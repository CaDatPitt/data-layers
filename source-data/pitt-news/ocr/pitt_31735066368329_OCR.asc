University of Pittsburgh profes-
sors may not be protected by the
university for violation of copy-
right laws, according to assistant
university counsel Ron Talarico.

According to Talarico, there is

no blanket policy on whether or _
not the university would stand’

behind a‘ professor accused of vio-
lating copyright laws.
“The university is responsible

for the actions of any employee
within the scope of their duties,”
Talarico said. “However, if a pro-
fessor has clearly acted improperly,
then the university would natu-
rally-try to disassociate itself from
that action.” .
Concern over the matter has been
prompted by a recent suit filed in a
U.S. District Court in New_York
against New ‘York University and

nine of its professors by several‘

publishing companies. .
The suit, which is the first of its

kind, seeks a permanent injunction
against further illegal photocopy-
ing and -an unspecified award for
damages to the copyright owners.

“Our professors are aware of the
copyright regulations,” said CAS
dean Irwin. Schulman, “Officially,
we are not supposed to. do that, but
it is difficult to police.”

A Schulman added that “the uni-
versity will do what it has to in
order to protect its professors in the
capacity of their job.”

In addition, the suit charges the

The Curriculum Reform
College Writing Board is meet-
ing success in its attempt to
implement “W” courses for the
1983 Fall term, according to

‘ CAS Dean Irwin Schulman.

The new -“W” courses are
designed as an alternative to the
basic or general, P writing
courses offered. Natalie Tull, a
student representative on the
Curriculum Reform Board,
said, “the ‘W’ courses are a way
in which students will not have
to ’ limit themselves in just
choosing basic or general writ-
ing in filling their writing
requirement.”

The “W” courses were pro-
posed by’ the board early in the
fall term, but they received little
response from departments
other than English at that time.
Since then, Schulman said,
“The suggestions for ‘W’
courses have been flooding in.”

The College Writin'g'Board is -
one of six committees estab-
lished by the _ Curriculum
Reform Board. Each committee

Courses To Be Implemented

consists of both faculty andistu-3
dents and has a specific purpose:
in developing and reviewing
course proposals. The College
Writing Board's major purpose
of this year is to implement the
“W” course system. '

“Each department must meet
a number of criteria in forming
a new ‘W’ course,” Tull said.
Tull outlined several of the
requirements: no more than 22
students must be enrolled in the
class to allow discussion and
individual feedback from the
professor, two to three “inten-
sive" writ_ing assignments (20-
25 pages) to enable feedback
and a period for revisions and at
least two “W" courses must be
taken in order to fulfill the writ-
ing requirement.

“The ‘W’ courses will be
offered in a variety of depart-
ments for students to diversify
their interest,” Tull said. Var-
ious departments, such as geol-
ogy, philosophy, German and
chemistry, all have submitted
proposals for introductory,
writing-focused courses, she
said: —
Curriculum Reform

Board will decide today which
courses it decides to accept.as
new “W” courses. Although the
deadline for next fall term
already has past, Tull said that
departments can still submit
proposals for “W” courses.

‘ Other curriculum reform
decisions are presently in the
making, Schulman said. “All
the committees meet regularly
and hundreds of courses have
been approved,” he said.

New writing and mathematic

- requirements have been in
effect since the 1982 fall term. As
a result of the placement test,
approximately 40 percent of.
incoming freshmen were
required to take an algebra
course and five percent were
required to take a basic reading
and writing course.

The new foreign language
requirements do not go into
effect until 1984. The foreign
language committee has not yet
discussed specific courses
which freshmen must enter.
Instead, ‘it is concentrating on
“improved -placement exams
anddifferent tracks of courses I
for students to follow.-”

 

The

Party    
Policy
Unclear

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The new moratorium placedfon
all parties in the dorms is so
unclear that even Resident Student
Association (RSA) president Jay
Nalli is unsure of its meaning. I

Nalli and the rest of the RSA
executive board met with the direc-
tor of the Office of Residence Life
(ORL), Jo Anne Woodson late yes-
terday to discuss what the policy
actually meant. a '

Nalli said that Woodson defined
a party as “a large group of people
with lots of beer.” Earlier in the
day, however, Woodson said -she

‘was unsure what the term “party”

actually meant.

“I think a party means a groupiof
people that are together but it may
or may not contain alcohol,” she.
said. , g A

At the meeting between RSA and
Woodson, it was determined that
there would be a ban on" large
amounts of alcohol (kegs, cases)
going into the dorms. ' ‘

Despite rumors circulating dur-
ing the day yesterday, Woodson did

Violators ,May Have Little   Protection

the NYU area, of photocopying’
unauthorized materials at the
request of the professors.

An employee, who wished to‘
remain anonymous, of Kinko’s
Copy Service on Forbes Ave. in
Oakland said that “any professor
who wishes to have copyrighted
materials photocopied must have a
letter from the publisher giving
authorization. ' ‘

"We won’t copy ‘ ore than one-
tenth of a book or a whole chapter,
and we make sure we have a copy of

ourselves." '

Photocopying parts‘ of a book or
article deprives writers and pub-«
lishers of royalties they would oth-
erwise receive, Talarico said.

“The NYU case is really a land-
mark one of which there is no
precedent," Talarico said. “The
issue is what constitutes fair use
and what doesn't, how many
copies can be made, how much of
an article can be used and what use

can be made of the materials,’.’ he . _

The dual program condenses
both degrees into three and one-

As the arms race continues to spi-
ral, the Soviet Union sees its
actions as responses designed to
deter the United States, which they
see as a threat, from launching an
attack,»according to Pitt political
science -professor Dr. Jonathan
Harris.

Harris spoke on “Soviet Percep- "
' tions of the Anns,Race" before the

Pitt Arms Race Study Group. The
group, in its-second year, examines
various aspects of nuclear war
every Tuesday at noon in the Eng-
lish department.

“The superpowers, in their
search for a credible deterrent, were
engaged in an arms race before the
age of nuclear weapons,” Harris

explained, “and Soviet thinking.

has been shaped a great deal by
concern with the world situation.”
He added for example that Soviet
concern became evident in Josef
Stalin's anxiety that the U.S.S.R.
was being encircled by capitalist
states.

Soviet anxieties and presump-
tions of external hostilities have
their sources on both ideological
and experiential levels, according
to Harris.

On the ideological level, he
explained that the Soviet leader-
ship sees war ‘as a result of im-
perialism and believes that to
eliminate imperialism,_the state
must be transformed into a social-
ist state. At an experiential level,
the West was seen as siding against
the Bolsheviks in the Russian
Revolution.

“The U.S.S.R. has concluded
that the U.S.A. is the leader of a
coalition opposing them,” Harris
said. “And their anxieties have
been reinforced again and again.”

There is, however, an ambiguity
in the Soviet'perception of the
American threat which is‘ parallel
to the ambiguity found in the U.S.
perception of the Soviet threat,
according to Harris.

“The U.S. is seen as a sort of
generalized threat,”

threat to the socialist systems in

Harris-
, explained. “At times, it is seen as a

P gfqlitl::lgiitlflllhlirlsjlWédfii¥sel21;l‘ijairifuilyl-l:§:'l§§3‘H ' A

Eastern Europe, and at other times, -

it is seen as moving toward war.”
He added that U.S. objectives,
however, are never clear.

In the Cold War, since Stalin's
death, the U.S.S.R. has been debat-
ing the nature of deterrence and
what will keep the U.S. at bay, Har-
ris said. As a result, hesaid that two
schools of thought have emerged.

The “minimum. deterrence”
school believes that the U.S. is
imperialistic and hostile, but also
that it is rational enough that all
the U.S.S.R. would need would be
a minimum deterrent. Effort there-
fore is directed toward building a

“lean, effective deterrent” Harris ,

said, and other resources are
invested into bettering the domes-
tic situation.

The “any eventuality” school
says that tobase military security
on a belief in the rationality of the
other side is naive. It maintains
that what is needed is a larger and
stronger deterrence, according to
Harris..

Another chance in Soviet think-
ing has also been the conclusion
that arms limitations are needed.

not say there would be a total ban
on alcohol, even smaller amounts,

Nalli was unsure about that also.
When asked if a student of legal age
would be let into the dorms with
only a six-pack,‘ Nalli said he was
uncertain. ' A

. “It depends on how the rule is
interpreted,” he said. “There’s no
clarity, nobody knows exactly what
it (the policy) says.” -

He said one desk attendant
might take the policy to mean that

, no alcohol is all-owed at all, while
another might think a.six-pack is
. permissible. r

The moratorium that is cur-
rently in effect is_ not being sup-
ported by RSA at all, Nalli said. He
also expressed dislike about the
way the policy was implemented.

“If they (administrators) ,con-
tinue to make policies without stu-
dent input, -it will be hard for a
group like RSA to give them sup-
port,” Nalli said.

Student activities director Andy
Smith has split the alcoholtask
force into three committees. All
three will use Pennsylvania state
law as a basis for their research but
take into account the three areas
that are being studied: the Pitt stu-
dent union and recognized organi-
zations, the fraternities and
sororities and the residence halls.

The committee studying the stu-

dent union willbe chaired by Ter-

rence Milani with Christine
Chergie and Gina Miller, both
from the office of student activities
as staff members. Student input
will consist of a representative
from the\ Graduate and Profes-
the

College of General Studies Student
Government Council and two
representatioves of " the Student
Government Board. ,

The committee studying alcohol
in the’ greek system will also be
chaired by Milani. Louis
McLinden and Larry Lunsford,
both from the office of student
activities, will be the staff members
on the Interfraternity Council and

-the Panhellenic Association plus

an officer from each of those
groups. ‘R

Finally, the resident halls com-
mittee will be chaired by Gerry
Kowalski, from the ORL. There
will also be two R"SA members, one
residence director, two resident
assistants, one Student Govern-
ment Board member, one represen-
tative from the housing office and
one desk attendant on that
committee.

Harris said that out of this
rethinking has come the Soviet
complex view that the U.S. is hos-
tile, but rational.

. “The missile placement in Cuba
in 1962 was an outgrowth of the
search for a deterrent that would
increase the Soviets’ capacity to
deal with the U.S.,” Harris
explained. “What took place there
was seen by the leadership as a
humiliating defeat. In addition, it
gave power to those who argued
that ’minimum deterrence was

_ nonsense.” ,

Today, President Reagan" and

the policies he represents are a real

problem from a Soviet perspective,
according to Harris.

“American leadership is divided
between the madman and the real-
ist,” he explained, “and Reagan is

seen as close to a madman.” He
added that a realist would be Eisen-
hower, a madman, John Foster
Dulles.

“The U.S.S.R. sees Reagan.a-s a
dangerous political leader," Harris
said, “and the MX missile is clearly
seen as a weapon that has first
strike capability—to be used
against the U.S.S.R." He added
that such policy represents a real
escalation of the arms race. if

Soviet leader Yuri Andropov has

made statements indicting that he’; 
is interested in negotiations, state- "

ments which Harris said should
not be dismissed so quickly.

“The statements should not be
perceived negatively,” he said. “To
dismiss them is to break a
momentum.”

The search continues for a
replacement for Provost
Rhoten Smith, who will be
retiring from his duties some-
time during the next academic
year.

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var said he could not divulge
any of the candidates’ names.
That information is kept confi-
dential to avoid any possible
embarrassment to the
candidates. .

Advertisements for the posi-
_tion ran in the December edi-
tions of The New York Times
and The Chronicle of Higher '
Education, and Posvar said he
had personally written 50 letters
to various university presidents
asking for recommendations.-

According to the ads, the pro-
vost’s job includes being
responsible, “through the
deans, for the undergraduate
and graduate programs in the
arts and sciences and in seven
graduate and professional
schools, as well as for all
regional campuses, all non-
medical basic and applied
' research centers, the university
library‘ system and all academic
support services.”

Search For New
Provostcontinues  

1|’ 
q‘\><A

Dr. Robert Glaser, chairman
of the search committee, said
that the-committee had initially
asked Smith to speak about his
job as provost/ senior vice chan-
cellor and the attributes that
Smith perceived as essential ‘to .
the new administrator filling
the position. -

Posvar said the effect that the
provost has on students is really
not felt by the students
themselves. '

“The impact on students is
long-term and indirect because
the provost has atremendous
influence on the recruitment of
faculty and on setting standards
and pursuing excellence,” Pos-
var said. “So any given student
may not in the near term feel the
impact, bf a new pro_vo'st, but

- students four or five years hence
will.” _

Under Smith's tenure, the
improvement of both the repu-
tation and the national ratings
of the various departments at
Pitt was seen.

__Smith said he would like to
pursue some of his own per-
sonal goals, such as doing some
reading, writing, teaching and
consulting, but mainly, he said,
he wants to “control his own
agenda” for a time. '

MORATO R l UM l
N0 5°°'e‘$ 
THE WHOLE non  ,g~~

At a Senate Council meeting last term, Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar assured his audience that
“there is no secret research being done at Pitt. At
least, none that we know of.” This does not
mean that we have no secrets.

Plans to eliminate the new careers educa-
tional p'rograrr1—a part of the University-
Community Educational‘ Programs
(UCEP)—were announced last year. The pro-
gram was designed to offer day classes and tui-
tion aid to older students who work for local
social agencies. A committee formed to discuss
the proposed cut has closed its doors to the
public. '

" Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg—whose office helps to fund the new
careers program—offered what seem to be good
reasons for ending the project, citing the with-
drawal of support by key groups originally
cooperating in the endeavor. There is no good
reason, however, to plan the program’s demise
in secret. .

Pitt also declines to reveal the names of some
corporations that contribute funds. The busi-
nesses involved have apparently asked for ano-
nymity; one cannot help but wonder why.

Some activities are justifiably kept secret
because publicity would spoil their effect.

. National security concerns often fall into this

category. Activities at Pitt do not, as the chan-
cellor’s pledge affirms. Some activities, on the
other hand, are kept secret because publicity
would reveal some wrongdoing and would
invite public condemnation, or because public-
ity would alert all sides in a controversy to
prepare to defend their interests. In both cases,
secrecy is not; justified. I

It may turn out that no harm will result from
this information being denied to the university

community. Still, a dangerous precedent could '

be set in the heart of an institution that once
celebrated the free exchange of information and
the unhindered pursuit of truth.

Evaluations Are Ineffective

Dear Editor:

In your Jan. 5 edition of The Pitt
News, a letter appeared concerning
mandatory faculty evaluations as
perceived by professor Fred Thayer
of GSPIA. As a\ fairly recent
transfer student from a small local
college where evaluations of
faculty were unheard of, and as a
student who does not agree with
the concept of faculty evaluations,
I would like to append several
remarks to those of professor
Thayer.

As professor Thayer states in his
letter‘, one of the many deficits
within the concept of mandatory
faculty evaluations is that they
allow a “Consumer Report” type
of shopping whenever a student is
making a choice of subsequent
courses.

. No doubt all students have at one
time or another asked friends who
have taken a particular course they
want to or must take what the

professor is like; perhaps not realiz-
ing that their-friends might be

lwake Up

Dear Editor: A

In response to Ron Barber's arti-
cle, “Too Young To Drink," I have
a bit of advice. I-Iey pal, it’s the '80s,
how about living in them.

It's an important and valid issue,
btit one that should be dealt with in

biased in their answer by‘ several
factors, i.e., the professor who

‘teaches that course might be teach-

ing a difficult course, or a course
wherein the student's area of exper-
tise is not based, leading to a non-
exemplary performance and

' consequent student dissatisfaction.

Thus, these mandatory evaluations
are a most effective student tool for
maliciousness and perhaps
unearned derision. Then, too, one
disgruntled student via word-of-
mouth “advertising” might well
do as much damage with negative
words as 20 students with poisoned
pens!

Professor Thayer continues in a
like vein by observing that the
methodology used by the OET is
an “agent for collecting data that
might be useful for administra-
tors." As an unwilling past partici-
pant in these evaluations, I can
affirm the absolute subjectivity and
apparent secrecy inherent in these
evaluations; they are not a real
judge of professorial competency.

Time For Change

to the moneymakers who pander
products any way they can, even if
it is to shift the blame for sexual
exploitation of children from the
adult to the child. It is an effective
way to numb public consciousness
about a large social issue—after all,
of the girls now 12 years of age, one
of three caii-expect to be raped in
her lifetime, according to conserva-
tive FBI estimates.

It is also nothing new to the likes
of even The New York Times, nor-
malizing and increasing our accep-
tance of child sexual abuse by
selling goods with Lolitots, pres-

enting girls as seductresses and"

relieving adults of their very real
responsibility.
You must be asking by now what

' it is I would have the PPC do. I

would like for them to do more

Is it possible that these evaluations
are fail-safe bastions of truth? Are
they the only real critique of teach-
ing abilities?

Again, as a student who is only
cognizant of one level of the faculty
evaluations, I cannot understand
the need for secrecy or the absolute
power that these evaluations wield.
If a student fears faculty reprisal for
a low faculty evaluation, i.e., a low
grade, perhaps undeserved,‘ then
obviously that ‘ faculty member
should not be in tea_ching. Alterna-
tively, any student who is doing
well in a course and has no major
complaints about a course should
utilize other means of expressing
his satisfaction with the course and
the instructor, perhaps through a
letter to that‘instructor’s dean (sic)
boss.

To quote professor Thayer,
“there is precious little evidence
that performance appraisal sys-
tems ever have worked very well in
any organization, _ public or pri-
vate." The irony of that statement
is that in order for any evidentiary
material to be collected and effec-
tively documented, some type of‘
survey/evaluation would have to
be developed. ‘ I

The main objective of any uni-
versity should be to educate stu-
dents. They are not factories, there
is no need for our “democratic"
society to allowa few disgruntled
students to perhaps destroy the
career of a member of the faculty
through the “secret_ballot”'cast pro
or con. .

Mandatory faculty evaluations
are perhaps one of the most ineffec-
tive tools in promoting better edu-
cation and should certainly not be
mandatory in a free society or uni-
versity.

._ The Pitt News, Wednesday Januaryll2, 1983‘ A

Since most undergrad students
have been at Pitt, sports have been
in the spotlight, outshining most
other university activities. Fans
cheered the Panthers at two top
football bowls in the past two years

- and they excitedly watched as the

team climbed to No. 1.
Students swarmed to the field
house to watch the Pitt basketball

‘ team battle Duquesne, and a good

deal of talk (both for and against)
about the elimination of two teams
last semester, women’s field hockey
and men’s volleyball, is going
around.

‘ When a whole university is caught
up in the excitement of a bowl game
. or important match, people usually
don't think of the financial aspect of
sports. However, at a time when
financial aid is being cut and stu-
dents are finding it harder and
harder to make it through college,
many are questioning just how
.much money goes into the athletic
department.

To understand how the budget is
decided upon, it is important to first
realize that the football team is not
considered part of the athletic
department because it generates its
own revenues. The football team,
band and cheerleading squad are
considered their own entity, intra-

‘ mural sports and physical education
classes are under the School of Edu-
cation, and the athletic department
includes everything else sports-
related

-._~. ,:

Pitt forms its budget by a process

‘commonly called “incremental. ’

budgeting,” which isbuilding upon
the “budget of each department,
rather than “zero-based” budgeting
or starting from scratch.

“You start with what you ’’need
based upon last year’s budget. said
John Yeager,‘ budgeting coordina-
tor at Pitt. _ _

Each school within the university
is given a list to see how they would
take certain reductions, according

, cut.

to Yeager. The majority of the
money that the athletic department
recovers from the cuts is about $3
million, and this goes towards new
programs and overhead expenses.

“To the extent possible we inter-
nally reallocate our funds,” Yeager
said, “particularly for the new
programs.”

They try to find money from state
appropriations and tuition increases
and use that money for salary

’increases, Ye_ager said.

 

The chancellor and vice chan-
cellor; as well as the athletic direc-
tor, ultimately review all of the cuts
and’ budgets. ‘

“This moves up the ladder,”
Yeager said. “It’s not a personal
choice of ‘this is what I’m going to

3!) .

Much discussion was aroused
when the athletic department
announced last month that they
were eliminating the women’s field
hockey and men’s volleyball teams.

. According to Yeager, these cuts -

were necessary.

PITT’S T

The Golden Panthers, formed
in 1972, is an organization
devoted to raising funds for Pitt’s
varsity athletic teams. Accord-.
ing to‘ Bob Heddleston, execu-
tive director of the Golden
Panthers, former athletic direc-
tor _Cas Myslinski started the
organization in an attempt to
bring together the different
groups supporting various Pitt
teams. . '

Before the‘ Golden Panthers
there were, for example, The

- Quarterback Club, which sup-
ported the football team, the
Grapplers, which supported
wrestling, and the Hoopers, for
basketball. _

9Last”year,'the Golden Pan-
thers raised $858,000 for Pitt

1 athletics. “Not enough money is
generated today through ticket
sales to support the teams,”
Heddleston said.

The organization has no con-
trol over how the funds are used;
athletic director Edward Bozik

‘determines the distribution.

Heddleston feels, however,
that the Golden Panthers play an
important role not only in fund-
raising, but in promoting Pitt in
areas other than athletics. By
keeping in touch with supporters
and recruits, the Golden Pan-
thers represent the university.

a minimum of $25 contribution
for the second year and $35 con- »
tributions for the following years
are required.

Membership, however, is not
limited to lettermen.

“Anyone can be a Golden
Panther. You don’t need to be a
Pitt graduate,.just a Pitt fan,”
Heddleston said. ,

Area stores give donations, as
do many volunteers who work
hard to promote Pitt. Different
chapters of the Golden Panthers
are set up throughout the state,
and they help recruit athletes by
keeping in touch with them. ,

The East Suburban Chapter
of the Golden Panthers was

hosting of the national Soviet
men’s gymnastic team last term.
Through the contributions of
friends and alumni of Pitt, the
Golden Panthers do their best to
raise money for the university’s
teams. .
“We're just trying to help the

Dean Billick reviews the budget situation.

.“We’ve been doing this process
for a while and you find that you can
only take so much out of travel
expenses, only so much out of per-
sonnel,” Yeager said. “You have to
take out a whole program or activity
in order to save the money.”

According to Yeager, about 1.4
percent of the total university oper-
ating budget will go towards the
athletic department and football in
1983. Part of that percentage is for
auxiliary teams as well as-funds for
non-revenue producing sports,

There‘ are a total of-14 men’s

_ sports and nine women’s teams at

Pitt. Men’s basketball and football
collect revenues, while collectively,
the others do not collect a “signifi-
cant” profit, according to Dr.
Edward Bozik, athletic director at
itt.

The non-revenue producing
sports operate at a budget of about
$500,000 each. This includes the
coach’s and assistant coach’s salar-

ies as well as scholarships for partici- .

pating athletes, Bozik said.

Scholarships for athletes are con-
sidered “financial aid” by the athletic
department and the total scholar-
ship costs for all sports (including
football) last year came to $984,000.
About $858,000 of that came
directly from the Pitt Golden Pan-
thers, an alumni fund-raising group.

Football is considered an entity
distinct from the athletic depart-
ment because it revenues from sea-
son football tickets, television
appearances and bowl games.

Football is also considered an
“auxiliary” sport because overhead
money is needed from the beginning
for basics such as capital improve-
ments and salaries.

The overhead for the football"
teamlast ~year..was $1.1 million and

,;navm:=.nt.;-ito. tic-ketatakers.:;.soublic'?:-

relations people, equipment and
trainers.- ' . ‘

Last year the football team gener-
ated a surplus of $800,000, and
Bozik predicts a $1.5 to $1.7 million
profit from this past season. This
money goes back into the general
university fund, according to Bozik,
and will be spent on items such as
the libraries and the maintenance of
the stadium.

For example, next fall they plan to
get artificial turf which will cost
three-quarters of a million dollars,
Bozik said. The stadium facilities are

also used for soccer, intramurals,

gym classes and band activities, and
its upkeepis expensive. 3
“We’re dealing with big dollars,
’ but we're also dealing with big
expenses.” Bozik said. He added
that in comparison with other
schools’ athletic departments, “ours
is a very lean program.”
- Bozik claimed that-‘ the athletic
department has sustained a $240
million loss since 1976 because of
budget cuts and that they have to
cut from areas other than the two
teams that were recently eliminated.

“My choice to eliminate (those
teams) originated with the Athletic
Committee,” Bozik said. .

He said that the athletic depart-
ment had met with the chancellor

,(“<a'ri‘d-"decided that if they had to cut

funds from a sport, quality would
suffer. It would be more-worthwhile,
they decided, to cut two sports
teams altogether and concentrate
on the ones that remained.

Many wondered how the univer-
sity could afford to send not only the
Pitt football team to the Cotton
Bowl but the band and cheerleaders
as well, yet have to cut two teams
just a few weeks earlierbecause of
lack of funds.

8 “For those who would say, ‘How
can you afford to send that band to
Dallas,’ well, that band has been at
every football g me,”.Bozik said. .

\tance of allowing the band to travel»

to the Cotton Bowl free of charge.
“When you make a committment
to a major football team and enjoy
the advantages of that,” he said,
“you have to supply a band and
cheerleaders like a coach and eqi.Qp-
ment. You just have to have it.”

Bozik said that the profit made’
from the football team makes up for
its expenses. ‘ '

“If we eliminated the athletic
department, would the other sec-
tors of the university gain anything
from that? There would be a net loss
because of the revenues we gener-
ate,” he said.

Last season, the football team‘
generated a gross income of $4.2
million and had been allocated $3.4 .
million. $1.1 million went back into
the university by way of athletic
scholarships as financial aid,
according to Bozik, and proper

» operating expenses for football are

about $1.7 million.

As the only other revenue- -""'
producing sport besides football,

the men’s basketball team has not
been able to generate a surplus for
the past couple of years. Last year

-alone they fell short about $40,000,

Bozik said.

The athletic department is opti-
mistic, however, that things will get
better since the team’s recent entry
to the Big East conference.

“We feel totally confident that this
year we’ll be in a break-even posi-
tion,” Billick said.

The women’s basketball team
‘also entered the Big East confer-
ence, as well as six other teams. ‘I

sports at Pitt is worth the loss all the

Taking into account the number
of Division I intercollegiate athletic
programs in the country, Pitt ranks
considerably -below other institu-
tionswhen it comes to funding. The

"sampling. is based on competitive-

ness, and the reason for the low-
level centers around poor financing

A in a rigidly depressed economy.

This, according to associate
athletic director Dean Billick, played

a role_ in the recent cancellations of

women’s field hockey and men’s vol-
leyballand has to put up with the
criticism aimed at his department.

“We have received the same per-
centages of cuts in the last four or

< five years,” he said. “Still, there’s a

misconception out there that’s
probably fostered when people see
figures -on TV revenue coming in for
football ($1.9 million for the Cotton
Bowl). ' .

“You know, like we’re rich fatcats
on -the top of the hill. It’s simply not
true.” ‘

Billick’s ‘statements are proved
more or less correct by Dr. Wilfried
 Daehnick. He is in his second

appointment as chairman on the
Senate Budget Policies Committee.

Daehnick estimated, Pitt’s overall
' budget at $200 million five years ago,

complimented by 9 percent

_ inﬂation. .a A

Accordingly, there would be
requests of 9 percent more to match

inﬂation dollar—for-dollar. From 1976 '

to ’81, however, Daehnick said the
cost-of-living rate rose 61.5 «percent,

' while Pitt’s budgetary figures could

only keep a 50.1 percent pace.

“There’s an 11 percent differ-
ence,” ‘Daehnick said, “while state
income had only risen by 22 percent
in the same period. As a result, we
must scale back salaries (which
have increased by approximately 40
percent), cut back on faculty (2 per-
cent overall) and reduce program
contributions.” -

Except for the football program,
every varsity team is dependent
upon monies from a general univer-
sity fund. The only current’ profit-
making team at Pitt, football relies
on an auxiliary enterprise system
into which goes all its income and
out of which comes monies for var-
ious expenditures.

Almost nothing comes free of
charge to the nationally-known
squad. The auxiliary fund is used to
pay for building use, stadium time
and a certain amount of athletic

,-department . administrators’ salar-

ies, among other expenses.

About 65-70 percent of Billick’s
contract is paid for by this auxiliary
fund because of the amount of his

‘time spent with football matters.

During the year when his adminis-

tration cut two non-revenue pro-.
- ducing squads, Billick announced

another productive year for the
Associated Press’ 10th-ranked
team. -

“This year was a healthy financial
situation,” he commented. “There
are no bottom-line figures yet, but I
would venture to say (football)
made the most money in the history
of the school.” —

_Billick ,r_apid_ly_ p.oin__ted_ o,u,t, ,

excess of $5 million) is sent to an
“account for the physical plant._”

Usually, Billick said, that excess
revenue will go back to improving
some of the athletic facilities during
subsequent years, even though the
university makes the final decision
on what money is spent where.‘

Despite this, there are still certain
funds to which athletic director
Edward Bozik has access. That is
where Daehnick’s 12-member com-
mittee comesin play. As one of its
various responsibilities, this budget
committee keeps Bozik’s allocation

' decisionsfrom leaving the public

viewpoint. .

“The Athletic‘ Committee is in
constant consultation,” Daehnick
said, “with Dr. Bozik to optimize
money use. This is an educational
area and does not deal with budget
committees, but we do bring up dif-
ferent proposals from time to time.

“It’s just as if one’s parents asked
for a personal accounting of their
k_id’s spending . . . penny for penny.”

It is apparently not an enviable
task for Billick and his department

"to st_retch?every"penny as far as

possible.

“We are really funded to the base.
bone,” he said. “The university, on
the other hand,has been fair to us.
The fact is, we do not have great
dealsof money, and I understand

H why we do not. -

“Our costs have not gone up, but
inﬂation has gone up.” '

When it comes to filing fiscal —

budgets, the athletic department
has had to deal with yearly budget
cuts for the last five. It does not,
however, budget with anticipation
such as future TV appearances.

Several years ago, Billick
recounted, there was a West Virgi-
nia athletic director who was
“promptly carted away because the
TV appearance he budgeted for
never panned out.” Actions like
that, Billick said, lead to irresponsi-
ble business practices. .

During the recent half decade,
while dealing with budget cuts, ‘Boz-
ik’s department had been spreading
its funding as far as possible.

“We’ve been cut back and we’ve
cut back till there was no other place
to cut" (the budget),” Billick said.
“We didn’t want to spread medioc-
rity and continue to spread it to the
point our programs weren’t going to
be at all competitive. _

“It was a conscientious decision
(cutting the two programs) made
after a" lot of thought and was a
‘recommendation that was for-

’ warded over one and a half years

ago. There wasn’t any more to cut.”

I In his 18th year at Pitt, the former
sports information director said that
other factors, including travel
budgets and scholarship funding
were accounted for. -

On those same program cuts,
Daehnick said there cguld have
been another route to t”ake,"°but
questioned whether that is in Pitt’s
best interests.

. “From Dr. Bozik’s point of view,

\

conclusion reached by him and the_

athletic department is they wanted
to support more sports, but they
would do it without more money.

“Who am I to argue with that? I
think these are honorable people
not shooting from the hip.”

Perhaps one person to argue with
the existence‘ of intercollegiate
athletics is . CAS Dean Irwin
Schulman.

On big-time college athletics, he
said, “On a nationwide scale, what’s
happened during the last generation
(since WWII) concurrent with an
increased rate of growth has been

Were it not for Pitt’s booster
funds, raised through the Golden
Panthers organization, the depart-
ment would be in a "worse state of
affairs. Over the past several years
the Golden Panthers, according to
Billick, “went from $400,000 to
$650,000 to $858,000 thisiyear.”-.

. These figures pale in comparison
to what Billick hopes will be a
banner fund-raising drive starting
March 1 and ending June 30, which
is the end of the fiscal year. In that
-period, he projects an accumulation
of $1.1 million—an all—time record.

He said a majority of this will go to
aid sports other than football. Just

DOES PITT SPEND TOO MUCH oN SPORTS?

because it’s a good representative
and brings in endowments and out-
side benefactors and cuts back on
university expenses.”

Just as Billick stretches the dol-
lars he receives, Dieffenbach sim-
ilarly optimizes his opportunities,-
considering he has no scholarship
money and “inadequate athletic
facilities.” Through a “master plan,”
he hopes to see new tennis facilities
built behind Pitt Stadium within two
years. I

have gotten to the point where they
have been turned “into fami sys-
tems.” There ,was a certain spirit
that prevailed up until WWII, he

said, that equaled the ancient ideal,

of sports being an integral part of the
student as it was in Rome and
_Greece. That spirit has now eroded
today’s standards.

Schulman said, “Today, athletics 1

is commercialized entertainment.
Sports "is driving universities. Do
universities have “sports or is it the
other way around?”

The Dean knows, however, that
he is dealing with modern times and‘
concedes that Pitt’ is better than
other schools since he said it keeps
a sense of control over its students.

‘If he ‘had things his way, though,’

sports would go by the wayside.

“If I were in an ideal world I would
not have a commercialized pro-
gram. I’d rather not have athletic
programs with booster funds,
coaches, and scholarships. They
really are not what universities are

all about,” he said. _

this year $500,000 was dispensed for
scholarships, a bundle of which

A went to football.

Given what his department has to I

work with, Billick believes his
administration is making an honest
effort to run an honest intercolle-
giate athletic program.

“I think our high-level athletic

competiveness brings numerous
returns to the university and a tre-
mendous public relations value.
This is a tremendous source of
recruitment for students; arecogni-
tion factor for the university. ‘

_“Athletics in America are very
highly visible today. We can use this
visibility to promote the University
of Pittsburgh,” he said.

Listen to tennis coach George
Dieffenbach and one would proba-
bly hear similar sentiments.

“I’m behind the administration in
whatever it does,” he said.

He too understands Pitt’s predic-
ament as it weathers the bad storm
of an economy. To carry sports,
Dieffenbach said, any university
should "dose as long as the revenue
comes in. ~

a ‘‘I’m pretty content with the allo- I
cations I now receive,” Dieffenbach, -: _ V A
..  C’-V‘-We donft walk on ‘water-—

  
  

six-figure revenue by renting court
time. ’ ‘ _ -
“That is their number two genera-_,
tor of money," Dieffenbach said of
Penn State’s indoor tennis facilities.
“They pack that facility from 8am.
to 10 p.m. during the winter months,
for eight months. It’s got to be at
least $200,000.”

That Dieffenbach is on the receiv-
ing end ‘of a funding infusion bodes
well for him since Pitt is presently
struggling to remain as competitive

as possible, with the little money it —

receives.

Billick refused to release any‘
budgetary figures, but did explain ‘
that there are other institutions‘far- _'
ing better in allocations. For exam- ‘
ple, Florida State keeps all its teams a

An O|dAcquaintance Returns

By SCOTT DELLETT

A The last time the Panther basket-
ball team met Villanova, both
teams were struggling to gain some
rational respect. After the Wildcats
earned an Eastern 8 championship,
including a 72-53 win over the
Panthers in the semi-finals, Villa-
nova decided its best interests
would be better served in the
newly-founded_ Big East con-
ference.

The results of the move are clear;
a Big East regular season cham-
pionship last year along with a
berth in the NCAA Eastern
Regional finals. Meanwhile, Pitt
decided the-Eastern 8 was too small
and that the Big East would benefit
the growing program.

It will be seen how much the
Wildcats have improved in three
years as the Panthers host Villa-
nova at the Fitzgerald Field House
tonight at 8 p.m. _

John Pinone and Steward
Granger were contributing fresh-
men on the 1979-80 team; today
they are integral parts of a national
power currently 8-2.2-0 in the Big
East—-and ranked 17 by United
Press International. The 6-8 center
leads the Wildcats with 16.6 points
per game while Granger is second
with just over 15 points per contest.

I zine All-America

But Villanova is more than these
two. Forward Ed Pinckney is consi-
dered one of the best sophomores in
the nation. Pinckney is second in
the Big East in rebounding, averag-
ing over nine boards a game.

“There is no way we can stop

_ their inside game,” assistant coach

Reggie Warford said. “We just
have to slow them down.”

Success on the court means suc-
cess on the recruiting trail, and Vil-
lanova picked up one of the most
coveted freshmen in the nati_on,
Harold Pressley,a Parade Maga-
last year. The
6-7 forward has been able to crack
the starting lineup, averaging six
points a game.

“There’s talent throughout their
lineup,” Warford said.

Meanwhile, the Panthers must
see if the hard work in practice can
help them against top-caliber
competition.

“Coach (Chipman) has been
fairly pleased with the effort in
practice,” Warford said. “They
sense that they have to work hard in
order to be competitive.”

If the Panthers lose tonight, their
record in the Big East conference
will drop to 0-3. Still, Warford
believes the team isn't atthe critical
stage of the season to worry about
conference records.

“Your can’t play a team as good

as Villanova and say it's a must

game,” Warford said. “We are con-
cerned with playing a good game.
We must‘ play well in order to gain
confidence.”

Confidence to face a team like
Villanova, a team who once was in
the class of Pitt but now has joined
the elite. An elite the Panthers
would like to join in the near
future.

inexperienced Divers Face Big Test

By MARK A. SINDIER

Suppose a poll was taken and the
people interviewed were coaches of
every type of team sport. One of the
questions on the poll asked the
coach what would produce a win-
ning team.

There are many variables, but
the majority would probably
depend on a combination of talent
and determination. That would
produce success—skill and expe-
rienced athletes.

Pitt diving coach Julian Krug
now has one of those two
qualities—skill—in his squad and
he anticipates that experience will
soon be acquired, making his team
one of the best in the East.

Currently, five of the seven divers

" he coaches are freshmen. One is
redshirted and the other is not pres-

ently competing.

“We are doingvery well for who
we are. There is a good crop of
freshmen, but there is no substitute
for time and training,"said Krug.
F (;l‘he fiesiniietl diyers are capable.

ience but only through competi-
tion and training. Krug rates them
the best in the East, with the excep-
tion of Harvard.

Of Penn State's divers, Krug sees
junior Dale Dmitrzak as the tough-
est one to beat. Dmitrzak, cham-
pion in the East last year, was a
prospect out of Pitt's age-group
swimming program while in high
school, but opted to attend Penn
State for its architecture program.

Although Krug limits his chan-

B ces of defeating Dmitrzak, he will

throw a healthy squad at Penn
State on Saturday at 1:00 at Trees
Hall. “I'll be happy to sneak some
seconds," Krug said, “but by next
year we should be able to fight
them on a pretty even basis."

"We do have the talent; we just
need the time."

Krug's No. l man will be Mark
Mc(lonnick, who is strong in the
big leg lift, but not “nearly as con-
sistent as Dale." John Dusch also
received high marks from his coach
but must contend with his body

&

  

        

Freshmen McCormick, Dusch
and Todd Mulzet, were in the finals
last year in the state high school
meet at Penn State.

Krug said his women divers, who
round out his combined squad of
10, are “not nearly as deep or as
strong" as the men he coaches.
Sophomore Yvonne Johnston (to
whom he refers as the best) and
freshmen Tricia Schultz and Vicki
Matthews have already competed
against Tennessee, Syracuse and

Michigan, which has the best
women's diving team in the
country.

()f his men’s and women's

squads, Krug said, “We have an
excellent team, but we can’t expect
to hop in there and kick ass right
away.

Krug seems content with where
both his squads stand now. There's
only so much he can accomplish
with the very young athletes he
now. has. But those athletes are the
ones that will become big contend-

By TIM DINGER

The Pitt Parither wrestling team
opened its Eastern Wrestling
League season last night by defeat-
ing the West Virginia Mountai-
neers, 23-12 at the Fitzgerald Field
House. It’ was the first time since
1977 that the Panthers have beaten
the Mountaineers.

“It was a great performance by

an upcoming team,” wrestling"

coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “We
knew there were going to be some
tough matches, i but we pulled
through great. We won some
matches that we weren't supposed
to win and that gave us the edge.
I'm glad to see our older guys com-
ing in and really helping us out.”

Pitt's Kyle Nellis opened the
match with a double-leg takedown
to take a 2-0 lead over West Virgi-
nia’s Jeff Leaf in the first period.
Nellis scored a nearfall in the
second period and a tilt and a rever-
sal in the third period on his way to
a 10-1 major decision.

Nellis moves his record to 10-2,
the best on the Panther squad.

At the 126-lbs. weight class,
freshman John Hnath opened his

match by giving West Virginia's,

Mike Levenduski a two-point take-
down, but he battledback with an
escape and a takedown for a 3-2
lead in the first period. A Leven-
duski escape tied the match at three

in the second period, but a third.

period reversal by Hnath gave him
the 5-3 victory.

At 134-lbs. freshman Gary Bolin
of Pitt stepped in against Mountai-
neer Harry Hritsko only to fall 6-5

in a hard-fought battle. Down 5-2'

going into the second period, Bolin
scored an escape and a takedown to
tie the match at five apiece. Hritsko
stalled his way through the third
period, and in the end winning 6-5

- by riding time.

At 1'42-lbs. Craig Richey of Pitt
opened the match with a pair of

takedowns and a nearfall to take a B

7-1 lead over West Virginia's How-
ard Wilson in the first period. With
a 10-2 lead going into the third
period, Richey scored a nearfall
and a takedown to. pull out a 15-3
superior decision. Richey’s record
remains 4-0.

Basketball In‘ Pittsburgh.”

Can Panthers Swim
With Colorful Fish?

A new‘ sequel to a rather old movie: “The Big Fish That Saved

At a time when basketball in this city was dying faster than
flowers after the first freeze, the Big East, with its rim—shaking
centers, twine-tingling guards and power-laden forwards, has gal-
loped into town on a Great White Horse.

"40-  ‘ ‘#9.

U

 

The setting was perfect: A rundown basketball area where great
moments of the past were embedded somewhere beneath the Civic
Arena and Pitt Field House floors. The professional teams—the
Pipers and Condors—folded like a stunt man taking a John Wayne
punch; Duquesne had rescinded its commitment to big time basket-
ball when it fired coach Mike Rice and hired Jim Satalin, who‘
supposedly has a better concept as to the mission of Duquesne
University.

Pitt was dropping too, playing in a league where seven-footers
never ventured, where the few talented players were often obscured

in a maze of sloppy games and where national acclaim was blocked '

out by a lack of respect from outsiders.

And then, the movie-makers threw in a touch of irony: By leaving
the Eastern 8, er, whatever it is now, for the Big East, Pittjeopardr
ized what was the final trace of basketball life here—the Pitt-
Duquesne rivalry. The coffin was nailed shut.

But even while the hammer was pounding away, the bright
horizon was quite visible. The reminders were numerous: A man
from Georgetown named Ewing and his team, the Hoyas, along
with three other Top-Twenty teams—Syracuse, St. John's’and, get
this, Villanova. '

Producers must have stayed awake for nights thinking up this
plot. Like Pitt, only a few years earlier, Villanova left the Eastern 8
for the Big East, looking to build a powerhouse. The Wildcats have
won the gamble, and now it is Pitt’s turn to roll the dice.

The script does not end there. Scene One saw Pitt lose its first two
games in the new league. Scene Two, which begins tonight at the
Field House, gets even juicier. Pitt meets up with an old friend on
its own turf, a team that the Panthers must envy.

Villanova returns to the Pitt campus. At last check, its coach,
Rollie Massimino, was still shedding his clothes during games, still
winging his arms like he was preparing to fly through the roof.

Pitt Coach Roy Chipman won't try to match Massimino's antics,
but he sure wouldn’t mind duplicating what the Villanova pro-
gram has done in just a few short years in the Big East. National
rankings. NCAA tournament. A lot of respect from the opposition.
The Wildcats have just about reached the pinnacle.

The Panthers have a long way to climb, for all of what Villanova
has accomplished is just a dream for Pitt. Right now, Pitt is search-
ing for respectability. The Wildcats have raised their sights to a
national championship.

Which makes tonight's game appear like a mismatch. Pitt, it
would seem, should be tossed out of the Field House by Massimino
and the Wildcats. Simple as this: Villanova can shoot and rebound
for a higher percentage than Pitt" can. A

Pitt's advantage: It has played Villanova before, has defeated
them in big‘ games and will have a rejuvenated Pittsburgh crowd in

A its. corner. _ ,3 _ "C . 2 J '- -'

Panthers Look  
To Tall La Salle

By TAMMY ANDERSON

Big things are coming this way
for the Lady Panthers basketball
team this week. And these big
things may cause some rather tall
problems as Pitt faces LaSalle Uni-
versity tonight and Cheyney State
Sunday.

LaSalle will be a problem for
Pitt for many reasons. Perhaps the
mostinoticeable is that LaSalle has
three players standing at 6-7, 6-3
and 6-2.

“There is no doubt that
LaSalle’s great size will be an
important factor in the game,"
coach Judy Saurer said. “However,
a bigger factor in the game might
be the full-court pressure that they
have often used in the past.”

Last year, the Lady Panthers
split games with LaSalle, losing
the first and winning the rematch.
The Lady Panthers have faced
many full-court presses through-
out the season and has gained expe-
rience in breaking the press. ~..

“-I cannot definitely say if
LaSalle will or will not utilize a
full court pressure in their

defense,” Saurer said. “However, if
they do, I feel as if we will be able to

handle ourselves well because with
each game, our guards gain confi-
dence in breaking presses.
Although a press can influence a
games outcome, it is only a facet of
a defense. We will face other
important factors in the game."

Sophomore tri-captain Jennifer
Bruce, recently named Big East
Converse Player of the Week for her
performance in the past two games,
will play a big part for the Lady
Panthers tonight. Bruce is averag-
ing 20 points and 10 rebounds a
game. Senior tri-captain Pam Mik-
lasevich will also provide a major
contribution to Pitt’s play. Bruce
and Miklasevich have led Pitt’s
scoring attack so far this season.

If LaSalle does concentrate on
stopping Bruce and Miklasevich,
the younger Lady Panthers must be
able to take over and take up the
scoring slack. .

“Pam and Jennifer's scoring and
overall performances have been
very big factors in our games and
have acted as a stabilizing agent in
our play," Saurer said. “Although
Pam and Jennifer have led in scor-_
ing so far this season, we have other
players who are capable of effective

Following a month of rigorous
training and two fine season open-
ing performances, the Pitt Panther
track team faces its toughest chal-
lenge of the season this weekend.

The Panthers will travel to East
Tennessee State for one of the most
prestigious events of the indoor
track season, the Eastman Kodak
Invitational. This meet attracts
most ‘top-notch programs in the
country.

Concerning this competition,
head coach John Vasvary said,
“Kansas, UCLA, Alabama; they’ll
all be there. It is as good a group of

Panthers

The Pitt News,”Wedhesday January I2, 1983

teams as will be present at any meet
this year."

Since the meet is run early in the
year, it provides the competing
schools with both needed expe-
rience and an indication as to
where the team is headed.

The highly regarded Panther
two-mile relay team, which was
one of six teams in-the country to
break the NCAA record last year,
will undergo its first big test of this
season. The team will consist of
Todd Colas, Garland Brown, Dar-
rin Geary and Terry Gallagher.

Pitt will field two other relay

teams. In the mile relay, Darrin’

Geary, Dee Baynes, Brian Pollock

scoring. LaSalle will probably
pressure Jennifer and Pam so our
younger girls will have to play well
for us to be successful tonight."
Although the game is not a Big

East contest, the Lady Panthers are »

not taking LaSalle lightly. Pitt's
plans are to first prepare for the
game with LaSalle as though it
were a Big East game and then to
prepare for Cheyney State on Sun-

day. Cheyney is last year's NCAA

champion and is currently 8-1.
“Although Big East games count ‘

the most, we treat every game with

- equal importance, one at a time,”

Saurer said. “LaSalle is a very good
team, but Cheyney is a great team.
Our objective right now is to play
as well as we can tonight against
LaSalle. Only after that will we

look to and prepare for our game ' i

with Cheyney. ”

This Saturday, the Pitt Lady
Panther swim team will take on
Penn State at Trees Pool. Coach
Dave Belowich believes that this
will be a good, close meet in terms
of swimming times. He’s optimis-
tic about his squad’s prospects as
he believes the team is beginning to

gel.

While most Pitt students were
facing the Pennsylvania cold over
break, Belowich and his swimmers
traveled to the more pleasant cli-
mate of Puerto Rico to train. Dur-
ing the training period, the squad
did extensive work in the water and

*zramt;.aiy =12 ‘tbs?’ 

a lot of running. This training has
put his team into excellent condi-
tion for the rest of the season.

“The meet with Penn State is dif-
ficult to predict," Belowich said,
“because it's our first meet in overa
month."

Despite the long layoff, Belo-
wich is still looking for improve-
ment, and he is confident that he
will see progress. According to
Belowich, the team's attitude is
excellent. They‘have been working
hard and speeds have improved.

Looking at specifics of the meet,
Belowich said that, as usual, Jan
Ugevich and Sue Heon are being
counted on to do a good job by

will Layoff Hurt Swimmers?

taking first places. He also expects
freshmen Alicia Dugan and Denise
Rickett and sophomore Laurie
Barber to perform well. Freshman
walk-on Kristin Salezki impressed
Belowich in Puerto Rico, and he's
planning to use her in future
meets.

At the beginning of the season,
the breaststroke was a bit‘ weak, but
Belowich has seen improvement,
especially in Diana Firth, Wendy
Morgan and Estelle Grant.

Belowich said that the Penn
State squad reminds him a lot of
last year’s Pitt squad—strong all
down the line. Despite Penn State’s
strength, Belowich is confident
that his team will do well.

Panthers Pin West Virginia

continued from page eleven

down to his back to take a quick 4-0
lead in the first period. In the third
period, Bond combined a nearfall
and a reversal to blank Derose 12-0.

After a scoreless first period at
158-lbs., Mountaineer Kurt Ander-
son scored a nearfall over Pitt’s
Doug Haines to take a 2-0 lead, but
Haines scored a reversal to tie the
match at two apiece in the second
period. In the third,it was all And-
erson scoring a nearfall, takedown
and a reversal, beating Haines ll-4.

At 167-lbs., Pitt’s Jeff Jelic tooka
4-l first period lead on a pair of
takedowns over West Virginia’s
Wilbur Wolf. Jelic then scored an
escape and a takedown to win 8-2.

]elic’s record moves up to 9-3.

At 177-lbs., Mountaineer Randy
McKinney scored a riding time
point at the end of the match to
edge out Pitt’s Frank Rich 6-5.

At l90-lbs., West Virginia’s R.].
Costello scored a quick takedown
and nearfall over Kurt Karanovich
to take a 4-0 lead, but Karanovich
battled back with ‘a reversal and a
nearfall to tie the match at 4 in the
first period. A reversal by each left
the match tied at 6-6. A stalling
point against Costello and a
penalty point against Karanovich
again tied the match, but riding
time advantage gave the panther
the 8-7 edge. Karanovich moves his
record to 6-I-l.

Bill Nye of West Virginia scored
two takedowns and a nearfall to
take a 6-1 first-period lead over
Pitt’s Dan Kasperkoski at the hea-
vyweight match. Nye went 0:‘. to
win ll-6 to close the match.

“I’m happy, I’m pleased, but this
is not where we want to be," said
Stottlemyer. “It was a great perfor-
mance, but we still have a long way
to go. It was a positive experience
for us. We’re really making
progress.” '

The Panthers, now 3-1 over all
and 1-0 in Eastern Wrestling
League competition, will take to
the road for a match at Millersville
against Millerville State and Ship-
pensburg State on Saturday.
