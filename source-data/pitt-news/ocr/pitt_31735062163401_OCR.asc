" Emphasizing the appeals rather than active nature of th
board‘ Dr. Rankin commented, “It is designed for P9130115
‘who feel that they have not been treated favorably by some
area of the University, after they have exhausted the normal
\ channels” i.e., the head of that area. ‘ .-

motivated “by a number of suggestions for such a com1nit-
tee,” including. a request from Irv Garﬁnkle of the student
Ad Hoc Committee on Discrimination. .. -'

Chairman of the committee is Professor Edward Sell
of the Law School. Members include Dr. Stanton C. ‘Craw-

In questions involvingstudents, James Kleinberg, chair-
man of the Student Government committee on discrimination,
will serve as a student observer. I

‘LA Cabinet Takes /lotion

By JACKI KATZ

Since the Liberal Arts Cab-
inet began its analysis of the
distribution courses, many
complaints have been "receiv-
ed, according to Fern‘ Chag-
rin, a member of the cabinet.

Two days after a complaint was
lodged about a.cou‘rse; the original
instructor was. replaced, Miss
Chagrin explained. .

The cabinet has "received other
complaints and is taking action on
them, Miss Chagrin said. In one
case, a. letter was received from
a student complaining about a
course and professor. The Cabinet
sent a representative to the pro-
fessor's lectures and the represen-
--tative is trying to discover wheth-

without, the ending.

Wagner’s Idea Now Reality    

Missy Wagner
Speaks to Youth

By BRONNIE MASON

Miss Friedelind Wagner, grand
daughter of famous composer
Richard Wagner, prefers American
,-student ‘musicians to Europeans.
because “their training and music
al background is better and there
‘are not as many primadonnas.” _

Her youthful, almost timeless,
features reflect her interest in
youth which stems from the esta
blishment of her Master Classes

at the family home in Bayreuth, ~

Germany.

Purpose of Classes _

The purpose of the Master
“to teach the students how to
build a theatre to the ﬁnished per-
formance.” The classes, originally
her grandfather’s idea, run during
the summerlconcurrently with the
Summer Musical Festival at the
Bayreuth theatre built by Richard
Wagner for the performance of
Iieves that in the United States

his operas.

Miss Wagner chooses her stu-
dents on the basis of personal
interviews and auditions. An
ideal student, she asserts, is one
who has “manifold talents.” Last
summer’s class was top-heavy in
Americans and Miss Wagner
jokingly says, “There is a rumor
in Germany that I don't like
Germans.”

Emphasis On Competition Here
She feels that “Americans work

a

harder because of the emphasis
placed on competition here. “In
the United States, musicians must
audition every year to maintain
their positions. In Europe, security
is killing; musicians learn just
enough to stay in.”
However, Miss Wagner be-
there is little opportunity for
the gifted students to express
their talent. She thinks. there
is no market in America for the
“perfect product,” American
musical talent. “How many
operas a year do you have here

United Nations’ Goals

(Continued from Page 1)

“Before 1945 the U.N. was
fantasy,” noted Bhat. “After
that year it has become a fact.
It can be viewed from a light
as to whether it was effective
in the past, or whether it will
be effective in the future.”

He explained that hadit not
been eﬁective,Ait would not have
doubled in size since 1954.

Praises Test Ban

Citing colonialism, racism and
nuclear weapons as key threats to
international se curity, Bhat
praised the signing of the recent
nuclear test ban as a step in the
direction of peace. _

He emphasized the functional
approach of the U.N. to
‘strengthen world peace -in so-
cial and economics levels, not-
ing that “though conﬂict exists,
good will also exists on many
plains because of the U.N.”

Dr. Holden interjected the four
principle aims of the U-N- He
asked panel members if the)’
thought “there are inconsistancies
in the aims.”

' 11-Member Council *

Gay told the audience that the
Security Council of the U.N. is
composed of 11 members—ﬁve
permanent.

“This means six are elected
every two years.” he said-
“There is a monopoly held by
the ﬁve permanent members on
this important function of the
IJ.N.” .

Pointing out the veto power of
the ﬁve permanent members of
the Council, Gavy declared. the
principle of equality of rights
among members is a myth.

’ Solve ‘Big’ 'I’1'0b10mS ,

Rech commented, “The ‘powers
who created the charter in 1945
were winners of the war (World
War II) and wanted to prevent
further war. They felt to solve
problems the “big’ powers must
meet.” -

However, he noted that the

and, by being great powers, they
naturally command activities in

by the major powers and for the

‘Not Willing’

“Major powers at present are
not willing to be subservient to an
international organization,” -said
Kleinberg. “They are not ‘willing
to relinquish their ‘power in major

Kleinberg pointed out the
U.N_.’s effectiveness in three

ed agencies and as a. forum for

“The world exists within the

out the U.N. Until the day comes
when major powers of the world
are willing to give up their power
to the U.N., major problems can-

berg added. ,

Gay agreed with Kleinberg. in
that “I cannot deny the eﬂec-
tiveness and utility of the U.N.
in the work of its agencies.” But

- he proclaimed the “vice of con-
struction is in the U.N. itself.”

,Kleinberg added, “A small

jor one. The U.N. can nip many
of these problems in the bud.”

An unabashed conversationalist,
Miss Wagner states that the spirit
of adventure is missing in modern
youth. They shouldn’t play it so
safe.” She explains this lack of
daring in terms of “the stress on

ments when queried as to what
type of complaints about the
distribution course he would
conside valid. “I think that if a
complaint exists, I’ll consider
any type valid. Those complaints
which can demonstrate their va-
lidity in terms of Cabinet sup-
port will receive action ﬁrst.”

The Cabinet has sent out ques-
tionaires to the students calling
for evaluations.

Rated Poor

“A significant majority of those
who responded rated the distribu-
tion courses as generally poor,”
Miss Chagrin said. “Also courses
covering a narrower scope Were
preferred to those covering a
wider scope by almost all those
responding.”

At present a faculty question-
naire is being processed with the
questions corresponding to those
asked on the student question-
naire. It will be sent to the de-
partment heads to be distributed
to those professors who teach
distribution courses.

If the complaint, once received,
has to do with the teaching aspect
of the course, rather than the in-
structor, the instructor will be
made aware of the complaint and
the speciﬁc department will be
requested to do’ something about

ed. If the complaint is about.the

Miss Wagner’s philosophy is to
“give a youth a dime and send
him around the world.” Her ad-
vice to students is: “Never accept

she was_ not very old when her

possible and that his lectures had

nothing to do with the subject of
the course. Dean Martin was in-
formed and the next day the pro-
fessor brought questionnaires to
class.

His lecture the next time was
well organized and he has im-
proved considerably since he
was made aware of the com-‘
plaint, according to his students.

“I heard rumblings,” Dr, Mar-
tin mentioned in regard to the
complaints, “butwhen all you get
are rumblingsit is hard to sort the
irresponsible complaints.

* Get to the Source

“You have toget to the source
— the student body —— in order to
ﬁnd out the responsible com-
plaints. The Liberal Arts Cabinet
can give a lot of service. They
are a responsible and concerned
group. I expect much good to
come out of the Cabinet.”

The Cabinet and Dr.
postulated two basic iterms:

—They would be concerned
with the quality of the course
and the construction. _

—That they would not become
involved in criticism of person-
alities.

“There are some valid com-
plaints that can be made about
the equipment provided for the
course,” Dr. Martin explained,
referring to the fact that com-
plaints might be made regarding
the lecture systems.

“When you use the lecture, you
should use it for a speciﬁc func-
tion that can be performed by a
first class man in that type of
set-up,” he concluded.

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

The ﬁnal verdict is in. The fates of doom havelbeen seal-
ed. The Broadway critics have made their decision on the

Great Experiment and here is the judge’s, ﬁnal decision — “I.
sentence “The Advocate” to six days on Broadway regard-

less of ecsatic approval by the television critics and audi-

ences.”

What seemed to be a wonderful
idea, the fusion of television and
the theatre to produce a common
cultural and entertaining product,
seems i to have gone up in the
smoke emmanating from the pens
of the New York drama critics.
It certainly seemed that from the
opening bell, the play and its idea
were doomed. Robert Noah’s treat-
ment of the Sacco—Vanzetti mar-
tyrdom was supposed to throw

some new light on the 36 year old 1

subject. The critics as early as
1962, when the play’ was preview-
ed in Bucks County, said that if
any new light could be shed on
the case it Wasn’t evident from
the drama they had just seen. And
so in 1962, if the people involved
would have taken the kindly ad-
vice of the prophets of doom, a lot
of time, energy and money could
have been saved and the eventual
acknowledgment of failure would
have been avoided. .-
This didn’t happen. All of the
people connected with “The Ad-
vocate” thought that the drama
had something to say, and they
were vehement in their belief that
the play could still wind up in
New York. .William Hammer-
stein‘ II, the‘ producer, Howard
DaSilva, the director, Noah, the
author, and James Daly, the star,
apparently had some vision in
their sleep which told them that
critics had been.wrong before.

 Why not this time?

The next step in this remarkable
experiment . stemmed from the
offices of Westinghouse Corpora-
tion and added a new insight into
the ideas of presentation never
before attempted. .

It was the contention of West-
inghouse that television could pro-
ﬁt from the world of the theatre
and vice versa. An idea that could
fuse the elements of both great
forces of the mass media. was a
sure-ﬁre method of presenting
theatrical works to the entire

'American public and not just to
those who put ‘up the ten bucks
for two seats in a Brodway the-«

dramatic offering from the pen of
an aspiring American playwright.
The playwright had: to be aspir-
ing to preserve the image of fresh-
ness and originality with which
the entire project was concerned.
Everything was to be new and
novel and anew playwright ﬁt
‘into, this image. He had to be
American because . . . (it is hoped
my readers are not that naive not
to be able to reach conclusions to
the above sentence).

Messers Hammerstein II, ‘Noah,
and Daly were having troublein
raising funds for their Broadway
presentation and discovered the
intentions of the Westinghouse
people late last spring. Apparent-
ly, “The Advocate’-’ had been re-
vamped enough so that it appear-
ed to be a new and more interest-
ing product then when ﬁrst pre-

sented and brought to the atten-
tion of Westinghouse Corp. An
agreement was reached between
the two parties and plans went
ahead for a combined opening
night presentation of the play to
both the television public while at
the same time, it would be pre-
miering. amid the gold and glitter
of Broadway. The date set for
the taped. TV version and the
Broadway opening was October 14
and all details were smoothed out.
Like the man says, the rest is
history. “The Advocate” opened
on Monday and closed on Satur-
day. The television critics of
Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Boston,
Baltimore and Chicago raved
about theishow as it -
appeared on the 24
inch home screens. In a Flash
-Hundreds of phone of ‘"13 Fell
calls from approving
viewers also seemed to spell suc-
cess for the great experiment.
The idea of television and broad-

"way as one looked like a hit.

Until the New York reviews came
out . . . Then it was a Judge
Crater all over again. All ideas
vanished with the words of the
prophets and their prophesies had
ﬁnally come to "light. “The Advo-
cate_” on Broadway was no more.
It should never have even been.

All is not lost, however. Word
has come from TV sources that
the play will be sold to some
ninety syndicated stations for
future viewing and the ﬁnancial
lost will be reversed after renew-
als and world-wide sales. For TV

it was a great success, but for ,

Broadway it was a great'fa-ilure.
There should be much knowledge
g_ained fromthis great experiment.
From all reports it will not be the
last such attempt made. The re-
sources of TV are unlimited and
if combined with the theatre,
there is no telling, of what can be
accomplished.

professor of political science and
the University representative on
the Inter-university Council.

‘- “It enables us to continue‘ at-
tracting graduate students of a
high caliber,” he said, “as well as
maintaining atop faculty.”

The Consortium was formed to
underwrite joint political research
projects and to provide research
training facilities for students and
faculty of member universities.
The project aims to promote the
conducting of research on selected
phases of the political process. It
is essentially a partnership be-
tween the member ‘universities
and the Survey Research Center
of the University of Michigan. ‘

Data Repository

The research center, as head--
quarters for the Consortium, will
act as a data repository and
handle distribution and compila-
tion of the material.

“The volume of political data
becoming available is growing
so rapidly that individual scho-
‘ lars and institutions ﬁnd it diffi-
cult to keep abreast of all the
recent studies,” said Dr. Hol-
bert Carroll, chairman of the
political science department.
“This consortium is an effort to
make raw material of this na-
ture available to many scholars.”

The material available for use
includes: (1) A comparative ﬁve-

toward government and political
aﬁairs — in Italy, West Germany,

on the maters of interfaith mar-

stating that the paper “is no

Editorial: 1:’: The Offer rlmzs Appreciated

_ In the editorial appearing in the October issue of The Pitt News, we
~ stated that the University paid for the Hootenanny production which was
televised at the Field House on September 4-5.
‘ This was a mistake on our part. The University in no way contri-
‘buted money to the production. The entire ﬁnancial responsibility was as-
sumed by'ABC-TV. , I .
_ A member of the University’s Public Relations department remark-
, ed to us thatthe entire outlay of funds by her organizatoin amounted
to ﬁve dollars for cue cards. ' '

However, the fact that the University did not pay for Hootenanny ‘

inno way detracts from our basic premise that the burden of ﬁnancing

7 the Navy telecast should have been shouldered by the University and not

by the students. . ,
Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancellor -for student and general

.. affairs,‘told us that the students didn’t want the University to "pay for the
' venture. He said that Pete Bijur, chairman of the TV committee, never‘

even suggested that anyone but the students should foot the bill.
However, he added that Chancellor Litchﬁeld, Frank Carver, and an

alumni group had agreed to make good any loss which might be suffered‘

by the student. committee.
‘ A1so,«the.letter from Judy Campbell, Public Relations Representa-

H tive, appearing on this page states that “everyone in the administration

_ were most enthusiastic before the beginning about the telecastnand worked
closely with the three students to make it a success.” - * ‘ ! _ .
This is all very nice, but it should be considered in the light of

certain facts which neither Dr. Rankin norAMiss Campbell hasbothered

to’ point out. a A
If we understand the concept of college football correctly, the game

is for the students. Applying this concept to the Navy telecast, one would

think that the primary concern would have been to insure‘ that as many

     

students as possible be permitted to view the contest. Yet, this was not
the case. ’ ,

Simply because the Field House could only sit between 3,000 and
3,500 for this particularevent, Bijur was forced to sell half of his tickets
outside of the University at double the student price in order to make
enough money to cover the cost of the telecast. ‘ '

There are some 5,500 undergraduates at this institution. 1,500 were
able to purchase tickets at the student rate. 4,000 other were, therefore,
unable to View the game unless they, were willing to buy the more expensive
tickets. Even if all of these 4,000 were willing to do this, 2,500 would
still would have had to be turned away. Of course, nothing could be done
about the seating capacity of the Field House. However, something could
have been done about the 1,500 seats which went to outsiders.

Had" the University offered to chip in $1,500, the number of students
attending the viewing could have doubled. «

Even if all the student tickets were not purchased, this would only , ,

prove that even _one dollar is more. than students can afford. At which

" point we are again forced to ask whetlier it is proper for students to have

to pay a-nything at all to watch their ownfootball team‘ in action.

Dr. Rankin was quite correct when he commented‘ that Bijur did 5

not ask the University" to foot’ the bill, but should a person have to ask
for something when the need is so apparent?’ ‘K
Half of the students who could have seen thetelecast did not see it.
The University could have. changed all this. It did not. Claiming that there
was not enough money in the budget for such a" venture is no sound
argument. $1,500 is less than the tuition of three students for one term.
If the students had been considered important, the. money could have
been found. ; -
The students did not ask for support, but the fact that 1,500 of
them did not see the Panthers play Navy should be ._on somebody’s
conscience. ' » ' _

 

   LETTERS To THE EDITOR

  

Editor, The Pitt News:
Your editorial of October 23,
“To Play for the P1ay-by-

Play,”‘is so incorrect and mis-
leading that it is necessary to

set the record straight.

V A Your premise is that because
the University picked up the
tab for “Hootenanny,” it should
do the same for the closed cir-

cuit telecast of the Pitt-Navy -

game. ~

 That might be a valid argu-
ment if the facts were correct.
But the facts are that ABC-
TV paid the costs of the “,Hoot—
enanny” productions and was
billed for any work the Uni-

— versitypdid in preparing for the

shows. _ -

You knew that this -office
handled the arrangements for
“Hootenanny,” and a phone

. call to us would have immedi-

ately given you any facts you
wanted 4- and prevented you
from making a ridiculous error.

As a matter of fact, you seem
to have little memory for what

you have previously . printed, ,

» In a front page story_on Sept-
ember 4, you called attention
.to the fact that ABC‘ ‘spared
no expense in. preparing the
Field House for the shows.

‘ Having erroneously assumed

' that the University footed the

‘ \

bill for “Hootenanny,” you be-
moan the fact, that it won’t do
the same for the Pitt-Navy
game. You neglectthe ‘fact (or
did you even try to ﬁnd out)
that the telecast was under-
written by Chancellor Litch—

partment and Public Relations
—- indeed, everyone in the ad-

ministration —._ were most en-, ‘
thusiastic from" the beginning .

about the ’telecas_t and worked
closely. with the three student
involved to make it a success.

only a couple daylater you are ‘ '

guilty of the same irresponsi-
bility. . ,

The purpose of a newspaper
is to print the facts, yet you

Editor, The Pitt News:

At the last meeting of the
Pitt Young Republicans, held

'~‘onf;oc’tober. 4, we decided. that

we would like to answer Mr.

A James Kleinberg’s irresponsible

c 0 lu m n ‘.‘Ideological Battle”
which appeared in The Pitt
News on September 30. Mr.

Kleinberg h a s 'oversir_npliﬁedc

the issues in order topresent
an on-the-surface attack on the
Republican Party. A

Mr. I Kleinberg: W h a t is
wrong with ideolpgy? and what
do you mean by implying that
Senator Goldwater feels that
“There is an. ideology to de-
fend, namely rural, nineteenth-
century Americanism — and
an ideologyto V-attack, namely
socialism. statism‘,-1 Communism,
and ‘welfa_rism?”1 You .certainly

alike to use the big "and catchy
(words, but you offer no-proof

to- your outlandish,"statements.
Is _it‘defe_ndi_ng rural nineteenth
c e _n tu r y America (whatever

- ‘that is) to present a program
.for,victory over our enemies
. (as Senator Goldwater did in.

his book, Why Not Victory)?

Is it- being .ideological or
rather isn’t Senator Goldwater
"relying on principles — the
principles of freedom and so
on while the so-called center

 of American political life wor-

ries about interest groups? If
so, more power to him (rather
than the less,.if' M. Kleinberg
were distributing it) for our
men would not have fought in
vain in World War‘II.

serious and start writing res-

As an engineering associate, Regis Filtz (B.S.M.E., 1958)
is involved in virtually all facets of telephone communica-
tions for Bell of Pennsylvania. From the design of under-
ground conduit to bridge cables, Regis is an expert.

Much of his reputation came_ about on his first assign-
ment, where his recommendations for the most economical

underground cable resulted in savings estimated at $200,000 ,
‘annually. ’ - ‘

Other assignments have included engineering require-

ements‘ on a -‘variety of communications equipment and

services. He has even taught a course in switching logic.

For Regis, the diversity of assignments has broadened
his engineering knowledge and given him the opportunity
to advance in position and‘ compensation. His authority
in catenary suspensions requires ﬁeld engineers to consult
with him in the design of such spans. '

Regis Filtz, like many young engineers, is impatient
to make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such, restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded-’ than in T. the fast-growing telephone business.

  Panthers Play Give Away With
1   A c elnterceptions, Fumbles Lead to All
Middie Scoring in Crucial Contest 

By BOB SMIZIK _ 'i
ANNAPOLIS —— Statistics show that the Panther gridders gave away the ball six
— times on fumbles and interceptions while losing to Navy here- Saturday, 24-12. Statistics
don’t always tell the whole story, however, for the Panthers gave up much more than the
V ‘    .3.  _ .. V  stat sheet shows.

There is a strong possibility
that the four interceptions and_
two fumbles cost the team: (1)
The Lambert Trophy; (2) Pos-
sibly a ﬁrst and deﬁnitely a sec- 
0nd place in the weekly football ,4,-
ratings; (3) A bowl bid.

It appears Navy has a lock on
the Lambert Trophy, an award
given to the. East’s best team,
since the remainder of its sched-
ule is much softer than Pitt’s.

A Panther win would have
moved them up in the ratings be-
cause second ranked Wisconsin
lost to Ohio State. Top—ranked
Texas squeezed by Rice, 10-6.

A bowl bid is still a long way
off, but now the Pant_h'ers are
second‘ choice to -the selectors as
far as Eastern schools are con-
cerned.‘ There are only four
spots open in the major bowls -
two in the Gator, one. in the
Orange and one in the Cotton.

The rest of the bowl spots are
taken due to the conference tie-
ups. Pitt will not go to the Sugar
_Bowl due to segregation. practices
there. . ~

Saturday’s. game was best
summed up by safetyman Glenn
Lehner who said, i‘We made
enough mistakes to last the sea-
son.”

    

  

,  0b Smizik:  
  StaubachShows
Brilliant F arm

Roger Staubach should be a cinch all-America nom-
ination. Not only is he an exceptionally good football
player, but he has two publicity men working for him.
One is Budd Thalman, who gets paid for telling’ people
about Roger, and the other is Wayne Hardin, who gets
paid for coaching Roger,but who has no qualms about
spreading the word of Staubach’s greatness.

‘ . ’ ‘When asked about the ﬁne

rush the Panthers put on Stau-

bach Staurday, Hardin said,

“Roger is only human and he’s

going to be thrown for losses

sometimes. Hold it!” Hardin-in-
terjected. “I take that back, some-
times I wonder if Roger is human.

The way he plays I doubt it at

times.”

At another point in the
interview, a reporter —- in.ref-

-  ~ - - ‘ erence to the Panther offense
— said to Hardin, “You can’t believe everything you
read in the papers.” A '

Hardin replied, “I believe some of the things I read
in the paper. When they tell me Roger Staubach’s the
greatest ball player in the country, I believerthemf’.

‘ The truth of the matter is that Thalman and Hardin
would have to do little talking about Staubach, because
he speaks for himself with his actions on the ﬁeld.

At 6-feet-2, 195 pounds, Staubach has excellent
size for a quarterback. At running the ball he has ex-

_ cellent ability for a halfback. Dismiss the fact that -
Staubach’s rushing ﬁgure for the _day was a minus
33 yards. This was due to yards lost attempting to,
pass. , - ' .

For when Staubach rian he left the Panthers bewild-
ered. The best example of his shitﬁness came in the
fourth period when the Middies wereon a scoring march.
Staubach swept his right end where he ran into Rick
Leeson. Never one to mingle with the opposition, Stau-
bach threw a few fakes and was by Leeson. Leeson
never moved. He was so befuddled by Staubach’s move-
ments that he was faked into submission. ,

Fourteen completions in 19 attempts is all that need‘
be said of Staubach’s. passing talent.

Thalman and Hardin aren’t the only ones enrap_tur-
ed with the Navy quarterback. ‘ v

“I saw something out there today that I loved,”
said one pro scout. “I’m eating my heart out over
that Staubach. The guy’s got everything you look
for in a pro quarterback,” the scout continued. They
say he’ll make a great Naval officer. He’d also «make.

a heck of a pro quarterback.” , ’

All this and he’s only a junior. Add to this the fact

FRUSTRATED FANS watch dejectedly at the Field House, Satur-

This lit. the frustrated fans’
fuse. “That’s a. great way ‘for the
publicity director to talk,” one
said.

Then, with about ten minutes to

play, the announcer stated: “The

score’s against us, and the clock’s
against us.” This prompted shouts
from the. stands such as, “And
Beano Cook’s against us !”

But the crowning glory was
when Cook stated, “Roger Stau-
bach is probably the greatest
quarterback of all time.”

This evoked a strong reaction
from the Panther fans at the,

. Field House. “I thought he was

our publicity director,” someone
yelled above the booing.
' When the fans left the Field
House, they didn’t talk about
Navy’s line, or their defense, or
Roger Staubach. They talked about

“a great one” but felt “our in-
ability to sustain a drive hurt
us. Every’ time we started to
move a fumble or an intercep-
tion would stop us.”

An end from nearby Home-
stead, Pa., Jim Campbell, also had
a big part in stopping Michelo-
sen’s team. He caught seven pass-
es to tie a Navy record and stood
out on defense all day.

The Panthers didn’t score until
53 minutes
elapsed when Lucas hit Eric
Crabtree with a 39-yard scoring
pass. Seeing that scoring can be
fun, the Panthers came back five
minutes later on a 74-yard pass
from Lucas to Paul Martha to
make the rout, look close.

Biological Laws Non-Existent;

By NANCY DELANEY

, _ There really is no question of
' whether or not biological laws can

be reduced to physical and chem-

' » ical laws, because biological laws

are non—existent, explained Dr. J.
J. C. ‘Smart, visiting professor of
philosophy at Harvard, last Thurs-

, day at a Philosophy of Science

_Lecture.
The Hughes Professor of Philo-
sophy fromithe University of Ade-

laide, Australia, compared the re-

lation biology bears to physics
and chemistry to the relation be-
tween electronics
rather than to the relation be-
tween chemistry (which is reduc-
ible to physics) and physics.

The analogy refers to the struc-

” tures of explanation in biology, he

clariﬁed. Just as electronics is
physics plus wiring diagrams, bio-

logy is physics and chemistry plus

natural history. Biology uses the
laws of the other sciences to gen-
eralize the facts of natural his-
tory.

Making complete universality
and applicability defining char-

acteristics of a law, he claimed

that biological generalizations can
not be classiﬁed as laws because
they admit exceptions and be-
cause they implicitly refer to a
particular location — the earth.

“Biological generalizations are like
the statement ‘All tigers have
stripes;’ but perhaps on another
planet, things like tigers might

. have spots.” V
In addition, the logic and meth-

odology of the biologist is more
akin to that of the technologist

‘ than to that of the fundamental

scientist.

Dr. Smart differentiated be-
tween “extra-theoretical” and “in-
tra-theoretical” use of mathe-
matics, and indicated that the
extra-theoretical use of statistics
in biology does ,not imply that

"some branches ‘of biology consist

of mathematical theories.

He also suggested that in the‘
branch of biology known as psy-
chology, research would be_ more

' advantageous if psycholo g i s t s

would try “to -get down to the
neurons.”

Does a man rlly take unfair advantage of men
when he uses Mennen Skin Bracer?-

Aii depends on why he uses it. V ,

Most men simply think Menthol-iced Skin Bracer is the best
after-shave lotion around. Because it cools rather than burns.
Because it ‘helps heal shaving nicks and scrapes. Because it
helps prevent blemishes.

So who can blame them if Bracer’s crisp, long-lasting aroma
just happens to affect women‘ so remarkably?

Of course, some men may use Mennen Skin Bracer because
