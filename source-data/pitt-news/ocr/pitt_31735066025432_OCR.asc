Denying drug charges, shaking hands
and posing for pictures,’ Democratic
presidential hopeful Jerry Brown rushed
for the doors of David Lawrence Hall an
hour and a half late Thursdayafternoon.

Brown said the charges that he held
marijuana and cocaine parties in his
California home were “unsubstantiated
[and] very vague.” He added, as he entered
the packed ‘ auditorium, there was no
evidence for the charges and, “Our security
people say the opposite.” ,

The former California governor
addressed a crowd of nearly 1,000 in DL’s

auditorium. The crowd, co_nsisting mostly A

of Pitt and Carnegie Mellon students, filled
‘the seats, the stage, the floor and left
standing room only in the back. \
Efforts by Pittsburghers for Brown to rile
the emotion of the crowd were
unsuccessful until Brown entered the

“Let’s do it! Who said students were
inactive? Who said» students didn’t care?
We don’tstop. We don’t give up. We keep
goinggto take this country back,” Brown
yelled as he took the microphone. 4

Brown attacked George Bush and
Congress in ‘a 30-minute speech that
twisted, turned and was full of buzzwords
that have become popular on college

- campuses of the ’90s.

“You know, Bush is the environmental

Bush of making a commercial on a boat in
Boston. Harbor and letting his
environmental action end there.

Rallying to protest crime and show their concerns
for campus safety, nearly 100 students took to the
streets of Oakland for the “Take Back the Night”
march Thursday. -

Candle—carrying students were led by public-
safety escorts and Department of Public Safety
Director William Brennan on a protest walk
through North and South Oakland.

The march, organized by the Student
Government Board Public Safety Committee, was
to increase student awareness about campus
safety and to send a message to the administration
and community that Pitt students are concerned
with security on campus and in the surrounding
area, SGB member Derrick St. Clair said. '

“It’s sending a clear message thatsafety is a real
concern and people need to be aware of it,”
Brennan said. ’

"The students are saying to the administration,
‘Do more for safety; do more for us.’ Even Public
Safety is saying to the administration, "Do
something for us,”’ SGB memberjake Brody said.

V Students said they were successful in making a
statement about safety. .

“It’s one step in the right direction in letting the
community know the students and university
care and are going to do something about crime,”
SGB member Bryan Bender said.

“It made a statement about college kids being
upset about all the crimes on campus,” Pitt
student Amy Erdman said.

According to St. Clair, the march also helped
increase awareness about the need for student
participation in the fight against crime.

“Awareness is the key,” he said.

“All semester we’ve been struggling to get‘
students concerned about safety, and it's finally

"happened. They’ve taken it upon themselves.

Safety is a two—way street,” Brody said. .

Many students expressed a desire to become
more involved with the security issue and said
changes need to take place. A

Guernsey advises Greeks On running a successful rush

By Heather Gahres
Stajf Writer

, General recruitment and publicity were
some of the topics discussed in a seminar on
how to have a successful rush presented to
Pitt's fraternities by Greek Advisor, Bridget
Guernsey.

Guernsey presented the seminar to the
rush chairpersons of the fraternities
Wednesday evening.

Guernsey said one of the most important
things fraternities need to think about during
rush is what type of members they want. “We
never think about our market,” she said.

She said it is important that fraternities
have diverse majors, so there is someone to
appeal to everyone.

She also said that the Greeks were not
capitalizing on a major part ofPitt’s students.

“Eighty percent of Pitt’s Greeks are non-
commuters. We’re rushing mainly on campus,
but the majority of the school is commuters,”
Guernsey said.

Guernsey said that fraternities should also
consider the class break down of their
members: She told the fraternities to
concentrate on freshman, because they will

~ be around to contribute to the fraternity for

at least another four to five years.

The general recruitment of new members
in the Greek system is the responsibility of all
fraternity members, according to Guernsey.
She explained the responsibilities of the
members during rush to the chairpersons.

The rush chairpersOn’s responsibility is
that of a record keeper. “You should keep
track of who’s coming [to the rush events],
how often they’ve come, and [which fraternity
members] they’ve met," Guernsey said.

The rush chairperson should also play an
integral part in making the decision of who
should receive bids, because they will spend
the most time with the rushees.

New initiates should be more responsible
for the recruitment of new members, because

they have classes with more first year students

and have more friends still in high, school,
according to Guernsey.

' The officers’ responsibility during rush is
to try to meet all Of the rushees. “The officers

should be introduced to as many rushees as

possible. It makes the rushees feel important
to meet the officers,” Guernsey said.

Guernsey suggested that the rush
chairpersons use money as a way to motivate
the rest of the fraternity members into helping
with rush. ‘

“Tell your brothers, ‘If we have 10 more
members, we’ll be able to fund our alumni

dinner. Without them, you’ll have to pay,”’
Guernsey said.

She also suggested having incentives for
individuals, such as, an award for most the
contact with the rushees.

She also suggested a group incentive by
setting a goal for the number of new members
the fraternity would want to have.

If the fraternity meets its goal, then the
fraternity would reward itself with a special

dinner.

The fraternities were also told about the
importance of publicity during rush. Guernsey
suggested placing ads in 777ePz'tt News, local
radio stations and posting flyers around
campus listing their rush events.

She also said the fraternities should set up
days to wear their letters and to hang banners
with their letters in residence hall windows,
so the rushees would have a sense of name
identification.

A form of free publicity the fraternities
should take advantage of is home football
games. “Make [the rushees] see all Of your
brothers. Take your standard [which is a sign
with the fraternitiesletters] and get your butts
out on the field,” Guernsey said. I

She also said that the ‘fraternities should
hang banners around the football stadium
before the games.

Fair showcases overseas opportunities

By Tonia Caruso
For T be Pitt News

International experience is the best way to
distinguish yourself from the thousands of
students graduating each year, and it could help
you land a job overseas.

This was the message conveyed to students
attending Saturday’s International Expo in the
William Pitt Union. The expo, sponsored by
Pitt’s Study Abroad Office, featured study, work
and volunteer-abroad opportunities as well as
workshops entitled “How to Get ajob Overseas”
and “Marketing Your International Experience.”

T hirty—one different overseas programs were
represented at the fair, which was open to
students from all Southwestern Pennsylvania
coﬂeges

“Our main goal is to let people know what’s
out there and what they can do,” explained
Victoria Machtay, a graduate intern for the Study
Abroad Office. “We want to let them know it’s
not that difficult to go abroad for a semester. You
cando it for approximately the same price as
Pitt.” ’ '

Dr. Angi Yucas, director of the Study Abroad
Office, deﬁned international experience as “any
time spent outside of the country.”

In her workshop on finding a job overseas,
she discussed the advantages ‘of venturing
abroad. V

“Getting international experience by either
studying, working or just plain traveling is vitally
important,” Yucas explained. “In this country,
we barely have 3 percent of our undergraduates
studying abroad, so those who do are a
distinguished minority.”

Yucas. contended that studying abroad “says

so much” about a person.
“It says a person is someone who has initiative
and is independentand self—sufficient,” she said.

“It truly enhances your resume and you as a total
package.”

While encouraging those who have never
visited abroad to do so, Yucas also had some
frank advice for those who want international
careers.

“The two biggest myths that probably exist
about international careers is that there are many
jobs available in American embassies and there
are many jobs available for translators,” Yucas
said. “In reality this is not really the case, but
there are many, many opportunities that are
beginning to open up. You just have to look for
them."

Yucas explained the best way to make
connections is by studying, traveling and doing
volunteer work overseas. “Just starting out, you
may be fortunate enough to get a job somewhere
abroad, but be prepared for an entry-level
position,” she said. “You have to remember that
the wonderful, exciting, internationalcareer you
want probably won’t present itself to you for
about five years.”

Yucas said that the road may be long, but
many of her students are making progress. “I get
phone calls all summer from graduating seniors
who say things like, ‘I’ve just interviewed with
[General Motors] and we spent a half an hour

‘talking about the fact that I was at Semester at
Sea,’ or ‘They really [focused] on that year I spent

in France,”’ she said. _ -

“I tell everyone who comes into the [Study
Abroad] Office for information to be a cultural
sponge and soak it all in. I tell them to travel and
learn and experience everything they can. One
thing’s for sure; it can never hurt. It can
only enhance and add to a person’s

achievements.”

Business dean cites need

for undergrad program

By Megan Bertino
News Editor

Amid rising costs for higher
education and increased
competitiveness for jobs, students
and faculty have begun to see a
need for an undergraduate
business school at Pitt.

According to H]. Zoffer, dean
of the Katz Graduate School of
Business, Pitt needs an
undergraduate business school
to offer students a wider range of
career options as well as to make

the university more competitive.

Zoffer said the current business
program offered at Pitt is really a
degree in arts and sciences with
some background in management
but, it “doesn’t meet the needs of
students who are seeking more
substantive positions in the
management area.”

Students in the dual major must
adhere to CAS rules and
regulations in regard to the
number of courses that can be
taken outside of the school. This
limits the number of business
credits that can be taken unless
students are willing to remain in
school an extra semester, Zoffer
said. He added that a more
systematic exposure to marketing,
finance, accounting, information
systems and human resources is

necessary in the program.

If students had a more extensive ,

business background, they would
be more competitive in the job
market. “There is non-
competitiveness here built in by
the current system for those who
seek careers in business,” Zoffer
said.

If established, students in the

new business program would ,
concentrate on arts and sciences .

during their first two years and
then concentrate primarily on
business in the second two, Zoffer
said.

He also pointed out that the
undergraduate business degree
program would not be avant-
garde — “virtually all of the 700
colleges in this country that offer
undergraduate business offer an
undergraduate business degree.”

In response to criticism that the
$6—7 million business school will
be too expensive to run, Zoffer.

said much of the funding will f

come from corporate donations.

“The program would generate
millions of dollars for the
university,” Zoffer said, explaining
that corporations have a

propensity to give to universities
from which they do their major
hiring.
Zoffer said by not instituting

Women need to learn to identify date rape, say

By Donna Pesansky
Staff Writer '

With the rape that recently
occurred, many people have
become aware of the problems
with safety on Pitt’s campus. But

‘something many people" don’t

realize is that there is a greater
problem which has been affecting
women for years.

Adding more lights along
walkways, making the van system
more efficient or even increasing

-the number of campus—police

officers won't help the majority
of these victims. Why? Because
only one out of 10 rapes which
occur on a college campus are
stranger rapes. The rest are know
as date or acquaintance rape,
according to BJ. Horn, the
assistant director of the
Pennsylvania Coalition Against

’ Rape.

“The hardest part about date

rape is getting the victims to
come forward because so many
women don’t even realize they
have been raped,” Horn said. He
said that is mostly because
acquaintance rape is common in
dating and romantic situations,
where a women is led to believe
it was her fault or she led the man
on.

According to Horn, date rape is
the interaction that begins
between a man and a woman in
the context of a social event or

gathering and ends with one

participant forcing the other to
participate in sexual activity
against his or her will. Horn said
this kind of rape will happen to
one out of four women during
her college years.

So what can be done about it

here on Pitt’s campus? Mary Ellen
Hiotakis, coordinator of date-rape
programs within the residence
halls, said education and

awareness are the key to
eliminating the problem.
Through education men can
come to realize that “real” men
take no for an answer and that
rape is not sex but a violation of
someone’s well being. Women
can learn how not to get
themselves into compromising
circumstances and to be clear,
honest and consistent about their
sexual desires and limits.
Currently at Pitt there are a few
programs set up to educate
students. The Office of Residence
Life offers a program called
“S.AV.Ed,” Sexual Assault and
Violence Education. Usually there
is a program for men and one for
women in which each group can
discuss their feelings openly. “But
these programs are poorly
attended, and the ones who do
attend often already are familiar
with the problem,” Hiotakis said.
The Freshmen Studies class is

the other program Pitt offers to
educate people about safety on
campus, but that also proves
ineffectual according to Cindy
Hoffmann, a publications
specialists for the College of Arts
and Sciences’ dean’s office and a
Freshmen Studies I instructor. She
said the class is not mandatory
and not all instructors teach a
segment on date rape or public
safety.

In a class setting, people are
too shy to really become involved
in the discussion. This class
doesn’t have much of an impact
anyway “because how can you
change in 50 minutes attitudes

4 people have had all their lives?”

Hoffmann said.

“Something needs to be done;
people have to start getting mad,”
said Holly Chandler, co-president
of the Campus Women’s
Organization. Education is the
only way to make people become

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, April 13, 1992

s center director

aware, and no one’s willing to

step out of bounds or go, beyond.

the point where their hands are

tied. Twenty-five percent of the

women at Pitt are being violated,
and nothing is being done to try
to eliminate this problem.

“We can’t make programs
mandatory,” said Derrick St. Clair,
acting chair of the Student
Government Board Public Safety
Committee, “but we can scare
students into becoming aware.”

St. Clair’s plan is to involve
groups. from all parts of the
campus, such as the Office of
Resident Life, the counseling
center, the Office of Student
Affairs and ‘New Student
Programs, to set up educational
programs for first-year students
during orientation and other
programs throughout the year.
The committee is currently in the
process of publishing a student
handbook on safetyfor the fall.

In Heidi Rosenberg’s Intro to Creative

, encourages_ them to develop a sense of

creative self—expression(

“When some of my students first walk
through the door, they think my class is
just going to be a review of the traditional
poetry and fiction they learned in high
school," Rosenberg said.

Although she acknowledges traditional
writing, she emphasizesthe importance of
modern poetry and fiction in her class. She
introduces her class to modern writers and
their work. 7

Rosenberg said an integral part of her
course is class discussion. She said she
encourages her students to voice their
opinions about notgonly other students’
work‘ but also about their own. Although
some may feel awkward in the beginning,
they soon grow accustomed to speaking
out in her class, she said.

Rosenberg warns that students who

take her course should be prepared to do
a great deal of writing. She said some
students are shocked to find that poems
and stories they work so hard on are often
returned quite marked up. But Rosenberg
said she doesn’t consider their work bad,

“I know it seems harsh, but how can my

students learn if they’re never even in
class?” she said.

Another requirement is that the students
attend at least one “Writer’s Experience”
reading during the semester. This can be
satisfied by students attending a reading
by a visiting writer on campus or going to
a Tuesday night reading at Hemingway’s
cafe on Forbes Avenue. .

“I hope my students learn by the end of
the semester that writing is very hard work
and that they dispense with their
assumptions and become open to try new
things,” she said.

Class of ’92fdcz'ng tougbl times

By Katie Kaminski
Staﬂ‘ Writer

A Upon the successful completion of four or more
years of higher education, the graduating class of
1992 will have reason to celebrate. However, they
will also have reason to worry; finding a job is
becoming increasingly difficult in todays hard
economic times. . -

The current job market is bleak, according to
Professor Mark Pearlman of the economics
department.

With a February unemployment rate of 7.3 percent
and the number of college graduates entering the
labor force slightly higher than the number of job
openings that require four or more years of higher
education, many college graduates may not be able
to enter the occupation of their choice.

Pearlman offered his own suggestions for finding
a first job.

He stressed the importance of graduates knowing
how to express themselves effectively both verbally
and in writing.

“The sad truth is that many cannot do either,”
Pearlman said.

A certain degree of ingenuity is also needed,

Pearlman said.

He said many graduates wait for what they
consider to be a respectable job.

“It’s hard to get a job when none are offered;
when none are offered in your area, look for other
opportunities. Should a college graduate take a job
in a hospital with a large turnover or as a bagger in
a grocery store?” asked Pearl_man. “Neither is what
the graduate thought he spent all of his money for,
but they should get acquainted with the hospital.
It’s more beneficial.”

Taking any job to acquire valuable skills and
using it as a resume builder is preferable to having
no job, Pearlman said. I

Robert Perkoski, interim director of the Career
Placement Center, said seniors should get an early
start and be “fairly aggressive” in their job search.
He also said they should diversify their job—hunting
strategies.

In addition to applying for advertised job openings,
soliciting employment by telephone and sending
resumes to companies without published
advertisements can also be effective, according to
Perkoski who said the Career Placement Center,
located on the second floor of the William Pitt
Union, is also very helpful when looking for
a job.

Students celebrate Hari Raya

By Tonia Caruso
For The Pitt News

Food, smiles and farewell wishes marked the Malaysian
Student Association’s religious celebration yesterday in the
William Pitt Student Union. The 49—member group and the
members’ families met to celebrate the Muslim holiday Hari
Raya, which began on April 4.

“The celebration marks the end of our fasting season,” Pitt
junior Zafura Kassim said. “During the fasting time we don’t eat
anything from dawn until dusk for 30 days. We don’t even drink
water.”

Yesterday’s gathering featured a feast of over 40 Malaysian
dishes and deserts to celebrate what Kassim described as “the
biggest celebration in Malaysia.”

“Hari Raya in Malaysia is like Christmas here,” she said. “It’s
a time to be with your parents and family. Since I am not home,
I'm glad I can be here with the association.” ,

Kassim, a computer science major, has been in the United
States for eight months. She became part of the Malaysian
Student Association shortly after her arrival.

“Everyone who comes here to school from my country is a
part of the student association. We meet throughout the term,”
she said.

“It’s good because we can be among our native people and-
share the same food. It brings us together.”

Aziz Mohamed, president of the Malaysian StudentAssociation
in Pittsburgh, explained that the group is made up of students
from Pitt, Point Park College, Carnegie Mellon and Duquesne
University.

A Brown supporter asks for donations at Thursday's event.

Brown criticizesfund raising

By Megan Bertino
News Editor

Among his criticisms of Congress,
presidential hopefuljerry Brown chastised
U.S. legislatures for raising their pay from
$89,000 a year to $130,000.

“They were poor at $89,000,” he said.
“The reason they thought they were poor
was because they hang out with people 10
times richer than them.”

A Brown heartily attacked lawmakers for
taking campaign funds from wealthy
Americans and big businesses. He said the

wealthy class controls both the Republican
and Democratic party.

“[We have] one, single, incumbent party
of indifference.”

"Brown said that for legislatures to launch
major campaigns every two years, they
must raise $10,000 every day they are in
office. In order to do so, he said, they must
associate with wealthy people who are
willing to help finance their campaigns.

He said lawmakers often hold fund-
raising dinners. “I ought to know. I went
to more of them than Clinton, probably,”

See Funds, page 9 ‘

 

Brown

Continued from page 1

pointed out that since Russia is having
financial difficulties, Germany lends it
the money to pay its soldiers.

Brown said the United States has
30,000 troops in Japan “so they can get
their Toyotas over here faster.”

He noted thatjapan, England, France,
Germany and Italy combined have a
smaller defense budget than the United
States.

But Brown’s real criticism of/\merican
government was about Congress. He
accused Congress of moving sluggishly
on issues of health care and education
but acting quickly in other mat_ters,
particularly the invasion of Panama two
years ago and the rush put on a bill
allowing American factories to move to
Mexico, both of which Brown felt were
unhealthy for America.

“Try to imagine if someone moved
[Congress] to Tijuana and paid them
$13,000 a year and got the same output,”
he said.

Brown said cities are dying and the
United States is having a medical-care
crisis, but Congress doesn’t"even debate

- such issues. While other issues, such as

their recent pay raise, are “handled
quickly and with discretion. If [Con gressl
wants something, they can make it
happen,” he said. 3

Brown asked Pennsylvanians where
was the national health care Sen. Harris
Wofford promised.

He said national health care was
stuck somewhere in Congress. He
doubted the urgency with which
Congress was pursuing such a bill..

“The Congress and the president have
la health—care system], but 40 million

Americans don’t have one. Health care
in not a commodity to be played with
for profit. It is the right of every American
citizen,” he said. '

When someone from the audience
yelled, “When’s the last time you paid a
doctor bill?” Brown, not missing a beat,
responded, “The last time I went to the
doctor.

Brown described his “We the People”/
”Take Back America” campaign as “a
movement about grassroots people
taking back their country.”

He said Americans need to “generate
moral energy to dedicate this country to
change.” He said that the United States
“lacks the political motivation and
institutional press to stop the gridlock
lin Congressl.”

“We’d like you to be a part of it. We

won’t let you down. We will win not for 3

me but for you,” Brown said. He
promised to go to Washington as a
lobbyist for the people of America:
Brown’s supporters showed up with
signs that read “Cutting AIDS Education

is Murder” and ‘TPWAS [People With I.
AIDS] Get the Short End of the Stick” to

remind Brown that AIDS funding,
education and research is important to
many Americans.

“I’m supporting him because his stance
on AIDS is the best of any candidate,”
Pitt student Matt Kittredge said.

Pitt economics professor Bob Snyder
said, “Jerry Brown stands for change in
the system. [He has] no big—money
campaign  [I-Iel lets people make
decisions for them.”

Pitt student Don Short said, ‘‘I don’t

support him. I just came to hear what he
has to say.”

there are currently 5,000

A similar view was

he said.

Brown made fun of such fund-raisers,
saying sherbet is served in the middle of
the meal, “only they don’t call it sherbet;
they call it sorbet." '_

Brown accused those lawmakers of
quietly succumbing to the pressure of

7 those financing their campaigns. “It’s very

hard to eat sorbet and pound the table.”

Such fund-raisers leave candidates .

“seriously compromised from the frrst day
[they] started running,” he said.
In an effort to combat this problem,

Brown hasrestablished an 800 number fOI"_

supporters to phone in pledges for his
campaign. He said he will only accept
pledges of $100 or less.

“How many people in this room have

the crowd. When no one raised their

hand, Brown» said a smart politician’

wouldn’t bother with such a rally because
students have no money to give.

changed that. “The media laughed and

Good Friday is a Christian
holiday. Last April the U.S. Ninth
Circuit Court ruled 2 to 1, in
Cammacle 12. ll’/atbee, that official

"recognition of the holy day did
not violate the federal constitu-

 

tional separation of church and

state. According to Americans‘

United for the Separation of’

Church and State, 11' states offi-
cially observe Good Friday.

Writing for the majority, Judge
Diarmuid O’Scannlian observed
that even if Good Friday had a
religious purpose, it novlonger
does: “The Good Friday holiday
has become a popular shopping
day in Hawaii, and businesses
have benefitted from the three-
day weekend created as a result
of the holiday.”

The challenge stemmed from a
devout Roman Catholic parochial-
school teacher who found gov-

(not the lower classes that work
in theservice industry), govern-
ment involvement is offensive.
Dissenting Judge D.W. Nelson
strongly objected to the majority
opinion. He wrote, “In this case
the legislature sends the message
to non-‘Christians that it finds Good
Friday, and thus Christianity, to
be a religion worth honoring,
while their religion or non-religion
is not of equal importance. In

fact, the government proimotesi

» Western Christians above Eastern

Christians, whose Easter and Good

Friday almost always fall on dif-

ferent dates.”
Nelson is right to point o'_u_t_tl'iat
the official recognition of the holy

day puts one religious beliefat  ‘
higher level than another. ‘Nelson ‘

insisted Good Friday is

he argued that these twohglidays. ,

In our pluralist society, culvtuire

holidays. Jewish’ holy days, such: J:

Searching for ‘cures’ ignores treatment, prevention

“Modern scientiﬁc medicine”
makes many extravagant claims.
For example, it claims that it can
“save lives.” I’d like to know how
the number of lives “saved” by a
certain procedure is determined.
Honesty in _advertising should
prevent the use of vague terms
only to arouse an emotional re-

sponse but which have no basis _

in fact.

Another claim is that medicine
can ‘cure’ disease. Does ‘curing’
disease simply mean treating
symptoms and removing organs
from the body?

Vast resources of money and
human energy are expended in
searching for ‘cures.’ By contrast,
little effort is devoted to preven-
tion.

The medical idea of prevention

seems confined to vaccination
and “immunization” programs,
despite the fact that vaccines had

5

Letters

little to do with the decline of the
diseases for which they were
given. For example, smallpox
started to decline in England long
before compulsory smallpox vac-
cinations were introduced. Many
other diseases for which there

were no vaccines also declined
and disappeared.
Decline in mortality was chieﬂy

due to public-health measures‘

(better housing, better food,
cleaner water, sanitation), short-
ening of thework week and
abolishment of child labor.
Laboratory workers are glori-
fied and lavished with the best
equipment that money can buy.

In spite of this diseases continue
to multiply because social and
economic causes of disease are
overlooked.

Instead of searching for ‘cures,’ ‘
is it not more logical and more I

rational to study causes and ef-
fects?

Pitt’s football reputation still
intact, despite recent decline

0 Last Saturday evening at a
fellow colleague’s humble
abode, I found myself
immersed in a highly civil
discussion  OK, a raucous,
roundhouse battle of verbal
warfare  about Pitt football
and its reputation as a national
power: Does it still have one?
The debate started when I
remarked on the depleted
reputation of Pitt football by
noting that the Blue—Gold game
drew a throng of 200 people,
while real national powers like
Ohio State, Oklahoma and
Nebraska have crowds of
55,000+ for their spring games.

The “anti-Pitt prominence”
man of the argument, a fellow
lackey identiﬁed anonymously‘
as “George,” noted that Pitt’s
rep in the south and west is in

— -such decline that southern and
midwest schools have little fear
of the alleged “Beast of the
East.” “George” even went so
far as to say that in a state like
Florida, fans would have
trouble identifying where Dan
Marino went to college.

While I personally think that
line of thinking is a bit extreme,
it holds some merit. In the last

A 15 years Pitt players have
earned more accolades for their
pro careers than their years at
Pitt. Many football gurus
nationwide think, for example,
of the New Orleans Saints when

you mention Rickey Jackson
and “Minnesota Vikings” when
Chris Doleman’s name comes

up.

Brian
Gallagher

The point is: Pro performances
by Pitt alums don’t really help
the reputation of their former
schools, and Pitt’s lame fan
support and on-ﬁeld play the
last decade has rendered Panther
Power as down and out and on-
par with the likes of West
Virginia.

This tone of anti-Pitt ruffled
the feathers of the “pro-Pitt
prominence” man, who l’ll call
“Matt.” “Matt” fumed that Pitt
still has a solid, national-level
rep for many reasons, including
the fact that college fans still
remember the ’76 national
championship_ and Jackie
Sherill’s five—year run of
dominance.

But “Matt’s” "strongest
argument — one I totally agree
with —— was that eastern

football’s decline the past 10-12
years-has left Pitt among the few
schools people can still identify
as having a good program. His
contention was that, after Penn
State, fans in Arizona or Utah
think “Pitt” when it comes to the

best college football teams in
the east. And because of that
Pitt has remained a respected
national program.

So where does that leave
Pitt? Simple. ‘

As I see it, Pitt has never

been near the level of a USC,.

Ohio State or Notre Dame (200
fannies at a spring game? Can
you say “embarrassment?”), but
it does have some respect
around the nation — more
than it deserves for its porous
past decade — mostly because
the east has been so bad.
Someone has to carry the torch
as an eastern power. That
doesn't mean that the
Oklahomas and Hawaiis will
give a rat’s ass about them, but
it does give them more clout
than better schools in the
southeast because of the weak
competition around them. At
least for now, as much as they
probably don’t deserve it, Pitt
is somehow still it.

that are playoff—bound and what
could have happened if the strike
never ended.

Hockey," perhaps more than
any other sport, is a game built
on momentum. Momentum can
carry a team through a game or
through a series of games. This
was never more evident than
during the Campbell Conference
playoffs last season. The
Minnesota North Stars got into a
hot streak near the end of the
season, and that incredible
momentum helped a below-
average team beat the Nos. 1 and

2 regular—season finishers as well

as defending Stanley Cup champs
Edmonton en route to the Cup
Finals. Now after a 10-day layoff,
the winning momentum of several

teams is negated. This means that

the Penguins will have tobasically . ' 

start from scratch after compiling

nine straight home wins before , . 

the strike went into effect. This
shift in momentum might affect
the Pens’ performance in the
playoffs.

Then again, let’s consider the

potentially positive aspects of this .

10-day layoff. For instance, recall
that not long before the strike
began, rightwingers Rick Tocchet
and Joe Mullen suffered injuries
that sidelined them for several
games. Tocchetsuffered a cracked
jaw, which kept him inactive for
a few games before he ﬁnally
returned, donning a protective
face shield. Mullen suffered a
serious hip injury in a game
against the Detroit Red Wings
just before the strike, and he

probably won’t be activated for a, ‘V
few more days. Still, the long wait

has certainly helped to speed up
the healing process of these two
vital elements in the Penguins’
attack. Similarly, the 10-day rest
probably did a world of good for
Mario Lemieux’s aching back. 9

could ,

  

It has been two decades since
any team has accomplished what
the Duke Blue Devils did in 1992:
-Repeat.

The choral refrain heard all
season — “‘Nobody repeats” —

4  grew to its height in March, but it

will now have to cease for a long
while. Duke deﬁed the odds,
major injuries and a brutal

2 ~, schedule--allthe while gasping
, for a breather under extreme
. pressure. To merely call Duke a

great team or a special team does
it no justice. The team was much
more than that, surviving more
adversity than one team could
expect to handle. 1
The dawning of this seaso

produced murmuring that the
irrepressible bunch from Durham
could win it again, but doubters
cropped up everywhere. “If
Georgetown could never repeat

I and UNLV didn’t, there’s no way

Duke can,” was interesting and
safe logic at the time, but it failed
to recognize the intangibles this
team had: things like a fiery
attitude, heart, desire, closeness
and the refusal to accept anything
less than the best.

As overstated as it is, the fact
remains that Duke won because
it persevered and it was resilient.
Coach K’s crew not only repeated,
but it did it in an age where parity
is the rule.

The talent pool is divided in a
zillion‘ directions, and the
tournament committee stuffs its
brackets with 64 clubs. What’s
more, Duke never played at full

strength after late January. It ran
the gamut, No.1 from the opening
of practice in November to the
final horn Monday night.

Mike Krzyzewski’s Dookies are
the first team to repeat since the
UCLA dynasty back in 1973.
There’s that word again, the “D-
word.” Many have been reluctant
to pull it out and dust it off, for
fear that Bill Walton and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar would come to their

houses, charge them with

blasphemy and strike them down.
All season long Krzyzewski and
his players answered questions
with a programmed response:
They were not defending a title;
they were attempting to win this
title in ’92.

Entering Minneapolis and their
most rugged test, Christian
Laettner stated nonchalantly, “I
have a bad memory. I can't
remember what happened last
year”

This was the attitude that stuck
all season long. Late December
saw the Devils travel to Ann
Arbor as the gracious visitors at
Michigan’s coming out party, and
they left with an 88-85 overtime
win. January brought the ACC
wars, and, finally, a bit of
adversity. A‘ four—game road trip
began with arch-rival North
Carolina, then LSU, Georgia Tech
and N .C. State — not exactly fun.
Bobby Hurley fractured a bone
in his foot during Duke’s loss to
Carolina and missed ﬁve games.
Grant Hill suffered a severe ankle

sprain and missed three games.

Rob
Pugliese

Both of these players found
themselves recuperating just at
the time of year when most teams
are running on all cylinders. But
Duke always found a way to win.

There was the 19-point deficit
at Clemson, a night on which
Krzyzewski pulled his starters to
watch while the second unit
turned the tide. This win revealed
the draining toll that a marked
team suffered.

The pressure mounted,
weighing heavily on a tired
champion. At a team meeting,
Brian Davis told his mates that
they weren’t having fun anymore.
Following the dramatic Clemson
comeback, a tough home win
over Maryland and a loss at Wake
Forest, Krzyzewski questioned the
desire of his warriors. Davis raised
his game to the next level, scoring
30 against the T erps. But the most
telling moment of the regular
season came on March 1, when

Duke —— minus Hill — went to‘

Pauley Pavilion and squeezed the
life out of a heartless UCLA club.
Davis played huge, while Laettner
and Hurley again demonstrated
the true meaning of clutch. Hill
returned for the season ﬁnale,
and Duke gained revenge on the
Tar Heels. The ACC Tournament
saw the Devils perform like a
machine, crushing Tech and

demolishing Carolina for the title.
Before the NCAAS, critics cried
Duke had an easy road to
Minneapolis.
They underestimated the

strenuous pressure and the fact

that every team Duke faced was
sky—high and primed to play its
best game. Campbell was the
only cupcake. Iowa and Seton
Hall were dangerous teams. The
war against Kentucky will live
forever in the memories and
hearts of fans everywhere.
Skeptics nipped at Duke’s heels
with each passing game, finding
a reason why this team or that
team could be the one to dethrone
them.

A massive anti-Duke
bandwagon gained momentum,
a sure Sign that this team was
more than just a cut above the
rest. People just waited for them
Blue Devils to fall on their faces.
When "there’s that many people
salivating at the slightest chance
of a loss, it defines the real stature
Duke has built. Patrick Ewing’s
Georgetown teams and UNLV’s
great teams were talked about in
the Same light until they failed to
repeat, but they were never as
hated as Duke.

Krzyzewski’s System is: the
reason why Duke contends every
year. He doesn't get one monster
recruiting class like Michigan
landed this year or Carolina last
year, but he recruits three or four
topplayers each season to ﬁll
necessary roles. When Duke

’ seniors move on, others inevitably

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April 13, 1992 V

 Duke joins UCLA as true basketball dynasty

step up. Laettner and Davis are
done at Duke, so the torch will
pass to Cherokee Parks and
Antonio Lang. Hurley and the
Hills will step up, for it is their
tearn now. Krzyzewski has
reinforcement on the way in
incoming shooting guard Chris
Collins and forward Tony Moore.

The battle-scarred Devils
outlasted the odds, the injuries
and the bullseyes that marked
their heads for each game. They
have reached a level all their
own.

Back-to—back national
championships, five straight ﬁnal
fours and six in seven seasons. In
those seven years, Krzyzewski
and his clubs have racked up a
record of 212-45 (.825). His 33-7
tourney record ties him withjohn
Wooden’s .825 lifetime winning
percentage inthe postseason. _

Now Duke is the model
program with the elite coach in
the business. Stop and think what
Duke has accomplished in these
earlyvyears of the Mike Krzyzewski
era. No, it’s not 10 titles in 12
years or 88 consecutive victories,
but Duke has far and away
surpassed what any other team in
the last 20 years has done. In
1992, it is time to correctly classify
what Krzyzewski . and 1 his
unrelenting teams have
accomplished. '

There are now two college-
basketball dynasties. Duke is
there, a true dynasty, and yet you
can sense that Coach K. has only
just begun.

scrimmaging. In addition to
quarterback Alex Van Pelt, who
is missing all of spring practice
after elbow surgery, quite a few
other starters did not play.

Tom Tumulty held out due to a
nagging shoulder problem. Lex
Perkins also has a shoulder
problem and Hackett said he
didn’t want him out there for an
afternoon after a night practice.
Wide receiver ChadAskew pulled
his hamstring Friday night.
Hackett called that disappointing
since Askew had run the fastest
40-yard dash of the receivers this
spring — 4.4 seconds. Hackett
listed defensive tackle Torn
Barndt’s broken arm_as the only
significant injury of the spring.

Among those who did play
were some players making

switches to new positions. The
most notable was senior Bobby
Boykin making the move to
fullback. He did not carry the ball
but caught two passes for 58
yards. Boykin joins senior Carl
Hagins, sophomore Vince
Williams and walk—on
sophomores Obe Roundtree and
Maurice Williams, in trying to
solidify the fullback position.

“[Boykinl got off to a late start,
but he has made the transition,
especially from an emotional
standpoint,” Hackett said. “I am
pleased with the blocking and
receiving.”

Hackett pointed to the players
on the defensive side of the ball
when talking about who was
impressive, especially linebackers
Hayes Clark (two tackles, one for
a loss) and Tony Reardon (two

interceptions), and defensive
lineman Mike Halapin. Defensive
back Anthony Dorsett was also
impressive.

The offense was less
impressive. It was apparent that
the team that played on Saturday
looked very different from the
one that will play, in the fall.
Hackett seemed less than pleased
with an offense he said, that “just
sputtered and sputtered.”

The running game and passing
game were both ineffective with
the receivers dropping passes
being the most glaring problem.

Actually the alumni game was
far more entertaining. Big stars
such as Dorsett, Marino and
Jackson were not on the field, but
some quality players showed up.
Quarterback John Cummings,
who played from 1981 to 1985,,

was the star with a one—yard
touchdown ' run and two
touchdown passes. Wide receiver
Bill Osborn (1985-88) had a big
game catching both scoring strikes
including an impressive catch in
the back of the end zone to make
the score 20-13 for the blue team,
which held up as the final.
Dave Havern (1968-71) threw
two scoring passes for the Gold
team, including a 70 yarder to
Bruce Murphy. The game also
included two long kick returns
for each team. Doug Hetzler
(1986-90) followed Osborn’s first
score with a return to the Blue 39
and Don Smith (1977-81)
followed a Gold touchdown with
a 60-yard return of his own.
The game also included some
moments that looked like
something from a Sunday-

afternoon pick-up game in the

_ park. An attempted trick play by _'  .;
the Goldgended up as a 25-yard '

loss as quarterback D. J.

Cavanaugh (1980-83) tried to

make a move and landed on his
butt. The teams ran some
designed pitches on some of the

kick—offs, but they had nothing .

on the last play of the game.

Chuck Scales (1983-86) picked 
off a Blue-team pass in ‘ gold »

territory. Six Gold-team pitches

and a lot of running later, the ’

game ended
The weekend_may or may not
have been a success when it

comes to bringing together the"

past and present of Pitt football,
and maybe it will be better as
Hackett suggests, but maybe they
should try to include the fans _in
the tradition. I f '

Up for grabs: MVP, Rookie and
Coach‘ of the Year and playoff

picks.

MVP: Pugs’ pick - Clyde
Drexler, Portland: “He never gets
the full respect he deserves. He’s
a leader, a winner, and holds that
team together. Clyde’s the glue of
the Trailblazers.”

BG’s pick — Michael Jordan,
“Da Bullsl”: An obvious, safe
choice? Yes. The only choice? Of
course. As much as he breaks my
heart every year (I’m a Cav fan),
I can’t'l'deny that he is more
important to his team that any
other individual player to his
respective team.

They have anotherrmonster *

masher in Mr. Pippen, but MJ is
hard to handle and better than
the rest.

Rookie of theYear: Pugs’ pick

- Larry Johnson, Charlottei “I said‘

last March that L] wouldbe better
than [Dikembe] ‘Mutumbo or
[Billy] Owens, and I was right.
Billy Owens will never be the
player the caliber of Grand Ma-
Ma. Never! He’s the man!”

BG’s pick: -Larry Johnson,
Charlotte: Unlike my pal, Pug—to—,
the—liese, I had serious doubts
about Larry “Rebel.” I thought he
was too small and lacked the
shooting touch. I think not
anymore! LJ is Baby-Chas Barkley,

and he has displayed the heart of I

a future NBA MVP andchampionl
Billy O will be great, but for the
903 boys, it’s LJ to the market, LJ
home and LJ to thetop of the
NBA!

Coach of the year: Pugs’ pick
- Don Nelson, Golden State: “He
drafted well and molded a

perimeter club into a legitimate ’

title threat.”

BG’s pick — Lenny Wilkens:
He’s gotten three legitimate stars
and a company of mediocre role
players to play title—contending
hoops all year.

Playoff picks: Pugs’ outlook -
“In the East, whoever plays
Indiana is in for a tough series.
Reggie Miller and Chuck Person
are tough when they want to be,
and Michael-Williarns is exciting!
If the Cavs can survive Indiana —
which they probably will -—— they’ll
dust a dangerous but inconsistent
Knick club that I felt would really
raise their game a notch.

“The Bulls will destroy Atlanta
or whoever they meet in Round

’ 1, but Detroit will take them to six _
games (Round.2) before bowing.

Unfortunately in the conference
ﬁnal, the Bulls will beat the Cavs.”

\ will be a war!

Golden State is no fluke, but
they can’t take out either the
Blazers or Jazz. San Antonio will
fold, and Phoenix is like the
Knicks — they could explode,
could fizzle. As for upstarts, the
LA Clippers will make a good
showing, and Seattle is a team
you don’t want to face. They’ll
take someone to Game Sin Round

Western final: “Portland over
Utah in seven.” -

NBA champs: “Portland over
Bulls in seven. No repeat!”

BG’s outlook - The East has

three contenders, ﬁve pretenders.

Forget the Knicks and Celts. Too
immature and old, respectively.

Indy could scare but won’t. If
Detroit can pound the Bulls in
Round 2, the Cavs can beat MJ in
the finals. Don’t bet on it. Bulls

over Mark and the Cleveland Cavs

in six games.

The West is worth watching in

the early rounds, especially if
Clyde is somehow missing.
Portland needs Kevin Duckworth
to make it to the finals, and they’ll-
get him.

exclusive television contract with
NBC as an example.

“[Notre Dame’s weekly TV
visibility] produces an uneven
playing field,” Knoles said. “The
playing field is produced by a
private contract between the
university and a broadcasting
company that produces huge
proﬁts for that university. The
rest of the member institutions
cannot generate those kinds of
dollars.

“In pursuit of the almighty
dollar, we have already defeated
the purpose for why the NCAA
even exists, and we are only
going to see more of that in the
coming years,” Knoles said.
“Unfortunately the development
of athletics has come on the heels
of the big bucks that has followed
the televising of football and
basketball. The popularization of
college sports through those
means has created an animal that
is dying a very painful death."

Pitt’s women’s track head coach

‘Steve Lewis echoed Knoles’

concerns about the corrupting
inﬂuence money has had on
NCAA athletics.

“What causes the big—revenue

‘sports to get out of hand is, in

fact, revenue,” Lewis said. “With
the money comes the“ pressure
[to win], and everybody tries to
finda way to cut corners — every
corner that they can. Money has
never been an incentive of track

. and field.

“It is not fair. The big people
with the money are the ones who
have committed the major
crimes,” he said,

“The NCAA is trying to handcu ff
them, but they are still going to

be on top because they still have
the money. Everyone else gets
handcuffed, too, but they never
had any money in the first place.

“We have to protect our
Olympic sports because those
are the places where you have
the true attitude about athletics
and school. The rest is somewhat
out of hand.”

Lewis said that the NCAA has a
problem with its overall
perception of collegiate sports.‘

He said that when NCAA sees
all sports through the eyes
of football and basketball, it
clouds its judgement when it
comes to enacting broad
legislation. A

He said he also feels that
priorities should be changed at
the university level as well, citing
his six track scholarships to the
football teams’ hundred.

Despite the apparent disparity
in scholarship priorities, Lewis
said he is confident that Pitt's

new administration is on the right .

track.

Of course,'the universities alone
do not control scholarship
distribution.

The governors at this year’s
NCAA convention decreed that
scholarships for swimming should
be reduced from 11 to 9.9. That
means that Knoles has to stretch
9.9 scholarships over 30 athletes,
and he said he sees this legislation
as unfair to large—team sports like
swimming. 

“[This new rule]  means our
squads have to besmaller,” Knoles
said. “Now fewer people can
participate in that whole
experience that we are trying to
promote, and I think we are
missing the boat. We are going to

be hurting a lot of kids by going
to smaller and smaller numbers.”

A_nother new NCAA rule limits
the number of team members a
coach can train during the summer
to five.

Knoles'said that once again the
NCAA is hurting the large-team,
Olympic sports.

“We have 14 individual events
and five relays that we have to
worry about, and we can't do that
with. only five people,” Knoles
said. “We all know it is a basketball
rule. Here again we [are] stuck in
the old, ‘It applies to basketball;
therefore it applies to swimming’

‘type of reasoning. Should

basketball rules limiting the

number of people you can coach a
to five be something you have- to V
control in swimming? I don’t think 

[the NCAAI’ has the right to tell
local swimmers where they can

and cannot‘train."’  V ~ -p
Knoles said he also feelstha

the NCAA is a ﬁnancial failure,
and as proof he cited his trip to
Indianapolis for the NCAA

swimming championships.

The NCAA paid airfare and
hotel expenses for Knoles and
one of his athletes to produce a
free clinic for S00 swimmers and
divers.

After giving him some clothing
as a souvenir, the NCAA ﬂew
them back to Pittsburgh. Two
days later, they were flown back
to Indianapolis for the
championship“ meet.

“I find it almost humorous
because the swimming
committee is talking about cost
reductions. That money could
have been put towards getting
20 or 30 more athletes in the

" championship, meet.”

The -problems non-revenue
sports have trying to exist in a

, revenue-focused sports world do
"not lie; entirely‘ on the broad,

NCAA level. Knoles agreed with

Lewis that rnuchcan bedone on -

philosophical at the university
level,” Knoles said. “In the ideal
situation, all the sports at the
university would be funded with
adequate money. The athletic and
academic world would mesh to
produce a Renaissance human
that would come out of the
experience as a better person
and contribute to society. Well,
that is not how life is.

“We [as NCAA member
institutions] have to bear some of
the responsibility as to why the
NCAA is not being more
successful,” he said.

“The college presidents have
to understand the situation on
the grassroots level of athletics. I
think we are doing that very well
here at Pitt, but I don’t think the
rest of the nation is up with us.
. “How do we promote and
expand our sports and still be
successful financially?” Knoles
asked. “It is a question that
Chancellor O’Connor has to ask.
It is a question that Oval Jaynes
has to ask, and I think it is a
question that all coaches have to

to have to deal with those
dilemmas, and I don’tknow if we

Park errors. In the bottom of the
sixth they exploded for four more
runs. After a walk to Reese, Pitt
put together four consecutive
singles. Singles by Lardo, catcher
Jerry Berteotti, Henne and Tyler
gave the Panthers a comfortable
10—3 lead.

With Rau getting tired, Jackson
replaced him with first—year
pitcher Jamie Goettler. After a
walk and a fly out, Pioneer third
baseman Bob Kircher drilled a
two-run homer to cut Pitt’s lead
to five.

Goettler then let up a single
and another walk before Brett
Canimore connected with a
Goettler fastball that sailed over
the left-ﬁeld fence. The Panthers

Schneider

once comfortable lead was now
down to two runs.

Goettler was then abruptly
pulled and reliever Carl Vollmar
retired the last batter to stymie
the Pioneer rally.

“Steve [Raul did a real good job
for us," Jackson said. “He got a
little tired in the ﬁfth inning and
that is why he came out,” Jackson
said of his decision to pull his
starting pitcher in favor of
Goettler, who was hit badly and
relieved by Vollmar.

Leading Point Park with the
stick was Kircher and Canimore.
Kircher had a two-run home run
while Canimore was 5-for-3 with
a three—run home run and four
RBI’s.

In game two, the Panthers again

got on the scoreboard first. In the
bottom of the second, Point Park
pitcher Bob Kircher walked two
batters before Henne singled in a
run. Henne was followed by two
Kircher mistakes. Kircher ﬁrst hit
Cerere with a pitch that scoreda
run and then he promptly threw
a wild pitch that allowed the
Panthers to cross the plate again.
To make Kircher’s horrid second
inning worse, Berteotti rapped a
two-run single to make the score
5-0.

Pitt continued to score in the
fourth inning. With three walks
in a row, Pioneer reliever Mike
Padgett could find no help from
the Panthers. Berteotti drove in a
run on a fielders choice and Tyler
picked two more RBI’s with a

two—out single, extending the
Panthers lead to 8-0.

Having a 8-0, cushion, Pitt
starting pitcher Gregg Mrochko
was pitching almost effortlessly,
keeping the Point Park. hitters
guessing and only giving up two
hits in the first six innings.

‘The Panthers scored two more
runs in the fifth and held a 10-0
lead going into the seventh and
final inning. With Mrochko
showing signs of fatigue, Point
Park rallied again. This time Pitt
was held to five runs, as a tired
Mrochko picked up the win and
senior Fred Iriti came in to get the
last out and pick up the save.

The win raised the Panthers
overall record to 16-10. This 16th
win let the Panthers surpass last

year's win total of 15. Having a
little less than half the season to
go, Pitt should easily break the
20—game win barrier. V
Coach Jackson is optimistic
about the rest of the season, but
he knows Pitt can play better and
needs to play more consistent.
“We should hit better,” Jackson
said. “I know the Providence
games were not a fluke [Pitt had

39 hits in its three-game series 

with Providencel.’’ -
“We need to be more consistent
in our overall play,” Jackson said.
“That is what were striving for.”
The Panthers play Point Park
again tomorrow in another double

. header between these two cross-gg

town rivals. The game is at Trees
Field starting at 1 p.m.

Several teams that have had
banner years were in serious
threat of having their seasons cut
short. Two teams in particular are
the Vancouver Canucks and the

the Hart (Most Valuable Player)
Trophy. Ranger fans haven’tbeen
this excited about their team since
1941 -— the last time the Rangers
won the Stanley Cup. To have
some idea of how long a period
of time this is, try to imagine the
last time the Cleveland Indians
won the World Series  then go

back about seven years.

The Rangers have had several
good teams before, but they have
always faltered in the playoffs.

This Ranger team has a serious _ '

chance to win the Cup, and if its
season was cut short by the strike,
we may have never known how
good they really are.
