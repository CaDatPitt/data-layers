School of
Education
implements
5-year plan

By Jonathan Berr
For The Pitt News

The School of Education. has
implemented a program that will
add one year of instruction
toward earning a degree in edu-
cation. .

Thomas J. La Belle, dean of the
school, said he hopes the new
program will help meet the new
demands placed on teachers.

”I think it's a good time to be
considering education as a pos-
sible career,” La Belle said. ”Peo-
ple are more concerned with
education and are more con— ’ '
cerned with the people dealing
with it.”

The new program will take ef-
fect in 1987, requiring five years
to complete the education
degree. A student will have to ob
tain a bachelor's degree before
transferring to the School of Edu— _
cation. Health and physical edu-
cation will remain four—year*
programs. ,

Clean water decision pending

By David Goeller

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Reagan faces a
major spending defeat this week if Congress, as ex-
pected, overrides his second veto in three months
of popular $20 billion clean—_water legislation.

Nobody, least of all the president, will be sur-
prised by the pending House and Senate votes over
an aid-to-the-states issue that Reagan says is the ”first
great battle of the (budget) deficit in the 100th
Congress.” '

”I know this veto is going to be overridden,” he
said Fridayat a ceremony that contrasted markedly
with the quiet pocket—veto’he used last Nov. 6 to
scuttle an identical bill ‘after Congress had left town
and was unable to take override votes.

There is one element of suspense this week on
Capitol Hill: Will the House follow the lead of the
Senate and reject a proposal to add $12,100 to the
annual $77,400 congressional salary?

Unless the House rejects them by midnight Tues-
day, the raises, recommended by Reagan, are auto-
matic for lawmakers, federal judges, the Cabinet and
top—leve| bureaucrats; The House won't start hear-
ings on the issue until Monday, and the question
isn't yet on the floor debate agenda.

’ The Senate tacked a raise-rejecting amendment on
a bill to provide emergency aid to the homeless.
House Whip Tony Coelho, D—Ca|if., accused the
Senate of grandstanding, but House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, said he guessed the House would
be forced to go along.

declaration to‘ assure that mistakes on the .

Democratic retreat at a ritzy West Virgina resort
were speculating that lawmakers "just might find a
way to avoid the issue before the raises kick in.

The first clean-water override vote is set for Tues-
day in the House, which got the 1987 session off
to a quick start Jan. 8 by approving the legislation
406-6, a margin far beyond the two-thirds needed
to override the veto. .

1 Rep. James Howard, D-N.J., chairman of the Pub-
lic Works Committee, said he is sure the House will
trump the veto and send the issue back to the.Senate,
which on Jan. 21 approved the bill 93-6 after reject-
ing, 82-1 7, a less costly alternative proposed by the
president.

Reagan and Congress are fighting over familiar ter-
ritory: money. The bill calls for $18 billion through
1994 to help states construct more of the wastewater
and sewage treatment plants that have made the

clean-water program one of the'nation’s most suc—-

cessful environmental efforts.

The president, saying the bill is ”loaded with ‘

waste and larded with pork,” last year asked Con-
gress for $6 billion in state aid and then doubled
the offer this year in an unsuccessful try at com-
promise.

Even facing the veto override, the president won
one major point in the clean-water reauthorization
bill. Congress agreed to his insistence that the the
state subsidies be ended after the last installment in
1994.

mental Protection Agency estimates is another $90
billion in treatment plant construction in order to
complete the cleanup job begun with the first clean-
water act in 1972.

Testimony conflicts

By Lawrence "L. Knutson

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — In assessing
White House involvement in
secret arms sales to Iran, the
Senate . Intelligence Committee
was unable to resolve conflicts in

testimony between former Na-_t

tional Security Adviser Robert C.
McFarlane and others ‘in Presi-
dent Reagan’s inner circle.

The most significant conflict in-
volves testimony by McFarlane
and White House Chief of Staff
-Donald Regan on whether the
president gave ”oral” approval,
in advance, for Israeli shipments
of U.S. arms to Iran. , C

McFarlane has said Reagan did
give the project his verbal bless-
ing; But the chief of staff has tes-
tified that the president did not.

The committee said McFarlane-,
testifying in private, said the arms
transfer was supported by Regan,
Vice President George Bush and
CIA Director William Casey.

McFarlane said it was opposed
by Secretary of State George
Shultz, who "had earlier called the

' idea ”perverse,” and by Secretary

of Defense Caspar W. Weinberg-
er, who had dismissed it as
”absurd.”

”Although there is no written
record of a decision at this time,
McFarlane testified that the presi-
dent informed Shultz, Weinberg-
er and Casey of his decision,” the
committee said.

An earlier draft of the commit-
tee report, which was prepared
late last year while the panel was
still in Republican hands but was
never officially authorized for

on Iran arms deal

release, said McFarlane’s testimo-
ny was much more specific and
convincingrthan Regan’s.

The final report makes no such"

comment.

But it does lay out a number of
other conficts in testimony be-
tween McFarlane and others and
between McFarlane’s testimony
and other evidence.

McFarlane’s attorney, Leonard I

Garment, was asked for reaction
to the committee's characteriza-
tion of his client's testimony but
did not immediately return a
reporter's phone call.

The committee, for example,
said McFarlane testified he was

never told by the CIA that it had

reports that Israel had shipped
non—U.S. arms to Iran as early as
1981.

It quoted McFarlane as saying
that when he asked Casey if news
reports about such shipments

' were correct, he was told they

were false.

The committee "noted

McFarlane said if he had known _'

the Israelis b had previously
shipped arms to Iran, he would

have been less responsive to later 7

Israeli proposals to resume arms
shipments.

”However, in his first cable to
Shultz in the matter, he stated that
it was obvious to him that the Is-
raeli channel into Iran had exist-
ed for some time,” the
intelligence panelsaid.

There was also disagreement
between witnesses about
whether McFarlane told President
Reagan about the use of con-

troversial lranian arms merchant

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February 2, I987

Whereabouts of U.S. envoy remain a mystery

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Intensive
”hush—hush” negotiations involv-
ing Syria, Iran and Lebanese
militia leaders have started to de-
termine the fate of missing
hostage negotiator Terry Waite
and to ensure his safety, a senior
militia official said Sunday.

Waite, personal emissary of
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, flew to Beirut Jan. 12 on
his fifth trip to Lebanon to win
freedom for foreign hostages.

The Anglican Church envoy
has not been seen publicly since
he left the Riviera Hotel in west
Beirut on Jan. 20, presumably to
negotiate with Islamic Jihad, a
pro-Iranian Shiite faction that
holds Americans Terry Anderson
and Thomas Sutherland. Both
men were abducted in 1985.

Various reports have said
Waite may have been taken
prisoner.

Finance sought for
nuclear device

WASHINGTON —- President
_ Reagan will seek funds to build

     
       
    

   
 

the $6 billion nuclear particle
”supercollider,” sought for years
by the nation's physicists to probe
the scientific secrets of matter,
Energy Secretary John S. Herring-
ton announced Friday.

’’In high-energy physics, the
development of the supercollider
is the equivalent of putting a man
on the moon,” Herrington said at
a news conference.

He said the government would
seek to share the cost as much as
possible with other countries, pri-
vate industry and state and local
governments wherever the
nuclear particle accelerator is lo-
cated. No site has been picked,
and there is no frontrunner, he
added.

The Energy Department al-
ready has been spending about
$20 million a year on planning
the supercollider.

Hotel fire in Taiwan
ends celebration  

TAIPEI, Taiwan — Fire swept
through a hotel filled with
Taiwanese celebrating the

Chinese New Year on Sunday,
killing 18 people and injuring 13,
authorities said. Twenty people
jumped into safety nets to escape.

Most victims in the southern
Taiwanese hotel died of smoke
inhalation, apparently unable to
escape because of blocked exits,
according to officials.

Fire officials said emergency
exits were locked and blocked by
mattresses and by hotel supplies
piled in front of them.

They said police were inves-
tigating and would decide if safe-
ty regulations were violated at the
20-year-old Tung Pao Hotel.

Magee Women's Hospital introduces special clinic J

By Theresa Costello
Staff Writer

Magee—Womens Hospital re-
cently announced the opening of
a new service concentrating on
infertility, incontinence and im-
potence.

Dr. Walter O'Donnell, who su-
pervised the planning and works
at the clinic, said, ’’It is about

. time these so-callled ’closet’ dis-
. eases be addressed and taken

care of.” I. ._ .

sands of people in the city of
Pittsburgh.

garbage‘ can on the corner of Fifth
and Wood downtown.

problem,” said O'Donnell.
Many people who suffer from
incontinence are embarrassed by
their situation and view it as a
psychological problem rather
than a medical problem. They
think they are the only ones
struck with the illness; therefore,
they never seek medical help.
”There are probably more peo-
ple housebound in the United
"States because of incontinence
than because of limitations from
heart disease," said O'Donnell.
Magee already has a urology
department but, in the past, it al-

ways centered around females. .

The new program will also open

up facilties for males to receive
help.

Another one of Magee’s new
services that will complement
past programs is the expanded in-
fertility clinic. As with inconti-
nence, Magee mainly centered
on women's problems but will
now include men.

”Now we will be able to treat
the couple as an unit instead of
fragmenting the couple, which
often leads to finger pointing in
the couple,” said O'Donnell.

The third main area of the new
service is the treatment of impo-
tence in males.

This area is O’Donnell’s

specialty, and he has been treat-
ing patients since I974. Now, be-
cause of the new equipment and
facilities that Magee has brought
in, he will be able to help many
more patients.

One of the main hindrances in
treatment is that many patients
feel they are the only ones who
have these problems. - .

To help these patients, O'Don-
nell began a support group about
three, years ago named Impo-
tence Anonymous. In the group,
the patientsand their partners are
able to open up to each other and
also hear opinions and ideas from
other couples.

Little consideration
given to the blind

, Imagine not being able to see. It's something we've all been
told enough times, but the implications are still beyond most
of us. Imagine walking to an elevator, guided not by the ap-
pearance of the hall, nor by the signs posted, but by the feel
of the walls that needs to be painstakingly memorized.

Imagine hearing the doors of the elevator open, and not be-
ing able to see the sign on the wall, telling what the floor num-
ber is. Imagine all those problems, stacked like weights on the
multitude of difficulties borne alreadyby the blind. Imagine a
university possesing the ability to do something about the
problem, and doing nothing.

In a university Pitt's size, with the resourses that are here,
it is reprehensible that there is not proper consideration given
to the blind element of the student body.

In some of the elevators, there are plates with the braile trans-

wlation of the numbers. There are also beepers in some of them

that denote each passing floor. The important word, though,

is some. Not all. , ‘ -

It would not be a matter of huge expense to put braile in more
places in the university. The cost would probably be less than
the expense offputting the number 200 all over the campus,
and would serve the students. _

The room numbers in some of the newer buildings are in
braile, as are the numbers on the elevators, but it is not enough.

‘ -Any -student, regardless of their handicap, is entitled at least
’ to the knowledge of where they are~on the campus. Nothing

couldbe more frustrating than having to rely on the people
around to learn the number of the floor or the room one is stand-
ing before. Assuming, of course, that there is even a sighted

‘ person inthe area. .

Pitt has a responsibility to its students to provide all the help

I" within its means, and braile throughout the university is clear-

ly within Pitt's means. By ignoring the problem, allowing the
blind less than the best opportunity available, Pitt is ignoring
its own claims to equal opportunity.

LETTERS

Will Young's Aesopian fable in
the Jan. 28 edition of The Pitt
News concerning abortion was

extremely offensive and objec-

— his opinions from a human point

of view? Does he [tell] this tale
because he knows he cannot

.present a persuasive argument
otherwise? Is he merely‘ trying to
trivialize the issue of abortion?
Despite Young's implications,
abortion is a serious issue, and his
light treatment of it‘ renders the ar-
ticle ineffective.

Young uses childish spiteful-

ness throughout the tale (as in his '

labeling "Supreme Birdbrains”);
this is a desperate and pathetic
way to handle the argument. His

you cannot deny the fact that you

beled yourself, along with the rest
of the world, homicidal. This

-conclusion is obviously irrational.

I am interested in finding out
why you, as a man, feel you have
the right to interfere in a woman's
choice. Birth control is the best
solution for preventing abortions,
but unfortunately there is a high
margin of error involved. Raising

Hostage problems have
brought on the downfall of the
past two presidencies. In the Cart-

hardly compares to the one we're
faced with now..

The current administration has
been crippled, and irrevocably

wise the number of unwanted

thereby also raising the number

of Roe vs. Wade permits women
to control and protect their own
lives, emotionally and physical-
ly, and to have children when

they know they are ready to care
for an infant. [  ]

Mr. Anater’s ”better perspec-
tive” is expressed clearly enough
throughout his column in a
plethora of unevidenced and un-
supportable (but bold) assertions
puffed up further by gusts of
vacuous catch phrases and
cliches. Listen to some of the
most amusing ones.

so, by the machinations of the
presently popular terrorist groups.
They,‘ in effect, hold the entire
population of our country
"hostage with the threat of con-

’ tinued terrorist actions. We are

afraid to go anywhere, to travel,
to enjoy the rights we have as
American citizens.

' Most of the media's headlines
are devoted to hostages, to scan-
dals stemming from hostage situ-
ations, to our inability to act
when faced with the nameless
violence directed at us. We have
become pawns in the game of in-
ternational politics, and we can't
even see all the players.

Clearly, something needs to be I

done,

Do we ignore the terrorists,
refusing to recognize them as
valid parts of the world political
system, as has been the policy of
recent administrations? We have
seen that policy in action, a gross

and dream sweet dreams of the
future —— a future where happi-
ness will come from ‘Sharper Im-
age’ catalogues, read safely
behind the white picket fences of
suburbia  Who cares if they be-

. come little more than a cog in the ‘ '

machine of American pop cul-
ture?” [And] ”American universi-
ties have become glorified trade
schools. They don't seem to do
much but excrete a steady stream
of technocrats —- people as dull
as the machines they run.”

By attacking technical degrees
in this way, Mr. Anater is not only
doing a disservice to his own dis-
cipline but to one of the ultimate
aims of the university itself: to
teach its students to learn how to
reason and then to articulately
and persuasively defend their
conclusions, which had been ar-
rived at from the reasoning one
has done after fully. informing

spectacle amid the full-color pho-
tos of the innocent dead.

Do we sell them arms, placat-
ing them as children with candy?
I think not, criminals are not re-
habilitated with gifts of guns.

Do we stand by, doing nothing,
allowing events to» run their
downward-spiraling path un-
checked? There is no room for
apathy.

-We must fight the problem at
its root, not at the many
manifestations of the disease. We
must eliminate the effectiveness
of their actions, showing that
there is nothing to be gained by
playing the hostage game.

Wait, there is a dark implica-
tion here. How could we do that,
one might say, without allowing
hostages to die at the hands of
their captors? In all truthfulness,
there is no other way._

The emotional arguers will cry,
”But what if you were there?
Would you want your country to
let you die?” No, I wouldn't, but
I would rather be killed than see
my country give in to terrorists,’
paving the way for others to fol-
low me into captivity.

it makes no sense

oneself. All disciplines must do
these things, and this is one of the
most basic values of a liberal arts
degree — to have provided the
student with the ability to reason.
Mr. Anater provided his readers
with only a smug smearing of all
non—liberal arts majors. .

It is readily apparent that suffi-
cient inquiry had not been made
into what technical degrees are,
since Mr. Anater had failed to
describe their nature, emphasis or
students in any concrete terms.
Since he had inadequate informa-
tion about his subject, Mr Anater
could not reason about it. He,
therefore, could not make an ar-
ticulate, persuasive and defensi-
ble statement about the con-
clusions he had drawnfrom his
(lack of)’ reasoning. [...]’

THE PITT News, Monday, February 2, 1987

We've got a way to go

"We shall overcome."
To many members of our

generation, raised during the rela— A

tively passive 70's and coming of
age during the techno-ambitious
80's, "these three words mean
very little.

What a shame. To a generation
before us, these words evoke the
supreme symbol of pride to some
of its members, and to others, a
deserved defeat. But as the old
saying goes, '’Fool me once, the
laugh’s on me. Fool me twice,
and the laugh’s on” you, .for.I'm

_ the fool." Itseems we may all be

turning into fools.

Yesterday marked the begin-
ning of Black History Month. This
should be a time when everyone
can revel in the beauties and
bounties of black culture.
However, this may not be the
case this year. Because of recent
events in our country, we are star-
ing into the hideous face of ra-
cism not seen since the days
when Bull Connor ruled the
streets of Birmingham with guard

dogs and fire hoses and national E

guardsmen were on constant alert
more than 20 years ago.
Even though the scenario has

changed, the problem itself has
not. This time, we move from the

urban streets of Birmingham,’

Montgomery and Selma to the
quiet county of Forsyth in Geor-
gia. The deep south is brewing
once again, and although it
seems unfathomable that such a
situation could occur again in this
day and age, this rural theater
holds the potential to be just as
violent and just as ugly as its
predecessors. '

The town of Cumming in For-
syth County is where the hoopla
happened last week. Although it
seems a very meager village [pop.
2000 out of 38,000 in the whole
county] Cumming has its own
historical stain. In» 1912, an
18-year-old white ,woman was

raped and beaten there, and be— .

fore she died, she named three
blacks as her killers. Two ofthem
were hanged after a ’ltrial" and

CHRISTOPHER
SEPESY

the other was lynched. The other
black residents of Forsyth County
were intimidated into leaving
thereafter, and since there has not
been one black.

As a vehicle of goodwill, black
leaders planned a march of
brotherhood through Forsyth
County to celebrate the recently
instated national holiday memori-
alizing Martin Luther King. But
when they arrived, they did not
find the brotherhood they sought.
Instead, they were greeted with
thrown rocks, waving confeder-
ate flags and chants of "Niggers
go home.”

_The great but very controversial '

comedian Lenny‘ Bruce once had
a routine about the use ofthe
word nigger. He said he would
like to see the president (Kenne-
dy in his day) appear on televi-
sion and begin to introduce all
the "niggers" in his cabinet, and
then after that, all of the ”spics"
and then the "wops” and so on.
And after he was through, after
every nigger had been introduced
and the word had been said so
much so that it didn't mean any-'
thing anymore, then never again
would some poor black child

‘have to cry because someone

called them a nigger. Unfor-

tunately, this does not seem pal- i

pable in the near future.

But Forsyth County is only one .

factionin this newly-cloaked ra-
cism. Howard Beach in New
York City is another, where three
black men were beaten by 11
white youths and one of the
blacks died under the wheels of
a passing car while trying to es-
cape. This act has caused dissen-
tion in the streets of New York so
great that police platoons have
been increased in- some districts
threefold. ’

And the most heinous threat of
them all, affecting not only blacks

but whites, the constitution and
free American society as we
know it, is the proposed ban of
what is probably the definitive
work ofAmerican literature, The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
because ”it provides the reader
with an unhealthy view of inter-

course, coalition, and collabora— .

tion between the caucasian-and
negro races.” The. proposing
committee, a faction ofjerry Fal-
well’s Moral Majority, also states
the book promotes homosexual-
ity, criminal conduct and an un-
realistic view of true American
life. But censorship is another
problem. What we must do now
is study why racism in this coun-
try, after 200 years of battle after
bloody battle, still exists and try
at least to find a sensible solution.

The South always seems to
play a major role whenever the
subject arises, but I can guaran-
tee you not all white Southerners
are red—necked bigots. I hold
heritage in the South and am a
member of the Kappa Alpha Ord-
er, a fraternity based on the
philosophies of Robert E. Lee and
the idea of true southern honor.

But in these precepts there is no .-

room for racism, nor will any be
tolerated.

What Americans must do is
stop being ostriches and realize
the beast is not yet dead. Blacks
are not the only group threatened
— remember what Hitler did to
the Jews a few years back?

From F. Scott Fitzgerald's The
Great Gatsby, a quote. Not a
large one, but extremely signifi-
gant ‘nonetheless: _’.’§o we beat
on, like boats against the current,
borne back ceaselessly into the
past.” .

Although we .as Americans
have a proud and prestigious his-
tory, we still have the dark spot
of racism on our skins that hasyet
to be erased and will grow like
a cancer if not stopped wholly.
We must change that current Fitz-
gerald spoke of, for if we don't,
we shall’ never overcome, for as
recent events prove, we haven't
yet. None of us.

started a new enterprise that
he hopes will eventually make
him hundreds of thousands of
dollars. His company is called
Urico, and the service it pro-
vides can be summed up in
the first few workds of the
newspaper advertisement the
businessman has placed:

illegal substances!”

ment,'Urico is listed as a post
office box in _Denton, Texas. I
got hold of the businessman
who has started Urico. He would identify himself to me only ,
by his first name — he said it was Sam —- and he was quite
clear on why he thinks he has a potentially profitable corpo-
ration. '

The ‘ capitalist way  

to take a drug test. -

A Texas business man has

 

"Pure! Human Urine. No

In the newspaper advertise-

”With so many businesses and government agencies giving

urine tests to employees and prospective employees, there is
a need for this service,” he said. "Many people are undoubt-

‘ edly aware that they have drugs in their urine, We send them
urine that is drug-free. We don't tell them what to do with it,
but it's pretty "obvious that they submit it instead of their own
urine.” ‘

Sam said that "many people feel that urine testing is unfair

and unconstitutional. We offer a way around the testing. In a
business sense, I'm convinced that urine selling is the up-and-
coming thing to do.” ' ‘

Urico has been in operation for only two months. "I’llrget

the urine from myself and my friends," Sam said. 7’I'rn not a _
drug user, and I know that they-aren't either. We keep the urine
. refigerated , and when we get an order we ship it in a little plas-
» tic container. Wesend the urine through the U.S. mail.”

He said that so far he has filled approximately 40 orders. His

business is being hampered, he said, by the refusal of some pub-.
lications to accept his ads. A " I
' ”Both the Dallas Morning News and the Dallas'Times Her-
ald turned me down immediately,” he said. "I tried to go for
a national audience through the tabloids. I submitted my ad
to the National Enquirer and to the Globe. They turned me
down too, which surprised me." - ‘ '

‘ .

He did get one taker.-— The Dallas Observer, a free weekly. 2

So he knows that all of his orders have come via that ‘publica-
tion. He said he feels frustrated — he is convinced that if larger
publications would accept his ads, he would be on his way to
wealth. ’ i '

His customers have been both male and female, he said, and 4 '
although none of them have mentioned on their order forms _
how they plan to use the urine, he is sure he know the answer.

"I'm positive that they'll sneak it into the testing site,,”’Sam

said. "They'll conceal it, and then they'|l~close the door and
they'll pour it into the cup. Then they'll walk back out and give
the cup to the examiner.”

Urico's price scale is: $18 for four’ ounces of urine; $32 for

eight ounces, and $12 for every additional four ounces.

I asked Sam if he thought what he is doing is in any way

"Yeah, it's kind of immoral,” he said. "But the economy is
kind of depressed down here in Texas, and I thought it would
be an easy way to make some money.” -

something new

The letter arrived by crow. The
charges were listed, and the sen-

tence was clear. It was to be"
, death by public lynching. What

could I do? Each of the charges,
except the false ones, were true.
And the sentence, not to be con-
cluded in the commie-filled
stench of the local courthouse,
would be doled out by pro-
American vigilantes, for_ whom
due process is a sleight of hand-.

I reviewed the charges in the ._

hopes that therezmightbe some‘

. evidence, something s,u'bstantia_|

First on the listlwasx evidence of I

ticle I had written in sympathy for

Then there. was a photo of. my
presence in a synagogue, aged
13‘. C_learly, it meant I was a pawn
of the Jewish Conspiracy.

To be hanged for this? No!
There was more. I had secretly
slipped the launch codes for the
missiles on th'e,Siberian Steppes-
to members of Motley Crue and

_Quiet Riot. I. had conspired for.

and I had once taken.LSD. .

Ah, distinctly I remember, it
was in bleak December, and the
ghost of Henry Cabot Lodge,

floor.‘ , . «

Then came. the worst of‘i_t, and

tercepted a letter to a former girl-
friend in which I had remarked,
"No doubt, you found me a
dictator.”

They declared that a formal
renunciation of my citizenship-

must be preceded with public '

whipping. They then would
chain me to apost and burn me

alive. All this was inevitable, for»
they could not be expected to be— ‘I

He feels that Urico is in the forefront of a growth industry.

”There are an awful lot of drug users _in the United States,” he .
said. ”And it's becoming pretty obvious that urine testing is go-
ing to be increasing. so the drug users have two choices: sub-
mit. their own urine and lose their jobs’ or buy somebody else's'_
urine and keep their jobs." ' .
/ Oddly, Sam does not blame private industry and the govern- '
rnent for wanting to conduct urine tests. _ r

’’I wouldn't want a drug user. working for me," he said. "On ’

PPC offers
options to
university  

By Lisa Krisay
For The Pitt News

What does a typical Pitt student
do on the weekends? See a
movie, go to a party, maybe go
downtown? -

The Student Activities Board
and the Pitt Program Council is
attempting to meet the changing
needs of Pitt students.

According to Tom Misuraca,
assistant director of student activi-
ties, the purposes of the PPC are
to provide the students with
educational, entertaining and cul-
tural events at a low or no cost,
and secondly, to help students on
the PPC develop skills by active
participation in setting up perfor-
mances.

The PPC considers various in-

- terests representediin the univer-

sity, thereforepthe students select
and plan all events.

Since 1980, the organization
has grown to over 250 members
and produces nearly 200 pro-
grams annually.

The PPC has 12 commitees,
each of which is responsible for
selection and preparation of a
specific form of entertainment.
They sponsor major art programs,
concerts, films, homecoming fes-
tivities, lectures, debates and
forums.

The Leisure Learning Program
offers students a variety of low-
‘cost, no—credit courses such as
aerobics, photography, self-
defense, dance and Chinese ex-
ercise. '

The PPC also sponsors trips to
Daytona and Chicago.

Greg Romeo, a freshman phar-
macy major, said basketball
games are a good form of enter-
tainment for students. He said
students ‘who are not Greek
sometimes have limited places to
socialize. He suggested student
dances would be an option for

‘ Pitt students.

’’I think there should be more
interaction between students
‘rather than a group oriented pro-
gram, such as a movie or a per-
former although these are
excellent forms of entertain-
ment,” said Romeo.

Melanie Naro, Student Govern-
ment Board member, empha-
sized that there are enough
activities for students, and that
students are made aware of these
activities through advertisements.

On the opposite side, freshman
Paul McNamee said movies that
the PPC provides are only a small
part of entertainment on
weekends, and speakers, such as
Sidney Biddle Barrows, should be
held on weekends instead of
weekdays.

”A social gathering place with
more of a party atmosphere
should be available to students
because there is nothing to do,”
said McNamee.

Kathy Bost, another student,
said more planned activities
should be as available as they
were during her freshman advis-
ing and orientation sessions.

Many other students have sug-
gested that a ”social pub” should
be created where students can so-
cialize more with others.

A proposal has been made by
Phil Moyer, SGB President, that
a non-alchoholic, under-21 night-
club be arranged for Pittstu.d_en_ts.

Continued from page 3

Gus Fuqua of Pittsburgh said
he likes it, too. ”He gives me the
truth. I love that. I just want to
take it in and eat it,” said Fuqua.

Born and raised in Pittsburgh,
the man with the ”unimportant
name” said God found him in
1971. He said that was when he
began to preach.

”I did exactly what I thought
was right in my mind. Without
me knowing it, I was searching
for something. And I had no idea
what I was searching for. Jesus
says to shout it from the house-
top, and I'm carrying out the
command of Jesus Christ to go
preach to every creature,” he
said. ‘

A young man shouted, ”What

pal?” while another youngman ’

stopped to listen.

are lost,” said the young man

gan's hospital room in July 1985.
At the time, Reagan ‘was recover-

ing from cancer surgery.

It said McFarlane ”categorical—
ly denied any discussion of Chor-
banifar with the president,”
saying that it wasn't until Decem-
ber that he became aware of
Ghorbanifar’s identity.

But the panel added that
McFarlane told Shultz in aJuly 14,
cable that one of the Iranians he
had in mind was ”an adviser to

the prime minister named Chor-

banifar.”

The committee also noted a
”divergence of views” on
whether presidential approval of
Israeli shipments of U.S. missiles
to Iran came at an August 1985
meeting or later.

The report said Regan testified .

the president declined to autho-
rize the Israeli shipment ”be-
cause of misgivings about
Ghorbanifar’s credentials and in-
fluence in Iran'’’ and because
other participants agreed it was
premature to get involved in arms

V‘ sales to the Iranians.

”McFarlane, on the other hand,
testified that Ghorbanifar’s name
never came .up at the August

- meeting,” the committee said.

Declaration forgovernance of space societies drawn

By Saul Pett

AP Special Correspondent

WASHINGTON — It is one of
the charms of this capital that,
while an angry Congress up the
street was investigating the sale of
American arms to an avowed
enemy, while across town the
State Department was being told
by its negotiators in Geneva that
the world was no safer from
nuclear wrath, while I2 people
were killed in riots in South Afri-
ca and many more died in wars
in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Iran
and ‘ Iraq, while mankind in a

continued to show a questiona-
ble ability to govern its own
planet, a group of American
citizens with the blessing of the
government gathered in
Washington to discuss how the
human race might civilize space.

Lawyers, scholars, educators,
historians and space specialists,
including the last human being to
walk on the moon, came together
to frame a ”Declaration of First
Principles for the Governance of
Space Societies.”

It is a wooden title for a fas-
cinating effort to produce some-

At this stage, the 22 conferees
are not‘ yet clear whether they
have in mind a celestial new na-

of the United States. But they are
confident that space colonization
is as inevitable as the westward
movement of man was in 1492.

In their effort to form a more

are thinking now of American set-

lar monument to human progress

and failure. Here are the crafts ,

that the Wright Brothers flew at
Kitty Hawk, Charles Lindbergh
flew to Paris, and that astronauts

”We need to try now to find
ways to save space from the
problems of Earth,” said George
S. Robinson, associate general
counsel of the Smithsonian and
a prime mover of the conference.

”We need to think about how
to avoid the colonialism and
revolution, the nationalism and
war that accompanied the evolu-
tion of societies on this planet.”

Robinson, who holds three law
degrees, including a doctorate in
space law, thinks that the rules of
conduct by which humans live
on Earth will have to be modified
for life out there.

Living in the alien, synthetic
environment of another planet or
a colony orbiting in the void of

M.cRae wins 60 yards at Millrose Games

By Sam Tallarico
For The Pitt News

Pitt junior track star Lee McRae,
proving he is a dominant force in
the 60-yard dash, captured first
place at the Millrose Games in
New York's Madison Square
Garden on Friday night.

McRae, who holds the world
indoor record in the 60-yard dash
with a 6.00, was clocked at 6.12

The Panther Express rolled
on Saturday night, breezing

necticut team 73-52 and mov-
ing in to a three—way tie atop
the Big East Conference with
Providence and Syracuse.

The Panthers improved their
record to 17-4, 6-2 in the Big
East, as five Pitt players scored
in double figures for the se-
cond game in a row.

’’I think it's been a real plus
the last five or six "games to
have the scoring spread
around,” said Pitthead coach

ly had to count on anyone.
When someone has had an off
night, someone else has
picked up the slack.”

Senior guard Curtis Aiken
led the Panther offense for the
second consecutive game,
pouring in 18 points, 15 in the
first half — including three
three-pointers. ‘

”|’ve been a lot more patient
on offense,” Aiken said. ’’I
think that lately I've been tak-
ing the good shots rather than

_ just taking shots, and that has
been the difference.”

Another difference for the
Panthers has been the play of
forward Jerome Lane — the
nation's leading rebounder.
Lane had 14 points and pulled

rebounding average to 13.2 a
game.

Also helping out inside for
the Panthers was center
Charles Smith, who scored 11
points (eight on slam dunks)
and added seven rebounds.

Paul Evans. ”We haven't real— 1

down 12 boards, bringing his I

medalist Carl Lewis, who ran
6.14.‘

”He is ahead of last year's pace
and confidence-wise, he's fine,”
said Pitt men's track coach John
Vasvary. ”He was super, great.”

McRae was not the only one
who faired well at the games. Eric

Cannon, Pitt's 60-yard hurdler,i

finished with a time of 7.37. He
captured third in his preliminary
heat, but only the top two in each
heat advanced.

Breezing        
Pitt beats UConn, tied for first in Big East

Smith credited much of the in-
side success to point guard Pat
Cavanau_gh, who replaced Ai-
ken with about 15 minutes left
in the game.

”Pat came in the game, and
the only thing he was thinking
about was ‘getting the ball in-
side,” Smith said. ”He hitJer-
ome down low with anice
pass for a dunk and had a nice
alley-oop to me for a dunk.
That was his main thing —— to
get the ball inside.”

Another pleasant surprise
this season for the Panthers
has been the play of freshman
forward Rod Brookin, who
had’1’1 points and three re-
bounds against the Huskies.

”Brookin may be our most
improved player,” said
Evans,”because at the begin-

ning of the season he couldn't, --

guard anyone. He's made
tremendous improvement
defensively.

”He’s certainly on my All-
Big East freshman team, be-
cause he's come through in
big games.”

The fifth Panther in double
figures was sophomore guard '
Mike Goodson, who chipped
in 12 points, including a pair
of three-pointers.

”Mike’s also made a lot of
improvement,” Evans said.
”At the beginning of the year,
he was having all sorts of
problems, but now he's doing
all right.”

One of the things that
pleases Evans the most about
this Panther team is the abili-
ty to adapt to what other teams
throw at them.

’’I’m fairly pleased “with the,

Please see Pitt, page 14

 

”Eric did a pretty good job. The
competition was tough, but it was
a good learning experience for
him. He's ready for the nation-
als,” said Vasvary.

Pitt was also represented by the
two-mile relay team which con-
sists of Bob Weiner, Joe Daniels,
Tim Manes and Dave Moore.
They have turned in the fastest
time in the nation this year at
7:27:02 but finished this
weekend with a time of 7:34:56.

Mike Goodson, pictured here driving to the hoop between two defenders, scored 12

points in Saturday's game.

They placed fourth, finishing be-
hind Georgetown, Westchester
Puma Track Club and Villanova.
The relay team could have
finished higher but Moore, the
anchor leg in the relay, was sick
and his performance was not up
to par. Pitt had the lead after three
legs, but Moore's illness caused
him to drop to fourth place.
Jesse Mikell, Dave’Price, Ver-
non Reed and Alan Laws make
up the mile relay team, finished

third with a time of 3:22:35 be- .

hind Iona and Alabama.

’’Overall, I was fairly pleased. ‘

We performed pretty well and

had it not‘have been for the ill-” -

ness, we could have placed
higher in the event,” added
Vasvary. r

Pitt's next meet will be at Fitz-
gerald Field House on Saturday
when they will compete against
Marshall College.

Rebounding from a disappoint-
ing loss to Cleveland State last
Thursday, the Pitt Panther
wrestling team responded with
an impressive 25-17 non-league

“victory over Navy on Rex Peery

Day at Fitzgerald Field House.
The victory improved the 11th-
ranked Panthers overall record to
9-1 and put them back on the
winning track for" Friday night's
league match at Bloomsburg.

Pitt sophomore Matt Rizzo
(118) pinned Navy's Mike
Dinardo 29 seconds into the se-
cond period to give Pitt an early
6-0 lead.

Following Matt Gerhard’s deci-
sion of Navy's John Kainer, the
Midshipmen pulled back to with-
in six when Matt Treaster deci-
sioned Pitt's Alan Utter, 5-1, at
134 pounds. '

Sophomore All-American Pat
Santoro gave the Panthers a 14-3
lead with an impressive 17-5 su-
perior decision over Navy's Craig

Dellorso at 142 pounds.

’’I was nervous going in. l wres-
tled him close last year and knew
he was going to be tough,” said
Santoro, who improved his in-
dividual record to 31-1 with the
victory.

At 150, Pitt's Gary Bolin and
Navy's Paul Radomski battled to
a 10-10draw and at 158, Navy's
Scott Schleicher decisioned Pitt's
Eric Wertz 11-8 to cut the Panther
lead to 16-8.

The Midshipmen then cut the

lead to three when Pitt's Mike.

     

Rossi was decisioned 7-4 by Tho-
mas Tierney. However, the Navy
rally was abruptly halted at 177
when Pitt's Mike Tongel manhan-
dled Ronald Neff. Tongel pinned
Neff just 45 seconds into the
match. The victory increasedthe
Panthers’ lead to 11 and virtual-
ly assured the win.

’’I was psyched,” said Tongel,

a junior. ’’I’m happy that my win.

really helped the team win. After
Cleveland State, we were down.
The loss woke us up. We_need-

Santoro agreed. ”Cleveland

Unlikely foursome doing wonders for Pitt K

 

Ninety seconds into the Pitt-
Connecticut game at Fitzgerald
Field House on Saturday night,
Panther forward Demetreus Gore
made a monumental mistake.

Gore had the ball on a two-on-

_ one fastbreak with teammate Cur-

tis Aiken, but instead of passing
he faked _to Aiken and missed an
off-balanced shot, picking up a
charging foul in the process.

Immediately, Pitt coach Paul
Evans substituted freshman Rod
Brookin for Gore, who was the
recepient of some harsh words
and icy glares from his coach for
his failure to pass the ball.

Gore sat on the bench for the
next eight minutes, but it didn't
affect this Pitt team one bit.

Bro_okin scored seven first-half
points in Gore's place as the Pan-
thers easily defeated the talent-
less Huskies 73-52 to grab a share
offirst place in the Big East along-
side Syracuse and surprising
Providence.

Pitt's win over Connecticut —
minus Gore's usual 15 points per
game; he scored two that night —
wasn't surprising. The Panthers

I

i probably could have beaten this

team without half. of its top eight
players.

What is surprising is that Pitt
(17-4) has won many games this
season without star performances
from many of its stars.

Consider this:

0 Panther center Charles Smith
was a player whose scoring aver-
age directly correlated with Pitt's
winning percentage the previous
two years. As Charles went, so
went the Panthers.

This season the 6-10 junior has
scored 11 points or less in six

' games.

The Panthers are 6-0 in those
games.

9 Pitt is 6-1 when Gore scores
12 points or less. ”Meech” has
averaged 9.3 points in the Big
East, where Pitt stands 6-2. '

Quite impressive for a team,
even with this much talent to win
consistently without big nights
from the top two scorers on last
year's team.

”We have good balance,” said
Evans. ”Even iftwo guys have off
nights we can still win.”

JOHN
ENRIGI-I'|'

That is testimony to the chang-
ing complexion of this Panther
basketball team, which seems to
be making its long-awaited move
towards supremacy as the Big
East season enters its second half.

Panther forward Jerome Lane,
who has made the change from
All-World crybaby into All-
American prospect, attributes that
to the team's work ethic.

”We’re working hard in prac-
tice every day and playing
together as a team,” said Lane.
”Everything is together. Right
now our team is at the highest
point. You can't get any better
than how we're playing now.”

It isva direct result of four play-
ers in particular. No, not Lane,
Smith, Gore and Aiken, a four-
some whose combined talents
can't be touched by any team in
the conference.

Rather, the foursome of

THE PITTINEWS, Monday, February 2, 1937

Brookin, point guard Mike Good-
son, freshman walk—on ‘Pat
Cavanaugh and senior center
Tico Cooper has been the key to
elevate this team from beyond
the shadows of great expectations
to the reality of NCAA Final Four
possibilities. ,
Brooki-n could be the unsung

" hero of this team. His clutch free

throws against Kansas in the final
minutes of the first round of the
Rainbow Classic assured a victo-
ry which has turned the season
around.

It was a victory that erased the
seemingly nightmarish happen-
ings of Dec. 23, when Pitt lost at
Brigham Young 93-73, a loss that
seemed to indicate that this
talented group of players lacked
the character to win on the road.

The Panthers haven't lost a‘

road game since.

Brookin has averaged 8.5
points in Big East games and has
played more than 18 minutes a
game. His sparkling play hasn't
gone unnoticed. ”Rod’s played
well for us,” said Lane. ”Just be-
cause he wasn't a high school All-

American or considered one of
the top 50 or 60 players in the
country doesn't matter. He's a
good player.” ”

The story of Mike Goodson
somewhat ‘resembles that of
Brookin. Nothing much was ex-
pected of Goodson this year, for
no other reason than the fact he
is -a freshman with a sophomore
tag. '

Fifty-seven minutes of playing
time last year isn't playing ex-
perience. It’s more like ”mop-up”
time. _

So when this season began,
No. 11 was still green behind the
ears. And he stayed that way for
along while, even after Evans
demoted him in practice after a
pitiful performance against
Robert Morris in December.

That wasn't enough to inspire
Goodson, so Evans lit a fire un-
der him. He inserted Cavanaugh
in Coodson’s place for 32
minutes against Duquesne.

Since, Goodson has been out-
standing. It was once thought
Goodson didn't need to score for
this team to win. He has averaged
9.5 points in Big East play. ,

That in itself seems like
”enough said,” but Evans offered
more. ”Brookin and Goodson

The Lady Panther basketball
team extended its Big East losing
streak to 12 games by falling to
the University of Connecticut
75-62 on Saturday afternoon at
Fitzgerald Field House.

In the Big East, Pitt has won
only two of their last 16 games,
beating Connecticut twice last
season while not winning at all
this season.

The loss drops the Lad,yjPan-
thers to 0-10 in the Big East this
year, 5-15 overall. The Huskies
improved their record to 6-4 in
the conference, 9-9 overall.

”When they start believing in
themselves, we'll have a better
shot at winning," said Pitt coach
Kirk Bruce. ’’We went back to the
basics during the last few prac-
tices, but we're like two totally
different teams in practices and
games. -

”We talked to them about tak-
ing people to theibasket, playing
hard defense, boxing out, catch-
ing the_ba|l, squaring up, making
good passes,” Bruce added.
”These are all things you're sup-
posed to take care of in games
without even thinking about
them — they should happen au-
tomatically.”

However, they are not happen-

ing. Pitt fell behind early on, as

Notre Dame 60
North Carolina 58

By Thomas P. Wyman

Associated Press Writer

SOUTH BEND, Ind. ——- David
Rivers scored all of his 14 points
in the second half, including a
field goal and two free throws in
the final minute, as Notre Dame
upset top-ranked North Carolina
60-58 Sunday, the fifth time in 13
years the Fighting Irish have beat-
en a No. 1 team at home.

Two free throws in the closing
seconds by Gary Voce, who led
the Irish with 15 points, sealed
the victory as Notre Dame rallied
from a 16-point deficit at the Ath-
letic and Convocation Center to
snap the Tar Heels’ 16-game win-
ning streak.

Rivers, playing inlfoul trouble’

much of the second half, scored
eight of his points after picking up
his fourth foul. North Carolina,
18-2, played without its leading
scorer, Kenny Smith, who under-
went arthroscopic knee surgery
Saturday and is expected to miss
two weeks. 0

Notre Dame, 12-5, used some
sharp -free throw‘ shooting in the
closing minutes. 4

Voce made two foul shots with
2:49 to play, followed by two
more from Donald Royal 30 se-
conds later to bring the Irish with-
in one point, 53-52.

North Carolina's Joe Wolf, who

BASKETBALL S

scored 14 points, answered with
a field goal at 1:54, then fouled
Voce as he scored again 18 se-
conds later. Voce missed the free
throw for the three-point play, but
a North Carolina player tipped
the ball out of bounds and Rivers
followed with his jumper with
1:06 to go, giving the Irish their
first_lead since early in the first
half. I

North Carolina's J.R. Reid, who
finished with'12 points, drove un-
der the basket and missed with

20 seconds left and Rivers made,

two free throws four seconds later
for a 58-55 lead.

Thirteen seconds later, North
Carolina's Jeff Lebo, who scored
11 points, missed a 3-point shot.

Reid fouled Voce on a rebound
in the Irish’s next possession, and

the Notre.Dame crowd explod-

ed, tossing scores of placards on
the floor as Notre Dame was as-
sessed a technical foul. -

Voce made both free throws
and Lebo made the technical.
North Carolina had possession of
the ball but Wolf missed a 3-point
shot in the_closing seconds and
Lebo followed with the rebound
for the final margin.

Ranzino Smith scored eight
points in his starting role in place
of Kenny Smith, who was
released-from the North Carolina
infirmary Sunday.

AUBURN, Ala. -- Guard Fred-

cluding 27 on 3-point field goals
— and forward Armon Gilliam
added 31 as third-ranked
Nevada-Las Vegas defeated No.
19 Auburn 104-85 in an intersec-

' tional college basketball game

Sunday.

Banks hit nine of 13 3-point at-
tempts and 13 of 21 overall from
the field as the Runnin’ Rebels
improved their record to 21-1.

For the. game, UNLV, a Pacific
Coast Athletic Conference team

‘that was ranked No. 1 for eight‘

weeks this season, hit 14 of 28
3-point shots.

Chris Morris and Jeff Moore led
Auburn, 12-6, with 17 points

apiece and Mike Jones added 16 »

before 12,584 fans, the second-
largest basketball crowd, in the
Tigers history. ,

UNLV led 60-49 at halftime

and Auburn’s Frank Ford hit the-

first field goal of the second half

with 19:04 left and cut the mar-

gin to nine. ’ ‘

But the Rebels outscored the
Tigers of the Southeastern Confer-
ence 29-10 over the next‘ 12
minutes to build an 89-61 lead
with 9:13 remaining. During that
stretch, Gilliam had nine points
and Banks six.

UNLV was able to stifle the
Tigers’ inside game in the second
half with a tight 2-3 zone defense.

The Tigers’ front line of Jones,
Morris and Moore had combined
to score 32 points in the first half,
but the trio was held to 18 in the
second half.-" ' f '

Ford and Aundrae Davis each
scored 11 for the Tigers, while
Gerald Paddio had 11 for UNLV.

Pitt honors formerwrestling coach Peery  

By Vince Carey

Sta ff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
honored its former great wrestling
coach Rex Peery before the Pitt-
Navy match in front of a large
Fitzgerald Field House crowd
yesterday afternoon.

”This is real nice,” said Peery,
who coached at Pitt from
1949-1963. ”I never expected
anything like this to happen. I am
very pleased.”

In 1949 Tom Hamilton, then
Pjtt’s athletic director, wanted to
restart a wrestling program that

THE ADMINISTRATION

had been disbanded for some
time. He managed to convince
Peery to take the job of coach.

”At the time I was a high
school coach in Tulsa, Oklaho-
ma,” Peery said. ”I picked up the
whole family and moved to Pitts-
burgh. It was a chance that I

. couldn't turn my back on.

”Tom [Hamilton] was the only
true athletic director that I have
ever known. He really cared
about the sports programs and
didn't get lost in other things.”

In those days,‘ the coach was
the program. Peery had to do all
of the scouting and recruiting

himself. ”I didn't have an assis-
tant coach until my fifth season.
That was my oldest son, Hugh,
and he only came by after his
classes were done. So it took a lot
of effort on my part.”

Coach Peery also had to fight

, the practice conditions given to

him by the school. ”The high
school that I coached at in Tulsa
had some of the best equipment
available at the time. There was
almost nothing at Pitt,” ‘said
Peery. ”We had to practice on a
14x25 foot stage, that was in the
back of the gym at the old Trees
Hall. The gym classes had the
floor, and we couldn't interfere

good, but it's nothing like our

league is hell, and we'll have to
bear down and work hard again

I with them. '

If Peery was a coach now, his
style would be labled as unortho-
dox and strict. In the 1950's, he
was just like all of the rest. ”With
him, there were no shortcuts,”
said his son.Ed, the head coach
at Navy who watched his team

, lose to the Panthers 25-17. ”He
was a firm believer in hard work,
and he tried to reinforce it with
good, clean living. I firmly be-
lieve that, at the time, he was the
best technical coach in the
country.

”lt’s tremendous that Pitt is
honoring him for what he has
done, and I'm glad that I could be

13

a part of it,” he said.

The ceromony, which lasted
15 minutes, started off with Mr.
Peery standing alone, at the focal
point of all who wanted to see;
As the floor announcer started to
describe some of his accomplish-
ments at Pitt —— including a
116-43-2 record and 26 consecu-
tive victories as coach —— people
started to rise to their feet and

give Peery a rousing standing _

ovation.

One look at the smile on his
face showed that this was one of
the happiest moments of his life.

It was.we|l deserved. ‘

different styles,” he said. ”Some-
times we're able to run, but when
we're not, then our" half-court

Our shooting percentage has
even been pretty good.” -

The victory puts the Panthers in
first place in the Big East for the
first time, not counting league
openers. But Evans seemed cau-
tious about the news.
