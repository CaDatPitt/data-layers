Parking Problems

The biggest problem of the
Security Department at present
is the reduction and reassignment
of parking spaces for the faculty
and staff because of the loss of
space where the new dorms are
being ‘built, according to Captain
Charles Ray.

Another difficulty will be the
conflict in the quadrangle on Fri-
day nights between parking for
the A Pittsburgh First National
Bank and student pep rallies.
Captain Ray states, “How this is
going to work out I want to see.”

“A well-equipped ambulance
vehicle for the use of the stu-
dents, faculty and staff has been
added to the department’s equip-
ment,” says Captain Ray. ‘V

“In mid-July two-way "radios
were installed in the vehicles and
central office, greatly increasing
efficiency,” he added.

_In the third of three required
Men’s Conferences, freshmen will
hear a tape recording by the
Army discussing the effects of
communist brain -washing on
American troops captured during
the Korean War.

The other two required ses-
sions that make up one phase of
the program will be a criticism
of Orientation Week and the
Academic Life Panel, and a dis-
cussion of personal and social ad-
justment to college life.

Freshmen signed, up in groups
of 15 to 20 to meet for these talks
on the 8th ﬂoor with staff mem-
bers from the Dean of Men’s Of-
ﬁce and other faculty members.

“How to Study.” A
The “How to Study" course
was set up this fall. “We felt

The third phase is optional.
Those freshmen who wish to, may

Students ound ‘Borrowing’ Invoices .

Spouse, Date Ticket O Sals   Drop,

By HARRIET WERNER

Sale of spouse and date tickets,
for football games has dropped5

lower. than any stock on the mar-

- ket this year.

I-Iarry L. Berry, director of the
Student Information desk, in
comparing last year’s sellout of
spouse tickets with the present
sale of-eight, speculated very lit-
tle about the cause of the de-
crease. After the elimination of
the identiﬁcation card last year,
students generated the idea of
borrowing invoices, he said.

Although the index of sales re-
mained constant last year, Uni-
versity oﬁicials contemplated that
the idea would gain impetus

eventually. It has, according to

Berry. T’

“I can getyyou an invoice -
don’t buy a ticket”, he has
overheard many students tell
his perspective customers.

With the exception of football
tickets, however, student pur-

,chases have remained consistent

with last year’s sales. Organiza-
tions currently offering student
discount rates are the Pittsburgh
Symphony Society, the Pittsburgh
Opera Company, and the Nixon
Theater.

In addition to selling tickets,
Berry operates a general in-
formation center. He said that
his most enjoyable job is “so-
cializing with students.”

Before‘ coming to the Univer-
sity, Berry worked for 33 years
with the H. J. Heinz Co. as a
salesman. He will celebrate his
11th year of employment With
the University on December 22.

HARRY L. BERRY, caretaker of the Cathedral Student Desk, sells
tickets for nearly every function conceivable; from bus rides to,

football games. Berry operates a virtual information center and
says his most enjoyable duty is “socializing with the students.”

Teacher Lists Virtues

Of Chinese Language

Editor, The Pitt News,

Your news about the enroll-
students in foreign
languages is very interesting.
While there are over 900 stu-
dents taking French, 800 taking
700 taking German,

elementary Chinese class. Why?
While students are given

T credits- for taking Elementary.
Chinese but not in most of the

ether languages, there are still
only nine taking this advantage
tolearn a new language. Why?

While the students taking
Chinese are given the priority

for using the language lab and

a, betterthan average chance to
win a National Defense Act

‘ scholarship, there are still only

nine starting Chinese. Why?
There is no logical reason, but

’i there are several illogical ones:

‘Number one is the myth that
Chinese is difficult. Yes, to some
people any foreign language is
difficult. In fact, to some, even

i their own language is difficult.
But to a person with an average
. language aptitude, Chinese is not

more difficult than other lan-
guages. If Chinese were really
an .“impossible” C language, it
would not be possible to have
more people in this world using
Chinese than any other language,
including English.

‘.Number two is the myth that
Chinese is useless. This might
be true to the Americans of past
years but not now. The world is

 Letters to the Editor

so small thatleven if you are not
interested in Chinese, either the
language or the people, the Chi-

nese will somehow get into your

life and “bother” you. The vet-
erans of the Korean War wit-

nessed this. In fact, there are
a thousand ways to make your

"knowledge of Chinese language

ﬁll more constructive purposes.
You need it as a diplomat; you
need it as a newspaper reporter;

you need it as an export busi-
nessman, etc.
So, why not take Chinese?

SU "Mad Bombers"

Editor, The Pitt News,

On approaching the front en-
trance of the SU with a friend
the other day, I was bombed,
not with explosives, but with a
plastic bag. filled with filthy
water. I reported this to the
man on duty at the desk. He
told me‘ he couldn’t do anything
about it and continued his. phone
conversation.

Meanwhile, other people pass-
ing by were startled and soaked
by these “mad bombers” of

When will these little
grow up? I’m tired of

to soak people let them have

L Pseudo Salvation

 

. By Ina Aindur

There is an incorrect and rather pernicious

  

  

‘Souls Or Stamps . . . -

. rumor being criculated in this country to the effect

that America is in the midst of a religious revival.
More people are reading Norman Vincent Peale
than ever before; more people are being saved by

Billy Graham than ever before,
and for the first time in history,
green stamps are being‘ given
out for church attendance. Per-

haps the problem hinges on how 

one deﬁnes religion.

The question which we have 
before us is not whether theol- e
is a valid endeavor, not‘

whether religious belief is justi-
ﬁable, but whether the trend of
American religious belief is such
as to justify the term religious

 

revival in connection with it. Paul Tillich has de-

ﬁned religion as “ultimate concern.” Money, pres- ’

tige, or the classless society can.all be made ‘into
religious objects of devotion. One must determine
the level of the religiosity of our religious revival.
A skeptic might validly _question how many of the
constituents of modern religions are really con-
cerned about the meaning of their .lives and are

really devoted to the attainme

center for themselves.

One, must be skeptical about the religious level

,of Dr. Graham and his followers. Does a circus
tent or a football stadium, accompanied by blaring
lights and emotional music really produce an ‘at-
mosphere in which one can be “saved?” Or on the

, contrary is any kind of salvation, of peace with

oneself, more likely to come in those moments of
solitude when a man‘ wonders who he is, far away
from the lights, the singing, and the people coming
forth en masse to be saved. It would be pretenti-
ous to discuss the mechanics of salvation, especially

“lt Goes On..."

REGE, THE GRIZZLY BEAR LOVER-
The Southwest migration from Waco‘, Texas doesn’t hit
town until late Friday night, b\ut‘the1-be ax‘-etwo gun_s1ingerS
striding around the Pitt dressing rooms. The two side-kicks
aren’t really toting six-shooters, but they keep ﬂlicking their
index ﬁngers outward and, blowing air through their teeth
in a ppsssooo, ppssooo whistle-like shrill. I ’

The unlikely panhandlers are Andy Kusneski and Rege
Coustillac, the veteran linebackers on the Panther defensive
unit. “That’s the way those Baylor backs are supposed to
whiz by us,” kidded Kusneski.

“I was telling Rege, that by the time we ‘read’ their
plays, those guys are supposed to be in the endzone with a
touchdown,” Andy sighed in alarm. “So Rege and I are going

-  ~ " ‘ to get a bunch of rabbits and
,.,carry them up to the Stadium.
‘Then we’re going to let them
loose and chase them all over
the place. That’ll be good
practice; won’t it?”

When Coustillac, the
grizzly two-year letter-
man was asked to conﬁrm
the tale, he just smiled,
and said, “Yeh, ppssooo!”
I just know that it won’t
be rabbits that I’ll be
chasing on Saturday,

I would never -hurt any

defenseless little animals.

But Bears, I like to tangle

with.” -

“I saw the ﬁlm clips of
    "P * the B a y l o r — Wake Forest
game,” Rege continued, “and I don’t think that Wake Forest
was very rough. They -tackled poorly andlsloppily, and we
just don’t do that.”

  

IIIIIIIIllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII‘

 
 
   

“I don’t think that Baylor’s that rough,” Rege remarked‘

unexpectedly. Most of the Pitt coaches have been trying to
impress the players for days about how tough the Bears are.
“People say that I played a good game at Miami,” Coustil-
lac said, “but I’ll have to be twice as tough this Saturday, I
ﬁgure if (Gary) Kaltenbach and (Bob) Guzik keep those
tackles from slicing out after me like I know they can, and
Larry (Vignali) forces them to double—team him, I’ll be ﬁne,
but if they don’t, then look out.” _ .
“Those fellas in front of me are tough,” the center
linebacker says. “This whole team is good this year. We
don’t have any super-stars and no one is always beeﬁn’
in the huddle and during the Scrimmages. That’s good.”

—“I can feel it already that we’re going to be up for this
Baylor game. I ﬁgure if we can beat Baylor, then I see us
with a 4-Oirecord right away. This (Ronnie) Bull kid looked
tough in the ﬁlm, but he doesn’t run over yolﬂ, We’ve got to
score three times to win.,We have to stop Bull.” And that’s
no bull. Ppssooo! Ppssooo!

UUIIIUIIIIIIIIIUIIIIIIPIIIIIIIIIII

Both Elevens
_ Won First Tilt

The last time that a Pitt foot-
ball team beat a power from the
Southwest was in 1942, when the
Panthers dumped Southern Meth-
odist, 20-7. The sophomores who
are playing such in important
role in the l9_61 play were just
embryos or cradle-conﬁned at
that time.

Speed, supposedly, has always
been the essence of victory. “The
kids are too fast for those dumb
linemen up North,” one Texas
writer’ has written.“‘We have too
much speed and quickness.”

lands this Saturday, to "challenge
Pitt, ' and the ‘talk circulating
around the. Pitt athletic depart-
ment would make a naive visitor
think that he had stumbled onto
.a mechanic’s garage.
. . “They're Fast”

Speed-talk, speed—talk, that’s
all the fellas up there talk about.
“They’re mighty fast, mighty
fast,” Coach John Michelosen
mutters to himself, as he passes
through swinging doors.

The Baylor eireven wrecked
their Baptist brethern, Wake
Forest, 31-0, in their debut. The
Panthers are only hoping that

, they can do as well against the

Baylor ‘sect as they did against

the Methodists in ‘42. Pitt is

nonsectarian despite the claim
by many that it is atheistic,

The Pitt team studied ﬁlms of
the Baylor game on Monday and
Tuesday night to see what was in
the offering this week.’“~During the
showing of the ﬂicks in slow mo-
tion, one of the linemen cautioned
the coach who was operating the
machine.

“Put it on in slow-motion,
Coach,” he asked. “That way we
can study the plays in more de-
tail.”

Express Fools Viewer

“Ya 'damn fool,” the, Coach
barked back. “What do you think
I’m doing?” That may indicate
just how fast the Baylor express
rolls. ~

“I’just hope it rains,” Fred
Cox, the unmarried ‘mudder’
of Miami heroics laughed. “I
believe all that I hear about

’ Baylor being fast and all that,
but we’ll be ready.”

“Their receivers are fast, and
we'll just have to give them a
little more room. But I've shaken
the ill effects of the ﬂu now, and
I’d like to show them some power
on, Saturday. Remember when
that ball’s in the air, it’s just as
much ours as theirs.” '

back of the Panthers didn’t have

Baylor Better At
Track Sport, But...

by CARL DEPASQUA
Pitt Backﬁeld Coach

 

WACO, Texas--If Pitt were to duel the Baylor Bears on the
perimeter of the, Stadium gridiron on the cinderpath oval, we would
be goners, but on the thick turf we are just as formidable.

On paper Baylor looks like an Olympic track delegation, and
after watching them swamp Wake.Forest, 31-0, on_Saturday, I’m con-
vinced that their backﬁeld could.’ve scored high at, Rome in the sprint
events. They have a relay team back there that averages 10 seconds
for the,100-yard dash. -

Our task will be to see that no track fanaticsin the stand, a stop-
watch dangling over their shirts, will be able to get a clocking for
the distance. , '

Most of Baylor’s offense is predicted. on passing. This is diffi-
cult to do, but this team has done It with great success. It’s strictly

a professional style of play with lots of ﬂankers and open ends.

 In order tolhave an attack like this in college
.ball, you’ve got to be quick. They have great pass-
ing and great speed. That Ronnie Bull can run
the 100 in 9.8 seconds, Ronnie Goodwin in 9.7 and
Tommy Minter, a track star, in 9.6.

Baylor had the Southwest Conference Track
champions last year and with football talent like
theirs, gifted with such speed, I can imagine what
_ their track team must be like.

Mmter Baylor reminds me of the Baltimore Colts pro
team. Their coach, John Bridgers, is a former Colt coach, and I think
that about 35 per cent of their plays are reasonable fascimilies of the
Colt offense. .

A It is said that if Baylor has the ball for two minutes that they
can score from anywhere on theﬁeld. Bridgers will confirm this
idea without a ﬂinch of the eye.

His first unit is as good as any unit in the country. They have
great talent in the backﬁeld and at the ends. Their ,  is
quarterbacks are well-drilled and well-disciplined.
They’re kids that have practiced all summer at
their trade, working about nine months of the year.

They have two quarterbacks, Ronnie Stanley
and Bobby Ply, who completed 104 passes in 193
attempts last year. These two combined for 1,563
yards via the air routes. They have the most
spectacular offense that we’ve seen since George Izo
had a flag day at the Stadium with Notre Dame a
few years ago.

   

  

Goodwin
They remind me of Doak Walker and company back in 1947 at
Southern Methodist. ‘

Their, defense is no slouch either. They have all lettermen re-
turning, and I think that their 8-3 record last year attests to their
ﬁne defensive work as well as their ﬁne offense.

We must play 60 minute football in ordersto win. There's not a

More Says Bemis

Although no major changes
are contemplated in the soc-
cer"lineup for the game this
Saturday at Ohio University.
Coach Leo Bemis promises
that his charges will be in bet-
ter condition than for last week’s
fray.

“We’ll haveto be,” says Bemis.
“Ohio U. is always in top shape.
And they’ll be out to make it
three out of four from us.”

The C‘at booters dropped a 2-1
decision to the men from Athens,
0., last year, and Bemis’ boys may
be looking for a little revenge.
“We should’ve beaten them by at
least three goals last year. They’re
stronger now, but so are we.”

Seven Return

Ohio U. will have seven regu-
lars back from last year’s team,
including the two players who
scored the goals against Pitt. Rich
Wineland returns at inside right,
and Hasan Barraj, from Lebanon,
gives depth to the halfback spot,

The Ohioans ﬁnished second
in the Ohio Conference to Ak-
ron, a future Panther opponent,
last season. '

“Our defense held up fairly
well,” Bemis comments, “but
the boys seemed (to run out of
gas in the second half. Instead
of trying to score, we were just
kicking the ball around.”

There is a chance thatdsenior
George Harley may “kick the ball
around” awhile on the front line
Saturday. Harley impressed his
coach with a display of hustle
that was matched, by few start-
ers, and may be given a chance
to prove his mettle.

A Goalie Pleases

Bemis was also pleased by the

performance turned in by Tom

kid on the ﬁeld who will be able
to relax when he thinks a play’s
dead. Because with their speed, it
may not be.

We must contain their speed and
try to minimize the mistakes we
made in the opener. The key will
be good team defense.

I was just ready to pick the win-
ner, but the editor‘ said that’s all
the space that I have. Sorry.

Panther Harriers Seek First

Win at Kent After

As _ Pitt’s crossecountry team. was busy preparing to .
tangle with Kent State, Ohio University, and Bowling Green
in a quadrangle match this coming Saturday in Ohio, Coach 
Carl Rees wasattempting to explain his team’s poor showing

in the season’s opener against Slippery Rock. ‘ 
“I think the problem was more of a mental one than a

said the Panther
“Slippery Rock might
have had more desire to win than
our boys had. In competing
against a big school like Pitt,
Slippery Rock had everything to
gain and nothing to lose. Of
course, they had an advantage
running on their home course, but
I feel that our boys did not run
the kind of race they are able to
min.” ‘

One of the harriers Rees was
undoubtedly referring to, was Bill
Mocnik, who was one of the main
reasons why the Cats were jolted
19-40. In a time trial a week be-
fore the race, Mocnik crossed the
ﬁnish line in a four-way dead-
heat for first place.

Yet, in the Slippery Rock en-
counter, Mocnik never got start-_
ed, and ﬁnished a dismal last. “I
got a cramp,” said the sophomore,
“but I’m not trying to alibi, since
some of the others suffered the
same thing and still did all right.
Maybe we were just too cocky.”

It may well be that everyone
had his bad day together. Then
again, maybe the desire is lack-
ing, according to Rees.
