eehive closes forever

DAVE HARTMAN

News Editor

Matthew Faher showed up at the Beehive
theater and coffeehouse on Forbes Avenue yes-
terday, only to learn that he was out of a job.

Faher wasn’t the only one. _ .

The Beehive closed abruptly Monday‘ night,
and according to co—owner Steve Zumoff, the

restaurant, bar and music venue has no plans to-

reopen its Oakland location;

March Choi, an employee at the Beehive

since l992,'said the decision to close the estab-
lishment stemmed from problems between
Beehive owners — Zumoff and Scott Kramer
— and the company that owns" the building,
Oakland Real Estate. .

According to Choi, the two parties have
been negotiating a lease for the last eight

months. Choi said Beehive owners had reached

a verbal agreement with the leasing company,
but when the lease was presented to Beehive, it

' included substantial rent increases that proved

impossibly expensive. q - _

Oakland Real Estate "could not be reached
for comment last night. i

As Choi leaned against the wrought iron
railing in front of the recently gutted Beehive, a
block away protesters marched in front of
Oakland Real Estate’s offices on_ Oakland
Avenue.

 

, standing still and blocking the entrance to the

New York to Pittsburgh “because of the art
’ scene” here, said she was at the protest to let

,member of the band’ Bull Seal Collective, said

_ Sabrina Nelson, who prefers to be known as
“The Ubiquitress,” could barely be heard as she
softly chanted in protest of the real estate com-
pany._ According to Nelson and other protesters,
city police told them to follow the rules for
peaceable protests, or expect to be whisked
away in paddy wagons. » . ‘ .

Those rules, which prohibit loud noises,

building, prevented‘ the crowd of a dozen or so
artfully clad protesters K from making much
noise. --

Nelson, who said she recently moved from

people know the importance of mid-size con-

cert venues such as the Beehive. .
“People don’t have anywhere to grow

from,” she said. ’ \
Damon Griffith, who, like Nelson, is a

the Beehive was one of the few venues in the
city where smaller acts could gain recognition.

“A lot of, acts can’t fill Star Lake,” Griffith
said, referring a large. concert venue in nearby
Burgettstown, Pa. ' ‘ A

The 30-year-old Pittsburgh resident said
Bull Seal Collective was the last local show to
grace the Beehive’s stage.

Power outage shuts

A power outage Friday afternoon closed more than 20
buildings across Pitt’s campus. And although the outage
lasted only a few hours, its effects will be felt for weeks to

ity-distributing device, known as a capacitor, in Posvar
Hall failed at approximately 3:30 p.m. Friday, caus_ing,.out-
ages throughout the Schenley Quad, Towers A, B and C,

the Cathedral of Learning, Bellefield Hall, Hillman

Library and nearly a dozen other lower—campus buildings.
Service said Pitt police worked throughout the outage
to free people from elevators, to allow people out of park-

-ing garages that permit exit by a electrically-powered arm,

and to make sure the buildings were evacuated until power
was restored. .

An audit of each affected building over the nextfew
months will assess whether the outage caused damage to

electrical components of the buildings. Service said that

while this audit will require the electricity to be turned off
while workers service the equipment, the planned outages
shouldn’t last more than a few hours. ’

‘ Power was restored to the campus by 9 p.m. Friday.

Cumpie’s Restaurant and Lounge offered
drink specials on Mother’s Day night. But the
plastic pitchers 'weren’t pulled down from

above the bar to toast moms. Cumpie’s was.

celebrating its reopening after being shut down
for 10 days. .

The closure was the ‘result of a raid almost
a year ago. during which police cited 45 under-
age drinkers. ‘ - ' ,

Jon Genaro, co-owner of Cumpie’s, can
often be'seen standing on the corner watching
the streets, his white apron blending with his
white hair‘ and white hat.

Inside the bar, a few men have stopped for
a, drink on their way home from work. They
lean over their ‘glasses on the 'copper—covered
bar top, trying to_talk to women. As the sun
sets the workers‘ leave the bar to walk home,

  reopens after
raid forces 10-day closure

and‘ college students begin to take their seats at
the bar.

The owners of Cumpie’s like their reputa-
tion around Oakland and are confident of their

-popularity among Pitt students.

“We. treat kids real nice,” said co—owner
Sam Rende. “Take a poll on the students.”

But Cumpie’s has experienced continuing
problems with the Pennsylvania Liquor
Control Board, eventually leading to the bar’s

‘temporary closure last week.

“They’ve got laws I’ve never heard of,”
Genaro said, referring to the LCB. “They make
the laws for themselves, not the citizens.”

Genaro said the penalties levied against
Cumpie’s, combined with legal fees and the

bar’s 10-day closure, cost the establishment‘
' $67,000.. L

“They pick on me constantly  we run a
clean bar,” said Genaro, whose establishment

Derailing democracy

ERIK MEUSER
Staff Writer

The University Honors College
presented David Broder, syndicated
columnist for The New York Times and
The Washington Post,‘ as part of its
American Experience Lecture Series in
Benedum Hall last night.

_ Broder’s lecture, “Democracy
Derailed,” which is also the title of his
latest book, focused on what he
believes is the breakdown of the
American electoral system.

According to Broder, one of the

major problems with the American vot- .

ing system is that the entire election
system is seriously underfunded. This
lack of funds stretches far beyond
being able to purchase new machinery
that would make the physical process
of voting more uniform. It also includes
being able to pay people to be on the

instruct voters on how the voting booth
works and how to read their ballots.
According to Broder, there is currently
not enough money or time to help train
those who do this work.

The majority of Broder’s hour-and-
a-half lecture» focused putting initia-
tives on ballots, something that is com-
mon in California and Oregon. An ini-
tiative is an issue that would normally
be brought up in the state senate and
passed by representatives, but instead is
put up for public vote by the state leg-
islature. While this may seem as though
it is a more direct form of democracy
because voters rather than politicians
make the decisions that affect their
local community, Broder said he
believes initiatives can be deceiving.

“People who are able to garner any
initiative support are those who are
either independently wealthy or busi-
nesses,” hesaid.

Broder said that many times the

While voters may believe they are
voting on a single subject, such as pro-
viding more tax money for the
improvement of roads, the initiative
may also include the improvement of
sidewalks and the purchasing of new
equipment. According to Broder, multi-
ple issues on an initiative make it diffi-

cult to determine the actual desires of

the voters.

from urban areas where those who
make the decision to pass the initiative

While Broder expressed concern 9
about including initiatives on the ba1- _

the initiative process is ridiculous, and
any effort to modify it would be diffi-

that location ever again. Although the A lot of students were attracted to
reasons are unclear at the moment, one the Beehive as a place to go for con-

can be assured that anyone who wants
to visit a Beehive will now have to
venture to Carson Street on the South
Side.

This is a grave loss for Oakland, as
the Beehive joins CJ. Barney’s as yet
another college hangout closed with-
out notice. '

The face of Oakland is changing,
and not necessarily for the better. With
C.J. Bamey’s and the Beehive now out
of business, Oakland is losing the col-
lege town atmosphere that has made it
such a great place to be. Those two
establishments were places that —
although they may not have appealed

to everyone — were unique. How

often do you ﬁnd a place like the
Beehive or CJ. Barney’s without a
major college or university nearby?

A college town always has its own
ﬂair. Even when the college town is sit-
uated in the middle of nowhere, like
State College, there is still a certain feel
that cannot be replicated anywhere.
Oakland ‘is losing that feel, and the

certs. For example, Nelly Furtado per-
formed there in April. As it was, the
Beehive and Club Laga were the only

- medium-sized venues in Oakland.

Now there is only one, which indicates
fewer concerts will be coming.

Some students already complain
that there is not enough to do in
Oakland. Students will now have to
travel even further to see some musical
acts or just have a place to hang out

But the Beehive was not just a
wonderful place for concerts; it was
also a unique coffeehouse. Whether its
crowd was your scene or not," it cer-
tainly diﬁered from the norm.

Where else could you go if you
wanted to wear your spiked collar?
Where else could you sit out on a patio
and look at the diﬁferent types of
passersby that meander down Forbes
Avenue?

Sadly, the Beehive is now gone.
We hope that something‘ just as quirky
will take its place and will help
Oakland keep its college town ﬂavor.

made an appearance on “Politically Incorrect”
earlier this year, theygwere met with a bitter and
abusive Rep. Maxine ' Waters (D-Calif.), who
assured the studio and home audiences that,
although Al Gore lost the election, Democrats in
Congress were going to ﬁght vigorously against
Republican attempts to ‘undo the progress of the
Clinton Era . C

\Vrth that she turned to Nader
and said, “And Ralph, you better ‘
stay out of our way.” ’

Ah, the Clinton Era. A time
of ' unprecedented prosperity
brought on by a signiﬁcant reduc- -

JEFF

, tion in crime, a skyrocketing stock marketand a

balanced budget. Everything conservative
Republicans could have asked for and more.

Unfortunately the honorable and often
deluded Waters failed to mention the price paid.
for these “accomplishments.”

We now have a prison population of two
million inmates, approximately twice the num-
ber incarcerated when Bill Clinton took office.
An overwhelming majority of the added prison-
ers have been convicted of drug crimes. They are
disproportionately -black and Hispanic and
almost always front impoverished inner city
communities. It is undeniably clear that the first

“black” president put minorities ﬁrst in line to 

be locked up, that‘is. 3. .. .

Clinton did have one prosperous and grate-
ful constituency‘: corporate America. Ratifying
the North American Free Trade Agreement,
reducing the capital gains tax and granting Most
Favored Nation trading status to China are just a
few examples of how Clinton became, or per-
haps simply always was, a tool of the corporate
oligarchy.

For the tens of thousands of jobslost in man- ,

ufacturing in Detroit and elsewhere across the
country thanks to NAFTA, we were told to
expect better labor conditions and pay for
Mexican workers. Well, the average wage in

Mexico has dropped from $1.10 an hourto $0.90 '

an hour, and pollution from American factories
on the Mexican side of the border has doubled
the amount of air pollution in the vicinity since

Millions of Americans will be booted ﬁom
welfare rolls this year as another conservative tri-
umph, welfare reform, takes effect This was yet
another cause championed by Clinton and his
Republican allies in Congress, yet
another disaster passed on to his
successor.

Herein lies my response to
Watersf If Nader is the enemy of
_ progressives, what, by God, do you
think Clinton was?

IfA1 Gore’s qualiﬁcations for the presiden-
cy were that of his eight years playing a support-
ing role to Clinton, the record shows he had
failed miserably as a progressive. If Gore was his

_“own man” and could be separated ﬁom
Clinton’s legacy, he then had no qualiﬁcations to ’

nm as aprogressive candidate except for a sin-

_ gle, not to mention poorly written, book on the

environment.

“What about hisyears of service in the .

referring to years Gore spent as a centrist (con-

the closeness‘ of the election left a sour taste. in
their mouths, but "what else can you expect when
you’ve got an acidic yellow fruit jammed

Apparently, at least according to Waters and
other bitter and breaﬂiless‘ Democrats, the best
course of action to take in such a situation is to
refuse the help of the Good Samaritantrying to

Criminals: Live from Mars
Ben Harper and the Innocent.

if

BRIAN KLUCHUROSKY

Staff Writer

Ever get thatfeeling of deja -vu? You
know, you could have sworn whatever it is
you’re experiencing has already
happened before. That’s exact-
ly the feeling I get when I 
listen to the latest from Ben I
Harper and the Innocent 
Criminals, a live double -disc?
that includes 'both acoustic and
electric shows. _

Harper and the Criminals’ Live from Mars '
could be called Double, Triple and Quadruple g
Takes Live from Mars. Everysong sounds like
the one, two or four songs before it. As a
result, I’m truly indebted to _track numbers. _

Thereis somewhat of an upside though.
Ben Harper plays music well. enough that,
despite the redundancy, you can’t bring your-
self to shut him off. It’s kind of like any
action movie from the ‘80s shown regularly
on TNT or TBS — if you’ve seen one, you’ve
seen them all. Yet I always have trouble

 

changing the channel because, and I admit
this shamelessly, they’re actually pretty
entertaining. .

If anything saves this album, it is
Harper’s smooth and insightful melodies. His
songs are full of substance and emotion,
somewhat of a lost art in today’s music indus-
try. ' l f

Harper’s electric show, aided by the
Innocent Criminals, sets a light and jumpy
tone with “Guilty and Consequence.” Harper
goes on to belt out a somewhat decent version
of Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing,” one of

’ the only songs of the electric performance to

‘demonstrate any real diversity. He rounds out

the show with “Burn One Down,” a song

familiar to Harper fans, as well as “Welcome
to the Cruel World.”

The acoustic show, thebetter of the two,

is» almost trance-like. I don’t think I’ve ever

zoned out to abstract thoughts of nothing

‘ as much as I did listening to this

voice and simple riffs create
a very peaceful and relaxed
V state. The show is highlight-
ed by the songs, “Waiting on
an Angel,” ‘5Pleasure and Pain”
and “Another Lonely Day,” probably the best
song of the whole album.
, Die—hard fans of Ben Harper and the
Innocent Criminals should not be disappoint-
ed with this double CD. For those who are not
die-hard fans, what type of person you are

 

will determine whether Live from Mars is

good or not. ' - 4

As summer descends upon us, so do the
things common to this sweltering sea-
son: longer days, more free time,
swimming pools, vacation, and for
many students, a summer job.

My summer jobs in the past have
been pretty tame. I worked as a recep-
tionist in a doctor’s ofﬁce for two subse-
quent summers. Last summer, I
worked as a nanny for three chil-
 ..   ..  dren, where my duties included
Leslie Hoff,-nan preparing ramen noodles and peanut

. ' butter and jelly sandwiches for

A&E Edltor lunch, monitoring television watch-
ing and sitting by the community pool.

But this summer, I find myself in a most interesting posi-
tion. V .
In the course of the last week I have suddenly been thrust
into the throes of a job as a salesgirl at what is perhaps the
world’s most popular lingerie store.

This store’s name is so synonymous with sex -and sexi-
ness that I’m sure I don’t even need to reveal its all too preva-
lent name; you’re all familiar with the seductive catalogue
and the revealing television commercials featuring slender yet
impossibly curvy models rolling around in bras and panties
and talking about love in foreign accents, through which we
subconsciously learn: Lingerie plus store in commercial
equals love.

Had someone asked me even a week and a half ago if I
could have pictured myself working at this particular place, I
would have laughed." _ ~

Why, you ask? Why would I have scoffed at the idea of
hawking lacy bras and panties while surrounded by the
world’s pinkest interior design ever?

While I have often found great joy in purchasing under-
wear, I have also often found great embarrassment in asking
for help in purchasing it. ‘

i The first time I ever had to purchase a bra, I wouldn't
even let my mother tell the salesgirl why we were in the store.

Even now, as I search for my on-the-smaller—side size, I
blushwhen salesgirls ask, “Can I be of any assistance?” or
even worse, “Can I interest you in a free bra ﬁtting today?”

Thank you, no. I know my own size.

I also cringe at the thought of pushing merchandise on
women who don’t need to add to their credit card debt and
men who are too intimidated by the estrogen-rich environ-
ment to say “no” to additional purchases.

Now the tables have suddenly turned, and I am the shiny,
smiling salesgirl in a sleek black suit who holds the keys to
the dressing room, who can whip out a pink-and—white tape
measure at whim to provide free bra ﬁttings, and who knows
the corporation’s “evil” secrets to selling our newest bra,
which happens to be a part of the “Very Sexy” collection —
as opposed to all of the other underwear in the store, which by
comparison is merely sexy.

I am suddenly the cool, chic keeper of the plush women’s
realm and this responsibility concerns me. Can I conform?
Can I really inﬂuence people to purchase the panties that
match the bra that matches the nightgown that complements
the pleasing ﬂoral fragrance?

Can I truly “sell my heart out” — as the head sales repre-
sentative on the training video implored new employees to
do? »

Or better yet, can I do it without selling my heart out?

“The Plantation”
Chris Kuzneski

Writer’s Showcase

iii

MARGARET EMERY
Staff Writer H 5

\

One of the nice things. about Chris

Kuzneski’s “The Plantation” is the humor.‘For a A

book marketed "as a gory thriller about a group of
black men taking revenge on history by
abducting whites for a reverse planta-
tion, the mood of the story is kept 
light.    .-
The dialogue, pop culture ref— P V
erences and somewhat ridiculous
scenarios prevent the story from ‘
probing too deep into slavery or politi- ,
cal correctness, but for the most part, the racial

T issues that cloud the plot are dealt with diplo-

matically. _ ,

Kuzneski, who graduated‘ from Pitt with a
degree in writing and a master’s in teaching, is a
master of dialogue. P

So much in fact, that the book could easily
be reworked as a script with little effort. The
dialogue is always funny, every character sounds
different, all the dialects are accurate and

 

A.

although there’s a lot of it, the dialogue always

moves the story along. ,

When an elite group of black men abduct a
group of "whites to be sold into slavery in Africa,
they capture the protagonist’s girlfriend. When
the main character and his best friend get caught
while trying to rescue her, they start singing Bob
Marley songs. Their panicked joking uninten-
tionally makes the scenemore powerful.

The reader also learns a lot about torture on
plantations: cutting off fingers, nailing ears to a
pole, public humiliation and rape are some of the
more expected hardships. The other aspects of
plantations that the book sheds light on include
dehydration, lack of medical care and long work
days.

There were some glitches in the story, but the

joking makes it difficult to decide whether or not '

the holes are intentional. In one of the first chap-
ters two complete pages of dialogue are punctu-

ated with exclamation points.- This bout of .

excessive punctuation occurs not when
the characters are dodging bullets or
saving tortured victims, but when
the main characters are at work.
There’s also a chapter where one
of the villains says, “You’ll pay for
that with your lives.” Then, on the next
page the main character says, “They’ll pay for
that with their lives.” Paying for things with
lives becomes a catch phrase. A torturer urinates
on someone and the captive thinks, “He’ll pay
for that with his life.”

An annoying male viewpoint also pervades
the novel. Plantation owners objectify everyone,
not just women, and the main character’s girl-
friend is built like a comic book character, but

 

with brains. The almost cinematic strip club

 PAUL ’

Sports Editor

Pitt baseball, a team marred by injuries
and inexperience, ﬁnished in last place in

the Big East, dropping nine of its ﬁnal 11
‘games. The Panthers’ (18-27 overall, 6-18

in conference) last-place ﬁnish kept the
team from making the Big - East

Rutgers 4, Pitt 0; Pitt 8, Rutgers 0

While many students ﬁnished their

ﬁnals, the baseball team traveled to New
Jersey on April 28, where the team split a
doubleheader.

In the ﬁrst game, Pitt’s batters hit safe-
ly on just two occasions as Rutgers pitcher
Bobby Brownlie allowed only a couple of
singles. Brownlie dominated by pitching a
complete game and striking out 10

Brownlie got all the run support that
he needed when Pitt shortstop Bryan
Spamer booted a Val Majewski grounder.
After knocking off of Spamer, the ball
found itsway into the outﬁeld, allowing
Rutgers center ﬁelder Brian Ciemnicki to
score from ﬁrst base.

Already leading 3-0, another Pitt error,
this time made by second baseman Scott
Folrnar, allowed Rutgers to score its fourth
and ﬁnal run. _

Pitt’s bats woke up in game two, and
Joe Engel pitched a complete game
shutout as the Panthers won 8-0.

Engel, who led the team in with ﬁve.
wins, 69 strikeouts and 70 1/3 innings
pitched, gave up just seven hits while strik-
ing out eight batters in nine innings of
work. -. _ - J

Pitt jumped on top early, scoring three
nms in the ﬁrst inning thanks to RBI sin-

gles by Brad Rea, Rolando Bello and -

Darren Lenhart. A two—nm homer by Chris
Papst in the third added to Engel’s cushion,
and Lenhart blew the game wide open in
the the sixth inning with a two-rim single
up the middle.

Rutgers 6, Pitt 0

Pitt 2, Providence 0; Providence 7, Pitt 1
Coming down the stretch of the season,

the Panthers’ bats came alive, as Bell and

game.The_Eagles managed just two hits off

nine hits. Robert Morris got oﬁ” to a quick,2-
0 lead, but Pitt answered with three runs of
its own in the second inning, including a
Tiffany Barrett homerun. '

Villanova pitching gave up two hits in
two game_s en route to a doubleheader
sweep of Pitt, improving its record to an
impressive 40-8.

games. In game one Theresa Homick went
the distance, pitching seven innings and sur-
rendering just two hits and an earned rim.

single to score Steidle from third base in the
top of the third inning. The Wildcats
answered quickly in the bottom half, tying
the game via a Sara Carlson RBI single.

doubleheader at Rutgers on May 6.

Rutgers bats. Gasti (7-17) gave up six runs
(ﬁve earned) and eight hits in 4.1 innings of
action. I

A Gasti wild pitch allowed Brittney
Neer to score and gave Rutgers a 1-0 lead.

ﬂed Pitt’s batters, allowing just four hits in
the game. Koehler got the win.

Rea. Papst kept the rally going with a sin-

gle to third, which plated Bello and cut the
lead to 3-2. - .
That was as close as the Panthers

would get as Villanova posted three more 5

runs in the ﬁfth, expanding the margin

‘between the two teams to four runs.

Villanova 5, Pitt 1; Villanova 15, Pitt 10

Pitt dropped both sides _of a double-
header . to concede the sweep to ' the
Wildcats. In the ﬁrsthalf of the double dip-

per, the Panthers dropped to Villanova 5-1

despite a strongpitching performance from
Engel.
Engel pitched a complete game,

spreading out seven hits and giving up only

two earned runs while striking out six. But
it was Engel’s adversary, Bob Grzenda,

who picked up the win for the Wildcats.

Grzenda shut down Pitt’s lineup, giv-
ing up just four hits and a run, pitching the

' entire game.

Pitt’s‘ lone run came via a Colamarino
solo home nm. '

 In the nightcap, Pitt outhit Villanova
15-12, yet the team failed to manufacture
enough runs. Bamyak picked up the loss
for the Panthers, giving up eight hits and
eight runs in four innings. ,

Rea and Colamarino continued to
thrive in the defeat Colamarino doubled
twice and Rea, who led the team: with 12

home runs and 49 RBIs, had two hits in the

loss. Rea also scoredtthree times.

Akron 3, Pitt 2 -

After having its May 8 contest wiﬂr
Duquesne canceled, Pitt traveled to Akron,
and despite solid pitching, the team
dropped its seventh consecutive game.

Greg Paul pitched a complete ' game

for the Panthers in the loss, giving up six

hits and two earned runs while fanning six
batters. ‘ _

The Panthers continued to shoot them-
selves in the foot by committing errors, and
they lost once again because of rniscues in
the ﬁeld. ' - ,

With the game" tied at two, Ty
Moorehead bunted his way. on base fora
single. Steve Bowers sacriﬁced
Moorehead over to second base, and when

Moorehead saw that there was no one in
position _to make a play at third, he kept
going. Colamarino’s bad throw from ﬁrst
base soared out of play, allowing
Moorehead to score the garne—winning
run. .
It was a cumulative effort for the
Akron pitching staif, as six pitchers per-
formed on the mound in the victory.

Pitt 4, Virginia Tech 1; Pitt 4, Virginia
Tech 1 p » '
Pitt put an end to its seven-game slide
by sweeping Virginia Tech in a double-
header with the assistance of great pitching

I performances from Rhoten and Engel.

In_ game one, Rhoten recorded his ﬁrst
career complete game, scattering ﬁve hits
and striking out ﬁve Hokies.

Pitt broke a 1-1 tie in the bottom of the
ﬁfth when Rea hit a deep ﬂy ball to right
ﬁeld, which scored Lenhart The Panthers
manufactures two more runs in the sixth
inning after Folmar and Sparner hit sacri-
ﬁces for RBIs.

I S Colamarino led Pit with three hits on
the day. '

EngeL whoﬁnished the season with

6

an impressive 1.92 ERA, pitched a com-
plete game in the second game, giving up
eight hits and striking out six.

For the second consecutive game, Pitt 8

trailed 1-0 after one inning but tacked on
two runs in the third inning, with the help
of a Lenhart two-run single. Pitt never
looked back, as Ackerman and Papst added

RBIs.

Virginia Tech 5, Pitt 3

The season ﬁnale was reminiscent of
the season as Pitt rallied for three runs in
the bottom of the ninth but came up short
in the attempt, ﬁnishing with a record of
18-27.

' Hokie pitcher Ian Ostlund took a
shutout into the ninth inning but couldn’t
complete the game after he surrendered a
leadoif triple to Bello and a hard RBI sin-
gle to Lenhart Ostlund was pulled after
giving up another single to Colamarino.

~ Anthony Miller came on in relief and
immediately gave up two consecutive RBI
singles, one to Rea and one to Britt. Vtrrth
the lead reduced to 5-3, Miller settled
down and forced pinch hitter Dan
Troppman to ground into a double play.
