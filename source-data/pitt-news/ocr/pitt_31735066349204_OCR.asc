 Joint Economic Plan

    Urged by Kissinger

BY BILL MOORE

Joint solutions to the world’s
economic problems should be
sought by the United States and
European powers at the upcoming
economic summit, Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger said last
night in downtown Pittsburgh.

,3‘, In‘ a speech sponsored by the

World Affairs Council, Kissinger
termed present poverty and unem-
ployment intolerable, and outlined
a need for cooperation among the
heads of Great Britain, West
Germany, France, Italy, Japan and
the United States at their economic

-conference planned for Saturday.
“Economic issues are now a p

central dimension of international
politics,” Kissinger said. “New
and de-

over energy, food, raw materials
and rules for the exploitation of
ocean resources.”

/.r*"‘y Kissinger told the large crowd in

the Hilton Hotel that ,inter-depen-
dence among nations rules out
success in economic recovery if
nations maintain a policy of
isolation.

“Cooperation among the indus-
trial nations is also essential if we
are to achieve greater self-suffi-
ciency and less vulnerabilitylin
energy, if we are to maintain and
expand the world’s markets and
supplies of food, and if we are to
ensure adequate supplies and
market-stability ‘for other vital raw
materials.”

A special responsibility lies with
the United States, he continued,

'Lf_°""**§.=:cause it is the world’s largest
“and most dynamic economy.

Kissinger said industrial demo-
cracies should not be dependent on
oil-producing powers. He lauded
effortslaunched in 1973 to ﬁnd
alternative sources of energy.

‘ ‘We have undertaken to develop
alternative sources of energy by
removing legal obstacles to explor-

. ation and production, by measures
to sustain or guarantee return of
investment, and by research and

Of Admission

 Procedures

BY TOMMIE NELL TAYLOR
Pitt admissions’ procedures
will be reviewed in two weeks,
according to CAS Dean .Robert
Marshall.
“The CAS council has the
responsibility of acting as an

admission review committee,"
Marshall said at a council meeting
Tuesday.

The committee will consider ﬁve
areas related to admissions—the
number of admissions, criteria for
admissions, eligibility of transfer
students, the effectiveness of the

*{_;University Community for Educa-

tion Programs (UCEP), and the
status of part-time students. _

G9ct€imd'on Page 3)‘

development on a large scale,” he
said.

Continuing those policies and
expanding the pursuit of oil
independence will be stressed by
the United States as long-term
goals (if the countries at the
summit, Kissinger said.

Rising food prices in America
and throughout the world, he

“stated, raise the danger of chronic

food shortages and possible famine
in poorer countries.

He claimed the summit will
provide the opportunity to advance
mutually beneﬁcial programs aim-
ed at alleviating the economic
problems for all countries.

Platt Demands $5,00 Return

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The University should return
$5,000 earned by the investment of
student activities fees to the
Student Government (SG), SG
President Larry Platt said at
Monday’s Senate Council meeting.

The demand came following
seven months of investigation by
the Ofﬁce of Business and Finance
sparked by inquiries made by an
allocations committee member.

“Joe Dutton (vice chancellor for
Business and Finance) researched
and researched and researched,”
Platt said. 'T‘Now we have the
chancellor agreeing to research the
matter.” 

“The reason we want this money
(estimated at $5,000) is that the

buying power of the activities fee

has been steadily decreasing.

America has always embodied,” Secretary of "State Henry Kissinger

said, speaking in downtown Pittsburghlast night.

  ‘Youth Must Change,’

BY BILL MOORE

America's youth, both black and
white, have had ‘a “fantastic
burden" placed on their shoulders
- by their parents’ generation, black

comedian-turned-activist Dick Gre-
gory told an overﬂow crowd in the
SU ballroom Monday.

Speaking as part of the Sixth 5

Annual Black week, Gregory
appealed to the young audience to
abandon hatred and radically
change society.

“Somewhere along the line, you
young people are going to have to
turn t is system around,” the
44-year-old Gregory said. “The
very faith and destiny of the
country depends on you.”
Universities, Gregory said, are
shirking their primary duty by only
teaching students howto get jobs.
“You are going to have to tell"

tions that they exist to serve

' you—you don’t exist to serve them.
'_ They are here to educate you, not
: indoctrinate you."

He advised the student audience
to worry less about grades and

-2 more about people, punctuating his

point by humorously describing a

‘ graduate trying to pay for groceries

with" his college transcript.
“Transcripts don’t mean shit at

‘ Safeway Market,” he said.

‘ _"Every day students walk by 30
people without speaking a word, all
to go to the libraryand read adead

 

. University revenue, ’ ’

these so-called educational inst1tu- .

We’ve been thinking about increas-
ing the activities fee, but right now
we're looking for innovative ways
to stretch the money we have.” .
According to Dutton, whose
office is responsible for maintain-
ing the activities fee, University

- reluctance on returning the interest

gained by short-term investment of
the fee hinges on the use of the
money thus derived.

‘.‘We invest all of our money,
even if it’ll only make us four

bucks, and 'it works to the
advantage of everyone in the
University.’ ’

According to Dutton, the Univer-
sity includes money generated by
short-term investment in the
budget reviewed by the State. Like
all income, this revenue is used to
offset expenses. '

The money generated this ‘way,
by investing accounts “not dissimi-
lar” to the activities fee» account,
amounts to “millions,” Dutton
said.

“It’s not a question of what it
willdo to $5,000, but what would
happen to the millions,” he said.

“While Student Government has
many capable people, we have
many others who have" hustled to
get grants and gifts to remodel
their ofﬁces. Now if they have to
wait two years before they use that
money, what am I going to do?
Parcel out the interest to them?”

The money generated through
short-terminvestment is critical to
the management flexibility of the
institution, Dutton said, and also
contributes to lower costs for
students.

Platt contends the threat to the
general University income from

— more groups demanding the return

of their interest was irrelevant to
the issue of the interest from
student activity fees.

“I’m not aware of all the types of
Platt said,
“because I don’t have the level-one

(Continued on -Page 2)

book," Gregory complained. “Un-
iversities should teach alittle less
math and trigonometry and a little
more about integrity, honesty and
ethics."

The dynamic speaker accused
"universities of admitting black
students as a means of obtaining
federal aid, but then failing to

educate them and in many ‘cases
graduate them.

Gregory harshly criticized Presi-
dent Gerald Ford’s handling of the
New York City ﬁnancial crisis,
charging Ford’s lack of action was
because New York is populated
.mainly with blacks and Jews.

“People debate whether we
would give money to New York

City. Well, when they got ready to 

bandroll Lockheed, they didn't ask
your opinion about that. When they
helped Penn Central, they didn't
ask you about that». If Mellon Bank
gets in trouble, they'll help them.

“Ford is the same president who .
was begging for a billion dollars to ‘

aid Saigon 10 days before the North
Vietnamese took control. This is
the‘ dude who won ’t‘help New-York.

J Safety Plans  

Implemented  

In Scaife Hall    f

BY NORM MARTELLO

Additional security measures in

Scaife Hall have been implemented
recently, according to Vice Chan-
cellor of the Health Professions
Nathan J. Stark.
“Safe working and studying

conditions for faculty, staff and
students who~use Scaife Hall at

hours other than normal are of 

utmost importance, ’ ’ Stark said.

“These measures were designed ' "Q «
inconvenience to‘

with minimal
those using Scaife Hall.”

' Employes, faculty and students ,

can go to and from Presbyterian‘-

Hospital and the Eye and ‘Ear

Hospital through Scaife Hall.
Security aids have been used at
the main entrance on Terrace .
Street for a few years, according "to
Campus Police Chief Curt Graham.
Additional security includes

- locking the fourth-ﬂoor Terrace

Street entrance during off-hours.
Passage is permitted to -those with
Presyterian
Hospital or Eye and Ear Hospital
I.D. ‘ _
Even with the added regulations,
a Campus Police spokesman said,

it’s difﬁcult to keep people out of .

the building. He also said that

using the second-floor De Soto
Street entrance as a checkpoint
would allow students access to the‘
library while limiting direct access
to interconnecting Presbyterian
Hospital, thus increasing security.‘

“The dialogue between the
industrial and the developing
countries is of crucial importance to
the building of international
order,” he maintained. _

“After a decade of war, two
years of constitutional crisis and an
uncertain period of domestic

gr recession, there are those who
doubt either the wisdom of further

involvement abroad or even our
moral right to lead,’-’ Kissinger
continued. “But this cannot be the
view of the great majority of the

_ American people.

all the optimism and confidence

that America has always embodied:
It needs our strong faith as a

source of hope to others that the

fee differs from normal fees both in
purpose and management,

“Because the fee is collected
solely for extracurricular activities
and is managed and distributed by
students, it is distinct from other
University accounts," Platt ar-
gued.

Dutton also raised the question
of the cost to the University for
managing the activities fee ac-
count, for which the interest

. provides some remuneration. Platt

claimed, however‘, the'cost was
negligible.

“The functions which would
incur cost, Dutton told me, were

A Solid Power Base

When a student leader devotes most of his answers at a news
conference to the question of student support, the way Student
Government Board (SGB) President Lariy Platt did Friday, many might
believe he's trying to shift the blame away from his own poor

leadership.

This is not the case with Platt, and if students think it is, then
perhaps they're to do a little face-saving of their own.
The reason renewed calls for student support merely sound like more
of the same thing is that that’s what they are——-more of the same thing.
And it’s more of the same thing because time and time again when

A student leaders need that’ extra leverage to exert pressure on an.
‘administrator, students fail to oorne through. -

Unlike the Board that preceded it, the Platt administration has mad
at  effort_ in seeking out and formulating solutions for student
problems. Though several individual Board members haven’t lived up
to their responsibilities, the overall work of the Board has been

substantial.

Why, then, don’t the great majority of students actively join together
to nuke their leaders more effective? Frankly, we don’tjknow.
However, two observations can be made on the current situation of

leaders without a power base.

First, there is practically no student attendance at SGB meetings
other than by student representatives of groups on the agenda.

And second, special interest groups act strongly only for special )
interests. Examples of this are the lnterfraternity Council’s sharp
response to the football-coupon system, the Black Action Society’s
physical protest last year at the chancellor’s ofﬁce when its candidate
for Black Studies chairman was rejected, and the Resident Student

 -Association’s reply to the imposition of the escort security policy and
- - the removal of the Towers-pinball  .
. - Had these groups and others like them spoken up for their members
" during the tuition hike, perhaps the outcome would have been A

I different.

 ~ But the prevailing attitude, at least from these two indications, is
   that fraternity and sorority members believe the IFC is only for Greek
issues, that blacks believe the BAS is only for black issues, and that
residents believe the RSA is only for residents’ issues.
A more efficient way to build a solid power base would be through.
‘small blocs drawing support from distinct campus groups, which would

solidly back the SGB.

This would be the same as the political nominating conventions
during an election year. A delegate casts a ballot through his state; the
state’s votes are then apportioned to national candidates.

There are no dynamic formulas for an organized power bloc of

_students. But if support can be elicited ﬁrst in small groups, and then

on a mass level, there's at least a chance for greater participation in
student government and greater inﬂuence in University affairs.

Snooped by the FBI

Dissenters Take the Stand

BY BILL KALMAN

The revelations emanating from
“Watergate” and -beyond have
disclosed enough secret operations
to demonstrate the contempt with
which the government has regard-
ed the Bill of Rights. But the
nation has had as yet only a
glimpse of the government's vast
and, for the most part, still secret
store of Watergate-style opera-
tions. ,

In an attempt to uncover the rest

of‘ these illegal government activi- ~

ties and to dismantle them, a
far-reaching lawsuit against
itichard Nixon and many of those
involved in the Watergate sandal
was ﬁled on July 18, 1973, by
attorney Leonard Boudin on behalf
of the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP) and the Young Socialist
Alliance. (YSA). In addition, a
Political Rights Defense Fund
(PRDF) was formed to ﬁnance and
publicize the legal action.

The Senate Watergate hearings
neglected a whole area of illegal
government operations—against
the antiwar movement, radicals

and socialists, the labor militants, -
' black groups and other dissenters.

Government inﬁltrators and
agents provoked violence during
antiwar demonstrations. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. was the
target, of vicious’ government
slanders, and the government
waged a murderous campaign
againstthe Black Panther Party.
The United Farm Workers Union

has been a victim of government .

hostility since its inception, when
the Pentagon deliberately bought
tons of scab grapes to. demonstrate
its alliance with the growers.

In a 1968 FBI “Counterintelli-
gence Program,” COINTELPRO,
made public in early 1974, J. Edgar

' Hoover declared that the FBI’s

purpose was “to expose, disrupt

The Students’ Right to Know

Board member, I was planning to

attend. This did not sit well with,

him. He told me that I could not

attend and would be barred from ,

‘his office (where the meeting was
to be held)_if I showed up. Not
wanting to take the sole responsi-
bility for any such incident, he
consulted with several other key
administration officials on this
matter, up to and including the
chancellor. Their decision was
unanimous; it was too risky to
chance my attendance. Only_a few
hours before the brieﬁng was
scheduled to convene, it was
mysteriously canceled.

Two major issues I raised while
running for Student Government
Board last January were support to
faculty, staff, andstudent unioni-
zation efforts and opposition to
secret meetings with the adminis-
tration. I stand opposed to deals
and negotiations carried out behind
the backs of the student body. The
administration, from Markus up
through the chancellor, know that I
couldn’t be “trusted" to attend, _

Instead of secret meetings which
"hide information from the student
body, all meetings should be
widely publicized and held at a
time and in, a place easily
accessible to interested persons.

It is the practice of the Pitt News
to report on the proceedings of the
weekly Student Government meet-
iiigs. At its meeting two weeks ago,
the Board had a discussion in which
the sentiment was clearly opposed
to the administration’s maneuvers.

' Yet. not one word of this incident

appeared in the Pitt News. The Pitt
News is a student newspaper. Its
primary responsibility should be to
give an accurate account of events
that affect the lives of students. not
to keep incidents hidden from

public View that the administration '

would rather have hushed up.

’ ized.”

and otherwise neutralize the
activities of the various New Left
organizations, their leadership and
adherents...They must not only be
contained, but must be neutral-
A recent and successful
lawsuit by Washington-based
NBC-TV reporter Carl Stern forced
the release of the COINTELPRO
document, which acknowledged
several other disruption plans.
COINTELPRO was a precursor of
the notorious‘ 1970 “Domestic
Intelligence Gathering _Plan” de-
vised by Nixon aide Tom Charles
Huston and exposed by former
White House Counsel John Dean in
the early days of the Watergate
hearings. . 9
Senator Sam Ervin called the
Huston Plan the product of a

- ,»x
,,

“Gestapo mentality.” Huston
himself conceded that it was
“clearly illegal and highly risky."
It intensiﬁed and codiﬁed uncon-
stitutional government harassment
against protest organizations.
There are 'still many unanswered
questions. For example: What is
the link between, COINTELPRO’s
instructions to “neutralize” pro-
testers and the murders of King,
Malcolm X, Fred Hampton and the
students at Kent State and Jackson
State? How many more clandes-

tine COINTELPROS are still
operational?
In the SWP/YSA suit, the

plaintiffs charge Nixon, govern-
ment agency heads and several
former Nixon associates‘ with a
“systematic campaign of excessive
interrogation, employment dis-
crimination . . .warrantless electron-
ic surveillance, unauthorized open-
ing and monitoring 7 of mail,
burglary and other illegal means.”

The complaint seeks a perma-
nent injunction “restraining the-
defendants, their agents and
successors” from wiretapping,
monitoring mail, infiltrating and
breaking into party headquarters
and implementing any aspect of the
1970 Huston plan and other such
illegal plans. -

In its ‘ﬁrst reply to the suit, in
January, 1974, -the government
admitted it conducted electronic
surveillance of SWP members from
1945 to 1963 ‘and an

1969, maintained a mail cover on
the SWP national ofﬁce and “may
have induced members of the SWP
to inform the Government of SWP
activities.’ ’

The admissions, although aston-
ishing, are far from complete.
Perhaps even more astounding is
the government’s argument that
the defendants were “within the
scope of their authority and were
not operating in excess of their
statutory authority.”

The government's reply poses
these issues: Does the government
have the right to classify as
“subversive” any group and
individuals who oppose official
policy with or without an “Attorney
General’s List”? Further, does it
have the right to curtail the
constitutional rights of these
groups and individuals? ‘

Illegal government harassment‘
not only impairs a ,group’s
constitutionally guaranteedright to

_ participate inelections, but also

(‘SWP .
Disruption Program” from_l961 to .

deprives the American people of 

their right to consider all contend-
ing views.

When the suit was announced,
Boudin told reporters it could be “a
major step in reversing the erosion
of political and civil liberties.”

The suit speciﬁes an arson attack
by Cuban exiles with admitted CIA
connections, incidents of mail-
tampering, burglary, wiretapping
and FBI interrogation in 40 cities.

The plaintiffs have discovered
much and expect to discover more
evidenceof government illegality
as the litigation proceeds and the
trial begins.
already uncovered
following facts:

--During the contempt trial of the
Chicago_Seven, former government

includes the

i ll

agent John O’Brien admitted
federal government complicity with
a right-wing terror group and local
police in burglarizing SWP ofﬁces.

--In December, 1973, a govern-
ment spy was discovered inside the
San Diego .SWP during the
frame-up perjury trial of Salm
Kolis, then SWP candidate for San
Diego City Council.

--Documents released in Feb-
ruary, 1975, revealed an FBI
campaign to have ﬁred socialist
professor Morris Starsky from his
post at Arizona State University.

--Most recent revelations show
government agencies have contin-
ued to spy on the SWP and YSA
after April, 1971, when the spy
activities were to have ended. ‘

This latter fact prompted an
editorial in the October 10 New
York Times that stated in part:
“The Socialist ‘Workers Party is a

legal American political organiza-  -

tion. Although it has been the
subject of wiretap surveillance for
30 years, no indictments and no
convictions have been obtained by
the government. The only
conceivable purpose of the contin-
uation of the COINTELPRO techni-
ques is harassment and disruption
of legitimate political activity.”

It is clear that the PRDF-spon-
sored suit has accelerated the
process of forcing full release of the
facts about COINTELPRO and the
“SWP Disruption Program.’ ’
Boudin said: “This office never
takes cases of this kind unless we
believewe can win. And our record
will show that we rarely lose. This
case is winnable.” 7

Broad public support for the suit
is essential to demonstrate the
opposition by many to the erosion
of political and civil liberties and
to‘ prevent future government
harassment of dissidents.

The nationwide PRDF campaign
has drawn more than 1,500 civil
libertarian sponsors. Support has
come from Daniel Ellsberg, the
Berrigan brothers and Gilbert
Padilla, UFW secretary-treasurer.
Other endorsers include: former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
Eugene .McCarthy, Julian Bond,
Jules Feiffer, Huey P. Newton,
Erich Fromm and authors Joseph
Heller and Jessica Mitford.

Letters to the Editor  

We, the members of the
Interfraternity Council, are writing
this letter in regard to your issue of
October 27, 1975. We are very
upset to see that the Pitt News feels
that the importance of Homecom-
ing only deserves three-fourthsof a '
page in coverage. Homecoming is
one of the major events on our
campus, as on any campus, and
any stranger reading that issue
would not have realized that.‘ More
space was given to an article about
the ballet than to Homecoming. ‘

‘of the first-place banner, built by Pi

was as much a part of the parade as
any. While on the issue of the

The reference made under the

is “drunken fraternity men.” This
overused generalization is not true,
and we are shocked and offended
by the Pitt News’ unjournalistic use
of this nonfactual quotation.

We sincerely hope that the staff
of the Pitt News will look again "at
the priorities of their fellow
students. Furthermore, we hope
the proper coverage is given to
events that the majority of the
students are interested.

The article “Cho1'tﬁE_;,ief_s’ Early
Sonnets" by Pamela Eusi demands
a reply. Being a member of the
Heinz Chapel C_hoir, 1- realize that
charges of partisanism can be
levied against me, but feel that
these views should be aired. In
theory, I do not object to Eusi’s
personal views on the sound,
quality and technical difficulties
she felt the choir suffered during
its performance in Heinz Chapel on
November 2. I do, however object
to her‘ writing on the subject of

‘Renaissance music and its perfor-
mance practices when she appears
to have
knowledge of the subject.

From the opening paragraphs
and her discussion of Petrarch and
his works, she shows a complete
lack of awareness of the importance
and influence of his verses‘ upon
Renaissance musical thought and

absolutelif-_ no working

composition. Petrarch's sonnets
were the epitomy-j oftllé form and
played a direct role in the formation
of Renaissance thought, _and in no
way can be described as “yester-

was one of the reasons for the
upsurgence of._ liteiﬁagy -activity
during the late Middle Ages,‘ and in
fact was exactly as she lightly
dismissed it as being. The
medieval man did not think of a
woman as being someone to whom
he proved his personal worthiness,
but rather as a piece of chattel upon
which he placed slightly. higher
value than his livestock, due to her
importance in the breeding pro-
cess. »

“As a whole, the Rennaisance
sonnets were fairly interesting as
medeival tones and choral frills
prevailed.” This statement of
Eusi's leaves me at a complete loss
as to what she means. By the late
sixteenth century, the common use
of thirds, sixths and other
inconsonant intervals had almost
entirely replaced the exclusive use
of the perfect intervals and their
unique tonality; AS for “Choral

 w;a..sa.y,ln¢.;mb.; ,1 2,. i19"7s;rHE;   05%  ’ 

frills" there very simply are none.
Luca Marenzio (1553-1599), of
whom the choir performed two
works, was a composer of the late
Renaissance who was considered

and in no means someone‘s theory
of “choral frills." — ’

l feel that there is no excuse for
this quality of journalism in the Pitt

News and that a change should"

be made in the present situation. A

proposal I would like to submitiis’

the practice of giving space to the

upcoming programs of the Heinz_

Chapel Choir, Men's Glee Club,
Women's Chorale or ‘any other
University performing group be-
fore‘ the date of the event. By this

means more people would be\

informed and perhaps able to
attend these events and judge the
standards of performance for
themselves. ‘

 KBBPS On Struggling     Hunt  
  n For Jobs Overseas

BY KATHRYN KIMBALL

“Boycott grapes, head lettuce
and Gallo wine!”

Signs, stickers and leaﬂets with
that message are seen everywhere,
but _the reasoning behind the
United Farm Workers’ (UFW) plea
is not as well known. V

“The purpose of the United
Farm Workers is to bring justice
and dignity to farm workers,” said
Sue Ardisson, one of five perma-
nent staff members of Pittsburgh’s
UFW organization.

“The basic things we're strug-
gling for are the same things other
workers in the ’30s and '40s were
struggling for when they started to

- unionize. We want higher wages,

but it’s much, much more,” she
said.

Many farm workers “have

C I substandard housing, no medical

insurance, no bathroom facilities.

. Their children have to work so that

the family can eat, and many of
them suffer from malnutrition,”
said Ardisson, who became active
in the UFW while attending college
in West Virginia.

In 1962, Cesar Chavez organized
the farm workers, who participated
in their ﬁrst grape ﬁeld strike in
1965. Five hundred farm workers
travelled across the country in 1968
asking people to support their
cause by refusing to buy grapes.

ﬂ»

United Farm Workers staff mem-
ber Sue Ardisson.

As a result of the boycott,
contracts were signed between the
workers and 200 grape growers in
1970—the ﬁrst contracts of their
kind in the United States.

Under the contract, workers’
exposure to dangerous pesticides
was limited and clinics and service
centers were established.

“But most of all,” Ardisson said,
“they had a tremendous amount of
hope that their children wouldn't
have to go through the same hellish
thing they’d gone through.”

But when the contracts came up
for renewal in 1973, the corporate
growers refused to recognized the
Chavez union. Instead, they
brought in the Teamsters’ Union,
which signed contracts that Ardis-
son claims do not beneﬁt the
workers.

So in 1973, the grape strike
resumed, this time violently.

“The Western Conference of
Teamsters were paid $67.50 per
day to harass and beat up people on
the picket lines,” Ardisson said.
“The UFW is a nonviolent union
and wouldn't retaliate. There was
an injunction against the farm
workers and the police were called
1n.”
After two workers were killed,
the UFW members returned to
work. “The only thing that affects
the corporate growers is the
economic pressure of a boycott,”
Ardisson said.

In August 1973, the UFW
renewed efforts to sustain a boycott
against Gallo wine and non-UFW
grapes and lettuce. UFW
organizations were established
throughout the country and now

funds,” said Committee President
Allan Greenwald, a third-year
medical student. ,

The Committee maintains a ﬁle
of program information in the
Center for International Studies
(CIS) ofﬁce on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the
Lothrop Street Residence.

“The Center has been very
helpful in ﬁnancing students,”

Greenwald said. “There are many

ways to get fundsthat students
don’t kno_w gbout.”

Many foundations offer service
programs lasting between one term
and one year. Operation “Cross-
roads-Africa” sends volunteers to
underdeveloped areas for clinical
work. “Brother’s Brother,” a
Pittsburgh-based organization,
sponsors medical and dental
students for work in the Caribbean."
There are also many church-afﬁlia-
ted organizations that provide
opportunities in health care in
underdeveloped countries, accord-
ing to Greenwald.

Students usually become invol- 

ved in service programs, rather
than in classroom study when they
go abroad, Greenwald said.

“Here in the United States,
we’ve wiped out a number of
diseases, but we face a narrow
spectrum of problems compared to
the whole world,” he added. “A
student interested in tropical
medicine, for instance, would ﬁnd
nothing close to his interests.

“There is starvation here, but
not on the same scale as in other
countries. Studying abroad pres-
ents an opportunity to learn about a
broader range of medicine, dentis-
try or other health-related prob-

lems.” _

This term, several Pitt students

In addition, the Pittsburgh

-’At Kodak, we started close tohome. In

Why? Helping to combat water pollution not
only benefits society butus as well as we need
clean water to make film. Our combustible waste
disposal facility not only reduces air pollution
but also helps pay for itself in heat andsteam

 

production and silver recovery. Theblack enter-
prise program not only helps people who aren't a
well off but also helps stabilize communities in
which Kodak can work and grow.

' BY M.C. PILECKI _

Don't laugh too hard:. there’s

. a couple of new comedies in town.

One is aptly named Shhh. If you

it. Shhh is ’ basically ‘ a

good idea that didn’t quite work.
Director Bob Price compared the

obviously dated (1965) look at_

‘Crunch Crunch,” the only ani-,
mated entry, delivers a simple‘
moral lesson without providing
humor or any other motive for
watching the screen.

“Blaze Glory” is an outrageous I

cartoon that succeeds - by the

“Canoe Trip,” made especially for

Atco Records, SD-36-117

This is an album of moods. Each

‘cut is an instrumental, save one,

which, by the way, stinks. So how
else can you review it, but to try to
capture the mood? ~

If you remember three years ago,
you’ll recall it was Focus that

sized Belgian yodel to the world,
Now, with a little bearing on who
we're listening to, discard all the
past "yodi-odi-odi-o-po-pollll" and

“Mother Fo'cus,”'the title cut, is
a good rocker. It’s largely acoustic
guitar and rollicking piano with
some chanted la-da-das in the
background just for effect. Track
this to some moving pictures of
horseback riding and you’ve got
yourself a ﬁlm.

“Bennie He1der’,’ is smoother,
more synthetic. _Wet and airy, it

BY DOUG GEBHARD

“When the Spirit moves you" is an expression I grew used .t_o_during
my upbringing. It_may seem a bit strange, but I feel the Spirit more
now than I did during those years in the pew. I especially feel the force
today. It was rekindled by Dick Gregory and_a little taste of Adam
Smith's (ask Jerry Goodman) latest book, Powers of Mind. Gregory s
exhilirating energy and good feelings have stayed for two years since I
last saw him at Pitt. Smith's wit and verisimilitude has touched me in a
peculiar way. The same way, strangely enough, that the ECMrecords

have.

Contemplative vibrations is what I call it.

This style of music

pioneered by Coltrane and Miles has transformed itself into a much
more thought-provoking, image-making genre of jazz. ECM/Polydor
,Records is the American-distributed, German-made ECM Records.

 is known by followers of the group,

For one thing,
they don't press as many records
with the same master, and so get a
much cleaner sound. And the
recording techniques, along with
the production of these records, are
an addition to the quality of the
music. .

Gary Burton, Keith Jaret, Chick
Corea, Eberhard Weber and Ralph
Towner are some of the noted
performers recording on ECM.
Many of these releases are duets,
teaming incredible technicians to
produce masterpieces. A

Of the 20-odd discs on ECM,
are few that. fit my
contemplative vibrations category:

“Matchbook,” by Weber. The
kinetic forces surrounding the
sound on these albums are not
totally unlike those of the Spirit
about which we have been taught.

I speak of the life force or “it” (from Smith) that is, in effect, aloose
term for the soul. If you believe we have it, then you canbelieve we
don't “have it” but that ‘»‘it is.” The soul of music can be the same
soul of humans. The energy that Gregory says is being murdered with
premeditation by certain leaders is the very same energy we expend on
wanton food waste, especially in ourmeat-oriented society.

Rather than destroying, these artists are building. They are building
up resources of energy with their playing. If not in just the very essence
of acoustic music, we have a harmony withour souls (rhythm and
clarity via acoustic sounds). The nature of this jazz is inward.

I stress‘ this form of jazz over any others because of its seemingly
simplistic style and because it reflects the art of the older masters.
There is a new vogue trend, called “jazz” by many, but I think that
upon investigation one might reconsider its roots and_technique——
mainly because it has neither. This chic music is danced to, drunk by,
gotten high on and Lord knows what else. It is ‘by no stretch of the
imagination “jazz” as Ralph J. Gleason saw it and heard it.

Artist Sh ipman Loses

BY MREA CSORBA

Except for glorious scenes of
sexual union, males and females
seldom meet on painters’ canvases.
One sex or the other is chosen to
develop the theme, then the two
are framed into segregated still-
lifes. « .
But life is a constant and

. complex interaction of the sexes.

Painter Helen Shipman recog-
nizes this and depicts the tension

work contains action—the main
ingredient in real-life relationships
—with ﬂuxes and subtle undercur-
rents. She strips her ﬁgures nude
and, with keen insight, probes the
manipulation, alienation and power
struggles between the sexes.

The ideas raised are dynamic,
but Shipman weakens them in her
conveyance. Large canvases
alternate with smaller prints—the
latter carrying 'more weight.
Shipman seems to have trouble
ﬁllingthe available space of the
larger works without diluting their
statement. »

"The paintings are straightfor-
ward almost to a fault.‘ Shipman
lays out the theme so that little
headwork or imagination is re-
quired from the viewer.

Despite its explicitness, “Death
of a Marriage” is intriguing. A
couple is locked into respective
destructive love patterns. She, on

dialogue, no love interest, no real
personalities involved, except the
abstract struggle between man and
what nature has put in his way.
That’s what you'd expect a good
short to be about.
Another addition to the local
silver screen is Hearts of the
West, a good-natured look at
Hollywood in the ’30s. It’s not
really a comedy, mind you,
although it's not without its laughs.
It’s just a simple story of the Iowa
rube who goes West to become a
writer of pulp western fiction, and

. instead runs into a B Hollywood

production company.

The hero, played amiably by Jeff
Bridges, talks in the same sort of
stilted dialogue he gives to his
fictional characters, and manages
to survive . even through his
naivete.

Hearts is relatively simple fare.
Nothing deep, nothing to fathom.
There are no side-splitting scenes.

It’s just basically a pleasant little '

movie that is satisfying enough.

|sMaj'ors Playing Too Conservatively?

any quarterback doesn't make a _»

~ Tony Dorsett could not be faulted for his performance last Saturday

 

BY JIM SPANOS

Against weak opponents the
caliber of a William and Mary or
Army football team, the Pitt
offense works like the engine of a
ﬁnely tuned automobile. Against
stronger teams,‘ it ‘runs like -a
burnt-out ’57 Chevy.

.The game Pitt played against

West Virginia on Saturday, is‘

reminiscent of the game at Pitt this
season that -Navy won, 17-0. In
many respects, the 17-14 West
Virginia ﬁasco was a carbon copy of
the game played two weeks earlier.

In both games, Pitt failed to
score in the ﬁrst three quarters.
Unable to sustain any sort of
offensive thrust, Head Coach

In both games, Pitt played its
best in the fourth quarter, when
forced to abandon its conservative
game plan and mix in an occasional
pass with the run. In neither of the
tussles
members give up hope until the
gun had sounded.

‘ But a game is won or lost not just'

in the final minutes or seconds. If
you avoid getting yourself in the
predicament of being behind 14-0
or in a 14-14 dogﬁght late in the
fourth quarter, you don't need to
panic in those final minutes. The
West Virginia game was lost,_ not in
the last minute. of the game, but
during the 59 minutes preceeding

« it. The same thing can be said for

the Navy game.

Against Navy and WVU, the
defense did its job, holding the
opponents’ offenses at bay. Seven-
teen points aren't many to give up
in a football game. Thus the blame
cannot be placed on lackadaisical
defensive play.

In both games, Tony Dorsett and
Elliott Walker ran with determina-
tion as expected. Roberjt Haygood

The most salient characteristic of

attack was needlessly ignored.

You, of course, remember the
forward pass. Well, for some
reason the coaching staff at Pitt has
little conﬁdence in the passing
game. The Panther game plan
consists of the most basic,
conservative repertoire of plays
imaginable. A handoff to Dorsett
up in the middle here, a handoff to
Walker there.

They used to call it three yards
and a cloud of dust.

That Dorsett and Walker are
exceptional runners was proven
long ago; this is_not in question.
What is questionable, however, is
how the coaching staff can justify
not allowing the ball to be passed at
all in the first quarter against West
Virginia. And in the first 29
minutes of the game, only three
passes were tried.

Ohio ' State, notorious for its
reluctance to put the ball in the air,
can do without the pass because its
offensive lines can «provide Archie
Griffin and Pete Johnson with

' A team like Pitt, still in the

going to win few games against an
aggressive defense by running up
the middle or around the end on
three successive downs. This
should have been made clear after

What is most disturbing about
the two losses is that, man for man,
