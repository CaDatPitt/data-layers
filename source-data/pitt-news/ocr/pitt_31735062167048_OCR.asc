UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Time Weighs H€aVY Grossi New AWS President,

A5 New Senate Lam Pools Attract 6% of Women
,. By Committee Reports

by DAN BOOKER
There have been long Stu-
dent Government (SG) meet-
ings. Three and four hour meet-
ings have been fairly common

in the last three years. There
have also been SG meetings that
only seemed lo-ng. The ﬁrst busi-
ness meeting of the new Sen-
ate Wednesd-ay night was one
of these.

With major committee ap-
po.intments (most notably to the
Allocations Committee) post-
poned until the Feb. 29 meeting,
the new senators settled down
for an hour and a half to listen
to a few long» committee reports
and take action on two cabinet
appointments by President Ken
Schueler.

Mvarc Speigel, chairman of the
Liberal Arts Cabinet, reported
that a new course evaluation,
covering 77 distribution of
studies courses, is being publish-
ed. The 400-page book will be
available in limited copies in the
library.

He explained that the evalua-
tion will be “radically different”
from that printed la.st term. It
will include not only a listing
of questions and the number of
responses to each, but also an
analysis of the answers in
terms of a students class, QPA,
and expected grade in the course.
Speigel could not say for sure
when the evaluation would be
ﬁnished.

Speigel’s 40 minute report also
«included plans to develop an in-
terdep-artmental program. Un-
der this structure, students in
their sophomore year would be
able to plot a special program

not necessarily including a ma-
jor in a usual undergraduate
department. Programs might be
developed in such areas as re-
ligion, urban studies, or Ameri-
can studies. “The key thing
here is to provide a ﬂexibility
in program,” emphasized Speig-
el.

Paul Stoller, chairman of Tap
Day, got an argument from the
Senate concerning the selection
of a keynote speaker for the
tapping ceremonies. Linda Gold-
stein, editor of the Pitt News,
had been chosen keynote speak-
er.

Senator Jack La Pietra won-
dered “whether it would be feas-
ible to have two speakers at the
ceremony, considering there are
two seniors who by virtue of
their positions are able to rep-
resent student interests—the
editor of the Pitt News and the
president of Student Govern-
men ."

Stoller answered that he did
not think that it would be feasi-
ble due to the length of the
program and the traditional role
of the Tap Day speaker as set-
ting a keynote.

In other action, the Senate
approved the appointment of
George Hopson, LA sophomore,
to the cabinet position of direc-
tor of public relations. Hopson
has been a member of Men’s
Dorm Council, the William Pitt
Debate Union, the Secondary
Schools Committee and the SG
Publicity Committee.

Action on the appointment of
Stuart Lowenthal, LA junior, to
the post of director of ﬁnance
was postponed un-til the next
meeting.

Summer Billing Plans

Students attending classes during the Spring will be
billed under a new and more convenient system. '

Last spring, students who took nine credits in both the
Spring and Summer sessions were billed per credit, and
were therefore overcharged. Instead of being billed $700,
they were charged $846. They then had to take their in-
voices back to student accounts to be adjusted.

To avoid this confusion, Assistant Chancellor of Fi-
nance David Smith has announced a plan which “puts a
price tag on the number of credits the student is taking.”

If the student is taking one to
five credits, he is charged on a
per credit basis of $47 (or $14
for in-state students) per credit.
If he signs up for six to 11 cred-
its, his invoice reads for one half

Possible $100 Tuition Increase
Provokes Various Commentary

The threatened $100 tuition
hike has ellicted various com-
ments from legislators and Uni-
versity administration.

State Senator Robert Fleming
(Rep., president pro-tem from
Aspinwal) hopes that it is not
necessary to raise the tuition,
but is not certain “whether we
can ﬁnd enough money in the
funds we have now” to counter-
act the threat.

Fleming believes that Penn-
sylvania state government has
an “over-commitment” in all
institutions, not only education-
al institutions. “People are de-
manding services with no
thought as to the source of the
money to su.p-port these serv-
ices.”

State Senator Ernest P. Kline
(Dem., Beaver) believed, how-
ever, that there is “no reason
to suggest a tuition increase un-
til some analysis of the Univer-
sity’s ﬁnancial position is made.
The University and the other
state-related schools are receiv-
ing money, although it is less
than requested.”

He emphasizes that there may
not be a need for -a tuition hike.
and that the presentation of the

allocations by the Governor was
unnecessary at this time.

On the University administra-
tion’s side of the issue, Chancel-

lor Wesley W. Posvlar stated

that the Governor's budget is so

short of revenues that if some-

full time, or $350 ($12.50 for in-
state students). If taking 12 cred-
its or over, the student is charged
the full time rate of $700 ($225
for in-state students.)

The system uses two invoices:
one for the spring term and
Spring session and/or Summer
session courses. Anyone going
both sessions receives one in-
voice.

Graduate and professional
school students will be charged at
appropriate rates.

Toni Gross-i, Devra Kimlbuall,

respective organizations in the
combined woman's elections

Green Calls For International Council on War

FELIX GREENE
_ On Vietnam and China _

by PAUL STOLLER

The Vietnamese War
irags on day after day.
Each week the American
oublic is informed of the
mounting casualties and the
deaths of U.S. soldiers. With
the situation as bleak as it is, is
there any hope for an honor-

able solution to the war? Felix
Greene believes there is.

Green, a noted journalist, au-
thor, and expert on Southeast
Asian and Chinese affairs stat-
ed that “a possible solution to
the war would lie in the forma-
tion of an International Confer-
ence that would act as an arbi-
tration body. This means that
the decision of the conference
would be binding on all the gov-

. ernments, p_art:lcipa.ting.'f_ D 

 

 

He postulated that the con-
ference would have to take three
initial steps to end the conﬂict.
“The conference must suggest
the phase out of American
troops, the formation of an in-
ternation controlling body to
stabilize the situation, and the
holding of a national Vietna-
mese election."

Harrison Salisbury and other
Journalists who have traveled
extensively in Southeast Asia
stress pressing need of negotia-
tions in the Vietnamese conﬂict.
They, in short, fear Chinese in-
tervention. Greene agrees with
this sentiment.

“The US," says Greene, “is
heading for a pro-1-onged War
with China. The Chinese will
intervene in the war, I think,

, )iVt...t_here is an invasion of Ch1- A V

na. Likewise, a large scale US

invasion of North Vietnam.

would most likely provoke Chi-
nese intervention. I also fear

. that if this war is pursued much

longer, the North Vietnamese
will eventually ask the Chinese
for help. And I think the Chi-
nese would respond instantly."
But why would the Chinese
respond so quickly? Greene "an-
swers this question by review-
ing the Chinese perception of
the Vietnamese conrﬂa-geraltion.

“The Chinese believe that the
Vietnamese War is historic. It
involves more than just the fu-
ture or Vietnam. It involves the
future of worldwide American
military--commerlcal strength,”
according to Greene.

 Bond Quotes Gregory . A?
In Campaign Speech Dream Study Yields Rewards  

by DON MARBURY

“Peace and freedom are the two ideals most cherished
by man. To work towards their becoming a reality IS an
almost holy task. I am honored to _]Oln with YOU 111 V0111‘
efforts to salvage the Democratic process from the decep-
tion and corruption of politics, and pledge my continued

. . . - - - yr
service to the spirit of human rights and Justice.

After "reading this telegram from presidential hopeful Dick
Gregory, Julian Bond the state legislator from Atlanta. Ga-. began
his speech -last Tuesday evening. The young Democrat, who only

7 a year ago was refused his seat in the state legislature because
of his outspoken views against the war in Vietnam, was her-e yes-

terday campaigning for Gore-gory.

Bond was asked if he really thought that Gregory W818 actually
qualiﬁed to run for the presidency. “I can’t see Why not. We have
a second rate actor for the governor of California. Yes, he’s just
as qualiﬁed as any other person.” Bond also gave. the examples
of Harry Truman who was a haberdasher before becoming Pres-
ident, and Lester Maddox who only comrpleted six years of school

and became governor of Georgia.

Bond feels tliat Gregory has a very good chance to win the
election. “Votens faced with the candidates Johnson, Nixon, and
Wallace would probably because of no one better, vote for John-
son, but with Gregory thrown in they then would have an alterna-

tive.

Although Bond said that he
w-asn’t a spokesman for Greg-
-ory, he stated that if Gregory
were elected, his ﬁrst act would
sprobably be total de-escalation
from Vietnam.

Bond felt that President John-
s-on’—s difficulties stemmed from
Kennedy’-s adminisutration.

In outlining some of the be-
1-iefs of the Negro politicians,
Bond made the statement “Peace
cannot exist unless all men en-
joy their rights, and no man
can enjoy his rights until this
battle is won.”

Bo-nd ended his speech for
Gregory by relating this story:
a small, southern Negro boy
had been chosen by his teacher
to take a plane ride to New
York. Since he was from an un-
derprivileged ne.ighborhood, he
was naturally overwhelmed by
tliﬁ ‘sight of such a grand city-.
But as the plane was landing
he happened to catch sight of
the inscription «at the base of
the Statue of Liberty which
read: “Give me your tired, your
poor, your huddled masses
yearning to be free.” The little
boy looked up at the statue and
said, “Baby, here we are.”

Dr. Miller Concludes Series

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

Dreams are necessary for
normal personality func-
tioning, according to Glenn
Miller, professor of clinical
psychology at the Univers-
ity. Miller also pointed out
that dream study possesses great
potential in the ﬁeld of psycho-
therapy.

His lecture Tuesday night at
the YM and WHA was the last
of a series which stressed the
promises and rewards of dream
research.

“There is a complicated inter-
action between the psychologic-
al and physiological functions
of dreams,” stated Miller. He
said that, according to Freud,
the physiological function of
the "dream state“ is personal-
ity inwtegratiorn and emotional
maturation. H-e also stated that

Bucknell Rule Permits
Drinking inDormitories

(ACP)-—The Board of Trus-
tees, Bucknell University, Lew-
isburg, Pa., has -approved a
change_ in regulations which
would, in effect, permit students
to drink in their dormitory
rooms. The rule will go into ef-
fect when procedures for im-
plementation and enforcement
are worked out.

The Bucknellian commented
the Trustees for their action:

First, we congra-tul-ate -the
Trustees on this sign of their
faith in our common sense and
maturity. We have urged this
step for some time, in keeping
with other evidences of a more
liberal attitude toward students.

Second, we urge students to
prove the Board’s action was

clearly intended to expand the
appropriate. The change was
realm in which students might
make private decisions regard-
ing their private lives. It is an
abandonment in part, of the “in
loco parentis” doctrine of die-
tating to us how we should con-
duct our private affairs.

Regardless of what proce-
dures are set up to enforce the
rule, each student must remem-
ber he is still a member of a
community, keeping in mind
that even private actions could
—in a 'dormitory——prove disturb-
ing to others. We believe that
when the new rule goes into ef-
fect, it will be selfenforcing.

“dreaming is part of a basic

biological cycle built into men
and animals.”

The meaning imputed on a
dream is a function of the per-
sonality, according to Miller. He
compared the need to dream to
the need to eat, saying that each
is both socially and psychologic-
ally determined.

Miller said that increased dream
time increases the potential of
the individual. He sttressed that
“we will never ﬁnd the true
meaning of dreams until we can
separate the biological and phy-
siological correlates of dream-
ing.” _

When a person dreams he re-
leases hostilities and inhibitions,
Miller pointed out. He theor-
ized that if dream time can be
increased, an individual will
have greater control over his
relation to his environment.

Dream time ca-n be condition-
ed, according to Miller, to facili-
tate studying of dreams. He

’ said that methods are needed to

induce dreaming without using
drugs which may produce harm-
ful «side effects.

“Ideally, we will be able to
use dream conditioning in our
daily lives to rel-ease tension,”
he said. If dreams canbe util-
ized in this m-ann-er, he feels
that f'rustra.tions can be great-
ly alleviated.

Miller also showed that dream-
ing can be us-ed to cure insom-
nia. He said that there are two
types of insomnia, each accom-
panied by its own brain wave
pattern. Although both types
are treated by the same type of

medication, he feels that they
should be treated as separate
problems.

Dreaming has imD01‘t5ml3 im'
plications in hospitals, Miller
pointed o11t. He said that most
heart attacks occur while dream-
ing, since the body undergoes
tremendous blood Dre-Slsllre,
pulse, and chemical variations.
“The dream,” he explained,‘
“puts such a strain on the phy-
siological state that the weak
heart ca.n’t withstand it.”

This implies, accordinwg to Mil-
ler, is that something is needed
to express long dream periods
of individuals with weak hearts,
in the form of either condition-
ing of ‘drugs. The technique
would also have to enable the
patient to experience the equiva-
lent of dream time while his
body is functioning normally,
perhaps during the aft-ern-oon.

Rsychopuaiths, Miller pointed
out, don’t receive enough stim-
ulation from their environment,
and therefore have no idea of
right or wrong. He said that
“a minimal amount of stimula-
tion is necessary for personalaizty
integration.” He theorized that
perhaps dreaming fulﬁlls some
sort of internal stimulation lack-
ing in the envlironmenit, and sug-
gested that this idea could be
utilized in tire-atring psychopaths.

Miller said that dream re-
search is very helpful in en-
abling the individual to realize
and accept his «impulses. He
stated that keeping a dream log
would enable the individual to
develop a greater awareness of
his self.

Parks Discards Rules
In Favor of Anarchy  

by JOE ANDERSON

Van Dyke Parks’ Song Cycle is more than just a fascinating cha-
otic compendium of an artist’s autobiography. It is a milestone in con-
temporary rock music. Song Cycle is a progeny of the recording stu-
dio and the electric orchestra—the workshop and tools of today’s com-
posers. But the environment out of which the album sprung is not
as" important as the genius of its young creator, Van Dyke Parks.

Parks has discarded the restrictions of the past (unity of time,
simplicity of structure, and repetition of theme) in favor of complete
artistic anarchy.

His music, for want of a better word, could be called “serious.”
His arrangements are complex, and have the sophistication and ma-
turity of style that one of ten associates with avant-garde jazz. Studio
effects abound also, from bombs

the population of the Us (six
Der cent of the worlds popula.
tion) control-s 60 per cent of the
world's wealth.

Greene says that the US jus-
tifies its economic control by
espousing the d efense of
the free world. “I challenge the

use of these words for the
wrong purposes. How can US
officials claim that they are de-
fending the free world when
they support the Ky’s, the Sig-
mund Ree’-s, and all the dicta-
tors of Latin America? When
the US supports these men, it is
n-ot supporting freedom-—it is
mainltaining its own interests.”

In this light, the US is vul-
nerable. according to Greene,
“Because it is identiﬁed with
colonial interests. And every-
body knows that the (people in
the underdeveloped areas rise
up against their dictators. They

reject any power -that is identi-

Greene contests that this war
will mark a turning point in
world history. “If the US wins

back the rev-olurtionlary move-
ment. However, the Chinese are
conﬁdent that the US Will suc-

Greene, “that the US is a paper

Combined with this flare for
musical theatrics are Parks’
story-time lyrics which are both
auto—biographical and cryptic.
The obscurity is due to Parks’
obsession with wordplay, espe-
cially puns. The fact that the
vocal is often overshadowed by
the orchestration does not help
interpretation either. At times the
members of the orchestra seem to
view with each other as to whose
instrument should be the most
dominant.

“Palm Desert” is Parks’ narra-
tive of his first encounter with
Hollywood, the “never never

“By The People” his “Cauca-

struggle of the Negro to that of
the early Russian people. Each
group was told by its oppressor
that they would have to be grad-
ual in their demands for reform,
but neither group found this step
by step plan satisfactory. Parks
was his “S0118 of the forgotten
South” with a plea for the Ne-
gro, “just don’t hang us up here.”

The importance of this album
lies in the fact that it establishes
a new stylistic structure that is
extremely flexible when in the
hands of an artist such as Van
Dyke Parks. Song Cycle has open-
ed up a new field of expression
for the more serious rock com-
poser. The experimental form has
been proved a success. There re-

AWS: A Need for Direction

Associated Women Students (AWS) elected officers Wednesday,
along with the other women’s organizations. AWS had the largest
turnout of any of the groups electing officers—approximately six per
cent of those women eligible to vote. The poor turnout is significant,
for it indicates a real lack of interest in the University’s women’s ac-
tivities. However, we wonder if the lack of response is but a reflection
of a more basic weakness of AWS.

‘ ° Perhaps the crux of the problem is the failure of AWS in the past
to communicate its actvities to the student body. When one thinks of
AWS, activities such as Lantern Night, Freshman Council, and Housing
Board are the only ones that come to mind. Yet Housing Board has its
own head and representatives and is virtually separated from AWS in
terms of‘ its functions. Lantern Night is but one night of the year. And
Freshman Council is basically run by the freshman girls elected to
serve, rather than the AWS board, although an AWS representative

chairs the Council.

We are not saying that AWS has not done an effective job; what
we are saying is that if AWS has accomplished a good deal, it has been
a well-kept secret. If AWS did not falter in its duties, it did fail to
make students aware of its programs. ' An organization such as Hous-
'ing Board has no need to define its role; it is obviously self-explanatory.

But AWS has ignored the vital need to communicate its efforts to our
student body, as illustrated by the response of the women students in
Wednesday’s elections. 0

AWS’s course poses a real challenge to the newly-elected president,
Toni Grossi. It will be her responsibility to either alter the direction
AWS has taken in the past, in an attempt to improve the status quo, or
remain silent and trod that all too familiar path to anonymity. Judging
by her past achievements, we are confident she will choose the former
alternative. Her remarks reinforce this judgment: “AWS has been
limiting itself in some of its activities. A lot of things are too inbred.
It should not just be narrow in what it does; it should be an all-round
organization.”

The task before Miss Grossi is a formidable one; she must set the
precedent in giving AWS the direction it needs to deserve its status as
a major organization. She must recognize that AWS cannot remain
isolated; it should also concern itself with University-wide issues, rather
than only women’s activities.

Perhaps AWS is taking a new turn, however. By electing Miss
Grossi at the helm, it has already taken a vital step toward improving
itself. For, if one’s past record is any guide, Toni Grossi will give AWS
new direction; she will attain what has heretofore been regrettably

unattainable.

 

 

What Is Wrong — H

Decry Complacency

PRINCE'l‘0N’s AND PENN ’s annual spring riots
are wonderful things. Consider all the spirit and
good fellowship involved when thousands of Ivy
Leaguers get together to throw a few water bombs
and to lift a few Volkswagons. It's a pity that the
University does not foster the unity to partake in
equally constructive pastimes. A few wet police-
men would be worth it.

But in Oakland, the spectre of Apathy reigns
supreme. We can't even arouse more than 3000
people to decide on whether to abolish their own
student government or not. The situation here
does not need to be pointed out to anyone; but the
causes should be examined.

REASONS FOR APATIIY

Unlike 1963-64, we have no athletic teams to
rally behind. Not enough of us are interested in
the teams purely for love of sport, so we rarely
get together in any numbers to cheer on in unity.
The cheer leaders might as well perform in suits
of armor before a handful of deaf-mutes.

MANY COMPLAIN that Student Government
and other organizations with their related cormnit-
tees and cabinets limit their members to a continual

‘select few. Statistics will prove the complainers’

point, but too few of them try to do anything about
it.

, Many of them are commuters, and discussion

0 concerning the commuters always analogizes the
’ University to a glorified high school. It is true that

there seems to be very little to offer the commuter.
But did their own high schools have such mass
apathy?

Everyone here is labeled and has his own badge
of footwear pertaining to his classification: Greeks
with their Weejuns, Engineers with their white
socks, independents and commuters with their
oxfords and hippies with their boots. The classi-
fications are further divided and re-divided tino
segregated groups. This is not to say that we are
downright cligueish; it's just that in our littlé
groups it is easier to find that “identity” we're all

i supposed to be searching for.

THE WHOLE PROBLEM is that there is no
one, central entity with which we can all identify
and around which we can all rally. There is no
great issue, team, organization or tradition with
which we all can, or will be involved either posi-
tively or negatively.

THE R101‘
The one recent exception is last spring’s riot.

i , If just for the sake of making mass noise and pain

for the police, at least we were together and ac-
tive on something. And the administration be
damned—tlie riot can be considered a start in the
right direction. I am hardly advocating destructive
Peace-breakinﬁ S0. outside of a riot, where are

7 V we most cohesive and spirited?

ing ﬂoats? What single group makes the most noise
on this campus? The fraternities and sororities.
Collectively, the Greeks look out for their own
interests; individually, they instill a loyalty and
healthy rivalry that are to be found nowhere else
at the University.

BUT TOO MANY of the fraternities are in seri-
ous financial trouble, and the miserable alternative
of the dorm houses may not be the administration's
last attempt to de-emphasize the Greeks. Greek
membership has increased lately, but hardly in
proportion to the overall University enrollment
increase. Although the selectivity involved in rush-
ing and bidding cuts internal conﬂict and loss of
interest to a minimum, the fraternities have not
completely escaped the plague of apathy that has
stricken the rest of the campus.

Assuming the University can ever obtain funds,
the administration could make the Greek system
a vital force for good. Improved and cheaper hous-
ing, allocations and more University sponsored so-
cial events would create a vastly popular and
unifying activity. Natural rivalry would instill a
desire to excell among many more students. Uni-
versity aid would cut costs and make the fra-
ternities more attractive to all students, including
commuters.

BUT IF THE ADMINISTRATION does not pro-
duce the long-sought fraternity row or any other
encouragement. it may be slowly murdering what
other universities have found to be a strong, co.
hesive element. '

AN ALTERNATIVE

If the administration is determined to kill or
de-emphasize the Greek system, it could find an
alternative in the club system such as that found.
at Princeton and other Ivy League sohoo1s_

The clubs could be set up in the dorms and
compete for members just as the Greeks do. As
University sponsored, they would not be ethnically
labeled, and there is room for enough clubs so that
no student would have to be excluded. Their num-
bers and minimal cost would attract commuters.
The _clubs W°U1d Produce the productive rivalry
that IS now found only in the fraternity system.

The Princeton club system could be worked into
the University structure with some effort. The at-
kegcliptthwould be well worth any initial problems.

Negro Study

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing this in response
to Dan Booker’s article in the
Negro Supplement written by
the Pitt News in the Feb. 7 edi-
tion. Your article was the only
one -th-at -addressed itself to the
question of interracial dating on
this campus.

Unconﬁrmed reference was
made to action taken by the
Dean of Women's office over
this matter and was of great
concern to me. I attended un-
dergraduate school at a major
southern university where such
policy was rather standard for
a period of time, but to ﬁnd
such a thing at a major north-
ern urban university is quite
shocking . . . at least for me.

It seems to me that the staff
of the University newspaper
has the responsibility to inves-
tigate fully this matter for sev-

eral reasons. If this type of po-
licy does exist then it is a di-
rect infringement upon the
rights of University students,
both black -and white, and calls
into questions exactly what the
role of the Dean of Women's
office really plays in thelife of
women students on this campus.
I d-o not encourage the Pitt
News to sensationalize this mat-
ter in a series of revealing ar-
ticles because this could harm
individuals who are engaged in
interracial social relationships.
However, this area of race re-
lations and regulations is by
far the most emotional and too
often avoided or distorted.
Certainly the staff of the pa-
per should be concerned with
such policies and serve to 
tiate some type of constructive
inﬂuence for change if such
prejud-ice and traditionalism
does exist on the part of the
administrative staff of Pitt.

Probably the best way to stir
up some excitement at the Field
House during the remaining
two home basketball games
Monday and Wednesday would
be to turn Bagheera, or what-
ever the new Panther’-s name is,
loose into the crowd (Crowd?
You see a crowd?). Unfortun-
ately, for reasons that are ap-
parent-—to us, at least~—thiss is
not feasible.

Instead, we offer the cheer-
leaders several helpful hints:

‘> Reco-gnizing that spirit
tends to pick up when the band
plays (drum beat, etc.), try oo-
ord-inating cheers with the band.

> Try some boogalooin’ with

Lucy.

-> Shorten cheers to simpler-
type commands, like Go!
(Drum), Go! (Drum), Go!
(Drum).

>More stompin’ and clap-
ping; less organized cheers.

'> Bring a ﬁsh tank to help
out Home Czarnecki.

-> Have the bland play some-
thing like “Sweet Georgia
Brown” during the pre- game
warm-ups.

And our ﬁnal reminder to you,
cheerleaders, in hopes that you
won't be offended by our sug-
gestions; we realize, you may
be mediocre, but at least you're
sincere. "

Praises ‘News’

Editor, The Pitt News:

You are to be commended for
the pertinent and provacative
supplement, “‘The Negro on
Campus” (Wednesd-ay, Feb. 7).

Institutions of higher educa-
tion, particularly urban univer-
sities, are certainly in a posi-
tion to openly discuss and de-
bat-e the attitudes and behavior
of black and white students re-
garding race. More importantly.
universities such as Pitt can
provide a power catylst thru
which the exercise of such at-
titudes and behavior can be a
positive factor in creating new
dimen-sxions in "both urban high-
er education and in human and
social renewal in the city.

When camp-us channels of
communication and information
such as The Pitt News begin
to give attention and visibility
to urban racial matters, others
of us might not ﬁnd the issue
so easy to ignore.

For Recognition

Editor The Pitt News:

The Lamnbda Chapter of Del-
ta Sigma Pi, the professional
business fraternity, held a
smoker at the Hotel Webster
Hall last Friday, Feb. 2. The
guest speaker was Jack Free-
mlan, assistant chancellor at the
University. While outlining the
fu-ture plans of the University,
he pointed out all the facilities
available to the 13,000 full-time
day students, but there seem-
ed to be no immediate plans for
the 13000 part-time students in
the School of General Studies.

I would like to remind the ad-
ministration that the School of
General Studies d-oes still exist
and its students represent the
business community of Pitts-
burgh.

Soph Questions
Negro Attitude

Editor, The Pitt News:

I found your section to the
Negro at Pitt rather frustrat-
ing. Actually, I think the color
question is frustrating. It seems
to me that the Negro is rather
prone to criticize the white re-
gardless of his actions. If the
white pays no attention to him,
the Negro claims he has been
snubbed. If the white is friend-
ly, the Negro resents it as sim-
ply a gesture meaning, “Look,
I don’t discriminate.” So, the

white is in a helpless and em-
bara-ssing position.

Negro students complain that
no one approaches them in the
cafeteria or the football stadi-
um. True, because the white
senses that he is not wanted. If
a white did sit down at an all
Negro table, wouldn't they raise
the cry of tokenwism that they
raised throughout the section in
The Pitt News? I wish I could
believe that they wouldn't.

Carl Wooten says that the
Negro can't identify with a
homecoming that has the Yard-
Birds. The accusation is -a lit
tle unfair. As I recall, the
Temptations came last year; Di-
onne Warwick and Louis Arm-
s»t.rr:vng were scheduled this year;
and the Fantastic Johnny C.
came last week. The white stu-
dents didn’t seem to have prob-
lems identifying. The Negro stu-
dents seem to be reinforcing the
color line that they are accus-
ing others of reinforcing. A col
ored grad student at Southern
Illino-is University admitted this
to me: “I really d-ig Simon and
Garfunkel,” he said. “Then I

 

stop‘ and realize ‘Hey, I'm not
supposed to dig them!’”

I am not saying t-h-at the Ne-
gro is not discriminated. against.
I am saying that he accentuates
the situation by putting up ob-
stacles for any well-meaning
white friendship, especially by
his natural and lamentable ten-
dencv to label any attempt to
break the racial barrier as “tok-
enism.” Some of it is, yes, but
even this advances understand-
ing. I mention SIO again. I am
not an expert on this Universi-
ty, but I have been there. There
are “salt and pepper” parties
and other interracial efforts that
could be called tokeni.sm. How-
ever, there are much freer
white-black relati~o-nships. White

and bl-ack sit together in the

cafeteria and just talk. Inter-
racial dating is rather common.
Perhaps some people think this
lamentable (I disagree), but
there is much more understand-
ing at SIU than other campuses
I have seen. I felt mostly ac-
cepted by the black community
as a person and not as a med-
dling white. Of course, SIU does

not have perfect racial under-
standing, but it has a lot more
than Pitt. The reason is not
simply a difference in white at-
titude, but also in black attitude.
I felt it quite clearly.

I don't intend to cut up the
students quoted in The Pitt
News. Many of their accusa-
tions have justiﬂcation; we all
know it and it’s due time we
listened to them. It is also time
black students listened to white
students’ frustrations about the
racial situation. If some read-
ers asking why the heck I don’t
pack up and go to SIU, it may
interest them that I'm thinking
about it.

University Graduate Named
As Inspiration To Education

Mrs. Marion Barkley Step-
nick, a graduate of the Un:iver-
sity, has been named one of the
nation’s outstanding elementary
education teachers by the Grade
Teacher magazine, the profes-
sional magazine read by more
than two-thirds of the elemen-
tary school teachers in the Unit-
ed States.

Mrs. Stepnick, who is present-
ly teaching at the Lincoln School
in Pittsburgh, is one of the 180

women cited by Grade Teacher
as an inspiration to educators
at all grade levels.

Trendex, Inc., a national re
search orgvanization, contacted
school superintendents for preli-
minary recovmmendatnions which
were submitted to the magazine.
Final selections were made by
the editors after a detailed ana-
lysis of the nominees’ teaching
experience and techniques.

were ratiﬁed by the voters. Miss
Grossi, president-elect of the or-
ganization, commented optimis-
tically that this change in by-
laws will give AWS Council a
lot more free-way. The revised
by-laws set up a new position of
coordinating chairman who will
have the responsibility of coor-
dinating and organizing all com-
mittees of AWS. According to
the new president, the post is
designed to allow more com-
munication between chairmen.

Miss Grossi further stated
that “AWS has been limiting it-

Former US Military Men Oppose
‘ Government Policy in Vietnam War

 

 

CHICAGO (CPS)—A gro-wing phenomenon of the Vietnam war has been the oppo-
sition of former military men to US policy.

General David Shoup, former Marine Corps commandant, has called some argu-
ments in favor of the war “unadulterated poppycock.” General James Gaven has been
widely mentioned as a possible Presidential candidate because of his opposition to the
war. Brigadier General Samuel Griffith, J r., an authority on Communist China, has op-
posed the war, too, as have Admiral Arnold E. True, Generals Robert Hughes, William

Ford, and Hugh B. Hester.

But anti-war feeling among vet-
erans for Peace have been form-
ed in towns and cities from
Sloatsburg, N. Y. to Hacienda
Heights, Calif. These groups have

1. several thousand members.

They provide military speakers
against the war, participate in
rallies and demonstrations, and
often put anti-war advertisements
in local papers. A

The Chicago chapter shares a
building with the national office
of Students for a Democratic So-
ciety (SDS) and publishes “Vet-
erans Stars and Stripe-s for
Peace,” which is sent free to ser-
vicemen and can be bought for
$5 for “the duration of the war”
by civilians.

Despite the central location and

‘ publishing function of the Chica-
I go group, one of its members, Ro-

bert Trinka, says, “There is no
central organization and no cen-
tral philosophy other than end-
ing the war.” He says 30 to 40
veterans regularly attend Vets
for Peace meetings in Chicago
and about 200 feel an affiliation.
“They join for their own rea-
sons,” says Trinka. “Some want
an immediate pullout; others’ talk
of negotiations. We don’t pro-
mote any phi1osophies—we just
want to end the killing.” '

One of the organ'ization’s tasks

is to counteract the impression.
— given by groups like the Ameri-

can Legion and the Veterans of
Foreign Wars that veterans are
all for the war. There arelother
differences, too. “The Legion isn’t
serious in its approach to things.”
says one Vet for Peace. “They
sponsor wedding receptions, par-
ties, and dances. We are a one-
issue organization working to-
ward the day when we can dis-
band and live normal lives again.
We are trying to do something

‘ really constructive.” . . . . . . . . .

The first Vets for Peace chap-
ter started about a year and since
then the scope of activities has
broadened as well as the mem-
bership. In East Lansing, Michi-
gan, the group participated in a
drive to get ROTC off the Michi-
gan State University campus. In
Madison, Wis., a Korean War
veteran contributed a front-page
article on the horrors of napalm
to the Capital Times, while in
Detroit the chapter drew some
600' people to hear Admiral True
condemn the war.

On Oct. 21, anti-war demon-
strators cheered a delegation of
about 2,000 veterans who par-
ticipated in the march on the
Pentagon.

One of the strengths of the or-
ganization is that, having slogged
in the mud themselves they can
empathize with the plight of U.S.
servicemen as other anti-war or-
ganizations cannot. A recent Stars
and Stripes for Peace editorial
reads: “American’s vets want you
all home safe in a country at
peace when next year's holidays
roll around, and we'll break our
backs to make sure that’s how it

I will be. Meanwhile, good luck,

men!”

 

Student Policies Reviewed

NSA’s Schwartz Sues
Draft Director Hershey

by PHIL SEMAS
College Press Service
, WASHINGTON (CPS)—National Student Association (NSA) Presi-
dent Ed Schwartz was holding a press conference at the Willard Hotel,

two blocks from the White House.

After he had announced that NSA and three other student groups
were suing Selective Service Director, Lewis B. Hershey, the report-
ers began their questions. “Mr. Schwartz,” asked one, “it is a matter
of public record that your organization received funds from the CIA.
Could you tell us what changes have come about since these ties were

revealed?”

Schwartz said nothing for a
moment, then grinned, “It’s not
only part of the public record,
it's beginning to sound like a
broken record."

It  No matter what NSA
holds a press conference about-'-
the draft, student power, or even
student travel—some reporter is
bound to ask about the CIA. An
N S A staff member who tells
where he works knows he faces
the inevitable question, “How’s
the CIA?” Some staff members
are beginning to tire of it. There
are other things NSA ought to be
known for, they say.

That’s true, yet NSA is stiu not
averse to using the notoriety it
gained from the CIA revelations
to get publicity for its other ac-
tivities. NSA now —means some-
thing to most people and the ini-
tials capture the attention of busy
newspaper readers.

The public first became aware
of NSA’s secret benefactor on the

morning of February 14, 1967, in
a Ramparts magazine ad on page
31 of the New York Times. The
story unfolded that day and for
the next several days on the front
page of the Times and the rest
of the nation’s newspapers. Until
11965 NSA had received about 80
per cent of its funds from the
Central Intelligence Agency with
the complete knowledge of top
NSA officers. NSA staff members
had provided the CIA with infor-
mation on student groups in oth-

er countries.

In the fall of 1965 NSA’s new
president, Phil Sherburne, had
begun the process of ending the
relationship. He began cutting
back NSA’s reliance on CIA mon-
ey, searching for other sources
of funding. Sherburne’s succes-
sor, W. Eugene Groves‘, finished
the liquidation of the relationship.
NSA now made a full public ac-
counting of its income, and S01
Stern, who wrote the original
Ramparts article, agrees that
there is no indication that NSA
is «receiving any more CIA funds.

Controversy abounded in the
wake of the revelations. NSA offi-
cers said they planned to reveal
the relationship eventually. Ram-
parts and others argued that they
wouldn’t have. Right wing groups
such as Young Americans for
Freedom complained because
they had missed out on the CIA
largesse. Journalists James
Ridgeway and Andrew Kopkind
and others said NSA was a “dem-

 

ocratic mutant" and suggested
that it should disband. Predic-
tions came from right and left
that NSA would fold.

But in the ensuing weeks and
months it became clear that the
predictions of NSA’s death were
wrong, or at least premature. On-
ly one school, Brandeis Univers-
ity, dropped out of the organiza-
tion and NSA membership has
grown from 285 on Feb. 14, 1967,
to 335 on Feb. 8,1968.

As it became clear NSA was
going to live for a while, the sig-
nificant issue began to emerge.

When the CIA was providing
most of NSA’s income, the organ-
ization’s real constitutency was
the CIA. It had little to do with
the real lives of American stu-
dents. Though NSA had expand-
ed its domestic role under Sher-
burne and Groves, a good deal
of their effort had been spent
ending the CIA relationship and
their efforts were fairly haphaz-
ard. Now that the CIA mess was
over with, would NSA change its
programs?

The NSA officers said the an-
swer could be- yes. Left wing
groups such as Student for a
Democratic Society didn’t agree.

The final word was expected to

come from NSA’s annual National
Student Congress. More than 1,-

_.200 students gathered at the Uni-

versity of Maryland Aug. 13-16
for the largest NSA Congress
ever.

The Congress passed the most
radical resolutions of any in his-
tory. The delegates were against
the draft, for black power, and
against the Vietnam war. More
significant was a clear call for
NSA to emphasize domestic pro-
grams and make its international
activities relevant to students.

But the delegates rejected num-
erous proposals for a major over-
haul of NSA’s structure, often cri.
ticized as undemocratic. SDS held
a counter-conference with many
of the radical speakers NSA had
originally invited. But most of the
delegates found SDS’s abolish
NSA position irrelevant.

It was therefore left to NSA’s
officers and staff to build a set
Of programs relevent and useful
enough to enable students to have
a more significant impact on the
American society. If they could

succeed, then NSA itself might
also continue to exist.

’TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY

Yuletide is almost upon us. Let's stop wasting time in
classes and get on with our Christmas shopping. Follow-
ing are a number of gift suggestions, all easily obtainable
at your nearest War surplus boutique.

First, a most unusual gift idea, brand new this year ,
and certain to please everyone on your list—a gift cer-
tiﬁcate from the American Veterinary Medicine Associa-
tion! Each certiﬁcate is accompanied by this charming

poem :

M erry Christmas, north and south,
Does your cow have hoof and mouth ?

And your dog, fidele semper,

H e1'e’s a cure for his distemper.
Little kitten, cute and squirmy,

 

 

Bring her in. I think she’s wormy.

Yb bunnies, turtles, parrots green,
Joyeux Noel! H eureux Vaccine!

 

Are you wondering what to give that extra—special man
on your list? Stop wondering. Give him that extra-special
shaving combination, Personna Super Stainless-Steel
Blades and Burma Shave. Each gift is accompanied by

this charming poem:

Christmas merry, New Year bonny,
From your friendly blade Personny.

You will have the ladies fawning,
I f you’re shaving with Persawning.

Injector style or double edges,
Both arebmade by good Persedges.

And Burma-Shave in plain or menthol,
Leaves your face as smooth as renthol.

(NOTE: As everyone knows, renthol is the smoothest
substance ever discovered. You may not know, however,
that renthol is named after its inventor, Ralph Waldo
Renthol, who developed it by crossing a swan with a ball

bearing. )

(Interestingly enough,,Mr. Renthol did not start out
to be an inventor. Until age 50 he was a Western Union
boy. Then fate took a hand. One day while delivering a
singing telegram to a girl named Claudia Sigafoos, Ralph
noted to his surprise that the telegram was signed
“Claudia Sigafoos!” She had sent herself a birthday

greeting !

(When pressed to explain, Claudia told Ralph a heart-
rending tale. It seems that when she was only six weeks
old, her parents were killed in an avalanche. The infant
Claudia was found by a pair of kindly caribou who raised
her as their own. They taught her all they knew—like how
to rub bark off a tree and which lichens are better than
other lichens—but in time they saw that this was not
enough. When Claudia reached age 18, they entered her

in Bennington.

(Unused to people, Claudia lived a lonely life—so lonely,
in fact, that she was reduced to sending herself birthday

greetings, as we have seen.

(Ralph, deeply touched, married Claudia and tried his
best to make her mingle with people. It didn’t work. They
went nowhere, saw no one, except for an annual Christmas
visit to Claudia’s foster parents, Buck and Doe. To while
away his long, lonely hours, Ralph ﬁnally built a work
bench and started to futz around with inventions, as we

have seen.

(It is pleasant to report that the story of Ralph and
Claudia ends happily. After the birth of their two chil-
dren, Donder and Blitzen, Claudia joined the PTA and
soon overcame her fear of people. Ralph joined the Elks.)

But I digress. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good

night ! Ho-ho-ho !

I’ -I I’

Carnegie-Mellon Presents
Chaplain’s First Sound Film 

Charlie Chaplin's ﬁrst sound
ﬁlm, The Great Dictator, will be
given its ﬁrst Pittsburgh show-
ing in over 20 years Tuesday at
7, 9, and 11 p.m. in the Wherett
Room at Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity. Called by Bosley Crow-
ther of the New York Times,
“Perhaps the most signiﬁcant
ﬁlm ev-er produced” in the Unit-
ed States, The Great Dictator is
a merciless satire, in the true

Chaplin tradition, of the idio-
cies of fascist governrrn-ents in
general, and Nazi Germany in
particular.

The Great Dictator stars
Charlie Chaplin as both the lit-
tle Jewish barber who is ﬂeeing
for his life, and as Adolf Hyn-
kel, who thro-ugh some strange
twist of fate, looks just like the
little Jewish barber, and is,
eventually, replaced by him.

Secret Research Continues

Opposition Has Little Effect

by WALTER GRANT

WASHINGTON (CPS)—-
Although opposition to se-
cret research on university
campuses has increased dur-
ing the past six months, the
Pentagon claims universi-
ties have no-t responded by back-
ing down on the-ir classiﬁed re-

search agreements.

In fact, a Defense Depart-
ment official said some college
and university administrations
have responded by writing the
Pentagon expressing their will-
ingness to take on secret re-
search projects, or to increase
the number they now have.
These administrations apparent-
ly want to make their po~sitions
exceedingly cle-ar in case some
universities decide to drop their
classiﬁed projects.

Dr. Arwin A. Dougal, assis-
tant director of the Pentagon’s
office for research and engi-
neering, would not say how
many universities have express-
ed an interest in conducting se-
cret research. He also declined
to list speciﬁc schools which
have written the Pentagon in
this regard.

He did, however,,indicate that
the number of schools express-
ing a willingness to conduct se-
cret research outweighs the
number expressing concern over
whether or not universities
should engage in such projects.

Dougal conceded that some
university administrations, rec-
ognizing the possibility that
some schools may discontinue
their secret Defense Depart-
ment projects, are gnabbing for
the research dollar. “Some of
them may be like good business-
men who _are_ always trying to
get more business,” he said.

But Dougal says the “large
majority” o-f the lettens have
shown the universities “have a
sincere concern about the na-
tional security.” These universi-
ties have indicat-ed they realize
that classiﬁed research, al-
though possibly undesirable, is
necessary for this nation’s se-
curity, he said.

Dougal, said he can sympa-
thize with the opponents of se-
cret research on university cam-
puses. “But many aspects of
Defense research simply have
to be withhheld from foreign
knowledge, and the only way
we can do that is to classify the
project. We do not arbitrarily
declare that a project has to be
kept secret.”

Defense Department research
is conducted in four basic sec-
tors: in-house De-fen-se research
laboratories; industries; Feder-
al Research Contract Centers,
and universities. “The unvers»i-
ty sector is one of the very
strongest sectors,” Dougal said.

Dougal also said many pro-
fessors who have been involved
in secret research projects at-
tempt to retain their security
clearnaces when their projects
are completed. “Many attempt
to get involved in conducting
more classiﬁed research, and
others want to serve as advi-
vers to research laboratories,”
he explained. ‘

In the past two months, there
have been some indications that
the government has been re
sponding to the protests against
classiﬁed research by easing its
policies toward secrecy. Two
speciﬁc events support this

 trend. They are:

>The Pentagon announced
that it is “declassifying” some
projects now underway at uni-
versities. But the anynouncﬁmeﬂt
      P *   eta-ss1ﬂsi.P  

   

  

ects in the area of basic re-
search, and most secret research
falls under the category of ap-
plied research.

>The State Department an-
nounced that it has drawn up an
anti-secrecy code designed to ap-
ply to all research in the‘ be-
havioral and social sciences and
research on foreign countries.
Twenty-one government agen-
cies, including the Defense De-
partment, the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, and the Execu-
t-ive Office of the Pre-side-nt say
they will abide by the Code.
. But Dougal cautioned against
interpreting the two announce.
ments as meaning the govern-
ment is softening its position on
secret research. “There are many
projects which simply have to
be classiﬁed,” he said. “What
these announcements show is
that there is a desire to not
classify projects when it is not
necessary.”

The Pentagon announcement
came in early November, when
the opposition to classiﬁed re-
search was near its peak on
college campuses. “But you
should not be deceived by the
timing of the announcement,”
Dougal said.

The new Pentagon policy will
not have a signiﬁcant impact on

university research because only —

138 of the more than 4,000 basic
research projects were secret to
begin with.

The new anti-secrecy code an-
nounced by the State Depart-
ment also affects only a small
amount of research. It does not
include any natural science re-
search, nor does it include re-
search done Within the ‘United
States. There are no provisions
for enforcement; agreement is
voluntary.

Engineers
Loom Tough

by ROY JACOBS

Dave Adams was hoping
to catch the cat napping to-
morrow night when his
wrestlers host Lehigh, but Army
spoiled his chances. Army sur-
prised the Engineers last Sat-
urday, and it is doubtful that
Lehigh will take the Panther
wrestlers lightly.

The main event at the Field
House starts at 8 p.m., but there
is an almost equally important
freshman meet at 6 p.m., pitting
the ﬁrst-year men of each school
against each other.

“Army be-at Lehigh Satur-
day,” reviewed coach Adams. ‘‘I
was hoping we’d catch them
sleeping, but they’ll be snorting
now. They’ll be after us. I
thought we could pull a Prince-
ton.”

Earlier this season, Princeton
upset the Engineens. Army won
the heavyweight bout to clinch
the win. Oklahoma and Navy
also beat Lehigh. That doesn’t
leave much room for another
upset.

‘They're going to come after
us looking for bear,” empha-
sized Adams. “I can't remember

. the last time Lehigh lost four

meets. I imagine it was pretty
far back. There could still be a
ﬁfth loss, though. They have
Penn State coming up yet.”
The 1-ast time Lehigh lost that
many in one season was 1959-
60. In the next six years they

lost a combined total of eight.
.The Engineers have lost more

than three times in a season
-only eight times sin-ce 1909.

“There’s nothing for the boys
to be scared of,” assured Adams.
“We don’t have anything to lose
against Lehigh. We'll go right
after them.”

Lehigh won its 19th Eastern
championship last year, but its
two individual champions are
gone. The famed Mike Oaruso

HEAVYWEIGHT TERRY Hoover ended the Frank-
lin and Marshall meet last Saturday by pinning
Tomorrow against Lehigh,

  

neither he nor the rest of the matmen will have as

lost only once in three varsity
seasons at 123 while Joe Peri-
to-re, who was supposed to wres-
tle h-ere, but went to Lehigh at
the last minute, was a two-time
EIWA champion. Despite their
loss, the Engineers are still very
tough.

Back from the championship
squad of last season a-re Elliott
Tepper (145 or 152), Jon Rus-
hatz (167), Ron Ries (191), and
heavyweight Frank Paquin.
Ooach Gerry Leeman has ﬁlled
several other gaps With top
sophomores.

“(Bruce) Unangst will have
his toughest match to date,”
forecasted Adams about his
Easterns hopeful at 123. “They
have a sophomore, Meyers, who’s
only lost to Burger of Navy, to
Oklahoma, and wrestling 130 to
Princeton.” Other leadings sophs
-are Koenig at 145, Muir at 160,
and Bentz at 177.

Of course, the wrestlers’ best
chances come early. Unangst at
123 is 5-0-1, and Dick Shildt at
7-1 at 130. Larry Cuba is hav-
ing a good year at 137, while
Ron Schuchert is 4-1-1 at 145.

“”I’m very pleased with our
starters,” said Adams earlier
this week. “If you win three of
the first four all the time, you’re
in good shape.”

Sports Editor

The search for a new head basketball coach is on. Or
is it? Athletic Director Frank Carver admitted earlier in
the week that a screening committee hasn't been appoint-
ed. “We’ll probably meet sometime next week,” Carver re-

vealed.

\\ Appare-ntly the Athletic Department isn’t going to
break any land speed records in finding the right man for
the _]ob.ACarver thought that March 15 sounded like a
reasonable time, but he hinted that the search might take

longer.

Carver feels that because recruits aren’t committed
until the middle of May, there’s no rush in hiring a new
coach. But he’s wrong. Basketball players recruited by
Duke or Davidson aren’t going to be sold on Pitt by Bob
Timmons. The kids are going to want to know who their

coach is going to be.

Carver says Pitt has three or four decent area ball;flay-
ers inte.rested. _Unless a coach is appointed within the month,
those players, if they are of top quality, aren’t going to hold
off their decision. They’ll be getting the hard sell from else-
where and Pitt’s “sit tight” won’t do much good.”

But Carver, the eternal optimist, noted that “Bob
and Tim Grgurich have said they would continue to re-
cruit.” Grgurich of course, remains the number one can-
didate and apparently the only thing he has against him

is coaching inexperience.

Carver included a winning record, experience and per-
sonality as three of the key factors the committee will be,

looking for in a coach.

 

airs

_—He, estimated that between 20-25 applications have

    

easy a time of it as last week. Hoover will draw
either Ron Ries at 191 or Frank Paquln, Lehigh’s
heavyweight. Either will be quite a challenge.

F rosh Runners Face
Ohio Here Tomorrow

Tomorrow afternoon many record-breaking tracksters
will make their final home appearance ‘as freshmen. The
Ohio University frosh will meet the Junior runners 1n the

Field House at 1:30 pm.

Once again Jerry Richey, Bryant Salter and Dave Garnett will
lead the star-studded team in a quest of the few records as yet un-
broken. But serious challenges from within the ranks are expected.

A change in events calls for the 440 yard dash to Open the meet-
An easygoing runner named Smitty J. Brown will challenge the
Ohioans, and the result could be a new record.

Had Brown gone to any other
school this year, his name would
probably be on top of freshman
hopefuls. But here, the Coraopolis
high school star who holds the
state class B 440 record, is in the
shadow of Richey, Salter, and
Garnett.

Brown already has nailed down
the frosh 600 yard record, and is
a member of the record-holding
frosh mile relay team. Another
member of that mile relay team
could be the star at another
school, too.

Elliott Drysdale (that’s Elliott
with two 1's and two t’s) runs on
the relay team after he partici-
pates in the hurdles. Drysdale, or
“the Fog” as some of his team-
mates call him, excells in both.

The lanky freshman works hard
in practice, and “thinks” track
at all times. Another hard-work-
ing frosh who is in the shadow of
the stars is a sprinter who is
equally at home on the football
field or tennis court.

J. D. Lewis has spent many
long practice sessions working
with Garnett in the starting

Individuals
vs. Balance

If momentum can be passed
from freshmen on to the varsi-
ty, the ﬁrst year grapplers can
do themselves and their older
cohorts a service by beating the
Lehigh frosh in tomorrow's
opener at 6 p.m.

The Panther freshmen own 'a.i":

20-11 win o-ver California and
the Michigan Freshman Invita-
tional tournament title, but
coach Bob Fehrs indicated that
Lehigh’s balance might offset
his squad’-s in-dividusal strengths.
The frosh -are very strong
through the middle, with Jack
Hopkins at 137, Mark Payne at
145, on Lavery at 152, and Bob
Kuhn at 160. Ralph Cindrich is
doing a good job at heavyweight.
“Cindrich did a good job last
week against two really big
kids,” reviewed Fehrs. “He's got
a tough one this week. Their kid
Staub was in the state cham-
pionships last year, but he lost
to the eventaul champion. They
have a good 130 poumder, too.”
It should be quite an inter-
esting evening at the Field
House tomorrow night. In the
preliminary, wrestling fans get
a preview of P-tit’-s wrestling
future; in the night cap, a pos-
sible preview of the varsity‘s
chances in the Easterns.

FRESHMAN POLE vaulter Jeff Snyder works on
his vaulting technique in preparation for tomor- 
row’s meet with Ohio U.

blocks. Although the two sprinters
have finished close in previous
races, Garnett has won and has
been invited to Invitational
meets.

Add to the list of hard-working

stars who get little publicity the
names Jeff Snyder, pole vaulter;
Mike Nolan, distanceman; and
Rudy Hufnagl, and you still have
only half of the record-breaking
freshman team.-—Tiern-an

Swimmers Confront Indiana State

A tired looking coach Bill
Grant sat quietly in his
poolside office studying the
time sheets of tomorrow night’s
Trees Hall opponent, Indiana
State University at Terre Haute.
“Well,” he slowly said, “It looks
like another Temple.” Meet time
is 8 p.m.

Last week’-s Temple match
proved the closest and toughest
for the swimmers. The meet
came down to the last event,
the 400-yard freestyle relay, with
the mermen needing a victory
to tie the meet. The outcome of
the meet was 59-45, with the
swimmers on the shortend.

Grant hopes that tomorrow
the swimmers will show a rever-
sal of that form and come out
on top. “A good deal of how
we will fare will depend upon

Price and Gene Hoffman,” he
said. “Gene has the ﬂu, wh-ile
Chris is ﬁnally beginning to
shake it's effects. Their health
status will be a pivotal area for
our strategy. Three events hinge
on their condition.” These events
are the individual medley, the
breasts-tro-ke, and the all—im.por-
tant medley relay.

Coach Duane Barrows’ Indi-
ana Staters bring with them a
fairly strong and evenly bal-
anced team. “Their strength
seems to lie with their free-
stylers,” noted Grant. “We have
to get close to that winning to-
tal of 53 points before that free-
style relay.”

Grant expects most of the
races to be extremely close.
“The medley relay will be a
real ‘nip and tucker,” he said.
“The times are so similar be-

thing can hiappen.” He feels“ I I

that his swimmers may have an
edge in the 200-yard breaststroke
and the individual medley. Once
again he bases this on Price and
Hoffman being in good shape.
He gives the Sntaters a slight
nod in the freestyle events.
Bob Landgraff and Phil Bogan
lead Indiana's freestylers. Land-
graff, who comes from a fami-
ly of successful swimmers, is
their top freestyler in the 100
and 500. Began consistently does
under 12 minutes in the 1,000.
“Pete Ream will have to swim
his best race of the year to
give us’ some points,” «adds
G-rant.
With a little luck tomorrow

night, Grant feels that the swimmer,»-

mers will still be able to sal-
wage a “respectable” season and
maybe even ﬁnish at ca .500 lev-

 

    

 

 

 Ellis Breaks Shotput Record

narred by the shot hitting the
Field House wall. Even his rec-
ord-breaking throw came dan-
gerously close.

Ellis’ effort highlighted an
otherwise listless performance
by both teams. The Rockets’
contingent was reminiscent of
a tired girl scout troop return-
ing from a three week outing.

With a few exceptions, the
thinclads used just enough en-
ergy to defeat the troop from
Slippery Rock. One exception
was Skip 0rszulak’s start in
the 50 yard dash.

Orszulak had :a good two-yard
jump on the ﬁeld, but Chet
Wopiechowski passed Orszulak
at the 30-yard mark and held

a on for a win in a time of 5.5

seconds. The rocket runner pro-
tested, but he still ﬁnished third.

“Ma-c” M-cElheny, proving that
extra work pays off, high jump-
ed six foot to Win. McElheny
had put in extra pnactice the
past few weeks.

The “standing ‘around only”
crowd of 53 persons was speech-
less when a Rocket runner pass-
ed Paul Zink, Paul Greig and

Ken Lawton and won the mile.
But a deafening roar arose,
however, when the crowd learn-
ed that the runner was a fresh-
man and his time didn’t count.

Jack Neyer seemed to be the
only healthy distance runner -as
he won the 600 yard event in
1:13.2. In -so doing, he beat Ro-
ger Holly, who ran last Satur-
day in -the ﬁnal track meet in

the old Madison Square Gar-v

den. »

Holly may have felt -the same
nostalgia Wednesday as he
found in New York. Coach Jim
Banner as-ked Holly about the
race.

“Were you waiting for a
streetcar?” Banner asked. “No,”
Holly answered, “they don't run
anymore.”

Greig has yet to recover from
illness that kept him out of the
ﬁnst two meets. He looked tired
in the mile and the two-mile
event-s, -buat still hung on to win
the mile and ﬁnish second in
th-e two-mile.

Depends on the giant. Actually, some giants are just regular
kinds of guys. Except bigger.

And that can be an advantage.

How? Well, for one thing, you’ve got more going for
you. Take Ford Motor Company. A giant in an exciting
and vital business. Thinking giant thoughts. About the
proﬁt opportunities in Mustang. Cougar. A city car for
the future.

Come to work for this giant and you'll begin to think
like one.

Because you‘re dealing with bigger problems, the
consequences, of course, will be greater. Your responsibilities
heavier. That means your experience must be better——more
complete. And so, you’ll get the kind of opportunities only a
giant can give. ‘A

Giants just naturally seem to attract top professionals.
Men that you'll be working with, and for. Financial manage-
ment pros working hard to accelerate your advancement.

Because there’s more to do, you‘ll learn more. In more
areas. You may handle as many as three different assignments
in your first two years. _

You'll develop a talent for making hard-nosed, imagina-
tive decisions. And you'll know how these decisions affect
the guts of the operation. At the grass roots. Because you'll
have been there.

If you‘d like to be a giant yourself, and you’ve got
better ideas in ﬁnancial management, see the man from Ford
when he visits your campus. Or send your resume to Ford
Motor Company, College Recruiting Department.

You and Ford can grow bigger together.

Mercifully, there are only five games left in the bas-
ketball season. Fortunately, three of them are on the road,
including tomorrow night at Virginia.

After the debacle Tuesday night against Westminster, coach Bob
Timmons gave his players the next day off, to reflect over the type of
basketball they have been playing. If’ it did any good, the Panthers

should be able to give Virginia a
good ballgame.

The Cavaliers are not that
strong, and playing in a tough
conference (with North Carolina,
Duke, South Carolina, and N.C.
State) they have been under .500
all year.

. Chip Case, a junior guard, leads
Virginia in scoring a 16 point
average. Last year as a sopho-
more, Case had one of his best
games against the cagers, scoring
23 points.

If Paul Naponick is looking for
another quick knockout, he may
find the Cavaliers more trouble
than either Kent State or West-
minster. His older brother John

started against the Panthers last
seas-on, and hit for 18 points in
front of the home town fans. But,
this year, the regular center for
Virginia is Norm Carmichael.

Carmichael is not quite as big
as Big John who goes 6'8”, 270,
but he manages to get by at 6’8”,
230. However, he is not much of
a scorer, averaging less than ten
points a game. Carmichael scored
six last year when Virginia won
82-70. ‘

Charlie Hunt will start opposite
Carmichael. Against Westminster,
Hunt went to the basket for the
first time this year, and he fin-
ished with 16 points. However,
the Westminster center was much

BOWLERS ROLL

Hot after a bid to the rolloffs for the National Intercollegiate
Bowling Association national tournament, the bowling team visits
Clarion State tomo-rrow. The squad is currently 7-9 after four matches
(a possible four points per match); but if it can sweep its last two
matches 4-0, the 15-9 record would be good enough for a bid.

The keglers have been paced this season by captain Chris Fite,
who is backed by Rich Sternberg and Gil Burckart.

MBA Gains Easy Win Over Mets;
Delta Sig Hands Palace First Loss

by ED CONLEY

Two powerful basketball teams
kept winning this week, heard-
ing for their showdown in the
Al1—Campus title game. The Mas-
ters of Bus.ir'1ess‘Adminnilsltraztion
rolled over the Metallurgical En-
gineers, 58-45, and Delta Sigma
Phi edged past Pleasure Palace,
54-48, in the tourney’s semi-ﬁnal
games.

MBA was never threatened in
their game, as they played
isltrong offensively and defen-
fensively. The Mets could only
some from the outside and were
ulsulaully limited to the one shot

boards. A pressing defense
forced the Mets into numerous
turnovers which ultimately re-
sulted in the defeat.

The MBA starters were re-
moved with fo-ur minutes left
in the game and with a 54-37
lead. E

Bill DiPietro connected for 18
points and Kevin McGuinness
hit for eight points in MBA’s
successful effort.

The losers were topped by
Rich Bened~et.t'i’s 20 points and
Bill Clark's 18 points. -

The frat~dorm game was much
closer. Delta Slilg’s victory was

utes of the game, and they had
to come from a two-poinit (25-23.)
half-time deﬁcit to gain the win.

The top guns from both teams
fought to a stalemate in their
scoring duel. Joe McCain of Del-
ta Big and Warren of Pleasure
Palace performed to their us-
ual peaks, matching 18 points.

Allen didn’t get as much help
from his teammates as did Mc-
Clain, however. Chuck Winters
contributed 15 and Carry Tra-
chak added ten as Delta Sig
continued to show the big scor-
ing punch.
