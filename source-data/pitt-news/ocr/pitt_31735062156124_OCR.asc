Discrimination To Be Probed
Rabinowitz and Melvin Forst
were assigned to investigate dis-
crimination at Pitt as a result of
last year’s furor over the discrim-

inatory attitude of some fraterni-

ties.

Theinvestigation Forst and Rab-
inowitz conducted probed. several
of the country’s leading colleges
on how they handled the discrim-
ination. problem. ’

“At Pitt,” said Rabinowitz,” the
surveywas not successful because
the-clauses in fraternity constitu-
tions barring people for racial or
religious reasons strangely disap-
peared.” .

. ‘ Goldstein Opposes

Rabinowitz met with solid oppo-
sition from Morton Goldstein who
said in effect that no honorary,
professional, or departmental fra-
ternity on campus has a clause
barring anyone from their ranks
for anything other than scholastic
reasons.

He went on to say that
the problem, of discrimination
concerns social fraternities and

_is beyond the jurisdiction of-
Men’s Council and should be
referred to Interfraternity Coun-
cil. “This whole issue,”, said
Goldstein,” is giving theschool
a black eye.”

Campus Poll Shows

Students For Panthers

"By NANCY COOK

City council last week slammed the door on live panther.

mascots at Pitt football games. In spite of the University’s
assurance that adequate safety precautions would be taken
during the exhibition of the animals, City‘ Council voted to

refuse to consider the contract be-
tween the city and the .Univ,er-
sity. ’

The stalemate has prévoked
widespread student discussion and
the following opinions were ob-
tained in the query, “What do you
think should be done about the
Council’s action on the panther
issue?” ‘

Phyllis Kephart, College, ’53—
“There are a lot of other things
which Pitt could do to beneﬁt the
students other than live panthers.
For instance, obtaining activities
admission cards for visiting
friends of students.”

Jean ’Hill, Bus Ad, ’54—“City
council is now acting contrary to
what they seemed to advocate last

 

“Pssstzt
year. I favor ‘radio discussion?)
plead the student’s case.”

Al Lefkowitz, College, ’53—-“A
new skin for the student panther

whether fraternities and certain other campus organizations

by student governing .bodies and the organizations in ques-

left hanging in the air. Two;_"I_nembers of Men’s Councilhave

Billy Graham has left Oakland
but the parking troubles haven’t.
Last week, a ‘couple of unsus-

beneﬁt of warning signs, parked
in Schenley Plaza. Needless to
say, when they returned from
classes, their car was surrounded
by autos of all shapes and sizes
bearing Billy Graham fans; and
the fellows were marooned. So

students.
Hundreds’ of Cars

Every morning, hundreds of
cars literally pour‘into Oakland.
The early birds get the free spots.
But if you happened to sleep in a
bit or had "one too many red
lights, or—-heaven forbid-——have a
9:30 class, then, oh*"rich students,
you pay to _park. ‘

Now ,let’s be reasonable about
this. V There are only so many

parking spots in the plaza and.‘

only so many side streets free of
no parking signs or meters where
a student can leave‘ that jalopy
or new Buick. So, what hap-
pens to the rest of the drivers?

Reds Will s+op .

The view taken by the Demo-
cratic candidate, on the other
hand, seems to be that, even
though Communismdoes want
eventual world domination, they
will' stop short of all-out war to

achieve it, working, rather,
through economic and social
forces". ‘

_ ,I»f Governor Stevens__on’s .view

tlt is obvious that a more ag-
gressive. policy than we have
been following carries with it the

examine his words. _

Sen. Nixon, who moved Alger
Hiss from Washington to the
penitentiary, revealed that the
communists and the communist
press are praising Gov. Steven-
son apd blasting Eisenhower.

Eisenhower is Target
“Dwight Eisenhower is Russia’s

.Public Enemy Number One,” he

disclosed. Nixon also pointed
out how the commie attacks are
similar in content to those of the
campaigning Democrats". There’s
really, be implied, not much dif-

ference between the two." In sub-‘

stance Nixon repeated an earlier
speaker’s assertion that we not

only have to “kickout the com- -

munistsin Washington, but We
_have to kick out the people wh

.l put them there.” ' -

—WIf all- this .is true, the issue
-seems clear.. Pitt Young Dem_o-
crats are undeniably backing

iqstevenson for the presidency.

On the other hand, history has
proven that compromise and co-
_existence does not always guar-
antee “peace in our time,” as it
was supposed to do in 1938 when

\England, particularly Chamber-

lain, favored the Munich com-
promise._

We Must Choose .

It must be left up to future
generations to decide whether?
"one policy or another was right
or wrong, but it is the task of
the present-to choose, and choose
now.

Realizing the seriousness of
this _si_tuation, all Pitt students
should take every opportunity to
hear all sides of_ the question.
For most of us, that means par-
ticipation in Political Week, be-
ginning Oct 27. This twill not

only be an" opportunity to prac- V

tice politics at its grass—roots
level, but maybeour only chance
to decide “Whichrisk totake?"

Out!  

Are they not, then, backing  _

their activities skirt close to

treason, for if the Democrats are ,

pro-Red, they can not be pro-
American at the same time. Are
we going to permit subversives to
‘function on campus.
Axe the Democrats
Of course, there is a chance
that the Reds are fooling us.
Perhaps they, too, like Ike, and
so are publicly favoring Steven-
son. If FBI evidence should re-

veal this to be the case, then the a

young GOP should. be axed. _

To play it safe, though, the
Young Democrats should be
eliminated. The authorities can
look into the latter possibilityat
some other time. The vital thing
is to act now before it is too late.

the Oklahoma victory over Pitt as a massacre seem to forget
that Pitt did very well for themselves up until the last

' quarter when lack of reserves began to tell on the men

river. Since the water level fluctuated
40 feet between normal and ﬂood stages,
it was necessary ‘to evaluate several plans

fearless Four Set To Romp-  

By WILL

‘After last week’s performance against Texas, N otre
Dame’_s fearless foursome, Ralph Guglielmi, J oe Heap, John
Lattner, and Neil Worden make the Irish a decided 14-point

‘ favorite against Pitt at South Bend tomorrow.

After a mediocre showing against Penn two weeks ago
and a somewhat pitiful showing in the ﬁrst-half of last week’s
encounter with Texas, the Irish ﬁnally “found themselves”

Pitt defense with a busy after-

Labeled “Ironman” for his do-
ings, Lattner has averaged over

five yards per carry and is one

of Quarterback‘ Gug1ielrni’s ‘fav-
oritetargets when the Irish take
to the airlanes. Besides handling
the South Benders’ punting chores,
Lattner is rated" a top—notch de-
fensive . back.

Another of Leahy’s lads who
will annoy the Panthers tomorrow
will be sophomore Guglielmi, who
rose to stardom against Southern
California in the 1951 ﬁnale. Gug-
lielfni, following in the footsteps

’ of a long line of ﬁne Notre Dame

quarterbacks, is a threat both as
’aI passer and a runner. Should
Guglielmi ‘need a breather, an-

takes over without weakening the

Non Nomens as

JDeSota Hall’s six-A-man touch
football team opened its season
with a bang by defeating the Non

' Nomens, 12-7.

Emmett Powell sparked the De-
sota’s attack with his clutch pass-
ing and running. Powell scored
his team’s ﬁrst touchdown and
passed for the second TD to Frank

. Demetri.

It was Powe1l’s 21-yard sprint
that gave the DeSota’s a six point
lead for three quarters until the
victors increased their lead in the
ﬁnal quarter.

After -three successful passes
that put the DeSota’s in striking
distance, Demetri took the fourth
flip for a touchdown and a more
comfortable lead, 12-0.

 Non N omens, unable to do much
up to his point, now roared back
to strike paydirt.

Joe Shields’ long pass-to Billy
Carr put the Nomens on the De-

‘ Sota’s two-yard line. Shields hit

I-Iemy Daubner in the end zone
for a touchdown on the next play.

Larry Mu1hern’s leaping catch
of another Shields’ pass gave the

turning Panther lettermen will re-
call his sterling performance at
the Stadium, leading his team to
a 33-0 win. Another bruiser, Dan
Shannon, will see some action on
offense, although being primarily
a linebacker. —

Joe Heap, speed merchant from
New Orleans, will open at left-
half ‘for Notre Dame. His touch-
down last week against Texas
clinched the Irish win. Sharing
the post with Heap will be Mc-
Keesport’s Fran Paterra, who has
displayed ﬂashes of being a great
runner.
Paving the way for these run-
ners in the Irish quest of victory
14 in 20 games with the Panthers
will be a line averaging 202
pounds. Led by Captain Jack Ales-

Irish forwards stopped numerous

Pitches for Pitt

Harriers Seek, 3rd. VVin
Against USU Tomorrow

. By DAVE MAZER .

. With the ﬁrst _two conditioning meets over, Coach Carl
Olson’s harriers go after their eighth consecutive victory
tomorrow at 11 a.m. at Schenley Park when they engage a

strong‘Ohio State squad.
' Olson would not comment on
the prospects of winning the meet
but did say, “I don’t think any-
body on the Ohio State team will
beat Bernie Luterancik.”

Captain Luterancik, who holds
the Pitt course record of 22:08.7,
is considered the_team’s “clutch”
runner since he runs best under
pressure. ‘ , ,,
Fritz To Start

Other starters for the Blue-and—_
Gold include Dick Weber, Don
Delli Gatti; ,R_on'Sallade, Dan Som-
mer, Don Doyle, and Chuck Fritz.

The latter three earned start-
ing' positions for this meet at
time trials Tuesday. Sommer ﬁn-
ished in 23:53 for the best time.

Fritzi will be making his ﬁrst
start while the other two have
competed in previous races.

Although this will be the ﬁrst
meet for the Buckeyes, Olson un-
derstands that they have three or
four good runners.

Frosh Beat Tech

i Leading the Buckeyes will be
Bob Caldran who beat Delli Gatti
in the two-mile run at the in-
door track meet held at the Field

Epps Leads Scorers

Dawson plans to start his regu_
lar backﬁeld with Epps, Reynolds,
Mattioli, and Bill Hoffman, the
passer who‘ shares left halfback
duties with Johnny Jacobs. This
offensive has accounted for all but
one of the TD’s———Epps with three,
and Reynolds, Mattioli, and Jac-

Pete Neft accounted for the "other.
The defensive unit has received
a tremendous boost with Captain

the center once again. The key
play-stopper has been out since
banging his knee in the Iowa
victory. ,

But the Panthers will still feel
the absence of kicker and line-
backer George Blanda,‘who is not
fully recovered from a torn knee
ligament. Paul Chess and Joe
Zombek are slated to do the punt-
ing, with George Glagola ﬁlling in
as linebacker.

Defense Weak

The big weakness, besides the
lack of depth, seems to lie in de-
fense, which has permitted the
opposition to tally nine touch-
downs in two games.. A major
portion of the practice sessions
this week dwelt on stemming this
leakage.

Dawson moved his headquar-
ters to Trees Field Monday, after
spending the previous weeks at
Ellsworth Field, and has been
conducting private drills in the
Field House, after studying Notre
Dame reports brought back by
Scouts Bill Kern and Bob .Davis.

The so—called glamorous, basketball-like offense _that
Len Casanova brought here in-1950 has been altered by the
new regime. ‘ 2

to the basic manuevers.-in the Iowa ‘opener. They felt that since the

End Coach Bob Timmons had the answer, though, and threw
those observers for a loss. “We ran only three or four basic plays
because they were working so well,” Timmons explained. “There
was no sense in trying anything else. Iowa could have done. much
better if they would have stuck to the plays that gained well, in-
