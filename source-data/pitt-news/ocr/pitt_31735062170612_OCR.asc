Planning Task Forces Created

Administration Opens Input Channels

by RALPH DEAN
A major stop towards involving

students in University planningf

was taken Dec. 7. when a meeting
was held to introduce represen-

\tatives from the various grad-

uate areas of study to a new chan-
nel of communication with the ad-
ministration. The establishment
of three Planning Task Forces.
with student representation. was
announced by Sharon. Novak. a

student member of the Board of I

Trustees.

‘position papers from these coni-

- mittees (to which input from stu-

dents should be directed). then

WPGH/Marathon Benefit 
AidspChildrens Hospital

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN
Since noon last Friday the atmosphere of the Towers Lobby has
been "altered“ by the presence of disc-jockeys from WPGH. the Uni-
yersity‘s student radio station. who have been presenting a .\Iarathon

Benefit for Children's Hospital.

The Marathon. in the words of Jeff Pasek. a station Executive
Board member. is "primarily to raise money for the hospital but will

also publicize the station's change of frequency and let students be- ’
come lamiliai‘ with the disc-jockeys."

;

Pasek, pessimistic about newspaper coverage of the Marathon,
said, “You can’t write about a radiostation you have to take part in it.
Seeing the DJ’s in the process of doing the program will make them
seem real, will allow students to take part in the station.”

Last year‘s Marathon raised over $200. which’according to Pasek.
"was really great considering.how much money students usually give
to institutions like the Children‘s Hospital." . -

But according to Larry Manoff. production director of \\'PGll. and
a member of the Executive Board. this yearﬂs total amount raised will
probably be better since "last year paper donations were rare. while

_ this year they are quite common."

Manoff went on to explain that help for the Children’s Hospital
Benefit has come from manv quarters: “Chancellor Posvar came down
todo a plug for us and Szabo, the food service, has been really great
about supplying the DJ’s with food and refreshments.”

"We‘ve been having some other problems though." added Manotl.
“The transmitter for the Quadrangle dorms arrived broken. and since
station programming comes up through the electrical wires in the
building by means of these transmitters. we have only been able to

reach Towel‘ dormitory students."

his students said. "This is really something. the Sunday atmosphere

“The purpose of the walking
patrol team is to create a safer
environment not only in the Stu-
dent Union’ but also in its
rounding area. *

"From mid-morningwto mid-at'-
ternoon. a guard will be stationed
inthe Student Union. In the eve-
ning. there will be a walking pa-
trol team in and out of the building
and a sergeant in the building.“

According to William Markus.
Associate Dean of Student Af-
fairs. the change was made to
improve the utilization of man

ity of the area. we_wouldn‘t have

Terry ,Milani, Student Union
Manager said", “Tlie two-officer
patrols will be in constant radio
contact with Varsity Hall, "the
University Police headquarters.
Ifthere is any problem at the Stu-
dent Union or near the building,
someone in the building will con-
tact Varsity Hall, ’and the patrol
will be notified from there.” A

“The security of the building
and its occupants has not been
hindered in any way.“

Administration Refuses to Communicate

Executive Privilege Challenged

by HARRISON HUMPHREIS
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON lAP)—The Nix-
on administrations refusal to ex-
plain its massive bombing of
North Vietnam has provoked
stormv complaints from congres-
sional leaders about the use of ex-
ecutive privilege.

Democratic chairmen of Senate
committees complain of being
snubbed and accused President
Nixon of assuming a dictatorial
role in government.

Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield of.Montana says Con-
gress has a constitutional respon-
sibility for war and the funding
of domestic activities and is en-
titled to the information on which
to base its decisions. Presidents,
on the other hand, have claimed
the right of executive privilege,

or the power to refuse to testify
before Congress or to have top
aides testify.

Twice in the past ‘week admin-
istration officials refused to come
before congressional committees
to be questioned in detail about
the December breakdown in Viet-
nam peace negotiations and the
12-day bombing campaign that fol-
lowed.

Secretarv of State William P.
Rogers and presidential advisor
Henry A. Kissinger were said to
be unavailable to the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee Tues-
dav. and the'State Department de-
clined to send anvone to a House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee
hearing Thursday. The State De-
partment said it would be inappro-
priate for Rogers to testifv when
negotiations were just resuming.

world.”

Come Out—Come Together is the theme of Gay Students at
Pitt (GSP)’s first meeting of the term, this Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
in 524 SU. One of the newest groups on campus, GSP serves many
functions at the University and in the community-at-large.

GSP exists as a meeting place for gays, bisexuals, and friends
to talk about the problems of coming out (admitting your sexuality
to yourself, friends, and community)._and developing a “Gay and
Proud” consciousness to deal with them. Social functions, such as
coffee houses, dances, and a Gay Winter Weekend at a state park
are being planned. Equally important are GSP’s political/educa-
tional activities, in which they speak to the straight community
about being gay. Members have appeared at several Pitt classes,
churches, and have spoken on a four hour phone-in radio show on‘

. Future plans‘ include similar activities with KDKA, and talks at
high schools. But you don't have to be an activitist to come—GSP
is just as concerned with free people, without society's damaging
and mistaken stereotypes. GSP offers a human alternative-to clos-
ets, bar life and “faggot and butch” labels. “Gay, bisexual, human-
sexual, unsure, or iust interested—together we can change our

Meetings are every Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in 524 SU. This
week refreshments will be served.

\

The snub figured in the 36-12
vote of Senate Democrats Thurs-
day to support legislation that
would cut off funds for U.S. par-
ticipation in the Indochina war if
negotiations resuming in Paris
fail to produce a settlement by
Jan. 20, when President Nixon
starts his second term.

And it reopened old wounds.
Chairman J. W. Fulbright of the
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee said the Tuesdav meeting
on Vietnam. without a witness
from the executive branch. was
devoted largely to the question of
how to open communications with
the administration.

The committee could take re-
taliatorv action. such as holding
up a State Department authoriza-
tion bill. Fulbright said. but he
described such a move as pettv.
adding: “We don't want to dis-
mantle the State Department.

For the committee to retaliate

‘effectively, he said, it would need

the backong of a majority of the
Congress, which hasn’t been for-
thcoming in the past.

The Foreign Relations Commit-
tee isn't the onlv Senate panel
having trouble with administra-
tion officials.

Sen. William Proxmire. D.-
Wisc.. said three ranking mem-
bers of the Nixon administration
had agreed to appear before his
Joint Economic Committee last

‘month but failed to show up.

He identified them as Secre-
taries George Romney of Housing
and Urban Development and John
Volpe of Transportation and
Chairman Secor D. Browne of the

CAB Chairman Secor Browne,
Vice Chairman Whitney Gilli]-
land, and CAB member Robert
Timm are said to now be leaning
against youth fares. The feelings
of CAB members Robert Murphy
and G. Joseph Minetti are not
known.

“The CAB will bend to wliom-
ever makes the most noise.“
cording to Russell Lehrman. head
of Continental Marketing Corp.. a

concern.

In 1968. CAB reversed its own

sion that youth larcs were un-
justly discriminatory.

and Ralph

Now CAB is souring on youth
fares after receiving mail from
older travelers and legal pres-
sure from Continental Trailways
Bus System, which has lost riders
due to low air fares.

Two arguments are at the heart
of the anti—bargain-fare fight. One
is that the fares are unjustly dis-
criiniiiator_v against middle-aged

Club's ‘Broadway Style’
Nels Invitation To Georgia

cil. according to Dr. Phillip Cav-
anaugh. professor of Music and
director of the Glee Club. is an or-
ganization of all male glee clubs
in the country. Cavanaugh ex-
plained that the “invitation was
noteworthy." because Pitt is the

only club which is not from Geor-
gia that will be perforining at the
conference.

Cavanaugh explained that Pitt
was invited because “it is one of
very few clubs that do stage pro-
gramming with costumes and

lights, in the Broadway style.”
The director went on to explain
that the Pitt Glee Club will later
join with three Georgian clubs to
do some “more traditional sing-
mg.”

ac- A

passengers. The other is that the
price is too low in relation to
costs.

The NSL counters the first ar-
gument by pointing out that while
young and old standby travelers
are allowed to pay less. they also
have less money and risk not get-
ting a seat. An official report by
a Congressional air. fare expert
concurs. adding that one person
doesn't pay more just because an-
other person pays less.

“Besides,” says NSL’s Olson,
“a lot of middle-aged travelers
are business persons with travel
expense accounts which absorb
price increases, while students
who go to college far away will
come home less often if youth
fares are eliminated.”

NSL counters the second argu-
ment by pointing out that airlines

make healthy profits on youth

tares except when guaranteeing
reservations. Some airlines have
scheduled extra planes to handle
youth fare passengers while
others have openly offered I‘€S€‘.V-
ed seats at youth fare prices. Both
de facto and official guaranteed
reservation youth fares raise air-
line costs. To meet the objection
of abuse of reserved seat youth
fares. NSL favors elimination oi
these reserved seat discounts.
thus leaving only the true standby.

One sign of CAB‘s current mood
is its expected approval by Dec.
15 of a 25 per cent increase in
transatlantic youth fagres. If all
youth fares are ended. some tick-
ets will cost almost 400 per cent
more.

Letters to theEditor

Women ‘Exploited

Pitt News Editor
and Women of the
Uniyersity:

Once again the women of this /

University have been exploited.
This time by some of our own
number. A group of girls claim-
ing to be soldiers in the fight for
sexual equality called themselves

the "Pantherettes“ and set out to I

break the all—male tradition of the
Pitt Band (which incidentally
now marches several Pitt wo-
men). They appealed to the Pitt
Women to support their fight
and “give them a chance.”

Last evening at the Pitt-Rut-
gers gaméll got my first look at
our_ new monument to‘ Women's
equality‘ that has been a _year-
and-a-half in the making. They
need another year-and-a halt‘ prac-
tice. But more ‘appalling is
their lack of self-respect. Are the
women of this university and
this world to be merel_y show-

pieces in miniskirts- for skin-
seeking fraternity brothers‘? 2’
Another mediocre organization

has made its debut on the Pitt
campus. v This time the women
at Pitt have been directly involv-
ed andshamefully betrayed.
' Sincerely.

Shocking Flyer

The circulation of a flyer
throughout the University com-
crudely and cruelly
labeled "Ram Job," is profoundly
shocking to_..me——both in method
and intent. It purports to, discre-
dit the judgement and efforts
of a large and long standing com-

mittee in choosing a new Dean in '

The Graduate School of Educa-
tion. Devoid of any rationale, other
than the choice is not what some-

" one else had desired, it wouldseem '

that its origin arises from the
thwarted ambitions of someone
else for the sameiposition; There
is no question that its effect has
been to inflict personal hurt and
divisiveness on the department.
The document, with the "typical
attribute of this type of attack.

‘is unsigned. I would like to be-
lieve that the academic commun- ~

ity is above this sort of thing and

if the decision making process is
to be swayed by such a ploy then
my faith will be shaken in still
another institution.

Correction I

Dear Sir: ’

I write ‘to correct two mistakes
in the article by Mr. Baldys in
your issue of December 8 on the
topic of zero growth and the de-
bate between the Pittsburgh
Caucus of Labor Committees and

._\lt’.\'.\l'S. Hiller and Moore.

The Articlestates that Environ-
ment: Pittsburgh locked horns on
this issue at this debate with the
PCLC. This is not true. E:P was
not represented at the debate. and
took no part in setting it up. The
article refers to Marc Hiller as
Chairman of E:P. This is not true.
Hiller is not now and never‘ has
been Chairman of E:P.

The article goes on to say that
a Richard Rose characterizes
E:'P as an organ of power groups
controlling the working class. As
far as I know, Mr. Rose knows
nothing of our program. In any
case, the statement is nonsense,
and I can presume only that he
suffered from the same confusion

‘as your reporter Mr. Baldys in
believing that his debating op- ‘

ponents represented E : P.

But on the question: so far as;
I know, his group has made
only one public statement on zero
growth. In general terms. this
view is as follows. -

We take it as axiomatic that
economic growth (of which popu-
lation growth is one cause) will
eventually cease. It is therefore
silly to argue about whether or‘
not it should cease, since there
is nothing anyonecan do about
it. The only question is when.

We should therefore spend what‘-

little energy, intelligence and
insight we have in anticipating
the consequences of a steady-
state economy by doing at least

- three major things: redistributing

consumption of the .world’s re-
sources to avoidany intensifica-
tion of international rivalries; de-
vising a technology that will be
the basis for a steady-state econoi
my, i.e.v one that will provide for
the recycling of materials deriv-

ed from resources finite in amount
per unit time but infinite over
time; and, what both of these
depend on, disabusing ourselves
of the notion that bigger is bet-
ter. '
As Kenneth Boulding puts it
“the great phenomenon of the
twentieth century is closure."VBy
comparison with the effort ;\re-

'quired to prepare ourselves for
right-wing .

this. the left-wing
ideologically-inspired class-war-
fare analyses. with the forest of
slogans which has“ grown up
around them. pales into insignifi-
cance. -

I should be obliged if you
would print this clarification for
your readers.

Yours sincerely.
David L. Marshall. Coordinator

Death Ethic
Dear Sir:

I am writing in response to a
‘letter by Roger Johnson. that ap-
peared in the November 22nd
issue of the Pitt News. The letter

mentioned me by name. therefore
I would like to offer this reply.

' Mr. Johnson did not like the
pictures shown in_ the movie. "Re-
ality -of Abortion" at the Nov. 9
‘Pro Life Rally. because they
evoked an emotional response. He
suggests that the photographers
who took those pictures ought to
‘have also filmed the pictures of
what happens to a woman's in-
sides when a criminal abortionist
has completed his work. I believe
that pictures of torn uteri or
infected vaginal tracts would work
more in the pro life arguments
against abortion than for the death
‘ethic point of View Mr. Johnson
espouses. Why should we limit
ourselves to the handiwork of

the criminal‘ abortionists? Why '

not photograph also the bodies
of the two young_women who
died in Pittsburgh, Hospitals af-
ter so called legal abortions.
since the law has been declared
vague. (The source of this infor-
mation is Mrs. Judy Fink of the
Abortion Law‘Commission..)

As to Mr. Johnson's criticism
of my understanding of history
and the relationship of abortion
to the other Nazi atrocities. I
‘would inform him and your read-

that teaching a class of 600 is not much different than
’"a-class of 200 must cause one to wonder.

 Charles Ra-lph’s argument is that if a professor has
an army of teaching assistants to take care of laboratory
-sel,cltions,_ it makeslittle difference what his class size is.
 this is so, why can't a professor lecture to 2.000 stu-
dentsv? After all. he articulates the same words. Just
think of the faculty salaries saved. Or better yet. have
Vim make video tapes of his lectures and show them
'f;tof,10,000l students over a period of years. Would it not
 cheapest yet for_ this lecturer to prepare tapes and show
them to students in every university in the country. Just

-y_equalrf‘wisdoinK" and at_a very small fraction. ‘of the cost .

of our present system. The assumption is of course that
all a professor is responsible for is the verbal delivery
of "tr’uths.“ This system would work if all students were
the same and if all information were true facts. But of
course. this is not so. Students. faculty and information
vary along a broad spectrum.

A lecture is the point of view of one professor which

has to be blended with the experiences and background
of every individual student. When different professors
expound upon different points of view, the student can
integrate the various inputs into his education. The lec-

ture is not an end in itself‘but only a conceptual begin-_

ning. The development of this concept is dependent
upon an exchange of ideas—student to student and stu-
dent to professor. .-

How can a_ professor interact with 600 different
students‘? He can offer his point of view to them. but
how can they test their interpretation of this view with
him‘? Some of us resign ourself to the fact that we cant
reach each and every one of our students. but agree to
reach in a personal way. as many as we can. I feel no
army of teaching assistants can substitute for these per-
sonal confrontations. nor can the traditional 1. 2 or 3
office hourts). Obviously other faculty disagree with
the importance of the interaction of faculty with stu-
dents. I‘ for one believe that that is the reason I get
paid. A .

' I want also to explore another idea implied in Charles
Halplrs alternate viewpoint. This issue is that those
who publish "expose ignorance and preventtsi myth-
ology and witchery from dominating us“ and that some-
how teaching is opposed to this. Quality and mediocrity
can pervade any of ,mans activities and enlightenment

t "can be..'attained_ in y;m_any ways. Certainly the l‘c'riti,,cal7,_t _

   

    

Multiple Goals   Equal Quality  

analysis of information with students can be done with-

out the publishing of papers. The fact that a person
publishes is‘—no guarantee,.that the cause of enlighten-
ment is going to be served. There arepeople here at
Pitt who have published and advanced professionally.
who are dogmatists, and who believe and represent
knowledge»to be a compilation of truths.

I agree with Charles Ralph in that research is im-
portant in order for the frontier of our knowledge» to
continually advance. Each faculty member should search

for the manner in which he can participate in this goal. '

But we all are aware of the contemporary publishing
game. Academic advancement and personal glorification
and maybe enlightenment come from publishing papers.
A careful examination of journals often reveal‘ papers
published with little original content. These reflect more

gall than creativity.‘ But even with apparently meaty '

papers, there is no guarantee that what isexciting today

may not become the witchcraft of tomorrow. I wonder -

how Gregor Mendel would have fared in the tenure
system. He had many years of opportunity and only
published /one paper in Biology, and this was in an ob-
scurejournal!

It is the divergence of views and the multiplicity of
goals that will make a University vibrant. We should be
judging productivity by the quality of a person. not on

‘whether he fits into prejudged molds. This is-the basis
‘of the weakness in the recent tenuredecisions. I; for

one, am suspiciousof those. who claim. to be the "ulti‘-_

by JOHN METCALFE

The Pittsburgh Press is the most liberal after-
noon newspaer in this cit_y. Indeed. it can claim all
the superlatives for its class. for it stands alone.

If we rise ear_ly. or if we have no objection to
news which was old last midnight. there is an alter-
native paper. But if we wish to read newspapers on
Sunday. and cannot affort (or find) the Times, the
Press is our only choice.

Sundays, the Press seems almost benign and
humanistic in its editorials, for, on Sundays, a col-
umn by Lawrence Lee appears. Lee seems to oc-
cupy a position out of reach of even Spiro Agnew’s
right arm. He regularly mourns the passing of those
virtues he admires, and frequently excoriates those
who commit the sin of liberalism in any form.

To begin this new year of hope and peace/. he
gave us a litany of.all those who. for whatever‘rea-
son. have taken exception to any act of President
Nixon. "

‘After the predictable list of those we bomb
without declaring war. most of Congress. and cler-
gymen in general. Lee gives two amazing classes of
offenders. I will not paraphrase him: I will quote

him. Let no suggestion of tampering with context .

sully these pages.

“Academicians, sheltered and largely unpro-
ductive in their immaturity, revile him (Nixon)
while claiming for themselves special privileges to
raid the nation’s files. '

“Newsmen. melodramaticall_y seeking to create
a martyrdom where none exists. project a repres-

_ sion that. even if it existed. could not last more than
.four years.“

That should be enough. I trust you are as amaz-
ed and dismayed as I am. Lee appears to be edu-
cated: his English. while stilted. is good. In addi-
tion. he is undoubtedly paid by the Press for his con-
tributions: his concern for his fellow journalists
must be minimal. His view of the academic world——
he does not specify. faculty or student-—seems bi-
lious in the extreme.

As a student, as a journalist, and asva potential
instructor, I am offended.
, His last statement is especially intriguing. It
seems to imply that it is not unthinkable that Nixon
will indeed construct an era of represssion. how-

  . c.i......An.t. Half

ever. since Nixon is obliged to leave office in 1976. '

that repression cannot outlast him. Therefore. it
is unreasonable to criticize Nixon for throttling the
press.

There is another implication: that. so long as
academic freedom exists. there is a danger that
members of the academic community may-take
exception to the systemic erosion of the Constitu-
tion: further. that if nothing else proves effective.
they may attack the personalities and policies of the
administration

To Lee this is bad. His model of democracy
seems to be more modern Greece _than Classical
Greece. '

Lee never exposes his qualifications as an ex-
pert on political matters. In that. if in nothing else.
he resembles former Professor H. Bruce Frank-
lin. Franklin has been in the news lately as that
rarest of animals. a tenured professor who had been

fired. « . a

When I first heard of Franklin in l’.m.~ he was
chairman of something called the Marxist Study
Group. He was always introduced as Professor
Franklin from Stanford. _

In person he was a small defensive man who
always carried a copy of the issue of Ramparts
which included his picture. When he spoke, it was
always with total political commitment.

It was only later that I learned that H. Bruce
Franklin was an Assistant Professor of English.

While it is every humans privilege to express
his opinion. and to be as wrong as be possibly can}
I f'elt cheated.

I had thought that this shrill voice of the revol-
ution was somehow qualified, through special train-
ing, to support his curious opinions.

Similarly. Lee presents no credentials.

It has not been easy. but on this basis I have
come to an understanding of' his column. It is no

/ more to be taken seriously than my own column. th

one you are reading right now.

I have never claimed to have any basis for my
critical judgments, because I have _none.

‘Don’t trust anyone, not even me—especially
not the advice I just gave you.

w Most likely I'm just as wrong as Mr. Lee. I only
hope my mistakes are better put.

ers that the strict Nazi anti abor-
tion law came into being on May
9th, 1943, four months after the
Battle of Stalingrad, when the
Germans were becoming particu-
larl_y sensitive about their.declin-
ing birthrate after 18 years of
abortion. The Nazi prohibition
on abortion applied only to Ar_y—
an Germans and specifically
exempted -Jews. In fact Jewish
women were forcibly aborted

"at Buchenwald and other concen-

tration camps after the law was
passed. (The source for this

Finally. Mr. Johnson indicated
that in his own thinking there re-
ally is a connection between abor-
tion and other anti life threats.
when he says that "if I were
suffering from a terminal illness
and were being kept alive only
by needles. tubes and bottles. I
would much-rather be left to
die in peace.

Again Mr. Johnson does not

understand. The Florida Death

ingl_y enough brought applause
from the audience.

Packinpah utilizes many tech- ‘

niques we have seen before in his
films. such as violence a la slow
motion. He includes an unusual.
almost slow motion sequence at a
lake with McQueen and Ali Mac-
Graw. We also see Peckinpah‘s
women, one who must be domin-
ated. portrayed by Miss Struthers.
and one who must be placed on a
pedestal. MacGraw. who prob-
ably would be more at home on an
Oscar De Laurente pedestal as
opposed to Peckinpahs. Last but

_ not least is the Peckinpah hero:

strong. forceful. moral. and gen-
erally male. Steve McQueen is all
of these to Peckinpah. and this is
why the reunion of the two’ after
Junior Bonner was almost ex-

I pected.

McQueen portrays what socie-
ty would label a bad guy, ex-con,
thief, etc. But soon Peckinpah
has us rooting for him to sue-
ceed. We don’t want him to get
caught by the cops. In fact, in Mc-
Queen’s encounter with the police,
you could sense the tension as Mc-
Queen was about to be caught and
the sigh of relief when -McQueen

every acting rolef but often enough to give that impression." The most
recent was the 1972 Tony Award which proclaimed her Best Actress of

for her characterizations in Twigs.

V The first of her important awards was an Obie, the off-Broadway
theatre trophy, for her performance in Tartuffe. Performances in The
River Line and The Misanthrope earned her the Vernon Rice Drama

ststnbetg  with  
Mendelssohn Mania

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Programs devoted to the work of a single composer tend to be
unsatisfactory and this weekend’s all-Mendelssohn program given by
our local orchestra brought nothing but artistic dissatisfaction to this
listener. While the delicate. refined tones of Mendelssohn’s music are
pleasant enough. one would hope for smaller doses of this composer's
music: four Bartholdv works on one program are at least two too
many.

Opening with the Overture to Ruy Blas (not to be confused with
Steve Blassi. certainlva “throw away” work of very negligible pro-
portions (at least half of the audience must have thought it quite negli-
gible as they were standing in the foyer. fulfilling the very fashionable
role of latecomers); things quickly moved along to the G minor con-
certo for piano with David Bar-Illan at the pianoforte.

Bar-Illan proved himself more than competent at the keyboard,
in fact, his performance proved to be the highlight of otherwise un-
imaginative evening. In command throughout, Bar Illan was most un-
obtrusive and was most helpful in keeping things running smoothly-—
the music flowed and a constant dialogue between soloist and orches-
tra was readily apparent.

Things fared much less successfully’ in the other concerto of the
evening. -the ever popular e minor Violin Concerto. Itzhak Perlman.
certainly no. stranger to Pittsburgh audiences. was in anything but top
form and the concerto proved to be only a very faint specter of its
familiar beauty. ' . _

Problems in intonation. especially in the andante. cast a dismal
shadow over the compositions merits. Even the virtuosic fireworks of
the finale were stifled by problems in technique and intonation. This
must come as a surprise. especia-lly in light of Perlman’s past perform-
ances here lTl'Pll’.tSl)l.lI‘2l1. Evidently a bad‘ night for the artist involved.

Despite the- general dullness of the evening, we have yet to men-

__.‘,tion the chief culprit, conductor William Steinberg. Returning af_ter a
" " long bout with -illness, Steinberg was looking"anything but good and his

ineptness on the podium was very reminiscent of his work with the or-
chestra-in recent months. While we realize Steinberg’s taxing schedule
and his recurring health problems, we also realize that hiswork in the
concert hall has been on the decline.

This was readily evident throughout the-Italian Symphonypthe

work which closed the program. Tempi very often lagged and mu.ch of .

the Mediterranean sunniness of the work seemed to be lost in the
eclipse of energy onthe conductor’s part. Steinberg may have returned

- too soon to the podium following his most recent illness. ' ,

It seems like the Bee Gees have
been recording for years and
years. probably because despite
all the changes in musical tastes.
they're still writing the same sort
of songs and working to the same
formula.

But there new one, To Whom It
May Concern (Atco), does re-
flect some subtle differences —
more mature, more melodic than
earlier works. Maybe the orches-

the boys are maturing, but it does
make for a nice album.

“Sea of Slmiling Faces” is a nice

Team, Now   .4-7

Associate Sports Editor
The Christmas holidays have not been very merry for the Pitt
Panther basketball squad and things. have not gotten any brighter
since the beginning of the new schoolterm. .

Last Saturday at Syracuse the Orangemen knockedoff the Pan-
ther cagers by the score of 74-66. This was the Cats‘ seventh loss
(five of them during the vacation) against four wins, ' I

In previous games the Panthers’ inability to shoot consistently

‘has been their major problem but ‘ ' ’ I

in the contest against Syracuse _ I ' ‘ '
it was plain old sloppy ball hand- , The  Ne‘VS
  Sports

_ling that proved" to be theigreater
contributor to their downfall. ‘

Both squads combined for a total
of 70 turnovers and the.Panthers
somehow’ managed to cop 39 of
them. Several of these turnovers-

,f,eflation of promising Pitt comebacks in the game.

1 With seven minutes gone in the start of the.eontest Syracuse
slapped Pitt with a 11-2 lead and by ‘the end of the first half the
Orangemen were running away from the Cats by the score of 40-29.

The Orangemen‘s two top scorersduring the game. Mike Lee (27
points) and Bob Dooms (14 points) helped their team to contain the
Pitttsquad earlyin the second half. Syracuse handily controlled the
Panthers until the Cats started a full-court press with 13:12 remaining -'
in the game. ’ '

Within the next few minutes; the,_‘Panthers substantially slashed
the Orange lead of156-41 to a closei56‘-53. Pitt's Billy Knight, the high

/ scorer of the evening with 28 points, nipped one more point off of

Syracuse’s three point lead.

The Panthers. however. could not sustain the drive and once more
turned the game back‘ into the hands of the Orangemen. who went
on towin their ninth game against two-loses. .

"Ourrally just fell short. that‘s all.“ was the way Pitt's head
basketball coach ‘Buzz Ridl‘ explained the Panthers sloppy defeat.

- “We lost a‘ couple of key baskets on turnover calls."

What started the Panthers on their chain of losses over the holi-

' days was the not too successful ‘72 Steel Bowl Tournament at the

Civic Arena. It was certainly not the time for Pitt to get its revenge
against the Duquesne Dukes who ended up the Steel Bowl "Champs
for defeating them in the ‘71 tourney.

In the first round __of‘the Steel Bowl the Dukes defensed their
way to a 67-61 victory over the Panthers. Neither of the teams‘ of-
fensive superstars made a real difference shooting wise in the game.

Pitt's Knight was held to only four’. points in the first half and
ended the game with »a total of 12 points. The Dukes‘ Lionel “Big
Train“ Billingy was only able to collect a meager 14 points but more

importantly he made the decisive moves on defense. ‘coming up -

with 19 rebounds in the game.

Both squads were off in their field’ goal shooting with the Dukes_
only hitting for 47.3 per cent and the Panthers for an ever lower 32.9

 cent. The determining factor for the outcome of the game seemed
to be the defenses of the teams rather than their shooting ability.‘

"Our defense was the difference." Duquesne‘s coach basketball
Bed Manninglapply explained.

In the consolation game of the Steel Bowlthe Panthers squeezed

. by Southern Illinois by the score of 65-63 while the Dukes came from

behind to capture their 12th tourney title in
mg Jacksonville 82-73.. _
Jacksonville led at the end of the first half by the score of 40-34

but again with,Billingy’s_ assistance (he collected 24 points and 18 re-
bounds) the Dukes went on to victory. I .

The Panthers only went on to meet Wittenberg a week later and
to collect another loss. The Cats were downed by Wittenberg. 63-54

Knight was again in a slump as he wasxonly able to score eight
points. A-nice surprise was given to the Panthers in this game. how-

Holiday Pitt “Blows

by BILL PROUDFOOT

Outside the temperature was
near-.»\rctic. and its a long walk
up the hill. and it was Saturday
night. and. well. ma_ybe people

"had something else to do than

watch a college wrestling match.

But the sparse crowd that dot-
ted the confines of‘ Fitzgerald
Field House saw a "doozy“ as
Pitt's grapplers had an upset win
snipped from them. 19-15. by
perennial dreadnaught .\'avy.,

The meet wasn't decided until
the final period of the last match.
when Pitt‘s heavyweight. Carl
fioba. was taken down twice and
beaten by Larry Loerch.

The finish had the crowd wring-
ing their scarves and screaming
themselves tonsil-less. In fact,
Pitt’s head coach and leading
cheerleader Dave Adams turned

alternating shades" of pink and \

crimson yelling himself hoarse
as his Panthers were on the verge

of an upset going into the final
three matches. '   

"We were very disappointed we
didn't win." he rasped in a barely
audible voice. "We wrestled our
hearts out. but we didn't win.“

Part of Adams‘
ment in losing. what surely would
have been a fine upset. was the
lack of student support. "If we‘d
ftave had a good student turnout
1 think we could have turned it
around. Having a big crowd
cheering for you really makes a
difference for these kids. "

The meet itself was one of those
old fashioned nailbiting cliffhang-
ers. Combined with a successful"
debut by John “Bimbo” Chat-
man, Pittgot some heroics from
unlooked for quarters as sopho-

dissappoint-l

more Bob Beck knocked off last
years runnerup in the Eastern re-
gionals, Fred Hahndorf.

And to cap off what was to be‘

the Cats‘ last winning bout. 167
pottnder Hay Dallatore w'as cfiok-
ed into blue—f'aced unconscious-
ness and survived the kayo tp nip
.\'avy‘s Bob Hartman. -1-3. The
match was Halted until the stiff"-
ened Dallatore could continue.

- But the meet was eventually de-

cided in the 177. 190. and heavy-
weight classes. A win in any one
would have given the Panthers an
18-16 upset. but Jim Cara-
mana. Craig Tritch. and. finally.
Hoba all were decisioned. “I felt
that we were going to win one of
those last three matches. but we
didn‘t.“ croaked Adams.

The meet started well for Pitt
as 118 pound George “Fuddy”
Bryant spent most of three per-
iods grinding Lance Leonhardt’s
stumpy nose into the mat.

Navy got that one back and then
some in the 126 pound class. as
Ken Berger pinned Dave De.\la—
rino. who was subbing for in-

vjured Bob Bailey. in the second

period.

The 134 pound match got the
crowd up as Buzzy Beck whipped
last years NCAA l:lastern runner-
up. Fred Hahndorf. 6-4. Beck
amazed everyone. including Hahn-
dorf. maintaining constant pres-
sure until the red headed Midship-
man sagged. mouth gaping. out of
gas. '

In his first start for Pitt, 142
pounder Ron Selfridge was shut
out by former two-time Pennsyl-
vanina_ high school champ, Dan
Muthler, 10-0. Team score was
10-6.

I

Pitt came on in the middle
weights. though. and swept the
150. 158. and 167 pound classes.
as Buzzato. Chatman. and Dalla-
torc won decisions.

Chatman was making his first

Streak

by YAIER LEHRER
The Pitt swim team defeated previously‘ undefeated Temple team

64-49 at "the Trees Hall pool on Dec. 9 to avenge last years 63-50 loss --

to the Owls at\Temple;

The Pitt team was yery impressive in their win with four freshman
records being set and two new team records being established.

John Templin set a freshman and team record with a 2:19 ill the
200-yard breaststroke. Mark Winters and Dave Natvali both broke the
freshman record in the 1000-yard freestyle.

Winters did an outstanding job by winning both distance swimming
events while George Hawes won the 100-yard, freestyle. Hawes was
awarded third place while second went to Temple and first went to

Mark Wallace, in the 50.

Although he did not set a record in the event. Dave Natali put’ in a
fine showing in the 200—yard.butterf"ly with the next swimmer being a

full four seconds behind him.

,1

The divers continued to be impressive. with Jeff Millet‘ taking first A
and third places while Jack Garro took a second and a third.

While the student body was away for the vacation, the divers went
to the International Hall of Fame East-West meet .in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. Jack Garrow finished fourth out of a field of 57 divers in the three-
meter event, while Jeff Miller finished sixth amongf54 divers in the
three-meter event, while Jeff Miller finished sixth amo,ngv54 divers in

the one-meter event.

_ Diving Coach Al Coffe_v called this outstanding and said the the
finishes by both swimmers were much stronger-than he anticipated.

The Pitt, diving team welcomed a new member this week by the ..
name ‘of Hector Bass. Hector is a fine diver and represented Puerto
Rico in the 1972 Summer Olympics and when the matter of his eligibil-
tty is cleared up. he will presumably be a valuable member of the team.

Neiger's Tigers Debut

by LYNN HARRIS
On Jan. 9 the Pitt gymnastic
team will open its season against
Cornell University. ’

Cornell. a member of the Ivy
Leaguei was voted in" this year
along with Southern Connecticut
State College to the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Gvmnastic League.
Other members of the EIGL are
Army. Navy. Penn State. Spring-
field College. University of Mass-
achusetts. Temple. Svracuse. and
Pitt.

The EIGL contains the "best
competition in the East." accord-
ing to head coach Warren Neiger.
who is in his 20th year of coach-
ing at the University.

While Penn State has been the
top team in the past several years
it will be strongly tested by Cor-
nell who is at the top of the Ivy
League teams.

Pitt has, six seniors returning
this season. Dick Pribis. an out-
standing ‘senior. will compete in
the floor exercise. vaulting. high
bar. and parallel bars. Chris
Gardner will compete in floor ex-
ercises: Bob Rogers. vaulting:
Dan Campell. parallel bars. high
bar. and vaulting: Elliot Sanft.
parallel bar; and Lee Lilly. pom-
mel horse.

Juniors Ed Swerdlow and Carl
Bell will compete in vaulting.
floor exercise. and pommel horse.
respectively. John Hornick and
Cliff Custer. both sophomores.
will tackle the rings. Gary Wolfe.
a freshman from Norristown. will
compete in the pommel horse.
Wolfe who injured his leg earlier
in the season is now back in shape
and will compete against Cornell.

Tom Cardamone, a senior, who
was seriously injured earlier in
the season, will be missed by the
team. Mark Boyett, a sophomore,
who competes in floor exercises is
out with an ankle injury. ’

While Cornell is favored over
Pitt. anything can happen. Cornell
has already played Army and beat
them. 152.0-143.1.

Cornell is coached by Bob Mar-

tin. The captains of Cornell are
Mike Lawitts who is strong on
rings and Chuck Seabury. Dave
Van Dyke and Brian Dawson are
the outstanding all-around per-
formers for Cornell. On the paral-
lel bars is Wes Henscom who
scored 9.1 against Army.

Even half time will be exciting
with Cheryl Diamon of McKees-
port, a recent second place winner
in the Midwest Open Gymnastics
Championship, performing on the
floor exercise and uneven bars.-~\.

One detriment to Pitt is their

lack of depth. They could field 15

BOB ROGERS, a senior member of the‘ Pitt gymnastic team, works out on k _

"This" will hurt us against Cor-
nell onTuesdav and Navy later ‘in
the season.“ commented Neiger.

While the team has not had a
good season in many years their
schedule is _tough and does not
change much from year to year.

Practice for Neiger‘s tigers
starts early in September. At the
beginning of the season individual
skill work is done. As the season
progresses more combination
work is done.
