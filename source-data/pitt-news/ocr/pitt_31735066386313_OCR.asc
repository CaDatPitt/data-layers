After more tl1an 23 years of serving on
Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s
administrative team, Executive Vice
President Jack Freeman is leaving the
University of Pittsburgh for a top position
at Temple University.

“Jack Freeman is going to leave the
university, probably tomorrow," Posvar
told a meeting of the university senate
council yesterday.

Freeman will serve as executive vice
president and chief operating ofﬁcer at
Temple University. Officials at Temple
were unavailable for comment.

“I feel very sentimental about this, but I
also feel good about it because this is

 
 
       

another experience in his career,” Posvar
said.

Posvar and Freeman worked closely
together at the Air Force Academy before
Posvar began serving as Pitt’s chancellor
in 1967. Posvar recruited Freeman to be
his executive assistant less than a week
after Posvar began his tenure at Pitt.
Freeman also served as president of the
Johnstown campus. He has been the
executive vice president since 1979.

Freeman left Pitt once before in 1986 for
a job as chancellor of the University of
Maine system. Freeman returned to Pitt
just two weeks later, citing financial
problems at Maine as the reason he could
not continue there.

Yesterday Posvar said that he would not
seek a replacement for Freeman’s position.

“As far as taking care of the situation on
this end, we are going to eliminate his
[position] as I had contemplated doing
when Jack took his brief trip to Maine,”
Posvar said.

Posvar added that various people will be
taking over facets of Freeman's job.

“His primary successor will be John
Yeager, vice president for administration,
who will retain that title and also incorporate
the responsibility of facilities management
and computer and information sciences.
The other management areas will be under
my supervision exclusively for the
remainder of my tenure," Posvar said.

Posvar will supervise the offices of
athletics, student affairs, finance and
treasury and the university counsel.

Although human civilization
has been destroying the earth for
centuries, with cooperation and
effort the damage can be repaired,
according to environmentalist
Allen Bard Schmooker.

“We've got to change the world.
Fortunately the awareness that
we’ve .got to change it is
spreading,” Schmooker said.

Schmooker, the author of
Sowings and Reaping: and Outof

Weakness, gave a lecture on
Wednesday that was sponsored

Environmentalist calls for cooperative eﬁ”ort to repair Earth

by Concerned Leaders for
Environmental Action Now.

Schmooker said that hurnanity’s
destruction of nature is, for him,
the most tragic sight.

“For some people it’s the sight
of a malnourished child; for me
it’s the sight of the burning of the
Amazon, or the cutting of the old-
growth forests or the dead body
of an elephant with its tusks
removed,” he said.

The Fertile Crescent, arable land
famied by the Mesopotamians
beginning in 5000 B.C. but now a
vast desert, was an example cited

U.S. actions in Gulf condemned

By Debbie Lincoln
For T be Pitt News

The faculty council of the
Schoolof Education has passed a
resolution condemning U.S.
policy and handling of the Kuwait
oil crisis.

The resolution, passed Sept.
21, called for the immediate
withdrawal of American military
troops in and around Saudi
Arabia.

The resolution said that the
current American position has
unnecessarily placed the world
on the verge of a war and
endangered the lives of thousands
of people. It also pointed out that
the money being spent to keep a
military presence in the Middle
East is coming at the expense of
important domestic programs.

“Resources that are being
earmarked for the Middle East
might very well be more
appropriately used for education
and other social needs,” said
faculty chairperson David
Crossman.

The resolution concludes by
calling for a diplomatic solution
to be sought and the development
of ene rgy policies directed toward
making America self-sufficient.

continuous destruction of the
earth. '

“[It’s] just like time-lapse
photography where an acorn
turns into an oak tree before your
eyes; here the oak tree turns into
a wasteland,” Schmooker said.

Schmooker speculated on why
civilization became destructive.

“The problem originates when
a creative animal, like a human
being, starts to devise a new way
of living. By changing its
relationship with the ecosystem,
it starts to become dangerous to
the earth,‘ Schmooker said.

"[Human beings], by virtue of

Although he said it israre for a
department to come up with a
public position on a political issue,
Crossman said, “I am very anxious
that the council take action, that
it be responsible, take leadership
and be receptive to our faculty
and our students.”

Many faculty members within
the School of Education have
expressed reservations about
whether such a resolution is
appropriate. Many of those who
object feel that the council, which
is the governing body for the
School of Education, should
conﬁne itself to the affairs of the

school.
But Crossman believes that this
issue shows a level of

responsibility and concern that
the council has not undertaken
before.

Steven Lyon, an associate
professor of special education at
Pitt and the author of the
resolution, is also on the faculty
council. He said he first began to
disagree with American policy in
the Middle East when he
recognized the parallels between
the Kuwaiti and the Vietnam
crises. It was then that he decided
that the manner of U.S.
involvement was probably

world. One of the problems of
living in an ecological niche is
that there are limits,” he said.

The destruction of the rain
forests and old-growth forests
and the rapid extinction rate of
plants and animals are among
humanity's many contributing
factors to the earth's failing health,
said Schmooker.

American interest in
environmental concerns
ﬂuctuates depending on the
current political situation,
according to Schmooker.

"The environment was a big

incorrect.

Lyon believes that the solution
to the crisis can be found
peacefully, but that President
George Bush has actually done
things that have hampered finding
a peaceful solution.

“I don’t think diplomatic efforts
were exhausted,” said Lyon.

Lyon feels that there is no
outcome scenario that could arise
that would favor U.S. interests.

“I’m not convinced that
conventional warfare will
produce an acceptable outcome.”
he said.

Lyon is also worried that due to
U.S. commitment, conventional
warfare may escalate to include
the use of chemical weapons.

In addition to potential warfare,
Lyon is concerned about the
amount of money that the United
States is spending on troops at a
time when the economy is in a
declining state. Lyon argues that
the money could instead be used
to fight the crisis we are facing in
education on the domestic front.

The School of Education is
hosting a symposium for both
faculty and students Nov. 7 to
discuss further the American
presence in the Middle East and
its effects on domestic issues.

disappeared until the new global
order of the 19905, when we
stopped thinking that the United
States and the Soviet Union were
going to annihilate each other,
and we started thinking about
acid rain and global warming,”
he said.

Schmooker hopes that the
human race will make every effort
to restore the health of the earth.

“If I had one wish to make for
myself, I’d like to live long enough
to see the world moving back
toward good health," Schmooker
said.

THE PI’I’I' NEWS, Tuesday, October 9, 1990

 

Coping on Campus...

Intense emotional response typical of assault Victims

but frequently this is followed by
feelings of anxiety, helplessness,
depression and extreme vul-
nerability. The assault

Violent assaults against students
are on the increase on college
campuses. When a particularly
nasty assault occurs, we all feel a
twinge of fear, but since it is not
a pleasant thing to think about,
we tend to quickly repress the
realities of the danger around us.
The evidence, however, suggests
that during our lifetimes most of
us will experience a-n assault,
either against us or against a
close friend or relative. Women
are particularly vulnerable, and it
is estimated that at least one
woman in five will be sexually
assaulted at one time in her life.

The most immediate response
to assault is shock. A kind of
psychological numbness seems
to occur, which probably is the
mind’s initial way of coping with
trauma. Usually, as the numbness
fades and the reality of what has
happened sinks in, the victim
will begin to experience a variety
of intense emotional responses.
Anger may take over for awhile,

often

Dr. Robert Gallagher

damages the victim’s self-
concept, leaving the person
feeling inadequate, frightened
and less in control of his or her
life.

These intense reactions may

last anywhere from a few weeks
to several months, depending on
the severity of the assault and the
psychological makeup of the
victim. Sometimes, however, the
symptoms may persist for an
unusually long period of time.
They may also re-appear later,
near the anniversary date of the
assault or because something else
in the person’s life triggers the
emotional reaction. Nightmares
may recur; con—centration may
be affected, and a kind of
hypervigilance or generalized
anxiety may become
pronounced.
Unfortunately many assault
victims do not like to talk about
their experiences. Sometimes, as
is the case with many rape victims,
unwarranted feelings of shame
are experienced, and the
victimization is suffered in silence.
Family and friends, with no
understanding of what is causing
the moodiness or withdrawal of
the victim, may not be very

supportive, which further
exacerbates the problem.

Survivors of assault should not
underestimate the psychological
implications of their experience.
It is important for them to share
their experience with trusted
friends and utilize whatever
healing support they can provide.
If the trauma is severe or the
symptoms long—lasting, pro-
fessional help should be sought.
Counseling, even of a short—term
nature, can help survivors to
recover their lost self-esteem, to
focus on their natural coping
mechanisms and to re-establish
feelings of control in their lives.

If you know someone who is
experiencing continued distress
following an assault, you might
suggest that he or she call the

S/oepara’ missing the point...

On Oct. 1 an editorial in The PittlNews accused Student
Government Board President Julie Shepard of using self-
serving methods in choosing the student representative
for the presidential search committee. Shepard’s quotes in
yesterday’s,Carnegie Mellon University’s The Tartan make
the situation even more disturbing as she showed that she
still has not realized the problem with her appointment
process. —

Shepard said, “If you put someone who has a very
focused agenda on something like this, I don’t think they
will necessarily take all interests besides their own into
account. Most Pitt students happen to be white and
heterosexual. That doesn’t mean we should discount
minority groups, but it means we should pick someone
open to all concerns.”

Unfortunately, Shepard refuses to see that it is her error
in her selection process that is at fault, not the selection
itself. By choosing an SGB member without opening the
position up to others on the campus, she cannot be sure
that she has gotten the best person for the job.

It's interesting that Shepard is so, defensive about
minorities not being involved, considering that her
“selection process” was from a minority of students: that
being the small percentage of students at the SGB office.

losing’ a vice president?

As Dr. Wesley Posvar prepares to leave the university,
many of the people associated with him at the university
are planning their departures as well.

Dr. Jack Freeman, the executive vice president of Pitt,
has accepted a job at Temple University as executive vice
president and chief operating officer. He will begin his
new job immediately.

Freeman has served under Posvar since Posvar took
over as president of Pitt. He came here as Posvar’s
executive assistant. He later served as president of the
University of Pittsburgh atjohnstown. Upon his return to
the main campus, he was given the job of executive vice
president, a position created solely for him.

However, when Freeman leaves, his position will be
terminated. Posvar determined that he would take care of
academic situations which arose. john Yeager, currently
vice president of administration, will retain his position
and also take over facilities management.

If Posvar can eliminate a job title in that little amount of
time, it leads us to believe that Freeman's job was
unnecessary and that his services could have been used
elsewhere.

Furthermore, if this is true, then this means that the
University of Pittsburgh has wasted over $100,000 a year
for the past 11 years.

 

The deadline to register to vote
in the Nov. 8, 1990 election was
Oct 8, 1990. I wonder how many
unregistered voters will take
advantage of this right.

I ﬁnd it hard to believe that in
a country as wonderful as ours,
we have so many apathetic
people. Apathy comes in a variety
of forms, but the one form of
apathy that irritates me the most
is people who are apathetic
toward the right to vote. I ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to understand why so
many people in our country do
not exercise their right to vote.

If there is one thing that bothers
me more than anything, it is
people that complain about our
government and then do nothing
to change it. One of the easiest
ways to change the government
only takes about ﬁve minutes. (I
timed it!) All any citizen has to do
is vote.

A lot of people feel that their
votes don’t count. This is such a
falsehood. Take for instance what
happened in the Republican
primary in May of 1990. The
hand-picked Republican
candidate Barbara Hafer almost
didn't receive the Republican
nomination for governor. Peg
Luksik, a homemaker from
Johnstown, walked away with 42
percent of the Pennsylvania
Republican vote. Luksik’s bid for
governor sent a powerful message
to the Republican Party.
Pennsylvania's conservative
Republicans voiced their
disapproval with Barbara Hafer
with a single action — their vote.

In Allegheny County there are

Voters need to exercise rights

745,313 registered voters. In the
May primary only 230,532 voters
went to the polls. Where were
the other 514 ,,781 people on
election day? Ifthey couldn't make
it to the polls, at least they could
have used an absentee ballot So
many people use the excuse that
politics have become very
unexciting. Well, maybe if our U.
S. citizens would get involved in
the electoral process, they would
ﬁnd the electoral process exciting.
Even if the voters are dissatisﬁed

Jacinta
Dvorak

with the candidates that are
running for ofﬁoe, they can always
exercise their right to cast a write-
in vote.

I am not preaching to people
about which way they should
vote or which party to register
with. The fact of the matter is that
in the United States, people that
vote regularly are becoming a
minority. In the near future, this
voting minority will be making
the majority's decisions for the
rest of the United States. V

It shocks me that so many Pitt
students are so apathetic toward
the whole political process. Don't
these students realize that there
is pending legislation to cut
student loans and to tax
scholarships? I don’t know about
you, but I think that these issues

are ones worth casting a vote
against.

The local media makes it so
easy for the voter to get
information on candidates. Ifyou
pick up any Pittsburgh paper,
there is information on which
issues each candidate has taken a
stand on. It takes only a few
minutes to skim these election
pages. It only takes a few minutes
to be an informed voter. I

In parts of Eastern Europe free
voting was held this summer for
the first time in years. In some

are turning our back on a

constitutional right that our
forefathers died to preserve.

If you aren’t registered to vote,
doso soon. If you aren’t registered
to vote at Pitt, get your parents to
send you an absentee ballot. It is
so simple and takes such a short
amount of time.

One of my good friends is
politically apathetic. I tell him
that if it were up to me, I would
make an amendment to the
Constitution that states if anyone
doesn’t vote in three ‘consecutive
elections, s/he loses the right to
vote. My friend just looks at me
and laughs. He tells me that I am
too politically involved. But if his
right to vote was suddenly taken
away, I don’t think that he would
be laughing too much longer.

Vegetarianism good for animals

In rebuttal to Alec Walen’s
statement that animals only sense
the present and not the future, I
cannot fathom how he uses this
as a reason to be a carnivore. This
does not justify one to say that
since man can see into the future
well then man is dominant over
those who cannot.

Isle is also blatantly overlooking

the harsh realities of cosmetic
testing, factory farming and other
cruel abuses of the right of

Letters

animals. It is a proven fact that
animals feel pain, experience

elation and learn how to trust.
Considering these facts, doesn’t
it sound a bit inane to say that
one is not a vegetarian because
animals only have a sense of the
present and it is therefore all
right to eat them?

It appears that the Lady Panthers volleyball team has
taken over the football team’s “Raise the Level” slogan
this year —— only they've done it quite successfully. The
volleyball team won the Georgia Tournament last
weekend.

“The last two weeks, we’ve really raised our level of

‘- play,” said head coach Sue Woodstra of the Lady

Panther volleyball team after it shut out host Georgia
and Duke in the championship game to win the title.

Woodstra said of the championship match, “We
really controlled the match. It was a good one for us.”
Jenelle Lantagne was named the toumament’s Most
Valuable Player, and Susan Zonneville made the all-

’ tournament team.

Pitt now enters what Woodstra called “a good part of
our schedule” with a record of 14-2.

The team entered the Georgia Tournament ranked

;. — 17th in the country and could possibly move up this

week after their victories. Eleven of the team's next 13
games are at home.

“It’s been tough on the girls being away so much the
last two weeks, and to add to it, everyone has had a
cold, or has one now, during the past few weeks,”

Serums, /900/eers and bucks: Pitt Rugby Club reorgunizes

, Jason Hillrnan/The Pitt News
‘ Heather Hollands and her Lady Panther teammates have gotten oﬂ’ to a 14-2 start and a top-201-anking this year.

By Ryan Buncher
stag“ Writer

Woodstra said. “We aren’t having practice [Monday] to
give the girls a chance to catch up.”

When asked what has improved about the team in
recent weeks, Woodstra said, “The intensity has been
there all season, but now the concentration is there all
the time. That's what has really helped.”

She also stressed the team's ability to adapt to game
situations. “We can adjust to what the other team is
doing to us prior to the match and during the match. It
is everyone doing this, not just a few players, as can
often be the case.”

The team will have to adjust to playing without one
of its best players however, because Ann Marie Lucanie
suffered a sprained ankle in the last game of the Duke
match. Lucanie will miss Wednesday’s game against
West Virginia at Fitzgerald Field House and Woodstra
is not sure when the first—year student will return.

“I was pleased with the way everybody adjusted
[when Lucanie got hurt] because I almost never take
Ann Marie out,” Woodstra said. That leaves the team
with only seven players because Bridget Gary is still
day-to-day with a sprained knee.

After the West Virginia match the team has two Big
East matches on the road: Villanova on Friday and
Georgetown on Saturday. On Sunday 10th-ranked
Penn State comes to Fitzgerald Field House.

‘By Monica Novak
For T be Pitt News

What has eight forwards, seven
backs, a scrum, a scrum—half, a
hooker and 30 feet?

Give up? Pitt’s new rugby club
team.

Still in its recruiting stages, the
team held its first practice on the
Cathedral of Learning lawn
recently.

Some players gathered in an
arm—linked huddle, or scrum,
while the scrum-half put the
miniature, blimp—shaped ball into
play. And as the hooker practiced
controlling the ball with his feet,
other players worked on passing

A, the ball backwards in a swooping

motion. With a few intermittent
raindrops and a slight moisture
hanging in the air, the Gothic
Heinz Chapel and the Cathedral
provided a perfect setting for this
rugged sport that originated at
Rugby College in England during
the 18005.

A running, hitting and passing
game, rugby is often associated
with action and violence -
“elegant violence,” as one player
suggests.

Many people view it as a rough
and barbaric sport that attracts
rowdy players as well as rowdy
fans.

Disputing this misconception
and defending his passion, Mike
Ilaas, a player and one of the

organizers for the Pitt club,
contests that rugby is a game of
“action and finesse, even though
it may look like chaos on the
field.”

“It is a thinking game that
requires ruggedness and overall
strength. I always tell people this:
It doesn’t matter how hard you
can hit; what matters is how hard
you can gethit and still get up and
run with the ball,” Haas said.

The idea to re-establish a team
began last spring with Pitt
students, Rick Kauffman and
Doug Palmer as key initiators.
Team manager Lori Robles said,
“I knew there was an interest in
rugby here at Pitt just from talking
with friends.” An adamant rugby

fan herself, Robles aided in the
effort to start a team.

Now an official club, the team
is anxious to get the ball rolling.
It has scheduled games against
Carnegie Mellon University, Pitt-
Johnstown and Slippery Rock,
and is also considering playing
local Pittsburgh men's teams.
They are currently searching for
a home field of natural grass and
sponsors to fund uniforms,
equipment, and referees.

The team is also anxious to
shed the “bad boy" image so
often associated with rugby
players. Thanks to a rowdy bunch
of boys that got into trouble after
a game, Pitt has been without a
rugby team for 15 years. Pitt’s

new rugby team is paying the
price. Right now it is temporarily
on probation.

Enthusiastic about the new
team, Haas is confident that it will
prove competitive.

Haas, a Pitt graduate student
who has been playing nigby since
his freshman year of college, was
very impressed with the turnout
of the first practice. “Seventy
percent of the people who
showed up had played before,”
said Haas. “As far as a first practice
goes, this was the best] had ever
seen.”

“Rugby is 70 percent social, 30
percent competitive. I don’t know
a better way to spend a Saturday,”
said Haas.

opposed to six players on a side
in NCAA competition.

“I think that’s something that
really helped me; it would help
any player. You have to do
everything,” Lantagne said. “It
makes you a well—rounded player
because you must hit, spike, set,
play defense  you do it all.
Indoor play is more specialized.”

As far as continuing to play on
the beach after graduating,
Lantagne sees herself there, but
the Olympics are not a goal for
her.

“It's a big step from college. I
think I have it mentally but not
physically,” Lantagne said. She
sees her height — 5-feet 7-inches
— as a big disadvantage for larger
competitions.

The team hasn’t had an easy
schedule so far, and it is holding
at 14-2. “The toughest teams are

behind us,” Lantagne said. “All
we can do is keep going up.”
Entering this season, the co-
captain was a little worried about
the team’s size and strength. “The
team is small. We need to get
people healthy,” she said,
referring to Ann Marie Lucanie’s
second-degree ankle sprain from

the Georgia Tournament this past ,

weekend. Pitt pulled through with
a 3-0 victory and another
tournament title.

This weekend Pitt faces Penn
State. “It’s a big game
psychologically, too,” Lantagne

__._.

said. “We’re the two best teams in 1
the East,” she added. Pitt is 

currently ranked 17th, and the
Nittany Lions are 10th.

“Pitt’s always been an underdog
team, but this year we're the team
to beat,” Lantagne said. “There’s
been an attitude change. Now
others see us as better, so we're
