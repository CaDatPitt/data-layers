Pitt discloses  
swine ﬂu ﬁgures

Drew Singer
Editor in Chief

After  reﬁisingtosayhowmany
expectedcasesofswineﬂuarehereat
Pitt, oﬁicials revealed informationabout
suspected cases in both students and
staff members yesterday aitemoon.
Dun'ngtheﬁrst14daysthatthevirus
wasknowntobeoncampus,14.2st11-
dents and two staff members reported
thatthey hadan“inﬂuen2a—lil<e illness,”
the most speciﬁc diagnosis one can re-

ceive withoutalabtesttoconﬁrmthat V

the illness is, intact, the H1N1virus.

Duringthe secondtwo—weekperiod
—whichjustended—about50 people
on any given day had an inﬂuenza—like
illness at Pitt.

On average, known cases at Pitt
saw symptoms last an average of 2.7
days, and most people said they were
symptom~free within ﬁve. '

The statistics were revealed byjay
Frerotte, the director of Pitt’s Depart-
ment of Health and Safety, in a letter

to the editor earlier today. See page 5
to readthefull letter.

The letter to the editor came four
days after a Pitt News editorial con-
demned Pitt for withholding the sta-
tistics. Frerotte declinedto reveal swine
ﬂu statistics lastweek, saying, “We don’t
want to get into the numbers game.

There are active cases on campus, but
there is no cause for panic.”
Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment spokesman Dave Zazac said yes-
terdaythatwhile many institutions are
optingto reporttheirﬁgure ofsuspected
swineﬂu cases, thehealth communityis
focusing less on head counts this year.
, “The bottom line is we want to
tell you where the ﬂu is, not where it’s
-been,” he said.

Instead, Zazac said looking for
spikes in reported inﬂuenza—like ill-
nesses is a better indicator.

“Weallwish the numberwas zero,”
Frerotte said, “butinaglobalpandemic,
zero is not afeasible expectation.”

Letter to theieditor

To the Editor,
I applaud The Pitt News for its

recent features ‘on H1N1 ﬂu. The .

University has been preparing
for the arrival of this new strain
of ﬂu since its emergence. It must
be noted that H1N1 cases are only
conﬁrmed through laboratory
testing in a very limited number of

‘ instances, such as for those who

are hospitalized. The current guid-
ance is for individuals to take action
when they have an inﬂuenza—like ill-

ness (ILI). The University has been
tracking the number of individuals
who self—report an ILI.

In the 14 days since the reports
of ILI on the Pittsburgh campus,
new cases of ILI have been self—re-
ported each day. There have been
142 students and two staff members
that have self—reported ILI on the
Pittsburgh campus. There have not
been any reports of ILI on other Pitt
campuses. During the second full

_ week of this period, the number of

persons with ILI on any given day
has remained around 50. The aver-
age duration of inﬂuenza-like symp-
toms has been 2.7 days and nearly
all of the individuals have reported
that they were free of symptoms
within ﬁve days. The symptoms
continue to be relatively mild and
more than 60 percent of students
that report ILI have recovered in
one to two days. »

These numbers mean that ILI
remains present on the Pittsburgh

campus and that students should
continue to follow the ﬂu preven-
tion measures and the responses
to ILI that the University has been
promoting: Wash your hands, cover
your sneezes and coughs, report ILI
to the ﬂu hotline at 412-624-2222,
self-isolate at home with ILI and
stay informed through wvvw.pitt.
edu/swine—ﬂu.
We all wish the number was zero,
but in a global pandemic, zero is not
_a feasible expectation. While ILI is

impacting a relatively small propor-

tion of our student population, we '

must remain diligent in our control
measures and in our self—reporting
and self-isolating in order to protect
those in our population who might
be at higher risk for serious compli-
cations from this new strain of the
H1N1 virus.

Director, Department of Health
and Safety

Harvard’s new threads

One of the great staples in college
fashion is the T-shirt, sweatpants or
hoodie emblazoned with a school’s
logo. Most colleges seem compla-
cent wearing school spirit in this
fashion — not Harvard.

Ranked No. 1 in the 2010 U.S.
News 8: World Report armual “col-
lege rankings, the proverbial top-
dog university, Harvard, recently
announced it’s going to start its own
nationally distributed line of cloth-
ing named Harvard Yard. But don’t
expect the $10 price tags you might
ﬁnd on typical college wear.

Oxford shirts start at $165 while
sports coats could cost $495. Come
February, check your local depart-

ment store for the full lineof high-
end clothing, but please don’t max
out your credit card. I

It must be noted that the univer-
sity intends to use the revenue for
ﬁnancial aid — a seemingly noble

cause as tuition is $37,012 for the ’

2009-10 academic year. But why
did they instigate such a brazen
measure by selling an exclusive line
of pricey attire? This clothing line
touts the school’s preppy typecast
that it should, in the wake of the
21st century, be working to over-
come. Everyone knows Harvard is a
premier university with a very rich
history, but an ostentatious act like
this screams elitism. -

Protesters’ requests unreasonable

A group of six local and national

lawsuit on Friday against the city, the
state Department of Conservation
and Natural Resources and the Secret
Service, The Post-Gazette reported.
The suit alleges that the three defen-

A 2002 study revealed that 91 to
93 percent of Down syndrome preg-

Many potential parents areunwillingto

these fears are often exacerbated by a

This history reveals not only a lack of ethics in regard to the mentally

disabled, but also a severe underestimation of the capabilities of

those who are born with Down syndrome.

You getthe idea. Perhaps, then, we
might consider these reﬂections and
apply them to an issue of today that
might not be as eminent but is none-
theless in dire need of grave reﬂection
and consideration, and thatis the way
we perceive the nauire of Down syn-

shelter for the purpose of overnight

Importantly, the parks director
has not given these groups permis-
sion to camp in the parks, it would
be almost impossible to adequately
supervise these groups while they
camp, and it would be a violation of
city code for these organizations to
set up tents overnight. ’

These regulations govern the ac-
tivity of every resident of this city
throughout the year, and I see no
reason why thousands of protesters
from out of town should be able to
violate these regulations based on
acclaim that the First Amendment
protects camping.

A statement on g2omedia.org,
self-described as an “information
clearinghouse and media support
for dissent at the Pittsburgh G—2O
Summit,” called on activists to f‘claim
Pittsburgh parks for the people” and

“affirm the people’s right to use the -

people’s commons for our activi-
ties.” -

But these activists don’t necessar-
ily represent the will of the residents
of this city, and their assertion of a
right to our public parks to use for
their activities is ridiculous. The citi-
zens of this city whose taxes pay for

tending press corpswill be payingfor
their lodging while they’re here. But
instead of paying for their housing,
activists are asking a federal judge to
allowthem to violate city regulations
and set up tent cities in our parks.
There is nothing more undemo-

from out of town asking a federal
judge to overturn the judgment of
the elected leaders of the city of Pitts-

The G-20 Summit itself repre-

have to confront the potential for

Colin Hay »
Album: American Sunshine
Label: Compass Records

Rocks Like: Men at Work, Sting
Grade: B— .

Colin Hay performs ruggedly upbeat
pop well. His music carries a masculine
edge without boasting about conquests
and beer. ’ V

Instead, it holds a paternal voice of ex-
perience that appeals to 20-something Zach
Braff—types and crosses generational gaps.
Braff might havepublicized Hay’s,lwork

through appearances on “Scrubs” and songs
in “Garden State,” but you can hardly credit J

the actor for the musician’s success.

Haytplays in a laid-back, yet well thought.-
out style throughout the record.

American Sunshine surrounds listeners
in dense melodies, but Hay knows when
to add bongos to give his music a chill ef-
fect. “Oh California” could relax the most
overworked among us, evoking images of
sun and sand. Even when the sound he-
comes richer and more complex vocally,
like in “Prison Time,” that feeling of ease
remains. _ V -

The female backing vocals on “No Time”
add a Neko Case-like quality that nicely
complements Hay’s lower melody.

The song rings cheerful without becom-

' ing sappy.

Throughout, Hay tries on styles reminis-
cent of country western Elvis tunes to those
that resemble a lighter, acoustic version of
Morrissey. ’ V .

Bongos or ballads, Colin Hay’s music re-

mains all his own. Rest assuredthere won’t '

be any melancholy verses in either style.

Album: Ocean Eyes
Label: Universal Republic

Sounds Like: Lights, Postal Service, Death Cab‘

Grade: A-

Who says insomnia is abad thing? Musician

Adam Young claims it’s what led to his compo- .

sitions and the creation of the musical project
called Owl City.

Experimenting with electronic music until it
soundsfarmore naturalthan expected, Owl City’s
newest album Ocean Eyar bounces about in style
between pop, orchestral and a sharper rock.

The funny thing is, no matter what style the
electronics are imitating, it almost always works.
Somehow it stays peaceﬁil and charming.

In» addition, the vocalist’s voice harmonizes
perfectly with the pitch of the keyboard and in-
tricate sounds. The result is a captivating set of
songs with :a multitude of sounds to share.

Lyrics are not average at all -— the opening
songhas one line that en , “  Every mushroom
cloud / Has asilver ﬁning.” Rack the points up for
sharp—witted creativity. H

No song will ever come out and forthrightly
explain what it means. It’s like arefreshingpoetry
reading available on.your iPod.

Even if a sad element emerges in any of the
songs, the vibe consistently.remains passive,
allowing for tranquility and enjoyment in one
round regardless of the lyrics’ tone.

Perhaps the best lesson that can be picked
up is, “I’d rather pick ﬂowers / Instead of ﬁght
/ And rather than ﬂaunt my style / I’d ﬂash you
a smile.”

V And while Owl City seems to drilt in its own
little world of music, its poetry can have a place
in the real world, too.

Band: Ballyhool
Album: C/J€€7‘J‘.’ .
Label: Surfdog

Sounds Like: Sublime meets Yellowcard

_ Grade: B+

Every relationship has a story, and every
story can be told in song.

Ballyhoo! uses Cheers! to tell tales about
relationships, from the wonderful begin-
nings of what might be ﬁrst love to the evils
of a friendship’ going sour and of course, the
inevitable breakup.

Relationship drama and wonders alike
are conveyed through lyrics that aren’t really
remarkable compositions but still hold some
meat on their metaphorical bones — take a
listen to “Paper Dolls,” a personal favorite.

Vocals alone will not impress listeners
with a wide range of octave coverage, and
instead the band’s focus goes to what instru-
ments can be used to bulk up and complete
the song.

Ballyhoo! has a mean drummer who pro- _

vides the perfect percussion base to go with
the mellow surfer-dude guitar riffs. Every
song is almost propelled forward by percus-
sion alone.

' They also have an awesome sound man-

ager who perfectly mixes the guitar and bass ‘

with any effects needed to complete the emo-
tional vibe the band strives to achieve.

In the end, the album’s accompaniment
is done so well that every song has an easy-
to—like melody.

There is no unnecessary dwelling on the
relationship, and no tears will be found un-
less someone is justtrying to cry.

And honestly, why do that when you could
dance along to mellow rock music instead?

 

Common items typically given away in raffle
contests include food, gift certiﬁcates and

...people really need bags
to carry all the literature
they pick up!

Annabelle Clippinger

Despite Pittsburgh’s industry-focused

heritage _— we aren’t known as the Steel

City for nothing — the city’s cultural scene
is thriving with music, theater, dance, art
exhibitions and more. Representatives from
more than 30 arts and cultural organizations
will have booths at the Arts Fair, including
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, The Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra, The Pittsburgh Opera,
the Carnegie museums and the Andy Warhol

Museum. The University’s dance and music V

departments will also be represented.
Students can stop by the booths of any of
the organizations in attendance to pick up
information, buy tickets, sign up for hands-
on workshops and get on their mailing lists

l to ﬁnd out more throughout the year.

Annabelleclippinger, the director of the
Pitt Arts Program, said there is an abun-
dance of pamphlets and information for
students to pick up. u

“Every year I always think, ‘Oh my good-
ness, people really need bags to carry all the
literature they pick up!”’ Clippinger said.

Clippinger said that this year, the Uni-
versity Book Center has agreed to donate
bags so students won’t need to bring their
own. The Book Center will also have a table
at the fair promoting its art books.

The Pitt Arts Fair is a good opportunity to receive free T—shirts, tickets or even pointe shoes"

PittArts<7

Several organizations will have give-
aways, like free T—shirts or raﬁles for free
tickets or souvenirs — the Pittsburgh Ballet
has been known to raﬁle off pointe shoes
in the past. This year, for the ﬁrst time, the
Arts Fair will feature live musical perfor-
mances.

“We have a guitarist coming, and I think
two violinists. They won’t perform sets but
just intermittently — it should be very ﬁm,”

Open tryouts rare occurrence

The Pitt baseball team held tryouts last week, but it doesn’t look like anyone will walk on, an increasing trend aroundthe country

While the baseball team is comprised mostly of scholarship players,

like Josh Smith, there is a slight chance of walking on..

There are two roads to college
sports.

The first road takes a high
school player through heavy re-
cruiting, close examination and
an athletic scholarship.

The second road, though,
takes a player through the chal-

open tryout this past week,
when the Panthers coaching staff
searched for hidden gems and
missing pieces.

For coach Joe Jordano, the
open tryouts mark an important
part of the offseason.

“We have added a few players
over the years that have had an
impact on our program,”_]ordano
said.

Hopeful prospective Panthers

though Jordano notes some try-
out participants have gone orsgto
don Panthers jerseys in the past,
it’s an exception to the rule.

“Rarely do we see a player that
has a major impact,” Jordano
said. “The high majority of our
roster will consist of recruited
players.”

Not everybody went home
disappointed, though.

“We are currently looking at

Walk-ons —~ non-scholarship
athletes who make the team
through tryouts —— are the for-
gotten part of a collegiate athletic
program. Some Walk-ons are in-
vited by the coaching staff, while
others make the team through an
open tryout system.

But nobody said making a college

roaming center ﬁeld or pitching

roughly 10 that tried out. Jordano
didn’t name the player because

he hasn’t made a ﬁnal decision

But why only one?

Baseball isn’t as popular as it once

was, but there is a way to flx that

If the MLB wants to compete with the NFL, it needs to look to its past.

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

Professional baseball has some prob-
lems. V

Many fear younger generations
aren’t getting into baseball and the
sport is slowing dying out. A few
reasons people fear this include the
extensive length of games, the lack
of exciting action, competition froln
other sports —- football, and to an

extent basketball, have grown more
popular—— and, as always, peoplelike
to write eulogies.

The realissue with baseballis that
its popularity is waning in the United

States. While attendance ﬁgures are '

up, it’s just not as signiﬁcant to our
society as itused to be. Inplaces like
Latin America andjapan, baseball is
thriving, and that’s evident just by
looking at the top talent in the ma-
jors. A

Still, Americans like to root for

Americans. Baseball might not be an
Olympic sport anymore, but we have
the World Baseball Classic, and we
wanttoseeourcountrywinthepresti—

’ gious event. So then something needs
to be done to get younger generations j P

ofkids backonthe baseball diamond,
and I know exactly what that is.

We need a sequel to the Steroids
Era in Major League Baseball.

Sure, somethinkthe eraisn’tover,
since we still don’t know every player

According to Rens, Dooley’s consistency
makes heran excellent role model for her team-
mates. . A

“[Dooley] has come throughinso many clutch
situations in the past, and this yearl think she’s
brought it to a different level as a senior,” Rens
said. “She becomes agreat example for everyone
because she just gets the job done every day.”

Through the ﬁrst11 matches Dooley, amiddle
hitter, has racked 148 kills, a team—high 58 total
blocks and nine service aces.

At the outside hitter position, Town has
been transforming games with her play and at—
titude. V

“One of the great things about [Town] is that
she brings alot of energy and enthusiasm to the
court,” Rens said. “She’s the type of player whose
teammates love being on the court with her.”

Her ability to score points and play defense
has made Town :1 very versatile player on the
outside. She has accumulated a team—best 168
kills, 76 digs and seven service aces this season.
Rens indicated that Town’s effort makes the play-
ers around her better.

“[Town is] playing [her] position so well that

the other people can be more effective doing —

their jo ,”Rens said

Dooley is one of those teammates who ben-
eﬁts from Town’s presence.

“[Town] has had a fantastic season so far
and what she is bringing to the court — her big
swings, defense and compeﬁtive attitude -
make her incredibly fun to play wi ,” Dooley
said. *

Both players have been recog11ized for their
efforts early in the season, as they were each
named to the all-tournament teams of the
Sheraton Riverside Cardinal Classic and the

Nittany Lion Invitational.

“It’s such an honor,” Town said. “It’s nice
to be rewarded for working hard and playing
hard. It’s nice to know that people appreciate
what we do.”

This past weekend, another accolade rolled in
for Dooley, as shewas named to the All~Comcast
Challenge team.

Jen Zettl I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Meagan Dooley (No. 13) and Amy Town (No. 8) are leading a young Panther team.

“Being recognized atall ofthese tournaments
is an honor because it means I’m doing my job
for our team. It’s only a plus that other teams and
coaches recognize this,” Dooley said. .

Rens hasbeen pleasedwith the performances
of Dooley and Town.

“The attention that both of them received,
being named to the all-toumament teams,.’was
very well deserved,” Rens said. “They’re two of
the hardest working individuals on the team.”

Despite the performances of Dooley and
Town, the Panthers have lost their last ﬁve
matches after beginning the year with a 5-1 re-
cord. Town attributed the team’s poor results to
inadequate “mental focus.” . S

Rens believesthatthisweekends Pitt Blue and
Gold Toumamentwillbe an opportunity forhis
team to get back on the right track.

~“Thi's group plays with a lot of pride and a
lot of heart, and they would love to display that

again at home,” Rens said.

The Panthers will take on Valparaiso on Sat-
urday, and they play Maryland Eastern Shore and
Youngstown State on Sunday. Dooleyis conﬁdent
that a remm toithe Fitzgerald Field House will
also mark a returnto victory. .

“With a solid week of practice we will have
timeto get our mental game backwhere it needs
to be,” Dooley said. “I have no doubt that we will
come back with a 3-0 [record this] weeken ”

current roster.”

L Participants have almost no time to im-
press —— the open tryouts are a one—night
run through a gauntlet of fielding, hitting
';and pitching. According to Jordano, the
gtryout consists of “a pro-style baseball
workout.” ,

A participant has to immediately catch

§'.the eye of assistant coach Danny Lopaze,
lwho serves as recruiting coordinator.
‘ Despite the long odds, tryout partici-
.__pants are still given an opportunity. not
fofferetl at every school. Not all colleges
have open tryouts like Pitt does.

Some major baseball schools,including
_Louisiana State, which won the College
World Series last year, do hold tryouts
gin the fall, but others such as Texas and
5.Nebraska limit walk-ons to a few invited

ecruits, or players the school liked out
of high school but not enough to offer a
scholarship to. . '
_ “We used to [have open tryouts],” Ne-
braska baseball spokesperson Shamus
“McKnight said. “But when the roster limit
of 35 — 27 scholarship, 8 walk-ons -4 was
imposed by the NCAA, it eliminated the

Most walk-ons recruits offered

need.”

Indeed, rules and regulations largely
control how a program handles the tryout
process. Some colleges want to take on a
multitude ofVwalk—ons but can’t because
of budget limitations and ﬁxed roster
limits.

Bill Pennington of The New York Times
reported in 2002 that many colleges looked
to phase out walk-ons altogether in smaller
sports for this veryreason.

' But for other schools that lack a large
number of baseball scholarships to hand
out, walk-ons and open tryouts are cru+
cial.

Michigan last year built a winning
team around the system ——..five of its nine
starting position playersiwalked on. One
of them, Tim Kalczynski, is now a team
captain.

In addition, there’s no harm for upstart
programs to search in unlikely places to
ﬁnd talent. Though improbable, there may
always be a diamond in the rough in open
tryouts.

. And as long as it can happen, Pitt
and other colleges will continue to hold

.' them.

likely used them in the past are still playing or
because players are still getting caught using
them. '

Because steroids are on everyone’s mind,
now is the time to strike. Steroids might be the
vampires of sports. They’ll get kids talking and
excited about sports. And as Greg Maddux said
inan old commercial, “Chicks digthe longball.”

I Inject Ryan Braun with some steroids and he

might become baseball’s Robert Pattinson.
Sure, some might not agree with bringing

 backsteroids,butrememberhowﬁintheywere?

‘ They made baseball more fan-interactive than '

it had ever been.

The best part of the Steroid Era is that fans
got to be detectives. Hey, in 1996 the Orioles’
Brady Anderson hit 50 home runs. Primarily a
leadoff hitter, Anderson’s previous career high

 was21homerunsbackin1992.Hishighesttotal

after 1996 came in 1999 when he hit 24. Those

. were the only three years he hit more than 20

I home runs duringhis 15-yearcareer. Well, that’s
» -peculiar. Steroids! Case closed!

Thentherewas LuisGonzalez, who turned 30

His homer totals inhis ﬁrst few years aﬁ:ert11rn-
ing30: 23, 26, 31 and 52 Thatlastyearwas 2001,
the same year he and the Diamondbacks won
the World Series. Hmm, you think steroids had
anything to do with that? Book ’em, Datmol

Put steroids backinthe game and justwaitto
see what fading stars have a career resurgence
or what player in his early 30s ﬁnally makes
the majors after a decade in the minors. Then it
would be up to us, the fans, to decide whether it

0 was done naturally or with some of tl1at oh-so-

. sweet injected assistance.

Duringsteroids Era I, any game gave you the

l chance to strain your neck trying to follow each
L gargantuan blast. Each season there was a race

to see which number was higher: home runs a
player hit in one season vs. pounds of muscle
they put on since the previous season.

So why notbringthatback? Infact, getinon

i try it already by having fans text in their votes

for player of the game, but that’s not enough.
