Second-half
run helps
Panthers
past Bulls 

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

In a span of about two second-half
minutes, the Pitt men’s basketball
team transformed from struggling
against a last-place team in the
conference to leading it by double
digits. ‘

That passage of time proved
vital to No. 23 Pitt in securing its
10th Big East win this season, a 64-
44 triumph over South Florida on
Wednesday night at the Petersen
Events Center.

The Bulls (10-17, 1-14 Big East)
beat the Panthers (22-7, 10-6 Big
East) in the two contests between
the teams last season and returned
the majority of the players that did
so. But Pitt wouldn’t let. history re-
peat itself, ensuring victory with a
strong second-half performance
after a sloppy ﬁrst half.

The decisive Pitt scoring run,
started by redshirt junior for-
ward Talib Zanna’s converted
drive and punctuated by back-to-
back 3—p0inters by redshirt senior
guard Tray Woodall and redshirt
freshman guard Durandjohnson,
turned a close game into a 10-point
advantage for the Panthers..

What triggered the sudden

, shift, according to the players, was
head coachjamie Dixon’s directive
to just go and play, a mindset Dixon
said became permanent just before
the Panthers stretched their lead.

“I think guys started to settle
down. Coach was. giving us some

Envoy calls
for peace
in Sudan

Brett Wilson
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

Despite years of conflict, there’s
reason to hope that Sudan and
South Sudan won’t engagelin large-
scale war again, a former U.S. am-
bassador and current envoy to Su-
danand South Sudan told a crowd
at Pitt Wednesday afternoon.

Princeton Lyman, who served
as ambassador to Nigeria from
1986 to 1989 and to South Af-
rica from 1992_to 1995, spoke to
a tightly packed 60 people in a
Posvar Hall classroom about his
work as a mediator between Sudan
and South Sudan. ,

Pitt Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs’ Ford In-
stitute for Human Security, which
works to promote effective re-
sponses to severe threats faced by
individuals and their communities
as a result of conﬂict, sponsored
the, lecture.

The two countries were once a
united Sudan; however, civil war

I led to the independence of South

Sudan in 2011. Lyman recognized
that the longtime conﬂicts cannot
be resolved simply by giving South
Sudan independence from Sudan.

On July 9, 2011, after years of
ﬁghting with the northern portion
of Sudan, South Sudan seceded
after a referendum indicated that
99 percent of those livingsin South
Sudan favored a schism between
the north and south.

Sudan has made international
headlines for the past several
years due to conﬂicts all over the

countrfi, namely the Darfur conﬂict in the
western portion of Sudan. .

The Darfur conﬂict is estimated to have
killed 200,000 to 400,000 people, as there
are disagreements among governmental
and media sources on the actual death toll.
Many were displaced from their homes and
relocated to refugee camps.

“There are many unresolved issues in Su-
dan that have led to ﬁghting, and when there
are attempts at peace, the people of Dar-
fur are nervous that the government won’t

implement the resolutions,” Lyman said. ~

“And quite frankly, the government hasn’t
been enforcing new laws well enough.”

On a brighter note that drew some light
applause, Lyman spoke optimistically of the
conﬂict between the two nations. He feels
that the two countries will never again go
to full-scale war, or at least at any time in
the foreseeable future.

At the same time, he reminded everyone
of the long and contentious history between
the now separate countries.

“There are lies between both sides of the
conﬂict, and a deep sense of mistrust has
developed over time,” Lyman said. “Remem-
ber that there are 20 years of memories of
war between the two sides, and that makes
just about anything that involves both Sudan
and South Sudan difficult to accomplish.”

Several people in attendance were long-
time followers of the Darfur conflict and
have hope for peace for the first time in a
long time. Susan Morgans, a resident of
the East Liberty neighborhood of Pitts-
burgh, has taken many trips to Darfur
with humanitarian groups over the past
10 years.

“It is a conﬂict that has led to many
deaths and has led to even more families
being displaced and forced to ﬂee to neigh-
boring countries. It has destroyed a culture
and away of life, and the only thing we can
do for,Darfur is have hope for better days
ahead,” Morgans said.

Lyman said the U.S. has donated about
$7.5 billion to the conﬂict in Darfur over
the past several years. He also noted that
longtime conﬂicts have led to an increase in
violence in the region over the past several
months.

Freshman Reena Naik said the content
of the lecture aligned with her area of study.

“I was here because I’m part of the Global
Studies program here at Pitt and I wanted
to know more about Sudan-U.S. relations,
as well as hear about the current issues in
Sudan and.South Sudan.’’ 6

Lyman said he hopes for peace and pros-
perity in relations between Sudan and South
Sudan, as well as the continued involvement
of international supporters for peace in
the region.

“Peace is a complex and long process,”
he said. I

  Buck Oakland tradition: Be
relaxed on your 21st birthday

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

After seeing numerous movies
about what college is like, we
rolled into Oakland as freshmen
imagininggdormsvwith question-
able sanitation, new freedom, a
bunch of friends and house par-
ties littered with red Solo cups.

Whether or not this is what
we’ve all experienced college
to be, there’s some sort of odd
culture behind the long—antici-
pated 21st birthday, after which
you will never risk receiving
the dreaded underage drinking
citation. The 21st is a selfish
birthday, and it will undoubt-
edly be your most exciting day
yet. Hopefully, if you’ll be able to
remember it the next morning.

It’s long awaited: the vast ma-
jority of us won’t hit this prime
age until sometime during junior
year. You plan the party, but only
sort of. Through Facebook, an

event is created, and you and
your roommates pick an event
picture and at great event title:
“Tina’s Tipsy Tuesday 21st!” or
“Let’s Get Wasted: Joe’s 21!” All

Happy 226th birthday, Pitt:
 theﬁlture of our campus

Rosie McKinley
Columnist

On the occasion of our Univer-
sity’s 226th birthday, Pitt stu-
dentsacross campus are donning
throwback colors and attending
the “Throwback Thurs day” event
in the Union. But rather than get-
ting stuck in a funk of nostalgia
for Tony Dorsett or the old Pitt
script, today has this history ma-
jor thinking toward the future.
What will the headlines of the
next century at Pitt proclaim?
Following a hovercraft-rid-

, ing Pathﬁnder, let’s take a tour

across campus in 2113.

The first noticeable change
to campus is the green Cathe-
.dral Lawn, which, after years of
fruitless reseeding every spring,
has been replaced by Astro Turf.’

The Quidditch team can be seen

vancements in broom technolo-
gy, Pitt Athletics can legitimately

« claim a high-octane team.

A pack of exchange students
from Mars stroll past a group of

Ugg—wearing hipsters who are ,

ironically listening to the good
music of an earliertage. Carly Rae
Jepsen and One Direction enjoy
a newfound fame.

Speaking of music, History
of Jazz will be replaced with a
History of Hip—Hop course fo-
cusing on the social signiﬁcance
of Kanye West, Wiz Khalifa and
Eminem. Meanwhile, in other
generalxeducation require-
ments, students taking Intro
to Psychology will be taught by
modern technology’s best pro-
fessional teaching cyborg. And

it is still voted the class students
are most likely to sleep through
in The Pitt News’ annual “Best
of Edition.”.

random kid who lived across the hall from
you sophomore year. Amount of effort?
Five minutes, maybe six if you’re using
Pitt’s wireless connection.

The rest of the responsibility is on
your gang of drinking buddies. They show
up, and you are in the spotlight. They have
an added unspoken rule, too. They have
to be more sober and put together than
you are for the duration of the evening,
because nobody is allowed to be sloppier
than the birthday boy or girl.

Celebrating yourself is always fun, es-
pecially when you don’t ever open your
wallet for the occasion. OK, maybe you
forked over some money for the carbs
everyone ate beforehand in your apart-
ment. But when you actually hit Forbes
Avenue, those Viking horns from Peter’s
Pub identify you as the king or queen for
the evening, and the peasants of Oakland
will worship and honor your rule by buy-
ing you more shots. .

Wow, what could be better than that?

Waking up with a shots tally on your
arm in permanent marker? You’d better
wear long sleeves for the rest of the week,
because that won’t come off easily. A hor-
riﬁc hangover? Your best “cure” won’t
even be good enough. Spending the rest
of your birthday nauseous? Perfect.

There is something a little horrify-
ing about this drinking culture that sur-
rounds our college lifestyle. Turning 21
can be a dangerous evening.

Sure, many consider the 21st-birthday
ritual a rite of passage. You are legally
allowed to consume alcohol. At 18, you
could buy cigarettes, join the army and
vote, but now you are allowed to get drunk
with the grown-ups.

But who’s to say that this means you
have to get completely obliterated the
night you turn 21? Let me rephrase that

‘ — the minute you turn 21. Because you

have to line up outside of Peter’s Pub so
when the clock strikes midnight and Cin-
derella loses her ball gown and beautiful
carriage, you are downing your first legal
shot.

Keep it simple. Especially for those of
you who celebrate on weeknights. Maybe

you’d already planned to take your birth-
day off from your other responsibilities,
but what about your friends who are par-
tying alongside your staggering self?
They might have classes the next day,
too. Don’t get too disappointed when they
can’t stay out until last call as 2 a.m. draws
near. They obviously want to help you
celebrate, or they wouldn’t have joined
the fun. But seeing as those ofus who are
21 are juniors and seniors, chances are
that there are important classes, jobs and
internships to worry about, too.

Of course, I am a hypocrite. I turned
21 and felt as though I had to follow the
extravagant Oakland birthday tradition,
and it seemed very important. I have tak-
en friends out on their 21st birthdays to
get their horns and a shirt from Heming-
way’s that was much too large for girls
hovering just above 5 feet tall.

Maybe it’s time for the tradition to be
a bit less sloppy and more relaxed. Let’s
aim to remember those nights. OK, go
scan your ID for the first time and let

the bouncer wish you a happy birthday. ,

Does there have to be a tally of shots,
though? Is it in the rule book that we
must throw up?

Enjoy a few beverages with some of-

-/age friends. Find a new bar outside Oak-

land that none of you have tried before.
Broaden your horizons and order some-
thing you’d never normally go for. Still
expect your friends to pay, though. It is
your birthday, after all.

And don’t forget about your under-
age friends. They’ll want to be included
at some point, too. I’m not condoning
underage drinking, so go out to dinner
somewhere nicer than the usual burrito
joint early in the evening, maybe catch a
movie sometime or just hang out and eat
a pizza. Exclusion is no fun, and this is
coming from someone who is always the
youngest in the group.

The big two-one does not have to be an
event after which we should worry about
our reputations through social media.
In reality, it shouldn’t be, and it’s time
we all think twice about that headache-
inducing evening.

You have the rest of your life to go
crazy. Responsibly, of course. I _

MCKINLEY

Aiken’s revival tour and, thus, redefines
an “all time low.”

I can’t quite hear the voice of the Path-
ﬁnder leading us as we pass the loud con-
struction outside Hillman Library, but I
think he said something about the pa-
tio nearing completion. Students on the
ground floor still struggle to find outlets.

The Pathﬁnder gives_some fun facts
about campus history when we get to
Posvar Hall. After being mistaken for an
alien spaceship during the great Martian
invasion of 2076, Posvar was apparently
named a national historic landmark as a
lasting reminder of architecture’s never-
to—be—repeated Brutalistic period.

We take a quick break to use the gen-
der—neutral bathrooms in David Lawrence
Hall. Aside from a few homophobic do-
nors, no one was offended when Pitt ad-
ministration ﬁnally decided to join the
rest of the 22nd century and revise its
retrogressive transgender policy regard-
ing public restrooms on campus.

Crossing the skywalk from David Law-
rence, I learn that due to the expansion of
Litchﬁeld Towers, Hemingway’s became
the basement of Tower D and now accepts
dining dollars. The Drunk Druid becomes
the highest-selling shot pitcher at the bar.

Meanwhile, labor unrest by Sodexo
workers resulted in the temporary closure
of Market Central. The meal plans remain
overpriced, butthe’ cafeteria reopened
featuring more bathrooms, as post-Mar-
ket poops became increasingly violent.

The William Pitt Union provides in?
sight on the biggest changes. On Thurs-
days, FeelGood now donates money to
end obesity in Ethiopia and Dean’s Hour
features a holographic version of Dean
Humphrey promising OCC credit for any
student even thinking about the OCC. Ben-
eﬁts include a green cord'and_ standard-
izing any extracurricular you have at Pitt
into a generic formula.

Student Government Board has been
mostly overwhelmed with the ongoing
debate regarding the readership program,
but did make the tough decision to ﬁnally
call SafeRide'r what it really is: a free ride

home when you are just too cold towalk V

to your Bouquet Gardens apartment on
McKee. In the TeleFact tradition, the
Board continues paying for Wi—Fi on the
10A even though every student can access
Internet through the personal routers
implanted in their wrists. The Board also
declared that since Pitt students have been
singing “Sweet Caroline” for so long, it
actually is a tradition.

Pitt Dance Marathon is expected to
raise more than $60,000. Greek Life
made an Allocations request to rent the
Fitzgerald Field House for $100,000 for
the event. The Board approved the request
in full in line with the Allocations recom-
mendation.

A campaigning SGB member’s plan for
a zip line between Sutherland Hall and
the Cathedral fell through after nesting
falcons attacked. Although no students
were hurt, a considerable number of
squirrels were lost in the three-day siege
that canceled class for the ﬁrst time since
Snowpocalypse.

In state governmental news, during
a decade of Republican governorship
refusal to raise budget appropriations,

Pitt sold the Titusville campus to natural \

gas companies. A brief name change to
Marcellus Shale University ensued. The
Panther was temporarily replaced by the
Fightin’ Frackers to reﬂect the change.

Pitt basketball was ranked as a hot
preseason favorite before losing in the
second round of March Madness featuring
a field of 128 teams. While the team didn’t
score big, the Campus Secular Organiza-
tion does'when the alma mater’s closing
line of “God preserve thee evermore” is
removed. _

Back here in the present, thinking of
that far—off evermore can make us un-
comfortable. That’s why we are wont,
on birthdays like today, to dwell in the
achievements of the past. But take a min-
ute today to imagine a Pitt in 2113, or
even just 2014. The 225 years of building
better lives is proof that Pitt is great, but
if our University is to truly be a place of
eternal spring, we should always be striv-

I ing for a strong future. Even if none of us
live to see it.

Except of course, Nordenberg, who

' after a long stint in a cryogenic freeze will

resume his reign as chancellor. I

Staff Writer

“Safe Haven”

Directed by: Lasse Hal-
strom

Starring: Julianne Hough,
Josh Duhamel, David Ly-
ons, Cobie Smulders
Grade: C+

It’s that time of year again when
Nicholas Sparks offers Hollywood
his latest romantic drama, com-
plete with his patented movie for-
mula: attractive people who fall
in love only to face a tragedy, but
then overcome it and live happily
ever after. Unfortunately, the solid
legacy that “A Walk to Remem-
ber” and “The Notebook” started
is long gone, tarnished over and
over again with later entries into
the Sparks anthology, including
last year’s ridiculous, boring ﬂop,
“The Lucky One.”

The cheesy dialogue, awkward
chemistry and choppy switches
between storylines in “Safe Haven”
make the Lasse Halstrom-directed
ﬂicklfairly cringe—worthy for any-

  IMPULSE

Formula makes for dull movie, reminiscent of past Sparks ﬁlms

one who’s looking for more than
ﬂuff. To the ﬁlm’s credit, it does try
to up the cliched romantic drama
ante, adding in an entertaining
element of thrills and suspense to
even out the love fest.

The ﬁlm opens with our hero-
ine, Katie (Julianne Hough), run-
ning through her neighborhood
covered in blood and eventually
banging on her neighbor’s door for
help — a far cry from close—ups of
Zac Efron’s gleaming, sweaty abs
in “The Lucky One.”

Audiences soon learn that Katie
is ﬂeeing an abusive marriage in
Boston, deciding to ditch her old
life and board a bus to the small
seaside community of Southport,
N.C. Enter Alex (Josh Duhamel),
a smart, sensitive and, of course,
outrageously attractive widower
who owns a general store in South-
port with his two young children.
His wife’s death only two years ear-
lier combined with Katie’s para-
noia of being found and her overall
unsolicited rudeness initially im-
pedes the burgeoning relationship.

True to Sparks’ form, Alex
eventually begins to wear down
the chip on Katie’s shoulder, and
sparks (pun intended) start ﬂying.
Alex’s young daughter, who can’t
remember her mother, is instantly

infatuated with Katie, and their
heartwarming interactions add
some much~needed playfulness to
the ﬁlm. Alex’s son, on the other
hand, takes a lot longer to warm up
to Katie, a potentially interesting
complication screenwriters Dana
Stevens and Gage Lansky took
nowhere. Before long, however,
Katie’s dangerous past catches up
with her, and the new, idyllic life
she’s created for herself is threat-
ened.

The chemistry between Alex
and Katie is the best kind that two
extremely attractive people who

ALBUM REVIEW

‘A Good Day toDie Ha’ shows franchise only has four lives

Kenny Ong
Visual Editor

“A Good/Day to Die Hard”
Directed by: John Moore
Starring: Bruce Willis, Jai
Courtney, Sebastian ‘Koch
Grade: C+

It’s been more than two decades
since the ﬁrst “Die Hard,” andjohn

McClane (Bruce Willis) is getting '

too old for this sh*t.

In “A Good Day to Die Hard,”
the “Die Hard” formula remains
the same: snarky underdog cop
McClane stumbles from a small
personal chore into big trouble,
struggles and perseveres at the
last second -— “Yippee-ki-yay,
mother f*cker!” New settings, sup-
porting characters and explosions
have kept the formula fresh and

.* 2&3’

Bruce Willis (left) and Jai Courtney (right) make a gruesome team in “A Good Day to Die Hard.” I

 

the previous three sequels suc-
cessful, but the same can’t be said
for the latest installment in the
series. “A Good Day to Die Hard”
tries to redecorate, but gets too
courageous and hung up on the

’ past.

McClane’s personal chore
this time around is to reconnect
with his estranged and "seemingly
troubled son,Jack (Jai Courtney),
who’s been arrested in Russia for a
litany of crimes. Whenjack turns
out to be a troubled CIA agent,
McClane and son form a reluctant

-partnership to reconcile their dif-

ferences, shoot all the bad guys
andisave the day.

It’s your standard, simple “Die
Hard” story arc, but with an added

a layer of the classical father-son

conﬂict: son runs fromfather,
father re-enters son’s life, son

ALBUM REVIEW

Blues group Western Pennsylvania’s newest album misses mark

Andrew Gretchko
Staff Wrz'ter

Born Again Blues

Western Pennsylvania

Grade: C-

Rocks like: a depressing camp-
fire

For some, the blues is a revered genre
of music. Born out of frustration and
sadness, this artful form of expression
has long been a symbol of the American
character, providing people something
with which to relate during harsh times.

Ironically, local blues group Western
Pennsylvania’s debut album, Born Again
Blues, expresses very little.

After 10 minutes of repetitive guitar
chords titled “Penn Avenue/Bloomﬁeld
Mornings,” Born Again Blues has done
nothing to warrant a revolution in a genre
that has already undergone so much
change. This is not pre-war blues, your
parents’ blues or even today’s blues; it is
a creation all its own, a concept born of
novelist Joseph Ripple and pop veteran
Jeff Betten that seems to have confused

‘ itself.

The next 107 minutes of peaceful gui-
tar chords hardly ﬁt the description of
blues. The humming, strumming and bird
chirping of this album are better suited
for a ﬁeld of hippies than the Great De-

pression — or even the Great Recession.

Although Born Again Blues eventu-
ally starts to sound depressing, as blues
music often does, it is not because ofits
lyrics ——- many simply consisting of ran-
dom mumblings — but rather the pure
repetition and seeming lack of musical
creativity that makes up the majority of
the album.

Though a wide range of instruments
are used throughout the album, includ-
ing the banjo, organ, cello, ﬁddle and
piano, this variety is lost when Western
Pennsylvania’s daring, yet unoriginal,
concept backﬁres.

Rather than sounding artistic and re-
freshing, Born Again Blues comes off as
lazy, as each track gets darker and the
urge to fall asleep to the ever-present

chirping of crickets that resides in the
background of nearly the entire album
becomes greater. That is, if you can even
discern when one track ends and the next
begins.

The problem with an album like this
is that it’s simply trying too hard, and
it’s trying too hard at too many things.
It tries to make you feel sad, inspired,
contemplative and a slew of other emo-
tions all at the same time. But in the end,
this feels forced.

Western Pennsylvania’s sound shoots
for originality and ends up somewhere
in the middle of a moonlit cornﬁeld in
the 1920s. Born Again Blues is stuck in
a blues fantasy land that most will never
visit. Luckily, it’s not reality. I

SAFE HAVEN

tically running through a bus stop with her
picture deﬁnitely up the tension, the real
drama doesn’t happen until an hour and a
half into the ﬁlm, when he ﬁnally ﬁnds her
in North Carolina. The excitement of it all is
a long time coming, and the choppy switches
between storylines might as well have been
punctuated by a “dun—dun—dunnn.”

This halfhearted tale of a young woman’s
struggle to get her life back and learn to
love again has all the best intentions, but it
ultimately would be right at home debuting
alongside TV movies on Lifetime. A surprise
ending verging on bizarre will leave realists
rolling their eyes and everyone else with
tears in them.

Longtime fans of Sparks should enjoy
the sentiment and overall cliche, but anyone
else with an interest in seeing the ﬁlm will be
much better of}? waiting until it hits Redbox.

<4JFROM PAGE 5

DIE HARD

realizes he is just like his father, accepts it
and is able to mature, having accepted his
identity and father.

Willis and Courtney play out the father-
son conﬂict with one—liners, lighthearted
humor and a lack of depth ﬁtting for a “Die
Hard” movie. You could almost say the mov-
ie is a Father’s Day ﬁlm, just as you could
say the ﬁrst “Die Hard” was a Christmas
movie. Still, the pair’s relationship looks
somewhat true to life.—— true enough to
evoke some sentimentality. McClane, just
like any parent, is the only person who can
make his adult son look like a snot—nosed
kid, referring to jack’s CIA work as kiddie
“spy shit,” or teasing him with the title, “007
of Plainﬁeld, N.j.”

As McClane and Jack rack up the kills,
though, their father—son schtick turns into
an immature, straight—to-VHS gimmick. The
attempt to layer personal depth onto the
ﬁlm’s shallow, action roots ends up making
the ﬁlm tasteless. “Killin’ bad guys,” they
call it, as if they’re playing the same game
they played when Jack was little, but with
real bullets and real people. McClane even
says, “Good shot, son,” afterjack shoots a
faceless bad guy right in the ski mask. The
action—hero psychopathy negates the good
acting in their inevitable reconciliation,
turning it into a campy scene between two
really convincing sociopaths.

You could tune out the ridiculous father-
son dynamic, turn off your brain and try
to enjoy the movie for its action. “A Good
Day to Die Hard” has only one good action
sequence, though — a car chase that occurs
about 20 minutes into the movie. It’s fast-

paced, loud and entertainingly insane. Cars
ﬂy, spin and roll around like a giant invisible
toddler is throwing a tantrum on the road.
The sounds of crunching metal and crashing
glass are like EpiPens to the ears. If you ﬁnd
a sadistic smile on your face, don’t worry.
It’s just a side effect of all that pent-up road
rage leaving your body.

The other two action sequences, on the
other hand, are loud and slow. Loud and
slow works for suspense, but there is no
suspense when you know the heroes can’t
die. Instead, the scenes get drawn out and
boring, such as McClane and jack falling
down a trash chute or McClane and Jack
slow-motion falling into a pool. The slow-
paced action also misses the trademark,
quick and punchy “Yippee—ki—yay” moment
that the ﬁlm’s predecessors are known for.

Besides the falling, the scenes are packed
with nods to previous “Die Hard” ﬁlms. The
intent was probably to pay homage, but it
just comes off as lazy. The ending action
sequence recreates at least three scenes
from previous “Die Hard” ﬁlms. It’s like
they wanted to see how many references
they could ﬁt into one action scene.

' By paying tribute to itself, the movie
misses out on the inspired action that a
“Die Hard” sequel should be offering. Sure,
it’s been a while since the ﬁrst “Die Hard”
(1988), but we’re still in the same franchise
— with the same McClane, no less.

If you’re a die—hard fan, though, or just
a sucker for nostalgia, you’ll appreciate the
nods. You’ll laugh a bit louder than everyone
else at the situational and character humor.
You might even be able to ignore the ﬂawed
action long enough to enjoy it, but there’s
no denying that “A Good Day to Die Hard”
doesn’t reach the standards of previous “Die
Hard” ﬁlms. I

SPRTS   

Seniors Woodall, Taylorspark

   

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

In an era in which the 2012 NCAA
national champion Kentucky Wild-
cats started four freshmen, few
éteams at the collegiate level still
frely as heavily on the play of older
players — especially seniors.

But at Pitt, senior leadership
is a tradition and a hallmark of
the recent decade, which one can
consider the Golden Age of Pan-
fthers men’s basketball. Players like
5Carl Krauser, Aaron Gray, Brandin
Knight and Levance Fields come to
mind when thinking about players
who stuck around in Oakland and
made an impact their senior year.

In 2013, seniors Tray Woodall
and Dante Taylor continue the
tradition of the aforementioned
players, and thetwo led No. 23 Pitt
(22-7, 10-6 Big East) to a 64-44 vic-
itory over South Florida (10-17, 1-14
i'jBig East) on Wednesday evening at
(the Petersen Events Center.

Both Woodall and Taylor
scored in double ﬁgures for Pitt
in the win, a feat no other Panther
accomplished. Woodall tallied a

~ :game-high 14 points, while Taylor
gregistered his ﬁrst double-double

Pitt vic over SouthF|orida

of the season, scoring 12 points off

the bench and gathering a game-

high 10 rebounds.

“It feels real good,” Taylor said
about his double-double. “I’ve been
working hard the last few weeks in
practice, so I just try to carry it over
into these last few games.”

Taylor’s play Wednesday helped
motivate the Panthers, with a
number of the senior forward’s
big baskets coming in moments
that Pitt needed to get its offense
going after a lackluster ﬁrst half

that saw the Panthers shoot 26.9

percent from the ﬁeld.

“That’s him being one of our
senior leaders,” Woodall said. “A
lot of his baskets were in great
moments and great spurts that
we needed and I think he knew
that. He picked guys up and that’s
great to see.”

Taylor’s play in just 20 minutes
off the bench also received notice
from the opposition’s head coach,
Stan Heath.

“He had a good game,” Heath
said. “He’s a senior, I’m sure he
wants to ﬁnish his career on a high
note, and that’s got to be pretty
encouraging for Pitt to maybe see
a light bulb come onand him turn

it on at the end of the year.”

On the Pitt sidelines, head
coach Jamie Dixon said he wit-
nessed this level of play from Tay-
lor lately in practice.

“I thought Dante was terriﬁc.
I feel like he’s been playing really
well in practice, and it’s great to
see,” Dixon said. “I’m just so happy
for him, he’s knocking down free

_ throws, running the ﬂoor well and

doing a great job defensively.”

A As for Woodall, the redshirt
senior point guard notched his
eighth consecutive double—digit
scoring performance in the con-
test.

Woodall leads the team in over-
all scoring at 11.4 points per game
while handing out a team—high 5.2
assists per game.

“I’m just being confident,”
Woodall said about his recent
stretch. “I’m at the end of my rope
here at Pitt, but I’m settled in and
I feel very comfortable out there.
Those guys are deﬁnitely giving
me opportunities and putting me

. in_scoring opportunities and I’m

taking advantage of it.””
“It picks up our conﬁdence,”

Labor Day opener
against Florida State

excites Pitt football fans 

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stcﬁ" Wrz'ter

Moving to the Atlantic Coast
Conference (ACC) from the Big
East means a big jump up in com-
petition for the Pitt football pro-
gram. Apparently, the athletic
department figured it might as
well dive in head first.

On Monday, Pitt announced
its 2013 football schedule. The
most notable announcement —
although it had been rumored
for several weeks —— was that
the Panthers would begin their
ACC days with a Labor Day night
matchup against defending con-
ference champion Florida State
at Heinz Field.

It’s a bold move that market-
ing gurus surely love. Pitt won’t
need to promote ﬁreworks, Rib
Fest, free concerts or anything
other than football to bring fans

"to the stadium for next season’s

opener. The Seminoles finished
last season 12-2 and ranked No.
10 after their Orange Bowl vic-
tory over ‘Northern Illinois;
Florida State can be considered
a modern college football pow-
erhouse.

When was the last time Pitt
scheduled so aggressively?

Surprisingly, its most aggres-
sive scheduling probably came
during the 1970s and 1980s
— the football program’s most
recent period of great success.

In that era, Pitt scheduled
all its regular rivals — Penn
State,‘West Virginia, Syracuse
and Notre Dame — every year. It
also regularly battled big-name
schools such as Florida State,
Ohio State, Oklahoma and Ten-
nessee.

Since moving to the Big East
in 1991, the strength in schedule
slowly deteriorated. In the past
decade, Pitt football faced BCS
opponents in its first game only
three times.

But do the Panthers have a
chance against the Seminoles?
The last time Pitt opened a sea-
son with a -trulyquality oppo-

nent was in 2005 against Notre

Dame.

ESPN’s College GameDay
came to Pittsburgh —- the last
time the popular pre—game
show visited Heinz Field —— to
see two alumni, Dave Wannstedt
and Charlie Weis, begin their
head coaching days at their alma
maters, Pitt and Notre Dame,
respectively. The Irish embar-
rassed the Panthers 42-21 on
national television and went on
to a 9-2 season that put them
in the Fiesta Bowl. Pitt suffered
a disappointing 5-6 campaign.

History isn’t on Pitt’s side to
win its 2013 opener. Even though
Florida State will likely enter
Heinz Field as a top—20 team,
there are plenty of questions
surrounding the Seminoles.

Head coach Jimbo Fisher

never dealt with any coaching
turnover among his staff until
this offseason. Fisher lost six

1 members of his staff and will

break in new offensive and de-
fensive coordinators. The Semi-
noles also begin the season with
a new quarterback, and unlike
Pitt fans with Tino Sunseri, Flor-
ida State fans didn’t like to see
multi-year starter E.J. Manuel
graduate.

Like every other team in the
country, the Seminoles have
plenty of talent to replace —
Florida State sent _13 players to
the recent NFL Scouting Com-
bine. ’

‘Despite all of those ques- 

tions, Florida State boasts high-
ly recruited players to replace its
soon-to—be NFL players.

. It’s no secret that the Semi-
noles come to Heinz Field with
more talent, but Pitt expects a

few things to work in its favor ’“

on Labor Day night.

First, the Panthers know
they’ll have a true home—ﬁeld
advantage. Although games
against rivals such as West Vir-

ginia and N otre Dame always ﬁll ~

Heinz Field, the opposing fan
bases help sell out the stadium.

Dante Taylor recrd his first double-dohle of he seasn asthe Panherskocked

off South Florida 64-44 on Wednesday. Zach Schaffer | Senior Staff Photographer

free reign to just go out and play,” Woodall
said of his head coach. “It gave everybody
conﬁdence.”

In the ﬁrst half, the Panthers made 7 of
their 26 attempts from the ﬁeld and appeared
otherwise listless.

“It was pretty ugly in the ﬁrst half. We knew
weren’t gonna keep missing shots, [though].
We needed to keep ﬁghting,” Woodall said.

And ﬁve minutes after the game resumed,

the energized Panthers ﬁnally played with con- 1

viction to end any hopes South Florida had of
pulling off the upset.
After struggling in recent games, Zanna’s

and-one dunk sparked Pitt. Although he didn’t .

take advantage of the free throw, the shift in
momentum continued with Woodall andJ_ohn—
son draining shots beyond the arc.

The Panthers’ sudden burst of life awoke
the Oakland Zoo student section, about
three—fourths full, and the rest of the 12,320
announced attendance, which seemed to be
simmering with restlessness early on as it
watched Pitt fail to put away the Big East’s
worst team.

The lead would hover around 10 to 12 points
for the duration of the second half until the
Panthers used another late run to add gloss
to the ﬁnal score.

’ Coming off the bench, senior forward Dante
Taylor ﬁnished with a double-double, posting
12 points and 10 rebounds -— his ﬁrst double-
digit scoring game in 19 contests. Woodall also

helped Pitt’s cause signiﬁcantly, tallying 14
points on 4-for-5 shooting.

Coach Dixon was happy with Tay1or’s per-
formance.

“His unselﬁshness is something that’s rec-
ognized by his teammates,” Dixon said about
Taylor. “I’m so happy for him [to be] playing
well down the stretch of his senior year.” _

South Florida head coach Stan Heath
heaped praise on the experienced Woodall.

“He doesn’t get rattled,” Heath said. “When
they needed a basket, they needed to try to keep
us the distance away, he stepped up to the plate
and delivered  [That’s] a sign of maturity.”

After reaching double ﬁgures in points for
the eighth consecutive game, Woodall said
he feels like he’s in a good rhythm with his
offensive game.

“I’m settled in, and I feel very comfortable
out there,” he said.

The Panthers play their ﬁnal home game of
the season on Sunday when they welcome Vil-
lanova to the Petersen Events Center at noon.
Both Taylor and Woodall, Pitt’s two seniors,
said Sunday will be the ﬁrst time their mothers
get to see them play at the Pete. 7

“It’s deﬁnitely going to be emotional,” Tay-
lor said of Senior Day. “I’m excited [for my
family to see me play] —— can’t wait forthat day”

Woodall agreed, although he hopes that he
won’t get choked up.

“I said I was gonna be one of those guys that
probably wouldn’t cry,” he said. 8 :

fans traveling to Pittsburgh to make the

Second, Pitt usually plays to its compe-
ltition. The Panthers lost to Youngstown
State and Connecticut last year, but they
also beat two ranked teams, Virginia Tech
and Rutgers, and gave national-title par-
ticipant Notre Dame its toughest test of
%Lf?the’season.
 Thankfully, Pitt will have some serious

Taylor said of Woodall’s impressive spell.

 

“We all know he can score. We all know he.._ 

can create.”

Most importantly to Taylor, Woodall is
playing his best basketball at the best pos-
sible time.

“For him to pick it up right now, especially
with us about to go in the [Big East] tourna-

ment, that’s real good,” Taylor said. >*«

On Dixon’s end, he attributes Woodall’s
improved offense lately with the strides
Woodall has made in becoming a better de-
fender.

“His defense has been terriﬁc down the
stretch here on different guys that he’s had
to guard,” Dixon said. “We’ve really been
impressed with what he’s doing defensively.
He’s playing better defense, which we’ve al-
ways tried to emphasize to him that better
defense will make him a better offensiv
player to make us a better team.” ‘

Against South Florida, Woodall’s off'ense“'"
helped deliver the dagger in the Bulls’ col-
lective heart with a pair of clutch 3—pointers.
Woodall scored 10 of his 14 points in the
second half, a fact that Heath saw as a decid-
ing factor in the Panthers keeping USF from
clawing back into the game.

“I think you can just tell he’s a senior. He’s
not rattled,” Heath said. “Toward the end
when [Pitt] needed a basket, he stepped up
to the plate. I think that’s a sign of maturity.”
