Deans Confer
On Regulation
Of Speakers

Heads Will Consider

, Committee Proposals

Two proposals for the regula-
tion of outside speakers on cam-
pus were submitted Monday by
a committee during the regular
inonthly meeting of the deans in
the provost ’s office.
The proposals, revealed Rufus H.
Fitzgerald, provost, were discussed
«by the deans and returned to the
committee for further consideration.
Mr. Fitzgerald declined to comment
‘on the contents of the proposals.

Action began for a deﬁnite ruling
concerning outside speakers, par-
ticularly political speakers, after
members of the Pitt Town Meeting
committee hoped to obtain Norman
Thomas, Socialist candidate, but
were informed of a University pol-
icy preventing the appearance of
political candidates on campus.

According to students acquainted
with the problem, a committee con-
sisting of three faculty advisers and
two students chosen by the Student-
Faculty association executive com-
mittee was suggested. The commit-
tee would decide upon outside
speakers who may appear on cam-
pus.

Dr. E. W. Jacobsen, dean of the
School of Education; Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfear, dean of men, and Thyrsa
W. Amos, dean of women, comprise
the committee considering the prob-
lem of political speakers.

No further action will be possible
until the deans meet on January 6.

Dr. Eugene A. Gilmore, dean of
the School of Law, reported that
nine graduate assistants are eligible
for conscription. The University
has informed the draft boards that
the instructors have begun their
academic year. 5 I

The 1941 Summer Session calen-
dar was discussed and established.

ODK Initiates Third Member
01" H olbrook Family at Banquet

Last night the third member of the Holbrook family to be inducted
into Gamma circle of Omicron Delta Kappa was initiated along with
eight other undergraduates, ﬁve faculty members, and two honorarv

Elmer A. Sll‘.

 

members at the fall initiation ban-
quet.

E. Allen Holbrook Jr., E41, fol-
lowed in the footsteps‘ of his‘ father,
Dean E. A. Holbrook of the Schools
of Engineering and Mines, and his
brother, John Holbrook, ’34, and
set a record for members of one
family initiated into the honorary.

Holbrook has been manager of
freshman camp for two years, is a
member of the baseball squad and
of Phi Gamma Delta. His brother,
John, was founder of the freshman
camp idea at Pitt, president for
three years of the YMCA, member

 

E. Allen Jr.

of Sigma Tau, Scabbard and Blade, and Phi Gamma Delta.

Dean Hol-

brook, a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, class of

1904, was also a member of Phi Gamma Delta.

John Holbrook became

an active member of ODK in 1933; Dean Holbrook was tapped as an

associate member after he became affiliated with the University.
Ceremonies at the twenty—fourth annual Founder’s day banquet were

held at the College club. Guest speaker was Dr. Andrey Avinoﬁ’, ad-

visory professor of biology and ﬁne arts. Cy

Lunden Gets Check
After Year’s Waitilig

Long-distance records for defer-
red payment were shattered last
week when Dr. Walter A. Lunden,
professor of sociology, received a
call from the Mellon bank.

Purpose of the call was to in-
form him of receipt of a check
which had been sent from the
bank in Stockholm, Sweden, in
payment for “Juvenile Crime,” an
article published in the Scandina-
vian Criminological Journal, De-
cember, 1939. He had forgotten
about the article.

The incident furnishes proof

"that Sweden has not yet been
pushed off the map and that dis-
ccuraged student writers should
take with ‘ light I -hea1ts*°six‘-*month-
delays in return manuscripts.

2 Days Remain
In Fund Drive

With reports still incomplete, the
University Community fund neared
its goal of $10,000 when money
pledged totaled $9,052.84, on Mon-
day. The drive has been extended
until this Friday.

Complete subscriptions are re-
ported only in the undergraduate
schools, which closed the campaign
two weeks ago with an intensive
two—day drive. The drive among
faculty members and students in the
professional schools has continued
simultaneously with the general city
campaign, and has been extended
one week, carrying the same dead-
line as the general drive.

Of Monday’s total, $6,714.85 has
been subscribed by the faculty. The
faculty quota has been set at $7,300
while $2,700 has been slated as the
student goal.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men and head of the student drive,
stated that he expected the student
quota of $2,700 to be reached when
the professional schools’ collection
is complete.

SFA Displays
Posters to Cut

Traffic Deaths

Glenn Heads Group
In Safety Campaign

\Vith the theme “Keep Life
Precious,” the parking commit-
tee of SFA, working in conjunc-
tion with the Better Traffic com-
mittee of the City of Pittsburgh,
this week swings into its poster
campaign in observance of safety
week.

A “deathless days” campaign will
be publicized. Object is to deter-
mine the number of days Pittsburgh
can go without a traffic fatality.

Under the chairmanship of Jack
Glenn, C41, the SFA parking com-
mittee will conﬁne its activities to
putting up posters in and around
campus buildings.

March of Time Movie

Several Pitt students, under the
direction of Roy H. Umble, in-
structor in speech, will participate
in a discussion on some phase of
safety week which will be broadcast
over station KQV on Friday even-
ing from 9:15 to 9:30 o’clock. Topic
of discussion and the students have
not yet been selected.

The safety week campaign on the
University campus will end with the
showing of a safety picture in the
March of Time at next Thursday’s
Essefay theater.

Glenn states that “With the full
cooperation of every University stu-
dent, we are certain to make this
the biggest and best safety cam-
paign week over sponsored by
SFA.”

Arouse Safety Feeling

The main object of the city-wide
campaign is, according to the Pitts-
burgh Better Traffic committee. “to
arouse individual safety conscious-
ness in an end-eavor to reduce the
accident toll in Pittsburgh.”

During the week, police have been

' instructed to intensify their enforce-

ment activities with special atten-
tion to drunken drivers and reck-
less motorists.

All community as well as down-
town stores, in addition to busses
and street cars throughout the city,
will display stickers, posters, and
other safety materials, as part of
the campaign.

Panther Exchanges Fur-piece
For Smock of llledical Clan

Since his junior year in the College, he has been leadin.g and mis-
leading sundry women and dogs by their respective arms and tails, around

the stadium at football games. V

Under guise of a 59-pound Panther suit (the head weighs in at 17)

he has been the attraction second-
ary only to the players at the games.
Sometimes he held the spotlight.

And Saturday before last the Pitt-
Penn State game marked his last
performance. For Amor Pierce.
Med4l, ﬁve feet four inches of en-
tertainment, has turned in his suit,
and has settled down to the more
serious business of learning how to
be a G. P., and we do mean general
practitioner!

“I’ve always gotten a kick out of
my role,” Amor declared, “in more
ways than one.”

He may have been referring to
one Fordham—Pitt game in which
the visiting team’s mascot, the well-
known ram, launched a rear-guard
attack on Amor.

His sense of balance, which often
kept spectators holding their breath
when he walked the narrow wall
separating the stadium seats from
the ﬁeld, was acquired in part from
the teaching of his mother, a former
ballet dancer.

“I’ve been working my way
through school by waiting on tables
in the University cafeteria and the
Faculty club,” Amor explained “I
also worked in a funeral parlor up
until last year.”

Now the University’s athletic de-
partment will have to select a stu-
dent to ﬁll Pierce’s suit.

The Panther is dead!
the Panther!

157 Frosh Women
Get Panther Pins

Over half the women in the class
of 1944 received gold merit panther
pins last week, according to Nancy
Crawford, C42, chairman of WSGA
customs committee.

The awards were presented to
157 freshman women in a class of
260. Eligibles included those stu-
dents who had maintained a quality
point average of at least 1.0, com-
plied with the customs require-
ments, cooperated in the mentor
program, passed customs examina-
tions, and shown true University
spirit.

Awarding of the merit panthers
completed the work of the customs
committee which has sponsored the
program for freshman orientation
beginning with Freshman week.

Court Resumes
Fireside Teas,

Informal Talks

Tomorrow afternoon the ﬁrst
in the regular series of Thursday
ﬁreside chats will be held in the
oﬁ’ice of Chancellor John G. Bow-
man, when a group of men and

women of the University student’

body gather for an informal get-
together in which the chancellor
and the students have an opportu-
nity to discuss subjects of mutual
interest.

Inaugurated by woman students
in the fall of 1938, this series is un-
der the sponsorship of the Senior
court of the Women’s Self-Govern-
ment association. This year, Har-
ri-ett Glasser, Ed41, who heads Sen-
ior court as chief justice, is in charge
of arrangements for the tea-time
meetings, which usually last from
3:30 until 5 o’clock.

Senior Court Serves

Invitations to attend these weekly
gatherings are issued by Senior
court through the office of the dean
of women. Men and women stu-
dents who are interested in attend-
ing are invited to leave their names
in the office of the dean of women,
twelfth ﬂoor, where invitations are
mailed as the student’s name is
reached on the list.

Hostesses for tomorrow’s ﬁreside
chat with the chancellor will be the
members of Senior court. They are:
Miss Glasser, Jane Ulrich, C; Betty
Springer, C: Gertrude Forman, Ed,
and Hulda Tully, C.

During the course of the discus-
sion tea is poured for Dr. Bowman
and his student guests, who gather
in front of the large ﬁreplace in
106 Cathedral, the office of the chan-
cell.or.

Discuss Current Problems.
Numerous requests from students
for an opportunity to meet Chan-

cellor Bowman and to discuss cur-

rent problems affecting students and
the University brought about the
establishment of the weekly in-
formal series of chats. They have
been held from the late fall through
the winter for the past two years,
and are being resumed this year.
The ﬁrst chat this year took place
several weeks ago on a Friday aft-
ernoon, but the regular series be-
gins with tomorrow’s meeting be-
tween the chancellor and the stu-
dents. .

Concerning the ﬁreside chats, Miss
Glasser says: “All students, both
men and women, are urged to sign
up for these chats which are in-
formal and frank and offer a chance
for the student to know the chan-
cellor better.”

Personal Education:
The Fireside Chat

IN A SCHOOL the size of ours, the oppor-
tunities for personal contact are not always as
great as we would like them to be.

Thus it is that we note with more than usual
interest the ﬁrst of Chancellor Bowman’s regu-
lar weekly ﬁreside chats tomorrow.

Democracy in this country began with the
open town meeting. Later, with increasing cen-
tralization of government and with the hyper-
normal growth of our population, face—to-face
contacts became near impossible. We embarked
upon the great age of representative, imper-
sonal government.

There has been, recently, a movement for
the return of the principles of the old town
meeting. The process is being streamlined.
Radio round-tables, conventions, letters to the
editors of the country are evidence of a grow-
ing interest of men in the affairs of man.

It would be physically impossible for the
Chancellor to meet every student in the Uni-
versity at these ﬁreside gatherings.

What is important is that some students will
meet with him, that there will be serious, low-
voiced discussion of those problems which are
vital to educators and educated.

This is the real manifestation of democracy
in an institution of learning. It may be inade-
quate, but it is a further step along the road
which the student must travel.

Not an Apology-em

A. Eteeapitulatien

PITT’S FOOTBALL TEAM ﬁnished its sea-
son Saturday, losing to Duke, 12-7. The loss gave
the local boys three wins, four losses, one tie, and
their ﬁrst sub-.500 season in 28 years.

On the surface, it would seem to have been
a poor Pitt team.

The facts don’t bear out such a contention.
Close analysis shows that only four yards stood
before a mediocre year and a thoroughly satis-
factory year. Three more yards would have
beaten Nebraska; instead the Huskers won . . .
and will spend a few days out West soon. One
yard would have beaten Duke; but the Blue
Devils won . . . and Pitt ﬁnished below .500.

The 1940 club was a good one; Pitt football
has not become second rate.

Next year’s schedule i_s [as difﬁcult as that
faced by any team in the country,'and the
chances are that the Panthers may not win more
than half their games. But if the 194.1 team can
match the 1940 eleven in thrilling football (for
further details see» the Missouri, SMU, Tech,
Nebraska, Penn State, and Duke games) there
will be no complaints from the cash customers.

Common
Sense

By Gerald Ziskind

The crucial test is drawing near. Herr Goebbels
is working overtime at his old tricks, employing in the
United States the same strategem and guile which
paved the way for collap:e of thirteen free European
governments. The scheme is a subtle pressure pro-
gram designed to weaken the moral ﬁber of the nation,
by undermining conviction in the eﬁicacy of democracy.

, Threats and cajolements are its weapons; lisping lures

and blandishments until, from sheer exhaustion, the
nation succumbs to insidious wiles, dragging down into
defeatism its traditional concepts of culture and decency.

We are now in the ﬁrst phase of the onslaught.
Already German agents crowd our manufacturing cen-
ters, ﬁle conﬁdential reports on our “progress,” and
promote connections with “friendly” ﬁnanciers and
businessmen. Already effort is made to arouse Ameri-
cans of German descent to support the “homeland.”
Already, in many industrial plants, mysterious accidents
occur, ranging from incidents causing temporary shut-
downs to the complete disruption of production by ﬁre
and explosion.

Clevah Nazis

These Nazis are clever. They know that patriotic
Americans will not willingly be duped into traitorous
acts.‘ Hence they make use of their ace card—-the fact
that large numbers of Germans, Czechs, Dutch, Poles,
and Frenchmen living in this country have relatives
abroad subject to Nazi rule. Herein the conniving
Nazis exercise a stranglehold upon thousands of our
people, admonishing them to “go along” or else face the
prospect that their relatives will be subjected to the
ghastly rigors of Nazi “discipline.”

In New York, for example, the editor of a widely-
circulated Czech newspaper is warned that his relatives
in Slovakia will be treated barbarously if he continues
his opposition to Nazi principles. Twice he has been
warned of the dire consequences of denouncing German
aggsession. Heedless and unafraid, he goes on print-
ing the truth as he sees it. But how many of our peo-
ple will hold out against such intimidation? How many
will say “No” in the face of threats?

Tinker to Evers to . . .

The Nazi plunderbund moves in devious ways its
chicanery to perform. They use other nations as tools
to execute their program. Thus Spain is employed as
the cultural motherland to influence the people of
Uruguay to refuse permission for our construction of
an air base there. The Franco newspaper Arriba im-
plores the Spanish—speaking people to beware of United
States “plutocracy” and “imperialism,” encouraging
Uruguayan college students and professional nationalists
to riot against “Yankee intervention.”

We are rapidly approach.ing the climax of the slick-
est, sl:/est, most ruthless battle in history. Secret as-
sassinations, veiled threats, the treacherous appeal to
emotional ties with the old world-——a1l these are weapons
of modern warfare. They are more lethal than the
most powerful howitzers, more alarming and challeng-
ing than the approach of an invading army.

M ore Tests

Ours is a country composed of all races, many of
which are closely bound by the appeals and aspirations
of the old world. The critical test of their steadfast-
ness to American ideals is now in the balance. This
turbulent era is a time of decision, when the foreign-
born, as well as those possessed of close kin abroad,
must make a terrible sacriﬁce, and with their own hands
cut the umbilical cord. Like the patriotic Czech editor,
they must renew and reassert their splendid contribu-
tions to the American experiment.

ing, and editing 50,000 items of his-
torical value weighing 600 pounds
is the task of Dr. Russell J. Fergu-
son, -associate professor of history.

All this materi.al deals with his-
tory of western Pennsylvania dur-
ing th-e period from 1792 to 1870.
The collection includes 18 boxes of
land. sale documents, 50 ledgers and
account books, diaries, railroad sur-
veys, one autobiographical account,
and 10,000 letters.

In his workshop on the third ﬂoor
of the Western Pennsylvania His-
torical society building, Bigelow
boulevard, Dr. Ferguson is editing
a..series of historical documents per-
taining to this region. His ﬁrst
manuscript, the revision of,-,J,ohn
Reyno1d’s autobiography, “My Con-
nection with the;Bui_1di_ng of the At-

lantic and Great Western Railway,”
will be ready for publication by the
ﬁrst of the year.

The ﬁrst survey of this railroad
enterprise appeared December 3,
1863. The Atlantic and Great West-
ern railway linked Jamestown, N.
Y., Meadville, Pa., and Dayton,
Ohio. Today it is a branch of the
Erie road. The surveys are valua-
ble in themselves, reveals Dr. Fer-
guson.

One of the most interesting diar-
ies is that of Tarleton Bates who
made his last entry in December,
1805,vbefore he was killed in a duel
near the present site of the Magee
hospital in January, 1806. Bates
was a politician, a quartermaster,
and ~ prothonatary of Allegheny
county. ~ - _

Dr. Ferguson has collected many
documents of the Northwestern

state bank. The establishment was
chartered in 1813 as the ﬁrst bank
north and west of Pittsburgh, and
liquidated in 1836. Minutes of
board meeting, stock lists, the char-
ter, and the items of liquidation top
the collection.

A valuable musty ledger of In-
dian transactions has been identi-
ﬁed as the property of a Venango
storekeeper. Old Cloud, Black
Chief, and Blind Snow, famous In-
dians of this region, trade with this
unknown merchant. .

During the War of 1.812, William
Hamliton kept a record of military
supplies transported from Fort La-
fayette to this territory. Saddles,
blankets, tents, ammunition and
clothing were sent to General Tan-
nehill of Meadville and to General
William Henry Harrison;-.who be-

p came the ninth president.

Sports Scribes
Finish Year’ s

Guessing

Many perplexing questions will
"be answered today when the Pitt
News prints the prognosticating rec-
ords of the sport staff yogis. Will
‘Tech be invited to the Rose Bowl?
Is it cooler in January or in the
country? I/Vho tackled Joe Thomp-
son? Better still, who is Joe Thomp-
:'SOl'l? These are just a few of the
questions that the records won’t
answer. But let the records speak.

Sports editor McElwain took an
-early lead in the “pick ’em or miss
’em league and kept it all through
‘the season. But a thirty-third de-
gree given to the rest of the sport
staff proved that they had been
‘sending representatives around the
country to ﬁx the games so that
“‘the- boss” would be easy to live
‘with.

Runner-up Chaﬁo, more than ﬁfty
‘points behind, is still running. He
doesn’t know that the football sea-
:son is over. Maxﬁeld did an about
face with the rest of the staff. Be-
ing a freshman, everyone ﬁgured
‘he would be green at the guessing
game. But after looking at his rec-
~ord, it’s the other experts who are
:green . . with envy.

Reinstein just couldn’t take it
"when he found out that he was
»only in fourth place. So he took a
--dive from the top of the Cathedral.
"On the way down, he dropped into
the eigth ﬂoor ofﬁce to predict that
Pitt would beat Fordham in ’42.
.Reinstein’s wrong again; that game
isn’t even scheduled.

When approached for a statement
concerning his successless season,
Alex Zelenski, the Charleroi kid,
asserted, “My record shows that I
':missed 24: games this year. A glance
at the football results proves con-
-clusively to me that there were ex-
zactly 24 upsets this year.”

Foote, Ripp, and Bazell are the
trio of boys bringing up the rear.
"They’re always bringing up some-
thing. Foote is still bringing up
that old one about picking Iowa
‘over Notre Dame. Ripp keeps
bringing his ouija board with him.
Bazell can bring up anything but
his average. Anyhow he didn’t pick

Jayvees Beat

Freshmen, I9-0

If the mathematical master-minds
who weekly dope out the results of
forthcoming football games to deal
‘with games like the freshman——
junior varsity football party of last
week, their prognosticating records
would take quite a beating.

For the 19-0 ﬁnal score that head-
ed the barren newspaper reports
bore little relation to the strength
‘of the two squads. There wasn’t a
"score in the ball game until the last
‘five minutes, when Jayvee fullback
Bob Malloy slammed through the
right side of the freshman line and

sprinted 40 yards to the 15» before‘

he was stopped. ‘Then Malloy, who
had been overshooting his mark by
inches with ‘bullet passes, ﬂoated a
wobbly toss to Sleber for the ‘touch-
down.

Two more scores followed in
quick succession, the ﬁrst following
a wild pass from center Jim

The Pitt News

Sports

I Man of the “=’eek

Since space limitations prevented the appearance of the Sports
Man of the Week last Wednesday, the News makes two awards today,
one for the Penn State game, one for the Duke game.

RALPH FIFE—If you’re looking
for topnotch guards, you needn’t go
further than the husky Canton,
Ohio, junior. Fife played his ﬁrst
game in the Washington opener last
year, and he's been going great ever
since. All during 1939 he subbed
for Hal Klein, but this year he
moved up to the ﬁrst string.

Through the ﬁrst four games, he
stood out in the Panther forward
wall, but got little notice. Then he
was shifted to a line-‘backing po-
sition for the Tech game with Steve
Sinco moving to defensive left
guard. The change made Pitt’s de-
fense. ’ ~

Ralph roamed all over the ﬁeld
in the ﬁnal four games, but also
showed up as a scoring threat
against Penn State. He took a lat-
eral from George Kracum for the
ﬁrst Pitt touchdown, later kicked
two extra points to take high scor-
ing honors for the day. If he con-
tinues to improve at his present
pace, he’ll be the best in the nation
next year.

ERNEST BONELLI—The
Devils stopped Bob Thurbon last
Saturday, but they couldn’t hold his

Blue

sub. “Dimp1es” finished off his col-
lege football career with his ﬁnest
performance in three years, and
almost turned a loss into a victory.
The Blawnox laughing boy never
advanced past third team as a soph-
omore right halfback, but last year
he started most of the Panther’s
games at fullback, the spot vacated
by the brilliant Marshall Goldberg.
This year Charley Bowser put
Ernie back at right halfback when
George Kracum came through.
The change gave Pitt a ﬁne pair
of righ.t halves in Thurbon and
Bonelli. With Thurbon out much
of the game, Ernie did a sparkling
job against Duke. He got away for
long gains several times, and made
two absolutely impossible catches.
Bonelli sparked Pitt’s fourth period
drive, and only when he stopped
carrying did the Panthers stall.

Pitt Stalls on One Yard Stripe;
Loses to Duke Blue Devils, 12-7

For the second time in three
weeks the Panthers had victory
within their grasp—against Nebras-
ka, the East’s Rose Bowl entry they
lacked three yards; against Duke
last Saturday it was one yard-—but
a courageous hard charging, Duke
line rose to the occasion and halted
the mad onslaught of the Pitt team
to win 12-7.

Before the latecomers had even
climbed into their seats, the Blue
Devils scored their touchdown on a
ﬂat pass from Wes McAfee to Steve
Lach. Tony Ruffa added the extra
point and Dixie eleven led, 7-0.

Until the beginning of the second
quarter, the Panthers could barely
get past their‘ own twenty, but on
the second play of the second quar-
ter, sophomore Jack Stctler grabbed
the pigskin, cut inside right end

While returning from the
Pitt-Duke weekend, two Uni-
versity students were injured
slightly, and five others shaken-
up when their car was struck by
an automobile speeding across
an intersection in the northern
city limits of Durham, N. C., late
Sunday morning.

Gene Tedick, C41, suffered a
badly bruised right leg, which
-at ﬁrst was fearred broken. Wil-
liam Jones, BA42, driver and"
owner of the car, sustained
bruised arms and lacerrations
around the eyes. “The “car, a
new 1941 convertible model, was
almost demolished,” Jones said.
Tedick said that the other 'car
sped through a {red light to cause
the accident. '-

point margin.

Ernie Bonelli, playing his last
contest in a Pitt uniform played the
greatest game of his career.
George Kracum was also his usual
brilliant self in his last Pitt en-
counter, but the Hazelton Husky
has one more collegiate game left,
the East-West shrine game in San
Francisco. 1

Picked to play in the North-
South encounter also, big George
decided to go West. The “dream
backﬁeld”. of all dream backﬁelds
should be performing for the East:
Kracum at fullback, Tommy.Har-
mon and Francis Reagan at u the
halfbacks with George Franck of
Minnesota in reserve, and Forest
Evashevski of Michigan to block.

Defending Champs Favored to Win

Again in Most Intramural Sports

By Alex Zelenski

With paddle tennis and badmin-
ton matches rapidly drawing to a
close, and cold weather forcing all
athletes indoors, the intramural de-
partment’s four sport winter pro-
gram will again be the topic of con-

‘versation in independent and fra-

ternity circles for the next three
months.

Last year’s winter schedule gave
the impetus to intramurals’ biggest
year with. the success due largely
to the interest found among inde-
pendent teams. The unattached stu-
dents won the all-campus bowling
crown, and threw many a scare into

. the fraternity basketball victor.

Basketball should again draw
the largest number of followers,
for its popu_lari‘Ly is well grounded
among the students. The Jerks, in-
dependent champs last year, will be
tagged as pro-season favorites. Their
starting lineup of Bonelli, Malloy,
Stetler, West, and Klotz will be
back for action. V

Phi.  winner of the I—F
dogﬁght, has only Jack Glenn and
Bob Tybcrski remaining. This year
an ex-champ should not mean so
much as in previous years, for the
strengthening of the opposition
suggests new titleholder.

Theta Chi looms as the possible
team to cop the fraternity baskeball

championship. Edgar Jones and
Bill Fitchko were the duct that al-
most brought the trophy to their
Dithridge dwelling last year, and
have a better than even chance to
bring home the goods this year.

Ping pong and Delta Tau Delta
are synonomous in fraternity
sports, but they rate no more than a
dark horse in this year’s play.

Rapping on the door of ping pong
fame, for the past three years have
been the University of Pittsburgh’s
number one and two men, Wally
Hirsch and Buddy Vvechsler. In
addition to these two artists, Phi
Epsilon Pi has Jimmy Deutelbaum.
Summing it all up, the Phi Eps have
the stronges. combination, and are
a deﬁnite title threat.

Delta Tau Delta lost the services

of Bill Hamilton‘ and Jimrny Ken-

nedy, and ‘with only Dan Cannon
and Harris Hawkins remaining
from their championship team, the
Delts seem to be in for a long hard
winter.

Bowling lost its top performer

this year  Pi Kappa Alpha’s Henry-
still,
made up of championship material,‘

DeRocher, but his team is
and should, barring unforeseen
happenings, emerge with the title.
Pi Lambda Phi’s ﬁve man team will

Sigiiificances
Of Italian Room

Presentation Planned

For Next Wednesday

The Italian room, which will
be presented to the University
next VVednesday by the SFA
Italian room committee, is, ac-
cording to Mrs. Ruth C. Mitchell,
adviser to the nationality rooms
project, “a symbolic manifestation
of the spirit of the Renaissance
combined with the ecclesiastic at-
mosphere of the Italian monasteries,
which kept alive classical knowl-
edge during the dark ages to in-
spire the rebirth of learning.”

The room itself is typical of an
Italian room of the early Renais-
sance period. It is large and roomy,
yet its design is subdued and re-
strained, with “the beauty of Ren-
aissance art blended with the sim-
plicity of early convents and mon-
asteries,” Mrs. Mitchell added.

Famous Names

On the dark brown hardwood
wainscoting are inscribed the names
of Italians who have made lasting
contributions to the world of art,
letters, and the sciences. Michel-
angelo, Da Vinci, Galileo, Marconi,
Columbus, and Dante are listed in
the room, states Mrs. Mitchell.

Inscribed on the backs of the
benches, which will be arranged in
a church-like seating plan, are the
names of famous Italian universi-
ties, including Bologna, the world’s
ﬁrst institution of higher learning,
and Padua, the ﬁrst university in
the world to admit women.

First Featuring Students

The ceiling, done in red and tur-
quoise, is a replica of the ceiling of
a medical monastery in Pesaro,
Italy, and the reading stand is a
copy of an altar in an Italian ca-
thedral.

“Carrying out the combination
of the spiritual with the worldly,”
explains Mrs. Mitchell, “is the
blackboard, which when closed re-
sembles the vestment closet of a
priest, the original of which was
found in an old Italian church.”

The original drawings for the
room were made by Ezio Cerpi,
Florentine architect, who is in
charge of all Italian restoration
work of historical sites. The ﬁnal
drawings and construction of the
room were supervised by Albert
Klimchek, University architect.

“The dedication of this room will
be the ﬁrst of these presentations
featuring student ceremonies,” Mrs.
Mitchell pointed out.

University, with the permission of
