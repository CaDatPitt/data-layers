Fund Drive
Faces Many

Obstacles

By MILO PONTE

(See Picture Page 7)

The Pitt Chest Fund Drive faces
a critical year with several ob-
stacles to be overcome.

Obstacle one: the large veteran
percentage of the student bofdy may
not have received that all-important
first check of the semester. The
checks are due on the first of the
month, but they often come late.

Obstacle two: many working stu-
dents are affected by the large
strikes in the area.

Obstacle three: at a recent meet-
ing of the Pitt Chest Council, fac-
- ulty members prescribed a method
of taking contributions in the spring

campaign which will consume no I

class time. .

The effects of these obstacles
place the drive in an unfortunate
dilemma. In the present drive, when
there is less potential money to
bring in, classroom time will be
utilized and a heavy publicity cam-
paign is in progress.

In the spring, when there may be
more money donated, no class time
can be taken. As a result, the drive
this year will consist of two cam-
paigns, but speakers will take con-
tributions in classrooms only in the
the fall campaign. .

Two separate drives were held
last year, one in the fall semester
and one in the spring. In both, con-

tributions were taken in the same*

way. Speakers introduced the sub-
ject in classes then distributed en-
velopes to contributors who could
either donate at that time or pledge
an amount to be turned in later at
the Student Desk. .

On Nov. 2, envelopes will be
given out again and students will
have the choice of contributingor
pledging. Instructions printed on the
envelope set the due date for pledges
as Thursday, Dec. 1, a month after
the drive.

In the spring semester, reminders
will be mailed out to all students
that contributions will be accepted
at the Student Desk. Pledges will
extend the contribution time until
March 1.

Chest committee members report
their campaign under full steam and
hope that the new arrangement for
collecting will not adversely affect
the drive. Chairman Bob Peary is
asking $2 from each student but re-
minds everyone that no contribution
is too small to help in reaching the
goal.

Homecoming

Plans Final

‘Should auld acquaintance be
forgot,’ it won't take long to renew
it when over five hundred alums
get together Saturday, Nov. 5, for
their first Homecoming buffet dinner
at the Hotel Schenley.

To aid in the renewing of old
acquaintances and the making of
new friends, Cy Hungerford, well
known Pittsburgh cartoonist, will
provide a cartoon ft: the lapel tags,
which hereafter will undcnbtedly
be prominently displayed among
alumni souvenir collections.

The innovation of the luncheon
this year was decided upon by the
Alumni Council as a more active
type of homecoming celebration for
a school with an alumni body the
size of Pitt’s.i It has been planned
as a buffet affair from 11 a.m. until
1:30 p.m. so that alums might leave
at any time to start the trek to the
Stadium for the proposed trouncing
of Ohio State by the Panthers. ,

This buffet luncheon is underthe
direction of William Kern, chairman”
of this fall’s homecoming activities.
Mr. Kern, a ’27 graduate of the
school of business, has coached
at Pitt, Carnegie Tech, and the
University of West Virginia.

The Court's outline of procedure

opportunity to hear the charges
against him, answer them, and ask
questions of the Court, according
to Joe Wolfe, supreme judge.

Simpson's antagonistic attitude
towards Pitt was expressed by his

just a factory.”]udge Wolfe seized
upon this remark to point out that
Pitt is “only a factory to those
who make it so,” and that it can
be much more to those who make it

AC rippling The Helping Ha

The axe may have been effectively and permanently applied
to complete student support of the dividending Pitt football for-
tunes--strangely enough,wielded by the students themselves. The
lack of interest displayed in the football team's important foray

to Philadelphia tomorrow forced a cancellation of the special-rate
game train.

From a daytime enrollment of some 16,000, only a few more
than a hundred were interested enough in the Panthers’ impending

game with undefeated Penn to take advantage of the special ex-

cursion trip arranged by Student Congress, under the leadership
of Don Ewart, and the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph.

Thefailure of this maiden venture, of recent years, into the
game train business means that school authorities will right
likely think twice, or more, before okaying such a plan in a future
which the athletic department and Pitt’s close followers have

reason to hope and believe will grow continually rosier.

Administration officials hesitated before approving the Uni-

versity tie-in with the promotion, remembering past failures of

“similar plans. However, with the Uniyersity population swollen

 much larger than at the time of earlier attempts, the student poc-
iiketbooks of today apparently no less flush, and faces bearing a
.victory-starved look, the idea appeared to have better than a

l/ongshot’s chance of hitting the 300-minimum wire in time.
The administration consented, a move it probably now regrets

and won’t forget. Ewart was a sad man Monday when he informed
'1 the’News his "baby” was through and the News wasn’t happy

about receiving the information.

1 Why did the students let the trip down? It’s hard to figure.
, The Indiana bubble-buster can’t take much of the blame. The
poor sales prior to the upset at Bloomington forced William F.
Saalbach, of the dean of men’s staff, to call off the special trip
Monday afternoon. The goal was not in sight and he wanted to
give, through the News, adequate warning to the meager number\
of ticket purchasers so they could get their refunds and change

their plans. 1 .

Of course, the unexpected defeat Saturday did have some in-
direct effect. Since there were bound to be quitters deserting the
winner as soon as it ran into trouble, it stood to reason that no
longer could a last-minute rush before the Wednesday deadline be
counted on. The longshot odds in this case were too long.

Other possible reasons? Maybe Joe Pitt’s wallet has become ‘
as buck-shy as those of Phillip Murray’s idle minions. Or ‘maybe
we’re confused when we think that the student body is, in general,
interested in the footballers.

Still the trip’s flop amounts to a rude back-turning on the

pathletes. The gridders can hardly count now on a boost from the

stands as they tackle Penn tomorrow.
Only the "driving” crowd and the band will be on hand. And

P if, in years to come,the football stock is bred into the blue-bloods
expected, the players can’t expect to be followed by a train-load

of rooting railbirds everywhere they go. University officials don’t
like to make a habit of going against their better judgment and
seeing the plan go astray.

One-Paragraph Wisdom

Report from "Indiana: When Indiana laced Pitt Saturday, it sent
the crowd into. ecstacyylt marked the Hoosiers’ first win in twelve
games, something recent history here doesn’t show. Yet when the
happy student body poured onto the field, they just paraded around
the gridiron. Note this, they didn’t touch their own goalposts. Pitt

Inquires

By BETTY MCGUIRE

While debate over assembly time
to celebrate football victories rags
in Student Congress, the opinions
of the students vary as much as
those of the legislators. These are
some of the answers we got when
we asked How We Should Celebrate
Football Victories.

Helen Crans and Erda Gottlieb,
College ’50: “No school!”

Jim Concelman, Bus. Ad. ’S0:
"A two hour rally at Soldiers and
Sailors is enough. We’re paying to
go to school so we only cheat our-
selves by not going to class.”

Ann Stinson, College '52: “We
shouldn’t take victoriestoo seri-
ously. We should just take them for
granted and expect them from the.
team unless we beat someone like
like Notre Dame.”

Jane Cunningham, Nursing ’50:
“Everybody should get together for
a big rally. It..would be a real treat
for us to be dismissed for even an
hour or two. We’ve never been able
to celebrate when everyone else did.

Tom Conway, College ’51: "We
should have long celebrations from
first hour to fifth hour with a day-
time bonfire, snake dance, and a
parade with the band. It should be
a mass rally in aplace where 10,000
students could attend. Four hours
is long enough because the pep dies
out about 12:30 p.m. and the drink-
ing starts. It would be better to go
to class than to a bar.”

Bill Copeland, Engineering ’51:
“There should be a big dance on
Saturday night. If it were up to me,
I’d take the whole week off.”

Mitzi Shapiro, College ’52: “One
hour isn’t enough, but the time
should be approved by the deans.
This mass hysteria that We" have
is unnecessary. Everyone should
turn up at pre-gamewrallys and blow
off steam at the games instead of
banging on classroom doors after
a victory.”

J0 Gallagher, College ’S2:“Ir’s
unfair to have only a half day off
because some students: get out of
all their classes and some don’t
get out of any. An organized rally
is better because sometimes a dis-
organized group carries things too
far and does real damage.”

Phil Artuso, Education ’50: "Cele-
brations should be carried to the
high schools too. This would im-
prove high school and university
relations and it might get me out
of student teaching at Peabody on
Monday morning.”

Wesley Dei Cas, Engineering '52:
“I think that everybody should be
dismissed for rallys including en-
gineers. No classes should be held
during the time allowed for the cele-
bration, not even automotive engin-
eering labs.” '

Madlyn Martucci, Education ’51:
"We should have rallys before games
instead of on Monday morning after
victories. The team should know
that we're for them before they play
instead of after they win.”

Letter To Ed

Editor
Pitt News

The addition of the new page,
"Campus Camera,” is a very excell-
ent idea.I am hoping this new page
of pictures will continue. It is in-
teresting to see students in action
from time to time.

I wish you and your staff success
in your new printing method. Look-
ing forward to more pictures” in the
future. John A. Abbruzzese, Jr.

 

 

“The Commons Room, located on
the first floor of the University, is
the center of the University life.
It is the meeting place for students
between classes and the scene of
University social affairs." -- Vade
Mecum, hand book for Pitt women,
1949-50, published by Womens’
Self Government Association.

Center of University life! Huh!
Name me some time of the day when
there aren't twice as many students
and faculty in the Tuck Shops and
the Faculty Club than there are in
the Commons Room, or an evening
when the Gold Bar can’t muster the
same ratio.

The biggest dance floor in town
is either right .under your feet or
right directly over your head, de-
pending on where you happen to be
reading this.

Only you can’: dance on it.

"Dance in the Commons Room?
Sacrilege!” shrills a chorus of
feminine voices from the first and
twelfth floors.

It seems that in the intervening
years since the Commons Room
was dedicated the half-acre en-
closure has been gradually but
relentlessly taken over by WSGA
and the Dean of Women’s office,
who ‘have strictly limited its use
to such annual affairs as Corona-
tion and the Pan-He llenic reception,
allowing the Chancellor to hold re-
ceptions there now and again, and
graciously permitting students to
gather and converse in hushed tones
during the day.

Yet Carnegie Tech has for years
held its Beaux Arts Ball among the
brooding busts of ancient Romans
in the Carnegie Museum outer gal-
lery. So has the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Society, whose patrons in-
clude ‘the cream
society.

of Pittsburgh’

aste   pace

   

" By DICK KOVAR

Pitt News Managing Editor

Sacrilege? Stuff and nonsense!

The opportunitiesfor making this
physical center of the University
the true center are limitless. Just
for example, picture an all-school
formal dance there.

Put the bandstand,complete with
name band, in the center of the
floor, be tween the two main columns
and halfway between the iron
gates and the Bigelow entrance.
Pay a crew time-and-a-half. to move
the large tables off the floor and
arrange the benches, chairs, and
smaller tables around the "walls,
with a punch table in one or both
of the rear wings.

Drape decorations from the bal-
conies. Pay marshals to close off
the stairs above the third floor.
Restrict smoking to the smoking
rooms and the two upper floors.
Sprinkle dance wax liberally over
the entire floor. Then start the
music.

If you don’t have the most ter-
rific, yet least expensive, dance
this campus has seen in years, I’ll
clean up that dancewax with my
tongue. If you do, the same crew
that set up the place can put it
back in order. For that matter, a
dance committee with a spread like
that would be willing to do it them-
selves. Either way, you’ve got a
high-class, low-cost dance.

More than that, you’ll find stu-
dents coming to think of the Com-
mons Room as the place it was
intended to be—-the true heart of the
University of Pittsburgh.

Take a walk through the Commons
Room today, or better yet, late
this afternoon or evening. Look
around the place. Hum "Stardus‘t”
and slide your feet a little. Nice,

.'huh? Wouldn’t a Christmas formal

be terrific there, with evergreens
all over the place and the fire-
places roaring? Dambetcha.

Research ureau Marks
Silver Anniversary

If bureaus celebrated anniversaries, there would be a big cake
with twenty-five candles, up in the office of the Bureau of Busi-

ness Research.

The twenty-five candles would represent the Bureau’s quarter»
century of service to the Pittsburgh district.

The Bureau was established
facilitate studies in business and
economics. For five years it strug-
gled in comparative poverty to for-
ward its work.

Then in 1929 the Bureau got the
boost it needed. The Buhl Founda-
tion set up a fund to aid the youth-
fu_l organization in an eight-year
program of regional studies. Chan-
cellor Bowman recognized that the
Bureau of Business Research was
here to stay. With his recommend-
ation the University trustees made
it a coordinate division of the Uni-
versity in 1931.

Dr. J.P. Watson has headed the
Bureau since 1942.

Frosh Meet
Ohio U.‘
Tomorrow

The Pitt frosh will make their
second and final grid appearance
at the" Stadium tomorrow when they
meet the Ohio University freshmen
at 2 o’clock.

Coach Ted Schmitt will send the
same lineup against Ohio as he
used to defeat Washingtcn and Jef-
ferson, 20-0, last Saturday with one
exception.

Tony Romantino, who fractured
his leg last week in a practice with
the varsity will be out for the re-
mainder of the season.Frank D<iLe0
will take his place in the starting
lineup.

The fresh coach stressed pass
protection and surer blocking in
practice this week. Insufficient
protection for the passers gave the
frosh a grand total of one completed
pass in last week's game. ,

Ohio University brings to the
Stadium the same type of offensive
that the Prexies used last Saturday,
a T-formation varied with the sin-
gle wing. Frank Richey, the Fight-
ing Bobcat's coach, has a fast squad.

-‘This year's team,’ Richey said,
‘has greater speed than our 1948
squad which won three out of its
four contests.’

The Ohioans, like the Panthers,
have only played one game this
season. The Bobcats were defeated
by the Cincinatti frosh, 38-13.

Richey’s chief worry this year
is the lack of adequate replace-

ments for his first and second
stringers.
As for Pitt, reserve strength

seems to have become a surprise
factor. While the first" two teams
were knocking heads with the var-
sity, the third and fourth string,
guickzd by Don Fisher and John
Kosh, gave the Junior Varsity a
rough time in a battle at Ellsworth.

Admittance to the game will be

.the same as‘ before--student acti-

vity cards or 50‘cents for outsiders.

Olsonis Harriers Engage

B3’ SAM SPATTEh

Carl Olson and his predominantly
sophomore country squad departed
early this morning for their Satur-
day quadrangular meet at Van Court-
landt Park, N. Y., with Army, Col-
umbia, and Pennsylvania.

The meet is almost certain to
provide the Panthers with their
stiffest test yet. Until now, they
have clashed with no‘name’ schools.

The Panther harriers, flushed by
consecutive victories over West-
minister and Geneva in a triangular
meet and Western Reserve in a dual
meet, will be taking their first trip
of the season. All previous Pitt
meets have been held at Schenley
Park.

Only three of the seven local
thinclads have previously ran at
Van Courtlandt. This trio consists
of Jay Neilson, Ted Zatkovich and
John "Red” Weigel, all last year
varsityman. The remaining members,
all sophomores, are Frank Kuzma,
Ed Berman, Jack McMahon, and Ken
Mahanna. '

Pitt’s hopes will rest on the

Both Kuzma and Neilson, who
was second last Saturday, were

Bob Bruecken, who scored twice

aroundand threw a short touchdown
pass to Jim Wall in the end zone
late in the third quarter.

Not to be outdone by his brother,

mage at least twice a week as usual.

Notwithstanding criticism from
some quarters that the gridders are
overworked, this week's sessions

those of preced-e

In answer to queries, Milligan
asserted, “The players were de-
finitely not overworked. They didn’t
scrimmage more last week than they
usually do.”

Scrimmages for the first and sec-
ond elevens are usually scheduled
for Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The
players with slight injuries from
the preceding Saturday’s game are
rested and do not participate.

Last week, the third string, in
addition to body contact drills on
Tuesday and Wednesday, scrim-
maged Thursday.

"Since they haven’t had a chance
_to play in any of the previous Sat-

cause of a track injury, and Red
Bagnell, ex—Quaker water boy, have
sparkled all year long with their
passing and running from the tail-
back slot.

Munger has keptDeuber and Bag-
nell on their toes all season long
by keeping the starting tailback
post a question mark up until game
time. One, week it’s Deuber and the
next Bagnell, with both delivering
the goods when they are called
upon.

Other wheels in the backfield
are Co-captain fullback Ray Dooney,
the flying fireplug, Wingback Bill
Rhoads, a 9.8 dasher in the cen-

tury, and Dave Coulson, a defensive V

halfback last season but now at
quarterback.

Line Surprises

The line that was supposed to be
weak without the presence of Chuck
Bednarik has shown surprising
strength this fall.

Penn’s forward wall has given
up the average of only one TD per
game. And though weak in reserves,
it has two possible All-Americans
in Guard Bernie Lemonick and End
Herb Agocs.

Much of the credit for the fine
play of the Quaker defense has to
go to Snakey Bob Graham. Graham
replaces Dooney at fullback on de-
fense and he has developed into a
fine line backer.

Pitt’s visit to Philadelphia this
week will be the first appearance
of a Panther eleven in Franklin
Field since 1932.

night last week. "We did stay until
7 a couple of nights, though,” he
said. However, he pointed out that
although drills are scheduled for
4:30, it’s close to five o’clock be-
fore they get underway.

Taking advantage of the presence
of the frosh team last week, Milli-
gan scrimmaged the squad with of-
fense being stressed. With Ted
Schmitt’s freshmen eleven back
again this week, the emphasis was
on defense. Schmitt’s yearlings
ran Penn’s single wing in a manner
that didn’t baffle the spirited var-
sity.

Schmitt, who scouted Penn last
week, said that Ray Dooney, Quaker
line-denter, would probably be the
best fullback the Panthers would
run into this year.

500 Students Missing;

Registrar in Dilemma

The registrar’s office has to keep track of 21,000 students
scattered in all directions from the Cathedral; and it appears that
about 500 of them are not where they should be. . .

According to Assistant Registrar E. A. Batchelder, his office
mailed out some 17,000 pre-registration kits during the month of
August. Of these, 500 were returned to the registrar’s office be-

Editor Reiterates
Owl Photo Plan

Undergraduate, students are once
more reminded that they can have
their pictures in the Owl yearbook
merely by subscribing to it.

According to Editor Renee Fried-
man, the new Owl will have, in ad-
dition to student portraits, familiar
photographs of the campus, the
Commons Room, class rooms, and
many phases of student life.

Subscriptions to the Owl will be
taken at the Student Desk on the
ground floor.

Rally Letter

(Cont. from’Page 1)

The free time schedule calls for
two pep rallies, the fourth period
on Nov. 4, preceding the Ohio State
game and from 12:30 to 1:30 on Fri-
day before the Penn State game,
with the third hour to be used for
a victory celebration.

Extra lIour Allowed’

The deans’ proposal also stipu-
lated that if the first “upset” de-
monstration, such as the one fol-
lowing the Northwestern rally, were
a success, an additional hour would
be granted for a future celebration.

The letter continued that Ells-
worth Center students would not be
able to participate in a hour rally
‘due to the time necessary to reach
and return from the building.

Maher, in the program outlined
in the letter, suggested dismissals
at 9:30 a.m. to be followed by a
‘pep rally in Memorial Hall opened
by the band, with short addresses
by student and faculty leaders and
the honoring of the coaches and
team.

The second hour would have been
taken up with a march behind the
band and short cheer session at
A Ellsworth Center and then a return
parade to the campus for disbanding.

Traffic Detour Refused

Because of heavy use at that
time in the morning, the Traffic
Commission would not give its
approval to detouring traffic from
Bayard Street, Fox insisted.

Greenberger stated that the Traf-
fic Commission would naturally re-
fuse, to make its job easier.

"The parade comes under the
classification of ‘Act of G0d’,"
Don Ewart said, “and just as the
Ohio State rally two years ago

the Traffic Commission.

“Student Congress cannot hold
itself responsible for controlling
the student enthusiasm which will
naturally follow a victory, especi-
ally in the light of last week's
football setback,” the letter con-
cluded.

Biddle ‘Praises Deans

Theodore Biddle, dean of men,
said the deans have done more for
the students" this year than ever be-
fore by granting students six hours
of class cuts.

Heads Discussion

Dr. Albert Martin, assistant pro-
fessor of Political Science, will
head a "UN Round Table Discus-
sion” on Friday, Oct. 28, at the
Braun Room, twelfth floor.

He will speak before the members
of the YWCA, most of whom, have
recently returned from a visit to
the UN Assembly.

Dr. Martin intends to point out
the historical value of Bulgaria
and Rumania that will tie up the
immediate question that was be-
hind the UN action on Monday. The
question of the
Korea will also be discussed.

Mrs. Edna T. Batz, director of
YWCA, feels that this discussion
will provide the Tfiembers with the
necessary background needed to
understand more clearly the func-

tions and powers of the UN.

cause of faulty address.

Mr. Batchelder adds that our
office is trying to accomplish a
certain job and at the same time
be of service to the individual stu-
dent,” he said, “we cannot mail
out the proper material at the right ‘
time if the student has given us
the wrong address or moved and
not notified us.” A »

He suggests as a moral to his
report that any student who moves

(1

should at once pick up a change-of- , ii

address card at the registrar's office
and fill in the new information. His
office will channel the address

change to all interested departments ’

of the University.
During the early part of the pre-
sent semester a great volume of

cumulative grade reports were mail- .

ed out with the same margin of error.
It is expected that by the time all
errant reports have been returned
to the University the total will
again reach about 500.

The registrar is still working on
a backlog of these grade reports.
Many students have yet to receive .
their first one. A

Mr. Batchelder hopes to put the I
the issuing of cumulative reports,
on a semester basis following each

registration. At present they are
issued yearly.
Already looking towards the

spring registration, Mr. Batchelder
expects to set the wheels in motion
within the next six weeks to pour 7
16,000 pre-registration kits into
the mail.
