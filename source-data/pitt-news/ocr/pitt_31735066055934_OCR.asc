Professor interests young
girls in science careers

Penelope Taylor
For The Pitt News

Janet Montelaro is pioneer-
ing in Wexford, spearheading
a project to heighten girls’
awareness of career possibili-
ties in math and science.
Judging from recent studies of
female achievements in these
areas, this may prove every bit
as challenging as keeping
house in a Conestoga wagon.

Montelaro,’ a Research’

Assistant Professor in Pitt’s
Women’s Studies Program,
used her connections with the
faculty of Marshall
Elementary School to set up
an after—school program aimed
at fourth— and f1fth—grade girls.

Montelaro states that girls’
interest in science is peaking
at this age, but that negative
cultural expectations and bias

Greeks get newrules, aclvisors

_Cesca Antonelli
News Editor

Pitt has adopted a number of recommendations
that will revamp much of Greek life, including
pledging, Greek academic standing and the battle
against alcohol abuse.

The actions, submitted by a Greek Imperative
Committee headed by director of student activities
Joe Cavella and adopted by Vice Chancellor for
Student and Public Affairs Leon Haley, will begin
in the fall as a response to scrutiny of fraternities at
Pitt and nationwide.

“The plan is designed to strengthen the Greek
system by holding it to a higher standard of respon-
sibility and accountability,” Haley said.

Members of the Inter-Fraternity Council were not
available to comment on the new policies.

Haley cited the recent hazing incidents at three
Pitt fraternities, Phi Kappa Theta, Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Kappa Alpha Psi, as a reason for the
increased regulation of the Greek system. In addi-
tion to the recent suspensions due to hazing, Pitt
fraternities have come under ﬁre in the past year for
the recent drug bust at Pi Lambda Phi that resulted
in eight arrests and the expulsion of the Zeta Beta
Tau fraternity after three new members took pic-
tures of women in the shower stalls in the Towers.

“Given [all the policy violations by Pitt fratemi—
ties last year], we believe it is most appropriate,”
Haley said. “We carmot go into another year having
done nothing about it.” _ - . .

The actions in the works include stronger mea-
sures against alcohol abuse and hazing, as well as
making f1rst—semester freshmen ineligible for new
member rush.

“Experience indicates most freshmen are in sig-
nificant transitions from high school to college,”
Haley said. “This gives them time to mature and to
get acclimated to make the best decision.”

Haley also said that the burdens of pledging usu-
ally result in a drop in the pledges’ academic stud-
ies, and they create academic diﬂiculties.

Other actions will provide greater in-house super-
vision’ by placing a new Graduate Student Assistant

in the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity house. This assistant
will have “live-in” residence there and will assist
the Greek Advisor, Keny Daley, in aiding all chap-
ters’ developments and prograrmnings. Haley said
that the provision in Pi Kappa Phi’s housing
arrangement, which began after the decision to give
the fraternity Zeta Beta Tau’s lease, includes
accommodations for the Assistant.

The actions also strengthen current alcohol moni-
toring practices at Greek events. Haley said that
alcohol policies were being reviewed in order to
eliminate “loopholes” which have allowed alcohol
abuse to take place.

“We need to take a close look, step by step, of
alcohol policies at social events,” Haley said.

In addition to tighter monitoring policies, the new
actions will require that all fratemity members serv-
ing as bartenders at fraternity events be 21 and par-
take in a training program. Haley said that some
fraternities already have such policies, but that the
new actions would make the policy mandatory.

The new actions will also standardize “bring your
own bottle” policies by limiting the amount of alco-
hol any one member can bring to an event to ensure
that the member bringing the alcohol is the only
one drinking it.

The policies also include extensive anti—hazing
programs, including the insertion of a standard anti-
hazing clause into each fraternity’s new member
orientation program and the elimination of “I-
wee ” and “Hell Week,” two traditional practices
that fraternities have used to subject pledges to
abuse.

In addition to new anti—hazing practices, a‘ divi-
sion of Student Affairs headed by Daley is explor-
ing the possibility of setting up a “Hazing Hotline.”

“[This hotline is] an opportunity for a person in
new member orientation, if he feels something may
be going on bordering on hazing, to call and find
out what it is and, more importantly, what he can do
about it,” Haley said.

The new actions would also require that each ﬁa-
ternity maintain an overall QPA equal to the overall
male average at the University or be put on proba-
tion for either six months or until the next report

Temp expert says to wait for
early birds to leave their iobs

19§6’ 3

Staff Wiiter

Despite popular belief, the
early bird doesn’t always get the
job. This is especially true for
temporary jobs, which many col-
lege students use for summer
employment, according to The
Skills Bureau in Boston.

Sandy Poritzky, the Bureau’s
president, said that it doesn’t take
a “rocket scientist” to ﬁgure out
why.

“Every college student in the
country hits the job market
between May and June,” Poritzky
said. “Most of them only want to
work for two to three months and
then take a vacation before
returning to schoo .”

In Poritzky’s opinion, this rush
of summer applicants produces
two problematic results. First,
there are too many applicants at
the beginning of the summer.

Since there aren’t enough quality
temporary jobs to go around,
many people have a hard time
ﬁnding employment.

The second result Poritzky
cited is that due to this overpopu-
lation of temporary agencies,
when a student does ﬁnd work, it
is for lower pay. The law of sup-
ply and demand depresses the
pay rates.

However, Poritzky, a 30-year
veteran of the temporary busi-
ness, said that starting in the mid-
dle of July and continuing
through the end of the summer,
most college students want to
take a vacation before returning
to school. During these months,

many families also take their .

vacations before their children
return to school. This means
fewer applicants for a greater
number of jobs and many more
temp opportunities.

Mental health crisis team makes house calls

Russ Krebs
Staﬁ’ Writer

A few more children and teens will
sleep in their homes tonight, rather than
in psychiatric hospitals or state mental
health facilities, due to a program for
youths with psychiatric and emotional
problems offered through the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

This program, called the Child and
Adolescent Chronic—disorders
Treatment Intervention Service (CAC-
TIS), provides crisis intervention ser-
vices for Allegheny County youths who
are living at home and have had one or
more psychiatric hospitalizations or
have been placed in state institutions in
the past year.

g CACTIS is funded by the Allegheny
County Mental Health/Mental

Retardation/Drug and
Alcohol/Homeless and Hunger pro-
grams.

“Our program is the only program in

p the state that deals speciﬁcally with chil-
dren,” said Angel Landﬁied, a Mental

Health Crisis Specialist in the CACTIS

— program. “CACTIS deals mostly with

children between the ages of four and

'18, although We have had older patients

with special circumstances.”

CACTIS mobile teams are available
to families in need of help 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. There are peo-
ple in the omce
to answer the

children out of the hospital. With this
program, they can help themselves by

calling when they feel they need help,” '

said Landfried.

The therapist then assesses the possi-
ble level of danger to the family or
child. Depending on the danger level,
the decision is
made whether the

phones and “The goal Of  IS t0 team should come

questions from
8 a.m. until
10:30 p.m.
During off
hours, families
can use the
office paging ‘
system.

Each CAC-
TIS team con-
sists of two therapists with bachelor’s or
master’s degrees. In addition to their
degrees, these therapists are specially
trained in crisis intervention.

A typical visit starts off with a call
from either'a family member or the
child himself. Usually these calls are
made due tossome sort of family con-
ﬂict. '

“The goal of our program is to keep

keep families together by
breaking this vicious
cycle.”

- Oscar Burstein, medical director

out or not. The
caller is also asked
his opinion on
whether or not the
situation needs on-
site care.
According to
Landfried, in
many cases, the
situation can be
handled over the phone.

If it is detennined that an on—site visit
is necessary, the team goes to the resi-
dence. Once there, one therapist general-
ly speaks with the child and the other
with the family. This approach, howev-
er, depends on the situation, and the
child and family are sometimes brought
together to talk.

Once the therapists understand what

has happened, they try to ﬁnd out what
led to the problem. They attempt to ﬁnd
a solution and to ﬁgure out what can be
done differently the next time the situa-
tion occurs.

“Anger management is one of our
biggest concerns,” Landfried said about
their attempts to make a plan for next
time. A h

The team then works with the child
and family to identify a consequence for
the child’s behavior and stays until the
consequence is completed. Once the
team feels that calmness has been
achieved and the family is safe, its job at
the home is complete.

Even though the job at the home is '

ﬁnished, the team is not done with its
work. Team members must call the
child’s therapist and update him on the
situation as soon as possible. A written

summary is made and sent to the thera— ‘

pist as well.

Dr. Oscar Burstein, medical director
for CACTIS, said, “Episodes at home or
school often result in repeat hospitaliza-
tions for these youths, exacerbating their
conditions more and more. The goal of
CACTIS is to keep families together by
breaking this vicious cycle.”

are the main culprits when this
interest begins to wane.

Myra and David Sadker,
authors of “Failing at Fairness:
How America’s Schools Cheat
Girls,” note that while girls’
academic achievements in ele-
mentary school outrank those
of boys, this pattern reverses
with the start of middle school.

“As a group, women are the
only students who actually lose
ground the longer they stay in
school,” the Sadkers said in a
recent article.

Can one assume, then, that
the onset of puberty actually
improves the male brain, while
degrading its female counter-
part? No, says Montelaro.
She believes that the reasons
for dropping grades, waning
interest, and the eventual under-
representation of women in sci-
ence and math careers is multi-
faceted. She cites the socializa-
tion process of middle school
and the deep—seated cultural
biases which lead even enlight-
ened faculty to encourage boys
more, to spend more time
teaching boys, and to include
more boys in demonstrations
and experiments. » '

Montelaro said that the pro
gram helps to overcome those
difficulties‘ by highlighting dif-
ferent women in scientific
careers by inviting them to dis-
cuss their work and provide
hands-on demonstrations for
female students.

Last week, Christine Renk, a
Bayer Corporation scientist,
showed Marshall Elementary
girls how to make “Gak” from
Elmer’s Glue, water, and a
borax solution. The idea is to
stimulate their interest in going
into the laboratory to pursue
scientific endeavors. Perhaps
even more importantly, the pur-
pose is to simply plant the seed
of the basic idea that girls can
go into the lab to find answers
through the methodology of
science.

According to Montelaro, the
idea of professional women sci-
entists teaching pre-adolescent
girls by demonstration and per-
sonal example is an idea that
has come of age.

PA-land of cheap slogans

“Pennsylvania Memories Last a Lifetime.”

It sounds a bit corny, but it must be true. After all,
Governor Tom Ridge unveiled this heartfelt sentiment last
week as Pennsylvania’s new slogan. And he certainly
wouldn’t be spending $3.4 million on an advertising cam-
paign if its catch phrase weren’t true.

Yes, $3.4 million. Does that sound like a lot of money to
be spending on a sound bite to attract tourists? State
Representative Tony DeLuca, for one, thinks so: “Those
millions could be better spent educating our children, ﬁx-
ing our roads, feeding our hungy citizens —' anything but
buying a new slogan for the Commonwealt .”

That $3.4 million is made even more ironic in light of the
fact that “Memories Last a Lifetime” is also the slogan of a
strip joint in York, PA —' an establishment whose owner
came up with his slogan while having a cup of coffee.

Factor in the price of that coffee, and the cost of the slogan .

was 89 cents.
All things considered, the editorial board of The Pitt
News feels that Gov. Ridge could have saved the state a

7 bundle of money by simply coming to us for a slogan.

Here are a whole slew of snappy phrases that sum up
Pennsylvania’s unique personality at least as well as
“Pennsylvania Memories Last a Lifetime”:

- “Pennsylvania — Our Roads Have More Holes Than
Swiss Cheese”

0 “Pennsylvania — Leading the Nation in Nuclear
Meltdowns Since 1979”

- “Pennsylvania Medical Bills Last a Lifetime”

- “Pennsylvania — Yinz Come With?”

0 “Pennsylvania — We’re Crazy Mennonites”

0 “Every Day is Gray Here in PA”

0 “Pennsylvania - LA Cops Have Nothing On Ours”

- “Pennsylvania — One of America’s Great States, Or
Something”

- “Pennsylvania — We Never Wanted Philadelphia To Be
the N ation’s Stupid O1’ Capital Anyway”

0 “Pennsylvania — Ridge Needs Slapped”

- “Pennsylvania — Philly On the Right, Da Burgh On the
Left, and Lots'a Hills In Between” _

0 “No Fun Being Gay In PA” '

- “Pennsylvania — Where Keystone Beer Got the Name”

- “Pennsylvania — We Can’t Pronounce ‘Kielbossi”’

- “If You Liked The Old Country, You’ll Love
Pennsylvania!”

See? Over a dozen slogans that didn’t cost a dime. Alas,

it’s too late to save our tax dollars on this one. But maybe ,

when Pitt’s new chancellor decides that “Transforming the
Present — Discovering the Future” isn’t a snappy enough
motto for Pitt, she (or he — anything’s possible) will know
where to turn. '

Last week, the Chief of Naval
Operations, Admiral Jeremy M.
Boorda, committed suicide. The
reasons that have been given for
his suicide revolve around the
fact that he wore two bronze Vs
on his ribbons which he may or

wear.

These little bronze letters indi-
cate that the wearer earned them
in combat service. Admiral
Boorda’s right to wear these dec-
orations was going to be ques-
tioned in an upcoming magazine
article. So, according to the
accounts coming from
Washington, the admiral shot
himself rather than put the navy
through another scandal.

While those of us on the out-
side smell a rat and say there
must be more to this, a columnist
for the New York Times and ex-
Marine Corps General says that
Boorda took his life because of
the question of honor. He paints
Boorda as some sort of samurai
committing hara-kiri over this
incident.

If this account is true, and the
little letters on ribbons are the
only reason Boorda committed
suicide, then this reveals a serious
problem. It reveals the extent to
which people are now caught up
in symbolism and imagery. The
fact of the matter is, if the navy
under Admiral Boorda’s com-
mand was effective at doing its
job and he was a good comman-
der strategically, then the ribbons
are immaterial. In fact, Boorda
has probably seen more than his
share of combat in dealing with
the politics inside of the navy and
in Washington.

In order to spare any military
personnel who may be of a dif-
ferent opinion the cost of a stamp
to mail a letter, the point of this is
not to denigrate the men and
women who have actually served
in combat. Rather, what I’m try-

l’LaTFoKM

/

ing to say goes a lot deeper than
that.

Back near the beginning of this
nation, the founding fathers were
reluctant to approve any sort of
medal because it was too reminis-
cent of the heraldry of Europe
and its aristocracy. The Purple
Heart was the first medal
approved because it was thought

. that those who had been_wound-

ed in the defense or offense of

this country deserved some’

recognition. They recognized the
danger of symbolism taken to
extreme.

Since then, the number of
medals has grown tremendously.
Not only are they given for vari-
ous campaigns and combat
actions, they are also given for
qualiﬁcations, so that is is nearly
possible to wear one’s personnel

ﬁle on one’s chest. A friend in the ‘

navy sent me a letter in which he
said that he would receive one
medal for being on ship off the
coast of Bosnia, one for being
part of a unit that ﬁred missiles
into Bosnia, and yet another just
for the unit’s effectiveness.

There is also a connection
between the concern over uni-
forms and medals and the actual
military success of the army. The
axiom goes something like: the
more concerned an army is with
its appearance, the less effective
they are in actual combat. Gen.
William C. Westrnoreland’s fond-
ness for uniforms and badges
goes back to his Cub Scout days.
The American Army was called
one of the best-dressed in the
world, and they did not do so
well. Also, the French are very
found of ﬂashy uniforms. Their
success record is not stellar.

Beyond the strictly military
realm, however, there is a sort of
paralysis that sets in when people
begin to sort out the symbols
from fact. Americans often
become literally starry-eyed over
the accoutrements of the country.

Very often, people are unable
to explain the symbols that they

are looking at; The American

Flag is easy, but how about the

symbolism on a dollar bill. There I

is a lot of American and other
symbolism there, and it is worth
knowing.

The best example of this is the
American flag versus the
Constitution. While ﬂag burning
might not be the best thing in the
world for someone who is dissat-
isﬁed with the country to do (vot-
ing is much better), it is better to
allow a nut to burn the ﬂag than a
fascist to burn the Constitution.
The ﬂag is a symbol of the free-
doms protected by the
Constitution. It is important to
make the distinction between
what truly needs protection and
what is able to be sacrificed
because its loss is really a gain.

Ribbons and ﬂags are symbols.
When the symbols replace their
actual meanings, then we have
lost sight of the truth and are sub-
ject to manipulation by dema-
goguery.

The question, then, is more
than that of whether or not the
Admiral ought to have been
allowed to have letters pirmed to
his ribbons. The question
becomes one of whether those
bits of bronze should have
become so important that he
wanted them -—- even not having
earned them — and that the dis-
closure that he was not allowed to
wear them should have cost him
his life. In light of the fact that he
rose in the ranks from an enlisted
man to the top of the navy, and
the fact that he was an able com-
mander working for the good of
his men, it seems that he
shouldn’t have felt the need to
have those pins at all. Beyond
this, that he had the pins and
ought not to have seems irrele-
vant or at least not a capital
offense. This incident should
serve as a warning to all of us to
beware of the power and impor-
tance we attribute to symbols.

Strange circumstances

  The latest
imbroglio

over U.S.
male
gymnasts

 

Columnist

_train

his ' month’s
Olympic imbroglio
is over the US

men’s gymnastics team’s
decision " regarding
whether the team should
in Spartanburg,
South Carolina. The
Spartanburg County
Council recently voted to
condemn homosexuality
as a “lifestyle.”

USA gymnastics should
decide not to train in
Spartanburg a week
before the team moves to
Atlanta. The decision will
generate debate now, but
when July arrives, the
press will be back on
track talking about the
sport, not the politics.

This event impacts
gymnastics because it
uses up the small amount
of press coverage that
men’s gymnastics, a sport
facing extinction in the
US, will receive. USA
gymnastics needs cover-
age of the sport, not the
scandals. '

Male gymnasts peak

zaround college age. Yet
,the_ NCAA is considering
‘ dropping the sport alto-

gether. The Olympics is a
time for men’s gymnas-
tics to rally support and
recruit young athletes.
The Olympics is not a

. time for conservatives to

draw a line in the sand
for an ongoing political
debate which will contin-
ue long after the last
Olympic tourist has left
Atlanta. ’

Headlines about men’s
gymnastics should be
about the athletes and the
fact that Men’s Health
and Fitness Magazine
just ranked gymnastics at
of the most difficult
sports.

Assistant Sports Editor

After closing out the 1995-
1996 season a disappointing
10-17, the Pitt men’s basket-
ball team was faced with the
task of yet another off-sea-
son of rebuilding. So far, the
off-season hasn’t been pleas-

ant for the Panthers.

In the first week of May,
head coach Ralph Willard
lost one of the five freshman
thought by many to be the
foundation of basketball at
Pitt for the next four years in

Michael Gill. The 6-foot-5, '

200-pound forward from
Washington, D.C. averaged
3.4 points and 1.7 rebounds
in his first and last year as a
Panther.

Coming out of famed-

Dunbar High School in
Washington, Gill was the
nation’s capital player of the
year in 1995 and came to
Pitt, bringing with him the
high expectations of many
basketball critics. These
turned out to be just part‘ of

what forced Gill to head out

of_ the Steel City for good
after finals.

“Michael’s transition
wasn’t very smooth coming
to Pitt. There were a lot of
things that really got him
down during the year,”
Panther assistant coach

Bobby Jones said. “The
groin injury early in the year
hampered _him, and his
grandmother passed away
around-Christmas. It was just
a series of things that kept
him out of practice, and he
just expected things to hap-
pen too quickly.”

Rumors also began circu-
lating that Kelli Taylor,
Gill’s roommate, was the
next to jump ship, but Jones
feels that these rumors are
just that.

“It’s obviously hard for
any kid to sit out a year and
especially if he has to sit
back and watch his team-
mates lose like [we] did this
year. We see these guys
every day at study table, and
from what we know, they are
happy with being in the pro-
gram, and they’re excited
about next season, and they
want to make. sure nothing
like last year happens again.”

The Panthers were dealt
another loss last week when
assistant coach Sean Miller
resigned from the Panther
coaching staff to join new
head coach Herb Sendek at
North Carolina State. Miller

was an assistant under

Sendek at Miami of Ohio
before coming to Pitt.

“We’re happy for Sean and
his family. He getsia chance
to go back and work with

Herb Sendek again, but at .

the same time, we’re disap-
pointed,” Jones said. “Sean
was a vital part of the pro-
gram, especially when it was
winning back in the ‘80s,
and it’s a big job to turn
things around when a pro-
gram’s down.”

Ironically, Miller was the

lead recruiter in the quest for
6—foot-10 Toronto native
Jamaal Magliore, who
recently signed with Rick
Pitino’s national champion
Kentucky Wildcats. Magliore
was leaning towards coming
to Pitt and even called Ralph

Track team excels at ECAC Championships

Shawn Spragg
The Pitt News

Pitt’s men’s and women’s track and

field teams hit their strides at last
weekend’s ECAC Outdoor Track &
Field Championships held at George
Mason University.

Competing against a field with over
80 other universities, the women took
home third place with 60 team points,
and the men placed ninth with 26
points. Liberty University scorched
the men’s side with 93 points and host
George Mason outdistanced the
women’s side with 98 points.

“This is a meet with schools from
Maine to Florida, all over the East
Coast,” head coach Steve Lewis said.
“This is the next best thing to the
nationals.”

Trecia Smith, the freshman who is
carving out her own special niche with
the Lady Panthers, finished first in the
women’s triple jump with her mark of
43-6 1/2. That mark fell just a foot-
and-a-half shy of teammate Najuma
Fletcher’s 1995 meet record of 44-9
3/4 Smith also won the heptathalon.

“Being a freshman,” Lewis said.
“The response by Trecia is beyond
anything you’d expect. She had a fan-

tastic meet.” -

Fantastic might not be kind enough.
Smith also took third in the women’s
long jump and eighth in the women’s

shot put, and she ran with both the‘

200-meter dash and the sprint relay
teams. .

Smith contributed 27 of Pitt’s 60
points in the weekend meet and
helped push them into third pl-ace
overall. —

Lewis said, “Trecia appears to have
the talent and work ethic to be one of
the best female athletes in college.
But I don’t want to compare her to
Najuma [Fletcher].”

Fletcher, whom most consider to be
one of Pitt’s all-time great athletes,
didn’t fare so well in comparison to
Smith. Finishing third in women’s
high jump and seventh in the long
jump, Fletcher struggled in events she
normally owns.

“Najuma’s hamstring was bothering
her,” Lewis said. “So we decided to
take it easy on her and rest her for the
NCAAs.”

Angie Martin may have qualified for
the NCAA’s for her fifth place finish
in the 800 meter run with a time of
2:08.54.

On the men’s side, sprinter Jay

Jones and hurdler Orrel Green once

again led the squad, each scoring nine
points. Jones finished third in the 100-
meter dash with a time of 10.47 sec-
onds, possibly fast enough to qualify
for the NCAAs. Former Pitt All-
American Lee McRae owns the meet
record with a time of 10.2 seconds in
1987.

Jones also placed sixth in the 200
meter dash.

Green continued an excellent season
on the hurdles with a second place
time of 50.69 seconds in the 400
meter intermediate hurdles, which
should be fast enough to qualify for
the NCAAs. The provisional cut is
51.65 seconds.

“Orrel and Jerel Williams ran some
of their best times ever,” Lewis said.

Williams finished eigth in the 400
intermediate hurdles with a time of
51.9 seconds. Jay Murphy beat Green
in the 110 meter high hurldes, placing
fifth with a time of 14.32 seconds.

“They [the NCAA] take the top 16
times,” Lewis said. “We don’t know
for sure how many people we’ll be
sending; it could be quite a few.
Najuma and Trecia are going for
sure.” V _

Well, whoever goes for Pitt,,_they’ll
be heading to the NCAA Tournament
this weekend.

now the recent action in

-Spartanburg, S.C.

The commissioners in

~ Spartanburg passed the res-

olution as a sympathy mea-
sure with Cobb County, Ga.
Cobb County had voted to
condemn the “gay
lifestyle” back when the
debate over the
Mapplethorpe art exhibit
racked the U.S. Senate.
Cobb’s resolution targeted
the arts but quickly affect-
ed all areas of entertain-
ment.’ In reaction, athletes
from the Olympic volley-
ball competition moved
from Cobb.

The Olympic Committee
might have breathed a sigh
of relief thinking the con-
troversy was behind them.

Nope. The Spartanburg
commissioners’ publicity
stunt was designed to taunt
gay activists. So after the
Olympic Committee’s deci-
sion to move the volleyball
tournament, would it be
any surprise that USA
Gymnastics could decide to
move their training camp?

Some people think there
is no room for politics in
the Olympic movement.
But during its 100-year his-
tory, the Olympics has been
unable to avoid politics.
For years, the Olympic
Commission did not invite
South Africa to participate.

Athletes are modern-day
gladiators going into battle
to defend our city’s or

' nation’s honor. So politics

can’t help but cause head-

- lines on the sports pages in

Olympic years.

Some complain that it’s
wrong for gay activists to
involve athletes in a politi-
cal debate. Then why are
county commissioners
passing these resolutions in
the first place? Passing a
resolution that has no legal
merit condemning a “gay
lifestyle’’ is a blatant politi-
cal action that seeks to

inflame and to create pub-'

lic debate.

It is not the gay activists
who are at fault for ques-
tioning Cobb County’s res-
olution. It is Cobb County
and its imitators in
Spartanburg. The public
officials are the ones taunt-
ing the Olympic Committee
— not the other way
around. The Olympic
Committee has an obliga-
tion to ensure that its ath-
letes and guests feel wel-
come. An athlete should
only have to worry about
his sport — not if he holds
hands with a loved one.

It is not the athlete’s
responsibility to approach
the Olympic Committee
and out himself and say
that he‘doesn’t feel com-
fortable competing in Cobb
County or training in
Spartanburg.

If USA Gymnastics
decides to remove its ath-

letes from Spartanburg, the
organization will ensure
that the attention given to
these athletes would be
because of the athletes
alone.

USA Gymnastics should
not sqaunder the small
amount of press the Men’s
team will receive on a .con—
troversy surrounding the
training facility.

Nichole Gantshar is a staff
writer for The Pitt News
and wishes that Olympic
sports such as gymnastics
and diving were as popular
as football.

Willard last Monday night to tell Willard
that he planned to attend Pitt. That’s when
something went wrong.

Magliore visited Pitt twice during the
recruiting process, including an unofficial
visit to the win over West Virginia at the
Field House in March.

“Jamaal was impressed with our style, and
in Pitt he saw a place where he could come
in and play right away and make a differ-
ence,” Jones said. “Jamaal’s parents came to
Pitt, and they fell in love with the campus
and the city of Pittsburgh in general. From
what they told the coaching staff here at Pitt,
Jamaal was coming to the University of
Pittsburgh.”

One big part of the recruitment process for
Jamaal Magliore had to do with his high
school coach, a coach who had prior contact
with Sean Miller while he was at the
University of Miami of Ohio. Willard visited
with Magliore’s high school coach, and told
Jamaal and his parents after a visit to Pitt
that, “he had absolutely no reservation with
Jamaal playing basketball at Pitt.”

Jones said that Jamaal and his parents took
the coach’s advice and had decided that he

would be wearing a Panther uniform come
November 1996, but that all changed after
the phone call Magliore made to Willard last
Monday.

“He called last Monday and told coach
Willard that he was coming to Pitt. Coach
[Willard] tried to get Sean and myself on a
conference call to hear the news from ‘Jamaal
himself,” Jones said. “Coach couldn’t get a
three—way call from his home, and he lost
Jamaal on the line. We haven’t heard from
the kid since.” _

Jones feels that Sean Miller’s departure
may have caused Magliore and his high
school coach some discomfort.

“They thought we knew about Sean leav-
ing the whole time and that we were just

"keeping it from them until recruiting was
over,” Jones said. “In actuality, we didn’t»

know that Sean was going to N.C State until
late Tuesday night.”

a Magliore may not be the only player lost
following the departure of Miller. Archie
Miller, Sean’s younger brother who gave the
Panthers a verbal commitment to play at Pitt,
has reopened his recruitment for other
schools. Archie has one year remaining at
Blackhawk High School.

TAXI DRIVER
(1976)

D: Martin Scorsese
S:Paul Schrader, Robert DeNiro,
Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel,
Cybill Shepherd

R,l12min.

“Loneliness has followed me
my whole life. Everywhere. In
bars and cars, sidewalks, stores —
everywhere. There’s no escape.
I’m God’s lonely man.” We listen
to Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro)
as he watches the night people on
42nd avenue from inside his taxi.
“All the animals come out at
night,” he says. It is at this partic-
ular moment that we realize
Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver is
not a ﬁlm about a psychotic los-
ing control or a violent pervert on
a rampage, but it is indeed a ﬁlm
about a lonely man in a city
infested with its own people.

Over twenty years ago, screen-
writer Paul Schrader was in a ter-
rible state. He divorced his wife,
left the American Film Institute,

and his career as a ﬁlm critic was

waning. Schrader found himself

_ living out of his car, drinking a

whole lot, and going to pomogra-
phy theaters daily. His health
declined to the point that he had
to be hospitalized. It was here that

Schrader realized he hadn’t spo-

ken to another person in three
weeks. His car had become a
“steel coffin”, and he quickly rec-

ognized that taxi drivers share a
similar situation. Schrader typed

out the first and second drafts of
the screenplay in only ten days as
a personal catharsis, borrowing
heavily from his own experiences.

What is most fascinating about

_ about Taxi Driver is the complex-

ity of character that arises from a
fairly simple story. Travis is
obsessed with two women. Betsy
(Cybill Shepherd) is the woman
that he desires but cannot have,
and Iris (Jodie Foster) is the 12-
year-old prostitute he can have,
but does not desire. In his frustra-
tion over his situation, we slowly
see the anger and plans for vio-
lence growing in his head as cer-
tain events bring the -storyto its
climactic end. One of the more
memorable scenes_ entails director
Martin Scorsese as one of Travis’
passengers who lays out his own
plan to murder his adulterous wife
with a .44 Magnum. Here the idea
of resorting ‘to violence is planted
in Travis’ head, and the story is
further thrown towards its end.
“I’ve got a lot of bad ideas in my
head,” Travis admits with a ner-
vous smile.

The method to Travis’ final
course of action is not spoon-fed
to us, rather the story haunts and
at the same time engages the
viewers’ minds as they watch the
ﬁlm. Indeed, this is the difference
between great cinema and the
standard Hollywood fare. This
ﬁlm respects its audience.

In the same manner, Robert
DeNiro respects his character.
DeNiro is so far into Travis
Bickle that we stop seeing him as
DeNiro. We forget he’s acting.
He’s one of few actors who .can
convincingly disappear inside his

- ‘own character. Travis is obsessed,

and DeNiro knows this. Travis
has trouble relating to women,
and DeNiro knows this. Travis
can sometimes be unaware of the
world around him. DeNiro knows
this. In one particular scene, a

cabbie asks Travis how he is
doing. Travis replies, “What’s
that?” What’s important here is
the look on DeNiro’s face when
he first replies — Travis wasn’t
daydreaming, and he isn’t slow.
He’s simply been ﬂoating around
the city in his “steel -coffin” and
living in his own moral universe.
A great performance like this
comes down to the trust of both
the actor and the viewer in Travis’
character.

In one particular scene, Travis
is standing in a hallway and talk-
ing to Betsy on a pay phone. He
apologizes to her for their argu-
ment the night before. When he
asks if she received the ﬂowers he
sent, she tells him she didn’t. The
camera tracks to the right and
stops on _a shot of an empty hall-
way. Scorsese says he did this
because Travis’ rejection is too
painful to witness. Apparently,
the rejection is more difficult to
watch than the violence during
the film’s climax. The camera
movements and thebrilliant moti-
vations behind them spotlights
Martin Scorsese as one of
America’s greatest directors. He
has a clear and obvious signature,
whereas most Hollywood direc-
tors don’t.

Taxi Driver is clearly a film
about God’s lonely man.
Schrader’s dialogue, DeNiro’s
acting, and Scorse-.se’s attention to
‘character come together brilliant-
ly. Twenty years ago, this film
was up for Best Picture among
three other Academy Award nom-
inations, and it won the

International Grand Prize at the
Cannes film festival. It would
truly be a shame, a dishonor, not

 

”Are you talkin’ to me?”

undercurrents‘
in Cleveland,Ohio
New Music Fest

An orgy of musicians and
artists plastered Cleveland, Ohio
this past weekend leaving the
city in a drunken haze.
Rock’n’rollers from the
Northeast took the city by storm
for the Undercurrents New
Music Fest, reaching decibels of
tantalizing heights. My room-
mate, Amy Lou Dernus and I
hopped from one bar to the next
looking for new talent and sup-
porting local groups. Our pock-
ets and purses were stuffed with
promotional flyers. Tapes and
CDs were flung everywhere.
Each band had a half hour to
dazzle listeners with their best
tunes. Thursday, Friday and
Saturday were jam-packed with
l50.showcasing bands. Indie
labels such as Blue Duck
Records, MonsterDisc, Red
Decibel Records, and Nothing
Records were at the scene scout-

‘ing out promising acts along

with a crusade of music maga-
zine reporters looking for next
year’s hot group. Q&A panels

and entertainment speakers kept
visiting band members busy dur-
ing the day.

The night life transformed into
a candy store for every type of
music. Punk, Folk, Alterna,
Funk, and other various rock
groups sold their souls to the
devil of showbiz as observers
picked and chose the best and
worst of the performers. As each
act pounded out their chords, the
air filled with sweat and frenzy.
Record reps struggled to hold
their composures as rounds of
drinks were bought for them and
each band introduced them-
selves. Managers shook hands
with so many people that they
forgot who the Important People
were. Bands exchanged dates
with other bands. The nights
went on and on with harmonious
encounters of new music.

-Pittsburgh’s emerging artists
made a well-deserved impres-
sion on entertainment reps who
admired the diversity and
integrity of upcoming acts.

Visually stunning images ﬁll the
Stephen Foster stage in Unseam’d
Shakespeare Company’s produc-
tion of “Peer Gynt”. The images
may not always tell a story, and the
audience may not always be sure
what they mean, but like a com-
pelling MTV Video, the production
could be watched with the volume
down again and again.

Which is a good thing —
because the story doesn’t always
make sense, and it runs a bit too
long. “Peer Gynt” is a sprawling
epic play that was a developing
p1aywright’s attempt to retell the
timeless story of rebellion by
impetuous youth and rejection of
social morés. It is a story Henrik
Ibsen, the author of the original

' text, would address successfully in

future plays. To give life to their
production, director and
Department of Theatre Arts
Professor Kiki Gounaridou, and the
actor who portrays Peer, Kyle
Deise, threw out most of Ibsen’s
text and added in much of their
own.

lyrics. The Crybabies are the
Buckeye’s drumlicking
punk/altema band that would fit
nicely in Pittsburgh’s under-
ground music scene. The wailing
beauty of Kama Sutra came all
the way from Buffalo, New
York. You can find these guys at
Blue Duck concerts this summer.
Under the Sun brought Cincinatti
to Cleveland dashing around the
audience with their winning
smiles and southern warmth.

A coffee shop was set up to
display small acoustical acts
sought to get more personal with
their audiences. As the cafe
sipped on espresso, one man acts
such as Rosia O’Shea and Jim
Perrett sang ballads that soothed
listeners after hearing the ranting
and raving of thrash bands like
Skinhorse. Most of the time the
different club settings dictated
the mood of the crowd.

Undercurrents will continue to
be a new rock tradition next
May, same time, same place, but
with new faces.

-sarah lolley

The new dialogue, however,
doesn’t do much to promote the
story or engage the audience.
Gounaridou compensates for this
textual weakness by painting
abstract pictures on stage with
human bodies. If attention drifts, or
words don’t make sense, the
images of the play keep the story
moving.

Working with costume designer
Robert C.T. Steele and scene
designer Chris Howard,
Gounaridou helps the audience
understand the oppressive environ-
ment from which Peer attempts —to
escape in his travels. The charac-
ters high white collars perched on
Stee1e’s sweeping black costumes
tell the story better than any of the
dialogue. It’s a Quaker meeting
gone mad as the characters drift as
ghost-like travelers across the
stage.

A spiraling exit of each character
carrying his ever-present suitcase
ends Act Iand begins Act II, giv-
ing the impression that the audi-
ence is attending the performance
of a modern dance company from
Germany rather than that of a local
theatre group. Experienced theatre-

goers will recognize elements of _

expressionist and post-modem per-
formance techniques used by
European favorites Robert Wilson
and Pina Bausch.

Gounaridou’s focus on the actors
using their bodies creates the most
intoxicating moments of the play.
A dialogue between Anitra (
Christine Rath) and Peer takes
place in a library, and while the
words exchangedbetween Peer
and Anitra may not push the plot
forward, Rath’s desperate physical-
ity makes the seductive intent of
the sceneiclear. Other actors whose
physical presence commands the
audience’s attention are Dennis
Pennell and Scott Carslaw.

A former member of Pitt’s gym-
nastics team, Carslaw has a sense
of gravity, grace, and power even
when standing still that draws
focus throughout the play. Carslaw
often has no lines, but his actions
still steal the scene. ~

Jeff Detweiler was one of th
few cast members who stands out
vocally. He brings a timber and
depth to his words that added
dimension to Gounaridou’s theatri-
cal painting. g

Deise brings a useful measure of
cynicism to his role. He, too,

seduces the audience into the story"

through an act as simple as shav-
ing. Deise brings a subtle precision
to the character that keeps keeps
his extreme actions —— Gynt is
always abandoning women and
supporting revolutions — from
seeming ‘extreme.

In opposition to Peer’s wander-
lust, his sweetheart Solveig
(Desiree Ciancio) sits at home. As
she sits on the stage ﬂoor, lovingly
placing and then repacking old
photos (of what we are never quite
sure). each movement says more
than Ibsen’s words ever could.
When she ﬁnally tells Peer that she
has patiently waited, it is anti-cli-
mactic. The audience has experi-
enced the pain of her waiting
throughout the three hours of the
play. ,

All of the images demonstrate
that Gounaridou knows how to edit
her own ideas to create a successful
production. Each object she places
on the stage tells a story. The dia-
logue alone could have used a bit
more editing. Gounaridou and
Deise use the greatest theorists of
the post-modem age in their acade-
mic work and use Ibsen to explore
some of these theories in perfor-

9
mance. They play with the ideas by
having various characters repeat
Jacques Derrida-inspired thoughts
about the inability of languageto
communicate and how “linguistic
boundaries have collapsed.”

Some of this may only make
sense to English Department grad-
uate students, but to the rest of the
audience, the intensely focused
performances of the acting ensem-
ble, the compelling images, and the
timeless story of Peer’s search for
meaning make it a great choice for
a languorous summer evening. The
play runs until June 1.
