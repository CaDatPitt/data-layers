M C Elections ‘Routine,’
O’Connell Elected Veep

By AL DONALSON

The politicking which was expected during last Wed-
nesday’s Men’s Council internal election never materialized.
Instead, the election ran off in a routine manner as two of
the candidates were elected by acclamation. ' r

Dan O’Connell, Engr. ’58, and Bob Barrickman, Col. ’57,

were elected vice-president and¢

treasurer, respectively, without
opposition. O’Conne1l is an Inde-
pendent while Barrickman is a
member of the Panther Party.

A political tussle had been
expected between the two for
the vice-presidency, but the
Panther delegation‘ permitted
0’Connell to be elected when
they did _not nominate anyone
for the position.

Although they had only four
votes (0 use in Council, the All-

, Pitts had the balance of power

since the ‘Panthers had ten repre-
sentatives and the Independents
had eleven.

After the election results were
announced, Jack Hardman, assist-
ant to the dean of men in charge
of student government, said that
he thought “all the men elected to
office. are qualiﬁed.” Hardman also

‘praised the political parties for

arranging so that each party has
a man on the MC executive com-
mittee.  - V ,
Others elected were John L.
Sullivan, Col. ’59, recording sec-

going to make them for the men of
the University, not for political
parties.”

Married Couples Form
Special Interest Groups

A portion of the married couples at Pitt have organized
into special interest groups in order to “get together.” “Cam-
pus Couples,” the married college students of Terrace Vil-
lage, held a meeting at Wadsworth Center, Thursday even-
ing, April 26, to set up a program for the group. The initial
meeting Was well attended by approximately 40 couples.

The Couples plan to divide into special interest groups.

- Sections which have been es-¢
tablished are “The Bargan Shop-

pers” and “The Baby-Sitting
League” i_n which each of the
couples may beneﬁt directly from
the .work of their group.

The whole organization will be
co-ordinated by a council of
members from the individual in-
terest groups. An organization
publication, “Campus Coupler,”
has already published one edition
to inform Terrace Village Couples

of the accomplishments of the

meeting and the work of interest
groups. ' A

Ac cording to reorganization
chairman, Harvey Libowitz, in-
structor in English, this group
should ‘be more successful than
others of its type because of the
division into sections. The mem-
bers‘ feel that they will receive
two deﬁnite advantages from this
arrangement.

First, responsibility and author-
ity for the successful flinctioning
of each activity will fall upon
those who are directly interested

in that activity, rather than on
the group as a whole. The waste
of time which occurs in mass

meetings will be eliminated. Ac-.

cording to Mr. Libowitz, interest
in large groups started in the past
has faltered, because it _is too
difficult to interest everybody in
the same activity.

Last November, Terrace Village ,

couples did attempt to form a
joint organization, but it didn't
succeed, because of the views ex-
pressed by Libowitz, the chair-
man.

to revive, at least for Terrace
Village people who must keep ex-
penses low, the Student Discount
Service which Student Songress
created two years ago.. » ‘

Officers were elected at the ﬁrst  at

meeting and will attempt to carry
out the program during the 1956

school year. The group will meet ~

  Top - Flight Students

Although"the University is assuming gigantic propor-
tions, the goal of educators here will be to make life more

‘intimate for students——and to assure a higher caliber stu-

dent takingpart in the progressive program.

But one big obstacle must be overcome. Not, few top-
rate students have been scared away from Pitt because
they heard that they would be cramped into a crowded 8x12
classroom with 360 other students and stamped with a
number. , _ -» , ‘

This notion was quickly shattered for approximately
60 high school seniors Wednesday, April 18, when Mortar‘

Board and Omicron Delta Kappa members showed them an .
 average day in college. The fact that Pittites were able to
 participate in close discussion in class and that professors

knew their students by name was more aprevelation for
the teen-age leaders than probably any other thing.

“ But the Mortar Board—-ODK Leaders’. Day brought to ,
,':’Llight'another important concept of registration. Although
the college students were requested .not to propagandize
- in Pitt—the object of the program being to show the boys

and girls an average college day which they might experi-
‘ence anywhere——many of the students ‘who had‘not yet

desire to come here. 1

This can be done by inviting students to attend classes-,

Sound Tradition _‘Respecte'd

R° ht
By Irv Rothman

When the Queen of England was crowned two
years ago, she was required to say an oath over the
Bible that virtually veriﬁed her position as titular
head of the Anglican Church. '

She kneeled in humility that so slight a woman
could maintain so high a position in both church
and state; and the whole world wished a lovely
woman God-speed.  "

So, too, have the women at’
our-‘University incorporated the
Bible ceremony in their Corona-
tion.‘ But. only because it was
used in the English ceremony.
To compare the two ceremonies
would be abhorrent to the Eng-
lish, but because I respect sound
tradition, I will risk their dis-
dam.’

Prayer Valid?

The Senior Queen, dressed in royal vestige,

, swears before the Holy Bible that she too will

reign wisely over the women of the University.
The anointir_1g_ of King Solomon is read. But where

the one prayer is valid, the Coronation offering is

a desecration of a book which all too many people
consider too important to be included in a circus
maximae. ' '

Certainly we are members of a secular institu-‘

tion which respects religion for the values. it of-
fers, urges the Bible for reading for the basic
morals it teaches.

  Rites Considered

But the Bible should not be included in any

in a ceremony which is consistently the butt of
jokes for both men, women, and faculty of this.

While the British Coronation has remainedwan
important tradition, it has remained so only be- I

 

cause it fulﬁlls the particular desires of a peoples

steeped in ’tradition—a tradition which carries
through one’s political, economic, and religious life.
With its gaudy vestments, forced animation, and fab-
ricated speeches, Coronation here fulﬁlls-no true
tradition. It serves only as a spectacle which
“sledge hammers” the announcement of a Senior‘
Queen on Tap Day.

Coronation in England was born of tradition.
Coronation at Pitt was created for tradition. The

use of the Bible in theological servicesis important '

to provide an understanding of religious principles.
The use bf the Bible in Coronation at ‘this Uni-
versity is to provide that ceremony with any
credulity it may have. - ‘

Chaplain —Emory Luccock should look intoxthis
situation for the sake of religious honesty that is
not apparent in Coronation.

From the University standpoint, religious cere-

Sowell Runs Futile Lap

As Panther Attack Bogs  

By JOHN FAY , _ '
With‘ Arnie Sowell, the prime Olympic 800-meter favor-
ite, running the anchor leg in the sprint medley relay, the

Panthermen were expected to

a ﬁrst place at the Penn Relays this past week-end. -.
When Sowell was handed the baton, he was 60 yards '

be strongly in the running for

behind Villanova’s Ron Delany and too far back to even
-hope to gain .a victory. The Blue and Gold did overcome all

the other competition to cop a6 \

second place.

Coach Carl Olson’s squad didn’t
fare too well, because there were
only three other events in which

How Permanent
Is Pitt Stadium?

By Ed Bachman
News Editor

 

Ever play a hunch? Even a wild one? Well, we’ve got
one that takes the cake. We think that in thenext ten years
_the famous Forbes Field will become property of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

"The location of the Stadium is far from being ideal.
"Built on a big hill, people have moaned for years about

being forced to climb at a 45 degree angle to get to a game._

Okay, so you have a car. That should make it a little
easier on the hill-climbing. But, once you get up there,
where are you going to park?—-another problem which has
long remained unsolved.

The seating capacity has, up to now, been adequate. Our
biggest year in game average was 1938, when we averaged
42,000 per game. But this record has a good chance of being
‘smashed this year, despite the switching of the Duke game from
the home schedule. —

Think of the crowds which will pack the Stadium for
Notre Dame and Army this fall. An 80,000 capacity ﬁeld
would be nice, but we’ve only got a 60,000 one. And now
that our football fortunes are looking up for the ﬁrst time
since before World War II, the present seating capacity is
continually going to be insufﬁcient. ’

4 Another “pain”._ connected with the present ﬁeld . . .-
It’s located right near some of Oakland’s hospitals, and

there have been many complaints of the noise on football
Saturdays. But this has been something with which the
University has been unable to do anything.

So, all in all, it would be very practical to tear down this
mammoth structure, which is. still far from being paid for, and
build §omething else on the location. '

Okay, we’ve settled the “fate” of the present Stadium.
Now where does ‘Forbes Field 'come in? ’
0 The biggest thing in favor of the Forbes Field area for

use by Pitt is its location. The Field couldn’t be situated ,

in a better spot for a Pitt football stadium. With the present

-.structure torn down, a beautiful stadium could be built in

the Forbes Field-Schenley Oval area, with a large seating

capacity, and with space for parking. '

' What about the Pirates? Pittsbu.rgh’s professional base-
ball club has been dissatisﬁed with Forbes Field ever since
they proved they could draw big crowds with a winning club.

_ . ‘In the past 10 years the-Pirates have had only one ﬁrst
iionlteam. This was the 1948 squad. To refresh me-
mories (and it takes good ones to recall when the. Pirates
_were breathing clean air), that was the year when the
Buccos were.ﬁghting for the pennant. They ﬁnally ﬁnished
fourth, after folding soon after Labor ‘Day. ’

The club drew nearly. a million and a half fans that
year, and the~33,000 seating ycapacitywas far from ade_

Gridder’s Fine Showing

Optimism

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Coach John Michelosen pulled a “Walt Keisling” during.

the ﬁrst half—obserVing from the press boX.—as the second-
year mentor unveiled his 1956 Panther football squad in

Fans Pleased
When the contest was over most
of the fans went away rather
pleased with what they had just
viewed —— some
of them un_
doubtedly con-
vinced that the
Blue and Gold
wll have just as
good a season
in ’56 as they
had last ' year,
maybe better.
The partic-
ipants were

them took a step in that direc-
tion with impressive perform-
ances.

Lewis solidiﬁed his chances of
winning the quarterback nod by
calling a good game as he mixed

‘aerial and pass patterns for huge

yardage.

Walton In Top Form
Another veteran with all—Amer—
ica aspirations—-Joe Walton~dis-
played mid—season form that cap-
tured the fancy of everyone with
his phenomenal pass-catching and
stellar defensive play. I
Michelosen may have found
the answer to one of his guard
problems in the likes of Vince

quate.
' Now the Bucs have

to beg people to come to the‘ games.

Many of those 33,000 seats gather dust the entire‘ season. But,
and this, is a big if, if the team ever starts moving up, the Forbes
Field situation will again be a. headache. . .

The club.owners have secretly Wished for the money to

build a new ball park in the

lower hill district, giving the

fans a modern ﬁeld, in a centrally located place, and with
a huge parking lot. They haven’t the support or the money

to do this now. .

So everything hinges on the Pirates’ future. If and when
they start climbing, the demand. will be greater for a new
ﬁeld. And when that demand becomes a reality, Pitt will
have the inside track to move in.

There is no lag in the Panther’s

fared nicely on otfense, too.

Sophomores who looked excep-
tionally well in their ﬁrst varsity
skirmish were end Jim‘Zanos and

George Hailel, Fred Riddle, and
John Flara.

This quintet of ball-toters put
a quick damper on rumors that
the. Panthers lacked speed in the
backﬁeld. "

, Fullbacks Stark '(190) and
Riddle (170) both showed’ a
‘combination of power and speed -
on long gainers up the middle
' as they outraced the secondary
for gains of better than 40 yards.

Haley and Flara ran the ends
like sprinters while the highly
touted Kaliden saw only limited
action on offense, playing mostly
on defense. But while he was in-
there he was able to throw a run-
ning pass for a touchdown-to enii
