‘For two opinions on PIRG, see
page tour.

A Monday meeting of the Sen-
ate Council focused on the differ-
ences of opinion between the ad-
ministration and the proponents
of the Public Interest Research
Group.

Although no members of PIRG
were present, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar brought the issue’s con-
troversial funding mechanisms
tothe attention of the Council and
asked for input from the Student
Government leaders present.

Posvar stressed that he was not

attempting to present the entire '

statue of the issue but said that

the position of the administration

required clarification.

PIRG leaders,‘after collecting _V

9,000 signatures from University
students, are requesting a $2 per
term refundable tee to be used for
the hiring of staffs working for
the public benefit.

with sufficient funds through al-
location. -

Tom Bailey, SG Board presi-
dent, told the_Council that SG is‘
largely receptive to -the goals of
PIRG but pointed out that even if
the proposal for funding by alloca-
tion is approved, a drastic over-
haul of the government’s funding
mechanisms would’ be necessi-
tated.

Under present by-laws, the Stu-
dent Government cannot legally
collect money and turn it over to a
group if the money is to be used
for salaries. ’

Bailey suggested the possibil-.

ity of a referendum on the issue,
noting that PIRG had not yet
come to'SG on the subject of al-
locations.'The SG, he said, "does
not yet see the signatures as a

mandate.”

tion of their fee through the SG.

tion, they say, is based on the
ephemeral nature of student gov-
ernment and the allocations pro-
cedures.

In addition, PIRG leaders claim
that their optional fee proposal is
more equitable than “coercive”
activities fees.

Posvar told the Council that he
foresees the activities fee’s be-
coming jeopardized when stu-
dents demand refunds on the
PIRG fee. Posvar said that stu-
dents receiving refunds of one
segment of the fee might also re-
quest rebate on the activities fee
as a whole.

He said he "feels very ‘strong-
ly” that there are feasible options
to the funding mechanism pro-
posed by the group. \

APPOINTMENTS TABLED

The Council also tabled the re-
quest of Alden-- Bowen, co-
ordinator of the campus judicial,
system, for appointment of mem-
bers to the Judicial Review Com-
mittee. "

The motion was tabled after

/Campus leaders explore roles 

by BOB GEDIEKOH
In a move to ‘improve. the qual-

ity of University leadership, Stu-A I

dent Government ‘leaders, facul-

I ty, and administrators attended

the National Leadership Insti-
tute’s “Training Program at the
4-H‘-Center’ in Washington, D. C..
last weekend.

' The convention, under. the aus-
pices of a private company that
‘specializes in training executives.’
aimed to help leaders become
forceful and responsible, regard-
less of their backgrounds or fields
of endeavor.

Student ' Government Board

.President— Tom‘ Bailey said that

the program will aid him .in di-

' recting, future activities and. in "

dealing with other studentllead-’

ers. Bailey noted that the diverse‘

input of administrators, students,
business executives, and faculty
members at the convention help-
ed make the sessions relevant
and interesting to all.

I He noted enthusiastically that.
the exchange of ideas at the pro-

gram “will enhance and enrich

our own leadership theories as we
apply them tothe constantly
changing challenges of leader-
ship.”

,At the outset of the program

_Friday night all participants were

instructed to mix and mingle to

find a compatible partner for the.

weekend. The newly-formed pairs
combined with other couples to
form working groups of eight._

Following group seminars and
experiments, each member of a
group was evaluated by the other
group members so that he could
see himself the way others see
him. .

In six months the participants
will exchange personal evalua-
tions as _a reminder of the results

,of the program. V‘ . t. _  .
* , -Bailely said} that the ip,rog,ram “ ,

At .Washington,  conference

emphasized two extreme leader-
ship stereotypes which are gen-

'—erally ineffective: a wis‘hy-washy

leader who serves only as a fig-
urehead and a dictatorial leader,
who uses other people only as rub-
ber stamps. ‘ '

g ‘The ideal leader, he said, lies

somewhere between, these two ex-

tremes.

SG Board member Terri Weav-

ver agreed that the meetings clear-

ly showed the dangers of flimsy
or domineering leadership.

"The program ‘allowed the par-'
ticipants to experience the role of
taking a minority stand on aniis-'
sue and to exchange-ideas with
students from other campuses,”
Weaver said. ' ‘

One" especially interesting ac-
tivity, Weaver said, was the paint-
ing of a large picture by each
group of eight. After each paint-
ing was completed, each group
memberwas asked to evaluate his

contribution to the work as well

as the contribution of each of the
other participants. These evalua-
tions were exchanged so that each

WASHINGTON (AP >—In a small.
windowless office across the
street from the White House, a 30-
year-old advertising man named
Ken Rietz is organizing a nation-
wide campaign to capture the
youth for President Nixon.

Rietz, a native of Oshkosh, Wis.,
and now a partner in a- Washing-
ton advertising firm, is director
of the Youth Division of the Com-
mittee to Re-elect the President.

His goal is to get the Republican
message across to as many of the
nation’s 25 millionnew voters as
possible. To do the job he has a
paid staff of 14 assistants, all un-
der 30.

“were putting together a Young
Voters for the President group in
every state,” Rietz said in an in-
terview. “The first thing we have
to do is get them registered.”

For the moment, the Youth Di-
vision is concentratingon key pri-
mary states and already has set
up offices in New Hampshire,
Florida, Wisconsin, California,
and Illinois. L

If Rietz’ office is small, his bud-
get isn’t. “It’s more than any Re-
publican had put into this kind of

‘ campaign,” said Rietz. He refus-
-ed to disclose any figures except

staff salaries, which run from $5,-
000 to $11,000.

With registration among new
voters currently running two-to-
one Democratic, Rietz and his as-
sistants are working 12-to-15-hour
days to organize a nationwide net-
work of volunteers for the pre-
cinct-level jobs of ringing door-
bells and setting up registration
drives.

The plan works this way: In
each state, volunteers will con-
tact potential -voters, first by
phone, then with follow-up letters.
The information gathered is sent
to the Washington headquarters
where it is kept on file in compu-
ters with other statistical data on
young voters.

“Also, we plan to-set up train-

ing centers for speakers and vol-
unteers. in each state,” said Ken

Smith, 22, of Harbeson, Del. “We
want to give them briefings and
supply them with facts and fig-
uresf’

Smith, who has charge of re-
cruiting Republican speakers for
young audiences, and his col-
leagues are well aware that only
one-fifth of the new voters are on
college campuses. Although they
are scheduling Cabinet officers

Atillltlnlliaps   Nixtlnr;-with 

on key campuses, the emphasis
of their campaign is on non-col-
lege youth.

"Non-college youth are virtually
ignored as far as political par-
ticipation is concerned," said
Tom Bell, 24, of Memphis, Tenn.
"We hope to contact people in
businesses and work very closely
with technical schools and busi-
ness colleges. '

B tll attacks pro ratdmg

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)—A bill introduced in the House Monday
would prevent an athlete on scholarship at a Pennsylvania college from
playing professional sports for five years, if he signs a contract before
graduation.

Rep. Samuel Frank, D.-Lehigh, sponsored the bill. “The concept of
our proposal is that the pros are going to be a lot more reluctant to
dish out $100,000 and $200,000 contracts when they know they’re going
to be paying for five years of inactivity,” Frank said.

“Obviously, there's a question of constitutionality in the propos-
al,” Frank continued, “but our feeling is that we've got to start some-
where before this growing menace gets more out of hand than it al-
ready is.”-

“Last year it was Howard Porter of Villanova," Frank said. "Be-

fore that it was Matty Goukas of St. Joseph's. Even Wilt Chamberlain.

a product of the Philadelphia school system, waslured away from a
college career at Kansas before his graduation.”

Frank’s bill would also set a $5,000 fine for any professional team
signing a Pennsylvania student on an athletic scholarship or subsidy

"while in school, and require any collegelathlete getting financial aid to

sign an agreement converting the aid into a non-interest bearing loan
should_he turn pro before graduation.

Draft local dismissal fought

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—A'21-year-old college student who was
dismissed as a draft board member after he reportedly declared that
deferments should be given on request asked U.S. District Court Mon-
day to reinstate him on the board.

Warren Lassin of Philadelpha, a student at Philadelphia Commun-
ity College, also asked for $15,000 in damages in a suit filed against
Curtis W. Tarr, Nationa-1 Selective Service director, and Robert Ford,
state draft chief. '

Lassin claimed officials violated his constitutional rights when
they dismissed him from a Philadelphia draft board after he allegedly
told a television interviewer that anyone who thinks heineeds a draft
deferment should get one. ~ . \

Lassin lost his seat on Local Board" 134 Feb. 16. He had been a
member of the board for two weeks. '

In his suit Lassin contended that portions of the television inter-
view were taken out of context by officials who decided to oust him.

a Lassin also said that excerpted portions did not reflect his views.
He said that if he returned to the draft board he would follow the re-
quirements of his position. .

. Lassin said the action taken against him was "arbitrary and capri-
c1ous.”

State-owned schools’
board rneetings opened

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)-—State Education Secretary John 

Pittenger Monday ordered that all board of tqustees meetings at the 14 ’

state-owned colleges be public.

Pittenger reportedly has received complaints from students about
closed trustee meetings in his travels around the state.

“I feel strongly that the intent of the ‘Right to Know’ Act was to V
give citizens and taxpayers access to their public situations,” Pitteng-A
er said. “It is incumbent on us as public servants to make our activites‘

. fessional

open and accessible to the citizens who support us.”

The newly stated policy retains the opportunity forxboards of trus-'

tees to meet in executive session. Pittenger said, however. such meet-
ingsshould be limited to situations that may be "unfairly injurious to

an individual’s reputation."

The decision by Pittenger does not apply to the state-related
schools, Penn State, Pitt, and Temple; community colleges; or private. V

state-supported colleges.

(Trustee meetings at Pitt were opened to the media last term.)

University counsel James R.

discussed, they illuminated’ im-

“The main issue,’_’ said Wolf,
“was the extent to which, either

' as a matter of‘ law or policy,

the university and college should
provide various forms of proced-
ural relief to the non-tenured pro-
fessor ‘who has been told he

 The‘ following is a cIariIicqtion_

 Recently the administration of the University
was asked‘ to establish a two dollar per year
charge on its. invoices for all students in order to
produce a fund for the Public Interest Research
Group (PIRG), an organization which, in our op— "
inion,.'has laudable, objectives in the field of

It‘-is hoped that PIRG can accomplish its purpose

_ This decision does leave PIRG with some’at-

government is empowered to set a student activi-

¥_s’tu'dent organizations on campus. As a. recognized
campus, organization, PIRG could petition student
government to increase the amount of the. fee

 ,_ An objection to one specific form of the PIRG '
proposal is that, in effect,’ it would use the Uni-
.-,_vl_ersity’,s‘ fee-collecting powers, including the "san-
jaetions inherent in them, to impose a special-pur- 
pose tax on all .student's_,without the prior approval

innocuous. Legislators sometimes
ask, for example, for information
about the University. In such
Arnold’s service with a
smile is proper and worthwhile.

In other cases, however, the
propriety of Arnold’s service is
not clear. Consider, as an illus-
tration, calls from legislators re-
garding students.

All in all, Arnold‘ estimates,

the Governmental Relations Of-—t
fice receives 500 or 600 inquir-

ies from legislators about students
“The majority of
these inquiries,” Arnold reveals,
“arerequests from admission.” -

One would hope that such in-
quiries would be met by a po-
lite but firm explanation of the
fact that the University’s admis-
sions decisions are made by its
separate Schools and are not sub-
ject to outside interference.

Unfortunately, this is not ‘the
case. n '

When Arnold receives a phone
call from a legislator who wants
to get a student admitted to Pitt,
he does his utmost to get therstu-
dentadmitted. In his own words,
“I will ask for special consider-

aﬂonf’
This “special consideration“
is not‘quite as reprehensible as
it sounds. Usually it means that
Arnold will ask admissions per-
sonnel to look thoroughly at a
student’s qualifications and grant
the student an interview before
rejecting him. i A

_,__ji“,The -student ‘activities fee is aself-imposed tax
»‘~by students on students. Those who administer’ -
'.'i't}'are at least subject to recall by the full stu-.
dent body via the electoral process. :We are not
"convinced by the argument that any funds col-
;'lected,. for PIRG by this method would be inef-
gifective because ﬂsubject to the whim of student
“government,” or the argument that student govern-
~.ment is necessarily unrepresentative of the student
??body,The alternative to student government is for
'~*-.the'~ University administration to re-assume the '
_.old role of surrogate parent in student affairs.

«  If student government is not representative or
 “responsible, we should endeavor to make it so,
 and the large constituency supporting PIRG could
"help accomplish just that. .If we went outside of
student government to fund such—an activity -we
"(_:ould“. destroy it. Student government should be
*pI‘ofoundly impressed by the thousands of signa-
‘tiires PIRG claims to havecollected on petitions,
ask_'ing for the imposition of such a levy.
.‘  For those potential contributors to PIRG not
covered by the student activities fee——such as
graduate students, faculty, administrators and"
‘st_‘aff—the administration already has told PIRG
that it would be willing to assist in providing
‘mechanisms through which voluntary contribu-
‘,‘-tions other than by invoice could be sought, or
"g!'.aduate_ activity fees increased by appropriate

for PIRG,than some other mechanism for solicit-
ing voluntary contributions, Many students, who
might not contribute voluntarily to the organiza-
tion would not bother to go through the trouble of
.obtaining the refund, but would nonetheless re-
sent the process. ,

PIRG also has said it would be willing to ‘con-
sider a voluntary check-off on the invoice, but
even this proposal leaves a basic_.question: If the ‘-
University were -' to set this precedent for PIRG, t
then on what objective grounds could it refuse to ‘
collect funds outside the student fee mechanism
for some -other organization with a University con-
stitllency and goals that its sponsors consider

There are many charitable groups, public
interest groups and political action organizations I
which could and certainly might‘ want to seek .
to avail themselves of the same opportunity, and
toward which we might feel the same admira-
tion that we do for the. goals of PIRG. This '
would impose the need for a priority ‘~ choice,
with ethical implications, outside -the‘ system of
student governance. - " '

 

 

While we have often spoken of" the Univer- 
sity’s role of public service, and believe. firmly
that‘the'University must extend its intellectual
influence to the wider community, this is proper-.

— 'ly done as an outgrowth of the University’s pri-
mary missionsof teaching and research. These
functions are what the University ‘is organized to
do, and administrative powers constructed to sup-
port these objectives should not'_be diverted direct- ‘
ly to some other purpose. The collection of an’
activities_fee is a major but crucial adjunct to
these administrative powers and the inclusion of'
PIRG in that fee maybe most appropriate.

The setting of fees does involve approval of
the University’s trustees‘. The University’s/trus-
tees, -by law, have the ultimate responsibility
for-the expenditure of funds that are placed un-
dertheir trusteeship by public and ‘private sources,
or which are collected from user-s of‘ University ’
services under thepowers given to the institution
by the laws which created it. While the trustees
-cannot truly delegate fiduciary responsibility, .
the administration and students do have delegated
‘budgetary authority and theyarerequired to as-
sure that proper auditing andaccounting is made
‘of expenditures. Only those expenditures which
are legal under the by-laws of the institution and
auditable are approved.

' Thisicouldpreclude PIRG turning over a ‘lump

sum to the. national or regional PIRG organiza-

tion, with which the local campus group is affil-
iated, but certainly would not restrict the campus ‘

officers, he checks "to make
sure we haven’t missed some-
thing we should consider. . .like
personality or drive.”

Does this mean that Arnold
personally endorses candidates
for admission who are backed
by their state legislators ? Some-
what cryptically, Arnold replies,
“Anytime I take a job, I expect
‘to win.”

Arnold hastens to add that his
batting average is poor.

Thus, the practical - conse-
quences of Arnold’s interven-
tion are not very striking,

The principles involved, how-
ever, are perhaps worth ponder-
ing.

In asking admissions officers

‘for “special consideration” for
students backed by a statelegis-
lator, Arnold is effectively dis-
criminating against students who
have no political connections.

Asked whether he considers
this unfair, Arnold responds that
the admissions process is unfair.
‘ More than that, he says, the
worldisunfair. ’

“The world being what it is,;

and people being what they are,”

a /sage, “decisions depend on
what you,know, who you know,
and luck.” ‘

Though Arnold says he _would

prefer a world where "what you '

know” counted more, he is not
helping bringiabout such a world.

On the contrary, he is promoting
the welfare of students with po-
litical connections.

Asked to admit that his prac-
tices tend to increase the im-
portance of “who you know."
Arnold equivocates. “It could be,"
he says. And, of course, it is.

But Arnold refuses to relin-
quish the adage he learned while
in business: “A salesman’s job
is to protect the customer against
the corporation.” Translated,
this means that Arnold protects
his clients from the University.

So, Arnold continues to func—_
tion as Harrisburg’s lobbyist‘ at

Pitt, and no one seems to mind. ‘

Defending his role. Arnold

points ‘out that he often brings .
bureaucratic problems to light '

and helps remind admissions of-
ficers that they are dealing with
people, not names .or

But Arnold’s requests for
“special consideration” make it
clear that one of the Univer-

sity’s offices is actively promot- ~

ing favoritism.

Though strong-willed - admis-
sions officers resist Arnold’s
pressures, the fact of intra—Uni-

By faithfully representing his

The Rusting of America

“Is he honest who resists his gen-

tion?” V

-William Blake

In the decade of the 60's a flurr_v ,
of activities by students in Amer-

ican colleges and universities
shook the foundations of a part of
the traditional wisdom.

Sages of American culture had
pointed to the uninterested afflu-
ent generation of the '50's. As
John Galbraith said, “They were
too well off to care.”

In the following decade, the
field of political activity was pep-

’3‘pered with incidents of activism.

involvement, and protest. Mean-
while, numerous articles and
books were written by yet another

7 set ofsages, eager to interpret

these student political and cultur-
al movements as the coming of a
new era: the Greening of America.
With the advantage of just two
years hindsight, it would seem
that the canons of the new revolu-
tion were written in a vacuum.

Few would argue that youth val-

 ues have not changed. Students

use more drugs than before, more
pre—marital and extra—marital
sexual relations occur between
and among the sexes. For the
most part, students deride the

they are in school.

However, that new political con-
cern—the concern for, social jus-
tice and humane values that was

' supposed to ggow and become sig-

nificant —— has not materialized.

Consciousness III — the deep
commitment to self and to the
welfa_re .of the community—has
withered into an Unconscious-
ness IV‘.

Unconsciousness IV is the state
of mind symptomatic of youth
during the era of the_l970’s. In
sharp contrast to Charles Reich’s
celebrated Consciousness III
where people are concerned with
an awareness of self_, others, and
nature, Unconsciousness IV is a
state of being indifferent to others
—selfish, nihilistic and hedonistic.

Though selfishness/among the
young is manifested in two com-
pletely different fashions, the
effects on society are similar.

One large group which has per-
sisted and grown seeks the tradi-
tional values of America: pres-
tige, affluence, security. The path
to this is to be found through an
adherence to the Protestant ethic:
of hard work. A desire for high
grades and a good jobyprospect

or admission to the right law
school characterize this group.

The ‘ other group represents the
so-called “hippie or drug culture.”

‘These people have dropped out of

the community in a different way.
They seek selfish goals and in-
stant gratification. One fellow
best expressed this attitude by
saying, “I don't like to be hassled
and I don’t like to hassle. That
way I can just do my own thing
and everything’s cool.”_ -

Both groups display a distinct
disinterest in the "welfare of the
community"or in furthering pro-
gressive values. Perhaps
could analogize this state of af-
fairs with the One Dimensional
Society described by Herbert
Marcuse. Students have fallen
into the category of those who
contribute to "the paralysis of
criticism: a society without op-
position."

Many philosophers argue that 

progress _ cannot occur with

out struggle which brings outi

contradictions in a society and

hence expedites reform. A host
of great thinkers from Marx and
Lenin to Mao Tse—tung and Ray-
mond Aron have canonized this
belief. While this struggle may
take a form ranging from the loy-

al opposition in the United States ’

to a Cultural Revolution in China,
it is nevertheless essential.

To paraphrase Aron, the 60’s
were a period of relative pro-
gress for the advancement of hu-
man values. Without the sustain-
ed opposition and concern of
young people, the ’70’s may be a
period of regression and disillu-
sionment.

I personally am opposed to
PIRG’s funding proposal largely
on principle: I dislike being put

I wish by this letter to congrat-

  letter to
the editor

-'-I‘-he administrations firm
stand, in spite of the obvious sup-
port the proposal enjoyed from
the Pitt News and the dark mur-
murings of its proponents that the
decision was made out of “admin-
istrative fear of state-reprisals,"
demonstrated a degree of respon— -

To me, this sounds too much
like the record’ clubs in which one
is sent the “record selection of
the month” unless he sends in the
refusal slip by a specified date, or
the stamp companies which send

proval;” Indeed, comparing
PIRG’s scheme with that of the
record clubs is unduly flattering
to PIRG.

Whereas it is'necessary to send

out stamps to collectors “on ap- -

stamp company to be put on their
mailing list, future classes of Pitt
students would find themselves
subscribed to PIRG simply be-
cause in 1972 the organization’s
supporters had waved a list of 9,-
0000 signatures in an administra-
tor’s face. I don’t believe that
Ralph Nader himself has ever in-
vestigated a deal any shadier than
thatone.

The advantage to an organiza-
tion of shifting the burden of ac-
tion from its supporters to its non-
supporters is obvious. Even if one
assumes that the refund mechan-
ism was made perfectly clear to
all students, PIRG would stand to
gain the contributions of all those
who were too busy, too shy, or too
lazy to collect their refunds.

I

As new generations of college
freshmen come in,
themselves in their new surround-
ings and knowing no one of their
friends who had gotten such a re-
fund, they would be most likely to
let their “contribution” ride,

whether or not they themselves

had had the chance to form an
opinion about PIRG. i

Yet I am not a moralist, and
my reasons for opposing PIRG‘s
financial proposal are not all so
abstract. It seems clear that the
PIRG group is proposing a prece-
dent, whatever they may say to
the contrary.

If this year a group is allowed
to collect $2 from each student on
behalf of an organization for en-
vironmental and consumer ,,pro-

tection, why should yve not believe .

that next _year some anti-war

single "oneself out as a non-sup-
porter of “good causes” which I,
as one who has become a strong
doubter in the goodness of many
of the “good -causes” bandied
about_today, feel particularly
acutely.

Do I have such doubts about
PIRG itself? Yes. most definite-

. ly. Yet Ishall not go into them

here for fear that my objections
to PIRG’s funding proposal might
be misconstrued to be no more
than a rationalization for my ob-
jections to the PIRG -organization

After four years of student apa-

I thy, I must write about my experi-

ence in the Szabo cafeteria. I was
feeling pretty good on Wednesday
morning after attending classes.
I couldn’t wait to eat lunch but my
eating fell short when my girl-

friend frantically yelled, "John

don’t eat that cracker!”

With a Sesame seed cracker
half lodged in my throat and half
on my tongue, I said chokingly.
"Why? What’s wrong?" Mygirl
exclaims, “Oh John,‘ there’s a
worm in the crackers.”

I looked on the tray and there it
was, a nice little tan worm with
little whiskers. Even I was gross-
ed out. Thinking she had swallow-
ed a little creature, my girl was
going to stick her fingers down
her throat right then. Instead, we
reported our findings to the Szabo
management.

I noted many attempts by stu-
dents striking against the Szabo

_ food tenure at Pitt Towers. this

year. If something isn’t done soo

-about the food service, the Pit
students are really settling to
less.

I realize that the crackers were
pre—packaged by some company
and are not directly the fault 0
Szabo. But how long have those
crackers been laying around»Sza

~bo’s store of mouth-watering
goodies? Only Szabo knows for
sure. I

I feel that the people eating the
food have noticed along with me
that improvements are desper
ately needed. Let the students ask
themselves, "What have they eat
en lately that they haven’t noticed
or are they too sick to tell?

Sheltered by a somewhat worn green Navy jack-
et and sporting a growth that Robinson Crusoe

would have been proud of, Jay Rosenstein walked"

into the Pitt News Sports Office a couple weeks ago,
almost like a ghost out of the past.

Or should I say a legend, that gains its sub-
stance from countless hours of dedication to a cause
nobody has deemed worthy" of fighting for yet. A
cause that has -roots in the dynamic process of Pitt
athletics and gains life through the daily trials and

' tribulations of that process. .

Jay Rosenstein was sport_s editor of the Pitt
News four years
’ T   -. . before I said good-bye to North-
east High School in Philadelphia.
I had never met him un-til he walk-
ed through that doorway two
weeks ago, but somehow,I knew
him. I knew him even beforehe in-
troduced himself.

Maybe it was the tattered look of a,

 

I, MYERS

man four years in the Navy, or maybe it wasthe ;
confident stride as he entered the room. But more _
than that it was probably the knowing gaze that _

eminated from his eyes as he observed the inner-
workings of a paper he had learned to love; a job
that had become more than an extra-curricular ac-
tivity; a pastime that had become a way of life for
those few fleeting moments when the world was bid-
ing in the future and’ all one had to do was live the
ever-present today. ' -

And it was in that gaze, that knowingview that

what a fateful chain of being I am part of. A chain
of being that each year grows one link longer. A

chain of being thatimprints itself onto your. very,

soul and becomes a part of you for the rest of your
life. « ' .

"Everything seems better after it’s all over,”
commented the former editor prophetically. Some-
how his words rang true in the depths that he ‘felt
them, for I felt that nostalgia too. Maybe it was for
other things at that moment, but has since burned for
a position that has become a part of my life.

And I. look around -me to gauge my. feelings
against the general consensus. I can see that very
little is shared. Much has happened in the past year,
and I’ve learned many things, both about myself and
about the world around-. Many myths have been
shattered. ,

_ I’ve learned that athletics is ‘politics and all is

-money. I’ve_learned that some professional sports

writers are prirrra donas with a flare for sensation-
alism. I’ve found’ that coincidence is an excuse for

incompetence and the real stories rest in the quotes * e

that were never quoted. But most of all I’ve'learned

' how distorted the lilly-bordered picture-fed to the

public really is. _ _ _ _.
Certainly I can’t blame the reporters for dress-

Enthusiasm and {several new twists" high-

lighted Mo_nday’s'opening of spring football drills at
the Stadium. - ' ‘

Student-‘Assistant Coach Dan Lynn stated after_

the two hour workout that “The players seemed
very enthusiastic,” while Assistant Dave-Havern
felt that “It was a bit more spirited than usual.’,’

A switch in coaching assignments was one of
the things different from last season. Coach Bill
Quinter moved from ends to linebackers; Coach

Warren Sipp changed from backfield to ends, ‘while ‘
’ -Coach Paul Kemp moved. from the linebackers to

the offensive backfield.

One of the main reasonsgfor the "realignment is
the shift of Coach Serafino Fazio to full-time re-
cruiter. Though Fazio is assisting head Coach Carl
DePasqua with the defense now, he’ll leave the
coachingranks when a new assistant is hired.

"‘It depends on who we get to fill the position,”

‘wstated DePasqua, “as to the coaching position. We
.won’t be able to get anyone until after spring drills

are over.” _ .
But the change that will cause the greatest ex-

citement" is- the.installation of the [Wishbone type.

offense in the Panthers’ system. Much of the of-
fense’s, time .,was_ delegated to learning the basic
fundamentals of the attack. A '

“They made a lot of mistakes with it,’’’admit-

- ted DePa_squa afterwards, “but overall» they pick-

edit up-fairly well—they were running hard. c

“We ‘don’t have the blazing speed like Okla-
homa did, though we have a little better speed than
last year.,”'con'tinued DePasqua- “Our boys have.

been oriented to a passing game so we’ll probably
. use the pass more than Oklahoma did.” Sophomore

Bob Medwid will be the man who -has

/

to‘ make the
offense tick. -

Aside from the Wishbone, the Panthers’ offense \

will still employ the power-I with most passing
coming from rollouts and play-action passes.
Though last year’s defense yielded approxi-
mately 35‘ points per game in the dismal 3-8 season,
DePasqua intends to stick with the 5-2 defense. my -

Banner’s prediction was ac-

times‘ with jumps of 24-8'1/4, 24- ‘

were: top collegian at the Olym-

Losing and mediocre seasons for most Pitt athletic teams have
been standard fare for the past several years. and certainly the gym-
nastics team has been no excepton. The squad always managed a
few wins against teams such as‘ Slippery Rock and West Virginia.
but proved no match for most of the powers in the Eastern League.

Presently, members of the squad. Coach Warren Neiger and
Assistant Ig Perez are evaluating all aspects of the program in hopes
of lifting Pitt from the doormat status in gymnastics. Their means
of achieving their goals are highly commendable. Open discussions
of problems have occurred between the.parties involved and even
the Athletic Department.

-- - One of the considerations is the situ-
ation with Coach Neiger. To a man. the
gymnasts like Neiger and get along
fine with him. Unlike situations with
other teams and coaches, the gymnasts
seem to lack any dissension problems
with Neiger. truly a fine and friendly
individual.

   

Most gymnasts agree that he is know-
ledgeable about the sport yet has been

“El-LMAN physical developments.
Neiger has a bad back and can't properly hand spot or aid the squad
members with various exercises.

Neiger readily admits his handicap and his feelings of frustra-
tion about it. "I'd like to help more with active spotting. but I've
felt insecure in the past several years. A team has to have a coach
that is very active."

After talking with Coach Neiger at great length, I realized that
he is being torn by two forces—his love of the sport and his desires

I-._\

ympnasts aim for future

unable to genuinely contribute to their’
Unfortunately, ’

everyone though no progress has been made vet ’

 

‘I had been thinking about retiring especially since things

have been going so badly lately,” he said. “When nothing else
seems to work, maybe it's the best thing for the coach to step out.

"I still love the sport and the challenge and enjoy working with
the guys on the team. I hope to take a more active role physically
next year."

Neiger’s credentials merit notice. He began the gym program
here in the early ‘50‘s and had many outstanding teams in the latter
part of the decade. Several Eastern champs have been Pitt graduates
—the last being Lowell Meek in floor exercise in '70 and '71.

Several team members feel that an addition of a full-time assist-
ant coach of high caliber ability would compliment Neiger’s out-
standing organizing and administrative qualities. An ideal situation
perhaps—-but financial reasons might hinder it.

One gymnast told me. “If we didn't like him so much. we
wouldn't care if. he were a sacrificial lamb. But I just don‘t think
we’ll improve if something isn't changed."

Perhaps a replacement for Neiger would be fruitless. The pre-
sent talent may not be capable of a winner under anyone. and fu-
ture teams may be restricted by gymnastics‘ position in the overall
scheme of Pitt athletics.

Conversely, a new face might bring Pitt on par with Penn State
where gym meets attract thousands of students and citizens from

Warriors regain slot

(AP)—Marquette’s controversial basketball team was reinstated
Monday to play in the NCAA tournament.

The NCAA ruled that the Warriors were again eligible to compete

Bob Lackey, the team’s star forward, refused to disclaim reports
thathe was working with agents for a professional contract.

He was among 10 athletes fromsix unnamed institutions who
were asked to sign affidavits to that effect. Lackey was the only one
who balked at the signing Sunday, the NCAA said.
