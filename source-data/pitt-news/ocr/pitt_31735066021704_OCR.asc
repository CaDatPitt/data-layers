Ministers say Georgia
town isn't intolerant
of racial integration

By-John,A. Bolt

Associated Press Writer

CUMMING, Ca. —— A day after
this all-white community was
crammed with up to 25,000
marchers demanding racial toler-
ance, ministers complained that

Cumming had been character-

ized unfairly. _
But a counterdemonstrator,
one of 56 people arrested in the
South's largest civil rights demon-
stration since the 1960s, said he
would work to oust the officials
who welcomed the marchers.
”The politicians and system
stooges are through here,” said
Frank Shirley, Forsyth County
leader of the White Patriot Party,
a militaristic white supremacist
group. L  A
”We’re. going to put our own
candidates in the next election,”

Shirley was quoted as saying in

Sunday’s-'editions of the Forsyth

7 County News.

The marchers had come in

response to a Jan.- 17 attack by a

jeering crowd of 400 Ku Klux
Klansmen and their supporters
who pelted about 75 marchers
with bottles, rocks and mud.

Televised images of that attack
spurred Saturday's huge turnout,
leaving behind some would-be
marchers in Atlanta where more
than 160 charter buses were
filled.

- ’’It looked like Forsyth County
is the worst place in the world to
live and is filled with the most
hateful people,’-’ Rev. Gary
Armes told his Sunday congrega-
tion at theFirst Christian Church.
’’I wanted to shake the TV and
say, ‘That's not so!’ ”

’’It’s a shame that the world

‘cannot know what Forsyth

County is really like,” said Rev.
Butch Franklin of First Baptist
Church. ’

Cumming, a community of
2,800 people that is becoming a
suburb-of Atlanta, was quiet Sun-
day. The last of the marchers had
left town at about 9 p.m. Satur-

Walking along Forbes Avenue on a busy
night amidst loitering students, the smell of
”O—fries ” and the chaotic noise of the city,
one hears the faint sound of a man singing.

Seated on a wooden chair at the corner of
Forbes and Oakland avenues with a cassette-
radio on his lap and a-.can and cup at his feet,

a man sings for anyone who cares to listen in

almost any type of weather. He is blind.

William Allen Dorsey, 37, has been earn-
ing his living this way for the past four years.

Known to the Oakland community as Bill,
he has established many friends here and sings
not only to earn a living but to please others.

”Even if I don't get a donation, as long as
I make someone happy, that is all that mat-
ters,” Dorsey said.

Dorsey said he feels most people are really
friendly, but occasionally he does get harassed
by some kids.

’’I really enjoy talking to people, and I make
a lot of friends out here. I threaten to turn those
that bother me over my knee,” he said.

Born three months premature and weighing

_ only two pounds, Dorsey was placed in an in-

cubator immediately after birth_. In the incu-
bator, his eyes were exposed to too much
oxygen and light which blinded him for life.

Dorsey has learned to manage with his han-
dicap. He lives alone in the Oakland projects
and gets around by jitney, taxi or bus.‘

Dorsey has a 7-year-old son, Darnell Bon-
dine Moore. Darnell is the reason Bill began
singing on the streets.

’’I started out selling potholders, and then
|~ ran out of loops. I needed money to support
him and to put food on the table,’’ he said.
”People told me, ‘we don't want no more
potholders, we just want to hear you sing.’.”

Dorsey has never had a music lesson, but
he loves to sing, and he taught himselfto play
the electrical keyboard. He has performed at
the Graffiti in Shadyside, singing and accom-
panying himself on the keyboard. He also sang
in Carnegie Music Hall last May in a blues H

.COl”lC€l't.

Dorsey can sing almost any type of music
on request. He enjoys singing religious songs
the most but prefers to sing ”standard” songs '
that everyone likes. One of his‘favor~ites is ’’I

Write the Songs” by Barry Manilow. He said i
he avoids certain popular songs which he fears A
may be offensive to some of his listeners, es- ‘

pecially those that are sexually explicit. _

Dorsey himself wrote many of the songs he
sings. He. records himself playing the key-
boards and uses thetapes as background mus-

ic when he sings on the streets. — 

Dorsey said he enjoys singing alone and _
would not like to be a professional singer for
that reas_on. ' ' F t

”No one wants a one-man singer. They want
you in a band, and if you don't do what they
say, that's the end of it,” he said. ”These,days

no one cares about how you feel. All they .

want is to make money.”

Dorsey can be found singing in downtown
Pittsburgh during the day. One of his favorite
places is in front of Parklane Hosiery on Fifth
Avenue. ‘

Dwyer’s conviction sparks debate over pension

HARRISBURG, Pa. — Thurs-
day, state attorneys were inves-
tigating whether to disburse state
Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer’s pen-
sion, while jurors who convicted
him said they were shocked upon
hearing of his suicide.

State Employees Retirement
System attorneys were research-
ing Friday whether the 1978 Pen-
sion Forfeiture Act applies to
Dwyer, said Dale Everhart, assis-
tant executive director of the
department.

The Pension Forfeiture Act pro-
hibits public officials convicted in
office from collecting retirement
benefits. But at least_three con-
victed public officials have suc-
cesfullyo sued to obtain their
pensions despite the law.

The presumed beneficiary of
Dwyer’s pension would be his
wife, Joanne.

Dwyer shot himself.in the head
with a .357 Magnum at a press
conference the day before his
sentencing was scheduled to take
place in U.S. District Court in
Williamsport.

PARIS —- Dozens of armed
men invaded an Ethiopian refu-

and kidnapped 10 members of a
French medical team, a French
medical relief organization said
Saturday.

Medecins Sans Frontieres, or

the four men and six women
from the organization, known as
MSF, were abducted Friday night.

The identity of the kidnappers
was not clear, but the director of
the relief organization, Francis

witnesses they did not intend to
harm their captives. They report-

By Kelley Butt

The Pitt News 0

As the midwinter blahs set in,
many students suffer with severe
cases of ”cabin fever.” In an ef-
fort to avoid roommate flare ups,
students head for the slopes or
the gym to work off some of their
frustrations.

However, sometimes overin—

dulging in too much of a good _
thing results in injury. Casts and '

crutches seem to be par for the
course on campus this winter.
. The increased emphasis on

health and physical fitness has’

lured many people into exercise
programs. The ”weekend ath-
|ete” has not only increased his
overall fitness, he has also added
to the growing number of ”ath—
letic injuries” in this country.
With 1 this
branch of medicine has been de-
veloped specifically to treat these
injuries. Sports medicine, a grow-
ing field in its own right, was

Dr. Freddie Fu, an Orthopedi’c

at the University of Pittsburgh,
said,”Treating injuries is easy; the
key is how they happen and how
to prevent them.”

As team physician for all of
Pitt's athletic teams, 'Fu is in
charge of the athlete's clinical
care, educational programs and
research. A major part of Dr. Fu’s
work stresses the prevention of
injury. -

”lt’s important to get to know
the athletes early on,” said Fu.

injuries can be prevented.”

Liabilitya problern-if

for escort service

By Niki Harrison

-For the Pitt News

l With the surge in crime in Oak-

land, many students feel safer‘

walking home at night with an es-
cort. According to many Pitt stu-
dents, because of the lack of
advertising and inconvenient
operating times of the escort serv-
ices that are offered at Pitt, many
students are forced to walk home
alone and unprotected.

The only organization on cam-
pus currently offering any type of
escort service is the fraternity of
Lambda Chi Alpha. They run
their service Sunday through
Thursday from 7:00 to 12:30.
Although the fraternity has yet to
receive any calls this semester for
escorts, last term they had as
many as two or three per night
during finals. However, the escort
.sevice is not offered late at night
on the weekends.

According to Lambda_Chi Vice
President Ian Lindsay, the\escort
service is not in operation at
those times because of the legal
liability the fraternlityvwould have.

-”We don't want to have the
responsibility for escorting drunk
people home,” Lindsay said.

He also said that the service is
mainly for students who study at
the times that the service is
offered, and unless the demand

picks up, Lambda Chi has no in-

tention of expanding it.

Asked if it was more dangerous _
to walk home sober on a Monday
at 9:30 p.m. or falling-down

drunk at 3 a.m. on a Saturday, .

Lindsay agreed that the Saturday
night would be the most danger-
ous. He also insisted that the
fraternity is indeed concerned
with the welfare of those students
who, after drinking, wish to make
it home safely. '

”We don't let drunk girls leave; »

our parties alone,” he said.

Although there is only one es-
cort service operating now, the
Student Government Board is
now doing preliminary work on
a _student escort service to -be in
operation by the end of the term.

The SGB is looking to get a if

sturdy service. ”We .don’t want A

something that is only going‘ to‘ ‘
last two weeks," said SCB mem-if

ber George .Kontos.

Shuttle program
—it'sworthwhile

Nearly a year ago, the space shuttle exploded, killing all seven

passeng_ers..The country was first shocked, then outraged. We
wondered how the showcase of our government, the space pro-

gram, known for its attention to detail, could have been so hor-'

ribly compromised.
After the expol-sion, there were investigations by the Rogers

I Commission that led to massive resignations in the NASA hi-

erarchy. The commission found that NASA officials had known
about, and ignored, the problems with the 0 rings long before
the launch. We had to wonder whether NASA should be al-

. lowed to continue spending billions of public funds for what

many considered a fruitless venture. I
The Reagan administration decided that the program should
notbe scrapped and allocated money for a replacement shut-
tle. The decision was a good one. -
The space program is an important part of our national ven-

' ' ture. It is a source of much needed world prestige, as well as

an inspiration to us all. . ‘
NASA has set Feb. 18, 1988 as the datefor the first shuttle
launch since the disaster. The safetystandards have been raised,

the decision chains have become less sensitive to time pres-

sures and large parts of the shutt|e’s systems have been
redesigned. In short, the program has been improved.

It is regrettable that it cost us seven lives, a shuttle and two
years of the program to implement these changes, but there
have always been sacrifices in the pursuit of flight. Consider

' the hot-air baloons, the zeppelins, even the airplane. Not“ every

danger can be foreseen, nor can every'danger be .alleviated.
. All the people in the space program realize that they are tak-
ing achance with their lives in every new flight. They choose

l '- tortake those risks in the interest of expansion of technology.

Theirmemory would be best‘served not by scrapping the pro-
gram, but by continuing to work for the goals they were will-

  Wade

Last week was marked by the 14th anniversary. of the
monumental Roe vs. Wade decision. Since the decision, there
has been much controversy between the pro-life and pro-choice

‘ I factions.

-This decision islboth sound and sane. _
It IS an individual’s right to do as he or she chooses with his

 j .- ‘or her own body. The state does not have the right to press
 its chosen morality upon the individual citizen.

The Roe vs. Wade decision stipulates that a woman has the

I‘ ‘ right to abort a fetus within the first six months of the gestation

period. The end ofthe second trimester was chosen as the point
at which an individual life begins because, ‘after six months,

. the fetus can function independent of the mother's body.

‘When considering the problem of legalized abortion, perhaps

 we should look at the reality of the situation. For many years

prior to the Roe vs. Wade decision, abortions were performed

' illegally — often with unsanitary conditions that .threatened the

lives of the mothers. If in reaction to increasing pressure from
the pro-life faction the decision should be reversed, illegal abor-
tions will‘ continue to be performed, and those of the pro-life

faction will have to concern themselves not only with the life .

of eélch fetus but also’with”the life of each‘ mother.

THE PITT News, Monday, January 26, I987

 

Memories of other disasters are just asvivid  

The date of Jan. 28 is coming
up, and when it gets here none
of us will be likely to ignore it.
Jan. 28 is the first anniversary of
the day the space shuttle
Challenger exploded, killing the
seven astronauts aboard. On that
day this year, the newspapers and
television broadcasts will be
filled with replays of last year's
tragedy. . '

In years to come, that pattern
is likely to repeat itself. Journal-
ism has a fascination with an-
niversaries, and the Challenger
explosion hit so many Americans
in such a hard, visceral way that
we are likely tobe reminded of
it on every Jan. 28 for the rest of
our lives. .

Sheryl Tarkoff has been think-
ing about that. Tarkoff, 36, is
awaiting Jan.’ 28, too,_ but for a
different reason. a

”My father died last Jan. 28,”
she said. ”His name was Sydney
Slone, and he was 71 years old,
and he died during heart surgery
that evening. The rest of the
world was mourning. the Chal-
lenger astronauts, but I was
mourning for my father.”

Are they

At times, this is an ugly world.

Fathers batter children and chil-
dren batter fathers. Teenagers
drive drunk until felling trees with
their front bumpers. Pilots fly
from airports after lining their
noses with cocaine.

People kill people. a _ .

And sometimes people kill
themselves. _

R. Budd Dwyer killed himself
last Thursday morning. He called
a news conference in his Harris-
burg office, and rather than resign
as state treasurer as many expect-
ed, he drew a .357-caliber Mag-
'num revolver from a Manila
envelope, stuffed the barrel into

his mouth and pulled the trigger. _

Dauphin County Coroner Wil-
liam B. Bush pronounced Dwyer
dead at the scene. _

The news directors of three lo-
cal television stations -— KDKA,
WTAE and WPXI — watched the
entire suicide as it was transmit-
ted by satellite. It was within an
hour of noon, and'their consent
was requiredto show the video-

Once upon a time, there was
a public official named Budd
Dwyer. Budd decided,,for rea-
sons beyond the grasp of most of
us, to choose the public spotlight‘
as the best place to kill himself.
He assembled the minions of the
press, ‘gave a rambling speech
declaring his innocence and en-
larged his oral cavity before the
stunned reporters.

Why?

Did he want to draw our atten-
tion? He,did that. Did he want to
shock the public at large? He did
that. Did he want to gain our
respect? He did not do that.

To my mind, the whole affair
was a carefully engineered at-
tempt to ‘manage the news. He
knew that the pictures of him
with the gun would be smeared
across the pages of the state-
newspapers, and he _more than
likely hoped that the_T.\'/ news

In the year that has passed
since then, Sheryl Tarkoff has
‘reflected on how she will feel on
thislan. 28, and on every Jan. 28
from now on. Sydney Slone was
not a famous man, and yet she
knows that when every Jan. 28
comes around, he will be the
only man on her mind.

”When a 71-year-old man goes
in for heart surgery, we hope for

_the best,” she said. ”When the

space shuttle goes up, we hope
for the best. I guess in both cases
we know in the backs of our
minds that something can go
wrong. But that doesn't help pre-
pare us for it.”

She said that in the days follow-
ing last Jan. 28, while the nation
tried to shake off its shock over
the Challenger explosion, she
was doing the same thing in a
more personal way. '

”At first I just wanted to sit in
my chair and cry," she said.
”That’s all I feltlike doing, every
day. I would do the things I had
to do: make breakfast for the chil-
dren, clean the house, make din-
ner. It felt like it was a different

’person.doing it. It was my body
doing it, but it was like I wasn't
in my body. I kept telling myself,

’If I just keep doing normal

things, I'll become normal again.’
”And that has happened. I can
look at a picture of my father now
and not fall apart. I can think of
things he said and laugh.
”That’s what has been going
through my mind as I get ready
for Jan. 28 to come this year. I
know that the explosion of the
space shuttle was a national
tragedy, and the death of my
father on the operating table was

' not.

”But to be honest, the loss of
the people on the Challenger
shuttle did not change my life.
The loss of my father did. The ex-
plosion of the Challenger was a

moment in history. I will remem— '

ber it because I was alive at the
time. It didn't change my life,
though.

”When my father died, the
most positive influence in my life
was gone. My dad was a man
who was able to say to*people,
‘You look wonderful. I love you.’
My father was never afraid to give
any one of us a hug or a kiss or
to say, ’I’m proud of you.’

”It’s funny the things you
remember. When we were very
little he used to play a game with
us. He would hold us up by our
ankles, with our heads near the
floor. We'd stiffen our bodies and
put our arms by our sides. Then
he'd lift us up higher into the air,
and we'd collapse laughing "

Sydney Slone worked three
different jobs during his life. He
was in the auto parts business, the
jewelry business and the real es-
tate business. He never attained

tape on the 12 o'clock newscasts.
All three ran the footage, but-
KDKA and WTAE stopped the
tape as Dwyer lifted the gun to
his mouth.

Only WPXI provided its au-
dience with the suicide in its en-
tirety. A bold move,‘.for certain.
I didn't see it, but those who did
described a nauseatingnewsreel
of a 48-year-old man shooting

‘ himself through the head. .
Anyone who saw the unedited
» footage on WPXI was able to see

the world as it is, and anyone
who watched KDKA or WTAE
watched what was consideredto
be in good taste, as if those words
could be applied to a suicide in
a roomful of" reporters.

By Williams, news operations
manager at WPXI, said the station
received 42 negative phone calls
during its noon news. At 6 and 11
p.m., WPXI, like its competitors,
halted the tape short of the actu-
al suicide. 8

Too bad. . 

It is unfortunate, but unavoid-

macabre incident into the living-

rooms of millions of viewers. The 4
media, because it had no other

choice, complied.

In the wake of the incident, we
were left with a vacant treasurer’s
office and a question about how
much of the news the media is re-
quired to present. They should
present it all, some will argue, let
the people decide how much
gore they would like to see.

That argument simply does not
apply to" this situation.

There are comparisons to past
violent events being thrown
around like grenades in the de-
bate. We saw the space shuttle
raining all over the Atlantic. We
saw JFK’s assasination. We were
subjected to endlessjre-runs of
the attempt on the president's life.

were able to learnmore about

able, that we must entrust three
news directors with the determi-
nation of what we can see and
what we cannot see on the tele-
vision news. They play God three
times daily, scanning videotape
and making decisions about what
isaappropriate to show the million
or so people that comprise. the
Pittsburgh market.

It is a tremendous responsibili-
ty. They must translate a compli-
cated world into simple pictures
and words, taking everything’ that
happened since the previous
newscast and making it fit on a
Te|ePrompTer scroll.

This is their job. It is not their

MATTHEW
THORNTON

COUNTERPOINT

Inspection of the events allows
us to see exactly what happened.
The footage was shown to
describe an important event. It
was not shown to examine the
blood, the horrified lookon a
man's face or the darker side of
reality.

The case of Mr. Dwyer was no
further illuminated in the light of
the gore we saw.

But again, why?

Why did one TV station in the
city decide to show the entire
footage on one broadcast and
then cut it for later sequences?

Why do we find that the peo-

ple who -saw the entire film’ are -

the State Finance Building is a
public place and, conceivably,
anyone who wanted to could

have wandered in and watched ;

the news conference. About 40
showed, mostly members of the
media, hardly expecting Dwyer
to take his life. But that's what

happened. A public official com?

mitted suicide in a public place.

That was the news.

And that should have been
shown on television.

WPXI should be congratulated '

for showing the news as it truly
happened. ”If you are .at all
squeamish, we advise you not to
watch,” the anchor warned be-
fore rolling the tape, giving the
audience chance enough to exit
the room or switch the channel
or stare into the television set and
witness an actual suicide. _The
suicide was sickening. The video-
tape was sickening. But the view-
ers had the choice of watching it
for themselves. -

' The other stations usurped the
freedom of choice by not allow-

Why is it even an issue?

Why do we care?

To the partof the population
not interestedin watching a man
kill himself,.there is nothing but
relief. Happily, most of the Pitts-
burgh stations did not show the
entire event. We were told that
Budd Dwyer had‘ killed himself at
a press conference. We were
shown film of the speech he
made before‘ pulling the trigger.
We were told the whole story.

If a person were to die in a fire,
that would be news. The pictures
of a burned and dead body
would not be news. Such photos
would tell no more of the story,
would not further clarify a point
easily made in words.

If a newscaster were to come
on the screen and present a
graphic description of a rape vic-
tim, with completejdescriptions

of which parts of the body had .
been mutilated, and show, we-.‘

”But every person is famous to
somebody, or should be,” Tarkoff
said. ”To his family, and his
friends, my father brought a

tremendous spirit and happiness. _

He touched people.

”I know that on Jan. 28, not too
many people will be thinking
about my dad. Some people's

‘lives make big headlines. My

father's life was not a headline.
His life was a pinprick, a little
dot. I realize that.

”But on that day last year, our-

little world blew up, too, in its
own way. And when that day
comes this year, I'll watch TV and
read the newspapers. And I'll
think: This is the day my father
died. It was the day the shuttle ex-
ploded, too. But this is the day
my father died.“ . ‘

’’It really is in the planning
stages. We're starting from
scratch,” said Kontos.

The SGB is currently talking to
other universities, and they're
hoping to find an escort system
that Pitt can~adopt. Because of the
university's urban location, Kon-
tos said, finding one that will
work for Pitt is difficult.

Kontos agreed that the univer-
sity is really in need of a good es-
cort service, and that is why the
SGB is putting such an effort into
this project. The board is hoping
to form a separate committee or
student orgaization that will run
the service.

Pitt athletes. aren't the only
ones to benefit from Dr. Fu’s at-
tention. Last fall, Fu noticed that
orthopedic services simply weren't
offered at the Student Health
Center.

He began to volunteer one
hour per week to see students.
Pitt students now have relatively
easy access to an orthopedic sur-
geon. According to Fu, patients in
his Falk Clinic office could wait
approximatelyvtwo months for an
appointment.

This sometimes makes the
week long for Fu, but he doesn't
seem to mind. ‘'1 see an average
of 150 patients and perform 15
surgeries a week. Other team
doctors treat 50 to 60 players.
Here at Pitt,'l see 492 kids, but
I wouldn't trade Pitt for
anything.”

Along with the development of
the new medical‘ specialty, the
popularity of sports clinics has
also risen. The Sports and Preven-
tive Medicine-Institute of Pitts-
burgh was ‘established. in May,
1986 as a joint effort between the
University of Pittsburgh and Pres-
byterian University Hospital, ac-
cording to its director, Jay Irrgang.

”The clinic offers three areas of

focus: clinical, educational and

research,” said Irrgang. ”Trained
physical therapists _and athletic
trainers work with the injured
athlete to reduce pain and in-
crease strength in the clinical
area." , 1

Many injuries incurred while
playing sports happen to those
body parts exposed. “Sixty per-
cent of the sports problems are

’ knee injuries,” said Irrgang. Then
, follows the shoulders, neck, back

andfoot." .
Although the clinic specializes
in _the treatment of athletes, the

injured worker can also benefit *
- from the clinic.

The clinic's future expansion
plans include: a hand clinic, ex-
ercise testing and a cardiac re-
habilitation center. When
Presbyterian University Hospital
has completed its expansion, the
Sports and Preventive Medicine
Institute will occupy space within
the hospital. ‘’

THE PlTT NEWS, Monday, January 26, 1987

By Sandy Johnson

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — En-
couraged by President Reagan
and undeterred by heavy
snow, abortion foes gathered
Friday to protest the 14th an-
niversary of the Supreme
Court's landmark decision
legalizing abortion.

Reagan told an estimated
2,000 demonstrators, gathered
in a park near the White
House, ”Abortion is not a
harmless medical procedure
but the taking of the life of a
living human being. This trag-
ic and terrible toll continues at
a rate of more than 4,000
young lives lost each day.

”Our national commitment
to the dignity of all human life
must begin with respect for the
most basic civil right, the right
to life,” the president said via
telephone hookup.

After Reagan's speech, the
marchers, hampered by six
inches of snow, began their
trek along Pennsylvania
Avenue to the Supreme Court.

' The president said his ad-
ministration had worked to
’ restrict federal funds for abor-
tions and told the protestors:

”Your' prayers and your hard

. work have brought us a long

way since the tragedy of 1973,

and together, with God's help,

we will finish the task and heal
our wounded nation.”

« Reagan was challenged by
the anti-abortion leaders to

veto legislation that purported-
ly provides, federal funds for V

/\/Iarchers protest
against abortion

upwards of 10,000 abortions
annually in the District of
Columbia. '

”l’|l get right on that right
away to see what can be
done,” Reagan said.

White House spokesman
Larry Speakes, when asked
whether the president would
veto the bill, replied, ”We can
certainly look into it, but l
don't know the status of it.”
Asked whether the president's
staff would recommend a
veto, he said, ”We will just
have to wait and see.”

U.S. Park Police estimated
the crowd at 2,000. A year ago
the march drew 37,000 peo-
ple; in 1985, it drew 71,000.

Meanwhile, a coalition of

pro-choice groups noted their
‘ recent -victories at the ballot

box —— referenda that would
have restricted abortions were
defeated in four states and
several actively anti-abortion
senators lost re—election. The
groups released a list of 300
fake abortion clinics_ around
the country that they charged
with harassing pregnant
women.

”Very often these centers
use the wrath of God to intimi-
date women,” said Fredrica
Hodges, director of the Reli-

J gious Coalition for Abortion

Rights.

On Wednesday, Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin, head of the
Catholic bishops’ Pro-Life
Committee, appealed to Con-
gress to ’.’prevent abortion
from becoming enshrined as a
civil right.”

One year later: space shuttle
controversy raises questions

Combined News Services

Christa McAuliffe came to
Cape Canaveral full of excite-
ment for the adventure she called
”the ultimate field trip.” No
teacher, she said, had ever been
more prepared for just two les-
sons. ‘'1 just hope everyone tunes
in on Day 4 to watch the teacher
teaching from space,” she said.

On Day 4, with the nation in
mourning, Navy men were skim-
ming the remains of the space
shuttle Challenger from the Atlan-
tic Ocean and came across a few
pages of the lessons the teacher
never got to teach.

A second grade pupil in Che-
vy Chase, Md., brought to school
an explanation. of the accident,
that said: ”The space shuttle ex-
ploded in the sky because there
was a leak and all the space peo-
ple died when the space ship ex-
ploded.”

Also on that day, when mil-
lions of children in classrooms all
over the world had planned to
tune in on
Challenger, they watched instead
a eulogy being delivered in
Houston by President Reagan.

”The future is not free,” he.

said. ”The story of all human
progress is one of struggle against
all odds. We learned again that
this America, which Abraham
Lincoln called the last, best hope
of man on Earth, was built on
heroism and noble sacrifice.”

It was built, he said, by the likes
of Dick Scobee, Mike Smith, El-
lison Onizuka, Judy Resnik, Ron
McNair, Greg Jarvis__and Christa
McAuliffe —- men and women
”who answered a call beyond
duty, who gave more than was
expected or required and who
gave it little thought of worldly
reward.”

ed after 73 seconds of flight on

But around the country, school-
children, gathering around TVs,
cheered when the shuttle lifted
off and did its majestic roll, then
cried out in horror when it was
engulfed in a fearsome white and
orange fireball. Before the day
was over, hundreds of millions of
people had seen replays of the
scene.

The shock that followed the ex-
plosion was not hard to explain.
To Americans, space flight was a
matter-of-fact. It had been going
on, after all, for a quarter century.

On the day of the accident, pi-
oneering astronaut John Glenn
himself commented: ”This is the
«day that NASA has been postpon-
ing for 25 years.”

But was it an accident? Or was
it the tragic culmination of a can-
do agency gone sloppy and mak-
ing compromises to meet an in-
creasingly ambitious schedule
with its four-orbiter shuttle fleet?

Reagan, found troubling lapses in
judgment, expertise, communica-
tions and management. It called
the Challenger explosion ”an ac-
cident rooted in history” and said
the agency had accepted growing

risks ”because they got away,

with it the last time.”

The direct cause of the explo-
sion was a leak at a joint between
segments of one of two booster
rockets that provide 80 percent of
the power to push the orbiter into
space. Superheated gases shot
through that leak toward the ad-
jacent fuel tank and triggered the
conflagration.

Some NASA managers had
feared for years that trouble
lurked in the huge rockets. As
early as 1977, an engineer at NA-
SA’s Marshall Space Flight Center
in Alabama warned superiors that
the rocket designed by Morton
Thiokol, Inc., was unacceptable

and that two quarter-inch di-

ameter O-rings intended to seal

Taxi, -car
collide on
Fifth Ave.

A taxi crashed into a bus shelter
at the corner of Bigelow
Boulevard and Fifth Avenue last
night.after colliding with another
car, according to Pittsburgh
Police.

Heather Kugsmith, 17, attempt-
ed to make a left turn from the
center lane on Fifth Avenue, a
police report said, and collided
with a taxi in the left lane.

The taxi, a Yellow Cab driven
by Carl Cole, 64, veered off the
road and onto the William Pitt
Union lawn, knocking over the
bus shelter. The left rear door of
the cab was apparently torn off in
the impact. ’

Both Cole and the cab’s pas-

senger, whose name police

would not release, sustained
minor injuries. They were treat-
ed for bruises and abrasions by an
ambulance at the scene, accord-
ing to police.

under pressure.

The worst case had been on a
mission almost exactly a year be-
fore Cha|lenger’s when O-ring
damage occurred in both rocket
boosters. A backup O-ring, the
|ast—ditch ‘defense against burn-
through, showed the effect of
heat. That Jan. 24, 1985, liftoff
had taken place when the tem-
perature was 53 degrees at the
launch site, the coldest to date.

The Challenger launch was to
take place after a night when tem-
peratures were forecast to be in
the low 20s, and Thiokol en-
gineers
postponed. _

In the end, Thiokol bosses
overruled their engineers and
gave NASA the go-ahead. The
Rogers Commission said Thiokol
acted under pressure from NASA.

The men who made the final
decision to launch say they knew
none of this —-' not about the sus-
pect O-rings, not about the histo-
ry of leaks and not about the
launch-eve argument.

But the Rogers Commission
disputed that. The O-ring history,

argued that it be

     

presented to the top level at
NASA headquarters in August
1985, ”was sufficiently detailed
to require corrective action prior
to the next flight,” the commis-
sion said. -

It concluded that: ”The space
shuttle’s solid rocket booster
problem began with the faulty de-
sign of its joint and increased as
both NASA and contractor
management first failed to recog-
nize it as a problem, then failed
to fix it and finally treated it as an
acceptable flight risk.”

The commission also deter-
mined that NASA was under too
much pressure to launch and was
stretching its capabilities to the
limit in scheduling 15 flights for
1986.

While the space agency scram-
bled to satisfy nine major recom-
mendations made by the
commission, shuttle operations
were stopped. The first post-
Challenger flight is scheduled for
Feb. 18, I988.

The agency was shaken up. A
new administrator took over to
replace an acting chief who had
the misfortune of being at the
helm at the wrong time. A new
shuttle program director —— an ex-
perienced astronaut —— came
aboard.

There were wholesale resigna-
tions and shifting of duties in the
top ranks at the Marshall Space
Flight Center, which deals with
propulsion systems, and at Mor-
ton Thiokol, lnc., which built the
boosters. The directors of the
Kennedy and Marshall centers re-
tired, and the head of the John-
son Space Center — who had
approved the Challenger launch
— took a leave of absence.

The spouses and children of as-
tronauts Scobee, Onizuka, Jarvis
and McAuliffe made financial set-
tlements with the government
and Morton Thiokol that are
reported to be atleast $1 million

each. The family of Smith, having I

been rejected in a $15.1 million
claim against-the government, is
free to sue if current negotiations
break down. The Smith and Res-
nik families are still talking with
thejustice Department. McNair’s
family is suing Morton Thiokol.

After mulling it over for six
months, President Reagan agreed
to a $2.8 billion replacement for
Challenger. At the same time, he
ordered the space agency out of
the business of launching com-

A mercial satellites and said private

industry should be encouraged to
do so.

Two billion dollars worth of
scientific programs were put on
hold, including the $1 billion
Hubble Space Telescope, the
most ambitious scientific ‘space
project to date, and the space
probes that were to have been
sent in 1986 toward Jupiter and
the sun.

Ten astronauts, unwilling to-

wait for a renewal of fewer flights,
resigned from the corps or were

reassigned to other duties. NASA .

and .its contractors laid off thou-
sands of workers.

Pete Conrad, who commanded
the second mission on the moon,
says NASA will learn from the ac-
cident and will be better than
ever when flights resume.

‘ ”| used to.tell my crewmates
that I don't worry about what has
gone wrong,” said Conrad. ”Peo—
ple are focusing on that and fix-
ing it. What I worry about is what

Giants beat Denver 39-20, win first Bowl

PASADENA, Calif. — Phil

Back on tack 

Panthers
down BC,
80-62

By Thomas Danyluk

Assistant Sports Editor

BOSTON — Boston Col-
lege's Golden Eagles, even un-
der coach Jim O'Brien,
typically have a lot of determi-
nation and desire on the court
— you know, Doug Flutie-type
players. Against Pitt on Satur-
day ‘night, it wasn't nearly
enough as the Panthers ran off
with a 80-62 victory in the
Boston’ Garden. 3

”This team is, by far, the
most difficult for us to match
up against, and that includes
Syracuse,” said O'Brien./’We
executed things well tonight,
but they've got good individu-
al talent. That was the
difference.” V - _

Consider this stat: Of Pitt's
22 shot attempts in the second
half, only eight were taken
outside of the key. That, after
brief interpretation, simply
means the Panthers pounded
Boston College down low,
where the buffaloes roam.

_BC’s big men verus Pitt's big-

ger men was a. mismatch.
Pitt led by only one at the
14:26 mark_of the first half, but
after a Jerome. Lane rebound
and feed to Demetreus Gore
ended ‘in a ”take that, you
overachievers ” dunk “—- the

pace was set, and the Panthers

went into the locker room
leading 33-25.»

Pitt's frontcourt, of Smith,
Lane, Goreand Rod Brookin
did a fine job in controlling the
paint. The four combined for
53 points and put the clamps
on the Eagles" inside game.
Smith’, who had 18 points,_
dished out six blocks and
made Eagle penetrators think
twice before going to the
basket.

’’I’m always gonna play
hard on defense,” Smithsaid.
”|’ve got an edge in there. I
can check my man and do
pretty much what I want
inside.”

Added Evans, ”Those blocks
really hurt them tonight. They
allowed us to get into our tran-
sition game. It just showed that
-we're at our best when we're
playing.good defense.” _
What concerned’ Evahs most

 

the two quarterbacks in this
game, completed 22 of 25 for
268 yards, including three touch-
down passes, and was unani-
mously voted the Most Valuable
Player.

He also set a Super Bowl
record with 10 straight comple-
tions during New York's second-
half tear. His 88 percent comple-
tion rate was an NFL playoff
record.

Senior guard Curtis Aiken launchs a jumper in the face of Jamie Benton (No. 11).

going into the game was stop- ‘
ping Dana Barros, BC’s point
guard. The 5-10 Barros was
coming off a magnificent per- '
formance against Seton Hall
on Tuesday, scoring 30 points
and pulling five rebounds.
”He played the game of his
life against Seton Hall,” said
Evans. ’’I knew if he played
like that tonight, we'd be in
trouble.”

' So Pitt threw several
defenses at Barros, including
an effective box-and—one that

hanging on him -like a scarf.

Most of this came after a first
half in which Denver outplayed
the heavily favored Giants, going
off with a 10-9 lead that easily
could have been 20-7 or 20-9.
Early in the second quarter, New
York held Denver without a point

goal from their 1 and Rich Karlis
missed field goals from 24 and 34
yards for Denver, one after that
goal-line stand.

came in the frantic f-irst
minutes, when the crowd dic-
tated the tempo. Overall, he
couldn’t bail them outof this
one by himself.

”He’s the key to their
team,” Evans remarked.
”They’re counting on him to

do more than he's probably

capable of doing. He's a great
player, but Mike d_id a good

job on him tonight.”

Most of the second half
seemed to be stuck in neutral.
Pitt surged ahead by 14, and
Boston College mounted a few

‘mini-comebacks, pulling to

with_in nine. But Smith and

. check with crucial foul shoot- .

_ John's game.

So dominant was Elway in that
period that he accounted for 200
yards on his own — 187 passing
and 13 rushing. That was 13
yards more than Denver's total
offense when sacks are figured in.

Then came the third quarter, in
which the Giants, who outgained
the Broncos by 163 yards to 2,
scored 17 points. From the time
the Broncos led 10-9 until the Gi-
ants led 33-10, Denver was held

By Hal Bock

AP Sports Writer

PASADENA, Calif. — Denver's
ground game had its chance and
when the Bronco ‘runners came
up short on first-and-goal from the
New York Giants’ 1—yard line it
was essentially their last opportu-
nity in the Super Bowl.

With the Broncos ahead 10-7
arid driving downfield on ‘quarter-. '
back John Elway’s passing, Den-

ver moved to New York's 1 early. .. -4:
s in the second quarter Sunday, they.-,‘j.,,l;?.i.

Giants threw Elway for a one-yard
loss, stopped Gerald Willhite for
no gain and then threw Sammy
Winder for a four-yard loss.
When Rich Karlis missed" a
23-yard field goal attempt, Coach ‘
Dan Reeves turned the ball over,

‘ to Elway almost entirely.- ‘

Elway attempted 23 consecu-
tive pass plays before he got a
running call from the bench mid-
way through the fourth quarter. ’

. By then, New York led 33-10.and

this Super Bowl was essentially
over. V .

Reeves defended the three
straight running plays in the first-
and-goal situation.

”Those were the plays we‘-

called and we thought they were 1: 1

good plays,” he said. _”Th_ey are

not an easy team to get into the.  

end zone against. The first play_L[:  :
was a sweep with an extra block-S, jj
er to clear the guy to the corner“;
and a fullback and guard coming’ 
around. That should be in (th_e‘°_(_i 
end zone). We felt good about 

the play and__ they wiped it out.
”Then they threw us for alossf

when we came back and ran a

trap up the middle and they

stopped that. Then we ran a 
sweep on third down they f.

stopped us.”

Elway understood these-

’ quence of calls.
”On the 2-yard line, throwing "

down there is tough,” he said. ’’I

felt ‘I did everything I could.

That's all I can ask of myself.
’’It was very disappointing, but

in the first half we just didn't get 5 -

into the end zone and after that

when we fell behind we had to ”

keep throwing.”

New York linebacker Carl
Banks, who made-the tackle on“
the key third down in the goal-
line.stand, said that series was af
big turnaround in the game.‘

”Danny was great,” Kansas

Manning scored 16 points in

Jayhawks.

”I had a good game," Manning

”We wanted to come in here

”This is out of conference, but it
means a lot because it's on na-

The Wolfpack made just 28

North CaroIina'State, trailing
39-31 at halftime, missed six of
its first seven shots to start the sec-
ond half and fell behind 53-42
with 9:52 left in the game.

Manning started the Jayhawks’

lead by hitting a turnaround jump
shot. He ended a 8-2 Kansas
streak, by rebounding a missed
North Carolina State shot and
feeding Keith Harris for a fast-
break layup.

‘Rome’: Pitt's second force in the Lane

By Thomas Danyluk

Assistant Sports Editor

BOSTON — A reading from
the Book of Trite Sayings.

”What goes up must come
down.”

Footnote: And when the
”what” is a misfired basketball,
Jerome Lane is usually around to
make gravity’s Job a lot easier.

Lane, with his strength and
speed, is a well-blended hybrid
of an irresistable force and an im-
movable object. The 6-6 forward
is currently the country’s leading
rebounder, grabbing over 13

Despite being only a sopho-
more, he’s become quite notori-.-
ous among Panther opponents,
including Boston College coach,
Jim O'Brien. 

”He’s really intimidating. The
guy knows how to get good po-
sition, then uses his strength to
control the rebound,” said
O'Brien. ”He’s one of the best
we'll see. Or will see.”

In Pitt's win over the Eagles on
Saturday, Lane turned in his 16th
”double-double” of the season —
12 rebounds along with 18
points.

Yet, aside from his consistent
output, perhaps the most appeal-
ing aspect of his play is his unself-
ishness, his humbleness. Never
flashy — unless the Lane is clear
for take-off into the Jamosphere
— his only goal is to help the
team churn out a victory, and
make his teamates look good.

”Whatever coach [Evans]
wants me to do — rebound,
shoot, play defense — it doesn't
matter to me. Just as long as we
score more points than they do,’.’
Lane remarked. ”Since I rebound
hard, it takes the pressure off

ledge, the second-string quarter-
back, came up behind the center.

The ball was snapped, and Rut-
ledge sn_uck for 1 yard and a first
down.

Six plays later, Simms hit tight
end Mark Bavaro for -13 yards,
the Giants led 16-10 and the rout
was on.

Denver, which went the entire
third quarter without calling a
running play, went 1-2-3-punt,
and the punt was returned 25
yards by Phil McConkey to the
Denver 36. Eight plays later, Raul
Allegre’s 21-yard field goal made
it 19-10.

Again Denver went 1-2-3-punt,

and again New York scored, go-
ing 68 yards in four plays with Joe
Morris running over from 1 yard
out following a 44-yard flea-

'flicker pass from Simms to

McConkey.

Elvis Patterson intercepted an
Elway pass the next time, setting
up a 6—yard scoring pass from
Simms to McConkey. The ball
bounced off tight end Mark

Bavaro’s hands and helmet, right ‘

into the hands of McConkey,
who did a victory dance and ran
off the field with the ball.

This was the fifth time in six

. years that an NFC team has won

the Super Bowl. The last AFC
team was the Los Angeles Raid-

ers in 1984. The Giants won their
three postseason games by a to-
tal score of 105-23, beating San

Francisco 49-3 and Washington .

17-0 en route to their first NFL ti-
tle since 1956.

From then on it was garbage
time. Ottis Anderson had a 1-yard
TD run for New York. Karlis had
a 29-yard field goal for Denver,
and Elway threw 46 yards to
Vance Johnson for a consolation
TD late in the game.

It didn't start that‘ way.

Denver took a 3-0 lead on the
first possession of the game on
Karlis’ 48-yard field goal.

Elway was the prime mover on
the drive, scrambling 10 yards for

THE PITT. NEWS, Monday, January 26, 1987

 

a first down on the first play, then
hitting Mark Jackson for 24 yards
on a third-and-7 from his own 39.

But the Giants came right back,
with a 78-yard, 9-play drive on
which Simms went 6-for-6 for 69
yards. It culminated with his
6—yard toss to Zeke Mowatt with
5:27 left in the quarter.

Then it was Denver's turn."

The Broncos moved 58 yards
in six plays to set up Elway’s
4-yard TD run on a quarterback
draw with 2:06 left in the quarter.

The first quarter ended with the
two quarterbacks a combined 13
for 13. Elway was 6-for-6 for 68
yards and Simms 7-for-7 for 76
yards.

Continued from page 9 ‘

’’It was a momentum—builder
for us,” he said. ’’It demoralized
them. They take pride in their
short-yardage, goal-line offense.
When they went away from the
run, it was a tribute to our
defense. We closed the off-tackle
hole and made them go up the
middle, but when he's throwing,
that's a lot of pressure, too. We
survived, though.”

Of Elway’s 304 yards passing,
187 came in the first half, but
only 13 in the third quarter, when
the game turned.

”The difference was that our
pass defense was lopsided in the
first half,” Banks said. ”We ad-
justed at halftime.”

”They gave us thir best shot in
the first half,” Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor said. ”John had
us snake—bit for a while.”

Taylor said he was not sur-
prised at the Broncos’ pass—run ra-
tio, which included only 19
rushes in the game.

’’l was surprised they ran as
much as they did,” he said.
”When they run, at least you
know where it (the ball) is. When

.John drops back, it's a double

play because he can run or he
can throw. That's their best
offense.”

That offense, however, did not
work on Super Sunday.

the team's better‘ performances.
”We weren't as ready for this
meet as I would have like to have
been,” said Ligouri. .

In the first two events of the
meet, the Lady Panthers appeared
determined to reach their goal of
a 180 score. Pitt junior Kim Cal-'
derone placed first on vault with
a 9.15, followed by teammates’
Trish Aser, Alisa Spector and Lee

a score of 9.2, which was close-
ly followed by Vaughn’s 9.15.
Lady Panther junior Cathy Cole-.
man tied Bev Fry of West Virginia
for third place with a score of 9.0.

Pitt and West Virginia had their
troubles on the beam, however.
The Lady Panthers only compet-
ed in three out of six routines,
and some of those routines were
not solid. » .

However, freshman Shelly
Sleith did place first with a score
of 8.85 and Spector placed se-
cond with a 8.75.

On floor, Pitt's final event, the
Lady Panthers took the top two

places. Aser danced through a‘

 

clean floor routine and took top
honors with a score of 8.95.
Waters displayed innovative
choreography and placed second
with a 8.9. . g

In the all-around competition,

"Spector took third place, as the

top two awards went to West

Virginia.

The victory over West Virginia
improved the Lady Panthers’
record to 2-1, and the meet was
Pitt's third" in eight days. The
previous weekend, Pitt compet-
ed at the University of New
Hampshire and the University of
Rhode Island.

Pitt lost to New Hampshire by
a score of 173.4 to. 170.45, but
won over Rhode Island the next

The undefeated Pitt men's
swim team brought down the
Penn State Nittany Lions-in a
grudge match this past
weekend by a score of 129-88.

Thevictory was a very sweet
one for the Panthers as they
remembered the 61-52 loss‘
they suffered to the Nittany
Lions last season.

Pitt has trained all season

Panther sophomore Scott
Jeffries was impressed with his
teammate’s performance.
”Monte was just amazing out
there. He showed -a lot of
guts,” said Jeffries. ,

Senior Tom Shaulinski and
freshman Tim Adams also en-
joyed wins in three events for
Pitt. — ’

The victory clearly belonged »
to the Panthers after the diving
competition. Junior Chris Blair
dominated the competition,
taking first place on both the
one- -_ and three—meter boards,
while senior Jack Shuten and

were also consistent, taking se-_
cond and third places on both
boards respectively. '
”Penn State's top diver was
out because of an injury, but

dives this past weekend that I
was really comfortable with. I
was "pleased with my perfor-
mances on both boards.”

lowich decided to swim the rest
of the events as exhibition so not
to run up the score.

”We swam extremely well,
and they didn’t,” said Belowich.
”WVU had some swimmers
missing from their line—up
though, due to illness and in-
juries. '

”We won against them in the
double-dual meet in December,
but in this meet we completely
dominated. I'm very happy with
the performances we gave in the
meet. We've come a longway
from where we were in De-
cember." ‘ ‘

One of the reasons Pitt was
able to excel on Saturday was the
outstanding performances of
some freshmen. Laure Walczak
had her best meet of the season,
posting four first-place finishes for
the Panthers in the 100-yard
freestyle, 100-yard butterfly,
200-yard medley relay and the
200-yard freestyle relay. '

Other commendable ‘perfor-
mances by freshmen included:
Sandy Albright, who won both

the 100- and 200-yard back- ‘

strokes and Terri Ziegler, "who
won the 50-yard freestyle for the
first time this season.
Sophomore Lorraine Guibord,
a member of _the winning
200-yard freestyle relay team
reflected on the meet. ’’I had no
doubt that we would win the
meet. The competition was basi-
cally within our team,” said
Guibord. ”Looking ahead, we
don't know what to expect from
Ohio State [Pitt's next opponent],
since we have never swum
against them, but we will enter
the meet with a_posi_tive attitudef’
Pitt's domination of the meet’

- was also apparent in the diving

competition in which the Lady

' Panthers swept first through third

places on the one-and three-
.meter boards.

Junior Cathy McDonald won
the three—meter competition,
while freshman teammate Candy
Yackmack took a first place fin-
ish on the one-meter board.

”This was my best meet so far.
this year. I am finally comfortable
with all the dives on my list; that
made a big difference in the meet
against-WVU,” said Yackmack.
”At this point in the season, we
are allstarting to peak and we
will be diving a lot better.”

The Lady Panther divers had a
lot more to celebrate than just a
good meet. Junior Shelley Bows-
er, McDonald, sophomore Mar-
gie Paulick and Yackmack all
managed to qualify for the tough
NCAA pre-qualifying meet in
March.

The Lady Panthers are onthe ‘
road for their last twodual meets
of the season. Pitt doesn't know ’
quite what to expect from Ohio,
State this weekend, as they have '

not competed against them in

eight‘ years. The following,

‘weekend the Lady Panthers will. .
"round up their season with7 a

tough meet against Brown
University. ’ - i ‘
”lf we keep swimming the way
we have been, we should have
no problems,” said Belowich..
”Already Sue Hickman has quali-
fied for the NCAA championships
and Sandy Albright, Laure Walc-
zak, and both relay teams are .

very close to qualifying. We

should have good swims at the
Big East this year.”

Continued from page 11

F Charles [Smith] inside. They

(defenses) can collapse the mid-
dle, but that opens things up for
the guards.

”Tonight they were hitting their
shots, so we were free in the mid-
dle to do what we wanted.”

Many in “the vocal Boston
crowd were also highly im-
pressed with ”Rome”, some even
comparing him to the hated -
but respected —— Charles Barkley.

”The guy is a killah inside. He
grabs the offensive rebound and‘
— BOOM! — two points.”

”Lane’s gonna be a heckuva
pro. The Celtics could use him
right now.”

”I really don't like basketball.
But hockey is pretty interesting.”

Okay, so we'll disregard that
last opinion, but one thing is for

[Lane's] really in-
timidating.

— [im O'Brien
’j'''''''' 99
certain — Lane has firmly estab-
lished himself as_ a prime—timer

with the crowds of foreign. courts.
His reputation in Fitzgerald

« Field House was neatly deified

earlier this season after a power-
ful one-handed superdunk ‘over
6-8 Illinois All—American, Ken
Norman. That one left even
Sports lllustrated’s Curry Kirk-
patrick, who was covering the
game, gasping for adjectives.

Since last season, people have
been waiting for Lane to explode
onto the basketball scene. It's
now safe to say he has.

Said Lane, ”We've been work-
ing real hard in practice at work-
ing the ball into the posts,
especially for the end of games.

’ I know I've worked real hard at

it. You saw what happened in the
St. John's game.“

After the game, O'Brien was
blatant in his description of his
team's big men. ”We got out-
played, that’s about it. They were
able to control the boards. Down
low our game was pretty much
shut down.” I

Need some advice to give to
your players, Jim? How about
”When inside, do as the ‘Rome’
do.”
