ing with the Greek community.
“When you are in a situation
that is very stressful and you feel
like you’re not valued as an
employee, it feels like you have a

thousand tons just" weighing _
‘down on you,” Triggs said.

“My last day at Pitt was
tough, because I had no idea it

was going to end like this, but the

ute I_walked out the door, a
huge weight lifted off my shoul-

On March 3, Anita Triggs

for six months.

explained that Triggs resigned
for personal matters and the mat-
ter could not be discussed.
“[Harn'gan] said I left for
personal reasons,” Triggs said. “I
wo11ld’ve rather [she had] said I
left for professional reasons,

because it had nothing to do with
personal [reasons] — it made it

Triggs said that several fac-
tors contributed to her decision to
leave. She felt that there was not
appropriate stafﬁng to handle all
of the Greek prograrmning, and

that there were not suﬁicient V

resources to aid the Greek com-

“The compatibility between

Triggs turned in her resigna-

“In the letter, I said that I —

would be willing to stay on until
the end of the semester, but it was
the decision of the administration
to go ahead and have the rela-

She mentioned that only 5
percent or so of her decision to
leave was actually based on con-
flicts with the students.

‘This really had very, very’

little to do with them,” she said.

Women bowleidiiover by response from sororities

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

Not all casual bowlers ﬁnd a “mov-
ing experience” waiting for them in the
lanes.

But that’s exactly what more than
80 Pitt women, members of nine
Panhellenic Association sororities,
found at Arsenal Bowling Lanes last
week.

On March 21, the women gathered
in a Bowl-A-Thon to raise money for a
cause that had affected many of them in
a personal way.

When the women of Kappa Kappa
Gamma found out earlier this semester

thatfas traveling consultant they. knew
well j from their national organization
had been A diagnosed with "breast cancer,
they V decided they wanted to» raise
money for the American Cancer
Society. Even with relatively short
notice, nine“ of Pitt’s 11 sororitiesin the
Panhellenic’ Association were able to
participate in the event. _

Lindsey Anderson, the event chair
and philanthropy chair for Kappa
Kappa Gamma, said she was impressed
by their enthusiasm.

“[It was] more of a response, as far
as the part of the different houses, than
I thought we’d_ get,” Anderson said.

Wearing pink shirts that read,

“Because every woman is a sister in the
ﬁght against breast cancer,” and shoes
on loan from the bowling lane, the
women bowled toward their goal of
$5,000. Although Anderson said she
wasn’t sure if the sororities were able to
meet their goal, she said her own house
raised about $1,000, mostly from
women’s families and friends. Several
Oakland businesses also contributed
money to some of the houses, Anderson
said, including Primanti Bros., Qdoba,
Panera and Puccini’s Hair Salon.

“It was incredible to see,” Anderson
added.

Cat Frizell, a member of Theta Phi
Alpha, said she felt the sororities

responded well because the cause,
breast cancer, affects many women.

“It wasn’t really a social event,” ~

Frizell said, referring to the philan-
thropic events that bring fraternity and
sorority members together in a social

setting. “We didn’t necessarily mix with _

other sororities, but we were all there
supporting the cause.”

“I think every woman in our. house

knows someone or has a relative who
has been impacted by breast cancer,”
said Beverly Graham, the president of
Sigma Sigma Sigma. She added that
many women in Pitt’s Greek system
might have to deal with breast cancer in
the future. "

Blue and Gold Society
members paint the town
in City Council chamber

PATRICK YoEsT
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh City Council consistently puts on one
of the most colorful shows in town, but a few Pitt
students brought some color of their own to the
council chambers yesterday morning.

Councilman Jim Motznik declared yesterday to

‘be “Blue and Gold Society Day” in the City of

Pittsburgh, in honor of the student organization at
Pitt. The Blue and Gold Society was founded in 1991
to act as a liaison between Pitt undergraduates and
Pitt’s alumni community.

Blue and Gold Society President Peter Stopp,
Internal Vice President Jill Albrecht and President-
Elect Heather Harmon represented the organization,
which was recognized at the beginning of yester-
day’s weekly council meeting. Maryjean Lovett,
Blue and Gold Society’s‘ adviser; was also present.

“Far too often, we don’t hear the good things the
universities do in the City of Pittsburgh,” Motznik
said at the meeting. “We need to recognize what the
Blue and Gold Society does.”

Albrecht is an intern in the office of Councilman
Motznik. Motznik, upon learning, about what the
Blue and Gold Society does on campus, raised the
idea of acknowledging the group’s successes with
the ceremonial honor. A t '

“He is a big supporter of the University of
Pittsburgh,” Albrecht said of Motznik.

Albrecht said that the Blue and Gold Society par- ,

ticipates in a wide range of activities at Pitt, which
includes charity work, like the group’s holiday toy
drive, as well as more official duties, like represent-
ing students at University functions.

“We are present at all of the alumni events, and
we are present at on-campus events for the chancel-
lor,” she said.

Students are selected early every spring from ‘a
large applicant pool, to keep the Blue and Gold
Society at about 30 members. Qualities such as
scholastic achievement, community service and cam-

pus leadership are considered in the selection
process.

Triggs: Greek advising job takes willingness to
learn and “delve into student experience”

Triggs, page 1

With Triggs gone, Harrigan has
taken administrative responsibility for
the Greek community. Triggs admit-
ted that, earlier in her career, she
would have said that someone with-
out Greek experience could not be an

' effective Greek adviser.

She added that, during her
employment at Miami University,
located in Oxford, Ohio, a non—Greek
person took over the position as a
Greek adviser and was successful.

“I think it really depends on ﬂie
person, and how‘ much [the Greek
adviser is] willing to learn, and how
much they are willing to delve into
the student experience — and the
Greek experience, in particular,”
Triggs said. u

“I think [Hanigan] will do the
best that she can, and that’s about all I
can say on that one,” Triggs said,
responding to the question of whether
Hanigan would be a successful Greek
adviser. _

When Triggs came to Pitt, she
said, she was surprised by the lack of
self-govemance of the three Greek
governance groups, the Interfraternity
Council, Panhellenic Association and
National Pan-Hellenic Council. She
said she was also surprised that the
university did not recognize off-carn-
pus fraternity houses.

_ \ “The unfortrmate [thing] about
alloftlrisistlratltlrinkiflhadﬂie
opportunity to meet with more stu-
dents, like maybe during my inter-
view, or something of that nature, I
would have had a better grasp of what
was going on,” Triggs said. “And,
unforttmately, Dr. Hanigan didn’t
give me a signiﬁcant amount of infor-
mation about everything that was
going on, and I will honestly say that

is because she really didn’t know.”
After taking the job, Triggs han-
dled the attempt to enlarge mernber—
ship in NPHC — the historically
black fraternities and sororities.
Triggs, who is a Zeta Phi Beta
sister, said she believes that expand-
ing NPHC is “inevitable.”
‘ “I think that the numbers ﬂuctu-
ating as much as ﬂiey do with NPHC
has really been a problem,” Triggs

said. “It’s been really diﬂicult for
them to be involved in larger Greek -

community events, because of their
size.”

Triggs said the proposed mem-
bership requirement of 10 students for
each NPHC organization was “great.”

“But I think they should maybe
be given a chance to gradually getto
that point,” she explained.

Triggs also addressed three judi-
cial decisions concerning fraternities:
Tau Kappa Epsilon, Zeta. Beta Tau
and Delta Sigma Phi. _

“I have to be one of ﬂie hearing
ofﬁcers in all of the cases; however,
the way the judicial process. works at
Pitt is that, ultimately, Dr. Daniel has

the ﬁnal decision and can override the 1

outcome of hearing oﬂicers,” Triggs
explained .

In both the TKE and ZBT cases,
Triggs said Daniel did not accept the
complete recommendations she and

the judicial board had made. A hazing ‘

complaint against TKE was given to
Triggs by. Dawn Wﬂson, the mother
of a freshmanpledge. After the frater-
nity president admitted to Triggs to
some of the accusations in complaint,
their recognition from the University
was revoked for a year, and they were
put on an additional two—year proba-
tion. ,

“I do not feel that what happened
with 'I‘KE was what I would have

been for,” Triggs said.
Zeta Beta Tau, already on social

probation for a year, was given an »

additional semester of probation. for
sawing a hole in their custodial supply
closet

But Triggs said she felt the deci-
sion regarding Delta Sigma Phi was
appropriate. Delta Sigma Phi lost its
recognition from the University and
its charter from its national organiza-
tion because of a hazing allegation
and for violating social probation. .

“[Delta Sigma Phi] had been ‘p
headed down a pretty negative path

for quite some time, and, again, in
[this] particular instance, there were
so many things besides hazing, also,
that were problematic,” Triggs said.
Triggs did not think that giving

‘IFC complete judicial power over all \

Greek matters would work, either.
Currently, IFC’s _ judicial board is

responsible for handling only rush
violations. Incidents like hazing go ‘
, directly to the University’s judicial

board. A

“Hazing . is illegal in
Pennsylvania,” Triggs said, explain-
ing that actions breaking the law
require the University’s oversight.

She suggested that IFC and the
University improve communication
with each other, possibly doing some-
thing “as simple as giving [an] IFC
representative an opportunity to be a
part of the hearing process.”

Triggs emphasized /the irnpor—

tance of education when dealing with 1‘

hazing sanctions.

“When we are dealing with haz-
ing situations, part of the sanctioning
has to be educational, because nine
times out of 10, people that are doing
the hazing are not these ridiculous,‘

Trash, crime and landlords raise some
problems for South Oakland residents

South Oakland, page 1

enforcement for the entire Oakland area,
according to Hart

South Oakland is deﬁned as the area on
the opposite side — away from Pitt —— of the
Boulevard of the Allies, stretching ﬁ'orn the
Swinburne Bridge by Greenﬁeld over
toward the Oakland entrance to the parkway.

Many students seem to think that South
Oakland is dirty, unsafe and infested with
pests. While some students have good expe-
riences with their landlords, others don’t
even know the people to whom they pay
rent. ‘ '

Ellonda Green, a 20-year-old psycholo-
gy major, has lived on Joncaire Street since
last May. According to Green, she has never
met her landlord, nor has she signed a lease.

“I keep calling my. landlord,” Green

'1 says. “The city has come and complained

about the trash, and when I moved in, [the
landlord] promised the kitchen and bath-
room would be renovated.”

According to Green, the landlord does-
n’t shovel her sidewalks, either, leaving
sheets of ice ﬂrat Green and her fellow ten-
ants slide‘ down, onto the street Though she
said her landlord has mentioned possible
rent increases, Green said she refuses to pay
more.

‘In addition to the potentially growing
rent, Green said she must pay $45 a month
for.parking, as well as gas and electric bills.

In contrast, Leah Wenger, a 21-year-old
social work major, does not have a problem

' with an absentee landlord.

“I have an amazing _landlord who is
very attentive to any of our needs,” Wenger

. said. “My apartment is well-maintained, and

he provides an exterminator every few
monthstomakesurethattheapartment
stays clean and bug-free.”

D Wenger’s experience living in South
Oakland has been pleasant, but she does rec-
ognizethat-thereareproblemswiththearea.

“Ihe cleanliness in South Oakland is

I . notthe greatest,” she said

.“I was unfortunate enough to have a
huge trash bag on the roof outside my wir1-
dow for a few months, until I bravely
climbed out the window to knock the bag
oﬂilthinkthatthelitteringandtrashin
[South Oakland] is the worst problem here,
other than the run-down apartments and
houses.” , I

A A’ Many residents, ‘ including Wenger,
believe one problem arises ﬁom trash being
collected on Friday mornings, just after the
unoﬂicial beginning of the weekend.

“On Thursday nights, when people go

_ out, they often throw the trash around that is

on the street,” she said.

Like Nathan Hart, Wenger has had
experiences in South Oakland that led her to
become more ‘involved in improving the
community. She is a member of the Olf-
Campus Housing Committee, which aids
students in matters ‘concerning otf-campus

housing. .

The general dirtiness of South Oakland
is an issue for many of its inhabitants.
Problems wiﬂr the tenant’s property should
bedirectedtothelandlord,butifthereisan
absentee landlord, tenants can report prob-
lems to the Allegheny County Health

' Department

Guillermo Cole is the public informa-
tion ofﬁcer for the Allegheny" Country
Health Department. He takes complaints for
tenants, usually concerning Housing Code
violations, structural problems and other
substandard conditions. He has also had
cases where a neighbor or landlord ﬁles a
complaint against an individual, while usu-
ally involves housekeeping, trash control or
vermin. .

Overall, Cole says, South Oakland isn’t
a problem.

“There is not much variation in com-
plaints over recent years in South Oakland,”
he said “South Oakland is no worse than
other rental areas like Shadyside, Central
Oakland, Squirrel Hill or ﬂre South Side.”

“The reason there are problems in

South Oakland is because of the extremely
. high density of rentals,” he added ’

But rented properties do not take up the
majority of space in South Oakland.
According to Kelly Hoffman, community
organizer for the Oakland Planning and
Development Corporation, South Oakland
is composed of approximately 50 percent
rentals and 50 percent long-term residents.
Neighboring Central Oakland — often
loosely referred to by Pitt students as “South
Oakland,” Central Oakland runs from Fifth
Avenue to the Boulevard of the Allies —. is
90 percent rentals. and 10 percentlong-term
residents. -

. The OPDC’s Community Organizing
Program is just one of three programs
offered to residents, but for college students
in off-campus housing, it may be the most
important offered The corporation works
with students and long-term residents ‘to
keep the area clean and work against absen-
tee landlords. They offer educational infor-
mation 'on tenamts’ rights, and they also
sponsor various programs, such as Keep It
Clean Oakland and Adopt-a—block, to keep
the area clean. 

According to Hoﬂinan, the biggest part
of the problem with housing in South

Oakland is that tenants don’t report prob-’

lerns.

“Many students don’t know what is
legal and what’s not,” Hotfmmr said “They
don’t know what is and’ isn’t a code viola-
tion.” ’

Hoffman explained that the corporation
has seen incidents of severe over-occupancy,
safety threats like bedrooms without win-

dows, and a lack ofa ﬁre escape, as well as i

the normal complaints concerning cleanli-
ness.

crazy, insane individuals they are nor-
mal people like you and me,” Triggs said.

Triggs also mentioned that there is a
“huge communication issue” between ﬂre
Greek community and the University that
needs to be resolved. I

“I don’t think communication
[between the Greeks and the University] is
good at all [right now],” she said. “I don’t
think that the responsibility is solely on the
administration, either.” A’

In reference to hiring a new Greek
adviser, Triggs said that the administration
must be clear about the expectations of the
job and about the things needed in the
oﬂice, as far as resources and support go.
She also suggested that students be "sur-

veyedlto help the administration under-

stand what students want to get out of the
Greek community. _

Triggs plans to leave Pittsburgh today,
heading back to her hometown of
Cincinnati, Ohio, to take a -break from
working in higher education.

“I really don’t have any ill feelings
toward anybody in this situation,” Triggs
said.

“I just think I realized that this experi-
ence was not what I expected it to be, and
that I felt, if I had more information [about]
the climate of the University [and] the cli-
mate of the Greek community, I would
have done things diﬂerently.” ~

no better than other areas. The thing is, there
is a lack of reporting [of violations] in South
Oakland” 1 *

issue. A I '
“The problems many long—terrn resi-
dents have With the students is that they are
most interested in partying, and not con-
cerned with their neighbors,” Hoffman

. explained.

_ Along with the cleanliness issues, crime
has become a concern for South Oakland
residents. According to. the Pittsburgh
Bureau of Police Crime Analysis Unit, there
was a 26.3 percent increase in crime
between 2002 and 2003. The most notable
increases were in aggravated assaults, mur-
der and robbery. .

In 2003, robbery went up 300 percent,
with an increase from three to 12 incidents.
There were no murders in 2002, but two in
2003. Aggravated assault had perhaps ﬂie
most notable rise, increasing from seven
incidents in 2002 to 25 in 2003.

Officer Ashley Thompson, of the city
police, is the crime prevention oﬁicer for
South Oakland According to Thompson,
most of the increases are a result of isolated
incidents, rather than an overall decrease in
the safety of the area

‘There was a case with a couple of
knuckleheads beating up people and rob-
bing them,” Thompson said _

“We arrested them,” Thompson adding,
explaining that the incident accounted for a
large part of the increase in assaults.

.Despitethefactthattheseincreasesare
related to speciﬁc events, it may not keep
students from feeling less safe in South
Oakland Leah Wenger has never had an

. issue with crime, but she is still on guard.

“Simply because I have never experi-
enced any crime, I deﬁnitely don’t take it for
granted,” Wenger explained. “I am very
careful when and where I walk when alone.
I also frequent Safe Rider.” .

' Ellonda Green said she feels similarly.

“I think it’s relatively safe,” Green
replied, when asked about crime in South
Oakland. “I think there’s just a general safe-
ty issue.”

Green explained that, while she doesn’t
feel threatened, she, like Wenger, is careful.

As a result of these crime issues, vari-
ous organizations, including the Pittsburgh
Police Department and OPDC, , have
attempted to take action.

OPDC has many programs in place to
clean up Oakland, and also to educate ten-
ants as to what is legal and what is not legal
for landlords. It, along with the Oakland
Community Council, want to help improve
thestandards for living in South Oakland, as
well as decrease the number of absentee
landlords.

The city police department works with
both ' of these groups, along with the
Pittsburgh Business Improvement District,
to help decrease the crime levels in South
Oakland as well as other regions of
Oakland. They have set up different block

parties, ﬁngerprinting children and making _

prevention materials available to die resi-
dents. ‘

According to Thompson, there is a
twofold plan of action for South Oakland.
When necessary, hot spots will be identiﬁed

V where crime is occurring, prompting oili-

cers to patrol those regions more often, and

in plain clothes. The second is the imple-

mentation of preventative actions, such as
block watches; Thompson feels the block
watch would help oﬂicers locate olfenders
and be more aware of the crime going on in
the area. 3 -

Note to Howie Day: No still means no

Singer-songwriter Howie Day is
scheduled to play at Mr. Small’s
Funhouse tonight, despite being
charged for misdemeanor counts of

“criminal damage to property and dis-

orderly conduct for allegedly locking
one woman in a bathroom and break-
ing another’s cell phone, according to
a criminal complaint filed in
Wisconsin.

According to the same complaint,
the incident occurred after one of the
women refused his sexual advances,
causing him to lock her in the bath-
room on his tour bus and break anoth-

A er woman’s phone when she tried to

call the police. He was released on
$850 bail.

Despite his relatively low bail and
misdemeanor charges, these are seri-
ous accusations.

" Given the somewhat tolerant,
somewhat castigatory attitude toward
rock star behavior — see Michael
Jackson,
Michael —- it’s important to remem-
berthat celebrities, even B—list ones,

‘ are people too.
People with really big busses and_

a healthy sense of entitlement, that is.

Day all but admitted to breaking
the,woman’s cell phone.

“That was probably wrong of
me,” Day said. “But I felt violated,”
the Associated Press reported.

R. Kelly and George’

He felt violated?

If this had been anyone else, if the
bus had been a dark alley, and the
women tried to escape, his excuses
Wouldn’t have been given press space.
Instead, the only real recourse we
have is incredulity and possibly not
going to his concerts.

‘ ,But how much do we, as potential
concert attendees, take his personal
life into account when making 'the
decision whether or not to go to his
show. / ‘

No matter how many times some
artists are accused — or convicted —
people will continueto adore them,
buy their albums and go to their con-
certs. .

And really, bad behavior doesn’t
change the music artists’ products -

o R. Kelly’s religious-tastic “Heaven, I

Need a Hug” beinglthe exception.

- Moreover, all publicity is good
publicity, as the saying goes, and if
the media —— The Pitt News included
—— criticizes Day, at least they’re talk-
ing. . I
But perhaps Day’s recent actions
will act as a warning: that “no” means
“no” means “no” means “don’t smash
anyone’s phone, or lock anyone in a
bathroom,” and following strangers,
even famous strangers, into busses or
alleyways, isn’t necessarily a good
idea. ‘

True friends will tell you what to wear

It’s Saturday night, time to get ready to
tear up the town, and I stand in ﬁont of the
abyss that is my closet faced with that age-
old dilemma —— a closet full of clothes, and

C nothing to wear. None of my roommates

.’

.weekend plans for a few min-

are home to offer their services for the
“make Colleen cute” challenge so, without
thinking twice, I fall back on old faithful —
my best friend from home.

Because I’m hell-bent on taking AT &T
for every‘dime it’s worth during the free
night and weekend hours, I call her up and
explain my ordeal. VV1thout missing a beat,
she says, “Wear your black,
off-the-shoulder, three—quar-
ter—length-sleeved shirt, your
not-too-blue jeans, black
heels ... and wear that chok-
er thing — it’s cute.” I inter-
ject the - idea of sporting an
alternate shirt, but she cuts
me oﬁ, saying, “No, that one
doesn’t do you justice.”

We discuss our various

utes, and I hang up. As I
reach into my closet to
retrieve the instructed items, I’m hit with an

_ eerie feeling. That girl knows me way too

damn well. Even while we’re living in sep-
arate zip codes, my best friend still has an
exact mental image of me —— and of all of
my clothes — and knows exactly the items
I will and will not wear.

Our friendship is based on the fact that

with an unhealthy infatuation with all

balance out our many diﬁerences, and to‘

like a chicken with its head out olf. I’m out
here doing my own thing — school, work,
living a life doomed to eternal single—dom
and slowly trying to rock the world one col-
umn at a time. '

In spite of our separate lives, we both
know that if either one of us were to wind
up naked in the street at 4 am. — that the
other would drop everything to go help out
without so much as blinking.

The hectic nature of our schedules

i Aunt Jemima. '

On my way to class last week, I passed an older
couple out for a morning stroll. They laughed, arm-in-
arm, their thick glasses shining in the
sun. The man’s cane moved with a sur-
prising vigor and determination, and my
ﬁrst thought was: Viagra commercial.
Then I cringed.

Believe it or not, I don’t want to be
thinking about Viagra — or Levitra, or
Cialis. Really, I would rather remain
ignorant about the state of elderly loins
and Mike Ditka’s bedroom game plan.
Erectile dysfunction is a dirty hobo living
at the end of a mental dark alley I’d pre-
fer not to visit. I

I have to admit I love any solution
that comes in pill form; pharmaceuticals
always shortcut past more difficult solu-
tions like, “Hey, try some tantric sex,” or “Hey, try
actually talking toyour partner.” But complaining
about America’s love affair with quick-ﬁx potions is
like shooting doped—to-the-gills fish i-n a barrel of_,

" The bigger problem —- for me, anyway — is why
can’t I get the Viagra brand out of my head? Why
can’t_I see a couple enjoying a walk in the sun with-
out seeing a\ logo plastered over them?

The short answer is: advertising. In 1997, the
Federal Drug Administration relaxed regulations on
drug advertisements, allowing companies to market
prescription drugs directly to consumers. Viagra
debuted in 1998; thanks in part to heavy advertising,
it did more than a billion dollars in sales the first year.
Fast-forward six years and you have Mike Ditka ques-

tioning the manhood of any guy who won’t admit to ~

suffering from an occasionally limp member. (Wait;
I’m not a man if my penis gets hard when I
i want it to?)

Yes, it might still be a little gross to
hear a commercial warn you about the
side-effect of a dangerous, unstoppable
erection, but Viagra is just a new and icky
case of a larger problem: the way brand
names and corporate logos seep into our
minds and color our perceptions. The pur-
pose of advertising is to colonize the space
between your ears and ﬁll it with slogans
and catchphrases —— and ﬁnally, to sell you
something. How many people actually
said, “Wasssssssup?” before those
Budweiser commercials appeared? And
how many cases of Bud sold because we

all started using that stupid greeting?
There’s a reason the Advertising Age uses terms

like “mindshare.’? Marketing is about moving,rnin,ds-

toward the.“buy”" response, bywhatever means avail-

able, and as the ﬂash, glamour, and irrationality of ads '

seeps”-into everything, it becomes harder to imagine a

different goal. We are always buying or selling-

Advertising has become our public language, no mat-
ter what the subject. :

Politicians are sold as Pepsi vs. Coke, image—spun
and airbrushed into pleasing shapes’ for public con-
sumption. Museums are designed as shopping malls
and sponsored by corporations; education becomes
‘~‘edutainment” aimed not at teaching, but selling -the
idea of learning. Perhaps most depressingly, Fast
Company encourages us all to “be your own brand,”

Viagra and other ads colonized that space between my ears

the “CEO of Me Inc.” Think of yourself as a walking,

talking, advertisement for You —— Paris Hilton is your .

model.

There’s something really creepy about a society of
people who can only relate to one another as products
to be consumed. The only emotion advertising pro-
vokes is insecurity — we can never have enough, or
we have too much, or somehow thisis not the best of
all possible worlds unless you have this product.
That’s a pretty shallow and unsatisfying way to -inter-
act with other people; no wonder we’re so unhappy.
Rather than in real emotional ties, our happiness lies
in ﬁnding the perfect piece of merchandise.

Asiadvertising slinks its way into every facet of ‘

our lives —-— bathrooms, classrooms, doctor’s ofﬁces,
foreheads —— it grows harder and harder to imagine an
escape, a place untouched by overwhelming com-
merce. The mountain view is brought to you by
Kodak; the connection to your friends sponsored by
Sprint. '

If you care about this stuff — andll don’t know if A i

you do — you have to admit that in some sense, we’ve

‘already lost. Bring on the neural marketing; beamads;  V -
directly into our dreams; Carve a Coca-Cola logo ‘on’

the moon — it’s all just details if you own the mind.
We already see _the world through branded glasses.
We’ve learned to be insecure and constantly selling.

,We may be doomed, Ganesha help us, to always ~

speculating about the chemically enhanced boner in
Grandpa’s pants.

Jesse Hicks is available for children ’s parties and bar
mitzvahs. E-mail him at jhi_cks@pittnews.c0m for a
price estimate.

Bring backthe simplicity of “Do you like me?Check yes orno.”

For a country that seems to pride
itself on an abundance of in—your-
face sex, violence and exploding
things, why do we seem to have such
a problem with interpersonal com-
munication?

Making out with a total stranger
at a party seems to be a time—hon-
ored tradition, but when it comes to
matters of meaningful social inter-
action — especially with the oppo-
site sex —- people are afraid to speak
their minds and ask frank questions
of others. These trends in social
awkwardness trace their roots, back
to our earliest days of peer interac-
tion. ‘ i ' - ‘ ‘

Example: Jimmy and Ashley are
first—graders. Jimmy has a crush on
Ashley. The normal behavior for this
situation entails Jimmy, kicking
Ashley in theshins and rubbing mud
in her hair. This will cause Ashley to
cry, whichgwill, in turn, force'Jimmy
to ﬂee, fearing prosecution as an
adult if he lives in a Southern state.

This is the template foriihow peo-
ple act toward the opposite sex, even
15 years removed from their play-
ground days. Though the mud and
crying have been replaced by body
language and dating protocol, the

Side projects, hiatus allowed Death Cab

Cutie, page 7

“When we were making
Transatlanticism, we just said, whatever
the songs need, we’re going to do, and
we’re not going to force anything on a
particular song if it doesn’t call for it.”
The resulting album is Death Cab at its
bittersweet-melancholy best.

VV1th an arsenal of such music, it
might be hard to believe that a band like
Death Cab could get more worn out on
the road than most bands —— it was a pri-
mary reason for their hiatus, after all. But
their sound doesn’t betray their stage
presence.

“We like to bring a lot of energy to
the music, which probably surprises most
people when they see us live, given the
sort of melancholy quality of our records
over the years,” Harmer said. “They
expect our live shows to be us sort of
standing in the shadows, looking at our
feet, kind—of mopey. And that’s not the
case at all. I’ve never seen a crowd pogo,
and there’s no stage diving at our shows,
but we do have a good time.”

As Death Cab tours and records

more, band members ﬁnd their crowds
growing larger and larger. “I’m always
really excited about anybody that comes
to the shows or anyone who buys a
record,” Harmer said. “And we’re always
convinced that when we play a show or
make a record that that’s the last one —
it’s going to be over the next day, and no
one’s going to like us anymore.”

This idea of everything ending for
the band tomorrow has created, within
Death Cab, a sense ‘that they aren’t enti-
tled to any amount of success, huge
record sales or a gargantuan fan base.
And they don’t have any expectation of it,
either.

“If you would have asked me seven
years ago where I saw this band, I don’t
think I could have said here,” Harmer
said. “It’s a super surprise. It’s great.”

Death Cab for Cutie plays Club Laga’s
penultimate show on Thursday, along
with Ben Kwellerand Aveo. Doors open
at 6 p.m., and the show starts’ at 7 p.m.
Tickets are $15 in advance and $17 the
day of the show. For more infomiation,

Carina Round breaks out of the U.K. and onto the U.S. scene

The Disconnection
Carina Round
Interscope Records
7i‘rﬂr‘7i‘x'

Recommended if you like: PJ
Harvey, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs

Carina Round has been hiding
out in the United Kingdom for way
too long. She has a lot of talent
locked up in her for her being so
young. Hailing from
Wolverhampton, England, she
released her first album, The First
Blood Mystery, in 2001 at the age of
22. She has toured with the likes of
David Gray, Coldplay and Ryan
Adams.

Her second release, The
Disconnection, has slow, melodic
tunes with a touch of raw and edgy
fury right in the places it’s needed.
A little more complex than her
rawer first album, she sings with the
delicate fury of PJ Harvey and Patti
Smith. ‘

The Disconnection fits right in
at a time when the Yeah Yeah Yeahs
are beginning to take over airwaves.
She has a lot of the same aspects as
the YYY’s Karen 0 has. Round’s
looks and voice have strikingly sim-
ilar qualities to those of Karen 0,
although Round’s vocals can run a
lot smoother and more melodically.

She doesn’t rock out as hard at
times, and has more of a pop sound

to differentiate the two.

Her first single, “In My Blood,”

has a touch of what Karen 0 gives
to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The soft,

steady rhythm of the guitars keeps
this track moving along with a sim-
plistic smoothness.

Another standout song, “Paris,”
is a love song to the spectacular
Paris and all other things beautiful

CONTACTMUSIC.COM

in the world. It’s
acoustic pop song that’s soothing to
the ears.

Her songwriting and the way
she presents it havebluesy charac-
teristics. For example, in “Motel

74,” she skillfully uses her voice to
convey the emotion of the words,
“I could open my hands and let the
rain come down/But you’re just
too close to dream I have/I’m
scared and I don’t know why/I
couldn’t watch you go/I can’t
watch you go/You know it sounds
strange and untrue/But I miss
you.”

She has a great, unique sound
thatileads one to wonder how we
overlooked it. S-he combines an
array of beats and rhythms to cre-
ate her own sound. The only fault
the album has is it can run together
at certain points. Adding more
heavy songs onto this album to mix
it up a little bitwould benefit it a
lot. The album can drag on with its
slow beats sometimes, making the
songs seem longer then they actu-
ally are. ’

Carina Round strives to dodge
the pop-culture fad of selling her-
self. She wants to just sell the emo-
tions-and quality of her music. If
only that sold record, she would
have sold a million records by now.

Jim’s Big Ego

Boston-based band Jim’s Big
Ego has been compared to such acts
as They Might Be Giants. It has also
been recommended in the December
2003 issue of Entertainment Weekly
as “wise-acre rock a la Weezer.” It’s
no surprise, considering some of
their songs contain lyrics very sim-
ilar to the fun, uninhibited style of
both Giants and Weezer. For exam-
ple, a track called “Party on the
Everglades” from their newest
album, They're Everywhere,
released in November of 2003, con-
tains nonsense like “She’s got the
bejeezuz/bleeding from her
arms/she’s autostigmatismatic/she
sets off car alarms.” Lyrics like
these contribute to what Ego calls
its very “unpop” sound — intelli-
gent pop songs that alternate
between unabashedly hilarious and
unpretentiously moving.

Jim’s Big Ego is a trio led by
singer/songwriter and guitarist Jim
Infantino, and rounded out by clas-

is everywhere!

sically trained bassist Je_sse Fleck

and drummer Dan Cantor. Since the
band’s formation, the three have
released four full—length albums,
including They’re Everywhere, a
collection of 12 songs ranging from
the melancholy yet cheery “Mix

Tape” to the humorous “Math Prof

Rock Star.” '

' Because of their appeal, ‘they
have shared the stage with such
bands as Cake and Moxy Fruvous
and The Push Stars, and musicians
like Ani DiFranco and Jill Sobule.
Fans of bands like They Might Be

Giants, Weezer, The Presidents of
the United States of America and

Phish ‘might want to give this
unusual‘ group a try.

Jim’s Big Ego performs at Club

Cafe on the South Side Thursday.

Vietnam Film Festival kicks off at Carnegie Mellon

Looking for something more
than practical jokes to enliven your
April Fool’s Day? Thursday, April 1
kicks off Carnegie Mellon
University’s ‘Tour of Duty,” a four-
day film festival featuring block-
busters and documentaries about the
Vietnam War. _

“Tour of Duty” has a spectacular
lineup, including the works of
Stanley Kubrick, Oliver Stone and
Francis Ford Coppola. Thursday
evening closes with Kubrick’s “Full
Metal Jacket,” which explores the
brutalities of basic training before
diving into the horrors of actual com-
bat.

Friday’s highlight is “Platoon” —
Stone’s Academy Award—winning
ﬁlm in which danger and hostility can
come from one’s own side. Told
through the eyes of a new recruit,
“Platoon” traces the bonds and con-
ﬂicts of a single American unit.

The third day wakes up to “Good

Morning, Vietnam” — an injection of
humor via Robin Williams in the
midst of an otherwise somber subject.

The box office hit “We Were
Soldiers” and Coppola’s
“Apocalypse Now” will be screened
later on Saturday.

Sunday features primarily docu-
mentaries. The last of the lineup,
“The Fog of War,” remembers crucial
moments of Vietnam through the
words of former U.S. Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara. Director
Errol Morris’ ﬁlm picked up the 2003
Academy Award for Best
Documentary.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

Rain sends
softball
home early

JIMMY JOHNSON
STAFF WRI'I'ER

Rain, rain, go away. Come again
 next week.

That’s what one Pitt softball play-
er sang as she walked away from the
waterlogged softball diamond -— also
known as Trees Field — with the rain
still falling at a steady pace.

“But what are you going to do
about the weather?” head coach
Michelle Phalen asked, shrugging her
shoulders and looking out into the
downpour she was avoiding by stand-
ing in the dugout.

Pitt (13-17) was scheduled to
play a doubleheader in its home-
opener Tuesday against Youngstown
State, but only got to play an inning
and a half.

The Panthers retired the Penguins
in the top of the first, keeping the
game scoreless. 

In the bottom of the second,
senior catcher Heather Andrews stood
at the plate with sophomore second
baseman Francesca DiMaria on sec-
ond and freshman shortstop Sheena
Hellon onthird.

After fouling off several pitches,
Andrews was walked to load the
bases.

But before sophomore third base-
man Jen O’Donnell could take a
swing, the umpires called a rain
delay, and fifteen minutes later, they
cancelled both games.

“It was disappointing,” Phalen
said about ending the game with the
bases loaded. “I felt like we were
going to play really well today. We
were prepared, and the rain just did
not cooperate.”

Phalen explained how both
coaches made the decision to not play

, because it was too risky for their

players to play on Trees Field in its
muddy condition.

“Someone was going to get hurt if
we played any longer,” Phalen said.

The Panthers now look forward to
an exciting week of games.

They play a double-header
against Robert Morris on Thursday

Pipeline from New York to Pittsburgh continues

Pittsburgh Port Authority might
have to create a new bus line —'— one
that will go non-stop from Oakland to
New York City. The Pitt coaching
staﬁ? is raiding New York again. On
the side of the bus, much like the
buses have now, should be writing
that reads, “Black Magic,” and.
“Taftzilla” —— along with the.obliga’-
tory bumper sticker that reads, “I love
N.Y.”

It’s the bumper sticker that all Pitt fans should own,
because if it wasn’t for the neighbor to the northeast, Pitt’s
basketball team might be on the same boat as its football
team. S

year. I know that is tough to hear after losing in the Sweet

16 for the third straight year, but the recruits coming in can .
make the ditference. From the sounds of it, Jarrrie.Dixon’s
, recruiting class should be amazing. " I A

I’m talking Sweet 16—caliber.

Andbythat,Imeanateamthatcanactuallywininthe 1

Sweet 16. .

Dixon’s rumored recruiting class has the potential to
be one of the best in the nation, which is crucial because
guards Jaron Brown and Julius Page will be departing.
Both were a critical part of Pitt’s defense during recent
success, and their defense is what will be missed the most.
However, their offense of late — or shall I say, lack of
offense — will not.

 

Panther fans should hold more excitement for next»

And that’s where the new
recruits step in.
At Page’s old position, we

point guard from the Bronx who aver-
aged 19.2 points per game in his
junior year. He will step in and have a
legitimate chance at beating out
A guards Yuri Demetris and Antonio
Graves for the starting shooting guard
. position,» based on the play we saw
from both players this year. If both Graves and Demetris
can’t ﬁnd their shot by the start of next season, they should
be on the look out, because New York is stepping‘ in. I

And Ramon stepping in couldbe the answer to Pitt’s
Sweet 16 dilemma. "He has made the difference in touma—
ments thus far in his young career. But don’t take that from
me. Take that from what Paul Brown, the director of the
New York Gauchos, said in a  Tribune-Review
article back in October. * if ‘i ‘

“This is all you really need to know: When [Ramon]
wasn’t with us for a couple of tournaments, we lost.” A

Ramon led the Gauchos, one of the nation’s most
prestigious Amateur Athletic Union programs, to two
national AAU titles, and one year helped them ﬁnish as the
national runner-up.

Add his talent and skill to that of Carl Krauser, and we
might see two “X’s” being signaled on the court after
every basket next year.

In Brown’s spot, we might ﬁnd yet another New

might see Ronald Ramon, a- 6—foot ‘

Yorker. John DeGroat, a junior college transfer from
Northeastern Junior College in Colorado, is a native of
Monticello, N.Y., and will compete for the three-guard
position. The 6-foot-6-inch guardis considered a three-
point threat, something Pitt has lacked as of late —-— unless
you count Mark McCarroll when he’s standing alone on
the outside of the arc';‘ .

DeGroat hit six of seven from beyond the arc in his
ﬁnal game at Northeastern. He ﬁnished the season shoot-

1 ing 44.4 percent from three-point land, which is better than

the current season total of Connecticut’s Ben Gordon —
43.7 percent And‘ we all saw what a three-point shooter
like Gordon can do for a team.

DeGroat also averaged 11.7 points and 6.9 rebounds
per game. ‘

Another guard coming next year is Keith Benjamin
from Mt Vernon, N.Y. He will be competing for playing
time with the rest of the guards, and could be a crucial part
of Pitt’s bench.

All year, Pitt’s bench has been great in the frontcourt
position, but the backcourt lacked depth And now, with
the three additional guards, Pitt can have more faith in its
backcourt positions. ‘

The only question that remains now is, when will this

bus line from New York to Oakland stop rtmning?

Let’s just hope it doesn’t

COURTESY or EQUESTRI

Team member Kira Mamula proudly displays her blue ribbon won in last weekend’s
regional competition. Mamula is one of four Pitt riders with a chance at nationals.

While competing at the regional
show in Canonsburg, Pa., Pitt’s
equestrian team had a successful out-
ing, winning reserve highpoint team
(second place) in a field that included
more than a dozen total schools.

In order to be eligible for region-
al competition, riders had to first
accumulate a set number of points in
their particular events. While point
requirements varied for each class,
points earned by individuals were the

-same for all events.

First-place finishes were worth
seven points. Second place earned a
rider five points, and four points were
awarded for third—place finishes.

Another aspect of "regional com-
petition that added difficulty was the
tests given to the riders. Judges gave
riders more difficult tasks to com-

plete, such as riding a majority of the ‘

class without stirrups.

Pitt’s- equestrian team qualified
four riders in their division and also
qualified for the Cachion Cup, which
is a class for the top six open riders
for the year. While competing for the
Cachion Cup, riders must jump a
course at the most difficult height

judges then combine the two scores,
and the rider with the highest com-
bined point total wins.

Pitt’s Emma Taylor brought home
second place in this year’s Cachion
Cup.

Jocelyn Kozick competed in two
events and earned second place in
novice fences and fourth place in
intermediate ﬂat.

In the novice ﬂat class, Kira
Mamula brought home the blue rib-
bon; one of four first place ﬁnishes by
Pitt. .

Melania McSweeney finished
first in both the alumni fences and
alumni ﬂat classes.

And grabbing the fourth Pitt blue
ribbon was Sidney Rozek, who
earned first place in advanced walk,

7 trot, and canter.

The last competition before
nationals are the zones, which will be
held at Nemacolin Woodlands on the
weekend of April 10. Pitt will be
sending McSweeney, Kozick, Rozek
and Mamula.

“All four of them have a great
chance to reach nationals,” Taylor
said.

Two magazine cover jinxes and
many unanswered questions

MAR ENNS

   

In-case you were wondering. . .

°Think the Sports lllustrated cover jinx
doesn’t exist? Think again.

Earlier this year, the Philadelphia‘

Eagles were featured on the cover after
defeating the Green ' Bay Packers in the
National Football Conference’s semiﬁnals.
The following week, the Eagles lost to the
Carolina Panthers. .

The same thing then ' happened to
Carolina. The Panthers were on ﬂie cover
following their big win, and promptly lost
the Super Bowl the following week.

It’s carried over to college basketball as

’ well. Less than a day after that week’s issue

of SI had been "released, Alabama-
Birmingham — which was on the cover
with Alabama —— dropped its Sweet .16
game against Kansas. - '
The Crimson Tide fared only slightly

better, making it to the“Elite Eight before’

losing to Connecticut.

°The jinx hasn’t been limited to just Sports

, Illustrated.
Its college equivalent, Sports  p

on Campus, has also given some bad luck to
those-who have graced its cover.

Last semester, undefeated Oklahoma
was featured on ﬂie term’s ﬁnal issue. The
Sooners then lost their "next two games. A

few issues before that, the ESPN GameDay .

crew was on the cover, _ and was in a minor
car accident a couple of weeks later. .

It has carried on to this semester as
well.

Josh Childress, Stanford’s top player, I

‘was featured on the cover with former
[UCLA coach John lWooden. Stanford,
which lost only one game all season, lost its

second—round game to Alabama that week-
end.

Last week’s issue featured Pitt’s very
own Panther holding a sign, which read
“San Antonio or bust” You don’t need me
to tell you that neither the Panther, nor Pitt’s
basketball team, will be headed to Texas this
year.

°With that in mind, would it be possible for

either publication to put Duke on the cover .

this week? Please?

°While they’re at it, how about putting the

Yankees on the cover, too. Every single.
week. i

°There was a proposal made to the NFL this
past week to expand the number of playoff

. teams from 12 to 14, meaning thatseven

teams from each conference would be in the
postseason. '

But why just add two teams? VV1th that
format, the No. 1 seed in each conference
would be the only team with a bye,- giving
those teams an unfair advantage. .,

So why not add two teams to each con-
ference and give no one a bye?

°Instant replay. is sticking around for the
next ﬁve seasons in the NFL, ‘and it comes
with a special offer. ’ ’ . _
If a coach uses his two challenges an
gets both right, the team gets a third chal-
lenge. However, only once’ last season did a
team use two challenges successfully, so
what are ﬂle chances of that third one ever
being used?

°Did the Yankees really lose that badly to"

Tampa Bay in Japan, or did ﬂie score get
messed up_ when being translated?

°Why does Major League Baseball think
it’s a good idea to have two teams start the
season a week early? And why in Japan?

°Why am I asking so many questions?

Jae Mamhileria is the sports editor of .The
Pitt News, and he really doesn’t have a clue.
