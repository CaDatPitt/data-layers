State Guidelines  

Labeled Unlikely"

‘ BY SUSAN MANNELLA

‘A recommendation from the
State Appropriations Committee
suggesting guidelines for st_ate-re-
lated university tuition increases,
requested by the University Stu-
dent Board, is unlikely, according
to three Allegheny County Com-
mittee members. .

.The request, made in a May 13
letter from the University Student
Board, was sent to all members of
the -State?‘ Senate and House
Appropriations Committees.

The letter asked the Committees
“to publicly deﬁne their views on
higher education, and take a policy
stand on tuition for state-related
universitites. ”

State Senator Thomas M. Nolan
said the Appropriations,Committee
has never made this type of
recommendation because its func-
tion is to allocate funds to the
schools that, in turn, must
determine if a tuition increase is
needed.

~ Nolan said he feels “a reason-
able amount for a tuition increase
should not exceed $50.”

“It would be difﬁcult for the

Appropriations Committee to make
a recommendation of this type,”
said Se

4 ‘Mis-located’ funds

BY MATTHEW" KENNEDY

Student Activities funds a-
mounting to $156,000 reported as
“mislocated,” have been ac-
counted for by the Student Affairs
Office, and the possibility of
windfalls for/Student Government
has vanished.

The amount was an accounting
“phantom” arising from a mis-
interpretation of the accounts
falling under the control of . the
Student Affairs Office, according to
Director_ of Student Activities
Daniel Meloro, who was appointed
by Vice-Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Moye to investigate
the matter.‘ -

“We went over and talked to the
auditors, and as for the $156,000
windfall, ther€;‘f§.,»_, just is no such
animal,” Melofo said.

“Someone in the University
ofﬁce didn’t understand the way
our office works, for instancethat
there are three separate student
governments with three separate
student activities fees.”

‘The $156,000 was “found” in
agency accounts within the Univer-
sity accounting mechanism sup-
posedly under the control of the
Student Affairs Office. '

“The probable at one time had
as many as 30 names. It dwindled
to 13 or ‘so, and the study
committee did an intensive review
of those. The ultimate list of six
was proposed to the Chancellor and 1
Stark, ’ ’ Montgomery said.

The deciding qualiﬁcations re-
ﬂected a unique consideration of
the
desire to incorporate academic
medicine into community affairs.

“Medical schools all around the
country are changing, not just
Pitt’s,” Werner said. “We are
faced with a new set of tasks to
relate in some way to the
community.”

Werner emphasized that Pitt’s
programs for regional coordination
of education and services in
Western Pennsylvania must not
continue at the expense of the
traditional educational aspects of
medicine.

“We cannot cut off our nose to
spite our face,” Werner said. “We
must retain our academic stan-
dards. There is a network
relationship in which we contribute

, to education within the periphery of

the community.” A

Z IStark noted that Werner is ‘
largely responsible for the initia-
tion of the regional programs,
specifically the Medical School’s
Primary Care Program.

“One of the most important,
things we must provide,” Werner
said, “is to. assure (medical)
students of opportunities outside
the Health Center. We must make
sure they broaden their exposures,
and, one way to do this is through
the programs.”

account for all student activities
monies.

The accounting system within
the University works by a progres-
sive transfer of cash ﬁgures from a
general “wash”- account holding
all » free cash, to the Student
Activities account, to various
agency accounts from which
student groups draw their funds.

According to Meloro, the trou-
bles arose when no distinction was
made between Student Activities
agency accounts and other agency
accounts within the University that
do not operate under the same
auditing procedure. .

“For instance, ” Meloro said,
“that $156,000 ﬁgure included
accounts for computer research and
the School of General Studies
which aren’t under our control.”

Chief University Auditor Rodger
C. Greene said the University is
waiting for the Student Activities
Office to analyze theaccounts that
total to $156,000 to determine
‘where the money belongs.

“Thay (Student 'Affairs)
looked at a recap of the level ones
(monthly budget reports) for all
the figures we have, broken down
month by month,” Greene said.

. “We're waiting for them to
analyze the accounts and differ-

renceate as t0 what accounts are ._

theirs or not,“ Greene added.

The American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) is
the favorite choice as a bargaining
group if and when a University-
wide vote on faculty unionization
occurs, according to a survey taken
by three members of the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs (GSPIA).

The survey, which sampled the
opinions of 99‘ tenure stream
faculty members, show the AAUP
is almost twice as popular as the
Pitt Professional Uniow (PPU) ‘and
three times as popular as the
Pennsylvania State Educational
Association (PSEA) as a choice to
represent Pitt faculty.

Twenty-two per cent of_ the
faculty responding voted for the
AAUP, 13% voted for the PPU and
8% voted for the PSEA. Forty-one
per cent said -they preferred no
bargaining representative, and
16% of the faculty were uncertain _
of their choice for representation.

The survey was conducted by
Associate Professor Michael Gold,
Associate Professor William Mat-
lack and doctoral student David
Phillips of GSPIA during the fall
terms of 1973 and 1974 in order to
forecast the result of facultyvoting
concerning unionization.

More than 200 faculty members
were questioned by mail.
Approximately 40% of the ques-
tionnaires were returned with
usable data. No follow-up was
made for those who did not
respond.

Student Government President
Larry Platt told the Trustees the.
designation is needed because of
an agreement worked out between
Student Government and the Pitt
News. “The charter is needed
because of our new funding
policy,” Platt said:

Under the new funding policy,

has determined a current surplus in
student accounts of some $56,000,
according to Meloro. —
This new sum is a real ﬁgure
resulting from the practice of
ﬁguring in a “-buffer” of several
thousand dollars to avoid deﬁcit
expenditures by theAllocations
Committee. ’ ' v
I “We projectted a surplus of
$36,000,” ‘Meloro said,
currently it looks like $56,000. It-’s
because enrollment was _,greater‘~
that expected, so revenues were
larger, and more groups spent less
than they were allocated for.”. '

“For instance, if the chess‘ club
was allocated money to by six chess
boards, and a new president didn’t
follow through, the surplus would
show up on our books.” '

Meloro commented the problems
over the $156,000-were beneﬁcal to
his ofﬁce and the - University
because they pointed out hurdles in
Pitt’s accounting system, which’
was just recently instituted.

‘‘If that computer system" worked
like it was promised to work, there
would be no problems,” Meloro
said, “but there are a lot of bugs
that need to be worked out before it
runs right.” i

As a result of the Trustees’
designation,,: the Pitt News is the
official student newspaper, able to
draw funds from ,Pitt’s student
governments unless it violates its
by-laws, ﬁscal guidelines or state-
ment of purpose.

Board Chairman William Rhea
questioned the feasibility of mak-
ing the Pitt News a ﬁnancially
independent newspaper. “Have
you considered the possibility of
operating the paper without re-
liance on the University?” he
asked.

Pitt News .Editor Matthew
Kennedy responded, “To ask the
paper to incorporate overnight is a
poor move. The staff is not ready
for it yet. That’s why we want a
gradual development over a three-
year period.” c ,

The Trustees also approved a

proposal authorizing Pitt to_ award
associate degrees at the Bradford
and Titusville campuses.
- In a memorandum to the Board,
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar said,
“The establishment of selected
programs leading to the associate
degree, we believe, would increase
markedly the ﬁnancial viability of
our campuses at Bradford and
Titusville, as well as our ability to
serve regional needs.” «

Posvar ‘went on to say a limited
number of associate degrees would
serve the community‘ college
function. ,

The Trustees passed a resolution
thanking the state for showing its
conﬁdence in Pitt by selecting the
University to establish an Ethnic’
Heritage Studies Program. They
passed another thanking 15 Japan-
ese corporations for their contribu-
tion of $1 million to further Pitt’s
Asian Studies Program.

Ford Prepares

‘Strong Campaign

BY HOWARD BENEDICT
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON AP--President
Ford told Republican senators
Wednesday he will run a vigorous
campaign for the presidency. next
year and carry .a -strong and
constructive program to the people.

Senator Hugh Scott, R-.Pa., told
newsmen of the‘ President’s inten-
tion and predicted Ford wouldwin‘
elction for a four-year term.‘ He
also said he does not expect Ford to
have "any substantive  challenge
within the Republican party and
“with a few exceptions, the present
Democratic candidates are a
parade of pygmies.”

Scott, and nine other GOP
senators,-who are up for re-election
in 1976 met with Ford at the White

House on Wednesday to discuss.

election prospects for next year.
He said the President hasn’t
decided when to officially kick off a
campaign but that Ford had asked
Scott and Rep. John Rhodes,
R-Ariz.,.House minority leader, to
be ‘on-~--the planning committee
which will make that decision.
A Scott said that . during the
meeting Wednesday Ford made it

clear to the senators he “intends to_

be a vigorous candidate following
the convention and that he will
carry a very strong and construc-
tiveprogram to the people.”

Scott said the President received
assurances of support from the
senators.. ’ 6 ‘

“It is my personal opinion,” he
said,v“that he will not have any
substantive challenge for the
nomination.’ ’

Questioned about a "potential
challenge from former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan, who has been
gaining conservative support, Scott
replied, “In my own mind, I am
reasonably certain Ford will have
the delegates he needs.”

Representatives of the Peace
Corps and VISTA will discuss with
interested seniors the possibility of
Peace Corps or VISTA service
following graduation.

The representatives will be on '

the ground floor, CL, next
Wednesday from 10 am to 4_pm.

Named to

increases at the state colleges. I
don’t think a ‘$50 increase is
enough,” Senator Eugene F.
Scanlon said.’

He said 90% of the increased
costs of educating students at tl_1_of"‘\,. r
colleges have been absorbed b'y7fPie ’ '
legislature and only 10% by the
students in the past several years.

“If the state/colleges’ tuition is
increased byiaround $200, we may
be able to keep tuition down at Pitt,
Penn State and Temple,” Scanlon
said.

An attempt also will be made to
secure separate allocations for the
dental clinics at the three schools,
which noyv come out of the general
allocation for the universitites,
according to Nolan.

He also said Shapp plans to ask
the three universities if funds left
to the schools under trustee
accounts and wills have been used
in meeting rising operating ex_-7“

penses. . — A  ‘V ___";_r:'
“I don’t agree with that. When_ ' 

you get into this problem, you very
well may be talking about taking
monies that were meant for a
different purpose,” Nolan said.-
.“Often when a person leaves
money to a school, it is intended for
speciﬁc programs.”

Scanlon said he’ is very much
concerned over.the -rising cost of
higher education in Pennsylvania ,
and plans to introduce legislation _
imposing a graduated tuition scale
for state students. ' -

“The bill would require ever
student entering a Pennsylvania
school to ﬁle a ﬁnancial statement.
Tuition would be determined on the
basis of that,” Scanlon said. _

“I_think if a person can afford ﬁg‘: ‘j 
pay full cost of education, he
should have to pay it. On the other
hand, if the student cannot afford
it, he should be able ftomget an
educationat a rate he can pay,” he ‘
said. ' , '

A decision on Pitt’s allocation is
expected during‘ June."

Tuition:

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Questions surrounding the im-
pending tuition increase may have
taken another complicated turn

7 because of apparent connections

among the tuition -' hike, faculty

‘raalary increase and faculty unioni-

:"\,

According to University Senate

Council President Frank Slaughter, ‘

the size of an increase in faculty
salaries may be the deciding factor
in a faculty union vote during the
fall term. '

As Slaughter see it, 1_0% of the
faculty can be expected to swing
the decision" on faculty unioniza-
tion, a slim number that may be
affected by how the University
administration deals with a salary
increase‘.

The University has_ presented
four options for a tuition increase:
--15% tuition increase with a 5%

faculty salary increase.

--15% tuition increase with a 7.5%
faculty salary increase. _

--20% tuition increase with a 5%
faculty salary increase.

--20% tuition increase with a 7.5%
faculty salary increase.
Freeman has admitted the only

variables left in the tuition picture

are the size . of the state
appropriation, the tuition increase

and the faculty salary increase.

But the budget predictions
prepared for Pitt list tuition versus
faculty salary increase, and ac-

cording to those facts, a_7.5%.

faculty increase, offset‘ by only a
15% «tuition increase with no
appreciable increase in the State
appropriation, will drive Pitt into
the red. ,
However, a 20% tuition increase
with the same variables for faculty
salary and state funding will leave
Pitt with a comfortable balance of
surplus money, according to

V university figures.

The Mystery Deepens

So, the question now becomes
what is the administration willing
to do to offset‘ the chances for

faculty unionization at the Univer- ’

sity? g

Although no exact dollar ﬁgure is
available for legal. costs on union
cases, Vice-Chancellor for Planning
and Budget Jack Freeman ad-
mitted some of_those funds come
from a budget group set aside for
general legal costs, and that
spending on legal cases over-all
was a large sum, expected to
increase substantially next year.

The import of faculty unioniza--

tion may have a big impact on all
parts of the University, especially
on the ﬁnancial side. ‘

At Temple, faculty unionization
resulted in a negotiated 10% hike
in faculty salaries, a far cry from
the 5%-7.5% option administrators
are looking at for Pitt.

So, if the best weapon against
faculty unions is a sizable salary
increase (of 7.5%), and if the State

legislature balks at increasing-the _

allocation to the University, the
case for. a 20%.~tuition .increase
becomes a very tempting one
indeed. .

Given no state fund increase, a
distaste for faculty unions and a
need to maintain a comfortable
budget,‘the University may be
taking a longer look at the 20%
increase. ,

Lurki_ng closely behind the issue
of,whether or not President Ford
should have ordered a military
_ solution in the Mayaguez incident
F, ' fisthe more curious question of.
5-  2 daily rising casualties in an isolated
 _maneuver that has been over for a
';_ ‘week.

' Press wire releases termed the
/ losses heavy as the invasion was
' unfolding Wednesday evening, and
 so it was with great relief the next
5’ . morning that Americans accepted
”  the official tally of one dead, 8
 wounded. On Friday the count was
‘revised to’ two dead, 22 wounded,

' i and 13 missing. New figures
released Sunday set deaths at five,

_ wounded at 70 to 80. The latest

- " count shows 15 dead, 50 wounded,
and three missing.

Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger has called the ﬁghting
a complex operation, one in which
the final casualties are not
-available immediately. This is
understandable in the proper
context. Though the average
citizen is interested in the amount

_of casualties, no one expects them
while events are still runnin their
course. In the case of the
Mayaguez, however, the Pentagon
. has revised its counts several times
i x in as many days.

 

 

, This becomes very curious in
light of the brevity of the battle and
the limited force that took part in it.

No one needs to be reminded that
these are not the days of the weekly

hard to tell the Mayaguez count

death toll. ,

Though it is convenient to
dismiss the Pentagon’s continuous
revisions as part of the complex
government bureaucracy, it is also
dangerous to toss off the suspicions
surrounding the issue that are now
making themselves evident. ‘First
of all, why was the United States
not aware of two similar events
involving the ships of -other nations
off the Cambodian coast just two
weeks prior to the Mayaguez
seizure? Second, why did
President Ford order the Marine
invasion and the bombing of the
mainland when the release of the
Americans had been virtually
assured and when his legal experts
advised him that the Cambodians
had a legal right to seize the ship?

These questions, coupled with
the constant revision of the
casualty list seem to constitute an
exercise that was carried out in our
post-Vietnam lust for restored
pride and inﬂuence in Southeast
Asia. But the common denomi-
nator still exists, that no matter
what the Pentagon’s ﬁnal death toll
may be, no matter what amount of
face we save, a ﬁxed number of
men died on Kch Tang Island never
to rise again, in spite of counts and
recounts, because a president saw
their lives as something less
important than a country’s inter-
national self-image.

" One version’

BY CAL RITCHEY

A Letter to the Editor in
Sunday’s Pittsburgh Press termed
the Mayaguez incident “sabre-
rattling.” The letter was signed by
four Pittsburgh women.

The ladies were correct.
President ‘Ford’s reaction to the
Cambodian piracy of the merchant
ship was nothing more than
sabre-rattling. It was nothing less
than sabre-rattling, either.

America has been deprived of
rattling its sabres for some years
now. The Vietnam‘ thing--remem-
ber that one?--was an ill-fated
venture that succeeded only in
demoralizing Americans and con-
fusing the remainder of the world.
We came out of Vietnam uncertain
about our ability to survive in the
rough-and-tumble world of normal
international politics.

F.ord’s sharp handling of the
Cambodians put an end to that
confusion. The world now has seen
once again that we are as ready as
ever to defend our own sovereign-
ity, though we may be ‘a little less
swift -to encroach on someone else’s
territory than we did in Vietnam.

What is most perplexing about
the Mayaguez affair is the reaction
of otherwise sensible Americans, to
the action initiated by the White
House. A v

It was simply a matter of national
pride: Not since the Cuban

raises serious questions, questions
that have been buried under public

V acclaim for this show of American

strength in the wake of the
Indochina defeat.

The true details of the Mayaguez
operation have been only gradually
revealed--the operation was hardly
the military success it was trumped
up to be. And President Ford’s
actions were of questionable
legality and were even more
motivated.

» On May 18, Defense Secretary
James R. Schlesinger revealed that
American casualties for the Maya-

’ guez operation were ﬁve killed, 16

missing (and presumed drowned)
and 70 to 80 wounded. This is far
in excess of the earlier reports of
one killed, 22 wounded, and 13
missing. In addition to suffering
heavy casualties in the 300—man
operation, the Marines attacked
the wrong island. ,
The revised accounts of the
operation throw doubts on its
“unqualified” success--and on
governmental candidness and hon-
esty with the American press and
‘public. For instance‘, a New York
Times Story on May 18 reported
that a Pentagon spokesman ques-
tioned about discrepancies in
ofﬁcial accounts, disclosed that not
one but two jet attacks had been
directed against mainland Cam-
bodia sites. - _ . '
Two 1973 laws make the
President’s actions legally debat-
able. The War Powers _A_c_t_,
enacted despite President Nixon’s
veto, requires consultation , with
Congress before the President the
act’s provision requiring him to
report the results to Congress--but
he did not really consult with
Congress before he ‘took action,
although some leaders. "were
informed of his plans. _
A law banning American military
activity in Indochina after August
15, 1973, was passed in June 1973.
' And each additional defense
spending bill has contained similar
prohibitions‘ against American

heat of scorn resulting from our
all-but-defeat in Vietnam, sorely
needed something to show the
world that we would not be pushed
around--certainly not by a.’ tiny
two-bit Communist government
sitting in a rice ﬁeld halfway
around the world.

There should have been no
astonishment on the part of
Americans that the administration
took such decisive action. Indeed,
it would have been strange had
Ford and his advisors not moved
with such ﬁrmness. Pride is a
powerful initiator, in presidents as
well as peons.

Oddly, however, many Ameri-
cans seem to be astonished and
dismayed, disgusted, or even
angry that our Marines went in to
recover the Mayaguez. They seem
to forget that Cambodia was acting
much like the playground bully in
second grade--the kid who stole all
the marbles and threw the balls
over the fence into the creek, or
whatever.

There is only one moment when
the time is right to stop such
bullies. That time is the instant the
harassment begins. Right then,
sensible children--or wise adults--
will gang up on the offender and
come down like a ton of‘ bricks. '
Flatten a punk once and he won’t
bother anyone again, at least not
for a while.

President Ford did exactly that:
He decided, as my father used to
tell me, he was “going to cloud up
and rain_all over.” Rain he did,
and the cloudburst effectively awed
a lot of people around the world.

I agree with Ford’s actions. It
gave me a sense’ of satisfaction; it

Cambodia. Ford’s actions blatantly

, and ﬂagrantly violate these laws.

The results of the Mayaguez
operation'will not be all good for
the President. They certainly ‘_will
strain his relations with Congress
and Thailand, both of whose
sovereignity he has violated. So
what could motivate Ford to take
these potentially dangerous ac-
tions?

Not the rescue of the Mayaguez.

ship was “captured,” we had an
excuse to show the world that we

And then there are the time
factors in the announcement that
Cambodia would release the ship

on Wednesday) and almost simul-

Univ. Oratory:.Not Only a Place to Pray

MARY LINTZ

For the freshman, the feeling that
this strange place called Pitt is so
immense can be all too familiar.

Any student, though, can use a
little sympathy now and then, too,
and one of the best places‘ to find it
is at the University Oratory Parish.
Catholics, Protestants, Jews and
atheists alike are welcomed by
Fathers William Clancy, Nick de
Prospero, and Bran Summers.

“When the students are away
from home, they get the feeling

that they can do what they please.’

But at some point, they realize that
they can’t handle everything on
their own, and we hope some of
them will come to us,” says
Summers, who's been with the
Oratory in Pittsburgh for the past
four years. A

“,If they are having trouble find-
ing friends or realizing their place
in the University, we talk to them if
they call, and many times invite
them to the Oratory for dinner.
Here they can meet other students
who are also having these same,
difﬁculties, and they can help each
other to;adjust to university liv-
ing.”

The Oratory is actually the Con-
gregation of the Oratory of St.
Philip Neri of Pittsburgh and was
established by Bishop ~ John J.

Wright in 1961. There are three

Oratories  the United States--the
one in Pittsburgh, one in California

. and one in North Carolina. The

Congregation seeks to fulfill the
early Christian way of life, a
“retum to the early Christian idea
of community, and a rediscovery of
that community’s service to the
modern community of higher edu-
cation.”

Unlike the Newmans, a Catholic
group founded by Cardinal John
Newman with parishes on many
campuses thpoughout the United
States, the priests at the Oratory
are appointed by the diocese and
have their positions there for life.
Subsidization of the Oratorv and its
"priests also is taken care of by the
diocese.

“Our parish serves not only Pitt,
but Carnegie-Mellon and Chatham
as well,” Summers said. “There is

a Parish Council consisting of two _

CMU and three Pitt students, a
aculty representative, and repre-
sentatives from 25 families in the
community that are interested in
the goals 'and doings of the
Parish.”

This council, along with other
students, plans activities for the
Oratory, such as retreats, dinners
and hayrides, in addition to masses
and Bible studies, open to students
of any faith.

Masses are held at 7 pm Saturday,
and 10 am and 4 pm Sunday at the

-1.975-fHE:rNEws-rag  

   
  

Graduate School of Public Health’,

and at 11:30 am Sunday at ‘Heinzli
Chapel. Week-day masses are at

noon in Heinz Chapel.

Some students are reluctant to.
attend the folk masses at the.

because of the lack of familiar: 
Catholic Church surroundings, so 

they atend St. Paul’s Cathedral, in

Oakland on Fifth Avenue and Craig . 

Street. But Summers adds,

held in a strict was or a special
place,for the spirit of Christ is all 
around us.” 4. I ~

The priests are concerned. that ,4
many students who might like to.‘ :
participate and plan the events of‘ 

the Oratory feel they don’t have the
time. ' If more could participate,

more activities could be planned at 

many different times, so that those,
who‘ formerly could not ‘attent:
might be able to fit them between
their classes and studying. ‘ A

‘ ‘We're here for the students, and
many of them do aid in planning 
the music and readings in the]-
liturgy,” Summers said. The Ora- 
tory is located at 4040 Bigelow 

Boulevard and is a great place for

some to figure out a few things 7

about themselves. Try calling there

.,Sabres Cut Series 2-1  

BY FRANK BROWN
AP Sports Writer

—~“=BUFFALO AP--Members of
both the Philadelphia Flyers and
‘Buffalo Sabres had suggestions
.Wednesday for combating the fog
which settled over the Memorial
;Auditorium_ ice, ‘during Tuesday

 

'n_ight’s third game of.1he National /

Hockey League championship ser-
ies. ’

. “We’re all going to wear miner’-s
.he_lmets, the ones with ﬂashlights
on top, and we’re going to paint the
[pufck orange,” offered Flyers’
;-forward Terry Crisp.

7 ‘A "We’re all going to tie electric

',fans' to our backs and skate
around,” said Buffalo defenseman
Larry. Carriere.

 Hot, humid weather here caused
.the_ fog to form on the ice during
Buffalo’s S-4 overtime victory in
-Game Three. Play was halted 12
times during _the game’s later
stages as players skated .in circles
to try and thin the haze,which often
obstructed their view of the puck.

. 5 Sabres’ goalie Gerry Desjardins
-didn’t blame the weather for his
‘- ‘nightmarish first period, in which
‘(he appeared very shaky and
surrendered three easy goals.

   
   
 
  
   
  
  
 
   
  
 

 "‘Had I stayed in there, I would
have, lost the game,” said
‘Desjardins, who was replaced by
--Roger Crozier at the start of- the
‘F:-second period with the Flyers
 “leading 3-2. “It was a hopeless

f fcase, so before I_did any more

_ fgtdamage’, I took myself out.

 

_ “Had it been the regular season,
 I probably would have stayed in.
S 5 7 But when 20 guys are working
 ‘themselves to death to win the
 game,'_I didn’t want to waste their
' effort,” Desjardine said.

3-if Remy’s three-run home run, his
7 [first in the major leagues,
‘   highlighted a five-run fourth inning
and helped the California Angels
f~i:"whip the Cleveland Indians 12-S
7 '1  ‘Monday night.
39  ‘V, The Angels jumped on Cleveland
 starter Don Hood, 1-2, for three
' -*’;;_‘.runs in the first inning when Remy
. .. . ‘walked and scored on Dave Chalk’s
 ” triple, then Lee Stanton belted a
1 two-run homer. '

~'—-The Indians tied~i_t.in the second

   
 
 

The effort was Buffalo’s best of"
the series as they cut Philadel-
phia’s lead to 2-1 in the
best-of-seven Stanley Cup set
going into Game Four here
Thursday night.

‘‘It was a big win,” said Sabres’

. Coach Floyd Smith. Indeed, it was.

-“The triumph was Buffalo’s ﬁrst
over the Flyers in 15 meetings,
going back to March 28, 1973, and
it was their, first ever against
Philadelphia goalie Bernie Parent,
who faced 46 shots.

‘But you never have any
breathing room,” said Smith.

“We’ve won one, now we need
three more. Thursday nigl_1t’s a big
game. If we win that, it’s a
best-of-three series.”

Still both teams would be better
off if the game took a more
conventional turn than did Tuesday
nigh’t’sr contest. The unusual
proceedings began in the ﬁrst
period when a bat ﬂew out of its
belfry and, down to the ice surface.

After it had ﬂown perilously
close to some of the players,
Sabres’ forward Jim Lorentz
dispatched the creature with a swift
swipe of his hockey stick.

Then the game continued. Five
shots--three by Philadelphia and
two by Buffalo--banged off the
goalpost; ,Flyers’_ left wing Dave
Schultz nearly went into the stands
after a fan; and, of course, the
game went into overtime.

At 18:29 of the extra period, with
the clock racing toward midnight,
Buffalo right wing Rene Robert
slapped a 20-foot wrist shot past
Parent. The goal ended the longest
Stanley Cup playoff game in four
years and completed a most
unusual evening. -.

on a run-scoring double by- Frank
Robinson and a two-run single by
Buddy Bel. California starter Andy
Hassler was replaced by Dick
Lange, who pitched out of a
bases-loaded situation and went on
to record the victory, his first of the
year against one loss.
In the Angels fourth, Brue
Bochte hit a sacriﬁce ﬂy to score
Chalk and Bob Allietta scored on
‘Billy Smith’s single, giving the
Angels a 5-3 lead. Jim Perry came
on to relieve Hood and was greeted
by. Remy’sCthree-run homer.

Sports Editor

Whether you like the man or not,
Joe Paterno, head coach of Penn
State’s football team, ‘has a way to
turn even mediocre teams into bowl
game contenders. If he needs a.
man to ﬁll a vacated position, he
simply inserts a kid and, like
magic, he blossoms into a star.

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Until last night, their record was
4-1. They hold a first-place

standing in the Western Division .

of World Team Tennis and have
already blasted Boston 33-26,
Phoenix 26-22 and San Francisco
26-15. And last time, they
narrowly defeated the Pittsburgh
Triangles 25-24.’ '

That’s the Los Angeles Strings,
led by Rosie Casals, player-coach.

Well,_things were not so rosy

when the Tri’s beat the Strings by a A

mere one point last night, 22-21.

. Evonne Goolagong, the match’s ‘
heroine, swept the women’s events
in play, including a 6-0 shutout‘

against Bettyann Stuart. It_ was
Goolagong-’s best performance of
the season. -

After winning both “women’s

events,“the Tri’s had a 12-3 lead,
but they lost the final three sets.

Luckily, they still wonthe match on
the merit of the, large , winning

, scores in the women’s sets.

The team of Goolagong and
Peggy Michel beat Casals and
Kathy Harter. 6-3 in women’s
doubles. Goolagong was fast and
displayed great mobility in the
returns.‘ Casals was equally as
good.

The Strings’ weak spot was
Harter. She played slowly and was
reluctant to chase balls that
weren’t close to her. As a result,
the Strings lost points, then games
and finally the set.

In women’s singles, ' Goolagong
won big over Stuart, 6-0. The set
opened with little competition.
Later the competition increased as
tough plays and long volleys
appeared. But Stuart was no match
for Goolagong, who played with the
same versatility she showed in the
opening set. Stuart played harder
the last time against Nancy Gunter,
who narrowly won 7-6 in a tie
breaker for the Tri’s.

“I’m very, satisfied with
.Evonne’s performance tonight. I
did not expect her to win 6-0 ‘in
singles,” said Vic Edwards, the
Tri’s coach.

The Tri’s first set loss came in
men’s doubles when Geoff Masters
and Ross Case beat Vitas Gerulaitis
and Mark Cox 6-4.x Cox played
superbly, returning balls that
looked impossible to return.
Masters made some great returns
with the backhand and was
unbelievably fast. The dynamic
‘duo of Masters and Case is the best
men’s doubles teamto play at the

_'Ci_vi_c Arena so far; " .- ' . /
rred

. ‘ disadva_ntage_s‘-

This spring the man has been at
work again trying to fill the gaps
left by graduation. He has come up
with switches involving seven
lettermen and two others who saw
limited action last year.

The lettermen who were switch-
ed to different positions were Ron
Coder, offensive guard to defensive

tackle; Randy Sidler, tight end to.

outside Linebacker; Ron Crosby,
inside linebacker to defensive end;
Kurt Allerman, inside linebacker to
defensive end; Jeff Hite, defensive
halfback to outside
George Reihner, offensive guard to
offensive tackle; and Mike John-
son, safety to defensive halfback.
The other two players to be
moved are Dave Stutts, running
back to tight end, an_d Rod Zur,
defensive halfback to split end.
Patemo is looking for thebest
adjustment to the switch from
Coder, a 6-3‘/2, 232-pound senior
not recruited by the Nittany Lions.

A resident. of State College, I

Coder was a walk-on, a rarity in
this day of super recruitment. Last
year in his old position as offensive
guard,‘he was one of the mainstays

linebacker; j

He
was moved to defense this year to
replace All-American graduate
Mike Hartenstine.

Hite was a student in the Lion’s
secondary and played his best ball
of the season against the Maryland
Terrapins--he returned an inter-
ception for a 79-yard touchdown
and intercepted a lateral for a..§;r“\'\;..,:
21-yard score. It’s a shame this ‘ 
one got‘ away from Pitt, for Hite
went to high school at Pittsburgh's
North Catholic. '

Johnson was the regular safety-

rnan during’ the second half of last

season, sharing the job with Tom _ 3
Giotto for the first ﬁve games.
Patemo "hopes the move from
safety to halfback in the secondary
will not be much of a problem.
Sidler» was one of two freshmen
who earned varsity letters last year
for the Lions. In going from tight
end to linebacker, he returns to his
high school position.
Although the moves don’t seem
too critical at the moment, Paterno
is counting on the. small adjust-

»ments to keep .the Lions from "-

slipping into mediocrity this year.

Strings Plucked by Goolagong 

The Triangle’s Evonne Goolagong

in men’s singles when Bob Lutz
bombed Gerulaitis 6-2. Last time,
it was Gerulaitis, who blitzed ‘Lutz
6-0. — ‘ " '

“I was hitting the ball well,”
Lutz said. “Vitas is mainly an
aggressive player. I just tried to
overpower him.”

Casals added,
extremely well. He seems more
comfortable now. Last time, he
was a little nervous playing in his
first set in team tennis.
tonight Lutz was -3-1 in singles.”

“Lutz played

In mixed doubles, Casals and
Masters overpowered Michel and
Kim Warwick, 6-4. Warwick

continued his powderkeg serves as’

he won two of his three games.
Twice he made two consecutive
aces, and he had many spikes.
Masterand Casals played harder,
winning the last three. games,
whichgave them the set.

After the match, Casals criticized

Frank Fuhrer, owner‘ of the Tri’s,.
for allowing the Arena’s roof to be

opened. “The rules state this is to
be indoor tennis to be played with
-roughly the same facilities in each
city. I do not consider this (the
opened roof) indoor, but outdoor
tennis. .

She then criticized the game’s
attendance of 1,571: ".‘Pittsburgh
has the worst attendance in the
tennis league. It should have been

the top name players they have.”

The Strings ‘are now‘ 4-2, but .
Casals. believes the team will .
remain in first place throughout the . -- =

last year, we are a hell of a team.

BY M. C. PILECKI

The staple of the movie industry
has always been the love story: boy
meets girl, boy loses girl, audience
cries a lot.

But with most love stories the
audience leaves misty-eyed but
feeling cheated, as their emotions
have been played upon cheaply and
with every old trick in the book;
You’ve seen them all: lovely young
girl contracts mysterious malady;
handsome young lad sacriﬁces all
and wins ‘got loses, it doesn’t much
matter) after many hardships and,

-5/“T;-‘4QtS of masochistic wallowing, the

h
v-.
\

forces (liike parents, for instance) ,
that kept the lovers apart now see i’

their error and let true love take its
course, etc. etc. For all the crying,
you can get an onion much more
cheaply.‘

So what -do the cynical--and still
sentimental--moviegoers have thzﬁ
won’t insult their sensibilities an
cost them a fortune in hankies?
Claude Lelouch usually comes up
with something, like A Man and a
Woman and Happy New Year, to
portray the favorite human drama
without getting maudlin aboutit.

His latest, And Now My Love, is
(without getting embarassed about
it) a beautiful love story. Now,

_don’t get turned off. This is no

‘Cheap shot.

Rather, Lelouch’ has taken a
unique approach to “love at ﬁrst
sight,” establishing, the three
generations of life and love that
lead up to that climactic moment,
which is, of course, the end of the
story.

The two principal characters,

..~‘,7:~‘*~when ﬁrst presented, are at totally

different’ ends of the spectrum.
She is the spoiled only daughter of
a wealthy Jewish businessman,
who for his daughter’s “Sweet 16”
party hired the most popular singer
in-France; he is a poor, orphaned
thief, stealing an”album of the
singer. .

Naturally, events change the two '

of them in the 15 or so years until
they meet." Lelouch keeps dangling
the two in front of the audience,

1--E’, . ..—.e~\vvho clearly can see that “love at

 

first sight” is on the way: the two
are “made” for each other. There

are so many possibilities for chance.
