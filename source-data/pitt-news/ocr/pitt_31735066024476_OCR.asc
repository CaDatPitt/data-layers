Advising Cente

By MARY KAN E

Pitt News Staff Writer

The undergraduate advising cen-
ter and other university services will
be reduced or eliminated because of
major budget cuts targeted for the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS),
Dean Jerome Rosenberg told
faculty members and advisors at
Tuesday’s FAS meeting.

The FAS is expected to cut nearly

$1.3 million from its budget by fiscal A

year 1982, Rosenberg said.

“l't’s true we will" be reducing the
size of.the advising center," Rosen-
berg said. “This will place an
increased burden on faculty
members for advising tasks.

“Any reduction is difficult. But in
order to reach the budget reality, I
have to do it.” V‘

However, Dean lrwin Schulman
of the College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS), said after the meeting that
these cuts will seriously compromise
the stature of the university as a
research institution. _

”the effects will be damaging in
terms of our ability to. hold on to
students,” he said.

“Decisions have to bemade, and V

people‘ have to be willing to take the

heat. Dean Rosenberg has courage.
.in that regard. There’s going to be

blood on the floor, and it’s a ques-

tion of whose blood." '
Sources involved in the budget

process indicated other effects of the

funding reduction may include elim-‘P

inating part time instructors, reduc-
ing the number of teaching
assistants and teaching fellows, clos-
ing down some doctoralprograms
and freezing faculty hiring.
Schulman said that there are

other university areas that could be

Frats and Landlords Found Guilty

By SUE MCFARLAND

Pill News Staff Writer

Four Pitt fraternities and their
landlords have been found guilty of
zoning violations’ after allegedly
operating fraternity houses in areas
of Central Oakland designated by
city zoning codes for commercial
properties.

The fraternities cited were: Kappa
Alpha Psi, Lamda Chi Alpha, Pi
Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Sigma.
Each fraternity and their landlors
were dealt individual fines deter-
mined by the severity ofthe offenses.

Lamda Chi Alpha, located on
Semple Street, was fined $1000, with
$900 of that fine suspended. Pi
Kappa Phi was fined $50 while
Kappa Alpha_'Psi and Phi Beta
Sigma, /both located on McKee
Place, were ordered to file with the
city for occupancy permits. ’

All four fraternities were ordered
to meet with the City and Peoples
Oakland, a community action
group, to iron out alleged com-
plaints that area residents have filed
against the fraternities. These com-
plaints ranged from residents who
were angry about garbage being
thrown in their lawns following par-
ties, to residents who claim the fra-

ternities have- “loud.pa'rties that go _

l

on all night.”

Many of the fraternities protested
the fines, stating that they were not
operating fraternities out of their

. South Oakland -apartments.

“ltjust happened that a couple of
the brothers from the same frater-
nity lived in the ‘same apartment,”
said Bill Stover of Pi Kappa Phi.
“There were actually only two
brothers living in the place.

“Before the hearing, the City sent

an. inspector out to look over the
place." Stover said. “As far as he was

Pitt Prof Advises Reagan Team

By TIM UHRICH

Whether advising President
Ronald Reagan on major scientific
and technological issues, or helping
a graduate student plot the future of
our country’s oil and energy supp-
lies, Dr. James C. Fletcher has taken
a most important and integral place
in the University of Pittsburgh aca-
demic community.

Dr. Fletcher holds the Whiteford
Chair of Technology and Energy
Resources, a professorship endowed
by the Gulf Oil Corp., and for 3'/;_
years has directed a myriad of
energy-related programs from his
llth floor office in Benedum Hall.

The most recent achievement for
the former NASA Administrator
and University of Utah president
was his appointment as an agency
captain on President Reagan’s tran-
sition team. As one of 40 captains,.
Dr. Fletcher was responsible for
developing future policy guidelines"
for the National Science
Foundation.

And, as was the case with most of
the agency captains, President Rea-
gan offered Dr. Fletcher the oppor-
tunity to serve in a high—level
government capacity. But this time
there were more important things to
be done.

There was his work in the Master
of Energy Resources Program at the
University of Pittsburgh, and the
research to be done at the school’s
Center for Energy and Environ-
ment. There were his responsibilities
to many of the nation’s most presti-
gious academies, institutes and
foundations for scientific and tech-
nological studies. I

“Naturally I was quite honored to
be chosen to Reagan’s transition
team,” Dr. Fletcher said. “And, of
course, every team member was
offered an interview for some future-
job in the administration.

“But I told them right away that I
wasn’t interested. You must under-

stand that most people rise through V

government into private industry. I

-just didn’t want to_go back, like

continued from page one
“It doesn’t seem quite right that

the SGB approves their own

, budget,” Clarke said.

“Don’t bring that up right now,"
Abraham said. “That is something

that has to be changed
constitutionally.” '

SGB’s budget was then voted on
and passed.

In addition to SGB, the commit-
tees whose budgets were approved
included Academic Affairs, Alloca-

' tions, Commuter Affairs, Elections, '

Governmental Relations, and Judi-
cial Board. , _

These committees were responsi-
ble for submitting budget requests to
the Allocations Corrimittee, which
reviewed the requests prior to Mon-
day’s meeting. The Allocations
Committee then submitted recom-
mendations for allocations to SGB.
for the final vote on the budget
requests.

‘Cap’ (Weinberger) and some of the
other people on the committee.”

Fletcher’s career in government
spanned a six-year period, but what
he accomplished in that time was
probably the most significant work
undertaken in our space program. It
was in that period that Fletcher
became the fourth man to head the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, appointed by Presi-
dent Richard Nixon in February,
l97l.

“Naturally, with that experience, I
was able to interface on an advisory
capacity with the NASA transition
team,” Dr. Fletcher said.

But as captain of the NSF team,
he was charged with three particular
duties—-produce a paper listing the
major issue, make suggestions on
personnel and appointments, and
make recommendations on the
budget. '

 

”Yoa knew what he
wanted, and he emphas-
ized it throughout his

campaign—lceep the
government out of the
_ people's hritches/'.
—Dr. ]ames C.
Fletcher

“It wasn‘t hard carrying out these
duties,” Fletcher reﬂected. “You had
to keep in mind what the president-
elect’s philosophies were when mak-

“This was simple. You knew what
he wanted, and he emphasized it

throughout his campaign--keep the .

government out of the people’s
britches.”

One important area was the early
education of our primary and
secondry school students. He disco-
vered that children were being
taught certain sociologies and ideals
at quite a young age.

“Here we are, teaching someone
else’s philosophies to children at
such an early stage. We just had to
really determine whetheror not we
were brainwashing these children

v with some of our ideas,” he said:

“We also had" to examine the edu-
cation of our engineering students.
-under the previous administration,
we found we weren’t turning out
enough engineers. But with the res-
urgence of the space program and
other scientific programs, we’re now

finding ourselves in need of more
engineers with a better quality edu-
cation," he said. .

There was also the scientific and
technological relationships estab-
lished by Nixon in the I974 summit
meetings. “How far should the NSF
progress with these agreements
under the new administration?” Dr.
Fletcher asked.

With a degree in physics from
Columbia University in 1940, Dr.
Fletcher started his career as a
research physicist with the U.S.
Navy Bureau of Ordinance at Port
Townshend, Wash. From there, he
went to Harvard as a research assist-
ant, and then to Princeton to
become a teaching fellow and earn
his master’s degree in physics in
I942. , A

After completing his doctorate in
physics at the California Institute of
Technology, he joined Hughes Air-
craft in California, and as head of
the theory and analysis laboratory,
he was instrumental in developing
the Falcon air-to-air missle and the

F-102 all-weather interceptor. _
From there, he joined Ramo-

Wooldridge Corp. in the electronics
and guided missle division, which
grew into Space Technology Labor-
atories. There, Dr. Fletcher aided in
the development of all United States
intercontinental ballistic missles and
helped initiate Pioneer 4, the
nation’s first space probe.

In I958, Dr. Fletcherand an asso-
ciate formed Space Electronics Cor-
poration in Glendale, Calif.,
developing the Able Star stage for
the Thor-Able space carrier. This
company merged and eventually
evolved into Space General Corp.,
an organization he served as its first
president, and eventually chairman

of the board.
In I964, he returned to academic

life to become the University of
Utah’s eighth president, a post he
held for seven years. During that
time, the university experienced its
greatest growth period, both in
physical facilities and academic
qualities.

Then, in l97l, he left the univer-‘
sity_ to accept the NASA appoint-
ment for six years, leaving there for
executive positions with both the
Burroughs Corporation and Stand-
ard Oil Company of Indiana. ,

But in order to continue his
research and become involved" in
energy management, Dr. Fletcher
accepted the Whiteford Chair pro-
fessorship at Pitt in. 1977.

“There are two reasons I accepted.
this position,” Dr. Fletcher indi-
cated. “First I wanted to study the
energy problem,
wanted to discover the relationships
between technology and productiv-
ity in the energy field. I

“As far as the energy policy, we
have to find what we can do to com-
bat our energy problem,” he said.
“This includes discovering ways to
minimize the OPEC impact, and
finding how we can make the transi-
tion to non-oil forms of energy
before the world oil supply runs out
in the yer 2020.”

Chancellor Wesley Posvar
reported to the Senate Council at
Monday‘s meeting that discussions
will be held to develop a five year
plan that will insure that the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences budget cuts will
be at the.expense of quantity, not
quality.

Posvar said all the schools have
had budget cuts over the past five
years and some are having problems
such as the School of Education,
which has a shortage of manpower.
FAS is doing better than most, he
added.

Posvar said, "we must ﬁx quality
at the expense of quantity” and
added that, although budget cuts
would necessitate a l0 to I5 percent
smaller faculty, the university must

- The Reagan administration’s pro-
posed cuts in funding for the
National Science Foundation (NSF)
will. have a crippling effect on educa-
tion, according to a spokesman in
Congressman Doug Walgren’s
office.

As a result of the cuts, “what you
destroy in one year in the way of
unthinking budget cuts—-could
take a decade to restore."

The cuts are aimed primarily at
college research, international
science programs, science and engi-
neering education, and university

which was to begin May l in Pitts-
burgh, Philadelphia, and the

program, which was mandated by a
1978 court-approved consent decree
among the state, the Environmental
Protection Agency, and the Dela-
ware Valley Citizens for Clean Air,
could be delayed for 20 months until
January I983 following a request by
Governor Thornburg last month.

in addition to. the chancellor’s
report, a report from the Senate
Committee on Tenure and Aca-
demic Freedom was submitted by
the committee‘s co-chairpersons,
Barbara K. Shore and Sanford
Golin. The report was an amend-
ment which called for the appoint-
ment of special non-voting members
to the Appeals Panel in alleged dis-
crimination cases.

Golin explained that since the
members of the Appeals Panel are

chosen by lot, there is a possibility.

that none of the members chosen
would belong to the same minority
group as the person who is request-
ing the appeal in an alleged discrimi-
nation case. Therefore, he said, thge
amendment would give the appe]-
‘am the option of requesting two

laboratories," which he said is “a
real concern among scientists.”

He said Walgren feels the position
of the United States in the world
depends on science.

The spokesman cited testimony
by Astronomer Carl Sagen during
recent NSF hearings, that it takes
years to develop the scientiﬁc and
academic resources to teach stu-
dents to be scientists.

Walgren is chairman of the house
subcommittee on science, research
and technology.

The current budget for the foun-
dation is 1.007 billion dollars, and
the I982 budget is expected to be

Plan for FAS —

aiiditional non-voting advisers to be
drawn from a special minority pool.

An update on the progress of the
draft document on the Review of
Academic Administrators was pres-
ented by Richard Pratt. The Dean
of The Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
Jerome Rosenberger said that
administration is ready to start
working on the language of the doc-
ument but there was some concern
among the deans and the provost
concerning the confidentiality of the
final report on the evaluations.

He ‘said that the deans and pro-
vost suggested that a semi-public
report should be developed so the
university community would have
some kind of feedback on the results
of an evaluation, while the identityu
of sources used in the process and
the dignity of the administrator
would still be protected.

Cuts ‘ Crippling’ to Education

about 1.026 billion, the spokesman
said. He added, “although there is an
overall increase,a 12-1 3 percent hike
is needed to keep pace with
-inflation.”

Actual reductions for the agency,
below the base level set by the Carter
administration, call for $63 million
in 1982 and $66 million in l983.,

“Congressman Walgren is partic-

ularly concerned with our position
in the world as it relates to science,”
the spokesman said. Walgren said
recently that Japan has turned out as
many engineers in the past two
decades as the ‘United States, with
half the population.

Debateon/luto Emissions Control

at 7 p.m. to meet with members of
the media.

According to Lanard, the Dela-
ware Valley Citizens’ Council for
Clean Air opposes any delay. “The
delay in implementing the l/ M pro-
gram will result in continued human
exposure to unnecessarily high lev-

els of health-threatening air pollu- '

tants, increased gasoline
consumption and fewer opportuni-
ties for businesses to expand their
operations." He will discuss alterna-
tive clean air programs which would
have to be developed before there
could be agreement to delay the 1/ M

Reag.an’sBtudget:GunsNot Butter

WASHINGTON AP - Ronald
Reagan‘s answer to the classic
either-or question on government
spending is a resounding “Guns.”

Not that he’s against butter. He
just doesn’t think the government
should pay for it.

Reagan, in fact, advocates a richer
life for consumer America. And he
would lower, not raise, the federal
taxes even as he seeks a military
buﬂdup.

But he would cut out $2.3 billion
in food stamps for thousands of
Americans and, in effect, usethat
money as a down payment on a new .
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, a

new cruiser and new submarines for
the U.S. Navy.

He would reduce unemployment i

insurance benefits by'$—l.5 billion,
and ticket that amount for McDon-
nell Douglas,' General Dynamics,
Sikorsky Aircraft and others to buy
more F-I5 and F-I6 fighter planes,
dozens of new helicopters, and new
tankers to refuel them.

. And he would cut back the stu-
dent loan program and use that $700
million or so to speed up purchases
of the new XM-I tanks.

These few examples underscore
the most dramatic theme of the

Reagan budget for the 1982 fiscal '

Tuesday for Atlanta where they
hope to set up street patrols to pro-

They departed Pennsylvania Sta-
tion in mid-afternoon and were to
arrive in Atlanta at 7 a.m.

The red-bereted group at first had
planned to hitchhike, but a patron,
Allen Stein, a garment manufac-
turer, gave them train fare. _

He explained he felt that “the
situation in Atlanta has become an
American tragedy.” ' .

added, they may eventually

“'When‘you' put a kid to sleep on

Hal A. Huggins, a dentist from
Colorado Springs, Colo., said in an
interview during the 50th annual
Liberty Dental Conference here. ‘

‘‘I used to look at kids and say,
‘Your teeth are too bigfor your

Toyota Price-Fixing Hits State   

Harrisburg AP—An East Coast car

A distributor’ and 48 Pennsylvania .
dealers inﬂated theprices of Toyotas

in a statewide price-fixing conspi-
racy, Attorney General LeRoy Zim-

.merman charged Tuesday.

in a suit filed. in  District
Court here, Zimmerman said more
than 10,000 Pennsylvanians have
been overcharged for a “protective
package" since September 1979. He
said they had no choice but to buy it.

Total damages in the antitrust
action. could reach more than'$l5
million, Zimmerman said. Prelimi-
nary and permanent injunctions

have been requested, alongwith a

jury trial.

Similar lawsuits have been filed in
Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia
and the District of Columbia, and

Virginia is consideringfsuch an ,

action, Zimmerman said. ~

.. The Pennsylvania lawsuit charges
that “substantially all” of the Toyota
sales during the period in question
contained a non-negotia-ble “protec-

The alleged scheme has resulted in

Toyota prices that are “fixed,'raised,
maintained or stabilized at artificial

and noncompetitive levels," the suit _

contends. _ ,_

It says Pennsylvania customers
have been denied the right to pur-
chase the cars without the protective
package, and‘ the lower prices that
might have resulted from “free and

open competition among Toyota ,

dealers.”

The lawsuit also claims that price
competition‘ among dealers has been
restrained, as has competition
among authorized and independent
rustproofeis, soundproofers, and
others. '

Damascus. Syria-Hijackers
holding more than 100 hostages on a
Pakistani airliner scaled down their

_ deadline for freeing political prison-

ers, Syrian and Pakistani official
said. '
Negotiators sought a compromise

. settlement that would free hostages

and political prisoners simultane-
ously. The Boeing 720, seized nine
days ago over Pakistan and taken

first to Kabul, Afghanistan. and
then Damascus, rested on an auxil-
ia-ry runway here surrounded by
Syrian police cars.

Three Americans and two alien

U.S. residents were among the hos-
tages, described as increasingly ner-
vous as the ordeal continued.

The three heavily armed sky-
jackcrs set 2 p.m. Syrian time, Wed-
nesday. 7 a.m. EST for Pakistan’s

military government to release the‘

prisoners, officials said.

But S.yria’s chief negotiator, Brig.
Gen. Mohammed Kholi, said the
young hiiackers scaled down their

demands, reducing the number of
opposition activists they want freed
in Pakistan from 92.to 45.

The general told reporters at
Damascus airport he washopeful a
compromise would be reached and
the ordeal of the captives would

. “soon be over."

Kholi said» the Pakistani govern-
ment also made'“new proposals" to
keep the negotiations with the
hijackers alive. He would not dis-
close these proposals but sources at
the Damascus airport control tower
said Islamabad authorities offered
to release 22 political prisonersin

Washington—The Reagan adminis-
tration is debating an order that
would let the CIA use ‘break-ins,
physical surveillance and secret infil-
tration to collect foreign intelligence
from Americans and U.S. corpora-

‘ tions who are neither, suspected of

crimes or of being foreign agents,
according to a documeittobtained
by The Associated Press.

The draft presidential order also
would let =the CIA infiltrate certain
domestic groups for the purpose of
altering their activities.

On Tuesday, at a rare public brief-
ing at CIA headquarters deputy CIA
director Bobby R. Inman said a
“changing world“ has prompted the
Reagan administration to explore
whether to rescind ‘some limits to
CIA spying within the United

States.

lnman said the administration has ,

launched an intensive study of legal
and other barriers to intelligence

- operations to see if some can be

removed by the summer to combat
international terrorism and improve
counterintelligence.

Inman did not disclose any of the

‘ documents underdiscussion but he

stressed they were in a very early
stage and that much internal debate
is anticipated before any proposals
are forwarded to President Reagan
for his approval. But he predicted
that therewill be changesin the rules
governing intelligence agencies.
The document obtained by The
AP showed initial thinkingwould
remove. many restrictions on-CIA
domestic activity. The draft presi-
dential order removes the require-

‘Tuesday. “They’ll eat the weedsvand the trash and even fertilize the lawns.” I

But is it legal for goats to graze within city limits? . —

p “The goats will be exempt from zoning ordinances because they will be city '

And he has a scheme that might offset the goats’$50 to $75 purchase price. ‘

  Saying   Who
t Lives or Dies

“Why must we kill someone who killed someone to .
prove that killing is wrong?” This is the cry that has
been heard around the country in-recent days, similar
to those prior to Gary Gilmore’s execution. But this
time, the capital punishmentquestion focused on the
case of Stephen Judy. ‘ .

Judy’s execution has only served, sadly, as another
. - step backward for the justice and penal system of the
 United States.
it It is a step backward because it is a brutal and
 inconclusive end precipitated by a system whichforced
 , itself into a_ capital punishment situation. The execu-
tion provided no answers or solutions. Guilt or inno-
cence was not a question; there was no doubt to Judy’s
guilt in the rape-murder of the 21 year old mother and
the panic-murder of her three children“./The conun-
drum'is: Why were themurders allowed to happen?
,, This dilemma is reflective of a justiceesystern that
3" - seems forever in the process of chasing its own tail. It is
 a system that is attempting to establish safety and

justice by reaching back and sweeping dirt over the
blood that is trailingbehind it. Of course, much of this
is conjecture,‘ but it would be reasonably safe to say
that, had the penal system been adequate to ensure
that a recidivist such as Judy "not return to the street,
four people might still be alive today. It is not conjec-
ture, however, to say that Judy has been punished, and
his four victims are still dead. The justice system has
the blood of ﬁve murders on its hands, rather than

four. ' _ A
A One must keep a proper persp.ectiv'e when attacking
the capital punishment question, especially when the
focus of the fervor is someone such as Judy. No one is

martyring or pitying him: he is a murderer. His patho- -
logical portrayal in the press made him practically
. detestable, for he seemed to have no regret or'remorse.-
Judy was a sick’man just as Gary Gilmore, -John
Wayne Gacy, Charles Manson, Edwardlsurrat and
countless others were sick men. But for their illness,

. the justice system says that they have to_ be killed. /

I

How we can accept and function within this gross,
paradox is another-myistery. The very act that we
condemn as heinous and deviate is turned around and_
used as ceremony for their punishment. if human life
means so little to these men, then how can the threat of
losing their own act as a deterrent?

Corrective measures must be directed at the. penal
system of this country. Men like Judy cannot always
be corralled before taking live_s and embittering fami-
lies, but they can bepermanently contained. A life
sentence should'be.just that: life in confinement.

It breaks down to a question of priorities and princi-
ples., Under the government of the U.S., these people

_ are free. When_they break the law, there is a justice
"system ready to revoke that freedom. But until the
justice system begins creating human lives, they‘ should
not feel that they have‘ the power to take those lives
away. , 3 « . ' I H - ' _

Healthline— — — — —— — --E -—

The staff from the Student Health
Service will answer some ofthe most
commonly asked health-related

uestions from, Pitt students.
Anyone witha question can deposit
the inquiry in the COMPLAINT
BOX in the lobby of the Student
Health Service, 204 Brackenridge
Hall, or slip it under the door of the
Student Health Advisory Boards
office, 315 Student Union. We invite
anyone with an interest in the medi-
cal field to join the’ Board and
become part of Pitt’s health care
team!

I often get’ cramps during my

period. Usually they last only for a-

day, but they can get pretty severe
sometimes. Is there anything I can
do to eliminate the pain?_

Many women have cramps (dysme-
norrhea) during ‘menstruation. This
discomfort, which is not imaginary,
may be severe enough. to cause a
woman to spend a day or two in bed.
This can. be very frustrating if it
means missing classes.

Generally, dysmenorrhea symp-
toms are'divided into two types: con-
gestive andl spasmodic. Some
women experience symptoms of

both types; others experience either .

congestive or_ spasmodic symptoms,

only. . * .
iln congestive dysmenorrhea, the

\

symptoms result from the body’s
tendency to retain fluids atthis time.
Treatment is directed at decreasing
this tendency to retain ﬂuid. These

measures would “include. cutting.

back on salt(sodium) intake for 7-10
days before the period, eating foods
that are natural diuretics, increasing
potassium intake about ‘a week
before the periodand eating a high
fiber diet which will reduce the pos-
sibility of constipation.

Treatment for spasmodic dysme-
norrhea would include: muscle ton-
ing excercises to ‘strengthen the
pelvic area muscles, abdominal mas-
sage or a heating pad to increase
circulation to the pelvic area and

increasedrelaxation of muscles and L.

"medication which acts as an analge-
sic/prostaglandin inhibitor. Birth
control pills are also known - to
relieve cramps. "

Women who continue to have "

pain with each period in spite of

these measures should be examined *

by a clinician to rule out the possibil-
ity of pelvic pathology. '

Is the Birth Control Pill harmful?

Just as ‘with any medication, the
birth control ,pill can be potentially
harmful. Before a womancan start
taking the Pill, she must have a com-
plete medical examination. This
check-upifis to_ make sure that she

does not have any health problems
which would make taking the Pill

dangerous for her. The clinician will .

also want to know about her past
medical history as well as the medi-
cal history of her family. .

' Even after having a thorough eva-
luation, some women develop side
effects while on the Pill. Some of
these ar_e.minor, others are major,
and some are life threatening.
Serious side effects are rare but pos-
sible,
smokes and is 35 years of age or
older. These include blood clots,
heart attacks and strokes. Liver
tumors, hypertension (high blood
pressurae) and migraine headaches
are other major side effec_ts. There
maybe nuisance side effects, such as
weight gain or loss, mood changes

and breakthrough bleeding. The ,
long-term effects of the Pill are still '

unknown. ,

\

In order that a woman take the
Pill with relative" safety, if is impor-
tant that she have periodic check-
ups and report any suspected
reactions to her clinician imme-

diately. Because of the numerous '

Pill studies thatghave beentdone, it
can be’ cohcluded that- for most
healthy young women, the benefits“
of birth control pill_use‘continue'to

loutweight th‘e risks. ,

The Pitt News, 'Wednesda_y, March 11, 1981

by THOM PALMER
Co-Editor, The Pitt News

What value is given to the sacred
quality of human life? An honest,gut
answer would probably be; imme_as-
urable. This is said with the under-
standing that ‘honest’ means ‘to the
best of one’s knowledge, void of nai-
vete’ and ‘gut’ means ‘a truthful
impulse as to way things should be.’

‘ This’ is, unquestionably, very
In order to diffuse the
cloud of ambiguity that hangs over
this question, it is perhaps best to
throw more tangible observations
out for analysis. While it will be vir-
tually _impossible to rectify some-
thing such as “value” (already so
concretely termed as “immeasura-
ble”), we might be able to gain a
perspective on when this respect is or
is not accorded.
Preservation

For the second time in two weeks,
surgeons at Presbyterian University
Hospital have performed a liver

transplant. The long—range- success \

- of these bounds made in the medical
field cannot yet be determined: But
oneof the most striking characteris-

Q/_~, tics of these developments is the

strict discipline and perseverance of
people like Dr. Thomas Starzl. Pur-
pose and .motivation should be
pushed aside; the miracle of the
man’s work in the field becomes
important with the outcome. _
Whether or not the work of men
like Starzl attain a success rate that
is acceptable tothe medical field and
the populace is overshadowed by the
sheer power ofthe immediate break-
through. It tells us that hours upon
hours of pain and dedication are
being spent throughout the world,’
and most recently in our area, to
hold onto. human life. These said
hours .'could never match the value
of what they are striving to preserve,-

_ but it is a warm thought to know

QJ

that people of such intelligence are
working toward upholding the qual-
ity of life. ‘
Destruction

It is the second and final category.
It is a dominant feature of our news
pages, a pivotal theme‘ of our art,

A .Ways,.,
A Means,

A Paradox

and a misunderstood tragedy to
each of us when it happens to those
people with whom _we surround
ourselves. .

Butat the same time Dr. Starzl is
saving lives, there is a potential for
the loss of many more.

In order to save dollars and shave
debts, President Reagan is going to
unnecessary extremes. There is a
noose of budget cuts thatiis being
slipped over the neck ofthe Occupa-
tional Safety and'Health Adminis-
tration. His federal hiring freeze
immobilizes the efforts of the
organization.

What will this do to safety mea-
sures with industry? Although, at its
inception,’ OSHA was mildly critic-
ized for being overzealous, their
function and procedure only worked
toward a common ‘end: ensuring
safeguards for workers. Now they
are threatened with impotency due
to budget slashing. The, worker is
again out on the limb‘; asked to be
productive, asked to be frugal, asked
to do these aforementioned things at
their own risk.

Miners, also, are up in arms.
Thirty million dollars of their black
lung benefits are threatened with
being red-inked, and while irate ral-
liers have left the mines closed, the
president has made it clear that his
proposals‘ are not yet over. Should
more need. to be cut,‘ more will be

A cut. What organization will be next

to take’ up their banner to keep’
themselves, alive? . V ‘i
But to portray President Reagan
as the Grim Reaper-as he sweeps
through government spending is a A
bit rash. The possible effects, how-
ever, of these -measures, cannot be ‘
brushed aside, minimized,.«or even
temporarily reduced to a lower
priority level. Were one miner to die
because of inability to receive benef-
its, or one-'factor\y worker to die
because of negligence that could

  The Issue of the Innerstruggle

I have been caught or corrected by a
now-absent OSHA inspector, then
the president's budget measures are
wrong, deplorable, extreme. The
quality of life is’ not measured by
surviving masses. One death is as
tragic and inequitable as a thousand
tragic deaths. 4

Is it wrong to acknowledge the
impression that this is what our
government so vehemently sup-
ports? We spoke out for human
rights, and human rights became an
“issue.” Human rights is not an
issue. It is an unquestionable, non-
speculative way of life; the insolua-
ble core to all our efforts at home
and abroad. I

We then look abroad and see El
Salvador. Perhaps it is negligence to
focus on this war-torn country with-
out enumerating all the others that
are jaded with bloodshed‘ and injus-
tice, but El Salvador has no fear of
suffering from budget cuts taking
place right now. On the contrary,
they are on the advent of receiving
more American monies and wea-
pons, while human lifejin that coun-
try is valued on a par with the
proverbial plugged nickel.

At home, our attention was
recently turned to the execution of
Stephen _.ludy. His execution
becomes_central because: 1) capital
punishment is an “issue", and 2) exe-
cutions are ‘rare (Judyvwas only the
fourth person executed in the U.S.
since I967).

Factions for and against took
this new brutal episode in thejustice
system to voice their opinions. Yet,
the rarity of this punishment didn’t
stop it from occuring. Stephen Judy
was murdered by. the same people
who told him murder was wrong. '

All this does is confuse; if we are
to view it. as the left hand being
unaware of what the right hand is
doing, then the turmoil can be seen
as a nation wildly waving its arms.‘

That cloud of ambiguity seems no
less threatening than when we
began. In fact, our current state has
left us more shadowed. Maybe if we
could rectify ’ something ‘such as
f‘value” we could be more consistent
in our assessment of it.

A successful season came to a dis-
appointing close Saturday night for
the Pitt Pantherette basketball
team. The Rutgers Lady Knights
knocked Pitt out of the Mid-
Atlantic Regional Basketball Cham-
pionships, defeating the Panther-
ettes 91-80. First-year coach Judy
Saurer and her Pitt squad ended the
season with a 20-7 record.

Rutgers dented the scoreboard
first with two Patty Coyle free
throws to jump to a 2-0 lead‘. Gail '
Aughburns hit a short baseline

V‘ jumper- and Penny Welsh banked

one in, giving Pitt its only lead ofthe
first half, 4-3, just 1:36 into the
game.

All-American Kris Kitchener of
Rutgers evened t-he score with a free
throw, and ‘then a rash -of Pan-
therette turnovers allowed the Lady
Knights to put in three unanswered
buckets, giving __Rutgers a 10-4 edge.

With the graduation of Sam
Clancy", from the Pitt basketball
team following this season, a hole
will exist in the,Panther1ine-up that
must be filled to’ keep the recent'suc-

cess going. Replacing a Sam Clancy ’

is nearly impossible but tapping
another front-line talent isthe key.

The Pantherettes suffered another
setback when Aughburns was
slapped with her third personal foul.
at the 14:29 mark of the half.

Down l8-l0 when Aughburns
exited the game, Pitt’s strategy
shifted slightly and the guards took
over. Lori Dolby swished one from
the outside and hit a short jumper
the next time down the court. Lori
Arent added a free throw, and at
11:35 Carol Dugan hit a longjumper
that sliced Rutgers‘ lead to one, 18-
17.

Rutgers then started to sink two
baskets to- Pitt’s _one. Kirchener and
Joanne Burke ~hit back-to-back
layups before Pitt’s Dolby ripped
the nets from l5'feet out. Kitchener.
then dropped twofree throws-, Coyle ‘
connected from 20 feet out, and
Dorner scored on a layup before
Dugan could answer for Pitt with a
layup of her own.

Rutgers continued to extend its
lead as Burke hit two driving layups,
increasing the margin to 13. Three
minutes later, Jennie Hall tipped in a

l98l recruiting season by signing
former area player, junior college
transfer, Roosevelt Kirby, a six-
foot, foot-seven forward.
presently playing at Connors State
Junior College in Warner,
Oklahoma. '

“l-Ie’ll be a big addition to our
basketball team," said Chipman.

some ofthe slack of Sam Clancy.” » I _ _ .  _

Kirby is"

stray shot that gave" Rutgers their
biggest lead of the night, 44-29.

The final 4:35 ofthe half belonged

to Pitt. Arent started offwith a short
jumper, Pam Miklasevich banked in
a turnaround jumper, and Arent
added one from the charity stripe
before Burke put in a jumper for
Rutgers.

Beth Tarasi connected on a long

jumper from the corner, Lynn Love

9 dropped in a basket, and Arent
swished a baselinejumper to cut the
Rutgers lead, to eight, 48-40 at
halftime. .

The Pantherettes shot an impres-

sive 5l.6_ percent from the ﬁeld clip
in" the first half, but the Lady
Knights were even more successful,
sinking 54.5 percent. From the foul
line, Pitt was 8 of ll while Rutgers
was l2 of 14.

Dolby started the second half with

a short jumper. However, Rutgers
built nine-point leads twice in the
opening two min.utes. Pitt’s offense
came alive then. as Miklasevich

Super Sam, Slam Bam, Sam low-
ering the Boom. Every description
of Sam Clancy has power associated
with it, explosive power. More than
a scorer, San Clancy is power per-
sonified. His huge thighs are the
springboards for his tremendous
leaping ability.

Over his four years, there have
been performances to illustrate
Clancy’s physical power. Seventeen
rebounds against Duke, including a
last second rebound and layup in a

-.win over Duke, victories over Syra-
cuse and Maryland and this year’s 27
point total against Penn State.

The man that has been Pitt Bas-
ketball for four years received some
well deserved credit when he was
named AP All-America Honorable
Mention. Clancy’s ebullience was
hard to disguise upon receiving the
news of the honor.

“Its a thrill to be considered one
of the top players in the country. I
was surprised to hear that l had been
named,” Clancy said.

For Clancy, it was the culmina-
tion of a great season and a great
career. His statistics have not been

When you're the coach of a colle-
giate basketball team named the
ldaho Vandals, laboring in obscur-
ity in the -far reaches of the North-
western United States in a town
called Moscow, you have to have a
sense’ of humor‘.

When your team has a 25-3
record, youcan afford to.

ldaho basketball ~ coach _ Don
Monson is in the same predicament

the Pitt coaches were in after the S

unexpected announcement Sunday
that his team would meet Pitt in the
opening round of the NCAA Far
West Regionals in~_El Paso, Texas

_ this Friday.

ssclearl out here in the West, the

Quuaucs 0 1y come in every three

weeks. I don’t know much about Pitt
other than what l’ve heard,“ joked
Monson, over a telephone hook-up
at yesterday's Eastern 8 post-season
press conference.

“We don’t have any film of them,
but I know they have some great
athletes and theylre playing their
best at the right time,” Monson said.

The same can be said ‘of ldaho.
The Vandals enter the NCAA tour-
unknown. despite their stand out
record, ldaho has won 14 of its last
16 games, including the Big Sky

ffonference title last weekend by

defeating preseason‘ favorite Mon-
tana, _70-64. ldaho’s 25. victories

Sam Clancy’s value is not merely
statistical.

As Pitt basketball coach Roy
Chipman put it, Clancy’s impor-
tance is much deeper.

“People kid about the'physical
kind of leadership that Sam provi-
des,because of his size and strength,
but Sam also picked up the team and

led them__mentally and emotionally’
too.” '

lndeed, it wasn’t until Clancy
decided to take the leadership of the
team that the Panthers began the
road that led to the NCAA
tournament.

And little wond'er. At 6'6, 240
pounds, Clancy can be a very good
leader. lf Clancy told you to hustle,
you hustle. Only a fool would argue
with Clancy.

for his destructive force under the

there is much more.

Clancy has begun to show that his
outside shooting touch, which all the
experts deemed non-existent, has
begun to develop. His defense,

ing only, is intimidating.

  Pep Talk  

By Am/‘n Ghossein

The following is an overview of each of the Four NCAA
Regionals and who I think the final four teams will be to
batte for the collegiate basketball title in Philadelphia.

EASTERN REGIONAL: A strong regional is not the
strongest, with Virginia, Notre Dame, and UCLA as the top
three teams. Notre Dame, in my opinion, is the strongest
team overall. Virginia has Ralph Samson but lacks the all
round depth or talent of the Irish. The problem is that the
Irish will probably have to face UCLA and Virginia or
Tennessee before making it to the final tour.

I look for Tennesses or Virginia to win this regional. Notre
Dame has the horses but the road to Philadelphia is very
tough for them. The darkhorse in this regional is James
Madison, who nearly beat Virginia earlier in the year.

MIDEAST REGIONAL: A good field with DePaul Blue
Demons and Kentucky heading the list. Several teams can
win this bracket. The Blue Demons have the best talent and
judging by Sunday’s whipping ofNotre Dame, DePaul is the
odds-on favorite to win it. If the Blue Demons get by Wake
Forest, a tough upset-primed ACC team, then they have a
good chance to go all the way. But watch out for Bobby
Knight’s Indiana bunch, who have the homecourt in Bloo-
mington, Indiana, and a line coach on the bench in Knight.
Joe Hall’s Kentucky wildcats may just be a year away, with
their abundance of young talent, from taking the NCAA
crown. But not this year. I

My underdog in this regional are the Maryland Terrapins.
Although they have some of the best talent in the country,
the only thing hampering them is their coach Lefty Driesel, a

great recruiter but a mediocre bench coach. If the Terrapins

get the ball to Albert King often, and to Ernest Graham,
their two best offensive weapons, then maybe talent could
pull it off for Maryland. I

MIDWEST REGIONAL: A weaker regional than the
previous two. Louisiana State and Arizona-Sundevils are the
top two teams. LSU is loaded, maybe the most talented team
in the nation. Their only problem is that they getda little out

of control and forget to give the ball to Rudy Macklin and

Howard Carter. LSU, if it plays up to capabilities, could

’ waltz right through this regional. If they falter, the surging

Louisville Cardinals (last year's champs) or the ASU Sun-
devils could be there to pick up the slack.

Louisville, after an abysmal I-7 start, has rounded back
into a championship team. They do not however have that
one outstanding player who can do it all, a la Darrell Grif-
fith, who was lost to graduation.

The underdog in this regional is Lamar. Lamar has a
player who, if he gets hot, could carry them farther than
some people expected. Guard Mike Oliver is his name and
putting it up is his game. Oliver couldvvery well take Lamar
places.

WESTERN REGIONAL: Before I analize this regional,I
have to pick my sentimental underdog Pitt. This might be

folly, but Pitt is my underdog simply because no one
expected them to ‘go this far and they are playing their best of
the year.  ,

Oregon State and North Carolina are one—two in this
regional, but watch out for Illinois. They have some very
oood Euards and might surprise some teams. Oregon State is
a very good team b_ut I think they’re one dimensional with
center Steve Johnson carrying the load. What happens if he
gets into foul trouble‘?

North Carolina has a superb front line with All.-America
Al Wood, James Worthy and Sam Perkins, but their guards

might be suspect. Oregon State has to be the favorite with a;
gaudy_26-l record but I just can’t see them winning the“ -

regional. '

My Final Four is Tennessee, DePaul, LSU, and Illinois.
The Final will be LSU and DePaul with Willie Sims of LSU
as my’ tourney MVP.That’s right, LSU is my choice for the
championship. I ’

Thanks to teamwork, the Pitt
Hockey team defeated Carnegie
Mellon University _6-3 on Saturday.

Coming off two disappointing
losses to Navy in Annapolis just a
few weeks earlier, the Panthers came
out ready to turn the tables.

patterned offense at Idaho and 2-3
matchup zone defense similar to the
one that Michigan State uses. As a
result, the Vandals are averaging an
impressive 55.l percent from the
field while holding their opposition
to ‘a 43.3 field goal percentage. Four
of the top five Idaho starters are
averaging jn double figures this
season.

“We rely on quickness and consis-
tency on offense and defense,” said
Monson. “We play primarily a
match-up zone most of the time, but
we do also switch defenses and play
some man-to—man.”

The key to Friday night’s game is
expected to be how well Pitt guards
Carlton Neverson and Dwayne Wal-
lace can hold Idaho’s quick back-
court duo of Brian Kellerman and

PAT

Ken Owens in check.

Sophomore Kellerman leads
Idaho in scoring with a l6.4 average.
The 6-foot-5 shooting guard is aver-
aging 52.7 in field goal accuracy
from the floor and 80 percent from
the free throw line.

Kellerman is followed by 6-foot
point guard Ken Owens, the Most
Valuable Player in the'Big Sky tour-
nament, who is averaging 13.5

points a game. Owens led the team in ~ " 

the regular season with I77 assists.
As a team, Idaho averages over l3
assists a contest. -.
Rounding out the starting five are

Pitt should matchup well in height
against the Vandals’ front line,
whose tallest starting player stands
6-foot-7.

“We're relatively short as far as_

post-season competitors go in colle-
giate basketball,” Monson said. “We
have had some problems in the past,
getting out-rebounded. But part of it
is attributable to the new defense we

play."

Even though Idaho suffers from a
recognition problem in the colle-
giate basketball world, playing in an
obscure conference, Monson was
good-natured about the lack of fan-
fare surrounding his team. So far, he
added, only I00 tickets have been
sold at Idaho for the NCAA game.

forechecking held the puck in the
CMU zone for approximately the
first four minutes.

Pitt popped in four goals while
shutting out CMU in the second
period. After the flurry in‘ the
second, Pitt continued skating well
as they held CMU scoreless for the
remaining of the contest. _

Outstanding plays by Brian Mor-
gan, Dave Forry and Fred Erny con-
tributed to Pitt’s victory.

With 2:34 remaining in the third
period a bench brawl occurred. The
referees called the game, saying it (‘
was too late for CMU to comeback
and tie the ‘score.

After the contest, many ofthe Pitt
players said they thought the game
was well played and that the team
was able to put it all together on
both sides ,of the rink.‘

Fred Erny summed up the team’s
feelings, as he said the contest was
“an all-out team effort."

Due to a typographical error in the article entitled “Confidence Key to
Victory For First-Year Coach Chipman" by Johnette Howard in the Mon-
dav,‘ March 9 issue of The Pitt News, the paragraph should have read:
...Despite the gaudy 226-83 record he compiled over 13 years of coaching in
the collegiate ranks, including 60 wins in his last three seasons, it was said
Chipman had beefed up the mark on lesser opponents in a borderline
Division I school, Lafayette, and two other Division II schools.

also an Eastern Division ll record.

The two mile relay team did not
suffer from the lossiof Pam Gearing.
Pentathlete Kathe Dvorsak stepped
in and did a finejob, as the quartet
finished in third place with a time of
9251. Running with Dvorsak- and
Murray were junior" Sally Higgins
and freshmanvValerie Strasser.

“There ‘really was no problem
with Kathe taking over from" Pam,”
explained Pitt coach Alfreeda-Goff.
“Kathe runs the half mile as part of
the pentathlon, so she was ready for

“l wasextremely pleased with our
performance this weekend,” stressed

‘Goff. “I never expected to finish
sixth in the team standings when l

was ta-king only five athletes. That
just shows how much ' they’ve
improved, and what we have to look
forward to outdoors.”

Murray will be preparing for the
National Indoor Track Champion-
ships to be held at Idaho State Col-
lege this weekend while the rest of
the Pantherettes move into training
for the outdoor season. The speeds-
ter from Butler will be competing in
only the 400 meter dash, although
she also qualified in the 300 meter
event. ‘ I '-

“Thc races‘“are going to be run
back tojback, so we chose to enter
the one we feel Gwen will do best in,”
said Goff. I , — '
