Furman “Apparently”
Squeaks By Bowl Team
With Last Second Win

Robert Earle called it the
“most exciting game in the
history of the 1 College
Bowl,” but that appears to be
the only consolation to the Uni-
versity team, which apparently
lost to Furrman, 295285, at the
ﬁnal buzzer.

“Apparently” is the correct
word, since there is some ques-
tion over an apparent confer-
ence by ‘the Furnam team that
was not called. For this reason
the University has asked the of-
ﬁcials in charge for a ru.l.ing,but
there is little chance of the de-
cision being changed.

The team led 285-275 when
Eurman answered J -am-estown to
a.20 point bonus question as the
ﬁnal whistle sounded. Earle did-
n’t hear the answer, but they
repeated it and were ruled the
winners as the studio audience
went wild (135 supporters from
Furman ﬂew up for the game,
and constituted about 90 per
cent of the audience).

The University quartet got off
to another of its patented slow
starts, then, led by captain
George Gray, narrowed the def-
ecit to 115-85 at the half.

The second half was nip and
tuck, with the lead c-on.sta.ntly
changing hands, ‘«l\/lliike Bro-urrman
came up with three answers for
Pitt, Death in Venice, Hawaii,

and Thomas Malthus, while
Gray got Moliere and Tom
Graves answered correctly, a
question about osmosis.

Brourman and Graves colla-
borated to answer bonus ques-
tions on German Romanticism
and famous pianists Franz Liszt,
Rachmaninoff, and Chopin to
keep the University in the lead
until that ﬁnal question.

The apparent conference came
when two Furman team mem-
bers conferred during the play-
ing of a waltz by Shostakovich,
but the judge apparently missed
it. However, if it appears on the

tape,

then there is a s mall

chance that the score might be
changed, especially since the live
showing of the program was
preempted by a golf tournament.

The 580 points scored by both
teams is the highest total in the
history of the show, and 285
points is the most ever scored
by a losing team. In their three

appearances,

the University

team won t-otall scholarship
awards of $7,000.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT President Ken Schueler gives address at banquet.

  Schueler Talks on Confidence 

 

At Annual S.G. Banquet

Horwitz comes to the Un:iver-
sity after a long career in fed-
eral service. He served as act-
ing chi-ef counsel for the trial of
major Japanese War Criminals
and counsel for the Special Sen-
ate Committee that conducted
the televised hearings on the
US Army and former Sen. Jo-
seph Mccarthy in 1954.

In the 1950's Horwitz served
as counsel to Sen. Stuart Sy-
mington and to President Lyn-
don Johnson during his years as
Senate Majority Leader.

As director of Organizational
Planning for the Defense De-
partment at the start of the
Kennedy administration, Hor-
witz was responsible for draw-
ing up the blueprints for the re-
organization of the Pentagon.
He later served as assistant to
the Secretary of Defense for Na-
tional Communications Systems.
President Johnson appointed
Horwitz Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Administration in
1964.

Commenting on the appoint-
ment, Chancellor Posvar said,
“We are honored that Horwitz
has consented to join our fac-
ulty. I am sure his presence at
the University will enrich all
our academic programs relating
to public affairs and will pro-
vide additional stimulus in a
number of areas.”

A native Pittsburgher, Hor-
witz received his BA and MA
degree from the University in
1930 and 1932, respectively, and

the LLB from Harvard,

Auxiliary Enterprises have" all
too often refused to hear stu-
dent ideas at V|alI“l0l.lLS levels of
the decision making process”
“But what should be acknow-
ledged by both students, faculty
and administration is that: as
adults, each of us maintains a
dignity and self-respect only in-

sofar as he feels he is shaping

and developing his environment,"
Schueler emphasized.

He believes that the primary
goal of SG is the restoration of
confidence, dignity and pride in
the University. “It is only when
each student can feel that his
needs and thoughts are articu-
lated and acted upon, that he
will regain his self-respect, and
once again become involved in
student .activrirtie-s,” said Schuel-
er. -
Schueler emphasized that “SG
shall express student opiniron,
provide a clearchanmel of com-
m-unIi.cati—orn amon.g students, ﬂac-
ulty, adm-inaistnastion, and alum-
nri . . . and provide the structure
for student authority in areas of
student affairs.

“SG can strive to meet these
goals but only with your help;
it will take more than two men,
more than 25 senators; it will
take concerned and aware stu-
dents guided and directed by
students who will generate a set
of leadership standards,” said
Schueler.

Outgoing SG President Ken
Frederick prefaced Schueleris re-
marks by offering a number of
constructive suggestions to the
new Senate. He suggested that
the new Senate “decide in its
own mind what the role of SG
is.
Frederick warned the new
Senearte not to neglect “the level
of sincere academic and social
questioning. The time has come
for SG to discuss and adopt a
platform of student rights."

SDS Offers Counseling Aida
To Students Escaping Mold

E NE\V YORK (CPS) es Stu-

(SDS) has set up a drop—out

SDS’s New York office is com-
piling a list of activities for po-
tential dropouts. The organizers
of the program, Michele Clark
and Jonathan Lerner, say the

_ activities include organizing proj-

ectis and working on under-
ground newspapers. These are
all “non-establishment” and are
intended to permit “those dis-
satisﬁed with the system repre-

and others in a dynamic and

much as SDS and other organ—

of these counselors will be to
help draft-eligible men who lose
their deferments by dropping
out.

In a statement about the proj-
ect, SDS said it was being set
up because “we want. to erase
the word ‘failure’ from the con-

maybe it's because you're an

individual.

There’s certain campus talk that claims
individuality is dead in the business world.
That big business is a big brother destroy-
ing initiative.

But freedom of thought and action, when
backed with reason and conviction’s cour-
age, will keep and nurture individuality
whatever the scene: in the arts, the sciences,
and in business.

Scoffers to the contrary, the red corpus-
cles of individuality pay oft’. No mistake.

Encouraging individuality rather than
suppressing it is policy in a business like

rucial   Challenge

During this past Student Government (SG) campaign, the cause
to abolish SG gained a legitimacy, not only because it was the major
purpose for Armand Belly’s candidacy, but because the other two
presidential candidates joined Belly in criticizing SG as it now stands.
Even though Belly was not successful, his arguments during the course
of the campaign convinced many students that his case was a valid
one. Students are now eyeing SG warily, seemingly awaiting a major
faux pas on the part of newly elected President Ken Schueler. A sur-

I prising tone of optimism has now been introduced to SG, however, as

those students who witnessed the stirring speech delivered by Schucler
at the annual SG_ Installation Banquet last Thursday evening can attest.

Why ‘was Schueler’s speech so outstanding? Its real significance
lies in his ability for going beyond the routine platitudes usually de-
lievered on these occasions. He didn’t deal in generalities; rather, he

‘ pointed to specific areas within this University that must be concen-

trated upon to rectify the current inequities. He pointed out that the
administration"‘has failed at times by refusing to face and deal with
students and their problems. The offices of Finance’, Business Affairs,
and Auxiliary Enterprises have all too often refused to hear student
ideas at various levels of the decision-making process.”

Schueler was not one-sided in his criticism. He also described how
students have “lost the respect of the faculty and administration be-
cause they have not had the courage to speak out on many important
issues.” Therein lies the soundness of his logic. For unlike all too many
student critics, Schueler didn’t make the mistake of focusing his diag-
nosis on one particular group. He recognized, and rightly so, that one

cannot castigate the student _leaders for failure without attempting to
define the “whys” of those “failures.” In defining the failures, Schueler
saw that students were often stymied in their attempts to effect changes
in key areas of student concern; he saw that students are confronted
with tremendous odds when trying to alter a system, even if this alter-
ation is a ten per cent student discount in the Book Center that already
grants such discounts to all University faculty and staff members.

Our new President’s perception shows that he has been able to
diagnose why the “failures” of the past occurred. He has now taken
that f'irst step on his road to disproving that SG should -be abolished;
he has seen beyond the surface analysis of why SG has not succeeded.
In order to totally disprove the contention that SG serves no worth-
while purpose, Schueler must now translate the lessons he has learned
from the past into a workable alternative to the current methods for
dealing with student problems. He must now seek the elusive solutions
to resolving what have now become perennial student concerns, such
as a new Student Union and achieving a “student’s” book center.

While challenging the senators and the student body to join him
in his drives to achieve his goals, Schueler has posed the greatest chal-
lenge to himself. For in the end the ultimate success of his administra-
tion and perhaps the entire concept of SG at our University will rest
in his interpretation of his role; he must serve as a catalyst to achieve
the results he so fervently wants. Although he has made significant
strides towards diagnosing the problems facing past administrations,
he must recognize that the most difficult task for him is still before
him—he must now find the cure.

Letters To   The Editor

Soph Compares
Library to Zoo

Edtictor, The Pitt News:

Last Friday afternoon I visit-
ed the Highland Park Zoo. I
.-left the Zoo thinking I had seen
an i.ncom.parable assortment of
animals. My asasu-mption was

4 later proved wrong: there was

a better show on the second
ﬂoor of the Hillman Library on
Monday night.

The ﬁrst creature stretched
-out in his chair and put his two
bare feet prominently on the
table in front of him. Occasion-
ally he s-cratched his head
through his cranberry sailor cap
and wigigled his toes agreeably.
If it weren't for his incessant
chialtterinzvg, I could have believed
that he was studying, for a book
rested in his paw. He was a de-
lightful crealture; too bad I did-
n’t have a banana with me, for
he deserved a reward for his.
performance.

Amother favlorite nested in one
of the soundproof study rooms.
Slou-ehing oomplazcently in his
chair, he pressed his ﬁlthy, bare
feet against the glass windows
which faced the center of the li-

brary. Occasionally he nodded
approval -to his friends who fro-
licked behind him in the den.
Later he treated the crowd to a
little performance. On the black-
board ins-ide of the room, he
drew a heart with an arrow
through it and decorated it with
the name of his mate and his
f-raternity’s letters. I decided
that I was lucky that this one
didn’t hibernate this winter.
What an act!

The last two individuals were
snugged cozily on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
of the library (which was closed
to the public, incidentally). Any-
one who walked along the cen-
ter balcony of the second ﬂoor
could glance down into their
private cave and watch their
show.‘ (It was recommended for
mature audiences.) This couple
should have charged admission
to all observers, for their act
was a tough act to follow.

If you missed the show at the
library thus far, don’t despair.
It occurs nightly, with varia-
tions, of co-urse, and admission
is free. Aﬂter watching one of
these exhibitions, perhaps you
would like to join with me in
making this suggestion. Maybe
the University should remove

Girls Plea
For Quiet

Editor, The Pitt News:

We never knew libraries could
be such fun; just imagine all of
‘the beautiful carpet space of
Hillman awlaiting acrobatic en-
thusiassts, exercise ﬁends, and
starry-e-yed young lovers.

Somehow, we have been labor-
ing under the misconception that
libraries were places for quiet
study and research. Finally, how-
ever, we have been set on the
right path by the many exam-
ples proving that H-illmvan was
destined for frat get-togethers, a
comfortable conversation place,
and as an annex to the Student
Union.

Now, please help us ﬁnd a
quiet place to study!

Students Read
Dirty Books

Editor, The Pitt News:

The University library is to
be credited with a -really re-
markable feartz despite the thick
layers. of dust and ﬁlth that
coated so many of its volumes
when they were in the (lathe-
drail of Learning, the books
have been transferred to the
new Hillman Library with al-
most all the dust intact. One
would think that in the pack.
ing, moving and reshelving of
books, much of the dirt would
accidentlly have been knocked
off, but never fear!

In the old Open—Stack' library
in the Oathedraal basement it
was common for browsers to

  

ﬁnd books so wthickly buried in
dust that the ﬁlth had to be
wiped away to read their titles;
anyone who did ‘too much brows-

Since a University is a place

Stratford Warns
Of Monster

Editor, The Pitt News:

Stratford pseudo-seientisnts on
a recent pleasure cruise down
the Monongahela River discov-
ered a mature specimen of a
once-thought-to—be-extinct c r ea -
ture. After counsulting with
Horse Czarnecki, the men of
Stratford conﬁrmed that their
stupendous ﬁnd was not a miss-
placed Field Ho-use gimmick or
-the work of college pranksters.

After having made uneducated
guesses and doing unscholarly
research in ancient issues of
Marvel Comics, the Stnatford

team «revealed the little-known
legend of the Hutchkonian
Rhinosaurus.

Eons of time have passed
since this weird species inhab-
ited the eart.h. At one time this
unghastly creature roamed and
ravaged at will. It seems that
this horrid monster was attract-
e‘ ‘“t6“”EH‘é” Fidsﬁlfxgwareatiasca
mating ground. Sad as a broken
romance may be, the love story

of the rhinosaurus is even more"

heart-rending.

Alas and alack, the ugly crea-
ture could not ﬁnd a living,
breathing, warm body to mate
with. Faced with the dismal
prospect of bedding alone dur-
ing its one wee-k rutting seals-on,
the pitaiable creaiture burrowed
into the mud to hibernate for 5,-
000 years until his next rutting
season. Beware, that season is
near (Feb. 12-17).

Sympathetic humanituari ans
that they are, and also for fear

of incurring the sadistic wrath I
of the monster, the men -o-f Strat-

ford hastily agreed to bring the
Hutchkonian Rhinosaurus to the
Pitt campus in search of a mate.
It makes strong men weak.
weak men cry for “mother.”
Girls beware. At the present
time the ugly thing is safely en-
caged in a chamber on the
fourth floor of Tower A. If, I
repeat, if the Hutchkonian Rhino-
sauru-s should escape, the only
way to be safe is to put your
pennies in the box underneath
his picture on the UMOC board
during the week of Feb. 12-17.

~ were playing.

No one seemed quite sure
4 where he was supnpsos-ed to be
in the zone and, as a result, the
"cagers we-re often caught out of
position and that left F-ordham
_ players -free underneath the
-. hoop for layu'.ps.

Actually, the Panthers started
out playing rather well, jump-
ing off to a 15-7 lead before they
ran into a dry spell that lasted
-the rest of the game. Fordham
caught up quickly, moving to a

30-18 advantage, then pulled
_ away steadily in the second half
. ‘after the cagers had narrowed
— the gap to 38-30 at intermission.

The only tension in the clo-s-
ing minu-tes of the game was
over whether the Rams would
_ ‘hit their 20 point betting spread.
 When it became obvious that
.-they would, the gambllers in the
crowd began making more risky
wagers, namely whether the
-Pant-hens would make their free
rth-rowls.

This was the only part of the
cagers’ game in which they re-
lsembled Wilt C.hta.mberlain. At
the foul line t-hey hit 15 of 30

A for a horrendous 50 per cent,

. causing some of the betto-rs in
-the crowd to lay 6-5 that the
‘Panthers would miss their next
charity toss.

_About the only bright spot for

‘coach Bob Timmons was the
return to form by guard Bob
_ Petrini. Petrini saw quite 3. bit
of action because Pete Smith
was slowed down with an eye
injury, and the sophomore re-
sponded with a pair of beauti-
ful drives, and a total of 10

points.

High scorer for the Panthers
was the other guard, Tony) De-
 Dilsio, who also turned in a cou-
ple of ﬁne drivin-g‘ b-uckets and
ﬁnvi-shed with 18 points, high for
both sides. Bob Kellert, a 6'4”
_ sophomore led the Rams with
 _16‘_points, mostly layups.
That was the trouble for the
Panthers. The Fordham 'lIa.yups
‘ ‘L were plentiful while the cagers’
were too few. The situation does-
’/'1n’t look much more promising

‘ Cagers Hope to Rebound
 AgainstKentStateAfter
88-63 Loss to F ordham

by MIKE BOURMAN

-  Assistant Sports Editor

_ BRONX (N. Y.)——The ﬁrst thing a basketball player is
taught when he i's up against a zone defense is to throw
the ball around the zone, don’t try to pass through it.
Fordham broke this cardinal rule repeatedly against the
‘Panthers here Saturday, and, instead of getting stung,

they ended up with a 88-63 victory.

When the Rams passed over the cager’s zone, they usually ended
- up with easy buckets, rather than having the ball intercepted. The
main reason appeared to be Panthers’ confusion over the defense they

because of recurring leg trouble.
“S.h:idelmanrtle strained a thigh
muscle in practice,” said coach
Warren Neiger. “He could have
won the event if he had gone in,
but Te-mprle has four 9.0 per-
formers in vaulting and he
would have had to make a great-
er effort. We didn’t want to ag-

however, picked up a 7.9 on ﬂoor

Maryland Sinks Mermen, 73-40

by ART ROSENGARTEN

A little yellow troll sat defiantly on the
edge of the one meter diving board, seem-
ingly daring anyone to stop the Maryland
swimming team from gaining its tenth win. As it
turned out the spirited Terps didn’t need the extra
luck as they outclassed the swimmers, 73-40, Sat-
urday at Trees Pool. ‘

Before a crowd of about 150 fans, the swimmers
strove to keep the score respectable. “There is
nothing you can do about it,” said a tired looking
coach Bill Grant. “They are a bunch of real tough
swimmers and a win against them is real hard to
come by. With three records set against you in
your own pool, it's hard to find something to be
glad about.”

Two of these records were set by one man,
David Heim. A long distance freestyler, Heim set
a new Trees’ mark in the 1000-yard freestyle of
10:58.2 (bettering John Lane’s record of 11:09.8)
and knocked 2.5 seconds off the old 500-yard free-
style record.

“I could have gone faster, but I’m in little out
of condition after our semester break,” said the
muscular Heim. “Breaking the 500 record gave me
a great pleasure, because it was held by a rival of
mine, Ed Rerych of N. C. State.” Heim, who fin-
ished 12th in last year's NCAA 500, hopes to crack

into the top five in this year's race, and improve
his chances for a trip to Mexico City for the Olym-
pics.

The other record setter was freestyle sprinter
Wayne Pawlowski. Pawlowski set his in the 100-yd.
freestyle, breaking the old mark set by former
Maryland star Phil Denkowitz by one-tenth of a
second in a time of 248.4.

The swimmers captured only two first places,
and these came at the outset of the meet. The 400-
yard medley team of Richard Norris, Chris Price,
Howard Norris and anchorman John Lane, just
nipped the Terps’ quartet by two-tenths of a sec-
ond.

In the next event, diver Dean Coleman cap-
tured the one meter diving by .55 of a point. Cole-

man gained his victory on his sixth and final dive. ‘

Out of a possible ten points from each of the three
judges, Coleman received marks of 71/2, 7, and
61/2 and coupled with a degree of difficulty of 2.2
gave him his slim margin of victory.

“This was by far Dean’s best performance on
the low board,” said Grant. “He really pressed for
the win and gave his all.”

Grant once again pointed to the lack of depth
as a factor in his team’s performance. “Maryland
was superior to us, but when the boys have to
swim that third event, their chances become even
slimmer for a second place finish and a close
meet,” he said.

“We have improved some, al-
though they’re not quite as
strong as last year,” commented
coach Dave Adams about his
squad in relation to Michigan.
“Still, Michigan is 7-2. They're
certainly not pu-shovers. Their

only loss came to Oklahoma.”-

Oklahoma is a perennial wrest-

     
  

might’ve knocked them off.”
Per usual, the grapple-rs swept
through the early weights, tak-
ing three of four matches. It
was the one they lost, 137, that
Adams was also counting on.
“If Larry Cuba (137) and Jim
Rhone (152) had won,” offered
Adams, “we could have won the
meet.” Both lost decisions. Both
Rhone and Tim Trax (160) lost
their bouts in the third period.

. For Temple, Jay Geist, Fred
Turoff, Barry Weiner, and Pete
DiFurio paced the Owls to a
sweep of the seven evenuts. Di-
Furio had the top performance
of the meet with a 9.35 on the
parallel bars, and Geist grabbed
ﬁrsts with an 8.35 on the tram-
poline and a 9.05 on the horizon-
tal bars.

Fred Turoff, one of Temple's
Olympic prospects, won the still
ring event with a 9.2 and scored
a total of 52.45 points. Weiner
took wins on the longhorse and
floor exercise with scores of 9.2.

Watching a team like Temple
perform often inspires a gym-
nast to change his routine. “You
watch those guys go so smooth-
ly through «their routines and
often they execute perfectly a
move you might have been hav-
ing trouble with in practice,”
commented gymnast Dave An-
drew. “I picked up several good

2 moves on floor exercise by
watching good opponents. Watch- " 

someone else in a meet often
inspires you to work the hard-
er move into your routine and
do it well."

Geist apparenrtly provided such
inspira-tion o-n the parallel bars.
As the ﬁrst man up in that
event, he-executed beautifullly a
piroutte (turn around on the
bars while doing a handstand).
Phil Lilly of Pitt followed him
by venturing a handstand, and
Shidemantlle copied Geist suc-
cessfully. But several h<es.itat=ions
held Shidcmantle to a 6.0.

(6-1 at 130) the meet reﬂected
typical performances. Ron Selm-
chert bounced back for a win
at 145.

“Ron did a nice job,” said
Adams. “I-Ie’s starting to get
back into shape. It was the best
he’s looked. Unangst almost pin-

Tuesday and Thursday were
the ﬁnal days of the regular
dorm basketball season, but the
teams didn't seem to know it.
Of the six games scheduled only
two were played. The other four
resulted in forfeits.

Pleasure Palace topped off
fchei-r undefeated, ﬁrst place ﬁn-
ish by romping over Random
House, 70-18, in theqnly “A”
tilt played.

Warren Allen paced the Pal-
ace with a 16-point effort. Cliff
Brown collected ten points and
Frank Hartz tossed in nine more
in the Palace triumph. ‘

Stratford House (4-1) grabbed
the second spot in the ﬁnal “A”
standings after taking a forfeit
decision from Keystone House
(2-3), holder of a fourth place,
and Hawthorne House (0-5),
alone at the bottom, gave the
" Playboys’ Penthouse (3-2) a

third place ﬁnish via forfeit on
the ﬁnal night of the ca.mpa.ig'n.

Panther House (5-0) won the
“B” title and will play the Pal-
ace tomorrow night for the d-orrn
championship. Their 65-40 win
over the House of Lords (1-4)
last week was the only “B”
game played.

Bob Cepanec tallied 29 points
t-o lead Panther to its ﬁfth win
in ﬁve games, while the losers’
top gun was Tom Czarto-ryski
who scored 15 points.

The "B" forfeits were won by

mental block. It was as if they
raised the bar a foot instead of
two inches.”

Salter set the previous record
of 6’8” in the ﬁrst frosh meet
and ‘earned an invitation to the
Classic. After the ﬁrst meet,
however, he had his share of
trouble with the facilities in the
Field House, which caused him
to alter his steps almost every
day. ‘

The short approach in the
Field House doesn’t allow Salter
to build up the speed he feels
he needs. “I was glad to ﬁnd out
I was just having trouble in the
Field House, and not with my
jumping,” said Salter, who has
yet to clear 65” there.

“Bryant is a big a:thlete,”s-aid
coach Jim Banner, “and he needs
plenty of room to run before
he jumps.” Banner was very
pleased with his frost-h star’s
showing in his ﬁrsrt Invitational
meet.

 

Banner noted that Salter seem-
ed nervous at ﬁrst, but gained
poise with each jump. Salter
agreed that the crowd and big
names affected him at ﬁrst, but
once he realized he was in com-
petition, he relaxed and did his
best ever.

One of t-he psychological blocks
that Salter had to shake off
came as the jumpers were at
the 6’8” height. The public ad-
