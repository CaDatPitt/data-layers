Victory in his ﬁrst Pittsburgh undertaking.

although Dawson has expressed a
desire for more depth.
Rice To Play? ..

The red—haired Minnesotan nat-
urally discounts reports that Iowa
is weak and inexperienced and
that George “Dusty” Rice, key
man of Evashevski’s backﬁeld,
will see limited action due to a
bad knee. “Injured” players have
been known to turn up Saturday
afternoon_.and run wild on occa-
sion.

Besides the highly—touted Rice
at left half, the 'Midwesterners’
backfield shows Bobby Stearnes at
right half, one of the shortest
backs in Iowa history, who excels
in‘ a left—handed running pass.

And Burt Britzmann, the quar-
terback, holds his team’s season
record for most pass completions
at 68, clicking for eleven touch-
downs last year. Fullback “Binky”
Broeder is a converted half.

Line Thin

Reports from within Iowa term
the material at guards and center
so thin as to‘ be “emaciated,” and
Evashevski, like Dawson, plans
on using some of his forwards on
both offense and defense.

The heavy man on the line,
which averages 199 pounds to 206
for the Jungle Cats, is tackle Don

City Council, that suppose_dly
solemn body of men chosen to
judiciously govern the affairs of
this city, has succeeded in anger-
ing a large number of Pitt stu-
dents who favor buyingtwo live
panthers as mascots ’

Rather than
giving a de-
cision based
on a - c 1 o s e
study at the

_facts, council
has treated the
matter as\if it
were a. comic

effect, insulted '

serious about . ‘Sutton

money in the cause. And council

Tomorrow is the big day. Pitt

The hot dog consumption un-
doubtedly will show a sharp rise,
a fact that should rejoice the sta-
dium doctors of'Weinerology.

The band will do its _usual ﬁna
job. Depending upon the nature
of the game, the student section
will erupt into huge ‘roars or re-
lapse into periods of woeful si_—
lence. ‘
Fickle Spirit ~.

When‘ things are going well for
Pitt, the display of roaring en-
thusiasm from the student sec-
tion is, to a local booster, an in-
spiring thing, for it seems to
communicate simply the school’s
backing of their team.

When Pitt is losing, ‘however,
and the chances of victory seem
dim, the noise that the cheer-
leaders stir hardly carries past
the ﬁrst few rows. If that much
abused term, school spirit, is best
expressed by the amount of
cheering at athletic events, then

it is indeed a very ﬁckle phe-
nomenon. ~ -

Just why ‘does game spirit’

vary so? Much_of the answer to

this may lie in the basic attitude

of many students that a football
, game is something like a show:

you clap for a good performance‘

and remain silentafter a bad
one. -

his money are not lightly parted.‘
It is entirely possible that

. bringing two wild animals into

a crowded football stadium is
not the wisest thing to do. But
there are animal experts who
could advise council about that.

Consult Experts

Transporting a panther back
and forth once a week might or
might not be_a good thing for the
animals. Experts could be con-
sulted on that. Experts, ‘as a mat-
ter of- fact, could have been con-
sulted on all phases of the prob-
lem. ‘ ' -

But'no such thing was done.
Instead, council members tried to
outdo each other in being funny,
one member suggesting pulling
the teeth of the cats, another sug-
gesting that_Labor would be op-
posed to the project because it
would put a student out of work.

In high school, unlike college,
most students experienced "a

while developing big time sports,

Only last week at a-high school

teen-aged girls on a cheering
squad became hysterical and
faintedvduring their first high

the game, ﬁve ambulances cross-

Even if theilong promised girl

if the student body could be,

Ties In;

By HAROLD LEVINE

Pitt now has anew custom.

The freshman men will ‘wear
blue and gold ties until they en-
gage the sophomores in a tug-
of-war. If the sophs win, the
freshmen willchave to wear their
ties for two weeks more. Other-
wise the ties

will come off

Next year ité

san cti ty 0

age and pre-

cedent upon. it 

so it will be;

_ elevated to the ‘

rank of a tra_— .
dition. A tra
dition at Pitt
is a n y t hing
w h i c h .w a s
done last year.

Three years ago the freshman
counselors, noting that the veter-
ans were thinning out, resurrect-
ed an authentic tradition by hav-
ing the ‘Pitt frosh wear vdinks-.
This did not go too well. Most of
the freshman wore their dinks in
the corners of their ‘clothes clos-
ets. Men’s council after trying
three years to enforcethe dink
rule has ﬁnally givenup.

Good Idea

The ties are a good idea. It is

Levine

now possible to identify a fresh-_

man in class if he is abiding by
the rules. Most of the freshmen
‘seem to be obeying them too.

These ties may reyolutionize.

the style of dress at Pitt. Alarge
segment of the male population
at the University avoids ties. Of
course the fraternity men always

.sport their striped neckware as

the badge of their position, but
the majority of men at Pitt are
non-frat.

The freshmen, who are mostly
‘just out of high school where ties
are considered useful for hanging
people, may continue to wear
them, thus reversing a 30 year
trend‘. ‘

Tug-of-War

Anyway the freshman ties are

 Army Trip  
  Tour of West Point

Offers  

By Irene Rozakis .
After all -the talk about Pittsburgh’s Point, it might
be surprising to ﬁnd out that there are other “po1nts” of

interest in this country.

onithe special bus to West Point
next month.

ROTC—watchers will g et a
chance to see some extra special
marching at the review which
takes place before the game.

Of the. numerous buildings at
-West Point, the gothic-styled Cadet

Chapel is one of the most famous.
Each year, _the graduating class
presents two stained glass windows
to the chapel——one in honor of its
own class and one in honor of the
class that graduated 100 years be-
fore ,
. ‘ The cemetery near the Old
Cadet Chapel dates from 1816 with
the oldest headstone carrying the
_ name of Ensign Trent who died in
 1782.

At Trophy Point, the history-

minded visitor will ﬁnd war relics
dating back to the Revolutionary
War. '
' The most unusual of these are
links from the Great Chain
stretched across the Hudson River
during the Revolution as a barrier
to enemy ships.’

Cullum I-Iall, now used for cadet
dances, contains both portraits and
busts of famous generals.

  

It will be a pleasant surprise, though, for passengers

A rather unusual building is the
Riding Hall. This structure was
formerly used for indoor horse-
manship instruction. '. .

Althoughcadet barracks are not

open to the public, visitors may
enter the cadet dining room, Wash-
ington Hall. ,

An attention—getter in this build-
ing is a wall mural which depicts
the Decisive Battlesof the World,
painted in 1934 by Tom Loftin
Johnson.

. Pitt students could certainly
sigh with envy over West Point’s
gymnasium. It contains three
swimming pools, handball, basket-
ball, and squash courts, and rooms
for boxing, fencing, wrestling, and
other activities. .

Also in this building is the Army
Theater which seats 3000.

West Point officials have made
it easy for visitors to enjoy them-
selves, The school maintains a Vis-
itors Information Center which in-
cludes. a restaurant, information"
desk,-"displays dealing with cadet
training, cadet model room, and a

Pitt Prof iMakes Time

.. . By John De Ninno .

On the Personality page of the July 21 issue of Time
magazine the beaming face of Dr.. Benjamin Spock, pro-
fessor of Child Development, smiles. at the reader. And to
the person meeting Dr. Spock for the ﬁrst time his face

appears just as pleasant.

Dr. Spock, who came to Pitt in
July of 1951 is a happy and con-
genial person who seems very
satisﬁed with his work, that of
child care.

Perhaps one of the reasons Dr.
Spock seemsso happy is that he
found a home with a large lawn
overrun with__ crab grass. To most
people this"would be cause for
dismay but not to Dr. Spock, who
loves large lawns and describes
himself as a “lawn ﬁghter.”

“A lawn ﬁghter,” he said,i"‘is
one who goes out and -battles
crab grass and dandelions.”

Born in New Haven, Connecti-
cut, Dr. Spock moved to New
York while still in medical school
because his ﬁance lived there
and he wanted to get married.
To persuade his father to move,
the medical student told him his
reason for ‘wanting to live in
New York was for “clinical rea-
sons.”

Forgets Reasons

_ “What reasons I had in rimind

I don’t remember but it did

change father’s mind about mov-

ing,” he said. Once in New York

he lived there for 20 years.
Before coming to Pitt Dr.

’—~Spock worked at the Mayo Clinic

and served in the navy for two
years during the last war.

game is being planned.

He went on to explain that the
ﬁrst‘ book, which sold over 4,-
000,000 copies took three years
of writing every evening to com-'
plete. “This,” he said, “is a
strain on myself and my family
and I wouldn’t want to expose
them to another three years of
the same.” ‘

Teaches on Family

In his classes at Arsenal
and Western
Psychiatric Hospital Dr. Spockvis
not only trying to teach the stu-
dents child psychology but also.

family relations. He instructsithe

students how to make friends a

with the child and how to co-
operate with other professions
that deal with children such as
teachers. ,

Speaking of the old medical
schools Dr. Spock said, “Back
before _all the sciences entered
medicine old doctors taught the
younger ones a bedside manner.
When science entered, these
methods were forgotten. ‘We are
trying to revitalize the profes-
sion by bringing back the- bed-
side manner.”

Word of Advice

Dr. Spock also had a word for
the undergraduates.- He said that
a lot of students have a desire to
be doctors but are afraid of s‘ci-
entiﬁc subjects. According to
him medical schools are putting
more emphasis on ability to get
along with people than on the
marks “suffered” in’ scientiﬁc
subjects. -

Before the race, Olson said, “I’ll
be satisﬁed if they run the two
miles in less than twelve min-
utes.” .

Well, almost everybody on the
team did just that with veterans
Bernie Luterancik and Don Delli
Gatti and soph Dick Weber pacing
the team with 9:53 times.

_W_e_ber ran thefour-mile course
Monday in the fast time of 23:53,
which is the lowest time recorded
in practice thus far.

Olson has been working the boys
on two-mile sprints to build up
their breathing and timing.

He:believes that if a runner has
the lead _at the end of the ﬁrst two

therefore is training the team ac-I
cordingly. _

John Michelosen Hopes
To Stop Rice & Co.

By WILL HLivKo

The Iowa Hawkeyes will be in for a rough afternoon to-
morrow when they clash with the Pitt Panthers at the
Stadium. There should definitely notbe any repeat of last
year’s 34-17 Hawkeye conquest.

Under Coach Red Dawson the Panthers are expected

I * to be the strongest since 1949. With ﬁrst—rate backs and

three capable quarterbacks to direct the offense, the Panthers
should roll. e

For - after an
absence of 14
y e a r s , John

Defensively, the Panthers should
be‘ able to stop the Hawkeyes and
their ace Left
H a l f b a c k
“Dusty” ‘R i c e.

Michelosen has
returned to Pitt
to help coach
the Panthers in
their struggle to
regain national
recognition as a
football power-
house.
Defense Catching On

Handpicked by Red Dawson,
the ex-Pittsburgh Steeler mentor
joined the Pitt staff in July to su-
pervise the Panthers’ defensive
backs. .

Since the ﬁrst week of practice
Michelosen has been keeping close
watch on the BIue‘—and—Gold de-
fense, pointing out and correcting
faults. And the Panthers have
been catching on fast.

Asked how it feels to coach col-
lege football after four years in
the National Football League,
Michelosen explained that in the
professional ranks a coach works
with a group of well—trained spe-
cialists. “One thing. I particularly
enjoy about coaching college foot-

Michelosen

ball,” the coach continued, “is that 5

 

I can watch the boys improve and
develop not only as good football
players but as men.”

Faced T Before

Though a strong advocate of the ,

single—wing form of attack, Mich-
elosen is no second-stringer when
it comes to defending against the
more popular T. Every team in

the National Football League used A

the T, against Michelosen’s Steel-
ers, thus giving the new Pitt asg
sistant many headaches but inval-
uable experience.

“Here at Pitt, we have a good
defensive team, a hard charging
line, good backs, and plenty of
spirit,” continued Michelosen.
“You know, the best pass defense
is a goodhard charging line. Our
defensive backs .are small
lively.” ‘

-Speaking of the Panthers’ line-
backers, Michelosen termed Cape
tain Joe Schmidt as one of the best
he has ever seen. “He hits as hard
as some pro players I’ve seen and
I think Joe will be ready for the
pro league next"year,” Michelosen
stated.

Following the precedent set‘by
most coaches, Michelosen refused
to make any predictions on the
coming season. His final comment
before entering the dressing room
at Ellsworth Field was, “Barring
any injuries, we’ll have a good
team. »

. Ex-NYU Coach To Scout  

‘Bay Scott, KDKA radio announcer, will broadcast Pitt football
games this year, replacing Woody Wolfe. He will be assisted by
Bill ‘Sutherland, who has handled the color description of Saturday's

"games for many years.

_The change of announcer and sponsor came as a. result of the
Atlantic Reﬁning Company’s decision to discontinue airing college

grid contests last spring. _¢

Although Wolfe drops out the
broadcasting spot, he will, how_-
‘ ever, still be very much apart of
the Pitt football picture. Coach
Red" Dawson, long time friend of
Woody, intends to use the ex—New

York University coach as a scout"

this fan.
Scott is not a newcomer to cov-
ering Pitt sporting events.» A few
, years ago Ray did several re-

‘ broadcasts of basketball games

from the Stadium pavilion.
Panther oﬁicials failed to get a

Hamilton's Shot ,
Pays Off Big

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

 

   

One year ago Captain Tom Hamilton, serving as interim

coach for the Panthers, announced before the Duke opener
that three green halfbacks would man his defensive back-
ﬁeld.’ ‘ s \ ‘ y
The decision was well taken by those who write about
Pitt football because there wasn’t .a thing anyone could do

That; Said that were

about it. Hamiltonwas stuck

could only string along with
the most impressive trio in
camp.

“I’ll go along with the best
I got,” the Captain said. How
good was his best? He didn’t
Say- A .
I None of ' them—Henry
Ford; Richie McCabe, or Ray

 

A Ferguson-—had ever played a minute in a varsity game. Half-

-backs Bob Wrabley and Chet Rice, who played defense, too,
also lacked experience.

-Cass Causes Trouble ,

It was a case of hit or miss. Hamilton’s long shot hit,
and as a result,Coach Red ‘Dawson will have a very capable
defensive array for tomorrow’s opener with Iowa.

What caused the shortage last year? Actually,‘i.t goes -

back to the 1950 season. Len Casanova’s poor defensive back-
ﬁeld that year cost the Panthers several of their eight losses.
An impartial observer at the Ohio State-Pitt game -in 1950
had this ‘to say after the Buckeyes crushe_d Cass’ team,‘41-7.
“I saw the Duke game last week,”'he stated, “and I
saw this coming. Pitt absolutely has no pass defense, and
Ohio State capitalized on it.” .
Tips from ‘Mike’ _ ‘
' “Pitt still ‘has a top line, but they’re sadly lacking a
pass defense.” _ i
“ ‘ In tomorrow’s game Ford will return to safety and at

t the halves will~be Mr. Wrabley and Mr. Rice. All three have

gained experience and with the tips picked up from John
Michelosen they should be more eﬁective against the Hawk-
eyes. Ferguson has been shifted to linebacker because he’s

__ needed more at that spot.

The only thing that’s keeping McCabe out of the lineup
is a mending knee. Richie is resting after an operation_to
remove cartilage and probably will return for the Army game.
