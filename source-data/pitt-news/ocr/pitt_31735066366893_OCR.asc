" lationship.

“We are extremely fortunate
to be. able to takeadvantage of
Mr. Martin’s unique talents in
this ﬁeld,” gtated Dr. Kurtzman.
“His breath of experience in coun-
ty, state, and private develop-
ment will be invaluable’ to us as

state. relationship. and how our
own exp_ansion must go forward

.in effective harmony with the

community's plans and those of
our neighboring institutions.”

Committee Formed

A Committee on World Cul-
tures to formulate\courses in that
ﬁeld has recently been formed,
according to Dean of Liberal Arts
James A. Kehl. Dean Kehl com-
mented that the progress made
by the Committee “is such that
we should expect ‘to have courses
in the Asian and Russian areas in
operation in the Winter Trimester
1966-67.” Kehl added that “con-
ceivably the Latin American
course can be in pilot form at
the same time.” \

The one-term courses are plan-
ned in each of the three divisions,
humanities, natural sciences, and

‘social sciences. One course will

deal with the traditional civiliza-
tion and the other with modern
civilization of the given area. Ac-
cording to current plans, either
term of an area course may be
taken without the other for dis-
tribution credit.

Kehl explained that “there is
no thought at present to have a

’ requirement per se in World Cul-

tures; our aim is to develop
courses that acquire such reputa-

the transfer students to partici-
pate in their respective areas.

Dean Herbert McGibbeny, Dean
Savina Skewis, Mrs. Frances Hol-

land, Dr. Dr. John Geise, vice- ,_

chancellor for regional programs,

also greeted the studentson be- 

half of the administration.

' ~Dr. Geise spoke about the know-
ledge that one ‘could learn out-
side the‘ classroom. “A student
should acquire a technique which
will enable him to seek know-
ledge when he needs it in his ca-
reer. M We should concentrate on
becoming professionals in what-
eversﬁeld we choose and not be
fascinated with theory.”

‘ . Geise ended with a note'6f"‘sad-
ness when he stated this would -

tion that they need not be re-
quired to attract a large percen-
tage of the students.”

The Committee on World Cul-
tures is working through the‘ area
committees established earlier by
Dean of the Division of Social
Sciences Richard L. Park, with
Janet G. Chapman, economics lec-
turer; Irwin "J. Schulman, politi-
cal science instructor; and Cole
Blaisier, ‘associate professor of
political science, as chairmen.

“These committees, independent
of each other, reached the com-
mon conclusion that all of the
courses should have a historical
framework and that an historian
should be charged of each,” Kehl
pointed out.

“It is planned to have numer-
ous ‘lecturers come into these
courses for which the historians
will be responsible,” Kehl said,
adding that “it is quite possible
that the modern civilization
courses particularly may from
time to time be handled by ei-
ther of the area specialists.”

_ Recent proposals put before the State House and Senate seem to
.,point to an inevitable state-relation for the University. While members of
zthe University Community should be gratiﬁed that such beneﬁts for their
school are forthcoming, there still is reason for concern. How will the
lillniversity adjust its academic and non-academic programs to accommo-
date the increased numbers of students? . '
 _ ‘Acting Chancellor David Kurtzman has predicted that the impact
of the state-relation will mean an addition in enrollment of approximately
 ‘,000. Students and faculty should be included in the planning for the de-
;;velopment of increased University facilities. I
._ ‘Students at the University fear that the state-relation will mean
-reduction in the quality of teaching and thus a lowering of standards for
admission. If the students only see an increase in the enrollment and no
programs aimed at accommodating_ the large student body, then fears are

Students surmise that such discussions on planning are going on
behind closed doors. This planning must come out from behind the closed
doors and be presented to faculty and students. An open dialogue of critical
analysis should follow.

Dr. Charles Peake, vice-chancellor for the academic disciplines, has
paved the way for such a dialogue with the appointment of a committee to
study instructional technology. Such investigations by the University of
means of handling large groups of students are critically needed. More-
over, Dr. Peake has made public his planning, so as to permit discussion
of these new techniques for learning.

As the state-relation draws near and public planning by the admin-
istration is not forthcoming, the fears of students and faculty will grow.
The administration must publically demonstrate how in. other areas he-
sides the academic disciplines, the University will adjust to this growth.

Abolish Grading System

Associated Collegiate Press

The present stratiﬁed system
grading should be abolished, says
the Technician, North Carolina
State University.

The Technician said in an edi-
torial:

Instead of the 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, a
system of pass or fail based on

oral and written examinations at

the end of the semester or year
should be instituted.

The need for the eradication of
the present system is shown quite
clearly during exam time when
students begin cramming, crib-
bing and crabbing with. the, hope
of passing or making a higher
grade. The. grade therefore is
used as negative reinforcement;
if you don’t work the grade will
be low and if you fail, you might
not be able to return to school.
Another factor is the Selective
Service, which bases draft defer-

ments partially on accumulative
grade point averages.

In all cases, the reinforcement
is negative. Students with 3.0 or
better averages tend to wear
them as shields Whereas the 2.0
or lower student rationalizes his
low grades. And there’s no cer-
tainty that a graduate with a
high average is better educated
than a compatriot with lower

marks.

If it is accepted that the pri-
mary objective of a university is
to. produce educated people
rather than human tape record-
ers or super-specialists with vast

knowledge in one ﬁeld and very‘

little in others, then a grading
system becomes superﬂuous.
When graduation time draws
near, the determining factor in
presenting a degree should be the
total knowledge and understand-

ing obtained by the student in his
four or ﬁve yearsat: the univer-
sity. Doubtless to say, many of
today’s graduates would not pass
such an examination, whether it
was oral, written or a combina-
tion of the two.

Under such a. system, a student
would be judged against both
what the faculty decides he
should know and the knowledge
of. his peers. At th-e same time,
a different approach to classroom
instruction would be easily as-
similated by the faculty as the
constant need for numerical‘
grades would be eliminated and
more time‘ could be devoted to
guiding educational progress.

Many schools and universities
have already successfully adopt-
ed such a plan. It can and will
work, and although its adoption
will not create an educational or

intellectual nirvana, it will aid _

the educational process.

 Letters to the Editori

Warning Offered

. To Journal Editors

This is in response to the edi-
torial in the March 30, 1966, is-
sue of The Pitt News. ‘

_I would like to thank you for
the effort you have made in start-

‘ing a literary journal for the

University. But, unless this is- just
your own personal collection of
poems andnot an outlet for the
poets of the University, I can see
no justification for your restric-_
tion of the mood of the writing on
Cathedral I. ‘

Poetry is a written expression

of an individual’s ideas and views

of life, the world, etc. Whether
a writer curses the world, human
life, or praises,_ each has no bear-

ing on whether or not he is a V

good poet. Each one of these writ-’
ers has the right to express his
views and, if there is a University

Journal of Poetry, the right to,

have his poems considered not
on his views but on the quality
of work. As editors of a poetry
journal, your job is not to govern

the type of poems, but to select V

the best written poems to be
printed.

How can you say you “have
opened the ﬂood gates of creativ-

ity” when the first thing you do
is to cast out many poems and
poets whose ideas are contrary to
your own. You are thus doing
exactly what Dr. Morris Berke-
witz accused the faculty of doing
— “Trying to force "knowledge
into disciplinary packages and
only discussing the topics. from
their own point of view.”

I hope that Cathedral I is suc-
cessful in becoming a. true and
accurate outlet for all the poets
of this University. _

Student Condemns

Poetry Journal
Most of Professor Crow’s stu-
dents think highly of him and of

his integrity. I know I speak for .

them when I say that we‘ are

sorry he became involved in as ,

shabby a project as Cathedral 1,
its sponsor, and private publica-
tion. A self-respecting poet scorns
the vanity press. Even I could

get my bad poetry printed if I

stopped that. low.

The University should_ be”

ashamedpof this proposal and of
asking students to contribute

moneyto it, as Professor Lee has I

done. _

ROOMMATES REVISITED

This morning’s mail brought a letter from a student at
a prominent Western university (Princeton). “Dear Sir,”
he writes. “In a recent column you said it was possible to
get along with your roommate if you try hard enough.
Well, I’d like to see anyone get along with my roommate!
Mervis Trunz (for that is his name) practices the Ocarina
all night long, keeps an alligator, wears knee-cymbals, and
collects airplane tires. I have tried everything I can with
Mervis Trunz, but nothing works. I am desperate. (signed)
Desperate.”

Have you, dear Desperate, really tried everything‘? Have
you, for example, tried a measure so simple, so obvious,
that it is easy to overlook? I mean, of course, have you of-
fered to share your Personnai" Super Stainless Steel Blades
with Mervis Trunz‘?

To have a friend, dear Desperate, you must be a friend.
And what could be more friendly than sharing the bounty
of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades? Who, upon en-
joying the luxury of Personna, the nickless, scrapeless, tug-
less, hackless, scratchless, matchless comfort of Personna,
the ease and breeze, the power and glory, the truth and
beauty of Personna—who, I say, after such jollies could
harden his heart against his neighbor? Nobody, that’s who
—not even Mervis Trunz——especially not today with the

 new Personna Super Blade bringing us new highs in speed,
' comfort, and durability. And here is still a further bonus:

Personna is available both in Double Edge style and Injec-
tor style. _ -

 

No, dear Desperate, your problem with Mervis Trunz is
far from insoluble. In fact, as roommate problems go, it is
pretty small potatoes. Compare it, for example, to the clas-
sic case of Basil Metabolism and E. Pluribus Ewbank.

Basil and E. Pluribus, roommates’ aha prominent East-
ern university (Oregon) were at an impassable impasse.
Basil could study only late at night, and E. Pluribus could

V not stay awake past nine p.m. If Basil kept the lights on,

the room was too_ bright for E. Pluribus to sleep. If E. Pluri-
bus turned the lights off, the room was too dark for Basil

' to study. What to do? '

Well sir, these two intelligent American kids found an
answer. They got a miner’s cap for Basil! Thus, he had

‘enough light-_to study by, and still the room‘ was dark

enough for E. Pluribus to sleep. L
_1 It must be admitted, however, that this ingenious solu-
tion had some unexpected sequelae. Basil got so enchanted

with his miner’s cap that he switched his major from 18th A

Century poetry to mining and metallurgy.‘ Shortly after
graduation he had what appeared to be a greatstroke of
luck: _while out prospecting, he discovered what is without
question the world’s largest feldspar mine. This might have
made Basil very rich except that nobody, alas, has yet dis-
covered a use for feldspar. Today Basil, a broken man,
squeezes out a meagre living as a stalagmite in Ausable
Chasm. -

Nor has E. Pluribus fared conspicuously better. Once

Basil got the miner’s cap, E. Pluribus was able to catch up ’

‘on his long—los't sleep. He woke after nine days, refreshed
_and vigorous—more vigorous, alas, than he realized. It was
the afternoon of the Dean’s tea. E. Pluribus stood in line
with his classmates, waiting to shake the Dean’s hand. At
last his turn came,-and E. Pluribus, full of strength and
health, gave the Dean 21 ﬁrm handshake—so ﬁrm, indeed,‘
that all ﬁve of the Dean’s knuckles were permanently fused.
“ The Dean sued for a million dollars and, of course, won.
Today E._Pluribus, a broken man, is paying off his debtby
walking the Dean’s cat every afternoon for ten cents an hour.

  German Aid To China  

Protested By Students

Collegiate News Service
Almost two hundredstudentsifrom Washington, D.C.,
area colleges and universities demonstrated outside the
West German Embassy last weekend against West Ger-
many’s decision to help ﬁnance a $150 million steel mill in

Communist China.

Students from George Washington University, Ameri-
can University, Georgetown University, and the University
of Maryland carried placards and signs for several hours,
April 2, protesting against the German decision.

Signs and placards read: “No
Steel for Red China, “Will Ger-
man Steel Be Used to Kill Amer-
icans in Red China,” and “If Steel
Isn’t Strategic, What Is?”

The last sign referred to an ex-

planation of the ‘West Germany

government that ‘steel mills are

not “strategic.”

The student demonstration in
Washington followed an an-
nouncement by West Germany
that it has agreed to guarantee a
ﬁve-year credit of $87.5 million to
help build a $150 million steel
mill in Communist China.

Bill Williams of Washington,
D. C., commented last Saturday:

Medical Student
To Participate In
Research Project

Nicholas J. Feduska, a junior
in the School of Medicine, will
participate in a medical research
meeting to be held in Galveston,
Texas, Friday. Feduska will rep-
resent the University at the Uni-

versity of Texas Medical Branch’s '

seventh annual Student Research
Forum. He will present a paper
entitled “Preferential Localiza-
tion of Hematogenously Distri-
buted Malignant Tumor Cells at
Sites of Trauma.”

The paper is a report of studies
the medical student conducted
during the School’s Summer Re-
search Program this past year.
Supported primarily by a grant
from the National Institute of
Health, the program offers stu-
dents angopportunity for personal
investigation, with faculty spon-
sorship, of clinical or basic sci-
ence problems. Each student en-
gaged in the summer program
receives a $750 stipend.

On Safety In

Fraternity houses are not ﬁre-
proof, as shown by the destruc-
tlon of the Sigma Nu House at
Penn State last winter and Zeta
Beta Tau at Michigan State, Win-
ter, 1965.

In an attempt to remove the
"causes of fires, the American Mu-
tual Insurance Alliance of Chi-
cago, has put out a booklet en-
titled, “Is Your Chapter House
Fire-Safe?”

According to the booklet, the
principal cause of ﬁres is care-
less smoking and match disposal.
Nearly 25 per cent of 260 frater-
nity house ﬁres analyzed by the
National Fire Protection Associa-
tion were caused by this factor.

Among the suggestions for mak-
ing fraternity and sorority houses
safe are six steps, including the
appointment of an upper-class
“ﬁre ward-en” who would con-
duct monthly inspections, and
take steps to correct dangerous

situations.

Other items in the safety pro-
gram include the reminder_ to
check construction in new fra-
ternity houses and the automatic
sprinkler systems. Have open
‘ staircases with ﬁre barrier doors

or some enclosure. Include prop-
er sized fire extinguishers on
every floor and permit no smok-
_ ing in bed.

nounced the newly selected mem-
bers of his Cabinet." Chosen were
juniors Arthur Popkave, Lynne
Thomas, Karen Leppo, Terry Hy-

Popkave’s activities include
serving as president of Zeta Beta

After choosing his Cabinet,
Sacks, a junior honors history
major, stated his next responsi-

the Liberal Arts Cabinet.
toughest test facing us now is
that the identity of the Cabinet

 doesn’t exist,” Sacks explained.

“In the past, the Cabinet has not
been used to its fullest advan-
tage, with the student body not
realizing what the Cabinet does
or what it is,” he added.

Sacks deﬁned the LA Cabinet
as “the only student organization

The ‘immediate impact of the
University's becoming a. state-re-
lated school would be to reduce
the tuition and increase the en-
rollment by approximately 1,000
students, according to Dr. Kurtz-
man. The State Board of Higher
Education offered three varia-
tions of the tuition cut: 1) $450

pose of the Cabinet is to act as
a sounding board and to work
with Dean Kehl and,the heads
of _department to iron out the
problems and changes which we
feel merit study in the academic
program.”

Commenting on the various
functions the Cabinet could ful-
ﬁll, Sacks remarked that Project
Teach “should have come under
the auspices of the Cabinet. We’re
the only authorized body to do
this, in my own opinion, as well
as certain members of the admin-
istration’s.” ’

 Pittsburgh Playhouse To Feature
‘The Knack’ and ‘Typist’ 81 ‘Tiger’

 

With a focus on outstanding
plays of the 1960’s, the Pittsburgh
Playhouse features three plays
this spring, Ann Jellicoe’s The
Knack, the off-Broadway, award-
winning plays, The Typistsa and
The Tiger.

The Knack, which opened orig-
inally in 1962 at London’s Little
Royal Theatre, stars Jordan Char-

the results when a new-girl-in-
town stumbles upon Tolan and
his pals while searching for the
YMCA. Each of the three men
try to prove his “knack” in win-
ning her.

The KnIack' features Jennifer
Darling, a recent graduate of
Carnegie Institute of Technology
as “the girl,” and will play
through May 15.

Opening on May 14,. The Typ-
ists and The Tiger deal with the
problems of youth facing the dis-
enchantment of reality. Written
by Murray Schisgut, the. two
plays have won the Vernon Rice
and Outer Circle Awards for ex-
cellence. ,

The Typists is set in a mail or-
der house, with Paul Cunning-
ham as a temporary employee
and Sylvia Payton, his idealistic
supervisor. The two characters
are shown in the set pattern of
life to which fate has relegated
them.

Also a two-character play, The
Tiger concerns Ben, an intelligent
but slightly unstrung young man

revolting against authority. One,

day he kidnaps Gloria who is to
be his obedient victim. Much to

his surprise, Gloria proves quite
cooperative.

the Playhouse may be obtained

But we wrote a song for Sprite anyway. We'd.like you
to sing it while drinking Sprite, though this may

what about the taste of Sprite? It's good. It's '

' _ gas‘ 32- .TH ' «PIT. 

.. By GEORGE LIES
- -Last Saturday, the Pan-
. therifootball team ended
Spring practice with its an-
nual intra-squad game. It cli-
maxed "a “get acquainted” period
for new head coach Dave Hart
and the players. Except for a’
few exciting plays, Hart express-
Qed disappointment over the re-
sults of the game.
 “We looked awful out there,”
A Hart said. “Our. timing was poor.
 offense was not striking, they
."'were leaning‘ in to the defense._
Instead of cutting down people,
they were chicken ﬁghting.”
.’ Hart prefers the lean aggres-
sive type of lineman but in the
 game “the only fast thing they
‘ did was break from the huddle
I and lineup,” he said. ‘
5 "V “In the second half we short-
, .ened the time and allowed the
 ;,- clock to run out because the boys
‘ were tired,” Hart continued. “We
, had a lay off for ﬁnals and they
 are not used to the hard pace.
 ‘ I ,“There is no question about it,”
. Hart said, “these boys are not in
shape. The biggest thing we did
accomplish was getting to know
,_ them and they learned our sys-
5 tern. Right now we all wish we
were going to Summer camp to-
morrow.”
~ From his performance in' the
game “(Jim) Flanigan belongs in
that middle linebacker position,”
.Hart said. “Flanigan roamed
-around and played very well.
_ “Both quarterbacks (Ed James
. and Mike Elliot) looked erradic,”'
 continued. “At times they
held the ball too low, lost their.
poise and ended up throwing side
arm. ‘
“I think we found something
-/in Chip Rife,” Hart said. “He’l1
_-‘give (Bob) Longo a hard time
.for?‘*that starting split end spot.”
Rife caught four passes for 50
yards in the game.
Hart found he also had another
Quarterback in Elliot who passed
“for 9.0 yards in leading the White
,team to victory, 14-10. “Elliot

Baseball Team Meets

Veteran Mounties

With Fred Mazurek’s bat miss-
ing from this year’s baseball line-
up, Coach Bobby Lewis has been
forced to rely on pitching and
stiff defensive ball. There is only
one trouble with such a combina-
tion. It needs practice and the

 

Hampered by injuries and lack
of practice, the track team moves
on to its second test of the young
season—the Penn Relays this Sat-

urday. Last week in the Ohio Re- ,

lays, the tracksters made no great
showing but coach Carl Rees was
very optimistic in his ‘praise of
senior Dick Crout.

Running anchorman on both
the 440 and the mile relay teams,
Crout trailed four men in both
events. However, he passed two
men to ﬁnish second in the mile;
in the 440 time trial he placed
third. Crout’s running on the last
leg brought the trackmen in sixth
in each event.

“Crout looks like he is coming
into his own in his senior year,”
Rees said. “He is doing things

’ have combined to hamper the
mitters as much as possible.
The baseball team takes a 3-1
record down to West Virginia to-
day. Two games, with Bucknell
and Georgetown, were rained out.
What makes the record seem
frail is the fact that the Moun-
taineers will have already played

Bob Longo,
Joe Curtin

Perk Up

By TOM SACKS

Sports Editor
Football’s Dave Hart can't
perform miracles, but what
he has done in the recently
completed Spring practice must

be the next best thing-

Since Hart and his staff have
moved in, two of the unhappiest
Panthers on last year’s squad
have been undergoing a face lift-
ing. The Hart guided operation on
juniors Joe Curtin and Bob Lon-
go is nearing completion and the
results will play a major role in
next year’s campaign.

As a freshman, Curtin was one
of the starting halfbacks. Last
year he was switched to defense
without being given a reason and
saw only limited action for the
rest of the season.

“I guess I was one of the most
disappointed players on the team
nearly all of my incentive and I
was hardly ever given any de-
fensive advice.

After watching him in Spring
practice, Hart plans to start Cur-
tin next year in the territory he
likes best—the offensive back-
ﬁeld.

Longo saw some action last
year, but the taste of that little
bit made him hungry for more.
He never got it.

“I was just miserable last year,”
said Longo. “I couldn't stand sit-
ting on the bench. I just wanted
to play. They never said a word
about why I couldn’t start. It was
just my opinion against theirs
and I guess I was a little bitter.”

Next fall, he has a starting
berth waiting for him at split
end. One of the major. reasons
given by Michelosen's staff last
year for not starting Longo was
that he didn’t want to block. For
some reason under their guid-
ance he still didn’t want to block..

“If I had kept my big mouth
shut, I guess I wouldn’t have got-
ten in trouble,” says Bob. “I
didn’t try to hide it. I don't like
to block on the line. I play to
win and I play best when it’s me
against the defender alone down-
ﬁeld.”

Hart feels’ Longo’s blocking
picked up during the Spring and
that he's ready to handle the
downﬁeld block.

Coach Rex Peery and his golf-
ers are “optimistic about their
chances in tomorrow’s match at
Bucknell. According to Peery,
there has been a “marked im-
provement” in the team since
the beginning of the year.

After their spring vacation lay-
off, the golfters joined the base-
ball team on a short Southern
