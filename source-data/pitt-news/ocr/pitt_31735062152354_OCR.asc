Marching Order

Opening with a pep meeting 011
the steps of State hall at 12:30
o’clock today, more than 1.000 _1f1tt
students will revive an old tradition
when they parade_through the down-
town section of Pittsburgh;

The parade was discontinued last
year and a bonﬁre pep ineetlng Sub-
stituted in its place, University Of‘
ﬁcials believing the latter method a
better means of celebrating the com-
ing game. The bonﬁre pep meetin-g,
however, did not meet with much
approval from the Pitt students and
when a poll was taken through the
Pitt Weekly to decide which form of
celebration the students preferred,
the downtown parade was a unani-
mous choice. . , .

No Permission Granted ,

University officials have not given
their consent for the parade,‘ but
they will take no steps to stop the
students from celebrating in antici-
pation of the Carnegie Tech game.
The following announcement was
made from the chancellor’s office
this week in regard to the game:

“The University has not granted
speciﬁc authority nor denied the stu-
dents the right to hold a parade in

ticipation of the _Pitt, Carnegie
. ech game, but in view of the fact
that it has coii_imIssioned_ Monday to
be a holiday in case Pitt wins, it
cannot grant excuses to students.
who absent themselves from sched-
uled classes in order to march in the
parade.” _ _

Despite the latter condition, no
great decrease in - the. anticipated
number of student marchers is ex-

’ . The ﬁfth hour will be elimi-
nated from today’s schedule.

Emanuel Fishkm, Bus. ‘Ad. ‘31,
chairman of student council assem-
bly committee, has completed ar-
rangements with city officials and
the students will. be unmolested
throughout the parade. .

Peter J. Walsh, superintendent of
city police, has promised a police es-
cart for this game. Neither auto_m_o-
biles nor street cars will be permit-
ted to run through the sections

Break Ground
For Institute

Excavation "Begun For New
Mellon Science Building

 

In the presence of the officials
and fellows of the Mellon Insti-
tute, a steamshovel broke ground for
the new building of the Mellon In-
stitute, at Fifth avenue and Belle-
ﬁeld street, last Wednesday morn-
ing, November 5, at 9:30 o’clock.

The contract for the excavation
for the magniﬁcent new structure,
latest addition to Oakland’s crown
of 3I‘C1l1..eCl3l11’3.l. masterpieces, was
let last week to the Navarro om-
pany, which has begun operations
with three steamshovels. Mellon
Stuart Company is the general con-

tractor.
A Lot of Dirt!

The excavation work will entail

the removal 01' 100,000 cubic yards
of earth. Thirty-ﬁve thousand cu-
bic yards of the earth removed from
the property will be used for ﬁll-
ing in Frick Acres around the Ca-
thedral of Learning, where exten-
sive grading operations are-in prog-
ress. The excavation for the new
building of the institute will be the
greatest ever made in the l’i.ts-
burgh district. Prior to this time,
the removal of 90,000 cubic yards of
earth for the new Allegheny Gen-
eral Hospital held the record.
" It is expected that the excavation
for the foundation of the new build-
ing will be completed in 90 days af-
ter which all walls will be placed.
Construction will be carried on as
rapidly as possible. According to
present plans, the new building, the
greatest laboratory home in the
world, will be occupied within two
Years of the present date.

With Round Of Events

F r e s li in a n Eligibility

Rushing Now
Changed

With the ringing of the 8:30 bell
yesterday morning, a twentieth cen-
tury miracle occurred at the Uni-
versity. .After being contemptous-
ly “froshed” by upperclassmen for
two months, many of the 976 fresh-
men suddenly found themselves the
object of fraternity men's atten-

were. suddenly catapulted into‘ a
dizzy round of lunches, smokers,
dances and entertainment.

New Innovations

Two, outstanding features distin-
guish the present rushingiperiod. At
present every man at t e Univer-
sity is eligible for lodging, whereas
under former eferred‘ rushin
rules he was obliged to have earn_e
twelve credits and twelve quality
points to establish his eligibility.
However, under the present system,
a student must have earned his
"twelve-twelve” before he can be in-
itiated.

In addition, if a student who has
not earned his “twelve-twelve’_’_ 1S
pledged, in the event of his failing
to do so the following semester, _he
must automatically return his pin,
and is not eligible for further ledg-
ing until he has met these sc olas-
tic regulations. .
Another feature of the present
rence. Previous defe red rushing

lace at Elie beginning

were originally fromi_November 7 to

= Mayor Issues Football Proclamation

 

Editor's Note--The proclamation published herewith. relative to.
some tomorrow, was given exclusively
to the Pitt Weekly for publication by the Honorable Charles H. Kline,
Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh.

' Tai-tans is no longer just a football game. It is now a Pittsburgh
* institution occupying a place of supreme interest in the hearts and
minds of our citizenry. I I

This is due to the fact that while we, as a
community, do not blast our trumpet of boast as
-loudly as some of our neighbors, we all know
that both these two schools from an educational
standpoint area
are aﬁording our youth unprecedented opportu-
nity to ﬁt themselves for the-battle of life.

_ , While there is competition between them, it
is a competition in which there is no bitter
jealousy in their ever expanding and continuing
efforts to lead in the onward march of progress.’
Therefore both Pitt and-Tech‘ symbolizethepspirlt

enshrined in the heart of Pittsburgh’s people.

Their combats. on the gridiron each year,
while marked by keen rivalry, serve to einpliasize:
. A . oneach. recurring occasion that, while both strive

for honor, bo_th- squads, by their_actions, ‘proclaim qualities of high
icharacter, fair ‘play, sportsmanlike demeanor, gameness‘ in defeat
and generosity in victory. Thus do they win laurels for themselves
-and admiration for their alma mater. - _
All Hail to»Pitt: All Hail to Tech. —

Pittsburgh‘ is always. ready to cheer-the winner
. too, because they ‘alwaysbring glory to her name.

It ordalns tomorrow as official

the Pitt Panthers. and the Tech

the peer of any in the land and

and both, in turn, are equally

and the" loser,

Must Join National

_ By a vote of 6 to 4 this week, the
rateriiity committee of the Univer-
dlty approved the petition of Pitt
students ‘interested in organizing a
local Jewish fraternity’ on the cam-

Eus. ‘ Beta Tau is the name adopted
y . members of. the. ‘ group, whose
constitution and organization were
formally recognized by the commit-
tee after a. deliberation of more
than, a week, occasioned by the lil-
ing of objections by the ﬁve Jewish
graternities already established at

itt.- I ' . .

The approval ﬁilvenby the com-
mittee carries wit it the ‘provision

that recognition of the local may be ‘

withdrawn, if the members fail to
affiliate with a national fraternity
during the present school year.
Those sponsoring the new local have
expressed conﬁdence that they
would shortly become members of a
prominent national Jewish frater-
nity, saying that overtures having
already been made to them by the
national organization. .
Elect Oﬁicers

At a meeting held immediately

tee’s approval, members of the

torian? H. Lawrence Spiegelglass,

Objections to formation of Beta
Tau were filed with the fraternity
committee last week by Sigma Al-
pha Mu, Phi Epsilon Pi, Kappa Nu,
Pi Lambda Phi and Phi Beta Delta
stating that there was insufficient
material among Jewish students en-
rolled at Pitt for a sixth fraternal

oup.

Edward Hirschberg, president of
Beta Tau, intimated that the group
would shortly open a house on the
campus and would actively partici-
pate in the rushing‘ season which is
now in (progress. he group is also
expecte to petition Interfraternity
Council for membership, he said.

Behaoed On Nebraska
Trip, Says Dean Sieg

“The boys were unusually
well conducted. No one would
have thought it was a football
team, judging from the lack of
noise. The trip was well man-
aged, everything going accord-
ing to schedule,“ said Lee Paul
Sieg, dean of the college, who
accompanied the team to Ne-
braska last week.

“The spirit was good. We
had a good, heavy team, better
in fact than the one from No-
braska. Under different circum-
stances, I feel that we would
have won.”

Mr. Sieg was the only mem-
ber of the faculty to accom-
pany the team, the only other
adults being the coaches and
trainers.

An interesting part of the
trip home on Sunday, was the
meeting with Don Saunders,
former Pitt publicit man. Mr.
Saunders boarded t e train in
Illinois at 7:30, had breakfast
with the Pitt team, and stayed
with them until he reached Chi-
cago at 9:00.

husbands ﬁrmly resolve to stand up
for their rights, the male wasp sets
the record for being the most meek
of males. The male wasp submits
to a complete domination by the
females, who are powerful and
what is worse, know it. The fe-
males, to make things decidedly in
their favor, boast the only weapon
of the species, a powerful stinger
which paralyzes and kills.

Quito defenseless and without
means of obtaining any other food,
the males live on honey while, on
the other hand, the females, who
are of the true Amazon species of
womanhood, kill caterpillars, feed
on the flesh and‘ ﬁnally lay their
eggs -on the carcasses. The fe-
males, by the way, lay several bun-
dred eggs at a time, a feat not com-
mon among inspects of that class.

Dr. Whiting stated in conclusion
that through the study of the traits
and inherited characteristics r‘ of
wasps, human problems could be
solved. And so our winsome lss-‘
siep, whom everyone declares looks
just like her mother, may owe her
good looks to some ancient ancestor
who roamed the forests of the stone
age in lion skins.

ing on a section of the Perry
highway that is being built
over a ‘swamp near Conneaut
Lake, is in charge of the night
shift, meanwhile doing his re-
quired co-operative work for
the Engineering Department.
The men are working day and
night trying to ﬁll this swamp
with dirt to make it safe for
the new highway.

The swamp is one-third of a
mile wide and they are ﬁlling
this width as a resting place
for the new road. They have
been working for the last two
months putting 4,000 cubic
yards of dirt a. day——this
amount is equal to ten Alumni
Halls-in the swamp. Now with
all this work they have about
thirty feet of the road com-
pleted.

Men's Singers Practice For
Xmas Festival

 

Even if the‘ members of the Men's
Glee Club aren’t doing their Christ-
mas shopping early they have al-
ready started to practice for the an-
nual. Yuletide Festival. The boys
are working with the Womeu’s Glee
Club and the Pitt Players in the pro-
duction of a musical Skit portraying
all the fun and frolic of an‘ old Eng-
lish Christmas celebration in the hall
of a. manor lord.

The familiar carols and songs of
Old England are now beingpracticed
by the Glee Club under the direction
of Walter H. Wright, faculty direc-
tor, and Clarence Sober, Dent.“ ’32,,
student director.

Mr. Wright is using‘ a new system
in selecting this year’s varsity quar-
tette. The members of the club have
been divided into groups of four so
that the four best voices can be se-
lected from the smaller groups. -

Percy Rowland, Col. ’31, manager

is also trying to arrange a two or
three-day trip to some a city in. the
northern part of Pennsylvania. or
New- York. ‘

I The two pianists of the club -are
well knownfor their ability. James
F. Reed, Col. ’32, has played for the

the Universit orchestra. Wesley
Linsendigler, d. ’32, is the assistant
organist of the First Baptist Church
of Oakland.

With the organizations working
at all practice sessions, the Yuletide
Festival should be a brilliant per-
formance. ~

Hard Times Hit Jobs
For Women Workers

 

 

The general business depression
has affected the -em loyment of
women students, acco . ing to Miss
Isabelle Anderson. assistant to the
dean of women, and in charge. of
the Employment Bureau for Women.

_“I do not have so many calls for
girls to do part-time work, such as
stenographic work and caring’ for
children,” said Miss Anderson.
“This,” she continued‘, “is probably
due to the fact that any number of
people who are not working ‘regu-
larly are willing to take these part-
time jobs.” V

As an instance of this Miss An-
derson remarked that by this time
of the year, as a rule, there are a
great number of women students
working in the department stores.
This yearpthere have been very few
calls for saleswomen among the
girls u to the present time.

On t e other hand, while there are
fewer posltions avails c, more
girls are applying for work this
year. It is interesting to note that
on November 8, in spite of the fact
there Is a large football: game in

Break Frosh Rules

Violations of the Customs com-
mittee rules by freshmen are less
this year than last year. This an-
nouncement was made by Hermine
Ruoff, Col. ’31, chief justice of Sen-
ior Court. The enthusiasm of the
freshmen women has been excep-
tional, and the attitude they are
showmg Is very good in her opin-
Ion.

Senior Court is well satisﬁed with
the way the new system for com-
mittees started last year is work-

In .

The policy requires that no wom-
an be active on more than one com-
mittee. This gives more women an
opportunity to show themselves.
Working on committees is deter-
mined by scholastic standing, num-
ber of quality points and ability.

“Committees on campus have
proved fundamental in training
good chairmen and dependable
workers, and finally, leaders in of-
ﬁces,” states Miss Ruoff.

Freshman Placement
Test Figures Reveal
Future Possibilities

Research Department
Head Grants Frosh
High Average

In the freshman class of the Uni-
versity, 115 students, ranked in the
upper 10 per cent by placement tests,

 

have from 96 to 98 chances in 100 '

of making a passing grade or better
during the present school year; those
in the second tenth have from 92 to
96 chances out of 100_ to pass suc-
cessfully; and those in the lowest
tenth from 10 to 17 chances in 100
to become sophomores, if the present
class runs true to form, according to
ﬁgures released this week by Dr.
Walter B. Jones, head of the Re-
search Department of the Univer-
sity.

Announcement was also made of
the first ten students who ranked
highest in the combined placement
tests. Their names and high schools
from which they graduated follow:

Ernest H. Plesset, Peabody; Rus-
sell Wallace, Rochester; Homer R.
Montague, Dormant; Mary Eliza-
beth McKin.n1s, Blairsville and Penn
Hall; Grace B. Banning, Bellevue;
Joseph Dallas, Allegheny; Howard
DeForest, Stowe township; David_J.
Kusler, Allegheny; Harold M. Cohen,
Schenley, and Robert J. Wessner,
Harding High of Warren, Ohio.

Based on Tests

The ﬁndings of the department are
based on results obtained in the
standardized lacement tests iven
to 1,150 mem rs of the fres man
class during the week of Septem-
ber 15. The phances of success given
each group have been arbitrarily set
by the department after an exten-
sive investigation of plevious classes
at both Pitt and other leading uni-
versities in the country.

Other statistics brought out in the
tests revealed that the freshman
class at Pitt had a higher average
than the general average obtained
from the results of the tests ad-
ministered to 34,500 students in 131
other American universities and
colleges. ‘

Pitt Ranks High

In the standardizedvreading tests,
Pitt students also ranked" almost
three points on the average higher
in every tenth division than the av-
erage obtained by students in the
181 other colleges.

Commenting on the satisfactory
lhowing of the Pitt freshmen, Dr.
Jones said that he was both pleased
and not a little favorably surprised.
The tests have been given at Pitt
for the past three years and the
general average has remained pretty
nearly constant according to the di-
rector. The 1,150 students tested
this year was the largest group ever
to receive the tests here.

The P111'P0Be of the tests is to en-
able University administrative offi-
cers to forecast in some measure the
chances of success for each first

student enrolled in the school.
1: is also possible to place students
in colle e on the basis of ability
rather t an on time served in high
school. Those who rank lowest will
be ‘given opportunities for faculty
assistance and every effort will be
made to improve their standing.
Those in the highest ranks will be

'ven favorable chances to develop
t eir potential abilities to the best
advantages, according to Dr. Jones.

Cadets Drill
For Tomorrow

Aim To Overwhelm Tech
Corps; To Lead Parade

 

Encouraged with the showing
made by both the battalion band and
the cadet corps at the Notro Dame
game two weeks ago, Lieutenant
Wilson has been drilling his charges
overtime to show up the Kiltie band
at the Pitt-Tech fracas tomorrow af-
ternoon. The increasing importance
of these annual battles for thelcity
gridiron title has brought about
competition not only in the football
game itself but in the cheering sec-
tions and band formations.

The Pitt cadets will go to the
game tomorrow equipped with spe-
cially prepared song sheets. The
department has made much lament
on the ignorance of the Pitt sec-
tions in the way of songs and are
attempting to plug this gap.

Lieutenant Wilson was reluctant
to reveal any of the secrets of the
battalion’s drills although ‘he did
admit that the band will form
TECH even better than the Kiltﬁe
boys. The Lieutenant hasn’t for-
gotten theunfavorable comment on
the band’s work which followed last
year’s Pitt-Ohio State game.

The entire battalion -will march
behind the Pitt band in the parade
through the downtown section this
afternoon.

Olive Borden, In Interview,

Finds Pittsburgh Folks
Marathon Party-Goers

By LORETTA McCAULEY
Are Pittsburgh people marathon
party-goers or is Olive 'Borden
wrong? “I never saw people with

so much vitality, people who could

Stay out one night after another;
they just never sleep,” said Ollie.

She’s only twenty-two, you know,
and has lots of pep, and sparkle and
the most beautiful ﬁgure you or I
ever saw.

Somehow we’re always wondering‘

just how people break into the
movies and somehow we never do
ﬁnd out, but Olive tells us how she
did it. She went to Mt. St. Agnes
convent school in Mt. Washington,
Md., where she met the, Francis X.
Bushman children. They put the
movie-bug in her ear, she tells us.
And so far, far into the movies.

Olive_ told me that she spends a
good bit of time around California
on the various campuses, but that
isn't hard to understand. And after
an hour’s quizzing in her dressing
room, she said: “And don’t you for-
get to tell the kids on your campus
that I wish I could spend at least a
week more here so that I could
squeeze a nice long visit with Pitt
people.”

the future they expect better and
more interesting programs.

Mr. Staples, from the engineer-
ing department of Westinghouse,

Dignity Aside At Masque

 

By LOUISE Conn
The only costume not worn at the
annual faculty masque ball in the
ballroom of the Faculty Club last
Saturday evening, at which 45 cou-

ples were present, _was the one rep-
resenting the typical college P,1'°‘
fessor. Dignity, reserve, gravity;
austerity—-all were left behind . in
the dark, dusty _sch_ool room. In
their place, sociability, laughter,
music, dancing reigned.

As the guests arrived they were
given a piece of a postcard on which
a number was written. After the
grand march, these numbers were
used to create sociabil1_ty——the hold-
ers of the matching pieces of card
being partners for the next dance.

The ballroom was decorated in the
usual Halloween colors of black and
orange. The walls were ﬁttingly
decorated with witches and goblins
all concealing a number. As the
couples danced past they took a ﬁg-
ure from the wall. At the end of
the dance the couple holding the
largest sum won the contest. This
was called the number contest
dance.

Elimination Dance

Another novel dance was the
elimination dance. As the couples
danced, the numbers they held were
called out. The last couple on the
ﬂoor won the prize. This couple
gave a solo dance.

The grand march was led by Mr.

and Mrs. Van Sickle. Mr. Van
Sickle, who was the chairman ‘of
the entertainment committee, was
resplendently dressed as a parson.
Mrs. Van Sickle was a treat, dressed
in a wedding dress over a hundred
years old.
/ The loveliest prize for the ladies’
costume present was won by Miss
Mathews of the Advanced Standing
Department. She was dressed as a
Turkish lady. Mr. Walker, of the
Political Science Department, cut
up as Peck’s Bad Boy.

Refreshments were served at _11
o’clock. Everyone made merry with
cider and doughnuts.

Music was furnished by the Red
Peppers’ Orchestra.

Books, Gossips, Bookworms -

All Congregate In Library

By J. D. PAULUS

By the same strange coincidence
that has given us farm relief, gang
wars, freshman customs and poor
relations this scri-bbler accidently
on purpose entered the “sanctum
sanctorum” of the State Hall Li-
brary. Much has been said, both
good and otherwise, about the State
Hall recluse for those who are here

for study. We might add here that

nothing different from any other
library was noticed. except, perhaps,
the presence of books There are
so many books in the library that

there is hardly enough room for_us '

students.
There is hardly anything we

wouldn't do for our alma mater but '

to attempt to study (or even read
“Treasure Island”) in the place
would be placing too high a pre-
mium on our intellectual powers as
students. The library is the Mecca
of all the bookworms of the campus
and even some of those who do not
belong to the university being medi-
cal students, football players and
Weekly writers.

At any rate we entered the sacred
portals and proceeded to the desk
under the eyes of everyone in the
place, except the girl in charge. She
has seen such a great collection of
specimens of the genus homo sapiens
ﬁle past that just another one
wouldn't even raise an eyebrow. She
got us the book we asked for and
we set out to ﬁnd a seat.

Premium on Seats

Finding a seat’ in that Library is
like ﬁnding an oasis in the Sahara
desert. They’re few and far be-
tween. Finally a handsome young
chap (must have been a football
player) offered us a broken down
chair. He said he was through
studying but we were just quick
enough to see him stick a copy of
“The Specialist” in his brief-case.

books of some of the Gainmasigina
Alphas and others less or more im-
portant. There was no telling when
he ‘would be pledged and ﬁnd him-
self ‘scrubbing’ the frat house floor
or_ ironing a. brother’s only dress

.-;-The center of attraction in the
whole place was a young fellow

studying. .He was the only one in ‘

the whole place (page Dixmont)
who was really studying. What with
scurrying bookworms, nosey snoop-
ers, and Gabble Gossip Club meet-
ings going on he would try to study.
The whole scene seemed to swim
about our ears as the fellow sitting

next to us mumbled in a monotone ’

the choice passages from Francois
Arouet (Voltaire, to you). The
whole library began to swim, dive
and otherwis-e go into convulsion
with a period of dull stillness fol-
lowing. Suddenly a young, bespec-
tacled lady -touched our shoulder
and said, “It’s closing time, please.”
You see, we had fallen asleep.

Chancellor John G. Bowman will
speak at the annual freshman par-
ents’ reception, Friday, November
21, at Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Me-
morial Hall. Only the parents of
the freshmen and the faculty mem-
bers will attend. ~

“The purpose of this reception,”
Dean Robert C. Clothier, chairman
of the committee, states, “is to
have the parents meet the faculty in
order to enlist their counsel in guid-
ing and encouraging the students
most understandingly in their
work." For this reason, and for the
reason that the faculty members
may speak with more frankness, the
freshmen are not invited to attend.

No deﬁnite program has been ar-
ranged for the reception, but the
general plan is: the receiving line,

- a general talk by Chancellor Bow-

man, a speech by Dean ,Clothier,
the distribution of the report cards
to the parents, and interviews with
faculty members and advisers.

Committee
The members of the committee
are: Dean Clothier, chairman;

Dean Thyrsa W. Amos, Mr. A. H.
counselor In
the school of education; Mr. T. W.
Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men; Mr. R. »N. Dean, assistant pro-
fessor of ﬁnance; Mrs. E. F. Holt,
assistant to thedean of the school
of education; Mr. O. C. Held, per-
sonnel assistant to the dean of the
college; Mr. W. B. Jones, research
professor of education; Mr. J. G.
Quick, registrar; Miss Helen P.

Association Elects

Johnson Secretary .

 

At the annual board meeting in
New York of the American Eugenie
Association, Professor Roswell John-
son was re-elected secretary. Dur-
ing the last week he has also at-
tended a board meeting of the Penn-
sylvania Birth Control Association
and a- meeting of the Legislative
committee of the Public Charities
Association. Professor Johnson has
also been actively engaged in mak-
ini a number- of. speeches recently.

as-t Saturday, November 1, he
spoke to the members of the Tau
Delta Phi, a Tech fraternity, about
the “Control of Human Evolution.”
On Sunday,'November 2, he assisted
Pastor John Ray Ewers at the East
End Christian Church to answer
questions about the new “Russia.”
Yesterday he spoke to the Clairton
Women's Club about “Marriage.”
Tomorrow at 1:30 p. ’m., he will
speak to the American Association
of Women at the Women’s City Club
roomon “The New Russia.”

N the ﬂoors of showers and

little ringworm parasite that
causes "Athlete’s Foot” is right
at home. Tinea trichopliyton is
the name, and in colleges as far

vania it has been found that
50% of the men have it. Again,
the U. S. Public Health Service
reports that "at least half of
all adults suffer from it at
some time.”

"Athlete's Foot,” golfer’s
foot, toe itch, dobie-itch—‘thero

thing, and the symptoms are
redness between the toes, with

signals vary, but authorities
agree that they are all trace-

  They shut the door on hybrid styles

Quantity production of equipment has long
been practiced by the telephone industry.
Telephone designers years ago shut the door
on many hybrid styles-—sceking ﬁrst to work
out instruments which could best transmit the

voice, then making these few
. quantities.

This standardization made possible concen-
trated study of manufacturing processes, and

types in great‘

steady improvement of them. For example, the it
production of 15,000,000 switchboard lamps a
year, all of one type, led to the development
of a. highly special machine which does in a
few minutes what once took an hour. '
Manufacturing engineers, with their early

start in applying these ideas, have been able to

develop methods which in many cases have be’-
come industrial models. The opportunity is there!

Rushing The F rash

been thrown into the whirlpool of fraternity rushing. For
. a week he will be subjected to a barrage of social-events.
Then come seven days of silence when he must make a deci-
 At the end of that time he determines whether he shall
fiﬁiliate with any fraternal group, and if so, the more serious
fquestlon of what group it shall be.
f  It is a serious problem; one in which many freshmen will
 st be overwhelmed by their own inexperience and the
 _ -tinted arguments advanced by “brothers in the bond.”
yr-‘.Any fair: discussion of ' the fraternities at Pitt must. take

 uni: of two aspects of the question. One is general and has
.. I  with a fundamental hunger for the kind of companion-
 a fraternity offers. The other depends on conditions per-
thinning to" each individual fraternity in the University.
91¢ V Does the freshman know that the advantages of a good
 jternity to its members and to the school of which it is a
 may be unquestionably ﬁne? Is he also aware that there,
t5so°,,'are grave dangers in the path of the fraternity system?
‘H '_ ‘Friendship, conﬁdence and loyalty are probably the ab-
:.gtrsct.,virtues gained from fraternity membership. There is
A doubt that in many cases the fraternity does contribute to
"members a richness of experience that nothing else has ever
ven them. But more should probably be said of fraternity
 dvantages. The rushee will be ﬁlled with bursts of enthu-
 on their merits! ,

.;_ For boys of an easy-going temperament a fraternity is
ﬁlrely to be a great menace. Its congenial atmosphere is apt
 remove all concern of time which he will let slip through
<  ﬁngers. The possible tendency for fraternities to form
cliques, the danger of inside dissensions, occasioned by men
 before they have an opportunity to'be certain that the
ljrgimup will be a congenialone, and the ﬁnancial obligations as-
gumed with fraternity membership are some of the less fa-
.,_vorable aspects which the rushees should consider.

  The whole question to the freshman is an evaluation of
yhlmself to determine whether, to him, the fraternity would
 liability or an asset. In a week of mad rushing when ev-
""ery‘ho_use is on its “good behavior" he must come. to some
I “sort of .1 decision. He will be made fully acquainted with the
advantages! That is why some of the “rust” that clings to

  Back To The Parade

 HAS BEEN TWO YEARS since Pitt has staged a Carnegie

 

 

3;,‘ ‘ Tech pep parade! Last year the pep celebration resulted in
  an unsuccessful attempt to establish a new custom in the
  of a bonﬁre cheering session. Now they have wisely
  back to the parade and returnedto Pitt one of those few

kfyvionest-to-goodness traditions for which Student Council has
 lookingduring the past few months.
A As a tradition on the campus, the parade will, it is hoped,
eiiect the true spirit of the University and the,student body.
Thousands of persons in downtown Pittsburgh will have an
{ﬂéportunity to witness Pitt spirit.

” And here is the place to sound a note of caution! Let's
‘not make the celebration act as a boomerang, giving residents
{of the district a false opinion of the University student body.
;i'l'he way to do this is to keep the enthusiasm within bounds
 leave rowdyism out of the demonstration. ‘With capable
ffeaders, adequate preparations and sane thinking student body,
''there should be little danger of this.
 _ Let the memory those, who view the parade, hold of Pitt
‘traditions be one worthy of the University!

Sophisticated Men Know
Best Fraternities

By J. ERNEST WRIGHT.
Instructor in English

The unintelligent man who has
never “made a fraternity” ends his
four years at college feeling that he
has never really been there. He
feels that a fraternity is the be—all
and end-all‘ of university careers. He
is not aware that many of the ﬁnest
men in his university or some in-
dividual who is to be the scientist or
the novelist of his age, has never
seen the inside of a fraternity house.
His ideas of what a fraternity is are
the same as those of the worst type
that belongs to a fraternity.

But there are other men who do
or do not belong to these groups
who do not know what fraternities
are.“ At least they know what a fra-
ternity, aims to be, or what it should
be. And when all is said and done a
fraternity is as successful and ad-
mirable an organization as any
other. No group is foolproof, be at
a family, a church, a university class
in physics, or a, business concern.

a s o

The sophisticated man, the fellow
who has been around and has made
up his own mind, knows what the
best fraternities are. And anything
should be judged by its best exam-

The new sidewalk bordorin the

as a blind end. The long-suffering
pedestrians still have to walk on the
drive to get to Alumni Hall, begin-
ning a short distance below the
curve. ‘Meandering their crooked, tor-
turous way from one indeﬁnite. oint
on the campus to another, the at-
en paths are interesting new trails
to follow sometimes. You never
know exactly vzhege you will land.

cracks through which the spy may
peer upon gr1d.1roI1’1 secrets.

Names are deceiving. The Chem-

Wright Story to Aid Rushees

In this issue, Mr. J. Ernest Wright, instructor in English, dis-
cusses men's social fraternities, outlimn

 

vantage and opportunities of membership in the organizations and
presenting his own personal 0 inion of their worth from many
angles. The article is particular y appropriate because of the rush-
ing season which is now in progress.

Next week, Robert C. Clothier, dean of men, will present his

' g a cross-section of ad-

particularly as it pertains to the

ples, not its worst. Further, any
man who is a rushee, any man who
is rushing another knows that
among ﬁfteen or more organizations
on a campus the rushee has the
chance to choose that one with which
he is going to throw his lot. Let him
choose that group that achieves the
best standards, the maturest qual-
itys ' ;’
And what is the best standard?
Well, a real fraternity will be a real
man’s club, with aims and ideas and
demands that any adult English hr
American man’s club will stand back
of. It will be a meeting place for
men who are congenial in habit,
thought, dress, manner, physical or
mental or professional equipment.

Has Practice

Race For Positions Tightens
As More Are Eliminated

 

Yesterday's meeting of -the Men's
Debating Association, at which time
a symposium on the debate ques-
tion of “Unemployment Insurance”
was l.e1d, marked the second stage

in a series of eliminations within
the squad for positions on the de-
bating teams which will represent
the University in the forthcoming
forensic contests.

Each member of the squad pre-
pared and submitted a brief on the
question, “Resolved: That the Sev-
eral Ttates Should Enact Legisla-
ture Providing for Compulsory Un-
employment Insurance.” Together
with this a scheduled trial debate
was held between four picked men of
the. squad. L. J. Butler, Col. '32 and
Jess Spirer, Col. '31 defended the
affirmative side of the question,
while Sam Strauss, Col. '31, and
Emanuel Fishkin, Col. '31, presented
the negative argument.

Meet Thursdays A

These meetings of the Debating
Association are held every Thurs-
day at 12:30 o'clock, in room 217
Alumni Hall, in order to acquaint

every possible angle of verbal at-
tack that might be advanced against
either side of the chosen questions
in subsequent debates.

Edward T. Crowder, student man-
ager of the debaters, is now engaged
in the work of arranging the sched-
ule of intercollegiate and extension

wants to avoid them. He detests

Talk Given On
Brazil Revolt

 

Brazilian Difficulties

At an open meeting of students in
the Heinz House, Wednesday after-
noon, Antonio Albuquerque, Col. ’33,
a native of Brazil, gave an informal
talk on the “Political Situation in
South America.”

Albuquerque, whose home is the
seaport town of Recife, in the state
of Pernambuco, is in a position to
kno" the true cause and the re-
sultant effects of the series of revo-
lutionary disturbances which have
taken place in the United States. of
Brazil since last February.

“The cause of the three revolts
whichhave occurred in my country,”
stated Albuquerque in his address,
“are deﬁnitely economic. The dro
in the .price of sugar which too
place early this year, brought on
the first uprising. A later cut in the

price of tea exported from Brazil‘

resulted in a second disturbance.
The third revolt of last August was
brought on by the diminished budget
plan of the government then in

power.”
Lots of Sugar

Albuquerque had a chance to ob-
serve conditions as they were this
summer while on a visit home. His
father, a. prominent business man
of Recife, owns extensive sugar.
plantations, and reﬁneries, besides
being engaged in the exporting of
the product. The growing and reﬁn-
ing of sugar came, with the possible
exception of the great coffee output,
is the most extensive industry car-
ried on in Brazil, Albuquerque ex-
plained.

In closing, he expressed the wish
that his country would attain politi-
cal stability, saying that some kind
of a centralized government wasthe

game, but lost in a stimulating ex-
change of talk.

# t O

This is the type that takes all the
sham mystic rites with undue seri-
ousness, that thinks the very word
fraternity should be uttered on the
campus with bated breath, that be-
lieves all pledges should be made
fools of until they are ‘‘brothers.’'
Such an attitude is an Amos an’
Andy attitude!

If a man's individuality can be
buried in a group, it isn't very live.
_It won't contribute much to his fam-
ll)’, his friends, his fraternity, or to
himself. The man with deﬁnite per-
sonality will lead. He is the man who
is bid, the man who shouldbe bid.
He may not be first in every ﬁeld.
No one ever has been. But he can
be a man of ‘awareness, of precep-
tion in many ﬁelds. ’

And a real fraternity is a club of
such_men, men who _can talk about
Hamiltonian formulae at a dance
and about Angel Pavement at a
smoker; men who can tolerate queer
taste in neckties in a fellow who
plays Beethoven, or who can hold
a_tennis championship and also grow
highly specialized roses. ‘

of gentle comedy. _ Miss Gish and

Dambach Gives Talk,
On Modern Phys. Ed.

-Professor ‘Charles Dambach, head
of the department of physical edu-
catlon, spoke last week at the Teach-
er's . Institute. of Fayette county
meeting on the subject-of “Modern-
izing the Physical. Education of Our
School Systems." Dr. Dambach ex-
plained the new system started at
Pitt this semester. ,

During the convention, the Pitt
educator held conferences with the
i_:eachers_of the primary schools, the
Junior high schools, the senior high
schools and the rural schools.

At present, Mr. Dambach is en-
gaged by the school board of Mon-
essen, Pa., to make a survey of the
physical recreation situation in that
locality. _ s far he has been
there twice and will return to Mon-
essen on November 19. The main
idea of this extensive survey is to
show the su rintendent of schools
how tospen money for the better-
ment of physical recreation pro-
grams.

The department announces that
the lnterfraternity horseshoe tourna-
ment will start November 18. Last
year's rules will govern the compe-

, Let us not allow -the tradition of free minds to perish.-—
Remy de Gourmont. '

My Thirty Years War (Margaret Anderson) is a record
of the refusal of one free mind to perish in the war with medi- 
ocrity. To this American woman, descendant of Scotch ances- 
tors. reahty was synonymous with mediocrity. And, as she be- 
gins her book by saying, her greatest enemy was reality. She
fought it successfully for thirty years, in her family, in busi-
ness men, 111 poetasters, in talkers, in all of the arts.

No more brilliant battle against cant of every form has
ever been wasted than is waged in this book. The style is as
rapid and staccato as machine-gun ﬁre. Few books say so
muchto the page as Mil Th57't3I Years War. Few books devas-
tate so much ground with a single gesture.

As most of Miss Anderson's thirty years war was carried
on in the various arts, its organ was the magazine she started
in Chicago in 1914. Jane Heap finished it in New York ﬁf-
teen years later, after a partnership that for brilliance and 
bravery has never been surpassed. 

t\__ .
W1!

? I should say one who is used to

 

\

as:

A sophisticated person
being a human being.

In spite of Miss Anderson's statement: I have never felt-
much like a human being. It's a .glorious feeling she spent the
thirty years recorded by living like the highest type of hu-
man being, as no doubt she would admit... One of the beauties
of the book is the new meaning it gives to words and phrases of
this kind. _She takes old worn coins, polishes them to their
original brightness and value and puts them into circulation
again. "

The book contains brief, sharp records of the artists whose
work the Little Revie-w published during its militant ﬁfteen
years: Brancusi, Ezra Pound, Amy Lowell, Djuna Barnes,
Jean Cocteau, the extraordinary Baroness Else von Freytag
von Loringhoven, and the author of the literary masterpiece
of the generation. James Joyce. It was in the Little Review
that Ulysses was ﬁrst printed until Mr. Sumner and his crowd
conﬁscated three issues.

II
VI

Good Writing never springs from snobbery; good dressing
from little else.—M.C.A.

That.Miss Anderson was a thoroughly high type of human _
being is shown in her record of her meetings and talks with
Sumner, and the generosity with which she grants _him his own
quality of intelligence and.geniality‘and conscience. One is re-
minded of D. H. Lawrence's respect for his own dark gods and
those of other men.

That both Miss Anderson and Jane Heap were free minds
is further shown by their assent to the ﬁnest manifestations
in the arts. They were nomere idol breakers; they were
worshipers of the ‘true gods. And it seems that they could
do what Moses could not do-—look on the faces of the gods
and live. ' . ’

The three bom'ng'Ba.rrymorés;

This book should be. read ‘by every one interested in the
processes. of the creative mind, the ps chology of the artist. It .
will throw as much light as Cabell’s tmws and Prayerbooks
and Beyond Life, and much more- Itlmakes clear as much of
those processes as does Henry Adams’ Mont Saint Michel and
Chartres. The discussions of Harold Bauers’ playing, of Mary
Gard_en’s singing and acting will destroy a lot of cant about
those things. i '

Parkinson " Gives Pi t t
Edge_In Backﬁeld,

Line Tomorrow

By ED PECK

Tom Parkinson, 1929 all-Ameri-
can fullback for Pitt, predicted a
victory for Pitt over Carnegie Tech
next Saturday while he was watch-
ing the team work out Monday af-
ternoon, November 3. He_ has played
for Pitt against Tech in each’ of
the lat three engagements and has
also seen the Techites perform this
year. His words are, “I believe Pitt
will take Carnegie Tech.” When
asked by how many touchdowns Pitt
would win, Tom laughed and said,
“That depends. .

“There is only one man in the.
Tech backﬁeld that Pitt will have to
watch,” is his stated opinion of the
Tartans highly-touted backﬁeld.
Tom does not believe that the Tar-
tans backﬁeld is superior to that of
the Panthers. “Eyth is fast and
‘slippery and will need plenty of
watching,” is another of his state-
ments. About Karcis, the Tartans’
human dynamo, who Tom, himself,
played against twice, he said, "Kar-
cis is a ﬁne defensive man but he
never did anything against Pitt.
Just look back to the wayhe folded
up last year. ~

Pitt Line Strong .

“Pitt's line has always stood up

very well before Tech and should

give. a good account of itself next

aturday,” is his idea of the out-
come of the struggle between the
two lines. He thinks that the Pan-
thers have a line sufficiently im-
tpgoved to outrush that of the Tar-

nsl .

Parkinson’s whole attitude showed
very plainly that he believes that
the Panthers will snap out of. their
state of dilemma and take the Tar-
tans into camp Saturday. When
asked about the possibilities of Tech
using their aerial attack to get by
Pitt, he replied, “Pitt’s aerial de-
fense is much better than that of
last year and look what happened.”

When he was asked how he
thou ht the last year Pitt team
woul have done against Notre
Dame, he replied: “It would have
been a real football game. I wish
I could have played against Notre
Dame." Well, there are plenty of
Pitt students who wish he would
would have been able to, too.

‘Strong Yearling Club Beats
Mountaineers, 7-6

 

 

 

A great little battle is forecast
for next Tuesday afternoon, Armis-
tice Day, when the Panther Plebes
tussle with the Kiski Preps at
Johnstown. On paper the Pitt
freshmen hold an edge with vic-
tories over the George Washington
and West Virginia Yearlings and a
scoreless tie. with the Carnegie Tech
Frosh. Kiski, however, has tasted
defeat twice this season, having lost
to~the Washington and J eiferson and
Carnegie Tech Plebes. This cannot
be taken lightly for last week the
Saltsburg gridmen rode rough shod
over the Penn freshmen to pile up
a 32-0 score. ,

Chalky Williamson, head mentor
and former Pitt all-American quar-
terback, with the able assistance of
Advisory Coach Jim Marks, has pro-
duced _one of the strongest prep
teams In the country at Kiski this
year. Some of . the boys who are
outst_and1ng_f0r the Kiski Preps are
Kadlic, a triple threat uarterback;
Wetzel and Brinkley, ful backs; Kal-
baugh, guard, and Spiac, a halfback.

Frosh Look Good

Love, Onder, Meredith and Sklad-
any have been showing up well on
the hue for the Pitt Fresh, while
I-Iogan_ Simms and Matesic have
been giving a good account of them-
selves in the backﬁeld.

Coach “Skip” Gougler turned his
Panther Cubs loose on the West
Virginia Plebes at Morgantown last
Saturday afternoon and the Year-
hngs came through with a well de-
served 7-6 victory. “Shanty” Ho-
8‘an’s perfect placement kick after
touchdown provided the winning
margin. '

. Defeat West Virginia

The ﬁrst half was all in favor of
Coach Gougler’s proteges. Early in
the opening quarter, Quarterback
H089-n punted deep into Mountain-
eer territory. Mazzei, W. Va. half-
bijlcko fumbled on the ﬁrst play and
tt recovered on the W. Va. 15-
yard line. Three line plays gained
httle; S0 Matesic stepped back and
hurled one of his port side spirals
to_ Hogan who crossed the Moun-
taineer goal unmolested. Hogan
also negotiated the extra point.

Another touchdown looked inevi-
table as the.second period got under
way. Starting from their own 20-
yard marker, the Pitt Plebes
marched to the  Va. 10, but here,

Over-Rated Teams A Clash

In Stadium Tomorrow

(Continued from Page One)

U, a team which should have been
satisﬁed to hold the Tartans to a
two-touchdown margin of victory,
walked off the ﬁeld after the game

with the Tartans with a 20-7 vic-

tory to their credit.

To add to the dilemma of the Car-
negie situation, dissension within
the ranks of the players has been
rife following their unexpected de-
feat at the hands of the Violets.
Harry McCurdy, regular quarter-
back, has quit the squad, accord-
ing to reports of snooper number
one.

“I-Iymie” Gold-berg, second string
quarterback, will be unable to take
over the reins at the signalcalling
post, due to scholastic difficulties, a
fact which leaves the team in
charge of Dueger, _a third string
mani ;'

While Dueger played a good game
last week after relieving McCurdy,
he will not do as ood this week as
last week,_ as he nows that much
of Carnegie’s hopes rest with him.
Last week,_ he entered the game free
from worries, but a week of tension
will do him no_ good, especiallyrwhen
the game carries the traditional im-
portance that the Pitt-Carnegie
game does.

Pitt, on the other hand,‘ will en-

ter the game in the bestof condi-

tion. All the cripples are in good
shape and the boys will have the
added incentive to win, as they
know that a victory will assure the
season being a success.

Pitt's only worries in this game
will be to ﬁnd a means of stopping
the end runs of “Dutch” Eyth, the
only_ Tartan back who has been a
consistent ground gainer this year.
Pitt s _ends have been notoriously
weak in stopping end runs in the
past two games and if they fail to
_stop Eyth tomorrow, Pitt may be
in for a. beating.

Eyth, a little fellow, however, has
been subject to much punishment
this year and he is bound to slow
up some time. He may do so this
week for though the Pitt ends may
not tackle him‘ often, they will
tackle him hard whenever they
break through the Tech interfer-
ence_, and big boys like MacMurdo,
Collins and Hirshberg are big
011013811 to give any man punish-
ment. .

Carnegie, to make matters even,
has a bigger weakness than the Pan-
thers in that they are unable to

‘frustrate’ the aerial attacks of their
opponents and Pitt gained heavily
in this department against the
Cornhuskers last week. A

Pitt’s aerial attack and Reider’s
ability to shake himself loose on his
jaunts around left end will be more
than enough to insure a victory for
the Panthers. 

A prediction as to the ﬁnal score,
of agame coming from me, appar-
ently does not carry much weight
around the University since I_ pre-
dicted that Pitt would beat Notre
Dame 21-0, and the editor received
a letter this week from an irate
reader of my junk, asking, or rath-
er, demanding in resignation, as he:
had lost ﬁve dol ars betting on my
predictions.

Perhaps,‘ I have been too liberal
in the past two weeks in predictin
the Pitt total in their games wit
Notre Dame and Nebraska, so this
week I will be conservative ~ for 1..-e.
change. “

Pitt will win tomorrow, 16-6. The
freshman football team will beat
Kiski 13-0. And the varsity cross-
country team will win its second
meet of ‘the year from Carnegie
Tech, 23-32. The freshman. cross-
country team» will beat the Tartan
plebes 17-38. My cross-country
prediction last week was perfect. -

Still suffering from the rout b
Notre Dame, the Panther footbaﬁ

dohnstown Parents

Johnstown Center. -— Chancellor
Bowman’s annual reception for the
parents of Johnstown Center stu-
dents, will take place on November
13' in the Johnstown Hi h School
gymnasium.‘ Dr. Cra ord is in
charge of all arrangements for the
aifair, The main feature will be an
address by the Chancellor, following
whichnluslcal entertainment and re-
freshments will‘ be provided.

 

 

An undercurrent of excitement
prevails here and the whole place
seethes. -The res nsibility lies with
the Freshman c ass‘ who have re-
fused toobey customs. Res ctive
'.cl,ass-meetings‘ have been h d and
cries of “organization” fill the halls.

The Sophs threaten 9. mighty tam-
ing-down process and vow that the
crack of paddle a ainst pants‘ will
resound t rough. e corridors. All
the excitement will culminate in the
Fresh-Soph football game on No-
vember _11. _ . . '

The highlight of the early winter
social season. will be the Thanksgiv-
ing dance, November 28, sponsored
by the Panther Cub, the local Cen-
ter's newspaper. Cleon Wingard, cir-
culation manager of the Cub, is gen-
eral chairman. Piper’s Pied Pipers,
an orchestra directed by a local stu-
dent, has been engaged for the oc-
casion. Many novelities and a variety
of entertainment are promised.

McClenahan I Heads‘
_" Local Hockey Club

iA Pittsburgh Field Hocke Club
has been organized this fal , with
Miss Margaret McClenahan as res-
ident. All women interest in
hockey, who are not school students,
are eligible for membership. The
club meets every Saturday morning
and plays ‘hockey from 9:30 to 11
on the Universit ﬁeld. ‘

Miss Janes, a s illful hockey play-
er from Scotland, accepted the po-
sition of coach forvtheclub last Sat-
urday.

The ambition of the group is to
represent Pittsburgh in inter-city
hockey games. The club is not yet
eligible for the National Hockey As-
sociation, but when three teams are
organized in the city they will join
the league.

Miss McClenahan has written to
western teams and asked them to
stop on their way East to play.
There is a great ossibility that the
Philadelphia clu will come to
Pittsburgh and play the local team
Saturday morning in the near fu-

~ ture.

225 Students Turn
Election Reporters

Approximately 225 Pitt students

 

turned’ reporters last Tuesday night ’

when they reported the election re-
turns to The Pittsburgh Press. Each
student was assigned to a. polling

place near his home and after the

gubernatorial and senatorial ballots
were counted the student telephoned
the results to the newspaper.

Some of the less fortunate stu-
dents had to ride miles or trudge
over muddy roads to reach their as-
signed districts. Some of the more
fortunate sat in warm schoolhouses,
while the most fortunate of the neo-
phyte reporters had refreshments
while the ballots were counted.

Weekly sports department. Every
Friday at ten-thirty you will get the
"dope" on the Pitt gridders through
this station.

Those Cornliuskers were plenty
tough last Saturday, and held us to
a a game. You know those boys

ing things.

" ‘ Almost In Game

Well, folks, you missed the chance
of seeing me on the playing field
Saturda . “Jock" had sent me on
to the eld when we were on the
one-foot line to push over a touch-
down. When I went to report the
referee. said, ~“what are ou. doing
out here, when you were p aying‘ for
leads
and argued with him that ‘ ye had
mistaken m‘e for somebody else but
he couldn’.t seeit that way, an or-
dered me off the laying ﬁeld. I
went‘ of!’ after be t restencd to pc-
nalize us half the distance to the
goal line, but I told him. that I’d
see him afterthe ame. After the
game, me and “Joe ” went over to
see him. g“Jock” wanted to see

I

‘ that I didnt get in a fight.) The

“ref,” after looking me over two or
three times, admitted that he had
made a mistake and that he was
sorry. Not wanting to take any
credit awa from the .great_ defense
of the Nebraska line, I know that
we'd have won if it wasn't for the
“boner” pulled by the referee.

Since that game is all over, me
and “Jock” have been worrying all
week‘ about the Carnegie Techlganie.
“Jock" ‘was telling inc that he
doesn’t like to beat them as they
are brother ,Scotchmen,' but‘ you
have to take the

bad in this word. Tech took. an

‘awful licking last Saturday. Now

they're burning mad to take us over.

So we will have to play the best

game that we are capable of to get

the “bacon.” ’
“Wins”_ Bet

I haven't been telling you folks
anything that goes’ on in the dress-
ing room before we-go out to prac-
tice each afternoon. But I’m going
to tell you a. little joke that I pulled
on the boys yesterday. I was say-
ing‘ that Tech ought to “ beat us if
past performances‘ mean anything
as we lost’. two games and tied one
this car while Tech only lost two
and, idn'_t tie a single game. Then
the be s all yelled at one time that
we h i only lost one game this year.
Just to prove that they were wrong,
I made "each one a wager of a dime
with Bud Moore, the. trainer, ‘hold-
ing. stakes. Then whenvl told them
that Pitt had lost to Southern«Cal-
ifornia on New Year's’-Day,.did they
get sore? They mobbed “Bud,” and
besides getting their own money,
they took mine. So if you folks use
my little trick, don't forget to send
me a little of your winnings. Al-
ways be sure you make your bet
willéh somebody smaller than your-

e . i . . , I

There wasn't any of you students
at Nebraska, but_I want to see you
at Ohio State a. week from. tomor-
row and go by bus, as‘I get a little
“cut” from the, transportation ‘com-
pany for mentioning it in my col-
umn. A I am Sub-Station B-E-N-C-H

When the University of Pitts-

morning, another test in the rivalry
between the two local schools will
begin. _ ‘ ,

Pitt a. llight edge over the land
runners, basing its prediction on the
individual time of the runners on
both teams and the fact that Pitt
has been beaten‘-’ by several of the
stro st teams in the «East, while
Tech as lost to weaker teams. Pitt
won its first meet of the season by

d defeating Allegheny College and

then lost to Ohio State, Penn State
and Syracuse. Tech has beaten
Westminster and lost to Geneva and
New York University. ‘

Ca.ptain'Jess Price of Tech, has
run some fine races thi .
is generally slated for first place in
tomorrow’s meet. His time for the
Schenle course is 28:30, much
faster t an Clise or Caesar, of Pitt,
his closest rivals among the two
teams, have run the 5 3-8 miles
course. ; ‘
Caesar, Clise, Mazzei and Srnoyer
should take the next four places for
Pitt, leavin sixth, seventh, eighth
and 3. possi le ninth for Tech.
is generally. conceded that the Tech
aggregation is not well enough bal-
anced to score’ a victory over Coach
Shoals team. iWith probable first,
sixthyi seventh eighth and tenth
places, it would be impossible. for
the .Scotchmenvto‘ carry off all the-
honors for a winning score. .

The. purple head-geared cheering
on that appeared at the Notre
Danie game-—that compact, enthu-
siastic grou of Dents—-will again
turn out wi their purple hats for
the Tech me. This decision was
made by t e Dental student council
i view of the ﬁne initial appearance
ey made.

The sensation the purple hats
created at the Notre Dame game is
not unusual, the Dents bein known
for their stron and spiri organ-
ization. Ted using, popular sports
announcer for the Columbia Broad-
casting System, several times called
his listeners’ attention to the hats.

Over Coed

Now that hockey season has
opened for the girls, football play-
ers are starting to raise a kick.
That is what a football player
should raise providing it's with a
football on the other end of it and
not poor little feminine hockey
plalyers.

he cause of. all the squabble, con-
fusion and what have you, is the

 

original lineup used by these un-

scrupulous girls. It’s not on the
ﬁeld, mind you, but in a row along
the fence. Instead of calling plays
or signals the call out remarks
about our blus ing heroes of the
gridiron as they pass by. Chuck
Tully, much to his disgust, cannot
refrain from smiling coyly as he
passes his feminine admirers and
thus shows off the wide open
spaces where certain teeth used ‘to
be. Franklin Hood objects to the
praise hurled at his scoring ability
in front of the sophomore members
of the team. Heller, the sophomore

scientiﬁc tete-a-tete was interrupted
by a gentleman who came in to in-
quire of Mr. Dambach whether or
not Orange six saturated should be
used for a certain experiment. Mr.
Dambach answered negatively, sug-
gested the proper solution, and the
gentleman retired to a little labora-
tory to the side of the main room.
No sooner had he left when Dr.
Williams came in and wanted to
know about something or other and,
of course, Mr. Danibach obl' ed
with the answer. In addition to

ing nurseinaid to" protozoans, eels
and skeletons,,our friend Mr. Dam-
bach proved an encyclopedia for the
department heads. here, there and

everywhere.
Chicks, Too .

We asked concerning hundreds of
boxes placed on about seven dirt
covered shelves and he replied that
they were slides, microscopic ‘slides,
showing everythin from the Fall
of Rome to the De eat of Harold at
Hastings. Really it didn’t, but we
couldn’t understand it anyhow. At

that a series of slides included in
the collection showed the complete
embryology of a chick. On the op-
posite shelf there are twelve or so
reels of ﬁlm which were actually
taken at the local laboratories. One
set of ﬁlm which is, as yet, unde-
veloped, was taken by Dr. Williams
of the Pitt department.
Now the oniinifera spun onoata,
or fulla bolonia or somet ing like
that, says Mr. Dambach, is exactly
what gives headaches to- students
and store room keepers alike. The
students, says Mr. Dambach, are
very thoughtful. Rarely if ever, are
gecimens ‘of an kind returned, to
e care of the idas of the Store-
room. Such species as the greatonia
letitia, lotta nonsensa and others
which ordinary college students
couldn’t understand are in the pet
collections of Mr. Dambach.

$3.50 Per Cat
Concerning the monetary expendi-
ture at the local laboratory Mr.
Dambach was reluctant to speak.
He did _confess, however, that em-
balmed cats (if you'd like to order
a dozen or so) run around three‘
dollars and ﬁfty cents each. Sharks,
on the other hand, set the storeroom
back something like ﬁfteen dollars a
dozen.» - e .
Asked whether or not he would
trade places with Mr. Dambach of
the Trees Gym, the local curator re-
plied: “No, my bugs are precious
to_ me. You can't realize how to
love a bug, what it means to be
with them until you've had the ex-
erience with them that I have had.”
0, thanking Mr. Dambach, we left

turbed amid his collections, bottles,

When vacation time rolls around.
Wanderlust seizes the hearts of some
of 'our.Pitt students, and they 1'8-
spond enthusiastically to its beckon-
ing. Some go by land, and some 80
by sea, but most of us stay at home.
This story, however, deals with two
of our popular globe-trotters, Herb
Dent and Marty Fallon.

.-Herb Dent, of the rotund ﬁgure
and genial personality, left Pitts-
burgh in July, 1329, with the good
intentions of “seeing America first.’
Two weeks later, Herb arrived in
Los Angeles, determined to learn
the movie business from the ground
up. Our next news of Herbert comes
from Culver City, Calif., where we
ﬁnd him busily engaged in the prop-
erty departments of the Metro-Gold-
wyn-Mayer, Hal Roach and_ Pathe
Studios. ,

"Los Angeles and Hollywood are
wonderful places,” observes Herb,
“for millionaires.” “As long as. you

with no pun intended. I couldn’t get
well acquainted with any of the
crew, because they were all Span-
iards, and I couldn’t speak their lin-
go. That’s why I’m studying Spanish
here this semester.”

At this stage of the story, Marty
stopped to tell us some fragments of
his life story. Girls, this tall, red-
headed subject of our story was
born in London, England, but at the
age of nine, he decided to make a
present of himself “in the ﬁes ” to
these United States. His sea journey
possibly inspired in him his deep
love of the sea, which he insists still
remains. He has alread sailed along
the Coasts of Centra and South
America--a real globe-trotter.

Likes “Moon”

Marty likes the weather in Hav-
ana and the Carribean moon, but
he had no girl friend along toshare
his enthusiasm. Just another case of
life’s little tragedies!

"‘I had to give up smoking,” sighed
Marty, "can you imagine‘! cigar-
ettes sold for as high as forty-ﬁve
cents! The one thing that Havana
and the States have in common, is
the taxi fare. They must have seen
me coming; they sure did soak me
.8.-plenty.”

Marty only remained in Havana
for a few days, because he had to
get back to New York with his ship,
the Orizoba. The round-trip. from
New York back to New York lasted
only ten days, but what a ten days!

Well, folks, Marty is back at Pitt,

conﬁding to his pals certain facts

that he wouldn't tell us. But he did
tell us, conﬁdentially, that, next
summer, he «hopes to board some
old, tramp steamer, and visit the
Far East.

And “alas,” sigh we, “we have to
spend our summers in Pittsburgh,
while others go places and do things.
What a life.”
