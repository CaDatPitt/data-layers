Where the club’s new quarters will

faculty organization, it is ‘said.’--'

The 600-room Presbyterian Eye‘

main building of the,_Medical -com

faculty club now stands. A
$6,000,000 campaign to ﬁnance‘ this
hospital and the nurses home, which‘
is to be opposite the completed
Children‘s' Hospital, has been begun.

_ PRACTICED HIS PROFESSION
In his early life, shortly after graduating in 1859 as 8. civil engineer

thereafter, he was engaged in the active practice of his profession, and
laid‘ out and constructed a number of‘ railways in Newlersey and ‘else-
where, but principally in New J_ers_ey.- If my memory isnot at fault he
surveyed and supervised the-* buildi-ng of the railroad from Monmouth

During he next ten "years he taught civil engineering" in the institu-
tion from which he had graduatedin Philadelphia, and then in. 1882 began
his long career as a teacher in Pittsburgh. _ M _

While he was a practical master of his profession he was above
everything else a TEACHER. ' Though he well knew how to lay out and
‘build a: railway,‘ he .1 found higher; delight in training other men how to
do the same kind of work; He had a ﬁrm grasp of all the principles which
are involvcdin the‘su'c‘c'essful‘_ prosecution of engineering work in every
department. He was 3- profound ma'them'atician. ’

and saidto him: “Your father is desirous that youvshould have an edu-

you; do you think- you are treating your father’ and’ me squarely?” My

with any member of the -faculty. He was universally respected and uni-

the University, I was able ‘to -absent myself for work on behalf of the in-
stitution, leaving, the supervision of the work of instruction in his hands,

“*2-“-‘J--“-‘»é’e‘l-‘ii?-"”iTliE PITT wEEKLY's ALUMNI PAGE

Dr. Daniel’ (“Uncle D’an”,)'Carhart, “Grand Old Man of the Engineering School,” loved by allthe engin-
eering alumni and student body, has passed to the Great Beyond. His death occurred Tuesdaynight, Decem-
bet 7, being due primarily to the effects of an accident October>25. _

“Uncle Dan’s” life had exte?n‘ded.far beyond the three, score years and ten limit. He was 87 years of age
and until of late had been,_in, splendid health. Recently his friends noticed he was failing. rapidly, this being
noted especially when he attended the last engineering luncheon at commencement time.

Funeral services "wet-eheld. in the First Presbyterian Church, Wilkinsburg, Friday, and were deeply impres-

give. The speakers were Dr. William J. Holland, Dr. S. B. McCormick and Chancellor John G. Bowman.

Dr.

Holland’s beautiful tribute to Dr. Carhart is printed elsewhere on this page.

As the secretary sat in the quiet‘ of the

' RECOLLECTIONS

2

Wilkinsburg church last Friday he thought ofsome of his own ex-

periences with “Uncle Dan”"in the days of old W. U. P., 20 years ago. In those days ‘there were three profes-
sors of long service much love'd'by the W. U. P. boys—-namely’ Dr. Carhart (familiarl‘y'known“ as “Uncle Dan”),
Dr. Albert Ellis Frost (known-‘as “Mother” Frost) and a little later, Dr. M. E. Wadsworth (known as “Pop-
py”). It was a great triumvirate. “Uncle Dan,” “Mother? and “Poppy” were -professors one never forgets.
As the years go by and weithinklof these men we realize that their inﬂuence had much to do with shaping
the careers of hundreds of studentswho sat at their feet. ‘

Dr. Carhart was the last of the three to be called by death. He had bee'n¢Professor Emeritus of Civil
Engineering’ since retiring and made it a point‘ to keep inpretty closetouch with the Engineering School un-
til ‘very recent years. "The engineers annually honored him at their engineering luncheon, at which time “Un-
cle Dan” produced his_ Vclassbook and called the roll of the “old boys” who attended the engineering school and

studied under him twenty or more years ago.

Far be it from the secretary to wish time to pass by (and he

can count sixteen now incalculating the intervening years. since he graduated) but: as we have attended these
luncheons we have looked.-forward to the day when “Uncle Dan”,would' call our name and honor us in his twen-
ty—year class. Apparently hole. and hearty, it seemed pretty sure he would» live to do-so.

AN UNUSUAL CHARACTER

“Uncle Dan” ,_was.4a‘5.cl§gii'3‘1:cter- such as‘. one-meets infrequentlyin a lifetime. When we started to old
W. U. P. in -1906,,someone‘ pointed out a professor whom we thoug'ht’at‘ﬂrst glance was a rather stern look-
ing individual and said " “'I‘here’s ‘Uncle Dan’ Carhart.” lie is a'“ﬁne fellow, _and you will get him later when

you start Calculus.’_’

Weihad ‘often heard of Calculus and its intricacies, and as we ‘gazed at “Uncle Dan,”

and later heard him read, " in his peculiar style, the scriptures in thestudent assembly,‘ we quaked in our boots.
Our first impression was that hewould be a fellow who could give one a pretty stiﬁ “bawling out,” and that

unlessmarks were well nigh perfect this could be looked for.
Finally the day came «for our introduction to Calculus.

We were in “Uncle Dan’s” class. He was dressed

in his long black coat,’ such as shown above. He proceeded to tell the class in a kindly and fatherly way what
he expected of us. Incidentally, he cracked a few jokes, and before we were through with the session we real-
ized that he was a regular fellow, and we knew we would enjoy our associations with him. As the days went
by we learned to love “UncIe_Dan” all the more and we looked forward to the sessions under him. He was a

wonderful teacher of mathematics--what might be called a f‘mathematical_ shark.”

Anyone who has studied

calculus "knows it is a subject requiring accuracy and clear thinking. “Uncle Dan” could solve problems “in his
head” which would ordinarily cover the blackboard of a whole side of the classroom. When the students were

stumped on a. problem, he would say. “Why that is very simple.”

Then he would walk. up to the board,

cover it with ﬁgures and signs. When therequired result was untangled he would say, with a shrewd knit-
mg of his‘. brows and a knowing smile: “Very, very simple.”

Some of the happiest momentsin

THE ANNUAL ROLL CALL.

“Uncle Dan’s”, life in recent years have been his associations with his

former students at the engineering luncheons, etc. Every year he was given an ovation when he arose to call
the roll. He willbe missed greatly at these luncheons, but his spirit will always be present there. We know
of nothing more inspiring in our work as. Alumni Secretary and Athletic Manager than attending these lunch-
cons ‘and noting men like George Clapp, Joe Trees, George Wittmer, Walter Riddle, Al Hamilton and scores
of others stand up when their names were called and say: “Here I am, ‘Uncle Dan.’ ”

"Uncle Dan” «has passed to his ﬁnal resting place, but he has
dreds of his former pupils which can never be erased.

left an impression on the memory of hun-

We hope that every alumni’ subscriber of _“The Pitt Weekly” will read  l':Iolland’s wonderful tribute to

“Uncle Dan” printed on this page. It was delivered as only Dr. Holland can deliver such an eulogy.

Big Football Banquet

Many athletic celebrities. of the
past at’cended- the big football
banquet at the Hotel »Sch_en1ey,=_ De-

tendance, and it included a j; ﬁne
representation‘ of the 0‘ "I fellcws'who
had ‘on fame for o1d.W. U. P.-and
Pitt in years gone by. This went
back to the days of Bart Smyers
and Floyd Rose, who can count 30
years in talking or’ their gridiron
activities. Bert was the ﬁrst quarter-
back, and Floyd came next.-.Bert
playing on the ’89‘tearn, the ﬁrst in
Pitt’s history. Floyd was toast-
master of the banquet and "Bert. was
called on for a few reminiscences.

In addition‘ to the football letter
men there was letter men represent-
ing other sports such as. track,
basketball, etc. ._Ali:ogether.it was a
mighty successful banquet ‘ which
wound up with the spectacular
feature of the new football‘ captain
being brought in in the big ball.
This stunt was stat:ted~ back in 1917,
Jack Thompson being, responsible
for it. Jack, who was always strong
for football theatrical features, was
active then in thelCap and Gown

DEBATE NOTES

We are sorry that more alumni
did not attend the International De-
bate between Pitt and Oxford Uni
versi’cy'Friday evening, December 10.
The lower floor of Carnegie Music
Hall was comfortably ﬁlled andthe
balcony had about one-half of the
seats taken. The debate was certain-
ly worth ‘listening to. The Alumni
Secretary noticed quite a few alumni
in the crowd, among them being W
C. Arther, ’17. who was prominent
in debate actiities.as.- a manager and
participated while in college.

Another present was John M
_H_enry, former assistant U. S.
District Attorney, who was a
member of the debate team back in
1905, and-at that time a student of
the Law School. The Secretary re-
members a debate in which Mr.
Henry represented old W. U. «P.
against West Virginia. The debate
was held in the First Presbyterian
Church. That was 21 years ago.
Pitt won the debate, the other
members of the University team be-
ing Sydney Kornhauser. Col. ’08, -
Arthur Calhoun. Col. ’06. Korn-
h_ user and Calhoun are both univer
sity professors‘ at other schools, ac-
cord1ngt_o.our latest reports. The
combination of Henry, Calhoun and
Kornhauser was a mighty effective
one. Kornhauser provided the wit

PRESHMAN RULES
Sir:—-- : ' ‘

A newsarticle in the last :issue of
the Pitt‘ Weekly states that “the ‘stu-
dent representative group“ (Student

fact that no vote was- taken‘ in the

:7 discussion of the rules at the meet-

ing seems not to prevent the advo-
cates of the idea from spreading the
idea that there was. In the same
article it is inferred from question-

 ing thirty—ﬁ've freshmen that the

whole class is in favor of froshrules
in the ratio of ten to one. _Where-
fore,» then, the scarcity of dmks on
freshman ‘heads? .

The article brings up for the ..nth
time the question of the desirability
of freshman rules and the’ ability or
inability to enforce them. In theory
probably a majority of upper class-
men believe in them as an aid to
school spirit, class solidarity, etc.
'Let that pass. But can they be en-
forced? I think" that any considera-
tion of the last three years, which
is all I know about, shows emphat1-
cally that they cannot. Every fall a
sporadic effort has been made at
enforcement, and every fall _the
freshmen have doffed their. dmks
within a. month. The fault does not
lie‘ inlthe mechanism of enforcement;
it lies in the unwieldly size of the

Basketeers For -Strenuous Season

Addition of Football Players
Partly Makes Up For Loss
Of Two Regulars. I

The varsity basketball squad, is
shaping up well but will be a little’
lighter than last year’s _stalwart
crew, pre-season dope indicates.
Scrimmages with Lou McMa‘sters’
yearlings are in order several times
a week and should prove of value to
both teams. ‘The men are attaining
splendid physical shape, which is an
undoubted necessity if they.expect
to get away successfully with the
tough assignments mapped out for‘
them. Ohio State, runners up for
the Conference title last year, and
the Eastern leaders, Syracuse; W111
be met within ﬁve days, with the
. , speedy Methodists offering stiff op-

« position between the Buckeye and
Orange games. The Oluoans opened
their season with an easy victory
over Ohio Wesleyan. _ _

Carlson has been using Kowallis
and Wrobleski on forwards, Rehanik
and “Sykes” Reed at guards, with
Red McMahon jumping center. The
inﬂux of football men lias_‘_greatly
cheered the cage enthusiasts _after
the loss of Parsons and Lissfelt,_for

, the gridders are all in good physical

shape and are experienced "players.
Sutherland’s handy “Andyss Cutler
and 'S,alata, were good prep school
.ﬂoor men,- while Paul Fisher was a
stellar center and guard at Avalon
high school. Whitey Hoban. the
speedy halfback, is living up to _his
reputation gained at Sharpesville
high and seems to be a real ﬂoor
ﬁnd for Carlson. Cutler played at
center at Bellefonte and Salata was
a guard at Wyoming Seminary. Ho-
ban cavorted at forward when _he
wore the spangles of Sharpesville
high f school. _

With ex-freshman Captain Smoke
McCand1ess and his erstwhi1e- team-
mates of last year’s frosh machine,
McLean, Meier and .Wunderlich, the

,_remainder of last year’s_great var-

sity, and»’the_fo-otball men. -Red has

no bets in an effort to get his men

_ pin the very pink ‘for the tough Week

_: that looms up so close. ' -

Last Year
_ Last year Pitt enjoyed one of its-
best. seasons. ,  , , ,
‘ even more arduousthan last season s
' a close-ap roach to_the' 1926 record-
will be higl)ily-satisfactory. Pa_rson__’s,
Lissfelti and company captured thir-
teen contestsj out of nineteen at-
tempts. Michigan.‘ drubbed the Pan-
thers 34-25; Goodyear Tire and Rub-
ber, 34-27; Ohio State, 47-34; Grove
City, 33-27; The Covenentors of Ge-

‘ r;.va,\37-29, and West Virginia, 3'1-

~-/30. All these teams were. far from
second raters and to drop a game to
any of them was by no means an
indication of poor ﬂoor work. _ _ _

Monday, January 3, the Carlson-
ites invade Columbus to--wrest 9. _.\l1(‘.-.--
tory from the Buckeyes to_atone_ for
‘last year’s defeat at the hands of
the Staters. A
week will ﬁnd Allegheny at the sta-
dium ﬂoor, and Saturday the Pan'-
thei-s‘ oppose- the Orange at Syra-
cuse. _

After several days’ rest the neigh-
bors from Carnegie. will migrate to
the Pitt floor and will doubtless pro-.
vide an -interesting, contest. Intense
rivalry is manifest ‘whenever Pitt
and Carnegie meet in any sort of an
athletic struggle. Three games in
all are carded with the Tartans; Feb-
rua'-ry- 2 the Panthers play. on Car-
I_iegie’s ﬂoor and the CWO meet for
the third game‘ near the fag end of
the season in the stadium.

West Virginia will come up Janu-
ary 21 and in February the fans of
Morgantown will. be treated to a re-
turn engagement. The fur always
ﬂies when the Panthers and husky
Mountaineers tangle. »_

A tough trip will be in order when
Red’s quint. tackles Michigan State‘
and Notre Dame in. two days on for-.
eign ﬂoors. Returning. home six
days later, the powerfulstate team
will invade the ,stadium.- The sea-
son -will be closed with the Center
County boys at State College.

The Wolverines will furnish the
big home game of -the year, Febru-
ary 12. -Michigan is one of the lead-
ers of ‘the country in all athletic
branches and doubtless will provide
the most attractive game on the
schedule. '

Coach McMasters is putting his
through their last strenuous prac-
tices before the; Christmas, vacation
on the stadium‘ cor. The boys are
rounding into-"mid-season form un-
der the stiif work given them by
Mclllasters. The original squad,

downto twenty-ﬁve men. I
Fifteen of these twenty-ﬁve men
have been equipped with basketball
uniforms. Out of the ﬁfteen who
are included in the select circle,
there, are seven forwards, ﬁve
guardsand three centers. The men
who are out for the center position
are Cohen of Uniontown fame, Ar-
thurs of McKeesport high, and Reg-
isteiiiyof Bellevue high.
‘ Among‘ the’ forwards are -Hyatt,
Cohen’s old co-worker. at Union-

Sandberg of Erie East, Laifer, for-
mer Staunton star; Loughran of
Swissvale, Zehfuss of South Hills
high, and.Sulzener of ‘Wilki sburg.

The guards are: Edwards‘ 0 '.Wy-
omin Seminary, lvforitz, a guard
on t e last year’s- “Pennsylvania
Freshmen team; Montgomery of
Wheelin , W. Va., School of Wells-
ville, 0 io, and Ashbaugh, former
Kiski luminary. However, the above
mentioned lads are "not-at all sure
of remaining in the select group for

of the more fortunate ones at any
time. - ‘p .

It is expected that Coach McMas-
ters -will make another cut in the
squad very shortly, _for the ﬁrst
game is January 4 audit is unlike-
ly that McMasters will carry. a
squad twenty-five on his team.

ing a team tostart the ﬁrst‘ game.

Many wild rumors are circulating

Riﬂe Team Outshoots, _ g
Williams and Drexel

the onslaught of Pitt {riﬂers with 9.
Score, of 1,529, 355 oints lessthan
the local score of ,884. Monday,
W. .‘ I-Ioriier, riﬂe‘ manager, was
notiﬁed by telegraph that Drexel‘

smilin — broadly’ today at the. suc-
cess 0 his riﬂemen, and was 0 tim-
istic. regarding the '_outcome‘ 0 this
week’s match‘ with Dartmouth.
Overwhelming Williams“ by ' such’
a one-sided avalanche, was a big,
surprise to the "Pitt Riﬂe captain,
Jack Lauler. Shooting as if they
were stalking Indians in , pioneer
days, team members hung" up_ the
following scores: K. Diver 381, J.
W. Lauler-38,1, W. L. Homer 377, K.-
Hinderer 373, and P. G. Atkinson

B -Gibby Welch Predicts‘
‘Killer’ Card For_1927

“Present~in‘dications for next '
year's football campaign would;
'. point to a possible ‘killer,’ ”
says ‘Gibby Welch, Pitt's new
football captain. Gibby has
not yet forgotten the gruelling
seasonrjust past and the addi-
tion ‘of Drake and Nebraska,
to the already tough schedule
justiﬁes his calling next>year”s
grind a. “killer.”
' His voice takes‘ on the Gil
Dobian aspect, as he continues:
“But of course.. no predictions
as to_._the winning, of every
game can be made with any
- common sense . thinking. In
_tli‘e., present keen‘ coinpetitio‘n
between "college" teams, any
goods club is likely to get
‘bumped off.’ One has only to‘
look at the: numerous upsets to
v:i_'ify that statement; The
coming up‘ of this year’s fresh-
man'team seems to throw-some
light‘ on our possibilities, as
their presence should strength-
en our reserves great. deal.
-After all, a team is strong only
when ‘the reserve - strength - is
stron .” _ ’
Gibby stated that it was per-
fectly all right with ‘him that

 

-.-

wrmit him to‘ go to ‘the coast.‘
He said that he-is always Will‘: -
lng to abide by-' the council-"s,

:.a-.——.

The .~ annual Pitt’ intercollegiate
track and ﬁeld championships have

‘been deﬁnitely. dropped_ from the

track schedule for this spring. Grad.
uate Manager K. E. Davis said that
he , had received communications
from West Virginia and Penn State
that they would be_ unable to compete
in-the big_ meet this year. This fact,
Davis points out, would make the

' meet really only a dual affair be-

tween Carnegie Tech and Pitt, and
as the two schools already have ‘a
dual meet scheduled for an earlier
date, it would be impractical from
any standpoint.

Davis says, however, that the In-
terscholastics, which have always

en a part of the Intercollegiate
meet, will be held on the date prev-
iously set for the combined meets.
To_take the place of the Intercol-
legiate meet on the varsity track
schedule, the athletic authorities are
negotiating for a dual meet with
some other.school. It is understood
that‘_a‘.d_iial meet with Syracuse uni-
versity is being tentatively planned.

Lack .of Interest

The Intercollegiates have been a
part of.- the Panther track schedule

however, it has been noticed that
there was an apparent lack, of inter-
est in the. meet shown by the tri-
state schools. It is the custom of
the schools of the tri-state district

the district on their schedule for
“dual ineets, and it is believed that
they did not care to r'neet_the same
schools again in a conference meet.
.'They preferred rather to schedule
a. dual meet with some other school
or else take part in some large relay
carnival. In view of these facts
the Intercollegiates were abandoned.
Several other important changes
have been made in the.Panther var-
sity track schedule which was ﬁrst
given out at the close of last track
season. Geneva, -which had been
scheduled for Saturday, April 23, as
the opening meet, has been dropped
from the_'schedule and nothing. has
been added in its place as 'yet. If
-no meet is arranged for this date,
the Panther ‘spike’-pushers will not
open their season until the following
Saturday, April 30-, at the Penn re-
lays. -
Ohio Relays .
The following Saturday, May 7, a
full team will be sent to‘ the Ohio
relays at Columbus, 0., Tuesday,
May 10, Carnegie Tech will be met.
inithe stadium, and Saturday,..May
14, .West Virginia u‘nivers’ity track
team will also be met at Pitt_sta-
.dium_. The Pitt Interscholastics, and
possibly a dual meet for the varsity,
will be held in the stadium Saturday,
May 21. On Saturday, May, 28,,the
track team will be taken to the In-
tercollegiate championships at Har-
.va.rd.- The season’s close will find
the Panther cinderpath men away
from ‘home, the trackers going to
Center county Saturday, June 4, to
meet Penn State Lions in their own
lair.
Freshmen Added
This Schedule, with the addition
of -one or two more dual meets, will
be the most ambitious a Panther
track and ﬁeld team has ever faced,
and it is believed that Coach Frank
Shea will have a team that will. be
able to_face it. The old varsity ‘men
Wlf10'l’_V1ll_.lJe back on the team‘ are
-Captain Linn,-Welch, Hank Schmidt,

Magee, Grindle, Long, Wick, Rearick,
Adams, Arens, Crawford, Norris,"
Gorski. and Rutter.

The team will be further augment-
ed by the addition of the prominent
These iii-
clude Pickaifd,-Olympic pole vaulter;

' Gwynn, hammerthrower who broke

‘Jock Sutherland’s record; Voiglit, a

_ hurdler; Wibecan, sprinter; Hoffman,

distance runner, and Campbell‘ and
Davis, both distance men. Pete Bow-
en, sprinter, and Rob -Roy, half-
miler,‘ who were meinbersof the 1925
freshmen team, but who have never
competed for.the varsity, will add
strength ‘to . the cinder-strutters’

‘squad.

, It is expected, also, that Gibby
-Welch, Pitt’s candidate for. All-
American honors, will be much im-

1 proved, over last season, and that _
Captain-elect Linn, Gibby’s compan-

ion in the ‘weights, will also break
Pitt‘ marks, too. Pitt’s particular
weakness may come in the quarter-
mile and the hurdles.
who last year took care of the four-

— forty racket, has graduated, as have

Fabianaand Harrington, Pitt’s best
hurdlers. The,hurdles this year _will
have;to be taken care of by Dwight
Fyock and Charley Voight. Rutter,
Bower or-Wick, if the latter’s cross-_‘\
country injury clears up. will likely
be Pitt’s hope in the “440.” 3
