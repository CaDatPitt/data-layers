 ickel shows optimism
or yourig Americans

by SHARON SEXTON

, Walter J. Hickel, former Secretary of the Interior and former
:‘?Governor of Alaska‘, exhibits an exuberant display of confidence in
‘(the wisdom of the American people; especially in regard to Amer-
i‘ca’s youth.

3, Hickel, a,simple, energetic man, displays the wholesome-
ess one would expect from someone who was originally a Kansas
warm boy. He went through a lot of hard times in the dust bowl
ears of the depression in Kansas, as a boxer, and as a pioneer in‘
laska when he settled there in 1940. These experiences have left
fl.-Iickel with a resilience and flexibility which hajverbeen invaluable
ftoghis political career.

"‘ In 1970, after the publication of Hickel’s famous Faithfully
,‘Yours, Wally letter in which he urged'that the administration take
cognizance of “the attitude of a great mass of Americans—our
young people,” he was fired as Secretary of the Interior.

‘- Today, Hickel says, “I hold no animosity toward Nixon or his
dm'inistration.” The president needs no reasons for firing some-
ne—cabinet members serve at his pleasure.” Hickel says that he
oes not question why Nixon hired him. “A question that does
lague me though, is, ‘Why did he ever hire me?’ ”

 “Everybody knew who the real Wally Hickel was and what he
stood for,” he said.“No one was surprised when I took a strong
“stand on environmental issues.” He was unable to account, how-
;ever,’f_or Richard Nixon’s obvious surprise when the real Wally
I ‘ickel stood up. ‘
,‘.i-L.-‘Hickel sees the “old Political conservative era” slowly vanish-
ing. He believes that the era and its politicians are being re-
,placed in the Senate and the House by “young-minded innovative
“politicians” with the desire to initiate change.

 / Hickel believes that youth will play a vital role in this
change as a result of their newly acquired vote. “Youth can swing
this election and the ones to come,” Hickel said.

 Regarding the upcoming election, Hickel said he would sup-
port Nixon in his bid for the nomination. He felt that any incum-
‘bent President should be given the nomination if he sought it,
so that he could “put his programs up for the approval of the peo-
ple:’_’ - ‘

.As_regards his own political future, Hickel said he may run
for governor or senator of Alaska in 1974.’ He said, however, that
hefwould “willingly help any administration, if given the oppor-
trinity to work on issues concerning the environment.”

 'VWhen asked about the feasibility of his plans for the environ-
ment, Hickel replied with his characteristic optimism, “I believe
they can work, if you put men in there who want to make ‘them
work.”

    
  
   
  
  
   
  
 
   
   
   
 
 
  
  
   
  
   
 
    
  
  
   
  
  
  
 

IVinning team at Pitt

DehateI's’merits lauded

by DIANE HOLLINGSWORTH

What draws students to Pitt,
besides promises of ‘a good ath-
letic program? The Pitt Debating
Society, according to Dr. Thomas
Kane, professor of speech and
sponsor of the organization. A1-
tholigh a debate doesn’t get the

publicity of a football game, the.
fact remains that Pitt has one of '

the best debating teams in the
nation. And they’ll have a chance
to prove how good they are
when the team of John Strand
and James Kearney compete
with 63 other teams in the na-
tional championships, April '15-
18 at the University of Utah.

Pitt won the state cham-
pionship at Duquesne last week-
end. They debated 19 other teams
for the honor.

The championship was decided
by the composite score of three
teams, made up of Eugene Sto-
ker, Wes McGinnis, Ken Simon,
David Green, Mike Heneroty

.and Robert Prorok. Since this

was their third win in four years,
they retire the trophy.

This weekend, the team has

I an opportunity to make another

Pitt first—-to have two teams
qualify for the nationals. At the
District 7 contest, Pitt’s second
team, consisting of Stoker and
McGinnis, will compete against
the first teams from schools of

the caliber of Rutgers, Navy,

George Washington, and the
University of West Virginia. “If
we. win,” said -Kane, “we’ll
have two teams at the finals, an
accomplishment shared by only
two or three schools in the coun-
try. I think we stand a good
chance?’

Besides their competitive prow- .

ess, the Debating Society serves
an important public relations
function. The team of Simon and
Green recently appeared on tele-
vision against the University of
Nebraska in Nebraska, and in
Iowa against Morningside.

 

Assistant Coach Mike Kelly and
debater Jerry lwler: setting high
standards. -

The teams also debate for
high school assemblies, and spon-

sor a high ‘school tournament,

every December, which in-
cludes schools from as far away
as Michigan, Virginia and North
Carolina. At the tournament,
many students get acquainted
with Pitt, and later come here.
The excellent debate program
is a drawing-card for social
science majors and others in-
terested in debate.

In addition the debaters,help
the, college relate to outside
groups. Last year the Society
was asked to debate against
Wayne State, before the National

Convention of Automatic Car .

Washes. The topic was full-ser-
vice versus external car wash-
ing, a crucial issue in that in-

/dustry. The businessmen were
pleased, and the students learn-
ed a lot about car washing.

“I think it helps us to over-

.come stereotypes,” commented
’ “We really had at

Kane.
chance to reach Middle Ameri-
ca, to show them that students
with long hair can still be in-
telligent.”

Anyone can join the Debat-
ing Society, but it requires a lot
of time and effort. The season
runs from October until April,
with the topic for the year’s
debates published in July.

The debaters spend most of
their summers doing research,

-then come back the week before

classes to begin practice de-
bates. They give up their holi-
days and spend long weekends
at other colleges. When pos-
sible, they drive themselves,
doubling up on hotel rooms

, to cut expenses.

Recognition is scarce. As
Kane remarked,-- “It’s frustrating
to the debater to come home
after having beaten UCLA and
find that nobody knows it.?’

But there are rewards. For
one thing, researching the same
topic for a year teaches a lot
about the subject; for instance,
last year’s topic was the neces-
sity for wage and price controls,
and debate‘ society members
were very aware of the situ-
ation when the President insti-
tuted his economic policy.

“ Dr. Kane feels that the hard
work is a helpful challenge.
“What college students are miss-
ing today is devotion to achieve-
ment,. the need to accomplish
something. Debaters set high
standards for themselves,” he
said.

The Debate Society makes
many trips, because they have to
go where the competition is. No
one in Pennsylvania can com-
pete with'Pitt, so the team goes
to the West and the South,very
proud of their at-large status.

Computerized errors £llll‘ihl1l6(l to

students and system complexity

by PAULA YURKOVICH

At the beginning of each term,
frustrated students wade through
lines in the Registration and Stu-

‘dent Accounts offices to battle,

computerized errors on their in-
voices.

Typical problems involve be-
ing billed twice, not receiving
the invoice until after the due
date (with a fee, attached), in-
curring an extra $30 insurance
fee, or being registered for
courses the student did not know
existed.

Jim Beavers, Manager of Stu-
dent Accounts, attributed the
majority of errors to the stu-
dents themselves. The major
mistakes, he said, are the trans-
position of the first two digits
of the social security number
and the name changes of newly
married women without pre-
vious documentation.

Beavers noted that a recent
study of 200 invoicing errors
revealed that 60 percent of
these were student-oriented.

Vice-Chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton and Registrar

Richard Allshouse agreed with
Beavers but said that only a
small percentage of students
maliciously try to beat the sys-
tem and delay their billing.

Allshouse stated, “I trust stu-
dents inherently. They don’t cre-
ate problems intentionally.”

Administration officials be-
lieve that the complexity of the
overall computer system con-
tributes greatly to the problem.

Dutton remarked: “My con-
tention is that the limitations
of the computer are not com-
pletely recognized by its users.”

He stated that his staff is
working on ways “to control
input of information in a sense
that it will be machine com-
patible.”

Beavers added that about 40
percent of the invoice problems
are due to actual key punch
errors, badly printed class cards,
secretarial mistakes, and general
foul up within the complexities
of the computer.

Allshouse said, “If we can
separate the_invoices from the

registration slips, it could cause
less confusion.” He added that
a deferred payment system also

9 might help.

Dutton favors setting up a com-
plaint bureau for those students
who have legitimate gripes
against the offices of the Regis-
trar, Administrative Systems, or
Student Accounts.

He views the student as a cus-
tomer who is being sold the ser-
vices of education and must be
treated with consideration.

With 28,000 students at Pitt,
Dutton emphasized, “No person
or group is the sole cause of
the problem.”

0 Holland named  
CAS assistant dean

An Associate Professor in the Speech Department, Dr. Audrey
Holland, has been named the new Assistant Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences. Holland replaces Dr. Rae Siporin of the English
Department, who will be serving an internship with the American
Council of Education during the next year.

Dr. Holland will assume her position on July 1st. She gradu-
ated Magna Cum Laude from Pitt in 1955 with a B.A. in Psychol-
ogy. She received her masters and doctorate in speech at Pitt in
1959 and 1960, respectively. Holland served as an Assistant and Asso-
ciate professor at Emerson College in Boston from 1960-1964. .

In 1965 she served as the Director of Research and Training at
the Home for Crippled Children in Pittsburgh. During 1966 she serv-
ed as a research scientist at the American Institute of Research.
While she served in these capacities, she served as an adjunct pro-
fessor in the speech department.

In 1967 Holland resigned her other positions to become an as-
sistant professor, and in 1969 was promoted to the position of Asso-
ciate Professor in the Speech Department where she taught courses
in speech pathology and communications.

PIRG funding issue

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD

Tuesday‘s Student Govern-
ment vote" on the Chancellor's
proposal to fund PIRG through
the Activities Fee resulted in a
stalemate.

Three members, President Tom
Bailey, and Board Members
Terri Weaver and Walt Wills,
supported the proposal, while
Robert Stack,lDavid Bluey, and
Terry Sadler cast opposing votes.

Student Activities Director
Bill Markus had previously pre-
sented a statement by the Chan-
cellor, requesting the Board con-
sider the possibility of using the
fee as the basic vehicle for fund-
ing PIRG.

The Board members contend-
ed that PIRG has not yet ap-
proached them with a clarifica-
tion of its position. Bailey noted
that this lack in communications
placed the Board at a distinct
disadvantage. ‘

The eventual outcome will de-
pend upon a PIRG representa-
tive presenting SG with viable
alternatives. A h

The possibility of a negative
check-off procedure (a system
whereby the student could mere-
ly check off on his’ invoice whe-
ther or not he desired a refund‘
met with criticism on the grounds
that if more than 49 percent of
the student body were. to opt
for a refund, the organization
could not be justified under its
own requirement thati51 percent
of the student body approve.

Questions also arose as to the
possibility of the extra addition
to the invoice, but were disre-
garded at the.urging of Dr; Al-
fred Moye, Dean of Student

 

\
Affairs, reflecting the sentiments

"of the Chancellor and Joseph

Dutton, Vice Chancellor of Oper-
ations, that this would prove un-
feasible to the present invoicing
system.

In‘ other business, the Board
named Michael Yesko its Fi-
nancial Director, whose present
responsibility is to help setup
the SG budget.

Upon recommendation by
David Bluey, Kathy Hirsh was
appointed Public Relations. Di-
rector. .

In addition, three committee
chairmen were approved: Carol
Wallecki for the Medical Ac-
tion, Committee, Tim Ging for
Off-Campus Housing, "and Jeff
Pasek for the Legal Awareness
Committee. ‘

 

(Continued from Pace 4)
fifty and twenty four people end
up with numbers between one
and thirty one.

What happened was that the
housing official present and her
assistants from the men's Dorm
Council made, the foolish mistake,
of believing that the students
would conduct themselves hon-
estly and did not take the pre-
caution of marking the housing
receipts of the students when they
drew tickets. Hence, many stu-
dents went back many times and
took. all the tickets they could lay
their hands on. '

I think that the whole lottery
should be declared invalid and
should be repeated—this time

under close supervision, .

Computer   woes cured   

by ROB OBENREDER

The University’s Computer
Center has been in a constant
state of flux for several years.

The first of a long series of
modifications took place origin-
ally because of the great dis-
satisfaction across campus with
the functioning of the Computer
Center. Charging of depart-
ments and individuals for com-
puter use was a major com-
plaint. -

It was at this time the Execu-
tive Committee of the Center
was formed. The committee was
to examine the present situa-
tion and determine the criteria
for changing the Center’s_ opera-
tions.

On July 1, 1970, the Comput-
er Center was opened on a free
usage basis, and was immedi-
ately swamped with an unex-
pected number of users. The
Executive Committee then took
steps to double the computer
time available while remain-
ing within their present budget
of $1.7 million. ' e

The ‘largest problem the com-'

mittee faced was the conversion
from the old‘ to the new equip-
ment, installed by the Digital
Corporation.
two greatest hindrances in ef-
fecting a change were budget
and space limitations. Since

Oakland space was at a premium, -

the main banks of the computer
could be located elsewhere.
Space was obtained at the Re-
gional Industrial -Development

Corp. (RIDC) in O’Hara Town--

ship. A delivery service by car
was established for large jobs,
and in the future, another de-

The.

livery vehicle will hopefully’be
added to further improve ser
vice.’ , '
Two types of input centers
to serve computer users were
planned: staff attended satel-
lite centers, and unattended

A satellite center in Engin-
eering Hall is now nearing com-
pletion and may be in opera-
tion by April 1. RJE centers
have been established on the
ground floor of the Cathedral,
in the basement of the Library
and Information Sciences Build-
ing, on the tenth floor of Bene-
dum Hall, and at the branch

campus in Greensburg. Hillman

library has a private BRJE for
their computerized circulation
system. Chairman of the Exe-
cutive Committee of the Com-
puter Center, Allen Kent said
that more RJE stations may be
established in the future, but
added that the committee would

- "wait a little bit until the change

is finished, and see where. the
people will go."

The conversion from the "old
to the new system will also re-
quire the conversion of programs

’ from one computer language
another. The new system "—W'
use Fortran IV, which ‘Ken
described as “the most popula
language.” In cases where «I
g'uage conversion ‘would ‘be i _
possible ortoo costly, the com
mittee would allocate fundsto;
buy time on another. system;

 

Kent mentioned many’ depart-—:«
ments were behind ‘schedule. ‘
.in their conversions and said, 0,
“We will try to handle them as’,
fast as possible.” » ‘

The switch from the ‘old to their
new system will not be a drama- ~
tic change, Kent warned, due to‘,
the fact that the use of both’
systems has_ practically doubled B
capacity already. In April the
new computer will simply take”?
over the entire job. '

Even with the capacity doub—‘
led, the increased computer.‘-
usage will necessitate the‘allo-
cation of time, and a priority 1
list will be drawn up. Kent stat-
ed, "The number one priority.
will be students '

ed research.” But an “aging proj-
cess}’ giving priority to programs‘

waiting a certain length of time,
would also be in effect. 4 '

Pitt teams have won about 75
percent of the hundreds of de-
bates in which they have parti-
cipated this year. In a regular
contest, which may include up
to 150 schools, each team is in
eight debates, qualifying for
finals on the basis of their num-
ber of victories.

While his team is debating.
Dr. Kane is busy_ judging other
teams. Judging is done on the
same principle_as figure skating
competitions; experience teaches
judges what to look for. Judg-
ments are largely esoteric, but
criteria include analysis, clash.
and the winning of crucial argu-
ments.

A choral event certain to help rectify this
neglect will occur this coming Sunday when the
Heinz Chapel Concert Choir and Orchestra, con-
ducted by Dr. Don Franklin, will present Joseph
Haydn’s Heiligmesse-at Heinz Chapel at 3 p.m.

Dr. Denes Bartha, a Mellon Professor from ‘our

music department and a widely

scholar, has high hopes for the performance of

“intimate and lasting” work. According to ,

 ‘Bartha, .Sunday’s performance will “be close ‘to

With opening day less than
three weeks away, the Pitt base-

. ball squad has yet to practice
outdoors. The first two weeks
have seen . the mitters fielding
ground balls in the Trees Hall
, gymnasium and smashing wick-
ed line drives into the Field

House hitting cage.
Despite‘ the present lack of
scrimmaging, veteran Coach

Bobby Lewis is counting on
the upcoming Florida trip to pre-
pare his team.

* “Our one week (March 25-31)

. ~ stay down South should help me

decide who the number three

and four pitchers will be,” ex-

plained Lewis. “For all I know,

the Florida trip might be the

first time our kids get a chance
to get in some decent hitting.

b “There is no substitute for
‘ game . experience. I just wish
2 we could also have a fall sche-

dule. It would make it much

spring. The worst part of these
gym practices is that I have
to make cuts that are too sub-
jective.” A

 

easier to pick a team for the‘

E

O Weathe'r stalls mitters

Two positions that Lewis-
need not worry about are first
base and catcher. Senior Ken
Macha (IB) and junior Guy
Caparelli (C) are the mitters’
two leading hitters returning
from last year’s 18-8 squad.

One of the country’s finest
slugging first sackers, Macha
batted .415, with 34 hits, seven
roundtrippers, and 31 RBI’s in
1971.

Although he fanned eighteen
times last season, the free-swing-
ing Caparelli peppered the ball
at a .344 clip.

Pitchers Mike Niccols (5-1)
and Albert Sylanski (5-3) are
back to give Pitt a mighty 1-2
mound punch. Niccols utilized
remarkable control in walking
only eight batters in 41 innings
on.his way to a 1.97- ERA. Syl-
anski’s 47 strikeouts led the ball-
club.

Listed on the depth chart
as the number three starter,
junior- Mike Fedoris (l-3) hurl-
ed a perfect game last year. In
an erratic season, Fedoris com-
piled a 5.06 ERA while whiffing
44 batters.

his pitching, Lewis replied,
“We have several back-to-back
doubleheaders this year. We
just have to find four starting
pitchers.”

Paul Quarantillo and Danny
Slain are waging a battle for
the third base position. Both
players were at the hot corner
in 1971, although neither
wielded a heavy bat.

_Junior Bob Livingston ap-
pears to have the keystone job
locked up. A starter‘ last sea-
son, Livingston ranked fourth
on the club in RBI’s (11) and
swatted his way to a .268
mark at the plate.

Having signed a pro contract
last June with the Boston Red
Sox, Terry Stokes leaves quite a

"gap for Lewis to fill at short- :

stop.

Returning lettermen outfield-
ers include starter Dennis ‘To-
boz and Harry Pardini. Catcher
Bill Schmidtke has decided to
cast his lot with the flychasers
in an effort to crack the start-
ing lineup.

S Webster cites strength

of ’72 tennis squad;

F H urwitz, Pine. return

by RON SIEGEL

Enthusiasm and increased depth have, led Coach Fran Webster
and his players to look for a good showing this year from the ten-

nis team.

The squad has been practicing indoors all winter, and will be

moving outside as soon as the
weather permits.

Webster feels good about the
upcoming season. “This is prob-
ably the strongest team Pitt has
had in four years,” he said, “I’m
looking for a winning year. ”

This is Webster’s third year
as tennis coach—since coming to
the school with Buzz Ridl from
Westminster. At that time he

inherited a team that had’ not_

won a single match.

In his first season, the netters
won five games, while last year
showed only three victories. The
team was hurt last season when
freshman player of the year,
Joel Hurwitz, in ‘addition to
Michael Pine did not compete.

The team does not get any
full scholarships, and as a result,
many/ potential ‘stars who" "do.
not attend spring session 'are
unable to compete. Hurwitz and
Pine,’ however, are both expect-
ed to play this year. ' ‘

None of the positions have
been determined yet for this
season, but freshman Joe Kantor,
according to Webster, “looks
like he has the best.chance for
number one.”

» In addition to Hurwitz and
Pines-, big threats to.-' Kantor,in-
elude returning lettermen Tom
McKnight, Gary Schwartz, and

, Bill Wood.‘ Schwartz is the only _

senior on the squad.

The netters open their fifteen

With the return of seven let-
termen and a fine squad of hope-
ful prospects, ,Coach Rex
Peery’s golf squad seems to be
headed for a bright future.

“We have a good bunch of boys
returning from last year,” com-
mented Peery, “And I expect
that we’ll be_ well over the .500
mark at the season’s'end. Bu_t
that doesn’t mean our opponents
won’t be tough.”

/Along with Big Four rivals I

Penn State and West Virginia,
the team will meet cross-town
rivals C—MU, and Duquesne.
Also on the schedule of 12 dual
meets are Bueknell, Clarion, In-
diana, Cleveland State, and Al-

ANDERSON

legheny.

Another Big Four team, Syra-
cuse, decided to drop competi-
tive golf because of a lack of
funds. This same problem, will
cause the Panther swingers to
miss the EIGA finals at Colgate
in early May.

With the first dual meet
against WVU coming up next
week at Green Oaks Country
Club, the team will be hamper-
ed by a lack of practice due to
the erratic weather conditions.

“I’m a little wary of that first
meet with West Virginia since
we haven’t held a practice as of
yet. Hopefully we’ll be on the
courses this week if the weather
allows us to. I don’t think WVU

I ‘Anderson nabs ski title

Bruce Anderson, a 26 year old
senior and economics major at
Pitt, is now considered to be

"‘the fastest man on skiis in

Western Pennsylvania.’ ’

Skiing against over 300 com-
petitors, Anderson won the
“Downhill Challenge Cup” at
the Boyce Park ski Area in the
amazing time of 15.75 seconds.

The native of Lower Burrell

_ has been an avid skier for 15

years. At present he is a mem-
ber of the National Ski Patrol
and on many occasions has res-
cued injured skiers from the
slopes.

When asked how he won the
downhill competition, Anderson
replied, “I just sat back on my
skiis and let them slide.”

Peery added.

,Wi'th senior lettermen Rick
Planka, John Kubala, Tim Christ,
and Mike Jones plus underclass-
men Ed Bullano, Bob Brourman,
and Steve Kosalac, the Panthers
shouldhave the necessary mix-
ture of experience and ability
for a successful season.

The possibility of freshman
golfers participating with the

varsity under the new NCAA’
-ruling now gives some fine»

prospects the chance of early
experience. This, along with re-
cruiting of high school golfers,
leaves the distant Pitt golf fu-
ture one of the brightest in the
team’s history.
