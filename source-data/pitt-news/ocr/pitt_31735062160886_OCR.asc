Feud Ends #
SGA Year

By EDWIN ZINMAN

Activities of Monday’s Stu-
dent Government Association
meeting centered upon pro-
posed afﬁliation with the Na-
tional Student Association.

Judicial Committee Chair-
man Woody Turner, Col. ’61,
charged the NSA with “possessing
a past record of alleged affilia-
tion with\ the Communist Party
according to Congressional re-
ports.”

Kent Jarrell, Col. ’60, sent by
SGA to a recent NSA convention,
denied any current affiliation.

Jarrell claimed that “Since 1955
any implied left-wing tendencies
of NSA have been eliminated. Be-
fore SGA joins any organization
its activities will be thoroughly
investigated. Therefore it will be
necessary togather correct in-
formation regarding current or-
ganizational activities of NSA.”

In a further statement he noted,
“Presently NSA is viewed with
favor by Congress since NSA’s of-
ﬁcers are frequently called upon
as student authorities in the ﬁeld
of higher education.”

Past Student Congresses con-
templated joining NSA six differ-
ent times. Two delegates were sent
to their National Convention with
the subsequent advice by one not
to join NSA and the other's rec-
ommendation to join so as to
“ﬁght it from within.”

No delegate will be sent to the
National convention this year.

‘‘New Dimensions of Learn-

Edward H. Litchﬁeld’s inaug-
ural address will be translat-
ed into Italian for publication

in Europe.

Dr. Silvio Lessona, director of
the Graduate School in Admini-
strative Sciences of the Univers-
ity of Bolonga, Ital.y, has been
granted permission to translate
the Chancellor's address into It-
alian for publication at the Uni-
versity of Bolonga.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld delivered
the inaugural address at last
years colorful inaugural cere-
mony which climaxed a three-day
program which included three
major academic lectures, 17
learned meetings in the various
fields represented by the Univers-
ity’s schools and major divisions,
and dedication of four new uni-’
versity buildings.

In his talk he examined the
functions which must be met by
the modern university in our
American culture, and outlined
nine ways through which the
University of Pittsburgh will at-
tempt to meet these responsibili-
ties in the years ahead.

The inaugural ceremonies were
planned by a large committee of
University of Pittsburgh trustees
and faculty to signalize not only
the inauguration of a new chan-‘S

of a new program which recog-
nizes the trustee directive that the

Down And Out  ~ I .

By Millard Amdult

The present recession has brought forth a wealth

of opinions from people in the knowand people
’in the show. .

Few of these really seem to know what they’re

talking about, and we are at the moment hope-
‘ lessly mired in the pit of indecision and “do-
nothingness.” _ . '

The president's nationwide speech last Tuesday
to business leaders, although
very impressive, and featuring
the usual resounding cheers and
standing ovations, told the Amer-
ican people nothing.

He again exhorted the nation’s
‘businesses to expand their in-
ventories, give the customers
better values, increase capital in-
vestments, drive for “the widest
possible markets,” strive for
more production and more jobs.

Eisenhower at one point in his
speech urged, f‘Let’s be realistic.” The viewers and
listeners wondered if he himself had followed this
good piece of advice. *

 

Anyone can make statements of promise concern-
ing the economy and the fact that America will
“grow and grow” is magniﬁcent, but does this .cause
a change in the present slump?

The vacillation concerning a move‘to cut taxes,
adjust taxes, or take a stand that might later look
bad with voters if it fails to provide a’ solution is
prevalent in both parties.

The minor recession, already of nine months
duration with few, if any, signs of slackening-, con-
tinues ominously.’

This summer, students will be very fortunate to
ﬁnd any job. Those who have begun the search
know this.

Eisenhower claims “Our economy has grown
strong because our people have jobs for each other

and not relied on the government to try to do it for
them.”

Yet it appears that many of the board chairmen
-who were being addressed listen to many speeches,

Nixon, Mitchell, and Truman claimed that they
believed this the solution. Others joined them. Fi-

sheer folly; Eisenhower agreed. Nothing is done.

We almost believe a truism the Washington Post
cartoon showing Eisenhower seated at the head of
a stately table saying to the boys: “Well, Men,
What’ll We Refrain From Doing Now?”

Living up to this fairly realistic humorous ap-
praisal of the situation, they’re all hedging again.
Eisenhower said in his latest public address, “cer-
tain decisions will be taken shortly in the ﬁeld of
taxation.”

Press Secretary Jim Hagerty later answered
newsmen that they should not interpret the remark
to mean “necessarily” that the Administration will
advocate a tax cut.» 7

Nine Months Later

By David Breakstone

I recall, with some difficulty,
that about nine months ago, at
the outset of the school year, I
was faced .with the same pro-

blem that confronts me today.
Then, as now,
I was lightly
charged with
the not incon-
siderable task
of turning out
an editorial
column. This,
without aid of

s u b j e c t o r
highly biased
opinion, could

h av e b e e n
somewhat of a

disaster.

However, I fell back on an
old weapon, and on that thickish
night in September, I launched
into wicked attack upon a
sweeping generalization. The ob-
ject of my criticism was the
growing move to classify the
college student under conveni-
ently grandiose adjectives such
as “conservative,” “apathetic,”
or “materialistic.” I rebelled’at
being neatly ﬁled under a fool-
ish phylum, and thought that
many other “free-thinkers”
would too. I was right.

At least I was right at the
time. Today, I am not so sure of
my position. With the appear-
ance of my September column, I
was assured by many that in-
dividualism, if not rampant, was,
far from dormant.

I was convinced by the atti-
tude of the Pitt hall-walker in
the fall that the cult of faceless-
ness had lost its worshippers
here. The pervasive enthusiasm

The ‘Union had replaced the
ill—famed Tuck Shops as center
of the student private life. Some-
one even got away with covertly
vaporizing the Red Tuck Shop
so that visual aids could be pre-
sented to would—be teachers. De-
bate and the News were at each
others throats arguing about
who was better, and whose ad-
viser would win out in the face-
saving duel which never mat-
erialized.

Dorms Emerge

The emergence of the dormi-
tories as'a unifying element was
recognized by all, including the
“ever watching eyes” of_ the
University police who thought
perchance a pyromaniac was on
the loose. The trimester plan
raised a tempestvin the chan-
cellorial teapot, but aroused stu-
dent opinion was placated by the
“postponed implementation” po-
licy which curiously’ resembled
that old Constitutional phrase,
“with all deliberate speed.”

Perhaps, the most encouraging‘

aspect of local individuality, to
my mind, was the student elec-
tion campaign. The challenge of
the “outs” to the “ins” aroused
the great inert mass of political
energy in many people. The
series of assemblies and cafe-
teria harangues stimulated the
largest turnout in school history.

Incidentally, the “outs” proved
that an election campaign, ﬁ-

,nanced by nothing, more sub-

stantial than promises and in-
spired double-talk, can be a
genuine educational experience
and the source of new and un-

   

orthodox friendships.
Under educational indidivual-
ism, the Honors Convocation and

the Special Undergraduate Fel- ,

lowsrhip Program of the multi-’
lateral head of the Counceling
Center were acclaimed as signal
academic advances by my in-
dividualists. Even a new tighten-
ing of the classroom screws was
evidenced by increased use of
the libraries and decreased use
of the lawns for spring exercise.

IIBu+lI V 7
Now, perceptive reader, comes
the inevitable “but” to the fore-
going arguments for Pitt indi-
viduality. In reality, my suspen-
sion of positive judgment may
be due to a personal eccentricity,
but. I can’t help feeling that
therei can’t be individualism
where national myopia exists.
The lack of interest in what
is going _on politically in _.the
United States seems to be a fet-
ish on all college preserves. And
when I say “phlitically” I mean
it in the fullest sense of the
word: those intelectual, moral,
artistic, as well as state—craft
activities which are character-

istic of the national body politic.-

By indifference to the obvious
drift of our country, the college
population may be purposely
burying its head in the sand to

avoid a grim international pic-

ture and an uninviting national
caricature of decaying standards.

If this is true, as the prophets
of gloom would advocate, then
my case for individualism begun
last September is shoddy. If they
are wrong, we can rest reserved-
ly‘ until the fall, secure in the
knowledge that no .“safe” college
type exists and that none will if
we can continue thinking inde-
pendently and creatively, ion- a
truly “political” level.’ "I

Local Mitters Try For Sweep
In Season Finale At ‘Wildwood

, -By LARRY HAGGERTY

Coach Bob Lewis’ baseball squad will conclude their 1958
season at Wildwood against the Duquesne Duke on Wednes-
day afternoon. The Panthers will be attempting to sweep the
annual home and home series with Doc Skender’s Dukes.

In the first encounter at Moore F-ield last week, the Blue
and Gold’s Bob Conti won a pitcher’s duel from Fritz Binder
5-1. Conti didn’t allow a hit unti1¢

one Duke was retired in the

eighth inning.

Before meeting the boys from
the Bluff, however, the Jungle
Cats will ﬁrst journey to Kent,
Ohio, to engage the Kent State
nine tomorrow. The Panthers
must win this game if they hope
to receive a tournament bid from

’ the NCAA.

Binder on Mound

Binder will again be Skender’s
choice on the mound Wednesday.
The Duquesne twirler allowed
just seven hits and fanned 16 in
his losing battle against the
Panthers. “I will counter with
either Conti or Bill Hamilton,”
announced Lewis.

The Dukes lineup will proba-
bly show Joel Platt leading on
and playing at second base. The
next two batters will be short-
stop Leo Wilson and Don Takack
who his first sacl-xer. Wilson
homered for the Dukes‘ only run
in the first game.

Hitting in the cleanup position
for the Bluffites will be the cen-
terfielder, Ray DiLallo. Follow-
ing DiLallo will be the thirdbase«-
man, Ed Kaiser. Kaiser will also
serve as Skender’s number one
relief pitcher if needed.

Panther Lineup Set

Rounding out the starting nine
will be leftﬁelder Rege Griﬂfin,
John Thorns, the rightﬁelder and

seventh batter, Catcher George

Sertick and Binder. Takach and
John Buzzi will also be available
for relief duty. ,

The Panther allignment shows
secondbaseman George Schoepp-
ner batting number one in the
order. He will be followed by

 

Ray 
Slugging Duke Outﬁelder

Nick Kartsonas. the centerfield-
er, and Co-captain Jimmy Dun-
lap, the shortstop. Hitting in the
fourth slot will be the other co-
captain, Leftﬁelder Ron Hoover.
The next trio of Panthers will
be Rightﬁelder
Herman Joy, the ﬁrstbaseman,
and the guardian of the ‘hot cor-
ner,” Joe Zoch. . 9

Bluffite Contingent
In Last Home Tilt

Wildwood will be the scene for
the last tennis match of the sea-
son, as' Duquesne, plays the Blue
and Gold this Wednesday. The
ﬁrst set was won by the Panth-
ers 6-3 at Duquesne.

Knobby Knouse remains the
only unbeaten man for the Jungle
Cat Squad. Playing in six out of
the seven Panther games, he has
yet to lose his singles match. In
the Duquesne match, he beat Bill
Goscinski, 7-5, 8-6.

The doubles team of Bill King
and Don Isaacs suffered their
second loss of the season, as
they were trounced by Paul
Koscelnic and Don Rod-zinski,
6-4, 6-3.

The Dukes ﬁrst court man, Paul
Koscelnic took his single from
King, 6-1, 6-2. He also is un-
beaten for the season, but the
Wednesday match “will give King
a chance to seek revenge.

The Duquesne win left the
Panthers with a 7-1 record, los-
ing only to Bucknell. The loss for
the Bluffites gives them a 3-5
chart for the campaign.

C4A’s..

King, Barlifwiéll, Thrash
Hold Key To Track Win

By GEORGE

BURLBAUGH

Panther hopes for a team victory in the IC4A track and
ﬁeld championships opening in New York next Friday will
depend upon whether Mel Barnwell, Wes King, Jay Moody
and Paul Thrash can play “iron—men” and still hit their top
form of the season. Each will probably have to appear in two

or more events.

Barnwell will enter the 100 yard
dash, the 220 yard dash, and the
440 yard dash, or possibly all
three. Coach Carl Olson hinted
that if Barnwell isn’t too tired
after all that running, he may
anchor the mile relay team too.
“It all depends on how the events
are scheduled,” he says. This will
be Barnwel1’s first trip to the
IC4A’s. '

Sprint man Jim Donahue had
an attack of appendicitis last week
and could possibly be lost to the
team. His loss would hurt for he
is one of the squad’s best dash
men. He ﬁnished third in the
100-yard-dash last year behind
Vi1lanova’s Ed Collymore. Colly-
more’s winning time was 0.09:7.
Donahue has run the hundred in

0.09.9 this season.

Moody Enters Dash

Paul Thrash will be running in
the 120 yard high hurdles and the
220 yard low hurdles. His best
times in the two events this year_
are 14.9 in the 120 high hurdles
and 24.4 inthe 220 low hurdles.
The grueling pace that Thrash
will have to set in these two
events to win may keep him out
of the mile relay.

Jay Moody will probably re-
place Jim Donahue in the 100
yard dash and could also be en-
tered in the 220 yard dash and
the 220 low hurdles. Again, this
will depend upon the scheduling
of events.

The Gold and Blue’s mile relay
team, which was the talk of the
country during the indoor season
and a flop when they went out-
side will be a big question mark.
Coach Olson is convinced they
can win but he says that the boys
will have to be fresh. “When we
were at the Penn Relays, the
boys were fresh and full of

A
V

{,.
strength. During the outdoor sea-3
son, they had to spread them-
selves over the other events and
so were tired for the mile relay."
King Tries For Record

It’s not certain yet who Coach
Olsonwill use in the mile relay.
If Barnwell and Thrash are fresh
enough to run, he may use them
teamed up with Vince Wojnar and
either Zinneford Smith or Dick
Doyle. If not, Jay Moody. Tom
Dudas, Dave Kelly or Perry Jones
could step in to ﬁll the gap.

In the ﬁeld events, the Jungle-
cats will of course have Wes
King who holds the school dis-
cus record of 162 -feet 11 inches.
He later topped his own mark at
Notre Dame. with a toss of 165
feet 33/; inches.

4A’s last year with a heave of 158
feet 11/4 inches. Wes will probably
Galso be entered in the shot put
event. ’

Villanova Champs

Regis Goggin will compete in
the broad and high jump. His best
jumps this year were 6 feet 2
inches in the high jump and 22
feet 91/; inches in the broadjump.
Phil Reavis of Villanova won the
high jump last year with a jump
of 6 vfeet 8 inches. Mike Herman
of N.Y.U. leaped 24 feet 31/3 inches

to win the Broad jump crown.
The Panthers this year will be
out to try and break up the
monopoly that Villanova and.

Villanova won the team title by

seven points from Manhatten in

1957. The best the boys from

Skyscraper ‘U. could do was
ninth. '.

Coach Carl Olsen is very em-
phatic about how well he thinks
his team will fare in New York
this year. “I don’t know,” he says.

High Spots Many;
Recognition Given

BY ED KOLTISKA

Sports Editor

By ED KOLTISKA
Sports Editor

For the past few years, it has been the trend for all graduating
Sports Editors to review the high spots in sports that occurred during
their years at Pitt. This year, I would like to deviate from the proce-
dure slightly for the main reason that it is virtually impossible for
me to pick out just a few key events over the past three years.

Every athletic event was a high spot‘ for me regardless of the out-
come. It is the desire and spirit of the competition that counts although

ost people regard only the score as the most ‘important and not how
lit is achieved.

» s 1 During my college career, I have seen many athletes graduate
‘and many morelenter Pitt. I have always wondered why these stu-
dents chose the ﬁeld of athletics and not some other campus activity.
One can little imagine the amount of work that an athlete has to go
‘through just to be prepared for his particular sport. Two to three
hour. practice sessions (some times longer) are scheduled ﬁve days
a Week with the contest slated the sixth. Other hours are spent
,,studying plays and watching movies of competitors for self improve-
ment. Training diets have to be kept and above all scholarship ha

to be maintained. 1

: 7 B To add to this there is always a chance of an injury which can
be costly. But just like the theatre motto “the show must goon,” the
injured athlete comes back for another try risking a re-injury. A good
example of this is gridder Peter Prince. Pete suffered an eye injury
that could have been permanent in the Southern California game last
October. Five months later he’ was ready to don a uniform for spring
practice. ~

Most students believe athletes are below average students with

Tthick skulls who are given special treatment because of their activity.
’(_)n the contrary, the average QPA of all athletes is above average and
Very often no consideration is shown. ’
Looking backiover the past three ‘years, I can now readily un-
derstand why they continue in sports after high school. The tension
before the game, the actual competition, the solemn atmosphere
after a loss, the enjoyment of a victory, and most of all the cheering
student support from the sidelines and few remarks of encourage-
ment after the contest regardless of the outcome are the small things
that mean a lot. Once it gets into your blood it is hard to let go.

I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge some of the
people behind the scenes who are not known by the students but are
close friendsto the athletes (and reporters). Kenny George, Athletic
Business Manager, and his staff are thesmost bothered by athletes
especially for tickets andtﬁnances. .

Two of the most‘ liked persons at the Field House are Trainers
Howard Waite and Roger McGill. These two not only take care of

ﬁruises and pains but also build up good morale. The least known of

all are the athletic managers forthe vairous sports. These students per-
form a variety of functions from tieing shoe laces to. keeping the ath-
letes from losing themselves on trips. Theirs is a thankless job with-
out much renumeration and recognition from the coaches and players
alike, but they still stay on.

Besides the staffs of Athletic Director Tom Hamilton, Graduate
Manager Frank Carver, and the coaches there is one other colorful
ﬁgure who could never be overlooked——Beano Cook. Beano is one of
the best Sports Publicity Directors in the country. He has done such
a ﬁne job that there is not a‘ spot in the United States that has not
heard of Pitt and her athletic teams. ' A ‘

Judicial Body States

 

Policy OnViolations

The newly—elected Interfraternity Judicial Commission
has stated its determination to publicize itself to IFC and the

student body in general.

Members stressed the idea that any complaint about the
conduct of a fraternity or a fraternity man should be brought

before the Commission. 9

This will facilitate any action
that might be forthcoming, for the
Commission has the power to act
in a case of this kind, and if nec-
essary, pass judgment against the
party named. .

The body, consisting of Chair-
man Charles Wittlin, Col. ’59;
, Secretary, James Groninger, Col.
'60; Al Wright, Col. ’59; Gilbert
‘Davis, Col. ’59, and Chris Gil-
lotti, Col. ’60, agreed that in or-
der to function as an. active or-

V , ganization they must be recog-”

nized as the Interfraternity

Council “Court.”

Wittlin explained that when the
Commission was formed in 1956
functioned actively due to’ com-

‘plaints, but last year was seem-

ingly forgotten.

Any violation of University or
IFC rules by a fraternity or fra-
ternity man’ can be reported on
an oﬂicial complaint sheet, ob-
tained from Miss Kielman in the

’ Dean of Men’s Office.

All complaints must be signed
school
days’ of the violation.
