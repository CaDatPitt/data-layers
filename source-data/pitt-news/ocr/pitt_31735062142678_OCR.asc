Pitt Quarterly

Covers Decade

Pitt, the University’s quarterly
magazine, announces that ten
of University _progress,
1936-46, will feature the January
1947 edition. M ’

Edited by Mrs. Agnes L. Starett,
Pitt is dedicated to interpreting
the University. In the January
1947 edition all schools and divi-
sions will be discussed as to their
teaching and research of the past
ten years. d 

To be as detailed as -possible,
the magazine will summarize all
‘activity of the past ten years. This
will include work done during
the war . Contributions,_ including
editorials, have been received by
persons from all units of the Uni-
versity. c

Also to be featured in the bound
edition are ‘ many sphotographs
taken by Mr. Thomas Jaritt, the
school photographer.

Stadium Seats
Are Sufficient

" In answering a. query on the.
crowded students cheering block
by Student Congress, Mr. James

”-Hagan, University athletic direct-

or stated that there are more
seats available at the stadium than
there have beenstudents attend-
ing.

The addition of 30-0-0_ seats this

season has swelled the Student.
seating capacity to 6458 ,seats..

These, Mr. Hagan says, should be
ample. But . . “when three peo-
ple occupy ﬁve seats, then there
must be corners out here and
there.” This necessarily places
spectators in the aisles.

’ At one of the season tilts, 5200‘
students ﬁlled and overﬁowed the
cheering block. This, Mr. Hagan
continues, calls for the coopera-
tion of every student to takeone
seat only. When the attendance
exceeds the ‘seating capacity for
students, the athletic department
will willingly supply the ' pre-
maturely called for seats.

Pep Assembly Chairman

Balahah Heads
Football Rally

In charge of the season’s ﬁrst
football pep rally, -Friday, Octo-
ber’25, is Rudy Balaban, chair-
man of the Assembly committee
of Student Congress. 6

Active’ in the YMCA, Balaban is
a member of the gabinet and of
the Committee of Management.
He belongs to the Pitt marching
band and the concert band, the
men’s glee club and the Photo
club. Rudy also writes for the Owl

staff. A junior majoringﬁin for-

eign languages, he comes from
Arnold, Pa. '

His ﬁrst O iiiterest is the rally,
preceding the Purdue game. “It’s
going to be the~biggest thing to
hit this University since the in-
stitution became co-educational,”
he -‘emphasizes repeatedly.

Balaban has arranged for Coach
Wes Fesler’s ﬁrst appearance be-
forevthe student body at the Pur-
due pep assembly.

The master of ceremonies is»Bob
Prince, Pitt alumnus who appear-

ed at last 'year’s rallies. Prince is

Arthur and student director Tick
-McClintock, will play the ﬁght
songs and the'Alma Mater. Di-
recting the /cheers will be the
University’s ﬁve cheerleaders.

Jack Durishan, senior tackle,

To help the staﬁ to follow its

stressed the importance of stu-
dents ordering their books early.
“Photographs can’t be taken un-
til we know how many are buy-
ing, the books,” he pointed out. “If
the photographs are late, then
the engravings are late. If the en-
gr-avings are late, then the print-
er is thrown off his schedule. The
earlier we know how many books
have been sold, the earlier we
will have the book on campus.”

Obert Reveals
Phi Eta Sigma
Tutor Plans

A tutorial service for the bene-

help with their studies is planned
by the University chapter of Phi

of the group, at its ﬁrst fall meet-
ing last Thursday.

Obert said the tutorial service,
which is free to those students

helped, will work in cooperation
with the faculty and only act in
cases of individual students upon
the recommendations of their in-"
structors. O

Under tentative plans now set
up each member will tutor one
hour each week, probably in his
major ﬁeld.

“Hints on'How to Study,” a
phamplet prepared by the national
headquarters of the organization,
is being distributed to all mem-
bers of the freshman class here.
While not a short cut to high
grades, the booklet offers system.—
atic advice on how any student
canget the most from his studies.
Distribution of this book follows

until Tap’ day next spring. Ned
Mclntosh, faculty advisor, stress-
ed that this average must be ob-
tained for either the ﬁrst semester
or the first year’s work.

At the meeting Gerald Obert
was selected as representative to
attend the national convention of

Owls are strange birds.

They sleep duringithe day and come out only at night.

The 1946 Pitt Owl is an even stranger bird. It made a
great deal of fuss during the day and hasn’t come out at all.
_ There was a time, it is said, when the Owl appeared on the
Pitt campus each spring. In recent years, it has ﬂuttered in,
with its feathers rufﬂed and dusty, some time in the fall.

VVe don’t know when this year’s Owl is going to appear.
Rumor has it that itlwill poke its head out of its nest in an
Ohio print shop some time before the first snow fall. But by
how the whole idea of an 1946 Owl has begun to be regarded.

as rumor.

We kind of like the Owl. He ’s an ample, friendlyokind of
bird. Frankly, we miss him. 'We’ll be glad to see him when-

ever he does come out.

Just now the University ’s student bird fanciers are work-

9 . ing on plans for the appearance of the 1947 Owl. They want to

restore him to his old habits. We think they have a splendid

chance to do so.

, We don’t know just who is to blame for the 1946 Owl .be-
coming a nearly mythical bird. But we’re glad to learn that his
offspring, the 1947 Owl, will show up on time again, his feathers

. well preened, and with no tale of woe to drag behind him.

Confucians I are followers of
Confucius. Could we call us post-
war students Confusions?

The other day a girlie got on an
elevator with a rather dazed ex-
pression on her face. As the door
closed, her face lit up, her eyes

‘ popped. She ran screaming from
the elevator on the first ‘ﬂoor.

Seems her father works for Du-
quesne Light.

Incidentally, the elevator oper-
ators. are trying to convince Stu-

‘dent congress to declare a bounty

onanyone caught riding an ele--
vator for less than ﬁve ﬂoors.
That, at least, would be some sort
of action from the Congress.
This poses a problem though:
What to do with people like
Chuck Carry, Vvho insists on rid-
ing to ﬁve and walking down two

1 flights to‘ get to his third floor

classes. Will they be made to walk
up? Will they. walk if such a rul-
ing is passed, or will they drop

those courses?

Mr. T. C. Campbell would be
happy about any plan that would
lessen the size of his Econ 7 class.
The roll was called the ﬁrst day
as usual. After 20 minutes of
name calling, he asked, “Is there
anyone whose name I did not
cal1?”, A veritable sea of hands
greeted that question.

His retaliation to his sort of
treatment came later when he an-
nounced, with a ﬁendish grin, that

he would look over the assigned-
"text and try to decide whether

or not it w'ould be any good for
the course. He decided it would
be. With the book situation what
it is, he didn’t have much choice.

_One of the menny went into the
bookstore the other day to order
a text of Shakespearian plays He
was told to check back in Decem-
ber—it might be in then. “But you
don’t seem to understand,” he
pleaded, ‘‘I’m taking the course
this semester.” The clerk answer-
ed matter-of-factly, “I know.
Don't worry about it. Shakespeare
is probably a lot easier to under-
stand if you‘don’t read his plays
anyway.”

This turmoil is getting Frank
Willoughby terribly confused. Last
week in physics class, after he

9 and his associates had torn down

all their apparatus, he discovered
that they had forgotten to take
the temperature of the materials
tested. He walked over- to the
equipment shelf and read the
thermometer there. “The temper-
.ature_ is 23.35 degrees.” His re-
sgts, he «says, will probably be. a

little inaccurate———he had to guess
at that last decimal place.

Absolutely ‘the most confused
person in the University is the
lady who has charge of the Tuck
Shop. Last week she was going
around telling people to take their
feet off the seats. _ a

St. Louis has asmoke ordinance.
Now Pittsburgh has a smoke ordi-
nance. The Tuck Shop has smoke.
A galloping poll I have‘ taken in-
dicates that since the smoke ordi-
Lance went into effect it is possi-
ble to turn out the lights in most,
classrooms in the afternoon.

Even the restaurant business is
affected. One downtown eaterie
featuring a sandwich called the
Pittsburgher. It’s made of smok-
ed ham on burned toast. They
don’t burn the toast now, but they
have substituted smoked herring
—for obvious reasons. It is billed
now as Pittsburgher, a la Truman.

With strikes and work, stop-
pages the order of the day, it is
encouraging to hear of a back-to-
work movement. That seems to be

what we have on a small scale ..

here at Pitt. Dala Moore some
time ago was advised to get a job

of work Where she could mingle .

with the masses. She got a job
modeling at Kaufmar_in’s. Well,
maybe the patrons of those fash-

ion shows are masses. I wouldn’t ‘

know. Apparently Dala is ‘still

following that (advice. She is back I

here close to the maddening
throng again. ‘
' Also, we have with us Dorothy
Anthony. D. A., after graduating
in June, found, that people on the
outside kept offering her jobs.
That convinced her that she need-
ed some more psychology, so back
she came.

Accroding to Pitt-pourri, I in-
spire people-—or rather Catrow
and Thompson. He says the stu-
dent body deserves something
better than this colyumnut pro-
vides. Well, we’re still waiting,
fellas. That’s the end of this week
little effort. '

By Pat Eldridge

Senorita Fanny Izikson of San-
itago, Chile, is so enthusiastic
about her life as a social worker
that she has traveled over 5000
miles to study in the School of
Applied Social Sciences at the
University. But social work is not
her only reason for coming to
North America.

Just like many of us who dream
of going to South America, Fanny
dreamed of visiting our northern
continent. The Wanderlust is in
her blood. Fanny’s father, who
lived in Russia, and her mother,
who lived in Rumania near the
Russian border, wanted to visit
Chile on their honeymoon. They
did, and liked Chile so well that
they’ve lived there ever since.

Senor Iziks-on is an insurance
agent in Santiago. “My mother,”

Fanny says, “does . .” (her eye-
brows knit in concentration to
find the right word) . . . “My

mother does home work! In Chile
we like very much her home
work.” . —

Fanny’s life at home in San-
tiago is very much similar to the
life we know in our North Ameri-
can homes. Perhaps- in Latin
America the families are closer,
perhaps meals are served at dif-
ferent times. But you could easily
take the large white stucco home
at 750 Vicuna Mackenna in San-
tiago to be your own. You could
recognize the green lawn and the
ﬂower garden in the back yard as
one you worked in yourself. I

“We live just two hours from
the sea,” Fanny says, “and it is
just like yours.” She adds, “We
used to spend the summers there.”

“But we do not spend all of our
time as easily as you think we do.
We hurry too,” she admits. “Sies-
tas,” she waves her hand to erase
them from the picture, “are a
thing of the colonial times.” In
fact,’ Fanny’s working hours are
longer than ours.

She’s -out of bed at 7:45 in the
morning, has 1-er breakfast, and is
ready to leave for work. Saysshe,
“Either I‘ go with-my father in
his car, I take the bus, or I ride
the streetcar.”

In Latin America, everyone
goes home at noon for the largest
meal of the day. In an hour Fan-
ny’s back at work at _the Pob-
lacion Aranco, a housing project
in Santiago. Her working day ends
at six.

“We have our evening supper

around nine — everyone does --

and then we go for walks, to the
movies, or to the concerts.” Peo-
ple in Chile are very fond of
music. Fanny is anxious to hear
the Pittsburgh Symphony orches-
tra, for the Izikson’s have some
of‘ its,recordings in their ‘collec-
tion at home.

In a year when Fanny returns
to "Santiago, she will have much
to tell her family about North
American ways. She will not only
have much to tell, she will have
much to do. For Fanny Izikson
has come to North America for a
purpose -— to accumulate experi-
ence and information that will
later help her in social work in
her native_ land.

quarter miles. Because of changes
_in the course a good comparison
cannot be made, but Coach Olson
is” quite sure that Sudzina ran
one of the fastest races ever run
over the Schenlcy Park course.

The Case squad made '— serious
error when they tried to run the
race without even making an in-
spection of the course.

Churchill, the Case distance
star, stumbled and fell on one
of the hills and he had to be as-
sisted from the course. The second
place runner for Case made a bad
turn and got lost in Schenley
Park. If these men had ﬁgured in
the scoring, the meet would have
been much closer.

Panthers Edge
Out Marquette
On Extra Point

Lou Cecconi’s all important
point after touchdown was the
deciding factor, when Pitt met
Marquette for the ﬁrst time in
their grid careers, at the stadium
last Saturday. afternoon;

The Golden Avalanche. scored
ﬁrst. A long sky-high pass, late in
the second period, carried for a
touchdown. This culminated a
Marquette drive from their own
31 yard line. The try from place-
ment went wide, a fatal blow to
the visitors.

A. pass -was also the Panthers’
road to score. Carl DePasqua fad—_
ed back ‘and hit Leo Skladany
with a wobbly heave and the Pitt
end stretched over the goal for
the six-pointer. Cecconi hustled oﬁ
the bench to apply the ﬁnishin
touch. .

A perplexing Black and Gold /squad from Lafayette, Indiana,
will invade Pittsburgh Saturday seeking to perpetuate the jinx which;
Western Conference foes exercise over the Panthers. ' ,
Far from being the powerhouse predicted by mid-western fans,
Purdue has been used as a doormat by Iowa, Illinois, and Notre,
Dame. Weakened by the loss of three star performers, the .B.oiler-,
makers have ﬂoundered miser-xv i
ably since the opening win over
Miami (Ohio).
Opponents Score At Will

In four games to date the Cecil
Isbell coached eleven has permit-
ted a total of 115 points. Illinois
and Notre Dame were the worst
offenders. \The Irish triumphed,
49-6, and the Illini applied a 43
-——7 shellacking. A

Bob (Stormy) Pfhol, lialfback
with the Kings Point Merchant
Marine eleven last year, is out
for the season. Injuries to Bill
Canﬁeld, top receiver in the West-
ern Conference for 1945, deprive
the Boilermakers of their most
capable halfback. '

Injuries ‘Stall’ Offense s

Quarterback Bob DeMoss was
sidelined following the Illinois
massacre. With the sophomore
from Dayton, Kentucky, on’ the
bench, Purdue loses 50 per cent
of its offense. As a freshman
against Western Conference foes,
he completed 38 of 79 passes,
good for 487 yards.

Ed Cody, veteran fullback, has
failed to match his devastating
1945 pace. Accorded All-Confer-
ence honors, Cody was runner-up
on net gains by rushing and stood
third in total offense.

Ed Ehlers, better known for his
basketball and baseball ability,
has been a dependable halfback
in his ﬁrst season of collegiate
ball. ‘ v .
The Boilermakers played one of
their better games of the season
Saturday in tying Ohio ‘State, 14-

it in the Pre—Med Forum, Dr. H. C.
 Carlson, head of Men’s Health ser-
‘ vice and Pitt basketball mentor,
said that being a doctor, although
it is a never ending job, has both
spiritual and ﬁnancial beneﬁts.
The Forum met Friday, October

18, at 12:30 p. m. in 144 C1. Ber-
nard Leftowitz, represented the
YMCA and introduced the speak-
 _er. .
1 Dr. Carlson mentioned some

things which are required of a

doctor. “You must like people!”
he said, f‘and be willing to sac-
riﬁce your time. Have faith in
people, believing what they tell
you.” His ﬁnal point was that the
successful doctor is not a money
chaser, but a friend to his patients.
