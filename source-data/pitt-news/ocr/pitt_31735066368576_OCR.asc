Although many students have been known to not spring
clean, this man has to clean the windows of the Scaiie
Museum to make it presentable to the public. I

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The Office of Student Activities
has developed a proposal that it says
will clearly define the relationships
between the university and student
organizations on campus. .

Appropriately called the Student
Organization Certification Policy,
the proposal would allow students
to freely form groupseand would
allow the university to decide which

- organization it wants to officially

sponsor.

The proposal distinguishes two
types of certification-—registered
student organizations and recog-
nized student organizations.

Registered student organizations
will be considered as private afﬁlia-
tions of the university. For example,

a basket weaving club. might‘ be.

known as “as registered student
organization at the University of
Pittsburgh."

Associate Director of Student
Activities and the main researcher
and writer of the proposal Terrence
Milani said the policy would give
student organizations “total free-
dom to operate and exist as long as
they meet the conditions outlinediin
the policy.”

The procedures for registration
are basically the same as the existing
policies: a group must submit a
membership roster of at least 10

members or a petition signed by 100
students who support the, organiza-
tion. The group must also provide to
the Office of Student Affairs a list of
officers in good academic standing,
the name of an adviser, a disclosure
of any outside affiliations and a con-
stitution and bylaws.

The registered student groups
must also abide by university regula-
tions and local, state and federal
laws. These groups would be
allowed to use university equipment,
receive funds and receive other privi-
ledges stated in the policy.

Recognized status would grant a
student organization official status
in ‘the eyes of the university’s educa-
tional or extra-curricular programs.
For example, the Student Govern-
ment Board would be known as “the
University of Pittsburgh Student
Government Board.”

The vice-chancellor for student
affairs, through the Office of Stu-
dent Activities,‘ would decide which
extra-curricular organizations
would receive recognition status. In
the case of academic groups, the
dean of the school or college would
make the decision.

In order to apply for recognition,
an organization must first meet the
criteria of the registration status and
then petition a “line officer”to gain
the status.

Milani said that the research for
the new policy took two years to

frlday, March 25, 1983

 

A - Organization Policy Developed

complete and that the policies of 65
other schools on student activities
were studied. The policy has since
gone through the various adminis-
trative and legal channels, and the
three student government bodies-

the Student Government Board, the S

College of General Studies Student
Cabinet and the Graduate Student
and Professional Association—are
currently discussing thepolicy with
their members and will make any
suggestions or recommendations.
The policy is needed, Milani said,
because there is currently no written

policy to distinguish groups. The V _

way it is done now. the SGB decides
which‘ groups to recognize, no mat-
ter if they are academic, extra-
curricular, CGS or GSPA
organizations.

Under the new policy, the SGB
will decide which groups to fund
with the Student Activities alloca-
tions, depending on the status of

each group.
Student Activities Director.Andy
Smith said the policy will alleviate

some problems that the office cur- i

rently experiences. For example, the
office will know who the officers and
the advisers of an organizationgare
and how to get in contact with them.
He said the office hopes to get the.
new policy off the ground sometime
in December and emphasized that
all organizations would be made
aware of the plan before it is
enacted.

CivilRights Still Have A Long Way To Go, King Says

By D.J. CASE

The Civil _Rights Movement
achieved more progress during the
1960s than in the last four centuries,
but it still has a long way to go,
Coretta Scott King told a full house
last night in. David Lawrence
Auditorium.

Reiterating the non-violent phil-
osophies of her late husband, her"
lecture, “Charting A Non-Violent
Course: The Legacy of Martin
Luther King, Jr.,” touched on the
accomplishments of the great civil
rights leader and outlined a course
by which those accomplishments
must be extended.

“The non-violent philosophy and
strategy that Martin Luther King,
Jr. embraced and the lessons. of the
Civil Rights Movement provide the
key to solving a host of social and
economic crises we face today,"
King said, emphasizing that by using
a strategy of non-violence, blacks
were able to achieve an effective
legislative guarantee of democratic
rights in the form of the Voting
Rights Act of I965, but there are still
many things to be changed. “Forced
racial segregation ‘has been nearly

eliminated, but discrimination
remains yet to be eradicated."

One of the reasons for the contin-
uance of racism, violence and pov-
erty is silence—-the silence of good
people.

. “There are good people who are
indifferent to poverty because they
are too. tired or too afraid. There are
good people who fail to speak out
when their taxes are used to drop
bombs on unarmed civilians in for-
eign lands because they feel power-
less before their government. The
time is fast approaching when we
can no longer afford this luxury."

.» King said the way to effect apro-

gressive change in society is through
political involvement.

“Almost every issue that affects
young people can be impacted
through greater political involve-
ment," she said. The military draft,
correcting environmental pollution,
high unemployment and the nuclear
arms race will all require a greater
involvement in politics by concerned
young people. “Young people
played a crucial role in the Civil
Rights and Peace Movements of the
’60s, and they can make the differ-
ence in the struggles ofthis decade.”

“You can’t all be Martin Luther
King, .lr.’s," she said, “but you can

all be yourselves, and you can give
all that you have to give. Never lose
faith, never lose hope. Dream
dreams. Dream even impossible
dreams but make sure you go out
and work for the fulfillment of those

dreams..."

She concluded by reading a
speech of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s
that she said is still relevant today.
“During these days of human tra-
vail, we must encourage creative ais-

senters. We need them because the
thunder of their fearless voices will
be the only sounds stronger than the
blasts of bombs and the clamor or
war hysteria. We still have a choice
today....”

By ANN WALKER

it is not unusual to see college

students waiting in long lines to

purchase concert tickets, but stu-

' dents camping outside of Thack-

eray Hall to register is an odd
sight.

Lines started forming at 8:30
p.m. on Sunday, March 20, and
by opening time, I55 students
were patiently waiting in the
hallway.

Madalyn Greenlee, manager
of the Registration Office, said
that this is a fairly new
phenomenon--stemming from
students’ concern, with getting
particular courses. The majority
of the students was waiting in
line to register for computer
courses, according to Greenlee. ‘

Fall Registration BringsLong Lines

“Students want to be the first
to register so they can get those
courses they want. Their choices
become limited as the registra-
tion process continues," Green-
lee said.

To prepare for the influx of
students, Greenlee brought in
temporary help to aid the nine
regular registration clerks. Dur-
ing the peak period (Monday
through Wednesday), a total of
17 people helped students \with .
registration.

“We assisted l,438 students on
Monday, l,l5l on Tuesday and
l,l56 on Wednesday." Greenlee
said. “At the staff meeting on
Friday, we planned for this rush.
We were prepared to help that
many people.“

The office was planning ‘to
open at 7:30 a.m., an hour earlier

than usual, but a computer ter-
minal problem delayed the open-
ing until 8 a.m. Lunch hours
were shortened to provide'maxi-
mum service for the students,
Greenlee said. Greenlee said that
students were more polite than
usual and there weren’t many
problems because the Registra-
tion Office had been preparing
for weeks.

“We're used to the first few
days of registration, but this
year, with students lining up at
8:30 p.m. Sunday night, was
exceptional,” Lynne Boehme, a
registration clerk, said. “I was
shocked to see that many stu-
dents there so early."

Ed Petros, a senior psychology
major who decided to brave the
first day of registration, said that
he only had to wait about halfan

Forum:

 

By JOHN HOUSTON

The past decade has brought
news that the SAT scores of the
incoming freshmen have been drop-
ping lower with each new school
year. College administrators have
been stating that the quality of the
incoming freshmen is not
decreasing, but rather, the accuracy
of the SAT‘has been proven to be
limited and the SAT score is only

useful as a supplement to the whole

picture; *

With those conﬂicting reports in
mind, this week's Forum deals with
these questions: ls the quality of
education high enough at Pitt? Are
the incoming freshmen competent
or is the university lowering its
standards in order to keep up
enrollment?

Irwin Schulman,
CA8 Dean

lrwin Schulman, dean of the Col-

lege of Arts and Sciences (CAS),
said the quality of education at Pitt is
not being compromised for higher
enrollment ﬁgures. While a number
of educationally disadvantaged stu-
dents are admitted, he said, for the
most part, the students are able to
do the required work.

Schulrnan also said that while the
quantity of students is important,
the caliber of those students has
remained constant, so the overall
quality of education has not been
compromised. ln fact, with the new
curriculum reform requirements
that are being instituted in CAS, the
quality of education will rise, he said.

AlthoLrgh there is an economic
aspect to consider and the univer-
sity must accept some of the less
qualiﬁed students who do apply,
Schulrnan stated that the university
has maintained its standards as a
selective institution. He said Pitt
cannot hope for the ideal because it
is not a school like Harvard and,
therefore. cannot be nearlyas selec-

Many with w/w carpeting, double showers & sinks, air
conditioning, separate thermostatic controls, desks, inter-

tive. This means that Pitt does have
to athrit a nunber of students with
academic problems.

Alec Stewart.
(lnlverslty Honors
Program Director

Alec Stewart, director of the uni-'
versity honors program. said the

’ trend in the program over the last

few years has been toward an
increased ability among students in
program. ’

Stewart said he has also seen a
great increase in the number of
exceptional students who are apply-
ing to the university. This year, 30
National Merit Semifinalists have
already applied to the school, an
increase over last year.

Students are now more attuned
to academic interests, and more stu-
dents are taking the harder classes.

Advising is crucial to the mainte-
nance of the level ‘of education at
Pitt, and the cuts in the advising
areas of the university, hurt

much more than the administration
thought when it decided to cut the
budget, Stewart said. He sais that
because the success of the advising
program cannot be quantified, peo-
ple tend to dismiss the importance
of it.

Peter Holland,
Psychology Professor

Peter Holland, a psychology pro-
fessor, said that while he sees a
number of students in his classes
who are not capable of doing the
work, most are. He said that over
the last couple of years, the writing
ability and overall skill level of stu-
dents has increased.

While he would like to see the
requirements raised, Holland said
he realized that the abilities of the
majority of students would not allow
this to happen. /

Holland blames the university for

.6" s The Quality of   Education High Enough At Pitt?

creating some of the problems it
faces. One way that problems were
created, he said, is through the use
of lecture classes with over3(X) stu-
dents. Holland said he believes such
classes may cause a good student to
be pulled down by the less moti-
vated students around him because
the teacher really has no way to con-

trol these less motivated students I

while they were in class.

Holland also said many students
are not motivated, and that is where
the g reatest problem arises; In many
cases, he said, the level _of motiva-
tion in a student is more of a decid-
ing factor than his mental ability.

Holland said that while some stu-
dents are not really prepared for col-
lege, the solution rests with Pitt. The
study habits that students possess
may be deficient,_but they can be
raised to acceptable levels by the
university. But most of those who
need the most help lack the motiva-
tion to go out and seek the study
habit workshops, he said.

Complaints
And

    Criticisms

Actions speak louder than words. That cliche
has begun to haunt an unlikely pair: Pitt’s Stu-
dent Government Board (SGB) and the Catholic
Church. A ‘

In some observers’ eyes, the actions of those
two groups (or more fairly, of some of their
members) have not measured up to their
promises—their words. This has made the church
and the SGB the subjects of some criticism. And
neither the Catholics nor the SGB is takingit
lying down. I

The Student Government Board has com-
plained repeatedly /this term about being critic-

ized, particularly for its frequent trips to

out-of-town conferences.

The U.S. Catholic Conference is crying “bad
taste” in response to ABC Television’s plans to
begin on-Palm Sunday a 10-hour mini series
based on Colleen McCullough’s novel “The
Thorn Birds,” which features a priest’s love affair
with an Australian woman. The church feels that
scheduling the, show on a religious holiday is “an
affront to» religious sensibilities.”

Subjects of criticism—in this case the Catholic
Church and the SGB—gain nothing by merely
complaining about the fate of their public image.
Complaining certainly -won’t help their public
images since those who are inclined to believe the
criticism won't change their minds simply
because they are told to. Instead, the proper
responses to criticism are either to show that it is
unfair by giving a justification for the challenged
actions or to stop doing them if they are
unjustifiable.

By failing to give a proper response to the
criticism they have received, the U.S. Catholic

‘Conference and the SGB give the public the

impression that they do not care about .the right-

_ ness of their members’ actions. This is very sur-

prising for two groups whose very existence is
devoted, in theory, to doing the right thing.

The church, of course, does not have to justify
its actions to men, only to God. For the Student
Government Board, it’s a different story. The
SGB is accountable to all undergraduates at Pitt.
If the SGB believes that it has been unfairly critic-
ized, it needs to convince its constituents of that.
If the SGB has acted improperly, it should take
action to mend its ways.

After all, actions speak louder than words.

The Pitt News, Friday March 25, 1983

- Letters To The Editor

Abortion: Keep Talking

Dear Editor:

In response to the March 4, 1983,
letter concerning “the abortion con-

_ troversy,” I would like to say that it

is not true that it’s time for those
opposed to abortion to shut up.
Would you have told those trying
to inact anti-slavery legislation to
back off? Would you also tell those
of us who are struggling to block the
foreign policy enacted by our
government which results in and
encourages murder, torture and
starvation in Latin America to let
the law be; what has been decided

A has been decided?

When the law results in the
oppression and destruction of
humans who are not powerful or
vocal enough to compete with or
defend themselves against those who
maintain control over their exist-
ence, others will rise to their defense.

‘This is called social action or fight-

ing for justice and peace, and it
involves a lot more areas than just
Third World oppression.

In rising to the defense of the
unborn, I first of all challenge all
pro-choicers to take an honest look
at all sides of the argument; not just
the side which seems the most pro-
gressive or “liberal.” I, once being a
pro-choicer, did just that, and found

overwhelming evidence in support

of the pro-life perspective.

I must admit that holding the
opinion that abortion is similar to
ending the life ofa six-year-old child
is not consistent with my very liberal
views politically and economically,
but then again, being a so called “lib-
eral” and condoning abortion is a
contradiction.

An individual who can look at the
long range implications of institu-
tions, policies or laws and see inade-
quacy or harm which can result, and
then decide to change or not imple-
ment those institutions, policies or
laws, is acting on intelligent, com-
passionate, logical decision-making,
and not quick-fix, quick-buck, self-
ish goals. For example, some who
choose to look may be familiar with
the harmful aspects of pure capital-
ism. Within this system, individuals
obtain things of value through their
ability and success in competing for
them.

The facts are, there will be those
who will not or cannot succeed in
this competition; there will be those
with little or no food, clothes, health
care and homes. People who have

' lbbkéd "ﬁnd ’s'eeI’I'1'h”i$ ‘reality have

done several things: they have closed
their eyes to the painful results and
continued the competition while
fighting programs and legislation
that would take away from them to
provide for the “less fortunate”; they
have continued the competition
while encouraging legislation which
will provide more economic leveling
or a more just economic structure;
or they may have chosen an alterna-
tive economic system all together.

The so called “liberals” usually
consider the last two choices. These
choices, on a personal level, show
concern, compassion, empathy and
unselfishness to those who bear the
brunt of others’ greed. The liberals
have seen long term harm which will
result and have chosen either against
it or to alter it.

Abortion has to be viewed in the
light or long-range implications on
society also. This is where liberal
views and the support of abortion
become contradictory.

When we base a decision in favor
of abortion on the short-term
euphemisms such as, “Every woman
has a right to control her own body,”

“Every child a wanted child” or»

“Freedom of choice,” we are making

‘a decision based on quick-‘fix, selﬁsh

goals.

I agree that lives could be much
easier and lots of money could be
put to “more important use” if
babies that are known to be
deformed could be aborted. That
also includes rape pregnancies and
teenage pregnancies. Let’s also con-
sider the cost-time efficiency and
emotional burden which can be app-
lied to other dependents such as old
people, the terminally ill, invalids
and the mentally retarded. And the
list goes on. Where do we draw the

‘ line?

Mentally and physically
deformed babies have been and are
being allowed to die after birth by
not being provided with food and
medical care need to sustain their
lives. Even babies who are aborted
by hysterotomy (late-term babies
lifted through a surgical cut) and
survive are left to die.

The long term implications are
that when the power of life or death
decisions are given to individuals for
their own convenience (abortion),
we are then publicly and privately
less likely to maintain the standards
for guaranteeing life to individuals
who are emotional and economical

inconveniences (old people, invalids
V.  .. ..,, , , I V A b

A perfect example of this pattern
is the euthanasia carried out by the
German government during World
War 11. Many people think legalized
abortion is the first step towards
gradual adoption of euthanasia
practices in the United States. They
may be right because it’s already
happening (see “Handbook On
Abortion” by Dr. and Mrs. J.C.
Willke).

We are so quick to cite the U.S.
Constitution and Bill of Rights
when we’re trying to support some-
thing of which we’re in favor, but
when those amendments make state-
ments that will refute decisions
we’ve made and hold, we choose to
close our eyes and ears or manipu-
late the statements so our positions
aren’t threatened.

One of the amendments being
manipulated in this case is the right

ot life. Yes, I and many others ‘i

believe that what some choose to
euphemistically call “eight-celled
embryos" or “pregnancy matter" is
life, human life. Is a child more
human than a toddler? Is an adult
more human than a child? Is an
adult more human than a first tri-
mester baby? I and many others say
no. They are all human beings but in
different stages of development.

So, we can continue to manipu-
late words in pursuit of our own
interests (something we've been
blaming the U.S. government for
doing with the Salvadorian/ Central
American situation.) We can con-
tinue to lie to ourselves and others
andvhide the facts from them as we
encourage abortion; then -we can
blame the guilt these women expe-
rience on the “sick fundamentalist
pro-lifers." That is when we would
be hiding the facts from ourselves,
because the guilt these women expe-
rience is a result of their realization;
of what actually took place or is tak-
.ing place. And heaven forbid‘that we
should replace a lie with the truth.

When we attend demonstrations
against certification of aid to El Sal-
vador or when we write our repre-
sentatives concerning the same issue
or save the whales and protect baby
seals, remember the destruction and
oppression that is taking place right
in our own city, and then listen to the
silence around you and understand
that, as a result, the day may come
when not even you will be guaran-
teed the right to life.

Protecting A Free And Open Society

By TOM WANKO

Across the country, federal, state and uni- -.

versity administrations are cutting pro-
grams, departments and faculty members in
the area of liberal arts. Here at Pitt alone the
geography department has been closed,
funding for the Women's Center eliminated
and Dean Rosenberg is currently proposing
the termination of anywhere from 33 to 53
members of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences.

Does liberal arts education still serve a
purpose? It's a timely and relevent question.

Education in the liberal arts serves in the
main line of defense for protectinga free and
open society. It is through the process of
examining broad and varied topics in . a
mode of verbal and written interchange with
respected professionals that new and innov-
ative concepts can be perceived and
examined.‘ '

The existence of liberal arts programs
gives us the chance to realize and expose the
folly of narrow and dangerous ideas such as
racism, anti-Semitism and fascism. If and
when liberal arts programs are narrowed, so
are our options. Intolerance and fear will
move to ﬁll the voids.

Many critical and troublesome questions

are being answered in our name today. The-.

ability to gauge facts, review options and
choose priorities is indispensable in a world

becoming more complex and increasingly
fluid. We cannnot allow ourselves to regress
into reactionary and myopic policies which
stifle and suffocate.

As liberal arts programs are cut and elimi-
nated, our abilities as a democratic society to
fully and openly debate vital issues will dim-
inish. Without liberal arts programs, how
will we be able to critically consider if the
government has: the “right” to spy on its
citizens, the “right” to censor ideas not keep-
ing within its line or the “right” to use its
citizens as hostages in a game of nuclear
intimidation?-These issues as well as others
are -beingdecided on now.

implemented by executive order, these
“security” organizations will be allowed to
spy on such subversives as anti-nuclear
groups and organizations against interven-
tion in El Salvador. Citizenswho are con-
cerned about military intervention and
nuclear holocaust have now come under sus-
picion for their “dissenting” beliefs.

Ask yourself why the Reagan Administra-

‘tion refused to allow Salvador Allende’s
widow into the country for a series of’

appearances and speaking engagements?

tration’s justification; her views would be
“prejudicial to United States’ interests.”,
Likewise, the administrtion’s directive to
label propaganda three Canadian films, two
on acid rain and one on nuclear war, are part
of the continuing effort to repress views that

diverge from government policy.

Further, not only is dissent on U.S. policy
banned from abroad, but it is also coming
under fire at home. The Reagan Administra-
tion has classified domestic and foreign
opponents of their nuclear arms policy into
one category; radicals and subversives on
the side of evil (that can only mean Russia)
out to destroy that which is good (our
nuclear weapons buildup) who are under-
mining the administration’s path of right-
eousness and truth. Why does the
administration feel it is necessary to circum-
vent or ignore ideas which are different from
its own? '

Throughout this decade and into the next,
liberal arts must continue to promote debate
on all the options open to us. We must not
allow ourselves to be duped into accepting
ideas which are made to sound good but
contain no substance, save for that which
will benefit those few with vested interests.
Pitt, as well as other universities, must rise to
meet the challenge of providing a quality

‘ liberal arts curriculum to as large a cross-

section of society as possible.

At the same time, it must avoid the pitfalls
of quick-ﬁx budget cuts. There are anumber,

I .

of different ways this could be accomp- I

lished: a temporary freeze on new construc-
tion and renovation till such time that the
economy has recovered from its current cri-
sis; public review and debate on the cur-
rently proposed budget to determine if waste
and abuse can be eliminated; or maybe many
of the members on the Board of‘Trustees'at
Pitt since "they also sit as board members on
many of the local corporations, could see

their way fit to defer acceptance of their
salaries until recovery has brought prosper-

ity ‘back to our area.

Why shouldn’t every one take an equal

share of the burden? Tuition, hikes bypass

the wealthy and target those most in need of
seeing their educations continue. In the same I

vein faculty membe s a d k
' , r n service wor ers

shouldn't be made to bear the burden of

continuing budget cuts. The time has come
to look for other options and create new

theories in the struggle to promote higher

education for all Americans.

It will be without well-rounded liberal arts
education‘that we will lose sight of what’ is

possible for society to achieve. In a recent ,

article on liberal arts, it was proposed that
education as “a theory is like a pair of specta-
cles;,you examine things by it, and your
knowledge of it lies in this very use of it.”

The time has come to buy a new pair of
glasses, for our near-sightedness continues
to grow worse.

ff the New Left

By scorr MERVIS

Andy Gill at center stage stares down the audience, not really seeing
them, or needing to. The guitar, an extension of his body, begins to jerk and
sway. His movements are instinctive, involuntary, as are the rhythms of a
person catching his breath. Like an engine, the band ignites. The momen-
tum it builds seems almost dangerous. They hold themselves up by bounc-
ing off each other, seeking a reason or a clue in every corner of the stage.
The beat is strong and danceable, but Gill disrupts and re-directs it, slashing
his guitar against the foundation. Reason struggles but surrenders. Confu-
sion leads to dance, and dance into more confusion.

Singer Jon King moves like a man trying to keep from drowning or maybe
keep from thinking. His lyrics parallel the music. Every verbal direction he
takes is another trap—another vehicle toward indecision: ”This wheel spins let
me off/It's not the lack of trying/Can't put my finger on it/You can't help being hard
up/Can't trust the God we trusted/Don't think that's any insurance." The vocals weave
in and out of each other. Gill dashes to the mike to make a comment and
then retreats, as King is lost in his own torrent of lyrics, which are over-
taken by the chorus, powered by bassist Sara Lee.

This is Gang Of Four——a band whose intense on-stage performances are
surpassed only by the intensity of their political ideologies. For six years,
the group has challenged musical consciousness with their violently cere-
bral "think" music and primal sounds. Now, with the band's unlikely dance
floor hit, '’I Love A Man In Uniform,” their audience is growing and so is
Gang of Four—they have a lot to say in both their music and their words.

Backstage, the enthusiastic King explains: ”We are quite old-fashioned in
that we are a guitar-oriented band. A lot of these boring, I mean, a lot of
these new wave acts—they write a record on their little drum machine or
synthesizer—-they've got no reason to want to go out to the people and put
their ideas over. I would say that we are definitely the best live act." He
laughingly continues, "I mean if you ever go to a synthesizer gig———some
bloke standing on this little square thing—-my God, it's boring. You might
as well not bother really. You might as welljust have the record. There's no
need to go and see a Soft Cell concert."

Beneath their rather manic stage demeanors, Leeds graduates Ion King
and Andy Gill are very friendly and soft-spoken men with a preoccupation
with politics. A frequent subject in the backstage interview was the incor-
poration of politics into rock 'n' roll and the various misconceptions that
often arise from it. Gill is politely reproachful when asked about the band's
relationship to The Clash as purveyors of Marxism: "Our conceptual basis
is located in a left-wing tradition," he says, "Marx figures only somewhat
theoretically. As far as The Clash is concerned, I've always been at a loss to
understand why people talk of them as political. Not to put them down, but
I just don't see it. That first album was their most extreme, and that was

really songs which were largely about malcontent and boredom——a very"

London kind of thing."

As on the stage, King would intervene to elaborate: "In the end, what the
American government often says and what the British do, as well, is that if
you don't agree with them, then you must be a subversive...Anything
which doesn't sound like it's sponsored by the McDonalds corporation is
labelled Marxist," he says smiling, ”We are not a Marxist band, but we are a
leftist band."

How does a band like Gang of Four reconcile themselves with an industry
that is dependent upon the sales of records and $9.00 T—shirts.7 King is
familiar with the subject: "Sometimes people have a misguided idea of what
leftism is. They say, ’If you're a good leftist, how come you don't give your
records away?’ which is a really sort of weird idea. It's obvious that when we
record something, we know it's got to be sold because it's got to be paid for.
The difference between making something to sell and deliberately making a
commerical product is a world apart. We are projecting our own ideas, but
we know that it's going to be sold," he says.

 

Pix By Butch Belair

What has always been striking about Gang of Four is the way they
approach the selling of their product and the image that is conveyed in the
process. On their three albums and two EPs, nowhere is there to be found a
picture of the band. In fact, it is not until their latest album, Songs Of The Free,
that they reveal who plays what instrument. These idiosyncracies suggest
that the band members are subordinate to the songs. Greil Marcus once
said that it seems, when watching Gang of Four, as if the songs play them,
rather than them playing the songs. The musicians come off as being
anonymous individuals, leaving the songs free of rock—star hype. "The
normal mode," Gill says, "is the star figure who uses songs as a part of his or
her commercialization. They write about whatever it is they feel is going to
promote them. Whereas, our songs sort of exist as entities in and of
themselves." King again breaks in, displaying his unique way with words:
"We didn't enter into this to become personalities. I have absolutely no
desire to be taken by someone on the street and asked, 'Hey, aren't you in
the thing?’ "

Although they are political, Gang of Four songs never speak of politics.
"We are not politicians," King says, "and we are not out there selling an

WOOD PINUP
Commentary by Tony Crawley
Delilah Books

"Movie stars and starlets carryan

During Hollywood's Golden Age,

" the movie studios catered to this love

affair. They sent out thousands of
‘pinups of the stars for publicity
exposure. Newspapers and maga-
zines printed them, and the public
obligingly tacked them up on the
walls and worshipped. Rita Hay-
worth, Lana Turner and lane Russell
did the pinup bit, showing what they
had as far as the censors would allow,
and so did the men (except they called

MORNING?
By Frances Farmer
Dell

Frances Farmer has been news
lately. A long-forgotten actress who
had a short career on stage and in the
movies, she spent 1945 to 1950 in a
state insane asylum, mostly in the
violent ward. She was high-strung,
private and quick-tempered, cer-
tainly. Insane? Doubtful.

Will There Really Be A Morning? is
Frances Farmer's autobiography, a
new edition brought out to coincide
with the recent television film. It's
impossible to know if the original

Showcase, Friday March 25, 1983

M manuscript ohe book has ver been

tampered with, since it was origi-
nally published in 1972, two years
after ‘her death from cancer‘. But
what's here is literally a "can’t put it
’down” self-exploration of a beautiful
and talented actress who refused to
conform to "HolIywood’s unreal
world of song and dance and horse-
kissing cowboys.”

Mother, "my own personal ]udas,"
had Frances committed to the insti-
tution. Mrs. Farmer was a hysterical,
outspoken, publicity-minded cru-
sader with fanatical ideas of proper
daughterhood. Mr. Farmer was inef-
fectual and largely absent, and Fran-
ces was an unwanted child. "On this

erratic family tree, I hung suspended
and adjudged insane,” she writes.

"But one does not ‘go crazy’ in a day
or two. And one does not end up in an
asylum overnight." Will There Really
Be A Morning? details the incredible
personal and professional tension
that led to her near-nervous break-
down and her incarceration in a pri-
vate hospital in 1943, following a
drunken driving charge, and in a
Washington state asylum from/1945
to 1950.

Up to a point, the memories are
clear, as Miss Farmer outlines the
filth and torture to which she and
other inmates had been subjected
during the five years--questionable
experimental treatments, repeated
rape, straitjackets, tainted food, rats
and more. Hate and ”beIligerent,
rebellious energy" got her through
it. She summarizes much of her con-
finement, confessing "great gaps” in
her recall (she might have been lobo-
tomized as part of a test). The details
remaining are _vivid, and the writing
is ’magnetic, matter-of-fact and
minus the expected self-pity.

Following her parole from the asy-
lum in 1950, Frances Farmer wan-
dered through various cities, jobs
and bouts with alcoholism; she
finally attempted to resume her act-
ing career, achieving limited success.
She earned friends and acceptance,
and it's a relief when she is able to
admit "I'm happy." Will There Really Be
A Morning? provides a terrifying, fas-
cinating look at a movie-land Cin-
derella sentenced to hell and
removes a huge chunk of the Holly-

TV MOVIES 1983-84 EDITION
Ed. by Leonard Maltin
Signet Books

It's 11:30 p.m. and you're not
tired, so maybe you'll watch a movie.
What's on? Hmm—Gregory Peck’s
Twelve O'Cloclc High is on Channel 7

and Dark Victory is on Channel 12. '

You haven't seen either one, and
both sound good. Which to watch? A;
dilemma. .

The solution: TV Movies, the

0 updated fifth edition, listing over!

15,000 movies currently available
for regular and cable television.;
Alphabetically arranged, the entries
include the complete film title (as
well as possible alternate titles), year
of release, country of origin, color or
black-and-white status, running‘
length, the director, cast and a com-
pact plot summary. Film musical‘
entries also namekey songs. Made-7
for-TV movies are also listed and
identified as such. And it's all done

0 with humor and style. V

The films are rated by Maltin and
his editorial staff. The system runs
from ”Bomb” to ”****,” and while
highly arbitrary, the scale is reasona-
bly reliable. ‘

Each edition of TV Movies is
increasingly useful as numerous
silent films, early talkies, TV
movies, recent releases and even
films which were unreleased theatri-
cally are added. This newest volume
includes movies made as recently as
mid-1982.

A bible for the late-show watcher.

girl discovered in a laundromat
than some starlet showing lots
of cleavage. _
A similarly luxurious number
entitled "Do You Wanna Hold
Me?" should welcome Bow
Wow, Wow onto American

radio's expanding playlists, its _

chorus just dripping with Anna-
bella’s alluring laments. The
appeal of this song proves that
nothing but time stands
between her and the places that
great looks, charisma and talent
lead to in America—I-Iollywood,
Broadway, and most impor-
tantly, the bank.

Blondie clearly never
regained their edge after the
success of Parallel Lines, and con-
sidering their current demise,
the contributions of Chapman
have to be reassessed. Bow
Wow Wow will have to be more
demanding of themselves if
they are to avoid that same star-
orbit and burn-out. They may
have gotten going, but this
album doesn't prove them
tough enough to weather the
fleeting whims of the buying
public. Durability demands the
kind of sustained writing ability
which no one here has yet to
exhibit.

WAR
U2
Island Records

The one thing U2 never
lacked was confidence. Even
before tne U.S. release of their
debut album, Boy, their label did
everything in its power to have
this band proclaimed ”The Next
Big Thing.”

' However, what followed the

“immense build-up was two con-
fused, although promising,
albums. They were admirable in
their lofty heights, no doubt,
but on the whole, the efforts
were uninspiring, and the group
appeared undeserving of all the
attention—in other words, ”No
Big Thing.” -

With the release of their third
album, _War, U2 has emerged
from the hype and left that

‘ awful catch word—”po-
tential"—behind. War is an
album, not unlike the first two,

r that takes on a difficult subject,

as the title suggests. However,
this time out, U2 are armed and
ready.

The stage is Northern Ire-
land, and the scene is sectarian
terrorism. It is a familiar scene
to U2, all four of whom were
born and -grew up in war-torn
Dublin. They have come to
know terrorism as a way of life,
and they despise it accordingly.
Lead singer Bono Vox’s passion-
ate, almost desperate, vocals
play off a whining lead guitar in

A’ songs like "Surrender” to create
a sense of urgency. U2’s lead"

guitarist, known simply as The

W
/

  

'Edge, also stands out, playing
jagged riffs that create the feel-
ing of musical militarism (or
anti-militarism). This is done on

some of the album's strongest‘

songs, like the opener, "Sunday,
Bloody Sunday,” and with the
exceptional support of bassist
Adam’ Clayton and drummer
Larry Mullen, Ir.

Still, Vox’s strong lead vocals
never threaten to outdo the
bands’ playing, while The Edge’s
expressive guitar chords never
leave Clayton and Mullen
behind. Whether addressing the
atrocities of senseless violence,
as in "Sunday, Bloody Sunday,”
or a more romantic struggle
such as‘ ”Drowning Man,” U2
always seem to stay out of each
other’s way———a considerable
task in light of the passion they
create. There is confrontation
at nearly every turn, but the
band always has enough savvy
to stay away from offering solu-
tions. Instead, they use their
forum to illuminate the moral
crimes to which they are
witness.

Given the lukewarm critical
response to their first two
albums, U2 is to be admired for
pushing on. The raw power and
intensity the band has had from
the start has now been given a
clear focus. With all the public-
ity and image-building behind
them, it looks as if the band can
now simply make the great
music they are capable of—and
War is the first of its kind.

Yeah, I know, Robin Williams

is the tame actor who played

four-letter words.

The album does have some
very humorous routines. The
best by far is ”Elmer Fudd Sings

using the cartoon character's

”Fire.” Other good routines are
”The Falklands" and impersona-

KIHNSPIRACY
Greg Kihn Band
Beserkley

Greg Kihn spent years mak-

ing albums that received very .

little notice from radio pro-
grammers. Then came ”The
Breakup Song,” and suddenly,
Kih_n was known by Top Forty,

AOR, and Adult Contemporary’

listeners alike. ”Breakup” was
on the album Rackihnroll, and
since that time, Kihn has been

trying to retainthat audience..
' Last year's Kihntinued did not

fare too well, but Kihnspiracy has
a slightly better chance.

”]eopardy,” the first.hit, is not
the reason that this album could
become a success; the song is
dancable and fun but, frankly,
not great. ”Fascination," a fast-
paced pop song that truly high-
lights the band's strengths, is
much better. ”I Fall To Pieces”
and "Curious" are also very
good cuts. '

The Greg Kihn Band and
Kihnspiracy are both good. The
album is recommended with
caution. The album does raise
one question: How long can
Kihn find album titles that fit
his name?

By LINDA HENRY

If you haven't been in touch with
what is going on in the Studio Thea-
tre in the basement of the Cathedral
of Learning, now is a good time to
begin. This may seem a strange sug-

L gestion since the production being

performed this weekend is a chil-
dren's show, but the messages in this
production are not your average girl
meets Prince Charming and after a
few minor problems, they get mar-
ried and live happily ever after type.
Titled You and Me, it is a 45-minute
show of excerpts from the book Free
To Be . . . You And Me, conceived by
Marlo Thomas. Gloria Steinem des-
cribed its contents as a ”message of
freedom . and all the practical
changes that are necessary to get rid
of old-fashioned systems based on
sex and race.” It is enlightening and
enchanting at the same time.
Directed by Lisa Guttadora, You
aml My deals with various problems
of childhood including sibling
fivalry, the conflict between a girl
A/l‘|0 wants to join an all-male base-
aall team captained by her (former)
oest friend, William (who wants
more than anything to own a doll),

and general growing pains. There
were a couple of moments when the
choreography was stilted and failed
to capture the spontaneity of child-
ren at play and a few places where the
energy level dropped, but these were
due mostly to the lack of an audience
to play to and gain necessary feed-
back from.

Dan Barnhart and Leona Nicole
are convincing as newborn babies
trying to decide what sex they are in
”Boy Meets Girl.” In ”The Pain and
The Great One,” Waverly Deutsch
and Christian Gauthier play lovable
sibling rivals, and Rob Roznowski’s
voice is a tribute throughout to the
celebration intended in this produc-
tion. A standout performance is
given by Wendy Held, who handles
character changes as a mother (Willi-
am’s grandmother) who buys her son
a doll, and each child she plays is
portrayed with a separate identity
and conviction.

So, bring your children, your nie-
ces and nephews, the kids next-door
or just the child within yourself and
be taken back for an hour into this
fantasy land where children are free

to be what they want to be.

election manifesto. We would never write about how I'd run the govern-
ment or things like that, not ever.” The result is a deeper complexity and a
musical ambivalence that challenges the listener. The band does not push
pet issues, protest Congressional acts or demand Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan. In every Gang of Four song, the focus is stripped down to the
immediate world of the individual. Yet, the songs are political in the sense
that none of the relationships or interactions in the individual’s life are seen
as separable from the context of the political economic structure. Even sex

  

ANDY GILL, JON KING, SARA LEE (bassist)
is political: ”She pays him back in the bedroom/One step down from her leader/Obeys or is
punished/Like he obeys his bosses." So is religion: "For reasons that are not mysterious the
weak are sent to the wall/They have reservations in heaven/Down here they're not so
fashionable."

Even to the fanatic listener, Gang of Four’s ’’message'' can peak through
on an emotional level yet still remain very elusive. Since the songs remain
so open to interpretation, they will not strike various people in quite the
same way. The band is much more concerned with discovering the essential
questions than they are with dictating the answers. They use their energy
to arouse the listener from a state of passivity and into one of dance, anger

and thought.

Napoli Pizzeria
3606 Fifth Ave., Oakland

By THE WORKING STIFF

Some Italian restaurants, deep down,
are as Italian as apple pie.

Napoli Pizzeria in Oakland is true green,
white and red - the colors of the Italian flag
- from wall panels to the globes on the light
ﬁxtures to the mesh pans on the wall that
illustrate the sizes of pizza.

The travel posters extol the Calabria
region outside Naples. Behind the counter
hangs a poster of the I982 World Cup
championship soccer team. A stack of fly-
ers advertises a bake sale by the Pitt Italian
Club. And presiding over it all is Napoli's
trademark, the statue of the rotund chef
with a mustache, pizza pan outstretched to
advertise “the real Italian touch.”

Napoli's tomato sauce had a low quo-
tient of common Italian spices, but few
restaurants go to such lengths to advertise
their Italian roots.

And no one serves bigger pizza cuts. I
ordered my customary half-hoagie and
two cuts of pizza, but had to leave part of it
behind.

The pizza cuts are 75 cents each, a price
that should have tipped me to their size:
roughly eight inches wide, 10 or 12 inches
long and about 3/.-inch thick. The doughy
consistency and the cheesy flavor are dif-
ferent from most Pittsburgh pizzas - and I

been instrumental in the team’s
success—as much for his talent as
for his ability to inspire his
teammates.

“Frank gets everybody fired up,’
teammate Chris Femiani said. “He

.realized what it was going to take at
the beginning of the season and
worked very hard with everybody on
the team all year.

“He was always up at the gym

9

'’'?doing extra work on the routines

and helping out the freshmen, who
became such an important part of
the team.”

And Kratz has the opportunity to
qualify for the NCAA champion-
ship being held at Penn State. It
would be the second visit for Kratz,
a junior. Kratz will qualify if his
standing on the vault—currently
fourth in the East—remains intact
until April 3, the end of the regular
season for gymnastic teams.

“lt’s pretty fun having the oppor-
tunity to compete in the Nationals,”
Kratz said. “I made it as a freshman,
so I have a little experience.”

As is the case with most collegiate
athletes, Kratz’s role with Pitt has
changed over time.

“The years have gone fast,” he

2 said. “I remember when I was the

freshman who needed the support.
But now I’m on the other side.

“I think I‘ve matured a lot this
season, and I’ve changed my atti-
tudes in other ways, too.”

Academics have been gaining
importance in Kratz’s life. Before,
his life was gymnastics, which was
the reason he selected Pitt over West
Virginia, Ohio State and other
schools when he graduated from
Ambridge High School.

“When I chose to go to Pitt, I did —

so strictly because of gymnastics,"
he said. “Before, I wasn't too wor-
But now I’m
working hard in both, and it’s pretty
satisfying."

According to Kratz, the team’s
success has _come for many reasons.

“We 'weren‘t sure how good we
were going to be, " he said. “We had a
lot of freshmen. We knew they were
good. but you can never tell until

rtheyaact-ually compete. -5

‘‘There’s quite an adjustment that
has to take place when going from
high school‘ to college competition.
They have adapted and helped us a
great deal.” T

According to Femiani, the team
captain, Kratz has been invaluable
to the squad. A good example would
be a recent meet against Ohio State,
one of the better gymnastic teams in
the nation.

“Frank isworthe about 53 to 54
points in the all-around every meet,”
Femiani said. “We found out a little
bit about how much he means to us

Martin, Flock Flying To Regional Championships

By SARA STRICKLAND

The 1983 NCAA East Regional
Women's Gymnastics Champion-
ships, hosted by West Virginia, will
commence March 26. Although the
Lady Panthers missed qualifying as
a team, they will send two ‘individu-
als to represent Pitt, Karen Martin
and Babbie Flock. Winners of
Saturday’s regional meet will move
on to compete in NCAA National
Championships in Utah.

This year was the first year in
which the Lady Panthers competed

as a member under NCAA guide- .

lines. The Lady Panthers had the
disadvantage of being inserted into
the largest and toughest region
because of the new NCAA rules.
“Our ' region consists of 33
schools, and out of these schools are
included some non-traditional East-
ern strengths [including] Ohio State,
N.C. State and Duke," said Coach
Donna Sanft. “This region put us at
a disadvantage because we were up
against 33 strong teams in order to
qualify, where other teams were only
up against seven. And the regions

'will be changed against next year.”

Martin, a junior, and Flock, a
senior, are ranked second and third,
respectively, in the individual all-
around standings. Pitt is the only
team that qualified two people in the
individual all-around competition.

Although Martin and Flock will

Spikers Dumped By Lions

By MARK A. SINDLER

Penn State vollelyball coach Tom
Tait returned a long-distance phone
call early this week and probably did
so more to stress a certain point than
out of courtesy.

That one significant point came
across in brutal fashion Tuesday
evening when the Nittany Lions had
a field day against Pitt. Tait’s squad
wreaked havoc ‘on the Panthers.15-
5, 15-4, 17-15. In short, Tait made
sure‘ his players came out swinging’
and smashing, making no mistakes
along the way. ,

Recurring mistakes were his sore
spot earlier in the season when the
team travelled to Trees Hall for the
Pitt Invitational. Tait remembers
the experience, perhaps in an all too
painful manner. During that Feb.

11-13 weekend, Penn State had its
doors blown off by Midwest-rival
Ball State in four games; it’s a defeat
that still stands today as Penn
State’s ony blemish this year—20-1.

“At the time we headed for the
Pitt tournament,” Tait said earlier
this week, “I was not at all pleased
with the way we were playing and
the things we’ were doing at the time.
We just weren’t doing the kinds of
things in practice or in matches that
we are capable of doing and that we
will have to be doing when we move
into the championship point of the
season.” .

Tait sounds confident-—maybe

rightly so. If anything, though, the

from a team standpoint. If Frank
had been competing in the all-
around [against Ohio State] instead
of just the vault,we could have had
anywhere from seven to nine addi-
tional points, which would have
given us 268 or 269 points instead of
261.”

A goal of any successful collegiate
athlete is to achieve All-America
honors in their sport. But Kratz real-
izes gaining such rewards is going to
demand great effort.

“It would definitely take my best
vault of the season to make All-

, Panthers’ loss to his team probably

reﬂected the slowly-emerging fact
that Pitt will have one slick road to
travel if it expects to play competi-
tively against the Hulks of the East-
ern Collegiate Volleyball League
during playoff time.

Pitt coach Ray Reilly c’an.thus be
excused for his irate mood after the
Penn State match.

“We played terribly,” he said in a
grim tone. “Penn State was playing
as they should have....They were just
awesome. They didn’t make any
mistakes and were doing everything
right.”

There seems to be an echo some-
where. Tait not only hinted that his
squad had to inch near-perfection to
play to its current fifth-ranked
[nationally] potential, but he
soundly impressed this point on the
_visiting coach Reilly. Although Tait

t suffered some difficulty in pinpoint- 2

ing the problems his players were
having, it seems he corrected them in
the strong match against Pitt. -

“[The problems] weren’t highly

specific things,” Tait explained. “It
was a basic attitude really through-
out the squad...that was, really, per-
haps we didn’t have to work as hard
as previous years because there’s so
‘much talent arond. '

“I also think there was a tendency
to think only in terms of the cham-
pionship season rather than think-
ing in terms of preparing for this
point in the season.”

The Panthers could have had their

America, not to mention a little help
from some of the other guys compet-
ing. The guys who make it to this
meet are the best in the nation.”

Both Kratz’s and the team’s future

(seems bright.

“When I got here, the program
was still bright,” he said. “This year,
we competed with some of the big
names. I know next year we will be
better with just the guys we have
now.

‘‘If we could get some good
recruits, the team would benefit even
more. We have nowhere to go but

playbooks glued to their heads for

all the advanced preparation they

would have needed against a team of

Penn State’s caliber, but it would .
not have helped them at all. Intimi- »\ a
dation only added salt to the wound.

Said Reilly, “On our part, we were
intimidated a little bit, and that's
something we’ve never really had to‘
deal with before. I was a little upset
with that [The Lions] just.totally
took us out of our offense.”

Reilly toyed with his offense for 'a
while, but to no avail. One change
involved sophomore Tony Zortea.
He usually anchors the outside hitter
spot, but Reilly utilized him in the
middle against Penn State.

“I really don’t lose a lot on the
outside,” Reilly said, “but when I
put" Tony in there, I gain a lot in the
middle. This time, though, it didn’t
work.” ,_

Though it remains to be seen as to
whether Reilly is running out of
offensive options, he is going to
experiment with his traditional 5-l
offense when Pitt travels to Virginia
for a Sunday matchup with George
Mason.

He is going to break up the trian-
gle formation that hitters " Barry
Goldberg and Zortea and setter
Dave Baird compose. Reilly will
have all three playing side-by-side at
the net, “hoping to get some mileage
out of that.” Reilly admitted that
Baird will still set from the back-
court, “even though it is a different

Despite still having Nationals this
season, Kratz is looking toward his
individual goals for l984.'

“I’m looking forward to next year
because I want to make Nationals in
the all-around,” he said. “This
summer, I have to work on the com-
pulsory exercises because this year, I
only worked with optionals.”

Consistency has been one of the
main strenghts of Frank Kratz. If he
continues to perform consistently
well next season, additional recogni-
tion will be his just reward.‘

The Grades Are In For The Pitt Basketball Team

-1, scorr oeuerr

./T

AND BARRY ZASLOFF

Finals may be looming over the
horizon for many Pitt students, but
grades have already been handed in
for members of the Panther basket-
ball team. They have just completed
their initial season in the Big East,
one which had more than its share of
surprises. Pitt did the impossible by
defeating St. John’s, Syracuse and
Georgetown in a three-week span
which saw the Fitzgerald Field
House crowds turn visiting power-

firouses into scared pussycats. In the

end, though, Pitt finished sixth,
which was no surprise. Now, the
professors issue final grades:

Clyde Vaughan (A)—What else

can you give the leading scorer of the ‘

Big East. The 6-4 junior proved that
he can play with the best in the
nation. It‘s too bad that the coaches
in the same conference can’t recog-
nize his talent. In the Big East ballot-
ing for conference team, Vaughan
finished on the third team, a grave
injustice by the league’s coaches.
Trent Johnson (B-)—Johnson
started the year on the bench but
emerged as a force on the boards
during Pitt’s winning streak’. The 6-7

-~§enior was among the Big East lead-
'ers in rebounding. He would have

”"j=’(aise his grade.

earned a higher grade on a better
team.
Andre Williams (C+)—Wi1liams
had a severe case of the sophomore
jinx. He was consistently intimi-
dated by the Ed Pinckneys and the
Patrick Ewings of the league, not to
mention knee problems which have
‘plagued him during his first two
years at Pitt. Williams has shown the
potential to be one of the better for-
wards in the East—witness his 24
points against St. John’s-—but he
must overcome his injury problems,
and the Panthers must find a big
man to play center if Williams is to

George Allen (C+)--Although he
sometimes played beyond his poten-
tial, Allen is somewhat of a dis-
placed player—too much out of
control to play point guard but too
small to play a second guard. Had
some successwin combination with
point guard Billy Culbertson, but
the weaknesses at the guard position
were evident toward the later stages
of the season.

Sports  

-.Briefs  

Missing for the spring....

The Pitt football team begins
spring practice today in a state of
disarray. Bob Davie, Charlie Bailey
and Joe Daniels have all departed
from the Pitt coaching staff. The
camp also opens without benefit of
an offensive coordinator. Ironically
enough, for the first time in quite a
while, the quarterback position is up
for grabs. The name Tom Flynn has
been mentioned, but Flynn hasn’t
played that position in some time. In
addition, his absence from the safety
position would be a tremendous loss
to the defense.

The task at hand is to partially
rebuild a team that finished a disap-
pointing 9-3 last season. Missing
from the practice will be offensive
tackle Greg Christy (knee surgery)
and fullback Bill Beach (shoulder
surgery).

UPI rolls the dice....

Jerry Tarkanian, coach of
Nevada-Eas Vegas, was named Uni-
ted Press lnternational’s Coach of
the Year. The Rebels enjoyed their
finest season in the 25 years that bas-
ketball has been played at the
school. They won their first 24

_games and concluded this season

with a 28-3 record with a sixth-
placed ranking in the final UPI
rankings. They lost a 71-70 game to
North Carolina State in their open-
ing game of the NCAA tournament.

Tarkanian received 52 of 152
votes cast. Lou Carnesecca of St.
John’s was second with 25, and Guy
Lewis of Houston was third with 15.

Billy Culbertson (B-)—After tak-
ing over at the point guard spot at
mid-season, Culbertson put the
Panther offense in gear. The 6-1 jun-
ior was the catalyst in the success
Pitt had during the middle portion
of conference play. A littlemore
consistency will make him a better
player.

Chip Watkins‘(C)—A good def-
ensive player who is limited offen-
sively. Watkins will have to improve
in this area or else he will be little
more than what he was this season-—
a defensive replacement.

Joey David (C+)—Despite setting
the field house crowd on fire in early
January with his long-range jumper,
opponents started to concentrate on
him, and his shooting percentage
dropped. Time will tell if he’s the
player to take the scoring pressure
off Vaughan or just another guard

who comes off the bench.

Bryan Mitchell (C)—A good last
game against St. John’s raised his
grade. The physical tools are there,
but only time will tell where this
freshman will play.

Keith Armstrong (C)—Some peo-
ple compared the 6-9, 250-lb. center
to former Panther Sam Clancy, but
only the body ﬁts. Armstrong still
needs to learn more about how to
play offense and stay out of foul
trouble. At this point, he’s not the
aI_1SW€f to Pitt’s center problem. ,

Charles Thompson (D)-—Once a
starter, Thompson was relinquished
to a bench position in early January
and was played sparingly after that.
That should tell you about his year..

Matt Miklasevich (C)——Had a
surprisingly good game against Syr-
acuse, but he, like Armstrong, is not
the answer at center. He’s a long way

a missing person after a lackluster
performance against Connecticut.

time left for him to prove himself.
Only a sympathetic heart keeps him
from getting a failing grade.
