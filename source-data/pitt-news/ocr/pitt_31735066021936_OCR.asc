New director Cavalla faces  

 

challege of larger university

’ By John Enright

Editor-in-Chief

Joe Cavalla had been in his
new office in the William Pitt Un-
ion for only four hours on Mon-
day, his first official day as P_itt’s
new director of Student Activities,
and he noticed one thing in par-
ticular.

”This office isn't much bigger
than the one I had at Rider [Col-
lege],” said Cavalla.

But the job is a much bigger
task and Cavalla is eminently
aware of that. At Rider College in
Lawrenceville, N.J., Cavalla was
director-of College Center and
Student Activities since 1968.
Rider's student population is
about 6,000. The size of Pitt's stu-

dent population — undergradu-

ate, graduate and part—time
students — is roughly 28,000.
But the change to a major

university was an attraction for-

Cavalla. ”lt’s an opportunity to
work at a major university with
more responsibility and do some
things a little bit differently. It was
kind ofa step up, position-wise,”
said Cavalla, who has a B.S. and
an M.A. in business administra-
tion from Rider.

”The size of the university
doesn't bother me. [There's] big-

ger dollars, you have a bigger
budget, but it's a bigger school
with more programs, activities
and more people. ‘I'll adjust to
that. Sure, it's a little overwhelm-
ing to look at to begin with.”

director Andy.Smith who left Pitt
last Aug. 15 to become director

of the Texas Union at the Univer-

sity of Texas.

Smith, in fact, was one of the
people who recommended to
Cavalla that-he should apply for
the position at Pitt. Smith‘and
Cavalla are good friends from

their days in N.J. The two met in .

1968.when Cavalla was at Rider
and Smith was working at Seton
Hall University in South Orange,
N.J. as director of the Student
Center. '1

”Andy called me a year ago
and said, ‘Are you interested [in
the position]’? Yes, from what he
told me over the phone and from
not having visited Pitt. I'd never
been to Pittsburgh. I'd been to the
airport twice. So I sent in a re-
sume and came out here twice,”

- said Cavalla.

Dr. Conney Kimbo, Pitt's vice
president for Student Affairs,
offered Cavalla the position back

\in April, and Cavallagladly ac-

cepted. -

”Joe Cavalla is highly qualified
for the position. He had outstand-
ing references, and he has a good
national reputation,” Kimbo said
at the time.

Smith said he likes Cavalla’s
style and feels he will fit in well
at Pitt. ”J_oe’s a veteran person in
the student activities field. He has
the criteria“in student organiza-
tions, which is important at Pitt.
He has the ability to negotiate

and to work wi_th other depart-

ments. Joe creates that trust rela-

tionship with his staff. He has a

very nice personal style,” Smith

Reagan maintains there is no ”smoking gun”

_ WASHINGTON — President
Reagan declared yesterday ”there
ain't no smoking gun” to prove
he knew about the diversion of
Iranian arms-sale money to the
Nicaraguan rebels.

Reagan also maintained that
the congressional spotlight on the
Iran-Contra affair is growing dim
and said people ”have gone back
to their favorite television

“shows.”

On his way into a luncheon
with Senate Republicans on
Capitol Hill, Reagan was asked
about statements made Sunday
by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.)
who said impeachment papers
would,be drawn up against Rea-

-gan if it were shown that he had
approved the transfer of Iranian
arms sales proceeds to the
Nicaraguan" Contras.

Hamilton was asked about an
April 1986 undated memoran-
dum found in the files of fired Lt.
Col. Oliver’ L. North, ‘which
called for a presidential decision
on a proposed diversion of $12
million in profits from the sales.

’’If that memo had reached the
hands of the president and he ap-
proved it, that would be the
smoking gun,’_’ Hamilton told in-
terviewers on ABC-TV’s This
Week with David Brinkley.

Heinz proposes new
plan to save steel jobs

WASHINGTON — Two new
legislative plans circulated at a
United Steelworkers conference
Tuesday are designed to help the
steel industry trim liabilities and
excess capacity without more
bankruptcy filings.

”The problem is that, like
lambs to the slaughter, steel com-
panies are beginning to line up
‘and follow one another through
bankruptcy/’ Sen. John Heinz (R-
Pa.) told 700 local union leaders.

After his .30-minute speech,
Heinz released to reporters a plan
to help steel firms cope with

. labor costs associated with shut-

ting down unneeded or antiquat-
ed equipment.

Another plan circulated at the

Ms 

NATIONAL BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED pness

conference is to be formally an-
nounced next week by Rep. Ben
Cardin (D—Md.) It would make it
against the law for the foreign
share of the United States "steel
market to exceed 20.2 percent
during a five—year recovery and
modernization period for U.S.
firms. ” I

Under his proposal, which has
not yet been drafted into legisla-
tion, the federal government
would take responsibility for a
wide range of workers’ benefits
that typically kick in when facili-
ties are shut down. ‘

Gra y nominated to

take over the Marines

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan said Tuesday he will
nominate Lt. Gen. Alfred M. Gray
Jr. to be commandant of the Ma-
rine Corps, succeeding Gen. P.X.
Kelley, who is retiring.

Gray, who would be promot-
ed to the rank of four-star gener-
al with the appointment, has
served since 1984 as commander
of the fleet Marine force in the At-
lantic and commander of the II
Marine amphibious brigade.

Pentagon sources .have said
Navy Secretary James H. Webb,
himself a Marine combat veteran
of Vietnam, ultimately settled on
Gray because of his reputation
within the corps as a strong
leader.

Supreme Court rules
for property owners

WASHINGTON —,,.In a major
property-rights decision, the
Supreme Court ruled Tuesday
that landowners must be com-
pensated when government regu-
lations bar them, even
temporarily, from using their
property.’

The court, by a 6-3 vote, said
regulations such as zoning or-
dinances that impose new limits
on an owner's use of land may

amount to a ”taking” for which E“

the Constitution requires ”just
compensation.”

The court also said that com-
pensation may be required even
if the ”taking” is not permanent.

The decision in a case from
California represents a clear vic-
tory for landowners and the real
estate and homebuilding indus-

tries. It was a setback for state and pr.

local zoning officials.

Students say checking l.D. on campusbus good

By Neata Nicholas
For The Pitt News

According to Arthur Dorman,
parking administrator for the
university, valid identification has
always been required in order to
ride the campus bus.

Although it has been a univer-
sity policy since the campus bus
service was instituted, drivers be-
gin to recognize students who
regularly use the service and do
not always request identification.

Dorman said the policy was in-
stated and is being reinforced to
protect those who are eligible to
ride the bus. ”We do not want to
transport the public, since the
campus bus is a service for the
students, faculty, staff and guests

of the university.”

Some students do not mind the
request for identification.

”It doesn’t bother me. The
driver knows me so he doesn't
usually ask for my I.D.,” said Paul
Caines, a senior from_Fox Chapel.

Beth Fryman, a university em-

ployee, said, ”I have no problems -

with the policy. I always have my
I.D., so why not show it.”
Some students say enforcement
of the policy is a very good idea.
Roy Jefferson, a senior from

Philadelphia said, ”I applaud the '

reinforcement of the policy be-
cause lately the safety of our stu-
dents has been in - great
jeopardy.” -
Mike Damp, a‘ senior from
Penn Hills, said he thinks request-

ing an |.D. is a good idea because
the campus is in the city. ”Any-
one could get on the bus and
cause problems that, perhaps, the
university could be held respon-
sible for.”

Although signs have been post-
ed on the campus bus to inform
students of the policy, conflict
still arises between some students
and the afternoon‘ bus driver,
Joseph A. Bechtold.

”A lot of students feel that I am
being unfair, that I am dis-
criminating, or even that I am
harassing them. When you get on
a PAT bus, you pay a dollar to
ride, if you do not pay, you do

- not ride the bus. Similarly, if you

do not have any identification,

Catching too many rays   s   _
Dermatologist advises against overexposure to the sun

By Marc Duchin

Assistant News Editor

Where can youfind hundreds
of half-naked, oil-glistening bod-
ies laying on their backs, motion-
less. You can buy this month's
issue of Playboy magazine, go to
.the peek-a-boo theater on Liberty
Avenue, or simply look up in the
sky to’ see if the sun is out.

Summer is quickly approach-
ing, and the sunbathers are back

_ in action.

”I lay out for about an hour or
so once a week," said Michelle

Modany, a Pitt sophmore. ”I
usually wear sun tan oil but now

andthen, I forget. If I'm playing.

Frisbee or something, I usually
don’t wear it.”

Modany is just one of themany
Pitt students who schedule a

_weekly tanning session on the.

lawn of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’
Memorial building.
Most people take time out of

' their busy lives to bask in the free

rays of the sun. Yet, in the midst
of getting brown and beautiful,

few realize the risk they’re‘taking.'

”The main danger is excess ex-

posure to ultra-violet radiation,”
said Dr. Edward Sherman, a der-
matologist. ”The chronic danger
is cosmetic damage and the in-
creased risk of .skin cancer.”

Sherman said that just as peo-
ple age differently, people tan
differently. ”People who have fair
skin, blue eyes, lighter skin, light-r
er hair, tend to have moreof a
problem and should‘ always wear
maximum protection and should
limit exposure,” he said."

-The dedication of some tanners
cannot be satisfied by the tem-
porary appearence of the sun.

and I don’t know you, you do not
ride the campus bus,” said
Bechtold.

Tracy Holmes, a junior from
Monessen, said, ”I don’t feel that
I am being hassled, sometimes I
just do not feel like searching the
bottom of my book bag for iden-
tification.”

Yvette Buntin, a senior from
Coraopolis, said ”If it is a policy
to request identification, then I
think that the policy should be
enforced at all times.”

Bechtold said he eventually be-

came familiar with the students
who rode the bus frequently dur-
ing the winter term, therefore,
strict enforcement of the policy
did not seem to be necessary.

These radiation fanatics turn to A

the technological advancement
called the tanning booth.

Rachel Merola, an employee at
Pucinni’s Hair Salon, said that the
tanning booth at the salon‘ is in
constant demand.

”I see more people using the
booth in the beginning of spring
so by the time that summer hits,
they won't burn that first day,”
said Merola.

Merola went on to say that 50
percent of thetanning customers

‘are Pitt students. The rest are

working professionals-

But, he said, ”Later in the term,
I noticed that the bus seemed un-
usually crowded during the 2:35
p.m., 3 p.m., 6:05 p.m., 6:30
p.m. and 6:35 p.m. runs. I found
out later that Carnegie Mellon
students were using our fa-
cilities.” - I
Bechtold said he has two very

important reasons for being so 4

strict about enforcing the policy.
”First of all, I am concerned with
the safety of the female pas-
sengers who ride the bus at night.
Asking for identification limits the
possibility of our students being
harassed by non-university per-
sonnel. Also, I do not want to be
held responsible for the safety of
those passengers who are not af-
filiated with the university.” '

”Some are people, like me, that -

‘work all day,” she said. 4’They

use the [tanning] booth to get

some extra sun.”

' Many tanning salons promise a

safe tan equal to if not better than '

mother nature herself. ”The tan-
ning bed is definitely safe,” said
Merola. ”|t's very mild. It uses
only tanning rays, and as long as
we keep the bed clean, there is
no problem.”

Dr. Sherman was reluctant to
support tanning salons as an al-
ternative to the harmful sun.

Cavalla said the ability to mold

be the most important aspect of
his job. ”|'Amgoing to have to

Replacing Tremblay .will be
Cavalla’s first major task. ”Joe’s
going to have a tough decision on
his hands. We were lucky that we
got Wilfred. He had experience
in both print and broadcasting.
It's toughto find people with ex-
perience in both. It should be in-
teresting to see what happens,”
said Smith.

Said Cavalla, ”That will be a.

top priority for myself and the
other staff people will. be in-
volved with it. People step in, it's
not going to be Wilfred, but

phone calls. This means no one

can reach a 976 ”porn line” or’

"gab line” from a phone operat-
ing under System 85, the univer-
sity’s phone service. I .

”A|l Pitt phones — dorms,
faculty and staff phones — are
blocked,’’ said Bruce Hutchison,
manager of telecommunications
at the university.

”It was a university decision to
block access to 976 numbers.
This decision was then given to
me to implement,” added
Hutchison. '

He revealed that the block
went into effect about a month
ago.

Some Pitt students said the
block is unfair. ”We should have

. the right to determine what call

we want to make,” senior histo-

ry major and Pitt football player

Mark Brasco said."’They are our
phones while we live on campus.
We should use them how we

please,” he added.

Before Tremblay was hired in

sition.

Cavalla knows he won't be

Senior communications major

Aiken agrees with Brasco. ’’I feel
the exact same way, not a word
more or less.”

Other students said they agree
with the university's decision. ”I

A don't think the university should

have to take responsibility for stu-
dents’ 976, calls,’’ said Stacey
Schaeffer, a senior communica-
tions major at Pitt. ”I think the
’gab lines’ are a rip-off anyway.
To pay $2 for a call is ridiculous.”

A senior economics major, Jeff
agrees. ”Students
unknowingly increased their
phone bills in the past. With the
976 restriction, there will be no
problems with the outrageous
bills like before.”

A'university operator, who re-
quested to remain anonymous,
said that not many students call

why they cannot call a 976 num-
ber. -

Windows
replaced in
Litchfield
Towers

By Tarun Reddy

Staff Writer

The Office of Housing and
Food service is in the process of
installing new windows in the
Litchfield Towers. The project is
expected to be completed by the.
summer of 1989.

”This will be the first time since’
the construction of the Towers
that windows have ever been
changed,” said James Beaver, the
associate director of Housing and
Food Service.

Beaver would not disclose the
exact amount that will be spent
on the windows, but did,
however, say the windows were
bought at a good cost, since the
windows for all three buildings
were purchased in advance.

Tower C was the first to be
completed. ”It would be nice if
we could complete all three Tow-
ers at once, but we have neither
the manpower available, nor the
financial resources to finish the
entire project,” said Beaver.

There are approximately. 41
windows to a floor in each build-
ing, with Towers A, B and'C,'hav-
ing 15., I8. and 21 floors
respectively. .-

”The students have the oppor-
tunity to open the windows with
the new design. At the same time
the windows have a protective
area which inhibits objects from
being thrown from the ‘win-
dows,” Beavers said.

The ‘next building being’

studied for the installation of new.
windows, according to Beavers,
is Lothrop ‘Hall. '

Avalanche in Canada kills three British men

JASPER, Alberta — Three Brit-
ish soldiers who were climbing
the wrong mountain peak were
killed Tuesday by a sudden
avalanche, Canadian authorities
reported.

”There was no hope for them,”
said Cpl. Michael Bland, the sole
survivor of the climbing party that
had accidently begun scaling
Mount Bryce, six miles south of
the intended peak.

Experts said the three died ins-

tantly when tons of snow and ice —

fell on them in a matter of se-
conds.They had been attempting
to cross a steep gully when the
avalanche hit.

Lebanese head drops
Palestinian agreement

BEIRUT — Lebanese President
Amin Gemayel and acting Prime
Minister Selim Hoss announced
Tuesday they will no longer fol-
low an 18-year agreement
authorizing Palestinian guerillas
to use Lebanon as a base for at-
tacks against Israel.

Gemayel, a Christian, and

Goetz

Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, wiped out
the agreement known as the
Cairo agreement.

The legislation had already
been passed by the Lebanese
Parliament and became law the
minute it was signed.

The move means any guerrilla
attacks against Israel now are offi-
cially illegal.

Largest U.S. bank to
divest from Pretoria

NEW YORK — Citibank,.the
biggest U.S. banking concern, an-
nounced yesterday that it is with-
drawing from South Africa by
selling its subsidiary in the racial-
ly divided nation.

The New York—based banking
giant said it had agreed to sell the
subsidiary, Citibank N.A. Ltd., to
the First National Bank of
Southern Africa Ltd., a former
unit of Barclays Bank of Britain,
which pulled out of South Africa
in November. The sale was ex-
pected to be completed by the
end of this month, Citibank said.

The sale was valued at about .

$64.5 million at current ex-
change rates.

Citibank chairman John S.
Reed said in a statement he ”ex-

pressed regret at terminating the

corporation's presence in South
Africa, which has had a positive
effect upon the environment
within that country.”

More than 60 companies have
left South Africa in the past two
years, most notably IBM and
General Motors.

Former hostages key
to W. German trial

BONN, West Germany —
Former American hijack victims
were shown a suspected terrorists
and asked to identify him as one
of the men who hijacked a TWA
flight in 1985, West German offi-
cials said.

The man accused of hijacking
the plane — Mohammed Ali

Continued from page 1
murder, first-degree assault and
reckless endangerment. He was
found guilty of third degree
weapons possession, a Class D
felony,—for using the unlicensed
.38 revolver in the Dec. 22, 1984
shootings.

The eight men and four wom-
en of the jury deliberated 32
hours over four days after a
seven-week trial.

Crane pronounced the case

”one of the most difficult of our -

time” and told the jurors that
there has been and will be ”fac-
tion and criticism  but you have
been seen to do justice. You have
attended to your duties in the
way that the American court sys-
tem was meant to operate.
”You are the finest jury I have

I ever had the pleasure of having

before me,” he said.

Assistant District Attorney
Gregory Waples, who prosecut-
ed the case, refused to comment
on the verdict, saying only: ”My
thoughts on the case are my own,
and I don't care to share them.”

In a brief statement, Manhattan

- District Attorney Robert Morgen-

thau said the case involved

"complex and tragic circum-

stances, but our system of justice
is based upon the belief that no
man can escape answering for his
actions.

”The trial has provided the
public and a jury the opportuni-
ty to consider the facts,” the state-
ment said. ”The jury has decided
this case in accordance with the
rule of law.”

Goetz freely admitted he shot
Darrell Cabey, Troy Canty, Bar-
ry Allen and James Ramseur.

The key question was whether
he acted as a reasonable man
when he shot the four, who said
they were panhandling on the
subway when they asked himfor
$5. Goetz said they were trying
to rob him and, in a videotaped
confession his lawyers later tried
to repudiate, said, ”My intention
was to murder them, to hurt
them, to make them suffer as
much as possible.”

New York Mayor Edward I.
Koch, in Nashville, Tenn., for a
meeting of mayors, said he had
no reaction except support for the
criminal iustice svstem.

Roy Innis, executive director of
the Congress of Racial Equality
and a Goetz supporter from the
outset, said, ”I couldn't believe
the good people of this city
would convict that man for doing
what was natural and what was

P

necessary and what anybody else
would have done. I think the ver-
dict was fantastic — justice
prevailed.”

Earlier Tuesday, the jurors had

es Christopher Boucher.

South Korea students
stage massive protest

SEOUL — Thousands of angry
South Korean students clashed
with riot police Tuesday for the
eighth straight day, hurling rocks,
firebombs and glass bottles.

Police armed with tear gas fi red
back at the students, but few in-
juries were reported.

Nearby crowds cheered when
the students pitched objects, and
booed loudly when police fired
the tear gas.

Meanwhile the throngs of stu-
dents chanted ”Down with dic-
tatorship,” and ”Dethrone the
dictator.”

Douglas Beane, 39, a native of

took him out a private exit.

Penny Verner, the purser on

Beane sat calmly and chatted
with flight attendants.

”He said that when he went
AWOL he lived in a village in
Vietnam for a while before going
to Australia,” Verner said.

Flagstaff
Hill next

to beach

By K. L. Quarrie
and Frances Sansig
The Pitt News

No one can ever criticize a
college student for lack of
resourcefulness. Pittsburgh
doesn't have any real beaches,
but it does have something
almost as good — Flagstaff
Hill.

During the fall and winter
academic terms, Flagstaff Hill
could probably best be
described as your basic, run-
of-the—mil| piece of terrain. But
when the weather warms up,
you'd swear you were on a
beach somewhere in Daytona.

THE PITT News, Wednesday, June 17, 1987

Video killed the radio star — but the drive-in, too?

Think back to the early 1950s — a time
when what was big were outdoor thea-
ters. ”Big” was big back then. Big cars
with big fenders, big skirts and big
screens. The concept of an outdoor thea-
ter seemed like a novel one and was
predicted to be one hell of a money mak-
er, according to business sharks.

And what a better, if not conveniently

coincidental place for history purposes to .
lead off in the ”big” screen trend, but in_

Texas. Dallas, Texas.

Picture this: A man ‘named Claude
Ezell, who attended the first annual con-
vention of the Texas drive-in theater
Owners Association in Dallas, predicted
that eventually, drive-ins would occupy
a 50-acre plot of land, have a 1,000-car
capacity, complete with separate a
600-seat auditorium.

Most days, if you've been to a drive-in
at all, the only thing you'll see is a
playground. But back then, Ezell predict-
ed swimming pools, tennis courts, minia-
ture golf, shuffleboard, horseshoe’

pitching, a washatorium (whatever that ,

Flagstaff

is), nursery and cry room  and while
there was no kitchen sink (or would that
be in the washatorium?), there was a
movie. The price? $1.

That was according to the May 9, 1953
issue of Business Week.

I definitely wasn't a teenager during the
drive-in craze. But there's something I

' miss about it anyway.

These days, you can drive on just about
any highway that was ever worth being
put on a road map, and you'll pass one
of those big, delapidated screens — the
ones with big holes in them, peeling like
wallpaper, on what was, actually, noth-

..ing more than a big wall.

But what made the wall magic, of
course, were movies. ‘

I don't know what made me look for
articles about drive-ins. Perhaps curiou-
sity and a desire to at least understand a
little more about what I missed.

Imagine Business Week calling the bus-
iness of running a drive-in theater a
modern one. They also mention a man
named ”Gus” Valentine, who, at the

STOPPING

TIME
FRANCES SANSIG

time, recently purchased a 250—car drive-
in. It was the ”Dusk” in Georgetown,
Texas.

A lot of people speculate about what

drove the drive-in business away. The '

people I know seem to think it was the
invention of video and cable channels
like Home Box Office. Why hop in the
car when good (and not so good) movies
are as near as your favorite lounge chair?

Perhaps it was just a phenomena —- or
a fad, as some people like to call it. Like
disco. Like tie-dyed T—shirts were in the
early '70s (and the '80s). Like circle pins
were in the early '60s.

I used to go to the drive-in when I was

in high school. Not very often. But I al-
ways say I'm going to go again, sometime.
Every summer, I say I'm going to go. Af-
ter all, drive-ins are really kind of fun,
even if they've been referred to as ”pas—
sion pits” probably more than they've
been referred to by their name.

I called Georgetown, Texas, and asked
for the listing of the ”Dusk.” I was really
hoping it would still be there,‘ that I could
talk to someone about it. No, there was
no ”Dusk” listed in the directory, and no,
there was no other drive-in listed in Ge-

’ orgetown, Texas.
I found a recent article on drive-ins. It '

was from a 1986 issue of Harper's Maga-
zine and was entitled, ”The Last drive-in
Picture Show.” Maybe that would explain
things. a little better.

Maybe everyone, like me, said they
were going to go to the drive-in. They said,
they've just gotta go. It's fun, afterall.
There's nothing like going to the drive-in
with your friends or your ”steady.’_’ But
I guess it was just easier to stay home and
watch movies on TV. A

has them, too. Daytona has drink-
ing, Jams and lovers. Yep, so does
Flagstaff. In fact, the only thing
Daytona has that Flagstaff doesn't
is sand and water.. It’s the at-
mosphere that counts, right?
The opening of the outdoor
cinema season at Flagstaff on
Sunday brought out the best of

the would-be beach bums. The.

city of Pittsburgh has been run-
ning the Cinema in the Parks Film
Series for 12 years now,'and the
crowd 12 years ago probably
wasn't much different from the

crowd that showed upfor Croco-

dile Dundee.

Though the atmosphere at the
movie was not limited to college
students, their reasons for coming
to Flagstaff were obvious.

”I came to watch the movie,
but I might eye a few _men,” said
Martha Hall, 17, of the Hill Dis-

. trict. Hall said she was attracted
to the movie because the crowd '

wasn't too rowdy, the movie was
free, and the weather was nice.

Perhaps therein lies the mys-
tique of Flagstaff Hill.

Gina Carpellotti, 21, of McKees
Rocks, said she came to.”crash
on the lawn.’’ Carpellotti said
coming to Flagstaff‘ to meet men

' is easier, because you're not un-
der pressure as you would be in,
‘a bar. ”This combines hanging

out with your friends,” she said.

”It’s a meat market," said Mar-
garet Welsh, 21, of Pittsburgh,
referring to bars. She said at Flag-
staff you might run into someone
you like and ask them if they will
be going there next week, and
perhaps a relationship could
develop.

Not that. anybody gets out of’

hand, mind you, but a certain
amount of interesting things can
occur at Flagstaff, like necking
outdoors at the movies.

But not all are out to find a
date. Eric Gorr, 18, of Mount Le-
banon, who went to the showing
with his girlfriend, said the movie
attracted him, but he added that
there's something about-the peo-
ple getting together. ”It’s a nice
atmosphere," said Gorr.

The movie begins, and the an-
nouncement can be heard that:
”No alcoholic beverages permit-
ted.” But; as any college student

Do we make babies 

... or sweeping reform?

_ In the United States last year,
only 65 babies were born per
1,000 women of childbearing
age. That's the lowest birthrate
in American history.

Editor's Note:' On the issue of the declining birthrate, the editors
of The Pitt News were divided, and we decided that the best ap— there is a trend of decline in
proach would be to treat two, sides of the argument. Our only agreed- the number of babies born in
upon contentionjs that the issue is‘one_deservingofcareful consider- the Western W0,-|d_ COnVerS_
ation, and that is our aim here. We are interested in hearing any opin- iyt the trend in the ut0ta“tari_
ions concerning this problem. It Will affect all of us.’ ‘ ’

It has been suggested that

more housing and more prosperity all around.”

There's a book coming out next month called The Birth.

Deart_h.by Ben J. Wattenberg that deals with thefissue of

 America's declining birthrate.’ Wattenberg doesn't take the '

stand that a declining birthrate is apositive trend. Instead,

he sees it as cause for alarm and presents quite-a convinc— I .
-« ing argument.

. Fewer people in an economy can be agood thing, but all

.'good things have to be taken in moderation in order to avoid
negative consequences. -

Consider the following:

_ In order fora population to be stable over an extended
period of time, a _birthrate of 2.1 births per woman during
her‘-childbearing years must be maintained.‘ If that birthrate
falls, the population will dwindle, and if‘it keeps dwindling,

dissappear. Right now, America's birthrate is 1.8 lifetime
, births per woman, and that may spell trouble in the future.

Our population is already aging. In 1987, there are five
workers for every person who's retired. If the current birthrate
continues, by the year 2035, there will be 2 ‘/2 workers for

every retiree. Obviously, by then our Social Security pro-

gram will be long gone, and some other system will have

 been put in place,but it will still have to be funded by some-
' thing, and that something will be the people who are work-
-ing at the time. So jobs will be easy to come by, but the’
_ people who hold them are going to be taxed to the limit.

Our economy stands to suffer also. By the year 2000, the

_ , numberiof Americans between the ages of 25-34 will shrink
 _. by _18 percent. That age group represents the majority of all
,  first-time home buyers in our society. New home construc-
. -vtion makesup 10 percent of the United States’ GNP. -That
jg spells even more trouble, and that's only one part of the
  - whole economic picture. So, as our taxes go up, our econo-
I 7 Amy crumbles at our feet, and our standard of living plummets.
. 1 ‘Our population's aging, and when we're saddled with the‘
_ _burden of supporting» them, we'll do it, there will be no '
. ' -‘choice. Butwhen‘-we retire in the 2030s,‘who’s going to be

 ., there for us? I ' t » ‘ -

u

 

. an” countries, meaning the

Soviet bloc and the Third World, is ‘steadily increasing.
For Ben J. Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the conservative

American Enterprise Institute, such a trend represents a seri-

ous threat to the American way of-lif'e. He sees our place A
in the world market becoming less and less important, as

everyone else’s share increases. « .
He does, however, claim to havea solution to the problem.

—In his book, the Birth -Dearth, he advocates an increased tax"

incentive to couples of child-bearing age to stimulate the birth
rate. ' .
But, he leaves open the question of the environment, claim-

’ing that it is not a problem. - .

As the population of the world increases, as would be the
case.were we to reproduce at a rate high enough to facili-
tate the spread of our doctrine and the continuation of our
standard of living, the resources of the world, fuel, wood,
land, food, decrease. ‘ »

The planet is a closed system, a system quicklybeing poi-
soned by our wastes. The ozone layer is disappearing be-
cause we wanted to smell nice- Too many rivers can't support
life because they were a convenient place to dump our in-
dustry’s toxic waste. ‘

And there are people who want to see thepopulation
growth continue; a desire stimulated by fear of the end of
American domination of the world.

It would seem then that poisioning the planet and starv-
ing a significant number of peopleis less an evil than hav-
ing to re-structure the way we live, the way we expect to
govern the world, the way we think’.

Should the entire population of the world be raised to the
.throw-away American ideal, we would certainly have a race
on our hands. Do we suck all the resources from the world
before we can poison ourselves? Or the other way around?

An increasing population strains its environment. If it con-

tinues to grow, the environment becomes un-inhabitable.

Which, to Mr. Wattenberg at least, would seem afmore at-
tractive alternative than dealing with the problem of an ar-

I ‘ chaic system? of «public support. by  ‘

Is it more immoral to rob a

I ain't no marxist, but man, is
that a question worthy of dis-

Those of us-who were born in the mid—1960s are
the first post-sexual revolution generation. By the
time we were born, the sexual revolution was al-
ready in progress. The Pill had become available in
1960, before we were even born. When abortion
was legalized in 1973, most of us were not yet 10
years old. The average college-age American had
his or her first sexual experience at the age of 16.

Despite the surgeof information about and avail-
ability of contraception, the number of teen preg-
nancies has increased dramatically in the last
generation. Many. blame this increase on the easy

access to information about sex.

Most of us cannot remember that dark period of

_ history when information about contraception was

not widely available, when s-e-x was a taboo sub-

ject that nice people didn't discuss. But there were

fewer teen pregnancies then. Doesn't that prove that
the sexual information saturation is en-
couraging kids to become sexually involved
years before they otherwise would? '
-According to Planned Parenthood, the
average age most Americans of our parents’

generation (a pre-sexual revolution genera- ,
tion) lost their virginity was I6, the same age

ﬂ Crenshaw

cleans up

pop music

MARY JEAN & NINE OTHERS
Marshall Crenshaw
Warner Brothers

By John Young

Staff lﬂﬁiter

Marshall ‘Crenshaw’s music is
pop perfection. Melodies strong
enough to inspire transporting
rapture, lyrics about holding tight
to life's brightest moments, sharp,
energetic, rootsy instrumental
work — all of Crenshaw’s trade-
mark talents are in evidence on
his fourth and latest album, Mary
lean & Nine Others.

Producer/performer Don Dix-

A on worked behind the boards on

Mary lean and lends a reverb-
dominated, white soul ‘sensibili-
ty to Crenshaw’s '50s-flavored
songs.

Dixon also penned the lyrics to
perhaps the finest song on the al-
bum, ”Calling Out For Love (At
Crying Time)',"’ an emotion-
charged moment ma_rked by
moving chord changes and
smooth, careful “singing by
Crenshaw.

Continued from page 10

The gl_ossy script accounts for
DePalma’s unearthed sensitivity
and heartfelt touch, but it often
fictionalizes certain key elements
of Elliot Ness’ autobiographical
account of Capone and Frank
Netti, Capone's right—hand man.

While the television series had
its long successful run portraying
Ness’ pursuit of Netti while Ca-
pone languished in prison, Brian
DePalma’s film kills Netti off,
which, in effect, could be a god-
send. We don’t have to expect a
Roman-numeraled sequel at-
tempt -in the near future.

The largest complaint to be
made is Robert Deniro’s portray-
al of Al Capone. Deniro, who's
first three films in the late '60s‘
were directed by the then new-
comer DePalma-, looms as a very
threatening character who's

glossy, highbrow visage vaguely
disguises his scary undertow per-
sonality.

He occupies perhaps 10
minutes of film time, and while
his scenes are certainly and
properly creepy, there's just not
enough of Capone on film to
make him the threat we're led to
believe he is.

The fabulous British actor Bob
Hoskins, already signed on as Al
Capone, was dropped when
Deniro demanded the part
(Hoskins was still paid, anyway).

Hoskins would have made a far '

more fascinating Capone.

In a cast where unique and
wonderful performances prevail,
Deniro’s appropriately cold and
heartless Capone functions
almost as a cameo performance
of incidental charm.

Finally, there is an interesting
comment to be made on the

press reactions to Elliot Ness and
Al Capone in the film.

In press interviews, the
crusader Ness is chastized,
prompted and provoked and
never taken very seriously, while
the charismatic Capone has a
hypnotizing aura of rhetorical
grace, which immediately dis-
suades the press from the vital is-
sues and entertains them to an
evading, satisfactory bliss.

Capone's homilies answer
nothing’ and his empty words
convince his public that_his sassy
style is nothing short of inno-
cence and respectability.

Kind of reminds you of a cer-‘

tain American president, doesn't
it? '

All in all, The Untouchables
has a broad, entertaining appeal
that, unlike so many ”family en-
tertainment” type films this sum-
mer will attempt to offer, is never

intellectually or artistically con-
descending. b

The Untouchables is this de-
cade's Bonnie and Clyde, .but the
love story concentrates on duty
and justice, and the violence is
mitigated solely by the honor in-
volved.

The Untouchables still inhabits

DePalma’s world of male-derived
fantasies, but the fantasy‘ is now

— the viewers’ — in the form of the

classic gangster epic. DePalma
choreographs his film with en-
thralling vitality, constantly keep-
ing the viewer entranced and‘
entertained.

Like the classic‘John Ford films,
DePalma has finally shown the

‘ ingenuity behind the style he’_s fa-

mous for. The Untouchables has
many redeeming qualities and
the involvement of a great horde

ofitalent. Triumphant enter- f

tainment.

Conference All-Star basketball
team during its two—week tour of
Australia. Thesquad departs June

schedule Tuesday, June 16, in
Canberra. Five of the games will
be against the Australian Nation-
al Team, the other two against
club teams in_ Melbourne.

The All-Star team is part of the
Big East's annual summer and fall
tour program, implemented in
1980. The league sends an All-

;. Star squad abroadeach summer

of Australia competed against
eight Big East schools last fall, but
this is the All—Stars’ first trip

Pitt Panther Summer Football
Camps. The camps are being
held currently at Pitt Stadium,
hosted by the University of
Pittsburgh coaching staff.

coach, thinks summer camps

Bogues considered promising bySixers

By Ralph Bernstein
AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA — If an out-
standing perimeter shooter isn't
available when their turn comes
in the first round of the NBA draft,
the Philadelphia 76ers said they
are seriously considering gam-
blingon 5-3 Tyrone Bogues, the
smallest player in major college
basketball.

The 76ers have the 16th pick

in Monday's draft "and would like ‘

to get a much-needed outside
shooter. They think one will be
around. If he isn't, they are hop-
ing good things come in small
packages.

’’It will take a little courage, but
Bogues will be taken on the first
round by someone, if not us,”

76ers General Manager John
Nash said Tuesday.

”Bogues is a specialist. He
does one thing better than any
player in college basketball —
push the ball up the court. If you
want to up—tempo the game, hand
him the ball, and he does it.”

Nash said Bogues is a lot like
Atlanta's Spud Webb.

”He’s smaller but stronger, a
little more muscular,” Nash said.
”Most important, he's a winner.
He was a high school teammate
of David Wingate (last season's
76ers’ rookie guard from Geor-
getown).

At Wake Forest last season,
Bogues, 22, averaged 39 minutes
in 29 games and scored at a 14.8
clip with 2.4 steals per game. He
averaged 9.5 assists and 3.8 re-
bounds. He shot 50 percent from

' for each session). Now we
have to turn them away.”

The full session, which lasts

16 hours, is offered twice a

year. ‘ The sessions at Pitt's

. camps may last as long as four

‘ hours, in which Kushner said

some important factors can be

addressed. 1

The story of two men -
torn by the conﬂicts
in their lives
and united by their love
for the greatest sound
the world has ever heard.

”The first hour I cover tricks
and hints which make study-
ing easier,” said Kushner. ’’In
a short time, it's impossible to
cover content, so we concen-
trate on how the test works.”

The concept of test prepara-

tion at summer camps is a new
one. ”lt’s a great time to get
kids exposed to these academ-
ic areas,” Kushner said.

the field and 80.6 percent on the
foul line.

Nash made it clear the Sixers
will consider Bogues only if the
outside shooter they're hoping for
isn't available.

Nash said the 76ers would like
someone like Ron Murphy of
Jacksonville, Reggie Miller of
UCLA, Joe Wolfe of North Caro-
lina or Tony White of Tennessee.

”We need people to helpus in-
crease our shooting production,

‘ a perimeter shooter,” Nash em-

phasized. ”Bogues is not that.”

The 6-5 Murphy averaged 22
points per game, shot 46.6 per-
cent from the field and made
47.6 percent of his three-point at-
tempts; 6-7 Miller was at 22.3
points, shot 54.3 percent from the
field and made 43.9 percent of
three pointers; 6-1_1 Wolfe aver-

aged 15.2 points, shot 57.1 per-
cent from outside and is rated a
premier defensive player, and 6-2
White averaged 24.5 points, shot

48.9 percent from the field and ‘
_made 41.2 percent of three

pointers.

Nash admitted that the 76ers’
first need is a dominating center
but doesn't see where one will be
on the board when Philadelphia
picks.

The best ones are Navy's David
Robinson, Olden Polynice of Vir-
ginia, Chris Welp of Washington
and Ron Moore of Virginia State.

”l suspect that something will
happen over’ the summer via a
trade to get us help at center,”
Nash said. ”We’ll probably get
someone to help Tim McCormick
at center. There are a few out
there.” r -

He said there was one center
in particular he felt the Sixers
could get, but declined to identi-
fy him.

Nash said that the moratorium
on signings imposed under the
NBA—Players Association agree-
ment could delay things.

This will be Nash's first draft _
