Stzzﬁﬁ Report

Two Pitt students, including in

one under the legal drinking
age, were stabbed ' and another
punched inside Herningway’s Cafe
early yesterday morning.

Police closed off the 3900
block of Forbes ‘Avenue and
surrounded Hemingway’s Cafe
with police tape after the incident,

which occurred at 12:49 a.m.

According to Ofﬁcer -Josh
Hartle of the Pittsburgh city
police, Eric’N. Barrionuevo, age
24, was stabbed in the chest and
lung area and Jared M. Nash, age
20, was stabbed in the side.

It is against Hemingway’s
policy to permit 20—year-olds into
the bar at night.

Mark G. Puzas, 21, was

punched in the mouth. V
Barrionuevo was ‘ in critical

condition when he and Nash

were taken to UPMC Presbyterian

7‘ hospital.
“I was talking to him earlier, ~

and he seems alright,” said Hartle.
No arrests were made at the

, scene. The suspect is described

as a black male in his 305,‘
approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall

with an average build and a small
iafro haircut. He was allegedly with
a white male of the same age and
size when all five men got into a
i ﬁght inside the cafe.

doing the primary investigation,”
said Lt. Holly Lamb, of the Pitt

police. “\X/e’re assisting them as

much as we can.”

University holds

monthly.

on sustainability

by Angela Reno
Stzi1_/if Wrder

Pitt’s monthly sustainability
meeting _all started as a class
assignment. ‘

According -to professor Rosemary
Capo of the department of geology
and planetary sciences, these meetings,
which bring together representatives
from various departments, began last
semester as a result of a project by
Theresa Romanosky, a student in her
sustainability class.

These meetings include
representatives from housing, dining
and transportation, as well as student’
leaders from Student Government
Board, Free the Planet and Engineers
for a Sustainable \World. About 20
people attended the second meeting
on Friday in the SGB conference
room in the William Pitt Union.

meeting

“[The meetings] have been very
productive,” said SGB environmental

committee chairman Torn Hudzik.
“[TheyI give students a chance to see
what’s going on around campus.”

All of the attendees agreed .
that education of students about
sustainability, how they can participate
and awareness of what the University
is doing is necessary to motivate
students about how they can positively I
impact their current environment. _

Speciﬁc departments have taken 
their own initiatives, many of which 
students may not be aware. 

Sodexo, for one, gives all of its used
oil to a company that recycles it and.
creates bio—diesel fuel. The company
went tray—less in the Sutherland
dining facilities and are looking to do
the same elsewhere as it saves money
in terms of water and energy used to
wash them, a representative said at

Goodies galore at PPC's annual Bigelow festival

the cheesesteaks -from the table shortly
before the competition was set to begin.

With only 14 people able to participate,
12 men and two women, the PPC started
the race anyway.

Pitt senior Ben Gillespie, in tears,
ﬁnished ﬁrst and won a $100 Visa gift
card. _

Fall Fest provided free ice cream,
caricatures and airbrushed T-shirts to
any student who. was willing to wait in
line, too. Carnival games lined one side
of Bigelow Boulevard.

Students also could take in the sounds

event. Henna tattoos and wax hand-
making were available, too.

For Oakland’s aspiring competitive
eaters, Gillespie said that the key
to ‘winning was “pouring water on
the sandwich and eating it as fast as
possible.

“The water makes it easier to swallow,”
he said. .

Gillespie trained by eating three
pounds of pasta and drinking a gallon
of water the day /before. He had already

won three previous contests: pie, hot
dog and Spam eating contests.

“The Spam was deﬁnitely the most
difﬁcult,” he said. “I was deﬁnitely in
the bathroom an hour later. Thankfully
it won’t be the same with this one. This
was a wonderful experience.”

Pitt Program Council instated a new
registration technique this year by giving
undergraduate students orange cards
that listed the events available.

Once a student went to that event,
a PPC committee member stamped the

card. However, the event staff ran out of
cards before the end of the day.

Brian Pham, a junior and pharmacy
major, said he thought that the cards were
a good idea but were not very effective.

“-I understand the logic behind them,”
he said. “I just think that they should
have prepared for more students to
come. Plus, if they ran out, that means
that some students could just walk in
without monitoring and could do more
things than the people who had to punch
their cards.”

junior Gwen Weaver agreed.

“I’ve been looking for pumpkins ever
since I got here,” she said. “This is fun,
but I wish they had a better supply of
stuff, not just long lines for everything.”

But overall, Pham and Weaver said
the event was a success and made their
Saturdays worthwhile.

“Fall Fest was sick this year,” said
Weaver. “Great activities, great music,
especially Motion City Soundtrack. I’ll
deﬁnitely be back for Bigelow Bash and
this next year.”

card “in transit.” Observers say that interpretation
would include Haitian migrants  the country
illegally for decades

Gloria Amezquita, a coordinator with Jesuit
Reﬁigee and Migrant Services in the capital of
Santo  said Dominican  have
been ordered not to process ID applications if
parents cannot produce residencycards Even more
 she said, the government is applying the
new policy retroactively and  citizenship
from some Dominicans of Haitian descent

\Wrthout ID cards, those of Haitian descent
canonlyattendpublic schoolthroughsixthgrade

Lacking education and a work permit, they 
are destined for menial jobs. They also are denied
public health insurance

“You are condemning them to this cycle of
poverty,” said Amezquita.

Noel’s mother sells coffee on street comers, but
he had dreams of  college and someday
running a hotel. Instead, he ended up following her
pathand spenthisdays sellingempanadasonthe

As in many countries, the new get—tDug,h
apprmch on illegal immigrants has proven

popular: The National Private Enterprise Council,
an inﬂuential business organization, unveiled a
migration plan this month that backs the denial of
citizenshiptothechildrenof illegalimmigrants
The organization calls the migration boom a
threat to Dominican—bom workers. “We have to

director for the W/ashington-based Robert F

seeking Haitian citizenship is not feasible for most
people born in the Dominican Republic

Besides the legal issues of citizenship, there
is a ﬁindamental question of identity, Goncalves
Margerin said “They play baseball, they 
Spanish, they dance the bachata,” she said “These
are Dominicans’ ’

Noel, for example, says he knows almost
nothing about Haitian history andcan barely speak
Creole “I think it is just a minority, a  who
areracist'Iheracismcomes fromaboveinthe
govemment policies That is what hurts,” he said

Although the US. State Department has decried
state—sanctioned  against Dominicans
of Haitian descent, Goncalves  says she
believes the United States should be more 
inlobbyinga country thathas trade  of the
Central American Free Trade Agreement.

' Fritz Cineas, Haiti’s ambassador to the
DominicanRepublic,wasalsoskit1ishaboutpublicly
criticizing a policy that is “an internal matter.” But
Cineas saidthedisputespeakstoawronglyheld
perception that Haitians are a threat.

“If the Haitians decided to go home tomorrow,
therewouldbemanyactivities thatwouldbe

Bindsay Anne Burke Act:  

helps, prevent teen violence 

Rhode Islander Geraldo Mar-
” tinez abducted and murdered
his girlﬁsiend, P23-year-old Lind-
say Burke, in 2005. According to
_ Burke’s mother, the relationship
had beenstrained for a long time,
and she had suspicions about Mar-
tinez, which were only conﬁrmed
after her daughter’s death. But now,
a new Rhode Island law named the
Lindsay Ann Burke Act will help
use the incident to teach others
about the hazards of abusiverela-
tionships. I
The law requires all public
middle and high schools. to teach
students about dating violence as
part of regular curriculum between
seventh and 12th grades and to
adopt a policy of zero tolerance
I toward dating violence in or out of
school. ’ A c s - .
According to a Bureau of Justice
reporg people between the ages of
18 to 24 make up only 11.7'percent
of the population of the country,
but account for nearly 42 percent
of cases of violence committed by

a girlfriend or boyfriend. Similarly,

., 50 to \80 percent of teens report

knowing someone in a violent rela‘-‘

. tionship, according to the National

Center for Victims of Crime.
Thus, a lawithat targets teens
at a young age, before many of
‘ them have begun to form serious
= relationships, seems to be the right
course. Seventh grade might look
: young to start education about dat-
I  violence, but many students be-
 tween the ages of 13 and 15 report
A having been in a relationship, and
I 13 percent have already had sexual
intercourse by the age of 15.
L .So, should Pennsylvania con;
« sider adopting a similar proposal?
' The answer. is almost deﬁnitely,
, but there are certain  that do
:°cause concern in the Rhode Island
 law’s current form.

0

Probably the most worrisome
aspect is the extra burden that it

_ ‘places -on school districts. The law

mandates that each school dis-

tiict create its own dating violence a
policy, with age—appropriate tiers to '

be incorporated into every year’s
health class curriculum. The law

also expects schools to train teach-

ers in dating violence recognition
and prevention. 0 ’

If there’s one that the _No_
.-Child Left Behind Act has taught '
us, it’s that many US. schools are ”

tragically underfunded and ‘un-
derstaffed.  many ‘cases, health
programs, alongsideextracurricular

activities and ‘electives, are the first 

to suffer from a lack of funds.

Placing a heavier burden on  0 L . . t I 1'.‘ .
Happy prices are

there called “Booty Bass Ballads.”

these programs could pose prob-
lems in terms of how effectively
school districts canimplement the

I law’s mandates, especially consider-

ing the act makes no provision for

' extra funds for schools to purchase

educational _maten'als or expand
their health programs.

There could also be problems 5

with parents, especially if a school’s 

program incorporates sexual vio— 

lence. Many parents are 
to let their children learn about 

_’sex in school, as the prevalence of ' ‘
abstinence-onlyand opt-out sex ed 1

programs can attest to.

In short, the Lindsay  '

Burke Act is a huge ‘step forward
for the recognition and prevention
of domestic violence among teens,

but the law as it stands has some :

serious problems that need to be
addressed before it can be applica-

7 ble across thercountry. But assum-

ing these concerns are dealt with
before Pennsylvania or any other
state adopts a _sirnilar law, it could

‘ signiﬁcantly. affect the prevalence

of dating violence among teens in
the United States. _ B

Dr. Draa's phone cards make it easier and harderto cheat’

by J osh° Green
Columnidt

    
 

Describing the use of a product

as “almost illegal” creates an al—”

lure that boosts sales. People,
by nature, like to ﬂirt with the

boundaries of what the law al- _

lows. They also like to ﬂirt with
their friends.’ sisters. ‘

The point is that most people .

don’t take pleasure breaking the
law. However, many people take
an enormous amount of pleasure
from nearly breaking the law. So
some companies promote their
goods by letting people know
how “almost illegal” the said
good may be. It’s been working
Gone
Wild” series. '

Now a new product is out that
gives the general public exactly
what it wants and needs: A 

DramaTEL is a calling card

service that allows the customer

to change the outgoing caller ID
text toanything they want. If a
caller’s name is John, but he wants

the person he is calling tolthink
it is Luke, DramaTEL can help.
DramaTEL also allows the caller

to change the sound of his voice ,

to sound like a man or woman,
which makes calling 1-900 num-
bers much more interesting I

Basically, the intended use is
for tricking a deceptive signiﬁ-
cant other into thinking the caller
is their friend, when actually it is
the angry boyfriend or girlfriend.
The Web site, dramatel.com, says
users can catch a cheating spouse,
fool people who avoid calls and
trick a spouse into thinking the
DramaTEL user is at home.

Not only does it help the user
toe the line of truth, but it also
helps him or her become a jerk.

There is obvious fun that can
be accomplished with a tool like
DramaTEL. Calling a young child
as Santa Claus and describing the
poor working conditions and long
hours of the elves is one possibil-
ity. Or imagine--what one might
think when their Lil’ Wayne ring

tone starts playing and they see '

that Jesus is on the line.

Despite the fun that is to be
had, there are ethical concerns to
consider. A section of the Web
site describes the proper use of
the phone card. “Basically, treat
it like a gun,” said the site. “Just
don’t rob or kill anybody.”

There are also detailed instruc-
tions on how to~break up a happy
couple in a section called “Ask Dr.
Drama.” I always _ thought that he ~
was a rapper.

To me, something about this
seems amiss. Sure, there are the
obvious ethical issues. Of _course,
there is the possibility that a girl
will buy the phone card hoping to
catch her cheating boyfriend only.
to be fooled by him using the
same card himself. But there is

a something else. I think the prob-

lem exists in DramaTEL’s televi-
sion commercial.

l_The two—minute -advertise-
ment features a man who receives
and blocks‘ a call from “Baby’s
Mama” while accompanied by P
two- gorgeous women. The “Ba—

by’s Mama”,is suspicious, so she
uses DramaTEL to disguise her-
self as “T—Money” with a man’s
voice filter. She fools her cheating
boyfriend into admitting to being
with the two women and ends the
conversation by saying, ‘‘You’ve
been DramaTELed.”,

It seems, at first glance, like
a viral Internet gag. But a quick
View of the Web site and a phone
call to the 1-800 number confirms
that they’re for real. , i

The commercials have been
rotated heavily during the show
“Cheaters.” It seems as though
there is an implied intention to
stop inﬁdelity. Yet how can this
be the case when part of the
product’s advertising campaign
suggests that people who want
to cheat'on'?_their spouses buy the I
phone card as well? ,

It’s a good marketing strategy:
Get the cheaters and the cheated
to buy the product. But  such

an absurd television a'dvertise- '

ment, can phenomenal sales re-I
ally be expected?

An article in MarketWatch.
com seems to suggest so. Accord-
ing to recent studies, couples. are
not as stable during an economic
slowdown.  Di Somma, cre-

ator of the DramaTEL phone’ I

card,’believes' that economic sta-

_tus has a correlation to inﬁdel-

ity. Economic struggle leads to-
stress. Stress can sometimes lead
to cheating. So clearly the answers °
to infidelity and the economy do
not lie in a $700 billion bailout
package. It is obvious that instead

of ﬁnancial conservatism, and’ '- "

couple’s therapy, worried parties’
should spend $25 for 60 minutes A
of deception.

The idea is still enticing. Surely
many people would sleep easier
knowing the truth about their sig-««"
nificant other. But are the ethical
issues worth it? I guess the ques-

tion that potential DramaTEL us— ‘

ers need to ask‘themselvesIis this:
Do you really need this inorder
to completely be a jerk?»

apurely cosmetic purpose, as if
calculator functionality is a fash-
ion must—have. As a’ consolation,
though, if . you press a button
on the side, a huge butane ﬂame
shoots out from the middle of
the calculator pad.

There’s _.a.. .MySpace.. group
called, “Happy Price ‘Z’ Outlet-

Is Wherel Will Deliver My First
Child.” No surprise. The store is

- the biggest magnet for Alabama’s

hipsters since someone opened a
hardcore venue in Birmingham’s

' projects. It’s weird. It’s cheap.__lt’s

run by immigrants. And best of i

all’, Happy Price is executed in
total honesty — a case study in
the importance of being earnest.
From your first step in the door,
you know that this, my friend, is
not a renovated diner where the
Black Lips used to work; This is
the real deal, dog, and these pric-
' es are actually happy.

But Happy Price “Z” Outlet
isn’t just awesome, it’s impor-
tant. But just:why is -as hard to
explain as the store itself. It has

to do,  the way the wares re-‘

_buff back stories. Did someone,
somewhere on the same Earth

where I grew up, think, “A watch
that shoots fire is cool, but how
about if people thought itiwas a,
calculator?” Where is the factory
that makes calculighter watches?
And Pugilism Kings? And Tomb
Raiders? I know these places
must exist, but they’re so absurd ‘
to  about that I feel like a
cave dweller ogling constella-
tions. Happy Price is a, place, like i
a forest, where there is order but
no impression of human design.

The store is small, the size of

Primanti Brothers, but it teaches _

that the world is huge. A

The owners are as strange
as the products. A young Chi-:
nese couple, they wound up in

V Alabama but speak little English.

They, too, seem’ to have no ori-
gins — rootless as postulates of

arithmetic. I can’i imagine them 7

this cryptic phrase stuck in their
heads: “Happy Price  is that a
Z?  Outlet.” Though they work
miracles, who could write their
lives on candles? ’
All that I could write woul
be: "Vote ‘yes’ to“ immigration
and free trade. Stop bashing the
Chinese.” And I would light that
candle every day. W

She often drips . acrylic house

paint onto canvases that she places
on the ﬂoor, as Pollock did. She
also paints on canvases in the tradi-

ates the paint drips.

Oare titles her works ‘as if they
were people. For example, “Leona”
is composed of red, pink and bright
blue paint splotches drizzled across
a gray background. A yellow wind-

“Things become more complicated as

she said.

Oare usually creates anywhere from six
to nine paintings at a time, and she empha-
sizes the importance of knowing when to

“You have to walk away,” said Oare.
“A lot of artists get stuck, especially at the

name with her upcoming exhibition at Trin-
ity Gallery, “Paint by Names.” The idea

is to transfer her artwork to fabric, which

she hopes will make her work accessible to
more people.

Oare is always looking for opportuni-
ties to promote her artwork in unexpected
ways. At her ﬁrst solo show in 2003, Oare
sold 12 of the 17 works on display for pric-
es ranging from $80 to a couple hundred
dollars.

Several students in her classes purchased
her works from this Sl'10'W, which Oare
deemed a huge compliment. It meant her
peers, students who don’t have extra money
to spend, appreciated her paintings.

Oare also once sold two works of art in
the abstract expressionist style to a friend,
who originally said he didn’t like abstract
work, after talking to him about her paint-
ings.

She cites this as an example of how she
often ﬁnds it beneﬁcial to talk to people
without an artistic background and learn
about their viewpoint.

“If you educate them in art and its ap-
preciation, it beneﬁts everyone,” she said.

For the artist, it is important to always
remember that art is a business and the
overall goal is.» to- sell the art that you cre-
ate.

“You have to jam yourself down peo-
ple’s throats,” said Oare. “You’re selling
yourself. The art is the entity of the artist.”

arranged meetings, where Maher begins

__:_r>olitely but will stray into comedic, under-

handed religious mocking if the scenario
calls for it. And it often does.

Toward the beginning of the ﬁlm, Ma-
her presents a bar graph showing that 16
percent of Americans identify themselves

 as being non-religious. He points out that

there are countless other, smaller minority
groups, such as blacks and NRA members,
that regularly contend for their own political
agendas with results in their favor. Despite

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

the ﬁlrn’s jestful arrangement, Maher clearly
is targeting this 16 percent, asking them to
speak out against the religious zealots of
America.

Most of the documentary is based on
Maher’s conversations with various reli-
gious and political ﬁgures. The interview
segments often employ the use of comic
cutaway gags, using vintage ﬁlm footage to
convey Maher’s points to the audience. In
one scene, a guest of Maher’s is explain-
ing how 10-year-old boys can be ordained

priests in certain Christian sects. Maher
replies, “How do you think that makes je-

_ sus feel?” The movie provides Technicolor

movie footage of four Romans slapping
Jesus in the face as a response. Through-
out the ﬁlm, snippets like these are used
as responses to many statements made by
the guests, giving Maher a chance to show
what he was thinking during the interviews,
as well as reﬂect the comedian’s dominant,
less serious side.

one’s mouth, he often sets them up for ver-
bal failure. In his defense, however, Maher
sometimes puts no effort into defeating the
debaters, watching them pilot themselves
straight into the ground while chasing their
own logic. In one scene, Maher interviews
Sen. Mark Pryor, D—Ark., on the subject of
evolution. Maher bluntly asks, “It couldn’t
have possibly been Adam and Eve 5,000

could it?”

“It worries me that people are running

‘‘\Well you don’t« have to pass an IQ

hearty, giddy laugh.

An awkward pause ensues while the
depths of Pryor’s comment sinks in. The
smile quickly melts from his face as he real-
izes what he just said.

The movie ends on a very serious note,
however. Maher returns to Megiddo and
gives the ﬁlm’s climactic speech about the
danger of religious nuts who have the
power to send entire countries to war. The
tirade is cut into by scenes of apocalyptic
catastrophe- flashing before your eyes as
Maher explains the seriousness of the reli-
gious—political agenda.

Maher encourages the unreligious to take
a stand against those who follow blind faith,
because with crisis around every corner
these days, it’s time to “grow up or die.”

Streak ends here: Hoyas stop Pitt

by Randy Lieberman
Staﬂ IV/‘itcr

The Pitt women’s volleyball
team split its Big East matches
over the weekend against South
Florida and Georgetown to move
to 3-1 in the conference.

The Panthers (10—8, 3-1)
knocked off the Bulls on Saturday,
3-2, but dropped their ﬁrst Big
East match to the Hoyas on
Sunday, 3-2, despite a season—high
23 team blocks.

The loss to the Hoyas ended
Pitt’s seven-match winning streak.

Both matches stretched to ﬁve
sets for the sixth time in the last
seven matches.

The Panthers also lost 2-0
leads in both matches.

“Both of the matches we just

came out and served well,” said
Pitt coach Toby Rens.

“We beat Georgetown
decisively in the ﬁrst set, same
thing with USF. But we really
came out and were aggressive
from start to ﬁnish in sets one
and two.”

The Panthers continue their
Big East schedule this weekend
on the road at DePaul on Saturday
and Notre Dame on Sunday.

USF upset more In

 
 
   

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

Last season, the Pitt football
team lost three games by a total of
15 points. The players and coaches
stressed during the offseason the
importance of playing well in the
fourth quarter and  the close

ones.

This season, Pitt has won three
games by a total of 16 points. It’s
funny what a difference a year
makes.

And while some point to last year’s
win against West  as the best
Pitt’s_ had in years, Thursday night’s
win at No. 10-ranked South Florida

has the most impact of any game in
the Dave Wannstedt—era
“This one was b" ” said

Wannstedt after the 26-21 win over
the Bulls in Tampa Thursday night;
“We needed this one.”

While Wannstedt said the win
against West Virginia was the best
he’s had at Pitt, it truly isn’t the most
signiﬁcant

After Pitt beat West Virginia on
that Saturday night last year, the season
was over. The wir1 helped to drive
recruitment, pride and momentum
into 2008, but the football season
was still over. In the end, Pitt missed a
third—st1'aight bowl game and ﬁnished

tha;nWinatWVU

the season with a record of 5-7.
Thursday night’s win ir1 Tampa
had so much more meaning. Pitt
took the leadinthe Big East and took
a huge step forward toward 
a bowl.
Not only that, but the Panthers

learned a bitabout themselves.

The most important  Pitt
learned is that it can come from
behind against a very good team
And it learned that when the defense
stumbles just a bit, the offense can
make some plays to pick up the

kills and 13 digs.

Town and Campbell again led the
Panthers in kills against Georgetown, with
11 and 10.

Inconsistency became an early theme of
the weekend for the Panthers.

“It has been our challenge all season,”
said Rens.

“The longer we sustain our focus, the
better off we are. The killer instinct is
something we’re still working on.”

After tearing out to an early lead, two
sets to none, Pitt allowed the Bulls to climb
back and knot the score at two sets apiece.

With the match tied at two in the decisive
ﬁfth set, the Panthers rolled to an early lead
of 5-3.

Campbell’s kill a few plays later put Pitt

A up, 8-5.

The Panthers earned match point on an
attack error by USF and won the match off
another Bulls’ error.

Senior Nicole Taurence led the Panthers
with 34 assists, and junior Michelle Rossi
added 18 digs.

Georgetown 3, Pitt 2

The Hoyas played dead in the first two
games at the hands of the Panthers, losing
by the scores of 25-14 and 25-19.

“We really started out well and were in
control,” said Rens.

“But we just started playing more
tentative as the match progressed, as if
we were protecting a lead or the win or
something.” '

The Panthers lost their edge against the
Hoyas in the next three games.

With the score at 11-6 in the ﬁfth set,
Rens called a timeout.

The Panthers responded by going on a
6-3 run to bring the score to 14-12, But a
Meagan Dooley attack error gave the Hoyas
the victory.

“At times we’ve been really good with
consistency,” said Rens.

“It has to start as an individual thing and
people sustaining the focus. We deﬁnitely
want to learn from What we went through
this weekend. We beat the better of our two
opponents on paper.”

Passing game opens up, leads tobig night for McCoy

slack.

After losing the lead in the fourth quarter
Thursday night, quarterback Bill Stull and
tailback LeSean McCoy led the team to a
three—play, 60-yard drive that ended in a 3—yard
touchdown run by McCoy,  Pitt the lead
back

The defense held on from there

Pitt has to be happy with McCoy’s
performances at South Florida and the week
before against Syracuse, but even happier with
the way he put the performances together. He
combined for 291 yards and four touchdowns
in the two games and looked like the McCoy

that dominated the Big East last year.

McCoy shoulcl}hanl< Stull. for some of that
success. ‘

Against South Florida, Stull proved the Pitt
passing game can show up and make plays. He
connected with freshman receiver Jonathan
Baldwin for a 52-yard touchdown and took
shots down the field several other times.

Whether he has great success on these plays
doesn’t really matter. He doesn’t have to throw
for 30(Lplus yards or torch opponents through
the air. Just by connecting on a few longer passes
and  big mistakes, the opposing defense
is forced to take a step back.

And by doing just that, the  game
is obviously opened up. That’s what happened
Thursday, and McCoy plowed the Bulls’ defense,
breaking runs up the middle and to the outside.

While Stull missed some passes Thursday '

and wasn’t perfect, he did his job. He completed
16 of 27 passes for 228 yards and a touchdown.
He outperformed South Florida’s Matt Grothe,
who was called the best quarterback in the Big
East by Wannstedt last week.

He’s yet to have a breakout game, but he’s
managed the last two games well. He misses
some passes and still needs to improve, but
that’s allowed. -

Especially if the defense continues to play
like it has.

The Pitt defense pounded the South Florida
offense, pressuring Grothe nearly every play

 

and containing him when it mattered the most;

“We knew he’d get his plays,” said “Pitt
linebacker Greg —\X/illiams after the game. “But
we knew we needed to just contain him.”

When the defense didn’t contain Grothe in
the fourth quarter, the offense usedits three-
play touchdown drive to show it could be
counted on, too.

By  Thursday night, Pitt learned that

' both its offense and defense can step up in the

fourth quarter to win games.
It learned that when one unit slips, the other

can pick it up. And it learned that it can do that
against good teams.

The win Thursday night should be
considered Pitt’s best victory in years, instead of
last year’s upset against West Virginia.

Now 4-1 [2—O Big East], Pitt will likely need
three wins to secure a bowl game But that
shouldn’t be the only goal. Pitt beat the team
favored to win the Big East W/1th West Virginia,
Connecticut and Louisville all struggling, the
conference is up for grabs.

Pitt proved that every" game on its schedule

the rest of the way is winnable. But it can’t I.

afford to get sloppy.

Instead, it needs to keep focusing on the
upcoming games and continue to improve. It
hasithe weekend off before facing a Navy team

that can score —— a team that put up 48 points .

against Pitt last year in an overtime—win at Heinz
Field.

The season isn’t over, and nothing is secure.
But Pitt did something unexpected Thursday
night in Tampa And it earned some of its hype
from the  of the year back.
