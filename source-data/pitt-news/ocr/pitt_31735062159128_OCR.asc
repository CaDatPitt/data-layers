Youth’s Program For
The Betterment Of
Itself And Of Society

BY LEOPOLD KOEBERLEIN

Another milestone in the dis-
sipation of a smug indifference
on the part of st.udents in their
relation to society seems to be
well underway as national or-
ganize tions -— religious, industrial,
civic, asd po1itical——complete plans
for another session of the Ameri-
can Youth Congress, scheduled to
take place in the nation’s capital
next Week.

“It used to be said,” says one
commentator on American college
life, “that college and school, in-
stead of being windows through
which the student looked out upon
the world with sharpened eyes,
were really feudal walls that shut
him off from the world.”

It took a major economic de-
pression and alarming changes in
national and international life to

awaken even a small portion of

the American youth to an interest
in the current problems of society,
and today the movement still
seems to have a spark which may
keep it alive far into the future.

‘Useful Citizens’

The 36 national organizations
which will send delegates to VVash-
ington next week plan to unite in
a -common program for American
Youth.

One of the aims of the Youth
Congress is to demand that youth
be given the opportunities to be-
come “useful, creative, and hap-
py” citizens.

To accomplish this aim in some
measure, the group actively sup-
ports Federal legislation intended
to provide jobs and educational
opportunities otherwise impossible
for an alarming number of the
nation’s young people because of
current economic disturbances.

The proposed legislation in-
cludes stabilization of WPA and
NYA, and an authorization of an
adequate appropriation to carry
out the program of the American
Youth Act whose provisions in-
clude scholarships for high-school
and college students, academic
and public work projects at mini-
mum wages and maximum hours,
and vocational training under ex-
pert guidance.

Ready To Agree

It also proposes Federal support
to public education in the states
and territories, equal educational
opportuities for Negroes, and de-
militarization of the Civilian Con-
servation Corps.

One thing is certain when the
group convenes in Washington—
it will be more ready to agree
upon a positive program than sev-
eral other groups which met there
recently at the administration’s re-
quest. And it seems that the youth
group has just as much (if not
more, numerically) right, to make
demands of its government as does
the nation’s business men.

As stated succincttly in the Dec-
laration of Rights of American
Youth, adopted by the group last
July: “Our generation is rightfully
entitled to a useful, creative and
happy life, the guarantee of which
are: full educational and recrea-
tional opportunities, steady em-
ployment at adequate wages, se-
curity in time of need, religious
freedom, civil lib e r t i e s, and
peace . . .”

It is a program which is neither
unreasonable nor inconsistent with
the democratic principle, a pro-
gram which should activate even
a larger group of American Youth
to positive interest——not only self-
ishly for its own well-being but
also for the future betterment of
an entire society.

that The 1938 Owl will be the best
annual ever published by the Uni-
versity.

form the end sheets of the book
has been on display on the ground
floor.

At the present time, there are
several snapshots on display which
are examples of various phases of
life at the University to be rep-
resented in The Owl. In the cen-
ter of the display is the proof of
the division page which will head
the Organization section of the,
book. It is done in the form of a
camera lens and will be printed
in color. ,

Although a senior yearbook, the
book has been designed to appeal
to all classes in the University.
Photographs, as evidenced by the
displays, have been emphasized
more than ever before.

Campus Poll Endorses
Aitthoity Eden’s Policy

Students Oppose
rims Minisize. is
Fascist llnion

By GERALD ZISKEND

An almost unanimous endorse-
ment of Anthony Eden’s foreign

policy and a similarly pronounced

agreement on the ultimate acquie-
scence of Austrian chancellor,
Kurt Schuschnigg to Hitler dom-
ination, comprise student belief
here, a cross-section interview
poll revealed today.

Coming at a time when Anglo-
American relations are of utmost
signiﬁcance, the poll tends to in-
dicate a strong student sentiment
against Anglo-American coopera-
tion.

There seemed to be a general
feeling that Prime Minister Ne-
ville Chamberlain had forfeited
American support through his
willingness to recognize Fascist
But his actions go
further than that, some students
contended. It is an accurate in-
dication that the
British social life, many of " whom
lookffavorably to certain Fascistic
principles, have succeeded in dom-

inating British ‘Iorelgn policy.

aristocrats of.

One interviewed senior put it
this way: “The action of Chamber-
lain last week leaves the United
States in an extremely isolated
position. There remains but one
thing left for us to do, and that is
to arm. The President’s proposal
to increase the size of our navy,
as a result of last week’s incidents,
is bound to pass Congress. It, of
course, isn’t a nice thing to arm,
but when even England runs out
on us, what else can we do?”

In the eyes of most University
students, the poll indicated, Anth-
ony Eden’s resignation showed
him to be a great, conscientious
diplomat. His supposed “ideal-
ism,” they insisted, would ulti-
mately prove to be more workable
and practicable than Chamber-
lain’s “realistic” policies. Some
predicted the selection of Anthony
Eden as next Prime Minister of
England.

“Today,” one student said, “Ne-
ville Chamberlain is pursuing the
easiest way out. But time will
prove, as it always has proven,
that the easiest course is calamit-
ous in the long run.”

ish masses could directly vote up-
on the matter, the reigns of Brit-

Ten Leading Seniors
For ‘Hall Of Fame’

Inaugurating a new angle into
the selection of members for the
Owl Hall of Fame, Dr. Vincent
W. Lanfear, dean of men, will
meet with a committee of repre-
sentative juniors at 3 o’clock this
afternoon to select the ten most
outstanding senior men.

Selection of ten men and ten
Women to the Hall of Fame was
formerly made by an Owl commit-
tee. Beginning this year, how-
ever, the ten men will be selected
--by Dr. Lanfear, Theodore Biddle,
assistant dean of men, and ﬁve
juniors.

. FIVE JUNIORS

The change in the method of
selection was made because in pre-
vious years The Owl committee
had been subject to severe criti-
cism for alleged partiality in their
choice. The committee this year
was chosen by Dr. Lanfear. One
junior will be a member of The
Owl staff, and will act as secre-
tary of the committee.

Choice of the ten women for
the Hall of Fame will be made in
a similar manner.

Student members of the board
were selected to provide a repre-
sentative group of active juniors.
Acting as secretary of the board
will be Harold Viehman, C39,
member of The Owl editorial
board and president of the YMCA.

RESULT SECRET

Others are Bob Dannies, BA39,
member of the football team, and
vice-president of Men’s Council;

Drs. James,
Cleven Write
For Magazines

Dr. Alfred P. James and Dr. N.
A. N. Cleven, professors of his-

tory, have recently contributed
articles to two magazines.
Appearing‘ in Spring Issues of
the Journal of American Military
History, a quarterly soon to be re-
leased, is an article by Dr. James
on "The Battle of the Creater.”

The feature describes a Civil
War Battle of 1864. In this battle,
fought at Petersburg, Va., Union
troops blew up Confederate en-
trenchments but were slaughtered
by the defending troops when they
stormed the Southerners’ position.

Continuing his series of articles
on Latin America, Dr. Cleven dis-
cusses “Mexico’s Social Revolu-
tion” in the March issue of Events.
Dr. Cleven, whose article on Brazil
in the same monthly predicted
the establishment of the Vargas
dictatorship, analyzes the political
and social elements leading up to
President Cardenas’ program for
social reform.

To sum up his sketch of the
Mexican social revolt, Dr. Cleven
points out that because of the
Mexican president’s plan, “he
(Cardenas) may be said to be sit-

ting on a political volcano.”

Student Runs Ski Shop

By ALICE BENOVITZ

People spend hundreds of dol-
lars taking courses in “The Art
of Conversation,” but it’s more
simple to dig up your own mate-
rial. All you have to do is visit
Poland, Italy, France, England,
and Palestine, manage a few fac-
tories, speak about ﬁve languages,
be a ski champion, play top cali-
ber ice hockey, and there you are.

Anyhow, Rudi Bloch has found
it quite satisfactory. Bloch, a stu-
dent in the Retail Research Bu-
reau, has done more things and
seen more places than any person
has a right to.

SPY SUSPECT

Although only a child at the
time of the World War, he remem-
bers a great many things that hap-
pened in the town of Frankfort-
am-Main, Germany, where he was
born, and in Switzerland, where
he spent his childhood.

It was in Switzerland that he
was suspected of being a spy—at
the age of ﬁve. It seems that he
had broken his leg which necessi-
tated a large cast. When he came
to the border, the authorities re-
fused to allow him into Germany
because they thought he might
have some messages concealed in
the cast.

After the war, he attended the
Lyceum Alpinum, a well-known
boys, boarding school in Zuoz,
Switzerland. At the mature age
of six, he began his skiing career
which climaxed in a period of in-
struction in the World famous
I-Iannes Schneider Skiing School
on the Arlberg.

He later Won the ski champion-
ship of the German section of the
Macabees, an international Youth
Zionist organization. In Germany
and later in England he played on
many ice hockey teams.

From then on he never stayed
in one ceuntry for more than a

A

year. Poland—-’33, he managed
a fur factory, but had to leave
after a few months because the
government wou1dn’t renew his
visa. Italy—’34, he managed an-
other factory. Meanwhile, of
course, he had learned more than
a snatch of both languages. Then
Paris; here he played more hockey
and as a side line worked in a
bank. A

In 1936 he went to Palestine to
see the working. of the Zionist
movement. In his desire to see
the work from the inside, he
joined a collective farm. At that
time, conditions were considered
sufﬁciently dangerous for the wo-
men on the farm to be sent away.

STARTED SKIERS

Unfortunately, the men weren’t
such good cooks, and a number of
them got ptomaine poisoning. Mr.
Bloch was one of them, so that
ended his part in the collective.

He went to England for a while
and ﬁnally came to the United
States in 1936.

Just at that time the present
ski mania began to bud in Pitts-
burgh, and Kaufmann’s fostered
the trend with snow trains. With
his long and successful ski experi-
ence, Rudi Bloch was the logical
man to run the Ski Shop.

Not long afterwaards, by that
mysterious force which brings to-
gether skiers, Rudi and a few
other hardy pioneers started the
Pittsburgh Ski Club which at
present has a membership of over
a hundred.

Freshman Team
Opposes Squad

From St. Vincent

Including the first intercol-
legiate debate to be held in the
Cathedral this season by Men ’s
Debating Association, three
contests are scheduled for to-

day, with freshman teams meet-
ing \Vest1ninster college this
afternoon and a varsity two-
some facing St. Vincent’s college
this evening.

Discussing the feasibility of in-
creasing the power of Dr. Warren
Madden’s labor board by extend-
ing its authority in industrial dis-
putes, aﬂirmative and negative
representatives of the University
freshman squad will match wits
with ﬁrst-year teams from the
New Wilmington school at 4
o’clock in 106 and 102 Cathedral.

FIRST CAMPUS MATCH

As well as being the first inter-
collegiate discussion conducted in
the Cathedral this season, the 4
o’clock matches mark the initial
meetings between University and
Westminster freshman groups, ac-
cording to Fred S. Robie, C, man-
ager "of the ﬁrst,-year debaters.

Advocating compulsory arbitra-
tion as a substitute for strikes in
settling industrial disputes, Jerry
Hahn, C, and Rugy Aldisert, C,
will face the Westminster negative
team.

Robie and Robert M. Shaw, C,
as the local negative, will attempt
to disprove their opponent’s argu-
ment with their contention, “It
Can’t Happen Here.”

SECOND MATCH

All University students are in-
vited to witness the afternoon
contest, which will get underway
at 4 o’clock.

At the Public forum at Derry,
Pa., beginning at 8 o’clock, Irving
Stolzenberg, C40, and Clarence
Shepard, BA40, affirmative, will
discuss the same topic with repre-
sentatives of St. Vincent’s college.

Men’s Debating Association has
already met the Latrobe school’s
affirmative at a labor meeting in
Jeannette, February 18. Bernard
McKenna, C39, and Edward
Springer, C39, represented the
negative case in this discussion.

“What relation is Florence to

Cramped-Up Track
Disagreeable

By LEONARD LEVISON

Indoor track has its disad-
vaiitages. And one of them is
Madison Square Garden. Be-
cause of its New York location
and also because of its spectator
facilities, the Garden has become

the stage for most of the im-
portant winter track and field
events.

This only adds to Johnny
Woodruff’s general uneasiness.

The situation being that Johnny
has long legs and the Garden has
a short track, creating a hetero-
geneous 880—yard complexity.

No Long Races

Carl Olson packs his IC4A out-
door champions into one of Aver-
ill Harriman’s comfortable pull-
mans tonight so that they will be
in the big city early tomorrow
morning for the IC4A indoor
championships. Olson has given
his assurance that the boys will
gather no points, which is a typi-
cal Olson remark, but which this
time is very appropriate.

He has promised not to run 01’
Johnny in the middle distances,
an order that should agree with
the Olympic

champion whose ,

mental and physical condition atl

present is not suitable for winning
championships.

One of the contributory facts to
the present Woodruff condition is
that vacation he had in Japan last
summer. It seems that the Nip-
ponese did not extend their cus-
tomary Oriental courtesy. Or any-
way, the food was not done up in
the usual Connellsville manner
and the reactions on Mister Wood-
ruff’s lanky frame were not of the
best.

* $ =3

CIC Will Tell

It is still rather difficult to judge
what Woodruff’s exact physical
condition is, but by the end of
next week the public should have
a fairly good estimate. For, next
Saturday, Woodruff will be run-
ning on a track that is more
compatible to his rather ample
spread. It is the Notre Dame in-
door cinder track, scene of the
Central Intercollegiate Confer-
ence championships. It measures
one-eighth of a mile before the
bends which is a point in the
Woodruff favor.

Captain Dick Mason, who has a
couple of IC4A outdoor sprint ti-
tles to his credit, is another Pan-
ther trackman who ﬁnds indoor
running disagreeable. Mason has
had an indoor phobia ever since
the time he crashed into a wooden
wall. Captain Dick will have
something else to worry about to-
morrow. He’s running against Ben
Johnson.

Panther Ieers

W estern Reserve

By JIM BAILEY SWIIII “WIS
In an exceptionally clean game, with not one penalty being‘

meted out, Pitt's hockey team edged out \Vester llROS€‘[‘V9, 1-0,

VVednesday iiiglit, to win its sixth straight game lll the Ohio-

Penns lvania colleoiate lea0'ue.
C? C

It was mostly the story of a fast and furious offense against‘:
. . A --
a tight dfense and it wasn’t until‘

4.03 minutes in the ﬁnal period
that Bob Lowe pierced Western
Reserve’s defensive wall for the
winning score.

LOWE TALLIES

Pitt’s second line had barely
gone in before “Chuck” Conick
and Lowe teamed up on Reserve’s
Goalie Berkeley. Conick skated up
close to the net and let the puck
go, while Lowe scooped it in on
the rebound when Berkeley was
free of the net.

Pitt pressed hard all during the
game, making Reserve cover up
almost continually and causing
frequent skirmishes around the
Redcat nett.

Coach McSorley started a com-
bination of the ﬁrst and second
team, using Broido at center in
place of the ineligible Artz, with
Lowe and Kennedy on the wings
to make up a second line. Lovett
and Conick were at defense.

RESERVE OPENS UP

Pitt took numerous shots at
Goalie Berkeley and it was only
through yeoman work that he got I
off so easily. Late in the second
period Bob Schooley passed out to
Brittain who had a clear ﬁeld but
Goalie Berkeley came out of the
nets to smother the puck for a
marvelous save.

Immediately after Lowe made
his game-winning goal in the ﬁnal
period, Reserve came out of its
defensive shell and began to pep-
per Pitt’s goalie Ellis. The Friday-
Schooley - Brittain combination
soon began functioning, however,
and the Bob-cats found it all they
could do to avert another score.

Center Grabner was the spark--
plug for Reserve, repeatedly steal-
ing the puck and making solo ef-
forts into Pitt territory.

SCHOOLEY LEAD MAN

Bob Schooley played the entire
game without a substitution,
switching from wing to defense
when the second line was substi-
tuted, and played it as the lead
man on the ice.

The win gives Pitt six wins
against two losses in the league
standing, tying them with Du-
quesne who won over Tech to hold
even. Both teams have ten points
in th eleague standing, although
Duquesne has a slight edge in to-
tal goals scored, 29 to 24.

KRISTUFEK HURT

Pitt’s job will be more difficult
as a result of injuries to Kristufek
and Cambal. Cambal came out of
the Kent match with several mus-
cles pulled in his stomach. Kris-
tufek has a strained ligament in
his ankle when he went to Kent,

End Series 

Pitt’s Panther courtineii will!
tangle with Penn State’s Nit-
tany Lions tomorrow evening,
on the State hardwood, to close
their ciirreiit series wi.th the
Lawtlierinan.

Because the State team did
not shoot well against the Pitts
in their initial tilt, they were de-
feated. The Lawther outﬁt was
conspiciously stronger. That the!
Panthers will have their hands;
full—and probably their baskets,:
too-—goes without saying. The;
Lions will be working on their}
home floor, and this will not help
the Pitt cause particularly.

Captain Sol lvliehoff, one of the
Eastern Conference scoring lead-
ers, who couldn’t get along with
the Stadium hoops‘ several weeks
ago, will bear watching in this
contest. He and the College, Pa.,
buckets are on very good terms.
Don Shields. another dangerous
Nittany gun, will also be a tough
lad for the local club to check.

Panthers Splash
For Fourth Win
iii PAA Pool

Tonight. in the P. A. A. pool

the undefeated Panther swim-

ming team hits the water with
the Temple natators. Pointing
for the Eastern Collegiates a
week from Saturday the Pitt

'mermen should add the Temple

scalp to those of Slippery Rock,
Franklin and Marshall, Western
Reserve, and Penn State.

Temple comes to town with a

so-so record. Victor of only two
out of six meets the Philadelphia
team is not expected to give the
Panthers too much trouble. Frank-
lin and Marshall swam against
both teams, winning from Temple
and losing to Pitt.
PITT RANKS HIGH

Two boys on the visiting team
will probably press for ﬁrsts.
Don Houseal, former Interschol-
astic diving champ, has not been
beaten in any of the Owl’s six
meets. Ed Spiezle, 50 and 100-
yard freestyle star, is another

i regular winner.

As the Panther natators swim
deeper into the season, they prove
themselves one of the best in the
East. Chances for an undefeated
season would be excellent were
Ohio State not on the schedule,
for the Buckeyes are among the
national leaders.

SOPI-IS BEST

Before the season is out some
of the Panther swimmers will
probably crack a national, or at
least an eastern intercollegiate
record. The best bets for the rec-
ord smashing activities are Al
Beacon, sophomore backstroke
star, and Milt Lederstein, first
year 220 and 400 free stylist. _

Tonight’s meet will be the ﬁrst
intetrcollegiate swimming compe-
tition of the current season to be
held on the campus. It will be held
in the pool of the Pittsburgh Ath-
letitc Association and is open to
all students. There will be no nec-
essity to bring a student book, as
the admission is free.

Frank Ohl, Al McKee,
Ferrara will make the trip. Ohl,
McKee, Fer ‘am and Woodruff will
carry the Blue and Gold in the
mile relay.

Compilation of points will be
the primary object, and Olson in-
tends to enter more than one man

“Please don’t, if you do I'll lose my recom-

Just why this fear should exist at the Uni-

make a grand start right here, in dispelling

It I May Point

By Robert Saffron

Those innocents who are still naive about the
administration’s naval intentions will be interested
in another report out of Washington.

(This news was not carried by the local liberal
daily.)

On Wednesday, the House naval affairs commit-
tee rejected, after a hot argument, an amendment

   

to the billion-d liar appropriation bill designed to
prohibit the use  the navy for hostile operations
beyond the mid-Pacific and mid-Atlantic.

was also soundly defeated.

What Monroe Doctrine?

Preparedness has so many aspects it never be-
comes boring. Now take the statements of several
admirals and Congressmen demanding a whopping
ﬂeet to maintain the Monroe Doctrine in South

America.

Doctrine In South America
This fetish in American politics, one of the most

autocratic pieces of foreign policy in modern his- ,

tory, means the staking out of the South American
continent as an United States sphere of inﬂu-
cnce.

Haloed by this paternalism, we have invaded
Nicaragua, controlled elections in Cuba, and taken
over the customs house of Santo Domingo.

The rahrah navy ostensibly will be used to keep
foreign influences out of that continent. But, with
the exception of Colombia and Mexico and possibly
Argentina, every Latin-American republic is some
kind of peanut dictatorship. Brazil, so far, is the
most completely fascist state, with a constitutionally
authorized strong man, supported by 500,000 -Ger-
mans, 750,000 Italians, and some others.

Our Monroe Doctrine supports thirteen dicta-

‘ice Of Dean Amos
Acquires Oil Paintings

Collected From Old
Pittsburgh Homes

By Anna May Durkin

They are pictures reminiscent
of a “long ago” Pittsburgh, when
carriage wheels bumped over cob-
blestones, when a little ferry boat
sped along the Ohio carrying pas-
sengers to the Point, and when

Victor Herbert directed the Sym-
phony Orchestra at old Exposition
Hall.

These pictures: some oils, a few
etchings, one or two old fashioned
needlework portraits, decorated
the walls of two of Pittsburgh’s
most famous mansions, the Schen-
ley home in Stanton Heights and
the Buhl homestead in Edgeworth.

ARTISTS UNKNOWN
Today, these same pictures
cover the unﬁnished, red brick

walls of the offices of the dean of
women.

Unknown artists worked upon

histories nor titles for their
achievements. According to
Walter Read Hovey, assistant pro-
fessor and acting head of the de-
partment of fine arts, two of these
unknown paintings are commonly
called decorative panels, charac-
l3€“.lSi.lC of eighteenth century
Dutch art.

One of the collection was pre-
sented to the University by Mrs.
John Joy Edson III of Sewickley,
l-listory has it that it once hung

in the dining room of the old

rachcnley mansion.
FE-HJET BKASKET

The theme of the painting is a
huge basket of fruit on an oblong
table. A somber colored back-
the fruit in the foreground.

From the Buhl homestead to
the reception of the dean’s oﬁices
was the journey of another oil
decorative panel. The artist uses
a vase of mid-summer ﬂowers as
his subject. Rich shades of dusky
pink and pale gold give the paint-
ing a skillful and reﬁned ﬁnish.
Shadings from the dark greens to
lighter greens add depth to the
picture.

Etchings, some of vividly color-
ed rural scenes, a miniature of an
eighteenth century‘ women, done
in a pleasant charming style, have
also been presented to the Uni-
versity by the Buhl Foundation.

NEEDLEWORK

Among the rare needlework
pictures, there is the delicately
quaint portrait of a girl fashioned
with blue silken thread. The
background is done in different
shades of thread with the distant
mountains worked in white
thread, and the nearer hills in
many shades of green.

The portrait of Mrs. Samuel
Black McCormick, late wife of the
former chancellor of the Univer-
sity, by the well-known artist
Selifert, is also included in the
collection of pictures in the offices
of the dean of women.

This portrait has, according to
Mr. Hovey, all the attributes of a
well done artistic work—skil1ful,
ﬁnished, correct, and proper. As
a tribute to the memory of Mrs.
McCormick, the Alumnae associa-
tion presented the picture to the
University June 1, 1935.

Because of this “woodchopper”

JACKSON M.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I think it is too bad that the
student body, or, at least, repre-
sentatives of the student body,
failed to appreciate the inspira-
tional quality of Dr. BoWrnan’s
recent message. Perhaps it is be-
cause they are obscured by the
cloud of fear of which the Chan-
cellor spoke: perhaps it is be-
cause they have so schooled them-
selves in the art of cynicism that
they liave lost their faith in wis-
dom.

I don’t know what the student
politicians would like to have Dr.
Bowman say. It is asked that he
be more specific. But it is impor-
tant to remember that the solu-
tion to our problem lies within
each of the thousands of students
at the University. If the Chan-
cellor had spoken in more speciﬁc
terms, he probably would have
been attacked for being dogmatic.
The educational system exists to
help the student educate himself.
All that can be done is to provide
the means and the inspiration by
which the student can acquire an
education.

Personally, I am proud that
such a great educator as Dr. Bow-
man is the head of the University
which I attend.

Editor, The Pitt News: .

There were many of us who
were unexpectedly moved by Dr.
Bowman's address. I venture to
say that most students, on leav-
ing Memorial Hall, took at least
one discerning glance at our Ca-
thedral and felt, inwardly at
least, that here was a symbol of a
great ideal rising—-—-“rising una-
fraid,” away from a sick and
moaning world and into an atmos-
phere full of a clearer and more
bouyant life. I feel safe in saying
that Pitt men and women admire
Dr. Bowman deeply for his un-
swerving and sincere conviction in
a worthy ideal. He showed us
Friday, as never before, that his
desire’ for a better University is
burning in his heart—is the one
aim in his life and that he will
spare no energy toward its reali-
zation.

such as these at Pitt, then let us
be taught by the type of men
which the University aims to pro-
duce. We have very few of that
type here at present. Our Cathe-
dral is a ﬁne start toward your
ideal of a better University, but
the world sees it now as a beau-
tiful building architecturally and
not as one of the great Universi-
ties of the world; rather in the
near future we want our Cathe-
dral to be recognized throughout
the world as a place where a
young person with an earnest de-
termination to contribute to so-
ciety can fully realize a hope to
reach “above the clouds.” Once
again, Chancellor, for inspiration
let us concentrate on men not
stone. E. A., C.

Words
of the WISC

OVER THERE

Robert Forster, foreign exchange
student from Switzerland at Ohio
State:

“One rarely ﬁnds a European
college student working his way
through school. Even if we should
get a job, it is very probable we
would not get money for it. Our
pay would be the valuable experi-
ence we received from the job.”
