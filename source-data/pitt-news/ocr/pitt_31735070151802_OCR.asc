Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

Evenqif Pitt receives the 5 per-
cent increase in state appro-
priations it has asked for, its
state funding will remain at the
same level it was in the 1990s.
Pitt has submitted its $143.1
million request to Pennsylvania
for the 2014-2015 fiscal year.
The request includes an ad-
ditional $12.1 million in aca-
demic medical center funding.
The appropriation Pitt received
from the state this year includes
$136.3 million for general sup-
port and $11.5 million in aca-
demic medical center support.
IfPitt receives this increase,
it intends to limit tuition in-
creases to 3 percent and to in-
crease the compensation pool
by 2.5 percent, according to the
request submitted Monday.
“It is important to note that
the current funding level is at
1995 level in actual dollars,
unadjusted for inflation,” Pitt

Maya Angelou has 71 doctorate de-
grees, more than4 million Facebook
friends and said she loves Shake-
speare so much she’d swear he was
a black girl.

“I took him to my friends and
said, ‘He’s a black girl. I don’t care
what they say,”’ Angelou said, draw-

ing laughter from the audience.
Angelou, who has received the
Presidential Medal of Arts and

three Grammy Awards, spoke .to V
the roughly 500 people who ﬁlled .

the William Pitt Union’s Assembly
Room on Tuesday night about the
impact poetry, has had on her life.
She also told Pitt students to seek
out poetry as a means of ﬁilﬁllment

in their own lives. During the hour
she spoke, she relived stories of
hardship that occurred during her
85 years oflifeand said poetry is her
means of “knowing that somebody
has been there before.” I h
At the age of 7, Angelou was

The Student Government Board tabled a
resolution Tuesday night to urge the Uni-
versity to establish an ofﬁce dedicated to
environmental sustainability, a request
that Environmental Committee Chairper-
son Mizane]ohnson—Bowman said the Uni-
versity already approved last year.

Establishing an Oﬂice of Sustainability
has been the joint effort of the Environ-
mental Committee, the Green Fund Ad-
visory Board and SGB since 2012, when a
proposal was ﬁrst submitted to the Uni-
versity.

The Board wi1l.vote next Tuesday on
whether or not to approve the resolution.

hardly stopped talking.”

- She questioned how some poets, such as
Langston Hughes, Anne Spencer, Mary Evans,
Shakespeare and others, are able to quantify
what it’s like to be abused and feel worthless.
For Angelou, poetry is healing.

“It is my blessing to have studied all the
poetry I could get my hands on,”,she said.
“My own encouragement to you is to ﬁnd
poetry that will make you laugh, make yo

-ﬁnd beauty.” ~

Though Angelou said she has many chil-

jdren of all races, genders, shapes and sexuali-
' "ties, she passed her afﬁnity for language 
:poetry to her one biological son, Guyjomisori.
‘Johnson is paralyzed fromthe neck down
_ cause of complications from a car accident; ' 
_ Angelou said that once he had to have mo:re .  ‘
[than 100 stitches removed from his back. 
fhe came out of surgery, Johnson called 

mother and asked her to recite “Invictus” by
William Ernest Henley. Both Angelou and her
‘son know the poem by heart because, to her,
the brain is “the initial computer.” I
“I count [on] the mind to do so much,”
Angelou said, “especially as I grow older.”

Angelou’s friend of more than 20 years, 

Dr. Peter jannetta, a former chair of neuro-
biology at Pitt’s school of medicine, attended
the lecture. Jannetta says he has nothing but
respect for Angelou.

“Whatever she does she does well,” Jan?

netta said. “She’s what, 85 years old? And she’s
like a kid. She’s one of the smartest people I
know.” ,

Angelou interjected with the poetry of oth~
ers, aswellas reciting her ownworks through-
out the lecture. As she emerged on stage, the

WPU Assembly Room erupted in applause and , 

screams. Angelou said she was happy to return
to Pitt and that the University is “a rainbow
in the sky.” Angelou last visited Pitt to give a
lecture in 2005.

Angelou also advised students to forge a

relationship with poetry in times of trouble . 

and to recall it from memory as an anthem
to persevere.‘ Ana Taylor, a sophomore bio—
engineering major, said that Angelou’s poem
“Phenomenal Woman” is her favorite to help
her get through tough situations.

“It kind of makes you proud to be a girl,”
Taylor said. “[It has] all the things that make
us strong and beautiful, like pride and con-
ﬁdence.” I .

President Hassan Rouhani presents

opportunity for Middle Eastern diplomacy

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

When newly elected Iranian Presi-
dent Hassan Rouhani arrived in
New York last week for the UN.
general assembly, there was some-
thing strange in the air. The past
protests and animosity that had
become commonplace during Ira-
nian presidential visits were absent,
and in their place was an unusual
aura of optimism. It -was cautious
optimism, but still optimism —— a
feeling that hasn’t been felt toward
Iran for decades. -
This is no accident. As soon as he
was elected, Rouhani made it clear
that his term will sharply contrast
that of his predecessor, Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, who openly despised
anything American or Israeli and
notoriously denied the existence of
the Holocaust. However, Rouhani
asserted his eagerness to separate
himself from the former adminis-

' . tration and said, “The manwho was
perceived to be denying it is now
gone.” Rouhani even wishedjews a
“Happy Rosh Hashanah” on Twit-
ter, a sign that he clearly wants to
change Iran’s image.

But is that all? Can we expect
something more than just a pub-
lic relations make over that may
include an actual shift in Iranian
policy? President Barack Obama
is proceeding with much caution.
After all, the United States has not
had formal diplomatic relations
with Iran since 1979. Yet the positive

' rhetoric that Rouhani has expressed
as oflate is certainly the ﬁrst step,
among many, required to clear the
path toward renewed diplomatic
relations between the two states.

The only rhetoric of actual con-
cern to the United States regards
Iran’s nuclear program. Obama
made it clear during his speech at
the General Assembly: “If we can
resolve the issue of Iran’s nuclear

program, that can serve as a major
step for a long road towards a differ-
ent relationship. One based on mu-
tual interest and respect.’.’ Iran says
that it is more than ready for nuclear
talks, an assertion that would have
seemed implausible just a year ago.

Rouhani clariﬁed this at the Gen-
eralAssembly after Obama’s speech.
“Our national interests make it im-
perative that we remove any and all
reasonable concerns about Iran’s
peaceful nuclear program,” Rou-
hani said.‘

Iran’s interests call for the re-
moval of the crippling sanctions
the United States has placed on
it in lieu of its suspiciousnuclear
program. These sanctions have led
to the rise of the inﬂation rate in
Iran to nearly 36 percent, the rise
of its unemployment rate to about
12 percent and the reduction of its
income made from oil exports by

VOUTSINOS

almost 65 percent. In light of the harsh re-
alities these sanctions have created, one of
Rouhani’s main goals should clearly be their
removal, at least ifhe wants to see the Iranian

. economy recover. As MarkFitzpatrick of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies
put simply, f‘That’s why he was elected and
that is the will of the Iranian people.”

The motivation for nucleartalks is present,
but the real problem lies in whether or not
 will.haye_the means to pursue them. ‘

but with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah 
Khamenei. However, Rouhani has come from
the heart of the regime and has held numerous

senior positions over the years, and as a result, _

he has the experience and capability needed

. to do business with the supreme leader. ,
In fact, only 10 days after Rouhani was ’
- elected president, Khamenei gave Rouhani

e absolute authority in nuclear diplomacy

through a direct mandate, which allowed

- Rouhani free reign to execute talks with the

West on the nuclear issue. Rouhani said in his
speech to the U.N. that Iran is fully “prepared
to’ engage immediately in time—bound and
result-oriented talks to build mutual conﬁ-

dence and removal of mutual uncertainties '

with ﬁill transparency.” Hopefully this means
that there will be no invisible hand controlling
Rouhani during nuclear talks.

The supreme leader seems to somewhat
take the diplomatic ﬂexibility and transparen-
cythat Rouhani has been preaching to heart.
Owing to the fact that he released a number

of political prisoners earlierthis September, ‘

including the notable humanmights lawyer,
Mohsen Aminzadeh.. Perhaps this is a sign
that he is now more willing to allow a free-
ﬂow of political discourse  the state.
So it seems that there is a complete U—tum
going on in Iran:_Not only are state leaders

trying to appear more transparent, but they
are also extending their arm out to the world,
hopingto be welcomed back. While it is under-

standable to take this new Iran with a grain of 

salt, it would be unwise to not take advantage la ”

, of this opportunity we have to thaw diplomatic

relations with the Iranians. Unless we want to
continue this cold-war—like power struggle in
the region, we haveto take every opportunity
we have to promote stability, and Rouhani,“
has certainly presented us with the greatest '
opportunity to do so in recent memory. I

Tyler Boyd is the ﬁrst freshman

Bryant to register three 10-
yard receiving games in a row.
His dominance at such a young
age has.drawn comparisons to
past Pitt receiving greats such
as Bryant and Larry Fitzgerald.

Now, after only his fourth
collegiate game, Boyd has been
named a candidate for an award
recognizing the country’s most
outstanding receiver — an hon-

umgr Fitzgerald and Bryant both

careers. p
On Tuesday, the Biletnikoff
Award committee announced
that Boyd has been added to its
list of 2013 candidates. Boyd
joins fellow Pitt receiver red-
shirt senior Devin Street, who
was named to the list earlier
this year.
A graduate of nearby
-‘Clairton High School, Boyd
leads the ACC and ranks sixth
nationally in all-purpose yards,
averaging 175.2 per game. He
also ranks fifth in the ACC in

The Pitt Panthers (0-5-2, o-4-0
ACC) lost to the Xavier Musketeers
(4-4-2, 0-1-0 Big East) 2-1 Tuesday
evening due in large part to multiple
missed opportunities.

In the seventh minute, Xavier
midﬁelder Will Walker appeared
to have lost the ball out of bounds

near the Panthers’ goal after mak~ .

ing a nice run. The Panthers’ de-
fense stopped in its tracks, awaiting
what seemed like the obvious call
from the line judge. The call never
came, and the Musketeers took ad-

vantage, earning a 1-0 lead.

Later in the match, the Panthers ‘-
seemed to have scored the equaliz-

er, but the line judge called the play
dead, claiming Panther forward Co-
rey Werth interfered with Xavier
goaltender Eric Osswald. Finally,
the Panthers missed a penalty kick
in the 77th minute. In the end, the
mistakes were too much to over-
come, and the Panthers dropped
their ﬁfth contest of the season.
“This was a game that we had
opportunities to win. The ﬁrst
[Xavier] goal was clearly out of
bounds,” head coach Joe Lux-
bacher said. “It was over the end
line when he crossed it in, so that

clearly shouldn’t have happened.
Then we get a goal called back,
which [again] I don’t know why.
And then we missed a penalty kic .”
In the beginning of the game the
teams looked to be evenly matched,
as neither side could gain an advan-
tage until the Musketeers received
a favorable call in the seventh min-
ute. A '
After securingthe ball near mid-
ﬁeld, Xavier midﬁelder Will Walker
made a run up the Panther sideline.
He effectively stayed in bounds un-

til he reached the comer where the -

goalie box meets the end line. Upon
reaching the spot, Walker seemed
to have dribbled the ball out of play.

Anticipating a call that would not
come, the Panthers defender in-
stantly froze, allowingjalen Brown
to receive a perfect ball from Walker
and give the Musketeers a 1-0 lead.
After the game, Luxbacher insisted
multiple times that the ball clearly
was out of bounds. '
“Again, theirﬁrst goalwas clear-
ly over the end line, the guy stopped
running, and the linesman clearly
missed the call,” Luxbacher said.
Following the ‘Xavier goal, in
the 30th minute, the_ Panthers

‘thought they had scored the tying

goal when Werth, after securing a

missed ball by the Xavier goalkeeper, found
a streaking Nico Wrobel, who redirected the
ball into the back of the net. Shortly after the
ball hit the back of the net, the referee signed
that the goal was not going to count, as he felt
that Werth interfered with the goalkeeper.

“Iwas aﬁill yard off the guy, and the goalie
slid into his own player, allowing the ball to
slide right to my feet. I was shocked that they
called a foul on me because I didn’t push him
or even make contact with him,” Werth said
after the game. _

Following the halftime break, the Pan-
thers deﬁcit doubled when in the 62nd
minute, Xavier scored the second goal of
the match. Garrett Halihill, who scored the
goal, snuckaball past Lynd, giving the Mus-
keteers a 2-0 lead. '

After the second Musketeers goal, Pitt
looked like a desperate team, and this des-
peration earned the Panthers a penalty kick
in the 77th minute.

With his top two options, Wrobel and

A Michael Tuhoy, on the bench, Luxbacher

decided to go with lefty Ryan Myers. On the

ensuing opportunity, Myers took the kick
with his right foot and just missed a wide-
open left side of the net. The missed shot
allowed Xavier to keep its two-goal lead.

“Myers can take them, but he just didn’t‘”"‘

make it. In training he makes them all the
time, but he just didn’t make it today,” Lux-
bacher said.

The missed penalty kick loomed largely
over the Panthers, who would only strike for
a goal late in the match. That play saw Myers 
send a perfect corner kick toward freshman
Kevin Murray, who was able to redirect the
ball into the back of the net forhis ﬁrst career
goal. The Panthers’ goal cut the Musketeers
lead to one with just 4:51 left.

Following the goal, the Panthers had mul-
tiple chances to score the tying goal but, ul-
timately, the team fell short. ' ’

The loss is disappointing for a Panther
team that is trying to ﬁnd its footing during
atransitional season. 

The Panthers are off until Friday, when
they will travel to face Virginia.

“We had a couple of decisions that did
not quite go our way, but the basic thing to
take from tonight is that we were not good
enough,” 'I‘uhoy said. ﬂ
