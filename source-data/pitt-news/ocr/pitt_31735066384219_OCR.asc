Mancuso said the transfer of the

his report, Mancuso stated, “The

Mancuso has received support
from a scientist-environmentalist

the affair, stating “There ‘is a
well-deﬁned pattern of harrassment
and intimidation of scientists who
do not agree with the opinion of
federal nuclear policymakers that

‘there are no serious health

tlihriaitt ﬁrms 

’ “ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

  P  Black Studies  

Charging “institutional racism” and a “personal vendetta” on

the part of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome Rosenberg,
Curtiss Porter has resigned as chairman of Pitt’s blacks studies
department, effective Jan. 1. Porter’s» resignation has raised im-
portant questions regarding University policy, questions that must
be answered by the administration if the present controversy is to
be resolved and if similar situations are to be avoided in the future.
Central tothe case at hand is Porter’s charge that Rosenberg is
“Under the directive -of the upper administrative fiat, which has
given him the authority to wreak havoc with this department’s
growth and development.” This is not the first time such a claim

I has been made. In the past, the firing of Marxist professors, for in-

stance, has been attributed by some to the overwhelmingly pro-
capitalist composition of Pitt’s Board of Trustees. This case in-
volves even more than the ideologies of/individuals; the autonomy
of an entire*departmen’t is at stake. We support the contention -of
Porter and others who haveisaid that, to the greatest possible ex-‘
tent the black studies department—and every other department-
should be free to choose its own direction. We do not, however,
agree with Porter that black studies should be controlled in the

—. future by an elected coalition of students and faculty. The position

of chairmanshould be retained, supported perhapsby a faculty-
student board acting in an advisory capacity. 1 .
Millidge Harris, president of the Black Action Society, has

‘initiated a request that ‘Rosenberg release .to- the public the
guidelines employedgin determining who will and who will not be
' granted tenure. it is essential this request be honored in a forth-

right, complete and non-evasive manner. The tenure guidelines at
Pitt are a morass of nebulous qualifications, and unless a clear and
consistent explication is provided, the present controversy is likely
to be repeated time and again. 
Finally, the personal conflict between Porter and Rosenberg-if,
in fact, one exists—must be brought into the open and r‘esolved...=
Vendettas, even rumors of vendettas, are not conducive to the
proper operation of this University. In 1972 and 1974, Rosenberg
bloclded Porter’s appointment to the black studies chairmanship,
although he granted Porterthe position in 1975. ‘In the present in-

stance, Rosenberg has contradicted Porter’s position in the tenure 

and contract extension cases‘ of Patrick Ntukogu and Yusef Ali,
two faculty members who have supported Porter-in the past. (It
should be remembered, however, that blackstudies tenured faculty
effectively denied Ntu'kogu’sapplication for tenure by a 2-2-1
vote.) If Rosenberg is to be, as he should be, above suspicion in
dealings between FAS and black studies, he must address this cir-
cumstantial evidence directly. Otherwise, it indeed will appear as if
Porter’s autonomy as black studies chairman may have been
unreasonably usurped. 4

Letters ToThe Editor

Spending Chanukah Away From Home

Most of us go through periods of

_ depression, but we overcome them

by thinking of pleasant events that
lie ahead. Imagine the individual
who is plagued by the knowledge
he will be unable to celebrate his
most joyous of holidays with his

loved ones. This is the plight of the -

Jewish students who will be unable

S . to celebratetheir holiday with their

families, yet we seldom realize
this.

Chanukah is to ‘the Jew as
Christmas is to those who celebrate
it, but the two are not interchange-
able. Although Christmas is very
beautiful, it is not the same to the
Jew as being home for his holiday.
Why are Jewish students unable to
celebrate their holidays with their
families? They are if they can get
home for the eight nights that make
up the holiday, Dec. 4 throught
Dec. '12. But for some, like myself,
the distance home is too great. For
the non-Jew, it is obvious winter

recess appropriately timed in order

to.allow students to be home for

Christmas. The same planning was
not made for the Jewish student,
and although I, too, see the

difficulties in planning such a

‘winter recess, it still does not cheg;  F

me up.‘

a new era for the Middle East and
the world unfolded. ‘

Walter Cronkite and the Ameri-
can media were there to make sure
each scene changed smoothly". The
script for the first act was
moderately impressive, but the
symbolism was spectacular.

This production, an unusual
combination of theater with sub-
stance, is worthy of hats-in-the-air
reviews. For the first time since
Israel/’s creation, ‘an Arab leader
met face to face with the Israelis to
talk peace--something for which
Israel has been waiting 29 years.

combination of drama and comedy.

Jerusalem and visited ’Yad Vas-
hem, the memorial for the six
million people who died in the
Holocaust. He -also shook hands
and chatted with Israeli generals
who were responsible for piercing
Egyptian soil in three wars and
kissed Golda Meir, a woman he has
always wanted to meet.

The message was simple: Egypt‘

will accept Israel's existence in that
region and will sign a complete
peace, but all land must be
returned. By aggressively pushing
the Palestinian cause, Sadat amply
represented all Arabs, contrary to
expectations about the trip.

His motives, though, are deﬁni-

‘tely born of problems in his own

country, an economic mess. The
masses of people are poor but,
much to their credit, they support-
ed their president’s trip.

_ However, as act one drew to a
close with Sadat's move towards a
peace conference in Cairo, another
praise-worthy move, this new show
hit its first major snags.

The United States--produce: or
past Middle East productions-.-was
sluggish in its support for the new
initiatives. After the long.
successful run of its “Henry
Kissinger Show," and the semi-

successful, but not very impressive
“Peanut Politics and The Middle

East." the Americans are upset
because they are only in the

audience this time. .American
support for those initiatives was.

 

and still is, crucial, but President
Carter has fumbled again.

As expected, the Soviet Union
has booed the entire production,
leaving people wondering if they

«have any sincere desire for peace.

While the world now‘ relaxes
during an intermission of undeter-
mined lengthy, other Arab nations
have given their approval to the
show. Jordan, hesitating and
unsure of itself, appears to support
Sadat along with the politically
powerful Saudi Arabians.‘

But it is the critics in the back
rows--Syria, Lybia, the Palestine
Liberation Organization and Iraq--
who are spoiling the greatest hit in
29 years. Why they don’t support
Egypt is almost impossible to
comprehend. that is if any of those
entities have any honest intentions
for peace. '

While the "world waits for act
two, there is much speculation on
the next step. The best possible
situation would, of course, be a full
peace conference in which all
confrontation states (Egypt, Jor-
don. Syria and Lebanon) would
meet with Israel and, one at a time,
conclude peace treaties: a return of
land for real peace.

A more probable outcome has
Egypt and Jordan negotiating’ a
peace ‘with Israel. in which Israel
would return the Sinai and the
West Bank. That would, in effect,
he a full ipeacepbecause Syria. as

belligerent as it is, would probably
not go to war by itself.

The Palestinian issue does not
have to be so complicated either.
Israel should, within the framew ‘ :

of the.peace agreement, hand ’ " _ ;

West Bank to Jordon. Their
philosophy should then be, “Let
the Arabs do what they want with it
as long as it remains demilitariz-
ed.”

This is based on two assump-
tions. First, the. people living on
the West Bank are already
somewhat economically connected
with Israel, so they don’t have any
reason to fight once they are free of
Israeli occupation.

. Second, it is to Israel's ben&i!.,‘,.~"
not to involve itself in Arab politics.

Israelis do not need the extra
headaches.

At this point in time, there is no
reason why another Middle East
war should erupt given the recent
events. If ' the United States
decides to firmly support the new
play instead of trying to steal the
show, the chances for peace
increase that much more.

Egypt. Israel and the United

States should each act creatively,’
and boldly and not let a gel 

opportunity slip through their
ﬁngers. If this production fails. the

future will indeed look globmy, for
the stage‘ is the world. and this.

theater is reality.

LaPat’s Summer Job ‘Fishy’ Business 

By DAN McKAY
Pitt News Staff Writer
“I got on the plane not knowing
what to expect,” said Laurie LaPat
of her adventurous summer. What

would one expectif one knew one

would be studying sewage and
water pollution in the Mediter-
ranean Sea? Lots of learning, fun
and new experiences, if one’s

‘internship is with Jacques Cous-
.teau’s Oceanographic Institute, as v
. Laurie's was.

Laurie, a senior biology major at
Chatham, was the first American
accepted by the institute. She
credits Pitt with giving her a start in
marine biology, in which she hopes
to earn her master’s degree.

During her freshman year, LaPat
took a scuba diving course at Pitt
that stimulated. her interest in
marine biology. This course led to a
summer job at the Shedd Aquarium
in her home town of Chicago. LaPat
fed sharks, eels and other animals,
while lecturing to tourists about
them. One precocious shark
decided her hand looked more tasty
than his regular seafood dinner.
This frightening experience was
eclipsed the next year when LaPat
spent a month alone on an island off
the Florida coast. There she studied
the eating habits of fundulus
grandis, a fish that lives in both
fresh and salt water.

With these experiences behind
her, LaPat applied to different
graduate schools, institutes and
aquariums. She wanted to join a
research team or to do independent
study, but Cousteau was her top
choice. She was ecstatic when the
Oceanographic Institute’s accep-
tance letter arrived.

Never having learned French,

_LaPat expected some language

difl-‘imulﬁm: when she arrived in

Monaco. But she quickly learned a
language barrier easily is broken by
a ready smile. After meeting
several. bilingual people, she was
introduced to and subsequently
tutored by an Oxford-educated
Monagask. Contrary to the cold
image of the French, LaPat claims
those in Monaco “are the most
hospitable people I have ever met. ’ ’
LaPat’s research at the institute
was conducted from the Ramage
(St. Raphael Naples, Genoa) rather
than from the famous Calypso; the
latter is used solely for ﬁlming
Cousteau’s television specials.
“Each day I was there, I learned a
new technique, because everyone
really got involved and they wanted
me to learn a lot,” LaPat said.

The research focused on the
bacteria level caused by the
dumping of raw sewage into the
sea.A sewage outlet was planned
near one of the beaches. The
engineers who planned it contended
the current would disperse the
waste particles, instead of throwing
them onto the beach. The institute
tested by following the ﬂow of a dye,
rhodium, from the proposed outlet
site. The institute’s prediction that
the site was unfit was proved when
the rhodium surfaced on the beach
just a few days later. V
From this first-hand experience,
LaPat compared European and
American treatment of sewage.
European treatment of waste
sewage is extremely primitive,
compared to ours. But they don’t
have our problem of industrial
pollution, because they don’t have
any industry in Monaco.” The
revenues the island generates come
chieﬂy from gambling and tourism,
so the main industrial pollution is
likely to be dirty glasses and sheets.

“When I went to Monaco, there I
had three goals in mind: to learn a
whole lot about water pollution, to
meet Cousteau, and to meet
royalty,” LaPat said. The first two
goals came easily. To fulﬁll the
third, LaPat wrote a letter to
Princess Caroline, explaining she
was in town to work at the institute
for a couple months and that she
would like to meet the Princess
sometime. '

A few days after she mailed the
letter, a friend of LaPat’s told her
Princess Caroline was at a nearby
hotel. In jeans and a T-shirt, Laurie
was reluctant to approach rogalty.
Her friend, however, insisted she
go; ‘.‘ It was really neat. I went up to
her and said “Hi, I’m Laurie LaPat.
Are you Princess Caroline? And we
ended up talking for a half hour.”
The Princess had received LaPat’s
Letter that morning, and knew
exactly who she was. ’

Cousteau, LaPat says, is nice,
sincere and dedicated. ‘ ‘He’s really
concerned about what’s happening
to the environment, and what’s
happening to the water. He gave a
lot of speeches on the water
pollution.” Cousteau often travel-
led to the Continent and to the
United States, but the closeness of
his crew, alongwith the times she
worked directly with him, left LaPat
with an affinity for Cousteau.

LaPat’s friends at the institute
often took her out. She saw a
concert featuring a band called
Martin’s Circus, which played old

Beach Boys songs in French. A day
at a secluded nude beach left her
crisp all over.

With her training in spectropho-
tonomy, water sample collection,
and nitrate, phosphate and bacteria
testing behind her, the institute has
invited Laurie to work as a paid

go back to visit all my friends,” she
said, “but I don’t know if they’d pay
me enough to survive over there.”
A gallon of gas costs at least $3 in
Monaco, and a can of tuna costs $4.

LaPat is taking a physics course at
Pitt.Her other classes are at
Chatham, where she also teaches
swimming. In her spare time, she
plays guitar, ﬂute and tennis.
Unfortunately, LaPat rarely gets a

chance to see her favorite sea
animal, the dolphin, in Pittsburgh.
Dolphins are very friendly—easy to
get to know,” she explained. But
she stilllikes Pittsburgh, especially
the hills. “Pittsburgh has a lot to
offer, if people take the time to
enjoy it.”

Studying sewage may not \ be
everyone’s idea of how to spend a
summer, but you couldn’t tell LaPat
otherwise.

“Another Man, Another Chance" Another Hit

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
Pill News Staff Writer
"‘Another Man, Another Chance”
Directed by Claude LeIouc_Ii.

“Another Man, Another
Chance’ ’ is a beautiful and sensitive
‘romantic ﬁlm set in the Old West. It
deals with a fragile French
immigrant -and a simple country
veterinarian.

Written and directed by French
man Claude Lelouch, the ﬁlm is
offbeat in its treatment of the old
romantic theme of two people, a
widow and a widower, who are
destined to find each other,
although they ﬁrst meet 80 minutes
into the ﬁlm.

iThe ﬁlm couples macho James
Caan and heavenly Genevieve
Bujold in its main roles.

Caan is a stubborn veterinarian,
who has trouble relating to anything
but his animals. This upsets his
pregnant, city-bred wife, Jennifer
Warren, who tells Caan she is sick
of ‘being alone with his animals.

Running parallel to this story is!

S

 

that of Genevieve Bujold. She is the
unhappy daughter of a middle-class
baker, who has arranged a marriage
between her and a wealthy French
soldier.

Through the ﬁrst 80 minutes of
the ﬁlm, these two plots lead up to
Caan and Bujold’s inevitable
meeting, when their lives are at
their lowest ebb.

Bujold vetoes the arranged
marriage, and moves in with a Paris
street photographer, who later
becomes her husband; The couple
seeks a new life in America.

Meanwhile, Caan is anxiously‘
awaiting the birth of his and
Warren’s son; he wants his
marriage to succeed.

Although Lelouch is a French
director, he has a knack for
portraying the brutalities of the 19th
century American West.

Caan has to deliver his son, and

both Caan and Bujold’s mates are
killed py outlaws.
° Caan’s wife is raped and killed by
a disgusting three-man band of
criminals, while Caan is away in
town.

Bujold’s husband is killed when a
father-and-son outlaw team storm
into her husband’s photography
-shop, demanding thephotos he took
of them on the street.

Although it takes 80 minutes for
Bujold and Caan to cross paths, the
wait is well worth it.

/

Caan seems to be getting better
with every new role. He is by no
means in Lawrence Olivier’s class
but he has the essential ingredients
of most successful l970’s American
movie actors: he is easy to like,
believable and has an entertaining
screen presence.

Caan is like someone’s brother-
in-law or buffooning cousin. His.
intentions, although he is often
easily misled, are mostly good.

He meets Bujold while returning
from a local orphanage for children
of working parents or wayward
saloon hall girls, where Caan’s
8-year-old son and Bujold’s 7-year-
old daughter live.

Susan Tyrell plays the owner and
manager of the ‘orphanage——the

_ scarred woman with a heart of gold,

moxie and pioneer determination.
Both Caan and Bujold are loving
parents, who experience the tender
joy of each other’s company on
Sunday picnics with their children.
When the inevitable marriage
happens, it is by no means corny. In
fact, it is heartwarming. ’’

Bujold is one of today’s ﬁnest
actresses. Although not outwardly
sexual, with a street urchin’s ﬂat
chest and a wholesome but plain
face, she has a haunting, childlike
beauty and an innocence that is
compelling.

Despite her little girl exterior,’
Bujold gives a vivid performance as

a foreign widow with a daughter and
a struggling photography shop.
The movie’s problems are in
sound and editing. In some spots
the dialogue is all but inaudible; the
ﬁlm goes black in many frames,
ruining the movie’s continuity.

However, “Another Man,
Another Chance” is a beautifully
done, tender and uplifting love
story.

The American movie public
would be romantically richer if it
could see more of Lelouch’s work.

James Caan stars with Genevieve Bujold in “Another Man, Another Chance."

‘When ﬁrst listening‘ to this

some of the songs on it. They don’t
sound like the Olivia Newton-John

not, this is Newton-John’s latest

album is a miscellany of music.
This work has easy listening,
knee-slapping country, pop -and
even opera’, an unusual switch for
Newton-John. “.Don’t Cry For Me,

Cagers Corner KSU, 55-47  

By 303 LABRIOLA

inn _News Staff Writer
The Pitt Panthers stepped up to

Division I competition Saturday

night at the Field House and
responded with a dazzling defen-
sive display, stifling Kent State,
55-47.

Although Pitt’s offense faltered
in the ﬁnal 10 minutes of the game
(scoring only 10 points), the defense

was a hustling, ball-hawking gang

for the entire 40, allowing the
fewest points since the 1974 season
opener.

Tim Grgurich stuck with the
starting lineup that worked so well
against West Virginia Wesleyan,

v and so Larry Harris and Sonny

Lewis again found themselves
watching the opening minutes from
the bench.

Kent State jumped out to a 6-2
lead on three long jumpers, but
with Wayne Williams scoring six of
the next eight points, the Panthers
took the lead for good with 13:25
left in the half. '

Harris was inserted into the game
seconds later and quickly swished a
long jumper to give Pitt a lift
offensively. Williams, turning in
his second straight outstanding

_. performance, registered two quick

steals, . converting the second into a

. three-point play to put the Panthers

up by nine, 15-6.

Lewis made his first appearance
midway through the half,f. and in the
next eight minutes, the 6-3
sophomore registered seven points,

as Pitt widened the gap with 2:18
remaining.

The Golden Flashes were being
forced to take long shots by the Pitt
zone, and converted only 34 per cent
of its attempts in the ﬁrst half.
Burrell McGhee,. Kent State's
all-America candidate, brought a
30 point per game average into
the Field House, but was held to
eight ﬁeld goals and a total of 19
points. Pitt took a 10-point lead into
the locker room, 28-18.

Williams and Terry Knight
combined for seven points to open
the second half, and Pitt had its
biggest lead of the night, 35-20.
Moments later, Williams picked up
his third steal and the ensuing dunk
brought the crowd to its feet; Kent
State called a timeout down by
41-26.

From this point, the Panthers
began to get careless, turning the
ball over and not looking inside on
offense. Coupled with some
senseless fouls and a case of cold
shooting, Pitt was ableto put only
14 points on the board in the final
13:32. ‘

“We fouled too much once we got
the lead,” Grgurich explained.
“When you’re up by '17 points, you
want to be careful with the ball so
that the other team has to foul to
catch up. By fouling them, we gave
them a chance to catch up when the
clock was stopped.” _

“We ran our fast break pretty
well for a while and then we got
tired,” Knight said. ‘ ‘In the second

half, our turnovers off the break
came from mental errors that we
can eliminate.”

Sam Clancy picked up his fourth
personal foul with 10 minutes left in
the game, and Kent State
immediately began to assert itself
under the backboards. Clancy
fouled out with 3:48 to play and,
shortly after his exit, Pitt’s lead
dwindled to seven, 52-45.

Strickland replaced Williams,
another casualty to fouls, at the 2:30
"mark, and the Panthers went to a
semi-stall, consuming virtually all
theremaining time on their next
two possessions.

Harris ﬁnished with a game high
nine rebounds to go with 11 points
(the 44th consecutive game he has
hit double ﬁgures).

“This was as ﬁne an all-around
performance as I’ve seen Larry
have,” Grgurich said. “He played
good defense,§ he was aggresive
under the boards and when his
shots start to fall for him. . .look out.
At this stage in the season, I’d have
to say Larry is right where we want
him to be.”

Williams snatched scoring
honors for Pitt with 18 points on an
eight for 10 performance from the
ﬂoor, Knight added 14 points and
six rebounds and Strickland dished
out ﬁve assists as the Panthers
upped their record to 2-1. ~'

This is the ﬁrst time Pitt has been
over the .500 mark since the‘ 1974-75
season.‘

about any basketball game above
Pitt held
Kent State to 47 points at the Field
House Saturday night and’,
although it did win by scoring 55
points, the way the Panther defense
played, th'e margin of victory could
have been at least 20.

Pitt’s hustling, aggresive zone

shouldn’t have had a prayer of
beating a team playing a zone
defense the way textbooks say it
should.‘ _ _
Yet things became a little hairy
near the end, as the Panthers scored
only 10 points in the last 10 minutes,
and allowed the visitors to pull
within ﬁve points with under three
minutes left. What happened?
“Today was just a bad day
offensively,” Panther Wayne Wil-
liams said after he had one of his
best days scoring, a game-high 18
points on eight of10 shooting. “We
were getting the shots, but we just
couldn’t put it in. Last game (a

80-56 win over -West Virginia
Wesleyan) we made all our shots,
but tonight it was
opposite.” A
One Panther who had an off night
was senior Larry’ Harris. Harris,
usually good for at least 20 points,
hit for only 11 on ﬁve of 12 shooting.
Just under -50 percent isn’t bad
marksmanship for most, but Harris
has the kind of touch that allows him
to wake up at three in the morning,
blink twice, then throw in 11 of 15.

Still, Pitt had Kent State on the
ropes more than once, and could not
put it away. The Golden Flashes
(particularly McGhee, who had 13
of his 19 points in the second half),
ﬁnally started hitting on their poor
percentage shots, while the Panther
offense died.

“We stopped looking toward the
lioop,” Sonny Lewis said. Lewis’s
seven ﬁrst-half points helped spark

.the Panthers to 17 straight points

and a 28-18 intermission advantage.
Williams offered another explan-

just the.

ation for the late-game offensive
sputterings."

“Even though we won, the refs
were real bad,” Williams said.
“We won, that’s the main thing,
but they were bad. Usually, the
home team gets the benefit of the
doubt, but we get the ‘opposite
here.”

The ofﬁcials raised the ire of not
only Williams but of most Pitt fans
in the crowd of 3,133, as at least five
close calls all went against the
Panthers in the final minutes. Fans
hurled debris onto the court after
Williams’s ﬁfth foul put him out
with 2:32 left. Williams was the
second Panther to leave on fouls;
Sam Clancy exited with 3:48 to go,
picking up a technical foul on his
way to the bench. '

Clancy’s premature departure
left the Panthers weak under the
boards. The freshman star from
Brashear High is Pitt’s needed
presence under both backboards.
While he might not get all the
rebounds (he picked up a season--

low five Saturday), Clancy’s

physical style of play discourages
opposing big men from going‘up

with him too often, wearing them?

down by the end of the game, when
clutch rebounds often insure

victory.
“Sam’s a'big kid,” Lewis said.
“We need someone like that

underneath. Without Sam, we let
them slide through and pick up
some rebounds.”

“When Sam is in there, he
makes everyone else go,” Williams
said. ‘ ‘When someone comes in for
him, or anyone else, they have to
keep it going.”

Although no one is going to
replace Clancy, someone must
come through and pick up some of
his slack when he leaves the gain?“
If Tim Grgurich can ﬁnd that
someone, and keep the kind of
defense that has given up an
average of only 51 points the past
two games,-his job is much more
secure than many people think.

Pitt Third in Tourney C

By MARY S. HUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Writer
After a heartbreaking one-
loss to Slippery Rock Saturday
night, the Pantherette basketball

‘ team came back to defeat Edin-

boro, 77-74, yesterday, afternoon
and clinch third place in the Pitt
Women's Basketball Tournament
at the FieldiHouse.

The victory followed yesterday
morning’s 64-54 triumph over
Temple, which also lost to Pitt,
77-40, Friday night.

In its ﬁrst three games coach
Jean Balthaser said her team did a
“decent” job defensively, but

didn’4.,mnerate much offense.

“They were taking the outside

vshots instead of working the ball

inside,” she said. “They were too
impatient.”
Against Edinboro, Balthaser was
pleased with the team’s overall
play. - “We worked together on

offense and particularly with the

Balthaser said.

defense,” she said. “That’s
important.”
Against Temple, 6-5 center

Wanda Randolph had 16 points,
Barb Welsch, 14, Kathy Paczowsiki,
12 and freshman standout Debbie
Lewis, had eight.

“It’s always hard to make the
adjustments to college ball,”
“She (Lewis) had
a great game against Temple
Friday and played well defensively
against Slippery Rock, but she’s
often too impatient. Gradually,
she’ll -learn how to run the
offense——that’s her job.”

Lewis said she was nervous
before she played Friday, but that
she relaxed when ‘she ﬁrst touched
the ball. “College ball really is a
lot different from high school," she

said. “It’s a lot more agressive." V

Against Temple yesterday
morning Randolph and Paczowksi
again scored in double ﬁgures,

with 17 and 15 points respectively.
Stephanie Stripling added 12.

Starting forward Kim Raymond
thought the secohd game agairg.§.,_
Temple was _toucher because th'§
team was coming off a loss the
night before.

“It was a big loss, but coach
Balthesar said that if we learned
something from it, that was
important."

In the Slippery Rock game, with
less than two minutes to play, the
Pantherettes learned they could
score 10 points. Within 34
seconds, the score was tied, 69-69.
Using a Vfull—court press, the
Pantherettes forced a jump ball in
the Slippery Rock end with t.1v_
seconds left in the game. M
questionable foul was called as the
buzzer sounded. Sue Roslevege

.missed the ﬁrst free throw and

sank the second to give ..Slippery
Rock a 70-69 victory. 9 ~

   

The Pitt basketball team is 2-1, which, to those
fans with a functioning memory, is good news. But it
should be 3-0.

The Panthers beat Kent State with only a bit of
trouble—all of it in the final few minutes—Saturday
night at the Field House, bringing cheers and sighs of
relief from a crowd that again owed its weight to
students. But since the Golden Flashes featured an

    
   
    
   
 

ering a 17-point lead was unsettling.

Pitt has played three stiffs. The first, whose
movement likely was caused by rigor mortis,
knocked the Panthers’ pre-season hopes into a
shallow grave. The other two, without much
kicking, allowed Pitt to bury them. Any trouble Pitt
V had with Kent State was‘of the Panthers’ making.

Pitt’s next two games come on the road, against
teams called the Purple Aces and the Red Flash. Af_
ter a game against the Athletes in Action, Pitt will
entertain a school (Wheeling) whose students are
outnumbered by Pitt’s football players only 5-1.
And end-of-year tournament in San Diegowill have
Pl" Competing With Purdue, San Diego and Ford-
ham. .

Before the tournament, the Panthers should lose
only to Athletes in Action. They should come out of
the tournament with a record near 6-2. And after
that, if some lineup changes aren’t made, they should

   
    
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
     
  
  
  

’ get killed.

   

Playing inspiration over talent may work against

 

‘ the West Virginia Wesleyans and the Evansville, Ind.

  

Purple Aces, but what happens when Maryland and
Syracuse come to town? Put Saturday night’s start-

   
  

A ' ers on the court against Cincinnati and they’ll come

  

back up the Ohio on a barge. They may hold the
Bearcats to 60 points, but they’ll score only 30.

Pitt has a chance to be a respectable team this
season. As respectable as, say, 16-9 or 17-8. Only
Cincinnati, Purdue (in the tournament), Syracuse
and Maryland will have a clear edge on the Panthers
in talent. Pitt willhave a chance to win every other
game this season-—even in Morgantown. Unless, of
course, the Panther talent is on the bench.

  
    
  
  
   
  
 

 

offense that was so disastrous the idea of Pitt squand-

magazine can propose a Mideast peace plan, I can of-
fer a starting lineup to the Pitt basketball team. Here
it is:

SAM CLANCY: If any man shorter than 6-6 can
play center, it is Sam Clancy. His defensive rebound-
ing and intimidating style are enough to keep him in
the lineup; if he could become a bigger part of Pitt’s
offense. he would give Larry Harris some healthy

 

competition in the leader-by-example category. He is
incredibly agile for a man of his build (early
Westinghouse Bridge) and, with help underneath,
can play 40 minutes.

LARRY HARRIS: Harris’s shot is enough to
make him a valuable weak forward, but his rebound-
ting ability—when he wants it to be—-makes him
valuable underneath on defense. If a lineup can be
found that does not leave the Panthers with a crying
need—other than shooting——Harris would be best
used as a roaming forward.

TERRY KNIGHT: Knight is dependable and ver-
satile, and would work best in this line up as a for-
ward. He picks up Clancy’s slack on the offensive
boards, is a good shot and will move to the basket
with or without the ball. He can dribble the ball if it
becomes necessary, but is strong enough to take
punishment inside. He isintelligent on the court and
not want to lose his head. . .

WAYNE WILLIAMS: It took‘ Williams two
seasons to make the transition from high school cen-
ter to college guard, but he’ll have two seasons to en-
joy the switch if his ‘knee can stand it. Williams has
become an excellent defensive guard and has retaineu
the inside moves and leaping ability that made him an

  ‘A Potentially Powerful Father Starting Quintet

effective high school big man. He can handle the
ball, though Pete Maravich need not tighten his
socks. And, though Williams has been down more
than once, he never has quit.

SONNY LEWIS: At guard, Lewis is about as pure
as is Monongahela River near the Homestead Works.

But the only thing suspect about him as a player was
his attitude, and that has improved to a point at
which he accepts second-line status, at least in public.
His problem is much what Williams’s was—how to
become as dangerous 30 feet from the basket as 30
inches over it.

This lineup would not be without its problems.
Rebounding would not_ of necessity be a lost
cause—Harris and Knight are not strong forwards,
but Williams and Lewis would help with their ability
to leap with most forwards and any guards. ‘

Negotiating that treacherous area behind the half-
court line would not be so difficult as many would
believe. Williams, with help from Lewis and Knight,
will be able to keep possession long enough to give
Pitt a decent shot. Terry Peavy or another of the
point guards could help against a press. Whatever
Pitt would lose through clumsy ballhandling would
be offset by having two guards who have extra-
ordinary moves to the basket.

[Each of these players canscore, though getting
C ancy many shots Wlll be difficult as long as he is the
only full-time rebounder. '

The bench would be a good one. Scott Nedrow
can shoot. Ed Scheuermann is big. Pete Strickland
is able to handle the ball. Peavy is quick. Bob
Haygood is quick and a hustler. Each of these
players could help the team, if used wisely.

_ The “lain Droblem one would encounter with this
lineiup involves attitude. Several of Pitt’s best

The Pitt men’s swim team
traveled to Penn State Saturday for
a relay meet, ﬁnishing second in a
ﬁeld of 13 teams.

_ Pitt’s highlight of the meet was a
first place in the 2000 meter
freestlye relay by Dale Pﬂaumer,
Bob Clemmer, ‘ Jeff " Trew and
Mickey Termin. Their time of
19:05.07 bettered the old record by

.- . .23 seconds.

According to Pitt coach Dick
Bradshaw, “The races were all
close—we just lacked the depth,
especially in the backstroke event. ’ ’

The winner of the relay was the
University of North Carolina which
Pitt beat Thursday in a dual meet at
Trees Pool.

The powerful Tar Heels led
throughout most of the meet, until
the Pitt divers turned in a
remarkable performance in the
three meter diving. Scott Winkler,
Chris Mano and Pat Greenwell
captured ﬁrst, second and third in
that event. This gave the Panthers a
two-point lead going into the last
event—the 400-yard freestlye relay.

In this event, the Panthers finished

Although the Pantherette
swim team lost their season opener
to Princeton Friday night, 70-61,
the team was pleased with their
performance.
“Individually, everyone swam
really well," said co-captain Kathy
Stetler.

All-America Stetler set a Pitt
team record in the 500-meter
freestyle with a time of 5:10.67.
She also won the 100-meter
freestyle (53.00) and the 200-meter

Pitt, which finished behind
winner Lehigh, host Penn State,
Clarion and Michigan State in the
tournament, returns to regular-
season play this weekend; it visits
Lycoming on Friday and travels to
15th-ranked Bloomsburg State
Saturday.

“I think we should do well
against Lycoming,” Adams said.
“And this tough tournament
should help us get ready for a team
like Bloomsburg.”

Swanson shattered the 200-yard
backstroke record with times of
1:54.33 and 1:54.65.

s Ligiemen for PSU Loss

By KAREN KADILAK
Offensive linemen.
When they do well, hardly anyone notices.
don’t,‘the whole world hears about it.

When they

Take the much talked about Pitt-Penn State game, for 1

example._ The Pitt offensive line, sufferingthrough its first
real off day of the season, shouldered much of the blame for
the Panthers’ heartbreaking 15-13 loss to the Nittany Lions at
Pitt Stadium.

The offensive line, many said (including one of the an-
nouncers who broadcasted the game nationally for ABC),
was to blame when quarterback Matt Cavanaugh was dum-
ped a season-high five times by a sack-crazy Penn State
defense. Critics contended the offensive line’s inability to
stop the consistent Lion pass rush forced Cavanaugh to hurry
his passes, and allowed Penn State defenders to grab three in-
terceptions. A

Yes, the offensive line did have a sub-par game. But why
place most of the blame on its collective shoulders? Why not
say Pitt had an off day, or that Penn State was the luckier, or
better-coached and better-prepared team?

Cavanaugh had an off day, too. But why blame the offen-
sive line for his substandard game?

Cavanaugh, no matter how super he is, is entitled to an off
day now and then. The best quarterbacks have had them, and
great quarterbacks will have them in the future.

It certainly helps, the quarterback when his line has one of-

its better days, but a quarterback can’t be guaranteed a solid
performance from his offensive front wall. '

There are too many “ifs” for such a situation to exist all
the time. -

The Pitt offensive line could point to a million different
reasons why it didn’i have a good day against Penn State.
Two important factors were too many team mistakes and
busted assignments.

George Link, a member or the Panthers’ offensive line at
right offensive guard, said he was called offsides on one play
in the third quarter, missed his blocking assignment on the
next play, and allowed his man (Penn State defensive tackle
Bruce Clarke) to sack Cavanaugh on the play after.

Those three plays amounted to about aquarter of a foot-
ball field in yardage.

It’s a shame the Panthers’ offensive line had an off day in
such an important game. It also is unfortunate the offensive
linemen had to conclude what has been a good season on a
sour note.

It’s an even bigger shame they received so much of the
blame for their te_am’s defeat.
