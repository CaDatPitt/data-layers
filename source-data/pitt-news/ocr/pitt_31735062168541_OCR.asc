 Universitv Parking Deficit
Remains Campus Problem

 .
Construction

Holds Curb
On Parking

by MARSHA REHNS
The solution to the Uni-
versity's parking problem is
three or four years away,
Acting Chancellor David
Kurtzman stated yesterday.
By 1969 and 1971 two
buildings with 700 and 500 park-

/____ing spaces will have been con-
H" structed, but, until then, metered

spaces and garages near the med-
ical center will be the chief
parking area.

The City Council has demand-
ed that plans for all new build-
ings following the new engineer-
ing building and Crawford Hall
nmst include parking facilities
before construction will be ap-
proved.

The University has no control
over which areas of the street
are metered. Thedecision is sole-
ly that of the city, Dr. Kurtzman

,»"«, explained. He pointed out that

any University parking facilities
would be metered although stu-
dents could deposit, at one time,
enough money to last the entire
day.

Present construction has cut
down the existing parking areas.
The increase in freshmen next

fall, as well as additional faculty
members to teach them, will
heighten the parking shortage.
The University is currently un-
derwriting a garage on Lothrop
St. and has contracted the park-
ing areas on O'Hara St. and be-
hind Syria Mosque, drawing com-

,plaints from the 20th Century"

Club. Kurtzman mentioned the
possibility of underwriting an-
other garage in conjunction with
Carnegie Institute of Technology,
but there are no definite plans.

Parking could also be made
available on ‘Engineering Hill,
although this area would be in-
acessible for some professors. A
city plan for mass transit might
also lessen the problem, Dr.
Kurtzman said.

Political Union To Petition

and tentative programs.

The constitution V’ states that the Union shall “serve as a non-
partisan programming group to stimulate critical thinking on social
and political issues by balanced programming, to increase the pro‘-

gramming resources of the mem-
ber groups, to plan campus-wide
programs, and to provide a means
of interraction between mem-
bers.”

Presently, members of the
Union are the National Associa-
for the Advancement of Colored
People, Young Republicans, Young
Democrats. Society for Conserva-
tive Studies, Collegiate Council
United Nations, Liberal
Union, Liberal Forum, Interna-

Parking Cure
Not Feasable

At Present

by NAN ISEN

A solution to the Universi-
tzy’s parking problem does
not seem feasible in the near
future. T-his conclusion was
reached -by Captain William
G. Fisher, a representative

— of the University physical

planning _committe; Edward
Jensen of the Pittsburgh
Port Authority; and Anthony Mis-
cimarra, a city traffic engineer,
at a forum held Wednesday in
the SU Ballroom.

The purpose of a street is “to
move traffic, people and goods,
the traffic being secondary,” ac-

cording to Miscimarra. He stated,

that parking is permitted only
where there is extra space on a
given street. He brought out the
fact that Oakland is not only the

~ cultural and educational center

of Pittsburgh, but also home of
many businesses, and largest
medical center in the tri-state
area. This alone causes much
traffic in the area, and the streets
are needed to move the traffic.
In response to the proposal for
four or eight hour parking me

ters, Miscimarra stated that the.

installation of meters must “sat-
isfy the needs of the most num-
ber of people.” He also stated
that professional people who start
work before the beginning of
classes would take the space. The

two hour meters help those peo- '

ple with short errands in ‘the
area. Without these meters, peo-
ple would park illegally, con-
gesting the streets and causing
more accidents.

Debate Team Defeats
Illinois State In Series

Two members of the Wil-
liam Pitt Debate Union
(WPDU) defeated a team
Illinois State University in a
public debate series before

eight high school audiences
this week in Cleveland, Ohio.
The results of the two- day
series, showed WPDU’s Elliot Zel-
vdow, junior in political science,
and Ken Holecko, sophomore in

pre-law, winning ﬁve of the eight '

debates and capturing 15
24 judges’ votes. .

The Cleveland series was the
second in the WPDU. schedule.
Two weeks ago the WPDU de-

of the

baters defeated a team from Em-
ory University eight out of ten
debates. The next series, 
the University of Alabama, will
be held in early December, and
the teams will visit high schools
in the Greater Pittsburgh area.
The series are held in conjunction
with the Office of Admissions
and annually reach some 40,000
students. ‘

The topic for the Cleveland
series, was “Resolved That the
US Should Withdraw Its Conven-
tional Military Forces from Eur-
ope.’f Thomas Kane, associate di-
rector of the WPDU ,accomp_anied
the speakers and served as mod-
erator ﬁor the debates.

Asymmetrical Conflict

Levontin Discusses Arab-Israeli Conflict

by GEORGE EDELMAN

“At no time was Palestine
an exclusively Arab state, it
never ceased to be settled by
Jews,” emphasized Dr. Avig-
dor Levontin at a lecture last
Tuesday in the Cathedral. Dr.
Levontin stressed this fact as
the’ core of the “asymmetrical
conflict” between Modern Israel
and the Arab states.

Adding that the Arab concept
of Palestine “as a state where
Jews had inﬁltrated” was his-
‘torically false, Levontin noted
that the urban class included
many Christian Lebanese mer-
chants.

By selling land to the influx
of Jewish immigrants, he ex-
plained, the Arabs knew what
~.th:.ey.~  s.rs,..€1°ins,-...

   

        

   

hey ..‘.’.V¢f? '0

knowingly “changing the condi-
tions of population, the economy,
and the power with Palestine,”
he declared emphatically.

At the close of World War 1,
Arab and Zionist delegations~sub-
mitted representatives to the
Peace Conference at Versailles,
he continued, and “both parties
pledged themselves to the closest
cooperation” over the future of
the ,newly - established Balfour
Declaration of 1917. The major

' signiﬁcance implicit in this pledge,

added Dr. Levontin. was that
Palestine was not thought of as
an Arab state by either party.
“In 1919, the conditions of Pal-
.estine were repeatedly discussed
and, investigated by disinterested
parties, ‘he said, and “all these
re . r-ts. .sta.t¢d that Palestine. 

   
  

not an Arab land; the reports rec-
ommended partition. The Peel
Report of 1936,” mentioned Levon-
tin, “is the best analysis to this
day.” l

Dr. Levontin discussed the al-
ways volatile refugee problem.
“Territory,” he maintained, “is
not the real issue.” For this prob-
lem of refugees, there exists “no
other solution except that of ne-
gotiation,” he declared. Both par-
ties must be willing to negotiate
and to compensate their respec-
tive emigrants was his personal
view.

Levontin declared that “Arabs
are refugees in their own coun-
tries; they are ethnically, religi-
ously, and socially the same. They
are used as political pawns for
selffish personal reasons of pow-
er. The UN resolution on the ref-

 

many Arabs don't want to come I

back as loyal citizens, but to sub-
vert the new state.” He added
that about 500,000 Jewish ref-
ugees were forced to ﬂee Arab
lands in the early 1950's, and this
must also be considered as a part

of an overall solution to the ref- *

ugee problem.

Interfraternity Council Revises

Rules Governing Varsity Athletes

by PAUL STOLLER

The Interfraternity Coun-
cil (IFC) voted Tuesday
night to revise the rules gov-
erning the eligibility of var-
sity athletes in interfrater-
nity sports. In addition, a
number of important IFC policies
and communications were also
announced.

After the roll call of delegates,
Ken Frederick, president of IFC,
gave his report. Frederick an-
nounced that applications are
available for the chairmanship of
IFC winter rush.

Frederick then reiterated that
the'best policy on mixers is for
the fraternities to use Friday
nights instead of week nights for
such parties. He added that al-
though it is impossible for IFC
to check mixers on week nights,
neighbors can still telephone com-
plaints.

Frederick concluded by an-
nouncing the forthcomins‘ Nation-
al Interfraternity Conference to
be held on Dec. 1, 2, and 3 in
New Orleans.

Ed Licher, IFC athletic chair-
man, presented a revision in ‘the
IFC athletic policy, which was
passed by IFC. The revision states
that any varsity athlete who has
completed one-half an athletic
season will be ineligible for in-
terfraternity sports for the en-
suing school year unless he is
judged eligible by the Intramural
Athletic Committee.

Parker Enright, assistant dean
of men, added that the coaches
feel that if a man plays half an
athletic season, he has an unfair
advantage in training techniques.
The varsity athlete should not

participate in interfraternity ath-
letics because of this training ad-

‘vantage.

A number of questions were
raised concerning officiating the
IFC athletic events. Art Popkave,
a member of ZBT, asked if it is
possible for the Athletic Depart-
ment to supply ‘officials at IFC
athletic events. Dean Enright
agreed that the officiating at such
ment. He commented that be-
sports -events needed improve-
cause of IFC’s improved ﬁnancial
status, the subsidizing of ref-
eree’s from the Athletic Depart-
ment is a distinct possibility.

Unsolved For Present Time

(Continued from Page 1)

Pitt News, explained that the
main problem of large cities is
transporting people. The construc-
tion of new parking areas, ac-
cording to the Transit Authority,
'is self-defeating, because these
areas do not alleviate any of the
congestion on the streets, and
only result in the spending of
large sums of money for con-
struction. Jensen emphasized that
“a parking garage uses property
better used for some other pur-
pose.” According to Jensen, the
new concept of the Port Author-
ity .is to develop a new rapid
transit system for the city, and

to encourage people to use it.
According to Fisher, plans are
being made to have parking lots
under a few of the University’s
new buildings. He reminded that
parking is available now at a

minimal cost in the many pri-
vate parking lots beyond Forbes
Field.

Students had proposed the
printing of special stickers al-
lowing a ten minute grace period
after classes to reach meters. Mis-
cimarra rejected this measure be-
cause 'it would cause a break
down in the present enforcement
system.

A Case of Irresponsibility

C  munity should tolerate. When
' _ a writer in an American

__x_ ..

by Fred Frank, Editor - in - Chief

Irresponsible journalism is
something that no free com-

newspaper makes misstate-
ments and then labels them
facts he should be exposed.
Such a person is Milton K.
Susman, a columnist for the
Jewish Chronicle, the week-
ly published by the Pitts-
burgh Jewish Publication  ‘
and Education Foundation. MK MAM” .
In a recent article, Susman authored a string of prevaracations about a
Pitt student, Mahmoud Mamdani.'Mamdani came up for discussion be-

    

 

’ cause he had argued in a parlimentary debate that the establishment of

the State of Israel should be condemned. Susman was attacking argu-
ments made during this discussion sponsored by the William Pitt Debate
Union. 

Susman made the following statement about Mamdani:

“Besides, who are the precocious adolescents who dare to embark upon these
turgid waters? One is Mahmoud Mamdani whom you would expect to play the devil’s
disciple. He is from Uganda of Pakastani origin and is one of man;/"such students
whom the Arabs have used to infiltrate American colleges and universities.

“His bread, butter and tuition at Pitt depend upon his pounding the old Arab line

 that Israel was established by an alliance of Zionist colonialism and British imperialism.

and the Arabs had been driven out by Jewish aggression!”
That was what Susman said. Here are the facts:

> Mandani is not of Pakastani origin. He was born in Bombay, India. His
family has never lived in Pakistan and does not presently live there. He
has lived in Tanzania (Tankanyika) for four years and for the past 12
years his family has lived in Uganda. Mamdani is a citizen of Uganda.

5 Uganda has maintained close diplomatic relations with Israel and Is-
rael has sent technicians and teachers to Uganda. An extensive trade,

 

MR. SUSMAN

cultural and economic agreement is shared by Uganda and
Israel. .

> Mamdani’s “bread, butter and tuition” is not coming from
any Arab source. He is a United States State Department
Scholar. His tuition is paid for by the University and
his other expenses are paid for by the African-American
Institute, a division of the Agency for International Devel-
opment (AID). AID is a part of the State Department.

> Mamdani is not a member of the University chapter of
the Organization of Arab Students. His activities have in-

Students Organization and the Hill Education Project. Last
March members of the senior class selected Mamdani the
outstanding member in the junior class of 1966.

5 As an American Jew and supporter of the State of Israel, I am well.
aware that there. are Arab students who attempt to spread anti-Israeli

propaganda on American campuses. But I have known Mamdani for over

two years and am certain he has never indulged in such practices. Rather,

Susman’s complete lack of investigation of the facts in this instance
is painfully obvious. In this instance Susman’s ignorance borders on libel.
No responsible newspaper editor should let such a columnist print slander
simply because the editor feels the column will be “read.” This. is a. mock-

The Rationale

Fee for Graduate Students

by RALPH MANNING.
HOWARD AINISMAN, JIM JANIS

(The authors are executive
officers of Student Government)

We would like to take this
opportunity to consider some
of the questions which have
been raised about the recent
Student Government (SG)
resolution calling for an ex-
tension of the activities fee
to full-time graduate stu-
dents.

We feel it is necessary to
reiterate the purposes for
this action. First, full-time
graduate students do partici-
pate in the events and the
organizations supported by
activities fee monies. Each
time a graduate student
picks up a Pitt News for ex-
ample, he avails himself of
the many thousands of dol-
lars allocated to the News
for publication expenses.

‘ Both the Health Professions

and the School of Law, fur-
thermore, are represented in
the Owl. The Pitt News and
the Owl are official publica-
tions of the University.
Should we refuse them funds
because everyone’s picture
does not appear in them?
The merits of these publica-
tions should not be judged
by these criteria.
Participation in the Pub-

7 lic Affairs Series of the Stu-
~ dent Union Board by grad-

uate students is another ex-
ample of graduate students
taking advantage of events
paid for by the undergrad-
uates. Whether or not all
members of the University
Community can attend these
lectures is beside the point;
someone must pay for them.
Cannot the graduate stu-
dents help?

Graduate students ,must
pay $5 for Homecoming tick-

_ BUSlN_E$8 

 

graduates will pay $3.50.
The reason for this inequity
is obvious: undergraduates
pay a $5 activities fee, grad-
uate students do not.

We think tha.t graduate
students should support
Homecoming, the Pitt News,
etc., as they do on other uni-
versity campuses. All full-
time students, both graduate
and undergraduate, at the
University of California at
Berkely, the University of
Michigan, Pennsylvania State
University, and West Vir-
ginia University contribute
equally to an activities or
Student Union fund. We Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh under-
graduate students must now
carry this burden alone.

Although the relative mer-
its of the various applica-
tions for activities fee funds
this term were adequately
discussed at the last SG
meeting, it seems necessary
to again state -the basis for
deciding who gets the mon-
ey. The prudence of the ‘Al-

locations Committee is to be _

commended. They have dis-
tributed the monies respon-
sibly by judging each re-
quest on its own merits.
Even SG’s requests are giv-
en no special consideration.
The money allocated to us
this term will be used for
supplementing the costs of
the Student Directory and
providing operating expenses
for the Li-beral Arts Cabinet.
The Directory, purchased and
used by both graduate and
undergraduate students,
costs the students only 30

‘cents this year, a reduction
in price of 40 percent.

We wish that all organi-
zations could get the total
amount of money they re-
quested; this has never been
mathematically possible.
One way to increase the
amount of money available
for distribution is to remove
the present inequity in the
system by charging full-
time graduate students $5
per term. To increase the
undergraduate fee would
only make the system more
inequitable.

Besides the beneﬁts that
graduate. students currently
obtain from the activity fee
without contributing, addi-

- tional beneﬁts can be obtain-

ed if a graduate fee is es-
tablished. The Graduate So-
cial Organization, now seek-
ing University recognition,
could get the money it needs
for programs. After the fee
is collected from graduate
students, the impetus for
graduate student participa-
tion in their own activities
would be increased.

We recommend, therefore,
that the University collect
a $5 activities fee per term
from all full-time graduate
students beginning in the
fall term, 1967. The fund
will be distributed by the Al-
locations Committee as now
established, with the addi-
tion of a graduate student
member. It is time that grad-
uate students contribute
money for the support of
activities in which they par-
ticipate.

C ountry: Little Sr Csonka

by GEORGE LIES

Next Monday is Halloween, but the Panthers may see
ghosts beginning at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow when they visit
Syracuse’s Archbold Stadium. On Saturday afternoons,
ghosts like Floyd Little and Larry Csonka haunt those grounds.

Between the two of them, Little and Csonka have rushed for
936 yards and ten touchdowns. That is 360 yards more than the
entire Panther back-ﬁeld has mustered.

Fullback Mike Raklewicz has averaged 3.9 yards per carry and
tailback Joe Jones 2.9. Little and Csonka average 4.6 yards between
them. i ‘

“Little does everything well,” said scouting coach Darrell Lewis.
“There's nothing he cannot do. Since opposing teams have used dou-
ble coverage on Little, both running and passing, Csonka has aver-
aged just under ﬁve yards per carry.

“They are two excellent runners,” continued Lewis.

Even Little and Csonka weren’t enough for Syracuse in the be-

ginning of the season. That's when the Orangemen lost two games '

by wide margins to Baylor and UCLA, two teams they needed to
beat for a bowl. bid. (

The spirits may be on the side of nSyracuse’s coach Ben Schwartz-
walder tomorrow since his team is looking for their fifth straight
win. And especially since Panther coach Dave Hart broke his crystal
ball. ‘

In the beginning, after the Panthers were drubbed‘ by Ulcans,
Hart realized his team would have problems. Yet he also said, “I
think we will have a football team here this season.” However, in-
juries to 12 regulars in one game or another caused cracks to form
in Hart's optimism.

The Panther record now" stands at 1-5 and the next win could
come next year since Notre Dame, Miami of Florida, and Penn State
ﬁnish out the schedule. Under the circumstances, Hart is discour-
aged, but he still displays that encouraging look (to students and
fans) which a new coach brings to a school. i

_ Before Saturday's game, Hart was faced again with an injury
problem. This time he had to replace the quarterback, Ed J.ames. He
tried’ to work both the second-string signal caller Mike Elliot and
switched over defensive man Bob Bazylak.

“Bazylak’s a quick little guy, aside arm thrower,” Hart said.
‘‘He’s a small guy, but he has a lot of spark. Maybe that’s what we
need.

“I have no alternative but to go with the little guy, but I won’t
know until game time who will start (at quarterback),” continued
Hart. “Elliot has been playing there, and he has the experience.”

Bazylak has not been working at the quarterback position. And
a back injury has hindered his progress since he was a freshman. For
the season, Elliot has completed 38 per cent of his passes for 151
yards. Except for the second-half against Army, Elliot has seen very
limited action in two other games.

Trick or treat tomorrow, Syracuse won’t be making any offers.
Especially- since the Panther diddy bag has holes.

7-0 Win;

Rulebook Co sts Cubs Two Touchclowns

by ROY JACOBS

Rules can be awfully tricky
Although they do keep a
football game somewhat or-
ganized, they tend to get in a
team’s way. And it may have
been a misinterpretation ‘of the
rules which cost the Panther
Cubs a 7-0 loss, yesterday, to the
Kent State freshmen.

“You play the game accord-
ing to the rules,” said coach Steve
Petro afterwards, “and some of
the rules were against us. I’m
not saying anything against the
referees. They called as good a
game as they could haVe.”

What Petro was complaining
about was the 63 yard touch-
down pass to Denny Ferris that
was called back because of an
ineligible receiver downﬁeld. Ac-

Banner feels Handelman should

cording to Petro, he wasn’t in-
eligible.

“The official said our man
couldn’t be downﬁeld while the

ball was in the air; but as the

rule was explained to us before
the season started, a downﬁcld
blocker is permissable on a pass
as long as the pass is thrown be-
hind the line of scrimmage.” The
play was obviously a screen pass
with Ferris receiving the ball
four to seven yards behind the
line of scrimmage. The decision,
however, is the officials.

But there is no rulein football
that stops a team from driving

V 97 yards for a touchdown with

less than four minutes left in a
game for avictory. It wasn’t so
much an effort by Kent as a
team as it was an individual ef-
fort by halfback Garland Wilson.

“That type ofmistake happens
because of a player’s anxiety,”
said Petro of Wilson’s run.

One other rule got in the Cubs’
way, only this one isn't subject to

  

any interpretation. Kent State
had a ﬁrst down on their own
20 late in the fourth quarter.
Kent quarterback Steve Trust-
dorf was jarred loose from the
ball. Cub cornerback Frank Gus-
tine scooped up the loose ball
at the 12 and ran it into the end
zone for a touchdown and, at
the time, the lead.
Unfortunately for the Cubs,
there is a college rule that fum-
bles can’t be advanced after they

_are recovered. Two plays later

Dave Dibbley fumbled and Kent
recovered at the nine.

Rules notwithstanding, the loss
was still largely due to offensive
mistakes’ here and there. Indi-
vidual mistakes that shouldn't
be made. Four times the Cubs
were in scoring position inside
the Kent 15 and four times they
gave the ball away. There are
no rules preventing fumbles and

interceptions, but in the Cubs’

'case, ‘there oughta be a law.

esfed." Last week I called her 23 times and couldn't even make C:

who owns a Dodge Coronet. Now she goes to parties with him,
donces, football games, etc. Do you think I should call her again,
or should I forget her ond break her heart?

ICP Editor Discusses Vietnam

" by LINDA GOLDSTEIN
“At one and the "same time the United States declares we are
supported in Vietnam and that 80 per cent of the Vietnamese
people don't want our support," noted Leo Toribio at the Monday
evening Students for Peace meeting. Toribio, editor of the Inter-
Collegiate Press, has recently returned from serving an 11-month
stint for the U. S. Armed Services in Vietnam.

Upward Bound
Project Aids

pDeprived Kids

Is there a way to encourage
high school students from disad-
vantaged areas to work up to
their potential? The University is
participating in Upward Bound,
a program designed to answer
“yes” to this question. Accord-
ing to a report compiled by Dr.
Carmine P. Sebastian, project di-

F. rector, the program provides the
‘A selected students with “a golden

opportunity to become econom-
ically successful adults.”

Upward bound began with a
six-week summer program. Par-
ticipating students commuted to
the University for the ﬁrst ﬁve
-weeks and lived in the dormi-
tories for the last week. A sec-
ond phase, now in operation, is a
Saturday Program. Next summer,
the same students will again at-
tend classes, living on campus all
six weeks. They will participate
in the last phase of the program
during their senior year, when
they will again attend Saturday
classes.

Summer mornings. are devoted
to academic subjects, emphasiz-
ing English, mathematics, biology
and study skills. In the after-
noons, students attend biology
labs, ﬁne arts classes, extra-cur-
ricular activities, group and in-
dividual counseling meetings, tu-
toring sessions, and ﬁeld trips.

In the evenings, they studied
and went to cultural and rec-
reational activities, such as the
light Opera. a baseball game at
Forbes Field, a visit to the Play-
house, and bowling at the Strand

Alleys.

The project provided free street
car passes if they were needed
for transportation. It also fur-
nished books and supplies that
the students are allowed to keep,
plus a weekly allowance.

Dr. Sebastian stressed the need

for tutors in the Upward Bound ,

project. University students may
volunteer to tutor English, chem-
istry, biology, and mathematics
for the Saturday Program classes.
Any interested student should
call Ext. 517 for further informa-
tion.

“The United States Army is
still telling troops that 80 per
cent of the Vietnamese are Viet
Cong supporters, and this is
true,” Toribio stated. However,
Toribio pointed to statements in
the Saigon Observer to the effect
that the American cause is rein-
forced by Vietnamese support.

Toribio emphasized that “there
is a feeling of real futility while
trying to get more information
about Vietnam.” He-told how the
American troops are expected to
believe every fact on the war
written in such United States
publications as the Stars and
Stripes, the American newspaper.

According to Toribio, one of
our nation's best supporters is
the Hanoi propaganda machine,
which, he said, proclaims us as
a “peace-loving nation.” Instead,
they “blame the war on John-
son and MacNamara, whom they
call John and Mac,” Toribio re-
counted.

Toribio’s appearance was fol-

lowed by an address by Frank
Emspak, ﬁeld secretary for the
November 8 Mobilization Com-
mittee and chairman for the Na-
tional Coordinating Committee to
End the War in Vietnam. “Our
mobilization committee is calling
the nation to mobilize between
Nov. 5-8 to speciﬁcally bring our
point of View about Vietnam to
the American people at this
time,” Emspak emphasized.

He pointed. out that “this is-
sue is being ducked by most can-
didates and is not being discussed
in a serious way to give the
voters a choice.” Emspak felt
that “even though we lost battles
when our peace candidates ran,
we feel we have won a victory
in the last two months.
