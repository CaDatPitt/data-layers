Even adult

Mick Lichtenberg
For The Pitt News

At midnight on a cold Saturday morning,
dozens of people, many of whom were Pitt
students postponing studying for their rnid—
terms, cheered outside the Gamestop on
Forbes Avenue in celebration of the release
of the next iteration of the game that deﬁned
their childhoods.

“Where’s group six?” one employee yelled
into his megaphone after making his way
through the dense crowd to locate the next‘
party in’ line to pick up the anticipated game.

A faceless voice from within themass of
bodies hollered back, “About 20 feet thatway!”

The games for which these jubilant fans
crowded the sidewalk were “Pokemon X” and
“Pokemon Y,” the ﬁrstinthe highly anticipated
sixth generation of the blockbuster game se-
ries that began in 1996. Its popularity has not
waned, as the release of the latest games in
the franchise broke day- one sales records for
Nintendo’s 3DS console.

But there is still a division between those

‘ who are inclined to relinquish a Friday night

for a game release and those who don’t quite
understand the massive fan base behind what

Student racing team hosts car show for breast cancer

Luke Raber
‘ For The Pitt News

Passers—by turned their heads when they
heard the roar of a 600—horsepower engine
behind them, a sound unfamiliar to those
who normally hang out at the Cathedral of
Learning on a Saturday afternoon.
Dozens of exotic cars were parked next
to each other on either side of the street,
and spectators walked slowly, occasionally
stopping to appreciate each car’s unique
beauty.

Police blocked off a portion of Bigelow
Boulevard this past 'Saturday for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Formula Society of
Automotive Engineers Car Show. The show
began at 10 a.m., and owners drove most of
the cars on display away by 4 p.m.

Entry for attendees was free, while the
owner of each car on display made a ﬁve
dollar donation. Owners came and left
with their cars throughout the day. In the
early afternoon, more than 25 cars were
on display. .

The Pitt FSAE team, a group of 40 stu-

   

dents who design and build a team racecar
each year, organized the show. The annual
event began two years ago, and is spon-
sored by Feel Your Boobies, a nonproﬁt
organization based in Middletown, Pa.,
that promotes breast cancer awareness.
The organization was created after the

founder, Leigh Hurst, was diagnosed with A

breast cancer at age 33.

‘ Hurst discovered a lump in her breast with-

out any formal medical examination and
now encourages women to check them-

selves for breast cancer regularly -4 hence, ‘

the name of the organization.

Feel Your Boobies uses public events
such as Saturday’s car show to raise aware-
ness for this cause.

According to Jen Bracken, the recruit-
ment coordinator for the FSAE team, the
event raised $2,000 for Feel Your Boobies.

Bracken, a sophomore engineering
major, ran a booth that sold “Feel Your
Boobies” and Pitt FSAE T-shirts.

According to Bracken, the event had a
better turnoutthan it did the past two years
because the weather cooperated and many

" were willing to enter their cars in the show.

The show featured several types of cars,
ranging from ﬂashy and compact Mini Coo-

pers tdsleek and sporty Ferraris. The cars
were provided by various private owners,
businesses and car—enthusiast organiza-
tions, such as Pittsburgh Cars N’ Coffee
and the Bobby RahaljAutomotive Group.
Some cars, such as the Lexus LFA, drew
more attention than others. Spectators
swarmedthe vicinity of the Lexus, sur-
rounding it and slowly walking around,
it in order to get a view from each angle.
“My favorite is the LFA~because it has a
V10 engine,” saidjeff Smith, a sophomore
who attended the show. “End of story.”
Mike Laskin, a friend of Smith who is
also a Pitt student, preferred one of the few
SUVs at the show —— the Subaru Forester
XTI —— “because it has aturbocharger big-
ger than my head,” he said.
Most displays featured supercars such
as Lotus’ Elise and Exige models and the
Lamborghini Gallardo, while others fea-

- _tured modern rally-style _cars, such as the
Subaru Impreza STI. One car owner de-

cided to display from an entirely differ-
ent approach and took aparthis old VW
Beetle, suspending its interior and shell
with chains for spectators to observe.

A favorite among attendees was the Pitt

FSAE racecar, which a team of Pitt engi-

neering students built.

According to team treasurer Anthony
Grazigso, the team is divided into sub-
teamsthat leach focus on designing and
building "a different component of the race-.
car, such as the powertrain or suspension.
There is also a sub-team that focuses on
marketing. ‘ » \

A sub-team leader oversees aboutthree
or four students. The work of each sub-
team comestogether to create a vehicle
suitable for entry in the FSAE competition,
a national student contest of each car’s
acceleration, fuel economy, versatility and

. endurance. Judges also takethe car’s de-
sign, cost and manufacturing into account. '

Adam Paul, a sophomore mechanical

engineering major who heads the aerody-
namics and bodyworks sub-team within
FSAE, said that the team designs a new
car each year. Some years, aspects of the
design carry over from previous years, but
this year’s designis fresh. .,

Paul said that the cars the club uses are ‘
required to be kept under 100 horsepower. P

To meet this requirement, the Pitt team
built a racecar with an 85-horsepower en-
gine that reaches a top speed of 85 miles
an hour and can go from O to 60 miles per
hour in-3.5 seconds. .

The team noted that actually designing 7

the car is one of the less problematic pro-
cesses, and that the real challenge comes
from passing safety tests while keeping a
tight budget. Paul said the team needed to
determine whether the car will be safe if
it’s made out of light materials.

“If you are going to make it out of car-
bon ﬁber, you have to prove it’s as safe as
steel,” he said. I '

is marketed primarily as a child’s toy.

On Saturday evening, Pitt’s Japanese
Culture Association held its ﬁrst—ever Poke-
Fest in an attempt to bridge this gap.

“A lot of us college students are people
who played it back in the day  trading and
ﬁghting off of our. old, clunky Game Boys,”

senior information science major Vincent’

Agresti, the association’s vice president,
said. “So we just want to get that nostalgia

back for people who are still passionate

about it now.”

More than 100 people gathered in the
William Pitt Union’s Assembly Room for
PokeFest, which featured tournaments of
several generations of “Pokemon” games
and screenings of the original “Pokemon:
The First Movie” and the new “Pokemon:
Origins” television series.

The new show, a'reboot of the original

anime television series that began in 1997

and is still in syndication, drew a large
crowd, captivated by the re-imagining of
the beloved series. '

“I imagine that right now, in this room,
or in any classroom really, you’d probably
be able to ﬁnd that somewhere between
two—thirds to three-fourths of the people
in that room have played “Pokemon” at
some point, or have seen the cartoon,”
Agresti said.

Another factor in “Pokemon’s” massive
success is its universality. It has made an
incredible impact on the world, launching

-one of the most popular media franchises

in decades and raising several generations
of gamers across the globe. According to
a press release from Nintendo coinciding
with the launch of “Pokemon Black” and
“Pokemon White” versions in 2010, over
200 million copies of Pokemon game titles
have been sold since 1996.
David Van Etten, a senior English writ-
ing major currently working on a study

about capitalism in the “Pokemon” fran-
chise, considers the game series in par-
ticular a widespread global phenomenon.

“It’s interesting because it penetrates
through so many cultures,” he said.

During PokeFest, Van Etten eagerly
handed out a survey’ relatedto his study,
which included questions such as “How
important was in-game money to you while
playing the games?” and “To you, what is
the goal of ‘Pokemon’?”

Van Etten said he believes that the fran-
chise’s universality is fundamental to un-
derstanding its groundbreaking success.

Kiyomitsu Yui, a sociology professor at
Kobe University injapan, wrote an essay in
2010 noting that manyjapanese mangarand
anime, such as “Pokemon,” have managed
to ﬂourish in foreign countries.

According to Yui, these media did not
gain global traction until the early 1990s,
when the most acclaimed ‘examples of the
genre, such as Hayao Miyazaki’s “My Neigh-
borTotoro” and “Princess Monohoke” and

Katsuhiro Otomo’s classic “Aki_ra”, gained --

attention from a worldwide audience.

Yui also claims‘ in his essay that while
the stereotype of anirne as “dangerous” and
“full of violence and sex” does still exist, it
is now signiﬁcantly less prevalent than the
view of it as “a sophisticated, even avant-
garde art.” '

For “Pokemon,” public opinion is
strongly veered towardthe latter. If the

‘ buzz in the air throughout Saturday’s event‘

was any indication, the franchise won’t go
away anytime soon. 0 e
For many gamers, the series was their
ﬁrst foray intojapanese culture, an experi-
ence that thejapanese Culture Association

hopes it delivered to many Pitt studenj_;§;_    

through PokeFest. _
“That’s one of the things we’re trying

to do,” Agresti said. “We’re trying to get '

the people who really appreciate it and
the people who grew up on it, who maybe
moved past it to come back and say, ‘This is
what got me into Japanese culture.’” I _

Pittsburgh’s the most livable city? It’s time
to follow through on What rankings claim

Simon Brown
Columnist

If you live in‘Pi_ttsburgh and oc-
casionally check Facebook, then
you’ve surely seen every “Another
Reason Why Pittsburgh is Awe-
some” linkthat surfaces on aweekly
basis. The attractive image of the
city found in these rankings, how-
ever, whitewashes over one ugly re-
ality — the quality of life in many
black communities in this city.
Although the Steel City enjoys its
reputation as the “most educated”
and the “most livable city,” it also
tops the less glamorous°list of cities
with the highest percentage of its
black population living in poverty,
according to the 2010 US, Census.
Those highly—publicized acco-
lades seem little more than grim
ironies for many of the city’s resi-
dents. The city’s sizable university
population makes it the “most edu-

cated,” but the city also maintains
an achievement gap between black

. and white public school students

that stands at a sobering26 percent
when measured by PSSA scores.
What is more, “the most livable
city” tolerates nearly two-thirds
of its black children under the age
of 5 living below the poverty line.
Unfortunately, these facts
should come as no surprise to black
Pittsburghers who have lived in the
city throughout the past half cen-
tury —— or anyone acquainted with
the city’s recent history. The de-
struction of much of the historically
black and vibrant Hill District to lay
the foundation for Mellon Arena in
1960 displaced black families to fail-
ing housingprojects across the city,
often far from job opportunities.
Today, neighborhoods such as
Homewood, East Liberty, Larimer,
Lincoln-Lemington, Homestead
and much of the North Side still

retain the majority of the black
population. Their landscapes are
punctuated by dilapidated public
high-rises that marked an era of
increasing segregation and a col-
lapsing steel industry. Pittsburgh
has received praise for its robust
recovery from the latter, but it has
failed to correct the former.

The revitalization, unfortu-
nately,, has largely bypassed the
concentrated black neighborhoods.
The dominance of “meds and eds”
— medicine and education -— as
the new engines driving the city’s
economic strength has attracted a
young and well-educated popula-
tion to the city. Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon University not only attract
grants and employees for their ex-
tensive research operations, but
they also serve as gateways between

talented students from across the country
and national ﬁrms and hospitals.

In turn, these institutions and their em-
ployees attract businesses into their neigh-
borhoods — which accounts for the notable

' prosperity of Oakland and Lawrenceville,

and increasingly, East Liberty and Garﬁeld.
It’s not difﬁcult to see that education is the
central cog in this vehicle for metropolitan
development. But when institutions primar-
ily focus on attracting a creative class to Pitts— Q
burgh, rather than granting opportunities
to residents of neighboring communities,
the result is both economic and racial seg-

regation. , -

. The challenge, then, is to open the gates
to the city’s most dynamic institutions so the
next generation of black_ Pittsburghers can
‘also prosper. And just as no single actor alone
could successfully transform the city from a
steel town to the model 21st century city it is
today, all institutions must take responsibility
for including the black population.

Any solution, however, must begin with
the city’s educators, who provide marginal-
ized communities with the only possible path
out of poverty.

First, the Pittsburgh Public School District
must supplement existingprograms designed

to raise the achievement among students’

pronounced gap in grades and test scores.
Though the district directs considerable at-
tention to this problem, they only exacer-
bated it after recently closing schools that
overwhelmingly served black neighborhoods
and redirecting their students elsewhere.
To counter this, the district ought to bet-
ter integrate its schools so that the segrega-
tion among neighborhoods does not manifest
in their children’s education. As it stands,
two schools — Pittsburgh University Prep
6-12 and Westinghouse Academy 6-12 —

° serve black populations of 95 percent and
. 97 percent, respectively.

The responsibility of extending educa-
tional opportunities does not end, however,

tions of higher education, credited for the re-
gion’s recent success, ought to become more
accessible to all residents of the city, who have
allowed them to thrive. Universities such
as Pitt and Carnegie Mellon ought to ﬁmd
partnerships with schools in neighboring
communities '— such as the Hill District —
that would beneﬁt most from SAT practice
sessions, undergraduate tutors and ﬁnancial
aid information sessions, which the univer-

sities are particularly qualiﬁed to provide.

By ﬁmding these sustainable partner-
ships, an education at Pitt and a role in
Pittsburgh’s Renaissance wouldn’t seem so
distant to the children who walk to school
in the shadow of the Cathedral of Learning.

Winter Wedding Party fuses sounds of 3 nations on debut album

Emma Kilcup
Staff Writer

Hallie Pritts entered the Pittsburgh music
scene 10 years ago when she moved to the
city from nearby Scottdale, Pa., and created
the alt-country Americana band Boca Chica,
the fulﬁllment of a dream conceived in her
college days. This year, she pursued another
dream, one thatbegan 12 years ago when she_
met a young D] named Jules Etienne while
studying abroad in Marburg, Germany. The
immediate music bond from their six shared
months developed into a prolonged dialogue
of intermittent emails about projects and
ideas that lasted 10 years. On Oct. 11, the
two released their ﬁrst collaborative project,
Winter Wedding Party.
The band’s self—titled album is a product

of perseverance and spontaneity. Pritts and
Etienne had discussed collaborating during
their back-and—forth sharing of music and

ideas. But Pritts had settled in, Pittsburgh .

and was busy with Boca Chicawhile Etienne

was working on projects andmaking a life .

in Berlin. When Boca Chica went_on a break,
Pritts realized that she could carve enough

time into her schedule to make itto Europe.) ' '

From there, the whirlwind projectbegan.
“I emailed [Etienne], ‘Maybe we should
make that record now?’ and he was like,
‘Yeah, sure, you have to come now, I’m having
a baby,”’ Pritts said.
- Pritts spent 30 days preparing, holed
up in her Pittsburgh apartment scribbling

songs, before ﬂying to Berlin for a 10-day _

intensive recording session that produced
nine songs. During her month-long writing

session, Pritts  Etienne sharedideas via

lemail.for. what their album could become,

many, of which included a lot of Marie La-
foret inspiration. Then this January, Pritts

. joined Etienne and his wife in their apart-
, rnentetumed—recording'studio inwedding,

a borough in Berlin. She spent her mornings

.,. exploring the city while Etienne was at work,
playing tourist before playing music into the F

late hours of the night. 4

‘For Pritts, Winter Wedding Party was a
departure from all she was used to working
with in America: plenty of time to write and
record, a full band of musicians and almost
entirely Americana folksy country music.
When she arrived in Germany, she entered
Etienne’s world of music, an apartment full
of keyboards and synthesizers. After laying
down a rhythm track, they could add layers

— something Pritts had never done before.

“We’d record aerhythm track and play
around with sound,” Pritts said. “We’d have
something down, listen to it and I’d be like,
‘Can you make me sound more like a robot‘?”’

The layered beats and synthetic additions
ﬁt the multifarious nature of the project and
give the album a character ﬁttingly difficult
to categorize in one word. The ‘disparate
elements, American folk and French elec-
tronic music, create” an equally chill and
upbeat sound. Neither Pritts nor Etienne
could choose one genre. or word to describe
the album: folk—electric, French pop, lo—ﬁ
lite rock.

“When we met, I had no idea what would
come out,” Etienne said. “It sounds like

hiccup’, and fans are left unsatisﬁed.

That’s exactly where B-Room leaves
us.

The eighth album by Dr. Dog, B-Room
isn’t anything special. The band’s genre-
bending, folksy, somewhat-psychedel-
ic, occasionally lo—ﬁ sound has been

around for more than a decade, so lis— ’

otown’ aesthetic didn’t pan out. Photo-courtesy

— teners accustomed to its music will note

that the biggest innovation on B-Room
might be its lack thereof. The album is
a stripped—down and simplistic 12—song
stretch that sees Dr. Dog trading in some
of its post-production sounds for a more
Motown—type feel, but not even that is
enough for the album to really pop or

stand out in some sort of oddly notice-
able way, as the band’s older albums did.

While many of Dr. Dog’s albums do
sound similar, the better ones stand
apart from one another by having some
sort of distinction. That being said, the
biggest problem with B-Room might be
that it’s not enough like Be the Void or
one of the band’s other stronger albums.

The album does have a couple of
tracks that are keepers. “Phenomenon”
has a steel-string feeling to it that mixes
a nice amount of reverberation with
lead vocalist Scott McMicken’s voice.
And asthe .banjo~riffs:getva little fancy

toward thechorus, the instrument’s

delicate pluckings are complemented

by percussion to give certain parts of’

the song an umph that makes it seem
like a quick—paced foot-tapper.

The album’s third song, “Minding
the Usher,” is one of the best on the
album, as it’s whiny in all the right Dr.

Matt Schaub, Kanye and aparazzi ‘zoo—anima1’ treatment

Shawn Cooke
Staff Writer

Two weeks ago, rapper Kanye West sat
down with BBC’s Zane Lowe for a pas-
sionate interview that covered a broad
spectrum of topics including se1f—es-
teem, innovation and his admiration for
“dopeness.” Soon after, jimmy Kimmel
aired a sketch on his show “jimmy Kim-
mel Live!” reenacting West’s rousing
interview — albeit with child actors
spewing profanities.

West took to Twitter to condemn
not only Kimmel’s spoof, but also the
actions of paparazzi.

“Jimmy Kimmel, I don’t take it as a
joke.  You don’t have scum bags hop-
ping over fences trying to take pictures
of your daughter. ...Jimmy Kimmel put
yourself in my shoes,” West quipped in
caps—locked fury, before firing an un-
printable insult about Kimmel’s sex life.

Meanwhile, another widely-scruti-
nized pubic figure faced similar “fence-

 

hopping” treatment. Houston Texans
quarterback Matt Schaub has recently
been facing harsh criticism from fans.
After a disastrous start to the 2013 sea-
son, initial reports surfaced that Schaub
was verbally accosted by fans outside

Trespassers on Matt Schauh’s property drew widespread sympathy. MCT Capu

of his home. He later denied these re-
ports, but he confirmed that people

V were spotted taking pictures outside of

his house. The Schaub family has also
ﬁled a report with the Houston Police
Department regarding trespassers.

 

Although the behavior of these dis-
gruntled Texans fans cannot be con-
doned, the incident poses a striking
parallel to West and the paparazzi.
When a low-key NFL quarterback and
his family fall victim to the same ag-
gressive tactics as those the paparazzi
take with West, the press takes notice.
The blurred lines between celebrity
and atlflete (or even celebrity and de-
ity) would fill a whole other piece. But

- even if an athlete or musician enjoys

such lofty status, does that mean they

‘should be subjected to this “zoo-ani-

mal” treatment?

West hammered that term home in
his interview with Kimmel last Wednes-
day night as they discussed the lack of
human decency in paparazzi culture.
When West assaulted a paparazzo back
in july, many were quick to condemn
his actions. After baring his soul on
Kimmel, however, West just seemed like

any other 36-year-old parent struggling
to balance his staunch personal and
professional demands.

Early in the interview, Kimmel clari-
fied that the Twitter clash was not a
publicity stunt for either of them,
prompting West’s assertion that he
has “never done a publicity stunt” in
his life. Whether or not his intention
is to draw attention from the media,

West simply has no choice in the matter: .

Anything he says andevery punch he
throws will be scrutinized by the wid-
est possible audience. After watching
the Kimmel interview, it’s obvious that
this scrutiny has taken its-toll on West.

It’s easy to feel sympathetic for
Schaub, an NFL nice guy who has largely
avoided the media spotlight and allure
of endorsement deals. But why does
West receive no such sympathy? Is it
because of his polarizing statements,
his reality—star girlfriend or his per-
ceived braggadocio? Maybe. But I’m
not convinced that this story would

MOT Campus
change if you stripped away all of West’s
idiosyncrasies and replaced him with
a slightly more wholesome celebrity.
In the eyes of many armchair critics,
being heckled and constantly trailed by

the paparazzi fallsright under the ce-
lebrity job description — as if it’s some-
thing they’ve signed up for. As much as
celebrities such as West have to keep
a high profile to maintain relevance,
dealing with “scum bags hopping over
fences trying to take pictures of your
daughter” isn’t part of the contract.

The paparazzi have been a ﬁxture in
popular culture for decades now, trail-
ing celebrities and their families from
the moment they leave the house -— if
they’re deemed importantenough. In
the ’90s and early 2000s, images and
videos captured might grace magazine
covers or entertainment news shows,
which seems tame compared to the
tools modern paparazzi have at their
disposal.

In our modern YouTube culture,
footage of celebrities is easier to ac-

. cess than ever before, prompting a

race for entertainment reporters to
post the mostjarring or shocking ma-

_ terial before anyonepelse. Fueled by our

obsession with celebrities, this inva-
sive behavior is accepted as the "status
quo, without any consideration for the
damaging impact it might have on the

subjects.

Some recent vigilante flicks have
glamorized the father who snaps to
protect his family at all costs. Though
West certainly hasn’t been faced with
Liam Neeson levels of danger, he ap-
pears to have had his “Taken” moment
and reached his breaking point — in
spectacularly viral fashion. Punching
a reporter is difficult to justify, but is
it any less humane than the tactics that
provoked it?

Although they lead very different
public lives, Schaub and West ultimately
want the same thing: safety and respect
for their families. It might be a stretch
to dub West a family man at this point,
but he seems to.aim for the distinction.
If that characterization never comes,
however, he’ll just have to settle for
creative genius. I

Beach House. We used normal instruments
and it became more modern during the pro-
cess of recording.” _ .
Pritts’ sunny, feminine voice carries the mel-
ody of each song, while Etienne’s electronic
additions give them depth. The result is a
twangy sound that offers enough elements
to stray from the pigeonholing of genres.
Difficult to categorize but easy on the ears,
it is a successful mix of sound. .
Since their months in Germany as teen-

agers, Etienne had always exposed Pritts to .

the new and different. Working as a DJ,
Etienne would bring Pritts along when
he was able to book a club or whenhe
did his radio show.

“He is the'person who introduced
me to indie music  or I should say
hip, cool, underground music,” Pritts
said. “We were listening to Sigur Ros’s
first album. I had never heard anything
like it.” ' . .

During this time, Etiénne helped
Pritts discover artists such as Goldfrapp
and Cat Power, whose voice is reminis-

cent of Pritts’ own. But Etienne was also '

drawn to folk artists such as Bonnie

‘ “Prince” Billy and Bob Dylan, whereas

Pritts was a fan of Serge Gainsbourg
and all—female French groups from the
1960s. The album is a derivative of this

composite inspiration. It is the product.

of two people from different places with
different tastes and perspectives.

On the album, there is a cover of the
playful “Tu Veux ou Tu Veux Pas,” origi-

nally sung in» the 1960s by French singer
Brigitte°Bardot. Other tracks, such as
“Lying on.the Grass,” slide from slow-
er, drawn-out synth sounds to lighter,
sweet vocals. , .
There is even a track, “Your Heart
has Teeth,” that represents the genre

of Italo—disco._ Etienne’s longtime friend '
and musical partner Jules Valeron

played the keys for this particular song,
which also included synthesizers,‘ or-
gans and hand claps.

“We didn’t take years to conceptual-

izeit. We just got together and had fun,” ’

Etienne said. »
Pritts prefers the more organic meth-

-od of making music, as well. It is what

has allowed her to release this more
pop-electronic album despite years
devoted to Americana—folk music. She
does not alter the way she writes music
depending on genre —— the difference
depends on who she has surrounding
her. Etienne’s and Pritts’ shared open-
ness and eagerness to experiment are
what guest artist Valeron attributes to
how well the two work together.
“[E_tienne] can connect to other peo-
ple very fast and understand the direc-
tion they want to go,” Valeron said. “On
the other hand, he puts his own touch,

_ tries something new, something fresh.”

Etienne and Valeron became music
mates in 2006. Since then, they have
continuously collaborated on each oth-
er’s projects and jammed ov.er beers._

does that say for B-Room as a whole?

It says that it’s boring, and that it’s
like most other Dr. Dog albums minus
any semblance of a wow factor. But di-
agnosing the cause of that may be easier
said than done, with the only real evi-
dence pointing to the eponymous B-
room in which the album was recorded.

The band members took it upon
themselves to renovate a former silver-
smith mill on the outskirts of western
Philadelphia into a recording studio,
choosing to trade in their former studio
for a bare-bones setting, and apparently
the minimalist atmosphere crept its way
into the music. '

As previously mentioned, Dr. Dog was
shooting for a Motown—esque soul sound
on this album, and the reliance on vocals
to achieve that may be why so much of
the composition falls ﬂat — a very big
problem for a band whose interesting
sound is contingent on fascinating in-
strumentals.

Compounding that problem is the
trouble McMicken seems to have had
transitioning his voice from having soul
to being soulful. So many of Dr. Dog’s
songs are home to impassioned pleas,
warbling lullabies and soft—spoken,
hushed tones. No one can accuse the
band’s Vocals and lyrics of sounding
insincere. But there is a clear divide
between the songs having a sound of
conviction and them sounding like soul
music, and the tracks on B-Room fall
short of that measurement.

The idea offalling short really seems

In the 83rd minute, the Orange nearly

corner of the net. But Lynd made a diving
save to keep Syracuse off the board.

Just six minutes later, the Orange al-

Pitt football has yet to complete the ﬁrst
‘half of its season, but the concerns about
the team have taken a 180-degree turn in
just ﬁve games. .

After a 41-13 loss to the .nation’s cur-
rent No. 5 ranked team, Florida State, the
Panthers’ offense scored 10_7 points and
racked up 1,125 yards in victories against
New Mexico and Duke. But the defense al-
lowed Pitt’s opposition to score 82 points
and post‘802 yards. -

Now, the script has been ﬂipped. The
Pitt defense allowed a total of 22 points
and 503 yards in its last two games,‘while
the offense has declined, scoring just 23
points over 409 yards of offense during
the same stretch of games. _

I The latest episode came in a 19-9 loss

Jason Hendricks and the res of Pitt’s defense played well against Virginia Tech, but got b

to the No. 24 Virginia Tech Hokies (6-1,
3-0 ACC) Saturday in Blacksburg, Va., dur-
ing which the Panthers (3-2, 2-2) offense
never found a rhythm, while the defense
limited the Hokie offense to 315. yards

of total offense. Head coach Paul Chryst .
» summed up the loss as clearly represent-

ing the dichotomy developed in Pitt’s play
in the team’s two recent games.

“Defensively, I felt we did some re-
ally good things,” Chryst said. “We really
didn’t do anything in the ﬁrst half, so you
couldn’t give yourself a chance to really
get the running game going.”

Pitt’s running game contributed just
23 total yards, all of which were negated
by the eight sacks for a loss of 49 yards
registered by the Hokies at the expense
of quarterback Tom Savage and Pitt’s of-
fensive line.

most recent game. ,

“They were pinning back their ears,”
Chryst said. “Protection was an issue,
clearly something two weeks in a row now.
We’ve got to clean that up.”

Defensive end Dadi Nicolas took ad-

just one minute to play in the match, Sta-
moulacatos again hit the post with a shot.
No other offensive chances came about
for either side, and Pitt escaped with one
NCAA point and a scoreless tie.

The Panthers’ lone shot of the match
missed the net. Syracuse goalie Alex Bono
recorded his 16th career shutout and did
not record a save in the match.

The result is important because the
team continues to eye one of the eight
ACC tournament spots. Currently, the
Panthers are just ﬁve points behind the

‘ Orange for the tournament’s No. 8 seed

with three conference matches remain-
ing.

Women’s soccer at Florida State: 4-0

The Panthers (4~9-1, 0-9 ACC) fell to
the N o. 3 Florida State Seminoles (12-0-3,
7-0-2 ACC) 4-0 Sunday afternoon on the
road. The Seminoles scored three goals
in 13 minutes to hand the Panthers their
ninth ACC loss.

The match was the fourth time in six
matches that Pitt played a top-10 oppo-
nent, and it wasthe second consecutive
match in Florida.

Pitt stayed close to the highly—ranked
Seminoles early in the game. The team
did not allow a goal until the 40th min-

ute, when Anna McClung found the back
of the Pitt net off a beautiful pass from
Yulie Lopez. .

Despite allowing 15 shots and four
corner kicks, the Panthers were able to
hold the Seminoles to just one goal over
the ﬁrst 45 minutes of the match. 4

Following halftime, the Seminoles
broke through on a pair of goals just two
minutes apart. The ﬁrst goal was scored
by Dagny Brynjarsdottir-off a cross from
Megan Campbell.

‘ The second goal was scored by Marta
Bakowska-Mathews off a penalty kick.

Following the third goal, the Pan-
thers settled down until they allowed the
Seminoles to score their fourth goal with
just over two minutes left in the match.
The strike gave Florida State a four—goal
margin that held through the end of the
match.

The Panthers are off until they face
their ﬁfth top-10 opponent in six games,
when they welcome Virginia Tech to Am-
brose Urbanic Field on Sunday for Se-
nior Day. As part of the festivities, the
Panthers will honor Dana DelleFemine,
Caroline Keefer, Katie Lippert, Alyssa
Meier and Morgan Sharick in the last
home game of their Pitt careers. ﬂ

Men’s soccer continues
search for ﬁrst Win of season
against William and Mary

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt men’s soccer returns to Ambrose
Urbanic Field Tuesday night for a break
in conference play against the Tribe of
William and Mary. The Panthers (0-6-
4, 0-5-2 ACC) look for their first win of
the regular season following back—to-

V backties. '

Pitt’s two recent match results in-
spired a stint of conﬁdence in the team,
as the Panthers tied both Virginia Tech
last Tuesday and Syracuse on Saturday.
Each draw was led by goalkeeper Dan
Lynd’s efforts, and both matches ended
without either side scoring a goal.

Lynd leads the ACC in conference play
with 32 saves, averaging 6.4 per game,
but the Panthers’ keeper ranks seventh
in save percentage at 74.4 percent.

Overall this season, Lynd has started
every game for the Panthers and the op-
position has scored just 1.43 goals per
game against him. Lynd’s total save per-
centage registers at 79.5 percent, and
Lynd has recorded 58 total saves.

But like the Panthers’ season thus far,
Lynd’s efforts just haven’t been enough.

‘Lynd’s record of 0-6-4 reﬂects the team’s

total record in 2013 that is yet to see the
team win a game.
Winless 2013 may carry through

Tuesday’s game, as the Tribe enters the
match as winners of four of their past
ﬁve contests. Out of the Colonial Athletic
Association, William and Mary (5-3-1,
1-1 CAA) boasted what was possibly the
upset win of the year when it defeated
No. 1 North Carolina Sept. 24, 1-0. '

William and Mary’s win gave the Tar
Heels their first loss of the season and
was spurred by a goal fromjackson Eskay
in the 73rd minute. .

Eskay is tied for the team’s lead in
both points and goals with three scores
and nine total points. Chris Albiston is
tied with Eskay for the team’s leading

. points by virtue of his team-high ﬁve

assists.

Four of the Tribe’s players own mul-
tiple goals this season, with three scored
by Eskay andjosh West and two belong-
ing to Albiston and Chris Perez.

4 William and Mary’s offense averages
only 1.33 goals per game over its nine
games this season, and the Tribe relies
primarily on a staunch defense. Thus far,
William and Mary has allowed its opposi-
tion to score seven total goals — good
for a goals against average of just 0.78.

A large part of the Tribe’s defensive

effort comes from its physical play on

their side of the pitch. This season, Wil-

times when you’ve gotta get the ball out
of [Savage’s] hand.”

Alongside the eight sacks, Savage also '

_ sustained seven hits on plays in which he
wasn’t sacked. A large part of the Hokies’
success on the line of scrimmage came
from quality play in the secondary.

“I thought their corners going in were
pretty good and sometimes it takesla little
bit longer, you’re kind of waiting for that

space,” Chryst said.” _

As a result, the Hokies could send more
men on blitzes while leaving sometimes
only four or ﬁve players down the ﬁeld to

‘ cover the likes of Devin Street and Tyler

Boyd. Virginia Tech’s work in the second-

ary was arguably the best yet against two

candidates for the Biletnikoff Award.
Street’s numbers were still of quality,

with ﬁve receptions for 104 yards —— the

largest portion of which came on a 48-
yard prayer he caught from Savage near
the end of the first half to set up a ﬁeld goal
for Chris Blewitt from 47 yards out with
14 seconds remaining before halftime. .

- this season, managing to record just two

receptions for 20 yards. Virginia Tech’s
performance against the duo made the
Hokies the ﬁrst team to keep Boyd or
Street out of the end zone this season.

“I think we’ve got to look at it not just
with the O—line, but with the quarter-
backs, the routes we’re running,” Chryst
said. “Everyone can own that a little bit,
I think.”

On the bright side, Pitt’s defense
turned in another solid performance to
follow up the Virginia game. Pitt allowed

only 188 yards and three points to the -

avaliers.

Multiple times Saturday, the Hokies
embarked on long drives only to fall short
of touchdowns inside or close to the red
zone. Virginia Tech was forced to kick
ﬁve ﬁeld goals, on which Cody Journell
converted four of ﬁve to keep Pitt within

striking distance for much of the game.

But there were also times the Panthers
had opportunities to halt Hokies drives
before they could start rolling and failed
to do so. Virginia Tech converted eight
of 20'third-downattempts, a number of

‘which were on big plays.

“Virginia Tech made some big plays,
kept some drives alive,” Chryst said.

Defensive tackle Aaron Donald and
linebacker Todd Thomas were standouts
for the Panthers Saturday. Donald record-
ed six tackles and two sacks to become the

‘ nation’s active career_—leader in sacks at
26.5, while Thomas recorded a game-high
12 tackles and 1.5 tackles for loss.

In Thomas’ eyes, the extra weekto

' ‘ prepare for Virginia Tech helped the Pan-

thers’ performance defensively.

“Everybody buckled down and hit the
playbook, watched overtime on ﬁlm,”
Thomas said. “Everybody just did what
they had to do today.”

But theloss negated much of any good
feelings following the game, leaving the
atmosphere in the locker room slightly
darker than usual.

g “It’s a little clown,” Donald said. ‘‘We’ve
, got to build off this game and learn from
our mistakes.” 1

liam and Mary has committed 103 fouls’
(more than 10 per game) against 78 total
committed by its opposition. 1 '

That defensive effort will make life

' difficult for a Pitt team that hasn’t scored
a goal since Oct. 1 against Xavier in a
2-1 loss. Since, the Panthers have been
shut out by Virginia, Virginia Tech and
Syracuse.

The challenge to score only gets
tougher against Tribe goaltender Mac
Phillips. Phillips has allowed just seven
goals this season and 82.1 percent of the
shots placed on his pipes.

Meanwhile, the Panthers enter the
match with an average of only 0.40 goals
per game over 30 shots on goal this sea-
son. Phillips has saved 32 total shots this
season. I
