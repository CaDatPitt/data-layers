Tower B ﬂood soaks eleven dormitory rooms

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Sta_[)"W1‘iter

After being without a water supply for
approximately ﬁve hours, women residents
on the 16th ﬂoor of Tower B got their
water back. But they were literally “left
out to dry” after a ﬂood soaked 11 of the

‘ 20 rooms on the ﬂoor.

“It was like [the movie] The Blob. The
water just kept seeping out of the bathroom
and into all of our rooms,” said Jaime
Krupnick, a resident on that ﬂoor.
According to the residents, the water supply
on the 16th ﬂoor went dry at around 4;30
pm. on Saturday. The women were
without water until approximately 8 p.m.

When one of the residents attempted to

use a sink at around 8 p.m., she called to
the other women that the water was
working again. Almost immediately
afterward, at least two of the toilets began
to quickly fill up and overﬂow.

“It was pouring out [of the toilets] pretty
quickly,” said resident Lisa Raff. “It was
like a river. The water just kept on coming
out at us.”

Since most rooms are carpeted, residents
tried using towels to soak up the water
that was drenching the rugs. When that
failed, the women took down the curtains
from closets and used those to soak up
some of the water.

“The curtains on our closet doors were
much heavier [than the towelsl, so we
thought that they would be better than the

towels. We had to do something,” said
Stephanie Zweig, another resident on the
floor.

Raff placed a call to the Towers main
desk around 8:15 p.m. to see if any help
was available. A desk attendant there told
Raff that there was nothing the Towers
desk could do except send someone from
housekeeping to the floor.

“[The Towers desk] said that someone
from housekeeping would be there in five
minutes with extra towels for us,” said
Raff. “No one ever showed up.”

Approximately 45 minutes later, after

many more calls from residents to the
Towers desk, three maintenance men
arrived with water vacuums to begin
soaking up some of the ‘water.

Unfortunately, most of the damage had
already been done.

“Before they came into my room, one of
the [maintenance workers] stuck his hand
underneath one of the doors to see how
much water was in the room,” said
Krupnick. “The water completely covered
his hand,” she added. ' ‘

“I had towels folded and stacked in a
milk crate on the floor of my room,” said
Zweig. “The first two from the bottom‘
were completely soaked.” A

The maintenance workers at the scene
opened the rooms of girls who were not
there with a master key.

Although most rooms were affected by
the ﬂood, those rooms closest to the

SGB demands evaluation book

By Stacie Spanos
For The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
wants course selection to be more
than a trial-and-error process for
students.

“I hate taking classes and getting
stuck with a professor that sucks.
And usually what ends up
happening is that you don’t get a
good grade in the course because
you don’t like it but you do have
to stay in it,” said SGB member
Bob Batchelor.

Batchelor and SGB member
Pat Abramowich have submitted
a proposal 5 to have student
evaluations of professors
compiled in a book so that
students, can use the results of the
evaluations to choose their
teachers.

The proposal begins with the
reinstatement of the SGB
academic—affairs committee,
which was disbanded in 1985.
The sole purpose of this
committee would be to gather
results of teacher evaluations and
compile the information into a
book.

Sexistlyrics target of censorship debate

Sexist stereotypes in music was the focus of a Seeburger
panel discussion sponsored by the Pitt women’s
studies department as part of the Celebrate

Diversity ‘festival.

Currently, course evaluations
are distributed by the Office of
Measurement and Evaluation of
Teaching, but the results are not
published. This committee would
be asked to develop an additional
evaluation form to be handedout
to students at the same time as the
university's computerized form.
The form would ask the student
to rate the" course and the
instructor on a scale between one
and 10. The student could also
make comments about grading,
required readings and other
aspects of the course. Copies of
the book would be placed in
strategic locations throughout the
campus.

But according to Debbie Hazlett
of the OMET, the SGB proposal is
flawed. Hazlett said that having
more than one evaluation form
would cause “burnout” in the
most students, since they only
have a limited amount of time to

. fill out the form.

Batchelor and Abramowich’s
idea is not new. During the 1970s
and early '80s the academic-
affairs committee published a
book titled the Undergraduate

Academic Review (later called the
Review of Course Evaluations)
from the results received from
OMET. The publication was
terminated in 1985 due to several
reasons, including a lack of
participation by faculty members.

Batchelor and Abramowich’s
proposal is based on a new policy
which requires that all
departments have courses
evaluated by students. Batchelor
and Abramowich want to make
teacher evaluation publications
mandatory for all faculty.

The format of this new book
would be quite different from
those used in the past. It would

include an overall rating of the ,

instructor and course as well as a
brief paragraph containing
pertinent information about the
Course. This information would
include comments about with the
instructor, the readings and other
aspects of the course.

This new format was inspired
by a University of Virginia course-
evaluation book which Batchelor
thinks is far superior to Pitt’s old
evaluation book.

Unemployed receive training at Job Links

By William Graves
For T be Pitt News

Posted in the window of a small store on
Atwood Street is a cardboard sign with “Job
Links” written on it in pencil.

The sign is relatively unobtrusive, but
according to Erika Quiroz, a full-time Job
Links trainer, the organization’s 75-percent
placement rate draws attention.

Job Links is a non—profit organization
operated by Breachmenders, Inc. and the

Oakland Planning and Development
Organization.

Quiroz stated Job Links’s goal: “ltol help
the unemployed get jobs and the employed
get better jobs.”

According to Quiroz, Job Links receives

_lists of available jobs from the University of

Pittsburgh and Oakland’s merchants and
hospitals.

Although Job Links does find employment
for people, the three—week “job readiness
and attitudinal training” course which Quiroz

and Jo Ann Fountain, also a trainer, teach is
even more important, according to Quiroz.
For many, this class “helps people to recognize
their problem areas," said Quiroz.

Quiroz and Fountain said that these
problems can range from being unable to
write a resume to having little or no knowledge
of “work-world requirements.”

Quiroz said, “Some people come in and
want a job within 48 hours. You have to make
these people understand that they may have

Activists tour the country to legalize hemp marijuana

By Karen D. Speece
Staff Writer

The greenhouse effect and
several diseases can be eliminated
or reduced by legalizing cannabis
hemp marijuana, according to
Shan Clark and Jack Herrer,
spokespersons for Hemp Tour
,90_

“The medical record on
cannabis hemp is quite clear. It’s
absolutely non-toxic; no one’s
ever died from it; there’s never
been an [overdose]. It’s
considered the safest

therapeutically active substance’

known. It’s good for asthma,
emphysema, bronchitis, nausea
and glaucoma, and for these uses
it’s absolutely illegal,” Clark said.

Clark and approximately 20
other people were in Pittsburgh
on Saturday as part of a tour
across the United States to
promote the use of hemp.

“The number one cash crop in

Before 1969, the United States,

Herrer said that many of the
perceptions people have about
hemp are false.

“The Partnership for a Drug

see our planet die than our
children get high.’ Boy, that’s
tough love. I don’t want no parent

continued.

“People say, ‘What

said. ’

Dana Beal, a full-time hemp
legalization activist,
hemp is totally safe.

“It’s safer than chewing bubble
gum. Gum has dyes in it.
Marijuana has nothing bad in it,”
Beal said.

“What kind of a message does
that send? You can send our kids
to Saudi Arabia [to] get gassed,
but you’re afraid they might
smoke some harmless ﬂowers
here?”

Beal said methanol fuel, a gas
substitute, can be made from
hemp. “We can manufacture
methanol for

“Mr. and Mrs. Drug Free

For commuters and local
residents, parking has been an
ongoing problem in the
Oakland area.

The garage at the Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall is
still under construction. The
latest effort to improve the
parking situation is the
renovation of Schenley Plaza.

Construction began Aug. 5
as part of a project to convert
the meter parking lot on Forbes
Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard into an attendant
lot. Completion of the two-
phase project is expected by
December 1990.

Currently only 65 of the lot’s
200 spaces have been available
for parking during the first
phase of construction. Since
construction began later than
expected, contractors are now
considering closing all parking
in the present lot, so the
renovation may be completed
sooner by taking advantage of

Late Construction date
justz'fz'czbZe, 0ﬁ’z'cz'ozZs say

the nice weather. However,
deputy director of parking
authority Richard Zimmer
thinks that a portion of the lot
should remain open.

“It’s better to lose a little time
on construction and save
spaces,” he said.

No official complaints have
been filed in the city
concerning the parking, or lack
of parking, in Oakland. On-
site representative for the
Parking Authority, john
Suskewicz Jr., said, “A traffic-
control plan is in effect and
updated as needed.”

He added, “Traffic during
rush hour is bad, but from 7:30
am. to 5:30 p.m., traffic is
constantly heavy.

Zimmer defended the late
date for construction: “There
is no slow time in the area. We
wanted to get [the lot] done.”

Zimmer does not think there
has been an inconvenience to
students because “construction
began before school, so
[students] get the picture now.”

Local interest in peace corps rising

By Howard Goodman
For T be Pitt News

Wanted: Men and women with
either a f our—year college diploma
or five years of experience in a
skilled trade.

This describes the typical
student who joins the Peace
Corps, according to Virginia
Mosley, the public affairs director
of the national Peace Corps phone
line.

However, all types of people
choose to serve in the Peace
Corps, Mosley said. Each person
has his or her own reason to
enlist, she added.

According to Mosley, some
volunteers wish to experience
life overseas, especially if they
previously have been exposed
to foreign countries. Others join
for more altruistic reasons, such
as educating the less fortunate.
Self-motivated individuals who
wish to expand their skills and
horizons often enlist.

Age and experience vary
among the 60 different programs
that comprise the Peace Corps.
There is no age limit for joining
the Peace Corps, and 10 percent
of all present volunteers are over
the age of 50, said Mosley.

The number of applications to
the Peace Corps projects is
increasing. According to Peace
Corps volunteer Whitney
Finnstrom, local membership has
increased steadily every year for
the past five years. Membership
has also increased nationally, she
added.

Future Peace Corps projects
are always on the horizon. New
opportunities and experiences are
available worldwide, including
the new Eastern European
frontier.

“Unparalleled numbers of
applications have been filed in
the past year,” Mosley said. “We
are expanding like mad."

The first groups leaving for
Poland and Hungary departed
earlier this month, according to
Mosley, and applications for
assistance have been ﬁled from
several other countries in the
area.

Other new programs on the
agenda include sending
volunteers to African countries
such as Namibia and the Congo.
Further assistance to Laos is also
scheduled, she said.

Tentative plans are also being
considered for the Peace Corps
to return to South and Central

American countries such as Chile
and Nicaragua, according to
Mosley.

Finnstrom stated that anti-
American sentiment is growing
worldwide, and volunteers are
becoming aware of the potential
dangers.

On June 13, Peace Corps
volunteer Timothy Swanson and
hisjapanese aide were kidnapped
by guerrillas in the Philippines,
though they were released in
good condition after being treated
fairly well during the two to three
weeks of captivity.

Swanson is safely back home
in the United States. However
this incident, along with past
problems, has caused the Peace
Corps to pull outits 261 volunteers
from the Philippines.

The Peace Corps at Pitt has
temporarily suspended
operations because Shawn
Wright, the joint on—campus
recruiter for both Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon University, fulfilled his
contract and has gone to France
to pursue a career in international
law.

Mosley said that the Peace
Corps is actively seeking a
replacement for Wright.

Security
projects
top SGB
agenda

By Aimee Baldi and
Katherine Heatherington
For T be Pitt News

New projects topped the
agenda at the Student
Government Board meeting
on Wednesday, among them
campus safety, the elections
committee and the computer
labs.

The South Oakland shuttle,
which is operating on a trial
basis, is being publicized to
ensure its survival. SGB
President Julie Shepard
stated, “We really want to
see the South Oakland shuttle
continued. There are many
students who live in [South
Oakland] and can benefit
from this service."

The second SGB security
project involving the South
Oakland area is a
neighborhood block watch.
A joint venture with the South
Oakland Citizens Council, the
Pitt public safety department,
the Pittsburgh Police and the
Office of Student Affairs, its

purpose is to increase
communication and
awareness in the South

Oakland area. Since many
students change their
residences often, this is a
difficult operation, according
to the board.

The SGB is also concerned
about the elections
committee. Since the
resignation of the committee
chairperson, the judicial
committee and other board
members have been seeking
a qualified student to fill the

this situation will be resolved

damage.

“The [maintenance workers]
had no idea how bad the flood
was. They were in shock when
they arrived,” said Raff.

The residents were later told
that the rugs might be
shampooed. They were also told
that if they took damaged clothing
to the housekeeping office before
having the clothes cleaned, they
would be reimbursed for the cost
of the cleaning.

Spokespersons from both the
housekeeping and maintenance
departments could not be reached
for comment.

“I just want to know if [the
university] is going to do anything
at all to prevent something like
this from happening to us again,"
said Raff. A‘

Rally

Continued from page 1 ‘
Specter is targeted as one of the
six senators that are considered
swing votes concerning the
continuation of U.S. aid to El
Salvador. The Senate will vote
whether to withhold 50 percent
of aid to El Salvador.

Barney Dursler from the Mon
Valley Unemployed Committee
wanted people to know why the
protest was taking place.

‘‘[This is] to let corporate
America know that it can’t run

away,” he said. Dursler is
concerned about corporate
America's decision to invest in
other countries without raising

V the standard of living. Dursler

said that U.S. big business is
obligated to pay these workers a
fair wage and not reap huge
profits.

According to the Committee In
Solidarity with the People in El
Salvador, the U.S. is spending
$1.4 million a day for El Salvador.
“We are tired of lthisl,” said

Rhonda V Brownstein, the
spokesperson for the rally. “T his
is a war perpetrated by our own
government,” she said.

Many of the protestors were
concerned about the fairness of
the last elections in El Salvador.
“People voted for a right-wing
government because they were
scared [...l that the death squads
would increase. It’s happened in
the past,” said Brownstein.

Peter Shell, a member of
CISPIES, agrees with Brownstein:

“The elections were not fair}?
Shell feels that if the United
Nations would intervene in the
election process, the election
results would be a lot different.

Pitt Law Women’s Association
discussed sending medical aid to
El Salvador. “It’s all corrupt,
and nothing gets to the people,”
she said. Robinson mentioned
that when there was an
earthquake in the late '80s, a lot
of aid was not given to the people
of El Salvador.

Language type dictates teaching

By William Graves
For Tbe Pitt News

Students beginning a romantic

A language are being taught

differently than those taking a
Slavic language.

French, Italian, Spanish and
German instructors teach using
the “direct method.”

“The direct method emphasizes
communicative skills," said
Michael Schwartz, Ph.D. assistant
professor and coordinator of
French levels 1-4. According to
Schwartz, the ability to speak the
language in an everyday context
is the focus.

“Most students want to be able
to communicate,” he said.

According to Schwartz, in order
to do this, “The students mustuse
the language from day one.”
Because there is no easily
accessible French community in
Pittsburgh, “The classroom is the
only place to practice the

language,” said Schwartz.
Schwartz said that all classes

are taught entirely in the foreign
language; instructors are advised
not to speak any English from the
first day of classes.

Cathy Sendak—Sapp, a French
instructor for four semesters, said
that the students like using French
to communicate in class.
“Discussing hypothetical
situations and photographs [in
French} makes it easier to learn
vocabulary and grammatical
lessons,” said Sendak—Sapp.

The direct method is said to
work for the romantic languages,
but according to Oscar Swan,
chairperson of the Slavic
department, “Teaching Russian
requires a different methodology.”

Due to Russian’s complicated
forms of verb conjugation, the
“grammar translation” method is
used as well as the direct method.
This technique is used to help
students build a strong base in
Russian grammar, which is,
according to Swan, more difficult
than any romantic language.

“The direct method will very

quickly provide communicative
competence,” said Swan.

In reference to the grammar-
translation technique, Swan
added, “The complicated system
of grammar must be explained in
English in order to give students
a chance to advance in Russian.”

Swan explained that while
some students just want to “pick
up the language,” others want to
go further into Russian studies.

Swan said that he makes use of
both methods. “We segregate the
methods by using the direct in
recitation and the grammar
translation in the lectures,” said
Swan.

Undergraduate Russian
students have class ﬁve days a
week; they have three lecture
hours and two hours in recitation.
Lectures are taught by full faculty
members while recitations are
covered by teaching assistants.

Swan feels that introducing
important grammatical
groundwork should be in the
hands of faculty.

Segregation by cboice’
is one form 0 racism

By James Wechsler
Staﬂ" W1-iter

Pitt suffers from “segregation by choice," according to Albert
Ciafre, a resident director for the Office of Resident Life.

“Some members of ethnic and racial groups here separate
themselves from the student body by becoming too involved
with their own group, ” said Ciafre. He gave the Towers cafeteria
and the Greek system as prime examples.

“The units’ bonds are so strong that new members of different
groups are seen as unwelcome. This attitude is felt by prospective
members, and they are reluctant to join,” according to Ciafre.

Dave Hornyak, a resident director as well, opened a seminar
on racism held on Friday as part of Pitt’s Celebrate Diversity
Festival. The session began with a screening of “Racism 101,”
a video that highlights incidents of racial tension and conflict
on university campuses across the country. The subsequent
discussion focused on whether or not Pitt has escaped the
problem of racism.

“So far [Pitt has escapedl,” said Ciafre, who has seen the video
a number of times. He explained that there haven’t been any
incidents at Pitt similar in scale to those at Michigan University
or the University of Massachusetts, for example, and then
mentioned the segregation—by—choice problem.

_ Storyteller T emnjin shares lessons through his fol/elore

By Daniel Orr
For The Pitt News

Two brothers secretly brought
grain to the other’s barn to make
sure each had enough. The good
deeds canceled each other, but
the mutual love between the
brothers started a village between
the two barns.

Temujin, a world-famous
storyteller who appeared at Pitt
on Friday as part of the Celebrate
Diversity Festival, told this tale to
Pitt students on the Bigelow Patio
to express,”how good it is for
brothers to live and work
together.”

Temujin has been a professional
storyteller since 196%, traveling
all over the country to various
hotels and private parties to act
out folklore from different
cultures. Some of his stories are
modernized to hold the
audience’s interest.

“Otherwise, the stories would
go over their heads,” said Temujin.

On Friday, he combined
modernization with humor and
included visual and sound effects
to further entertain his listeners.
He actively involved the audience
in his performance, making jokes
with members of the crowd which

Evaluation boole needed...

University of Pittsburgh students currently can receive
information on any class they want to take. Unfortunately,
they can’t get any firsthand information about the instructors
of these courses.

Student Government Board members Bob Batchelor
and Pat Abramowich have proposed the creation of a
book containing teacher—evaluation results that could be
used by students to decide whether a certain instructor

, suits their needs.

Under current policy, instructors who wish to be
evaluated must fill out an evaluation-request form for the
Office of Measurement and Evaluation of Teaching. These
results are not published.

Batchelor and Abramowich propose that the SGB bring
back the academic—affairs committee, which was disbanded
in 1985. The job of this committee would be to gather
information for this book.

Before 1985, the university published a similar book
called the Undergraduate Academic Review This book,
which was discontinued in 1985 due to lack of faculty
participation among other things, published the results
given by OMET. '

The book, which would be published by the SGB,
would be based on a similar book compiled by the
University of Virginia.

Faculty members, under current policy, would have to
give their permission before anyone could publish the
results of their evaluations. The university should allow
the SGB to provide this information to the public so that

-students could be made aware of prospective professors’

weaknesses.

Debbie Hazlett, an evaluation specialist from OMET,
said that students would suffer from “burnout” if asked to
fill out extra evaluation forms for the SGB. However,
students would only be helping themselves by doing so.

Although the university evaluates its teachers, the fact
that it does not publish the results makes the procedure
of very little value for students. This policy does not help
students, who are on their own in their efforts to find
acceptable professors.

A book such as the one proposed by the SGB would
help raise university standards as well. It would force all
faculty members to perform their tasks efficiently, subject
to scrutiny by evaluation.

As Batchelor said, “I hate taking classes and getting
stuck with a [bad] professor. ” By making teacher evaluations
mandatory for all of its faculty members, Pitt would take
a step toward relieving its students of that burden.

Feminists should not apologize  

Last night I was talking to an acquaintance, and
the topic of feminism came up. She mentioned that
she attended a meeting of the Campus Women's
Organization and was pleasantly surprised with the
women thatshe had met there. I asked her why she
was so surprised, and she answered that she had
assumed that the women who attended these
meetings were “man haters,” and that all they
would probably do was complain about how awful
men were. But, she said, they weren't like that at
all; in fact, some of them even talked about their
boyfriends.

So, you found out that feminists are normal, just
like you, I said. And she kind of shrugged
sheepishly and said yeah, but...

...but what?

Like most of us, she had bought into the
stereotypical “man—hating” image of feminists‘. I
was glad that she had the courage and the interest
to attend the meeting. I am grateful that there are
women in this world who are intelligent and brave
enough to look at these stereotypes and challenge
them and their own perceptions,

us down. Phyllis Schlafly, the president of Eagle
Forum, a right-wing political lobbying group, was
largely responsible for the defeat of the Equal
Rights Amendment. In Michigan, a veto-proof
measure was passed which required girls 17 and
under to gain parental or judicial consent to have
an abortion. Barbara Listing, the president of Right
To Life of Michigan, said that the measure would
encourage teenagers to use birth control, and that
pregnant girls would be able (read forced) ‘to get
“help,” “support” and “guidance” from their families.
Don’t believe for a minute, though, that Right To
Life supports the teenage use of birth control. It is
these religiously motivated, pro-life groups that are
responsible for the fight against sex education and
birth-control information in the schools.

But it's not just on political issues that women
turn against women. ‘

Raunchy groups like 2 Live Crew cite women as
their biggest fans. In an issue of Rolling Stone
magazine, Luther Campbell talked about how

womenrush on the stage to dance and simulate .

sexual acts with the rapper. In

of what feminism is. But I am
angry, too, because most women
are content with the stereotypical
image of the bra burner. Where
did this image come from?

Lisa
Oshop

the same interview, one of 2 Live
Crew’s female dancers
complained that the stage scenes
are not explicit enough. A writer
for the Village Voice noted that

In my first women’s studies
class last semester, the students
prefaced any remarks that men might not approve
of with, “I am not a feminist, but...,” or “I am not a
bra burner, but....” Why are they apologizing for
criticizing a social order that has historically devalued
women as humans; in fact considered women as
having only a little more existential value than
cattle?

Because we are not allowed to criticize it, that’s
why. It's hard to say exactly who made the rules or
when. One theory is that with the advent of
organized religion came the rhetoric that women
should subjugate themselves to men, and that our
less—than-human status is justified because rewards
will come in the hereafter for those who suffer.
Religious leaders and slave owners told that story
to the slaves, too (and that the Bible says that it is
a sin to teach slaves to read). But that was over a
hundred years ago, and as thinking individuals we
don’t buy that anymore. Just like most people don’t
believe that women should sit separately from men
in church, so would nobody even think of telling
black people that their god would smite them if
they learned the ABCS.

I But how far have we really come?

After nearly two centuries of ﬁghting for equal
status with men, women are ﬁnding out that a lot
of the time it is women themselves who are holding

women seem to enjoy Andrew
Dice Clay’s humor as much as
men do. Why do we hate ourselves so much?

' Is it really about power? I think it is. If you are
an outspoken female and men don’t like it, all they
have to do is call us lesbians (or feminists), and
we’ll shut up. What straight woman wants to be
labeled a cultural taboo? Besides, whether they
think we are gay or not, our intelligence and our
senses of self may be too intimidating for them; in
other words, we might turn the guys off by being
too smart, and in this culture, what's a woman
without a man?

Women like Schlafly and Listing find that the way
to success in a man’s world is to hold down other
women. It is about power because when we
participate in our own abuse, at least it gives us a

‘sense of having some control over it.

Was this what Elizabeth Cady Stanton meant
when she fought for equal rights for women? Did
suffragettes think that in 1990 women’s equality
meant the right to vote, the occasional use of the
title Ms. and the right to be as insensitive and
power-mad as the system they fought?

I don’t think so, and as we become more aware
of these discrepancies, maybe more of us will
become brave enough to challenge what is right,
wrong or stereotypical.

Sooners trounce Panthers, 52-10, in Hackett’s first loss as coach

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

NORMAN, Okla. -— Well, it
had to happen sooner or later. It
happens to everyone, and for Pitt
Coach Paul Hackett, it just
happened Sooner.

The Panthers ﬁnally lost a game
under Hackett’s guide, but that is
the understatement _of the year.

“Is this an executioner’s chair?”
quipped Hackett as he took a
seat for post—game interviews
following the 14th—ranked
Oklahoma Sooners’ 52-10
spanking of the 13th—ranked
Panthers last Saturday.

“It was a rough day at the
office,” said Hackett. “They did a
hell of a job running their offense.
I give them all the credit in the
world.”

The temperature was 104
degrees on Owen Field, but after
its first play, the Sooner offense
started a snowball and kept rolling
it over the Panthers.

OU amassed 529 yards of total
offense, and the outcome was
more or less decided in the game’s
first two minutes.

‘‘I knew it was going to be a
long afternoon after the first play,
la 71-yard bomb from Sooner
quarterback Steve Collins to Z-

back Otis Taylorl,” said Hackett.
“We did some good things, both
on offense and defense, but we
never could get it quite together
—— we were just out of sync.

“I thought Curvin [Richards] had
a great game. I thought we threw
the ball well, [but] we just couldn’t
hook things up.”

Richards ran for 100 yards on
16 carries, his fourth consecutive
effort dating back to last season,
and his sixth in seven games.

Richards, however, was

upstaged by Taylor, his ex—LaPorte

High (Tex) teammate.

Many of the 71,117 crimson-
and—cream-clad Sooner fanatics
hadn’t even taken theirseats when
Taylor broke past Pitt cornerback
Marcus Washington for the game’s
opening score. ‘

The Panthers would never

recover.
“We just didn’t execute on
anything -— passes, catches,

everything,” said Pitt quarterback
Alex Van Pelt.

All season long Van Pelt has
said his goal for the Panthers is to
see the team playing in a'New
Year’s Day bowl game, and
despite the lopsided score, he
doesn’t feel this loss will be a
major setback even though the
loss may drop the Panthers out of

Steelers’ defensive eff s ri s

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

You knowlthat classic stadium chant “DEE—FENSE, DEE-FENSE!!!”?
Well, that was all Steeler fans had to cheer about last night in
Pittsburgh’s 20-9 victory over its division rival, the Houston Oilers.

Defense and special teams accounted for all the scoring, except for
two Gary Anderson field goals. Left cornerback Davidjohnson picked
off a Warren Moon pass in the first quarter and ran it back 21 yards
for a touchdown. Right corner Rod Woodson scampered 52 yards in
the fourth quarter for the first touchdown on a punt return of his
career.

“The defense really hung in there; they didn’t get too much help
from our offense,” Steeler head coach Chuck Noll said. “lThe defense}
was offensive too. They got the turnovers, got to the ball, and they
scored. It was a hard—fought, emotional ball game, and the defense
kept that intensity up. The offense did not.”

The defense started out on fire which was never quelled for the
entire 60 minutes. It stopped the Oilers on four straight possessions
in the first quarter while Bubby Brister and his offense were doing
next to nothing.

On Houston’s first drive, Moon’s pass was tipped by Ernest Givins
and picked up by Johnson for the score. Johnson was running and
juggling the ball for about seven yards before he finally gained
possession.

Meanwhile, Brister couldn’t put the ball into an open receiver’s
hands, and the offense stalled on every first-quarter possession. The
Steelers ran three plays and punted on three of their four drives, while
Brister missed a wide open Merril Hoge twice on third-down plays en
route to compiling -4 yards passing.

Speaking of passing, the much-discussed nin-and-shoot Houston
offense didn’t fare much better. Moon went 24-48 for 284 yards with
no TDs and four interceptions. With those numbers, it’s no wonder
every play seemed to be a pass call.

Ironically, the pass did not get the Oilers into the end zone,
however. In the second quarter, White took the ball into the end zone
on a left-end sweep, capping an eight play, 64-yard drive to tie the
score at seven all. On that same play, Steeler linebacker Greg Lloyd
was ejected for “expletives,” according to Noll and “unsportsmanlike
conduct” according to the referees, while protesting the TD call.

“Greg was jumping up and down and the referee came running in,

See Steelers, page 1 7

Curvin Richards (27) ran for 100 yards in Pitt's 52-10 loss at Okla.

the Top 20 polls today.
“You can still play in a big bowl
game with one loss. The important

thing now is for us to bounce
back,” said Van Pelt.
This weekend they’ll get that

 

opportunity at Syracuse. The
Orangemen are another option-
offense team, so the Panthers
will get another chance to practice
defending it.

And once the Syracuse coaches
see the film from this game, they’ll
probably try to run it even more.

But stopping the Oklahoma
offense was only one of Hackett’s
headaches. Another was jump-
starting his own offense.

Although Richards had his usual
100-yard game and Van Pelt threw
for a season-high 198 yards, it

was in reality their worst
performances of the young
season.

Van Pelt threw two inter-
ceptions, and Richards fumbled
twice -- all of which led to
Oklahoma touchdowns.

“I’m very concerned about the
fumbles [Van Pelt and fullback
Derrick Lewis also fumbledl,” said
Hackett. “We’re in trouble there.”

But despite the shellacking,
Hackett seemed, at times,
strangely upbeat after the game.

“When you’re building a
football team, you learn things.
Let’s find out how we respond to
a defeat,” said Hackett, “ I’ve said
all year long we have to bite off
each piece [of the season] one at
a time.”

Soccer team begins Big East season with win over ’Nova

By Doug Miller
Sta_[)“ Writer

The Pitt soccer team, playing
in what Coach Joe Luxbacher
called, “the best performance I’ve
seen [from] a Pitt soccer team in
quite a few years,” defeated the
Villanova Wildcats 2-0 this past
Saturday at Pitt Stadium..

The first half of the game was
played in an atypically Big East
fashion. Both teams resorted to
wide-open styles of play, which
probably had a lot to do with the
artiﬁcial playing surface.

It was the Panthers’ first look at
the turf this year, and they had
trouble early on with their longer
passes rolling off the crown of
the field and out of bounds.
However, Villanova also had
trouble keeping its quick
forwards onsides, as the Panther
defenders played a trapping—style
defense and frustrated Nova’s
forwards.

Pitt was the first team to go to
a shorter—style passing attack,
which changed the complexion
of the game and forced the
Villanova attackers into a
defensive mode.

Scott McCurry, a Pitt defender,
was the first to capitalize, as he
sprinted unmarked up the middle
of the field, taking a Mike Watson
drop pass and blasting home a
20-yard shot into the upper left-
hand corner of the goal with
19:54 left in the first half.

“I was wide open, and .Watson
turned and saw me. I just one-
touched it —— kind of a toe poke
— and I think I surprised their
goalkeeper,” McCurry said. For
the remainder of the half, the

Panthers bombarded the Wildcats’
goal, but most of the shots either
caromed off the goalposts or were
stopped by Mark Shumaker,
Villanova’s goalkeeper.

The second half started out on
a much more physical note,
forcing the referee to call a tighter
game.

The Panther squad dominated
play, winning the majority of loose
balls and keeping Villanova’s top
scorer, Ken Santos, in check. Nick
Liberati worked Santos over and
frustrated him, which evidently
prevented him from engaging in
his normal, free-wheeling style of
play.

“I tried to deny him everything.
He is a really good player, so I
had to watch him everywhere he
went. I tried to hit him hard a
couple times early on, just to let
him know I was there,” Liberati
said.

Huy Tran, Pitt’s most
accomplished scorer last year,
almost added to the Panthers’
lead early in the second half, but
his shot missed the corner of the
goal by inches.

But at the 52:24 mark of the
second frame, Pitt midfielder Ivan
Amayo took a pass from Tran and
buried a shot to the left side of

Shumaker. His goal moved the
Panthers’ record to 2-1 overall,
while .evening their Big East
record to 1-1.

Tim Sobelman, who played
the whole game in goal for the
Panthers, kept the Wildcats at
bay. Sobelman frustrated
Villanova attackers by
intercepting their passes on the
slick artificial turf, thus thwarting
their attempts at getting short
shots on goal.

“It felt really good to play the
whole game. Our entire team
really played well. We are gaining
a lot of confidence,” Sobelman
said.

Luxbacher agreed. “We played
a real, real solid game. Villanova

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

NORMAN, Okla. -
Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs
said his Sooner team was going
to pass the ball this year. And
they do —— on the first plays of
the game.

Last week against UCLA the
Sooners opened the game by
surprising a national-television
audience with a pass attempt.‘

Ditto this week — this time
with the Panthers as the
surprisees when Sooner
quarterback Steve Collins went
to Z—back Otis Taylor for a 71-
yard bomb.

That spark ignited what
seemed like one of those trick
explosives» for the Panthers.
They tried and tried but couldn’t
blow out the Sooners’ fuse.
Oklahoma detonated the
charge, winning 52-10.

It was the ‘ most points
surrendered by Pitt since a 55-

18 loss to Penn State in 1971.

But, c’mon. The Sooners
pass? It wasn’t for long. After
the opening strike the Sooners
proceeded to run the ball on
the next 19 plays from
scrimmage, compiling 151
yards and 21 points in the
process.

Why bother passing with that
kind of success?

The Sooners ended up with
450 rushing yards, the most
Pitt has yielded since 461 in a
56-7 Notre Dame loss, also in
’71.

Against the Sooners, the
Panther defense was about as
solid as a soggy soup cracker.

The Sooners finally forced
themselves to pass again after
being held to a third down and
10 from their own 4—yard line
in_ the second quarter. The
pass sailed out of bounds, and
the Sooners were forced to
punt

They also opened their next
possession with another
incomplete toss, again way

overthrown.

That out of the way, and the
critics silenced (who says they
don’t try to pass?), they went
back to the running game, their
bread and butter, and made
toast of the Panthers, taking a
31-3 lead into halftime.

“They had no reason to pass,”
said Pitt safety Louis Riddick.
“They could run the ball just
about as well as they wanted
IO. ~
Entering the game, Pitt had
given up a total of 199 rushing
yards, but Oklahoma eclipsed
that in the first half alone.

“You could see that the turf
was worn down and that the
field had a high crown
[reportedly 36 inches high in
the middle of the field]. That’s
for a reason,” said Riddick.
“They were coming downhill
awfully fast.”

Five of the Sooners’ seven
touchdowns were on plays of
25 yards or longer, and that

A  
Sooners passing bal1—no Way

Oklahoma game creates
more questions for Pitt

Hmmm....

-The Oklahoma game was supposed to answer a lot of questions
as to how good the Panthers really are this year. Instead, it ended up
creating a lot more questions. Was this game a fluke? Or is Pitt just
not that great a team? Is Syracuse, once considered a win by many,
now a lot tougher than it was last week? What will happen when Pitt
plays Notre Dame and Miami back to back?

01 caught up with Mike Gottfried while in Oklahoma — so to speak.
The former Pitt coach now has a weekly column in the Dallas
Morning News every Saturday during football season in addition to
his position as a game analyst for ESPN. -

Among the things Gottfried writes about is a list of his five toughest
stadiums to play in as a visitor —- '

1) Florida State, 2) Nebraska, 3)
Notre Dame, 4) Oklahoma, 5)
Penn State. Gottfried also writes
about the troubles that Michigan
Coach Gary Moeller will have
replacing Bo Schembechler, which
includes the line, “The toughest
thing for a coach to face is the day
he is no longer part of a team.”
-On my way to Owen Field on
Saturday, I stopped at a department
store and bought a red and blue
pens in order to keep score at the
game. (Pitt would be blue, and

 

OU would be red). Once the
game started, however, I found
out that my brand new crimson pen was a dud. Soon I discovered that
it was the only thing in red that didn’t work well on Saturday. 0

-Oklahoma had three players rush for 100 yards on Saturday. I find
that amazing. But the thing is, that is actually a somewhat regular
occurrence for the Sooners, although they haven’t done it since the
1987 Nebraska game. Yes, Pitt has done it too. It was in 1975 against
Kansas in the Sun Bowl. With Tony Dorsett leading the way (142
yards), and Elliott Walker (123) and Robert Haygood (101) following,
the Panthers won handily, 33-19.

-Overdue kudos should go to Pitt’s offensive line. Questioned
about their ability because of a lack of experience before the season

started, the group has solidified into a solid unit under Bill Meyers’ »

direction. Quarterback Alex Van Pelt has not been sacked yet this
year. That didn’t seem like a big deal after Ohio U. and BC, but
keeping the Sooners off Van Pelt is worthy of praise in itself.

“The offensive line did a hell of a job,” said Van Pelt. “I knowl say
that every week, but I think it’s about time that they get recognized.
[Oklahoma was] supposed [to be great], but our guys just came out
and stoned them.”

ioDo you think the Sooners are trying to dispel their image as a
football-only school? Before the game they handed out a press release
announcing that 113 OU freshmen are National Merit scholars, the
most in school history.

Swim team gets coach

By Jennifer Rozzell
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s swimming
team has won the Big East
Conference swimming
championship every year since
joining the league. This season
however, the team will have a
new coach to guide them.
Charles Knoles was named
head coach on July 25.

Knoles will replace Richard
Bradshaw, who resigned
earlier this year to dedicate his
time to teach physical
education at Pitt and to direct
the Pitt Aquatic Club.

Knoles has coached over 20
collegiate and hi gh—school All-
Americans. His most recent
head—coaching position had
been with the Fort Lauderdale
swim team, which he coached
since September of last year.

Before that, Knoles -was
interim head of the University
swimmin g
program in 1988. He led the
men’s and women’s teams to a
1Sth—place finish at the NCAA
Championships. The season
ended with 15 All—Americans
and NCAA finalists. Among

them was 1,650-meter national
swimming champion Mariusz
Podkoscielny, who arrived at
the Arizona campus the very
same day as Knoles.

“We are very pleased to
attract a coach of Chuck’s
caliber to the University of
Pittsburgh,” said Dean Billick,
Pitt’s associate director of
athletics upon announcing the
appointment “He conforms
with the university’s standards
of academic and athletic
achievement. We are looking
forward to a very successful
association with Pitt.”

“With Pitt’s tradition in
swimming in the Big East
Conference in the Eastern
region, and with Pitt’s national
prominence in college
athletics, being named head
men’s swimming coach at Pitt
is a tremendous thrill and
privilege,” said Knoles.

When asked why he came
to Pitt, Knoles said, “I see Pitt
as an opportunity  we have
both the financial and
academic resources to succeed
here. Pitt is nationally known
and a great place to go and
develop a program.

said Paul Yuna, the director of the Academic
Support Service. “The athletic department has
made an effort to let us help. We have had the
coaches’ support."

This service helps student athletes in many ways.
It is available to all student athletes, not just those
who play revenue sports (football and basketball).
Even athletes who left school early to pursue a
career and have since returned are allowed to use
the service. Yuna said, “Forty to 55 percent [of Pitt’s
student athletes] use the tutoring service.”

Computers are made available to the athletes, as
well as a chance to just talk to the staff. Learning
specialists are available to help with writing papers
and outlines.

“Some athlete is going to say, ‘I don’t need
Academic Support Service. I just need a computer
to use.’ I want them to know what is available,” said
Yuna. The Academic Support Service is currently
reviewing the final draft of a policy and procedures
guide which will be made available to all coaches
and student athletes later this term.

The service has five full-time staff members, a
secretary, a part—time worker who is a graduate
student and about 30 part-time tutors and clerical
assistants. They work closely with Bill Bryant,
assistant athletic director of academic affairs. Yuna

has reported to provost of undergraduate affairs’

Jack Daniel since 1980; before then he reported to
the dean’s office. Although Donna Sanft, assistant

athletic director of student affairs and compliance,
reports to athletic director Ed Bozik, not Daniel,
she said, “We are closely connected but separate.
Our duties often overlap.”

“Occasionally, [athletes] will come in with
unrealistic expectations [of what we can do for
theml," Yuna said when asked about athletes
coming in expecting to have the work done for
them. “But that is rare, and we straighten that out
immediately. ”

Another major part of the program is monitoring
the athletes’ academics. The service receives high-
school transcripts of all student athletes starting at
Pitt. The service also checks the grades and class
attendance of these students after the first day of
classes.

Some athletes’ class attendance is monitored
daily, especially athletes on academic probation,
those with past histories of academic problems, all
freshmen athletes and athletes who just can’t afford
to miss class because they don’t have the ability in
the classroom, according to Yuma. This is measured
by the class—card program, in which an athlete must
get each of his professors to sign an eligibility card
at the end of each week stating that she or he has
not missed class that week.

Yuna expanded on what he meant by those not .

having the ability in the classroom. He spoke of
many students who just aren’t prepared well by
their high schools, and others who aren’t able to
adjust to college life and living in a large city like
Pittsburgh. Sometimes athletes have a problem
because they have to declare a major by their junior
year. They can switch, but they have to be making
progress to a degree. Yuna suspects this policy is

Men's cross country team
takes first place at PSU

By Sharon Kerestes
Sta_,0“ W1-iter

Cross country coach Jim Lear
knew that if his men’s team could
beat Penn State last Saturday, it
would have a good shot at the
overall team title at the Spike
Shoe Invitational in State College,
and he was right. The Panthers
beat 11 teams at the invitational
and remain undefeated after two
meets.

As it turned out, Penn State
wasn’t even in the running for
second place. The University of
South Florida finished second
with 59 points behind Pitt’s 44.

Penn State placed third with 92. -

“We went out to beat Penn
State, and we figured we’d get
South Florida in the process,”
Lear said. “We just didn’t know
as much about them; whereas,
we know most of the kids from
Penn State.”

Keith Dowling was out in front
for Pitt and won the race in 24
minutes and 22 seconds. The
victory puts him well on the road
to becoming an All-American -
a goal Dowling has set for himself
this season.

“Every kid who’s ever won this
race has been an All-American,”
Lear said. “You have to be of All-
American caliber to win it because
of the level of competition there. ”

Pitt’s Scott Humphrey placed
sixth overall (25:04); Jason
Bodnar was 10th (25:24); Jim
Hamilton, 16th (25:40); Mike
Formica, 21st (26:01); Dave
Hackworth, 30th (26:18), and

Tom Swartout, 38th (26:25).
Overall, Lear was pleased with

the team’s ability to establish itself
as a group during the race. Last
week at Kent State, Pitt had five
runners place in the top six.

Although they were more spread 6

out at Penn State last Saturday,
they were still able to run together
at points during the meet.

“We work together as a group
in practice and try to continue it
in the meets,” Lear said. “The
group thing is the key to

everything because they are able 1

to pull each other along.”

Penn State won the women’s
meet, and West Virginia was
second. The Lady Panthers, still
bothered by injuries, placed sixth
overall. Stacey Wyzykowski
finished 10th individually in 19: 17,
and Laura O’Donnell finished
22nd in 19:53.

Carmella Marianni, one of the ,

three runners unable to run last
week, was back in the lineup for
Pitt on Saturday. Although that
helped the team, Lear is waiting
for the day when all his runners
will be able to compete.

“They're coming along. We just
need to get everybody healthy
and have our whole team out
there,” he said.

Both teams will face more tough '
- competition at West Virginia on

Sept. 29. The men’s victory
Saturday marked their first win
over Penn State since 1975, and
at the West Virginia meet they’ll
face Bucknell, another team who
has given them problems over
the years.

This Date in Pitt Football History
Sept. 17, 1977
In his first victory as Pitt’s head coach, Jackie Sherrill turned
to freshman Rick Trocano to replace injured Matt Cavanaugh,
in a 2&6 win over William and Mary.

Lady Panthers win V-ball tourney at Minnesota

By Ryan Buncher
Sta_[)“W1‘iter
The Pitt Lady Panthers

team won the
University of Minnesota Classic
at Williams Arena in Minneapolis
with victories last Friday night
against Colorado State (4-3) and
Saturday night against host
Minnesota (5-5). The team heads
into a match at Ohio State on
Wednesday night with a record
of 8-1. "

The match against Colorado
State was a hard—fought, ﬁve-
game win, and in Coach Sue
Woodstra’s words, “a weird
match.” The scoring was 15-11,
15-12, 12-15, 7-15, 15-7.

“Points were scored in big
streaks by both teams,” “C/oodstra
said. “They started off strong,
and we were comin g from behind
in every game.” '

When asked why the match
was so close, Woodstra said, “It

problem was the team’s season-
high 13 service errors.
“lWilliams Arena] is a big
building, and we’re notused to
that,” she added. “We weren’t
used to the high ceiling.” The
strange setting may help explain
the team’s relatively low kill
percentage of .200. Kill percentage
is calculated by dividing kills
minus errors by kills plus errors.
The team compiled 71 kills, led

him,” Noll said.

From that point on, it seemed
like the refs wanted to celebrate
ﬂag day a little early (or very late)
this year. Nine penalties were
called in the second quarter alone,
five on the Steelers and two of

those onjerrol Williams for lining _

up in the neutral zone.

In a rather successful imitation
of the Pitt Panther’s offensive (in)
ability from inside the opponent’s
20-yard line, the Steelers turned
three chances from the Houston
13-yard line into only three points
on a Gary Anderson 31-yard field
goal to take a 10-7 lead into the
locker room at the half.

The third quarter was quiet,
with Brister again leading an
offensive stampede, going two
for six for seven yards. The only
scoring came when Brister was
sacked in his own end zone for a
safety by left tackle Ray Childress,
to put the Oilers within one, 10-
9.

But that was all forjack Pardee’s

troops. Anderson nailed a 27- '

yard ﬁeld goal on the third play

by Ann Marie Lucanie_’s 20.
Michele Adarnson, Linda Zols and
Susan Zonneville each had 13
kills. Jenelle Lantagne provided
the team with 56 assists. Colorado
State bested the Lady Panthers in

digs, S9 to 52. Lucanie
accumulated 12 digs.
Woodstra was “very happy with

our play against Minnesota.” The
scoring went 15-13, 15-9, 15-12.
The championship match was
attended by 441 fans. Lucanie’s
12 kills topped the team, as did

‘17

of the fourth quarter to put
Pittsburgh ahead by four.

Then, Houston punter Greg
Montgomery put the ball into the
wrong hands. Woodson returned
the offering 52 yards for a TD to

cap the scoring with 11:49
remaining.
To illustrate the Steelers’

offensive plight, ponder this:
Merril Hoge gained nine yards on
NINE carries for a whopping 1.0
average. Pittsburgh punter Dan
Stryzinski had the second longest
run from scrimmage (9 yards) on
a fake punt attempt. Only Tim
Worley, who finished with 50
yards on 17 carries, had the longer
effort of 15 yards. The Steelers
also boasted an 8 percent
efficiency rate on third down,
going one for l3._

If that’s bad, maybe the Oilers ’

should consider keeping the run-
and-shoot offense where it
belongs -— in college. They threw
the ball 48 times and averaged
only 4.5 yards per play. They ran
the ball 16 times for 51 yards.

All that effort produced was a
lot less points than were needed,
and a lot of tired receivers.

Minnesota 45-37, led by Dee
MacAuley’s 14 digs. The team’s
hitting percentage was only .198,
and the number of service errors

well, losing only two games,”

Martial arts meets body building at Pitt

By Kenn Gaither
For The Pitt News

Ultimate Force 11, an exhibition
and competition in weightlifting
and the martial arts held yesterday
at Trees Hall, boasted two martial-
arts hall of famers, a nun who is
a black belt and the national
bench-press champion.

Over 200 competitors
participated in the various
branches of the martial arts —
including Kung Fu, Tae Kwon

Do and Karate — and the
bodybuilding/weightlifting
category.

Ultimate Force II is the
culmination of months of
planning by the Pittsburgh-based
Champions Association, the
brainchild of Bill Neal. Neal saw
the need for an organization that
“accepted Pittsburgh youth
without any limitations and taught
respect and love while
encouraging competition.”

Neal began the organization in
1975 with the motto, “Champions
are born, not made.”

The most visible program of
the association is the nationally
recognized Connie Hawkins
basketball league, which has
showcased the talents of players
such as former Panthers Charles

Smith and Clyde Vaughn.

The association, which receives
funds from city and corporate
sponsors, organizes over 50
programs per year while reaching
more than 50,000 people in the
Pittsburgh area.

The main objective is to reach
the youth of the city, according to
Bruce Cummings, a fourth-degree
black belt and member of the
Martial Arts Hall of Fame.

“We want to promote
brotherhood and make the kids
happy through good
sportsmanship and fair
judgement,” Cummings said.

The main impetus behind
Ultimate Force II was the duo of
Curtis Smith andjack Poindexter.

Smith is an internationally
known martial-arts expert who is
on the Champions Association
Board.

Poindexter is a Pittsburgh native
and the national bench-press
champion, who can lift 600
pounds. He is the only man in the
world to succeed at conquering
this weight at age 40.

Contestants ranged in age from
6 to 52. Though most were from
the tri-state area, some
competitors traveled from as far
away as New York and Canada.

accounted for more than half of
OU’s total offense.

“Pitt was able to do some things
offensively against our defense,
but overall we were dominating,”
said OU linebacker Chris Wilson.
“Pitt had only two quality players.

It was 11 against two [Van Pelt!,.
and Richards] in our favor. I’lI '

take those odds any time.”

Ouch! Not all the Sooners’
comments were that harsh,
however.

“I was scared to death
throughout the game,” said
Sooners Coach Gary Gibbs. “[Pitt
has] a good quarterback, good

receivers and good running backs. 4’

Their offense was knocking our
heads off early in the game. But
they dropped three or four, maybe
six passes on critical plays. They
moved the ball well but just
couldn’t get it in.”

There are actually some stats
that seem to indicate that the
game was closer than the score
suggests.

Pitt had more first downs than
OU (20-19) andthe same number
of penalties (three). The Panthers
also held the ball almost as long
as Oklahoma 60:57-29:03).

But it was the Sooners’ rushing
game that made the difference.
On offense, Oklahoma averaged

over 2-1/2 yards per play more

than Pitt (7.8-5.1).

game plan until they got that first
