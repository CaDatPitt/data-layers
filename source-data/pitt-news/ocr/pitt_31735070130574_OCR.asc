duo of drinks — the “diva delight” and the
“studly splash,” made of daiquiri mix, gin-
ger ale and ice, and milk, orange juice,
vanilla ice cream and ice, respectively.
The “divas” of Holland also ran away

with the most spirit award, likely for their _

sultry strut through the Towers patio, and
their homemade diva T-shirts. .
“It’s simple, but elegant,” said RA-

’ tumed-diva‘ Melissa Kobal.

The RAs from the Schenley
Quadrangle, representing McCormick,
Brackenridge and Bruce Halls, won most
original and best theme for their “dirty
money shot” mixture, which was served
by a sextet of cross—dressers.

The men were dressed as mobsters’
girlfriends, while the women’ posed as the
mobsters themselves. Their drink was
served in a handy plastic squirt gun.

Meanwhile, Lothrop RAs ran away ,

with the worst tasting mixture, a special
blend of Mountain Dew, Hawaiian Blue,
pickle juice, hot sauce, honey dijon mus-

' tard, peach iced tea and lemonade.
“It’ll warm you up,” said Gary Sokira, "G

resident director of Lothrop Hall.

_ Sokira and Quad RD Michele Griﬂilh
started the competition last year, after
moving from positions at California
University of Pennsylvania to their current
jobs at Pitt. '

jumped up and down in a circle. It was a
common phrase that rang throughout the
entire room. ‘

Students, overwhelmed with excite-~

ment, were hugging and taking pictures
with their new sisters. Some even took
time out to call home on their cell phones
to relay the good news to family.

“It’s unbelievable, it’s been a long
week and it’s good to know it’s ﬁnally
over and I got what I wanted,” junior
Theresa Pearson said. _ '

As students ‘ inside caught their

breath after all the excitement, sororities '

were outside just getting started. The
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority came
early to get a front row spot on the
Union’s steps. '

."‘I’m so excited, we waited so long.
We got great girls,” Wendy Branciforte
said. .

The women of Kappa Kappa

Gamma weren’t the only ones who.

excited. Their ma“s‘é‘ot Kappa‘ Kalee, a 

miniature schnauzer, was also excited for

her new sisters as she wagged her tail.
The sororities’ chantingbegan about

15 minutes before their new members

I burst out of the Union doors.

Tina Schmitt, a Kappa” Kappa
Gamma sister, remembered the ‘full she
had pledging.

“Looking back to how much fun I
had pledging, I’m really anxious for

them. It makes us closer every time we‘

get a new pledge class,” Schmitt said.

, Balloons, welcoming signs, and tall *
» poles holding up Greek letters ﬁlled the

cold air. Not one frown was present.

As the sororities continued to out- .
chant one another outside, women inside .

prepared to meet their new sisters. They
lined up in groups according to sororities.
The chanting was at its loudest when

the ﬁrst groups of ‘ girls rushed out of the .
4- double’ doors of the Union. A ’ .
Members of Chi Omega chanted, »

“Who’s that walkin’ down the ~stre,et,
looks so good, dressed so neat? All the

guys around will say ‘Chi Ornegas are
out today.’” - '

“It’s just “awesome,” Branciforte
said. It was simply put, butit was the
most accurate depiction of all the emo—
tion surrounding the large ' group of
women. ‘

When theapledges arrived to their
circle of new sisters, cameras ﬂashed,
hugs were exchanged and, in some
groups, white roses were handed to the
girls. , l

The chanting of each sorority started
up again, but with new voices. V

“I can’t believe you’re going to be
my sister,” one pledge said to another as
she put her arm around her.

_, The cheering never stopped even as
the sororities led pledges, to their new.

‘ houses.

New friendships were in the making‘

and sisterhood was about to begin for

180 women. A .

‘ ‘We love all girls we invited -into our
sorority,’-’ said Megan Tannous, 'a Delta

THE Pin News

Forum stresses the importance of

keepingstudents in Pittsburgh area

REHAN NASTR

Editor in Chief

When Peter Leone called Chancellor.

Mark Nordenberg two weeks ago and ,

asked him to attend a College President’s

V forum, he asked N ordenberg about the state

, of Pitt._

Nordenberg replied, “We just beat
Penn State.” ’ _ V '

Nordenberg ‘expanded on his impres-
sions of the University yesterday at the

0 forum, which was held in the Pittsburgh

Athletic Association on Fifth Avenue.

A The event was hosted by Pittsburgh’s
Next, a group with the mission to “inspire
and motivate the next generation to use
their talent and resources for the betterment
of lifein this region.” . E - ' _

Leone, president of Pittsburgh’s Next,
asked the presidents of Duquesne, Carnegie
Mellon, Chatham and Pitt to speak about
the state of their institutions and to address

the issue of keeping students in Pittsburgh -

after’ graduation. _ V _ _
‘ ‘‘It’s very important that we market this

area,” said Esther Barazzone, president of

Chatham College.

“We are in competition with areas like I
Boston and we need to make sure that there ,

are corporations which support our research
institutions.” . ,
Barazzone added that at Chatham,

there are programs which connect students ,

to the community early on in their college

. careers. During the ﬁrst week of school, stu-

dents are required to volunteer for Habitat
for Humanity ‘Even graduate students must
have a service project. — . .

- V Barrazzone said that while people may
be leaving the Pittsburgh area after gradua-‘
tion, area universities and employers should

_ work’ to welcomethem back to the area.

The audience of about 150 laughed
when Duquesne President John Murray Jr.

-said about his university, .‘.‘We’ve grown to

have the single largest garage facility in the

67-7777 ( Pick up and Catering)
421-9346 (For Delivery)

city.” .
0 Murray added that Pittsburgh is “one of

the better regions in the country” regarding ‘

higher education. Also, leaders in the area
are working to -increase the test scores of
students from kindergarten through grade
12. .

‘Many of our students are returning to

. the area,” Murray said. “And many students

who Italk to are very interested in staying.”

New stadiums on the North Shore are
part of the attraction and were the inspira-
tion for creating Pittsburgh’s Next.

“We started about two years ago to
motivate. people about the stadiums,” said
board member Ann Homak. “We’re trying
to get young professionals to work off their
apathy and get involved and interested with
what’s going on.” . _

Nordenberg spoke about Pitt’s record
growth over the last ﬁve years, citing the
newlbuildings, added research fimding and
hiring of faculty from prestigious schools.

' He also mentioned Pitt’s plans for the
future. T A ,
“Biotechnology will be one of the

largest areas of  in the future, and Pitt
is positioned well to take advantage of this,”

' he said.

He also took a fatherly approach to—stu—
dents. , _‘ _
“We know that our most fundamental
responsibility is E to take care of the stu-
dents,” he said.
Pittsburgh’s Next hosts four forums
arrriually. The next one, “Why Big Business

, Works in Pittsburgh,” will be held Nov. 9

and will feature CEOs from Pittsburgh
businesses. ‘ »

Games, Olympic fever is spreading.
For some, being aﬁlicted with the-
fever means a prognosis of spending
large amounts of time on the couch,
eyes glued to television coverage. In
others, a strain of the epidemic results
in the patient breaking out the o1’ exer-
cise bike and aspiring toward athletic
gloryofhisorherown.Andinrare
"cases, victims of the disease are so
overwhelmed with Olympic delight
that they become delusional and begin
proposing we hold the Games right
here in the ‘Burgh.

A notable case study from the last

category is Dr. Freddie Fu, the head of

sports medicine at Pitt, who

armounced at the dedication of the
UPMC Sports Medicine Center on
Monday that Pittsburgh might try bid-

ding to host the Olympics as early as

2012, though 2020 might be more fea-

sible. Mayor Tom Murphy and County
Chief Executive Jim Roddey are
apparently considering the possibility.
Perhaps Fu is not so delusional
after all. Maybe it is possible that

Pittsburgh 2020 could be more than a ‘‘

fever—bom hallucination.

After all, we have some facilities.
Especially with regard to rowing, as
everyone knows that Pittsburgh has
not one, not two, but three mighty ﬁne
rivers. And by 2020, we should have a

structed from relatively useless build-
ings on Pitt’s campus. Since there is no
Olympic-sized pool in Pittsburgh, we
can ﬂood the Litchﬁeld Towers
Garage —— who really needs parking
anyway? The high dive can be off of
the Towers themselves, which will also
serve as the Olympic Village.

A very large stadium (read: seat-
ing 100,000) will be needed for the
track and ﬁeld events. There is a quick
and easy solution to this — just join the
uncornpleted PNC Park and the yet—to-
be—named. Steelers  ~ ~

Because Pittsburgh is loaded in
spunk and spirit, we could even add a
few new events expressing our local
character. There are many’ possibilities

here — scaling the Cathedral of‘

Learning, power—washing the dirtiest

_ buildings in town, a steeplechase

involving panhandlers and NASCAR
at the aforementioned really big stadi-
um. .

Fu was right. With just a little
money and a lot of creativity, we can
introduce the rest of the world to the
high-class charm of Western
Pemisylvania and the beauteous athlet-
ic facilities of our city — which,’ much
like the heroes of the 2000 games, was
undoubtedly raised up in the spirit of
the Olympics, destined since birth for
the glory of the Games. «

challenged books in 1999 was the Harry,

Potter series by J .K. Rowlings, the Alice
series by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, “The
Chocolate War” by Robert Corrnier,
“Blubber” by Judy Blume, “Fallen Angels”
by Walter Dean Myers, John Steinbeck’s “Of
Mice and Men,” “I Know Why the Caged
Bird Sings” by Maya Angelou, “The
Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood, “The
Color Purple” by Alice Walker and David
Guterson’s “Snow Falling on Cedars.”

The most common complaints were-- that
books in question were too “sexually explic-
it,” “unsuited to age group,” or had “occult
themes or promoted the occult or Satanism”
(particularly in the case of Harry Potter).
Othercomplaints were about violence, same-
sex relationships, racism or books that were
‘.‘anti-family values.” 7

Why is Banned Books Week an important
annual holiday that every American should
know about and celebrate? I don’t want others
to decide what is and isn’t appropriate for me
to read. I especially don’t want overly sensi-
tive people who are offended by almost any-

the types who challenge books. '
I am particularly troubled by the case of

the Harry Potter series; J .K. Rowling’s stories

about a young wizard have been challenged in

Minnesota, Michigan, New York, California ’
. and South Carolina. Some parents have gone

so far as to describe the books as “evil” to a
. These people to have missed the
books — Harry is a sensitive and

good. This series is one of the

Almost popular children’s literature has seen in_

years and has kids reading voraciously.
Furthermore, banning books isn’t a good
idea because restricting things only makes
them more appealing, especially to young
' people. For example,<a few years ago in my
hometown, high school students were
assigned to read “Gorillas in the Mist,” an

account by Zoologist Dian Fossey of her time , '

spent in Africa observing gorillas ﬁrsthand.
The students were provided with copies of the
book by the school,'but the passages in the
book that’ described the gorillas having sex
were blacked out with permanent marker! As
soon as the students discovered that they had

, been denied the chance to readabout gorilla

sex, they rushed out to local bookstores to
purchase unabridged versions of the book.
I find it amusing that certain educators

didn’t want to expose their students to gorilla '. - '

sex. They forget ‘how raunchy prime—time
television has become. But it’s ‘a mistake to

havea good laugh about this and ‘then forget
it. -‘ "

A little negative
reinforcement
goes a long way  

Perhaps I spoke too soon, or
maybe my column two weeks ago was
bulletin-board material, but Cande
Ruiz of the Pitt women’s soccer team
has turned it up a notch. _

On Sept. 15, Ruiz had, just one
goal in her last 20 games, but since the
column was published, she scored
three goals in four games taking over
the scoring lead for the ‘Panthers.

Ruiz had two goals against Robert
Morris, including -the game winner,
and added a goal at Seton Hall. A

Way to go, Cande. I like eating my
words when it comes to Pitt sports
teams.

- You cannot be serious. The city
of Pittsburgh couldn’t host the

Pittsburgh gets? Is this another one of ,
those ploys to get Pittsburghers inter-

much better as onebig unit.”

Tobler has appeared in every game -

for the Panthers this season and was the
only player last season to start in all 18
games. _

It is an impressive stat, but it is

even more impressive that in. 1998,’

Tobler tore her anterior cruciate liga-
ment during practice in a non—contact
shooting drill. The injury ended her
season and forced her to take a medical
redshirt. - . - .
‘At first, Tobler was not aware of

the severity of the injury, believing it

was atom meniscus, but after the initial
shock of finding out it was an ACL tear,
she became very dedicated to her reha-
bilitation‘ and returned. to the soccer
field. ' . * _

“I couldn’t do anything. Do you
know what it’s like to not be able to do
anything?” Tobler asked. ‘~‘Do you

know how‘ horrible that is? so when

you can’t do anything, everything you
get to do [in rehab] is like a big freedom
so you go after it with everything.”
Tobler currently has a 3.5 grade
point average and was a University
Scholar-Athlete and'Big East Academic
Al1—Star last season. " j .

“[The competition at the meet this ‘

weekend] is just as good as it gets,”
Freeman said. '

Many of the top finishers at the,

Spiked Shoe will be in Schenley Park
this weekend. 1

_ Among them are ‘Dayton — the
men finished seventh out of 26 teams

and the women finished sixth out "of ,

25 teams at Penn State —’— and
Bucknell, the men took eighth and the
women fourth.

The Pitt men finished 12th and the
women ﬁnished 13th at the meet.

Malone College, one of the top
teams in Division II,‘ will also be in
attendance. .

The Panthers go into the meet
with all of their top runners coming
off some of their best performances’ at

the Penn State meet.

For’ the men, senior Mike Head
and freshman Mike Diano'lead, and
for the women, junior Amanda

Schmidt and freshman Dawn Hilgert. -

The Schenley course will ‘not be
the same as it was a few weeks ago,
because the teams will have to run

: courses of different lengths, with the
-men running five vmiles and the

women-running 5,000. meters.

By adding at-large bids _to the
NCAA Cross Country championships,
the sport has taken another page out of
college basketball and has put a new
spin on the season. . - ,_ -

With the at-large bids, Freeman
sees’ the meets in October as even
more important than they used to be.
