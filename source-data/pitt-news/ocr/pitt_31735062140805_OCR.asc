 the Naval Reserve.

.r-

 

Three years ago he received or-
ders to active duty with the At-
lantic Fleet. He served on a de-
stroyer that was transferred to
Great Britain in the “ships for
bases” trade. A year and a half
ago he was transferred to the Pa-
ciﬁc Fleet and in November of
1.941 was stationed at Manilla.

wt When war started he went to Ba-
* _taan and was there for a part of
_;_,,the “Battle of Bataan.”

When Bataan fell he escaped
to Corregidor and when that
., fortress was captured he was
listed as missing by the Navy
department. No word had been
heard until a short time ago
when the Navy notiﬁed his par-
ents, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Mur-
chison, 275 Ashland avenue, Mt.
Lebanon, that their son was a
prisoner of the Japs. After long
’.months of unrest this message
came as a Godsend.

While at Pitt, Bill was quite ac-
tive in University aﬁ"airs. He was
on the tennis team, in Cap and

« Gown productions, a member of the
YMCA cabinet, and Phi Gamma

V

‘-7 Delta. He also was a cheerleader

‘District Business Reports
Unchanged Conditions

Business conditions remained un-
changed for the third consecutive
week in the Pittsburgh district, ac-
cording to the Bureau of Business
Research, University of Pitts-
burgh.

The Steel industry in the Pitts-
burgh district operated at 101 per
cent of capacity, a rate fraction-
ally above that in the preceding
week. No change was reported in

w the number of active blast fur-
{ naces; bituminous coal production

was the best in the past four
weeks. Thus, it appears that the
forward buying wave which pre-
vailed during most of February has
probably run its course. Combined
sales of Pittsburgh department
stores in the first 11 weeks of 1943
exceeded those in the same period
of 1942 by three per cent.

R. Frank Fulton
Will Address
Y M Members

R. Frank Fulton, wel1-knownlec-
turer and educator, will be the
guest of YMCA members and
friends on Thursday at one o’clock
in 132 Cathedral. Mr. Fulton, who
has just returned from China, will
speak on the subject “China Under
Fire.” Much of his experience has
been in the college ﬁeld.

For two years Mr. Fulton was on
the faculty of Yale-in-China at
Changsha, teaching also at Hunan

University, a government institu-
tion. During his vacations he trav-
eled widely in all parts of China.
He returned to the United States
via Siberia, joining the Sherwood
Eddy seminar in its travels in the
U.S.S.R.

While he was in Europe he at-
tended a conference of the Con-
fessional Church at Hannover
and an international missionary
conference at Basic, where he
was one of the student speakers.

Another period in China was
spent as: a lecturer at Yenching
University in Peiping, followed by
vacation travel in Japan, Korea,
Manchuria. His last few months in
China were spent in _Free China,
where he went through two severe
bombings in Changsha and Hsiu-
chow. On his return, Mr. Fulton
did graduate work at Yale, where
he has just completed his disserta-
tion for his Doctorate of Philoso-
phy. At present, prior to his re-
turn to China, Mr. Fulton is serv-
ing on the staff of the World Stu-
dent Service Fund. His thorough
knowledge of student life here, in
the Orient, and in Europe, plus his
ﬁrst-hand experience of life in
refugee universities in China well
equip him for the work of inter-
preting student war relief.

 Br LESTER GILBERT

_ , Pitt students liked “Knickerbock-

 er Holiday” from before the foot-
l -lights. What went on behind the

footlights is another story.
l Curt Greenberg, C44, dance di-
rector and stage manager of
“Knickerbocker Holiday," in a
daring expose over a couple of
‘cakes (ersatz) in the Tuck Shop,
_has revealed that it is there that
’ stark drama and uproarious com-
 can be found.
When Curt creaks down the
narrow stairs and steps out on
to the Stephen Foster Memo-

i_ rial stage, he is confronted by

blank walls, a blank stage and
Dave Barbour-’s blank face. Dave
, is-C theelectricia-n and at the mo-
ment he is aimlessly wandering
from one connection to another
in search of a plug that always
;seems’ over the next rainbow.
Curt usually says helloto Dave,
but this time he is too busy try-
ing to keep the ambitious elec-
'tﬁcian- from ramming a plug
down his epiglotis. After con-
 Dave that his throat is
not the proper place, for the spot
.A.li£ht—-plug‘, Curt continues on his
vra_x‘._ ' H. ‘

  
 

rooms, ﬁve chorus girls surround
our hero demanding new steps,
larger parts, higher wages, and
fewer hours. After paying the
girls off in last ycar’s football cou-
pons, Curt retreats to his own
room and locks the door. Fifteen
minutes later he arrives at the
make-up room.

_ Then the real bedlam begins.
Makeup artists glue beards on
chorus girls and smear lipstick all
over Jimmy Dunn. This is the first
sign of ‘nerves. Light grease is
nonchalantly mixed with dark and
costumes are padded and tied until
the thespians move as mechanical-
ly as Sir Lancelot in full dress. By
this “time the entire chorus has as-
sembled and the girls are throwing
adjectives to the wind. The result-
ing din is a reasonable facsimile to
the cheering section when Pitt
made its touchdown.

After a makeup artist has
spent 30 minutes removing a
girl's former face and supplant-
ing it with something out of a
jar, the female invariably re-
tires to a neutral corner for an-
other twenty minute session with
her visage. Dunn, in the mean-
time. is acreaning_“Don’t,do.» it!’

that a few dark lines would work
wonders for his face. When Jim-
my regains consciousness he
dashes to the mirror, covers his
eyes with an upraised arm and
slumps to the ﬂoor sobbing.

Mr. Finney, the musical director,
walks sedately across the apron of
the stage polishing the little glass
dog which he carries for luck. This
occasion warrants his presence
with the Pitt Players, so Mr. Fin-
ney rubs the lucky piece a little
harder. Curt tiptoes across the
stage and politely taps the Macs-
tro with a clenched fist. Mr. Finney
has already read Curt’s mind, and
he whips out his violin. Margie
Beale follows him down into the
orchestra pit, and being a ‘gentle-_
man he helps her unstrap the
piano off of her back.

At 8:05 the cast is ready to
go. At 8:13 Mr. Whitehill checks
over the stage and asks Curt if
all is well. Curt usually says no,
but Mr. Whitehill usually ignors
Curt because he always says no.
The two-piece orchestra roars
into overture, the houselights
come down, the curtain goes up,
and the chorus quiets down long
enough to ‘open up 'with'‘ the

YW Girls Knit Coverets
For Refugee Children

YWCA girls are knitting for
the war. This time they are knit-

yarn for those who are willing to
spend a little of their time.

Alumni Grants Support
To University Leadership

At a meeting of Alumni Coun-
cil, March 15, 1943, the members
were unanimous in their support
of a resolution commending the
leadership of the University of
Pittsburgh in the specialized train-
ing of men and women for various
branches in War Service.

The University has been se-
lected as one of the largest and
most important centers for train-
ing the personnel of the Armed
Forces of the United States. To
serve this purpose a large part
of the Cathedral .of Learning has
been transferred into dormitory,
mess hall, and class-room facili-
ties to accommodate the large
number of trainees now assigned
to this Center. The regular Uni-
versity program has been ar-
ranged to meet, primarily, the
instructional needs of the train-
ees, and the University faculty
-is being employed to stall’ the
academic phase of this program.
The Council takes pride in the
remarkable achievement attained
to date and the promise of still
‘greater achievements as the pro-
gram developes.

ister of Shadyside Presbyterian
Church, will address Pitt students
at the Pitkin club meeting tomor-
row night. His subject will be
“What is the Christian Church Do-
ing in Japan Today?”

Dr. Dalzel1’s address will follow
at the
church.

Post Office Changes Rules

For Packages

The ﬁrst-class or letter rate of

cel would be twenty-four cents.

Regular newspapers and maga-
zines may not be mailed under this
provision but a written request for
the subscription must be received
from the member of the Armed
Forces. If this request is made to
the member of the family or a
friend, it should be submitted to
the publisher (or something in
substantiation thereof) when the
subscription is placed.

Parcels over 8 ounces will be ac-
cepted only if they contain articles
being sent at the speciﬁc written
request of the addressee, approved
by the commanding officer. The
written request‘ must be submitted
to the post office when the parcel
is mailed. Such parcels may not
exceed 5 pounds in weight, not
15 inches in length, not 36 inches
in length and girth combined."

The Post Oﬂice Department has
