Caliguiri Storls campaign

At Oakland Headquarters 

By TOM KUKUCKA

Mayor Richard Caliguiri officially ,

opened his Oakland mayoral.
campaign headquarters on Atwood
St. Saturday afternoon.

Caliguiri, who is ﬁlling out former
Mayor Peter Flaherty’s term of
office, is seeking election in his own
right. He, and‘ his family were
greeted by campaign workers and

supporters, as he met with Oakland r

area residents from two to four
p.m., and answered ‘their. ques-
tions.

Running against Republican Joe
Cosetti and Democrat Tom Foerster
on the “Pittsburghers for Cali-
guiri” ticket, the mayor, an
independent candidate, conceded
that Oakland (4th Ward) has been a
Democratic stronghold in the past,
but said he felt he would dowell in
the area.

SGB Reinstates LAC Head Stephen

» ﬂ:_ ; - -mm‘, . ,,.,

if ByMARKCE NDER "

glkeversing an earlier decision,
the Student Government Board

reinstated Bruce Stephen as the
chairman of the Legal Awareness
Committee (LAC) last Friday.

“The whole incident occurred
because of a lack of communication
between the board and myself. I
feel if the SGB had been aware of
the work I’d been doing, none of this
would have happened,” Stephen
said.

Stephen said at the time of the
SGB’s decision to terminate him,
the board was not aware of the work
he had been doing during the
summer months because of the way

“Members of the board would

look in my office and no one would
be working there,”Stephen said.
“The board then assumed no work
was being done, when actually I’d
be doing most of my work through
the answering service, not in my
office.”

The SGB’s earlier motion" to
terminate Stephen as chairman of
the LAC was based on his
inaccessibility to students who
required the LAC services.

According to SGB member Josh
Baylson, the‘ Friday board meeting
was an apology to Stephen because
the board did not allow him to
present his case before its
announcement of his removal from

Heinz Chapel field looked alive this weekend, as two
intramural football teams battled each other. There were
no cheerleaders, sports announcers, rowdy fans or

‘ ‘Thebolard realized Bruce didn't
receive due process because he was
unable to present his case before
the board,” Baylson said.

The SGB rescinded the motion to
terminate Stephen after his pre-
sentation before the board.

Baylson said within the next two ‘

months the SGB will evaluate
Stephen’s accomplishments as LAC
chairman, but the evaluation "will
not be aimed solely on Stephen and

‘ the LAC.

“The evaluation is a routine
procedure therSGB does on all of the
chairmen,” Baylson said.

Baylson said if the evaluation
shows that Stephen’s work is not
satisfactory to the SGB, he will be
terminated as LAC head.

players probably didn't care.

“People are changing their
thoughts and opinions about elected
ofﬁcials, and I feel they are going to
view my candidacy as one that they
want to support. That’s the
difficulty with the (Democratic)
organization; it takes people for
granted. » I intend to work for
everybody’s vote.” Caliguiri said.

Speaking at the “Oaklanders for
Caliguiri” headquarters, the mayor
also expressed oon_cern over the
impact the student vote could have
in the November election.

“It’s an important vote, there’s

no doubt about it, if only because of A

the number of students that go to
the universities, be it Pitt,
Duquesne, Carnegie~Mell‘on,
wherever. I would hope the young
people would get involved in
politics”, he 

Caliguiri said he believes a large,

turnout in the student vote would
beneﬁt his cause.

“ ‘I think if I’m able to get students
out’ to vote, they . would be
supportive of my administration,”
the mayor stated. ,“Number one.
most of them realize now that with
me, it's good government ﬁrst. Not
good politics. I view them as
neighbors of this community. Their

concerns and problems, are my‘

ooncems and problems and I want
to help them.”

Caliguiri was asked if he planned 

to speak and actively campaign on
the Pitt campus. j

“I don’t know if there is a date
already set,” he said. “If there
isn't, I’m ready to go out there. I’d
probably go out there without being
invited to any formal meeting. I do
want to let the students know that
we’re going to work together. I
will come back again and again to

stand up before them and be iudged P

as to what I’m doing "in my
administration.” '

Fairly Good News

Two recent events concerning academic life at Pitt could be good
news for students, but we caution most students not to become too
excite_d over the changes.

 
 

   

One involves a revision of the academic integrity code. A new
provision makes it possible for a student found guilty of an
infraction to remain in school during an appeal. This is a necessary
extension of due process, and it is welcome, but it “will not affect
many students and does not make the privilege of attending classes
bending disposal of the appeal automatic. A needed change would
allow a convicted student to attend classes until all appeals are
denied. Allowing the student to attend class would not help a
student whose guilt is reaffirmed, but the denial‘ ,of that
opportunity would cause irreparable—and unjust—-per-a ty to a
student whose appeal is upheld.

The second bit of academic news has a greater chance to aid the
average student, though we’re not confident it will. The Center
for the Evaluation of Teaching plans to publish an undergraduate
academic review during winter term, and student government plans
to distribute it. We only hope they plan to make it worth
distributing. a

Following this announcement, pro-
tests and sit-ins began. Out of all
this came the May ‘4th Coalition.

The goal of this coalition is to stop
the construction of the gymnasium
on that site. It certainly is a tragedy
that this gymnasium probably will
be built there. But instead of
merely talking about the deaths of
the four students, we must
remember why they were killed. S

They were protesting the war iii
Vietnam, an anti-imperialist war
waged by the peoples of Vietnam
against United States imperiialism
(the world system of . ‘monopoly
capitalism). Today, all oppressed
peoples of the world are rising up
against imperialism. We see the
people of Southern Africa, espec-

ially in Azania (South Africa) and

Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) waging lib-
eration struggles. In the Middle-
East the Palestinian people are
actively ﬁghting Zionism, the irri-

perialist force backed wholeheart-
edly by the United States. It seems
that if we really want to remember
the four students at.Kent State, we
will participate in supporting the
struggles of the third world. Their

[opposed imperialism everywhere.

The May 4th Coalition does not
carry its struggles forward. This is
clearly seen in that its goal is to stop
the buildingof the gymnasium. To
remember these students, its goal

would be to oppose actively

present-day imperialism and to
build support for these peoples’
struggles, the way those students
helped build support for the peoples
of Vietnam. By the May 4th
ignoring this, is romanticizing these
students and the anti-imperialist
war support of the 60s.

volutionary. It is only a left facade
because it is objectively taking work
away from concrete liberation
struggles being waged today. And
those who don ’t work for revolution
work against it.

So don’t be fooledby the May 4th
Coalition. Work to have students at
Pitt join in actively fighting
imperialism, and building a strong
base of support for liberation
struggles. -

Dorothy South Victim of Institutional Violence

It was a moving experience to
accidentally wander into a news
conference held Sept. 29 at the
Universiy Women's Center, just
prior to a memorial service for Dr.
Dorothy South, who recently took
her own life after being.“termi-
nated” by the University. Some
aspects of that situation deserve

wide attention.
Ms. South apparently "sent out

200 applications for employment
after being given six months notice
that because the financial grant
supporting her work was coming to
an end, so was her employment
here. It is not significant to decide
whether she took her life out of
gespondcncy at  declared
"unneeded” by society in the field
for which she had been trained.
What struck me was one reference,
made by the woman minister who
was about to conduct the memorial
service, to the “institutional
violence” that can cause lndlvl:
duals to die many "small deaths
before they reach “ultimate
death.”

We are very slow to recognize:
in the University community that
with universities in general ap-
proaching a period of “retrench-
ment,” or “limited growth,” it
becomes more necessary thantever
to develop humane ways of dealing
with human problems involved.
Unlike business, and in many cases
government, we have no estab-
lished processes involving “sever-
ance pay,” helping people get
other employment, etc. All our
processes are based on the
underlying premise, now a false
premise, that employment is
always easy to ﬁnd for those the
University decides to “’tei-minate.”
And we do, of course, fail to
recognize that this form of
“institutional violence” is just as
ugly and ﬁnal as murder itself.
After all, the indivdual already

.designated as “unwanted” has a

difficult time deciding it is
desirable to “live” at all.
ldisagree, at least in part, with
zhose in the women’s movement
who look upon a situation of this

sort as purely and simply a matter
of discrimination. If all positions at
the University were held by
women, and if the same situation
then obtained, the results would be
precisely the same. Hence, the
problem cannot be solved by
looking upon it as a problem of
“equal opportunity” or “afﬁrma-
tive action” or even the Equal
Rights Amendment. Sooner or
later, we have to see that we are
entering an era wherein none of our
accustomed ways of making de-
cisions can work. It is time, as the
minister noted: to stop “blaming
the victims” of the situation for
their own demise, or simply
dismissing them as “weak” people
who cannot “cope” with life. Our
institutions, given their very
design, must become ever more
violent as “limits to growth”
approach. unless we seriously think
about changing them. Contrary to
one of Betty Friedan’s statements
at the same news conference, we
are not managed by “evil"
administrators. only by individuals

trapped in the same system. This
does not excuse us, however, from
ﬁnding ways of “terminating”

their ability to act as executioners. ,

We must begin to save them from
themselves.

senior, I am sure you got to choose
your place of residence for this year.

Anyone who decides to live in the

Quad should realize that t J 9,
always will be “one a.m. frisb - if

tournaments” and occasionally
“ordered noise” as you choose to
call it. It’s a real shame that you
used your choice so poorly.

I coordinated RSA’s evening
entertainment with the hope that it
would provide many students with
an enjoyable evening of open-air

P

music. Many students did enjoy

themselves and the RSAreceived
many compliments about the event.

If you think such programs don’
belong in the Quad, then why don’t

“wit

you take a more active voice in RSA.

Your ideas and suggestion always
will be welcomed. Don’t criticize
RSA programming in retrospect.
After all, we’re just trying to make
the residence halls a better place to
live. You’ve been here for four
years so you must know that. Your
apathy isn't making the residence

By the way, the Alcampipeline
is about to be built.

Within months, the Northwesg

Energy Company will begin as-
sembling the 2,700 mile natural gas
line recently agreed upon by
President Carter and Canadian
Prime Minister Trudeau. Running
from Alaska's North Slope to the
United States-Canadian border, the
Alcan pipeline will eventually
deliver 2.2 billion cubic feet of gas
per day to the energy hungry
American Middle West. Cost of

contructionwill be something over , f

$10 billion.

Although it is being billed as
“the largest project in the history
of the world,” the new gas
transmission line has generated a
remarkable lack of controversy in
the United States. Government,
industry ‘and the few citizens
familiar with Alcan all seem to feel
the pipeline is obviously needed,
the technical problems can be
solved and that is about all there is
to it. ‘

But that is not all there is to it.
Construction of the Alcan pipeline

jg. poses unique problems and raises

important questions for Canadians
and,American alike.
The Canadian government at

‘Berger, if these » complex issues

were to be dealt with properly".

Due at least in part to the Berger
Commission’s report, the Artic Gas
pipeline proposal was rejected.
Instead,-with a ﬂourish that smells
a little like issue-evasion, the Alcan
route was approved.

The Northwest Energy Company
was a late entry in the pipeline
contract competition,
result, no thorough investigation
has been made regarding the Alcan
route’s environmental impact. The
fact that the Alcan pipeline will

can afford less and less. In view of
admitted limits to non-renewable
energy resources, isn’t it a bit rash
to insist upon continuing that kind
of “growth?”

world goes begging, there ought to

$10 billion to $14 billion dollars on
energy to fuel an economy based
largely on the production of
non-essential consumer goods.

pay a high “price for our plastic toys
and convenience living. 'As one
Canadian put it, isn’t construction
of a new natural gas pipeline at this
point in time rather like giving
whiskey to an alcoholic?

on pipeline construction would

Justice Berger concluded that it

it means roads, airstrips, ware-

FOR THE REST OF YOUR
SENIOR YEAR. 

If you are interested in math, physics or engineering,
the Navy has a program you should know about.

It’s called the NUPOC-Collegiate Program (NUPOC
is short for Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate), and if
you qualify it can pay you as much as $611 a month for
the remainder of your senior year. Then after 16 weeks of
Officer Candidate School, you will receive an additional
year of advanced technical education, education that
would cost thousands in a civilian school, but in the
Navy we pay you. And at the end of the year of training,
you’ll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. « I

It isn’t easy. Only one of every six applicants will be
selected, and there are fewer than 300 openings. But
those who make it ﬁnd themselves in one of the most
elite engineering training programs anywhere. With  
unequalled hands—on responsibility, a $24,000 salary in
four years, plus travel, medical benefits and education
opportunities.

The Pitt Band and cheerleaders
are partners in a very important
business venture on campus-—en-
tertaining the crowds who turn out
for Pitt football games Saturday
afternoons at Pitt Stadium.

Their venture has been success-
ful so far. It is safe to say Pitt
football wouldn’t- be half as
exciting, half as colorful, if it
weren’t for Pitt’s “football enter-
tainers,” the Pitt Band and
cheerleaders.

It is also safe to say that neither
the band nor cheerleaders would be
half as entertaining without the
long, hard hours of practice turned
in by each. There is more to putting
on a halftime and pre-game show
and cheering for the home team
than what ordinarily meets the eye.

The band has three two-hour
practice sessions a week during
football season, plus an annual
week-long band camp in late

August.

For band director Don Hower,
there also are other details that
need to be addressed,- in order for
the band to put on a successful
pre-game and halftime show.

“There's a few important things

~ you mustarrange,” Hower said.

“Selecting the appropriate music,
planning the correct formations,
just putting the show together.”
Hower has received considerable
help in putting the show together
this year from drum major Leo
Homzec. Hower considers Homzec,
a rookie as far as drum majors go,
“the quarterback of his team”
much like Matt Cavanaugh (when

not injured), Rick Trocono or
Lindsay Delaney are for the
Panthers.

“There’s not much I can do with
Leo,” Hower said. “He’s just one
of the ﬁnest’ drum majors around.
He’s taken a lot off of my shoulders.
He helps run the rehearsals. ‘It's a
combined effort between us to see
that theband does a good job.

“Leo has done his part in seeing

some of Pitt's chqorloodsrs on display.

The energy of “Miss Cheerlead-
er  is a beneﬁt to each
Panther football game. Pitt
cheerleader Sue Murphy won the
title this summer in a contest held
in Cyprus Gardens. Fla.

The contest was sponsored by
the Pepsi-Cola and Kodak Com-
panies_. They sent letters to the ﬁve
colleges with the top football teams
and each school selected a
cheerleader as their representa-
tive. Pitt chose Murphy, who,
because she had scored the most
points at tryouts. was its top
cheerleader.

Murphy, a junior psychology
major from Brentwood, said she
felt “privileged to be selected to

represent Pitt in the contest.”

Murphy practiced for a month to
prepare for the competition. The
sponsors paid for all expenses of
her journey to Florida. In addition
to numerous photography sessions,
her trip included tours, waterskiing
and hang-gliding.

The contestants were judged on
the basis of talent, personality,
appearance and enthusiasm.
When the most intense moment

what we do well on the ﬁeld,”
Hower added.

“During the week, I'll help Leo
with rehearsals,” Hower said. “I’ll
suggest things to him. But on
Saturday afternoon, when the game
comes, it’s basically his responsi-
bility. He’s out on the ﬁeld
directing the band. I’m usually up

 in the stands watching.

“Fortunately, I have conﬁdence
in Leo. Ithink the band members
have conﬁdence, in him, . too,”
Hower continued. “He’s got to be
one of the ﬁnest drum majors Pitt
has ever had.”

Hower sounds much like Jackie
Sherrill praising Cavanaugh or
Trocano or Delaney.

There is one part of the band the
male spectators at Pitt Stadium are
particularly interested in,’ the
ever-popular Golden Girls. Accord-
ing to Hower, the girls in the ﬂashy
gold sequinced outﬁts weren't so
popular at one time. At least not in
other band members’ eyes. The
band director now believes the
attitudes of the rest of the band
toward the girls has changed during
the past few years.

“Three years ago when we
started the Golden Girls,” Hower
explained, “there were some bad
feelings. Theband members didn’t
really like the attention the girls got.
But I noticed that they have sort of
grown accustomed to them. They
have accepted them as part of the
band. I can really see no more
animosity on the part of the band
members toward the girls.”

To be sure, if the boots and
hollers and assorted whistles cast
upon the girls by many men in Pitt
Stadium are any indication, there is
certainly no animosity on the part of
male spectators.

They seem to adore them.

Another thing is for sure, too, and
that is the fact that Pitt
cheerleaders, like Pitt Band mem-
bers, also are a hard-working
group. If you want to be a Pitt
cheerleader for any length of time,
you almost must live, eat and sleep
cheerleading.

V From early April, right after
tryouts and several weeks prior to
the annual Pitt spring football
game, to January (if Pitt makes it to
a bowl game), the Pitt cheerleaders
ﬁnd themselves in one perpetual
round of practice and preparation.
If it isn’t for the season, it’s for next
week.

came and the judges announced
her as “Miss Cheerleader, U.S.A."
Murphy felt anything but noncha-
lant.

‘‘It was so unbelievable." she
said. “When they said my name. it
was like a dream. It was a once in a
lifetime thrill."

The announcement was followed
by interviews with United Press
International and The Associated
Press. She received a $500
scholarship. a Kodak camera, a
trophy and a plaque. She also had
the seat of honor in the victory
dinner.

Cheerleading is nothing new to
Murphy. She ﬁrst became a
cheerleader in the seventh grade.
She was a cheerleader for the next
ﬁve years and at the end of her
freshman year at Pitt. she made the
squad here.

Murphy’s success hasn’t made
her overconﬁdent, however. I’ll be
a cheerleader again (next year), ifI
make it." she said. “You can't
take anything for granted.”

Murphy doesn't believe that
cheerleaders or football players
should be_regarded in any special
way. “Athletes are no different

we've given up.
“We want to convey the .

than anyone else.” she com-
mented. “Some people tend to put
them in a category separate from
others. but they shouldn't.”

The cheerleading squad has two
three-hour practices every week.
In addition. they practice
summer and attend cheerleading
camp for four days. As a result. the
squad is in top shape. Murphy
doesn't ﬁnd it difﬁcult. however. to
ﬁt cheerleading into her academic
schedule.

She laughed at the idea of
becoming a professional cheer-
leader. “I need something with
more of a future.. ; and said she
sees psychology as her probaLI;

Cheerleaders must maintain
their enthusiasm during even the
grimmest moments of a game.
“We don't want the crowd to think

plained.
message. ‘We still can do it.’ so we
have to remain peppy and smiling,
and always do our best.”

Murphy is optimistic even about
the subject of losing. “You have to
lose in order to appreciate
winning."

When The First Half Ends, They Take Over I“

Pitt band members In a relaxed mood.

Last year, the work load was even
harder when Pitt's cheerleaders
cheered for the basketball team, in
addition_to the football Panthers.
Since basketball ‘season starts in
November, Pitt cheerleaders were
busy preparing cheers for two
separate sports into early January
and Sugar Bowl time.

With the recent formation of a
separate cheering squad for bas-
ketball season, a similar situation
will not recur. -

“We were kind of shortchanging
ourselves and the basketball
team,” Pitt cheerleader coach
Karen Augustinella said.

With ‘the creation of another
squad, football cheerleaders will be
given a few more months to rest
their vocal cords and in some cases,
recover from injuries sustained
during the season. The cheerlead-
ing squad also has an injury list, not
unlike that of the football team.

“We have an injury list, too,”
Augustinella said. “We have our

share of ankle sprains, shoulder and
knee problems, just like the football
players do.”

I In Augustinella’s opinion, the
football team and cheerleading
squad also have something else in
common besides an injury list-
mutual respect one coach has for th
coach of the other team.

“A coach of any other team
respects the team effort involved in
getting ready for a particular
event,” Augustinella stated. “He
or she realizes the hours of
preparation put in achieving this
team effort.

“Jackie Sherrill is no different,”
she continued. “He realizes we
have quite a job in front of us each
week preparing for the upcoming
game. He’s been very supportive.”

Even more so than his predeces-
sor, Johnny Majors, he of the green
and red ﬂag-waving, pride and
enthusiasm school of cheerleading?

Chi: “How can you write a letter
like that without ‘isiting any
fraternity houses or talking to any
‘brothers’?” This year I realize
there was validity to his question.

So this year that’s exactly what I
_ did: went to the houses and talked
ﬁne the “brothers.” This time
around, I am taking a good look at
fraternities‘ from a consumer
standpoint. I’m looking not only
into the shape of the houses and the
intramurals and charities frats are
involved in, but the fees and dues.
As when shopping for groceries,
you should be a smart buyer when
looking for a fraternity. A fraternity
can take.a big chunk out of your
school term allowance, so it only
makes sense to get your money’s
worth. All fraternities have
similarities, yet they are very
different inside and out.

This article is the ﬁrst in a series
of my “unbiased” tour of Pitt
aternities. I will be aided by
biased reports and information from
members of the various fraternities.

I started my tour with a leisurely
14-minute walk up Forbes Avenue
through CMU to Delta Sigma Chi.
Of the four houses I have visited
thus far, this place has the most
class. The house gets its class not
only from being 115 years old,
having a ﬁreplace in every room and
being formerly owned by the
Kaufrnanns, but by having modern
luxuries. These luxuries include a

fancy poolroom with shag carpeting .

on the walls, an airhockey room, a
dance room and a separate room for
the bar, made from bricks from the

“ﬂguiﬁeid wall at Forbes Field. The
downstairs is enormous, and
contains a number of things to keep
a college student occupied when not
studying.

On the ﬁrst ﬂoor, Delta Sigma Chi
has a small TV room, a kitchen, a
room for meetings, a side porch for
storage and a living room filled with
a piano and many impressive
trophies. It also has a small parking
lot and a large wooden porch, which

To Pitt Fraternities  

often has a “Party Tonight” sign on
it.

John Panizza, the fraternity’s
vice-president, explained that one
large advantage his fraternity holds
over the others is that it is
off-campus. “We avoid having
problems with neighbors, ” Panizza
explained. “We don't worry about
noise. We can build our ﬂoat on our
front- porch at two in the morning if
we want, or whatever.”

Panizza boasted that Delta Sigma
Chi’s ﬂoat has been the winner in
the Homecoming parade the past
six years in a row. More

importantly,_for the past six years I

Delta Sigma Chi has won the
Roberto Clemente award for
generating the most money for
charities. Last year, the fraternities
raised $23,000 for charities, and
Delta Sigma Chi put in $7,000 of
that total.

Of the 40 “brothers” in Delta
Sigma Chi, 26 live in the house.
About four do all their cooking
there; the rest have meal plans in
the Towers cafeterias. The
vice-president explained that his
fraternity participates in all intra-
murals and is considered a
‘ ‘perennial power’ ’ in most of them.

As for fees, Delta Sigma Chi is
cheap compared to similar Pitt
fraternities. It is not affiliated with
a national fraternity so no money is

, being channeled out to support one.

The only fraternity connected with it
is Delta Sigma Chi at Pitt-Johns-
town. Members pay membership
dues of $50 every term. Living in
the house costs another $300 per
term, a very reasonable rent for in
Oakland.

If the best aspect of Delta Sigma
Chi was its house and fees, then in
the opinion of John Cica, the best
aspect of Sigma Chi must be its
brothers. Cica, president of Sigma
Chi, deﬁnitely said his frat had the
best membership among Pitt
fraternities. “Our fraternity
includes many of the leaders on
campus,” Cica said. “We’ve had
University and IFC presidents, a
student of the year and many of the
bigger names in Pitt athletics.”

Currently, there are 67 members
of Sigma Chi, 13 of whom live at the
house on Bayard Street. Of those
13, about half do their own cooking

at the house, while the rest 'eat at
their apartments or in Pitt’s
cafeterias.

Sigma Chi, with its large
membership, and many ex-jocks,
also is a big name in Pitt
intramurals. Last year it won the
IFC football crown.

The national Sigma Chi regards
Pitt’s chapter one of the top in the
country, Cica pointed out.

“Because of our combined high
QPA’s and our donations to Wallace
Village (Sigma Chi raised money to

individual, but those who did are often provided with

help build a gym for exceptional
children in Colorado), we are high
on their list,” Cica said. “Our big
fund raising day is slated for
November 5, when wi will hold our
annual Derby Day for Children’s
Hospital.”

Sigma Chi’s house is a little
smaller than most, but it does have
a nice trophy and living room on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor. Downstairs is nothing
special: a bar, a poolroom and a
dance area with an elaborate stereo
system. Other than that, it is pretty
dingy.

Sigma Chi charges its members
$250 to live in the house. Other fees
include a $50 pledge fee, a $75
initiation fee and $118 worth of dues
per term. Fees go in part to the
national fraternity, for things such
as a national Sigma Chi magazine.

If the high point of Delta Sigma
Chi is its”house and Sigma chi its
members, then at Delta Tau Delta,
it must be the cook. John Finn,
president of Delta Tau Delta, ‘said,
“We have the best cook out of all
the fraternities.” Idon’t know how
much that says, for Delta Tau Delta
has the only cook among the_
fraternities. Nevertheless the
“brothers” there swore by her.

Twenty of the 42 members of
Delta Tau Delta live and eat in the

house, where they receive nine

meals per week: ﬁve lunches and
four dinners. Lunch is served from
11:30 a.m.—1 p.m. and dinner at
5:30 p.m. Once a month, all the
“brothers” come over to join the
“little sisters” for a big dinner.
Finn assured me that the food is
good and the portions big, as he
ate an omelet with mushroom.
Leftover food also can be consumed
by members for an extra fee. Finn
also pointed out that eating at the
house saves the time spent walking
to the Tower, and another member
added that “our nine meals are
better than their 19 anyway.”
Finn thinks Delta Tau Delta’s
alumni is a fraternity strong point.

Delta Tau Delta's house is
average size, with a large TV room
adjacent to a large dining room. The
kitchen has all the trimmings to suit
the cook. The basement contains a
large dance ﬂoor, a bar and a large
slate topped pool table and
Ping-Pong table.

The fees at Delta Tau Delta are
pretty steep. Room and board is
$600 per term; add to that a $100 fee
for joining and $154 for dues every
term.

Phi Beta Sigma, a Pitt fraternity

without any house, seems more
concerned with community projects
and brotherhood closeness than
anything else. Bruce Terrell, the

fratemity’s vice-president, explain-

ed some of the fraternity’s big’

events and drives. ‘ ‘Our big events
are our Sigma Week, in which we
raise money for the March of
Dimes. This year, it is the last week
in October and the ﬁrst week in
November. Our big social event is
our annual cabaret, which is‘ held in
January with our ‘Sigma Souls’
(little sisters).” ' ' A
Phi Beta Sigma was incorporated
in 1914 and has been on Pitt’s
campus since _1972. Currently,
Pitt’s chapter has 35 members.

Terrell said he joined Phi Beta
Sigma because of ideals shared with

other méiiibers and closeness of the .

“brothers. ’’

“We are involved in many
community projects, ’ ’ Terrell said.
“Some of our main ones are
tutoring for the YMCA, helping the
blind and helping in the community
food drive.”

Phi Beta Sigma is very big on the
intramural scene. Last year, they
captured the IF C basketball champ-
ionship.

Fees for Phi Beta Sigma
membership include an initiation
fee of $75 and yearly dues of $50;
$30 of this goes to the chapter and
$20 to the national fraternity. The
national fee covers items such as a
pin, a certiﬁcate and a national
magazine, “The Crescent.”

Next time, more fraternities.

So after weeks of long, sleepless‘

on a major. As your roommate
walks through the door, you joyfully
reveal your decision. But then your
roommate informs you Pitt dosn’t
offer your chosen major.

make a major,” said Susanna
Downie, the program's advisor.

A self-designed major is one of
the least known programs at Pitt. It
allows students to design and get a
degree in an area of study not
offered by the University.

“It can be very independent,”
said Downie,“and when a student
feels very restrained by the
Administration structure, a self-de-
signed major will help him get

Think Self-Dgesign

The program is most exciting for
students who are having problems
ﬁnding a major. Possibilities for
self-designed majors are numerous.

For example, students interested
in a journalism major can combine
writing, political science, sociology
and psychology courses. Speech
courses can be added for those
interested in broadcast journalism.

A more specialized type of
self-designed major combines soc-
ial and natural science for a degree
in wildlife management. Also, psy-
chology, sociology and education
courses can yield a degree in child
psychology.

How does

one about

g0

L formulating a self-designed major?
~ The ﬁrst step is for the student to

deﬁne his interest. The student
then must draw up a proposal
containing a course list, an
explanation of the major and
departmental clusters. The major’s

' focus should be in more than one

department.

Any student who submits a
proposal must have a faculty
sponsor. This sponsor serves as the
student’s major advisor.

“The student is responsible for

deﬁng his or her own interest, ” "

explained Downie, and then is

‘responsible for designing the

requirements to fullﬁll this major. ”
It is possible for the student to take

i courses independent of any depart-

ment. “A department, after all,
only has one perspective on its
subject,” Downie said. “Self-de-
signed majors are good for anyone
who wants to combine practical and
heoretical interests."

“Students should realize their
interests are legitimate,” Downie
said. ,“As- long as it has some
degree of coherency, any interest

Robin Trower Concert

Rock Buffs Leave Sa    

By JIMFARERI
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Civic Arena was surprisingly
packed last Friday night for a triple
bill of rock. Shaking the big silver
dome were RamJ am, Black Oak and
Robin Trower.

Disunited, these three entities
would have questionable drawing
power: RamJam is a novice band
with no prior exposure on a
Pittsburgh stage and Black Oak is
just a revitalized child of the
dubious Black Oak Arkansas. Even
Robin Trower, premier guitarist
that he is, has turned to forms of
music less salable to the typical
Arena crowd.

Well, it might have been that
good; big-name rock concerts have
been slim pickings in Pittsburgh of
late. In any case_, the Arena was at
no loss to provide the three bands
with a few thousand rock zealots
(the aﬁcionados up front counted for
two).

RamJ am set the pace for the
night when they opened up with
“It’s All For The Love Of
Rock’n’Ro1l.” The audience let this
band and the forthcoming acts know

Kurt Johnson, now playing the role
of Zach on Broadway, said, “The
show he is casting is ‘Chorus Line.‘
He starts off with one show in
mind, then creates a show as these
people talk to him.”
Two of these people are Kristine

and Diana. played by Debbie
Geffner and Loida Iglesias. respec-
tively.

The “Chorus Line” story is

unique. “It's a show for gypsies
who have cried since year one
about getting out of the chorus and
doing parts." said Johnson. “This
show enables them to do that. It’s
about them.”

The three actors described a

process of self-analysis. putting‘

one’s personality onstage and
developing a character from it.

“I came to New York when I was
16 to go to Juliard (dance school).“
Geffner said. “I wanted to be a
ballet dancer._ I didn't start acting
until years after that.” She is a
Pittsburgh native.

Geffner understudied the role of

£KAI;C«I"

Sheila, an aggressive,. strong
person who boasts of her maturity
and dislikes her age. Now she
plays Kristine, a loud, crazy
character, whose manic behavior is
augmented by a lack of. singing
ability.

“I tried out (for “Chorus Line”)
a couple times.” Geffner said. “I
didn't know anything about it when
it started. I tried out for the
replacement company and didn't
get that and then they called me
again and said. ‘Hey. would you
like to understudy Sheila?’

“I said sure and I came in.
Then. after a week of rehearsals.
they asked me ifl would like to try
out for Kristine. And they gave me
the part." added Geffner. who has
appeared in several New York and
road shows.

‘‘If I wasn't close to Kristine.
they wouldn't have asked me to try
out for the part." Geffner said.
“I’m goofy, I'm really ditsy
sometimes.

things I get away with. I get away
with a lot of things by being cute

and funny. I can relate to
Kristine's insecurity."
“At one point Bob Avian

show with us." Geffner said. “He
told us. ‘You were all typecast.

You were given these roles because

you are these people. So don’t

Loida Iglesias. who recently

returned to the United States after
performing in London. said. “They
want us to be ourselves. In a way
it's hard. because you have to sit
back and analyze yourself."

Iglesias portrays Diana. a charm-
ing. outgoing and religious Puerto
Rican. Diana’s story begins in the
high school of Performing Arts.
where she had an acting class
taught by an instructor who
despised her. Like many students.
she had to search within herself to
ﬁnd what she wanted after this bad
experience.

C-iincidentally. Iglesias had an

almost ‘identical incident.

“She (Diana) is me 100
percent,” Iglesias said. “The only
thing which is not me is what
happened with the acting hap-
pened to me in a dance
department. I also went to the
high school of the Performing Arts.

“With me, at an audition, I‘m
not the quiet one.” Iglesias
continued. “I’m not the one who
hides in a corner or goes behind the
line and tries to go unnoticed. I'm
always in front trying to do my
best. That's me as Loida. which is
what Diana is.”

As Black Oak went through songs

‘You Light Up My Life’

Made for T VMovie Plot

By JIM FARERI

You Light Up My Life
Directed by Joseph Brooks
Columbia Pictures

“You Light Up My Life” is a
90-minute movie that couldn’t hold
‘=«:;_. a light to most 90-minute
made-for-TV ﬁlms. Like a ﬁlm
created exclusively for the tube,
“You Light Up My Life” is
entertaining but unexceptional
fare.

The plot is the moral story of a
thousand novels written for teen-
aged girls; something that might
have been serialized in Seventeen.

A truly good girl falls head over
heels for a man with a slick, Mr.
Wonderful come-on. Of course, the
guy turns out to be a cad who
doesn’t care beans for anybody but
himself, the girl learns her lesson
and rides off into the sunset to find
happiness and fame.

J {EA Robinson (Didi Conn) is this

cute little brown-eyed girl: bright,
innocent and naive. The archetypal
picture of a girl waiting to discovei
that she must take charge of herself
if she is ever to get anything out of
life.

She wants to be a singer/song-
writer, much to the unconcern of her
too-fatherly father (Joe Silver), who
has made her perform a stale
ventriloquist act since she was a kid
and her ﬁance (Michael Zaslow), a
colorless, self-absorbed clod who
wants her to ‘shut up and go to
parties with him.

Lori meets the other man (Steven
Nathan) in a bar, and he instantly
charms her off to his apartment for
the night. A terminal farewell takes
place in the morning, but the man
soon pops up again, this time as the
director of a ﬁlm in which Lori
auditions for a voice-dub.

The man loves Lori’s voice (she
sings “You Light Up My Life”), and
apparantly Lori too, so much that he
asks her to star in his ﬁlm. They pal
around together and Lori soon ﬁnds
herself in love with him. She is so
sure the feeling is mutual that she
calls off her wedding plans and bids
her ﬁance goodbye.

Abruptly, the man shows his true
colors: he suddenly doesn’t want
Iori~around as his lover or his big
star. So Lori retreats to dad and the
old wooden dummy act, in front of
an audience of snotty, unapprecia-
tive kids.

Trower humbly smiled and opened
his set with a new song: “Falling
Star.”

Trower’s act was stationary. No
jumping or carousing around the
stage for the head axeman, his
vocalist or bass player. It
immediately was apparent that
Trower would have to excite with his
ﬁngers and fretboard if he was to
win the battle of the bands.

He did just that. While working a
variety of special effects pedals with
his foot, Trower took his guitar to
places that only he and the red
Fender can go. Bending his body
and contorting his face to his own
winning axework, he stunned the
audience with ﬁnesse and subtlety
—a commodity the opening acts
lacked.

Aiming to please the rock’n’roll
crowd, the band backstepped to
their rock days and played several
old, familiar numbers, including
their biggest hit, “Day Of The
Eagle.” Even the new songs—such
as “Smile” and “Somebody’s
Calling”-were cut with a special
rock edge. Trower came through,
still king of the mountain.

The audience left satisfied,
successfully wooed by both the
overt and subtle, the ﬂashy and
reﬁned.

She has her epiphany of
self—reliance, which sends her to
New York City, an independant
woman at last. There she puts “You
Light Up My Life” at the top of the
charts.

Didi Conn and Joe Silver give apt
performances. Conn has the perfect
face for her role; she could express
Lori’s ups and downs with her
visage alone. On the other hand,
Zaslow and Nathan are old and
predictable as the two men-but the
script demands for precisely that.

Joseph Brooks, the writer,
director and composer of “You
Light Up My Life,” is safe and
unoriginal. His simple, true,
slice-‘of-life ﬁlm has charm but lacks
force or durability. Brooks’s Barry
Manilowish songs, sung zestfully
by Conn, may be the most
memorable elements of the movie
as well as Brooks’s forte.

Against the scope and quality of
most Hollywood releases, this
picture is distinctively small and
unambitious. It will be forgotten as
surely as what it portrays is true and
banal. Didi Conn probably will be
remembered; Lori Robinson ‘is
already forgotten.

Rolling Stones Never Die

Pit! News Staff Writer

Rolling Stones
“Love You Live”
Rolling Stones Records

The Rolling Stones‘ have been
around for so long that many
people, other than their millions of
hard-core fans, find it difficult or
tedious to get excited over the band
anymore.

Let's face it, after 14 years, nearly
20 studio albums and all that time in
is quite

 arkable the Stones have kept
the creative juices ﬂowing for this
long.

However, their music always has
been good. Although people may

be sick of hearing about what they
mean to rock’n’ roll and how they
started it all, no one can deny the
Stones still produce quality music.

The Stones’ new album, a live
double record effort recorded in
Paris and a small club in Toronto,
the El Mocombo, is their third live
release in 14 years.

Their ﬁrst, recorded in London at
Royal Albert Hall and released in
1967, “Got Live If You Want It,”
was marred by lousy, tinny
production and sounds fuzzy
compared to other 1970 live
recordings. Their second, “Get Yer
Ya-Ya’s Out,”recorded at Madison
Square Garden on their infamous
yet brilliant 1969 American tour, is
considered by many critics to be the
finest live rock’n’ roll album ever.

“Love You Live” is unquestion-
ably better than the ﬁrst one, but
does not hit with the impact of “Get
Yer Ya-Ya’s Out.” The reason is
simple: In 1969, the Stories were
the rock’n’ roll band. Now, they are
one of the bands.

The album has many remarkable
elements. The sound is crisp, Andy
Warhol's cover design is stimula-
ting, and the music, primarily
rock’n’ roll, is absolutely the
raunchiest stuff to come down the
pike in years.

Since this is a Stones’ album, all
15 of the Mick Jagger-Keith

Richard compositions are well--

known. They include: “Brown

Sugar,” from 1971's “Sticky

Fingers;” “I-IaPP)’»" and “Tum-

Russian Music

Highlights Symph any‘

(Continued from Page 12)

effect was strangely soothing
rather than intense as would be
expected from a Russian concert.

Previn’s interpretation of Proko-
ﬁev’s Seventh Symphony mirrored
the conﬂicting feelings the com-
poser had about his work, but in
reverse order. Originally, Proko-
ﬁev conceived his seventh as a
“children’s symphony,” to be
performed and broadcast all over
the Soviet Union.

What started as a bright.
optimistic work soon became
melancholy. Just as the dirge is
about to wind down and end the
symphony, Prokoﬁev interrupts it
with a 13-measure coda ‘that
reminds one of the hunting music
from _“Peter and the Wolf.”

Previn cancelled these effects by
making the ﬁrst movement gran-
diose and epic and the other three
movements light and mischievous.

- The ﬁrst movement was the only

part of the concert in which the
orchestra was truly passionate,
especially the funeral cellos and
basses. Previn, as,most conduc-
tors, used the extended coda,
adding to the already airy
atmosphere.

Even in Rachmaninoff’s Third
Piano Concerto, written by a piano
virtuoso for his own use, conductor

c Previn was the star of the show.

Cuban pianist Horacio Gutierrez
was so involved in working out the
intricacies of the counterpoint that
he intellectualized his perfor-
mance, keeping his head bent
down over the score the entire
time. 4
Thus. the sound did not project
to the audience. and the soloist’s
demeanor was what one would
expect to see in a dark practice
room rather than in a live
performance. Gutierrez’s tempos
were too fast for both himself and
Previn. and the orchestra spent

more than half its energy trying tw g

keep pace with the soloist.

Some passages in the slow
second move'ment were subtle and
moving. but the technical difﬁcul-
ties generally prevented the
performance from displaying much
drama. In both the Rachmaninoff
concerto and the Prokoﬁev sym-
phony. the trumpets and percus-
sion seldom roseabove a whisper.

The audience responded more
favorably than it usually does to
all-Russian programs. Although
the Prokofiev work received only
one curtain call. it was a warm one.
As for the Rachmaninoff, Gutirrez
and Previn received four curtain

calls. but the audience stood only

when Previn and Gutierrez bowe
together; It seems that Andre
Previn just now is being loved and
appreciated by Pittsburghers.

1973’s ‘ ‘Goathead’s Soup; ” “If You
Can’t Rock Me,” “Fingerprint
File” and “It’s Only Rock’n’ Roll
from 1974’s “It’s Only Rock’n’

' R011?’

The album also includes “Hot
Stuff” from last year’s “Black and
Blue” and “Honky Tonk Woman,”

“Get Off Of My Cloud,” “You-
’Can’t Always Get What You

Want,” “Jumping Jack Flash” and
“Sympathy For the Devil,” all 60s
material contained on prior live
albums.

In addition, all of side three is
19505 cuts recorded at the El
Mocambo Club. H
“Love You Live” is, surprisingly, a
very tight album from a group of
musicians who tour as often as it
snows in Hawaii. The whole album
cooks with an invigorating sort of
steely intensity.

As usual, Jagger takes command
right off the bat with his sleazy
phrasing and sings offbeat improvi-
sations on lyrics, creating a nasal
and haughty vocal effect. .~

Although Jagger has been crude
in the past, on this album he sounds
like a houndog with sandpaper in
his throat. But, as usual, it Works to
perfection when combined with the
basic and snarling instrumentation
of his band.

The addition of Ron Wood, Face’s
ex-lead guitarist, to the Stones’ fold
also has inspired the mangy
Richards to get even meaner.

Since Wood, like Richards, is not
the greatest guitar virtuoso, he
mines his grinding runs and loose
but appropriate solos. This,
combined with Richards’ riveting
guitar rhythms, makes for one of the
nastiest guitar sections to be heard.

On “Happy,” “IfYou Can’t Rock
Me—Get Off Of My Cloud” and all
of side four (“lt’s Only Rock n’
Roll,” “Brown Sugar,” “Jumping
Jack Flash” and “Sympathy for the
Devil”) Richards and Wood beat
the daylights out of their guitars.

Drummer Charlie Watts, always
a tasty and . proﬁcient drummer,

sounds more energetic than he’s

ever been. Instead of polluting the
sound with useless rolls and cymbal
crashes, he propels the beat with
expert hi-hat work and subtle jazz
shadings, allowing the music to ki;

with a vengeance—but not bomb: ‘”

tically.

Perhaps the weakest link on the
album is side two. “Fingerprint
File” is an ambitious mood piece
that doesn’t quite strike home,
while ‘ ‘You Can’t Always Get What
You Want” cannot stand up to its
superb studio version.

Undoubtedly, the most intriguing
side is the third, recorded at the
small El_Mocambo club in Toronto,
an experimental date the Stones
tried as a change of pace from the
gargantuan stadiums and arenas
they are used to playing in.

After “Crackin’ Up,” Jagger
announces that he wants to “stroke
everybody in the audience,” 1 4
goes into the introduction of ‘l. e
band, adding a nice bit of humor.

“Ollie (percussionist Ollie
Brown) is too Charlie Watts,
maybe. Bill Wyman just wants to
take photos of all the girls’ legs.
Ronnie Wood is gay and Keith
Richards is straight.”

' Corny and showy, you ask? Yeah,
but that’s Jagger. Narcissistic but
humorous, with the crack about
Richards the most interesting and
revealing. .

The dark-haired and

rott -
toothed Richards may very welm g

in jail within the next few months if
convicted on charges of trafficking
in and possessing cocaine and
heroin.

If Richards, the heart of the
Stones, is put away for a number of
years, “Love You Live” could well
be the ﬁnal Rolling Stones album,
bringing an end to one of the most
incredible musical groups in the
history of entertainment.

That is, it could be.

But as New York street balladeer

Elliot Murphy said earlier this yea§‘J 

“If they put Keith Richards in jai

we'll just have to break him out."
Let's hope that for Richards’ sake,
and the sake of all Stones lovers, a
step this drastic need not take place.

t‘i°"°"vve didn't rush but three people
most of the day," Panther head
coach Jackie Sherrill of his game
plan. “That’s why we didn't really
get to the quarterback. Our game

' plan was to defend instead of rush. ’ ’

And it was that defense that
enabled Pitt (3-1) to post its ﬁrst 38
points. ' 7

Late in the ﬁrst quarter, Felder
intercepted a Smith pass in the end
zone, which stalled a Boston
College scoring threat deep in
Panther territory. Five plays and 80
yards later, Pitt notched six points
when freshman quarterback Rick
Trocano jaunted for a 3-yard
touchdown run. The Panthers led,
7-0.

About three minutes later in the
same quarter, Bob Jury tied a Pitt
record by intercepting his 14th
career pass (joining Carl DePasqua)
and returned it to the Eag1e’s
25-yard line. Elliot Walker began
another excellent rushing afternoon
with a 19-yard run, giving the
Panthers a 14-0 lead after one
stanza.

 

“We knew we could execute,”
Sherrill said of the potent Pitt
running attack, which garnered 260
yards in 39 attempts. “The ﬁrst
part of the game we started
running. They hadtrouble stopping
it.

“We felt we could run inside and

squash them down.”

Squash is the best adjective to
describe Green’s tackle of Boston
College punter Jim Walton, which
handed the Panthers the ball at the
Eagle 25-yard line and set up a
Trocano to Gordon Jones 13-yard
touchdown pass early in the second
quarter, giving Pitt 21-0 advantage.
After Walton fumbled the snap
from center, the massive Green
jumped to block the expected kick.

But instead, Walton tried run-
ning under the airborne mass, who
promptly wrapped his legs around
the scurrying punter and scissor-
tackled him. 1

Later it was Jeff Delaney who
picked a BC spiral out of the sky and
returned it to the Eagle 19-yard line.
Pitt had to settle for a ﬁeld goal, as
Dave Trout’s 44-yard try made it
through the uprights for a 24-0
Panther lead. .

Early in the second half, Boston
College came back to life,
recovering a Pitt fumble on the
41-yard line. Smith connected to
tight end Tim Sherwin for a 12-yard
touchdown toss, and the Eagles
vgere ﬂying with thoughs of a
comeback after cutting Pitt’s lead to
24-7.

But those thoughts were erased
very early in the fourth quarter.
After a Mike Balzer interception at
the Boston College 40-yard line,
Trocano scampered for 22 yards and
six points, his second touchdown
run of the afternoon.

game, “But I decided not to play
him no matter what.”

“The offense has taken up the
slack; when you lose a great college
player there usually is a great shock
to the team. But the offense has the

The Pitt volleyball team‘

its own invitational this weekend,
despite the loss of one of its key
players.

from New York who adds as much to
Pitt’s offensive attack with her
enthusiasm as she does with her
ﬁne setting, suffered a knee injury-
in the Pantherettes’ second match
Friday evening.

we extent of her injury and how

ng she will be out of action has not
yet been determined.

In her absence, Mary Savage and
Mary Lou Susang took over the
setting duties, instead of sharing
time at the second setting position.

The rest of the team pulled
together as the Pantherettes dusted
off Salisbury State College and the
University of Pennsylvania, 2-0, on
Friday night. Saturday morning,
Pitt defeated Brockport 2-1 to

Georgetown, much-improved o-

a struggle in the semi-ﬁnals.

However, the Pantherettes pro-
ved no match for Temple in the
ﬁnals, as the Owls captured two
straight games, 15-10 and _lS-9, to
win the contest and capture the
tournament.

“Temple was the best team in the x

tournament,” said Hebert, “and I
believe we were the second best.
Temple played very well, especially
in their serving game. They just
intimidated us.”

Although the Pantherettes ﬁn-
ished second in a ﬁeld of 16, Hebert
noted his disappointment. “We
have so much talent on this team
that we should have done better,”
he said. “I don’t know if we could

The Pitt soccer team, which has
acquired a _ potent offense this
season, could only muster a
penalty-shot goal with one minute
remaining in Friday night’s 3-1 loss
to national-power Temple.

“‘You have to get more than one
1 goal against teams of Temple's
caliber,” Pitt head coach Leo Bemis
said. ‘Temple has most of a ﬁne
team b ck from last year’s
undefeate ajor college team and,
although they lost some good
players due to graduation, they are
a strong squad.”

The Owls scored their three goals
early in the ﬁrst half, then hung on
until Pitt’s John O'Hara blasted a
short past the Temple netminder
with seconds left  the contest.
O'Hara, a freshman, tied for the
goal-scoring lead with teammates
Marty Moyer and Bob Hughs at
three.

“This year, we’re counting on
freshmen and sophomores with only
Pitt experience,” Bemis stated. “If
Temple hadn't scored the ﬁrst goal
as early as they did-the way they
did--it would have been a 1-0
nothing-type contest.”

Three mistakes led the way to the
Owl barrage, which proved costly.

“We played well after those ﬁrst
three goals,” Bemis said. “The

Steelers Blast Browns

CLEVELAND (AP)-—Pittsburgh
quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw
three touchdown passes, two to
Lynn Swann, and ran for another as
the Steelers took advantage of
numerous Cleveland errors to beat

 previously undefeated Browns

28-14 in a National Football League '

game yesterday.

The Steelers, 2-1, went into the
lead for good on a 14-yard Bradshaw
to Swann pass early in the third
period-, moving the ﬁnal 18 yards
following a fumbled punt by
C1eveland’s Reggie Craig. Swann
had a career high of seven
receptions in the game.

Pittsburgh, which sputtered
much of the ﬁrst half, went into
halftime tied at 14-14, thanks to a
6-yard scoring toss to Swann and a
65-yard bomb from Bradshaw to
Frank Lewis on which Cleveland
rookie cornerback Oliver Davis saw

in th_c$‘all bounce off his chest into the

receiver’s arms. Lewis went the
ﬁnal 20 yards untouched.

The Steelers put the game out of
reach early in the fourth period as -
Browns running star Greg Pruitt
fumbled at Cle'veland’s 45 and the
ball was recovered by Steeler
cornerback Jim Allen. Rocky Bleier
ripped off 17 yards in three plays,
Bradshaw connected with Swann
for 14 yards to the Cleveland 11 and
the Steelers scored ﬁve plays later
on Bradshaw's dive from the one,
making it 28-14.

The Browns, 2-1, came right back
with a drive from their own 22, but
regular quarterback Brian Sipe
suffered an apparent shoulder
injury and was removed from the
game as Cleveland gained a ﬁrst
down at the Pittsbrugh 32.

Replacement David Mays threw
on first down and the ball was
intercepted by Pittsburgh comer-
back Mel Blount.

Panther Duflers conclude
Fall Season Willi Toumeys

By JIM PANE

‘Pitt News Staff Writer

A highly improved Pitt golf team
will conclude its fall schedule with
multi-team tournaments today and
tomorrow.

Coming off of a l0th-place ﬁnish
at the sixth annual Pitt Invitational
I V gépt. 23, coach Steve Petro’s

anthers enter today’s match at
California State and tomorrow’s
endeavor at Meadville playing
“much better golf than they did last
fall.’’

“I’d say the team is averaging 20
to 25 strokes better this year than in
last season's matches,” Petro said.
“Last year, we were lucky if we
broke 400, but this year we seemed
to be able to shoot below 400 more
often.”

Pitt has consistently tallied scores
of 390 (by adding the squad’s top

‘score cards) this fall, including

A  94 that placed 10th behind
Indiana’s 355 in the Pitt tourney.

The Panthers’ remaining perform-

ances were a fourth-place 390 at

Youngstown and 393 that was good

enough for the seventh position in:
the St. Vincent tournament.

Petro credited this season's
success to the fact that his top four
scorers have been able to contribute.
70-stroke rounds, although they
haven't always been the same
performers.

The only consistent shooters have
been Bob Curey and Dew Boyle,

according to Petro, but the
number-three and four players have
been ,,able to compliment the top
perfofmers with consistent rounds
of 70.

...Curey, Boyle and Jim McGrath,
who shot 74, 78 and 80,
respectively, in the Pitt invite, have
vied throughout the fall for the top
three Panther slots while Alan
English, Larry Smore and Kevin
McCarthy have contended for the
fourth spot. ,

Many of the teams hosted by the
Panthers in their tournament,
including winner Indiana and
powers such as Edinboro, Slippery
Rock and Penn State, will make an
appearance in Pitt’s ﬁnal two
contests.

Pittsburgh’s ﬁrst score. in the
ﬁrst quarter, was set up by a
31-yard punt return by Swann to
Cleveland's 25. The Steelers moved
in for the score in ﬁve plays.

Cleveland powered back to tie it,
going 64 yards in 10 plays with Sipe
completing the drive on a 22-yard
scoring pass to Dave Logan with 22
seconds left in the period. That was
the ﬁrst time an opponent had
scored a ﬁrst-period touchdown
against the Steelers in 32 regular
season games. ’

Pittsburgh defensive back J. T.
Thomas intercepted a Sipe pass
near-midﬁeld early in the second,
but defensive tackle Mike St. Clair
tipped a Bradshaw pass into the
arms of Cleveland linebacker
Gerald Irons seconds later, with
Irons returning the ball 33 yards to
the Pittsburgh ﬁve. Cleo Miller
went over from the one as Cleveland
tood a 14-7 lead.

Pittsburgh tied it almost im-
mediately as Bradshaw combined
with ewis for the long bomb on the
second play after the kickoff.

A Pittsburgh drive late in the half
ended as Cleveland held on fourth
and one at their own 40, with 18
seconds left.

ByJOHNFEYDO

As the baseball playoffs com-
mand the spotlight of the sports

‘ world this week, it is time to stop

and take a good look at the Los
Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia
Phillies, National League division
winne.s who begin their post-sea-
son series tomorrow.

This is the second consecutive
playoff year for the Phils, who
seemingly have replaced the Pirates
as the NL East's annual playoff
representative. Last year the
Phillies were thrashed ‘three
straight games by the powerful
Cincinnati Reds. For the Dodgers,
this is the ﬁrst playoff since 1974,
when they eliminated the Pirates in
four games before falling victim to
the then-mighty Oakland Athletics
in a ﬁve-game World Series.

The Dogers and Phils appear
evenly matched. Both clubs feature
a strong hitting attack and’ an
excellent bench. The Dodgers have
better overall starting pitching, but
th Phils own a stronger bull en.

 

Both clubs are solid defensively
and a threat to run on the
basepaths. The Phillies tend to run
a little more than the Dodgers,
having stoler nearly 140 bases to
L.A.’s 110, bu. will have to contend
with the strong arm of Dodger
receiver Steve Yeager in the
playoffs.

A position-by-position comparison:

FIRST BASE. L.A.’s Steve
Garvey, an annual Golden Glove
winner, enjoyed another ﬁne season
offensively as well. He knocked in
115 runs and ﬁnished as a .300 hitter
after a lengthy slump.

Rickie Hebner hit .286 for the
Phils and knocked in 62 runs, while
platooning with Dave Johnson
much of the year. Johnson provided
a good RBI bat when he got an
opportunity to play.

The edge goes to L.A. at ﬁrst
base.

SECOND BASE. Both clubs have
solid, scrappy veterans operating at

second. Philly’s Ted Sizemore and

L.A.’s Da

 
 

Lope both hit in the

Outland Trophy candidate Randy Holloway (70) stops a Boston College running
back. This was one of many plays that enabled Pitt to hold the highly-offensive

Eagles to only one touchdown last Saturday.

.280’s and both play an excellent
second base. Lopesled the Dodgers
with 45 stolen bases.

A very slight edge here to the
Dodgers.

THIRD BASE. Powerful Mike
Schmidt knocked in over 100 runs for
the Phils, while reminding people of
Brooks Robinson with his play at
third. Schmidt also smacked 38
homers. The Dodgers’ Ron Cey
tailed off badly after a strong start
and saw his average plung to .241 in
the ﬁnal week. Cey did knock in 110
runs though, and is adequate at
third defensively.

An edge here to Philly.

SHORTSTOP. Again, both clubs
are strong here. Larry Bowa of the
Phils has to get the nod over L.A.’s
Bill Russell on defense, but Russell
carries a stronger stick to the plate.
Bowa also swiped 32 bases.

This one is too close to pick, so
call shortstop even.

LEFT FIELD. The Phil’s Greg
Luzinski is a strong candidate for NL
Most Valuable Player honors.
“Bull” drove home 130 runs and hit
.310 to pace the Philly attack all
year. In L.A., Dusty Baker enjoyed
a ﬁne comeback season hitting .290
with 85 RBIs, but is no match for
Luzinski.

Edge to Philadelphia.

CENTER FIELD. The Dodgers’
only real weak spot. Rick Monday,
acquired from the Cubs last winter,
came up with a bad back and
suffered through his worst season.
Missing over 40 games, Monday hit
only.233 and drove in 48 runs. If
Monday can’t go, L.A. skipper Tom
Lasorda will, with either young
Glenn Burke (.252) or ageless Vic
Davalillo (.324) in center. The
Philies have Garry Maddox, one of
the best on defense. Maddox had 74
RBIs, stole 22 bases and hit .291
while performing with a series of

nagging injuries most of the season. ‘

A deﬁnite edge here to Philadel-
phia

RIGHT FIELD. Bake McBride
became the regular Phillie right-

ﬁelder after being acquired from St.
Louis in June, displacing Jay

Johnstone. McBride enjoyed a ﬁne

year hitting .315 with 38 steals and
60 RBIs. Phillie manager Danny

respected around the league.

Give the edge to L.A. in right.

CATCHER. Bob Boone handles’

most of the Philly catching chores,
but Tim McCarver dons the
catching gear when mound ace
Steve Carlton takes the hill for the
Phils. Boone hit .287 with 66 RBIs
while McCarver stung the ball at a
.323 clip.
Yeager hit .258 with 55 RBIs and
is well-respected for his strong arm.
A surprising fact, though, is that
Yeager led all NL catchers in errors
this year.
An edge to Philadelphia.
STARTING PITCHING. Deﬁn-
itely the Dodgers’ strong point,
Lasorda can send bionic lefty
Tommy John (20-7, 2.78 earned run
average) and righthander Don
Sutton (14-8, 3.19) at the Phils in the
first two games and‘still have his
choice among knuckle-curveball
specialist Burt Hooten (l1—7, 2.58),
lefty Doug Rau (14-8, 3.44) and
righthander Rick Rhoden (16-10,
3.75) as starter, for game three.
The Philly staff is headed by
Steve Carlton (23-10 2.64), a strong
Cy Young Award candidate. Carlton
has carried the load for Ozark all
year and is being counted on heavily
in the play offs.  Veteran Jim
[onborg probably will get the game
two assignment for Philadelphia.
I.onborg was 11-4, 4.10, after missing
all of April with an arm problem.
Young righthander Larry Christen-
son (18-6, 4.12) enjoyed a strong
second half for the _Phi1s and will

Phillies, Dodgers Vie For NL Title 

likely start game three. After these
three, things really drop off sharply
as veteran lefty Jim Kaat (6-11, 5.41)
and rookie lefty Randy Lerch (10-6,
5.15) are shaky at best.
The edge to Los Angeles.

BULLPEN. This is a Philly strong
suit, with Ron Reed (7-5, 2.41, 15
saves), Gene Garber (8-6, 2.44, 16
saves) and Tug McGraw (7-3, 2.31,
eight saves) all capable of putting
out the ﬁre for Ozark and the Phils.
Los Angeles has ‘knuckleballing

Charlie Hough (5-11, 3.58, 21 saves). a.

but he slumped horribly over the.-
ﬁnal three months of the season.
Lasorda can also call on righthand-
ers Mike Garman (4-4, 2.90, 10
saves) and Elias Sosa (-2, 2.07).
» An edge here to the Phils.

BENCH. The Dodgers feature
such ageless wonders as Manny
Mota (.394) and Davalillo (324).
Also available to Lasorda are
utilitymen Lee Lacy (.267) and
veteran catchers Jerry Grote (.258)
and Johnny Oates (.273).

The Phils also .can call on
Johnstone, McCarver and Johnson,
three of the best henchmen in

baseball. In addition, Ozark hasf by
outﬁleder Jerry Martin (.257) aii‘d

handymen Tommy Hutton (.257),
Ollie Brown (.246), Terry Harmon
(.208) and catcher Barry Foote.

An edge to Philadelphia.

SUMMARY. The Dodgers have
better all-around pitching, as can be
seen by looking at their league--
leading team ERA of 3.21. Philly
hurlers managed an ERA of 3.70,
third-best in the NL. Both clubs can
be devastating offensively and have
power spread throughtout their
lineups, so anything can happen in
the best of ﬁve series.
