University of Pittsburgh

Monday, February 13, 1995

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

In March 1994 Dr. Bernard
Fisher was forced out of a
national research project head-
quartered at the University of
Pittsburgh. ’

After serving as chair and
principal investigator of the
National Surgical Adjuvant
Breast and Bowel Project for 27
years and being one of the
founding members in 1958,
Fisher was out because of falsiﬁ-

cations of data at St. Luc’s

Hospital in Montreal, one of 500
NSABP centers.

Fisher told his story and relat-
ed it to breaches of academic
freedom at a University Senate-
sponsored lecture Thursday
afternoon.

“How I really dowish that I
was here today presenting infor-
mation indicating that we just
discovered a way to cure or pre-
vent the occurrence of breast
cancer in all women  Instead
I’m here with a profound feeling
of sadness with disbelief,” said
Fisher. “During the past year,
events took place which are best
described as an earthquake.
Suddenly the earth rumbles and
all the buildings carefully con-
structed over many years come
tumbling down.”

He said the media described
what they thought had happened
or “more appropriately was told
what to think took place.”

“Lives were destroyed, breast
cancer research was put in disar-
ray. Women of this country were
panicked or were told by the
media that they should panic,”
said Fisher.

“The story with many convo-
luted twists and turns began to
unfold. A story-so complex that
only by living it could one have

Fraternity brothers and police
officers got together last week
and talked about some tense
topics —— sexual assault and
underage drinking.

The Department of Public
Safety sponsored a security
seminar last Thursday that was
open to the entire university, and
unlike past seminars, this one
was heavily attended, almost
exclusively by fraternity broth-
ers and sorority sisters.

The first topic discussed and
debated was alcohol and the
laws surrounding it. Jerry

Union rallies against cutbacks

By Jackie Duggan
For The Pitt News

District ll99P is“ part of the Service Employees

How to provide quality patient care when a facili-
ty drastically cuts its staff is the question union
members of District ll99P want the University of
Pittsburgh Medical ‘Center administration to

answer.

“We have conﬂicting visions of health care,” said
John Borsos, president of District ll99P, “one dri-
ven by quality and the other by cost.”

In response to the cutbacks, Sid Seligman, direc-
tor of Human Resources for UPMC, said, “The
quality of care is as it always has been.”

Seligman also said WPIC is considered to be a

International Union. It represents a variety of the

UPMC’s maintenance and service employees.

Along with their concern for the quality of patient
care, they are negotiating with UPMC because their
union contract ended on Feb. 3 and, according to
Borsos, the two-sides are “miles apart” from agree-

ing to the new contract conditions UPMC has pro-

posed.

premier psychiatric facility throughout the world. .

Seminar Thursda focused
on assault and CI cohol

was the speaker. _

“If you get cited by police for
underage drinking, it’s a non-
criminal offense, but there is a
fine, and your driver’s license
will be suspended for 90 days,”
Farmer said.

In practice, however, when an
individual gets caught drinking
underage, the penalty is not usu-
ally that stiff. Farmer said
Pittsburgh city magistrates have
the right to delegate their own
penalties and sometimes dri-
ver’s licenses are not suspended.

Farmer cautioned the students
that underage drinking citations,
while they won’t be on a perma-
nent criminal record, do over-
lap, and penalties can become
stiffer.

°Seminar, page 4

“They want to throw away everything our mem-
bers have fought 20 years to establish,” said Borsos.
Some of the changes UPMC has proposed
include a wage freeze, elimination of the union’s
health and welfare fund, elimination of the union’s
pension and elimination of set schedules. ’

Dangers of binge drinkin
discussed at forum Satur ay

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

When approximately 150
Greeks were asked if they had
binged on alcohol within the last
two weeks, the answer was vir-
tually a unanimous yes.

Many Greeks spent their
Saturday afternoon learning
about the dangers of binge
drinking and guidelines for alco-
hol safety.

Dr. Michael Finley, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon’s chair of
Medicine Health Services,
police officer Eric Rustad and
Shirley Haberman of Pitt’s
Student Health Services came
together to teach students about
the risks involved in heavy
drinking.

“Drinking is not bad per se,
but when you do too much of it,
it can be a real problem,” Finley
said. He defined binge drinking
as consumingfive or more
drinks on one occasion for men,
or four or more drinks for
women.

To show alcohol’s effects on
the body visually, four Pitt
Greeks spent two hours drinking
at the Attic before the presenta-
tion. Each student went through
a series of highway sobriety
tests administered by Rustad.

Among other tests, the stu-
dents had to walk a straight line
heel to toe while counting to
eight, follow a pen waved from
side to side with their eyes,
touch their fingers to their noses

LONDON — Children with
asthma or other breathing prob-
lems should put their teddy bears
in the freezer for 24 hours before
taking them to bed, British
experts announced on Friday.

The cold will kill the dust mites
which live on cuddly toys, car-
pets, curtains and bedding and
can trigger asthma attacks, the
experts said.

Teddy bears should also be
washed after freezing to get rid of
the dead mites and the freezing
process should be done once a
week, according to Dr. Jill
Warner of Southampton
University’s Depar1:rnent of Child
Health. — Reuters

KARACHI, Pakistan — An
Islamic group, angered by the
extradition of an alleged bomb-
plotter to the United States,
demanded on Sunday that pop

stars Michael Jackson and.

Madonna, and writers Salman
Rushdie and Tasleema Nasrin be
extradited to Pakistan.

Ghafoor Ahmed, deputy leader
of the right—wing Jamaat—e-
Islami, told Reuters that the
United States has been acting like
a colonial power.

Ahmed said Madonna and
Jackson should stand trial for
“spreading obscenity,” while
Rushdie and Nasrin were wanted

for blasphemy. — Reuters

BANGKOK, Thailand —
Thailand’s Health Ministry said
Friday that 30 heroin addicts will
voluntarily begin taking a vac-
cine this month to test whether it
could guard against AIDS.

Thai Health Minister Arthit
Urairat said the injection of chim-
panzees with the vaccine had
established immunity without
suffering side effects. Some Thai
news reports stated that the
United States had stopped
advanced testing of the vaccine
on safety grounds. — Reuters

NEW YORK — Highly paid
government informants have
gained increasing control over
their handlers, and the laws to
control the use of snitches are
often flouted, according to a

_ study released today.

The study released by the
National law Journal ‘concludes
that “law enforcement’s reliance
on informants has grown to
almost Orwellian proportions as
snitches exert growing control
over agents and judges fail to
impose any checks or balances.”

The journal reports that the
most abuses by informants and
law enforcement officials stem
from the country’s war on drugs
and that mandatory sentencing
laws with long prison terms have

created more incentives for crim-
inals to avoid jail at any cost. -

WASHINGTON — Leon
Panetta, White House chief of
staff, said yesterday that President
Clinton enthusiastically supports
his nominee for surgeon general.

Panetta, on “Meet the Press,”
said the Senate should weigh the
38-year medical career of the
nominee, Dr. Hemy Foster, and
not just the politically sensitive
issue of his abortion record.

When asked whether the White
House would accept Foster’s
withdrawal if he volunteered it,
Panetta said that based on a
recent conversation with the
nominee, Foster will ﬁght until
the end. —— Reuters

WALESKA, Ga. — House
Speaker Newt Gingrich gave his
solution on Saturday on how to
end the baseball strike.

Gingrich suggested that the
strike be resolved by the players *

and owners going to an isolated
retreat, praying and watching the
film Field of Dreams to rediscov-
er the sport’s spirit of coopera-
tion.

The Speaker blamed the six-
month deadlock of Major League
Baseball on the lawyers who rep-
resent each side instead of the
players and owners meeting
themselves. — Reuters

Pilt's annual "Scouting for Food" still taking donations

By Linda Wisniewski
Staff Writer

For Pitt students and faculty,
there are still three more days to
help feed the less fortunate in
our community.

The University of
Pittsburgh’s annual “Scouting
for Food” drive is in full swing,
and this year’s activities will be
launched with a raffle.

“It’s usually geared toward
staff and faculty,” said Karrie

dent activities.

annual event at. Pitt since 1987,
and this year’s drive is directed

given a Breathalyzer test, and
two of them registered above

ly drunk in Pennsylvania.
Rustad also explained the
penalties for various alcohol-
related offenses. Underage
drinking is a summary offense
which results in a 90-day dri-
ver’s license suspension for the
first offense and a one—year sus-
pension for the second offense,
Rustad said. Supplying minors
with alcohol and making fake
IDs are misdemeanors which
result in a jail sentence and a
fine of $1,000 for the first
offense and $2,500 for the sec-
ond offense. Driving Under the
Influence is also a misdemeanor
and results in a two-day jail sen-

tence, at least $300 in ﬁnes, and ‘

possible loss of a driver’s
license.

Othenconsequences of drink-
ing such as unwanted,
unplanned and unprotected sex
were also discussed.

Valauri said students will be
able to trade one can of food
per rafﬂe ticket at the William
Pitt Union Ticket Office until
this Wednesday.

“There’s no limit,” she said.
“The idea is to feed the hungry
in Pittsburgh. I’m not going to
put a limit on it.”

Valauri said students will be
required to show their ID in
order to obtain a raffle ticket.

The drawing will be held this
Thursday, Feb. 16, at 3 p.m. in
the Ballroom of the William Pitt

Union, and is for two free all-'

Seven Springs Ski Resort and a
$50 gift certificate to the
University Book Store.

Students are not required to
be present at the drawing in
order to win.

Valauri said all of the food
collected will be given to the
Pittsburgh Food Bank.

Valauri said the university
will be hosting a number of

other activities for the

Seminar
°From page 1
Another concern for Greeks at

' the seminar was the rules behind

“raids” of fraternity house par-

A ties.

Farmer explained that the
BLCE needs probable cause to
enter a house where suspected
illegal activities are going on.

“I’m a constitutionalist,”
Farmer said. “I believe you have
rights, but if we think we should
be in we’ll be in.”

Farmer said the best thing an
underage drinker could do if
confronted by an officer is to be
cooperative and realize that the
officer is only doing his or her
job.

‘‘If you cooperate, it’s possible
the officer can write that on the
citation, and the magistrate will
be aware of it,” Farmer said.

Public'Safety Director Rick
Boyd was the moderator for the
seminar, and he answered some
students’ concerns.

"‘A great amount of interest
has been expressed by the uni-
versity to make an impact on

alcohol consumption,” Boyd
said. “The Public Safety
Department will take a more
pro-active approach in regard to
parties [at Pitt].”

Boyd said there are discus-
sions going on that might enable
Public Safety officers to patrol a
larger area of Oakland, includ-
ing the fraternity houses on
Dithridge Street.

Mary Koch Ruiz, the Sexual
Assault Services Coordinator,
spoke at the seminar about what
her job entails and what her
office provides.

Ruiz said she wants to dispel
some myths students have about
sexual assault. Along with writ-
ing a column in The Pitt News
once a month, Ruiz said she will

work with anyone on the Pitt_

campus to bring out sexual
assault awareness.

“I am trying to dispel some of
the myths with working with the
Public Safety Department,”
Ruiz said.

Speaking on the services she
provides for students who are

victims of an assault, Ruiz
emphasized that everything she
does is totally confidential.
She said she will tell no one,
including the victim’s parents,
unless it is all right with the vic-
tirn.

“I will work with faculty if
workload becomes a problem
for a victim, [and] I will work
with the Office of Residence
Life if living arrangements
become difficult,” Ruiz said.

Sometimes, Ruiz said, an
alleged attacker lives on the
floor of the victim, possibly
making it hard for the victim to
live there. ‘

Besides working individually
with students, Ruiz is trying to
make the Pitt community more

aware of sexual assault.

“I’m trying to implement a
sexual assault awareness week,
and peer education programs
have already begun,” she said.

Ruiz pointed out the disparity
between reported sexual assaults
for different schools. In 1994,
Pitt reported 13 sexual assaults.

The University of Iowa, with a
total student population of
27,000, reported 144 sexual
assaults for 1994.

Ruiz, Farmer and Boyd
echoed similar theories to these
potentially dangerous situations
throughout the seminar. When
dealing with alcohol situations,
Pitt students must be responsible
for one another.

Boyd responded to one stu-
dent’s complaint that Van Call
sometimes does not take people
home when they are drunk.

“Sometimes these [drunk] stu-
dents can become verbally abu-
sive to the bus drivers,” Boyd
said. “If he’s your buddy, you
should see to it that he gets
home safely, even if that means
calling a cab, riding home with
him and then riding back.”

Associate Director of Public
Safety Gary Moses pointed out
that Van Call was designed orig-
inally for students who study or
work late on campus and need a
ride home, not for students to go
home from parties.

 

Drinking

cited heterosexual women as
the group most at risk to con-
tract HIV through unprotected
sex.

Injuries and crime are also
consequences of drinking.
“Ninety percent of crime on
campus is alcohol-related,”
Finley said.

Haberman and Finley handed
out fact sheets with binge drink-
ing statistics and information
about what to do in an alcohol-
related emergency situation.

“If a close friend is in an
emergency situation, we want
you to do the right thing,”
Haberman said. “Brothers help-

ing brothers and sisters helping .

sisters — that’s what it’s about
here.”

Haberman also emphasized
that females should never feel
like they need to compete with
men in drinking.

“Women have more body fat
and can’t handle as much'alco-
hol because they have less
water [in their bodies] to dilute
it,” she said. She warned

women who drink with men _

that, “Go toe to toe with a man
A and you’ll lose every time.”

Of all the changes, union
members feel it is the cutbacks in
staff at WPIC that concern them
the most.

“The work is really overloaded
at this time,” said Pat Huwalt, a
project manager at WPIC for 11
years. “We were short staffed
even before they had cutbacks.
Now we are expected to do even
more work with less people.”

Huwalt said many employees
have been dropped to part-time
but are constantly asked to work
overtime.

“A lot of people are really
stressed out,” said Huwalt. “They
want to work you till you just
about drop.” .

Jim Aigner, a six-year mainte-
nance employee, said he typical-
ly works seven days a week and
puts in between 130 to 140 hours
per pay.

‘They have asked me to put in
overtime every day for the past
14 days,” said Aigner.

According to Aigner, the

amount of work he is asked to do
is not manageable — he is
expected to clean about 100 to
120 rooms per night. Before the
cutbacks he was cleaning 40
rooms at the most.
' “We don’t even do the project
work anymore, like washing
windows and cleaning floors,”
said Huwalt. “We don’t have the
time or personnel to do it.”

Huwalt said they were told to
clean on an “as needed” basis.

“I don’t even like going on the

-patient floors because the smell is

so bad,” he said.

Barbara Witherspoon was a
patient at WPIC for 74 days and
said her room was only cleaned
twice. “I had to beg people to
come and-clean my bathroom
and change my bed sheets,” said
Witherspoon. ‘

The cutbacks are also affecting
the nursing staff at WPIC. Marc
Winters, a representative of the

Jersey Economic Security

Organization (to which all staff
nurses belong), said since the cut-
backs began in July, approxi-
mately 80 nurses have been laid
off.

“They have replaced our laid
off nurses with assistant nurse
clinical managers,” said Winters.

By doing this, Winters and the
nurses said, UPMC is trying to
“erode the bargaining unit.” The
administration nurses that replace
the union bargaining staff nurses
won’t speak out against the cut-
backs because they do not have
job security, according to
Winters. I

Last summer the nurses held
an election to switch unions,
because they were unhappy with
the way the Pennsylvania Nurses
Association was responding to
their needs. JNESCO won the
vote, but \V1nters said UPMC has
been spending hundreds of thou-

sands of dollars to fight the certi- -

ﬁcation of JNESCO because it is
a bargaining union.

“Morale is very low among the
nurses,” said Joanne Shissler,

, APARTMENT -AVLE
IN THE OAKLAND AREA

secretary of the local JNESCO
union and a staff nurse at WIPC
for 12 years. “You can’t find a
staff nurse who is happy.”

Shissler said this is because
with the cutbacks, nurses are also
being asked to perform too many
tasks.

On a shift, in addition to pro-
viding patient care, she is kept
busy doing admissions, dis-
charges and distributing medica-
tion. Before the cutbacks there
were ﬁve persons per shift for a
unit. Now, she said, there are two
nurses and two other people.
These other people range from
student nurses to psychiatric
assistants and other unlicensed
personnel.

Shissler said many nurses have
gone from full-time to part-time
and have been switched to differ-
ent units that are not their special-
ty. She said it is difficult for nurs-
es trying to-survive financially,
because they can’t get another
part-time job to make a full-time
income, because they never
know what shifts they will be
scheduled to work.

Shissler said there have been
times when.she has worked from
7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and then been
called in 11 hours later to do itall
over again.

“UPMC’s attitude is, if you
don’t like it, leave,” said Shissler.
“Why should I be forced to leave
work that I love after I have
invested this many years of my
life in developing my specialty
and gaining seniority?”

An investigation was carried
out to determine whether it was
just a discrepancy or fraud, since
all of the forms were in French.

“There was an investigation
with visits by the NSABP staff to
St. Luc’s reviewing charts and so
on until it was determined with
the satisfaction of all that, yes,
there were falsiﬁcations of data,”
said Fisher.

According to Fisher, he was
informed of data falsification in
February 1991 and informed the
National Cancer Institute, who
funds the NSABP, within 24
hours. Once the Office of
Scientific Integrity was notified,
it put an embargo on the NSABP.

“We were not permitted to
speak about this to anyone,
except on a need-to-know basis,”
said Fisher.

While the Office of Research
Integrity and NSABP staffs con-
ducted a thorough audit on St.

- Luc’s, Dr. Carol Redmond, for-

‘.7_fT."¥v8! C‘i?2d:=.r>..=rr'-\

mer director of the NSABP
Biostatistical Center, and her staff
were analyzing data without St.

Luc’s infonnation.
There was no change in out-

2 come with or without St. Luc’s

data.

Fisher said in March 1992 the
NSABP reported a reanalysis at
the request of the ORI, NCI and
other government agencies.
“T hey had a sense of relief when
they discovered there was no dif-
ference in the end results,” he
said.

“Then, the ORI reports came
out. It was over two years that the
ORI took to investigate an affair,
which we had already told them
on day one existed, that there
were falsif1cations.”

According to Fisher, the
NSABP did not commit any fal-
sifications. “We discovered the
falsiﬁcations, we reported the fal-
sifications.

“Suddenly in 1994, all hell
broke loose,” he said.

A Chicago Tribune article,
printed March 13, revealed the
data falsifications.

The week of March 21, Fisher
said, the most mystifying and
unbelievable things began to

occur at the NSABP headquar-

. ters.

Several key NSABP staff
members were sent to New
Orleans to examine data at cen-
ters at Louisiana State University
and Tulane University. The fax
machine was running constantly
requesting answers, and NCI
auditors showed up at Pitt to
investigate the headquarters and
materials.

“They wanted information
about ﬁnances, personal. informa-
tion about honoraria. They went
through all of our ﬁles. We were
told to publish our reanalysis
paper immediately. And this was
just a horrible set of circum-
stances,” Fisher said.

On March 28 at 4:40 p.m.,
NCI officials called Fisher. His
university-appointed lawyer was
out of the office, so he did not
speak with them. Five minutes
later they called back demanding
he talk.

In a frantic voice, the official
said Fisher could not retain lead-
ership at the NSABP, for another '
incident of falsification in a

Montreal hospital had been dis-
covered. According to Fisher, the
official said it would bring down
the whole structure of clinical
research in North America, and
Fisher had to go.

Marty Michaelson, Fisher’s
university-appointed lawyer, then
called Fisher and told him that
John Dingell, chair of a
Congressional subcommittee,
was after the NCI and that if they
got rid of Fisher, it would get
Dingell off NCI’s back, Fisher
said. ‘

“Little would I have suspected
that the Dingell staff of a
Congress subcommittee would
be after the University of
Pittsburgh and the same scenario
would play out — get rid of
Fisher and you’ll be OK,” he
said.

According to Fisher, the next
morning Thomas Detre, senior
vice chancellor for health sci-
ences, called him and said a deci-
sion on what to do had to be
made.

Fisher said Detre urged him
not to fight because it would be a

long battle and suggested that he
be put on administrative leave. “I
did not resign,” he said.

By the end of that day, Fisher
said new stationery eliminating
names appeared in the NSABP
oﬁice.

Dingell’s first subcommittee
hearing was on April 13, and
Fisher did not attend. He did
attend the second one on June 15.

“During this time the universi-
ty required that we cooperate
fully by providing documents
that were used against me,” he
said.

, This is one example of a
breach of academic freedom,
Fisher said.

Fisher said he is not an expert
or even highly knowledgeable
about academic freedom, but he
is now learning about it.

“This story indicates that a
major threat to academic free-
dom relates to the government
coming into an institution, calling
the shots, and the university is
unfortunately failing to act and
protect its independence,” Fisher
said.

“And that’s a very serious
thing for a scientist. If they can
do that to me, what they did,
without a hearing, without an
opportunity for me to present my
side of the story and to have no
access to knowing what was
being said against me in an age
of funded research, this can be
done in any academic setting.”

Fisher’s definition of academic
freedom allows faculty members
to‘ do their work and perform
their intellectual freedom without
any outside inﬂuence from pow-
erful institutions or the govem—
ment.

“Anything that makes it
impossible to carry out an acade-
mic function constitutes a breach
of academic freedom in my esti-
mation,” he said.

According to Fisher, a univer-

sity official received a letter from A

the NCI saying that the NSABP
must submit all manuscripts to
the NCI for approval before sub-
mission to any publication.

“And then the University of
Pittsburgh subrriitted a corrective
plan‘ of action by the new director
of the NSABP. And in that cor-
rective plan of action, he stated
that manuscripts submitted to
The ‘New England Journal of
Medicine were simultaneously
provided to the NCI, but hence-
forth all other manuscripts will
be submitted to the NCI for
approval prior to submission for

publication,” Fisher said.

He said members of the
NSABP Executive Committee
and Oversight Committee felt
this was-not acceptable, but were
told it would only be for a three-

month probation period.

Neighbors aren't iailers

In New Jersey, criminals released from prison who are
deemed “sexually violent offenders” are required to register
with police after they leave prison. The law was inspired by
an incident in which a 7-year-old girl was killed and the
leading suspect was a convicted sex offender who lived
across the street from the girl, according to The Pittsburglr
Post-Gazette. In a fascist move, the Pennsylvania lawmak-
ers are looking to follow along with New Jersey.

Yesterday, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that
State Senator Stewart Greenleaf has proposed a similar
measure. Under Greenleaf’s bill, paroled sex offenders will
have to register with Pennsylvania State Police, and the
state police would notify victims, neighbors, local law
enforcement and schools and youth agencies.

Greenleaf, a Republican from Montgomery, said that
telling neighbors would be a way of real protection for soci-
ety. Yet what he really proposes is a way to make criminals
pay continuously after they have served their time in prison.

While he’s at it, after Greenleaf has had his experts deem
which ones -are “sexual predators,” he could have a tattoo
artist on hand to mark these people’s foreheads. If everyone
has the opportunity to ostracize these individuals, then soci-
ety will be truly protected.

While this sort of extremism is not likely to happen in the
near future, there‘is another problem with these sort of noti-
fication laws. If people know there is a criminal in the
neighborhood, they may try to force him out by means of

‘intimidation. Victims and their families who know where

their attackers are living may try to exact revenge, feeling
that the criminal justice system has not done its job.

The New York Times reported one attack in which two
men in ski masks attacked a third as he slept in his home.
This took place in New Jersey and has been linked to the
law requiring that criminals register their whereabouts with
agencies other than their parole officers.

The offenders are under the restrictions of their parole
and have a parole officer to monitor them. This measure
wants to turn everyone into a parole officer, or perhaps a
prison guard, making parolees prisoners in their own
homes. Moving toward a police state where communities
become prisons and ordinary citizens wardens at best or
judge, jury and executioners at worst, will not help this
country solve the crime problem. Stronger communities,
however, will. .

Communities consist of people living together and look-
ing out for each other in a- spirit of neighborliness, not

watching each other out of suspicion. If people were to look 7

out for each other in the beginning and if we had fewer
incidences like the infamous.Kitty Genovese case in which
neighbors ignored a stabbing victim’s cry for help, there
wouldbe no need for notification laws.

Grand unified physics - hair theory

re you having a bad
hair day‘? Does your
hair feel dry and brit-

, tle to the touch? If your hair

suffers like mine during this
time of year, then I’m
wagering that the cold, dry
winter weather has dried out
your hair. If my little wager
is correct and your hair is
more brittle than a dog’s
water bowl in Alaska, then
I’ll also bet you’re trying to
do something about your
hair’s condition.

I’m not really taking a
gamble here. (Or is it
“hair”?) Last year we spent
millions of dollars on hair
products just to keep our
locks young, fresh and ﬂexi-
ble. Heaven and hair prod-
ucts helps us if our hair
starts to feel old, stale and
brittle. .

We. all seem to realize that
when compared to all the
other biological processes
that can go awry, suffering
from dry hair is relatively

, mild.

I think it is safe to say that
if forced to choose, most of

: us would take brittle hair

over brittle bones any day. If
any of us were diagnosed
with massive multiple organ
failure, we would probably
be much more fatalistic from
that than from having failed
follicles.
‘ Though the medical mal-
adies of brittle bones and
bad organs are more severe
than bad hair, the bones and
the organs are, of course, on
the inside of the body. And
we tend to think about the
inside of our body quite dif-
ferently from the outside.
There seems to be a
human tendency to ignore or
delay treatment for body
parts that we cannot see but
to which somethinghas
gone wrong. For many of us,
the skin of the body acts like
a large rug. Rarely do we

look and check for what
might be accumulating or
corroding under the epider-
mal human carpet called the
skin.

Hair, unless you’re refer-
ring to a cat with fur balls, is
on the outside of the body.
Hair is predominantly
poised ,on- the top of our
heads. Acting like a beacon,
our hair waves to the world
as we bounce on our way to
our destinies; that is, unless
your hair is dry and brittle.
Then there is not much
bounce, and destiny itself
may be in question. This
brings us back to your hair’s
condition and what to do
about it.

Some days it seems impos-
sible to do anything to help
dry hair. If a dump truck
would somehow park out-
sidethe shower stall and
magically dispense tons of
conditioner’ onto the cranium
plate, it wouldn’t help. The
hair would still be bone-
china dry, the fingers tor-
tured as if Kubla Khan’s
warriors lashed lacerations
across their tips.

Much like a magnet with-
out its ability to attract and
grab, the merging fields of
my fingers and hair just
don’t click. There’s an
axiom in the field of
Newtonian physics which
states that for every action
there is an equal and oppo-
site reaction. Sorry Isaac,
this law doesn’t apply to dry
hair.

Something is amiss, and
there is heresy in my hair.
For I can partake in the vig-
orous actions of shampoo-

ing. rinsing and repeating V

more times than the number
pi, but there still would be
no reaction from my hair.
Maybe I should consult
physicist Steven Hawking
instead of Isaac Newton. I
would ask Steve, where does

the reaction from the condi-
tioner go? In my ear? I
doubt it! Instead, the hair
products are sucked down
the drain quicker than a
galactic black hole gobbles a
quasar.

Sadly, like the quasar, my
hair has lost its luster, and
much like the black hole’s
vacuum, my hair’s condition
is irreversible. No quirky
anti-matter hair formula,
dump truck full of cream
rinse or magic space-aged
dye can help my hollowing

head of hair. If applied, none .

of these therapeutic serums
would change the true brittle
state of my hair.

As you may have sur-
mised, I try to be scientific
about the way my fingers
feel and respond to my hair.
Empirically this approach is
solid, but functionally the
way that my fingers feel my
hair weaves into porous,
personal and emotional feel-
ings. ,

For example, when my
hair is dry, I tend to stick to
the Background at parties. If
my hair is dirty, then I might
only socialize at all-night
bowling alleys. If my hair is

both dry and dirty, then I.

choose not to really see the
day. Instead, I’ll wait until
nightfall to go outside, and
usually I’ll wear a baseball
cap.

It’s not that I want great,
healthy hair every day. Just
let me snap open the shower
curtain and brush back hair
that flows like an ocean
breeze — not hair that looks
and feels like a helmet.

Sparing no expense, if you

can recommend any hair -

products, I would like to
hair, errr, I mean hear from
you. Otherwise, I’ll have to
wait until the spring thaw. _

thing that even ‘remotely

ball, but the lumber and

The owners will bring in the
replacement players, and the
real major leaguers will picket
at the beginning.

That’s right, at the begin- _
ning. How long can Barry
Bonds pass up $50,000 a day?

Cracks are already starting
to show in the players’ armor.
Greg Swindell and Lenny
Dykstra have already implied
that they might cross thelines
and play. And you know
what, sooner or later they all
will. It will start as a drip,
turn into a trickle and explode
into an all—out flood.

How much do the players
need to gain? The major
league minimum is over
$100,000, and the average
player makes over $1 .000,000
a season.

Think about it: major lea-
guers make more money in a
single year than most of us
will see in a lifetime. Don’t
give me this crap about think-
ing about their futures and the
future of other players. If you
can’t live on $5,000,000, then
you need financial coun-
selling.-And just think, some
players will make that kind of
money each year over a five
to 10 year period.

The whole idea of the play-
ers being a union is the
‘biggestjoke l’ve ever heard.
These players negotiate their
own contracts. The United
Steelworkers of America
negotiate a contract for their
entire local’s membership.
And if the players are a union,
why didn’t they refuse to
cross the umpires’ picket lines
when they went on strike a
few years ago? Union? I don’t
think so.

Don’t get me wrong, I love
baseball. Ijust hate what
many of these players have
become. Many players won't
even sign an autograph unless
theyiget paid for it.

These players have lives
that the rest of us can only
dream about. A six or seven
figure salary to play the great-
est game known to mankind
sounds pretty good to me. But
the players still want more.
How much more do they
need?

Just about any coach in any
sport will tell you that there’s a
right time for a team to peak in
the course of a season. Peak too
early and the team burns out.
Peak too late and the team may
be in hole that it can’t dig itself
out of.

The University of Pittsburgh
wrestling team is wrestling its
best at just the right time.
Despite losing 20-12 this past
Thursday night, the team is posi-
tioning itself nicely for its tough-
est stretch of the year.

“We’re. wrestling our best
right now,” head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “The team is

Frenza, Sullivan pace
Pitt men's tennis team

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Pitt’s Christian Frenza and

Mike Sullivan landed a place in _

the men’s tennis team record
books this weekend at the Cost
Center, as the Panthers hosted a
seven-team individual tourna-
ment.

Frenza
a n d
Sullivan
won the
Flight B
doubles
competi-
t i o n ,
which was the ﬁrst time any Pitt
doubles team has ever won in
Pitt’s ﬁve-year history of hosting
this tournament.

“It was the greatest accom-

 

V plishment of the weekend,” Pitt

head coach George Dieffenbach
said. “The team they beat was
deﬁnitelyya quality team. It was
an exciting match.” ‘

Frenza and Sullivan defeated
West Virginia’s Mark Nijalan
and Ben Jacobs 7-6, 7-6 in the
ﬁnals to take home the charnpi—
onship.

Pitt also won 13 main draw
singles wins to seal another
Panther record against some
tough competition. I

p The other teams involved were
Buffalo University, West

Virginia, Carnegie-Mellon,
Duquesne, Robert Morris and
Akron.

Pitt’s No. 1 seed, Braden
Doherty, squeaked a first round
win out against Stuart Evans of
Robert Morris 4-6, 6-4, 7-6.
Doherty went on to ﬁnals, where
he lost to the eventual champion,
Akron’s Greg Llewellyn, 6-1, 6-
4.

In the Flight C competition,
Pitt’s Brad Wade cruised to the
ﬁnals as he won the first round
6-4, 6-2 and the semiﬁnals 6-2,
6-0. Like Doherty, Wade lost in-
the finals, this time to West
Virgina’s Matt Feeney, 6-3, 7-6.

Sullivan also did some damage
in the singles competition.
Playing in the Flight D competi-
tion, Sullivan made it to the
finals before faltering to Jacobs,
6-4, 6-4 — the same man he
teamed up to beat in the doubles
ﬁnal.

In the last ﬂight, Pitt’s Matt
Mills also made it to the ﬁnals.
Mills lost -to Steve Duffin of
West Virginia 6-0, 6-1.

“We had a lot of competition
in one weekend,” Dieffenbach
said. “To win over the quality of
competition was a big boost.”

The men’s tennis team, 5-1 for
the season, lost to the University
of Pennsylvania last weekend 7-
0. Pitt then went on to beat
Maryland 4-3.

Duquesne, gear’ up for Big East

By Jim Wheeler ‘
For The Pitt News

One may look at the 110-36
victory over Duquesne as a
clear definition of domina-
tion. But the modest Pitt
men’s swimming and diving
team, swimming their off
events, looked at Saturday’s
meet as a fun day for college
athletics.

“We swam fine,” said
Panther Coach Chuck Knoles.
“All the guys got to pick their
own events. Swimming
against Duquesne is a low key
meet for us. We didn’t have to
worry about the win, and we
can concentrate on the Big

East Championship in two .

weeks.” ,

Due to Duquesne not com-
peting in the 3-meter competi-
tion, the teams competed
twice in the 1-meter. Junior
Jeremy McClean took first
with scores of 140.90 and
208.90. Sophomore John

Soulakis took second in both

events with scores of 132.45

and 199.40 and freshman

Chris Curry finished third

(92.90) and (129.70).
The 200-meter relay medley
team of senior Jonti

Bacharach, junior Chris Perry,
junior. Tony Sunseri and
freshman Steve Lewter fin-

ished first with a time of
1:37.33. Perry also finished
first in the 50 free (22.17).

“Yesterday’s meet was a fun
meet,” said Perry. “It was no
pressure for us. We got to
swim off events. We used that
to look at our times as an
indicator of where we’ll be in
two weeks.”

Senior David Williams fin-
ished first in the 1,000
freestyle (l0:18.11), the 100
free (48.12) and the 500 free
(4157.39). Behind him in the
100 was senior teammate
Ryan Bair (49.09) and Sunseri
finished third (49.78). Sunseri
also finished first _in the 200
ﬂy (1:59.22). C

Senior Matt Brady finished
first in the 100 back (51.35).
Freshman Mike McQueen

took second (52.09) and _

freshman Pete Hezky took
third (52.53). Hezky also fin-
ished first in the‘l00 fly
(52.30).

The Panthers also finished
first, second and third in the
200 free — junior Eric Stull
(1245.45), Sami Vartiainen
(1245.50) and senior Ryan
Bair (1249.14).

In the 100 breaststroke
freshman Doug Landy took
first (1202.53) and sophomore

John Heynes took second

Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s swim
team ended its dual meet
season Saturday on a posi-
tive note. Pitt’s demolition
of Duquesne ended in a 182-
70 victory. - »

Overall, the team’s regular
season ended with a disap-

pointing losing record of 4-

7.

Last season, the team’s
win—loss record was
reversed, and the Panthers
were on the better side of the
7-4 record. But this does not
concern senior captain Vicki
Geubtner.

“I feel more confident with

this year’s team than I did
with last year’s team going
into the Big
Championships,” Geubtner
said. “The girls in the fresh-
man class have really swam
well. I am really impressed
with them. I feel the team is

East‘

definitely more exciting than C

it was a year ago. Just like

our coaches say, we do not ,

pay attention to the wins and
losses. We just swim as hard
as we can. If we do this, then
we never lose.”

to contribute again. We play
the best when we play as a
team,” Bruce said.

Pitt, which had defeated-

Boston College three consec-
utive times, led for much of
the first half.

The Lady Panthers enjoyed
their last lead of the game
with 3:22 remaining in the
first half when Jenine Joyce

‘drained a jumper to give Pitt

a 24-22 margin. By the end of
the half, the Eagles had
opened up a 29-26 lead.
Midway through the second
half, the Lady Panthers tied
the "game at 36-36 when for-
ward Tressa Bolfert made a
basket and canned the foul
shot for a three-point play.
The tie would not last long,
however. When Boston

College guard Kim Beezer
followed’ with two of her 21
points, the Eagles went up
38-36 and continued to widen
their lead from there.

BC forward Holly Porter
led all scorers with 24 points
on 10-12 shooting. Beezer
added a game-high 12
rebounds.

“Losses are always disap-
pointing this late in the sea-
son,” Bruce said,

“However, I don’t think the
team was looking past Boston
College.”

Boston College outscored
the Lady Panthers 31-14 dur-
ing the final nine minutes of
the game, and with 12.3 sec-
onds remaining, it enjoyed a
17-point lead, its largest of
the game.

“We have been in a-little bit

of a slowdown offensively.
We have been playing good
defense, so we should turn
things around soon,” Petho
said.

Things will be difficult to
turn around Thursday at the
Fitzgerald Field House when
the Lady Panthers host top-
ranked and undefeated
Connecticut. The tip-off is
scheduled for 7:30 p.m.

Bruce said that the key to
defeating.Player of the Year
candidate Rebecca Lobo and
the rest of the Lady Huskies
is to keep possession of the
ball, committing few
turnovers and having a good
shot selection.

“We are in a no-lose situa-
tion. Nobody thinks we are
going to win, but you never
know,” Petho said.

Williams said. “My goals are
to jump high and hit the ball
hard.”

Leading the attack for
Canada was Janis Kelly, who
registered 21 kills and three
aces.

Also having a big night for
Team USA were the Oden sis-
ters, Elaina and Bev. Elaina
finished the match with 13
kills and three blocks, and
younger sister Bev had nine
kills and one block.

“It’s really neat actually,”
Bev Oden said of the opportu-

“We don’t fight on the court or
off the court. It’s nice having
her around.”

Elaina, a member of the

Bev Oden, who won 1990
NCAA player of the year, was
named 1994 rookie of the year
on the Bud Light four—player
beach circuit this past summer.

“I got in really good shape
on the beach,” Oden said.
“Moving on the beach makes
you a lot quicker when you get
indoors. You feel like you are
skying when you jump. I
gained four inches on my verti-
cal jump this past year alone. It
helps physically, but not with
your skills.”

Bev and E1aina’s oldest sister
Kim was also a member of the
1988 and 1992 Olympic teams.
All three sisters have won the
NCAA Player of the Year
award a grand total of four
times. Kim won it twice.

Another player with
Olympic experience is outside
hitter Tara Cross-Battle. Cross-
Battle ended the match with 10

kills. She is also a former_

NCAA player of the year,‘win-
ning the award twice (1988-
89).

“I felt all right,” Cross—Battle
said. “I did my job, and we
won the match.”

Anchoring the rest of the
lineup for Team USA are 1992
Olympic veterans Tammy
Liley, Lori Endicott and Yoko
Zetterlund. Endicott is consid-
ered one of the world’s premier
setters and has won numerous
honors, including the best set-
ter award at the 1992

- Olympics. Liley, the team cap-

tain since 1993, recorded six
kills against Canada on Friday
night.

Other members of the team
that played on Friday are
Samantha Shaver (one kill),
Kristin Klein (three kills),
Danielle Scott (two kills),
Alicia Mills-Polzin (four kills)

and Natalie Williams (three ‘
kills).

The Stars and Spikes tour
versus Canada comes to an end
on Feb. 14. After that the team
will return to San Diego and
begin training for the Pan Am
games in March.

“It’s tough playing the same
team night in and night" out,”
Cross—Battle said, “especially
when you are winning. It’s eas-
ier to get up when you are
playing a team that you have a
tough time with.”

“It’s been hard for us to get
up,” Bev Oden said. “Canada
can play really, really well or
they can be in the bottom of
the tank, and right now they
are not coming out and playing
well.”

Hoping to improve on a
somewhat disappointing
bronze medal in 1992, the
team has goals that seem easily

were decided underdogs as they
traveled to face the llth-ranked
Edinboro Fighting Scots in an
Eastern Wrestling League show-
down. The Panthers’ record
overall fell to 12-8 and 2-2 in the
league.

The Panthers had to swallow
the bitter pill of three one-point
matches that decided the out-
come of the evening’s matches.

“We lost those three matches,”
Stottlemyer said, “and we could
have just as easily won those
three matches.”

Down 3-0, Pitt freshman Chad
Jesko, in the 126-pound division,
blanked Edinboro’s Zip Spencer
6-0 to tie the match at 3-3.

“Chad Jesko did a tremendous
job for us,” Stottlemyer said.

Pitt’s Chris Cox lost a major
decision 12-3 that left Pitt trail-
ing 7-3 after the third match of
the evening.

The rock of the Panther
wrestling team, J .J . Fasnacht,
brought Pitt back with a 5-2 vic-
tory over Thad Marcelli to make
the score 7-6 Edinb_oro. Fasnacht
continues to lead the Pitt team
with 23 total victories on the sea-
son. ,

“J .J . has been pretty consistent
for us all year,” Stottlemyer said.

The first of Pitt’s one-point
losses occurred at the 150-pound
mark. Brett Gould lost 10-9 to a
strong Tom Shifllet.

\V1th the score 10-6 in favor of
Edinboro, another loss via a
major decision in the 158 weight
class put Pitt down 14-6 with
over half of the matches com-
pleted.

Sophomore Bryan Matusic
drew Pitt three points closer by

,defeating Eric Gross 9-4.

Matusic’s victory narrowed the
Edinboro lead to 14-9. A

Pitt losses in the next two
weight classes were the turning
points that gave the Scots an
unsurrnountable 20-9 lead.

A tough 5-4 defeat in the 177-
pound class and Mark Bodo’s
heartbreaking 2-1 loss to highly
rated Jason Robison put Pitt
behind the eight ball.

Heavyweight Pat Wiltanger
returned from a slight knee
injury to win the evening’s ﬁnal
match 2-0, making the final
score 20-12 in favor of

' Edinboro.

Although never satisfied with
losing, the Panthers’ perfor-
mance pleased the Pitt coaching
staff.

“We came in here and wres-
tled a team tough, a team that on
paper, we shouldn’t have even
been able to compete with,”
Stottlemyer said. “We were a
decided underdog on that day.”

Next for the Panthers is anoth-
er away match against EWL

Duquesne, the men’s swim-

for the Big East

have won 11 out of the past
12 years.

we~'can do is stand up, race

this. The team is doing great.”

first place. But at least they’re
trying to fix it.

I don’t think the players
realize how good they have it.

They say that they don’t
want a cap to be put on their
salaries. But why should they
live any differently than the
rest of us? Almost every place
of employment budgets a cer-
tain amount of money toward
payroll to pay its employees.
We all have to live within
those means; so should the
players.

I hope the players all come

egos back to earth. Maybe
they’ll realize how lucky they
are to have the God-given. tal-
ent to play baseball and realize

that there is more to the game I‘

than just how much money
one can make.

Perhaps the game can be
saved so we the fans will once
again be truly recognized as
the most important partici-
pants of the game. If it weren’t
for the fans, there wouldn’t be
any game in the first place.

more Charla Caponi in the

200 medley relay, the team
of Lauren Dale, Leslie
Becki, Isabel Dejo and

tinued her dominance.

She won the l-meter com-
petition. In second place was
Kara Sixbury. Coming in
fourth, sixth and seventh,
respectively, were Amy
Spinnenweber, Buffy "Smith
and Courtney Sunseri.

Due to the fact that
Duquesne has no 3—meter
board ‘divers, there was no 3-
meter competition.

“I felt good about the ‘way
that I dove this past meet,”
said Lewandowski.

“The main focus is on the

two weeks. We have worked
extremely hard all year, and
now we are tapering before
the final event of the season.
We are still practicing two
times every day, but not as
hard as we were before.”

The highlight of the meet
was accomplished by junior
diver,Amy Spinnenweber.
Spinnenweber qualified for

the NCAA Pre-Qualification
Meet. This ‘meet is com-
prised of five divers from the
region. .

“I am extremely happy tha
I finally made NCAAs,” said
Spinnenweber. “This is a big
step for me. I do not know
what to expect, but Sunday
[Lewandowski] does. I am
sure that she will help me.”

Other Pitt divers that have
already qualified for the
NCAA Pre-Qualification
Meet are Lewandowski,
Sixbury and Smith.

“Amy has been doing real-
ly well,” said Lewandowski.
“Everyone on the team is
happy for her. It is her first
time qualifying for the
NCAAs. It is a very big deal.
It is great to see us so well
represented in these competi-
tions. It makes our coaching
staff proud. They put in a
lot of time into our diving.”

The final chapter of the
season for the Panthers will

be written in two weeks at
the Big East Championships.
The team. anxiously awaits
the meet, which will be held
at Pitt’s Trees Hall.

“It is such a big advantage
to have the Big East
Championships at our home
pool,” said Geubtner.

“Everyone is excited to

‘swim fast,” said Dileonardo.

“We have worked hard all
year for this. This is our big
meet, the ending. Whether
we get first place or last
place, we know that we have
worked our hardest. We will
just swim the best that we
can.”

“Our major goal this year is

to win the World Cup,” Cross- "

Battle said. “We want to get
the winning of a few tourna-
ments under our belt before
that.”

“I think we just need to focus
right now,” Williams said. “We
have to have a higher level of
intensity and more communi-
cation.” .

“We’ve really come along
way the last couple months,”
Bev Oden said. “We are really
working on playing together.
We want to win the World Cup
and Grand Prix for sure.”

°From page 6

According to Fisher, this is still
occurring and is a change in
terms of the grant award.

Fisher said this does not corre-
late with university bylaws on
academic freedom and does not
correspond to a university policy
statement dated April 3, I992.

“The university shall not
accept awards or enter into agree-
ments for the support of research
which confers upon another party
with the power to censor or exer-

cise effective veto or with the dis-
semination of results and conclu-

sions arising from research,“

according to Fisher.
“No agreement should preju-
dice the right of the researchers

who publish the results of their _

research. Researchers require
equal protection from unsupport-
ed charges or charges made out
of misinterpretation, ignorance or
malice.

“Once accepted by the univer-
sity, the university must not

it-*--STUDEN  

GVERN MEN T  

change the condition of the
award unless unusual circum-
stances, in which case consulta-
tion with the investigators who
have the right to appeal such
things.”

Fisher continued to say articles
found under infonnation services
of the NCI and the National
Library of Medicine written by
Fisher and his colleagues have
been tagged as scientific miscon-
duct. One includes “an intellectu-
al piece with no data” written by

 

Student Government Board—

Monday, February 13, 1995 at 8:30 P.M.

Fisher. '_

“These breaches of academic
freedom  relate to lack of due
process; interference with publi-
cations; telling us where, when
and how to publish; tampering
with databases  prejudging
guilt; interference with freedom
to speak out  mandating condi-
tions for grants  intimidation
and so on.”

By showing what happened,
Fisher said he hopes that this
will not happen again in other
academic settings. ’

“Perhaps by telling you how
privacy was invaded, how my
ﬁles of 30 years were invaded in
an attempt to obtain information
that was ostensively to be used to
protect me, but went instead to
the Dingell subcommittee staff of
Congress and the NCI used

against me,” said Fisher. “And
perhaps if I tell you how I and
my colleagues were violated
with nobody to serve as our
advocates, I will be serving a
purpose.”

Fisher said he is not upset with
the university as a whole. For 58
years, he has been involved with
the university — undergraduate
and medical school work and
then returning to work here in
1952. 0

“I still treasure the good things
that have happened to me as a
result of my university affilia-
tion,” he said. “My feeling about
the university remains the same
as it did over the years. However,
my feelings relative to certain
individuals in the University of
Pittsburgh organization are
another story.”
