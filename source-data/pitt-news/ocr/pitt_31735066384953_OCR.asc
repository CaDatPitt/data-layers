IFC informs public of new fraternity policies

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

In order to explain the new
policies adopted during last
night's InterFraternity Council
meeting and try to smooth rela-

tions with the Bellefield commu-

nity, IFC President Chuck
Farinella addressed the Bellefield
Area Citizens Association last
night. I

’’I’m willing to believe [Farinel-
la] that the fraternities are really
going to try to carry out the
promises that they made to us this
summer,” said Helen Schlenke,
president of BACA, ”and I cer-
tainly hope it will work.”

Farinella referred to two new
rules passed during the IFC meet-
ing: that there must be a coher-
ent person to answer the phone
to address complaints and that
the outside of ,a fraternity house

_ must be cleaned by 10 a.m. He

said, ”We want to be more of an
asset to the community.”

Some of the members of BACA
listening to Farinella were skep-
tical of the new policies. ”We’ve
been through this time after time
with various IFC presidents,” said
one member.

Schlenke said that unrespon-
siveness on the part of previous
IFC presidents has been a
problem. ”At one time, there was
one who did respond,” she said.
”Since that time, we haven't real-

Open rush begins tomorrow
for Pitt's sororities, and the
Panhellenic Association plans
to take an active role in
educating this year's rushees
about alcohol
AIDS and the Greek system.

”Once we get all, of our
pledges, Panhel is goingto try
to take more responsibility for
the education process,” said
Michelle Jedlica, president of
the Pitt Panhellenic Associa-
tion/‘We want the rushees to
know early on about Panhel.”

This year, the Panhellenic
Association will sponsor an
educational program about al-
cohol on Sept. 13. Another
program entitled ”Drinking
Responsibly” will be present-
ed on Oct. 20 in conjunction

with the InterFraternity
Council.
On Nov. 29, an AIDS

awareness program will be

presented by the Panhellenic

Association and the IFC.
”Our growing and changing

awareness,

never stops, and education
never stops,” Jedlica said.

According to Jedlica, there
are just about as many girls
rushing this year as there were
last year; however, the quotas
for each individual sorority
have increased to 18.

”—

Panhel is going to try
to take more responsi-
bility for the education
process.

”This is a sign to me that the
Greek system is getting
stronger,” Jedlica said.
”Stronger membership means
a stronger system.

”We had a lot of freshmen
this year but also a lot of up-
perclassmen,” she said.

Formal rush ends next Fri-
day with "ribboning/’ when
the rushees will find their bids.

Panhel prepares for sorority rush

Open rush will continue
throughout the term for those
sororities that have filled their
quotas but still do not have 55
members.

Jedlica explained that during
open rush, ”it's up to each
sorority how they want to
present themselves.”

According to Janet Silliman,
rush coordinator for Alpha
Delta Pi, ”We’re going to go
casual with open rush. Our
objective is to meet the girls in
a more relaxed environment
as opposed to the stricter at-
mosphere of formal rush.”

Jedlica said that ”the houses
really just do their own thing
and really don't try to com-
pete. They try to show the
rushees whether or not this
sorority is right for them.”

Jedlica explained that if the
new rushees are educated
about Panhel at an earlier
point in their sorority lives,
they may begin to run for Pan-
hellenic offices as under-
classmen.

SCB votes to continue
student legal service

By William Young
Managing Editor

The Student Government
Board yesterday voted to con-
tinue the student legal service for
the next school year. The service
costs $3,151 and covers a
$100-a-week honorarium for two
hours of a professional lawyer's
time as well as advertisements.

Robin Shepard, allocations
committee chairperson, recom-
mended the board approve the
continuance, saying that/‘This is
one of the best services thatthe
Student Government Board offers
the student body.” _

Two other topics of importance
to students concerned bicycle
racks and condom machines.

Board member Tanya Jackson
indicated that she had spoken to
Walter Waters about installing
more bike racks but that the main
problem with obtaining more
racks was cost. Board President
Craig Jackson said that he would
like to see an additional bike rack

placed in front of the William Pitt
Union. Tanya Jackson also talked
to Sgt. Greer of the campus
police about registering student's
bicycles with the campus police.

Pamela Rich stated that she was
going to get in contact with ad-
ministration officials to reopen
the issue of placing condom
machines on campus. Board
President Craig Jackson said that
the board originally wanted
’’health service” machines that
would have included toothpaste
and soap as well as condoms.

”What we wanted to do is have
health service machines,” Jack-
son said, ”that would have tooth-
paste and gum people
shouldn't feel funny going up
there because they could be buy-
ing five or six other things [in-
stead of condoms]/’

The problem with installing
them in the bathrooms in the
dorms, Jackson said, was that it
would cost a lot of money and
they would be subject to van-
dalism.

 

Peach Bottom nuclear fine will not be contested“

WASHINGTON (AP) -
Philadelphia Electric Co. has
decided not to contest a record
$1.25 million fine levied because
control room operators slept on
duty at Pennsylvania's Peach Bot-
tom nuclear plant, The Associat-
ed Press learned Wednesday.

Three other utilities in New Jer-
sey and Delaware would be lia-
ble for portions of the fine
because they are part-owners of
Peach Bottom, a PECO official
said.

The fine, the largest in NRC his-
tory, was levied against Philadel-
phia Electric on Aug. 11 ”for
failing to detect, report and deal
with inattentive operators, and
supervisors who condoned it.”

The Peach Bottom fine is the
largest since Congress gave the
NRC authority to issue civil
penalties in 1969. But it pales in
comparison to the $100 million

that Philadelphia Electric has al-
ready lost because of the cost of
purchasing replacement power.

Shooting and suicide

in Montour County

LIMESTONEVILLE, Pa. (AP) —
A Montour County woman broke
into her ex-husband's home, shot
him while he was in bed with
another woman and then com-
mitted suicide after fleeing the
scene, police said Wednesday.

Darlene Cotner, 42, of rural
Danville, was found about a
quarter—mile south of the shoot-
ing scene, according to state
police. Cpt. Donald Seidel said
she died of an apparent self-'
inflicted shotgun wound to the
head.

Her ex-husband, Franklin Cot-
ner, 42, of Limestonesville, was
listed in satisfactory condition

New fraternity to open
chapter on Pitt campus

By Michele Quinn

Staff Writer

Phi Sigma Kappa will be ex-
panding to the Pitt campus this
fall after the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil approved theircolony during
Tuesday night's meeting.

”We considered a number of
schools and thought Pitt offered
us the best possible choice of ex-
pansion,” said’ Terry Boots, Phi
Sigma Kappa province president
for Western Pennsylvania. ”We
think this is a strong and improv-
ing Greek system.”

”More Greeks on campus [are]
better for the rest of us,” IFC
President Chuck Farinella said.

Phi Sigma Kappa will not be or-
ganizing any formal events until
fall term’s rush is over.

”We are going to be looking
for the person who doesn't rush
any other fraternity,” Boots said.
”... The people who see these
other fraternities and say they ar-
en’t suitable for them.

”Our groups are a varied A

bunch. We have some chapters
that are all athletes and others
that are very academically
strong,” Boots said. ”We are go-
ing to get people to make a frater-
nity what they want it to be.”

If accepted by the IFC as a
chapter, however, they would
not be able to set up housing for
two to four years.

”We would start organizing a
housing contract company in two
to three years,” Boots said.

Boots was asked during the dis-
cussion at the IFC meeting if he
thought the lack of housing

would act as a deterrent for per-
spective members.

”Housing does not make a
fraternity,” he said.

During late October or early
November, Phi Sigma Alpha will
be using central spots on campus,
such as the William Pitt Union,
in order to provide information
for students who are interested.

The ”associates” chosen to be-
gin this colony will spend eight
weeks learning the mechanics of
running a fraternity.

”We are hoping to become a
chapter within one to two years,”
Boots said.

In order for a colony to become

” a chapter, it must first pass the tri-

al period setup by the IFC. Boots
estimated that the colony would
need at least 35 members before
becoming a chapter.

”Membership must be at or
equal to the average of the other
fraternities combined,” he com-
mented. ”We are hoping to be
established as a chapter in one to
two years.”

Phi Sigma Kappa was first es-
tablished in 1873 at the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts. At this
point, it has grown to include 104
chapters and colonies na-
tionwide.

Some of these locations in-
clude: Clarion University,
Towson in Maryland, Robert
Morris College, Indiana Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania and the
University of lllinois. The Phi Sig-
ma Kappa chapter at Penn State
is 90 years old, while the West
Virginia chapter will be celebrat-
ing its 100—year anniversary this
year

ly had much [response].

”This year, we didn’t try to han-
dle it all by ourselves. We called
in the police, we called‘ in the
university, we called in the South
Oakland Citizens’ Council.”

The problems that the commu-

nity has had in the past were ex-
cessive noise, littering and some
vandalism. Noise was the most
persistent and common problem,
such as loud music,’firecrackers
late at night and the honking of
horns.
V Andrew Bowen, president of
the Triangle fraternity, was also
present at the meeting and has
been going BACA meetings re-
cently.

’’I just wanted to know what
was going on, the way the com-

, munity felt about us,” said Bo-

wen. ”We talked to our
immediate neighbors and they
didn't express any problem about
our house.

”We very much like living in
the Bellfield area, and as it be-
came apparent to me, as presi-
dent, that these problems exsisted
and that there is a high level of
dislike and interest in getting rid
of the fraternities in the area, I
wanted to try and help calm
some of their fears and try to ex-
press our interest in staying in the
area.”

Farinella also said that fraterni-
ties causing disturbances will do
community service and en-
couraged the members of BACA
to report any problem to the
house in question first.

”We’ll try to do our part by

sending our complaints to the
fraternity houses in the first in-
stance,” said Schlenke.

As a gesture of good will, '

Farinella told BACA to call on the
Pitt fraternities i_f they ever need
help for something in their com-
munity.

”VVe haven't had any problem
that I know of so far this rush sea-
son,” said Schlenke. ”|’l| try to be
optimistic.”

For The Pitt News

Eight construction workers
remain hospitalized as a result
of an explosion which
devastated the newly built Za-
mias Aquatic Center at the
Johnstown campus of the
University of Pittsburgh on
Aug. 31. UPJ’s Public Safety
Director Kevin Grady said he

cannot comment on the prob- '

able cause of the explosion at
this time.

Fifteen workers were injured
in the blast and admitted to
four area hospitals. Two of the
workers, James Walker and
Roger Musser, were later
flown from
Memorial Hospital to the Mer-
cy Hospital burn unit in

Johnstown,

Pittsburgh.

According to Mary Jeanne
Krob, director of the burn unit,
Musser is still in critical con-
dition and Walker's condition
has been upgraded to serious.

Prior to the explosion at ap-
proximately 3 p.m., a gym
class was in session in the
Sports Center, which is con-
nected to the Aquatic Center.
No students or staff members
in the Sports Center were
injured.

The explosion caused exten-
sive damage to the Aquatic
Center, which was close to
completion, according to
Grady.

”We had hoped to start fill-
ing the pool within a week.
That's how close it was to be-
ing done,” Grady said.

Officials investigate fire at UPJ

The disturbance was initial-
ly reported by Athletic Direc-
tor Edward Sherlock, who was
in his office in the Sports
Center at the time of the explo-
sion. The Richland County
Fire Company, several local
volunteer fire companies and
all Johnstown area ambulance
services responded to calls
from public safety officers, ac-
cording to Grady.

Grady said he could not
comment on the probable
c Se of the explosion until
thefire marsha|l’s office com-
pletes its interviews with the
construction workers who
were present. Approximately
half of the workers have been
interviewed so far, according
to Grady.

What goes on behind the shelves at the book center

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

”The faculty selects books,”
said Barbara Simonoff, textbook
buyer for the University Book
Center. “We order the books for
the classes.”

It sounds simple, but the buy-
ing and selling of textbooks at the
book center is actually quite a
job.

The center is a self—sufficient
operation. They pay rent to Pitt
and pay their own employees.
While trying to sell textbooks at
the lowest possible price, the
center must also avoid losing
money.

The book center first receives
book requisition forms from
faculty with the author, title and
publisher of the books needed for
their classes, along with an esti-
mate of how many people will be
in each class. They then buy the
books from the publisher.

The price that the student pays
for each textbook depends most-
ly on the publisher. The center
puts a 10-25 percent mark—up on
the cost of buying the book from
the publisher. Some publishers
give discounts to the center,
which allows the center to sell
those textbooks at close to the
regular price.

The biggest problem concern-
ing textbooks is leftover books.
”Every book that you see down
here [in the book store] has
money invested in it,” said
Simonoff. This includes books
not bought by students. These
books must be sent back to the
publisher. It costs up to four per-
cent of the cost of all the books
to ship them back, and many
publishers charge a fee for
returned books.

I One of the ways the book

center TFIES TO CUT COST fOI' them-

selves and the students is through
used books. Books that are going
to be used again the next school
year are bought back at half the
original price. These books are
then sold at a 25 percent discount
from price of the new books. The
students get the discount and the
money made is reinvested into
new books and into maintaining
the book store.

Problems arise when the
faculty is unsure of whether a par-
ticular book will be used for next
year's classes. Often, when stu-
dents are selling their books, the
book center hasn't been informed
of the status of many textbooks.
Then they can’t afford to offer the
50 percent price. Simonoff said
she ”got burned” when she
bought used books and then
found out they were no longer
going to be used.

For those of you who missed it

0 Linebacker Ricardo Mc-
Donald became only the fifth
player to start the first game of his
freshman season for the Pitt Pan-
thers. The others? Tony Dorsett,
Hugh Green, Bill Fralic and Marc
Spindler.

McDonald, who started at
strongside linebacker, has been
moved to the weakside to allow
Curtis Bray, the Gatorade/Circle
of Champions High School Play-
er of the Year last season, to start
at the former position.

0 Speaking of linebackers,
former Pitt star Dennis Atiyeh will
attempt to wrestle in the
220—pound freestyle division for
Syria in the upcoming Olympics.

Atiyeh’s brother, Joe, won the
silver medal in the same class in
the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics,
the first and only medal won by
Syria.

0 Jeff Christy has returned to
the Panthers after recovering from
arthroscopic knee surgery. He is
expected to challenge for the

‘ starting punting job, now held by

sophomore Yusef Washington.

Washington saw his first start
against Northern Iowa Saturday
night, averaging 27 yards per
punt.

0 Washington has replaced
freshman Alex Van Pelt as the
third—string quarterback, behind
sophomores Darnell Dickerson
and Larry Wanke.

0 Curvin Richards, a freshman
tailback who broke free from the
UNI defense for a 47-yard touch-
down run Saturday night, has
been named the second-string
tailback, while Ricky Turner, also
a freshman, has been relegated to
third string.

0 Following possibly the best
year in the history of the organi-
zation, the Pitt volleyball team is
striving to become a nationally
recognized power.

Their quest continues this
weekend when head coach Shel-
ton Collier, AlI—American candi-
ate Denise Frawley and the rest
of the team head to Utah to face
Brigham Young University, Texas
and the University of Pacific in
the Brigham Young Classic.

All three opposing teams are
ranked in the Top 10 nationally.

Collier is also an assistant
coach for the 1988 United States
Olympic Team.

Linebacker Ricardo McDonald is one of only" five players to start the first game of their freshman year at Pitt.

Volleyball team in good company

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball
team travels to Provo, Utah this
weekend to take on the strongest
field this side of the NCAA Final
Four.

In addition to the Lady Pan-
thers, the field in the inaugural
Regional Challenge Cup will con-
sist of the third-ranked Universi-
ty of Pacific team as well as
sixth-ranked Texas and the host,
eighth-ranked BYU.

The concept behind the tourna-
ment is to invite four teams that
are ranked number one in their
region. This year, the Lady Pan-
thers will represent the East while
Pacific, Texas and BYU will
represent the West, South and
Northwest, respectively.

On Friday evening, Pitt will
take on the Lady Tigers from Pa-
cific. This should be a real cat
fight as the Lady Tigers have won
the NCAA Championship twice
in the last three years (1985 and
1986) and appear to be of that
caliber this year.

The Lady Tigers will be led by
Brooke Herrington, a veteran
player with Junior National Team
and World University Games ex-
perience, who is considered one
of the premier outside hitters in
the country.

Despite Pacific's lofty ranking,
Pitt coach Shelton Collier feels
his team has a great opportunity.

’’If we play great, weca.n be in
a position to pull off a major up-
set. On a good day, Denise
Frawley can outplay Herrington
and some of the other players will
have to have great matches, too,”

observed Collier.

On Saturday the host, Lady
Cougars from BYU, will supply
the competition for the Lady Pan-
thers. Led by dominant Dylann
Duncan, a 6—foot—4 inch middle-
blocker, BYU is considered a
legitimate Final Four contender.

Duncan played on the Junior
National Team last summer,
which was coached by Pitt's head
coach. Collier feels that ex-
perience could be an asset for his
Pitt team.

”I am aware she [Duncan] does
have some weaknesses. Hopeful-
ly, we will be able to exploit
them,” he noted.

The other team in the tourna-
ment is the Lady Longhorns from
the University of Texas. Pitt has
played the Lady ’Horns three
times in the '80s. In 1981, the
Lady Panthers beat Texas in a
hotly—contested five—game match
with the final game going to Pitt
19-1 7.

In 1982, Texas defeated the
Lady Panthers on their way to the
National Championship. The last
time the two teams met, the Lady
‘Horns won in three highly-
spirited games by the scores of
15-13, 15-13, and 15-12.

When the Lady Panthers take
the court in Provo, they will be
in an unaccustomed position —
as decided underdogs. Collier,
ever the optimist, sees this not as
a problem but as an opportunity.

Pitt has received some Top 20
consideration this year, but not
enough .to break into the
rankings.

According to Collier, ”A win in
this tournament would definitely
vault us into the Top 20.

“This tournament is a great ex-
perience for our seniors, Denise
Frawley and Nora Mulvihill. And
it is great experience for our fresh-
men and sophomores as they're
developing; they are playing top-
level matches,” he added.

In the event Pitt does not pull
off an upset, Collier feels the tour-
nament could still pay off in fu-
ture dividends. He feels that a
young Lady Panther team could
develop as a unit enough to beat
other top teams on their schedule
with the experience gained this

weekend.

The three teams Pitt will be try-
ing to gun down this weekend
are three of the finest women’s
volleyball programs in the coun-
try. They have the kind of finan-
cial resources that the Pitt
volleyball program can only
dream about.

Despite that, the Lady Panthers
will be armed and dangerous. It
will be ”High Noon” on the
court and Frawley will be out to
enhance her reputation as the
fastest gun in the East.

Three on tourney team

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

After losing four starters from a
team that went 37-6 last year, it
was essential that the Pitt wom-
en's volleyball team get off to a
good start this season.

At the Ball State Classic last
week, the Lady Panthers got off
to that good start, thanks in a
large part to the play of Denise
Frawley, Dee MacAulay and Kel-
Iy Matheis.

Pitt brought out the broom in
sweeping both Indianapolis
University and Illinois State in
three games, enabling the Lady
Panthers to capture the champi-
onship.

AI|—American candidate
Frawley was named MVP of the

V tournament despite participating

only in the Illinois State match.
She provided a great deal of
leadership for a young Pitt team,
as well as displaying her awe-
some hitting ability.

The precocious MacAulay was
selected to the All—Tournament
Team. As a freshman, MacAulay
has played an integral role for the
Lady Panthers, being responsible
for serve reception.

"Serve receiving is the most
difficult skill to excel at in volley-
ball and Dee has made a real sig-
nificant contribution,” noted Pitt
coach Shelton Collier.

While her coach feels she plays
an important role for Pitt at
present, in the future he feels
MacAulay can develop into a
great college player.

The third member of the Lady
Panthers to make All-Tournament
was junior outside hitter Matheis,
who has shown dramatic im-
provement in her three seasons at
Pitt.

As a freshman, Matheis saw
very little court time. By the time
her sophomore year rolled
around, she had improved sub-

stantially, to the point of being a \\‘g

set to pull
upset wins

I have a confession to make.
Had I written a column for The
Pitt News orientation issue listing
a preseason college football Top
10, my No. 1 team would have
been the Iowa Hawkeyes. That’s
right, the same Hawkeyes who
lost last weekend to that Western
Athletic Conference power, the
Hawaii Rainbows.

Folks, let me tell you, Hawaii
is a bad football team. Fer cryin’
out loud, Northern Iowa would
probably give them all they could
handle. Chalk one up for the
charms of Hawaii's sun and surf
and the effects they apparently
had on the Hawkeyes.

could turn out to be a nightmare
for the Nittany Lions. Virginia has
its best team in years, and Penn

with the loss of Blair Thomas for

This year, she has continued

Collier summed it up best
when he said, ’’Kelly is one of the

through her perseverance and de-

Graf, Evert
Wilander
advance
in Open

By Rick Warner

AP Tennis Writer

NEW YORK (AP) — Zina Gar-
rison, winless in 21 previous
matches against Martina
Navratilova, ended her bid for
a third straight U.S. Open title
Wednesday with a 6-4, 6-7
(3-7), 7-5 victory in the quar-
terfinals.

Earlier, top-seeded Steffi
Graf breezed into the semifi-
nals while Chris Evert, Gabrie-
la Sabatini and Mats Wilander
rallied for come-from-behind
victories.

Garrison, the 11th seed,
blew five match points in the
second set before eliminating
Navratilova, the second seed
who failed to reach the semi-
finals for the first time since
1982.

Garrison, a 24-year-old from
Houston, advanced to the
semifinals for the first time.

Graf won her 33rd straight
match and moved to within
two victories of completing a
Grand Slam with a 6-3, 6-0
victory over No. 14 Katerina
Maleeva of Bulgaria.

Ma|eeva’s older sister, sixth-
seeded Manuela, lost a two-
hour baseline duel to Evert
3-6, 6-4, 6-2, while Wilander
beat Emilio Sanchez of Spain
3-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-0, 6-4.

Sabatini, the fifth seed, beat
16th-seeded Larisa Savchenko
of the Soviet Union 4-6, 6-4,
6-1.

Evert, seeded third, was
down a set and a break before
rallying to reach the semifinals
for the 17th time in 18 years.

Wilander, the No. 2 men's
seed, turned his match around.
by winning the second-set
tiebreaker. Sanchez had a set
.point at 6-5, but he made three
straight groundstroke errors
that allowed Wilander to even
the match.

Tyson's manager, Bill Cayton,
meanwhile, confirmed on Wed-
nesday that the fighter’s actress
wife, Robin Givens, and her
mother have urged Tyson to see
a Manhattan psychiatrist
described as an expert on athlet-
ic stress.

Cayton, however,
hasn't talked to Tyson for nearly
two weeks. He said he was
prevented from visiting Tyson in
the hospital by Givens, her
mother Ruth Roper and Tyson's
new publicity agent, Howard
Rubenstein.

It was apparent that, while Ty-
son was recovering from a con-
cussion sustained last Sunday
when his car ran into a tree, a rift

between the Givens group and ».

the boxing group that includes
Cayton and trainer Kevin Rooney
was widening.

”Without me, there'd be no
Mike Tyson,” Cayton said. ”And
suddenly, these people are in-
terested in his welfare, and I'm
not. I am outraged.”

The New York Daily News on

said he ‘i

Wednesday quoted unnamedtl

sources close to Tyson as saying
the heavyweight champ told his
wife he was going to kill himself,
then got into his car and ran it
purposely into a tree in Catskill,
N.Y., where he trains. Doctors
said Tyson sustained a concus-
sion and amnesia and was un-
conscious for about a half hour.

Tyson originally was taken to a
local hospital, then transferred to
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center in New York City, where
he remained on Wednesday.

The Daily News story also ac-
cused Cayton and Rooney of be-
ing more concerned that an Oct.
22 title defense against Frank Bru-
no was postponed indefinitely
than they were about Tyson's
health. Givens, Roper, Ruben-
stein and Tyson's two lawyers,
Peter Parcher and Steven Hayes,
were described as those truly
concerned with the fighter’s
welfare.

”This is disgusting, false,” Cay-
ton said. ”|t’s a pack of false-
hoods and untruths — despicable
lies.”

Cayton joined Roper and Ty-
son's surrogate mother, Camille
Ewald, as saying they did not be-

own life. The 82-year-old Ewald,
an in-law of Tyson's first trainer,

Bray earns starting

ﬁnebacker

spot for

Pitt against Ohio State

(AP) — Pitt freshman linebacker
Curtis Bray, who underwent ar-
throscopic knee surgery last
month, has been promoted to first
team and probably will start Sept.
17 against Ohio State.

Pitt probably will start two
freshman linebackers, Bray and
Ricardo McDonald, against the
Buckeyes. McDonald started at
strongside linebacker in Pitt's
59-10 victory over Northern Iowa
last Saturday but has been moved
to the weakside to make room for
Bray. .

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried said
sophomore Prentiss Wright, who
started against Northern Iowa,
has been demoted to second-
team linebacker.

”[Bray] is a very intelligent
kid,” Gottfried said. ”Both he and
Ricardo have picked it up well.
They each fit the spot they are in
much better.”

”Ricardo and I learned both
positions,” said Bray, who is from
Gateway High School in subur-
ban Pittsburgh. ”l’ve switched
back and forth so many times it
doesn't make any difference.”

Pitt linebacker coach Sal Sun-
seri said the 6—foot—4, 225—pound
Bray ”is something special.

Goodness knows he can do it,
physically.”

McDonald, who had one tack-
le against Northern Iowa, will
play the weakside slot manned
by Zeke Gadson when he set a
school record with 24‘/2 quarter-
back sacks last season.
McDonald will be given more
freedom to blitz in his new po-
sition.

”There are a lot of blitzes com-
ing from that side,” he said. ’’It
will free me up.” I

Pitt has an open date this
weekend.

Meanwhile, backup fullback
Jeff Christy, who had arthroscop-
ic knee surgery Aug. 19, has
returned to practice and will
challenge punter Yusef Washing-
ton. Christy was the backup pun-
ter Iast year to John Rasp, who
recently left the team. Washing-
ton averaged only 27 yards a
punt last week.

Gottfried said freshman run-
ning back Curvin Richards, who
had a 47-yard touchdown run in
the opener, has moved ahead of
freshman Ricky Turner as the
second—team tailback behind
Adam Walker.

Eric Metcalf, a running back at
Texas, was declared ineligible to
play in the season opener against
Brigham Young tonight after ac-
cepting money from the
university.

Metcalf reportedly was to en-
roll in summer classes but
changed his mind. The athletic
department had allotted money
to Metcalf to pay for the classes,
and although the funds were ap-

parently returned, the transaction ,

was in violation of NCAA rules.
It is not a violation for a school

to pay for a full-scholarship ath—'

lete to attend summer classes, but
it is in direct violation should the

athlete in question not register for
those classes.

The school has appealed the
decision to the NCAA Eligibility
Committee.

0 Another Heisman candidate,
Blair Thomas of Penn State, has
not fully recovered from surgery
to his right knee, and it is doubt-

ful he will play at all this season,
for the Nittany Lions. Although

Pitt fans are probably happy that
Thomas won't be in the PSU
backfield this season, it's a shame
that his talent might go to waste.

0 If the Steelers can defeat the
defending World Champion
Washington Redskins in this
weekend's NFL matchup, it might

be a sign of good things to come.

The Steelers, you'll recall, lost
a two—touchdown, first-quarter
lead and the game to the Skins in
a preseason game. Retribution
would do quite a bit for the Steel-
ers’, and particularly Bubby
Brister’s, confidence.

0 The Pirates will salute the ac-
complishments of the 1948
Homestead Grays, the last team
to win the championship of the
Negro League, this Saturday night

Clarence Bruce, father of Pitt
women's basketball coach Kirk
Bruce, was a member of that

Putzier fails Steelers’ physical

(AP) — The Pittsburgh Steelers
signed wide receiver Troy John-
son, who was recently waived by
the Phoenix Cardinals, and an-
nounced Wednesday that free
agent defensive lineman Rollin
Putzier failed his physical.

The 6-foot-4, 279-pound Putzi-
er, from Oregon, was the Green
Bay Packers’ fourth-round draft
pick but was waived last month.
He signed with the Steelers on
Tuesday, contingent on passing
his physical.

" Johnson, 25, a former Southern
University athlete, will take the
roster spot of veteran fullback
Frank Pollard, who was placed

on the injured reserve list with an
inflamed right knee.

Johnson had 29 receptions for
511 yards and two touchdowns
in two NFL seasons after playing
one year with the USFL’s Denver
Gold. He signed with Phoenix af-
ter catching only one pass at
Southern, where he specialized
in track. He has been timed at
6.03 seconds in the 60—meter
dash and 4.28 seconds in the
40-yard dash.

The Steelers now have five
wide receivers on their 47-man
roster: Johnson, Louis Lipps,
Weegie Thompson, Joey C|ink—

scales and Charles Lockett.

The Steelers had planned to put
defensive lineman Lorenzo Free-
man on injured reserve, but they
will keep him on their roster. He
will be one of the two players
deactivated for Sunday's game at
Washington.

Cornerback Dwayne Wood-
ruff, who missed the Cowboys
game, also won't play against the
Redskins because of a hamstring
injury. Linebacker Gregg Carr is
doubtful (sore ankle), while line-
backer Bryan Hinkle (calf) and
strong safety Cornell Gowdy (in-
jured thumb) are probable.

Merriweather bluffing?

son, according to his agent.

’’I think it's over with,” said
agent Mike Blatt. ”l advised
Mike of that. My gut feeling is,
it's over with. That's not a
bluff, that's reality.”

The Steelers have been try-
ing to minimize Mer-
riweather’s loss by using their
No. 1 draft pick, Aaron Jones,
as both an outside linebacker
and a down lineman.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 8, 1988

The voice of Misfits and Samhain rings on

By Tim Azinger
For the Pitt News

Glenn Danzig has to be the
most appropriate synonym for
foreboding evil. The master of
macabre is back at it again, after
a long silent period, with a new
band and a slightly different
sound.

Danzig’s name became well-
known among the punk culture
around the late '70s, when his
first band, the Misfits, were just
breaking into the scene.

The Misfits put out a total of
seven 7" EPs, the Beware 12" EP,
released only in the U.K. and the
Danzig 7" EP release of Who
Killed Marilyn before ever releas-
ing any full length LPs.

Walk Among Us was their first,
and although originally only
35,000 to 37,000 were pressed,

Danzig re-released it in August of
1988. The re-release contains all
the original horror tunes, includ-
ing the live ”Mommy, Can I Go
Out And Kill Tonight?/’ but the
sound quality is much better than
the original. The 1988 Walk
Among Us also includes a lyric
sheet, which makes comprehend-
ing Danzig’s bane crooning
much easier.

The Wolfsblood/Earth A.D. LP
came next, followed by the Evi-
live 12”. Evilive contains live ver-
sions of most of the Walk Among
Us tracks and three previously
unreleased tunes: ”Horror
Hotel,” ”Ghouls Night Out” and
”We Are 138.” Henry Rollins,
former Black Flag leader, -lends a
hand on the vocals for ”We Are
138.” 0

The Die, Die My Darling 12'’
EP was the last release by the Mis-

fits while they were still together.
Since the demise of the band in
1983, Danzig has released two
more Misfits compilations. The
first was the Best of the Misfits
CD, which includes 20 songs
from various Misfits’ albums and
EPs. It is still in” press. Also
released and still in press is the
Legacy of Brutality LP, which is
composed mostly of previously
unreleased songs.

Danzig’s next excursion was
his Samhain project. Samhain,
which means ”the season of the
dead,” the Druidic term for Hal-
loween, was what Danzig had
envisioned the Misfits as becom-
ing if they had stayed together
and matured musically.

Samhain’s sound is a bit slow-
er and heavier than that of the
Misfits, and the lyrics seem more

intelligently done and more

thought-provoking. All three
Samhain releases — the Initium
LP, the Unholy Passion 12" EP,
and the November—Coming—F/"re
LP, are still in press.

Samhain was shorter lived than
the Misfits, and since they've dis-
banded, Danzig has been virtu-
ally unheard from until now, the
only exception being a very
melodious tune by Glenn Danzig
and the Power and Fury Orches-
tra on the Less Than Zero
soundtrack.

With his new band, appropri-
ately tagged Danzig, and the new
album of the same name, he has
taken his musical maturation one
step further. Since the beginning
of his career, it has been evident
that Danzig was not simply
another hardcore screamer, and
his intense vocal renderings are
best displayed on his latest work.

A

One of the most shocking
differences is the appearance of
the band. While they are still
decked out in their black leather
garb, longer hair is now also part
of the band's image. Even Dan-
zig himself is lacking his trade-
mark ”devil lock,” keeping it
pushed off to the side.

Danzig and bassist Eerie Von
are the only two members that re-
main from Samhain. Newcomer
guitarist John Christ and former
Black Flag/DOA/Circle Jerks
drummer Chuck Biscuits round
out the group.

The new album was released
on Def American Records and
was produced by Rick Rubin,
most famous for his work with
the Cult.

The Samhain influence is still
very prevalent, especially in the
lyrics, but the sound is a bit more
raw and has a slight reminiscence

of the Cult’s guitar work.

”Twist of Cain” has to be the
most representative of the theme
of the album, that is, Danzig’s be-
lief in the constant battle between
good and evil, the reigning pow-
ers in the universe.

This motif shows itself through-
out the remainderof the album
on such tracks as ”Soul on Fire,”
’’Am 1 Demon,” ”Possession”
and ”Evil Thing.”

While the music is fairly
straightforward, the lyrics are
keenly thought-out and well-
produced. There are no hidden
meanings or catchy cliches, just
the blunt point that Danzig is so
well-known for conveying.

This album will round out any
Misfits/Samhain fanatics’ collec-
tion and should also please those
looking for some new hardcore
with a twist, especially those in-
terested in the Cult.

It had been rumored that Dan-
zig might be touring with Slayer,
and although Danzig has done a
few promo shows in New York,
the plans for a more extensive
tour have yet to be announced.

Pittsburgh Filmmakers: lights, camera, education

By Michele Kiraly
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh Filmmakers boasts a
strange notoriety. Not only does
the city's media arts center offer
classes in photography, film and
video production, it also presents
screenings of foreign and in-
dependently produced American
films and hosts photography ex-
hibits in its gallery.

The hype is that the organiza-
tion operates the city’s smallest
and largest screening rooms. The

48—seat Oakland screening room, ‘

at 205 Oakland Ave., holds the
title of the smallest theater. The
comfortable gray room with a
contrasting large, white screen,
serves as both a classroom and a
theater. Often, visiting filmmak-
ers are on-hand for screenings of
their work. Avant—garde filmmak-
er Alan Berliner will offer a work-
shop on film—editing strategies

‘ and discuss his own work during

a visit to Filmmakers in late
October.

The Fulton Theatre at 101 Sixth
St., Downtown, is a double at-
traction for moviegoers. The vast,
l,500—seat theater also contains
the largest movie screen in town,
thus enabling films to be seen the
way they are supposed to be seen
— on a very wide screen. In Sep-
tember, the Fulton is presenting
two foreign films: Tokyo Olym-
piad, in tune with the summer
games in Seoul, and Babette’s
Feast, a hit at this past summer's

Three Rivers Film Festival.

Pittsburgh Filmmakers was
founded in 1971 as an equip-
ment access center for indepen-
dent media artists. Here,
filmmakers and photographers
could join as members and share
the equipment. Just one year af-
ter its opening, Filmmakers
offered classes in film production
and photography. In 1974, the
Oakland screening room became
the site for screenings of offbeat
films as well as work by members
of Filmmakers. Several years ago,
Filmmakers began presenting for-
eign and independently pro-
duced American films at the
Fulton. Recently, courses in
videotape production have been
added to the organization's long
list of services.

The faculty at Filmmakers is
composed of award-winning ar-
tists who work independently in
television or in industry. The or-
ganization offers over 30 elec-
tives to its students who come
from the University of Pittsburgh
in the film studies program, Point
Park College, where a film major
is offered, Carnegie Mellon and
Carlow College. Classes can be
taken for college credit or in-
dependently.

Courses in film production
range from Filmmaking I through
IV and Videotape Production I
and II. Key production courses
are also taught in which students

do not make films but learn other ,

essential skills like directing, film
editing, screen writing, sound for
film and cinematography/light-
ing. All equipment is provided by
Filmmakers, but students pay for
their own film and processing.

This fall, a new class is offered:
Producing for Film and Video.
Course instructor Peter Argentine
is national programming
producer for WQED television
station. The class will explore the
responsibilities of a producer in
a wide range of production situ-
ations. ”This course is offered to

‘Internships and

advanced filmmaking students in
order for them to become better
acquainted wth the business,
promoting and legal aspects of
fi|mmaking,” said Brady Lewis,
department head of film
production.

Photography classes include
Black & White Photography I and
II and Color Photography I and II.
independent
studies are also offered in film
and photography.

Often, plain curiosity about
filmmaking is enough to make a
person enroll in Filmmaking I, the
first film production course. This
fact probably explains why the in-
troductory film courses are the
most popular at Filmmakers.

”Many people who take Film- «

making I have unrealistic ideas
about the production process,”
said Lewis. ”It’s not as easy as
they would expect, and they real-
ize that making a movie is a lot
of work.” i

In Filmmaking I, students make
three or four short super—8 films.
The class is composed of exer-

cises and drills. ”We try to cover
the basics and pack a lot of
material into this course. We try
to familiarize the students with
the equipment,” Lewis added.
Students work in the silent film
format in Film I.

The student's basic knowledge
is put to work in the production
of one film during the term in
Filmmaking II. The course em-
phasizes technical quality and ar-
tistic conception. Students work
more rigorously in Film II, where
they are exposed to sound and
16mm production. They learn
about the professional proce-
dures of 16mm production but
work in the amateur 8mm format,
since it's less expensive.

Filmmaking III is the first 16mm
production course. This type of
filmmaking is more expensive
than super—8, but working in
16mm offers greater technical
possibilities and students have
more of a chance of distributing
their films. Advanced 16mm
production is taught in Filmmak-
ing IV.

Introduction to Videotape
Production is a hands-on work-
shop for both the serious student
and the beginning professional.
Students learn basics like camera
operation and tape editing, and
they work on group exercises.

Class projects range from com-
mercials to documentaries in
Videotape Production II. This
course gives students a step-by-
step approach to shooting and
editing a single camera, film-style
video production.

Black & White Photography I
and Color Photography I are
designed to give an understand-

ing of the technical and aesthet-
ic implications of photography as
a fine art.

These are production courses
in which students learn the
process of seeing (making an ex-
posure) and the craftmanship
(making a photographic print),
which are the fundamental
aspects of photography.

Advanced courses in Black &
White and Color Photography are
also offered this semester.

Filmmakers’ services are not
limited to classroom instruction
and film presentations. During

It you have been disappointed chasing the loudspeaker rainbow, Opus
One has a pot of gold on sale. Music critics, friends, salespeople, and you,
know that the most important part of a stereo system is the loudspeaker. To
improve your sound, you look for better speakers. You search all the stores ‘
and read all the ads (including classifieds). You even listen to hucksters
selling great speaker promises from their vans and car trunks.

Few companies make great speakers, even fewer are able to make a
great speaker at a low price. BOSTON ACOUSTICS is an exception to this rule.

oThe Boston Acoustics A-60 bookshelf speaker has been knocking the

competition dead for the last six years. Most reviewers consider it a best

buy at its regular price of only $230.00 per pair.

oThe Boston Acoustics Al 00 is regarded by most experts as the best value

in a moderately priced full size speaker at $420.00 per pair.

These and other models of the Boston Acoustics are now on sale at all
Opus One stores! Remember when something you really want to own is on
sale — that is a true bargain! And remember -— it you find a locally
advertised price lower than ours during this sale, Opus One will match it or

even beat it!

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 8, T988

A Steel Pulse will beat on Flagstaff Hill

By Michelle Kleinsak

For The Pitt News

Steel Pulse, the reggae band
from Jamaica, will be performing
on the campus of Carnegie Mel-
lon University this Sunday.

The band’s debut album for
MCA records, State of Emergen-
cy, unites their brand of modern
reggae with their own personal
political convictions.

Band members David Hinds
(vocals, rhythm guitar), Selwyn
”Bumbo” Brown (vocals, key-
boards), Alphonso Martin (vocals,
percussion), Steve ”Grizzly” Nis-
bett (drums) and Alvin Ewen
(bass) were looking for a sound
with a more worldwide feel on
this LP. ”Reaching Out,” a
calypso—flavored tune, is the first
single from State of Emergency.

Hinds feels that the album is
contemporary. ”We've tried to
keep the music as modern as pos-
sible, with different sounds and
chord progressions, more than
the basic reggae musical struc-
tures. We're going for a sound
that will appeal to new au-
diences, especially in America.”

Steel Pulse has been challeng-
ing themselves since their forma-
tion in Birmingham, England, in
1975.

”We got the idea to form a
band, especially after hearing
Bob Marley's Catch A Fire al-
bum,” Hinds recalled. ”We start-
ed rehearsing once a week up in
my parent's attic, mostly doing
cover versions of songs by groups
like the lsley Bros. and War, as
well as reggae artists like Marley

9 and Burning Spear.”

The group's first single, ”Kibu—
da, Mansetta and Abuku,” was
released on a small independent
label in 1976. Alphonso Martin
and Steve Nisbett joined the band
in '77 when they started to hit the
London club scene. Steel Pulse
gained a reputation as a crossover
band through sharing bills with
punk groups like Generation X
and The Stranglers as well as
other reggae groups.

The band signed with Island
Records, and a string of well-
received LPs followed: Hands-
worth Revolution (1978), Tribute
to the Martyrs (1979) and Reggae
