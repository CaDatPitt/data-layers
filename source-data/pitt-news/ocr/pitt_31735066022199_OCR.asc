Greek
mixer
endsin

blood bath

By Marc Duchin
Adored By The News Editors

What began as an innocent,
friendly Greek mixer for Pi Kap-
pa Alpha fraternity and Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority ended in
a bloody brawl for high stakes,
according to Brendan Walsh, a
brother at PIKA.

’’I don't know how it exactly
got started,” said Walsh. ”We
were sitting around the television,
watching Highway to Heaven,
sipping herbal tea, listening toJim
Nabors, when we just started
talking about Trojan gladiators.”

According to Walsh, an argu-
ment broke out between the
fraternity and sorority when the
sorority insisted that any one of
its members could be victorious
in hand—to-hand‘ combat. The
fraternity strongly disagreed and
responded loudly with foul lan-
guage and obscene gestures to
the sorority. _

The argument continued for
the next 20 minutes, until. the
sorority challenged the fraternity
to a series of one-on-one fights.

It was agreed that. the overall win-
ner would be the organization
with the most individual victo-
ries. All members of the losing or-
ganization were obligated to
forfeit their next semester's tuition
money to the winners.

Walsh went on to say that the

rules stated that a member could
only fight once and that weapons
were not allowed. For a member
to be declared a winner, he or
she must render his or her oppo-
nent unconscious fora minimum
of two minutes.

VOLUME LOUD, ISSUE MOOT

Student Government

linked to

By Teresa Candori _
Probably Beautiful In A Former Life

Investigation into allegations of
a secret Student Government
Board slush fund has revealed an
entire network of illegal activities
including drug trafficking and a
subsequent cover—up.

Phil Moyer, president of the
SGB, said, ”Since I am president
of the SGB and, therefore,

‘ spokesman for the entire student

government, I must take full
responsibility for everything that
goes on in this office. As for alle-
gations of illegal activities among
the student government, I must
say that whoever said that has
overstepped their bounds.”

According to anonymous
sources, the SGB’s involvement
in drug trafficking was the impe-
tus behind George Kontos’ resig-
nation as president protem.
Asked why he chose to remain
on the board, Kontos said, ”l
don't disagree with what they're
doing, only with the way they're
doing it.” 9

Sources confided that Kontos
resented Moyer’s disproportion-
ately large share of_ the profits.

The source. went on to reveal
that the annual SGB retreat was

drug ring

actually a drug run to South
America, funded by your student
activities fee.

Further information, obtained
by sneaking around, illegally tap-
ping the SGB office and phones
and just being plain, al|—around
nosey, has shown that the ’’plan-
ning session” held before each
SGB meeting is in actuality a full-
scale drug orgy.

in defiance of the Gag Rule, Al-
locations Committee Chairperson

Karen Bohichik said, ”We [the

committee] recommended that
funding for the drug runs to South
America be denied, but the board
rejected our recommendation.
Phil's responsible for everything

that goes on up here; it's all his _

fault.”

Upon being informed of the
findings, former SGB president
Jim Mumma declared, ”|t’s just
something The Pitt News is mak-
ing up to discredit the SGB.
They're just a bunch of irrespon-
sible sensationaliststrying to ruin

our image.” v

Rumors that the illegal a_cti.vi-.I- 
ties had begun during Mumma’s
tenure in office could not be con-

firmed, but The Pitt News urges

students to- believe it “anyway.” T

Pos var lea ves post to pursue pro wrestling career

By Jim Urban
Four Years Of College, One Notebook

University of Pittsburgh Presi-
dent Dr. Wesley Posvar shocked
the Oakland campus late Tues-
day when he announced that he
is taking a leave of absence from
the university to pursue a career
in professional wrestling.

’’It is something I have always

wanted to try,” the 61-year-old
Posvar saidin a prepared state-
ment. ”-l’ve spent many a Sunday
morning listening to Vince and

’The Body,_’ always thinking that .

someday they could be talking
about me.”

Posvar wasted no time getting
started, either. He signed im-
mediately with the World
Wrestling Federation manager
Bobby ”The Brain” Heenan.

His first bout is on the under-
card of Wrestlemania IV against
Nigerian Olesegun Obasanjo for
the Intercontinental Champi-
onship.

”He’s a big guy,” Posvar said,
coughing frequently, ’’but I am
quicker and faster. I think I can

Obasanjo was seated just to the

Experts looking on also agreed
that perhaps Posvar is biting off
a bit more than he can chew in

his first attempt at ‘professional

”l see the man having no“

THE PITT SNOOZE, Wednesday, April I, I987

SGB President Moyer implicated in tape-erasing

Phil Moyer will have to face
what may be the biggest blow to
his political career yet. Moyer
and several other SGB members
have be implicated in a tape-
erasing scandal that could seri-
ously affect every student on the
campus.

Moyer and his accomplices,
whose names have yet to be
released, were caught erasing
Genesis, Talking Heads and Bon
Jovi tapes at Oasis Records and
Tapes.

According to an inside source,
Moyer and his accomplices were
also responsible for the erasure of
tapes at National Record Mart
and Tapes on the girls’ floors in
Tower A last Monday.

”I heard that they were going
to hit Holland Hall [an al|—girls
dorm] and Record Outlet next. I
couldn't tell you for sure. But I'll
tell you one thing — it would've
been a clean job if Moyer hadn't
accidentally dubbed the tapes
with Brian Ferry music. Those
lounge lizards stick together.”

Mona Lott, a victim of Moyer’s
alleged erasing frenzy, said that

.\\\\x)z\\_\_;;;;_'g;_x\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

’\\\V\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

 

this has been a difficult time for
her.

”I came to my room right after
class, and I put in my Bon Jovi
tape, and all of a sudden, I heard
‘Slave to Love.’ I almost puked,
you know.”

Reportedly, several SGB mem-
bers are expected to hand in their
resignations by the end of the
week. Moyer, however, has de-
nied any involvement in the
scheme. ”I am not a crook,” said
Moyer.

Cartoonist Condron is
Spiro—graph addict

Pitt News cartoonist Todd Con-
dron was rushed to the Betty Ford
Center after he drew too many
geometrical designs with his
Spiro—graph set and consequent-
ly became dizzy and nauseated
from overexposure to the designs.

”He was a real basket case,”
said a city parmedic. ”We have
been witnessing more and more
cases of this type of addiction. It's
a real shame. These young,
talented artists, faced with the

thought of actually selling their
work, turn to Spiro—graph. Sure,
it takes their minds off things for
a while, but then they crash. And
that's when we come in.”

Condron, who was arrested last
March for possession of the ille-
gal contraband, said it all began
when he was feeling depressed
after failing a chemistry exam.

”A friend of mine brought over
a Spiro—tot set. I thought that I
could quit anytime. Then I want-
ed it more and more. So I got into
the heavy stuff — Spiro—graph.
When people say Spiro—graph
isn't addictive, they lie,’’ said
Condron.

Angry
lobster

attacks
newsroom

By Jim Urban

He Likes To Have Fun

Claiming that crustaceans all
over the world have been dis-
criminated against, a lobster at-
tacked The Pitt News last night,
destroying the newspaper's
$64,000-computer system.

’’It was terrible,” said News

- Editor Kathy Stahl. ’’I haven't
._ seen anything that terrifying since
; I had that in—growntoenail cut out
5 with a steak knife last summer.”

The lobster, believed to be a
native of Maine, is described as
being slen‘der, red and delicious.

He escaped authorities late last

night, and Pittsburgh police and

the city river patrol are currently

on alert. _
”We knew there was some-
thing fishy about this character

   

when he first came into town,”

said Pittsburgh policeman» Joe _

Bagadonuts. ”That is why we
were not surprised when he put
the pinch on that newspaper last
night.”

The police have even gone as
far as to enlist the help of noted
oceanography expert Dr. Ellis
Strick, an instructor at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

”He must know his stuff, and
he must be one heckuva
teacher,” Bagadonuts said.

”From what we hear, all the stu-
dents get As in his oceanography

Security cameras caught the lobster in the act of sabotage.

class. He must be doing some-
thing right.”

Reportedly, at Strick’s instruc-
tions, policemen all over the city
have been boiling water. They
want to be ready should the re-
bel crustacean suddenly be ap-

, prehended.

’’I’d like to handle this matter
personally,” Bagadonuts added,
holding a stick of butter and a le-
mon in his hands.

Last night's attack was the first

of its kind by a lobster in a long
while.

BAS parody nipped
right in the bud  

By Teresa Candori
Waiting Patiently To Be discovered

The Pitt News announced to-
day that their special April Fools’
Day Parody Issue would not in-
clude a story about the Black Ac-
tion Society.

”We thought about it for a long
time,” said Editor’-In-Chiefjim Ur-
ban. ”We wanted to include
them in all the good—natured fun,
but we didn't want to offend
them, either. We looked up all
the precedents on libel cases and
parody, and we_ figured we'd be
safe writing a story saying that we
wouldn't be writing a story.”

News Editor Kathy Stahl added,
”They’re not really pleased with
the coverage we've given their
elections, so we figured, why ag-

- gravate the situation?”

Stahl confirmed that she would
continue her work on the BAS

» elections story, and she did not

want her investigation to be
colored by anything tasteless and
offensive.

Urban said, ”We’ve been criti-
cized by the BAS in the past, and
we thought we'd play it safe by
not parodying them.”

Media Adviser Wilferd Trem-
blay said in a prepared statement,
’’I have faith in the staff not to
write anything that would get
them or the paper into any kind
of legal trouble. I would hope
that all student groups would
view the parody issue in the spirit
it was intended.” ’ .

Editor-ElectJohn.Enright said it
wasn't his problem and pointed
out that his term doesn't begin
until next month.

”For now, I'm still sports edi-
tor, and if it's not in sports, what
do I care?”

BAS officials declined com-
ment and plan to release an offi-
cial statement next week. I

Pay them editors

Recently, there were rumors of a pay raise for The Pitt News
staff floating around the office. To all of the students currently
employed there, it came as a shock.

According to statements none of them made, they were fair-
ly contented with the amount of money they received and with
the considerable supplement of pride inherent in producing
such a fine piece of workmanship as this.

In short, they were happy.

But then this idea of a pay raise hit them, and they haven't
been the same since. They thought it might be fun to have some
extra money.

Then, they could get a bar installed at the office. They could
have pizza delivered more often. They could be a lot happier‘
with a little more money. And so they got to thinking about
it. What, they thought, was a little more money? Who would
notice another few hundred dollars a year?

The government sends millions to the Contras, and the edi-
tors thought that they could maybe get a little of that White
House basement loot for themselves.

So, in effect, this is a statement that the editorial board of
The Pitt News supports a pay raise for same. They've thought
about it, given it some deep consideration actually, and they've
decided that it would really be all right with them if they got‘
some more money — preferably before the beginning of next
month. There is always the possibility that they'll be getting
called home if they don't get some cash. I

Legislating my morality

Hello, children. Welcome to
Mr. Mora|ity’s nieghborhood. To-
day, we're going to be talking
about the role of government in
the game of morality.

Can you say ."mora|ity”? Sure,
I thought you could.

I'm going to ask you some
questions, and you're going to
respond "right" or "wrong."
Easy, huh?

' First question: Can the courts
legislate morality? Can they tell
us what to think of as wrong?

Sorry, the answer to that one
was wrong. See, if the courts can
tell us what to do, and the courts
are supported by our taxes, we
have essentially sold them our

— rights to make decisions. It's like '

prostituting your integrity for
some comfortable peace of mind.
Not to mention the comfort in
having an army standing ready to
annihilate anyone who happens
to think differently. Like the Com-
munists, those dirty creeps.
Oh, but wait a minute. The
government does some good
things, they help us out a lot, and
isn't obeying the rules what we

have -to do to enjoy the benefits

of society? Remember all those
people who died for our
freedom? 4
Ah, that's a tough question. ,
I guess if we don't like what

America and the Christians have

to offer, we’re'free to leave, huh? ,

We can all pack our ungrateful
asses up and hit the road if we
don't like it here.

Something to think about, for
sure.

Read the Constitution.
Rememeber that old document,
you know,‘ the one some guys
wearing wigs wrote about 200
years ago? On the thick yellow
paper? Sure, that's the one.

I may be really wrong, but I
certainly don't remember any-
thing in there about the govern-
ment's right to suppress anything,
to be closed to any change. That's
the whole beauty of the thing. If
we think there's anything wrong
with the way things are being
done, anything at all, we're free
to say what we think, write about
it even. We can fight for it as hard
as we want, so long_ as we stay
within the limits of our laws. -

See, the whole problem seems
to be one of narrow-mindedness.
"Oh, boy, what's this jerk talking
about now?" You might ‘ask.

We, as people, seem to have
this nasty habit of thinking that

we might have the right answers,’

ty convinced that evolution was
the figment of some really
screwed-up minds. Of course it
was.

I really don't know why we ‘T

think we might ‘be right about
anything. In all, we have a pretty
dismal record of havingany of

"our theories, about science,

government, ethics, anything,
really, proved right. We, as a
race, have always been wrong
before.

In short, we should probably all
just think for ourselves and not be
willing to "sell our psyc'-hes" _for
the relative comfort of somebody
else's morals. It may be easier to
accept the product of someone
elses thinking, but in the process,
we have forfeited any chance we
might have had to change for the
better. We are not the limit of the

productive to think so, it reallyis -

stupid.

thought about something else. As
if it matters what I think about.
On the way to school, an old

a living. I didn't know. I told her
I was a garbage collector. I
laughed, and she walked away,-
not caringwhat I had told her.
I didn't know it at the time, but
she was looking for happiness. I;

THE PITT SNOOZE, Wednesday, April 1, I987

Gimme
my MTV
before I
cry

When some bimbo tells me I'm
not upscale enough, when I drip
gourmet ice cream on my Guess?
denim jacket, when I bounce six
checks in one week, when the
only mail I get is a bill from
American Express, when the only
food in my apartment is a jar of
Grey Poupon and some tofu and
when I can't decide whether or
not to mix plaids, I can always
turn to something to find solace.

I have my MTV. When I wait-
ed in line to buy Bon Jovi tickets,
only to be turned away, MTV
helped me through a period I
really don't want to talk about.

MTV’s there for me every time.

. things go wrong. It's likehaving

a 24-hour analyst.‘ My MTV
makes my decisionsfor me. My
MTV solves my problems and
runs my life. My MTV, what
would I‘ do without it?

About a year ago, I moved into
my present apartment. The guys
who lived there already had ca-
ble and a color TV. After three
years in the dorms, dorms with
neither of the aforementioned
amenities, I was. desperate for
change.

Anyhow, I came.accross MTV
on the first night in my new apart-
ment. I floated the check I used
to pay my security deposit, and
I was nervous about it. I felt bet-
ter,'watching MTV. My troubles
vanished as I became entranced
by all of the glossy advertising,
driving rythms and the not-so-
subtle messages that urged me to
stop thinking. It was like, really
neat. Kind of like a lobotomy
without the surgery.

That first night spent in the
arms of MTV changed my life.
Whenever I am feeling down on
myself, all I have to do is turn on
MTV. The people on it always
seem so happy. I thought it might
be because of all the snappy
Benetton outfits they wear, so I
went out and spent $65 for a
sweatshirt. My intuition proved to
be right. That sweatshirt made me
an important person — I was
cool, accepted, normal, trendy.
Now I,~ too, wear overpriced
sportswear everyday, and I'm a
better man for it.

Paul Anater is a staff writer from

hell. But he has nice teeth and,

wonderful red hair.

LETTER POLICY I

All letters inended for pub-
lication should be typed on a
single sheet and include the
arthor’s name and univerver-
sity affiliation, if any.

The Pitt News "reserves the
right to delete any portion of
the letter and to even change
what the bloody thing says. If

damn thing.

Thank you.

The Pitt News diet plan

Hey, kids. [It's time to thin
down and get healthy.~Maybe
anemic, who knows. Up here at
the office, after years of careful
and destructive testing, we've
come up with the ultimate col-
lege diet. We call it The Pitt
News Diet, and here it is.

First, throw away all your vita-
mins. Those lousy things won't
do anything but make you feel
good. That's not what The Pitt
News Diet is all about. We want
to feel like hell and look it.’

Here's the typical day for a Diet
adherent.

Breakfast: six cigarettes, three
cups of coffee (minimum), con-
densed class notes (preferably not
your own) and a shot of bourbon
(optional).

Lunch: one can of Coke and a
non-nutritious pseudo snack from
the machines downstairs. More

«It's time for a change.

No longer can we submit to
our average, routine, boring lives.
We must break away from the
barriers of tradition and child-
hood programming. We must
take responsiblity for ourselves.

How, you may ask. Well, we
can begin by taking over the
school.

Pitt's 200th birthday is a sym-
bol of a new beginning, a "cam-
pus of the future.". We are the

future. Therefore, without us’

there is no campus. Pitt needs us.

If we band together and truly
trust one another for the fulfill-
ment of our goals, we can
succeed.

I'm not asking for all students
to storm the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. I propose a non—military

change of leadership to be con— '

trolled solely by the students.
We are intelligent, civilized,
young individuals. No one has to

V get hurt as long as we do this

cigarettes and another shot of
bourbon (not optional).

Snack: three units of liquid
nutrition and courage. Peter's
Pub is recomended. Maybe
Chief's.

Dinner: whatever you can get
someone else to buy for you.
Ideally, dinner should include at
least three of the following: a
medium order of "O" fries, a
burger from one of the fast-food
joints, a pack of cigarettes, a bot-
tle of something, some left-over
cookies (must be stale to be ac-
ceptable), three liberal publica-
tions, a bag of Doritos.

Things to avoid: salad, yoghurt,
anything not containing some
form of burnt, dead animal flesh,
exercise (at all costs), fresh air,
prescription drugs.

Things to rememeber: always
wait until 4 o'clock until eating.
This can be best accomplished by

Batten the hatches, boys!

thing right.

The first thing to be done is for
students to go on strike. If all stu-
dents _don't show up for classes,
thenthey can't miss any work.
We'll be in every magazine,
newspaper and news program
from Houston to Hong Kong.
We'll be the heroes of college
students everywhere-.

The public will assume the
university is at fault; why else
would every student refuse to at-
tend class? University administra-
tion will be forced to negotiate,
and that's when we'll have those
bastards right where we want
them. They'll have no choice but
to meet our demands.

The power of designating
course requirements and class.
time will be left to the leadership
of the students. All faculty and
staff of the university will be hired
or fired as the student leaders see
fit. We'll make up all kinds of
rules as we goalong. Organized

 

staying in bed until 3 and starting
with breakfast then. Regular class
attendance interferes with the
above suggestion and should be
avoided. Besides, it makes you
complacent and fat.

The Pitt News Diet includes ac-
tivities such as: idlegossip, cons-
tant bickering, cramming for
exams, sleep every other night
only, brewing coffee, worrying
about problems we can't possibly
change and thinking about how
to best explain our QPAs.

Have fun, and lousy health to
all. The book detailing the proper
attitudes to make the diet most ef-
fective can be purchased for
$14.95. See any staff member. A

Paul Anater and Matthew
Thornton are irresponsible, snide,
cynical and the editors of the per-

spective section. Yet, they are-Ial-1

ways kind to ferrets. V

       

elections will be held to get those
current sissies out .of student
government and to get some
leaders who aren't afraid of kick-
ing some ass.

An academic institution lives
on reputation. If Pitt loses its stu-
dents, it loses its alumni support,
its future freshman classes and its
funds, and bankruptcy becomes
inevitable.

We have the real power, let's
use it. We just have to be united.

We are the ones future genera-
tions_will read about in their his-
tory books and look back on with
admiration and respect.

Nuns Across America

Sisters express concerns over money extortion rumors  

By Frances Sansig
Office Luster

Sisters from Maine to California
are expected to join hands in an
effort to raise money for homeless
people when ’’Nuns ' Across
America” takes place this
Saturday.

Sister Mary Q. Contrairy, chair-
sister of the event, said that the
hardest part of organizing the
whole affair was deciding who
would compose and sing the
theme song.

”Kenny Rogers was my per-

sonal favorite — we in the con-
vent all take a special liking to
Kenny. But he already did
’Hands.’ Several of the new—wave
sisters suggested Geldof, but you
know he did ’Band-Aid.’ And
then Michael and Lionel. did
’USA for Africa,’ that Cougar guy
and Willie did ’Farm Aid,’ and to
be quite blunt, the only person
we have been able to contact so
far has been Mick Jagger, but he
said he is already involved in a
charity event, saying he will be
marrying Texas supermodel Jer-
ry Hall,” said Contrairy.

”lt’s very exciting,” said Sister
Elizabeth Chong from the Order
of Saint Chadwick nuns. ”We’re
expecting Mayor Caliguiri and
Mr. Rogers. Michelle Madoff said
that she might even show up.
That pleases us.”

According to Sister Margaret
Thatcher (no relation to the Brit-
ish prime ninister), the nuns have

  
 

been plagued with their share of
problems due to the ”Hands”
fiasco.

”We were almost afraid to go
through with it,” said Thatcher
(no relation to the British prime
minister). ”But then we thought,
’Hey, we're nuns! We're the
good guys. Everybody loves
nuns.’ ”

Thatcher said they began a spe-
cial T-shirt and bumper sticker
campaign in an effort to assure
the public that nuns are trustwor-
thy and hip people.

However, an NAA official who
asked to remain anonymous, said
that others should take off their
rosary-colored glasses and smell
the holy water.

"Don't let us fool you — we're
all paranoid. The CIA will be
watching us like a hawk to make

goes to those homeless people.
It's just a shame. They don't trust

God reveals something flaky floating in the air

God revealed to me yesterday that
the snowfall that has been occurring
for the past 80 years or so is actually
made up of about four percent water,
three percent dehydrated Aunt Jemima
Syrup and 93 percent refined cocaine.

”Everyone thinks each snowflake is
different,” he said. ”The fact of the
matter is people are so high on the
stuff they can't tell that snowflakes are
in fact shaped just like Flintstone’s
Chewable Vitamins.”

According to God, that white stuff
left behind on your shoes when you
come inside after walking the snowy
streets is the residue of the cocaine
falling on most parts of the free
world.

’’I was dumping it on the com-
munists for a while but then Breshnev
sprouted those eyebrows, Andropov
lost his hair, and Gorbachev got that
weird little discoloration that ‘looks
like a map of Albania on his head,”
he said. ”lt also affected the hair of
females living there. That's whythey

all wear those ridiculous looking
babushkas.”

God allowed me what has become
a rather unexclusive interview just af-
ter speaking with Oral Roberts on the
death scam he conjured up.

He said the money indeed will not
be going to help television evangelists
in this nation, but rather, will pay for
enough cocaine to last through next
winter's snowfall.

”Supply was down,” he said. ”The
quickest way I could build up stock
was through one of those goofballs. K
Sometimes my own genius surprises
me.”

He said the only bad side—effects he
has seen thus far in this country are:

  

0 The belief that snow tires are
different from any other kind of tire.

0 The bad reaction Ronald Reagan
has had to it since moving east from
California.

0 The belief held by some that rein-
deer can fly.

He said that contrary to popular be-
lief, snow isn't really slippery in the
least. _

’’If you stand outside in the stuff
long enough you begin to think
you're just sliding all over the place,”
he said. ”People who think they're
skiing, sled-riding or skidding on the
highways aren't really moving at all.
Some haven't even gotten further than
out their front doors. They just think
they remember it.”

He said he believes the ski lift to be
his biggest money—maker in terms of
net profit.

”There aren't really any ski lifts in
the world,” he said. ”|t’s just a bunch
of park benches out in the middle of
a field.”

It's your last course in economics, and there's no
‘‘final'’. Only the keys to a brand new Chevy. Thanks

God said the only reason the Green
Bay Packers ever won a football game
was the fact that other teams weren't
adjusted to the potent snow fall in
Minnesota.

’’It was the same thing with the
Steelers,” he said. ”The only reason
they won four Super Bowls was be-
cause‘ my stuff mixed with the exhaust
from steel mills.”

He pointed out that Terry Bradshaw
lost his hair because he went to col— g
lege in Louisiana and reacted badly to
the stuff.

”Look at how bad they've been
since the mills began closing,” he
said. ’’It was all just a chemical
reaction.”

He said he plans to continue using
the stuff and told me there won't be
world peace until the yearly snowfall
stops. ‘

I guess in the end there's no point
in complaining about the weather af-
ter all.

News officials suspected in sixth floor burglary 

By Kathy Stall

No. 1 fan of Norman Vincent Peale

Two men in leading positions
at The Pitt News are wanted for
a break-in that took place in the
writers’ conference room on the

' sixth floor of the William Pitt Un-*

ion Tuesday morning at approxi-
mately 3:37 a.m. A large, but as
of yet unknown, sum of money
was taken.

’’All the money from last
weekend's writers’ conference is
gone,” said a crushed Lee.Gut—

Publications Board and co-
ordinator of this year's confer-

ence..”|’m still in shock. The con— «

they were leaving the building
Tuesday morning.

”Dirk was carrying a bag,” said
lezzie, but at the time I didn't
think much of it because I’m used
to seeing Pitt News people leave
the building at all hours. They're
kind of a strange bunch up there.

”About 10 minutes later when
I was making my rounds, I saw

' that the door to the writers’ con-

ference room was open. The
room was a mess; they really ran-
sacked the place.”

Iezzie immediately reported
the burglary to campus police
officer Mike Pampena, who then
contacted the city police.

”We feel very strongly that
there was third party involve-
ment,” said Pampena. ”Whoever
broke in had a key, and even

 

Jim Urban

      

 

Wilfred Tremblay

Tremblay wasn't authorized to
have a key.”

lezzie said that he has strong
reason to believe the third party
was Pitt News Editor—in—ChiefJim
Urban, who is also a house
manager at the student union and
has access to all the keys.

”Jim had talked to me about
reforming the paper with next
year's editor, John Enright,” said
lezzie. ”Jim’s a smart guy. He
wanted Tremblay and Kaufman
out of his hair, so he and Enright
could have complete control. But
if I know ’Turbo,’ he probably is
getting a cut on the stolen
money.”

Urban said he has no com-
ment. ”When I'm ready to make
an official statement," I'll com-
ment. Until then, don’t bother
me,’_’ he said.

‘ News Editor Tess Candori said
that she received a call from Kauf-

     

man yesterday at 2:17 p.m. Can-
dori is being held in custody

-downtown for refusing to reveal

Kaufman's whereabouts. It is ru-
mored that Candori and Kaufman
have been ”carrying on” for
some time now’.

”Dirk has taught me so much
over the year, and there is no way
I could squeal on him,” Candori
said in a telephone interview
from Allegheny County jail. ”It’s

been-acting strange ever since his
meeting with Bob Greene last

‘weekend.
”I can understand Kaufman be—’

ing involved in this,” said Gut-

close to completing his Ph. D.,

“They were real tough,” said
Jim Sluck, PIKA brother and IFC
president. ”A lot of the brothers
went down at first. The girls had

this strategy of digging their nails ,

into our eyes. A brother wouldn't
be able to see once his eye sock-

ets filled up with blood, and that's .

when the girlwould kick the hell
out of his kidneys.”

Sluck stated that verbal support
from fellow Greek members
played an important role in the
fights. ”The crowd was really in-
tense,” he said. ”They always
yelled for more blood. It really
helped to pump you up when it
came your turn to fight.”

The contest was tied at 15

_ matches apiece when Babsy

Harvey Wallbanger, in an excit-
ing match.

”She got me off guard and

Urban starts over 

By Joe Pitt
Staff Virus

Pitt News Editor—in-Chief Jim
Urban announced yesterday that

after careful consideration, he has '

decided to start The Pitt News
over from scratch.

”After careful consideration, I -

have decided to start the paper
over from scratch,” Urban said in
a prepared statement to a packed
William Pitt Union Assembly
Room.

”I have sat in on several publi-
cations board meetings in the
past months,” Urban said, ”and
my conclusion is that The Pitt
News is really a lousy paper. Af-
ter careful consideration, I have
decided that it would be best if
we start_the paper over from
scratch.”

The publications board consists
of eight people, both students
and professionals, whojointly
serve as the publisher of The Pitt
News.

It has expressed concern over
bad writing in the newspaper,
such as repetitiveness. That is
why Urban has decided to start
the paper over from scratch.

”They made me realize just

. how unfair — as editor—in-chief —
I have been to certain groups of
people, and they also made me
realize how lousy the people
who edit our stories are,” Urban
said. ’’I think I'll start the paper
over from scratch.”

When the new Pitt News gets

things going again, Urban said he
will instill some new rules.

”For starters, I will require desk
editors to spend 23 hours per day
up here, instead of 20 hours per
day like it was before,” Urban
said.

He also plans on taking a new
editorial approach.

”Every writer will have to
spend at least one month
researching his story,” Urban
said. ”We will leave no stone un-
turned. For example, I just gave
out an assignment this morning.
I told News Editor Kathy Stahl to
dig up the arrest reports for every
Oakland—area arrest for the past

‘I0 years. I want her to find out

exactly where these people that

are getting arrested were living.” -

Urban also plans to urge mem-
bers of the publications board to
come up to The Pitt News on
deadline nights more often than
usuaL

”That’s right,” he said.» ”We
would like them to come up
twice per decade instead of once
per decade.”

And he hopes these changes
will help the paper eventually be
able to publish four days per
week.

”I realized there is no-possible
way this-paper could have possi-
bly published four days per week
next year like we originally had
hoped,” Urban said. ”We just
have too many problems. Be-
sides, that idea was financially
motivated anyway.”

THE PITT SNOOZE, Wednesday, April l, 1987

Line formers under the gun at campus buildings

By Dirk Kaufman

Matt Kennedy Fan Club President

Officials at Thackeray Hall and
the campus bookstore banded
together Monday and vowed to
gun down any students who at-
tempt to form a line at or near
either of the two buildings this
fall.

”We’re sick and tired of stu-
dents who are sick and tired of
standing in lines," an anonymous

member of the group said
Monday.

Sympathizers for the radical
counter clerks will be character-
ized by a blue and gold arm band
with the letters S.S. (Student
Shooter) emblazoned on it.

”Every year, these kids show
up here acting like we just love
to see them form lines and wait,”
one silver—haired bandito who
works at the bookstore said. ”I
hate the little jerks, and I just

stand behind the counter and
think of ways I can fool them into
‘paying double for their books.”
_ Ima Killer, self—proclaimed
leader of the organization, said
each cashier will be given a .22
caliber gun to replace their elec-
tronic check-out guns.

”The damn things never work
anyway,” she said. ”They only
add to the aggravation of the
day.”

Pitt researchers discover
that AIDS virus cures cancer

By Matthew Thornton

The Guy Who Still Thinks The World Is
Flat

In a meeting early yesterday,
Cheech Marin, head of the better-
living—through-modern-chemistry
team at Pitt, reported that the
AIDS virus has been found to
cure cancer.

The claim, released at a press
conference held in the third-floor
rest room of the Cathedral, was
the result of some intensive
research Marin conducted the
past two months. He placed sam-
ples of the AIDS virus in non-
consenting cancer patients and
studied the effects.

”I’m really excited,” Marin
said.>”I get the feeling that I'm
contributing something very im-
portant to the medical com-

I munity.”

When questioned about the
possible side effects of the treat-
ment, Marin conceded that it did
seem to kill a fairly large portion
of the test population.

”Actually,” he said, ”they all
died — not a single one of them
left. But, on the good side, they
don't have to worry about the

cancer anymore.”

The radical treatment has been
vehemently criticized by other
members of the medical com-
munity. ,

”I don't think that he's opened
any new possibilities,” a surgeon
testified. ”He’s cured the cancer,
sure, but I don't think he has any
idea how hard it is to get the vi-
rus isolated.”

The treatment, expected to be
approved early next week by the
FDA, will probably cost between
$4,000 to $5,000, Marin told
reporters. ‘

”Ideally, I'd like to get it down
to about $2,000,” he said, ”but
it looks bad. The price of every-
thing, even a good, healthy infec-
tion, has been going up lately.”

Also reported at the conference
were advances in other areas: A
research team from the Universi-
ty of Ridicule, Oral Roberts
presiding, stated that they have
found a way to turn religious‘
ideals into money. The treatment
reportedly hinges on a rare form
of mental illness, called the ”gim-
mie” complex, discovered in a
small church in medeival

.England..

ployees have been given authori-

”We don't intend to kill any-
one,” she said. ”That’s why we
bought the .225. We just want
people to have something to
remember about lines the next
time they come in the store.”

At Thackeray Hall, employees
are encouraged to invite family
and friends to perch themselves
atop Children's Hospital with
high-powered rifles, should the
registration lines extend outside
the building.

”There’s nothing worse than a
bunch of whining brats com-
plaining about a class being
closed,” one veteran of the annu-

al queue forming said. ”This way,
we have an outlet with which to
stop the complaints and dis-
courage people from coming up
here in such huge numbers.”

University President Wesley

Posvar, a veteran of the U.S. Air
Force, said he is all for the new
plan._

”Pitt is a world-class institu-
tion,” he said. ”I can see nothing
but good coming from the idea.”

Most students questioned"

about the new policy said they
would carry weapons of their
own in the coming term.

The National Rifle Association
said in a prepared statement that
what was good for Budd Dwyer
is surely good enough for Pitt.

Prank costs frat
its local charter

By Joe Zeff
A Credit To The Greek System

' Theta Nu Gamma fraternity has
been denied a charter from the
University of Pittsburgh because
of its latest pledge prank, Greek
Adviser Bridget Guernsey said
last night at an lnterfraternity
Council meeting.

The Theta Nu Gammas have
been accused of stealing Yellow
Cab No. 130 earlier this week
and hiding it in a bus stop near
the William Pitt Union. The
fraternity members were not
identified in police reports, but
someone eating spaghetti in Rax
was overheard telling the person
sitting beside him that he had
heard someone who worked at
the Original Hot Dog Shop men-
tion that P_itt senior John
DeGregorio might have had
something to do with it.

‘'1 don't think so. We were mix-

ing with Tri Delt that night,” said
DeGregorio, 21, who has been
working toward obtaining a
charter for Theta Nu Gamma
since September 1985, when he
and two other students walked
onto the Pitt Stadium AstroTurf
before a home football game car-
rying a tall wooden placard bear-
ing Greek letters. Since then,
Theta NulGamma has purchased
more than $10,000 worth of dis-
play advertisements in The Pitt
News.

’’I turned down a bid from FIJI
in order to keep Theta Nu Gam-
ma going, and this is difficult to
accept,” DeGregorio said. ’’I
would never do anything that
would in some way harm Theta
Nu Gamma. 1 hope Miss Guern-
sey will reconsider.”

Terry Lucas, professional busi-
ness manager of The Pitt News,
said Theta Nu Gamma has _been

Earlier in the year, Roberts : E.

t .

The nation waited and prayed. '

Due in part to the generous 1,  S

Roberts was able to meet this *
goal. Believing that he was :
”home free,” Roberts made a ,
public statement that although he i
reached his goal, money is still *
needed for the spreading of "

Pitt basketball coach Paul
Evans is in total shock.

Evans’ future starting swing-
man, his ”ace-in—the—ho|e” as he
once put it, is handing in his Pan-
ther uniform for good. Marlon
Ferguson, a 6-8 senior from
Center High School in Monaca,
Pa., has decided to forgo his
basketballcareer in order to pur-
sue a position on the Pitt cheer-
leading squad. And he is
absolutely delighted about the
whole idea.

”You know, I'd sit there on the
bench and just watch those
cheerleaders bouncing around
like they do,” said Ferguson.-
”Then I said to.myseIf one day

Cheerleader Bob Moore seems
to agree. ”Marlon is a wonderful

Ferguson announced his deci-

but tearful speech, an equally
sullen Evans stepped up to the
podium to comment on the sit-
uation.

”I wish Marion the best, in
whatever he does. He'll be a pret-
ty good cheerleader. And it'll be
tough for me to look across the
floor at him during games, but
well, I always knew he was a lit-
tle bit flaky.’-’

The press conference was filled
with celebrities from both the en-
tertainment and the sporting
worlds, all expecting Ferguson to
announce his opting for hardship
and the NBA. What transpired
came as a harsh jolt to many.

Pitt basketball star Charles
Smith has decided to leave
school, but not for the NBA, as
many had expected.

Last night in a phone interview
from his Trimont apartment pent-
house in Mount Washington,
Smith said that he has signed with
a pro football agent and will be
entering April's NFL draft.

While everyone was shocked
by the announcement, Smith
thinks pro football is his calling.

’’I’m just trying to follow in the
footsteps of Sam Clancy, Daryl
Shephard, Keith‘ Armstrong and
Darrell Gissendanner,” said the
6-10 Smith.

All of the aforementioned play-
ers played basketball at Pitt but
received tryouts with NFL teams.

Clancy, a defensive end for the

Cleveland Browns, is the only

one of the four who plays in the A

league. -
Smith said Pitt's reputation as
a football — not a basketball —

power is what swayed his deci-
sion. ”Pitt doesn't have any pro
basketball players, so the odds
were stacked against me,” said
Smith. ”Dan Marino, Tony Dor-
sett, Hugh Green -— I mean Pitt
has so many players in the NFL.”

NFL scouts project Smith to be
a late first-, early second-round
pick as a defensive back.

Gil Brandt, general manager of
the Dallas Cowboys, had this to
say about the man who could be-
come the tallest player in the his-
tory of the NFL. ”-When I found
out Charles ran a 4.5 [40—yard
dash], that's all I needed to hear.
I would love to have him,” said
Brandt. ”With his size and speed
he could be devastating.”

Smith has his critics though. Pitt
football coach Mike Gottfried
doesn't think Smith, a first—team
All—Big East performer this past
season, can make it. ”He fouled

Marlon Ferguson A.

out of nine games playing basket-
ball this year. How in the heck is
he gonna cover a speedy wide
receiver,” said Gottfried. ’’He’ll
get called for pass interference all
the time.” ’

‘ But many will wonder for years
to come why Smith didn't go to
the NBA, where he was project-
ed to be a Top 10 pick.

Smith's teammate Demetreus
Gore had the answer. ”Charles is

. so physical playing hoops, but he

would be perfect playing foot-
ball,” said Gore. ”He was getting
sick of getting beat on in games.
The refs never showed him any
respect. In the NFL, he'll get
that.”

Pitt basketball coach ‘Paul
Evans said Smith's decision was
”the worst judgment I've ever,
seen a college kid make. I
thought Charles had a head on
his shoulders; obviously he
doesn’t.” .

Evans said he will not go out to
recruit a big man to replace Smith
but would go with the players al-
ready committed to the program.

Smith's departure paves the
way for freshman forward/center
Steve Maslek to step right in.
Maslek, whose 14 career points

rank 997th on Pitt’s"all-time scor-j 

ing list, hopes to step right in and
start immediately.

Big East coaches generally
"agree that Maslek has superstar
qualities. ”Watching Maslek sit
on the bench this past season,
you could just see he had that All-
America look to him. Big, mean,
physical —— he'll be a brute next
season,” said St. John's Lou Car-
nesecca. _ _

Georgetown’s John Thompson,"
who coaches one of the most ath-
letic group of players in the coun-
try, said he always loved Mas|ek’s
natural ability. ”Steve just gets up
anddown out of his seat‘ so well
for a big guy,” said Thompson.
”Plus, he can play. I've seen films-

Take women's athletics seri-
ously? Who, me?

There are some things that the
world just has to come to terms
with. One of these things is that
the media condescends the exis-
tence of a woman athlete.

Who cares if Pitt has the No. 1
women's team in the Big East in
anything? No one pays attention
to the women's teams. Even if the
male teams are plodding through
a .500 season, people will remain

‘loyal to those programs‘.

Take the men's basketball
team. Hardly a mediocre bunch,
but still a big draw this season.
These guys gave new definition
to the word frenzy. The media
had a field day watching the suc-

cess of our own Cinderella.

The women's volleyball team
won the Big East tournament 

i in November. Remember? Need

I remind everyone that Penn State
clobbered Pitt 34-14 in football?
That's going to be touted for three
weeks prior to the 1987 rematch,
and don't tell me it won't be.
It's a man's world.

Now before everyone pulls out
paper and pens and storms over
to the student union, let me say
one thing.

I am not defending this posi-
tion, I am saying what I think is
apparent.

So you don't agree with me. So
what? We're all entitled to our
own opinion. So don't flip to
another article because you dis-
agree with what I’m saying. Con-
tinue to read, and at least see my
point.

Take a long hard look at your
own interests. If you like sports,
what sport do you follow? Do
you turn to the women's volley-
ball, basketball or swimming ar-
ticles in The Pitt News before you
look at anything else? '

I don't think so.

You might not like everything
you read in the paper, but a
reporter's job isn't designed to
make her look good or win her
any popularity contests. She
writes about what she sees.‘

Report the facts, right? What if
the facts make someone look

KELLEY BIl'I"I'

bad? Then what? It's my job to al-
low that person to dig his own
grave (i.e. — I don't tell people
what to say).

I can't help it if the people I in-
terview feel compelled to tell me
all of the dirt he or she knows.

People who like to talk make
my job easier and articles more
interesting, and frankly, dirt sells
copies.

That's one good thing about
being a reporter.  You would be
amazed at the things I know. You
would be even more surprised at
the information that some of the
editors up here withhold from
you people.

As a matter of fact, I'm tired of
trying to interest you in the plight
of women's athletics. I can tell
you don't care, which is a damn
shame, but I can't change it. I'm
not going to try anymore.

Have you heard the latest?

I thought that would get your

attention 

0 Shelton Collier, University of
Pittsburgh women's volleyball
coach, has turned down the po-
sition of head coach for the 42nd
time since January.

Collier, head coach here at Pitt
since 1980, announced in Janu-
ary that he was leaving for a job
on the West Coast. He was forced
to hand in his resignation be-
cause it is against NCAA regula-
tions to coach at the college and
professional levels at the same
time.

Rumor had it (as recently as
yesterday) Collier was going to
return to the Lady Panther volley-
ball program as head coach in the
fall.

Somebody lied.

After talking with various
sources, it appears that Collier
will not be returning after all.

According to Senior Pentagon
sources, ”We have other plans
for Collier —— plans that will take
up the next several years of his
life.” ,

Women's sports teams virtually ignored J

the least of the women's volley-
ball program's worries. The team
may be disbanded because of
their recent success.

”We were told to start losing.
When we brought home the Big
East title, we were under the im-
pression that no one cared if we
won it or not.

”Of course that was the
weekend of the big Pitt-Penn
State FOOTBALL game. I think
that sucks,” said a member of the
volleyball team who wished to
remain anonymous.

Another playeralso wishing to
preserve anonymity stated, ”Joe
Paterno personally called to tell
us to ‘quit making the [Pitt] foot-
ball team look bad. For Pete's
sake, have some mercy.’ ”

that it was his fault that she had

If Smith wouldhave stayed at
Pitt, the Panthers probably would
have been a preseason Top Five
team next, season, but without
him, they still may be ranked
high. ”Smith was good, but Steve
is so much’more physical. Plus,
not to knock Smith, he disap-
pearedjn a lot of games this year.
Even in some games Pitt won,
Smith did a disappearing act,”
said one Big East coach who
asked to remain nameless. '.

Urban had this to say about
Smith: ’’I thought [Keith] Arm-

_strong’s eligibility was up last

year, but watching Pitt play this
season, it looked like he was still
out there.”

Degenerate

After hundreds of rumors and
innumerable senseless assump-
tions, the truth has finally sur-
faced surrounding the Valerie
Halesworth controversy.

Halesworth, who was asked to
leave the Lady Panther basketball
team late this past season, an-
nounced with Pitt’s second—year
head football coach Mike Gott-
fried that she was the unanimous
choice among the Pitt football
staff to replace graduating John
Congemi as the starting quarter-
back for next season.

Lady Panther basketball coach
Kirk Bruce admits that, while he
played along with the idea as he

was asked to, he didn't like it that-

much. ”I guess the move was the
best one for Pitt athletics on the
whole,” said Bruce. ”I really
thought we could win the Big
East tournament, but without Val
our chances were shot.”
Gottfried claims that he disco-
vered Halesworth four years ago
when he was recruiting for Kan-
sas, where he was head coach
from 1983 to 1985. Unknown to
Pitt students and staff, Gottfried is
heavily into transcendental medi-
tation. ”Most people don't be-
lieve me, but I knew that I was
coming to Pitt about six years

.  .

sion. I knew I’d need a

ago,” he claimed. ”It came to me
in a vision. I knew'I’d need a
quarterback about now.

”I went to Oyster Bay, N.Y.,
and I came out with a pearl!” ad-
ded Gottfried.

Halesworth is ”ecstatic” about
her future with Pitt football. ”I

A had a real hard time keeping a lid

on the plans they had for me,”
she said. ”Now I can tell
everybody.”

She continued, ”Basketball just
wasn't my pace. I knew that
sooner or later I'd get my shot at
a real sport. I liken myselfto Sam
Clancy or, now, Charlie Smith..”

Unfortunately, thousands of
Lady Panther basketball season
ticket holders were left without
explanation. ’’I bought my tickets
strictly because of Val,’’ said Sean

‘O'Connell, an avid Lady Panther

      I   .'  

Haleswo rth I to play  for foo-tbal I t

follower who has had season
tickets for two years now.
”There’s no way I'm going to
sleep out overnight again this
year.” ‘

Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik
fears great losses in next year's
women's basketball season tick-
et sales.

”She was our big draw,” Bozik
claimed. ”Football sells out every
year regardless. I'm not sure if I
approve of the switchover.”

Accordingto_Butch Urani, Pitt's
athletic legal counsel, the move
is in accordance with all NCAA
regulations.

However, James Nix, president
of the NCAA Players-Equality
Board said that Pitt is operating
under the Rosie Ruiz code of
ethics. ”They’re just trying to grab
headlines by being the first major
college to field a starting female
quarterback, I definitely plan on
filing suit.”

Probably most upset over the
move are junior college transfer
Sal Genilla and sixth—year senior
Joe Felitsky.

”I know she's agreat athlete,
but she's only 5-5,” said Felitsky.
”I thought I proved myself last
year. Besides, where is she gon-
na dress, and does she have to
wear a jock like all the rest of us?
It's just not fair.”

Pitt News’ Enright trying out for Panthers

Burt Grossman

tor figures it, a big guy who's long
been known for his mean attitude
on the basketball court has a di-
vine right to prove his prowess on
the gridiron too.

Enright will be strapping on his
pads for fall football practice at
Johnstown and attempts to be-
come the first sports editor/walk-
on ever to start at defensive end
for the Pitt Panthers.

"I've just been watching these
guys play for the last three years,
and I know in my mind I can do
a better job," Enright said at a me-
dia luncheon yesterday.

Reporters from the tri-state area
were mildly surprised when Ep-

mation Director Jim O'Brien

"One time he swiped the

Enright said he thinks he has a
good shot at running Panther

ground in the battle for a starting
spot

"I don't know, I just think he
thinks he's a lot tougher than he
really is,” Enright said. ’’I saw
him earlier this year at the ’O,’
and I just wasn't that impressed.

’’I mean, he's a nice guy and
everything, but I don't think he'll
be able to handle me at crunch
time."

Mike Gottfried said it could
turn out to be a tough choice be-
tween the- two.

Lane to sign with

roller derby team

By Jim Rural'and-
John Enwrong
Staff Writers

The Pitt News learned late last
night that Pitt basketball star Jer-
ome Lanefwould forego his last
two years of college eligiblity and
sign with the San Francisco Bay
Bombers of the North American
Roller Derby League.

I "It’s my kinda game,” Lane
in a phone interview.
”Basketball was getting a little
ridiculous  they were putting
five and six guys on me at one

v time."

Lane said his first priority
would be to get a good pair of
roller‘ skates.

"I saw this pair down at Honus
Wagner that I really liked," he
said. ”They are purple."

"I'm surprised," Pitt coach Paul
Evans said. ''Call me back in the
morning and we'll talk about it
then. I'm too_ tired now.”

Lane said he would like to
knock out self-appointed roller
derby queen Georgia Haas.

"She's big and ugly," Lane
said. "She kinda reminds me of
Ben Gillery from Georgetown."

Evans said he has two options
left now that he has lost most of
his front line — Smith, Lane and
Ferguson.

"We will either recruit like cra-
zy," Evans said, "or we'll cut an

album with Demetreus as our

lead singer."

Co—captains, Pitt Swim Team, 1977

Five Pitt swimmers met their
deaths when they were eaten

alive by two sharks during prac—,

tice at Trees Pool Tuesday af-
ternoon.

The swimmers who fell prey to
the shark attack were senior cap-
tain Tom Shaulinski, junior Jim
Emore, freshman diverjohn Shar-
key, freshman Sandy Albright and
senior Jodi O'Neil‘.

The shark attack is the first to
occur at the Trees Hall facility

since before the Pitt/Penn State .

meet» last year when two Pitt stu-
dents and one coach perished.

The tragedy has been described.
by the pool maintenence crew as
the worst aquatic tragedy of this
century.

The maintenence crew was
spraying for waterbugs when they
heard ”b|ood curdling” screams
coming from the swimming area.

”We were just looking for
those there waterbugs when all of
the sudden we be hearing a big
noise coming from the water. I be

darned if it didn't look like Jaws‘

right in the mouth,” said Chief

Maintenence Engineer Hugh G.
Rection.

The Pitt men's an women's
swimming and diving teams were
conducting afternoon practice as
usual when the shark attack
occured.

At 3:30 p.m. the first incident
was cited. According to Rection,
senior team captain Tom Shaulin-
ski was surfing when his surf-
board suddenly split in two.

Shaulinski disappeared under
the water, soon after his blood
stained swimsuit floated to the
top.

”Everyone was puzzled. No
one knew what had happened,”
said Rection. All of the sudden
we heard a big burp. Now l.B.

ajammin (Pitt's new 800 pound

swimming recruit) had just
downed a large pizza and ’O’
fries in the locker room, and we
naturally assumed that the gastric
disturbance was his. We had no
idea it was a shark.”

Pitt juniorjim Emore then dove
into the pool to search for the
senior team captain. According to
an eyewitness Emore swam
around for a while before he too

‘ THE PITT SNOOZE, Wednesday, April 1, 1987

A not so serious insidepeak .
at major league baseball in '87‘

If it's snowing then this must be
April in Pennsylvania. Not quite
the same as April in Paris, but
close.

Two things happen in, April.
One of which, at least according
to the old saying, is that every
time any of us takes a shower this
month, we are somehow induc-
ing flowers to bloom in May. The
only other claim to fame'ApriI has
is the start of the baseball season.

So here it is: the official 1987
Major League Baseball Book of
Predictions.

>1‘ * *

National League East

Philadelphia Phillies — The
Phils will win the NL East this
year for three reasons. And once
I know what those reasons are, I
will share them with you.

New York Mets,— The World
Series winners will fall to second
place in 1987. Ron Darling's wife
will divorce him, causing much
strain for the entire Met staff. The
former Mrs. D. will hook up with
a young college sportswriter from
the University of Pittsburgh.
Dwight Gooden will be clocked

this season at 97 mph. In his car-

His fastball will mellow consider-
ably, and he'll take to listening to
old Dan Fogelberg albums.

St. Louis Cardinals — The
Cardinals are a funny team. Why,
just the othergday I heard Ozzie
Smith do the best Ozzie Nelson
impression. I, like Allen Ginsberg
before me, howled at the exhibi-
tion. I have no reason to think
they will finish third, other than
the fact that I am wearing a Cardi-
nal cap as I write this, and "I
would hate to think that I'm wear-
ing the cap of a lousy team.

Chicago Cubs — The Cubs
play all their home games in day-
light. Wise old owls play all their
home games at night. The Cubs
should be so smart. “

Pittsburgh Pirates — The
Pirates are dropping the old-
fashioned "box-cap" hat they've
worn for 10 years in favor of the
black hats with the gold "P" they
wore in the '50s and '60s.

The Tradition is back. In the
'50s and '60s the Buccos finished
at or near the bottom of the stand-
ings nearly every year. The Tra-
dition is back.

Montreal Expos — Olympic
Stadium in Montreal is supposed
to be domed this spring. The offi-

. cial reason is so that the Expos

won't‘have as many rain-outs this

mnvens

year. The actual reason is so that
when God looks down at Mon-
treal, he won’t have to watch this
sorry team play baseball. Hey,

, Tim, Raines, HA HA HA!-
>l< >l< *

National League West

Cincinnatti Reds — The Reds
have some good players. I can't
remember any of their names
right now but, believe me, they
can hit. And throw. And run. And
boy, can they slide. And eat. And
sleep. And chew. And sing. And
you should just see them ski ..

Los Angeles Dodgers — In the
words of baseball writer Randy
Newman, ”Hate New York City
—— its teams play so cheap. And
the people throw things at your
head. Don't like Chicago. The
Cubs and Sox are just a little too
dull for you and me  Butl LOVE
LA!

San Fransisco Giants — Based
on the fervent belief that this team
does not exist — they should be
the New York Giants — I will not
give a prediction for them’.

Houston Astros — Wanna
know why the Astros never win
the big one? It's because‘ they

play in softball uniforms. Profes-.

sional baseball players looking
like they just stepped out of
Riley's Bar and Grill. It's mighty
embarrassing.

Atlanta Braves — Mets pitcher
Ron Darling was on the cover of
GO magazine a few months ago.
Braves third baseman Bob Horn-
er was on the cover of Tons of
Fun_ Digest. The Braves are no
good. Never have been. Never
will be. This is because the
Braves are an eastern team play-
ing in the western division. It
goes against the laws of nature.

San Diego‘ Padres — Who real- I

ly cares? ' »
* =l< >l<
American League East

Toronto Blue Jays — They.
have the best outfield in baseball.
And the players the Jays have to

‘ play on that outfield aren't bad

either. A

Boston Red Sox — I will not
have respect for this team until
they learn the proper spelling of
the word SOCKS. Nice play, Bill.

Cleveland Indians — Oh, don't
worry, guys. You could finish
third, first, win a World Series.
Go I62-0. I don't care. YOUR
CITY STILL STINKS.

Detroit Tigers — Kirk Gibson
just broke a world aviation record
byflying his Piper airplane at
28,000 feet. Gee, that's almost as
high as Dave Parker used to get.
Kirk's dad, Mel Gibson, will be
at the Tigers home opener.

Baltimore Orioles — The Ori-
oles will be in good shape ifthey
get rid of that fat guy at third base.

New York Yankees — The
Yanks take a nose dive without
Brian Fisher. Don Mattingly is
discovered to be not of the homo
sapien persuasion and is asked to
leave the game of baseball.

Milwaukee, Brewers — At least
Brew Crew fans can drink away
their sorrows in Schlitz beer.

* * *
American League West
Kansas City Royals — It's been

' two years, and George Brett still

can't sit on the bench. And by the
way, Bret S., you keep pitching
like you did last year, and that
cute little baby of yours is gonna
be going to bed mighty hungry.
‘Washed-up pitchers are a dime-
a—dozen.

California Angels —— To the
tune of "California Dreamin’ ”:
Reg-gie Jackson's gone, and the
Angels choked. Gene Mauch’s
getting old, and he thought he'd
croak. Wally Joyner's younger,
but he's just as bad. One pitch
from the series. I think that's pret-
ty sad  California Angels, on
such a summer's day. Well you
get the idea.

Texas Rangers — Nobody
cares. The most nowhere team in
major league baseball.

Minnesota Twins — I would
pick the Twins higher, but they
changed their logo from the "TC”
design to this really silly looking
letter M. I don't like the new look.
Neither should you.

Chicago White Sox —— See
Boston Red Sox.

Seattle ‘Mariners The
Mariners almost signed free agent
Tim Raines last month. Raines
with manager Dick Williams?
Thank heavens we were spared
the misery of their fights all
season.

Oakland As — Reggie's back in
town. So is hoppin’ Jose Canse-
co. The As will probably win the
series.

Continued from page 17

was pulled under the water. A
muffled gargling sound was
heard before his blood saturated
Speedo swimsuit floated to the
surface, and again another burp
rang through the facility.

_ The other swimmers chose to
ignore the situation figuring they
would leave the two alone since
they had chosen to abandon their
swimsuits.

After approximately 15 minutes
and 15 seconds had elapsed, and
the two hadn't surfaced, men's
head swimming coach Fred
Lewis sent freshman diver John
Sharkey into the pool to see what
had happened.

Sharkey did a‘ backward two
and ‘/2 summersault dive into the
water. He hit the surface with 9.9

accuracy. This:was the best dive _

Sharkey had executed all season.
Unfortunately his best dive
turned out to be-his last, when his
shredded swimsuit also floated to
the top of the water. .

Women's swimming coach
David Belowich decided to take
matters into his own hands send-
ing two of his strongest swimmers
into the water.

Senior Jodi O'Neil and Sandy

‘Albright surfaced screaming, as

toes, fingers and other body parts
were floating up around them.

"Albright and O'Neil were
screaming, ‘shark! shark!,' " said
Belowich. "Nobody moved to
help them. We just figured they
.were screaming about John
Sharkey.’’ .

The two killer sharks then sur-
faced devouring Albright and

._O’Neil_ and then burping. By this

time swimming practice was can-
celled, and the swimming area
was evacuated.

The incident is being investigat-

ed by the Pittsburgh Police and '

the Universal Oceanography As-
sociation. At press time the Penn
State University swim team is
considered the prime suspectin
the case.

The day of the incident a Pitt
student, who wishes to remain
anonymous,- observed various
Penn State swimmers as well as
a man who looked likeloe Pater-
no entering the Trees Hall swim-
ming facility with a large fish tank
labeled ‘SHARK.’

SWIMMING NOTES: The
Trees Hall pool will be closed the
remainder of this vveekdue to the
filming of laws IV. '

The Fifth Beatle

The Pitt baseball team is off to
its best start in history. Not only
are the Panthers unbeaten in
seven games this season, they
have yet to give up a hit.

The Panther pitching staff has
been stellar in shutting down all
189 batters it has faced. The
closest anybody came to getting
a hit was when Seton Hall's Jerry
”The Killer” Gambino smashed
a Pitt catcher over the head with
his bat.

”We’re doing OK,” a Pitt pitch-
er said. ”And we're gettin’ good

- grades. The future's so bright we

gotta wear shades.”

been getting in on the act, wear-

ples. But those stats pale in com-
parison to the numbers Brian

THE PITT SNOOZE, Wednesday, April l, 1987

Arena football may be inMcRae’s plans

By Sam Tallarico
7964 U.S. Men's Olympic Track Coach

With the outdoor track season
underway, the men's team is
looking forward to what just may
be their most successful season in
recent memory.

That is, of course, if the rumors
aren't true.

From anonymous tips to casual
word of mouth, a rumor circulat-
ing in the press room is that Pitt
junior Lee McRae, world record
holder in the 55—meter dash, will
bypass the 1988 Olympic Games
in Seoul, South Korea, and turn
his sights to arena football. .

I'm not kidding. Really. Arena
football is coming to Pittsburgh,
and if we're lucky, maybe Lee
can stay here in Pittsburgh.

You can't really blame him.
Hershel Walker, Willie Gault,

Pitt

busted my brother Juan-Carlos-

Migue|—Enrique and my sister‘

Juanita-Angelina as they tried to
sneak across the border at Lare-

do two years ago. They broke ’

their friggin’ skulls, man.”

Lewis credits much of the Pan-
ther success this season to the
club's move to Yankee Stadium.
”The lighting is better in the stadi-
um,” Lewis said. ”Not only that,
but the South Bronx [home of
Yankee Stadium] is in a much
better neighborhood than Trees
Field.”

Pitt's tightest game of the year
was a 10-0 victory over Seton
Hall at the stadium. The differ-
ence in the game was the pitch-
ing of Panther ace Tony Woods,
who threw several types of screw-
balls in an obvious effort to im-
press the numerous agents in
attendance at the game.

A minor controversy erupted
after the contest when Woods
signed what he thought was an
autograph. But suddenly a sleazy-
looking guy burst out of the

crowd and claimed he was __an_.— ”l'_1_op_e_.he don't just sit around_

Ron Brown and Renaldo Ne- _

hemiah, all former track greats,
have all turned in track spikes for
shoulder pads.

Who can resist the money, the
glitter, the pain.

McRae himself won't dismiss
the rumors. ’’I’m not saying that
I'm going to play, but I'm going
to think about it and weigh out
all the options,” said McRae,
breaking his week-long silence
toward the media.

McRae’s teammates seem to
respect his American freedom of
choice and will stand behind
whatever decision he wishes to
make.

”You know, it's Lee's life, and
he can do with it whatever he
chooses. He's a smart kid, and
I'm sure he'll make the right de-
cision,” said senior Tim Manes.

agent and Woods signed a con-
tract with him.

By that time, however, Woods
had already signed several more
autographs and chaos reigned.
Mike Gottfried launched an in-
vestigation into the matter and
found the SMU board of regents
to be responsible.

Following that incident, Woods
quit the team to enroll in a con-
tracts class at the Pitt law school.

Never one to be bothered by
distractions, Lewis said the team
would not miss a step due to the
abscence of its ace pitcher. The
new phenomon on the mound is

none other than former singer- _

songwriter Bruce Springsteen, a
6-0, 185 pitcher out of Freehold,
N.J.

”He could throw that speedball
by you, just like you was stand-
ing still,” is how scout Branch
Rickey summed up the Boss’
arm. One problem Rickey sees
with Springsteen may be com-
placency. ”Bruce had a good
year at Asbury Park last season.
He was 17-4 with _a 1.08 ERA. l

”Lee’s a smart kid. He has so
much talent and so much
strength, he can do whatever he
puts his mind to,” said sopho-
more runner Dave Moore. ’’I’m
sure he'll make the right de-
cision.”

Pitt men's track coach John
Vasvary echoes his runners"opin—
ions on McRae’s plight. ”Lee
McRae has been an enormous as-
set to our program. He's helped
to turn Pitt track into a household
name. If he wants to continue to
help our program thrive and
dominate the track world, that's
fine. -

”However, if he wishes to car-
ry on his life's ambition of being
a professional arena football play-
er, more power to him. I'm sure
he'll make the right decision.”

With_ all this in mind, we took
to the Oakland streets to get some

thinking about it, but he proba-
bly will.” _

Panther Notes:Pitt was StreeT
and Smith's choice to win the Na-
tional League East this year, and
it looks as though the Panthers
will disappoint no one.... Bobf
by Lewis now has 234,975 wins
in his Pitt career, which dates
back to the mid—llth century.
Let's hope he's around" for

student reactions to this football
fiasco.

’’I think it's an electrifying
sport, and with an athlete as
talented as the great Lee McRae,
the sport of arena football will
catch on fast,” said Kelley Butt,
avid arena football fan and pos-
sible cheerleader for the team.

’_’I don't know about this sport.
It sounds so second-rate, and
that's not Lee's style,” said Matt
O'Hara, local sports god. ”He
should stay on the track team, go
to the Olympics, make millions
in endorsements, and most im-
portant — get that degree.”

Many others agreed that

O’Hara’s view was the more |og— ..

ic_al of all options, but then again,
maybe Michelle Quinn, local
sports groupie, said it best.

”What the hell is arena
football?”

it may be tough for McRae to
choose which road to take, but
we wouldn't want to influence
his decision. Salaries in this

league run no higher than‘

$50,000, and the inaugural sea-
son runs from mid—June to the be-
ginning of August.

The one thing this sport has go-
ing for it is that it's only a month
and a half long. Thank goodness
for small miracles.

We must realize that this deci-
sion is McRae’s and his alone.

’’Like I said, I want to check out
the pros and cons of this arena
football. I'm not going to give up
everything I've worked so hard
for just for 50 grand,” said the
amateur-conscious McRae.

As said before, McRae must.
choose, but everyone is sure he'il ‘

make the right decision.
