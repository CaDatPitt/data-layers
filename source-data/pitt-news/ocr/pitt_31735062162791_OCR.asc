Poet toHold
Discussion

Coffee Hour

Alastair Reid, Scottish born
poet, ‘ will meet students ‘informal-
ly at a coffee hour this afternoon
at.3 p.m. in’ the Student Union
lounge. '

Reid, who is presently complet-
ing a novel, spoke at noon today
at the Midday Series program on
the topic “Poetic Eccentricity.”

He came. to this country after
World War II and taught at Sarah
Lawrence College. Several period-
icals, the “Atlantic Monthly” and
the “New Yorker” in particular,
began to publish his poetry reg-
ularly. In~l953 his first collection
‘of poems, “To Lighten My House’
was published. .

Having returned [to Europe

after the publication of this _vol-'

ume, Reid now lives in Spain
where he devoted his time ex-
clusively to writing.

Reid has written many chil-
‘dren?s books, including “Ounce,
Dounce, Trice,” -a work book il-

- lustrated by Ben Shahn. He has

translated from the Latin, Span-
ish, and French and provided the
librettos for six operas.

Turners‘ Meeting Slated, Today;

Isler Chairman of BIG Party,

“A Turner for President Movement,” springing ‘from

popular student opinion, will be launched at an
from 3-5 p.m. today in 306..SU.

All students interested in providing the moral suasion
for drafting and backing Woody Turner‘ for president of
Student Government Assn. should attend.

Greek Celebration
To Include Some

All-School Events

' Greek Week, an annual affair,
will once again be devoted main-
ly to the Greeks.

It was expressed by President
Kent Jarrell at ‘last week’s SGA
meeting that since Greek Week
will be the only major event this
trimester, “I heartily encourage

the Greeks to involve as many of’

the university family as. possible.”

According to Ca_rol Nathand and
John ‘Bender, co-chairmen of
Greek Week, the committee has
included. as many all-university
events as it felt would be of in-
terest to the students.

“Of course the available facil-
ities put a limit onthe number
of vents that can be included,”
commented Nathan. The ex-
pense of the entire week’s pro-
grams, held from Feb. 22 to 27,
will be assumed by the Greeks.

Among the events open to the
university family are:_ a chapel
service; an evening of basketball
at the Skibo Gym at Tech;

A Midday Series Program Fun-

(Contin“ued_onPage 2 2) -

¢ ‘Students involved in this move-

ment have- stressed that this is not
a party movement, but rather, a
student group that hopes to back
a qualiﬁed and capable man.
Eleswhere on the political front,
Chuck Isler, only announced can-
didate for student body president,
is serving as chairman of the new-
ly-organized Better Internal Gov-
ernment (BIG) Party. ‘

The official slating of his
party meeting is scheduled for
4 p.m. this Friday in Dining
Room A, SU. , ,

Isler urged that all students in-
terested in running for one of the
Student _Senate or Men’s Council
positions attend this meeting.

Purpose Cited

- Isler stated that the purpose of
the meeting would be to slate the
best possible people for all -the
positions. He repeated his position
that, “This is not a fraternity
party——all qualiﬁed people will be
considered regardless of affiliations
they may have with Greek organ-
izations.” ‘

Isler also warned that at the
moment there appears to be a
paucity of candidatesfor a. few
positions, notably from the
Schools of Education, Nursing,
and the 'aduate and Profes-
sional _Schools.

To Meet Students’ Needs

. ' A large—scale student aid program designed to meet “the ..
total demonstrated need” of any University student in good ’
standing will be available in the spring trimester, Chan-
cellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld has announced. A

The program combines g-rants—in-aid.’and- loans. It will
be available in the third trimester of every succeeding '
for as long as a need exists, the¢

year

Chancellor said ,
University officials estimate that
in the third term of this year as
m.ch as $200,000 may be involved
in the program, which is in addi-
tion to the regular student aid
budget of $1,250,000 for the aca-
demic year 1959-60,. ~ ‘
Unlike scholarships, which are

erage or better, a grant-in-aid
may be extended to a student
withless than a B averagebut
who is in_good academic standing.
Program Fulﬁlls Pledge

Chancellor Litchﬁeld said the
program is directly related to the
University’s belief in the value to
students of attendance in. three
terms per year. The increase in aid
funds, he stated, fulﬁlls the Uni-
versity’s pledge to help every stu-
dent who requires assistance in
order to take advantage of'the op-
portunity to enroll- in three con-
secutive terms;

Courts. Require

Q . ‘ 0 o I A
Streamlining’
By HARRIER WEI-INER

At the Student Government As-

sociation meeting, Monday, Bob‘

Fulton, judicial ‘chairman, said,
“The proposed by-laws to the
constitution anticipate limiting
and streamlining the jurisdiction
of certain courts.”

- As an example, Fulton said,
“Under these by-laws, men's
court’s jurisdiction would be cut,
because under the new constitu-
tion such things as cheating,

thefts, and grade-or conduct pro-I
blems are not under the jurisdic-

tion of the Student Government.

“Men’s court has no power of’

enforcement, which they seem to
have taken into their own hands

concerning the investigation‘ of the _ I

missing elevator buttons. ;_
“Also the main duty of the Su-

preme Court will be one of co.-'

ordination. At the present the in-

' ferior court situation_is far»from_

perfect. _. ,
“As an example, eaah floor of
the men's dormitory has its own
council, which could in the fu-
ture be streamlined into a sin-
gle cou'rt.”, ‘ ‘

Dr. William Swartzbaugh, dean
of students, questioned whether
the courts at the present time are
asclearly defined as they are in

the proposed by-laws to the con- I '

stitution. The question brought
about thepreceding discussion.
’ Suggests Adoption -

Bob Fulton, proposed that SGA
adopt the proposal of the judicial

committee as reported. If the pro- '0 '

posal is -accepted, it will be pub-
lished for the beneﬁt of the stu-
dent body. . - I »
At the Jan. 11 meeting’ of
.SGA, Kent Jarrell, SGA presi-
dent, stressed that he would not
take part in any activities in
politics this trimester, with the

exceptionof his duties as presi- .

dent of SGA. -

However, a letter of consider-
able length, written by J arrell and
Ray Rowney, pressuring Woody
Turner into running against
Chuck Isler for the office of presi-

dent of SGA appeared in the Jan.

25 issue of. the Pitt News.. V
“In order to justify this contra-

diction, J arrell said, “Among one’$"

many responsibilities, he has one
to his Alma Mater; my responsi-
bility to my Alma Mater consists
solely of concern for the wel-
fare of my fellow students.

these responsibilities and for no

OCEE Holds  
. Joint Meeting _
C With Spanish

Last Tuesday evening the Office

~ of Cultural and Educational Ex-

change arranged for Spanish stu-

L dents and faculty of the univers-

ity and Chatham to meet with
Costa Rican teachers who are in
this country for sixty days, under
the auspices of the U.S. Depart-
ment of S_tate.

Slides on Costa Rica, music and
conversation in Spanish were the
fare for the evening. Spanish
teachers from the Pittsburgh Pub-
lic Schools also joined with the
group. ,

The Costa Ricans came to the
university to participate in a
thre day seminar on American
attitudes and values which was
held by the O.C.E.E. During the
seminar the visitors met with
faculty‘ members and leaders from’
the city of Pittsburgh.

Since the State Department is
bringing increased numbers of-
visitors from Latin America to
this country, the O.C.E.E. is
presenting seminars and arrang-
ing conferences for more vis-
itors at the university and in the
community.

University students, therefore,

:'will have increased opportunities

to use their Spanish. The kind of
evening planned on Tuesday was
the painless way to learn the

‘ language.

lsler, W/illiams Urged
To Run Without Party

-1

Editor, the Pitt News:
The chill winds whipping
‘round the Cathedral bring with

.them again this year .the stink

of Pitt politics. The parties are
meeting in frat houses and the
student government office. Pro-
mises are thrown back and
forth. “Line up your frat behind
me and I’ll see you get president
pro tempore.”

The noble bi-weekly journal
givespus the potential candidates’
views,’ the timely announcements‘
of candidacy and a blistering
editorial on the “best” people.

.Office Service delays the all—im—

portant petitions for the even
more i m p o r t a n t Washington
order.

Bear. with it. It will all be
over on Feb. 11. Then everyone

- will settle down to the same old

rigamarole. p
But we won’t have to this
year because we have a new

-constitution‘. Fully understood of

course by its 1,049 supporters,
this document will revolutionize
student government. Much credit
must be given to Mr. Turner and

his able committee- who gave.

hours of their time to create this
masterpiece, but to no avail.

Student government will never
get off its feet. Why? Because
of the chill winds whipping
’round the Cathedral with their
stink of politics. ‘

It takes two men to run a_ race
and at this time there is only
one manrunning for president
of student government. And no
human being ,is as foolish as to
think he can beat the machine
politics of Mr. ,Isler. Honest
Chuck and ‘Phil, his running
mate, »made a dramatic state-
ment_stating their intention to
form a political party.‘ .

From the Jan. 20 edition of
the Pitt News comes this state-
ment: “They (Mr. Isler and Mr.
Williams) said that this party
will not-be a fraternity party.”

Well, last Thursday in the
smoke—ﬁlled rooms of the Pi
Lambda Phi ‘ Fraternity house,
“the Students, to Organize Poli-
tics” with a few old-guard
“Allied Collegiates,” both of

these fraternity parties, met 'with-

Mr. Isler at the helm and form-
ed a “new” party, the Better In-

ternal Government Party.

"This of course is not a frater-

nity party. No, Mr. Isler, when

you mix apples with apples you
get lemons. .
Poor Mr. Dodell stated in ‘the

Jan. 18 Pitt News, “There will

definitely be two parties. Our
party, ‘Students to. Organize Po-
litics,’ will attempt to sift __out

the best people whether or not ,

they are fraternity or sorority
people.” ' V

I Well, Mr. Dodell has been
double-crossed. The STOP is no

' more. (And it had such a catchy
- name.) There’s not going to be

two parties or two men. running
for one position. Mr. Isler and
Mr. Williams are digging their
own grave. Why even have elec-
tions? 4 '

An answer? There is one. Mr.
Isler and Mr. -Williams should

immediately‘ drop all connec-

tions with the BIG Party and
run without‘ any party support.
Let the’-BIG’s and “BEG’S” (if
you") have internal government
you have to_ have external gov-
ernment, too) ﬁght theirppretty
battles in smoke—ﬁlled rooms.

‘Humorous’. Ideas 

Culture Center Blasted .

Editor, the Pitt News: _

The columns appearing in the
Pi_t__t News are often interesting
and occasionally stimulating. I
came across one last week (Jan.
20), written by Ted Colton,
which was depraved. Ted advo-
cates the purchase of Syria
Mosque and Soldiers’ and Sail-
ors’ Hall for the purpose of con-
verting them into athletic areas.

In the name of virtue,’ I hope
that Ted is reaching here for
humor. For if he is serious, his
thinking represents one of the
true black marks on right reason
since the Dark Ages.

Oakland has been known for
many years as the cultural cen-
ter, of Pittsburgh. Of the areas
of culture in Oakland, Syria
Mosque has played no small role.

-Throughout the year, the Pitts-_
burgh Symphony and other.
groups dedicate themselves to
providing someplight to a not too
bright cultural horizon.

Soldiers’_and Sailors’ Hall is
one of the few auditoriums in
the Pittsburgh area which can
accommodate large crowds for
cultural, academic, political and
other purposes.

Ted also recommends that we
destroy the world-famous na-
tionality rooms along with the
first three floors of the Cathe-
dral “of Learning” and replace
them with a parking lot to ac-
commodate the spectators who
attend the athletic contests.

Well, what about Heinz Chap-
el? Couldn’t we convert it into
an expresso house or a burlesque
theater to entertain the specta-
tors after the game?

Surely logic tells us that
enough (in fact, too much) of
the university’s revenue is spent
on football scholarships and
other athletic boondoggle. Let us
weigh our values carefully, Ted.

Don’t you think is ‘fortunate
that the Louvre h_as not been
made into a track ﬁeld or that
Aristotle was not hampered from
free intellectual thought even
though the poor chap probably
couldn’t throw a forward pass?

\ Warren W. Ashburn
Arts ’61 '

(Editor’s note: Virtue is saved!
Mr. Colton, who is completely
sane as far a's_we know, would
like Mr. Ashburn and any other
interested readers to know that
he was, in reality, “reaching
here for humor.” Mr. Colton
uiould like to know, however, if
the Louvre is in the new Con-
tinential Baseball League or the
new American Football League.)

String Quartet Praised;

Dish Droppers Hit

Editor, the Pitt News: ,

The concert given this past
Thursday was one of excellence.
The Netherlands String Quartet
played with that spirit which is
found only in great artists.

However, I _am conﬁdent that
the audience as well as the art-
ists were aware of the frequent
“noises” that arose from behind

Consequently, both artist and

Unfortunately this respect, on.

the part of the audience, was
lacking. A prominent member of

Perhaps this nervous member

sidered. .

C.’ By JACK SMITH
Tonight at the Field House,

‘ basketball fans will get their
last chance to see All-'Ameri-
can Jerry West perform. The

question in the minds of
Panther followers is, “Can
John Fridley stop West the way

'Duquesne’s George Brown stopped
.Cincinnati’s All—American Oscar

Robertson? _

' West Virginia will bring with
them a 15-1 record and a fourth
place rating by the Associated
Press, plus, if this wasn’t enough,
an All-American that holds prac-
tically _every Mountaineer record.
But, as a famous statesmen once
said, “these statistics prove to be
self evident.” ' '

It is doubtful that Fridley can
reach ‘the potential of West. Frid-
ley has had hot and cold spells
all season, but it’s not too incon-
ceivable that he could‘ match
West.

Fridley on West

Of course if Fridley should be
unable to do the job, Coach Bob
Timmons will probably pull Dar-
win Smith from the bench. If
that doesn’t work, Timmons can
always go to his hatchet 'man
Mike Ditka. Ditka is the kind of

I '’ guy that could cut West down to

size, provided he had a hatchet.
West is currently averaging
-better than 26 points per game
and is also leading the Mounties
in the rebound department with I
.16 a game. But he will not come
alone. '
Lee Patrone, who has "turned in

_ several outstanding performances,

will be there to help out West
along. with Jim’ Warren, Willie
Akers and Jim Ritchie. Man for
man, statistic-wise at least, the
Panthers seem to hold a slight
edge, that'is if West is not in-
cluded. '
Panthers Hold Ball
Penn State proved, that "a team
can be tough at home when they
almost upset the Mountaineers,
75-74. But when West Virginia
had the Lions on their home
court, they ran up over 100 points.
‘0nce again the Panthers will
~be expected to play a control
type game. “This,,’,’ said Tim-
mons, “could be as effective as
anything. Sometimes when the‘

' game gets too slow you can

hurt yourself.”

Timmons attributes the Penn
.State loss to a lack of desire. Sat-
urday the Panthers travel to New
Hampshire to play Dartmouth

Once Beaten   Gymnasts Face

Undefeated West Point‘ Squad

By LARRY HAGGERTY .

An almost impossible-task confronts Warren Neiger’s
Blue and Gold gymnastics team on Saturday afternoon when
they-journey to West Point to tangle .with Coach Tom
Maloney’s powerful and undefeated Cadet gymnasts.

Approximately four or ﬁve years ago the military offi-
cials at West Point decided that it was abouttime to provide

gymnasium ~and the surprising
fact, however, is that the Black
Knights of_ the Hudson have yet
to taste defeat in their new do-
main and don’t ﬁgure to do so on
Saturday either.

The Jungle Cats were defeated
only by Navy in their ﬁrst four
meets while victories were regis-
tered_ over Springﬁeld, West Vir-
ginia and Syracuse. '

Featuring the Panther-Army
clash on Saturday will be.\the duel
on the ﬂying rings between the
Cadet’s Eastern Intercollegiate
champion, John Aaronson, and
the Blue and Gold’s Dave Hirst
who-broke Tom Darling’s all-time
record against Navy last week.

Aaronson and Hirst met twice
last year with each performer
winning once. In the Panther-
Army dual meet at" the Field

downed Aaronson 261-245, but
at the EIGL Tournament, also
at the Field House in March, it
was Aaronson who captured the
two-day tourney by a 558-551
margin. ‘

Other gymnasts who expect to
garner points for Army against
the J ungle‘Cats include tumbler
Clark Chandler, Ralph Garens on
side horse, Dudley Taylor on the
high or horizontal bar, P-bar
specialist Jim Corcoran, and John
Kammerdiener on the robe climb.

Panther Co-captains Don Kas-
ner and Hirst, along with Earl
McConnel, plan to do most of the
scoring for the Cat gymnasts.

Kasner will work the side horse,"
high bar, and parallel bars. Other
Panther points could be scored. by
Tom Treese on the. ﬂying rings
and ropeman Howard Coley.

Bobcats from Ohio University en-
gage in a swim battle at the Car-
negie Tech pool, 8 p.m.

The Bobcats will be bringinga

in the country. Boyce swims the

Another star for 0hio’s mer-
men is Sophomore diver Chuck
Woodly.' He beat out Senior J.
Stuechell, whom Panther Coach
Ben Grady rates as a ﬁrst-‘class
diver, for the number 1 slot.
‘Sophomores Jon Sues can be
expected to give Panther sensa-
tion Jim Emert a run for his
money in _the 50 and 100-yard
freestyle races. '
~ In their last outing the Bobcats
swept eight of .the eleven events
from Western Michigan, whereas
the Cats dropped nine to Navy.

Over R ugged M ichigan

The ' Wolverines

By TED COLTON
of Michigan will provide Rex Peery’s

matmen with their toughest test of the season this Saturday
as the Panthers look for their fourth consecutive win.
Michigan has a 3-1 record competing against the top
teams in the country. Their only loss came at the hands of
Penn State, the number one team in the nation. The Wolver-

ines scored victories -over Iowa
State, the number ﬁve team in the
country, Syracuse and Ohio State.

,With seven regulars returning
from last year’s squad which was
defeated by the Panthers, 23-7,
the Wolverines are sure to give
the Cats a battle.

Two Rematches

The Blue and Gold have a good
chance to capture thepﬁrst ﬁve
matches but after that they will
be in trouble. The result of the
meet, may hinge on the 177 and
heavyweight classes.

Both of these may be return
battles between Tony Vuocolo
and Tom Hall for the. Panthers
and Karl Fink and Fred Olm.
Last . year Fink beat -Vuocolo
'7-4, and 01m drew with 2-2
Both Vuocolo and Hall are un-
defeated this year and have im-
proved a 100 per cent. _

Hall, who has been wrestling at
191 when the Cats have wrestled
eastern schools, will have to
wrestle'Bob Guzik for,the right to
make the Michigan trip. Guzik
weighs in at about 220 pounds.

M'ighty_ Mites Back
The Panthers Mighty "Mites,
Dick Martin and Larry Lauchle,
will ‘be back together after a
weeks absence. “Martin had to
miss the Navy meet because of “a

boil but will be ready for Michi-
gan. He will have to face Michi-
gan Captain Mike Hoyles, one of
their top men. .

After. three meets the Peerymen
have seven undefeated wrestlers.
