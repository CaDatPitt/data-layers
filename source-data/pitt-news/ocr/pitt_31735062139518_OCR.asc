elected president and secretary, re-
spectively, of Interfraternity Council
at the last meeting in the spring be-
fore University recognition was with-
drawn from the body, called for the
holding of a special meeting of meni-
bers of the old group to go through
the process of dissolution.

Behind the demand, it was disclos-
ed, was the contention that although
1.='niversity recognition had been with-
drawn, dissolution had never been ef-
fected. The bond of $50 which each
fraternity had been required to post
upon entering Interfraternity "Council,
also, has never been returned, nor
have any steps been taken to dispose
of the money. These bonds have been
invested by the University for the
fraternities, and have been drawing
interest which was to be passed on to
the Council.

Statement" Expected

In the event that no meeting of
Council takes place before VVednes-
day, the following statement from the
writ will obtain:

“. Pennsylvania Chi-Omicron
chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity will hold and consider the
orga.ni7.ation of the
(‘ouncil to be dissolved. and its ex-
istence terminated, and its assets
bound to be liquidated and to revert
to the fraternities (which are) mem-
bers of Interfratei'nity Council, by rea-
son of the prolonged and continued
negligence of the provisions of its
constitution and by-laws and will pre-
sent to the treasurer of Interfraternity
Council a claim for the return and

I repayment of the money bond posted

by . . . (this) chapter . . . with the
r.reasui'er of Interfraternity Council in
accordance with Article 3 of the by-
laws of the Council.”

McClain told The News Wednesday
that he did not contemplate calling a
meeting.

Resolutions Passed Monday

’l‘his move of SAE was taken at the
chapter meeting Monday night, before
its members had been informed of
(‘PSF’s intention to proceed with the
organization of a, new Council. The
resolutions which‘ were adopted at
this meeting provided that the fra-
ternity shall “undertake to secure the
formal dissolution of the Interfrater-
uity Council and the return and repay-
ment of the money bond posted by
the chapter with the Treasurer of the
Interfraternity Council” and to that
end call for the serving of the writ on
McClain and Golanty.

Even if CPSF, at its meeting last
night, voted to undertake organiza-
tion of a new I-F Council, SAE main-
tains that its action will remain in
effect.

"VVe will give sincere consideration
to any plan proposed for such an or-
ga.uiza.tion.” a member of the frater-
nity stated, “but whether or not we
would be desirous of entering such
a Council is a question to be decided
upon its merits. Since the withdrawal
of University recognition from Inter-
frateruity Council last spring, no
plan for interfraternity organization
has been submitted to the fraterni-
ties. The presidents have acted on
their own responsibility in forming
the CPSF. and it remains an organ-
ization of individuals, not fraterni-
ties.”

Men Debaters Discuss
Nationalization Of Arms

On Wednesday afternoon, Men's
Debating Association members dis-
cussed the question of munitions na-

tionalization before the Brookline di-
vision of the League of Women
Voters. James Boyle, C35, and Albert
Brandon, C36, held that the industry
should be nationalized; Edwin Banks.
C35, and Alvan lF‘oraker, C37, upheld
the negative.

The Knoxville Library club was
host to another set of debaters on
Tuesday night, at the South Hills
YMCA. The affirmative was upheld
by Sidney Kaufman, C38, and Wins-
ton l\/IcConkey, C35; James Eichel-
berger, C38, and Israel Goldberg, C36,
took the negative.

dance subject to the approval of the
plans by the SFA social committee
today.

SFA Considers
Dance Project

Frances McLaughlin Appointed
Head Of All-Wome_n’s Affair

With the appointment of Frances
McLaughlin, Ed35, as general chair-
man, the plans for the all-University
wom.en’s dance on February 9 will be
submitted to the social committee of.
SFA today.

The executive committee of the
four classes elected Miss McLaughlin
to this position after her organization
of women for consideration of a dance
to raise class funds. '

Miss McLaughlin is president of the
senior class, chairman of the academic
dress committee of WSGA, a mem-
her of Mortar Board, senior wonien’s
honorary activities fraternity, honorary
coed colonel of the ROT-C, and a mem-
ber of Theta Phi Alpha, social frater-
nity.

The ballroom of the Hotel Schenley,
an outstanding, local orchestra, and
decorations carried out in St. Valen-
tine's day style have been decided
upon. The price has been set at
$1.50 per couple.

Special permission must be ob-
tained from the social committee of
SFA so that dancing may be continued
until 1 o’clock. It is a ruling of SFA
that Saturday night dances must end
at midnight. '

If this first affair is successful, the
all-University woinen’s dance will be
made traditional and placed on the
social calendar for the school year.

Second issue Of ROTC

tion of the University cadet corps,

man, sophomore and advance -course
classes at their meeting places.

Riﬂes captain, on the advantages of
Riﬂes membership; an article by
Norman Aboosh on the arrangements
and the schedule of the basketball and
bowling leagues; and a story on the
riﬂe team by" Lee Truman, manager.

Foster Display Will Open
Tomorrow In State Hall

An exhibition of Stephen C. Foster
biographies, portraits, reproductions
of ﬁrst editions of his poetry and
songs, and views of Foster hall in In-
dianapolis will be opened tomorrow on
the third ﬂoor of State hall by J.
Howard Dice, director of the Univer-
sity library.

The display is in commemoration of
the author's death. A three-volume
folio of reproductions of ﬁrst editions
of Foster's work presented to the Uni-
versity by Josiah K. Lilly, will fea-
ture the exhibit. Mr. Dice expects
the memorial exhibit to remain on
display throughout next week.

Food For Fish
Pretty Cheap

Feeding ﬁsh apparently is one
of the cheapest affairs in the
world. George J. Dambach, gradu-
ate assistant in zoology, says that
it costs him only a quarter every
two months to feed the thousand
ﬁshes in his laboratory in the
Cathedral.

Feeding the mice and rats in
the laboratory is another matter.
They must have everything from
bread and milk to dog biscuits
and drink their water through
eyedroppers. The rats and mice
are kept on hand for any experi-
ments that come up, and until‘ 8.
year ago were being used in can-
cer investigations.

Many people come in every day,
says Mr. Dambach, to ask him
questions on how to raise food for
..the;Ir pets or how.to care for sick

ﬂsh.

wards, C-37, who was elected president

last spring, was declared ineligible :by
the point scale committee in October
because of scholastic difficulties, and
was followed in ‘office by Van Ormer,
then vice president.

The motion for removal was made
by Edwards, who submitted a list of
faults in Van Ormer’s administration.
Chief among these points were: (1)
lethargy and lack of constructive ac-
tivity on the part of the fraternity;
(2) lack of harmony in the organiza-
tion because of dissatisfaction of the
majority of membership during Van
Ormer’s presidency; and (3) the
printing of a story in The Pitt News
subsequent to the previous attempt to
impeach the president, for which Van
Ormer was blamed and which was
considered by Edwards ‘-‘contrary to
the best interests of the group.”

Edwards Moves Ouster

The motion was presented after
Van Ormcr had relinquished the chair
to Rose in order to speak from the
floor. It was carried 10-1, with two
members present not voting. During
the proceedings, Van Ormer refused
to re-accept the chair, and Rose

served as temporary chairman as a R

“disinterested party." The remain-
ing two of the 15 Druid members were
absent Tuesday,

Rose Accepts Post

,Rose immediately took office.,_...H_e
introduced three projects which the
chapter expects to undertake, but of
which no information was disclosed.

In a statement to The News, Rose
said:

“I’m sure that Druids will work
smoothly for the general good from
now on. I feel conﬁdent that we have
the support of the entire member-
ship, and our new projects, when di-
vulged, should place Druids in a dif-
ferent light in the minds of campus
cynics and dirt-throwers.”

Van Ornier has been appointed
chairman of a committee (the mem-
bership of which he will be permitted
to draw up himself) to revise the
Druid constitution.

The meeting took place at the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity house.

called for an explanation.” At Wil-
kins’ suggestion, Leonard Marks, C35,
chairman of the SFA Executive com-
mittee, produced and read the story
in question. _

Asked to clear up the subject, Wads-
worth assumed responsibility for all
direct quotations, but denied thathe
had called the Executive committee a
“pickling” body and “a brake on lib-
eral activities.” At this point Marks
relinquished the chair to George Roll,
Ed35, and entered the discussion.

Wadsworth refused to abide by
Marks’ suggestion of an apology to
the Assembly members for “an
affront to the dignity of the organiza-
tion and the implication of certain un-
truthful statements.”

“I believe an apology is unneces-
sary,” Wadsworth declared. Marks
thereupon called for a vote of censure
by secret ballot. . A suggestion for __roll
call by Dr. James C. Charlesworth,
assistant professor of political science,
was defeated.

censure Not Speciﬁc

In the secret polling, a vote of cen-
sure which did not specify the reason
for censure was declared passed.
Roll ruled out of order the request of
oger Hanson, -C36, that Hanson’s
negative vote on the motion be put
on record.

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men, reported “incomplete” his

,wo_r_k_ Ol].,~§’“pl‘0DOSed University news-

reel theater. Roll, speaking for the
Constitutions committee, promised
several proposals for the next meet-
ing.

“VVithin two or three weeks,”
Marks stated, “a committee will be
appointed to provide furniture and
ﬁxtures for the mixed lounge in the
Cathedral." John G. Quick, registrar,
explained a. new election system, and
received a unanimous vote of thanks
for providing registration aids in
working out the plan.

The ride exchange conducted just
before Christmas was reported suc-
cessful, and the Point Scale commit-
tee announced a statement “in a very
few days.”

SFA Dance

Assembly support for the ﬁrst after-
noon SFA dance on Wednesday of
next week was asked, after Wilson
Loos, C35, chairman of the Social
committee, declared that the project
would be continued only if the ﬁrst
affair is successful.

According to Roll, an intramural
sports program has been dra.wn up
by his committee. James Nicholas,
E36, was appointed to take charge of
an Assembly basketball team in the
league. Reports on recent progress
were given by the Interscliolastics,
Customs, Speakers, and Speakers Ex-
tension committees.

“Space in the Cathedral can be ob-
tained for a second-hand bookstore,
jointly sponsored by SFA and
WS~G ,” said Marks. “The store will
be opened next semester.

To Freshmen, Sophomores

And Juniors-
IN S(jAR.(‘ELY MORE than a _:tew weeks, stu-
dents will vote in c.a.iupiis—wide. clectioiis to
name 30 upperclassiiicii to seats in the U-nivc1'S1tY
Assenibly.
The l.7iiivci'sitv Asscnibly is the governing body
' 9 . L _
of the whole student associ-ation—-called thc_Stu
dent—Facultv Association——to which every register-
ed student belongs. Fifteen juniors, 110 _SeIl1C}I'S
and 10 faculty iiieiiibcrs make up the Lniveisity
Assembly. Student incnibers are elected in May
for t.ci'nis of one year. Faculty members are ap-
pointed by Chancellor Bowman.

The duties of the Universiiy Assciiibly are 11013
explicit but it seems to have legislative power

over student activities, “insofar as such povt eis do
not conflict with the authority of the faculty as

' . 1 , I .. ”
defined by the Boaid oi Tiustees. .

Some of the measures the University Assembly
has considered so far this year are: appoiiitiiient
of dance chairineii; celebratioii of football victo-
iries; revision of rules for social affairs; arrange-
ment for a series of 25-cent afternoon dances; re-
vision of its own by-laws; ll1t1‘al1l‘l11‘al basketball;
investioation of campus ncwsrecl possibilities, and
the censiiiie of one of its members. Other subjects
it niight well discuss are student living quai'tc_i's,
campus reci*cat.ional ceiitci's, student eating facili-
ties, i-cduced cost of textbooks and the assignment-
recitation system of class work. .

Vvhether you consider yourself a. candidate for a
seat in the University Assembly or only an elector,
vou should be present at the inoiithly meetings of
the Assembly. You should observe what Sl1l1)]C(13l3:
your 1‘e])1'eS€l1IaI.-IVES discuss, and you shou dre
them know what vou want tliciii to discuss. Ion
should consider drawing up a platfoi'n1 Of 370111‘
own and standing for election next May.

Come to the next nieetiiig of the Assembly. You
are not likely to see the free play_of passion, over
matters largely of personal dignity, such as
'iiiarked the session Tuesday night. But come, and
put vour representatives on their mettle.

The next meeting of the Assembly is February
12, in the Hotel Scheiiley.

The Fifth Institute

OR THE FIFTH YEAR the campus YWCA and

YWCA inaugurate their Institute on Public Af-
fairs, and delegates from the tri-state area will
register in the Cathedral this afternoon for the be-
ginning of three-day sessions on the general sub-
ject, “Tlie Christian world-view and social
change.”

The Institutes have been one of the most useful
and popular features of the YMCA and YVVCA
prograins, and attendance at the sessions is ordin-
arily swelled, towards the end of the conference,
by a number of gate-crasliers who didn’t know
about the Institute in time to register like honest
men.

If you go to the sessions this week-end, you will
achieve no progress towards your term paper, but
you will have your thinking and imagination jog-
ged—iii agreement or i'ebuttal—-on subjects that
affect your life here and now. The Institute will
probably be one of the best experiences of your
university life.

Druids Clear The Deck

UST WHAT GOES ON in Druids is about as ob-
'scure asﬁust what goes on in the Balkans, and
probably a lot less dangerous. Nevertheless the
latest. expression of Druids’ collective will, the im-

 

 

ratlier epocli-making. Van Oriner was not only
the first noii—fi'at.eriiity man in liistory to become

president of Druids, but he has the distinction of ‘-

being the only one to be ousted.

The Grand Old Party, wliicli now assiiiiics the
leadership of .DI'lll(lS, will have every chance to
make the organization what it wants to. It wants,

I say spokesmen, to justify the existence of Druids 

to the campus, and that within a month. It is sig-
iiificaiit that Yaii Orincr will be cliairniaii of the
now coiiiinittce to revise the fratcriiity constitu-
tion.

Is ‘ inibracc The Simple’
Movement ‘Over-rated’?

By Wilbur D. Clark

OU TOO, I SUPPOSE, have at times been annoyed

by the sedulity of the English departmeiit’s “Embrace
the Simple” inovement. It seems sometimes that the
privations of the pen are not worth ediﬁcation of the
-soul; that the virtue of being simple is grossly over-
rated. One spends one’s last years in high school seek-
ing out bigger and better words and then ﬁnds, after the
first dozen or so themes, that words of more than three
syllables are not to be used at this University.

“My child,” so runs the tenor of the iiis.ti'uctoi"s cute
little marginal notes, “since silence is not a material
thing, it is practically impossible to fill the space between
two hills with it; hence, your sentence ‘the valley was
ﬁlled with the silence of rushing water’ is incorrect.”

‘.‘Be yourself; do not write so uiiiiaturally. -Be simple,
little one, be simple.”

“And don't write about street cars, city streets, and
steam shovels. Write about the large out of doors, the

ﬂowers, and the small white lambkins that frisk in the ‘

stony meadow with burrs in their tails.”

It is all very irritating.

Receiitly, in an examination, one was asked to write
on the books of this or that particular type that one had
read. The answer, in this particular case was that the
writer disliked books of this sort very much and never
read them. The professor, in the margin carefully wrote
“Naine three.” Ali, it is too much.

Yes, you probably felt even worse than this when you I

got back your ﬁrst “F” theme.
It! It ll! *

To turn to other matters: It is remarkable that
extravagant measures have to be taken to prevent
students from cheating in campus elections. One
would suppose that if there is nothing to be gained

 ifinancially by being a campus politician, that few
people would take the trouble to’ cheat their’ way
into office. The only possible explanation seems to
be that Pitt has an unusually large number of ego-

tists.

The suggestion that SFA sponsors a newsreel theater
occasions comment. It must be some vastly different
sort of newsreel that is calculated to furnish entertain-
ment for college students. And it must be admitted that
students refuse to be instructed; it is amusement that
they want. The iiewsreels shown in theaters today are
probably the dullest part of the program.

Can you imagine six or seven hundred students volun-
tarily sitting in Memorial hall, or any other hall, watch-
ing movies of Army ﬂiers dropping bombs at chalk marks
on the ground?

* It I6 I39

SFA, however, should be commended for taking a
‘great stride forward: the opening of their meetings
to the general student body. This move has done
much to provide good clean fun on the campus. In
time, it is probably that the attendance. at these
meetings will grow to such an extent that this event
will take the place of the Cap and Gown show and
will have to be held in some very large auditorium.

i.Reviewing The Assembly

I

lEdi1.oi'_. The Pitt News:

It is with i‘eg‘i'et that I learii of the
‘juvenile conduct of our
§Asseii1bly at its meetiiig last Tues-
 day.

itacle to behold the august body
ii-igliteously redeeining its outraged
' dignity by forinally censuring zi mem-
ber whose name had a.ppeai‘ed in a

and that without specifyiiig the defec-
tion against which the censure was
levelled! _ _

It is indeed‘ a sorry rcniiiider to me
of the Tcleliberations of that inade-
quate “governing body" that preceded
the University Assembly, __to find the
pl'eSeDl; legislature iiidiilgiiig in the
pitfliiig by—play that occupied its at-
tention during a considerable part of
the session Tuesday evening. If the
Uiiiversity Assembly cannot discover
problems worthy of its attention in
the disrepiitable conditions in which

obliged to live; in the thoroughly un-
satisi’-act,oi'y eating facilities available
to students; in the perennially chaotic
coiiditioii of iiitei'fratcriiity relations;
in the lack of iiitegiatioii of activity
pi'og1‘aiiis;
lescence of our C'l1l‘1'lClllllIll st,i'iicture—
glheii let the University Assembly be
Qeliniinated from our design foi' collec-
ltive living. Tea-dances
gof censure can be made the responsi-
lbility of the freshman social unit and
g the debating associations, respectively.
3 The szoncern of the majority in the
;Assembly for the vindication. of the
iiiitegrity of the executive comiiiit.tee-
‘men, in the absence. of authentic
ci'it.icisni, iinpresses me as a tilting at
wiiidmills. I persona.ll:: read and cor-
rected ﬁrst and ﬁnal proofs of the
;newspapei’ story to which ret‘creiice
iwas made in the Assembly meeting,
illl accordance with a. 1'eqllll‘e111elll; im-
gposed upon the reporter that no story
‘ llll_8,’lll1 be printed which mentioned the

iwitliout first being submitted to and‘:

E approved by one of us.
least 15 items of llllSlnfOl'lllatlOi1 and
rewrote the description of student
government and legislative process.
released the story for piiblicatioii
when I was satisﬁed that no lintrue
istatements of fact remaiiied. I am
.convinced that the ~. article contains
no reﬂectioii on the C:hal‘3('.tel'_ ability,
or motives of any ineinber of the As-
senibly.

Accordingly, I regard the solemn
action of our governing; body as ill-
considered and silly. The emphasis
that was lent to the proceeding by the
chair’s appointment of a chairnian pro
tempore and his subsequent partici-
pation iii debate, it seems to me, is
especially unfortunate, inzisinucli as
complete impartiality of the presid-
ing officer is the first requisite for
confidence in the competence of any
d'elibei'a.tive body. I-am keenly dis-
appointed that the University Assem-
bly has not demonstrated a greater
stature in its seeking after projects
and problems.

=l= ='i<
Nearly two years ago, I was directed
- by interested students to take the ne-
cessary steps to secure a charter for
the Student Branch of the League for
S0Cia1 Justice; and upon the expira-
tion of the teiiiporary charter original-
ly granted, I was further authorized
to proceed to negotiate permanent
recogiiition for the organization. The

be-'iiig' no immediate prospect of fav-
orable action, I resolved to await a
more opportune time and situation.
Recently I made overtures to the
Chairman of the Organizations coni-

-mittee of the University Assembly,
preparatory to addressing to the coin-
mittee an application for a charter.
At about that. time, the University As-
sembly determined that committees
should report to its Executive commit-
tee, instead of to the Assembly in
plenary session, whereupon I with-
held action, to study the effect of the
ruling upon the procedure of applying
for a charter.

Now the University Assembly is en-
gaged in what may be politely termed
internal dissension, over the publicity
given the situation. I do not propose
that the question of chartering the
League branch shall become a politi-
cal football, nor that the Assembly or
its Executive cominittee shall feel un-
der “outside pressure” to grant the
ch'a1'ter.

So far as I am concerned, no appli-
cation for a charter for the Student.
Branch will be made at this time.

A Capitalist Contradiction

Editor, The Pitt News:

Though there is not the slightest.
truth in the suspicion that the psy-
chology depa.i't.me.nt has assumed the
role of moral giianliaii, or i'edeenici'
in orrlei‘ to guide iiidirectly the ethicail
education of the students and to show
{them the “evils of tlieir ways,” yet

,too iiiany students that seemed to be

étlie iiisidious and pai'ticiilai' design of?

lllenth by the pS_V’(‘:l10]ogy depa.1'tment,_

It. seems that in the ordinary rush
and bustle of “der SlLll.Clel1tlel)(:‘ll',"" the
student ﬁnds little time and, foi‘sootli_,
inclination, for analytical introspec-
tion into the iniierniost depths of his
soul, and sometimes wakes up all of
a sudden to ﬁnd l.l1£LlZ his actions prove
him to be a very different; and disillu-
sionine; niuinnier for the i'ndividual of
his mental rcﬂections. Torn away
froin the oi'dinai'y daily worries of un-
])l'e].l{1l’e(l assigiiment.s, evening d:.ite.s,
ioverdue room rent. he was forced to

lreﬂect for an hour on his lioncsty.
:_Many :1. stucleiit was dismayed to note
‘show often he was forced to encircle
the answer ‘freqiiently’ and ‘always’
301- ‘every chance,’ to qiiestioiis of dis-
? honest acts.

But for this reasoii, he should not
allow reinorse and despair to drive
him to suicide. Mrs. Jesse B. Rhine-
liart, who conducted the tests. lias-
tened to dispel any maiiifestatioiis of
delusions of lD.ll110l‘alll')’, assures us
that “ll/[any acts of dishonesty are
performed at some time or other by
the “best. people,” so that inany ques-
tions are not signiﬁcant. For in-
stance, the question, ‘Have you
changed an answer on a testpapei‘
after having seen someone elsc’s pa-
per?’ is not very signiﬁcant, since we
ﬁnd that almost every paper had
answered ‘frequently’ and ‘always 01'
at every chance.’

Only those questions considered sig-
niﬁcant are those to which only a few
students answered negatively. This
shows that such an act is considered
dishonest by most people in practice
and is thus abnorinal. Norfhal peo-
ple are not strictly honest. Some-
times it is foolish and stupid to be
perfectlv honest.”

Certainly one must be stupid to
“call to the attention of a bus driver

dolt who refuses to “take change
found in a pay station phone.”

Then. too, it is‘ often more vii-tuoiis
to be tactful and diploniatic at the
price of honesty. The end soinetiiues
justiﬁes the means.”

the honesty questionnaire gi'-fen last‘

the fact, that lie lia.d neglected to col-
lect your fare.” and worse still is the‘

Bt‘('.1ll‘.S9 ciioiigli data has as ye:-I. not.
been secured from diverse groiips. it

f is iiiipossililc to prove with statistical

cci'taiiity as to the relative lionesty of
dif1’ei'eiit types of people. “However.
it is 1'93.-lS0ll21l)le to siippose.' siiggesteil
l‘.Ii's. Rliiiiohart, “tliat people like mi‘.-
roziil woi‘kei's and oiigziiieers would
rate. higher in honesty than people
who are business men and thus more
exposed to dishonest iiitliie-iices."

Maiiy people. I find, are coiiviiiced
that one must be dishonest to be suit-
cessful, and some are even proud of
it. An a.t,l;oi‘ney who had taken a sim-
ilar test was greatly disappointed and
cliagrined to learn that his neiglilior
an accountant, had made a lower lion-
esty score than he had made.

This all seems to indicate to me, the
fact that all really scieritiﬁc i'cs9.a.i'cliees
acceiitiiate the fact of the glai'ii1g con-
tradictio_ns of our capitalist. society.
This honesty test ‘ really _ lll(“ilSlll‘€%;<
relative hypocrisy. One’ who received
a. low honesty score is not necessaiu
ily iiinately dishonest but is an exam-
ple of a siiccessfiil adjustment in :1
rotten decadent competitive society.
We are taught. in school, churcli and
home to be noble. To be liuinaii.
kind, helpful, and just we are told is
the highest good and the expression
of the greatest development of man
and civilization. No one can dciiy
this in fact. But because we ailmit.
this we can not escape feeling hypo-
critical; therefore we rat.ioiia.lize and
say these are but “ideals," to be nolilc
is only an ideal. And we do not al-
.low these ideals to ixifliieiicc our
actions too iiiucli. In coiitrailictioii to
our cliiircli, school and home ‘ideal’
.t(=.aClflll.l_$_:_‘ we come in contact with the

u

;pi‘actical school of experience. which
i3 0111' <.=0mDetil:.ive highly industrial-
ized society. Here v:-9 learn to rele-
gate ethical consideraitions to the
most remote places in our tliougliti-'.
The highest virtue is to be business-

like. The rutliless inliiiinan landlord
,is usually the siiccessf'ul busiiicss
lman. To turn out a fziniily who can-

liiot pay the rent is “good biisiiie.-ss.."
l'l.‘i'ul_v it is an “Aiiiericaii ti'age(l_\"'
ifor the individual who is both :l.l1ll)l-
ltious and noble—his life must be one
lof bitter frustratioii. l-Because of his
desire to live nobly, and not inc:i'el_\'
to appear noble, he ﬁnds amliitioii to
be a curse, since his goal is, by noble
endeavor, quite as uiiattainable as is
the high goal of one of limited ability.

In our present world society there
are. however, two groups of peoples
who approach most closely the ideal
of nobility. The" one type is the
typical, clean-cut Aiueiicaii 3"Ol.ll'.ll---
the “Anierican Boy’f as developed by
the YMCA’s and the Boy Scouts. _Tlll?.-‘-
type of ‘noble’ is, however, a. Sll0l‘l-
livcd species, and the sterling adinii'-
able qualities last only as long as tho.
youths are able to exist without ‘Llie.
necessity of earning‘ their own liveli-
llOO(l. As soon as this youth is pre-
cipitatcd from the unreal world of
inotlierly love, devotion and economic
security iiitothe ﬁerce struggle for

existence, his noblcness vanishes
with his youth. _
In sharp contrast is; the lzistiiirz

quality of the other type of noble as
exempliﬁed by the new generation in
Soviet Russia. Despite the “exposes”
by VVilli'a.n1 Randolph Hearst and his
colleagues of the “a.iiarcli:v' and bar-
barism rampant in the USSR,” the
communists are building up a new
order which will permit and encour-
age a. new era in intellectual, artistic.
scientiﬁc, as well as industrial enter-
prise and achievenieiitg Because of
the elimination of the coinpetitive
struggle for existence, those ideal
qualities are not only developed in
the youth to a fuller, richer degree
but are accentuated during the entire
lifetime of the individiial into the
highest moral and ethical develop-
ment.

  Panthers’ Host Tonight; J
Meet Delaware Tomorrow

 

Twelve Natators, Coach Corr, Manager Included In Party
Making 1,000-Mile Automobile Journey ‘

Swiinining entliusiasts have been known to go a long‘ way to,
take a swim, but it is unlikely that any eiithnsi-asts——n.o matter how T
eiithusiastic they might. be———wonld travel close to 1,000 miles to get
in a. couple of Swims.

That. is exactly what the Pitt swiinining team will be doing this
week-end as they travel to Laiicastcr, to meet the Franklin and Main :
shall squad toiiiglit and continue on to Newark, Delaware, to eiigag-__>,‘e

Twelve swininiers, Coach Patric.-kl Leads Swimmers i
J. Corr, aiirl Manager James Ba1lan- !
tyne left the campus at 7 o’clock this
morning on the first lap of their jour-
ney. The trip is being made by auto-
mobiles.

Those swimmers making the trip
were: Captain Jack Denny, Russell
Lindberg, Paul Stinnei‘, George Myers,
Harry Geyer. VVilliam Ruhe, Joseph
Madden, W'illiain Lewis, John Stiran-
ka, Joseph Jones, \Villiam Swazuk and
John Heid.

The Panthers defeated both F & M
and Delaware last season by wide
margins. The former meet gave the
Pantliers a 44-27 victory and the lat-
ter went on the books as 45 for the
Panthers and 14 for the Delaw-ares.

However, the fact that both these
contests were held in Pittsburgh last
year may have entered into the re-
sults. Now tliat the Panthers are on
the road, Coach Corr and his men are
not looking forward to having things
any too easy this trip.

Franklin & Marsliall’s team is re-
puted to be one of the strongest teams
in the Eastern Swiinining association.
It will be almost wholly a veteran
team that faces the Panthers. Al-

though there are only two outstand—; .A , . .

Miss Chubbuck
To Visit Campus

Recreation School Delegate Will
Interview Students

 

Miss Leah Chubbuck, 3 1'eD1'€Se11*-3‘
tive of the National Recreation school
of New York city, will visit the cam-
pus next Thursday and Friday to in-
terview senior students interested in
training for the ﬁeld of community
recreation.

The National Recreation school
trains executives and administrators
for the public and semi-public agen-
cies which have arisen in recent
years. Decreased hours of work have
increased the free time of millions of
Americans and have stimulated a de-
mand for recreation facilities and ac-
tivities.

Forty men and women, all college
graduates, are annually enrolled for
a nine 1nonths' course of. theory, dem-
onstration, and practice which covers
instruction in community, camping
and recreational problems.

Extensive ﬁeld work which is car-
ried on his many agencies in New
York city in many cases defrays part
of the student's expenses.

Senior students desiring-to get more
detailed information about the school
may meet Miss Chubbuck from 9
o'clock Thursday morning through
Friday afternoon.
