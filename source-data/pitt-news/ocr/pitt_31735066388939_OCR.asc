TUESDAY, MARCH 1, ‘I988

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

The Black Action Society announced
today that elections for chairperson and

yleputy chairperson will be held April 4

instead of the scheduled date of March I.

This decision reopens the application
period to anyone interested in either po-
sition.

According to Monique Sims, chairper-
son of the BAS, this alteration was made
after they ”received further advising and
consultation from the Office of Student
Activities and the elections and steering
committees.

”We received a lot of questions from
students and the Office of Student Af-
fairs,” said Sims. ”We felt that we need-
ed to make the election as crystal clear
as possible.”

At last Wednesday's ”Meet the Candi-
dates” assembly, only one candidate was
presented on the ballot for each position,
Rodney Howerton for chairperson and
Maria Kersey for deputy chairperson. Ac-

cording to BAS election rules, these can-
didates were ruled ineligible because of
incomplete ”packets” that they had sub-
mitted.

office must be a full-time, undergraduate
student with a QPA of at least 2.5. Can-
didates must also have a minimum of 36
credits and a maximum of 95 credits
received at Pitt (main campus). They must
be a registered member of the BAS and
be ”active" in the organization. They are
further required to have three letters of
recommendation and a petition contain-

VOLUME EIGHTY-TWO, ISSUE EIGHTY-SEVEN

BAS reviews candidates and reschedules election

mg 100 signatures. The packets must fi-
nally include an official transcript, a photo
and a 50-word or less summary of intent.
These credentials were required to be
submitted to the BAS office by Feb. 22.

Sanders said Howerton was ruled in-
eligible because he was considered ”not
active” under the election committee's
rules, while Kersey fell short of eligibility
because she only had two recommenda-
tions in her applications packet.

After considerable debate, BAS mem-
bers decided to allow Howerton and Ker-
sey to run uncontested in the election as
scheduled on March 1.

Sims said that originally, the BAS didn't
want to postpone the election process any
further, thus delaying the training of the
new officers.

”They [future officers] might be miss-
ing one to two weeks training. Melanie
[Berg, deputy chairperson] and I will be
around, though, for a while this summer,
so we'll be able to help them out.”

According to Sims, the new packets for
applicants will be available on March 3.

The deadline for packet submission will
be March 30 at 3 p.m.

. Sims and Sanders said that a cover let-
ter stating the necessary criteria is includ-
ed in the new packets to hopefully avoid
the confusion that hindered the previous-
ly scheduled election.

”The secretary will verbally go over the
packet when any student comes in to pick
one up,” said Sims. ”Before the election,
we will call a meeting to go over the pack-
et again. We are also planning to hold
another ‘Meet the Candidates.’ Just so it's
as clear to them [the applicants] as it is
to us.”

Sims and Sanders also mentioned that
the BAS is examining other ways to select
their officers.

"We had a lack of communication be-
tween Black History Month and the elec-
tion,” said Sims. ”So much is going on
at that time that we are thinking about
changing the term of the officers."

”The decision [to allow Howerton and
Kersey to run] wasn't totally had,” said
Sanders. "We had a good intent.”

As ”Super Tuesday" ap-
proaches, the nation prepares
to draw its final conclusions
on the remaining Presidential
Candidates.

Throughout the primaries,
arguments have been made
that the attention of the voter
is focusing on personality, as
opposed to the issues for
which he stands.

At an open forum held
yesterday in David Lawrence
auditorium, Dr. Dennis Brutus
of the Department of Black
Community Education
Research and Development,
said the issues needed to be
confronted by candidates.

”The problem with the
presidential campaigns was
that they focused on the in-
dividuals and personalities in-
stead of the issues,” said
Brutus.

The Black Action Society
and the Department of Black
Community Education
Research and Development
co-sponsored the forum.

The program included a
panel of professors and stu-
dents who discussed their
views of particular candidates.

Each member of the panel
was given a ten and five
minute time limit to speak on
various issues confronted by
the '88 presidential can-
didates.

Brutus was the first to take
the podium and spoke on
AIDS, Contra aid, the Deficit,
Education, and the Budget.
”We have gone from the
world's number one creditior
to the world's number one
debtor.”

’’wishful thinking and easy
solutions that don't cut the
problem,” is how presidential
rhetoric Professor Ted Windt
described all the candidates’
plans for eliminating the
deficit.

In addition, he said that on
certain issues they have been
neither ”specific nor realistic.”

After summing up his opin-
ions on the matters facing so-
ciety, Professor Ladun Anise of
the Department of Black
Studies ended his remarks

with ”You are Americans, may
you be wise."

Political Science student
Elaine Marie Adams said she
supported Jesse Jackson's in-
terest in education. She said,
”The future depends on edu-

cation."

The final speaker was BAS

The March of Dimes has
launched a new campaign aimed
at raising women's awareness
about the effects of AIDS and
other sexually transmitted dis-
eases upon unborn babies.

The campaign is targeted at

warns expectant mothers of AIDS effects

women of childbearing age and
is focused on AIDS because it is
the fastest growing of the STDs
and the most dangerous to un-
born babies.

David Tucci, director of Com-
munity Services for the March of
Dimes, said, ”Our purpose is to
make the public aware of this
problem, the hidden side of the

problem, the children.  We ex-
pect about 3,000 infants born
with AIDS by 1991.”

Tucci said that all women who
think that they have AIDS should
be tested. Heexplained that the
danger is great because ’’all too
often, when you think about
AIDS, only intravenous drug
users and homosexuals are

thought of."

The campaign was designed to
deliver some important mes-
sages. First, women who fear they
have been exposed to AIDS
should be tested for the virus be-
fore they become pregnant be-
cause it can be passed on to an
unborn child. Most babies born
infected with AIDS do not live

beyond the first few years of life.

Tucci said that other STDs,
such as Herpes, have not been
receiving as much attention.
”Herpes has taken a back seat to
AIDS, but it is still a high-risk sit-
uation.”

Also, other STDs such as
gonorrhea, syphilis and

Baby M's real mom seeks unlimited visits for now

HACKENSACK, N.J. —— The at-
torney for Baby M's natural father
said Monday that the natural
mother is seeking unrestricted ac-
cess to her daughter between
now and a March 28 visitation
hearing.

Gary N. Skoloff, attorney for
William and Elizabeth Stern, said
he would have no comment on
the motion, which he said sought
unsupervised visits for Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould.

Harold J. Cassidy, the attorney
for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, was
not immediately available for
comment. He was not in his
office, a secretary said.

Skoloff said he received a copy
of the motion today, but a clerk
for Superior Court Judge Birger
Sween, who will preside over the
final hearing to determine final
visitation rights, said the judge
had not yet processed any such
motion.

Skoloff said meetings last week
between the two sides failed to
produce any resolution.

”We met, we talked last week,
and could not solve anything,”
Skoloff said, declining to say
when or where the two sides

talked.

The Supreme Court voided a
surrogate motherhood contract
for pay in a ruling Feb. 3. Under
terms of a $10,000 contract,
Whitehead—Gould agreed to be
artificially inseminated with
Stern's sperm and bear him a
child. No money ever changed
hands.

The child is now legally called
Melissa Stern.

The court gave a Superior
Court judge 90 days to decide
visitation if the parties could not
reach an independent agreement.

murder-suicide case

VERONA, Pa. —— People who

he danced with his wife at the lo-

likely.

Pittsburgh.

Mary Radakovich, 57, was
found on the livingroom floor.
One son, James L., 21, was in his
bed, and the other son, Paul, 19,
was lying on the floor of the
bedroom he shared with his
brother. All died of multiple gun-
shot wounds, according to the Al-
legheny County coroner's office.

Radakovich, 54, a retired steel-
worker, died of a single gunshot
wound in the head and was
found lying beside his youngest
son, authorities said. He had two
notes in a pocket of his pajamas:
one a will, the other burial in-
structions for his brother,
Bernard.

”The note said he was sorry for
what he is doing, but possibly
they would all be better off,
wherever they were going. But it
gave no reason,” said Ber-
gamasco.

Investigators found no signs of

struggle.
’’It struck me as an orderly kind
of thing,” the officer said.

Group says toxins
invading food supply

WASHINGTON -— Airborne
toxic substances are reaching the
Great Lakes from as far away as
India, entering the food chain and
possibly endangering the health
of millions of people, environ-
mental groups said Monday.

’’It is bad enough to have to
breathe toxic air pollution
without having to eat it, too.
We're here to urge [the Environ-
mental Protection Agency] and
Congress to clean up our skies, so
we can breathe and eat safely in
the Great Lakes region again,”
said Jane Elder, Midwest
representative of the Sierra Club,
at the start of a week of lobbying
on lakes issues.

A draft report summarizing re-
cent research, prepared by the
Sierra Club and Great Lakes Unit-
ed, said up to 90 percent of some
toxic substances entering the
Great Lakes come from the air,

Clayton lost a Supreme Court ap-

the sentencing trial so Clayton's

Smith and
Core lead

~Pitt over

BC, 87-79

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

The Big East has taken steps to
curb fighting in league games, but
that hasn’t stopped players from
using incidents on the court as
motivation.

Pitt forward Demetreus Gore
did just that in Pitt's 87-79 win
over Boston College at Fitzgerald
Field House last night.

Gore caught an elbow from
Steve Benton early in the second
half and responded with his
jumper—-not his fists. He scored
14 second-half points and
finished with a Big East season-
high of 20.

”[Benton] caught me with an
elbow in the mouth. I don't know
if it was intentional. But when
you get hit in the mouth you get
fired up. I was fired up,” Gore
said.

Pitt withstood a 32-point per-
formance from Dana Barros, two
Paul Evans’ technicals and 11
three—point Boston College field
goals to win its 14th consecutive
game at the Field House.

”The three-point field goal has
definitely kept a lot of teams in
games this year. Dana Barros is
out there to shoot the three-

pointer,” Pitt center Charles
Smith said.
Barros made 6-of-10 th ree-

point shots. Jamie Benton added
two treys and Steve Benton also
had two. Both players finished
with 14.

”We knew it would be a tough
game if Barros was hitting,” Gore
said.

Pitt is 11-3, in the Big East, a
game ahead of Syracuse (10-4).
Pitt, ranked seventh by the As-
sociated Press, is 21-4 overall.

The seventh-place Eagles end
the regular season with a 6-10
conference mark, and a 15-12
overall record.

”All games in the league have
been relatively close the whole
season. Except for a few games,
there haven't been any

Boards ’n
buckets
put Smith
at No. 2

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Charles Smith entered last
night’s game against Boston Col-
lege needing 22 points to move
into second place on the all-time
Pitt scoring list. '

He got 23.

Smith's free throw with :15 se-
conds remaining moved him past
Larry Harris, and he now trails
first place Clyde Vaughan by 117
points.

"It feels real good,” said the
6-foot-10 Smith, who's eight
boards placed him second on the
Panther all-time rebounding list
as well. ’’But 1 can't relax. I want
to be the No. 1 scorer.

Coach Paul Evans ac-
knowledges the type of play
Smith has given the team since
he's been here, so much so that
he considers Smith the nucleus of
the team.

”He's the one we center
around,” said Evans. ”We want
to go to him first, but he proved
he could move it around -- the
way he passed it around to Sean
[Miller].

”He can handle the ball on the
reverse or in the transition game
—- that's why he hit the three-
pointer. He'd been O-for-4 on the
season and there were a couple
of plays where he could have hit
them,” added Evans.

Smith enjoyed the fact that he
made his first 3-pointer in his
career, but a few possessions
later, he had the chance again,
but passed it away. ’’I felt good
about the second one, but I don't
know why I didn't take it.

Smith, aside from being second
all-time in scoring and rebound-
ing at Pitt, also passed former St.
John's standout Chris Mullin as
the Big East's all—time free throw
attempt leader with nine attempts
last night, hitting eight. Smith
now has 434 attempts, scoring on
325 of them (75 percent).

Mullin had previously attempt-
ed 430, missing 60.’

Demetreus Gore's pompous new
basketball rap, ”Pitt Has Ar-
rived”: Take it one game at a

Word, don’t count your chickens

were they are now, but the top-
ranked Owls just don’t have the
bench strength to handle what
they're gonna run into every time
they step on the court during the
NCAAs

0 Counting this past Sunday's
106-101 defeat, the aging Boston
Celtics have now lost eight con-
secutive games to the Detroit
Pistons in the Detroit Silverdome.
That, my friends, could become

a very interesting bit of informa-
tion come NBA playoff time, es-
pecially in terms of maybe
finding someone other than the
Celtics representing the Eastern
Conference against the Lakers or
Rockets in the league finals.

0 Best word to descibe how the
Pittsburgh Penguins are playing
right now: Ewwwwwwwwww.

0 For those of you who some-
how missed yesterday's sports
transactions, the Minnesota
North Stars, the lousiest team in
the NHL at 17-38-9, recalled
defenseman Manny Viveiros
from their farm team in Kalama-
zoo. Boy, I'll betcha they're just

going bonkers in Minnesota now
that ”Manny Who? From Kalama-
zoo” is on the scene.

0 Against Kentucky on Sunday,
the Syracuse Orangemen wore
blue away-uniforms, as opposed
to the traditional orange—colored
ones, for the first time since 1975.
Considering Syracuse's 17 turn-
overs and atrocious foul shooting,
I'm guessing that Orangemen
head coach Jim Boeheim will
claim that it was a team called the
Syracuse Bluemen who lost
62-58 to the Wildcats, and there-
fore, will hold no responsibility
whatsoever for what transpired at
Rupp Arena.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March I, I988

By Alan Robinson
A!’ Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. —— He was
13-6, averaged nearly eight in-
nings per start, was second in the
National League in earned run
average and was the league's
rookie pitcher of the year.

His teammates were so im-
pressed by his cool—under-fi re at-
titude and unrookie-like poise
that they nicknamed him
”Iceman."

But Pittsburgh Pirates right-
hander Mike Dunne still can't
help but to think all the hoopla
and attention weren't a bit, well,
overdone.

’’It couldn't have been me be-
cause I only strike out three guys
a game,” Dunne said. "There

cause it wasn't me personally. I
threw the sinkers, and they hit the
ball. I'm just glad they hit them
to us.”

Catcher Mike LaValliere is
glad, too, because he had about
as much success handling
Dunne’s sinkers as the hitters did.

"He came up here on June 5
from the minors and started pitch-
ing just like a veteran,” said
LaVal|iere, who was traded with
Dunne and outfielder Andy Van
Slyke to the Pirates for catcher
Tony Pena last April.

’’It’s funny because I never
caught him last spring with St.
Louis, so all I knew was that he
had a good sinker. I got a good
indication the first time I caught
him when I dropped the first
seven he threw.”

himself, perhaps because the
former Bradley University pitch-
er from Bartonville, I|l., never en-
visioned himself failing.

"It didn't really hit me that I
was pitching in the big leagues,”
he said. "I mean, my gosh, when
you come up, you're supposed to
win, you're not supposed to fail.
You don't say, ‘I'm a rookie, I'm
supposed to fail, so it's OK if I
do.’ "

Even in the few starts he didn't
pitch well, Dunne, 25, never dis-
played frustration or anger -—— or
let himself become undone.

’’I'm pretty much the same
everywhere," he said. ”That’s
just me, that's my makeup. It
makes it easier when you pitch
because if you get ripped one
day, you don't let it bother you,
and the other team can't pick up
on that. And if you do well, you

don't change, you don't start
pretending it's a World Series
game out there.

”But the way I am  it doesn't
help you win a game. You've got
to have the stuff and the defense
to do that.”

An avid baseball card collector
—- he has every full set of Topps
cards issued since 1972 -
Dunne did admit feeling a ’’little
in awe of some of the hitters. I'd
say, ‘Hey, this is Mike Schmidt.
This is Darryl Strawberry.’

"But what I realized is that up
here, you can make some mis-
takes and still get by with them.
You don't have to be perfect with
every pitch. I was always told,
’You hang that pitch in the big
leagues, and it's out ofthere.' It's
hard, but it's not that hard.”

But while few National League
pitchers did it better than Dunne

‘Iceman’ gives ’mates credit for success

last season —— only Nolan Ryan
had a better ERA among starters
— he knows he can get even
better.

"You can always get better on
things like holding runners on;
you can have better control,”
Dunne said. "You don't want to
let fundamentals beat you now
that you've shown you've got the

talent to win. You've got to keep?

that solid base, and you can
never work enough on that.”

Dunne is sure the Pirates can
get better, too. When his team-
mates were celebrating and
throwing their hats in the stands
last year, after exitinglast place
for the first time in four years,
Dunne characteristically failed to
show much emotion.

’’I just know that finishing in
fourth place stinks," he said.

Gonzalez’s absence costly to
gymnasts in loss to Ohio State

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
traveled to Ohio last Friday to
take on third-ranked Ohio State.
Pitt was defeated 281 .85-245.05.

The Panthers competed
without one of their top all-
arounders, Jorge Gonzalez, who
missed the meet because of ten-
donitis in his shoulder.

Head coach Frank D’Amico

said, ’’It wasn't a bad loss.
Without Jorge, the team held
tight. We had good, clean sets.

"We had some major breaks.
I think we need to polish up our
act on the floor exercise. But
overall, the routines were done
quite well.

”The crowd was very en-
thusiastic and supported us,”
D’Amico added.

Some of the players agreed that
the team did come together well,

”We did pretty well. We pulled
together in some areas that were
weak. Ohio State displayed a
good caliber of gymnastics,” said
David Barsky.

’’I feel that we're hanging in
and doing real well with all of our
injuries. Hopefully when we get
some of our guys back, we'll
show them what we really can
do,” said David Hasselbrook.

”We did a really good job con-
sidering Jorge wasn't in. We
found out what we have to work
on and how important it is to hit
our routines," said Chris
O’Lough|in.

"This meet was good because
it showed us some of our weak-
nesses and prepared us for the
Great Lakes Championships,” ad-
ded Pat Pollaci.

This Saturday, Pitt hosts the
Great Lakes Championships at
Trees Hall. In addition to Pitt,
there will be four other teams
competing: Eastern Michigan,
Kent State, Radford and William

Preliminaries will start at noon,
and finals will begin at 7 p.m.

blowouts," Smith said.

Smith scored 23 points and
grabbed eight rebounds and
moved up in several record
catagories. He passed Larry Har-
ris to move into second-place on
the all-time Pitt scoring list with
1,916 points.

Smith was 8-for-9 from the line.
He broke the Big East record for

by former St. John's guard Chris
Mullin. Smith now has 434.

He also passed Harris and
moved into second-place in Pitt's
all-time rebounding department
with 940 boards.

Smith moved into third-place in
all-time Big East scoring with
1,004 points.

Now back to the game.

At halftime, the score was tied
at 38. The Panthers built 11-point
leads on two occasions early in
the second-half, but the pesky Ea-

‘V gles kept close because of Barros.

The 5-foot-9 junior scored 17
second-half points. His consecu-
tive three-pointers cut Pitt's 64-51
lead to seven with 8:58 left.

Pitt got the lead back to 9,
71-62, but Bobby Moran hit a
three-pointer to cut the deficit to
SIX.

The Eagles came within five,
75-70, on a three-point play by
Barros at 3:07. Boston College
freshman Doug Able was given a
technical for hanging on the rim.
Sean Miller, whose consecutive
free-throw streak came to an end
on his previous attempt, hit the

Smith also had four blocked
shots in the game, giving him at
least one blocked shot in 46 con-
secutive games and 106 of the
last 107. He now has 77 on the
season and 327 career blocks,
another Pitt record.

Tomorrow night's game against
Seton Hall will mark the last time
Smith and fellow senior De-
metreus Care will play at Fitzger-
ald Field House. After last night's
game, Smith doesn't know how
he will react to his last home
hurrah.

"It's the last game at the Field
House, but I don't know how
emotional I'll be.

”Overall, looking back on my
career at Pitt, I'm pleased. I've im-
proved statistic-wise. I've had a
lot of good games and I've had a
lot of bad ones," said Smith.

For this season however, Smith
would like to see the most impor-
tant goal accomplished. "If we
make it to the Final Four, I'll be
pretty satisfied."

One person already satisfied
with the contribution Smith has
made to the entire Panther pro-
gram is Miller.

"There are not too many guys
in the country I'd rather play
with," Miller said. "In fact,
there's no one else I'd rather play
with. He's a great player and a
great person."

 

foul shot. Gore followed with a
17-foot jumper pushing the Pitt
lead to eight, 78-70.

After the Eagles lost the ball out
of bounds, junior forward Jerome
Lane caught Boston College nap-
ping with an uncontested dunk,
putting the finishing touch on the
win.

Lane finished with nine points
and seven rebounds.

Miller was 4—of-6 from three-
point range, finishing with 16
points and a career-high 11
assists.

Darelle Porter, starting his se-
cond game in place of Jason Mat-
thews, added 10 for the Panthers.

Evans said he doesn't know
how to inject his team with a
killer punch. "Not unless I can
get some guerilla milk,” he said.

In the first-half, Pitt hit seven of
its first eight shots and jumped to
an early 11-7 lead. Smith's three-
point basket (the first of his
career) extended Pitt's lead to
14-7, forcing Boston College to
call a timeout at 16:36.

Porter's steal and dunk, and
Lane's two foul shots made the
score 18-7. It looked like the rout
was on.

But Barros slowly led the Eagles
back into the game.

Barros, the Big East's leading
scorer, had 15 points in the

first—half.

Evans didn't help Pitt's cause
either, picking up two technicals.

The first came at 6:38 when
Evans thought Smith had been
fouled, but didn't get the call.
Official Bob Donato hit Evans
with the ‘T’. Barros hit the two
foul shots, pulling Boston College
within four, 29-25.

’'I wanted the technical. The
crowd was dead and we were
dead," Evans said.

Pitt got the lead back to seven
but Jamie Benton hit a three-
pointer making it 32-28.

Moments later, Steve Benton
hit a trey, cutting the Panthers
lead to 34-33.

Gore hit a bankshot, Lane
scored inside from Bobby Martin
and the lead was five, 38-33.

With 2:48 left, Nate Bailey was
called for a foul on a Steve Ben-
ton jump shot. Evans exploded
again. This time Jodi Sylvester hit
him with the ‘T’. Benton made
one of two foul shots, Barros
made one of two technical foul
shots and he hit a three-pointer
with 10 seconds left, tying the
game at 38.
