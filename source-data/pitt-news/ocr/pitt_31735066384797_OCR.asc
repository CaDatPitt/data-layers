Pitt Staff Votes To Reject Union Representation

SEIU Representation is
Rejected By 2-1 Margin

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s clerical and technical staff
voted yesterday to reject repre-
sentation by local 925 of the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) by a better than two-to-one
margin. -

More ‘than 85 percent of the
eligible voters turned out despite
rainy conditions throughout the
day. _
The ﬁnal tabulation showed 874
workers voted “no” to unionization
(59 percent of the total vote) while
411 voted for representation by local

~ 925.

Assistant vice-ch|ancellor for
human resources Gus Reincke said
he was pleased with the results.

“I expected it,” he said. “It
(union elections) is one of those
situations that you have to go
through. I'm pleased with the
outcome.”

Union v spokesperson Karen

Nussvaum said the local union may
contest the election because of
politicking and the distribution of
anti-union literature by the Univer-
sity on election day.

Nussvaum said the University
“issued leaflets and memos”
throughout campus of “slander-
ous” nature against the union.

“The University’s tactics today
were completely illegal,” she said.

N ussvaum had said earlier in the
day that the union planned on
“challenging” votes by conﬁden-
tiary and/ or supervisory workers if
the election was close. Supervisory
workers are those who direct work

‘and confidentiary workers are those

who handle sensitive information.
Nussvaum saidthere were 200 such
persons employed at Pitt.

“The practice .of challenging
votes is quite common, though,”
she said. i

There were actually 196 votes
termed “contested” by Pennsyl-

Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board members counting ballots last night in Benedum auditorium. Pitt staff
workers voted by a two to one margin to reject representation by the Service Employees International Union

ofﬁcials after the ballots were
counted last night plus three
void/ blank votes—but the total was
not enough to effect the outcome of
the election.

Yesterday’s election marked the

second time in three years that staff
workers rejected representation by
a union. In 1976 unionization was
overwhelmingly rejected by a 62
percent margin.

Yesterday’s outcome was the
result of vigorous campaigning by

The College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) Council moved

Tuesday to accept an amended
proposal from the life science
department to decrease the number
of laboratory hours for each of the
four core-requisite courses in the
departmental major.

After lengthy discussion involv-
ing representatives of the Biological
Science Majors Association and
faculty members, the Council voted
to accept the bill with its calling for
the solicitation of more student
input on the changes by the life
science department.

The proposal eliminates one-
credit labs accompanying Life
Science 11, 12, 20 and 21, replacing
them with a pair of two-credit labs
offered only after the completion of
Life Science 11 and 12 and one after
Life Science 20 and 21.

Nancy Bitar, a life science major,
and Ann Ciss, president of the life

science majors, said they approve of
the curriculum change. _

Bitar said she forsees no
problems in combining the labs for
any of the courses.

“In Life Science 12 several labs
are devoted to recitations covering
genetic problems, but several
others are devoted to the playing of
a type of game dealing with
evolution,” Bitarsaid. “And the
new curriculum would allow for the
needed recitation time as well as the
laboratory time.”

Why the life science department
failed to contact life science
majors—an issue that has re-
peatedly put a stopper on the
passage - of the proposal—was
answered by Chris Marchioni, a
student representative, who called
for an amendment requiring the
department to consider the input of
the departmental majors before
finalizing the change.

Universitysencite Elects New Officers

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The University Senate's ﬁnal
meeting of the 1977-78 school year
last Friday afternoon was high-
lighted by an election of new
officers and a report from its
outgoing president, Hibberd Kline,
on poor attendance at Faculty
Assembly meetings this past year.

‘ ‘Assembly members should take
their responsibilities more serious-
ly,” Kline said.

Kline reported that quorums
were not reached at some of the
meetings, restricting the amount of
business the assembly was able to
undertake.

Chancellor Posvar also warned of
the lack of attendance.

“We might consider these
meetings in the future as an open
forum." Posvar said. “We should

.-- - m»....,........._... ,,

not be concerned that this meeting
is one in which we should pass
resolutions.”

Posvar added that a committee
may be created to explore ways of
increasing attendance.

The assembly was created last
year as a forum in which faculty
members may express their views
on University issues.

Kline warned that unless attend-
ance picked up in the future the
removal of frequently absent
members could be inititated.

The assembly’s next meeting is
slated for June 20.

For Kline, Paul L. McLain, the
Senate vice-president, and Eileen
Hunkele, the secretary, it was the
last Senate meeting as officers, as

_election results for the new school

year were reported by Allen Janis.

N professor of physics.

David E. Engel of the School of
Education was elected president
for the '78-79 year, while Mary Ann
Scialabba, health related profes-
sions. was chosen as vice president
and Richard C. Tobias, professor of
English, was elected. secretary.

McClain also announced his
retirement from the Pitt faculty.

Posvar presented a summary of
the events of the winter term and
spring session to date, including
last month's $25 tuition hike
passed by the Board of Trustees
and the situation with regard to
state appropriations for Pitt.

“We are going to get a budget
passed and signed," he said. “We
are cautiously optimistic that we
will get the four percent increase.”

The State “Senate Tuesday

passed the budget for non-prefer-
red appropriations_—including a
five percent increase for Pitt
amounting to $63.1 million in aid.
The budget must next be approved
by Governor Shapp.

Posvar also reported that search
committees for a new clean of the
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
of admissions-student aid are near
completion. Robert Marshall is the
current CAS dean and Sam Deep is
the temporary director of admis-
sions.

A search committee to find a
replacement for Al Moye, former
vice chancellor for student affairs,
will continue to work throughout
the summer. Moye recently ac-
cepted the position of deputy
commissioner of the Bureau of
Higher and Continuing Education.

CAS Council ApprovesReduced Biology Laboratory Hours

(Continued from Page I )
economics, challenged the amend-
ment, referring to a memorandum
dated April 1977, which was issued
from the life science department
requesting undergraduate majors,
faculty members and others in the
department to ﬁll out a comprehen-
sive questionnaire concerning a
number of departmental changes.

No life science major in

attendance had ever completed the

form because it was distributed

‘ during the spring term, a time when

many students are off campus.

“We (the Council) didn’t raise
the question of student input, ” said
CAS Dean Robert Marshall, “but
they said they had contacted
students, and, as of yet, we haven’t

been able to ﬁnd a single student
that had been contacted.”

In other business, the Council
continued its discussion of the
University Honors Program (UHP)
and its effectiveness. The discus-
sion followed a presentation by
UHP director Alex Stewart at a prior
meeting of the progress of the
six-month-old program.

‘Several Council members ques-
tioned what qualiﬁcations consti-
tute membership in UHP.

“There is no such thing as
membership in the program,”
Marshall said. “A student who has
above a 3.25_ QPA and special
permission from the course in-
structor is only elligible to register
for honors courses, not for induction
into any sort of club.”

Chesler added that the deﬁnition
and goals of the UHP are not clearly
deﬁned, especially to prospective
students and their parents in
addition to students already en-
rolled in the University.

‘ ‘UHP is concerned» with bringing
the best students in contact with the
best faculty,” said Jack Daniel,
associate CAS dean. “In that sense
you might say that UHP, is
concerned with giving special
attention to students with special
abilities. ’ ’

Daniel urged Council members
concerned with changing the UHP
curriculum to contact the program
director.

The Council drafted a list of

. points to be clariﬁed for submission

to UHP prior to next week's
meeting. The list includes:

—The deﬁnition of UHP course
with particular attention to the
prerequisites.

—The difference between a UHP
course and a departmental honors
course.

—The description of the criteria
for selection of students and faculty.

—The description of or formula-
tion of a statement of philosophical
purpose.

—To make the effort for
compartmentalization of knowledge
referring to the development of an
intellectually stimulating struc-
tured environment.

—The extent to which the

advisory board may provide for a
general upgrading for the beneﬁt of
all students of the institution.

Marshallexpressed concern that
the institution of the Honors
Program might have occurred
mainly for recruiting purposes or
because of requests by faculty
members who were seeking to teach
only top-ability students.

“We should focus our attention
on developing a program or
curriculum suited to the needs and
desires of the students, not the
faculty, ” Chesler said.

“And as far as recruiting goes,”
Marchioni said, “Pitt is not going
to get the Harvard or Yale students
in UHP simply because it does not
have that type of reputation.”

Tax Reform For Pennsylvania ?

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—Two Pennsylvania lawmakers spurred by the
tax revolt victory in California, renewed their efforts yesterday to
bring about tax and spending reforms.

State Representative Lee Taddonio, R-Allegheny, again proposed
that a constitutional amendment be placed on the ballot to limit the
amoun: of state spending. And State Senator John Stauffer,
R-Chester, beefed up his efforts to eliminate property taxes in

“This really is the only way that the Legislature can say no to
anybody. If the system is allowed to drift by itself, it will keep
spiraling upward,” said Taddonio, who introduced a similar
proposal in 1973 that went nowhere.

Taddonio’s proposal will be referred to committee and won’t be
taken up until the summer legislative recess is over. However, it
could possibly appear on the ballot by next spring if both houses

“The time is ripe now. The taxpayers are quite upset,” said
Taddonio, who said eight cents of every dollar earned goes to state

Inflation Checks Given Three-month Test

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON-—President Carter’s chief inﬂation ﬁghter said
yesterday that people should expect results from the voluntary price
and wage restraint program by the end of the summer.

Robert S. Strauss, who also serves as the Administration’ s special
trade ambassador, declined, however, to say the program should be
judged a failure if there is no progress in three months. Strauss
added that he is encouraged by the cooperation the program has V

At a breakfast meeting with reporters, he also declined to predict
the specific results expected in the next few months.
“I hope there will be a substantial business support in 60 to 90

Carter’s anti-inflation program is aimed at reducing the rate of
inflation by one-half of one percentage point a year through efforts
to hold wage and price increases below the levels of the past two

Strauss disclosed that he has sent Carter an inﬂation
memorandum that outlines a framework for the anti-inﬂation
program for the next six to 12 months. He said it suggests ways to
extend the anti-inﬂation program to the state and local level and to
drum up additional nationwide support for it.

Pitt long-distance runner Gary
Siriano will go home to Houston in a
few weeks. — . \
Siriano, a Pittsburgh native
before moving to Houston with his
family last year, plans to do some
serious training in preparation for
Pitt's cross country season next fall.
“I’m going to run seven or eight
miles a day,” he said. “I’ll run in
the morning and the late evening.

And rest in the afternoon, when it’s
really hot.

“I also plan to go to Arkansas at
least once and run in the Ozarks,”
he continued. “Running there, I’ll
be ready to come back to
Pittsburgh with all the hills.”

Siriano, who recorded a personal
best 4:06 in the 1,500-meter run at
the Central Collegiate Champion-
ships, xwants to trim a few more
seconds from that time this
summer.‘

Siriano Set for Some Serious Training Se

“That’s my goal,” Siriano said.
“For the past three years or so, I’ve
chopped about six seconds off my
time. My best time before I got the
4:06 was a 4:08 in this year’s Penn
Relays.”

Siriano ﬁgures he’ll have his work
cut out for him.

‘ ‘Thefaster you run, the harder it
is to improve. I don’t know why, but
it seems once you reach 4:05 or 4:06

it becomes really tough to keep

With long-distance men Mel
Boyd, Dave McDonald and Tom

cast into a new role—that of team

nati has won 12 of 17 games.

The streak has kept the Reds in
hot pursuit of the pitching-rich
Giants, who lead the NL West by a
half-game over Cincinnati.

“What’s good right now is that
We’re able to mark time, ’ ’ Anderson
said. “Despite our injuries, we’re
not getting hurt in the standings.
That’s the greatest thing going for
us right now. We’re hanging right
in there with first place San
Francisco—and we’ve gained
ground on the Dodgers.”

Over the weekend Anderson said
Los Angeles couldn’t afford to fall
more than 4‘/2 games behind the
division leaders. The Dodgers now
trail San Francisco by 5% games.

“They could be in trouble,” he
said. “And, if we give San
Francisco enough room, they’ll get
real brave. That’s what happened
last year when we gave the Dodgers
too much room and they got away
from us.”

Though they trail, the Reds are
running ahead of the pace they set
in 1975 and 1976 when they won 108
and 102 games on the way to
consecutive world championships.

“We’re showing signs of ,the

George Foster, who is off to
another strong start.

The Reds have come from behind
in 16 of their 32 victories and have
won 13 of 20 one-run games.

“That’s how we did it in 1975 and
1976, but last year teams were
doing it to us. Now we have quality
arms, both as starters and in the

“When we had our good years,
we had guys coming off the bench
and playing well when we needed
it,” he said. “Right now We’re
forced into it, and doggone if it isn’t
working. The regulars are darn,
thankful this team has played as
well as it has.”
