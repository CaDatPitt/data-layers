Awardee Studies
French Literature
In summer School

By DONNA CONSIDINE

Chivalry really isn’t dead,
at least not in Europe.

This was an impression
which Carolyn Mazur, recipi-
ent of the 1957 French Com-
mittee Travel and Study

Award, carried with her during
her summer abroad.

In describing the hospitality of
the Europeans, she declared,
“They’re always willing to help

you. I never had to get my lug-
gage down from the rack on
trains.”

People Helpful

She went on to tell how help-
ful the people are in acquainting
visitors with their own country
and traditions, subjects on which
they are well informed “unlike
most of us in the United States.”

Carolyn was enrolled in the
Institute de Touraine in Tours,
a division of‘ the summer ses-
sions of the University of Poi-
tiers, for six weeks. She claims
she was not too successful in her
English to French translations of
Virginia Woolf, Henry James,
and Aldous Huxley.

In spite of having studied
French only half as long as most
of the other students, the awardee
enjoyed her courses especially
those on the contemporary French

novel. In this, she.states, that her
French literature course here at
Pitt was an invaluable aid.
Reduced Rates

.In addition to traveling about
France, Carolyn visited England,
Scotland, the Netherlands, Ger-
many, Switzerland, and Italy.
During a visit to the National Gal-
lery in London, she got a helpful
hint from an American girl who
told her that she could get into
museums all over Europe at re-
duced rate by showing her Pitt
1-D card.
i The helpfulness of the London

bus drivers amazed the student.

bus,” she exclaimde. “They just
let me off and showed me the
right one.”

When Carolyn arrived in Am-
sterdam, she was reunited with a
former school-mate from New
Kensington High. Mineke was an
exchange "student from Holland
during their senior year and now
attends the University of Amster-
dam, which is scattered through-
out the.city.

Bicycle Tour

Thus, Mineke gave her Ameri-
can friend a tour of the school
and the city on the back of a bi-
cycle. Carolyn felt quite at home
in the student’s apartment as they
ate a Dutch meal, to the music of
Harry Belafonte, “My Fair Lady,”
and “Most Happy Fellow.”

While in Switzerland the trav-
eler visited the present United
Nations headquarters (formerly
the League of Nations) in the
Pare Wilson in Geneva. She
chose the tour given in French
to test her skill in understand-
mg.

It was in Switzerland, though,
that language proved not to be a
barrier. On a train to Zermatt, a
Swiss couple, who spoke only Ger-
man and a few French words, be-
friended Carolyn. They would
point and say a word in German
to make her understand. Their
system worked so well that they
stayed with her for a couple days,
helping her ﬁnd her way around.

French Italians

Neither did Italy pose a prob-
lem for the non-Italian speaking
girl. She was lucky enough to be
with French speaking Italians
most of the time. “Otherwise, I
was able to understand enough
Italian, and they could understand

my F-renchso that we got along
beautifully,” she commented.
Although many of her experi-
ences were« uniquely her own,
Carolyn did behave like a typi-
cal traveler in some instances.

When in Rome, the American
student did as the Romans. She
covered the city via motor scooter.
Even with such quick transporta-
tion, however, she missed seeing
the Pope who had returned to
Rome for only one day from his
itvtritely”, and taught her much
of the city’s history. She sums up
their hospitality by saying, “They
treated me with the greatest kind-
ness. With their help, I’ve come
to love Paris and to know real
French people.”

All Women Invited

summer residence. She explains
this situation by stating “Well, I
didn’t know he was there. After
all, I couldn’t read the Italian
newspapers, and no one told me.”

Used Sign Language

Of Germany, she says that it.

was one of the cleanest and most
austere places she encountered.
This was the only place where not
knowing the language was a dis-
tinct handicap. “I was frustrated
because I couldn’t speak German
or read signs or menus. “To ﬁnd a
railroad station, I drew a cartoon!”
she wrote in her mid-summer re-
port.

Upon entering the famous
Cathedral of Cologne with its
Gothic architecture, she let her
thoughs wander to a more fa-
miliar Gothic scene, the Com-
mons Room here at the Univer-
sity. ,

Paris was to Carolyn as en-
chanting as she always imagined.
“It is a beautiful city with all its
parks and monuments. I really

__loved it” she declares. One of her

great thrills was meeting the
French girl to whom she has writ-
ten for six years. Monique and
her mother ascorted the student to

‘several landmarks, including the

Eiffel Tower. _
One complaint that Carolyn
had was the misrepresentation
of American life which people
-on the continent see through
American movies. She described
the ﬁlms she saw advertsied as
our lowest’ grade, even trashy.
She spent most of her Paris stay
with the Armands, relatives of
Suzanne Roche, Ed. ’57 and a close
friend of Carolyn’s. They made

her feel “like a princess, to phrase

BUTTON-DOWN WINSOCKI!

College students love shirts
with button-down collars, but
we’ve never known exactly
why. So Van Heusen’s research
department asked around and
got the following answers.

L.B. Senior at Mass. Insti-
tute of Entomology. “The but-
tons keep things from crawling
under your collar. Or, if things
do crawl under your collar,
the buttons prevent them from
crawling out again.”

D?.D.E. Freshman at Hora-
tio Alger Tech. “You get more
buttons so I ﬁgure the shirt is
more valuable. Is it?”

B_.P. Junior at the Pate
School of Tonsorial Arts.
“They’re cooler! Wisps of air
blow through the little hole
in the button and keep my
clavicle at a refreshing tem-
perature.

P.S. Senior of M akemonezfs
Correspondence School. “I’m a

- neurotic. With Button-down

shirts I can wear one side but-
toned and the other side un-
buttoned, thereby giving the
effect of wearing two types of
shirt at one time. Oh help me,
help me!”

Z.J. Graduate student at
the TS. Swinburne School of
Beautiful Experiences. “But-
tons remind me of pearls. Pearls
remind me of oysters. Oysters
remind me of indigestion. Indi-
gestion reminds me of my doc-
tor. My doctor reminds me of

‘(his nurse. She’s gorgeous. Gor-

geous! So the more buttons
the better.”

Yes, there’s agreement that
button-down collars are the
thing. And there’s further
agreement that Van Heusen
is the king of Button-down '
stylists. Just take a look at
Van Heusen Oxfordians next
time you’re in the market for
shirts. You'll see immediately
why they’re famous. $5.00.

quate information about the stu-
dents in his classes, and a work-
ing knowledge of the techniques
which have proved effective.

It is also important that college

'teachers have an insight into the

nature of higher education, a re-
cognition of the responsibilities
of colleges and universities in
modern society, and an under-
standing of the professional role
of the college teacher.

To further these goals, with
the School of~Education as a
coordinating agency, the Inter-
disciplinary Seminar is being
planned. Dr. George L. Fahey,
professor of psychology and
education, will act as coordina-
tor. L P

The seminar will meet weekly
and will be offered in two sec-
tions, there will be a course for
advanced graduate students plan-
ning to enter college teaching and

an in-service education seminar
for junior faculty members inter-
ested in participating.

Each seminar meeting will be
devoted to one broad topic to be
developed by a person or panel
from the University staff. Ini-
tially, the discussion topics will
be predetermined and a careful
schedule will be followed.

However, to achieve flexibility,
the program will allow opportu-
nity for additional subjects of in-
terest and importance, for con-
tinued discussion of vital pro-
blems, and for review and sum-
marization of material already
covered. ‘

Among the broad subjects to be
considered in the seminar are
“The Aims and Purposes of High-
er Education,” “The Profession of
College Teaching,” “1nstitutional
Organization and the. Teacher,"
“The General Nature of Learn-
ing,” and “Motivation and Its Im-
portance to Learning.”

A ‘program was announced at the University today

with the aim of beneﬁting al1_.§f§tudents‘«whether they are

engineers or English majors.’  ,P’oetry. Reading series

 

sponsored originally by the I-lun1’aiiitie's,_VSociety, has out-'
lined a program of readings and discussion designed to
“make available to the student body a living contact? with ,-
the world’s great literature.”__ A A P

The important. word in this statement of purposeiis
the word “living.” For in this program the great works of
the world will be presented by those members of the
faculty who are most familiar with" the works. They will
include bilingual presentations which will allow the listener

. to hear the poems as they were written. There will be topics

of discussion which will be presented by those who are
presently working in ﬁeldsrelated to these timeless topics.

This group will present not a technical study of poetry
or a survey of speciﬁc periods. This program is aimed at a
far more important appreciation of the literature to be
read. It is aimed at an inspiration of the student and an
awakening of the  of lessons in living that can be ob-
tained from Athe:;::%‘iwritings of ﬁne minds. It will show the
delicate delinliations of thought and their repition in varying
shades of..-opinion and culture which are found in world
poetry. A‘ H A ‘

There is more to be learned’ at this University than
how togbuild a better equation. But it is necessary to point
the way. This is the job undertaken by Miss Ruth Haun
and Dr. Jack Kolbert, co—chairmen of the group. This is
the third year for these two capable people as directors
of the series. It has pare-dated the current rush of cultural
meetings by two years and therefore has a program which
has proven its popularity time and time again. The program
announced on page one today shows promise that the best

Eliminate Censorship .. . ..

College Press  

_ By Gordon Clowney -.

A college newspaper exists for two main reasons.
Its first purpose is to keep the student body in-
formed, and the second, to provide an outlet for.
the creativity and opinions of those, students, who,
wishing to extend their educa-
tion beyond the classroom, see
fit to spend their time and ener-
gies working on such a publi-
cation. '

Even though the actual writ-
ing, layout, and in some cases
even the printing is done by the
students, there remains the ques-
tion as to who should have the
ﬁnal say about what material
should or should not be included
In other words,
should at college papergbe censored, and, if so, by
whom and to what degree? This is a-perpetual
question on college campuses , throughout . the A
country each year.

There exists two schools of thought on this prob-

 

lem. Some educators believe that if the paper is

entirely or partly supported by an allocation of’
student funds, members of the administration,
through such channels as a publication board, or
student faculty advisor, have the right to guide
student policy on controversial issues. This. line of
reasoning points out that if a college or university
is performing the dutiesof publisher meaning ‘to
supply the paper with necessary funds, then it also
has the corresponding right to dictate editorial
policy. , ‘h , .

Mr. Robert U. Brown, President and Editor of

. “Editor and Publisher,” and an outstanding pro-

ponent of censorship, "in cases where the paper is
connected with "the university, says in‘ a recent
article appearing in  magazine, that “the Con-
stitutional guarantee  a free press gives us all
the ‘right to’ use a printing press to express our
views. We either can buy one or hire‘ one to have

our say. But it doesn’t -give us the right to use

Give Editors Authority ,

While technically Mr. Brown is correct in stat-
ing that publishers have the right to dictate edi-
torial policy, student editors, if properly selected,
should have the right to dictate the editorial policy
of their respective publication.

After all, when you come right down to it, the
job of the student paper, just as the job of the
city paper, is to (1) present the news as it hap-
pened, and (2) to comment on said news, both. by.

    
  
   
  
  
  
   

and by editorials, representing the combined agg-
tudes and opinions of the editorial staﬁ. WW
So why all the fuss about censorship, if the facts
‘are straight, and the criticisms or evaluations well
thought out, columns and editorials can do more
than provide food for thought. Combined with news
stories, and the experience and judgment of the ’
indiviidual reader, they merely offer the opinion of »
an individual, or group of individuals which can be ,
either accepted or rejected, according to the readers 6

In Scoring,

touchdowns in the ﬁrst and adding a pair in the second.

Fullback Fred Riddle continued
to eat up large chunks of yardage
and chinpped in with a touch-
down on a two-yard dive. The

Dick Carr knifed through the

The deck was apparently
stacked against the visitors from

to play because of injuries or

College Football Players Today

By JANICE KLEIN
“Contrary to public opinion, football players do not get some-
thing for nothing here at Pitt,” says Jim Theodore, this week’s sports-
man on parade. “Unfortunately the members of the squad do not
drive big cars, live in luxury apartments with maid service or get

a hundred dollars a month spending money.
“A lot of people think all we do is have a good time. Don’t kid
yourself, it isn’t so. Every man on the team spends about four or ﬁve

hours working out and at skullﬁ
practice, and a lot of them have
outside jobs too. The guys work
hard for the kind of a team that
we and the rest of the school can
be proud of. ,

“I personally feel this year’s
Panthers will be as good if not
better than the great Pitt teams
of the past. What we’d like most,
next to a winning team, is the
school’s backing when we record
a loss as well as a win,” com-
mented Jim. '

Jim is a living example of the
fact that football players are
more than all brawn and no
brains, for he is a versatile and
capable person. The scholarly Mr.

has dabbled in
most school ac-
tivities found
Men’s Council
one of the most worthwhile or-
ganizations. Phi Eta Sigma, Alpha
Epsilon Delta, and Junior Worthy
are a few of the honoraries to
which the modest Jim belongs.

This busy schedule is nothing
new for him. At Wilmerding High
Jim’s old alma .mater he played
outstanding football, was active
in school affairs, worked part
time, and graduated with high
honor.

He is not the only one in the
Theodore family who has disting-
guiSh€-,d.~ himself as. an athlete. . His

  

THEODORE

brother Mike played basketball
at Carnegie Tech, and he is now
freshman-P basketball coach for
that school.

Jim, who is better known to his
friends as “Ramar,” can think of
nothing he’d rather do than eat
and listen ‘to music. In both cases
he is not too particular.

He loves all kinds of food, and
everything from Elvis to Bach
satiﬁes his musical hunger. Any-
one who was fortunate enough to
see the Sigma Chi spring carnival
show knows Jim doesn’t make
such bad music himself. As a mat-
ter of fact he looked almost pro-
fessional.

So far much hasn’t been said
about Jim’s work on the football
ﬁeld. That record stands for it-
self. In true Theodore style it is
one to be proud of. His great stop
of Jim Shanl.ey in the Oregon
game is an example of his foot-
ball prowess. On or off the play-
ing field James Theodore is a
name Pitt can be proud to lay
claim to.

Nothing Proven
In Nebraska Tilt

By ED KOLTISKA
Sports Editor

 Nothing much can really be said about Saturday’s Pitt-Nebraska
contest at the Stadium. The Panthers proved themselves to be the
superior team on the ﬁeld by trouncing the Cornhuskers 34-0. One
of the highest scores the Jungle’Cats have rolled- up since the 1953
season when they defeated North Carolina State 40-0. But then too,
it wasn’t much of a victory for John Michelosen and his gridders.
Coach Bill Jennings, who is in his first year at the helm of Ne-
braska, has had a hard time all season trying to ﬁeld a decent team.
Because of injuries, flu, and lack of depth, Jennings has had to use
some of the players in three or four positions in the same game.
A lot of credit has to be given to the Nebraska squad. Although
they didn’t play well and were quite disorganized at times, they
were persistent and played hard throughout the game. A few times
the Huskers did look good as they forced the Jungle Ca-ts to punt
on three different occasions. “
This is one game that Coach‘Michelosen had his reserves in be-
fore the first quarter was over to pick up some more experience.

.Whether or not they received valuable experience will be proven in

next week’s tilt with Army. There is a tendency for a team to pro-
vide the same kind of competition that it receives. Nebraska played
sloppy ball and perhaps that will be the type of experience the re-
serves picked up. * ,
Of course no coach likes to play that type of game but nothing
can be done to prevent it. A lot of practice will be necessary to make
sure the Panthers will be in good coordination for the Cadet tilt.
With Army losing a tough one to Notre Dame, next week’s game
should prove a big one, with powerful lines determining the winner.

Tutoring On Coast
Brings High Praise

Seven University professors,
who had served as tutors for the
Panther football squad during the
team’s recent ten day trip to the
West Coast, stated that the Blue
and Gold gridders were students
and gentlemen as well as ath-
letes.

The seven men, representing
were: Dr. John Knipp, mathe-
matics; Dr. Paul Kohberger, As-
sistant Dean of the School of
McDaniel, chemistry; Dr. James
Olah, biological sciences; Assistant
Professor Vincent Lopardo, mech-
anical engineering, and Mr. Ro-
bert Laing, English. _

It was pointed out that, al-
though the professors had no
power to compel the ball players
to attend the two and a half hour
study sessions, there was nearly
100 percent attendance at every
meeting. i

In regard to the Jungle Cats’

mentioned that several of the
players, at their own request,
passed up a two hour long tour
of a lumber plant in Eugene,
Oregon so that they could receive
added assistance in mathematics.
physics, and various engineering
ﬁelds. -
Remarking on the tutoring sys-
tem, .the professors stated that
they believed it was effective be-
cause the ratio of thirty-seven
players to seven professors per-

more extensive studying than
classroom exercises would have
allowed. I

Dr. Knipp, the captain-elect of
the squad of tutors, added that
the players aided the program by
bringing math assignment sheets
along on the trip, and by inquir-
ing of other assignments prior to
their departure on September
25.

“This,” said Dr. Kohnberger,
“gave the boys a chance to use

effectively.”

Concerning the conduct of the
gridders, all the professors com-
mented that observers on the
Coast were continually impressed
by the courtesy and respect paid
to total strangers by the boys in
the blue Pitt blazers.

FRESHMAN BASKETBALL , .

Tennis Courts

Opened Sunda

The Pitt Wildwood Club will
be the scene Sunday, October 13
of two important openings. The
newly constructed set of six ten-
nis courts will be dedicated in
official ceremonies at 2:00 p.m.
Sunday morning will also mark
the opening of a week-long golf
event which is open to all mem-
bers of the University family.

The long-awaited ribbon cut-
ting for the Pitt courts will be
featured by the appearance and
performance of the Pitt varsity
tennis team. In addition, amateur
stars of the Western Pennsylvania
tennis set, male and female, will
be on hand to give the new facili-
ties a baptismal of ﬁre.

The second annual University
golf championships will begin un-
der Calloway Handicap rules. The
thirty-six hole event will be play-
ed in three divisions-students,
faculty, and members. Prizes will
be awarded in each category on
the basis of low. medal score.

A pre-determined number of
holes will be discounted from
each competitor’s score to pro-
vide a fair handicap. In addition
baseball and touch football games
will be organized for interested
non-golfers and tennis players.
Locker room facilities will be
available for every participant. '

The research being done by Dr. Yusuf A. Yoler is
signiﬁcant not only.to himself, but to General Electric
and the security of the nation as well. At present, the
company is participating as a prime contractor on
three of the four long-range ballistic. missiles pro-

“The thing that has impressed me most in my two

young people here. My ﬁeld is guided—missile research

the scope of the company’s research and development
program, I’ve had the opportunity to work with tech-
