Bernice Kimel Says
Sales Yield $2000

Bernice Kimel, chairman of the
Student Government Book Ex-
change, announced that the ﬁnal
distribution of money and books
will be Friday ‘from noon to 2

. p.m. and Monday from 5 to 7 p.m.

in 325 SU.

Any books not picked up at
that time will become SG prop-
erty to be sold at a future book
‘exchange’, '

“Only oneacarton of books out
of seven large ones is left,” Miss
Kimel reported. “In ‘comparison
to the over-all ﬁgure, that’s a
pretty good percentage.

Best Exchange ’

“Students have told me that
this was the best exchange Pitt
has ever had. This could be due
to a few reasons. First, it was
held at the beginning of the year
so that students could get the
books for their classes. Secondly,
the upperclassmen were pleased
that we had books for such divi_s-
ions as Business and Engineering.
“Thirdly, the collection last tri-
mester gave us a quantity to start
with. This almost doubled with
the September collection.

“If it hadn’t been for the stu-
dents’ co-operation in getting
books in in quality as ‘well as

    

 

quantity it would never have been
the‘.same.’»’-   ' ' V

THE TRICK DRILL unit of Pershing Riﬂes,
Company K-5.has been judged ﬁr-st in the Nation.

By BERNIE TRUMPOWER

Last fall at the Pitt-Navy game a cheering crowd watch- .

ed in awe as a drill unit performed various feats of precision
and maneuverability. The group performing was the Trick
Drill Team ofACompany K-5, Pershing Riﬂes. The danger
involved in such" an attempt was veriﬁed by the bloody
uniform worn by one cadet who was «pierced in- the back by

A
T

one of the 18 'inch bayonets. I

The maneuver is known as the
“Pitt Flip”_ exchange and is at-
tempted by no other team in the
nation. Once again this year at the
UCLA game the Trick Drill Team
will appear ‘to repeat such breath
taking drills. "

The Trick Drill Team is, only
one phase of the campus group,
a unit of the national honorary
military society. A unique organ-
ization, PR enjoys a position’ of
prominence in military circles,
the social life of fraternal-like
organizations, and reverses a his-
tory which dates back to .1892.

Pershing Organized .,

It wasin "that" year that the
famous John Pershing, then only
a lieutenant, organized a drill
organization at the University of
Nebraska to serve as an example
of precision to the drill unit on
campus there.

Here at the University, the
Company K-5 was initiated un-
der Lt. Colonel Paul B. Wolﬁ,

who just recently left the Uni- -

versity for Germany. At that
time there were but 29 active
members on campus. Their
record of growth and _achieve-
ment is admirable.

Since its birth here-, Company
K-5 has ﬁlled to the hilt the tro-
phy case in its olﬁce. Many of
the trophies have‘ been contri-
buted by the Trick Drill Team.
Performing admirably in national
competition, the sixteen members
of the.team and their comman-
der have taken top honors as the

National Pershing Riﬂes number
one trick drill team.

Units Gathered

Gathering for this competition},-

in Washington, D.C. were units
from California to *Maine. Back-
ing the top honors of their Trick
Drill Team, the members of
Company K-5 ﬂashed through to
take ﬁfth place in over-all com-
.petition in the United States.
The University unit is but
one of‘ many ‘scattered across
the country. From the company
of forty members originated by
Pershing himself, P-R has ex-
panded into the majority of col-
leges and universities having
ROTC programs.

Still today, and especially true-

at the University, PR serves
as a standard of precision drill
before the cadets. Now, after wars

’threat_ened to abolish without al-

lowance for regrowth the honor-
ary military organization, there
are approximately 200 Pershing
Riﬂes Companies across. the na-
tion.
Wars Threatened ~
The Spanish American War,
the First and ‘Second World Wars,
and the Korean conﬂict provided
opportL1nities for the PR boys to
display valor and courage. The
threat of disbandment due to the
wars was merely a phase in the
development of the organization.
P-R has a tradition which it
must uphold. Encouraging every
member to participat_ion in one

drill team or the riﬂe squad is

“Hell Week,” the time when
the pledge may end up bedding

Such experiences are later in-

Survey Links
College Life
To Headaches

Students sulfer more headaches
than any other comparable age
group according to a survey taken
by a leading pharmaceutical com-
pany.

Headaches linked to higher edu-
cation appear to fall into four
major categories: ﬁnances, friends,
ﬁnals, and the future, the report
states.

The cost of education has zoom-

ed in the past few years, making
the ﬁnancing of a college career a
serious problem. Making friends
and being popular seems to. be the
second big worry.
Final exams seem to be
readymade headache instigators,
since they cause frequent anx-

iety and lack of sleep. When all '

of these are topped by a block-

buster headache —— what does

the future hold? More problems.

Pdrtner.sIiip in Peril

' The announcement that campus radio’ station WPGH
 is‘ joining with similar organizations at Carnegie Institute
of Technology and Mount Mercy“ College for the forma-
_ ‘liion of the area’s ﬁrst collegiate radio network is only the
id. latest" in a series of impressive accomplishments by the
_ ﬂedgling University broadcasters.

 In less than one year of continuing operation, WPGH
has built up its record library, acquired a coaxial cable,
obtained a United Press International teletype, introduced
regularly scheduled world and campus programs, as well
asdiscussion programs on all facets of University life, sup-
’ plied taped coverage of major events at school, increased
1‘ its power and generally increased the number of its listen-
ers. '

, Surprisingly enough, virtually all of these advance-
frnents have occurred without any real assistance from the
University higher-ups.
_ In the middle of April, WPGH requested $15,000 for
A expanding facilities. Its advisory board approved the re-
fquests, with some stipulations, but when the plea reached
those who held the money, it was turned down. As a result,
the broadcasters, have had to limp along on occasional
hand-outs from various on-and ofl‘-campus organizations.
H lAfter several months of careful work with the advising
lcommittee, the'station’s general manager, Dan Johnson,
finally announced that a_ minimum of $2,800 was needed
-‘in order to uphold present broadcasting standards. Much of
these‘ funds are needed merely to replace vital pieces of
equipment which, having been substandard to begin with,
and now wearing out.
. At this writing, Johnson reports that he has yet to re-
,ceive any official word on the acceptance or rejection of his
‘bid for the basic $2,800. . A
‘He adds to this that “Putting it mildly, we’re not very
' Optimistic.” \ H

What's in

a Name?

By Barry Gross

It is rumored that men’s Council has more or
less notiﬁed Student Government that they don’t
intend to sponsor the Christmas Ball this year be-
cause they’ve lost money on it the last few times.
If this is true, then this is an ’
especially good time to make a A '
suggestion about the Christmas
Ball to whomever the next spon-
sor will be.

Don’t call it the Christmas
Ball.

can it the Ice Ball, the Win-
ter Frolic, or even the Frozen
Orgy, but not the Christmas Ball.

This suggestion is not
prompted by the selﬁsh feelings.
of; a member of a religious mi-2 ,
nority, but by a realistic appraisal of the compo-
sition of the University community. ‘_

There are many non-Christians connected with

 

the University: Jews, Moslems, Hindus, and others. .

Among them are many who have been and would
be consciously or unconsciously repelled, because
of their upbringings, by a dance connected with
Christmas or- any other religious holiday which 'is
contrary to their beliefs.

A feeling of unleasiness and of resentment hits._

even the most liberal and “integrated” non-Chris-
tians because of the way Christianity’s — especially
Protestantism’s —- religious observances have often
been mixed with those secular traditions which all
Americans observe. I

A "Chrisfmus_ Carols?

, Those Christian readers who cannot understand
what this feeling of uneasiness is like, might better
understand it if, for example, they talked to. a Jew

who had, to sing Christmas carols in grade school. *

“Silent Night” is a beautiful song, but thewords
“Christ the Saviour is borne” are hard to sing, if
one does not believe Christ to“be the saviour.'It is
also hard to attend a dance named for a holiday
one does not celebrate. I

Readers who were appalled by the recent Su-
preme Court decision concerning a nonsectarian

_prayer (if that’s possible) in New York public

schools may View this suggestion oflchanging the
name of a dance as further ‘evidence of some type

of campaign designed to thrust religion out of
education.

This is not so. The suggestion, as well as the
Supreme Court decision, is well in keeping’ with
the “two sword” concept which Christianity itself
has advanced: “Render unto Caesar those things
that are Caesar’s, and unto God, those things that
are God’s.’’ ,

Is the dance which is traditionally held at the

>University during December supposed to be in

honor of Christmas, or winter vacation‘? This is
a question which the next sponsors of the dance

  
 
  
 
   
  
 
  
 
  
 
  

must answer» before they print the tickets and

announcements. _
Pseudo-tradition '
Since the only records or students’ religions in
the University are the IBM cards which are utilized
only by the~University chaplains for mailing pur-
poses, ﬁgures are not available ‘that show the ‘per-

centage of non-Christians. Without assuming that  _. ‘

changingithe name ‘of the dance would cause all ’»

of those who stayed away to inow come, it is safe
to. say that the change would increase attendance.
Few in, the University community feel it neces-

‘sary to impose, partoftheir religious beliefs upon

others, just because theirireligion is in the major-
ity. Most would not think of it. Yet, they have
allowed the formation of pseudo-traditions from

the rest of the ‘country. Minor when ta’ken‘sepa'-

rately, these traditions are allowed to ﬂourish on ;

the incorrect and naive assumption that non-
Christians do_not mind the clamor of Church bells;
the incessant repetition of Christmas‘ carols over
radio and TV; the fact’ that‘a worthwhile campaign
against disease is conducted through Christmas,
Seals, although everyone is asked to contribute;
and the innumerable festivities, where all are wel-

' come‘, labeled. with the preﬁx of Christmas.

Although fully aware that the majority of the
people in the University, as well as the‘ United .
States, are Christian, and while fully understand-

-ing how hypersensitive’ individuals might fear that_ . '
"‘the minorities are taking over,” I still believe that

the University, as a secular institution, should not
arrange celebrations for all its members that are.
named for any religious holidays.

Budapest-Part Two . . .

    Cityoi th

e Sade

By Joanne Bacher

The blue sky was the‘ same here in Hungary as
in Austria, but -/the land looked poorer. There was
very» little corn, for instance, and what was_visible'
from the bus drooped and was weather-beaten and
unhealthy. ‘There was no ma- ‘
chinery in sight, and’I frequent- , '
ly saw oxen pulling carts" of hay,
and men plowing the land by
hand. ‘ I _.
It was almost~as if I were
going back in time; living in the
past. Where were the" fresh
green rolling hills? They seemed
to have been stopped by the
fences at.the border. The towns-
were crude and poor. I couldﬁ’t
tell if they were weather-beaten
or war-beaten, but they were beaten.

The people all ‘seemed togwalk with a burden‘
on their backs. Even the children looked serious.-
They would waveto us and ‘then smile if we would
wave back. We soonwaved to everyone. It was
a pitiful sight, but,_soul-rewarding, to see the older

 

people's faces light up with amazement and joy .

when they realized our bus was from Vienna, the
“Free World,” and that we cared enought to want
to be friendly. ' ; '

We arrived at the Palace Hotel in Budapest at
one o’clock on Saturday afternoon, checked into
our rooms, and had lunch. After lunch we decided
to go visiting.

By the time we had walked one block on
Kertesz Street, I felt I ‘had just paraded in my
bathing suit before the crowd and judges at a Miss
America Pageant. ‘
Buildings and Bullets _

Although we managed to ignore‘ the ever-pres-
ent stares, we couldh’t ignore the buildings on that
street. Every one had visible battle ‘scars. Some
were just nicks from shell fragments, others were
bullet holes. Just before reaching the apartment
house we wanted, I saw something that almost
sickened. me. ~ .

There was a wall of cement, a doorway which ,

was closed by a grey metal cover -resembling the
top of a roll—top' desk,_ rnore cement wall, and

  

' . ‘Except for a_ bit

were clear, distinct bullet holes.’ They were stopped
by ,nothing. ‘ They went straight across —- ‘ate
abdomen level. I i ,'

' It was seeing these “reminders” that brought~to
mind the newspaper stories and pictures I had seen
of the ’56 revolt, and how many innocent people,
were mercilessly‘ shot down in the streets --
these streets. I ' -

On the way back to our hotel, we encountered‘
a man who spoke to us in English‘ (and was a. little
taken aback when we‘ answered in German). A14.
though he knew a little German too, he said ‘he
understood ‘English better. That surprised me and
I became slightly suspicious. (It’s ‘easy to do in’.

To me, Budapest appeared a very sad city. It
was easy to see that at one time she was quite a
spectacular one. But between the big red stars on
top of all important buildings and the war scars on

' everything, it was now pitiful.

My companion \and I labelled the man “the

.Believer.” We hadboth been impressed by how
little one saw anyonesmile. Not that we ‘go down -'

the street grinning all the, time, but we do smile

occasionally. We didn’t see more than two people ‘

smiling in the two days we were there. (And one
of those two was a girl on the -arm of a Russian.

Sunday we_toured the city in various buses ...

know who to trust, I was forced to leave the pack-

foolish risk to take, but I hid the package as best

DR. DOUGLASS THOMPSON, ‘director of the student health serv-
' ice, indicates a poster showing his attitude toward smoking. The
health service has begun ‘ a campaign to discourage smoking on
campus, including presentation of statistics concerning its dangers.

Health Director Seeks

:"T o Dissuade Smokers

A _,_may shorten their lives; others

_. By JOSEY

GROSSMAN

Dr. Douglass S. Thompson, director of the Student
Health Service, has begun long rang efforts to disuade non-

smokers from smoking.

“I am quite ﬁrmly convinced that some persons that
smoke and inhale for a fairly long time will develop diseases
they otherwise would not have gotten. Some of the illnesses

;."may be of more inconvenience

than consequence.

“Of the —70 ‘per’ cent of the-

freshmen who don’t smoke now,

many will by their senior year. _

Anything the University could

contribute to stopping these. fresh— -

men‘ non-‘smokers from starting
would be~helpfu1 and important.
Smoking Encouraged ‘

‘K “And yet almost everything you
see on campus encourages smok-
ing rather than discouraging it:
cigarette machines, enticing ads
in ,_ football . programs .and cer-
tainly in The Pitt News, the ap-
parent social attributes of smok-
ing, the faculty smoking during
classes, and so on.

“There is a great’ current in
the country moving in this di-
rection. 'Since June the Uni-

‘ versity has forbidden the dis-

-\,tribution of sample cigarettes

 their thoughts on the matter.”'

‘on any of its properties and has
agreed not to lend its facilities
~ to contests.

“But most universities don’t
take a stand on smoking. Thus
freshmen come to school and
never feel any qestion of whether
cigarettesare good or bad.‘ If the
University would take a position
to produce a hurdle, while tak-
ing the jump they may collect

Director Suggests

Thompson suggested two ‘ac-
tions the University could take.
“First it ‘could disassociate itself
from economic gain.» But right
__now this is{ a signiﬁcant part of
their advertising budget; Second-
ly, along with the nation, they
could present the facts to the
people and“ hope that- the facts
will eventually bring victory. In
" eneral its ways are the ways of

r

 the world.”

An_ address during orienta-

tion was the first of the Health
Service's efforts to present the
dangrs of smoking, including
statistics on lung cancer, to the
students. They will also fea-
ture articles on this subject on
the bulletin board in the Health
Service. Finally, when any of
the doctorssee a clinical rea-
son for stopping a patient’s
smoking, “they will do so rather
than bypass the issue.” .
. Thompson’s investigation, like
so much other current work, was
stimulated by an AP dispatch
from the Royal College of Phys-
icians of England on March 7,
1962: “It’s the cigarette smokers
who get cancer ofthe lung. In-
deed, those who smoke 25 or 30
cigarettes a -day have about 30
times the chance dying of it than
a nonsmoker has.” .-

Student Commented
In interviews for student opin-
ion, Gail Preininger, sophomore
in Liberal Arts ,  commented,
“There are so many articles about
the -dangers of smoking that you

can’t help but know the threat.‘

But people smoke anyway. .Prac-
tically all doctors smoke and they
certainly know the dangers of
smoking.”

Freshman Janice Doll agreed:
,f‘People read ‘about cancer so
often that more facts ,wouldn’t
scare them in the least. Fresh-
men won’t listen anyhow.”

“The only way to discourage
non-smokers from smoking is to
get rid of advertising and the idea
of smoking as -a romantic and
idealistic “thing,” concluded Joel
Filner, senior . in Liberal ‘Arts.
“This would be very difﬁcult be-
cause there is so much money
involved, and yet it is the -impact
of advertising that causes most
people to start.”

‘Review of ‘Tl1e'Pat Hobby Stories’

F itzgerald’s Closing 
Efforts Rewarding

By MATTHEW NESVISKY ‘

F. Scott Fitzgerald spent the last year or two of his life
as a hack Hollywood screenwriter in order to pay off his
enormous debts. On weekends, however, he busied himself
with short stories, for the dual purpose of buying a Vassarian
education for his daughter and proving that he was still a

/‘

literary artist.

The bulk of these short pieces,
which appeared in 17 consecutive
issues of Esquire, have recently
been collected in book form and
published under the apt title, The
Pat Hobby Stories (Charles Scrib-
ner’s Sons; I66 pp; $3.50).

Like the declining Fitzgerald,
Pat Hobby is an aging movie
scripter who lives on gin for
breakfast and unending hopes for
the next paycheck, the next con-
tract, or the next screen credit.
Unlike Fitzgerald, the ﬁctional
writer is proud of a long associ-
ation with Hollywood, during
which time he has never devel-
oped any real creativity.

Hollywood. in the thirties
hummed with an activity that
belied the economic despair of
the rest of the United States.
Perhaps movie people were so
busy being phoney they‘ did not
have time to_ notice the De-
pression.

At any rate, Fitzgerald man-
aged to satirize members of every
occupation in America’s . shoddy
cinema society: the money—hun-
gry producer, the pseudo-intel-
lectual director, the Rolls—Royce-
enclosed star, the sofa-doomed
secretary, the slavineg script-girl,
the starry-eyed hopeful from

the -hotshot writer.

"The Waltzing Pat
' Waltzing 4
Pat’ Hobby, whom Fitzgerald
constantly reminds us as being .49
years old and whose only perma-
nent possession seems to be a
pair of red-rimmed eyes.

Failure plagues Hobby as it
did_his creator. In “The Homes
of the Stars,” a desperate Pat tries
to garner enough slices of bread
to make an overdue payment-on
his car by guiding some tourists
throuxgh celebrities’ mansions. He
does ﬁne until he takes the gawk-
ers to what they believe is Shir-
ley Temple’s romper room. And
in walks the master of the house
unexpectedly. The head’ of Pat’s
studio.’ But Pfat is already. dash-_
ing through the back yard.

Acquires Semi-Success ’

But Hobby is not always a
loser; indeed, he acquires a spiri-

Everytown, Idaho, and, of course, -

among them all. is .

tual. semi-success in “A Patriotic
Short” when, temporaritly dis-
gusted with the tripe of people
who'have ruined him, he pencils
into his hard-won script for all
Hollywood to hear and obey: “Go.
straight to hell.” '
And maybe that‘s where they‘
all are all the time. For Fitz-
gerald hated doing script work
so much that he drove ' him-
self to write these stores; often
two a. week with extensive re-
visions. _

As a result, some of Pat Hob-
by’s antics are written in slapdash
fashion, while others remain as
priceless literary vignettes. All of
the stories, however, reveal the
feverish hand of one of the coun-
try’s greatest writers in his last-
minute attempt to prove that he
was not a-Pat I-lobby.

It Goes *On..."

_ ~ 11

BAR N0 HOLDS

Big Jim Zanos, former star end of the 1959 Panther
football team, is throwing a victory celebration Saturday
after the Baylor game —— win or lose. I

V The site of the shindig will be the refurbished cocktail
lounge at 4519 Center Avenue, the Den of the Golden
Panther, formerly known as the Pitt Pott.

Zanos says the new look is wall-to-wall college students
,and has had a cave motif to go with the
 new name and some of the more riotous
-students. And Zanos, swathed in a white
apron,-will be slithering between the tables,
stiff—arming anyone out pf line. I

* =1:

Zanos isn’t the only former athlete stir-
ring up trouble in these parts. Joe Solomon,
NCAA 167-pound wrestling champion . in
1954, is sporting a blazing recl jacket behind
the bar of the Peppermint Lounge West on

Jim Zanos Brownsville Road -in Brentwood. _ .

Solomon was the fella who constantly disputed with his
coach, Rex Perry, during his school day’s about the length

 

S of his black locks. Perry‘made Solomon get rid of a duck-

tail haircut and a goatee.
Samson or Solomon . _ . .

When queried about Perry’s coaching ability, Solomon
was very frank: I _ 

“I still don’t care much for him,” Solomon said. “We
just never got along. Let’s face it. he’s no diplomat. But
if you want to be an NCAA champion and he can’t make
you one, nobody can. _

“I learned more from him in seven months than I learn-
ed in all my life. He was harder on us than he is onthose
guys today. I’ve heard that he’s mellowed a bit. - _

“I really felt sorry for his kid, Hugh, when he lost his
only match in college. Boy, Rex was all over him after that
one.‘I can’t cry about l'lln‘l*lTh2ugl’l. He made me a champ."

Coaches Leo Bemis and Carl Rees both got off on the
right foot in the soccer and cross-country sports, respectively.
Bemis looked especially smart when the two boys whom he
brought here on scholarship-aid last year each scored a goal

’ in the 2-0 win over Frostburg.

Coming Fast

It was the first time Bemis secured any type of aid and
he certainly made the most of it. Rees, on the other hand,
has noted that his first three men’s times rank in the best

, ten ever recorded on the 4.2 mile Flagstaf‘f"'course.

Larry Robinson’s triumph "was his ﬁrst winning
effort in the sport in his lifetime. “I knew he was im- 0
proved,” Rcesgsaid, “but I didn’t think Larry would
come along that fast. _

“Steve Waslo doesn’t« like finishing last like he did
against Slippery {Rock and if he comes back, we could be

Against Baylo

iBotl1 Teams. Seek
To Rebound After '

Opening Losses
By BOB SMIZIK

Double disillusionment will
glower under the harsh lights
of Waco, Texas Saturday
night when the Panthers and
Baylor Bears tangle once
again. .

The damp handkerchiefs from
the Miami loss have already been
laundered. And Houston’s sur-
prising 19-0 upsetlof Baylor Sat-
urday has deflated the Bear’s out-
look, too.

Still the Panthers have been in-
stalled as a point-and-a-h f fav-
orite, even though the Bears won
last year’s encounter, 16-13, at
the Stadium.

Bears Better

Baylor, illogically, actually out-
played I-louston, if that is possible
in a 19-0 loss. They controlled the
ball and were inside-Houston’s 30-
yard line five times.

Houston mustered only three

sustained drives, but all of them
resulted in scores. A defensive
back for Houston intercepted
ﬁve Baylor passes. This, un-
deniably, had a. weighted influ-
ence on the outcome. _,
‘ Panther coach Carl DePasqua
scouted the Baylor team and calls
them “a ﬁne, well-drilled football
team that ran into an opponent
that was sky-high.

“They made a lot of mistakes
which are normal for the ﬁrst.
game,” he said, “but it cost them
dearly.” Despite their loss, De-
Pasqua insists that Baylor “will
give us a ﬁne game and are better
than last Saturday’s score indi-
cated.’ V

The Panther’s still remain for-
tunate in escaping injuries. Chuck
Ahlborn has recovered from a
leg injuryand is ready to step in
for the suspended Paul Cercel.
Ralph Conrad and Ed Clark miss-
ed practice early in the week due
to minor ailments, but are expect,-
ed backin the lineup Saturday.

Soccermen Entertain
Ohio Bobcats Saturday

Ohio University provides the opposition and Kennard

‘Field the site for the second varsity soccer tilt of the season

Saturday at 10 a.m. The Panthers carry a 1-0 record into the

game against a team rated as a “potentially strong club.”
The prediction in Coach Leo Bemis’s “Soccer Outlook”

Second Win
In Ohio Meet

“Back to work” is the
theme of the cross-country
team, as expressed by Coach
Carl Rees, as the team _pre-
pares for a triangular meet Satur-
day with Kent State and Ohio
University. - . _

0 The run over the 4.2 mile Flag-
staff Hill course will begin at 11
a.m.

Althr ugh pleased by last"week’s
upset victory over Slippery Rock,
22-33, Coach Rees said the team
needs more work.

He is particularly concerned
about Steve Waslo, last year’s
most valuable performer, who
ﬁnished last on Saturday.

Limping Less

Runners Bill Mocnik and Dick
Cook are shaking off the ‘effects
of knee injuries, according to
Rees, and he expects improvement
here. Mocnik ﬁnished a game
eighth against the Rockets. ,_

Rees is expecting a tough

match. In a similar meet at

Kent State last year, Ohio Uni- "

versity defeated the Panthers.
32-24, and Kent State was dead
last with 87 points. ’

Ray Fleming and Bill Heller,
who ﬁnished ﬁrst and third, re-

spectively, return to bolster the

Ohio quint.

But Rees feels his own __team
has improved enough to meet the
challenge. He was delighted with
Larry Robinson’s‘ winning form
and the good showing of Sopho-
mores Ralph Basinsk-i and John
Bailey. ' . ’

strong bids for many of the
starting positions” has come true.

Five of the seven named in the .

pamphlet started in the Frostburg
game, and two of those chipped
in with goals.

At center forward, the Panthers
are at ;least three deep. Corky.
Cuthbert played some at Frost-
burg and reports that his “leg
felt pretty good.” He came close
to scoring ’a few times in the
game.

Bruising Booter

Aaron Luwisch, who started the

game at center forward, is “hang-

ing in there quite a bit,” accord-

ing to Bemis. Ted Verlato, .who

stands six-foot—one and weighs a

bruising 190 pounds, “is starting
to move,” the coach added, “and
can be tough.”

Bemis feels he has found a
due which is developing into a
’ good team in halfbacks Paul
Liberati and Bill Kovaes. The
coach I also commended Bob
“Murphy, the sixth of the seven
sophomores, on his play at half-
back when Kovacs cramped his
leg, and Chuck Dunbar, on his
showing at . fullback in the
Frostburg contest.

Liberati and. Dick Venglik, a
left fullback, have been elected
co-captains for this season’s squad.
Bemis refers to Liberati as “prob-
ably the most versatile and ex-

.perienced player on the team.”
‘Venglik, who hiked up the hill to

a \ physical education class of
Bemis’ two years ago, is, accord-_
ing to the coach, “a hustler on
the ﬁeld and a good, strong stu-
dent in his classes.’’

Liberati, atperfectionist who ap-
pears to be soccer’s version of
“Pepper Martin,” is the sparkplug
behind team spirit. “Although we
have a rough schedule,” the co-
captain added, “with hard work
and a few breaks we should do
well.”

Cubs Get First
Test Against ,

W. Va. Frosh

The Panther frosh‘ football team
will face the Little, Mountaineers
of _ West Virginia Saturday in
Morgantown, and Coach Bill Kali-
dan is hoping that they will be
foothills to a winning season.

Coach ‘ Ed Shockey’s yearlings
promise to throw a two-way
team against the Cubs. He has
tagged his offensive unit the “Go,
Go”»squad, and his defensive club
the “Samcats,” an expression he
uses to describe players with de-
sire. _

. ‘But more impressive than their
classy nicknames is the size of
the Mountaineers probable start-
ing lineup. Shockey boasts a front
wall which averages 215 pounds
a man and a- backﬁeld which
averages 195 pounds on the scale.

Fullback Larry Du_ck leads the
pack of talented runners, with
Richie‘ Martha, brother'of Paul
Martha, and Roger Blackwell at
the halfback slots. Allen McCune,
a running and passing threat,_w;'ll
be calling the signals.

The Mountaineer ‘Frosh will
have the advantage of one game

under their belts before‘ they
meet the Panther Cubs. They
launched their 1962 campaign
against Fair_mont State Monday
