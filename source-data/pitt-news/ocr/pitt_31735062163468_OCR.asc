WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1963 s 

By PAT POLLINO
(See Editorial Page 4) .

Dean Helen Poole Rush, clinging preciously to the right arm of a stately 
chair which could easily have held two of her, may well have been lost in her ‘
chair, but certainly was not at a loss for words as she answered questions Mon-
day at a Student Union Forum Series Administrative Coffee Hour. '-

Program Chairman Mike Marcuse started the questioning with a brief
warmup session for Dean of Women and Dean of Students Rush. She passed
quickly over Marcuse’s queries, stating:

Her two positions do not conﬂict in any way; advisers and chaperones are
provided for by University regulation, and the Dean of Students’ ofﬁce cannot
establish and cannot enforce moral standings, excepteto encourage responsibility
on the part of students. P I

Can’t Be Neutral '

“We cannot be neutral on questions of responsibility,” said Dean Rush. “W0
like to think of students as individuals, not in body. If we counsel a student, it is ‘ in
to help him see what consequences will be.” ,

Then came the barrage of questions from the audience. Women’s' cur-
fews, housing regulations, morals and Saga Food were extremely popular
topics for the afternoon. g M

‘ According to Dean Rush, women's curfews have been decided by the Student 
Housing Board, made up of women students. Students are not appointed to boards '

Apartment Question

The question of women over 21 living in apartments arose, and with it. 
came Dean Rush’s reply- '

“When the‘University provides housing (dorms), it is the assumption
that it is partvof the educational purpose of the University, a part of academic
community life. It’s not because we don't think women aren’t mature enough
to live outside the University,'but because of inadequate housing facilities in

the area that the University provides women students with housing facilities,”

she said.

She also noted that physicalprotection is a- determining factor in a woman’s- I

Last Lecture
Begins Series

With Dr. Tuden

Dr. Arthur Tuden will discuss
"The Negro and Social Change
in America” as if it were the
last ‘lecture he would give.

This November 18 noon lecture
in the SU lower lounge will be
the ﬁrst lecture _of the school
year in the unique “Last Lec-
ture” series.

Receiving -his undergraduate
training at Yale, Dr. Tuden pur-
sued his Ph.D. studies at North-
western University, the London
School of Economics, and the
John Hopkins School for Ad-
vanced Studies.

Speaking from -an Anthropolo-
gist‘s viewpoint, Dr. Tuden will
give a brief history of the Negro
movement. Folowing up the im-
plications of change in the Amer-
ican social structure if Negro de-
mands are realized, Tuden then
will disuss the adverse possibili-
ties of the frustration of Negro
demands.

The" Black Muslin movement, an
organization that, to a large ex-
tent, grew out of Negro frustra-
tion, will be analysed in terms of
organization, policy, and mean-
ing.

vChatncellor Meets ,With Press

Dr. Edward H. Litchﬁeld,
Chancellor of the University,
met with members of the
Press, radio and television
last week to answer their
questions about the new
center established to spur re-
search in the ﬁeld of education.

The center, established by a
$85,000 grant from Buhl founda-
tion, will concern itself not only
with primary and secondary edu-
cation, but education at all levels,
even past the_ bachelors to the
professional schools,’ the_ Chan-
cellor announced.  , -

be used to add to the staff and
physical facilities for the pro-
gram. But the chancellor declared
that he expects that the program
will maintain itself indeﬁnitely
and more funds will be forthcom-
ing in the near future.

Good, But Modest, Start
“This is a very good start, but
modest in comparison to what we
expect. We hope to solicit addi-
tional funds from whatever source
we can ﬁnd them. If not for the
center itself, for some related pro-
jects,” Dr. Litchﬁeld said.
Dr. Litchﬁeld revealed that

program.

Asked if the research center
was the ﬁrst of its kind, the
chancellor commented that no
such similar program exists any‘-
where outside of the United States
and this one will be the most com-
prehensive establishment. “It will
be different from all others be-
cause it is not primarily con-
cerned with educators not ex-
clusively devoted to ‘education. It
has a totally new framework

which is not part of any one’
school,” the Chancellor declared. A

The Liberal Arts cabinet, in
‘examining the distribution of
studies program, has come upon
a relatively unknown alternative
to the prescribed distribution for-
mat.

The school of the liberal arts
presently requires a total of 45
credits of distribution of studies
courses divided equally among
the three major divisions of the
school. This, ideally, should break
down to ﬁve different courses
numbered in the 80’s ‘or 180’s,
in the Humanities, the Social
Sciences and the Natural Sci-
ences, respectively.

Some students have expressed
a desire to the L.A. cabinet to
vary their personal distribution
requirements. In response to stu-
the Cabinet has
discovered a little known alter-
native to the present require-
ments.

On page six of the handbook
of the school of liberal arts, cer-
tain ﬁnal degree requirements are
stated, among them the require-
ment of a related discipline to a
major ﬁeld.

In many ﬁelds, a student must

A  Pagelze — THE ‘PITT NEWS — Wednesday, November 13, I963
  LA Cabinet Discovers .
 2 Distribution Alternative

have “a minimum of 24 credits
in his major ﬁeld, and 12 credits
in a related discipline. If a stu-
dent elects to take 12 credits of

work in two related disciplines,
the distribution requirement may
be waived in the division of his
major.”

One example points out the
striking possibilities of this al-
ternative. The Psychology major
has a choice of related disciplines
that cross departmental lines. If
twelve credits are taken in So-
ciology and Anthropology re-
spectively, both of these Social
Sciences, the Natural Science re-
quirement will thereby be ﬁlled.

The Psychology major, if he
wishes, can thereby fulﬁll the Na-
tural Science Distribution with-
out taking one course in the Na-
tural Sciences. v

This alternative does not work
equally well with all majors. It
does, however, provide most ma-
jors with the opportunity to con-
centrate in depth on__ two related
disciplines rather than acquiring
a broad conceptual knowledge of
ﬁve related ﬁelds.

 

(Continued from Page 1)

a new meaning. It will “take out
a lot of nonsense from education.”
The advisory board will be from
diverse backgrounds in basic re-
search. The chancellor stressed
emphasis in the present under-
taking will be “total research.”
Would it be an administrative
. merger? No, said Dr. Litchﬁeld,
because the focus and emphasis
will be new. “It. will pull in all
our present resources. It will be
bigger and more concentrated.
A clearing house, but much
more. It _will do things that
couldn’t otherwise be done.

“All educational institutions
keep abreast with current. trends
in education. We will be doing
research and come up with some-
research and coming up with
something new,” the chancellor

continued.
Dr. ‘Litchﬁeld added that the
research center may publish

models, also. “We are not in the
publishing business nor are we
a commercial enterprise but we
have the University Press at our
disposal and if there is need for a

them till such.‘ime that someone

in the business takes it up.”
This is all part of a larger

picture, the Chancellor indicat-

‘Hillman Library Set
up To Open Fall of 1966

The new Hillman Library hopefully will be opened by
the fall of 1966, according to Lorena A. Garloch, Associate

SU Handicapped

Committee Formed

Three students have expressed
interest in the student Handicap-
ped Committee, formed in coop-
eration with Larry Heller, co-di-
rectorof the SU Board. ’

A meeting is now being ar-
ranfged with Dr. Alan C. Rankin,
asistant chancellor of Student Af-
fairs, who will inform the students
of the latest action in University
improvements for handicapped
students.

“It is not a question of num-
bers I of people involved here,”
said Heller, “but that these three
‘people are sincerely interested in
being informed on this problem.
The small number of people in-
volved would indicate the seri-
ousness of- purpose of this com-
mittee rather than a failure or
lack of interest.’’,

Communication Purpose

The committee is not an “ac-
tion” committee, said Heller. Its
purpose is communication. “Let

these student voices be heard and

let them hear the administration’s
view,” he said. " ‘ ' '
Heller maintains that the com-
mittee is not interested in the re-
cruiting of more people. He ad-
vises anyone__who migly have an
interest in" joining yet to come to

.his oﬁice. “This is all very sim-
ple,” he ,said_._ ‘,‘There are no d_u- ,
involved, 5only "an? interest‘

ties
need be expressed.” »

,Heller’s office is behind the stu-
dent desk in the SU.

Al proclamation by Pittsburgh ‘

Mayor Joseph Barr will officially
kickoff November 17 to 23 as
Peace Corps in the city.

A Peace Corps information and
recruiting team will be on cam-
pus next week to meet with stu-
dents and answer any questions
they might have.,An information
center will be located in the Stu-
dent Union lobby.

The non-competitive Peace
Corps Placement Test will be
given at the following times at

ﬂoors will be for graduates. The
middle two ﬂoors will be for un-
dergraduates. There will be an
entrance to the second floor from
the outside.

Instead of the long library
tables that are used in the present
library, there will be many small
individual desks. There will also
be a smoking room on every floor,
and the library will be air—condi-
tioned.

What Kind of Furniture?

Planning for the Hillman Li-
brary has progressed so far that
they are now talking about the
type_of wood to be used on the

stone to be used, according to
Miss Garloch. A _
Conversation rooms, 90 fac-
ulty studies, and typing rooms"
are all included in the plans for
the library. There will be typ-
ing rooms with typewriters and
also ones with just typing tables
where students can bring their
own typewriters.

The - undergraduate floors will
have their own periodical room,
microﬁlm, reference service, and
book collection. The reserve books
will be in huge revolving shelves.
The students-have ‘to push a but-
ton for the letter of the book they
want and the shelf. will come
around, Miss Garloch explained.

Library Mechanized

The ~mechanization of ‘ the li-
brary is one of the major features.

itarial: The Clearing Ila use’

‘Dean Helen Poole Rush was magniﬁcent and well deserved the round of ap-
plause she received at the conclusion of Monday’s Administration Coffee Hour in the

SU Lower Lounge.

With much grace and composure, she faced what most people believed would
be an impassioned mob bent on her destruction,‘ and proved to all present that she
could handle herself as well under pressure as in the security of her twelfth ﬂoor office.

, The questions asked of her by the students after the prepared queries were ex-
hausted ranged from ones on women’s curfews to the food served in the cafeteria.
Answering each with a secure conﬁdence in her own position and with a degree of
aplomb seldom seen in one so obviously in the spotlight, Miss Rush cleared up some
misconceptions concerning herself and her operations and shed some light into a few
areas where there might be need for improvement in the future.

Admitting in her introductory remarks that one person could never hope to be
completely informed on every subject in the University, but that she would attempt
to answer every question to the best of her ability, Miss Rush then proceeded to do ex-

actly as she had promised.

When a question demanded a short decisive answer, one was forthcoming; when
a, more detailed explanation was necessary, Miss Rush supplied it; and when she

I ‘really didn’t know the answer, she admitted it.

Possibly,/her most decisive answer came when the question arose concerning her
alleged in_terference in an inter-racial dating situation. She replied that she had never
attempted such interference, and the tone of her voice called to anyone who might
have different ideas to step forward and state their case. None did. i ’i ‘

This, we believe, should establish for all time the validity of her statement, for
no one would dare to make such a reply in front of such a large audience were it not

’ true.

Only in two instances were questions asked which appeared to require more

. discussion than the Coffee Hour could provide. The ﬁrst concerned students whose
, 2 religion prohibits them from eating in the Towers cafeteria, yet who are required to

buy a meal ticket if they wish to live in the dorms. The second was in regard ‘to
possible restrictions on the powers of Women’s Housing Board, the student organiza-

' The ultra-sophisticated, al-

   

' most—high—school-senior trying

to look old, pattern of behav-

' ior so evident here last year is

,on the decline.

Let’s start at the most evi-
dent way of evaluating spirit.
Football games. The University
cheering section that I pain-
fully remember w a s rather
dead, to say the least. But then
we look to the Syracuse game.

During the ﬁrst half, a typi-

' cal University crowd was there

-— cheering only when some-

'thing of major importance

happened like our one touch-
down, not supporting the
cheerleaders, not going out to
make a tunnel for our team.

But the second half brought

. an outburst of spirit. People

were actually cheering when
the cheerleaders weren’t. The
once quiet sophisticates were
yelling and helping Michelosen
coach, just supporting the team
in general. , '

Now to a more subtle aspect
-—-school spirit in general.
Schoool spirit is merely a gross
manifestation of the spirit of
each individual making up the
student body. There can be no
school spirit if each individual
student thinks that the way
to be “cool” is to be blase, to
not express any excitement
about the school, to merely
take it as it is and not really
care one way or. the other.
There can be no school spirit
if students are just here to
study and go to a party or a
show on weekends. There can
be no school spirit if students
don’t take advantage of what
the University offers them, and
then ask for more.

I feel that we were lucky.
We got more. We got more only
because we needed it, but we
got it. We gotthe Towers.

Many of you may be won-
dering what the Towers could’
possibly have to do with school
spirit. I must admit that I was
too. But when I thought about
it, I realized what the Towers
offered the student body.

It oﬁered someplace to go
— to talk, to play bridge, to
play the piano (not on a stage),

  

  

‘ tion which determines curfew hours. Both of these areas‘ require much more study
before the Coffee Hour will have harvested its full potential.

to congregate-.
dents are talking, are playing

bridge, are using the pianos, -

even at 7:30 in the morning.
This very subtle general
feeling is coming ‘out in other
areas, too. Student Government
objected to The Pitt News. In-
stead of just grumbling about
it behind closed doors, Gussie
Smith came. out and made a

.very deﬁnite statement about

her personal feelings toward
the paper. Naturally, I don’t
agree in the least with Miss
Smith. My sentiments were de-
scribed by Stan Stein in his
editorial in the November 4 is-
sue of The Pitt "News. But I
was glad to see someone'bring-
ing her complaints to the fore-
ground not afraid of being at-

tacked or being made to feel,

foolish.

But student leaders aren’t
the only ones taking action.
The student body was given
the Liberal Arts Cabinet, for
example, and they are using
it. Given an official body to
which he can express legiti-
mate complaints, many a stu-
dent has taken the trouble to
write up these complaints and
present them to the Cabinet
so that action could be taken.
Action that, in all possibility,
would be of the most beneﬁt
to students in the future.
And yet they seemed to
care enough about the school
to do something that would be
of beneﬁt to it.

It seems that the more we
are given, the more use we are
making of it. This is our school

_ Which alltendsto say,‘ at 21 one has

It goes without saying that a multitude of co1leg- L

ians turning 21 use the occasion as a passport to every

bar in the Oakland area — and a‘ “draught” card to’

prove their loyalty to Uncle Sam. We are aware, of

, course, that girls also turn 21, but that’s another matter

and another sex, come to think of it.

Lest we not portray college as a playground for
proverbial drunks, perhaps we should examine the
more-‘challenging intellectual gamut of the student turn-

ed 21. Assuming he is now all-wise, that C-plus in ex- 
plository writing becomes an A, via travailing jolts of ‘'

In any event, the ofﬁcial severance of the yoke of
pre-adulthood is representative of a majority at 21. Does
this mean that the individual is any wiser at 21 than he
was at '20? Predicated on time—development, he is “so-

The sole blame for the
failure of the University

Theatre’s “Iphigenia in Aulis”_

production cannot be thrust
upon the performers them-
selves or the production staff.

It was apparent that a great
amount of time and energy were
put into the presentation of Euri-
pides’ tragedy. Ann True, the
costumer, Philip R. Eck, the de-
signer, William Booth, Jr., lighting
director, and Colin Sterne, music
composer, are all deﬁnite pluses in
favor of the production. The cos-
tumes were colorful and properly
regal. The set of the command tent
was impressive and added an aura
of battle and somberness to the
proceedings. The lighting was per-
feet and handled with careful
skill. And the music, while ﬁrst
resembling some Balinese ritual
dance, soon took on the intensity
and excitement needed to set the
stage for the tragedy. All well and
good.

Now to the problem. Euripides’
drama is deﬁnitely one of his less-
er efforts. There are of course some
of the great universal issues to be
found inthe course of the action
but the dr'amatist’s style, so mag-
niﬁcently conceived and present-
edvin-the greatness of ‘_‘The Trojan
Women,” is not to be seen in
“Iphigenia.” V The drama is uneven
and lacks a dignity and grandeur
that establishes “The Trojan Wo-
men’_’ as a ‘noble tragedy. Tragedy
is here, beyond any doubt, but a
certain something, whether it be
a feeling _or another intangible
item, was missing from the pro-
duction, and is missing in a
straight reading of the play.

The plot is a simple one. “The
scene is laid in the command
tent of the Achaean ;Armies be-
side their ships in the gulf at
Aulis. An angry goddess will not

allow the winds to blow the

In The Spotlight

Achaean ships to‘ the sack of Troy
unless a king’s daughter is slain
in human sacrifice.” The king is
Agamemnon. The daughter is
Iphigenia. The queen is Clytem—
nestra. The king brings his daugh-
ter to the tent by
promising to marry
her to Achilles and
when his deception
is discovered a gi-
gantic battle occurs between the
three main principals. This verbal
tirade is aimed at the King and
he iscalled selﬁsh and treacherous
by his wife. In the ﬁrst act it was
Menelaus, his brother, who hurled
a similar verbal attack. All try to
save Iphigenia from death but to
no avail. The gods have handed
down a decision and Agamemnon
must comply. Iphigenia submits
herself to the fates and declares
that she is the possessed of her
country so she, too, must comply.
The tragedy of the king is found
in the words: “Fate ﬁnds for ev-
ery man his misery.”

Howard Slaughter as Agamem-
11011 Produced some forceful
and exciting emoting but then
found himself struggling and
tiring of his part. He was excel-
lent in his scenes with Menelaus
and Iphigenia but stilted and
wavered in his confrontation with
Clytemnestra. The part of the
fated King was very demanding
and Slaughter accepted the chal-
lenge, for the most part, suc-
cessfully. The part of ‘Clytem-
nestra was played by Vasumathi
Krishnasami and she was less
successful than ,
the King. Miss
K r_i shna s a- lnadequuh
m i ’ 5 moments Clyfemnestra
of good acting 
were few and, from this observer’s
view, the , part seemed to be too
much-for her to cope with. Cly-
temnestra is a bitter woman in
the ﬁnal moments and even her
softer dialogue is ﬁlled with an

Simple

with Stan Schweiger

intense emotionalism.

Roberta Rosenthal portrayed
the human sacriﬁce, Iphigenia,
and her performance paralleled
that of the character she portray-
ed. She seemed awkward and
childish in the early moments
and at the end she emerged as a
sensible and creditable young girl.
Miss Rosenthal’s ﬁnal moments
were quite lovely and the sense
of the tragic, otherwise missing
throughout the play, was brought
home well in these moments.

Harvey Miller as Menelaus
gave a ﬁne account of himself
while appearing only in the ﬁrst
act. He made clear to the audi-
ence with deep emotion that
Menelaus’ love for Helen was
the- main reason for the war
and it was too bad that Mr.
Miller's talent couldn't be taken
advantage of in the second act.

Others in the cast and doing
adequate jobs were Alfred An-
drews, Charles Guignon, Richard
Robinson, Miles Auslander, Joyce
Diener, and Terri Supowitz. The
direction by Bernard Engel was,
once again, like a see-saw. Mo-
ments good, moments bad, even,
uneven, etc. There was also a
chorus to set the scene which in-
cluded a lead. Such an idea is in-
teresting when done well. In the
production of “Iphingenia in
Aulis” that I witnessed, the chorus
was downright annoying and only
hindered the presentation. I ne-
glected to mention James Chap-
man’s performance of Achilles. I
will say no more about it.

I definitely think that a larger
and more important work by" Eu-
ripides would have resulted in
success for the University The-
atre-‘Pitt Players. “The play’s the
thing .« . .”. was uttered by Mr.
Shakespeare about 370 years ago
and it would be wise if people
would take his advice before at-
tempting any theatrical endeavor.

 

1200 Cadets Due
For Army Game

The noisiest cheering section in
college football will visit the Uni-
versity Campus Saturday. The
West Point Corps of cadets, 1200
strong, will arrive by bus at 8:30
a.m. ready to whistle and howl
their way through the Panther-
Army game Saturday afternoon.

Their ﬁrst stop will be the Field
House, where they will freshen up
and be treated to a coffee hour.
Following a brunch at 10:30 a.m.
in the Tower’s cafeteria, the

cadets will march up to'the sta-
dium, according to Mrs. Frances
Holland, assistant dean of women.
There’ will be no formal hospital-
ity at the brunch.

An informal get together will
be held in the Student Union fol-
lowing the football game. At this
time 200 University undergradu-
ate women will serve as hostesses,
according to Mrs. Holland. The
hostesses will" introduce Univer-
sity students to the cadets and
will also aid at the evening affair.
There will be folksinging in the
ballroom and refreshments in the
lower lounge during the after-
noon.

Dan Delaney and his 12-piece
orchestra will play at an informal
dance scheduled for 8 to 11:30
p.m. Since the cadets have to
catch their bus back to West Point‘
at this time, the dance must end
early, Mrs. Holland explained.

No dormitory open houses will
be held for the cadets this week
owing to the small hospitality
area that is available to them. The
towers lobby, will be open to the
cadets and hospitality will be pro-
vided there. .

 Coaches Praise Second Team

 

,1/For Rolein Gridolers’ Success

6.

 

. freshman

' coach Bill

By AL BLUMKIN

Most of the credit for

record thus far has gone to Fred Mazurek,
Paul Martha, Ernie Borghetti, and the rest
’ of the ﬁrst team starters. But one-platoon
football, as it existed in the 20’s and 30’s,
is as dead as the dodo bird.

.second unit has played
a large part in achiev-
ing the 6-1 record.
The second unit's
job is spelling the ﬁrst
team. They play an
average of 16 minutes
per game, according to

-~ coach John Michel-
osen. Used mostly on
defense, I the number

two team has been in-
strumental in winning
the Syracuse and
Notre Dame games.

Coach Bimbo Cecconi feels the second string-
ers are a prime reason for the Panthers’ great
"record. “All of them are good football players,”
explained the backﬁeld coach. “They keep the
pressure on the ﬁrst-stringers. The starters have

to hustle to keep their jobs.”

Has Passed Well

The quarterback of the second team is sopho-
“Lucas is a good quarter-
back. He is a leader and has the respect of his
teammates,” said Cecconi. Lucas, in the limited
time he has played on offense has completed 23
of 45 passes for 327 yards and four touchdowns.

An authentic star on the second team is Eric

more Kenny Lucas.

Coach Kaliden
Pleased W’itl1
Cub Gridders

By FRANK smzix

If the strength of a varsity
football team is affected by its
team's successes
then the future for Panther
fans may be as bright as the
present. Although-this season’s
frosh played only two games and
had to settle for an even record,
Kaliden was very
pleased. “These boys have come
faster and developed more than

any of the teams in the past,” he
said. ' .

Originally, this season’s sched-
'ule' posted three games, but a last
minute cancellation by Penn State
changed that. Though Kaliden
had hoped to reschedule the con-
test it now seems impossible. He’s
not too disappointed, however.

“I don’t think that the short-
ened season will hurt us much,”
he stated. “We’re going to con-

"tinue working with the regulars.

We have been helping them a
great deal and at the same time
we have continued to develop
mvell ourselves.”

- Remain Quiet
‘ The entire frosh coaching staff

‘has been elated with the perform-

ances of the Cubs. Even the var-
sity mentors have complimented
their hustle. When it comes to
singling out any special stars,
-however, there has been a‘ much
tighter lipped atmosphere. ’ '

3 "You never really know this
soon how well these youngsters
_will do,” said Kaliden. “Spring
practice will be a much different
situation and many of the boys
will show themselves at that
time. Right now I’d say that all
four tackles will have a good
chance of helping next year.”

Even though the -problems of
practice remain most immediate,
the coaching staff has not been
idle in other areas. “We’ve al_-
ready started making contacts for
future prospects,” noted Kaliden.
“We’ve had a number of groups
in to watch us play and we plan
_¢o,_have,many.more..’’ , V . .

 

  

JOHN TELE SKY

Crabtree. “He is one of the -most exciting
runners we’ve ever had. He has terriﬁc speed,”
said Cecconi. Crabtree leads the team in punt
returns, interceptions, and opponents’ fumbles
recovered. ’

Cecconi was also high in his praise of full-
back John Telesky. The 205-pound senior who
is built like a brick wall is considered one of
the best blocking backs on the club. “He is an
excellent blocker,” said Cecconi. “He could be
a starter on a lot of teams.” .

The line has also played a big part in the
second unit's success. The interiors are Ray"
Popp, Ron‘ Linaburg, Bernie LaQuinta, Paul
Cercel, and Jim Jones. “They are all good, solid
players,” said taskle coach Joe Pullekines. Popp
and Cercel were ﬁrst-stringers until they were
hurt in pre-season practice.

Ends'Do Well

“The ends have done a terriﬁc job,” accord- A
ing to coach Ernie Heiferle. The second—string
terminals l— Bill Howley, John Jenkins,‘ and
Gene Sobolew/ski, who is Jenkins’ defensive re-
placement — have performed well. Howley is
third in pass-receiving on the team. _Jenkins
made two sensational catches against Washing-
ton, which helped beat the Huskies. -I

The third-stringers, those who take. th
pounding when the team is safely ahead or
hopelessly behind, also came in for some credit.’
“Players like Fran Novak and Dale Stewart help
our morale by hustling when they play,” said
Cecconi. ‘

“While the majority of praise rightfully goes
to the starters, if we didn’t have a good second
unit we wouldn’t be where we are,’.’ Cecconi
said.

not been a one man force
against the opposition.

A pair of rangy defensemen
-—-Cal Bonawitz and George
Sommer —— have played a major
part in the defensive success of
the Panthers and Staab, who

' has allowed less than one goal a

game.

Bonawitz, a fullback, has a
penchant for clearing the ball
when he needs to. Sommer, a
wiry, agile halfback, has a
knack for weaving and bobbing
around his _opponents.

“I always feel I could do
better,” Bonawitz said. “I still
have to work on my ball con-
trol, -but it's coming along.”

Bonawitz was pulled off the

‘bench at West Virginia and in-

serted at center forward, where
he promptly scored a goal dur-
ing the few seconds he was in
the game. “I went in, the’
ball came, and I just kicked it
in,” he said, “that’s all; it shock-
ed me.”

their win over Pi Kappa Alpha on
Monday.

The score was 13-6 and the
Delts won it in double overtime
on a ﬁve yard run by Jim Dockey.
The Delts’ ﬁrst score came on a
kickoff return by Jim ‘ Wallace.
PiKA’s only score was a ﬁve yard
return of an- interception by Don
Sweeney. "

To play the PiKA’s the Delts
beat Theta Chi, only after tieing
them in three straight games. The
Delts ﬁnally won in double over-
time of the third game when it
was decided to set the ball on
the ﬁfty yard line once for each
‘team and the team who got the
most yards in four downs would
win. The Delts won, 22-15 yards.

commented, “but I know we

Although he didn't single out

any one swimmer as being oﬁ to

an exceptionally ﬁne start,
Grady felt that he. had some
boys with a. lot of potential.
He cited -sophomore diver Don
Hahnfeldt and soph-omore_
sprinter Andy James as “two

He also mentioned that senior

soccer since coming here. “I
wasn’t even sure I would have
a chance to play when I joined
the freshman team last year,”
he said, “especially when I saw
six scholarship players on the
squad.” Now he is the starting
right halfback on the varsity.
“After our team (the fresh-
man) had gone undefeated last
year and I had come out as sec-
ond leading scorer,” Sommer
said, “I had felt conﬁdent.
“Then, when I joined the
varsity, and we started to
play harder teams,” he relat-
ed, I thought it would take a
whole season for the inex-
perience to be worked out.
When we beat Frostburg
(4-0) early in the season, I
got a. lot of my conﬁdence
back.”

The team has begun to talk
on the field, and Sommer has
become one of the head “cheer-
leaders.” Talking by him and
the others has helped coordi-
nate team play and stiffen the
defense. But the skills of Bona-
witz and Sommer have in
themselves foiled one offensive
threat after another and have
gained much praise from op-
posing coaches. '

j.Questioned

By Students

 (Continued from Page 1)

 “Sign-out sheets exist so that
F . a girl can be contacted in an
emergency,” said Dean Rush.
“We encourage students to be
honest in this respect, but do

, ‘not check up on them.”

_ The topic of discrimination was
 brought to the fore, and Dean
' Rush asked if she had ever taken
it :upon herself to encourage for-
. eign students to date American
“girls. She maintained that it was
up to the individual to select a
«. partner.
Integrate Greeks?

“What has the Dean of Stu-
, dents’ office done to integrate fra-
 ternities and sororities, racially
..-_and religiously?” a student asked.

According to Dean Rush, or-
ganizations must have discrim-
‘ inatory clauses removed from
their bylaws by 1965. Other
. than that, she ‘stated each group
has a right to select its own
members.

Mandatory meal tipkets for
dorm students and the absence of
kosher food in the cafeteria was
put before Dean Rush as a prob-
-lem. She said: » '

/' “Minor Problem”

“I consider it a very minor
problem. It has come to my at-
_ tention only indirectly. It would

be difficult for the Food Service
to prepare food to please every-
one.”.

Asked why students were able
_to purchase a two-meal lunch
ticket in the spring and not
for the fall or winter terms,
Dean Rush explained that ap-
parently it had been economic-
ally unfeasible to arrange for

a two-meal ticket for the fall

and winter.

A On the subject of morals, Dean

Rush summed up her feelings.

when questioned about possible

grounds for expelling a student.
Dismissal Rare

“Dismissal of a student is a rare
thing,” she said. “Our job is to
keep students in the University
~ A; . . unless they are unable to
_live constructively with other
people.”

She added that she refrains
A ’from making a decision-
one way of the otl1er—until she
has talked with the person and
weighed the matter thoroughly.

Dean Rush ﬂashed a warm
smile-—the same smile she main-
tained throughout the program-
when she told the audience a stu-
dent's responsibility is both a
right and a privilege--and arose
from the ‘stately chair to a chorus
of applause.

 Players Initiate

75 New Members

The Pitt Players initiated ap-
proximately 75 new members fol-
lowing I the University Theatre’s
presentation of Euripedes’ Iphi-
genia in Aulis.

“Out of the 150 who applied,”
commented Jeffrey iRash, presi-

dent of Pitt Players, “these 75 or
so new people about to be initi-
ated have demonstrated their
value sulﬁciently to allow them a
junior membership in our organi-

  

zation. Ho,w_ever,-- they must dis-
play -a further willingness to work

if they are to achieve our next"

stage of advancement, senior
membership.
“It's surprising how we’ve

grown from an almost minute
group of 45 people to an over-
whelming mass of over 180 souls,”
Rash observed. “Admittedly only
100 of them are working on pro-
duction and organizational activi-
ties at the moment. But, we need
that other 80 in reserve when
we’re supporting the kind of
drama program the University
Theatre is after.”

A completely new Ford Motor Company 3-speed

. . . better start-ups (up to 35% higher torque

With the introduction of this lighter, highly

Comet, Fairlane and Ford models, our engié

putting extra pep per pound into Ford-built cars.

 

Simpliﬁed gear case design and a one-piece
