Fall Grads ~
To Register
For Positions

By IRV POPKIN

February—male graduates should
register with the University Place-
ment Bureauifor the fall recruit-
ing season, Paul M. Sherwood,
head of the bureau urged Friday.

On Oct. 31, representatives of
110 companies, varying in size and
occupation, will come to the uni-
versity to interview prospective
employees.

Jobs for engineers, accountants,
and non-technical men will be of-
fered by all the big Pittsburgh dis-
trict companies plus many nation-
al ones. -

Draft Status Minor

Included in this group are:
Ketchum, MacLeod & Grove lnc.,
Boeing Aircraft, United States
Steel, Westinghouse, K r 0 g e r s ,
Goodyear,,_General Motors, Radio
Corporation of America, Mellon
Bank, and Burroughs Inc.

Military obligations will have

little or no bearing on hiring.

“All companies,” Mr. Sherwood

emphasized, “want to talk with

«graduates whether they face im-

mediate military service or not.

Some companies hire graduates

having only a few months of

civilian life remaining.”

Before an interview, the Place-
ment Bureau equips the graduate
with knowledge of the company
they wish to work for and instruc-
tions for “selling themselves” to
the interviewer. so

Instructions Given

They will then be given a mim-
eog’raphed information sheet to
study. On this they can find the
name of the company, the positions
it offers, the amount of schooling
or degree it requires, and any oth-
er speciﬁcations the company
wants of its future employees.

From this sheet, the graduate

can choose the company or com-

panies that best ﬁt his wants,
education and pe1'sonality.‘“The

Bureau then offers the graduate

literature describing" the history,

functions, and aims of his chos-
en company.

.In addition to the services for
graduates, the bureau provides
full time and part time employ-
ment for day and night students.
Some of these jobs are advertised
on the ground floor bulletin board.

Hall Pedestrians Threatened. . .

Out-door Traffic E O   E E "

. By Judy Gotterer
'*~ The out-door trafﬁc problem, which has been
cussed, debated, and discussed by all aﬂiliated with
the University, has now entered the limestone halls
of the Cathedral. And it may get worse.

With an increase in enrollment, manipulation
of ﬂoor space between classes has become such a
problem that doors ﬂung open by students burst-

 

Congestion, slowing down the ﬂow of traﬁic
to and from classes, originates from a diversity of

The mechanics behind classroom doors hinders
the ﬂow. The majority of them open at right angles
to their frames, automatically dominating one-
third'of the hall space. ‘If present hinges were re-
placed by refrigerator hinges, doors, could fold

  

back ﬂush against the wall.

Between classes, every door should be anchored “ 

open to eliminate the ‘-hazard students create by P
‘ swinging doors open‘ abruptly. -
Door Numbers Needed _ '  A
Room numbers should also be placed on both
sides of the door for easy room identiﬁcation when
the door is open or shut. This creates an especial
problem during class changes when it is most
necessary to be ableito read room numbers.
The excellent signs over the ‘stairway exit)
designatingtdirection of rooms, loses their eff_ective- ,r
ness when these numbers arehidden on open class-
room doors. 7 '
Students themselves could help eliminate the _
problem by congregating against the walls in the
corridors rather than in the center of the hall.
Elevators Contribute
And to make matters worse,_ elevators con-
\I tribute to the confusion even before one enters
the halls. Traﬁic is stopped-gapped by indifferent
kibitzers who are too‘ busy to move over tem-
porarily to permit a trapped passenger at the rear
of the car to exit at his ﬂoor. ,

Although‘ a great part of the general conges-
-tion stems-\ from mechanical diﬁi/culty. a correction
of old-fashioned bad manners mightaid the prob-
lem considerably.

 
 
 
  
     
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
    
  
  
  
  
     
  
   
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
   
   
  
   
  
  
   
 
 
 
  
   

_' The only\Hway the present Oakland parking situation
. could worsen would be for the city to maliciously pro-
‘ ibitv student parking in legal areas during class hours.
The improbability that city officials would do -such a thing
‘seemed so great that the very notion appeared facetious
until last Friday afternoon when students complained to
the proctor, Mr. Berry, that they had received $10 tags for
arking in newly “restricted” areas. .
 -City police had designated the Oakland area -out of
bounds to parking after -noon, so the local newspapers in-
formed. Whether Pittites seem to have the tintie to read the
papers or not is an irrelevant consideration. That many must
d,1five'to,the University isan important ,one. And despite re-
st ictions, they needed those parking places.
.,,~ We are cognizant that streets were cleared for the Eu-
clriarist Rally held at Forbes Field that night. But we should
1ke to know why places had to be evacuated by noon. It
‘ ertainly seems that a 3:30 p.m. or 4:30 p.m. deadline, which
ould, adequately allow for the needs of day students,
could have been established. There was no need for police
to tow away vehicles so early. , f

European Odyssey Completed

By JIlVI MARINO
(Editor’s Note: This is the last
of a current serries of articles con-
cerning the experiences of Pitt
students who studied overseas the
past summer.)

A European odyssey of
pleasure and study ﬁlled the
summer for Nancy Jones, re-
cipient of the Nationality
Rooms Hostess Award. Her
tour included eight countries
from the British Isles to the
Iberian Peninsula.

Nancy docked at Southampton,
England after an eight day jour-
ney aboard the “S.S. Grote Beer.”

In London, Nancy and ,her
companion, Shirley Ritz, met
Vira Mosberger who was vaca-
tioning in Europe. The three Pitt
co-eds toured London’s famous
sites: the House of Commons,
the London Times office, Trafalgar
Square, Buckingham Palace, and,
as Nancy said, “All the places an
American ‘simply must see’ in
London.” .
Scotland Cold

In Scotland the weather was
cold and damp. In the fog Nancy
saw the medieval castle of Edin-
burgh “looming on a high and
steep-sided hill.” The heavy
weather continued as Nancy view-
ed the highlands around Glasgow.
Her hostess, Miss Barbaza Napier
said, “This is beautiful scenery, if

, you could only see it!”

After a quick trip across the
channel and a brief visit to the
Hague and Amsterdam, Holland,
Nancy ﬂew to Berlin. There she
stayed with the family of Eva-
Koester, who was once an ex-

’ . change student at Nancy’s high

school, in West View, Pa. “Stay-
ing with the Koesters was one
of the best experiences of my‘
trip,” she said, “because it gave
me a glimpse of German family
life.” V

They had quaint customs such
as shaking hands while bidding
each other ‘good night’ and re-
peating the ritual at breakfast
every morning.

On July 14, French Bastille Day,
Nancy Jones arrived in Paris. She
viewed a parade on the Champs
Elysee and, in the evening, Watch-
ed a ﬁreworks display in front of
the White church of Sacre Coue
in Montmarte. '

Joins Press at ‘Summit’ .

The Big Four “Summit” talks
were in’ progress when Nancy
reached Geneva, Switzerland. She
attended the press conference with
1600 journalists from all over the
world, at the Maison ,de la Presse.
During the interim before the ﬁnal
news broke on the talks, she met
President Eisenhower’s press sec-
retary, Jim Hagerty.

In Barcelona, Spain, Nancy‘
studied language at the Univer-
sity. She said that the lectures
were conducted in Spanish and
were held at all hours of the day
and night, from 7 a.m. to mid-
night.

“There were many signs read-
ing ‘Fe En Franco’ (Faith in
Franco) around the city and espe-
cially around the University of
Barcelona.” Nancy noted, “How-
ever, while there is much objec-
tion to Franco the people seem
resigned to accepting him as their
leader. 4

The many soldiers in the cities
of Spain lead me to believe that

Bemis Booters Bomb Rockets '

 

In First Home Soccer Match

A rock-ribbed defense and a fast—moving offense again‘
made the winning combination as Coach Leo Bemis’ booters
downed Slippery Rick 4-1 on the "Stadium turf last Friday
-in the ﬁrst home tilt of the season.. The Panthers were never
behind, although tied at 1-1, as they scored single goals in

each of the four periods.

For most of the ﬁrst quarter the battle raged between

the 25-yard lines with neitheié

side making a serious threat. Sam-
my Hazou ﬁnally broke the scor-
ing ice for the Pittites with a
head-on shot of 15 yards. The
Slippery Rock goalie never saw
the ball as it hit in the corner of
the net. ’

‘A foul by Jack Hester in front
of the home net gave the Rockets
a chance to tie the score on a
penalty kick; they did. Boyle con-
verted for the visitors and the
score at the end of the”quarter
was 1-1. This was the -ﬁrst score
by Panther opponents this sea-
son. V-

Hazou Sparks Team

Hazou gave the home forces the

period ‘on a bit of razzle-dazzle.
Taking the ball at about mid-ﬁeld,
Hazou proceeded to dribble his

[way through the entire Slippery

Rock degense and ‘ﬁnally placed
his ‘goal from a difficult angle t
the right. g ‘

This was the sparkothat was
needed to ﬁre-up the rather list-
less Pitt attack. The rest of the
quarter found "the ‘Rockets pen-
ned up in their own territory
with ‘both J erry, Bressanelli and
Bob Cherry hitting the goal posts
but not scoring.

The tally reached 3-1 in the
third quarter as the Panthers
again dominated the play. Repeat-
edly, Cherry, Bressanelli, Paul
Griffiths, and Karl Sheil drove
shots that were turned awayronly
at the last instant. The ‘inevit-
able happened mid-way in the
quarter on some ﬁne teamwork
with Bressanelli scoring. ..

over but didn’t get anywhere and
after the ball changed hands a
few times, the ﬁrst period ended
with no score. '

At the start of the second pe-
riod, a pass from Toln Kay to
Louis Durbin set the ball up near

THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE sMoocH‘

__:

I On campus Malghhum

(Authbr of “Barefoot Boy with Cheek," etc.)

   
     
     
   

Back in my courting days (the«ra_ccoon coat was all the rage, '
everybody was singing Good Mo'fni-ng, Mr. Zip, Zip, Zip and,-
young Bonaparte had just left Corsica) back, I say, in my court-
ing days, the standard way to melt a girl's heart was to write
poetry to her. ‘ . ‘ 

Young men today have abandonedithis gambit, and I must ‘
say I don’t understand why. Nothing is quite as effectiveas
poetry for moving a. difficult girl. What’s more, poems are ~
ridiculously easy to write. The range of subject matter is end-
less. You can write a poem about a’ girl’s hair, her eyes, her nose, ,
her lips, her teeth, her walk, her talk, her clothes, her shoes-'--_
anything at all. Indeed, one of my most lambent love lyrics was‘ _
called To Maud’s Pencil Box. It went like this:

In your clear little leatherette pencil boa:
_ Are pencils of- yellow and red,

And if you don’t tell meyou love mesoon,

I’ll hit you on top of thehead. .

Honesty compels me to admit that this poem fell short 6:-
success. Nothing daunted, I wrote another one. This time I_ »f
pulled‘ a switch;  threatened myself instead of Maud ‘ 2'

Oh, Maud, pray stop this drivel

And tell me you'll be mine‘, -
_ For my sweetbreads they do shrivel

And wind around my spine. ' ‘

My heart doth cease its beating.
My spleen uncoils and warps.
My liver stops secreting.

Soon I needs be a corpse.

When this heart-rending ballad failed to move Maud, I could
only conclude that she was cruel and heartless and that I Was’
better off without her. Accordingly, I took back my Hi-Y pin,
bidlher adieu, and have not clapped eyes upon her since. Lastl »
heard of her, she was in North Scituate, Rhode Island, working’

as a clam sorter.

\

~’Lbere‘5‘/z0.te1Lirze~, tzereit would. fzaveerzde/.£f~5/ze-/za//z't-bee/z'ai'J/ZCJ , 

But I did not mourn Maud long,,for after Maud came Doris- ' ,,
Doris of the laughing eyes, Doris of the shimmering hair, Doris .. V’
of the golden tibiae! Within moments of meeting her, I whipped ' 
up atorrent of trochaic tetrameter: « — . . ’ '1-

Oh, my sweet and dulcet Doris!
You're gentle as a Philip Morris,
With its mild and rich tobacco ‘
And its white and scarlet pack-o,
Both in regular and Icing-size.
Doris, tell me please your ring size.

Well, of course, the poor girl couldn't resist a poem like that-
what girl could?—and she instantly became my sla’ve. For the
«rest of the semester she carried my books, washed my car, and f1
cored my apples. There's no telling where it all would have
ended if she hadn't been drafted. ‘ —

So, men, you can see the efficacy of poetry as an aid to wooing.
Try it soon. All yomneed is a rhyming dictionary, a quill pen,
and a second-hand muse. om: Bhulman, 1953
