Paterno
fired as
Penn State
coach

The Philadelphia Inquirer
(MCT Campus)

PHILADELPHIA — Penn State’s
football coach Joe Paterno has

a been ﬁred by school’s board of

trustees. In addition, the long-
serving President Graham B.
Spanier is out as a result of fallout
from the sex abuse scandal that
has rocked the school.

_Penn State’s‘ board of trustees
accepted Spanier resignation,
the board announced Wednes-
day night. A I  

Bothrnen have been under ﬁre
since a grand jury report emerged
late last week, charging that for-
mer assistant football coachjerry
Sandusky had molested young
boys on Penn State’s campus dur-
ing a period of years. Two uni-
versity administrators also were
charged in the case for perjury and
failure to report a crime.

When told of a 2002 alleged
sexual assault by Sandusky on a
10-year-old boy, Paterno notiﬁed
University officials but not law
enforcement.

Spanier acknowledged that
one of his administrators told him
about the incident in involving
Sandusky, but said that it was only
described as “horseplay.”

Since arriving at Penn State in
1995, Spanier has been credited
with increasing fundraising and
enrollment and starting a pleth-
ora of new programs and initia-
tives. In 2010, his contract was
extended by the board of trustees
to 2015. I

The keytoasuccessﬁil Student Govem—
ment Board president is experience,
accordingtothetwo current SGB board
members rtmning for the position of
2012 SGB president.
CurrentBoardmembersandseniors
John Hasley and James Landreneau
share similarideaswhenitcomestothe

, changes theywanttobringto Pitt, their

goal beingto increase student involve-
ment in University decision-making,
but they want to implement them in
different ways.

The Pitt News: What signiﬁcant
changes have you made since your
term on the 2011 Board?

John Hasley: Back when I was an
interim Board member, I focused on

the voter registration campaignbefore
the gubernatorial and senatorial races
 I ran on for Board last semester on
the BlackBoard app for smartphone,
which got implemented over the sum-
mer... Astudent approached me about
why we don’t have signs forthe shuttles
like CMU does  So right now Public
Works is just checking with the Traffic
Department that the areas I pointed
out are okay for signage.

James Landreneau: I ﬁnally got
housing to implement the new swipe-
in system at residence halls  and it
shouldbe irnplementedallacross cam-

committee work, and Board member
Emily Hoover and I spearheaded the

StudentAdvisory Boardto revamp the
program that many students saw as

failing.

TPN: What can you bring to the
Board as president that you gained

- from already being a Board member?

JH: Hardwork and dedication, but
also a realwillingness to deal with stu-
dents, hearwhatthey have to say: their
side ofthe story... Ithinkit’s important
thatstudents come andtalkto us, espe-
cially about allocations, because there’s
so much that can be missed if those
lines of communication are broken
down. I’m 100 percent willing to do
that, because I was a Board member,
and I’m willing to as the president.

]L: If I had a bunch of ideas that
were relevant as a Board member, I’d
run for Board member again. But the
projects Fm running on aren’t relevant
for what a Board member would do 
Past Boards ran on beingatransparent

Retired Army Col. Edward Shames
has jumped out of a plane 107 times,
but that doesn’t mean that it got any
easier for him.

“I think it’s ridiculous to jump
out of an airplane,” Shames said
with a smile as the crowd began
laughing.

Shames, who was featured in the
2001 HBO series “Band of Broth-
ers,” spoke about his training and
experience as a paratrooper during
World War II and more at the lecture,
“A Brother’s Tale.” The Wednesday
night event at the O’Hara Student
Center was sponsored by Pitt’s Of-
ﬁce of Veterans Services and the
College of General Studies Student

45-minute lecture and Q&A, some
standing against the walls as they
listened to Shames speak. About 60
Army ROTC cadets were present.

Shames, who will be 90 next

June, enlisted in the Army in 1942

at age 19. He became part of the
506th Parachute Infantry Regiment,
a newly formed group of highly
specialized Army soldiers in Fort
Monroe, Va.

“We had an obstacle course made
by the devil himsel ,” Shames said.
“It was destroyed after we went
through basic training.”

After ﬁghting in Normandy on
D-Day in 1944 and later in Holland,
Shames joined Easy Company in Bas-
togne. It was during this period that
Shames became the ﬁrst enlisted
man in the 101st Airborne Division
to receive a battleﬁeld commission,
where he was promoted to oﬂicer.

see Board members attending student
organizations’ meetings.

JL: I’rn runningon creatingan SGB

Allocations Committee is responsible
for student groups  It’s absolutelyes-
sential that the Board sends an email
aboutwhya group hasbeen funded its
money, has notbeen funded that mon-
ey, or why the decision was reversed
from the Allocations recommendation
 I also think the Allocations Manual
needs to be reviewed again because
decision making is not as clear.

oversaw a platoon of 40 to 45 men.
“I had some of the ﬁnest soldiers
in the American Army,” Shames
said.
He spoke about the book and the
HBO series, “Band of Brothers.” The
book is an account of Easy Compa-

ny’s war experiences, from training.

to Operation Market Garden to the
liberation of concentration camps.
Shames received a copy of the
book before itwas released and had
a few arguments with the author,
Stephen Ambrose,‘ about the facts.
“No one company did any more
than any other company in the Para-
chute Infantry,” Shames said. “These

books comment on ‘I and me’ more -

than ‘we and they.’”

Shames said the amount of curse '

words in the book was not reﬂective
of how the soldiers spoke.

However, Shames did acknowl-
edge that the book elevated a part
of World War II to the public eye.
Before, “no one really was interested
in it,” he said.

Although many people regard
the soldiers in World War II as the

' “greatest generation,” Shames said

he doesn’t agree. He thinks his gen-
eration is no better than any other

generations who have fought in .

wars.

At the end of the lecture, Den-'

nis Renner, beneﬁts coordinator
for the Office of Veterans Services,
presented a Terrible Towel and
plaque to Shames for visiting cam-
pus, acknowledging that Shames has
visited the troops in Iraq and other
colleges and bases because “he loves
to do this.” ,
Senior Katie Muller, an Army
ROTC cadet, said it was interesting
to hear Shames talk about his dif-

“He said he isn_’t a hero, but I
know he is,” Muller said.

Senior Brett Gedman said
Shames “told it like it is, mixing a
lot of humor and accounts.” Gedman
said he was inspired by how Shames
lived for “something greater than
himself.” _

“There are not that many World

think people take these men for

Vietnam War veteran Dennis Di-
Bon, of Indiana Township, agreed.

“We are losing them and they did

The Book Center plans for store renovations

Breanna Durham
Staﬁwri ter

The Book Center will be renovated, but exactly
when those renovations will begin, how long

~' they will take and where The Book Center will

be housed during renovation is still unclear.
Debra Fyock, the interim director of The

Book Center, said that renovations were sup-

posed to begin next semester, but have been

. pushed back to the summer partly because she

is waiting for student input on the plans. An
exact start date has not yet been set.

“The Book Center renovation is‘ in the plan-
ning and schematic design phase, and there
is really not much substantive information
to report at the moment,” Fyock said in an

‘email. a _ .
, Fyock said The Book Center will deﬁnitely .

be housed in a new location while the renova-
tions are taking place,_and that they are cur-
rently looking at a variety of on— campus loca-
tions. She said she hopes to see renovations
completed by the start of next fall semester.

In mid-October, a poster with the ﬂoor
plan for the store’s new look sat in front of
one of the help desks. Within a few days, the
plans quickly changed and Fyock took it down
to make revisions. But those changes are not
set in stone.

Some of the new additions planned so far

include a technology center that provides mul-

along with a coffee shop and an elevator.

Fyock would not release additional details
at this time because the ﬂoor plans “are con-
stantly changing? but said that she will provide
more information as it becomes available.

Although The Book Center will undergo
big changes, students will still be able to pur-
chase new and used books, eBooks and rental
books. University students, faculty and staff
will still get the 10 percent discount on general
reading books.

High school
science lacking

Science majors often complain
about their weekly workload, but
statistics show their classes aren’t
just difﬁcult —— they’re dispirit—
ing.

As The New York Times reported
last Friday, awhopping 40 percent
of science and engineering students
switch majors or, worse, don’t earn
a degree. If pre—med students are
included, that statistic increases to
60 percent — twice the combined
attrition rate of all other majors.

The Times’ sources cited a vari-
ety of reasons for this phenomenon,
including the comparative leniency
of humanities and social sciences
courses and the so-called “death
march” of strenuous, impersonal
freshman-year lectures in physics,
chemistry and calculus.

These factors no doubt contrib-
ute to the high attrition rate. But
they hardly explain why the United
States is lagging behind countries
like Singapore in science test
scores. The chemistry curriculum
for, say, the National University of
Singapore entails the same overload
of intensive, wide-ranging intro-
ductory classes as most American
universities do.

Instead of on tough college
courses, we think a large portion of
the blame rests on American public
high schools.

We all remember what our
secondary-level science classes
involved: catalyzing basic chemi-
cal reactions and constructing
Rube Goldberg machines. These
activities were fun, but they hardly
prepared us for the rigors of Gen-
eral Chemistry or Basic Physical
Science. The fundamental skills

_needed to excel in college — ap-
plying advanced mathematics to
real—world scenarios, understand-

ing chemical bonds — were simply
not emphasized.

Several studies suggest our ex-
periences aren’t anomalous. A 2005
report from the National Research
Council of the National Academies
concluded that most Americans
lack “scientiﬁc literacy,” and that
neither this nor “an appreciation
for how science has shaped the so-
ciety and culture is being cultivated
during the high school years.”

Indeed, science scores in the I

most recent National Assessment
of Educational Progress were
abysmal; only 21 percent of 12th-
graders performed at or above the
proﬁcient level. Although-these
scores can’t be compared to those
of previous tests because they use
a new framework, they nonetheless
inspired widespread disappoint-
ment among educators.

Science instruction is ailing
for a variety of reasons — The
Washington Post’s Valerie Strauss
blames the No Child Left Behind
Act — but, whatever the case, U.S.
high schools will need to overhaul
their curricula if they want to re-
main competitive.

Again, a deﬁcient scientiﬁc
background probably isn’t the only
reason so many prospective Ameri-
can science and engineering majors
grow disheartened — grade inﬂa-
tion in the humanities engenders a
dangerous GPA disparity that might
not be mirrored in other countries
(according to a recent Wake For-
est University study, introductory
English courses impart the high-
est grades, and chemistry courses
impart the lowest). However, if
we want to address the problem
of large attrition rates, there’s
no better place to start than high
schools. -

THE STAMATTACK

Market Square e itomizes
balanced urban esign    

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

After a quick journey on the 71A last
Wednesday, I arrived at the quiet Gold-
en Triangle Plaza near PPG Place. A

The location I speak of, Market
Square, is Pittsburgh’s oldest pub-
lic square and the only speciﬁcally
designated public area on the city’s
eighteenth-century map, and thus,
probably the most Pittsburgh place
onearth.The latest renovations to the
location occurred slightly over a year
ago, and now that they’ve settled into
place, they can be viewed as a symbol
of Pittsburgh’s progress.

The old square, in many ways,
symbolized the old city. In the ’9os,
large planters and walls obstructed
many sightlines, makingthe square a
haven for drug dealers and the home-
less. Trafﬁc, including buses from all
the Oakland routes, ran down the
middle in a constant ﬂow of engines
and exhaust. The square epitomized
the urban gritand chaos thatsent Pitts-
burghers and city dwellers all over the
country racing to the suburbs. |

Today the buses are gone, and
Forbes Avenue doesn’t even run
through the middle. The planters
and walls, too, have been replaced by

a large, stylized concrete slab dotted
with trees ,and tables.

As is the case with anything new,
some of the initial reactions to the
space were negative. Last Septem-
ber, one student complained to Point
Park’s The Globe that it looked like a
parking lot. I agreed; the square was
certainly cleaner; but mainly because
the chaos and dirt had been replaced
by nothing.

In short, the square became more
suburban. Pittsburgh gave up part of
its gritty “charm” to compete with the
standardized world of parking lots and
cleanliness. The businesses changed
too: Old bars and gritty retailers were
largely replaced by a combination of
national and regionalfastfood restau-
rants and boutique local eateries.

I don’t see this suburban transfor-
mationas negative anymore, however.
On the pleasant, autumn afternoon
I visited, the quietness of the square
was arefreshingcontrastto the sound
of car horns less than a block away.
The uniformity of the decor and the
familiarity of many of the establish-
ments were also comforting. Most
importantly, however, the concrete
slab providedwhatispossiblythe most
gratifying quality of the suburbs —
open space.

Don’t get me wrong — the sky-

scrapers and hustle and bustle sur-
rounding the area mean that the
square is unquestionably urban, But
this slight nudge to a more suburban
and balanced environment under-
scores how, from a design perspec-
tive, Pittsburgh is attaining balance
on abroader scale.

Design improvements are the most
overlooked aspects of the city’s renais-
sance. Byfailingto grow much afterthe
sixties, Pittsburgh avoided the worst
planningfeatures ofthe era: the growth
of distant exurbs, mega highways and
volatile real estate markets. A

Consequently, the undesirable
economic and social consequences of
these developments never ﬁtlly reso-
nated here. Land prices and commute
times remained low, whilethe positive
personal interactions associatedwith
urban living remained high. Even in
the worst of the steel recession, down-
town Pittsburgh remained vibrant, at
least during the day.

With the rise of urbanism and
higher-density development prac-
tices, many cities across the nation
are racing to roll back some of the
negative changes that Pittsburgh never
endured. New Urbanism, as it’s called,
ishotindesign schools, with graduates

geous urban design.

. What Market Square shows is that
Pittsburgh doesn’t need to do much to
achieve the New Urbanist ideal. Las
Vegas, Fresno and other similar cities
must spend billions to urbanize their
suburbs and create their own Market
Squares. Our pathis much simpler and
much cheaper ——~ the Market Square
renovations only cost roughly $5
million. With just the small addition

of suburban characteristics —— open
space, livability and some uniformity
—we can capitalize on the charm and
potential of our urban areas.

In places like Station Square, East
Liberty, Oakland and now Market
Square, we’ve already begun this pro-
cess. Just imagine a Pittsburgh with
similar successes in places like Up-
town, Garfield and Hazelwood.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

There is a lesson to be learned
from those marching and chanting
in support of Joe Patemo outside of
his house on Old<Main. What we are
seeing at Penn State is a live display

_ -of an institutional failure. Yes, Penn

State is]oePa, butwhile legacy is one‘
thing, reality is another. His response
was wrong — he should have imme-
diately called the police. The fact that
he did anything else is inexcusable
and indefensible.

The football program, adrninis—
tration and]oePa all share responsi-

bility for what is happening. By not
calling the police and taking imme-
diate action, they tacitly consented
to inaction. The idea that this may
simply go away on its own now seems
to be one that they found acceptable.
While hindsight may be 20/20, even
Mr. Magoo would know what to do if
this was in front of him.

“Keep Calm”: bad slogan, but
worse follow-through. The stu-
dents’ Pavlovian defense of JoePa
is not calm. Okay, schoolspirit, but
if you’re defending anyone but the
kids in this situation, you need to lay
off the spirits. The most important

thing for a university is integrity, and
Penn State has lost a whole lot of it.
I would hope we would have enough
to admit we were wrong, not abdicate
the responsibility of a coach because
we like him. If this were to happen at
Pitt, instead of the posters and chants,
I suggest pitchforks and torches out-
side of the registrar, demanding your
money back.

Sincerely,
Mark Brasacchio

WHAT TO DO THIS WEEKEND

 

Go beyond classic art, explore different museums

Written By Molly Ebert

Everyone has heard of the Carnegie
Museum of Art, the Andy Warhol
Museum and The Frick Art & His-
torical Center, but for a little variety
in your museum-going adventures,
here are a few spots in the Pittsburgh
area you may have missed.

Bicycle Heaven
1800 Preble Ave., Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh’s recent love affair
with bike riding has found a home
base in Bicycle Heaven.

For cyclists, this antique bike
museum and repair shop is located
in the R.}. Casey Industrial Park right
off the North Shore Trail. For owner
Craig Morrow, the museum has been
an idea 20 years in the making and
this pastjuly, he ﬁnally realized his
dream.

“A lot of people say it’s breath-
taking,” Morrow said of visitors’
reactions during their ﬁrst trip to
Bicycle Heaven.

Encased in a massive two-ﬂoor
warehouse, the museum’s bicycle
collection is estimated to be in the
thousands. The bikes date back to
the 1860s, and the collection is the
result of 30 years of hunting in ﬂea
markets, advertising in newspapers
and even posting signs on telephone
poles.

Right now, the museum’s layout,
with a plethora of exhibition rooms,
does not have aparticular order, but
Morrow prefers it this way.

“It gets people to spend more
time and really get the whole view-of
what bicycles are about,” he said.

Bicycle Heaven recently held its
first bike show, swap meet and party,
which gave bike vendors and enthu-
siasts a chance to buy, sell and trade
vintage bicycles and bicycle parts. In
addition to bike-related events and
an increase in tour groups, Morrow’s
plans for the future of the museum
include continuing a past program
in which the museum donates re-
furbished bikes to underprivileged
children.

Bicycle Heaven offers everyone
free admission.

Toon$eum

945 Liberty Ave. # 1, Pittsburgh,

Pa.
Suggested donation $4 for anyone
12 and up

Jpewos fell inlove with cartoon-
ing as achild when his battle with
dyslexia made reading and writing
a challenge rather than an enjoy-
ment. 1

“Cartooning was the one thing I
could do that no one could ever say I
was wrong,” Wos said, “If my draw-
ing looked funny, it was supposed to
look ﬁinny. It was a cartoon.”

Today, as the executive director
of Toonseum, Wos’ love for the no-
barriers art of cartooning is being
shared with Pittsburghers every-
where through art exhibitions and
cartooning workshops.

ToonSeum is located on Liberty
Avenue in Downtown Pittsburgh’s
Cultural District. It appears tiny and
unassuming from the outside, with
only a storefront window looking
into its warmly lit, single-room ex-
hibition space.

But despite the small venue, there
is plenty to see. The inside is a long,
narrow room. Professional cartoon-
ists’ sketches of characters like Pepe
Le Pew and Bugs Bunny adorn the
gallery’s white walls for the latest
exhibition, “Overture: Looney 'I‘unes
Behind the Scenes.” Included in the
exhibit are the artists’ professional
proﬁles and their personal notes
on the cartoon creations most of us
grew up watching. A screen hangs
directly in the center of the show
space playing episodes of “Looney
Tunes.” I

“Our philosophy is that there are
some museums you never outgrow
and we are the rare museum you can
grow up with,” says Wos.

Like its visitors, the Toon$eum is
growing up. It has already begun ex-
panding to create the Lou Scheimer
Gallery. Due to open on November
12th, the gallery is named after the
famous cartoonist and native Pitts-
burgher. The expansion will give Wos
more space at the museum to share
with Pittsburgh what he believes is

one of the most accessible and popu-
lar art forms.

Photo Antiquities: Museum of
Photographic History

531 East Ohio St., Pittsburgh, Pa.
$8 for students with ID/ $10 for
adults

The Photo Antiquities Museum
stands in stark contrast to the mod-
em buildings on its street. With its
Victorian-style architecture, com-
plete with white lace curtains and
maroon window awnings, it ema-
nates rose—colored nostalgia for
past eras.

Ever since it opened, the museum
has been dedicated to the education,
preservation and history of photog-
raphy. Stepping inside the space’s six
galleries teeming with thousands
of antique photographs and hun-
dreds of cameras — including 457
movie cameras — is awelcome way
to forget about the hustle and bustle
of present—day Pittsburgh. The mu-
seum starts at 1839 and goes up to
present, said the museum’s owner,
Bruce Klein.

Every visitor to the museum re-
ceives a guided tour that includes
a viewing of a replica of the ﬁrst
photograph ever taken in 1827. The
photograph appears as a muddled
and faded gray scene of what one
has to intuit is a view of buildings
from a window. The tour also offers a
chance to use the museum’s antique
serial viewers in order to view the
exquisite photographs in stereo.

The museum’s displays vary
greatly, and “people really have an
opportunity to really see the full
spectrum of photography,” Klein
said proudly.

Its permanent exhibits include a
recreation of a 19th-century photo-
graphic studio and a display of the
only known photographs of Pitts-
burgh’s shanty town during the
Great Depression. For those still in
the Halloween spirit, the museum’s
eerie post-mortem exhibit is still
running.

“I’m telling you, it’s something
for all age groups,” Klein said. I

ALBUM REVIEW

Mac Miller gains fans  
with latest album release

Written By Andrew Greichko

Blue Slide Park
Mac Miller
Rostrum Records
A-

Staying indie clearly did not hurt Mac Mill-
er.

The up—and—coming Squirrel Hill rap-
per’s recently-released Blue Slide Park al-
bum topped the iTunes charts as the No.
1-selling album on Tuesday, coming in above
Coldplay’s My/0 X}/ato. This success gives
further credit to his decision not to join :a
major record label like his former Rostrum
Records partner Wiz Khalifa. Mac has stuck
to his roots, and that’s allowed him to keep
his original style.

Songs like “Of the Soul” allow Mac to
show some love to one of his favorite groups,
De La Soul. One of the pioneering groups
of the ’90s golden age movement in rap,
De La Soul was not afraid to be different,
something Mac constantly advocates in his
own songs. He often credits De La Soul —
along with other ’90s group A Tribe Called
Quest —— for his style.

Part of the reason for Mac Miller’s suc-
cess has been his ability to reach all types of
audiences. Recently, he promised to release
a mix tape if he reached 1,000,000 followers
on Twitter and revealed a new song for every
100,000 new followers. When he reached
his goal, he put out the mix tape I Love Lzﬁ,
Tbamé You.

From his early days as Easy Mac, Miller
has developed a much—improved lyrical ﬂow
-— he now has the ability to rap quickly over

fast beats and use poetic metaphors over
slower tracks. This allows Blue Slide Park
to take the listener in numerous directions.
If you’re looking for party tracks, songs like
“Party on Fifth Ave.,” “Up All Night” and
“Smile Back” are sure to perk up a room.
But other tracks take a more serious turn,
as Mac reﬂects on the path his life has taken
him thus far. _

“Under the Weather,” the seventh track
on the album, might also be the ﬁrst song

.  ai_relative1y—slo'w“beat. Taking the op-
. portunity to think back on his fast-paced

life, Mac’ states that he won’t let the new-
found fame change him. This is a theme of
the album, as many songs — including the
ﬁrst track, “English Lane” — mention Mac’s
dilemma of tryingto be an everyday kid and
still make it big as a rapper.

As the album progresses, Mac seems to
take both sides of the argument. In “English
Lane,” Mac says, “They doubt the money
should’ve changed it / Slide still blue / Why
the world keep tryin’ to paint it? / When life
around you changes / try to keep your same-
ness / Try to keep your brain / maintainin’
through the lameness.”

Only two tracks later, however, Mac
sounds far cockier. On the track “Blue Slide
Park,” Mac says, “I‘m a regular guy with an
irregular life / except I’m a Lamborghini if
it’s racin’ a bike.”

Whether he’s down—to—earth, cocky or
just donning a gray wig as his alter ego,
Cam Rellim —- his name backwards — this
20-year-old rapper is turning into one heck
of a musical artist. I

RECIPE

No—bake dessert quick, tasty

Quick Cookies ’n’ Cream Pie

I am a baking snob. Usually I abhor
anything involving a boxed mix. That said,
sometimes I promise to bring dessert only to
realize that I have no time to heat my oven or
prepare something complicated. So I started
using this recipe when I’m in a pinch.

1 Oreo premade pie crust
2 packages Jell-O Cookies ’n’ Cream in-

stant pudding
2 1/2 cups cold milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
7 Oreos

PourJell—O packets in mixing bowl. Add
milk and whipping cream. Mix (recom-
mended with electric mixer) for 3-4 min-
utes. Stir in six crushed Oreo cookies (for
extra crunch) and pour into Oreo pie crust.
Refrigerate until ﬁrm. I .

- MOVIE REVIEW

Other Olsen sister shines

Written By Katie Azzorcr

 

“Martha Marcy May Marlene”

Starring Elizabeth Olsen, Sarah Paulson,
John Hawkes

Directed by Sean Durkin

Grade: B+

No question, it cannot be easy to get out of
the shadow of two striking, impossibly thin,
trend-setting, multi-million dollar—making,
older twin sisters.

But starring as a psychologically damaged
youngwoman in a ﬁlm riddled with such con-
troversial themes as cults, sexual violence and
paranoia seems like a good startingpoint. Fol-
lowing in the footsteps of recently initiated
it-girl Elle Fanning, Elizabeth Olsen, star of Fox
Searchlight’s “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” is
the next celebrity little sister to strike out on
her own. And, boy, can she play crazy.

Olsen stars as Martha, a confused young
woman trying to adapt to life in her sister’s

home after escaping a commune-like cult
where she was regularly subjected to violence
and assault. R/eturningto the world she left is
a rocky transition, especially with constant
reminders of the terrors of her past coming in
the forms of nightmares and ﬂashbacks.

One of the most remarkable features of
the ﬁlm is the way that it subtly and ﬂuidly
transitions between past and present, memory
and reality. Scenes switch from the present
— Martha at her sister’s house — to the past
— Martha in her life at the commune, where
she was known as Marcy May. These shifts are
startling for the audience, who is not always
aware at what time some moments take place
until a few lines into the scene. At one point
she’s talking and cooking dinner and it seems
that she might be back in the cult — until she
says a cult member’s name and the camera pans
back to her sister, asking who that is. These
scenes are likely just as jarring for Martha, who
seems to be living in both worlds.

While the plot is captivating, the weak
points in the movie are evident. As with any
solid psychological thriller, it leaves the viewer
wondering what exactly just happened, and
much is up for interpretation. But while the
audience gets the feeling that perhaps Martha
is just as confused by the events of her past as
they are, some of the unanswered questions —
like how she got involved in the cult —— turn out
to be more distracting than thought-provoking.
And if you require a sense of closure at the end
of a ﬁlm, prepare to be disappointed.

The strongest area of the movie is the act-
ing. Olsen’s wide eyes and tortured expression
continue to haunt long after the ﬁlm is over,
and the supporting characters remain believ—
able in their respective roles, especially Hawkes
as the shudder-inducing cult leader Patrick and
Paulson as Martha’s yuppie sister, Lucy.

While the story could have used a little more
ﬁne-tuning, “Martha Marcy May Marlene”
does what it sets out to do by providing an
entrancing and haunting story of a woman on
the verge of psychological collapse. Olsen gives
a truly compelling performance that is likely
to leave viewers wondering, “Mary—Kate and
Ashley who?” I

TASSER’S TAKE

Steelers cornerbacl<ll<.e , "

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ” Writer

Jack Lambert once famously said,
“You might as well put skirts on
them.”

The National Football League,
in its ever-vigilant attempt to “p ro-
tect” players, has officially tried to
kill the best rivalry in the sport.

The Steelers-Ravens game had
it all: defense, hits, defense’, bigger
hits and then a comeback drive
at the end. In the Steel City, you
have to respect that, even if the
comeback was orchestrated byjoe
Flacco and not Ben Roethlisberger.
But then there came NFL Commis-

sioner Roger Goodell, throwing -

ﬁnes around in an effort to better
“police” the game. And to think,
there were questions of an 18-
game regular season.

p Three players are set to be ﬁned:
The Ravens’ Ray Lewis and the
Steelers’]ames Harrison and Ryan
Clark — both of whom Goodell
presumably has “Wanted” posters
hanging in his office. What is the
NFL coming to? None of the hits
were ﬁne-warranting — even the
Clark hit, which was, in my opin-
ion, unfairly ﬂagged. These are the
two hardest hitting teams in the
NFL and every time they play, the
entire game looks like the “Ren-

Stay out of he Steelers ivalry

egade” montage they play at Heinz
Field in the fourth quarter.
Goodell claims that he doesn’t
want to “take the toughness out
of the game,” but he is doing ex-
actly that. And what’s worse, the
upsurge in offense this season has
only played right into his hands.
The NFL wants the games to move
toward becoming exciting, high-
ﬂying affairs reminiscent of the
USFL (You guys remember the
New Jersey Generals, right?) and
away from turning into the tooth-

" loosening and bone-rattling hits
of the classic Pittsburgh-Baltimore I

affairs.

It was not that long ago (OK,
maybe it was) when Dick “Night
Train” Lane was clotheslining re-
ceivers (since made illegal) and
Deacon “Secretary of Defense”
Jones was using his “head slap”

‘ technique (also since made ille-

gal) to get to quarterbacks before
he coined the term “sack” (now
borderline illegal). If Goodell had
his way, QBs would be wearing red
j erseys.Jack “The Assassin” Tatum
used to say that many of his hits
“bordered on felonious assault.”
And to think, the old-school tough
guys played both ways and without
facemasks.

gerous. But the message that the
league is “keeping the players’
best interests in mind” was for-
ever marred when the owners tried
to add additional regular season

, games. You can put microphones

in helmets, but you can’t make
them safer?

Better yet, make the helmets
smaller so they cannot be used
as battering rams. Rugby players
don’t wear helmets and there isn’t
any uproar down in New Zealand.
And rugby players are the same size
as most football players, ranging
between 5-foot-11 and 6-foot-8 and
between 190 and 280 pounds.

Throughout its history, the NFL
has continually tried to make the
game safer. It has outlawed spe-
ciﬁc hit after speciﬁc hit to make
the game safer, primarily for of-
fensive players. But it’s starting
to cross a line. The players are big
boys and get paid well enough to
decide if they want to put their
bodies through the rigors of an
NFL game.

Mr. Goodell, we here in Pitts-
burgh (and Baltimore) love dev-
astating defense. If you must
continue to change the NFL to the
National Flag Football League, do
us a favor: Don’t watch the two or
three games every year in which
the Steelers and Ravens face off.
Nobody will complain. hi

CROSS COUNTRY

Perry adjusts quick,
off to a strong start

Jasper Wilson
Staff Writer

The ﬁrst several months of college
are usually spent adjusting to the
new environment. For Morgan Per-
ry, it took no time to feel at home
and establish herself as one of Pitt’s
top runners.

Even before coming to campus,
Perry had started to ﬁnd a home
on the cross-country team with her
newly minted mentor, senior Miya

Johnson.
Since Perry’s ﬁrst visit to Pitt,
Johnson has been a big sister, role

model and mentor to Perry. They
stayed in contact after the visit by
talking to one another on the phone.
During her ofﬁcial visit, Perry said
she felt an immediate connection
tojohnson.

“She could trust me and I could
trust her,” Perry said.

Their relationship has continued
to develop since Perry arrived on
campus. The fact that no one served
as a mentor tojohnson when she en-
tered the program helped motivate
her to be a better mentor to Perry.

“There weren’t many distance
girls when I came into the program,”
Johnson said. “I didn’t have a men-
tor, so I feel it’s kind of my job to
[mentor Morgan] .”

Perry has found success early
and often this year. Coming from a
state championship team at Penns-
bury High School, she has consis-
tently ﬁnished among the top run-
ners from the Pitt team and was ﬁrst
among Pitt runners at the Big East
Championships two weeks ago. This

,,weekend, the freshman will run with

seven other Panthers at the NCAA
Division I Mid-Atlantic Regional
meet. This tournament, depend-
ing on her ﬁnish in comparison to
others across the country, could lead
her to the NCAA National Cham-
pionships, held November 19th in
Louisville, Ky.

Alonzo Webb, Pitt’s cross-coun-
try and track and ﬁeld head coach,
said Perry has been the team’s top
runner at meets because of her abil-
ity.

“It’s unusual for a freshman to
come into a Division I program, be

a leader and compete,” Webb said.
“She wants people to be able to
count on her. She doesn’t want to
let anyone down.”

In her ﬁrst meet of the year, she
led the Panthers with a 14th overall
ﬁnish and a time of 19:56. She fol-
lowed that performance by pacing
the team again with a personal re-
cord of 18:34.68, good fora ﬁfth-
place ﬁnish overall.

Perry ﬁnished 17th overall and
second among her teammates at the
third meet of the year with a time
of 19:50.58, an improvement from
her ﬁrst meet, which was at Schen-
ley Park. In the following race, she
ran a team best 22:43.20, ﬁnishing
18th.

Perry attributed her success to
the pressure to succeed that she
faced in high school, where her
team was a cross-country power-
house. She has gained high-level
experience from being a member
of a state championship team that
went undefeated last year.

“In high school, we always had
the pressure to win,” Perry said. “We
literally had to win every single meet
[to qualify for states] and we did.
It’s a normal thing for me to want
to do well. It’s kind of built-in now
because I dealt with it all throughout
my high school career.”

Two weekends ago at the Big East
Championships, Perry placed ﬁrst
among Pitt runners with a 6K time
of 23:19.50.

“I’m never satisﬁed, to be hon-
est,” Perry said.

Perry has displayed this attribute
in training as well as in races. When
the team splits into groups, Perry
is the only freshman in the fastest
group. Despite her success in high
school, Perry doesn’t have a back-
ground in long-distance running.
When she started running track
in seventh grade, she thought she
was going to be a 200 or 400-me-
ter sprinter. She only started cross-
country in her sophomore year of
high school and even then, she was
hesitant.

“Oh no, that’s too much run-
ning,” Perry said in retrospect.

But she succeeded almost right
away, placing in the top three on

WRESTLING

Panthers bring home
three titles in opener

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

In a weekend full of rivalries in Pittsburgh,
bitter matchups continued on the mats be-
tween the Pitt Panthers’ and the Edinboro
Fighting Scots’ wrestling squads. _

The Panthers squared off with Edinboro,
Lehigh and Buffalo at the Buffalo Open on
Sunday. Both the Panthers and Fighting Scots
had three wrestlers come home with titles on
the weekend. There were also four champi-
onshipmatches pitting wrestlers from Pitt
against wrestlers from Edinboro.

“Going into the ﬁnals, it was great for our
guys to have a couple of matches between our
guys and Edinboro,” assistant coach Matt
Kocher said. “Having those matches at 125
and 133 [pounds] between us and Edinboro
was exciting. It got us pumped to go and
wrestle them later in the season.”

The tournament, which was the ﬁrst of
the season for Pitt, landed seven of the 12
competing Pitt wrestlers spotsin a cham-
pionship match. '

Leading the way for the Panthers was
junior Anthony Zanetta, claiming the title at
125 pounds by a 6-0 decision over Edinboro’s
Kory Mines. Zanetta began the tournament
with a 23-6 technical fall victory in the third
period of his ﬁrst bout, followed by another
23-6 technical fall victory in his second bout.
The bout between Zanetta and Mines could
be an interesting one later in the season, as
Mines is a highly touted redshirt freshman
who won two Ohio state championships in
high school.

“It was nice for us to get a look at Ed-
inboro,” assistant coach Jason Peters said.
“They have an exciting team with a lot of
young guys getting their ﬁrst chance in the
lineup. Normally we don’t see them this early
in the year but I think it was good for us.”

At 133 pounds, the Panthers and Fight-
ing Scots squared off again with a matchup
between Pitt sophomore Shelton Mack and

1 .’a12i;2s,1.17,n3

Edinboro redshirt freshman AJ Schopp.
Schopp got the best of Mack with a 1-0 de-
cision to claim the title. The two are highly
ranked in the Eastern Wrestling League.
Mack took third in the league last year, while
Schopp placed in the top three fourtimes in
Pennsylvania state championships during
high school.

“Shelton did a great job for us,” Peters
said. “Sheltonknows A.J. Schopp, the two
wrestled in high school in the same area.
As long as Shelton,continues to improve he
could very well earn himself his ﬁrst EWL
title.” ,

Redshirt junior Matt Wilps matched up
with Edinboro’s returning All-American
Chris‘Honeycutt in the ﬁnals at 197 pounds.
Honeycutt came away with a 7-2 victory
to claim the title. The tournament marked
Wilps’ return to the lineup after a redshirt
season. Wilps won four bouts on the day,
including two by major decision and one
by fall, aswell as a 2-1 overtime victory over
Joseph Kennedy, a two-time NCAA qualiﬁer
from Lehigh.

“I think that was the best weight at the
tournament,” Kocher said. “Between Hon-
eycutt, Kennedy and Wilps, you have some
quality guys. The match with Honeycutt was
probably the toughest he’s had in awhile.
He was on the defense way too much but
we know that he’s capable of scoring more
points.”

The fourth ﬁnals match between the Pan-
thers and Fighting Scots came at heavy-
weight in a showdown between Pitt senior
Zac Thomusseit and Edinboro redshirt
sophomore Ernest James. Thomusseit de-
feated James by a 3-2 decision to take the
title. The tournament was the ﬁrst time that
Thomusseit competed at heavyweight after
being an NCAA qualiﬁer at both 184 pounds
and 197 pounds. ‘

“He did a really good job wrestling at

heavyweight,” Peters said. “He’s a really

strong guy. He beat a pretty solid guy in
[Ernest] James from Edin oro. Zac has the

/ ability to wear guys down and win. The big

thing with him is the conﬁdence in wrestling
at that weight.” -
Redshirt senior Tyler Nauman was the

- third Panther to win a title with a perfect

4-0 record on the day at 149 pounds. Nau-
man concluded his day with a 10-3 victory
over Kyle Rosser of Lehigh to take the top‘
spot on the podium. Nauman defeated David
Habat of Edinboro in the semiﬁnals by a
6-5 score. Habat is another highly touted
redshirt freshman for Edinborol who was
a four-time Ohio state place-winner in high
school.

“Nauman did well for his ﬁrst time at a
new weight,” Peters said. “It’s a little dif-
ferent when you go up a weight class but
he wrestled pretty well. He maybe faded a
little but in his semi-match, but as you can
see, he can still get wins.”

At 157 pounds, redshirt junior Donnie
Tasser won three bouts on his way to a sec-
ond place ﬁnish. Tasser defeated Edinboro’s
johnny Greisheimer 3-2 in a semiﬁnal match.
Tasser lost by a 12-1 major decision in the
ﬁnals to Eric Hess of Lehigh.

Redshirt sophomore P.]. Tasser came
up just short at 174 pounds, dropping a 3-1
decision in sudden-victory overtime in the
ﬁnals. Tasser won three bouts during the
tournament, including an opening round

”_ fall. Tasser also won a 7-4 decision over Ed-
inboro’s Chris Hrunka.

“I’d say that was the best I’ve
ever seen P.]. wrestle,” Kocher said. “We
were pretty excited afterwards about it.
He stepped up for us and wrestled well. He
scored points and really wrestled to win.”

Senior Andy Vaughan ﬁnished in second
place at 184 pounds after two wins put him in
the ﬁnals against Robert Hamlin of Lehigh.
Hamlin defeated Vaughan 9-3 in the ﬁnals.

. Hamlin is a returning All-American who

ﬁnished as the runner-up at 184 pounds in
the NCAA Championships last year.
“Vaughan has been invaluable to us the
last couple of years,” Kocher said. “You look
at a guy like him as a freshman and you don’t
have many expectations, but every year he’s
found a way to make it into the lineup be-

- cause_he’s a guy that we can trust. He hadn’t

wrestled in practice in something like seven
days, and he still goes out and keeps a tight
decision to an All-American.”

Three freshman Panthers recorded their
ﬁrst collegiate wins, and all three went on
to place in the top eight of their respective

K weight class. .

Both Jordan Shaffer and Ronnie Garb-
insky won their ﬁrst collegiate matches
competing at 141 pounds. Shaffer won his
ﬁrst match by a—15-0 technical fall on his
way to a fourth-place ﬁnish at 141 pounds.
Garbinsky began his day with an 11-1 major
decision in the opening round. He went on
to win three more bouts on his way to a
seventh-place ﬁnish. ‘

'&Nick Bonaccorsi won his ﬁrst match
wrestling the 174-pound weight class on
his way to a ﬁfth-place ﬁnish. “

“I think that the young guys did a really
good job for us,” Peters said. “You can re-
ally lose your focus over the course of the
day at these open tournaments. They did
a really good job and won some matches,
but we even would have liked a few more
wins. We learned some areas that they can
improve and we’re going to. help them work

A through that.”

Next up for the Panthers on the sched-
uleis two weekend dual meets in eastern
Pennsylvania. The Panthers will start with
a matchup with Lehigh on Saturday night.
The Panthers will follow the Lehigh match
with a Sunday showdown at Drexel.

The matchup with Lehigh is espe-

cially interesting because the two teams had
a chance to scout one another at the Buffalo
Open. Lehigh is a perennial power and is
currently ranked No. 5 in the nation, while
Pitt comes in at No. 17 in the NCAA rankings
and No. 15 according to WrestlingReport.
com. Individually, Lehigh has ﬁve wrestlers
ranked in the top eight of their weight class
while Pitt has just one, according to Inter-
Mat.com.

Key matchups to watch against Lehigh are
at the three upper weights. At 184 pounds
Lehigh has Robert Hamlin, currently No. 2
in the nation. If sophomore Max Thomus-
seit is healthy for the Panthers, it would be
a challenging matchup for him.

13

At 197 pounds, Joseph Kennedy and
Matt Wilps look to rematch after Wilps’
victory in Buffalo. Kennedy has been
ranked as high as No. 8 in the nation at
his weight.

At heavyweight, Lehigh has Zach Rey,
the returning National Champion. With
Zac Thomusseit still getting acclimated
to wrestling at heavyweight, the matchup
could be a good gauge of where Thomus-
seit is in his switch to heavyweight.

“Going and wrestling at Lehigh is go-
ing to be a good one,” Peters said. “Going
into their place, we know that we’ll be
wrestling in front of at least 2,000 people
against a good team.” I

her team for her whole high school career.
Simultaneously, she made the shift to longer
distances in track, ﬁrst to the 800-meter and
then the mile.

. Perry’s siblings did not run much growing
up. Her 23-year-old brother Robert ran track
in middle school before moving onto lacrosse
and wrestling in high school, while her twin
sister Lindsay is a cheerleader.

1 Perry’s father, Robert, was a sprinter, and
her uncle and cousin were hurdlers. While
the family has a history of competitive run-
ning, Morgan is the only one who does long
distance. .

“We’ll joke about it. ‘Race me in the sprint,
I’ll race you in long distance,” Perry said.

But more than anything, the runners in
her family are proud and excited for her. They
went to all of her high school meets and have
tried to guide her career.

Her father, especially, has aidedsPerry with
her running. ‘

“When it comes to running, he’s like my
other coach}? Perry said. “We always talk
strategy the night before [a race]. He gives
me pep talks.”

While Perry doesn’t have a preference be-
tween cross-country and track, she noted the
signiﬁcant differences between the two and
speciﬁcally how they affect her mindset dur-
ing the race.

With cross—country, for example, Perry
explained how strategically shehas to fac-
tor in the layout of a course —— something
that doesn’t necessarily come into play on

1 a track.

“On hills, I tend to be a little more passive
because they’re my weak point,” Perry said.
“Off of the hill is where I’ll be aggressive. I’ll
take the hill a bit lighter and then off the top
is when I’ll be more aggressive.”

Track involves strategy, but there isn’t as
much time to think about it because the race
is so much shorter. Perry described cross—.
country as “laid back” and track as “more
intense” and “uptigh .”

“You can getboxed in,” Perry said. ‘‘There’s 1

a pack that you generally want to stay with the
whole time. You don’t want to run in lane four
when you can run in lane one simply because
you’ll be running a longer distance.”

Perry, who is undecided as a major, is en—
rolled in the school of Arts and Sciences.

If there is one thing that Perry has had as
hard time adjusting to, it is life without her
two cats: Drew, a “Halloween cat,” as Perry
described him, and Britney, a tortoiseshell
cat.

“Miss is an understatement,” Perry said, “I
go on Photobucket and look at their picture
It’s a mess.” g t
