WPGH Status Still

Uncertain for Fall

By TOM KUKUCKA.

Pitt News Staff Writer

WPGH Radio, which was forced to cease transmission last April
because of technical difﬁculties, may have trouble resuming broadcast
this fall, according to General Manager Jeff Couch.

WPGH, Pitt’s student-run radio station, left the air last April
because of defects found in the carrier-current system the station uses
for campus broadcast. With the carrier-current, the station’s signal is
transmitted through electrical outlets by lines from the station’s
location in the Student Union to the Towers and the Quad.

Couch is now unsure that the station can resume broadcast in time

for the fall term.

“We .don’t have the funds to go on the air, and we haven’t
negotiated with Student Government for additional money,” Couch
said. “In the next three or four weeks we will work to get the funds.”

WPGH was allocated $5,000 for the coming school year by the
Student Government Board (SGB)'last spring. This constitutes a drop

of $2,000 from the previous year.

“Almost all the organizations had their budgets cut because of the
Pitt Union Program Council,” Couch said. The Program Council was

instituted by the SGB last spring to centralize programming here at
Pitt. SGB allocated some $110,000 to the new agency.

“I think we were lucky to get what we got,” Couch added. “We
received- more money than many other student organizations.”

The problem with the carrier-current arose last spring when some
“leakage” had occurred to the system, causing limited open-air
broadcasting. WPGH does not have an open-air license and, under
FCC regulations, must relay only on -carrier-current broadcasting.

Lobby Names Weapons for Drinking Age Fight  

By TOM_KUKUCKA
l’ttt News Staff \‘\'t'ttct'

A letter-writing campaign and
voter registration drives aimed at
college students are part of a
strategy mapped out last week in
Harrisburg by a newly formed lobby
seeking passage of the 19-year-old
drinking bill, set for House ‘debate
sometime this fall.

The lobby group, named the
“Committee in Support of Senate
Bill 252,” comprises student
representatives across the state.
including Pitt’s Student Govem-
ment Board member Jan Medoff.

“We talked about different

‘strategies to get the bill passed,”

Medoff said yesterday. “What we
are doing is completely different
than what the Pennsylvania Student
Association of State Related
Universities (PSASRU) has done in
the past.”

Pittsburgh's had it’s share of summer events this year, including the Three Rivers Arts Festival and the
Regatta. For many, however, a simple walk through Schenley Park Is enough, to make any summer afternoon en-
joyable. This tather-son team pause for some snapshots at Phipps Conservatory.

Pitt plans to invest $6.5 million for
Schenley Hall renovations, accord-
ing to William H. Markus, acting
vice chancellor for student affairs.
The University expects to raise the
revenuesfor the renovations with a
student union fee to be charged to all
students. A

Only $3.5 million of the funds are
earmarked for actual renovations to
the_ student union. Another $1.5
million are to be spent on an addition
to Schenley, and the last $1.5 million
is for new furnishings.

A Student Union fee to pay for the
improvements would be charged for
a 30-year period. For the first 10
years full-time students would pay
$10 a term, and part-time students
would pay $5 in Student Union fees.

After 10 years fees would -increase
to $15 and $7.50, respectively.
During the third 10-year period
Student Union fees would be $20 a
term for full-time students and $10 a
term for part-time students.

Markus also added that the
Student Union fee could continue in

PSASRU was formed in wake of
last year’s state budget crisis to find
ways of increasing appropriations
for state-related universities. SGB’s
Stan Galanski and David Hesidence
have joined students from Temple,
Penn State‘ and Lincoln Universities
at PSASRU.

According to Medoff, the com-
mittee will concentrate its energy on
passage of the drinking bill. It will
work on legislators: who have
opposed similar bills- in—the past,
legislators who could vote affir-
matively for the bill in the future.

The bill passed the Senate last
June by a vote of 27-21, but a close
vote is expected in the House this
fall. The bill is currently in the
Liquor Control Committee of the
House and is expected to reach
House debate in September.

“Legislators realize that most

‘ people who care about this bill do

perpetuity after the 20-year period
expires, because Schenley could
well be antiquated and need
replacement. '

“There are still a lot of details to
work out, but I think it’s a viable
funding alternative,” said Markus.
“Other students elsewhere are
paying directly for Student Union
facilities. ’ ’

Student Government Board mem-
ber Dave Hesidence said last night
that the improvements to the
Student Union would be worth the
expense of an additional Student
Union fee.

“There is an incredible array of
things that can be put in the
renovated Student Union, and the
fee is the only way to fund them,”
said Hesidence. “I think the level of
fees is worth the improvements, and
students, especially commuters,
would get a lot from their $10.”

The next step in the renovation
plans is the completion of a detailed
design by project architects. Before
these plans are completed, the
Office of Student Affairs wants to
solicit more student input-

not turn out to vote," Medoff said,
“so we have agreed to. have a
state-wide collegian voter-turnout in
September. The Public andGovem-
mental Relations Committee (PGR)
of Student Government has made
this bill one of their priorities.”

Medoff also*said the PGR had
plans to establish information
booths in the Student Union and--the
Towers lobby this fall to teach
students proper procedures for
contacting legislators.

“The basic strategy is to write to
legislators and. get some kind of
student input on the matter,”
Medoff said. “We haye to provide
the means for students to get
involved. This is what the PGR
should do.”

In addition to the letter-writing
campaign and registration drive,
Medoff said the committee resolved

(Continued on Page 3)

 

“We are going to be asking
students once again what they want,
and we will be working with
representative student leaders be-
fore the plan is complete,” Markus
said.

“The design must address the
needs of commuting students,” he
said. “It must allow these students
to recreate, relax, study and eat in an
area that is comfortable and
functional for that purpose.”

Renovation plans for the Student
Union have been considered for
more than six years. In the past the
disinterest the state showed in a
building project for a new Student
Union, and the lack of concensus
within the administration on any
improvement plans for Schenley
slowed the progress of renovations.

Markus still did not believe there
was any dillydallying during the
project. He contended that a slow
and cautious approach to the plans
was necessary to prevent the project
from collapsing after it was begun.

"1 don't think there was any
undue delay.” he said.

Pope Paul VI Funeral Set for Saturday

VATICAN CITY—Nuns in black, peasants from the countryside
and tourists in T-shirts streamed past the body of Pope Paul VI
yesterday at Castel Gandolfo for a ﬁnal glimpse before he is put in a
coffin and taken from the summer papal residence to St. Peter’s
Basilica for burial.

The college of cardinals was meeting to discuss arrangements for
’Saturday’s funeral and the conclave later this month that will choose J

The conclave will be guarded tightly. The cardinals will not emerge
until they have succeeded in electing a new pope, almost certainly to
be one of their number, although technically, it could be any bishop,
priest or even a Catholic layman.

The Vatican announced that the late pope would be sealed in a
coffin this evening before making the 13-mile trip by motorcade from
the summer palace in the Alban hills to St. Peter’s Basilica. ‘

 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

No More Fees

Pitt has finally taken a definite step toward moving the Schenley
Hall improvements further along the road to completion with a
decision by senior administrators to support a $6.5 million
renovation project. This news is not all good news for Pitt students‘
who have heard promises of improvements for more than six years.
The renovation plan has a catch attached-increased fees. p

During the first 10 years “after the levying of the proposed
Student Union Fee, full-time students would pay $10’ a term toward
the debt incurred for renovations. Over the next 20 years, the fee
would increase until it reached a peak at $20. Future students can

’ expect to pay this extra fee forever.

Even though this new fee for students may not be addedto any

, invoices in the near future, thewvervidea of any additional charge to

students for any reason is _repugnant. It seems Pitt administrators
have decided to take the ‘easy route and increase students’ bills

every time they need money.

Perhaps Pitt administrators should look somehwere else for the
funds. Students have been us-ocked with tuition increases for the
past five years and that trend seems likely to continue in the future.
When they must pay these perpetual increases, students can not af-
ford any other additional charges’ (no matter how small they seem

to officials). .

Student Union renovations are a commendable project; any one
who has spent more than five minutes in any of the ratty offices for
student organizations knows it is. However, overburdened studen-
ts are those least able to pay for these renovations.

Pitt can look elsewhere for the necessary money. Perhaps the
General Services Administration could be convinced to purchase

Schenley Hall and complete the improvements.

Administrators

/might also turn to the Golden Panthers and other alumni who are
always so eager to donate for other worthy projects.

Letters to the Editor

Griffith ’s Scintillating Comments ,

Regarding the recent “in-depth
political analysis” of “the horde.of
regular Democratic Party members
who dominate council” and Rodney
B. Griff1th’s sterling crusader Ms.
Michelle Madoff in the July 19 issue
of The Pitt News, we——the College of
Young Democrats at Pitt—beg to
differ.

We are sorry that City Council
meetings tend to cure Mr. Griff1th’s
insomnia, perhaps he would like
fireworks and skyrockets instead.
Ms. Madoff’s statements, while

noisy and awakening, are just
that—ﬁreworks. They are brilliant
from afar while one is watching in the
dark. They also rapidly burn out.

These insomniac curers were the
ones who rebuilt the City of
Pittsburgh and revitalized it with
their Renaissance. The man most
responsible for the Renaissance,
David L. Lawrence, was, by his own
deﬁnition, one of the “horde of
regular Democratic Party mem-
bers” that Mr. Griffith ﬁnds so
distasteful.

We hope that in the future Mr. r

Griffith will look beyond today’s
headlines and into the substance
behind them before he graces us
with another of his scintillating
political articles.

Bob Casey: Pete Flaherty’s Unhideable Curse

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Bob Casey, the Democratic
candidate for Lieut. Governor. loves
sports. Formore than 20 minutes
last week he talked about sports over
the telephone. In that time he retold
his life history as a former basketball
player and coach. Apparently, he
thinks all Pitt students are raving
sports ﬁends. .

Casey has a few other endearing
qualities besides his penchant for
sports. -He is a biology teacher from
Penn Hills who also manages a
Baskin and Robbins ice cream store
in Fox Chapel and is an ardent
anti-abortionist.

None of those graces won the
Lieut. Governor’s nomination for
him. The blessing his parents gave
him at birth—the same name as
Democratic candidate for Governor
and former Auditor General Bob

Casey—probably contributed more
than anything to his win.

The lucky man who has this
surprise winner chained to his
candidacy is former Pittsburgh
Mayor Pete Flaherty. Already
handicapped with the tenure of

Democratic Governor Shapp, who-

may be one of the most unpopular
Governors in Pennsylvania’s his-
tory, Flaherty does not need a
millstone like Casey tied around his
neck, too. '

On the surface, Flaherty’s
approach to his running mate so far
seems to be td keep him hidden. At a
Washington ‘DC. fundraiser last
month Casey was a conspicuous
absentee. He was in Fox Chapel
tending the store.

“I have a family to support,” he
explained when questioned by a
television reporter who visited the
Fox Chapel Baskin Robbins.

Republican candidate for Lieut.

Governor William Scranton III

seems to be part of the same “keep
him hidden” strategy, but other less
conspiratorial reasons might prompt

these two incidents.

The explanation Casey offered for
his absence from the Washington
dinner is at least plausible, and his
presence there was not absolutely
vital. It might be wisest to keep
Casey from the sight of Washington
political who could be frightened to

PERSPECTIVE

contribute after meeting Flaherty’s
surprise running mate.

Declining Scranton’s invitation
might be the smartest move Casey
could make. Any match between the
Yale graduate Scranton and biology
teacher Casey would compare to a
prizefight between a blindfolded
Howard Cosell and Muhammed Ali.
Casey’s rejection of the debate offer
might only be adherence to the
maxim every politician has learned
from the Kennedy-Nixon debate——
never debate unless you have
everything to gain and nothing to
lose.

Casey’s tour of appearances at
local political gatherings in Pennsyl-
vania this month shows Flaherty
does not plan to keep Casey
completely hidden this fall. It would
be foolish for him even to try such a
strategy. The debate invitation
shows Thomburgh plans to try to
discredit the Democratic Lieut.
Governor candidate as part of his
campaign. Hiding Casey would only
add fuel to any criticisms of Casey by

Thornburgh.

The Penn Hills biology teacher
also has some traits the Flaherty
organization can manipulate to their
advantage. He is an immaculate
non-politician, and in the post-
Watergate era any man running for
office without any political back-
ground has‘ appeal to dissatisﬁed
voters. Jimmy Carter won the
Presidency by disclaiming any
attachment to the Washington

. establishment, and this tactic can

easily be adapted to make Casey a
somewhat attractive candidate.

Flaherty still can get only limited
mileage from the presentation of
Casey as a humble commoner, and
no one should expect him to flaunt
Casey like a banner throughout the
campaign. He may try to display his
Lieut. Governor like Nixon displayed
Agnew in 1968. Nixon let Agnew be
seen, but he didn’t let him talk too
much.

This strategy only works if Casey
agrees to be quiet: if Casey refuses to
cooperate, Flaherty is in big trouble.
Casey’s only real platform is
anti-abortion and pro-discipline in
the schools. Anti-abortion is a
touchy topic most mainstream
politicians try to skirt, and Flaherty
probably wants to avoid at all costs
being dragged into the abortion
controversy by his running mate.
However, there is not much Flaherty
can do in the event Casey pushes the
subject.

_ The combination of any pursual of
the anti-abortion issue by Casey and
an incompetence campaign by
Thornburgh could prove disastrous

‘ for F laherty. Most voters might take

one look at Casey and decide he is not

the man they want as second-in-

command of Pennsylvania. With a
man with the magic name of
Scranton as the Republican alter-
native, voters could easily be
persuaded to elect a Thornburgh-
Scranton ticket over a Flaherty-
Casey ticket.

Faced with a problem like this,
there must be quite a few Flaherty
aides who wish they could ﬁnd a big
crate marked, “Democratic Lieut.
Governor, do not open up "

November 2.” It’s a shame they”

couldn’t use the box if they found it.

On Press
Tom Wicker

Tom Wicker’s life story is almost
one of those rags-to-riches epics so
often heard. Although “On Press”
is not an autobiography of the famed
associate editor‘ of The New York
Times, it is a personal view on the
reporter’s life in and reﬂections on
American journalism.

Wicker’s experience began al-
most 30 years ago when he was a cub
reporter for The Sandhill Citizen in
Aberdeen, N.C., covering the
county beat at the courthouse. He
spent eight years on The Winston-
Salem Journal and also had a
two-year hitch in the Navy.

He returned to spend an academic
year at Harvard as a Niemam fellow,
a fellowship awarded yearly to
newsmen for specialized study. He
then became associate editor of The
Nashville Tennessean for one year
and landed a job on the Washington
staff of The New York Times in 1960.

His climb in the Times hierarchy
came quickly, and he was passing
men in the ranks who had been there
for decades. He was on his way to
becoming one of the top reporters for
the most powerful paper in the
world.

“On Press” is both a retrospec-
tive personal history and an open
commentary about the role of the
press in America and the world.
Wicker has developed his own Three
Laws of Journalism and comes up
with some basic predictions about
the future of freedom of the press. It
is almost unfortunate that “On
Press” came out when . it did,
because two major events have
occurred since its publication,
events that could have changed the
focus of the book.

The first event was the June ruling

By the Sﬁﬁiéiiié C'6iir't 'tli'ai't 'p"c‘Sli'cE

have the right to obtain a warrant
and make unannounced searches of
private property-pa_rt_icula.rly

newsrooms—to look for evidence of
a crime.

The second occurrence was the
arrest and jailing of a Times reporter
recently for refusing to disclose
sources and other information he
used in investigative reporting in
New Jersey.

Wicker is a staunch supporter of
freedom of the press and the right of
reporters to legally (through Shield
Laws) protect the identity of sources,
and undoubtedly he is irate about the
two“ recent events and would have
liked to have included them in his
book.

“On Press” is" an informative
book that should be read by every
aspiring Woodward and Bernstein.
However, there are faults with the
book in that the all-mighty and
powerful image portrayed by the
Times is evident, and the conceit
that could be inherited by working
for such a paper seems to plague
Wicker. The celebrated columnist
gives himself or the paper credit for
predicting most of America’s
political reckonings from the Bay of
Pigs to Watergate.

Wicker has much to say about the
role of the press in politics. He
believes that if the press had been
more responsible through the years,
events such as the war in Vietnam,
the Bay of Pigs invasion and political
corruption may not have occurred.
He says that press access to secret
Government documents could allow
coverage that would, create public
outrage at certain Governmental
undertakings.

He cites the success of the Times’ s
publishing of the Pentagon Papers.
He admits that {nae are times when
such documents “should not be
printed, such as the case where
CBS’s Daniel Schorr released the

controversial Pike Report regarding
the CIA.

However, Wicker looks back and
assumes too much. He believes that
certain secret documents A! should
have been published ‘sooner and
adds that he can see no harm .‘ ‘now’ ’
that could -have come from :such
publication.

Undoubtedly-, certain ‘information

loses sensitivity with age, so it is ..

impossible to as'sumef“now” that
the release of classiﬁed material at
the height of a particular controversy
would not have resulted in a threat to
national security.

Along with his stalwart defense of
press freedom comes an even
stronger demand for. press respon-
sibility.

‘ ‘Error. . .can sometimes be a vital
or unavoidable consequence-of the
search for truth, and.- error must
therefore be tolerated, or atleast not
punished by law, lest there be no
search for truth,” he'savs in “On
Press.~” '

Yet,~he adds that public fear of the
press seems more evidentthan ever.

“And some measuresv.aimed at
protecting privacy from‘ being
trampled by the press succeed more
often in shielding police and
Governmental agencies from press
scrutiny. Nevertheless, millions of
Americans, unconvinced even by
Vietnam or Watergate, the CIA and
the FBI, that the,Government can be
duplicitous or repressive, see. a
greater threat to their privacy and
security from the press than from the
Government’s massive police
agencies.”

Wicker concludes that he believes
the American press needs less
inhibition, notmore restraint. Ideas
such as a National Press Council to
scrutinize the press, an Official

Wicker’s Story is Rags-to-Riches Fare
ARTS

Secrets Act to protect Govemmen-
tal documents, or laws limiting
press freedom are ridiculous says
Wicker, who has written the
column, “In the Nation," for
syndication by the Times. sinma
1968.

“At least as. great "a threat, I
believe, comes from‘-the press
itself—in its longing for a" respect-
able place in the established political
and economic order, in its fear of the
reaction that boldness and inde-
pendence will; always evoke. Self-
censorship silences as effectively as
a Government decree, and we have

seen it far more often,” Wicker
concludes. Thus he believes that the
biggest threat to press freedom is
from press sanctions upon itself—-
not from the Government. Consider-
ing recent Government action
mentioned above, how wrong he
may be!

“On Press” is an interesting
inside look at Washington politics
and American journalism. Wicker’s
personal account of his trip to Dallas
with President Kennedy on Novem-
ber 23, 1963, is the highlight of a
book that is educational to
journalists and laymen alike.

Gilliam Cites ‘irreconcilable Differences,’ Quits Wolk Pak

SPORTS

By The Associated Press‘

Quarterback Joe Gilliam, who fell
from football fame into a tangle of
legal and drug problems, cutishort
his comeback yesterday by quitting a
semi-pro team. '

Gilliam left the Pittsburgh Wolf
Pak “due to irreconcilable differ-
ences with the coaching staff,” a
team spokesman said.

“In the past couple of weeks,
there have been differences as to
how the offense was going to be
run,” said R.J. Baker, executive

x

thought it was impossible to function
in the current situation.”

Baker said the former Pittsburgh

Pitt News Staff Writer
OAKMONT, Pa.--What it all
ﬁnally came down to was the fact that
John Mahaffey decided to let
himself win the 60th PGA Cham-
pionship at Oakmont Country Club
this weekend.

Srakocic photos «

Tied with Tom Watson and Jerry-

Pate after four rounds, Mahaffey
won his first of golf’ s major
tournaments in a sudden-death
playoff with a birdie on the second
hole.

Mahaffey, who had won only one
other tournament since joining the
PGA tour in 1971', snapped out of a
victory slump spiced with injuries
and personal problems that lasted
nearly five years.

‘ ‘What I had been trying to do was
make myself win,” said Mahaffey.
“You cannot make yourself win——
you let yourself ‘win.”

Mahaffey trailed Tom Watson,
the tournament leader through the
first three rounds, by seven strokes
as the pair-approached the ﬁfth tee.
With Watson‘ losing two strokes to
par, Mahaffey birdied three of the
next six holes to close ‘the deﬁcit to a
single stroke. i_ ‘

Critical to the comeback was the
10th hole, which had’ Watson‘ lose
two strokes with a double bogey,
while Mahaffey sank a birdie putt of
45 feet.’ The three-stroke swing
changed the entire complexion of the
tournament’s ﬁnal day.

“The round turned around on the
10th hole,” said.Watson." “I drove
into a divet, hit" an iron ‘into another
divet and then two-putted on top of
that. ' ,

“At the beginning o__f- the _fmal
round, I felt that two over for the day
would be "good enough to win,~’_I he
added. “I scored well :enough‘to win
the golf toumamen .”

Pate shot a ﬁnal-‘round 68,» three
under par. but ‘a’ bogey on the;18th
hole is what ultimately gave-
Mahaffey the opportunityto win in
the playoff.

‘ ‘I hit that last putt where I wanted
to hit it, ’ ’ Pate said. ‘ ‘I never‘ saw one

roll out like that before, but that's A

golf, I looked at the leader board at
the fourth hole and saw I was four
under and Tom was 11-under, soil
was just happy to have a chance to
play off.”

Pate, who registered his ﬁrst
professional win at the 1976 United

It was Henne who predicted
before the season began that Gilliam
would move on to a National Football
League team.

“I’m predicting Joe won't ﬁnish
the year with us,” Henne said at the
time.

In ﬂashier days, “Jefferson Street
Joe” was lionized by Steeler fans
when he beat out Terry Bradshaw for
the starting job in the ﬁrst six games
of 1974.

But Gilliam lost his zing and
Bradshaw returned to lead the team

to a Super Bowl victory over

_ Minnesota.

The next year, the 6-2, 190-pound
former Tennessee State player was
placed on waivers.

“He was just no longer effective

and couldn’t function as part of a.

45-man team,” a Steeler spokesman
said yesterday.

Gilliam was claimed by New
Orleans but cut by the Saints.

Captures PGA in Playoff

States Open, _was pleased . that
Mahaffey won, pleased to the extent
of being relieved. To win that U.S.
Open, Pate had to put on a ﬁnal
round surge to catch the third-round
leader, who happened to be John
Mahaffey. The tailspin that followed
the loser was not to end until one
rainy weekend at Oakmont.
“J .D. (Mahaffey) played except-

tional golf, and I was very happy to

- see him win one,”‘said Pate. “After

the Open, J ohnstarted having some
problems, and I couldn’t help feeling
somewhat responsible. ’ ’ \

Both Mahaffey and Pate ex-
pressed the feeling that Watson
could be caught on the ﬁnal day of
the tournament, even though he led
by ﬁve strokes.

“I thought that Tom could be
caught, but I really didn’t believe it
would be by me,” said Mahaffey. ‘ ‘I
started thinking I could win the
tournament at the 10th hole.”

From the 13th hole, the tour-
nament had four different combina-
tions of leaders, with each of the
three golfers holding sole posses-

sion of ﬁrst place during that time.

After 12 holes, Watson was the
leader; after 13 holes, it was a
three-way tie; through 14 and '15,
Mahaffey was in ﬁrst; Pate birdied
the 16th hole to tie Mahaffey;

another Pate". birdie" gave him ‘a
one-stroke cushion after the 17th,
but the putt that almost was made it a
three-way tie.

The entire ﬁeld was spared the
wrath of the treacherous Oakmont
greens, since rain throughout the
week turned the greens soft, making
it possible to go straight for the ﬂag‘
at virtually every hole. Normally, the
Oakmont greens are hard and fast,
making approach shots difficult and
putts treacherous.

As late as Saturday’s third round,
golfers still had not adjusted to the
slower putting surfaces, and many
attempts for birdies and pars fell far
short.

One putt that didn’t fall short was
Mahaffey’s on the second playoff
green.

...John Mahaffey reaps the winner's spoils.

“There have been a lot of
disappointments in my career, but
this win makes up for every one of
them,” said Mahaffey.

TOURNAMENT TIDBITS: Dr. Gil
Morgan recorded the lone ace of the
weekend on the par-three eighth
hole. The club was a one-iron, and
the ball went in on the ﬂy. “I felt I hit
the ball well off the tee, then all of a

Srakocic photo
sudden, I heard the crowd roar, but I
couldn’t see where the ball went,”

said Morgan. Morgan is a licensed P

optomotrist...Only six golferslkn

ﬁnished under par for the tour-
nament...When posed with the
prospect of someone breaking the
course record during the PGA, an
Oakmont course supervisor was
heard to reply, “If someone shoots a
62, I’ll shoot him.”

Pirates Rebound Against Cubs, 9-5

CHICAGO (AP)—John Milner
walloped a grand-slam home run
and Dave Parker collected ﬁve hits,
including a two-run homer and
run-scoring single, to power the
Pittsburgh Pirates to a 9-5 victory
over the Chicago Cubs yesterday.

Milner’s fourth homer of the
season capped a ﬁve-run uprising in
the ﬁfth inning, when the Pirates
chased loser Rick Reuschel, 10-10.
Parker’s two-run blast, his 17th,
came in the three-run third.

Pitcher Don Robinson, 7-5,
opened the Pittsburgh third with a
double andadvanced to third on a
sacriﬁce before being thrown out at
the plate when Manny Sanguillen
hit a high chopper to second. Willie
Stargell followed with a triple to
drive in Sanguillen, then Parker
homered to make it 3-0.

Chicago countered with two runs
in its half of the third. Greg Gross
drove in one run on a force play, and
Bobby Murcer drove in the other
with a double.

But the Pirates’ ﬁve-run burst in
the ﬁfth broke the game open.

Frank Taveras doubled to open
the inning and scored one out later
when Stargell singled. Parker

Former Panther Tom Brzoza,
an 11th-round draft pick of the
Pittsburgh Steelers, was cut by
the NFL team earlier in the
week.

During his college career,
Brzoza earned all-America
honors at two positions, as a
guard for the 1976 national

Steelers Cut Brzoza

Jackie Sherrill last season.

Listed at 6-3 and 225 pounds,
Brzoza had difficulty with the
size and bulk of defensive
lineman in the pro ranks from
the outset of camp. Brzoza never
got the chance to play a down in
the NFL, never leaving the
bench during the Steelers
opening pre-season victory over
the Baltimore Colts, 22-10.

‘ pitch,

followed with a double to chase
Reuschel. Reliever Willie Her-
nandez issued an intentional walk to
Bill Robinson to load the bases for
Milner, who hit an 0-1 pitch into the
rightﬁeld bleachers.

Pittsburgh hiked the lead to 9-2 in
the sixth when Taveras was hit by a
advanced to third on
Sanguillen’s single and scored
when Parker delivered his fourth hit
of the game, a single to right.

Pittsburgh Manager" Chuck Tan-
ner was ejected from the game in
the fourth inning after Milner was

thrown out at the plate attempting 3

to score on a pitch that got away
from Cub_ catcher Dave Rader.
Rader retrieved the ball and threw
to Reuschelfwho covered the plate
and put the tag on Milner. Tanner
argued that Milner was safe.
