Needed: A Course In Decency
_ If Wednesday was any example, students atthis Uni-
. versity needa good sound course in common decency. For
 .no.,.logical reason, many students saw fit to greet Jack Ma-
- honey, better known as the Ranger Rider, with boos, jeers
.‘ -‘and catcallsfl Both he and his sidekick, Dick West, had taken
n time out from "a heavy schedule to visit Pitt and help pub-
~'1icize_next week’s Spring Carnival. ' ' -°
. Mahoney, after taking this treatment for a few min-
 utes,h_ad to admonish the crowd for their lack of social
graces. One can’t help but wish that he had knocked a
 few heads together. Certainly some of the more ignorant
‘ heeded that kind of treatment. ' '
:  Fortunately, Doc Carlson and a few students had the
kindness and graciousness to apologize for the students and
. turn “this affair into "something b neﬁcial. Certainly, if it
- had been left unremedied, both ahoney and West would
have had good reason to leave ‘Pitt with the impression that

Ihave graduated from high school. i ’
’ The Pitt News is all too frequently chastised for be-
_ littling the school’s‘ reputation .in its columns. -We can’t

some students makes,Pitt’s reputation too low to even be-
[ .little. Certainly, that was the case Wednesday. . - — '

Frankly, it seems foolhardy 5
to say you are going to back:
such-and-such a project next
year or that the newspaper ‘will
campaign actively to defeat a"
move to have the Student Union
built off campus. The idea of
setting a ﬁxed program for
handling activities of next year,
' is well-nigh impossible until the

time rolls around and the up-to-
date facts are presented and weighed in every con-
ceivable light. '
We Have a Purpose ‘ 5
We are not going to go all out to publicize every
mixer dance, football rally, or Pitt Players pro-
duction, simply ‘because they are school projects
‘and we are the school newspaper. Nor -A are we
going to sit back and cynically ignore every at-

 

tempt to achieve a better situation for the stu--

dents ‘ and school.

By the same token, thenewspaper will not back

the Greek. societies .because they are such or at-
tack the independent organization for laxness and
apathy. Student Congress will receive praise, con-
dolences, and severe criticism on occasion but we
hope the comment will ﬁt the act. If we laud Men’s
Council, blast WSGA, and revile some of Miss
Rush’s, programs, we will be doing it for a pur-
pose and not as a means of ﬁlling space, getting
a -bigger appropriation, or getting back at some-
body for doing something that hurt us.

In the past, we have printed controversial ma-

terial that aroused the fury‘ and indignation of
some while bringing forth chuckles and nods “of
agreement from others. We have been accused

We have been accused‘of attacking things, people
and organizations unfairly because said objects or

Need a Change? _
Our policy is notgoing to change to any ap-
preciable extent by leaning far to one side or the

other. We are not going to refrain from printing '

facts that may not agree with the views of some '

people and we are notgoing to bend over back-
wards in an attempt to please everyone. We are
not going to be dormant‘, tongue—in—cheek lily-

gilders any more than we are going to blast every- I

thing and everyone in sight just to make things

The purpose of the Pitt News is to serve the
University, the students and the community and
to serve as an outlet for the’ expression of stu-
dent talents._ Although that may sound_ righteous
and puritanical, it is the policy we are going to

stick to come hell, high water, or a Congressional ‘

investigation. If at anytime we fail in this idea,
the students can and will be able to adjust the
matter through letters to the editor and complaints
to the administration. The same goes for faculty
membéfs. " -

Help Wanted - _

On the other hand, if we do a good job, serve
our .purpose, and help students, school, and our-
selves, we hope we_wil1 receive the honor and
recognition we will deserve. Being pure and
righteous again, we hope that people will take

5 enough interest in the News to criticize and praise,

depending on their opinion, through the medium of
the letters to the editor and/ or personal contact.

ODK tone Reveals
‘Man of Year ’Early

One of the University’s “best:

kept secrets” was revealed this
week when workmen prematurely
placed the 1953 Stone of Omicron
Delta Kappa, national leadership
society, in ODK Walk last Tues-

day—the day before Tap Day.

The stone traditionally carries
the name of the outstanding senior
man, and is placed on the walk
between the Cathedral and Heinz

Chapel as soon after Tap Day as
possible. The’ announcement of
the winner is usually one of the

' high points of Tap Day ceremon-
W ies. Since‘ almost ‘everyone saw

the stone in its place before the
ceremonies, the a n n o uncement
came as an anticlimax. ,
Ludwig E. Lippert,7'winner of
this year’s award, .was drilling
his ROTC unit -not _a hundred
yards, from the spot where the
workmen were laying the stone.
According_to Theodore, W. Bid-'
dle, dean of- men, at least two
hundred stludents gathered
around the workmen ‘to watch
them_reveal the big secret. By
the time the error had been dis-
covered, however, it was too’ late
to do anything about it. '
-“The mix—up began when we
couldn’t get the stone cutter to do
the work,” Dean Biddle said.
When he ﬁnally arrived on Tues-
day and completed the work,"‘our
University workmen did_ what
seemed to be the next logical job
—they laid the stone in ODK
walk, even though it was a day
too soon.” '

Tennis is or Better  
Character Builder

By GENE, WEINSTEIN
Aw _,,€ .
The chief justiﬁcation for the immense amount of time
and money spent upon athletics in the United States is that
the athlete, as a result of his experience in competition, be-
comes a more valuable citizen in his other sphere’_s of ac-
tivity. Periodically we are informed as to.the number. of
football players in past years who now subscribe to the Wall
Street Journal, and of the basketball stars who have com-
pleted successful careers in med- __  . _
-icine and allied professions. ,
I am not disputing this asser-
tion _that the athlete transfers his
virtues to other activities. My
point is that football and basket-
ball, the two sports most fre-

acte_,r builders, are actually infer- '

o.

, Important differences in the a ure of the sports result in
tennis’ superiority as a character ‘building inﬂuence.

In basketball and football, for instance, the di ike between the
competing players is obvious. After the game is over, there ‘may be
some slight display of conciliation, but during the contest the in-
evitable attempts to stay within the rules while playing, the game
outside_of them always leads the friction. The only thing preventing
even clipping, in basketball games, is the referees eyesight.

How diiﬁcult is tennis! '

Tennis is ‘called a gentleman’s game, and rightly so. ‘Now the
essence of the successful modern gentleman is to accomplish his ob-

, jectives with a minimum of friction and bad feeling.

_ Thus’ the tennis player“ seldom reveals his true thoughts. ,
When , his _opponent’s ' ball ‘narrowly misses the line, he says,-
in a sorrowful voice, “Too bad, that just missed.” At the end of
the match, unlike the’ gridders and basketball players, the net-
ters show perfect harmony. ' .

Here is some typical conversation:

Loser: “Thank’s for the match.” —

Winner: “I had the breaks.”
-_ _ Then the two stride off the court, often if there is a sizable
audience, with the winner’s arm draped around the defeated player’s\
shoulder. On the bench, the host team has a box of sliced oranges,

.and the two players go to enjoy the fruits of their toil. ‘

Now it is true that some players fail to display proper
‘decorum on the courts. They are the ones who may, if they
become too numerous, ruin the intrinsic‘value of tennis, for they
make the game a rowdy affair, similar to basketball and football.
As I said before, the gentleman is prized in contemporary society
because-he knows how to hide his true feeling. “I am sure that the
old-time ﬁnancier who said “The Public be.Damned” was not
tennis player but a gridder or a hoopster. '

Varsity athletic coaches at
Pitt know Roger McGill very
well and theyfre glad of it.
For the amiable assistant
trainer eats, talks, and keeps
in constant touch with them

as to the injuries and condi-

tion of their squads. . ‘

It is through him and Head
Trainer Howard Waite that the
coaches learn much about their
team’s morale and other things
that they can’t tell out on‘ the
playing ﬁeld.

Of course, this is just part of
Rog’s varied job as a trainer. His
biggest problem is helping Waite
keep Panther athletes playing ball
and not stretched outon a table.

Undergrad Assistant
Rog has been ﬁxing faulty ath-

E letes for the past six years. He is

a former second-baseman on the
Panther baseball squad and dur-
ing his sophomore year at the Uni-
versity, - Publicity Director Frank
Carver asked him to come to
spring training with the football
team as an assistant to Waite.
Rog liked the wo\rk immeditely,
continued it during his undergrad-

.uate days, and after receiving his-

Masters in Education, also began
instructing p h y s i c a 1 education
classes. _ ’ _.

During the summer, Rog acts as

but as he says, “that doesn’t give
me half the work that I have dur-
ing the school term.”
Busy Season

Right now he is in the midst of
his busiest. season with almost all
the varsity sports going on. “But,”
comments Rog, “that doe_sn’t al-
waysmean a lotwof work. Injuries
seem to run in cycles. One. week
we may be deluged and the next
week, we may have nothing more
than a bruised knee.”

Outlook Bleak for Olsonmen
Against Tougher Notre Dame

Comparative times usually are
accurate indications of dual track
meets and if this holds true to-
morrow, -Coach Carl. Olso,n’s‘thin-
clads will have to outdo _them-
selves to whip N otre Dame.

The Panthers, 22 strong, leave
by plane early tomorrow morning
for South Bend, hoping to beat the
Irish for the fourth straight year.

Notre Dame, though, boasts
their strongest team’ of the past

few years and in its victory over.

Missouri lastiweek showed faster
times than the\Panthers in_.many
events. . '

Olson- says, “We have a chance
to win, but they’re tougher than in
the previous years and we haven’t
improved as much as they have.”

Heading the Irish squad is Har-
vey Newquist, who has ‘done 14.4
in the high hurdles thisseason and
‘who ace Panther hurdler Wally
Monahan set his University rec-

with 5-1, then Bendel-Duncan 1-1

and .Mikoleit-Tully. ord of 14.7 against last year. This
