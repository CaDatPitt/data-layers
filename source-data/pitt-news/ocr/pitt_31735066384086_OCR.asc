Vol. 72 No. l8

By CRISTOPBER C. HOEL

Four persons were taken to
the office of district magistrate
Kennedy Smith, and at least one
faces a hearing on drug-related
charges this week, after a
constable assisted by city police
conducted a 2:30 am‘. raid at the
Sigma Chi fraternity house, 4724
Bayard St.. yesterday.

The raid—conducted under
authority of a search warrant-—
may have been connected with a
Federal surveillance of Bayard
Street fraternities, details of
which The Pitt News has learned.

A nine-month-old memoran-
dum written on stationery of U.S.
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare’s Ofﬁce for Civil
Rights to the Drug Enforcement
Administration contains informa-

SGB Co-op
Loses Profits
and Produce

By MAGGIE McKAY

“Some people apparently are

taking advantage of more than the
Student Government food co-op’s
low prices. According to Pat
Gorley, co-op coordinator, produce
thefts caused the co-op to fall short
of food last Thursday, necessitating
$50 in refunds on customer orders.

“Lots of food has been stolen,”
Gorley said. ‘ ‘We came up short on
things we order in specific
quantities, such as apples and
heads of cauliﬂower.

Until this week, co-op customers
bagged their own groceries without
supervision from co-op workers.
Now, customer orders will be
checked by cashiers before a

a ‘timer leaves the Student .Union
istribution center. This proce-

dure, according to Gorley, will slow
up operations and force customers
to wait in longer lines for their
orders to be ﬁlled. Last year, co-op
workers ﬁlled all orders, but
operations were modiﬁed during
spring term to speed up the
collection process. ’
“We didn't run short_ of food

enough orders," Gorley said. “We

tion concerning “the surveillance

Pittsburgh’ ’ has been obtained by
The Pitt News.

“Please be advised we have
proceeded...with the surveil-
lance, ’ ' the memorandum begins.
“We will focus on drug transac-
tions we can ﬁlm.”

A Shadyside address was listed
as the operation’s base, and the
memorandum’s writer included
his opinion that “I think the
neighbors will cooperate with us
as we proceed with this investiga-
tion."

The surveillance apparently
began before the memorandum
was written since the civil rights
office said, “Thus far we have
ﬁlm of the following: Delta Tau
Delta, Zeta Beta Tau, Theta Chi
and Sigma Chi.”

At least two Bayard Street
Greeks have said they believe
they have seen cameras operating
from a nearby building, and one
said his fraternity once had
received advance warning of a
raid that never took place.

Federal ofﬁcials could not be
reached for comment last night.

City police reports indicate at
least two officers arrived at the
Sigma Chi house at 2:30
yesterday morning and assisted a
constable in the transportation of
four persons from the Sigma Chi
to Smith’s East Liberty ofﬁce.
Smith was unavailable for com-
ment last night.

“There will be a hearing during
the week,” Sigma Chi president
John Cica said last night. “I’ve
talked with my lawyer, though,

and he advised me to make no
further comment.

“I will say, however, Cica
added, “that this is the culmina-
tion of all the problems we’re had
in the past with our neighbors.
Apparently they were not satis-
ﬁed with the University system
(of handling complaints concern-
ing fraternity conduct), so they
went to the city system."

Another Sigma Chi brother last
night told a reporter that further
comment would have to come
from the fraternity’s attorney.
though no attorney was listed in
the telephone book under the
name given by the members.

The raid took place after a
Sigma Chi party attended by
brothers and alumni. “It was a
homecoming party," said Cica, a
candidate for homecoming king

and a member of the homecoming
court. . “There were tons of
alumni there, and some of them
were lawyers.”

Residents and fraternities have
a history of confrontation on
Bayard Street that precedes many
of the current combatants.
Neighbors recently hired an
attorney with pooled funds and
are said to be contemplating legal
action, claiming fraternities en-
gage in activities that disturb the
peace.

Fraternity members contend
that many of the neighbors’
actions are sparked by a desire to
increase property values through

Pitt Coffers Emptyirigfg
State Funds Delayed

By MARK MURPHY

Borrowing millions of dollars
monthly and thousands of dollars
daily, the University continues to
ﬁght for its ﬁnancial life while the
State Legislature tries to fund $300
million in non-preferred appropria-
tions, including nearly $62 million
for Pitt.

Although the
State House in
September took E‘;
the necessary:
ﬁrst step for the ‘
University to 
receive its 5
money by over

 

 

whelmingly
approving Pitt’s appropriation, the
legislators have made‘ that act
virtually meaningless by not ﬁnding
a means to raise the needed funds.

Pitt and the three other
state-related universities—Penn
State, Temple and Lincoln-remain
in financial limbo until the
legislature raises the needed dollars
by one of only two ways possible: a
tax increase or a deletion of $300
million of already approved and
funded programs.

The deletion of programs,
considered the less likely of the two
possibilities, would require a
reopening of the budget and
another legislative ﬁght similar to
this summer’s. Also, a law requires

tempted to pay for his food with a $100 bin.'\
The cashier objected, saying the establish-
ment could only take such a large bill from

that a deletion of ;*-i-ograrri; talc»;-.
placc before December or it cannot
happen at all.

A tax increase, the more likely
but certainly less popular alterna-
tive, would require 102 votes in the
House and 24 in the Senate. While
Senate-passage does not appear to
be much of a problem, according to
several Pitt observers, only some 80
House members are now willing to
vote for a tax increase.

It is unlikely that someone in the
House will propose a tax increase
until the number of “yes" votes
totals about 102. Unfortunately for
the four state-related colleges, that
moment is not in the near future.

Until the money is found, Pitt and
the other affqqted institutions must
continue to borrow in Pitt’s case,
35 million by the end of the month.
Both Penn State and Temple have
been borrowing for weeks (Temple
already owes $17.4 million and
Penn State owes $27 million) and all
three are paying over $3,000 in daily
interest payments.

Temple soon will be unable to
meet its weekly payroll, and, if the
deadlock in Harrisburg continues
until December, the school will be
$48 million in debt.

At this moment, Pitt is in trouble,
although in better shape than any of
the other schools. How much longer
this dubious superiority can con-
tinue hinges on the actions of 102
legislators in Harrisburg.

Qosby Fhnenl Today

MADRID, Spain (AP)—Heading
down a final road, the body of
entertainer Bing Crosby will be
ﬂown home to the United States
today.

The crooner died Friday of a heart
attack suffered after a winning
round of golf at a course near
Madrid. He was 73.

His son, Harry, 19, will
accompany his father’s body back to
Los Angeles, where the singer will
be buried Tuesday, U.S. consular
officials said.

To the world Bing Crosby may
have been famous, his son said
when he arrived here Saturday,

   
 
  
 
  
  
  
  

“but to me he was just my father, _a
wonderful father.”

Saturday night, Harry Crosby
visited the body at the Madrid
Institute for Forensic Medicine
where it was taken for an autopsy.
Spanish medical authorities said
that examination showed nothing to
conﬂict with preliminary accounts
that Crosby had died of a massive
heart attack.

Crosby arrived in Madrid
Thursday, planning a couple of days
of golf and hunting in Spain after a
series of performances at the
Palladium in London.

Carter Endorses
Peanut Butter Art

OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP)—Some
say C.G. “Moose” Morehead’s
peanut butter-based painting is a
nutty idea, but they hope it will
spread.

Morehead’s artwork, complete
with autograph from the nation’s
most famous peanut farmer,
President Carter, gained national
recognition last spring. On
Saturday, it was sold at auction for
$10,500 to Jean Ewell, representing
20 bidders who “wanted the
painting to stay in Owensboro so
that the whole community could
profit by it.”

CONSOLIDATION OF
DISCRIMINATION BANS URGED
TO PRESIDENT

WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi-
dent Carter, told by a federal task
force that discrimination in hiring is
still. “a pervasive phenomenon in
American life,” is being urged to
consolidate enforcement of all
federal bans against such discrim-
ination in a single agency.

The task force, making its report
as Carter prepared to send a civil

rights reorganization plan” 

congress, also said equal employ-
ment programs were “hampered by
inadequate leadership at the top,
‘poor management at some of the
major agencies and inadequate
funding.

“It should come as no surprise,
therefore, that discrimination in
employment on the basis of factors
such as race, national origin, sex,
age and handicap is still a pervasive
phenomenon in American life,”
said the task force of the Ofﬁce of
Management and Budget. “,3”, I

Employers now must deal with 18
departments and agencies in
meeting nearly 40 equal employ-
ment opportunity requirements
prescribed by law, executive orders
or regulations, according to a draft
of the recommendations.

If Carter adopts the recommen-
dations, he will make a major start
in consolidating the policing of
hiring discrimination in the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com-
mission.

But for two years, the Labor
Department would continue I05»

prohibits racial and religious
discrimination in hiring, while

Finding off-campus housing can
be a major hassle, but Pitt’s
Off-Campus Housing . Office
(OCHO) is helping’ many students
with the problem.

Results of a survey taken by the
ofﬁce, located on Forbes Avenue
across from David Lawrence Hall,
show that more than two-thirds of
the respondants found information
provided through OCHO to be
up-to—date. accurate and adequate.

 ~a Mary Lou Sossa. coordinator of

OCHO. said the survey indicated
that the services most used by
students were lists of available
housing. maps of the city and
names of realtors.

“We also provide students
(faculty and staff) with literature on
signing leases, information on
tenant's rights. a roommate ﬁle,
literature on furniture rental,
copies of health and building codes
and PAT bus schedules.” Sossa
said.

Listings of more than 2,000
landlords are kept on ﬁle at OCHO,
complete with comments from past
tenants on the quality of the

-gﬁlkvellings.

some things to measure out

The co-op also is providing its
volunteers with a workers’ incen-
tive. Starting today, co-op workers
will be able to purchase produce at a
ﬁve percent markup over the price
the co-op pays its distributors for
food. Non-workers now will have to
pay a 15 percent markup, instead of
the 10 percent rate enforced during
the co-op’s past three weeks of
operation.

“We feel workers are putting a
lot of time in the co-op and. are
getting nothing out of It.
Ultimately, we hope to attract more

risers,” Gorley said.

Of the 17,000 persons OCHO
served last year. 32.2 percent

"72 Years of-Collegiate Jdumaifsm at the University of Pittsburgh"

  The Vacant Seats

The Student Government Board (SGB), well into the second half
of its term of office, is still working below capacity because of two
vacancies created by Ahmie Baum’s resignation and _JoAnn Levin-
son’s ineligibility.

Earlier editorials have discussed SGB’s inability to accomplish
anything substantial. It is easy to conclude that one reason behind
SGB’s inaction is a shortage of personnel.

Chip Hubbard and Josh Baylson have been conducting a series
of interviews with and assigned projects to students interested in
completing the terms of the two positions.

The field of interested candidates has been narrowed to four with
the withdrawal of Kathleen Hallet. This withdrawal, unfor-

.tunately, narrows the field of qualiﬁed candidates. But it is better

that I-Iallet withdrew now instead of resigning later.

One of the four other candiates is Sam Mendecine, who has
demonstrated his zeal for a position on the SGB by telling Hubbard
and Baylson that whether he is chosen or not, he will run for the
SGB come January. Perhaps it would be best for his campaign and
the student interest if Mendicino would wait until January then, in.-
stead of running a campaign from within SGB’s third ﬂoor offices.

The idea of assigning the task of developing an orientation
program for new board members is an excellent one and should

bring to the surface the candidate with the attributes most suited I

for a member of the SGB.

It is hoped the top priority of Hubbard and Baylson is to find
two people who can fill the shoes_of Ahmie Baum and JoAnn
Levirison. Levinson was a promising member who accomplished
less than expected, perhaps because of a conflict that also brought
her departure from school‘ and ineligibility for the board.

The board lost one of its better members when Ahmie Baum
resigned. It would do well by selecting, if possible, another student
of his caliber.

Whatever the choice, the time to make it is now. Much work lies
ahead and the odds of accomplishing anything are better ‘when
there are more students to share the labor. V

Labor Council Adopts Education Resolution

The budget crisis is continuing to
deepen for Pitt students and
workers. In one partial response to
this worsening problem, the Pitt

Professional Union sponsored a ,

resolution before the Allegheny
County Labor Council. The.ACLC is
made up of delegates from all the
AFL-CIO unions in the area, and
represents over , 150,000 workers.
The resolution, which was
co-sponsored by a number of other
progressive unions, notes the
historic interest of the AFL-CIO in
“quality, low-tuition education." It
adds that “higher tuition costs and
job cutbacks have already hit the

students and workers at the state
related universities”/» and warns
that: any failure by the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania to adequat-
ely fund the state related universi-
ties will mean huge tuition
Increases and cutbacks in educa-
tional standards, driving many low
and middle income students out of
school.

The resolution concludes by
urging that the ACLC recommend
“that the state related universities
receive their full funding request
from the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania” and that copies of the
resolution be sent to Governor

Shapp and all Western Pennsyl-i _

vania legislators.

With the warm support of the
leading oﬂicers of the ACLC, the
resolution was unanimously adopt-
ed at the Oct. 6 meeting of the Labor

Council. This step puts the local’

labor movement squarely behind
the battle of Pitt students and
workers to ensure proper funding
for Pitt.

Thanks Expressed For Well-Planned Fesiioors   

’ l.During my tenure as the house

-manager of the Student Union, I

‘have had the great pleasure of

observing many events held
within the Student Union. It has
always been my hope to see a
committee responsible for an
event, do a job reﬂecting they had
done some careful planning before.
rather than on the night of the
event.

Well, I lived long enough to see
it happen twice. Two years ago in
the fall, Lois Martin (Student Union
Reservationist) and I couldn’t
believe we were seeing what'we
saw. because the people‘ respon-
sible actually touched all bases
before the night. Before the night?
Three days befor the night they had
every item ready. They planned a
tight program, and of course, they
had it. If my memory serves me

right, it was Scott .Iulian..and'his
committee.

Believe it or not, it happened
again.

Thursday evening, we had the
Oktoberfest in the ballroom. The
following people are to be singled
out and given special recognition
for the really great job they did to
make it come off as a resounding
success: Susan Barns. Diane
Behers. Marsha Blythe. Debbie
Brezinski. Anne Czyz, Donna
Farey. Joan Giebernick. Lisa
Jones, Sally Keffer, Max Lash,
Daniel Lewis, Donna Malora, Vicki
Mark. Barb Metzger, Tom O’Shea,
Andrea Schrecengast, Steven
Sheffler. Angela Stefanelli. Nancy
Vido and Mark Walley.

Thank you very much for all your
careful planning and hard work.

Please accept a bouquet of spring
violets from me and autumn leaves
from all who attended this
wonderful evening.

American Lifestyle and the Elderly

ness—-—are

By GARY GOVERT

The old man was afraid he was
being a nuisance. Eighty years old
and the patriarch of four genera-

tions, he was visibly embarrassed ~

because his coffee had to be
custom-brewed: it had to be weak,
as if he were too.

But weak is the last word anyone
would use to describe my grand-
father. Tall and straight, with a
handshake stronger than half the
thirty-year-olds I’ve met, he wears
nothing on his face that would
indicate his tiring. Four score years
and eleven sons and daughters
seem to have barely fazed him. His
hair is nearly all there; his step is
firm and his voice clear. The other

things-——his« ulcer; his night-blind-’

like invisible ﬂaws,
hardly tragic, hidden beneath a
mantle of quiet and digniﬁed
power. His mind, as we
condescendingly say, is sharp as a
tack.

So I was surprised to see him
embarrassed at supper the other
night. In fact, it embarrassed me as
well. Without really understanding

it, I knew that in my grandfather’s—

worrying there was an unexpress-
ed, unintended insult to all of us at
the table. ﬂ
Whether it is intended or not,
there is bitter social commentary in
a patriarch’s fear of burdening his
progeny. No one with any pride
wants to be a nuisance, but it seems
to me that American culture does

little -to -make - the - elderly - feelr -

otherwise. There is little in our

lifestyle that would indicate to an 

old widower that he is a respected
and valuable member of society.
Forgotten and lonely “wards of

the state” languishing in nursing 

homes and overcrowded geriatric  "

hospitals; white-haired old women
who day after day watch the streets

of Oakland from the windows of '

their second-ﬂoor walkups, forced
by fear to lock themselves in and
their neighbors out: the symbols-
and the wreckage—of our driving
devotion to youth are all around us.

Old, unfortunately for those who 

ﬁnd themselves in that condition, is  —

not considered beautiful . Vacations
and parties and careers and new
shoes when the styles_ change-

(Continued from Page 4)

those are the things that are
beautiful. The wrinkled old
nuisances we might someday have
to either take in or farm out are a
pain in the butt.

This is insulting because it shows
us up for our materialism and our
youth-oriented chauvinism. It
insults us because it makes us
realize that we have somehow
asserted our ego-centricity to the
point that now nearly everything

little save serve themselves.

grandfather is responsible for the

people now living, yet his position in

if the past is abstract, our
progenitors are not—not even those
farthest removed, the very oldest.
Good and bad, those men and
women dwell in us, and our
so-called authentic selves emerge
under their inﬂuence. To deny
those people, to make second class
citizens of them, is to deny
ourselves.

Of course, my grandfather would
probably think this is a lot of rot. He

Oktoberfest

N etc Atmosphere For Homeeoming’s Beer Fest 

By JOHN FINN
pm News siarrwnm

The atmosphere of Oktoberfest.
with dancing, drinking and dining
replaced the screaming, shouting
and spreeing atmosphere of a beer
festival Thursday in the Student
Union ballroom.

Low lights, Bavarian music, the
aroma of knockwurst and saurkraut
and bright German ornaments
strung from chandelier to chande-
lier transformed the ballroom into a
genuine German atmosphere.

This year’s Oktoberfest was

designed to replace last year’s
catastrophic beer festival. iiccord-
ing to Homecoming Committee
co-chairmen Max Lash and Marsha

:»'--A-'-~i-B3
Homecoming’s traditional beer
festival, rechristened Oktoberfest,
captured a gemutlichkeit atmosphere
with its Bavarian setting In place of
the usual rowdiness,

    

‘ ‘Many beer companies that were
here last year refused to come back
because of last year’s festival,” said
Blythe. “That is why we had to
change the format this year.”

At the Oktoberfest, pitchers of
beer were delivered to each table
upon request, instead of having
people cramming, crushing, and
crowding each other in front of the
taps. In addition, there was one
hour allocated between the two
evening sessions to enable the staff
to clean up the premises.

The event began at 11 a.m. and
ran until midnight. During the
afternoon, two sessions were held
for students under 21 and cola was
served instead of beer.

“There were no more than 15

people at either session,” said’

Lash. He attributed the low
attendence to cola being served
instead of beer.

Those who attended an afternoon
session seemed to enjoy it,
especially the entertainment pro-
vided by Connie's Little German
Band, a group of older men in
German attire who played Bavarian
music all day.

The evening sessions were more
successful. The $3 admission fee
included an Oktoberfest mug and

Pre-Meds Not Limited To 

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Few majors in the University are
as misunderstood as the pre-medi-
cal program. Undergraduates with
visions of scalpels and malpractice
suits dancing through their cran-
iums tend to obtain advice on
courses from upperclassmen and
steer clear of the humanities in their
mad dash for acceptance into med
school. While these routes seem
the best to follow, they ultimately
may prove to- be the student’s
undoing.

According to Dr. Alfred Lansing,
associate dean for pre-med affairs
at Pitt’s School of Medicine, any
student with an eye on medical
school should obtain information
about course requirements as early
as possible.

Lansing estimated he advises
approximately 25 percent of the 300
plus pre-med students.

“I prefer to get them as early as
possible, preferably as freshmen,”
Lansing said. “There’s a lot of
misinformation out, usually

through the grapevine of upper-
classmen, as to what’s good and
what’s bad in courses.”

 

if you’re a premed with a desire to
yield a professional needle, you’d be
wise to check up on the program’s
requirements instead of taking the
usual overdose of bio and chemistry.

Lansing said a typical problem is
the misconception that pre‘-meds
should overload in the sciences.

“So many pre-meds feel they

have to major in biology or
chemistry to please admissions,”
Lansing said. “They can majefziﬁ

It’s not limited to the natural
sciences.”

Lansing’s office is adjunct to the
regular pre-med department. “We
reinforce it,” he said.

While he said the advising ofﬁce
usually helps the -student decide on
what courses to take, 30 years of
teaching have supplied Lansing
with a wealth of workable advice.

“One thing Itell students is n t

classes one term and slack off the
next,” he said. “Keep it evenly
balanced. A reasonable amount of
extracurricular activities also is

encourage students to have expos-

The Jazz Crusaders have been
producing their own style of music
for over 25 years, and if their Friday

John Mayall
A Hard Core Package
ABC

As a blues artist, John Mayall is
underrated because his work
seldom gets enough exposure.
Those who listen to Mayall for the
ﬁrst time will ﬁnd that he has much
talent, both 'in writing songs and
singing them. Instrumentals,
vocals and beat are an integral part
of his music, and they combine to
form a satisfying whole.

“A Hard Core Package,”
Mayall's latest album, will satisfy
those who expect good music from
Mayall and also will impress those
who hear him for the first time.
Although Mayall’s music is basic-
ally blues, mixed occasionally with
jazz, it is varied and refreshing, and
seldom is boring.

Mayall performs blues with a
little bit of funk, and also sings
blues with a Southern flavor. In
addition, he always performs that
basic, hard and heavy blues style
with an individual ﬂavor.

On the new album, “Make Up
Your Mind" and “Rock and Roll
Hobo” display a ﬁne, quick beat,
rich brass and some lively guitar
picking from James Quill Smith.
Mayall’s vocals may not be the best
in the world, but they’re good
enough, and he puts a lot of spirit
into his work.

“Do I Please You” has a nice
rhythm and blues sound and tempo,
and Mayall’ s harmonica contributes
a special Southern ﬂavor.
(Listening to his music, you’d never
know‘Mayall was British.)

Steve Thompson’s lively bass
contributes a little funk, not just
here but in the other selections as
well. “Disconnected Line” also has
a slightly funky sound. and spirited
brasswork by “The Blacksmoke
Horns."

"Ax: Old Sweet i’icture" and
“Goodnight Dreams" both are
'remir.tis,c7e.n_t ofthe Allman Brothers.‘

sax and guitar spared for the
audience's attention.

The mellow “It Happens Ever-
day" used the call and response
technique. an improvised instru-
mental dialogue, to direct attention
to the “conversation" between the
sax and piano.

Two disappointing parts of the
concert were that the Crusaders
surprisingly did not use any brass
instruments and played for little
more than an hour.

The Crusaders started in 1953.
when Felder. Hooper, and Sample
withdrew from Texas Southern
University in favor ofperforming. In
1959, they moved to Los Angeles.
and in 1961, their first album.
“Freedom Sound" was released.

When asked how the group
retains such consistency after 25
years of performing, Hooper said,
“Every time you’re on stage, you
make it feel like it's the first time
You make it feel like you're still
auditioning for ajob. You've got to
work hard, enjoy it and pace
yourself.”

Popwell expressed the group’s~

excellent pieces; good old, knock-
down, drag-out blues. In “An Old
Sweet Picture,” the strong, heavy
beat is combined with a moumful,
drawn-out guitar to produce quality
sound.

“Goodnight Dreams” features
harmonica work by Mayall, going in
and out with the beat to produce a
nice, sleazy sound.

“Now and Then" displays
excellent work on the acoustic
guitar and features exceptional
vocals by Mayall. The song is

philosophy best when he said, “The
music has got to come from your
heart. Total feeling. If it doesn't,
there’s no fun and you know it’s
time to get out."

Hooper also explained the
Crusaders’ style: "Each man here
is good enough to be a soloist. So we
tend to write our music that way and
we've been successful. As a matter
offact, a few ofthe guys either have
performed or are currently prepar-
ing for solo albums of their own."

As for Hooper's own style of play.
he said. “Most people don't think of
the drums as melodic, but I try to
make them just that."

The Jazz Crusaders will perform
next in Atlanta and will tour the
United States until Nov. 1. They
then will return to the recording
studio to make another record.

“We really enjoyed playing here
tonight,” Hooper concluded. _ “Of
the 100 concerts we perform a year,
about 60 percent are for college
audiences. But for some reason, we
always seem to pass up Pittsburgh
on our tours. But we’ll be back

S001] .

Mayall Releases N ew Album

“Arizona Bound” and “Give Me
a Chance” both are decent rhythm
and blues selections; both contain
Mayall’s sharp guitar‘ picking and
his ever-present harmonica. Mayall
uses the harmonica extensively but
discreetly-——it doesn't overshadow
everything else.

John Mayall fans will ﬁnd “A
Hard Core Package” as good a work
as any Mayall has put out. If you
like blues, you'll like Mayall. If
you’d like to get into blues, Mayall
is a good place to start.

 

Sanford‘ and Townsend, new-
comers to the music scene, will
make their first appearance in
Pittsburgh Oct. 21 at the Stanley
Theater.

Both musicians began their
careers by writing. Their work was
recorded by notables such as
Loggins and Messina, Nigel Olsson
and Bernie Taupin.

This year, Sanford and Townsend

  

teamed; they began their concert
tour last summer. They now have a
hit single on the charts, “Smoke
From A Distant Fire,” which
reveals their rhythm and blues
background.

Appearing with Sanford &
Townsend will be Firefall, also a
newcomer to the music world. This
group possesses a mellow style, as
its commercial hits have indicated.

Jazz Seminar Slated At Pitt

A weekend ofjazz is in store for
Pitt when the University brings in
several acclaimed jazz artists for
three days of seminars and
performance. Musicians Kenny
Clarke and Dexter Gordon will
highlight the events, beginning this
Thursday.

Dexter Gordon (above) and Woody
Shaw (right) are two jazz performers
appearing at Pitt this coming
weekend. i ‘

The seminar will open with a
lecture by George Butler, vice-
president of Columbia Records,
who will discuss “The History and
Evolution of the Music Industry.”
Friday night's seminar will feature
Bobbie and Bobby Fulton and the
Gospel Chords.

Saturday night’s concert at
Carnegie Hall will include perform-
ers Kenny Clarke (percussion),
Dexter Gordon (sax). Abraham
Laboriel (bass), Woody Shaw

(brass), Mike Longo (piano), Terry
Pollard (vibes) and seminar director
Nathan Davis (reeds).

Clarke, who has resided in Paris,

is a Pittsburgh native. He teamed
with Francy Boaland during the
1960's and helped start the beebop
era with Charlie Parker, Dizzy
Gillespie, and Thelonius Monk.

Clarke has appeared in several of
American and French ﬁlms such as
“Paris Blues.” He will receive the
University of Pittsburgh’s Jazz
Seminar Award for his worldwide
contributions to jazz.

Gordon is coming from Denmark
to appear at Pitt. He rose in
popularity during the 1940's and
with the Billy Eckstine Band and
Wardell Grey. Gordon, an
acclaimed saxophonist, has won
several awards.

of “Fraternity Row’s” grim look at
college life in the 50’s is most
provocative.

“Fraternity Row” is a disturbing
and effective drama that examines
the rituals, relationships, peer
pressure, singlemindedness and
unsavory aspects of a college
fraternity on the campus of a posh
Eastern University in 1954.

Written by a University of
Southern California (USC) graduate
student, “Fraternity Row” pre§-

Shy and naive boys and girls are

that degrades them, in the name of
brotherhood, through humiliation

result is contempt and hatred

A question that arises when
viewing the ﬁlm is whether this
brutal mocking and hazing exists in
college fraternities today.

Of course, it is dangerous to

generalize about any movie 

depicts a select social group.

However, “Fraternity Row”
depicts clannish, secretive and
highly emotional rituals of so-called
fraternal loyalty that seem to cause
more harm than good to individuals
caught in the Greek system.

A particularly impressive feature
of this low-budget ﬁlm, shot
entirely in and around a typical
college fraternity house, is the high

and intense cast, all of whom are
relative newcomers to the screen.

By LYNNE L. Ml;YI:RS

This weekend's concert with
Andre Previn and the Pittsburgh

centur_v war horses—Mussorgsky's
"Pictures at an Exhibition'.' as
orchestrated by Maurice Ravel.
and Brahms‘ Piano Concerto No. 2
in B flat majgr. The performances
were unusually boring and
uneventful. "

Mussorgsky originally conceived
his "Pictures at an Exhibition" as a
l0-movement piano suite. inspired

. by some Victor Hartmann paintings

‘:!“’seen at an exhibition in 1874. Two

ofthe movements are connected by
a “walking promenade" theme. a
march that introduces the piece
and serves as "tour guide" music.

The moods of these Hartmann
paintings range from the impish
and fun-loving “Children Playing

in the Garden of the Tuileries."

and.“Ballct of Chickens in Their
Shell" to the dark and grandiose
“Gnomes." “Catacombs" and the
“The Great Gate of Kiev."

In 192?. the great French
composer and orchestrator Maurice
Ravel colorfully arranged this
Mussorgsky piano suite for sym-

Gregory Harrison is the idealistic
pledge leader, a dreamy “Gatsby”
ﬁgure who wants to make his class
special and different from the
current group of rude and malicious
members. They go out of their way
to rake him over the fraternity coals.

Opposing both Fox and Harrison
is a loud-mouthed and insecure
fraternity bully who throws his
weight and position around, driving
the shy pledges into the dirt with
verbal berating and physical
humiliation (shining shoes, pouring
garbage on heads, cutting hair:
etc.)

Scott Newman, (Paul's son) is
effective in his portrayal of this
rotten apple.

One of the movie’s warmer
moments include the new pledges’

Beatlemania is grabbing Amer-
ican youth with another wave of
Beatle music, Beatle junk and more
bucks for promoters. The show on
Broadway, “Beatlemania.” is but
an effort to depict this needed
revival. Pittsburgh received one
more in a series of promotion items
to get young people to wake up and
listen to the Beatles again.

I don't know how these promot-
ers reach their conclusions- Most
youths are very much into music
today and it is my opinion that
Beatles Top Ten hits have never
stopped being played. In this
regard they stand with the late
Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan.

The Stanley Theater presented
“A History of the Beatles” this
past weekend. The ﬁlm itselfis put
together loosel_y with Beatle music
providing the thread holding the
production intact. Edward Racklen
was in charge of the graphics
included at the beginning of the
film. accompanying such hits as
“Paperback Writer." "Help!" “A
Hard Day's Night." “Yellow
Submarine“ and “Blackbird."

These graphics included special
effects. cartoon ﬁgures and news

pictures. representing a collage of
current happenings during the
Beatle years. They were ﬂashy.
funny and politically hard-hitting.

An interview with Paul pointed
out what was in the minds of the
Beatles. particularly his and John's
as they collaborated on songs
(“Love Me Do”) as far back as
l9S7: “We werejrying to do and go
above what's been done before
because what's been done before
isn't necessarily the answer."

The basis of the film. the history
of the Beatles. began with Paul's
quote. Scenes from the famous
appearances on the Ed Sullivan
Show in February. I964 flashed on
the screen and I began reliving my
Beatle experiences. l’ll never
forget those three shows.

An interview with Ed Sullivan
quoted Sullivan as saying that he
and his wife were at the London
airport in October. l9t'i3 when they
witnessed a fanatical reception
given the group. That night he
booked the group for three shows
in February of 196.4. at a fee of
$l0.()O0.

As I witnessed the rabid fans
going hysterical over the ebullience
of Paul. the bluesy voice of John.
the antics of Ringo and the high

“ooohs” of Paul and George
during ‘Twist and Shout” and “I
Wanna Hold Your Hand.’’ I
recalled the days of my own form of
Beatlemania.

I owned buttons. combs. wallets
and. most sacred of all. those
Beatle bubble gum card pictures. I
would give my life for possession of
the card with an excerpt from
Paul’s diary stating how he loved
“American telly (TV).” Every
female alive knew that Paul was the
cutest Beatle. We’d fantasize
about being his wife. kissing him or
having him sing just for us.

One of the strangest things from
the Ed Sullivan tapes was the fans.
The females panned on camera
gave brilliant. hysterical perfor-
mances. Two crewcut males just
sat. there surrounded by all this
noise. They didn’t even look like
they were enjoying the show.

Next came excerpts from a late
l9S0's film from a Liverpool club
where the “Quarrymen." as the
group called itself. performed.
There was no mistaking Paul and
John belting out rock ‘n’ roll.

What appeared to be a British-
made and produced television show
was then shown. It was called
“Around the Beatles." The Beatles

performed “Long Tall Sally” and a
medley of 1964 hits while playing on
the stage of a Shakespearean
replicated theater.

Fans demanded the Beatles be
knighted by the Queen. This just
wasn’t done. so instead they were
invested with the title of “Mem-
bers of the British Empire.”
An interview with the group then
demonstrated each individual’s
sense of humor as the Beatles
practically tore apart the interview-
er with quips and snappy answers
to stupid questions.

A large part of the film spent
time on an American made
television show surrounding the
roncert the Beatles gave at Shea
Stadium in 1965. We see them
coming through New York City on
their way to a helicopter ride across
town to the stadium. We see them
shaggier. hair growing longer and
dressing in the day's fashion.
Nehru jackets.

We were privileclged to watch
them dress backstage. to rehearse
and to add relevant comments on
music in today's world. One of the
group spoke about the popularity of
the group's music: "What we
picked up. we put down. Don’t try

Of course, all employees at the National Security
Agaaay have ’c"é'ftaii‘i things in common: they are
civilian employees of the Department of Defense;
they .are engaged in technical projects vital to our
nation's communications security or a foreign
intelligence production mission; and they all enjoy
the benefits that accompany Federal employment.
However. the differences between our career
opportunities are just as interesting as their
similarities. For example.. .

TO THE ELECTRONIC ENGINEER (BS/MS): An NSA
career means delving intaunique projects which can

design. develop, test arid manage contracts on
communications, recording, and information storage
devices and systems whose capacities. and speeds
are still considered futuristic in most quarters.

TO THE COMPUTER SCIENTIST (BS/ MS): It means
applying his or her knowledge in a wide range of
sub-disciplines such as systems design, systems pro-
gramming, operating systems, computer applications

analysis. and retrieval systems.

TO THE MATHEMA'I'ICIAN (MS): A career means

Playhouse

Comedy

The Pitsburgh Playhouse
Theater Company opened a comical
yet stirring presentation of “The
Hot L Baltimore" Friday evening.

Written by Lanford Wilson. the
play centers around 17 hours in the
lives of the residents. employees

and visitors of Hotel Baltimore-‘V

The play’s cast is excellent. In
the role of Mrs. Bellotti. Harriet
Maier gives a pathetic touch to a
poor woman whose overly-shy son
is being evicted from the hotel. As
the play continues. she trudges
back and forth through the lobby
carrying her son's possessions in a
brown box. Mrs. Bellotti conveys
the message of poverty and
loneliness.

Jane Jasulaitis and Josie Tutsie
play two older. established prosti-
tutes. April and Suzy. Suzy is a
lightheaded woman who presents
the humorous. busy side of
prostitution. But April gives a
melancholy and bittersweet slant to

this lonely. tragic profession.‘§i,‘5°..

In Jackie. (Helena Ruoti). the
playwright combines both humor
and tragedy to present his most
realistic and stirring character.

“The Hot L Baltimore" is a great
success. The cast. director and
crew work through the play's
humorous effects to create a subtle
but moving tragedy.

A Look At

Greek Lifettay

(Continued from Page 13)

Warm and lighthearted moments
aside, “Fraternity Row” deals
vividly with the emotional hell the
pledges are subjected to by the
active members. The ﬁlm’s ﬁnal
message, via a hard-hitting climatic
scene, is a hands down judgement
on fraternity life and the strange
structure of the fraternal organiza-
iion.

For in “Fraternity Row,” the
rights of individuals take a backseat

to the goals and objectives of th{’
larger organization, no matter how“‘ .

silly or brutal they may be. With
tradition and ritual as the written
law, constructive change is the
enemy of the system.

Panthersﬂold On to 34-17 Win 7 

ByJIMPANE
Pm News Staff writer

The Panthers wouldn't let it
happen again. They simply refused
to let their passion for fumbling
away the football ruin another
perfectly good Saturday.

As a result, Pitt recovered from
three drive-stopping fumbles and
treated a Pitt Stadium Homecoming
crowd of 45,397 to a 34-17 sinking of
Navy.

“We didn’t want to see another
nightmare,” Panther split end
Gordon Jones said after the contest,
referring to the fumble-fests
against Notre Dame and Florida
that led to a loss and a tie for Pitt.

The nightmare never came,‘ but
the Panthers would have been
dreaming if they had any pre-game
thoughts of walking all over the
Midshipmen. On the contrary, the
Middies kept themselves in the
game with time-consuming drives
and a tumover-free performance
that resulted in a much closer
contest than the score would
indicate.

In fact, the outcome was not
settled until midway through the
fourth quarter, when the Panthers
ﬁnally called on the Joneses next
door to, expand on what was then a
10-point lead. From the Pitt 49-yard
line, Cavanaugh threw, a 34-yard
pass to Gordon Jones that
Superman might have missed,
setting up a 16-yard touchdown
sprint by Ray “Rooster” Jones that
was enough to extend Pitt’s record
to 4-1-1.

But the fact that three lost
Panther fumbles—all inside the
Navy 35—prevented them from
turning the game into a rout was
reason enough to upset Pitt head
coach Jackie Sherrill.

“We have to get rid of all the
fumbles,” he said. “They are
killing any sustained drives we
have.”

Sherrill’s concern is well noted,
especially after viewing Navy’s
ability to hold on to the football. The
Midshipmen kept possession of the
ball 13 minutes longer than Pitt did,
ran 19 more offensive plays and
racked up 312 total yards in the
toughest test for the Panther
defense to date—somethings that
didn’t surprise Sherrill at all.

“Navy always is a very well-
coached and disciplined team that
makes the best of the type of player
they have,” Sherrill said. “Their
offense is excellent at getting the
three, four and ﬁve yardsgper pop
and controlling the ball on long
drives.”

Not to be outdone, the Panther
offense responded with 532 total
yards of its own. Quarterback Matt
Cavanaugh, in his ﬁrst performance
ever against the Middies, hit on
nine of 12 passes for 179 yards and
controlled a balanced offensive
attack that featured the running of
Elliot Walker and Fred Jacobs and
the eye-opening catches of Gordon
Jones.

Walker darted for 169 yards and
two scores while Jacobs picked up
109 yards and a touchdown of his
own. Jones, in one of the best
performances of his career, snag-
ged six passes for a whopping 142
yards.

On the defensive side, junior
Desmond Robinson filled the
linebacking vacancy left by injured
Al Chesley and led the squad with
17 tackles.

Despite the countless stellar
performances on the Pitt squad, the
unlikeliest player was awarded the
game ball. Junior center Walt
Brown, acclaimed by Sherrill as the
best deep snapper in the country,
took over for the ailing Tom Brzoza
and handled a pressure situation
well enough to attract team
recognition. '

“Our biggest concern was what

the loss of Brzoza would mean,”"

Sherrill said after the game. “Walt
Brown came off the bench to do an
excellent job at center and received
a game ball. He’s been behind the
scenes for three years now, but he
came in and responded well in a
crucial situation.” i

As close as some of the ﬁnal team’ I

stats were, it looked at the outset as
if the game would turn into a
runaway for the Panthers, who
scored on their ﬁrst two possess-
ions. After Navy punted when its
initial drive stalled, Pitt took over
and marched 74 yards downﬁeld for
the ﬁrst score of the day. On the
Panthers’ ﬁfth play of the game,
Cavanaugh pitched left to Jacobs,
who danced 13 yards for six points.

   

Navy’s Ed Reid (25) makes a valiant effort to block a Mark
Shubert extra point in Saturday's 34-17 win at Pitt

Panther fumble, however, set up an
Middie score with 12 seconds left in

collegiate touchdown and settled
the score, 34-17.

But a fact of football life is that

«'hat’s desired often is not easily

there’s going to be some people left

can be on the field at one time.
Process of elimination means about
80 players have to resign them:
selves to the fact that they're going
to be spending some time on the
bench.

Sometimes the wait is long.
Sometimes it’s short. Sometimes

an in-between category. as it did

Panther linebacker Desmond Robinson (54) got_his first chance to start Satur-
day and reponded with a total of 17 tackles, the most by any player in the Pitt-

Navy contest.

The wait. for Robinson. was well
worth it.

“It's always_a good feeling to

game. “It's something I’ve been
waiting for since I came here.”

After his impressive showing.
the chance to start again probably
won’t be as long in coming for the

Robinson impressed two important
people who have reason to be
impressed with such a strong
performance-—Pitt head coach
Jackie Sherrill and linebacker
coach Foge Fazio.

“Desmond showed he could
play." Sherrill said. “For a kid not

“We were very pleased with the

“Al's position is a very. very

“Whoever plays there has to be

it. He ﬁnally had gotten his chance

Jones Tape-rs Midshipmen

By JIM LEWIS
Pit! News Staff Writer

Gordon Jones’s ﬁngers weren’t
taped Saturday.

He had them taped before last
season— when he required three
stitches between his pinky and ring
ﬁnger on his left hand, and the two
ﬁngers had to be held together.
And last season, when he required

taped ﬁngers. he was a bit erratic.

But in the ﬁnal two games of
Pitt’s championship year, Jones rid
himself of the tape, and since has
had the upper hand against
defenders, including an acrobatic
34-yard fourth-quarter reception
from quarterback Matt Cavanaugh
that single-handedly broke Navy
for a 34-17 ﬁnal score.

“I don’t think I‘d have made that
catch last year,” Jones said. “I
don’t think any one can catch a ball
with only two ﬁngers. It was very
uncomfortable trying to catch with
my ﬁngers taped up.”

Jones’s astounding reception
turned an uncomfortable Panther

scorer. did not make the trip
because of “disciplinary
measures." Silva had been
benched for one match in last

weekend's Army Invitational for
the same reason.

“Some players have a tendency
not to follow our system. and
they must be forced to do so."
e.\plained Coach Rivera. “If you
let certain people do as they please.
you get a bI‘CZll(do\\'n of team

fine performances by Mere Mike

Schotield led the Panthers with
six goals. and Feller had 15 saves.
but Arm_v broke a 10-10 tie with two
goals in the final 1:15 to put a
damper on a fine all-around
performance by Pitt. Mere scored
three goals and Barry Ford chipped
in one to round out the Panther
scoring.

"We showed a lot of character
a_-_g;ainst Army." said Rivera. “We
ran our plays well; our defense was
tough. and Steve (Feller) was just
excellent. Barry (Ford) got robbed
on a ct auple ofhis shots or we might

"I was especially glad to get this

Midshipmen into a runaway..
Cavanaugh. trying to muster a
offensive attaack, took the snap
from center Walt Brown on his own
49-yard line, spotted Jones cruising
down the left sideline and archeda
long, towering pass.

Jones. well-covered by a Middie
defensive back, reached out,
tapped the ball up in the air,
stumbled, fell, and clutched the
pass on his way to the turf, setting
up Ray “Rooster” Jones’s I6-yard
touchdown run to put the contest
away.

“I didn’t know if I’d catch it,”
Jones admitted, “but I didn’t let it
go. I was ﬁghting for it and
sticking right with it.”

It was a difﬁcult catch—one of
six Jones snagged on the after-
noon, good for 142 yards his best
performance this season, but not
the most memorable grab of his
career.

“It was a difficult catch, but I
don’t know how - much more
difﬁcult it was compared to others
I’ve made.” Jones stated. “My
touchdow catch against West
Virginia two years ago (Pitt lost,
17-14. in Morgantown) was probably
the toughest catch Ive made.”

— Jones’ six reeeption—his busiest
day to date—is part of Pitt head
coach Jae kie Sherrill’s game plan
of “getting the ball to our skilled
people,” something the Panthers
weren’t doing in previous outings.

"I wasn’t really pleased with
punt returning,” Jones said,
“Because I didn’t see as much
action as I hoped. I always had
conﬁdence in myself and always
had conﬁdence going into a game,
it's just that hopefully I would see
the ball-more."_ _ W

“We didn’t want to see another
nightmare like last week,” he
claimed. “We were disappointed
we didn’t win. but we just had to
forget about that and look forward
to this game.

“I myselfthink I can have a
better game than this one this

year.’ ’

5 Booters Offensive, 8-0

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt New Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team has a
new-found offense this season. as’
the Panthers’ 8-0 bombardment of
Youngstown State last Friday at
Pitt Stadium would indicate.

“Last year we couldn't have
blown out the Little Sisters of the
Poor." Pitt head Coach Leo Bemis
said after the contest. “This year.
we have more people who are
potential scorers—the opposition
can't watch for one or two players
on our team."

The Panthers broke a 3-0 Pitt
halftime advantage wide open.
tallying five goals in the second
half—three within a 1:40 span.
Craig Connolly. a mid-fullback
converted to halfback this season.
led everyone with four goals in
beating a not-so-bad club.

“It was a pretty good game—
they didn’t have too bad a team as
far as having guys who can play
soccer." Bemis explained. “It was
just that our guys decided they
were going to play soccer——they
were really up."

That Pitt really was up was
evident early in the match. as
Connolly scored his first goal with
only 31 seconds gone in the contest.

a Pitt record. The unexpectedly
quick tally was so sudden that the
shock sent the time clock off four
minutes.

Goals by Tim Pearson and
Connolly set the stage for a truly
ominous second-half scoring blast.

Mark Nigh started things with an
early goal. followed by Connolly.
Marty Moyer. Connolly and Jerry
Buirge. to stow the game away and
put Pitt (4-3-l) one step Close!‘ to an
NCAA playoff sport.

"We’re beginning to arrive at a
certain style." Bemis stated.
“We're a big team. not exception-
ally fast. but we're doin things
better as a team. We have a
different system this season— we
put guys in where they work the
best in that system. But we still
have to see if our new-found
competency in scoring can work
against top-flight clubs."

Pitt has out-scored weak minor
competition. 28-1. (by beating St.
Vincent 8-0. Gannon 7-l. Carnegie
Mellon. 5-0. and Youngstown. 8-0)
and will get that top-flight
competition test Wednesday when
it hosts the Edinboro Fighting
Scots. who are looking for
post-season action themselves.

“They beat us 2-] last year. and

are capable of playing good
soccer." Bemis said. It was not one
of better games.

Pitt will have to play one of its
better games against the Scots and
Grove City. the Panthers’ Friday
night opponent. if it hopes to
improve enough to challenge Penn
State and West Virginia-—— two
teams who are of much higher
caliber than the Little Sisters nfthe
P001‘.

Ohio Is No Ball As 1 

Women Spikers Fall

By JOHNFINN

The Pantherette volleyball team
continued to ﬁnd top caliber
competition difficult to beat,
dropping two matches to Ohio State
and Ball State Saturday. It was the

Pantherettes’ third consecutive loss.

and Pitt’s sixth loss in seven games.

Against Ohio State in the day’s
first match, Pitt played as well as it
has all season, according to head
coach Mike Hebert.

“The Ohio State match was an
exciting match,” said Hebert, “and
it was the best we have played this
season.”

Pitt lost the best of ﬁve match to
Ohio State 3-1. After dropping the
ﬁrst game 13-15, the Pantherettes
stormed back to win the second
game 15-7. In the third game
several mental lapses and mistakes
haunted Pitt in a 15-2 rout, and in
the ﬁnal game Ohio State won a
hard fought 20-18 decision.

In the next set, the Pantherettes
were overtnatched by Ball State 3-0.
“Ball State is the best women’s
volleyball team I have seen,” said
Hebert. ‘ ‘Their serve reception was

OnlyTampax tampons have

an applicator that IS flushable
and biodegradable

ﬂawless and their offense was
awesome.”

While Hebert sees weekly
improvement in his young team, he
continues to be beseiged by
questions such as “What’s
wrong?” “Why aren't you
winning?” “Weren’t you supposed
to win it all this year?”

Hebert takes the questions and
criticism in stride. “I am not one to
make excuses,” he said, “but there

are reasons for our record this yea1.I if

“To begin with, we are playing a
much tougher schedule,” he said.
“Already this season, we have
faced some of the best teams in the
country.”

In addition, Hebert learned last
week that Pitt lost its number one
setter, Maria Perez, for the balance
of the season. Perez had knee
surgery for torn cartilage, and her
presence has left a gap in Pitt’s
offense.

‘ ‘Not only was she an outstanding
setter,” said Hebert, “but she was
also a real team leader. She was our
quarterback, and losing her is as
damaging as when a football team
loses its quarterback.”

Hebert said he does not like to
dwell on the past; instead, he
believes in taking action. This week
he has considered morning work-
outs in addition to afternoon
practices.

“We have been improving each
week,” Hebert said, “and we must
continue in that direction.” A

Hebert noted the fine play of
freshman Ingrid Mueller and junior
Pat Montgomery, who has worked
her "way back into the starting
line-up. Hebert also complimented
Cindy Frye for her exceptional play
in the back row.



“Our big test will come .7
weekend at the Delaware Invita-
tional,” said Hebert. “It will be a
tournament with the best teams
from the East.”

Despite Pitt’s 9-7 record, Hebert
said he believes a good showing this
weekend really will help Pitt receive
an invitation to the Eastern
regionals.

Marc Wilson was so tense he
couldn't eat breakfast a week ago.
but he made up for it Saturday by
eating Colorado State’s lunch.

Wilson is a 6 foot 5 inch
sophomore at Brigham Young
University and all he was expected
to do this weekend was replace
Gifford Nielsen, the nation’s
leading passer. who suffered a
knee injury against Oregon State
last week and was lost for the
season.

Nielsen had thrown six touch-
19.-wn passes against Utah State
and ﬁve against New Mexico
earlier in the season. but Wilson
eclipsed those efforts by tossing for
seven scores, a Western Athletic
Conference record. as BYU de-
molished previously unbeaten Col-
orado State. 63-17.

“I was so nervous I couldn’t eat
breakfast last Sunday. but I was
OK the rest of the week.” Wilson
said. “Giff talked to me three
times and helped calm me .down. I
knew we'd be okay after the first
touchdown drive when we went the
length of the ﬁeld.”

Wilson ﬁnished with 15 comple-
tions in 25 attempts for 332 yards.

“Us performance included TD
pitches of 37. eight and 33 yards to
Tod Thompson. 25 and 22 to
George Harris. 28 to Todd
Christensen and 12 to John
VanDerWouden before he left the
game midway through the third
period.

“We spread out our offense a
little more for this game and I felt
Marc did a remarkable job." said
Coach LaVell Edwards. “We have
built our whole season around the
_gnal of winning the WAC cham-
rphmslmipiatnd up tothis point I think"
we can do it."

Wilson’s performance oversha-
dowed a weekend in which No.
l-ranked Michigan. ﬁfth-rated Ohio
State and No. 6 Southern California
posted easy triumphs while the rest
of the Top Ten had their problems.

Mighty Michigan swamped No.
14 Wisconsin. 56-0. as quarterback
Rich Leach passed for two
touchdowns and scored one while
second-string tailback Roosevelt
Smith tallied twice.

The gag in the Midwest was that
Wisconsin. which brought a 5-0

connected from 33. 67 and 25 yards
out. The 67-yarder equaled the
major college record set by
Erxleben earlier in the year.

Meanwhile, Earl Campbell thun-
dered for 189 yards on 34 carries,
giving him a career total of 3.386.
That broke Chris Gilbert's Texas
record as well as the Southwest
Conference mark held by Dickey
Morton of Arkansas.

Kansas quarterback Brian Beth-
ke came off the bench and
engineered two second-half scoring
drives as the Jayhawks rallied to tie
Colorado. Alabama quarterback
Jeff Rutledge scored twice and
fired a 30-yard TD pass to Ozzie
Newsome as the Crimson Tide
turned back Tennessee.

Ohio State quarterback Rod
Gerald ran for two TDs to lead the
Buckeyes past Iowa. which man-
aged just 69 yards on the ground.
“Our defense again was very. very.
very good; we really throttled
them." said Coach Woody Hayes.

Penn State built a 31-10 lead over
Syracuse as Steve Geise scored
twice and then held off a late rally
as the losers‘ Bill Hurley completed
22 of 36 passes for a school record
329 yards.

Paterno missed the game to be
with his 11-year-old son. David. who
was hospitalized in “serious but
stable condition" after suffering a
fractured skull in a fall from a
trampoline at school.

“The coach is vital during the
week before the game. but on game
day it's up the players and we knew
what we had to do.” said nose
guard Randy Sidler.
