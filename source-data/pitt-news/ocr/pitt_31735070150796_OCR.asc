THE PITT NE

The Daily Student Newspaper of the University of Pittsburgh

ASL Club panel
discusses issues
of deafness

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

Several years ago when she was in high school,
Lisa Ripper and her younger brother decided
to hit the McDonald’s drive—thru for dinner.
At the time, McDonald’s drive—thrus were a
simple system consisting of a menu, a speaker
and a microphone. The Ripper siblings placed
their order but because they are both hearing
impaired, they couldn’t make out what the
voice coming over the speaker was saying.

“So we were like ‘OK, OK, yeah.’”

When the Rippers went to pick up their or-
der at the window, itwas heftier than expected.

“We drove away with $25 worth of Mc-
Donald’s. Double everything. I amvery thank-
ful now that they [have your order] on the
screen, so you can check what you want before
it comes to you.”

The way technological advancements, such
as McDonald’s improved drive—thru order
boards, have bettered the lives of deaf and
hearing—impaired individuals was just one of
several topics discussed at the American Sign
Language Club’s 16th Annual Deaf/Hearing
Panel last night in the O’Hara Student Center
Ballroom.

Over the course of an hour and a half,
six panelists answered questions from the
2oo—member audience and addressed subjects
ranging from cochlear implants to challenges
facing the deaf community. The discussion was
part of Pitt American Sign Language Club’s ef-
fortto spread awareness about the experience
of living with deafness.

“We want to show the struggles they go
through, the crazy things that happen in their
lives and how they can succeed like anyone
else,” club technical manager Rob Dibble said.

With four of the six on-stage panel mem-
bers being either deaf or hearing impaired,
they all signed their words or had their words
signed by a certiﬁed interpreter. They also
stood in front of a large projection of white text

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett recog-
nized Pitt Dean of Students Kathy Hum-
phrey as one of ﬁve top African-American
leaders in the state during a ceremony
commemorating the 150th anniversary
of the Emancipation Proclamation last
Wednesday. ‘.
During the ceremony at the State Mu-
seum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg, Cor-
bett lauded the accomplishments of “ev—
eryday heroes” such as Dean Humphrey,
Cassandra Vaughn, Denise Williams, Dr.
Deborah Witt and Ron Jackson — all of

whom have achieved notablesuccesses
in their respective fields.

“Generations to come will see the im-
pact they have on others and their com-
munity because of the dedication and op-
timism they share with all of us,”»Corbett
said in a press release from his office.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an
executive order issued by President Abra-
ham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863,, that freed
all enslaved people within the rebelling
Confederate states during the Civil War.

Humphrey, along with the four other
honorees, were selected by members of
the Governor’s Advisory Commission
on African-American Affairs. Her fellow

honorees were Vaughn, director of com-
munity-based services at Big Brothers Big
Sisters of the Capital Region; Williams, e'x~
ecutive director at Mount Ararat Commu-
nity Activity Center Inc. in East Liberty;
Witt, an assistant professor at Thomas
Jefferson University Hospital in Phila-
delphia, and Jackson, dean of students at
the Community College of Philadelphia.
Karen Stokes, executive director and
chairwoman of the commission, said it’s
important to honor African-American
community leaders as well as historical
figures such as Martin Luther Kingjr.

Before arriving at the University,
she served as vice president of
student development at St. Louis
University for six years.

For Humphrey, the recogni-
tion is a testament to the stu-
dents she interacts with on a
day—to-day basis.

“I have the privilege and
honor of working with some of

and I consider it a blessing to
serve them,” she said in an email.
“While I appreciate the honor, it
almost seems unfair to receive
an award for doing something

on a black screen to provide closed captioning.
Only panelists Amy Ahearn, the mother of two
deaf children, and Dr. Kim Mathos, a child
and adolescent psychiatrist, do not live with
a hearing impairment.

Debate arose among the panelists over the
topic of cochlear implants, electronic devices
surgically implanted into the ear of a deaf in-
dividual to improve hearing. Many deaf indi-
viduals can’t hear because certain hair cells in
the ear that are necessary to pick up vibrations
are damaged. , _ ’

Cochlear implants bypass the need for these
hairs by stimulating the cochlear nerves of the
ear using electrical impulses. This method
allows deaf individuals to hear, though at a
lesser capacity than those born with hearing.
Cochlear implants contain an external device
that includes a microphone, a speech proces-
sor and a transmitter and an internal device
that includes a receiver and electrodes..An
individual can remove the external portion
for activities such as swimming, but the device
will not work without all components being
attached.

The panelists explained that while part of
the deaf community views cochlear implants as
a positive advancement, a separate part of the
community sees choosing the implant surgery
as an unnecessary risk or an attempt to turn
deaf children into something they simply are
not — hearing.

“That’s a touchy subject,” panelist Kenny
DeHaan, who is deaf and an adjunct profes-
sor for sign language classes at Pitt, said of
cochlear implants. “The deaf community does
vary on this. It’s a melting pot. Does it divide it,
maybe. If you have a strong deaf person, yes,
they would be against it.”

Ripper, a graduate student in Pitt’s School
of Public Health whose brother has a cochlear
implant, spoke to the success her sibling has
found using the device:

“I’ve seen them work,” she said. “It’s amaz-
ing technology if you think about it.”

Panelist Devin Rosentreter, a deaf indi-
vidual and professional counselor for other
deaf people, argued that parents who choose
to implant a cochlear device in their deaf child
should also ensure that the child learns sign
language. He highlighted the fact that if a deaf

  

rlat (rib) of the American Sign Language Club Luv Purohit 1 Senior Staff

child wants to swim or participate in some
other sporting activities, he or she will need to
take out the cochlear device. If the child doesn’t
have an alternate form of interacting without

the cochlear implant, then he or she will be cut 

off from communication with others.

“If [the cochlear implant] fails, you ‘ll

  hen  bile-i line.

a backup,» ftosentreter said of sign language

instruction.  V.  :_..
In addition to cochlear implants, the panel "

also discussed the Way other technological
advancements have already impacted the deaf
community and will continue to do so in the
future.

“It can be a double—edged sword at times,”
DeHaan said. . ~

On the one side, he said Internet access
has allowed peopleto communicate more eas-
ily through tools such as Facebook, but tech-
nological advancement also includes genetic
engineering. ’

“Are we going to try and get rid of the deaf?”
DeHaan asked. “It’s a little scary.”

Some members of the deaf community see
their deafness as a quality that makes them
unique.

“Within the deaf community, acceptance
is valued,” Ahearn said. V

The panelists also returned repeatedly
throughout their presentation to the barriers
deaf individuals face in aworld where hearing
is the norm.

“Hearing people still oppress us even to-
day. It’s not oﬂicially done,” panelist William
“Bam” Coleman III, a deaf individual and sign
language interpreter, said. ’

As an example of this oppression, he point-
ed to a lack of sign language interpreters in
health care settings and a lack of legislation
to remove such barriers.

“When will it stop? After I’m dead?” Cole-
man asked. “I’ll have to rise from the dead to
ﬁnd out. I don’t know.”

Ahearn expressed hope in regard to the
continuation of breaking down barriers for
deaf individuals.

“I think about my two deaf kids. I want to
see those services improve. I don’t want my
kids to be repeating all the same experiences
you’ve had. I want things to be better for them,”
Ahearn said. I

POINT OF CLAlRE~lTY

 show “Pretty Little Liars”

isn’t just a guilty pleasure

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

Chances are, you have one: some-
thing you and your friends make
fun of. You’re cracking jokes just
like the rest of them, but deep
down you know you love this
thing. You are too ashamed to
admit it. Whether it’s a book,
movie, video game, secret hobby
or televisionshow, everyone has

In 2612, we saw the ﬁnales of
some serious television guilty
pleasures. “Desperate House-
wives” ended last spring after
an eight-year run, and “Gossip
Girl” concluded right before
Christmas. Both of these shows
had the necessary ingredients
for a solid guilty pleasure. There
were secrets, mysterious deaths,
betrayals, some humor thrown
in the mix and an attractive cast

But there’s one show in par-
ticular for which “guilty plea-
sure” might be the wrong ter-
minology. A better term would
be “skeleton in the closet,” espe-
cially based on the show’s theme.
That show would be none other
than ABC Family’s “Pretty Little
Liars.”

The show is an insanely suc-
cessful addition to ABC Family’s

First, a majority of the show’s premise
involves the main characters’ fears of an
anonymous force blackmailing through
text messages, videos, pictures or with
other information that the antagonist
threatens will go viral. Computer ﬁles,
emails and casual hacking are standard.
The girls’ enemy, “A,” is essentially the
most powerful cyberbully anyone could
ever fathom.

And in addition to the tried~and—true
elements of suspense that the show’s
writers utilize to keep viewers guessing,
producers of “Pretty Little Liars”inveSted
signiﬁcantly in incorporating a method
of audience engagement unavailable to
greats such as Hitchcock and Nabokov in
their times. Outside the writers’ premises
for the show, “Pretty Little Liars” has a
huge social media presence in terms of its
weekly viewership. Every week, one of the

Upon ﬁrst glance, it’s nothing more
than the guilty pleasure everyone looks

this show has achieved more than just
being a teen favorite: The older, more
culturally aware can enjoy it too.

Pitt looks to lock up

double—bye Witha

victory again’ st Blue"Demons 

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

When the Pitt men’s basketball team
takes on DePaul Saturday in Chicago,
it will do so with the possibility of
securing a double—bye at Madison
Square Garden next week, a perk of
ﬁnishing as one of the top four teams
in the regular-season conference
standings.

No. 20 Pitt (23-7, 11-6 Big East)
registered its largest Big East victory
the last time these teams played at the
Petersen Events Center injanuary,
defeatingthe Blue Demons 93-55 for
a 38-point blowout victory. Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon credited a solid
rebounding effort as the key to such
a comprehensive performance.

“We played them earlier in the
year, and the rebounding was key,
and so it’s gotta be key again,” Dixon
said. “We’re preparingfor the presses,
getting ready for those and the dif-
ferent types of presses that they run.

We know that they’re a team of
streaks, ateam of runs. They want to
force you to do things you’re not used
to doing, and we need to play the way
we play and play our pace and take the
right shot at the right time and make
good decisions,” he said.

The Panthers need not only to
make good decisions to prevent the‘
Blue Demons (11-19, 2-25 Big East)
from putting together a dangerous

streak, they also need to stay focused
on the defensive end bto prevent play-
ers from having big scoring nights.

“We obviously gotta keep their
guys under control, they have guys

who concern us in [Cleveland] Melvin
and [Brandon] Young, but they have
other guys who can get going,” Dixon
said. “They’re ateam that can score in
bunches and we have to understand
that and not give up those runs.”

Pitt saw a great deal of success
against DePaul’s two leading scorers
the ﬁrst time around, holding Young
to 13 points on 3-for-16 shooting and
Melvin to seven points on 3-for-14
ﬁeld goals. Young enters Sau1rd‘ay’s
bout averaging 16.6 points per game
while Melvin brings his 16.5 points
and 7.1 rebounds per game to the
table.

On Pitt’s offensive end in the ﬁrst
contest, junior Trey Zeigler played
arguably his best game of the season
with a game—high 18 points — alsohis

highest scoring output thus farat Pitt.
But lately Zeigler’s level of scoring
production has declined drastically,
as he’s averaged just2.4 points in the
nine games since Pitt played DePaul
onjan. 26.

Zeiglerhopes to getback on track
and re-establish his scoring touch
heading into the postseason.

“They play a high-paced game,
so there will be a lot of opportuni-
ties for me in games like that when
the game’s back-and-forth, and the
tempo’s faster,” Zeigler said. “Hope-
ﬁilly I can get myselfback on.”

Zeigler also expects DePaul to
change up its game plan after the
Panthers mauled the Blue Demons
in the ﬁrst go-around.

“I’m sure they’ll throw a different
look atus. When you have agame like
we had, we played really well, they’re
going to try and take something
away,” Zeigler said.

In addition to Zeigler, redshirt

freshman guard Durand Johnson

also looks forward to lg‘ ' gwhat  

he can do against DePaul. Inithe ﬁrst
matchup, Johnson shot 3-7 from the
ﬁeld and ended with an unsightly ﬁve

“I deﬁnitely want to get back at
DePaul. I had a rough gamewith tum-
overs againstthem and look forward
to playing against them Saturday and
showing that I’rn not the same player
I used to be,”]ohnson said. .

A signiﬁcant question mark for
Pitt’s matchup Saturday revolves

around its biggest player, Steven. ,

Adams. Adams sprained an ankle

in practice leading up to Sunday’_s _

victory over Villanova, a victory the
freshman was forced to sit out of.
“Steve went through 5-on-0 stuff
yesterday and today,” Dixon said.
“Based on what we’ve seen from
Steve, I think he’ll be able to play.”

The ﬁnal Big East Breakdown ever is
upon you, Pitt News reader. It’s been
awild ride tracking Pitt’s ﬁnal season
in the Big East, and the experience
hasn’t disappointed.

But that’s another topic for anoth-
er time. Today, this men’s basketball
breakdown brings to you its ﬁnal in-

‘ stallment of chaos with the Big East’s

darling of the moment, Georgetown,
losing on the road to Villanova on
Wednesday. Pittsburgh, defeated
two consecutive times two weeks
ago, now seems poised to lock up a
double—bye for next week’s Big East
tournament and a halfway decent
seed in the NCAA Tournament. Here
are the rankings as they stand for
Pitt basketball’s ﬁnal regular-season

beginning 

week in the Big East.

1. No. 8 Louisville (25-5, 13-4
Big East)

The team that began this break-
down as the conference’s top team
is on top once again, in an almost
poetic sort of way. Rick Pitino’s squad
is playing its-best basketball at the
best possible time, having won nine
of its last 10 games. The sort of streak
Louisville rides now is what propelled
it into a Final Four berth last season.

2. No. 5 Georgetown (23—5, 13-4)

No team had been hotterthan the
Hoyas of late, who had won 11 games
in a row —— a streak that spanned

' nearly two calendar months. But

Georgetown paid a visit to the Wells
Fargo Center in Philadelphia, and the
winning streak ended.

he performs on the national stage.

10 a.m. — Women’s tennis againstcornell
and Rutgers

P The women’s tennis team will host two home
matches this weekend: Cornell at 10 a.m. Satur-
day and Rutgers at 2 p.m. Sunday. The Panthers
are going to have their work cut out for them
against these top-notch teams. Pitt’s record is
4-5 overall, and the players need to play their
best tennis if they hope to improve that record.

Standing in the way will be Cornell (5-0) and
Rutgers (5-2). The team will rely on the strong
doubles team of sophomore sisters Amanda
and Molly Wickman.

All day — Wrestling, Eastern Wrestling
League Championship
The Pitt wrestling team will travel to Edin-

boro, Pa., on Saturday to compete in the Eastern '

Wrestling League Championship. A win here
qualiﬁes an individual to proceed to the NCAA
Wrestling Championships. There are only 23
available spots for competitors to advance in

V _ the EWL conference. Redshirt sophomore Tyler

Wilps hopes to gain one of these spots after
ﬁnishing as arunner-up last year. I

<iFROM PAGE 6

M HOOPS

Even if Adams doesn’t play, Dixon remains
conﬁdent that Pitt will ﬁnd ways to plug up
the holes left by his absence. Redshirt junior

Talib Zanna excelled at just that Sunday, as
Pitt needed every one of his 14 points and 19
rebounds in an overtime victory. A
“We’ve had different situations where we’ve
had guys out, and you gotta put guys at spots
that they’ve played in practice  I like the ver-

titarisi  

3. No. 15 Marquette (22-7, 13-4) 1
The Big East’s quietest, yet arguably most

successful, team just keeps on keeping on. Mar- A
quette recently picked up bigwins against Syra- 5

cuse and Notre Dame that primed the Golden
Eagles to lock up a double-bye at Madison
Square Garden. _ '

4. No. 24 Notre Dame (23-7, 11-6) .

The Fighting Irish not only lost a golden
chance to separate themselves from the pack
of teams with 11 conference wins, but also to
rise closer to the top of the conference when
they lost to Marquette on Saturday. Notre Dame

faces another huge matchup this Saturday at .

Louisville. .

5. No. 20 Pittsburgh (23-7, 11-6)

Pitt lost two straight games against Notre
Dame and Marquette that could have pushed
it to the top of the conference if won. But the
Panthers rebounded with three straight vic-
tories and will conclude Saturday against De-
Paul in pursuit of a double-bye in the Big East
tournament.

6. No. 17 Syracuse (23-7, u-6)

’ Little is going right for the Orange recently,

1 with the only positive coming in a 21-point

win over hapless DePaul on Wednesday.’ That
success came after Syracuse dropped three in
a row to fall from the conference’s lead down
into a tie for fourth place.

7. Villanova (19-12, 10-8) A

The Wildcats continue to play as inconsis-
tently as ever, losing to Seton Hall one week but
turning around to beat Georgetown thenext
as they did Wednesday in their ﬁnal game of
conference play. ,

8. Providence (17-12, 9-8) ,

Conferencevleading scorer Bryce Cotton,
with 20 points per game, has led the Friars
from the bottom of the Big East into, well, the
middle. But it’s better than where Providence
was at the end ofjanuary.

9. Connecticut-(20-10, 8-9)

Although the Huskies can’t participate
in any postseason competition, Kevin O1lie’s

satility we have,” Dixon added. I

squad has competed with the best of the con-
ference, highlighted in an upset victory over
Syracuse on Feb. 13. But the 2013 Big East
season had its downs for UConn, its current
three-game losing streak included. The third
loss came against South Florida

10. Cincinnati (20-10, 8-9)

The Bearcats have won just two of their
last eight games, a stretch which has played a
heavy role in Cincy’s fall from a conference-title
contender to ateam close to the basement. Cin-
cinnati spent a great deal of time near the top
of the conference but fell off in February when
its schedule became markedly more difficult.
It has yet to recover.

11. St.]ohn’s (16-13, 8-9)

St.John’s has become avictim of misfortune:
Head coach Steve Lavin suspended leading
scorer Diltngelo Harrison (17.8 points per game)
for the remainder of the season, and the Red
Storm played theirway out of contention fora
single-bye at MSG and need to win four games
to get to the Big East ﬁnal.

12. South Florida (12-17, 3-14)

USFis ﬁnishing strong, attaining its highest
breakdown ranking of the season. The Bulls
currently ride a two-game winning streak,
which is about as good as it gets when it comes
to college basketball in Tampa this season.

13. Seton Hall (12-17, 3-14)

The Pirates ended their nine-game losing
streak before the end of February, picking up

an upset win over Villanova, but then went 5

right back to losingwhen they dropped their
next game to Providence. ;

14. Rutgers (13-15, 4-13) _

Rutgers has won just once in almost tw
months, going 1-11 in its last 12 games. The
Scarlet Knights started out at .500 in Big East
play but fell off the wagon in the worst way
possible. ‘ A ’

15. DePaul (11-19, 2-15)

It’s quite a shame that a city renowned for
being a “basketball town” like Chicago has to
suffer through the continuous abysmal sea-
sons that DePaul delivers. The Blue Demons
end their season against the team that handed
them theirworst loss of the season — Pitt. The
‘Panthers beat DePaul 93-55 in latejanuary. I
