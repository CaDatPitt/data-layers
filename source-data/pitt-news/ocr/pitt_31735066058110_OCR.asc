News Assistant

Three Pitt fraternities were put on
social probation and must perform com-
munity service for their role in an
alleged sexual assault at the Phi Gamma
Delta (FIJI) house last month.

Leon Haley, vice chancellor for stu-
dent and public affairs, has put FIJI on
probation for the remainder of the acad-
emic year and Sigma Chi and Delta Tau
Delta were given a probation sentence
for the rest of the academic term.

“The fraternities are prohibited from
having any social events with their
chapter,” said IFC President Brian
Rifkin.

Haley issued the terms of the punish-
ment in a “report to the University of
Pittsburgh community on the alleged
sexual assault incident and underage
drinking.”

FIJI President Chris Nolan said the
fraternity will appeal.

“We feel the entire investigation has
been mishandled from the beginning.
We will appeal to the fullest extent pos-

sible so that justice will prevail and our
reputation will be restored,” Nolan said.

Haley said the report was issued in
response to recommendations and sug-
gestions from the Interfraternity
Council concerning the incident.

“The IFC acknowledged that there
was sexual activity in the bathroom,”
Haley said.

“There is ample reason to believe that
a number of men may have been active
or passive participants in this activity,
[and] the witnesses to the alleged

An interactive teleconference, broadcast
at the University of Pittsburgh as well as at
more than 230 sites across the United

The conference was sponsored by the

Pitt requests 6% increase for 1996 fiscal budget

By Joe Furber
For The Pitt News

A 6 percent increase in
commonwealth appropria-
tions was requested in the
University of Pittsburgh
Operating Budget request for
fiscal 1996. I

“In the past couple of
years Pitt has not received
the increase that we have
asked for, but very few orga-
nizations have, because the
past couple years, probably
the past four or five years
have been really difficult
times as far as the budget
goes for the common-
wealth,” said Kevin Evanto
of Pitt’s governmental rela-
tions office.

“Things have been very,
very tight,” Evanto said.
“We think the budget presen-
tation we have submitted is
very reasonable.”

The budget and the request
are based on three assump-
tions: a stable university-
wide enrollment, a tuition
increase not to exceed 3.5
percent and an increase in

and in addition, the appropri-
ations increases have not
been as great as the rate of
inflation growth in the
General Fund Budget.

salaries, technologically

current libraries. These
funds are also used for main-
tenance to keep facilities

safe and in compliance with
new regulations and man-
dates.

Between the l990 and
1994 fiscal years the General
Fund Budget increased 27.5
percent, while inflation rose
18.6 percent. Funding for
higher education did
increase 8 percent, but Pitt’s
appropriation only grew 6.2
percent. This shows that
inflation affects the actual
amount of funds Pitt
receives.

As a part of the Master
Space Plan and the new cap-
ital budgeting system, long-
range plans have been
designed to enhance stu-
dents’ educational opportu-
nities. These expansions
have been included in the
request submitted to the
commonwealth.

interactive “computer

all five of Pitt’s campuses
and allowing a greater vari-
ety of programs to be avail-
able to Pennsylvanians.

There are also programs to
increase interaction between
academic and student affairs
and affairs between the fac-
ulty and the student body.
These programs are based on
Pitt’s current programs
including Freshman Studies,
the Emerging Leader
Program, the Early
Intervention Program and the
Bradford campus’ Learning
Cluster.

Both existing programs
and planned programs are
included in the budget
request to better help the
commonwealth decide the
appropriation Pitt is to
receive.

According to Evanto, every
October the university is
required to submit a budget
request for the following fis-
cal year to the U.S.
Department of Education.

That document includes a
statement from Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, information on
cost savings, restructuring, a
section on the recruitment
and retention of minority stu-
dents and numerous tables
and graphs.

Once the education depart-
ment receives Pitt’s proposal
it formulates its own budget.
At the end of November, the
U.S. secretary of education
then submits that proposal to
the secretary of the budget
who develops the governor’s

community, branch campus-
es, other state—related institu-
tions and for members of the
General Assembly.
Generally, both the House of
Representatives and the
Senate each propose one or
more budgets.

a budget is June 30. It is
during this time that
deliberations take place
and changes are made. Pitt is

A separate resolution is
needed to issue funding to
non-preferred appropria-

pass by a two-thirds majority
in both houses, rather than

 

simple majority vote.

Evanto explained it is not
the university’s intention, nor
is it in its best interest to
raise tuition any higher than
necessary.

“We have taken a hard
look at the university and
we have made a concerted
effort not to raise tuition. We
have based the budget on an
assumption of a 3.5 percent
tuition increase and a 6
percent commonwealth
appropriation increase.”

Pitt has complied with this
every year and plans a
tuition increase that is still 1
percent below the program’s
ceiling. However, Pitt is
again requesting the elimina-
tion of the Tuition Challenge
Grant.

“The effect the program
has is the tuition cap, cou-
pled with the very small
increase in commonwealth
appropriations does not give

the university the amount
of flexibility it needs to
undertake new programs or
to expand the programs
we currently have,” Evanto
said.

“It has been very restrictive
as far as the budget of the
university is concerned,”
Evanto said of the Tuition
Challenge Grant and its
requested removal.

Two task forces, one to
look at non-preferred appro-
priations and the second
to look at higher education
have held hearings attended
by Pitt members this month.
Both committees have
been charged with making
recommendations by Nov.
30.

Pitt Provost James Maher
and Senior Vice Chancellor
for business and finance Ben
Tuchi represented Pitt at
those hearings, as did the
staff of the governmental
relations office.

and beliefs of the post—baby boom gen-
eration  what is this generation really
like?” asked Randolph.

According to Susan Komives, profes-
sor of counseling and personnel
services at the University of
Maryland, more than 8.5 million under-
graduate students presently attending
college are between the ages of 17
to 24.

“Eight—and-a-half million people rep-
resent a very broad [diversity],”
Komives said. “By gender, by race and
ethnicity, certainly by disabled condi-
tions  these are very, very diverse
people.”

While the panel all agreed that
this generation of college students is
the most diverse in recent history, there
was some dissent on the subject of
labels.

The term Generation X was first
used as the title of Douglas Coupland’s
1991 book about misguided young
adults living in the Palm Springs
desert. ‘

Co—author of the books “Generations”
and “13th Gen,” Bill Strauss said the

expression Generation X is a pop cul-
ture creation which does have the impli-

-cation of slackers and people who have

left the economy and don’t see a future
for themselves.

“That’s an inaccurate portrayal, but
it’s a reputation that’s part of this gener-
ations problem,” Strauss said.

“You can categorize [Generation X]
as all Americans too young to remem-
ber the assassination of John F.
Kennedy.”

In 1983 a major report, “A Nation at
Risk,” was published which defined this

generation as a rising tide of mediocrity, -

said Jack Warner, the dean of student
services at Bristol Community College
in Massachusetts.

“They said that these students were
so bad that if this had been done by
foreign powers, we would have
considered this an act of war,” Warner
said.

“And ever since then there has been
a non—stop series of reports coming
from universities about how dumb
this generation is.”

Warner said the students are being
sent mixed messages, that they are

The Pitt News, Thursday, October 27, 1994

doing well in high school but being told
they are not prepared for college.

“I think a lot of the reports that
are published that say how dumb
students would be, would never
have reached the printer if it hadn’t
have been for some pretty smart
people in their young 20’s fixing
the [computer] problems,” Warner
said. '

Following the panelist discussion, a
group of college students was asked to
give impressions on the labels its gener-
ation had been given.

“When I think of Generation X, I
think of a group of individuals in our
society right now who do not go along
with‘ the traditional norms,” said Mark
Jackson, from Southeastern University.
“They kind of make it up as they go
along.”

Macalester College student Allison
Gibson said, “I think every year there
are some defining terms from an older
generation. It doesn’t mean much to me.
I don’t want to be labeled  I don’t
think terms like that are inclusive of me
or what other people that I know are
doing.” -

Assault

‘From page 1
assault provide conflicting
testimony as to the degree of
consent on the part of the
victim or whether or not
coercion, in any form, was
used,” Haley said in the
report.

In addition, Haley said,
“The victim was so intoxi-
cated that she was unable to
act in her own best interest.”

“In view of these findings,
we have concluded that this
activity can be properly
labeled as sexual assault,”
Haley said.

Rifkin said that according
to “[IFC’s] investigation, we
did not find any sexual
assault to occur.”

“The IFC supports Dr.
Haley’s decision, although

in theory the IFC believes »

social probation is only
detrimental to the fraterni-
ties,” Rifkin said.

According to Rifkin, IFC
recommended the sanctions
to Haley because the IFC
acknowledged some “culpa-
bility with the incident.”

Haley said in his report,
“The council’s recommenda-
tion for social probation
contains no time period, nor
does it recognize the shared
responsibility of the other
two fraternities.”

Haley added for that rea-
son and “for thedifferent
degree of responsibility for
the incident,” some form of
probation was taken against
all the fraternities.

Along with the social pro-
bation, the three fraternities
that sponsored the combined
party where the alleged sex-
ual assault took place will
perform community service.

“This office is requiring
that a specific period of six
weeks of community service
be rendered by each of the
fraternities to the various
community organizations
involved in substance abuse
or women’s issues,” Haley
said.

“Our goal is to prevent
this from happening again,”
Rifkin said. “This is the first
alleged sexual assault that
has been taken this far at
this university in 15 years.”

Department of Public
Safety Director Rick Boyd
said Haley did a fair job.

“The decision seems equi-
table and fair and makes
sense to me,” Boyd said.

Panhellenic Association
President Kelly Reddy said
the process was fair to the
fraternities.

“I think in general the fra-
ternities really try hard to
follow the university policy,
but in this case, after Dr.
Haley read the report, it’s
fair that sanctions were
given to the fraternities,”

. Reddy said.

A Look AI Local Post-Jazz Heroes WATER SHED by Mike Shcmley

For over a decade, jazz
music has grown by leaps and
bounds on the legendary
stage of New York’s Knitting
Factory. Therefore, you’d think
the club would embrace Water
Shed, a quintet pushing the
musical envelope here in town
with their own brand of post-
jazz (my term, not theirs) for
nearly four years.

Unfortunately, it didn’t turn
out that way.

For one thing, when Water
Shed landed in New York last
fall, they played to a crowd of
eight. And after hearing about
the great music that comes
from the Knitting Factory, they
expected a little more from the
club in the way of character.

‘‘I’m sure on a good night,
it’s packed to the walls and it’s
really happening,” says Ben
Opie, the band’s saxophonist,
“but it’s not any less depress-
ing than any other club when
it’s empty. To give it credit, it
has the best acoustics l’ve
ever heard in a club that size.
But, you know  it’s dumpy.”

While New York didn’t deliv-
er the impact it could have, the
first leg of Water Shed’s tour,
in support of their debut CD
Duck Bill Hammer, went well
enough, leaving open the
potential for future tours.
“When things go nicely, it’s a
real charge. You get positive
responses from people you
don’t know. it’s not just your
friends coming up saying you
did a good job that night,” he
said with a laugh.

While Opie’s observation
about friends-as-the-audience
epitomizes most local bands,
Water Shed has been able to
pack in crowds that extend
beyond the regular indie
rock/underground folks that
frequent shows. Part of this
stems from the way the quintet
constantly expands and
reshapes their music.

You can't accurately call
Water Shed a jazz group. For
starters, their lineupof saxo-
phone, cello, guitar, bass gui-
tar and drums bucks the stan-
dard jazz instrumentation,
adding the potential for rather
jarring voicings in the music.
(Curlew, another New York
band, sports the same group-
ing, but don’t call them “jazz”
either.) At the same time,
Water Shed can pull out a
chestnut like Ellington’s “l’m
Beginning To See The Light”
and swing it harder than some
high-brow big band.

But they aren't “free jazz”
either. Sections of their music
may veer off into what Mum
and Pop would call noise, with
drummer Jay Matula crashing
and splattering on his kit or
Opie’s sax eliciting pops at
machine gun speed. But the
wildness occurs within the
context of structured composi-

The avant sounds of locals, Water Shed, play a special Jazzoween gig at Luciano's Coffeehouse this Saturday.

tions. At most gigs, you’ll see
the band reading from music
stands as they play.

Water Shed draws from both
styles. Then they go off on a
tangent, bending the linear
musical time line into 90-
degree angle and running it off
the page. Their diversity has
earned them opening slots at
local performances by avant-
gardists Charles Gayle and
Thomas Chapin, as well as
appearances on WDUQ-FM, a
station which normally avoids
all but the safest jazz. And the
band still manages to build on
their musical palette as time
goes by.

For about the past year, the
quintet’s music has been
expanding and becoming
more elaborate. When they
formed nearly four years ago,
many of their compositions
recalled some of John Zorn’s
work with Naked City. Opie,
who writes most of the materi-
al, juxtaposed fast melodies
with stop-start rhythms, leav-
ing only room for the theme
and maybe a quick solo by
him or guitarist Darryl Fleming.
The songs were brief, but they
overflowed with content.

Opie still enjoys playing
older tunes like “Power Strip,”
where the melody and solos
play out over a repetitive
three-note bass vamp, but he
doesn’t want the music to
adhere to one formula. “After a
year of writing pieces that
would last on average about
three to five minutes, you start
to generate some more com-
plex ideas," the saxman said.

This desire for more complexi-
ty resulted in extended compo-
sitions which contain different
movements.

One inspiration for this came
from the music of Tim Berne.
‘‘I don’t try to imitate what he
does, but he has this amazing
ability  of writing a composi-
tion and it'll be in three or four
sections. Each section isn’t

necessarily a development of

the previous section. it’s like
he’s writing suites, “ Opie con-
ﬁnued.

“l’m interested in more
extended forms and how you
develop it  how you contrast
material. What is the relation-
ship of one section of the
piece to another?”

in person, this kind of mater-
ial can be riveting. Dynamics
swoop around. A piece starts
out at a normal volume level.
Then everyone backs off
except bassist Jeff Stringer
and cellist Erin Snyder, who
sustain a droning note. Opie
begins a solo that rises from
soft notes into a frenzy, with
Matula whacking away at the
snare, breaking up any trance
you were drifting into.

Opie said he likes keeping
the music diverse because he
gets bothered by bands that
stick to the same style, song
after song. “l want to be able
to say, ‘OK, let’s make some
noise, but I also want to be
able to play a ballad."‘

But by the same token, he
doesn't want the group’s
music to sound forced, with
the set becoming a “philosoph-
ical exercise. You think of

ways, over a period of time, to
complement and contrast
material within itself. You’ve
got some heavy stuff here, so
bring it down at this point,”
Opie said. “You orchestrate
the set like you would the gen-
eral form of one piece of
music,” he said.

Realizing how serious that
sounded, Opie laughed, say-

ing, “That probably sounds far

more heavy than it neededtof”

While Opie sounds serious
about Water Shed, the band
never gets too serious about
what they do. I realized this at
a recent Bloomfield Bridge
Tavern gig when Opie began a
solo. it sounded like a cue to
the next section. But after
blowing for about a minute, he
took the horn out of his mouth,
glared at Fleming, and barked,
“Play something!” As struc-
tured as their music gets, they
still leave room for humor.

In one section of “Duck Bill
Hammer,” Opie leads a
cacaphonous ca||-and-
response with the band.
Whatever sound he whips out
of his horn, the rest of the
band must imitate. In person
he tests their mettle, playing
fragmented melodies or long
squeals with vocal growls. And
they get it right, even if they
have to answer with a bark
themselves.

The band’s freewheeling
side showed up during a stu-
dio session that yielded a song
for a Sun Ra tribute album.
With “The Perfect Man” the
bandleader took a shot at surf
rock, and while Opie admits

their reading won’t sound as
strange as the original, it ought
to be a hoot. The album, which
Ca|ifornia’s Fiastascan will
release toward the year’s end,
also features such heavies as
the Splatter Trio, Ken
Vandermark and legend'ary
avant-gardist John Tchicai,
putting our local heroes in
good company. ,

While New York might not
be ready for Water Shed, visit-
ing musicians have said that
things are better in this town
than inthe Big Apple. “l’ve had
some people comment that
they’re really amazed at the
sort of response and the raw
numbers that we can get here
in Pittsburgh,” Opie said.

And the raw numbers turn
out to see Water Shed take
risks on a regular basis. This
often shows up in collabora-
tions with like-minded musi-
cians and artists, some as
bizarre as a pairing with avant-
cinemists from , Orgone
Cinema, creating a sponta-
neous and improvised sound-
track to film screenings.

Their performance this
weekend takes the sonorities
in yet another direction. In
anticipation of Halloween,
actress Tracey Turner will add
to the musical cauldron on
Saturday, reading tales of the
macabre.

formance’s comin’ at ya no

Coming out this weekend
is the big sci-fi epic Stargate.
While the majority of us were
hangingiout at bars and coffee
houses, showing off our taste
by talking about Tarintino’s
Pulp Fiction or how we can't
wait to see Ed Wood and other
cinemas, some people have
been talking about movies.
The buzz has been about
Stargate. “lt’s supposed to be
the space-age Lawrence of
Arabia” has been whispered
from ear to ear all across
America’s comic book shops
and hobby stores. “|t’s going to
be the next STAR WARS,”
they've been saying.

Well, let me tell you young
whippersnappers something.
STAR WARS was the ‘first
movie to demand to be put in
all caps. lt practically invented
merchandising. l had all the
action figures: Han Solo, Darth
Vadar and the Tatooine
Cantina play set. l had hours
of fun creating blaster scars on
Imperial Storm Troopers with a
stolen Bic lighter. It makes me
sad to think that I'll never see
another kid dressed up as R2-
D2 in an upside down garbage
can. No matter what they say
about Stargate, it will never be
another STAR WARS.

Stargate is a $40 million epic
by MGM which is supposed to
look to be worth about $100
million. it is already creating
talk as the first real science fic-
tion epic to be made since the
disastrous Dune. Dune, the
movie who’s huge bill and box
office death made it doubtful
that another large scale sci-fi
epic would ever be made.
However, Stargate was made,
partly due to the pushing of its
director. Roland Emmerich
originally came up with the
story while in film school and
has gotten to direct it. Roland

who? Well, if you didn't know,
Emmerich is the auteur behind
such moving pieces as Moon
44 and Universal Soldier.
Moon 44 played all of two
weeks in most cities. On the
other hand, it’s video release
more than made back the $2.5
million spent on it. A third of
that money was on special
effects, which might explain
why it was as bad as it was. It
did, however, boast some
good atmosphere and believ-
ably claustrophobic sets.
Universal Soldier, the Jean-
Claude Van Damme vehicle,
was a money-making
machine. it cost $20 million

"and ended up grossing about

$100 million. That might
explain how Stargate got
made. '

Speaking of the muscles
from Brussels, Jean-Claude, if
you’re reading this article while
you’re in Pittsburgh shooting
Sudden Death, welcome to
our beautiful city. As for the
rest of you, you'll bethankful
to know that Jean-Claude was
probably too busy shooting
Streetfighter — The Battle for
Shadaloo at the time to make
an appearance in Stargate. if
you happen to run into Jean-
Claude on the streets of
Pittsburgh, do me a favor. Ask
him for me, why are the street
fighters battling over Indian
food and is it Lamb Shadaloo
or Chicken?

So Stargate doesn’t get Van
Damme, but it does get Kurt
Russell, that other action-act-
ing talent. No matter what’s
been said of Kurt, he did a
great job at Disney in The
Computer Wore Tennis
Shoes. Also, Big Trouble in
Little China. is one of the
world’s most under-appreciat-
ed films. In Stargate Kurt gets
to play Colonel Jack O’Neil,

type.” It is apparently to
counter-balance the other

‘male leads, James Spader

and Jaye Davidson. Spader
plays Egyptologist Daniel
Jackson. Spader is known as
a “serious” actor and may best
be remembered for his sensi-
tive roles, as in Less Than
Zero and Sex, Lies, and
Videotape. Jaye Davidson
plays Ra the Egyptian boy.
Everyone knows Jaye
Davidson, he's the guy who
flashed Mr. Happy to Stephan
Rhea in The Crying Game.
This is not the beginnings of

Egyptologist, a colonel and his
native boy. No, it seems Ra

not terribly interested in the

plot, then the question is

“What about the effects?”
Stargate’s premise sets up a

great promise for some inter- T

esting visuals. Aside from
video imaging, which all the
studios are doing since
Jurassic Park, they used some
good old forced exposure
shots on scenes which feature
the alien star ships. in case
you don’t know, forced expo-
sure is just like they did in
Godzilla. You put something
you want to look big close to
the camera and something
you want to look small far
away from the camera. Then
film it so that the close thing
looks really big compared to
the thing far away. Aside from
cutting a film's cost, if done

. right it can create a more real-

istic look than the latest com-
puter-generated effects. The
producers did spend some
money with location shoots in
Egypt, so it’ll feature real pyra-
mids! The fake pyramids in the
movie were shot in a hangar
which originally held Howard
Hugh’s Spruce Goose. It was
the only structure large
enough to hold some of the
gigantic sets called for in the
script. An idea so good that

Stargate also features some
amazing design work for the
alien costumes. There are
huge helmets that look like the

The sets, running with the
Egyptian motif, rival Dune’s
and Blade Runner’s in

lt’s quite fitting (but also
somewhat unsettling) that in
the year SoCal punk is starting
to find its way into the main-
stream, old-timers Bad
Religion — an innovative force
for over a decade on their
homegrown indie Epitaph —
have found their way to a
major label.

Coincidence?

While MTV and most alter-
native radio spent the summer
blasting such bands as Green
Day and the Offspring through
every medium, Bad Religion
also received their due in rota-
tion (though less frequently).
They garnered sizable air play
for the title track of Stranger
Than Fiction, and struck a
chord with their balls-to-the-
wall style — a testament both

to their growing appeal and,
perhaps, society‘s readiness to
accept hardcore punk.

The band’s ninth album
overall (and first on Atlantic) is
cut directly from the classic
punk mantra that spawned the
Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks
— killer guitars and smart
lyrics. There isn’t anything new
about guitarists Greg Hetson
and Brett Gurewitz’s musical
slant — but knowing that the
licks take a back seat to the
words, they adequately serve
their function, providing a
strong backbone to what,
plainly put, is a monster of an
overwhelming sound.

Alternating between lead

Schayer’s machine gun-drums
and a bass that doesn’t have

writers dance around nothing,
using extreme imagery and
incredibly creative lyrical
hooks to keep the album truly
alive when the music doesn’t
necessarily hold up its end.
Pulling no punches and
establishing the climate from
the first song, Gurewitz pens a
warning from the first lines of
the album:
“Mother/Father/Look at your
little monster,” lead-vocalist
Greg Graffin bellows on the
albums first and best track,
“incomplete,” invoking pity as
“the butt of the worst joke in
history.” Graffin, “a good inten-
tion gone bad,” is in finest form
on a song fittingly cut in half by
.a solo that highlights the

Those SoCal punk rock preachers gone major label, Bad Religion.

scathing adroitness the band
can show.

Graffin’s vocals prove to be
a constant in the face of occa-
sionally boring riffs, especially
on such songs as “Better Off
Dead.” Stepping away from
the music for the only time on
the record, he smugly assures
the listener “The next time I
create the universe, l’ll make
sure you participate,” while
“Television” features a cameo
by Rancid’s Lint Armstrong,
who provides a nice juxtaposi-
tion of vocal styles, matching
his coarser howls with
Graffin’s bellows.

The album’s title track and
first release houses the most
creative lyrics and strongest

 

music on the album, mixing
references to schoolgirl
games, fellatio and literary
giants with a descending then
quickly ascending scale that
combines for an unsettling, if
not terrific sound. Gurewitz’s
lyrics assure us that “Life is
the crummiest book I ever
read,” and wonders “lf I could
fly high above the world/would
I see a bunch of living dots
spell the/word stupidity?”

But Gurewitz’s barrel of
songs isn’t without its misses,
with efforts like “lnfected” and
“The Handshake” beating us
over the head with obvious

imagery, and the album end- ’

ing as it began —— incomplete.

Alls Farr: Love, War, and
Running for President

By Mary Matalin and James
Carville, with Peter Knobler
Random House

$24.00

A/I’s Fair: Love, War, and
Running for President is the per-
fect book for political junkies, but it
is also for anyone who has more
than a passing interest about what
it takes to attain the highest office
in the land. More than a mere jour-
nal about the 1992 presidential
race, it is a story about how people
in politics come to be where they
are. This aspect does not only
apply to politicians, but also to the
people behind the talking heads.
Along the way, there is some his-
tory, a little romance and a vision
of the grit in politics which would
make anyone considering entering
the arena take stock of their moti-
vaﬁons. -

The spin doctors finally tell their
own stories. Information revealed
for the first time includes how the
hippie daughter of a Croatian
came to be a staunch Republican
and why a Louisiana Cajun would
choose to enter politics through
the Democratic camp. Their rise to
prominence is also told. How
Carville went from standing sob-
bing over his unemployment in the
rain to running the 1992 presiden-
tial campaign is explained. Matalin
finally tells how it is possible to go

   

from a Chicago Democrat to one
of the top positions in the
Republican party.

Along the way are the war sto-
ries. These form the greater part of
the book, especially once 1992 is
reached. But before the big one,
other campaigns, such as
Carville’s turning three-time loser
Bob Casey into the governor of
Pennsylvania, are in there.

Included in the war stories are
also lessons. Those involved in
the political process could profit
from the principles which manifest
themselves. Some are even
spelled out, such as Matalin's car-
dinal rule number one: “Never lie
to the press.” Others become
apparent in the telling, as in
Carville’s war room where the idea
was to create a sense of purpose
and mad urgency.

Those who want a balanced
view of the 1992 campaign and
some insight into the process for
the next time around will do well
by picking up this book. What the
insiders thought and how they
reacted to everything -from
Clinton’s draft letter to the death of
Lee Atwater comes through with
clarity and insight. While they are

4 political animals first, the truth is

nonetheless often in telling, so a
balanced and unpedantic view
comes out about the campaign
and the lives of those inside the
world of politics.
-Ben Jackson

Mil.‘

    

Century (Digital Boy),” a song they did
for an earlier Epitaph album that really
isn't good enough to warrant a re-
release. Now an MTV video, one won-
ders their motives for including it on a
record loaded with marketable songs.

With Stranger Than Fiction, Bad
Religion makes a semi-successful jump
from an indie to a major, maintaining one
foot in punk’s rarified air, while placing
the other in a big-money, corporate
smog.

But whether a major-label atmosphere
breathes as pure as Epitaph’s or only
proves to choke them remains decidedly
up in the air.

-— Jason Brame

4!’
Danzig
American

Six years after its initial release on
Danzig, “Mother” spawned from the ‘MTV
apothecary’s brew last spring. What fol-
lowed was a kinder, gentler Glenn
Danzig intent on selling his once fore-
boding image to a Jon Stewart crowd.

A Metallica-style sellout could have
crowned him a frat-rock god.

But Danzig’s thorny 4p arrives in time
to redeem the man and the band.

Amidst the opening hum of guitarist
John Christ’s steely strings and now ex-
Danzig drummer Chuck Biscuit’s cymbal
slapping, Glenn bellows the album’s res-
urrecting first lyrics from “Brand New
God” (I am a walking screaming hell/ a
thing of torture to behold/ this vivisection

behold).

With that vocal flourish, Danzig bran-
dishes a heretofore unleashed vigor.
Continuing down the tracks laid by “lt’s
Coming Down” and “Violet Fire” on
1993's Thrall EP, 4p is the heaviest
Danzig record to date. It's also the best.
Like 1994's other crowning heavy-metal
release, Soundgarden's Superunknown,
4p captures a matured band in peak per-
formance.

4p is loaded with no fewer than eight ,

tracks that rank among the band’s best,
with “Bringer of Death” fronting the bar-
rage.

Tight as hell, “Bringer of Death” begins
with the rattle of machine-gun fire over
Christ’s expectant guitar. The bullets
cease, and Christ’s groove is born.
Biscuit’s drums and Eerie Von’s bass
arrive, furthering the riderless wave.
Glenn’s raspy vocals catch and seethe
(See the devil kiss the hand of god/ see
the devil crying tears of flame/ see the
devil bite the hand of christ/ and know
the devil is the work of god). '

The album is wrought with this iron-
tight, groove-ridden metal. But the sim-
plicity of “Mother” is gone. And anyone
jumping from “Mother” to 4p could get
confused, because it goes like this:
Glenn broke up the Misfits because they
were creatively limiting. The experiment-
ing that began with Samhain and worked
its way through the first three Danzig
records culminates with 4p, the defining
album that he’s wanted to make since
the end of the Misfits.

Opinions
Clinton in the Middle East

President Clinton arrived in the Middle East yesterday on a mis-
sion of peace. His tour of the region started in Egypt and included
the historic signing of a peace treaty between Israel and'Jordan.

The peace treaty is only the second with an Arab country, the
first being in 1979 with Egypt. The treaty is significant not only
for this reason, but because of the continuing progress for the
future of peaceful relations throughout the Middle East, especially
in light of recent terrorist activity by the militant Hamas group.

However the treaty itself is not without controversy. Yasir
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was
not invited to the treaty signing and is angry both at the slight and
at references in the treaty to Islamic holy places, which Arafat
views as his people’s holy sites. Also, Jordanian and Palestinian
Islamic groups are unhappy with the peace treaty.

Clinton’s role in the evolving Middle East peace process is seen
as bringing “in” Syria. Clinton’s upcoming visit is the first by an
American president since Richard Nixon went to Damascus in
1974. The peace talks between Syria and Israel have stalled, and
some hope Clinton’s visit will lead to a breakthrough.

It is time for President Clinton to get a break from the national
media. With an economy which is only getting stronger and his
strong showing in recent international affairs, Clinton deserves a
little more positive coverage.

Halloween safety reminder

Soon the streets and parties of Oakland will be filled with
ghosts, goblins and ghouls. Yes, that’s right ladies and gentle-
man, it is Halloween weekend once again and, with the fortuitous
placing of Halloween on a Monday, the weekend will be long
and wild indeed.

Of course the scariest site this weekend may very likely be on
the football field where (hopefully) Pitt will thrash the Temple
Owls. .

But while celebrating this weekend, The Pitt News would like
to remind students to take added precautions this weekend.
Halloween weekend is traditionally one of wild revehy, and this
one will likely be no different. Although most of the following
advice is valid any night, it is especially important during the
next few days. .

1. Travel in groups. The aggravated assault the other day
serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of our urban carn-
pus. Travelling alone is perhaps the single thing which can place
you at most risk for being jumped.

2. Plan ahead. As always, there will be plenty of people who
will get “smashed” this weekend. Make arrangements ahead of
time for where and when you’ll be places. The only thing more
dangerous than walking alone on the streets of Oakland is walk-
ing alone and drunk.

3. Have fun!! That is of course the best advice we can give.
Relax, chill out and have a good time, but please do it safely and
responsibly —— and don’t forget your studies.

Aloser look at the governor's race

t is now
apparent to
anyone

who turns on a
television that
Cam-paign
‘94 is in full
swing. There

 

lnis

_ are a few
Ka.tl_1l comments I
Metinko would like to

make on the
campaigning, particularly the
race for governor. I began see-
ing the advertisements for Lt.
Gov. Mark Singel, the democ-
ratic candidate for governor,
and Rep. Tom Ridge, the
republican candidate for gover-
nor, at the end of September.

The first thing I noticed
about these ads was how vivid
they are. I guess candidates
have learned that the most
effective advertisements are the
ones that play on society’s fears
and frustrations, not the ones
that introduce you to the candi-
date or the candidate’s plat-
form.

The success of these ads may
be the result of years of elec-
tions based on the televised
empty campaign promises of
politicians. Perhaps the public
would be more interested in the
issues and platforms if politi-
cians ever achieved half‘ of
what they promised. But since
they haven’t, politicians have
found the type of advertise-
ments made famous in the
Bush/Dukakis campaign of
1988 very effective. Who can
forget the ad featuring former
Gov. Michael Dukakis in the
tank, or the convict going
through the revolving prison
door

Still, Ridge has taken this
kind of advertising to a new
level. His ad with Jan Licence,
a 34-year-old Montgomery
County woman raped by a 16-
year-old, telling her story_does
little but scare women into lis-
tening. Once you listen, you
realize that you find out very

little about what Ridge actually
stands for.

The commercial states that
her attacker was convicted and
sentenced as a juvenile and if
Ridge had been governor the
teen would have been prosecut-
ed as an adult. The point is that
an adult crime deserves an
adult sentence. An interesting
fact in the Licence case is that
the prosecution wanted to treat
her offender as an adult, but the
judge would not allow it. In
addition, Ridge has never been
an active juvenile justice
reformer.

The National Organization of‘

Women’s Pennsylvania chapter
has requested that Ridge pull
the ad. They state, according to
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, it
doesn’t explain Ridge’s posi-
tion on “juvenile justice
reform” as much as it “plays on
the real fears that women have
about rape and their safety.”

More interesting, perhaps,
than Ridge’s ad is the fact that
Ridge’s original crime plan did
not require an automatic trans-
fer of a juvenile rapist to adult
court like the Licence story
indicates. In fact, The Post-
Gazette reports, Licence’s
attacker would not have quali-
fied for an automatic transfer
under the original plan. Ridge
changed his crime bill only
three weeks before the ad first
appeared. Under the new plan,
Licence’s attacker would be
transferred to adult court.

The first plan required that an
attacker between the ages of 15
and 17 have a history of serious
crime to be transferred to adult
court, whereas the new plan
requires the attacker commit
the crime with a firearm or
weapon or have a history of
serious crime.

The one question we must all
ask ourselves before pulling a
lever in the November election
is: if a candidate can change
their policy in order to accom-
modate an advertisement, what

else will they change it for?

The other aspect I found
unique to this campaign is the
timeframe candidates are utiliz-
ing for campaigning.
Candidates began television
ads at the end of September. I
remember when television
advertising, at least for state
campaigns, didn’t begin until
the middle or end of October. I
only bring up this point to
show how much money is
being wasted in political cam-
paigns.

Obviously, a candidate can
reach the most people through
the medium of television,
which probably explains why it
is also the most expensive.

Television can be used effec-
tively to give voters the candi-
date’s platform. The problem is
that the candidates do not use it
for this reason. They make
commercials that are gripping,
mudslinging or intentionally
vague leaving the voter to fer-
ret out the important informa-
tion. In any event, the voting
public learns very little about
the candidate. They may get to
meet the spouse and kids, but
that’s not what we vote on, or
at least not what we should
vote on, is it?

I hope candidates don’t get
so caught up in the improving
technology and forget what
old-fashioned campaigning
used to be. Campaigning used
to involve actually meeting the
constituents. It involved hear-
ing the voters’ concerns and
answering theirquestions. It
meant town meetings and door-
to-door visits and understand-
ing the people being represent-
ed.

Just ask yourself when you
vote on Nov. 8, are you voting
for the candidate because you

~ agree on the issues and their

proposed solutions, or because
you just had to pick one?

Pitt P.A.

announcer
resigns

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Pitt footbal1’s public address
announcer Don Ireland resigned
yesterday after making deroga-
tory comments directed toward
West Virginia fans over the
loudspeaker two weeks ago at
Pitt Stadium.

“I just felt rather than Pitt take
the blame, the most honorable
thing to do was to resign,”
Ireland, 38, said. “I don’t want
to tarnish the university’s good
name. i

“I wasn’t trying to humiliate
anyone. I don’t think it was pro-
fane or derogatory. I feel bad if
anyone took it the wrong way.”

Ireland made three jokes
overall. He alluded to a tractor
with its lights on and no—smok-
ing corn-cob pipes, and he
announced that Billy Ray Joe
Bob’s mother had called. The
West Virginia fans took offense
to his comments.

“I typically threw in my
humorous comments,” he said.
“I’m an upbeat, real positive
type of guy.

“I thought‘ the joke about the
com-cob pipe — the only per-
son who I would offend would

“We scored a couple of

said.

Graf finished the scoring in
the first half with 18:46 left.
He popped it up over Braga on
an assist from senior John
Lopus to give Pitt the 3-0
lead.

The half ended with the
Mountaineers getting their
best scoring opportunity of the
half on a shot that ricochetted
off the cross-bar above
Panther goalie Kirk Brodows.

“We played real well,”
Brodows said. “We stepped in
and played real well together.
They weren’t as strong as I
thought they were going to
be.”

The second half started off
on the right foot for the
Panthers. That is the right foot
of Todd Graf, as he scored a
goal very similar to his own in
the first half. Braga had come
out of his goal, and Graf lifted
the shot over the fallen goal
keeper. The goal was; unassist-

board as freshman Andy

Battle of Big East's best
Virginia Tech vs. Miami could decide conference title

By Jack Becker
Senior Staff Writer

With the college football
season coming to a close, the
stakes in the Big East football
championship are increasing
with every game. Two remain-
ing matchups will have direct
ramifications on which team
walks away the conference
title.

At the moment, the game
with primary importance is the
Nov. 5 contest between Big
East leader Syracuse (4-0 in
conference, 6-1 overall) and
Miami (2-0, 5-1). However, if
the conference championship
is to ride on that game, Miami
is first going to have to beat a
tough Virginia Tech (4-1, 7-1)
squad on Saturday.

The Miami-Virginia Tech
game, which will be played on
ABC at the Orange Bowl in
Miami, Fla., is a meeting of
the Big East’s top two—rated
teams in The Associated Press
Poll. The Hurricanes are No.
6, and the Hokies are No. 13.

For Virginia Tech, it’s a
game that can raise the level of
the program. The Hokies are
in the running for their first
ever conference championship
and are the only team that
needs some help to pull it off.

Virginia Tech is the only con-
tender with a blemish on its
conference record, a 28-20
loss to Syracuse.

“If we could win, it would
change our status in a hurry,”
Virginia Tech coach Frank
Beamer said in a press release.

For the Hokies to win the

difficult task. Virginia Tech,
with a breakthrough season in
1993 that included a 9-3
record and 45-20 victory over
Indiana in the Independence
Bowl, was destroyed 21-2 at
home last year by Miami.
Tech, off to its best start
since 1967, will roar into

layoff with a sprained ankle
and pounded the Panthers for
82 yards and two touchdowns.
Also, starting offensive guard
Damien McMahon is expected
to be ready to play after a four-
game absence.

But earning a victory against
Miami in the Orange Bowl,

season loss to the Huskies.
The Hurricanes won the battle
for the state of Florida two
weeks ago over rival Florida
State, propelling them to the
No. 6 ranking.-

“Wherever Miami is ranked
in the polls this week, it proba-
bly isn’t high enough,”
Beamer said. “I know there are
some unbeaten teams up there
at the top, but none of them
are any better than Miami.”

Miami, which bombed West
Virginia 38-6 last Saturday, is
living through the air again
this season.

Quarterback Frank Costa has
thrown for 1,431 yards and 10
touchdowns with a 45-yard
average per TD catch. Costa’s
favorite target, Chris T. Jones,
has caught five TD’s and has
409 yards on the season.

Running back Larry Stewart
leads the ground attack with
466 yards and eight touch-
downs.

The Hurricanes’ defense, led

end Warren Sapp, has held
three teams out of the end
zone this year — Arizona

Panthers look to crack conference curse Saturday

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt football team will
look to end a six game slide
when the Panthers (1-7, 0-4
in the Big East) face the
Temple Owls (2-5, 0-3)
Saturday.

But in order for the
Panthers to get back into the
win column they must
accomplish one thing.

“We got to keep Henry
Burris [Temple’s quarter-
back] in check,” Pitt line-
b a c k e r
G e r a 1 d
S i m p s o n
said. “We
have to blitz
and contain
him.

“We were watching film
and he is the type of quarter-
back that if he breaks the
containment he is going to
run. If he doesn’t break it he
has the ability to stay inside
and throw it. Most quarter-
backs we faced, they get
sacked or they just throw it
away. But he will stay in
there as long as he can just to
find a receiver.”

In order to win this week-
end the Pitt defensive unit,
which has given up an aver-
age of 424.4 yards a game,
must contain Temple’s signal
caller.

In Burris they will face one

Against all odds

LB Clark overcomes adversiries

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

Growing up in South
Philadelphia, Hayes Clark
never imagined playing
against Temple University. In
fact, playing major college
football wasn’t something
Clark had in mind. 2

Instead of worrying about
college ball, all Clark wanted
to do was hang around his
brothers Charles and
Terrence.

Now, five years later,
things have changed, as the
linebacker who is listed at 6
feet 2 inches and 220 pounds
will face his hometown team
— for the fourth year in a
row ——— without the watchful
eyes of his brothers.

Regardless of the outcome
in Saturday’s contest, Clark
knows he has to move on
with his life.

“It will hurt [if we lose],"
Clark said. “That will put the
stake in my heart, but you
got to look forward to the
next one. Like coach Majors

said: ‘The most important‘

shot in golf is the next shot.’
I'll say we took a lot of
tough losses this year, very
close losses.”

But nothing that the senior

are going through right now
can compare with what he
went through in 1990.

During that year, Hayes
lost both his brothers.

“We had just played Kent
State in the first game of the
season,” he recalls. “I called
home. I don’t know what
made me call home. I sensed
something funny in every-
body’s voices. My sister-in-
law told me to come home; it
was an emergency. Then my
other brother got on the
phone and told me to come
home. Nobody would tell me

what happened.”

That is when Clark decided
to call a cousin and ask for
an explanation. His cousin
told him Charles was shot in
the leg.

“I wanted to believe this,
but I could tell he didn’t get
shot in the leg because they
would have told me that from
the beginning,” Clark said.
“So I had an idea that some-
thing worse had happened.”

What he wasn’t being told
was his brother was shot in

the head after an argument
‘Clark, page P-9

pounder threw for 392 yards
and four touchdowns. Burris’
average of 240.4 yards a
game tops the Big East in
total offense.

Pitt’s defensive backfield,
which has given up an aver-
age of 224 passing yards a
game, will be faced with
stopping the second-best
passing offense (258 yards
an outing) in the conference.

“I talked to my brother
[Darrell, a defensive back at
Syracuse,] he played
[Temple,] and he said ‘The
quarterback is the key,”’
defensive back Derrick
Parker said. “If you give him
time to throw the ball he will
pick us apart and do what he
wants.

“I feel that if we contain
him then we will beat
Temple. If we just let him
have all day to sit back and
throw the ball he will have a
good against us.

“There ain’t no doubt in
my mind that we can stop the
run. They will not be able to
run the ball. They will have
to pass. It is going to come
down to the secondary. We
are going to have to make

A plays.”

While the Panthers’
defense is prepared to make
it a miserable trip for Burris
its offensive isn’t worrying
about the Owls.

“This week we are going to

do our own thing,” tight end
Dell Seagraves said. “We are
not worried about Temple’s
defense. We are trying to get
our offense right. This week
we are going to do what we
do best.

“It’s not going to be a cake
walk. We are just going to
have to go out there and hit
them hard and hit them first.
Keep hitting them until they
give up. We plan on making
this a physical game. We feel
this is one we can get so we
have to go out an execute.”

With Billy West leading
the conference in rushing,
the Panthers hope to run all
over the Owls’ defense,
which ranks last in the Big
East, allowing 219 yards on
the ground per game.

When West isn’t running
the ball, look for quarterback
John Ryan to call the shots.
Ryan, starting in his second
consecutive game, has
thrown for 641 yards and
five touchdowns in six
games.

“Look for John to have a
pretty good game this week-
end,” free safety David
Sumner said.

“It seems like he has
matured since losing his
starting position in the begin-
ning of the season. I think he
will get the job. done against
Temple.” -

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

At season’s start, Temple
was barely considered a
Division I team. Winless in
the Big East last year, the
Owls only mustered one win
against Eastern Michigan in
their opening game and
dropped their next 10.

Having already doubled
their wins (2-5) from last
year, the Owls are rebuilding
Temple brick by brick.

“Everything we have done
has been a dramatic improve-
ment over last year,” Temple
head coach Ron Dickerson
said.

Winning two games may
be a small
consolation
in the overall
rebuilding
picture, but
Temple has
definitely
taken giant
steps in the
right direc-

tion.

The Owls lead the Big East
and are 21st in the nation in
turnover margin. They’ve
collected 20 turnovers while
giving away only 14 of their
own.

“That was our number one
goal,” Dickerson said. “We
wanted to cause a bunch of
turnovers. It’s not something

that happens by accident,
you have to practice it.”

“Their turnover ratio
shows they are doing a lot of
good things,” Pitt coach
Johnny Majors said.

Temple also heads the con-
ference in the fewest penal-
ties. In seven games, it has
34 penalties, with an average
of 43.1 yards per game.

Granted, penalties and
turnovers may not be the

most glorifying categories,
but it’s positive.

“We are going to build our
program around young kids,”
Dickerson said. “We are in
no hurry. I was given a five-
year contract, and we’re
going to do it the right way.

“It may not happen this
year, but it’s eventually
going to happen.”

One young kid Dickerson
is building around is his 19-

year old sophomore quarter-
back Henry Burris.

Last week against
Syracuse, when Temple
scored 21 fourth-quarter
points only to lose 49-42,
Burris erupted for 392 yards,
a school record, and four
touchdowns. He completed
32 of 52 passes in his record-
breaking performance.

“Obviously we’re really
pleased with Henry’s perfor-

mance,’ Dickerson said.
“Henry gets better and better
as weeks go on.”

As an 18-year old fresh-
man last year, Burris’ meager
statistics of 691 yards and
five touchdowns have been
forgotten this season. With a
year behind him, he leads the
Big East in total offense with
1,683 yards, an average of
240.4 yards per game. He
has also thrown 14 touch-
downs.

“He’s a natural leader and
extremely positive,”
Dickerson said. “Henry is the
type of guy you like your
daughter to bring home. He’s
a tremendous role model and
a tremendous young man.

“And he’s going to be a
tremendous quarterback
when it’s all said and done.”

Burris’ success parallels
Temple’s passing efficiency,
as -the Owls’ passing offense
falls just short of the confer-
ence-leading Miami
Hurricanes’.

Also, Temple’s success in
the red zone (inside the
opponent’s 20-yard line),
indicates major improve-
ment. The Owls have con-
verted on 23 of 28 attempts
this season (82 percent) with
16 touchdowns and seven
field goals.

But there can not be an
effect without a cause. The

Johnstone, a man among boys

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

He’s the quarterback of the
Temple defense the
leader, the man in the mid-
dle, the one who makes the
defensive calls and terrifies
offenses.

At 6-foot-3-inches, 242
pounds, junior middle line-
backer Lance Johnstone has
become a premier athlete.

Considered the Owls’ top
defensive player, Johnstone
has been moved from the
outside to the middle to take
more advantage of his speed
and aggressiveness.

“He’s probably the best
athlete for us overall,”
Temple head coach Ron
Dickerson said.

The natural strength of
Johnstone, which includes a
600-pound squat and a 400-
pound bench press, com-
bined with his 4.5 speed, has
proven to be deadly -for
opposing offenses.

Although the junior line-
backer has not recorded any
sacks so far this year, he
leads the Temple defense in
tackles with 64, including a
team high 40 solo tackles.

Possibly the most amazing
statistic is Johnstone’s 24
tackles behind the line of
scrimmage for losses,
totalling 125 yards over a
two-year period.

with a friend, who was under
the influence of drugs.

Witnesses say the murderer
was high and simply came
out of the house and starting
shooting. The very next day,
he didn’t even know what he
had done, because he had
been so high that night.

“It wasn’t nothing I could
do,” Clark said. “My family
wouldn’t let me leave the
house. When they finally did,
I rode my bike around 20th
Street. Then I went around
[to] my cousin’s house. I
wasn’t even at the house for
an half an hour before his
family came and got me.
They wouldn’t let me out of
their sights at all.”

To make matters worse,
one month after Charles was
killed, Hayes received a call
from a friend, telling him
Terrence had been shot and
killed in a similar way.

brothers: he has used their
deaths as motivation. He was
one of six recipients of the
1994 N4A Achievement
Award, sponsored by the
National Association of
Academic Advisors. This
award honors student-ath-
letes who have overcome
personal, academic and/or
emotional odds to achieve
academic success while par-
ticipating in intercollegiate
sports and making a mean-
ingful contribution to their
community.

“Hayes is a leader on and

off the field,” said David‘

Gist, a close friend.
“Especially an emotional
leader. When somebody
needs something, you go to
Hayes. He’ll never turn any-
one down. He is nice like
that.”

Hayes’ leadership is also
visible in the football field,
as he leads by example.

“He makes plays that needs
to be made.” Pitt linebacker

Gerald Simpson said. “No
matter if it’s keeping a block-
er contained, making a tack-
le, rushing the quarterback to
make him throw the ball in
the hurry.”

So far this season, Clark is
ranked sixth on the team with
36 tackles.

Despite the current losing
streak, Clark has been a sym-
bol of motivation for the
younger players.

“He is a senior leader,” said
Pitt linebacker Jason Chavis.

“After a loss, he’ll say ‘Hey .

man, put it behind you.’ He’s
got to lighten people up.
Hayes is the type of person
that we revolve around. He
always has something to say.
Next year he will be a big
loss. We will miss Hayes.”

His teammates shouldn’t be
sad because of his departure.
This is because Clark’s life-
long dream is about to come
true, as he’ll graduate with a
degree in Liberal Studies in
May.

reason Dickerson decided to
attack the airways this sea-
son is Temple falls dead last
in rushing offense, with a
paltry 81.3 yards per game.

Adding to the Owls’ run-
ning woes, their leading
rusher and touchdown scorer
Danny Davis, who rushed for
263 yards and three touch-
downs, fractured his ankle
against Syracuse.

But Dickerson isn’t wor-
ried.

“We have plenty of backs,”
he said. “Running backs and
receivers are the areas we
have some depth in.”

Juan Gaddy and wide
receiver Damon Atwater will
assume Temple’s running
responsibilities.

Junior receiver Marc
Baxter has been the recipient
of Burris’ bombs.

Currently, he is seventh in
receptions per game (4) and
fourth in receiving yards
(65.6) in the conference.

But on the other side of the
ball, things aren’t so rosy for
the Owls.

With some pathetic defens-
es in the Big East, Temple
ranks on the bottom of
almost every defensive cate-
gory.

Temple yields 219 rushing
yards per game and allows
34.4 points a game, both last
in the conference.

An alarming note for
Temple is it will face the
conference’s leading rusher,
Billy West, who averages
107.6 yards a game.

The Owls rank third-to-

last in total defense, behind
Syracuse and Pitt, respective-
ly.
With both Temple and Pitt
in the midst of rebuilding,
the matchup will dictate the
construction status of the two
programs.

“I don’t know if it is so
much bragging rights,” Pitt
wide receiver Billy Davis
said...

“It’s just a matter of one
having to show the other how
much more improved they
are. The measuring stick is
going to be long and hard

Pitt fans found the comments
humorous, but apparently WVU
fans did not, evident from the
numerous complaints Pitt
received.

“I feel bad that people took
offense,” Ireland said. “And I
take full responsibility if they
did.”

This season was Ireland’s first
year of announcing Pitt football
games.

“I was a four-game rookie,”
he said.

He started at the the university
as the women’s basketball
announcer 10 years ago. He also
announces high school football
games in Allegheny County.

“I hold no grudges,” Ireland
said. “It’s all just a game. It’s not

East selection for the past
two years, the middle line-
backer is one to be consid-
ered for All—America honors
this year.

After seven games,
Johnstone has forced three
fumbles, recovered two of
them, and intercepted one
pass.

The man who has created
havoc in all facets of the
defensive game will one day
play in the National Football
League. '

I “He’s a big-league football

player and a tremendous
role model for our young
football team,” Dickerson
said.

In his first season playing
after he was redshirted his
freshman year in 1991,

20/20 man:

"We’ve Changed Our Name"

oun BIGGESLE EVER!

GUCCI HALSTON CHERYL TIEGS

 

Johnstone did not hold a
starting position but tied for
the Big East Conference
lead with nine quarterback
sacks.

After compiling 98 yards
in losses on 16 tackles, he
was named second—team All-
Big East. r

In his first year, Johnstone
totalled 74 tackles, which
ranked him fifth among
Temple tacklers and 18th
overall for defenders in the
conference.

Improving in skill and
increasing his minutes with
each year, the middle line-
backer entered 1993 as a
starter and the leader on the
Owl defense.

Starting at outside line-
backer for all 11 games, his
88 tackles led the team with

66 of them being solo, a

Temple record.

He also had four games
with 10 or more tackles.

His best game last season
came against Syracuse with
nine solo tackles, and he fin-
ished out the 1993 season
with eight solo and 10 total
tackles against the Panthers.

“He’s obviously our cap-
tain and a tremendous
leader,” Dickerson said.
“He’s an outstanding foot-
ball player.”

Johnstone’s success as an
athlete goes back to his high
school days.

Attending Germantown
High School in the
Philadelphia area, he helped
his football team win its
division in 1991.

Johnstone’s roots with

Temple go through his
father, who is a Temple
University lieutenant police
officer, and his younger
brother, Brent, is a true
freshman for the Owls.

The hard-hitting middle
linebacker will take his
position against the Panthers
