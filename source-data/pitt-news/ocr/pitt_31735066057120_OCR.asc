BAS and College Reublicans discuss
the pros and cons of a cultural center

By Beth Kovaly

Asst. News Editor

Black Action Society leaders rejected
College Republican claims that a Black
Cultural Center on campus will benefit only
African-American students.

B_AS Chair Keith Davis and Deputy Chair
Michael Barge met with CR President Kevin
Docherty yesterday after he heavily criti-

cized the need for the center in The Pitt «

News. .
Docherty’s critique came after Student
Government Board members passed a reso-

Provost Henderson declares  resignation

lution Monday night supporting the “idea
and establishment” of a Black Cultural
Center. A V

Davis said he called Docheity yesterday
afternoon and the three of them met for over
two hours. ’

“I don’t know whether the talk was any
good or not,” Davis said. “When you make
statements that are totally unfactual and

come from no base, I think you are just gen— ‘

erally angry.”
Dochexty had stated that a separate center

would stress differences and not similarities r

of students. Barge disagreed, saying

Docherty has a problem with a “black” cul-
tural center.

“He focuses on the adjective rather than
the idea,” Bargesaid. “Just because we use
the term ‘black’ that doesn’t mean it is the
‘anti-white’ cultural center.”

Davis agreed. “In no way will this be a
black union and a white union, but _a benefi-
cial component for all faculty, students and

‘staff. What we’re trying to build on campus

is a positive environment for all students.”
That positive environment, Davis said, will
include academic, cultural and social aspects

After a 23-year career at Pitt,
Provost Donald Henderson
announced his upcoming res-
ignation yesterday.

Henderson plans to immedi-

ately reduce his workload and
retire in August.

“I accept Donald’s resigna-
tion with understanding but
also with reluctance, both as
his colleague and friend,”
Chancellor J. 9 Dennis
O’Connor _said.

“In the past two years I have
continuously drawn on his
counsel and good judgement
as we have moved forward to
foster a more open, a more
accountable and a more acad-
emically robust university.”

Henderson was named asso-

ciate provost in 1970, after
receiving his Ph.D. in sociolo-
gy from Pitt three years earlier.
He was then named vice
provost in 1978 and provost in
1989. .

THE Pl'IT NEWS, Wedneﬂ, April 21, 1993 5

Pitt nursing students find job hunt difficult

By Julie Holaren
.S‘taﬁ' Writer

On her first day, one junior
nursing student had an experi-
ence she will never forget.

She was assigned to a hepatitis
B patient, a patient who also had
AIDS. He couldn’t walk, couldn’t
eat alone, had open sores all over
his body and could hardly speak.

“He barely weighed 90 pounds,
he couldn’t even go to the bath-
room by himself so a catheter was
used to strain un'ne_from his blad-
der. I had to do everything for him
physically and emotionally,” she
said.

Once, she was discarding the
catheter when urine dripped
through her nylon onto her leg.

“The first thing I thought was,
did I shave my legs this morning?”
Small cuts on the leg could allow
exposure to the AIDS virus.

Despite the risks, the student’s
main concern was for the patient.

“I was frustrated at times. I
couldn’t do much for him, but
what I could and did do con-
firmed that I had made the right
choice by wanting to be a nurse,”
she said.

Students at Pitt’s School of
Nursing experience similar unfor-
gettable situations almost every
day. Pitt’s nursing program is
doing what it can to prepare stu-
dents to deal with such critical sit-
uations, because at some point
this will be the students’ job.

Until recently, a person with a
nursing bachelor’s degree could
pick and choose because jobs

were plentiful.  the past, 80’per—
cent of graduating nursing stu-
dents at Pitt had jobs before grad-
uation. Now, just under 50 per-
cent have jobs.

The primary cause for this
decrease is because employers,
such as hospitals, have cut back
on hiring due to emphasis on
defraying health-care costs.

“Right now we are looking at a
health-care industry that’s tighten-
ing its belt. They know that there
are going to be curves in control
to help bring health-care costs
down,” said Cherie Remley, R.N.,
M.S.N. and student advisor at Pitt.

She said there are several rea-
sons jobs are tight. Over the past
few years many people went into
nursing because of the lack of
other jobs. At the same time, cost-
ly health care came into the fore-
front and the industry initiated a
hiring freeze.

“So, at a time when jobs were
decreasing, many nursing schools
were putting out more graduates,”
Remley said. “In this area, there’s
an abundance of nursing schools.”

This year, 112 students will
graduate with a bachelor in sci-
ence of nursing, B.S.N. Half of
them don’t have jobs yet.

Students accepted into Pitt’s
School of Nursing follow a strict
schedule. General education
requirements are on a, tirne-line
and must be met along with nurs-
ing requirements.

Introduction to professional
nursing teaches sophomore stu-
dents the role as a professional
nurse, the nursing process and

critical thinking and decision—mak-
ing.’

Sophomore students begin clin-
icals in local institutions one day a
week to get hands-on experience
working with healthy children and
senior citizens.

Junior students have clinicals
twice a week in area hospitals
where they receive individual
patient assignments and take on
the role of a nurse in real-life situa-
tions. Clinical practice is super-

- vised by clinical instructors and

involves putting nursing skills to
use while caring for the patient.
Clinicals are very small with one
instructor for every eight to 10 stu-
dents.

There are four clinical rotations,
seven weeks each, in which all
students receive patient assign-
ments. These assignments may
include nursing care for mothers,
newborns and families, clients

r with psychiatric mental health

problems and adults with medical
surgical problems.

Exposure to crucial situations
teaches students the necessity of
extreme caution when treating
patients.

“Every day you go home and
wonder, ‘Did I catch anything
today?” nursing junior Carissa
Gibson said.

As a senior, students serve one
day a week treating patients at
home and two days giving
advanced care to adults.

Students work side by side with
a registered nurse and often find
themselves working full-time:

Student opinions vary

on campus computers labs

The comments ranged from,
“It takes much too long for the
labs to file my printouts” to ‘We

In a recent computer lab sur-
vey of Pitt students conducted
on campus by Academic
Computing, sentiments were
almost evenly divided between
positive and negitive.

Damean Baiﬁeld, a ﬁrst—year

student, vocalized the concerns
of many of the surveyed stu-
dents.

“The hours of the computer

Barfreld said. “The labs should

Pitt's informaton science
program ranks high

ByBethE.Cochran
ForIbePittNews

The undergraduate program
in information science was
ranked fourth in the nation in
the most recent edition of the
Gourrnan Report: A Rating of
Undergraduate Programs in
American and International
Universities.

The Gourman Report identi-
fies the most effective schools in
over 162 ﬁelds by rating leading
institutions in each area.

Ida M. Flynn, director of the
undergraduate information sci-
ence program, said the faculty
and students had no idea they
were in the report.

“It was a total surprise. One

of our graduate students discov-
ered it. He came into the office
and said, ‘Hey, did you know
we’re in the Gourman Report?’
It was a shock,” Ida Flynn said

According to Ida Flynn, this is
the first year that the Gourman
Report rated information sci-
ence programs since few
schools had this kind of pro-
gram.

Flynn said her husband
Roger started the program in
1979 when he saw that more
and more businesses wanted
their employees to leam how to
use computers.

first coordinator of the under-
graduate program and is now a

Therapy

Continued from page 1
rape is group therapy.

“A group [of men accused of
raping] that sit in a room and
say ‘it wasn’t,OK and she
didn ’t ask for it,”’ Nelkins says.

Teaching men that it is not all
right to force or coerce their
date into having sex seems to
be the only therapy for men
who are not convicted rapists
or substance abusers, said
Barbara Weiner, Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape education
and training specialist.

Social services in Pittsburgh
only counsel convicted rapists,
according to Weiner.

Most say that the best treat-
ment for students who rape
seems to be education, not
therapy.

Bridget Guernsey said she
has seen a dramatic change
regarding male students’ atti-
tudes on sexual assault during
the nine years she was the
assistant director of Student
Activities in charge of fraterni-
ties and sororities.

“Before 1986 the awareness
was not there,” said Guernsey,
who was an assistant director
from 1983 to 1992.

The first sign of change came
in 1987, she said, when several
fraternity brothers complained
to her about a brother who was
harassing their female guests.

“A group of fraternity broth-
ers came to me and said, ‘We
have a brother, big_in stature,
drinks a lot, who will see a
petite woman, pick her up and

make her scream,”’ said
Guernsey, who now works at
Emery College in Atlanta, Ga.

The brothers, partly worried
that no women would come to
their parties, got their brother
counseling, Guernsey said.

Senior Derrick St. Clair, who
has been a Delta Tau Delta fra-
ternity brother since 1989, has
also seen aggressive behavior
toward women becoming less
and less tolerated.

“Over the past year and a
half there has been more con-
cern among the brothers for
girls that are wandering around
the house,” St. Clair said.

“In the past, [date rape] really
wasn’t discussed.”

As a student representative of
the Sexual Assault Task Force,
St. Clair said he hopes that
before he graduates in the fall,
female students can have a
social life and not worry about
being a rape victim.

“A girl has every right to stay
at a fraternity party after two,”
he said, referring to the belief
that if a girl stays late at a fra-
ternity house, she is asking for
it.

“Girls can’t blame them-
selves,” he said.

Education must focus, not
just on how women can avoid
being victims, but on how men
can avoid being rapists.

“Everybody focuses their
attention on women,” St. Clair
said. “It has to be for both
groups. Guys have to know if
they cross this line then it’s

rape.”

Over the past few years-,
some fraternity houses have
become classrooms for sexual
assault awareness.

Former Pitt student Nathan
Maclntosh, who graduated
from Pitt in 1987, still goes to
fraternity parties, not to social-
ize but to educate.

For the past year, he and
about 15 current and former
male college students have
been attending parties to pass
out date rape awareness
leaflets to both men and
women.

Maclntosh and his group,
who don’t have a name, target
men who think that an invita-
tion into a date’s room is an
invitation to sex.

“We tell them, that’s not the
green light. That’s friendship.”

Maclntosh said he and a
group of friends from other
‘local colleges got together
because they were tired of
being “looked down upon” as
rapists simply because they
were male.

St. Clair said he hopes to set
an example for younger broth-
ers that sexual aggression is not
normal behavior for a guy.

An example he said he
regrets never having.

“I hope the younger guys
will learn from our example.”

Jenny said that even though
the student who raped her
wasn’t punished for his crime,
she hopes he realizes he com-
mitted a crime.

three consecutive 12-hour shifts.

By the end of the semester the
student usually reverses roles with
the registered nurse.

‘‘It is a realistic preparation for
the real world,” nursing senior
Kristin Steier said. “The one thing
that sticks out in my mind is how
to pronounce a person brain
dead. Telling the family is the
hardest thing  the family’s reac-
tion was so unrealistic. They actu-
ally thought he would overcome
this, get up and walk right out of
the hospital.”

Because of Pittsburgh’s reputa-
tion of performing medical mira-
cles daily, the nursing school has
an advantage over other schools
because of the resources avail-
able. .

Duquesne University has many
of the same resources and uses
them to its advantage. Duquesne’s
nursing program is affiliated with
over 20 different hospitals. The
clinical experience and require-
ments are similar to those at Pitt.

professor inthe information sci-
ence department, said that Pitt was
one of the first schools to have
information science.

“We were kind of ahead of our
time. There were not enough
schools with information science
programs throughout the nation,
sothere was no need for a rank-

iing. But the ﬁeld has grown and
has finally become recognized,”
he said.

He also said the school puts a
great emphasis on a sound, broad-
based curriculum that concentrates
on the human factors of computer
science.

Ida Flynn said she feels strongly
that Pitt’s program ranked fourth in
the Gouiman Report because of
that curriculum.

“What makes Pitt’s program one
of the best is that it is concerned
with the end user, the human
being. Our courses teach students
to present information to the gen-
eral public so that they can use the
system,” she said.

She added that-the small size of
the program allows teachersto
give personal attention to their stu-
dents and said that most students
prefer smaller classes at a universi-
ty as large as Pitt

“Our curriculum is proven to be
what the students need when they
graduate. We take into account
thosepeople who have never
used computers before,” she said.
“We are concerned with how that
person is going to use the system
and not just the system itself.”

The Gourman Report uses cer-
tain criteria to evaluate schools in
each field, such as the age of the
school and the program; the quali-
fications and experience of the fac-
ulty; the quality of student’s
scholastic work and the standards
and quality instruction.

Other schools in the top five
were M.I.T., ranking first;
California, second; Michigan, third;
and Ohio State coming in behind
Pitt in fifth. Carnegie Mellon
University was ranked sixth.

paiison to Pitt, Temple requires 55
credits of prerequisites for the
nursing program and_it is a sepa-

approximately 30 general educa-

Junior nursing students at
Temple have clinicals twice a
week in surrounding area hospi-
tals, supervised by faculty mem-
bers, as well as theory courses.

Iast year, all graduating seniors
at Temple had jobs before gradu-
ation. Rita Lourie from the College

After graduation, students can
work as a Graduate Nurse (G.N.)

Chances to retake the exam are

cussing why she was not selected for tenure but
would not reveal the content of the letter.

Henderson also refused to say why he denied
Hoke’s tenure. T i

“I don’t want to talk about that,” he said yes-
terday.

According to the Student Bar Association
(SBA), this is the first time a provost has over-
turned a faculty vote to grant tenure.

“lPitt’s Law School] has a problem in retaining
quality women faculty. She is the third woman
lost this year,” said Christine Biancheria, law
student and chair of the investigating committee
on Hoke’s tenure process. ‘ .

Pitt has three baselines for the decision to
select people for tenure, according to the
university’s Appointment and Tenure Policies.
Applicants are expected to show achievement
in scholarship, effectiveness in teaching
and a commitment to service or academic citi-
zenship. _

The first task for the applicant is scholarship,
shown through the writing of two articles.
Professor Hoke has written _articles for the
Boston University Law Review and the
Connecticut Law Review.

In the second category, the applicant must
show effectiveness in teaching. Hoke has been
a member of Pitt’s law faculty since the fall of

1987. According to a faculty/course evaluation
compiled by the SBA, Hoke’s overall score
exceeded the average of the faculty as a whole.

The last criteria the Law School imposes
involves a commitment to service. Hoke has
served on numerous university and law school
committees and has lectured for groups such as
the Allegheny Bar Association and Women’s
Bar Association.

She has also given lectures on Pennsylvanizrs
Abortion Control ‘Act and spoke at an AIDS
Regional Education (and Training Center
Conference.

On completion of all prerequisites, a vote
was cast in January 1992 where all members of
the Law School’s tenured faculty voted by
secret ballot on Hoke’s and other applicants’
tenure.

Hoke received the needed votes to be recom-
mended for tenure. The SBA reports claims one
or more tenured faculty members communicat-
ed with the provost and attempted to dissuade
him from granting Hoke’s tenure.

SBA’s report says the decision to not grant
tenure will have a very big impact on the Law
School. It willaffect the current nontenured fac-
ulty and the futurenontenured faculty.

“The university and Hoke need to work out a
settlement,” said Jules Lobel, a tenured Law
School professor.

to improve retention rates of
African-American students on
campus.

Docherty had questioned
whether the center would be
able to improve minority reten-
tion rates and how that improve-
ment could be measured.

Davis said that BAS has stud-
ied other institutions with cultur-
al centers, including Penn State
and the University of Cincinnati.

“They have succeeded not
only in providing for the social
aspect of students, but retention
rates for African-American stu-
dents have improved on every
level,” he said.

“You can meet people of like
minds, you can tap into cultural
events anexperience that is right
there and readily accessible.” .

Davis said that the SGB resolu- A

tion was a strong sign of support
for the project, which already
has Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s interest.

“It shows that there is a gamut
of student support for this pro-
ject that crosses ‘the racial

boundaries we often see on this
campus,” Davis said.

Davis and Barge agreed that
the project will take much more
than student commitment.

“We are asking for an under-
standing on what is happening,”
Davis said. “We are willing to
educate. If you have a problem
with the concept and you don’t
know what the concept is all
about, you need to learn about
it.”

“It is very apparent that
lDochertyl has not learned any-
thing about it because he has
made an ass of himself in the
paper,” Davis said.

Docherty had also questioned

A where the funding for the center

would come from. o
“That’s all Docherty was con-
cerned about —- money,” Barge

‘said. “I-‘Ie wasn't concerned

about retention rates of minority
students. It was all a matter of
money.”

Davis said the actual funding
for the center has not been
determined yet but that the
money would not come from

student tuition.

“Docherty has failed to
acknowledge any of the needs
and concerns of African-
American students on this cam-
pus,” Davis continued. “In turn,
he is counter-productive to the
progression of African-American
students.

Davis also criticized SGB
member T om Grassia for debat-
ing the wording of the resolu-
tion. Grassia had questioned
what Pitt’s African-American
retention rates were in compari-
son with other universities.

“We have a problem,” Davis
said. “We don’t have a 100-per-
cent retention rate of African-
American students.

Davis said that he does not see

Docherty’s criticism as one also
held by the College Republicans
but as an individual one.
- “Grassia and Docherty, those
type of people need to make it
clear where they stand so that
you can either be an enemy or
an ally, and I think it is very
clear where we see them,” Davis
said. " - 

Labs

to complain of the close quarters
and unavailability of terminals.

“I know it’s a source of irrita-
tion, but it’s a situation where
there’s nothing we can do,” said
Dan Temple, director of
Academic Computing. Aside
from knocking out the walls,
Temple said that they have done
everything possible to alleviate
the troubles at Lawrence.

Most common were com-
ments concerning the perfor-
mance and attitudes of lab oper-
ators. Many voiced concern that
labs are not properly staffed.

“They [the consultants] don’t
know any more than I do,” one
student commented in the sur-
vey. Another student comment-
ed, “The labs are staffed with
really good people. They’re
friendly and very helpful."

Dennis Lippert, an operator at
the new Sutherland lab, said,
“We have the choice between
answering questions and ﬁling
output. Unless you put more
people out there, there’s no

other way to do it”

As for the accusation that lab
workers are not helpful, Lippert
said, “If they’re working on a
program and are having trouble
getting it running, that’s not real-
ly our 

According to Academic
Computing, the diversity of com-
pliments and complaints sug-
gests that while many consul-
tants are doing their job well oth-
ers must not be. -

Temple said that the survey
results will lead them to better
train the consultants and keep a ’
closer eye on their performance.

Academic Computing stressed
that students are not aware of
the many services provided by
Computing and Information
Services computing labs
and encouraged users to
respond with comments
and complaints through elec-
tronic mail or suggestion
cards. They are also planning to
establish a network to help keep
professors informed of lab
changes.

Holocaust victims

A Roper Organization survey of nearly 1,000 adults and 500 hundred
students showed that one-third of all Americans are open to the possibil-
ity that the Holocaust never happened. Twenty-two percent of those
who answered said it seems possible that the Holocaust never hap-
pened and 12 percent said they did not know whether it was possible or
impossible.

Elie Vﬁesel, a Nobel laureate who spent time in the Auschwitz and
Buchenwald concentration camps, expressed his disbelief at the sheer
terror of the numbers. The thought and pictures of lamp shades made of
human skin, bodies piled up like trash in a dumpster and paper-thin
human beings are becoming horridly insignificant. Hopefully, the
Holocaust Memorial Museum, opening Thursday in Washington, will
permanently ingrain these pictures into the minds of Americans as well
as the rest of the world.

‘ Many Americans will point to a number of factors contributing to
these numbers. Among them will be: the rise of Naziism among our
nation's youth, a faulty educational system and the decreasing number
of surviving Holocaust victims.

. However, more important than any of those other explanations is the
failure of the United Nations, European Community and the United
States to respond to ethnic cleansing throughout the world From Bosnia
to Cambodia to Afghanistan, races are being exterrninated as our
nations’ leaders virtually ignore them. When they do pay attention,
Margaret Thatcher for example, current leaders like Secretary of State
Warren Christopher dismiss them as outbreaks of emotion.

As if emotion is an improper response in this situation anyway.

We will admit that there is absolutely no excuse for this ignorance. But
if our own leaders ignore what is going on around the world, how can
their constituents be expected to remember as well?

The FBI and media pander to power

Those in control manipulate their way through the world

This letter is in response to
Leon Fuksman’s editorial
regarding the New York City
bombing. (The Pitt News,
March 22.)

It is nice to know that The
Pitt News has been successful-
ly influenced and “fixed” to
be part of the mainstream
conditioning machine of the
media. Let’s see now, how
does the plasticized “reality”
report fit for public consump-
tion continue? Something like,
America is no longer a safe
haven as terrorists strike at
the World Trade Center, wait
a minute —— this “story”
doesn’t leave me satisfied, it is
simple enough, those nasty
old terrorists are at it again.
Well, the authorities must be
fast on the track with some-
thing digestible for the public.
OK, this is good; swift work
by the FBI wrapped this one
up with apprehension of Arab
suspects. Please, give me a
break. Check out the CIA’s
record of deeds!

If you (The Pitt News) pro-
fess to desire peace and non-
violence, why not demon-
strate the courage to stop
pandering for the power of
people in America with their
privilege of hypocrisy, contra-
dictions and double stan-
dards?

Aside from our diet of tele-
vision decadence that we’re
fed daily, we are also partici-
pants in that grand national
game of “what’s the truth”
about everything.

I’m puzzled at the alarm
expressed over North Korea’s
nuclear aspirations while it’s
just the status quo pertaining
to war-like Israel’s possession
of the bomb and to whom we
can look for involvement in
South Africa having devel-
oped nuclear weapons?

Why not get to the heart of
the strife and violence plagu-
ing much of the world by

declaring one formidable
cause, the American and
Israeli manipulation, domina-
tion and suppression of other
people to sustain dispropor-
tional profit? Give me the
cause!

ical and promote fairness in

capitalism!

LETTERS

Godcreated Amoebas

I would like to ask the
question, why is the notion
that God created the earth
such an outrageous idea?
Today, in public and private
schools across the nation, citi-
zens are taught that the begin-
ning of the earth started with
an amoeba and a couple of
other things floating around
in a vast ocean. This theory
has been studied and biologi-
cally tested to be correct.

The argument that so many
ordinary people and scholars,
including my political science
teacher, use against creation
is the same argument that can
be used against evolution.
The thinking is that it is illogi-
cal and unscientific to think
that some God decided one
day to create the earth, with
its rivers, mountains and
humans. People do not like
to believe something super-
natural can happen, and
therefore, they develop a sci-
entific explanation for what-
ever they cannot explain.

My argument is to use the
same line of logic to disman-

tle the argument for evolu-
tion. If those amoebas and
other things are indeed the
beginning of life, how did
those organisms get there? It
must be realized that at some
point in time a supernatural
experience had to occur,
where the amoeba were
placed in the seas.

This article is to point out
the inaccurate action of
schools to remove the teach-
ing of creation, because the
idea that removed creation
from schools, is the same idea
that can be used to remove
evolution.

“Chris Webber victimized
by the media;” please spare
us, Mr. Pugliese, your petty
attempt to link racial issues to
sports. You of all people
should know that today's
media thrive on sensational-
ism. Chris Webber wasn’t vili-
fred by the media, he was glo-
rified by it. They (the media)
have painted Webber as a
cocky, arrogant punk because
he is one — on the basketball
court. And there's nothing
wrong with that; that’s his
game and he plays it well. He
and his teammates have taken
the basketball world by storm
in two short years. Their style
and attitude was loved and
hated alike throughout the
basketball world.

The media created this
monster of hype to sell the
story — not to spread racial
stereotypes. Your cry of hid-
den racism perpetrated by the
media is ludicrous and poorly
formulated. But, then again,
this is The Pitt News, not The
New Yorle Times.

search for, a permanent
provost.

“I am pleased that Mark
Nordenberg, an accomplished
acknowledged academic leader
and legal scholarfwill assume
the duties of interim provost on
Sept. 1, 1993,” O’Connor said.

“For the past eight years
Mark has guided the Law
School with clear vision and
remarkable leadership, and the
school now ranks among the
finest in the country in both
teaching and scholarship.”

Henderson is currently under
fire for his decision to deny
tenure to Law School Professor
Candice Hoke, who filed sex
discrimination charges against
Pitt last Week.

Monday’s rally to protest this
decision targeted Henderson,
as law students, faculty and

others waved ‘signs on the-

Cathedral lawn.

Despite the recent problems,
O’Connor said he has found
Henderson to be an excellent
administrator.

“When I first arrived here in
the summer of 1991, it was a

tremendous blessing to have‘

such a talented and thoughtful
administrator as Don
Henderson providing invalu-
able assistance during a time of
transition and new begin-
nings,” O’Connor said.

No miracles for Broo/es
as Pens pummel Dez/_z'ls

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

Do you believe in miracles?

A group of inexperienced

amateurs under the tutelage

of Herb Brooks made the

world believe in them as

Team USA knocked off the

hockey machine of the Soviet

Union on the way to winning

a gold medal in the 1980
Olympics.

Now,

15 years

later, Brooks

needs anoth-

er miracle as

his New

Jersey Devils

face a Penguin team that is

‘ dominating the NHL as few

teams ever have in the first
round of the playoffs.

After game two, it seems
one miracle is Brooks’ allot-
ment for this lifetime.

The Devils put up a fight
for about half of the first peri-
od last night before the
Penguins rolled right over
them on the way to a 7-0
pummelling to take a 2-0 lead
in the series.

Some of the numbers show
how dominant the Pens were.
They scored seven goals

while top scorer Mario
Lemieux scored only one
point —- a shorthanded goal
in the first period. Tom
Barrasso stopped 56 shots on
the way to his third career
shutoutin playoff competi-
tion but did not have a great
game being challenged only
in spurts early and late in the
game.

Six different Penguins
scored goals with Shawn
McEachern chipping in two.
Ron Francis dished out four
assists.

The Devils controlled play
early, but Barrasso came up
with enough big saves to
keep the game scoreless.
Francis used his pet move,
fake the shot and fire a pass
to team mate cutting to the
net, to perfection as he found
McEachern to open the scor-
ing at the 15:09 mark of the
first period.

Just under three minutes
later, Lemieux did his only
damageto stretch the lead to
2-0. He took a Ulf Samuelsson
pass off the side boards,
charged in with Devil
defenseman Bruce Driver
hanging on his back, decked
once and chipped a shot on

With Posse boss Mark Jones off
covering the NHL playoffs for ESPN
and ABC, someone’s gotta pick up
the slack of covering all the pre-
playoff foreplay that encompasses
the monster of all drawn-out playolf
toumeys —- the NBA playoffs.

But before we randomly prop
and knock the 16 respective con-
tenders and pretenders that qualify
for the second season, let’s take a
timeout for some regular season
honors: Most Valuable Player,
Rookie ofthe Year and Coach of the
Year.

MVP:

BG’S CHOICE —— Charles

Barlrley, Phoenix Suns.

Inaseasonbn'mmingwithlegiti-
rnatecontenders—-Houstoncenter

I Hakeem Olajuwon, Chicago end—all

Michael Jordan and the Knicks’
Patrick Ewing —— it’s appropriate
that the eternal brlde’s maid tops the
list of mega stars for his first MVP
trophy.

While Houston Rockets’ center
Hakeem Olajuwon has the most
impressive across-the-board stat
sheet in the league (25.9 points per
game, 13 rebounds per game, 4.1
blocks per gme), Barkley owns the
moniker of best player on the best
team (Phoenix is 60-19 thru
Tuesday night).

Barkley’s numbers are typically
top—sheIf -—— 26.0 ppg, 12.4 ppg, 5.1
assists per game and 52 percent
shooting from the ﬁeld make for a
decent year at the oﬂice. But what
separates Mr. Big Bad Bald ﬁorn the

immeasurable presence he has
exuded on his new squad

that Phoenix racked up so many
injuries this year, it was once consid-
ering changing its unis agin —— to

Sure, he’s got a better supporting
cast than M] and Hakeem (Ewings
teammates are on par with the Suns’
supporting cast), but the sheer fact
that Barkley has elevated a very

NBA’s best reguIar—season team of
1992-93 ~ says it all.

PUGS’ CHOICE — Charles
Barkley, Phoenix Suns.

Frnally.Thishasbeenalongtime'

coming There is no denying that Sir
Charies gets the call this time. Others
have posted glorious seasons, but to
putitsimply— ifs Charles’ year. He
has owned the basketball world
since his June trade from
Philadelphia. He was the best player
at the Olympics last surmner and

has not slowed down since, bring-
ing his intensity-saturated, power-
dunking, blue-collar game to the
serenity of the Arizona desert.

Speaking of serenity — that
peaceful silence you hear is coming
fromhisdetractors.Yeah, afeware
whining about the great supporting
casthehasinPhoer1i)r.Buttlieseare
the same morons who said “yeah
he’s great, but the Sixers don’t 
when Charles played with lesser
squads in Philly.

And speaking of supponing casts,
last time I checked Phoenix had
more key injuries than anybody in
the league this sason. All-stars pre-
sent and future — KJ. missed 31
games and Richard Dumas 34
games. Cedric Ceballos, Oliver
Miller and Tom Chambers also did
signiﬁcant time on the injured
reserve. Bottom line — yes,
Phoenix has more all-around talent
than any team in the league but
Barkley raises it to a new level.

Phoenix won 53 games last sea-
son with no major injuries. They’ll
win 10 more than that this year with
perpetual injuries. Reason: Sir
Charles — the Godzilla-taker, death-
breaker, bald-headed Air-Max-

wearing shake ‘n’ baker. He ﬂat out
carried them early and won them
countless big games down the
stretch. Remember that old cliché
about making everyone around you
better —— insert that right here.

Barkley has injected so much atti-
tude into his new team that the
Suns are now one of the most
intense and angry crews anywhere.
Charles is doing it all, scoring on
double-teams, on the blocks, drain-
ing long jumpers, boarding, swat-
ting and still handling with unbeliev-
able grace for a power forward.
He’s made more breathtaking coast-
tocoast rushes this season than any-
body in the last four or ﬁve years.
He leads the league with six triple-
doubles.

Charles’ season is reminiscent of
the amazing year he had back in
‘89-’90. Rejuvenation is the reason

Lucanie

Continued from page 9
year is hardly considered regu-
lar. But the junior outside hitter
still has a lot more than her vol-
leyball talents.

“I have a lot more qualities
than volleyball,” Lucanie said. “I
like to have fun. Off the court,
I’m carefree.

“I’m an easy person to get
along with. People think you
are a snob just because you are
so good.”

The opposite is true on and
off the volleyball court. This
year, on the court, was a vivid
learning experience as well as a
very frustrating one.

Losing six seniors after the
1991 season, four first-year
players were thrust into starting
roles.

The weight of Pitt’s youthful
1992 season looked as if it

rested on the shoulders of,

Lucanie.

“With such young players,
they are often inexperienced at
the collegiate level,” Lucanie

I said. “The level of competition

is often overwhelming.”

The competition became too
much back in early September.
Pitt lost three straight matches in
the Miami-Ohio Tournament
and inconsistency was the main
problem. The Panthers hit rock
bottom later in the month when
they lost to Villanova, giving
head coach Sue Woodstra her
first Big East loss ever.

“I really had a good match
[against Villanoval,” Lucanie
said. “I was really frustrated. I
sa..is1;.,.7.S.<2n2s.s2r.2e .1125. .80:  tum
thisaround.’ Thatis when I
started playing with more drive
and incentive.”

The drive and incentive fil-
tered down to the first-year
players, but it was a constant
communication line that pulled
the Pittvolleyball team out of
this tailspin.» ' ' .

_“The upperclassmen were

frustrated and-‘the first-year,

p1ayers"thou”ght it was their

_ .-l----.-4.---....-.v..\-;-..‘-...

fault,” Lucanie said. “We had to
keep the communication open.

“Being the team captain, we
had a lot of meetings to work
out any problems, any concerns
or feelings.”

Relating -personally to the
newcomers, Lucanie and
sophomore setter Annie
Memagh helped ease the pres-
sure off the rookies experienc-
ing college for the first time.

“Being there for the first-year
players [was the key to the
team's improvementl,” Lucanie
said. “Supporting them on and
off the court, they are dealing
with pressures only first-year
students deal with. I wanted to
initiate a relaxed atmosphere. I
told them ‘It’s OK to do this.”’

Coach.Woodstra agreed.

“She made the younger kids
feel as comfortable as possible,”
Woodstra said. “And she

wouldn't be negative. She never
made the others feel like they
were not part of the team.

“As the only upperclassman,
they looked to her for guide-
lines. She’s a very good role
model.” ’

Lucanie said she did her best
to uphold that status.

“I thought I was the one who
had to get things going,”
Lucanie said. “I had to calm
down because I was very frus-
trated. But [the first-year play-
ers’] performance and involve-
ment took a lot of pressure off
of me.”

With this pressure eased,
Lucanie had a tremendous year.
Averaging a career high of 4.8
kills per game, Lucanie also had
more total kills in ‘92 than any
previous year with 518. She had
a solid hitting percentage of
.313, another career high; _

accessories to fill your computing

needs. Surge protectors, mouse pads,

diskettes and software products from

Don't miss this opportunity!

But through all the stats and
helping the first-year players,
the past year was tough on this
year’s Athlete of the Year.

“Sometimes I questioned
myself, ‘Was I being a good
captain?”’ Lucanie said. “I was
frustrated and feeling a little
guilty.

“But as the season ended
[with first-round match against
second-ranked Stanford in the
NCAA Tournament] and our
chances of winning were slim,
we said, ‘So what, we’re playing
this team, upsets can happen.”

With that attitude, the Pitt vol-
leyball team came full circle. An
inconsistent team in the begin-
ning of the season was now a
confident, cohesive unit at the
end.

“At the end things got back
on track,” Lucanie said. “Once

the spark got going, we kept it

going.”

Lucanie obviously meant a lot
to the Pitt volleyball team on the
court but it could be justified to

' say that in 1992 she meant more

to the young Panthers off the
court. The person inside was
more than just the volleyball
player many “fans” know.

Lucanie wants people to
know who she really is, not just
“the volleyball player for Pitt.”

“I would rather have a coach
say, ‘Am, you had a good game
today,”' Lucanie said. “It is more
personal than having someone
who doesn’t know you give you
an award.” ‘

Or in this case, saying, “Hey
aren’t you that volleyball play-
er?”

Well Pitt, say hello to Ann
Marie Lucanie the person who
happens to be our Athlete of the
Year.

With the spry blond engineering
the offensive attack, the Panthers
surged to surprising second-
place finish in the Big East
Conference standings (5-2-1) and
earned the team a trip to the
league’s Final Four
Championships.

As he did in his rookie season
in Oakland, “Prexy” led the
Panthers in scoring — this time
tallying 28 points on 10 goals and
eight assists. He also led the
Panthers with three game-win-
ning goals. Prex’s two—year total
of 17 goals put him on pace to
match the Panthers’ career goals
record of 35, held by current Pitt
head coach Joe Luxbacher. His
two-year point total stands at 45.

Prex was named to the A11-
Mid-Atlantic Region team follow-
ing the 1992 season.

Jeff Kloiber — The rugged
junior from Allentown, Pa., blos-
somed into an All-American in
1993 while helping to lift the
Panthers to their second consec-
utive Top 25 finish in the dual-
meet rankings.

With the Pitt wrestling team
dominated by youth this season,
Kloiber was called upon to step it
up. And he did, again displaying

the brilliance he had ﬂashed as

both a rookie and as a sopho-
more. Wrestling in the 190-
pound weight class, Kloiber
posted a 30-14 mark and earned
a wildcard selection to the NCAA
Championships in Iowa City. I
Once there, Kloiber made the
most of his opportunity, winning
five matches en route to a

‘tremendous fifth-place finish.

Among his victims at nationals
were Eastern Wrestling League
rival Dale Budd of Lock Haven,

_eighth—seeded Dave Malecek of

Northern Iowa and seventh-
seeded Dan Troupe of Iowa
State.

Jonna Huemrich stands_as the
shining example of potential
realized at Fitzgerald Field
House. Her 18.0 points and 8.6
rebounds per game are outstand-
ing to say the least, but to see her
play — to see her scratch and
fight -—— is to watch intensity per-
sonified.

“jonna is a vicious competitor
— she wants to do well so badly
that she’d wiling to do anything
to get it,” Pitt head coach Kirk
Bruce said. “She has developed
the confidence in her abilities
and tl1at’s the thing that has
helped her get to the point
where she is now — one of the
top five players in [the Big Eastl.”

Huemrich ended her 1992
junior campaign as an All-Big
East selection at a forward posi-
tion.

She recorded game-high marks
in both scoring and rebounding
10 times for Pitt and recorded
games of 20 points or better nine
times —- including notching 27
points in the season opener at
Duquesne, 25 against national
powerhouse . Penn State and
28 against Big East foe
Georgetown. A

Genaro Severino -—— Senior
gymnast Severino was another
Panther All-American. Severino
won the Eastern Regionals in the
vault three weeks ago. His score
of 9.3725. at the NCAA Division I
finals this past weekend was
good enough for fourth place in
a field that included three mem-
bers of 1992 Olympians. The top
six finishers are All-Americans.

The Panther men’s gymnastics
team hadn’t had an All-American
since Jorge Sanchez achieved the,
honor on the ﬂoor exercises in
1987.

Severino won the all-around
championship at the ECACs earli-
er this season. He was also the
first Pitt gymnast to win the

Joe Luxbacher — In his ninth
season as head coach of the Pitt

the Panthers to their finest season
in school history (12-6-1).
Working with a nucleus of young
but untested players. Luxbacher
guided the Panthers to a 5-2-1
mark in Big East play -—— good for
second place in the final league

A firm-handed tactician,
Luxbacher molded a talented
rookie class, which included
goalie Adam Spitzer, midfielder
j.L. Gorsin and forward Dean
Astorino, with talented vets like
Scott Alexander, ‘].R. Perdue and
Brian Pellegrino, producing a

Branded as cellar dwellers in

for the rest of the century. He’s that
good And that marketable.

In the easiest pick of the trifecta,
O’Neal wins the hands—down
Rookie of the Year in the year ofthe
yungsta. With regards to Charlotte
monster Alonzo Mourning,
Washington’s Tom Gugliotta and
the Wolves’ Christian Laettner,
O’Nealistherealestofrealdeals—
able to intimidate, and manhandle
and outrnuscle and outhustle you
—— all in one move.

When mega—arrogant, mega-
proud (and with good reason) Hall
of Famer Wilt Chamberlain goes so
farastosaythatshaqcanbebetter
than his Big Dipper self, you have to
stand up and take notice of “His
Shaqness” — in case you’ve been in
a coma the past six months.

PUGS’ CHOICE — Shaquille
O’Neal, Orlando Magic.

An easy pick, right? Not really.

Serious consideration was given to
Alonzo Mourning, who at this point
is a much more polished and
mature player than the Shaq Daddy.
Nonetheless, O’ Neal is the choice,
making the biggest impact of any
rookie since Michael Jordan in ‘85.

His power game is unquestion-
able as is his charisma and populari-
ty. Induetirne,Shaqneedstoadda
nice 15-foot jumper offensively and
better footwork defensively. But
what do you want from a 20-year-
old’ He’s already an All-Star, one of
the elite ﬁve centers in the world,
and the centerpiece to an ebbing
Magic franchise. Even with all his
oifense coming ﬁom 10—feet and in,
23.5 points, 13.7 boards and 3.6
blocks is unbelievable.

As much as Mourning is a man,
he has one of the lmgues 10 best
players in Iarryjohnson and anoth-
er all-star caliber player in Kendall
Gill at his side. -Shaq-Fu has only

Nick Anderson and a sometimes-
healthy and sometirnes-effective
Dennis Scott That and a lotta maxa-
goofability. He’s glad to see the
frown on your grill when he’s
drilling. The next Wilt — well,
maybe. The 1993 Rookie of the
Year — definitely.

Topooachz

BG’S CHOICE — George Karl,
Seattle Supersonics.

The loon leading the loons.

George and the hoop brats.

Disaster waiting to happen.

When hothead head coach
George Karl arrived on the Emerald
City scene two summers ago, that’s
the way most NBA insiders charac-
terized the irnpending relationship

between the high—octane retread‘

coach and the anything-but-sane

Supersonics’ squad. With problem I

talents Sean Kemp and Derrick
McKey hanging in the city of rain,
most thought it would be a matter

of months if not days until someone
—— either players, coach or both —
would go  Didn’t happen.

Instead, Shaler native Karl side-
steps the hysterics, laid down some
palatable discipline and feel-good
encouragement and led the Sonics
to the ﬁﬁh—best record in the NBA
(53-26 thru Tuesday). Led by a
defensive—minded guard combo
(Rickey Pierce, Gary Payton, Nate
McMillan and Dana Banos), Seattle
is primed for a legitimate run at the
NBA title, likely to meet Phoenix for
the Western Conference crown

Karl’s above—the-board efforts to
direct the Sonics rate him a step
ahead of two other worthy candi-
dates, Houston’s Rudy Tomjanovich
and New York’s Pat Riley.

PUGS’ CHOICE
Westphal, Phoenix Suns.

Paul Westphal likes Bob Dylan.
He loves Charles Barkley. What he’s
loving even more is the hard rain of

Paul

success that has fallen on him after
inheriting this star—studded cast led
by four veterans starving for an NBA
championship.

A rookie coach handling Barkley,
K.J., Danny Ainge and Tom
Chambers? Westphal has done
much more than merely handle the
troops. The Suns, complete with six
new faces, have dominated from
November on and without one
stitch of controversy or incohesive—
ness. Somehow, despite weekly
lineup changes, Westphal’s bunch
gelled shortly after Thanksgiving.
He runs a loose ship, letting the vets
have an occasional day off from
practice when they need it, yet still
gets production out of young play-
ers like Miller, Dumas and Ceballos.

Pat Riley and George Karl merit
serious consideration as well, but it
was tough to pick against a man
who had every reason to fail and

still won 60-plus games.

Pens

Continued from page 9
the backhand over fallen New
Jersey goalie Chris Terreri_ to
close the first period scoring.

Just as in game one, the
Pens settled the issue with an
explosive second period. For
goal number three, Rick
Tocchet took a pass from
Kevin Stevens, faked
Viacheslav Fetisov out of his
skates and bounced the puck
by Terreri.

After Terreri stuffed Jaromir
Jagr on a break away, the
power play clicked for goal
number four. Jagr redeemed
himself by charging out of the
corner and blasting a wrist
shot off the chest of Terreri
and into the net. .

Stevens continued the bar-
rage on another power play
by tipping a perfect Francis
pass in from right in front of
the goal. McEachern and Jeff
Daniels worked a perfect
give-and-go for the sixth goal
with Daniels getting the assist
and McEachern pushing it
home.

Relief came for Terreri‘ as
the third period opened, and
he. was replaced by Craig
Billington. The Pens took
only four shots, one of them a
bullet that Joe Mullen fired
home from the top of the
