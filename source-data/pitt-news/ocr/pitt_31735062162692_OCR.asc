Tickets On«Sale

Tickets for the Christmas Ball,
sponsored’ by Men’s Council, are
now on sale at the Student Desk
in the Cathedral, the School of
the Health Professions, and the
Student Union desk. ' V

Advance prices are $2.50 per
ticket and $2.25 each when sold
in blocks of ten or more. Tickets
will be sold, at the door for $2.75.

Men’s Council President Ray
Rowney has announced that the
Bill LeRoy Orchestra will provide
the music for the; dance. The
group consists of 11 musicians and
a vocalist.

Contrary to previous‘ an-
nouncements, the art exhibitions-
will deﬁnitely remain in the_
Commons Room for the Christ-
mas ‘Ball. Also, aséin past years,
there will be several Christmas
trees in the Commons Room
rather than one large tree. Offi-

cials have stated that ,it would
be impossible to bring a 30 or
40 foot tree through the-exist-
ing entrances to the Commons
Room.

Council has suggested that ta-
bles could be placed in the cor-
ridors surrounding the Commons
Room on the first and second
ﬂoors, overlooking the dance ﬂoor.
However, no deﬁnite arrange-
ments will be made until approvel

. of the plan has been given by uni-

versity otﬁcials.

Concerning "the blazer situation,
Dr. Swarts, the M.C. advisor, has
revealed that Marvin’s currently
has a supply of Pitt seals, but re-
fuses to sell them to those students

3 who bought their blazers else-

where. The main problem is still
to release Leftee’s from the con-
tract without ﬁnancial loss. and
give complete control to Marvin’s.

Finally, the ﬁnal draft of,the
Men’s Council constitution was
presentedat the meeting and was

For Discussion

The future location of fraterni-
ties and the possibility of a fra-
ternity row will be discussed to-
morrow night at 8 p.m. in the
Supper Room of the Student.
Union.

All presidents and faculty and
alumni advisers of fraternities
plus the presidents of the holding

houses will attend the meeting.

At present 16 of the 19 fraterni-
ties have "their own houses. These,
however, are located as far as
part of Center Avenue, Melwood
Street and Wallingford Street.
The idea of ,a fraternity row has
been discussed here for many
and recently has been
thought of as a realistic and dis-
tinct probability. _

Cleland, chairman, described Wi-6
dick as. an “intellectual factory
_.;worker.” He works on the assem-
“bly' line of the Chrysler plant in
Detroit. “Although he has held
gh union posts, he always re-
urns to work with the men in the

 
  
   
   
 
  
   
  
  
   
 
  
 
    
  
 
  
    
      
   
   
    
  
 
   
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
   
 
 
  
  
  

His main point was that_ Labor
ust rise above present problems
and contribute as it should to the
gﬁnerlcan society. “Most unions
would not tolerate me,” he re-
marked,” because I’m basically a
dolgooder who believes in social
 responsibility.”

:_' Widick claims that most peo-
',pI’e think of Labor in three im-
ages. The first is Jimmy Hoffa,
who “stands for corruption at its
height.” David McDonald. is the
' second. Widick pointed out that
_McDonald is not the average
Jjstcelworker, since 40 per cent
ot’steelworkers are underpaid.
f The third labor image is Walter
Reuther, the do-gooder of Amer-
ican labor. “He is honest, full of
tegrity, and ambitious, but does
ot represent the auto workers,
not the labor leaders.

, In his speech Widick stressed

that automation is a major pro-
blem. He cited the fact that in the
Chrysler plant 2300 out of 3000
workers were laid off because of
automation. Labor ‘believes in
automation and technological pro-
gress, but Widick feels that auto
workers‘should not have to bear
jthe brunt.

The only thing that can defeat

’_ labor, according to Widick, is

- totalitarianism.

 Mr‘. Widick to me is a fine ex-
ample of American democracy.
<1-Ie’s able to criticize something of
{which he is a part for the purpose
of its eventual success.

"Frank Carver to the athletic directorship of the university.

The new A.D. knowsthe university’s athletic depart-

should not be considered merely a promotion from his

What Price Education?

By David Breakstone

When the Russians sent their; first Sputnik into
space in October, 1957, there was considerable
public furor. One of the few tangible results of
that transitory .concern for the Soviet scientiﬁc
accomplishment was the draft-  ,7
ing of the National Defense Edu-  I
cation Act, passedlast year. in.

By its very nature a crash 
program to shore up the sagging  '1
educational system and to adapt .
to the areas, in which the -Rus- 

a variety of provisions for col- ¢
leges, teachers, and students.

One of the aids to the college V
student is a loan fund. There was 
some discussion, while the act , -' _
was in the works, of outright grants to capable stu-
dents, but the legislators decided that the govern-
ment was running too many giveaway shows as it
was. The loans are directed at potential school
teachers and superior students of science, and
language. '

The catch in the proposition is that the borrower
must ﬁle an oath of allegiance to the United States
and a “disclaimer” aiﬁdavit stating that he “does

not believe in, andvisv not a member of and does
not support any organization that believes in or

 

‘teaches, the overthrow of the U. S. government by

force or"violence or by any illegal" or unconsti-
tutional . methods.”

. The “disclaimer” afﬁdavit is the disturbing half

- - . V , , _ ‘ ‘ of the requirement. The" inescapable implication.

.”display in the foyer outside the Student Union cafeteria, is '
‘ the latest art exhibition at the university. Other works on
display include the Nicholas Lockoff -Collection of Recon-
- structions of Italian Masterpieces and French tapestries,
 which are representative of a national French art.’ ii '
i V The Lochoff works decorate part of the Forbes Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard sides of the Commons’ Room while
the tapestries are strung around a column in the middle of

must be required to avow their faith to the cause.
At the same time businessmen and farmers get mil-

lions of federal dollars without any pledge of -

loyatty. Theoath is a clear, if not black and white,

infringement of freedom of thought, making every.

borrower consciously —-aware that his bondsman is
playing big brother,'too. ' ‘
Shades of Distrust _

This continued governmental distrust is dis-
tressing. The “colleges are full of Bolsheviks” atti-
tude of the Thirties apparently still has some cur-
rency in Washington. Then too, the ‘ineradicable
shadow of the late Senator McCarthy sometimes

falls across dealings of the gove1_'n'men_t with out-_=

spoken liberal institutions...

As soon; as NDEA was i.p'ass'ed, -Bryn Mawr,
Haverford, Princeton, and Swarthmore-took. a look .

at the affidavit clause and said, “No thank you.”
In subsequent months, Amherst; Antioch,‘Benning-

ton, Goucher, Grinnell, Reed, Sarah Lawrence, St._

Johns" of Baltimore, and Wilmington ‘joined the

rebels. The affair came ibackiinto‘ the~news, last "
summer when Senator John F. Kennedy introduced’

a bill proposing the repeal of the loyalty clause.

The Senate turned down the idea, 49-42.
“Several weeks ago, Harva'rd’s_President‘ Nathan

Pusey announced that his school was getting out,

now that it was obvious that the government had ,

not wisely reconsidered its restrictions. Yale and
Oberlin withdrew during the same week bringing

_ the total of protestors to sixteen.

Harvard’s Pusey called the provision “discrimi-
natory since it singles out the students alone in
our population — and, among students, the need-
iest — as subjects for special distrust.” He also
declared that the oath of allegiance itself made

the “disclaimer” affidavit superﬂuous. Yale’s Whit-
ney Griswold announced that that part of the act-

“represents an affront to freedom of belief and con-
science.” The loan fund, then, has become a hot
potato  college education, generally.
Lukewarm Disturbance ' I

But not really_very hot here. In this, the second
year of participation, 499 P/itt students are receiv-
ing aid in the amount of $242,000 from .NDEA.
When the requirements of the ‘loan were announced

last year, the University ﬁled ‘a letter of protest’

with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare. The administration hoped for the repeal of
the offensive clause.

Now, while the administration agrees with.

Pusey that the clause is ineffective and futile, be-
cause subversives would be only too happy to‘ sign

a ‘,‘disclaimer” atﬁdavit, it needs the money for its
students and so is staying in the program. 'It‘
appears to be a matter of letting thescholos that

are ﬁnancially secure ﬁght thebattle for us.
An undergrad‘ at Harvard and"Princeton could
always get aid'from the vast, private resources of
those schools. With a barely 'resp,ectab_le endow-
ment, Pitt could not get that $242,000 from other

-sources. However, /the wisdom of our philosophy

is still open to debate.
There was little opposition to the dual loyalty

_ clause on therpart of students here. Only one per-

son balked at the pledge, and fortunately, the
school, got funds for him elsewhere, presumably
at the same low interest, long repayment "rates

which the government provides. -The local head H
of the American Association of University Pro-',

fessors publicly protested the loyalty oath, too.

V This contro:versy~is‘unfortunate on‘ a variety of ‘
grounds. There is the matter of the suspicion with

which :the government still 5 views, the American

‘student and teacher, which,was mentioned earlier.‘

The NDEA loan fund was intended to aid the col-

_1eges,‘”but.it had to have objectionable strings at-'
tached to it which .do much to subvert its aid.

-Federal Aid Implications _
What is happening to the money which 16 out-

standing schools feel they cannot give to needy
students?- That money ‘might just as [well never

'have been appropriated. The net gain is nothing.

Then there is a larger devil looming over the
affair. Most educatorsagreel that Within the next
few years higher -education «will have to get more

= federal aid or go out'of -business in the face of"

the. ﬂood_.of new college students. But if the pres-
ent caper in the NDEA loan fund and sad experi-

ence of "the past are reliable indications of the V
A 'governm‘en_t’s-- intention to keep sticky ﬁngers on
‘the educational dollar, what responsible college.

oiﬁcialcould accept such aid?

_ The legislators would deny‘ interference "and
technically‘ they would be right. But it is not
overt interference that higher learning fears. It is
rather the subtle-distortions which selﬁsh, fearful
provisions in legislation can create that learnin
must uncompromisingly ﬁght. . -

To compromise the’ truth, even slightly, in order J

to gain money today cannot help butdhave serious
consequences in the future. Freed,omof‘any kind
does not usually, come to an abrupt end; it ﬁrst
slowly crumbles away underneath. How many
cracks can one see or hear in the foundations of
American academ_ic freedom? A - A

And as John Ciardi said recently, “Has any-
one had time to think of Mr. Khrushchev lately?”

Burford Supporters

Want Debbie’s Columns

Editor, the Pitt News:

Since we are devoted readers
of the Pitt News, we would like
to ask a favor of you. Please’ do
not take Ronald Burford’s advice
concerning the discontinuation
of Deborah Willson’s column. If
you do, then he’ll stop writing
his letters which we consider the
funniest part of the paper.

Columns Wanted Again,

But Different Reason

Editor, the Pitt News,

A few comments concerning
the criticism leveled by Mr.
Ronald Burford in two recent
issues of'the Pitt News at De-
borah Willson’s columns (or was

' it leveledat Deborah Willson?)

Criticism is a ﬁne art and has
an especial place in an institu-
tion— devoted

0 $151 an 1°.

. But

to the maintenance _

ening of intellectual capacities.
personal mockery, while
fun, does no discernible good
and has no recognizable place in
such an institution.

Whether or not a piece of ma-
terial is “funny” is largely a
matter of opinion, and I, as well
as many to whom I have spoken
do consider Miss Willson’s col-
umns “funny.” They are not
meant to be wildly comic or hil-
arious. They are meant to be——
and are-—-pleasant, relaxed, and
amusing. Besides having the
proverbial deeper meaning, they
are enjoyable.

There is loads of room on this
campus for student-written’ arti-
cles and stories, humorous or
other. Since Mr. Burford has
deigned to admit that he is cap-
able of writing better humorous
columns than Miss Willison with
his inkwell tied behind his back
(a wryly humorous bit, that) we
would all be more. than pleased.
to see an example of his work.

a. ‘ It as

dearth of humorous publication,
it is a shame for a young hum-
orist to dissipate his energies in
petty ,personal attacks upon
those who are trying. '

Gollation Given
To University S

Last week as a gesture of inter-
cultural cooperation, the govern-
ment of Yugoslavia presented a
collection of books on matters of
Yugoslav cultural interest to the
oﬂice of Cultural and Educational
Exchange. ‘ ‘

In addition to this gift, the Con-
vsul General in Pittsburgh donated
'§"kubera, a-pistol from the six-
teenth century; a doll in Croatian
costume; and a gusle, the national
musical instrument of Yugoslavia.

Dr. Shepherd L. Witman, di-
rector of the Office of Cultural
and Educational Exchange, an-
nounced that the books will be
presented to the university li-
brary and the artifacts to Mr.

‘Falenski High For Panthers With 16

94-49, Victory;

Tonight the Panthers meet their third Big Ten team
in'a row when they travel to Lafayette, Ind., to meet the

Boilermakers of Purdue.

You can’t win them all. Last Saturday night

Coach Bob

Timmons’ Panthers p\r’oved that old saying by going down
totheir first defeat of the season (which justhappened to

be the worst defeat in Panthei$

basketball history), 94-49, to one
of the best basketball teams in
the nation, Ohio State.

The Cats were completely out-
classed as All-American Jerry
Lucas and four other sharpshoot-
ers handled the Panthers as if they
were a high school team.

Favenski High

Timmons’ crew could not shoot,
rebound or even get a good shoot.
The only reason the score wasn’t
higher was because Ohio State
Coach Fred Taylor put his third
team in with seven minutes left
in the game.

About the only Panther who

. looked any good was Dick Fal-

enski, who scored..16 points to
lead the Panthers in that de-
partment.

Falcnski might have scored
more points and perhaps kept the
game a little closer, but for some
strange reason Timmons elected to
remove him from the game about
mid-way in the second half. He
never got back in.

Lucas Passes Off

Lucas was the high scorer for
the evening with 24 points. The
big 6-71/_: mphomore took only
one shot the whole game. That
was a hook shot from the corner
which he made. The other 22
points came on foul shots, tip—ins
and lay-ups.

It Lucas wanted to he could/

have scored 40 points but the
sophomore passed off time and
