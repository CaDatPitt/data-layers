Switch in Henry V Date

Reduced rate tickets for the British-made motion picture,
Henry V, now showing at the Art Cinema theater, will be avail-
able to Pitt students and faculty members for the showings

from March 24 to 28, including bne matinee Thursday after-‘

noon, March 27. '

Originally scheduled to receive the cut-rate pasteboards
for the week of March 17, Student congress sought the ad-

March 10

Pitt’s Red Cross drive for 1947
begins Monday, March 10 and
continues until Saturday, March
15. Although the students’ contri-

butions are set for Tuesday and
Wednesday only, the faculty and
administration drive will extend
through the entire week.

At the Student congress meet-
ing. Tuesday, March 4, Pat Wil-
liams and Ralph Wilde were ap-
pointed co-chairmen. Because the

.appointment of the chairmen is

so recent, they have not had time
to schedule a meeting, so no quota
is .set at present for either the
student body or the faculty and
administration.’

Contributions will be solicited

-in the classrooms by members of

the student liody. Since no pledg-
es are to be accepted from the
students, Miss Rush, dean of
women, advises that they be pre-
pared to give their contributions
on the selected days. In past
years, individual student contri-
butions have been set at the mini-
mum of $1, but nothing is settled
yet for this year’s minimum.

Pitt hopes not only to reach the
quota of last year but to pass it.
The ﬁgures for the 1946 campaign
are:

Players’ production of “Room
Service,” slated for Stephen Fos-
ter memorial March 20, 21, and 22.

Spurred to action by the pro-
tests of the members of Pitt Play-
ers, Congress requested that Wil-
liam Saalbach, assistant to the
dean of men, endeavor to have the
special showings of Henry V
changed in line with the congres-
sional policy that University spon-
sored activities be granted exclu-
sive dates on the school calendar.

Prices for the special showings
will be $2 and $1.50, instead of
$2.40 and $1.80 for the eyenings
and $1.50 and $1 instead of $1.80

Dean’s Policy Over-ridden

By Wyn Smith

. Now is the. time for all Pitt coeds to count their calories,
dye their hair and practice push-ups if they want to be pre-
pared for the “favorite brunette” contest. ‘ V

Pitt ’s participation in the competition was approved Tues-
day, March 4, by Student congress on the recommendation
of the Women’s Self Government Association Executive com-
mittee. Congress voted to " support the contest even though

it breaks with the traditional pol-9

icy of the‘ ofﬁce of the dean of
women toward any competition
of this type among‘ Pitt women.
Congress appointed Larry Buer-
winkel and Mary Jane Dunsmoor
as co-chairmen.

Nationally" sponsored by the
Paramount studios, producers of
Bob Hope’s new picture, “My
Favorite Brunette,” and locally

by radio station KDKA, the con- :1

test will include candidates chos-
en by the student body of each of
the five colleges in the Pittsburgh
area.

Karl Krug, Kaspar Monahan,
and Harold Cohen, theatre critics
from the Pittsburgh newspaper
staffs, are slated to select the fin-
al winner from the ﬁve contest-
ants. This coed will join the other
winners. chosen by each of 15
leading cities to represent them,
in a train trip to Hollywood as
guests of Bob Hope for several

A Pitt students have interests. That’ we know. But what are
they? . T
V As a publication, trying desperately to keep our ﬁngers
on the pulse of thestudent abodygiwe feel at this point that
we are a miserable failure . . . not that we couldn’t keep our
‘ﬁngers on the studentliipulse but that either they haven’t got

one,‘-‘. or they are keeping it hidden under a bafrel (spelled
with one ‘‘I’’). . “ A ' ‘

T T We are on the verge of suggesting that the University close
tsgdoors and carry, on classes by correspondence. Would this

be too drastic a measure? Well, let’s see what has happened
fthisgyear to prove that our suggestion would be unjustiﬁed.

T Early in the football season, Student congress revived
the cheering block. A committee worked strenuously to orga-
nize it,» but after a series of ups and downs, brought on by
both“ the students and faculty, it ﬁnally fell. through. From the
student body came no comment when it was planned. From
the student body came no comment when it failed.

News reporter viewed the show and wrote his opinions on it.
The Cap and Crown cast, en masse, descended upon the News

 show.

Independents Don’t Care

Murmurings drifted into our oﬁice about unrest among
certain independent students on campus who felt they were
‘left out of things and didn’t have adequate ‘enough’ say in
the’go'verning of the. student body. The -outcome from the News’
standpoint: one article on the History of Independent students
at "Pitt; ‘one letter to the editor (solicited by writer of above
mentioned history); one editorial calling for ,organization_ of
an independent party. No comment from ‘the students. C i

The condition of University track house was brought to

A couple of years ago we had?""a freshman
named Joe Pitt. He came from a good family
and lived in a beautiful 42-story apartment
house. His family made lots of money in the
steel business. Joe was a pretty fair tiddly-
winks player and came to our school mainly
because our favorite pastime was playing tid-
dly-winks. We had a lot of good tddly-winks
players on campus, but Joe could beat any of
them most of the time.

Of course Joe didn’t play clean tiddly-
winks, but that didn’t seem to bother him too
much until he found that none of the other
fellows wanted to play tiddly-winks with him
because he cheated. ’

Joe had bought himself a beautiful tiddly-
win.ks board, one of the ﬁnest on the campus,
but because he couldn’t seem to arrange any
tiddly-winks contests "with the boys he was
having trouble meeting the payments on his
board, which was very, very expensive. 4

Now the most respected fraternity on our
campus was composed of ten‘ members and
was called the Big Ten. The BT‘s‘played a
rather unorthodox game of pure tiddly—winks
according to their own set of rules. And they
were pretty snobbish and didn’t like playing

tiddly-winks with outsiders.

Tidpdly-Winks Was His Game

They were darn good students, too, es--
pecially ‘Percival Chicago. Percy was really
a bookworm who didn’t care mu.ch for tiddly-
Winks. (He wasn’t a very good tiddly-winks
player anyway.)

But, since a love of tiddly-winks was a pre-
requisite for membership in the BT, Percy
felt obliged to resign.‘ His ‘(departure brought
consternation to the BT house. It meant the
BT’s had to pledge a new man or play tiddly-
winks with some -of the‘ GDI’s_ on campus.

‘T ere were.a7few country cousins of the
BT’s in school who were BT legacies and who
wanted very much to join the frat,“ but ‘the
BT’s overlooked them and smiled with favor‘

on Joe Pitt. because he was more acceptable

socially and because/they knew he had a big
expensive ‘tiddly-winks board on which they
wanted very much to play tiddly-winks.
So a few days after Percy resignedvas a BT,
the remaining‘members’sent O. S. U. Colum-
bus (Known as Buckeye on the campus) out
to start rushing Joe. Buck brought Joe over to
the frat house, a nice—,.big, warm, comfortable

_ house,-and told him the brothers were consid-

ering pledging him. V

 . Till The B.T.’s, P.G.’s, -and G.D.I.’s

Joe played a few games of tiddly-winks
with the boys and, since heplayed by a differ-
ent set of rules, Joe had little troublein beat-
ing all thebrothers. Then Buckeye gave Joe
a copy of the BT tiddly-winks rules and in-
vited him to return the next afternoon ‘to
play a few games ‘according to the new rules.

Joe studied the rules until well; past mid-,
night, for he wanted very much to move into
the nice, big», warm, comfortable BT house and e
eventually to become_ a BT himself.

- The next day, when Joe went back to the
BT house, all the brothers defeatedhim at
tiddly-winks. But Joe didn’t‘ care, for before
he left, he had a BT pledgepin. _

At the end of that semester, Joe moved in-
to the room vacated by ‘Percy’ Chicago, but he
thought the arrangement a little unusual. He‘
was actually apledge, butihe wasn’t allowed

“ 7z..4e.-no.) ,4... 

Milligan stew. .

« My mother -made -meivfwear» them-it’s1  out!!!

   

to wear his pledge pin outside the house. He D 

was supposed to tell all the GDI’s and the
other frat men that he was merely a house-
man at the BT house. ' -
Joe was quite confused, but the thought that
shortly he would be initiated into the Big
Ten was uppermost in his mind. He hadn’t won
a‘ game of tiddly-winks from any of the ac-
tives since he moved into the house. Occasion- ~
ally he’d beat some of the GDI’s down at the
campus beer parlor, but he just couldn’t top
any actives. Joe spent most of his afternoons

at the local beer parlor drinking whisky and
TEA, a specialty from the Chicago Bars. His

big brother, Buck Columbus, suggested that,

this diet was affecting his tiddly-winks, game
and suggested that Joe change his diet to
include Weskey and Fesler-—water.

 . Met, Bet, and Set Him

.A few weeks on thisnew diet and Joe didn ’t
recognize himself.’ His general appearance im-
proved. His spirit improved. (His spirits im-
proved.) AND, more important, his tiddly-
winks improved. He came close to beating sev-
eral of the actives. He particularly threatened
his big brother, Buck Columbus, and would
have beaten him if the game had ended a lit-
tle sooner. Buck, the house champ, became
frightened and bought up all the Weskeyiand ,
Fesler water on campus.

And still Joe was'a pledge. The actives ,

kept postponing his initiation.

T Now next to the BT house was the PC
house——the Paciﬁc Coasters. And between the
two houses was a ‘beautiful rose bush. ~ The
roses from -this bush iweré‘-very valuable, es- A
peciallywhen placed in bowls with brass bands.
So the BT’s and the PC’s made an agreement
that the best tiddly-winks player from each
house would have the privilege of taking these
rose bowls down to Pasadena drive to sell them
to the townfolks who,.prized them. very much.
The two houses then split the proﬁts from the
sales of the bowls.

. . . Out of The Race
Well last Week things came to a head, when
Joe demandedto know when he would be ini-
tiated as a full brother. The BT’s decided that
they were quite ‘happy with the proﬁts from
their rose bowls being split nine ways, and

could not see why they should initiate and

split them ten ways. .

Joe even changed his diet toinclude some

But. Joe doesn’t know which way to turn.
He still wants to become a BT more than
anything else in the world- Hestill has pay- T
ments coming due on his big beautiful tiddly. r
winks board- He’s not too successful at the
BT variety of tiddly-winks, but nevertheless
he thinks it’s a great game.

Frankly, we’re worried about Joe. He walks
around the campus between classesxin a. daze.
He ’s. really a forlorn person. The ‘GDI’s won’t '
speak to him-because he’s practically a frat-
man, The other frat-men won’t talk to him
because he’s. supposed to be a_ BT. But the
BT’s won’t accept him- as a brother; There’s

not much we can do, except sit around and

see ‘what, happens.
Poor Joe!

says, “My main reason for run-
ning for Men’s Councilis so stu-
dents can have a better voice in
school activities and have activi-
ties run the way they want them.
At present it appears as if the
school is placing activities before

‘the students instead of the stu-

dents suggesting their ideas to the

' school.”

“KDKA  Contest.

(Continued from Page 1)

In Miss Helen Poole Rush’s
opinion, Pitt women would be
judged cheaply, “in terms of their
measurements.”

‘A majority of committee mem-
bers, nevertheless, were convinc-
ed that such a contest would
stimulate the slumbering stu-dent
body. They stressed the‘fa-ct that
this contest was not a “beauty
contest” primarily, but that the
coed would be chosen for her per-
sonality, general intelligence, and
looks combined.

Another point in favor of the .

contest, they claimed, was that
Pitt’s absence from such a com-
‘petition might aggravate an al-
ready bitter, though sometimes
unfounded, attitude among the
student body over the University
control of student affairs.

Korean Interpreter .
Says Pitt ‘Very Nice ’

   

A 26-year-old Korean school teacher, Han Op Kim, has ‘ ‘

enrolled at Pitt to further his education under the ﬁnancial.
auspices of William K. Block,

co-publisher of the Pittsburgh

Post—Gazette and the Toledo Blade.

Although he just arrived _in Pittsburgh Sunday morning,
Mr. Kim registered and attended his ﬁrst class, Physical Edu-'
cation at Trees Gym on Wednesday aftern6on.' ‘

When he was assigned as inter-
preter for Mr. Block in the 52nd
Military Government headquar-
ters, at Kwangwon-Do, Mr. Kim
could/not know that some day
this American would provide his
transportation to the United States,
his living expenses, and his tui-
tion at Pitt.

The American publisher is spon-
soring the education of Mr. Kim
because he believes strongly “that
the future of Korea depends upon
the improvement of education of
.the young Koreans who will
eventually take over the govern-
ment of their own country.”

Mr. Kim plans to major in edu-
cation and sociology, so that he
may contribute to the advance-
ment of culture and civilization in
Korea.

He was born in the Russian-
occupied zone-_-north of the 38th
parallel’-—where his parents, two
brothers and a .sister now live.
After graduation from’ the Pyong

An Normal school in 1940, he-

taught in primary schools until he
was employed by the Military
Government in 1945.

Mr. Kim marvels. at the wealth
and beauty of the United States
which he saw while traveling
from San Francisco to Pittsburgh.
He observes that Korean enter-
taimnent can not begin to com-
pare with " the many - kinds ’ of
amusement here; the theater pro-
grams, sports events, and dances.

He has been impressed by Am-

a

erican women. He is amazed at

-

the social position they enjoy, a_ , it

status in direct contrast to that
Korean women whose place is
strictly in the home.

met in his ﬁrst few days at school,
Mr. Kim proves his happiness with
the sparkle in his eyes.

of this practice for which the stu-

Mr. Biddle states that although
he cannot prevent this "situation

lice can, and often do tow illegal-

cated the licensing of psycholo-

currence of human action. He said
his own ﬁeld of experimental ‘psy-
chology was in chaos because it
dealt with aspects. not processes
of behavior.
human behavior is always under
human control, he regretted the

reluctance of psychologists to as-

sume that control. Dr. Skinner

Up or ]Down--
But Not Both

Here’s what happened when
three students tried to exercise
what newspaper, reporters are
fond of calling, “good old Yan-
kee ingenuity.”

Three students waited im-
patiently on the eighth ﬂoor for
a down elevator. .Three red
lights were snuffed out in or-
der. Then came the inspiration.
They took the next elevator
and rode to the eighteenth ﬂoor.

Elevator op: “Eighteen.”

Trio: “Ah . . we’re going
down.”

Elevator op: (in an emphatic
tone)—“No round trips on this
car. Get out.” .

Trio: “But, we . . .I h.”

Elevator op: “C’mon, get out,

I won’t have any round trips on
this car.”

The trio slowly, and in a daz-
ed sort of way, left the car. One
of the three who evidently is
not “completely oriented to the
institutional arrogance of the
University elevator operators
muttered:

“What is this, dictatorship?”

You can’t beat the rap men!

Round-Up  

Baseball

After a week’s delay because of
a broken water main that ﬂooded
the indoor ﬁeld, the pitcher and
catcher aspirants to the Pitt base-
ball team began belated workouts

V Monday at the Stadium.

Even though they didn’t have
to wade through water, the
Panther baseballers were ham-
pered somewhat by the chilly
atmosphere of the supposed “in-
door” ﬁeld. In reality, the Pitt
practice diamond gets very lit-
tle beneﬁt of any ’ heat gener-
ated by the stadium’s heating
‘system.

2 . Baseball coach Ralph Mitterling

reports that he got a ﬁne response
to his call for pitcher and catcher
candidates. More than forty hope-
fuls are battling it out for berths
in these two positions.

Although he hasn’t much time
to look them over closely yet,
Coach Mitterling recognizes many
faces in the group as members of
former Pitt nines. In the hurling
department, two tossers from last

year’s nine Casey and Calder, are '

back for another season of base-
ball.

Lucchino is another “veteran
diamondman, having hurled for
the Jungle Cats in ’45. George
Goldberg, a standout on the ’44

A A ball team, is still another candi-

date.

Mitterling reports that he even
has a moundsman from 1941,
Howard Scott, working out with -

’ the squad. Scott entered the
service after the ’41 season and

"did plenty of throwing over-

seas.

Coach Mitterling expects his star
hurler of last year, Sammy David,
to report for practice soon, now
that the basketball team has closed
its season.

Of the catching prospects, Gene
Yanchus and Sweinbreten, of last
year’s squad, have returned. Fas-

I sio, who was a receiver for the

Sweaters

'1‘-he sw‘eater award situation
which has caused much grumbl-
ing since 1943, will be cleared up
in the near future. University or-
ders whi-ch have been on ﬁle with
Shea Sporting Goods company
may be ﬁlled in six weeks.

Representatives from Shea’s re-
ceived sample shipments Feb. 27.

Lettermen now in school will
have ﬁrst call on the incoming
sweaters. Then as the backlog of
orders are ﬁlled, all letter win-

ners will receive the blue coat-,

award—type garment. _

Further clariﬁcation was offered
by Jamesvl-Iagan, director of ath-
letics, when he said: ,

“We approved the sample
shipment which Shea’s re-
ceived Feb. 2'7 and hope to
have delivery within six weeks.
I realize the boys have been
waiting a long time and I cer-
tainly hope we can clear up
this situation quickly.

“We hesitated to accept
sweaters until we were certain
of getting the best garment
available.”

Confusion concerning the sweat-
er award delay was heightened
recently when downtown store
windows displayed sweaters sim-
ilar to the type previously issued
by Pitt. ,

However, representatives at
Shea’s pointed out that these
sweaters were made of repro-
cessed wool. They do not have
the wearing quality of the’ 100
per cent wool. sweater.

1945 edition of the Jungle Cats,
is another applicant for the cur-
rent nine.

Coach Mitterling feels certain
that he has plenty of good mater-
ial among the newcomers. From
the new men and the returnees
he intends to mould a winning
combination.

Last Tuesdays interfraternity
struggles saw the ﬁrst division
teams pitted against each other,
with the favorites living up to ex-
pectations to stay in the thick of
the title race. - _

Dick Seewald’s 14 points
-pulled the league-leading ,Phi
Ephs out of the ﬁre to gain a
39-34 victory over the Alpha
Phi Delta. Meanwhile, PiKA,
hot on the heels of the Phi
Eps, dumped the Phi Kaps, 29-
18.

Delta Tau Delta strengthened
its hold on third place by beating
it closest competitor, Phi Gam,
20-15. Webber led the way with
eight points. The Pi Lams con-
tinued to ride their hard luck
streak by losing to the Phi Delts,
31-29.

It was their second successive
two point loss.

Whileuthe fraternity teams were
battling away, the future dentists
were occupied in pulling each
other’s basketball teeth. The den-
tal Seniors maintained the re-
spect of the Sophomores by giving
the Sophs a 54-17 spanking.
Meanwhile, the Freshmen turned
back the Juniors, 28-17. ‘

With the fraternity teams going
into their ﬁnal week of competi-
tion, hotly contested games are
anticipated. The players are go-
ing all out to win. '

On Tuesday the Phi Eps
should have light sailing when
they go up against the Pi Lams.
The luckless Lams have spent
the better part of the season
down in the league cellar. The
Phi Eps, on the other hand, have
been branded bad medicine to
one and all.

If the script is followed, Delta
Tau Delta will make’ quick work
of the Sae, and Sigma Chi will
defeat the Alpha Phi Alpha. In

closer, Theta Chi is favored over
the Phi Delts. The Alpha Phi Del-
ta gets the nod'over the Phi Kaps.

For Lack Of Direction

Urges Officials To Establish Set Policy
Calls For Conference of Coaches—Oﬁicials
By John Golightly

When does a referee cease being a referee and become
a mere whistle tooter? No one knows exactly when this hap-
pens but it is now the usual thing in the Pittsburgh district.

Spectators at Pitt’s home

tilts, became more aggrevated

as the season progressed. All of which poses this ques-

tion :

Blames Leadership

Panther_ mentor Dr. Harold C.
Carlson has had ’more than his
share of arguments with the men
in striped shirts. He places the
blame directly upon the leader-
ship of the basketball ofﬁcials and
claims theyihave failed to give
direction to the harassed referees
and umpires.

“The referees and umpires
are honest and energetic,”
he explained, “but that does-
not make up for their mistakes-.
We estimate the oﬁicials are
entitled to 20 mistakes a game
but in our games they aver-
age close to 40 and 50 errors.”
Dr. Carlson was quick to point

out that, “In the West they throw
away the rule book. bdoubt if
half the officials know the rules,”

Ex-Carlsonites

Jack Boose, who left the squad
at mid-term’, is playing with, the
Leslie club in the County league.
Although playing regularly, Jack
has been disappointing. Also on
the Leslie roster is Eddie Strall.
When at Pitt in ’41 Strall was
known as Stralski.

Hank Zeller, last year’s ace cen-

.ter, spent this season with the

Ironmen. While seldom piling up
many points, Hank has been a
great aid to the Paul Birch-coach-
ed pros, He is a ﬁne team player.

Hank usually travels by plane
to away games. He is ﬁnishing

~ Med school.

Long Roger Jorgenson has been
carried on the Ironmen roster
most of the season. He left Carl-
son’s ice cream eaters prior to the
opening game. R-og has displayed
little of the form which won him
rave notices at Ohio State prior
to the war.

Why are the district officials always in hot water?

he continued.

He contrasted this to the East
where they tend to favor the de-
fense. Then, he explained how,
“In our district everything is in
an uproar. It changes from game
to game.” ’

Dislikes Arguing

Dr.» Carlson disposed of a popu-
lar notion that he enjoys battling
with the arbiters when he said:

“I don’t like to be out there
complaining every game, but
what can I do? I criticize my
own players just as much
when they commit errors..For
one thing they call entirely too
many fouls.

“This antagonizes the players,
angers the coaches, and turns a
good ball game into a farce. It’s
merely another examination of
their lack of direction or guid-
ance.”

Although Dr. Carlson was free
with his criticism, he was just as
ready with suggestions for im-
provement. His proposal was that
the basketball officials’ executive
committee get together and as-
sume the responsibility of provid-
ing guidance for the harassed oﬁ‘i-
cials. ,

“Maybe a’ session between
the oﬁicials and coaches in"
..the district would create bet-

’ ter understanding” he suggest-
ed. «

Next move is up to the officials.

Mr. George Weekes, di-
rector of intramural athletics,
plans to include badminton in
his extensive spring sports
program. A meeting will be
held on Tuesday, March 11,
at 12:30 p.m. in the Cathedral
gym. Anyone interested in
badminton should attend.

Comes To Pitt In 1940

Colorado college lured him into
its Phys Ed department from 1930
to 1935 as an athletic trainer. His
next stop was the University of
Colorado, where as swimming
coach he tucked a three-year di-
vision championship and a run-

gner-up slot in the Rocky Moun-

tain conference meets under his
belt.

Howard came to Pittsburgh in
1940 and spent two years as head
athletic trainer here before enter-
ing the Navy in August, 1942. A
Lieutenant in the Naval Aviation
Training program, he says he “did
a little of everything while in
service.” “Everything” explained
means he was connected with op-
erations and communications, was
a head squadron leader, and an
athletic trainer for a ﬂeet air

November of 1945 brought
him back to the Panther ath-

one year later, December 1946,
he was appointed swimming
coach for the ’46-’47 season.

Enter Six Event

Since Howard and his boys got
under way late this season, they
were hampered in making up a
schedule. The record books show
four wins and two losses out of
six meets. The squad entrains to
Rutgers university for the East-
ern Intercolegiate meets on March
1-5. ~
For this last event the Blue and
Gold will have entries in to 50

In Scoring Race

Sam David, Dodo Canterna,

prised Pitt’s Big Four in the scor-
ing column, as the Panthers com-
pleted the season with eight wins
and ten losses.

David tallied 177 points to ‘bop
the scorers. Canterna followed
with 151, Apple notched 136, and
Cieply squ-eezed in with an even
100. Canterna, who was sidelined
for ﬁve games following a shoul-
der injury, was tops in game av-
erage with 11.6 per contest.

Dodo captured further honors
when he bucketed 27 points in the
season's ﬁnale against West Vir-
ginia. This success made the stal-
wart Panther guard the high scor-
er for a single game.

During four years of varsity
competition, Nate Apple, Jungle
Cat captain, piled up 472 mark-
ers, His smooth passing and ac-
curate shooting was one of the
highlights of the season.

Pitt’s scoring and that of its
opponents practically balanced.
Over the long haul, the Panthers
registered 835 points, an average
of 46.4 per game. Pitt’s opponents
chalked up 829 tallies, an aver-
age of 46 points per tilt.

Rushing is the theme of frater-
nity activity right now, with the
fraternities hitting the climax
and the sororities providing ac-
tion. ~

The SAE’s hit top billing among
the men this week with the boast
of a semi—forma1 dance this Sat-
urday night. By the way, the
SAE spotlight now shines on Bob
Amalong, newly elected president.

One way to get around and
avoid expenses is to let the men
invite you. So say the TPA’s,
mentioning in the same breath
that it was the Theta Chi’s and
SAE’s the last time.

Tonight the Fiji alumni plus
the activities (two tables on the
roof, please) hold their annual
Pig Dinner.——Wow, wha’ an op-
portunity, but Abby won’t let me!
Saturday evening they clear away
the leventy-seven hundred tables
for a house dance a la rushee.

Now that the war is over, the
Zetas are eating again at their
traditional Monday'evening din-
ners, but as soon as rushing is
over, it’s rumored that their at-
tention will turn from rushing
and dinners to PiKA’s‘.

Tonight many Delts afford past
president Jim Johns a last chance
at pre-marital freedom as they
hold a stag for him at Willig’s -

on Willig. Tomorrow night it’s
the Iris Ball at the Shelter.

Any one with a snow suit and
sled better look up '.he Delta Zetas
this Saturday night. Seems said
sorority is having a toboggan
party—that is, if the weather de-
cides to be unusual and keep on
snowing.

Rushing dances are the style
this Saturday night for the boys
of PiKA, Pi Lambda Phi, and
Sigma Chi. The PiKA’s "ake over
the Dormont Century Club and
feature intermissions of hypno-
tism (have to get pledges some
way), the Pi Lams stay at home
this week to honor their rushees
and their new president, Herb
Franklin, and the Sigma Chi’s
polish up their Southern accents
for their dance at one of the coun-
ty parks. (South, that is.)

Ginnie Reynolds, Janet Nees-
ham, and Lynn Gollada, all Chi
0’s now, were initiated last week.
Lucky gals! They’re allowed to sit
on furniture now instead of the
ﬂoor. P. S.—In case you’re in-
quisitive——the new furniture just
arrived.

Found near the boiler room,
Shadyside: scraps of paper with
the following notes.

Very little talk of the Tuck
Shop gossipers at Shadyside is
centered around the coming men’s
elections. It isn’t lack of interest

~ but the fact that in order to "vote

the men have to walk a long nine
blocks to Soldiers and Sailors Me-
morial hall. Considering their
numbers, the 70-0 Shadyside men
wish that provision had been
made to facilitate their voting.

After reading of the promises
made by politicos last week, the
academy boys offer a provision
that might be included in the pro-
gram of some platform philosoph-
er. The cost of a pencil sharpener
is small compared to the great
need for them. Why not start a
campaign to have the school pro-
vide a few sharpeners?

Two phone booths are now be-
ing installed at Shadysi-de. This
should relieve the load on the
“free” phone in the basement.
