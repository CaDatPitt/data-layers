Interim CGS dean named; Public
Safety director search continues

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

The search to fill one major
administrative position at Pitt has
ended, at least for the time
being, but a search committee’s
efforts to fill another hotly—dis-
cussed position have been left
out in the cold.

Former College of General
Studies Associate Dean Robert
W. Comfort was named interim
dean of CGS by Pitt interim

Provost Mark A. Nordenberg last

week.

Comfort, who had served as
associate dean of CGS since
1973, is ﬁlling the position left

vacant by John Bolvin.
According to the I/7/ll'£‘£’7'S1'l_)’
Times, Bolvin announced his
retirement in September 1992
and was slated. to leave the posi-
tion by last July, but he decided
to keep his position until a
replacement was found.

In a Jan. 21 memo sent to the
CGS community, Nordenberg
said Comfort has the credentials
necessary to take on his new
position.

“He is well known on this
campus for both his administra-
tive ability and for his commit-
ment to teaching,” Nordenberg
said in the memo. “I have com-
plete confidence in the ability of

Dr. Comfort to lead ICGS
However, desj>ite Comfort”s
20 years of exper‘ience as CGS's
associate dean. his lack of acad-
emic tenure may currently serve
as a disadvantage.
Nordenberg, who was
unavailable for comment
Tuesday afternoon, told the
/niL'ersil_)r Times that he decided
not to name a permanent CGS
dean yet because prerequisites
for the position, as set down by
former Pitt Provost Donald
Henderson, called for someone
entitled to tenure in his or her
academic department.

University Democrats
endorse Volpe for Gov.

Byjohn B. Moore
Stajf Writer

Following a spirited debate last
night, the University Democrats
voted to endorse Chuck Volpe for
the Democratic nomination for
governor of Pennsylvania.

After 20 minutes of hearing rea-
sons for and against supporting
Volpe, the votes were taken and a
7-4 decision for the endorsement
resulted.

Voicing his support for endors-

ing Volpe, UD Secretary Eric
Schultz said, “Quite personally, I
think he is the best for the job.
He’s genuine, he’s real, he’s not a
politician — he’s a real person 
he comes across as someone we
can trust.”
, Schultz said he thought it was in
the group’s interest to be associat-
ed with Volpe’s name. “\Y/hether
he wins or not, or puts up a strong
fight or comes in last, he repre-
sents a lot of what this club is
about.”

In opposition of the endorse-
ment was UD Vice President Greg
Marshan.

Marshan said because he was
unsure of Volpe’s policies, and that
the timing might be a little early to
announce an endorsement. He
said that the club should wait and

see if other candidates would talk
to the group.

“I think that before we can
endorse somebody we have to
know who we’re endorsing and
who we’re endorsing them over,”
said Marshan.

“I think we need to wait until
close to the end of the semester
until we’ve had a chance to either
meet other candidates, or get infor-
mation on other candidates,” he
said.

Marshan also stressed that
he had nothing against Volpe,
he just wanted to hold off on
the endorsement until the club
knew more about all of those run-
ning for the Democratic nomina-
tion. V

In another election held at last
night’s meeting, Dan Corle was
voted to be the UDS director of
public relations.

Also brought up at the meet-
ing was the appointment of
Stephanie Sudzina to represent
the club at Campus \X/omen’s
Organization meetings, as
well as meetings held by
the Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance. Sudzina would be
responsible for reporting back
to the UDs on on any relevant
issues mentioned at these meet-
ings.

Students create majors tbrougb Iuterdisczﬂinary Studies

Byjennjfer Sikora
Staff Writer

(Editors Note: This is tbe first
part of a two—part series on the
Liberal Studies Option.)

Students in the College of Arts
and Sciences who are undecided
about a major are expected to

gcsolve their uncertainties by the
end of their junior year.

The Liberal Studies Option,
now titled Interdisciplinary

Studies, is one program available
for students frustrated by existing
CAS majors. Under the consulta-
tion of a CAS advisor,
Liberal/Interdisciplinary Studies
candidates design an academic
program tailored to their career
goals.

“Why follow somebody else’s
prescription if it doesn’t suit your
needs?  This gives you a much
better chance to define what you
need to learn for your major,”

said Fred Koloc, CAS Advising
Director. “The Liberal Studies
degree was set up to allow stu-
dents to be more creative.”

“I couldn’t really find a major
for me,” said junior Elizabeth
Mania, who typed her proposal
Monday. Mania said she wanted
a degree involving international
studies. Her proposal includes
courses in French and German
writing and conversation, history
and political science.

Interdisciplinary Studies pro-
grams can involve one to three
thematic concentrations or “clus-
ters,” each including courses
from a single department or relat-
ed courses from several depart-
ments. A minimum of 42 credits
are necessary for a degree in
Interdisciplinary Studies. half of
those in upper—level courses.

Students combining Interdis-
ciplinary Studies with another
CAS departmental major or busi-

ness degree need at least 30
credits in their program.
However, there is more to
Interdisciplinary Studies than just
picking and choosing related
courses out of the Course
Description Guide, warns Koloc.
When students design the list
of courses they plan to take,
problems arise when courses are
offered infrequently — or never
again. “Of all the problems we’ve

2 A - A THE Prrr NEWS, Wednesday, Feb:-_uﬂ 9, 1994
Dr. Bob advises bow to become oz good student

Last year I wrote a column on
becoming a better student and
suggested that if you want to be
a good student, imitate one.
This remains the best advice I
can give on the subject, but if
you are reluctant to sitldown

' with a high-achieving friend

and make his or her strategies
your own, there are some other
things you can do.

One of the most common
errors students make is not hav-
ing a study plan. Most students
who are having trouble acade-
mically tend to fall behind early
in the term and then study on
demand as each upcoming
exam puts pressure on them.

What is needed is an attitude
change. It does little good to say
“I want to do better,” or “I’m
going to try harder." To be suc-
cessful, you need to commit
yourself to the work and, as
Ross Perot says, “Just do it.”

Two fairly simple habit

changes could also make a big
difference. The first is to make a
weekly study plan. It sounds
simple and it is, but most stu-
dents don’t take the time to do
it. The second step, which is
related and just as ~ - : '
simple, is to get in
the habit of keep-
ing a daily “to do”
list. You draw
items from your
weekly schedule
list, but modify it
to adjust for new
activities or even
your own chang-
ing moods. Put down all the sig-
nificant and insignificant things
you’cl like to do for the next
day. -
People who study the art of
list-making say that on most
lists, 80 percent of the value
comes from 20 percent of the
items on the list. So if you have
a list of 10 things to do, you

 

  

might want to asterisk-the two
or three things that are critical.
Try to get through all of your
list, but be determined to at
least accomplish the critical

items. At night, review your

accomplish-
ments (acade-
mic and
social) and
move unac-
complished
items to the
next day’s list.
Also, remem-
ber that some
« things you just
need to get done — you don’t
need to do them perfectly.
Carpenters who build rough
frames for buildings have a say-
ing they use when they hack a
chunk out of a two-by-four,
“Well, this ain’t no piano.” It
means perfection isn’t neces-

sary. Getting the job done is

HCCCSSZIFY.

The most important strategy
in all of this is to “have a strate-
gy.” In other columns, I have
said that in order to enhance
your chances for success at any-
thing you need to “begin with
the end in mind.” That is, you
need to think about where you
want to go or what you want to
achieve before you begin your
journey. If you do this, you’ll be
a more successful student and
develop an important habit that
will pay off for the remainder of
your life.

Those of you who want more
assistance with becoming a bet-
ter student should know that
the Learning Skills Center and
Counseling Center regularly
offer programs in study skills,
test anxiety, overcoming pro-
crastination and time manage-
ment. Stop by the third ﬂoor of
the William Pitt Union to get
more information on these pro-
grams.

Winter
weather
hits the
‘Burgh
again

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Students will have to
battle freezing rain and
slick sidewalks on the
way to class again today
because icy weather will
continue through this
afternoon, according to
the National Weather
Service forecast office in
Pittsburgh.

The NWS issued a win-
ter storm warning from
last night into the morn-
ing hours due to “danger-
ous ice accumulation” on
western Pennsylvania
roads from the freezing
rain. The freezing rain
and sleet which covered
Pitt with a sheet of ice
yesterday will continue
today, making travel dan-
gerous throughout the
city.

During a semester
which has seen three
snowstorms in its first five
weeks, most of the snow
around campus had dis-
appeared before
Tuesday’s two—inch accu-
mulation which forced
snowplows back onto the
streets. Traveling condi-
tions forced the cancella-
tion or postponements of
at least three student
group meetings at Pitt last
night. ’

Conditions will not
improve much today,
especially for commuters.
The NWS expects the
freezing rain and sleet to
change to snow around
noon. Snow accumula-
tion should be less than
an inch this afternoon,
with an 80 percent
chance of further precipi-
tation tonight, according
to the NWS.

The NWS said the pre-
cipitation will stop by
Thursday, but daytime
temperatures will be dip-
ping below’ 20 degrees
Fahrenheit by the end of
the week.

Students can send valentines romantic chords

Byjennifer Sikora
Staff Writer

The members of the Heinz
Chapel Choir will become
Singing Valentines again this
year, delivering messages of
romance to residences, offices,
restaurants and classrooms.

“We always get absolutely
glowing calls back,” said Choir
Director John Goldsmith. “Every
year I get calls from people who
heard the choir deliver [the song]
and ask if it’s too late to order.”

Goldsmith said he always tries
to squeeze in as many last-
minute calls as possible.

Singer Dan Dolan, a senior,
said choir members “target” and
enjoy entering a classroom to
deliver the “Please Be My_
Valentine” song.

“llnstructorsl just all of a sud-
den stop class to listen,” Dolan
said. “We’ve had 100 percent
good responses  other people
in the class usually clap and

laugh at the end."

The four—minute song is per-
formed a cappella and is
Goldsmith’s lyrical variation of
Dan Fogelbergs “Longer.”

“Sometimes it’s fun to just see
it embarrass the heck out of a
person, to see them turn totally
red,” said member Jon Abucejo,
a senior.

Reactions vary, said Dolan, but
“the girls usually weep, the guys
— sometimes.”

The 52-rnember choir breaks
into groups of eight to 12 singers,
according to Rae Thomas, stu-
dent organizer for the Singing
Valentines. Thomas said after the
song is finished, the recipient
receives a carnation and a kiss
on the cheek from a choir mem-
ber.

Christine Zarnich, a music
department administrator, said
she was in another faculty mem-
ber’s office when the singing
valentine was delivered to them
last year.

“They just knocked on the
door and came  Zarnich said.
"It was very nice. quite lovely 
It just gave me chills!“

Thomas said orders can be
delivered anywhere on campus
and to nearby off-campus areas,
including Oakland, Squirrel Hill,
Bloomfield and Shadyside.

However, Thomas said special
requests have been accommo-
dated in the past.

Last year a man paid the choir
$500 to deliver the Singing
Valentine message to his wife at
the RIDC building by the airport,
according to Goldsmith. For this
occasion, Goldmith said 25 choir
members donned tuxedos and
red gowns and brought red roses
instead of Carnations.

He also said one delivery last
year to a downtown restaurant
caught the chefs attention. The
chef later invited the choir to sing
for his parents’ 50th wedding
anniversary.

Dolan was the choir member

who introduced the idea of
Singing Valentines to Goldsmith
three years ago. Dolan said the
Singing Valentines were very
popular at his former college,
The George Washington
University.

The Singing Valentine orders
help the Heinz Chapel Choir
raise money for their concert
tour, music and advertising.
Orders are being taken this weelg
in the William Pitt Union and
Towers Lobby. Delivery dates
are Feb. 12, 15 and 14. The cost
for students sending messages
on-campus is $10; off-campus in
the vicinity of Oakland is S15.
Valentines can also be sung over
the telephone -— in-state calls
cost 87 while out-of—state calls
cost $9. Prices for adults and fac-
ulty vary, but they are more than
student rates. in addition to their
Singing Valentines, the choir will
perform "music for incurable
romantics" in the Williaiu Pitt
Union Friday at 9 p.m.

said Koloc.

Listing several alternative
courses is recommended, and
if those are never offered,
substitutions can be made at
Koloc’s approval.

But even before the student
can declare his or her major
as Interdisciplinary Studies, an

~u advisory committee of 11 fac-

ulty members must review
and approve each program
submitted.

Liberal Studies student Mark
Czap, a senior who designed
a pre-elementary education
degree, said he was asked by
the advisory committee to
revise his first proposal.

“[The committee] made sug-
gestions for courses they
thought would be more rele-
vant,” said Czap.

Koloc said the faculty com-
mittee rejects programs that
are too broad based or con-
tain unrelated courses and
clusters titled with the name
of a major.

“We view this as a student
wﬁo is literally creating a
major for themselves and
should be able to articulate
why they’re doing it and
where it is going to be a bene-
fit for them,” said Koloc.

He said proposals demon-

Additionally, Nordenberg said
in his memo that Pitt’s new

the university's senior adminis-

declined the university’s offer

currently works made him a bet-

Walter Waters, who has served
as interim director of public safe-
ty since William Brennan
resigned the position last March,
said the outlook for finding
Brennan"s full-time replacement
is still unclear.

“Everything is still up in the
air,” Waters said. “I don’t know if
[the search committee] is going
to pursue it immediately or if
they’ll take a small break and get
to it later.”

However, Waters said the lack
of a full-time director has not sig-
nificantly diminished public
safety’s abilities. Waters said the
current deadlock in the search
for a director has allowed Pitt’s
-public safety department to con-
centrate on expanding its ser-
vices. “it's really not that frustrat-
ing not having Ia full-time direc-
tori." \Y’aters sziid.

“We’ve hired 10 more officers,

we plan to start a bike patrol

we’re trying to take a very pro-

Janice Minnich, assistant to Pitt
Associate Vice Chancellor for
Business john DeVitto, said her
department is fairly optimistic
too, despite the search’s lack of
results. “I work very closely with

Minnich also said the director
of Public Safety search commit-
tee will meet again Friday, Feb.
11, to review additional appli-
cants for the position.

“There are 110 applicants so
far, and we’re looking through
all of them,” Minnich said. “We’ll

tions.”

Museum

Continued from page I

This is a scene from the U.S.
Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C. Last Sunday,
about 20 students representing
student organizations visited the
museum as part of a Jewish
Community Relations Commit-
tee trip.

“We wanted to use the
lessons of the Holocaust and
apply it to the race relations on
ca1npus,” said Rob Sohn, chair
of the JCRC. “We want to try to
use the Holocaust to understand
what can happen if prejudice
and racism go too far.” The
museum has four floors, and
many agreed that it could have
been a two-day experience.

Upon arrival, each visitor was
given a small card with the pic-

ture and biography of a victim »

of the Holocaust. The cards,

which are matched up with the -

sex and age of the visitor,
helped to put the tragedy in
perspective.

Some of the highlights of the
museum included a full—sized
mock—up of the cattle cars that
transported people to the con-
centration camps, an hour-long
movie of Holocaust survivors
telling their stories and the Hall
of Shoes. When most of the
people went into the Hall of
Shoes, they were disoriented at
first. The room was very long,
over 100 feet. On each side
were piles and piles of leather

shoes, remnants of those who
died in the camps.

“The room of shoes was the
hardest thing to see,” said
Katrina Wahus, representative
of the Roman Catholic Oratory.

Other examples of Holocaust
remnants were the piles of eye-
glasses and the piles of combs
and brushes taken from the
dead in the camps.

One particular room had in
it only a picture. It was a
warehouse filled with piles of
hair, all textures and colors —
all of which came from
the corpses in the concentration
camps. The plaque said that
the hair was very popular
for German manufacturers
because it was so cheap to pur-
chase.

The “race determining” tools

were featured in another dis-
play which held the interest of
many. There were two pairs of
calipers — one to measure head
size and the other, nose width.
These, combined with eye and
hair color charts, were worked
into an equation for the Nazis to
detemiine who was Aryan and 1
who had to be destroyed.
Flanking these tools were mug
shots of men and women from
all races as examples of what
was and was not Aryan.
According to Julie Crowell,
representative of the Student
Government Board, the
museum was like a roller-
coaster ride mixing the horrible
with the heroic. While the
first two floors concentrated
on the horrors of the war,
the third floor was devoted

major,” and Koch said his par-

ents wondered if it was “a cop-

out.”

Although the Liberal Studies
major has existed at Pitt since the
19705, Koloc said the program
was reformed in 199.1. “The fact
that a few students could still
graduate who just floundered
and really didn’t know what in
the world they were interested in
bothered some people.”

Before 1991, A Bachelor of
Arts in Liberal Studies was con-
sidered a generic degree. Abuses
arose when seniors who failed to
fulfill other degree requirements
declared themselves Liberal
Studies majors in order to gradu-
ate.

“I could actually argue that
under the old blanket of Liberal
Studies, I was much more sym-
pathetic to parents who asked,

‘what is that rnajor'?”’ said Koloc.

He said the title of the degree
was changed to Interdisciplinary
Studies to imply that “'it’s more
concentrated. It means you study
a topic from different points of

View. ”

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

PERSPECTWE

Abortion law unjust

In 1989 Pennsylvania passed a restrictive abortion
law which has yet to be enforced because of court
challenges. But after a decision made by Supreme
Court Justice David H. Souter Monday night, enforce-
ment of this law can no longerbe postponed.

The as-of—now effective law requires that women
must receive medical counseling before having an
abortion, and afterwards are forced to wait another
24 hours before they can get the abortion. The law
also forces women, who are under 18 and unmarried,
to get permission from one parent or a judge’s order
if they want to have an abortion.

Director for Public Affairs Jacqueline Brinkley of
Planned Parenthood Southeastern said that “the law
was intended to make abortion inaccessible, and that
it would mainly effect the poor and the young.” (New
Yor/<2 T2’ mes)

The decision to havean abortion can be a very diffi-
cult one, and women who are young or poor (or

' often both) face enough problems already. This law

can only add more stress to women during a time
when they should be cared for, not forced to wait to
receive a medical procedure or made to hunt down a
permission slip from the judge.

There is no reason why women should have to
experience these unfair and unnecessary require-
ments which ‘hinder their legal rights. Special consid-
erations should not be made for this particular proce-
dure merely on the basis of the morality of others.

This law also presupposes that women arenot
capable of making the decision to have an abortion
on their own. Although, like any medical treatment,
having an abortion should be a private affair, every-
one wants to have a say. With the enactment of this
law, women who~want to have an abortion in
Pennsylvania now have even more people involved
in their decision. .

In the past, many women had to deal with the vio-
lence and interference of anti—abortion protestors
whenever they tried to enter a clinic. But last month a
step was taken to combat this problem when the
Supreme Court ruled that people viol.ently protesting
or committing other crimes in front of abortion facili-
ties could be brought up on racketeering charges,
which means stricter penalties for such criminals.

Abortion advocates in Pennsylvania requested that
the abortion laws be postponed until the Supreme
Court decides whether or not to review them. In
keeping with their protection of the rights of women
who plan to have an abortion, the Supreme Court
should review and reverse the law that puts undue
and unjust stress on women who have made the deci-
sion to have an abortion.

Liberals and

I celebrated a birthday this
past month. On Jan." 26, 18 years
ago, one Booker T.-Stallworth,
Jr. was brought in to the world.
Well after following the news as
carefully as I did this past week,
I’ve come to the conclusion that
if there is one “truth” that I have
learned in all my 18 years, it’s
that liberals are the most hypo-
critical people in all the world.

Just when I was ready to con-
cede that maybe the double
standard, media bias and intel-
lectual hypocrisy were fading
away, we get weeks — no,
months -— like the one that just
passed. Let’s examine it, shall
we?

The Economy. How short can
the public’s memory be? We
seem to presently be in a state
of economic recovery. The
deficit also appears smaller.
W/ho could argue with the effec-
tiveness of Clintonomics? I can!
Clinton taking credit for this
economic recovery in his State
of the Union Address was noth-
ing short of a bold—faced lie!
The State of the Union Address
was made on Jan. 25. The key
thing to remember is that
Clinton’s economic plan didn’t
go into effect until Jan. 1. 1994,
and all the economic indicators
were from prior to Dec, 1993.
Who do you think you’re fool-
ing, Mr. President? NAFTA
didn’t go into effect until Jan. 1
either. Remember how the Bush
campaign told us that the econ-
omy was improving — the
numbers just weren’t out yet?
And remember how after the
election, the economy did
indeed improve?

Clinton is just the lucky inher-
itor of a Bush and global eco-
nomic recovery. And this whole
deal about the deficit. Bill
Clinton reﬁnanced the debt on a
6 percent short-term bond,
which makes the deficit appear
smaller, but will only collapse in
a matter of up to five ‘years.
Bush did it. Carter did it. It’s
nothing new, and it will not
solve any real long-term prob-
lems.

media, most hypocritical

Oh and by the way, if it just
happens to be true that the
deficit is indeed smaller,
where’s our middle-class tax
cut? After all, the only reason
we didn’t get it was because
those nasty Republicans lied
about the size of the deficit.
Yeah, right. *

Then there’s the new Clinton
budget. It’s being heralded as

this great slashing of spending

— more similar to a Republican
budget than a Democrats (as
stated on many Sunday talk

 

er.

 

shows). However the truth lies
in the statement made by
Kweisi Mfume, chairman of the
Congressional Black Caucus on
this past Sunday’s “Meet The
Press.” When asked if he was
worried about Clinton being a
“new Democrat," he made a
comparison to the introduction
of new Coke: it was the same
thing in a new package. Every
Clinton spending cut proposed
will be reassigned to new
“investments” (read: spending).
That’s if he gets the cuts. Every
proposed cut was also pro-
posed by Presidents Reagan and
Bush; neither of them got the
cuts.

And just wait. Clinton’s been
fighting hard to make sure his
health care package is kept off
the budget. On Feb. 7, it was
announced that the Office of
Management and Budget was
demanding that health care be
in the budget — taxes and all.
T hat’s right, taxes, and they’re
not on cigarettes. That’s why
Clinton didn’t want to place any
of the financing on record in the
budget. In the words of

President Bush: “Watch your
wallet  ‘cause his figures don’t
add up and he’s gonna sock it
right to the middle class.”

Then there is the treatment of
Oliver North.

Can you believe that these
same people who said character
was not an issue are now calling
Virginia Senatorial candidate
‘North a liar? This is the same
crowd that has sat back and
watched the Clintons “lose”
records of health care meetings,
lie about a middle class tax cut
and a Variety of different issues.
This is the same crowd who
attempted V to cover up
Whitewatergate, because it
wasn’t “real news,” it was char-
acter. I’m glad the liberals final-
ly accepted character as an
issue, because I’m willing to
match the character of Oliver
North up against that of the
Clintons, the Kennedys or any
of the other Washington liberal
core. Oliver North did-what he
thought was best for this coun-
try. Bill Clinton and Ted
Kennedy did what was in the
best interest of themselves.

Where is the media on this?
Where is the media on Foster’s
death, which is looking more
and more like murder? Where
were they when Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told the
Japanese to lower taxes to spur
their economy (Reaganomics),
and told America to raise taxes
to spur its economy
(Clintonomics)? Now where
were they with Watergate, and
Iran-Contra, and Packwood. It’s
a double standard, and I’m sick
of it!

Don’t buy into this. We have
to be smarter than this. I’m
insulted that our government
and media thinks so little of us
that they think we won’t
remember simple things like the
date Clinton’s plan went into
effect. They think they can lie to
us and get away with it. I beg of
you, don’t let them.

Booleer T. Stallworth is con-
cerned about his nation. and
wishes you were too.

Aggelou

wee/es with

Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

The Pitt basketball team

was dealt a severe blow
this week when freshman
shooting guard Sotiris
Aggelou injured his left
;wrist Sunday during prac-
tice. Aggelou was
attempting a lay-up when
he collided with team-
mates and fell to the ﬂoor
during a scrimmage.

“I was in the air and got
hit,” Aggelou said.

“It was no different
from any other fall. I just
fell on my wrist too hard.”

Aggelou, who will con-
tinue conditioning with
the team Monday, will be
out from 4-6 weeks. .

The native of Greece
almost single-handedly
brought Pitt back into
their loss against Syracuse
on Saturday. He hit a pair
of threes, plus eight
straight foul shots late in
the game.

He had slowly seen
more playing time,
including two starts, but
might not be back until
after the Big East.

  Pitts sharpshooter /ma,’ begun to find his nick {and shot)

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

For the past few seasons, Pitt
has been searching for outside
shooting. Injuries, lack of depth
and inconsistency have plagued
the Panthers’ guards.

Coach Paul Evans had finally
found the answer this season.
He isn’t from the playgrounds of
Los Angeles, Chicago or even
New York.

Would you believe Greece?

Right up until he broke his
left wrist in Sunday’s practice,
an injury that will keep him out
four to six weeks, rookie guard
Sotiris Aggelou was the sharp-
shooter Pitt basketball has
needed for the past few years.

Aggelou is a native of Athens,
Greece who has supplied
instant offense off the Panther’
bench since the beginning of
the season.

The 6-foot-3-inch import pos-
sesses a deadly outside shot
with almost limitless range. But
Aggelou has not always been a
shooting phenom.

“When I was 10 or 11, I
played inside,” Aggelou said. “I
was taller than everyone else.”

But everyone else caught up,
and Aggelou realized that his
future was from beyond the
three-point arc.

“My outside shot was some-
thing I worked on when I got
serious for my first club team,”
Aggelou said.

In fact, he is currently a hot
commodity in Greece, where a
number of pro teams have
offered him lucrative contracts.
He briefly entertained the
thought of joining his older
brother Legalis in the Greek Pro
League, but decided to take his
game to the United States.

He came to the United States
in September of ‘92 after Gus
Sariandes, athletic director at
the American School in Athens,
Greece, contacted Metro Index
scout Joe Butler about sending
Aggelou to participate in the
prestigious Metro Index Camp
in California, Pa.

Aggelou dazzled coaches at
Metro and could have chosen to
attend practically any high
school he wished as a foreign
exchange student.

He chose Riverside (Pa) High
School at random.

“I just closed my eyes and

picked,” Aggelou said. “I really
didn’t know too much about
Riverside. All I wanted to do
was graduate and pass my
SAT’s.” '

Aggelou became an instant
star under the direction of head
coach Brad Ovial. He averaged
25 points a game while leading
Riverside to a 17-6 mark and
their first playoff appearance in
years. '

His school record of 66 three
pointers in only 25 games
caught the eye of scouts, and he
was heavily recruited.

“At first, it was mostly small
schools,” Aggelou said. “But
when people saw my stats,
large schools became interest-
ed."”

Boston College, Seton Hall,
Georgetown, Temple, Kansas
and Villanova were among the
schools interested, but Aggelou
chose Pitt.

“They had been recruiting me
for 8 months,” he said. “It’s also
close to home.” ‘

“Home” is Beaver Falls, Pa.
with the Conner family who
took him in as a foreign
exchange student in high

Is Mario Audi SK? Will UN C repeat? Is Shawn Bradley that bac?

Your local sports fiend answers these questions and more —— much more — in this installment of ...The Fondrk Files

Enough is enough. I am
speaking for myself and proba-
bly half the nation. I’m sick and
tired of hearing about Tonya
Harding. Tonya this, Tonya that.
It’s gotten so bad that people
are bringing up the fact that she
has overdue library books. Who
cares? Regardless, it all boils
down to this: representing the
United States is supposed to be
an honor, not a task. Harding
has lost the honor ——— she should
avoid the media circus and
gracefully bow out.

-Another person who has
gotten a little too much media
coverage: Michael Jordan.
Yesterday, his Airness signed a
minor league contract with the
White Sox and was invited to
spring training as a non—roster
player. The media has followed

him everywhere. Sure, the pub-
lic is interested in Jordan. He
may be the most popular athlete
of all time, but let’s get serious
— Jordan won’t make the open-
ing day roster. This is too much
hoopla just so he can get sent to
the minors. Even an athlete with
M]’s immense talent cannot
expect to make a major league
roster with only two months of
workouts at Comiskey Park
under his belt. I still think
Michael will be playing a sport
that he excels at next year, and
it won’t be golf. He should take
a cue from the Nike Kilroy com-
mercials that ran during the
Super Bowl and return to the
hardwood.

Catalano makes Chang baa/e to Pittsbu rs

By Dan Lauso -

Sometimes a change of
scenery in one’s life makes all
the difference in-one’s perfor-
mance.

Sometimes the only change in
one’s life that is needed is
returning to that most wonder-

After all, Dorothy told us
“There’s no place like home,” in
The Wizard of OZ.. Bruce
Springsteen sang of the child-
hood joys he experienced in the
song “My Hometown.”

For the Pitt wrestling team’s
Rich Catalano, returning home
this season translated into a
career year and a season most
wrestlers can only dream of.

As of Feb. 2, Catalano is an
outstanding 18-1 for the season
and arguably the anchor of the
1993-94 Panther wrestling team.

studies major, Catalano takes a
workman—like approach to his
wrestling matches.

‘‘I try and stay calm and not
make too big of a deal out of it,"
Catalano said. “I just try and not
think about it (the match) so its
second nature and fun.”

Catalano’s prominent role on
the Panther wrestling team
stems from his domination in
the 167 lbs. weight class.

Quickness, upper—body
strength and finesse are
Catalano’s physical attributes on
the mat.

But what about the intangi-
bles to Catalano’s wrestling? The
traits that can’t be measured by
a win-loss record or a weight
machine? .

Desire, heart, confidence and
intelligence make Catalano one
of the top wrestlers in the 167
class.

His academic record has
proven that there is a great deal
of brains behind the brawn of
Catalano.

The Athletic Directors’ Honor
Roll named Catalano to its list
this year. The achievement indi-
cates that Catalano obtained a
5.0—or—better G.P.A. in the past
fall semester.

“He still enjoys wrestling the
most,” Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “He just loves
to Wrestle. Here he knows'he’s
going to wrestle. Whether he
gets bumped up a weight or
not, you have to put your best
against your opponents best.”

Along with his love of
Wrestling, Catalano displays a
strong work ethic and devotion
to his team.

“He’s done everything we’ve
asked of him,” Stottlemyer said.
“He works his butt off for us.”

Many times this season, with
his team trailing, Catalano pro-
vided the shot in the arm the
team has needed to spark

Atlanta await

By Ed Ziegenfuss

For The Pitt News

Lost in the depths of the large
gym in Trees Hall he trains.
Faithfully working day-in and
day-out to perfect his routines.
He is men’s gymnast Genaro
Severino.

Genaro was born in Porto
Alegre, Brazil. He began gym-
nastics when he was young
because, “I was always getting
hurt from falling down, so my
mother told me I had to learn
how to fall.” Genaro left home
at the age of 14 to train at one of
the free Olympic training cen-
ters located in Brazil. It was
there, under the guidance of
skilled coaches, that Genaro
learned his skills. Since there
was no gymnastic competition
at the high school level in
Brazil, Severino was forced to
compete with the local club
team. At the’ tender age of 16,
Genaro finished 10th in the
vault at the Junior World
Championships.

In 1988 Genaro began his life
in the United States. His first
stop was at Northern Illinois
University.

Genaro competed there for
one year but was forced to
transfer when the men’s gym-
nastic program was dropped.
The three schools interested in
attaining Severino were
California State University-
Fullerton, California State
University-Santa Barbara, and
Pitt.

Genaro soon was wearing the
blue and gold of the Panthers
because he was attracted to the
team atmosphere of the gym-
nastics program.

“Here at Pitt it was friendship

routines, Panther coach Frank
D’Amico has taught Genaro and
the rest of the team that safer
routines done well lead to high-
er scores. This theory has obvi-
ously helped Genaro over the
years. 1

Winning awards is nothing
new to Genaro. Besides placing
10th at the Junior World
Championships he was an alter-
nate for the Brazilian Olympic
gymnastics team. In his «college
career at Northern Illinois
Severino attended the NCAA
National Championships, but an
injury kept him out of the finals.

At Pitt Genaro holds the team
records in the all-around and
the rings.

He has been all-around cham-
pion of the ECAC for two years
in a row. A year ago he won the
vault at NCAA Regionals and
placed fourth at the National
Championships in the vault.
This accomplishment gave
Genaro All—American status.
However fantastic all of these
awards may be, Genaro is most
proud of two other accomplish-
ments.

The first is coming back from
a severe ankle injury in his
junior year to achieve his All-
American status last year after

 

s Pitt's star gymnast

being red-shirted.

The second accomplishment
is qualifying for the athletic
departments academic honor
roll.

In his final season in
Pittsburgh, Genaro is again
leading the Panthers.

In their first home meet of the
season on January 22 vs.
Radford, Severino won the all-
around title by taking five out of
the six events (all except the
pommel horse). Genaro hopes
to accomplish two things this
year, achieving All-American
status on the rings and again in
the vault. He has planned out
his season and feels confident
that he can get it done.

After this year Genaro will go
back to Brazil to get a job.

He hopes that a coaching
position will open up at one of
the club teams or that he can
get together with the right
coaches and train for the next
summer Olympics.

Who would have thought that
the road to Atlanta 1996 could
lead through Trees Hall?

The men’s gymnastic team
will have its next home meet on
Saturday Feb. 12 at 1 p.m. in
Trees Hall vs. James

Madison.

rMz'le relay qualzfiesfor

ECAC’s while restof tmc/e
team wins at Hozrdees

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer
On Feb.’ 5, the Lady

Panthers of Pitt’s track and
field team competed in the
15th Annual Hardee’s Track
Classic without Angie Martin,
LaKeya Smith, Kim Blair and
Allison Williams.

The foursome was busy
winning the mile relay in the
Mobil One Invitational in
Fairfax, Va.

They were not missed, as
Pitt came home with eight
first—place finishes.

“We had great big fun,”
head coach Steve Lewis said.

“I think that team-wise,
this might have been one of
the best and most dominant
showings of any meet.
Everybody had a good time.

"We had a couple of [per-
sonal records] and a couple
of ECAC qualifying times.”

Sophomore Najuma
Fletcher stole the show as

she competed in the field
events.

Fletcher took first in the
long jump with a leap of 20
feet and 5 inches, breaking
the Field House, meet and
school records.

Despite only taking a pair
of attempts in the high jump,
Fletcher still dominated the
competition with a winning
height of 5-6.

In the triple jump, Pitt’s
Genniku Washington gave
Fletcher her only individual
defeat of the day.
Washington’s victorious
jump of 38-4 1/2 qualified
her for the ECAC’s.

Fletcher placed third with
a jump of 36-8.

The Lady Panthers also
performed well in the track
events.

Junior Staci Suggs easily
won the 55-meter hurdlers
with a time of 8.13 seconds,
while Tonya Mullins took
second with a time of 8.42

ries.

“Rich doesn’t say any-
thing to anybody but has
gained everybody’s
respect,” Stottlemyer said.

For a quiet person,
Catalano’s release comes
when he steps onto the
mat.

How does a wrestler
come down from the
manic highs that a one
endures during a high-
tension match?

For Catalano, relaxation
means taking in a lot of
movies.

Perhaps all the comforts
that only one’s home can
provide have inspired
Catalano into one terrific
season.

“I made the right
choice. I'm glad to be
back (home).”

The Panthers are equal-
ly glad to have him home.

action a few months ago at the
Spectrum. The Sixers played the
Jazz. The minute he stepped on
the court he was greeted with a
chorus of boos. The jeering only
got louder as the game went on.
Bradley got toasted on defense,
almost broken in half by Karl
Malone and looked like he had
no idea where he was. As the
game progressed, he got flus-
tered and played even worse.
Finally, Coach Fred Carter
yanked him and ended the car-
nage. To his credit, he has
played better lately. In fact, he
may be good someday, but
Sixer fans want a winner today.
They passed on names such as
Hardaway and Mashbum in the
draft. These areimpact guys
who could have helped Philly
win today, not five years down
the road. But you must remem-
ber, this is the same team that
signed Manute Bol.

inside or behind the Pitt
defense on the fast break.

“We’re at our best when
the big guys are running.”
Abdullah said. “That’s my
job, to get them the ball.”

Providence capped the
streak with a 15-0 run until
Panther power forwa.rd
Willie Cauley scored onian
alley-oop. That began a‘7-0
Pitt run as the half came to a
close, but Friar guard
Michael Brown responded
with his third trey of the half
to give Providence a 44-27
halftime lead.

Pitt pulled within 46-32 as
shooting guard Ahmad
Shareef drove in for a slam,
but Smith responded with
four straight points — two
free throws and an Eric
Mobley goaltend — to spark
another Providence run, this
one a 13-0 streak that put the
Friars up 61-32. ‘

Halfway through that, only
four minutes into the half,
Mobley took Pitt’s seventh
foul of the half, putting the
Friars in the one-and-one. By

the time Providence took its
largest lead at 69-39, the
Friars had hit 13 of 16 free

throws while Pitt had
drained only four of
seven.

Pitt responded to the 30-
point hole with a 9-0 run on
two buckets by Chris Gant,
one by Shareef and another
trey from Maile.

The Panthers, sparked by
Jerry McCullough’s (12
points) defense and three-
point shooting, chipped
away from there, getting as
close as 73-60 before Smith
closed the door.

Smith grabbed an offen-
sive rebound, his tenth
rebound in the contest, and
was fouled by Jaime
Peterson. Smith hit the free
throws to raise the edge to

15 points.
Moments later, with the
score 75-65 Friars,

McCullough missed a three-

- pointer that could have cut

the lead to 11. Smith found
an opening for a slam on the
other end to seal the
Providence victory.

school. Jasen Conner played
basketball with Aggelou in high
school and is currently his
roommate at Pitt.

Aggelou showed Pittsburgh
basketball fans what they were
getting when he won the three-
point contest at the Dapper Dan
Roundball Classic.

Aggelou prepared for his first
year of college ball in the
United States by playing against
some of the stiffest competition
that Greece had to offer.

“I played in the Greek sum-
mer on a team called Agex,”
Aggelou said. “Most of the play-
ers were older, and many were
professionals."

He also improved his
strength, something that is nec-
essary to be successful in the
Big East. »

However, his conditioning
and hard work still could not
simulate the level of competi-
tion in the United States.

“I knew I was here when I got
five shots blocked in my first
game against Marathon Oil,” he
said. “Nobody is that quick in
Europe.”

“The European game is more

I finesse,” Aggelou said. "Teams

play better defense here. I’m
still trying to adjust my game.”
Although Aggelou has had to
adjust his game, he hasn’t had
to tamper with his work ethic.
Pitt coaches have said time and
time again that he is one of the
hardest workers on the team.
He realizes that he must

, improve his defense if he is to

become an everyday player.

“I was worried more about
offense in high school. It is
much more difficult to guard
someone here,” he said.

“I have to work on my one-
on-one moves," he said. “The
coaches have stressed that I
have to learn how to create my
own shot.”

“His shot” is why he is here.
Aggelou has started three
games, but he is primarily used
off the bench to provide instant
scoring.

“I love to shoot the ball,” he
said. “I would rather pull tip
and shoot a three than dunk.”

And he is not afraid to shoot.
He is averaging 17 minutes and
6.2 points a game off the bench.

Saturday against Syracuse, he

came off the bench and scored

14 points in the final six minutes
to keep Pitt close in a game that
had become an Orangemen
rout. Aggelou hit two three-
pointers with under a minute
left. The second one pulled the
Panthers to within three at 75-72
with 1:12 remaining. Pitt even-
tually lost 80-77, but it is clear
that the coaches have plenty of
faith in their prized rookie.

Everything is going smoothly
on the court for Aggelou, and it
is apparently going equally as
smoothly off.

“I’m enjoying my time here.
Everyone has helped me out.
The people have been really
nice."

What about Aggelou’s future?

“I’m not even thinking about
that right now. I’m more con-
cerned with helping us win
today."
