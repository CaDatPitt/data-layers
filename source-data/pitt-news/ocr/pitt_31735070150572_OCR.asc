Pitt stuns
Hokies  

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Senior running back Ray Graham
planted his left foot into_ the ground
and juked right, faking Virginia Tech’s
Kyshoenjarrett to the ground. Gra-
ham beat all other Hokie defenders
to the pylon for the ﬁrst-drive touch-
down. " »

Pitt never looked back from that
early touchdown, cruising out to a
21-0 lead. Both the offense and the
defense came up with big plays when
they needed to as the Panthers took
home theirﬁrstwin of the season, 35-’
17, over No. 13 Virginia Techat Heinz
Field on Saturday afternoon. *

“It’s always good when you get off
to a fast start,” ﬁrst-year head coach
Paul Chryst said. “Any time you move
the ball down the ﬁeld and score, it’s
a great way to start a game. You’d like
to do it every time.” _.

The Panthers’ second scoring
drive followed the same pattern as
their first, combining a strong run-
ning game andtimely passes, and Pitt
_doubled its lead when senior quar-
terback Tino Sunseri found Devin
Street for a 13-yard touchdown after
the junior receiver beat his man.

Sunseri had one of the top games
of his career, completing 19—of-28
passes for three touchdowns and
283 yards.

“He threw the ball very, very
well,” Virginia Tech head coach Frank
Beamer said of Sunseri. “He was on
the money, and anytime there is that
much success, I think we helped him
a bit.”

Pitt’s defense then forced several‘
turnovers as the Panthers took con-
trol of the game.

Chryst credited his defense for
recording three interceptions and
recovering afumble.

Oakland hosted the nation’s sec-
ond lady on Sunday, if only for a
few minutes.

Following her appearance at a
Women for Obama-Biden event
in the Strip District, Jill Biden,
English professor and wife of Vice
Presidentjoe Biden, made a quick
stop for a meet-and-greet with
student workers at the Obama
Campaign’s ﬁeld office in Oakland
this weekend.

Congresswoman Debbie Was-
serman Schultz, D-Florida, joined
Dr. Biden in discussing women’s
issues in the upcoming presiden-
tial election at the campaign event
Sunday morning.

discuss election issues affecting women

Held at the Obama Campaign’s
Pittsburgh headquarters on
Smallman Street in the Strip, the
event attracted about 300 sup-
porters.

Wasserman Schultz addressed
the crowd ﬁrst, stressing the im-

portance of health care to this

campaign. Relating the topic to

‘her personal experiences as a

breast ,cancer survivor, the con-
gresswoman told the crowd a
story about how, while working
on the ﬁrst Obama campaign and
being treated for breast cancer in
2008, Biden wrote her. a personal
note of encouragement and sup-
port.

“That’s an example of the kind
of real people thatjill andjoe are,”
Wasserman Schultz said.

She went on to enumerate
ways in which _Obama’s health
care act has supported women’s
issues, such as through legislation
covering contraception under
health insurance.

“There are powerful forces out
there who want to turn back the
clock for women and women’s is-
sues,” Wasserman Schultz added.

Biden, who grew up. in Willow
Grove, Pa., spoke next, also em-
phasizing the ways that her hus-
band and the president have sup-
ported women politically. Biden
mentioned the Violence Against

,Women Act, which her husband

drafted, and Obamas’ support of

Chairwoman for the Democratic
National Committee Debbie Was-
serman Schultz stopped in Pitts-
burgh on Saturday to rally local
volunteers and remind Obama
supporters that the clock is tick-
ing.

"‘We have 52 days,” Wasserman
Schultz said. “Fifty-two days to
make sure that Pennsy1vania’s vot-
ers know what’s at stake  And
for young people, there has really
never been more at stake.”

A crowd of about 60 volun-

-teers and staffers, mostly col-

lege students from Pitt, CMU and
Point Park University, sat on easy
chairs and couches at the Obama

V campaign oﬂice on the corner of

Forbes Avenue and Atwood Street.
In the middle of a sparsely deco-
rated loft, the Congresswoman
spoke about campaign issues
geared toward college students.
On Sunday, she would appear with
Jill Biden, the wife of Vice Presi-
dentjoe Biden, at an event at the
Obama for America ﬁeld office on
Smallman Street.

“The other side has made
clear what their most important
resource is  money,” she said.
“What’s ours?” a

“People,” the crowd answered
back.

which targets pay differences be-
tween men and women. Biden
also pointed out that the presi-
dent has appointed more women
to be federal judges than any of his
predecessors.

As a self—described “woman
who votes,” Biden said in her
speech, “For women of my gen-
eration, one thing is certain: We
can’t go back and reﬁght the bat-
tles we fought decades ago.”

The event ended with Was-
serman Schultz calling on all in
attendance to volunteer as much
of their time as they can spare at
the campaign office during the re-
maining 51 days before Nov. 6. The
audience responded by breaking
into a chant of “four more years!”

After the event, Biden was off
to Oakland to meet with students
volunteering in the campaign of-
ﬁce at Forbes Avenue and Atwood
Street. The second lady arrived

with donuts for the 50 students

who had come out to see her.

“I brought donuts because
you’ve been working hard,” she
said.

Biden stayed for another few
minutes,‘ brieﬂy addressing the
group and then shaking hands
with and speaking to some of the
students in attendance.'

The Oakland campaign office
employs two full-time staffers and
has 20 student interns.

Matt Mittenthal, the Obama
Campaign’s press secretary for
western Pennsylvania, said the
campaign is running ﬁve ' offices
in Allegheny County that are open
seven days a week. He said the
campaign considers Pennsylvania
to be a critical swing state.

Pitt Democrats president Lara
Sullivan attended the event and
said it was an honor to have the
second lady at the ofﬁce, even if it
was only for a few minutes.

“It gets students excited, and it
goes to show students how impor-
tant they really are,” Sullivan said.

She also attacked Republican presiden-

Chris Wilson, a senior and political sci-

on behalf of the campaign with Pitt College

Wilson said his experience phone bank-

Wilson described how he has witnessed
the effects of recent voter ID laws.

“There was this old lady, and she was

frustrations.

THE STAMATTACK

OPINIONS .‘

Increasing federal aid makes college
less affordable in the

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opinions Editor

I am pretty conﬁdent that if I
walked around campus today and
offered students free money for
tuition,’ the response would be
overwhelmingly positive.
Attending college is expen-
sive, after all. Increasing Pell
Grants, Stafford or Perkins Loans

would make millions of students ’

today much better off.

But before we dole out free
cash, remember why people need
money in the ﬁrst place: The re-
sources required to run a univer-

sity — the faculty, the buildings,‘

the information technology —

' keep getting more expensive. To

produce one educated student

today costs more than it did ten -

years ago.
So to make college more af-
fordable, we have to make col-

lege more efficient. We have to

educate better for less. And this
is why blanket increases in fund-
ing for students are a bad idea.
They are great for making things
more affordable for a bit, but on
the basis of making college more

, eﬂicient, they fail miserably.

In fact, the explosion of Pell
Grants, low interest rate loans
and other aid programs might be
responsible for the affordability
crises we face today.

Consider the decision thou-
sands of colleges face‘ when of-
fered federal aid. Ideally, an in-
-crease of $500 per student makes
tuition $500 cheaper. And for the
ﬁrst year, itmight.

But ﬂooded with cash, univer- H

sities quickly make investments
in new buildings and-programs.
Suddenly, they have invested that
$500, and the student price is the
same, not cheaper.

Most importantly, the effi-
ciency of the institution has de-
creased, and a single student’s

education now uses more re-

sources. Eventually this efﬁcien-
cy loss catches up to the school,

and tuition has to expand, lead--

ing to more aid requirements and
continuing the cycle.
Now all institutions, educa-

tion—related or not, need to make
investments to improve capabili-
ties and grow: Factories invest in
new assembly lines, and Apple
invests in new technology for a
reason.

All these investments reap re-
turn. But there is a self-imposed
limit to the number of possible

‘investments when projects are’

ﬁnanced through typical chan-
nels. »To justifya small price in-
crease or lack of price decrease in
a private company, touch-screen
technology or new factory capac-
ity has to pay off quickly.

Lower and
middle-class
families can

still have

access to loans
and grants

[...],' but the
formula for aid
must drastically

change.

But at a university level, no in-
vestment needs to pay for itself.
Five hundred dollars in Pell Grant ‘
money can go toward programs
that only bring $200 in student
beneﬁt. Students won’t get upset
at the $300 difference — they
aren’t paying for it, at least now.
The school has simply become
$200 more valuable.

Competent university admin-
istrators make uneconomic de-
cisions, simply because their in-
centive is to make lesser—quality
investments rather than no in-
vestments at all. For a president
or provost to not take money
would be foolish — every other
school is taking the money, and
they have to compete with other

ong run

school’s $200 projects.

This cycle of aid and cost ex-
pansion is a better explanation
for increased costs than the claim
that government funding has just
been cut off — mainly‘ because
the government spends more
today than ever. While states
are pulling back, the feds have
stepped in, especially in ﬁnancial
aid, now supporting 71 percent of

spending — up 10 percent from

a decade ago. Most increased
are low-interest federal loans,
which provide time-adjusted free

money: The federal government

supports $400‘ billion more in
student debt than in 2008.

Thus, we have today’s situa-
tion. Average tuition has risen 15
percent between 2008 and 2010,
with two-thirds of the cost being
absorbed by those with higher
incomes and the government, ac-
cording to the U.S. Department
of Education. More alarmingly,
colleges are less efficient: There
is no evidence this 15—percent in-
crease has improved outcomesby
15 percent. Students and taxpay-
ers are simply saddled with the
debt and required to take part in
a bloated system.

There is no simple solution to
this problem, but there are ways
to. move forward without com-
pletely ending aid. Lower and
middle-class families can still
have access to loans and grants
without placing upward pressure
on the cost of college, but the
formula for aid must drastically
change.

Currently, aid is awarded

_based on a calculation of esti-

mated possible family contribu-
tion subtracted from the cost to
attend a school. A student at a
high—cost school generally re-
ceives more than a student at a
low-cost school; the government
makes up some of the difference.
Instead, ‘ ﬁnancial reward
shouldbe a block grant that stays
with the student, remaining un-
changed regardless of the price of
the school. The education would
still be subsidized, but students

Stamatakisl e 7

STAMATAKIS

would be more vulnerable to cost increas-
es.

While this sounds terrifying, it would
for the ﬁrst time give universities a real in-
centive to stop tuition increases. Instead of
attracting peoplewith $200 investments in
gyms, dorms and unproﬁtable programs,
universities could attract people by say-
ing their tuition dropped by $500. To at-
tract better minds, schools could offer no-
increase guarantees to students worried
their tuition might jump after sophomore
year. Costs would grow more slowly.

The quality of investments would in-
crease too. Increased spending in a math
center would need to lead to better stu-

' dent outcomes at graduation because these

new costs would be directly felt in tuition.
And if it turns out effective students truly
do require $50,000 worth of investment,
traditional private lenders can still provide
loans, just with a higher level of conﬁdence
that they’ll get their money back.

Higher education pays off: Those with
degrees have better job prospects than

' S those without degrees on average. But just

because it pays ofﬂ doesn’t mean more of
student’s education should be subsidized
without pause; reforms in ﬁnancial aid
mechanisms are needed to_stop tuition’s
eternal march upward. ' _ .

LETTERS TOATHE EDITOR

To the Editor,

I wish to take issue with Eric Baldwin’s

column concerning the Chick—ﬁl—A debate in
the Aug. 29, 2012, issue of The Pitt News. He
argues there is room for now calling opposi-
tion to gay marriage ‘hate speech’ —~ creat-
ing a chilling effect on free speech — and for
going economically after a business because
its owner has certain independent views.
What he does not take into account is that
opposition to something as disgusting and
abnormal as a man marrying a man and a
woman marrying a woman is held by large
historic bodies such as the Catholic Church.
I am not saying that gays (the word ‘gay’ used
to have a very different meaning) should be
legally forbidden from marrying.

Let me further add that universities have
a sorry record on free speech. ‘fCivility” is’
a pretext for keeping free speech out of the
classroom. In 2009 on the Pitt campus a
student told me to “shut up” when I said to
someone who had broken into the bus line in
front of two older people, “just because you
are an illegal immigrant, doesn’t give you the
right to butt into line.” The bus driver also
went berserk. Her right to free speech in this
situation might actually be questioned.None
of us should forget that the book burnings in
Nazi Germany were conducted by students

. and college professors.

To the Editor,

After reading Eric Baldwin’s piece titled
“America has moved past the time for gun
control discussion,” it was difficult to de-
termine on what, exactly, to comment.
judging by the article, Mr. Baldwin is guilty
of the same misinformed, one-sided logic
he so inadequately attaches to those who
defend the Second Amendment. He claims
that the “discussion [regarding gun con-
trol] needs to revolve around facts,” before
proposing an entirely hypothetical plan
to strip law—abiding American citizens of
a constitutional right. The section of this
plan that calls for prohibiting “urban pop-
ulations” from owning ﬁrearms is beyond
absurd; it betrays either an_ opinion that is
blatantly elitist, or a degree of intellect too
poorly developed to understand a concept
like socioeconomic discrimination.

The line “Eventually, over the course

of the next 50 years, weapons could be
phased out of civilian hands,” struck me as

particularly dystopian. The fact that this ’

idea can gain any traction must be abso-
lutely thrilling for Mr. Obama and his col-

lection of sycophants maintaining our cur— ”

rent regime’s international hegemony. The
crimes of individuals like James Holmes
and Anders Breivik are truly appalling,
yet how many civilians die every year as
the result of American imperialism? These
shooting sprees and mass murders should
not distract us from equally tragic, state-
sanctioned killings happening around the
world every day. Liberals should wake up
and prevent the kind of pseudo—logic dis-
played in Mr. Baldwin’s piece from work-
ing its way into any political discourse that
could aifect policy.

Sepich: Upset victory gives Pitt
football program hope for future

Led by defensive backs Jarred Holley (18) and Jason Hendricks (25), Pitt’s defense dominated No. 13 Vir-
ginia Tech. The Panthers forced four Hokie turnovers in the upset. Sheldon Satenstein | Senior Staff Photographer

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

Maybe life in the Atlantic Coast
Conference won’t be so tough for
Pitt after all.

Maybe No. 13 Virginia Tech
entered Saturday’s game at Heinz
Field vastly overrated.

Or maybe the Panthers just
weren’t as bad as their opening
defeats against Youngstown State
and Cincinnati suggested.

The truth likely lies somewhere
in between, but after the Panthers
stunned the Hokies, 35-17, one
thing is certain: The Pitt football
program and its fans ﬁnally have
hope once again.

To the shock of the 48,032 fans
in attendance, Pitt (1-2, 0-1 Big
East) quickly marched its opening
drive down the ﬁeld, taking the lead
when star running back Ray Gra-
ham conﬁrmed that his surgically

repaired knee was healthy with a

_ quick cut to shake a defender on

his way to the end zone.

While Graham’s contributions
started the upset, it was the im-
proved Pitt defense that helped the
Panthers build a substantial advan-
tage over the 10.5-point favorite
Hokies (2-1, 1-0 ACC).

In the ﬁrst half, the defense re-
corded four turnovers as safeties
Jarred Holley andJason Hendricks
combined for three interceptions,
and redshirt freshman Devin Cook
forced a fumble that redshirt soph-
omore Eric Williams recovered.

Pitt turned those turnovers
into 14 points and would’ve scored
more if kicker Kevin Harper hadn’t
shanked two makeable ﬁeld—goal
attempts.

Quarterback Tino Sunseri -
who ﬁnished 19—for—28 passingfor
283 yards, with three touchdowns
and just one interception — said
converting those turnovers into

points was extremely important for
the Panthers, especially after Pitt
struggled mightily to ﬁnish drives
against Cincinnati last week.

“Today we were able to convert
down in the red zone,” Sunseri said.
“We put ourselves in positions to
be successful, and players made
plays.-” _

On the other side of the ball, big
plays were the only thing that kept
Virginia Tech in the game.

With the Hokies looking to
engineer a comeback in the third
quarter, a 94-yard punt return by
sophomore Kyshoen Jarrett and
an 85-yard touchdown pass from
quarterback Logan Thomas to
wide receiver Marcus Davis cut
into Pitt’s advantage, but Virginia
Tech struggled to consistently
maintain drives as the Panthers’
defensive line dominated much of
the contest. '

With time winding down in the
fourth quarter at Heinz Field on
Saturday, a chorus of “overrated!”
and “Go home, Hokies!” chants rang
out from the Pitt student section.

In perhaps the biggest upset of

the weekendincollege football, ﬁrst-
year head coach Paul Chryst and the
Panthers routed No.13VirginiaTech,
35-17, while erasing all of the fester-
ing frustration following Pitt’s two
abysmal losses to start the ‘season.

Make no mistake, those blem-
ishes against Youngstown State
and Cincinnati are still in the re-
cord book. But they might as well
be buried under old “high octane”
shirts and posters. -

Pitt’s win at home over the previ-
ously undefeated Hokies came as a
day of atonement for the Panthers
involved in the upset.

First and foremost, Chryst
notched his ﬁrst career win as a
head coach, and after the game it
wasn’t hard to see the usually re-
served former quarterback holding

Senior runningback Ray Graham
— a Heisman candidate before tear-
ing his ACL last October — scored
his ﬁrst touchdowns of the season
and was a big part of a Pitt triumph
for the ﬁrst time in more than 10
months.

Rushel Shell, Graham’s freshman
counterpart in the backﬁeld, played
a huge role in a Panther victory for
the ﬁrst time ever.

Barreling through the Virginia
Tech defense for 157 yards on 23 car-
ries, the western Pennsylvania native
left not only linebackers and safeties
in his dust, but also an early season
suspension that sidelinedhimforthe
opener against Youngstown State.

Junior safety Jason Hendricks,
like Graham, was_also having a career

ﬁve games of the season.

game in 2011 before injuring his
shoulder, opened the 2012 season

UPSET

  

Ronald Jones and the Panthers shocked No.13 Virginia Tech on Saturday at Heinz Field,
35-17.>Sheldon Satenstein_| Senior Staff Photographer , ~

A V “Why do you get an [interception]? It has
everything to do with everyoneon the ﬁeld,”
he said. “It can be a defensive back away
from the ball. It can be pressure on the quar-
terback. Those picks are team takeaways.”

‘ After Graham scored his second touch-
down of the game, Beamer turned to a hurry-

up offense, and Virginia Tech was able to get

its ﬁrst points with a 32-yard ﬁeld goal by
Codyjournell.

That ended the ﬁrst half ’s scoring as the
Panthers took a surprise 21-3 lead into the

‘break. ,
Virginia Tech regained some momentum .

whenjarrett ﬁelded a punt from the 6-yard

line and raced down the right sidelinefor

the Hokies’ ﬁrst touchdown.

Down 21-10, the Hokies drove to the Pitt
35-yard line looking to score again. But the
Pitt defense stacked Virginia Tech rushers
up‘ twice at the line of scrimmage, forcing a
turnover on downs. '

“We needed that,” redshirt junior line-
backer Shane Gordon said of that stop.
“Momentum swings when you do stuff like
that. That changed the other team. We got
our offense back on the ﬁeld, and we were
hyped.” '

Riding the defense’s momentum, the of-

fense drove back down the ﬁeld thanks to
running back Rushel Shell.

The talented freshman had a coming—out
party Saturday, going for 159 yards on 23
carries, but he’s already looking forward
to next week. .

5‘This is somethinggto get us right back

A victory.

on track,”-Shell said after the game. “We got
to stop looking at the past. We won. It’s over
with. We got to start looking to next week.”

Sunseri then found Graham on a wheel
route out for an 18-yard touchdown, the
running back’s third score of the game.

But Virginia Tech brought the deﬁcit
back to 11 points when quarterback Logan
Thomas found Marcus Davis over the mid-
dle, and the receiver sprinted for an 85-yard
touchdown. ’

On the second play of the ﬁnal quarter,
Sunseri took a huge hit and‘ threw an inter-
ception, but he returned on the next drive
as the Panthers .capped off the impressive

“He’s a leader,” Shell said of Pitt’s quar-
terback. “On and off the ﬁeld, he’s a good
guy. Today he showed everyone. He was hurt,
came in and fought through that injury. We
respect that. That’s something you want out
of your quarterback.”

On Pitt’s ﬁnal drive, Sunseri found Mike
Shanahan — who caught ﬁve catches for

111 yards on the day — for the touchdown v  I V c  m u S
in the back of the end zone. .

The Panthers and their coach are com-
paring the season to a journey. While the win
doesn’t»erase the earlier losses, it does help

-the team View the struggles as something ‘

c that built them to this point.

“You can’t get to one part of [the season]
without getting through others,” Chryst said.
“We did what we needed to do. Everything
you go through builds yo_u, and our guys
responded today.”

overs the Panthers forced, were the ﬁrst signs
of life the Pitt defense has shown under Chryst.

Early on in the fourth quarter, senior wide
receiver Mike Shanahan dropped a perfectly
thrown sure—touchdown pass from Tino Sun-
seri that would have put the game away.

Just four plays later, Sunseri came back to
Shanahan again, lofting the ball to him in the
back right corner of the end zone. He caught _
that one.

It was around that time when swarms of or-
ange and maroon ﬁled out of the stadium, rrluch
like Panther fans are so accustomed to doing.

And then, after the ﬁnal second ticked off
the clock and each side took to midﬁeld to
shake hands, the players danced and celebrated
in front of the students who cheered them on
all game. ' -

But one player in particular remained stoic
throughout all the hoopla.

Sunseri, standing in one of the end zones
that he and his teammates found so often on
Saturday, raised the game ball high above his

head and pointed it slightly toward the stands
in a show of appreciation.

“The student section was down there cheer-
ing the whole game. I felt like this was the loud-
est that I’ve seen Heinz Field,” Sunseri said after
completing 19-of-28 passes for 283 yards and
three touchdowns. “The fans were into it, and

I I was just saying ‘thank you.”’

Following the game, when reporters asked
how he manages to stay focused amid the inces-

, sant public scrutiny, Sunseri’s mood quickly

soured.

“I don’t know. I just go and do my job,” he
responded sharply.

Staring ﬁrmly straight ahead, Sunseri didn’t
ﬂinch when prompted again. .

“I just do my job.”

Whether the hardened starting quarterback
will continue to do his job —— and whether we’ll
see thatpost-game pose again this season — is
anybody’s guess.

But I can guarantee that the often dispar-

aged Sunseri, who constantly deals with those .

same fans he acknowledged calling for him to
be benched, has seldom felt so good.

SEPICH , ‘

Pitt redshirt junior linebacker Shane
Gordon stated that Saturday’s defensive
performance was a massive improvement
from the unit’s lackluster efforts in the ﬁrst
two contests.

“In the ﬁrst two games, we blew so many
assignments,” he said, “but we played really
good assignment football today.”.

Gordon also said he predicted that his
defensive backs would come down with some
interceptions.

“I told Holley, ‘You’re going to get an [in-
terception] today; and he got one,” he said,
“and [Hendricks] came up big with two.”

The defense ﬁnished with seven tackles
for loss, three interceptions and two forced
fumbles.

The game’s deﬁning series occurred early
in the fourth quarter when the Panthers,
up 28-17 at the time, embarked on a time-
consuming 15-play, 88-yard touchdown drive
that assured Pitt of its ﬁrst victory of the
season. . ~

135 am Ste 

|

Freshman running back Rushel Shell .

sparked the crucial drive with rushes of 13
and 29 yards as he wore down the Hokies’
defense. He ﬁnished with 159 yards on 23
carries — his ﬁrst career 100-yard game.
‘Pitt head coach Paul Chryst praised his
star freshman after the game and credited
the offensive line for playing its best game
of the young season. A
I‘ “I certainly knew he was capable of that,”
hryst said of Shell’s performance. “We love

~ lhe way he ran, and I loved the play of the
offensive linemen and the look in their eye

today.” _

This solitary win, which marks the ﬁrst
victory in Chryst’s head coaching career at
any level, doesn’t excuse the horrible blowout
losses to Youngstown State and Cincinnati.

But defeating a ranked team — something
no other Big East program has accomplished
yet this season — does prove that this Pitt
football team has the capability to challenge

_for the conference championship in 2012.

And perhaps with more performances
like Saturday’s, the Panthers will compete
for ACC titles for years to come.
