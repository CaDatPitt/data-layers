* Pitt Enters Term Without State Funds;
Operations Normal, Future Clouded    

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

Pitt, entering its 12th year as a
state-related institution, begins fall
 without its state appropria-
;i a . which was expected to finance
’)I2.L'*-i.hi1‘d of the University’s
‘I77 '/'-78 operations.

Pitt officials are hopeful the
U- ersity will receive its state

‘  s soon after the legislature’s
' Si. 26 return to session in
F .sburg, despite the fact fund-
it of state-related and -aided
limitations will require higher
ts . as opposed by many lawmakers.
Lt is not unprecedented for Pitt to
51 It a school year without its state
fr :ads—once, in fact, the University
'‘ sed a payroll—but the way in
lCh “non-preferred” appropria-
tions such as Pitt_’_s have been tied to
5t‘ max increase is unusual.
' * deadlock between the legisla-
ll,‘ tax-increase and no-tax-in-
rcase factions left Pennsylvania

 iffrd non-preferred appropriations,
 5/‘hich fund institutions not directly
:ontrolled by the state and which
guire a two-third vote for
passage, were deleted from the
spending package presented the
‘egislature. Under current tax
schedules, the state expects $5.1

state are among non-preferred
institutions. Pitt, which requested

mended the University receive $62;
million.

Pitt’s Board of Trustees passed a
budget last May that authorized
$199.7 million in University spend-
ing this fiscal year, expecting $62-
million in state funds. '

The University’s cash ﬂow,
fueled mainly by tuition payments,
will allow the University to operate
without borrowing until late Sep-
tember. At that time, Pitt, said to
have a good credit rating, will be
forced to borrow from area banks,
using such University-owned build-
ings as the Cathedral of Learning
and Pitt Stadium as collateral. The
Trustees will meet in mid-Septem-
ber a request by Pitt ofﬁcials for
borrowing authority.

University officials are confident
state money will reach Pitt "at some
time during fall term, though they
concede the tax battle, which must
be fought before Gov. Shapp will be
able to sign the non-preferred
appropriations bill, could drag into
January or later.

Chancellor Posvar has called the
chance of Pitt’s not receiving any
state funds “unthinkable,” but
added that “at some point we must
ask our legislators and the public to
think about the unthinkable, if only
to produce the action to prevent it. ”

Posvar said institutions receiving
non-preferred appropriations “are
being held hostage as a way of

making up a shortage of state

revenues,” and branded the
situation “ deplorable. ’. ’

Pitt officials also are quick to say
they do not believe any tax passed to
fund the non-preferreds should be
termed a higher-education tax.

Posvar said he has received
“assurances” from state leaders
that they will work to ensure early
action on Pitt’s appropriation and
that they wold argue for passage.

An aide to one of the legislature’s
leaders. however. said the fall ﬁght
over taxes will not be an easy one for
those lawmakers seeking to fund
the non-preferreds.

‘ ‘I just can't see where they’ll get
the votes for a tax increase,” he
said. “They gave away everything
but the Capital Dome to get votes
for the general appropriations
bill—there just isn't anything left to
give.

‘ ‘I’ve never seen anyone in as bad
a position as the non-preferreds are
in right now...IfI were Pitt, I'd be
scared,” he added.

Posvar, meanwhile, has attemp-
ted to assure Pitt’s employes and
students that the University’s
operations have not been affected
by the lack of appropriations.

“Tuition levels will remain as
they were announced in July,” he
said. “Faculty and staff salaries
will remain stable with no cutbacks
or layoffs in services at this time.”

Posvar said Penn State’s ﬁnancial
outlook was “roughly” the same as
Pitt’s, but said Temple was “in a
tighter situation” because of
deﬁcits at a Temple hospital.

Wecht "extremely unhappy"

Langley Investigation Heats

By DAN ROSENTHAL

Allegheny County Coroner Cyril
Wecht said recently that he is
“extremely unhappy” with Equit-
able Gas Compa‘ny’s conduct in the
ongoing investigation of last
January’s Langley Hall explosion.

Legalsuits asking more than $2
million are pending against Equit-
able as a result of the blast.

“Their (Equitable’s) entire ap-

proach to the investigation falls far

short of what is ethically expected
and I ﬁnd their behavior abomin-
able,” Wecht told the Pitt News.

A structurally damaged 4-inch
natural gas line owned by Equitable
and extracted near the Langley site
could be responsible for seeping gas

   
  

:3  -,

 

that was accidentally ignited
causing the explosion, Pittsburgh
Police Superintendant Robert Coll
said after a coroner’s inquest seven
months ago.

Wecht has ruled the blast
accidental saying natural gas was
the most plausible cause.

The line was sent to Metallurgical
Consultants, a testing ﬁrm in
Houston, Texas, and was later
sequestered for the coroner’s
hearings.

Following the inquest, Equitable
was cleared by Wecht of criminal
negligence because the utility had
tested the pipe as late as the month

. before the explosion.

The line was then returned to
Houston for further testing and,
according to an Equitable attorney,
is still there.

“I was told the tests would take
only a week or two at the most,”
Wecht said. “If I had known that
seven months after the inquest the
pipe would still not be available, I
would never have let it out of my
jurisdiction.

“They lied to me,” Wecht said,
“and that again shows their bad
faith in this investigation. ‘ I'm
extremely unhappy.”

Wecht’s comments came as no
surprise to Equitable Gas.

“Dr. Wecht has never -shown a

 

very close rapport with Equitable
Gas,” William Tighe, an Equitable
attorney, said. .

Tighe was subpoenaed by Wecht
during the coroner’s inquest and it
was Tighe who had the damaged
pipe sent to Texas for testing.

Soil information was needed by
the Texas firm and Pitt would not
release the needed samples until
June, according to Tighe.

“That’s one reason the testing is
still not complete and I don’t feel
Dr. Wecht can get any more
information from the pipe than he
already has,” Tighe said.

“He had the pipe during the
inquest and allowed his people to
examine it, but the pipe belongs to
Equitable,” he said. “There are
legal cases pending and you don’t
just turn evidence over to the other
side.”

Currently, four cases have been
ﬁled against Equitable. Pitt is suing
for one-half million dollars for
microscopes, books, furniture and
other property destroyed in the Jan.
20 explosion, which ‘killed two
women and injured almost 70 other
persons.

The State Department of General
Services, which built and owns
Langley Hall, is seeking $1.5
million. ~

Two students, Greg Malzone and
Paul Rudnick, are also seeking
monetary damages from Equitable
for injuries sustained in the blast.

During the coroner’s hearings,
Tighe accused Wecht of being ‘ ‘less
than objective” because Wecht is
on the Pitt faculty.

Wecht is a volunteer adjunct
professor in two School of Medicine
departments. .

It is still uncertain, according to
Tighe, if ﬁndings from the Texas
ﬁrm will be used in courts.

Nyden and
Make Cash

Former assistant sociology pro-
fessor Paul J. Nyden’s 18-month
battle with Pitt over his contract’s
non-renewal ended Aug. 30 when
the self-proclaimed Marxist and
the University agreed to an
out-of-court ﬁnancial settlement.

Neither side would reveal the
amount of the settlement. It was
reported in July that Nyden was
asking for more than $10,000 to
cover expenses and the renewal of
his contract.

  

PAUL NYDEN

Nyden ﬁled suit in federal court
after Chancellor Posvar withdrew a
15-month contract offer to the
sociologist after Nyden “accept-
ance” of the offer “under sharp
protest.”

University lawyers concluded
that Nyden’s acceptance letter,
which listed his objections to the
Chancellor's contract proposal, did

EREE

University
Settlement

not constitute a legal acceptance of
the offer.

Nyden charged Pitt with breach
of contract and sought a ruling
from federal court judge Daniel
Snyder to the effect that he had
properly accepted the contract
offer.‘

The argument over breach of
contract became moot with the
ﬁnancial settlement, which fol-
lowed two days of private negotiat-
ing sessions and public testimony.

After the settlement was an-
nounced, Nyden and University
representatives held a joint press
conference refusing to call the
settlement a victory for either side.

Nyden said he is forbidden to
discuss the settement but revealed
that the sum will enable him to
continue his research on the United
Mine Workers and the United Steel
Workers unions for‘an extended
period of time.

Nyden’s ﬁght with the University
began in March, 1976 when the
sociology department recom-
mended his contract not be
renewed. nyden took his appeal for
contract renewal through Univers-
ity channels, ending with a review
from a University Senate panel.

The Senate hearing board found
a procedural defect in Nyden’s
tenure review and recommended
he receive another three-year
appointment.

Of Tenure Decision

By BETSY NORMAN

Dr. .Sharon Johnson, a senior
research associate with Pitt’s
medical school embroiled in a
six-year sex discrimination ﬁght
with the University, has decided not
to appeal U.S. District Court Judge
William Knox’s decision in favor of
Pitt.

Johnson, who was suing for
tenure and $1.5 million, will be
allowed to stay at Pitt until June 30,
1978. ,

It has been speculated the
University pressured Johnson’s
decision not to appeal. Johnson
refused to verify the charge.

Pitt’s Director of Legal Services
William Hannon said, “The Uni-
versity has not pressured anyone.”

Knox’s 92-page decision, handed
down on August 3, cleared Pitt and
its administration of all charges of
sex discrimination.

Knox conceded Johnson made
out a prima -facie case of sex
discrimination, but said Pitt “arti-
culated legitimate and non-discrim-
inatory reasons for the action taken
(Johnson)
promotion and tenure...These rea-
sons are ineffectiveness of her
teaching and lack of relevancy of her
research to the mission of (her)
department.”

The decision in the case,
according to Knox, was based on a
ﬁnding of fact. /

STATE BOARD HOLDS
HEARINGS AT LAW SCHOOL

The Pennsylvania State Board of
I Pardons will hold hearings at Pitt
Law School tomorrow.

~ The f1ve—member board hears

The Pitt hearings mark the first
time the board has met. at a law
school. The Board of Pardons
meets in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg
and Philadelphia. The Pittsburgh
hearings are held six times a year
usually in the Supreme Court
Room at the City-County Building.

Board members include Lieu-
tenant Governor Ernest Kline,
Robert Kane, Pa. Attorney
General, Dr. Albert Biele, psy-
chiatrist, Richard Rogers, Attor-
ney, and Laurel Rans, penologist.

The hearing at Pitt is open to the

Various women’s groups in
Pittsburgh were upset and disap-
pointed with the decision of Judge
Knox.

First Pittsburgh Chapter of the
National Organization for Women
(NOW) Co-president Flo Scardina
said, “It is this kind of decision we
unfortunately have come to expect
from the U.S. judicial system
today. We wish it were not so, but
this ruling follows Supreme Court
decisions prohibiting abortions for
poor women and disability compen-
sation for pregnant women. These
decisions show women in this
country are not receiving justice,
particularly in the federal courts.”

It has been reported that NOW, in
addition to the National Education
Association, the American Chemi-
cal Society and other professional
and women’s groups have paid
some of Johnson’s legal costs,
which have been estimated at
$65,000.

According to Chancellor Posvar,
Pitt spent $300,000 ﬁghting the
charges.

Hannon, director of legal services
for Pitt, said.

“The extracted line was not in
use but it still had gas in it,” he
added.‘

The only natural gas lines serving
Langley Hall are on the Ruskin
Street side and feed only laboratory
desks for Bunsen burners, accord-
ing to Alex Kaminsky, Pitt’s

director of plant services and .‘,_¢_

“Those lines held up under test
pressure of 100 pounds where
normally, there are only six ounces
of pressure,” Kaminsky said.

Equitable’s damaged line was
pulled from the sidewalk on the
Tennyson Avenue side of Langley
and contained gas, though it served
no customers, he said.

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism_at the University of Pittsburgh"

Was lst Das?

More than a few University officials have long found the summer
months an excellent time to announce unpopular decisions; tuition

' increases are the most easily remembered example.

This summer, however, a new body made use of the students’
absence in a most unfortunate way. During its July meeting, the
faculty-dorninated Senate Council rejected a student-sponsored
resolution that sought to ‘reduce Pitt’s ability to hire persons who

- are not “comprehensible to...students in normal conversational.

English” as classroom instructors.

The resolution received only /five affirmative votes—from five
student members of Council. It sought to make deans responsible for
ensuring that future faculty appointments be made only after it had
been established that the applicant possessed an adequate command of
the language in which he would teach.

That does not sound like an unreasonable demand of a would-be
professor. But Council somehow found the idea unacceptable. One
member, in fact, said a teacher’s language handicap might be
overlooked in some instances. “In cases where the applicant brings
sufﬁcient scholarship to the position,” he said, “we might let the
teaching part go...”

What Senate Council apparently failed to understand is that letting
“the teaching part go” is what is unacceptable. What good is a
teacher, no matter how knowledgeable, if he cannot impart his

_ wisdom because of a language handicap?

One professor used Albert Eintein as an example of why the
resolution should not have been passed. It would be a crime, he said,
if Albert Einstein could not teach at Pitt simply because students could
not understand him. A greater crime would be the unleashing of any
incompetent professor——and inability to communicate is a form of
incompetence——on a group of students. The crime is made worse
when the University sanctions, by inaction, the presence of that
instructor.

Provost Rhoten Smith, the man second to Chancellor Posvar in
Pitt’s academic chain of command, wasn’t sure the problem was so
prevalent as to merit action. He asked a student sponsor if the
problem was “all that serious.” This reﬂects an appalling lack of
knowledge concerning the issue, one that may have been corrected
when General Studies Dean Steele Gow testified to the problem’s
severity. '

Nearly every student, especially those of sciences, has at least one
horror story concerning a class taught by a professor whose
vocabulary rivaled that of R2-D2. The Pitt News will give students a
chance to make their experiences known next week when it publishes a
form on which students can list the frequency of their past problems,
the departments involved and the‘ names of the offending instructors.

Thus armed, student representatives will have a much better chance
to get Senate Council to‘ change its vote. Especially since that vote will
come at a time when students, sick of leaving an Algerian-speaking
professor only to find a Chinese-speaking teaching assistant, will be on
campus and able to be heard.

Letters to the Editor

Fighting Pitt’s “Repulsive” Practices

We are constantly told that the
college student of today is totally
self-centered and completely apa-
thetic about social justice. The
media would have us’ believe that
students have crawled into a
political cocoon and care only about
the next wild party and job at the
end of school. Many of us
recognize our historic and moral
duty as students to join in as part of
the community in the struggle
against unjustice. Many of us
come from working class families
with a strong labor tradition and
will not discard that fact when we
enter the college scene. We are
proud of our families and their
struggles, and will join hands-with
them and other citizens who are
ﬁghting Pitt’s anti-unionism, and
the blatant discrimination against

blacks, women, and any teacher
whose world view differs from that
of Chancellor Posvar and the
corporate Board of Trustees.
Western Pennsylvania Citizens
for Justice at Pitt is a group of
taxpayers, trade unionists, clergy-
persons and students who are
ﬁghting back against Pitt’s re-
pulsive practices. We are enraged
that Pittsburgh’s largest employer,
Pitt, is also Pittsburgh’s largest
and most vicious anti-union em-
ployer. We are concerned that
teachers such as Dr. Paul Nyden,
who fought discrimination at Pitt
and took his stand with labor in
writing, who in practice are ﬁred or
hounded out of the University We
are concerned that only 600 of over

8000 undergrads are black. Other.

black enrollment ﬁgures: only 4%

The Pitt News asked four persons, two from
Pitt and two from the Legislature, to comment
on any aspect of this year’s unusual budget
situation that pairs Pitt’s appropriation and a

tax incrase.

Their columns appear on the Op/ Ed page.

Student Government Welcomes
Freshman Class of 1980

We, the Student Government
Board, would like to take this
opportunity to welcome all return-
ing students back to Pitt and say a
very special hello to all ﬁrst year and
transferring students. We are all
proud of the University of
Pittsburgh and have much to look
forward to during the coming
academic year. The Board has been
hard at work on a number of projects
that we think will help to make all
phases of your time here at Pitt
more fulﬁlling and enjoyable.

This year at Pitt, you will ﬁnd
some new experiences as well as
many old reliables. True, gone is
one Mr. Dorsett and his extraordin-
ary style of play on the gridiron, as
well as key members of our national
championship football team. Gone
also, for a number of various
reasons, are some familiar faces
from the faculty, staff and
administration. However, many of
the people, programs and tradition-

.al artifacts that help to make Pitt

what it is have returned to continue
to serve students as they have in the
past.

Also this year, you will ﬁnd the
full opening of the Forbes Complex,
as well as a new and challenging
Honors Program that will help to
insure Pitt of the continued
academic excellence it has so richly
earned and its students deserve.

Programs and openings such as
these are just a few of the many
features you can look forward to in
the coming year.
Again, we say welcome and wish
one and all a good academic and
social year here at Pitt. We think
life at the University has a great
deal to offer to all phases of your
learning and growing experience. It
is our sincere hope that you will
avail yourself to these services and
take advantage of them; and us,
your Student Government Board.
We are all here to serve and work for
you. It is a pleasure, privilege and
responsibility that we take serious-
ly. Watch us, talk to us, help us: we
are only as strong as those we serve.

Students,   Livestock and the Legislature

By Thomas F. Lamb

The current budget situation in
Harrisburg and its effect on the
state-related universities as well as
other non-public beneﬁciaries of
state funding because they are en-
titled “non-preferred” suggests
that perhaps this is the time to
examine the status of “non-
preferred” appropriations and to
determine whether or not they

 deserve this designation.

« programs:

B»

ﬁat

 

To those who are not familiar -

with the history of the term
“non-preferred,” it would seem
to indicate that institutions which
receive appropriations on the

basis of their “non-preferred”'

status are of low priority in terms

of receiving state funding. An
examination of the General Fund
Budget shows that an ap-
propriation for the support of the
“Great Lakes Commission” and
the staging of a dairy show and
open livestock show are con-
sidered “preferred” ap-
propriations whereas the funding

‘of the state-related universities or
funding to the City of Harrisburg
for protecting the Capitol com-
plex from destruction by fire are
considered ‘ ‘non-preferred. ’ ’

The distinction in these terms
derives from the Pennsylvania
Constitution, which states that
,“No appropriation shall be made
to any charitable or educational
institution not under the absolute

control of the Commonwealth. .
.except by a vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to each
House.” It is the Bureau of the
Budget that has defined “non-

preferred” appropriations to be .

those requiring a two-thirds
majority for passage. -
In 1966, when Pitt officially
became state-related, the Univer-
sity was specifically designated as

an integral part of the Common-

wealth System of Higher
The Act of the

Education.
General Assembly declared:

“That the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania
recognizes University of
Pittsburgh as an integral
part of a system of_ higher
education in Pennsylvania,
and that it is desirable and in

the public interest‘ to per-

petuate and extend the
relationship between the
Commonwealth of Pen-

nsylvania and University of
Pittsburgh for the purpose
of improving and
strengthening higher
education by designating
University of Pittsburgh as a
State-related university.

Education Without-New Taxes

By Robert J. Butera

It is not true that
Pennsylvania must have a
permanent tax increase to fund
Pitt, Penn State, Temple and
other state-related universities
and institutions. -
The tax increase that is bein
requested is to be used to
replace the university money
which was stolen a few weeks
ago to balance an inflated
general government operations
budget. ’

So the politicians took the
university money and used it to
pay for the increases they
wanted in government
spending. Now they are

claiming that $300 million in~

new taxes is necessary to keep
the schools open.

A few weeks ago -we
witnessed the holding hostage
of welfare recipients and state
employes until the
Administration was able to

 Education   As

Rhetorical Cause

By K. Leroy Irvis

Many people across the
commonwealth are understan-
dably concerned about the non-
preferreds, and the fact that no
state monies have yet been ap-
propriated for them. I have
been asked for my views of this
problem and my expectations as
to how it will be resolved.

Each year, efforts are made
by some member of the
legislature to eliminate state
f; . s for one or more of these
it’. itutions. Arguments will be
made that they are failing to do
an adequate job and hence
should be cut “back or.
eliminated. I am familiar with
these arguments, but I have

 

- never believed that we spend too

much (or even enough) on
higher education. We may need
to do a careful review of Pen-
nsylvania’s educational
whether they truly
meet students needs, both
academically and vocationally;
 whether specific. programs
1.’: duplicated unnecessarily in
geographical areas. But any
such weaknesses should not be
used as reason to lessen our
commitment to educational op-
portunities for every person in
this state.

Education is a favorite
rhetorical cause, but good
education costs money; and I
will support full funding for
non-preferred institutions as
well as the taxes to pay for
them. I will urge my colleagues

to join me in this fight to keep

<yt“:her education alive and

is V; . owing in Pennsylvania.

The recent budget crisis was
created, in part, by the strong
feelings of many members of

the House and Senate that state
government should find ways to
cut back and economize. I cer-
tainly cannot disagree,
however, that cutbacks should be
achieved with planning, not by
suddenly furloughing thousands
of state workers. In passing the
Federal Augmentation Bill
(which matches federal grant
monies with state monies) the

   

 

House inserted a very important
amendment. This amendment
requires each department to,
submit a plan by February 1,
1978 by which it will decrease

" spending five percent in the next

fiscal year. This bill has been
signed into law and we can now
anticipate cutbacks made in a
planned, responsible manner.
If changes are needed in our-
higher education system, they
should be made similarly; with
planning and a view to the needs
of students.

In the coming weeks I will be
doing my best to insure the
future of the non-preferred in-
stitutions.

Representatives.

work its political will on a bare
majority of legislators. Those
citizens of Pennsylvania were
denied benefits and paychecks
so that their anger and
frustrations would pressure
legilators into voting for a
government operations budget
in which most legislators did not
believle.

The pressures of those
groups. . .and the back room
political deals. .eventually
forced the 102 votes required
for passage in the State House.

Contrary to our demands.
.the universities and other state-
related institutions were left out
of the budget and all the state
money was spent.

Now comes the intimidation.

.the coercion.
universities and the students.
Now there are new hostages and
anew ransom.

The hostages are on the
univerity. campuses. The
ransom demand of ’the Shapp
Administration ‘ are legislative
votes for substantial new taxes

V in Pennsylvania.

Thomas Jefferson warned
against the evil of “political
coercion” in our institutions of
higher learning. Now, in l977,we
are witnesses to the most blatant
effort ever to coerce students,
alumni, parents of student,
instructors, professors and
administrators into advocating

-a substantial tax increase in

Pennsylvania.

Certain politicians will
attempt to make you believe
that the requested new taxes are
for higher education. You are
supposed to carry the bannre
for new_taxes for the cause of
education. In reality, you are
being asked to support new
taxes to replace the money the
politicians stole from the
universities for the government
they run.

There is another way out of
this mess. There is a way to
fund the universities with the
money that was always intended
for their use. There is a way to
avoid enactment of permanent
new taxes in Pennsylvania.

Everyone already

acknowledges the fact that the .

biggest part of the_ money
crunch in Pennsylvania is the

I fact that state government

wound up last with arevenue
deficit of $156 million. The
Governor overestimated the
amount of taxes that would be
coming in last year and spent as
though it was being received.
Now state government has to
fill last year’s “one time”
revenue deficit with taxes
collected this year. That money
is supposed to pay for this
year’s needs.

If that fact did not exist, there
would be $156 million more in
revenue for spending this year.

Everyone also admits
(including the Governor) that
there will be an additional $420
million in taxes paid this year
even if we keep the same tax
rates. That is because as
personal income goes up so does
the amount of money we pay in
income tax to the state
government. As the cost of
merchandise goes up so does the
amount of monev we pay to the

.of the-

state in sales tax.

more in taxes.

I believe that this natural
inflationary growth in tax
revenues should be sufficient to
pay for the increased costs of

state government.

to cut-back the increases in state

and Senator Cianfrani and still

properly fund the universities.

I ask that everyone give

alternatives to succumbing to
the political coercion of this
Administration and certain
legislative leaders. ,

For the present, I have every

reason to believe that the General

Assembly, acting on a bipartisan
basis, will recognize
educational, reseatch and public
service rolls of these state-related
institutions and will provide the
funds necessary for their con-
tinued support and operation.
For the future, however, the issue
of whether Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln should be
treated as “preferred” or “non-
preferred” might be considered.
by the Legislature in the form of
,a Constitutional amendment.

however, not whether the ap-

wealth’s constituents. '

  Sort Of

- By Wesley W. Posvar

As I have said repeatedly, the
passage of a general state ap-
propriation without any
provision for the state-related
and state-aided institutions in a
cause for grave concern. Yet it
createsa political situation which
is least likely to become quickly
resolved in an atmosphere of
anxiety and recrimination.

0

To those who may not be fully
aware, it must be made clear that
fqr Pitt, Penn State, Temple,
Lincoln,all the medical schools in
. Pennsylvania and indirectly many

private colleges, hospitals and
cultural institutions, the ultimate

issue is survival.

Would the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania allow its superb
system of higher education to
fall? Just as nuclear war is un-
thinkable, such an outcome for
Pennsylvania education is un-
thinkable. Yet, at some point we
must ask our legislators and the
public to think about the un-
thinkable, if only to produce the
action to prevent it.

It should be understood that
we and all these other institutions
are being held hostage as a way of
making up a shortage of state
revenues. This is a deplorable
situation and I fought hard
against it.

I ask you all to remember and
to emphasize to all your family
and friends that whatever tax is

passed is not a higher education L

tax but one that has already been
mandated to meet a general fund
shortage in the total state budget.

At this time, we have no choice.
but to place reliance in the state

I governmental leadership. I have

been given firm assurances in
meetings with them that they
fully favor and intend to do
everything in their power to effect
early passage of appropriations
and complete funding for the
state-related and state-aided in-
stitutions.

. In the meanwhile, our cash
flow will carry us for a few weeks
until the legislature has time to“
act. So, as we begin this fall
term, I call upon the entire
University community, students,‘
and faculty and staff to go about
the business of education, public
service and research in a normal
way. Tuition levels will remain
as they were announced in July;
faculty and staff salaries will

remain stable with no layoffs or
cutbacks in services at this time.

o
On my part, my unrelenting
task in the coming weeks will be
to keep the political leaders and
the legislators continually aware
of what is truly at stake for us,
for them. and for the whole
Commonwealth.

cellor of the University of Pitts-

Bayard Street Brews

During Hot Summer

The eye of a hurricane passed
over Bayard St. fraternities this
summer; one that brought false
calm to the conﬂict between Greeks

their neighbors. However, this
xx merely the lull before the storm
as neighbors geared up for a court
ﬁght against fraternities they hope
to initiate in the months to come.

According to a Bayard St.
resident, a neighborhood associa-
tion has hired a Pittsburgh law firm
to represent them against the
fraternity system. It is in the
process of gathering evidence now.
The resident could not estimate
when the case would reach court.

The neighborhood association
complaints against its Greek

 I5_g_..’,.~_‘ghbors include abusive language

.; 

u

and public indecency. It cites
instances of disorderly conduct,
public urination and sunbathing,
harassment and drunkenness. The
association, reportedly, is collecting
$200 from each resident interested
in participating in the pending
litigation.

Delta Tau Delta has informally
contacted William Kunstler, an
alumni of one of their chapters and
defender in several heavily publici-
zed trials of the past decade. A
reliable source close to the situation

Said that Kunstler had been

I: .onsulted but it had not been

determined whether he would
represent the individual chapter, or
the entire IFC, should he enter the
case.

In the meantime IFC is preparing
a code of conduct to be ratiﬁed by
Pitt’s ‘Greek’ chapters that would
define a workable system of
behavior limits and redress proce-
dures to please both sides in the
dispute. —

Grad Employe Pay
Hiked 7.5 Percent

By BETSY NORMAN

A seven and one-half percent
salary increase increase for grad-
uate employes, recommended by
Vice Chancellor for Planning and
Budget Jack Freeman, took effect
September 1, according to the
Provost’s office.

The across-the board hikes boost
teaching assistants’ earnings to
$3,578 for two terms and teaching
fellows’ salaries to $3,818 for two
terms.

While University officials claim
the move was basically an effort to
keep Pitt’s salaries comparable to
those of other universities, the
Union of Graduate Employes (UGE)
feels the increases were a result of
recent complaints on the part of
graduate employes.

“These salary increases are, in
the eyes of the UGE, deﬁnitely
linked to recent moves on the part of
graduate employes toward unioni-
zation and to the pro-union vote in
last spring’s FAS-GSO sponsored
mock collective bargaining elec-

tion,” UGE spokesperson Ronaele
Novotny said.

‘ ‘It is our view that the increases,
while nice, are not really sufficient
for the amount of work done by T As
and TFs. Since the average
graduate employe does one-half the
work of a full time instructor, it is
UGE’s view that graduate employes
should receive one-half the salary of
a full-time instructor, which would
equal approximately $6,000 for two
terms.”

Bob Dunkelman, assistant to the
provost, said among nine member-
colleges comparable to Pitt in the
American Association of Universi-
ties (AAU), Pitt would rank between
sixth and seventh in terms of TA
and TF salaries.

Graduate and Professional Stu-
dent Association co-chairman Wil-
liam Voharas said he was pleased
with the increase.

“We have consistently called for
increases of graduate employe
benefits and we're glad to see an
increase in these money-tight
times.”

Summer of Losers: Nyden, Johnson and Budget

As Pitt students indulged in the
pleasures of summer, news con-
tinued to be made on campus. For
those out of touch with University
events, the following is a recap of
the past summer’s highlights:

APRIL 26, 1977

The Paul Nyden case received its
ﬁfth University evaluation as the
self-proclaimed Marxist sociology
professor fought to retain his
teaching position. This was
Nyden’s ﬁnal appeal...Caryl M.
Kline, Pitt’s director of Continuing
Education for Women was con-
firmed as Pennsylvania’s Secretary
of Education. .The post pays
$44,000 .annually...A"~. burning
broom on the ninth floor of Tower A
set off a fire alarm resulting in
evacuation of the building.

MAY 3, 1977

A University Senate Council
hearing board voted unanimously
for the reinstatement of Paul
Nyden following an intensive
two-week study into the evaluation
procedure which terminated his
contract with Pitt. Citing the
sociology department's improper
and uncustomary review proced-
ures which failed to clearly outline
for Nyden the criteria by which his
contract would be judged, the
six-member faculty panel recom-
mended to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar that Nyden’s three-year
contract be renewed...A 25 percent

 

increase in female enrollment and
corresponding 20 percent rise in
degrees granted to women occur-
red at Pitt between 1970 and 1975.
The report, issued by Anne Parke,
university reports and surveys
coordinator, also showed male
enrollment down by seven percent
but the number of degrees granted
to men increased by eight percent.

MAY 5, 1977

The University administration
met with senior sociology faculty
members to hear their concerns
about the possible re-instatement
of fired assistant professor Paul
Nyden. The 31-year old Marxist
professor had allegedly alienated
many of his colleagues with.what
the University Senate Council
found to be “inﬂamatory state-
ments and publications directed
against the department.” Some of
those statements and publications
appeared in the form of letters to
the editor of the Pitt News... Both
sides in the Sharon Johnson sex
discrimination case against Pitt
summarized their testimony in the
courtroom of Judge William Knox.
Johnson, a Pitt bio-chemistry
professor, was denied tenure in
1971. She retained her University
position when Judge Knox handed
down an injunction, called by some
a “landmark decision,” which
allowed Johnson to keep her job at
Pitt until the suit is resolved.

MAY 10, 1977

The chancellor's office pledged
University support for the nation-
wide boycott of the J.P. Stevens

Company. The Southern-based
corporation, the second largest
U.S. textile manufacturer, has

been found guilty of violating
various labor laws, including the
National Labor Relations Act, the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Act and the Occupational Health
and Safety Act. Stevens has also
been charged with racial and
sexual discrimination and with
violating federal regulations on
noise and dust levels...A federal
regulation calling for insured rights
for handicapped students across
the country will affect Pitt to the
tune of $50,000 a year. The ruling,
which applies to Pitt as a recipient
of federal assistance from the
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, became law June 1.

MAY 12, 1977

Renovations for undergraduate
housing in Bruce Hall will begin
after the completion of the Forbes
Professional Quadrangle, Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar announced.
Interior furnishings of the quadran-
gle buildings should be complete
by Jan. 1, 1978, Director of
Facilities Planning "Hunt Martin
said. The offices currently in Bruce
Hall, including the Graduate
School of Public and International
affairs, will be located in the

Quadrangle, vacating all but the
second, third and 12th ﬂoors for the
dormitory...Political science pro-
fessor John Chapman denounced
the unanimous vote of the
University Senate Council hearing
board for the re-appointment of
Paul Nyden claiming the board’s
misunderstanding of the criteria by
which academic appointment is
reviewed invalidates their re-
commended action to the Chancel-
lor to re-hire the assistant
professor...A $10,000 check to fund
School of General Studies (SGS)
scholarships was presented to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar by SGS
Student Cabinet members. The
new scholarship program for night
students is the first at Pitt and
among the few in the country. The
funds were accumulated from
unspent activities fees.

MAY 17,1977

Pitt’s senior staff appeared ready
to recommend a budget which
included a $100 to $150 increase in
two-term undergraduate tuition,
the Pitt News learned. A $100
increase in two-term tuition would
make students’ per term bill $655.
Pitt undergraduates paid $1,210 for
two terms’ education this fall and
winter, an increase of six percent
over the 1975-76 bill... Chancellor
Wesley Posvar offered Paul Nyden
a 15-month reinstatement as an
assistant sociology professor di-
rectly responsible to the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome

Rosenberg. The offer, retroactive

removed Nyden from close contact
with his department by specifying

ments from Rosenberg, who would
also be his chief evaluator. Nyden
told the Pitt News that he would
sign the Chancellor's proposal
under protest.

MAY 19, 1977

University Trustees approved a
$199.7 million 1977-78 operating
budget that includes a third

consecutive tuition increase. Most p

full-time undergraduates will pay
an additional $50 per term,
beginning this fall...Tuition in the
medical school rose by $1,000 for
the second straight year, making
in-state tuition $4,000 and out-of-
state tuition $6,000. Dental stu-

. dents also faced a big increase:

in-state tuition rose $600 to $3,100
yearly and out-of-state rates rose
$1,000 to $5,500. The rise in
Medical School tuition prompted
one student to comment, “The
whole problem here is a matter of
misshapen priorities, and the
powerless ones, the students, are
the ones who suffer.”

NO GUARDS, N0 PRISONERS

PITTSBURGH (AP)—An in-
sufficient number of guards at the
Allegheny County Jail has been
cited as a major reason why 17
prisoners were able to escape from
that facility last month.

While a 32-page report by Sheriff
Eugene Coon said no single
circumstance was wholly to blame
for either the escape Aug. 6 or a riot
the next day, it cited inadequate
guard staff as a contributing factor
18 times.

The report also claims the jail
administration tolerated inmates
roaming cellblock corridors at
nights; prisoners containers; and
chronic troublemakers being given
jobs to appease them.

In his investigation of events

‘leading up to the escape, Coon said

a woman visitor, reportedly the wife
of inmate Rodney Jackson, one of
five prisoners still at large,
smuggled in a .32 caliber revolver
and wire.

Coon also said one guard who
should have been working the 4

escape was suspended because he

GORDON LIDDY RETURNS
HOME WITH WATERGATE
SECRETS INTACT

DANBURY, Conn. (AP)——
After S2‘/2 months in prison, G.
Gordon Liddy is going home
Wednesday, still holding secrets of
the Watergate burglary that he
masterminded. Because of his
silence, he has served more time
than anyone convicted in Watergate
or Watergate-related cases.

Liddy’s attorney, Peter Maroulis,
who visited him last week, said,
“Gordon hasn’t said word one
about Watergate.” Maroulis
described Liddy, 46, as “looking
ﬁne, healthy and relaxed.”

There is one more piece of
business for Liddy before he walks
through the medium-security
prison, 'with its walls and guard
towers, to freedom and his ﬁve
teen-age children.

He must appear in Williamsport,
Pa., on Tuesday afternoon to take a

CHINA LEADER WARNS
AGAINST DOGMATISM

TOKYP (AP)——-A member of
China’s ruling Politburo, in one of
the most overt signals of a new
‘ ‘pragmatic’ ’ course for Peking, has
called on the Chinese people not to
dogmatically follow political theor-
ies, it was reported Monday.

The ofﬁcial Chinese news agency
Hsinhua quoted Nieh J ung-chen as
saying the late Communist party
Chairman Mao Tse-tung “consis-
tently stood against taking Marx-
ism-Leninist theory ‘the peak’ and
‘absolute authority.’ ”

Nieh’s comments, made in an
article in the party journal Red Flag,
were reported as a 15-member
Chinese trade mission left Peking
for a visit to the United States. The
Wang
Yao-ting, chairman of the China
Council for the Promotion of
International Trade.

Publication of the article and the
trade delegation’s mission comes
amid moves by the new Chinese
leadership to improve the economy
and turning China into a modern
power by the end of the century.

By RON SIEGEL

The Pitt Panthers are becoming
the Rodney Dangerﬁelds of college
football. Though‘ they are
defending national champions and
holders of the longest winning
streak among major colleges (13
games), the Cats have not been
treated very kindly by the
pre-season prognosticators.

United Press International says
Jackie Sherrill’s crew is the 11th
best team in the country. The
Associated Press says ninth. Sports
Illustrated, which featured Pitt on
its cover twice last year (chalk one

'up in the loss column for Sports

Illustrated jinx fans), pegs the

Panthers for 13th.

As if to add insult to injury, or to
create one of the most important
opening games ever, many pollsters
put Notre Dame at the top of the
heap. The Fighting Irish, the heir
apparent, meet the defending
champion Panthers at Pitt Stadium
Saturday (3:50 p.m.), andthe nation

‘will be watching.

The people least rankled by the
low rankings are the Pitt players.

“We were barely in the top 10 last
year at this time, ’ ’ said quarterback

Matt Cavanaugh, who has a shot at .
following Tony Dorsett’s path to the ’

New York Touchdown Club for the
Heisman Trophy.

“To me, rankings don’t mean
anything right now,” said free
safety Bob Jury, a third-team
All-America last year. “Everybody

 

has to prove themselves. I don’t see
anybody being number one right
now.”

As long as rankings are present,
though, you might as well put them
to some use. That’s how strong
safety Jeff Delaney feels. “Notre
Dame’s being ranked number one
might help us get up for the game
more,” he said. “They’re ahead of
us.”

Playing teams ranked ahead of
yours when you're number one just
doesn’t happen, so that incentive
will be a new one for the Panthers
(and one that won’t happen again
this year if they win Saturday).

Of course, rankings are often
popularity contests (why do you
think Notre Dame is ranked number
one despite having lost several key
players who were dismissed for
various off-ﬁeld activities?).

Analyzing the balloters’ minds,
center Tom Brzoza foresees a rapid
climb in the polls if the Panthers
win, rather than the step-by-step
advancements of 1976.

“Notre Dame deserves their
ranking if they hold it,” said the
second-team All-America. “But if

The Irish are eager to beat Pitt for
two reasons. Pitt humiliated Notre

and 31-10. Arid when the Subway

Pitt '5 Pair of Kicking Shoes

ByJlMPANE

Finding a replacement for one of
the finest collegiate placekickers of
all time is no easy task, but Pitt
coach Jackie Sherill has to do just
that, and soon.

Anyone familiar with Pitt football
over the last four years would agree
that no one man could easily follow
in the footsteps of NCAA record-
breaker Carson Long. Maybe no
one man could, but how about two?

That possibility is exactly what
Sherrill seems to have in mind for
the upcoming season, at least
initially. Placekickers Dave Trout
and Mark Schubert have been vying
for superiority throughout training

camp but Sherrill was unable to
chose between them as close as 10
days before Saturday’s season
opener against Notre Dame.

Sherrill, therefore, has suggested
that he may split the duties between
two kickers while he bides his time,
waiting to see which progresses
faster.

As it looks now, though,

If Tim Grgurich’s Pitt basketball team is to rebound

Schubert, a member of Springdale’ s
WPIAL championship football
team, is expected to handle the
extra points and short ﬁeld goals
while Trout does the long-range
kicking. Sherrill," however, was
unable to speculate on whether he
would continue this platoon system
throughout the season.

“Schubert is much improved,”
he said, “but Trout provides some
good competition for him. We’ll
just have to wait and see what
happensf’

Schubert, who has three years of
eligibility left after taking a red shirt
last season, has watched from the
Pitt sideline for two years and was
the heir apparent to I.ong’s job
before Trout brought a leg stronger
than Long’s to camp.

Trout, a 5-8, 160-pound fresh-
man from Southmoreland High
School, has been impressive with
his soccer-style kicks thus far-
once booting a 57-yard field goal
following a scrimmage—so if
sharing the kicking duties with the
sidewinder is what it takes fog the

Panthers to be successful, Schubert
is all for it.

"I won’t be at all disappointed if
we split the duties,” the 6-0,
200-pounder said. ‘ ‘All I care about
is winning.”

The rivalry between the kickers is
limited to friendly competition on
the practice ﬁeld, according to
Trout, who said it would be “ great’ ’
if the kicking chores were divided.
Both kickers maintain that thereare
no hardships between them.

“We’re really good friends,”
Trout said. ‘ ‘The closest we come to
a rivalry is when one of us kicks a
ﬁeld goal, we'll move back and

challenge the other guy to kick a '

longer one.”

“There’s no rivalry at all,”
Schubert agreed. “In fact, we help
each other as much as possible. Of
course, how much can kickers with
two different styles help each
other?”

Schubert’s style, a straight-on
kick similar to Long’s approach,
provides him with a higher ball as
compared to Trout’s lower, longer

boot. Both kickers agree that Trout

is more consistent from long range
and Schubert holds the edge closer
in.

Although Schubert’s approach,
along with the fact that he will be

wearing number ﬁve on his jersey,
is reminiscent of Long, Schubert
insists that that is where the
resemblance ends.

“I’m not Carson and I’m not
going to go around trying to be like
him,” he said. “Carson and I were
close friends but I’m not going to try
to imitate him because I can’t.

‘ ‘I simply have to go out there and
think of nothing else but kicking,”
the sophomore continued. “I have
to forget about the pressure of a
situation and just kick.”

Thinking about it or not, the
pressure will be there for both
Schubert and Trout on Saturday
whenANotre Dame comes to town
and a national audience looks on to
see if Jackie Sherrill’s theory of
using four feet to ﬁll Carson Long’s
shoes will pay off.

against Notre Dame, more yards
than many players gain in a career.
His ﬁrst, ninth, and 12th best
performance (303,209,181) were
against the Irish. Notre Dame will
need no extra incentive Saturday.

“They'll be out to wipe us out,”
said comerback J .C. Wilson.

Michael Rice, a 6-8 center—forward who led the
Panthers in rebounding and was Pitt’s third-leading
scorer as a freshman last winter, is academically
ineligible to compete until January and probably will sit
out the entire 1977-78 season, the Pitt News has
learned.

In addition, coach Grgurich has lost two members of
his squad to other schools,

Point guard David Washington, who had Pitt’s
third-highest assist total last season after cming from
Gulf Coast Junior College, has enrolled at the
University of Alaska.

Center Kelvin Smith, 6-11, of Schenley High School
also has left Pitt, reportedly for Furman University.

Neither Washington nor Smith figured substantially
in Pitt’s plans for this season, but the loss of Rice will
have several adverse affects on the team.

Most obvious is the loss of Rice from the lineup. A
rugged rebounder with a good shot, Rice was, at times,
the only Panther who seemed even remotely interested
in rebounding last year. A season of battling bigger and

more numerous opponents underneath forced Rice to»

miss Pitt’s last few games with a leg injury.

Rice’s absence will alter the role of every Panther
starter next season. Freshman Sam Clancy may,
find himself unfortunate heir to Rice’s spot as the

 

team’s‘ only full-time rebounder. In any case, Clancy
will be Pitt’s only strong man inside.

Larry Harris, Pitt’s 6-6 shooter, had planned a
switch to at least part-time guard next season, but
Rice’s academic difficulties have apparently dimmed
that move’s attractiveness. “I guess he’ll have to play
forward now,” said a teammate, “there’s _rl0b0dY
else.”

Prior to discovery of Rice’s ineligibility, Pitt
probably would have fielded a lineup of Ed
Schueurmann, Clancy and Rice up front, with harris
and a point guard in the backcourt.

Sonny Lewis may not have started under those
conditions.

But rice’s problem almost assures Lewis a starting
role at the guard position Harris vacates. The front line
with Lewis at guard would be Clancy, Harris and
Scheuermann.

basketball, will bring an improved attitude to
accompany his staggering ability this season. In fact,
Lewis is said to have lectured at a camp this smmer on
the necessity of having a good attitude. .

Lewis was a high school teammate of Smith, who sat
out his freshman season because of a too-low grade
average and continued to have academic problems.
Smith’s Pitt career was hampered by injulies, poor
shooting and uneven attitude.

Washington, a quick guard, also suffered because of
his shooting and attitude.

Rice’s academic problems began last fall term, when
"he fell behind in credits. He didn’t correct his

transcri t’s deficiencies during winter term and when -
P

summer grades were reported, Rice was found to be
ineligible until January.

NCAA rules allow an academically ineligible player
to request an additional year of eligibility provided the
player does not participate at all during the season. A
teammate said Rice would exercise that option.

Grgurich, an amiable man off-court but ﬁercely
single-minded when worrying about Pitt basketball, is
said by a player to be taking this latest setback almost
complacently.

“He doesn’t seem to be worrying about it as much as
I thought he would,” he said. “I guess he figures
there’s nothing to be done now, so time’s better spent
on things other than getting upset.”

must have seemed strange in
comparison to the joyous, raucous
celebration held down the hall
following Pitt’s victory over Penn
State last November. Then things
were considerably brighter in
Pelusi’s football career. Pitt, on its
way to its first national champion-
ship in years, had just beaten Penn
State as Pelusi, playing probably his
finest game as a starting center for
the Panthers, earned national
acclaim as Lineman of the Week by
Sports Illustrated.

Things, however, have a way of
dying down, even in football. And
so it was, nine months later, things

that were so important then to

Pelusi became blurred into a
singular effort of making the
Steelers’ squad. _
Pelusi’s effort, however, proved
to be nothing more than a blur.
There were no noteworthy accom-
plishments on his part as there had
been following last season’s
Pitt-Penn State game. Neither were
there any sensational comments
from Steeler Head Coach Chuck
Noll and offensive line coach Dan
Radakovich, both of whom implied
that it would take a “super, super
effort” on Pelusi’s behalf to crack
the Steelers’ solid offensive line.

There was no reason for such

was, he fell far short of that ‘ ‘super,

by Noll and Radakovich and was

Women's Sports Off to

By MARIA SCIULLOI

Now that many athletic departments have built
up their women’s programs to the point where
recruiting and scholarship offers are common-
place, the Pantherette teams cannot afford a
well-let’s-wait-until—mid—September-and-then-
maybe—we’ll-start-practice attitude. On the con-
trary, months of planning on the part of those
who coach the fall season squads may very well
add up to the most successful year ever for
“Pitt’s Winnin’ Women.”

Practices have already begun for the cross-
country team, while tennis, field hockey and
volleyball commence workouts this week.

Field hockey coach Janet McDowell returns
for her second year optimistic because her squad
is much more experienced this season. In its ’76
inaugural year, the team finished competition at
the .500 level, despite having only a few veteran
players. No longer rookies, these Pantherettes
open their season against Indiana at home Sep-
tember 29.

Several newcomers are from high schools of
impressive field hockey stature. Becky Martin
and Joanne List played for Manheim Central
High School’s 1976 PIAA championship team.
Avonworth High School, which participated in
the same state tournament, sends center-forward
Maureen Rupert. Also joining the team is Hem-
pfield High School’s Linda Eby, who also excells
in track and field. '

In “The Year of the Cat,” football wasn’t the
only Pitt sport to make headlines. The Pan-
therette volleyball team fought its way to a 23-3
record, including a fourth—place showing at the
Eastern Regional Tournament.

The squad, guided by coach Mike Hebert, has

all but one player returns to_Oakland- this fall. ,

Better still, two outstanding high school players
have"chos.en.. to attend Pitt-—Mar'ia’ Perez and
Ingrid Mueller. . ’

Perez, a setter from New York, is Staten
Island’s contribution to the United States’ East
National team which recently took on the
Chinese National squad and was one of the most
heavily—recrui‘ted volleyball players on the East
Coast.

Mueller, another New Yorker, is from
Cheektowaga, near Buffalo. The 5-11 hitter-
blocker spent her summer playing Olympic
Developmental volleyball, which is quite an
honor. ,

Pitt’s female netters will be holding open
tryouts this Friday at 4 p.m. on the courts behind
Trees Hall. Once the team is established, coach
Nancey Gordon and assistant Erma Tytka will
begin preparing the squad for competition again-
st Eastern tennis power Maryland, Lock Haven,
Slippery Rock, Indiana and Robert Morris.

Six players are once again ready to practice:
Maria Paris, Janet DeCostro, Janice Irwin, Nan-
cy Ballistreri, Pam Bockman and Jan Brown-
stein. Both superb singles players, Paris and
DeCostro were undefeated last year as a doubles
pair.

“I expect a lot from them this year,” says
Gordon, concerning the two. “As for the whole
team, I think we’ll be in much better shape this
time; we’ve been doing a lot of running. All
that’s left now is to pray for good weather.”

As for the cross-country team, well, compared
to their shaky season last year, ’77 should see
marked improvement. Besides having only five
member (four of whom had never run cross-
country before), numerous injuries darked spirits
as well as Pitt’s chances of winning a dual or tri-
meet.

Shrugging aside the past, coaches Freda Goff
and Mary Ellen Shea have more to look forward
to during the next three months. At least a pair
of promising freshmen join a nucleus of six
returnees.

“I know they (the freshmen) will start adding I
to the team immediately and I’m really excited,’? . I

Goff claimed.

“They” are Theresa Walton of ,Lancaster’,.. 
Ohio, and Diane Weigel, who attended North~-
Allegheny High School‘, one of Pennsylvania’s '

top cross-country schools. During her junior
year at Lancaster Catholic High School, Walton

finished second in the state Class A cross-country

meet and was running well last year until a bout
with bursitis kept her from the state race.

While at NAHS, Weigel was seventh in the
PIAA Class AAA cross-country championship.

Former Panthers Find a Home
In the National Football League

By KAREN KADILAK

A number of former Pitt football
players are enjoying successful
careers in the National Football
League.

The most publicized of the Pitt
foot_ball-playing alumni active in
pro football today is last year’s
Heisman Trophy winner, Tony
Dorsett. Dorsett, the Dallas
Cowboys’ number one selection in
the May player draft, has been
hampered by knee problems for
most of the pre-season, but is
expected to be ready for the
Cowboys’ regular season opener at
Minnesota September 18.

Dallas offensive coordinator Dan
Reeves said, “Dorsett seems to
have the three good things all the
good ones have. First of all, he
does things so easily. He also has
the great acceleration that means
so much in football. And he can
make the full-speed cut. Very few
runners have ever had the skill and
balance to change.”

Reeves likens Dorsett’s running

in his ability to cut without loss of
speed or balance.

One of the pre-season's more
interesting player moves involved
ex-Pitt star punter Larry Swider.
Swider. drafted in the seventh
round by the Denver Broncos this
past spring, was cut halfway
through the preseason. Swider,
one of the nation's leading punters
as a senior on last season's
national championship team, was
also cut following an ensuing
try-out with the Minnesota Vikings.

Swider’s rapid departure from
the pro ranks after a successful
four-year career at Pitt could be
traced to his being a three-step
punter. The pros prefer a two-step
punter. Swider is back at Pitt as a
graduate assistant on the Pitt
coaching staff. Two-step or
three-step, Panter kickers this
season figure to benefit from
Swider’s expertise.

Carson Long, who along with
Swider formed a potent one-two
kicking punch for the Panthers,
seems to have found himself a spot
on the Buffalo Bills’ roster. Long,
an eleventh-round draft choice of
Los Angeles this year, was cut by
the Rams to make room on the
roster for" the return of All—Pro

center Ron Saul, who came out of
retirement to rejoin the Rams.

In addition to Swider’s release by
both Denver and Minnesota. other
surprise cuts included Al Romano
(Houston) and Jim Corbett (Cincin-
nati). Meanwhile, Tampa Bay is
high on Cecil Johnson at line-
backer. Johnson was the starting
right defensive end for last year’s
national champs.

Don Parrish. a starting defensive
tackle for the ’76 Panthers, has a
good shot at making the Atlanta
Falcons at defensive end. Karl
Farmer, a world-class sprinter and
sure-handed wide receiver for the
Panthers several years ago, was
recently cut by the Falcons.
Farmer was a two-year veteran.

Gary Burley will start his second
straight season as a starting
defensive end for the Cincinnati
Bengals. Burley was an all-Amer-
ica candidate for the Panthers in
1974.

Two ex-Pitt Panthers are listed
on the Denver roster. Glenn Hyde
is scheduled for back-up duty at
offensive guard while Randy
Cozens. who spent last season on
the injured reserve list with a

knee injury. is being given a shot at - S

defensive end.

Bemis Seeking Punch In
Upcoming Soccer Season

By SAM SCIULLO

Offensive punch is what the Pitt
soccer team will be looking for,
according to coach Leo Bemis, as
preparations are under way for the
Sept. 10 opener at powerful Akron.

Last season, the Panthers
recorded a 4-7-2 mark in the
Western Pennsylvania Collegiate
Conference, but only managed 13
goals, the lowest point production
at Pitt in 25 years. So when coach
Bemis went recruiting last year he
looked for some goal scorers and
his efforts appear to have been
successful.

Freshmen Dan Hamm and John
O’Hara each bring ‘impressive

credentials to Pitt. Hamm, fromi

North Allegheny High School
(defending WPIAL champ), was
selected as the top player in the
WPIAL last year and received all
state honors, while O’Hara, who
comes from Mount Lebanon, was
rated the number-two performer
in the WPIAL. Another freshman.
Bob Hughes, of Central High
School in Philadelphia, will be
looked upon for scoring punch.
Bemis said that Pitt has had
_i;e_l_a_tively yogng teams the past two

seasons (with two freshman start-
ers last year), which meant the
Panthers didn’t have much depth
whenever injury and ailment
struck.

Bemis also said this year’s junior

class should be a good one and the) ‘V

blend of youth and experiencsfgi
should help the team.

“I think we’ve strengthened our
team in all positions,” he said. ‘‘I
think we'll have good depth.”

The experience and leadership
will be provided by several
returning players. .Included in that
group are senior goalie Frank Bucci
and the Nigh brothers—Mark, a
junior right fullback, and Karl, a
sophomore sweeper back.

Other returning players are
juniors Irwin Siegal (middle full-

back), Craig Connolly (left half-
back) and Tim Pearson. Sophomore

left halfback Rich Roccon. who last
year shared top scoring honors with
Mark Nigh with three goals, sho§"‘i«
also bolster Pitt's attack. 
Pitt plays its home games at Pitt
Stadium and all but one on Friday
evenings. More than 100 season
tickets have been sold to people

Boyd Boosts Harriers ’ Hopes

.ByJOHNFlNN

Mel Boyd is a man for all seasons.

Boyd, a senior from Donora,
excels in cross country as well as
indoor and outdoor track for the
Panthers. In other words, he is
always running—-from the muggy
hot summer through the chilly
autumn, to the dead of a freezing
winter.

Presently, Boyd and his team-
mates are preparing for the 1977
cross country campaign by running
between 60 and 100 miles weekly.

In addition to Boyd, coach Mike
Agostinella welcomes back veter-
ans Dave McDonald and Tim
Hermann, both of whom had
exceptional seasons last year.

Randy Baily from Neshannok
High School and Steve Moore from
Bethlehem High School are two
freshmen whom Agostinella be-
lieves will help the team.

“.011! season is juggled against
the football schedule,” Agostinella
claimed. “This year we are lucky to
have four home meets. Last year we
didn’t have any.”

Another reason for the lack of
recognition may be that cross
country is not exactly a spectator
sport. Watching a group of runners
tackle a six-mile course on a
Saturday morning does not attract
many fans.

However, recognition is not as
important to these athletes as
dedication. The preparation is
rigorous; the reward is victory. And
Agostinella is very optimistic about
victory this season.

“We have a lot of super people,”
he said, “and I am really looking
forward to a great season.” ..

Cross country is not the only sport
for which Agostinella———the coach
for all seasons—-invisions a good
year. His indoor and outdoor track

Again it is Boyd, a qualiﬁer for
Nationals in distance events for
three consecutive seasons, who will
anchor the group of veterans. In
addition, high-jumping Dan Good-
year, who also qualified for

p Nationals last season, returns for
his senior year.

Agostinella said he is leery of
mentioning his freshmen for fear of
putting too much pressure on them.
He did, however, mention Gene
Roach, a pole vaulter and Dave
Henson, a distance runner from
Delaware.

“The trouble with mentioning
names in track is that inevitably,
you forget about someone.”
Agostinella stated.“The fact is that
we have a strong nucleus of

group of promising recruits.

who has gained 6,469 yards in his
career, more than any other active
runner in the National Conference.

“I guess I have a long way to go,”
said Csonka, coming back from
knee surgery. He was hurt in the
11th game last season but he insists
that he has recovered totally from
the injury.

Still, the Giants, a team in
desperate need of some offense,
have preferred to go agonizingly
slowly with Csonka. And the big
back seems annoyed with that
arrangement.

“My job is to run the football,”
he said. ‘ ‘I would have liked to play
more and carry more. That might
get me back to par. But they
decided I would be more helpful as a
blocker.”

Coach John McVay would say
only: “Csonka is hurting. We

Csonka Giant Problem

planned to play him only one
quarter and that's what we did.”

Meanwhile, perhaps for insur-
ance, the Giants still have eight
running backs on their roster. It is
difﬁcult topﬁnd sufficient playing
time for all of them.

Csonka sat out the preseason
opener against New England and
has had limited work in the four
games since then. Overall, he has
carried the football 14 times for 38
yards and caught two passes for 14.

Csonka was asked if he’s happy.
He produced a direct, one-word

reply. .
“No," he said.

Q

Entertainment 

It Offers...

By JIM LEWIS

Bored?
There are enough diversiﬁed

forms of entertainment in town to
keep any student busy.

Music, theatre, sight-seeing and
sports all can be found‘ within a
small radius of Pitt’s campus.

For example, museum-browsers
will have a ﬁeld day at Carnegie
Museum (part of the Carnegie
Institute—museum, music hall and
library) across from Hillman
Library. The museum features
everything from prehistoric dino-
saurs to Egyptian mummies.
Admission is free on Saturdays.

The Frick Art Museum (on
Reynolds street—beyond the park-
king lot between Hillman and the
Carnegie Institute) not only houses
beautiful paintings, but Pitt stu-
dents as well (University classes are
held on upper ﬂoors(.

For a historical twist, try the Fort
Pitt Museum and Blockhouse in
grassy Point State Park downtown.
Not only do you get a taste of the
frontier days, but a sample of nature
as well, courtesy of the city’s green
rolling hills and many rivers.

The historical Society of Western
Pennsylvania (Bigelow Blvd.) and
the Nature Museum (Schenley

. Park) are nearby, are interesting,

and admission is free.

Three years living on-
campus have taken me from
the dorms to an apartment,
by way of a fraternity house.
Which is best? I’m not sure,

‘ ough each could be fun.

‘ My first two years at Pitt
were spent largely in Towers
A and B. Tower A is the
noisiest of the three towers,
though the decibel level has
eased somewhat since
females moved to some
floors a year ago. The
liveliness of a T0werA floor
was fun when a craving for
pinochle hit at 2 a.m., for
partners were present and
willing, but annoying-when
sleep or study was required.

Tower B was duller; all-
night card games ‘were
absent, as was putting 3
sleeping floormate to bed
in an elevator. Still, it W35
Towers life. ,

It was possible to live

entire days without stepplng
outside. Food, television,
vending machines and
neighbors were close at
hand.

If a Towers room offers
one large advantage over
other accommodations, it is
convenience. To make a 10

room occasionally; the
bathroom is cleaned daily.

A Three-Flavor Slice 0 -Campus Life

A fraternity house is in
many ways opposite a
dormitory. Rules are made
to be bent. Just as many

people live in the same
amount of space, but life is,
lesscrowded.“ ,

   
        
    
    
    

And the Food

It Serves
By PETER J. BUTCH

Restaurants are a great change
of pace for the Pitt student’s diet
and offer a chance to down a good
solid meal. But if area restaurants
are‘ chosen unwisely, the hard-
earned dollar can be wasted.

Though a student may be
desperate for a break from
cafeteria food, fast food, or a
roommate’s cooking, one should
realize that a restaurant meal can
cost five to seven times more than a
’ McDonalds’ snack and restaurants
don’t take cafeteria meal tickets.

Menus run the gamut from
old-fashioned home-cooking to the
bizarre. Almost all have liquor
licences, and restaurants even
serve freshmen as long as they
aren’t growing peach-fuzz mus-
taches " or stutter while ordering
from the bar.

On Forbes Ave., there is
Gustine’s, Cicero’s and C.J.
Barney’s. The first two offer the

most food for the least amount of A

money. Cicero’s leans on the
Italian side with anti-pastos and
pastas. Gustine’s is more of a
meat-and-potatoes place, although
excellent seafood is available.
C.J. Barney’s specializes in
“gourmet” hamburgers, omelets
and other exotic sandwiches‘.
“Gormet” means that toppings
such as bleu cheese, bacon, or
mushrooms are included on a
sesame-seed roll. Although the

burgers are twice the size of a Big -v

mac, they really aren’t worth the
price C..I.’s asks. And they want
disco prices for your cola, beer or
mixed drink.

Oakland Ave. offers the Taj. It’s
food is Indian, so if you’re

(Continued on, Page 25)

Mealtimes aren’t set, but }
neither is the table. Recipes 1
and cooking skill are in ‘
demand at a frat house.

Fraternity activities are
frekquent; most involve
alcohol, music and girls.
When a party is in progress,
however, most other activity
by necessity must cease.

Neither the housing office
or a landlord aids a
fraternity resident requiring
repairs. Most Greeks learn
about soffit and facia, water-
heater diverters and
plastering before they’ve
even hit their first 100-level
course.

The area in which most
Pitt fraternity houses are
located isn’t a bad, in most
cases, Baskin Robbins is
nearby. The Bayard Street
area has one of the lowest
crime rates in Pittsburgh.

The most important ‘
prerequisite for living in a
fraternity house, however is
becoming a brother.
Currently, only some 1,100
Pitt students have in
apartment than in dorms or
fraternity houses for a
variety of reasons, mainly
because dorm and
fraternity houses for a
variety of reasons, mainly
because dorm and frat
space are limited. Finding a
good apartment sometimes
appears to be a fitting

in a wide range of varsity sports,
from women’s ﬁeld hockey to tennis
to gymnastics to soccer.

fancy, then your fancy will be ticled
by many student groups and
ensembles performing in such
places asvthe Cathedral, the Music

(Pitt Campus).

Even those who can’t be

How about Kennywood Park?
The Pittsburgh amusement park,
which claims to be the “Roller
Coaster Capital” of the world,
features the exciting Thunderbolt,

rated by the New York Times as the
country’s best coaster.

For a less harrowing ride, try the
Duquesne and Monongahela In-
clines which, coupled with the Mt.
Washington Overlook, provide a
spectacular view of Pittsburgh.

Science majors can’t "miss the
Phipps Conservatory (Schenley
Park). Allegheny Observatory
(North Side). or the Buhl Planetar-
ium (North Side). All display
interesting exhibits, while Buhl
features its famous star shows in its
dome-ceiling theatre.

Animal enthusiasts will get a kick
out of the Aviary (Schenley Park),
which provides bird watchers with
thousands of species in a natural
setting, and the Pittsburgh Zoo in
Highland Park, where hundreds of
kinds of animals from all parts of the
world (not to mention schools of ﬁsh
in the aqua-zoo) are displayed.

Your Choice at Pitt

(Continued f7'°"' Page 23)
uncertain about curried anything,
be careful. The price is more than
reasonable, it's cheap. if you don't
mind eating off paper plates with
plastic forks.

On Atwood Street is the Black
Angus. Cornucopia and La Fondue.

All three are beyond the means of
an ordinary undergraduate. La
Fondue is a new, expensive French
restaurant. Food is reputed to be
excellent. service adequate. It is
easy for a couple to spend $50 in
one evening there. so beware.

The Cornucopia is a vegetarian
restaurant. Its food is not very
ﬁlling and by the time you ﬁnish
sampling appetizers. entrees and
salads. you’ve run up a bill of $15
to $25. The food is very interesting
and a student should try this place
at least once.

The Black Angus attracts football
recruits and medical school faculty
for lunch. One look at menu prices
will conﬁrm this.

Oakland also has a plethora of
Syrian restaurants. One thing all

have in common is that they ﬁll you ,

up on cheap appetizers and then

bring you a shish-ka-bob with few
cubes of beef.

There’s a Greek restaurant on
Walnut Street in Shadyside, for
those who are up to travel. It’s
called the Ikaros and the food is
indeed authentic. It’s also very
good.

And, of course, a quick scan of
the yellow pages will turn up all the
Red Bull Inns, Steak and Ales and
other franchise restaurants you’d
ever need.

As for quick and courteous
service, Gustine’s is the best,
followed by Cicero’s. At Cornu-
copia the waiters and waitresses
usually explain the vegetarian
menu very courteously and cheer-
fully. Occasionally you’ll get a
snob who cannot tolerate people
who don't understand the herbi-
verous lifestyle. At C..I.’s many
waitresses. especially at lunch
time. try to hurry you along, clear
your plates and write up your
check.

On the whole. students will ﬁnd
0akland’s restaurants a welcome
break from cafeteria food and less
‘of a challenge. too.

WHAT IS A GENERIC

AND HOW CAN YOU SAVE

0%?

A generic drug is one which is identified by its official
chemical name rather than an advertised brand name.
Generic drug manufacturers can sell at lower prices
because the company does not have a sales force or ex-
pensive advertising campaign.

In most instances, an equivalent generic drug can be sub-
stituted for a brand name one at a lower-cost to the con-
sumer. This is made possible by the fact that the brand
name and its generic substitute have the some chemical
make-up.

The Generic Drug Act — Act 259 was passed in Pen-
nsylvania on November 24, 1976. This Act allows phar-
macists to substitute the less expensive generic drug for
the more costly name brands whenever possible, unless
the prescribing physician or patient states otherwise.

HERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT

POINTS OF THE NEW LAW
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW

When your doctor writes a prescription, it is up to him or
her to indicate on the prescription blank whether or not a
lower cost generic drug may be substituted for a brand

 

~‘  name one. Sometimes a doctor has a good reason for

prescribe a lower cost generic arug or you.

Not all medications have a generic equivalent. Remember
to consult your doctor or pharmacist to find out which
drugs do.

When a pharmacist substitutes a less expensive
generically equivalent drug, he or she will inform you of
that fact, as well as explaining the difference in price
between the two. The purchases has the right to refuse a
generic substitution.

Generic drug substitutes are safe and just as effective as
the brand name equivalent. you now join consumers in
some 20 other states who have enacted similar
legislation. All generic substitutions have been approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Pen-
nsylvania Department of Health. In addition, they must

meet standards outlined in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or the :

National Formulary.

the landlord gives a passing
imitation of Darth Vader.
Apartments get. more
expensive with better
furnishings, more rooms and
a location closer to campus.
The average apartment
offers more privacy than
dorms or a frat house,
though security is sometimes
especially in
I unsavory areas.

Apartments couple
responsibility and
independence. It’s up to the
tenant to decide when (or it)
to clean the place. You
usually must pay for utilities;
the phone bill always is
yours.

Often you’l1 enter a new
apartment to find the phone
missing or a utility turned
off. A timely (read three
weeks prior) call to the
appropriate company can
eliminate that worry,
though.

South‘ Oakland isn’t as

.. attractive as North Oakland,
‘though neighbors can be a
problem if stereo volume is

too high in North Oakland.
Some students escape to East
Liberty, Shadyside or
Squirrel Hill. A car is almost
a necessity for a student

living in one of those
sections, however, unless he

can afford] frequent and
expensive bus trips. In many
ways, living in the eastern
suburbs is like commuting.

Generating rent money
each month also can be a
problem. Though Pitt wants
all its room and board fees in
advance, a student who’s
paid that bill can sleep_and
eat easily for four months.

bled in small, but no less
painful, amounts.

One advantage of living in
an apartment involves
roommates. It’s rare for an
apartment-dweller to find
himself rooming with a
stranger, as is occasionally
the case in the dorms. Also,
there aren’t 30 or 40

fraternity members to get on
your nerves, even if they are
“brothers.”

Two or three roommates,
popular arrangements in
campus apartments, often is
ideal.

For non-commuters,
campus (or near-c:ampus)
living is a necessary, but not-
so—evil, arrangement for
several years. It can be the
worst part of school, though
some persons find it to be the
best.

Many persons spend some
time in the dorms and move
to an apartment or fraternity
house after tiring of cafeteria
food or after missing the
housing deadline. Whether
that reflects a need for
change or the superiority of
non-dorm accomodations,
every student will have to
learn himself.

‘Annie’: A Mvsiedl Made
In ‘Cheer Up’ America  

By LEONARD ROMBERG

“Annie,” the latest success of

.the American musical stage, is

“s-

u 45!.

a

fascinating for several reasons. The
Tony award-winning comic strip-
tumed-musical has deﬁed many
unwritten laws of how to succeed
today on the Broadway stage.
Thomas Meehan, Charles _

Strouse and Martin Charnin wrote
the book, music and lyrics. to a
musical non-comic version of
“Little Orphan Annie.”

“Annie” has no deep meaning,
no irony and nothing symbolic. It is
just outright entertainment. There
is no rock music, no electric guitar;
just simple catchy tunes and lyrics
reminiscent of the 1930s.

It has nothing offensive; no hard
. uage, no nudity, no sex. It
does have innocent children,
villains and heroes.

Originally, the story goes,
“Annie” was created in the early
1970’s as a response to the
depressed mood of America in light
of Vietnam, Watergate and reces-
sion. Meehan said it was to display
a sign of hope that tomorrow would
bring happier times.

However, as Meehan wrote,
5 ' es have changed, Jimmy Carter

ii President and the economy is

improving, so Annie is more a
“mirror” of the nation today. But
despite that, we can all use some
cheering up and a refreshing
change of pace.

The show is set back in the
depression days when President
Roosevelt was just beginning his
long stay in office. Scene one shows
the New York City Municipal
Orphanage and seven ragged girls
being abused by the mean Miss
Hanigan who runs the orphanage.

 Annie, whom Hannigan dislikes

most, tries to escape the orphanage
twice but does not succeed. Just as
she is about to be beaten, the

secretary of billionaire Oliver
“Daddy” Warbucks arrives and
says Warbucks has offered to take
an orphan home for the Christmas
holidays. *

Naturally, Annie is the lucky
choice, and off she goes to. the
Warbuck mansion. It’s not‘ difficult
to guess the ending.

Though everything works out in
the end (it wouldn’t be ‘ ‘Annie’ ’ if it
didn’t), there are a few stumbling
blocks and experiences to be had
before the story can wind up and the
threatregoers can go home.

Those scenes highlight the show
which keeps the audience interest-
ed even though they know how it
ends. The audience sees a

%‘_:\i‘iii/i’-'8

recreation of the ’30s when Annie
visits a “Hooverville” whose

tenants have gone from riches to ‘

rags. the Hooverville-ites curse the
forme‘r President singing:

“. ..In every pot he said a
chicken,

but Herbert Hoover he .
forgot;

Not only ain ’t we got the
chicken,

We ain ’t got the pot”

The simplicity is almost ‘frighten-
ing but the audience eats it up and
enjoys the song and dance to the

utmost .

Billion Dollar Babies’

Not Worth One Cent

By JIM FARERI

Battle Axe
Billion Dollar Babies
Polydor

Billion Dollar Babies is three-
fifths the old Alice Cooper
entourage plus two. Michael Bruce
(guitar and lead vocals), Dennis
Dunaway (bass) and Neal Smith
(drums) have not stamped vinyl
since the last Alice Cooper (group)
LP, and, judging from “Battle
Axe,” they should have stayed in
their post-rock star (i.e. millionaire)

retirement indeﬁnitely.
,“Battle Axe” 1S carelessly

calculated at the Kiss-prone
audience, high school freshmen
making the AM/ FM transition but
ﬁnding the Eagles and Fleetwood
Mac as soporiﬁc as Lawrence Welk.
As Bruce screeches “Too Young,”
the first track about the Strum and
Drang of domestic adolescent life,
old Alice Cooperphiles (who might
have went for this stuff six years
ago) cringe and wish they had left
“Battle Axe” to little brothers.

Didn’t these senior rockers
realize that it would be the over-20
ex-“Love It To Death”/ “Killer”
enthusiasts who would sample this
partial ressurrection of their
once-favorite band? Bruce, who
was the prime mover in those LPs, is
capable of more than the cliches and
mediocrities of “Battle Axe,” a
beginning course in rock basics at
best.

A few numbers hold their own as
tight rock pieces; ‘‘I Miss You,”
“Love Is Rather Blind” and ‘ ‘Dance
With Me” meet the minimal
qualifications for good rock: sound
chord progressions, catchy

choruses, etc. However none of
these tunes sparkle with the little bit
extra that makes of exceptional
music. There are none of the
nuances of playing style or voice
that characterized Alice Cooper’s
hit singles, most of which Bruce
wrote.

Even an attempt at novelty is
stale. The latter half of side-two
insists upon some sort of mini-epic
concerning a battle for the welfare
of rock ’n"roll(?). Luckily the album
ends here: an extension of this kind
of tackiness, both in music and lyric,
catalyzes disappointment into dis-
gust.

On top of this, the album is
disasterously produced. Every-
thing is buried in a tomb of fuzz and
the quality of sound is adversely
affected. The production that is
hiding something, probably Bruce's
vocal, which is obviously still the
vocal of Alice Cooper’s mute
rhythm guitarist.

With Alice Cooper’s (the man's)
improptu, too-rich-to-care solo
career glowing bright in the minds
of old Alice Cooper group fans, the
Billion Dollar Babies are reaffirm-
ingthe old band's rock .roots. But
they do so without the verve and
sincerity of a legitimately new rock
group. Rather, they play like what
they are: wealthy young men who
were once stars, returning to rock
’n’ roll half-cocked, probably out of
boredom.

Sadly, these three genuine Billion
DollarBabies are bumt-out and out
of touch. The old Alice Cooper
lyricism and charisma ﬂed even
before the band disbanded andfsift
to be rekindled" by those who must
blow dust off of gold-plated gulﬂims.

Hope Toward Iomorrow

/Continued from Page 31)

The next target for spooﬁng is the
scene at the radio station where
Warbucks goes on the air to offer a
$50,000 reward to anyone who can
prove they are Annie’s parents.
The “Hour of Smiles” resembles a
1930s radio show, complete with
huge microphones, simulated tap-
dancing, toothpaste ads, and the
“Boylan Sisters.”

Finally, we see President Roose-
velt with Annie, who is right there
with her innocent optimism to help
the President and his cabinet invent
the New Deal.

The makers of “Annie,” notably
Mike Nichols, were bold in creating
such_a show. It is corny at times, but
one excuses that when the play is
on.

‘Star Wars’ Albums

By PETER J . BUTCI_I

Though it still shows in the
first-run theatres, the milking of the
science-ﬁction hit Star‘ Wars has
already begun. Not only can you

Iﬁnd T-shirts, posters and buttons,

but two albums also have been
produced that contain the movie’s
theme.

One is the Twentieth-Century
Fox release of the movie sound-
track. The other is a disco
interpretation of the score.

‘One thing that tends to mislead
those unfamiliar with motion

picture soundtrack albums is that no
dialogue is included. Without
visual stimulation, some parts of the
score are boring, indeed.

The genuine soundtrack, by the
London Symphony conducted by
Andre Previn, is at its best during"
the opening and closing themes.
The rich brass provides an air of
pomp and circumstance that is
escapism at its best. Only two other
tracks inspire vivid recollection of
scenes; the 12-minute track that
backed the death star battle and the
music played in the bar-room in the
Mos Eisley spaceport.

It is those crazy, bordering the
ridiculous scenes which gives the
show its appeal. The time was right
to bring Annie to Broadway because
the simplicity was a welcome
change to many theatregoers.

That is only because people are
basically still pessimistic about the
future and they need a few hours at
the theatre to help cheer themselves

up.

‘R

Can’t Forget the Bar Scene

The battle music alternates
between brass percussion and
strings, creating alternate moods of
anticipation, encounter“ and disap-
pointment. It works up to a ﬁnale
which anti-climaxes to the accom-
pany the death star's fluttering
apart intotiny, bright, twinkling
pieces. I

The futuristic ragtime played by
the cantina musicians cannot help
but conjure up the barrom and its
assortment of galactic creatures on
the lam.

A The remainder of the album is a
conglomeration of themes that set
moods for various scenes. Without
the action, however, they’re lost.

The other album has had its
version of the theme receive much
_AM airplay, providing jocks a lazy
way to segue into the news. The
album, Star Wars and other
Intersalactic Funk by Miko is not
entirely movie theme.

Although Millenium records
jumped the gun and quickly
produced Miko’s version, it became
more popular than the original
soundtrack as he was able to use a
synthesizer to reproduce the sound
of richocheting laser bolts and the
whistles and beeps of android
R2D2, much to the delight of

' adolescent fans.

If one wishes to participate in the
milding of Star Wars, the best bet is
to get the Twentieth-Century Fox

“original soundtrack release.

Though it may be boring at times, it
prepares the listener for a better

Star Wars is still very much alive. Moviegoers have a choice of two records to appreciation ofthe movie when they
buy it they want to remember the scenes such as this one. go to see it again.

The controversial treatment of mental illness, as it is
and how it was portrayed in the Academy Award-winning .
film ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,’ is the subject of
the documentary special ‘Inside the Cuckoo’s Nest,’
Thursday, Sept. 8 on PBS.

The focus of this unusual documentary is not issues,
nor answers; it is people, their interpersonal relation-  i
ships and their relationship to an institution. The institu- ' 5|“!!! CGIIWY
tion is the Oregon State Hospital, the 90-year-old mental v W¢""‘°' 3'°f- 3067
institution in Salem, Oregon which also served as the set— .
ting for the film.

The program contains excerpts from the motion pic-
~—-tture and behind-the-scenes coverage of the 1975 movie
 ﬂmaking experience. Both are juxtaposed with a series of
intimate views of patients filmed during a return to the
Oregon State Hospital in 1977. .

The people range from criminals, child abusers, drug
addicts and alcoholics to persons suffering from general
mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and manic
depressive reactions; from therapists and other hospital
staff to actors such as Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher
and William Redfield.

Oregon State Hospital, which was founded in 1883 as
an asylum for the insane, has evolved into a modern
therapeutic community. ‘inside the Cuckoo’s_ Nest’
documents the principal forms of therapy now practiced
there: group therapy sessions, individual treatment
teams, electr0—convu|sive therapy and drug therapy.

Dr. Brooks (who played Dr. Spivey in the film) states:
“I was more concerned over the shooting of the
..documentary than in the making of a controversial
film...‘lnslde the Cuckoo's Nest’ is an inside view of a
mental hospital without any window dressing. My col-
leagues may not like it, as it does not ‘promote’ the pro-
fession. However, lam content that it portrays patients as
persons, rather than as caricatures or as articles to be
moved around; something no movie or documentary on
mental illness I am familiar with has ever done."

Check your local PBS station for broadcast day and time. ‘
