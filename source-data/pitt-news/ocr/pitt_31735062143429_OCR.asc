to Student Council and oﬂicer posi-
tions in the College Association.
_Though marked by pre-election ac-
cusations of irregularities which
broughtvabout a special meeting of
Student Council to investigate the
charges of ineligibility of Council
candidates, Friday's election was the
most orderly in the ten years of the
existence of the student “legislature."

A few attempts were made by stu-
dents to “repeat,” after voting, on
borrowed registration cards during
the day, which resulted in four cards
being seized by ballot box watchers
in Alumni Hall. Owners of the
seized cards are to be called into the
office of Walter J. Rome, assistant
dean of men, this week, to explain
their action of illegal voting.

Pluralities of 20 to 40 votes were
registered by candidates representing
the “coalition” over the opposition
fraternity and independent represen-
tatives.

The race between Jules Green and

Irving Robbins for the oﬁice of junior
councillor in the College attracted
the most attention during the day's
voting. Robbins, running as a non-
fraternity independent, was defeated
271-245, Green holding a 26 vote plu-
rality.

representative to Student Council
over Howard A. Cohen, Ralph Kyper,
and Charles Januska, V polling 240
votes, a plurality of 31 votes over

of approximately 600 eligible votes.

position over Nathan Ganger, Bernard
Rosenson, Richard Fisk, and Edgar
Dowling.

School,-. for junior-_ and «senior repre-
sentative to Student Council. Joseph
Mikesic and Jack McFarland receiv-
ed a majority of the votes cast, to be
declared winners over K. Paul Derr
and Wilson Renne.

times the vote received by his oppo-
nent, Ralph Pannier, in the junior
representative to Council in the

ping, , junior, ,counci1or:.,,and Betty

aus, senior -representative over Hel-
en -Milliron, Helen Hoeveler, Frances

tion to the fraternity “coalition”

Jarvis, '33, president of the group,

stated that doormen will make cer-
tain that each ticket is bonaﬁde when
presented at the entrance. This will
be done, he said, in an effort to check
an old Association bugaboo springing
out of members selling their tickets
for one dance at reduced rates.

tendants. With the addition of the
goddess and her company to the an.

lished a new tradition. Nominated by

the junior executive committee, the
Goddess of Rhythm and her attend-

ants are the ﬁrst representative group

burgh, primarily on the basis of class
“A” health; the other requirements
were outstanding leadership as well
as poise and stately appearance, Du;-.
ing the spring elections all women on
campus voted on the ten nominees;
the onereceiving the highest num.

ber of votes became the Goddess, the
next ﬁve highest became he-r attend-
ants.

Opening with the torch procession
led by Betty Quarrie and her com-
Dany, followed by ten members of the
Women’s Glee Club, the ﬁrst part of
the program of dances will be_ com-
prised of more serious and thought-
provoking interpretations. First, the
dancers will illustrate the Greek
games, then the unmerciful actions of
Indian warriors; Symphonic Interpre-
tation follows with movements coin-
ciding with the rhythm ofthe music.
Fire Dance, Valse Brilliante and At
Daybreak continue the ﬁrst part of
the Dance Drama; the conclusion will
be brought about by Persecution and
Faith, Russian Snowstorm ‘and Rhap-
sody, :

scarfs will characterize Cloud Dreams.
After the singing of Alma Mater, the
dancers leave the Goddess of Rhythm

annual Dance Drama, will conclude
with a Recessional,

The May Fete is an educational
project to stimulate creative dancing
under the direction of Mrs. Frances
R. Tracy, of the physical education de-
partment. All the dances are original
with no stereotyped routine to be
memorized; the purpose of the dancers
is to bring about one certain emotional
effect by their movements. No elab-
orate effects will be made; the cos-
tumes will be neutral, suggesting
rather than portraying; all effects will
be brought about by the lighting,
music and expressionistic movements
of the dancers.

Yesterday the Sport Side-Lights,
WAA’s ofﬁcial news organ, appeared
on campus, explaining the various
angles of the dance presentation as
well as other WAA activities. In the
paper are descriptions of the dances
and the entire cast of the May Fete,
which numbers approximately eighty
women. 1

Sports Dance

Friday night the ﬁrst and only all-
University dance of the year will be-
gin at 9 o'clock in the huge Grotto
ballroom on the North Side, while two
eleven-piece orchestras stage a four-
hour battle of music to an audience
popularity decision.

At a cost of $1.50 per couple, the

' lowest «price ever set for a major Uni-

versity dance, tickets ’-have -been sell-
ing rapidly throughout the last week.
A crowd of _-800 couples is anticipated
for the affair and the ballroom, men-
tioned as t-he largest in this section of

the state, is easily large enough to ac-
commodate a much greater crowd with‘
comfort. V ,

The Daum-Sanderson orchestra,"
which has been playing each Satur-,
day night .at the .Sch.enley Supper
Club, .and Rosenbergis Collegians of‘
Youngstown, 0., a popular ..unit in that
section and a -regular feature at Idora
Park, in ‘Eastern Ohio, -will present al-
ternate dance numbers throughout the
evening.
Two features of the dance will be
the presentation of all cups won -in
i-nteriraternity competitions Thursday
and Friday, and the distribution of
copies of the ‘,‘_Ra.zz Rag” tabloid,
More than .a dozen shining bronze and
silver trophies will be removed from
their perches in the oﬂice of the dean
of men -to add to .already -extensive
collections on the maiitels of precious-
metal hoardin-g fraternities. The cup
for the Track Meet stands highest,
' challenged by the Sweepstakes and

the American public.
As has been previously announced.
the dance is strictly a éjallorts affair.
Any costume whatever will be passed
at-t-he door, so long as it comes in any
detail under the head of sp_0.I‘t_S- Willte

Trackmen
Win Mile
Relay Title

Break Four-Year University
Record to Win Penn
Championship

 

Prepare For W. Virginia

 

The Blue and Gold made its ﬁrst
‘bid in recent years for national rec-
ognition at the Penn RelayS Friday
and Saturday of last week returning
home with a mile relay championship,
a third place in a special sprint relay
event, and honorable mention in the
100.yard dash event.

Running against Manhattan, Army,
Ohio ‘State, -Michigan State, Colum-
bia. Navy. and Temple, Kiger, Mc-
Donald, Watkins, and Keller circled
the Franklin ﬁeld track in 3121.3 to
win the class B mile relay champion-
ship in the Penn track and ﬁeld
Carnival.

In winning the relay eyellt. the
Panther trackmen broke the Univer-
sity record a four years standing.

Arveil Fleming, the only man en-
tered in events other than the team

relays, after reaching the semi-ﬁnal.

in‘ the 100-yarddash trials was elim-
inated from further competition.

Although placing third in the sprint
relay, Bill Keller running as anchor
man in the 880-yard half of the mile,
ran to a new unofficial University rec-
ord by runninghis, distance in the
fast time of 1:57, but his time could
not close the gap which Manhattan
had made to take this event.

While the relay team was at Phil-
-adelphia, freshmen and varsity were
preparing for the ﬁrst home track
meet of the season, scheduled for
Saturday afternoon at the -Stadium
against West. Virginia. The meet,
a._ dual one, will see both the fresh
men and varsity participating in the
meet, for the ﬁrst time this year.

The meet is to be part of the track

and ﬁeld program of the day being-

planned in conjunction with the
twenty.sixth annual University schol-
astic track and ﬁeld meet.

It seems that Trader Howdy 0’Dell

Notwithstanding any statements in
the local newspapers to the contrary,
Jack Schricker, who captains the Pitt
boxers next year, will not be entered
in the State Amateur tournament to
be held at the Stadium.

Now that the Cap and Gown
show is over, the boys can go back
to their old trades. And when
you come to think of it, Jack
Wyatt, who had quite a part in the
show, may get somewhere as a
member of the Panther wrestling
team next year,

Ganger’s defeat in the tennis match
with George Washington at the Sta-
dium court last Friday was the ﬁrst
singles match that he has lost since
entering Pitt. Which may be some-
what of a record.

I wonder what happened to the
basketball‘ tournament that Doc-
tor Carlsdn staged-at the Stadium
pavilion? The‘ idea was a good
one, but for some reason or other,
the publicity boys failed to give
the good doctor a break.

It is interesting to note that the
Pitt boxing coach, Joe Orsi-nil, has
been granted a license to referee pro
bouts. Some club will be doing them-
selves a ﬁnancial favor by using him
as an official. The large amount of
favorable publicity would be very,
very helpful.

Of course it may only be a pipe
dream, but a good authority states
that the basketball‘ team's pro-
posed trip to foreign parts was
vetoed-. They may,. however, visit
the coast once more.

The acquisition of Coach Carl Olsen ‘
has raised the place of Panther track
teams to a new high. The broken
records and brilliant performances
turned in by the Pitt speeders should
make a track conscious public of a
disintersted student body.

Now that the Swimming. clinic
of "Pat Corr’s has been success-
fully concluded, the open season
seems to be nearing its end. Two
days have passed, and no new
clinic has been announced.

And once and for all, this column
does not interview prospective appli-
cants for the recently vacated “All-

Net Team Splits
Weekend Matches

Upset in George Washington
Meet, Win Easily Over Bethany

Two matches, one victory, and one
defeat was the outcome of the past
week-end activities for the Pitt tennis
team. An upset victory by the George
Washington team at the Stadium
courts Friday, and a crushing. of the
Bethany squad at Bethany Saturday
accounted for the results.

Billy O’Laugh1in started what looked
like a Pitt victory by defeating R.
Scherfy, George Washington, in the
initial singles match on Friday, but
Nate Ganger was upset, 6-1, 6-4, by L.
Sllerfy to even the count. Slocum, Pitt
was defeated as were Solow and Gurin.
Of the two doubles: matches, the team
of Ganger and O’Laughlin defeated
the Scherfy brothers, and the Pitt
double team of Slocum and Gurin
were defeated by Robinson and Smith
of George Washington.

Bethany College's tennis team
proved no match for the Panther net
team at Bethany, Saturday,‘ the Pitt
team winning rather easily, 6-2.

6 Sports Events Carded
For Greek Competition
During Spring Festival

 

The ﬁrst interfraternity event of
Spring Festival Week, the track meet,

will t-a.ke place Thursday afternoon.
4 o’clock at the Stadium. All.

at
men’s fraternities have signiﬁed in-
tention of placing contestants in each
of the ten events of the meet, ac-
cording to Robert Chamberlain, Col.

’33‘, meet chairman.

Meanwhile, entries for both of the
men’s fraternity features of the
week’s festivities—-—the track meet and
the sweepstakes are due today at noon
in the office of the dean of men.
Each fraternity may register two men
and a substitute for nine events and
four men and two substitutes for the
special 880-yard relay; no man may
enter more than two events with the
exception of the relay, and all men
must be certiﬁed by ‘Mr. Theodore
W. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men. Sweepstakes -entries will prob-
ably show a n-umber of fraternities
not competing this year because their
cars were wrecked last year or are
otherwise unﬁt for further competi-
tion. New cars are at present too
expensive to build for at least three
or four Greek letter groups.

All the entries are now in for the
women’s fraternities“ four Festival
events: the ﬂoat parade or “Parade of
the Pantherettes;” the hoop. race;
the roller skating relay, and the
scooter relay. According to Gladys
Pyle, Col. ’33, coed’ chairman of
Spring Festival’ Week, ten women’s
groups have placed contestants in
No further on-
tries can be made, she insisted.

The ten track meet contests in-
clude: 100-yard dash; 220-yard dash;
440.-yard dash; 120-yard low hurdl~'es.;

‘-high jump; pole vault (a new events);
‘broad jump; hop, step

and jump;
baseball throw; and special 880-yard

relay. Trophies will be awarded for
the winners of ﬁrst and second places
in each event.

On Friday afternoon the ﬂoat pa-
the program at 1:30

to the Stadium at 1:15 o’clock prompt-
ly. The hoop rolling race starts at
2:30 o’clock from Bigelow. and Bay-
ard and ﬁnishes at Tennyson ‘Street.
The roller skating relay begins at
2:45 o’clock and the scooter race is
scheduled for 3:00 o’clock, both races
alsio beginning at Bigelow and Bay-
ar .
I The sweepstakes course will follow
the customary route, beginning at the
bookstore, down Bayard Street to
Bel-leﬁeld; up Belleﬁeld to Center
avenue, and then meeting Bigelow
and following that -street to the ﬁnish
line at Bigelow and Bayard. There
will’ be four relays of “pushers.”

The relays will be stationed at the
First Baptist Church; at the SAE
fraternity house; and at Schenley
High -School. Neutral checkers and
timers will be in charge, according to
John Holbrook, Eng. ’34, chairman.

All the trophies, and prizes won in
the men’s and women’s fraternity
events will be distributed at the
Sports Dance, Friday night.

Robbins Resigns; Campbell, Go-

The annual election meeting of
Druids was interrupted Sunday after-
noon when charges of “farce”
and “burlesque” followed the an-
nouncement of the list of candidates
elected. Following these charges
three members withdrew from the
meeting, one tendering his resigna-
tion.

Declaring that he didn't care to=

be affiliated with the Druids be-
cause of their methods of electing

new members, which he characterized.

as “systematically unfair to the best
candidates,” Irving D. Robbins re-
signed from the organization.

Donald Campbell and George Go-
lanty sustained Robbins in his state-
ment and declared that obviously
a. coalition to elect certain candidates
had been formed without regard to
their qualiﬁcations.

A motion to consider as elected
only those who had been unanimous-
ly elected or who had only one vote
against them was voted down be-
cause of a clause in the Druid con-

candidates should be elected on the

duce the most intelligently conceived piece of polite propaganda
that has yet sprung from a Cap and Gown author's pen.

~ Without‘ question, “All to the Point” was the most ambitious
production that Cap and Gown has yet attempted in the twenty-six
years of its history at the University. A more difficult assignment
was never handed‘ any director, author or composer. And the same

applies to the students who were

members of the cast and chorus.

“All to the Point” was, as we have remarked, an intelligently
conceived piece of polite propaganda. That is what made it, in our
estimation, the most ambitious production in Cap and Gown history.
Not every previous production has come as the result of an appreci-
able amount of conscious brain work, of an exercise of mind moti-

vated by "a deﬁnite purpose.

Previous Cap and Gown shows, it is plain, have been designed
to entertain and, at the same time, to produce a “warm” feeling
toward the University. The second point always has been and, in
our opinion, will continue to be the secondary purpose of the organ-

ization. Just as every other Univ

ersity activity is an advertisement

and polite propaganda for the University, so is Cap and Gown and
each of its productions. While previous shows sought to produce
only a “warm” feeling toward the institution, “All to the Point”
was a commendable attempt to do more—to entertain and to create

an “understanding” of the place
undeniably great community.

of a. really great university in an

The only unfortunate thing about this year's show was the fact
that its content and form were decided upon at almost the very last

minute, after well-laid plans for

duction had been virtually completed.

an entirely different type of pro-
“All to the Point," unfor-

tunately, disrupted plans for what might have been, at least in part,

a ‘ ‘student-written" show.

In order to guard against the repetition of such an occurrence,
the Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club should begin making its
plans—now—for next year’s production. If Cap and Gown is to
justify its existence on the University campus as a student organ-
ization, thoseplans should be for a. “student-written and student-

produced’ ’ show.

Director Marlatt has committed himself more than once on the

old, old question.

He wants to direct a student show for students

more than any other single individual connected with the club.

There are many others, members

Morevthan once the members of the “old guard” have expressed

their desire to see a student-written show. Individually and col-
lectively they have made gestures in that direction. But when stu-
dent material was not forthcoming to a satisfactory amount or

quality, they have re-gathered in

the reins of control and brought

another “extravaganza” out'of the hat.

Student action by the Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club alone
can be successful in eventually producing a “studen ” show. More
than half the diﬁiculty will be overcome if they begin making plans

DOW.

Undergraduates look to this undergraduate organization for
something which it alone can accomplish. Another year of lethargy
and another show “not written by students” will attach a stigma to
both the. Graduate and Undergraduate Clubs which will not easily

be explained away.

47 Rec;eiveHigher Degrees

'In...Ioint Engineer Courses.

 

Forty-se_ven‘._ men "have received
higher degrees in engineering from
the University “of Pittsburgh through
the Universltyig‘ ‘graduate program
in cooperation with the Westinghouse
Electric and Manufacturing Com-
pany since the program was begun
in 1927, according to a report just is-
sued by  A. Holb-rook, dean of
the University's" Schools of Engi.
neering and Mines, and E. A. Rob-
erts, of the ‘Educational Department
of Westinghouse.

The forty-seven men include grad-
uates of thirty-two American Univer-
sities and four foreign technical uni-
versities. Among the foreign institu-
tions represented were the University
of New Zealand. and, Wltwatersand
University,‘ South Africa. '

In 1931-32, 26 higher degrees were
conferred as opposed to two confer-
red at the end of 1927-28, the year in

begun. Practically all
the cooperative courses, are at the
present time employed, Dean Hol-
brook states. _

The cooperative program, given by
engineers of the Weﬁstinghouse
Company, has included technical pro-
fessional engineering courses. Uni-
versity faculty members have given
work in mathematics, physics, and
economlcs.

was limited by earlier regulations to

Inside Looking Out

...ByW

IT USED to be a favorite complaint that the United States provided

a stifling enviromnent because it was not like Europe. In view of

the atmosphere that the smug American prosperity of the nineteen-
twenties provided, it was a pretty good idea.

But there is not exactly what could be called a continental mania.

on now, even among the younger intellectuals who are always mak-

ing themselves self-imposed exiles.
the United States is a virtual pa.ra%

F.A....

‘O

Compared to Adolf’s Germany,

dise for brain-worker and laborer
alike. For one thing, there has been
a. change in Europe. And for anoth-
er, there has been a. change in the
states.

No small part of the change on this
side has been extremely recent, some
of it only in evidence since March 4.
The nationalism of the Republican
administrations, which took its most
notable expression ‘in a. high tariff
policy, has given way to a foreign
policy reminiscent of the Democratic
party of old times. President Roose-
velt gave deﬁnite notice of his atti-
tude on tariffs when he picked Hull
as his Secretary of State, for Hull's
utterances on this subject have been
clear enough. And Roosevelt's will-
ingness to meet. with foreign states-
men in an attempt to clear up trade
questions by treaty is indicative of a
really unprovincial thinking.

Determiner of Policy

Undoubtedly a. good part of Roose-
.velt’s policy is. to be credited to his
education. His views measure up to
those of the average educated man
who has leanings toward state social-
ism, free trade and a. disarmament
policy. He is the typical example of
the American whose politics are de-
scribed as liberal. But aside from his
background in social questions as a
determiner of policy, there are the
present circumstances. There are not
many choices for a government now.
Rugged individualism is washed out
as an ideal. And with it have gone
others ballyhooed and practiced be-
fore it became apparent that pros-
perity was not just around the corner.

For the most part I believe that
this reaction is a healthy sign. I
doubt that Roosevelt and his men
will go far enough in their reversal
of government policies. But a little
of the right stuﬁ, it seems to me, is
a. whole lot better than none at all.
Disarmament Possibilities

It is believed in Washington that
the MacDonald conversations of last
week will produce a badly needed
disarmament plan. That is certainly
good news, however much we may
question its results. Disarmament
has been the stumbling block for too
many sincere statesmen to allow any
glib belief in its results. In this
world of national hates and imperial-
ism, no one is going to accept blind-
folded an agreement full of possible
dynamite.

But that is hardly an excuse for
giving up peace as a. bad job. I am

that we can have peace under capi-
talism as it operates now. It may be
possible to educate people for peace.
It is certainly worth trying.

On the Pitt campus this week there
is being conducted a. poll to deter-
mine student attitude on war. This
movement to bring undergraduate
opinions to the attention of the pub-
he began at Brown University as an
American variety of the opinion
shown at Oxford in the famous vote
of the Oxford Union some months
back. The leaders expect to ﬁnd that
the American student, is a red hot
paciﬁst. And I think that they will
not be disappointed.

Students Change Some

American undergraduates have
changed a little of late. They have
not, of course, become- the social-
minded individuals that we would like
to have them. But they have at least
thrown off the bone-head personali-
ties that made their elders despair
in past years. Something has hap-
pened. Whereas ﬁve years back
about one per cent of them knew or
cared anything about social questions
such as peace, we have now a; larger
number. There still are. an unholy
number of boys and girls whose
greatest intellectual effort is devoted
to the election of the fraternity coal-
ition to some absurd office in student
council. But it is hopeful to note that
a few have developed interests out-
side the cloistered atmosphere of the
university.

A student vote on war at present
will produce a general front diﬂerent
from what might have been produced
had such a poll been conducted ten
years back. The ﬂood of anti-war
propaganda has been immense. And
college students, exposed more or
less to a brain-stimulant climate,
have taken in more than their share.
Anyone can learn to repeat phrases.
By some means college men and wo-
men have learned to say, “War is a
bad thing.” Naturally they have little
idea of what it means. And in a
time of a propaganda ﬂood from the
pro-war camp. their surface ideas
would change rapidly enough.

To Gauge Student
War Attitude In
Poll This Week

A poll on student participation in
war, proposed to 600 colleges through-
out the United States by the Brown
University Daily Herald, begins on
the Pitt campus today and will con-
tinue until Friday.

Under the auspices of the war poll
committee, headed by William Ed-
wards, Col. ’33, of the Student Branch,
League for Social Justice, the ques-
tionnaire will embrace all phases of
the war participation question. Sally
Dunmire, Ed. '33, Dagney Ollsen,
Col. ’33, and John Tibby, Col. '34,
committee members, will be stationed
at the Cathedral of Learning, at
Alumni Hall, and at State Hall to get
student signatures.

Four questions are asked on the
ballot. The ﬁrst ‘states that the
signer will not participate in any
war engaged in by the United States
for any purpose. The second allows
entrance only “if the shores of the
United States are invaded.” Those
f3-V0I‘iI1g the present system, partici-
pation in any war decreed by the
President and Congress, will sign the
third ,-question, and students opposed
only to “imperialism wars” will
answer to the "fourth query.

camp, folder outlining religious oppor-
tunities, banquet for all fraternity
pledges, four freshman clubs, pre-med
club, dental forums, inter-club act1v-
ities, co-operation with other activ-
ities, series of religious forums in all
fraternity houses, “Know-Pitt”: cam-
paign to break down impersonal nature
of social life. ’ ‘ 

Harold -Mahoney, James Moore,
Co1_ '34, and James Montgomery,
Eng. '35, will conduct all projects
“emphasizing tangible service to stu-
dents,” such as the freshman hand-
book, YM-YWCA parties. games
(checkers, chess, billiards, ping-
pong, intramural sports) lobby
programs, student relief, and Y hut
-facilities such as magazines and
study rooms. »

Activities emplhasizing faculty-stu-
dent relations will be headed bY-.
King Derr and Jim Eichelberger,
Eng.,’35. Plans for the coming year
include‘ student groups in faculty
homes, faculty-student retreats, fac-
ulty-student studies, promotion of in-
formal contacts, and vocational in-
formation conferences. Derr will
also lead “projects implying cooper-
ation with non-campus agencies.” In-
tercollegiate Conferences at Eagles-
mere and Bethany, intercollegiate re-
lations, and relations with other or-
ganizations, such as the League for
Social Justice, are listed on his pro-
gram.

tional Relations Club, ‘I-Luman Rela-
tions Trips, World Education Insti-
