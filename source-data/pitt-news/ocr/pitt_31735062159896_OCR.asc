By HARRIET PINCUS

Although Europe is no long-
er the gay- continent, of old,
it’s still a fascinating place in
which to spend a summer.

This is the opinion of Demas

Barnes, associate professor of
history, who travelled last sum-‘
mer in Belgium, West Germany,
and Austria.
‘ Leaving July 3 by ship from
Boston, Dr. Barnes and his wife
landed in Liverpool, England, and
from there began their tour of the
continent.

The tremendous amount of war
destruction in Germany impressed

: the history professor although he
‘ found economic’ conditions‘ there
better than in England. Although
much has not yet been rebuilt, the
Germans as a whole are a happy
people. ‘
- ’ Berlin Worried
- Berliners, however, are worried
about how they can go on Without
their city being. reunited. Dr.
Barnes commented on the striking
difference in conditions between
East and West Berlin.
In Vienna, the tension is‘not so
great as in Berlin, but it is no

Lecturer Terms Arts A Source

Of Stability To Mechanized US

“The arts are today one resource that can help bring
stability to an America launched into World responsibilities,”
was the keynote of the season’s ﬁrst lecture in the Pitcairn-
Crabbe series given last Tuesday in the Stephen Foster

' Memorial.

The lecture, titled “For the Sta-
bility of the State,” was deliver-
ed by Dr. Philip Rhys Adams, di-
rector _of the Cincinnati Art Mu-
seum, Art Academy of Cincinnati,
and Taft Museum.

Dr. Ad ams explained that
through the arts the -modern
American can acquire a sense of
the history and the personality of
the peoples with whom he is now
involved in world aﬁairs in the
shortest possible time.

Another reason for the import-
ance of the arts is that through
them mechanized man can regain
the aesthetic faculty necessary to
his stability. *

ple among whom we travelled,”
said Dr. Barnes, ‘-‘and the desire
expressed by so many to come to
the United States.”
Lucky Break
One of the luckiest experiences

of the Barnes’ trip occurred in
Vienna, when they applied to the
American consulate for permission
to go south through the British
zone to the Alpine town of Styria.

Since all siich requests are
checked by the Russian command-
ant in Vienna, a three-day wait
was required. At the end of the
three days, the Barneses learned
that‘ of 11 requests ﬁled, theirs was
the only one accepted.

Dr. Barnes still can’t ﬁgure out
why they were the lucky ones.

As to his opinions on the Euro-
pean situation in. general, Dr.
Barnes says, -“Observations ‘in-
creased our belief that one of the
best methods for advancing inter-
national understanding, and there-
foreworld peace, would be the in-
terchange, of, students between
American and European universi-
ties.”

' High ‘school football in western Pennsylvania is just

Approximately 15 schools are anxiously? awaiting the
gﬁnal tabulations of the Gardner point systenr to ﬁnd out
just who among the undefeated school-boy elevens will
clash for the, western Pennsylvania championships. \
And also about this time of the year coaches, writers,

 

busily working on an A11-WPIAL
football team for each of the four
classes-—AA, A, B, and C. '

Konek’s Starring

 

teresting. All the boys are prod-

ucts of western Pennsylvania.

They are the cream of the crop.

The best that this district can pro-

duce.

V It’s ' always interesting to
check these names with the Pitt
football roster _ the following
September. There is no reason
in the world why any of these

‘ boys should migrate _to the Mid-
west or South unless it be poor
high school scholastic standing.

 Boys like Ed Modzelewski of

 - / Har-Brack and now of Maryland

*4 ' and John Konek of California, Pa.
and now of'Kansas, had practically
come up to the doorsteps of Pitt

a few years back but right now

> they’re showing their wares else-
where. ~

“Big M0’ is being boomed as All-

'American material this year—his

- last at Maryland. Konek is lead-

‘ing the Missouri vValley Confer-
ence in scoring with 42 points.
Pitt Must Follow Lead
‘ Against Michigan State the Pan-
thers picked up less than 100 yards
through State’s strong defense.

_.State’s defensive line was compos-

-ed of seven seniors who had work-
ed as a unit for three years. _

Wouldn’t it be ideal if the Pitts
had such an array to throw
against the gridiron powers in
future seasons? And it’s not i_m-
possible either.

” Schools like Ohio State, Michi-

  

 

.gan State, Notre Dame and many‘

1 others have groups that contact
‘football material and induce this
material to go to their school. Pitt
could and must, if it is to survive,
do the same.

Panthers a Winner
Imagine Pitt with 11 A11-WPIAL
players ggacing the starting lineup.

3

Sounds good, doesn’t it?

If someone or some group here
at Pitt would contact these boys
before the invading hordes track
them down, Pitt would get some
of this talent._

_ There’s nothing more that \I
would enjoy than coming back to
the university in a few years and
see winning football being played
by Pitt.

Spartans Loaded

It made me heartsick to read in

officials, and WPIAL heads d.I.c¢'

1 This All-Star team is always in-

~ to come.

 

the Detroit‘ papers comparing Pitt
to Michigan State. The writer
listed Pitt as a gridiron nobody
and State as a gridiron power.
Just a few years ago this was
just the reverse. We all know
why State is a power. The Spar-
tans raided Pennsylvania for
talent a few years ago and it
‘produced. I would like to see
these Pennsylvania bo ys in -
Pennsylvania and it can be done.
In Munhall, a ball club that has
just completed its ﬁrst unde-
feated football campaign, there.
is a boy who is undoubtedly the
best high school halfback I have
ever seen.

A Must For Pitt

His name is Billy Kane and his.
brother Joe is now playing for the
Frosh-.TV outﬁt. Young Bill, a
185-pound dynamo, scored . 12
touchdowns in eight games this
year. He’s fast, very elusive, and
is a specialist on diagnosing ene-
my’s plays. He is also a smart lad
in school work and as yet is un-
decided on what college he will
attend. He is deﬁnitely interested
in furthering his education.

This is an example of talent that
just can’t miss in college ranks‘,
and there’s no reason why it can’t
come to Pitt.

Boys like Lou Cimarolli, Hen-
ry, Ford, Dick Dietrick, and Bob
Epps are examples of this kind
of talent that is already on the
Pitt squad. In two years these
fellows will be the veterans, and
backed by the best western

‘Pennsylvania high schools can
produce the Panthers should
have winning seasons for years

There is nothing wrong with the
talent on this year’s football squad,
but when you ‘play big league
football which future Pitt sched-
ules propose you must have all-

   In Cool, Cool,

Neither icy winds, wet groundsﬁ

nor the Phi Gains could stop the
Phi Kaps from skidding their way
to a 25-12 victory Wednesday af-
ternoon. The bitter cold kept the
boys hopping throughout 40 min:
utes of fast football on a slip-
pery Schenley Oval turf.

Phi__Kappa grabbed a 6-0 lead
on the ﬁrst series of plays, and
from that point on were never
headed. Dick Struthers connect-
edyon the ﬁrst of his two touch-
down passes as Joe Bendle made
the catch in_the end zone.

The Phi Gams_' ‘bounced right‘

back to score on -a 40-yard toss
from Joe Porter to Joel Kerr, and
the - score remained deadlocked

through halftime. ‘ ‘ e

checked when Joe Rufﬁng inter-
cepted Porter’_s pass in the end
zone. Seconds later Ruﬂing hauled
in a 40-yard Struthers aerial for
the second Phi Kappa TD.

. 60-Yard TD Pass

Early in the fourth period the

wind swept a‘ Phi Gamma punt

out of bounds on their own 20-
yard line, from where, on the ﬁrst
play from sqrimmage, Struthers
raced into the end zone to make
the score, 18-6.

The Phi Gams shook out the ice
cubes _and cut the lead to 18-12
when Curt Snodgras, heaved the
longest pass of the day—60 yards

‘40-yard pass in the end zone for
the touchdown and a Struthers-

the scoring at 25-12. '

Faculty Keeps in Shape

By Playing

The Pitt faculty has always
been a distinguished group, but
for the past 12 years they have
especially emphasized just how
much on the ball they really are.

Every Friday afternoon, from 4
to 6 p.m. at the Cathedral gym, an
a s s ortment of
educators from
such ﬁelds as
chemistry, poli-
t i c a 1 science,
economics a n d
education, g e t
together for. a
s n a p p y t w 0
hours of volley-

 

ball.

Since 1939,
when Pitt li-
brarian Dr. A.

L. Robinson ﬁrst suggested the
idea, these sports—minded players
have been relaxing and exercising
together in an entirely informal
series of games. ;

The “manager” of the weekly
volleyball session is Foster Hall
Curator Fletcher Hodges, whose
duties consist of “merely turning
lights on and off, getting out the
net and balls, and picking up wet
towels afterward.”

While getting into the spirit of
the game, the_ instructors play
with all the vigor volleyball re-

quires, but the most serious acci-
dent anyone has encountered was
when one prof had his glasses
knocked off and broken.

All Pitt students who want to
watch their profs go to it are in-
vited to attend a game any Friday
afternoon. ’

Perhaps if he cheers for his
teacher loud enough, he may pass
his course after all.
