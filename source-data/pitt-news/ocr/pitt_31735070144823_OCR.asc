Students enter ROTC amid wartime

by Richard Rosengarten
Staﬂ Wrifer

On the six—year anniversary
of the Iraq war last week, some
held vigil's to remember the dead.
Others attended protests against
U.S. military presence abroad. For
many, this has been a time to re-
ﬁect. p

Meanwhile the ROTC’s Three

Rivers Battalion, formerly the’

Panther Battalion, was on the Car-
negie Mellon track field at 6 a.m.
It was a- foggy, windless, cold
Friday _morning,, and the three
cadets who arrived at 6:05 were
too late to join a four—mile run
through Schenley Park with the
rest of the battalion for their Or-

ganizational Day.

  Pitt groups lobby

There’s a new aspect to education
that’s become quite  to univer-

students, alumni -and University ad-

Pitt has revamped its lobbying ef-

which will distnbute hundreds of bil-

an effort to revive the economy.

County orders Oakland boiler; plant‘ to cut ‘emissions

- Belleﬁeld Boiler Plant is helping
Pittsburgh clean up its reputation
as the second dirtiest city in the
United States. ‘ '

The Allegheny County Health
Department issued a consent order
agreement to Belleﬁeld Boiler Plant
last month ordering the factory
to cut back on emissions by July
1. Oakland residents will breathe
cleaner air and get some soot off
their property.

As a result of the fuel conver¥
sion, sulfur oxide emissions will

be cut by 99 percent, or 700 tons a .
year, and particulate emissions will

be cut by 76 percent, or 170' tons a
year, a county news release said.

Belleﬁeld Boiler Plant, located

in Junction Hollow behind the
Carnegieilnstitute, supplies steam
for heating the universities, hos-
pitals, museums

also be a great relief to the people
that live in the Hollow.”

administration, lobbyists wrote policies, caused
wasteful spending and contiibuted to govern-
ment secrecy. , ,

His rhetoric resonated with many people
— including college students —— who wanted

‘the comfort of ethics reform during the next

presidency, with more monitoring of lobbying
laws. On 21, Obama signed an executive or-
der that included provisions to restrict lobbyists’
employment at the \White House and prevent
administration officials from accepting lobbyist

gifts.

But many Pitt students may not realize they ,

support lobbying simply by being a Pitt student
University administrators, SGB and independent
student groups work to inﬂuence elected ofﬁcials

at the federal, state and local level. -

Colleges and universities represent one of the
most inﬂuential lobbying industries in 
ton. The education industry is the sixth most in—
ﬂuential sector that gives money to members of
Congress, according to the Center for Respon-
sive Politics

Educators spent $36.5 billion  money
to members of Congress in 2008- 88 percent
of which was given to Democrats, according tn

the group.

Pitt is a member of the Association of Amer-
ican Universities and the Association of Public
and Land Grant Universities, two federal organi-
zations of colleges and universities that work to
lobby Congress. The AAU advocates on behalf
of large research institutions, while the APLU
advocates for state school systems.

Pitt often lobbies Congress for  from
the National Institute of Health and the Nation-
al Science Foundation, which grant researchers
 for projects. ' —

Jeanne Stoner, assistant vice chancellor for

federal governmental relations, said Pitt has also
lobbied against legislation that would restrict the
use of “class B” laboratory animals — animals
that are notneoessatily bred for research pur-

poses. Pitt has also lobbied Congress in favor of  P
legislation that would publish taxpayer—funded 

research projectsfrom the National Institute of
Health.

“For the past 10 years, the need for of-

lﬁce space has remained generally strong,” he

said. “It’s not slowing down like the rest of

the economy, because universities continue

to grow and do research.”

As far as the idea for a new hotel in
Oakland, Sukernek thinks it’s a “super idea”
because it will be convenient for those visit-

-ing Carnegie Mellon, Pitt or Carlow Uni-

versity. ,
“We are pretty confident that there will
be a market for this hotel,” said Frank Gus—

the universities around, parents come and
visit, and as of now, they’re -usually sent

what he had hoped for,” said Gustine, but
we expect that everything will still go as
planned.

Among the Oakland developers is
Elmhu_rst Group, located Downtown, which
plans to build a first—class ofﬁce building
next to Ruskin Hall on Bayard Street.

“There’s very little vacancy in Oakland
right now, and we feel that there is still a
demand for office space,” said Bill Hunt,
the president of the Elmhurst Group. “We
don’t know who the tenants will be yet, but
with the universities and hospitals nearby,
we are confident we’ll have tenants.

“Ideally we’d like to have one tenant,” he
said, “but we know we may have more, be-
cause thebuilding will be relatively large.”

The building will be seven—stories tall
with a parking garage underneath. Hunt

ing events every week. You can’t
get this sort of experience any-
where else.”

| While the cadets are excited
to advance in the service, many
veterans, like Christian Shields,
a former petty Naval officer, en-
ginernan and Pitt student, adopt a

new set of ‘concerns if they return
to school after serving. .
Down in Pitt’s Veterans Ser-
vices Office, an office tucked
neatly in Thackeray Hall’s ground
floor, veterans deal with a school

bureaucracy familiar to most stu-'

dents, but made more complicat-
ed by their service.

Nick Bloom, a worker for the .

office and Navy veteran, having
served nine yearson the subma-
rine U.S.S. Florida, said it’s‘ like a
dueling bureaucracy, coming from
one into the other. It’s not easy to
go right back into the school sys-

tem. He said it'would be nice for 0

a refresher course in how things
work, ,

“You kind -of get thrown in
just like everyone else,” he said.
“The ROTC are more gung—ho.

‘There’s a big difference between

the ROTC_ and people who have

served.”

Pitt veterans pursue degrees
Veterans come to the office con-
stantly to get their tuition payments

in’ order and to try to get credits
earned in the service transferred.

 Advanced Education,
a journal for service members,
runs a list of the top 30 military-
friendly colleges in the United
States. They are selected based on
the number of military students,

' availability of financial aid, the

number of  contracts and

' more.

Pitt did not make the list of
schools that “bend over backward
to offer additional support and

‘ consideration to members of the

military and their families,” though
Duquense University’s School of
Leadership did.

Bloom said Pitt’s Veterans
Services Office is for tuition and
credit considerations and little
else. Some veterans tried to start
a group a while back so veterans
could meet socially on a regular
basis, but it never came together.

“Administrators come down
all the time and ask us -what could
be done better,” he said. i

Pitt veterans receive benefits

with the Veterans Hospital and
the financial aid will be ‘consid-

erably better under the new (3.1. .

Bill. Before, veterans received tu-
ition money and had to pay their
bills to the school they attend. The
money goes directly to the school
under the new bill. ‘
Shields, Mehalic, Pritchard,
Bloom and Nathan Mcneil ex-

.Shields served in Japan and

i helped. with the 2005 tsunami re-

lief effoit in Thailand. He_said that

i the great humanitarian work the

United States does helps provide
safety and stability in the world.

Shields is working toward a de-
gree in education. He would like
one day to be an educator for chil-
dren with special needs.

He is of a community of stu-
dents involved with the Armed
Forces, whether they are excited

that the space will be used as doctors’ or

Its architecture will match Ruskin Hall

. FWG Realty also plans to develop in Oak-
land near Forbes, Craft and Fifth avenues; '

“We have our hands on six of eight acres

' at the site,” said Gustine. “We are still in

thelplanning stages but have talked about
having medical buildings, office space and
an amphitheater.”

The project will cost upward of $150 mil-
lion and will sit on top of a parking garage
that the group also plans to build.

As far as the University. goes, Pitt has no
problem with the inﬂux of development.

“Any development that enhances the
quality of the educational experience for
our students and improves the quality of
life in Oakland is a welcome development,”
said Pitt spokesman John Fedele.

many of the items on the survey were 5
almost trivially small — remembering P

Not many people can honestly
°say that  off the lights or not ’

The State of Culture

_ "The April movie season is go-
ing to be extraordinary. “Fast and
Furious” comes out April 3, and
“Crank  High Voltage” is sched-

. uled to be released-on April 17,

presumably to give viewers time to

‘recover and clean up from Vin Die-

sel and Co.,'loosing the floodgates
of testosterone on them two weeks
earlier. Relationships will be tested

 — “Why, you needy Wench? Because

I’m a man_ and you dragged me to

Seats will become warm with giddy
boy-dom, and wrists will weaken
from excessive ﬁst pumping.

In the middle of doing push-

 ups to get ready, I started to hate

of these 'franchises. The critical
community has found itself hung
as to whether it should condemn
Diesel and Statham’s silver-screen
offerings or praise them for their
“delightful post—modern sensibili-

ties of pastiche and meta-ﬁlm and .
whatnot.” In general, reading about

or discussing these movies has all

the appeal of talking about how

_ iPpds affect culture or how down-

loading music realizes Marx’s ideal
of commerce. _

At first, one would supposethat
the philosophical supporters of
“Crank” are the opposites of its
detractors. In fact, however, they
are of one accord. Both responses
are ones of fear. V

They demand these films be {it
into safecategories: either thesis
or cultural lowpoint. Over-think-

films allowed to simply exist, we
risk accepting them as part of the
norm. The horror.

The problem  both of these

‘enterprises is that we have been

taught that we cannot simply" enjoy
things. Suffering under the Aristo-
telian delusion that our impulses
are either animal and instinctive
or human and rational, we are
frightened by products that appeal
to our senses -but not our intelli-
gence. Wanting to be human and
not a dirty animal, we are scared of

' things we like without having a well
- thought-out explanation.

' It’s as if we  have a small
Freud sitting .on our‘ shoulders
whispering, ‘‘If you don’t know
why, it might be becauseyou want
to bed your mother, you are scared ‘
of losing your penis and you ‘are
gay.” If we do have an explanation
for some inclination - either, “I‘
like it because it exempliﬁes the
prevalent strains of contemporary
thinking” or, "‘I hate it because it
is ﬁlth that corrupts the youth and

‘ lowers our standards” — then we

are sure of our bearings. There
is no chance our strings are being
pulled by some little demon.

Psych classes laugh at the idea
of using Freudian psychoanalysis

_ Staﬂ Wrder

On the ninth floor of the WH-
liam Pitt Union, Annabelle Clip-
pinger and the Pitt Arts ofﬁce have
aligned their powers in pursuit of
two goals: get students interested
in art, and then make it avail:
able for as ‘little cost as possible.

 in many cases it’s free.

While some programs take stu—-

dents to a theatrical or musical event,
complete with artist meet—and—greets,
other programs allow students to ex-
plore ,on their own time.-That’s why
it’s free to enter Oakland’s Carnegie
Art and Natural History Museums
and Phipps Conservatory, as well
as the North Shore’s War-
hol Museum and Mattress
Factory — all with just your
Pitt ID. "

.“People can go as it ﬁts
their schedule,” says Clip-
pinger, director of the Pitt
Arts program‘. “Students
0 can sayg ‘Hey, it’s a stressful
week, I can go between 10
and 11. I think I’ll check out
the new dino exhibit, or I’ll
check out the holiday ﬂow_er
exhibit.”’ A

And students go. Accord-
ing to a survey conducted by
Pitt Arts, in the last ﬁnancial
year, 18,768 students went
-- to themuseums. Of those
students, 94 percent have
gone only once during the
year. At Pitt, art is a clear

part of students’
make up.

The Univer-
sity community’s
opportunity for
cultural activity
is ﬁnally matched
with the ﬁnan-
cial resources to
be successful.
Every visit to a
museum, costs
the University
an undisclosed
amount. .

But the Uni-
versity pays
nearly $130,000
for admission “7
to the museums,
reports Pitt Arts
— and that ﬁg-
ure doesn’t even include the Cheap
Seats program, where the University
subsidizes ticket prices and the pro—
grams that include dinner and an art
event. Students have an incredible
opportunity to get involved in art.

“According to our data, roughly

' 6 percent of all visitors are between

the ages of 19 and 24. In the re-

gion itself, roughly 6 percent of the _
_ population is 19 to 24 years old.

That says that more young adults
are taking advantage of the muse-
ums than the conventional wisdom,”

~ said  marketing director

for Carnegie Museums of Art and
Natural History. '

-_ Through Pitt Arts, students have

the opportunity to develop relation-

intertwine students who often see

‘ college as a temporary situation

with institutions of unique artistic

expression.

The Moz ’s latest

Twenty—one

 But now he 
:'back and  electric style to the
;masses—again. , _ ’

. Years of RefusalisMortissey’s ninth
studio album. His vocal style remains
 — backedby strings and

‘ clann' ets when he’s feeling sentimental

and a constant electric haze of 
when he’s breathing. -

The album comes at the height of
a resurgence of rock icons from the
recent past turned reinvented solo acts

for a new generation of fans Earlylast 5

month, David Byrne of The Talking

Heads made an appearance on “The .

Colbert Report” to promote his latest

release and to snatch up the coveted

“Colbert bump” , ‘

When a‘musician’s reached the 

ﬁddled around with  his own
solo style and perfected his craft before
you were even born, it’s pretty obvi-
ous that he’s not citing Ok Go as 

main inﬂuence These works take on 

an individualist ﬂair,  toward the
obscure— simultaneously experimental
and sentimental. The music becomes a
 of the artist’s own won:
rather than some regurgitated tribute
to days‘ gone by. - ‘
Wth Morrissey, whether it’s romance,
heartbreak or grief, it’s all 
riffs, fog machines and pyrotechnics —
and that’s the  It brings backthat

sound without  too hard, and while
the connection to the past is unrnistak—
able, it’s not the essence of Morrissey.
It’s the show that he brings to the
forefront with just his vocals or a care-

Morrissey invokes more theatrical

tones with “Ifs Not Your Birthday

Anymore” The tracks reminiscent of

' Depeche Mode, ala Songs of Faith and

Devotions ‘just One Caress” It’s got
the vocal range of some dark, Disney
mirror-image ballad. Fuzzy fedings don’t
accompany those clarinet notes. It’s more
of a  realism poured out of a
wounded heart.

Similarly, “You Were Good InYour

Time” comes off slow and steady with
its strings and soft brush of percussion. ’

But at around 3:25,  getweird, and
the melancholy musical number fades
into monk-like

comes a post—apocalyptic French night-

In the ieng term, it isn’t looks that

A If it did, Morrissey would be in
trouble because lately he favors button
downs with tuxedo rufﬂes over the cur-
rent rock fashion trends ,
This guy can throw his arms out

or two from Mr. Morrissey.

' like he’s in "The Sound of Music”with

pugs  around his feet and still

tambourine if he is so inclined.

The inconveniences of listening
to the ‘music of ' now—defunct bands
emerge after only one minute You like
The Smiths? Sorry, but the band broke  
up in 1987.

If you want to hear its tunes, you’re
stuck with your deluxe, remastered edi-
tion of The Sound of the Smiths But

Carnegie Museums, sees benefit from these
relationships.

“The more you can engage students in -
Pittsburgh, theigreater the likelihood is that.

they will stay here,” she said.

Already the arts community has found a
friend in Pitt Arts. An unpublished survey
conducted by the University shows that 86
percent of students would patronize the art
after college. ’

In an ever-failing economy, arts institutions
are every bit in need of stable ﬁnancing as
other industries. Developing long—term re-
lationships with students might be a way to
ensure a future full of art.

'According to data collected by the National
Academy of Arts, those people who are edu-
cated about art are more likely to patronize the
arts later on in life.

“The more education, we develop, the

higher amounts of arts and culture participa— A

tion. In our arsenal of weapons to increase

participation is our partnerships with the uni?

versities,” said Julian.

One such program is through Pitt’s medi-
cal school and the Warhol Museum, which is
designed to, according to a statement from the

Carnegie museums, “hone visual thinking and
observation skills through the study of art in
the museums’ galleries.“ Another program
pairs curators and medical students together
to understand the history of medicine from a
much broader perspective. In addition to the
Pitt programs, Carnegie Mellon has developed
relationships with the museums, as well.

The wide scope of the Pitt Arts community
shows just how much the student population
supports the arts. According to Pitt Arts, Just
31 percent of Pitt'Arts attendees are humani-
ties majors. In fact, many of students are in-
volved in the sciences and engineering.

The benefit for Pitt students can be seen in

_ the overwhelming amount of support for Pitt

Arts. When new students first encounter the
Pitt community, they often find themselves at
a table full of Pitt Arts information.

Parents  students alike are excited for

free tickets to incredible shows like"‘Life at

Mars” or the chance to sit underneath metallic

- clouds at the Warhol Museum.

“Emotional connectsf: said Julian, “like
those you get from artistic experiences, and
what that does for your soul is as important
as anything else, if not more so.”

a reunion and the notion that Billy‘ Corgan is
batshit insane. ‘ I '

In2005, the dude took outa full-page adin the

him. It worked, sort of, but the ‘resulting album
Zeigeirz‘ (featuring only Corgan and Chamberlin)
was anything but, and the band began a freefall
into irrelevance. ' _

Corgan’s statement that The Pumpkins would
only release singles, not albums, because, ‘ ‘People
don’t even listen to it all” made him sound like a
bitchy child. Maybe people just didn’t listen to all
of your record, Billy.
