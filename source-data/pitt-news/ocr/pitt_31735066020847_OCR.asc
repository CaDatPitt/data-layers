‘Pollock will not seek council re-election

_By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh City Councilman
Mark H. Pollock announced that
he will not seek re-election after
his term ends in 1990 at a news
conference yesterday.

”I am today‘ announcing that I
will not seek another term on'City
Council,” Pollock said. ”I have
no desire to serve on this legisla-

.g_k.tive body.”

Pollock blamed the political -
process for his decision, adding
that too many politicians com-
promise their principles. He re-
fused to name specific politicians.

”On contested votes, I was fre-
quently the lone dissenter voter

in a very small minority,” Pollock-
said. ’’I havelearned that my
idealism and rigid ethics do not
work in a ‘go along, get along’
political system.”

He also ‘denied that health
problems had influenced his de-
cision not to run, adding, ”My

"health ‘has never been better.”

Pollock suffered from an eating
disorder earlier in his term.

”The thought of being on the
council until 1994, after how
difficult it has been, made me de-
cide this isn't what I want;”

Pollock declined to endorse
anyone to replace him in his seat,
which represents the Oakland,
Bloomfield, -Shady_side'and Squir-
rel Hill areas.

When asked of his future plans,
Pollock joked that he was ”think—
ing very seriously ofgrunning for
governor of Massachusetts,”
referring to Governor Michael
Dukakis’ recent decision not t
seek re—eIection. ‘

Pollock would not specify what
he plans on doing in the future
but said he was investigating his
options. He added that public
service was not out of the ques-
tion, but would not elaborate any
further.’ .

He also-said that he would no
be a ’’lame duck,” and that he
would continue to fight for his
legislation.

”My term does not end until
January, 1990, and "I intend to be

extremely active this year,” he
said. ’’I have several significant
pieces of legislation that will be
introduced and some major ini-
tiatives that will be undertaken.”

Pollock listed the Smoking Or-
dinance, the Historic Preserva-
tion Ordinance, the Anti-Graffiti
legislation and the Crimestoppers
Reward Program as major accom-
plishments of his term.

’’I also include the Gay Rights
Ordinance among my victories.
Although the bill's passage was
denied by a 4-4 vote, there is no
doubt that this important legisla-
tion will pass in the very near fu-
ture. The work has been done,
the battle" won,” he added. .

Pa. man sentenced to death for police slaying

 EASTON, Pa. (AP) ~ A North-
ampton County ‘jury ordered the
death penalty yesterday for
Samuel Lee Green, who was con-
. victed of kidnapping and killing,
a Harrisburg police officer.

The jury of six men and six
women returned its decision on _
the penalty for Green after more

than two hours of deliberation
yesterday. Green was convicted

 late Monday of first-degree mur- "

First Assistant District Attorney
Mark Refowich, who argued for
the death penalty, said he was
pleased. .

’’It was a statement by th
jurors of this county that they are
sick and tired of this kind of
senseless killing,” he said._ A‘

On Monday, jurors deliberated
for over four hours before con-
victing the 33-year-old Harrisburg
resident in the death of the

' S47-year-old officer. ’

ing to health educator Shirley
Haberman.

”This is a very beneficial
service. We hope to enhance
the well-being of students so

they can ‘perform well while .

they are here [at Pitt],” said
Haberman, who has been in-
volved with the annual event
for the past five years.

Featured at the fair will be
free health screening tests, in-
cluding cholesterol, body fat

Police follow new leads after Bundy execution

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Police
are investigating murders that oc-
curred when Ted Bundy, the seri-
al killer who died in Florida's
electric chair Tuesday, was at-
tending Temple University in
1969.

On Tuesday, officers said they
have yet to link him to any
deaths. A

Bundy, who confessed shortly
before his execution to killing 20
young women, attended Temple
University during the spring
semester, from January to May,
20 years ago.

The 42-year-old law school
dropout told forensic psycholo-
gist Art Norman that he began his
serial murders several years earli-
er than originally thought. He
said he killed two women in the
Philadelphia area.

Norman, who worked on Bun-

dy’s appeals at Florida State Pri-
son in 1986 and 1987, said the
serial killer told him that the
murders occurred around the
time he was attending Temple.
Norman would not reveal
where Bundy said the women
were killed, or other details about

the murders.

”We are looking into it, but we
have not found anything,” said
detective Walter Campbell, of the
Phildelphia police’s homicide
unit, on Tuesday of the reported
murders. ”We’ll look at the peri-
od he was here.”

Casey calls for new
life in war on drugs

HARRISBURG (AP) —. Gov.
Robert P. Casey, claiming a
record of ”historic accomplish-
ments and promises fulfilled,”
called on lawmakers Tuesday to
expand the war on drugs, along
with other reforms.

Reviving a tradition that was in-
terrupted 14 years ago, Casey
delivered a 31-minute State of the
Commonwealth address to a joint
session of the Legislature.

Without using a specific figure,
Casey said he wants more done
to fight drug abuse, which he
called a cancer that over-
shadowed good economic news
and other gains made in his first

two years in office.

Tipping his hand in a preview
of his budget proposal in two
weeks, the governor said he
would call on the General As-
sembly to give more money and
more staff to the attorney gener-
al and state police to fight what
he called ”the single most des-
tructive problem  in our com-
monwealth.” -

Unusual weather to
blame for air-quality

PITTSBURGH (AP) — An un-

usual January temperature inver- .

sion is being blamed for
unhealthy air-quality readings at
monitoring -stations throughout
Allegheny County, officials said.

A health advisory was in effect
Tuesday for people with heart or
respiratory ailments who live in
Avalon, Liberty and the Pitts-
burgh neighborhoods of Hazel-

wood and Oakland.

In Oakland, 10 to 12 people
were treated at Presbyterian-
Hospital Monday for shortness of
breath and asthma problems, ”a
lot for an eight-hour period,” said
emergency room nurse Beth
Pfeffer.

Giraffe birth hoped
for in March 1990

(AP) — Officials at the Pitts-
burgh Zoo are hoping for a suc-
cessful giraffe birth next year,
following the stillbirth of a sec-
ond calf there in less than five
months.

Denny Maxim said the zoo’s
two female giraffes may have
been too small to bear young,
leading to stillbirths in September
and this month. He said that as
a giraffe grows, its bone structure
expands and birth becomes less
difficult.

Terri, a 5-year-old giraffe, was
unable to deliver a 150-pound
male on Jan. 13. The calf was too
large and became lodged in the
mother's birth canal.

Culture,

”Geneva is so boring,” Jean-
Marc said, kicking a small stone
on the road.

Standing above one of Switzer-
land's most beautiful cities, we

watched as the stone tumbled

down the hill.

_ I couldn't imagine Geneva, the
peace capital of the world, with
its embassies, international diver-
sity and culture, as boring. There
just seemed to be too much go-
ing on to make the city dull.

On my first day in Geneva,
Jean—Marc, a friend who had in-
vited me to visit his home, ac-
companied me on a walk aroun
the city. ‘

We toured his '”neighbor-'

hood,” a collection of high-rise
condominium complexes which
he described as ”middle-cIass.”
The lawns were neatly
trimmed, the parking lot litter-
free, and the trees carefully
pruned. Each complex even had
a small, square section fenced off
so people could walk their dogs
without ruining the rest of the
grass. '
The entire city of Geneva —
even the embassies — seemed
covered by a layer of invisible
Teflon.
' Later in the evening, Jean-Marc
suggested "going out to one of his
old hangouts.
. I immediately agreed, realizing
that I was lonely. I felt as if I

hadn't seen another person, ex-
cept for Jean-Marc, since I had
arrived.

The few people I had passed
while walking around the city
seemed quiet and withdrawn. If
I smiled and nodded ”heI|o,”
they just looked surprised, then

clean, "white sidewalk.

I figured Jean-Marc's hangout
promised to be a place where I_
could find ’’real’’ people.

When we first arrived at the
club, I was stunned when the
doorman, dressed in a tailored
suit, asked Jean—Marc for his
membership card.

I realized this wouldn't be the
casual evening I had expected.

Upon entering, we descended
a long, red-carpeted staircase into
a room filled with cigarette

smoke and people who looked to .

be in their mid-20s.
Some of the walls were co-

vered with mirrors flashing reflec-
tions of the gold—painted pillars
interspersed throughout the
room. Other walls were covered
with burgundy velvet.

As I stepped down into the
room, a Tom Cruise |ook—a|ike
standing with a group of loud,
|eather—jacketed marines,
bumped into me, spilling his beer
onto my shoes.

”Oh well,” he said, laughing
and turning back to his friends.

For a moment, I stood staring
at him, waiting for an apology.
Jean-Marc gently pushed me
toward the bar.

”Most of the marines at this-
place don't really care about a
woman unless she wears a fur
coat,” he whispered.

I smiled, suddenly not regret-
ting only wearing jeans, a sweat-
er and a windbreaker.

When we arrived at the bar, I
told Jean—Marc I would buy the
first round of beer.

”You don't want to do that,” he
advised. ”It’s probably about six
dollars a bottle.”

I insisted and then ordered a

beer for Jean—Marc and a glass of
water for myself.

All around us, people clustered
together," speaking French, Ger-
man, or English.

I noticed a group of Arabs
standing near a gold pillar. They
talked quickly, interrupting each
other in order to talk to two tall
blondes, who didn't look very in-
terested in the conversation.

It was crowded and hot, but the
girls still wore their suede and fur
jackets and held their glowing
cigarettes with ring-covered
fingers, constantly flicking ashes
onto the carpet.

”How'couId I ever have come’
here?" Jean-Marc asked. ’’It looks
so wonderful, but it is so boring.”

The noise seemed to intensify

”There have been many joys.
But it is like a bad marriage.
There may be some good times,
but to continue to stay together
is to only [to] prolong the agony.”

Pollock also said that financial
problems did not affect his deci-
sion, joking that his campaign
debts from 1985 would ”remain
a lasting memory of my commu-
nity service.” .

He said that he was proud of
his record. ’’I will leave council
with my head held very high. At

 
 

all times, I have maintained total
integrity and unflinching
courage,” he said.

’’I believe in the Jeffersonian
principle of government service.
When one assumes a public trust,
he should consider himself pub-
lic property. That is how I have
viewed my job and how I have
functioned. l have been a public
servant.”

The news conference was held
at the Westin William Penn
Hotel.

Racial—based quotas
should get the axe

The Supreme Court dealt a great blow to affirmative ac-
tion when it decided that the local government of Rich-
mond, Va., committed reverse discrimination by reserving
a fixed percentage of construction contracts for minority

businesses.

And rightly so. Action on discrimination should be left
to the courts and not the legislature. _

Nobody denies that racial discrimination still exists. But
it is no longer supported, or allowed, by our government,
except in the case of affirmative action. A person should
snot be discriminated against because he is a member of

I the majority any more than he should as-a member of a

minority.

Rather than by governmental quotas, racial discrimina-
tion should be dealt with on an individual basis, through
the enforcement of anﬁ-discrimination laws. If an individu-
al applies to a company and is turned down because of
- his or her race, then that company, according to the cur-
rent law, will be prosecuted. But to set quotas which send
‘employers scurrying to find minorities to fill jobs, regard-
less of whether other non—minority people are more quali-
fied, is redundant and hardly represents ”equality.”

Themeaning of life does exist

[...] I have a message for John
Berger, William Young, and
others with the same feelings as
them. It is one that you probably
heard before, but the truth is
worth telling over__and over.

This world is full of evil — no
argument there. It's not worth ex-
isting in its current state. The

LETTERS

good news is it won't. God has
already numbered the days; He
-wrote the Book on the beginning
and the end. _

You both have questions to
which I know the answers; not
because I am arrogant or a know-
it-all fool, but because I study the
answers; they are in the Bible.
The Lord sent His wordto us so

i that we could answer the awukn—
wak questions such as: Why

' doesn't God stop the suffering

now? God is not to blame for the
evil that is present, and He's not
to blame for not ending it im-
mediately. He has given us rules
to live by, [and] which if fol-
lowed, would end the suffering.

William Young, you mention
how nice it would be if people
lived the New Testament. You
are absolutely correct. Why
doesn't everybody grab a copy?
Because they don't want to. They
don't want the responsibility of
giving up their rebellion against
God. That is what evil is. If some-

thing is not good, which is of
God, then it is evil, whichis of I

Satan. Rebellion toward God is
the acceptance of Satan, which
yields only pain and suffering. [...]

God's secret isn't hard to find.
He won't dump the Bible on your
head-and force you to read it. If
you want to get in on the secrets,
I invite you to look for them. [...]

Collene A. Dugan
Man has no need for ”God"

I would Iikelto respond to the
opinions about ”God” and
religion that were in the Jan. 16
issue of The Pitt News. The bas-
ic facts need to be heard. Reli-
gons and ”God” were created for
two reasons: 1) People were

afraid of death, so they made up
the idea of heaven, a place of
eternal laziness; 2) People want-

ed an easy (lazy) way to control -

others, so they started to manipu-
late them by using the most
powerful tool that all religions

use: guilt. By equating guilt with .

sex, people became ashamed of
themselves for no reason. [...]

Man needs to start guiltlessly
rejecting all rel igons and work for
himself, not ”God” or ”society.”
In reality, there is no ”good of the
society,” only good for each in-
dividual. 

Open your eyes and face reali-
ty.  If man continues to believe
in religious or societal altruism,
the only results will be another
dark age, or total destruction of
the planet. The path that remains
is for man to start working for his
own rational needs and goals. If
each individual were productive
and happy, instead of lazy and
stupid, man could do almost any-
thing. Once ideas like ”God” and
”good of society” are rejected,
real progress can be made.

of Caryn Campbell, 24, and Julie
Cunningham, 26.

In Idaho, he confessed to two
killings, although he wasn't a sus-
pect in any crimes in that state.

EIIIZIIEI

A few days ago, Ted Bundy
started spouting out confession
after confession in hopes that he
could get a stay of execution by
saying he killed more people. He
told of how he terrorized, raped
and strangled his victims. Then
raped them again, even after they
were dead. Pretty gruesome.

This was a great strategy. In-
_stead of giving him a stay, they
‘should: have turned the voltage
meter up a little higher.

As it was, Ted Bundy received
2,000 volts of electricity for one
full minute. His head and right
calf were shaved to improve elec-
trical conductivity. His last words
were (according to a story in
yesterday's Pittsburgh Press), ”Jim
[CoIeman, his lawyer] and Fred
[Lawrence, a methodist minister
who spent the last night with Ted
Bundy], I'd like you to give my
love to my familyand friends.”

Then, ZAP. ’ ' '

In Oregon, Ted Bundy is sus-
pected in the murder of Rita Lor-
rainejolly, 17, and Vicki Hollar,
24. In Utah, he confessed to kill-
ing Mellisa Smith, 17; Laura
Anne Aime, 17; Nancy Baird, 23;
Nancy Wilcox, 16; Debi Kent,
17; Sandra Weaver, 17;’ Sue Cur-
tis, 17; and Debbie Smith, 17.

In the days leading up to the

execution, various demonstra-

tions were held. All against Ted .

Bundy. J

Outsidethe prison and around
the state of Florida, vendors were
selling shirts simply stating ”Burn
Bundy Burn."

Of course,’ some people were
opposed to Ted Bundy’s demise.
His mother was quoted as saying,
”I think it's barbaric! It's legalized
murder.” ‘Funny, she didn't men-
tion the illegal murders her son
committed.

Some may argue that life in pri-
son would be a tougher sentence
for Ted Bundy, but remember
that he has escaped from prison

before to commit more murders. A
That will no longer be aproblem. -
In" reality, the chair might just '

have been too good for him.

In Washington, Ted Bundy
confessed to killing Roberta Kath-

  Wrestlers open home
stand against Vikings

By Mike Rampa

» Staff Writer

The 6-1-1 Panther wrestling
team will bring its successful road
record back home to Fitzgerald
Field House for the first time this
season as it squares off against
25th-ranked Cleveland State
tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m.

The Panthers are currently

V ranked 19th in the nation accord-

ing to the latest coaches’ poll,
maintaining their previous rank-
ing even though they dropped an
Eastern Wrestling League match
to Lock Haven this past Saturday.

Tomorrow night's match will
‘pose another EWL challenge for
the" Panthers, and assistant coach
Stan Mousetis expects a close
match.

”Every time we wrestle them,
the match is always decided by
a couple of points,” Mousetis
said.

”There are going to be a coup-
le of key matches that will be es-
pecially tough.”

The matches Mousetis is refer-
ring to will be in the 126-pound
and 150-pound divisions.

Matt Rizzo, the Panther’s busi-
est wrestler, boasting a 24-14-1
overall. record and 3-4-1 dual
meet tally, will take on Cleveland
State's Guy Seko at 126. Rizzo,
with five pins, is currently tied for
the team high.

Panther Scott Hovan, 21-7
overall and 3-1 in dual meets
with three pins, will square off
against Dave Waldolrz.

After Pitt's first match against
Nebraska, Hovan admitted to
suffering from fatigue. He attribut-

ed this to making weight for the
first match of the season.

Although Hovan won a four-
point major decision during the
Nebraska meet, he was still dis-
appointed with his overall per-
formance.

Mousetis is confident Hovan is
in top shape and has honed his
skills over the long road trip.

”Scott is ready to wrestle. I
think he's used to the 150 pounds
he's carrying around now. Fa-
tigue should not really play a part
tomorrow night,” Mousetis said.

Another Pitt wrestler who
suffered from fatigue early on was
158-pounder Jeff Turner. Prior to
the season, Turner had just come
off a knee ‘injury and had only
been ‘wrestling live for about a
week. '

Although Turner's 15-5 record,
including five pins, would not
suggestthat he's struggling at all,
Mousetis thinks Turner is still on
the road to regaining peak shape.

”He’s getting back in shape,
and he's right on the brink right
now,” Mousetis said.

”A couple more training ses-
sions, a few more matches and a
little more rehabilitation, and he
should be in top form in no time
at all.”

Defending national champion
Pat Santoro (142 pounds) is un-
defeated in dual-meet competi-
tion, sporting an 8-0 record.

Panther heavyweight John
Owens is also 8-0 in dual meets.

Despite these impressive statis-
tics, Mousetis does not expect a
surefire win in any weight divi-
sion on Wednesday night.

Magnificent Mario as good as The Great One

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

Once there were two classes of
National Hockey League players:

Wayne Gretzky and everybody _

else.

Now, there are two players in
a class by themselves.

And, the way he is playing,
they may have to put Mario
Lemieux in a class all by himself.

’_’There is no other player like
him,” said the Edmonton Oilers’
Chris Joseph, one of the few who
has been a teammate of both
Mario the Magnificent and the
Great Gretzky.

In a season that is becoming
the stuff of which legends are

made, Lemieux — at age 23 '— is
threatening every single—season
NHL scoring record. Along the
way, he has picked up the woe-
begone Pittsburgh Penguins by
the straps of their skates and rock-
eted them into second place in
the competitive Patrick Division.

The people who know him
best — his coaches, his team-
mates, the Pittsburgh fans -
don’t know which is more amaz-
ing: that Lemieux is challenging
Gretzky’s single-season record of
215 points, or that the Penguins
are close to first place‘.

Pitt swimmers dismantle

By Scott Campbell

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's swimming team
headed to the mountains ‘last
Saturday to battle West Virginia
at Morgantown, but swimming

1 coach Dick‘ Bradshaw expected it
to be more of a day at the beach.

Not expecting the Moun-
taineers to be much of a threat,

Bradshaw juggled his lineup to
keep his team fresh as he had
earlier in the season against Clari-
on State. The result was much the
same, with Pitt winning,
135-109. '

”We had the opportunity to
give some of ourguys a little time
off from swimming their regular
events week after week and get-
ting stale,” said Bradshaw.

Although the Panthers fell be-
hind early in the meet and were
tied at 94 with only three events
left, Bradshaw was not worried.

”I felt pretty comfortable that
we'd win the last three events, so
I didn't change anybody. It turned
out to be about the way that I
figured we'd do. I figured we'd
score about 135 by switching the
lineup,” said Bradshaw.

Pitt swam most of the 13 events
without using their top swimmer
and still won eight events. The
only events that Bradshaw
stacked were the two relays, the
200—meter breaststroke, 200
backstroke, and 200 individual
medley.

The Panthers won all five. of

those events, anchoring the
victory.

The team of Tim Adams, Mike
Kozlina, Mark Dombroski and
Bill Folger opened the meet by
winning the 400 medley relay
with a time of 3:27.81.

Adams swam the 200 individu-
al medley for the first time this

year and won with a time of
1:55.91 . Teammate Eric Mattson '

finished a close third in one of his
best ‘meets yet, according to
Bradshaw.

Kozlina stayed at home in the
200 backstroke, his regular event,
and won it handily. Mattson
finished fourth, again with \his
best time ever.

Dombroski easily won his
regular event, the 200 breast-
stroke, ahead of teammates Bri-

an Deiderick and Matt Weist,

who finished third and fourth.
In the 100 freestyle, Folger
emerged victorious for the sec-
ond time this year with a time of
47.53. " .

In the relays, the team of.

Adams, Dombroski, Kozlina and
Folger won the 400 medley in
3:27.81. Folger, John Kesler,
Scottjeffries and Adams won the
400 freestyle relay with a time of
3208.1 1.

Bradshaw was also very happy
with the team that finished third
in that event. Team members Eric
Cornell, - Fred Constantini,
Stephen Goth and Eric Daum
each swam under 50 seconds,
the first time a ”B—team” has ac-

’ Mountaineers, 135-109

complished that feat this year.

Once again, Pitt divers domi-
nated their competition, easily
winning both events.

John Sharkey and Vernon Ye-
nick finished 1-2 and 2-1 in the
1-meter and 3-meter events,
respectively.

For the third time this year, Pitt
took the top three spots in a div-
ing event, when Phil Cruz
finished third in the 1-meter. Brad
Buchter finished fifth in both
events.

This weekend, the Panthers
travel to Villanova to compete
against the Wildcats. Villanova
lost to West Virginia two weeks
ago, and Bradshaw is expecting
a tough battle.

”We’l| probably go back to our
regular lineup for Villanova. They
might shave for us, like Penn
State did [when they beat Pitt two
weekends ago], so we'll have to
keep that in the back of our
minds. Villanova has nothing to
lose by shaving for us,” Bradshaw
said.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) —
Marty Schottenheimer, one of the
NFL’s winningest coaches the
past four years, was named coach
of the Kansas City Chiefs on
Tuesday.

Schottenheimer, 45, led the
Cleveland Browns into the
playoffs the past four years before
resigning in a dispute with own-
er Art Modell. He is the seventh
coach in Chiefs’ history.

”Marty Schottenheimer is
without doubt the most qualified
and proven coach available in
the NFL today,” Carl Peterson,
Chiefs president, said.

”His availability at this time is
both timely and fortunate for the

Kansas City Chiefs.”

Schottenheimer succeeds
Frank Gansz, whose firingjan. 5
completed a clean sweep of the
leadership of the Chiefs.

The Browns made the playoffs
in the four full years that Schot-
tenheimer was coach, losing the
AFC wild card game this year to
the Houston Oilers. Cleveland
narrowly lost the AFC champion-
ship game the previous two
years.

Gansz was hired to coach the
Chiefs two years ago when John
Mackovic was fired after taking
Kansas City to its first playoff
game in .15 years. Gansz had
records of 4-11 and 4-11-1.

less, Lemieux has broken Rick
Kehoe’s team career record of
722 points. He has figured in 60
percent of the Penguins’ goals
and, with Brown and Paul Coffey,
has given the Penguins —- a last-
place team only a year ago — a
feared power play.

And, he's getting even better.

’’I think I did pretty well for the
first half of the season  but I can
do a lot better,” Lemieux said.
”Right now, I'm more concerned
with the team winning.”

”He is so'big and strong and
smooth,” said the Oilers’ Mark
Messier. ”As he gets older, he's
gotten a lot stronger  and
better.”

The 6—foot-4, 215—pound
Lemieux shrugs off talk of what
he has accomplished, because he
has yet to reach his ultimate goal:

Pittsburgh. .

  
   

If the records come, fine, as
long as the Penguins keep win-
ning, Lemieux said. Their 26-17-4
record is the best to date in the
club's 22-year history. They trail
the division-leading New York
Rangers by five points entering
Wednesday night's home game
against the Winnipeg Jets.

’’I’m going to have a shot at the
records,” Lemieux said. ’’I know
I can do all that  but going to
the playoffs, getting into first
place is what concerns me.”

”Until this year, I never thought
anybody could do what Wayne
Gretzky did,” Ubriaco said. ”Af-
ter seeing Mario for half a season,
[I see that] he can do it, break the
records. There's no limit to what
he can do.”

Sukova upends Navratilova in Aussie Open

By Rick Warner

I AP Tennis Writer

MELBOURNE, Australia —
Helena Sukova, who halted Mar-
tina Navratilova’s 74-match win-
ning streak at the 1984 Australian
Open, knocked the three-time
champion out of the Grand Slam
tournament again Tuesday night.

The_ big-serving Czech beat
Navratilova 6-2, 3-6, 9-7 in a dra-
matic quarterfinal before a
packed center-court crowd at the
National Tennis Stadium.

”The last time I beat her here,
I was just trying to win a set,”
Sukova said. ”This time, I thought

I had a chance to win.”
Navratilova twice served for
the match in the seesaw final set,
but Sukova held her off with a
series of sizzling backhand

After Sukova saved two break

Navratilova appeared ready to

However, Sukova quickly gained
a match point and watched a
shaky Navratilova hand her the
victory on a double fault.

”It was nerve-wracking out
there,” Sukova said. ”I was try-
ing very hard not to think about
the score.”

Navratilova, who hasn't won a
Grand Slam title since the 1987
U.S. Open, was upset by her
failure in the clutch.

”I gave her the match at the
end,” she said. ’’I wasn't out-
played. It was just a matter of a
couple of points here and there.”

The victory was Sukova’s sec-

chance to win.

2-6, 6-1. The other semifinal pits
defending champion Steffi Graf of
West Germany against archrival
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina.

Graf, who hasn’t lost a set in
the tournament, breezed past
eighth-seeded Claudia Kohde—
Kilsch of West Germany 6-2, 6-3
in 55 minutes, while Sabatini ral-
lied from 1-3 down in the final set
to beat sixth—seeded Zina Garri-
son of the United States 6-4, 2-6,
6-4.

In men's play, longtime rivals
Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe set
up a quarterfinal showdown with
straight—set victories.

Lendl recovered from a slow
start to beat Israeli Amos Mans-
dorf 7'6 (7'2)/ 6-41 6‘2, 

McEnroe cruised to a 7-6 (7-4),

6-2, 6-3 victory over fellow
American Aaron Krickstein.
”|’ve come a long way,” said

McEnroe, who is trying to regain
the form that made him the
world's No. 1 player in the early
1980s. ”I feel more comfortable
mentally, and my game is com-
ing together.”

Two—time champion Stefan Ed-
berg is scheduled to play 11th-
seeded Thomas Muster of Austria
in another quarterfinal Wednes-
day. Edberg injured his back near
the end of his 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 win
over hometown hero Pat Cash
and may not be able to play.

Muster reached his first Grand
Slam quarterfinal with a 6-3, 6-2,
7-5 victory over unseeded Mag-
nus Gustafsson of Sweden.
