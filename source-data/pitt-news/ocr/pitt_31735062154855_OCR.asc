B3! ‘JOANNE DOLINAR

(This is the third. in a series of

articles conce'rm'.ng the implemen-

.ta,!.ion‘of the trimester program at the Universitly next year.)

The area which seems to be lagging most in planning for
trimesters is that of student affairs. g

The administratiorrhas left most of the planning for in-
dividual student organizations up to the groups, but as yet
none of them havecome up with any deﬁnite ‘plans. The ad‘-
ministration, however, has,clcne some planning in this area. ‘

Dr. John Geise, assistant chan-
cellor of student affairs, has stated

 that class organization under the

trimester plan will be in,terms of
school classes, e.g. Engr. ’60,
rather than University classes, e.g.
Class of 1960. . ' A

Emphasis on Terms
He admitted, that some new
method of retaining class identity
and University allegiance as al-
umniwould have to be instituted.
Dr. Geise further believes that
once trit_erms are in full effect,
a result will be increased em-
phasis on terms rather than the
academic year. He foresees ma-
jor activity emphasis on fall and.
inter terms for “at least .two
- years.” ~
Triterms would seem to call for
a change in commencement dates.
The University will keep the
June Commencement, however,
although terms will end in Dec-
ember, April, and August.

j_\ Because of the size of the
group of degree recipients each
year, unless not all of the stu-
dents are graduated at once, it
would not be feasible to hold
the ceremonies indoors.

One explanation for this might
be that most groups were awaiting
the inauguration of new officers
expected to solve the problems
since they are more directly con-
cerned.

War Most Urgent

By DEBORAH WILLSON
The two most important

problems facing mankind are
War and over population, ac-
cording to Norman Thomas,
Socialist leader who spoke
here Thursday.

_ ‘ Man must recognize that he has

responsibility towards those who
suffer from the poverty and dis-
ease which come from excessive

2’ 7 population, Thomas feels.

Though the Socialist is critical
of the New Deal, he feels it did
make at step forward in this area;
Roosevelt, there was no

longer a Question of - whether
America would assume some of
the responsibilities of a,..“welfare
state,” but how she‘would do so.
As far as the problem of war
goes, Thomas said that though we
are currently involvedonly in a
“cold” war, it is by no means de-
void of danger. .
Vested Interest Arices
He‘ says that countires of the
‘ world are building garrison states,

~ which is enormously. dangerous.

Also, there is a large “vested in-
terest” group which is beneﬁtting
from the cold war. Many workers,
for example, feel that the depres-
sion of the 30’s was ended by a
war, and that the reason we are
prospering now is mainly the
“cold” war.

Thomas contends, too, that

men really do not abhor war; '

they _love the glory of it. He
' cites in support of this view
~- the popularity of Fidel Castro in
this country.

In looking at these factors, then,
Thomas thinks that any cessation
of the “cold” war is unlikely, and
that any restriction of war to
“limited warfare” is unlikely also.
He feels that “people do not spre-

. pare weapons they don’t expect to
use” and that it is unlikely that
in the heat of warfare sober judg-
ment will pr_evail over the im-
pulse to use the most effective
weapon.

Prerequisites Mentioned

As a solution Thomas proposes_

"four “prerequisites to peace.”
These are: (1) universal disarma-
ment to a police level; (2)

strengthening the United Nations:

NORMAN Thomas emphatically illustrates a point in his speech
to the Social Science Seminar last Thursday. Thomas, many times
Socialist candidate for president, discussed the problems of war

a job as it could, but the power of
the Security Council is a serious
block to effective action.
(3) is “disentanglement” with
regard to defensive alliances_;
and (4.) a really effective fight
against poverty and disease all
over the world. Thomas does
not think the American method
of “aiding” poorer countries
good. “No one at the bottom of
the hill really loves the rich
man at the top even if he gives
then an ‘occasional hand-out,”
he illustrated. I
Thomas feels that the Western
powers are by no means blameless
in_ continuing the “cold’.’ war, per-
haps on_ account of the ‘fvested
interests” which benefit from it.
They should not be too quick to
charge the Russians with hypoc-
risy in their alleged desire for
peace, Thomas contends.
The Western powers them-
selves have only recently ig-
nored a disarmament proposal
from a Polish minister. “Rus-
sia does have legitimate fears,”
says Thomas. The “fest seems
to want a rearmed Germany in‘
NATO,‘ and Russia fears Ger-
many greatly. (The Berlin ulti- ,
matum probably grew out of
this fear.) At any rate Thomas
does not feel continued delay in
disarmament to be harmless.
The American"s' “curious combi-
nation of apathy and fatalism”
and the “mishandling of news” by
American papers are to blame for
a large part of the problem,
Thomas asserts. “We ‘must rea-
lize,” he says, “that we cannot
keep coming through crises with
no solutions.” Thomas ends with
an admonishment to the new gen-
eration: “Unless you can. make
some progress along these lines
(his proposals) none of you may
live to be as old as I am.”

 ,lg’dst of   Carnivals?

The 1959 Spring Carnival may be the last of these

as annual events. The problem of how‘ Spring Carnival may
’;_f_l>e integrated into trimesters has baffled agtivity leaders.

The utility of holding a Carnival even under a semester
:program was questioned this year and the further com-

:' plications of trimesters may be the deciding factor.
‘ In the ﬁrst place, Spring ‘Carnival, .as now scheduled,.
g would fall in the third trimester, during which next year

onlysome freshmen and sophomores will attend. Even

 after next year, fewer‘ students are likely to attend \the
"third trimester than will attend the ﬁrst two.

Spring Carnival could be‘ scheduled earlier, but '/poor

1’ weather conditions would prevent it beingheld outdoors.

One possible solution is to hold it in the Field House in
vMar_ch before the close of the Winter Triterm, but this so-

’:._lution too has inherent\difﬁculties.' ~

The success or failure of this year’s Carnival will -no

- doubt be givenlheavy consideration in the discussion of the

‘fate of the program. Since only four shows will be pre-
sented as opposed to last year’s nine, the Carnival is start-

 ing with over two strikes against it.

.The supporters of each ‘of the shows provided business

  the past for the other shows and booths, but this year
__‘ far fewer of these natural patrons will. be present. This is
another reason the wood-theft incidents which resulted in.

"the elimination of two.shows were particularly ‘unfortunate.

If students desire to have Carnival continued, and some ’

i have expressed lack of interest in the whole program, they

_— must support the Carnival of this year. Publicity planners

for the event must utilize all available communications

-;;media, including radio and television to interest the out-

, side public in Carnival. , /
C Weather conditions often put a damper -to the Carnival

;and it is to be hoped that this year the planners selected

more favored dates. a _
Perhaps some think that the frivolity of Carnival does
not ﬁt into the higher intellectual standards of the Uni-

-fy versity, but more are just too lazy to work hard: even, to
f haveia good time. Carnival does have a deﬁnite ‘place on

the campus, but its worth may_ not be realized until it is

 ‘Beat’ Berates Bellows

By Lorraine Lesoon

So there we were, Andy and I, sitting in the
balcony listening to Mr. Richards’ lecture. He told
all about how a poem has a physical aspect and
a ‘self."That you can’t take a poem and sayﬂit
means a certain thing ’cause’it _means different
things" to different people and  

   
  
 
 
  
  

I thought he had a charming
British accent. ‘

And then there was Mr.’ Mc-
Cormick who told all about how
you have to ﬁnd a place where
you can think and» write. Think- 
ing reading and writing, in any -“
order he said, it didn’t matter
He’s right too. That’s -‘why I H A 
think writers should be rich, so hey.
place to be alone _and have enough money to buy
books and some other things too maybe. But you
should’ve seen Andy, he was all shook when Mr.
McCormick got up to speak ’cause he thought he
was gonna talk about how to write books and sell
them-too cause he’s a materialist, Andy, I mean.

Well, we werepretty,‘ tired by three so we sat
down. Mr. Nicholson talked about how carefully
the Saturday Evening 'P6st ‘ is in selecting their.
articles. Andy wasn’t impressed but I don’t know
why. He; didn’t use note cards. Anyway after he
was ﬁnished this guy with all the rhetorical ques-
tions got up. (In the morning question-answer
session he gave a speech on juvenile delinquency).
He told him that he thought he had all the quali-
ﬁcations for being a good magazine writer and— Mr.
Nicholson told him to submit an outline. I thought
that was kinda nice. By the way, Andy’s my friend.
He writes too. Check manuscripts.

So anyway I stayed around school ’cause I have

 

a night class on Wednesday night. Well anyway, '

my instructor, he’s pretty hep on writing too, let
usout early to hear» Mr. Bellows speak. Some of
the'kids didn’t go but maybe it was better that
way. You see, it was pretty bad.
Sleep. Ten Leave _ ,
After he told about how the‘ anecdote, and all
was sorta passe and that it was really style that
counted, some ‘angry’ young man beat —— his hand
back and forth, rose, took a bow, seated’ himself
and told Mr. Bellows that he stunk. Nice ‘guy!
Well‘this guy must’ve been pretty ignorant because

the M. C. of this Conference didn't ask for opin-
ions, just questions. “

Anyway this guy waves his hands out and then
in again towards his chest like he was stabbed or
something (maybe he’ was an actor) and keeps
telling him how he (Bellows) put 11 people to

‘ sleep and drove ten out of the auditorium. ‘What.

I can’t understand is how a guy‘ can watch 11
people fall asleep, see ten walk out of the audi-
torium and still say thathe heard the speech and
that it was lousy. This guy’s‘either a joker ‘or needs
help.

I But Saul was really a sport about it. “After all”
he says, “look how ‘everyone deserted Jesus
Christ?’ Everyone clapped cause I think that they
really felt bad about this joker in the balcony.
Anyway after about ten sickening minutes some-
one asks him, in view of the previous outburst,
an intelligent question.

Instructor Joins In

There were a few more of these and then you
‘know what Saul said, and.he looked all around at
the audience when he said it, “I’m sorry if I bored
you this evening.” I wanted to die, I really did.
I don’t think I’ll forget it as long as I live. _

You’d think that would be bad enough wouldn’t
you. It wasn’t. Another guy gets up and tells how
he’s a college instructor andlhow scholarly he is
and how the joker up in the balcony wasn’t too
diplomatic, he agrees, but “Saul, I’ think you stink
too.” This guy sure thought a lot of himself, per-
sonally I think he made (a ‘boo-boo—no), a hyper-
bolie—yes. There’s one in every crowd but in this
oneithere were two. After that I couldn’t stay‘ any
longer. I had to leave. ‘

"But one thing I have to say is that Saul ‘is
quite a guy, cause I think if that was me I
would’ve Vwalked right off that stage. Can you
imagine, two quacks, (yes, they go to college too)
tell a guy that’s written six novels that he’s out
of it. Oh, don’t get me wrong, I think people

shouldbe outspoken, and say what they think but‘

you don’t just get up and tell a person who has
traveled 500 miles, answered a lot of stupid ques-
tions all morning, and who is perfectly willing to

debate the issue or issues involved, that he’s lousy.‘

I don’t know. I don’t know if I’ll ever go to
another writers’ conference again. I was so ashamed
and embarrassed. But maybe next year, the above
mentioned scholarly critics will stay home. But
then again you.can never be sure.

Letters To The Editor

Professor Hits Back
On African Freedom

Editor, The Pitt News:

In a. recent issue (April 22)
of the Pitt News, Richard Johns-
ton presented a series of argu-
ments against African inde-
pendence. Essentially, Mr. Johns-
ton establishes a double standard
by which nations are to be judg-
ed, one standard for the advanc-
ed countries and another (and
impossibly high one) for colon-

'ial peoples. His arguments are

essentially as follows:

1. “The political stability of
Africa is so shaky that not even
the African leader (Tom Mboya)
can predict which way the winds
will blow.”

One ‘need only recall the prac-
tically constant turmoil in France
to see that “political stability” is
“shaky” also in some of the na-
tions which are supposedly ﬁt_.- to
prepare colonial peoples for self
rule.

2. “Are the African leaders
ready to be entrusted with the
future power over millions of na-
tiveAfricans and hundreds of
thousands of Europeans now liv-
ing in Africa?” '

Can the African leaders do

. much worse than the Dutch

overlords -of South Africa? Or
the Portugese? Or the French in

Algeria? And by the‘ way, were,

the 13 colonies ready for inde-
pendence when they won it --
violently, by the Way? Weren’t
there rebellions ,—- Shays’ and
the Whiskey Insurrection?
Weren’t there violations of’ in-
dividual rights under the alien
and sedition laws? .
Wasn’t there one of the blood-
iest givil wars fn’history? Don’t
nations. have 3&0 V1éarn~.--tq.--‘‘gove'rn

    
   

  

George III or the French colon-

ials office and the South African
, Ministry for Native Affairs? ‘

Perhaps most remarkable of
all is Mr. Johnston’s suggestion
that it is -eminently fair- for
60,000 whites in Kenya to have
equal representation with six
million Africans.

“This would seem to be the
only way the minority rights of
the Europeans could be protect-
ed against the majority desires
of the lAfricans,” Mr. Johnston
tells us. , ~'

I conclude from this that Mr.

.'Johnston feels that the Negro
citizens of Alabama should have.

half the seats in the legislature
of that state (instead of none, as
is the case at present.) But per-
haps we had better not say any-
thing. about Alabama and min-
ority rights. '
Mr. Johnston concludes that

, Africans must be kept in colon-

ial status —- in the interests of
“the free world.’’

I have no reasons to doubt
Mr. Johnson’s sincerity. But he
speaks the classic language of
imperialism. He would do well

.to consult the history of his own

nation’s< struggle against colon-
ialism, and to remember that we

too have stumbled once or twice

on the hardroad to democracy.

‘African Struggles’
Critic Commended

Editor, The Pitt News: _

I have A just ﬁnished reading
the article by Richard Johnston,
“A Sword in Our Side,” that was’
published in the Pitt,News, April

  

  

outlined by Mr. Johnston.
Judging from the applause Mr.
Mboya received, I think that
most people did not stop for once
and think over the situation as
it pertains to America and’ the
power struggle with Russia. Mr.
Mboya stated repeatedly that the
“African Struggle” is not only
an African problem, but a world

‘problem—“a human problem.”

But as he was saying this he was
advancing restrictions as. to our
concern. He said in effect that
the “African Struggle” is a, “hu-
man problem” with which you
should be concerned if you agree
with us;'if- you don’t, agree that
African people cannot be held
responsible for the use ‘of force
that "they will surelyuse if we
don’t get our own way immedi-
ately. ‘

New Mr. Mboya’s thinly veiled
threats of violence were in very
poor,- taste —- at» the least a
stupid move ora man trying to
arousesymgiathy for his “human
struggle.” . ' _

Mr. Mboya stated that the
African. peoples had their‘ econ-
omy geared to the European
colonial powers. Now, if inde-
pendence is declared for all of
Africa —- which is what Mr.
Mboya demands, this will not
mean thatjthe economy will be
regeared immediately, also. The
African countries will still need
the European countries as a
ﬁnancial crust.

How much will the European
countries or even the United
States invest i'n'a country where
they will not be sure it is going"
to be safe from destruction, by
am anti—white demolition mob
or an over zealous government,

‘Subbing’ .Weightlifters
Editor, The Pitt News: Q ‘
The Pitt News ' has done it
again. In the April 20! issue the
News stated that the Military
Ball helped Ohio State win the
NCAA Weightlifting“ Champion-
rship. It also made Ken Malley,
one of the top men in_ the
AFROTC, appear as if he failed
the school by attending. the Mili-
tary Ball. This impression. not
only reached the Pitt News read-
ers but appeared in one of Pitts-

‘ burgh’s more creditable ‘news-

papers. .,

Mr. Malley is not and neve

was aweightlifter. He is a letter-

_ man in baseball. Leo Bemis ask-
ed Malley to be in the meet a‘nd
Malley agreed, on the condition
that the'meet be held in the
afternoon. ~— ..

When he found out that the
time had been changed to the
evening, he spoke to Bemis and
told him that he could not be in
the meet. Bemis said that this
was all right with him. He would
ﬁnd someone else.

The reasons that Malley went
to the Military Ball are:

1'. The Military. Ball is a social
event, but all cadets are requir-

-  to attend in orderlto ﬁndpoutr
’ how. "a Military-V _s‘ocial aﬁairmis

run. This requirementis includ-
ed in the cadet regulations.
2. Mr. Malley had already

bought his ticket, and his wife

was prepared to attend the Ball.
If the Pitt News staff would

investigate. ’a story fully before]
delinating a student, ‘who may <-

one "day fly an airplane .in de-
fense of his country and the
right of .this paper -to publish,
misunderstandings of this sort
would not occur.

The Pitt News would do well

to publish a retraction of this
affair to Ken Malley who is now

— looked down upon by his fellow
. students and his neighbors.

First, paper plates. Then paper

THE MANY LOVES
OF THORWALD DOCKSTADER

When Thorwald Dockstade.r—sophomore,epicure, and sports-
ma.n—ﬁrst took up smoking, he did not simply choose the first
brand of cigarettes that came to hand. He did what any sopho-
more, cpicure, and sportsman would do:. he sampled several
brands and then picked the Inildest, t.:1.st.iest, pleasingest of all
-—Philip Morris, of corris! V

Similarly, "when Thorwald took 11p girls, he did not simply
select the first one who came along. He sampled. First he took
out an English literature major named Elizabeth Barrett Grisht,
a. wisp of a. girl with luminous eyes and a soul that shimmered-'
with a pale‘, unea.rt.hly beauty. Tripphigly, trippingly, she
walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat with him behind
a windward dune and listened to a sea shell and sighed sweetly
and took out a little gold pencil and a little morocco notebook .

and wrote a little poem: , '

I will Ho upon the share,

I will be a. d-rcmner.

I will feel the sea once more
Porurorcling on pzy femur.

Thorwald’s second date was with a physical Education major
named Peaches Glendower, a broth of a girl with a. ready smile
A and a size 18 neck. She took Thorwald down to the cinder track
where they jogged around 50 times to open the pores. Then they
played four games of squalsh, six sets of tennis, 36 holes of golf, p
nine innings of one old cat, six chukkers of lacrosse, and a mile
and a quart,-er of leap frog; Then they went ten rounds with eight-
ounce gloves and then they had heaping bowls of bran and whey
and exchanged a manly handshake and went home to their
respective whirl pool baths.

Thorwald’s ﬁnal date was with a golden-haired, c1'ea.my-
browed, green-eyed, red—lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi

“Gee whillikers, what's college for anyhow—tolﬁll your head
fullof. icky old facts, or to discoverthe shining essence that is
YOU?” ' ~ '

_‘ Totsi started the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious
restaurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornish rock
hen. Froin there they went to a de luxe mdvie palace where
Totsi had popcorn with butter. Then she had a. bag of chocolate
covered raisins-also with butter. Then they went to a costly
ballroom and gcha-cha.’d till dawn, tipping ‘the band every eight.
bars. Then they went to a Chinese restaurant where Totsi, un-
able to decipher the large and baffling menu, found a simple
