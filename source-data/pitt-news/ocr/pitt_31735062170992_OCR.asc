The Chancellor‘ took this action‘

-"as an earnestof my faith in the

The College of Arts and Sci-

without debate. several A new

courses for fall term of 1973.

The new courses were termed
by Dean Schneewind. who is head
of the Council. as "exciting.'a real
indication of the forward looking
aspect of the Colleges appear-
ances and prospects over what
might be considered the next sev-
eral years. which is. of course.
conditional upon the definition of
exciting."

Among the new courses are a
four course program Dental -and
Musical Interdisciplinary Nu-
sances (DEMIN). The courses
will deal with the effect of ploy-
tonic symphonic composition on
the structure of the .pr,e-dental
student in the modern world and
will be offered every Saturday

_ and Sunday after the symphony

concerts in the Carnegie Music
Hall bathrooms.

Another new course. oftered by
the Department of Military Sci-
ences. is a one open to all under-
graduates entitled "Lrban Coun-
ter-lnsurgency Three." The par-
ticpiants in this course..as Colo-
nel Mishtowt explained. will meet
every ’l‘uesday and Wednesday
night and be expected to walk
from the Cathedral_to Trees Hall
and back without getting them-
selves hurt and without calling
for the assistance of the Campus
Police. I

The Sociology Department will
also be oftered an exciting new
course. This C0tll‘S€. relying heav-
ily on the works of Alfred Jensen.
will teach members of radical po-
litical groups “how to prove that
what they are doing is pointless
because poor people are inherent-
ly and genetically inferior and are

-poor because they wish to be so."

The only pre-requisite is that a

Lstudentmust have been arrested

at least twice for political activ-
ity. such as putting up posters.

A similar course is being taught

by the Graduate School of Busi-~
ness, with the assistance of the

University Pharmacy. Though
the course will not be given for
CAS credit, the sense of the Coun-
cil was that it would be ‘-‘a valid
learning experience for the up and
coming undergraduate’ who is
planning a business career.”

This course. "The ECOHOITTICS of

‘ Peddling." will deal with the prob-

lems of procuring. marketing.
and controlling the demand for
lb_\‘ advertising l€Cl1_IllqU€St nox-
ious substances/such as cannabis

Fiiially'. the Council approved
an_ independent study course
which will. be cross-listed with
the Psychology and_ Physiology
Departments. This innovative
course will be offered for 30 cred-

to live with at least 10 other stu-

The room will contain cans of

ln other business. the CAS Coun-

floor to adjourn the meeting and
schedule one for next week at the

out-ot-order, however. by stu-

I Dungeon Discovered
 Be/ow Studio Theatre

/3.

University administrators are
trying to deny the existence to-
day of the dungeon discovered by
Oneda Mop late last night below
the Cathedral of Learning.

Mop explained. "I was taking
a break when all this noise start-
ed coming from down below. I
followed by nose into the Studio
Theater an fell through the floor
into a large cell."- ‘

Mop said that she evidently had
fallen through a trap door care-
lessly left open by one of the keep-
ers. She said she found herself
lying on a cold, straw covered
floor (“I loved it,” she said). By
the dim light of sputtering torches
she recognized the members of
the Pantiettes hanging from the
wall at various unnatural angles
from chains.

Asked what she did next. Mop

said. "I told them to shut their
god-damned mouths and" quit dis-
turbing m_y sleep when I'm work-
ing. p

“Then I climbed back’ out and
shut the door so no one else would

fall through. On the way out 1‘

passed Vice-Chancellor Boye. He
said hello and tried to hide his
Tom Thumb‘ sidekick."

An hour later the noise again

' picked up and Mop’ was again

The Chancellor seemed weary
as I crossed the sumptuous ex-

He looked like a man who had an-

and over the past several days.
I was hesitant to intrude on his
time. but I went on.

far and marched over to the Pitt

antics of the’"then darned com-

Chancellor Wesley Negvar was
reported in meditation in his
wine cellar and was unavailable
for comment.

I took out my notebook before
I spoke with him from the coin-
fortable guest chair. My pencil
was too sharp; I would have to be
careful not to break it because it

Councilman Richard Callajury commented. "This should have
been done long ago." When asked how Council finally persuaded the
Mayor to return the traffic to two-waylanes. Callajury replied. "We
made him an offer he couldn‘t refuse."

Mayor ,Flanerty was not available for comment. .

The report that the Bureau of Missing Persons had listed Flanerty
as missing since early last night was denied by Democratic spokesman
Eugene Raccoon. who said. "I wouldn‘t worry about it . . . the Mayor
will surface sooner or later.“ '

interview.

“Mr. Chancellor, there has
been a great deal of comments
about your car. Would you care to
clarify this?” ‘

"I‘m getting a little tired of the
same questions over and over. but
I think I can clarify this.

\

“The car in questionis a‘ Cad-
illac. There -has never. been any
attempt to conceal this fact. They
gave it to me. and'I am using it.
Wouldn't you?"

“I really can’t answer that ques-
tion, Mr. Chancellor. I am here
for information, not for you to in-
terview me.”

“Very well. What would you .
like to know about the Cadillac?"

"Some of us find it hardfto be-

lieve. Mr.‘Chancellor. that you

would accept the use of such a
symbol of. degenerate bourgeois

' at a time when the University and

its students are

“It may be hard to believe, but
there are some aspects of Univer-
sity life over which I have no di-
rectlcontrol.

"The Cadillac is one of them. I
did not order it: it is one of what '
we call "mandated costs":'in ef-
fect. if we turned down the Cadil-
lac. we would be turning down the
entire budget. and the University
would have to get by on what it.
could scrounge on street corners."

After some hard questioning
Bluey broke down. "You aren‘t

Bluey would not expand or clar-

When asked by the Pitt News

From m_y vantage point within
the ‘‘For- Pete's Sake" litter bas-
ket on the mantle I could hear
the voice of the Mayor as he burst
though the front door of his per-
menent residence in Somerset.
Pa.: ‘'1 did it. Nancy." he ex-
claimed to hiswite. "I did it."
I locked the gates of the city and
swallowed the key!

"Pittsburgh is dying and I say
let it die. The nuts are all locked
in now. there is no escape."

“The people are never satis-
fied,” he continued, “I paved 32
miles of roadway in the last year,
didn't I?”

“You certainly did. Pete." Nan-
cy agreed. "but the 32 miles led
from City Hall to here in Somer-
set. clear. Maybe they are angry
about that. And I cut the wage tax

for thousands. what's wrong with

that?" .

At that rhetorical question. I
could not resist. I leaped out of
my hiding place and said. "Well
what about the jobs that Pitts-
burgh lost due‘ to your inaction —
what about-those thousands?"

The mayor quickly retored, “I
cut their wage tax and their wages
too. What could be fairer than

that? While I marvelled at one
of his famous non-equiturs,” he
asked, “Who are you?”

I told him I was a reporter tor
the Pitt News and then explained
to him what a reporter was and
how to get to the University in a
non-election year.

Now he was confused and in his
state of befuddlement consented
to grant me an interview. asking
that I first explain to him what an
interview is. '

I did this and to his amazement
he said, “I remember now, an in-
terview is something you do be-
fore elections, sort of like talking
to the peons . . . er people, hugh?”
I nodded.

He shook me violently and I
woke up. “Pete." I began. "you
say you will be running on your
record‘?."

"This is true." he replied.

"What is your record?" I con-
tinued the interview.

“Well,” he said, “I used to hold
the yo-yo longevity record but
some idiot student took that from
me. Now‘I guess the -only real
record I have is Marty Slom-
ber’s copy of “Speedo.”

ln a- major press release over
the weekend. the Athletic’Depart-

Wxment of the University ‘declared

r

X

that the game of pinball has taken

over the priority of‘ the number
one varsity sport. ‘

Athletic Director Cassy iVlis—
inglinksi announced late Satur-

- day night from the window of his

office in the“Cathedral of Learn-
ing that “its time the varsit."
sports program became relevant

‘ to the most popular interests of
the student body.“-

Also announced by Misinglinksi
was that all other varsity sports
would experience a budget cut-
back somewhere in the neighbor-

‘ _TWO PITT, pinball recruits are -captured »here unaware that they are

hood of" 89 or 90 per cent. The cut-
back in funds wouldthen enable
Pitt to create a pinball program
equal to universities that are in
the same sports level as Pitt. or
as Misinglinski put it. “A Pinball
Program Deluxe."

'Pitt.would then begin vtogive
sc_holarships to prospective. pin-
ball phenoms, as the local com-.
munity seems to be overflowing

with such prospects. The‘ prime’
"candidate for the first ride is

rumored to be a local yokel‘ that
“-attended” Schenley High School.

But Misinglinksi first warned.
against the speculation of recruit-

_ing_ the young man. stating that

Pitt is still in tlhemaijket for a

The Pitt Mews has learned that Pittsburgh Pirate manager '
been under ‘pressure from both the president"

to make ‘changfes on his team——chan'ges that would make the

Bourbon also stressed the necessity to keep a defensively ‘poor

_first baseman anchored there as wellas moving one of the best

defensive first sackers in the game to left field.‘ _ '
"Here read it yourself." Bourbon said in a recent inter-

yiew. "Do you fhinkl would makethose changes on my own?"

The letter, stamped top secret, revealed the necessity for '

Bourbon’s mysterious experiments. .
it read: “The National League“Clubs have been losing mon-

Among the names kicked
around by A Misinglinski were
"Tommy." “Jake." and Curly De-
PastQua. DePastQua. as may be
remembered. was once a head
coach of some varisty sport at
‘Pitt. although Misinglinksi swore
that the name "was not familiar
to him."

Misinglinksi also remarked that
now that Pitt has a pinball team,_
a pinball stadium would have to

be built. Unit] the construction of ’

“The University of Pittsburgh
Pinball Palace” is completed, a
temporary playing site will have
to be established.

"Gee that's tough.” Mising-
linksi chortled. “We could rent
out the Pinxall Wizard but that
might be a teensy weensy bit too
small. We might take our pinball-_
-ers to Wolfhearth's Pub but then

' .there‘s the age proxlem."".
Whentquestioned as to what.

measures the recruiting would go.
.Mislinksi said. "Money is no prob-
lem; We're prepared to make any
offer to _an_vbody that even looks
like a wiz with the _.silver ball.
_Open bank accounts. new cars.
you name it and we will give it."
The Athletic‘ Departimenthas al-
ready installed three‘ dozen pin-

' ballers to practice on and there is

also speculation that an intra-
mural pinball program will devel-‘
op soon.‘ _ _ ‘ ’
"We're tried of the public as-
sociating the name of the Univer-
sity with a poor varsity sports
program.“ Misinglinksi gulped.

April 1, i973—THE PITT MEWS;-Page 9  ._l  

Pinball   Declared Varsity Sport      

"lt"lll take too long to develop a
successful prograni. in any other
field. so why not be a collegiate
trailblazer and venture into what
is bound to become the prominent
sport in the NCAA." ‘

Reports from the various local
pinball establishments have been

that several Pitt personnel have‘
been frequenting the machines in-

the last few weeks. Misinglinksi

‘confirmed these rumors.
“Certainly we’ve been watching‘

))

the Oakland area, he chirped.
“We’re also scouting the State
College area quite heavily-and
we’re set on winning the pinball
recruiting war.”

Among the sports that have suf-~

fered the severe cutbacks is foot-

ball and the new head coach. Dixie '
_Minors. is not taking the switch

in alloted expenditures laying
down. Found" cleaning out his of-
fice in preparationto move into
a janitor's closet at the stadium.
Minors said. “You all."

The first of a series of pinball
recruits are expected to flood the
campus-sometime next weekend.

Dean Bullwick. Pitts sports in-
formation' director. has released
the attendance statistics from the
1972 football season and has per-

_ sonally declared it aibanner year

For. the five home contests. ‘Pitt

averaged a minus one thousand.

‘in the ticket sales department. As
far as the actual head count at the
contest. no figure was released.

“Naw, naw, we couldn’t count
no heads,” Bullwick explained,
“cuz da guy dat wuz' suppozed to
count ’em never shlowedvup at da

Bullwick explained that it“ was an

The Pitt Hockey Club has re-
cently announced that they are

putting in a bid for a franchise in

the fledging World Hockey As-
sociation and fully expect to be in
the league next season.

Pitt has won the Commissioners
Cup of the Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Hockey _Asocia-
tion two years running and they
cite that as the basis of consider-
ation for the WHA franchise.

“We can_play just as bad as
any WHA team going.“ remark-
ed Lightweight Baginski. member
of the club. “The World Hockey
Association is nothing more than
a circus so we'll fit right in."

Founder of the WHA and ABA,
Gary Davidson, said that the Pitt
squad would receive special con-
sideration since it is not a varsity
team and could turn -professional
without being expelled from any
amatuer association. ' A

President not the Pitt Hockey
Club Bobby Orrtesta explained
why he felt that the team would
qualify as a serioous WHA con-
tender.

“Our team has anything that
any World Hockey Association
team has." Orrtesta said. "We
can barely skate but we love to
light; were the filthiest players
in the city of Pittsburgh. including
the Penguins; we can‘t get along
with any coach and we have the
personnel to match any team in
the WHA. for example. the New
England Whalers have Ted Green.
well we have Gary Cummings.

Cliff Wise, the proprietor of the.

Alpine Area, the “home” of the
Pitt skaters, claimed that Pitt
could play all of their games at

the Alpine.

“Sure. I‘d love to have them
here.“ Wise said. "The Philadel-
phia Blazers couldn't draw more

. than a couple of thousand but here

on my Olympic ice it‘ll be a differ-
ent story all together.“ '
The only problem that the Pitt
icers would have would be to se-
cure fina'ncial backing. The most
probable source would be the Uni-
versity Athletic Department.

Athletic Director Cas Mising-
linksi appeared to be rather opti-

easily be appropriated too. After
all, we had a-slapstick comedy
running during the fall at the sta-
dium for the last nine years, so
why not a circus.”

Or_rtesta is scheduled to meet
with Misinglinksi some time next
week to disucss the possibilities
of putting a dome over Panther
Hollow Lake and converting it into
artificial ice. «
