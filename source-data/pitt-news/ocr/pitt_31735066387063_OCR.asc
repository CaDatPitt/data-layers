-Volunteer involvement by Pitt’s
Greek system this year won’t end
with the end of Greek Week 1994,
according to members of the
Panhellenic Association.

Panhel President Kelly Reddy and
Community Service Cha§ir Kendra
Thomas discussed two volunteer
projects in which Pitt sororities and
other students can take part.

Reddy encouraged Pitt’s sorority
members to become involved
through the Pitt Student Volunteer
Action Center, a program by which
students can choose volunteer work
to suit their interests.

Reddy said the program, which is
sponsored by the Office of Student
Activities and the Commuter
Resource Center, places students into
volunteer activities and is open to all
Pitt students.

“We’re trying to encourage Greeks
to get involved, because we do a lot
of volunteer and philanthropy pro-
jects,” Reddy said.

According to Reddy, the program
gives Pitt’s Greek community a
chance to volunteer their services
through something in addition to
Greek Week.

“This one is perfect for us to get
involved in,” she said. “We’re not
only helping the community, but
we’re also gaining a great deal of

Via e-mail

Electronic mail has been hailed by
some as an on—ramp to the informa-
tion superhighway.

However, abuse of Pitt’s e-mail net-
work has turned the trip into a rough
ride for the university’s Computing
and Information Sciences
Department.

According to David L. Scliatz, assis-
tant to the director for Computing
Labs at Academic Computing, inci-
dences of offensive e-mail and other
network violations have “exploded”
since he began keeping records of
them in January of 1993.

Schatz said the number of offenses
have increased from less than 10 per
month to several dozen each month.

“It’s becoming a very serious prob-
lem,” Schatz said. “We don’t go out
looking for violations, but if someone
brings a problem to our attention, we
have to look into it.”

Schatz said illegal uses of the net-
work range from playing Multi—User
Dungeons and Dragons games, or
MUDs, which “bog down” computer

thorized accounts.
Additionally, some system users

or intimidating them racially.
“Harassment can be sexual, it can
be racial  it can take on anything
that you’d harass a person with any
other way,” Schatz said. '

vices is governed by Pitt’s Student
Code of Conduct, which prohibits

The annual race is under way
in the Oakland area. The win-
ners get the best apartment, the
losers get one year of housing
agony. Unfortunately, many
contestants have no idea where
the race begins, let alone what
obstacles lie ahead.

“You have to make sure you
get what you want and what is
important to you,” said sopho-
more Ann Pieli. “I mean, it’s for
a whole year.”

Pieli echoed the concerns of
many students who received

high lottery numbers but hoped
to live in the university dormito-
ries. She said since Pitt guaran-
teed housing to both first—year
and second-year students, she
thought that getting a dorm
room would be very unlikely.

But Department of Housing
Director Bob Hopkins said’ any
student who returned a contract
by the‘ March 15 deadline will
be able to select a room this
year, “whether [they may] be
sophomores, juniors or seniors.”

“Later on, when I found out
that finding a place would be so
difficult, I kind of wished I
would have put down the hous-
ing deposit,” Pieli said. “There
have been so many hassles
already.”

The first obstacle for many
students is finding roommates.
Donald Young, a senior who
has lived off-campus for'five
years, said he knew his room-
mates only half the time before
they shared an apartment. He
said he found several room-
mates through the Commuter
Resource Center and classified
ads.

Young said he has encoun-
tered several problems with
roommates; one roommate
moved out during the middle of
the school year. He advises that
roommates “be accommodating,
but not _too accommodating 
don’t let the other person domi-
nate the place. You live there

but assured the Pitt basketball head coaching job, according
to the Associated Press.

After resigning his post yesterday, sources report that
Willard will be announced as Paul Evans’ successor at a press
conference called by the university for today at 11 a.m.

“All I will say is that Pitt is a great situation,” Willard said.

After compiling an 81-42 mark at Western Kentucky in four
years, including a Sweet 16 appearance and a Top "20 finish
in 1993, Willard chose Pitt over Providence College after
spending the weekend in Pittsburgh.

Willard said that the only player that he would actively
recruit to come over to Pitt would be son Kevin, a walk-on
guard. Willard was supposed to be the front-runner to suc-
ceed Rick Barnes at Providence but changed his mind after
meeting with Pitt Athletic Director Oval jaynes and Pitt
Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor late last week. .

The I-Iilltoppers finished 20-11 this season, losing in the
first round of the NCAA toumament to Texas, who went to

the Sweet 16.

Pitt engineer applies learning and leadership

By Jon Hayes
Staff Writer

With avid interests in science,
community service, politics and
teaching, Pitt senior Thomas
Webster juggles a diverse array
of challenging activities.

“I just don’t like to sit around.
I’ll probably have a heart attack
someday,” Webster joked.

He was elected to the
National Association of
Engineering Student Councils as
Region 2 representative last
November at the University of
Virginia.

Region 2, one of six NAESC
regions, includes engineering
student councils from North
Carolina; Virginia; West
Virginia; Washington, D.C.;
Maryland; Pennsylvania; and
Delaware.

Webster, :1 chemical engineer-
ing student, said, “The meaning
behind [NAESC] is to gather all
engineering schools from across
the country to exchange view-
points and programs.”

Webster, who is also co-
founder of Phi Sigma Pi, an
honors fraternity, said he is cur-
rently involved in writing two
manuals for NAESC and has
been busy recruiting new stu-
dent councils to NAESC.

Last weekend he said he said
he was attending a regional
meeting at Penn State and was
hoping to recruit the University

 

 

here to help.

of Pennsylvania’s engineering
student council.

“My top priority as a region
representative is to inform my
councils in Region 2,” he said.

According to Webster, he
became involved in NAESC
through his vice presidency of
Pitt’s Engineering Student
Council.

He said, “I didn’t go into it
wanting to be this position 
but we were sitting in our
region meeting and  right in
that meeting is when I decided
that I would run for it.”

Webster said he has spent this
semester co—oping for
International Paper, a paper
manufacturer, in Erie.

“It sounds so boring, but
there are a lot of things that can
go wrong with making paper 
and a lot of engineering disci-
plines are applied,” he said of
his experience with the compa-
ny.

He said he will graduate in
the spring of 1995 after five
years of college.

“I’m very happy with my co-
op, and I could do this for the
rest of my life. But at the same
time, I am looking towards my
Master’s degree [in Bio—clrem—
istryl,” he added.

While co’-oping in Erie,
Webster said he has worked on
a committee for the March‘ of
Dimes. He said he purchased a
Diamond Back mountain bike

 

which March of Dimes will raf-
fle off for additional’ fund rais-
ing.

Webster said, “I’ve always
walked every year  but I really
wanted to do more with the
March of Dimes. I am a service-
oriented person.”

For the past two years,
Webster said, he has tutored at
Pitt’s Learning Skills Center in
the study skills department.

He said he helps students in
five main areas: time manage-
ment, textbook reading, lecture
and note-taking, memory strate-
gies and test-taking.

“It’s something I like and I
find really rewarding when you
are tutoring someone and 

their grades improve,” he said,-

which leads to another of
Webster’s interests. .

“Teaching is something else I
would like to do  whether it
be one night class or as full as
having three or four classes.”

Webster said he also donated
time helping Tom Murphy’s
mayoral candidacy.

“I was one of those annoying
guys who handed out flyers.
That was fun Ibecausell got to
go to the celebration party [elec-
tionl night,” he said.

Webster said he is “middle—of—
the—road” politically and has
tried to help Senator Arlen

Specter with his campaigns.

At the moment, Webster said
he is organizing his high school

class’ five-year reunion, because
he was class president.

Webster said he came to Pitt
as a business student but
switched to chemical engineer-
ing because he really liked sci-
ence’s challenges.

He said his father, who is a
project , engineer for
Philadelphia’s transportation
system, may have inﬂuenced his
affinity for engineering.

“He wasn’t really pressuring
me to go into it, but he’d put
subtle hints all over the place,”
Webster said.

Webster said curiosity ‘effect-
ed his decision to switch to
engineering.

“One of the reasons why I
like chemistry so much, chemi-
cal engineering and engineering
in general, is there are so many
unknowns that really interest
me. You put a flame to hydro-
gen and it will blow up. Well,
why?” he said.

Webster said he has had a
lifelong interest in the sciences.

“Growing up, I had a strong
interest in astronomy,” Webster
said.

“It’s a fascinating concept
when you think about the con-
cept that [the universel goes on
forever. It’s amazing to know
that it doesn’t end.”

“Things like that are what
really interest me and what I
want to find the answer to,” he
said.

deﬁcﬁ
disorder

By Laura Zotis
For The Pitt News

Hoping to curb learning
disabilities due to hyper-
activity in children, two
Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic doc-
tors have been awarded a
grant to study Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder.

Dr. William Pelham,
director of the ADHD
program, and his co-
investigator Dr. Betsy
Hoza were awarded a
grant of $1.5 million to
study medication treat-
ments in combination
with behavioral and edu-
cational treatments as
well as individually. The
subjects are children
between the ages of
seven and nine.

The grant was awarded
in March 1992 after a call
for proposal by the
National Institute of
Mental Health. »

The funding began in
September 1992, with the
first year of research
being spent on protocol
development.

Part of the reason that
this site was chosen for
the research was Pelham’s
research with ADHD.

He has been one of the
nation’s leading
researchers in this deficit
disorder for the past 15
years.

Americans ﬂoc/e to religion only in Crisis ,5czy5 AFSA

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

In an attempt to provide an
open discussion about atheism
and other related subjects, Pitts
Atheist and Freethought Student
Association held their first offi-
cial meeting in the Cathedral of
Learning last night.

“Religious groups try to popu-
larize their views,” AFSA
President Chris Hanson said.

"I think that people who are
nonbelievers should try to voice
their opinions and what their
position should be.”

The discussion was mostly a
criticism of religious institutions
and their lack of rationality.

When a person applies reason
to religion, said student Scott
Quay, that person is forced to
rethink their position. The ratio-

nal theist is out of line.

Atheist Quay did admit that
maybe his life is better because
of religion.

The fear of hell keeps many
people from walking down the
street shooting people, Quay
said with a laugh.

People are often made to feel
guilty by society and family
members if they don’t believe in
a God, according to AFSA Vice
President Lourie Collins.

Group members also talked
about the overwhelming pres-
ence of religion in America but
how people only flock to it in
times of crisis.

When Sinead O’Connor tore a
picture of the pope last year on
“Saturday Night Live,” everyone
all of a sudden defended the
popeeven though they proba-
bly hadn’t gone to church in

years, Quay said.

Hanson called generic
Christianity “the civic religion of
America.”

Sophomore Ben Peal, who is
a Roman Catholic, said he is

always looking for new per-.

spectives.
Peal defended his faith sever-
al times against repeated

inquiries about the Catholic
church and how it monopolized
much of Europe and its cultures
during the Middle Ages.

But after the meeting Peal
explained his defense more in
depth. '

“I defend [the Catholic
church] beliefs-system but not
as an institution,” Peal said. “As
an institution they’re not exactly
living up to their own ideals.”

Besides discussion, much of
the meeting was used to plan

for the future. Hanson said he
hopes to have some speakers
come to visit next year and have
more events, such as a bible cri-
tique.

Publications such as
Freetbozrgbt Today and Tbe
Case Against God were avail-
able to students who came to
voice their atheistic beliefs and
in some cases view their current
beliefs from a different angle.

Hanson gave one of the more
unusual suggestions for an
activity, a “Resurrection-get-

together” on Easter Sunday to

watch zombie movies.

Hanson said that if students
are interested in the group or
the subject of atheism, a table
will be set up in the lower level
of the William Pitt Union on
Wednesday to provide informa-
tion from 11 a.m. to 3: 30 p.m.

Cancer linked to abortion,

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer

Dr. Chris Kahlemborn, physician of inter-
nal medicine in Pittsburgh, spoke to the
Students for Life on campus last night about
what he believes to be a correlation
between abortion, “the pill” and the con-
traction of breast cancer.

“At first I thought it was an emotional tie-
in, so I read a pamphlet [on it]  I went
through a few of the papers,” Kahlemborn
said. “They show a pretty strong correlation
between lthe twol.”

During a woman’s first pregnancy, her
estrogen levels “go off the scale” during the

first trimester, according to Kahlemborn.

In terms of women getting breast cancer
after their first pregnancy, the results are not
as clear-cut. According to Kahlemborn,
there are conflicting studies as to whether
breast cancer levels rise, fall or stay the
same after a woman’s first pregnancy.

According to Kahlemborn, the American
Medical Association and the media are both
very pro-abortion and have been trying to
suppress this information. “As long as [the
AMAl'and the media keep quiet, they can
get away with it,” he said. .

Kahlemborn described a plan of his to
ensure that doctors can no longer plead
ignorance to these findings inthe future.

suggests pro-life advocate

“I can't tell you exactly what it is, but it
involves certified mail. It's tragic that you
have to do this to get proof that people
know what’s going on,” he said.

As a second part of the plan, letters will
be sent out to presently-unnamed members
and organizations in the medical communi-
ty to spread the awareness of the abortion-
breast cancer connection.

Stephany Pritchett, SFL p.r. director,said
she thinks it is important for women to
make a truly-informed decision before they
have an abortion. “People know the risks of
smoking cigarettes, yet they still do it,”
Pritchett said.“I think that some women will
change their minds.”

computer facilities from being
used for non-research or non-
academic purposes and the
harassment of others.

“The code is all common
sense,” Schatz said “Those
[guidelines in the code] are all
very general, reasonable con-
straints.”

According to Schatz,
Academic Computing has
recently been dealing with an
onslaught of electronic chain
letters. The letters demand
recipients to forward them to
other users or else face some
sort of misfortune.

“It is against the university’s
policy to forward chain letters,”
Schatz said. “People just don’t
want to receive them — they’re
junk mail, they tie up the sys-
tem, and they tie up people’s
disks until they are deleted.”

Another item of concern for
Academic Computing, Schatz
said, is the content of finger
plans, files in which users post

information about themselves
and usually a short message to
other users which can be
accessed by calling up some-
one’s network authorization
account.

Schatz said users occasionally
find these messages to be very
offensive or degrading.

“We don’t go out of our way
to go after loffensivel finger
plans,” Schatz said.

“But if a user finds a finger
plan to be offensive, we will
notify the [owner] of this and
they can be taken to the Judicial
Board.”

Schatz said the issue of free-
dom of speech is taken into
account when offensive finger
plans are brought to Academic
Computing’s attention, but poli-
cies regarding questionable e-
mail are more strict.

“They can put out whatever
they want to [on finger plans]
and if it offends someone that’s
between those two individuals,”
Schatz said. “E-mail, however, is

directed at a person. If that per-
son finds it threatening or

harassing, that's their right to A

ldo sol.”

“A finger plan is something
that you ask for,” he added.
“But we will take action against
e-mail, because it’s directed at
an individual.”

Schatz said Academic
Computing does discipline
owners of finger plans which
violate federal laws, such as one
plan file which referred to solic-
iting sex with minors.

“That’s against federal, state
and county law, and we did
take action against that one,”
Schatz said.

According to Schatz, most of
the action taken by Academic
Computing involves him send-
ing an e-mail warning to users
accused of offending others. He
said the warning works in most
cases, though sometimes viola-
tors do not stop with their first
offense.

“We’ll suspend the account in
order to get the [repeat offend-
er] to come in,” Schatz said.
“This is usually done when we
suspect the person using an
account isn’t the person who
owns it.”

Schatz also said people who
offend other users twice are
referred to Pitt’s Judicial Board.
Cases regarding e-mail harass-
ment can also be taken to court
if complainants choose to do so.

“I know of at least two cases
where complainants took it to_
court, under a general harass-
ment charge,” Schatz said. “[The
case] can be taken to civil court
or criminal court, and it can be
upheld.”

Because Pitt system users can
access worldwide networks
such as Internet, offensive e-
mail can affect the university on
a tremendous scale, according
to Schatz. ‘

“What is really critical about

-this is that if [Pitt] fails to control

its people and if they start
harassing people outside the
university, we could have our
Internet access turned off,”
Schatz said.

“That would be a death blow
to a world-class university such
as Pitt,” he added.

Schatz said e-mail violators
pose a huge headache for the
people who have to investigate
their offenses.

“Every time I have to handle
one of these cases, it involves

ed with the program in
September 1995 and is assisting
Pelham in his research.
“ADHD is one of the most
‘common childhood disorders
lthat parents end up seeking
help from mental health ser-

l vices for. This disorder affects 3
to 9 percent of children nation-
wide,” said Shapiro.

There are three different pro-
: grams under the behavioral and
‘educational treatments for chil-
ldren. They are: parent training,

child—focused summer treatment
programs and school consulta-
,tion.

If the children are between

jthe ages of five and 15, they are
eligible for the child-focused
summer treatment program.

The summer treatment pro-
gram runs from the end of June
to the middle of Augmst. It is an
eight-week program that runs
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday.

The program will test 48 chil-
dren between the ages of seven
and nine in two groups.

The first group is to start in '

May of this year, and the second
will begin in the early part of
1995.

The researchers will be
actively recruiting subjects for
the first program until the end
of April. The program will last
14 months.

After the 14-month period
ends, the study ends for these
subjects until May of 1996.

Then the subjects will come
back for a follow-up eval-
uauon.

To register a child for this
study or to inquire about any
other programs in ADHD for
children, call Shapiro at 624-

Martin, at 624-4270.

knowledge and experience from volun-
teering.”’

Thomas discussed Panhel’s upcoming
involvement in the United Cerebral Palsy
phone-a—thon which will beheld April 5-
7. _ . ..

According to Thomas, sorority mem-
bers will be arranged in match groups,
suchas those in Greek Week blood dri-
ves, and will solicit prospective donors

to UCP during the phone telethon.

Money raised will go toward the fund-
ing of programs and services for cerebral
palsy patients. p

Thomas said Pitt Greeks’ past success-
es with the UCP charity led tolthis year’s
volunteer project.

“[lJCP] said they liked working with
Pitt students a lot,” Thomas said. “We
donated a lot of money to them two
years ago with Greek Week, and they

thought we could help them again."
This year’s Greek Week netted
approximately $102,000 for Special
Olympics. Thomas said no specific goal
has been set for the amount of money to
raise for UCP, but that the effort to vol-
unteer is‘ the major goal of the program.
C“I didn’t "discuss the money issue
[when planning the project] because I
thought volunteering was a little more
important,” Thomas said. “I think it’s

important that we are out in the commu-
nity and that UCP did think of us for this
lprojectl.”

Panhel notes:

-Induction of the Order of Omega and

too.”

He said when problems arise,
he works out problems by con-
fronting people.

“I wouldn’t recommend that
friends move in together,”
Young said. “I think that 95 per-
cent of the time, friends who
move in together stay friends,
but when they move out, they
aren’t as close.” ’

Senior Tonya jakubowski also
said that friends do not always
make the best roommates. “Just
make sure that you’re compati-
ble and you know what it will
be like to live with that person.”

Pieli said she had to be

should make up “want lists”
about the type of apartment
they seek and the rights they
expect from other roommates,

One stop where apartment-
hunters can find information
and guidance is the Commuter
Resource Center in the William
Pitt Union.

The office provides-a com-
plete “renter’s checklist” which
should be answered before
signing a lease.

Other materials include a
table of average rent prices in
different areas of Pittsburgh, a
partial list of city real estate
companies, maps and a guide-
book to off-campus housing.

According to Hopkins, there
are some important -questions
all apartment hunters should
ask of all realtors andlandlords.
The type of security in the
building is important in an
urban area such as Pittsburgh,
and different services are
offered depending on the real-
tor.

For example, A.R. Building
Company said it has a guaran-
teed random security patrol for
its buildings on Melwood
Avenue.

Glickman Realty, which owns
more than 40 units in South
Oakland, secures its buildings
with a variety of locks, accord-

ing to employee Cheryl
Buchewicz.

Another important question
sometimes overlooked is how
accessible the landlord or
owner is to the tenants.
Jakubowski said when she and
her roommates wanted to ques-
tion the owner about why their
rent was higher than others
renting the same size apartment,
they were told they were not
allowed to know who owned
the apartment.

“But they told us we could
write letters," she said. “We
ended up going to the lawyer at
the Student Government Board
office to find out what we could
do about it."

Hopkins said the Commuter
Resource Center is also a good
starting point for students with
legal questions. ‘‘It’s hard for
students to find out what their
rights are.”

lTomorrow: \Y/hat are your
rights when problems arisc-?l

The most
complete
arsenal of test

straightforward with her friends

to find out who her roommates
would be.

"I confronted people and
insisted on definite answers,”
Pieli said.

Once the roommate question
is settled, students must togeth-
er pursue the common goal:
finding an apartment that satis-
fies eveiyone’s needs.

Hopkins said roommates

 OF3PITI'Sl3_URGI-IA:

 

Keep e-mail appropriate

If you are like a lot of the other students wandering
Pitt’s campus in search of an education, you probably
occasionally do some of that searching in the computer
labs. While there, however, not all students are so
focused on academic work, some becoming a kind of
computer troll. They want to communicate with the
world, make friends and find intelligent life out there.

However, what is happening is that students are
threatening others, making enemies and proving their
own ignorance. Inappropriate use of E-mail ranges
from playing multi-user Dungeons and Dragons games
to racial intimidation. ‘

There have been attempts to deal with such things as
chain letters and multi-user games because they slow
down the system by clogging it with useless informa-
tion. The other problems that have come to the fore-
front "of attention are offensive finger plans (which
allow users to post information on themselves and a
short message other users can access if they call up
someone’s network account) and threatening or offen-
sive messages. I

Academic Computing generally does not search for
offensive plans, nor for harassing messages, but if
someone complains, they look into the complaint. With
finger plans, the issue of freedom of speech is taken
into account. According to David Schatz, assistant to
the director for Academic Computing, if a finger plan
offends someone, it is between the two individuals in
question because “a finger plan is something you ask
for.” (Those with finger plans which violate laws, such
as one which referred to soliciting sex with minors,
will have actions‘ taken against them.) Action will be
taken against harassing E-mail because it is directed at
a specific user. The first step is for Academic
Computing to send a message to the user saying that
their behavior is inappropriate. To the credit of most
users, this usually solves the problem. However, the
judicial board can become involved, which is essential
as it will make people accountable for what they do
and show that they can be traced. Another possibility is
the suspension of the account, which should happen to
people using them for nefarious purposes.

These kind of messages can result in Pitt being cut
off from the Internet. Thus, action must be taken as
soon as itis established that there is a problem.

Students should remember that if they receive offen-
sive or harassing messages they should not attempt to
respond in kind, but instead contact Schatz at 624-4721
and allow him to follow up on the complaint.

It is excellent timing on the part of university officials
to address harassment now, before it becomes an epi-
demic. Students should contribute to this by reporting
the incidents as soon as they happen.

Actions of few can't convict all

Ahhhh, as last week’s balmy
springlike breezes whipped my
womanly, luxurious hair into a
tantalizing frenzy, my
Wednesday was made even
brighter by what looked like
the overnight chalk scrawlings
by queer folks.

Sketched on sidewalks and
walls were sayings such as “I’m
gay and I babysit,” and “My sis-
ter is queer too.”

It just so happens that last
week was BGLAD, or
“Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Days.”

BiGALA, the Bisexual Gay
and Lesbian Alliance, spon-

sored two information tables, a .
safer sex workshop and Gay .

jeans Day.

The queer staff and faculty
organization, with the support
of the Pennsylvania Council on
the Humanities, brought John
D’Emilio — a gay social theo-
rist and University of North
Carolina instructor — to Pitt.

With all this queer liberation

in the spring air, someone (or ‘

some people) took it upon
themselves to chalk _a couple of
sidewalks around the Pitt cam-
pus.

In response to these impish
pranks, I found in The Pitt
News yesterday two opinions
addressing the perceived sever-
ity of these chalkings. The
were written by a couple of
guys who were sure that they
knew who had done it, and
why. H

And these ideas are not con-
fined to the pages of a campus
newspaper.

There is a popular body of
thought that imagines all gay,

lesbian and bisexual people-

sharing the same political aspi-

- rations and beliefs.

By the same act of general-
ization, all gay men act femi-
nine, all lesbians like power
tools and bisexuals just can’t
make up their minds.

M. Thomas Carter, author of ‘

yesterdays opinion/editorial,
called gay activists “social

annoyances,” likening the
chalkers’ actions to attention-
seeking juvenile delinquents. A

In a letter to editor, Brian
Potoski unfoundedly charged
BiGALA, as a group, with
breaking the law, and he
warned that this alleged behav-
ior warrants “punishment.”

Pitt’s BiGALA is not home to
every last queer activist or gay,
lesbian and bisexual student at
the University of Pittsburgh for
that matter. There are dozens
of queer groups in Pittsburgh
and thousands of queer and
queer-supporting students at
l’lt[.

Yet some people cannot

Megan
Hickey

imagine a politically and social-
ly varied queer community and
therefore assume that BiGALA
must be, as a group, responsi-
ble for the chalkings that
occurred last week.

In fact, any queer events at “

Pitt are usually attributed to
BiGALA regardless of the
group’s actual involvement. 9

BiGALA as a student organi-
zation does not condone van-
dalism, but it is also not
responsible for actions of mem-
bers or anyone else of the
activist persuasion.

By the logic demonstrated by
Potoski and others, former
KKK Grand Wizard and 1991
Louisiana Republican guberna-
torial candidate, David Duke
speaks for all Republicans,
Putting people into boxes does
nothing but limit our under-
standing of each other as indi-
viduals with unique beliefs and
goals.

Carter’s opinion is that the
intention of those who chalked
the sidewalks was to further
gays’ “efforts to be treated

equally as responsible adults
and citizens.”

By delinquently chalking, it
is suggested that gays are less-
ening their chances of being
“granted” equality.

I don’t feel that the actions of
a few particular activists should
be used as an argument for or
against gays’ and lesbians’ non-
discriminatory treatment as a
group of citizens and humans.

This is another example of
the absurd charging of respon-
sibility of the actions of a few
to an entire community of peo-
ple.

Men constitute 95 percent of
the state prison population
according to the United States
Justice Department.

Should all men therefore be
incarcerated for the crimes of a
few?

And speaking of activism.
those “radicals” certainly went
all out this time.

Picture this on the D-Day of
the chalking — an army of rad-
ically inclined militant homo-
sexual/bisexual activists. reel-
ing from the stinging ban from
the ROTC, decide to take inat-
ters into their own hands.

The sense of existential
emptiness that they felt from
being denied the experience. of
crawling on their bellies in
camouflage with an automatic
riﬂe led them to don fatigues
and take to the Cathedral lawn
bearing the most deadly
weapon of all  CHALK!

I guess they hoped that their
politically powerful chalking
would catch the eye of
Attorney General Janet Reno
and prompt some federal civil
rights protection for gays and
lesbians.

Their hopes dissolved into
the afternoon rain.

These debates are not about
the chalker’s tomfoolery. A
healthy queer who comes out
seems to strike fear in the
hearts of many students.

nyone who knows any-

thing about sports will tell

you that for a team to be
successful and contend for
championships, there must be
role—players to support the
team’s superstars.

As everyone
is seeing this
season, the
Chicago Bulls
were more
than just a
o n e - m a n

show with Michael Jordan. The
role-players did their jobs to
support Jordan and help
Chicago win.

Mario Lemieux never could
win games by himself, let alone
an NHL championship, until the
emergence of some key role-
players.

The Pittsburgh Penguins had
role—players in their two Stanley
Cup victories. Players such as
Phil Bourque, Randy Gilhen
and Troy Loney all contributed
to the Penguins’ success.

The muckers and grinders, as
they’re sometimes called, play a
vital role in a hockey team’s
success.

Play defense, kill penalties
and score the occasional goal
are the usual prerequisites to
being a role—player.

With all of the before-men-I

tioned players now gone, the
Penguins went out into the free-
agent jungle this past off—season
to try to find a suitable replace-
ment. They found such a player
in Doug Brown. .

Brown came to the Pens dur-
ing the off—season after having

spent his entire career with the
New Jersey Devils.

With the Devils, Brown spent
most of his career playing on
the third and fourth lines and
developing a reputation as a top
defensive, and I stress the word
defensive, forward.

Brown rarely played with any
offensively-gifted centers and
wingers, so his primary role was
to help keep the puck from
finding the back of the net.

When his contract expired,
Brown went looking for greener
pastures, his stay in New Jersey
had worn thin.

Other teams in the NHL
offered Brown guaranteed con-
tracts. GMs are always looking
for good defensive forwards.

Brown declined the offers in
hopes of catching on with the
Penguins, a team he felt was a
serious Stanley Cup contender.

With their glut of talent at the
right wing, the best the
Penguins would offer would be
a non-guaranteed contract —e in
essence, a tryout.

Brown accepted the offer and

hasn’t looked back since.

Coming aboard the Penguins’
ship, Brown knew his ice time

Sorry kids, I finally decided to
clean my desk. Most of you
don't know how bad that is —
believe rue, your blissful igno-
rance is best here.

Let’s see. What’s here? 
Wow, the story on the realign-
ment of the divisions in Major
League Baseball.

Did San Francisco manager ,
Dusty Baker ‘design this system?
The‘Giants, who won 103
games last year, have only the
Los Angeles Dodgers, San
Diego Padres and Colorado
Rockies to contend with.

The Dodgers seem to have
the old minor-league system
cranking up into high gear, but
the fact that they are still waiting
for Darryl Strawberry to come
around disqualifies the men
who bleed Dodger blue.

The Rockies’ pitching was
worse than the Pirates last year.

‘ Enough said. The Padres are the

best team no money can buy. In
other words, they stink.
If the Giants don't win the

West this year, maybe Baker
can convince the baseball pow-
ers-that-be to let his team play
against little leaguers next year.
Baseball purists cried out for
the death of the pennant race.
How about the fact that we are
almost guaranteed of having to
see Barry Bonds in the playoffs
again? I can’t bear to watch.
Maybe they could just give
Bonds the regular season off,
and try to convince him it’s

Back to cleaning. What else
do we have here? Hey, I
remember that sandwich. I
don’t remember it looking like
that, though. I wondered what
that smell was. I thought some-
thing had died.

Here’s another note on the
Giants — signing former

Houston right—hander Mark
Portugal to bolster their pitching
staff. Here’s my bet for the free
agent ﬂop of the year.

Portugal has lived off playing
his home games in the
Astrodome, where he was 10-1
last season (18—4 overall). His
career ERA at home is 2.58, but
he has struggled away from the
dome. His team will win him
some games, but he’ll be lucky
to break even this season.

Breaking even  what if I
only clean half of the desk?
Guess not. Turn on the radio
while I work on this. Please, no
sports news. I already heard
that Denny Neagle is probably
going to start the third game of
the season for the Pirates,
against the Giants no less.

Maybe he’ll pitch against
Portugal, so we can have a
slugfest. Neagle versus Barry
Bonds, Matt Williams, Robby
Thompson, etc.  remember
how ridiculous that idea of the
Giants versus little leaguers
sounded?

This past weekend, the Pitt
men’s tennis team travelled
east to Penn State to take on
the Nittany Lions. Pitt played
a good match but lost to the
powerful team from PSU 6-1.

“Penn State is a strong
team,” Pitt head coach George
Dieffenbach said. “We played
very well, and the match was
very close.”

The lone victory of the day
for the Panthers came from
Braden Doherty, who defeat-
ed the top-ranked Lion, Greg
Gaunt, by a score of 6-2, 6-4.
Gaunt came in witl1 a big

serve, but the strong ground-
stokes of Doherty forced
many errors and kept Gaunt
on the defensive.

“Braden’s victory was the

best victory I've seen in tennis
in the 18 years I’ve been
coaching,” Dieffenbach said.
Other Pitt singles competi-
tors matches were not so suc-
cessful as Doherty. Brad
Wade lost to Mike Carter (6-4,
6-2); James Chronister was
defeated by Chad Skorupka
(6-2, 6-0); Jeff Campbell lost
to Chris Cahill (6-4, 6-3),
Doug Schoenly defeated
Panther Dave Dumpel (6-0, 6-
2); and Matt Mills lost to Mike
Tain (6-2, 6-4). With a lot of 6-

N ittany Lions Wax tennis, 6-1

4 sets, the Panthers stayed
close but lost very tight
matches.

A service break here or
there and the final score
would have been different.

In doubles action, the Lions
swept the Panthers 3-0. Gaunt
and Spinner defeated Doherty
and Wade (8-5). Chronister
and Campbell lost to Carter
and Schoenly (6-0, 6-2); and
in the third match Dumpel
and Chris McShane lost to
Brett Pollack and Marc
Dimino (8-1).

Pitt’s record now stands at
6-8 going into Wednesday’s
match with Youngstown State

Stevens All-Conference
for women's gymnastics

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

This past weekend, the
women’s gymnastics team sent
four of its members to compete
at the ECAC championships
held at the University of
Vermont.

Brenda Stevens was named to
the All-Conference team and
finished third in the balance
beam with a career-high score
of 9.65, which was also fourth
on the
Pitt.

“Brenda did a great job,” head
coach Debbie Yohman said.

“She probably would have
placed in the all-around, but her
floor [exercise] was still watered
down due to an injury. She still
had four solid
events.”

Stevens’ scores were a 9.20 on
vault, a 9.425 on uneven bars, a
9.125 on floor and the afore-
mentioned 9.65 on balance
beam.

Her total all—around score was
57.40.

“I am really excited about
beam,” Stevens said.

“I also thought that my bars
was the best I had all
year”

Stevens will be competing in
NCAA regionals on April 9 at
Rhode Island.

She says she is excited about
that, but right now she is hop-

all—time list at.

ing her ankle injury will heal
and allow her to do more diffi-
cult routines. '

Also competing in the 

around for the Lady Panthers

was Robyn Senior. She scored a‘,

total of 36.35.

Her highest score came on ’

vault where she received a

9.575. Senior scored a 9.25 on _

bars, an 8.75 on beam and an
8.975 on floor.

“Robyn had an off day,”
Yohman said.

“It was tough on the girls not
having a team there to back
them up.”

This statement was repeated
by the other Lady Panther com-
petitors. V

Lori Buck competed on floor
(8.8), bars (9.15) and beam
(9.15), and Christine'Battista
competed on vault (9.0).

“I had an average day, but it
was hard to compete without a
team,” Buck said.

“I felt I did good, but without
a team there it was hard to com-
pete,” Battista said.

The season is over for the
Lady Panthers, but for Brenda
Stevens there is one more com-
petition to accomplish what she
wants to.

If the injured ankle heals.
Stevens may have a chance to
do what she has only dreamed

about — win a trip to
NCAA nationals later this

Continued from page 7
that, is that Neagle had minor-
league success as a starter, so if
the Bucs are going to use him,
they’d better use him as a
starter. Remember Randy
Tomlin, you know, the guy bat-
tling Scott Scudder for the ﬁfth
spot. He had success as a starter
in the major leagues.

Besides, letting Neagle start
gives him even more innings in
which to get pounded.

Okay, okay  back to clean-
ing. Here’s_ a more recent paper.
The LA. Clippers beat the
Atlanta Hawks 97-94 last week.
Interesting upset with some
serious justice.
= Dominique Wilkins returned
to Atlanta for the first time since
the Hawks traded him and a
first-round pick to the Clippers
for Danny Manning. Wilkins
scored 36 to help down the
Hawks while Manning scored
only six points and spent most
of the game on the bench with
foul trouble.

I don’t care if Manning does
fit in better with Atlanta’s sys-
tem, ‘Nique did what was asked
and the Hawks are making the
most legitimate run they’ve had
at a title in his career and they
dump him. Wilkins should have
been able to finish his career in
Atlanta.

Just in case anybody cares,
Wilkins was averaging 51 points
per game compared to only 14
per game by Manning through
last Friday in games since the
trade.

No, I am not going to throw
that away.

It’s today’s paper. I haven’t
even read about Magic
Jolinson’s first game as coach of
the Lakers.

USA Today ran an interesting
quote from the Magic man.

“The problem is, in a moment
like this, you wish you could
play.”

The problem for the Lakers is
that he won’t.

Will y’all please let me do the
discarding. I know that story is
from last week. I want to keep
it. Reading about criticism of
The Pitt News sports section

makes me feel very appreciated.

For the readers who missed it,
track star Mary Allison Williams
said that the women’s track
team does not get the respect it
deserves, particularly from this
newspaper.

My personal opinion; with all
due respect to Williams’ accom-
plishments on the track, she is

way out of line. There are plen-
ty of people to pick on for not
respecting women’s athletics at
Pitt, and those criticisms are
more justified.

Take Pitt sports fans who
never went to any non-revenue
athletic events, including
women’s events, and who have
missed out.

OK, my experience before
college was one women’s high
school basketball game I
watched on a particularly bor-
ing evening. I didn’t even know
Pitt volleyball was a women’s
team when I took the beat as I
started my first year at the uni-
versity.

Over four years, three of them
spent covering that volleyball
team and the women’s basket-
ball team, I have learned one
thing.

Female athletes don’t need
sports writers to give them
respect as a part of some gender
equity issue.

They don’t need us to give
them anything. They are earn-
ing the respect by being big-
time college athletes.

Apparently, most of you don’t
know that.

The women’s basketball team
averaged only 375 fans per
game this season, and the other
women’s teams didn’t even
draw that well.

Those fans have missed out.
A large number of Pitt’s top ath-
letes over the last four years at
Pitt were women, such as All-
Americans Kristen Brown in
gymnastics, Williams, Najuma
Fletcher and Kim Blair in track
and Ann Marie Lucanie in vol-
leyball.

The four seniors who finished
their Pitt women’s basketball
careers this past weekend were
part (along with redshirt junior
Jenine Joyce) of the kind of
recruiting class that you can
build a program on. The next
time all—Big East forward _Ionna
Huemrich ties on the sneakers
for real, if she does again, it will
be in a pro league overseas, not
just up the hill.

Huemrich has been a stand-

out, but for consistent star pro-

duction over the past four years,
Lucanie is the best I’ve seen
here.

From being part of Pitt’s first
NCAA tournament win as a
rookie to being the program’s
first All-American when she
made the second team as a
senior, “Am” was arguably the
best sports performer at Pitt the

last four years.

And y’all missed her.

I am making some headway
in the cleaning. I can’t even
identify the really disgusting
stuff any more. Wait a minute
 Oh my 

Maybe it is time to stop
checking out the stuff on my
desk.

Did you hear that, unofficially
of course, super-talented, super-
raw George Washington center
Yinka Dare is taking the early
exit for the NBA right now
while Glenn Robinson of
Purdue may be staying in the
college ranks for another sea-
son.

Dare is passing on some
much-needed time to develop.
Robinson, on the other hand, is
plenty developed. In fact, it isn’t
even fair to let him play with
college players anymore.

jokes aside, Robinson
deserves some serious respect if
he passes on the chance to be
the top pick overall to finish up
in school.

Speaking of respect, if any-
body can finish this cleaning,
they will earn mine.

I think I need a sandblaster.

penalty-killers for this team,
filling in for Mario Lemieux
and giving breathers to Ron
Francis and Joe Mullen-.

The surprising aspect of
Brown’s game has been his
offensive production this
season. Brown has already
set career highs in both goals
and assists this season.
Brown has chalked up 18
goals and 37 assists and is a
plus-19 for the season so far.

Brown spends consider-
able time on a line centered
by Martin Straka and even
puts in minutes on the
Penguin power play.

Despite his newfound
offensive output, Brown is

‘ reluctant to call himself a

goalscorer.
“I just show up every

-night, you guys [the medial

have to put labels on peo-
ple,” Brown said.

Brown denied being wor-
ried about losing playing
time when the Pens acquired
Shawn McEachern and
Tomas Sandstrom.

“All I can do is show up at
the rink and let the chips fall
where they may,” Brown
said.

That may be pretty safe if
head coach Eddie Johnston
knows the importance of
role- players. Doug Brown
has proven to be one of the
best this season for the Pens.

THE PI’IT NEWS, Tuesday, March 29, 1994

Giants have cakewalk in pathetic National League West

Giants’ Bonds National Leage MVP as San Fran ride repeat performances by Burkett and Swift to Western hijacking

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staf/‘N Writer

A new baseball season is
ready to begin, whether it’s still
snowing in Pittsburgh or not.
Realignment has taken place
and made the National League
West one of the weakest divi-
sions in baseball. The San
Francisco Giants will coast to
the title, while the Dodgers,
Rockies and Padres try to
keep their heads above water.

With the Atlanta Braves and
their obnoxious chop gone to
the Eastern division, the San
Francisco Giants have it
made. Barry Bonds and compa-
ny will make it to the playoffs
this year (sorry Pirates fans and
Bonds-haters).

Pitching in the Bay Area is as

solid as anywhere this year.
John Burkett (22-7) and Bill
Swift (21-8) should be able to
repeat their numbers of a year
ago.

Free agent acquisition Mark
Portugal, along with Bryan
Hickerson and rookie Salomon
Torres, make this staff tough to
beat. In the bullpen, no one was
better last year than closer Rod
Beck. He successfully saved 48
of 52 attempts a year ago. If the
starters can get to the eighth or
ninth, inning, it’s all over.

The infield in San Fran has a
big hole to fill this season. Will
Clark signed with Texas, leaving
manager Dusty Baker pinning
his hopes on veteran Todd
Benzinger or rookie phenom J.
R. Phillips. Benzinger will prob-
ably open the season there. The

rest of the infield will remain
the same: Robby Thompson at
second, Royce Clayton at short,
Matt Williams at third and Kurt
Manwaring behind the plate.

The outfield is led by All-
Everything left fielder Barry
Bonds. This guy is the best in
the league, bar none. Darren
Lewis (center field) and Willie
McGee (right field) will shore
up the outfield for Baker. With
this kind of lineup, put your
money on the Giants to win the
West. .
I pick the Los Angeles
Dodgers second but cautiously.
They could roll over and‘die in
this weak division. Don’t look
over your shoulder Tommy
Lasorda, the Colorado Rockies
are not that far behind.

The Dodger pitching staff is

respectable but not outstanding.
Starters Pedro Astacio, Ramon
Martinez, Orel Hershiser, Tom
Candiotti and Kevin Gross are
durable, but there are no 20-
game winners here. This is one
reason there will be no post-
season action in L.A. The
bullpen has too many holes to
be of any help. Todd Worrell
(washed up), Jim Gott (can’t
pitch in the clutch) and Roger
McDowell (too old) lead a
downright awful relief
corps.

The one bright spot for the
Dodgers is catcher Mike‘ Piazza.
If Piazza can fend off the
“sophomore jinx,” this Rookie
of the Year in 1993 could battle
for MVP honors in ‘94. Eric
Karros (first base), Delino
DeShields (second base), short-

stop Jose Offerman and a pla-
toon of Tim Wallach or Dave
Hanson at third round out the
diamond.

The outfield in L.A. reads like
a nursing home register. Darryl
Strawberry, Brett Butler and
Cory Snyder are all over 31 and
have seen better days. Rookies
Billy Ashley and Raul Mondesi
should see playing time this
year.

Tommy Lasorda has been in
Los Angeles for a long, long
time, but the management and
fans are getting restless. This
may be Lasorda’s swan
song.

Andres Galarraga cannot be
expected to repeat the phenom-
enal year he had last season for
the Colorado Rockies, but he
should still do great. Charlie
Hayes had a good season in ‘93
and has shed 11 pounds, which
will help him in the long run.
Walt Weiss and Roberto Mejia

,make up the rest of the infield.

In the outfield Dante Bichette
is joined by free agent acquisi-
tions Ellis Burks and Howard
Johnson. Getting away from
New York is the best thing HoJo
could have done.

Pitching is the biggest prob-
lem for the Rockies. Armando
Reynoso, Greg Harris and David
Nied are the only recognizable
names here. The relief will be
by the committee of Darren
Holmes, Steve Reed, Willie Blair
and Marvin Freeman.

If the Rockies hitters keep hit-
ting the ball hard and their
pitchers learn to keep the ball
down, the Rockies will give
their big following something to
cheer about. _

Last place, and no other way
to look at it, is written all across
the travel bags for the San
Diego Padres. Andy Benes and
Tony Gwynn will be gone by
season’s end. Benes is a quality
starter for anybody, and Gwynn
will be‘ acquired by a pennant
hopeful to shore up a
lineup.

After Benes, the Padres have
no pitching. The likes of Scott
Sanders, Andy Ashby, Gene
Harris and Pedro Martinez are
going to have a long year.

Brad Ausmus has taken over
the catching duties. First base
should be ‘played by Dave
Staton, Bip Roberts returns at
second, Ricky Gutierrez mans
short and Archi Cianfrocco
takes over third.

Tony Gwynn hit .358 last
year, and nobody noticed.
Tony, its not your fault. Phil
Plantier and Derek Bell join the
parade in left and center respec-
tively.

Don’t kid yourself, San Diego
is going nowhere fast. The
potential is there, but the Padres
will not contend for a long
time.

Well, there it is folks, your
National League West preview.
San Francisco will win but, hey,
I’m no magician for stating that.
It is no contest in the West. The
Giants make the playoffs, Barry
Bonds will choke and he'll
probably win another MVP tro-
phy.
