The City ofPit1sburgh has laimched a

prone to potholes than other cities in
warmer regions.
Since2006,0aklandhasissued436
requests forpothole repairs, Pittsburgh
PublicWorl<s directorRob Kaczorowski
said. Some areas, such as Shadyside,
have only reported two pothole com-
plaints —while other neighborhoods,
such as Brookline, have reported 639.
The range in the amountof pot-
holes reported in each neighborhood
depends uponthe amount oftraﬂicﬂow

he said. The total number of complaints

Kaczorowski said he doesn’t know
the numberofpothole-repair requests
the city has received or how many pot-
holes the city ﬁlled this year.

The city of Pittsburgh maintains
about1,800 miles ofroad,Kaczorowski
said. The only road that Pittis responsi-

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said. The
city’s six maintenance divisions are
responsible for handling the pothole-
patching requests that are received in
their areas.

As the pavement ages, the asphalt

to that of an alligators back.”

In the spring, as water seeps
through the fatigued surface, the un-
derlying granular layers of the pave
ment soften and additional cracking
occurs on the surface. The force from
tires causes piecesto break lose. When
these pieces come out, it opens up a
largerareaofthepavementsurface and
exacerbates the situation, thus forming
apothole, Vandenbossche said.

The city installs roadway gutters
and asphalt curbs along the sides of
the road to help water drain off the
pavement before it seeps beneath the
surface. During the summer months,
maintenance crews use a hot asphalt
mix to patch the potholes. But in the
winter, a cold patch is used instead,
sinceahot asphaltmixcannotbe made.
The cityis stillusing cold patches asthe

Pennsylvania considers taxing textbooks

Megan Kelly
For The Pitt News

A proposed change in Pennsyl-
vania sales tax could save college
students a few dollars on their
school supplies and McDonald’s
meals — but the tax will hurt stu-
dents when buying other essen—
tials, like textbooks.
Pennsylvania’s 6 percent sales
tax applies to most purchases,
but exempts necessities such
as unprepared food purchased
at a grocery store, apartment
rent and utilities. The sales tax
in Allegheny County stands at
7 percent and in Philadelphia,
it’s 8 percent. Gov. Ed Rende1l’s
proposed budget would lower

the state sales tax to 4 percent, ,

Allegheny County’s sales tax to
5 percent and Philadelphia’s to
6 percent.

State representative Jake
Wheatley, D—Hill District, said
the house will vote on the change
to the ﬁscal code in June, if it
votes at all.

Sales tax would be lower, broadened

Taxes 4 4

“We have a sales tax that was
created in 1960, and most of the
things that people were purchas-
ing in 1960 were tangible items,”
John Raymond, revenue analyst
for Pa. Sen. Jay Costa, D—Forest
Hills, said. “But now the economy
is different. Now people buy a
lot more services, [especially]
in America. We purchase the ser-
vices of a lawyer, or music from
the Internet.”

Rendell’s proposition is to do
away with 74 of the tax exemp-
tions that currently exist —— in-
cluding the one on utilities —
and use the extra revenue for two
purposes.

Raymond said the ﬁrst pur-
pose for this is to reduce the rate
on goods from 6 to 4 percent, and

_ the second is to put the money

into a special fund which would
provide the state government
with money when it loses its
stimulus bill.

Rendell’s budget still exempts
unprepared food, prescription
drugs and clothing. V

But Rendell also proposes re-

moving a tax exemption on col-
lege textbooks. His proposition
would add 4 percent to the cost of
every textbook students buy.
Pennsylvania is not the first
state to consider taxing_text-
books. Alabama taxes them -
although the Alabama state leg-

Laureni Kyle:

a tax exemption to textbooks,
according to Barnes & Noble’s
website.

Other newly taxed items would
include candy and gum, newspa-
pers and magazines, over—the-
counter drugstore items, ‘coin-
operated vending machines and

“I would say [the change]
would not bother me too much,”
Pitt junior Katie Barbera said. “I
don’t buy magazines, andll don’t
chew gum very much.”

Some students, including Bar-
bera, said the 5 percent increase
in theprice of certain materials

...It would botherme a lot, the textbook tax in

particular, because I spend so much on them

already.

islature is considering a bill to
remove the tax. ,

The proposed bill says that
“existing law does not address or
place limits on the rising prices
of college and university text-
books.” V .

Only nine other states —— in-
cluding Massachusetts, Con-
necticut and N ewjersey — apply

basic cable television. .

This means that, for exam-
ple, if a student spends $20 per
month on candy and gum in Al-
legheny County, he would pay $21
per month, which is an extra $12
per year.

Pitt students expressed mixed
opinions about the proposed
sales tax change.

would not make enough of a dif-
ference in their budgets to deter

them from purchasing certain .
_items.

"Others, like junior Lauren
Kyle, disagreed.

“I would say that it would
bother me a lot, the textbook
tax in particular, because I spend
so much on them already,” said

Kyle.

Kyle thought if a tax were im-
posed on textbooks, she would
consider changing where she
buys her books.

Other students said that if a
tax were imposed on textbooks,
they would be more likely to turn
to Amazon or another website for
books rather than the University
Book Center.

In his annual budget address
Feb. 9, Rendell said the state ex-
pects to end this ﬁscal year with
a deﬁcitof $525 million, when
the original estimate was only
$450 million. He hopes legisla-
tors will approve the new budget
by the time the new ﬁscal year
begins, making it the ﬁrst time
in his eight years as governor that
this would happen.

Raymond said Rendell’s sales
tax proposition would increase
Pennsylvania’s tax revenue by $6
billion, but it would decrease the
rate of taxes by one third.

Raymond clariﬁed that the
proposed increase is “a long way
from law.”

University prepares  
for commencement  

Eric Shannon
Staﬁ"Wri ter

» The University is starting preparations, for the

school—wide commencement ceremony and ex-
pects send out invitations inthe mailthisweek for
students to attend the Graduation Central.

Associate Director of Special Eh/ents Jason
Morrill said Graduation Central, sponsored by
the Pitt Alumni Association in conjunction with
The Book Center and the Office of Special Events,
willtake place be‘tween11a.m. and7p.rn. April13
and April 14 inthe Connolly Ballroom 
Hall. The event will help students prepare for
their commencement.

“It’s a fair for students who want to sign up
for commencement. Studentswillbe abletobuy
their cap and gown, a class ring, and there will
be signups for the Alumni Association,” Mor-
rill said.

Students will also receive insn'uct1'ons regard-
ing the ceremony.

“Therewillbe packets for students and their
family thatwill help them with everything from
where to park, to what time the doors open and
where they should reporttowithin the Petersen,”
Morrill said.

Morrill said around -3,000 students attend.-

Graduation Central, which is not mandatory but

stronglyadvised. Students who miss Graduation I

Centralwill stillbe able to register and buy their
regalia at the Book Center, he said.

The commencement ceremony, arranged
by the Office of Special Events, willtake place in
the Petersen Events Center at 2 p.m. May 2. The

ceremony is open to any student who graduates '

in the 2009-2010 schoolyearwho  registered
to graduate with her adviser or-the dean’s oﬂice
of her school. -

According to the Registrar’s website, schools
have students register to graduate prior to the
springsemester and thejanuary deadline through
the Registrar’s oﬂice. '

Most students have said that they have found
outthrough e-mails, advisers orword of mouth.
Still, some others didn’t realize they had to reg-
ister until later.

“I saw something [about registeringto gradu-
ate] in the window, so I signed up. I was a week

late and had to pay 15 bucks,” Jeff Tabaka, an .

undergraduate in the College of Business Ad-
ministration, said. '
Graduate—recognition events are hosted by
a number of Pitt schools and colleges, accord-
ing to the University’s commencement website.
Morrill said the date of each individual school’s

ceremony might vary from before the school— «

wide ceremony to weeks afterwards. .

Individual dates will soon be posted on the
school’s commencement website at vvww.pit:t.
evdu/commencement/ceremony/schools.ht1n,
Morrill said. . '

Since much of the information on different
ceremonies is still forthcoming, some students
are still deciding which ceremonies they want
to attend. A , x V ,_

“I already got separate info about the biology
one,” Anthonysulkowski said. “I’ll probably go
to both. Might as well.”

Others, such' as senior Carl Fenderson, who
is graduatingfrom the School ofPsychology, are
tentatively makingplans based on stories from
other people that have attended commencement
ceremonies before.

“I’m not going to the main one. I’ll probably

just go to the ‘psych’ one,” Fenderson said. “I

had friends that graduated last year and went ’

to the main one. They all said it was too long
and sucked.” I '

Pitt hopes for Google Fiber

Lindsay Carroll
Assistant News Editor

The University is encouraging the Pit com-
munity to support a recent city proposal to
make Pittsburgh a “test bed” for a new high-
speed Internet network.

The City submitted a proposal to Google

to bring Google Fiber, a ﬁbernoptic Internet
network which runs at one gigabit per second.
The new network would “deliver the Internet
to our homes at a speed more than 100-times
faster than what most of us have access to
today,” according to an e-mail sent to Pitt
students by Chancellor Mark Nordenberg

yesterday. . .
“For this tremendous opportunity for the '

city and the University to come to fruition,
though, your help is needed,’_’ Nordenberg
said.

He said that the technology would enhance
Pitt’s distance and online learning capabilities,
give faculty and stud_ents connectivity needed
to manage large data sets, bringopportunities
to the city’s art and health industries and “help

‘drive the redevelopment of Pittsburgh even

further into a technology-based economy.”

Students can express support for Pitts-
burgh’s application at.pittsburghgoesgoogle.~
com and click “Add Your Voice”’by March
26. - ' 1
“Google has made it clear that commu-
nity support will be one of the key factors in
its decision on test bed sites, so your help is
crucial,” Nordenberg said.

Review board to access G—20 police documents

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

After months of delays and a court

‘order, the city might open up about

the G-20 Summit.

' Judge R. Stanton WettickJr., of the
Court of Common Pleas forAllegheny
County, issued an order last Thursday
sayingthe Pittsburgh Bureau ofPolice
must give the Citizen Police Review
Board the G—20—related documents it
requested for its investigation.

The court order provided the city
with 20 days — until April 6 — to
comply by sending the Citizen Police
Review Board the documents related
to 29 incidents for which it requested
documentation and to provide alog of
documents that fell under the scope
of national security. Wettick said in
the opinion that the Citizens Police
Review Board was within its author-
ity to initiate its own investigation,
and the city needed to comply with
the subpoena.

Diane Richard, a spokeswoman
for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,
and Alan Johnson, an attorney rep-
resenting the city, directed questions
tojohn Doherfy, an associate city so-

licitor. Doherty declined to comment
further on the judge’s order, saying
only that “the attorneys are review-
ing the opinion and the court order
and formulating an ‘appropriate re-

_ sponse.”

Since the end of September, city
ofﬁcials have declined to comment on
the Summit multiple times or referred
questions to the city solicitor’s office
or outside counsel.

Elizabeth Pittinger, executive di-
rector of the Citizen Police Review
Board, said the board needed the
documents to move forward with
its investigation. After several public
hearings on the subject, they need
more input on what happened from
the law enforcement side of the story,
Pittinger said.»

"‘All we have is the public side of ’l

the story. We don’t have enough in-
formation of what law enforcement
was about,” Pittinger said.

This was the ﬁrst time in the 13
years since the board began that the
city had attempted to block one of its

. investigations by claiming that the -

board had overstepped its bounds,
Pittinger said.

The referendum that established
the Citizen Police Review Board also

gave it the power to make recommen-
dations to the mayor and the police
bureau regarding police training, hir-
ing and disciplinary policies.
Wettick cited the home rule char-
ter, whichworks as asort oflocal con-

. slitution, inhis opinion.Areferendum
' in the charter established the board

as an independent body of the city in
1997 and empowered it to investigate
individual claims of police miscon-
duct and provide recommendations
on the police bureau’s policies.

Beth Pittinger:
All we have is

the nubile side

oi the story.

The board decided to launeh its

own investigation after it received.

complaints about police practices
.during G—2o. That, the city alleged,
overstepped the board’s limited
authority to investigate individual
claims of misconduct, according to
court documents. .

The judge disagreed and saidinhis

opinion that the board needed to be
able to launch its own investigations
to ﬁllﬁll its capacity in advising the
mayor and police bureau.

In early November, Pittinger said
that the board’s investigation might
be ﬁnished before the beginning of
the summer. Pittinger said that the
delays put the board several months
behind in its investigation.

Pittinger said that she would need
to see the police documents before
guessing how long the investigation
would take or what the board’s next
course of action might be.

The board issued the subpoenas
after it did not receive a response
from document requests sent in the
ﬁrst week of November, Pittinger
said. The city did not comply with
the subpoenas, statingthatthe board
overstepped its bounds by initiating
its own investigation, according to
Wettick’s opinion. A

.The courtorderfromWettickstat- '

ed thatalldocumentsinthe subpoena
must be handed over to the board,
unless the documents pertained to

national security. The city would have '

to provide a citation under federal
law in a privilege log for documents

ing that day, according to a Port Authority
brochure. Many routes will be combined’
or eliminated. 0

The 59U will be discontinued and re-

to change on April 4

placed by the 75 Ellsworth, which will run

Blanket policies
keep WVU coeds
cold at night  

0 maybe your roommate
has a propensity for
sneaking some of the food
mom sent you or keeping the
lights on all night when you have
an 8 a.m. class the next morning.

V Yes, roommates can be tough

to live with. But there’s perhaps
no greater annoyance than the
roommate who constantly has
his significant other — or friend
with a few beneﬁts —— spending
the night and creating an uncom-
fortable situation.

West Virginia University has a

a policy that forbids visitors of the

opposite sex to spend the night
in all of its dorms except for one
upperclassman, university-af-
ﬁliated apartment building, ac-
cording to the Associated Press.
Discontent with the rule, WVU
students planned a sit-in protest
outside some of its dorms.

By any measure the policy is
old fashioned. However, a blan-
ket policy like this is an efficient

way to deal with the issue even if g

it’s markedly unpopular. Part of
the college experience. involves

' learning to negotiate conﬂict

with roommates. Still, there will
' assuredly be other dilemmas to
work out. ’
Most schools that administer
more stringent policies when it
comes to interaction 4 espe-

’ cially overnight interaction —

between sexes are private and
religiously afﬁliated. WVU is
neither. West Virgina is a more
conser_vative_state, however, and
WVU is the largest college in the
state. It has an undergraduate
population of around 21,000 stu-
dents. While a more conservative
decision like banning overnight
stays intends to be a practical
measure of minimizing conﬂict

between roommates, it could be
a reﬂection of the state’s mor
traditional values. ‘
Freshmen at WVU are re-
quired to live on campus, but
after that they’re free to move
away. Thosewho aren’t satis-
fied with the policy can move
off campus for the rest of their

' college career.

The school’s policy limits de-
bate over an issue that’s,' well,
particularly sensitive and dif-
ﬁcult to talk about.‘The Univer-
sity has students sharing a room
fill out contracts that address
everything from taking out the
trash to deciding lights—out time.

‘ Pitt and many schools offer such
contracts, but the documents
feel more perfunctory than au-
thoritative. '

A An editorial in The Daily.

Athenaeum — WVU’s student
newspaper -— praised the over-
turning of this policy when it
was first proposed earlier this
year. But some WVU students
ﬁnd the policy discriminatory
toward heterosexuals. Because
the policy only restricts oppo-
site sex visitors, homosexual
_couples could still allow same-
sex guests and signiﬁcant others
to spend the night. The edito-
rial said: “The current policy
discriminates against individu-
als of all sexual preferences, as
dorm residents can only sign
in guests of the same gender 
The policy inadvertently favors
gay and lesbian couples while
simultaneously ignoring their
existence.”

In these situations, room- '

mates would have to rely on
proper communication —— which,
in an ideal world, would be the
solution to this issue.

THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID

Game Show a chilling remake

MCT Campus

“Le jeu de la mort” remakes Milgram’s experiment with a TV twist

   
 

Caitlyn Christensen

In “Le jeu de la mort,” or “The Game
ofDea ,” French documentary ﬁlm-
makers managed to replicate Stanley
Milgram’s famous psychological ex-
periment. Producers told dozens of
people that they were taking part in
the pilot for a new game show called
“Zone Xtreme” and convinced them
to administer what appeared to be
strong electric shocks to afellow con-
testant. The documentary was shot
last year and broadcast last week.

_ Hardlyaharmless game show, the
documentaryis an indication that the
glamour of celebrity and pressure of
a TV show can alter typical behavior

. — in this case, it increases the likeli-
. ness of participants to inflict physical

harm on other part1'cipants. It chill-
ingly shows what pains we’ll go to in
the name of entertainment and how
inﬂuential the camera lens can be.

Columnist

Participants received no ﬁnancial

incentive to apply the shocks.

Only 16 out of 69 participants re-
ﬁrsed to push levers deliveringa460-
volt “shock.” People who asked the
show’s host to allowthemto stop were
easily persuaded to continue. It seems
theTVcameraheld enough pervasive
power to compromise morality.

In the original experiment, con-
ducted in the 1960’s by Yale research-
ers, subjects were told theywere par-
ticipating in a memory study. They
were instructed to administer electric
shocks to someoneinadifferentroom
if the person gave an incorrect an-
swertoaquestion. Afcerthe “leamer”
stopped responding, many people
indicated their desire to stop the ex-
periment and check on him. But with

_ aseries ofverbal prompts, 65 percent

of the participants continued on to
administer the ﬁnal 450-volt shock.

The recent experiment is even
more sinister than Milgram’s because
it introduces the element of television.

The participants knew that they were
being observed by hundreds, possibly
thousands, ofviewers but chose to ad-
minister the shocks anyway. It seems

- thisfactoraloneshouldhaveprovided

more incentive to stop. Taken out of
the laboratory setting, the orders
were carried out for spectacle, not
science. ’ ‘

In the Milgram experiment, the
scientists’ white lab coats, assumed

intelligence and authority contrib-

uted to the participants’ faith that
the experiment was for the greater
good. The experimentwas devised to

test whether or not the very many ac-

complices of the Holocaust may have

aided in an'ociI1'es largely because of
the tremendous power of authority. A

television camera’s persuasivepower
isperhaps more subtle, but it certainly

is an inﬂuential device.

Milgram attributed the partici-
pants’ compliance in his experiment
to fulﬁlling the authority ﬁgure’s ex-
pectations. In his 1974 book “Obedi-

thatthe participants’ moral concerns
shift — in standards of conscience
—— to considering how well they are
performing the mission assigned to
them. Similar to a soldier bombing a
village inwartime, the participant felt
shame or guilt depending on howwell
he performed the task, disregarding
the people he might have harmed.
 In this case, it appears the author-
ity ﬁgure was entertainment, as well
as the cues provided by the host. Ful-

be inﬂicted to satisfy an audience’s

-“For each theme, we tried to

ﬁnd a person that reﬂected all the .

contradictions and complexities. of
that one theme,” Lizzie Gillett, the
ﬁlm’s producer, said. I

For the theme of increasing
consumption, for example, the ﬁlm
crew traveled to India to proﬁle the
owner of a low-cost airline, and for
the theme of industry power, the
ﬁlm crew traveled to the Niger Delta
in search of locals who hadbeen
hurt by oil companies.

“We wanted it to be a global
story,” Gillett said. »

Another award—winning docu- ..

mentary, “Pray the Devil Back To
Hell,” underscores the impact one
person can have on an entire na-
tion. The ﬁlm chronicles the story
of Leymah Gbowee, who led a band

of women in a protest outside the

Liberian presidential palace to force

a resolution to halted peace talks.
Director of photography Kirsten

‘ Johnson said the women’s stories,

now a source of inspiration, had
previously gone unnoticed.
“There was very little documen-
tation of the women engaged in this
brave act of social protest,”Johnson
said. “That was part of what moti-
vated [producer] Abby and [direc-
tor] Gini —— to make sure that their
story didn’t get forgotten.” _
’ A third documentary, “In Ser-
vice: Iraq to Pittsburgh,” makes
global conflict a local issue. The

ﬁlm features the stories and foot-

age_of 15 Pittsburghers who served
in the war as soldiers, journalists

and government officials.

“I wanted to depict, in some way,
what it was reallylike over there
—— without the CNN sugarcoating,”
Vituccio said.

Vituccio saidithe predicament of
being thrust into a wartime situa-
tion became a fascination of his.

“How do you act? What’s going
on in your head? If you’re raised
Catholic, or Jewish or whatever,
what’s the ethical, moral dilemma
you have to face when you have to
kill someone?” Vituccio said. “That’s
extraordinary circumstances.”

Almost all these ﬁlms will be ac-
companied by events that help re-
enforce such themes. The documen-
tary “The Garden,” for example, will
be coupled with a discussion with
the director. Another ﬁlm, “Z32,”
will feature a live performance from
the ﬁlm’s score. A third, “Mid-Au-
gust Lunch,” will feature an attempt
by the local Italian restaurant Stag-
ioni to recreate the food and wine
made in the movie.

“The events enforce the message
of the ﬁlms,” Quelcy Kogel, the fes-
tival’s writer, said in an e—mail-. “We

_have to answer the question ‘how do
‘we make this ﬁlm come to life and
. mean more for the audience?”’

While ﬁnding stories and trying

. to reach a global audience can often

be a thankless, arduous experience,
all ﬁlmmakers agree on one thing:
It’s worth the effort. '

“It really restores your belief
in human nature,” Gillett said. “I
wouldn’t have wanted to do any-
thing else with the last seven years
of my life.”

ALBUM REVIEW

Indie rock darlings get all fuzzy

Now blog and college radio royalty, Spoon moves away from the catchy tunes that made them big and goes the lo -ft route.

Brendan Coticchia
For The Pitt News

Spoon

Transference

Merge Records

Rocks like: The Strokes
channeling Pitchfork’s “Best
of 2008” list

Grade: B

For most of the past decade,
Texan quartet Spoon has found
itself being pulled in two oppos-
ing directions. On one hand, the

band has been rooted‘ in the in- —

die crowd for most of its career,
where it is regarded as a groovy,
Southern-tinged Pavement. The
trend of the past several years,
however, has seen Spoon drawn
toward more mainstream accep-
tance, as evident by its work’s in-
clusion in everything from “The
O.C.” to “Cloverﬁeld.”
Transference is Spoon’s sev-
enth LP — its ﬁfth within the

past ten years. Although the
band’s last album, 2oO7’s Ga Ga
Ga Ga Ga, with its rhythmically
driven pop and punchy singles,
might have placed the band
ﬁrmly on track for further corn-

V mercial stardom, it ironically has

backtracked a little with its latest
release. But onlya little. ' ' ' "
Not much has changed in
terms of the band’s songwrit-
ing, helmed primarily by vocal-
ist Britt Daniel ‘and drummer
Jim Eno. The most jarring dif-
ference between‘ Transference
and Spoo_n?s previous few albums
lies in thelsound itself. The band
has. moved away from overly crisp
production values and toward
a lo—ﬁ sound reminiscent of its
earlier work. V .
Clocking in at just short of 45
minutes, the result is largely a
mixed bag. Tracks such as lead
single “Written In Reverse,” with
its crunchy, staccatoguitar and
harmonized vocals, beneﬁt great-
ly from this treatment. Songs like

the piano ballad “Goodnight Lau-
ra” do not. Although undoubtedly
a solid album overall, Transfer-
ence’s most disconcerting weak—
ness lies in the absence of a truly
great track. .
None of the songs are particu

larly bad, but there is nothing
that reaches the immediacy of
“The Way We Get By” or “I Turn
My Camera On.” Tracks like “The
Mystery Zone” might aspire to
those heights but end up sound-

ing above average at best.

Whether or not you consider
Transference a step forward or
backward for Spoon hinges large-
ly on your opinion of the band’s
last several albums_.

If you admired the band’s
work when it was signed to
Matador Records and Elektra,
it’s likely to be a welcome sur-
prise. If your introduction to the
band was through the “Stranger
Than Fiction” soundtrack, it’ll
probably leave you scratching
your head.

cessful comedies lies in the reces-
sion and in how the mass enter-

upside the head so hard by real-
ity that a little vulgarity inserted
into its entertainment resources
comes as a welcome treat.

Or it may tie into the resur-

_gence of the ’8os in our everyday

pop culture lives. Leg warmers are
back in style (I think) and synth-
pop is in vogue (see my Goldfrapp
“Head First” review), so it seems

natural cinema is reaching out to ‘

the era of the pioneers of hard—R
comedy, such as “Porky’s.”

Of course, this too might be
symptomatic of the recession:
Who doesn’t want to put himself

consumerism and a thriving ﬁnan-

So as long as the ﬁlms stay
funny, and_ as long as t_hey‘don’t

sake of the box office, I will cer-
tainly buy into the idea of hot tub
time travel. I’ll probably see the

ALBUM REVIEW

 

Harlem matures from
‘Drugs’ to ‘Hippies’

Liz Keeney

S Staﬁ‘ Writer

Harlem

Hippies

Matador

Rocks like: The Black Lips

Grade: B

The terms “Harlem’.’ and “hippies” are

rarely, if ever, used in the same sentence. .

When people think of the New York neigh-
borhood, the stereotypical tie—dye wearing
free spirits do not usually come to mind.
However, Austin, Texas-based band Har-
lem hopes to change that with its newest
release, Hippies.

While the Harlem reference may be
questionable, the garage—rock trio lives
up to its album’s title. Sounding like a mix
between the ﬂower children of the ’60s and
the punks of the ’70s — but with the lo-fi
style of the ’5os — Hippies is simple and
catchy. Tracks such as “Friendly Ghost”
and “Be Your Baby” highlight Harlem’s

‘unique yet vintage style.

While vocalists Michael Coomers and
Curtis O’Mara both have interesting
enough voices to distinguishthemselves
from the music, after listening to all 16
tracks, they become somewhat repetitive,
even boring. Each track is individually
good, but as a whole, the album is some-
what monotonous,'something a new band
should be wary of. ‘

The trio, made up of Coomers, O’Mara
and bassistjose Boyer, has been garnering
support for the past several years in its
home state of Texas throughraucous live
performances and its debut LP, Free Drugs.
While Hippies still manages to capture the
natural, free-spiritedness of Free Drugs,
it is more polished, calculated and on the
whole mature. If a band with songs titled
“Gay Human Bones” and “Stripper Sunset”
can really be considered mature.

Overall, Hippies is a good sophomore
effort from a band likely to gain notori-
ety on the indie music scene — deﬁnitely
worth a listen. 4 -

ALBUM REVIEW

,Synth—pop can be art

Kieran Layton
A 8 E Editor

Goldfrapp

Head First

Mute Records Ltd A .
Rocks like: Yaz, “Xanadu” the musical
Grade: A- , ' ' '

If you were tolisten to only one song
from each of Goldfrapp-’s many albums,
you would think the duo suffered from
multiple personality disorder.

You can find sexy, grinding electronica

- (think “Strict Machine” on Black Cherry),
soothing ambient music in the vein of Zero
7 (“Lovely Head” on Felt Mountain) and
disco-reminiscent ditties that conjure im-
ages of Studio 54 (Supernature’s “Ride a
White Horse”).

One thing remains consistent, however.
No matter what the duo puts out, it’s al-
ways good, usually great and sometimes
masterful. A ’

Goldfrapp’s latest album, “Head First,”
is no exception, neither to the standard
of quality nor to the constantly changing
sound. This time around’, the duo takes us
straight to the middle of the ’8os synth-

pop craze. The music of that decade was

often made solely with the intent of sell-
ing records, whereas “Head First” is the

' antithesis of that .— an album of perfectly

orchestrated beats," lyrics‘ and melodies

that heighten a movement so drenched
in superficiality that it elevates it to true
‘art. , . -
, Who would have thought synth-pop
and art wouldever be uttered in the same
sentence? A
Opening track “Rocket,” also the first
single, brings to mind Jefferson Starship
and sets the mood perfectlyfor the fol-
lowing tracks. “Believer” and “Alive” are
two more highlights, in which the former
seems to meld perfectly into the latter,
lifting theylistener up to some sort of pop-
music cloud nine.

_ “Shiny and Warm” most closely resem-
bles the duo’s previous _work and sticks
out — in a good way — from the other
tracks on the album.

The album lasts a brief 38 minutes, with
only nine tracks on the standard version,
i and perhapsthe best compliment I could
pay it is that there isn’t a weak track to
bring down the overall experience.
Although it is beautiful, elating pop-
music cheese, the fact remains that it is
still different. This is certainly not music
for everyone, and much more so than al-
bums like Supernature or Black Cherry, it
is directed to hardcore fans of Goldfrapp
and those pining for more ‘bands like Yaz
and more musicals like “Xanadu.”
Still, as singer Alison Goldfrapp coos,

I can’t let that go,” I can’t help but think

On the ﬁeld, Berliner tries to re-
main a calm and collected leader, for
the team. Although she feels nerves
and anxiety, she said she tries to stay
composed, because the pitcher sets
the tone for the rest of the team. A

“I try to tell myselfit could al-
ways be worse, and it could always
be better,” Berliner said. “Some-

” times those big hits seem like a big

deal, but it always depends. The

“She is very responsi e, very
dedicated to her sport and her stud-
ies and very, very bright,” Aprile said.
“She takes a lot of pride in what she

Q does and, combined with her talent,

she is a formidable competitor.”

That responsibility and dedica-

tion carries over to another duty of
Berliner’s: She is one of Pitt’s three
team captains. Berliner said she tries
to lead more by. example. She doesn’t

but that’s something she’s trying to

While Berliner is quiet, Aprile said

ten in Colorado.

Her father is from the Philadel-
phia area, and his side of the fam-
ily still lives there. Berliner said
she’d been to Pennsylvania to visit
on several occasions and liked the
eastern part of the country. When
she started looking at colleges, she
didn’t search anywhere other than
the East Coast.

“I wanted to get the experience of
going somewhere newbut being near
to family at the same time,” Berliner
said. “Pennsylvaniawas perfect. I had
lived on the West Coast before, and I
didn’t want to go back there.”

While Berliner admits that com-
ing to the city was an adjustment,
she’s happy living in Pittsburgh. One
of the biggest differences between
Fort Collins and Pittsburgh, she said,
is the architecture.

“Fort Collins is a small town com-
pared to Pittsburgh,” Berliner said.
“There are a lot of older buildings
here, whereas in Colorado, if you

want something, you build it.”
Berliner went for official visits at
the University of Pennsylvania, Dela-

ware and Colgate when searching

for a school but chose Pitt because it
was closer to her relatives and “felt

, like home.”

i “The girls on the team were
great,” Berliner said about her visit “I

really ﬁt in with them more than Iﬁt. S

in with the girls at the other schools}

' It had good classes and challenging
‘ work, whichis somethinglwas look- I

ing for.”

Berliner started playing softball
when shewas ﬁvé years old in Califor-
nia. Her father introduced her to the
sport, and she was instantly hooked.
Although she couldn’t pinpoint 

- ﬁrst time she played, Berliner said’ it
was probably T—ball or coach—pitch
with neighborhood friends.

She didn’t start pitching until she
was eight years old, and even then,
she continued to play both third and
ﬁrst base. It wasn’t until her sopho-
more year of high, school that she
made the decision to focus solely on
pitching. ’ _ ‘

“I just had a knack for it,” Berliner
said. “My dad said this is what’s going
to be good foryou; this iswhat’s going
to get you places.”

From there, Berliner got a pitch-
ing coach in Colorado and began
workingwith her each week. She said
her father and her pitching coach
were the two greatest inﬂuences on
her career.

“My dad got me started, and he
taught me a lot of the basics of the
game that got me here,” Berliner said.
‘.‘My pitching coach, she taught me
everything I needed to know about
pitching before I came to college.”

Still, there were differences be-
tween soﬁball at the high school level
and the collegiate level that Berliner
had to adjust to. At Pitt, Berliner said
she has to concentrate on studying
the charts and player batting infor-
mation given to her by the coaches,

because unlike in high school, she

can’t pitch to everyone the same
away.

“Every batter is like the best hit-
ters you faced in summer and high
school — and now there is a whole
team of them,” Berliner said.

Berliner is given pitching charts
of players she and the other pitch-
ers have thrown against. The charts,
resources that Berliner didn’t have in
high school, show the pitches thrown
and how each batter reacted.

She said‘ that pitchers study the

charts in'between innings and canup- ”

date their knowledge during games
based on how the player performed
during her_ last at—bat. The pitchers
learn each batter’s strengths and
weaknesses as she comes through,

Berlinerbecame a much smarter
pitcher from her ﬁrst year until this
season, Aprile said, and the junior
generally doesn’t make the same rnis—

- takes twice. She added that Berliner

has both the talent and drive to be an
All—Big East pitcher.

“Her biggest strengths are her
ability to hit small spots on the plate,
to keep the ball low in the zone and
deﬁnitely her change—up,” Aprile
said. “She has a sick change—up.”

FOOTBALL

. . March’ 25, 201.0 i'The'Pitt News I WWw.pittneWs.comV.V

Spring practice begins

Starting quarterback position is up for grabs.

Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ”Wri tar

The Pitt basketball season might have just
ended, but Pitt football is already back to
work for its spring practice season.

The Panthers return six starters on
defense and five on offense and might
be a pre—season Top 15 pick as well as the
preseason favorite in the Big East. But
even with all the early hype, there is still
plenty of competition for starting jobs
early this spring. .

While sfartingjobs probably won’t be
decided until training camp in August,
impressive performances this_spring will
go a long way to determining who will have
an edge ‘heading into the summer.

The most anticipated competition is
at quarterback. 

Redshirt freshman Tino Sunseri has V

been taking all of the ﬁrst-team reps so

. far this spring, but redshirt sophomore

Pat Bostick has been pushing him for the
top spot. ' _ -
Both quarterbacks are open to the com-

petition, though. They feel that it’s good V

for them and the team as a whole.

“It only makes you betteriand‘, from a
program standpoint, you can identify the
fact that you have multiple players at posi-
tions that can win for you,” Bostick said.
“You have to be able to have depth, and
competition’s a huge part of that.” A

With the loss of senior tight ends Nate
Byham and Dorin Dickerson, the tight end

position also suddenly became an area '

with little returning experience. But the

Panthers have several players who can step A

up to ﬁll the spots left bythe seniors. 3 
Sophomore Mike Cruz has the “edge
on a starters spot, but freshman Brock
DeCicco and Andrew Devlin, a transfer
from Virginia, are in the mix as well.
“We have different guys who have spe-
cial abilities,” Head Coach Dave Wannstedt

said. “One might be a betterreceiver; the
other might be a better blocker. We’re go-
ing to need them all.” h

The Panthers also lost two starters at
cornerback with the departure of Aaron
Berry andjovani Chappel. Ricky Gary and
Antwuan Reed are thought to be the start-
ers going into this year.

But with Gary suffering an injury that
might force him to-miss the entire spring,
junior college transfer Saheed Imoru has
been practicing with the first team de-
fense and making the most of this oppor-
tunity.

Imoru has shown great speed and re-
ﬂexes with his best practice on Saturday
when he broke up an out-route intended
for receiver Cam Saddler as well as an im-
pressive deflection on a deep ﬂea—ﬂicker
intended for All-Big East receiver Jon
Baldwin. _ - — -

“The positive is that everything we saw

BURGOS AND FRIES

Woods needs to be

Evan Burgos
Senior Staff Writer

  

This past week, Tiger Woods announced his
return to golf. He intends to compete at the
Masters beginning April 8 after a four-and-a-
half month layoff spent away from the public’s
view in the wake of an unearthed sex scandal
that captivated the world.

Since his re-emergence from seclusion,
Woods and his handlers have been — cautiously,
to say the least — allowing media availability.
He gave his ﬁrst public statements to a select
few media members in an anonymous hotel
ballroom. Questions were not permitted.

Last Sunday, Woods granted two addition-

al interviews, one to tails of the ambiguous
ESPN and the other to police report drafted
the GolfChannel, and the evening of the ac-
each sessionwas lim- . cidentwill not sufﬁce.

was solemn and ap-
peared genuine. But
the sheer nature of
such interviews belies those points. If Woods
truly wants to rehabilitate his image, he must
wave all restrictions and answer all -the tough
questions. ,

Woods said he wants to change. He said he

, got away from his core values and lived an en-

titled and reckless life. From the time he won
his ﬁrst green jacket atAugustain1997, Woods,
by some accounts the most recognizable and fa-
mous athlete in the world, has portrayed ahighly
controlled and calculated image that concealed

his true personality. Image maintenance is what I
i got him in this pickle. So why does he think it

will get him out of it?

If itwere up to Woods, he wouldwinback the
adoration of fans and corporate endorsements
on the golf course. He would win the Masters
in a few weeks and all would be forgotten. But
that won’t be enough —— although, if he does
win, think of the hoopla thatwill surround him.

Woods needs to be candid to be trusted.

pen to earn trust back

He’d be a media darling for overcoming such
adversity, right?

But no, to have any chance at fully winning
back the respect he lost through various extra-
marital affairs, Woods must now betray all the
things that got him to that point in the ﬁrst
place — the insane image control, the hidden
personality and the “no commen ”—type an-
swers that shut people out.

I have a rough time arguing that any indi-
vidual is “obligated” to divulge to the world the
details of his personal life. But in the case of a

ﬁgure as public and world famous as Woods, M

who wields social inﬂuence in the same manner
in which he wields a 7-iron, it is now necessary.
He has to answer every question he is asked. He
must be honest and truthful. Referring to the de-

Woods needs to get

ing implemented by
sponsors? I

A -Chances are Woods doesn’t have all the an-
swers. Perhaps he is as ﬂummoxed as we all
are. But he can still provide insights. He doesn’t

have to spill every bean, but he does have to V

try and rationalize the recent events in his life
to the public - that is, if he wants to win back
their trust.

Because that’s what this is really about:
winning back the trust of millions around the
globe. If Woods doesn’t care  though he said
he does in his ESPN  then it doesn’t
matter. He can keep things private, and we will
never know. ‘

But until the blanket of restrictions and
stipulations are lifted, Woods will not have
satisﬁed the general public or the media in re-
gard to the events in his life over the past four
months. And he will never be regarded in the

same light again.

_The soccer stadium will serve
as the home for both the men’s
and women’s soccer teams. It will
be used as a competition venue as
well as a practice facility.

“The new ﬁeld will give us a
great competitive advantage,”
said women’s soccer Head Coach
Sue Moy Chin. “It will be great to

Men’s soccer coach Joe Lux-

soccer-speciﬁc facility that will
rank among the best in the Big

Luxbacher, “less than adequate.”
The new stadium has a seating
capacity of 735, and will be easily
accessible to campus.

“Playing on campus in front
of your friends and being overall

easier for people to attend means

a lot,” said Chin.

The softball stadium will fea-

the synthetic grass outﬁeld and
an eight-foot-tall’, 20o—foot sym-
metrical outﬁeld wall, complete
with batting and pitching prac-

of 600.

“It will be a tremendous up-
grade,” softball Head Coach Holly
Aprile said. “Just the aesthetics of
it. The new ﬁeld will be just ours.
Our own cages, our own ﬁeld,
everything, —- and it will help
transform upper campus.”

Like the other coaches, Aprile
stressed about accessibility to

to worry about the baseball team

Aprile continued, “Right now

Another major advantage, ac-

in the recruiting department.

They all agree that it has already '

“Just showing recruits the new

Luxbacher said. “This helps us

“We can use the ﬁeld to high-
