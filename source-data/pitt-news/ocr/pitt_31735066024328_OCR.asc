Procedure ForN€W

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer
The first draft ofa document out-

lining the annual review of academic-

administrators at P'itt‘was presented
to the Senate Council at a meeting
Monday. .

The document, a joint subcom-
mittee report out of the Senate Edu-
cational Policies and Budget
Policies committees, outlines the
“general policies» and procedures”
for a process ofindividual reviews of
university" administrators.

Richard H. Pratt,:chairman ofthe
Educational Policies Comitteeanda
member of Pitt’s physics and astron-
omy department, emphasized in his
presentation that this was not a
“final document,” but he speculated

that by the March Senate Council‘

meeting the final draft would be dis-
cussed and “hopefully approved.”
The draft document is broken into
four sections: I
- -an introductibn to the “concepts
of formal evaluation;”
-the process of‘ the review with
specific,mention of privacy and
confidentiality of all reviews;

\

-the individuals anmd groups to
be reviewed or to review the

administrator;

-and a timetable for implementa-

thorough, but not burdensome" to ‘

Weston Heldln Walker Slaying

A suspect has been arrested and
charged with ‘criminal homicide in
the Octobe killing ofa Pitt student.
Frank Weston, 26, will stand trial in
April for the shooting of Pitt theatre
arts student Robert Walker.

“There’s been no exact date set

yet,” Sgt. John Fla_nnigan, head of '

the Pittsburgh City Police homicide
department, said. “But he’ll proba-
bly be brought to trial in about two
months.” _

Weston, a convicted robber, had
been in a Yardville, New Jersey pri-
son when police secured a warrant
for his arrest in December. Weston
is now being held in the county jail,

according to. Flannigan.
Flannigan added he is‘ unable to

‘reveal other inforrriation about the

case becauseiof court and depart-
ment restrictions. 7
Walker, 22, was shot, during a
robbery at Martini Imports, 119
Meyran Ave., ‘Oakland. His body
was discovered in a basement office
of the shoe store, with his arms and
legs bound and a hood covering his

‘head.

He diediin Presbyterian Univer-
sity Hospital the next day from a
gunshot wound to the head.

. The robbery netted less than $50,
according to police.

, Police had received an anomym-
ous tip in“De'cember that Weston
could be the possible killer. The tips-
ter suggested Weston was in a New
Jersey jail, ‘Pittsburgh _ detectives
later located /him at the Youth

‘Reception and Correction Center in

Yardvil1e,whe_re he had‘ been held
since Oct. 27 for aparole violation.

Economic

Forecast:

- ‘Troublesome’

By SETH LUKOVE
The Pill News Staff Writer

The nation’s economicoutlookfor
1981 will be a “troublesome recov-
ery,” predicts Reuben Slesinger, a

professor in Pitt's economic
department.
Slesinger, who made his

2 December 1980 economic forecast
.in as paper titled “l98l: A year of

Many Uncertainties,” described the
nation's attempt to recover from its
economic downturn as being “slow

‘ and protracted.”

“Basically, no sector of the econ-
omy looks particularly strong,” Sle-
singer writes. “Furthermore,
nothing the White House is likely to
do will have much impact on the
broad pattern of business before the
second..half of 198], but unemploy-
ment, because of “slow growth" in
the amount of jobs combined with
an increase in -workers seeking
employment, will remain over eight
percent. 1
However, don't lose all confi-
dence in the U.S. economy for i981,
because “on the whole, conditions
will be better than in I980,” Slesin-
ger writes. But he warns that individ-
uals and businesses will not

experience the “booming growth”

consistent with the initial stages of
recovery.

Economic forecasting for I981 isa
difficult task due to a number of
uncertain economic factors, Slesin-
ger said in an interview Monday.
These uncertainties are com-
pounded by the new Reagan admin-
istration coming into office, “whose
philosophies you don't know yet."

“Theoretically. you don’t know
how far he’ll push," Slesinger said.
“The political scene makes it a very
uncertain scene."

But the most uncertain scene of all
Slesinger cites in his forecast is
whether or not the country knows
where the economy has been, let
alone where it will go.

If we were to base our analysis on
recent statistics, there ‘would be
cause to believe that the 1980 reces-
sion was over “sometime” last
summer, Slesinger asserts.

Retail sales, fueled by a recovery
in the homebuilding and automobile
industries, have been on the rise
since June. Employment has
increased by 670yO00 since the same
month and personal incomes are up
by $69 billion while industrial pro-
duction has climbed by 1.6 percent

since July, according to Slesinger. ,.

So '“needless to say,” Slesinger

Reuben Slesinger, professor in Pitt’s economic department, says America’s economic recovery"

will be slow.

writes “these rising monthly
numbers were enough to push up the
overall economy by an annual rate
o£.one percent in the third quarter,
as measured by the change in the
gross national product adjusted for
inflation.” '

But, enter high interest rates and
the rate of inflation tocast doubt
upon an impression of a favorable
rccovery;,if the recession is still cur-
rent, then “rising interest rates and

higher inflation rates will only
worsen and prolong it,”according to
Slesinger.

Then on the other hand, if. the
economy has experienced an
upwardfswing, “then the uptrend in
interest rates and the rate of inﬂa-
tion are sure to weaken it--if not
abort it altogether.”

All figures taken into account, “it

is rather unlikely” that the recession ‘

was over this summer, Slesinger
V .

concluded.

Citing what he describes as “lows
created artiﬁcially by the imposition
of credit controls by the Federal

‘Reserve,” Slesinger attributes the

rising economic statistics ofthe third
quarter of I980 to a “rebound” from
these credit controls.

Slesinger's argument is that if we 4

wish to consider the third quarter of
1981* as a new expansion, then these
same statistics will have to continue
to rise.

Consistent with standard eco-
nomic reasoning, Slesinger points to
the four major sectors of the econ-

omy: consumersjdomestic business,
exports, and government, and he

examines each one to see if it will
strengthen the economy for 1981. /

Consumers won’t accomplish it
because the growth in their incomes
is being offset by the growth in pri-
ces, as measured by the gross

Roth photo

national product version ofthe Con-
sumer Price Index, and saving rates
are “well below normal.”
Although the “environment is
more favorable than it has been for
business,” Slesinger said a decline in
consumer spending has unloaded a
large amount of inventories on busi-
ness‘s shoulders. And so, taking into
account the high interest rates, Sle-
singer concludes that “businessmen
would be reluctant to stock any
more goods than they have to.”
So this leaves government and its
increased amounts of spending for
both defense and non-defense items.
But Slesinger is skeptical of whether
rising government spending is a
“plus or a minus.” Pointing to the
'government’s twelfth consecutive
year of running a deficit in its
budget, ' Slesinger concludes that
“such deficits do not contribute to
the. economy’s health.” The deficits

Dr. Conney Kimbo, vice chancel-

recommendations, four of which
concern fiscal policy.

“We acknowledge the strenu-_
ous effort made by the university
to increase state support for the
various programs to an average
level comparable to that of other
leading research universities and
call upon the state government to
heed this urgent need,” the report
said.

“If non-tuition support, par-
ticularly state support, does not
increase at least to match inﬂa-
tionary increases in future years.
we recommend that serious con-
sideration be given to program
reduction or closure...”

The report also supports the
present relationship between Pitt
and the Commonwealth of Pen-
nsylvania, but warns against
further encroachment on Pitt’s
autonomy by the state.

Also, the report recommends
the adoption ofa “stable formula
for the state portion of university
support.” ..

Another trouble area is in the
area ofinter-university commun-
ications between faculty, stu-
dents, and administration.

The evaluation team suggests
the inclusion of “various consti-
tuencies” in the planning and/ or
curtailment of programs, and the
institution of an ongoing self-
study program.

“Involvement in careful plan-
ning of institutional goals often
serves to rally the campus com-
munity toward a common end,”
the report states.

One issue‘which provoked a
great deal of student discussion-
while their evaluation team was
on campus was the “competency

of teaching assistants and
instructors for whom English is
not their native language.”

This problem. according to the
report. is connected to the inter-
national reputation of the uni-
versity, and the fact that it
attracts large numbers of foreign
students.

The evaluation
mended Pitt’s efforts to deal with
the problem, but believes that
continued “attention" is
necessary.

In addition, the report assesses
university other programs: it
praises the committment of the
dean and faculty of CAS to the
“liberal arts tradition; the institu-
tion of interdisciplinary pro-
grams and the two-year-old
University Honors Program.

Pitt’s library system is under a
financial strain as a result of
inflation and an eroded purchas-
ing base according to the report.

. A number of measures, including
economies of scale and increased
automation, are suggested to
improve efficiency and “minim-
ize labor costs.”

“Automation has potential for
long range cost-effectiveness and
can provide the important data-
base necessary for the det_ermina-
tion of academic holdings,” the
report states.

In general, the evaluation

‘ team found the entire university

community both’ open and co-

Internships

By LINDA MILLER

Pitt News Stall’ Writer

Rolling Stone Magazine has one.

The Allentown and Sacred Heart
Hospital Center has one too.

So do the Democratic National
Committee, Heinz Hall‘ "and
Gimbels.

What they all have are intern-
ships. These are programs that could
provide both work experience and
college credit for qualified Pitt stu-
dents this summer and next fall.

Nearly 250 internship programs
are listed in I l catalogs on file in the
Internship’ Office, 213 Schenley
Hall. The catalogs contain the spe-
cific requirements and’ application
deadlines of each internship.

Retrofitting Helps Meet The Needs of The Disabled o

By SUSAN PECUCH

Retroffitting is underway at Pitt.
Retroffitting consists of proposed
changes in building design for han-
dicapped students, making campus

buildings more accessible and class-'

room _attendance more feasible for
them.

According to Wallace Jobusch.
director of the Physical Plant Div-
ision, the modifications involve ser-
vices for the blind, deaf and
physically handicapped, as well as
those in wheelchairs. -

The project includes: restroom
alterations, door frame adjustments,

lowering of public telephones and
water fountains, lowering elevator

controls as well as marking the floor

buttoms in braile or tactile, instal-
ling visual fire alarms for the deaf.
making more reserved parking areas

and building a'pool lift at Trees Hall '

for those who cannot use the

ladders.

Van Conklin, associate director of
plant services, has been working on
the project for several years.

“The Special Student Services
Office and the Physical Plant Div-
ision _realized the need for changes
back in the early 70’s,”Conklin said,

“so they asked the university for"

funds to start on the project. They
were alloted $136,218 to begin
working."

“The university started the project
on their own and should be given
credit for realizing the importance of
the modifications. A lot of places
waited for state funding before they
made any changes at all,” he added.

The project began outlining
necessary changes in each building
on campus. Urgent needs such as
bathroom alterations, elevator con-
trols, ramps and drinking fountains
were the primary concern. '

L The Technique Of Persuasion

J osh McDowell Speaking at Dr. Melia’s ‘Rhetoric In A Free Societal’ °‘a.55'

 

Dr. Melia comments on McDowell’s technique. .

By TIMQTHY P. McCABE

While Josh McDowell may have
had some people’s mind on the
Lord, Prof. Trevor Melia was exa-
mining the speaker‘s techniques of
rhetoric. Melia has studied and par-
ticipated incognito at religious ral-

lies and cult communes. He has
watched people get saved while play-
ing the piano at a mission in the
Yukon. He has dropped in on tent
meetings in the Bahamas and in
short, he’s seen some ofthe best and

_ some of the worst persuaders,

“He’s a fine example of a’ major
persuasive group in our society,"

Melia saidiof this rhetoric specimen. -

Melia suggested that McDowell
‘may give God the glory for his suc-
cess as a persuader, which the pro-
fessor doesn’t deny, but from his
technicafrhetoricians view, he noted
thaf McDowell was extremely care-
ful to adapt to his audience and
spent the first-20 minutes of his

spech establishing his credentials‘

without mention of religion.

“At the end of 20 minutes you
knew he had been all over the world,
he’s been in exciting situations, run-

ning from spears in the jungle and ,

he’s not above making an allusion to
sex. In short, he's a’ marvel man,
which is a very good move vis a vis
the audience he's talking to,” Melia
said. 0

Melia also noticed that McDowell '

made references to professors and
universities.

“I think all of this is consciously
being designed\to be credible. He
isn’t naming ministers-and priests.
Thattis, l think, a careful attempt to
say the sort of thing will appeal to a

pniversity audience,” he said.

The result is the students, who are
expecting to be bombarded with
religion, are disarmed, according to
Melia. /

“We considered the installation of
these features as the first phase of
our project,“ Conklin said. “At this
point, about 75 percent of phase one
is completed. The state recently gave
us funds which should help finish 90
percent of our original plans easily,
as well as enabling us to offer more
services soon,"

According to Jobusch, the State
Rehabilitation Act of l973—Section
504, set guidelines and standards
that must be met. ‘

“Most of the guidelines involve
dimensions of rooms, maximum

ramp slopes, etc...The guidelines-

have been altered several times in the
past few years, causing some prob-
lems, but most of the requirements
have been eased .up on a bit,”
Jobusch said.

Giving Teachers
Credit

A classroom is a teacher’s domain.

Except at Pitt.

Penalties dealt by Pitt teachers for cheating can be
challenged and changed by a student—faculty hearing
board. _ V

The need for such a board is obvious; if a student
believes he or she has been dealt with unfairly, some
type of appeal process must be available.

Before the institution of such a board, students with
complaints had to go outside the university system.

“We don’t want the courts ofthe State of Pennsylva-

nia to visit classrooms and passjudgement,” where it is

more appropriate for the university to do so, Assistant
Provost Ray Steele said at last week’s seminar on
crime in the classroom.

But the power of this review board extends too far.

The appeals process of the board undermines the
authority ofteachers who wish to give severe penalties
for cheating. Not only can the board reverse a teacher's
decision, it can modify any penalty the teacher
imposes. ' -

at ram News

I Page 8—Wednesday, February 11, 1981

In addition, although the board can uphold or
reduce a pena1ty,,it can never increase it.

Teachers may be reluctant to initiate a charge of
cheating or severely penalize a strident when they
know their decisions will later be challenged. And,
these guidelines do not discourage teachers from being
too lenient. '

Al Bowen, director of the office of special student
services ‘said the guidelines eliminate unfairness.
Bowen added that teachers should only report cheat-
ing, but then act as witnesses before the board.

We think teachers deserve a little more credit.

A teacher is responsible for establishing the.

mechanics of his course. This responsibility includes
imposing standards for cheating at the onset of the
course. Once these standards are established, they
should not be subject to question by a review board.

The avenue of appeal remains open for students
who have been unfairly treated.

.But the classroom is the teacher’s domain, and this
authority should always be respected.

Column

aBy Jerome Wells
Department of Economics

With his speech last Thursday,
President Reagan formally entered
the battlefield where the political
careers of his two immediate prede-
cessors were destroyed. Fighting
that mythical dragon The Economy
has become the best game in town in
the seven years since Nixon was
driven from the oval office, and the
box score to date seems to be the
Presidency (alternatively read “eco-
nomic policy”) nil, The Economy 2.

Perhaps the game is being badly
"reported. The Economy--or The
Democrats, depending on your
point of view--has fielded Uncon-

"trolled Government, Bloated Defic-

its, Monetary Expansion and
Greedy Oil; Presidents and their
economic advisors have responded
with _a variety of second-string
player--COWPS and Freezes and
Windfall Profits Taxes. The strate-
gies are largely seen in macroeco-
nomic terms. Supply Siders,
Monetarists and Fiscal Disciplinar-
ians all vie for position. The Presi-
dent’s speech was largely in this vein:
a strong dose of the Old Time Reli-
gion (budget cuts, monetary res-
traint and-all’ that) with a dash of
supply Side wishful thinking that

somehow tax cuts will raise the

national capacity to producr useful

things.

 In Congress the game looks quite

-different, for it is here that the
. ‘microeconomics of macro policy--

., ‘o'per'at'.es/_with ,ai vehgeance.
“if.C:'.<.m8

Iglgft, enough to

uents? inter-7

ests are being trampled, and while
both the president and Congres cor-
rectly read america’s concern about
inﬂation and unemployment, it is
the details of the case that dictate
policy. It is not true that everybody
lose from inﬂation, or that everyb-
ody wins from stopping it. The
higher price you pay is someone
else‘s higher income, and where that

chain is to be broken is of vital’

importance to each individual and
interest group.

The budget-cutting play provides
perhaps the best example of this.
Are, say, student loans to be cut to
finance a little Kemp-Roth tax cut?
lf the play succeeds we have “less
government" (read less government
services or subsidies somewhere)
and lower taxes; if it fails we move
on to the monetary restriction play.
In any case, incomes are redistrib-
uted. and incentives provided for
change ‘in the economy.

Perhaps it is well that economists
cannot say exactly how any policy
will redistribute incomes and incen-
tives. The president dealt with this
issue most indirectly and gingerly in
his speech: welfare programs are to
be cut without hurting the
“genuinely needy,“ and another
attempt will be made to reduce
government overheads. Not that any
civil servant is actually fingered to be
separated from -his governmentjob--
new applicant are simply to be fro-
zen out.

The next‘-few months will tell a

great deal_about—the “what, how and, _

for*whom’7 of Reaganomics as Con-
gressggjid-’;the' president

 

 

economy. Some of the weak and

strong teams can already be identi-

fied. Higher education, for instance,
has neither the political clout‘nor the
market scarcity to prevent an ero-
sion of the resources devoted to it.
Tuition will continue to riserand real
salaries to fall; the interesting ques-
tion is whether hard times will
improve or worsen the functioning
of educational institutions. The con-
sensus over increased military
spending seems fairly strong, though
some rethinking may occur when the
budgetary trade-offs involved are
perceived. The once broad commit-
ment to “meeting basic needs" has_
declined,-and some freeloaders as
well as some of the genuinely needs
will be detached from their food
stamps. Other plays are decidedly in
doubt. Will auto workers be able to
put together a congressional coali-
tion to retain extended unemploy-
ment benefits and continue support
for Chrysler? Or will trade restric-
tions be use to cool the national
affection for Toyotas? -
All these questions are fascinat

ing, but they focus on the short run
and mask the‘ underlying causes of
our economic discontent. The
American economy needs to be
restructured--subsfantially--to deal

with the l980s and ‘90s. Consump- -
J .

tion patterns--public and private--
are inconsistent with the scarcity of
energy, the demographic structure
and the workings ofthe world econ-
omy. ‘To improve ‘(aggregate eco-

1

work”--the watchword of the

. Reaganites_--will probably aid in this

restructuring (although we tend to
forget that markets, as well as
government policies’, can on occa-

sion work perversely). ln working,"

however,,market_s will undoubtedly
redistribute incomes between indus-
tries and individuals. It is quite pos-
sible that the burden A of
readjustment will involve further
declines in real consumption stand-
ards of Americans, and that these
declines will be distributed quite
unequally. V

Here lies the dilemma ofthe presi-
dent and his economic advisors. Not
only must they find congressional
majorities (i.e._ get broad public sup-

Pa. First Among Losers In Support For Education

F

-‘I’ Dear Editor:

According to your issue of Feb. 2,
John Yeager, the deputy vice chan-
cellor of administration was
reported as saying that Pitt’s rank-
ing as the third-most expensive pub-
lic college in the nation was “not
news.” I agree. But what was news--
months ago--was that our state’s
support for higher education was

slipping to the bottom of the scale ’

for the nation. I again urge you to
make the student body aware that,

f'§,in terms of increased state support

over the last two years, Pennsylva-
nia was not number three but
number one--first among the losers.
I enclose my letter of Oct. I7 which
you chose not‘to publish.

lfyou had pressed this issue in the
fall, instead of concentrating "on

frills like the Semester-at-Sea, you
might have generated some collec-
tive student concern before the gov-
ernor’s budget was on the table.
Passive reporting offaits accomplis
are no service to the students.

Seymour Drescher, Chairman
Department of History

(Editors’ note: this is the Oct. 17,
letter sent by Seymour Drescher.).

Dear Editor:
WE’RE NUMBER ONE!

The most recent issue of The
Chronicle of Higher Education has
just awarded a_ new honor to our
state. Its front page headlines the

I Role Of Campus Media

I am responding to Walter

Burke’s criticism of The Pitt News

4 in the Feb. 6 issue. While I would
never criticize Burke’s right to
opinion, I do take exception to the
target.

Alright,The Pitt News isn’t the
New York Times--but neither is the
Boise Herald or the Cleveland Plain
Dealer. It 'is simply a school
newspaper, which serves this
capacity with limited resources.
While I, too, often ﬁnd articles that
would interest only pig farmers in
Butte, it still strives to present the
news as it sees it. The editorial on
the tuition hike, for example, is an
excellent case of journalism in any
league.

But, my dear Mr. Burke-- to

criticize The Pitt News .for not
inciting school interest? I don’t
believe that’s their job, is it?
Perhaps the next headline should
read, “Tuition Rate Hike Expected
--But Isn’t It Worth It?”
The job of creating interest is the
responsibility of other student
organizations--say, the Student
Government Board.’ We haven’t
heard much from the SGB recently.
Hey, did you and the rest of the
SGB return from that trip to
Monroeville yet? I think I read

about that little junket in The Pitt ‘

Housman in reply to her letter pub-
lished in Feb. 9 issue of The Pitt
News.)t. —

Dear Linda:

Chancellor Posvar has asked me
to respond to your letter of January
22, I981, concerning the editorial
that appeared in The Pitt News on
Monday, January I2. Unfortu-
nately, as is_sometimes the case, the
editorial did not fully explain the
University’s position with respect to
the proposed parking garage on the
Schenley Plaza lot. '

For many years, it has been the

‘ University‘s view that the ideal long-

term development of the Schenley

Plaza should permit its use as a.

pedestrian park to improve the qual-
ity of life in the areaand to providea
strong linkage among‘ the major
institutions in Oakland. I am sure
most people would agree that the
present parking lot does not repres-
ent an attractive or optimal use of

this important open area. It has been
our contention," therefore, that the

City should provide parking ade-

only state with a single-digit percen-
tile increase. We also learn that we
are also number one in terms of
ground lost to inflation. Pennsylva-
nia’s higher education is the only one
whose loss of purchasing power for
1978 to 1980 comes out in double
digits.

In this league you don’t get top

The Parking Position  

quate to meet the needs of the Uni-
versity and other institutions in
other locations in theOakland area.
A number of more suitable sites for a
parking garage have been suggested
to City Planning. ‘

In respect to the proposed Schen-
ley Plaza parking garage, if it is not
possible to provide adequate park-
ing elsewhere in the Oakland area,
the City’s proposal certainly repres-
ents an improvement over the pres-
ent arrangement for parking i in
Schenley Plaza. Our principal con-
cern, however, has been with the
traffic patterns that would be
created in and around the university
as a result ofthis proposal. It would
make Bigelow Boulevard between
the Cathedral of Learning. and
Schenley Hall a major, relatively
high speed ‘traffic artery channeling
heavy traffic from Bigelow Boule-
vard and the downtown area to
Schenley Park and Squirrel Hill.
That would createextreme hazards
for students, faculty, and staff.

We have told City Planning that

I any solution to the Schenley Plaz_a

parking problem must insure min-
imal hazard for pedestrians. We are

draft picks next year for ending up
as the champion losers. A heavy sus-
tained campaign in the legislature
must begin now, not next spring,
when the time again rolls around to
take our place at the end of the line.

Pitt Comes Off Close Call
 With Cleveland State

By MIKE DICHIARA

Pitt News Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers. fresh off a 73-
70 victory over Cleveland State last
Saturday, will be hosting the Penn
State Nittany. Lions at the Field
House tonight at 8.

Pitt comes into the non-
conference game with an I I-9 over-
all record, 5-3 in the Eastern Eight
Conference. This is the Panthers‘
last game of the season that will not
count toward the conference stand-
ings. ’Following Penn State,the
Panthers will play conference foes
Duquesne, George Washington,
West Virginia, Massachusetts and
Rutgers.

It would be easy to say, then, that
tor;ight’s game will be a bit of a
breather before the conference bat-
tles and the Eastern Eight tourna-
ment in early March. But tonight’s
opponent is Penn State, and a game
with the Lions is never a breather.

Penn State dropped out of the
conference two years ago, but there
is still an intense rivalry between the
Lions and the Panthers. The two
teams have played some dandy ball
games in the past.

Pitt’s major problem during the
season may have been finally solved.
On more than one occasion in the
past, Pitt had been unable to recover
when an opponent rallied late in a
game. However, in last Saturday’s
game, Pitt calmly put down a Cleve-
land State comeback to preserve a
three-point win.

The Panthers are a good basket-
ball team butjust have not played up
to their potential as a team. There

The Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt men’s volleyball team
traveled to the Ohio State Invita-
tional this weekend, but they didn't
enjoy the visit.

Competing against some of the
best Midwestern teams, the Panth-
ers went into the tournament hoping
to make it into the semiﬁnals; but
instead were handed an early depar-
ture ticket via a third-place finish in
their five-team pool with a 2-2 match
record.

Ball State took mg: in the pol,
with Pitt originally knotted in a
three-way tie with Winnepeg and the
University of Cincinnati for second
and the final slot in the semi-final
round. Winnepeg, Canada‘s fifth
ranked team, advanced to the
second round of play by virtue ofthe
tournament tie-breaker system
based on games won, dropping Pitt
to third and out of the competition.

have been some outstanding individ-
ual performances during the season,
such as Sam Clancy’s l6 points and
I6 rebounds against Cleveland
State.

Pitt finally got some scoring bal-
ance against the Vikings by having
five players end up in double figures:
Clancy, Lennie McMillian, Steve
Beatty, Carlton Neverson and
Dwayne Wallace.

Despite the rivalry with Penn
State, Pitt will have to make sure
that it doesn’t get caught looking
ahead. The game after Penn State is
against Duquesne at .
Arena. The ‘two teams _played a
fiercely intense game at the Field
House a week ago, and the Dukes
recently defeated West Virginia to
move within a game of the second-
place Mountaineers.

League-leading Rhode lsland also
lost to St. Bonaventure, thus closing
the gap between the top teams in the
league. The Rams seemed as if they
were poised to make a track race of
the standings and run away and
hide. However, it now appears that
there will be a dog fight for the top
four positions, which will decide the
home court advantage for the preli-
minary round of the Eastern Eight
tournament.  ‘ ‘

Pitt is presently in fourth place,

only a half‘game ahead offifth-place

Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights will
play Massachusetts tonight, and if
they win--something that will not be

a surprise--Rutgers will be in a vir-

tual tie for fourth place.

If the Panthers can get by rival
Penn State, it will be to their advan-
tage. A win would provide the

momentum they need to carry them ’

into the toughest and most impor-
tant part ofthe schedule thus farthis
year.

Winnepeg drubbed George Mason
University in the consolation match
in three games to finish third.

Even though theteam didn‘t reach
their semi-ﬁnal round goal, head
coach Ray Reilly was encouraged by
the Panthers quality of play.

“We played some excellent
matches against the more estab-
lished teams like Ball State, consid-
ering the stage our program is in,”
said Reilly. “Our serving this week
was excellent, and our passing
attack is already working at the
range you usually hope to achieve by
the end of the season.“

Pitt started slowly in the competi-
tion, bowing to Winnepeg in the first
match, I3-l5 and I2-l5. Reilly said
that overall, the team played well
but fell into a few mental lapses that
allowediwinnepeg to reel off several
scoring streaks.

4

Reilly must have felt a ‘little deja
vu after the Panthers second mateh-
a three-game loss Ball State.’ The
Panthers have a‘ history of slow
starts" in tournament play and this

State I5-I0, 4-l5,and l2-l5. Reilly
said the Panthers played an excel-
lent match but Ball State's strqnger
offense was the difference, com-
bined with the hitting problems that
were to plague Pitt throughout the

_ invitational.

°‘O'ur hitting attack hurt us. We
were getting our shots blocked a lot
and we didn‘t get the kills that we
should»’ve had,“ said Reilly. As a
young team which starts a freshman
and three sophomores,‘ Reilly said
that phase of the game should
improve for the Panthers with expe-
rience as theseason continues.

Pitt finally got things rolling
against
the match easily, 15-4, and l5-5.
Sophomore setter Dave Baird, who
Reilly said excelled all weekend, ran
the offense well by spreading out the
attack, but the key to the match was
the Panthers’ serving game which
strung together several scoring
sprees. ' ~

The Pitt serving "attack shone

against Cincinnati. The Panther

ing advantage of their weak passing
game, Pitt rebounded from a first-

A Pantherette rally in the second
hzlf fell four points short as Villan-
ova defeated Pitt, 60-56. The loss
dropped the Pantherettes’s record
15-5. Tonight Penn State’s Lady
Lions will invade the Field House in
what is probably Pitt’s biggest game
of the year.

The Lady Wildcats outshot the
Pantherettes .'7—l 1 in the first 20
minutes. Although Pitt held a slight
.5-2 edge from the’frc.e-throw line, it
was not enough to overcome the big

guns of the Lady Wildcats. Villan-.

ova held a 36-27 lead going into the
locker room.

The Lady Wildcats froze in the

-second half, hitting only 20 percent

of their shots from the floor. Mean-
while,_the Pantherettes were slicing
away the lead, sinking 13 field goals
in the second 20 minutes of play.
Since both teams hit 24 field goals in
the contest, the outcome ofthe game
.w;-is once again decided at the char-
ity stripe. While Pitt managed only 8
of 1.‘ frebies, Villanova shot 12 for
17 from the foul line.

Pam Miklasevich led the Pan-
therettes with 15 points. Debbie
Lewis added 11 markers and Gail
Aughburns pulled down 14
rebounds in a losing cause. Lisa
Ortlip led Villanova with 18 points
and 17 rebounds, both game highs.
Lady Wildcats Nancy Bernhardt
and Kathie_Beisel contributed 13

and 12 tallies respectively.

The Pitt-Penn State series stands
knotted at 6-6 going into tonight’s
contest. The last.Pitt victory came in
the 1980 Pitt Invitational, a 58-45
victory that catapulted the Pan-
therettes into the top 20. However,
the Lady Lions came back to defeat
Pitt, 68-48, in the regular season
meeting. The last meeting between
these rivals was in the first round of
the EAIAW playoffs. Penn State
soundly thrashed the Pantherettes
89-61.

Tonight, the Pantherettes seek to
avenge that loss. Penn State brings

"with" it a 17-5 record and four players

scoring in double digits. The Lady
Lions are led by Carol Walderiiian,
who averages 18.5 points a game.

‘Walderman is supported by Cheryl

Between'the months of November
and March, anyone can follow the
brick.road to the home of Pitt bas-
ketball. What they will ‘find is Deb-
bie Lewis, the reigning wizard of
Fitzgerald Fjeldhouse. ”At 5’ 2",
Debbie is the best point-guard in the
country,” according to the Pan-
therette coaching staff;

Lewis, a junior from Willow
Grove (near Philadelphia), is des-
tined to be one of the most prolific
performers in Pantherette basket-
ball history. Last year, as a sopho-
more, Lewis began rewriting the
record book. Scoring 548 points,
Lewis surpassed Wanda ‘Ran-
dolph vs mark of 500 for most points
in a sophomoreiseason. Lewis also
smashed Kathy Paczkowski*s sea-
son assist record of 117, setting the

‘new mark at 165. Finally, Lewis
Q established season (78) and game (9)
records for steals.

These are the type_of statistics that
usually attract All-America status.

‘However, this is one honor that has

eluded the Pantherette co-captain.
"l really don't care,” said Lewis.

"l’m not here to win personal

awards.” '

Recruited by former coach Jean
Balthaser, .Lewis came to the Pan-
therettes in 1977. Her freshman»sea-

assists, a record that still stands.

Women Gymnasts Beat Clarion For Win

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Sports Editor

The Pantherette gymnastics team
defeated Clarion by a score of
138.45-131.45 for its seventh consecu-
tive victory of the season. Pitt's 7-0
record is the best start the team has
ever had.

Pitt came into the meet with two
of its top performers hampered by
leg injuries. Lisa Shirk, ranked No.1
in the nation in all-around going
into the meet, and Bonnie Tressler
‘were restricted in their perform-
ances.

Despite the adversity, the rest of
the team picked up the slack and

ln vaulting, Karen Martin scored
a 9.2 for doing a vault which con-
sisted ofa full twist on the horse and
a full twist off. Lori Miller (8.85),
Gretchen Speich (8.6) and Holly
Martino (8.55) also turned in strong
performances for Pitt.

On the uneven bars, Shirk turned
in a brilliant performance and
scored a 9.55, the high score for Pitt

during the competition. Martin
(8.75), Tressler (8.45) and Speich
(7.3) rounded out Pitt's ﬁeld of
competitors.

Coach Donna Sanft was particu-
larly pleased with the Pantherettes
showing on the balance beam. Not a
single Pitt girl fell off the beam.
Shirk led the Pitt parade with a 9.35.
Regina Carson scored a 8.75 and
Martino scored a 8.7 Martin (8.5)

percent healthy in two weeks, but
until then, the back-up performan-
ces by Speich, Karen Zandi and
Roxann Evans were good enough to -'
keep the Pantherettes on their win-
ning streak.

According to Sanft, the impres-
sive won-lost record is good for _ 5
school pride. However, when
nationals come, it is the scoring
average that qualifies the team,
Sanft said. Thus Pitt must continue
to score high as it did this past
weekend. ,

The next meet is tonight at
Slippery Rock. The team will also
compete Saturday at 2 p.m. against
Michigan and Eastern Michigan at
