Rentals Rare in the Listing Business

five times and advertised it in The_

By LINDA MILLER

Pitt News Staff Writer

Fri., March 20, 1981—Since l
rode the wrong bus to Wilkinsburg,
I had to walk almost a mile in a wet
snowfall before I found the office of
the Bill Scott Co.

Fluorescent letters spelled out the
words “houses, rentals, apartments"
on the plate glass window. Walking
inside, I notice that the only furnish-
ing in the carpeted, paneled store-
front room was a large map of

. Pittsburgh that hung on a wall.

A man named Steve greeted me
from a doorway at the back of the
room. 1 explained to him that l was
interested in some ofthe apartments
they had advertised in Friday’s Pitt
News. _

Steve told me that the Bill Scott

.;c...:‘-.-v

wards was older. He also told me
that when a listing’s phone number
was whited out or deleted, it meant
that the property had already been
taken. '

Steve then stressed that while
every effort is made to keep the list-
ings current. there is no guarantee
that listings are all available at the
time you receive them.

I told Steve I'd like to buy the list
and asked ifa personal check would
be okay. He asked if l had any cash
at all. Telling him I had only enough
for the bus back to Oakland, Steve
said to write the check to cash.

When l wrote the check out to the
Bill Scott Co., Steve made a phone

call to the manager to have ‘my check

approved. ,
Afterwards, he wished me luck
and reminded me to stop in periodi-I
cally for new listings. '
On the bus ride back to Oakland, l

Co. is a listing agency that would put

landlord and keep the other.

A security deposit, which is required by most landlordsfis to cover
non-payment of rent or any damage the tenant does to the apartment
beyond the normal wear and tear caused by every day living.

/Under the law, a security deposit cannot exceed an amount equal to
two months’ rent during the first year. At the beginning of the second
year, the amount cannot exceed one month’s rent. ' ,

To protect a security deposit, the Bureau of Consumer Protection
suggests that before moving into an apartment, a tenant go through it
thoroughly and list any and all damages. Further, the bureau advises
the tenant to prepare this list in duplicate, date it, and request the
landlord to sign‘ both copies. Then thetenant should give a copy to the

A state law also protects a tenant’s security deposit by requiring that
a landlord provide within 30 days after a tenant leaves, a list of'any
damages which the landlord claims the tenant is liable for and a refund
of the security deposit less the cost.of the repairs on the written list.

If the landlord fails to provide the list and the refund within 30 days,
he cannot sue the tenantof any damages he‘ claims are owed him.
Moreover, the tenant can sue the landlord and recover double the
difference between the amount ofthe security deposit and damages to
the apartment which the landlord can prove. L _ A

However, the tenantforfeits the rights this law offers if he or she
does not give the landlord, in writing,,a forwarding address.

me in “direct contact with the land-
lord.” He also explained that
because they have over 400 listings
in the Pittsburgh area, I should be
able to find exactly what I wanted-
Steve also added that most of the

landlords prefer to list with them '

and usually do not list in newspaper
ads. .
He told me the fee the Bill Scott
Co. charges for their services is
$44.50. This, Steve explained, would
entitle me to a year’s worth of new

I listings and ifat theend ofthe'year,I ,
~ have not found an apartment, he

said my money would be refunded.

I asked a few more questions, then
Steve explained how to use the l0-
page list. He told me that the first
page contained the most current
vacancies and that each page after-

found that three of the l2 listings

their phone ‘numbers deleted from

Back in Oakland, I called three
listings in the oakland area and
learned from the landlordsthat they

‘ advertised in the Pittsburgh Press

and as a result, the Bill’ Scott Co.
called them and offered free listings.

One landlord told me I could have ' i

saved‘ myself a lot_ of money if llhad
bought a newspaper.
When I called anotherlisting that

was advertised in The Pitt News, the '
’ landlord told‘ me that the apartment

had been taken for three weeks and
that l was the fourth person to call
that day. T f g

or six times. asking if the property

a was still available and he said he‘d

told her it was not.

I also learned that the property
was advertised in the Press before
the Bill Scott Company contacted
the landlord. However, the landlord

added that the response with the Bill ,

Scott Co. listing was much better
than the newspaper ad:

The same landlord told me that he _

didn’t get any of the $44.50 fee and
before he hung up, gave me the
phone number of a landlord who
may have an apartment available.

Sat., March 2l—lt’s like adding
salt tolthe wound. when l learned
from a -phone call that the woman
had never heard of-the-Bi-ll ScottCo.
and had no idea how her property
had gotten listed.

She said she‘couldn‘t believe that

' the Bill Scott Co: charged someone--

$44.50 for a list and asked me for
their phone number. (l learned later
that she listed her property with the
A. Shy Co., which is affiliated with
Bill Scot Co.) ' _

At this point my curiosity was
raised, so I decided to put the Bill
Scott Co. to a test.

.Stuffing my cheeks with cotton

(so my voice wouldn’t sound famil-
iar), I called the Bill Scott,Co. I read
a listing advertised in The Pitt News
to a man and asked if it was still

’ available. He told me he‘d have to
check and asked me if he could call.

me back. 0 _

lsaid yes, but when he asked my
name I hesitated, thinking that they
may recognize my name from yester-
day, so l said my name was Debbie
Haines.

While waiting for the Bill Scott
Co. to call me back, the questions
that ran through my head included:
“Why am I impersonating a chip-
munk?” and, “I wonder ifthis is how
Woodward and Bernstein got

. started?”

«The phone rang. and the voice
identified himself as Chris. He told
me that the property lwas interested
in was still available. However, the
list that sat on my lap had the exact
same ‘listings phone number
deleted. , . ‘ ~ .

Chris told me that there were sev-

eral other properties available in the

same area and that l was looking at
the right time. Again I heard the
words “direct contact with landlord”
and “full-money back guarantee.”
Chris did throw in something new,

v_ when he explainedthat the-Bill Scott

Co. is part of the_Citico Data Pro-
cessing Co.,

After the operator told me she had‘

no li_sting for the Citico Data Pro-
cessing Co., l decided it was safe «to
remove the cotton andcall it a‘ day.

Sun., March 22-1 called the stu-
dent ‘who first referred The Pitt

story. i ‘

the Bill Scott Co., the student tells
me that when she dialed the phone
number later, she found out that it
had been disconnected.

V Further, the student tells me that

' she was able to stop payment on her
check at a cost of $l0 and that she 

did find an apartment. However, she
adds that it was not through the Bill
Scott Co., but through her landlord.

After l hung up, l dialed the
number she gave me for the manager
of the Bill Scott Co. and listened to a
‘monotone voice say, “The number

While finding an apartment to
rent is usually a time-consuming,
frustrating and difficult under-
taking for most students, the
Bureau of Consumer Protection
offers help with guidelines and
tips in its “Consumer Protection
Handbook." ~

First, the bureau suggests that
a person compile a list ofavaila-
ble apartments by checking with
friends and newspaper ads.
Sources available to Pitt stu-
dents include the classified ads of
Pittsburgh’s daily newspapers;
the Pitt News, and the Off-
Campus Housing Office located
in the basement ofthe Student
Union. 5 ' A

The bureau also recommends

» the use of real estate agencies in
compiling the list’, but it suggests",
that a person “be cautious”when
using the services of rental listing-
agencies. It describes
agencies as “agencies that for».a_
$30-$40 fee offer you a listof
apartments exactly—so they
say—-suited _to your speciﬁca-
tions. Often these agencies take
your moneywithout providing

According to’ the Bureau of
Consumer Protection, these mis-

long .lists of properties_that are

Larson said that dialogue and

Larson praised Walt Disney for

While discussing “The Fox and

challenges was animating ~a-nv-owl

Animation for a film is done by a
team, according to Larson. Three or
four persons are responsible for
developing the characters, and it is
“impossible for one personto do all

as a person being an island unto

aim was to have a bird with a human
personality, rather than just a
human in aniowl suit.

When asked why the quality ‘of

time and money are among the limit-

'Gun Control. With’ every successful and unsuccessful
attempt on the life of a publicﬁgure, the issue ofgun control
is re-introduced into‘ the limelight. And, with a proper pas-

sage of time, the issue is again buried. -

There is, of course, t=he_right to beararrris, and the rallying
cry that “guns don’t kill, people do,” but this ,is a poor
defense for aipitiful problem_. Of course peoplekill. But they
may kill lessoften and with less efficiency if highly accesible
handguns were removed from their grasp.

One/gets a frightened and sickened feeling upon hearing of
violence similar to that which occured on Monday. It is the
same feeling that occured at thelnews of John Lennon’s
murder, or the murder of San Fransisco mayor George
_Moscone. Why is this issue smothered? Although the gun

control fires are currently" rekindling, it isa safe bet that once
again the matter will be swept under the rug until there IS

another fatal or near-fatal incident.

The right to bear arms has strongisupporters throughout. A

this country. But the possession of a handgun is an unneces-
sary luxury. There is no security in the owning of one. What
the public wants the right to own for their own defense is
_used against them and their leaders timeand again.-

The ease in acquiring a handgun is equal to that ofgetting

a driver’s license. How secure can ‘a ptiblic feel knowing that
_their worst fearsare armed and walking in the streets? How .
manymore people must be shot dead in the streets, 'or their
homes before. gun control is properly instituted? _ ‘ g

The answer to this question is as tragic as the crimes.
There is obviously little chance of gun controlin the near
future. Even with the attempt on the life of a president, the
issue will die away’ until another weapon weilding person V
decides that murder is-tllcconly way to etch themselves in
history; in the public eye. - v A ~_ I A -'

And7rom this, an even stronger, more fatal question must .

I- be asked.‘ If it won’t' stop. with,_the shooting of a president, _ "A if

when will it stop?

StateRep:. ’We AreOn Your Sid:e'T

Dear Editor:

On behalf of the Allegheny
County Republican Delegation, l
‘welcome this opportunity toladdress
the students, faculty and administra-
tion of the University of Pittsburgh
on the subject of the I98]-82 state
budget and, specifically, the appro-
priation proposed, for Pitt.

These are very troubled financial
times. . Double-digit inﬂation _is_

strangling everyone--businesses, ’

labor, students and government on
all levels. Recognizing this, Gpver-
nor Thornburgh has submitted what
I think is a very responsible, cost-
conscious state budget. The budget,
representing an overall increase of’5
percent ._(less than half the inflation
rate), is, in the governor's words, “a
tough budget for tough times.’.’ The

the governor hopes that this in some
small way will ease the burden ofour
already overburdened taxpayers in
this Commonwealth.

The’ governor has stated--and I
wholeheartedly agree--that this

tough budget serves the needs of all _
segments of our population in the ‘

most equitable way. As a member of
the House Appropriations'Commit-
tee, l know the fiscalproblems we
face." They include losshof massive
' amounts of federal funds and dwin-
dling revenue resources. This budget
will not make everyone happy.
A lncreases in welfare and other

social services, transporta,tion,- cegu- \

latoryl agencies and education have
all been called inadequateby some

' special interest"or anotherg: v
In_studying the proposed budget, -‘

which we in the General Assembly
must pass by June 30, I, myself have
found areas where I would like to

-The University of Pittsburgh, as
part of the Commonwealth System

« of Higher Education, is one of our

greatest potential tax-producing
resources in‘ the Commonwealth.
The students hold;the key to Pen-

‘ nsylvania’s economic and cultural

future. The state legislature deeply
recognizes this, as it contributes over
30 percent of the entire operating
budget of the university in state
appropriations. Even so, many of
-you know this may not ~be'.enough.

Pitt has _ its own inflationary
problems. _ -
In 1980-81 Pitt received

$7l,069,000 in stateappropriations.
The governor has proposed the
amount of $74,553,000 for l'98 l-82--
roughly a 5 percent increase. Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar, at his recent
hearing before the House Appropri-

— budget calls for no new taxes, and . ations Committee in Harrisburg,

stated that the governor‘s proposal
was simply not enough for the uni-
versity to meet,_its expenses without
an increase in tuition. He said, as I
am sure he has told you, that tuition
would increase at roughly the rate of
inflation (Lf. %) if the Governor’s'
budget is adopted as is by the Gen-'
eral Assembly. '

: Dr. Posvar made a passionate and
convincing request before our com-
mittee for more dollars over the gov- E
er'nor'_s proposal. " ‘Approximately.
$84 ‘million would be needed, he

said, if tuition rates were- to be held -
‘constant.lThis represents an l8.2 .
percent increase over I980-81 ‘state . .
funding, and is aPPT0ximately $9,5 ,

"million more than the Governor’s7¥

balanced propiosed,b_udget.: A _

What this meansyisthat we as leg-
islators in our budget ‘deliberations
mus;t find.$9.5 million from some
other state-funded items to give to

see -increases. The same, holds true‘ Pitt. What makes this even more dif- '

.,for most of my-colleagues‘. But in
order to do this with an already.fru-
gal _budget, we must guard against

think you would agree as taxpayers’
that it is not the will of the people at
this-‘time to raisetaxes. . '

Pitt News Sports Writer

lWhen the Panther men’s volley-
ball team is in need of support, both

on a_nd off the court, the man that .

they lookto for direction, the one

« they depend on to have control of

the ballgame is their sophomore
blocker, Bill Knuth. The man who is
referred to by his coach, Ray Reilly,
as the “quiet team leader” had
gained the respect of his teammates
for his fine play, although he is only
in his second year of organized play
in the sport.

“He has a stabilizing effect on the
entire team,” said Reilly. “I look at

. him as a quiet team leader. He relies

on his confidence more than his ver-

' bal game.” ’

The 6-foot-2 Knuth came to Pitt

after a bit of misfortune at Wright b

State Collegein Ohio. He had been

' recruited out of Plum High School

but found out two days before leav-
ing for college that the volleyball
coach had resigned and that the pro-
gram might be eliminated entirely
from the varsitylsehedule. Knuth
went to Wright State but soon left
before the first term was up, because

there was no team in sight.

Knuth had played only one full
year of high school ball because of
illnesses in his first two high school
seasons. .

‘Knuth’s Plum team was highly
regarded. In his senior season, he
and the team battled into the finals

ofthe Western Pennsylvania confer- I
‘ ence title game against current Pitt

teammate. Dave Baird.
“He had a late start in volleyball
because of high school; and then he

sat ou_t that year at Wright State‘

before thinking about Pitt,” said
Reilly. “But in his first year with its.
we had to redshirt _him. This season I

consider him to ‘be one of the,

stronger middle blockers and hit_ter‘s

to be a member of the" Panther
squad. Notulntil after "three fights
that did not end until February,
I980, three weeks into the season,
did the NCAA give their final no.
Knuth was quite disappointed for

the second year in a row but,did not .

‘lose his determination to continue
seeking a collegiate career in the
sport. '

“I was discouraged about the I

always wanted to play very much,

During the time between Wright

Spikers No.3 Ranking to be  
  Tested at George Mason

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt Panther men’s volleyball
team will embark on a most impor-
tant weekend when they leave for
George Mason University this after-
noon. Pitt will face George Mason in
a best-of-five match this evening.
The team will then compete tomor-
row in the third annual George
Mason Invitational Tournament.
Both events find the Panthers facing

‘ some very tough competition.

Pitt is currently ranked third in
Division I of the Eastern Collegiate
Volleyball League (ECVL), behind
Penn State and Rutgers respec-

tively. Following 'the Panthers /

closely are George-Mason and East
Stroudsburg. Both will be vying for

the top spot in Saturday's
tournament. 1
,More importantly ‘will be

_tonight's match with George Mason.
Pitt defeated George Mason in the
ﬁnals of the ECVL Open Tourna-
ment two weekends ago in New Jer-

sey. The Pathers had also disposed I

of the George Mason spikers earlier
that day in league competition; A

George. Mason will be looking
quite intently at knocking off the

Panthers" in their ‘fourth meeting of _

the season..The_two teams opened
up the 1980 seasonconference with
the Panthers winning the match,
four games to one. ,

. ‘‘I think that we should.have an

advantage seeing them tonight

in USVBA tournaments and a beach
tournament last summer in Virginia.
“I saw him play once this past

3- summer and it was hard to believe

that lwas going to play with such a
high caliber player this year," said
Panther‘ first-year tman, Mike
Petock. “I consider~him. our money
-hitter; he’s,worth a_Iot.” _
Teammate Scott Robbins, a Vete-

ran of all three Panther varsity sea- .
sons thinks Knuth is one of the most .

reliable hitters on the team.

. “He’s the one that you look to in
clutch situations. He has a-high per-.
centage as a hitter. Plus his passing is
consistently on. ‘target and his
defense hasrimpro/ved so much. He
seems to be pushing harder and
working a lot on his play.” _

This weekend Knuth and the
Panthers will face George Mason in
a conference match to be followed
by the "George Mason Invitational
Tournament Saturday. He should
figure to bea big part in the Panthers
success throughout the two days-

“I think that he is one of the best
‘middle blockers in the East,’”_ said

, Pitt teammate -Dave Mitas..“Hehas

carried us through a few games with
his hitting and he knows how to con-
trol through his game.” '

before tomorrow’s tournament,”
said Pitt’s Gary Groshner. “We’Il be

used to playing on their court, which

should give us an edge against the
other competition on Saturday. If
we play up to our potential, we
should win both days. It will be
important because they will be after
us since beating them in the ECVL
finals.”

A win over Goerge Mason,
coupled with a good showing the
following day, will do a great deal to
help secure the Panthers’,bid to be
seeded third in the Easterns, pldyed
later in the month at Penn State. Pitt
would still need a win over Army in
their ﬁnal home contest April II,
but success this weekend would be a
fine start. ' A

“Friday will be a big match,” said -

Pitt coach Ray Reilly. “They're
tough to play at home, so I expect to
see agood match, although I am
conﬁdent enough to say that I think
that we will win. _We have to play
well, though," I -

I “this matchup has developed into-

quite some rivalry over the years,”
Reilly said. “There are a lotof Pitts-
burgh kids on their team, which
explains part of the riv.aIry.b,etween
the two teams. Also, I thialuhat’ it is

due to. the fact that we have gro'vi/n~
"up in the ECVL withthem. Their‘

program is only a few years older
than ours. These have made this

thing develop into a, fierce rivalry.” ,
Pitt will be one of the favorites .-

The Panther men‘s indoor soccer
team will compete in its ﬁnal tourna-
ment of the season when it plays in
the highly competitive second

"annual Carnegie-Mellon Invita-

tional Tomorrow.

The_Panthers will play in the first

 'brack-etnof the day, set to begin at 8

a.m._in the CMU gymnasium. There
will be two pools of seven teams,
with the top two teams in each‘
advancing into the final rounds of
competition to be played later in the
day. Pitt’s league play will consist of
such rivals from outdoor season as
Bethany and Grove City, as well as
Slippery Rock alum'ni team.

The Panthers have been success-
ful in their indoor season to date.
After a poor showing in the Indiana
Invitational over a month ago, Pitt
took top honors at the Youngstown
Tourney in early March and came in
second the following weekend in the
Grove City Tournament. The
Panthers, behind the tough goal-
keeping of Scott Thunberg, put in a
number of goals in all three tourna-

   

 sows-ream
Indoors at Carnegie-Mellon

 

mentsand hope to do the same this’
weekend.

“We'll be looking at~some very
tough competition at CM U, so we
must be aware of our goal scoring.“
said starter Eric Tiedtke. “We will
need to put a lot of balls in the net. In
order to do that, we are going to

have to communicate out there and _

turn a lot of plays into goals.“

Tiedtke had a productive day at
Grove City with ‘seven assists and
two goals. Teammate Tom Trempus
also came on strong to place six balls
past the opposing goalkeepers.

The Panthers came in second
place at the CMU Invitational last
season and team member Al» Adel-
mann was. named to the All-
Tournament ‘squad. Goalkeeper
Thunberg preserved three shutouts
throughout the day.

“Our indoor season had been very
much of a learning process as it is
every year,“ said Thunberg. “It will
aid us tremendously in the outdoor
season next fall. It has definitely
improved people’s. play as is evident
by our first two tournaments at
Youngstown .and Grove City. I
thought we did very well those two

weekends."

CMU sports a large indoor gym,
and the Panthers will have to get
used to playingon it immediately.
However, Pitt does have an advan-
tage over some other teams because
the team has played on this floor a
number of times in practice
situations.

The Panthers will be at a disad-
vantage, though if they qualify for
the playoffs. After playing six games
in the first bracket in the morning,
they will have to wait until ll p.m.
before starting playoff action.

“That’s hard tohave a break that
long,“ said Pitt’s Jerry Burige.
“Once you warm up, things go well.
But after sitting for hours,,you get
tired and stiff and have to start all
over again. Whoeveriwins the after;
noon section will be coming right _off
their games and should have an
advantage." ' ~

Pitt still remains optimistic for the
tournament and has a" shot to bring
first-place honors back to the Pitt
campus this season. ' ’

“This tournament should be a
tough one because we will be facing
better competition than we have in
