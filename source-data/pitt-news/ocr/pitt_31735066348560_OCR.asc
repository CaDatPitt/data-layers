2,500 students for graduation, a mammoth project
precluding an extension of viewing hours, but according to
Assistant CAS Dean Robert Marshall, a change of policy
may be in the ofﬁng. »

‘e  Though students aren’t exactly breaking down the doors
to see the documents, more than a few have protested the

Survey Studies Quality of Lite

BY DOUG GEBHARD
The quality of life in Oakland is
the subject of a survey now being
conducted by Pitt’s Center for

Urban Research (CUR) in response

to a memo from Chancellor Wesley
W. Posvar. _

According to CUR’s director Jiri
Nehnevvajsa, quality of life studies
have always been an underlying
theme of the center.

The center decided to redirect its
emphasis to the Oakland -area
because of the Chancellor’s memo
which stated, “The University has

an obligation and also a need to

Tuition, $890 for a double dorm
room, and $596 for a full meal plan,
adds up to $3,486 per year. s

The median family’ income of
entering freshmen in 1974, on all
Pitt campuses, has been estimated
at $13,239 per year. Sending a
student to Pitt would post roughly
one-fourth of that income. And
that is without a tuition increase.

Financial aid, of course, absorbs a
good portion of this sum for many

South Oakland.”
In a previous survey by CUR, 16

city neighborhoods were polled to \

determine citizen satisfaction with
city services, noise conditions, air
quality and sewage disposal.
Nehnevajsa explained the survey
to be taken this week will be

‘random, stressing Oakland resi-

dents’_needs. A future question-
naire will deal strictly with’ the
needs‘ of University students,
investigating such problems as

others. .

“We see our role as providing

problems,” said Nehnevajsa,” not
necessarily alleviating them. Mine
is primarily a research role, but we
will be asking for suggestions for
improvement.” The polling will be
done by his Sociology 177 class on

l

1974, 39.3% of freshman families
earned over that ﬁgure.

What this shows is a noticable
falling out of lower and middle-
income students here in the past
year, due unarguably to inﬂation
and recession. ,

The recent room and board
increase will probably raise this
figure, and a tuition hike would
undoubtedly up it greatly.

One can only guess, at this point,
how many students will be forced
to withdraw from the university if
tuition is raised the 10 or 20%
being rumored. But if low income
students are dropping out at a rate
of 7.3% already, things can’t be
expected to get much better.

Alf the University can make up for
this enrollment loss by accepting
more higher-income students, then
theoretically the tuition hike will
work--it will bring in. more money.

But, if enrollment just drops, on

‘all levels, the University will end
up with less money from tuition.

Queens College, in Charlotte, NC,
has decided to cut tuition $110 per
year, taking a markedly different

track. “We want to take advantage 9

of the basic principle that by
securing a greater number of
students a college can cut the
average cost per student,” Queens
president Alfred O. Cannon told an
interviewer recently.

Doing what Queens has done
would possibly harm the quality of

each students’ education by chang- 4

ing the faculty-student ratio, but
turning away qualiﬁed students
because they can’t pay and
accepting richer, less-qualified
students would also tend to lower
Pitt’s quality.

leased, and after the State
Legislature goes over it, the

which could be eliminated._There
was also a faculty concern about
the Buckley Amendment - which
may cause faculty to be less candid

‘when writing recommendations.”

Alexander stressed a pre-profes-
sional advisor will still be main-
tained for the health professions.
And any change will not be put into

effect untilnext August, no one will I

be cut off in midstream. .

Alexander said the students will
still have to collect recommenda-
tions from faculty plus other im-
portant information.'The folder wﬂl
just not go through the PPAC to get
summarized.

At the meeting Moye stated the
service the PPAC provides is
a good one, but it prescreens for
medical schools. It was these
schools he felt should pick up, the
tab for the committee. _

Moye said this committee serves a
small minority of the 20,000 stu-

“dents on this campus, which helps

lower its priority. He also empha-
sized all juniors will be processed,
regardless of whether the commit-
tee dissolves. I

Assistant Vice Chancellor for Stu-
dent Affairs, William Markus,
explained the f'mancial aspect of
the problem. _

“The Chancellor has announced a
$9.5 million cutback. Since we
don’t know how much the state will

provide and when, we are anticipa-
ting the worst. We all must become
more accountable in spending dol-
lars. Looking at what has been
done and continuing it is a luxury
we can no longer afford.‘ An across
the board cut of 10% is being
discussed. But we are planning for

the worst and things might not be

as bad.” '

Markus said the next move is to
get the facts and get the best
possible judgement. “We’ll be in
the face-gathering stage over the
next few weeks. We will accumu-
late student input but in the ﬁnal
analysis, it will be an administrative
decision.”

Moye and Markus expressed con-
cern over the practice of putting
recommendations into composite
letters. “Concerning the principle
of pulling the statements out of
context,” said Markus, “Can this
be objectively done?” V

Cowles, chairman of the seven-
member PPAC, felt an alternative

had to be developed but not the one

of eliminating the committee.
“Why would the axe fall on a
committee which is largely volun-
tary?” He advocates moving the
committee back to the CAS advis-
ing center since_virtually all pre-
meds are in the CAS.

“Pitt has to have the PPAC, it
would be shameful if we didn’t. It

is the exception, and not the rule if
a major university did not have a
committee like this.

“We are getting more students
accepted to more difficult schools.
Schools take these recommenda-

‘ tions seriously.”

Concerning Moye’s statement the
committee serves as a prescreening
process for medical schools Cowles
stated, “Absolutely nonsense! Any
screening is through advising. We
reject one in thirty for.._recommen-

dation but only 40% ofthose left _'

go on to medical school.” He added
the 40% ﬁgure goes along with the
national ‘average.

Cowles has had no trouble with

the Buckley Amendment, which V

allows students to, see previously
conﬁdential files. “We accept only
recommendations from faculty who
are willing to have students see
them. We even asked faculty to
sign a waiver permitting students
to see papers ﬁled before the
Buckley Amendment went into
effect. Virtually all of them co-

. operated.”

Cowles laid credit for the commit-
tee functioning on a reduced secre-

tarial staff on Student Services‘

Specialist Gerri Toth. “We can’t
function without her.” But Toth is
expected to leave before ’ July 1
since she‘ has been advised by
Gallagher, like Roberts was, to

  
  

year.

The president of Alpha Epsilonfjl
Delta, the pre-med honoraryefra.-"E
ternity; Randy Simonsen, suppor'tsf
the PPAC. “Most major schools
have a committee like this. Vltvrl

serves a needed function.

“After Monday night's meeting?’
we held an informal meeting. witlid
-_those students who remained:
polling took place where almost"all‘L_"
were against the dissolution ofthe

PPAC.”

. In an interview Moye explainedwjlr
the reasons why the PPAC" and. ,

Roberts were ',_being dropped. 

“Having one advisor for the _num-_ ' ;
erous graduate schools seems injef-V
ﬁcient. Money must be’ spentto do_-
the job more effectively. But there”

is no money to spend.”

Moye feels that committee services-
as a pre-screening device. “Along;
with making the composite recom- ’_
mendation the PPAC rates the _
student as enthusiastically recom-"I ‘

mended;strongly recommended;

recommended; recommended with 
reservation;and not recommend-" K’

ed."

“This rating is a pre-screening 
device. I believe those with the 
good rating have the credentials‘-_ 
anyway and would get accepted ‘ 
withoutthe help of the PPAC.” 1 J

Grading

Professors and administrators at
Pitt are on target in their debate

_over the spiraling quality point

average (QPA), a nation-wide
phenomenon. The problem is not
the rising QPA itself, but rather the
lack of an acceptable deﬁnition of

the purpose of grading.

Why the QPA has risen nationally
revolves around an intellectual
exercise among educators.

Proponents » of . the traditional’
meaning of the grading system like
William Keefe, political science
department chairman, argue that

the standardization of the. interpre-
’ tation of grades gives graduate
' schools a reliable

index of a
person’s capabilities. Without reli-
able grades, graduate schools must
depend on the Graduate Record
Exam (GRE) and academic recom-
mendations. , . " .

CAS. Dean Robert Marshall and
other professors have changed
their deﬁnition of grades. They see
the grading process, in Marshall’s

. words, “as developmental rather

than discriminatory, causing
growth rather than causing motiv-
ation.” _

‘ Becauseof this intraschool'philo-

sophical’ difference, there is no
uniformity of grading practice.

A student majoring in political‘
science or chemistry, for example,

' can have an overall 3.60 QPA, but

only a 3.10 in his major. Several
reason may__ contribute to this: the
student may have taken many
“cake” courses, or he- may, have

No Professionals

On Pitt Niewsstaﬁ

Gentlemen,

It has‘ come to my attention that
certain members of the Pitt News
student organization‘ have claimed
to be professional journalists. This
claim is suspect at best. Upon ‘what

basis is the claim of professional.

journalis hased other ‘than
perhaps personal gloriﬁcation?‘ Isl
this claim based upon.the fact that
you are paid for your work? If this
is. so, then any student who has
worked on a host_of jobs may lay
claim to professionalism. May I
claim to be aprofessional statistic-
P ian because for one.summer I was
paid for: compiling statistics for the

claim, but, perhaps,«that is because

Are you mfperhapsi professional

Perhaps you. are professionals
because of your journalistic ethics
which seem to be like unto the
credo of a pack of self-protecting
parasites rather than the ethics of
professionals. Of course, there is
the possibility that you . are
professional because you call
yourself that in which case the
Napoleons and Jesus Christs of the
asylums are also quite sane. Do you
possess degrees or credits or is this
unnecessary? ‘ .

If perhaps the cloud of the fourth

perhaps then you would come back

Alternative Needed

not worked very hard in his major.
But more likely the discrepancy is
a result of the traditional deﬁnition
of a grade in his major department.
That is ‘C’ means average work. A
This disagreement - over the
function of grades only hurts the
student who works hard for high
achievement. Should that person
want to enter graduate school, he’s_
under excessive‘ pressure to score
high on the GRE and obtain
excellent recommendations from
his faculty, hoping they have a
good reputation at the graduate
schools‘ to which he is applying. _
An informal suggestion to abolish
grades altogether by stipulating
each -professor submit‘ personal
evaluations on each student is

impractical because. of the large

number of collegians.

A similar notion suggests only
those students intent on graduate
work seek such evaluations. But
graduate schools complain the high
number of applications precludes
reading every report. Graduate‘

school administrators like grades

because at a quick glance they can
see theconsistency and caliber of
the student under consideration.
In any event, it’s clear the
intellectual ' . and philosophical de-
bate among educatorsi\is hurting
those students seeking admission
to_ graduate school. Without an

To the Editor, P ~
Last week, Gay Students at‘ Pitt

the Third Annual Humansecuality

‘ Conference at Pitt in the Student

Union. We ‘were distressed to ﬁnd
that a major event spanning-three
days received no coverage from the
Pitt News despite how well in-
' formed you were via a 1/3 'pa'ge_.ad
for the entire conference, and.
announcements for the individual

One of the major functions of Gay
. Students at Pitt is to educate the

public and particularly. the’ aca- '

minority persons. The H_umansex-

,.ction successfully. We presented‘

Elaine Noble, thelrecently elected,
openly gay, Massachusettes state
legislator; Albert Klassen, a re-
searcher from Kinsey Institute for
Research; the Reverend Troy. Per-
ry, founder of the Metropolitan

“If it keeps up like it’s going now,

_ “My own personal recommenda-

“But I rather suspect that Mr.

it’s Mr. Mclntosh who’s the budget

GSPA Critici

BY BILL MOORE

Graduate student complaints on
the method of negotiating the
student health plan were discussed
last night at a meeting of Graduate
Professional Student Association
(GPSA).

GPSA member Marc Heller told
fellow representatives no formal
contract exists between Pitt and

Blue Cross/ Blue Shield of Western .

Pennsylvania [BC/ BS].

“What exists is an exchange of
letters that were signed by various
university officials and BC/BS
saying in essence the university
accepts plan “B” of BC_/BS,”
Heller said. I

Heller -complained of a lack of
clear guidelines in the past on what
the student health plan covers.

“Instead,” he said, “students
contact the Blue Cross office and
are told if it is in the plan.”

Heller has asked for documenta-
tion of what the health plan will pay
for, and “that copies of the

‘ document be available and readily

accessible to anyone here at the
university.”

Rates for the health plan will
probably increase 50 to 75%
this year it the same plan is
accepted, Heller said. >

According to Heller, the specifics
of what is wanted in the health plan
are being mailed to various insur-
ance companies, including BC/BS,

creases next year. “A number of _
students would probably drop out

if tuition goes up much higher,” -'

Axten commented. .

He urged grad students to write
state legislators. “The University
already speaks for itself in Harris-

burg,"’ he said, “but the student '

voice is a much different one.
“The University has tried very
hard not to increase tuition for a
while, and I think that is genuine,
Axten said. But, he added he would
attempt to be included in decisions
should an increase become neces-
sity. _
GPSA members did not vote on

in 11013535 Of Obtaining the best ’specif1c proposals because of min-

agreement.
GPSA president Nick Axten raised
the issue of possible tuition in-

imal attendance at the evening
meeting.

The chief ﬂung open the door of

his office with the brusqueness of a_ _

military commander and faced his
audience of A a couple hundred
‘—f§j;‘_c‘pllege seniors, many of them
’-“” keeping a vigil outside his door
since the early hours _ of the
morning. His public snapped to
attention, stifling yawns- and
awkwardly shoving c‘ard decks into
pockets. The‘ squat chief in the
starched, white shirt counted off
six students as they passed into the
ofﬁceand stopped student number
seven with a restraining hand.
“Sign ’em up and take off,” he
commands as the students rush to
the interview schedules posted on
the long tables. The chief is Ernest
S. Holmok, Director of the Pitt

p supervises a nine-man staff that

mornings during the October to
April recruiting season, Ernest
Holmok is a familiar sight as he
maintains order and advises
students.

repeats Holmok as the ﬁrst three
students leave and he counts off
the next three in line.

that I want to go to - graduate

 ’¥'/"‘-varsity jacket reminiscent of high

school glory.
“You’ll only _kill yourself,” said
Holmok. “A company thinks of you
as an investment. If they hire you

“Can I mention to the interviewer -

they’ll want you to stay, they won’t
train you to leave them for more
schooling.” p

The student ruffled a sheaf of
papers explaining placement cen-
ter services. “Well, it says here
that we should make an appoint-
ment with you. Why should we
have an interview with you?”

Holmok tried to hide his grin in
the palm of his hand but failed as
the embarrassed student turned
redand shufﬂed his feet.

“So I’ can get to know you

student. * '

“You’re quite welcome, do come_

As the student walked away,
Ernest Holmok shook his head and
sighed. “They just don’t realize

seemed to attract an audience of

nervously perhaps. “Then they

have his appointment,” said the
senior.

“I’m sorry, but rules are rules,”
said Holmok, as the student walked
away.

“That’s a 3.7 engineer, and he’s
complaining,” said Holmok.
“Bright kid, but I can’t make
exceptions. These long lines in the
morning doesn’t exactly grab the
university, but there’s no other fair
way. As long as I’m here, everyone
will have ’the same opportunity to
sign up. I’ve been criticized right
and left by people. who don’t like to
hear the facts, but rules are rules.”

Ernest Holmok, 58, holds two
masters degrees in English and
Psychology from Pitt. When he
first came to work for the
placement center ﬁfteen years ago,
he brought with him a work
background in personnel relations,
sales management, and counseling
experience. Yet, the problems he
faces on these typical Monday
mornings are minor compared to
those he faces the other days of the
week. . -

“I’ll never forget one afternoon,”
said Holmok. “It was a classic, the
worst in my life. He paused,
fumbling in his pocket for his
cigarette pack and slowly lit a
cigarette. “Three people, all past
college grads, came to talk to me
about getting a job through the
center. One was a 55-year-old
schoolteacher who had his voice
box removed. I had to tell him there
wasn’t a job for him worthy of his
experience. Then I talked to a MS

victim, and no one, but no one, will-

touch that since it’s fatal. And’ to
top it all off, my next appointment
was a 48-year old minister who'no

longer felt the call.”

Holmok stopped and shook his
head in disbelief. “Now what
would you do? They’re so
optimistic, but the cold facts are
that no one wants any of them. I’ve
been criticized for being blunt, but
I won't sugar-coat the truth.”

As he spoke the lights in the
placement center went out and the
remaining handful of students
huddled closer to the sign-up
sheets. The long lines had
disappeared to a trickle, and
Holmok relaxed, stretching out in
his absent secretary’s chair.

“If the lights don’t come on in 15 .

minutes can we go home?” asked a
female staff member. ~\

“Out! Outl” he shouts, pointing
his ﬁnger at her. His hand is
deformed, waxen in appearance
with only four ﬁngersjbut he uses
it with authority and without
hindrance..The lady scurries out of
the room and Holmok grins as he
watches her exit.

“Another problem I face all the

time is what I callithe empty-nest’

syndrome! It’s a female in her
forties who majored in English
Literature or Fine Arts twenty
years ago and wants‘ to go back to

work. She’s bored with being a '
housewife, and ‘decides she’d like"

an administrative job, but she can’t

work normal oﬁce hours because‘

little Johnny is still in school and
she has to be home by 3:00 to greet
him.” Holmok grins again, amused
by his own description. “About one
woman in 10,000 finds her
administrative job, and it’s usually
in a hospital, but she’s happy.”
The lights suddenly come back on,
and Holmok’s assistant David

Francis, brings him a cup of coffee.
“Glad the lights held up for most
of it,” said Francis as he handed
the coffee over.
“Gee, aren’t you nice,”

said"

Holmok, ignoring the comment K,-r‘

about the lights.

“Somebody otta’ marry me,” said
the ﬁftyish Mr. Francis.

‘ ‘For a cup of coffee that's a pretty
big price,” laughed Holmok.

Like his assistant, Holmok is a
bachelor. He possesses an instinc-
tive insight about people and
students when evaluating their
employment possibilities. —

Dr. Anita Mallinger, creative
writing teacher at Pitt, is amazed at
his insight into people.

“I had been teaching high school
for a year,” comments Dr.
Mallinger, “and needed some
direction in shaping my future
plans. I went to Holmok, and
after brieﬂy looking through my
records and experience and talking
to me for iust a little while he said,
‘What are you doing here, you

belong in a college classroom‘

teaching.’ Here I am today, and I
love every minute of it. I'm amazed
how that man knows people.”

But knowing people takes time,
and Ernest»Holmok’s job requires
lots of it. During the recruiting
season, October to April, he often
arrives at his office around 7:30 in
the morning and doesn’t return to
his home in McKees Rocks until 7
or 8 at night.

“But I don’t mind, that’s what I’m
paid for,” said Holmok, “giving
the facts straight to students and
graduates, no matter how long it
takes or how much it hurts.”

The show was over. Actors took
their bows—two cast .members
coming out with their backs to the
audience. A

But there was just a smattering of
applause. ‘Only a few people sat in

’ I~)\avid Rinear told the Pantagleize

castto try it again. It was one of
the last rehearsals and yes, even
the curtain call must be practiced.
The cast of Pantagleize has a lot of
fun. -But there’s also a lot of work
involved in creating a character.
“I didn’t realize the relationship
when I ﬁrstread the play,’ said
Tom Siegal [Pantagleize].
Other people saw pantagleize

' in me and said I should audition for

it.”

Siegal saidthat he identiﬁed with
Pantagleize. “This role’s the
closest I’ve ever had to myself.”

Doesn’t the enormity of the part

figure out why. As long as I know
there’s a lot of work to be done, I
don’tAhave time to be scared.”

!'_,l,__“’*;i;-.l3.‘antagleize is an innocent man

who unknowingly sets off a revolu-
tion with a simply courteous greet-
ing. “He’s not just a clown, he’s a
person,”‘ Siegel said. '

Dick Knowles tossed a razor to .

Jay Silverman. “There’s no
blade,’_’ Silverman said disappoint-
edly. Silverman plays bamboola,
Pantagleize’s servant who is also a
revolutionary.

“It’s nice and physical,” Silver-
fbman said of Pantagleize.

“The
show’s a lot of fun—l like jumping
over walls.

“In” many ways Bamboola’s the
most challenging role I’ve had at
the University,” he said.
though I’m not physically big, I get
to play him big.” _

Silverman likes the play as well as
the production. “I was an under-
graduate during the whole ’60’s
‘revolution’ era. I’ve seen the way
it falls together and falls apart.”

“It’s time the University takes
some biting swipes. I don’t care if
,it upsets people, if they come out

   thinking they got something from

it. .
At first, Buffalo Bromberg had
difficulty appreciating his “char-
acter, Blank, the poet and revolu-
tionary. “You kindiof have to like
your character,” Bromberg said.

“You work on physical things first
until you get around to liking him
and enjoying him. Blank has a
good heart. ' He can’t get it
together very much but he's very
sensitive.”

“The idea of serving is one of the

For Pantagleize, Koch had-to set
his personal cynicism aside. “We
have to let the qualities_ of the

' characters come out—they do be-

lieve in the revolution.”

Like Bromberg, Vito Zingarelli
had difficulty getting into his
character.

“I couldn’t identify with him at

character. I just really got into the
role in the past week and a half. I

BY HARRIS LEVY

Where do you ﬁnd a crooked

light?” The technical crew knows.
For Pantgleize, students work on
the costumes and the sets. [They
build the props and run the lights
and sound.'But since they’re not on
stage, many theatregoers. aren’t

' aware of their existence.
For Pitt’s technical theatre stu- .

dents, working on Pantagleize and
other shows provides them a
chance to apply what they learn.
And not just building, safety and
running the shows. “A technical
student learns how ‘to coordin-

-ate...how to get along with the

actors, stage managers and direc-
tors,” said technical student Cher-
yl Pachasa. “We get a chance to
see how everything is run..how a
show develops..'.and the audience
reactions.” -

This year, a new system where

students were made crew heads
was inaugurated, Pachasa-added,
“The technical faculty spread

themselves over so many areas,

they gave responsibilitiesto certain :

students. When there’s a sense of
responsibilitiy, you really learn:
you have to teach other people on

Technical students stay behind
the scenes. “Most people don’t
realize what goes into a show,”
said tech student Debby Neely.

Seventy-five percent of the Panta-
gleize props were built by the
technical crew. Even if they’re on
for a minute, they must be good
enough to use for a whole per-
formance, the students explained.

Even the props that .aren’t made
by the crew present problems.

‘ ' What Joseph Campbell has done

is to take almost all of the
well-known epic poems and myths,
including some of our nursery fairy
tales, and weave (sorry, there,is no
other word) them into an explana-

tion of how heroes came to be, why ‘

myths exist. and what kind of
primitive psychology. has managed

‘to produce hero and myth. The

word ‘primitive’ is misleading,

actually.

Campbell. suggests that the
myth-producing civilizations
actually had a valuable tension-
releasing mechanism which
modern society lacks. Further‘, he
claims that we— are_ probably not
capable of producing. myths,
because our level, of technology is
too advanced.

In order for modern civilization to

replace these ‘lost’ myths, Camp-_
bell says, “A transmutation of the
whole social order is necessary...
but...as the new symbols become

literature; But, if you didn’t read it’

visible, they will not be identical in
the various parts of the globe: the

. circumstances of local life, race,

and ‘tradition must all be com-
pounded in the effective forms.”
Campbell is not a difficult author
to understand. In fact, his
technique is so smooth that a word
of caution may be in order; make
sure you’ve got’. plenty of time
available when you begin to read. I
started about 9 a.m. one Saturday
morning, with the intention of
reading enough to get me through

a mythology test. At about 7 p.m,,-

I finished the book. You may find,
too, that you’ll want to sitiand stare

too. By the time you’ve finished,

The Hero With a Thousand Faces,
you’ll probably want to read, or
‘reread, many of the hundreds,

perhaps thousands, of myths and -

stories Campbell uses to illustrate
his points. 1 i

and the lamplighter .morei.ithan-

adequately. "Everyone else’s acting
including Shade’s stunk.

Much of this was due to terrible
staging by Irving Guttman which
was boring and at times even
distracted from the action. ' John
Modenos, as Manon’s brother was
the biggest offender as he was
generally early for his singing
entrances, leaving himself stand-
ing center stage with his arms up in
the air with nothing to sing for a
bar.

Also at odds with his part was th '

leading man, Carlos Montane (Des
Grieux), whose troubles stemmed
from being fourinches shorter than
Manon even in heels. His voice
was adequate, at times excellent,

, although he had extreme coordina-
tion problems with the orchestra in
Act I.

Fortunately, the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony‘ Orchestra under the able
direction of Richard Karp was
excellent and the chorus, while
hampered somewhat by staging,
sang very well. The sets were also
dull. The best being Act III’s dock
and the worst, Act IV’s rock on the
plain. '

The evening was saved by the fact
that Shade is impressively hung
which provided this sexist with the
evening’s two highlights. One
being the series of curtain calls at
the end of each act in which Shade
displayed a ﬂare for the old
“sighing” dramatics as well as an

4 excellent profile coming on and

going off" stage; and the second “
being the dramatic death in the ,

‘desert scene of Act IV, where,
while neither vocalist "knocked me
out of my seat, - I was much
entertained by Montane’s efforts to
avoid Shade’s breasts during the
long and ‘erotic death embrace,
which naturally was performed’
with Shade lying across his lap with
her back to him and her face to the
audience.

' Ah, well‘, to each his own.

A Matter of Enjoyment

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

As I am leaving the Pittsburgh area, having miraculously entered the
ranks of the employed, I shallino longer be writing for this newspaper.

..éntion, so. . .

I enjoyed having the opportunity to throw out some ideas, and I hope _
,. ~;°"¥v‘%1t some people proﬁted. There is one idea I never had a chanceto .

Everybody thinks that music of the concert hall is only for the rich, the
super-rich, the well-educated, or the person who has studied music in
detail. Nobody seriously believes that it’s all right to go to a concert to
just listen andenjoy the stuff. We can’t really enjoy concert-hall music
until'we’ve studied it, and know, all that stuff about form, harmony,

counterpoint, and so on, right?

Hell, no! Look at it this way, do you study the music of Led Zeppelin
before you go to their concert or do you just go and listen?- Okay, so
why should concert-hall music be any different? I don’t mean that you
can’t increase your enjoyment by studying music--any music--I just
mean that there’s not anything wrong ‘with just listening to Bach,

Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, etc.

Okay, so you really want to get into_“c'oncert_-hall_er;[p_m,ent. First ti
all, don’t expect miracles overnight. Buy yourself an FM radio and
listen to WQED,‘WLOA, or—KDKA (at night). Get to know some
 people you can stand who like concert-hall music; listen to their
"~Rcords. Read the music reviews in the paper, but remember that often

that guy writing (like me) may not know a hell of a lot more than you
do. If you read and digest the information on the record dust jacket,
you will get just about all the information you’ll -ever need.

Toprogress to the state ﬁnalizing in the art of “music B.S.’er”, all

you need to do is memorize this phrase: “Well, yes, of course, I see
what you’re saying, but really, it’s all a matter of taste...” You can’t
miss. Don’t study music to death. Enjoy it. That’s what it’s all about.

Jim Bolla; quite possibly Digger
Phelps does, too. And if they don’t,

more than anybody else who was
responsible for Pitt’s upset wins

"against Marquette and Notre

Dame.

Pitt trailed Notre Dame by 13 with
just 12 minutes remaining. Enter
Jim Bolla, and ten minutes later
the Irish had a slim two point lead,
largely because Bolla scored six

‘points, grabbed some key re-

bounds, and caused many tum-
overs. ~

_ “Notre«Dame was one of his most
outstanding games,” says Coach
Buzz Ridl of Bolla. “It should be a
great satisfaction to him to have
played so well against one of the
best teams on our schedule.”

« Three weeks earlier Bolla had

49 seconds left in the game, 4527

iecstatic fans screamed, clapped,
and smiled; and shouted ‘-‘Boll-a,
Boll-a, Boll-a.”

But Bolla seemed hesitant to take
too much credit for the win.

“It was a great game to win, but it
wasn’t just me who won the
game,” says the 6’8” senior from
Crafton. Too modest about his
game? Probably. A team player?
He sure is. *

Bolla was the starting center for
the Panthers at the beginning of
the season, but in a few weeks
Melvin Bennett had won the job.

Chuck Mozingo is a soft-spoken
guy. He is a classic example of the
scholar-athlete, more at home with
his books than in competition
sports.

I Here the similarity ends. Mozingo

is a bloodcurdling maniac on the
track surface.

This year the philosopher-poet (he
is widely known on the team for his
witty verse) has run a 1:10.9 in the
600 yard run, qualifying him for
both the Eastern Championships
this weekend in Princeton and also

the transition from starter to
bench. But Bolla, who eats steak
and potatoes--but not lightbulbs,
as was erroneouslv reported in
Sports Illustrated last year, has
adapted to the situation fairly well.

“Jim has accepted a role as part-
time player like few others would,”
says‘ Ridl. “His attitude,” Ridl
continues, “helps others who also
aren’t seeing much playing time.
And he helps other players because
he knows the intricacies of both our
offense and defense.”

Bolla should know the system.
He’s been around for ﬁve years --
one year a medical redshirt -- and
because‘ of his combative, aggres-
sive type of play, has been
wounded often throughout his
career. He’s had two arm opera-
tions while at Pitt, and has been
taped, wrapped, and ﬂu-stricken
perhaps more than any other
player.

“I don’t like to push people,”
Bolla says, “but it’s all part of the
game. Starting in about the ninth
grade I played with the college
kids, and we used to have some
pretty rough games. They taught
me that in order to play, you had to
learn how to handle the physical
part of the game. When I play in a
game, I just make sure the other
guy knows I'm there.”

Many people have criticized Bolla
for his warlike tactics, which
usually includes a jab to the cheek
followed by a series of elbows to
the back, but he’s learned to
contend with it.

“When I come in I get things
going, and I think the guys have
more conﬁdence in themselves
when I’m in there. I see a lot of
screens, and because our offense

“I guess I’ve been running ever
since the sixth grade. We only had
one race but it was a start. In
Junior High I was considered a
sprinter and half miler until my
senior year- when the Thomas
Jefferson coaches tried to make. me
a quarter-miler.”

The 440 is an easier race than the
half according to Chuck but he
doesn’t believe it’s his cup of tea.

“The quarter is a good race to run
but I don’t have the natural speed

isn’t made for the big man, I’m not
worried about scoring. As for the
fans, I’m not worried about what
people say about me, they can say
what they want;_they’re paying for
their seats. Besides, if you listen to
what people say it can really psyche
you out.”

Trying to psyche him out on
Friday will be several thousand
West Virginia fans.

“I- think that we can take the
Eastern Regional if we play‘ ball the
way we’re capable of,” says Bolla,
who has averaged four rebounds
and three points a game this year.
It would be a fitting conclusion if
Bolla could start in the tournament,
but it won’t happen. “I like to
sta ,” says Bolla. “If you didn’t
you wouldn’t be out there.” «

What might happen, however, is
for Ridl to use both Bolla and
Bennett in the lineup at the same
time if the Panthers eventually
encounter a taller team than their
own. It depends on the situation,
but in any case, what Bolla wants to
do more than anything else is‘ win.

“Wehave a chance to prove to a
lot of people what we can do,” he
says. "‘I’ll be there if they need
me.”

work at it much harder than he for
the simple fact I’m not as fast.”

If the 880 is his best and favorite
race why is young Chuck winning
this year in the 600? _ ,

“The 600 has turned out to be my
best race as a senior,” said
,Mozingo, twirling his new grown
’stache. I,still think of myself as a
half-miler runner but I’m glad to
have qualified at all.”

Mozingo was recruited by three
schools and like so many of Pitt’s
outstanding track people went to
Pitt for three main reasons.

“When I looked at Pitt I was
impressed by their great facilities
and coaching staff plus the fact that
if I went here my parents could
follow my progress.”

Progress is the word that comes to
mind when talking about Mozingo.
He is known to his coach as a weak
starter who every year starts slow
but gets better throughout the
season.

“Chuck is a very competitive and
very consistent runner,” said
Coach Jim Banner. “He seemsto

-get better year after year. As a;

sophomore he was third in the East
outdoors in the 440. Last year he
was injured and again this year he
is making a strong showing.”

What is in the future for frustra-

ted half-miler turned 600 yard
runner? Being an English Liter-
ature major holds little promise for
the sandy-haired runner but he
does have the big dream.

“If I had my way I’d like a
coaching job, anywhere at a college
or university. Getting a masters
degree in business would follow.
I’m not leaving out the possibility
of running for a track club some-
where but I will keep active at some
sport.”

And with that the philosopher
returned to pondering the rele-
vance of practice.

ECAC Blunders
  Tourney Invites

BY G. W. STEVENS
Sports Editor

It seems that every time a selection committee is assigned the task of
inviting teams to post-season play, some team which is deserving of a
bid gets left out. Selecting teams on the basis of their overall
performance rather than by their record in a conference is necessarily a
very difficult task and the use of a selection committee, for both
basketball play-off invitations as well as football bowl game invitations,
has never been, and probably never will. be, perfected. ’

~ The only procedure which can approach fairness, where a conference

race isn’t involved, is the establishment of certain guidelines which can
be adhered to as closely as possible. If a committee establishes such
criterion and then sticks by them, they can not be accused of faulty’
judgment. A

The Eastern Collegiate Athletic,_Conference (ECAC) has this year for
the first time established four regional conferences with the top four
teams participating in a Division tourney. The winner of each play-off
will then advance to the first round of the NCAA tournament. This
procedure’ has, to some extent, made the selection ‘procedure for the
NCAA easier, but there are some glaring defects in the system which

‘were made evident just recently.

The selection committee for the ECAC play-offs was able~to establish
four criterion upon which to base their invitations. These were the
team’s overall record, record within the division, record down the
stretch, and strength of schedule. The fourth of these is merely a value
judgment on the part of the committee in conjunction with the other
three criterion, it is a valuable determinant to the selection process.

Unfortunately, the committee failed to stick by their guidelines and
have added greed and favoritism to the motives behind the extension
of bids.

After Duquesne lost to a formidable opponent from Detroit on

‘Sunday, it was announced that they had been awarded a conditional

bid. The Dukes merely had to travel to Cincinnati for their ﬁnal game
and come home a winner to get in the Southern Division action. ‘If they
lost, then West Virginia would be awarded the fourth slot.

This was an utterly ridiculous situation for the Dukes. How could they

be expected to beat a 20-5 team on their home ﬂoor, especially since
their opponents hadn't lost at home in the last 32 encounters. Even a
loss to the powerful Bearcats would not signify any substantial
deﬁciency on the part of the Dukes and I seriously doubt if any team in
the Southern Division could accomplish such a task.

Duquesne should never have been assigned such a feat in the first
place. If the selection committee would have stuck to their original
guidelines, the Dukes would have been awarded the fourth slot
outright. A

A loss to Cincinnati still leaves the Dukes with a better overall record
than West Virginia with one less loss in the same number of games.
Their record in the division is 3-1 compared to 4-2 for the
Mountaineers. The Dukes, with a winning percentage of .725, topped
Pitt, Villanova, and St. Francis and lost to West Virginia. WVU with a
.667 percentage, split with Pitt, lost to George Washington, and beat
the Dukes, St. Francis, and Villanova;

Duquesne’s record down the stretch is easily better than West
Virginia’s simply because nobody played worse basketball than WVU
in their last eleven games. They won just three of these games over
relatively weak opponents while the Dukes were 6-5. WVU has also
lost ﬁve of their last six while Duquesne went 3-3.

 Klobchurclosesﬂureer

BY STEPHANIE HERDER

Pitt will be losing one of its best
basketball players at the end__of this
season—a player who won awards
for Outstanding Performance in
1973 and for Most Valuable Player
last year. No, it’s not Kirk Bruce or
Lew Hill—it’s Mary Ellen Klob-
captain of» the women’s
basketball team. , _

Klobchar accumulated a total of
200 points this year and has been
the high scorer in 7 of the
Pantherette’s 15 games.

She's played basketball at Pitt for
4 years and during that time has
watched the sport grow. She
remembers when the uniforms
weren’t so great and the spectators
nonexistent. And that was just last
year. ’ V

This year, Klobchar’s high school
coaches Jean Condo and Jan
Kasnevich from Montour were
added to the staff. They’ve built
their 20-woman squad mostly of

senior. ' -

‘The Pantherettes have chalked up- .

a 10-5 record against their oppo-
nents which have included Du-

quesne, Allegheny Community -

College, Penn State and Slippery
Rock. The team “buses it” to away
"games and according to Klobchar,
“We’ve had some really good
marathon bu's trips.” I
The Pantherettes practice 2 hours
a day, 6 days a week. “We play a
fast game,” Klobchar said, “as
opposed to a slow", deliberate

offense some teams play. “Guys I

would call it a run-and-gun offense.

defenses, and we concentrate on
defense more that offense.”
Klobchar excels academically as -

day...” _ —

Her voice drifts off but ’she’s

piercing whistle escape through
her teeth. -

  EBA6 Blunders 

4 , (Continued from Page 12).

In the fourth criterion, there is abit of difficulty. The strength of a
team’s schedule is a relative matter but as far as I can tell the two
teams have about equal opponents on their respective lists. Even if it
is assumed that WVU has the edge, the Dukes still top them on three
out of four measures. - ‘ ' _'

It is quite obvious to me just why West Virginia was given such a good

shot atthe fourth slot. (I really don’t know why they just didn’t give
them the bid in the first place). Being the home team, the game will be c
played intheir Coliseum, they will undoubtedly attract more fans thu
giving the ECAC more incornefrom the tournament. ,*
o There is also an element of favoritism involved in this situation[ West
Virginia’s athletic director just happens to be on’ the selection
committee and it is obvious that despite their dreadful "play of theglast
two months, no one was’ going to keep West Virginia out of the
play-offs. ' v ' .

Not only were the Dukes given an unfair shake, but, the- other three‘
teams, Pitt, George Washington, and Georgetown, were as well. West
Virginia has neverlost to Pitt, the top-seeded team, on their Coliseum
floor.’ Since. they would meet the- Cats in the first round, they could
easily take the tournament despite: the fact’ that they in no way deserve
to be in the NCAA play-offs. - ,,

So it is now up to the Cats to set the record straight. A They must beat .
the'Mountaineers and knock them out of contention. Hopefully,’ they
will embarass WVU because ifxthe Mountaineers should happen to win
it will be -a black day for the Southern Division. A P ,

”A masterpiece, a work
that grows in stature with
repeated viewings.”

”lean Renair’s greatest

work . . . a masterpiece.”
THE LONDON OBSERVER

”A mas
\

champion, Levittown’s Bill Watts
and Canonsburg’s Ed McCarthy, a
national age-group diving champ-
ion. A

At the February 22 home meet
against Youngstown, Jeff Miller
broke both the school and pool
record with a score of 300 in the
one-meter competition that enabl-
ed him to qualify for the nationals.
Miller said, “That weekl had a lot

of extra practice and at the meet I _

guess ljust had a good day.”

In Pitt’s recent win over West S
Virginia, Reeder qualiﬁed for the ’

NCAA championships in both the
one-meter and three-meter diving
competition with scores of 291.45
and 302.25 respectively.
surprised that I did so well,” says
Reeder. “At practice that week I
was in a bit of a slump.

“David is acutely aware of his
mistakes and tries to correct them,
says coach Coffey. “He is pro-
gressing at a better rate than most
divers. He’s a highly motivated
athlete.” «

Pitt’s other national qualifer Tom
F atyol said; » ‘ ‘Being in the nationals
will be a whole newiexperience for
me since this is the ﬁrst time for
me. I don’t know what to expect.’
In the meantime, *I’ll be doing a lot
of diving to improve for the
nationals.”

Such performers have helped
increase attendance at Panther

“I was .

home meets by nearly 25 per cent q

according to Coffey. But it takes
work.

“We begin our program in Sept-
ember,” Coffey says. “At this
time the.tearn does running, calis-
thenics, weight lifting and trampo-
line exercises for conditioning. It

isn’t until early November that "we ‘

actually get into the water.”

Bill Watts conﬁrms. “Presently
my personal training consists of
trampoline work, weight lifting and
practicing dives six days a week,
two to three hours each day.” '

Reeder, who is a pre-med student,
concedes that the time required for
training “just doesn’t leave one
with much free time.”

So what does it take to be a "diver
like Reeder and his teammates? .

“Diving requires a combination of
strength and gracefulness,” says
Watts. Like a football player and a
ballet dancer all in one. 7

Reeder adds that “at meets,
points are given by judges on your
appearance on the board, good
posture, your approach walking

down the board, the smoothness of

the dive, your height and entry into
the water.” ‘

That’s a lot to learn .and perfect.
But the teacher is Al Coffey, a
former professional diver who has
appeared on nationally televised
shows and was a Southeastern
Conference Champion in the one

said tech crew member Jim King.
“We very rarely ﬁnish the techni-
cal aspects until opening night,”

‘~/ .:7‘v‘ge\ up,” Kind said. “The lights
’ have to be checked all the time and
the unistruts must be tightened.”
“The technical aspects go on after
the show opens,” according to tech
student Esther Judy. She men-
tioned the breakaway stool used in
Pantagleize that must be repaired
every night. V
The shop itself requires mainten--

j;.__ ance. “We do all the work in

2: here--the work tables, the cabinets,
and the machine maintenance,”
said Neely.

For Pantagleize welding. was a
special challenge. “Nobody [had
done any; professional welders

Jr‘ have an apprenticeship of some-
,_ -ﬂthing like six months,” King said.

loyalty of crew. members during an
emergency. “When something
“K really important has to get done,
‘ people swarm in,” Judy’ added.
" The students and the faculty re-
spect each other. “The faculty's
very good...they’re really under-
standing and they’ll take time to
explain things," said Kind. '

“In what other departments do
students call faculty members by
their first name?" added Neely.
Technical students get experieince
in all aspects of theatre. “If you’ve
got the right attitude, the right
people, and the right designers you
can get anything done,” Neely
concluded. —

Students are also integral to
creating Pantagleizelsg _co_stum_e_s_._ _
According to Marilyn McWilliams,
a member of Pantagleize’s running
crew, “Mikki Thomas and Julie
Quinio work in the shop all the
time;Chris Smith also works a lot.”
First Lynne (Hemingway) does the

_designs, then we make some of

them in muslin to use _like pat-
terns.” . r .
And all the work for shows as big
as Cabaret is done on just three
sewing machines. “Some of the
time, only two of the”rn__v_vgrk,"”
McWilliams added. In addition,
other clothing is pulled for existing
stock and altered by dyeing and

cutting. “We also do a lot of

shopping,” McWilliams added.
Ingenious techniques are used for

individual costumes. ‘
“lt’s imagination more than°any-

thing,” she concluded. During the

‘show,’ a‘ ri”inning‘,« crew}-,-"' as'$i_s'ts'7 * -"S

S ' performers by -'-helping ./them with‘
-their costume changes.— And like —
the sets, costumes require’ frequent *

attention. A ‘ ‘
Other important roles in Printa-

— gleize are filled by students. Jeff

Chapman is the stage manager.
Besides making sure that props are
on stage when they’re needed,
Chapman has to call the cues.
Stage managing is a demanding job
that requires a lot of time and
carries many responsibilities dur-
ing rehearsals and performances.
“The technical aspects are really
important,” Chapman said. “Light
and sound enhance the acting. And
individual actors have special lights
at particular-moments.” '
Polly Bolton is the assistant
director. “I assist the director in
any way I can--like taking notes,
coaching ‘individual actors, and
working on diction.”

Bolton can run rehearsals when»

director David Rinear is tempor-
arily unavailable. ‘ —. A
“And when the show starts, I

assist the stage manager,” she
said. - "
