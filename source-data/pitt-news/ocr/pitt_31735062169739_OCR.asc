 §Cott  Baum Elected
New SG President

Scott Baum, ISA presidential candidate, proved victorious over STP’s Steve O’Neill by
winning 1,250 votes to O’Neill’s 948.- Geoffrey Bauman, the Students for a Democratic Society
candidate, obtained 186 votes and Marc Simon, representing the FARCE party received ap-
proximately 70 write-in votes in Wednesday’s Student Government election.

Baum clinched 1,010 votes in the College of Arts and Sciences while O’Neill received
only 633. In the School of Engineering, however, O’Neill led with 237 votes to Baum’s 119.

The School of Nursing have 61 votes to Baum and 30 to O’Neill. The School of Education also fav-

ored Baum over O’Neill, 28-14. O’Neill won the School of Pharmacy by receiving 13 votes to Baum’s seven.

«Approximately 2,500 votes were cast in this year’s Student Government election, almost the same

number as last year’s election registered, and representing 35 per cent_of the undergraduate enrollment.

President-elect Baum stated that his “faith in the student body is
renewed,” and expressed hope that he will be able to disprove the
consensus that he -is “an alternative choice rather than a positive pros-
pect.” Baum promised to "do only my best, and I’ll do that well.”

Jeff Barr, newly elected SG vice—president, feels he will be able
to handle his post and looks forward to “doing as‘ good a job as 1 pos-
sibly can.” ,

Both O’Neill and Bauman were unable tobe reached for com-
ment on the election.

Baum is a sophomore psychology major and has been a member
of -the Student Union Board, Commuter Association, YWCA dialogue
teams, and the Sex and Sexuality Committee. He has also served as
chairman of the Legal Awareness Committee. Barr is a math major and
a member of Druids, Delta Sigma Phi frateénity, and the football
team.

  Posvar Consults Students

, January’s issue of the Faculty
News reveals that Chancellor
Wesley Posvar consulted with
both faculty and -students before
signing the statement which end-
ed last week’s Black Action So-
ciety sit-in. '

According to the Faculty News
article, the Chancellor met with
University Senate officers, .fac—
ulty and staff advisers about an
hour after the sit—in.began.’

The" faculty present‘ consisted
of Jerome Rosenberg, ‘vice—presi-
dent of the,University Senate;
Jack Matthews, secretary of the

University Senate; Alan Ross An-
derson, chairman of the Educa-
tional Policies Committee; Rich-
ard Cottam of the Political Sci-
ence Department, and Francis E.
Holahan of the School of Law.

“A series of discussions was be-
gun with representatives of the
Black Action Society around mid-
night,” the article reports, “and
agreement was reached on the
seven points by-3 a.m. whe‘n'Dr.
Posvar signed the statement and

 

the students left the machine  

room in an orderly fashion.”

The statement‘ promised pro— 
gress on the Black Action Socie- g -

ty’s demand of last May 20.

Wednesday’s sit-in capped a':._ 

day-long series of. incidents by

the Black Action Society in ‘com?

Facts On ‘Alternatives’,

.‘ )_(.

Aired By Montgomery;

, In responseto pressu-res from students and administrators, Edison? ,-;
Montgomery, vice chancellor of finance, has submitted a statement), .;
concerning the debate over the publication of the fourth issue of Al-'--‘S’

ternatives to the Faculty and SG Senates. «

The reason for this action is a resolution passed by the SG Senate __ 7*
on Jan. 8 whichcharges that Central Printing acted in an “arbitraryH‘j_l».
and unwarranted manner in refusing to publish” ‘the issue. The. res”o'-"7
lution also charges Central Printing and the Chancellor with violations 3}”
4 of freedom of speech and due process.  

In his statement, Montgomery explained that Allen Disler, ai'co‘- 
editor of Alternatives, was told that as long as certain four letter 

words were in’ the issue, Mr. Beers, head of Central Printing, could

not print it because he found it “morally wrong and personally degrad-‘J. 

 

.7-

ing to print the vulgarities.” Montgomery went on to say that “I 

would not consider directing any employee to perform an act which 
he believed to be morally wrong. I further questioned the contention ,;
that any curtailment of freedom of speech was involved” since remov-'4A.,s,:E'

al of the words did not affect the expression of ideas.
The following courses of action were suggested to Disler:  ¢
——Remove the vulgar words and the article would be printed at once.

——Find a printer outside the University and the Office of Finance  

would pay the bill.

——“Substitute for the article in question a new article describing the  
incident and launching an attack on_Mr. Beers and on me, if that 

was his inclination.”

Disler then proceeded to ask Beers to help find a printer "and Beers:.,:—-iii:
agreed but urged Disler to look for one himself also. After interview- 
mg six other printers, Beers finally found one who would do the job. f__:—:.~
On Jan. 13 and 14, the editors of Alternatives were notified that the; 
printers would place an order if desired. One editor then gave Beers .- 
another copy to be printed in which the vulgarities were removed. . .f;.
Before Beers could take action, another editor called and ordered a ' 
suspension of the printing. This is where the fourth issue of Alterna-"  "

tives stands as of today.

Montgomery objects to the SG resolution because “the incident 

might have caused a degree of inconvenience, but to describe it as

arbitrary, unwarranted, and as an attempt to stifle freedom of speech‘ 6
is pompous nonsense. Since the Chancellor approved the search for 
an outside printer, he cannot be guilty of violating guarantees of due -, 
process. I might note that had I ordered Mr. Beers to print the copy ', 

or face dismissal, such an issue would have been created.”
Montgomery closed his statement as follows: “I must state that

lication is merelya sign of impish immaturity, havingfno value as an

* Editorial

 

The SG election campaign is now
dismal memory. The campaign is over
and politicking will cease for another
year. But Scott Baum has inherited a
’ tremendous headache—the'pains of re-
 wsponsibility andrfrustration will prob-
 " ably follow him for the next year.

  

 

F Baum will soon face a SG Senate‘

which will seat 13 senators from
g, _ Baum’s ISA party, and 12 from the op-
‘  posing STP party. This split could
i make the Senate» more obsolete than it
is in its present state. What role will
{the SG Senate play in the Baum ad-
’ ministration?

 
  

The SG president-elect also will
face the tremendous responsibilities of
making cabinet appointments. A new
chairman of the Academic Cabinet
will have to selected. And who will
; be the new representatives sitting on

  
   
 

v (these people maintain the vital’ link
 between the faculty and the student
j body?

  

 

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is unprecedented for me, as director

of student publications to reprimand a
member of The Pitt News staffpublicly.
But I~feel that David Rosenblum’s article

_ “Dr. Posvar’s Alternative” is more than
A  _ ample justification for setting a precedent.

Mr. Rosenblum not only has not print-
ed the facts, but also has refused to consi-
_ der them. (For the fortunate reader who
 have missed Mr. Rosenblum’s article
and the flap thatpreceded it, the issue re-
‘volves around allegedly objectionable
words which appear in the still unprinted
fourth issue of Alternatives, a temporarily
recognized student publication. Mr. Clar-
ence G. Beers, supervisor of the Universi-
ty’s Central Printing, refused to print the
' issue in his shop. For not forcing Mr.
Beers to set aside the dictates of his own
conscience, Chancellor’ Posvar has been
accused of censorship.)

I- accuse Mr. Rosenblum of censorship
by omission. He failed to mention that the
University offered to pay for an outside
printer to do the job. I informed Alterna-
tives of this alternative, as did Mr. Edison
Montgomery. Having a university publi-
cation printed off campus is a usual pro-

'cedure; Central Printing sub-contracts
numbers of jobs; Three pages of printers
appear in the Yellow Pages of the Tele-
phone Directory. In point of fact, it was
Mr. Beers who secured a printer after
contacting six who refused to print Alter-
natives for the same reasons that Mr.
Beers refused.

Let us now discuss the basic principles
involved here. Did Mr. Beers, in express-
ing his own moral position in this very
specific instance, act in opposition to the
stated university policy of no censorship?
I submit that Mr. Beers did not obstruct
university policy of freedom of expres-
sion.

Mr. Rosenblum sees Mr. Beers as ‘a

 

 the Faculty Senate committees. Will .

 

Whew, It’s Over

Beyond this, Student Government
is archaic in its present structure. Will
Baum attempt to abolish the SG Sen-
ate? Will he create, more committee
styled cabinets? Will he re-structure

. Student Government making it a more

dynamic force in the University com-
munity?

Scott Baum, in our view, has a
greater responsibility than his prede-
cessors. Most students are fed up with
the present Student Government. And
a great percentage of students didn’t
even. care to vote in this election. If
Baum can’t produce meaningful Stu-
dent Government reforms that produce
constructive results, the city can col-
lect the remnants of SG and throw it
into the Allegheny River.

The SG president-elect has a
chance to make Student Government
more relevant to the students. And this
will not be an easy job. Scott Baum
has won this election. We hope he can
win our respect.

censor because he refused to print the al-
leged vulgarities. I see him as a man with
a conscience who refused to print material
which violated his sense of morality and
ethics. 1 would call it censorship if there
were no other printing plant in the city.
I would call it censorship if the university
refused to pay the cost of having Alterna-
tives printed off-campus. Both of these ar-
guments are negated by these facts: Mr.
Beers found another printer and the Uni-
versity is paying the printing cost.

Why does Mr. Rosenblum, in his

_trumpeting for freedom, overlook the prin-
ciple that Mr. Beers also has rights and

privileges as an individual? Does Mr. Ros-
enblum think that we are all equal in our-
demands for freedom of expression, or are
some of us more equal than others? Does
Mr. Rosenblum have a right to dissent, but
not Mr. Beers?

Let me close by quoting from a 1951
Harry Truman letter to the American Bar
Association:

“Although the nation has always unit-
ed_against any external peril, blind obedi-
ence to authority has never been charact-
eristic of Americans. Rather. they have
been questioners, doubters. experimenters,
and very often articulate and vociferous
dissenters. This attitude is perhaps our
unique and most valuable national asset.
It has promoted our moral and spiritual
welfare. It has forced discussion, exam-
ination. and re-examination of policies on
every level.

“The free interchange of opinion and
criticism thus made possible is in a very
real sense the most important element of
national security we possess, for it pro-
vides a greater likelihood that we will take
the right course than does any system in
which policies are determined by a few
leaders whom none dares criticize.”

Continue to dissent, Mr. Rosenblum,
but get the facts. '

Remember The Winners

 

 

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Well, the SG election is over. The win-
ners, the ones who have made it to the seat
at the front of the room are celebrating.
They think they finally have gotten what
they want.

Remember them yesterday. They were
the ones who stood on the steps of Schen-
ley Hall and waved '
pieces of paper in front
of the faces of everyone
who went in and out of
the building.

THEY WERE th e

asked, “Did you vote
yet?" And if a person
said no, the candidates
would introduce him- H W
self, saying, "vote for me."GAE0f{(;,E LIES

This conversation will prove to be the
last between the voter and the candidate.
For after the election, the voter’s name is
never remembered, and the name of the
winning candidate lives on in oblivion.
The two never meet again, that is. until
the next election. ' I

Then remember them tomorrow. Re-

member them after the joy of their vic- ’

tory wears off. Ask them then to quote
from their pre-election party platform. Ask
them then of their plans to improve the

   

 Today’s Quote

school and to get students involved. Ask
them then if they will give fiv_e minutes
of their time to listen to you.

Yes, the election is over, and the win-
ners now deserve their fate. They worked
harder toward their goal; they planned bet-
ter than the losers. That’s why they’re win-
ners.

' Each one is optimistic about the fu-

ture; snubbing the cliche which goes, “it
looks good on my record.” Yes, they’ve

‘made it.

THEY’VE MADE‘ IT to the top, to
the head of the class. But now they’re in
the same position as the guy. at the head
of a funeral procession; the guy in the
coffin.

What happens when their young ideal-
istic ambitions wear off? What happens
when they begin to think it wasn’t worth
it? Ah, the rub. '

To reach a goal is the worst thing; cer-
tainly, it builds confidence because a chal-
lenge is overcome. But too many people
begin to take their new role for granted;
the affection for a one-night stand soon be-
comes nil. The responsibility of an office
soon becomes a burden.

WHEN THIS OCCURS, the winners
will look, shake their heads, and say, "I
really wanted to do it at the time. I got
involved. I felt important. It was fun. But
why . . .?”

Dr. James F. Knapp, English professor, to the stu-

dents, in his Poetry class:

“If you don't know how to react, there can be no

response.”

BAS ‘Self-Interest’

Editor, The Pitt News:

Black Action Society, an ignobly self-
interested group feels that they should be
given preferential treatment over the
whites, Indians, and foreign students of
this and I suppose every other university
in the U.S.A. I logically find their think-
ing diametrically opposed to the funda-
mental conceptsof democracy.

As examples of‘ rights they wish to as-
sume I cite:
(1) The right of apartheid in Hillman

' Library;

(2) The right to threaten University of-
ficials; '

(3) The right to lay seige to Universi-
ty property; ‘

(4) Special rights to monetary re-
courses;

(5) The right to burn the Cathedral of
Learning down;

(6) The right to disturb the efficient
operation of the school’r routine, and

(7) The right to commit nuisance and
violence. '

Wake up America and notice that your‘
mettel is beingtested. Perhaps the Negro
doth protest too much and work for the
rights of all men too little. I hope the
Chancellor has the courage not to be bow-
ed by "angry rhetoric” or assault if it
comes to that but will stand firm on dem-
ocratic principals and "Constitutional law.

Finally, I am grateful to the partici-
pants that they did maintain relative order
and that thereby major difficulties were
averted.

It may sound paternalistic to you but
let‘s get on ‘with the business at hand,
namely getting an education.

Daniel McNary' .

  

Support BAS Action

Editor, The Pitt News:

As students and alumni of Pitt, we are
writing this letter to state our unequivocal
support for the sit-in staged by the Black
Action Society on Wednesday of this past

week and for the demands presented by

them to Chancellor Posvar.

The administration, has set about ful-
filling its May agreement to come to grips
with the critical situation of black students
at Pitt at a very leisurely pace.

This is the major reason for the frus-
tration and anger that led to the BAS sit-
in.. Why does the Pitt administration have
to be forced to live up to its agreements?
Who can take seriously any of its state-
ments about humanism and human rights?

And where have those students been
whose “sympathies” lie with the cause of
black equality and of justice for all hu-
man beings? Where have they been while
the University has been dragging its feet.
And what are they doing now that this in-
activity has been brought to light?

All students are invited to face our
problems. Join with the Committee
Against White Racism in this struggle for
self-knowledge and for social justice. Our
next meeting is on Wednesday, Jan. 22, in
Room 425, SU.

N Gymnasts Win

 

Hang On To Slim Lead

by MIKE WALDHOLZ

“We did it, coach,” exclaimed captain Dave Andrew, his
arm around Warren Neiger. “We won it, we really won it!”
Thus went one of the reactions of the gymnasts last night after their
squeaker victory over West Virginia by the score of 112.3-111.7. They
go after win number two tomorrow night while playing host to Massa-

chuetts.

"The boys knew we would have
to go out there and do well in the
floor exercise, side horse, and still
rings and we did. They had to
hang on in the last three events
of long horse vault, parallel bars

~ and horizontal bars and they did.

The boys‘ reacted to pressure with
fine style and that’s the reason for
our first victory," explained Nei-
ger. ’

Besides winning their first meet,
the gymnasts accomplished many
other firsts of the gymnastics sea-
son. While scoring its highest
point total, the gymnasts racked
up a first, second and third place
from Phil Lilly, a first and sec-
ond place from Andrew, and a
first place from Lowell Meek.

The first event, floor exercise,
was won handily by the gymnasts,
28.8-17.0. This lead proved to be
the winning factor as the gynnasts

"We'll find out if were any

coach. “Orange County has had
six matches so far this season and
they’ve won them all."

Orange County is considered to
be one of the better junior college
mat powers in the East. Last-year
they were ranked eighth in the
nation in the junior college divi-

sion and several returnees from '

that squad form the nucleus of
this year’s team.

Returning at heavyweight is a
boy who took second in the re-

placed fourth in the nationals at

Among the newcomers are two
highly touted lightweights. At

Westminster then took over and
controlled the ball until. with
0:06 remaining. center Jerry
Causer fouled Gary Brown.
Brown sunk one of two. free
throws and the cagers record
dropped another notch to 2-11.

“If Patch would have only
made that lay-up," said coach
Buzz Ridl. "I don't even think
they ‘would have called the of-
fensive foul on him if he made
it." -

But the cagers would not have
been in such a close game if it
was not for Westminster forward
“ Russ Boston.

"He‘s quick,” explained Ridl
after watching him run circles
around Rob McFarland and Mike
Riggle. "Petrini did a pretty nice
job on him for awhile, but he’s
just too quick. He's too quick for
most players.”

Boston finished the game with
18 points despite sitting out the
last six minutes of the first half.
The 6-3 jumping-jack got into foul
trouble early in the game.

"He had three fouls in the first
half, and we were scared to lose
him,” said Westminster’s assistant
coach Fran Webster. “We were
lucky to have Russ the whole sec-

ond half."

With 1:24 seconds lef't, Boston
stole a Mike Patcher pass and"
drove the length of the court to
knot the score at 64. Boston also
scored the four previous points on
two free throws and a jumb shot.

Tanlcmen Face Penn State;
Seek Second Swim Victory

by MARTIN HELLMAN

Saturday’s swimming meet against the Nittany Lions of
Penn State University is an important one for the Pitt tank-
men. The meet will begin at the Trees Hall Pool at 2 p.m.

The mermen have won only one contest so far this year. that i

being the first meet against Indiana State University. They have lost
three meets. to Temple. Bucknell and West Virginia.

The squad hopes to repeat last year's victory over the Lions.
The score of that meet'was 71-42. Last season marked the first time
that Penn State had a swimming team.

Coach Bill Grant is quite optimistic about the meet. “The boys
have been steadily improving and I think that we have a good
chance to win.”

For the first time this season, the freshmen will also get a
chance to compete f'or points. Prior to this meet, the frosh swam
exhibition races along side the varsity. '

The freshmen will compete against the Nittany frosh. This will
be the first duel varsity-freshmen meet of the year.

Coach Jerry Snyder is looking forward to this meet. “This will

give us the opportunity to see how the frosh react under meet con-
ditions,” he commented.

 rage 8—'l‘HE PITT NEWS—Thursday, January 23, 1969

Dear Mr. Doan :

I question whether a business
career will allow me to attain ,
what I would consider a proper
balance among all aspects of my
life. Is business today so
demanding that one would have
time for little else? A job is a
major part of life but not the
whole of it. Raising a family is a
very important part of most
people's future plans. Therefore,
of prime concern would be the
possible adverse effects a career
in business might have on an
individual's family obligations.

Are basic family ties weakened
as a result of a preoccupation .
with business? With respect to
family ties, Dr. Feinberg in the
January 1968 Dun's Review says,
''In the family of the typical

‘business executive there is very

little knitting together of
diverse environments." It would
appear that an executive cannot
adequately fulfill his role as a
husband and father. The family
unit is subordinated to his job.
A preoccupation with business
can mean more than just a lack
of time to spend with one’s
family. In the same article, Dr.

Feinberg says, "Many youngsters »

feel that their fathers know the
price of everything and the value
of nothing." There appears to be
the tendency to emphasize the
economic side of life and to
ignore the equally important
personal side.

My question is whether being a
good husband and father will
necessarily conflict with being a
good businessman. Draw on
your own personal experience,
Mr. Doan. Can you honestly say
that en route to becoming a
successful businessman, you
were an equally successful
husband and father? Need these
roles be contradictory? If not,
how did you resolve the conflict?

Sincerely,

David M. Butler

‘ Electrical Engineering,

Michigan State

Mr. Doan.’

David M. Butler, Michigan State

-.- .-‘/ozvw ac‘

Dear Mr. Butler:

You ask about conflict between
the time demands of a job in
industry and the time we need
for our family life.

Well, first of all, I'm not sure
there's any real difference
between this problem as it occurs
in business and as it occurs in
any other occupation; the same
problem occurs in education, in
government, or in the ministry.

In any field—and this is the basic
problem—the more responsibility’
you assume the less time you'll
have for your family.

In many cases this factor has a
built—in balance: the heaviest
responsibility usually comes to
us at an age when our children
have grown up, so that in an
idealized sense there may be no
problem at all.

. My own view is that you can

have both a satisfying career and
a good family life, but I

recognize that for the young
business executive this is a very
real problem, and one that
requires some choices to be made
—consciously or unconsciously.

You are perfectly right thatyou
cannot carry _a very large
business or educational or
governmental responsibility and
also have an ideal family life-
particularly from the standpoint
of time. Perhaps the saving
grace of this dilemma is that
each of us can make our choice
as to what we- want. ‘

  

When Dr. Feinberg says that
many parents "know the price of
everything and the value of
nothing" he is right, but I'm

sure this phenomenon is not
exclusive to businessmen. It is
more a condemnation of
individuals than it is of the
business system. There are great
numbers of businessmen who
have excellent value systems, and
in many cases these are based on
a self-acquired liberal_education.
The man who knows the value of
all things (and the price of
nothing) is invariably of more
value to the business system, just
as he is a more valuable man to
education or to the government.

On the personal side, to some
extent I am a victim of the r
problem you pose. Having raised
a family in an imperfect and, I
suppose, shorthanded (in the
sense of lack of time) way, I can
readily agree that there are
conflicts. But, having raised a
family, I'm convinced as well that
no'one has an idea how this

really should be done. It may well.

be that more time would not
have solved problems that were
personal short-comings in

the first place.

In any event, the central point’ is
that we are free people with

free wills. If you want to work a
40-hour or a 30-hour week so
that you can spend more time
with your family, that is a noble
goal and one you can probably
achieve——if your goal is not to
assume a large amount of
responsibility in your chosen field.

Your question is not related
solely to business, but to any
occupation; and if you are wise
enough you can figure out your
own best balance in this matter.
But I think it should be perfectly
apparent to you that not many
people are this wise, and that
this balance—like many of the
elements of Utopia—is not
really attainable.

To summarize: _if you want to
achieve the maximum success in
any field you had better be
prepared to work long, hard,
dedicated hours. This kind of
advice admits a heavy imbalance
in the way you spend your time,
as I am quite aware, but the
choice is yours.

Sincerely, _
