Nader touts Pirg,

by VICKI TUTIN
Ralph Nader, crusader for con-

"£ sumer rights, urged students here

to support a Pennsylvania chapter
of the Public Interest Research
Group. '

Nader told an audience at Car-

negie Music Hall Wednesday that ,

“students should begin to pool
their modest resources to provide
an outlet for their enormous en-
ergies as yet unorganized, before

-—»,,\ they’ve dissipated.”

Though finding it admirable that
students have played such a large
role in the issues of Vietnam, civ-
il rights and ecology, Nader said

“ students would be more effective

if they are able to harness their
resources and organize. attending
not only to the symptoms of so-
cietal discord, but also focusing
on the instruments of the mala-

 dies of society.
“Words have very little signi-H

ficance unless translated,” stat-
ed Nader. Through the organiza-
tion of the Public Interest Re-
search Group (PIRG), Nader
stressed that “you (thestudents)
will create something to repre-
sent you and afford you with the’
possibility of representing your-
self.”

Nader reminded students that

the country was founded on the’

rejection of the principle of "tax-
ation without representation.”
Therefore, he stated that any or-
ganized society must realize that
if people are being victimized by
other groups, they must have a

‘a voice in the decision-making.

  pleads for citizenship

To this end, he said, the U.S.
supposedly opera tes on the theory
that the people, through govern-
ment representation, will develop

.minimum standards of pollution

control. . ;

However, Nader statedthat “in
Washington, D. C., there has been
a literal revolution against the
people. Congress has become in-
creasingly impotent and abdica-
tive~,_” he said. ‘

It is not the people who are mak-
ing the decisions concerning pollu-
tion, he declared, "but rather the

-officials of U.S. Steel. General

Motors, and Ford who are dictat-
ing the conditions of the air and
water. that not only they must
breathe and drink."

Thus, in his opinion. Americans
are presently ima situation of vic-
timization with representation."

Further, Nader said that stu-
dents are not realistically edu-
cated concerning the contempor-

ary situation. Nader recognizes.

“an estrangement between ' the
academic scene and empirical
reality. The processes of govern-_

ment are described in a very for-’

mal and antiquated way. Thus the
students are starved of the em-
pirical reality around which edu-
cation should be built.”

Through the organization of’

PIRG. Nader hopes to resolve
these discrepancies. If. and only
if, a majority of students back-up
this proposal, he said. students
will elect a Board.

Monday ” referendum

Constitution vote slated

A new Student Government Constitution will
be considered by the student body in a referendum
Monday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.. to be held in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom and the Towers Lobby.

All full-time undergraduates are eligible to
vote. upon the presentation of an ID card and a term
validation card.

The proposed Constitution. forged by the Con-
stitutional Review Committee in consultation with
Dr. Robert Newman of the Speech Department and
Richard Seeburger of -the Law School. was approv-
ed by the Student Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC), after several modifications. last week. ’

If approved, the Constitution will replace the
four Student Association Commissioners with a
seven person Board. The Board will be chaired by
a president, who is to be elected separately from

. other Board members. -

The proposed Constitution also clarifies the re-
lationship between the Allocations Committee and
the Board. The Constitutional vagueness of the re-
lationship between the Student Association Social
Commission‘ and the Allocations Committee was a
major reason for the drafting of a new Constitution. -

In September of this year. the Allocations Com-
mittee complained about the absence of a clear sys-
tem of checks and balances in the existing Constitu-
tion and refused to submit budgets to the Social

Shapp keeps pledge

Commission until the crisis was resolved.

At a joint meeting, the two groups agreed on
temporary operating procedures and contended that
a constitutional review was necessary. Early in Oc-

tober, SAAC named a Constitutional Review Com- _

mittee which deliberated for over a month before
submitting a final document to SAAC. ‘

Under the proposed Constitution’s procedure. the

Board is vested with ultimate authority and can '

reverse an Allocations Committee decision. If the
Board rejects an allocations budget, the Allocations
Committee reconsiders its request and resubmits a
budget to the Board. If the Board rejects the budget

a second time, it has one week in which to deter-
mine the final form of a budget. Five members of H C

the Board must agree on such a final budget.

‘ A novel feature of the proposed Constitution is
its provision for a Programming Committee under
the jurisdiction of the Board. The committee is to
advise individual programing units in the scheduling
of events and appoint a Calendar Committee from
its membership to develop a calendar for the up-
coming year based on the plans of-the units.

',The new Constitution also provides for a Ju.-1'
diciary, to consist of ‘six undergraduates. The Ju- g
«diciary’s jurisdiction is to include Student Govern-'

ment elections and the impeachment process.

The threat of a strike was eased at a meeting
between members of the Building Trades Council
and management in the Department of Physical
Plant Tuesday evening.

Although Union officials didn’t succeed in hav-
ing 14 white construction workers recently laid off
because of the University‘s fiscal crisis reinstated.
they promised to honor the goals of the Affirmative
Action Program while trying to protect the rights
of their rank and file.

Leland Deck of the Insurance Office said that
labor and management “explored a number of sol-
utions to solve the problem of layoffs and the prob-
lem of a shortage of funds.

In all the Union proposals, the representatives

 clearlvoutlined their intentions “of protecting.-the .

The dispute between the two groups arose when
the University laid off white workers instead of min-
ority workers with less seniority in order to fulfill‘
a pledge with the Affirmative Action Program to
employ a certain percentage of minority workers.

Union ‘members charged the University with re-
verse racism and unfair labor practices. However,
University officials countered that had they laid off
the minority workers and been found in non-com-
pliance with the Affirmative Action Program, the
University would have risked losing $26 million in
federal funds. ' -

{S-The Kansas Reception and
.”Diagnostic Center offers a unique
sympathetic rehabilitation pro-
gram to criminals instead of
-vengeful punishment.

7 Rev. Al Davies explained this
“pr'o'gram "Tuesday night at 7:30
-, ‘as part of the Special Programs
- "Series, “Captives of Society.”
3’ ',' In his home_state of Kansas
the Diagnostic Center is operat-
 -ed to analyze all individuals who
~ ‘have been convicted of crimes
 and are destined to be sent to
- - prisons or reformatories. The—Cen-
_‘Uter holds the prisoner for 60 days
' flbefore institutionalizing him
— "while they analyze the problems
which caused him to commit the
rrcrime. .
At" the end of the 60 day per-
Viod they complete the analyses of
 the prisoner and may recommend
1 that he be paroled. These recom-
mendations are forwarded to the
convicting judge who makes the
final decision
inmate’s sentence.

. Since the Center opened in
._- 1961 j the number of parolees
.  has risen from 10 to 60 per cent.

-' One problem confronted by the
program, said,Davis, is the short-
‘age of treatment centers for the
‘_ ~'pri7soners released from the Cen-
ter. And the prisons in Kansas,
‘ he said, are maintained in a
", -deplorable condition.

3  Davies said that only 17 per-
" ,cent of the prisoners analyzed by

. the Center are dangerous enough
* to be locked up. The others, he
-_ said, should be paroled and treat-
“Wed at centers, despite the inade-
' »quate facilities.

‘According to Davies, several

pcriminals, analyzed in Kansas.

Davies, is anable to hold a job

Davies revealed that the Cen-
ter analyzed one man who actu-
ally _committed crimes in order
to be caught. Davies said that
many are afraid they will com‘-
mit a more serious crime if they
are left on the outside. He said
that the study of such subcon-
scious fears may be the key to a
great deal of prison reform.

Since the program was initiat-
ed, the prison population of Kan-
sas has decreased by one thou-
sand individuals, a 33 percent
decrease. Davies added that
about 95 per cent of the prison-
ers analyzed are alcoholics.

»I{al/lsas Center Offers Asks new treatment approach
tinique rehabilitation

  Warner urges reform

by STEVE ZYCH

A Stewart Warner, Deputy Com-
missioner of State Corrections,
stressed prison reform in a speech
that was part of the special pro-
gram, “Captives of Society.”

“The major thrust on our’ part
is to generate a new treatment
approach,” said Warner. Warn-
er cited the community treat-
ment center, relaxation of mail
censorship, liberalized visiting
policies and increase of items
available for purchase in the pri-
son commissary as examples of
present reforms.

“The community treatment

center, which eases the individ- "

ual back "into society, is a new
approach and we hope the Com:

monweawlth -wilh be a leader in
this field nationally," Warner
said.

At present there are four such
centers in Pennsylvania; they are
small intensive .treatment cen-
ters which house from 15 to 20
in-residents. During the day the
in-residents either work or go to
school and return to the house in
the evening. Gradually, Warner
said, they are allowed to live at
home and check in atthe center
once a week until they eventually

_ prove‘ their reliability and are
‘ completely reintegrated into so-

ciety. ’
The program is much cheaper

understanding of the correction-

~Goldfarb explained that
throughout his travels in the
United States, many wardens,

-“at least the most honest, the

most sincere, feel that only about
10-20 percent of the men in
their institution need to be there.”

This is theonly “American in-
stitutionl know of,” Goldfarb
said, referring to prisons, “where
the administrators don’t believe
in the institution they adminis-
trate. .

“Whether -one’s perspective is
public safety or economics or
basic humanitarianism, there is
no precedent of success. Our pri-

to run than standard imprison-
ment as the individual pays part
of his living _cost while housed at
the center, but more importantly
Warner said, the recidivism rate
for the centers is‘ only 20 per
cent, compared to 85 per cent
for the traditional prison struc-
ture.

Another critical need, said
Warner, is an increase in hiring
of qualified people. A

"We can't run our program
unless we have the trained staff
to meet the problems of the in-
dividuals in these centers,” said
Warner. Warner said he felt
training at present is “highly
fragmented at best;” he called

for more and better trainikng__<_to_‘

remedy this s'ituation'I‘“Hei stress-
ed. that all people in the correc-
tional field need training.

“Guards need training as much,
if not more so, than the counsel-
ors,” he said.

Warner also noted the need for
more pre-sentence investigators.

"At present only 28 per cent of
those sentenced to state prisons
are given any sort of pre-sen-
tence investigation. ‘Thus we
don’t know who we’re taking
into the system,” he said.

American prison,

lities of the street. Almost in a
perverse ratio,‘ the less we do to

' correct a man the better off we

are ith that individual. But the
more the system envelops him,

_ the worse off he becomes.”

The Washington, D.C. attorn-
ey said that funds allocated for
existing prisons would be better
spent on “almost anything else.”

“For the amount of money it
costs us,” he said,‘ “we could
send all the young offenders to
Yale and then never have to'wor-
ry about them again.” _ .'

Examining the role of lawyers

and corrections, Singer said that
lawyers have paid an enormous

. amount of. attention towhat hap-

pens to a man from the time he
is picked up by the police to the
time of his conviction.

Also, he said there is a great
need for more psychiatric and
psychological personnel in our
prison system as well as more
and better educated parole peo-
ple.

Warner voiced his support for
the “good time" bill (House
Bill 680) which would abolish
minimum sentences, thus theor-
etically allowing for parole at
any time during the period of
incarceration. ' ‘ 

’In response to a question from

_an ex-inmate of San Quentin,
~-‘Warner agreed that “the prisons

do anything but rehabilitate, and
one of the main reasons is that
there are presently little or no
alternatives to crime ayailable
for the releasedprisoner, due to
lack of job training opportuni-
ties for inmates. Most prisoners
are poor and lack an education
oraskill.

“It is up to us to provide those
that are reformable with a skill
or an education so they will be 
able to survive successfully in
the outside world and not have to
resort to crime to survive,” War-
ner concluded.

lem. There is no such thing as a. 
law of correction . . . And pri- '
soners have little redress for their

She said that, “Although re-
cently the courts have been tak-
ing a more active role in prison-
ers’ rights— mainly under the 8th
Amendment (prohibiting cruel ,
and unusual , punishment? ,-“this
process is slow and inadequate.”

“What we must develop,” rec-i

ommended Singer, also‘a Wash-'

ture just for the criminal offend-
er, but a public ‘agency that

“We have two correctional sys-'

said, “one for the affluent and M
one for the poor. One is an in-
formal, responsible system that
treats an offender with love and

other — the prison —— is nothing ,, 

more than a public welfare sys—;

conceals‘ witch haven

Local witches, or those accus-
ed . fear no more. A haven
awaits you in the Cathedral of
Learning.

No, -it’s not behind .the Studio
Theatre or in the old Registra-r’s
office, but on the third floor in
the Early American Classroom.

In keeping with the moodof
late Seventeenth Century. New
England, the misplaced Nation-
ality room is equipped with..a se-
cret passage -leading to an up-

Theodore Bowman, University
Architect and one of the design-
ers of the room, explained that
the concealed loft was fashion-
ed after one that exists in the
House of Seven Gables. “One of
the gables above the fireplace
was used as a hiding place for
those accused of witchcraft dur-
ing the Salem witch trials,” Bow-
man said. ‘

George Hubbard Clapp, who
f_inanced the room, liked the idea
so the secret haven was includ-
ed above the seven foot pine ceil-
ing of room 328 CL.

And Bowman’s explanation for
the room’s location two floors
away from the other guest attrac-
tions: “primarily because there
was nowhere on the second floor
to do a room like this.”

The room is dimly lit by four
tin lanterns, and a nine foot,
brick fireplace can be used for.

Wade Lawson has proposed that
be assessed an activities_ fee.

Currently, all activities and services grad stu-

ities fees. A

The activities fee, said Lawson, would serve a
two-fold purpose in providing a financial base for a

graduate student government and
high undergraduate activity fee.

Lawson stated that “a delicateisituation” exists
with an unorganized graduate student body receiv-
ing benefits for which the organized undergraduate

students are taxed.

to c0.ld,-sudden temperature drops

by VIRGINIA COOK

A recent study by a University
cartographer has linked as high
asa 43"percent increase in fatal
heart "attacks to cold weather
and sudden drops in temperature
-here in Allegheny County.

The study by Howard N. Zieg-
ler, “Heart Attack Mortality and
Severe Weather,” concludes that
cold weather and drastically fall-
ing temperatures cause breath-
ing and ‘circulation to'be strained
in people predisposed to heart dis-
ease.

Although it was also found that
heat and humidity cause stress
during the summer, such stress is
not thought to be as high as the
winter rate.

Ziegler studied the correlation
‘between heart attack mortality

- and coldjweather from 1,960 to 1,-

963, inclusive.,During this time
there were 12,080 fatal heart

‘ attacks in Allegheny County, and

3,921 occurred during the winter
monthsfor an average of 9.1
deaths per day. '.

Those figures. fell ‘to 2-787 fatal
attacks during the summer, for
an average of 7.6 deaths per day".

Ziegler’s- graph. shows an in-
verse relationship between tem-
perature and fatal heart attacks,
During the average winter week,
there are 63 fatal attacks in
Allegheny County. But during one
week. of high stress, the ‘study
shows, 91 people suffered fatal at-

tacks, an increase of 43 percent.‘ 

The study also notes thatheart
attacks decreased . 22 percent
during a week of mild winter'_
weather.

On'Jan. 23-24, 1963, the tem-
perature dropped 57 degrees,
from 39 degrees F to —18 degrees
F. During ‘this 48-hour period,
35 fatalities were recorded—an in-
crease of 100 percent over the’

average. »

mittee will coordinate campus entertainment and
will have its ‘own budget to “fill gaps in program-

graming is to reside with individual campus organ-
izations. Thus, campus entertainment should be
more decentralized under the new Constitution than
it was’ this year, when the Social Commission was
allocated $75,000 for entertainment purposes.

An additional advantage of the new Constitu-
tion is the Board system. Instead of four Commis-
sionerships—which evolved into separate baronies
this year—the new Constitution provides for a gen-
uinely communal group, in the form of a Board.

The new Constitution’s provision for a Board
president’ also solves a thorny problem. The con-

Last November, only 773 students participated

ﬁarzky awtical of fake 

"'l§f”PTfﬁE‘ﬁ'dment 2-way

Editor:

“The Constitution guarantees every man and woman the right to free speech and the
right of assembly. Last Saturday, there was a serious attempt to deny pro-abortion women both
of these rights. What really concerns me is that an anti-abortion group felt the need to such
a Mickey Mouse tactic.” ,

Thus deduced was one of the most classic cases of illogic to appear
in this paper in recent time. In Miss Ganley’s article of last Monday,
she describes an unsuccessful attempt to block the meeting of a pro-
abortion-group and makes the statements and conclusion I have quoted.

I agree that the attempt to block the groups’ meeting was a wrong
thing to do. Everyone should have the right to assemble and speak. (It
may. be remembered that last winter, pro-abortionist Marc Hiller was

   

guilty of a similar act when he attempted to stop an anti-abortionist
group from setting up a display and information booth- in the then Com-’

mon Facilities.)

Yet while I agree with Miss Ganley on speech and assembly, I feel
her conclusions are completely unwarranted. Anti—abortion groups are’

opposed to abortion. Someone, described as “the phantom,” attempted

to prevent the meeting. Therefore, it was “an anti-abortion group”.
which attempted to prevent the meeting. This is how her argument
runs.

‘The accusatory finger has been pointed at anti-abortionist groups
in general. Implied is that this was a planned act ‘by opposing groups.
Yet at the same time no specific group is named. The possibility that
the act was done by a single individual with no ties to any group is not
entertained. Nor was i;t~consid’e'red that this could have been the result
of the bureaucracy we must all "live under.

Someone could have thought the meeting was cancelled and posted
notices to that affect.’ This very thing happened to an astronomy gath-
ering which I had this summer at the University’s Allegheny Observa-
tory. There was a mix up and the attendant at the building turned'peo-
ple away as I was in the building with other members of the group. I
completely understand the feeling of frustration and disappointment

. Miss Ganley must have felt.

I felt like shooting the attendant. But these things do happen and
it’s-really not anyone’s fault. It is wrong to accuse‘ an opposing group
of something you cannot prove they did.

If there was malicious intent, it could have been on the part of a
prankster who had no philosophic disagreement with the group but who
got a charge out of needling them.

Or maybe it was just some guy that doesn’t like girls.

An even mor.e interesting /alternative is that it was really a mem-
ber of the pro-abortion group who thought this would be’ a good way to
generate publicity for an otherwise unnoteworthy event.

But a “phantom? anti-abortionist?

I hope I am not being too harsh upon Ellen Ganley because it is
obvious from her article that she is a sensitive and perceptive person,
who is a champion of the cause in which she believes. '

But in addition to faulty logic,.she is guilty of one other serious‘
mistake. In this country people not only have the right to freedom of
assembly and speech, but when an antisocial act is committed, they
are considered innocent until proven guilty.

Skybus might not be worth 

by MIKE O’LOUGHLIN

Rapid t r a n s i t in Allegheny
County and the City of Pittsburgh
has been sorely neglected in the
past few years. Pitt commuters
can testify to the woes of waiting
for late buses in the cold, winter
weather. _

Recently, the transit issue has
been a highly controversial poli-
ticalissue. .

During the 1971 race for Alle-
gheny County’s Board of Com-
missioners, one issue became a
central focus - the proposed Ear-
ly Action Program for rapid tran-
sit. When Republican Commis-
sioner candidate William Hunt
received more votes than either
of the Democratic Commission-
ers, Leonard Staisey and Thomas
Foerster, it was viewed as an in-

dication of public discontent with _

Skybus, since Hunt vigorously
opposed Skybus, while Staisey
and Foerster defended it.

THE EARLY ACTION PROGRAM

The Early Action Program was '

developed by the Port Authority
of Allegheny County (PAT) in
concert with Westinghouse Elec-
'tric Corporation. It is only the
first phase of a planned sixty mile,
county-wide transit system.

The program has three compon-
ents: -

1. Transit Express Revenue
Line (TERL, the South Hills’ Sky-
bus)

2. Patways — South Patway and
East Patway.

3. Rail Improvement Program-
partial rehabilitation of South
Hills’ Trolley lines;

The Program’s estimated cost
is 228,566,000 dollars plus a 10 per
cent inflation allowance. Under
the —Federal—Aid-to-Transit Pro-
gram, the Federal‘Government is
shouldering two thirds of the’
cost with 152,370,666 dollars. ‘The
Pennsylvania State Legislature
and Allegheny County each are
contributing one sixth of the to-
tal (or of the total 38,092,667 dol-
lars) to the program."

TERL, more commonly known
as Skybus, is a rubber-tired, elec-
tric powered vehicle which runs
on an 'elevated concrete road-
way. Fully automatic, it was _de-
signed by its creator, the Westing-
house Electric Corporation, to
run—in single cars or in trains of
up to ten cars, with a car arriving

, at each station every two minutes.

With its downtown stations at
the Midtown Plaza and the Penn
Central Station, the Skybus route
would cover 10.6 miles partially
following the present South Hills’
trolley line through Beechview,
Dormont, Mount Lebanon, and
Castle Shannon. Twelve stopping
stations are included along the
route with the terminal station lo-
cated ,in the South Hills Village
Mall. ‘

The second component of the

Early Action Program, is a- sys-.

tem of highways devoted exclu-
sively to buses running from parts
of the suburbs directly into the

downtown area. The PATway sys- 1

tem includes two exclusive bus
routes, East PATway and South
PATway, each having branch bus-
es circulating in the surrounding
neighborhoods and enteringthe

SUPPORT, ‘DISSENT —
AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL
Besides the PAT Board and the
two majority county commission-
ers, Staisey and Foerster, the Sky-
bus proposal and the entire Early

Action Program appears ‘to have -

great support from City Council.
In a v.ote on November 15, City

Council voted 8 to 1 in favor of I

ordinances granting to PAT the
use of the ‘Wabash Tunnel and
land at both ends of the tunnel.

The chief opponents of the
Early Action Program are County
Commissioner Hunt and Mayor
Peter Flaherty.

Michael Scanlon, Assistant Dir-
ector for Community and Public
Relations for the Early Action Pro-
gram, said that the Early Action
Program is a sound first phase
answer to the commuting prob-
lems of county residents. Further,
he asserted that the program
would provide jobs for approxi-
mately 1,220 people in 1973 at a
total wage cost of 72 million doll-
ars. Scanlon pointed out that the
Skybus project offers an innova-
tive, pollution free, and virtually
noise free vehicle which should
lure more riders to switch from
automobiles to mass transit.

Opponents of the program has-
ically feel that the program’s
cost greatly out-weighs the bene-
fits to the public.

Opponents generally support

an alternative program similar to -

one proposed by the Westing-
house Air Brake Company (WAB-

‘CO). The WABCO plan is based

upon the preservation of the pre-
sent rail routes with improve-
ments and expansion of those
lines constructed in stages with-
out interfering with present traf-
fic. ‘ 6 _
COST COMPARISONS

C.D. Palmer, graduate of Civil
Engineering at Cornell and form-
er president of the Pittsburgh
Railways Company, ‘guessed that
in a period of two years, at an es-
timated cost of 10 million dollars,
the following items could be
accomplished under ‘the, WABCO

1. Reconstruction of 15‘ miles
of roadbed with new welded-
joint rail on new ties and new

7 ballast. -
2. Repair of six miles of road-

bed.

improved parking facilities built.

4. Renewal of eighty carsand '

improved signaling systems.

C.P. Palmer in his booklet Tran-
sit Break-through?, writes, “Un-
supported assertions by_ Westing-
house Electric and PAT board
members that Skybus is cheaper
—to build are not defensible.”

Advocates of the WABCO plan
believe that WABCO could in-
stall a system of “proven steel
wheel technology at much less
cost than the experimental Sky-
bus and exclusive busways as out-

3. New passenger stations and C

 

lined in PAT’s Early Action Pro-
gram.” .

INTERFERENCE WITH ROUTES

The WABCO plan, in its design
to continue present rail systems,’
rehabilitating and expanding on
the routes in-stages, would not
interfere with present daily serv-
ice and established travel pat-
terns. -

Skybus, however, says Mr.
Palmer, will eventually interfere
with the present pattern of the
South Hills _trolley lines.

»Upon its arrival in Pittsburgh,
the Skybus will stop at two stations
— the Midtown Plaza station and
.the Penn Central‘ Station. Only
1600 feet apartlboth of these sta-
tions are situated at uptown loca-
tions, inconvenient for most
downtown users. C. P. Palmer
contends that a walk from the in-
tersection of Fifth Avenue and
Smithfield Street to the Skybus
Midtown Plaza Station located
near the present Plaza Building at
the intersection of Sixth Avenue
and Fifth, takes approximately
seven minutes. The present troll-
eys, numbers 35, 36, and 42/38,
travel further into town and dis-
tribute passengers at frequent
intervals along Smithfield, Wood,
and Grant\Streets, thus, for down-
town workers, claims Mr. Palmer,
Skybus will not save them any

' time.

WABCO advocates feel that
with a renewal of the present sys-
tem, service could be efficiently
-improved at a low capital cost,
yet at the same time maintain ser-
vice which penetrates deep into
the downtown area.

TRANSIT LOCATION EMPHASIS '

Opponents of the Early Action
Program feel that the emphasis
should not be placed upon a
South Hills transit line, which al-
ready has a transit facility. Instead,
the emphasis should be placed

of the East PATway, Joseph Co
setti, City Treasurer, said,‘ “Th”
East PATways have the disad
vantages of making no commut
er stops along the most populou
route from the triangle to" Oak
land. This area creates a lar _
demand for transit. The hospital
and universities utilize a larg
number of employees who-wil
be required to first come to'tow,n.
and then backtrack to Oakland”
This is an improvement for ‘sub
urbanites who do not suppor
transit and a disadvantage fol
low income people who patron
ize it. The PAT records indicate
that each bus line that terminates
in the city breaks even and each
bus line which terminates out to’
the city loses money. A grea
deal of patronage could be 10s
‘by poorer service”, ~ ‘

DUAL-PURPOSE TRIP
Markus said that Lawson and

ta after the accident against his
and Douglas’ advice. Of the de-

cision to continue the trip, Mark— '

us said: ‘fl think it was not in the
best interest of the people in the
accident. There could have been
complications, no matter how
slight the injuries.” ,

“There were some matters of
substance,” he added, “that
should have been dealt with im-
mediately—the accident report,
the_insurance report.”

Lawson saidvthe decision to con-
tinue was reached unanimously
Wednesday morningfafter the
doctors gave the students a clean
bill of health. 0

He said that when the Road Race
team indicated it would help fi-
nance the balance of the trip, the
group decided to go to Atlanta.

According to Lawson, the trip’s
purpose was twofold: to transport
spectators to the road race, and
to enable Lawson to investigate
the programming of eight or nine
predominantly-black colleges in
the Atlanta area.

“There are little or no black
activities on campus,” he said,

' “or black involvement in campus,

organizations period.”

He said he wanted to determine
“how other school's handle the

problem.” , ,

Group launches youth

voter registration drive

A Washington—based organiza-”"'*booths“in‘ high schools, colleges,

tion is conducting a nationwide
campaign to register newly en-
franchised 18-20 year olds.

Since its inception a year and a
half ago, the Youth Citizenship
Fund (YCF) estimates it has
helped register approximately a
quarter of a million new voters
in 18 states’.

Drives are currently in progress
in New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio, In-
diana, Minnesota, North Carolina,

and_Florida. A drive in Pennsyl-

vania, which will include Pitts-
burgh, is scheduled to begin in
about six weeks. ’ »

L Sandy Dement, YCF program
co-ordinator, said that the group
attempts to build “broad-based
community support” for voter
registration in «each area can-
vassed. This, she said, usually'in-
eludes. enlisting the aid of local
civic leaders and volunteers.

. Resident Assistants face identit

F!

by LOIS LEVINSON

Resident Assistants, a perman-
ent fixture in University Hous-
ing, now seem to be undergoing
an identity problem.

The role of the RA is no long-
er one of a policeman or moral
guardian. There are few rules to

be enforced, and the University

no longer sits in moral judgment

of student activities. Most R.A.’s.

interviewed by the Pitt News
said they now find themselves
in the position of a counselor-
confidant — sort of communica-
tions experts.

Trish Walesky said “the main
function of an RA is to help with

personal problems” and that she

really enjoys her job. She stated
that the large amount of research

  College editors report

waning yearbook sales

-by STEVE LUBETSKY

Colleges throughout the country have, in recent years, been
plagued by the decline of the traditional yearbook. Stanford Univer-
sity, for example, has dropped its yearbook.

Yearbooks of Pittsburgh schools are experiencing similar prob-

lems.

At Carnegie-Mellon, Ellen Celli, Assistant Director of Student
Activities, reports that the Thistle has been suspended indefinitely.

“The last two bookswere fegot trips~-for--the editors,” Celli re-
marked, “so we will wait till there is more interest in producing an-

other one.”

John Johnson, staff member of L’espirit Duduc at Duquesne,
commented that “sales have not been too good,” mainly because of
“apathy.” To generate interest, he said, the yearbook is planning an

intensive sales campaign.

Margarette Cavanaugh, editor of the Point Park yearbook, Jour-
ney, admitted that sales have declined, and attributed this to “lack
of organization and student disinterest.”

“When the yearbook is being produced,” she said, “it’s so’ far
removed from the students. It's made up by a certain date, and the
final result is not until the end of the year.” .

In an attempt to sell more issues, Cavanaugh said, Journey is
planning “a good advertising campaign. We will try to make the stu-
dents realize that the yearbook will be better this year.”

Karen Smith, Associate Editor of the yearbook at Pitt, revealed

that the Owl will attempt to increase its sales by

coming to the

students. “We’re planning a big publicity campaign,” she said.

“Last year an index survey was taken on how much students are
willing to pay and what material they consider relevant,” she ex-
plained. “We set a price of five dollars, and the sales have been good

this year.”

Furthermore, “almost every senior whose picture was taken

bought a book this- year,” she added.

One factor responsible for increased sales, said staff member
Chuck Steeber, is the expansion of coverage to additional schools
and organizations, including various graduate schools, and General

Studies.

“We’ve enfranchised the whole University, so sales are going
up,” said Steeber. V
According to Smith, the 1972 Owl will also unveil changes in
content.

done for the program has helped -
make it successful.

An “extended family” is what
makes RA’s important, according
toG.er:ri Woods.

“They are needed as a home-
away-from-home brother or sister
to show the students that they
are needed,” she added.

Carole Coval said that because
of a good RA she had when she
first came to the University, she
decided to become one. She said
that students have become very
independent, so the RA “has to
be flexible and allow a person-
ality exchange to take place.”

Also recognizing the change in
students, Tony Patterson stated
that RA’s are equal to the change
and that they no longer need to
retain “the straight image” to
maintain respect’. He sees him-
self as responsible for adminis-
trative duties and as a friend:

Amy Karpinski admitted that
free room and board is the main

attraction of hesnjob but addedmi

that “it’s good experience in
working with people and also a
lot of fun.” -

. She said she feels “needed
and useful” and cited the sensi-
tivity training given to RA’s as
the greatest help in relating to
the people on her floor.

“A vestige of “in loco paren-
tis” is Carl Van Horn’s view of
the RA and he believes that this
is still necessary.

“Students are not all that re-
sponsible,” he said. “If some-
one can provide a stabilizing
force where there is such crowd-
ing, then they are serving an im-
portant purpose.”

Other RA’s doubt their abili-
ty to relate in a useful capacity.

y crisis

Mary Ann Kenny, though she
sees herself as “a counselor who
must _'.indicate knowledge and
trust”, recognizes the trend tow-
ards the obsolescence of the pro-
gram. There was a general con-
sensus among those interviewed
that the number of RA’s in cer-
tain dormitories could be reduc-
ed without ill effects.

“Any problems that the stud-
ents can’t work out themselves
‘require counseling,” said an RA
from South Holland, “and RA’s
just aren't qualified to adminis-
ter this kind of assistance no
matter howmuch they are con-
cerned.”

She stated that the approxi-
mately $130,000 spent for RA’s
could- be cut by roughly $13,000

  

if they cut their number by half « I‘

in Holland alone.

Students should be "consulted."
as to whether they would like _l'io{. ,
be spared this expense or have,

an RA’s “advice,” she said.

An RA from Tower C disa-rd

grees. “It is very important to
maintain the program,” he said.»

2 ‘ TERL is July, 1975.

Construction of the South PAT-
way was planned to start in 1971
_with the rehabilitation of the
‘Mount Washington Tunnel. Its
planned completion date is 1973.

The East PATway’s construc-
- tion is contingent upon acquiring
 the existing right-of-way from
' Penn Central Railroad. This right-
of-way is not expected to be ac-
quired until January 1, 1973.

The program, however, is not
. running on schedule.

 . In order to begin work on the
Ehabilitation of the Wabash
s Tunnel, an essential link in the
TERL project, PAT needs to ac-
quire the tunnel and city land at
both ends of the tunnel. On No-
vember 15, City Council passed
"ordinances granting these essen-
'1 tial elements to PAT, but Mayor
Peter Flaherty vetoed City Coun-
cil’s moves, delaying construc-
tion at the tunnel site at least
,. until December 6 when Council
W is expected to override the ve-
_t..c.>.es.__

Skybus debate rages,

Addressing himself specifi-
cally to this problem, Flaherty
said, “The aim of the Port Au-
thority and its proponents is to
begin piecemeal construction to
prevent any turning back, and

thus force the people into an ir-

rovocable position.” _

“It is arbitrary and capricious
to begin construction and reha-
bilitation of the Wabash Tunnel
site without having first acquir-
ed all the rights of way along
the proposed . . . 1ine.”

LOSS OF FEDERAL FUNDS?

Supporters of the TERL line
argue that unless the Skybus
project is carried through Alle-
gheny County will lose its Fed-
eral funds. Further, they add that
The Federal Program would be
more amendable to the Skybus
proposal than to a system using
steel wheels.

Cosetti countered by pointing
out that all that is needed to ob-
tain more federal funds is a new
application citing the new pro-
gram. He also stated that Feder-
al funds is a new application cit-

ing the new program. He also
stated that Federal .money is
spent on steel wheeled system
elsewhere, citing the new Balti-
more Rapid transit system as an
example. ‘

Although construction on the
Wabash Tunnel site will probab-
ly begin soon after December
6, because of the Port Authority’s
neglect to first acquire the right-
of—way along parts of the,TERL-
line, it is not certain how many

. other objections will be met
along the way. Construction i-s
behind schedule now, and with
further delays it will fall increas-
ingly behind schedule. However,
even when -Skybus and the PAT-
ways are built, it is questionable
whether they will provide serv-
ice equal to the amount of mon-
ey poured into the program.

Nader asks, for citizenship

(Continued from Page I) /

According to Nader, “the Board

will recruit full-time »representa- —

tives and set up policy." Recruits
will be drawn mainly from recent
graduates who want to work in a
public interest area.

“The essence of the challenge
of the group will be to discover if
society can stand citizenship; if
society can develop the resources
to make an occupation out of citi-
zenship,” said Nader.

 

The group will. work on re-
search and think about pertinent
problems, said Nader, endeavor-
ing to bridge the discontinuity and
the ups and downs of student con-
cerns, generally broken up by
exams, vacations, and such.

Nader said that through this or-
ganization students may realize
that “citizenship is not so much a
privilege as it is an obligation."

Naders appearance was spon-
sored by the Student Association
Programs Commission and En-
vironmental Action.

by SUZIE McDEVITT
I did, at one time, have a

friend, who, after a few Scotch-'

es, would turn to me and say,
“Ah, me girl, life, life ‘tis a won-
derland of existence, a phantas-
magoria of people and places
'and lives,” and wave his hands

and smile with a mellow light in

his eyes. .

- Now, besides .the strange delu-
sion my friend had of being Irish,

(his name was Kyprinski) he had

the idea that life, in its existence
was composed of various parts,
all of them somewhat tragic.
‘.‘Ye must guard against the
strange winds of fate;” waving
his fist. at.?me, “they will blow
ye into ‘a corner ye cannot es-
cape.”, an opinion he apparently
shares with Joyce Carol Oates,
whose latest novel Wonderland
deals with this concept of phan-
tasmagoria of personality.

And his delusion is the same

A as hers. Oates novel deals over a
large _rang,e,Mof_lrand (rural New,

York, to: Ann Arbor, Michigan,
to Chicago), time (1936 to 1971)
and character (Jesse; Harte, Pe-
derson, Perrault, Vogel) but in
none of these myraid backgrounds
does she find much happiness, or
joy,,or fullfillment.

Her main character, Je sse,
moves, child and man, as a kind
of robot propelled by his past to
go onward, upward, to become
normal, to escape, but to escape
to what? According to Oates,
nothing much but another ver-
sion of what has already gone
before.

Orphaned at 14, when his fath-
er murders his pregnant wife and
children, and then turns the gun

on himself, Jesse goes to live,

with his grandfather a while,
running away when he perceives
his grandfather breaking the trust
Jesse had felt between them.

He is adopted by a psychotic
physican, Karl Pederson, who has
succeeded (already) in turning his
children into monsters and his
wife into a secret alcholic. When
she tries to leave him, engaging
Jesse to help her, Pederson finds
out, comes after, his wife and
disowns Jesse. -

There is little in the way of
notable acting in the film, which
is understandable, since there are
no notable characters. Jesse White,

A’ Russell’s Asylum Choir lets ,1

/,

ASYLUM CHOIR ll
(Leon Russell and Marc Benno-
SW 8910)
by BOB BONN

The date on the back cover is
April, 1969, but back then few peo-
ple had heard of Asylum Choir. It
was a two—man group that got
great reviews. Their album did-
n’t sell.

Now, two and a half years later,
the Asylum Choir album has been
re-released because of the sudden
fame of one of its members, Leon
Russell.

Fans of Leon Russell will find

this album just as good as his,

more recent efforts. Doing mostly
fast songs in the same style he
uses now, few would be disap-
. pointed by Russell’s efforts before

1 2’ the Mad Dogs and Englishmen

days.

Marc Benno, the other fellow in
the group, is, I admit, a stranger
_to me. He does some singing on

the album, and plays guitar. His.

presence, though, is more of an
addition to Russell’s music than
a detraction, especially in his gui-
tar work.

Usually, albums that the com-
panies dig up from before the per-
former achieved stardom are
very disappointing, as is the case
with the Moody Blues’ In the Be-

ginning and The Beatles with Tony V
_Sheridan.

Asylum Choir, however, would
be a worthwhile purchase no mat-
ter when it was recorded.

Now, if we can only figure out
why we didn’t all buy it back in
1969 . . . -

V PAUL,“
PAUL (Paul $fookey—W$ 1912)

Paul Stookey,f0r years the low
voice in Peter, Paul and Mary,
has released an album of his own
entitled, appropriately enough,
Paul and. '

     

Stookey’s soloieffortl is worth a
listen. His songs show strong rock
influence and maybe a touch of

blues, but there’s no real term for '
' this type of music.

It has too much emphasis on a
beat and on electric instruments
to be pure folk, but it’s not really
rock, either.

Whatever, the best part is
Stookey’s clear, pleasant voice.
Lightly [weaving through some
pretty tunes, he makes his album
a refreshing change from heavy

rock and a_ bright change from

folk songs about, say, miners in V

New Castle.

The songs he has chosen tore-
cord are for the most part good
and well-suited to his style. A bit

disappointing, however,
tunes in which he seems to be
copying other aritists.

In “Give a Damn,” a song about
the Spanky and Our Gang release
of the same name, Stookey could
easily be confused with Arlo Gu-
thrie or maybe the Dylan of a few

C-riateful fDead alive and well ,

by BARRY COHEN

It seems as though every time the Grateful
Dead come out with a new album, it is not be-
cause they need more money to survive, or that
they want to stay popular, but because they have

something new to add to their style. ‘ .

Back in 1966,“v_v‘he_n San Francisco was first be-
coming the‘LSD capital of the world, the Grateful
Dead were making music because they mixed the
two basic types of San Francisco sounds—blues and
acid rock. ' V‘

They were also experimenting with amplifier
effects later on with Anthem of the Sun, their second

 album.

The individuality of the Grateful Dead, how-
ever, lies in their live performances. Realizing
this, they put out Live/Dead, a double album of
three sides of continual music, and a fourth side of
a blues numbercalled “Death Don't Have No Mer-

  

Merle Haggard. It’s title is “Mama Tried.” "' '
Among other numbers, which vary in style, are

the well-known rock hits, “Johnny B. Goode,” by 
Chuck Berry, and “Me and Bobby Magee,” by Kris 

Kristofferson.

As is characteristic, they adapt. both their I “
style and the number itself to create a sounduni-_. '

que to the Grateful Dead. This is, the reason thae I
group is so successful every time they add'a"new'%.—

style to their repertoire. '
V The combination of _Phil Lesh and Bill Kreutz-

man on bass guitar and drum creates such a driving ' 
force on this album that the overall results estab-1 

lish a very strong rock and roll sound.

In most parts, the bass is the dominating in}
strument Phil Lesh, with a long history in music,

‘was a starving classical composer writing symph-
onies that couldn’t get published until Jerry Gar-‘ 
cia, the Dead’s leading guitarist got a hold of him ]
and gave him a bass guitar. Since then,-he has ff ~

gone on to contribute his part in making the Grate-
ful Dead the remarkable group they aretoday. —

Along with the musicianship, the vocals on this
album are as good or better than any that have been ~-
recorded on their live albums to date.

Last year it was against UCLA when the Panthers had their
chance to play the nation’s best in hopes of an upset. Tomorrow
night i, the squad gets another opportunity against a quintet which
may well become the country’s finest before theiwinter is over-the

North Carolina Tar Heels.

A sellout crowd at Fitzgerald Field House (the first one in

years) is expected for the 8:00
p.m. tipoff.

was bestowed on it by Sports I]-

The Tar Heels’ popularity
among the experts stems from
several reasons. Last season, the
Tar Heels concluded with an im-
pressive 22-6 record. Additional-
ly, they handily won the Nation-
al Invitational Tournament.

Four of NC’s starters return
from last year’s super squad.
Three fWestern Pennsylvania
high school stars, Ambridge’s
Denny Wuycik, Bethel Park's
Steve Previs, and Penn Hills’

George Karl return along with
Bill Chamberlain.

In fact, a large contingent of
NC rooters from the surrounding

' area are expected to pack the

visitors’ stands. This‘ will be the
first time that the stellar trio has
returned to the Pittsburgh area
since its schoolboy days.

Wuycik averaged over 18
points a game last year, and
along with Chamberlain is’ be-
ing considered for national re-
cognition.

NC Coach Dean. Smith is nat-

chances, He hopes this is the,

4 -‘give us a tougher time tomorrow than _

by MARK SIGMON

A vengeful Michigan wrestling squad,
still smarting from the 17-15 defeat inflict-
ed upon it by the Panther grapplers last
season, opens the 1971-72 Pitt mat sched--,
ule at 2 p.m. tomorrow at the Field
House". Both Panther mentor Dave Adams
and Wolverine assistant coach Bill Johan-
nesen predict a cliffhanger.

“Pitt-Michigan wrestling matches. are
always tough and exciting,” remarked
Johannsen. “Like us, Pitt_is very strong in

' the lower weights, although both squads

have more than adequate upper weights.”

Adams said, “We’ll be counting on a
big crowd, just like last year. We’ll need
it. Michigan is confident that it can‘han-
dle every opponent on its schedule, which
includes Michigan State, Penn State, and
_kalahoma State. I know Michigan will

last year, if that’s possible.”

Four Pitt matmen, all capable of start-
ing, will not participate against the Wol-
verines. Steve Weiss, 118 pound plebe

fered last season, Veteran 142 pounder

Buddy Smeltz has quit the team.

Smeltz was unable to get a full scholar-
ship, and the athletic department failed
to find a part—time job for the experienced
grappler, who pinned Michigan’s Jerry
Hubbard to win last season’s dual meet.

Co-captain Willie Saloky (167) severely
wrenched his knee while wrestling over
Thanksgiving, and switching from the As-
troturf to the mats, John Chatman (158)

pounds last season, has moved into the 134 pound slot for tomorrow's opener against the

University of Michigan.

A glance into the crystal ball reveals

.,the following lineup:

l18—Two star freshmen, Pitt’s George
Bryant (PIAA state champ) and Michi-
gan’s Jim Brown (Ohio titlist), will break
the ice. Bryant copped third place in the
Chattanooga Open over Thanksgiving, los-
ing only’ to Oklahoma’s Gary Breece.

126—Pitt’s best, 1970 NCAA runnerup
Randy Payne, hopes to duplicate his 1970
triumph (at 134) over Jim Hagen, who was
sixth in the 1971 national tournament. Two
totally different styles clash here-Payne’s
exciting aggressiveness vs. Hagen’s cal-
culated determination. ‘

134—Edging teammate Dave Wylie for

the starting berth, Panther Gary McClure

will oppose either Wolverine Rick Neff or
Billy Davis. McClure thrashed the latter
last season at 126. I

 In its first appearence of the

TimVGrgurich’s hustling frosh
cagers easily handled the St.

The freshmen spent an hour

-not nearly as long setting the
pattern for the game. The Cubs, V
paced by the early heroics of

ﬁhighly touted Kirk Bruce, jump-
" ‘ed off to a quick lead and by

half time had built an 11 point
advantage, 42-31. '

Bruce, however,’ did not do it.-
‘ alone. Leroy Freeman, a West-

inghouse star last year, comple-
mented Bruce very‘ efficiently.
The two forwards tallied 24
first half points between them,
each with a dozen’. '

Willis Cardot, at guard, chip-
ped -in with 8 points and the
frosh seemed headed for a well.

In the second half, Bruce’ cool-
ed off, but Freeman and Cardot
took over offensively.

.  Freeman tallied 15 second half

points. Cardot, who scored seven
times from the free throw line,
finished with 13, in the closing
half. —

    
 

  

 
 

  Cubs romp in opener‘

Freeman’s 26 points led all
scorers and Cardot took second
honors with 21. Bruce, who did
not let up defensively, finished
with18. ‘

. Center Ed Williams contribut-
ed 9 points to the cause._Guards
Kevin Aul (7), Doug Slhanek
(5), and Rick Monroe (2) round-
ed out the Cub scoring. ‘

Defensively, the freshmen
played their type of game. Using
Grgurich’s tight man to man de-
fense, the Cubs limited St. Vin-

, cent to 31 first half points and

got even better in t-he second
stanza.

Trapping, sagging, and switch-
ing with the situation at hand,
the frosh held St. Vincent to
only 27 second half points.

Bruce was high, rebonuvnder 

both teams, as he pulled down‘

13 for the night. To go along

with his fine point production,
Freemen also grabbed 9 rebounds.

Slhanek skyed for 6.

The victory, coupled with last
year’s ten consecutive wins, now
gives Grgurich’s squad an eleven
game win . streak. However, a
continuation of the skien will de-
mand another balanced attack

Running its unbeaten string to seven this season, the Fijis (Phi I
Gamma Delta) rolled over Pi Kappa Alpha Wednesday afternoon, 26-8

thus capturing its second consecutive fraternity football championship.
Playing a ball control game, the Fijis hit paydirt in the opening

moments of the hard-hitting contest on a 40-yard TD aerial from Pete  .

Antinopolis to Paul Kalinsky.
Culminated by Antinopolis’ six-

point look-in pass over the mid-

dle to Wayne Pile, the 1970 league
MVP, this Phi Gam scoring drive

was highlighted by power sweeps ‘

around right end.

Pi Kappa Alpha’s_ lone touch-
down came in the second half on
a 30 yard strike from QB Greg Hy-
land to split end Rege Kauffman.

Led by the inspired play of de-
fensive ends Barry Sicard and
Bill Mamakos, the aroused Fiji
defense put continuous pressure

on both Pika signal callers, Hy-

land and Mike Nichols.

Pitt’s women’s varsity swim team ended its
dual meet ’71 campaign with an over—all record of
3-4.

The mermaids three victories were against

Carnegie-Mellon, Chatham, and West Virginia.

__ They were downed by Slippery Rock Ashland Col-
lege, Clarion, and Kent State. I

Virginia Grindle, Pitt’s" coach, felt that al-
though it was not a winning season, there was much
to be pleased about. The mermaids broke many of
their own records and throughout the year contin-
ued to show improvement.

The season will officially come to end when

Pitt holds the Invitational Relay, 2 p.m. Saturday,
Dec. 11, at Trees Pool.

   
 

 Saturday at the Field House.

The fate of Coach Warren Neiger’s gymnastic squad may conceiv-
, ably be predicted by the outcome of its first meet with Army, 2 p.m.

Pre-seasoh reports reveal that neither Pitt nor Army-is expected

 to be among the top gymnastic teams in the East this year, but a win

 A. .; here would be indicative of the
' j teams’ potential.

 Pitt’s chances are tarnished by
 ,,the ineligibility of Joe Gracik, its
' best performer of the side—horse
«and possible‘ EIGL medalist.
 Gracik transferred back tofPitt
from Georgia Southern University
and will be eligible after the sem-

Coach Neiger will rely upon
9 eight returning lettermen anchor-

Coach “Buzz” Ridl commented
before Wednesday night’s cager
opener with Gettysburg, that
“this one we’re pretty sure of
winning.” Obviously someone for-
got to inform the Bullets as they
forced the Panthers to come from
behind to win the contest, 80-67.

Using their superior height and
ball handling ability, the Cats sur-

Breather (chokes cagers

mounted a two point deficit at
halftime (33-31) and defused the
fired up Gettysburg squad. Out-
scoring the Bullets, 49-34, in the
second half, the Panthers came
alive via the fastbreak com-
bination of Cleveland Edwards to
Billy Knight, complimented by a
17 point performance by veteran
forward Mike Paul. -

teams record breaking perform-
ance in practice and in an ex-
hibition meet with Carnegie-

Mark Wallace has broken, ac-
cording to Bradshaw, the team’s
record in both the 100-yard and
the 200 yard backstroke. 1

The medley relay team is 15
seconds better than last year’s
as with the freestyle relay which
is nine seconds better.

Both marks are good enough
for team records. The freestyle
relay is better than the pool re-
cord in that event.

A most unique pool record
will be set with Saturday’s meet
at 2:00 p.m. The ‘Ti'mettes",
chosen from the ranks of the un-
dergraduate women, will monitor
all stop—watches and time dials
for the meet.

the first half, lead the Panthers in
scoring with 18 points. Feeding
him expertly was Edwards who
contributed 11 points of his own.

Refusing to succumb to the high-
ly (touted Panther squad, Gettys-
burg took advantage of numerous
Pitt turnovers to all but complete-
ly dominate the first half. Led by
Jay Buchner’s 19 points (top in
the contest) and Perry Clark’s

ten, the Bullets were still in the

game halfway into the second
half, 54-49, though they finally
slowed down during the home
stretch.

An indication of how determined .

the Bullets really were surfaces
in the final rebounding figures.
The Panthers. edged Gettysburg
out 24-22, although the tallest
player on the Bullet squad is 6-4.

Kent V Scott, Pitt’s veteran
guard also scored in double fig-
ures, pouring in 10 points. Scott
led - thetweam in point production
last"season: Paul O’Gorek netted
nine points and Carl Morris had
eight in a very balanced scoring
effort by the Cats.

After 'a shaky first half the Pan-.

thersappeared ready to break the
game open after the second half
tip-off. Reeling off seven straight
points the Cats took the lead only
to loose it five minutes later,‘ 41-
40. A determined effort by the
whole squad was then required to

' salvage what was predicted to be

a breather for the Cats. A

Wednesday’s victory over the
Bullets appears to have qualified
the blatent optimism surrounding
the ’72 Cats. Tomorrow’s game
against North Carolina will pro-
vide the real test. '
