ENRIILLMENT FlIilIIIE
I ANNHUNEEII BY,
  REGISTRAR

The latest report of the registra-
tion figures shows .a. decrease in en-
rollment for the second semester
term. Registrar J. G. Quick attributes
the falling off in registration to gen-
eral business depression. Many stu-
dents have been unable to secure em-
ployment to help payvtheir expenses
and have consequently deferred reg-
istration until next term. Mr. Quick
predicts an increase in registration
in the fall.

The registration figures for the.
school term beginning February 9,
are: '

College, 1,151.

Day Economics, 393.

Evening School, 579.

School of Education, 277. .

Vocational Department of ‘School
‘of Education, 107.

School of Engineering, 209.
School of Mines, 105.
Graduate ‘School, 177. _ ._ V .
The number of uew“sui‘&ents
istered follows: . ' '

Freshman, 61.

Sophomore, 7.

Juniors, 5.

Seniors, 4.

Specials, 70. I
' Evening Economics, 31. '

Department of Vocational Educa-
tion, 11. , .

Graduate School, 11.

Total number of new students reg-
istered, 200. -

Total number of students register-
ed in Graduate and Undergraduate
Schools, 3,000. ' , 1

Several changes in registration
have been instituted at. the Univer-
sity this term. Although .these
changes somewhat simplified the pro-.
cess of registering. of students, there
are still a few defects that will be
eliminated next fall. Registrar Quick
gives as the first defect the length
of the registration period, which cov-
ered a period of approximately three
weeks. Blanks were secured on Jan-
uary 28, preliminary registration took
place on January 30, and final reg-
istration on February 6, 7‘ and 8.‘The
second defect, is the fact that the
marks were not handed in before the
preliminary registration and advisors
consequently permitted failures to re-
register for subjects in which they
had failed. This resulted in many‘
withdrawals, change of courses and

 

 

other unnecessary procedures.

Dr. Wellington’ Koo, Chinese Am-
b-assador to Great Britain spoke at
a special assembly’ in Memorial
Hall yesterday morning at 10:30
o'clock. Dr. Koo headed the dele-
gation to the Armament Conference
from the Republic of China, he was
former Minister of Finance to the
United States and is an Alumnus of
‘Columbia. University, Dr. -Koo is un-
der forty years of age.

Dr. Koo’s address was short
and informal. He stated that he was
an old acquaintance and former pu-
pil otf Chancellor Bowman. He
emphasized the. importance- of educa-
tional institutions and the great help
that American educational schools
had given China. ,

He stated that American institu-
tions are training the future leaders
of China. That they were the torch
‘bearers of a. new civilization for
China. making ‘possible the Chinese
Republic, That at the present time
there are 2,200 Chinese students in
America. '

Judge Buffington helped to wel-
come the Chinese plenipotentiary
with a short address. He began
with leading the students in a
“hand clap.” He stated that Dr.
Koo came to Pittsburgh at the right
time to see the city, because Pitts-
burgh can only be seen in the right
light time in times of economic de-
pression, when there is no smoke.‘

With a few words of welcome
Chancellor Bowman closed the as-

 

 

e.’ annual Junior Promenade, the big-
gest event on the ‘University’s ‘social calendar, have been com-,
pleted according toan announcementpmade yesterday by the chair-

 I-.~.n.n»n~ WEEKL
THE “JUNIOR PROM” 01-‘ 1903 .

 

As the “Junior Prom” is to be held Friday Welling of this week at the Hotel Schenley Ball Room, and there

will be quite a large representation of the alumni present in addition to all the undergraduates who can scrape up
the necessary cash, the Alumni Editor believes that the above picture of one of the first “Junior Proms" will be

mighty interesting to “Weekly” readers.

It is not the -first prom held at Pitt, but it is the second, bein. held in
1903 in the Gymnasium in the old Western University Building, Perrysville avenue, North Side.

We have a pic-

ture of theiﬁrst prom held in 1902, but unfortunately it is not clear enough to have a cut taken so that we can

reproduce in “The Weekly." 4

The two pictures of the proms were furnished by William Archie 4Weldin of the class of 1902 with a lot of

information, giving names of some who attended, etc.

The ‘suggestion was made, by Mr. 'Weldin that we dig

around through the records, and also confer’ with some of the old timers, like Alex. Silverman, and get additi nal

data.

We have done this, Silverman being‘the best source of information.

The ﬁgures in the original pictures

were numbered, but in the making of the cut, it was impossible to reproduce these very well, so it is pretty hard

to identify many of them.

Here are some of the ones who attended, however, the names being familiar to the

Pittites of those days, and to others who have made a hobby of reading up on Pitt history 20 years or so ago.

First and foremost is “Uncle Dan" C

now 83 years old.

“UNCLE DAN” THERE

arhart, _who was then dean of the "Engineering School, and who is
Dr. Carhart, with Mrs. Carhart, are in the foreground of the picture, the good doctor being

numbered 1 on his shirt -front. .It may be thatthe keen-eyed readers can-distinguish this number. Florence Car-
hart and Charles Carhart, dauhter and son of the cod pair, are numbered 3 and 4. Mrs. John A. Brashear, wife
of good old “Pa” Brashear (both now deceased), is in the picture, as well as Herman Schmitz, professor of Ger-
man and History, and one of the real characters of the faculty in those days.

Others in the picture are Professor'Smith,.popular member of the School of Engineering faculty; Miss Kirk,
who is well known to Mines graduates; Dean Fettermann, Edward Godfrey, then professor of «Structural Engineer-
ing; Earl W. Paul, _now a banker in Upland, California; Edward Worcester, '01; W. A. Weldin, who furnished
the picture, and Malcolm McConnell, who is now superintendent of the Carnegie Steel Company at Mlngo Junc-

tion, Ohio.

Professor Silverman has identified Roy C.-McKenna, Pitt's well-known and loyal

raduate, who is presi-

dent of therVanadium Steel Company; W. F. Eisenbeis, '02: F. B. Chalfant, '02; R. W. P ry, '03; J. Ralph Park,
former secretary of the University, and recently appointed one of the city magistrates by Mayor Mace,

“TEA HOUNDS" YEARS AGO‘

The “tea hounds” of those days seem to have attended all the proms, as in the picture of the first prom
of '02 we notice about the same names, with the addition of Dick Wallace, Hugh Fullerton, Professor Phillips, Pro-

fessor Des Islets, Professor Hunter, “Dave” Hogg and Miss Friesell.
“Observe the romance, H. L. Fullerton, '02; Miss Friesell, 02."
can tell but what the romance started at that very prom?

Mr. Weldin has a notation on the picture—
Miss Friesell is now Mrs. H. L. Fullerton.
No one, perhaps, except Mr. and Mrs. Fullerton.

Professor Silverman, head of ‘the Department of Chemistry, was one of the boys who attended the first
prom, and he gives us the interesting tip that his girl was Miss Blanche May, Philadelphia, who he claims was

“the belle of th_e ball.”
hart.

Professor Silverman and Miss May led the grand march with “Uncle Dan” and Mrs‘. Car-
It is worth noting that a romance similar to the Friescll-Fullerton combination did not result here,“ as‘

Professor Silverman’s wife is a former Miss Elrose Reizenstein, sister of H. S. Reizenstein, Eng. '10.

Professor Silverman adds the followingnames of H1086 atteﬂding the ﬁV'Sl-' PY'0m=

vantage under which the clinic was
conducted, it was a. most gratifying
success. It is intended that further
clinics will be conducted- in the fu-
ture. It is also a demonstration of the
fact that the ‘Medical Alumni of the
University of Pittsburg-h care well
able ‘to carry on and conduct success-
fully a clinic.

During the clinic an announcement
was made by Dr. R. J. Behan, who is
president of the Medical Alumni As-
sociation that all those who desire
to become members should send their
names to Dr. H. J. Benz, secretary
of the association at the City-County
building, Pittsburgh, Pa. It was also
suggested during this clinic that
others of the same character be in-
stituted soon. At the present time
there are no dues, the expenses of.

ten by the executive comniittee of

  Fllll “HIJME l3llNEEllT”

Various student activities are mak-
ing a more insistent demand every
year for support from the alumni, and
with the aggressive management and
the systematic way they are’ going
about their boosting, it is assured

that the grads will show thevsame pep _

that they do in the athletic teams,

notably football. One of the latest or-
ganizations that is making an appeal
to the grade is the Pitt Musical Clubs
forXtheir home concert at Carnegie
Music Hall, March 22 and 23. The
manager of this organization is T. E.
Little, R. N. Parkhill being assistant
manager. They are organizing a sys-
tematic campaign for selling tickets
to the concert among the grads, and
will select a list of prospects with the
aid of the alumni secretary.

It has been suggested that a fea-
ture that will appeal to the alumni
will be the appearance of the “Old
Guard” of the Musical Clubs, who
were a feature of Pitt activities twen-
ty-five yearsago, and Manager Little
is going to make a. determinedreffort
to line up “Jack” High and his gang
of songsters for a few selections at
the Home Concert. Several years ago
Manager “Art” Haines of the Musical
Club (we think it was “Art”) prevail,-
ed on the “Old Boys” to come out and

. sing, and they certainly made a big

hit. It was one of the finest features

‘ever arranged by the Musical Club.
,and if Manager Little and his crowd
of songsters can get the same feature

for this year no doubt there will. be
many of the grads who will be falling
all over themselves to get tickets.-

The first regular meeting of the ._

Pitt Engineering Club committee on
Prospectus and Publicity was held
Friday evening, February 10, in Thaw
Hall. The first matter taken up was
the question of publicity to be given
the act of legislature regulating .the
licensing of professional engineers
and land surveyors. It was decided
that some notice should be sent to
the membership of the association ‘ad-
vising them of the law and suggest-

ing that they secure a copy of it, and
a. copy of the necessary application
blanks. This notice, however, will not
be sent out until some other circular
information is distributed.

Chairman J. W. W. Hallock ap-
pointed ‘a sub-committee on Prospec-
tus, conslsting of Prof. Dyche, Hal-
lock and Mr. Henry. This commit-
tee is to assemble all data which is
considered applicable to the publica-
tion referred to. It was decided that
the publication should take the form
of the bulletin entitled “Co-operative
plan of Engineering Education,”
which was published originally -by the
School of Engineering in 1918. The
question of financing this publication
will be decided later. ’

The matter of publicity in The Pitt
Weekly and in the Pittsburgh daily
papers, pertaining to individual mem-
bers of the association, was carefully

‘discussed. The chairman of the com-

mittee was authorized to proceed to
make up? an information blank which
would be sent to the older alumni
who are members df this association,
with at view to securing interesting
biographical sketches for publication.

The matter of a propaganda cam-
paign in the interests of Engineering
at Pitt was discussed a.nd it wa.s~de-
cided to omit this from the activities
of the committee until the committee

on High and Preparatory Schools
have an opportunity to ‘undertake
their work.

It was decided that the next meet-
ing of this committee "should be held
on Thursday, February 23 at 12:30
p. m., at the William Penn Hotel Caf-
eteria, the committee then to adjourn
to the rooms of the Engineering So-
ciety of Western Pennsylvania to
take up some of the problems outlin-
ed above. The secretary was in-
structed to send out notices of this
meeting in due time.

APRIL pm PANTHER
“AlllMNl NllMlll3ll”

The management of The Pitt
Panther has announced that the .April
issue will be known as the “Alumni
Issue,” it being the intention to have
all the art and other contributions
come from the “grads.” C. R. Wil-
liams is the Alumni Editor, and he
wants contributions from any Pitt-
_ites who are not in the undergradu-
ate ranks. It does not matter whether
they were on The Panther staff when
they were at college or not. Contribu-
tions are solicited from the gradu-
ates of the various schools. The is-
sue will go to press April 12 and
copy must be in the editor’s hands a
week or so before that time. Let the
clevermen ‘among the alumni now
get busy and ‘send in material for this
issue! It will be the first“ of its kind
ever gotten out ;by The Panther and
will be sure to create a lot of inter-
est. ‘

Business Manager Charles L. Gar-
son is going to ‘make a. special effort
to boost the circulation of The Pan-
ther for this issue and is on the look-
out for subscriptions now. As the
Alumni Editor has often pointed out
The Panther is a mighty nice thing,
especially for a doctor or dentist to
have on his waiting room table. The
sick and infirm, or those who are
looking for relief from a toothache,
always want something to read when
they are waiting for the doctor. Why
not let them look over The Pitt Pan-
ther? It will serve the double purpose
of keeping their ills off their mind
and also be of advertising value for
Pitt. Suzbscription can be sent to the
alumni office or direct to the Business
Manager, Garson, care Pitt Panther,
the University.

’ FOR THE CRABBERS

Although it has long since ceased
to be representative of the best type
of sportsmanship, there are always a
number of students ,who imist upon
defaming the appointed arbiter at any
athletic contest. They just like to

jeer at the referee of a football game.
They like to sneer atthe umpire of
a baseball contest. They like to leer
at -the referee of a basketball game,
which brings us to the point: There
have not yet been such demonstra-
tions; at the University as to call
forth a violent attack upon the class
named above, but it is ‘in the best
interests of the sport 0 remind them
of the true feelings offthe real sports-
man. ,-
A basketball game, isgone of the
hardest athletic conﬂicts to admin.-
ister._ Not only must the referee
know the game thoroughly, but he
must actually be almost as fast as
the players themselves, to‘ keep up
with the ball. It is made harder be-
cause of the nature of the contest,
which is so rapid that violations of
the rules are hard to detect. The
close proximity of the spectators to
the playing ﬁeld makes the job more
-personal. than the work of a foot-
ball judge. It is impossible for the
referee to watch every one of the
ten players at the same time and all
the time, but there will forever be
somebody in the stands who can see
a point he has overlooked. Probably
many fouls are committed which are
not penalized--the character of the
game makes that inevitable. The fact
remains and this is the point at is-
sue, that the referee is doing his best,
and deserves the backing of the real,
sportsman, and not the wholesale con-
demnation -so often received.
Football was once a game, for the
brawny and interested only a few.
Now it is a game for the brainy and
commands the invterestof many hun-
dreds of thousands. In the same way
has basketball developed from a
rough, unscientiﬁc sort of contest to
a highly specialized test of speed and
skill. When basketball games were
merely transplantations of football to
an interior, the sport remainéd in the
background of colllegiate activities.
It has changed, and the fast, clean
game now demanded. has placed it
in the front rank of major sports.
Our own coach in a statement to a
Denver paper says that the game
must be kept clean to‘ keep it good.
At. times the referee appears to

held balls frequently, but in the great
majority of cases the " ultimate effect
of such a program is to speed up
the game.
Friday night at the Armory. Had
Dana allowed the men, to ﬁght for
the ball, the affair would have turned
into‘ a rough and tumble session.
it was, he kept them after the ball
every minute and never once allowed
the game to drag because some man
wanted to play the opponent instead
of the ball. Only by such refereeing
can basketball be improved, and the
idea meets with the approval of real
sportsmen who are solicitous for the
welfare of the game.‘ Students gain
nothing but a lack of appreciation
from sportsmen when they hoot the
|'oﬁ‘ici‘~al.— .He «is trying hard to make
the players play a clean, fast game,
and he deserves the support ‘-of every
spectator. Further,’we, can rest as-
sure-d that an unfair official will not
be tolerated by any conference coach,
and? the most ‘bit-ter of rivals do not
care to win through the grace of the
referee. What we need is more
courtesy. ,  '

In this same connection,the jeering
of the rooters at some misplay on
the part ‘of the opponents does not
indicate good sportsmanship and does
not -help the evening in any way. If
students will spend their time shout-
ing encouragement to the Varsity,
there will be little time left for crab-
ibing. The present -season is booked
ito see some of the fastest basketball

lever played in this league, and it is.
time for every student to acquaint!

;as well as the rules of the game.-—

‘Is COLLEGE FOOTBALL BECOM-
ING PROFESSIONAL?

 

President Lowell of Harvard has
made some damaging statements

more essential activities of college.
These we ﬁnd followed by the dis-
missal of a prominent coach on -the
-charge of buying his players. Now
we are treated to a sensational ex-
posure of a large number of players
on two of the big teams of the coun-
try, Notre Dame and Illinois. It is
openly declared that some of the men
received a ﬂat sum for their work
in a post-season gridiron contest.
Names are given, and the story
makes the situation look bad, es-
pecially when numerous college of-
ﬁcials have been quick to agree with
President Lowell.

proach. In all fair
garding the great. interest students
have in collegiate athletics, it must
be admitted that the evidence is
rather weighty on- -the opposition.
Huge stadiums are being built, not
merely to accommodate the member-
ship of the colleges, but to increase
the seating capacity and thereby in-
crease the ﬁnancial proﬁt of the
games. Maneuvering for places on
the schedule has become a matter for
ﬁnanciers,’ with the larger schools.
Games are played where the most
money can be made at the box office.
The best teams are not always match-
ed, because some others bring more
money to the coffers.

Intersection contests are planned
for the most part with no other pur-
pose in view than the reaping of.a
rich harvest of ‘coin. What did Cen-
tre prove by beating Arizona? And
What did we learn when§Wa-shington
and Jefferson fougt California to a
scoreless tie? We‘ﬁnd theyso-called
Big Three meeting teams they have
picked for the purpose mostly, n-ot
squads that have demanded a contest
by virtue of their prestige. The
struggles on the gridiron are made
the climax of a larger struggle from
the treasure-r’s end, to gather in the
largest gate receipts.’ ‘In our own
conference the situation is more deli-
cate. A certain number of games ab-
solutely have to be played with the
ﬁnancial‘ end in view, or the expenses
of the teams cannot be met." ,

Baseball is not the collegiate sport
it once was because professionalism
crept in. _As long as organized base-
ball continues on such a scale. college
baseball will not develop. The reason
professional football has not achieved
any greater prominence is because the
sport has -been conﬁned -to amateurs
closely, and associated with in:s*titu-
tional activities. Justas soon as the
implied tendency to professionalize
football is proved ‘and extended, we
shall ﬁnd the gridiron pastime drop-
ping in its importance ‘on the campus.
Football is on probation, and the au-
thorities of. the schools where the
“modern ideas” are most practiced
know it. While the East is ﬁghting
it -out between the professors’ and the
coaches, the West can well do alittle
thinking to ascertain whether or not
this section of the country is liable
to condemnation, or is moving toward
the condition now charged against
football in gencral.—-Colorado Silver

The ‘Chess Club matches have been
progressing slowly. The standing of
the teams in the inter-class tourna-
ment has not changed, no matches
having been played this week.

In the championship tournament
the defeat of Cyrus G. Dunkle, for
three years the champion of the
University‘ by Norman J. Harrar,
last year’s
the ‘big surprise of the season. It
was generally expected that Dunkle
would again win but he fell. before
the consiustently brilliant game of
Harrar. The two games played,
both of -which were won by *H.arrar,
were probably the best exhibition of
the game that has ever been given
by students of the University.

The fourth position on the team
is still in doubt. Hank and Sarraf
have not played their deciding game
yet; The winner of this match will
meet Ruderman in the ﬁnals for the

RELAY TEAM Tu lllilil 
m LAEATETTE, SATURIIAY

_.¢..._.......__..—...

The varsity track season opens
this coming Saturday when the
Panther sprint medley relay (team
meets the team representing Lafay-
ette“ College in a_ dual race at the
annual indoor games of A Johns Hop-
kins University .-at Baltimore. The
makeup of the Pitt team is being de-
termined by trials this week, the
cnly, certainty being that I-Ijays will
run the mile.  . ’ ' ' "

_PI'0spe»Clt\s« point to an exceedingly
close race, for then Lafayette team

of the strongest college teams in
the country, three of their men be-
ing among the best known track men
in college «circles. tLeconey will,
without a doubt, V run the 220-yard
dash for them, with ‘Malich, former
Harrisburg Tech - star, who has done
under 50ﬁseconds’ in the quarter-mile
negotiating, the double-furlong, while
Bob Crawford, one of the country’s
‘best milers-, will be their anchor
man. , . ’
On paper this team should be sev-
eral -seconds ‘better ' than the Panth-

the fact“ that the Gold and Blue
track men are probably in better
shape than Lafayette’s because of
the ‘excellent facilities for winter
training afforded by the ‘indoor track.
Should Saturday's race. put ‘Crawford
and Hays off to an even start-on the
mile; it should be a humdinger, for
it will be the first meeting between
those two. stars, both of whom have
conquered a number of the best
milers in the country. ‘I-la‘.VS. in ad-
dition - to running the mile on the
relay team“, will compete in a special
1,000 yard invitation race ‘against
some of the best .men at that dis-
tance in -the east. ~ .

The Panthers, after losing three
consecutive games came back strong
and defeated Muskingum College
Wednesday night by a 45 to 21 score

at the Motor Square Garden. I

Musksingum scored ﬁrst, but Jordan

was not long in locating the basket
and by the time the ﬁrst half was over
he had registered six ﬁeld goals, Lev-
ison and Funk had registered two
each and Red Byers had caged his
usual side shot. The -score at this
period stood 30 to 12.
Andy Kerr -sent his second. string
men ‘in at the beginning of the sec-
ond _half and they showed to good ad-
vantage, but the Panther offense was
not so powerful and the rapid scor-
ing ceased; they were able however
to make 15 points as compared to nine
emade by the New Concord squad in
this half.

Jordan was easily the star of the
game, scoring in all nine ﬁeld goals
and two fouls; the only outstanding
feature for the Muskingum ﬁve was
the remarkable playing of Moore, who

 

ﬁeld goals and registering 17 out of
20 tries fromlthe ‘foul line.

In the preliminary the Pitt Fresh-
men defeated. the West Virginia

has been placed upon a ﬁrm basis
by the formation of the inter-col-
legiate fencing league. Pitt had a

member of this league. Due to the
war the interest in the sport was al-
lowed to lag and the University
dropped out., It is the purpose of
the present fencing club to once again

A LITTLE DOPE  

PITT AND STATE EVEN UP .

Pitt and State are again even on the season's standing between the
two schools in all branches of sport. This is especially true of ._the
varsity teams, which battled to a scoreless draw on the gridiron and have
likewise fought without decision on the basket ball court, each team has
suffered a defeat on its own floor at the hands of the other. The Freshman
teams are little better off, the Pitt cubs being supreme in football and the
State Freshmen twice victorious at basket ball.
to find the baseball and track honors also Q
schools. While it is almost two months yi
basis of last year's scores and the records of the Freshman teams, the
Panthers should have the edge on the diamond, while it will be a most‘
difficult task for the Pitt track team to take the measure of the State run-
ners this year, with ‘Shields and Helfrich smashing records on the Mt.
Nittany track. Our Freshman track team, however, should stand an excel-
lent chance of defeating the State Freshmen in track this year, although the
caliber of State’s Freshman material is, of coursefunknown as yet.

 

It should not be surprising
ually divided between the two
’until baseball season, on the

rivalry exists anywhere than between

~Pitt and Penn state or if keener-_competltion between two schools in all
branches of athletics can be found, for when the Pitt Panther and the Nit-
tany Lion meet, fur is always sure to fly and no team should ever makethe
mistake of being too corifident of victory when it faces the other, for in no
branch of sport is a team of either school so supreme as to justify it. D It is
too bad that the two teams will ‘not have another opportunity to st together
on the basket ball floor, for Pitt adherents would be
bit on the outcome of another Pitt-State game, especially after the Panther’s
fine showing last Saturday in completely outplaying and defeating the Lions
has been accomplished by -very _few teams in

willing to stake a good

 

THE EASTERN TRIP .

_ The Panther floor team starts its annual eastern invasion tonight and
its performances will be watched with keen interest by every Pitt student.
The trip while consisting of only three games, sizes up as one of the hardest
ever taken by .a Pitt basket ball team. Tonight Cor_ne|I is met at Ithaca
and it will be quite some feather in the Panther’s hat’ if it can secure a
victory, for ‘Cornell only recently handed «old Pen '
their first beating in two years and one of the worst handed a Penn team
year won from Pitt in an early season
r prowess is well established throughout
‘Cobgate will be met tomorrow night and another hard battle is to

‘ . Last year Pitt was fortunate enough to defeat the Hamilto-
nians in a free-scoring contest and it is to be hoped that they can repeat.
The trip closes at Syracuse Friday night, when the Panthers will seek re-
venge for the defeat at the hands of the Oran
,Garden.. Syracuse will reign the favorite however by reason of having de-
feated us on our own floor and having a reco

lFijis Win Broad Jump,

Phi Gamma Delta again took the
lead in the interfraternity track
series’ by capturing the broad jump
last Friday. Kappa Sigma dropped
back to second place and is now one
point behind the Bhi Gamms. The
Sigma Chis are in third place, with
the Sig Alpha fourth, and Phi Delts
ﬁfth. The margin between these
ﬁve teams and the other eight» is
rather large, and the A bottom_ eight
should show some keen competition
in the succeeding three events to keep
out of the cellar when the ﬁnal stand-
ing is determined. Revision in the
present standing was made necessary
by the withdrawal ‘of the Alpha Phi
"Alphas from the race when it was
found that competition was limited
to members of the Interfraternity
Conference. ‘

he real competition in the broad
jump was between the Phi Gamms
and the Sigma Chis and both teams
averaged over 19 feet, which is ex-
cellent jumping and far surpasses last
year’s‘ marks. The Phi Gamms how-
ever had three of the four men who
did over 20 feet and ﬁnished with a.
margin of ﬁve inches per man over
the Sigma Chis.

The race for third position was
exceptionally close, there being a
margin of less than two inches per
man between the third a-nd ﬁfth teams,
Phi Delta Theta, Kappa. Sigma and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon being bunched.
The three teams ﬁnished however in
that order, the Phi Delts averaging
18 feet 1 3/5 inches, the Kappa Sigs
18 feet 1 inch, while the S. A. E.’s.
were within one.-ﬁfth of an inch of
18 feet. The Theta Delta Psis/were
sixth and move up to eighth place in
the standing of the teams.

The jumping this year was far bet-
ter than that of last yer as is evi-
denced by the fact that nine men,
did over 19 feet to one last year,
four of the nine this year doing over
20 feet. '1‘-om Martin‘, Sigma Chi,
was the individual winner with a leap
of 20 feet 6 inches. Seventeen lnen
got over 18 feet, of which a number
show possibilities -of developing into‘
star broad jumpers. _ »

ut three more events remain on
the schedule of events as -originally

following order on the ‘succeeding
Fridays: one-mile relay, distance
medley relay: and two-mile relay.
The one-mile. relay is scheduled for
this Friday and will consist of four
quarter-miles.

Results of the broad jump, shpw-
ing the individual place and jump of
each man,. this fratern‘ity’s average
jump being opposite its name, and
the names of the ﬁve best men in each
fraternity being in bold face, inas-
much as only the jumps of the ﬁve
best were averaged to obtain the
team score. - ‘
