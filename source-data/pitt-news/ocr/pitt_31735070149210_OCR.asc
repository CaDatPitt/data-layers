Board
denies fundsq

' By Michael Ringling
Staﬂ” Writer

The Wazobia Cultural Festival took
center stage for a third time at Tues-
day night’s Student Government
Board meeting.

Conﬁision surrounded the African
Student Organizations latest request
for the festival. This time the group
asked for $4,624.14 to fund facility,
rental and technical costs at Belle-
ﬁeld Hall, an ad in The Pitt News and
the honorarium for comedian Don’t

Jealous Me.

At the Jan. 31 SGB meeting, ASO
withdrew the original $10,079.14
request for Wazobia after the Board
raised concerns about documentation
for two parts of the request: supplies
the group intended to purchase from
a thrift store and the fee and travel
funding for the comedian.

Last week, ASO requested
$6,160.42 to pay for an honorari-
um, airfare, ground transportation
and lodging for three designers who
would contribute to the fashion show
portion of the event. The group also
requested money for security, cos-
tumes and an honorarium for acro-
bats. ASO did not request funding
for the comedian Don’tJealous Me
at the time.

The Board approved $3,660.42
and denied $2,500 for fees for ac-
robats.

This week, the Board spent more
than 10 minutes talking about the re-
quest and Went back and forth about
how much to allocate — ultimately
voting to fund everything but the fee
for the comedian.

The Allocations Committee ini-
tially recommended that the Board
deny the request in ﬁill because the
committee felt that ASO had already
received enough funding for the

hree groups celebrate black women's histories

By Gretchen Andersen
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

With February ending and March
about to begin, three Pitt organi-
zations joined forces to celebrate
Black History Month and Women’s
History Month. .

“You don’t know where you ar
going until you know where you
came from,” said Gina Roussos,
president of Campus Women’s
Organization.

Her remark reﬂected the theme
of Tuesday night’s lecture, “His—
torical Women of the African
Diaspora,” held in the William Pitt
Union by CWO, the Black Action
Society and the African Students
Organization.

About 25 students attended the
30-minute presentation, which
touched on the accomplishments

.of several women of African de-
scent. The group mentioned his-
torical women such as Henrietta

Lacks, Flo Kennedy, Audre Lorde
and Ntozake Shange. ’

“Women of color have had even
more so difficult historically, and
to see such accomplishments
makes me feel inadequate,” said
Julie Anne Evans, a member of
CWO. “You need to know who has
contributed‘ to history, especially
the accomplishments of minori-
ties.”

Darah Patterson, who present-

ed a few slides, is the BlackLine .

Magazine Chair Co—Editor and a
member of the Black Action Soci-
ety. She discussed the importance
of recognizing the often over-
looked role of women in history.
“We felt women were greatly
marginalized in history, and this
was a good jump into Women’s
History Month,” Patterson said.
The presentation named a
number of women from Pitt
who’ve made important contri-
butions to both history and the
present, such as the late Wangari

Maathai, the 2004 Nobel Peace A

Prize winner and a 1966 Master of
Science graduate of Pitt. Maathai
was the ﬁrst female from East and
Central Africa to earn a doctorate.
She foundedthe Green Belt Move-
ment, an organization focused on
environmental conservation and
community development. H
Another important woman
from Pitt was Shona Sharif, a se-
nior lecturer and advisor in the
Department of Africana Studies
at Pitt. She served on the Pennsyl-
vania Council on the Arts’ Dance
Advisory Panel from 19 93 through
1995. Sharif taught African—Amer-

' ican health issues and African-

American, African and Caribbean
dance classes at Pitt.

The lecture’s attendees also
discussed Flo Kennedy. Kennedy
was a U.S. civil rights attorney, po-
litical activist and radical feminist.
She was one ofthe founders of the
National Organization for Women
and founded the Feminist Party,

launching Shirley Chisholm’s
failed candidacy for president of
the United States.

The presentation also featured
women outside of the United
States, such as Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, the 24th president of Li-
beria and the ﬁrst elected female
head of state in Africa. Johnson
Sirleaf received the Nobel Peace
Prize in 2011. She also earned the
Presidential Medal of Freedom in

‘ 2007.

Efe M. Oghoghome, commu-
nity outreach co—chair of CWO,
acknowledged the importance of
Black History Month as it comes
to an end. V

“lt’s important to celebrate
Black History Month because
black history is inextricably linked
to American history. We need to
honor the legacy and their con-
tributions. It’s American history,
we ‘need to talk about it like we do
Asian history and Women’s his-
tory,” she said. jg

Dina said she hoped to bring another one to this
year’s event.
“We want a lighthearted air to the show,”
Dina said. “It is part of the culture to laugh.”
Board member Gordon Louderback moved
to amend the motion to pay the costs of using

Belleﬁeld Hall and the technicians fees and pro— _

jectorassociatedwith it, but notthe costs associ-
ated with The Pitt News ad or the comedian.

The Board voted to approve Louderback’s
amendment, but then Board Member Halim
Genus moved to approve the request in full.
When the Board voted on Genus’s amendment,
Genuswasthe only Board memberwho voted to
approve. Board member Zoe Samudzi abstained
from the vote.

“I abstained because I didn’t feel I could be
impartial,” Samudzi said. “I personally want
the event to go on as [ASO] wants the event to
go on}?

Following that proposed amendment to

the request, Board member Olivia Armstrong
moved to ﬁind the use of Belleﬁeld and all as-
sociated costs with the venue, as well as an ad
in The Pitt News.

The Board approved the amendment, and
the motion passed. The Board approved $874.15
and denied $3,749.99.

Following the allocations requests, Transpor-
tation Safety Committee Chair Richard White
added some humor to the meetingwith a quick
birthday wish for the University of Pittsburgh.

He then said he had “disgusting” news about
Market Central.

He cited a report by the Allegheny County
Health Department regarding the on—campus
eatery.

The Food Safety Assessment report, avail-
able online, found that during an inspection on
Sept. 16, 2011, the department found “several
live roaches in bakery area near gas line, be-
hind the large_ oven, in soda syrup near ofﬁce,
under fruit storage shelf and near dish room
back entrance.” _

SGB trains Pitt Day participcmtsto lobby legislators

By Parthena Moisiadis
Staﬁ” Writer

Two Pitt administrators assumed the
roles of a student and a state legislator
Tuesday.

“Good afternoon, Senator. Nice to meet
you. I’m a voter in your district and I’d
really like to talk to you about funding

for Pitt,” said Charles McLaughlin, Pitt’s ,

director of commonwealth relations.
“State funds keep our tuition low, and
that’s why we’re here today — to ask to
stop cuts to Pitt.”

The “legislator” responded: e

“We have no choice. We have to spend
money on prisons and publicwelfare. You
are bright kids, but it’s going to be tough

-to ﬁnd money to put in the budget,” said‘ A .
Paul Supowitz, Pitt’s vice chancellor for“

governmental relations. ‘
The role—playing dialogue was a model

for a training session held by Pitt’s Student ‘

Government Board and the Community
and Governmental Relations office to prep

, students for Pitt Day in Harrisburg. On

March 13, Pitt students will talk to legis-
lators at the state capital to protest Gov.
Tom Corbett’s proposed budget, which
would cut Pitt’s funding by 30 percent.

“This year it is vitally important to
send out the message that cuts need to
stop and reductions need to end,” SGB
President James Landreneau said.

Although more than 170 students have
registered for Pitt Day in Harrisburg so far,
only about 15 students attended the one-
hour session in the William Pitt Union.

“It’s a tough week. It’s right before
Spring Break,” Supowitz said, referring
to the training session’s attendance.

Participants who did not attend the
training will watch a recording of the
meeting that will play on the buses as
Pitt students make the three-and-a-half-
hour trek east. ,

Landreneau said that the training
session provided students with an op-
portunity to learn about the process of
lobbying and talking to a senator. There
will be another training session on Thurs-
day from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. in the William
Pitt Union. A

“It will help them approach the situa-
tion head—on,” he said. p

- Supowitz said that students should be
respectful yet direct when speaking with
legislators — he advised the soon-to-be
lobbyists to “look [legislators] straight
in the eye.”

“Tell them that Pitt is a top research
institution and that we need to keep it
public,” Supowitz said.

McLaughlin added to the advice, saying
that students should not be nervous about
memorizing facts and figures.

“Speak from the heart,” he said. “It’s
the personal stories that work. You have
to remember that legislators are regular

people like your mom or dad.”

Last year, Corbett proposed cutting
funding to the four state~related universi-
ties by 50 percent, and the budget passed
with a 19 percent cut to state funding.

Landreneau said that he hopes students
will continue to register for Pitt Day in
Harrisburg so that the numbers reach last
year’s attendanceof 200 students. Online
registration ends Thursday.

Supowitz said that students should plan
to speak with Republican legislators, as
they hold the majority in both the House
of Representatives and the Senate. “

“You have
to remember that
legislators are regular
people like your
mom or dad

—Charles McLaughlin

“The proposal is in the hands of the leg— .

islators. The Republican administration is
in control. Those are our targets. It is vital
to see these Republican legislators, as they
will control the process,” he said.

McLaughlin said that legislators ap-
preciate student input in the legislative
process.

“We always get tremendous feedback,”
he said. “Students are always respectful
and knowledgeable. The training helps,
but it really speaks to the caliber of the

students.” I

report also stated that an exterminator was on
site during the assessment and that he would
be on the premises every day until the problem
was rectiﬁed. When the health department re-
turned on Oct 19, the pest control was marked
as “satisfactory.”

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Pretend you look hot for Spring Break

By Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

Mark your calendars, broskerinos and du-
dettes: Spring Break hits on March
2, and it’s going to hit harder than
the cumulative impact of 1,000
back—to-back—to-back “American
Idol” auditions. But you needn’t
fear: After spending the next
700 advice-laden words with
us, you’ll be able to strike back
with equal intensity.

Before we go any ﬁirther, walk k
over to the nearest mirror, strip out
of your loose sweats and assess the damage.
Given that you haven’t worn anything more
revealing than an XXL ﬂeece since the begin-
ning of October, you’re probably in store for a
shock. Given that a freshman 50’s worth of pal-
lid, pizza-padded ﬂesh awaits your inspection,
don’t be afraid to keep a barf bag at the ready.

Once you’ve determined that you look like a
total wreck, it’s time to make some changes. You’ll
never cut the mustard, much less the ketchup, ii
you stroll onto the beach with this kind of pa-
thetic physique as your calling card. On top 01
that, it’s downright dangerous: The local bullies
and toughs -—— of whom there are hundreds
and perhaps even thousands at these resorts,

the way. Within a few minutes, you’re going to be pour-
ing gallons of Coronas down your gullet —— go hard
or go home, right? — and your gut will quickly have
expanded to its previous dimensions.

In order to get around this problem, hurry

'0 the beach and have your bros snap a bunch

of pics of you gooﬁng around and

_ooking cool while you’re secretly
tensing every available muscle in
your body. Have them shoot you above
the waist, so that the “viewers at home”
won’t be able to tell that you’re using
me of your hands to pull down the
ﬂab on your stomach so as to create
. ':he illusion of a striated six-pack of
lean muscle.
If you want to mix things up, re-
member to wear a second bathing suit
under your ﬁrst one. After the requisite
300 pics have been snapped of you in
your ﬁrst one, change into that sec-
ond suit. Accessorize your new look
i with stylin’ items such as a gold chain, a
ﬂat-brimmed hat and a clip—on “diamond” earring
ind there’ll be no way to tell that these pictures
‘veren’t taken much later in the trip.

As far as the remainder of the trip goes, you’ll
want to “check in” with your BFFs at as many
happening locations as you possibly can. Even

'fyou’re not anywhere near these locations (or
on Spring Break at all, for that matter), you
can search for them on your social

you and proceed to kick piles of sand

An easy ﬁrst step toward developing the body of
your friends’ dreams consists of nothing more (and
nothing less) than coating yourself from head to toe in
spray tanning solution. Once you’re roughly the color
of a dark clementine or a pastel eggplant, you’ll look at
least 50 times better than you once did —— and maybe
a hundred if you can convince one of your closest bros
to draw an “ab deck” on that spare tire of yours.

Next, get your hair highlighted. Few things draw
attention to the natural color of your hair quite like a
phat set of frosted tips. “Wow,” people will say when

they catch sight of your new ’do, “If only the rest of his

hair were as awesome as those frosted tips.” Bear in
mind that all of this is absolutely necessary: Without
a completely new look, there would be little point in
crashing the beach and taking a whole bunch of envy-
inducing Facebook photos.

And that’s what this is all about, isn’t it? The rest
of your preparations —— selecting a glamorous des-
tination, picking out the most form—ﬁtting “banana
hammock” of a unisex thong you can ﬁnd at American
Apparel, taking out a few unsubsidized private student
loans at a crushing 11.8 percent interest rate to afford
this “booze cruise” 4- all pale in signiﬁcance to the
thorough documentation of this blessed event through
social media that will occur once you arrive. .

As soon as you reach the hotel you’ll be staying
at, you can’t hesitate for so much as a split freakin’
second in terms of getting those shirtless pics out of

carry on as if you’ve been having the
time of your life. For example:

Once your ‘reputation as a debauchee nonpareil
is ﬁrmly established via a stream of posts about how
super cool the cool things you’ve been doing are, you
can rest on your laurels. In fact, we’d recommend
that you sleep through the remainder of the vacation,
thereby conserving your energy for your long—awaited
homecoming. When you return to the ’Burgh — a place
where it’s always overcast with 500 percent humid-

virulent strain of walking pneumonia —— you can slip
back into your loose sweats, order a couple of $5 pizza
pies, ﬁre up your iPad and start ﬂipping through the
public record of how much fun you just had.

They’re the Pitt students you
see chasing rebounds in dress
clothes on the Petersen Events
Center floor prior to Pitt men’s
basketball games.

Decked out in suits and
ties, they toss the ball to Ash-
ton Gibbs, Travon Woodall and
the rest ofthe men’s basketball
team, helping the Panthers
warm up before the buzzer
sounds. Come game time, they
retreat to the bench, settle in
and watch the action, occa-
sionally filling a water bottle
or tossing a towel to one of the
players. .

But the student managers are
a bigger part of the team and
have a lot more responsibility

seven managers — Matt Falcon,
Brendan Kozlowski, Rob Briggs,
Ben Blount, Seth Friedman,
Jonathon Brodack and Michael

by Director of Men’s Basketball
Operations Brian Regan and at-

Though they don’t get paid
for their efforts or receive any
type of college credit, manag-

money. A select few also travel
with the team to away contests,
a privilege usually reserved for
the elders in the group.

Road trips and up-close-and-
personal seats at the Petersen
Events Center are undoubtedly
two big perks of the position,
but the managers perform their
fair share of humble tasks as

“They’re the ones that are

“When the players come
early, they’re rebounding for
the players. Ifthe coaches need
something, they’re taking care

Panthers to face St. ‘
Iohn’s in season’s last

home game

Nate Barnes
Staﬁwri ter

Last season, both Pitt and St.J0hn’s '

ﬁnished near the top of the Big

East standings and qualiﬁed for

the NCAA Tournament. This year,
neither team will reach .500 in Big
East play.

When the Panthers (15-14, 4-12
Big East) face the Red Storm (13-
16, 6-10 Big East) at the Petersen
Events Center tonight, it won’t be
for NCAA Tournament seeding.
Instead, both schools’s only chance
at making the NCAA Tournament
and avoiding the consolation prize
of an appearance in the National
Invitation Tournament will be a
win at the Big

guard from Missouri City, Texas,
leads the Red Storm in scoring,
posting 16.8 points per game. Har-
rison presents a big challenge for
Pitt defensively as the Panthers
have struggled with proliﬁc perim-
eter scorers this season.

unit for St. John’s. Harkless pulls
down a team-high 8.7 rebounds
per game and ranks second on the
team in scoring with 15.6 points
per contest.

“Moe is the best player in New
York City,” St. john’s head coach
Steve Lavin said last year when
Harkless committed to St.]ohn’s.

Notre Dame, St. John’s looks to

recently resulted in a three-game
win streak for interim head coach
Mike Dunlap and his players.

“We’re just growing every day,

Red Storm freshman Moe Hark-

Notre Dame. “Earlier in the year we
had trouble closing out games. As
of late, we’ve been doing a better

up and handing it out to the other coach-

es. He also helps the assistant coaches

start some pre-practice drills and skill
- work for the players. a

“I like to think we do all the little
things so that, for the coaches and the
players,’ the only thing they have to worry
about is basketball,” Falcon said. “That’s
the biggest part of ourjob, just being ac-
cessible and being ready to work hard so
we can help [the players] get better.”

Coming to practice each day with his
proverbial lunchpail is an obligation
that Falcon knows not to take lightly.
Like most managers, Falcon started out
as an assistant to the video coordinator
— a position even more unsung than his
current one — after he went through
an interview process with Regan as a
freshman.

And for as much as the managers con-
tribute to the Pitt basketball program,
they get a lot out of the experience as
well.

“I personally would like to coach
one day,” Friedman, a sophomore, said.
“I don’t know about all of the other
managers, but a lot of us are thinking
about [coaching], so this is a good first
step.”

For Friedman and his fellow coaching
hopefuls, studying Dixon during games
and in practice every day is an invalu-
able asset.

“It’s really interesting getting to watch
all of his mannerisms, how he handles
different situations, how he handles him-
self in timeouts throughout the game
and in practice,” Friedman said. “To be
able to see him every day and work with
him and the rest of the coaches and the

players is an .in-credible experience and
definitely a learning experience.”

Like Friedman, fellow sophomore Lin-
denbaum also hopes to forge a career in

‘coaching.’ Butthat wasn’t the only reason

why he decided tobecome a manager.

“I missed high school basketball,”
Lindenbaum said. “I got to college, and
there was just something missing. Even
though I’m not playing, itjust feels like
I’m part ofa team. So that’s really why I
decided to get into it.”

Briggs, a junior, took a different
route to end up in the same position as
Friedman, Lindenbaum and the other
managers. Just last year, he was playing
basketball at Westminster College, a Di-
vision III school about an hour north of
Pittsburgh in New Wilmington, Pa.

After spending three years at West-
minster as an engineering student, Briggs
transferred to Pitt over the summer and
will spend the remainder of this year
ﬁnishing his five-year degree program.
He said that the decision to experience
Division I hoops in the meantime was a
no-brainer.

“When I got here I knew I didn’t really
want to stop being involved in college
basketball, so I got a hold of my coach
[at Westminster], and he talked to Coach
Regan down here andjust kind of passed
my name around,” Briggs said. “I love
it. I enjoy it because I’m still in basket-
ball, and I knew I didn’t want to give it
up. So this is kind of my chance to keep
playing college basketball, I guess you
could say.” _

Despite Briggs’ prowess on the court-,
the managers’ skill didn’t translate to

a victory when the managers faced off
against their counterparts from West
Virginia earlier this month. Before
the Panthers and Mountaineers went
head-to-head both in Morgantown and
in Pittsburgh, the managers from the
schools played each other for nothing
more than bragging rights. Call it the
Backyard Brawl Lite.

“The results weren’t so great, but it
was definitely a cool experience playing
them,” Friedman said. But he was also
quick to point out that the Mountaineer
managers might have benefitted from
suiting up a well-traveled ringer.

“They had their video coordinator
playing, who’s 31 and walked—on to Kan-

sas State, so they had quite an advan-
tage,” he said.

With the Mountaineers moving to
the Big 12 conference, the Pitt manag-
ers might not get a chance to settle the
score with their West Virginia rivals next
season, but Regan said their contribu-
tions to the real Panthers team cannot
be overlooked.

“They know all of our drills, all of
our skill work and situations that we

run, and they make sure things in prac-

tice go off without a hitch,” Regan said.
“They’re very important, and the things
that they do and the things that they
bring to the table are a very integral part
of our success.” i

committed six turnovers.

“There’s been times when he’s trying to I

do too much,” Dixon said. “There’s been
some situations where we’ve forced some
things.”

The guard play between Woodall and
Gibbs has been lacking during the ﬁve-
game losing streak. Gibbs, who averages
15.4 points on the season, has put up just 8.8
points per game while shooting 30.7 percent.
He also hasn’t made a 3-point shot in the last
three games.

keeping the game close, the Panthers couldn’t

chances at pulling out a victory.
