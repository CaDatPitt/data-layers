Pitt’s transgender policy conflicts with city, county policies

By Em Maier
Staff Writer

The director of the Pittsburgh
Commission on Human Relations
said Pitt’s transgender policy is
“very concerning.”

Charles Morrison, the direc-
tor of the commission that Pitts-
burgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl ap-
pointed, studies and investigates
complaints of allegeddiscrimina—
tion in employment, housing and
public accommodations within

the city limits. His commission
has the power to issue subpoenas
to aid investigations and hearings
on any policy that discriminates
against a person for things such
as sex and sexual orientation. ‘

“According to the city code,
‘Sex is the gender of a person, as
perceived, presumed or assumed
by others, including those who
are changing or have changed
their gender identiﬁcation,”’
Morrison said. “From what it
sounds like, the University is not
in accord with [the code] .”

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill
said in a statement that “The Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh will not dis-
criminate on the basis of gender
identity and expression.”

He said that transgender stu-
dents must use the facilities that
match the sex on their birth cer-
tiﬁcates.

“This does not represent a
change in policy; rather, it is an
articulation of a long—standing
University practice concerning
the use of restroom and locker
room facilities,” he said. ’

The office of the University
General Counsel declined to com-
ment on the issue.

At a March 20 meeting of the
Anti-Discriminatory Policies
Committee —— oneof the stand-

-ing committees of the University
0 Senate — a Pitt representative

delivered news of the new stan-
dard concerning transgender
students.

Sources present at the meet-
ing said the representative,‘who

the Pitt administration declined

to identify, announced that stu-

dents would have to use public
gend_ered‘facilities, such as bath-
rooms, that align with the sex
listed on their birth certiﬁcates.

But in some states, it is impos-
sible to change the sex on a birth
certiﬁcate, and in Pennsylvania
a transgender person must ﬁrst
have sex-reassignment surgery
before the state will alter a birth
certiﬁcate.

threats multiply

By Mallory Grossman
and Andrew Shull
The Pitt News Staff

After the eighth and ninth bomb
threats of the semester occurred
on Monday, Pitt raised the reward
for information on the perpetrator
to $50,000.

After the threat to the Cathe-
dral of Learning had been received

Monday, Pitt posted a message on

the my.pitt homepage notifying
students of the increased reward
for anyone who has information
about the actor responsible for
the threats. Pitt originally posted
a notice offering a $10,000 reward
on the homepage on Friday.

The University sent out an
Emergency Notiﬁcation System
message at 3:30 p.m. alerting the
campus to the threat at David Law-
rence Hall and advising everyone
to evacuate the building. The threat
concluded about an hour later.

At 5:30 p.m., Pitt sent out an-
other'ENS alert, this time for a
bomb threat at the Cathedral of
Learning. An ENS alert concluded

the disturbance and reopened the
building at 6:45 p.m. This marks
the —sixth bomb threat the Cathe-
dral has received this semester.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill
would not comment on whether
the threats on Monday were related
to the previous ones or on how po-
lice received them. He said he could
only reiterate the ENS message.

Garth Porter, a senior econom-
ics major, had aweek of class wiped
out by the threats at the Cathedral
of Learning.

He said that he didn’t tell his
roommate that he hoped his night
class wouldn’t be canceled by a
threat because he “didn’t want to
jinx it.” .

“But alas, we’re here,” he said,
standing outside of the evacuated
Cathedral.

C Porter said that he checked his
phone before parking in Soldiers
8: Sailors Garage and only learned

of the threat after he parked — -

bad timing that he said would cost
him $5. '

Vice Provost and Dean of Stu-
dents Kathy Humphrey outlined
the measures that Pitt is taking to

ﬁnd the actor in an email sent out
to students Friday. A’

These measures include in-
creased security guard coverage,
reviewing video footage of en-
trances to various locations, re-
viewing ﬁngerprint evidence and
working with the FBI to utilize its
resources and manpower.

. The email also said that Pitt

_ has hired a handwriting expert to
A evaluate the messages written by
_ the actor, all of which were found

on bathroom stalls.
Lingering Alarm

After the ENS alert went out
declaring the threat at the Cathe-
dral over at 6:45 p.m., the lights
in the building continued ﬂash-
ing. Around 6:50 p.m., the alarms
sounded again, setting off another

' evacuation. By 7 p.m., the alarms

were silent, and people starting
ﬁling back inside the building.

Hill did not have any further
information on the subsequent
alarm. I

Union goes ay
without water

- By Mallory Grossman A
News Editor

A  The William Pitt Union went without water

Sunday night through Monday because ofa

water leak at the Carnegie Museum.
Melissa Rubin, a spokeswoman for

the Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Author-

‘ . ity, said the‘museurn’s six-inch ﬁreline is
" owned by a private contractor. In order for

the contractor to ﬁx the leak, PWSA had to
shut off its own six-inch line, which sup-
plies water tothe Union.

Rubin said PWSA hadno control over
the repair time but estimated that the wa-
ter should be back on in the Union by 5:30
p.m. on Monday. She was not available for
comment after that, and as of press time,
the water still was not working in the

Union.

frequently aligns with one’s natal sex —
Pittsburgh and Allegheny County consider
sex to be one’s gender as perceived by oth-
ers.

Morrison said that his commission typ-
ically acts only upon receiving report of a
concern stating that an organization or,in-
stitutional policy has acted in a damaging
or hurtful way. From there, the committee
launches an investigation to determine the
validity of the complaint and closely ex-
amines the wording and implementation
of the questioned policy.

Morrison said that conciliation is the '

initial goal, but litigation often occurs,

A creating another set of complexities. As of

Monday afternoon, no one had lodged any
complaints to the commission about Pitt’s
policy, and the commission does not cur-
rently have plans to launch an investiga-
tion into the transgender policy.

‘The commission can initiate its own
action, but it’s best if we have a victim, so
to speak,” Morrison said, adding that a re-
port can act as a “trigger” for the human

relations commission to pursue a remedy

have comparable concepts of gender, using
identiﬁed gender rather than natal sex.

“The city and the county have similar
deﬁnitions, while the state does not. The
state just says if you’re male or female,
that’s all.” Morrison said.

Shannon Powers, from the Pennsylva-
nia Human Relations Commission, said
that the state’s Human Relations Act pro-
hibits discrimination based on sex. How-
ever, the state does not deﬁne what consti-
tutes sex or gender. .

“[The Act] does not deﬁne. sex ﬁirther,
not in terms of, ‘Is it biological sex as-
signed at birth?’ or another deﬁnition. It
doesn’t go into speciﬁcs,” Powers said.

Powers elaborated, explaining that the
term has never needed to be deﬁned be-

   
   

 

  

 

fore.

“There have not been any complaints
based on sex involving transgendered indi-
viduals that ever got to a public hearing or
court decision —— so there’s no precedent
for deﬁning sex. We’ve had complaints
ﬁled discussing discrimination, but noth-
ing that has gotten to the public hearing
phase,” she said.

Before Pitt’s new decision, the choice
of restroom use was up to the students —
they were allowed to use restrooms based
on the gender with which they identiﬁed.

Student Government Board m_ember_]u-
lie Hallinan said that she wanted to stress
how imperative itis for Pitt to make sure-its
policies are in line with city ordinances.-'f,_ .

that the University should be held account-

Adam Dobson, vice president of Pitt’s
Rainbow Alliance, voiced similar frustra-
tion. He said that the nondiscrimination
policy used to be designed to protect stu-
dents, but it no’ longer serves that pur-
pose. ' a

“What I would like is if Pitt would ap-
propriately implement its nondiscrimi-

its students rather than fear of legal con-
sequences,” Dobson said, adding that he
doesn’t want Pitt to change its policy just
to comply with a city ordinance.

Doing yearly taxes an inevitable,

verbose, severelymunaane reality

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

What makes this time of year so anti-charming is
that one speciﬁc tiding it brings is inevitable and
predictable. _ .
That inevitable tiding is, in a way, worse than
death: We know that death comes to us all, but it
is interesting and exciting in that we’re never quite
sure when it will occur. Brushing against it can be

thrilling and as easy as jaywalking. And, of course,

death, occurs only
once. Yet what we do
at this time of year
comes every year,
twinned with death
in its certainty.

I refer, of course,
to taxes.

Now taxes by
themselves are the
annoying price we
pay for civilization.
Indeed, the marker
of civilization is that
a_society has taxes
where a pre-civiliza-
tion had extortion.
Throughout history,
people have disliked
paying taxes to the
point of , taking up
arms against the
government. I really
don’t think anybody
actually enjoys pay-
ing taxestany more
than they enjoy paying to get their cavities ﬁlled.

MCT Campus

, It’s unpleasant, but we need to do it.

I see_why taxes are necessary. They pave the
roads,_ sort"of. They keep our army maintained so
the Canadians don’t get any, ideas. They provide
servicesto the needy. They build random bridges
in Alaska that nobody uses. While there’s both
pork and baloney in the federal budget, one man’s
baloney is another’s graduate student stipend. I

won’t complain too much aboutthe money itself. ,

I will complain about the time it takes me to do
all this stuff. The Folger Shakespeare Library es-
timates that the complete works of Shakespeare
contain 884,647 words. In contrast, the U.S. tax
code contains 3.8 million words, according to
The Economist, with none of it written in iambic
pentameter or speaking to the human condition
— though I’m sure the code talks about falconry
somewhere. The IRS estimates that tax compli-
ance takes up 6.1 billion man-hours every year,
or 3 million people working full time, year-round,
just on. taxes. That’sabout as many people as the
entire civilian federal workforce or the entire De-

partment of Defense. That’s a lot of time that could
probably be better spent elsewhere.

It’s also a lot of aggravation or expense — or
both —— to do your taxes. At 16, I tried to ﬁle my
taxes using pencil, paper and an instruction book-
let. Accounting for three sources of income, the
task took me about three hours. Accompanying
this inconvenience was the realization that if I
screwed up and got caught, in theory, I would be
liable for perjury. This is spooky, so 60 percent of
Americans pay to have their taxes done, with an-
other 29 percent shelling out for‘software.

Aside from the lost time, there are other real
'  l l costs to having a
complicated tax code
and ﬁling system.
First, the IRS has to
catch those people
who are either mis-
taken or dishonest
in their tax ﬁlings,
which takes a lot of
time. Second, all this
complexity makes it
easier to hide amidst
the many exemp-
-tions and loopholes
of the tax code, con-
- sidering you are able
to afford somebody
who will ﬁnd those

This is howsome bil-
lionaires are able to
pay taxes at a rate of
17 percent while not
reporting some of
their income as, well,
' . ’ income. Even War-
ren Buffett, he of the Buffett Rule, is able to exploit
loopholes to pay less and completely avoid the Al-
ternative Minimum Tax, a tax speciﬁcally targeted
at the rich in the ﬁrst place. Third, there are parts
of the tax code that simply make no sense, such as
how interest on Treasury bonds is taxed at normal
rates whereas municipal bonds are tax-exempt.
There is_ a serious need for tax simpliﬁcation,

something which is felt on both the "left and the .

right. Herman Cain had a big surge in the polls be-
fore he demonstrated he wasn’t sure where Libya
was, and the big reason was the 9-9-9 plan. Of
course, a lot of people thought that it wasn’t really
workable, that it was regressive and that he got the
idea from playing SimCity. But what made the plan
appealing was its simplicity: Attach documenta-
tion of everything that you made this year, send
us 9 percent, thank you. When you goto the store:
your total is $5. With 9 percent federal sales tax,
that’s $5.45. Have a nice day. "A

Evenif it’s warm, dress conservatively for class  

By Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

When the weather makes it feel
like summer in the middle of
March, it is tempting to break
out the summer wardrobe —— in
the middle of March -—- and walk

around like you’re on the beach ,

 even though it’s the middle of

March. '

While I love the warm weather
as much ‘as the next person and
am excited for my spring ward-

robe, I’ve also been horriﬁed at

some of the outﬁts I’ve seen on

' my classmates as they stroll into

class. From spandex shorts to
revealing tank tops, I think that

‘ students should take a little more

care in what they’re wearing to
class, despite the weather. _

I’ve written before about
dressing up for class rather than

dressing down, but this is another l

problem entirely. I can’t tell you
what you can or cannot wear, but
I feel strongly that, when dealing

April 8, 2012 | The Pitt News 1 wx/vx/v.pittrievvs.com

with professors and colleaguesin
a classroom setting, there is an
air of professionalism that needs
to be maintained.

As students, our futures are
completely blank, whether we
think they are or not. We never
know when we’re going to need

. that one professor’s recommen-

dation or when that guy we’re sit-
ting next to might be the key to
getting a job. When surrounded

by people who have the potential »
— to be the turning points to our fu-

tures, there is no knowing when

‘ we will need to make sure our

ﬁrst impression will count.
To remain professional, dress-
ing not only well, but appropri-

ately, is important. You can’t as- I

sume what the other -person is
going to think of you, so it’sbet—

ter to err on the .side of caution.

anddress a little more conser-
vatively for class. You can never
know when that one person in
your class who" yo’u”'tl'iink’ is too
conservative might be the one to
help your future the most.

Ifprofessionalismisn’t enough
of a reason, there’s a much more
practical reason to keep things
covered: air conditioning. We live

‘A in the.21st century and attend a_
University that provides these

services for us on a daily basis.
Every academic building is air
conditioned, and, while some are
warmer than others, all are cool-
er than the warm weather.
Practically speaking, it is
not worthwhile to dress in your
skimpiest outﬁts when you’re go-
ing. to class. Inevitably, ‘you are
going to get cold in your class-
room and complain to the person

' sitting next to you about how cold
‘ you are. Don’t forget that that

person could be the key to your
future. You don’t want to be seen
as a complainer. _
While it’s warm outside, it’s
cold in the buildings on campus
where you’re likely spending
the majority of your days. Wear-
ing more substantial clothing is

the easiest and best way to stay A

warmer during class.

The biggest reason to dress

- appropriately for class is to avoid

distraction. Let’s be honest here.
Guys, I know you love summer
weather for the short skirts, spa-
ghetti straps and low- cut blouses.
But when youire in class, the goal
is to learn, not to get the number
of that hot chick sitting across
the room. '

And girls, respect your peers
and help to keep their wandering
eyes at bay. You don’t need to be
showing off for that cute guy sit-
ting behind you during class any
more than he needs to be watch-
ing you. This is not to say you can’t
make friends in your classes; just
be aware that you might be caus-
ing someone else to be distracted
from work.

' Guys and girls, be aware that
the classroom is a place of learn-
ing. As soon as you step over the
threshold of a classroom door,
you are free to do as you please,
but you’re in college to get an ed-
ucation ﬁrst and foremost. Don’t
take that for granted.

Now, I do realize that lately it’s
been more than Boidegrees out-
side, and sometimes it’s just un-
bearable to wear anything more
than the minimum. But there are
ways around that too. Try bring-
ing a sweater to class to keep
warm and hide some skin. Then
you can easily take it off once
you’re outside. Also, sundresses
are a great summer alternative to
skimpy shorts. They’re light and
breezy in the warm weather, but
they also look nice for class. There
are easy ways around dressing in-

_ appropriately for class.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t
wear shorts, but maybe spandex

- shorts that only Olympic run-
'ners wear aren’t the best idea. I’m

not saying you shouldn’t wear a

_ sleeveless shirt, but if, when you

lean across your desk, you put on
a show, maybe it’s not the best
idea. For the sake of your future,
your education and a steady body
temperature: Cover up. I '

Unfortunately, although a gen-

’ eral agreement about the tax code

is in place on the left and the right,
there is no speciﬁc agreement.
There are also very strong vested
interests in keeping the tax code
exactly the way it currently is. For
one thing, those with money want
loopholes in which to hide it, and
every interest group is interested
in a particular setof exemptions.
For ‘another, tax preparers are
not at all interested in everybody
being able to do their own taxes

with a pencil and paper. This isn’t
because they’re evil; it’s because
they want ‘to have jobs. Most
taxpayers accept irritation at tax
time as inevitable and don’t really
make noise about it.

So while there is a very real
need for tax simpliﬁcation, the
sad truth is that we are just going
to have to accept the complex-
ity. If only people would demand
comprehensive tax reform, or if

. Hollywood could atleast make

taxes as exciting as death is on
the silver screen. I

J.D. Schroeder, vice president of
the Oakland Zoo, strolls into the
lobby of the Petersen Events Cen—‘
ter and holds up his ink-stained
hands. He smiles as he rubs them
together in an attempt to rid them
of the black stain.

“We’re papering the whole
Pete,” he explains. “Everyone’s
hands look a lot like this.”

He gives up trying to clean off
his hands as he walks through the
lobby of Pitt’s on-campus basket—
ball arena to an elevator that will
take him back to the basketball
ﬂoor. There’s still mo re than three
hours before the Pitt men’s basket—

April 8, 2012 l The Pitt News I vvvvvv.ptttnevvs.com

ball game against South Florida
will begin, but the arena is already
ﬁlling up with about 30 members
of Pitt’s student section, the Oak-
land Zoo. The students are working
to place custom—made newspapers
over each of the more than 12,000
seats inside the arena.

The leaders usually just place
newspapers in the 1,100—seat stu-
dent section but, in honor of senior
night, newspapers with the faces
of honorees Ashton Gibbs and
Nasir Robinson have been spread
throughout the arena.

Since its inception in the winter
of 2001, the Oakland Zoo has be-
come one of the most recognizable
and praised student sections in the
country. The Zoo has been featured
in the Wall Streetjournal and this

season, ESPN’s Eamonn Brennan
and Dana O’Neil selected the Zoo as

the nation’s No. 2 student section a

behind Duke’s Cameron Crazies.

“It’s always fun,” O’Neil said
about the Petersen Events Center
in a podcast. “There’s always huge
energy in there  [The Zoo] takes
it very seriously and I do think they
make a difference having talked to
players and stuff there.”

Brennan noted the adoption be-
tween the program and the student
section, citing the Oakland Zoo
logo on the back of Pitt’s jerseys
and team members warming up in
Zoo T—shirts before the game.

, “They’re one and the same at
this point,” Brennan said in the
podcast. “That’s really impressive
to me.”

Preparation
The newspapers contain ros-

ters for both teams, and students

hold them up during the oppos-'
ing team’s introduction so that the
“Let’s Go Pitt” printed on the back
is clearly visible.

The six Oakland Zoo leaders —
Schroeder, President Eric Hayba-
rger, Vice Presidentjoe Lassi,]or—
dan Shoup,‘Mike Tam and Cortney
Spertzel - normally take care of
papering the student section, but
Schroeder and the rest of the Zoo
leaders brought friends and loyal
members of the student section as

’ reinforcements to help with the

increased responsibility for the
South Florida game.

Onfnormal nights, Zoo lead-
ers arrive at 3:30 p.m. for a7 p.m.

leading the Zoo

Even during a tough season, the Oakland Zooremains a fierce crowd at games

game in order to handle pregame
responsibilities. It usually takes
30-45 minutes to place newspapers
on the student section seats. But
with more than 11,000 extra seats
to decorate, Zoo members arrived
an hour earlier for the February
game against South Florida. The
students work efficiently and, by
3:30 p.m., they are ahead of sched-
ule.

They’ve already papered the en-
tire arena — save a few seats in the
top rows — and Schroeder sits in
the front of the student section to
look around at the dark blue seats
plastered with gray newspapers.

members are already relaxing in

the ﬁrst few rows of the student section,

’ spreading homework and books across their
. p ‘ laps to study until it gets closer to the start
' of the game or pizza arrives. ‘

n The Zoo leaders’ pregame routine doesn’t
end with preparing the student section.
Schroeder said that before every game, the
leaders have to ﬁnd out how many students

V will be arriving, how many newspapers to

lay out and any information they need to
know about the players or events of the day,
Sometimes, the leaders will use computers
to look up information on opposing players
that they incorporate into chants or to write
on the Whiteboards they hold up from the

front row. ‘

V They watch the players warm up hours
before tipoff and often take atrip to the line
of students that forms in the lobby before

games to see if their classmates have any

questions. .

Adversity

The lines in the Petersen Events Center
were slightly shorter this season and for
the game against South Florida, just four
sections of the Oakland Zoo were ﬁlled. The
men’s basketball team —— which had‘ strung
together a decade ﬁlled with 20-win sea-
sons and Big East Championships — limped
through this season. -_

After starting the season 11-1, the Pan-
thers "dropped seven straight games in the

,_ ,_.,.,-........_- —-

Big East. Although the team looked like it
was getting back on track with four consecu-
tive wins after the return of injured point
guard Tray Woodall, Pitt would lose to South
Florida for the second time this season and
then lose three out of its ﬁnal four games.

The Panthers won a single game in the
Big East Tournament and then, on Selection
Sunday, when they are normally waiting to
ﬁnd out their seeding for the NCAA Tourna-
ment, the team wasn’t even given a bid to the
National Invitation Tournament.

Instead, Pitt played in the College Basket-
ball Invitational, a 16-team post-season tour-
nament. The Panthers hosted four games at
the Petersen Events Center in front of less
than 4,000 fans and about 60 students for
each game.

“We thought morestudents and fans
would come out to support the team,”
Schroeder said. “But there seemed to be
an underlying feeling of dislike that people
wereeven in the tournament.” _

But Schroeder said that all of the Zoo
leaders would agree that the games were

‘ “as much fun as any game at'the ‘Pete this

year, if not more.” _

“I’m not sure if it was because it was
mostly diehards, but I know the Zoo had
more fun heckling, making jokes, laugh-
ing,” he said.. “It was just simply a fun and
laid-back atmosphere.”

And when Pitt won the CBI championship
over Washington State on Friday, sophomore
team memberJ.]. Moore ran the CBI banner
over to the Oakland Zoo in celebration.

Schroeder said that Pitt gained experi-
ence in the close games, such as an over-
time semiﬁnal game with Butler, and also
showed who will be at the core of the team
next season. I I

The students ﬁlled the Zoo for the contest
before South Florida — a game against rival
West Virginia. The members of the student
section cheered and bounced with so much
pregame energy that the lower bowl of the
arena shook. But as the Mountaineers pulled
away in the second half, the student section’s
energy began to fade. _

“It’s hard to get people motivated,”
Schroeder said. “When you have a top—ﬁve
team coming to the Pete, we really don’t
need to do much. When teams like Provi-

' - dence come in, it’s really hard to get students

motivated.” I

“The Zoo is deﬁnitely something I know
people ﬁnd one of the most enjoyable parts
about the University. That’s one of the best

‘ things to come out of Twitter, just to be able
to talk to so many people at once.”

Not every student who enters the Pe-
tersen Events Center is as passionate as the
leaders, but D. Randall Smith, an associate
professor of sports sociology at Rutgers
University, said that some students in the
Zoo will come to games just for the social
aspect. I 1

“One of the sociological perspectives on
college sports is‘ that they facilitate social
integration and school spirit,” Smith said
in an email.

The Oakland Zoo ‘has more than 7,300

Twitter followers and is the largest known
student section account. Purdue’s student
section, the Paint Crew, ranks second with
roughly 6,300 followers. Schroeder, who
handles 90 percent of the account’s tweets,
said that the Zoo account was run by a for-
mer leader until Pitt’s loss in the NCAA Tour-
nament last year. The day after the Panthers’
loss to Butler, the account added more than
2,700’ followers. ’

Schroeder uses the account to boost mo-
rale, encourage students to attend games
and even send out information on the op-

posing teams and players. ‘

“It’s gotten to the point where Eric [Hay-
barger] and I can’t check our phones dur-
ing games because the Zoo’s Twitter keeps
blowing up,” Schroeder said.‘ “Two or three
people are tagging us a minute saying things
like we sound awesome on television.”

' Although the Zoo has failed to ﬁll the
section for every Big East game this season,
the student section reached over 90 percent
capacity for several» games, including West
Virginia, Georgetown and Villanova. But
attendance fell off noticeably against South

, Florida.

Smith said some studies show that fans
tend to identify with their team more when
it wins.

“You can see this on campus when stu-
dents are more likely to wear school colors
(T-shirts, sweats, baseball caps and so forth)
after a ‘big’ win,” Smith said in an email.

  Asbestos leaves historic
building abandoned but intact

By Anna Weldon
Senior Staﬂ" Writer

’ Like abig, white elephant, the old Schenley High

School continues to inhabit North Oakland,
despite its desertion. .

The old school sits abandoned on Bigelow
Boulevard, up the hill from the Cathedral of
Learning. For years, the building has been cel-
ebrated for its design, but itremains unused
since 2008 because of asbestos problems.

Because the building is designated a land-
mark, it cannot be torn down —— and the Pitts-
burgh Public School District cannot afford to
ﬁx it. The building, which sits on a hill, acts as
a prominent and visible symbol of education
in the community. - V ‘

“Itwas intended to be a showcase for educa-
tion. It was a magnet for students around the
city,” said Drew Armstrong, the director of the
architectural studies program at Pitt.

The latest plan — converting the space for
residential use — was rejected by the school
district’s board. The future of the building now
hangs in limbo. A

School History

The building, constructed by Pittsburgh
architect Edward Stotz in 1915 and 1916, was
considered state—of—the-art in its design.

Because itwas builtinthe early 20th century,

the building has multiple layers of signiﬁcance. ‘

The quality, location, recognition and archi-
tecture of the building are several aspects that
contribute to its importance, said Albert Tann-
ler, the Historical Collections director at the
Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation.

Armstrong explained the strategic loca-
tion of Schenley High School. Located in the
Schenley Farms Historic District, it has an elite
position in the neighborhood. . .

When Stotz ﬁnished the building in the early
twentieth century, the state-of—the-art facilities
were lavish. The triangular ﬂoor plan features
a large auditorium in the center of the school
with a pool underneath it and classrooms along
the perimeter. ’ . ’

In the front of the building, six columns
guard theset of windows that face the street,
representing the magniﬁcence of the high
school duringthat time period. More windows
line the facility, allowing natural light inside
the building.

Tannler stresses the importance of the aban-
doned building for its national recognition.
The facility is listed on the National Register
of Historic Places —— an official list of the na-
tion’s historic places that are worthy of pres-
ervation. V

The list has a set of criteria for accepted
structures. The stipulations restrict acceptance
to national buildings that have relation to a
speciﬁc person or event, excel in design, are set
in a certain historical period or are important
archaeological sites.

Because the old Schenley High School build-
ing is on the list of the National Register of His-

toric Places, contractors cannot use city money
to alter the building, Tannler explained.

The building is also a part of the Pittsburgh _

History & Landmarks Foundation’s Historic
Landmark Plaque program. Begun in 1968,
the program seeks to promote an educational
aspect to different historical sites in and around
Allegheny County. The foundation places
plaques on buildings it believes to be histori-

’ cally signiﬁcant.

In orderto be apart ofthe plaque program,
buildings mustbe nominated to the PHLF and
to the Historic Plaque Designation Committee.
The committee reviews each nomination, and,
if a building is awarded, it receives a plaque
indicating the signiﬁcance of the building, its
architect and other information. ~‘

Unlike the National Register of Historic
Places, the Historic Landmark Plaque program
does not protect a building from any altera-

A tions; it merely serves to provide the public with

data. .

“Our job is, in some ways, is to promote
preservation and save buildings in the neigh-
borhood. [Schenley High School] has been
recognized nationally as an important school
buﬂdin ” Tannler said.

Falling by the Wayside

The building acted as Schenley High School
for decades unﬁljune 2008, when faculty and

V students moved because of asbestos problems

in_'the_ building.

After a six~month review process, Superin-
tendent Mark Roosevelt armounced in a press
release that itwas not inthe best interest of the
district to rehabilitate the building: Renovations
would cost upward of $75 million.

Today, the building’s exterior continues to

be in good condition, but with asbestos inside ’

the walls, students can no longer learn there. In
June 2011, the old Schenley High School build-
ing was oflicially closed by the Pittsburgh Public
School Board, leaving the massive, classical
structure abandoned. The district then declared
the property _for sale.
The current Schenley High School is located
between the communities of Shadyside and East
Liberty on Denniston Avenue, in the former

, Reizenstein Middle School building.

On Oct. 13, 2011, the district requested bids
for a number of properties, and Schenley High
School was amongthem, said Ebony Pugh, the
senior media relations manager for Pittsburgh
Publiclschools. The district opened the bids
on Oct. 25, but the bid-for Schenley wasrnot
approved, she said. i

The PMC Property Group submitted apro-
posal onthe building for residential use at abid
of $2 million. ’ <

Though a high school education at the time
of the buﬂding’s creation had more prestige
than it does today, Armstrong believes the

structure would still best serve as ahigh school

inthe future. . — 4
“That’s what it was designed for,” Arm-
strong said. “It’s a monumental building, not

' an apartment building.” 3

“On the other hand, some behaviors (such
as parties) may happen whether or not the
team wins a given game.”

Schroeder noted that some student sec-
tions —- even those who support top—1o
teams — struggle to ﬁll all their seats.

“I watch other schools’ student sections
and obviously Duke has been well-docu-
mented,” he said. “They are having trouble
ﬁlling a-student section for a top-10 team. It
says something about the Zoo’s commitment
when we can ﬁll it foran almost sub—5oo
Villanova team.” .

Haybarger also keeps an eye on compet-
ing fandom. *

‘ _ _ “We are deﬁnitely one of the top ones,”

he said. “Duke supposedly was number one,
but if you’ve seen any articles, you see that
their students don’t really show up for the
game anymore.” ,

Lassi added that many student sections

will jump for ﬁve minutes and then become

lackluster. ,

“When [Pitt] is having a great season, and
even this year, [the Zoo] deﬁnitely is as good
as any in the nation,” Lassi said. “We have as
much energy day in and day out.”

Schroeder said the job of the Zoo lead— ‘

ers is to keep students motivated. Hayba—
rger added that this is attempted not only
through tweets, but also through Zoo emails.
The leaders tried to stay optimistic this sea-

‘ son by setting goals, such as continuing the

winning streak when the Panthers seemed
to be turning the season around.
Commitment .
Schroeder and the other leaders not only
go back and watch Pitt games to see how
their cheers sound on television, but will also

‘watch other teams’ games to observe student

sections from across the country.‘

The leaders — who sit in the front row .

for each game — run through a list of four
rotating cheers during_ each Pitt game. De-
pending on the tempo of the game, they’ll
move through one or two cheers on each

~ offensive possession.

“We’re trying to get two or three more
cheers in so it’s not so repetitive,” Schroeder
said. “I’ve gotten a couple of ideas from some
student sections.”

Haybarger said the leaders don’t discour-
age other non-Zoo leaders from starting
cheers. ’

.“If you want to start chants, cool, but try .

to make sure thatit’s not one that we just
did,” Haybarger said. _
Schroeder, Haybarger and Lassi didn’t

a know each other before they got involved

with the Oakland Zoo and Smith said that

ﬁnding a connection through mutual fandom
isn’t uncommon. ‘

“A recent study found that the more a
person bonds with fans of his/her college
team, the less likely he/she is to have con-
nections with others who aren’t fans,” Smith
said in an email. ‘.‘So there are social con-
nections that can be formed between the
fans of a team.”

Students aren’t voted into a leadership
position with the Zoo. Instead, passionate
fans are often noticed and brought into the
role by current leaders.

“We were loud and enthusiastic and very
involved,” Schroeder said. “We know who
is here every game. The reason we don’t do
something like a vote is because it would turn
into a popularity contest. That’s the reason
it’s kind of a hand—picked'thing.”

He added that the current leaders keep
track of students who come to every game.
Once students become leaders, they have to
learn the rules. ,

The Zoo leaders receive a three—page
document detailing what they aren’t allowed
to do with recruits — like offer a free Oak-
land Zoo T—shirt —- due to NCAA rules. The
leaders also aren’t permitted by the athletic
department to write a speciﬁc player’s or
coach’s name on the Whiteboards or swear.
Some cheers —-— such as a USA chant that
broke out against West Virginia —-— drew the
ire of fans. Many complained about the USA
chant directed toward a foreign Mountaineer

player because Talib Zanna, a sophomore '

forward for the Panthers, is Nigerian.

Improvement

The leaders have several ideas for im-
proving the Oakland Zoo for next season.
Schroeder wants to try and bring back an an-
nual bus trip to an away game while Hayba— ‘
rger mentioned students’ request for buddy
passes into the Zoo. For Panther football
games, students can buy buddy passes so
friends who don’t attend Pitt can join them
in the student section. But since there are
fewer basketball tickets and usually more of
a demand,.the same offer hasn’t been made
for the Oakland Zoo.

Schroeder suggested that if students
build up a certain amount of loyalty points

— they should get one buddy pass. Hayba—

Schroeder and Lassi will both return to
the Zoo next year, while Haybarger is still
considering where he will attend graduate
school. All three have fond memories from
their time in the Oakland Zoo.

Schroeder remembers Zanna’s breakaway
dunk near the end of Pitt’s game-opening
19-0 run against Syracuse last season.

“Literally, my ears were ringing,” he said.
“I was yelling at [my friend] next to me and
he couldn’t hear a word I was saying  I just
have this ﬂeeting memory of Talib pounding

just a fantasticthing.”

Haybarger said the loudest he heard the
Petersen Events Center was during the Pan-
thers win over No. 1 Connecticut during his
freshman year in 2009.

“My head started to hurt’because it was
so loud and it was just amazing,” he said..

Lassi also placed the Syracuse win from

his sophomore year as well as Gibbs’ buzzer

The three said they believe the Oakland
Zoo plays a major part in Pitt’s home-court
advantage. Even with seven losses on their

159-19 all-time at the Petersen Events‘ Center
and 12-0 against top-10 teams.

_ Looking for their ﬁrst conference

win of the season, the Panthers

p traveled to Ohio'to take on the Cin-

cinnati Bearcats in athree-game

b series.

The Panthers (13-12, 2-4.Big
East) lost the ﬁrst three games of
their Big East season but began
to ﬁnd their rhythm after a slow
start on the weekend. On the op-
posing side, Cincinnati was also
looking for its ﬁrst Big East win

' of the season.

Cincinnati 2, Pitt 0

Pitt turned to its senior left-
hander Matt Iannazzo for the
Thursday evening game.

The Bearcats (10—f5, 1-5 Big
East) got on the board in the fourth

inning when a runner scored on
a groundout to the shortstop for
what would be the game-winning
run. O ' A

Pitt tallied nine hits in the game
but couldn’t lump them togeth-
er. Throughout the evening, the
Panthers had only two innings in
which they didn’t get a hit. '

“The 1eft—hander for them -

pitched really well — had us a little

bit off-balance,” Pitt manager Joe
. Jordano said. “We had our oppor-
‘ tunities. We had runners in scoring

position in a couple of those in-
nings but just couldn’t get the big
hit. On the_ other side, they did.” '

Iannazzo’s pitching kept the
struggling Pitt offense in the
game. He ﬁnished the day with two
earned runs in seven and a third
innings, allowing 10 hits.

“The pitching didgreat this
weekend and gave us a chance to
win each game,” sophomore out-

ﬁelder Casey Roche said. “The ﬁrst
game, we just didn’t come through
when we needed to. But thanks to
pitching, we were still in the game
to the end.”

Down 1-0 in the seventh inning, '

Pitt put together its best chance

at a comeback. After recording

two outs, junior shortstop Evan

Oswald and sophomore outﬁelder

Stephen Vranka singled back-to-
back. Senior designated hitter An-

thony Defabio, third on the team‘

with a .344 average, ﬂew out to

left ﬁeld, ending the best chance

for the team.

“The ﬁrst game was tough be-
cause Iannazzo pitched so well,” se-
nior ﬁrst baseman Rick Devereaux
said. “The kid facing us did a good
job, and we just couldn’t ﬁnd a way

' to score runs. It happens, but we

have to try and avoid it.”

. Cincinnati added an insurance
run in the seventh inning to bring
the ﬁnal‘ tally to 2-0."

Pitt 6, Cincinnati 0

Sophomore pitcher Ethan Mil-
dren pitched a complete-game
shutout to earn the ﬁrst conference
win for the Panthers. He allowed
only four hits and one walk in his
nine innings and struck out seven

batters.

The offense came through with
six runs to match Mildren’s quality
day on the mound to notch one of

the best all-around games of the
' season for]ordano’s club. A

“Obviously, Ethan pitched‘ spec-
tacular today. He had all his pitches
working for him,” Jordano said.
“We played great defense behind

him and got some clutch hits. Iwas '

very pleased. We’ve been so close
so many times, and I hope this will
propel .us to some big wins in the
next few weeks.”

h Devereaux knocked a single up

the middle as part of the three-hit ’

ﬁrst inning, scoring Vranka, who

_ started the game with a double.

.“It’s always a great feeling get-

ting an early lead,” Mildren said. .

“It sets the tone for the rest of the

“game.”

Defabio scored after being hit
by a pitch and advancing on a wild

1 pitch in the third inning when De-

vereaux singled him in. Devereaux
leads the Panthers with 34 runs

batted in on the season. His .418
batting average is also the team’s
best. «

Freshman outfielder Boo
Vazquez also singled in the sixth
inning to drive in Roche and open
the game to three runs over the
Bearcats. M

With Mildren on the mound,
the Panthers added three runs in

the top of the ninth, setting the
sophomore up for plenty of cush-

ion to earn his complete game.
Pitt recorded only one hit in the
top of the last frame. Sophomore
Derik Wilson came" in to play sec-
ond base in the eighth for a defen-
sive upgrade and connected on a
two—RBI single in the ninth.
Mildren got Cincinnati to
ground in to the game-ending
double play and picked up the ﬁrst
conference win of the season.

- “It is huge to get that ﬁrst Big

East win under our belt,” Mildren
said. “It takes a lot of pressure off
of us, and we can play the game
more relaxed, without pressing
as much.”

“Skip told me to have the best

looking to get on base with a walk
or a single, but I got a pitch 1 could

With pitching dominating the

Knicks’ Jeremy Lin fizzles,

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

bjeremy Lin’s season is over. But
now what? -

Less than two months ago,
the 23-year-old was carrying the
Knicks and the Asian American
community on his back. Now, side-
lined by a torn meniscus and noth-
ing more than a back-page story
because of a drop in production,
the challenges of Lin’s NBA career
will really begin.

When Linsanity ﬁrst ran wild

“Ever the globe, I warned my fel-
low NBA fans to be calm. He had
just played six incredible games,
but it wasn’t time to put him in the
Hall of Fame.

I warned the world about Car-
melo Anthony, the ball-hogging
megastar who was riding the pine
with an injury during Lin’s explo-
sion.

I told you that Amare Stou-

demire’s presence inside would
take away .from Lin’s production
and keep the point guard’s num-
bers low. A

In fact, I placed several bets
among friends that Lin wouldn’t
eclipse 30 points again this season,
despite his explosion for 38 against
the Lakers back in February.

And now, while Lin preps for
surgery, I get to bask in the glory
of being right.

Since Lin dropped 28 points
against the Dallas Mavericks on
Feb. 19, he hasn’t broken 21. In fact,
since that game, he’s only eclipsed
20 points threetimes. In thatsame

time, he has also scored in single

digits three times.

So what happened? What was it
about Feb. 20 that turned Lin into
another guy in the stat box? Well,
it was the return of Anthony.

After Lin went off against the
Mavericks on that fateful day in
February, Melo returned for the
Knicks’ game against New Jersey
the next night to drop 11 points

and log 37 minutes. Since then,
Anthony has been slowly taking

Lin’s minutes have decreased

leaves Panthers guessing

By R._]. Sepich
Staﬁ" Writer -

The Pitt softball team remains
winless in Big East play, but the
Panthers’ struggles are directly
linked to their difﬁcult early
schedule in the conference.

For the second consecutive
weekend in the Big East, Pitt (16-
16, 0-6 Big East) faced and lost
to nationally ranked opposition
after the No. 21 South Florida
Bulls (33-5, 6-0 Big East) swept
the Panthers at the Petersen
Sports Complex.

No. 11 Louisville —- who swept
Pitt last weekend —— and USF are
currently the only two Big East
softball teams in the top 25 of the

USA Today/National Fastpitch

Coaches Association poll.
Despite the defeats, freshman
pitcher Savannah King said that
the Panthers believe that they can
still ﬁnish with a strong season.
“Even though we haven’t
won, we’ve been competitive
with the two best teams in our
conference,” King said. “We know

we have the ability to win games,
we just need to make sure we play
with conﬁdence and energy.”

South Florida 5, Pitt 0

‘ The Bulls’ ‘star sophomore
pitcher Sara Nevins stole the
show in Saturday’s series opener.

Nevins, who entered the
weekend boasting. a 17-2 record
and leading the nation with a .55-
earned run average, struck out
16 of the 22» batters she faced en
route to a no-hit shutout. .

Senior Holly Stevens was the
only Pitt batter to reach base
after she was hit by a pitch in the
ﬁrst inning.

On the mound, King kept
her team in the game until the

ﬁfth inning when South ‘Florida.

scored all of its runs thanks to
four singles and a home run.

South Florida 4, Pitt 0

Pitt’s hitting struggles
continued as the .Panthers were
shut out again ‘in Game 2 of
Saturday’s doubleheader.

This time the Bulls jumped on
King early with three runs in the
ﬁrst inning. That lead was never

in doubt, as Pitt only managed,

two hits against South Florida’s
other
Greiner, a true freshman.

' Pitt freshman inﬁelder Carissa
Throckmorton said after the
series that the Panthers knew
they had to hit better in Game 3 if
they wanted to have a chance.

L “We were really struggling _
with the bats,” she said. “But we

made some adjustments before
[Sunday’s] game, and I think it
deﬁnitely helped.”

South Florida 3,Pitt 2

The Panthers ﬁnally forced

’a few runs across the plate in

Sunday’s series ﬁnale, but they
fell for the eighth time in their
last nine games after a late South
Florida run earned the Bulls the
sweep. .

the Bulls to solitary runs in the second and
fourth innings. '

Then the Panthers’ hitters ﬁnally solved
South Florida’s pitching.

Leading off at the bottom of the fourth

' inning, Stevens reached on an error. Then,

three consecutive singles and a walk tied
the game and loaded the bases for Pitt with
just one out in the inning.

But the next two hitters got out, leaving
the winning runs on base. The missed
opportunity would come back to haunt the
Panthers when South Florida scored the
winning run in the seventh inning.

After Sunday’s game, senior inﬁelder
Niki Cognigni said she hopes the Panthers
can move on from another tough series.’ ‘

“I think that the adjustments we made
today will help us for our games this week,”
she said. “We need to carry that hitting
momentum over into the next couple
games.”

Cognigni also added that she was
impressedwiththeweekend’sperformances
by King and Larkin. '

“We are conﬁdent that our pitchers can

keep us in games. Now we just need to start
scoring,” she said. .

Pitt will hit the road for a pair of games at
Penn State on Wednesday before traveling
to Providence this weekend in search of the
team’s ﬁrst Big East win. I
