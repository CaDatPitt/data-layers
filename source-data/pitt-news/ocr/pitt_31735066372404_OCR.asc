New City Theater
Caught in Struggle

By SETH LUBOVE

The story in the Oct. l9 Pitts‘-
hurgh P().\‘!-Gazette announcing the
opening of a new theater building
for the City Theater Company was
headlined: “Theater puts down
roots.”

George Anderson. Post Gazelle’
entertainment editor. quoted Marc
Masterson. artistic director of the

City Theater Company. as saying:_

“This new theater will at last allow
us to put down roots and grow along
with our sister company. the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival."

How the company has come to be
temporarily uprooted from the ren-
ovated Annex at the cornerofSouth
Bouquet and Sennott streets is
becoming a classic story of bureau-
cratic botch—ups and procedural
oversights. charges of one university
official setting up another university
official. and frustrated community
groups caught in the middle.

ln short. the theater company
constructed a stage in what was
designed as a joint-usage facility
between the university and the Oak-
land community. without the corn-
munity‘s\approval or complete
knowledge. _

Add to that the city’s decision_to

close the building last Thursday
after only one performance of Sam
Shepard’s “Curse of the Starving
Class“ when fire marshals inspected
the theater and discovered viola-
tions of city fire and safety codes.

The play is directed by .led Harris.

The Annex is located in a two-
block area within the boundaries of
Forbes Avenue. part of Oakland
Avenue. Sennott Street. and South
Bouquet Street. The property.
according -to Jay Roling. Pitt‘s
assistant vice chancellor for public
affairs. was designated by the uni-
versity as a buffer /one. or transi-
tional area. between theuniversity
and the South Oakland community.

As a result of the designation.
which sprung out of community
concerns about the university
expansion more than a decade ago.
agreed to put only community-
related offices and departments in
the two-block area. ,

The external studies program
office and the U P Gallery. for exam-
ple. are intended to serve both the
university and the community.

As part of that agreement. potc.n-
tial occupants through Pitt’s Office
of Public Affairs. must submit any
proposalsvfor occupancy withinithc

Curriculum Reform Close to Passage

By MARY KANE

Pitt faculty came one sfep closer
to substantially changing the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences‘ curricu-
lum yesterday when it overwhelm-
ingly approved a new set of general
education requirements.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
members voted 95 to I8 to require

that CAS students take a specific
distribution of courses in the
humanities. and natural and social
sciences. .

Currently. students can take any
nine courses from nine different
departments a total of 27 credits-
to fulfill their distribution require-
ments. The curriculum reform

proposals require students to take a
total of credits in specific areas.

The FAS is scheduled to meet
again Nov. l() to vote on the final
section of the reform proposals.
which calls for the institution of a
new foreign language requirement
and the establishment of faculty
committees to implement the

.-Geographers Present Compromise

By FREDERICK BEERS

A compromise to Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Dean Jerome L.
Rosenberg’s plan to eliminate Pitt's
department of geography was pres-
ented late Wednesday by Depart-
ment Chairmen Hibberd V.B. Kline.

The proposal. contained in a

position paper presented to the Ad _

Hoc Committee of the geography
department. calls for stabilizing the
faculty at eight andilimiting “the
scope of the department to urban
geography and environmental
studies.

Kline states that the plan is
“budgetarilly feasible." and that it
“can be successfully carried out with

no commitment of fresh FAS
money.”
Rosenberg said of the plan.

“Although I would like to be in a

position to support it. there are still

some problems I have with it at the-
present time."

He said he.didn’t want to“get into
the substance of the matter.” but
added that his “primary rationale
for presenting my proposal in the
first place is not met by this counter-
proposal."

He added that the departments
compromise proposal is “apprecia-
bly more costly than mine.”

Specifically. the new plan pro-
poses that history professor Edward
K. Muller. a “qualified. available
and acceptable" candidate. accord-
ing to the proposal. be named chair-
man. and that two new assistant
professors be named. The current
faculty would remain.

Muller. Kline points out. is
already a tenured member ofithe
FAS. and that the salaries ofthc two
new assistant professors would be

covered from the salary of the retir-‘
ing Kline.

Muller said he has “not closed the
doors" yet. and noted that he is “wil-
ling to discuss the issue further ifthe
administration is willing to invest at
a reasonable level.”

Kline also proposes that teaching
assistant teaching fellow positions
be raised to five or six. This expense.
he states. would be covered by the
elimination of part-time instructors.

The proposed faculty. as well as
incoming graduate students. would
structure their courses and studies
around the .two—track emphasis
urban geography and environmen-
tal studies.

Kline says the new directions he
proposes for the department “direc
its energies both to its strengths and

proposals.

The proposals are theiresult of a
two-year studyeof Pitt’s curriculum
by the CAS Committee on Curricu-
lum Reform. The 22-member com-
mittee was formed by CAS Dean
Irwin Schulman in l979 after the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
requested an overhaul of Pitt's pres-
ent curriculum.  C

The FAS previously approved
designating that certain courses out-
side the English department have a"
minimum amount of writing
requirements. and that CAS stu-
dents take at least one math course
topartially fulfill the quantitative
skills requirement recommended by
the corrimittee. -

lf the faculty approves the final

_ section of the report. the quantita-

tive skills requirement will be imple-
mented in the fall of I982 for all
incoming freshmen. with the other
sections ofthc proposals most likely
taking effect the year after. Schul-
mansaid.

FAS members considered ak--L

number of amendments to the gen-
eral education requirement pro-
posal. but passed the curriculum
committees’ recommendations with’
only minor changes.

They approved amendments

graphy classes to satisfy part of the

coalition of community groups.

The committee. known as the
’l‘wo—Block Committee. reviews the
proposals and determines whether
or not the proposed occupant
should be permitted in thearea. then
passes their recommendation on to
the ODI board of directors for final
approval.

In the case ofthe theater company
and the Annex. some of the proper

community procedures were fol--

lowed. but not until the renovations
were almost completed.

Esther Goldman. vice president of
People's Oakland and it member of
the Two-Block Committee. said that
it wasn‘t until Oct. l‘). a little more
than a week before the scheduled
opening of the theater. that the com-
mittee was formally presented with
the proposal to put a theater in the
Annex;

She said that the committee was
planning to postpone its recommen-
dation of the thcatcr‘s occupancy
pending more investigation. until
Marc Mastcrson. the artistic direc-
tor. took the committee to the
Annex and the_y discovered the reno-

is
.§\
.\"

“They took us over there and the
stuff was all in there alread_v. When
we walked in the place was com-
pletely changed." (ioldman said.

The day the committee discovered
the renovations was the same day

the story was published in the Po.v1—‘

(ifcizcnc announcing the opening of
the theater.

(ioldman said that since the com-
mittee was told the theater company
had already arranged for 20 parking
spaces in the Forbes Quadrangle
garage. it assumed the company had
also received the necessary permits
from the city.

“They told us that everything was
set tip to go." she said. “No theater
group would be set to go and give
out releases without having an occu-
pancy permit- We thought they had
a permit for everything. So if it was
alright with the city. it was alright to
go ahead with the pcrfdrmance. and
then we'd discuss it."

So who‘s to blame for the slip—up
in procedures? ‘

(ioldinan places the blame on
Att-ilio “Buck” Favorini. director of
Pitt‘s theater arts department. for

And it‘ \'(iU talk to Roling. he puts
the bmmc back on Favorini for
going ahead with the project despite
mc ubscncc of community and city
approvals. _

Ami that if you talk WlIl1_B0h

\/(){i hc was used by Roling in a

C hi’/girrc plot to “nail Favorini.“

(‘asciato said he was told by Rol-
ing to “ ‘keep it cool. it‘s an inside
struggle‘. “

Casciato said Roling came to his
house on 44’ Boundary Street and
dcggwrcd gt list of ll possible ques-
1i0nSt0;_t§k either Favorini or Mas-
mrmn at ()l)l’s Oct. 22 meeting.

Thg mt included questions such
as:

0 When and where were parking
arrangmcnts made‘? by wliomi’ by
City Thcatct".’ Pitt‘?

. whcrc is the money coming
{mm for pgiinting‘? How much‘?

0 Thc university had previously
restricted spending money within
the 2-Block area because of funding
cutbacks. Sidewalks and exterior in

money is available. Can the univer-
sity justify tuition dollars being

I THE VAMPIRE THAT
CAPTURED STEPHEN KING.

V Masters of fantasy and horror are making a
frightening discovery. The Vampire Tapestry.

Stephen King, author of Salem's Lot and The Shining,
calls it “One of the most thought-provoking fantasies I
have read..-.As a serious examination of the vampire
myth, it is better done than anything in years.
Funny, scary, entertaining, suspenseful. ..readable and
un-put-downabIe!”

The author at The Last Unicorn, Peter S. Beagle.
hails The Vampire Tapestry as  . the best vampire novel
I have ever read. Even if there is no such thing as
vampires, this must be the way they really are."

    On Stage

' The City Theater Company apparently hasthe misguided
notion that they need a new building for their productions.
Why bother‘? From the looks of things. there seems tobe
enough theatrics surrounding the company's decision to
build a stage in the Annex to justify canceling all future

productions and charging admission to the next time the

companytriesto openthetheaterwithoutcommunity orcity
approval.

Depending on which role you‘re playing. the controversy
over the theater company setting up shop in the old Annex is
taking the appearance of either a tragedy or a comedy.

The Hamlet in this tragedy seems to be the young City
Theater Company. Evicted from the Northside stage it
shared with the Pittsburgh Public Theater. the company
finally found a place to settle "down and create its own

. identity.

At least the company thought it did. until last Thursday

"when thefire marshal shut the place down because of viola-

tions of the city fire code.

But that wasn't the only violation" the company commit-
ted. lt seemed there were a’ series of procedures which needed
to be followed before any renovations could be done to the
Annex. the least of which included informing the commun-
ity that the building was going to be converted into a theater.

For the record. the-community has no objection to-the
company_staging plays in the Annex. lfanything. some quiet
entertainment in what was once used to give rock concerts‘
can only serve to enhance the character of the community.

What the community groups that make up Oakland

~ .Directio‘ns Inc. are concerned aboutis their ‘lack of input

into the decision to put the theater in the building. If it
happens now. what will the university decide to put in next.
they argue. . A < .
But the theater company. an unwitting victim in a snafu of
bureacratic slip-ups. had a production to put on. and went
with the philosophy that the show must go on. W ’
The comedy comes in placing the blame on how the
theater ever got in the building in the first place without
having satisﬁed the necessary requirements for occupancy.
‘The community says it was Buck Favorini‘s fault for
telling the theater coming to go ahead and renovate the
Annex despite knowing that neither the community nor the

"city had approved the occupancy.

We'd like to say nobody is to blame for the incident and

So. everybody is to blame.

Dear Editor: .
As a Pitt football player and a

. resident of Brackenridge Hall. l res-

ent —the sensationalistic headline in
Friday's edition of The Pitt Ne»n_'s.,
I “was a resident in one of the

rooms discussed in the article. From -

my perspective. this is not a case of
the students vandalizing-the u.nIive.r-
sity. but of the university va.ndali/.-
ing the students. As residents ofthe
dorms will tell you. the university
has a policy for assessing the dam-
ages done to the rooms at the end of

the year. For the most partpthe uni-~

versity is fair in charging the stu-
dents for damages done in their
living quarters. However. in the ease
referred to in The ‘Pitt News. the
university was anything but fair.
Allow me to state some examples
of the way students in our suite were
treated. examples The PM News

‘ story omitted. _At the end of the

I980-8| school year. our suite was
assessed $ll3.l2 for rug shampoo
for all the rooms within our suite.
Two university employees spent
eight hours cleaning the rugs. We
were charged professional wages.
butthe job" was far from profes-
sional. We later had to clean the rug
ourselves: we did afar more “profes-
sional" job for a SIS rental fee and
only an hour's time. The same kind
of exorbitant overcharging can be
seen in the university billing for the
paint used in repainting the rooms
($ol9.()()). $t‘»l9.()() is an awful lot of
money. especially considering the
shabby job that was done.'Since the
time of the university‘s painting. we
have had to repaint over areas. at a
far less cost. So. The Pin N(’H‘.S' head-

. line of$3.()(l(l reflects the.univcrsity‘s
inflated labor fees. not the actual
situation. .

Other areas of the story also do
not stand up. The article talks of
beer kegs being thrown against
walls. carpeting being‘ set- on fire.
tampering with firehoses. damage
to the elevators. and the spitting of
chewing tobacco ontothe walls. ceil-
ings and floors. Yet where is there
evidence that it was football players
who engaged in these practices? This
is a rumor reported as fact. As for
the tobacco stains on the ceiling. if
anyone tried that stunt. it wouldn‘t
be the ceiling that would bear the
brunt of that damage. As for the
“Bust—llp Party“ that was allegedly
held in which uni\'ersit_v property
was supposedly destroyed what
tIniversit_\' property is The Pill .V’cIi's
talking about‘? No u/H'I'm'.s'iI_I‘ prop-
erty was destroyed at any party.

Dear Editor: _

After spending four years in a
dorm and nearly a year-and-avhalf

in an off-campusapartment. l have -I

never really had the slightest bit of
fear about living in Oakland. Walk-
ing down numerous streets at odd
hours ofthe night never presented a
problem. After all. I'm a guy ~ not a
Hugh Green. but still you wonder
who is going to bother a male stu-
dent on aimajor. relatively well-lit
street at an hour that few people
would consider‘ excessively late?

Aside from that.. it could never‘

happen to me.

P But on Friday night. Oct. 30. it
did. While walking back to my
apartment after visiting a friend in
the Towers. l first became suspicious

as two males about my age singled’

me out at a busy intersection by yel-
ling “Hey you!“ Not seeing any great"
cause for alarm. especially since
there were other people around. l
continued to walk down I Fifth

Avenue past Wendy‘s. The further I ‘
walked. the less people there were '

around. andfthe more mysuspicions
‘grew. At this point. a sensible thing
would have been to go inside a pub-
lic facility such as a pizza shop. But
it‘s hard to always do the sensible
thing. ‘

From here on. it was only me. the
sidewalk and this guy about 20 feet
behind. His partner was now on the
other side of the street ‘‘acting‘‘ as if
he was hitch.-hiking. Walk out ofthe
middle of the street‘? Scream‘? Turn
around and run towards campus?
No. I just kept walking. After all. it
could never happen to me.

Suddenly. I was gripped with a

fear that l had never before;

experienced one of tremendous
u/nccrtainly of impending doom.

‘Now being very close to my destina-
_ tion. I jumped over a short brick

wall and began running toward the

front door. Just then l was tackled
‘ from behind and brought to my

knees. lt‘s incredible what races
through your mind at that instant.
Your money‘? Your jewelry‘? Your
life‘?

Thank God. the first of these was"
the only thing surrendered. Whether
it comes from watching old “West-

erns” or simply acting on impulse.,

somehow l didn't have to.think
about it too long when they
demanded my money. Act rational‘?
Keep a cool head‘? i’ suppose I did. in
that fortunately l came out of the
incident unhurt and minus only a
few dollars. Later that night. after
talking to the police. l started play-
ing the “what if“ game.

The whole point is that the entire
ugly experience might never have
happened IF I would have acted

upon my initial suspicions. But I"

didn‘t. thus paying the consequen-
ces. Since it did happen. l‘m only
glad I didn't decide to play Captain
Marvel or Superman or whatever. A
couple of not-too-bright young
creeps got away. at least temporar-
ily. For a few dollars. they risked
ruining their entire lives. I. on the
other hand. learned many valuable
lessons: most importantly. that it
can happen to me.

The CaseiFo_r City Paramedics

By SETH LUBOVE

While the Pitt Panthers were on
the field Oct. 24 bringing their
record up to 6-0 by defeating the
Syracuse Orangemen. another team
was in the stands fighting a more
important battle.

It was a battle to save the life of
miald Derrick. 46. of Bethel Park.
who suffered a fatal heart attack
while watching Pitt‘s annual home--
coming game.

In a routine report ofthe incident.
the stadium physician. Dr. Gregg
Goldstrohm of Pitt's orthopedics
department. added an extra supple-
ment in which he was reportedly
critical of the emergency medical
service provided by the ambulance
service currently under contract
with Pitt.

Perman Ambulance Service Inc.
is the firm that currently serves Pitt
 football games.

The Pitt News, while following up
on the story. interviewed an emer-
gency medical specialist and the
director ofthe city's emergency med-
ical service to get their opinions on
hiring city paramedics to cover the
stadium games.

While neither the stadium physi-
cian nor the emergency medical spe-
cialists would speculate if Derrick
would have lived had the city para-
medics been there. they agreed that
stadium medical care could be
enhanced by the city paramedic
teams.

Dr. Paul Paris
Director, Pitt’s
Emergency Medical

Residency» Program

Many years ago. when the city ser-
vice was just starting. at that time
they really could not commit a vehi-
cle full-time to the games. But now
they have the manpower and the
vehicles available. so that were pre-
pared to have a vehicle and teams of
paramedics.

The University of Pittsburgh has
just started this year an emergency
medical residency. So we have set up
a plan to have teams of emergency
medicine residents who are trained
in advanced life support and the
Pittsburgh paramedics. who are
probably the best paramedics in the
world. at the games. We've submit-
ted a proposal to the health and
safety division of the university and
we're just in the process of meeting.

But we suspect that we‘ll have no‘

problem getting it instrumented.
When. I’m not sure. but we suspect
that we'll have no problem doing it.

We also planto dothis attheCivic

ceptablc to have inferior paramedic
services at city events.

It makes sense now that we havea
university program giving medical
commands and orders to the (city)
paramedics. that the university at
least provide itself with the service.

"Emergency medicine is a brand
new specialty. There are certain
areas of medicine that have been
ignored in the past. One. for exam-
ple. is pre-hospital care. Another
one is disaster preparation and
planning.

One of the things about the resid-
ency is it‘s going to have far—reaching
effects in terms of delivery of emer-
gency medical service to the whole
area. This is _just one example.

What if we had a multi—casualty
incident‘? What if some deranged
individual set off a bomb in the
stands‘? Or several people got drunk
and I2 people fell down the steps?
Are we prepared to deal with inci-
dents where two or more people are
hurt‘? A

By having our residents and para-
medics there I think we would have a
plan drawn up so that we could deal
with a multi—casualty incident.

Basically. it would cost the univer-
sity almost next to nothing. Our
physicians would be free. the vehicle

would be free. and the paramedics _

would be paid their normal hourly
rate which is not much.

So. it would not be a major under-

general education requirements.
The amendments the faculty
rejected were: ‘

0 One by physics professor Philip
Stehle to divide courses in the
humanities and natural and social
sciences. into two categories and
require that students take I2 credits
in each area.

“The CAS committee‘s proposal
is too vague and complicatedito be
practically implemented.“ Stehle
said. He said his proposal was not in
its final form. and that its details
would have to be worked out by a
committee.

Schuilman. however. said Stehle’s
proposal amounted to “a warmed-
over version of the present distribu-
tion of studies requirement."

taking. So all we need now is the
contract to be worked out between
the university and the city of Pitts-
burgh Emergency Medical System.

I don't think ther‘sgoingto be any
resistance from the. university.

Glenn Cannon
Director, Pitt’s
Emergency Medical
Service

because I think they‘ll realize that we
can improve the services that are
presently provided.

We're suggesting to Pitt that
maybe they ought to have the city's
paramedics and some physicians
stand by at the games rather than a
private ambulance service.

What we're trying to do at any-
place where there are large crowds. if
it falls within our service area. is get
our teams there. rather than teams
that fall outside the system of the
City of Pittsburgh. And so we're
talking about Three Rivers Sta-
dium. the Civic Arena and Pitt. We
already have an agreement with the
David Lawrence Convention
Center. A

0 One by Professor Norman Aust-
cm of physics to prohibit allowing a
developmental and; or methodolgi-
cal option in the natural science
requirement. This option allows stu-
dents to satisfy part of their natural
science requirement by taking a
course about sciences. but not neces-
sarily in the science department.

0 One by Professor Michael Bik-
erman ofgeology to increase the nat-
ural science requirement to I5
credits and to require that students
also take a laboratory course.

Shulman said that this proposal
was impractical because the univer-
sity does not have the resources to
accomodatc more laboratory
courses. '

cm of history and Ezra Newman of
physics to increase the natural

What happens is that any time
you have a large crowd of pe0pl€.
they‘re going to generate a certain
number of calls. And compared to
Three Rivers Stadium. Pitt seems to
generate a lot of heart or cardiac
related problems.

It may be due to the fact that-at
Pitt. you get a lot of old alumni who
have been with the university for
years and years versus Steclers
games where you get all kinds of
people. But it seems in my history
since I've been with the city that the
university games generate a lot more
cardiac cases.

What happens is that when you
have that many people together. it’s
just the same as having your popula-
tion sprcad out. but it concentrates
the incident in that location.

For example. there was an injury
at a wrestling match at the Civic
Arena a few weeks ago. Now. they're
right across the street from Central

Medical Pavilion. but it took I7,

minutes for them to get to us
through their system an_d get that
guy to the hospital. Whereas had we
been there. that delay would not
have occurred. They sent us to the
wrongigate because they gave the
wrong dispatch information.

It‘s a terrible thing. So if you have
people on the scene you can reduce
the response time. and there is a
greater percentage chance that the
guy is going to live.

Favorini. however. claimed that it
was RoIing‘s responsibility to have
all the necessary city and communit_v
requirements satisfied before the

‘Oct. 29 opening.

Favorini said he has been meeting
with Roling since this summer. and
that they had agreed the theater was
a good idea. He said that Roling was
supposed to have organi/ed meet-
ings with the community and the
city. but that the fell
through.

“I w role to him and I said we can-
not wait any longer. that we had a
play to mount and when are we
going to hayc our meetings‘? /\nd he
just my er held the meeting until we

meetings

had to actually announce that we
were opening our tlicatcr." lay orini
sztld.

He said he was disappointed that
the theater had toshut dow it after its
opening performance. but that it
was a problem he has encountered
before.

“I am used to dealing with

s

bureaucracies in one kind or
another. and when the university
bureaucracy meets the city bureau-
cracv. that‘s two bureaucracies
you‘ve got to deal with." Favorini
said.

While he acknowledged the com-
munity's concerns as legitimate.
l*avorini said it was not a case ofthe
uni\ersity working behind the
scenes.

“Our intention in thcatcrarts was
and is to work as candidly and
dircctl_v and closely with the com-
munit_v as we can. It”s just that the
people who should have sat across
the table and worked this all outjust
didn‘t get to sit down." he said.

Roling. on the other hand. said
that when I-iayorini came to his
office with the proposal_ he told
laxorini that the community would
nc\ er agree to moyc out of the two-
block arczi.

Roling and Bernard
Kobosky. vice chancellor for public
affairs. gave Iiayorini two options:
lind altcrnatiyc community meeting
space within the two—block area or
find some place else on campus to

said he

stage the performances.

As_of September. there was still
no alternative space for either the
community or the theater. Roling
said.

When asked why the theater arts
department went ahead with its plan
to put the City Theater Company in
the Annex without the necessary
approvals. Roling said that Favorini
would haye to answer the question.

“We would have to disclaim
responsibility." he said. “Dr. Favo-
rini made his own decisions to iakc
ovcr that space. He had to because
he had made committmcnts to put
on the performances.“

Roling also said the community
was justified in its concern about
being left out of the decision to put
the theater in the Annex. but that “it
wasn‘t a move by the uni\ ersity to be
adverse to the community."

Sandy Phillips. president of()l)l.

said a meeting will be scheduled next C

week between the theater arts
department and the Two-Block
Committee to review the matter.

worry about those guys. they 'rejust
a little bloody from being up ther,
just step over them and climb those

stairs. By the way, good luck.

In the strangest of years. the
strangest of teams has fate by the
neck and is slowly squeezing itsjug-

teams wereht the same posititon and
failed to.hold on to it.

Supposedly rebuilding. the Pitt
Panthers. after a succession oflosses
and "a steady uphill climb. have
reached the No. I spot and now have
to hold it. And holding it has been as
easy as trying to hit a Goose Gossagc
fastball. H 

Upon reaching No. l. strange
things begin to happen. Teams of
obvious inferiority begin to drool all
over themselves. their eyes ablare

with a hatred. and their muscles ner-
vously twitching just itching for a

Jackie Sherrill. a hunter for five.
years. has all of sudden become the
hunted. After narrowly beating Bos-
ton College last week. coupled with
Penn State’s loss to Miami (Fla.).
the Panthers have finished their
incredible climb to No. l. The trick
is to stay there]

The Panthers almost couldn‘t stay

After vaulting to No. l. it can only
get worse. '

Waiting anxiously is Rutgers. a

team that has had two full weeks to r

ddium

get pumped up for their biggest
game of the year. Not that they
haven‘t been in the postion before.
Last year. No. l Alabama confi-
dently swaggered into Giant Sta-
thinking their ranking
wouldn’t be challenged by a Rutgers
team still trying to make people
believe that they were a Division l—A
school. Three hours later. the Tide
was lucky to crawl out ofthe palatial
stadium with a l7—l3 win. Its a
situation that Rutger's Head Coach
Frank Burns relishes. if

“Any kid worth his salt loves to
play against the No. I team in the
nation. We look forward to playing
the top—ranked team. We"ve done it
before and enjoyed it." ‘

Enjoyment is exactly what Burns
is stressing in his practices. Burns. a
realist. knows full well that his
team’s chances are slim at best. so a
"free andloose approach" has been
installed.

IUP Cracks Pitt defense, 4-0

IUP only led l-() at the end ofthe

lUP‘s Langdon scored the first
goal off a corner kick with 27 mi-

headed the ball into the net.

This weekend. the Lady Panther '

volleyball team will wind down its
regular season play as it travels to
the Western Michigan University
Invitational for its last regular sea-
son competition of the year.

This tournament. the second-
toughest on the Pitt schedule this
season. will feature an array of
 ong teams from the Big l()and the
.t A idwest. In preliminary action. Pitt
will face stiff competition from
Southern lllinois-. University of Illi-
nois and Northwestern.

Pitt Coach Shelton Collier cited
Northwestern as being the stepping
stone between __Pitt and playoff
action in the tournament. “North-
western is probably the best team we
will play all year. They have been in
the Top I() all year. as high as No. 6.
and they are probably the top team
in the country outside ofthe Califor-
nia teams.

“Northwestern is very good but if
we play well we can beat them. and

we do against a team in the Top I0."
Collier said.

The game will be played on the

PBT Dancers To Solo In ‘Pas De Quatre' I

~pBY LINDA MILLER

In ballet, the realization that the
dancers are actors projecting words
and emotions through their every
movement makes for a more exciting
and moving experience.

Although many dancers receive
_formal acting training in school, most
learn through experience.

”You study mime, but mostly you
learn to show emotion in all of your
body through experience," says Hilda
Reverte, a soloist dancer with what
many consider be be one of the
nation's leading ballet troupes, the

 Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre (PBT).

”Throughout a performance you
think to yourself the words you
would be saying it aloud."

"Just as an actor projects himself
with words, a dancer projects himself
in movement," adds Margo Scharlin,
another PBT soloist dancer. ”You
have to concentrate and believe in
yourself."

This self—confidence needed in
ballet often requires years of dedica-
tion and discipline.

”At the age of four I was intro-
duced to dance," says Helen Dexter, 3
PBT soloist originally from Alabama

‘who has worked with the San Diego

Ballet and the Ballet West. "I was for-
tunate when I was young in having
excellent teachers who taught me the
importance of being dedicated and
optimistic . It's a sin that some people
are allowed to open up ballet

studios.”
But dedication and discipline often

mean personal sacrifices.

”I graduated high school early and
worked to save up enough money to
attend the Pennsylvania Ballet
School,” says Scharlin, a Californian
who has danced with numerous
ballet companies including the San
Francisco Ballet and the Pennsylvania
Ballet. ’’In addition to school and
work, I would always manage to prac-
tice at least four or five hours a day.”

The long hours of practice do not
stop after the first few years, butare
carried over into professional ballet.

A typical day for the 36 PBT
dancers begins at 9:15 a.m. with an
hour and a half class at the PBT's
headquarters on the Boulevard of the
Allies, downtown. Included in this
class are a study program for tech-
nique strengths and weaknesses and

;‘%,;gi‘.‘.dLiated exercises. Following the

class, the dancers rehearseupcoming
ballets with choreographers from 11
a.m. to 6 p.m., with an hour break
during the ‘afternoon.

And how do PBT dancers spend

their one day off a week?

"Cleaning house and "doing
laundry," says Reverte with Dexter
and Scharlin indicating that she's not
the only one spending her Sundays in

that manner.

Another soloist dancer, Nancy
Glynn, explains the PBT is very
appealing to aspiring dancers.

"Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre allows a
dancer to work with noted choreo-
graphers, tour the country and to
develop through both classes and
performances," says Glynn, a dancer
who worked with the Pennsylvania
Ballet before coming to PBT. "It is
also one of the top 10 troupes in the

country—~on par with Pennsylvania
Ballet. Houston Ballet and Ballet
West."

Currently, all four soloists dancers
are rehearsing their leading roles in
the ballet Pas De Qunlre, which is sche-
duled to open with the world pre-
miere of Dnphnis mm’ Chloe by Patrick
Frantz, at Heinz Hall on Friday,
November 20 at 8 p.m.

According to Beverly Kweller, pub-
lic relations director of PBT, Pas De
Qzmlre is the most famous divertisse-
ment (a short ballet) in history.

”It was created for four of the five

"ELEN DEXTER

HILDA REVE2l\‘TE

greatest ballerinas of the 19th cen-
tury by Iules Perrot to showcase each
individual's talent/she explains/’but
problems developed among the bal-
lerinas as to who should have what
place of honor.”

Each PBT soloist dancer will por-
tray oneof the famous ballerinas, and
Reverte says there will be subtleties
on stage that allude to their fighting.

"The audience will pick up these
hypocrisies," says Reverte, a dancer
who has just entered her fourth sea-
son with the PBT. "It should be amus-
ing and- beautiful to watch a style that
is completely different from any of
today."

Pas De Qzmtro will no doubt compli-
ment the world premiere ballet Daph-
His and Chlov which is based on the
Greek love story. The ballet has been
choreographed by PBT’s Artistic
Director, Patrick Frantz, who was
b0m in Paris and trained at the Paris
Opera Ballet where he was promoted
I0 premier danseur. He also served as
resident choreographer of the Pen-
nsylvania Ballet and the artistic direc-
tor of Tucson Ballet before joining
PBT in 1978. '

’’I am eagerly anticipating the pre-
miere of Daphnis and Cl0t’, which I have
choreographed to Ravel's beautiful
score," Frantz writes in the PBT's
1981-82 Season brochure. ”It’s a
ballet that challenges and showcases
the artistic and technical achieve-
ments of our company and one I have
long wanted to present in
Pittsburgh."

A Worchester, Massachusetts
critic who previewed the PBT's Daph-
nis aml Chloe at the 122nd Worchester
Musical Festival two weekends ago
gives the Pittsburgh audience an indi-
cation of what to expect later this
month in his review: This 'Dnphnis and
Chloe’ materialized as a slm1ning—su((ess '
...Frzmlx' Frantz leaves an iiiilolihle impression
with his lirillanl lrmtmerzl of works in n
moilern iiliom.

I It is 12:04 and I'm still getting
nothing but static from this inge-
nious little device that tapes conver-
sations off the telephone. My first big
interview and technology fails me!
12:09 and I think, is it working?

I Where'is my editor (I later discover b

she was held captive by "General

’ Hospital")? Who cares, Famous peo-

ple don't mind waitintg when it's
Showcase magazine calling, right? So
I began my interview with Dave

   

Shounase

Intervieu2 

of Rock Lists Marsh said there was a
short period when "I was between-
Born To Run and whatever came next,I
didn't know." It washere that the
idea for the book came along, the
spark of-which was provided by one
of Marsh's favorite writers, Phil Pep-
kie, who is a sports columnist for The
New York Daily News, had just put
out the Sports Book of Lists and Marsh

thought,"I could do this, I could do

this with rock’n roll, there is really
more to rock’n roll so you could do a
better job." ‘

Marsh, college drop-out, one—time

(Editor of CREEM magazine, one-

time assistant editor at Rolling Stone,
author of Born To Run The Brurr Swing-
steen Story and the recently released

— Book of Rork Lists.

Marsh grew up in Michigan at a
time when musical influences were
plenty. Motown was big at the time
as were rockers like Mitch Ryder, Del

L Shannon, and of course Elvis. But,

Marsh insists that his obsessions

‘ with rock 'n‘ roll is still secondary to

‘his love of writing. When asked when

v he first thought the two could lead to

a career Marsh replied," When I was
about 14, and they (Capital Records)
had this contest, 25 words or less why
I like the Beach Boys, and I won".

'Thus Dave Marsh emerged with the

Beach Boys Canter! Album and his pas-
sions for writing unscathed.
In disclosing the history of the Book

///////    

Thus, with an‘ incredible arson of
music information already stored
away, Marsh began work on the con-
cept. The finished product involved
what Marsh calls ”the basic work that
I guess nobody believes that it takes
to write a book. It isn't glamorous, it
is in the trenches, reading books,

writing letters, phoning managers I

and finally getting a I-finally—spoke-
with—Chubby—and-these-are-his-
answers."

That work in’ the trenches by
Marsh and co-author Kevin Stein has
yielded a consumate book of over 600

" pages. The book has thirty-two chap-

ters deverted to topics diverse as
"Drugs, Death and Rock 'N Roll" to
”Dancing" to ”Bob Dylan". It tells you
everything you didn't ‘know and
maybe even things you didn't care to
know but its like "Rubbick's Cube" in
that you are afraid to put it down

bcause you know someone else is
bound to pick it up. However, its true
value is to that generation that as
activist Jon Duncanson put it "was
caught between Vietnam and Calvin

Klein." For rock’n roll junkies of this

age, it re-creates a whole era of music
that, considering present trends, we
may never see again. D
However, as good a book as Rock
Lists is, Marsh still sounds more
enthusiastic about Born to R1m(this
might be due in part to the success of
the recently released updated mass
market paper—back that has, accord-
ing to March, ”already sold over

\lO0,000 copies"). I was unsure as to ‘

how Marsh would react to questions
concerning Bruce or the biography.
Would he be a little sensative about

always being identified with Spring-

steen? I couldn't have been more
wrong!‘ (This . occurred often
throughout the interview.) Marsh
put it best when he said," If I were to
be too closely, identified with the
greatest‘ performer in the world
today, I'll suffer through it{laughi_ng}."
Marsh went on to say, "It may dam-
age my credibility with people who
don't like Bruce, but, if people don't
like Bruce theyprobably wouldn't
like me anyhow, we've got a lot in
common." I

Just how wrong had I been about
Marsh's identification with Spring-
steen? Was Marsh himself a little too
caught up in the "Hey, I know Bruce
Springsteen" syndrome. No, I don't
think so, because first of all Dave
Marsh is too much of a professional
for this, and secondly, I was con-
vinced by the sincerity with which he
spoke concerning the book and rock

in general. For example, Marsh sum- I

marized the Success of Born To Run
saying, ”That is the best there is,
knowing you've reached people,
whether through the vehicle of Bruce
or whatever, and helped them feel
better about their lives, gave them a
greater sense of possibilities."

I believe him, ifyou don't like Bruce
Springsteen, you probably wouldn't
like Dave Marsh! I

Marsh's views on the rest of the
music industry are not different
today than those he used to cast a
pretty dim future for rock in;last
December's year-end issue of Rolling
Stone. Along this vein though,
Marsh did make an important distinc-
tion between players and ‘listeners

t‘

N

\$    \..

and the roles each" play in rock's
future.

"I see bands all the time that could
help the situation, I think you've got
two bands in Pittsburgh in The

. Houserockers and Nardini (as in Nor-

man & The Tigers I assume) who
could help,"says Marsh. However, its
our responsibility to go out and make
good decisions and to "not just take
the shit that radio gives them."
Commenting’ on’ the attention
given the Rolling Stones as of late
Marsh replied, "who cares.7, it's a

tourist attraction, it's like going to
~ Disney World, it ain't heaven but at

leastyou were there: I can't take
music that lightly." Marsh went on to
say, ”It’s a -pathetic when Mick Jagger
has to put down other musicians and
rock in -general just ’cause he is old
and tired now.”

On a more positive note,’ Marsh
spoke briefly of Elvis, stating that he
was the one person he wanted to

‘interview but never had the chance

to. Possibly in response to that,
Marsh says that he has just written a
book about Elvis, from a purely artis-
tical point of view. Unlike everything
else you seem to ‘read these: days,
Marsh claims that his book stays clear
of moral judgements and lists of the
drugs alledgedly taken by Presley. ”In
the book I only care about how he
sings, not whether he was a junkie or
not," he explained.

By the end of the interview, Marsh
had opened my eyes to both rock 'n
roll (”I don't think there is a contra-
diction between growing old and
being into rock, that is a misunder-
standing, it's not teen-age music")
and to writing ("The best time for
you has to be at the typewriter or you

are not doing the right thing withi

your time”). It's not that such
insights haven't been held in the past
it's just that Dave Marsh is special in

I that he posseses not only a love for

and an understanding of rock 'n roll,
but also the talents to communicate
what it all means to greater picuture
of each of our lives. {

‘Marsh feels that rock, "has to do
with certain ideals about democracy
and having an opportunity to have a
voice in a society where increasingly
people aren't given a voice unless
they have a certain social position."
Sound familiar? I think it's true, Dave
Marsh and Bruce Springsteen do
have a lot in common!

‘And so it goes in Peter Weir's latest "

film, (I.u’Iz',»mli (accent on the second

intended to be a grand war epic, but
somewhere along the line goes awry.

The subject is an old and familiar
one; the senselessness of war and the
useless deaths of countless young
men. We've seen and heard this
before; most notably in Stanley
Kubrick's far superior Put/z.~‘ at (Elm-_u.
But don't expect any new and pro-
found insights in this one. In fact,
don't expect asmooth and coherent
plotline either. Along these lines,
Weir does not deliver. This film has a
great deal of style, but it has no sub-
stance whatsoever.

The story, by Weir, centers on two
young athletes, played very well by
Mell Gibson and Mark, Lee, who

This is a trite and banal plot to be
sure, and despite Russel Boyd's beau-
tifulwphotography and Weir's excel-
) film never
manages to transcend this prosaic
level. lt is fully of silly and trivial
dialogue and, in fact, becomes
nothing more than a thoughtless
army comedy during the long and
mostly unnecessary Egyptian romp
sequence. All of the typical army
toilet jokes are present here and the
soldiers are shown having mindless
fun amidst the distant sounds of
exploding mortar shells.

There are times, though, when the
film seems to be better than it really
is, such as the scene in which the two
leads encounter an old prospector
during their trek across the desert,
who is completely ignorant of the
war and asks who are they fighting

Up And Coming Bands:

MANCINI'S———OCTOBER 29, 1981'

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK
and

JANE HOLAHAN

The guy at the next table leaned
over and said, "I know Pete Hewlett,
in fact I was supposed to go golfing
with him today.” This came after the
guy at the adjoining table mentioned
that his friend's girlfriend's sister
(got that?) was married to Pete. Pete
who, ask you? Pete Hawlett, guit-
arist/singer for Novo Combo. Actu-
ally, it seems like everybody at
Mancini's knows him, which isn't
unusual since Pete's from McKees
Rocks.

This was a big night for Pete——the
big homecoming, small town boy
makes good, etc., etc. And Pete and
his band didn't disappoint the crowd,
a crowd that included such Pitts-
burgh luminaries as the reclusive
David Werner, and Ioey and Hermie
Granati, who had just completed
touring with Van Halen. Even the
Silencers, who opened the show,

stuck around for Novo Combo’s set.
It was no fluke that the Who's Who
of Pittsburgh Rock showed up——
Novo Combo proved themselves
worthy of the attention.

With Pete Hewlett on guitars and
vocals, Michael Shrieve on drums,
Jack Griffithon guitar, and Stephen
Dees on bass and vocals, the band
was solid, tight, and well-rehearsed.
They gave no clues that they had
been together only one and a half
years, and have but one album, the
newly released Novo Comlm.

The band's music is a combination
of pop, rock and reggae, something
like the Police, but original just the
same. It was obvious that every
member of Novo Combo was an
excellent musician in his own right,
unlike so many other bands today
who depend on one or two standouts.

"They all have impressive credentials:

Shrieve was one of the original
members of Santana and remained
with them seven years, going on to
play studio sessions with the Rolling
Stones on their last three albums;
Pete Hewlett has played with Carly
Simon and Eric Carmen; and Stephen
Dees was associated with Hall and
Oates before recording a solo album.

 

  
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
   
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  

"You gotta pay your dues,"‘said
Stephen after the show, "but you get
your rewards. Even now we still

practice a lot. Doing what we do isn't

easy, it's hard work, but I don't mean
that as a complaint. I love what I do, I
wouldn't have it any other way."

Pete nods in agreement. We're
having fun right now, we've been
blessed enough to be able to enjoy
what we're doing. For myself, and I
think for the rest of the band, this is
important time professionally. But I
can't really say that I feel a lot of
pressure——as far as I'm concerned,
the tour and the album are two of the
best things that have ever happened.

"lust getting out and playing our
songs——seeing people's faces, their
reactions~—that's the greatest thing
there is," Stephen exclaimed. "And
knowing that we're appreciated. Like
when we check the charts in a city
that we played a week ago and see
that our album is selling well and
that our music is being played there.
We want people to like us, so we feel
that we're accomplishing that."

It might be easy to win over a
crowd the size of Mancini's, but if
more success comes, and the crowd

THE BLASTERS
The Decade
10-29-81

”It happened again..." I mused to
myself as my left hand travelled back.
ﬁand forth across the pounded copper
‘Surface of one of the many empty
tables within the dimly lit cesspool
of the Decade. This had to be the
bottom of the barrel...After all, what
could be worse than sitting alone in a
empty bar with no money waiting for
a band that no one else is waiting for.
Tonight, everyone else was out
watching Iggy and I'm waiting for
the Blasters. Little did I know that it
would be well worth the wait.
According to Music Connection
Magazine, the Blasters were voted
L.A.'s number one band by the musi-
cians of the Los Angeles area——they
even beat out the Go-Go's. These

“‘guys all hail from Downey, Califor-

nia, but don't start laughing——
they've studied under some of the
best. It seems that twicea week most
of these guys used to go down to
Watts (the Harlem of L.A.) and learn
the strings from such legends as’T-

 

Bone Walker, Lee Allen and Marcus
Iohnson (Muddy Waters’ arranger).
Some guys get all the breaks...

Drummer Bill Bateman is the first
to enter the Decade. His wiry
combed-back hair and slow—drawn
smile make him more a candidate for
a Bluegrass band than the Blasters. I
approach him and try to start some
inkling of a conversation-—it doesn't
work.

”Do they serve food here?" he asks
with a bleary-eyed gaze that fixes
itself somewhere on the wall behind
me. I mumble some answer and press
for the interview. ”Yeah sure," he
says and points me towards brothers
Dave(lead guitarist) and Phil (vocals,
mouth harp, guitar) Alvin. These
guys resemble a cross-breeding of
Delbert McClinton and Porter Wag-
goner (including the pompadours).
Dave is quick to sit down and answer

questions while Phil remains stand-.

ing, pacing and deftly interjecting
his brother's answers witha caustic
air that only another brother could
tolerate.

Dave explains that the band has
just come through the Midwest play-
ing about fifteen dates in small clubs

and halls.

‘Tor a band that's touring without

an album we're doing great," he says,
"We got fantastic receptions in Wis-
consin and St.’ I.ouis...In fact about
the only places we didn't go over
were Cincinnati and probably here,"
he laughs as he cocks his head
towards the numerous empty tables.
I explain to him about Iggy Pop and
he nods his head. "We probably
should have...” ‘
”I probably should have beat up
Iggy," snaps Phil with a devilish
grin,”...but then again he'd probably
enjoy it.” This evokes a healthy
laugh, but Dave struggles to
continue.

The Blasters’ music has often been
described as ”rockabilly” but both
brothers will adamantly disagree:
"Rockabilly is such an inaccurate,
limiting term—it's almost racist. If
you had to classify us, sure, we do
rockabilly but we also do coun-
try,R&B, and rock," says Dave, "Peo-
ple are just too caught up on
semantics——they feel they have to
label us with some limiting term like
rockabilly." '

The Blasters’ music is ”American
Music” as their song of the same

isn't any music business there. Sure,‘
it's healthier than it was before, but
nothing happens there. For example,

we could never play the Stanley

there. There just isn't any support for

you in Pittsburgh."

But Grushecky sees Pittsburgh as a
good starting point. "Playing the
Decade was good for us, we could go
there and play new songs, and test
them out: But we want to expand.”

As far as the new record (Blooilon the
Brirks) goes, Grushecky is real happy. ‘
"Right now it's too-early to tell how r
well it's doing, but it looks real solid. l
love the new record. You know, '
when you're working on ‘a record it
takes on a life of its own, and this is
the record I wanted to make. Steve
Cropper (guitarist extraordinaire,
and co-author of such classics as
"Dock of the Bay") will definitely pro-
duce the next album."

For a band that took its name from
a local beer, and gets its inspiration
from Pittsburgh (Carson Street,
steel mills etc.) Grushecky doesn't
seem worried about losing his Pitts—y
burgh connection. ''I'm not worriecfiaj
about selling out or anything like
that," said Grushecky, who then
promised to get back to us, with the
latest word on how the tour's going.

Calling all the way from L.A., Pitts~

burgh must have seemed far away, if
not on another planet. During his
whirlwind tour of the west coast,

‘ GHOSTS IN THE
MACHINE

The Police

A&M

When I first heard'"Every Lit-
tle Thing She Does Is Magic" on
an AM radio station a few

. weeks ago, I thought to my-

self, ”lt's so good, it'll never be a
hit." But, at this very moment
I'm b.eing proved wrong—again.

' I also swore that ”Don't Stand

So Close To Me" and ”Message
In A Bottle" would never make
it to commercial radio, but to my
disbelief, not to mention
delight, they did!
Somehow the Police had
managed to become one of the
elite bands who have the advan-
tage of being accepted by both
the AM and FM audience,unlike
the Clash for example, who've
never been able to make that
cross—over. But the most unus-
ual thing about this situation is
the observation that since the
release of their first album, Out-
landos D’/lmour, the Police have
actually been ‘less and less
commercial-oriented. Outlandos
,was chock-full of three
minutes-or-less rockers like
”Next To You,” ”Can’t Stand
Losing You," "Truth Hits Eve-

 

rybody,” and, of course, ”Rox-
anne." But Regatta tie Blanr and
Zenyatta Monalatfa contained only
one or two singles (potentially)

apiece, yet they firmly estab- 

lished the Police as one of the
few remaining"supergroups"in
the world. And Ghost In The
Machine, the band's latest effort,
will only add to their status.
Like all of its predecessors,
Ghosts is a stunning albumthat’s

' sure to be a huge success despite

the fact that there is little mate-
rial here that can be used for

     

', it .

singles. It makes you wonder
how the Police manage, album
after album, to steadily improve
on an already good thing.

The same sort of musical

lushness so evident on Zenyat-ta «

Mondatta is present here in songs
like "Spirits In The Material
World," ”Invisible Sun," and
"Darkness." Though it might be
ridiculous to try and select one
or two songs as "the best"--
considering they're all so
good——”Invisible Sun" and ”Too
Much Information" shine just a

little more brightly than the

rest. ”lnvisible Sun" is a slow,
methodic number that should

serve as a guide to all the new
groups who try to capitalize on
the hypnotic hooks of old Roxy
Music.

The band members them-
selves, needless to say, are in top
form. Stewart Copeland's
signature—style drumming is
especially strong on Ghosts, par-
.ticularly on ”One World (Not

I Three)" and ”Too Much Info-r-

mation." Andy Summers con-
tinues to be the most silent
member of the band in appear-
ance (interviews usually
emphasize Copeland and Sting)
but an equally talented one,
whose swirling guitar is an inte-
gral part of the "Police Sound."
Sting's matinee-idol looks aside,
he remains as the unofficial
leader of the band, due not only
to the fact that he's the singer,
but because he's the main
songwriter as well. All but two
of the numbers of Ghosts are-
Sting compositions, the other

two written by Copeland ("Dar-

kness") and Summers (Omega-

man").

In an interview printed about

a year ago, the Police said that
although they liked each other
and what they were doing, they
didn't think they'd stay together

as a band past a fifth or sixth .

album. After listening to Ghosts
In The Machine I can only hope
that they'll re-evaluate that
thought. There appears to be
alot of talent yet to be

THIS IS THE WAY
The Rossington-Collins Band
MCA Records

Those who were looking for a
Lynyrd Skynyrd revival from

the Rossington-Collins Band.

will be disappointed by their
new album. This Is The Way
shows that R—C Band are look-
ing to the future ‘instead of the
past.

There are a wide variety of
songs on the new album. Two
seem to stand out the most: ”I'm

, Free Today" and ”Pine Box."
”l'm Free Today" is an acoustical
interlude written and sung by
Barry Harwood, while ”Pine
Box" is a chorus song dealing
with death sung without any

backup instruments-. Both of
these numbers are different
from the music on their first
album, /lnytime, /ln_1/plate, /lay-
where, and from Lynyrd Skynyrd
music in general. This might
reflect a major change in the
musical interests of the band,
which could be due to the influ-
ence of Barry Harwood and
Dale Krantz, both of whom
were not part of Lynyrd
Skynyrd.

All the southern rockers were
not forgotten by the Rossing-
ton-Collins Band, though. They
still have plenty of songs on this
album for you to rock to.

.COUI’ DE GRACE
Mink DeVille
Atlantic

Mink DeVille fans expecting
Willie DeVille to rock out on his
new album Coup De Grate are
going to be disappointed. Most
of the songs are ballads, full of

girls and guys andall the stuff ' I

heartbreaks are made of. Willie
is firmly rootedhin the past, and
this record proves it.

DeVille’s soulful voice carries
the ballads with ease, but the
rockers lack ex-lead guitarist
Louis X. Erlanger's driving
'gunslinger' style. Nothing here
is going to blast you out of exist-
ence, like ”One Way Street" or
”Cadillac Walk" from Cabretta,
their first effort.

Coup De Grate is DeVille’s soft-
er sid. his R&B roots,‘ and in
that, its successful. Standouts
are ”]ust Give Me One Good
Reason" and ’’So In Love Are
We." ”]ust Better Move On," an
old standard the Rolling Stones
covered on Deremlrers Children,
gets a latin treatment here, and
is one of the best songs on the
album.

This is a good record. If you
want to bang your head, go
listen to Van Halen. If you want
some soul, listen to Mink.

SONGS IN THE ATTIC
Billy Joel

Columbia

Finally. Finally. Billy Joel has
released those little-known songs
that made him deserving of his
title as one of the world’s best
songwriters in the first place.
Finally, people who thought that

Billy Joel could only write
moronic sehtick like “its Still
Rock-n-Roll To Me” will hear
real Billy Joel music--music with
power and conviction; music
that‘s both soothing and fiery and
it‘s even done live. Songs In The
Attic is a single album compila-
tion of live songs that were for-
merly on Joel's lesser known Cold
Spring Harbor (his very first
album), Piano Man. Turnstiles,

and Streetlife Serenade albums.“

If one ignores the naively ego-
_centric liner notes found on prac-
tically every inch ofthe album and
goes straight to the music the feel-
ing. l‘m sure, the feeling will be
surprisingly mutual. Though few
people know it. Joel’s vintage

years lay in these four albums. The A

time period that these songs cover
were Joel’s hungry years and the
lyrics ring of a piercing truth that
seems to be lost with the coming of
an artist‘s fame. The implications
are sadly ironic but nonetheless
usually true. One won’t find the
anger and frustration of“Captain
Jack” or the spontaneity of

' “Miami 2()l7" on any cutoff of

Glass Houses or even 52 Street.
Sure. the songs were recorded in
1980 but despit some “bell—bottom
dust" the fire of these songs burns
as bright as ever. Just see if you
can resist singing the falsettoes on
“Say (ioodbye To Hollywood” or
the chorus to “The Ballad of Billy
The Kid"... It’s hard. So, forthe
J oelmaniae who can't find enough
bootlegs or the newcomer who
realizes that Billy Joeljust doesn't
make it with “a skinny tie". try
Songs In The Attic-—it’s where the
truth is kept.

DANGEROUS
ACQUAINTANCES
Marianne Faithful
Island

Another 60's relic who clam-
mered up from the basement
last year, Marianne Faithfull
emerged with the brillant Broken
English, a starkly beautiful
album that surprised everyone‘
who had previously thought of
her as little more than ”that girl
who lived with Mick Jagger."
Dangerous /lrquaintances, her new
release, firmly establishes
Faithfull as one of the best tal-
ents of the 80's.

It's still hard to believe that
this is the same woman who
sang fluff like ”As Tears Go By,”
and "Come Stay With Me." As
evidenced in Broken English, her
voice is now rough and deep,
but lends itself perfectly to her
style-the word "style" must be
emphasized, for Faithfull is one
of a handful of artists whose
style is completely her own.
Though her voice sometimes

\

...v  ..
- .  .» ~-

cracks in the middle of a song, it

doesn't detract from the
number at all, in fact, it seems to
enhance it.

Faithfull's songwriting tal-
ents can't be ignored, either—
she wrote or co—wrote all of the
material here except for a single
song. Her lyrics have changed

somewhat from last year; there A

seems to be more hope and
determinism now: "Szveetlzeart—
l'm rlmnging my role in life/l'm not
rearranging the main things in my
life/l ain't sarrifiring what l hold as
true/l ain't sarrifiring, sweetheart,
even for _i/on" (”Sweetheart").

Dmigerous /irijimintnnres is the
limulwlozvii winner in the female
musir mtegory. A/love over Stevie and
Clirissie.

WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN

While I was listening to the

realized that people always

other words, Diana Ross makes

great background music, but
don't count on anything deep.

lcan't help getting the feeling
that Diana Ross makes her
albums in about 45 minutes, yet
she always comes up with ter-
rific stuff. It isn't fair, of course,
but what's fair in this world
anyway? Diana Ross can pro-
duce great albums without even
trying, so why bother?

And she didn't bother in this
album, but it is terrific (any-
way). Songs like"Endless Love,"
this one without Lionel Ritchie,
which is just as well, hit number
one on the charts with a bullet,
and you can count on ”Why Do
Fools Fall In Love" on doing just
the same.

I swear this woman was a
superstar in 1964 (that was 17
years ago folks!) and she still is
one. Oh well, I'm not even going
to worry about it, I'll just listen
to Why Do Fools Fall ln Love and
enjoy superstardom. What else
can I do?

RAGE IN EDEN
Ultravox
Chrysalis

Ultravox is yet another band
from England (otherwise
known as ”The Country With
The Most Musicians Per Square
lnch") with roots somewhere in
this new Romantic (Blitz?)
phase. Their music is very elec-
tronic, perhaps even monoch-
ronic, but interesting just the
same.

Ultravox doesn't write the
same things that everybody else‘
does; when they write about
love, it's not about its joyous
side, but about how consuming
it is. This isn't ”fun" music in
any sense—in fact, it's mourn-
ful and reflective. Take the lyr-
ics to ”We Stand Alone" for
example: We'll soldier on until the
end ngiiiii/Tliis rlutrliing hand aronml
my heart so pitiful and {mil/l\/laltes‘
lileeiling liearts lrent iigiiiii/Westmul in
H «lift-erent light tlintl rust upon/Tlzis
gigolo tlllll gigolette..." Depressing?
Perhaps, but the tone for "We
Stand Alone," and for the entire
album in general, seems to be
one of calm a ccepta nce --
acceptance of tragic love, and of
things that can't be changed.

There are quite a few good

songs on .Rnge In Eden-—”l
Remember,” "Stranger
Within," and ”Your Name Has
Slipped My Mind Again" to
name a few-—to make it worth
the money, especially if you're
up for something different.

HALL AND OATES
Private Eyes
RCA

Those blue-eyed wonders Daryl
Hall and John Oates are at it
again. Private Eyes is another
fluffy foray into the pop music
world of make believe, with 11
catchy songs, any of which
could be their millionth hit of
the week, and none of which
could manage to stay on your
mind ten seconds after it is over.
If you like this kind of stuff(and

. who doesn't) nobody does it bet-

ter than Hall and Oates.

For the record, the title song,
"Head Above Water" and ’’I
Can't Go For That (No Can
Do)” are the best cuts.

There is, of course, an art
form to all of this and one day
somebody will write a "how—to"
book about writing hit pop

songs. Expect a lot of quotes -

from Hall and Oates.

LIVE SHOTS
Ioe Ely
MCA

It was once said of rock ’n roll
bands that some are here to
merely entertain the tourist
(those to whom music was
nothing more than one of those
phases of life that falls some-
where after doing drugs and
before cheating on your wife).
After my first look at Joe Ely, I
knew he was among the ranks
of the precious few, a native
rocker! Born & bred in Lubbock,
Texas, Ely’s sound embodies
country, blues, rockabilly and
some "Sweet Soul" with an
enthusiasm reminiscent of that
other good 'ole boy from Lub-
bock, Buddy Holly. ]oe El}/, Live
Shots captures that sound at its
best, live in small clubs where it
can be filtered through the smo-

key stench that accompanies
such gigs.

The material is taken from
Ely’s 1980 stint through Eng-
land in which he opened for

none other than The Clash. Z

Nuances in style aside, it must
have been ’ an incredible bill
’cause Live Shots contains some
incredible music. Nothing fancy
mind you, in fact all you ama-
teurs could probably grind some
of it out if you could ever tune
the damn guitar. Highlights
among the fourteen tunes,
including four that come via a
complementary 45 titled ”Texas
"Special/’ are ”Fingernails,” tra-
veling music in the vein of Elvis
hits like ”Mystery Train" and
”Promised Land," and ”Long
Snake Moan” which showcases
some great blues guitar work by
Jesse Taylor. Other songs
worthy of particular mention
are Hank Williams’ ”Honky
Tonkin” in which Ely gets some
nice assistance from Carlene
Carter, and the archetypical
”Not Fade Away.” Holly's influ-
ence is most evident in Ely’s
quivering falsetto that rings
true throughout the album.
Live Shots is a must for all

native rockers and recom-‘

mended to anyone who would
still rather watch Hee Haw than
the Solid Gold dancers.

MOODY BLUES
Civic Arena
Nov. 1

By TODD ERKEL

I haven't felt this way since
Polanski's Tess and the best
description of that likened it to
a three hour heroin trip. The
Moody Blues concert at the
Civic Arena wasn't quite three
hours long but it felt like an
eternity sitting there amongst
the most subdued (picture
11,000 of the .‘3tepfar'il Wiv¢*.~‘)
crowd listening two the most
polite (they introduced every
songwith”thanl<you,we'dlike
to carry on with...”) band I have
ever witnessed. The five

(when the

 

  MOODY BLUES

made their mark in the late six-
ties and early seventies with an
impressive string of hits. ludg—
ing from the age of the
audience, this is exactly what
they came to hear. Credit the
band, for they provided all of
their hits, ”Tuesday After-
noon," ”lsn't Life Strange,"
"Question" among others, and
the CFOWCI seerneiz’ happy, butl
really couldn't tell.

The problem with the show,
especially the first hour, was
that the pacing flowed like a
Berlitz School languagerecord

(e.g. song—intro—song-intro). .

Things did pick up nearthe end
introductions
became expendible and the
vocals were taken over by Jus-

tin Hayward whoseistrength is
still impressive after
years.

All in all, the l\/loody Blues
did what they do best and did it
in a sizeable lot performing
over twenty songs. The musi-

man_v

cianship was tight but a little V

too dependent on the wall of
keyboards evident in most
n u in hers.

I still leftthe concert with the
feeling that I had just seen
"ELO goes to "college" and the
combination of pretty lyrics,
backed by pretty pictures
(courtesy of a back screen)
was enough to make a cynical
realist like myselfwantto puke.
But then again, if you're into
Heroin trips.....?

FOREIGNER

FOREIGNER/BILLY SQUIRE
Civic Arena
-October 23. 1981

By GEORGE HOLZER

When I looked at my tickets
and saw that they were for
second row seats on the floor, I
knew I was in for a rough night.
Sure, they were great seats, but
I was sure people wouldn't stay
seated. Billy Squier and For-
eigner are not sit—down bands.

My beliefs came true almost
as soon as the lights dimmed

...oo::: and the introduction for Squier

oO::: .oOO:. started. Instantly people were

( V . .:::.o:::::oO::. on their feet and charging the
.¢oO:::. OO:::.o0O. front. I ended up in the front,

°...O0‘°... 9°:..:OO smashed against the wall, but

. - t S O ‘:0 zz. my feeling of being squashed
'3 C O OO_ wasiswept away by the loud,

solid rock and roll now pouring
out of the soundcsystem. Billy
Squier, in his second Pittsburgh
appearance, again did an admir-
able job. Opening the show was
his best number "In The Dark.’f
Other greats were ”Rich Kid"
and ”The Stroke,” which went
over much better on the
younger Foreigner crowd than
on the Benatar audience Squier
played to in July. Billy Squier
showed once more that he is on
his way to bigger and better

places.
When it comes to being in the
right place though, nobody

beats Foreigner. They rocketed
into the top of the rock scene
with their self-entitled debut
album. They were headlining
large halls before their second
album was even released. But
their third album, Head Carries,
saw them aiming lower than the
first two. They were now aim-
ing at the fourteen—year old
school kids, very disappointing
to those of us who had watched
them start their climb.‘

With 4 I was again disap-
pointed but I decided to cover
the concert anyway. Not a bad
decision, considering that For-
eigner's stage show has kept
them from falling into musical
mediocrity. As they were blast-
ing through a set of their most
popular songs I had a hard time
believing they had put out the
last two albums. ”Cold As Ice,”
”Feels Like The First Time,"
”Blue Morning,” "Dirty White
Boy/’...they were all there.
Each one done with more

energy than the last;-I thought’. 
..they would never tire, but, they

did and off the stage they went.
The audience, not yet satisfied
called them back for two
encores. The first was "Hot
Blooded," and the second was
”Head Knocker.”

As sure as I guessed it, Squier
and Foreigner were not sit-
down bands. But with all the
energy they put out, I couldn't
blame the crowd for being on
their feet the whole show.
