Fraternity housing

By John Gambesda
The Pitt News

The move by eight of Pitt‘s frater-
nities into new surroundings on Uni-
versity Drive this fall is being
interpreted by some as an invest-
ment in the long—term viability ofthe
university’s Greek system.

Harry Kunselman, president of
Sigma Chi, said that he was appre-
hensive at first that the university’s
control over the housing would be so
strong that the fraternities would fail
to function as they should.

“However, I [now] believe the uni-
versity is sincere in its effort to keep
the Greek system alive at Pitt. The

 

new complexes will really do wond-
ers for many fraternities that have
been on the downhill in regard to
their houses.

“I see it as a type of rebirth for the
fraternities, but one that will take
some time to mature."

The fraternities have entered into
a housing project with the university
that will divide costs for the eight
complexes on a one-fourth/three-
fourths basis respectively. Total cost
for each complex is $450,000.

Although the university will actu-
ally own the complex, it has agreed
to contract a 99-year lease with each
fraternity, granting them exclusive
use of the units.

Each unit has a maximum student
occupancy of 25. The fraternity has

they cannot fill every room with a

right to fill the vacancy with a non-
Greek student.

The three-story complexes line
University Drive on the northwest
side of Pitt Stadium. The first floor
of each unit includes a dining room,
kitchen, party room, chapter room,
billiard room and a bedroom
designed for a handicapped student.

On the second floor, there are six
double bedrooms, bathrooms and
storage areas, while the third floor
contains the same number of bed-
rooms and a laundry and equipment

Rabbi calls

Prof: food a

By Alison Sterne
For The Pitt News

The only way to stop the constant
testing and deployment of nuclear
weapons is through a nuclear freeze,
but many Jewish groups are not
actively working toward that goal,
according to Rabbi David
Sapperstein. I »

“The notion that we can control
our destiny is desperately needed
now,” he said. Sapperstein, co-
director of the Religious Action
Center in Washington, D.C., spoke
here Friday in a lecture entitled
“Jewish Responses to the Nuclear
Arms Race,” sponsored by the Pitt
Hillel Club.

Sapperstein said he was very con-
cerned with the lack of participation
by many national Jewish ‘organiza-
tions in the nuclear freeze
movement.

“Jews have the most atstake in the
ongoing horizontal proliferation of
nuclear weapons, [but] the Jewish
community is disproportionally
involved.”

He said many Jewish organiza-
tions are not concentrating on the
freeze as much as they could be.
Some of these organizations, he
said, are apprehensive because they

Zeta Beta Tau, Sigma Chi, Delta
Tau Delta and Phi Kappa Theta will
occupy the first four units. Pi Kappa
Alpha and Theta Chi will be housed
just above the first four and occupy
units five and six. Above them are
units seven and eight, which have
been leased by Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Delta Sigma Delta.

Since the inception of the com-
plex idea three years ago, there have
been mixed emotions among frater-
nity members about whether the
new houses would really work.
However, as the move-in date
approaches and the members begin

The United States has a more
powerful weapon than nuclear

Pitt history professor Dr. Robert
Colodny said Friday.

In his lecture entitled “The
Way the World is Going: Illusion
and Reality,” which was spon-
sored by the Pitt International
Affairs Forum, Colodny said the
U.S. and its monopoly as a food
exporter could give it a measure
of power it never had before.

Washington, D.C. could
acquire virtual life-and—death
power over the fate of the multi-
tudes of the needy,” he said.

Colodny charged the mass a
media with presenting the world
in a “manner that trivializes both
present politics and past his-
tory.” The problems the world
faces today are much too impor-
tant to be handled so lightly, he
said.

Coldony admitted, however,
that this is a dark period in
America’s national history.

- “If this be a night of destiny,"
he told the audience, “then
blessed be it ‘til comes the dawn.”

A ‘‘I’m really happy about the whole
idea,” said Jim Haug, a student
government board member and
treasurer of Pi Kappa Alpha. “It will
surely enhance brotherhood in a
way not experienced by our'Greek
system ever before.

“We are now more in the stream-
line of campus» activity, and our
position in relation to Pitt Stadium
and Trees Hall couldn't be better,”
Haug said.

The Greek system has been a part
of the university since 1863, with the

Council, which directs the houses in
campus and university affairs.
Bridget Guernsey, assistant direc-
tor of student activities, is the offi-
cial liaison between the university
and the Greeks. It is herjob to see to
it that all uriversity policies, as well
as those of the council, are followed.
\ “I think the complexes are in the
best interest of the fraternities and
that they will be a real plus in a,
number of ways,” Guernsey said.
“By working in cooperation with
housing and the university, the fra-
ternities will still be able to govern
themselves according to their own
policies. It may take a while for ever-
yone to become accustomed, but I’m
sure it will work out in the end.”
Andy Smith, director of student

movement would affect American
attitudes toward Israel or Jewish
immigration from the Soviet Union.

Sapperstein added that the fear
that supporting the freeze would
jeopardize progress in these areas is
unfounded and that his organization
is doing everything in its power to
change this perception.

“This is a unique time,” Sapper-
stein said. “There has been a biparti-
san international consensus for 20
years that more is better.”

During this time, he said, govern-
ment officials believed that increas-
ing the quality and quantity of
nuclear weapons was the way to go.

This deterrence method has

become so dangerous that the very‘

people who developed the idea that
“more is better" are now reassessing
that position. ‘

Moreover, public opinion is also
changing. According to Sapper-
stein, 75 percent of the Jewish com-
munity is in favor ofa nuclear freeze.

“There are only a certain number
of issues the American public can
focus on at one time,” he said, “so it
is fortunate that there has been a
convergence between public interest
and this period of government
reassessment.”

This gives everyone the opportu-
nity to help shape future policies on
the nuclear arms race, he added.

there have been two major -
reforms in the nuclear freeze move-
ment in recent years, Sapperstein
said. The movement originally‘
opted to freeze not only testing and
deployment, but also production.
However, when the movements
leaders realized arms production in
the Soviet Union could not be prop-
erly monitored, the idea was

The second and most profound
change, Sapperstein said, was the
decision to bypass President Rea-
gan, who opposes a freeze, and to
approach Congress directly. Con-
gress alone could pass a temporary, ;
unilateral freeze by cutting off all ‘r;
money for nuclear arms for a certain ti
period of time. If the Soviets fol-
lowed suit, the freeze would be
extended. Such a‘ freeze, he said.
would allow U.S.-Soviet arms nego-
tiations to take place without having
to be concerned with on-going test-
ing and deployment. This was a sig-
nificant problem during the SALT
II talks, he said.

stein said, “man has been able to
make mistakes and even repeat
them, yet he still was able to grow

Too Little  
  Too Late

Last week’s action by the Environmental Protection Agency
, to limit use of the controversial pesticide ethylene dibromide
(EDB) is a welcome but overdue and misleading episode in the
Reagan Administrations environmental soap opera.
Several states (California, Florida and Wisconsin) took it
' upon themselves to do what the Reagan Administration had
refused to by requiring store owners to remove EDB—treated
products from their shelves. The Environmental Protection
Agency finally responded to scientific evidence showing the
cancer-causing effects of EDB by banning its use in breads,
raw, processed- and cooked-grain products. ‘ _
The ruling, however, does not call for the destruction of
EDB-treated grains that are instorage or for a recall of EDB
products already in supermarkets. Nor does the ban stop the
export-of citrus proucts to Japan or the import offruit from the
Caribbean, much of which is treated with EDB.
In a briefing on the new ruling, EPA administrator William
Ruckelhaus said the ruling would only provide a partial reduc-

‘_ tion in EDB exposure and added that it was unreasonable to

expect a “zero-risk" of exposure to carcirogens. Ruckelhaus’
explanation of why stricter guidelines weren’t employed indi-
cated that to do so would cause unpleasant “dislocations” in the

- economy.

The overriding considerations for industrialists is a new
attitude for Ruckelhaus. His new pro—business position may be
due to a fear for his job should the president win re-election. In
September, Ruckelhaus called for a complete ban on EDB. But
industry officials called for and recieved a review of the deci-

sion, effectively tabling the ban.

In this election year, Reagan is going to use this and other
makeshift solutions to try to woo votes. Reagan’s policies have
-consistently favored profits over people. This ruling is an inef-
fectual, politically motivated piece of legislation, and it is
bound to be highly touted by Reagan on the campaign trail.

Pitt Student;

  give us the

business

According to the description of
the media communications major, it
is intended to “...meet the needs and
interests of persons who are engaged
in- oriaspire to careers that employ
competency in communicating
through print or other media.”
Unfortunately, not only does it fail
to meet these objectives. the Dresent

curriculum does little toprepare the
student for any vocation or
profession. I _

Communication and information
handling is by far the fastest growing
and most viable industry in America
today.

Entry-level employment in com-4

munication inevitably requires a
rudimentary knowledge or ‘expe-
rience in digital information pro-
cessing. Virtually all entry-leveljobs
in broadcasting are in the field of
production. Newspapers hire jour-
nalism majors. Why is it then that
the media communications major at
the University of Pittsburgh consists
of virtually two-thirds journalism
and communications theory and

only a token preview of media pro-
duction and communications tech-
nology? Beyond this point, students
are not allowed to take courses in
business and marketing which are

absolutely required for any hope of

attaining a management position.

The solutions to the problems and
deficiencies of the media communi-
cations major are straightforward.
To start, three new courses must be
established: audio and video pro-
duction, broadcast writing, and
intro to communications technol-
ogy.

Although worthwhile for
teachers, it cannot provide the “real
world” experience necessary for stu-
dents to become competitive in the
marketplace of communications.
Finally, the prospective graduate
should be required to take at least
two courses in management and
marketing to complete degree
requirements.

These criticisms are not meant to
be so much a condemnation as they
are intended to express a hope for
the future concert‘ of academia and
industry. We must remember Aris-
totle, but we must compete with Ted
Turner. -

Obesity no
little matter

I was very pleased to see Nancy
Popkin’s article on bulimia (“Binge
— Purge") in the Jan. 30 issue of The
Pitt News.

I would like to point out that
Overeaters Anonymous (O.A.) is
another resource for people who
have this problem. Most people who
join 0A are those whose eating dis-

order is a food obsession that mani- '

fests itself in compulsive overeating
and obesity. However, over the 24
years that OA has been in existence,
increasing numbersofanorexics and
bulimics have found strength, hope
and recovery in this twelve-step pro-
/ .
gram. Many people find that the
underlying problem, a food obses-
sion, is the same, whether it mani-

fests itself in obesity, starving,
vomiting or excessive use of
laxatives.

There are approximately 90
separate groups of Overeaters A-
nonymous in the Pittsburgh area.

  A Central View/ Nicolas Sheon and Anna Dietzsch

Sandinistan government opens door for freedom

Editor 's note: This is the second in
a series submitted to The Pitt News
by members of the Central America
Mobilization Coalition. The coali-
tion is a locally-based anti- U. S.-
intervention group. Nicolas Sheon is
a junior from Shadyside Academy.
Anna Dietzsch is a senior from
Allderdice High school.

There is a growing opposition to
U.S. militarism‘ in Central America.

t'However, many of us feel powerless

to prevent our policy makers from
sending more guns and tanks to this
area. Most of us are honest enough
to admit to ourselves that we know
very little about the situation in this
war-torn area. I

Some of us have felt the need to
learn more about Central America.
Perhaps in response to this, about 40
people attended a slide show about
Nicaragua last month. The slide
show was given by two Pittsburgh
residents, Andy Hope and Andy
Tobin, who recently returned from a
tour of Nicaragua. The lecture and
discussion clearly revealed how the
American media are showing a dis-
torted picture of the issues now fac-
ing the people of Central America.

Both men had talked to scores of
Nicaraguans, hearing from both
critics and supporters of the Sandi-
nista government. The speakers
were left with the impression that the
people have benefitted enormously
under the Sandinista government.
The workers, small businessmen and
farmers have no reason to regret the
sacrifices they made to achieve the
overthrow of the dictator Somoza in
l979.

Our media have made a fuss about
Sandinista censorship of opposition
newspapers. Towlin explained-that
the government has loosened its cen-
sorship. Newspapers are forbidden
to publicize military information
and economic data that could lead
to hoarding or price speculation.

Ironically, the only place in Nica-
ragua that cannot be photographed
is inside the American Embassy.
Hope told how when American vis-
itors were invited to dine there, their
cameras were confiscated and later
were returned with the film exposed.

The Sandinistas have recently
decided to allow the repatriation of
political opponents who fled the
country after the Somoza over-
throw. The government opens its

arms to these people, confident that
if they were given a chance to expe-
rience the system, they would accept
it and even like it. The rich land-
owners in exile can have their land
back as long as they pledge to keep it
cultivated.

Businessmen can start up their
factories as long as they reinvest
their profits in Nicaragua.

The Sandinistan government has
made gains in increasing the general‘
welfare. Tobin described a huge reli-
gious celebration he witnessed in
Managua. The government, know-
ing that poor families could not buy
gifts for all their children, decided to
buy and distribute toys. The right to
an education has been made possible
for all Nicaraguans no matter how
poor they are. For example. Hope
visited a medical school whose
semester tuition is in the price range
of two bottles of beer.

The government has built 26 cul-
tural learning centers where anyone
can develop his artistic talents at no
cost. The centers emphasize the
importance of keeping up the
national culture and traditions that
are unique to Nicaragua. The
government has emphasized com-

munity involvement in the arts to
help the people get rid oftheir fear of
personal expression that developed
during the Somoza regime. Before
the ‘revolution, hundreds of the
nation’s artists and thinkers.were
killed, tortured or forced into exile
for expressing opposition to Somo-
za through their art.

In this country art is no longer a
luxury only for the elite to produce
and consume but a vehicle ofexpres-
stonqfort everyone regardless of his
economic level.

In truth, the militarism now so
apparent among these people has
not spawned out oflove of war but is
a response to threats from a super
power to overthrow the people's
revolutionary government. The
strong will of the ‘Nicaraguans to
defend the gains they accomplished
with the revolution is clearly shown
by their massive involvement in
voluntary government activities.

The people‘s militia is an organi-

zation made up of civilians who
serve anywhere from several months
to a year, patrolling the border, dis-

tributing supplies and doing other
tasks to help the government.

The tremendous popular support
for the militia is shown by the
number of people who are part of
nationalorganizations such as the
volunteer work brigades, youth and
women‘s organizations and the
worker’s unions.

Does democracy exist in Nicara-
gua? Tobin met with an activist from
the national women's organization
who attempted to answer this ques-
tion. She said that Nicaraguans had
no democracy before the overthrow
of Somoza, adding “How could we
(Nicaraguans) have democracy
when more than half of our people
could not read or write?" With the
literacy rate now at 88 percent, Nica-
raguans have gained the confidence
to participate in democratic forms.

The woman went .on to explain
how government subsidies keep
food prices the lowest in Central
America. People are not afraid of
their employers, the police or their
landlords. They will not land injail if
they stand up for their rights. The
non-existence of political repression
encourages democracy.

Modern composers featured

Ensemble promotes ne

By Sam Blancato
The Pitt News

V Center

Do modern composers have a
niche in our society‘? According to
David Stock, director and conduc-

'tor of the Pittsburgh New Music

Ensemble, they don’t.
Most fine arts radio stations, with

a few exceptions, such as Pitts- ‘

burgh‘s WQEMD, play classical music
written by composers who lived and
died before the light bulb was
invented and give very little airplay
to the works of living composers.
The repertoire offered by American
orchestras originates mainly from a
narrow slice of European culture
between I800 and 1900, Stock
explained. '
The works ofcomposers like Bee-
thoven, Brahms and Mozart are
what the average concertgoer has
come to expect, and anything writ-
ten within the last 70 years is treated
largely with indifference, he said.
According to Stock, the Pitts-
burgh New Music Ensemble is ded-
icated to the belief tliat “all
composers did not die I00 years ago
in Germany.” The group strives suc-
cessfully to promote the music ofthe
modern composer. In addition to
performing twentieth-century clas-

sics by composers such as» Aaron '

Copeland, Charles Ives, and Igor
Stravinsky, the ensemble has pre-
miered over 35 new works, some of
which were written especially for the
ensemble’s unique talents. It and

and that composition is its most
essential element.

Depending on the piece to be per-
formed, five to fifteen musicians
make up the Pittsburgh New Music

Ensemble, combining brass, strings, ‘

voice, Woodwinds, percussion and
electronics. All of the musicians are
members of the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony and other symphonies in the
tri-state area. They are graduates of
Carnegie—Mellon University, the
Julliard School, Duquesne Univer-
sitsy, Oberlin College and Witten-
burg University, and they all serve
on the faculties of music schools
around the area.

The ensemble measures its success
on the number and quality ofits con-
cert performances and the aesthetic
diversity of the pieces it plays,

according to Stock. Some of the

ensemble‘s many accomplishments.

are appearances on National Public
Radio, a debut at New York’s Car-
negie Hall in I981 and joint perfor-
mances with the Pittsburgh Dance
Alloy since I979.

Director and conductor Stockhas
had his own compositions per-
formed throughout the United
States and Europe and on the CR]
record label. The ensemble has
received funding from the National
Endowment for the Arts to perform
and record compositions by com--
posers such as Pulitzer Prize winner
Dr. Ellen Zwilich.

A Pittsburgh New Music Ensem-
ble performance can take place any-
where from a concert —- hall to a
neighborhood festival. The music
the group plays is as rich and com-

: plex as music from the age of Napo-

leon but composed by people who.
are alive today with a spirit that
reflects our own age.

The ensemble will give a free con-
cert on Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. at the
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium. It will
perform compositions written by
graduate students there at Pitt’s
music school. When performing at
Pitt, the ensemble has a policy of
playing works written by resident
students at Pitt’s music school.‘

Moreover, 90 percent of. the
ensembles repertoire is American.
According to Stock, it is essential
that the ensemble support American
talent. He said the work of the Pitts-
burgh «New Music Ensemble is
important because it is reestablish-
ing a place in our society for the
living composer.

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

The National Collegiate Athletic
Association voted in its annual con-
vention last month to establish a 44-
member body of presidents to better
deal with problems afflicting colle-
giate sports.

By passing Proposal 36 on the
convention agenda, the meeting par-
ticipants resoundingly defeated a
move by the American Council on
Education.» The council sponsored
Proposal 35, would have given the
commission power to suspend
NCAA rules a‘nd'impose any regula-
tions on NCAA members.

Proposal 36 lends the association
authority to propose legislation and
control procedures at subsequent

conventions. The body of presidents .

can also designate study groups and
commissions to make recom-
mendations.

Many delegates said they sensed
that Proposal 35, which needed two-
thirds majority for passage, would
have left too much power in too few
hands — weakening the NCAA‘s

-tradition of one institution, one

vote.

Pitt athletic ‘ director Edward
Bozik said he sees the effects of the
new commission as a positive step.

“Its .an appropriate compromise
position,” Bozik said.

While North Carolina A&T

I Chancellor Edward Fort, in the Jan.

18 issue of The Chronicle of Higher
Education, called “Proposal
36...nothing more than apolitically
contrived, eleventh hour response to

35...suggesting that 36 is an attempt
at co—option," Bozik supported the
commission for its potential impact.

“Part of the contention was —- I
can’t put it any other way ~ a feeling
of distrust on some of the sponsors
of the [American Council on Educa-
tion] legislation who felt, the ADs
[athletic directors] or faculty reps
who went to these conventions were
somehow made captive of athletic
interests, however you define that.”
Bozik explained. “And they really
weren't voting the way perhaps their
presidents wanted them [to, in the
past].”

The Commission will be staffed by
presidents appointed by the nation’s
chief executive officers, such as
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, who will
return mail ballots containing nomi-
nee choices. Presidents will be

elected to one-, two-, three- and.

four-year terms to avoid complete
turnover within the new body after
the maximum four-year term

expires. ‘
Presidents will be more actively
involved in the NCAA without

undermining the basic structure of

the association.

“[It’s a step forward] in the sense
you have a meaningful way, on a
continuing basis, to have presiden-
tial involvement in the NCAA in the
policymakingi structure of the
NCAA,” Bozik said.

Another move in the NCAA was
stalled when the 1,712 delegates
voted against Proposal 37, granting

autonomy. The NCAA‘s most pres-

tigious football programs could
have drafted their own rules in all
areas except championships, subj. st
to two-thirds rejection at following
conventions. ~

After the rejection of Proposal 37
came the rejection of Proposal 38,
which would have allowed Division
I-A schools to have annual meetings
as a group each June. Proposal 38
failed primarily because Division I
basketbaIl—only schools were con-
cerned they would become subordi-
nate to Proposal 37’s domineering
rule-making, according to St. John’s
atheletic director John W. Kaiser, in
the Jan. I8 article of the Chronicle.

Bozik and Pitt faculty representa-
tive John Bolvin voted in favor of
Proposal 37.

“It follows that ifyou‘re Division I
and Division II and Division III,
you’ve [designated the school as
such] because there are common
grounds these schools can meet on
philosophically and economically,”
Bozik said. “Economically, there is a
big difference." _

The schools sought more direc-
tion in controlling their TV cover-
age. “lfyou don’t have those schools

controlling [Division I-A], you’re —

not going to have very good televis-
ion,”Bozik said.

He added, “We coutd set aca-
demic policies for ourselves, which
would probably be more stringent
than otherwise we can impose on the
whole convention.”

Instead, members from the 90
schools will propose and adopt legis-
lation applying only toIDivision I-A
and then forward the resolutions to
the NCAA Council, subject to con-
vention voting.

\

Two days of the Big East winter
meetings in Pittsburgh concluded

ing closer to adopting baseball as a
team sport.

Although the Big East basketball

Ctournament March 7-10 consumed

most of the agenda, the conference
athletic directors convened and
“approved in concept” baseball as a
conference sport.

“We’ll have the final details
worked out in May [during the Big
East spring meeting],“ said Pitt ath-
letic director Edward Bozik.

St. John's athletic director, Jack
Kaiser, led the effort to fully incor-
porate baseball in the Big East.
When adopted, Syracuse will be the

.lone school not carrying the sport.

In other matters, Pitt sold 750 of
the 1,215 tournament tickets it was
alloted for the four-day event to be

.held in Madison Square Garden.

The $55 ticket packages were dis-
tributed to the nine member schools,
the Big East office and to the

Each school distributed its entire
allotment, except Pitt and Villanl
ova, which sold 850. The 830 pack-
ages the two schools returned will be
redistributed.

The ticket plans encompass all of
Madison Square Garden, except for
the mezzanine seats (better known
as blue heaven), which will be sold in
$35 packages.

Each of the conferences nine
schools must also traffic 300 student
tickets at $5 apiece for each tourna-

Panther gymnasts

split at Trees

By Bob Green
The Pitt News

The Pitt men gymnasts suffered
their first defeat of the season in a
tri—meet with Temple and Western
Michigan at Trees Hall on Saturday.

The Broncos of Western Michi-
gan (3-2) took first place (264.0).
while Pitt and Temple grabbed
second (256.6) and third (230.8).
respectively.

The Panthers were forced to com-
pete without the services of senior
all-arounder Frank Kratz. Kratz.
who pulled a muscle in his arm prac-
ticing last Tuesday, is out
indefinitely.

“It was a real tough. tense meet.”
said head coach Frank D’Amico.
“We lack in depth. Frank [Kratz]
was missed on the side horse. That is
where we lost the meet."

In the first event, the floor exer-
cise. Pitt took first on sophomore
Mark Klafter’s 9.6 performance.
Panther senior Dave Smith and
Temple‘s Bob Fleming tied for
second with 9.4.

“There were just too many inju-
ries," Smith said. “Our lack ofdepth
hurt us this week."

In the still rings competition.
Klafter and sophomore Matt Peters
placed first and second. respectively.
posting scores of 9.25 and 9.1.

“I knew the team wouldn‘t be at its
full potential score—wise without
Frank [Krat7],‘? Klafter said.
“Watching Frank gets me psyched
up. Frank was the difference
between this week and last week."

At the halfway point of the meet.
Pitt was down by 4.l5 points to
Western Michigan l28.o5—l24.5.

The Broncos pulled off another
sweep in the vault. Joe Bleau (93),

“Loose and relaxed”is how diving
choach Julian Krug summed up the
Lady Panthers’ 94-46 victory over
Youngstown, which marked their
last home meet- of the dual meet
season. i

“We are usually very intense.”
head coach Dave Belowich said.
“The importance of this meet was to
try people at their second events.
Everybody had a good time.”

Senior Denise Sedlacek, - whose
200-yard freestyle relay team missed
qualifying for Nationals by four
tenths ofa second, was entered in the
one-meter diving event for the first
time in her colletiate career.

“I loved it," said Sedlacek. “It was
a nice way to wind down the end of
the season.”

Senior captains

Margie Cury swam in the last home
regular season meets.

Sedlacek and

Jodi O’Neil

Diver Tricia Schultz made her
first ever attempt at swimming in the
I00-yard freestyle.

Coach Belowich assured that the
team would not have to worry about
competition from Schultz. “We‘re
going to keep her on the boards,” he

‘ said.

The layed back atmosphere at
Saturdays meet was not only a lot of
fun for both teams, but in some
cases, it even contributed to a better
performance.

Diver Tricia Ney qualified for the
NCAA Pre-Qualifiers on both the
one-meter and three—meter boards.
Jennifer Brown has also qualified on
both boards.

‘Pitt beats Friars, tied

for Big East lead

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

“We seemed to have a lot of poise
down the stretch,“ Pitt women’s bas-
ketball coach Judy Saurer said fol-

‘lowing her team's come-from-be-

hind, 81-75 victory over Providence
Saturday night at Fitzgerald Field
House.

The win gives Pitt (I3-8) a handle
on first place in the Big East Confer-
ence, tying the Lady Friars at 4-].

The Lady Panthers, trailing at
intermission and midway through
the second half, shot a meager 55
percent from the foul line in the final
20 minutes.

Despite this, the Pitt players still
managed to once again save them-
selves from defeat with a full-team
effort.

Providence (I6-3) was not
expected to top the conference
under the new-found leadership of
Lynn Sheedy. The Friars achieved a
24-6 tally and second-place in the
championships last March.

First-year coach Sheedy conceded
Pitt’s balanced scoring but did not
hide her disappointment at the
game’s unfolding.

“They’re a good offensive ball
club. We figured they had outside
shooters and could work the ball
inside,” Sheedy said.

“We went out head-to-head and
played man-to-man [defense],”
Sheedy remarked. “We were down
by nine deep in the second half and
made it a two-point game. We have
to have a five-point lead to win, not
one. A few breaks late in the game,
and we could’ve won this ball game."

Pitt's Jennifer Bruce was
exhausted and probably should not
have played the entire 40 minutes

  

.  

A

without a break, according to
Saurer. However, Pitt’s offense is
anchored by Bruce, the Big-East’s
leading scorer with 24.2 points per
game, and she overcame her fatigue.
The six-foot junior ledvthe Lady
Panther's scoring assault with 29
points and eight rebounds.

The poise and experience of play-
ers like Bruce carried the team to
victory, said Saurer. Middle-range
shooters Lisa Fubio (eight points)
and Ellen Gilhooley (8 points, six-
rebounds) and outside shooter and‘
spirit motivator Stephanie Collins,
provided a balanced scoring attack.

Collins‘ accuracy in the second
half approached the unapproacha-
ble: six for six shooting from the
l5-20 foot range and an icy cool five
for five from the foul line in the final
30 seconds of a three-point contest.

“I wasn’t thinking anything
really,” said Collins. “I didn’t think,
‘This is a big shot.’ ljust thought ofit
as_just another shot.”

“Collins is a tremendous shooter,"
Saurer remarked. “l’ve always said
she was the best shooting guard, as
far as form. She was productive
tonight.” Collins scored all of her 17
points in the second half.

Although they encountered little
difficulty breaking the Friars‘ full-
court press, Pitt still trailed on the
scoreboard 40-36 at halftime. The
Lady Panthers needed someone to
set the tone of the game, and guard
Kim Tirik handily responded.

“Tirik changed the tempo of the
game in the second half," Saurer
said.

“Yeah. we picked up the tempo,”
Tirik agreed. “We [began] reversing
the ball and hitting the big person in
the middle.”

Out in front when directing the
offense, Tirik was often located

under the hoop on defense. “We had
two other guards in, so I went low. I
like it back there,” Tirik said. “I can
anticipate passes and seewhere peo-
ple are going."

“We played junk defenses,"
Saurer said. “Some people were
man-to-man, some played zone. It
was hard for Julie Callan to under-
stand what we were doing, which is
unfortunate for her," the coach said,
explaining Callan’s absence in most
of the second half. The freshman
produced 12 points and six
rebounds.

Providence was led by freshman
Doris Sable, who shot l0 for 13 from
the field and six for 10 from the foul
line, in scoring 22 points for the
game. Kathy Finn added 16 points
and nine rebounds, and Britt King
garnered 10 boards.

Colas outstanding
at VMI Relays

By Charlie O’Hara
The Pitt News

For the second year in a row. the
Panther track team has taken full
advantage of its opportunities at the
VMI Winter Relays at the Virginia
Military Institute.

There were no team scores com-
piled, but Pitt competitors placed in
the top six in eight different events.

Middle-distance runner Todd
Colas was named the Outstanding
Track Athlete, marking the second
straight time that a Panther has been
endowed with that honor. Last sea-
son, Roger Kingdom was awarded.

Colas won the l500—meter run in a
personal best indoor time of 3:48.l,
while fellow senior Bill Moorhead
took fourth with 3:55.7. Colas quali-
fied in the l500—meter run for the
lntercollegiate Amateur Athletic
Association of America (lC4A)
championships. ~

He also anchored the victorious
3200-meter (4x800) relay team,
which set a meet record and quali-
fied for the IC4A meet.

Teaming with Alan Laws, Moor-
head and Tim Manes, Colas ran his
leg in l:49.3-the fastest 800-meter
split time ever recorded on the track
at VMI. The team’s time of 7:43.3
also established a meet record.

Colas has now qualified for the
IC4A meet in four events, the I000-
meter run, the I500-meter run, the
distance medley relay and the 3200-
meter relay. He has surpassed the
NCAA championship qualifying
standards in the I000-meter‘ run and
the distance medley relay.

“Todd [Colas] ran a fine I500-
meters, and he was outstanding on

of l:52.6, more than three seconds
faster than his I983 clocking at
VMI.

Other notable Panther finishers
were freshman Alan Laws, who was
fifth (l:06.3) in the 500-meter run,
and junior Rodney Chobany, who
cleared l4—O in the pole vault, which
proved good enough for seventh.

Two other Pitt relay teams placed
in the top six. The all-freshman dis-
tance medley (800x400xl200xl600)
team of Bob Weiner, Jeff Longbot-
tom, Manes and John Thomas fin-
ished fifth (l0:27.5). The
shuttle-hurdle team (4x55-meter
high hurdles) of Bill Lantz, Cho-
bany, Ralph Mitton and Longbot-
tom also took fifth (31.5).

The Panthers competed without
junior hurdler Roger Kingdom, who
went west to the Dallas Times
Herald meet and found the competi-
tion to be a bit stiff. Kingdom placed
sixth with a time of 7.43, his slowest

, clocking of the 1983-84 indoor
season.

Ladies sprint
relay wins

By Dale Moore

The Pitt Lady Panthers track
team may have surprised everyone
except themselves this weekend
when they came away from the
Princeton Invitational as champions

from the competition.

Joining Blake in the relay that
defeated 17 other teams was Edie
Butler, Gail Counts and Renee
Henderson.

Counts and Henderson also com-
peted in the 55-meter dash. In the
finals, Henderson just fell short in
her bid to be a double winner, taking

Panthers in

  must-win
game with  

(.lCOI‘ll‘l

By ‘Mike Slberini
The Pitt News

When the Panther basketball team takes
on the Huskies of Storrs, Conn., in a Big
East contest tonight, they might have some-

‘ ‘ thing else on their minds -— namely, the loss

they suffered ‘to Boston College on
Saturday.

Pitt (ll.-8 overall, 2-7 in the Big East)
controlled the pace of the first 29 minutes of
the game, holding the lead for all. but one
minute of that time. In the final 11 minutes,
however, Gary Williams’ Eagles began to
pick up the pace to outrace the-Panthers to a
72-59 Big East win.

For Pitt guard Bill Culbertson, there was
a three-minute stretch midway through the
second half that sticks out above the rest,
one that he believed was controlled by the
referrees as much as the players. During this
time, Boston College, then down 43-36,
reeled off ll points on five consecutive trips
down the floor.

“It was at the point where we’d get fouled
underneath five times in a row and didn‘t get
the call. Then they go up in the next five
possessions,” Culbertson said. “We came
out ready to win, but those five possessions
killed us.”

Coach Roy Chipman noticed the same
trend but summed it up a little differently.

“It seemed that there was a very key
stretch where everything seemed to go
against us, whether it was a call or a loose
ball. They just seemed to take advantage of

whatever was going on,” he said. “I can’t

blame the game on the officials; l have to
blame the game on us and our team. Wejust
didn‘t execute when we had to execute."

The key to the Pitt loss was simply the fact
that the team’s top three big men (Keith
Armstong, Chip Watkins and Andre Willi-
ams) were all plagued by foul trouble, pick-
ing up three each‘ in the first half. As the
three walked on egg shells in the second half
while being shuffled in and out of the lineup
by Chipman, the Eagles took advantage.
The visitors picked up the tempo and nearly
doubled their first-half production (47
second-half points as compared to 25 in the
opening period). V, I

“We got into foul trouble early, and that
really takes away from our effectiveness,
especially defensively,” Chipman said. “We
had to make a lot of changes, and that hurt
us, Armstrong in particular. When we lost
him, it took away the middle defensively,
and they were able to get a lot of things they
didn‘t in the first half.”

Offensively, the Panthers cooled consid-
erably as the game went on. Near the end of
the first half, they were shooting over 50
percent from the floor but finishedthe open-
ing stanza at .409. Their second-half figure
was ‘even worse - .367.

“During the last 10 minutes, we seemed
willing to just get the ball up and not look for
the easy shot,” Chipman explained.

Now, coming off the tough loss at home,
Pitt must take on Connecticut (1 1-8 overall,
3-6 in the Big East) tonight. For those of you
who remember, the Huskies beat the Pan-
thers by 19 points just one month ago.

In that game at Fitzgerald Field House,
UConn displayed a balanced scoring attack
with four players in double digits. Leading
the way were Roy Broxton and last year’s
Big East Rookie of the Year, Earl Kelley,
with 16 and 20 points, respectively. Eddie
Williams" and Carl Hobbs chipped in 14
each.

As usual, Clyde Vaughan led the Panthers
with 15 counters. More significant for the
first Pitt-UConn game, however, was the
benching of starting guards Cubertson and
George Allen for missing a team breakfast.

The move affected the players in different
ways. Culbertson responded by shooting 50
percent from the floor (his Big East average
is now at 38 percent), while Allen shot a
listless two for 12, 20 percentage points
below his nine-game conference total of 36
percent.

But all that is in the past, and Chipman
and the Panthers are ready for the rematch.

Panther basketball players look on in disbelief during Saturday’s 72-59 loss to Boston College

“I think we’re determined to come back
and play well against Connecticut if we pos-
sibly can,” Chipman said. “I don’t think our
problem has been one of not being ready to
play or being up or down. I think our prob-
lemhas been that we’ve been streaky shoot-
ing the ball, we've made turnovers at key
times in the basketball game, and we’ve had
a lot of fouls."

But besides that, the Panthers are doing
all right.

George Allen

out late,
plays tired

By Joe Zeff
The Pitt News

Pitt guard George Allen committed seven
turnovers, six of them in the first half, in the
Panthers‘ 72-59 loss to Boston College Sa-
turday afternoon.

Coach Roy Chipman pulled Allen in
favor of freshman Curtis Aiken with 2:34
remaining in the game.

“He saidthat I looked like I was tired,"
Allen said.

Allen was seen by this reporter and others
walking the streets of Oakland around I
a.m. on Saturday morning. He was walking
on Forbes Avenue across from David Law-
rence Hall, away from the Cathedral of
Learning.

“I was just thinking about the game, you
know,” Allen said. “I was very excited about
this game. You know, CBS, my mother and
father could see it, so I was very excited, very
emotional, so I did, you know, walk around
a little bit."

Allen explained his late night walk with
his interpretation of Chipman’s curfew.

February. 6, I984

  Robinson
suspended

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
reported today that Pitt sophomore

pended indefinitely from the team
by head coach Dr. Roy Chipman.

The suspension follows an inter-
view with Robinson in The Pitts-
burgh Press Sunday in which the 6-9
transfer from the University of Cin-
cinnati called Chipman a liar. I

Robinson did not play during
Saturday’s 72-59 loss to Boston Col-
lege after playing eight minutes in
last Wednesday’s game against
Providence. He did not accompany ‘
the team to Connecticut for
tonight’s game against the Huskies.

“I’ll tell you, nobody’s more sur-
prised more than me,” Robinson .
said in the Press article. “He just
lied. He doesn’t have to explain.
He’s the chief.” .

Earlier in the season, Robinson
started two consecutive games
against Florida State and Duquesne
before returning to the bench where
he stayed until the Providence game
last week. - ~ ,

Robinson was slated to fill the
hole in Pitt’s game -— the center
position — at the start of the season.

Pitt’s preseason media guide
quoted Chipman as saying,
“...Robinson is potentially as good a
player as we have on the club.”

He was not available for comment
late‘ last night.

“You’ve got to be to bed by one o’clock,”
Allen said.

Chipman said that although there was no
formal curfew, he did expect his players to
be in by 11 p.m. When told that one of his
players was still out at l a.m., Chipman was
surprised and asked his identity.

“I’d like to know who that player was. I’d’
appreciate your telling me,” he said.

The Panthers usually stay at an Oakland
hotel the night before an afternoon game,
but since the game was scheduled to begin at
2 p.m.,,Chipman dropped the hotel restric-
tion as well as the curfew.

“They were allowed to stay in the dormi-
tories," Chipman said. “I told the players
that we expected them to be mature enough
and responsible enough that they would go
to bed and get enough rest so they could play
today.” ’

Allen later altered his story, claiming that
he went to a movie with his girlfriend and
returned to his dormitory by ll:l5 p.m. He
said that he was not wearing the Pitt varsity
jacket and blue sweats in which he was seen
but was dressed all in white.

“I saw George Allen looking in the win-
dow of The University Shop, holding a bag
from the ‘O’ [Original Hot Dog Shop]. I
guess he went out for a late night snack, I
don’t know,” said the leader of a student
group, who asked that his name be withheld.

“He was wearing a blue Pitt varsityjacket;
I’m not really sure what color his sweats
were. I know it was George Allen though.
I've been to a lot of games.”

between 12:30 p.m. and l a.m.

“I said to him, ‘What are you doing out?
Shouldn‘t you be resting up for the big game
tomorrow?’ He just laughed.”

Allen and teammate Billy Culbertson
were reprimanded for showing up late for a
team meeting before the Connecticut game
on Jan. 7. Neither player startedpm that
game as a result.

These matters are dealt with on an indi-
vidual basis, according to Kimball Smith,
sports information director for basketball.

“The question here is did he break curfewfl.

-- since there was no curfew - or did he
show a bad error ofjudgment," Smith said.

“As far as punishment goes, some players
who were late for meetings didn‘t play in the
games, but Coach Chipman handles these
things by the individual case."
