Holland  
declares
need for
severe
weather
policies

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

If Pitt Faculty Assembly
President James Holland has his
way, we’ll never have to relive
the “Snowstorm of “'94” again.

In light of last week’s heavy
snowfall, Holland expressed a
need for a severe-weather plan-
ning policy at yesterday’s
Faculty Assembly meeting.

The policy would notify Pitt
faculty, staff and students of the
university’s definite status dur-
ing bad weather such as last
week’s storm. Holland said that
did not happen when the storm
hit.“Every college and university
in the city of Pittsburgh, I ‘
believe, was closed [Jan. 4]
except for the University of
Pittsburgh,” Holland said.

“But it was a little ambiguous
to people whether it was closed
when they looked out and
heard of the other closings.”

Holland said the facts that

In the battle of fraternities at Pitt, Lambda
Chi Alpha has reached into an old bag of
tricks to try to draw prospective rushees to
its fraternity.

heels is pictured beneath the slogan,
“Accept Nothing Less.”

all women objects of sexual intimidation

and harassment,” said Pitt student Stacy
Farr. ‘

Inter—Fraternity Council President Brian
Rifkin was made aware of the posters, and
he ordered the fraternity to take down all
the remaining posters by 5 pm. yesterday
or suffer fines. '

According to Lambda Chi Alpha President
Craig Giron, the fraternity took down the

and we never had any complaints before
from the IFC or any women’s groups,”
Giron said.

He also said the poster helped make stu-
dents aware of the fraternity and the rush
events in past years.

Shira Hassan, president of Campus
Women’s Organization, said she was
outraged over the posters. She said, “We
received 10 or 15 phone calls complaining
about the posters.”

Hassan said she feels the IFC did not go
far enough with its action against Lambda

questions of whether they
should be charged vacation
days for missing work, and
whether Pitt should have
opened for business in the first
place.

“I think it was not a responsi-
ble matter to be open on
Tuesday [Jan. 4l,” Holland
said. “But I don’t know how
or where a decision was made
or whether a decision was
made.”

Lengthy search ends, Daley named new Greek coordinator

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

Kerry Daley may be new to the posi-
tion of Greek -coordinator but she is a
familiar face to many on Pitt’s campus.

Daley assumed her new duties on Jan.
3, after serving as graduate assistant for
Greek affairs (GSGA) for the past two
years under previous Greek Coordinator
Bridget Guernsey and Terry Milani.
Milani served as interim coordinator dur-
ing the search for Guernsey’s replace-
ment.

“I had a very positive relationship with
Bridget,” Daley said. “Terry and Joe

Cavalla [director of student activitiesl
allowed me to work as a professional.
They enabled me to prove myself.”

As Greek coordinator, Daley will
supervise the activities of Pitt’s 37 nation-
al fraternities and sororities which have a
membership of over 2,000 students.

Panhellenic Association President
Kelly Ready said she was “very excited”
about Daley’s appointment.

“[Daleyl has a great deal of experience
working with the Greek system and with
the new Panhel and IFC officers,” Ready
said. “She’s already been molded for the
role.”

During her tenure as GSGA, Daley

helped revise Greek 101, an education
session for new Greeks, and updated the
president’s conference‘.

The new Greek 101, which previously
took up one night a week for a semester,
was streamlined to a (fine-day session.
The president’s conference, a retreat for
Pitt fraternity and sorority presidents,
was also Daley’s project.

“We turned it into to something run by
the students for the students,” Daley

_ said.

The event originally was set up by
someone outside the university but it is
now organized by students who also
serve as speakers at the conference.

Now that she is coordinator, Daley
said she would like to work with other

offices of the university such as the

Office of Residence Life and the Office ol
Health Education. I

“On certain projects, we might be able
to combine budgets and save money,”
Daley said.

“We can use our team with their
teams.”

According to Daley, Pitt’s Greek sys-
tem’s organization and its students’
involvement in other activities make it
one of the strongest in the country.

jobfairs 0179?" students 6-1-‘jump start on landing at career

In today’s job market, it’s
important to take full advantage
of every opportunity to contact
employers. And one of the best
ways to meet recruiters is
through job fairs. Job fairs are
convention-style events where
company representatives are
available to discuss employ-
ment opportunities at their
organizations. Many companies
prefer job fairs to other types of
recruiting, since it allows them
to meet with a large number of
candidates at a relatively low
cost. In most cases, recruiters do
not conduct formal interviews at
job fairs —— you may only be
given a few minutes of their
time. It’s very important, then,
to go into job fairs with a strate-
gy for success.

First, try and find out before-
hand what companies will be
represented at the job fair.
Generally, the organization
sponsoring the event will have
at least a tentative list of atten-
dees available. While you’re at
it, take the time to double check
any restrictions on attending the

fair —— college, academic status,
registration fees and deadlines,
etc. This could save you from
needless misunderstandings
and disappointments later on.
Using the list of attendees,
you can then target company
recruiters with whom you’d
most like to meet. Keep in mind
that you may not have the time
to talk with every company rep-
resentative at the job fair. You’ll
need to prioritize your contacts.
For example, you might classify
each company according to its
importance to your job-search
goals and objectives (i.e. type of
industry, company size, geo-
graphic location, etc.). Certain
companies would be ranked a
“must—see” while others would
be worth meeting only if you
had sufficient time towards the
end of the event. For those
companies in which you’re
most interested, take the time to

do a little research —— what does:

the company produce? What
kind of service does it provide?
And how large is it in relation to
others in its industry? Most

Holland said despite Pitt’s
choice to remain open during
the snowstorm, maintenance
workers had a difficult time
clearing! sidewalks and parking
lots of the 20 inches of snow
which blanketed them.

“It was pretty annoying
by Wednesday morning to
have major paths to major class-
rooms that didn’t even have one
track plowed in them,” Holland
said.

“But nevertheless  I can’t
judge. A lot of people out there
were working very hard,” he

said.

“There needs to be a [severe
weather} policy and we need
to be prepared  not to get
our people on the streets
when they shouldn’t be,” he
added.

university business or related
travel. Laird, who said the poli-
cy came about in an effort to
make the reimbursement
process more efficient, called it
“fair, reasonable and fiscally
conservative.”

Assistant Controller Bob
Barnes said the travel policy
was streamlined without many
major overhauls.

“We saved some stuff, and we
added a lot of stuff and we
made a lot of changes  we
gained consistent standards,” he
said.

THZE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 12, 1994

Among the policy’s major

changes, Barnes noted, were
the provisions to allow reim-
bursements for social functions
which were previously not per-
mitted.
- Laird said social reimburse-
ments must receive written
approval from Pitt Chancellor
J. Dennis O’ Connor and either
the senior vice chancellor or
the dean of their respective
school.

policy include:

She also noted that this helps
combat the negative way in
which many people perceive
Greeks.

“Yes, we are social organiza-
tions, but we are working to
develop leaders,” Daley said.

Daley may look familiar to
Pitt students other than Greeks
because she completed her
undergraduate degree at Pitt in
1990 and her Master’s Degree in
Higher Education in 1993.

Daley is a sister of Chi Omega
sorority and served as its
president during her junior year.

After graduating from Pitt,
Daley worked in pharmaceuti-
cal sales for two years before
returning as the GSGA at Pitt.

“Inter-Fraternity Council has

President Brian Rifkin said.
“[Daley] has been a big part of

Walking around campus the past few days, many stu-
dents saw a poster advertising the spring term rush of
the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. The poster featured a
picture of a woman dressed in only a tank—top and
high—heel shoes. Across the top, the slogan for the fra-
ternity read “Accept Nothing Less.”

The poster sparked outrage among some students on
campus, and the president of the Campus Women’s
Organization said that they had received, “1O or 15
calls complaining about the posters.”

According to Kerry Daley, the new Greek coordina-
tor, a policy exists that “during rush there cannot be

posters picturing women.” She went on to note that

Lambda Chi Alpha was aware of the policy before they
put up the ‘poster.

Fraternity President Craig Giron said the posters
were printed‘ before this semester began and that the
fraternity had no knowledge of the policy.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse. They violated a
policy that is discussed in the Inter—Fraternity Council
every year. Because of their actions, the spring term
rush for Sigma Chi Lambda should be suspended.

The action taken was not enough. The fraternity was
merely ordered to remove the posters by a given
deadline or else face fines. ‘

Yet, any fine would have been a drop in the keg
compared to the money that was brought in by new
members.

Suspending rush activities would be a punishment
fitting the crime. The poster was designed to bring in
new members and by removing the fraternity’s ability
to do that would be fitting.

The Inter—Fraternity Council has recently said that
they want to remove negative stereotypes about the
Greek organizations on campus. This is a chance to
make a strong statement of that goal and to set an
example for other fraternities.

With the slap on the wrist that this incident precipi-
tated, other fraternities are less likely to adhere to the
rules and guidelines for fraternity rushes. _

Ultimatums are not good enough; firm, appropriate
action must be taken to show that violations of the
rules are serious affairs regardless of the infraction.
This was a blatant violation of a policy that the frater-
nity should have known existed.

In order to avoid future incidents of this type, the
fraternities should make themselves aware of the poli-
cies of the Inter-Fraternity Council. Also, there should
be a process of review for advertisements that may be
considered offensive.

Again, the Inter-Fraternity Council should take this
opportunity to act and show that they are serious
about reshaping their image. The fraternities should
also see that behavior of this type can not and will not
be tolerated.

Health care, ploy for more power

The major discussion of the
Clinton health care plan seems
to be centered around ques-
tions of how the plan will be
paid for, how many options
will be available and when
total coverage will ‘be
achieved? While these are all
logical questions, the primary
question should be IF it should
be implemented at all. The
answer to that question is no!

The idea of universal health
care appeals to many, liberals
mostly, who feel it’s the
responsibility of government to
take care of the people. This
belief, that government is there
to feed, clothe, shelter and heal
the people, is misguided. That
is clearly not the intended
function of our government as
designed by the founding
fathers. Coming from a monar-
chy, they wanted a simple gov-
ernment which was strong
enough to maintain unity but
weak enough to remain out of
the people's everyday lives.

The idea that health care is a
right is ludicrous. A right is
something one is born entitled
to and which can be exercised
freely without physical reper-
cussions to others.

Health care is not a right, it is
an attempt to further socialize
America. As we have all seen,
through the Soviet Union and
socialist Europe, socialism
works better on paper than it
does in reality. While in an
ideal world it would be nice if
every got the best medical care
provided for them, in the real
world it doesn’t work that way.

Quite frankly, I don’t trust
government with my health
care. After all, these are the
same people who ran the post
office so badly into the ground
that it had to be privatized in

order to rebound. These peo-~

ple, who run the IRS, want to
cut back the paperwork and
bureaucracy of the health
industry. These are the same
people who can’t control their
own spending (resulting in the

national debt), and overspent
every Reagan budget, that want
to control the cost of health
care. When was the last time
government made ANYTHING
more efficient, or for that mat-
ter, cheaper?

Universal health care takes
away the people's rights to
choose their own health care.
To be frank, right now I can
have any level of health care
that I can afford, and under the

 

 

Clinton plan, that just simply
wouldn’t be true. I would have
to choose from whatever three
“alliances” my state opted for.
This will inevitably create a sit-
uation where quality of care is
much lower, a system that is
overcrowded and a system
where a seven-member board,
and not the health-care clients,
will determine which proce-
dures are pmdent.

This society was founded on
individuality and the free mar-
ket, and this plan chips/\away
at both. We have the best
health-care system in the
world. Look at nations which
employ socialized medicine.
Sweden, Bill Clinton’s model,
has nearly been bankrupted by
health care, and has now made
the move toward privatization.
Better yet, if you want to see
government-run health care,
look V at Veterans’
Administration hospitals.
Everyone has heard the tales of
excessive red tape and claim
denials made by V.A. hospitals.
The entire nation of Canada
erhas fewer MRI machines than
the city of Pittsburgh - another
example of socialism at work.

This is not to say that health

"care prices aren’t extremely

high, but that is due, in part, to
the overbearing regulations on

the health care industry, the.

tremendous_ research and the
number of experimental surg-
eries. Reform the legal system
that is constantly driving the
cost of insurance up with false
malpractice suits. Offer tax
incentives to those who refrain
from “unnecessary proce-
dures,” but universal, govern-
meat-sponsored eeverage will
not work. And Bill Clinton
knows it.

Why then is he so deter-
mined to accomplish it?, Well,
the answer to that question can
be found in a column by
Richard L. Berke, which
appeared in the October 29,
1992 edition of The New Yorle
Times. The article discusses a
false Clinton ad. More impor-
tant was the reasoning behind
it. According to Berke, “This ad
features a familiar scare tactic
of the Democrats: playing up
to senior citizens’ fears that
their Social Security will be cut.
It has long been a sure-fire
issue for the Democrats,
though it is doubtful that
Congress would ever approve
a cut in entitlements.”

Under universal health care,
the Democrats would be able
to use that scare tactic on every
American. By placing health
care under the same umbrella
as Social Security and welfare,

- you essentially turn the popu-
lation into registered
Democrats — not because they
now agree with the ideals of
Democratics, but becausethey
now associate Republicans
with the loss of their coverage.

This is an attempt to put
more power in the hands of
bureaucrats and secure the
Democrats’ hold on
Washington. It is time for us to
open our eyes to what this
issue is really about, and then
fight it on that level.

B00/eer T. Stallwortla is a con-
seruatz'L*e beacon of light in a
dismal liberal world.

 

Wrestlers dump Franklin & Marsall, -9

By Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers started oﬂf their home
wrestling season with a bang as the 24th-
ranked Panthers overmatched Franklin &
Marshall last night at Fitzgerald Field
House.

A score of 52-9 gives the impression
that the Panthers easily defeated the
Diplomats of Franklin & Marshall but
assistant coach Jim Beichner said that was
not the case.

“The scores show that the match could
have been much closer,” said Beichner.

Pitt sophomore John Richey provided
the highlight of the evening. Richey, who
is still wrestling with a face mask due to a
nasal injury, used quick feet and hands
and a highly aggressive style to dominate
his opponent. Leading 12-2 after two
periods, Richey kept up the pressure and
eventually won via a technical fall.

“Richey [is] always pretty aggressive,”
head coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “He’s
a tough wrestler and a tough kid.”

Senior Rich Catalano improved his
strong record this season to 12-1 with an
impressive victory over Sam Sassani of F
& M. Catalano started and ﬁnished quick-
ly by dominating Sassani early and pin-
ning him with 1:19 left in the first period.

The lowlight of the evening came in the
126 lb division when referee Kent Bailo
stunned the coaches and the good
Tuesday evening crowd by blowing the
take-down call against Pitt rookie Eric
Knopsnyder. Knopsnyder was behind in
points, but was controlling the action

Pitt sophomore John Richey dominated his match last night.

ders were to the mat and called a fall
against Pitt.

“He blew the call at 126,” Stottlemyer
said. A

A couple of Panthers, Sean Hoover and
Shawn Kennedy, were wrestling in differ-
ent weight classes to help out the team.
Hoover came up a little short in his match
losing 5-2. But Kennedy, filling in the big
footsteps of Jeff Kliober, physically over-
powered his opponent en route to his 7-3
victory. Kloiber sat out because wrestlers
are limited to competing in 16 meets.

In the 177 class, Derek Burgert wrestled

when Bailo wrongly ruled that his shoul-

a smart and controlled match before
eventually pinning Jon Koteski with 1:29
left in the match. 

Brett Gould would not allow himself to
be frustrated with his opponent’s constant
head—slaps during his 142 match. Gould
kept a level head and systematically dou-
bled up his opponent 8-4. ’

Chris Stevens started the ball rolling for
the Panthers with a solid effort at 118 lbs.

Heavyweight Pat Wiltanger closed out
the nights scoring with a pin in the sec-
ond period to seal the final score, 329, in
favor of the Panthers.

Harsh practice prepares Pitt for conference

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staff Writer

Life in the Big East Conference can
be pretty cruel for the faint of heart,
which makes Sotiris Aggelou’s recent
rough-and—tumble experience known
as Monday practice —— where the
Panthers prepare for tonight’s battle
with the University of Miami, (Fla.) (7
p.m., ESPN) —— all the more harrow-
ing. _

Aggelou, Pitt’s rookie shooting
guard and, according to head coach
Paul Evans, its hardest worker, got a
dose—and-a-half of the aggressive
mentality that epitomizes league play
 from his own teammate, no less.

The instigator? Fellow Big East new-
comer Willie Cauley.

Cauley, manning the right baseline
of a zone during a drill to combat the
defense, repeatedly ran screaming at
Aggelou’s midsection as the latter
hurled three—point attempts over said
zone.

After two near misses at Aggelou’s
tummy, the power forward connected
with a playful jab to the midsection,
temporarily causing the guard to dou-
ble over.

And these guys are teammates?

“We always try to make life more
miserable in practice, because they

‘won’t hit you in a game,” an amused

Aggelou said afterwards. “They play
hard in a real game, but they don’t
touch you like Will does.”

Aggelou also banged up his knee in
a midair collision with fellow outside
marksman Jason Maile, and he fin-
ished practice a bit gimpy.

~winning the back-to-back home

The same can be said for the
Panthers, who enter a critical two-
game homestand tonight tied for third
in the Big East (with Boston College)
at 2-1.

Fresh from a 79-75 loss at Syracuse
following a 12-day respite, Pitt enters
the Miami game reasonably healthy,
both physically and mentally — with
Chris Gant’s broken finger the only
injury of note.

“We’re trying to get Chris back into
the flow,” Pitt forward Orlando
Antigua said, “But we’re playing better
with every game." ' .

When all is said and done in "93-94,
this week may prove to be the water
shed week for the 7-5 Panthers .
Following tonight’s game against last
place Miami (7-4, 0-3 in the Big East),
Pitt hosts the conference’s other cellar
dweller, Seton Hall (7-4,. 0-5 in the Big
East).

After that, it’s four of six on the road
—— with the two home games against
Georgetown at the Arena, and 15th- _
ranked Connecticut (12-1, 3-0, first
place in Big East) at Fitzgerald.

Must wins injanuary? Maybe. .

“lt’s very important,” Antigua said of 
games coming up against the ‘Canes
and Pirates. “We’re 2-1 in the Big East ~
right now, but it seems like everyone
is 2-1 in the conference."

“If we take care of business and win
these two home games, we’ll be 4-1’
and much more "comfortable going 
into the rest of the season.” 5

Pitt faced a similar situation two dif- 1
ferent times last year  with disas-

Last season, the Georgetown
University women’s basketball
team rolled to a 23-7 regular
season record, earned its first-
ever NCAA tournament bid and
knocked Northern Illinois and
Penn St. out of the tourney
before losing to Virginia in the
Eastern Regional Semiﬁnal. ’

One year later, the Hoyas are

stumbling into tonight’s meeting
with the Pitt Lady Panthers (10-2
overall, 4-0 in the Big East) with
a 6-6 record, 0-4 in the Big East.

“The thing about Georgetown
is they are mad because they
are not winning,” Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce said. “Every
game they lose, they are getting
closer to winning one.”

The loss of three key starters
from last year’s regular season
Big East co—champions is one

factor that has been adding to
those loss totals for the Hoyas.
Guard Niki Reid, forward Leni
Wilson and 1995 Big East Player
of the Year Kris Witfill are all
gone from last year’s squad.
Guard Nadira Ricks has taken
much of the offensive load. The

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, langﬂ 12, 1994

Hampered Hoyas next hurdle for improved Lady Hoopsters

conference in scoring with an
average of 75 points per game.
Stopping the opponent from
scoring is what has escaped
Georgetown eso far this season.
The Hoyas are one rung from
the bottom of the conference
ladder in points given up (74.2

ppg).
One reason for the high scor-

ing numbers from both sides of '

Georgetown games is the
Hoyas’ up-tempo style of play.
One of the differences for Pitt
this season has been a move
towards a scheme like
Georgetown’s. The Lady
Panthers are running more than
ever this season.

“We have to know how to use
that [fast] break,” Bruce said.
“When we play Georgetown 
that’s what they want  press,
steal, score. Whztt we have to do
is break the press and try to

score out of it.”

Pitt’s biggest advantage
against Georgetown’s disruptive
defense (second in the Big East
with 11.3 steals per game) is a
solid, experienced lineup. The
Lady Panthers start three seniors
Gill Colabrese, Carolyn Miller
and Jonna Huemrich) along the
front line with juniors Carol
Morton and Jenine Joyce in the
backcourt. -

Pitt has taken care of the ball
this season, with a total of 210
turnovers — the third lowest in
the conference. The Lady
Panthers’ veteran group has
been able to pull together
whenever things have started to
unravel so far this season.

“We need to take advantage
of what is our strong suit when
we are playing [Georgetownl,”
Bruce said. “That is the team

Women runners shine, send eight to ECAC’s, one to NCAZ

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

The men’s and women’s track
and field teams continued to
shine in their first meet of the
New Year venturing down
South to compete in the Father
Diamond Invitational at George
Mason University.

In the women’s events the
Panthers romped, coming home
with eight East Coast Athletic
Conference qualifiers, an NCAA
qualifier, one school record and
two first place ﬁnishes.

For Lady Panthers head track
and ﬁeld coach Steve Lewis, his
team’s weekend performance is
a preview of what will happen
in upcoming weeks.

“For the first time we could
have what I call the Big Three,”
Lewis said.

“We can have a lot of fun.
We can pursue several areas for
national qualifying standards.
And next would have to be
competitive for the Big East and
ECAC Championship.”

‘One person who could play a
very important role in the Lady
Panthers’ goals this year is
Najuma Fletcher.

This past weekend, Fletcher
took second in the long jump
with a leap of 20-feet-1 5/4
inches, breaking the school
record and qualifying for the
NCAA’s in that event.

“I improved a little bit,”
Fletcher said. “It improved my
chances of getting into the
NCAA’s"

The former Olympian took
first place in the high jump with
an ECAC qualifying jump of
1.73 meters, then was timed at

concept.”

Another similarity in style is
that both teams have been
shooting from three—point
range.

Pitt and Georgetown are sec-
ond and third in the league in
treys made behind traditional
long-range gunning Providence.

The difference is Pitt shoots
the three a lot more efficiently.
The Lady Panthers lead the Big
East with a .405 shooting per-
centage from three-point range.
Georgetown is hitting only 31
percent from beyond the arc.

Bruce said he is not con-
cerned about playing at
Georgetown.

“\We’ve won three [Big East]
games on the road, so going to
Georgetown 
to be shaky,” Bruce said. “You
know how everybody says that
you split on the road and win at
home and you will have a good
year. '\X7e’re winning on the
road, too. Who made that up 
that you can’t win on the road?”

0 Following back—to-back
Big East road victories at
Boston College and Miami,
the #15-2 Panthers returned
home for two home games at
the Civic Arena in late
January/early February
against Syracuse and
Villanova. They lost both
games.

0 Five games later —— fol-
lowing a monstrous 95-79
upset win at Illinois — Pitt
tanked a second time, falling
at Fitzgerald to a scrappy
Boston College squad, 79-56,
and, later that week, to
UConn by a single point, 81-
80.

Despite the relevant simi-
larities between last year and
this year, Antigua insists that
things will be different this
time around, namely
because the team is different.
It’s better.

“This team is definitely bet-
ter [than the 1992-93 squad].
Wc’ve got seven-eiglit guys
to contribute all the time.

\X/'e’re stronger up front, and
deeper all around.”

Especially inside. Pitt leads
the Big East in scoring
offense (81.3 points per con-
test), thanks in large part to
its biggest player —- center
Eric Mobley.

“E” leads the team in scor-
ing (14.7 points per
game), field goal percentage
(59 percent), rebounding
(7.7 rebounds per game),
blocked shots (3.3 blocks per
game) and dunks (trust me!)

Mobley’s inside antics --
which helped him notch 28
points in Saturday's loss at
Syracuse —— have forced Pitt
opponents to play zone
defense —— a strategy oft
employed to expose Pitt's
weak outside game.

“Eric’s played very well for
us lately.” Antigua said.
“'\Y/e’ve done a good job
moving the ball around, get-
ting Eric the ball. \We need to
continue to do that, because
we’re going to see more
zones as the season goes
on."
