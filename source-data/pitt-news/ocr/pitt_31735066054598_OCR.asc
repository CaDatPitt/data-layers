UPMC’s new X’-ray scanner may revolutionize cancer detection.

Pitt workers: New p
contract ”bogus”

- Hal Turner
Edltor In Chlef

A Pittmaintenance worker hopes her “ﬂam-
ing sword of justice” can help overturn what she
has called the‘ “fraudulent” ratiﬁcation of the
new union rcontractapproved two weeks ago. '

Ann Schwartz, a cleaning worker in Salk
Hall, said the Aug. 25 balloting was tainted._ She
listed problems such as inaccuracies in the con-
tract distributed to employees ‘and a union offi-
cial who continuously stuffed his hand in the
ballot box. » A I 1

“Damn it, let‘ us have a fair election,”
Schwartz said. “When we voted, we were ‘vot-
ing on a bogus contract.” I '

But Billy Joe Jordan, «president of Service
Employees International Union Local 29 — the
union representing Pitt’s 363 maintenance
workers — said nobody broke any bylaws ‘and
union voting has been like this for 35 years. A

“I’ve been doing this all my life,” Jordan
said. “There were no violations. I feel this is
kind of petty.” It’s common practice to open the

‘ ballot box and push ballots down to make more

room, he said. When Sergeant. at Arms John
Listisen smashed the ballots into _the box, he
wasn’t tainting the vote, Jordan added.
Schwartz said she collected the signatures
of 160 union employees who disagree. She sent
a letter to SEIU International President Andrew

The University of Pittsburgh"

Medical Center is using a first—of-its-
kind scanner researchers say may revo-
lutionize X-ray imaging to evaluate
patients with known cancer masses_.

The scanner combines two types of ‘

X-rays in one picture. In the past the X-
rays had to be scanned separately and
then superimposed together. '

Pitt researchers say the new scanner
will greatly increase the likelihood of
discovering diseases by integrating the
two processes to show the presence of
illness. n

Until now, using X-rays to show
exactly where diseases exist was diffi-

cult because of the problem of superim-
posing the separate Computer—assisted
X-ray Tomography (CT) and Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) images.
CT is a system of multiple X-ray
data assembled by a computer. It pro-
vides more accurate images of internal
anatomy than single—image X-rays. PET
provides the detailed information on
biochemical processes. .
In the past, superimposing the two

images proved difficult. Because organs

could have shifted during the time
between the two scans, the images were
sometimes incompatible.

Pitt has established an Intemet-
only computer—product store that will
provide greater discounts to students on
computers and accessories. V

Pitt’s E—Store, which replaces the
PC Center, will be accessible 24 hours
a day at http://e-store.pitt.edu.
Consumers will have a choice of equip-
ment from over 1,100 leading manufac-
turers, including Microsoft, IBM and
Apple. V

In addition to computers, acces-
sories such as printers, computer tables,
toner cartridges, ’
DVD movies, and
CD-ROM programs
and games will be
available.

- The new site was

Center (formerly
located on the second
ﬂoor of Bellefield
Hall) was no longer
able to give the best
possible discount to
the University com-
munity and "also

costs, according to
Jinx Walton, director
of Computing and
Information Services. 
Walton cited the highly "competitive
pricing in the computer industry as the
reason for the PC Center’s closing.

“The PC center was established at a
time when educational discounts were
greater but not accessible,” said
Walton. “There was a discount but no
way for a student to use it.”

The discounts are available to all
University students, faculty and
employees, but the exact amount will

vary from each vendor. All products
will be shipped directly to any address
provided, eliminating the need to pick
up merchandise directly at the PC
Center.

“This way offers more timely
delivery and better pricing,” said
Walton. ,

Purchases will be made with digital
certiﬁcates provided by a company
called VeriSign, a leader in Internet
purchase security. The certiﬁcates will
work as a key to the Web site and can
be transferred to other Web sites for
purchases.

“These certiﬁcates provide a secure
method of authenti-
cating,” said
Walton. “It veriﬁes
the identity of an
individual as a
member of the
University commu-
nity. We primarily
set this up for stu-
dents.”

Syracuse University

Weekend storm rips through campus, leaving 480 students without dorm rooms

Amy Kozy

 

The Student Volce

SYRACUSE, N.Y. (U-Wire)-

Syracuse University is a disaster area.
Literally.

Gov. George Pataki declared nine
counties, including Onandaga County,
to be in a state of “Disaster
Emergency” as a result of last week-
end’s unexpected storm.

“Disaster” may be the best word
for it. Trees, power lines, and phone
lines are down all over Syracuse and
SU. University student residences
were damaged, and most of the city
lost its power.

According to WIXT meteorologist
Dave Eichom, the storm, which origi-
nated in Canada, produced 90 mph
winds and moved through the area at
between 50 and 60 mph.

Most SU students were completely
unprepared.

Freshman Jen Varon was playing
in the rain with ‘friends just after the
storm started. She said that she and her
friends went to their rooms in Flint
Hall to get rain gear but heard the other
women in her building screaming
about the storm.

“The RA made us sit on the ﬂoor
and put our hands over our heads,”

Varon said.

Niko Niarhos, a sophomore com-
munication design major, had a similar
experience just off campus.

Niarhos said he was in Fagan’s on
South Crouse Avenue when the storm
hit but that most of the other bar
patrons were too drunk to realize the
extent of the damage that was about to
occur.

“They were screaming and having

‘a good time,” Niarhos said. “They

'~

was wttcomtz  

were standing in front of the windows
and not even thinking about it.”

Niarhos said that he tried to drive
back to his South Campus apartment
but was unable to get past debris in the
streets. He eventually parked on
Euclid Avenue and walked home only
to find his apartment drenched and his
belongings in a state of disarray
because he had left a window open.

Marie DeRoberts, South Campus
housing coordinator, said a total of 10
buildings on South Campus were
deemed uninhabitable because of
storm damage. DeRoberts said that
480 residents of Slocum Heights are
now being put up at the Hotel
Syracuse, with the overﬂow going to
the Marriott.

DeRoberts said the Goldstein

unable to go back to their homes.

DeRoberts said there was no con-
ﬁrmation from the Niagara Mohawk
Power Company as to when power
would return to South Campus housing
but that the students she had dealt were
dealing with the power outage calmly.

“Most of them have been in really
good fonn, realizing that there was a
tornado, and it was an act of God, “
DeRoberts said. .

However, the National Weather
Service said the storm wasn’t a toma-
do, but rather a “microburst,” which
can take the form of a severe thunder-
storm.-

_ Evan Frolich, a sophomore, said
he was left homeless by the storm,
which severely damaged his Flint Hall
room.

Frolich said he was sitting outside
with a friend when the storm hit. At
first, he and his friend were just watch-
ing the lightning, but when the chairs
they were sitting in blew out from
under them, they realized it was time
to go inside.

The scene inside Haven wasn’t

Stern Aug. 26, voicing the group’s
concerns and asking him to nullify the
vote.

Stern said the union’s voice would
not go unheard.

“We’re certainly going to investi-
gate allegations where members feel
there were inappropriate procedures
or a lack of info,” he said.

Other complaints with the vote.

that union members expressed in the
letter include the following:

0 Jordan was unwilling to call a
union meeting to discuss and fix
errors in the contract;

-Jordan allowed a woman to vote
even though her name did not appear
on the list of registered voters;

- A union member identified only
as Sue, who was obtaining signatures
for leverage in future contract negoti-
ations, may have inadvertently
deterred members from the Aug. 25
vote, and Jordan did not intervene to
stop it; . ‘

- A stack of ballots lay on a table
in the middle of the room unattended,
and anyone could have used them to
cast multiple votes;

-The union held the vote from 2‘
p.m. to 4 p.m., making it extremely

inconvenient for workers on the 11,

p.m. - 7 a.m. shift;

'0 Some service employees were
allowed to leave work two hours early
to vote, while others only received a
short break.

Jordan said everyone in the union

-box by noting that

FROM PAGE 10

should have contained, so calling a
meeting to fix what he called a typo
would have been unnecessary.

The typo involved the date the
workers’ ‘retroac-
tive 3-percent pay
increase would
begin. The correct
date was July 1,
1997; the contract
read Jan. 1, 1997.

The union had
been negotiating for
a new contract
since the end of
1995. '

“I fought hard
to get that for
them,” Jordan said.
“Now I get penal-
ized.”

Jordan rational-
ized Listisen’s hand
entering the ballot

everyone in the
room watched him, removing the pos-
sibility of fraud.

He said that anyone who thought
voting was unnecessary after signing
Sue’s petition should have known bet-
ter.

“They’ve got to have more sense
than that — they’re grown people,”
Jordan said.

' No one could have swiped extra
ballots and Voted more than once,
Jordan said, because a room full of
union officers kept an eye on the pile.

Addressing the night shift’s diffi-
culties in making it to the 2 p.m. vote,
Jordan said, “When it comes to some-
thing as important as voting, which
comes around only every two or three
years, I’d come in to vote.”

He couldn’t
have been able to
open the ballot at 7
a.m., when the night
shift ends, because
finding someone to
watch the box until
4 p.m. would have
been impossible.

“Look at us,”
he said. “They don’t
even trust the com-
mittee members.”

Jordan issued a let-
ter togall 363 local
union members,
explaining his view
of the situation and
hoping to end their
protests.

“This or any
other union is only as strong. as its
members are,” the letter read.

Schwartz stressed that the work-
ers’ dissatisfaction wasn’t with Pitt,
but rather with the union manage-
ment. She said she’s proud of every-
one who signed the letter.

“Do you know what the ‘ﬂaming
sword of justice’ is?” she asked. “This
is it,” she said, shaking her letterto
Stern.“ If justice is going to be done
anywhere, it should start at the bottom
of the barrel, here in the union.”

Tuesday,“

UPMC

designed to determine the effec-
tiveness of the new scanner,
according to Adam Slivka, M.D.,
Ph.D., of the Pitt Cancer Institute
and co—director of UPMC’s Center
for Pancreatic Diseases.

“One of the major difficulties
in helping patients with pancreatic
cancers is that by the time they
[show] symptoms of the disease, it
has already progressed to the point
where it is very difficult to treat
and cure,” Slivka said.

David W. Townsend, Ph.D., a
senior PET physicist and associate
professor in UPMC’s department
of radiology, said, “The trial of the
first PET/CT scanner at UPMC is
designed to validate this new tech-
nique through engineering, scien-
tific and software refinements.”
Slivka said that although studies
remain to be done to determine the
diagnostic accuracy of the new
scanner, early experience with the
technology suggests it will assist
in diagnosing and staging pancre-
atic cancer and may become a
valuable screening tool. The earli-
er detection of pancreatic cancer
will increase patients’ chances of
successful treatment.

The new technology provides

FROM PAGE 1

.more information about the state

of disease processes and also
reduces the need ‘for diagnostic
surgeries, said Richard L. Baron,
M.D., professor of radiology at
Pitt’s School of Medicine and
chairman of the department of
radiology at UPMC.

Townsend is the chief investi-
gator for the development of com-
bined PET/CT technology. In
1995, after working with col-
leagues in Europe to develop a
lower-cost PET scanner,
Townsend, in collaboration with
CTI PET Systems, Inc.‘ of
Knoxville, Tenn}, proposed devel-
opment of the combined PET/CT
scanner. The scanner’s evolution
was facilitated through an
$843,000 grant from the National
Cancer Institute.

Important developments in
image reconstruction by Townsend
and Paul E. Kinahan, Ph.D., a PET
physicist and assistant professor in
UPMC’s department of radiology,
have greatly improved the quality
of images from the dual scanner by
taking into account patient varia-
tion when processing data.

Townsend said software refine-
ments that may result from this

project will increase the quality of _

images PET and CT can produce
even when used separately.

The PET/CT scanner will not
be available elsewhere forat least
a year, Townsend said.

Gender preclefermiinafion
Cl really bad idea  

Yesterday, the Genetics &
IVF Institute in Fairfax, Va.,,
announced that it has ‘reported
success in its method of choos-
ing a baby’s sex before concep-
tion.

While genetic predeterrnina-
tion is nothing new, an article in
the Journal of Human
Reproduction says the process
(sorting sperm by the amount of
DNA they contain) has been
perfected.

Genetic predetermination
sets a dangerous precedent.
From being able to choose
attributes ‘ such as gender,
humanity could go on to a future
like the one portrayed in the
movie “Gattaca,” where human-
ity is forsaken in the pursuit of
human perfection.

If parents are able to choose"
their child’s gender, it won’t be
long before they are able to
choose their child’s sexuality.
While it’s predictable that het-
erosexual parents will more
than likely designate their child
to be heterosexual, the choices

of gay parents are uncertain. _

Would they‘ opt to have their
child be gay, too, and face a life
of discrimination. (though sci-
ence progresses, ignorant atti-
tudes don’t)? Would it be ethical
for parents to designate sexuali-

ty? Isn’t that something*we’re
supposed to discover for our-
selves?

What about the size and
appearance of a child? Parents
selecting their boys to look like
Michaelangelo’s David and
girls to look like Venus would
only create an elite stratum in
society similar to Hitler’s grand
design -for an Aryan nation.
Who, after all, would choose an
“ugly” child? Why have a nerd
as a son when you can have a
jock? Why have a “homely”
daughter when you can have a
supermodel?

Does this generation really
have the right to determine what
members of the next generation
will look like? Do we have the
right to predetermine size,
height, eye color, gender, sexu-
ality, I.Q., health, etc.?

These are attributes that we

should not be choosing; that

choice should be left to Mother

Nature or the right combination

of X and Y chromosomes at the
right time and the right place.

Children should not be
ordered like fast food. Cloning
is one thing, but gene manipula-
tion - is another. This research,
while well-intentioned, is likely
to do more harm to the human
race than good.

Why people get screwed by the law

If you watch the news, you might believe
America’s streets are war zones straight out of
“Full Metal Jacket.”

People lying dead in the streets, the victims
of horrifying shootings committed by 
better equipped than most armies. The innocent
family stalked by the sadistic killer freed from
jail by some ridiculously obscure legal technical-
ity in America’s lenient criminal system has
become the staple plot in movies and TV'shows‘,
although anyone who actually believes that this
ever happens in real life needs to have his or her
head checked pronto.

The government is full of politicians l'l1Il—
ning around, seeking higher oﬂices by trying to
be tougher on crime than the next guy. Sen. Phil
Gramm rrrade the elimination of air conditioning
in prisons the centerpiece of his crime policy dur-

ing his rrm for the presidency. Each year, states -

pass referendums on new laws designed to ﬁght
crime by mandating courts to set speciﬁc penal-

. ties for certain offenses. The result is a criminal
“ justice system that not only wastes the taxpayers’

money, but creates legions of crimi-
nals who commit crimes again and

According to a recent article in
the Washington Post, in the last ﬁve
years ,TV news broadcasts have quadrupled the
number of news stories they run about homi-
cides, while in that same time ﬁ'ame, the number
of homicides in the United States actually has
declined sharply. The unoﬂicial credo of the
news industry is: “Ifit bleeds, it leads. Ifit thinks,
it- sinks.” Perception shapes reality, someone
once told me, and the American justice system is
astrueacaseofthisasyouwilleversee.

All of this phony rhetoric about tougher jail
sentences is dangerous and expensive. It costs
$23,500 a year to incarcerate the typical inmate

and another $74,862 to lock up an inmate at a ‘

maximurn—security prison In 1997, the United
States had an inmate population of 1.2 million
andspent somewhere in the neighborhood of
$21 billion on prisons. The only industrialized
country in the world that locks up a larger per-
centage of its population is Russia.

According to the Sentencing Project, poli-
cies like mandatory‘ sentencing have resulted in
just 5 percent criminal offenders actually serving
time in prison. '- Time magazine observed:

‘Mandatory minimum sentences for minor drug '

crimes have sniffed the prisons with nonviolent
offenders. Almost 40 states are under court order
to relieve overcrowding by releasing prisoners

 
 
   

— even habitual offenders.”

After being forced to sentence a woman
mixed up in a minor drug-related crime to a 10
year prison term, a U.S. district judge com-
plained angrily, “T‘hat’s just crazy, but tl1ere’s
nothing I can do about it.” Thanks to mandatory
sentencing requirements, individuals without
prior criminal records are sent to prison for long
terms, while repeat offenders are let out

Public outrage over the “cushy” life crimi-
nals lead in jail encouraged many politicians
eager to win votes to cut back on work 

and other methods of rehabilitation. By not otfer- .

ing inmates an opportunity to rehabilitate them-
selves, we may be provoking these individuals to
commit more crimes in the future. Having wast-
ed years of their lives away in jail, many become
violent; One prison inmate remarked that other
inmates “are so blind with rage thatthey can’t
think about the consequences.  After so many
years, they have nothing to lose.”
According to criminologist Paul Cromwell
_ of the University of Miami, “Prison systerrrs are
‘criminogenic’: They create crimi-
nals.” By adopting a “lock ‘em up

toward crime, we may actually be
encouraging criminal activity
instead of dissuading it “All we do,” one observ-
er said sadly, “is produce someone meaner and
angrier and more disillusioned with himself and
society.” Considering this, it can hardly be sur-
prising that 80 percent of all crimes are commit-
tedbyjust20percentofallcriminals._
It is also worth noting that the correlation
between more prisons and safer streets" simply
7 doesn’t exist Minnesota, which ranked 37th in
the United States in per capita violent crime, has
i the second lowest incarceration rate of any state.
Southem_ states, which practice particularly
aggressive law—and-order strategies, tend to suf-
fer the highest rates of crime. — p
More than anything else, our misguided jus-
tice system is the product of politicians pander-

ing for votes and the news media offering sensa-_

tionalist stories in search of higher and higher rat-
ings. As long as the public continues to mistak-
enly correlate prisons and longer sentences as
effective deterrents to crime, it seems likely that
American prisons will continue to be a place
where justice is never served. '

Michael Berquist is afraid that as America
becomes less and less dangemus, people get
more and more paranoid about crime.

8A freshman’:

Andrea

Woessner
I knew full well when I sent my
tuition deposit last winter that I would be

coming to an urban area and would have

to deal with all that comes with urban
campuses: noise, panhandlers, thugs,
assorted no-goodniks and throngs of peo-
ple on the sidewalks. I was prepared for
all these, but the thought of murderous
motorists never occurred to me.

On my ﬁrst day of classes, I was
nearly squashed four times by gas-pedal-
happy drivers on Bigelow Boulevard.
Each time I yelped “Yipel” and leaped to
safety. Only a kamikaze mind-set and a
spurt of pure adrenaline got me across.
And forget about trying to cross Forbes
Avenue at its intersection with Belleﬁeld
— it’s not possible. Sure, there are cross-

‘ . walks, but the pedestrian signs are per-

petually ﬂashing “Don’t- Walk” for a
good reason. There are always drivers
gunning it to see if they can mow down a
freshman or two before their lunch break
ends. I must have waited 10 minutes,
hopeful that I could cross, and attempted
to cross ﬁve or six times, eachtime see-
ing an evil glint in the eyes of the drivers
of oncoming cars and leaping back to the
sidewalk, self-preservation instinct
screaming, “Aughhh! Abort! Abort! Fall
back!” , V
Despite risking life and limb, the

traffic on the roads is nothing compared
to the trafﬁc jams in the bookstores. Let
me take a sarcastic minute to congratulate
the Pitt bookstores on their excellent ﬁl-
ing-and-storage * system, prompt service,
friendly and helpful staﬁ, excellent plan-
ning in ordering all the textbooks that stu-

dents need and having them ready before ‘

the fall term actually starts, and lucid
instructions given to incoming freshmen,
who have always had textbooks passed
out to them in class.

I think I went to the bookstores eight
different times in search of the books I
needed for my classes. On behalf of
everyone who wandered‘ around the
bookstore for half a day trying to ﬁnd
books and then had to wait in line hours
upon hours to buy said books," let me just
say, “ARRRGI-II-I!” And God help you if
you accidentally bought the wrong book
or if you decide to add/drop a class (we

won’t even go into the bureaucracy

involved in changing your schedule).
Which brings me to the topic of ﬁre
alarms and helicopters (don’t ask how;
just ﬂow with me). When I found out I
would be living in Lothrop Hall, which is
right next to Children’s Hospital, I was
neither thrilled nor distressed. I ﬁgured
there were places to live worse than a
building next to a hospital. Granted, I
would have to deal with the ambulance
noise, but no sweat. What I didn’t count
on was living right next to a launch pad.

Ballroom, William Pitt Union

1:30pm and 7:30pm

Helicopters of all shapes, sizes, and deci-
bel capabilities land on top of the hospi-

tal at all hours of theday‘-and night. If _

you’re not used to deafening noise com-
ing in sporadic spurts, the helicopters can
present a problem with concentrating on
homework, sleeping and talking.

I suppose it’s one of those things a
person could "gradually get used to, like
being whacked in the head repeatedly.
What really presents a problem is the ﬁre
alarm in Lothrop. It doesn’t sound like a
normal ﬁre alarm — it sounds more like
someone is sitting on a duck, and how
many of us associate ducks with danger?

The ﬁre alarm quacks. three times, is

silent for a moment, quacks another three
times, is silent, quacks another three
times, and stops. That’s it. You’re consid-
ered wamed. And if the ﬁre alarm doesn’t

wake you up or if you have headphones
I on, you’re a cinder.

The security guards for the residence
halls, for the most part, take their jobs far
too seriously. I’m willing to wager that
the majority of them were rejected from
the police academy and thus opted for a
job as a security guard. Now they’re bit-
ter and determined to exercise whatever
meager power they have, lording it over
us like it actually means something. “No,
you can’t come in. I’m not going to press
the button because I feel like making
your life harder.”

On one hand, it’s nice to know that

while I’m asleep in my room, no ax-
wielding psychopaths are going to slip by
and murder me. On the other hand, it’s a
royal pain trying to get into your room.
The scarmers don’t always read your ID
the ﬁrst time through, which makes the
security guards suspicious. On a very hot
day last week, I trudged back to Lothrop

after ﬁghting my way through the book- -

store for the fourth or fifth time. I was
obviously a Pitt student, as opposed to an
ax-wielding psychopath. I had a taxed
and weary expression, a backpack dig-
ging ridges into my shoulders, frazzled
hair, a Pitt bookstore bag and my keys in
hand, and my ID just refused to work.
Rather than mercifully buzz me in, the
fascist under glass made me produce
another form of identiﬁcation, even
though I didn’t look that much different
from my picture on the Pitt ID. I had to
disrupt my entire cargo balance, put
everything down, and fumble through my
backpack for my driver’s license so that

-the Nazi warmabe could inspect it and

ensure that I really was who I said I was.

As I have only been at Pitt for about
a week and a half, I’m sure that my
impressions of it are merely superﬁcial

and will change, as everything does, with

time.

Andrea Woessner would like to consider
this her apology ,to the bureaucrats:

I know what all of you are thinking.

You’re thinking, “Why is this chooch
wearing a St. Louis Cardinals cap, and why
does he have a goatee now?'Is he on the Big
Mac bandwagon, too?” i

Well, the answer to that is yes, but I am
not guilty on all counts. The goatee has
nothing to do with Big Red, but I am guilty
as charged on the hat part.

McGwire has. broken the home-run
record, but you would have to live on the
moon, well, even farther than that, probably
outside the'Milky Way to not know that.

But McGwire’s accomplishments do
not stop at being the most proliﬁc single-
season home-run hitter of all time.

_ Mark McGwire is what the Pirates
claim to be, “what baseball is all about.”
A This monster of a man with 18-inch

forearms — for those of you who know or _

have seen me, that is bigger than my neck
—— refused to admit that he had a chance of
beating the record until he had 50 home‘
runs by the beginning of September. By the
way, he had 55 on Sept. 1. v
The talk around baseball is that maybe
McGwire will walk away with the MVP for
the National League.
_ This is a ludicrous assertion. Big Mac

— is the most valuable player for the game of

baseball, not half of baseball or a team.
He has brought back to the game fan

I interest, which was lost during the 1994

strike. p A
Last year the owners thought they had
a foolproof plan with interleague play, but it
was nothing compared to the mania
McGwire'created by hitting home runs.
Yes, small market teams like
Pittsburgh did sell out games for interleague
series last year, but they did not have the
excitement that Big Red brought to town.
Not only did McGwire make money
for baseball, and_ lots of it, he has been a
tremendous role, model for fans. young and

- old. ‘ .
Near the beginning of the season, he

gave money to a fund for abused children.

questions, which eventually led to an

McGwire later quipped that he_ was

up hurting his family. V

THE Plrr Nraws

 

Money is a big step for field hockey

A A] Rodgers

Graphics Edltor

The hockey ball gets passed from the
opponent’s link to its forward. Pitt’s
defense surrounds the person, and in an»
attempt to get free, the forward drives the
ball into an open space. The right wing is
on the rim, gets the ball, and is on a break-
away toward the goal. VVrth the sweeper
right on her tail, the wing smacks the ball
toward the goalie’s shin pads, a normally

, easy deﬂection —— if the goalie has the right

equipment _ -

This year, thanks to allocated money,
Pitt’s ﬁeld hockey team does.

According to one of last year’s cap-
tains, Betsy Stanshine,“ goalies wearing
ordinary sneakers occasionally blocked
and kicked balls at practice, and other play-
ers" played without shinguards.

Many times people wanted to play but
didn’t have their own equipment or didn’t

bring it to school with them. Now, though,_ .

the team has used its money to buy sticks,
mouthguards, new goalie equipment and

shinguards. _

Stanshine added that since the pro-
gram began in 1995, the team has received
a little money, but it was only enough to
buy a couple of balls and mouthguards.

Angela Shappell, one of this year’s
oiﬁcers, said that the new equipment “will

also help [membership], but it’s more -

dependent on if they want to play.”
Another problem that comes with the
lack of ﬁnances is the lack of a coach.‘

, While the players thought about getting a

coach this year, the season started before
they could find one. If all goes well this
season, they may hire a coach next year.
However, the process of placing ads, inter-

viewing, and then paying the coach from ,

the ﬁeld hockey fund is expensive.

“Every year, new rules come out, and
we have a hard time keeping up. There’s
no one person to lead, and a coach may
lead to more tearn—building experiences,”
said Julie Marmello, another officer.

“It’s‘kind of good and bad. But we’re
not quite as competitive as a lot of other
club sportsat Pitt,” says Shappell. “If you

have 18 credits and a job, practice is only
three times a week, and [there are only]
eight games for the fall. If they want to
play, they can.” .

Until a coach is hired, practices and
games are nm by all three oﬂicers. Starters
are picked according to who has the best
attendance at practice and the best ability.

“We look for the people who show the
most enthusiasm and work hard at prac-
tice,” Marmello said.

Marmello plans to use drills and scrim-
rnages to build a sense of teamwork at
practices that she hopes will carry over to
games. ~ V C

“We hope that our games will show
the talent that we have,” she said.

“I hope we have f1m,” said Shappell.
“I love to play and hope that everyone else
will also have a good time playing.”

. While the date of the club’s ﬁrst game
was still unknown at the time of this publi-
cation, the ﬁeld hockey team holds prac-
tices three times a week on the Cathedral
lawn, Sunday 1:30 p_.m. to 3 p.m., and
Monday and Thu'rsday’5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.

a college’s new soccer team._ What an
honor  but what pressure.

That is the situation.Megan Beasley

. lives with as the ﬁrst worr'1en’s' soccer play-

er ever recruited to Pitt, .
Expectations were low the ﬁrst two

. years, as people understood the growing

pains of new program. ‘ -

But now that the team is in its third
season, people are looking for results. And
"no one feels "that pressure more than
Beasley.

“There’s so much expectation from
students, the University, the athletic
department,” explained Beasley.

But in spite of the pressure, Beasley ~.

continues to develop into a dominant play-
er. Thequalitythatenableshertodothatis
the same quality that originally attracted

_ the attention of head coach Roland Sturk:

her tough personality. . ‘ -

“I_ liked her sheer eﬂort and competi-
tiveness. 'I'hat’s the kind of player we
wanted on our team,” explained Stnrk.

Have a conversation about Beasley
with any of her teammates, and you’ll hear
words like “aggressive” and “intense.” -

Have a conversation with Beasley
herself,and you’ll notice that ﬁery spark
right away. _,

“I’m the kind of player that just does-
n't give up,” she said. .

  Beasley relishes leadership rolein third season

Megan Beasley streaks downfield last season and hopes to lead Pitt in 1998.

Beasley's competitive personality
thrust her into a leadership role immediate-
ly. As a true freshman, just months out of
high school, she was elected captain of her
Division I soccer team. .

This year she was elected captain for
the third time, showing just how much she
is respected by her teammates._

That_ kind of recognition’ could go to
the heads of a lot of players, but not
Beasley, whom Stnrk describes as an
unselﬁsh team player.

/

Beasley's natural position is attacking
midﬁelder. But because of her team’s lack
of defensive depth, she has been moved to
sweeper, a change she’ll gladly embrace

for the good of the team.

Sturk and Beasley go way back. Both
hail from Colorado, and the two ﬁrst met
during Sturk’s years as a coach in the
Olympic Development Program

Sturk was the headjcoach at Regis
College, a Division II school in Colorado.

Moak returns for the second week of the 1998 football season

There’s only one week left until the
Pitt-Penn State game, and we couldn’t have
asked for a better week off.,Considering the
lack of interesting games on this weekend’s
schedule, there aren’t many excuses for Pitt

~ fans to divert their attention from getting

ready for next week But for the die—hards
out there, here are this week’s picks.

Bowling Green (+37 1/2) at Penn State
Unfortunately, the Panthers will not
have the pleasure of trying to deny Joe
Patemo his 300th career win next week
Patemo will get No. 300 on Saturday
against the lowly Falcons. In fact, Penn

State will win by so much that it should be '

counted as two wins. Keep the women and
children away; this one could get ugly.
Penn State 51, Bowling Green 7

Rutgers (+23) at Boston
College

The Scarlet Knights
haven’t beaten a Division I-
A opponent since Bill
Clinton’s ﬁrst term. In fact,
last week, Rutgers just
barely beat Richmond, a
Division I-AA team — and not even an
especially good Division I-AA team like
Vrllanova. After Richmond dominated
Rutgers for most of the game last week,
tl1ere’s no reason to expect Boston College
to have any diﬂiculty at all.
Boston College 45, Rutgers 10

Notre Dame at Michigan State (+7)
The Spartans, cunently 0-2, have to

 

win a game sometime.
They began the season
among the top 25 teams,
but their two losses have
dropped them from the
rankings. A win Saturday
would put them back in
the top 25, where they
_ probably belong. Notre
Dame was the beneﬁciary of a relatively
poor game played by Michigan last week
Both of these teams still have something to
prove, but Michigan State has more, and it’s
at home.

Michigan State 24, Notre Dame 20

Texas (+10) at UCLA
Last year’s 66-3 debacle has not been
forgotten by the Longhorns. Texas nmning

back Ricky Williams has already emerged
as a leading Heisman Trophy candidate, and
he’s as anxious as anybody to erase the
memory of last year’s game against the
Bruins. Wouldn’t it be great if he padded his
Heisman stats and got revenge on UCLA all
in one game? UCLA will be ranked ahead
of Texas at the end of the season, but
Williams and the Longhorns will want this
game badly, and when Williams starts run-
ning, it will be difficult for the Bruins to do
much about it.

Texas 31, UCLA 30

Syracuse (+10 1/2) at Michigan

‘ You can’t really call it “choking” when
you lose to the likes of Tennessee and
Michigan, but Syracuse has a long history
of, shall we say, underachieving in the early
part of the season. The Wolverines were
brought back to reality with their ﬁrst loss in
two years against Notre Dame last week
They are too good to lose two weeks in a
row. The Orangemen are a very good team,
but they aren’t that good
 35, Syracuse 28

This Week’s Best Bet: S
Virginia Tech (+3) at Clemson

Clemson being favored in this game is

more of a joke than anything David
Letterman has ever said in his life. The
Tigers don’t have a quarterback with any
experience, they don’t have any other major
assets on offense, and they don’t have the
kind of defense that can win games by itself.
The Hokies are far from ﬂawless, with a
weak defensive backﬁeld and unproven
runningbacks, but they still shouldn’t be

‘ seriously challenged.

Virginia Tech 27, Clemson 6

 FROM PAee 10

When he landed the job at Pitt, he immedi-
ately went after" Beasley, who wanted to
play in Division 1.

“She was pretty open” to coming to a
new program, Sturk said. “It was a good
opporumity for players who were not the
top kids in the country, maybe overlooked
by some people. Here she’d have the
opportimity to start right away.” ,

’ So it was set. Beasley left the beautiful,
crisp air of the Rocky Mountains and came
to the, umh  beautiful, crisp air of
Oakland.

So after three years, how have things

‘worked out? Beasley and the team are

showing dramatic improvement.

After going a combined 6-28-3 the_

ﬁrsttwo seasons, Pittisoiftoa 1-2 startthis
year, with the losses coming against two
nationally ranked teams.

The Lady Panthers have already
scored four goals, impressive compared to
the seven they scored all of last year. And
this teamhas achancetomaketheBig East
playoﬁs. - V

But if that’s going to happen, much of
the pressure will fall on the shoulders, and
at the feet, of Megan Beasley.

THE Pirr Nrzws

Tuuitsrmv, 10 SEPTEMBER 1998

 FROM PAGE 10,

Last night, after the game,
McGwire did one of the classiest
things any athlete has ever done.

As he was on the podium, talk-

ing to the fans of St. Louis, he

thanked his ex-wife and her new hus-
band for bothbeing at the game and
for making sure his son‘ got there on
time. .

Many divorces end in a mess,-
with the childbeingusedas apawnin
the parents’ game, but this does not
appear to be the case with McGwire.

He and his ex-wife communicate
regularly for the good of their son.

Just after he hit the home run,
McGwire walked into the stands and
embraced the ~Maris family, who
were there to witness‘ his record-
breaking evening. He hugged all of
Roger Maris’ children to show
respect before continuing the game.

Never at any time during this
season did Big Mac think he was big-
gerthan the game. He took all of his
home runs in stride. He did not ever

' predict he would break the record,

and he was very shy and reserved the
whole time.
‘McGwire never showed up a

pitcher, and while he was hitting all of
the home runs, he tried to divert the
attention to his teammates.

At times in the Cardinals’ locker
room after a great pitching perfor-
mance, reporters wo11ld ignore the
pitcher and talk to Big Mac, who may
have gone 1-4 with a single.

Each time, the new home-run
king would say that he had nothing to
talk about and he would send the
reporters to the other lockers. _

I was very thankful A to see
McGwire release some of his excite-
ment last night after the home run. He
had been holding it in all season and
ﬁnally got to let everyone know what
a great wave he has been riding. r
_ When asked about his next goal,
McGwire did not say 70 home runs
or Hank Aaron’s career record He
simply said, “Sleep.”

A class act that brought baseball
back to a great age without skyboxes
and personal seat licenses, an era that
saw baseball ﬂourish and gave rise to
true fans.

Patrick Robertson is the sports editor
of The Pitt News and can ’t wait to see
his son break the home-run total he
holds, one in‘ a high school career

Cross country opens season at WVUp

Tom camillo
For _The Pitt News

It’s not an everyday occurrence in sports for a
team to outscore its opponent and still manages to
lose. Unfortunately, that was the case for Pitt’s
men’s and women’s cross—country teams this past
weekend at West Virginia, where the lowest scorer
is the winner. T

The women lost a dual meet to West Virginia,
15-50. The men’s 51 points placed them behind
the Mountaineers’ 16 but ahead of Mount Saint
Ma1y’s 71. T - —

The deciding factor for both teams this week-
end may have been the lack of able bodies. The
men’s team is small to begin with, but one runner
had not yet completed the paperwork necessary to
compete. Therefore, the team had to “draw upon
track members [for] help,” according to head
coach Dave Sobal.

“We were missing two of the better people’ on
the women’s side,- as well, who were not yet
cleared to compete,” Sobal said

. The strength of the competition cannot be
underestimated, though. “We’re dealing with a
program that is committed to excellence in cross-
country,” Sobal said of West Virginia.

In fact, the Lady Mountaineers were ranked
No. 23 nationally in preseason cross-country polls,
and the men ﬁnished fourth in the Big East last

year.

Their success may be due to West Virginia’s
placing a higher priority than Pitt on rimning.

“VVithin track, we have not put a lot of schol-
arship money into the distance program,” Sobal
said '

Despite these realities, Sobal did have some
positive thoughts about his team’s effort.

‘‘I was surprised how fast West Virginia went
out and stayed out, but we ran well, especially on
a diﬂicult course which is run on farm land and
contains lots of hills and bad footing,” he said

Danielle Rhodes was the ﬁrst to cross the line
for the Pitt women, earning her ninth place, and
according to Sobal, she “would have been the
leader of theracetwo years ago with her time at the
mile mar ” ,

Rhodesisonlyafreshman,andsoisteam-
mate Ashleigh Grinaldi, who ﬁnished third for Pitt.
Unfortunately, she will have to have X—rays on her

i foot, where she may have a stress‘fractu_re. She
won’t race in this weekend’s meet atAkron, and it --- __ _

is unclear how long she will be out.

For the men, Mike Orzechowski ﬁnished ﬁfth
in the meet, the only Panther to ﬁnish in the top 10.

“Orzechowski was tough, very tough He ran
well and fairly competitively,” Sobal said

Overall, Sobal feels the teams have a chance
to be good, and tl1ey’1l get to test ‘themselves this
weekend in a meet at Akron
