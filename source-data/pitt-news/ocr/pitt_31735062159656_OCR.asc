Three Factions Battle for -Votes . . .

B)’ BOB THOMAS ,

Two independent political machines backing slates
that feature no strong independent candidates may or
may not threaten IF Council's continued domination of
student government when men voters go to the polls
tomorrow. ,

Eight Student Congress and 15 Men’s Council seats
will be filled in tomorrow's elections.

Yesterday, in a move unprecedented in recent years,
the Council released its 22-men slate for pre-election
publicity. In former years IFC has followed a closed-

~ mouth policy, not revealing its candidates before

the morning of the election.

Surprise Slates Entered

Close on the heels of the IF surprise, two last-
minute independent political groups sprang slates.

One, the “All-Campus Party,” is backed by a four-
power coalition of Engineering and Mines Association,
Johnstown Center Association, Ellsworth Center, and
Pitt Independent Association.

Its ranks composed of both independents and frat
men the "All-Campus Party" hopes to wrest student
government control from IF Council and put it in the
hands of men who"will take an interest in the great
number of Pitt independents.”

Candidates Overlap

The other independent group is backing a ticket
limited to the 10 independents running for student of-
fice, three men for Congress, and seven for Men’s
Council. The party is bucking IF Council, hoping to
break IF's solid front in the election. ’

Together, “All-Campus,” IF, and the third party_

Open to all students, whether they

are tapees or not, and to all mem-
bers of the faculty, Scholars Day is‘
a yearly program held to recognize
all students who have attained merit
in scholarship.
_ This year's hour-long assembly is
‘similar to programs held in years
previous to 1949, when the Scholars
Day program consisted of separate
hour-long conferences.

Students Welcome

“We want to emphasize that our
program is not only for those receiv-
ing awards, but also for all students
at the University,” said Miss Moses.
"Everyone is urged to join in to
make this the best Scholars Day
held at Pitt.”

Among the special awards to be
given at the assembly are the Howard
Carson Kidd Scholarship, awarded
to the student who hasmade the most
progress in the School of Business
Administration, and the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon award given- to the student
who has shown greatest proficiency
in English during four semesters.

Weiss to Speak
Judge Weiss will speak before the

er of the Pennsylvania State General
Assembly and the U.S.House of Rep-
resentatives, Judge Weiss is also a
prominent football referee, and a mem-

I , Several concrete reasons exist that point to the probable im-
Q 4 potency of opposition to the fraternity candidates this year. Last
41 f'spiring’s independent efforts account for most of the flaws ‘in the
 iwopposition party’s armour. , , ’ -
 Last year the independents had organized leadership. ‘Stuart
7.;Wo—rkmaster got to work early preparing a campaign and slate to
oppose the fraternities. He whipped together a strong ‘coalition
H ’ that “succeeded in placing two ‘of its men in Student Congress.
s‘ This year no such strong, active leader is directing the indepen

“Last year a sizeable number of independent candidates be-
”H_,came eligible for election through either nomination or petition.
, As a result the independents had-nearly a full slate of their own
I ~ ‘non-fraternity candidates. This year only three independents are
I in the running for the eight vacant student Congress posts. Only
_ nine others are on the ballot for the 16 Men’s Council seats. This
_ situation could have been avoided had the independe_nts launched
' 4 their oppositionearly enough to see to it that an adequate number
of persons of their liking wereon the ballot. if r
 = Last year Lou Cecconi headed the independent slate. His vote-
 getting appeal was so great that the independent Coalitionists not
only succeeded in breaking IF’s ticket with Cecconi and Bob
McKowen but found their football-player candidate polling the
. highest number of votes among all the candidates. ,
 Yet this spring’s independents failed to find themselves a
ballot magnet like Cecconi to head their ticket, Instead they have
comparable “unknowns” as their standard-bearers.
, These re_asons and the poor record of lastyear’s independents
, in this year’s Congress indicate well why ‘IF Council can feel
 virtually cock-sure of a complete victory this year.

‘ The Real Students

One day a year, aside’ from commencement, we turn out at-
 tentions from the actions of activities and the prominent figures
‘in activities to pay tribute to those students who have picked
W V pp the most of the primary commodity Pitt offers -- knowledge.

’ That.’s the purpose of Friday morning’s Scholars Day assembly,
when 30 honorary organizations will tap students who are schol-
"ﬂastically outstanding. These tappees won’t.be persons whose
i" Wnames you've likely seen in the News or heard in a conversation,

unless you overhead instructors discussing their star students.

, Despite adequate notice and extensive program planning,
gattendance at the Scholars Day programs the last few springs
I has been Vdiscouragingly poor. Last year, hoping to give the pro-
* _'gram’s turn’out-appeal ashot in the arm, the committee changed the
format of the program into a series of forums, scattered through-
,7 otit Scholars Day. This failed. So the committee has returned to
the one-hour assembly plan, to be held this year at Stephen Fos-
f_ ter". Memorial. '

D The danger always exists that continued apathy towards the
 program on the part of the student body could mean the cancella-
_ iltioniof Scholars Day. This would be unfair to those students who
rarepreslent the top level of scholarship of the University. A house-
\-full of spectators Friday would indicate the student body’s vote
of approval forthe accomplishments of these scholars and the

Pitt News

Rumor rightly has it that “poli-
tics” play a large part in men’s
politics at Pitt. But the men must
take off their hats to women poli-
ticians whose well oiled political
machine has for years escaped the
notice of even such inquiring re-
porters as Bill Scrivo.

I say the female politicians are
much smarter than the men because
they have managed to work subtly.

As Dick Kovar aptly put it once
in Student Congress, the women

aristocracy.’

Take for example the so-called
‘election’ of the presidents and
V.P.’s of women’s organizations.
Are the girls given a choice of
candidates? Definitely not. Two
candidates are nominated by a''
committee. The one with the high-

the other automatically becomes
V. P. Thus, the nominating com-
mittee is sure of putting two girls
on the next executive committee,’
and subsequently on the next
year’s nominating committee. “'

Of course, the other officers -
recording secretary, corresponding
secretary, and treasurer - are cho-
sen democratically. Two girls are
put up for each office. But if the
nominating committee is really
worried about the chances of one
of its proteges, all it has to do is
nominate some unknown to run
against her and thus insure the
‘election’ of the favorite. (So a
well-known woman officer has brag-
ged.)

Needless to say, allowing peti-
tioning or campaigning for office is
unheard of in women's organiza-
tions. Such democratic measures
might enable the proletariat mas-
ses to disturb the plans_of‘the
‘self—perpetuating hierarchy.’

And then there's Senior Court,
that personification of dignity, red-
blooded justice, and honor. No
pretense is made there. Each year
the court selects their successors
and announces to the world who
they shall be. Of course, any cor-
relation between the sorority of the
appointees and that of the old
members is purely coincidental.

An excellent example of the lat-
ter situation is seen in this year’s
appointment of a transfer student
to Senior Court, the girl having
been at Pitt just one semester and
having just two committee posts to
her credit, thus completely ignoring
girls who have worked hard in cam-
pus organizations for three years.

It appears that the latter are
members of the ‘wrong’ sorority or
are independent, while the suc-
cessful appointees are members of
Kappa Alpha Theta, the sorority to
which belongs the first female ever
to be president otstudent Congress.

Far be it from me to condemn
playing politics; I do contend, how-
ever, that there is a rule of fair
play even in that game. The W9-
men, it seems, prefer to make their

own rules. i

After all, isit fair that a bunch
of knuckleheads get into office just
because they happen to be the

continues the name of Student Con-

J uniata Foe

In Opener

Pitt’s baseballers go after vic-
tory number three at Schenley Oval
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 when
they take on Juniata in their first
home game.

Coach Ralph Mitterling, whose
Panthers have been idle for a week
because of bad weather, will prob-
ably start the same team that open-
ed at VMI with the exceptions of
outfielders Bobby Lewis and Frank
Papariello.

Lewis, who is recovering from
an ear injury, will be replaced by
George Lowe and Papariello by
either Sam Shapiro or John Fin-
frock. Papariello has been forced
to drop from the squad because of
a back injury.

Juniata, with a 0-2 record, will
field a team of six lettermen and
three holdovers. Coach BillSmaltz’s
Indians have lost to Lycoming, 2-1,
and to Lebanon, 10-3, so far this
season.,

Big chief in the Indian hitting
attack is George Kensinger, who
hit .362 last year. Kensinger, a
first baseman in 1949, will catch.
His battery ‘mate will probably be
Ken Wenger, who won four and lost
two last season.

Probable lineups:

Hurlers Offer

By JOHN MEGELLA I

The last fling promises to be the best fling
for two of Pitt's baseball pitchers.

Seniors Rudy Hudec and Larry Brent, who
wind up their Panther hurling chores this season, are
two good reasons why Coach Ralph Mitterling is opti-
mistic about posting a good 1950 record.

Although both are charged with a loss, Mitterling
thinks the pitchers looked good in losing as well as
in winning a game apiece.

Control Improved

Brent, a lean righthander with a 3-1 record in
1949, has more control and throws harder than he did
last year. A fire-ballet, he has a six-hit victory tc
his credit.. _

The slim pitcher prepped at Shady Side Academy,
where he won seven monograms

A switch-hitter, the Shady Side Sliver watches his
batting average closer than his earned run average.
He prefers to bat lefthanded.

Called ‘Thermometer’

Known as “the thermometer” to teammates,_pre-
med student Brent needs to be shaken before becoming
effective and registers highest in hot situations when
the going is rough.

Mitterling’s other top hurler is Hudec. A knuckle-
ball specialist, the 195-pound righthander expects to
better his 2-4 record of last year. This is his third
season as a varsity pitcher.

A product of Schenley High School, the 6-2 hurler
is a physical education major. He practice teachesat
Arsenal Junior High School and in the off season
plays basketball for St. Mary's Lyceum and plays and
officiates soccer.

V A Slugger, Too

Hudec, who bats from either side of the plate,
batted cleanup in several games last year. He likes
to hit against righthanders.

Not of Scotch descent, the veteran pitcher won’t
be doing his fling to the tune of bagpipes. But if any
music is required Hudec may bring along a Salvation
Army band. In addition to his studies at Pitt, he is

Wildwood
Not for Sale

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Pitt News Sports Editor

Students and faculty members
can put their golf clubs back in the
closet. Apparently Pitt's search
for a country club is not in the
"deal-closing” stage reported by
newspaper accounts over the week-
end.

A leak which escaped at last
weel<’s Western Pennsylvania Golf
Assn. dinner led to stories that the
University was hot after the Wild-
wood course near North Park.

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
was out of town yesterday, but an
athletic department spokesman
said, “Wiidwood is only one of
many golf c’ ‘-sv ‘uich we are study-
ing,f’ Local courses,however,

observers believe that Wildwood
and Highland are the only ones
which might be had.

Wildwood is now officially called
the Hubbard Reservation and is
owned by the Boy Scouts of Ame-
rica. Christopher Gunderson, Scout
Executive of the Allegheny Coun-
cil, said yesterday that “no offi-
cial contact between Pitt and our-
selves has been made. The reser-
vation is not up for sale at the
present time.”

If purchased, Wildwood

functions in addition to
facilities.

Running with the second string

Joe Capp and Bill Reynolds.

Capp, who hails from Newton Falls,
Ohio, was the running star for the

Ove rHoop Treatment

By DAVE POLLOCK _
I Complaints are coming into the News office from Johnstown
Center alumni because the Panther Cubs weren’t allowed to corn-
pete in the National Junior College Basketball Tournament at

Johnstouin 5 Complains R 

Hutchinson, Kansas.

The Cubs, who compiled a 19-7
ecord for the season (listed among
their victims was the Pitt Fresh-
nen), were invited because they
:aptured the championship in the
\Iational Junior College 14th Reg-
onal district.

The Panther Cub, official stu-
dent newspaper of the Johnstown‘
Center, says that the Little Pan-
thers were turned down because of
three reasons:

Shockley Comments
"The instructors felt that some
of the players could not afford
additional time off; a feeling on the
part" of the board members that the
team wouldn’t have a fair chance in
competition with some of the west-

down” edict ranged, according to
The Cub, from "an uneasy silence
among team members to circulation
of a petition by students in a last
minute effort to get the decision
changed."

One of the students said,
son and his clowns were permitted
to make fools of themselves from
coast to coast. Why couldn’t our
boys, who really got somewhere,
be allowed to go to Kansas?”

I

Commenting on the feelings at
Johnstown, Dr. Shockley said, "I'm
pleased rather than irritated that
they were displeased because the
team couldn’t_ make the trip. It
shows that they have school spirit.

“Carl- A

ern t.eams; and the lack of funds’
for the jaunt.”

Dr. Frank W. Shockley, director
of the University’s division, who
met with the Athletic and Educa-
tional cornmittees at Johnstown
Center had this tosay.

"The problem was educational
and not fipancial. We felt that the
team had taken too much time off
for two previous tournaments. I am
not inferring that the players would
have failed, but it would have been
too much.”

Anti-Frat Hat ,
Tossed Into Ring

A new wrinkle appeared on the_
surface of the men’s election race
yesterday, as a small group of stu-
dents made a last-minute anti-
fraternity bid. ,

Three DeSoto llall students and
a radio-announcer journalism stu-
dent inserted a paid advertisement
in today's News, hoping to attract
the interest of n_on-fraternity‘stu-
dents to an all-independent ticket. _

Urging the voters to “get out and
register your protest "against the
high-handed tactics of IF Coun-

posed a ticket,which includes the
13 candidates for Student Congress
and. Men’s Council who have no a

Elevator Operator Hurt
 Electric Shock, Fall

After being involved in an accident which electrocuted his

pi son-in-law, a Pitt elevator operator is now in the McKeesport
~ hospital suffering a possible brain concussion.

Walter Baynham, 49, the operator was helping his son-in-law,
Russell Kautzman, install a television antenna at his Large (Pa.)

trailer park residence. They were
trying to put an antenna on a steel
pole which they were holding, when
the antenna came
into contact with
a high voltage
line.

Kautzman was
electrocuted and
his father-in-law
was thrown to the
groun d. , Trailer
camp residents ad-
ministered first
 aid immediately

Bay“ am in an attempt to
save the son-in-law's life. .

The shock, from the 3200 volt-
line, hurled Baynham to the ground
from th_e roof of the trailer at the
same time: it fatally injured his
son-in-law.

Baynham was helping Kautzman

vision antenna which previously had

A 3 been on a wooden pole. They had

decided to attach it to the higher
steel pole.

found its way to Hollywood, “None

But the Lonely Heart,” which took
the reader to the sordidness of the

London slums an environment very

dissimilar to the green valleys of
Wales where the first book was laid.‘

But before Richard Llewellyn

achieved literary success, he had
been acquainted with several other
fields of endeavor.

After his schooling in England,

he was sent while still in his teens

to Italy where he began learning ho-
tel management, starting from the

bottom in the kitchen. In his spare
time he studied painting and sculp-

ture and learned the fundamentals of
the film industry by working with an
-Italian company.

At the age of nineteen he joined

the British army, thus beginning a
five-year careef which took him to‘
India.

When he returned to civilian life,

he again undertook to learn the meth-
ods of motion picture production by

taking work as an extra player. In

the next few years he worked his

way. up through the British movie
industry to the position of director .

Turned To Writing
A slump in the industry caused
Llewellyn to turn seriously to

a play,

ing his first novel "How Green Was

My Valley,”, the first draft of which

he had written in his days in India.

Mr. Llewellyn recently returned

fromtrip to Patagonia in South Amer- H
ica where he obtained material for a

new book.
