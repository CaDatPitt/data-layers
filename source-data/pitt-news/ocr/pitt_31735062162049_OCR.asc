Pitt Law, Prof Discusses
Nixon's Calif. Subpoena

After another unprecedented act
initiated by John D. Ehrlichman as
he asked a California judge to
subpoena President Richard Nixon.
Pitt Law School’s Richard Seebur-
ger spoke out yesterday about the
legal and historical consequences

John D. Ehrlichman, yesterday,
received his requested subpoena
from a California judge ordering
President Richard Nixon to appear
in court to testify in conjuction with
the ‘burglary of Daniel Ellsberg’s
psychiatrist's office. Pitt_ Law
School's Richard Seeburger spoke
out about the legal and historical
consequences‘of that subpoena.

“I don’t think this is anywhere
near as significant as the subpoen-
as that have been issued thus far,

‘R ” Seeburger said, referring to
C those handed down by Judge Sirica
and the Senate Watergate Com-
mittee.
“Seeburger said, referring to those

handed down by Judge Sirica and
the Senate Watergate Committee.

Service of process is not assured,
Seeburger asserted, raising simi-
larities to the case of John Marshall
subpoenaing President Thomas
Jefferson during the Aaron Burr
trial. _ .

“With this Marshall, decision.
saying, ‘no man can withhold his
testimony,’ the President is still
immune, Seeburger said. “He

vv

has got to be immune from petty

services of process."

The Nixon administration has
been unusually dogged with
problems surrounding subpoenas.

Early last summer. the issue first
arose when the White House
acknowledged it had logs of
conversations between the Presi-
dent and his ex-counsel,John,Dean
III. but announced they‘ would not

. be released to investigators.

Then in October. only a week
before Spiro Agnew's resignation,
the Vice-president obtained court
authority to subpoena various
reporters in an attempt to locate
the sources of news leaks about his
political problems.

In more historic instances. the
President's tapes and documents

‘to withdraw the petition.

Students Contest SG Election

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

A petition has been filed before
the Student Government Elections
Committee (SGEC) asking that the
election of Mike Furick as the next
president be disregarded and his
inauguration postponed.

Filed by five Pitt students on
behalf of Jeffrey Sekerka, a
write-in for the presidency, the
petition was received by Commit-
tee Chairwoman Betty Nelson
Monday evening, two hours before
the deadline for contesting elec-
tions.

Last night, however. Sekerka said
he had instructed the ﬁve students
Appar-
ently this" was being done, but one
student had still failed to sign the
letter of withdrawal.

“I just don’t know if it is worth the
hassles." ‘Sekerka said. ‘ “The
election code is so ambiguous that
you really don’t know ‘what an
article could mean or what they
(SGEC) could draw from it. They
could go on and on."

The petition covered three points,
which the ‘students found “to be a
direct result of the improper
procedure and unauthorized
powers which the SGEC repre-
sented...to be overpowering factors
which affectd the outcome of this

. presidential election.”

Point one read: “The SGEC and

Los Angeles AP--John D. Ehrlich-
man asked Tuesday to have
President Nixon subpoenaed as a
‘material witness in Ehrlichman‘s
burglary and conspiracy trial. The
judge agreed to issue the unpre-
cedented order.
Superior Court Judge Gordon
Ringer ruled that President Nixon

and at the .April 15 trail.

The White House declined com-
mcnt until it receives the order,’ but
a defense attorney said one of
Nixon's attorneys had declined to
have the President appear volun-
tarily and had told him he would
advise Nixon against testifying.

Later White House sources
indicated the President would
decline to appear personally as a
witness. 

“This will be the first time in
history." Ringer said, “that a state

Y’SA’s Tina Adachi says. “The
SDS program is not clear--it zigs
and zags. One day they support

one thing and the next day it’s-

something different."

As surprising as it may seem, the
relationship between those two
left-wing student groups has been
anything but cooperative and
neither group pulls any punches

‘when talking about the other.

“There are fundamental ‘dif-
ferences between the two groups.”
explains Adachi. “The YSA would
never support a candidate from the
Democratic or Republican parties
or anyone who supports capitalism.
The SDS has supported people like
McGovern an even Johnson, who
was a war monger.

“When Kissinger was negotiating
the Vietnam agreement the YSA
was opposed to it because we did
not feel the US had the right to
force the Vietnamese into conces-
sions. Our slogan was ‘Out Now.’
The SDS supported it--their slogan
was ‘Sign Now."

Schneirov criticized the YSA for
“providing misleadership on the

whatsoever to provide this candi-
date with ANY space in the Pitt
News. An article appeared on page
seven only after a persistent
attempt on the part of the
candidate and after initially being
refused."

Sekerka admitted in an interview
last night that this charge is shaky
and it does not carry much weight.
“But the other two are concrete
and still stand valid," he said.

Point two reads: “Blatant misuse

‘of SGEC power.by refusing to

include this candidate in the
Presidential debate held on Jan-
uary 18 in the Litchfield Towers.
This indiscriminate action was
direct violation of Article 5 Section
10 of the election code.”
Responding to the charge, Com-
mittee Chairwoman Nelson said,
“All it says in the code is th-at we
will sponsor a debate, but the
procedure will be up to us. We
found it difficult to identify a
candidate until his name appears
on the ballot." '
-Theoretically, she said, everybody

is a _write-in candidate for
president.
Point three reads: “The SGEC,

after consenting to the use of
write-in stickers, was found to be
advising students not to use them
on election day. As a result the
name was misspelled and some
ballots were not counted by the

campus. The YSA wanted to go to
Washington to demonstrate and we

_felt that would be less effective.”

Both sides criticized each other’s
methods of bringing issues out
to the public. “The SDS has
favored small exemplary actions."
Adachi says. “They're off in the
streets throwing rocks and hoping
their actions will radicalize people
and create insurrection. They
wanted striking janitors to lie down
in front of delivery trucks.”

Schneirov characterized the YSA
as “opportunistic. They raise
demands that cannot be won. They
will adopt any issue that will draw a
crowd but they don't go a step
further and try to win. They have
suckered a lot of students into
getting involved without following
up.

‘Perhaps the two groups differ-
ences can be partly explained by
their different politica foci.

“We think" racism is the most
important issue,” Schneirov said.
“The YSA doesn’t feel it’s very
important at all. They say blacks

“The court is persuaded that the
honorable Richard M. Nixon is a
material witness for the defense...
The court will sign and issue a
pnoperly prepared certificate...
commanding the President, the
honorable Richard M. Nixon. to
testify before this court."

Nixon is sought by the defense to
testify about the establishment of
the secret White House investiga-
tions unit known as the plumbers
and as to what instructions he gave
it in regard to an investigation of
Pentagon papers figure Daniel
Ellsberg.

It is the 197i break-in Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office that caused the
indictments against Ehrlichman,
Liddy and Young. and attorneys
are seeking to show they were only
acting as law enforcement officers
in any action they took.

Ringer also ordered former White
House aide Egil Krogh to testify.
Krogh is to begin serving a

six-month federal prison sentence
next week in connection with the
1971 breakin. He was indicted with

were subpoenated by the Sirica
court in late October. and then by
the Watergate Committee in
December.

Now John Ehrlichman, once a top
Nixon aide, has asked the court to
subpoena the President as a
material witness. It will be the first
time in history that a state court
has directly issued a subpoena to a
president of the United States.

According to Seeburger. who is
regarded by many to be a
constitutional law expert. the fact
that this is a state court issuing the
process is significant. and -aside
from executive privilege, might be
another technical reason for the
president not to respond.

“California can't subpoena me, so

why should they be able to
subpoena Nixon?" Seeburgel
asked. “Nixon is not in California

and the court's sheriffs can only act V

within the state limits.
Seeburger referred back to the

original trial, where Ehrlichman is '

charged with burglary and conspir-
acy in regard to the break-in of

charge in Wasington.
The break-in was carried out by
persons hired by the plumbers.

“Let’s say Ehrlichman says the
President ordered him to commit
burglary and he wants to prove it.
The notion of the Ehrlichman
defense comes in, " Seeburger
explained. “He is still guilty, just
like Ehrlichman was.”

Seeburger has not shifted his
views on executive privilege as he
has documented in previous
interviews.

“There is that certain immunity
in high offices to preserve the
separation of powers. The
President is immune to the service
of process while his is in office.
much like the position of a diplomat
in a foreign country." Seeburger
reported last June.

(But) “impeachment is a differ-
ent process than say the Watergate
investigation. I have my doubts
about their subpoena authority."
he continued.

“However the House (in impeach-
ment investigations) can subpoena,
and if he refuses to acknowledge
them maybethat is an impeachable
offense."

Devils, Demons Excorcized of Symposium.

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Do you believe that a person can
be possessed by the devil?

The question was posed at a
Monday night symposium titled
“God and the Devil,” sponsored by
the University Chaplains Associa-
tion, dealing with exorcism and
demoniac possession.

Rabbi Phillip Sigal, director of
Hillel and" chaplain of the Jewish
University Center, said, “Person-
ally I do not believe in demons and
I do not believe in exorcisms.
However, I do believe that the
power of autosuggestion may be
more powerful than we realize.”

“The existence of demons was
never questioned,” Sigal pointed
out, referring to the Bible and
Talmud. He explained the Bible
had a variety of terms for demons
which were “ambiguous” since a
person who had :had epilepsy was
believed to be possessed.

Father Bryan Summers, a Catho-
lic campus chaplain said, “I believe
that the devil does exist.” As
proof, he pointed out cases in the
New Testament where demons
were cast out of people.

Summers also noted the prayer of
exorcism and annointing which is
said at the beginning of the
Catholic sacrament of Baptism. He
stated, “There wouldn’t be a
prayer in Baptism if demoniac

possession didn't exist."

“Absurd, damaging and wicked,”
was the reply of Rev. Jesse
Cavileer, pastor of the Allegheny
Center Unitarian Church, referring
to quoting Biblical passages as
proof_of demoniac possession.

Cavileer spoke of “exorcising”
people with vitamins and shock
therapy to bring them back into
reality.

As a former worker in a mental
institution, Cavileer said a court
order was issued in one instance to
prevent a priest form exorcising
people in the institution because
the exorcism drove depressed
individuals into a deeper depres-
sion.

Josh Tobin, who represented the
Association for Research and
Enlightenment, discussed posses-

sionusing the readings of the late

Edgar Cayce as evidence.
According to ‘Cayce’s psychic
readings, Tobin said, it is possible
for the body’s gland system to
connect a person with his or her

‘spirit.

Rev. John Szala, chairperson of
the symposium and pastor of the
First Unitarian Church in Shady-
side, refuted theidea of demoniac
possession, saying, “I do not
believe in the physical existence of
demons."

He equated possession with
negative‘ influences in an individ-

A at the ground floor lending

uals life that he or she created.
Sigal called demoniac possession
a means of copping out from the
real problem or a way of “passing
the buck." 4

Cavileer added that there are
elements of superstition in
religion brought into the 20th
century.

In the Catholic Church Summers

 

’9}'';’‘?'’

said, “A priest is appointed by the
bishop in each diocese as an
exorcist." He added that the
identity of the priest who serves as
the exorcist is known only by the
bishop. _

According to Summers, an exor-
cism is performed only by
permission of the bishop and only
as _a last resort after psychological

-‘Dear Editor:

The news media abound with

- speculation concerning the possible

5 impeachment of President Nixon.

- In my opinion, the President should
be impeached because:

j --He established within the
White House his own secret police

' (the “plumbers”) which engaged

‘in criminal acts including burgla-

"ries, espionage. and perjury;

' ‘--He usurped the war-making

I powers of Congress by deliberately

concealing the bombing the Cam-

bodia from Congress and from the

American people, and said he

.would do so again under similar

' ‘ circumstances;

--He authorized the illegal use of

f nents, news reporters, government
employees. and others;
;’_ 1 --He obstructed the admini-
stration of justice by attempting to
limit the FBl's investigation of the
Watergate break-in, by instructing
the Justice Department to drop its
.-case against ITT, and by offering
the directorship of the FBI to the
presiding Judge (Byrne) at the trial
-of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg; .
 .--He has impounded funds
earmarked for social programs and
has refused to spend $3 billion
which Congress has authorized to
be spent on cleaning up rivers and
lakes throughout the US;
--He has authorized the delivery
V‘. of $96 million worth of F-SE jet
fighters to South Vietnam, a
decision which is in violation of the
 January. 1973, Vietnam peace
agreement, and which will push US
military aid to South Vietnam
beyond the $813 million approved
by .Congress for the ﬁscal year.

Shouldn't the President. like any
 other American citizen, be held
accountable for his crimes?

Letters to the Editor

'-‘wiretaps against political oppo-,

by cigarette smoke. Personally, I
find it very distracting and often
lose track of what is going on in the
class as I attempt various methods
of dodging smoke and/or holding
my breath.

Smoking violates the rights of
others. If each student sat in a
closed-in isolated box then no one
would be bothered, but since
everyone has to breathe the same
air I don’t see why I should be
forced to breath cigarette smoke.
Regardless of the reason for the
person to smoke, there can be no
valid excuse as long as that person
is infringing on the rights of others.

In addition to the fact that it is
inconsiderate, an article in Parade
Magazine several months ago
revealed that cigarette smoke may
be more harmful to the non-smoker
who inhales the smoke from an idle
cigarette than to the actual smoker
who only inhales a few times and
then disposes the cigarette. In
light of this fact. I think it is
ludicrous that smokers should have
the privilege of inflicting possible
disease on others. What a smoker
does to his own body is none of my
concern. but when I could be
actually getting lung cancer instead
of the smoker I feel the system is
incredibly warped.

Although the above stated seems
to illustrate the situation, it doesn't
--there is more to come. Smokers
seem to feel that the entire floor
was constructed as-a giant ashtray.
This is in addition to the chairs,
arm rests ‘or whatever seems
suitable at the moment. Was the
tile design on the floor of DL 120
constructed originally with all those
little brown burn spots--and were
the cushioned seats custom built
with burn holes in them?--I doubt
it. And now that the janitors union
has been on strike for the past week
the cigarette butts on the ﬂoors are
getting to be more numerous than
rats at a city dump. For once the
ignorant slobs don’t have someone
to come in and pick up after them,
but does that deter them--certainly
not. The more, the better, I
suppose.

In making my ﬁnal point I would
like to set straight the warped
attitude that smokers have always
bad. When I talk to smokers they
say it is their right to smoke. Well
this is completely backwards. It is
a privilege. not a right. In a public
place a smoker isn't anyone special
and doesn't have any more rights
than others.

The Pitt News erroneously printed
in "The Marathon Makes It’' (Jan
23) that the dance marathon was
sponsored by the Student Govern-
ment Board. It was sponsored and
conducted by the Student Union
Board.

Undoubtedly this letter will
evoke several replies claiming that
some poor soul simply couldn't
take a test without the trustworthy
pack of “cigs" on hand, or how
someone will be suffering with-
drawal cramps without at least one
cigarette. Well. regardless of the
reasons, they are all invalid. It is
either discomfort for the smoker or
discomfort for the non-smoker, and
in this case the smoker should
concede. It's about time the
minority stop making it miserable
for the majority and perpetuate
their vice elsewhere.

Sincerely.

Press Beleasess lllllneai, from Blliaiii

BY GEORGE ZRUST

I've just been looking at press
release PR# 3-74, along with news
bulletins numbers 48 and 50, and
I've come to one conclusion.

There are a lot of nuts in this
world.

Not that I’m prejudiced against.

nuts, please understand. But after
a while, even nuts in overdose can
be very distasteful. You deserve
some explanation.

In the newspaper business, there
are little stories called “shorts", to
be distinguished. of course, from
drawers. But this is irrelevant,
anyway. ‘ '

Shorts are stories about three
paragraphs long. usually announ-
cing an upcoming event or making
some kind of public service
announcement. I

For example, typical shorts may
announce that the Fraternal Order

of Brothers is holding a brother-’

hood ball this weekend, and that all
brothers are invited; or that all
Pennsylvania license plates will
expire tonight, at midnight, effec-
tive immediately.

Newspapers publish these things
for two main reasons: l)as a public
service and 2) to fill space.

Often the information for shorts
concerning events comes. from
press releases issued by groups
sponsoring said events. Frequent-
ly, it is difficult to tell the wheat
from the chaff in these press
releases.

After all, the release is supposed
to sell you on the upcoming event
in order that you'll come, right?

Newspapers, as a rule. try to be
objective about such things.
Besides. if every paper printed
every opinion contained in every
press release, there would be. to
say the least, one hell of a lot of
prejudicial material cluttering our
newsstands.

Enter the nuts.

Organizations exist in this world
that even the best informed of the
best informed probablywould not
know about, unless they worked for
a newspaper.

One group warns of the
imminent takeover of Europe and
North America by one of the US’s
wealthiest families. “Worse than
the Nazis,” warns the’ bold-face
print. ’ _

Another release pleads for action
against a “West Pennsylvania”
prison, located in Virginia, that is

holding and tortufing members of a
left-wing revolutionary youth
group. . '

A third bulletin informs me, as a
student, that I have certain
unalienable rights to fall asleep in
class and be punished for it (but not
for partying the night before, which
is naturally, the, sole cause for
falling asleep in class.)

I'm inclined to believe that

-writers of many press releases are

actually asking newspapers for
genuine help, and not publicity.

$2 .5 Million

Fund Drive

Launched for Libraries

The University Library system,
serving both graduate and under-
graduate departments of the
University and a network of branch
campuses, has announced plans for
the first fund raising campaign in
its l87—year history.

A spokesman for the library
sytems, Leilah Jamison, said this is
the first monies drive on behalf of
the libraries since the University’s
founding in 1787. Not only the
Hillman facility, but the entire
library system will benefit.

Pittsburgh industrialist Joseph M.
Katz, chairman andpresident-of
the Papercraft Corporation, has
agreed to serve as chairman of the
Libraries Campaign, Glenora Ros-
sell, University Library Director,

affirmed. Katz, a patron of the arts ‘

in Pittsburgh, is a Pitt alumnus.

A goal of $2.5 million has been set
by the Libraries Campaign for its
three-year appeal. The drive is
part of an over-all $35 million fund
raising campaign throughout the
University. '

Jamison outlined a three-fold goal
for the campaign. Primarily,
monies from the appeal will be
used to increase and expand the
library’s holdings of books, period-
icals, and publications, to close in
any gaps in the existing collection.

Additional material will be ac-
quired to develop new programs to
supplement services and facilities
presently offered by library system

and an improved sequence of
information handling tools based
on computer technology has been
proposed.

SDS,YSA Differ

(Continued from Page I)

BAS, which was to prsent
candidates for SG under a joint
platform, dissolved. SDS broke off
because “the coalition was too
narrow in scope and only a few
persons from each group partici-
pated," Schneirov said.

Adachi maintains the coalition
split because “both YSA and BAS
support black nationalism--the
right of blacks to control their own
future--while the SDS did not.”
She added that SDS did not have
anyone eligible to run for SG.

As for the future, ‘SDS is planning
a campaign to ban the biology book
Man and the Environment, by

A Arthur Boughey, which advocates a

forced limit to the size of families.

YSA will focus on the 1974 State
elections, with Adachi planning to
run for the Senate opposing
Senator Richard Schweicker.

Adachi also said the YSA plans to
fil suit against the Nixon Admini-

stration inconjunction with'Water- '

gate. Leonard Boudin, who served
as Daniel Ellsberg’s attorney in the
Pentagon Papers case will repre-
sent the YSA.

Black Sabbath
Featured Friday
At Civic Arena

BY DOUGLAS E. GEBHARD

Civic Arena: Feb. 1...8:00

Headlining a show this Friday
night at the Civic Arena is
England's own Black Sabbath.‘
Known to the American press as
the “Metal music" leader in rock
and misunderstood as a black
magic cult. they’ve forwarded
themselves with another hit album
“Sabbath Bloody Sabbath" on
Warner Brothers (BS 2695).

Guitarist Tony Iomni, bass player
Geezer Butler, drummer Bill Ward,
and the distinctive vocals of Ozzv
led us through
“Iron man” days to this l.p. which
Melody Maker has called an
“instant classic.” These guys all
hail from a rough part of
Birmingham and their hard driving
music reflects the attitudes of a
hard working steelman in 1974
England...tough to get ahead and
tougher to fall.

Black Sabbath fans should be
treated to hear this new album live.

Second on the bill will be Spooky
Tooth, another ﬁne English hard
rock band. Most will remember
them with “I Am the Walrus" or
Neil Young's “Don’t Let It Bring
You Down." They’ve gone

Gary Wright, Mike Harrison,‘ Mike

such ex-groupers as Dave Ball

brother Dennis [who has been

Cozy Powell [from Jeff Beck Group
fame], and singer Frank Aiello.
Helping this new group along is the
infamous Felix Pappalardi who
produced their album and along
with his wife Gail Collins wrote a
tune “Looking Through Love’s

D’0rleans did the “fine work.”

Lost Serenade"

Two One-Acts of Studio

BY ADRIAN MC COY

The Tape Recorder is a nasty
psychological thriller in a style
reminiscent of Sorry Wrong Num-
ber. Miss Collins (Mary Jacobs-
Ford) is a secretary for a mediocre
fiction writer. She is alone in his
apartment one evening; the writer
has gone out, and left her the
material he wants her to type on a
tape recorder.

As Miss Collins prepares for her
work, she is the picture of
boredom; staightening up the
cluttered desk, prancing around,
waltzing with a rag doll-all this
suggests the character’s empty
loneliness and boredom. But the
gestures are played self-con-
sciously; she is not a lonely person,
but someone acting like a lonely
person.

When she turns the recording
machine on. the pace quickens.
Ms. Ford's reactions to the
recorded words are precise and
well-timed. The machine suggests
that"s4he make a cup of coffee and
have a cigarette. ’ She_ obeys
blindly. Her natural and subtle
facial expressions create a person-
ality for both Miss Collins and the
machine.

The plot the writer is working on.
is based on their own situation; a
writer and his secretary. who has

spurned his advances. The writer
begins to plot his revenge. As Miss
Collins writes in her s'tenogra-
pher's pad. she begins to show
signs of distress. The machine
seems aware of this and explains
the difference between fact and
fiction to her.

By the middle of the play. neither
Miss Collins or her audience can be
sure of this. Fact and fiction are
merging in disturbing ways.

The situation becomes a psycho-
logical game; the writer/machine
gains dominance over the weak-
ening Miss Collins. The writer’s
plot assumes wierd new twists.
The writer in the story is also
creating a story about a writer/
secretary intrigue. Miss Collins

' now must cope with a story about a

deranged writer who is planning a
murder and writing a story about a
writer who is planning a murder
_and writing a story...

Mary Jacobs-Ford reacts to this
mind boggling development with a
disturbing intensity; she rises
above the somewhat‘ gothic situa-
tion with honesty and grace.

The machine has assumed a
malevolent personality of its own,-.
like the HAL computer in 2001.

mesmerized by the end of the

The tape recorder seems quite

Anachronism is used as a comic
device. Are, we seeing hard-hat

Vienna, or has Schubert managed
to slip into the 1960’s? Either way,
the picture is ridiculous and funny.

This bizarre production has
several rough edges, but they only
add to the total effect. The

taken straight from a Delsarte

are exaggerated to the point of

however, and Kauffman pointed
out that. the Institute is not
designed to be a substitute for
professional mental-health organ-
izations.

The interest groups include
European techniques of self-
exploration, such as Eutonie and
Rolﬁng. Monique Negy, a petite
Frenchwoman, is the only Eutonie
teacher in the United States. She
described Eutonie as being a

“balance of tension, an awareness
of body and senses.” Shying away
from my tentative “Like yoga?,"
she tried to elaborate.

“A lot of people don't realize they
have bodies," she explained, “and
they live in one-dimensional
worlds." Her description of Eu-
tonie session sounded more like a
sensitive body/mind exploration
than a strenuous exercise program.-
I decided that if Monique’s fluid

motions and vivacious good looks =

were indicative of Eu'_tonie's

powers. it must work. _ ‘
Rolﬁng (structural integration) is.

according to Sono’s January

,0

calendar. a “system of physical
education which aims at aligning
the body structure within the
gravitational ﬁeld with the objec-
tive of permitting it to function
more efficiently in terms of
energy...when body structure and
function have been integrated
about a vertical axis, it is believed
that the energy field of human
being can be reinforced by the
gravitational ﬁeld of the earth."

In lay terms, to be rolfed is to be
clobbered. The rolfer, a licensed
practioner, was upstairs with a
client while I sat through the
meeting, and from time to time
cries of pain filtered down through
the floor, setting my teeth on edge.
Since the rolfer and rolfee were
obviously busy, I asked the others,
trying to find out what was
happening. Their answers were
vague, and I gathered'that rolfing
is an intensely personal exper-
ience, something that one can’t talk
about easily.

I moved on to safer subjects,
among them Gestalt therapy.
Mary Garrott. the instructor. told
methat Gestalt is the “realization

‘thatmind, body and spirit are

tional “encounter therapies,"
emphasized the group experience,
and members are _’encouraged- to

to simple terms, so again I
consulted the Sono Calendar.
“The goal of primal therapy is to

those early experiences which were
instrumental in producing neurotic
forms of character development.’f

talking about them, one can learn
to understand, and eventually,

Sono maintains other groups
according to current interest.
Poetry, yoga, black/white com-
munication, workshops for women,
and even massage are offered in
seminars, discussions,
conferences, and workshop week-
ends. Sono is an experiment in
structured democracy. Participa-
tion and communication are its
sustaining elements.

After the. ‘‘I am" has been

the concept of “We Are" as they

whose interests complement and
enrich one another. The Sono
Institute for Human Potential is
dedicated to the “awakening of
human awareness through the
maximization of each individual’s
self-understanding. potentials. and
sensitivity to others."

The people at Sono believe that
answers can come only after the
right questions have been asked.
Maybe the first step toward
developing our human potential to

UCLA is back in its customary No.
1 spot in the Assoicated Press
college basketball poll.

The Bruins, who feel into the No.
2 position for the first time in three
years last week, reclaimed the top
spot by a wide margin today in the
wake of Saturday's convincing
94-75 victory over Notre Dame.
UCLA, 15-1, picked up 51 of 52 first
place votes from a nationwide
panel of sports writers and
broadcasters, and piled up 1, 038
total points.

The Irish, who snapped the
Bruins’ record 88-game win streak
Jan. 19th with a 71-70 victory and
took over the No. 1 position in the
poll last week, feel to third _this
time around. One voter, uncon-
vinced by UCLA's latest victory,
gave Notre Dame the remaining
first-place ballot.

North Carolina State, 13-1 after
beating North Carolina and Pur-
due, moved up one spot to second.
The Wolfpack collected 894 points,
as compared to 864 points for the
third-place Irish. V

North Carolina remained fourth
with 668 points. The Tar Heels,
13-2, followed up their loss to North
Carolina State with a win over
Maryland. Marquette, 16-1 after
topping Long Beach State and
Chicago-Loyola, was up one place
to No. 5 with 565 points.

Maryland, 11-3, dropped one
notch to No. 6 after beating
Canisius and bowing to North
Carolina. Vanderbilt, 14-], main-
tained the No. 7 position with
victories over Tennessee and
Mississippi.

Alabama, 13-2 advanced from No.
9 to No. 8 by virtue of wins over
Kentucky, Georgia Tech and

‘ Wisconsin,

Georgia. Providence, . 15-2.
dropped one spot to No. 9 despite
victories over Boston College and

years, boasting a 216-90 record and
six NAIA post-season tournament
appearances.

In 1972, he was named NAIA
coach-of-the-year for making his
squad the top small-college team in
the country. Aninstitution in the
tiny community nestled in the heart
of deer-hunting country, he left it
all to take over a dismal Pitt
basketball program six years ago.

Five years later, people were
telling Ridl that he should have
stayed in Westminster. They were
saying that his style of basketball
was taken directly out of the 1950s.
Those critics, both fans and
writers, have all joined the
bandwagon now. It’d be difficult
not to.

Buzz Ridl's 1973-74 Panthers have
the longest winning streak ‘of any
major college (15), and are ranked
10th by UPI and 13th by AP. The
Jungle Cats are a shoo-in for a
post-season tournament, the only
question being which one.

Cats Invade Ridl's Alma Mater T onite

But Ridl is not going to be real
happy after the game tonight, no
matter what the outcome. It will
take the upset of the year for Pitt to
lose to Westminster, a team that is
having trouble staying above .500
against teams on its level.

“This is one of the games I look
forward to least," he said at
Monday's basketball luncheon at
Gustine’s Holiday Inn. “I'll be
glad when it's over. A win won't
leave me with a great amount of
satisfaction."

The status of Billy Knight and
Mickey Martin, Pitt’s top scorers
who average 38.4 points and 20.8
rebounds between, is uncertain for
the game; Martin had a bruised
calf muscle which forced him to
miss yesterday’s practice, as did
Knight who is carrying his bruised
shoulder in a sling. A final decision
about their playing may not be
made until game time.

'Westminster defeated Washing-
ton & Jefferson Monday night to
even its record at 7-7. Leading
Titan’ scorer is 6-3 sophomore
guard Biff Kress, who is averaging
12.2 points and 10.1 rebounds.
Another double ﬁgure is 6-0 guard
Mark Wilson with 11.5 points.
The subject of officiating came up
at theiluncheon. Ridl said that he
was in favor of a rule change
whereby nobody would foul out of a

; PITT _NEWS--.Pjqg_e'

game.

five. That way, it would be up to
the coach to decide if it’s worth it to
leave a player in after his fifth
foul."

Penn State head coach Johnny 9

Bach said. after Sunday's loss to
Pitt that a team needed a big man

to be ranked in the top ten. Ridl 
pointed out that Notre Dame and I f
North Carolina, both ranked in the  '-

top ten, have nobody who ismore
than an inch taller than Pitt’s 6-8
Jim Bolla.

Even with both Martin and Knight
out of the lineup, Pitt would be

heavily favored against Westmin- I

ster. Indications at this time are
that both should be ready for
Saturday's game at William and
Mary, and they will be needed
there.

Gropplers Host Clarion

BY G. W. STEVENS

If you are a wrestling-fan, you
may be wondering what has
happened to the Pitt wrestling
team over the past two months.
The squad opened their season on
December 6 when they were
trounced by Michigan at Fitzgerald
Field House. Since that time, the
Panthers have been on the road,
wrestling in several dual meets as
well as a couple of four-way meets.
It has been difficult to say the least,
to ascertain what the team has
accomplished (if they have accom-
plished anything at all).

Well wrestling fans, your troubles
are over. With tonight's 7:30
match against Clarion State, the
Panthers start a string of four home
contests which should determine
just how much the squad has

' learned in route to their current

record of 3-9.

Pitt’s most recent outing resulted
in an overwhelming 39-3 victory at
West Virginia. From this latest
triumph, it appears that coach
Dave Adams’ strategyjust may pay
off. Adams sought the toughest
schedule possible for his young
team, hoping that the competition
would give them the experience
they needed for the season-ending
tournaments. As a result, the
Panthers dual meet record has
suffered considerably. But, Adams
is still very optimistic.

“I think, the fact that we have
wrestled the Oklahoma's, the
Oregon State’s [twice], the Michi-
gan’s and Michigan State's, is
beginning to show its effects now,”
Adams commented. “We are in
good physical condition and we are
aggressive. We'll need that
against Clarion.”

Clarion will bring a most
impressive 18-2 record into to-
night's contest. They have an

extremely talented lineup which
includes three NCAA champions.
But- the Panthers are conﬁdent and
boast some talent of their own.

George Bryant will open, the
match for Pitt against 118-pound
Tom Turnball. Bryant currently
holds a 4-0 record coming off a
term of academic ineligibility. He
will be followed to the mats by
Pitt's freshman sensation, Rande
Stottlemyer, who will fact Craig
Turnbull. the other half of Clarion’s
brother act. Pitt's Bob David (5-7)
will fact Jack Davis at 134, and
these three matches could decide
the Panthers’ chances of gaining a
victory.

Don Rohn, the first of Clarion’s
NCAA champs, will wrestle at 142
against Jeff Weis [1-3]. The
opponent for Clarion’s Sam Baird
has not'been determined yet, but
Adams will probably place fresh-
man Bob Kebr [1-0] in this

150-pound match-up. Ray Dallatore

[5-7], coming off a pin at WVU, will
face Ed Williams at 158, leading
into possibly the biggest match of
the evening.

The 167-pound contest will pit
Wonderous Wade Schalles, two
time NCAA champ, against Pitt's
Wally Morrel. Schalles is a prolific
pinner who has yet to lose this year
but Morrel has won his last four
matches including a pin at WVU.
Morrel has a score to settle with
Schalles, his old nemesis, so
this match should have a revenge-
ﬁlled atmosphere around it.

The 177 contest is still in doubt.
Adams is hoping that Jeff Minerd
will be able to return from an injury
to give the Panthers more
experience against NCAA champ
Bill Simpson. If he is not ready.
Paul Jazenski will get the call.

Either John Achenback [0-1] or
George Calcagnini [2-8-1] will meet

Chris Cole at’ 190 and Carl Roba
[3-7-1] will meet Chuck Coryea,

National College Division runner- , V“ A

up at heavyweight.

Regardless of tonight's outcome.
the Pitt wrestlers should gain a
little more experience from this.

result will be an Eastern champion
or even an NCAA champ.

  Big  Puts shot W

g"e,‘10—TlilEi   January 30, 974

BY RICK STOUFFER

You have to think big. Not big,
BIG! Now picture a blue-striped
shirt. torn at the neck and Dulled
out of shape. Gold wire-rims sit on
the nost while beads of sweat pour
from the face.

The picture is not of some raving
monster but the Big “E.” Big “E"
is Ernie Webster, track coach Jim
Banner's premiere shot put man.
Everyone is familiar with the shot.
It's that small lead ball heavy
enough to give you a hernia.
Weight doesn't bother Ernie.
Throws of 53' have come from his
huge body.

“Right now Ernie is working on
his basics," said Banner. “He was
always hurt when he came up from
football practice (last year he had a
cast on his arm for five months) but
this year he came up healthy."

It takes a big man to throw the
shot with Olympians going around
6’6” and weighing 270. The Big
“E” fits right in at 6-4, 270 and
he’s rapidly getting better. Adding
a foot of distance for every week of
practice is fast work but Ernie is
doing just that.

Talking to Ernie. the impression is
of a very shy but very intelligent
person.

ith Authority

"l’ve been putting the shot since I
was a junior in high school but I
never had the right coaching," he
said. “Even my first years at Pitt
Coach Banner didn’t have that
much time to work with me. But
we have been working more on my
technique and getting my timing
down which is really the most
important thing to a shot putter.
I'm really pleased with his
coaching." -

Ernie was able to compete this
year in track because of a new
NCAA rule letting pros in one sport
compete in another if they wish. “I
really dig the new rule. Being able

to participate in track is really
great. I guesss I’m really luck to
have been around.”

But the pigskin has to be Ernie's
first love. He had a tryout with the
Washington Redskins but was later
cut for “not improving fast
enough." It was tough luck for the
skins as they later asked Webster
to come back, apparently realizing

.$.——

they had made a mistake. But thein,
Patriots saw him, and he was no* "

longer Redskin property.

“I'll be with the Patriots after I
graduateuin April and I have a good
chance of making the team,” he
predicted. “If nothing comes of it,
I'll probably go back to school and
get my degree in law."

Webster finished second at the
Pitt Invitational last week but his
throw did not excite him. “I was
somewhat pleased with my throw
at the meet but I didn’t have any
consistency. I have to work on that
if I want to go to the IC4-A’s this
year. I’m shooting for distance, not
awards.”

“Michigan State is coming up 

two weeks,” Webster continued,

“I hope to be throwing 53‘/2’ by
then.”

Grabbing his hernia-giving ball,
the Big “e” sent it ﬂying, working
for the elusive consistency.

S teelers

Snatch
Swann

The Pittsburgh Steelers named

USC wide receiver Lynn Swann as .

their first choice in the collegiate
draft, which began yesterday.

The Steelers followed with Kent
State linebacker Jack Lambert in
the second round, and Alabama

’A&M wide receiver John Stabl-

worth and UCLA defensive back
Jimmv ‘Allen in the fourth.

Suprisingly, no quarterback was
taken until the third round, when
Dallas grabbed Arizona State
quarterback Danny White. It was
surprising that a player as versatile
as White did not go until them. In
addition to his signal-calling
chores, White is an excellent
punter and a more than adequate
placekicker.

Ed Jones of Tennessee State, a
defensive end, was the first player
chosen, being taken by Dallas.

Penn State had five players
drafted in the first three rounds,
including two first-rounders.
Linebacker Ed O’Neil was surpris-
ingly drafted ahead of Heisman
Trophy W-inner John Cappelletti.
O'Neil was the eighth pick, taken
by Detroit, while Cappelletti went
eleventh to the Rams. Other
Nittany Lions chosen included
tackel Charlie Getty (Kansas City),
guard Mark Markovich (San
Diego), and linebacker Doug Allen.

No Pitt players were taken in the
early rounds, although several are
expected to be drafted eventually.

Will success spoil Tom Richards?

Richards, a 6-0 sophomore from
Murrysville. Pa. began his college
basketball career at Pitt against the
number one ranked team. UCLA
as a freshman. He has since
proven his worth to the team as
quarterback for the
ranked Panthers. However,
Richards‘ success story has not
been a bed of roses.

With success goes the spoil of
victory and Richards admits that he
has become greedy. “Now that we
have begun to win, I just don't
want to lose. Yes," he stated.

“I'm greedy. I want to win the
rest. With each victory. I get
hungrier." «

Richards attributes his personal
success to dedication to the game.
“It may seem artificial," he
ponders, “but, I’m really dedicated
to the game. I love it.” Richards
believes that his hard work
throughout many hot summer days
has resulted in his desire to win
and “be good at winning.

“It's a total feeling when I play
good basketball." stated Richards,
“and because I love to play, I don’t
have to psyche myself. I’m just
naturally psyched."

Richards comes from a basket-
ball family and has been playing
organized ball since the fourth
grade. During the summers
Richards was on the court just after
dawn and would return home for
dinner. “I would play at least eight
hours a day. concentrating on the
fundamentals of ball handling and
ball hawking."

Heralded as an offensive-minded
player, Richards- was immediately

sophomore guard Tom Richards.

switched to a point guard at Pitt.
“My responsibilities are to get
everybody shots, keep the ball
moving and be a messenger for the
coach.” The aspect he enjoys most
is the fact that he is always in the
game.

‘'I wouldn't want to be a
shooting guard again." he" said.
Richards measures his success of a
particular game by his number of
assists. He currently leads the
team in assists with 54. “We have
an unselﬁsh team. If somebody
has a better shot, I give it to him.
This has been the secret to our

success." »
In 1972, as a senior in high
school. Richards averaged 32

points per game;-was a member
of the All-State team and was cited
by Streets and Smith magazine as
one of the top 50 recruits in the
nation. “I chose Pitt." he said.
“for four reasons: sincere
recruiting; the coaches and play-
ers; the high academic standards;
and. becuase they made me feel
wanted.“

Richards has a few unique
superstitions. “Against Rutgers,”
he explained [which was the
beginning of Pitt’s 15 game
winning streak], “I buttoned my
warm-up jacket except for the first
and last button. Since then I button
my jacket the exact same way.”

“Richards has also reversed the
order of his socks. “Last year I

 

the white ones. This year it's the
other way around and so is our

record." The only clothes Richards ’

won't wear was the combination he

wore to West Virginia. which is 

Pitt's only defeat this season.

“I'm always optimistic. The only I I A

time I get down is after a bad
game." he stated. Richards
believes the Panthers could play
the top teams in the nation with
success.
attentions to receiving a post-tour-
nament bid. “Right now I hope for
a 25-] season and then an NCAA
berth." »

The basketball courts at Trees’

Hall will be tied up almost
completely by intramurals for the
next ﬁve weeks. according to
intramural director Leo Bemis.

“Free play is at a minimum," he
stressed. He added that the Field

House court can be used when it is I. I

not preempted by a varsity event or
practice. The IM program boasts‘
133 teams and nearly
participants. and Bemis had to
reschedule many games due to the‘
strike.
