CWO not
happy with
treatment
of assault

By Chris Kocher
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Campus Women’s
Organization denounced the
casual treatment of an inde-
cent assault at Pitt, during
their meeting Thursday.

“A lot of people who never
read the police blotter [in
The Pitt News] would never

know about it,” said
Stephanie Sudzina, CWO co-
president.

The assault, which

occurred at a fraternity on
Sept. 10, involved the female
calling campus police to
report the incident.

Sudzina said a campus
police representative told her
the assault occurred at the
Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)
house. ’

“I mean, how serious was

it that she had to call the

police?” Scott Dolin, CWO
co-president, asked. “_We’re
not told.”

Sudzina said she had‘

talked with the Department
of Public Safety to learn
more about the assault, and

that it appeared the fraternity I

was getting off “with a slap
on the wrist” by having their
social privileges temporarily
taken away.

» “Which means they can’t
have a party for awhile,” she
said, in an attempt to point
out the inadequacy.-

Sudzina encouraged those
at the meeting to write or
phone the public safety
office and said she would
continue to look into the
matter. A

Also discussed was a rob-
bery and assault on the
Cathedral of Learning lawn
on Sept. 9 which prompted
Public Safety to issue “crime
alert” ﬂyers around campus.

Better study areas, well-lit_ -

sidewalks and pathways and
an escort service were
among the suggestions from
members to improve campus
safety.

Sudzina said Pitt is one of
the few urban schools not to
have an escort service.

“I would like to have the
right to walk alone,” she
added.

To help students protect
themselves in Oakland,
Student Government Board
member Elizabeth Mania
announced a self-defense
seminar to be held this
Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in

Debaters discuss gun control issue

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

Against Violence, and Michael Slavonic,
member of the National Rifle Association

Ten minutes prior to Thursday night’s gun
control debate sponsored by the American
Criminal Justice Association, Lambda Alpha
Epsilon, the presence of empty chairs gave a
sense of the lack of concern the campus

appeared to have on the issue.

But by the 8:30 p.m. start, the chairs and the
William Pitt Union’s Kurtzman Room were
filled, mainly by members outside of the
University of Pittsburgh community who had
come to hear the arguments of Kenneth

showed up.

Steinberg, vice president of Pennsylvanians

Board of Directors.

“The subject today would beneﬁt everyone,
because it involves everyone,” said Mario
Deluliis, president of Lambda Alpha Epsilon.

Deluliis said he wasn’t sure why so few stu-
dents showed up, but because advertising for
the event was on such a large scale, from
posters to mentions on the radio and in the

newspaper, people from outside the university

“As the people in the lines keep asking ques-
tions, it gets more heated as it goes along,”

Eleven-year-old
Veneski danced across a stage

in the Cathedral of Learning-

Commons Room Saturday.

The performance was part of
an Ukrainian folk dance. His
performance was just one of
many festivities which occurred
this past weekend at the
Ukrainian Renaissance Fair.

Held Saturday and Sunday,
the fair celebrated Ukrainian
life and culture. The fair has run
armually for 13 years. The festi-
val was filled with Ukrainian
performances, food, jewelry,
clothing and various other
Ukrainian artwork.

“We are very proud of our
Ukrainian music, embroidery,
Easter eggs and dancing,” said
Michael Komichak, chairman
of the Ukrainian nationality
room and the announcer for a
bilingual, Ukrainian radio show
on station WPIT.

The Commons Room, deco-
rated with brightly colored
draperies, was filled with peo-
ple, the aroma of food and
tables scattered in order to form
a Yarmorok or Ukrainian mar-
ketplace. The festiva1’s partici-
pants were guests of the
Nationality Classroom Program
headed by Maxine Bruhns.
Ukraine first received its
nationality room in June, 1990.

Thefestival participants were
all members of various
Ukrainian organizations from
the Greater Pittsburgh area.

“The festival is the one
Ukrainian event,” said Michael
Jula, chair of the Ukrainian
Festival Committee, “which
encompasses the entire
Ukrainian community in
Pittsburgh. It is unique because
I can not think of one Ukrainian
church that is not involved.”

Participants in the festival
ranged from three-year-old
dancers to sixth generation par-
ticipants.

1 Ukrainian festival brings culture to Pitt

“It pleases me that young
people are interested in sharing
Ukrainian culture with other
Ukrainians and other cultures,”
said Kornichak. Pitt’s Ukrainian
Students’ Organization also
largely contributed to the event.

The Commons Room was
filled with performances by eth-
nic music and dance ensembles
including the Kiev Junior
Ukrainian Dance Ensemble,
International Slavic Christian
Alliance Choir, Pittsburgh

Ukraine Cultural Trust Choir,.

Kazka and Ridna Shkola.

“The kids enjoy performing
here. It gives them a chance to
perform for the Ukrainian com-
munity as well as non-
Ukrainians,” said Artistic
Director Natalie Kapeluck of

the Kiev Junior Ukrainian -

Dance Ensemble.

According to Jula, any mone-
tary profit will benefit the vari-
ous Ukrainian churches of
Pittsburgh. Many ethnic art-

AUSTIN, Tex. — A former
accountant at the University
of Texas, Lynn Deer, has been
accused of embezzling over
$300,000 from the school.
Deer, who is being charged
with first—degree felony,
resigned as an accountant in
the College of Fine Arts after
she was arrested in January.
She is accused of ordering

checks made out to people
who had done no work for the
university. She then forged
their signatures and deposited
the checks into her bank
accounts. — The Chronicle of

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. —
Editors of the Regent
University Law Review have
agreed not to distribute an
issue of the publication
defending activists who kill
doctors at abortion clinics.

The university was founded
by the televangelist Pat
Robertson. Douglas Cook,
faculty advisor to the student-
run law review, said the deci-
sion had been made at the
request of the author, Michael
R. Hirsh.

The article was written and
accepted for publication
before an anti—abortion
activist shot and killed a doc-
tor and his security escort
outside a Pensacola, Fla.,
abortion clinic in July. Cook
said that because of the
killing, the article’s timing

was not appropriate. — The

You don’t have to believe me

Steinberg said the Supreme

said there is no guarantee of an
individual’s right to own a

Arsenal reductions

President Clinton ordered a reduction in nuclear-deployment
weapons last Thursday. After a 10-month review of nuclear policy,
Defense Secretary William Perry announced that the number of
Trident submarines would be reduced from 18 to 14 and the number
of B-52 strategic bombers from 94 to 66. It is hoped that Russia will
respond in kind to the cuts, which are primarily intended to save
money. Reportedly, Clinton will personally ask Boris Yeltsin, at a
meeting next week in Washington, to reciprocate with similar reduc-
tions. . -'

This is an important step in American nuclear and military power.
In the wake of the Cold War (even during the Cold War), the U.S.
military has been far larger than it needs to be. We could cut our mil-
itary force in half and still maintain our unquestioned world military
supremacy. Our nation, as most Congressional members repeatedly
remind us, is in dire need of expenditure trimming. The military is
one of, if not the most, bloated federal expense. Clinton promised in
his _campaign to cut the military, and this reduction in nuclear arse-
nals is a step in the right direction. Hopefully the president and the
Defense Department will not stop there.

Also, this is an important step away from the gridlock which harn-
pered nuclear reductions during the ColdWar. By independently
reducing our nuclear arsenal, the United States is showing its will-
ingness and commitment to the world, rather than wasting time
bickering over who would reduce first as we did during the Cold
War.

Too much Juice

Urgent newsﬂash!
Breaking story!
9 “Ladies and gentlemen, we are back with the latest update on

J the O.J. Simpson trial. When we last broke in, five minutes ago,

prosecutor Marsha Clark was taking her third drink of water in
the last 20 minutes, a sure sign of the pressure which the Juice’s
defense team is putting upon her. However, we now have a sign
that perhaps Mr. Simpson is breaking under the pressure. We
have exclusive footage of the former football star actually pick-
ing his nose in public! For O.J., who has spent so much of his

9 life in front of the cameras, to forget his manners and commit

such a gaffe in public is a sure sign of the stress which has been
placed upon him. In an exclusive interview ...”

Enough already! The rampant recycling of news stories, (of
questionable newsworthiness) long a problem, is now seemingly
increasing exponentially before our eyes. And it is not just O.J.
stories. The local Pittsburgh media, commended by us not so
long ago, is beating the Flight 427 story into the ground, con-
stantly reminding family members of their anguish, by continu-
ally reporting on the now nonexistent story. Do we really need
to be told that now 87 bodies have been identified as one news-
ﬂash reported the other night?

A message therefore to the nation’s media — stop the insani-
ty! Please find some new stories, we are getting sick of the same
old story.

announced
its plans to
build a $650
million “his-

Tony park” on the
Dickensheets outskirts of

the Manassas 8

Civil War battlefield in the
hills of northern Virginia.
Though the park is not sched-
uled to open until sometime
in 1998, it sparked a tremen-
dous controversy that is cer-

Disney wants to spit on the
graves of our founding
fathers.

That northern Virginia is
abundant in history is undeni-
able despite what Disney’s
chairman, Michael Eisner,
has said. He has asserted that
the land Disney has acquired
“is not in the middle of an
historical area” (The

In an attempt to cover up its
greed, Disney is trying to sell
their park idea by saying that
it is just what northern
Virginia needs to further
develop the region. I would
challenge that premise. Our
country has a history of only
218 years, and to strip our
heritage away from future
generations by surrounding

When a

many detractors say that the
company will be unable to
control growth on its 3,000-
acre site and that this growth
will overwhelm the small
town of Haymarket with
thousands of cars, not to
mention endless strips of
hotels, gas stations, fast food
restaurants and malls.

George Will has eloquently
stated that America has many
landscapes, “but none is more
drenched in the history of
heroic idealism than
Virginia’s Piedmont region, a
perishable window on the
past, a place which, ‘were
Jefferson and Washington and
Lee to revisit it, would
be comfortably familiar to
them” (The Washington Post,
July 7, ‘94). C. Vann
Woodward of Protect Historic
America struck a similar
theme when he said that
“this part of northern Virginia
has soaked up more of the
blood, sweat, and tears of
American history than any
other area of the country. It

educate our children on
American history than Eisner
obviously was. Besides
Manassas, there are 17 other
Civil War battlefields within
a 30-minute drive of the pro-
posed Disney site.

At the heart of this debate
should be whether we as
Americans want a theme park
of any kind on what arguably
is the ‘most sacred of
America’s treasured historical
sites. Every year, millions
of families pack up their
cars and head to northern
Virginia for a vacation that is
about more than just relax-
ation, it’s about getting in
touch with our past. The bat-
tlefields of northern Virginia
are places where parents can
teach their children about
what many of our schools
have so miserably failed

fabric is very much in doubt.
Our children deserve to know
the sacrifices that were made
by past generations to make
our country great.

Disney needs to decide how
it wants to be judged in the
future, as a protector of histo-
ry or as just another one of its
many destroyers. Disney has
in the past been something
that America could be proud
of by the way that many of its
movies have not only enter-
tained our children, but at the
same time, taught them as
well.

Disney is a part of
Americana, and it would be a
disaster if one misguided and
uninformed CEO let greed
and a lack of our nation’s his-
tory destroy that reputation.
The logical decision for
Disney to make is to take
their mouse someplace
else and leave our history in
tact. J

Martin
missing
threat in
offense

fter
As
1ISt
game of the
season, Pitt
(1-3) looked
like it was
headed in the
right direc-
tion. The
Panthers were
going to be a
team with one of the best run-
ning backs in the nation in Curtis
Martin.

But after playing two straight
games with Martin out due to
injuries, Pitt looks like a team
without an offensive threat. ,

“I thought until today we had
been making progress,” Panther
head coach Johnny Majors said,
referring to Saturday’s 21-9 loss
to Boston College. “But 'I
thought today, in the first half,

5 was some of the worst play I’ve

seen in a long time. Wewere
poorly prepared, poorly orga-
nized and we executed poorly.”

Without Martin, Pitt played as
if they didn’t have any intentions
of winning the game from the
start.

Despite the defense giving up
21 points in the first half against
BC, it was the lack of leadership
by the offense that cost the
Panthers another game. ,

“It’s frustrating to be in a posi-

, tion to win a football game and

not come out on top,” Pitt run-
ning back Billy West said. “We
needed to get into the end zone.
Our defense was putting us in
the position we needed. We
needed to get into the end zone,
and we couldn’t capitalize.”

The Panther running game,
which is supposed to be one of
the best in th&Big East, didn’t
prove to be the difference in the
game.

West, running in the place of
Martin, was the only bright spot,
scampering for 170 yards on 28
carries. The rest of the Panthers
carried the ball seven times for
minus 45 yards. Overall, Pitt
rushed the ball 35 times netting a
meager 125 yards, averaging a
dismal 3.6 yards per carry.

To say Pitt’s offense was
nonexistent would be an under-
statement. It was evident the
Panthers missed their big play-
maker.

Without Martin in the back-
ﬁeld, the Panthers had to rely on
the arm of quarterback Sean
Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald is not the type of
player who will decide the out-
come of the ballgame. Going
into Saturday’s contest, he was
one of the worst quarterbacks in
the conference statistically.

Eagles soar
Panthers’ scoring woes continue,

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

When judging the play of the
rebuilding Pitt football pro-
gram, the popular measuring
stick used hasn’t been wins or
losses, but progress.

In Pitt’s first three games -
the thrilling 30-28 near upset of

Texas, the
30-16 win
over Ohio

University ,

that broke

a 10-game

home win-

less streak,
and the spirited 27-3 loss to the
overpowering Ohio State
Buckeyes —— the ‘Panthers
showed marked improvement
over last year’s club.

But save for a strong defen-
sive stand in the second half,
the Panthers (1-3) looked a lot
like the forgettable 1993 club in
losing to Boston College 21-9

7 Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

“I thought up until today, par-
ticularly the first half, we had
made progress. I firmly believe
that,” coach Johnny Majors
said. “I thought today, the first
half was some of the worst play
I’ve seen in a long, long time.”

The Eagles scored on three of .

their first four possessions,
using a 13-minute and 12-sec-
ond span to score all the points
they would need to beat the
Panthers. 9

On the opening drive of the

game, BC drove into Pitt terri-
tory on the strength of five
David Green rushes for 31
yards. Then on fourth-and-one
from the Pitt 41, tailback
Justice Smith took a delayed
handoff and rushed untouched
around left end and down the
sidelines, before absorbing a hit

their first drive with a 44-yard
field goal from David Merrick
making it 7-3.

On the ensuing BC drive,
Pitt’s Denorse Mosley inter-
cepted a pass from true fresh-
man quarterback Scott Mutryn.
But the Panthers’ offense failed
to capitalize, going three and

ing onto the end zone cone for

the touchdown.

The BC running attack
seemed to catch the Pitt defense
off guard. ‘

“I know personally, I thought
they were going to come out
throwing a little bit more,” line-
backer Tom Tumulty said.

Kansas, falls to No-

2 Cornlwskers

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor ’

Two and a half weeks after playing the No. 1 team in the country,
'the Stanford Cardinal, the Pitt volleyball team faced the No. 2
Nebraska Cornhuskers last weekend at the Nebraska Tournament.
The Lady Panthers dropped three consecutive games against
Nebraska on Friday, but rebounded the next day to beat the Kansas

J ayhawks.

“It’s a great opportunity,” Annemarie Memagh said about playing
the two top teams in the nation. “Because you’re in that situation
where you have nothing to lose, there’s absolutely no pressure.”

Although Pitt (7-5) split the tournament, its mission was accom-

plished-

“We beat Kansas, which was our main goal for the weekend,”
Memagh said. “That’s why we went to the tournament, and also to

get better against Nebraska.”

Pitt looked as though it was going to make quick work of the
J ayhawks (3-11) after it won the ﬁrst game, 15-5. But after the first
game, Pitt exchanged alternating wins in the next four games, 11-

15,15-6,11-15,15-7.

“I thought we were pretty average against Kansas,” assistant
coach Brian Begor said. “We were a little disappointed. We were
very irresponsible with the ball and made a lot of unnecessary

attacking errors.

“But we definitely feel good about winning the match against a

good opponent.”

Carrie Thornton led the Pitt attack with 16 kills, with Sara
Mitchell right behind her, putting away 15 kills. Mitchell also had

Pitt cirops in Big East

 

By Vicki Geubtner
Staff Writer

The hot sun wasn’t the only
thing beating down on the Pitt
soccer team as they lost 1-0 to
Big East rival Villanova yes-
terday, dropping their record to
3-3 overall, 0-2 in the Big
East. ,

- “I can handle when a team
beats us, but I can’t handle
when we beat ourselves,” cap-
tain Bobby Dyer said.

The Wildcats’ (3-4,1-1) solo
goal came unassisted by fresh-
man Barry Smith after he
drilled it past goalie Kirk
Brodows at 21:30 of the first
half.

‘‘I didn’t clear it far enough,
and he put itback in right
away,” Brodows said, “I
should have saved it.”

The Panthers had a chance
to tie four minutes before the
half on a penalty shot by Mike
Dyer that went far left of the
goal.

Mike Dyer usually doesn’t
take those shots, but Eric Prex
was out of the game.

“There was no one else in
there who's ever taken a penal-
ty shot for us,” Pitt coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “(Dyer) was

promptly nailed Washington,
forcing a fumble that Shorter
would recover 14 yards upfield
at the Pitt 19.

On the next play, Mutryn
threw complete to wide receiv-
er Kenyatta Watson in the far
left corner of the end zone for
BC’s final score with 13:38 left
in the first half.

But Pitt cut the BC lead to

away from the BC charge. Pitt
failed on its two-‘point conver-

\ ' sion attempt.

. The Panthers appeared to be
in the game, but penalties and
poor pass protection plagued
the Pitt offense throughout the

rest of the game.

After a Tumulty interception
that he returned to the BC 48
with under two minutes left in
the first half, Pitt was in posi-
tion to cut the BC lead further.

“People are just laying their

their ends,” Majors said. “We

the man. I have confidence in
Mike,” Luxbacher said.

He also stressed the idea that
“Prex can’t do it all.” .

“We need everyone to play
solid and one or two people to
come up big every game,”
Luxbacher said. “It’s not get-
ting done with the guys on th
field,” he added. 1

The on-going controversy

over the starting goalie posi- f

tion between Kirk Brodows
and Adam Spitzer is still
“unsettled,” Luxbacher said,
“as are 10 other positions on
the field.”

Three shots on goal for Pitt
by John Lopus and two a piece
for Dean Astorino and Todd
Graf weren’t converted into
goals for the Panthers either.
Each shot was seemingly
directed toward Wildcat goalie
Aleko Zeppos.

Zeppos had eight saves com-
pared to Brodows’ seven.

Bobby Dyer alluded to the
fact that some changes have to
be made in order for Pitt to
start winning again.

“We need to go out and kick
people and don’t give a shit

‘ who it is,” Bobby Dyer said.

Offensively, Sarah Mikla led

But unlike the Kansas match,
Pitt’s team attacking percentage

“We competed really hard

One reason why Pitt might
