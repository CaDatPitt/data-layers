Herberf Speaks on War Supreme Court Grants Right to Women

‘x

by GEORGE STEITZ

Charges of war atrocities are
not uncommon, but when they
come from a Lt. Colonel in the
U.S. Army. a man who was the
most decorated G1 in the Korean
War, they become sensational.

Anthony B. Herbert. a retired

Lt. Colonel. will be featured in a.

lecture/discussion. sponsored by
the’ Student Government and
WYDD radio tonight at 8 p.m. in
David Lawrence Hall. Herbert
_will relate the story told in his
7‘}eently published book,\Soldier.

:1». Herbert’s difficulties began

shortly after his arrival in -Viet
Nam as an Inspector General of
the Field -173rd Brigade. Herbert
claims he uncovered derelections
of command responsibility and
later as a commander of the Bri-
gade’s Second Battalion , reported

eight atrocities involving Ameri-
can troops.

Herbert was removed from his
command, and_an efficiency re-
port filed by the Deputy with the
Brigade Commander’s approval
charged him with lack of loyalty

and moral. courage and recom- .3, _ v_
Born in Hermanie, Pa., Her-

bert attended and received a B.A. ‘

mended that he never be given an-
other battalion command. When
he left his batalion it had the high-
est efficiency rating in the Bri-
gade.

 

In 1971. Herbert charged the
commanding officers of the 173rd.
Major General John Barnes and
his Deputy Colonel, J. Ros_s
Franklin, with attempting \t0 cov-

er up the war atrocities. He also

charged that his relief from com-
mand and his.ruinous efficiency
rating were a result of his an-
nouncement of the atrocities.
Subsequent investigation re-
vealed that seven of Herbert’s
eight allegations had been accur-

— ate. Robert F. Froehlk, Secretary

of the Army, ordered the efficien-
cy report expunged from Her-
bert’s record and raised his’per-
manent" army rank from captain
to major.

Herbert continued to press for
aimore complete investigation of

_-his atrocity charges and his relef

from command. “He claims that
subsequent harassment and hum-
iliation forced_him to resign from
active duty. ’ A

Herbert is expected to release
previously unpublished documents
at the Pitt lecture Monday.
WYDD has scheduled a discussion
of those unpublished papers on
Jan. '28 at 8:35 a.m. and a tape of
Herbert’s lecture will be broad-
cast at the same time on Feb. 4., ‘

and an M.A. in English literature.
Within a year he plans to com-

. plete his Ph.D. in Psychology.

‘ﬂfiikct. At that time the Commission

was established to deal with race

discrimination. In 1969, it began-

to handle sex discrimination.

The Commission, a state agen-
cy, has its headquarters in Har-
risburg, along with three region-
al offices in Pittsburgh, Harris-
burg, and Philadelpha. Its 11
commissioners are appointed by
the Governor.

“The main purpose of an inves-
tigation in the case of sex, dis-
crimination is to apply the com-

plaint to a male. For example, we .

for the same job. would be asked
these same questions. That would
be an example sex discrimina-

Gwinn noted some acts of dis-
crimination in employment that
are illegal. One of these states an
employer cannot refuse to hire a.
woman if she is married and has
children unless the refusal can
also be applied to men.

“An employer, according to the
Act can’t refuse to hire a female
because she’s pregnant. One of
our biggest issues is childbirth
leaves. The Act says the date for
the commencement of the leave
is up to the woman and her ‘physi-
cian: The date of return is also
up to» them, with a reasonable lim-
it, which is around six months.”

WASHINGTON‘ (AP)—The Su-
preme Court Monday granted
American women the right to

' have medical abortions during the

first six months of pregnancy.

The state may -interfere with
this "right of privacy” only in ap-
proximatelythe lastthree months.
when the unborn child is devel-
oped enough to live outside the
mother, the court held 7 to 2.

The ruling struck down a Texas
law that made it a crime for a doc-
tor to end a pregnancy except “for
the purpose of saving the life of
the mother.” Thirty other states
have similar laws. All presum-
ably will become invalid“

At the same time, the court
disapproved, 7 to 2, key provi-
sions of a Georgia law that allow-
ed medical abortions only to resi-

i dents of the state and said two ad-

ditional doctors must concur with
the woman's physician. '

The court said this unconstitu-
tionally kept citizens of other
states from using Georgia’s medi-
cal facilities and unduly restricted
the rights of pregnant women.

Similar laws in 13, other states
will become invalid as a result.

Justice Harry A. Blackmun
spoke for the majority in rulings
that took more thantwo years to
reach. His opinions, running 72
pages, were supported from medi- V

Courses 5

The care of plants and pets. sex-

‘ual and aggressive behavior. and

culture and change in Japan in the
1970s are among the diverse sub-
jects to be explored in 40 inform- \
al courses offered by the Univer-
sity‘s Community Seriesthis win-
ter. ‘

Administered by Pitt's School
of General Studies, the series is
designed for adults who want to
continue their education without
the demands of a regular degree
program. The courses are taught
by scholars and professional peo-

» ple in the community, as well as

by some of the University’s most
distinguished professors.

A special feature of the Com-
munity Series thiswinter will be
a series of eight classical anthro-
pological films, moderated by Dr.
Leonard Plotnicov, professor of
anthropology and former 1/ chair-
man of the department. The films

‘ provide information about people

and cultures around the world
from Alaska to Africa. 6

Another new course, "Japan.

' Culture and Change in the 1970s,"

examines the apparent paradox of
traditional Japan as an economic
and political giant. The course.
which meets on Monday evenings,
will be taught by Dr. L. Keith
Brown, chairman and professor
of anthropology.

"Sexual and Aggressive Beha-
vior“ will include a series of 10

alectures on topics ranging from
 they-ietrea_t_'ment of-, sexual“, offenders f
   

I ‘1?a;9,€..2,); A

 
  

cal, religious, and philosphical as
well as legal references.

Justice Byron R. White and a

William H. Rehnquist dissented.
White said, “The court apparent-
ly values the convenience of the
pregnant mother more than the
continued existence and develop-
ment of the life or potential life
which she carries.

But Blackmun, for the major-
ity, said the state could cause a
pregnant woman considerable '
harm by not allowing her to have
an abortion. 1

Additional and unwanted chil-

dren could force a distressful life

upon her, he said.“‘Mental and
physical health may be taxed by

child care.”. wrote the 63-year-

old former house counsel for the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

For single, pregnant women, he
said, there are “the additional
difficulties and continuing stigma
of unwed motherhood."

On the other hand, Blackmun

‘said, the mortality rate for wom-

en having abortions in the early
stages of pregnancy apparently

A-wards Available For 
Summer 1 Study Abroad 

are as low or lower than the rate
for normal childbirth.

Therefore, Blackmun said,

while a pregnant woman does not ~
have “an absolute constitutional .

right to an abortion on her de-
mand,” the state cannot inter-
fere with the judgment of the

woman and her doctor in the first  

three months.

In the second three-month per-
iod, all the state may do, he said,

is to regulate abortion procedures IE5‘ V

in ways that are “reasoriably re.-

lated to maternal health,” such

as supervising the licensing of 1 ii

physicians, clinics, and hospitals.
An Associated Press survey

showed ‘state officials were not
immediately sure of the impact of

the ruling. Pro-abortion groups ‘

predictably expressed pleasure
with the court action; anti-abor-
tion associations were: dismayed.-

U.S. Rep. Sarah’ Weddington of

ters in the United States are now
utilizing the technique.

Much of the interest in acupunc-
ture stems from the publicity sur-
rounding Nixon’s trip to China.
During that visit several doctors
made films of open heart surgery
performed under acupuncture an-
esthesia.

Tenicela complained that the
western doctors were not permit-
ted to follow the pre- and post-op-
erative care of these patients, and
believes that the patients might
have been subjected to some
other treatment without the Amer-
can doctors’ knowledge.

Although the Red Chinese re-
port that 80 per cent of their op-
erations are «._performed using
acupuncture, Tenicela noted that
an authority in Hong Kong claims
that in reality it is only used in 15
per cent of the surgery.

Acupuncture has been popular
in China since the revolution.
when few qualified western doc-
tors were available. “After the
revolution Mao Tse Tsung had to
decide whether to drop acupunc-
ture as folklore or develop it into
a science,” Tunicela stated. “Mao
chose the second course.” -

While in the Orient Tenicela
submitted himself to the proce-
dure used to produce anesthesia
forvarious types of oral surgery.

He reported that several needles
were inserted into his foot and his
hand after a period of indoctrina-
tion, but that the procedure had
absolutely no effect. The doctors
told him that this was probably
because his target areas were
slightly different from those of
the average Chinese.

According to acupuncture ex-
perts the target areas range from
one-tenth to three-tenths of an
inch in length. The Pitt anesthe-

 siologist stated that the technique

does not involve hypnosis, be-
cause acupuncture has also been
demonstrated in rabbits, horses.
and elephants.

Tenicela reported that no effort
is used to wash or sterilize the
needles, which are reused many
times. One practitioner of acu-
puncture demonstrated that the
stainless steel needles were ster-
ile by introducing them in a cul-
ture medium. The Chinese main-
tain thatstainless steel is able to
destroy the microorganisms
which it contact-s. '-

The philosophy behind acupunc-
ture has no basis in western ana-
tomical and physiological theory
Tanicela added. The Chinese be-
lieve that health is achieved
through the balance of .“good and
bad energy” flowing through cer-
tain pathways, or meridians.

These “meridians” often follow
irratic to
western scientists. For instance,
acupuncturists believe that if
something is wrong with the liver,
the origin of the problem maybe
the toes,

Tenicela indicated that some
members of the anesthesiology
department are experimenting
with the technique, using one an-
other as subjects, but emphasized
that the University is not paying
for acupuncture research. He be-
lie‘ves that careful research
should be conducted by scientists
in medical schools to determine
the validity of the method, rather

than permitting quacks to claim‘

expertise in the field.

Of the 19 acupuncture experi-
ments completed at Pitt, only
three have been successful, ac-
cording to Tenicela.

But Tenicela added that he still
plans to “keep an open mind. I
do not take this as a failure . . .
we know that we cannot produce
the same effect in all people using
the same technique.” He conclud-
ed by saying that the results of
acupuncture experiments must be
reproducable before they can be
accepted as scientific fact.

sponsibility and pay.

“This clause of the Act is based
on the fact there is no more as-
. be tem-
porarily disabled than a female.
A male could break an arm and
have to take a disabilitv leave as
a woman would if/she were preg-
nant." ' i

Gwinn cited an example in a
California city where men are
given a two-week “paternity
leave.”

The Commission received al-
most as many complaints from
men regarding sex discrimina-
tion as women. It is illegal to dis-
criminate against a man on the
basis of the length of his hair as
long as thereis no similar rules
for women.

"Also when the State Police al-
lowed women in the force the

‘height requirement was lowered

to 5'4”. But it was left at 5'8"
for men. This is sex discrimina-
tion. There is no reason a 5'4"
man can’t protect himself as well
as a‘ 5’4” women.”

Gwinn ended the discussion
with a note on the reluctance of
women to file complaints. “We
usually don’t call a women and

tell her that she’s been discrim-
inated against, but we did recent-
ly regarding a maternity leave at
a Pennsylvania school.

-“The women's fellow teachers
called us, gave us some informa-
tion. and asked if she was being
discriminated against. We found
tthe complaint to be valid and we
called and told her. She didn't be-
lieve us, saying the matter was
school policy, and she refused to
file a complaint." ’

Installs The

What is the biggest hassle you
have had to face as a Pitt student‘?
Registration? Parking? Szabo
"cuisine"? Right up there with
those disasters has to rank the

University Book Store. Not only .

do the textbook prices seem in-
flated, but for the first week or so
of every term there are seemingly
interminable waits in serpentine
check-out lines. '

In ‘an attempt to reduce this
waiting time, the Book Store man-

. __agement has installed an almost

futuristic cash register sy-stem.
the NCR-280. Its operators pass a
small wand over magnetically
coded price tags placed on the
store items. The price is electron-
ically registered and subtotaled.

could be done with eye and hand on

ly thwarts people who have
switched price tags.

The system’s effect on the
check-out lines has been debat-
able, however. Students have ex-
pressed displeasure with the
length of time required to correct
mistakes on the new devices, and
in general seem to think that the
system has done little to expedite
matters. '

According to Bookstore Man-
ager Mary Bonach. however. the
NCR-280 is a tremendous help.

Her figures show that the equip- _

ment has increased check-out
speed from about 30 to over 50

I customers per hour per register.

In addition, she says that "in
years past we‘ve had lines that
reached the back wall of the store.
This term that never happened."

Bonach attributes the long waits
mostly to’ people who wait until
the last minute to fill out their
checks. “even going so far as to

easier to clear on the new ma-

Graduate Student GSPIA '

. "S Cl noted that all the candidates for SGB President

seem concerned about the high cost of textbooks. Their
fcfoncept seems to be that the Bookstore is. in some way
3 or another. primarily to blame. While I understand and
'_7’fully agree with the argument that students should own
=-or control the store (though my experience tells m_e
"that most students will still hate the store no matter

 or even a major part of the high prices indicates a lack
___'of' research on the matter by the candidates: with all
’ '1‘ of the real ripoffs occurring at the University. it doesn‘t
-5:. help anybody to waste energies on a red herring.
‘- Before coming to Pitt. I was a student government
_ president of UCLA. which has the largest student
 owned store in the United States. I chaired the book-
 store committee and the Associated Students Board
_..which oversaw all student-owned services. Before that.
,1, .I'had managed bookstores. both college and private.
" for fiveyears. In Pittsburgh. I managed the book de-
partment "at the old Oakland Co—op. Having established
_ .(I hope) some credibility in the book business. let me
.« try to brief'l-y explain why blaming the bookstore is bull-
: shit. - I ,_
 Textbooks, in the technical language of bookstore
if-.people, are any books which cost the store 20% off the
publisher’s set list price. To you, the student, a text is
,1:-[any book you have to buy. In most cases, the vast maj-
ority of books ordered by professors in a given term
“fall within the 20% classification (or worse): in the tech-
.- nicaltand medical fields, books may, cost the store 15%,
..  ' 10% orI5% off list price. Moreover, the store must pay all

Wfreight‘andehandling charges, which can add up to
A, quite a sum. If the books are not -allsold, the store
";._'can return them; however, they must again pay, post-
'7"a'ge,‘and cannot return even slightly damaged copies.
ffFurther, in the last two years, many publishers have
"’- begun to refuse to accept returns or to limit the amount
'fo_f.returns a- store can make. Some publishers allow a
 25% discount but refuse to, accept all returns. So, for ex-
pi, ample,‘ if Professor Bumtrip tells the store that’ he
' needs 100 copies of INTRODUCTION TO NO/THING
at"$1l.95, and then changes his mind the first week of
 school, and the book is from a “no returns” publisher,
. the bookstore can be stuck with well over a grand in
total losses. -Theft, of course, is also a total loss.

 
  
  
 
   
   
 
   

  
 
   
  

 

   
  
   
  
   

 tracted. To my knowledge. in fact. NO STORE IN THE
''‘,’UNITED STATES MAKES ANY PROFIT ON TEXT-
_fj BOOKS! The‘ Bookstore must continually borrow money
‘.-from banks in order to finance its textbook buying
partly because of the low return and partly because
the payment for books sold comes inafter the date that
._7-bills are due. This is very common in the United States
i and rather expensive to the store as well. When the
 Oakland Co-op tried carrying texts at 10',;. discount. we
lost almo'st,$2.000 with just a few titles. partly because
of lack of student support . . . . . but mostly because we

  Publishers, Faculty Responsible for High Book Prices

make up to 100'} profit (in many cases.) Books are a
rare exception to this rule: automobiles are another.
Most paperbacks you buy as texts. however. are 20’: dis-
count "text paperbacks.“ The store does make more
money on these higher markup books. but there are
several major catches. First. the publisher tends to re-
duce discounts if the book sells too well as a textbook.
Second. the books involved are generally so low cost
that little is gained. You gotta sell an awful lot of Fol-
ger Shakespeare at 600 a crack to make any money!
Third. what money the store does gain merely helps to
cover losses on textbooks.

Used books are helpful: the discounts are good, of-
ten abouti50%, and students like them, yet, in the last
three years, most of the major sources for used books
have dried up, gone bankrupt or gone out of the used
book business. The basic reason‘? Too many textbook
titles. It is very difficult for wholesalers to keep in
touch with the market and to stock all of the titles that
may be needed by a client bookstore. For every title

' that can be resold one can be stuck with hundreds that

are worth only scrap paper prices, and that adds up to
a lot of profit loss. Many stores exchange information
as to wanted titles among themselves, but it is very
time consuming and costs a considerable amount of

- employee time: I know, ‘cause I used to do it myself:

you can spend hours just to get a few copies of a title
and to trade off a few you’re stuck with.

The store makes its money. then. not on textbooks
but on sundries and. to a lesser -extent. on general
books other than technical titles (which also have a
very low discount. as a rule.) Since Faculty tend to buy
most of their books direct from the publisher. who gives
them a discount or even free copies. most of the sales
on general books are to students. The non-technical gen-
eral books do sell. generally. to the Bookstore. for 40’;
discount or better. and the paper and art supplies have
even more generous discounts. Even so. the profits are
not immense. Most private stores need at least 10'; net
profit to make it . . . and the bookstore business has an
incredibly high failure -rate and is a rather low profit
business at best. The Pitt store makes. as I recall. more
around 1-2% profit. The University. not the store itself.
requires all auxiliary services. including the store and
food services. to pay for themselves. charging a rather
large overhead fee against their receipts. and forces a
small profit to be generated-. ~ '

The/University may be a villain in this sense.
thoughmost Universities do no differently but the real
villians are the publishers and the faculty. There are
too many textbook publishers and too many textbook
titles. The college boom of .—the sixties. combined with
the "publish or perish" doctrine caused. the publishers
to proliferate in order to grabjthe large market. while

’ professors cheerfully -obliged by writing thousandsof.

duplicating books. especially “readers". in order to
advance, on the tenure ladder. With such an overload

to make it difficult to use an old edition to keep up
with assignments. The student cannot resell his old edi- .7
tion. which is now wholly worthless. and the store cant ‘
return its back stock.

The faculty and publishers can also add other in-
conveniences to the student. Incompetent warehousing
and shipping procedures cause it to be the publisher’s
fault when books are late coming in, much more than
the store’s. Faculty have a bad habit of late or last
minute cancellations or changes. With a month lead
time often when the number ordered matches the num-
ber enrolled. And, of course, the store goofs up just
like everybody else! i

In the last few years. most college stores have stop-
ped giving discounts to anyone. Even the sacred facul-
ty and staff charge accounts (which Pitt still has. at I
perhaps too high a cost‘) were dropped. The CMU store '
is still giving a discount. but covers the lossthrough
selling gobs of sundries that Pitt doesn‘t sell. and charg-

'ing- for them. at least the last time I checked. consid-

of choice, most textbooks fail to sell in quanity. 3

Therefore. in order to cover losses and make profit.
the cost of books is set much‘ higher than is necessary
and the discount to the store is kept low. Paperback
texts are especially convenient for the publisher. who
can charge very high prices while costs are lower
than on hardcovers. Professors. using the "buddy" sys-
tem. order their friends‘ titles and in return. their own
titles are ordered. We have several gross examples of
this at Pitt. Every school which haslpublishing faculty
on its staff tends to use texts written by colleagues.
Consequently. the used book business became impossi-
ble. Another publisher-faculty trick is to slightly rear-
range textbooks and bring out “new“ editions. The fac-

ulty then insists that students buy the new edition,

which is page numbered with just_ enough difference

erably higher than necessary. in order to-cover‘ the loss.
Their overhead is also smaller. UCLA is considering
bringing back a 5'}. merchandise refund (you keep your
sales slips and get back 5% of the cash you've spent
in merchandise certificates) and can only do that be-
cause they sell tons of sundries. including complete
clothing departments and so forth. If the Pitt store sold
tons of non-book items. it might. given a favorable Uni-
versity policy. be possible to give a similiar small dis-
count. but it would require a much larger store area
to do it. Otherwise. the University could allowltlie,-J.-,,‘,’

"store to operate at a small orilarge loss. but undoubted-" ‘P

ly would simply make up the los's in sometother man- «.4
ner which came out of the pockets of the student. -.

-What can a student do about high prices? (1). Ar:

Pgue. cajole and whatever else. the faculty into setting

certain policies. ‘such as maximising the use of old edi-
tions. changing texts less often. discouraging the writ-
ing of new texts and readers. cutting down on required
texts. using more cheap paperbacks and reprints when-\
ever possible. and so forth. (2) With the faculty. stud-
ents should boycott certain publishers who raise prices
and change editions most frequently. A little research
could easily establish the trends, If other schools and
the campus stores can join in the boycott. it might be
quite effective. (3) If a student lobby can get off the.
ground (I helped found one in California and they are
awfully useful) then it may be possible to obtain a legis-
lative injunction prohibiting certain publisher practic§:é‘~‘,,,
es. (4) Student control might help. and in any event. so'"‘
important an educational resource should be owned
by the campus community rather than by the business
end of the University. which is notoriously unrespon-
sive to non-fiscal issues! However. this is no panacea.
because in order to lower prices in any meaningful
way. you‘d have to sustain a loss. and somebody is go-
ing to have to pay for that loss: otherwise your store
goes into bankruptcy. Moreover. when students com-
plain. the anger will be against student government

.-*4

i rather than the University; yet SGB may be powerless

to do much about it. There is now. at least in theory. a
bookstore advisory committee‘ to insure some input. Yet
it is very faceless and enigmatic to most people on
campus. Student Government should obtain control of
the student membership of that body and highly’ pub-
licise its meetings and findings as an initial step to get-
ting to an understanding and a—~control of operations.
Hope this information helps everyone to understand
the-real problems. ’ '

I‘ THE Tsxicymsksz///Ar ,'

By GEORGE ZRUST

For some students. school be-'
comes boring even before each
new term has begun. It appears.
' . however. that t'or the average Pitt

I student. this boredom takes hold

a couple weeks into the term.
 when assignments and tests flow
free and easy. and the professor
 has told all three of his favorite
_ ‘stories twice over. It's usually

 A. absurd. considering that thumb-

time doesn’t require binoculars
or handy‘ pocket guides to the

ing Audubon-type spirit prevails,
since you are so much on your
own in observing the habits of
each particular, peculiar kind of
student. Space limitations keep
me from telling about the many
types of classmates I have stud-
ied, so I will limit my discussion
to a real favorite of mine, the
easy-to-find Garrulous Enthusius.

Enthusius has no special sexual.
racial. or age characteristics.
and is likely to be found in _‘most
classes. The thing that makes
Enthusius outstanding. though. is
its intense interest in school and
its ready willingness to talk‘ and
answer questions. Because of
these amazing qualities. the spec-
ies is quickly spotted by its nod-
ding head. smiling face. and
alert eyes. In addition. it is giv-
en to outbursts in class. trying
with unbelievable energy to ans-
wer every question that the in-
structor asks. whether it is diffi-
cult ors,» "

times Enthusius shoots its hand
into the air to get its turn at a
question. but often it just opens
fire and cuts off anybody who
happens to be speaking at the
time. If Enthusius is somehow
beaten to answering the ques-
tion by another student. a notice-
ably pathetic look of depression
and disappointment shows in its
expression.

This seldom occurs.’ though. and
usually Enthusius gleefully blurts
out some kind of answer. even if
it is ridiculously far off. Oddly
enough. this species must realize
its own tendency to incorrect
responses. for it often precedes
them with phrases like “It‘s pro-
bably wrong, but . .  or “I don't
know if it's right. but. . 

Garrulous Enthusius is also an ‘

avid note-taker. Its pens and pen-
cils wear out quickly, and its
notebooks fill up fast. The mus-

‘cles in its writing hand are well

developed and limber, and can
flip notebook pages with an ath-

The most fascinating thing
about the Enthusius is its contin-
ued complaining about school-
work and tests. Usually quite in-

the homework is "way too hard“.
even though he or she rapidly
polishes off mostassignments with
ease. Enthusius is in constant fear
of getting poor marks on tests.

Kent State University, already

breakthrough. It is an interde-

joint ‘sponsorship of the’ Depart- A

ments of Political Science, Sociol-
ogy, Comparative Religions, Bio-
logy, and Home Economics. In-

The general heading for this pro-
gram is “Vegetarian’Studies.”

everyone has Black Studies.

us to adopt this latest‘self-fulfill-

grams have performed their func-

Eureka!

Right in sightwas a possible
solution to the dilemma: How can
Pitt develop an innovative pro-
gram?

Workmen were toiling in a deep,
long, and broad pit, acquired at
great expense by the University.
First the building which former-
ly occupied the pit had_ to be pur-
chased and vacated; then it had

to be torn down. It was sturdy,_

being only a few years old, and did
not collapse graciously. Instead,

it had to/be ripped apart.

The University proposes to fill
the pit!’ it constructed at such
great human and fiscal cost with
yet another new building.

Surely the fate of the former

building is omen enough that‘ any
successor will be prey t_o the same
fate. ‘

Instead, a new department could

could be instituted; a whole new.

discipline, complete with profes-
sors, majors, graduate students,

fellowships,_ assistanceships, en-_ 

dowed chairs, scholarships, in-
stant tenure, and at non-structured
curriculum experience.

It would be new, and it would be
nowhere but here._

That has a ring to it. ‘

Just fill the pit with water.
There may be other pits on cam-

' pus—fill them too.

partment could be first, with a
two-pronged attack. One group
could select and breed adequate
supplies of representative species

the local rivers and ponds." An-
other could concoct the proper
mixture of algae, plankton, shit,
and industrial wastes to support
life in the selected population.»

Meanwhile the engineers could

1 graphics, and _predict mean tem-

peratures at various levels. .

The Buffy Saga

SAIGON (AP)—War or peace, build-_up or draw-down herds of but? .

America. -

Several thousand buffies a day migrated when U.S. troops in Viety

24,000, more than 1,000 a week still make the journey.

A buffy, rhymes with stuffy, is an enormous, ornate glazed ce-hf",

ramic elephant. Depending on one’s esthetic sensitivity, it represents
either the highest camp or the lowest kitsch in Vietnames folk art. "

The name derives from the acronym b-u-f-e, for bloody useless ,

Diverse Discs Plocote Rock Enthusiasts

by BARBARA GERAUDV
Rock Columnist

Uriah Heep has come out with

. their -second album in six months.

a continuation "of the "magic"
theme of Demons and Wizards,
entitled The Magician’s Birthday
IMercury SRM 1-652). and it is.
I think. a muchbetter album.
I loved D&W,- but compared to
this new one. it just sounds in-
complete. -

Can't quite put my finger on
what it is that's so great about
this album, other than it’s one for

. all moods—it has a _little bit of

everything in it,_ from the open-
ing love song, “Sunrise,” to the
ten-minute-long title track telling
of how their favorite magician
celebrated his birthday.

.In between are some more
songs in.the mystic mood. all
exquisitely crafted and put to-

   

 

gether. each conveying itsiown
particular sentiment. If you‘re a
Heep fan. you’\‘e probably got
this already. but if you don‘t
have it you should.

And from the mysticism of ['1'-
iah Heep. we go to the down—to-
earth practicality and complex
simplicity of ‘Carly Simon's lat-
est venture. No Secrets tElektra
75049». Ms. Simon (lately mar-
ried to James Taylor. in’ case
you didn't know» has the current
top single in the country. "You're
So Vain." with speculation on
who it's about ranging from Mick
Jagger to Kris Kristofferson. Car-
ly isn't saying.’

Carly has

a ‘beautiful way

with words. I’m not particularly .

fond of female vocalists (except
for Joni Mitchell), so I don’t have

“Legend in Your Own Time”

Artist Reconciles Post
and Present in Showing

By DEAN SIEGAL
Who or what is Watfa Midani‘? She  an artist whose work is

now on display at the Museum of Art.

February 25.
‘Crowded in the tiny

Carnegie Institute through

"Gallery K" of the museums‘ third floor

are nine of her acrylic paintings. Each one of ‘her workslare bold.
bright.. colorful and large in size and are displayed in a visually
opposing manner. The viewer is shocked by what he_sees instead of
being attracted by something he may like.

Through the use of colour and shape, Midani makes animate sub-
jects inanimate. She displays several human actions through the use
of pattern, repitition or gradiations of the same" color. Her compo-
sitions are often very geometric and well balanced.

Her paintings are appropriately titled——th'ey do just what the

title_implies. One of her works. "Procession". shows various poses of '

a man and his horse and seems to almost tell a story. Others employ
repitition and overlapping of forms to.sh0w. "Sinbad and the Rokh”
"Jonah and the Whale" and "Lovers“. _ T - ‘-
Watfa Midani's works are_ obviously influenced by the art of the
Middle East. Her name implies her Lebanese background. and Mid-
dle Eastern cultural influences. '

Of her paintings she says, “My work is a perpetual act of re-
conciliation. I must reconcile the past to the present . .  I must
bring the motifs, shapes, colors and feelings of theipast, my past,
to the dynamism of the ever changing modern times . . . .‘ I lookito
Egyptian art, with its multi-layers of many civilizations’to find my-
self as an artist. For my self-realization as a human being, I look to

19

the'whole world. . . . . A ,

She has‘-indeed been sincere in her effort to reconcile the past
to the ever changing-present. and has used Egyptian art as her in-

fluence. Midani has achieved her purpose in that respect. In judging

theiinherent quality: of her work one must offer a suitable response
to the question. of whether or not art is ready to accept Watfa Mi-
dani.

\

 and “That’s the Way I Always ‘

Heard It Should Be” impressed
me, both in the writing and per-
formance.

And this new one is more of the
same. From‘ the opening “The

Right Thing to Do" through
"You're So Vain“ to "It Was
So Easy." she says things that

all of us have felt at one time or
another. but couldn't put into
words the way she does.

She, does more solo writing in
this one. too—~only two songs are
with Jacob Brackman—six are by
herself. one by James Taylor and
one by Carly and Billy Merritt.
But they are all Carly's—and
she puts her heart into them. so
you know she feels. This is one

i you should have.

The scene in the Pitt locker room following the skaters
come from behind, victory over Duquesne on January 13-was
indeed a jubilant one. except for a few words that were ex-
changed between Denny Browne, Pitt first line winger. and
apair of reporters from the Duquesne‘Duke.. 4 '

It seems that those reporters had questioned Browne about
the fight in which he and Duke player“-coach C. H. Bender

  

iIIlllIlllllllllllllllllIIIIllllllllllllllIlllIllllllllllllllllllllllé

A were involved. With all due respect to those reporters, those

questions, turned out to be a diplomatic effort to accuse
Browne ofinjuring Bender in thatfight. . _

First of all, let’s clear’up what actually.happened at 8:14
of the first period. The puck was loose. in front of the Duq-
uesne net and Bender went down on the ice in order to cover.

up on the puck and stop play. Bender, however. was not suc— .

cessful in his attempt and Browne, seeing the loose puck.
tried to dig it out from the side of Bender’s legs. At that time
the whistle had not been blown for a faceoff.

Bender retaliated to Browne’s vigorous attempts by slash-
ing him across the body, a slash that barely missed Browne’s
head. With Benderon his knees, Browne admittedly put his

knee into Bender’s face. But Browne also claims that Bend— 

er’s face was so_ close that he did not lift his skate from the
ice when he kneed Bender.

A fight then followed. along-with a pileup of four other
players immediately surrounding Bender and Browne. In

short. Browne won the .fight. Browne received five minutes‘

for fighting and five for kneeing while Bender was assessed
only five minutes for fighting. ‘

Bender. on his first shift after serving his time. did ‘have
a bandage over his eye but continued to-play. In fact. Bender

played the whole second period and a few minutes of the V

third. Shortly into the third period. Bender was struck on the
face by. ahard shot and immediately skated off the ice. leav-
ing his stick and gloves. . . ‘ ‘

After the game, Browne was informed by the Duke re-
porters that Bender’s nose was-broken and that it might have
been a result of the kneeing incident. Browne openly admitted
that he kneed Bender after Bender had slashed him. Browne
sarcastically laughed at the accusation that he broke Bender’s
nose, saying, “Yeah, Iput my knee into him and broke his
nose and cut his eye.” I

Bender claims -that Browne kicked him in the face-when
Bender was on the ice and that another skater inflicted furth-
er injury by jumping on his back while he was half conscious.
flat on the ice. Bender's side of the story is. however. in
complete conflict with the referee. who was directly on top
of the play. /.

After that incident. Bender returned to the’ lineup and
played the entire second period. He claims that his nose was
broken. .If it was. my compliments to Bender for playing so
valiantly under such pain. However. it is the opinion of this
reporter that the shot that struck Bender in the face in the
third period did the damage.

According to «the ‘Jan. 18- edition of the Duquesne Duke,
Bender has adopted a new attitude. one of retaliation. ‘But
remember. Browne only returned _a cheap shot for’ a cheap

Knight Not Leader Type  

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

Success follows the Panthers‘ basketball star
Billy "Mooney" Knight around like a shadow but
he's definitly not a leader——or so he says.

"The coaches say that I should try to tell the
guys what to do." related the 6-6‘: junior. "I try to
but still I'm not the leader type. It's just not in my
personality to get out there and yell."

No matter what type Knight happens to be. it‘s a

just theright one for the young Panther squad.
Anyone who -can average 22.8 points and 10.2
rebounds per game as Knight is doing is certain to
be a welcome member-on any team.
’ In the each of the five games prior to the Pan-
thers" last contestwhich was against St. Francis.
Knight scored well above 20 points:

Despite his outstanding personal performance

I to date. Knight had a rather slow start this season.

“The other squads were double teaming and
trapping me in the beginning,” stated the All-Amer-
ican candidate. “I got really depressed in the early
games. But now I think I have my confidence back.

They are not double teaming me as much as before j

and I think it’s going to be good the rest of the way.”

Although Mooney is leading his fellow team-
mates in the statistical column and is quickly ap-
proaching the list of all-time Pitt leading scorers.
he has established no personal goals that he would
liketo attain by the end of the season.

"I haven't set any personal goals for myself‘

this year." said the hoop star. "Earlier in the sea-
son I hoped that the team would go to a tournament
but now I just want usto have a successful season.“

Whether’ the Panther cagers have a successful
’72-73 campaign. will depend greatly on their abil-

ity to overcome the inexperience onthe court. The"

squad has been hot and cold in its showings so far
this season and according to Knight the contributing
factors are the team’s abundance ofyoung players
who have had very little playing experience.

"Our team hasn't been very consistent. mostly

because of the youth and inexperience of the play- ,
‘ ers." explained Mooney. "Next year I think all of

that part of the mistakes will be gone. Even in the
later part of this season they should be all gone."

The effect of having so many young players on
the team shows up mostly in the tight contests.

“In the close games they (the young hoopstersi

aren't sure about whether they‘re doing the right‘

thing.“ continued Knight. "Even the veterans don‘t
always know exactly what to do. But I really think
that everyone will overcome this."

Although these players are young. Pitt's head
basketball coach thinks that they have a great deal

of talent. These players. in combination with the ~

outstanding veterans on the team. make for an ex-
cess of talent on the team. ‘

To overcome this situation, Ridl does a lot of
substituting of players during the different games.
Knight does not feel that this subbing by the.coach-
es harms the team to any great extent.

"It doesn‘t hurt to the extent that it matters
that much." stated the hoop star. “You just have to
get used to playing with all the guys. We haven't
played together enough to know what to do. though.
The only person I really know how to play well with
is Carl Morris and that’s only because we played to-
gether in high school.

Bill Knight may not see himself as leadership
material (an honor he confers on freshman Keith
Starr because of his confidence and aggressiveness)
but he is nevertheless an indispensable element
that helps to make up Pitt basketball. '

BILL “MOONEY” KNIGHT, Pitt’s All-Ameriican can-

didate, doesn’t feel he has the capacity to be a leader ,

but his superb, shooting and rebounding make him‘
more than an'i'ndispensab|e element of the team.

  Matmen Host Mounties,
. Tonight In Crucial Meet

by BILL PROUDFOOT

, Nobody is mentioning West Virginials wrest-
ling’ "team in the same breath with Lehigh, . or Navy.
or Michigan. But just the same. the Mounties are
bringing a winning record and a few tough individ-
uals up from Morgantown to meet the Cats at 8 p.m.
this Wednesday night at the Field House.

Although the Mountaineer wins have come over
teams like St, Vincent's. Frostburg State. and Tow-
son State. none of whom are to be
mistaken for national powers.
the Cats can‘t afford to let down

after Saturday's dismal loss to
Lehigh.

A win by the Mounties would
set the Panthers back to 2-5 with
tough dual meets with Clarion
State and Penn State still remain-
ing.

_Pitt Coach Dave Adams is hoping for a big stu-
dent turnout to root for his club. The Mountaineers
are sure to hit town equipped with some of their
fanantical “Let's-Beat-Pitt” fans, and Adams feels
his team would be boosted by a good number of
cheering Panther lovers.

 

ADAMS

The Mounties are 5-3 so far this season. and
have lost to a couple of tough schools. They were
beaten by Waynesburg and by Delaware. a team
that has already pinned a loss on the Panthers.-
West Virginia's only other loss was to Duquesne.

The Mountaineers sport three starters with a
combined record of 20-3. In the 126 pound class.
Craig Hillegass is 7-1. as is 150 pound Garret
Brakeiron. In the 118 pound category Jeff Brown
has been beaten only once in seven starts.

An interesting match shapes up at 150, where
Brakeiron goes against once beaten John Buzzato.

Buzzato, who lost in his first match at Michigan,

West Virginia has a slight injury problem as

both of their co-captains are on the shelf for the '

season. due to injuries. In the 190 pound class Bob
Vettorel has a bad back. and the Panthers may
have caught a break in that once-beaten 142 pound
Blair Albert is out with a bum knee. ’

Coach Adams is indefinite as to the Cat’s own in-
jury situation. but “will wrestle the best we can. no
matter‘ who we‘re in with." He did say. though.
that Ray Dallatore would be in the lineup some-
where,

For _the remainder of the 1972-
73 basketball season., Lucius
Keese will sleep a little better in
his Tower A dormitory room des-"
pite the fact that his mammoth
feet will still hang out of his bed.
Keese got his first start as the
center of the Pitt basketball team
last Saturday night against the
Frankies of St. Francis College
and is, like his numerous boister-
ous fans. tickled about the fact.

The day after now. wearing
nothing but blue gym trunks and
having teammate Kirk Bruce as a .
guest. Lucius was buy figuring out
which “dude" was “badder than"
which other."dude" in the Nation-
al Football Leagues Pro Bowl.
brought to him by television.

In between the commercials
and time outs. the Largo (Flori-
da) Junior College transfer found
time to comment about the past.
the present, and the future of an-
other dude—a bid dude. himself.

In his first start; Keese played
more than 25 minutes, scored a
modest six points, scooped up sev-
en rebounds, blocked one shot,
and set some wide screens; both
offensively — particularly for
guard Tom Richards—and on de-
fense.

Really. Keese didn't" set the
Field House on t'ire. However. he
did do what he believed he could.
what his fans hoped he would.
and what his coach was trying to
find out if he could. That-is. an
adequate job.‘ . .-

“Good." the 20 year old junior
said. in answer as to how he felt
about his showing the night be-.
fore. “When I found out I was

starting on Friday I was shocked.
But I settled down. —

“It was a little sloppy but it was
a good game. There are a few
spots I have to shape up on, like
ball handling and rebounding, but
I was reall happy that we won the
game.”

One would think that Lucius
was beginning to wonder if he
would ever get a starting assign-.
ment and it his destiny lurked on
the bench. "but he said he wasn’t
worried.

"I haven't worried about when‘
he lRldl) was going to start me
because it doesn't do any good to
worry. I knew he would sooner or
later and I just waited my turn."

In view of the fact that the Cats
have had some rebounding trouble
this year and that the lack of the
big man was cited as the main
reason for failure to win an addi-
tional five games last year, every-
one figured Lucius’ presence was
the answer.

Well, Keese is big alright
6’10". 233 pounds—but his hands.
which measure 103,4 inches long
and 81/2 inches wide sometimes
fail to grab a basketball when it
should and his size 17 feet have a
tough time lugging all that pound-
age up and down the court. Also.
he has some problems reacting to
the quicker moves of smaller op-
position.

But by no means is he a lost
cause. With some hard work by
assistant coach Tim Grgurich and
and some fan encouragement.
Lucius -finds himself wanting to
do it. ‘

“I don’t know why the fans
cheer for me like they do, but it
makes me feel good. Maybe it’s

    Keese Respectable In

because of my personality?”

' With his joke. Luscious found it
necessary to cover the grin that
was rapidly spreading across his
large face. And after Bruce clear-
ed his throat. Keese got a little
more serious.

"The fans weant to make me

go and last night I did."

It's doubtful Buzz Ridl will
abandon his other centers (Jim
Bolla. Carl Morris. and Bill Sul-
kowskii as a result of Keeses per-
formance in future games. but
Ridl might be less reluctant to
call on him again.

it is an evening of surpris-
ing and succinct happiness.
The s are not exactly
manorab . but not exactly
forgettable either. They
linger in the mind. The
themes are universal, but not
so universal that they are
ridiculous. Six people ar-
range to sing their hearts
out, and do so with the most
elegant finesse.

The music by Mr. Goggin
and Mr. Soley has an easy an
to it. lt_is the kind of music
that massages your musical
impulses. the’ kind of music
that ‘confirms your expecta-
tions. The lyrics exult in such
vague things as funerals and
vasectomy. in social dances
and sexual rattems. This is
the type of ight-hearted mu-
sical that a sensitive man
could identify wit.h, accept
and even admire. With all its
pulses and frenzies, this is a
very’-cloday show.

The setting, by Chenault
Spence. is here and beautiful.
and the direction and cb<>
reography by Darwin Knight
are forceful and effervescent.
This continuing narrative of
youthful alienation has a spe-
cial cheerfulness that Mr.
Knight has picked up. The
show moves very easily on
its way to amusement.

this indeed has a battered ef-
fectiveness that makes the
very most of'lts familiarity.
‘me lyrics are both arch and
triumphant. words lost in the
mystery of sensibility. l was
most impressed by the lib-
erated madness of Mr. Lo-
rick's poetry. Here was a
man who would be sumptu-
ously at home with Lewis
Carroll and his Mad Hatter.

The cast was excellent,
totally responsive to this
strange yet very lovely show.
Jack Blackton. ‘a graduate of
"Jacques Bret." was exem-
plary, but then so was
everyone else. The ‘rls,
Sharron Miller and Eaine
Petricoff. were all sweetness
and spice, and Danny Guer-
rero. together with the com-
posers. Mr. Goggin and Mr.
Solley. completed a cast of
responsiveness and charm.

I really enjoyed “Harkl" It
was .unpretent.ious and yet
meaningful, witty and yet
lyrical, committed and yet
blithe. it struck me as a
happy excursion in the thea-

He acknowledges the other play-
