After telling about a

shootout he had recently seen
in his apartment building, the
10-year-old boy from Arlington
Heights insisted that he was
not afraid until Pitt student and
fraternity member Duane

"A "5. Pettus broke in.

‘‘I’d be scared of them,”
Pettus said firmly. “Anybody

n‘ points a gun at me, I’d have _a
little bit of fear.”

_ Although this did not com-
pletely convince the young

-kvgaoy, he and his 16 friends sat

up and attentively listened to
the older man’s words.

That was exactly why
Arlington Heights YMCA
Program Director Regis Sharif
had brought the boys to Pitt —

to expose them to positive role

models. Sharif has brought the

.-kids to Pitt five times this
semester to meet with mem-
- bers of black fraternities.

“This program was designed
to give these kids a compari-
son between gang behavior

igfftnd fraternity behavior,” said

Sharif. “We wanted to-show

The holidays are nearing and times are
tough for some people, but there are some
Pitt students who are trying to help. '

Pitt’s Black Law Students Association is
sponsoring a Thanksgiving food drive,
East
Cooperative Ministry Inc., located in East
Liberty, and the affiliated Zapporro

which will benefit the

Women’s Shelter.

Students are encouraged to donate all
. kinds of cannedand boxed goods. The
 Black Law Students Association is also pur-
" 5" chasing turkeys and trimmings for area
Pittsburgh residents. The association raised
money for this through a sweatshirt sale.
Association President Deborah Robinson
a said that students havealready donated
“boxes and boxes” of goods. “Right now,
there are five big cartons of food in front

of me,” she said.

Drop-off points are located at each ele-
gvator in the Pitt Law School Building on
V?orbes Avenue _ _

The drive began on Nov. 9 and contribu-
tions will be accepted through Wednesday,

Last Thursday the group dis-

cussed recent black—theme .

movies they had seen during
the previous week. Sharif
asked the Pitt black fraternity
members to compare their col-
lege experiences with House
Party 2, a movie about a rap-
per who goes to college.
Although’ the six Pitt stu-
dents said the movie had little
to do with the reality of col-

lege life, Pettus found one par-1

allel.

“Some people at college will
help you succeed,” he said,
referring to a professor in the"
movie who pushed the main
character to study. “Some peo-
ple will do that.”

“Like you?” one of the boys
asked.

“Yeah,” said Pettus. “I’ll help
you out.”

‘Otherwise, the fraternity
members criticized the movie
for its portrayal of college as a
place of little work and con-
stant opportunities for sex.

The group found many par-
allels between juice, a movie
about a group of inner—city
youths, and their life in
Arlington Heights.

Military ban on gays incites debate

By Kim Pa-lmiero

On the eve of what may
prove to be a year of historic
change for the military, due
to President—elect Bill
Clinton’s proposal to lift the
Department of Defense’s 43-
year ban on gays and lesbians

the DOD’s ban, Clinton’s pro-

equal rights in job opportuni-

the idea of homosexuals in
the military, according to a
CBS/New Yorle Times news
poll.

gays and lesbians is in dis-

Farris, get up and prepare for another eight-
hour“day, and usually a lot of overtime, at
their job.

Their employment is slightly different from the
average job. They are located right on Forbes
Avenue. Their employers —— the people who walk
by them every day. Their only tools are their attire
and the cups that they use to collect money. Their
pay — pennies a day. ~

Eight hours a day, seven days a week they ask
for money, food or any kind of support that can
be offered.

Farris said for the past two months, he and
Maxwell had to take this line of work just to sur-
vive. Maxwell strategically sits outside of the 7-11
on Forbes Avenue while Farris sits near the
Original Hot Dog Shop.

Both try to find work, but employers see them
as risks. Maxwell, who has children to take care
of, holds his head high. Even though many look
down on him, he said he stays positive and choos-
es not to intimidate people into giving him
money.

Neither of them have permanent housing, so
they combine their earnings and try to get
overnight housing. Unlike Maxwell and Farris,
Dwayne Blanchard chooses to work alone. He
works across the street from McDonald’s on
Forbes Avenue. Blanchard usually works about
three to five times a week in Oakland.

Farris said it is hard to find a job. When a

Every day Melvin Maxwell and his partner, T.

prospective employer tries. to get in touch with

him, he has already moved to a new location or
he misses the call because he is out asking for
money. He was fired twice, he said, because of
his housing problem.

“It’s hard not having a guaranteed address. The
employer sees me as a risk,” Blanchard said.

The campus police are normally friendly and
do not bother them, Farris said. But the Pittsburgh
police are not so kind. Farris said that one city
officer told him to “go crawl in a hole somewhere;
I don’t care if you starve.” The city police con-
stantly make them move. Maxwell said one officer
told him to “move now! And if I come back, and
see you still here, I am going to lock you up.’’ .

“Many people look down on us, throw change
at us and laugh. But we don’t let this faze us. We
don’t like the situation we are in, but we stay pos-
itive and keep our faith,” Farris said.

Theta Chi picks up the pieces in Riverview Park

By Matt Groffl
Staff‘ Writer

Theta Chi gave a lift to Pittsburgh’s
Riverview Park by participating in USA
Today Weekend's “Make—A-Difference”
Day on Saturday Nov. 14.

The local projectgof this national
effort was a litter pick—up sponsored
by Friends of Riverview Park, a social
service organization which encourages
community involvement for handi-
capped people.

According to Theta Chi President
Mike Cuchran, about 20 brothers and
pledges took part in the event, which
involved churches, high schools and
community service groups. Pitt’s Space

Management Division also participat-
ed. _

The goal was to improve the look of
the Northside’s Riverview Park, one of
four regional parks in Pittsburgh, by
picking up bottles, paper trash and car
parts that have accumulated in the
park.

“We walked through the park,
picked up the trash and sorted out
whatever could be recycled,” Cuchran
said. “Not only did we get to meet
others from local community organiza-
tions, but it really made us aware of
the problems the park faces.”

Myrna Antonio, coordinator of
Partners in Parks, made the resources
available for this community effort and

hopes that more people realize how
the parks are affected by recent city
cutbacks.

“Budget deficits require major
spending cuts in community programs
such as park service,” Antonio said.
“City workers try to pick up whatever
is near the roads, but most of the trash
would not get picked up if it wasn’t
for volunteers.”

Antonio noted that the volunteer
effort was approved by the city bar-
gaining unit.

Theta Chi was an important part of
“Make-A-Difference” Day, said Paul
Ungerman, organizer of the event and

president of Friends of Riverview *

Park.

“Our organization is unique because
it encourages disabled people to take
leadership roles in service projects
like this,” Ungerman said. “It’s impor-
tant that we are supported by other
groups and that Theta Chi had an
exceptional turnout.”

Ungerman said that by holding the
litter pick-up in conjunction with
“Make-A-Difference” Day, Friends of
Riverview Park hopeto gain financial
support from the national sponsor,
USA Today Weekend.

“Right now most of the budget for
our projects comes out of our pock-
ets,” Ungerman said. “I think this is a
cause that could be more effective if
we received monetary aid.”

P/ootojozm/zozZz'5t Serotta depictsjewisb life through Zens

By Michael Srulevich
For T be Pitt News

“There are no ‘last Jews’ in
Eastern and Central Europe,”
photojournalist Edward Serotta
said as he presented his exhib-
it “Out of the Shadows: A por-
trait of Jewish Life in Central
Europe Since the Holocaust.”

Thursday night at the Frick
Fine Arts Building, Serotta
explained that he originally
went to Central Europe to do a
documentary on the “The Last
Jews Of Eastern Europe.” He
said he quickly became aware
that his assumption, “last
Jews,” was incorrect.

The Jews in Central Europe
do not like being called the
“last Jews.” Serotta said, if
Jews live there today and are

trying to re—establish their
communities, then they are not
the “last Jews” but deserve to
be there.

Serotta said that although
most of the communities
remain small, numbers do not
count.. What counts is that
these small communities are
“thriving,” and their Jewish
identity is resurging, he said.

The exhibit is a part of the
culmination of five years of
work in which Serotta lived
and worked in Central Europe
from the mid-to—late ‘80s. The
exhibit portrays various
aspects of Jewish life in
Central Europe, but its most
captivating feature is the focus
on people.

There is, for example, a
photo of Henrietta Schrager,

Dresden’s oldest Jew at 90,
who frequently visits the old
Jewish cemeteries. There is
also one of Petyus in a nursing
home in Budapest who some-
how survived the Holocaust
and -is now a double amputee.

There are pictures of little
children celebrating Purim and
singing Hanukkah songs and
of youth who are gathered in
the Jewish Community Center
informer Yugoslavia to play
guitar and sing. -

“It’s really important that
people see there still is a
Jewish community in Eastern
and Central Europe,” Pitt
senior Eric Davis said. “The
Holocaust really didn’t wipe
out those communities.”

Davis also commented on
the contrast between the old

delemmas.

and after 1975.

particularly representative
photo, and my favorite one,
was the one with a little girl
and her grandfather on a
bench. The little girl, on one
side, was drinking a Pepsi and
smiling into the camera. On
the other side of the bench,
her old grandfather was
watching her with a proud
smile on his face.”

In conjunction with the
exhibit, Professor Rusinow
from Pitt’s department of histo-
ry and Center for Russian and
East European Studies will pre-
sent “The Resurgence of
Nationalism Since 1989” on
24. Also, Professor
Orbach of Pitt’s religious stud-
ies department, will speak
about “Jewish Communities of

Eastern. Europe. Today” on
Dec. 3.

The event will be on Dec. 6
with speaker Barbara Shore,
from Pitt’s School of Social
Work and a member of the
Holocaust Commission. The
presentations will be given by
individuals who who have ties
with the communities of
Eastern Europe. Information
will also be given on how to
travel or reconnect with roots
in this part of the world.

The exhibit, sponsored by
the Holocaust Center of the
United Jewish Federation and
Pitt, is being displayed at the
University Art Gallery until
Dec. 6. The exhibit is open
Tuesday through Saturday 10
a.m to 4 p.m. and Sunday 2 to

Blue and Gold Society
bridges gap between
alumni and students

By Eric E. Seman
For the Pitt News

One of the University of
Pittsburgh’s newest student orga-
nizations is also one of its most
unique because it deals with the
students of the past rather than
the students of the present.

Modeled after a similar group
at the University of Southern
Alabama, the Blue and Gold
Society’s main mission is to forge
a bond between current Pitt stu-
dents and alumni.

“We don’t consider ourselves
as representatives of today’s Pitt
students,” organization President
Christine Bienkowski said. “We
are more like ambassadors.”

Blue and Gold members are
becoming more of a fixture at
alumni and administration func-
tions as they are being called
upon to assist in the planning
and hosting of several events.

“It’s more than just passing out
name tags,” Bienkowski said.
“We mingle and talk to alumni at
these gatherings and do whatev-
er we can to make them feel at
home while on campus.” _ A

The Blue and Gold Society is
not the easiest of student organi-
zations for students to become
members. Along with a 2.5 or
better GPA, all prospective mem-
bers must have at least three rec-
ommendations from members of
the Pitt faculty, administration or

student body. Only then does
one become interviewed by a 10-
member panel, made up of high-
ranking administration and alum-
ni group officials. Only 19 appli-
cants were accepted this year.

The members of Blue and
Gold are students with wide
ranging majors ——from fine arts
to pre-med. One factor they all,
share, however, is involvement in
other university groups and orga-
nizations.

“For each one of our members,
there are at least three other stu-
dent groups represented,”
Bienkowski said.

Due to the heavy involvement
in the other organizations, the
only time all members have free
to meet is Mondays at seven in
the morning, but the Blue and
Gold Society “is definitely a prior-
ity of all other activities,” she
said. '

There are substantial benefits
to all society members.

“Networking with successful
alumnus will always be helpful
when looking for a job after
graduation, but we also put stu-
dents in contact with those mak-
ing the big decisions here at Pitt,”
she said.

The society also is striving to
make membership in Blue and
Gold a mark of excellence.

“We want membership to
mean a responsible and dedicat- .

Military

DOD policy is not discrimina-
tory because homosexuality is
a chosen type of lifestyle.”

“The military has you sign a
contract, and right now gays
and lesbians are not abiding
by this contract,” College
Republicans President Kevin
Docherty said.

And Clinton has less credi-
bility because he has not
served in the Armed Forces,
Docherty added.

“Before any draft—dodger
starts using the military they
should give serious considera-
tion to any changes he pro-
poses,” he said. “He has the
power and authority of com-
mander in chief, but his title is
apropos.”

But Linda Jarrett, a member
of Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, said she thinks peo-
ple in the military will respect
the decision if Clinton lifts the
ban. “The military is set up in
a way that more people
respect authority.”

“I don’t like to think the
military is made up of such
unruly people that they won’t
respect authority. I think this
argument is just fictitious
because I think they do
respect authority,” Jarrett said.

“And if,” she continued,
“they don’t respect authority,
they should be ousted. Maybe
this is a good way to find out
who doesn’t [respect authori-
tyl.”

“I can’t think of any good
reason to keep gays out,” said
Shawn McClearn, president of
the University Democrats.
“They’re using the same argu-
ments that were used to keep
blacks out of the military. And
there may have been some
problems in the short term,
but it all worked out in the
long term.”

Last February, Chancellor J.
Dennis O'Connor rejected a
recommendation by a univer-
sity senate committee to
remove the ROTC from cam-
pus in 1997 if the DOD did
not change its policy by then.
He said that he would work
jointly with organizations out-
side of the university to
change the policy, but in act-
ing alone it could harm stu-
dents who receive scholar-
ships from ROTC.

O'Connor did not respond
to several attempts to obtain a
comment on Clinton's propos-
al and how it would affect the
university.

Student Government Board
member Ross Pasquale reaf-
firmed the board's statement
from last February, in which it

urged a removal of the ROTC
from Pitt because of the ban.

“The 1992 Student
Government Board still stands
by the statement they made
last year, but we can’t speak
for the new members,” he
said.

“ROTC adheres to and fol-
lows DOD regulations and
does not allow persons of a
homosexual or bisexual orien-
tation to participate within its
programs. This form of dis-
crimination condoned by the
university is deplorable,” part
of the February statement"
said.

“... lT]he policy will
change,” said graduate student
Mark Smith. “This policy is
mean—spirited and will be long
forgotten. In the meantime, it
will cause more campus
unrest and civil disobedience.”

John McKenna, a senior,
disagrees. “I was watching the
news the other day, and they
made a good point. Men and
women can’t sleep together in
the military, can’t bathe
together in the same room. If

homosexuals were allowed in

the military they would be
allowed to be in the same
room.”

He continued, “If they’re
going to do, that they might
as well let men and women
sleep together and change the
whole purpose of the military.
There’s no way you could
stop homosexuals from enter-
ing the military, but the fact of
knowing puts a lot of people
at unrest.”

“I guess if .you’re not
allowed to discriminate
against them in other types of
jobs, they should not be
allowed to discriminate
against them in the military,”
said Pam, a student who only
wished to be identified by her
first name, because, she said
"I know people» in the military
who disagree with Clinton’s

proposal, and I don’t want .

to’ start anything with
them.”

“Just because someone’s
sexual orientation is different,
that does not mean they can’t
fight as well or perform as
well. It has nothing to do with
how well they can perform a
job,” senior Veronica Player
said.

But Player added that she
thinks the policy should be
instituted gradually.

“In the case of the military, I
think more time would allow
them to become more educat-
ed about some of the myths
they have about gays and les-
bians,” she said.

goes crazy,” Sharif said, refer-
ring to a character in the
movie.

“You give Kamu the gun and
he goes crazy,” he added,
referring to an Arlington
Heights teenager. “\X7here’s
Kamu at now?”

“Jail,” the boys said in cho-
rus.

“Now what’s that tell you?”

Sharif asked.

At the end of the discussion,
the BAS members decided that
they would take the boys on a
tour of Hillman Library next
week.

“When we asked the kids
this week who wanted to go
to college they all raised their
hands,” said Sharif. “The first
time we came they didn’t even
know where Pitt was.”

ed student,” Bienkowski said.

The Blue and Gold Society does not exclu-
sively participate in alumni—organized functions.
It is beginning to put together events of its own.
The members played an important role at Pitt
basketball"s “Midnight Madness” as they acted as
ushers and hosts. .

In the future they are planning caroling over

the holidays, and are looking into sponsoring a
senior reception in the spring.

The receptions play into the alumni assisting
goal of the group as they will act as recruiting
vehicles for altunni groups.

“\Y7e see every student at Pitt as future alum-
ni,” Bienkowski said. “College is a special time
for most people, and we like to help them hang
on to a piece of that.”

Pittsburgh politics ain’t-what it used to be, at least
not in the early going for the mayor’s office.

A town known for its childish name—calling in bru-

tal campaigns for city council seems ready to shed its
ruthless image. This is unfortunate because there is
no greater local soap opera than Pittsburgh politics.
_ Last week, mayoral hopefuls and current
Democratic County Commissioners Tom Foerster and
Pete Flaherty pulled off a campaign first — they
endorsed each other.

“I haven’t made a commitment to anyone, but I’ll
do it right now,” Foerster said. “If he decides to run

’ for mayor, I’ll support Pete Flaherty.”

“If Torn Foerster wants to run, I can think of

‘nobody better,” Flaherty said. “Tom Foerster is the

number-one candidate.”
This is the height of political silliness, not to men-

tion boredom. How are the voters supposed tolmake -

a choice for the city’s highest office when the two
frontrunners actually support each other?

In addition, how is the media, whichthrives on

controversy, supposed to have any fun?
Take the recent run for Senate in New York
that pitted Geraldine Ferraro, Frank “You say

DeMato, I’ll say” DeMato, the Rev. Al Sharpton and

Robert Abrams against each other. Now there’s a
campaign! It was hands down the dirtiest campaign
of the 1992 election. L

~ And despite the needless mudslinging that occurred

during this election, the best candidate emerged.
That’s not to say anything of the media blitz that
took place during this election. People were disgust-
ed by this horrible display of self-righteous politick—
ing. ‘ . S‘ s.

Yet despite the fact that people were annoyed and
asked, “When are we going to get down to the
issues?” they stayed attentive. If the candidates mere-
ly debated_the issues, then surely people would be
bored and the election less colorful. Besides, most
issues are so complicated that if they were debated
substantively most people would be walking around
all day with their heads spinning.

People complain, but the way things are now, neg-
ative campaigning is the best we have. Granted, neg-
ative campaigning isn’t the best way to identify a
candidate’s strong points. It distorts the issues and
trivializes our democratic process.

Nevertheless, while voters are forced to sort through

the issues and decide for themselves what is truth‘
-and what isn’t, it brings out a surplus of information.

“Friendly campaigning,” on the other hand, while it
may bring about substantive debate, can serve to
cover up information and hide relevant facts ——
namely because candidates collude, and they may
Work in the best interests of each other instead of
the constituents.

Some extra turkey for Thanksgiving ’

It’s thatltime of year again
when we have to put aside our
own trivial annoyances and
take into consideration all that
we have to be thankful for.
The true meaning of
Thanksgiving is sure to be a
topic of debate andldiscussion

. at thousands of dinner tables

across the this
Thursday.

We hope that herein we pro-
vide you with considerable

fuel for Thanksgiving discus-

country

sion:

«Frank Perdue, Mr. Butterball
and’ special mention to- Tyson.

This seems like a log-
ical place to start,-for these are
the special people who supply
us with turkeys. A special
mention should go to the
last turkey supplier mentioned
because he provided us with
the most important turkey
of all — President-elect Bill
Clinton (for those of you who
don’t—know, Tyson was a major
contributor to the Clinton
campaign). The mark of a
good poultry man is one
who knows when to‘ re-
place an old turkey with a new
one.

-Animal-rights activists.

Thanks to the Tofu-eating,
bean—sprout sucking animal-
rights activists for doing their
damnedest to ruin our tradi-
tional Thanksgiving dinner.
What a great idea to invite the
turkey to sit with you at dinner
instead of eating it.

-Thanks to Saint Primate (the
baboon).

The primate who loved the
world so much that he was
willing to put aside his evolu-
tionary grudge against
humankind. He gave of himself
all he could to save his cousin
— Homosapien. Now that’s
dedication. .
-Thank you, environmentalists.

We thank these special peo-
ple for protecting us from cer-
tain destruction. First the spot-
ted owl and now us — how
considerate. Saving the envi-

economic well-being is bril-
liant.Besides who needs
employment?

And those stories about glob-
al warming, and ozone deple-
tion are great fun. We thank
you for entertaining us so well.
-Thanks to the U.S. Navy.

It’s not that we support
everything that the Navy does,
but we give thanks to it for fir-
ing some shells and trying

Cliris Diersen
and
Frank Porco

to keep those “rainbow war-
riors,” Greenpeace, off of
the high seas. Sometimes we
wonder whose agenda
Greenpeace is trying to further
anyway.

Is it really that concerned
with protecting the environ-
ment, or does it simply want
more press?

Once again the problem isn’t
the environment but those try-
ing to protect it. A world full of
ﬂowers, clean air and spotted
owls would be beautiful; that
is, of course, unless you
don’t mind a bunch of, unem-
ployed bums littering the
streets.

-The maintenance guys at the
Cathedral of Learning.

We’d like to thank these fel-
lows for making sure that the
Cathedral of Learning will
never lose its old rustic charm.
By refusing to oil the hinges
on even one door in the entire
building, they make sure that
an incessant squealing will
always be a welcome feature at
the tallest educational building
in the country.

-Thanks to the “stubborn mas-
turbator” at Hillman Library.

In a world driven by private
interests and big business, we
all too often forget about the
value of a liberal arts educa-
tion. Today, most of.us are
concerned with a “practical

“mmm2Lm&m €ttin9 into
, , .

medical or law school. If it
weren’t for that stubborn mas-
turbator on the fourth ﬂoor of
Hillman Library, most of us
would forget how valuable a
liberal arts education can be;

Any mission which keeps
education and the importance
of libraries alive is worthy,
and we support the masturba-
tor in his hard efforts.
Let’s hope they come to
fruition.
-How ‘bout dat Panther foot-
ball team an ‘at?

Thank you, Paul Hackett and
the Pitt football team for giving
us something else to do on

Saturdays like go to Hillman _

Library and work on our acad-
emic endeavors (or “hang out”
on the fourth floor.) You did
more for education than the
Bush administration did in four
years.

-Thank you, Telefact.

Thanks to them telephone-
book reading, encyclopedia-
sucking, almanac—eating, dictio-
nary—snorting personified info-
tracs. Sure, we like “Cheers” as
well, and we too aspire to live
the life of Cliff Claven.

-Thank you, Special Interest
Groups.

We give special thanks to
concerned members of our stu-
dent body without whom the
world would still be as equally
racist, environmentally un-
aware and sexist. Without you,
the world would still be a con-
fusing, mindless circus.
°To all patrons of the dearly
departed rock gods:

All the people who are faith-
fully devoted to Elvis Presley,
Jim Morrison and john Lennon
— we thank you for providing
the reporters of The Weekly
World News with a subsistence.
-To the four people who actu-
ally got this far in the column:

Get up, let go of this paper
and please  please get your-
self a life.

Antoine Jones is back.

Showing off improved offensive
skills, intense defense and renewed
rebounding vigor, Jones scored 14
points and pulled down 8
rebounds while sparking Pitt to a
99-68 rout of the Kazakhstan
National Team, last night at
Fitzgerald Field House.

After redshirting last season due
to a broken foot, Jones returned
physically stronger and more versa-
tile olfensively. Panther head coach
Paul Evans said Jones appeared
much more relaxed than in last
week’s exhibition debut against
Marathon Oil.

“Antoine was much improved
over last week,” Evans said. “He’s

we’ve got out there. We really are
counting on him. Last week I think
he was just little overanxious, a
little out of s, nch, whereas he set-

job for us tonight.”

Evans seemed particularly
pleased with Jones’ defensive effort
and the type of versatility that will
provide the Panthers in this sea-

“I think tonight he showed he
can play a kid like [Syracuse’s
Lawrence] Moten,” Evans said.

Junior center Eric Mobley and
sophomore power forward Chris
Gant both had outstanding games

vided a shining positive on a
night that was easy to forget
with stellar efforts on both ends
of the court.

In just 13 minutes of playing
time, Antigua was a force on
the court — both emotionally
and physically —-scoring eight
points on four-of-six shooting
and collecting eight big

Jones was just as sweet —
flashing the best of his all-
around ability against the
national team from the former
Soviet Union by dropping five

Gustafson’s powerful performance
keys Pitt volleyball’ s Big East title

By Chris Weber
Staff Writer

With a sprained left ankle and a contu-
sion under her left eye, you would have
thought Pitt sophomore volleyball player
Melanie Gustafson had been hit by a
truck.

But at the 1992
Big East Tournament
held this weekend at
the Fitzgerald Field
House, the only
people who felt like
they were hit by a
~ truck were the oppo-
nents left'in the powerful middle hitter’s
wake.

While most people may thinkof

 

‘junior All-America candidate Ann Marie

Lucanie as the dominating force on
this season’s Panther squad, Gustafson’s
impressive numbers and rise as an
impact player were a major part of the
Panthers’ winning the conference
tournament for the fifth. consecutive
year.

“I’m glad that of all the times to peak
it was right now when its most impor-
tant [to the teaml,” she said. 9 ‘

Despite a sprained ankle suffered last
weekend at the William and Mary
Tournament, as well as an eye injury
suffered in practice at the hands (actual-
ly a stray elbow) of Lucanie, the 6-foot
sophomore from Long Lake, Minnesota,
was unphase.

She thundered home quick kills and
displayed a competitive spirit that kept
Pitt focused on the conference title at
hand. -
Gustafson racked up 35 kills and 12
blocks over the three-game tournament,
and while most may be surprised at her
numbers, others were not.

“I’m not surprised,” head coach
Sue Woodstra said. “We’ve worked hard
with her, and she’s really done some
good things. I’m very pleased with her
work.”

“She’s been a real positive for us,”
assistant coach Cindy Braziel said.

“She’s really getting tough, and the
harder she plays the better she is.”

O'Neal leads Lion running
game in burial of Panthers

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

Before Penn State took the
field Saturday against Pitt,
Lion flanker O.J. McDuffie
was named a Kodak All-
American. He proceeded to
show why by catching eight
passes for 112 yards and a
touchdown, taking two
reverses for 25 yards and
returning two punts for 45
yards.

Richie Anderson entered
the game leading Penn State
with 771 rushing yards and
added 131 to that total —
including a 64-yard scoring
explosion in the second quar-
ter. _

The Lions’ stars shined in
Penn State’s 57-13 thrashing
of the Panthers, but it was
relatively unknown senior
fullback Brian O’Neal who
ran Pitt into the soaking wet
Beaver Stadium turf.

“Wow — L didn’t even

‘J- -.‘..‘...u.m'-.’-“s‘-'-..’.‘..’- ..u\.1-'».':.'u ‘..'z nu - -2 1.. ~. '-‘-. '.. *- '. ex. 1. . '.. '._

know about the fullback,” Pitt
head coach Paul Hackett said.
“That's a fine football team.
That's gotta be as fine a
group of running backs as
I’ve seen. Every back was
making it happen. It was just
too much for us.” ‘

The Lions romped all over
the Panthers, churning out
374 yards on 52 carries, an
average of 7.2 per attempt.

O’Neal pounded his way
for 105 yards and four touch-
downs on 14 carries. That
was the first 100-yard game of
the Cincinnati native’s career.

Early on, Pitt had some suc-
cess against the Penn State
running game as the Lions
tried to run outside  giving
the Panthers a‘ chance’ to use
their speed in pursuit.

The Lions shifted gears to
do what teams have done to
Pitt all year — _run it up the
middle. O’Neal was the bene-
ficiary.

O'Neal

Continued from page 9

“[Getting the ball more] helped me today,”
O’Neal said. '

Penn State got its first score of the game
after a 14-yard O’Neal burst, and a seven-yard
run by Anderson took the ball to the Pitt
three. Penn State turned to a play that burned
the Panthers all day. Lion quarterback Kerry
Collins faked a pitch to Anderson, stuffed the
ball into O’Neal’s gut, and the fullback
charged in for a 7-0 PSU lead.

In the second quarter, the Lions returned to
the same play — this time from the 11. O’.Neal
took the ball and found a wide open space
between himself and thetend zone.

“I was surprised to see that wide—open
field,” O’Neal said.

After the Panthers pulled within 10,
Anderson found plenty of open field on his
64-yard scoring run. Most of the attention

after the game went to McDuffie for nailing
Pitt corner Vernon Lewis down the field, but
it was a block by~O’Neal on linebacker Jason
Chavis at the line of scrimmage that set
Anderson loose.

O’Neal continued his personal assault in the
second half. After charging around the right
end for his third score, he got his fourth TD
with the same play as the first two.

“What we do on that is fake the pitch to
Richie Anderson,” O’Neal said. “I’m sure they
were afraid of [Anderson] getting the ball.
That gave me the opportunity to run up the
middle.” ‘

O’Neal said he was so fired up about get-
ting to run the ball that he considered show-
ing off his skills as a gymnast.

“It was exciting,” O’Neal said. “Every time a
play came in and it was to me, I was ready to
do a back flip.” -

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News

Brian O'Neal slammed through the Pitt defense for four
touchdowns Saturday at Beaver Stadium.

Pitt
Continued from page 9

For the 6—foot—7—inch Jones -
who sat out the entire ‘91-’92
campaign with a broken foot
— Wednesday night’s workout
was a major improvement over
his murky debut against
Marathon Oil last weekend — a
preview of things to expect in
the coming season

“Last week, I was overanx-
ious — [being] my first regular
game since two years ago,”
Jones said. “This week I was
more relaxed and let the game
come to me.”

After watching the senior
from Baltimore, Md., sweep the
boards and drop the shots with
equal aplomb, Pitt head coach
Paul Evans re—emphasized how
valuable Jones will be to the
success of the ‘92-’93 Panthers.

“We’re really counting on
him [this yearl,” head coach
Paul Evans said after the game.
“He’s worked on his shot a lot

. and is very confident out
there as a passer.”

While Jones displayed a new
wrinkle to his repertoire, name-
ly his improved offensive
game, Antigua continued to do
what he did best during his first
year as a Panther — play
inspired, in—your—face defense
while cleaning up the boards.

For the Bronx, N.Y., native,
the first trial run on his healing
left ankle went as well as his

 3%., H
".1  4 1'’

line score would indicate.

“It felt pretty good,” Antigua
said. “I was really excited to get
back out there, playing in front
of the crowd.

“My leg felt kind of loose —
almost back to normal.”

The anticipated inju_ry—free
return of both himself and
Jones to an already-solid front
line should make the Panthers
a force to be reckoned with in
the coming Big East season.

“I think the other schools [in
the conference] are going to
have a pretty hard time trying
to match up with us inside,”
Antigua said. “We still have a
lot of things to work on — as
far as running the offense.

“[But] that will come with
time.”

While Jones and Antigua pri-
marily play the small forward
position, both were on the
court at the same time
Wednesday. Though both will
continue to fight for the starting
nod at the three spot in the Pitt
lineup, the Versatile duo is not
going to lose any sleep over it
—— they will leave that to those
in charge.

“We don’t worry about that
too much,” Jones said. “We just
go to practice and work hard.

“[We’re] one team. I’m' leav-
ing that to the coach. I’m just
going to go out there and do
my-job.”

Continued from page 9

Sophomore Orlando Antigua
retumed from a sprained left ankle
to collect eight points and three
assists in an inspired 15 minutes of
action. With both Antigua and
Jones healthy, Evans hopes to get
40 solid minutes every night from
the small forward slot.

“It felt pretty good,” Antigua said.
“I was pretty excited to get back
out there. The leg felt pretty loose
— almost back to normal.”

However, one thing that is cer-
tainly not improving is Pitt’s
perimeter shooting. The outside
woes remain a primary area of
concern, with a true threat yet to
emerge.

“The perimeter shooting from
any place is still a problem,” Evans
said. “We’ve got some guys that
can shoot it they just have to get
relaxed and shoot it in the game.”

Pitt compensated by dominating
both ends of the glass. The
Panthers rotated a deep stable of
rebounders, with Jones, Gant and
Mobley all taking turns. Pitt outre-
bounded Kazakhstan 51-25 and so
thoroughly dominated that the
Panthers finished with 25 offensive
rebounds, matching Kazakhstan’s
entire total.

This game did not look like a
laugher in the first half. Pitt strug-
gled offensively, hitting just 14 of 51
field goals. But much of the incon-

sistency could be attributed to
Evans using all 15 of his players,
including 12 in the opening nine
minutes. The Panthers led 41-50
due to a 25-12 margin on the glass
and consistent free-throw shooting.
Forward Antone Youdin kept
Kazakhstan in the contest, scoring
nine of his game-high 21 points in
the opening session.

The second half was a different
story altogether. Pitt continued
sweeping the boards, but convert-
ed its transition game much better
and picked up defensive intensity.

Brian Brush spun inside for a
short turnaround to make it 47-38
Pitt. Then Jones took over the
boards. His second effort drew a
foul which he converted into two
free throws. He slashed through
the paint on the next trip, resulting
in two more free throws and a 51-
58 Panther margin. Alex Krivenyki
answered for Kazakhstan with a
short jumperoff glass but Marlon
Rhymes came right back with a
three—pointer from the left side,
making it 54-40 Pitt.

Alex Gutorov pumped in three
of his 16 points, draining a trey to
cut it to 54-45. Then Brush’s transi-
tion hustle resulted in an easy lay-
up and a 15-point cushion. Antigua
gathered in an errant pass and
threw down a one-handed slam. At
that point Pitt was ﬁrmly in control
at 

Youdin charged back with four
consecutive points on a free throw
and a three-pointer, but Jones tick-
led the twine with a pretty tum-
around jumper in the lane to push
Pitfs lead to 60-47.

Antigua inspired the crowd of
4,585 with a second and third effort
on the glass, gathering himself for a
strong lay-in. Then Brush and
Rhymes executed a textbook tWO-
on-one break with Brush getting
the easy deuce to push Pitt’s
lead to 64-47. Antigua skied for a
lay-in off Rhymes’ lob to make it
6749 and Pitt coasted home.

Garbage time was in full stride I

when Gant rocked the rim, harn-
mering down a monster slam that
lit up the crowd and gave Pitt a 25-
bulge with just over six minutes
remaining. Then first—year skywalk-
er Garrick Thomas drained a three-
pointer from the right corner to
make it 85-54. Mobley drove home
the victory with a two—handed
monster jam from Rhymes.
Panther Paws: Evans said Antigua
is not back to 100 percent yet, but
his ankle is improving day by day.
Pitt hit just 3-15 from three—point
land, a pathetic .251, but harassed
Kazakhstan into a inept 5-16 effort
from trey land. Panther Paul was
missing in action and did not per-
fonn for the students. Panther dunk
watch — four, Mobley with two,
Gant and Antigua with one each.

Chris Palmiero/The Pitt News

-Brian Brush could not reach this ball, but Pitt dominated the
boards against Kazakhstan last night.

MC./Veal walks the walla wit/aoaz‘ ta!/emig I/oe Ital/e

Byjason Brarne
Staﬂ“ Writer

Brian Brush was jokingly boasting about
the two free throws he made against
Marathon Oil the previous night, when
Chris McNeal caught wind of it.

Brush pressed on about how he cooly
dropped two shots without catching any
rim at all, but both times he stepped to the
line on this early practice he clumsily rat-
tled them in, drawing much more iron
then he had bragged about.

McNeal — “Big Daddy” to fans and
friends — calmly called for the rock,
stepped to the line and drained two shots
from the stripe, clean as glass, and no iron.

Muhammad Ali once said, “It ain’t brag-
gin’ if you can back it up,” but, while
McNeal can obviously defend most every-
thing he says on the court, he is the
last person on the team to boast. And
although McNeal would be the last to tell
you, he holds the key to the Panthers’ sea-

' SO11.

McNeal, a former Prop 48 casualty, has
proven to be the mainstay in the Panthers’
line—up for his three years in a Pitt uni-
fonn. A bench player his rookie year in
the Big East, the 6—foot—7—inch power for-

ward has seen his game steadily progress
to the point of a level of prominence, not
only within the conference but also in the
country.

McNeal, however, disagrees with the
notion that he is near the top of the list of
power forwards in the nation.

“I don’t know if I’m one of the elite, but
I think that I’m a very good player,”
McNeal said.  of the accolades that are
coming at the end of the year will come,
but you have to put together a whole sea-
son [to receive the benefits]. So whatever
happens, happens.”

‘The June NBA draft is clearly important
to a strong player such as McNeal, but it is
not the top thing on his mind.

“First of all, I’m trying to get through the
season,” McNeal said. “If [getting draftedl
comes, it comes, and I hope that I get a
shot at the next level. But if I don’t, I’m
going to get a degree and go on with my
life. But I definitely want to go on with
basketball as far as I can go.”

He does, however, feel that he can con-
tribute to an NBA team and that he pos-
sesses a dimension that most men his size
do not. He employs the standard weapons
of most all big men, strong rebounding
and low post scoring. He features a soft

touch around the basket that — save for
the Charles Barkleys and Billy Owens of
the game —— is a feature that most big men
do not develop.

“Most guys who are power forwards in
the league can’t hit the open shot, so that
brings a little extra to my game,” McNeal
said.

As far as patterning his game after any
particular player, McNeal stated that
although he appreciates the game of
Golden State Wauior and former Syracuse
Orangeman Billy Owens, he does not feel
there is anyone out there that has exactly
the same qualities as he does.

“I like Billy Owens’ game because he’s
real versatile,” McNeal stated. “'I’d like to
be versatile like that. I always try to finda
certain player" that I play like, but every
time I do I find something he does a little
better than I do or something I can do that
he can’t. There really isn’t anyone out
there who is 6’8”, can rebound and shoot
the 15-footer.” _

McNeal had an excellent opportunity to
cultivate all aspects of his game this sum-
mer, as he and several otherathletes
toured Europe on the Foot Locker Team
_NIT All-star squad. Theteam traveled to

Thomas
brings air
show to
Panthers

By Chris Weber
Staff Writer

It figures that Garrick
Thomas enjoys flying model
airplanes in his spare time.
After all, what else would you
expect from someone who
likes to soar — above the
rim?

Thomas, a first—year guard
for the Pitt basketball team, is
no stranger to the term “fre-
quent flyer.”

A gifted athletic talent, the
6—foot—4—inch, 195—pound
Houston, Texas, native has
been racking up the mileage
points since the ninth grade
— gliding through the air and
dunking with a variety of aer-
ial maneuvers that would
make an F-16 jealous.

Anyone who saw him win
this year’s Pittsburgh
Roundball Classic Slam Dunk
contest or last month’s
Midnight Madness dunk fest
can attest to that.

Thomas rarely refers to the
fact that it sometimes seems
like he could jump out of a
building. When Thomas talks
about his strengths, he hardly
mentions his jumping ability.
He talks like he needs a
ladder just to hop into
bed.

“God gifted me with the tal-
ent to jump, and it’s not
something everyone can do,”
Thomas says. “But it’s not the
most important thing to me
when I step onto the court. I
enjoy dunking, and I’ll do it
anytime I get the chance, but
there is more to my game
than that.”

Among the strengths that
Thomas brings to this sea-
son’s Panther squad are a ver-
satility to play the off guard
and small forward position,
an ability to get out on the
wing quickly on the fast
break, a toughness on

- defense and a positive atti-

tude.

“I want to do things just to
help the team win,” he said.
“I have to work a bit on my
ballhandling and passing, but
as long as I do what’s needed
on the defensive end, the
offensive end will take care
of itself.”

As a senior at MacArthur
High School in Houston,
offense was no problem.
Thomas averaged 19 points,
11 rebounds and four assists
per game. In one game,
Thomas poured in 46 points,

‘grabbed 15 rebounds, dished

off 10 assists and committed
eight thefts.

In addition, Thomas was
considered among the top 10
college prospects in the state
and was rated among the top
200 prospects in the country
by one national high school
publication. After narrowing

Gant powers his way into key role for Panthers

By Bennett Zamoff
Staﬂ Writer

You can find them on every basketball
team. _

When the starting lineup takes the floor,
they are sitting on the bench.

When the fans in the stands heap praise
on their heroes, their names are seldom
mentioned.

And when the media shines their spot-
light after the game, their faces rarely glit-
ter in the glow.

They are the players who only the true
fans ever seem to appreciate. The hustlers
and the workhorses. The smart passers.

‘The sleek defenders. The strong rebound-

ers.

They are the guys on the team whose
efforts on the ﬂoor don’t always show up
on the postgame stat sheet.

They are the role players.

And on this year’s Pitt Panther basket-
ball team, there is none other quite like
Chris Gant. ,

Last year, the 6—foot-7~inch forward from
Houston, Texas, came off the bench in 31
of the Panthers’ 34 games, quietly estab-
lishing himself as a player with a tough set
of inside moves, a keen court awareness
and an exceptional versatility that enabled
Pitt head coach Paul Evans to rely on him

to play both forward positions.

Gant averaged just 3.9 points and 2.4
rebounds a game for Pitt that season ——
his first in Panther blue and gold. But his
steady play outside the numbers — and
off the stat sheet — are what made him
one of the most reliable Panthers for
Evans to go to all season long.

And what gave him the label “role play-
Gant said it’s a label that he doesn’t
mind carrying with him — for now.

“I was a freshman last year so I didn’t
expect to come in and get too much
time,” Gant said. “But I understand my
role. I am a role player for now.”

That means that like last season, the
player his teammates like to call “Country”
will spend this season once again doing
all the things a role player does. He’ll still
come off the bench, and he’ll still give the
team some quality minutes wherever in
the lineup Evans may put him.

But the potential he showed inside last
year — undemeath the punishing rigors of
the Big East boards — showed that there
may well be a whole lot more to come
from Gant.

For Gant, the physical inside wear and
tear of his first year in the Big East was
something of an adjustment from Smiley
High School back home in Houston.

“It was a big step coming from high
school to the more physical play," Gant
said. “The Big East is probably the most
physical conference there is. I knew it
would be physical, but I didn’t know it
would be this physical. I guess once you
get here you just experience it for your-
self.”

Gant’s one year of Big East pounding
gave him a pretty speciﬁc idea of how to
spend his offseason — bulk up and
become a more powerful force down low.

He spent half his summer in Pittsburgh
and half in Houston. Wherever he was, a
set of weights was within his grasp.
“Country” beefed up 10 pounds, from 215
at the start of his first year to 225 at the
start of this season.

“If anything, I would give myself an “A”
on that because that’s mainly what I did
this summer,” Gant said. “I knew that I
was gonna play down low this year, and
from last year I knew how physical it was,
so I put emphasis on that.”

Gant said he thinks that his new muscle
and the strength and inside agility of a few
of his teammates should make Pitt the
most dominating rebounding team in the
conference this season.

“We should lead the conference in

A rebounding this year,” Gant said. “We’ve

got me, E [Eric Mobley,l Chris [Mc Neal]

‘.7{£5‘I}’l‘Zl'.7{$’l£7\[1"

and Antoine Uones,l and those are four big
guys. We should control the boards.”

But Gant’s game in the low post wasn't
the only thing he worked on over the
summer. A little practice on some outside
moves was also on his offseason agenda.

By working on his outside shot and
ball—handling skills, Gant concentrated on
trying to develop into a more complete
player — more dangerous and more valu-
able. -~
 year I’m gonna stick to my inside
game,” Gant said, “But I’m trying to also
move it outside, so I can have two
weapons. Either I can take you down low,
or I can bring you outside. I can use two
weapons.”

Inside or outside, down low or up high,
one thing is for sure — bigger and better
things are likely in store for Gant. All he
has to do is keep moving down that path
of progression. ‘

It’s a long, tough path, but it’s a path

Gant laid out for himself last year.
I And even if the experts are not betting
on an extremely strong Pitt season, a ver-
satile, role—playing forward from Houston,
may help the Panthers make a little noise
this year after all.

“Everybody’s doubting us,” Gant said.
“But I think we’re gonna surprise a few
people.”

Sports Assistant

One is Pitt’s fiery and high-spirited

1 defensive demon. Enthusiasm is his

trademark, punctuated by the animaté
ed clapping of his 'hands;‘an‘d the per—'
petual hollering of encouragement to
his Ifantl1er,_teian1ma;t_es.  "L

Keeping a low-profile demeanor, he
often appears nonchalant, but his

crowd—pleasing creativity is anything I

but.

Both are sophomores who landed
here from New York City, but that is
where the similarities between
Orlando Antigua and Jerry
McCullough end. While Antigua’s
vocal presence injects life into the
Panthers, McCullough chooses to lead
by example.

One thing is for certain. Both of
these rising stars will be counted
uponbheavily to step up if Pitt is to
challenge for one of the top spots in
the Big East. . _

McCullough, a 5—foot-11-inch point
guard out of Harlem’s Rice High
School, had a promising but up-and-
down rookie season. With Sean Miller
still manning the point, McCullough’s
role fluctuated from one game to the
next, and the uncertainty made him

reasons which I wasn’t even told for,”
McCullough said. "'I’d find out after
the game.”

Although his individual opportuni-
ties did not unfold as he would have
liked, McCullough» said that Pitt’s wins

‘were the. bright spots. N

“Basically, the games we all

Che said. l W l l  V‘ A‘
' _j*McC,u1lough flashed -glimpses of his

p_ro‘mising potential, a-ve~ragaing§7.4
points, .2.7 assists and a club'—high 114
steals. He excels in the transition
game while possessing quick hands
and solid defensive abilities.
McCullough said his confidence never
wavered despite the inconsistent min-
utes he received.

“I have confidence in everything,”
he said.

Much of that is due to the natural
flow of his game, ‘where instincts take
over everything on the ﬂoor.

“Confidence is never an issue with
Jerry,”.Antigua said. “Jerry has a lot of
confidence in himself and I think [last
year] was the factor of the coaches
not playing him a little more because
he was, at times, playing good and
practicing, and they wouldn’t award

Mobley bade and soon to be baldfor monstrous year in middle

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

He’s back! He’s in better
shape, he’s making free
throws and — again — he’s
soon-to—be bald.

He’s Eric Mobley.

Pitt’s imposing center
returns this year ready to
shave his head again to signi-
fy that Pitt’s rejuvenated big
man has arrived

“For the first game [of the
regular season] I’ll be bald,”
Mobley said of his trademark.
“I want people to know he’s
back with the bald head."

The 6-foot—11-in_ch junior
can now show the fans how
much he has improved his
game. He is head coach Paul
Evans’ starting center, a job
that has awaited him the last
three years.

“When I went to Allegany
[Md.] Community College, he
[Evans] told me that he
-wouldn’t recruit another cen-
ter,” Mobley said. “He lEvansl
kept his end of the deal, and
I’ll keep mine.”

Mobley’s end of the deal
was to work hard and
improve to become a fear-
some force in the Big East.
That paid off, and now he is
the sole center on the Panther
squad and has done several
things during the offseason to
improve his game.

Mobley had problems from
the free—throw line last sea-

son, shooting a measly 41
percent. Now in the starting
role, Mobley’s game from the
line had to improve. And it
has.

“I’m shooting 100 free
throws after practice,” Mobley
said of the drills he is doing
to tryand resolve his prob-
lem. “I’ve improved dramati-

cally, I’ve slowed down and

I’m taking more time instead
of rushing the shot.”

Playing a tough inside game
a year ago, Mobley is looking
to improve in that area as
well.

“It’s hard to say,” Mobley
said of his inside game. “Well
have to wait until the Big East
season to tell.”

When the conference sea-
son arrives, Mobley will face
a bunch of new faces around
the league. The’Big East cen-
ters, including Mobley, have
not proven themselves within
the paint. The lone exception
is Boston College’s Bill
Curley, someone who Mobley
said he respects.

“I look at Bill Curley,”
Mobley said. “He has good

post moves and is the type of '

player you have to watch.”

Mobley has always been the
type of player to watch.
Dating back to his high
school days in the Bronx,
Mobley averaged 20.5 points,
11.7 rebounds and a tremen-
dous 6.5 blocks per game at
Salesian High School.

At Salesian, Mobley led his
team to the Class B
Championship game and was
rated as the top big man in
New York City in 1989.
Mobley was also touted as

one of the top 50 prospects ;

in the country and once
blocked a whopping 20 shots
in a single high school game.

Hoping that he will again .

be a player to watch in the
Big East, Mobley had an
impressive season a year ago.
After a year—and-a-half layoff
(sitting out after transferring

from Allegany), he came back *

to average 7.2 ppg. and 4.6

rpg. and became an intimidat— —

ing force with his specialty —
the blocked shot. _

“It feels good knowing I
can get it [block the shot], it’s
like a guard making an
assist,” Mobley said. “You got
to let them [the opposing
shooters] know you are
there.”

By blocking shots, a total of
57 last season, Mobley’s
defense should give the

Panthers a lift. Along with.

senior forward Chris McNeal,

Pitt should have a good grasp‘

on the boards. Mobley said
there are some weaknesses
on the team.

“We got a lot of weakness-
es,” Mobley said. “We’ve had
a lot of turnovers. But I think
we can score anytime we
want to, we just got to pick

R/93/mes,
smooth as
his name

By Jim Lakely
Managing Editor

Stepping off the court after
filming a public service
announcement, Pitt’s latest

junior collegeitransfer proved -j

that his moves are as smooth
as his name.

A name that rings through
the rafters of Fitzgerald Field
House with a sweet resonance.
A name that screams for show-
time. The name —— Marlon
Rhymes.

“It’s my mom that made it
up and I thank her for it
everyday,” Rhymes said. “She
could have called me some-
thing like Donald.”

Doesn’t have the same ring.

Pitt head coach Paul Evans
plucked the 6—foot—4—inch, 165-

pound guard from Central.

Pirates picked to steal top spot in Big East basketball

The Pitt News ‘Big East
Pre-Season Poll

(The number next to the
team is the total points
the team recieved in the
poll. Ten members of The
Pitt News sports staff
voted, ten points for the
first place team, 1 for the
last place team. Seton
Hall recievea’ all ten first-
place. votes.)

1. SETON HALL 140
Terry Dehere and Jerry

Walker have been together
since their days at St.
Anthony’s High School in
Jersey City, N.J. '

Now the two seniors will
lead the Seton Hall Pirates to
the top of the Big East.

The Pirates shared the con-
ference regular season title
last season with St. John’s.
With their only -forward
Gordon Winchester gone,
they should be the class of
the conference.

Leading scorer Dehere (19.4

ppg) was selected as the

Preseason Player of the Year
by the Big East coaches. He is
the main gunner with an
excellent three-point shot.
When he is on from outside,
Seton Hall can play with any-'
body.

Walker is a strong defender

as well as a solid scorer and
rebounder_(13.7 ppg, 7.4 rpg).’
After spending the summer
helping the Lithuanian
olympic team win a bronze
medal, junior Artura-s
Karnishovas returns as‘the
other forward. He was the
best in the conference from
long range, hitting at a .520
clip from beyond the line dur-
ing league play.
‘ Sophomore forward John
Leahy is another quality out-
side shooter who should see
more playing time with
Winchester gone.

The center is monstrous
Luther Wright. The question is
whether that describes his
size or how he plays. For all
his ability, he has yet to show
he can be even a good Big
East center’. .

Bryan Caver will return to‘
run the show from the point.
Senior Daryl Crist and another

' St. Anthony grad, sophomore

Danny Hurley, provide back-
court depth.. '
-Ryan Buncher

2. GEORGETOWN 110

Everyone thinks that Bill
Clinton is the new “big man”
in Washington, D.C., this year.
Not so. Big East newcomer
Othella Harrington is 6-feet-
10-inches, 220 pounds and
has come to the University of

» Georgetown from Mississippi

to carry on the Hoya tradition
of talented centers.

Like he did with Patrick
Ewing 10 years ago, head
coach John Thompson is car-
rying a piece of paper in his
pocket that says “18 years
old;” Harrington, who shuns
all comparisons to Ewing,
Dikembe Mutombo and
Alonzo Morning, will give the
Hoyas bulk up front in the
Big‘East this year.

Also joining the Hoyas is
first-year player Duane

Spencer, a 6’-10” versatile for-~

ward with a deft shooting
touch on a wiry frame. The
two newcomers will find their
way into the starting line-up,
joining juniors Robert
Churchwell and Joey Brown
and sophomore Irvin Church.

Churchwell fills the mold of
the quintessential small for-
ward with his athletic ability
and could make a very potent
complement to the muscle of
Harrington and the finesse of
Spencer.

The Hoyas’ heart and soul is
point guard Joey Brown. As
Thompson’s coach on the
floor, Brown is a pesky
defender and can hit the cru-
cial free throws. Although a
streaky shooter, Brown is one
of the most underrated play-
ers in the country and is the
best point guard in the Big
East.'.Church is a dependable
outside shooter at the two
spot.

- Like every other Hoya team,
this one’s strength is in its
defense. But if Harrington and
Spencer prove their billing
and Brown and Church can
give support from the perime-
ter, this Georgetown team
may steal the headlines from
the president elect.

-Matt Silverman

3. CONNECTICUT 109

To paraphrase Shakespeare, '

University of Connecticut

head coach Jim Calhoun ‘
could very well find himself _

on a Big East hoops battle-
ground this year bellowing,
“A point guard, a point guard,
my kingdom for a point
guard!” ‘

‘It will be a difficult task for
Calhoun this season to find an
able replacement for graduat-
ed senior Chris Smith, the Big
East’s leading scorer last sea-
son (21.1 ppg) and ‘a first

team All-Big East selection at.

be ready to assume Smith’s
playmaking duties, 6’2” junior
college transfer Covington
Cormier, who averaged 21
ppg at Clarendon (TX) JC and
will be asked to deliver at
both the point, and the two-
spot and 6’3” sophomore
Brian Fair, who will try to
improve on a shaky frosh
campaign at the off guard.

Up front, the Huskies are
strong and experienced. Six-
foot-seven-inch senior Scott
Burrell (16.3 ppg, 6.1 rpg) will
be the go-to man in the clutch
offensively and will hit the
glass hard with senior Toraino
Walker (7.8 rpg) and sopho-
more face—job artist Donyell
Marshall (78 blocks_ last sea-
son). _

Aside from questions in the
backcourt, UConn should be
tough with its returning cast.
Look for a dynamite year from
Burrell, a first—team preseason
all-Big East pick who should
be even more focused on
hoops this season after expe-
riencing arm trouble this sum-
mer while pitching for the

Toronto Blue Jays’ farm sys—_

tem. With his two—sport career
aspirations dampened, Burrell
should be doubly tough.

This season, look for the

‘dogs to’. have the bite to match

their bark. .

4. BOSTON COLL. 97
“The Heights,” commonly
known as the scenic Boston
College campus, is once again
flying highthis year with an
aura of basketball madness.
The frenzy is over the great
improvement Boston College
showed last year and the con-
tinued progresslthat head’
coach Jim O’Brien’s Eagles
expect to show this season.
The Eagles, 17-11 overall
last season, will be competing

for one of the top spots in the .

Big East. Although BC was
only 7-11 in Big East competi-
tion a year ago, the’Eagles
beat conference powerhouses
Seton Hall and Georgetown.

Um‘:n,-comm 0:31:-0 -+—om:Jo Oz.

 

Leading the Eagles from
their nest will be junior Bill
Curley. The 6-foot-9-inch cen-
ter averaged 17.8 ppg. and 8.1
rpg. last year and was the key
man—in-the-middle for BC. His
ability to “bang away’_’ irl the

.paint and hustle for every

point makes him'the Eagles’
top bird.

In the backcourt the Eagles
are loaded. Junior guards
Howard Eisley, Malcolm
Huckaby and Gerrod Abram
give O’Brien‘the best perime-
ter shooting team in the Big
East. Eisley (11.3 ppg, 4.4
rpg.) will direct BC’s offense,
while Huckaby and Abram
will shoot the 

With such a potent back-
court, O’Brien brought two
solid recruits to “The Heights”
to help Curley under the net.
Robert Blackwell, from
Brooklyn, and Paul Grant,
from Michigan, will use their
athletic ability and size to
relieve the pressured Curley.
At 6’8”, Blackwell is a versa-
tile forward andswingman.
While at 6’10”, Grant should
provide the height the Eagles
need to win in this confer-
ence.

“The Heights” is reach-ing
for the clouds. _

ence.

The only substantial loss
was forward David Johnson, a
first—round choice by the

NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers.

The 6'5” Moten delighted.

ing and tough,‘ gritty play.
Scoring duties will be shared
by Moten and Adrian Autry, a

his eligibility.

Center Conrad McRae must

Byjason Brame.
and Neil Chaudhuri
The Pitt News

Last season, the University of
Pittsburgh women’s basketball
team was plagued by nagging
injuries and inconsistent play,
but head coach Kirk Bruce has
a lot to look forward to from
his Panthers this season. His
entire team is healthy and
returns'with all five starters
from last year.

The excitement over that is
tempered by the fact that those
starters were on a squad that
compiled only an 11-18 record
last season. Do not tell the
coach that.

“The [difficult Big East]
schedule hit us at a time where
we weren’t playing well,”_
Bruce said about his team’s

mid—seasoh slide and subse-

quent losing record. “We hit
some really tough teams at a

time when we had some

injuries.” A

Ironically, that mid-season
slide may benefit the 1992-93
team because, as a result,
every returner saw some play-
ing time. Bruce will count on

_this valuable experience to

help the Panthers fare well

g against a tough Big East sched-

ule.

“The Big East is always tight
atthe top, tight in the middle
and tight at the last four spots,”

 

Junior Jill Colabrese brings versatility to the Pitt front line. .

Bruce said. “The good thing
about that is no matter who
you are, you still have a
chance to beat the best teams
in the conference. You can
beatlthe top. teams, but you
can’t» do it on a consistent
basis.”

According to a preseason
poll among Big East coaches,
Miarniis favored to win the
conference by a wide margin.

Despite losing Big East Player

of the Year Frances Savage,
the Hurricanes have recruited a
lot of fresh, young talent.
Georgetown, Connecticut and

Seton Hall also garnered first-
place votes to finish two, three
and four respectively. The
coaches picked the Panthers to
ﬁnish-seventh. , ' "

Despite the intense competi-
tion in the Big East, Bruce is

optimistic about his team’s’

chances this season.

“We feel we have as good a
shot as anyone to finish in the
top three if we keep healthy,”

Bruce said. “If we do that, with,

the girls we have, we feel that
we can definitely finish in the

top three or four in the confer-.

ence. ”

Despite his high expecta-
tions, Bruce said that all he
asks of his players is aggres-
sive, consistent play_.

“As a coach you can only
ask for effort,” Bruce said. “If
you go out and give 100 per-
cent every day, you’ll be _in a
lot of games, and that’s where
we want to be.” , -

Offense will be stressed this
season. The Panthers’ previous
scoring averages have been a
problem for the team to com-
pete inside of the conference.

“\Ve’ll definitely- have to
score more,” Bruce said. “I’m a

The most obvious strength of
the team will be its perimeter
shooting. Bruce has the luxury
of five bona fide three’-point
threats in his lineup.

“You can never have enough
perimeter shooting,” Bruce
stressed. “We’ve got some girls
who I consider pretty good
outside threats —— I’m talking
about from three-point land.”

Among Bruce’s starting five
are two Big East all-stars,

Jonna Huemrich and Jill ”

Colabrese. ,
Huemrich will be Bruce’s
floor leader this season. The
second-team All-Big East selec-
tion led the team in scoring
last season (16.4) and will be’
expected to carry the load on
both ends of the court.
_ “Leadership is very impor-
tant, no doubt about it,” Bruce
said. “Jonna can ﬂat out play,
but we’re looking for her to
raise her game to the next
level, scoring and otherwise.

pressure on her because if she

Forest to PZU

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer .

Forest City is a small town
20 miles north of Scranton,
PA. The star basketball player
of Forest City Regional High
School was well known by all
in his surrounding communi-
ty. He earned state—wide hon-
ors as he was named 1992
Pennsylvania Small School
Player of the Year.

This 6—foot—4-inch guard is
Jason Maile, and he is now
starting from square one
again as a first-year player on
the ‘Panther basketball squad
this year. And he has all the
tools to become as prominent
at Pitt as he was at Forest City
even though the comparison
between the two programs
are‘ night and day.

“Jason should provide
immediate help at the two-
guard position.” head coach

Paul Evans said. “He is an,

excellent outside shooter and
could be the perimeter scor-
ing threat that we need.”

Maile also thinks he is
capable of contributing right
away.

“I think I can help right
away,” Maile said. “My main
concern right now is to learn
the system.” '-

Maile is considered to have
a lethal outside shot. He

sistency that has plagued
head coach Paul Evans and
the entire program.

Sophomore Jerry McCull-
ough, who saw time at point
guard last year, will take the
reigns of the team. The hard-
driving McCullough will have
to learn to control his game
and think pass. Joining him in
the backcourt is a 6—foot—3-

‘inch junior Ahmad Shareef,

who has yet to blossom as a
consistent contributor.

Arizona State Junior College
transfer Marlon Rhymes is a
versatile creator and will see
time at both guard spots.
High—flying 6’4” rookie
Garrick Thomas brings in
plenty of athletic ability, but
the rest of his game will
have to catch up for him to
make any im— pact.

After sitting out his first year
as a Prop 48 victim, Eric
Mobley returned last year and
hopefully picked up some
pointers from the departed
Morningstar. Mobley is an ath-
letic 6’11” and must be ready
to fill the full-time vacancy at
center. '

Senior power forward Chris
McNeal will hold down the
bulwark on a solid and deep
front line. McNeal averaged
14.4 points a game and pulled
down an average of 9.1
rebounds. Antoine Jones, who
sat out last season with a foot

injury, is back for his. senior

seasorl and will provide versa-
tility and hard work from the
small forward spot.

Another hard working for-
ward is- sophomore Orlando
Antigua. The agile 67” New
York City native averaged
41.7 percent on three-pointers

and plays all out every min-
ute.

The Panthers have the talent
to be conference contenders.
If they can get rebounds from
the front court and someone
can control the offense, they
could surprise people.

The sidelines on the

Mainline will never be the
same. -

After 19 years at Villanova, 1

Rollie Massimino bolted for
UNLV,.leaving behind a stag-
nant program looking to shed
its label of mediocrity.

Do not bet on the regime of
new head coach Steve Lappas
starting slowly. Lappas’
approach should spice up the
Wildcats’ stale -offense.

‘Nova’s fate rests with the
multi—talented Lance Miller
(14.9 ppg/5.7 rpg). The 6-
foot—6—inch senior swingman
from Bridgewater, N.J., should
flourish under Lappas and lift
his smooth game to a new

level.

At this point, it appears the
versatile Miller will fill the’ off
guard slot, solidifying the
backcourt. Regardless of posi-
tion, Miller is a winner and a
legitimatecandidate for Big
East Player of the Year.

Temple transfer Jonathon
Haynes will run the show,
and his _presence alone could
lift the Cats from mediocre to
dangerous. ‘Nova insiders are
raving about the ballhandling
wizardry of Haynes, the 1990
Pennsylvania. High School

The key to the Cats’ season
could be finding a capable
running mate for Haynes.

That would free Miller to slide
to the small forward slot,
where he is unstoppable. That
missing link could be 6’4”
freshman Roscoe Harris, a
shooting guard out of Jersey
City.

For now, Lappas could face
a rebounding deficiency with
two seniors — 6’7” Arron Bain
and 6’6” Calvin Byrd — man-
ning the forward posts. Bain
has a deadly jumper and Byrd
possesses defensive tenacity,
but both need to step up
other facets of their games for
‘Nova to finish in the top four.

The Cats will be tough in
the ‘middle, throwing the two-
headed monster of James
Bryson and Anthony Pelle at a
center—depleted conference.
Bryson (9.2 ppg/5.9 rpg)
developed consistency late
last season while the seven-
foot junior Pelle is a raw but
intimidating force inside.

role the past two years. What
will hurt the Redmen the most
is the lack of shooting. They
have no one who has shown
he can step up and hit the
clutch shot in the end of the
game.

The rich tradition of St.

With no star who usually

no outside shooting, St. John’s

Last year the Providence
Friars were largely comprised
of young, unseasoned players.
Their inexperience showed in
a 14-17 overall record (6-12 in
the Big East).

This year the Friars hope
that the chemistry they devel-
oped last season will help
them to improve their stand-
ing despite the loss of team
captain Marques Bragg.

Providence was an excellent
defensive team in the 1991-’92
campaign, ranking seventh
nationally in rebound margin
(7.4) and field goal percent-
age defense (.399). This sea-
son head coach Rick Barnes is
looking to improve the team’s

the point last season, averag-
ing close to 20 minutes per
contest, and that should make
for a smooth transition. As far
as this season is concerned,
McCullough’s role should be
more defined. Now it is his
offense to run.

“We have to develop chem-
istry with it, like with any
offense,” McCullough said.
“You have to develop it

according to the people we

have.”

Two of those integral parts
reside in the low blocks, cen-
ter Eric Mobley and power for-
ward Chris McNeal. They will
often be looked to as the first
options in Paul Evans’ offen-
sive sets.

“T hat’s what it’s been every
year since the system was put
in,” McCullough said. “The
system is for the big men
first.” _

But the effectiveness of
those big men down low
depends a great deal on the
maturity and development of
Pitt’s new quarterback.

“I think Jerry compared to
last year  is more con-
trolled,” Antigua said. “He
realizes his position, in which
he has to get the rest of the
team involved in the offense
and how he has to play
defense and show his leader-
ship on the floor. I think
maybe last year he might have
penetrated just thinking about
scoring, where this year he’s
penetrating looking to create
something for somebody else.
He’s looking to dish the ball
out a little more, to get every-
body else involved in the
game.” '

Over the summer
McCullough returned home to
polish his game while playing
with Kentucky’s All—American
forward Jamal Mashburn.
There‘ is no doubt that
McCullough’s creativelskills
should blend well in Pitt’s
new up-tempo approach. But
the playmaker will also be
counted upon to score more.

He reached double figures
nine times last season, includ-
ing a 21-point effort in Pitt’s
77-68 upset of nationally-
ranked Seton Hall at Fitzgerald
Field House. McCullough shot
just 39 percent from the floor
last season, but did hit a
respectable 50 of 82 (.366)
from three-point range.
McCullough said he worked
on his shooting during the off-
season, hoping to develop
more range on his jumper.

“I guess the season will have
to tell. From shooting alone I
guess I did limprovel,” he said.

Antigua, a lanky 6’7” for-
ward from the Bronx burst on

the scene last season, starting _

21 of Pitt’s 34 contests at small
forward, including 12 confer-
ence games.

A standout center at St.
Raymond’s High School,
Antigua readily accepted the
challenge of learning an
entirely new position that
required completely different
skills — playing the “three”
spot. This forcP“l him to face

the basket and develop a solid
perimeter game after playing
with his back to the basket his
entire life.

At times he struggled offen-

sively, but proved he can be
an effective scorer — a testa-
ment to his relentless work
ethic.
' “I’ve never doubted myself
about scoring,” Antigua said.
“I’ll put it up every time if
they let me. But I also have to
get the rest of the’ team
involved, and Ihave to do
what’s best for us to win. And
if sometimes that means
shooting then I’ll have to
shoot it. If other times that
means passing I guess that’s
what I have to do.”

Antigua averaged 6.5 points
and 2.6 rebounds in just under
19 minutes per game, and
often played his best in big
games. In Pitt’s early season
upset at Kentucky, Antigua
scored nine points, pulled
down eight rebounds and
swatted four shots. He scored
15 points to go with seven
rebounds in front of his home-
town crowd at St. John’s and
scored acareer-high 18 at the
Carrier Dome in Syracuse.

The name of his game is
hustle, and there aren’t too
many players anywhere that
give as much as Antigua. The
conference coaches thought
highly enough of him to select
him to the Big East’s All-
Rookie team, an honor that
caught Antigua by surprise.

“At first I was very surprised
‘cause compared to the rest of
the guys who were also nomi-
nated, I think they had a bet-
ter individual season than
what I had,” he said. “I was
kind of happy and kind of
hoping to use that towards my
confidence. And if the coaches
can see that, that means that I
must be doing something
right.”

Much of that All-Rookie
recognition can be attributed
to his superior defensive skills.
Even as a true first-year play-
er, Antigua often drew the
assignment of guarding the
opposition’s top gun. But
Antigua said there is "no secret
formula.

“That’s all hard work and

heart. When I get out ‘there I"

just try to make the offense
turn, try to throw them off
synch,” he said. “Just harass
thema little bit, just to "give
the other guys on my team
enough chance to get some
picks or whatever.”

He fine-tuned his skills play-
ing in a summer league in
Carolina, Puerto Rico, just out-
side of San Juan. Antigua
worked on his shooting and
ball—handling while trying to
add some weight to his slight
frame.

“Last year was the first year I
ever had to pass from the out-
side position, dribble with my
left, shoot the outside shot,
penetrate and try to dish,” he
said. “Last year was the first
year, so I kind of struggled. I
had a lot of turnovers.
Working over the summer in
Puerto Rico I think has helped
me get a little more familiar
with the position, and hope-
fully I’ll continue to keep
learning and keep getting bet-
ter at the position.”

However, Antigua’s second
Panther campaign is not off to
an auspicious start. Antigua
sprained his left ankle severely
during a pickup game in con-
ditioning. Ironically, it was an
injury to last year’s projected
starter at small forward, senior
Antoine Jones, that gave
Antigua the opportunity to
contribute so much so soon.
Antigua missed the final two
weeks of conditioning but
returned to practice right after

his college choices to Pitt
and Texas, Thomas settl-
ed on becoming a Panth-
er.

“I felt more comfortable
here,” he said. “Also, I
hope to go into a business
finance program, and Pitt
seemed a little bit better
education-wise. Also,
the level of competition

’_ is better in the Big

East.” ‘ »
. While Thomas considers
‘himself “relaxed and quiet”
off the court, on the court
it is a different story.

“When I step out on the
floor everyone on the
other team is my enemy,”

he said. “I’m a give—a-100-,

percent—type person. I
think I’m very similar to
Orlando [Antigua] because
I’m upbeat and confident. I
like to be active out
there.”

Many players today pat-
tern their games after the

great ones like Jordan,
Magic and Bird just to
name a few. Thomas said
his role model is not even
on the court, but on the
links.

“I look up to my father,”
he says. “He got me to‘

ing golf together for about'

While ‘Thomas is quite
diverse both on and off the

-court, his most notable fea-

tures may very well be his
strong desire to improve
himself and his hunger to
win.

“I’m not the type of per-
son who listens to people
tell me how good I am and
gets to a peak and stops,”
Thomas said. “I like to

Women

Continued from page H-10
had a great career here at Pitt. She’s
only a junior, but you don’t look for
your seniors all the time to be your

leaders. She can be one of the true lead-

ers on this team by stepping it up a
notch in the effort department. When
lteammates]‘see her going all out they
tend to give a maximum effort also.”

Huemrich garnered MVP honors at
both of last season’s regular—season tour-
naments. The six—foot forward earned a
season high of 36 points against
Providence and finished the season an
impressive seventh in the Big East in
scoring and first in ﬁeld-goal percentage
at 52.4 percent.

Colabrese, a small forward and two
guard, will be expected to help
Huemrich with the scoring load. A very
well-rounded player, Colabrese can pen-
etrate inside, rebound and hit the out-
side shot. .

She averaged 9.4 points and 3.3
rebounds per game last season but,
most importantly, hit 75 Percent from
the line — the team’s best percentage.
‘Her consistent, hard-nosed play paid off
with a selection to the 1991-’92 All-Big
East Team.

“Jill made gigantic strides for us last
year,” Bruce commented. “She played in
a Big-East all star team overseas, which
really helped her overall game. Jill has a
lot of skills, is strong and can do a lot of
different things for us.” '

Bruce’s other returning starters should
complement his two all-stars. Center
Carolyn Miller, who blocked a team-
leading 17 shots last year, is expected to
be a strong force on the inside again
this season. Despite the team’s penchant
for the outside shot, the6-foot—3-inch
junior will be expected not only to pull
down her share of rebounds but also to
provide the team with consistent inside
scoring.

“Carolyn’s the kind of girl who is big
and strong and will get the offensive
rebounds for you,” Bruce said. “But if
you’re out there — and this ties in with
our overall philosophy —— we expect
you to take the open jumper when you

- get it. She averaged just under 10 points

last year, and we expect her to exceed
that this season.”

The best all-around athlete and top
defender is 5’10” guard Jill McElhinny.
Bruce’s defensive scheme consisten_tly
calls on the senior to handle the opposi-
tion’s most potent scorer.

“Jill is a special kind of athlete,” Bruce
said. “She gives everything she has for
her coach, for her team and for her uni-
versity. She is shooting the ball very
well so. far this year and she has worked
out [in the weight rooml.’ She has the
great quickness, is very strong, but now
is ready to pick it up scoring-wise.”

The most versatile player on the team,
McElhinny averaged 5.8 points and 4.1
rebounds last year. She was second on
the team with 78 assists and third with
48 steals.

At point guard, Bruce has two strik-
ingly different players who can both add
a valuable dimension to the team. Erin
Maloy, a 5’8” junior, is the best pure
shooter on the team.- Holding records
for most 3-pointers made (73) and
attempted (222), Maloy provides another
sharpshooter on the floor.

Bruce’s other weapon at the point is
sophomore Carol Morton. An outstand-
ing athlete form the West Indies, Morton
is coming off her first year of competi-
tive basketball. She proved herself a true
point guard last season — one who can
run the‘ ﬂoor and distribute the ball to
the open shooters. After Morton’s strong
performance in an offseason summer
league, Bruce said he expects to see
marked improvement in her play.

The Panthers also have the advantage
of a deep and experienced bench. Since
the starting lineup is not quite definite
yet, these players are also potential
starters. The first player off the bench
will most likely be 6’O” senior forward
Turia Ransom, whom Bruce will look to
for a spark. The oft-injured senior has
yet to put together a complete season
and is looking forward to showcasing
the skills that made her an All-Big East
Rookie choice her first year at Pitt.

Another senior who hopes‘ to have an
outstanding final season is 5’8” shooting
guard Lisa Fessler. A nagging knee

injury hindered her performance last
season, but she is now healthy and will
provide leadership and a strong outside
shot. .

Senior Tiffany Fingers also hopes to
bounce back from the injuries that have
hampered her during her first three sea-
sons. The 6’O” forward looks to add
some punch off the pine to the offense.

Jenine Joyce, who missed most of last
year due to medical problems, begins
her-sophomore season with high expec-
tations from Bruce and his staff. The
5’9” guard showed why she was so
highly touted when she led the team
with 17 points, four boards and four
steals in an important tournament win
over Boston College during her first
year. Joyce is a player comparable to Jill
Colabrese, and she possesses a terrific
outside shot.

Julie Fornadel, another sophomore,
played in all 29 games last season and
started in four. The 6’O” forward, accord-
ing to Bruce, is “a banger who is capa-
ble of some offense” and should receive
ample playing time at power forward.

Stephanie Petho and Tressa Bolfert
make up the first-year class of the 1992-
’93 season. The two recruits are
extremely different in approach but
share the same goal: score.

Petho, a 5’8” guard from Bellaire,
Ohio, is a lethal scoring threat from any-
where on the floor. She was named
First-Team UPI and AP All—State with an
average of 35.9 points per game.

Bolfert, on the other hand, is a bruis-
ing inside player. She averaged 20
points and 10.5 rebounds per game as a
senior at Homestead High School in
Mequon, Wisconsin. The 6’1” forward
was named to the All-State team as a
senior and was the Ozaukee County
Player of the Year in both her junior
and senior years. Her presence should
bolster an inside game that is overshad-
owed by the outstanding Iferimeter set.

With big scorers like Huemrich,
Colabrese and McElhinny, the offense
could be therefor Pitt. But the defense
needs to come through if the Panthers
expect to be competitive within the con-
ference over the course of the season.

‘ Midnight Madness.

Unfortunately, Antigua
aggravated the ankle about a
week and a half ago and is
now working himself back
cautiously.

“I think I might have rushed
back too soon,” he said. 3

Antigua wants to practice,
but said that he will take his
time and let the ankle heal
properly so that the injury will
not linger on and jeopardize
his season.

“Once you twist an ankle or
sprain it real bad, the ankle’s
never the same,” he said. “You
have to keep strengthening it,
and it will never be as tight as
it was.”

Jones is back stronger than
before, and the competition
for the small forward job
should be heated. Antigua is
only looking at the situation in
a positive light.

“I think that is a positive for
me, even though my minutes
might decrease,” Antigua said.
“It’s positive in the fact that I
get to play against him every
day in practice, and he’ll help
to enhance my skills from the
three. And also it will motivate
me to get a little stronger, to
play a little more physical with
him ‘cause he’s a lot ‘stronger
than I am, and I’m going to be
running into guys like that in
the future in~=the Big East.

“I wanted to let the coaches
know that I can play, and that
I want to fight for the position.
Antoine’s a tough player and
he’s an excellent athlete and

_ it's gonna be tough. But’ I just

want to keep playing against
him so I can get better and
learn stuff from him — him
being the senior and me being
the sophomore now — that I
didn’t learn last year from
playing against him.”

His fellow sophomore
believes Antigua’s progress
has been nothing short of
amazing and expects the same
this season.

“As far as his game is con-
cerned, I feel he’s developing
faster than anyone else I’ve

~v
iﬁ“

ever seen,” McCullough said. . ,

“He only played one year as a
[forward], and that year was in
the Big East. And he was able
to handle it and make All-
[Rookie], playing a position
which he never playedvbefore
in his life.” ’

While both of these talented
sophomores bear the heavy
burden of lofty expectations in
‘92-’93, Antigua reflected on
their promising beginning and
looked ahead anxiously to
future Big East wars.

“I think it went pretty good.
I think we did a whole lot bet-
ter than many ‘people thought
we were gonna do,” he said of
last season. “And I think we
should have an even better
season this year.

“I think it’ll be more com-
petitive than what the experts
say. I think once we start get-
ting on a roll, we have a lot of
young athletes and a lot of
enthusiasm on the team. And I
think once we get on a roll,
we’ll be all right.” -

not a player in this league
quicker than [McCullough] is.
If Ican just hang with him in
practice, Ithink I'll be all

"Brian Caver, he's nothing
compared to holding Jerry,"
Rhymes said. "It ishard to
hold a person who can drib-
ble end to end in eight sec-
onds."

Another part of basketball is

‘missing more Shots than you

make, and guards who miss
too many shots under Evans
have historically earned his
scorn.

Last year, Shareef averaged
6.1 points‘ in 18 minutes per
game and, in Rhymes’ opin-
ion, became gun shy -— a
trait that Rhymes has no
intention of picking up.

“Everybody misses shots.
You can’t point the finger
because you have a couple of
missed shots,” Rhymes said.
“You gotta take the good
with the bad and take more

)chances._ I think people have

been tentative about taking
the shot, even when they are
open. Where I come from, if
you’re open you take the
shot. That’s my philosophy.

“[Shareet"s] gotta start look-
ing for his shot. I think I can
encourage him to take his
shot \because he’s a good
friend of mine.”

But it wasn’t friendship that
brouglit Rhymes thousands of
miles across the “country to
play hoops. It was the mys-
tique of the Big East
Conference that lured this
tough city kid to Pitt.

dream came true'. Now I
gotta make it happen. .1 gotta

Of course, not only does
Rhymes have to make the
adjustment from JC to major
conference basketball, he has
to adjust to the academic and
urban challenges as well.

"City wise, I'm used to the
city," he said. But I'm not
used to these houses though.
Everything is so cramped. It
also makes me mad becuase
Ihave to walk all the time. I

Rhymes, who was born
and raised in South Phoenix
— one of the roughest parts
of the city. Strangely, he
chose Pitt over Arizona State
University to escape some of
the urban problems on the
Tempe campus.

“My mom told me to stay
out of trouble and just mind
your own,” Rhymes said. “I
was looking at ASU before I
came here. Some of them
were in jail, and that’s what
I'm scared of.”

He credits his mother for
helping him get his priorities
in order and realizing what a
great opportunity playing
basketball at Pitt can be for
him.

“I'm telling myself that I just
got two things to do — get
my education and play good
