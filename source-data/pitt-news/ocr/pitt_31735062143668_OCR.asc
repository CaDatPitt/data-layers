Dr. Taylor Talks
At Math Club

Discussion Monday Will be
on Einstein Theory

Dr. J. S. Taylor, professor of math-
ematics, will discuss “What is Space
of Four Dimensions” at the regular
meeting of the Math club on Monday
afternoon. The room for the meeting
has not been decided on, as yet.

Dr. Taylor, in commenting on the
discussion he will give, says: “The
fact that t‘ne.Ei-nstei-n theory makes
use of a space of four dimensions,
using time for a. fourth coordinate,
has led many to the erron'eous con-
clusion that time is the fourth dimen-
sion. The Einstein Space of four
dimensions is merely one of many.
four-diinentional geometries. Geomet-
rically we may consider a space of
any number of dimensions and in-
terpret the coordinates in a variety
of ways.

“The justiﬁcation for the use of
geometric language in problems of
more than three variables is merely

gests analogies and often leads to
the discovery of relationships that
might otherwise be overlooked. In no
sense do mathematicians claim that
hyper-space has physical reality."

Dr. Taylor's discussion will be an
attempt on his part, to clarify the con-
flicting ideas of the four dimensions.

Dr. Root To Give Talk
On Incidental Training

 

Dr. Vvilllam T. Root, head of the

Conference.

Coed Glee Club
Gives Concert

Preparation Made for An-
nual Home Concert

The Women’s Glee Club presented
another of its series of minor con-
certs of the year at the Presbyterian
church in Homestead Park at 8 o’clock
last evening. The entire club sang
eight songs and Norma Cibula sang
several Czechoslovakian songs in the
country's costume.

cluded: “Serenade,” “Dark Eyes,”
“-Wake Thee Now, Dearest,” “Sleep-
ers Awake,” “Nymphs and Shep-

herds,” “The Nile” and “Whither Go-

cert to be given May 3. This con-
cert will be made up of the regular
numbers that have been sung during
the year and a cantata, “The VVin-
ning of Amarac.” This cantata is a

Ross Stresses Application
Of Bellamy To Present Day

Dr. J. Eliot Ross. who has taught
at the University of Illinois, the Uni-l
versity of Texas, and Columbia Uni-
versity, addressed the Inquiry Forum

Dr. Chester A. Buckner, head of the
division of professional education; Dr.

Second Fine Arts Exhibit
April 10 At Heinz House

 

The Fine Arts department of the
University will give its second exhibit
of the year at the Heinz House on
Monday, April 10, and Tuesday, April
11, under the. direction of Walter
Hovey, professor in the department of
ﬁne arts.

This exhibit will show reproductions
of Oriental prints and paintings, since
the last showing of modernistic re-
productions was of such interest to
Pitt students. More deﬁnite details
for the exhibit will be announced soon.

‘Wednesday afternoon, on “Rereading
Bellamy.”

 Discussing Belli1my's'works"-from a.
comprehensive viewpoint, Dr. Ross re-
viewed their salient features and
stressed particularly their application
to economic and political conditions
of today. He utilized an approach dif-
ferent from that of most Forum
speakers, speaking only ﬁfteen min-
utes and devoting the remainder of
the_hour to questions.

In the informal conversation which
ensued, many aspects of Be1lamy’s
Utopia were brought out. According.
to -the speaker, each person in the
United States would receive, in the
scheme, a sum of credits equivalent
to $2,500. There would be no money,
and consequently no credit nor bank-
ing system.

“The most signiﬁcant part of the
plan," declared Dr. Ross, "is in its in-
ception without the bloodshed of revo-

lutlon nor the injustice of conﬁsca-

tion. Although it would necessarily
do away with private property, the
transition would be gradual."

The lecturer explained in the light
of Bellamy's reasoning how the
change might be accomplished. The

government,‘ he stated, would inrsuch -

a time as this lend’ so much money
to railroads and other public enter-
prises that it would ﬁnally take them
over as government corporations. It
would hire unemployed men to man-
ufacture goods for the government-
employed railroad workers, and would
thus increase its inﬂuence. A huge
bureaucracy would result in which
the state would regulate all produc-
tlon anddistribution.

What appealed most to Dr. Ross
was that Bellamy foresaw trends in
America even’ now developing. That
the nineteenth century author of
“Looking Backward” could see the
government pouring credit into the
railroads, doing away with money by
using scrip, and that he envisaged
technocracy long before Howard

Minor Reévisions Made

 

After a smoke} last night to orient
the new men and to revive alumni
spirit, “All to th‘_e Point” is fast gain-
ing speed, Dire‘c.t.or William Marlatt
declares, and w thin a week will be
running smoothliz The ﬁrst curtain
is scheduled for; Friday night, April
21, and already 1 arrangements for
the. cast, a revised libretto, and
snappy music. 1,787-1933 styles, have
been prepared for the inaugural. Sev-
enty-ﬁve men are now at work in the
cast and the choruses.

The original libretto of G. Norman
Reis is being worked over to suit
temperamental college boys who fret
over girlish lines. The plot revolves
about Miss Melisfsa Marbury, a_ young

the changed lines, Craig Forbes is
still hero and Joe Briggs still the vil-
lain of the show. Marlatt emphasized
that only minor alterations are being
made in the parts, and that the show
will remain essentially the same.

Several minor changes have also
been made in the cast, apparently
after the director found “hidden tal-
ent in the uncut diamonds of the
chorus.” Names of the promoted men
have not been released, pending ﬁnal
tryouts for the roles.

Practice schedules have at last been
prepared, Marlatt breathed thankful-
ly, and cast and chorus are at work
three afternoons and two evenings a
week. As an added feature in the or-
dinary rehearsal routine, Cap and
Govm men, both active and alumni
members, met in the Activities Hut
last night for a smoker.

latt’s charges from the 1933 and pre-
vious shows. New men in the organ-
ization, who this year comprise one-
half the acting body, met the grad-
uate directors of the activity for the
ﬁrst time.

"All to the Point.” has several dis-
tinctions as a student production this
year. It includes the largest cast in
the six years of Marlatt’s supervision,
gives music particular stress, and for
the ﬁrst time within memory, includes
no tap or fancy dancing in the chorus.
Early American Waltzes and minuets
instead will feature the work of the
supporting men and “women”.

Production work has not languislied
in the whirl of ﬁve playing practices
each week. The business staff of
eight men under Victor Matteson,
Eng. '33, and the production group of
eleven under John Grove, Col. ’34.
are working steadily upon “the great‘
est of them all.”

Second Model Set
lNow On Display
In Cathedral

A new model set has been
placed on display by Pitt Players
in the miniature stage in 801 Ca-

thedral of Learning.

This time it is a four-room

apartment built to the scale of

. one inch to one foot, completed
in every detail. The main room
is the parlor of a Chicago suite in
which the two young Minicks and
the Old Man Minlck have their
-three acts full of comedy.

The model was constructed by
Samuel Moyer, Col. '33, out of old
posters and scraps from his moth-
er’s rag-bag. The telephone was
reincarnated from an old door-
stop, the two lamps were once
parts of an old curtain rod and a
monkey wrench.

There is on tl1e.set.a...ti11..3v'_sec-
retary complete to the very paper

with rows of miniature books on
its shelves. Every property es-
sential to the action of the play
is incorporated in the set.

The set is lighted with minia-
ture electrical equipment con-
structed by Robert. K. McConnell.
In lighting the dining room off to
be right he employs a dimmer
made of small wires wound
around a circulaimcandy box. The
lighting on this set is more com-
plete, and the electrical units
more adequate than will be used
on the actual set.

Moyer intends to enter his set
in the name of the Pitt Players
in the Drama League contest
which will be held as an exhibi-
tion a.t a downtown department
store during Easter vacation. A
prize of twenty-ﬁve dollars will
be awarded for the best set.

Women To Study 0
Vacation Needs

Find Coed Preferences,
Preparation

The survey committee of VVSGA,
under the chairmanship of Phyllis
Cook, is now engaged in making an
extensive investigation of employ
ment needs and preferences of Pitt
women. Miss Mary V. Louden, in-
structor in psychology, is adviser to
the group in conjunction with Miss
Thyrsa' VV. Amos, dean of women.
Miss Louden, in speaking of the pur-
pose of the group, says:

“The survey committee is interested
i-n studying the versatility of Pitt
senior women with reference to their
prospects for employment in these

very unusual times. The point of
_ The ﬁrst
point is to focus the attention of the
student on the wisdom of preparing
to ﬁt into more than one niche; the
second is to discover what further
guidance Pitt can give its women
toward better vocational adjustment.”

The ‘committee has composed a
questionnaire, which they are trying
out ﬁrst on committee members, in
order to get a basis on which to
further their investigation of the em-
ployment difﬁculties of Pitt women.

The questionnaire asks the following
questions: “How many women must
work? How many don’t have to
work? How many are not in need of
employment and yet would like to
secure a position? How many have
no desire to get employment?

 During the survey committee meet-
'ing next 'Tuesday‘the~.fe’11‘owing anem-
bers of the committee will receive the

Car Strikes Tree Below
Drive Intersection

Two University students were in-
jured yesterday morning when a car
driven by Josephine Savage, Col. ’36,
got beyond control and crashed into
a tree at the intersection of Univer-
sity Drive and Parkman Boulevard.
below State Hall.

The injured were Jane Booth, Col.
’36, an occupant of the car, and Allan
Gueder, Eng. ’33, who was walking
along Parkman Boulevard at the time
the car failed to make the turn at the
iut,ersectio.n..'.Miss Booth was treated
for minor scratches and shock by Dr.
Auleene M. Jamison at women’s
health service in Alumni Hall and
was able to return to her classes.

Gueder, caught between the car and
the tree, suffered painful abrasions
and contusions of the left knee, ac-
cording to Dr. H. C. Carlson, who
gave him medical attention at the
men’s health service in the Fall:
Clinic. He was removed to his home
and is expected to be fully recovered
within a few days. Miss Savage, who
lost control of her car while trying to
close a door which had sprung open,
escaped the accident without injury.

Health Service Presents
Program For Proper Diet

From‘ the 'ofﬂce‘ of the ' Stuclent
comes a few hints to the students on
proper diet.

The program essays to present a
simple outline of the fundamental
principles underlying the selection of
a normal diet which would be of
most value. The main point stressed
is that an adequacy of all of the
materials necessary should be con-
tained in the normal diet. If such a
dietary regime is carried out, results
of nutritional. failure will be avoided,
androbust health enjoye.d..~- 

In order to meet the require ent,s.i
of the normal diet, the following pro-
tective foodstuffs should form the
foundation of the daily diet: A One
quart of milk. one to two’ eggs, one
tablespoonful of butter, two servings
of fruits, one of which should be raw,

 

‘three _large servings of vegetables
‘(not including the potato), of which
one should be green and leafy, one
serving of meat, ﬁsh or fowl. To this
list any other reasonable food stuff
may be added to satisfy the appetite.

The normal diet should contain:
Adequate food units or calories to
maintain the individual under the de-
sired activities; adequate proteins to
build and repair body tissues, ade-
quate fats and carbohydrates to serve
as fuel for production of energy, ade-
quate vitamins to encourage growth
of the body and to prevent disease,
adequate minerals to build and rein-
force body structures and to regulate
the acidity and alkalinity of the in-
ternal body ﬂuids, adequate ﬂuids to
preserve the life of all tissues, and
adequate roughage to supply vitamins

and to regulate bowel activity.

Three Groups
Here Monday

Students Hear Educator at
10:30, Faculty. Forum
at 4 o’clock

Third Hour Is Cut,

An outstanding educator, a well
known lecturer, and a prominent
writer is Dr. Charles W. Gilkey, who.
is to speak at a special student as-
sembly at Memorial Hall Monday
morning at 10:30 o’clock. The third
hour is to be dispensed with in order
to allow University students to hear
the dean of the University of Chicago
speak on “Education and the Im-
ponderables.”

‘ “Clear, lucid. and forceful” is the
description of the man’s style by vari-

ous administrative oﬁlcers and fac-
ulty members who have heard Gilkey.
“No better tribute can be paid to any
man,” according up W. VV. Menden-
hall, secretary of the YMCA, “than
that Dean Gilkey knows what he
wants to say, and then he says it."

After talking at the student assem-
bly, Gilkey is to have two more speak-
ing engagements for Monday. At.
12:30, he is to address a joint session
of the YM, and YWCA at the Heinz
House. The affair is to be open to
any student on the campus who de-
sires to attend. At 4 o’clock the doc-
tor is to speak at the ﬁrst of the meet-
ings of the Faculty Forums on Char-
acter, also at Heinz House.

A graduate of Harvard, Dr. Gilkey
has spent nearly all his life travelling
to see how students the world over
react to political and social problems.
He has taken graduate work at the
University of Berlin, Oxford and Edin-
burgh. Yale, Harvard, and Brown
have conferred honorary degrees upon
him.

Dr. Gilkey has distinguished him-
self as a theologian, being selected as
the most representative minister in
America in 1924. That same year he
was commissioned to deliver the Bar-
rows lectures in India. In addition,
he has preached at Harvard, Yale,

Princeton, Cornell, and the University

of Toronto.

Among the books he has written
are: “New Frontiers for Faith;"
“Present Day Dilemmas in Religion;"
and “Jesus and the New Generation.”

The faculty forums are sponsored
annually by faculty members who are

interested in fostering the proper
pedagogic attitudes among them.-
selves. They form themselves. into a. .

committee, make arrangements for
the meetings, and then proceed to ob-
tain outstanding speakers. Originally,
Gilkey was scheduled to speak at the
faculty meeting only, but it was de-
cided to give students an opportunity
to hear him also.

By their own statement, the purpose
of these meetings is “to afford inter-
ested faculty members and adminis-
trative oiﬁcers an opportunity to con-
sider how they may help the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh become more con-
ducive to adequate spiritual and char-
acter growth.”

The subject for discussion at the
faculty meeting is "The Fundamental
Issues.” Dr. Lee Paul Sieg, dean of
the College and Graduate School, is
to preside at this meeting with dis-
cussion being led by Dr. William T.
Root, head of the department of
psychology.

Other meetings are to be conducted
April 12 when Dr. Robert C. Clothier,
president of Rutgers University and
former dean of men here,_ discusses
“Administrative Responsibility and
Limitations” and on April 18 when Dr.
S. P. Franklin, professor of religion
ahd religious education, speaks on
“Our Problems.”

E. A. Holbrook, dean of the Schools
of Engineering and Mines, is to pre-
side at the second meeting, and Miss
Thyrsa VV. Amos, dean of women, is
to lead discussion. The last meeting

W
M. A. Devitis, azssociate pi-ofessor
of n1_odern," languages, together with
Do,r.ot11iy'To1:1'eyson, instructor in mod-
ern languages, has written three
books in Spanish, which are now in
press. '  _
“l\{arraciones de la America Espan-
ol'a,’.' a collection of legends, .trad_i-,

tions, anecdotes .and_ poems dealing ;

with the m°n'eteen Spanish-speaking
c,oun_tries, of America. has been gath-
ered and written by the two teachers.

"All the material in this book has
been gathered from original sources
and rewritten to suit the needs of}
students at the end of their first yeari
in Spanish,” said Mr. DeVitis. “The
stories themselves are unknown to the
United States reading public. A story
and poem gathered from each country
will be illustrated by photographs
taken and given to the author by gov-
ernment ofﬁcials‘-and interested men
in the different countries."

The ﬁnal draft of the book was
completed’ while Mr. DeVitis was in
Mexico City for six weeks during the
summer of 1928. There the Mexican
poet, Rafael Valli, went over the
manuscript.

Macmillaii and Company has an-
nounced the book to be ready for use
by this coming September. A com-
pletely Spanish edition of the book.
with the English notes extracted will
be ptit out__a_.t a later date to be cir-
cu.late_d “ in these Spanish ~ spec-king
Auieric-a.n countries. '

“A Collection of Twelve Modern
Spanish Stories”. has been compiled
and edited by, Mr. DeVitis and will
also be‘ ready"or_ use in ‘September.
Including’ introduction, notes, exer-
cises and vocabularies. this book will
be published by the Century Co., and
will be for the use of intermediate stu-
dents in Spanish.

The third book. also for interme-
diate students, edited by Mr. DeVitis
and Miss 'l‘orreys'or1 and published by
I\’l2tL'.IVIillall, is announced ‘for some
time in 1934. It is aclassroom edition
of one of the most famous Spanish
novels of the nineteenth century and
one most widely known in .forei.gn
languages, “Pepita Kimcnez," by Juan

- The story, deals with a._ young man’.s
conflict in ‘studying for the priest-
hood, his struggles bet;.wee_n_ devotion
to his profession-a11d his earthly love
for the heroine.

 Discuss YWCA Program

At Sports Unit Meeting

   

The regular weekly n1ectin,<:' of tlic
Fresh Sports Unit took place Thurs-
day at 12:30 o'clock in Heinz House.

The méllioi‘ D01'ti0n of the discussion
cent.ered around the YVVCA program,
to take place April 7. Included anrlong
the contributors are the freshman
units. ,

\\'hen you come to think of it, it
does scent strz111_9.‘e iliut none of the
boxers who fouglit i11 the Cont'e1‘c11ce
cl1z11npionsl1ips at 1\i_o1'g:ant.ow11 were
given 21. medical exuminz1l;io11 before
911116-.1'l11g the ring. This is one thing
that should have never been over-

looked, but accide11t can happen, and

likely will.

The story that was recently pub-
lished about the basketball manager
who had to wash the teams’ socks
once because he was too late for the
laundry has been changed. It wasn't
once, it was twice.

And there seems to be a soinewhat
persistent rnnior that the basketball
team will take another tour of the
coast in the very near filture. If so,
lets hope that the result isn’t the same
as the last: trip’s.

A look at the football roster, as it
in the dressing room, would
seem to indicate quite plainly that the
Pitt team of next year will be the
“beefiest” in Pitt history. Brains to
direct the beef will not be lacking
by any means.‘

Itfs rez1ll}_' about time that another
college song" was eopyrigmed and be-
It. seems wrong

cntliusiastic collegian, who never 211;-
tended college,'breaking out into :1
song rash. Maybe it"s better that
there are no collegiate somxs 011 the
air."

Amateur boxers are supposedly bet-

ter" than the average run of college
mittmen, and this maxim will get a
fine test when Jack Schricker and
Jimmy Gianhatti ‘meet some of the
boys in the AMA tournament at the
Keystone. '
‘ Incidentally Giannatti is ﬁghting un-
der the colors of the Sands A. C'., 21
Uniont.own slug; club where he learned
most of the tricks of the trade.

And. one bad thing, about winning
in such a tournament is the fact that
the winner must fight two or three
times each evening _un_ti|-‘ he either
wins the championship or is carried
out on a stretcher.

If you keep praising and writing

about an athlete, he eventually gets‘

the idea that’ he really is the Iii}?
bin and, is ‘invincible. Wliiclrgoes to
show tliat the Bizad Students are still
1ioping"fo1~ 3’ wrestling star to come
a.lo1'1g.

The wrestling team must be con-
sidering. the scheduling of another
match, as the boys arestill working
out each day’. incidentally the team
looks much improved and the boys
are liable to come through any time.
l_-iubler is working for the good of the
squad,_ if, you take the trouble to ask
the members.

And a nicknznne tlr.1t really de-
serves honorable mention is “'I‘ra.('.ler
liorii,” with the accent on the Horn.
Wliicli reminds me that the swimming
team and rifle team n1e1nbers have
not yet receivecl their official nick-
names.-

Our Last Rites

 

 

HANCELLOR BOWMAN'S de-
cision to make the June com-
mencement address his own Der-
?» sonali message to ‘the "graduating
class comes as a welcome sur-

prise to those of us who will be
' appearing that day for the last
time as undergraduates.

There will be a little less of the
feeling of the “forgotten man”
prevalent in the Stadium June 7
as a result of this annoiincement.
The Chancel1or’s presence on the
speakers’ platform will counter-
balance to some extent the feel-
ing of relative unimportance that
will be ‘experiencedby--every se-
nior as he rises with several hun-
dred of his classmates to receive
his degree. So-called mass educa-
tion in institutions of higher
learning has necessitated the
practice of conferring degrees “en
masse."

We are glad that there is to be
a commencement message from
one who is more than a little con-
cerned over the future of each in-
dividual in the graduating class.
This is hardly the time to hear
the familiar platitudes of a pro-

fessional optimist representing;
another institution or a business
enterprise.

The Chancellor has said that he
is’ ain"‘:i‘o’ii's “‘to"‘i.a1k to the “0u'tgo’ing
class about the conditions they
will have t.o face after graduation.
Again we are glad he has some-
thing to say about our futures
which is too personal and import-
ant to pass on to another.

The announcement would have
even greater signiﬁcance for the
entire student body if. from this

A ‘New’ Scholarship

 

HE Business Administration
Alumni Association has cre-
ated a ﬁtting memorial to the late
Dr. Howard C. Kidd The mem-
bers voted last week to change
the name of their annual scholar-
ship award, giving it the name of
their former colleague. Thus the
Business Administration Alumni
Association award becomes. the
Howard Carson Kidd Scholarship.
Each year a junior in the school
of Business Administration rc-
ceives the asso-ciation’s award of
fifty dollars. It is understood
that, under the new name, this
amount is to be increased.

The scholarship committee, in
recommending the change, urged
that the scholarship “be devoted
annually to developing the type of
men of whom Howard Carson
Kidd would have been prouc.”
With adherence to that standard
in the selection of future candi-
dates, the scholarship can not fail
to fulﬁll its purpose and be a
credit to the name of the sponsor-

». izig organization.

Howard C. Kidd, scholar and
friend of scholars, would have been
the first to have suggested such a
memorial for another, were he
alive today. No more ﬁtting form
to perpetuate his memory for fu-
lure underg1'a(lua.tes could :1-ave
been proposed by his former asso-
ciates.

senior in the Engineering School, and
presenting him with an award.

The success of the two Engineering
dances this year has placed the As-
sociation in a position to carry
through this project, a project that
was conceived last year but which
was dropped because of lack of funds.

William Johnson, ChE. ’33,,_is chair-
man, and has on his committee: R.
D. VVashington, EE '33; H. G. Ander-
son, ME '33; Kenneth Steele, IE ’34;
and Harold Mahoney, ChE '34. These
men will present to the Association,
some time next week, recommenda-
tions as to the type of award to give

and also methods for choosing the
recipient.

Contemporary Art Group Exhibits

Charles E, McCurdy’s facility for
organizing exhibitions has given us
the second exhibition this year of the
Contemporary Art Center. The exhi-
bition opened last Thursday on the
ground ﬂoor of the Union Trust Bulld-
ing, where the paintings of ten
younger artists of the city are being
shown until tomorrow. In every re-
spect, it ‘is the most interesting show
since the Associated, and though
much smaller, represents a more dis-
tinguished choice and, as a whole, a
quality of work considerably higher
than the average note of the Carnegie
Show. The artists are still young;
some are obviously trying to ﬁnd
tl1e1nselves—-we trike this for granted.
The important fact is that their work
demonstrates an individual energy,
and an intelligent, earnest approach
that always carries some measure of
virtue.

Marcella Comes, a past Associated
prize winner, has three oil paintings
in the group. Her Pennsylvania
Sturgeon is a curious, cocktail stunt
in bright paints, labels, and glued-on
cigarette butts and match folders. It
is humorously intended, despite the
fact that some people were much puz-
zled "oh seeing it“and El. few ready=to
hail the appearance of a new school
of painting. The Nude is quite ordi-
nary, with nice ﬂesh tones. Her best
piece is Vittoria, a portrait of a.
woman done in subdued, rich colors
with a certain Mediterranean warmth
about it.

Charles E. Mccnrdy has two re-
cently-completed Wylie Avenue
Sketches, both with a sound handling
of composition, McCurdy’s color is
especially ﬁne, growing out of a pre-
dominance of deep Vermilion walls
and houses. The one marked Opus 2
has real strength in it. McCurdy does
capture some of the Pittsburgh atmos-
phere.

We get another breath of Pitts-
burgh in Louise Pershing’s study of
steel mills and river, called Pitts-
burgh, and also in Mary Shaw Maro-
l1onic’s View of Pittsburgh from Craf-
ton. Louise Pershing’s is much su-
perior. Vvith an ordinary scene of
long mills, countless stacks, and the
yellow, rugged river she has shaped
a symmetry and oneness of effect that
proves the possibility of such mate-
rial. The fault in Mary Shaw Maro-
honic’s painting seems to be a. weak
use of color, bordering on sentimen-
tality. The Old Style Boquet has
much the same quality about it,
though her study of a thrashing ma-
chine, called Modern Dinosaur, is bet-
ter.

Sam Filner’s three studies are ex-
cellent. All three are rather small
but distinguished in draughtsmanship
a.nd*a1)D€&1-'* Julie,‘ an arresting head
in pencil, and Bashful Boy will delight
almost anyone.

Professor Henry Scott of the Uni-
versity Fine Arts Department has
several studies on. exhibition. also.
The portraits are exact, though the
sketches, Reclining Nude and Nude
Study are of more interest and merit.

The other members of the group
who exhibited are Blossom Lomax,
with two convincing experiments in
composition and color; June Groff, an
artist who has been lately doing work
in New York, and who has a. strong
portrait of a. negro culled Portrait of
Charles; Henry Moeser, who 'has
three works included. Three amus-
ing -caricatures by Arthur Grogin are
well worth seeing——-they are His Royal
Highness, Prince of Wales, Hitler, and
George Seibel.

Westinghouse Engineer
Delivers Paper Tuesday

Morris Stone of the Vvestinghouse
Electric and Manufacturing Company
will present a paper on “The Torsion
Problem" at _the Mathematical Collo-
quium, in 104 Alumni at 3:30 Tuesday
afternoon, April 4.

Mr. Stone will discuss a new method
of solving torsion problems by means
of electrical analogies. This problem
in mechanics offers serious difficul-
ties for all but the simplest types of
boundaries. For many engineering
problems in which sections with key-
ways and other irretzular shapes are
involved the soap ﬁlm method has
been practically the only method
available for solution of ‘the problem.

Professor Johnson Talks
On National Resources

 

Prof. Roswell H. Johnson, head of
the department of oil and gas pro-
duction, lectured on the preservation
of natural resources in the United
States at the monthly meeting of
Qnax, Honorary Science fraternity» for
women, which took place at the Uni-
versity cafeteria last Thursday.

Dr, Johnson's speech enveloped all
phases of conservation. He also pre-
sented his personal views in regard
to stopping wasteful practices. After
his talk, all those present were per-
mitted to ask questions pertaining to
the subject and to contribute any-
thing further bearing upon this topic.

Emmy Lou Haller, Eng. '33, prgsj-
dent, presented the speaker.

“Rays ” Makes Appearance ,

 

Dental Quarterly Becomes Literary with a Vengeance.
But Laments Passing of “winchellite” Soundings

 

By B. E. Smyers
Dental R.a:_vs appears today to compete for :1 place among the
more literary contributions of the University campus, in issuing a
proclaniation from the desks of the board of inanagers that no
longer will they accept for publication “the usual type of unim-
portant, irrevelant, useless, and inconsequential drivel as copy for.

‘Class News ’ : ’ ’

and, that steps being‘ more ﬁrmly taken, herald the

passing of “Inﬁrmar_v Inanities,"’ one of the mag’s well known

(among the dental
friends of the editor) “Winche1lite”
soundings which has carried on
through “thick and deep" for the past
two years.

So that the la.mentations of the
“back office” boys on the decrease of
the column, of their ..Rays contribu-
tions may not be too loudly heard, the
editor has taken unto himself a chief
aide to dignity a. former humorous de-
pariment of the Dental quarterly by
quoting Anatole France, then becom-
ing quite “toothy."

From leprosy to tuberculosis is the
scope of the more serious contribu-
tions of the third issue of the present
volume of the Dental quarterly. Dr.
Thomas McBride, a member of the
fa.c.ulty, calls to mind appearances of
the “great disease,” as leprosy was
called in Biblical times, in odd times

=di.1ring the various stages of the
growth of civilization, pointing out
that means of preventing the spread
of the... dread disease
through isolation, the only known
cure until recently.

"Once a leper, always a leper;
shunned and isolated, the unfortu-
nates had no hope whatever. The
status of the 1epers_was.that of out-
casts: they were forced . to """ carry
horns or wear bells to warn the peo-
ple of their approach. Living apart
from the rest of the community they
were, in turn, greatly piticd and
greatly scorned."

W'ith modern metliods-, altliough
isolation -continues, Dr. McBride re-
veals ill-at the use of an oil from the
seed of an East Indian tree seems to
render lepers bacteriologlcally nega-
tive. “In many cases the drug can
accomplish in a short time what gen-
eral measures may-affect only in
months and years. The discovery of
this oil,” concludes Dr. McB1'ide_, “is
a remarkable victory for man in his
battle with the microbes.”

Tliere is no method of identiﬁcation
be-lieves Dr. !S. A. Styers, in his
article on “Teeth in Identiﬁcation”
that is entirely certain and foolproof,
but writes that the teeth afford one
of the most splendid methods of iden-
tification, pointing to criminal cases
on record where teeth provided the
final identification of differences.

“The most recent and best known
example of this is the Lindbergh case,
the number and formation of the
teeth being one of the chief means of
identiﬁcation of the- baby.”

Dr. Styers argues that dentists
should be willing to keep a shelf rec-
ord of models and records of their
cases if by doing so, sometime dur-
ing practice, they could save just
one innocent person from the gallows.

Encouraging information is ‘given in
an article on "Tuberculosis in Penn-
sylvania: that while this “white
plague” kills more persons between
the ages of 15 a.nd 45 than any other
disease, its gradual decline in this
state is heartening. In 1930 the
death rate was 58.3 per 100,000 per-
sons, the lowest ever experienced dur-
ing the past 26 years of registration.
Further, during the same period the
disease has been relegated from the
first to the sixth leading cause of
death in the state.

It is pointed out, however, that in-
berculosis in Pennsylvania. continues
ta be a. .g;~ave_ disease. In active form
it is being found in practically ever)’
community, and people are dying
each year in numbers equal to the
population of many important towns
in the state, it being estimated that
one of every ﬁve who dies between
the ages of 15 and 45, dies of tuber-
culosis: in women, one in every three
who die between the ages of 15 and
‘30. ' ' ‘ C
“When this disease takes more than
85,000 lives each year in this coun-
try, and kills more children under 21
than any other communicable disease,
there can be no curtailment of the
safeguards that have been built. up
against the disease: rather, the lines
would be further strengthened and
effective efforts put. forth in order
that the gains may be held.” is the
concluding warning of this timely ar-
ticle. 4‘  " ‘ "
But that the dents become too sub-
merged in seriousness of their liter-

l
l

l

ary efforts, the alumni department
proceeds to unearth some anecdotes
for publication, now in the archives
of “famous troublemakers” which
caused many discomforts on the part
of the “perpetrated" among those
now outside the walls of the inﬁr-
mary.

_ Between the ridiculous and the sub-
lime of the current edition of the
Rays ‘is’ sandwiched a warning‘ to fu-
ture dentists that “there is no_evi-
dence of any therapeutic value’ In a
dentifrice over common salt sprinkled
on the brush, but that a good den-
trifice is convenient and pleasant and
thus encourages cleanliness,” to bring
the sum total of the “notes, notices.
and nonentities" of the third issue of
the eighth volume of Dental Rays to

and gold colored covers of the dental

Big Bluff?

University of 'Wasl1ington profcs-5

siors go on record as saying that bluff-
ing is all right just as long as the
bluffer does not get caught. They
say that “A” students make the best
‘blu-fliers because they have nerve
enough to stall, and that students
may just as well learn to bluff in col-
lege since they will have to bluff

sooner or later in life.

Why Weight?

Breaking traditions is getting
to be quite a fad these days, even
among college students. The
clock in Dartmouth hall had
never been stopped since its in-
stallation in 1769 until recently
when a couple of students stole
the 72-pound pendulum. They
were pursued by police for sev-
eral blocks, and, when last heard
from, they were, unlike the clock,
still running.

Attendance at every football game,
