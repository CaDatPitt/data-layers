Third In Nation

Philosophy Excels

by SUE RUFFNER

In a recent survey taken by the
American Council on Education
(ACE). Pitt's graduate philoso-
phy program was tied with Michi-
gan as the third best in the nation:
the graduate faculty was rated
fourth.

The honors did not truly sur-
prise people in the department.
said Dr. Gerald Massey. depart-
ment chairman. “We strove to
form the best philosophy depart-
ment and everything else. includ-
ing the ACE ratings just followed.

Dr. Massey believes the de-
partment began to improve no-
ticeably about eight years ago
when Dr. Kurt Baier was chair-
man.

“A critical mass of excellent
professors began to form during
1962-63,” said Dr. Massey.
“Wilfred Sellers, Nuel Belnap
and Nicholas Rescher joined the
department during this period.
They, as first-rated faculty mem-
bers, attracted other very able
people.”

In addition to this "critical
mass of excellent professors“ in
the graduate program. the depart-
ment also boasts a fine junior

Calling his "involvement in
making changes to improve the
University qualitatively. in im-
proving communications between
students and the administration.
and in solving some of the critical
problems that have plagued this
and other universities“ a “source
of satisfaction." Jack Freeman.
executive assistant chancellor.
talked about his “very busy“
three and one-half years at Pitt
and expressed hopes for his future
as president of the Johnstown
campus.

"This job has involved a lot."
Freeman explained. "It has been
primarily that of a facilitator-to
facilitate the role of the Chancel-
lor. who is an incredibly busy
man. It has involved facilitating
communications both to and- from
the Chancellor and problem solv-
ing of all kinds."

Freeman has served as media-
tor in many disputes here. often
presenting the views of the (‘han-
cellor.

“It's been exciting, never dull,“
he reflected. “When I first arriv-
ed—it was during a period of un-
rest—there was a lot of student
activity; more students were get-
ting involved and becoming con-
cerned, especially with the needs
of minority groups and the com-
munity.”

(foncerning demonstration.
Freeman commented. “'l‘here are
certain issues that large institu-
tions will take action on only after
a group gains their attention.
Demonstrations which call atten-

’tion to serious problems—legiti-‘

yrnate'issues——are valuable.

faculty. "Both groups have ex-
ceptional versatility.“ said Dr.
Massey.

Despite the high ranking. Dr.
Massey maintains that there is
room for improvement. He sees
the topics of ethics. political phil-
osophy and ancient philosophy as
areas that could be strengthened.
“They are already strong al-
though we would like to do some-
thing dramatic to improve them
further."

problems. but can‘t in themselves
change anything.“

In concluding, he stated,
“Changes come about as the re-
sult of good organization for
change, with rational, well-con-h
ceived argumentation — but only
when change is necessary.”

Stating that “few administra-
tors in this country are as pro-
gressive or as enlightened as Dr.
Posvar." Freeman said of the
Chancellor. “I think he's a hell of
a guy.

Turning to the duties that he
will assume July 1 as president of
Pitt’s largest branch campus, he
declared, “My immediate respon-
siblility as president will be to
work with the faculty» and admin-
istration here and there to define
where the Johnstown campus is

Dr. Massey speculated that the
effect of the departments high
rating will be an increased
amount of attention it will re-
ceive by potential graduate stu-
dents. Last year the department
received 350 inquiries and 160
submitted applications. As a re-
sult of the survey, more applica-
tions are expected this year. How-
ever, the increased attention will
not change the number of grad
students accepted, which is about
l7ayear.

Dr. Massey added that the ACE
survey cannot be taken as base
fact. "The problem with the rat-
ing of college graduate programs
is the same as the rating of col-
lege football teams—-the surveys
are a close estimate of a national
rank. but there is no way to pick
a ‘number one.”

The chairman added a final
point about the philosophy de-
partments success. He stated.
“It should be noted that the Uni-
versity's backing of our program
has been strong and loyal. but
judicious.. Our department has
not been inordinately favored. The
University has. however. support-
ed what it thought were sound and
reasonable proposals."

Career

going. I am very much stimulated
by the prospects at Johnstown.”

He went on to say. “I will have
the opportunity to work in plan-
ning and developing programs

. there. The campus offers an ideal

setting for development of pro-
grams in certain areas. such as
ecology and conservation.“

Johnstown now offers a four-
year program in certain depart-
ments of the School of Education.
Freeman revealed that next fall a
four-year engineering technology
program. now in the planning
stages. will be instituted there.

Freeman holds B.A. and M.A.
degrees from Baylor University
in Texas. He has taught at the U.S.

An administrative effort to
bring to light the gripes of the stu-
dents by Assistant Chancellorfor
Student Affairs Bernard Kobosky
netted only 15 students in the SU
Supper Room last Wednesday.

The supposed problem of stu-
dent refunds from the Bookstore
was voiced’ by Marc Hiller.

“last year. students were in-
structed by the Bookstore to save
all book receipts." stated Hiller.
“In the case of a profit students
would receive a small refund.

“I have evidence,” he contin-
ued, “that last year the Book-
store made a profit of $26,000.
Where were our refunds?”

Alluding to the high Bookstore
prices. Dennis Concilla said that
students weren't being charged
low rates. He charged that the
Oakland Co-op continually under-
sold the Bookstore on virtually
every selection.

Kobosky promised an immedi-
ate investigation into “not only
the refund and price situations.
but the matter of the continually
changing reading lists.“

F AS To Discuss J
New Curriculum}

by CAROLE COVAL
The fate of the new freshman

‘curriculum proposal, the Prologue

Program, will be decided this
Saturday at 9 a.m. in Clapp Hall
L9 auditorium when the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences (FAS) con-
venes to debate the pros and cons.

Already receiving much criti-
cism on certain sections, the Pro-
logue Program is due for inten-
sive scrutiny. Interested students
have been invited to attend.

The main proponent of the pro-
gram is Dr. Jerome Schneewind.
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences. Under his impetus. the
College of Arts and Sciences
Council (CASC) spearheaded an
inquiry into the various avenues
to follow to “enlarge the concept.
of learning for the entire College.“

One of the primary directions
was to revise freshman education
in such a way as to provide
“freedom for significant learn-
ing.” From this criterion, the
Prologue Program emerged.

In January of 1970. the Arts and
Sciences Review Committee is-
sued the Interim Report which
outlined and described a new
structure for freshman curricul-
um. After some minor rewording.
the CASC issued the final draft
of the Prologue Program which
will be pursued on Saturday.

The program now needs the ap-
proval of the FAS in order to be-
come a reality. Acceptance by
the FAS is not guaranteed. how-
ever.

Several criticisms have been

credit for the band if it remains
in its all male status."

A statement by Dennis Concilla
that he knew several students

‘forced out of some Black Studies

courses due to their skin color,
and a confession by Marc Hiller
that he had closed out of a psy-
chology course for the same rea-
son, unearthed a small segment
of the racial discrimination prob-
lem at the University.

An obviously startled Kobosky
asked for further details on the
matter as soon as Concilla could
get the numbers of the alleged
discriminatory courses.

Concilla refocused the group by

Debate  

Pitt.” In his public letter to the
administration of Jan. 5, he sees
the program as “not a fuse that
would burn us slowly toward a fiz-
zle in mediocrity; it is a detona-
tor.”

He believes that. by allowing a

‘“non—learning" situation to occur

at Pitt. its academic credentials
would be of little value. and would
be unable to attract high caliber
scholars.

Professor Chapman is not in-
sensitive to the dilemma present-
ed by changing curriculum to en-
large the concept oflearning. He
does feel, however.”'that these
small groups with no structural
considerations will eventually
evolve into sensitivity groups,
“accomplishing only a faint shad-
ow of education."

“The need for increased career
information and guidance is evi-
dent, but for 30 credits and a
whole year? The seminar is an ex-
cellent way of introducing stu-
dents to a particular field,” he
concluded.

Regardless of the projected
“bugs" in the Prologue Program,
Dean Schneewind believes that
this kind of renovation. or liber-
alization in education should pro-
voke the interest it deserves.

asking Kobosky why "the Univer-
sity is receiving a 10 per cent
kick back on insurance and a sev-
en per cent kickback from the
University Travel Service."

“The matter will be looked into
promptly,” replied Kobosky.

Hiller's next target was the
Student Health Center. He stated
that “Dr. Joseph Hinchcliffe re-
fuses to dispense condoms be-
cause his state funds may be cut
as a result.“

In addition to this. Hiller went
on to state that there wasa two
month waiting time for gynecolog-
ical service available to students
via the Health Service. This
means that any possible abortions
would be seriously delayed.

In answer to Hiller’s questions,
Kobosky mentioned that the Uni-
versity position on abortions is
“still a bit shaky,” and that he
will research the apparent with-
holding of contraceptives.

The lack of student participa-
tion in the decision making func-
tions of the Board of Trustees
was brought out by Lenny Klavon-
ic. "Students are needed on the
Boards sub-committees to take
part in its actual functions: to just
sit in on a Board meeting accom-
plishes nothing.“ Klavonic con-
cluded. ’

Though agreeing about the ini-
tial concern of the lack of com-
munication. Kobosky was not def-
inite about the feasibility of stu-
dent seats on the Board’s sub-
committees. He did. however.
agree to provide at least one hope-
fully effective link with the ad-
ministration. by getting the Stu-
dent Development Office. run by
Dr. Charles Montgomery. togeth-
er with the students.

Still another crisis, the parking
situation, was illuminated by an
unidentified student participat-
ing in the discussion. “Students
will not be able to park their cars
in Panther Hollow,” he explained,
“as the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-
road Police would start tagging
and towing them away.”

i Once again, Kobosky could only
promise to contact proper author-
ities to investigate the matter.

Education Advances

by SUE HOENSTINE

Thirty Teacher Corps interns
from Pitt are presently becoming
sensitized to the needs of socially
disadvantaged students in six
Pittsburgh elementary and junior
high schools.

According to Director Dr. Mar-
ion Poole. "Teacher Corps interns
are bringing a fresh approach to
education and are able to offer
educational services usually un-

available to children in disad-
vantaged areas.
Liberal arts graduates who

plan to teach in the inner city, the
Deep South, Appalachia, or the
Southwest are chosen for the
federally funded program and
screened by members of the com-
munity where they will «intern.
During their extended internship
of two years, Teacher Corps par-
ticipants are slowly given in-
creasing teaching responsibil-
ities as they progress from tutor-
ing assignments to full classroom
responsibilities.

Teacher Corps interns are also
required to complete about eight
credits each term at Pitt and
leave the program with a Mas-
ter of Arts degree in teaching.

Poole explained that interns
are encouraged to change meth-
ods of teaching that have not been
successful. "The interns‘ innova-
tions ruboff in helping their stu-
dents become more creative and
open." he said. "Traditionally you
try to make everyone successful
in everything. but people do have
the right to fail. Interns are en-
couraged to plan their changes

Likes Longhairs

logically. and if they fail. they
try something else."

An instructional consultant at-
tends each teaching site daily and

‘acts as what Poole termed “a

change agent” for each group of
five interns. According to Bill
Lusain, an intern who will com-
plete the program in April, “The
instructional consultants really
have expertise in their areas.
They help the intern adjust and
notice the mistakes he’s* made,
and they act as a go-between for
interns, the University, the prin-
cipal, and the faculty.”

Tim Barner. an intern who
plans to continue teaching in the
inner city. feels "the instruction-
al consultants have helped me
gain perspectives on students that
I couldn‘t have gotten alone.“

Poole described the interns in
the following terms. "Teacher
Corps interns are usually highly
idealistic individuals. and their
idealism is sometimes dampened
by actual problems with the bu-
reaucracy. the school system.
the School of Education. and in the
classroom. Many successfully
overcome these problems. and we
encourage interns to keep trying.“

Ann Polonus, who joined the
Corps after teaching for three
years, has found the experience
to be an invaluable means of re-
evaluating her teaching. She stat-
ed, “The only changes we’re going
to make are small ones, but the
Teacher Corps is valuable in ad-
vancing education.”

Community involvement is en-
couraged. and in the past. interns

have provided tutoring services
to the community and assisted in
community projects.

"We've asked interns to live
near the communities where
they‘re teaching.“ Poole explain-
ed. "At first there was resistance
from the communities because
they felt that their needs weren‘t
being served by the Teacher
Corps. Public relations have im-
proved. but it's taken a long time
to allay those fears."

Community leaders have helped
interns and both groups exchange
ideas in seminars.

Pitt‘s thirty interns will com-
plete their training in April. and
another cycle will begin in July.
Reading will be emphasized in the
program.

Recruitment goals include 24
blacks and 24 whites. with an
equal number of men and women.

Oakland offers a real -variety

Cutting short hair is boring.
Long hair is more versatile to
work with. You can do more with
it.

razor cut is neat. trimmed. but
also gives the appearance of a full

V . ' There is little need to establish that our society

 H  ilflt is my feeling ithough not empirically prov-
 ‘ " enfactl that polarization can be largely traced to
-‘ ~ ithegdecision of many political groupings. ranging
from Spiro to Stokely. to use fear as an instrument
of social reform. or social reaction.
A The American people are always mobilized by
xjfthe negative aspects of a problem rather than the
possible solutions. It is certainly more efficient
to use fear in the short run. If I tell a white man
T ‘about the supression of blacks in America. if I
A ' educate him to the history of blacks. their econo-
 mic status. I may eventually persuade him to put
 hfforthericoncerted and constructive effort towards

‘less black people are given an equal footing in America. I may
_ . ‘ frighten him. in a matter of seconds. into following my lead. and
W-  ‘supplying whatever I would say Black people need.
I . With this method of mobilization. a man would not have the time
nor the inclination to analize the problem. If I have inadequately de-
'fined the problem. if I have misdiagnosed the solution. there is no
. ‘one to correct me. rather. I would be pushed towards my ill-def‘ined

onservatives,While Others Are Activists?

by PAUL LE BLANC
Staff Columnist

George Orwell once wrote: "Doublethink
means the power of holding two contradictory be-
liefs in ones mind simultaneously. and accepting
both of them." Many American conservatives
misquote Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four to but-
tress their own ideology. but no group is more
guilty of the practice of doublethink.

For example. conservatives denounce concen-
trations of power in the government. in unions.
and in various social movements as threats to in-
dividual liberty.

But they quietly accept the massive power of

THE “SILENT MAJORITY”

ITS. corporations i500 corporations. controlled
by a few thousand people. control two—tliirds of the
non-farm economy. and from this flows immense
political power as welll: in fact. they vigorously
attack any threat to this particular concentration
of power as—~a threat to individual liberty?

Similarly, conservatives frequently argue that
irrationality and brutishness are inherent in the
nature of man. Yet when discussing human behav-
ior in relation to the “free market economy" (i.e.,
capitalism), they offer hymns to human reason
and virtue worthy of the most naive 18th century
philosophy. ’

Those of us who believe that the economic dic-
tatorship and injustice of the status quo must be
transcended are dismissed. at best. as good—heart-
ed sclinooks who are deluded by visions of some
future utopia; such utopias are by definition im-
possible. we are told

 

In the next breath. however. they offer ‘us
their own utopia—the status quo! Thus. we are in-
formed that in our own society individuals have
"acquired the right to pursue their own ends un-
inhibited.“ More than this. important places in
society are awarded to those who have ability:
"Whoever gets the job done best receives his just
due."

Of course, the conservative asserts that we are
witnessing a “reversal of this trend” because cer-
tain narrow-minded interest groups, dominated by
a perverse “group mentality,” have been win-
ning special privileges. Aha!

Perhaps well at last be treated to a right-wing
attack on the National Association of Manufac-
turers. the American Medical Association. the
military—industrial lobb_v. etc. But no! We are in-
formed that the real culprits are the Black Action
Society and the Women’s Liberation movement.

l\'ow it's a documented fact that the average
income of blacks and women. even if theyye had
superior education to white and male counter-
parts. have traditionally been significantly lower:
this has also been the case with employment op-
portunities.

Nor can it be denied that blacks and women have
traditionally faced humiliation and degradation in
various aspects of our cultural life. Historically.
the inferior position of these groups has been in-
stitutionalized by various laws and political struc-
tures. There are sound reasons for the growth of
“group consciousness” and group demands among
black people and women.

But the conservatives feel compelled to attack
those who are unable to rest contendedwitliin the
"market economy." Thus. to cite another exam-
ple. a union of impoverished migrant farm labor-
ers is denounced as a vicious tyranny. while the
wealthy and powerful agricultural corporations
which have traditionally taken advantage of them
are portrayed as the underdogs.

The classic conservative retort seems to be:
“The standard of living in capitalist America is
the highest in the world. Those who protest are
ungrateful and irrational trouble makers!“

But man doesn’t live by bread alone. Just be-
cause we’re not all starving Armenians doesn’t
mean that the United States actually provides
freedom and justice for all.

And as George Orwell suggested. if "the great
mass of human beings who are normally stupified
by poverty became literate and would learn to
think for themselves . . . they would sweep it away.
In the long run. a hierarchical society is only pos-
sible on the basis of poverty and ignorance.“

People in America are thinking and growing
numbers are fighting against various forms of in-
justice and authoritarianism. Orwell hoped that
people might finally free themselves from all of
the rationalizations and deceptions of doublethink
and establish a socialist democracy. And per-
haps. finally. they will.

Baum Explains Prologue Program

by SCOTT BAUM
Acting Chairman, Cabinet
of Arts and Sciences

On Saturday. Jan. 23. in L-9
Clapp Hall at 9:30 a.m.. the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences tI<‘ASi
will meet to debate and vote on
the Prologue Program. This pro-
gram is pivotal to the entire
program of academic change the
CAS has undertaken in the past
two years.

I have voted on every issue
before the FAS since its incep-
tion in April of 1969; opposi-
tion to various changes. from
abolition of the Language Re-
quirement on has been met with
the objection. on the part of
some faculty. that we are at-
tacking the problems inherent
in the College curriculum in a
piecemeal fashion. without an
overall plan of change.

The Prologue Program il’I’i
is not an overall plan for reason-
ed change. it is. however. the
first proposal to bring together
all other reforms to this point as
a coherent whole. All the other

I . changes the FAS has made until
. now-_7.‘hav_e_; jbeen _ articulated:

around the need and desire to
maximize each students op-
tions in planning their own ed-
ucation. Languages can still be
studied. grades can still be
opted for. but the decision rests
almost entirely with the student.

There is no question that all
students coming to Pitt are to
differing extents confused and
disoriented. All the options
available do little but add to the
confusion and make life a bit
harder. The aim of the PP is to
make students aware of the re-
sources of the University and
how they may be best used to
nice: their needs. It is not de-
signed to give them absolute and
authorative answers in every
field but to help them learn to
learn how to find those answers.

It is an optional program.
those uncomfortable with the
freedom involved need not par-
ticipate and those who partici-
pate have three years more in
which to integrate themselves
into. or simply opt for. a more
traditional academic system. In

the-1atter’ca,se’at least they will‘
,, have discovered what op-.tion‘s_--_

 

   
 

are available to them and how
to use them.

In any case this issue will
come to a vote Saturday. and as‘
it seems now. with only a small
number of voting students pre-
sent to carry the discussion for
all CAS students. I urge all stu-
dents to at.tend. to speak. to lis-
ten. to make known your con-
cern. This is not a rap session. a
vote will mean acceptance and
implementation or rejection.

Rejection augers poorly for
future change and experimenta-
tion and we must change and ex-
periment constantly if we are
to meet the needs of students.
And if all that is meaningless,
consider that you are paying
anywhere from $230 to $980 to be
part of a system the nature of
which is in large part determin-
ed at meetings like this one.

If you would like more infor-
mation on the PP. please feel
free to contact me at ext. 453
or at 687-7049. and come. what-
ever your position "is. because

-you will haveto live with*the

result. ‘

Forced back to the country-
side in 1946. the Viet Minh be-
gan to build peasant support.
They began to promote agrarian
reforms. new health measures.
new political organizations. The
focus of power in Vietnam be-
gan to return to the village. the
living place of the great ma-
jority of Vietnamese.

In those villages the Viet
Minh increasingly strong as the
war progressed. continually de-
veloped that form of revolution-
ary struggle now known as
“people war."

Joseph Alsop. a hawkish Am-
erican journalist. traveling
through the Viet Minh areas of
the Mekong Delta in 1954 com-
merited:

At first it was difficult to conceive a Com-
munist government's genuinely “serving the
people.” I could hardly imagine a Commun-
ist government that was also a popular gov-
ernment and almos‘ a democratic govern-
ment. But this is just the sort of government
the palm-hut state actually was while the
struggle with. the French continued. The Viet
Minh could‘ not possibly have carried on the
resistance for one year, let alone nine years,
without the people's strong, united support..

Viet Minh General Vo Nguyen
Giap inflicted a series of stun-
ning defeats on the retreating
French forces. By 1954. France
appealed to the U.S. for direct
military intervention. The U.S.
government at this point was
financing 80% of the French col-
onial struggle. Although sym-
pathy existed for military inter-

vention from the likes of Secre-
tary of State John Foster Dulles
(who advocated nuclear bomb-
ing) and then Vice-President.
Richard Nixon. Congress disap-
proved.

On Ma_V.7. 1954. the Viet Minh
overran Dienbienphu. This was
Waterloo again for the French.
A conference had already con-

vened at Geneva. Switzerland.
attended by China. Russia.
France. Britain. the U.S. and
the Democratic Republic of Viet-
nam

While only one indigenous
group. the Viet Minh. had maj-
or political power throughout
Indochina. Ho Chi Minh was
somehow persuaded by a joint
Sino-Soviet effort to settle for
half his country.

The agreement signed be-
tween France and the Viet Minh

IIS Policy Violates Geneva Accords

provided for a regroupment of
military forces pending the ar-
rangement of national elections.
The 17th parallel. dividing the
country in half. was chosen as a
demarcation line.

Civil administration of the re-
spective territories was to be in
the hands of the Viet Minh in
the North and the French (not
Bao Dai) in the south.

The provisions provide that the
Viet Minh were to participate
fully in political activities of the
south prior to the elections of
1956.

Both zones were forbidden to
make military alliances with oth-
er nations or receive troop rein-
forcements and military supplies
from the outside.

The agreement in no way
partitioned Vietnam into two
separate and independent na-
tions. A "cease—fire" existed be-
tween the two sides and the 17th
parallel was only a "provisional
military demarcation line that
should not in any way be inter-
preted as constituting a politi-
cal or territorial boundary” lar-
ticles 1 and 8; article 6. Final
Declaration). The Final Declar-
ation was endorsed by all the na-
tions at the conference except
the United States.

The United States decided. as
General James Gavin has re-
ported. that "we would not at-
tack North Vietnam. but we
would support a South Vietna-
mese government that we hoped
would provide a stable. indepen-
dent government that was rep-
resenting the people.“

This flagrant violation of the
Geneva accords marks the es-
sence of American foreign policy
since 1954.

Letter From Ishtray

by BARRY J. SHLACHTER

Dearest Barry.
I think this will be my last letter to you.  

Please try to understand; it is as hard for me as I am sure it_is
for you. We both had a good time and no harm was done. but now
I think we should draw our relationship to a close.

My father thought we stopped corresponding months ago and I
am sure he never found out about our little weekend together. We
learned alot from each other and I can most definitely say— I regret
nothing. I like you. Barry. You have the gentle soul of a delicate
bird. a sparrow or a wren. perhaps. Though you are no Troy Dona-
hue. you have very distinctive features. not unlike Belmondo. But
then. you know what I really like about you . . .

We are still both young and have the rest of our lives before us.
You. I am sure. will continue your devil-may-care flirtation with the
world and its dangers. I will never forget you; and the memory”I
have of you will long be cherished. like that first flower you gave
me. (no one ever gave me a Kleenix-flower Corsage before).

I am sure you have been reading those sensationalist. exploita-

tion articles about me and my ‘beau‘—Cox. I only hope they haven't...

hurt you too deeply. The relation Cox and I have is different than
the one you and I had shared. He's quite intelligent. you know, but
you wouldn‘t believe me if I told you he sat through three screen-
ings of ‘Chisum‘ with my father. ..

Yes. the relationship that you and I had was considerably dif-
ferent. Come to think of it. if it wasn‘t for you. perhaps I would nev-
er have had a chance to spend a night at a Howard Johnson Motel.

Barry. my dear. believe me when I tell you that you do mean

something to me. And you must certainly know that we can not al-
ways have what we honestly and sincerely crave.

Let this letter say good-bye for us. I know it will be difficult

and a heavy burden for the heart. But remember. if true love always I

ended happily. there would never have been a Romeo and Juliet for
Shakespeare to write.

Love.
Tricia

Trish. my love.

I understand your sentiments perfectly and my mind tells me it 

is correct. but my heart continues to long for you.
forever yours.

Barry

I haven't been to the Pitts-
burgh Playhouse too often this
year — twice. as a matter of fact.
The first was for “Everything in
the Garden“ which was Leland
Starne‘s show.

My second visit was for “No
Strings." the Richard Rogers‘
musical which didn't quite make
it on Broadway. and does about
the same at the Playhouse.

The story is about a rather
poorly motivated writer who
goes off to Paris after one suc-
cessful novel and meets a fam-
ous fashion model. They fall in
love and at the end he returns to
America while she maintains
her career in Paris.

She is black, by the way, and
Rogers does little in dialogue to
thrash this about. There are just
two people who fall in love. It
is a pleasant story but not much
of one. It's one of those musi-
cals where a song seems to pre-
cede and follow every line.

The music is not really up to
Rogers‘ reputation. and with the
exception of" "No Strings." "The
Sweetest Sounds." and one or
two others. they are just a group
of nice little tunes lifting you
here and there.

The set. which was done by

Harrison Emerges

by CINDY MORGAN V

“No Strings”

Pitt News Drama Critic

Mary Ellen Kennedy. and the
costumes lb_\' Elizabeth Kaleri
are imaginative and creatively
executed. The lights. however.
are for the most part only suffi-
cient.

I find it difficult to under-
stand how the Playhouse can tol-
erate such technical errors as
seen on both my visits.

Spots didn't go on. lights stay-
ed on too long after being with-
drawn from the stage. and a
noticeable sixty cycle humn
came from the speaker above my
head during most of the show.
In addition. heads popped out
from behind the stage. which
does nothing to impress me of
the professionality of the Play-
houses staff".

Director Tom Thomas has
done little to improve the show.
Blocking is just "plain old stuff.“
and aside from the creative set
and costumes and some fine
acting and singing here and

there. a great deal of "No
Strings" never gets off the
ground.

Performances by some of the
major characters show a great
deal of professional skill and tal-
ent (George Ball as David Jor-
dan, Robert Watts as Louis De-
Pourtal, Helen Wayne Rauh as

Mollie Plummer. Beth Austin as
Jeanette Valmy).

Others almost make it «Bar-
bara Woodruff as Sharon Pow-
ell. George Macuire as Luc l)el-
bert. Lenora .\'emetz as Comfort
0‘Connell. Jerry Morris as .\like
Robinsoni. and some don‘t make
it at all «Robin Richards as Ga-
brielle Bertini.

I especially found Beth Aus-
tin delightful as well as Sharon
Powell. who with good training
should become outstanding.

Choreography by Marion Pe-
trov was almost amateur with
the exception of some of the
one-to-one numbers. The large
production number’s looked
about 4th rate Ice Capades. The
dance chorus did little to help
anything, except trying to look
like they knew what they were
doing.

Then again. if you can't be
good. you can look that way
and hope. At the Playhouse this
week. its about half a success in
both categories. “No Strings"
will pla_v through February 31st.
Hopefully by now —— there is
some improvement —— so if its
not too cold outside there may
be enough there to keep your
feet warm — and perhaps then
some.

The "Quiet One” does It Alone

ASST. ENTERTAINMENT
EDITOR

George Harrison. always lab-
eled the "Quiet One" during his
association with the Beatles. has
overcome the unwritten leader-
ship of John Lennon and Paul
.\IcCartney with All Things Must
Pass an Apple recording which
emerges as the best album to
date done by any of the four
individually.

A three—record set housed in a
box. the album is almost en-
tirely written by Harrison. The
lead song. I’d have you Any-
time was written with the l_vri—
cal assistance of Bob Dylan.
while If Not For You was com-
posed entirely by Dylan.

.\Iany of Harrisons tunes re-
flect his Hindu philosophy. as
th()se who follow him might have
suspected.

My Sweet Lord , also released
as a single, often initially sounds
like a Christian hymn. But as the
record draws to a close, the Hare

Krishna chant begins disclos-

ing the “Lord” Harrison had

in mind.

"Awaiting on you all" relays one of Harrison's
key messages of the album.

ll you open up your heart, you will see what I
mean

You've been polluted so long there’s a way
tor you to get clean
. You don't need no church house, you
don't need no temple

And you don't need no rosary beads or them
books to read to see that you've fallen.

I<1ssentially. Harrison is saying
that everyone must belong and fit
into something; he is saying that
you don't need anything to see
your state — it is felt in the con-
sciousness.

All Things Must Pass, the al-
bums title song. deals with the

arclietypal theme. saying that
things change nothing lasts
forever

Isn't ‘it A Pity primarily tells
how people are always hurting
one another without thinking;
people can't see that we are
all basically the same. And "be-
cause of all their tears, their
eyes can't see the beauty that
surrounds them.”

Harrison‘s love songs are re-

 

freshingly different — serious and
often thought provoking.

The poetry of the l_vrics are
far superior to that on any al-
bum released for years. includ-
ing some of those released by
the Beatles themselves.

Some of the best lyrics are
found in Run of the .VIill. Let
It Down. and The Art of Dying.

The special treat the package
has to offer is a third record.
Apple Jam, a jam session com-
prised with a little help from

Harrisons friends who happen to
be some of the greatest rock mu-
sicians of the decade.

Harrison is joined by Eric
Clapton. Ringo Starr. Ginger
Baker. Billy Preston. Dave .\Ia-
son lf0I‘III€I‘I_V of Traffic». and
others.

Unlike many other recorded
jam sessions, Apple Jam is well
edited and put together. As a
matter of fact, it sounds better
than many albums which are re-
leased after a group had prac-
ticed awhile.

The third disc is mostly instru-
mental. and was recorded while
Harrison was working on the rest
of the album. One light vocal
touch is added in an insane little
birthday song entitled. It's John-
nie’s Birthday.

Unlike many of the albums
released by the other three Bea-
tles. you don‘t have to be a Bea-
tle fan to appreciate the lyric
and a melodic beauty. It is an
album that you certainly won't
grow tired of". Harrison has final-
ly broken free to polish his tal-
ents and find his individuality.

Sunday Concert Ends

ASST. ENTERTAINMENT
EDITOR

Primed by Saturday night's
overwhelming performance. those
of the Freak Week audience re-
turned again Sunday to Syria
Mosque hoping for a repeat of
the prior evenings success.

As the doors opened at 7:30
p.m.. masses of people flowed
like a human conveyor belt into
the Mosque. shivering from the
bitter cold. .\'obody had to walk
into the Mosque that evening:
you were simply pushed by the
force of the crowd.

Taj .\1ahal opened the concert
and fullfilled the crowd's expec-
tations. It was no doubt that this
was the best performance of the
evening and the crowd went wild
with appreciation.

Mahal’s music was steeped in
Dixieland, and spiced with blues,
rock, and folk with a mellow
blend of horns, including four
tubas together.

Taj Mahal displayed a diver-

sit_v of talent that evening as he
did some songs with acoustical
guitar minus back-up group. play-
ed the harmonica. and piccolo.
whistled. and belted his way
through the blues.

And most importantly. he lent
warmth and a personal touch to
his performance while building a
tremendous rapport with the au-
dience.

Some of Taj Mahal‘s numbers
included “Farther on down the
Road You Will Accompany Me”,
“Oh John, Ain’t It Hard”, and
“I‘m Goin’ Out To The Country
and Paint My Mailbox Blue”. In
response to thunderous demand
for an encore, Mahal did the
bluesy, “You Ain't No Street-
walker Mama, But You Sure
“Know How to Strut Your Stuff.”

Following. Taj Mahal came
the exciting Allman Brothers.
Their music was typically very
electric and amplified and con-
tained much improvisation.

possessed a superior percussion
group comprised of two drum-
mers who stayed remarkably to-
gether throughout their perfor-
mances.

Last, but certainly not least
came Little Richard. After great
fanfare provided by his entour-
age the Crown Jewels, Little
Richard swooped onstage smil-
ing profusely and giving the
peace sign to a screaming au-
dience.

His silver lame pants and
sparkling outfit threw beams of
light all over the Mosque ceil-
ing and walls as he sat down to
belt out such oldies as “Lucille".
"Good Golly. Miss Molly."
“Chain of Fools". and "Midnight
Special“.

show was characterized by sev-

bers such as "When the Saints
Go Marchin’ In" and “Blue-
berry Hill".

Little Richard demonstrated
the style which at one time made
him King, and the audience was
really with him. That is, until he

angrily screamed at his body-_

guard, “I am the Star, and as
long as I pay your salary, you
remember it.” and continued to
mortify the guard.

dience fairly hostile. and many
"boos“ and four—letter catcalls
were disgustedly thrown toward
the stage. In many cases. how-
ever. they were drowned out by
the lo_val high-school students
who attended the concert.

Little Richard soon got tired of
just sitting and playing. and be-
fore long he was atop the grand
piano singing and dancing till
the piano literally shook beneath
his weight. It was then that Lit-
tle Richard pulled a trick remin-
iscent of the era in which he was
originally popular.

He pulled his white boots from
his feet, teased the crowd, then
threw them to the crowd who
scrambled furiously so that they
could be the one to cop the prize.

Soon the dream was over. and
Little Richard. lavender lipstick-
ed and properly mascara—ed.
proudly walked off the stage.

It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-

All told, this car has 89 things you've never

ln fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.

Craplers Smash Indian

Scoring points at will and ac-
cumulating seven falls. the Pitt
grapplers crushed Indiana l'ni-
versit_v of Pennsylvania last
night. 43-2. at the Indiana Me-
morial Field House.

Despite the absence of both
Mark and Randy Payne. John
(Thatman and Jim Caramana. the
Panther matmen took control at
the outset of each bout and applied
pressure from the opening whis-
tle to the closing buzzer.

Al Cox. making his varsity de-
but at 118. started the route by
pancaking his opponent on his
wa_v to a first period fall.

A few minutes later. Gary
McClure made the team score
10-0 by pinning his foe. McClure,
somewhat discontented at being
second string. and a letterman at
126 last year. was understandably
excited by his initial varsity com-
petition of the 1970-71 wrestling
season.

Coming off an embarrassing
loss against Navy. Dave Wylie
displayed a cross-body ride and
third-period aggressiveness to
capture the 134 pound bout. 7-3.

tain Bobby Kuhn rolled to his

WVL' hasn't broken a Trees

record that's topped a Pitt mark
is in the one-meter diving event.
The Mountaineers Dave Holovics
has scored 303.40. while Pitts
Dave Wessel has chalked up
293.85. But as Grant puts it. “Dave
Wessel improves as the season
goes on.“

Grant doesn't consider the
WVU team to be as strong as the
Bucknell squad. "What we have
to do is wheel our men around in
the right positions." he added.

Grant cites the fact that the
meet is at home as an advantage.

“Inner feelings count" stated
Pitt senior Mike Beatty. “Thats
why I compete. There is a lot
of pride for the individual in
gymnastics.

“My high school gym teacher
told me that I had potential‘ in
— gymnastics. Since there was a
challenge of sort and the pro-

mise of potential I went out for
I the team."

After three years on the Penn
. Hills gymnastic team, Mike,
 nicknamed ‘Zelmo’ by his team-
'mates, captured third place in
vaulting at the Pennsylvania
g state championship.

After encountering bad grades
his freshman year here at Pitt.
Mike decided that the gym
team was taking up t.oo much
‘ study time. so he decided to
quit the team.

"I really didn‘t think I was
very good. and my academic
standing was in jeopardy. I did
the only thing I could do."

But gymnastics was his only
outside activity. '

_. "Being a commuter and being
A ’ on the gym team was my only
outlet where I could relax in-
stead of going home.“ '

In his sophomore year he re-
joined the team.

“For the past two years since
then I really wasn’t an excep-
tional performer.

His scores on sidehorse were
consistant. over this time per-
‘iod. Early in the season his
scores were in the middle sixes
and by the end of the season
improved to the mid sevens. But
this year his senior year has
been different.

"I practiced last summer for
the first time." Beatty said. “I
” continued my junior years
A improvement throughout the

_ summer.

“I decided I had to be good
so that I could look back on
-my experience in the sport fa-
vorably.”

He has done this. His scores
have improved by well-over a
point. He is scoring in the mid-
 ‘and upper-eights for the first
'  time in his career.

Partially because of this-—and
his attitude to the sport—his fel-

With ‘the arrival of Coach
‘Buzz' Ridl on the Pitt basket-
ball scene three seasons ago.
Sophomore guard Bill Downes
found himself with an oppor-
tunity to play his kind of basket-
ball.

In the years preceeding Ridl‘s
appearance Pitt was highlighted
by a run—and-shoot attack. The
deliberate. versatile offense that
Ridl employs paved the way for
the team ballplayer. which is
the type of player Downes hap-
pens to be. -

"This system is really good
for me." Downes said. "I have
to work with other people to be
affective. It really helps me
out." -

It took three years to mould
the kind of team Ridl wanted,
but the Panthers of 1970-71 have
established his style and are
proving it can be successful.

“Wlien the coach first got
here everybody was fighting
against ‘ him." Downes said.

"We were 4-20 that first year.
He was used to his particular
type of basketball player at
Westminster and we were used
to a certain type of coach here."

The Panthers. now midway
through the season. have a 7-5
record with what Downes labels
"the tough part of the season"
over. They have beaten establish-

ed‘ teams like Davidson. Du-
quesne. and Wisconsin. while V
dropping t'our of their five

losses away from the home Field

Mike mentioned that he has
received satisfaction from the
gymnastics.

“This is a real good experi-
ence, he said. “It is one of the
best I have ever had. It is an
opportunity for me to show
off my abilities, and to be proud
and confident of what I can do."

"But. with our team losing
so often it makes it luii to win.
But I have learned a lot more
from losing than from winning.

"You get to know what. it is
all about. You learn to accept
your strong points and accept
your weak ones. But you still
learn to enjoy yourself.“

It will be most interesting to
see how Beatty fares against the
winning machine Tom Kerr to-
night.

“It’s the ballplayers,” Downes
said describing the reason for
the Cager success. “And it’s

getting close together. You
hear pro players, on teams that
are really good, talking about
how close they are. That's one
thing we’re starting to get."

Downes. a hard-nosed ball-
handler from Avalon Pennsyl-

to be a threat. If I don‘t. the

getting the drives and short

Winning on the road has been
a big problem for the Panthers,
but Downes claims “we have
a taste of it with the win over

the ‘home court advantage—and
it’s true. It’s really tough to win
on the road. it’s tough_to jump

“I tried to get the charge on
him earlier when he knocked
me over. The first time I went
down, and we got all tangled
up. The second time he knocked
me down, he kicked me in the
chest so I went after him. I
had him on the ground, and he
said something like ‘I’m not go-
ing to swing,’ so I got off him."

The Pitt team was ready to
come to Downes‘ aid if peace

hadn‘t been restored quickly.
"I remember two years ago."
Downes commented. "if the
same thing happened they‘d
e (the team) let the guy fight it
out."

This is an indication of the
type of cohesion the cagers

feel for each other. and the team
this year. "Everyone helps
each other out there. When
Buzzy"s (Harrison) on the bench
he gives me tips on what I'm
doing wrong. and I do the same
for him. Its like that with
everybody. They all believe
in what they're doing."

Downes is undecided about
what he’ll do af.ter college. "'I’m
considering teaching and busi-

ness,” he says. “I’ve had a
couple interviews but I still
don’t know. The draft is also

something I have to concern
myself with.”

But the basketball season is
his present concern. and he sees
a very successful season in the
making. Downes sees a possible

Squash and Tennis 

by JAN FRY

Last’ month when Pitt‘s Dr. “Go1die" Edwards
took first.place in the Canadian Open Squash Tour-
nament. she received a large silver bowl as a tro-
phy. However. she wasn't permitted to bring it
across the border.

"I did receive a lovely pin as a rememberance."
remarked the Pitt phys-ed teacher and coach. “The
trophy was a table sort of thing—too heavy for me
to possibly carry.“

One less trophy in the case shouldn‘t matter to
“Goldie“
years.

In her homeland New
Zealand she started
playing tennis at the
age of 12, and in 1962,
she came to the United
States under the New

opment Program. Since
then she has won the
West Canadian Air
Force singles tennis
title and the Canadian
singles, doubles and
mixed doubles titles.

Pittsburgh in 1962, Dr. Edwards participated in
badmitton competition. winning the Saskatchewan
State title and placing third in singles in the Mid-
West. However. since Pittsburgh didn‘t have a
team. she decided to take up a new sport, squash.

“Goldie” Gets Trophies
Most Of The Time

During the nine years she's been playing the
game. she‘s captured numerous squash titles. Last
year she was ranked third nationally. She took the
New. Jersey State title last year and this year. and
in 1968. Dr. Edwards was captain of the U.S.
squash team in the Wolfenoel competition. where
U.S. andBritish teams meet.

“Over there they play with a different ball and on
different type of court, so it was difficult,” Dr. Ed-
wards explained.

The English team won the competition.

Of course. her latest competition was in the Ca-
nadian Open. where contestants were from every
part of Canada. “Goldie" Edwards participates in
women‘s and men‘s tournaments.

“It’s excellent practice,” she stated modestly. “I
really can't identify with women’s lib. When I've
played with men’s racquet clubs they’ve always
made special arrangements. I can remember when
I played in the University Club Tournament how
they cleared the men’s locker room to get me to the
courts.”

Dr. Edwards also mentioned that squash is the
only sport in the country which permits women to
participate in men‘s tournaments.

How does all of her traveling to tournaments
affect her teaching schedule at Pitt?

“This term I‘m teaching health-ed and some
graduate courses. Sometimes I teach a bit of fit-
ness.“ she ‘explained. "I really don‘t teach that
much squash and tennis. Since I‘m so busy I cut
down on the soci‘alizing—that's what is effected by

the platforms that have never

been attempted by anyone else in '

the world. "

Mrs. Virginia Grindell, a mem-

ber of the Pitt Physical Education

Department and coordinator of I

the event, stated that the response

to the College Workshop that will-

precede the Spectacular has been
overwhelming. Over 250 people

have enrolled in the workshop. A
These people represent 14 states.

and 118 colleges and universities,

along with a number of high.

schools, YMCAS, and people from
the AAU.

“The Aquatic Spectacular has“

two aims," Mrs. Grindell explain-

ed. "The first is to give an educa- '

tion in both intermediate and ad-
vanced skills in these two sports.
The second objective is to intro-
duce these two aquatic sports to
the city and the University of
Pittsburgh.“

Mrs. Grindell concluded by not-'
ing that tickets for the event are

on sale now at the Field House 6

ticket office for $2.50 each. There
are only 700 tickets available and
350 have already been sold so it is
imperative that anyone interest-

ed buy their tickets now. Buses to ‘

the event will be leaving the Tow-

ers an hour before the show and I

leaving Trees Hall for a half hour
after the Aquatic Spectacular.

 

 

The Women's Synchronized_
Swimming Team is holding
practices on Monday through
Thursday at 3:30 and 5 p.m.
More swimmers are needed so
that meets can be scheduled
for the season. Anyone inter-
ested in joining the team can
contact Mrs. Grindell at Rees
Hall.
