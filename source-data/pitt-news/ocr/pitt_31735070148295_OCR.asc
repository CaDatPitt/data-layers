Senior Sta_ﬂ° Writer

Don’t ask them if the sport is magi-
cal.

It’s not. There’s nothing magical
about sweat, hard work and inju-
ries.

Don’t ask them if they play for
Slytherin or Gryffmdor.

The answer is ‘neither, and the
question is asked far too often.

But ask the members of Pitt’s V

Quidditch World Cup team who they
do play for, and they’ll proudly tell
you they represent the Quidditch
team that tookthird
place in last year’s
international World
Cup. And this year,
they plan to win it
all.

In the three years
since the Pitt Quid-
ditch team formed,

women who prac-
tice the muggle, or

sion of the sport popularized inJ.K.
Rowling’s “Harry Potter’? novels
have taken the Quidditch world by
storm.

100 teams. 2,000 players. One
cup. S 2

Friday, Pitt’s Quidditch team will
pile into ﬁve cars, brooms in tow,
and make the drive to Randall’s Is-
land in New York City for the inter-
national tournament known as the
Quidditch World Cup.

The ﬁfth annual tournament will
take place this weekend, and Pitt’s
Quidditch team will begin play Sat-
urday against Tufts University, who

defeated Pitt in last year’s semiﬁ-

nals. At the conclusion of Sunday’s
championship, one team will win
the coveted World Cup.

. Pitt enters the Quidditch World
Cup for the third time this year,
ranked 10th internationally by the
International Quidditch Association,
the nonproﬁt organization that hosts
the annual tournament. One hun-
dred teams are expected to attend
this year’s tournament — almost

double the number that competed-

at the World Cup last year. Teams

that wish to compete sign up for the
World Cup through the IQA.

Most teamsrepresent American
universities, but teams from com-
munities and high schools, several
Canadian provinces and at least two
overseas nations —— Finland and the

    

‘ U.K. —— will compete as well.

“The World Cup is really the only
opportunity to play teams from that
far away,” Pitt team founder and co-

‘ captainJohn Battaglia said.

This year’s tournament holds
special meaning for Pitt Quidditch.
For Battaglia and his broom-riding
brigade of seniors, the end is near.

Battaglia and fellow seniors

 -.  

Jeff Moulton, Pat Dalsass, Diane
Manovich, Sean O’Brien,Jon Rubin,
Jason Lawrence, ‘Doug Puchko and
Jared Duffy‘- most of whom were
founding members of Pitt Quidditch
— will conclude their collegiate

‘ Quidditch careers this weekend. '

“For all the seniors, this is our
last shot at winning a World Cup.

‘ There’s deﬁnitelyan air of urgency,”

Battaglia said. .
From books to reality . ;

~Quidditch involves players run- *
ning up and down a 48—by—33-yard ‘

oval—shaped ﬁeld. -

“Quidditch players are people
who are legitimately athletic and
down for just kind of crazy stu ,”
Battaglia said.

Like in the “Harry Potter” books,
the goal is for the “chasers” (posi-
tion players‘ like strikers in soccer)
to score as many times as possible by
throwing a ball, a volleyball known
as the quafﬂe, through the top of
one of three lollipop-shaped goals

guarded by a “keeper” on either end '

of the field.
‘ Although unlike in the books,
players can’t ﬂy, they must still hold

a broom between their legs as they
run, according to ofﬁcial Intema—
tional Quidditch Association rules.

Players earn 10 points for each
time they successfully throw the

quaffle through a goal. However, -

position players known as beaters
are on standby with dodgeballs to
temporarily knock chasers out of the
game. bgforethsycan score.-_.. '

The aspect of uidditchthat sets

that it contains a game within the

, While the chasers, beaters and
keepers battle for quaffle points,
another position player known as
the seeker searches '
for the snitch. In
Potterverse, the
snitch is an elusive
ball with wings, but

it’s an elusive man

The snitch leaves the ﬁeld of play
at the beginning of the game to hide,
but returns after a predetermined
amount of time (usually 15 minutes)

to give the seiikers a better chance of

  have a seeker. When
a seeker successfully yanks the
sock from the snitch’s waistband,
that seeker earns 30 points for his
team, and the game ends. The game
continues until the snitch is caught.
However, catching the snitch does
not guarantee a victory.

“It’s like a mix of dodgeball,
rugby, basketball and soccer,” junior
chaser Sa'ra?Dugan said.

During Quidditch practices, usu-
ally on the Cathedral lawn, members
of other club sportsteams such as
rugby will sometimes inquire what
the students on the brooms are up
to. .

“They’ll ask, ‘What is this? Can
we play?”’ said Dugan, who believes
many of these athletic Quidditch
novices come away from a practice
with greater respect for the sport.

Taking the team to new
heights I

The Quidditch club evolved from
an aﬁer—class escape for ﬁve friends
to an organization that welcomed 60
students to try out for a2I-_member- ‘

‘I But gaining respect on campus
has proved a struggle for the Quid-
ditch team since its inception in the
spring of 2009.

“It took us a little while to be
taken seriously,” Battaglia said.

The club had difﬁculty acquiring
funds from the Student Government
Board for tournament expenses dur-
ing its ﬁrst two years. Battaglia said
that trend changed this year when
the team received funds from the
Allocations Committee to attend the
Quidditch World Cup. a

' “I’m really happy that before I
graduate, the club is established
and new captains won’t have to go
through the stressful time we went
through,” he said.

The Quidditch team practices

*—H1!"\‘

one to three times a week during the I

more competitive fall season. Dugan
said that because of the lack of col-
legiate Quidditch teams in the area,
players often scrimmage among

‘themselves. Last week, Pitt’s team

catehingit I... - t  J‘

played a scrimmage with Carnegie
Mellon’s newly formed Quidditch

team. She said that while Pitt’s team_

has yet to host a game, it hopes to
have a tournament on campus in
the spring.

How to succeed at muggle
Quidditch _

There are two major strategies
in the world of muggle Quidditch.
Teams either rely on muscle or
speed. Pitt’s team banks its success
on the latter. I ’

“We use our athletic, speedy

chasers to get out tb an early lead,” 1

Battaglia said.

Team members say that at least
half their total goals are scored by
arguably the fastest players on the
team, sophomore chasers Kurt
Rishel and Andrew Bulman.

“We have some big guys, but we
mostly rely on ﬁnesse and skill, not
brawn,” Dugan said.

Pitt will need to bring all the

speed, ﬁnesse and skill it can muster '

to New York if it wants to overcome

No. 2—ranked University of Kansas, _

who’ ‘handed Pitt its only loss this
year at the Midwest Quidditch Cup,
and No. 1—ranked Middlebury, the
school where muggle Quidditch was
founded and the champion of all four
Quidditch World Cups to date.

“VVe’ve only lost one major match, H

andthatwasbyasnitchcatc ,”junior
chaser Heather Kraus said, referring
to the loss to University of Kansas.
“We’ve never lost by points.”

Quidditch initiates can watch ma-
jor games from the World Cup on

match will stream on the site Satur-
day at 8:20 p.m.

“Pitt students should pregame
their Saturday night by watching our

we score,” Battaglia said.

completed his MCAT for medi-
cal school.

“Any time spent with him,
whether it was studying for the
MCAT or taking practice MCATS
or anything, was just so much
fun,” Young said. “He was very
optimistic. He could find hu-
mor in anything. I think that
was one of my favorite things I
remember about him.”

Ireland and Peterson were
pursuing research in the Jeff
Brodsky laboratory in Pitt’s bio-
logical science department dur-
ing and after graduating from
Pitt. Brodsky served as one of
Peterson’s mentors throughout
his undergraduate career-and
time in the laboratory.

“I will always remember
Cameron’s smile and his enthu-
siasm about science. He was a
very talented researcher and a
pleasure to have as a member
of the lab,” Brodsky said in an
email.

Cristy Gelling, a postdoc-
toral scholar at Pitt, was one of I
Peterson’s more direct mentors.
She said that he had a major role‘
in research related to genetic

diseases.

“We will miss him mostly
for his vibrant presence in our
lives,” Gelling said in an email.
“He was confident and positive
and kept everyone in the lab
laughing. Nextvyear, our re-
search will be published in a
paper that we plan to dedicate
to Cameron’s memory.”

Peterson’s long-term plans
included enrolling in medi-
cal school. Ireland said that
the two of them crammed for
the MCATS, studied and went
through the application process
together. _

But Young said that despite '

the long hours Peterson put in
completing the medical school

I application process, his friends
" still knew him as down-to-earth

and relaxed. -
“He studied hard, but on the

weekends, you probably saw.

him out at the bar one time,”
Young said. “He just loved to
have fun, lay out in Schenley,
read, play music, go to the
bar with friends, have a good
beer.” -' V ’ t ' '

and Ireland would play pick-

up games of roller hockey at

‘Greenfield. Ireland said that
Peterson also enjoyed playing"

the guitar. . '

_,‘.fHe had, an obsession with
the Red Hot Chili Peppers and
Third Eye Blind,” Ireland said.
“Music was a big part of his life,
and  a lot of the memories
people have are related to music
or him singing..”

This ‘past Halloween, Peter-
son and another friend, Kurt

Weiberth, went out as the LM-

FAO duo Redfoo and SkyBlu.

jg “They were hilarious. ‘Party
Rock Anthem’ was played all
weekend, and they were danc-
ing and shufflin’. He said to me
that weekend [that he]«was lit-
erally having the best weekend
of his life,” Ireland said.

The memory ispbittersweet
for Ireland and Young, who can
look back and remember being
apart of the best moments of
Peterson’s life while‘ still realiz-
ing they’ve lost a dear friend.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

The Nov. 9 issue of The Pitt News
documents a big step toward reli-
gious equality. Pitt should be proud;
Sodexo, however, should be embar-
rassed. Foryears,Jewish Pittstudents
have advocated for Sodexo to provide
hot kosher meals. For afew years, cold
sandwiches and snacks have been
available in QuickZone and students
have had the option of pre-ordering
kosher meals through MarketTo—Go,
but these options still exclude kashrut
observing students from dining in

Market Central. Using these alterna-

tive options as an excuse, Sodexo has

' adamantly and consistently refused

to add hot kosher food to the regular
Market Central menu.

It’s great that Pitt and Sodexo are

bringing halal food into the dining

hall and that they are working with-

students to make on-campus dining
as accessible as possible. However,
these menu additions are happening
in a pick-and—choose way. The halal
food will be available to students
who eat in Market Central —'- not just
to thosewho only eat halal-certiﬁed

food — and the meals will cost the
same amount as the rest of thepfood
in Market Central. We have a hard
time believing that halal-certiﬁed
chicken costs the same amount as

' the regular chicken that Sodexo

purchases. If the University. truly
wants to bring together the student
body through food, then kosherfood
should be added to Market Central’s

repertoire alongside the newly added -

halal food.

Gibbs leads Pitt into opener

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Ashton Gibbs will transition into
an importantrole for the Pitt men’s
basketball team this season.

The senior guard e who led
Pitt with 16.8 points pergame last
season — isalready one of the
nation’s top 3-point shooters as
well as the Panthers’ top scoring

_ threat.

But when the Panthers face Al-
bany in today’s season opener, Pitt
also needs him to be a leader.

Last season, the Panthers had
three experienced seniors on the
team in Brad Wanamaker, Gary
McGhee and Gilbert Brown. With
those players gone, it’s up to Gibbs
to guide a team that features four

trujejjfreshmen-and two redshirt -

freshmen.

' “I’m not very vocal,” he said. .

“I’m still working on the vocal as-
pect  I think I lead by example,
and that’s what I’ve been doing for
a long time.” A ’ , V
_I-Ie’s often the ﬁrst one in the
gym and the last one to leave,
Gibbs added, and he knows the

plays well enough that-his,.1:eam- '

mates can come to him with ques-
tions. .

But he added that taking on
responsibility as a vocal leader
is becoming increasingly more
-important.

“Sometimes you’ve.got to be
loud, just because it’s a lot"'of
young guys this year,” Gibbs said.
“They don’t really know what they
are doing. Sometimes they forget
plays ...»but they work hard and
they listen.”

Head coach Jamie Dixon said
Gibbs has done’a good job in-

creasing his vocal presence, but ..

he added that the senior has al-
ways been more likely to lead by
example. , A ’

“I always say there’s two differ-
ent types of leaders: There’s the

vocal guy, and there’s a guy_that .
leads by example,” Dixon said. .

“His worth ethic is an inspiration,
it’s an example, it’s acoaching tool
for me. It’s there everyday. That

was fromday one.”  , . ,
Last year,‘-Dixon said that Gibbs

realized-ithat the three seniors

were the leaders of the team.
“You can only have"”so many

leaders,” Dixon said. “When you

had threeusolid leaders, youhave
to recognize, [that] .” V
' This year, it’s Gibbs’ turn. '
Redshirt sophomore Lamar
Patterson said that every member
of the team respects Gibbs. »
“He works hard and does ev-
erything you need to do,” Patter-

son said. “You can always depend ,

on him  he always showed that
he was a silent leader. This year

— he’s more vocal, just telling every-

one where they need to be at.” 1

That ability will be important  
on Friday, when the Panthers take _

the ﬂoor with three new starters.

Patterson came off the bench at

scoring a team-high 22 points in

Pitt’s~ 76-67 win over Division II

Dixon said that no matter
which players are on the ﬂoor,

freshmen and inexperienced play-

ers will get playing time.

Panthers look to keep
bowl hopes alive

Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

A loss to ‘Louisville on Saturday

could cost the Pitt football team

a bowl game. .

' IfPitt (4-5, 2-2 Big East) wants
to guarantee itself a trip to the
postseason, the Panthers need
to win their ﬁnal three games,
starting with their game against
the Cardinals (5-4, 3-1 Big East)
in Louisville.

The Panthers are two wins
from reaching bowl eligibility, but
6-6 teams can only be chosen for
bowl games after every team with
a winning record has already been
selected. .

“These guys want to win, and I
want them to have an opportunity
to go to a bowl game,” Pitt head
coach Todd Graham said. “Who

‘ knows what is going to happen?

Our single focus is to beat Louis-

ville and then ‘go on to the next‘

the Bearcats to come back from a
10-point deﬁcit. Pitt has struggled
to hold on to leads all season and
has had difficulty. ﬁnding consis-
tency. While the Panthers looked
solid defeating South Florida and
Connecticut.44-.17 and 35-20, re-

spectively, they s’uﬁ’ered'losses-am

in the games following both con-
tests. , * . .

Currently, the Panthers are
2-2 in conference play. Ci_ncinnati
leads "the conference with a 3-0
Big East record, and Louisville
sits in second place at 3-1. Rut-
gers, West Virginia, Connecticut
and Pitt each have two Big East
losses.

The Cardinals are just a week
removed from upsetting then-No.

plays, much like Cincinnati quar-
terback Zach Collaros.

Pitt redshirt junior defensive
back’ jarred Holley described
Bridgewater as “poised.”

“He’s a phenomenal athlete,”
Holley said. “He makes great
reads back there, and he has a
good arm. That’s one guy we’re
really_going to be focused on.”

At Louisville, Pitt will face the‘

conference’s top defense. The
Cardinals hold opponents to 18.3
pointsand 322 yards per game on
average.

“Coach [Charlie] Strong does
a tremendous job,” Graham said.
“Our guys understand we have a
lot to play for, and you never know
what is going to happen in-this
league.” V‘  ‘

To achieve their ﬁrst road vic-
tory, the Panthers need to limit

turnovers and play disciplined’

football. They were hurt by turn-
overs and penalties in the loss to
Cincinnati.

“We talk about how we play
as Pitt men —— we have to be re-
lentless as far as toughness, and
disciplined in the effort we give,”
Graham said. “We have pressures,
but as long as you keep the ball
and don’t give it to the other team,
then that’s a good play. We need to
eliminate those mistakes.”

Saturday will be the last home ‘A’

and senior defensive tackle Gre

Scruggs said he doesn’t want to be

embarrassed in this last game.
“We have been through a lot,

but we just want to ride this _wave \

until the wheels fall off,” Scruggs
said in a press conference. “We
just want to go out and win this
game, but we know the challenge
we face this week against Pitts-

burgh. We remember what they,

did to us last year, so'we know we
have to be ready to play.”
The Panthers’ seniors will also

be playing withia lot on the line C

ures. Instead, he said the Panthers would
split those numbers.

In Pitt’s win over Kentucky Wesleyan,
Patterson and Gibbs both scored more than
20 points. No other player reached double
ﬁgures, but seven Panthers scored at least
four points.

“I feel like everyone knows their role,”
Patterson said. “We usually establish that
early on.” .

Pitt will face an experienced team in

East third—team recognition last season.
Aronhalt averaged 14.6 points per game last
season, and point guard Black added 12.3
points and dished out 2.9 assists a game.
Black also shot 43 percent from beyond
the arc.

The duo should provide a challenging
early—season matchup for Pitt’s experienced
backcourt of Gibbs and Woodall.
