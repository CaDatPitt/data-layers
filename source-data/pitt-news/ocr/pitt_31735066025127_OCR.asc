University
researcher
says public
trial needed

By Kim Palmiero
Stajf Writer

Dr. Herbert L. Needleman, a
Pitt researcher being investigated
for scientiﬁc misconduct by the
university, criticized what he
called an effort by the university
to have closed hearings during
the investigation.

“A university is supposed to be
an open place. The search for
truth requires sunlight and fresh
air, and it's inappropriate to have
closed hearings. The only reason
to have closed hearings is to
protect the identity of the accused
 The university should have
nothing to hide,” Needleman said.

The investigation follows an
inquiry conducted by Pitt, which
was requested by the Office of
Scientific Integrity at the National
Institutes of Health. A committee
composed of five faculty
members was chosen by George
M. Bernier Jr., M.D., dean of the
School of Medicine. The
committee will determine if
Needleman is guilty of scientiﬁc
misconduct.

Needleman, a professor of
psychiatry and pediatrics, is a
pioneer in studying the toxic
effects of low levels of lead in
children. In a controversial 1979

study, Needleman showed that

LRDC wins Mellon grant

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has awarded $620,000 to
the learning Research and Development Center to continue
research that examines how students learn to reason about both
the natural and social sciences.

The program, called “Varieties of Reasoning in the Social and
Natural Sciences” is run by directors Robert Glaser and Lauren
B. Resnick, who started the project in December 1991. During
the course of the project researchers will try to shed light on the
ways humans think in academic and social situations.

According to researchers, the program's ﬁndings will be
important in bettering the present methods schools use to
achieve a reasoning and thinking curriculum. This enables
schools to create conditions that will improve students’

The Mellon Foundation funds studies that help to build new
programs and studies in the areas of literacy and how students
think in the literate way. The series of studies in this area began
in 1989, when the foundation made several major grants to

The researchers and scholars involved in the program hope
to better understand our reasoning and thinking in both social
and academic situations, Glaser said. That will enable schools
to improve their teaching and learning curriculums.

invitation by John C. Marous,
board chairperson. Marous asked
faculty members for nominees to
fill 10 vacant seats the board will
be ﬁlling in June.

"We’ve got to go out and get
the best,” Mauch said. “Limiting
ourselves to Pittsburgh would be
like limiting our students to those
who live in Pittsburgh.”

Mauch said he nominated
Updike and Wilson, both Pulitzer
prize—winners, because of their
talent. Updike is the author of
many best-selling books, like Run
Rabbit Run, 77Je Centaur and

Witches of Eastwick. Wilson is
famous for his plays, like Fences,

which often focus on the plight
of African Americans.

Beverly Sills, in addition to
being a coloratura soprano, has
been director of the New York
City Opera since 1979. Mauch
said her administrative experience
would be valuable to the
board.

“I believe these people would
bring a wide perspective to the
board,” Mauch said.

The faculty nominations reflect
recent bylaw amendments to add
diversity to the board, which
currently consists‘ of primarily
corporate executives and state
legislators.

A board ad hoc committee
studied the board and recently
suggested that it incorporate more
diversity in race, gender and age
among its candidates for the 10
seats.

In addition to celebrities, the
nominees include presidents of
universities, union leaders,

-professors and former Student

Government Board Presidentjulie

The board will fill the vacancies
at its June 19 meeting.

Mauch said the board needs to
look for top people who care
about educational institutions and
know how to run them.

Ketchum President named Pitt VC
of development, alumni relations

By John Temple
Staﬂ“ Writer

Following a decline in alumni
donations, Pitt named the
president of a fund—raising
consulting firm to be vice
chancellor of development and
alumni relations.

Lawrence M. Weber, who will
resign as president of Ketchum
Inc. to begin his new job in May,
said he blames the economy
instead of negative public reaction
to Pitt's spending policies for the
downturn in donations.

But he added, “If there are
continued negative stories, it may
have an impact [on the willingness
of alumni to donate.l”

The Office of Development and
Alumni Relations reported a 1.4-
percent drop in alumni donations
in the last year. Total voluntary
support for the last half of 1991,
a much larger figure, was down
13.9 percent, according to The

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Kacey Gribben, an employee
of the office, said many people
are not giving this year because
of concern over the cost of
Chancellor}. Dennis O’Connor’s
installation and the renovations
of his residence and office.

But Weber, noting the lengthy
time periods between successive
renovations and installations, said
those expenditures are
insignificant in comparison to
Pitt's total budget.

“The fact that [the expenditures]
were announced publicly is a
credit to Dr. O’Connor,” he
said.

Weber said he understands the
concerns that students struggling
to pay tuition have about
university spending. He said he
recognizes that the university must
be sensitive to public opinion.

Weber, whose salary is
pending, succeeds Bruce Loessin,
who left last fall. Loessin was
paid $125,000.

As president of Ketchum Inc.,
Weber directed development
campaigns and provided cou nsel
to more than 20 of the nation’s
major universities and colleges,
although Pitt was not among
them.

O’Connor said Weber “brings
an outstanding record of expertise
and accomplishment in
international fund raising and
advancement. [With Weber] we
are planning to target even higher
levels of private support for all
our academic missions.”

Weber estimated that Pitt now
receives about $38 million
annually from donations.

Weber called the University of
Pittsburgh a challenge that he is
looking forward to after 23 years
at Ketchum.

“When I say challenge, I mean
it in a positive way, " he explained.
“Pitt is a major, comprehensive
institution with superb credentials
and an excellent administration
and faculty.”

Help available for students who suﬂerfrom omxiety CORRECTION

Experiencing anxiety is a fairly
common experience for most
people.

Usually this is tied to some real-
life event, such as an approaching
‘examination, a rejection from a
loved one or upcoming major
surgery.

Sometimes, however, people
experience severe anxiety or
panic attacks for no apparent
reason.

Although there are many
theories about anxiety and panic,
no one knows for certain what
causes these attacks.

Some believe
people are genetically
predisposed to anxiety attacks
and that the attack may be set off
by stress or allergic reactions to
certain foods or stimulants.

Others argue that the attacks
are psychological and probably
related to unresolved separation
problems, early childhood abuse
or exposure to other early
traumas.

Whatever the cause, there are
things you can do to control

more anxious because they
believe that once the anxiety
starts it will get increasingly
worse.

Some people even fear that
they will die from an anxiety
attack. Actually, anxiety tends to
come in waves.

The attack has a beginning, a
peak and a decline. Even though
the waves may recur, observing
the wavelike nature of the
emotion and anticipating the
decline will help you feel more_in
control.

In the midst of the attack your
adrenaline is likely to be racing.
You can do a lot to bring this
under control just by slowing
down your breathing.

There are many inexpensive
self—help books on anxiety that
teach breathing exercises and
other relaxation techniques that
can be used to ease the panic.
Physical activity is another way
of burning up the excess
adrenaline.

A vigorous walk can be helpful,
especially if you take along a

trusted friend who will serve as a
further distractor from the anxious
thoughts which may be feeding
the panic attack.

If the anxiety attacks are severe
and persistent, some kind of
treatment should be sought.

Medication is useful for some
anxiety disorders, but brief
psychotherapy can also be
helpful.

If you would like to talk to
someone about an anxiety
problem, call the Counseling
Center (648-7930) for an
appointment or sign up for a
stress-reduction workshop at
the Student Health Center (648-
1270).

You might also write for
information to the National
Institute of Mental Health,
Consumer Information Center,
Dept. 593T, Pueblo, Colo., 81009.
Ask for their booklet called Useful
Information on Panic.

With some help and some
concentrated effort, you should
be able to better understand and
manage your anxiety.

Heinz 57  

Pitt choir director works to ‘

By Heather York
For T be Pitt News

The director of the Heinz
Chapel Choir wants to inspire its
members to do to its audience
what Heinz ketchup does to a
hamburger. V

“To ﬁnd that variety of tempos,
style and balance, combined
with something challenging and
rewarding that will please the
choir, the audience and myself,
takes a lot of time,” said John
Goldsmith, director ofthe choir.

Goldsmith directs 57 students
through the careful blend of
music in each of the four concert
programs presented each year.

Goldsmith has been director

of the Heinz Chapel Choir for.

the past two years.

He is also a lecturer in the
music department , and a
professional singer. Most of his
time, however, is spent working
with the choir, which performs
four programs a year.

In addition to the spring
concert, Goldsmith is now
working on the group’s trip to
Europe in April, organizing_ the

~ details and raising money.

The softspoken director grew
up on a dairy farm in Columbus,
Ohio, where, he said, music was
always a part of his life. “In
school, at church, ev_erything——
my life has been centered around
music,” he said. .

He attended Capital University
in Columbus, Ohio. After
graduation he became the first
“rookie out of college” to hold a
high-school choral position’ in
Columbus’ public-school system.

“The rewards at the public-.
school level are the greatest
because. you take the young
singers the farthest,” he said.
“To getyour choir to sing in

tune at the high-school level is a V

great accomplishment.”

   

 

John Goldsmith is a lecturer in Pitt's music department.

Goldsmith taught high school
for four years before returning
to college to earn his master’s
degree.

He also spent a year at the
New England Conservatory in
Boston before finishing his
studies at the Westminster Choir

College in Princeton, NJ. After .

earning his master’s, Goldsmith
taught music on the collegiate
level for a few years.

Goldsmith is also a
professional counter tenor,
which is the equivalent ‘of a
male tenor. It’s a rare voice in
America, he said.

While performing Handel's
Messiah at Ohio State University,
Goldsmith met his future wife,
Elaine, who was also a
soloist.

After teaching at several
colleges, Goldsmith moved to

Houston, Texas, to direct a
professional chorus, the Concert
Chorale of Houston. The high
point of Goldsmith’s career, he
said, came in Houston, when
famous Swedish. choral
conductor Eric Erickson game
to direct his choir and

_ commended Goldsmith-on how

wlelllo-prepared his singers were.

“I’ve had directing experience
at every level, and there are
advantages for all,” Goldsmith
said. “Musically, you accomplish
a lot more at the professional
level, but personally the public-

"school and college levels deliver

more satisfaction.”

Goldsmith left Houston to
come to Pitt, where he became
the first professional to direct

_ the S4-year~old Heinz Chapel

Choir. It had previously been
directed by graduate students,

inspire’ audiences

. Jason Hillman/The l’itt News

but the administration felt it
needed a better sound,
Goldsmith said.

“We’ve come a long way in
two and a half years,” he said.
“I’m very proud of what we’ve
accomplished.”

Of the 57‘ students in the
Choir. only 
Goldsmith said.’ “Most o’“r"'th*2é"
people who join have been
trained in high school, although
some students audition with no
prior musical background. '

Goldsmith has turned the
concert choir into an a cappella
choir, which means it sings
without accompaniment. “That
is the ultimate goal for a choir:
to be able to sing in tune without
any keyboards or instruments
to help,” he said.

The Heinz Chapel Chfoirlm

performs all styles of music,-

from Renaissance to jazz, sacred
to secular, Goldsmith said. The
students practice twice a week
and learn all the music by rote.

For the European tour, the.

program must be memorized,
which may be harder now but
produces a better sound,
Goldsmith said.

“Sometimes we win a great
musical battle, and sometimes
we don’t,” Goldsmith said. “But
usually we are winning
nowadays."

Goldsmith said many children
grow up listening to recordings
in which every note is produced
perfectly in a studio.

“lt’s hard to get a live
performance perfect. Kids who
grow up listening to all this
perfection may be disappointed
by a live a cappella concert," he
said. “My view is that we are

 taking great works out ofa huge
‘ museum of choral music and

displaying them live. lt’s a
wonderful experience to hear it
live.”

The next time the “works”
will be displayed is March 22,
when the Heinz Chapel Choir
performs with The Juniata
College Choir. The choir’s spring
performance will be on April
12. Both performances are free
to the public and are held in
Heinz- C~hapel. W,

On April 27 the choir will
begin, a three—week tour of
Europe, performing in.churches
in Germany, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, Liechtenstein
and Switzerland. »

“Raising the money is the hard
part," Goldsmith said. “Some
students have had to take out
personal loans."

The cost for each student is
$2,500, and through fund-
raising the choir hopes
tdnpdt $I,OOO_toward each
trip. "

_ For The Pm News "

Involvement in organization;
and activities at the collegiate
level figures heavily in the

(transition process from college

student to working professional,
said Corporate Recruitment
Specialist Mike Robinson at a
seminar sponsored by the
National Society of Black
Engineers on Thursday.
Involvement in fraternities,
clubs, social
organizations and working
internships has just as much

influence on one’s chances of

finding a job as good grades, he
said.

“Vie for the best grade possible,"
he said, “but what you learn in
the books doesn't necessarily
transfer to the practical hands-
on. Work that job, and see what
applies and what doesn’t.”

Robinson is a staff specialist at
the Pittsburgh branch of Inroads,
a company devoted to career
development in business
and industry for talented
minorities.

Robinson emphasized the value
of viewing one’s college career
as a type of preprofessional
training arena that offers a wider

spectrum of activities and
opportunities than is popularly
perceived by the students.
Involvement in any of these
activities will help develop skills
that are prized in the professional
environment.

“College is the proving grou rid,”
he said, “and the first step to
demonstrating leadership
potential.”

Robinson also detailed five
steps necessary to ensure a
smoother transition to the work
place:

0 A self-assessment of one’s
career preparation both in school
and out.

THE PIITINEWS, Tuesday,"March 3, 1992

0 A detailed exploration of
one’s chosen discipline.

0 An establishment of one’s
career objectives.

0 A thorough investigation of
potential employers.

0 A self-assessment of steps
taken and success in one’s job-
hunt.

Robinson encouraged students
to learn to take risks now, while
still relatively insulated and
protected. ' ,

Through that process, he said,
students learn to behave in a
different and distinctive manner
in the workplace, an aspect of
corporate life that is helpful to

According to Robinson, there
are other skills students should
master to help succeed in the
workplace.

These include the ability to
allocate time, money and other
resources and the ability to
understand and use technology.
He said students should also be
able to evaluate, process
and use information and also
have the ability to work with
others.

Robinson also said that
America’s current economic woes
could be resolved in the future
through heavy minority
involvement in the corporate,
sector.

“CorporateAmerica nowsuffers

Corporate America is now coming

we turn all of this around?’ The
answer will rest heavily on people

From beer-truck driver to tenured ressor:

By Kellie Burkett
Staff Writer

Looking through Lee Gutkind’s
résumé, you will ﬁnd: “D—average”
high-school student, Coast Guard
personnel, beer-truck driver, shoe
salesman, part-time student,
college graduate and, most
notably, renowned author and
full-time professor.

Gutkind, Pitt’s only full-time
tenured professor without an
advanced degree, has been part
of the university’s English
department for “about two
decades.” Prior to this time
Gutkind had been associated with
Pitt; however his association had
been with the College of General
Studies and his status was non-
traditional student.

“I found my high-school
atmosphere very oppressive,”
Gutkind said about his local alma
mater. “Reading was what I loved
to do, and it was easier for me to
skip my classes and read what I
wanted to. The only time I felt
safe was when I had a book in my
hands.”

In an August 1990 interview
with The New Yorle Times,
Gutkind said thatupon graduation
he applied to “the three worst
colleges in the [Pittsburgh] area.
When even they rejected me, I
joined the Coast Guard.”

Gutkind said it was at this time
in his life that he started traveling
and began realizing that he
wanted “to create things other
people could read.”

Upon discharge, however,
Gutkind found himself stuck in

“dead-end” jobs: truck driver and
salesman. Soon he was accepted
into Pitt’s CGS program.

“When I started college, I found
the atmosphere to be captivating, ”
Gutkind said. “I’m sure going to
school at night isn’t for everyone,
but there couldn’t be a better
program in Pittsburgh — in
Western Pennsylvania — than the
College of General Studies."

Since that time Gutkind has
written five books, one
documentary film and has been
the recipient of various awards,
including CGS’s first Distinguished
Alumni Award.

His first book, Bilee Fever, was
inspired by his “hippie days” in
the 19705, when he traveled the
country on a motorcycle.

“I developed a different idea of
cyclists than most people,”
Gutkind said. “There was
something romantic and dramatic
about the way they just drugged
into a town and then just got on
their bikes and drugged back off.

“These people were indep-
endent, self-reliant, spontaneous,”
Gutkind said. “This theme of
independence has been followed
throughout most of my books.”

Gutkind is referring to his book
about the self-reliant National
League umpires, The Best Seat in

Baseball, But You Have To Stand, '

and the transplant patients,
surgeons, nurses and specialists
who are illustrated in Many
Sleepless Nights, a book that took
four years of research. It won him
the American Heart Association’s
Blakeslee Award and the
American Council on

Transplantation’s Meritorious
Service Award.

“The world of organ transplants
are full of independent, single-
minded, obsessed people,”
Gutkind said. “These people have
two months or two years to live.
They know someone has to die
so they can live. They’re all alone
against fate and against chance.
Gutkind says this independent
obsession also extends to
transplant doctors and nurses.

“Dr. Thomas Starzl [Pittsburgh’s
famous liver—transplant surgeon]
is the most obsessive person I’ve
ever met. He lives, eats, breathes
liver transplants 24, 48, 72 hours
a day,” Gutkind said.

This self-reliance theme ties in A

with the College of General
Studies, Gutkind said. CGS
students usually have a family, a
job and very little support. Non-
traditional students have to be
strong, independent people to
make it to graduation.

“The only people I’ve ever met
that were stronger than
independent adults were kids,”
Gutkind said. “Kids with health
problems and mental-health
problems are the most courageous
people I’ve ever met.”

Gutkind researched children
with illness for his book One
Children’s Place, Inside a
Chz'ldren’s Hospital, and is
currently researching mentally ill
children for a book that should
be released next year. "The unique
and special thing about kids is
they hurt, then cry. Five minutes
later the hurt is gone and so is the
crying,” Gutkind said. “Even child-

As for his teaching, Gutkind
said the most disappointing factor
with writing students is that they
rely too much on learning through
models and put less emphasis on
learning through read_ing. _
“More and more students are
interested in writing and not in

low levels of lead can retard the
mental growth of children. At
issue is whether or not Needleman
“massaged” the data in the study,
which strongly inﬂuenced the
establishment of regulatory laws
regarding acceptable levels of
lead.

The inquiry and investigation
by Pitt is only the latest in a series
of accusations which were
brought about chieﬂy by doctors

0 Claire Ernhart and Sandra Scarr.

Needleman charged that the
attempts to discredit him are
coming from the lead industry to
try and silence his work, which
could cost both the lead industry
and the government billions of
dollars.

Both Ernhart and Scarr attest to
having had ties to the lead
industry.

 ‘g § 0 4 THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Tuesday, March 3, 1992

After being infommed of the
investigation by Pitt, Needleman
wrote a letter to Bemier which
asked the committee to do four
things: to furnish him with a set
of charges that define his
misconduct, to open the hearings,
to allow him to confront Emhart
and Scarr and that statisticians,
epidemiologists and to ask
environmental scientists to join
in the process.

Needleman said he has
received no response from
Bemier.

Bernier was not available for
comment.

Needleman maintained that
another reason the university
should have open hearings is
because the U.S. government
funded his 1979 study.

“This is federal money. My
research was supported by a lot

of money from the U.S.
government, and that's taxpayer
money, and taxpayers have the
right to know what’s going on.
Besides which, and to me this is
most important, the university is
supposed to be a place where
you look for truth, and the way
that you look for truth is in the
daylight," he said.

Rosenburg of the Office of
Research and Integrity, the
university’s lawyer. Rosenburg
declined to comment about the
possibility of having closed
hearings.

The committee which will
investigate Needleman is
comprised of faculty members at
Pitt and were selected by Bemier.

The five members are William
W. Cooley, professor of admin-
istrative and policy studies in the
School of Education and research
associate in the Learning Research
and Development Center; Patrick
Doreian, professor of sociology;
Robert B. McCall, a professor of
psychology and director of the
Oﬂice of Child Development;
Oscar M. Reinmuth, professor and
chairperson of neurology; and
Herbert S. Rosenkranz, who is a
professor and chairperson of the
environrnental- and occupational-
health department in the
Graduate School of Public
Health. .

Needleman said the inquiry
prior to the investigation failed to
show any evidence of “plagiarism,
falsiﬁcation or fraud, but they
couldn't rule out scientific
misconduct."

Needleman charged that the
inquiry panel did not consider
relevant information pertaining
to the the 1979 study and its
history. In a letter to Bemier
dated Jan. 9, Needleman
addressed this issue.

He said that among the
information not considered
relevant is “cross tabulations and
regressions which directly
addressed the charges that Scarr/
Ernhart placed against me.”
Needleman said he did not receive
a response from Bemier.

“The keystone of scientific
inquiry investigation is
thoroughness, and how they can
say they were thorough when
they ignored the stuff I gave them
is beyond me,” Needleman
said.

James Lieber, Needleman’s '

lawyer, said Needleman’s case
has important ramifications for
the scientific community. “I think
that the whole thing is unusual

. and frightening. A lot of scientists

are worried about this because if
Needleman is found guilty, it
may cause other scientists to be
afraid to do new things,-” Lieber
said.

Opportunities for women

Equality between men and women has been a feminist
goal for many years. Women’s equal-rights advocates in
the last 20 years propelled opportunities for women in all
areas of life — the home, law, medicine, business and
education. Supposedly, sex discrimination is no longer an
issue when listening to the national debate over civil
rights.

However opportunities do not always transfer into
significant societal changes. Also, when considering the
distance women must travel for equality, women have a
long way to go.

Recently, a highly publicized report on education,
particularly the primary levels, stated that a clear and
present sex bias exists. Male‘ students receive a better
quality of educational opportunities, the study
demonstrated.

This fact is painfully obvious — inadequate education
‘has been a basic characteristic fueling unequal treatment
of individuals in the United States. Another study showing
the unequal treatment of women is redundant.

For example, few women enter the traditional sciences.

At Penn State University only 14.4 engineering students

' are women. Roughly three-fourths of Carnegie Mellon’s

engineering undergraduates are male, while approximately
78'percent of Pitt’s undergraduate engineers are male.
Men dominate the field.

Fortunately, educators are developing affirmative steps
to erase this gender difference. _

Penn State Associate Professor Patricia Farrell helped
create the “MS. WIZ” program to bring out greater
participation in the sciences. The program, funded by
National Science Foundation funds, allows fifth- and
sixth-grade female students to visit Penn State’s main
campus for two weeks during the summer. ‘

Lastjuly over 1,200 applicants from Pennsylvania tried
out for 80 openslots. During the two—week stint, the
young women worked in laboratories, and educators
addressed sex biases many women may encounter entering

the sciences.

In yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Farrell
commented, “We talk about if your boyfriend thinks
you’re too smart and you’re a nerd, how do you deal with
that  We’re not therapists  but talking about [sex biases]
with other girls allows them to say, ‘This is what my dream
is’ and not have anybody laugh at them.”

Farrell is targeting women at the fifth- and sixth-grade
level of because studies indicatestudents begin debating
career choices around this time. This makes sense-.
Affirmative—action programs should start early rather than
target an adult population. ~

In recent years, affirmative-action programs have come
under attack for hurting white men. However equality is
the only real goal of affirrnative—acti on programs. Educators
must recognize the favoritism of whites or men in
education. Only then will equality be realized.

Vegetarian choice loealtbyforenvironment

They say that the way to a
man’s heart is through his
stomach, but how does one get
to a man’s stomach? Hopefully
through his brain.

Few Americans contemplate the
impact that their meaty diets have
on the global community and the
environment, but it’s time that
they did. Here are a few facts to
ponder next time you’re about to
sink your teeth into that sirloin at
Ponderosa. _

Each year, 20 million people
die of malnutrition. If Americans
reduced their meat consumption
by a mere 10 percent, an
additional 60 million people could
be fed. Why?

In nature, the food web is
divided into trophic levels, the
“links” of the food chain. Plants
occupy the lowest rung. As the
familiar story goes, herbivores
eat the plant organisms of the
lower levels, and carnivorous
animals, in turn, eat them.
Ultimately, evolution’s supreme
predator, man, sits triumphantly
at the top of the pyramid.

But all is not as rosy as it may
seem. With each jump up the
food ladder, approximately 90
percent of the energy and
nutrients contained in organisms
of the level immediately below is

lost. This means that upper—level .

predators must work even harder
to get the energy and nutrients
they need to survive.

For most carnivores, this
struggle presents a big problem,
and it is ultimately a limiting
the growth of
populations. But for humans, long
graduated from the hunter/
gatherer stage, consumption of
another animal is no more difficult
than uttering, “Big Mac, please."

The fair distribution of the
planet’s resources dictates that
this ravenous consumption of
meat cannot continue. Because
the food chain is only 10 percent
efficient, 80 percent of all corn
raised in the U.S. is eaten not by
people, but by livestock. For oats,
the percentage jumps to 95.

   
 

As a result, 56 percent of all
U.S. farmland is devoted to cattle
production. Eighty—ﬁve percent
of U.S. topsoil loss is attributable
to cattle production. Two
thousand, five hundred gallons
of water and 16 pounds of grain
are needed tojproduce just’ one
pound of edible beef. ‘

When the transportation of

Gary
Knapick

livestock, their feed and their
products are taken into account,
approximately 78 calories must
be expended by burning fossil
fuels to put one calorie of beef on
your table.

Each yearthe U.S. imports 300
million pounds of beef from South '
American countries. Here in the
U.S., 260 million acres of
forestland have been cleared to
produce the crops that ultimately
support our meat—centered diet.
In South America, the situation is
similar, only it is the precious and
rapidly disappearing rainforests
that are being cleared. Fifty—ﬁve
square feet of Latin American
land are required to produce a
single patty of beef.

Every hour 660,000 animals are
killed for the appeasement of our
population's meaty appetite.
These animals frequently live and
die in conditions of unthinkable
cruelty.

Veal, for example, is produced
by making young calves anemic.
How is the animal made anemic?
It is conﬁned for its entire life in
a small pen, released only on the
day that it is to be killed.

Cattle feed regularly includes
shredded newspaper, cement
dust, sawdust and processed
sewage. In addition, the
occupation of slaughterhouse
worker has the highest worker-
turnover and on-the-job injury
rates in the country. ,

Levels of chlorinated
hydrocarbons from pesticide
residues in meat-eating mothers’
milk are 35 times higher than
levels found in the breast milk of
vegetarian mothers.

In the U.S., 99 percent of
mothers’ milk contains significant
traces of the banned, carcinogenic
pesticide DDT, which still haunts
our country’s soil. By contrast,
only 8 percent of vegetarian
mothers have similar levels of the
pesticide in their breast milk.

As omnivorous and intelligent
creatures, we have the ability to
make choices about what we eat.
As consumers, we have the power
to change the way our lands and

Panthers set selasonl-biglxget blasted by N 0. 4 Ohio St.

By Jeremy Swarbrick
S M17‘ Writer

Undermanned and
overmatched, the Pitt men’s
gymhastics team traveled down
to Columbus for a meet with the
nationally ranked Ohio State
Buckeyes, not expecting to win
but hopinglto score high as a
team. Pitt got what it asked for.

The Panthers scored a season-
high 266.10 points, but they
finished a distant second to the
powerful Ohio State squad,
presently ranked No. 4 in the
country. The Buckeyes tallied a
total score of 281.10 points for
the meet. Ironically, Pitt ran offits
best score of the year against its
best competition of the year but
still managed to lose by a wide
margin.

Although they compiled their
best team score of the year, the
fact remains that the Panthers

Buckeyes, as was the case with
Temple the week before,
thoroughly overmatched. This
Panther squad, although it has
been hampered severely by
injuries, is a solid one with plenty
of experience and leadership, but
for the past two weeks it has
been competing against squads
that are way above its caliber.

“When we made the schedule
up, I didn’t count on Genero
(Severino, Pitt’s top gymnast)
getting hurt,” head coach Frank
D’Amico said in defense of his
team. “l-Ie can raise our scores
seven or eight points.”

From the start it was apparent
that this meet was going to be a
long one for Pitt. Ohio State
outscored the Panthers in the
floor exercises by almost two
points, 47.10 to 45.40. On the
pommel horse, Pitt was plagued
by sloppy performances,
receiving low scores and
dropping that event, 45.40 to

 

according to assistant coach Jim
Lear. But the list of ECAC
competitors is deep and strong.

At Notre Dame, juniorJen Hrach
placed eighth in the 5,000 meters
with a personal-best time of
17:52.65. Miler Judy Facey
ﬁnished seventh in her mile
sections and in the top 14 overall
with a time of 5:15.].

Most of the remainder of the
team spent the weekend resting

42.20. '

Yet things still did not improve
for the Panthers. Ohio State ran
off impressive first-, second- and
third-place performances on the
still rings, scoring 47.85 points
compared to Pitt’s 45.10. In the
vault, the Buckeyes again
thumped the Panthers, scoring a
45.90-43.95 victory and all but
ending any chances of a Pitt rally.

In the next event, the parallel
bars, Ohio State again shut out
Pitt’s gymnasts, ﬁnishing one-two-
three and earning 46.75 points
for the effort. Pitt scored 44.70
points to fall even further behind.
In the ﬁnal event, the Buckeyes
completed their sweep of the
Panthers with a resounding 48.10
to 44.75 win, their largest margin
of victory in any single event.

Although no Pitt gymnasts
placed in the top three in any of
the six events or in the all-around,
a few of the Panthers managed
fourth place, missing third places

Yale University.

Several members will be
especially busy. Sophomore Kim
Blair is a four~event qualiﬁer,
participating in. the 55-meter
hurdles, the 200 meters, the 400
meters and as a member of the
4x400 relay. Blair was also on last
year’s relay team.

Joining Blair as four-event
qualiﬁers are Ronise Crumpler

by only tenths of a point. Senior
Mike Englert scored 9.05 points
on the vault, and senior co-captain
Dave Bausmith earned 54.65. Also
placing fourth was senior co-
captain Stuart Yoss, who scored
9.00 points on the pommel horse.
Yoss’ all-around score of 53.50,
although _not good enough to
place, was a career high.

“Stuart is doing one hell of a
job,” D’Amico said. “He was a
walk-on and worked his way on
to a scholarship. He has improved
about 20 points in his all-around
since his first year.”

The top ﬁnisher on the Pitt
squad in the floor exercises was
Bausmith with 9.3 points. Since
the early loss of Severino,
Bausmith has been Pitt’s most

Bausmith also led Pitt on the still
rings (9.40) and the high bar
(9.50) and ﬁnished second on the
team in the vault with 8.80 points.

‘Pitt’s next meet will be on

    

Saturday at the Great Lakes
Championships. Competing with
the Panthers will be William and
Mary College, Radford College,
Kent State University, Navy,Jarnes
Madison and Wisconsin. This
meet, along with the upcoming
Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Conference Championships, will
be very important for the Panthers,
who are looking to qualify for the
NCAA Eastern Regionals later this
month. There are 30 teams in the
East region, and only the top 10
qualify for the NCAAs. Right now
Pitt is ranked somewhere between
10 and 12. A good showing at the
Great Lakes and ECAC
Championships could leapfrog
Pitt into the regionals. After the
regional ﬁnals, the top four teams
go to the NCAA National
Championships. U
“We are probably pretty close
right now,” D’Amico said. “The
competition should be pretty
close in the next few weeks.”

The smell of freshly cut grass, the

Pitt teammates look to improve on last season's 15-30 record in coach Jackson's first year.

Women ’s track pr

glistening of dew on the ﬁeld, the sounds
of balls cracking off bats and distant
chatter from players are signs that conjure
up images of our national pastime: baseball.
For the University of Pittsburgh Panther
baseball team, the season is right around
the corner. '
Second-year head coach Mark Jackson
said he is excited about the upcoming
season, and he feels he’s got the team on
the right track. “The team is more

competitive [and] hard nosed, and they‘

want to be successful,” he said.

Jackson came to Pitt from Point Park
College, where he had coached for eight
years. At Point Park he compiled a 291.-5
record. .

Jackson accomplished many things in
his first full season at Pitt. The team took
a step forward by finishing I5-30, winning
twice as many games as in the prior two
years. Jackson’s aggressive style of play
also proved successful, as Pitt stole 121
bases, 70 more than Pitt’s previous record.

“Last year we took a step in the right
direction, but not as big of a step as I
would have liked,”- Jackson said.

However there is a new outlook for Pitt
this season, and the team has set new
goals. “This is the 1992 team, not the teams
in the past. This is the players’ team, and
they have to believe in themselves, ”Jackson
said.

“The team sat down and voted on team
goals, and we set the goals pretty high. But
I feel the goals are achievable,” junior
Brad Reese said.

Reese said some of the goals were to
play better in the Big East and to play

Gymnczsts garner second in competition with P5 U, I UP

By John Labriola
Sta_[fIVr1'Ler

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — The
Lady Panthers gymnastics team
traveled east to meet up with the
Lady Lions of Penn State
University and the Indians of
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania. Pitt placed second

- in Sunday’s competition with a

total of 185.05 points, while PSU
took first with a total of 190.35.
IUP finished last with 181.50.
The Lady Panthers always seem
to enjoy the trip to “Happy Valley”
— not because of the scenery on
the drive up, but because they
always try to make a good
showing before the Penn State
crowd. As a result of all of the
illness and injuries that the Lady
Panthers have ‘had to endure,
Sunday night’s performance was
extremely important.
‘ “We want to go up there and
look good,” Gina Venezia said.
“We want to do our best and
leave a good impression.”
“I like to think that they give a

I better performance going up

against better teams,” head coach
Debbie Yohman said, “because
you compete to the level of your
competition. When you compete
against a team like Penn State, I
think you are just a little bit
smarter. 1
‘‘That’s why I think that it’s
important to compete against
teams that are at your level and
better rather than setting up your

schedule for the wins, although '

we could use a couple more
wins. Setting up your schedule
strictly for wins is not going to
train your people to be the best
that they can be,” Yohman added.

The Lady Panthers did as

Yohman believed they would for
the entire competition; they
performed smartly. From the
onset of the meet, they relied on
their cool heads and stamina to
get them through their routines.

The Lady Panthers started out
the competition on the uneven
parallel bars. Pitt’s bar squad
turned in strong performances
and earned 45.80 points. Pitt’s
bar routines were extremely clean
and flowed amazingly well for all
of the troubles the team has had
with illness. Strong bar
performances came from Kristin
Brown (9.45), Jen Butkovich
(9.50), Jeannie Vecchio (9.20),
Karen Jorgensen (9.10) and
Venezia (8.75). '

“The thing that I was pleased
about was even on bars, even
with the mistakes, the kids kept it
clean and kept going where they
could have gotten sloppy, loose
or fallen off,” Yohman said.

The Lady Panthers’ next event
was the vaulting exercises. Pitt’s
vaults have been coming along
this season. The Pitt vaulting
squad turned" in strong, clean,
well-executed vaults on Sunday,
but the scores somehow did not
seen to resemble the caliber of
vaults that Pitt displayed.

"‘I couldn’t see the sides of the
vaults today, but they weren’t as
bad as the scores indicated,”
Yohman said. “Vaulting —scores
were just a bit lower overall for
everyone on all of the teams.”

The squad tallied 45.80 points
with strong vaults coming from
Brown (8.85), Vecchio (8.95),
Alisha Friend (8.95), Tracy Jung
(9.05) and Venezia (9.55).

Sunday’s competition ushered
in Venezia’s new vault, which
she nailed solidly. Venezia’s 9.55

places her third in vaulting in
Pitt’s record books behind Lisa
Shirk’s two 9.65s.

I’ve been working on that vault
since last August,” Venezia said.
“I was a little nervous about
competing it. I knew that I could
do it; it was just a matter of doing
it.”

The Lady Panthers’ third event
found them on their strongest
event, the floor exercises. As
always the Lady Panthers turned
in fine performances, but they
still had a few problems to
contend with. The floor squad
totaled 46.95 points for their
efforts.

Pitt’s gymnasts have been going
through an on-again, off-again
routine with injuries and the flu.
Since the floor exercises take the

most endurance and are the most

energetic, the Lady Panthers have

been doing an awful lot of huffing
and puffing. Still, through all of
the heavy breathing, the Lady
Panthers pulled out top
performances from Brown (9.55),
Vecchio (9.50), Jorgensen (9.50),
Venezia (9.45) and Jung (8.95).
According to Yohman, Sunday’s
competition was the best floor
routine that Venezia has given,
although she still has some
problems that can be cleaned up.
Yohman said she feels that
Venezia can get two tenths back
on that routine, three tenths ifshe
adds anotheribonus. If Venezia
adds the front somersault-to-
double back flip to her routine,
that will give her the extra bonus.
“We took that trick out this
week because of stamina,”
Yohman said. “Her knees were
bothering her, and if she can’t
practice it, we’re not going to let

her compete it. She has been
with us for four years now, and
she knows that we don’t chance
things like that. We don’t want to
chance a fall, and we don’t want
to chance an injury.

“If she wants to do it bad
enough, she’ll work it with her
bad knee,” Yohman added.

The final ‘event for the Lady
Panthers was the balance beam,
which has been their weakest
event this season. The effects of
the flu showed up again during
the beam performances.

Out of the six beam
performances for Pitt, two
competitors did not fall from the
beam. Pitt received 44.95 points
for their efforts, with strong
performances coming from‘

evenezia (9.65), Brown (9.50),

Vecchio (8.65), Friend (8.60) and
Butkovich (8.55).

“Uacksonl has turned this team
around 360 degrees,” Reese said.

This year’s squad has many
new faces as a result of Jackson’s
25 new recruits. “There is a lot
more talent on this team than last
year,” Jackson said.

Pitt will practice 50 players,
which is about 10 more than a
normal Division I school,
according to Jackson.

“With so many players, it makes
it difficult to decide who will
play. Some players will be
redshirted; others won’t be able
to play,’’ Jackson said.

Pitt will take as many as 40

;,players to Florida next month,

but it can only dress 25 players
during Big East Conference play.

With all ofthe talent this season,
Jackson said there would be more
competition at positions and more

depth on the bench.

“Coach Jackson brought in a
lot of new people, players he
feels that could play under his
system,” sophomore infielder
Scott Rosen said.

“I am excited about this team.
There is a much better attitude
and work ethic this year," Rosen
said.

Rosen saidJackson is an equal-
opportunity coach, and how
much you play depends on how
well you are playing.

Reese, who started 39 games

last year at second base, said that ,

nothing is guaranteed.

“There is a lot of competition
on this team, and everyone has to
play hard to hold their positions,
” Reese said.

There are a lot of key players
returning.

was fourth in hitting (.296) and

RBIs (20), will catch and
sometimes fill in as the designated
hitter.

Another sophomore, Greg
Christman, will prove versatile in
the lineup, Christman hit .321
while playing both infield and
outfield last year.

Reese will again prove valuable
to the Panthers.

Last season Reese had a .954
fielding percentage, while hitting
.274 (with 8 doubles) and swiping
15 bases. Reese said he is unsure
if he will play second or shortstop
this year.

Other key returnees are juniors
Ralph McNelly (.254 BA, 21 SB)
and Bryan Henne (.306 BA, 25
RBI).

Last year’s strength was offense.
The Panthers hit .270 overall,
.282 in the Big East.

“Last year we were respectable
offensively, but we could be a
much better offensive team,”

Jackson said.

“\X/e’re capable of hitting .300.”

Where the Panthers are likely
to see the most improvement is
the pitching staff.

Last year’s team’s earned-run
average of 8.35 was a laugher
compared to their opponents’ 5.24
ERA.

The leading returning pitchers

appear to be right-handed hurler
Chris Wittgartner, Rob Hanawalt,
Mickey Vincent and Dennis
Terzich. -

Allegheny Junior College
transfers Lance Kwasniewski and
Bill Junker are also expected to
make contributions to the pitching
staff.

“A lot of injuries hurt us last
year, but I don’t think pitching is
going to hold us back this season,”
Vincent said. J

“Necessary changes have been
made. Now there are new people
and more depth.”

Not only are there new faces
among the players, but Jackson
also brought new assistant
coaches.

JeffMinick joins Pitt this season
as a full—time assistant coach.
Minick comes from Point Park,
where he played and coached
under Jackson.

Jim Leitera is a volunteer
assistant who also coached under
Jackson at Point Park.

Joining ‘him is volunteer
assistant coach Dave Aromatorio,
who also teaches at Pitt.
Aromato-rio helps with the
pitching staff.

The Panthers will head to sunny
Jacksonville, Fla., on March 8 to
begin their season.

my best term in college - I loved it!”
