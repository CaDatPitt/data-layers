No Plans Yet
For ‘80 Race

By RICHHARRY
Pitt News Staff Writer

John Connally of Texas took
time off from cross-country
stumping for the Republican
Party Wednesday to talk with
reporters in the Cathedral of
Learning Office of Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs
Bernard Kobosky.

The press briefing with about
a dozen local reporters touched
on topics ranging from the
current United Mine Workers
strike to President Carter’s
handling of the David Marston .
affair.

But the first question asked
Connally, who has been men-
tioned as a probable GOP
Presidential candidate, cen-
tered on his political ambitions,
particularly those for 1980.

“I’m not thinking about
1980,” replied the former
Secretary of the Treasurer and
Texas governor. “I won’t
concern myself with the Presi-
dency until after this year. My
effort now is touring the country

help the state part;
organizations and the Republi-
can candidates for the govern-
orships and state legislatures. ”

The press conference pre-
ceded an evening lecture in
Benedum Hall at which Con-
nally spoke about the impact on
the U.S. of foreign govern-
mental control of resources and
the market. Connally’ was
scheduled to arrive in Kentucky
today, but bad weather condi-

tions forced him to cancel and

University's Coal Supplies ‘Dwindling'

By TOM KUKUCKA

Pitt News Staff Writer

The lingering United Mine Workers Coal strike has caused heavy

cutbacks in coal usage at the University, according to Edward

Permar, manager of energy conservation at Pitt.
“Dwindling is the word,” Permar said of the amount of coal the

University has stored away.

Permar said the University has been forced to use more expensive
fuels--gas and oil--to supplement the coal deficiency. Of the six
boiler_s that supply energy for Pitt, only three are capable of bur-
A small amount of coal is still necessary,
however, for the oil and gas run boilers to function efficiently. The
, University normally uses as much as 70 percent coal to supply the

ning gas and oil.

campus with steam heat.

Permar indicated the U.M.A. has guaranteed the University

some coal because of hospitals serviced by Pitt’s heating system.

The only buildings on campus not using the steam facilities are
. the Anthropology Building, Trees Hall, Fitzgerald Field House and

Pennsylvania Hall, Permar said.

 

Gov. Shapp has recommended the state give Pitt $10.7 million to build an
animal care and research center atop the Scaite Hall auditorium.

He said that although keeping the University heated in future

Rosenthal photo

months could get very expensive, it is not expected that University
buildings and services will be shut down.

“There has been talk (of shutting the University down),” Permar
said, “but it is very unlikelyithat would ever happen.”

“There are proposed cutbacks, but no formalized plan to accept

them,” he said.

A complete shutdown of Pitt would probably come only from a
direct order by Governor Shapp, Permar said, and would involve a
declaration of extreme emergency from the Governor’s Mansion,
which would shut down or curtail services throughout the state.

Permar said there are no intentions of creating a four-day work
week, as proposed by Allegheny County officials. Such a move
would hinder both faculty members and staff, Perma said.

He added that his office has kept Pitt officials up-to-date on all
developments in the energy situation.

“The Chancellor and some of the other administrators are kept

informed, ’ ’ Permar said.

This week has been proclaimed Energy Week by Project Paceset-
ter. Schools have been asked by the Project Pacesetter group to cut
energy use, improve curriculums related to energy and organize the
educational community to promote awareness of energy problems.

Gov. Proposes Funds  
For Pitt Animal Shelter

By CATHY FARNAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Gov. Milton Shapp recently
recommended the Commonwealth
allocate $10.7 ’million for the
construction of a four-story animal
care and research facility atthe Pitt
medical school.

Dr. Donald Cramer, chairman of
the medical school’s Animal Care
Committee said, “This facility will
improve the treatment of the
animals, the quality of our
experimentation and, most impor-
tantly, assist the school in

‘ attracting and keeping competent

researchers.’ ’

The addition to the top of Scaife
Hall Auditorium will contain
animal dwelling quarters, surgical
suites, laboratory space and
student instruction center.

Dr. Paul J. Janetta, former
committee chairman, described the
existing facilities as. “grossly
inadequate.” He pointed out that
medical schools in Hershey and at
the University of Pennsylvania
have extensive, well-equipped
buildings.

The project, drafted and planned
by the Animal Case committee,
was presented to the Governor by

ROTC Accreditation Clears CAS, Faces FAS Vote

By JIM MORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

The College of Arts and Sciences
Council has approved lim-ited
accreditation for ROTC courses and
a proposal to establish an architect-
ural studies program. The
ROTC vote was by mail ballot, and
the architecture program was
approved at yesterday’s Council
meeting. '

CAS Dean Robert Marshall
announced the results of the
ROTC ballot were seven votes in
favor and four against, with one
abstention. The proposal must now
be approved by the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Council, which
will meet Feb. 28.

If passed, the measure would

H allow ROTC students to count up to

12 credits of military ‘science
courses toward graduation. The
motion caps extensive campaigning

by ROTC cadets to persuade CAS to '

reinstate credit that was abolished
in 1968. .
The Council voted unanimously
to make the accreditation proposal
retroactive to the beginning of this

term.

In another unanimous vote, the
Council approved a new architec-
ture studies program. Doug Jones,
a graduate in architecture who will
head the program, explained that
the program is designed to provide
pre-professional preparation for
graduate study in architecture.

Jones issued to members results
of his study of the program’s
potential. Jones said there are

enough existing University courses
to give students both “a legitimate
liberal arts program and career
guidance.”

»He also .said he has received
“enthusiastic support” from facul-
ty members in various depart-
ments.

According to Marshall, Jones will
be given a “slot” in the fine arts
department. “This program can
exist with virtually no expenditure
since we are not creating a new
position but replacing people on
leave,” Marshall said.

During discussion, both Jones
and Marshall stressed that the
program’s requirements and rec-
ommended electives are both
interdisciplinary and ﬂexible, but
students will be given careful

guidance to assure adequate
training for architecture graduate
school. -

Council member Larry Epstein
expressed concern that Jones’s

recommended courses would not’

give students a sufﬁcient scientiﬁc
background. But Jones told the
Council he doesn’t believe ‘ ‘today’s
narrower definition of an architect’s
activities’ ’ requires a strong science
background.-

He also said his list of
recommended courses is “by no
means exhaustive” and could be
amended.

Marshall said the main item on
next meeting’s agenda will be
discussion of a possible business
major.

Flu Epidemic Dropping at Pitt

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The number of ﬂu victims at the
University has apparently tapered
off, according to Student Health
Service health educator Bob
LaCivita. The ﬂu situation at Pitt.
termed “near epidemic” by
LaCivita last week, has reduced
slightly from 250 to 300 students
coming to the health service daily
for treatment last week to 205
Monday, 155 Tuesday and 180
Wednesday.

“It may crop up again,” LaCivita
said, “but it has slowed down. It
may be because more people are
now treating themselves.”

The Allegheny County Health
Department diagnosed the strain of
ﬂu prevalent among young people
in the Pittsburgh area as the
Russian ﬂu, but the Health Service

lacks the facilities to obtain throat
cultures, thereby preventing it
from identifying the ﬂu.

Experts have said that probably
no vaccine will be developed to
combat the Russian ﬂu before
June. Since the health service is
treating several varieties of _ﬂu,
all-encompassing home remedies
such as over-the-counter drugs and
bedrest are being recommended.

“If a student has been sick for a
long period of time (the ﬂu
normally lasts about three days)
they should seek medical care,”
LaCivita said. “We have sent some
students to the hospital.”

In most cases, the ﬂu is not
serious enough to merit more than
increased rest. Students can obtain
ﬂyers with a list of preferred
nonprescription medicines and tips
on self-care of the ﬂu at the health

service, which is located in
Brackenridge Hall.

Russian and Victorian strains
have the same symptoms, which
include nausea, low grade fever,
dry cough, exhaustion, aches and
pains and congestion. People over
25 seem to have better resistance to
the Russian ﬂu, but people under
25 are susceptible to both.

He also criticized Carter for

Haldeman: Soviets Asked U.$.
for Joint Nuclear Hit on China
By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON——The Soviet Union once moved a massive
arsenal of nuclear missiles near its border with China and offered to
join the United States in a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the
Chinese, according to H.R. Haldeman, former White House chief of

Haldeman’s new book, “The Ends of Power,” claims that U. S.
reconnaissance photos showed 1,800 Russian nuclear missiles
groups within two miles of the Ussuri River on the Chinese border
during the 1969 Soviet-Chinese confrontation, according to ABC
-News, which said it had obtained galley proofs of the book.

The report said further that Haldeman, once President Richard
M. Nixon’s chief aide, had logged a prediction by Henry A.
Kissinger on Dec. 10, 1969, that the Soviets would attack China by

Pitt Professor Dies at 52; Taught First

Graduate Course on Black Colleges
Norman R. Dixon, professor of higher education here at Pitt, died
Monday night at Presbyterian-University hospital. He was 52 years

Dr. Dixon was an advocate of multicultural curriculums and
testing. His work involved reforms for standardized tests for racial, '
ethnic and low-economic groups and women. ‘

He taught the first graduate course on black colleges in American
higher education, generating more doctoral dissertations on black
colleges than any such course in America.

The by-laws for the committee are
being drawn up.

A chairman has yet to be picked
for the Public Affairs/ Govern-
mental Relations Committee.

The board's meeting was held in
the wake of a tuition hike approved
by the Pitt Trustees. The trustees
voted Tuesday 22-1 to increase
undergraduate tuition 7.6 percent,
or $50 more this fall. The tuition
increase is in response to Governor
Shapp’s proposed budget, revealed
last week, which does not allow for
any state funding increases for Pitt.

“I think it’s very unfortunate,”
SGB president Josh Baylson said.
“I think it’s very ironic that they
(University officials) were just
talking about increasing minority
enrollment. A tuition increase will
deny many middle class and lower
class students a college educa-
tion.”

A statement drafted by board
member Stan Galanski will be sent
from the board to Governor Shapp.
The statement is in protest of the
Shapp budget and the restrictions
placed on middle class and lower
class students.

Baylson, Galanski and board
member Dave Hesidence will travel
to Temple University this Sunday
to meet with student representa-
tives from Temple, Penn State, and
Lincoln Universities. The constitu-
tion of the Pennsylvania Student
Association of State-Related Uni-
versities is expected to be approved
at the meeting. The organization
will provide student lobbying in
Harrisburg for the state-related
universities.

In other business, the board
approved the appointment of Josie
Gagliardi as the new chairman of
the Legal Awareness Committee.
The board also voted to send two
board representatives to the
National Entertainment and Cam-
pus Activities Association con-
ference in New Orleans, and two
board representatives to
the Southeastern Inter-Fraternity’
Council conference in Atlanta. Both
conferences are scheduled concur-
rently the latter part of this month.

Pitt’s Priorities

How is it the Commonwealth can’t spare an extra dime for gen-
eral appropriations to higher education, yet has $10.7 million to
spend on a new, four-story animal care and research facility at the
Pitt medical school?

Medical professionals are notoriously good lobbyists; certainly
better than their counterparts down the hill and across Fifth

Avenue. A new research facility will no doubt be a feather in the
collective cap of Pitt’s medical school hierarchy, and it will likely

 

be quite attractive to researchers they might like to lure into the ,

Oakland complex. Governor Shapp has apparently been convinced
that the new building will be in someone’s best interests, though we
doubt he has the majority of Pitt medical students in mind—much
less the majority of students in general.

As far as the University is concerned, given the administration’s

demonstrated heirarchy of values, what could be better than a nice, '

new research facility? Research facilities are, almost invariably,
the most cost-effective investments a university can make; research
facilities mean researchers, who bring in research grants, which are,
for the most part, plowed back into more research. The cycle con-
tinues and continues to the greater glorification of Pitt’s prestige
and national standing. The rich get richer and the poor break even,
at best.

In other words, while the University is getting $10.7 million
worth of prestige and cost-effectiveness, it is getting nothing to aid
students in the battle against tuition hikes. We wonder which it
considers more important.

One argument will be, of course, that the new facility will en-
hance general medical education at Pitt, and will advance the cause
(if medical science. But what we need now is not so much better
doctors as more doctors. More doctors do not result from the con-
struction of animal shelters, whether or not they are also research
facilities.

More doctors—especially more minority doctors-- could result
from expansion of teaching facilities or from lower tuition in the
medical school. Instead, plans to lower enrollment are in the
works.

Unfortunately, tuition aid and the expansion of teaching facili-

«ties are not cost-effective or prestige-enhancing items, and there-
fore not priorities. As a result, medical students are, for a while at
least, poor relations to a collection of small creatures. Later, after
the new doctors finish shelling out their $20,000 or so for four
years, the rest of us start picking up the tab—which the University,
the good doctors and Governor Shapp have all helped to inﬂate.

Letters to the Editor

How to Support the Student Lobby

November 15, 1977, twenty-
three Pitt students traveled to our
state capital to lobby for the
passage of the state budget. We
were a part of the Task Force for
Higher Education, now the newly
formed Public and Governmental
Relations Committee. We spoke
with 30 senators and about 15
representatives who were receptive
to our plea but basically unmoved.
Pitt has a valid argument and the
legislators know it, but the forces
opposing a tax hike are much more
inﬂuential__ than those opposing a
tuition hike.

Feb. 15th the task. force was
officially made a standing commit-
tee of the Student Government
Board, and we now plan alMarch 6

lobbying trip to Harrisburg. One of
the main problems we encountered
was how to provide support behind
our lobby. The simple fact is that
the majority of Pitt students do not
vote. The primary election will be
held on May 16 and right now it is
the main thing on most of the
legislators’ minds. They will pass
the bills that will get them th

votes. —

Pitt students have a responsibi-
lity, both to themselves and to the
future of this University. This
responsibility is to register and
vote in the upcoming election. We
have the resources for one of the
most powerful lobbies in the state.
Fourteen thousand undergraduate
votes is a tremendous amount for at

legislator to contend with. The
Public and Governmental Relations
Committee will
registration drive in the near

sun the Greatest ofAII  

longer ﬂoats, the bee no longer
stings.
Age has robbed us of Muhammad

Ali. Time has stripped him of his

brilliance—his sheer, pure, spec-
tacular brilliance. But, in the end,
his vanity brought him down, too.
The kind of vanity that allowed him
to think he still could go 15 rounds
with a 24-year-old kid. The kind of
vanity that allowed him to believe
he still could turn on and off the
periods of beautiful movement,
never thinking the long minutes of
slumber to be tiring. He was wrong,
and those two brothers of classic
tragedy, time and vanity, brought
him down.

I sat and watched those ﬁnal
three minutes, hoping, but never
really expecting, aﬂurry of punches
to save the day and postpone the
inevitable. The seconds dragged,
and, during those agonizing
moments, the highlights of an
unmatched career rushed through
my head.

There was the ﬁrst Sonny Liston
ﬁght in 1964. A heavy underdog
named Cassius Clay ran amok at the
pre-ﬁght weight-in. He called
Liston the Bear, proclaimed himself
to be the Greatest and shocked fight
ofﬁcials with his bizarre, seemingly
irrational behavior. He destroyed

' Liston, and a picture of the new

champion claiming his title, hands
raised, eyes wide, lips pulled back
in a sneer, is still vivid in my mind.

Then, a second Liston ﬁght and
the infamous knockout non-punch.
One ringside observer said of the
blow that floored Liston, “It
couldn’t have crushed a grape.”

Another observer said, “That
punch could have felled an oak.”
The controversy was present—as it
always would be—but Ali was still
champion.

A new religious belief and the
hypocrisy of the boxing hierarchy
robbed Ali of three and a half years,
his prime years as an athlete,
beginning in 1967. Because of his
refusal, as a conscientious objector,
to serve in the Vietnam War, he was
not allowed to ﬁght, and was
stripped of his title without any of
the constitutionally-mandated due
process of law. He would need
seven years to regain the title.

Then came the 1970’s, and his
three wars with Joe Frazier, two of
which are, arguably, the greatest
heavyweight ﬁghts ever. It took a
ﬁghter of Frazier’s greatness to
raise Ali to heights never before
reached by a boxer. Those ﬁghts,
particularly the final one in Manila
in 1975, were monumental
struggles, epic clashes between two
giants, whose hearts could only be
matched by their stunning talents.

Together, Ali and Frazier lifted a
sometimes savage, brutal sport into
an art form, a ballet of violence.
And All proved the victor in a battle
that had no loser.

In October 1974, Ali regained his
title—and indeed it was his—when,
without telling his trainer or
manager, he devised his own
strategy to befuddle and knock out
George Foreman in the heart of
Africa.

In the last four years, All has won
millions of dollars, universal
recognition and status above that of

‘V a hero, even above that of a legend.

Even the failings of humanity have
not removed him from on high.
Three wives and an illegitimate
child‘ have done nothing to his
station. No one who ever saw Ali in
the ring really cared what he did
outside of it.

But it is all over now. Even if he

be holding a ’

1’

does make some kind of comebacgv-aw‘
which I doubt, nothing will be thew‘

same. The man who defeated
Sonny Lison twice, Joe Frazier
twice, Ken Norton twice, George
Foreman once, and numerous other
lesser ﬁghters, has lost to Leon
Spinks. But no one can ever be
champion of the world the way Ali
was. No one can ever so literally fill
the meaning of that title the way Ali
did.

Sport has lost its greatest athlete.
We have lost our greatest hero. To

- say Ali’s defeat marks an end to an?

era is not sufﬁcient. It simply marks '

an end.

Editor’s Note: This is the second of
a two-part series on backpacking.

Once your mind is set on joining
the ranks of the backpacker, you
should drag out your camping gear
and take stock of what you need.
Brace yourself—it could be quite a
shock to your check account.

The first thing you need is a pair
of hiking boots, preferably with
rubber Vibram soles. You don’t
want anything too ﬂimsy. On the
other hand, few people have any
need for heavy-duty mountain
climbing boots. Let the sales
people assist you in ﬁnding the
right boot for the kind of hiking
you’ll be doing. The price range is
wide, but count on paying at least
$40.

Don’t wait until two days before
your trip to remove your boots from
the box, only to discover they are
about as comfortableas concrete
blocks. Hiking boots must be
broken in over a long period of
time. Ill-ﬁtting or poorly broken in

boots can ruin an otherwise
well-planned trip.

You also need a backpack,
consisting of a frame and pack. The
most important things to look for in
a frame are construction and a ﬁt
that distributes weight properly.
Whether the pack itself is divided
into one large compartment or two
smaller ones is strictly a matter of
preference. Good deals start at
about $30, but name brands run at
least $50.

So much for daylight activity;
You need a warm, compact
sleeping bag. Weight is important,
so forget about the old bag you
used at summer camp years
ago—the one that weighed six
pounds and had deer and bears on
the lining.

Down bags are the most widely
used because they combine maxi-
mum warmth and minimum
weight. Synthetic insulators now
are becoming popular because they
dry out more quickly than down if
your bag happens to get wet. You
will pay a minimum of $80 for a
down bag, but will pay much less

for synthetic insulation or a
combination of the two.

Some people forego a tent, and
simply rig up a tarp. Tarps are ﬁne,
but in a real downpour you can’t
beat a good waterproof tent.
Lightweight backpacking tents that
sleep from one person to a small
family are available. A two-person
tent with rainﬂy will cost about
$100, and you can spend much
more. Cheaper tents can be found,
but they tend to collect condensa-
tion on the inside, making your bag
wet every morning.

After you buy the four items, the
ﬁnancial drain eases a bit. If you
own a down bag, you must have a
sleeping pad of foam or ensolite to
cushion you from the hard ground
and fend off the dampness. Down
is not warm if it is compressed, so
the part of the bag you lay on will
not keep out the cold.

If you want hot meals, a stove is
a must. Light backpacking stoves
are available in all shapes and
sizes, and can cost from $8 to $30 or
more. These stoves are fueled by
butane or white gas, so they

Backpackers Gear To Conquer Trails

usually must be accompanied by a
gas canister.

To complete your equipment list,
you should have a ﬁrst aid kit (with
bandaids and moleskin), a mess kit
and silverware, a ﬂashlight or
candle lantern, canteens holding a
day’s worth of water, water
purifying tablets, matches, a knife,
maps and a length of light, strong
rope. Insect repellent. a small
towel, soap, a toothbrush and
toothpaste also are nice to have
along. Extra garbage bags will
keep your pack and boots dry at
night. Items such as sunglasses,
ﬁeld guides and cameras can be
included if you have the room and
the strength to carry them.

Clothing needs vary with the
length of the trip and the time of
the year it is taken. Basic needs for
a summer trip are a pair of
loose-ﬁtting long pants, a pair of
shorts, a long-sleeved shirt, a
short-sleeved shirt, a jacket, a hat,
a poncho and two changes of socks.
Again, think light, but be sure you
have enough to stay warm on cool
evenings and mornings.

Not many of us can make it on
roots and berries, so it is wise to
take along some food. Don’t be
duped into buying expensive
freeze’-dried foods. If you plan well,
you can ﬁnd everything you need in
the supermarket for a fraction of
the cost.

For breakfast, try some dried
fruit and cereal. Granola tends to be
heavy and bulky; a cereal like
Grapenuts is better. Also bring
powdered milk to moisten your
cereal.

A sandwich spread on two or
three round, four-inch crackers do
nicely for lunch. Bread is heavy,
and difﬁcult to pack without being
smashed. Toppings can vary from
peanut butter to Cheese Whiz to
ham or roast beef spread. A drink
like lemonade is a refreshing
pick-up.

Local Toiletry Costs Vary

By DAVE MCDONALD
Pitt News Staff Writer

As college‘ students know, there
comes a time when one must wash
hair, body, teeth, ears and mouth,
shave, deodorize, clear up
To
perform these tasks, one must buy
the necessary cosmetic items at a

drugstore of supermarket.

In the Oakland Forbes Avenue
business district, there are six
major stores at which students can
buy cosmetic needs: Sun Drug, Red
Shield, Thrift Drug, Gil’s, Giant
Eagle and A&P.

In a survey of 21 products
available at these stores, Gil’s led
the pack, with the lowest prices on
nine products. Giant Eagle was
second‘ with six, RedShield and
A&P tied with one and a half and
Thrift Drug and Sun Drug tied for
last, each had the lowest price on
only one product surveyed.

As this reporter sneaked up and
down the isles of these stores with
notebook and pen in hand, he
discovered prices varied as much as
60 cents on items costing $2.50.
There was a difference of $4.74
between the highest- and lowest-
priced groups of 21 items.

The small Gil’s store has
consistently low prices and well-
stocked shelves, but does not carry
many name-brand bath soaps.

Giant Eagle has a poor selection
on its small health and beauty aids
shelf, although it has the lowest
prices on name brands, particularly
bath soaps. Thrift Drug and Red
Shield’s prices are a little below
average, A&P has a good selection
and moderate prices. Don’t “run to
Sun,” for it has the highest-priced
items.

The larger the size of an item, the

less it costs per ounce. It is a good

idea to buy store brands over name
brands; stores often buy name
brands in large quantities. mark
them as store brands, and sell them
at lower prices.

When buying prescribed drugs,
try to purchase a generic drug
rather than a name-brand drug.
Generic drug manufacturers can
sell their products at lower prices
because they do not have expensive
advertising campaigns. A doctor
can indicate on a prescription blank
whether a lower-priced generic
drug can be substituted for a
brand-name drug.

Pitt students paying the $16
Student Health fee can obtain drugs
at the Student Health Service for
little or no fee. .

Next week’s edition of Con-
sumer Corner will feature a
survey on buying beer in Oakland.

WHY Me You

For dinner, try a boxed meal, like
macaroni and cheese or egg
noodles and chicken. They need a
little milk and butter.

Carry along some snacks for
energy pit stops; candy bars, dried
fruit granola bars and gorp (a
mixture of raisins, M&M’s and
peanuts) are good. Coffee and tea
eat up fuel, but add a lot to a cold
morning or evening.

With equipment and provisions
in hand, you need to know where
the trails are. There are several
good ones in Western Pennsyl-
Vania.

Baker Trail extends about 145
miles, from Freeport to Allegheny
National Forest. Parts of the trail
include long stretches of dirt road,
which can be hot and hard on the
feet. The trail also crosses a
substantial amount of farmland,
and dogs can be a problem. I once
came within an inch of losing a

large portion of ﬂesh to one dog. ‘

The Laurel Highlands Hiking

Trail is about 80 miles in length,’

and stretches from Ohiopyle to
Johnstown. It is a beautiful trail,
with well-developed shelter areas
every eight to 10 miles. There are
some difﬁcult climbs, but they
often result in exceptional views.

If you don’t mind traveling a bit,
there are hiking trails in Allegheny
National Forest to the north. To the
east are the Quehanna, Warrior,
Susquehannock and Black Forest
Trails.

The Appalachian Trail, which
runs from Maine to Georgia, also
crosses eastern Pennsylvania. For
the experienced hiker, doing the
entire trail in a summer is a tough
challenge to pass up. But the “A
Trail” is well-known, and tends to
be so overcrowded that many
hikers are beginning to avoid it.

Dozens of smaller trails can be
found in the area, ranging from
walks in Frick Park to a historical
trail following General Forbes’
route on his way to capture Fort
Duquesne in 1758.

If you want to know more about
backing—and there is much more
to know—there are many “how to”
books on the market, as well as
books that offer detailed descrip-
tions of trails. Organizations such a
as Youth Hostels and the Sierra
Club, both of which have Pitts-
burgh chapters, plan group trips
and offer instruction. Local colleges
have begun to offer adult courses in
the sport.

Floating 

By MARC SELVAGGIO

Last June 1 witnessed how the
media can literally create what
becomes the new wave in theater.
The New Theater Festival press
corps was directing writers to
speciﬁc theater groups. For’
example, we were told the South
African Black Theater Project was
causing quite a sensation, and that
we should all cover it, since they
were going to be arrested the
moment they returned to South
Africa. Uhmm, they must be good.

And perhaps they were (though I
heard a woman tell me they were
repulsive, and that she mistakenly
took her young daughter with her).
Should their politics be the sole
reason for their popularity? Sensa-
:ion has become sensationalism.

The fascination with politics and
artists (especially those victimized
by the Soviet bloc countries)
reminds me of America’s short-
lived romance with Solzhenitzin, a
romance which fizzled when he
became as vehement against
American hypocrisy as against
Russian.

For a theater group that claims an
alliance with Antoine Artaud, Squat
has surrounded itself—-or has been
surrounded——by the worst kind of
empty publicity chatter imaginable.
And this is the kind of rhetoric that
sells theater: “major theatrical

presence”; “the relationships are
dense”; “the contrast of multiple
realities astonishing”; “the per-

formers are magniﬁciently pres-
ent.” It’s a language that tells, but
doesn’t show. It’s PR “blurbese,”
the language of mediocrity or com-
mercialism, the kind of language

Pitt Poetry ! Series

people don’t question and say,
“what does this mean?” What it
means, as far as Squat, is that
someone has to come clean about
the talk, about what's really going
on.

Reviewers of Squat’s first
performance in America have
deliberately remained in the safety
zone. One reviewer said, “no des-
cription can compare with the
language of seeing Squat, etc., etc. ’
Nice way out. Language cannot do
justice, which ﬁts Artaud"s feeling

remark: “l have little regard for an
art that deliberately aims to shock
because it is unable to convince.”
We need to be shocked, in the most
violent way (this is Artaud
speaking). “Theater should be like
a shock treatment, galvanize, shock
people into feeling. So we all
become galvanized, like garbage
cans.”

The kind of talk we are presented
with is “Video monitors become a
powerful distancing tool.” In the

section called “Dinner,” two

of the inadequacy of language.

Arthur Sainer, in his Village
Voice review (6/27/77), wrote, “I
don’t wish to detail any of the
several plays Squat is performing...
but simply want to speak further of
qualities.” He wants to avoid
saying what they do because their
work contains “shocks whose
potency is at least partially based on
surprise.” I think of Camus’s

Poetry Makes

By CATHY D . MILLER

“Sometimes I wonder whether I
am man or woman.”

No, that is not a line from Virginia
Woolf’s “Orlando,” but a state-
ment by poet Siv Cedering Fox
during her Valentine’s Day reading.

The choice of Fox for Valentine’s
Day was an appropriate one.
Reading an erotic Fox "poem is like
making love after a long period of
celibacy. You realize that you do
remember all those little aspects of
‘ And Fox, in her constant

‘ ‘ quest for love, helps us remember

them.

Fox, a Swede, has written a dozen
or so books of poetry and made
numerous translations from her
native language. She immigrated to
the United States in the 1940’s and
is presently working on a children’s
book and a novel.

The reading began with Fox’s
erotic poems. She does not spare

humour in her work or her delivery. a’

The peach, for example, is a
recurrent image. She writes in

_«wPeaches” of a Madame Ling (“or

’ was it Ching’ ’) who participated in a
contest in China for the best picture
of a peach which, in that country, is

demonstrates Ling’_s_ resourceful-

ness by telling us that she “sat in
some yellow/pollen, then/care-
fully, again/ she sat/ upon a piece of
white/ paper. ’ ’

When Fox reads her erotic
poetry, she raises herself up to full
height, proud of what she’s written.
However, Fox’s usual tongue-in-
cheek delivery was dampened by a
reading of “How to Eat a Fortune
Cookie.” She read the poem softly
and apologetically. One almost
wanted to come to her defense. At
one point she paused and remarked

  

“This rea y is
profound. Isn’t it?” She shared
with her audience the feelings of the
writer who is no longer satisﬁed
with previous work. But “Fortune
Cookie” is a ﬁne book, a series of
poems that were written as one and
should not be separated from each
other or from the drawings that
accompany them.

much like “Saturday Night Live,”
but without the corny.captions.

Since the monitor is on the stage,
the audience observes itself on
stage. The same thing can happen
when we look in a mirror. But
theater like Squat’s is life—our life

book “Mother Is” proves this. The
title poem begins:

in an asylum, “obsessed with sexual

fantasies. ”
Fourth of July exploded inside her.
The paper boy threw his genitals on

her doorstep,
The milkman brought the cow’s

very teats

to her box.

It tells of the awakening of a woman
to her mother’s insanity, describing
the fears she has of becoming like
her mother. Although she can joke
about it, the daughter passes her
fears, which have turned into
aberrant modesty, to her
daughters, and tries to protect them
as she “(reads) recipes, (sterilizes)
jars,” in the kitchen.

At one point, Fox said that she
never prepares for her readings, but
one really wishes she would.
Although she referred to the
“Mother Is” poem, she didn’t read
it, and one wonders about the
choices of the ones she did read.
The “Fortune Cookie” experience
could have been avoided altogether
with some planning, and though
“Dead Women” is clearly one of
her best, from “Mother is,”
someone had to request it. In it,
dead women come in the middle of
the night to “...enter our beds/to
feel the warmth of a man/they had
almost forgotten/but not forgot-
ten,” while we get up in the
morning and “raise the brush or
comb to our heads,/ stop, notice the
hair, / continue. ’ ’

Unfortunately, her more openly
feminist poems, such as “Dead
Women,” were read almost as an
afterthought, if at all. Like the
daughter in “Mother Is,” Fox
seems to “fear inheritance.”

A Friday, February 17, 197s—'rm: PITT NEWS—Page 7

is our art.

In another section, a woman
reads Artaud’s letter to Breton
while a video camera is placed and
focused between her legs. Trans-
lated into “b1urbese,” it means
“the effective use of Artaud’s
letter.”

During Squat’s play Pig/Child/
Fire (it should be Goat/Child/ Fire
-—they couldn’t get a pig) the
audience observes the action, which
takes place before a large storefront
window. Scenes beyond the
window also become part of the
performance, like the two boys who
were standing on the sidewalk,
eating pizza and watching the
woman in “dinner” read the letter.
All the world’s a stage. Life is
theater. Perhaps the storefront
facade (Squat’s theater admits, in a
way, its artiﬁce) is to awaken us to
our dispassionate, detached, ob-
serving view of the world. Artaud
said theater should awaken; it can’t
reawaken, because that supposes
we were once awake.

One thing that awakens us is the
“violent imagery.” In the ﬁrst
section a larger “twice-life-size”
ﬁgure of man hanging upside down
with a normal-sized head ‘protrud-
ing from its anus is stage right, and,
after a long series of disconnected
action, “the woman pulls away the
giant ﬁgure, leaving a man hanging
by his neck. As the body convulses,
the man ejaculates. He removes his
mask to reveal an identical real face
beneath, then dies. As German
dance music plays, the woman
clasps the man’s swinging body”
(Theodore Shank). It reads like the
parody of an avant-garde theater
group; there is no apparent reason
for what happens.

Perhaps that is why she commented
as she did about being man or
woman. At ﬁrst, it seems the
comment of an aspiring androgyne,
the artist to the fullest extent of the
word, becoming a sensibility
instead of a sex. However, Siv Fox
seems to have turned the tables.
She brazenly recites her erotica
while shyly neglecting the problems
and joys of womenhood that she
delves into so well in her books.
The poet did share some new
work with her audience, reading a
ten-part “Love Poem” which takes
the reader on a holiday with two
lovers. They decide to visit, among

other things, a taxidermist shop, a »

doll factory, a hospital and a circus,
and ﬁnally end up shooting marbles
in a park.

SQUA T: I nane Theater of the Big Yawn

Martin Esslin says that Artaudina
theater possess an element of
humor through its ‘ ‘juxtaposition of
incompatible elements, which turns
the expected order of things upside
down.” And Artaud said that
“where simplicity and order reign,
there can be no theater or drama,
and the true theater...is born out of
an organized anarchy.” That alone
is a juxtaposition. Some kind of
world breaks down (our bourgeosie
order ﬁrst of all) but what rises from
the ashes? From a theater of “pain
and shadows.” ‘ ‘To stop the ﬂames
that destroy the old nest prevents
the rebirth of the bird itself’ ’ (Wil-
liam Carlos Williams). I believe the
world is dynamic, constantly
changing; not revolving (revolution)
but evolving (evolution). One form
rises from another. But how can
theater nurture change? For
Artaud, it’s a matter of plunging us
into the anguish of the world, of
plunging into “the dark forces of
physical emotions, which lie beyond
the trivialities of their (our)
everyday life. ’ ’

But the kind of plunge Squat

' makes is into shallow water. A
lifeless Dionesean theater, ecstasy- V

less, joyless (‘ ‘what is there to laugh
about?”) The rational world is the
world of order, and order equals
repression.

So we move from one polarity to
another—to theater in which
dramatic acts are not analogously
connected with each other, a theater
that works with the basic element of
humor, but remains humorless. A
theater that is ultimately as boring,

and lifeless as the world perpet- _

uated by Hallmark greeting cards.
It is the theater of the Big Yawn.

Brazen Erotic Valentine

often feel to appear perfect and
whole, at any cost. Although the
ﬁnal conversation between the
lovers seems too melodramatic
(almost to the point of ‘ ‘Will you still
love me when I’m old and gray?”) it
is redeemed with a sensitive
recognition of their fears of growing
old and dying.

Fox admits that writing love
poems is extremely hard, and
although she says she is still trying
to write a good one, she has
managed to show us her vision of
“the complicated machinery of the
human heart.”

About writing, Fox comments,
“It’s a selﬁsh act, writing. You get
so inside of yourself sometimes you
forget you are writing for others.
And then you get a letter from

Siv Cedering Fox

someone out there and you realize,
ah, someone really reads that» stuff.
It is an amazing thing, that what you
write goes out to others.”

Yes, Fox, you do have readers.
And contented ones, at that.

89-86

~r4 r

‘time’

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Among the 7,170 fans who saw
Ed Scheuermann score a game-
high 23 points to lead the Pitt
Panthers to an 89-86 overtime
victory over Maryland at the Civic
Arena last night was Terrapin star
recruit Albert King.

King, along with Terrapin coach
Lefty Driesell, had ringside seats
from which to view two unlikely
Panther heroes, Scheuermann and
Pete Strickland, vault Pitt to its
13th win of the season.

7» The six foot-11 inch sophomore

scored seven of Pitt's ﬁrst 17
points, as the Panthers took their
first lead of the night, 17-16. after
eight minutes of the ﬁrst half were

gone. .
After a Pitt timeout. Maryland
switched to a 3-2 zone, and

outscored Pitt, 12-2, over the next
ﬁve minutes to assume a nine-point
lead. 28-19. Terrapin guard .1010

Hunter was deadly with the
long-range jumper, canning six
from better than 15 feet. as

Maryland shot a blistering 68
percent from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst
half.

Scheuermann added three more
hoops in the first half and Dave

7‘ Olinger (inserted into the game for

additional ﬁrepower against the
zone) added eight points in seven
minutes, but Maryland scored the
last four points of the half to take a
43-39 lead at intermission.

The Terrapins extended their
lead to nine, 60-51, after Greg
Manning tallied two quick hoops
with 12 minutes to play in
regulation. Pitt countered by
working the ball inside, Scheuer-
mann and Sam Clancy combined
for six unanswered points and the
Panthers were back in the
ballgame, 60-57.

Pitt cut the lead to a digit on a

3;Wayne Williams layup. but Law-
rence Boston put Maryland back on
top by three. 62-59. after convert-
ing both ends of a one—and-one on
Larry Harris's fourth foul with nine
minutes to go.

Olinger was sent back into the
game to replace Harris and quickly
hit a long jumper to draw Pitt
within one again. After Larry
Gibson canned the front end of a
one-and-one, the Panthers scored
the next six points to take the lead

for the first time since the opening
minutes, 67-63.

After coach Tim Grgurich had a
talk with his players, Terry Knight
scored four quick points, and Pitt
had its biggest lead of the night,
71-64. The Panthers then went to

 Terps Strick-en by Pete, Scheuemtann,

lead, 72-71. I

Maryland points on two goaltend-
ing calls found the Panthers still
holding the short end of the stick,
76-75, with but 1:07 left in the
second half.

Pitt had a chance for victory in
regulation, but Harris misﬁred on a
jumper, Hunter grabbed the loose
ball and was immediately fouled by
Williams (his ﬁfth). Hunter, made
only one of his two opportunites to
put the Terps up by a deuce, 77-75,
with 18 ticks remaining.

Grgurich and the Panthers
reverted to the “Cincinnati play,”
otherwise known as getting the ball
to Harris in the corner for a sure
basket. The play worked, and the
only thing left to be resolved in
regulation was whether Maryland
would answer with a hoop. but
after Boston missed a short
jumper, Pitt was into its third
overtime game of the year.

Scheuermann scored the first
bucket of the overtime to give the
sophomore a career-high 23 points.
Strickland, inserted into the game
after Williams fouled out, ran the
four-corners almost as well as that
renouned thorn in Lefty's uphol-
stered seat, Phil Ford. On three
possessions, Strickland fed Clancy
and scored four points himself, and
Pitt was up by seven, 86-79.

Maryland was unable to recover,
despite the late Panther turnovers,
as Forder Strickland—delivered
the fatal blow with two more
charity tosses with 10 seconds left.

“We played well enough to win,
but we made some awfully foolish
errors at the end of the game,”
Driesell said. “We should have
won the game. but Harris hit the
money shot. That’s all I've got to
say."

Grgurich was a bit more eloquent
after the win that gave him his
most successful season as head
coach.

“We were scared coming into
this game because we have to be
the all-time worst team when we
play in the Arena," Grgurich said.

‘Shoeman ’ Walks Over Lefty, Maryland

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL
Pitt News Staff Writer
The lights were dimmed at the
Civic Arena last night, but few fans
complained. The energy-saving
measure only ﬁgured to make the

 viewing better, since the crowd had

ﬁme to watch stars collide.

The major question before the
game concerned whether it would
be a case of Pitt’s stars, Larry Harris
and Sam Clancy, clashing with
Maryland’s Albert King and
Lawrence Boston, or whether the
Terps’ self—proclaimed luminaries
would destroy each other without a
pass, let alone a pick.

After the game, the only question
that begged an answer was: From
what unknown parts came Ed

Scheuermann’s new-found ability
to control a basketball game?

That wasn’t quite the way
Maryland coach Lefty Driesell put
it. “That Shoeman played pretty
well,” he said after thegame. No
one took the time to correct the top
Terp, but it’s a sure bet Driesell will
have the pronounciation (not to
mention the spelling) of Scheuer-
mann’s name mastered by the time
Pitt next plays his team.

Pitt coach Tim Grgurich said after
his team’s 89-86 overtime win that
Scheuermann, a six foot-11 inch
center who seems to disappear
when he enhales, had been lifting
weights during Pitt’s eight-day
layoff since the West Virginia
game. No matter how hefty a bench

press Scheuermann can manage, he
bettered it last night, because it was
a team that he lifted on the Arena
ﬂoor.

“I think this was my best game at
Pitt,” Scheuermann said after his
23 points and 14 rebounds—each a
career high—had led his team to
victory. “They had some big,
talented guys inside, and the way I
played tonight is deﬁnitely going to
build up my conﬁdence.

“Maryland is a good ballclub, but
we feel like we’re a pretty good
ballclub, too. Now what I have to do
is go to practice tomorrow and
forget about tonight.”

Forgetting about his perform-
ance, which was a spectacular end
to a recent ﬂu-induced slump, may
be harder than was handling the
Terrapins. And that, Pitt’s
collective heartbeat would attest,
was not easy. —

‘‘I thought we had them all the
way,” Larry Harris, who became
Pitt's second-leading career scorer
on a 13-point off-night, said.
Reminded of Lawrence Boston’s
last-second six-foot jumper in
regulation, which would have won
the game had it not rolled off the
rim, Harris amended his thoughts:
“I was praying we had them,
anyway."

It was an unusual game in most
respects. The talent-laden Terps, of
whom forward Larry Gibson has
said, “We’d be great if we could use
four basketballs,” were not hurt by
their individual excesses. JoJo
Hunter, the Terp guard who

apparently believes a pass to be a
missed shot, was the best

illustration of Maryland's style of
play. That style led one player, Bill
Bryant, to keep the ball while
running a four-on-one break, even
after the lone defending Panther

had jumped between the one’s on
Bryant’s No. 11 jersey.

There, too, was the odd
post- game claim of San Clancy, who
said in smiling disbelief: “I mean,
they were the most physical team

Inconsistent Pantherettes Put i

By MARY S.HUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Writer

High-ranked basketball teams
get to the top by playing with
consistency, and the Maryland Lady
Terrapins did just that last night at
the Civic Arena, defeating the
Pantherette basketball squad, 86-
68.
Pitt, now 11-10, stayed with the
fourth-ranked Lady Terps until
midway through the second half,
but Pantherette turnovers and the
quick Maryland offense gradually
wore the Pantherettes down.

“We let them get away,” said
Pantherette coach Jean Balthaser.

over 34 times and beat a good team
like that.”

Down by eight at halftime, the
Pantherettes sprung back to life
after intermission when Wanda
Randolph tied the game at 44 with a
short jumper. For the next ﬁve
minutes it seemed the Pantherettes
would pull off an upset. Mimi
Senkowski scored on a fastbreak
before former Pantherette star,
Debbie Jones, ran the length of the
court to give the Terps the lead,
48-46.

Loeffler was fouled and sank two
free throws to tie the score again.
The score seesawed until the
nine-minute mark, when the Terps

pulled away and controlled the
remainder of the game.
“To win we had to control the

-boards and stop the running game

of Tara Heiss,” Balthaser said.
“We didn’t do either through the
entire game. When we stopped
Heiss, we were in the game,
though.

_ The 5-6 Heiss, with 16 points, was
one of four Lady Terps to break into
double ﬁgures. Jane Zivalich
contributed 19, while Kris Kirchner
had 15.

Randolph took scoring honors for
the night with 28 and teammates
Robin Fry and Debbie Lewis

rounded out the Pantherette scoring
attack with 14 and 10, respectively.

According to Balthaser, Mary-
land has a “ﬁne team,” but is not
unbeatable.

“Maryland is a big team, but not
awesome at both ends of the floor,”
she said. “Their offense was
supurb. They took their shots from
inside and set lots of screens, but
their defense wasn’t as potent.”

“They didn’t play up to my
expectations,” Randolph said.
“They had the reputation of a team
that would blow us out, but we came
out at halftime and it was still
anyone’s game.

“The game wasn’t decided until

“He may be selling a couple of

was getting pushed around in there,
and that’s a bit unusual, don’t you
think?”

Clancy recovered sufficiently to
collect 17 rebounds and also to
repeat his comment about Mary-
land’s King Albert, the 6-7
all-reputation ﬁrst-teamer, who
scored four points while hampered
by injury. “Albert,” pronounced
Clancy, “still hasn’t showed me
nothing.”

What Pitt showed last night, in
addition to an amazing unsettling
ability to make even the most secure

‘ lead seem insufﬁcient, was its best

Arena performance in some time.
That isn’t of necessity a bold
statement, given an Arena record
that Grgurich jokingly estimated at
“oh-and-eighty million,” but Pitt’s
play was outstanding in many
respects.

Pete Strickland resembled Phil
Ford——in execution, at least—when
Pitt needed to spread its offense to
four corners, and the result was

Pitt’s best lead-protecting offense
of the season.

Dave Olinger, long rumored to be
a ﬁne shooter, scored 10 points as a
substitute when Harris was having
problems with his usually-sure
shot.

Most of the Panthers did what
they were supposed to have been

doing all season. The one who
didn’t was Ed Scheuermann, and
because he did so much more than
anyone could have expected, Pitt
may with reasoned eagerness
expect more than a single return
showing at the Arena when the
Eastern Eight holds its tournament
there next month.

(Continued from Page 9)

“You’ve got to give our students
and our fans some credit for
supporting us all year. We really
needed them tonight.”

Although Pitt only shot 43
percent from the ﬁeld, clutch
individual performances from
Scheuermann (14 rebounds),
Olinger (four of ﬁve from the floor
in a substitute role) and Strick-
land’s imitation of Ford.

“Pete did a most fantastic job for
us tonight," Grgurich said. “Guys
like Pete make you winners.”

wouldn’t give in that easily. It may
happen, but I wouldn’t be that quick
to evaluate. Of course, he’s seen
more of them than I have.”

The only way to predict a winner
is to compare both squads’
performances against similar com-
petition—which creates a tangled
mess.

The Panthers, who are now
ranked 16th due to a successful 4-0
road trip, and a 9-1 record in their
last 10 contests, have lost to Buffalo
(32-18) and Bloomsburg (30-11),
two teams the Lions. ranked 17th
‘after a loss to Lehigh last week,
have beaten——Buffalo ‘by a 32-4
score and Bloomsburg by a 19-14
mark).

But PSU lost to Clarion 24-15, a
team Pitt defeated 31-9.

Both clubs have beaten Lock
Haven (Pitt by a 27-12 score; PSU by
a 32-9 score), Maryland (Pitt, 20-15;
PSU, 35-9) and Navy (Pitt, 26-18;
PSU, 23-14), while losing to Lehigh
(Pitt, 21-12; PSU 26-12).

The Lions have a 10-2 record, the
Panthers an 11-3 slate.

Even the team mascots are
similar—both are cats.

“I don’t feel you can look at a
team’s results and judge,” Adams
said. “Wrestling’s funny——one guy
may do well against an opponent,
but then another opponent’s style
may throw him off. I don’t think you
can compare results.”

Injuries have resulted in a
patchwork lineup for Pitt. With
Mike Bond (142 pounds), Ed
Bredniak (150 pounds) and Mike
Palko (177 pounds) deﬁnitely out
and 177-pound senior starter
George O’Korn questionable for the
match, Adams has had to search for
replacements. Kim Smith (142),
Mark Popiolkowski (150), Wayne
Lawrence (150) and Dick McCaffrey
(167-77) will have to do well.

“We’re going to have problems if
they don’t,” Adams said. “Penn
State has balance. Their best
weights are at 118, 126, 150, 158,

n Soup, 86-68

midway through the second half,”
she continued. “Our fouls and
turnovers hurt us tremendously.”

What hurt the Pantherettes most
was the consistent play of the Lady
Terrapins.

and 177, with their 142- and
167-pounders right behind. They
are about the weakest at 190 and
heavyweight.” _

The Lions’ startin_g 190-pounder,
Sam Sallitt, has an 11-7 record
compared to Panther Bill Bailey’s
12-0 mark, giving Pitt the on-paper
advantage there. At heavyweight,

Panther Mark Stepanovich (6-2) will ‘

face winless wrestler Joe Bastardi
(0-6), Larry Fath (0-1), Garry
Kuhlman (0-1) or 167-pound
desparation replacement Rick Sny-
der (8-7-1, including an 0-1
heavyweight record).

Pitt has the edge at 134, with
all-America Rande Stottlemyer
(13-1) facing Bernie Fritz (8-10).

Penn State gets the nod at 150,
where Lion Bill Vollrath (19-3-1) will
battle either Lawrence (0-1) or
Popiolkowski (0-1); at 158, where
senior Dave Becker (19-1-1) meets
freshman Tom Jones (6-7); and at

177, where 158-pounder Panther;

McCaffrey will grapple Dan Pfautz
(17-5-1).

Adams could switch his lineup as
he did at the successful quadrangu-
lar meet at Navy last weekend,
putting Gordon at 177 and
McCaffrey down to a more
comfortable 167 (Gordon won three
of four individual bouts last
weekend at the 177-pound slot) if
O’Korn’s rib injury is too sore to
allow him to compete.

“We’ve considered it,” Adams
said. ‘ ‘It depends on the situation at
that particular point. I don’t know
how I’d do it exactly-——I’ve got to see

)1

what my gut feeling is at that time. 
Pitt’s gut feeling is the desire to-.

win. The Panthers can clinch a
ﬁrst-place finish in the Eastern
Wrestling League for the ﬁrst time
in its three-year history (Penn State
has won the title all three years).

“We want to win any match we’re
in,” Adams said. “It would be the
icing on the cake if we could win.
But it doesn’t make us work any

harder than what we have been.” _

It’s like something from out of a
B-grade horror movie. A sinister-
looking little man steps from
behind the shadows of Fitzgerald
Field House and chuckles: “No one
escapes from...the Russian Flu!

Pitt’s track team is no exception.
Recent bouts with the ﬂu have
considerably reduced the number
of athletes the Panthers have taken
to meets at Michigan State and
Princeton.

Five Panthers placed in indivi-
dual events at the MSU Invita-
tional. Long jumper Ed Taylor’s
leap of 23 feet nine inches won him
second-place honors. During the
competition, Taylor’s two fouled
jumps measured over 24 feet six

Flu Reduces Pitt’s ccc Chances

inches. Keith Taylor was third in
the triple jump, and his 48 foot-one
inch showing was one of his best
this season. In the high jump, Dan
Goodyear ﬁnished ﬁfth at six feet
nine inches, despite running a
101-degree temperature.

Dave McDonald raced to a
second-place time of9:02 in the two-
mile run, while Gary Siriano’s 4:14
mile was good enough for fourth
place.

Pitt’s distance medley relay
team, consisting of Rich Moore
(880 yards), Larry Shippen (440
yards), Siriano (three-quarter mile)
and Tom Herrmann (mile), placed
third in 10:04.

A week earlier at Princeton, it
was much the same story. Third

place performances were turned in
by Ed Taylor (23 feet 10 inches) and
the distance medley team of
Moore, Bud Cooper, Herrmann
and Mel Boyd. Goodyear cleared
six feet 10 inches for fourth-place in
the high jump.

After ﬁnishing seventh at the
Central Collegiate Championships
the past two seasons, the Panthers
are aiming for the top ﬁve this
year. Competition begins today,-
and the Panthers’ best chances for
V1Ct0I'1eS are in the distance and
jumping events. Seniors Boyd and
Goodyear are among the favorites
in the two-mile run and high jump.
Boyd will also anchor the distance
medley team, joining Siriano,
Cooper and Herrmann.

Pitt's PulleyA dds Spice to Pantherettes’ Cause

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Everyone knows variety is the
spice of life.
When the Pantherette swimming

.,£2Eam closes out their dual-meet

season tomorrow at Slippery Rock,
Suzanne Pulley will have swam in
all the short-distance events.

But the freshman from Rich-
mond, Va. hasn’t spread herself
too thin by participating in so many
events. Nothing could be further
from the truth. '

Pulley has already qualiﬁed to
swim in six events—50-yard
freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, 50-
yard butterﬂy, 100-yard breast-
stroke and 100- and 200-yard
individual medley in the Eastern

Association of Intercollegiate Ath-
letics for Women (EAIAW) Cham-
pionships at Penn State March .2-4.
She is also aiming to qualify in two
other events—200-yard freestyle
and 200-yard breastroke—tomor-
row.

But there’s a catch—-a swimmer
can only compete in five events.

To top things off, Pulley has also
qualiﬁed to swim in the AIAW
national championship to be held at
Duke University in Durham, N.C.
March 16-18 as a member of Pitt’s
200-yard freestyle relay team
(all-America Kathy Stetler, Patti
Davis, Christy Elston and Denise
Fleming have also qualiﬁed).

“They’ve been trying to see
where I can swim,” Pulley said.
“Coach (Dick) Bradshaw and
Coach (Kate) Matheson have
been experimenting, I guess. They
haven’t decided what my best
events are.

“That's why they want me to
qualify in the 200 breastroke and
200 freestyle this weekend,” Pulley
continued. “They don’t even know
where they want me to swim in the
Easterns. They ﬁgure the more
events I qualify in, the more
choices they’ll have as where to
have me swim.”

Unlike most swimmers who
prefer to call one or two events
their specialties, Pulley isn’t

bothered every short distance
event has turned into her specialty.

“It makes swimming fun,” she
said. “I like to do everything.
Everything except the distance
events. I don’t like those too much.

“I’m not that much of a
breaststroker, either. And the 200
butterﬂy, well not too many people
like that. It’s a real killer. But I’ll
swim it if I have to.”

Pulley said this season has been
a big thrill for her. A product of a
small AAU program in Richmond,
Pulley ﬁnds college swimming a
new challenge.

“High school swimming in
Richmond isn’t too big.” Pulley
said. “I spent my whole life

swimming in AAU programs and
the like. Believe me when I say that
AAU programs there aren't any-
thing like the one Pitt has.

“We had about 20 people on our
team. “Pitt has something like 100.
They also have a junior group. We
never had such a thing. Ours
wasn't very much of a team. I was
swimming with kids 10- and
13-years-old last year. This is really
my ﬁrst year swimming where all
the swimmers are the same age as I
am.”

A win at Slippery Rock would
give Pitt a 5-4 record, Pulley’s ﬁrst
winning team.

“Now that would be thrilling. It
would make everything I’ve done
this year worthwhile."
