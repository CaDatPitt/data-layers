on Berkeley at Tap Day

Speaker Relates California Crisis

By JACKI KATZ
Today’s college _students
are not content to remain
“scholarly spectators” to the

To New Philosophy at

' drama of life. Stress-ing this,

Allan Schlosser went on to
show the relevance of the
Berkeley crisis to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in his
Tap Day speech Wednesday.

Schlosser explained that
college students of the 1960’s
have apparently taken to heart
Oliver Wendell Holmes’ admoni-
tion that “it is required of a man
that he should share the passion

and action of his time—-at peril V

of being judged not to have lived
at all.”

Students now have a creed of
activism, he said, which is “predi-
cated on the belief that only
commitment can give life a mean-
ing and purpose.

“The new philosophy of ac-
tivism has, I believe, begun to
take hold here at Pitt.” He praised
the Hill Education Project, where
University students tutor under-
privileged children, as “perhaps
the most intrinsically meaning-
ful organization on campus.”

Schlosser also showed the in-
creased involvement of students
by pointing out that “last fall’s
Presidential Election engendered
unprecedented interest a m on g
Pitt students, nearly 500 of whom
where actively involved in the
campaign.”

Part of his address centered
around a public announcement of
approval of the new Student Gov-
ernment. “Most recently,” he
said, referring to the increase in
commitment, “the President-elect
of Student Government proposed
that We, as students, send books
and clothing to the forgotten Ne-
gro of the Deep South.

“There is no one in the audi-
ence who could not contribute a
few paperbooks and some old

clothing to such a Student Gov- ’'
eminent - Sponsored collection I

drive. One need not be a mili.
tant civil rights advocate to ad-

mit that the Negro in Mississippi, ‘

ffrr example. is the helpless vic-
tim of an odious totalitarianism,
in which he is afforded neither

legal protection nor recourse,” he I

exclaimed.

Continuing on the subject of
civil rights and the students, he
said: “Do not let the geographical
distance confuse your under.
standing of the real issue. You

   

Alan Schlosser

must realize that when the Ne-
gro in Hattiesburg, Mississippi,
or in Selma, Alabama, is denied
"his constitutional rights, your
freedom in Pittsburgh is also
endangered.”

Students‘ at the University, as Well
.as those across the country, have
come to realize that the “old
distinction between student and
citizen is, in fact, an artiﬁcal one.
We now consider ourselves, and
properly so, an integral and ma-
ture part of the political system.”

In addition to explaining the
new creed of activism, Schlosser
asked the audience to consider
the “so-called ‘multiversity’ from
the undergraduate point of view.

“Despite all the platitudes
about the democratically-govern-
ed university, with its student

University

government and its faculty sen-
ate, the undergraduates see them-
selves as the exploited class in a
complex and highly impersonal
bureaucratic pyramid.

“At the top resides’ an oligarchy
of experts in ﬁscal affairs, in
physical expansion, and in the
procurement of government con-
tracts. Farther down this struc-
ture is a vast research establish-
ment, staffed perhaps by Nobel
laureates and other professors of
international prestige, but men
whom the undergraduate encoun-
I-'eI'S Only in admissions office lit-
erature.”

He also explained that fresh-
men and sophomore courses are

. taught Primarily by graduate as-

sistants at the larger state um.
versities. “If the student is ex.
posed to the distinguished fag.
ulty member, too often it is only
in lechlre ¢.>011l'SeS. along with sev-
eral hundred other undergrad-
uates.

“The ‘multiversity’ is, futher-
more, full of contradictions. It is
only a slight exaggeration to say
that academic success is likely to
come to the professor who has
learned to neglect his assigned
duties in order to have more
time and energy to pursue his
private professional interests.”

In explaining the multiversity,
Schlosser cited Clark Kerr, pres-
ident of the University of Califor-
ma, as having admitted that
“teaching is less central than it
once was for most faculty mem-
bers; research has become more

Jessica Mitford Talks

On High Cost of Dying  

By J. D. GLASSER

“We will bury you” is a
phrase which American fun-
eral directors like as much
as Nikita Kh-rushchev, Jes-
sica Mitford disclosed at
Wednesday's Midday Series
program.

Miss Mitford is the author of
the recent best seller The Amer-
ican Way of Death which dis-
closes the high cost of dying in
the United States. In fact, her

name has become so synonomous .

with cheap funerals that one
casket manufacturer wants to put
out a line of low priced “Jessica
Mitford” caskets.

The movie rights to her book
have been bought by a Califor-
nia millionaire, she disclosed;
“Maybe he’ll call it My Fair Ca-
daver.

Her book has not made Miss‘
Mitford particularly popular with
the mortuary profession, she re-
vealed. In one public debate over
the price of funerals a mortician
offered to put the authoress away
for only $150. “No thank you,”
she replied. “Others have oﬁered
to do it for nothing.”

At the coffee hour, Miss Mit-
ford encountered several repre-
sentatives of the Pittsburgh In-
stitute of Mortuary Science Des-
pite deliberate and vociferous at-
tempts by Dr. Richard Tobias,
associate professor of English and
discussion moderator, to direct
the discussion past them, the
morticians did indicate repeated-
ly that there is a difference be-
tween morticians and cemetery
directors.

Reaction to mortuary practices
in the United States has led to an
investigation by a Senate sub-
committee. In some cases the in-
vestigators had to have police
protection, revealed Miss Mitford
—-ever since a pair of investiga-
tors were run of! the road by a
mysterious black Cadillac.

Miss Mitford used the Forest
Lawn Cemetery in California as
an example of the extent to
which the funeral service has
been commercialized. In Forest
Lawn’s gift shop, visitors can
buy such items as model Ssalt
shakers, coloring books, and jig
saw puzzles as remembrances.
The lots are priced with regard
to the quality of the view and
cost about $308 for a single.

The proprietors are trying to
push doubles, however, using the
expression “together forever” to
attract customers.

The University and the
city of Pittsburgh were ter-
rorized last Tuesday by a
six foot tall ape represent-
ing Alpha Phi Omega, na-
tional service fraternity. The
A Phi 0 ape was promoting
the Ugly Man On Campus
(UMOC) contest currently in pro-
gress at the University.

UMOC has become a tradition
over. the years at the University
and the other 376 colleges having
Alpha Phi Omega chapters. The
contest was entered this year by
18 “ugly men” representing fra-
ternities, dorm houses, and other
school organizations.

Students vote for the UMOC of
their choice by placing money in
collection boxes for each candi-
date located in the Cathedral,
Towers’ Lobby, and Student
Union. Scoring for the contes-
tants is based 60 per cent on the
money" contributed and 40 per
cent on the judges’ opinion. Em-
peror Hal Murray of radio station

_ KQV will be head -judge.

Student Union Ballroom. Music
will be furnished by the Jaguars,
who played at Winter Weekend.
All the UMOC candidates will
also be present, wearing their
makeup. ‘

Student reaction has been quite
favorable to UMOC. The contest
exhibits have become popular on
campus. but the contributors
seem embarrassed when they de-
posit their money. A student
wearing a ZBT jacket waited un-
til everyone had left the display
to put in his change. He then
quickly deposited his money in
the ZBT box and ran away red-
faced. ‘

Later, a foreign student ap-
broached the boxes with a hand-
ful of pennies. He patiently wait-

ed for everyone to leave the area.

 By 1717 Garfinkel

Those who insist that a Viet Cong
victory in South Viet Nam would be a ‘blow to
our national interest base this view on the so-
called domino theory. According to this theory,
if South Viet Nam falls, the other countries of
Southeast Asia will fall too, one after the other,

 just like dominoes. The validity of this theory

must be examined.
A The domino theory’s credance depends on
two critical assumptions: 1) that China’s im-
- perialist leanings, or the
aggressive n a t u r e of
_communism, is responsi-
: ble for the “Viet Cong
rebellion” 2) that the
situation in South Viet
Nam can be reproduced
at the will of the Com-
munists in the other
Southeast Asian coun-
tries. Since the second
assumption is cl e a r l y
false, it will be discussed
- first.

What we euphemistic-
ally call a rebellion, is a
civil war. The Saigon government now exercises
no effective control in almost two-thirds of the
country. In ‘ many areas control shifts from
week to week and even fromday to night. (See
Peter Grose’s article in the Jan. 24 issue of the
New York Times Magazine.) In this civil war
we and the North Vietnamese both are inter-
fering. - _ _

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to say Just how im-

  

. portant North Vietnamese support of the Viet

Cong is. Peter Grose in the article referred to
above states that the war is directed by the
North. Other analysts, like Bernard B. Fall,

  

cuisine,

author of The Two Vietnams, claims that the
North’s role is far less consequential. But even
if the North is directing the war as we now
claim, that is only half of the story. The par-
ticipation of the North, however great or small,
cannot alone account for the success of the
Viet Cong.

Success in guerrilla warfare depends upon
the support of the people. (See the writings of
Mao Tse-Tung, required reading for our coun-
ter- insurgency forces.) President Diem was
highly unpopular. There has been no stable gov-
ernment since he was overthrown. Religious
strife between Bhudists and Catholics h a s
further complicated matters. The Viet Cong
capitalized on these peculiar factors in South
Viet Nam to win the allegiance of many of the
South Vietnamese people. _

These conditions were not created by the
Chinese, nor the North Vietnamese, nor the
Viet Cong, nor do they exist in the other South-
east Asian countries. In addition, whatever in-
ﬂuence or control the North exerts on the Viet
Cong is possible in large measure because Ho
Chi Minh, a nationalist hero, has numerous
adherents native to the South. Again such a
situation does not pertain in the other South-
east Asian countries. Hence assumption num-
ber two is clearly false. ’

THE FIRST assumption that North Viet
Nam or China is responsible for the war in Viet
Nam is at best dubious. Most Americans are
not aware of the fact that the heaviest weapons.
81 mm. mortars, the Viet Cong used in the
attack on Pleiku were American made! (See
the Charles Mohr articles in the New York
Times of Feb. 8 and 9'.) As Mohr says, “The
question is, therefore, that if the Viet Cong

connected with the paciﬁst-type

LETTERS To THE EDITOR  

shou1dn’t establish a they are driving wheel-chairs or

unit at Pleiku was——as is so often the case-
using captured weapons, would this sustain the
argument that North Viet Nam made possible
this particular attack?”

In addition Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara claimed that the size of the attack
“indicated it was a major blow carefully timed
by Hanoi.” Thus, he j ustiﬁed our expansion of
the war, our Feb. 8 bombing of the North.
Reports from the ﬁeld, however, indicated that
a company of less than 200-300 men took part.
The success of the attack resulted from horri-
bly inadequate security precautions. (See
Mohr’s articles.) -

The domino theory is ‘based on two key
assumptions: one highly dubious, the other
clearly false. Our national interest which is
to prevent China from achieving hegemony
over all Asia would be best served if we with-
draw from Viet Nam through a reactivization
of the 1954 Geneva Conference or through the
use of the . United Nations. We should work
for a neutralization of all Southeast Asia. But
even if the worst happens, even if South Viet
Nam goes Communist, we not the Chinese will
be the beneﬁciaries in the long run.

ONCE WE WITHDRAW from South Viet
Nam, once we cease to be the white imperialist
enemy, as discussed in my last article, the his-
toric enmity between the Vietnamese and the
Chinese peoples will reassert itself. We can
then, under our nuclear umbrella, without ap-
pearing to take the stance of a white imperial-
ist power, protect the Southeast Asian coun-
tries from the threat of Chinese invasion.

Surely such a policy is far more rational
than fighting on the losing side of a war.

A Financial Ideas

Editor, The Pitt News:

In view of the fact that the
University of Pittsburgh ‘has al-
ways gone all out for its stu-
dents, I now suggest the students

’ are bound by sacred obligation

to return the favor.

We are all aware that the Uni-
versity is involved in a 31‘-We fl‘
nancial struggle. Bankrupting this
University, no mean feat in it-
self, has been accomplished. des-
pite tuition increases, ID card
fees, student activity fees. grad-
uation fees, late registration fees.
change of course fees and a lim-
itless number of petty charges-
What then is the answer? Close
Allegheny Observatory? SMASH-

A " me!

.\It is certain the University has

. exhausted every possible source

of revenue. 1 know they have ex-
hausted the resources of a large
proportion of its student body-
Why can't we just have bigger
classes and fewer professors? But

V. ‘wait, I think I can now offer
" - some feasible solutions.

Since it is the undergraduate

 student who has previously suf-

fered most from this catastrophe,

  I suggest we further exploit
' ‘ every undergraduate student pos-

sible. He is struggling now. and

iﬂitiseasytokickamanwhen

he’s down.

In Europe most elevators have
coin boxes. This might 110‘? W011‘
here though. Here is a more

‘A is workable plan. We could auto-

mate the elevators, and change
the elevator operators into ticket
collectors. These tickets could be

 ~ purchased upon presentation of
'~ _ a validated invoice and ID card

8i8n_ed by the head of each de
partment of each school.

All fine restaurants have cover
charges. I see no reason why
‘the Tuck Shop, having such ﬁne

$1.00 minimum.

Race tracks have coin operated
turn-stills. Why can't we?

When the city so conveniently
metered every square foot of
parking space surrounding the
University, they seemed to have
«overlooked the streets around
Clapp Hall. Maybe Clapp Hall has
some type’ of diplomatic ‘immun-
ity. Since Pitt made a concerted
effort to prevent these meters,
they could install a few of their
own on the afore mentioned
streets -or add a special Univer-
sity meter beside the existing
city meters. Pitt has encouraged
so many students to use public
transportation, and is, therefore,
in a ﬁne position to negotiate
with PAT concerning a bit of
revenue. ‘

All schools within the Univer-
sity have been most generous
with catalogs. These handsome,
information packed editions look
as though they should sell for at
least $5.00. Why not?

But to quote the sage of this
noble institution, “If you don't
like it here-—LEAVE.”

Reader Critical
Of Eric Stern

Editor. The Pitt News:

As they say in the commer-
cials: Eric is here.

A man whose name has been

. protest during the Cuban crisis,

and whose distinctive proﬁle was
observed at the demonstration.

He seems anti-Litchﬁeld, anti-
Saga, anti-IVDDC, anti-status quo,
and anti-barbers.

But alas, we have chosen this
man to lead us, to represent us,
and to typify the Pitt undergrad,
and so be it. Who knows; maybe
next year_ that lackadaisical ma-
jority, whom I consider respon-
sible for this disaster, will be in-
spired perhaps to submit to the
ordeal by ballot and vote.

I feel like many Republicans
must have after their nominating
convention an._d.ask, “What have
we done.”

It is nice to learn that there

As a visitor staying in the dormi-

There are many students who
leave their empty trays on the

of the cases they are healthy and
strong boys! Why can't they carry
their empty trays to the belt con-
veyor, when they can easily
carry heavy trays loaded with
food to their table?

It is also a pity to watch so
much food remain on the trays.
In our childhood we were taught
that waste of food was a kind
of sin. Please take as much food
as you think you can eat, but not
more. In case you are still hun-

Editor, The Pitt News:

As one who attended Tap Day
for the first time, I must say I was
greatly surprised by the excel-
lent job done by the people run-
ning it.

After an apparently unavoid-
able late start, the program ran
smoothly and professionally. Miss

important . . . the higher a man’s
standing, the less he has to do
with students . . .”

“The paradox, in a nutshell,”
Schlosser said, “is that having a
‘superior’ faculty (superior in
terms of prestige) often results
in an inferior education for the
undergraduate student.”

“I am happy to say that the
Orwellian picture which I have
sketched for you is less appli-
cable to Pitt than it is to such
leviathans as the University of
California and _the University of
Texas systems, or, for example,
Michigan State University. I be-
lieve that at Pitt, faculty mem-
bers are generally accessible to
the interested undergraduate.”

“Also, freshmen and sopho-
mores are less dependent upon
graduate teaching assistants than
are their counterparts in Califor-
nia. I do hope, however,” he con-
tinued, “that we will proﬁt from
the tragedy of Berkeley; for the
University of Pittsburgh, like the
University of California, has
chosen the path of future ex-
pansion and growth.”

“The problems that Cal is now
facing and that Pitt will be fac-
ing are essentially the problems

of ‘bigness.’ And before there can
be any lasting solutions, there
will have to’ be sensitive leader-
ship and respect within the aca-
demic community.”

Schlosser explained the collision
which occured "at Berkeley and

student in an endless web of reg-
ulations and regimentation. If
you want meaningful and lasting
solutions to student problems,
give the student the responsibil-
ity of decision-making, let him
breathe the fresh air of free-
dom.”

then continued, “It seems to me
that like Berkeley, the adminis-
tration here at Pitt does not fully
respect the opinions of its stu-
dents. The problem is intensiﬁed
by a growing and unmistakable
maturity among our student lead-
ers.” He cited the proposals of
the two parties in the recent SG
election as examples of this grow-
ing maturity.

Schlosser concluded by saying,
“I am simply calling for more
student decision-making in those
matters that ‘directly affect the
vital interests of the student. I
would remind the paternalistic
administrator that before there
can be any real maturity, there
must be greater responsibility
and more freedom for the stu-
dent.”

“The undergraduate cannot .and
will not mature in an atmosphere
of distrust. Do not speak in terms
of ‘freedom’ and ‘responsibility,’

1 Frosh Matmen Enter

Plebe Tourney Today

By BILL CABIN

Freshmen wrestlers have done little this season
except practice and work out against the varsity. . Coach
Rex Peery, however, enters a complete freshman squad
in the Plebe Tournament being held today and tomorrow
at Annapolis.

Peery feels the team’s top contenders are Jim
Rhone (147), Randy Kahler (177), and Jack Williams
(191). Both Rhone and Kahler were teammates at Hum-
melstown High School last 'year.,

The remainder of the team includes: Rich Shildt (123), Ed
Heincelman (123), Ron Schuchert. (130), Lance Manley (137),
Tom Jackson (157), Tim 'I'rax (167), and Terry Hoover (heavy-
weight).

The wrestlers should place well in the team standings. since
not all schools are entering full teams. Although the tournament
is open to all Eastern squads, Maryland, Navy, Penn State, West
Chester, Shippensburg, Franklin and Marshall, and Lycoming
are the only teams with entrants.

Many other Eastern colleges enter teams in the Freshman
Tournament‘ at West Point. West Points’ tournament is the older
of the two; the Plebe tournament beginning just last season.

“Last season was its first season,” recalled Peery, “and they
held a round-robin elimination because there were few entries.”
This year, however, there are about 120 entries and a single-
elimination procedure is being used.

Assistant wrestling coach Ken Barr coaches the team for the
tournament, and expects some good individual performances.
Barr compiled a 26-14-2 record while wrestling three years here,
and was runner-up in the 177-pound division at the 1964 Easternsr

The Plelbe tournament was initiated by Navy’s head wrest-
ling coach Ed Peery. Peery (-Ed) is coach Rex Peery’s younger
son, and a Pitt alumnus. He won the NCAA 123-pound division
title in 1955-57, and was outstanding in the 1957 Easterns,

Miami of Ohio hosts the
basketballiteam tomorrow in
the Panthers ﬁnal appear-
ance of the 1964-65 season.
The game takes on a differ-
ent meaning for Miami. A
Win over the hoopsters would
be very signiﬁcant in their quest
for the Mid-American Confer-
ence championship.

Only Ohio University stands in
the way of a berth in the NCAA
regionals for Miami. “Miami has
had the same team for three
years,” said coach Bob Timmons.
“They play excellent defense,
pressing all the time. On offense,
they play .a deliberate type of
game. Their front line averages
about six-six and they can real-
ly jump. Plus Charley Coles, the
team’s leading scorer, is a ﬁne
guard.” Coles averages 18 points
per game.

The Panthers tuned up for the
Redskins by trouncing Carnegie
Tech, 80-60, Wednesday night at
Tech’s tiny Skibo Gym. Jim La-.

Valley played his best game of
the season against the shorter
Tartans, scoring 16 points. “La-
Valley has good speed for a big
man,” noted Timmons. “He’s
coming along and we expect big
things from him next year.”
Daryle Ruby once again led the
hoopsters, hitting for 19 points,
playing only half the game. It
was his layup that put the Pan-
thers ahead to stay, 14-13, with
nine minutes gone in the ﬁrst
half. Larry Sykowny contributed
17 points, many of them follow-
ing steals in the back court.
Brian Fisher played his usual
aggressive defensive game. Tim-
mons took him out during the
second half but then had to rein-
sert him. “Fisher settles down
the ball club,” said Timmons.
“The game was getting sloppy
-and that’s why I put him back
in.” The Panthers had a 17 point
lead at the time with Tech gain-
ing a little momentum. Two min-
utes after Fisher entered the
game, the hoopster lead was 21
and they had regained control.
The only thing that the Car-
negie Tech fans had to root for
during the game was Don Keefer,
the 5-10 center, who won the

Bob Lovett had one hot streak
in the game. He scored eight
points in a row near the end of
the ﬁrst half. His spurt enabled
the hoopsters to go to the dress-
ing room with a 43-27 edge. “Our
strategy was to throw the ball
up, and if it didn’t go in, to grab
the rebound,” said Timmons.
“Since their biggest man was 6-3,
it didn’t take too much effort.

'* DAVE McKlNNls demonstrates the form on the still rings
hopes will gain him a place in the Eastern Intercollegiate 1
tics League's meet being held today and tomorrow at Tem
versity. Mcliinnis considers his chances to be slim.

Junior Seeks Berth
> In Eastern Regionals

By TOM SACKS ..

Tension presses junior Dave Insuring Pl,
McKi.nnis in the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Gymnastic champion- 0 -
ships today at Temple and he = 20 /0 mswu
feels it. s Auto 0 Home Owne
\ If he can equal his score in     A I

" the" ‘closing dual meets on the ~

A still rings, he has a good chance '
of receiving one of the eight ‘
berths in the NCAA Eastern Re-
gionals next week at the Univer-
sity of Virginia. He is also en-
tered in the floor exercises and
side horse.

Along with McKinnis, coach
Warren Neiger is also taking lg

‘ Perez, Jim ‘Sacco, Roland James,
Gary Barr, and Tom Misage.
“We’re going to be hard pressed
to place anyone,” said Neiger,
“but still rings is our best
chance.”

McKinnis admits‘ his chances
are slim. “There will be 14 people
in the meet who have equaled or
bettered my best score. I’m hop-
ing that somewhere I’ll squeeze
in. It’s the toughest competition
I've ever been. in and I’m the
most nervous I've ever been.” ‘

Among the still ring competi-

W. tors will be a perfonner from

, Springﬁeld who averages 9.8 and

is possibly the best in the coun- _

try. There are ﬁve gymnasts

alone from Penn State who have
bettered McKinnis’ 9.4 rating.

His chances are ‘dependent on
one trick—the shoot hand stand.
