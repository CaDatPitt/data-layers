SADDENS STUDENTS  

 

Undergraduates and 0 Faculty Mourn
Loss of Henry T. L. Lauri.

 

On last Thursday morning the -Uni-
versity authorities and many of the
students were informed of the sudden
death of Henry T. L. Laun, Jr. _

The sad news came as a severe
shock to all who had known Henry
in his university work and elsewhere.
He was a member of t'he Sophomore
class in the Engineering School, but
during the present term was working

for the Pittsburgh Transformer Co«m- E

pany, as he had been assigned to a_
position with that ﬁrm under the co-
operative -plan of the Engineering
School. About eight o’clock on
Thursday morning, while performingi

his duties. as a tester he fell from '

some unknown cause, and his face
came in contact with a. live wire
which killed him instantly. His re-

mains were removed to his home in
Carnegie, where many of his friends
fellow students of the University and
fellow alumni of the Carnegie High
School were granted the privilege of
looking upon the features

i’Address on Lincoln Is Delivered by
1 Dr. McCormick at Central H. S.

i Chancellor McCormick in his speech
ion "Lincoln"' at Central High School
last week, said in part:

“I think, as I read his own words
that he was one of the most religious
men I have ever read of in history:
that he was, down deep in his heart
a, lover of God; obedient, as he under-
stood it, to the law of God, and that
it was not so much for him to have
God on his side at to be sure that he
was on God’s side. Down through
the y-ears when the weight rested

"seamed with care, that thought was
ever upon him; his trust in God grew
deeper and his faith in the ultimate
outcome grew stronger, because there
was more and more the spirit of obed-
ience to the divine will. And great
as were those characteristics to which
I have referred, ]. suspect, young
men and women, that here is the ex-
planation of them all, his attitude of

day become more and more a lesson
in our lives and as we learn to love
the- man better, let us also learn to
love the" things for which he stood
better and practice ‘them in our lives.”

‘ OUR LO-SS.

During th-e last week a great loss

has fallen upon the faculty and stu-

: j dents" of the University. In the tragic
‘S death of Henry Laun we h.ave lost
one who has always be-en a source of
strength to our school. ' A loyal friend

of the University, a close student, a

, _ faithful fri-end, he made friends wher-
7 ever he went. As secretary of the

Charrtiiers Valley Pitt Club, he was a
most active spirit in making! it a suc-
cess. One of his friends has truly
said: “He has never been known to
do a mean thing.” In whatever he
did, he put his whole soul. With the
most exacting care he performed each
task which fell to his part.

of hope. His loyalty and faithfulness
will remain for many years an exam-
ple to many. In his short stay with
us he has influenced acquaintances
and friends’ for good. The manly
qualities whi'ch he so well set forth
will live on his friends as a result of
his inﬂuence. His spirit will remain
within our w.alls for years to come
So though with.sadness, with great
sorrow, we mourn his departure, yet
let us be thankful for the brief stay
in which he was permitted to exert Sr
great an inﬂuence over us. His high
ideals of manhood will long live in
our hearts as his contribution to life

THE ANNIVERSARY.

But ﬁve. more days, and our great
anniversary celebration is upon us
Every day our work is growing more
complete. Soon there will remain but
the actual performance of the plans
which have been occuping our atten-
tion for the last six months. With
regard to those exercises to be con-
ducted by the faculty, little more can
be done. "But there yet remains a
vast ﬁeld for effort on the part of the
student body. After all is said and done
the success of our celebration will
h.ave been determined by the efforts
of the undergraduates. With our duty
thus staring us in the face, let us ﬁrs-t
determine what is needed and then
do it.

of the undergraduate will be that of
helping to swell the crowd at our

hundred must be present in‘ order to
permit the Alumni to carry out their
plans successfully. So far but few of
the students have secured tickets
;Many others ‘have expressed their in-
tention to go——‘but they have not se-
cured tickets. Students, do not delay
securing your tickets. Order them at
once. Every day you fail to get your
tickets causes so_ much more trouble
for the Alumni Association. When
-treated so generously as we have been
by our alumni, it behooves us to dr-
all in our‘power to aid them. '
Another most important event is the
torchlight parade, in which every stu«
dent is expected to take part. With
the celebrationrof cap night, our an-
niversary week will be well started
No one.who has ever attended these
delightful affairs will ever willingly be
absentvfrom this one. The Freshmen
are planning to make it -the standard
of excellence for the future. No stu-
dent will be absent from this perform-
ance; From the start of the parade
at Craft avenue to the bonﬁre on the
hill and the salting of =the Freshmen
not a dull moment-will be found.
And then there will be the historical
play, the musical concert, the proces-
sions on Wednesday, the meetings
during «the week. From the starting
hour of the torchlight parade to the
grand ﬁnale on Thursday night there
will be such. an‘ overﬂow of Pitt spirit
expressed as it has been during the
winter-—as will awaken old Pittsburgh
to an increased sense of the greatness
of the venerable institution of learning
.which so proudly bears i-ts city’s name

‘Pitt ‘Parts

By Prowler. .

 

College and university libraries are
seldom mentioned in the accounts of
football games. In fact, hundreds of
students pass through four serene years
of university life and‘ never make the
acquaintance of the reading room chairs.

It is one of the peculiar happenings at-1

tributed to_ higher education.

Not so long ago I had occasion to

stray unprotected into the library of
the University. Congenial abode for
dusty volumes and the individual who
keeps an ever vigilant eye for leaking
fountain pens! But, as an inviting},-ec
treat for quiet and comfortable study it
lacks the advantages of a B. and 0.
train. A

And I don‘t’kn0w, but those dull, grey
aspects are responsible for the aloof-
ness of the average student to the li-
brary. I realize the University is not
in a position to give the library, the nec-
essary frills at this time, but I wonder.
just wonder if a few comfortable chairs
would be possible.» I wonder!

I did not remain in the book storage

very l.ong, but the young lady sitting at;
Gracious, but

I suppose she is called the librarian. Oh!

This University is a funny place. Yes.
sir; a genuine laughable, comical, droll
and ludicrous ‘spot! .'

Next week‘ We are to see the sable
shades of night punctured with a huge
electric sign, emblazioning the name of
the University to the world (via Fifth
avenue street cars). A few days ago we
learned that the University of Pitts-
burgh was investigating the relative

merits of Oakland soot and downtown‘

fog (the smoke nuisance); Last fall we

had a ‘football team strong enough to}

beat the average and hold the best (“stu-
dent” recreation). And every year sees
the catalog ﬁlled with—a faculty list.

Truly a marvelous University! Aye
a curious University!

The wits of all ages have tinkered

with verse and song concerning that
universal divertisement, which, for the
lack of a more poetic name, the vulgar
horde has termed, “spooning.” But, it
remained for a ‘University student to
bring forth the most unique phaseof
the subject.

A student in the Medical College last
week, while at work in the dissecting
department, removed a full sized silver
spoon/from the stomach of “a patient.”
The doctors are at a loss to account for
such a strange happening-

It does beat all

By Way of friendly warning to anni-
versary week orators: The Acropolis
never boasted a ﬂaring electric sign
Just a gentle 'hint——‘no charges. Nothing
worse than a mixed simile, you know!

Oh, by the way, won't that Acropolis
similarity be worked to death next'week.
But, we can stand it.

The Alumni Association unintention-

when arranging for the big banquet’next

A if we can
Isome day read in the history of our Uni-
lversity, “In the one hundred and twenty-
lﬁfth year of the University of Pitts-
gburgh the debating teams won two con-
'tests.” It seems to me that it is not
‘enough that we are to have two splen-
ldid debating teams, as we surely are
!this year, but it is also necessary that
,we have an awakened interest on the
?part of overy student in debateso that
when the evening of the debate comes
jwe will have an enthusiastic crowd of
Estudents to cheer our boys on to vic-
;tory. It is high time that we should
give due recognition to the man who
,thinks, for who after all better repre-
gsents the University and all that -it
stands for‘?

GIFT TO CLASSICAL LIBRARY

»Through the generosity of certain
friendsancl graduates of the Univer-
sity, the Classical Department has re-
cently purchased a complete set of
Greek and Latin classical texts, num-
bering about ﬁve hundred and ﬁfty
volumes, known as the Teubner series
iof Greek and Latinauthors.

A Most of the books have come and
are housed, for the present, in room
402, Thaw Hall, where they can be
used for reference. '

‘ "This series forms an admirable
nucleus on which to build up .a well-
equipped classical library, so absolute-
ly essential for the study of the life_

game they are capable ofthe last de-

4 feat would have been an easy victory

The lack of spirit and aggressiveness
exhibited in the past two games is due
to {the fact that no cheerl-eaders and
few rooters‘ are present. ‘Cheerleader
Kirk has two assistants and if he ﬁnds
it impossible to be at the games, it is
imperative that he arranges for one of
the other men -to take his place. If»:
man accepts the position of Cheer-
1-eader he should expect to assume as
much responsibility for defeats as the

3 players themselves, and few of them

ever failto report for games. More
rooters should show up as their sup-
port is necessary; there were about 50
at the last game where there should
have been at least 200. Get busy.
Captain Campbelldid not play in
the game on account of a death in hir
family and though Brady, who took

his place,—put up a good game, the '

ca-pt.ain’s, absence from the lineup was
keenly felt and the loss of the game
may be charged to this. Pitt took the
.lead_ when Harley Campbell tossed in
a foul goal and then a ﬁ-eld goal, an.d

 the game looked like a cinch for the

Referee Davis warned Archer

for rough work and in the second half
ordered him to leave the floor. The

up a howl and said the team would-

. Fencing Team

G. W. Postgate, Noted Fencing Expert, Wishes to Take Charge;
Application Will Be Made to Intercollegiate
Association if Project is Success

At the monthly meeting of the Ath-
letic Committee last week, the mat-
ter of a fencing team was brought up
and after a lengthy discussion it was‘
decided to give this sport a trial. Mr
G. W. Postgate, Instructor of Fencing
at the Pittsburgh Aztliletic Association
start-ed this movement andits success
rests with the sport loving contingent
of the University. Fencing is one of
the best developed and scientiﬁc sports
of the present age and the thing
about it that appeals most to students
is the fact that
plays a secondary part to agility and
adroitness while the requisites of
other sports such as nerve and train-
ing must be had to becom-e a fencer.

Mr. Postga.te’s plan in starting a
fencing club in the University is to
get a membership of about ﬁfteen or
twenty men, preferably sophomores
or freshmen, and give them free les-
sons twice a week. He believes he
could develop a good team by the
latter part of March and then would

arrange a match with oneor more ofiwho signify their desire to take up this

the members of the Intercollegiate
Fencing Association either on our own
floor or away. An application for
membership would then be, tendered
this association and several fencing
experts believe that Pitts-burgh would
be admitted. The men who took up
the sport this year would be expected
to continue next year and art that time
pay ten or ﬁfteen dollars per year for
-two lessons a week. The fencing
wouldexcuse a man from the required
gym work and receive the credits (one
per term) given athletes. ‘

If you are interested see Director
Miller or Mr. Postg.at-e at the P. A. A
clubhouse at once, asthis matter must
be settled. It is thought that the
fencing lessons could be given at the
P. A. A. clubhouse until Pitt’s new
gym is completed. Following is a let-
ter from Mr. Postgate that explains
the matter fully:

Pittsburgh, Pa., Feb. 5th,
My Dear Mr. Miller: ,

From the conversation I had with you
recently, you understand that it is my
desire to introduce fencing in the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, but in order that
you may place the matter concisely be-
fore your Athletic Committee, I believe
it is advisable to make a brief outline
of the proposition. ‘

There is an Intercollegiate Fencing
Association, composed of fencing clubs
at West Point, Annapolis, University of
Pennsylvania, Columbia, Yale, Harvard,
Princeton and Cornell. Each of these
colleges engages the services of a fenc-
ing instructor, and fencing is recognized
as one of the minor sports, due credit
being given for attending the fencing
class in lieu of compulsory gymnastics.

Each member of these fencing classes,
or clubs,~is eligible to make the fencing
team to represent the college. These
teams are composed of the three best
fencers, with two or three substitutes,
and they have meetings with all the
college teams in the league, traveling to
some of them, and entertaining others
on the home grounds. When a member
of the team wins against another col-
and for
the championships, a. varsity emblem is
awarded. The cha pionships are held
ork at the Hotel

191-2.

secure much publicity. Last year Cor-

physical strength -

{ly obliged to you.

Jiell won the team and individual cham-
pionships.

The fencing clubs are usually com-
posed of thirty to ﬁfty men who are in-
terested in the sport of fencing, and in
some of the colleges, Pennsylvania, for
instance, each one pays the Fencing In-
structor ten to ﬁfteen dollars per season
for coaching twice a week. They meet
themselves another afternoon a week,
making three classes a week. It is cus-
tomary for ‘the college to make an ap-
propriation sufficient to cover all, or
part, of the traveling expenses of the
team. ,

Owing to the dropping out of the
league of the Massachusetts Technical
School, there is one vacancy, and no
more, unless they can secure twelve col-
leges, nine and twelve being the req-
uisite numbers. To enter this league a
college must show that they are actu-
ally interested in fencing by meeting
two or three of the teams. '

It is my opinion that a Fencing Club
or class can be formed in your Uni-
versity, and that they can enter the
league, if action is taken immediately,
as I have been in correspondence with
some of the fencers who are deeply in-
terested in college fencing. ' , ‘

If you will bring this matter before
the Athletic Committee, I shall be great-
My idea is to pick
out a dozen likely young men, freshmen,

sport, and to train them twice a week,
they meeting by. themselves another
afternoon. By the end of March I could
have some fair fencers, who’ would make
a good showing against the other C01-
leges. Arrangements could then be
made either to have them visit a couple
of the colleges to show their \mettle, or
to bring on a couple of teams from out-
side colleges and have tournaments in
this city. Then I am fully convinced
that entrance to the big league could be
gained.

For my services I would not ask any-
thing for this season, but would wish to
pledge the men I train to help me form
a class or club next winter, each mem-
ber of which would pay me ten or ﬁf-
teen dollars for two lessons a. week for
the entire season.

The German Club of this city now has

an active fencing section, and so has‘

this organization. Also, I believe that
the Turn-Verein, some of the Y. M. C.
A.’s and private clubs will take up this
sport next season. This will all be of
"assistance to the fencers of the Uni-
versity, giving them plenty of practice.

Knowing that the University of Pitts-
burgh is building a newgymn-asium, and
endeavoring in every way to place itself
on an equal footing with the best col-
leges, as a resident of Pittsburgh and a
devotee of fencing, I sincerely’ trust
that the Athletic Committee will con-
sider this matter favorably.

Very truly yours, G. W. POSTGATE,

Fencing Instructor, 1?. A. A.

DEATH SA.DDENS STUDENTS.

 

(Continued from Page 1)

The deceased was age-d nineteien
years and three months. His noble
qualities of mind and character won
friends for him wherever he went. His
friends have often said that it was im-
possible to associate Henry with any-
thing mean or unbecoming the char-
acter of -the true gentleman. During
his High School course and while piir
suing his studies at Pitt, he had the
highest respect of his instructors and
He took an intense in-
terest in all the affairs of the Uni-
versity and undoubtedly a more loyal
, As secretary
of the Chartiers Valley Pitt Club he
was willing to sacriﬁce his most val-
uable time in boosting Pitt. To those
who had the good fortune to be inti-
mately acquainte-d with him, it seemed
as if his whole hear-t was in Pitt and
her brilliant future. He had been look-
ing forward for several months to tilt’
anniversary celebration and "was pre-
paring to take an active part in the

exercises and festivities of the occa-
sion.
The loss of such a stu-dent with

such a bright future before him will
be felt for. a long time among the in-

structors and the undergraduates of’
-the Univ-ersity. On Sunday afternoon‘

the body was taken from the home tv
the Evangelical Lutheran Church of
Carnegie, where the funeral services
were held. His‘ pastor, Rev. Dittiner
who conducted the services, paid a fit-
ting tribute to the character of-the
he. had
watched Henry in the performance of
his -daily tasks .aiid how the latter had
impressed him as being one who was
satisﬁed with nothing less than per-
fection in all things. Chancellor Mc-
Cormick, who, together with several

members of the faculty and a large-

number of the undergraduates, at-

tended the services, was called upon;

to speak a few words.
The Chancellor said in part:
“All that Rev. Dittmer has
concerning the deceased and his thor-
ough way of doing things, corresponds
to our experiences with Mr. Laun and
his work. Although I did not hair?

the pleasure of being personally ac-‘}

quaintedwith him, the professors tell
me that they -believe no other student
in the entire University stood higher
in his class room work than did he.”

After -the services the body was re-
moved to the Lutheran Cemetery for
interment.

members of the family in their be-
reavement.

STATEMENT ON DEATH
. OF HENRY LAUN

 

On account of the numerous and
contradictory reports which have
gained curr-ent concerning t=he death
of Mr. Laun, it seems desirable to
make "a public-statementof the facts
as nearly as they can be ascertained.

I was notiﬁed shortly after the event
and went at once to the Pittsburgh
Transformer Company’s plant in lower
Allegheny. , » ~ '

Mr. Laun had been at work about
three quarters of an hour at testing a
large transformer. He had climbed to
the top of the case, some eight or nine
feet high, by means of a ladder, and
was standing on the ‘flat top stooping
down preparatory to taking a temper-
ature reading of the oil contained in
the case. For some reason which can
never be known he fell, turning as ‘hr
did so in such a manner that he lay
on his back across the «top of the
tank. When he struck, his head came
into contact with a live wire and if
death had not already come to him
he died instantly from this contact.

Everything possible was done in an
effort to resuscitate him, the men and
doctors working an hour and .a ‘half
before giving up.
