Pat Teeters Names
Reasons For Student
Senate Resignation

By JIM NELSON
Pat Teeters named personal and
organizational reasonsvfor her re-
signation as vice-president of Stu-

3000 Still

Must Register
For Next Term

Over 3000 students have not yet
completed registration and will be
charged the late fee of one dollar
per credit up to 15 credits, ac-
cording to statistics released by
the Office of Student Records
Monday.

“People who don’t want to face
the lines on January 2, and be at
the bottom of the ‘pile for class
selection should hurry and re-
gister now,” advised Anthony
Athens, assistant director of stu-
dent records. c

The statistics show that the
bulk of the late registrations are
in the School of General Studies,
with 1,458 remaining as of Mon-
day. The two largest schools,

Liberal Arts and Engineering

and Mines, lack only 243 and

164, respectively.

Athens stated that this number
of,_1-ate registrants can be consid-
ered as being even lower, sub-
tracting students who will grad-
uate at the end of this trimester
or not return to school for other
reasons.

However, students who have
not yet completed their course
election should do so before the
ﬁnal day, January 2, 1962, for
their own convenience and bene-
ﬁt.

dent Government and president of
the Student Senate.

In accounting her reasons to
The Pitt News after she had ex-
plained them in a closed Senate
meeting Monday, Teeters said that
the personal factors involving her
resignation were health and lower
grades.

Concerning the organization,
Miss Teeters emphasized that a
student government, has a place
on this campus and that it should
be important.

Feels Strongly for SG

“I don’t believe that it can exist
in its present form when the main
c o n s c i o u s form is building
strength for existence. If anyone
has a strong feeling for SG, I
have,” she said.

“The present organization is
not as strong as it should be,”
she added. “The Senate should
put themselves second to SG,
laying aside status’ and ego
needs, and set up a government
that is representative, being sure
to include those people who are
the top leaders.”

Teeters stated that she didn’t
feel that she was the backbone of
Student Government, or that pro-
gress toward reorganization has
been hindered or helped by her
resignation.

Ten Members Vote

“The Gavel Club is currently
working on an idea which they
plan to submit to the ‘committee
for reorganization.” Miss Teeters
said. “I think that it is a good
idea that many plans for reor-
ganization be submitted, so that
they can take the best of all
the ideas submitted.”

At the meeing of the Senate,
a. motion was passed that voting

highlighted by a ﬂoor show by
Ernie Bastin’s band featuring their
rhythm section which was award-
ed top honors at the Washington,
D.C. Jazz Festival last May.

general dance chairman, “ticket
sales are coming along just ﬁne,
and the dance should be a wonder-
ful experience for all.

“Invitations have even ex-
tended to all the graduate stu-
dents, and we hope that they
will join with all undergradu-
ates to make this a most suc-
cessful ‘All University Christmas
Ball!.”

The decorations for the Cathe-
dral will include “many colored-
lights, spangled cones, a brightly
ornamented Christmas tree, and
sprigs of mistletoe hung in cer-
tain ‘inconspicuous’ places.”

Fraternities Join

The Tuck Shop will be kept
open so that students might enjoy
a short snack during intermission.

The hosts for the dance will

Tickets have been made availa-
ble to fraternity men through their

Ogden Nash‘.
Closes Midday
Series Today

Ogden Nash will recite some of
his “deliberately bad verse" and
comment on the events that led to
their creation at today’s Midday
Series.

The humorist and social satirist
started out selling bonds “and in
two years sold one bond — to my
godmother,” and then moved on
to Doubleday’s advertising de-
partment where he began to
doodle some verses.

Besides writing books of light
verse such as “I’m a Stranger
Here Myself,” Nash wrote the
lyrics for the Broadway musical,
“One Touchof Venus” with hum-
orist S. J. Perelman, and wrote
the verse which accompanies
Columbia Records’ best selling
“Carnival of the Animals.”

This is the last of this tri-

mester’s Midday presentations.

Greeks Plan
New Fraternity
Newspaper

Interfraternity Council has an-
nounced that they will again pub-
lish an interfraternity newspaper
this year.

Called the “IF Messenger,” it;
will be a four page, linotyped
publication edited by Harold
Tkach, Lambda Chi Alpha. Bob
Rowley of Sigma Chi will be
business manager. I

According to Tkach, the paper,
which will come out once this
trimester, “will be improved a,
thousand percent over last year’s
mimeographed editions. Our big-
g€S’£ problem is getting co-opera-
tion from the fraternities,” he
said.

Explains Need

Tkach explained why an inter-
ffaternity newspaper is needed.
“We feel that the fraternity sys-
tem here at the University lacks
communication among the member
organizations and with the rest of
the campus,” the new editor said.

“This paper will help the fra-
ternities support the council
more.”

The newspaper’s primary func-
tion will be public relations, ac-
cording to the Council’s plans.
“We will try to show that fra-
ternity men are something dif-
ferent.” Publicizing fraternity life
to those eligible to join a fra-
ternity will be a concern of the
editor.

Publicize Sports

Some of the features will be a
page listing the activities of the
different chapters, a pledge col-
umn, a feature on outstanding
fraternity men, and front page
on fraternity-sponsored
aﬁ'airs such as Greek Week and
Rush.

The paper will be used to
publicize the faternity sports
Programs to the rest of the Uni-
versity.

Honor

Bandsman

James S. Semple
Awarded Trophy
By Marching Band

James S. Semple, Engin, Sr., has

:been selected as the Outstanding

Bandsman of the year. Semple, a
bass drum player, is local vice
president of Kappa Kappa Psi,
national honorary fraternity for
college bandsmen.

The Alpha Omega chapter of
this fraternity presents the Out-
standing Bandsman of the Year
Award annually to a Varsity

Marching Band member who, “in
the opinion of all his fellow

’ bandsmen, excels in his individual

contribution toward the overall
goal of the band.”

Three qualities considered in
the selection of the Outstanding
Bandsmen of the Year are mu-
sical ability, marching ability,
and spiritual coperation with
other band members.

“The band does not aim at per-
fection for musical and marching
ability, but it does try to foster
a fine. displ.ay of both, and to
have its members strive to attain
this.”

The bandsman shows spiritual
cooperation by a “display of lead-
ership and common sense, good
attendance at rehearsals, helping
to ‘break-in’ new men, working
on special projects such as the
band newspaper, receptions for
visiting bands, other projects, and
getting along with other band
members.”

Bandsman of the Year is made
from ﬁve nominees, chosen by

is informed of who the recipient

Having served four years in the
band, Semple has been drum sec-
tion leader, a pledge-master, and
chairman of the reception for pa-
rents of band members at the
West Virginia game. Upon re-
ceiving the award, Semple said
that he was “extremely proud and
deeply honored.” t

Artificial Trees
Urged at Holiday

William G. Fisher, director of
the University Physical plant, has
warned organizations who plan to
use Christmas decorations to ad-
here to the safety precautions re-
commended by the City of Pitts-
burgh Fire Department.

If a Christmas tree is contem-
plated, Fisher has asked the group
to use artiﬁcial trees wherever
possible and to hold the number
of live trees to a minimum. If
live trees are to be used, the
Department of Buildings and

Grounds wishes .. to be notiﬁed.

Monopoly Contest

‘Grinds To

A Halt’

The most famous Monopoly game ever played came to

a halt last Saturday at Sigrna Alpha Mu’s yearly dinner

when the vice president of Parker Brothers, Randolph Bar-
ton, made the ﬁnal roll of the dice, as members of SAM, the
president of their national chapter, and a LIFE photographer

looked on. 0

The results showed the team.
of Finkel and Leeds holding as-
sets of $146,000, compared to
Paulenoﬁ and Fogel’s mere $133,-
000. ‘

At the dinner, held at the Penn-
Sheraton Hotel, Parker’s vice
president gave the fraternity a
special embossed wooden edition
of “Monopoly.” The toy ﬁrm is
also sending SAM 100 assorted
games, which will be distributed

-Howie Fogel, a member of
the losing team, emphasized
that, contrary to earlier reports,
they did not continue the game
so long so “that it won’t tempt
us during cram sessions,” main-
Jly because all of the fraternity
‘members “have been studying
all along, and don't have to
cram for ﬁnals.”

“I’m glad the game is over,”
Fogel reported, “even though our
team lost." He said that the tra-
ternity members had been play-
ing monopoly games for quite a
while, along with bridge, but that
the contests had seldom lasted

much longer than an hour.

“There will be no rematch, at
least not until after the end of
this‘ trimester,” the gracious loser
declared.

Alph:Pl1i Omega
Taps, Six Pledges

The Beta Chapter of Alpha Phi
Omega, national honorary service
fraternity, initiated six new
pledges into the fraternity at a
banquet held last Friday night.

The six initiated were Roger
Barna, Louis Blumengarten, Den-
nis Hammerle, Ben Liebtag, John
Mihaly and Dan Frbovich.

In addition to the pledge initia-
tions, the new ofﬁcers and ad-
visors of, Beta Chapter were also
installed in their positions.

Dr. Crafts was installed as head
of the advisory committee and
William Repack as active chapter
advisor.

Robert Zeigler, Dave Gance, and

A University researcher claims
that computers are becoming
status symbols in some corpora-
tions, which obtain them for the
sole purpose of proving that they;

DR. LIONEL C. KNIGHTS, visiting‘ Andrew
Mellon professor of English, spoke at Monday's
Midday Series and again at the afternoon coffee

tion of the Shakespearian drama. The local pro- A
duction, in the Stephen Foster auditorium, will

are as equally progressive as their
competitors. V

“Our technology has developed
machines which not only can com- A
pute at fantastic speeds. but VVhlCh§
are capable of memorizing en0r—l
mous amounts of knowledge andf
proving complex theories,” ob-
served Dr. Mark Alt'andary-Alex-
ander, assistant professor of in-
dustry and a specialist in opera-
tions research.

Alexander claims that if the
machine is used for only one
operation. such as payroll auto-
mation, it is being operated only
at a fraction of its potential. He
also feels that in firms which use
them strictly as a symbol, com-
puters can become a liability
rather than an asset.

The professor is particularl_v§
concerned with the fact that the‘
status seekers, through their un-g
wise use of computers may debase
the true value of the machines.

“The old joke about the man
who became president of his firm
when someone in golf shoes
stepped on his computer card may
become more than funny. It may
become true.”

Computers, along with their
ability to speed the advancement
of modern man, pose a grave
problem. Alexander thinks.

“Our technical prowess has out-
stripped the development of social
responsibility. We need greater
emphasis on education in the hu-
manities and social sciences."

Examining Exam:

The present system of scheduling ﬁnal exams is unsat-

isfactory. Exams based on individual teacher preference

just do not work, as evidenced by the end of the term

i chaos now prevalent in many areas of the University.

For those teachers who have adjusted their schedules
to a one hour exam sometime during the last week of
school, few problems have arisen. But for those teachers
who still believe in the two or three hour comprehensives,
the resulting conflicts only hinder the advantages of such a
system. ’

Speciﬁcally, the language department has scheduled
two hour exams for the Saturday before school closes. This
exam time, however, does not fall during the regular class

time. It is in addition to the three to ﬁve hours of classes

the student must attend during the week. Therefore, the
student must not only put in additional time to take the
exam, but he must also subtract that time from any other
course for which he must study. T

In the second place, in many instances, the Saturday
exam schedule conﬁicts with regular Saturday classes. This
means that students who have Saturday morning classes
in other subjects must be excused from these classes or
they must schedule make-up exams, putting an extra bur-
den on both teacher and student in either case.

A third problem involves those students who have
purposely arranged their schedules to eliminate Saturday
classes because of working commitments. A

Realizing some of these diﬂiculties, a number of teac-h-
ers have arranged for a week’s reading time before the
exam as in the Social Sciences. These teachers dismiss
their classes for the three hours remaining in the term ex-
clusive of the exam day. This system, as the other, could
work ﬁne,ibut it, like the above, needs the co-operation
of other teachers and other departments. The extra hour
given three times that week barely gives a student time
to read an introduction before he must hurry to another
class which has not been dimissed. Is it any wonder stu-
dents are confused? , «

If the administration has decided to eliminate a ﬁnals
week, which it obviously has, then it is timefaculty mem-

bers‘ adjust to the situation and forget the two-hour com- ’

prehensives in favor of the one hour test, or they combine
their efforts for a single comprehensive method. This year’s
situation emphasizes the need for a systematized ﬁnal ex-
am schedule. ‘

Trials Of Turkey

By Ismail B. Turksen

When we look at the globe, we see many ﬁres
burning on it. Algeria against France; the Congo
in pieces within itself; Soviet Russia coveting Fin-
land; Castro’s Cuba becoming a cancer in the West-
ern hemisphere. These are just a few examples of
the unrest all over the world. There have been a
number of revolutions in the
Middle East within the past few
years. Iraq has embraced social-
ism; Egypt has had trouble with
Syria, culminating in the disso-
lution of the United Arab Re-
public. It seems that the people
of Asia Minor had to have their
sharein this global unrest.

7 From 1920, Turkey has striv-
en for a better social and politi-
cal structure of its own. Since
that time, it has made a few
overwhelming strides toward such a structure. The
imperial order of the Sultans was replaced with the
Republic of Turkey, a ﬂedgling nation in whichlthe
tension between Western and Eastern cultures was
rife. For a time-, this tension was temporarily ab-
sorbed by the commanding leadership of Kemal
Ataturk, the first President of the Republic.

Necessary Evil

A one-party system was a ‘necessary evil at that
time. Since the people were, for the most part, ‘un-
educated, they were unable to adjust to a multi-
party system; nor were they able to adjust to the
changes inherent in the birth of a republic. Be-
cause of the forcetulness of Atatu1‘k’s personality
and his great leaedrship, the people seemed to be
in accord with his principles. One could doubt
whether these principles were ever really under-
stood. Since the ignorance of the majority is a fact,
one might conjecture that they merely followed
sheep‘—like without genuine awareness of the path
they were taking, or its possible consequences. A
few decades passed and the political leaders hope-
fully thought that the country was in a state of
accepting and adjusting itself to the multi-party
system -—— a touchstone of any democratic republic.

In 1945, under the leadership of Imonu, the sec-
ond president of. the Republic, the multi-party sys-
tem had its inception. Within five years, new par-

 

ties were installed; and the first free elections were
held in 1950. This was the critical year in which

the Democrats took control of the Turkish Parlia-
ment with a great majority. The future looked rosy" I
—~for a while! Then the unprepared condition of ,

the people became evident. If we add to this the
shrewd intelligence of a certain category of lead-,
ers, the stage is set for the dissatisfaction and the
unrest in which people are capable of being ex-
ploited. I
While this exploitation of the innocent and ig-

noi-ant continued, the educated portion of the pop- 
ulation started to react to conditions as they really...
were, and not to conditions as they were assumed»;
to be. Lack of economic planning, coupled with the) .
rise of modern industry, led to an inﬂationary peri. 

od in which earnings failed to balance with ex’.

find their voice in the student segment of thelpopu- 

lation. As student protests became more vocal, gov-

ernment leaders attempted to suppress the opposi-iii:

tion to national policy. On May 27, 1960, the situa.
tion ﬁnally exploded. The Government was over.
thrown and Turkey was under a military regime
for sixteen months. It was a bloodless -revolution,
but its effects were none the less intense.

Aware of Danger

Turkey now finds herself in the position where‘

a small portion of her leaders are aware of the
dangers of exploitation and oligarchy; but these

men are hampered in their efforts to move toward

true democracy by those politicians who base their

appeal on the ignorance and superstition, of the un-

educated masses wholare tied to the old traditions.
Current tensions are no longer expressive of a
clash between Eastern and Western cultures;

rather. they are the inevitable result of a lack of_

understanding and common goals between a grow-
ing and educated city population, on the onelhand,
and an uneducated and traditional country popu-
IHHOI1, on the other. Turkey’s coalition government
is an attempt to compromise the two segments of

A the p0Dulation — one clinging to the traditional,

and the other advocating modern industrial growth.
Only the future can attest to Turkey's ability to ab-
S0l‘b Change and to grow accordingly. Her inability
to do so will inevitably place Turkey among those
troubled areas in which revolution becomes a fact
of life.

Twenty Years After

‘ Editor’s Note:
amliversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl

Tomorrow is the twentieth
Harbor. In recognition of this occasion, we are
repm'nting the following article which appeared.
in the December 10, 1941 issue of The Pitt
News.
T It was a sunless day, a grey day all around.
Students,
were anxious to say Something about It not quite

more restless in classes than ever,
sure of what they wanted to say.
A new meaning was given to the phrase, “Facts
of Life.” I
Grim young faces, calm, serious, indicated that
bo_vs had suddenly become men, girls had become

'WOl’l’l€n.

It was a day when professors whose lectures
consisted of Time’s circulation ﬁgures for 1940, of
the value of insulin in treating psychological dis-
eases, of the decline of the Holy Roman Empire
met only with inattention, forgetting, squirming in
chairs.

The clipped voice of a radio announcer could be
heard in, The Pitt News office, in room 132, invthe
Faculty club at regular intervals‘: “We interrupt
this program to bring you a Special news bulletin.
Nicaragua has just . . .”

Rhythmic Dirge

Through the half-open window of a ground floor
classroom came the rhythmi{c’dirge of four little
newsboys walking the avenue and chorusing over
and over again, “War! War! War!”

It Was 3 day When University students with
brothers in Pearl Harbor, students with friends
who were called back from furloughs, were at once
aware of the horrible value of radio, of the tele-
gram. . _

Remarks like “Let's go out and get soused,” “I
feel awful let down,” and the lack of remarks on
the part of some testified to a sense of futility. The
silence which greeted the playing of the national

S anthem, the eyes narrowed to slits, the hands tight-

en-ed till the knuckles showed white testiﬁed to an-

other attitude —— assured determinatiori./

One professor helped to lessen the tenseness by
reading to his class for 15 minutes a Mark Twain
children’s story. Another told hisiaudience he pitied
them —— “them” the youth who didn’t know where
they W91“? §Oing, who had given up trying to un-
derstand. Still another lectured for his full hour
on the formula of a contemporary novel; it was 9:30
in the morning, and his students stared dully at the

I dots on the lecturer’s tie.

It was the day when the Tuck Shop politicians
were in their glory; when the wide-eyed glamour
girls Seemed Strangely laughable when they coyly
asked “is it really so-o-o seeryus?”

There Was 3 growing maturity on campus, and
the elevator jokes fell ﬂat.

Instead of “I’ve been Workin’ on the Railroad,”
Stﬁudent V0l‘3eS gave out with the comparative val-
ues of dive-bombers, pursuit planes, subs.

Sky-Gazers

P€0Dle looked out the windows at the greying
Skies, punctuated with the orange ﬂame of the steel
mills, and each mind nursed a different thought.
Snowﬂakes were whipped around the Cathedral. by
a stubborn wind and students stayed late, sat look-
 into the Commons room ﬁres, or silently sip-
ping black coffee. I

Noone could concentrate on a book more than
ten minutes. .

It was 3 day. when radio announcers’ voices
cracked with emotion.

It was the day that Jeanette Rankin of Montana
was the only negative voice among 470 ayes.
‘ It was the day Chancellor John Bowman said.
‘We have here at Pitt as intelligent a group of stu-
dents 35 you can DOSSibly get. It is a well organized

fact that mtelligence. common sense and integrity

are all in one bundle. The most optimistic thing
that I know of in Pittsburgh is the character of the
student body here. Tomorrow and tomorrow is 3
black out, but the students will find their way
through.”

  
     

 

Rennie-wt of ‘Daughter of Silence’
’ Dialogue, Commentary

‘Blemish’ West Novel  

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

The new novel by Morris

L. West, Daughter of Silence

(William Morrow and Company; 275 pp.; $3.95), has also been
written as a play. And when reading the book, one wonders
if he has not picked up the script by mistake.

The author of the highly-praised_best-seller, The Devil’s
Advocate, has written an exciting, melodramatic story which
is blemished with several ‘theatri-O‘ '

cal devices. The devices do not

* ‘smother the power of the story,

but they do persist annoyingly
throughout the entire length‘ of
the novel. ’

The first of these blemishes is
the dialogue. The speeches of the
characters in the story show a
great deal of cleverness and care
on the part of the author, but
they are too epigrammatic, too
forceful for a long narrative. In
the courtroom scenes the speeches
are dramatic and effective, but in
the many romantic and philoso-
phical conversations they appear
to be just what they are: speeches.

Insults Reader

The second haw in the novel

is the author’s ultra-omniscent

commentary. His exposition reads.

like the stage directions of Shaw
or Miller: perceptive and enter-
taining in itself. .

But West leaves very little to
the reader's imagination; in-
deed he practically insults the
reader by constantly explain-
ing what a ‘character has said,
how he felt about saying it,.
and how he looked when he
said it. In a script, this informa-
tion is necessary to an actor,
but in such quantity in 3
novel, it antagonizes the read-
er.

"Aside from these annoyances,

Daughter of Silence is as com-
pelling a mystery story as was
its famed predecessor. The book
begins with the arrival of a young
girl, Anna Albertini, at a sleepy
little Italian Village.
Lawyer Intervenes

Then the ex-resident of the
town violently shatters the peace-
fulness of the countryside by gun-
ning down the mayor, Gianbat-
tista Belloni. She follows this by
turning herself immediately over
to the police.

A young, inexperienced law-
yer decides to defend the dis-

man with enough troubles of
his own; he takes the challeng-
ing case to prove his salt to his
unfaithful wife and his father-

The fascinating, inquisltional

needed respect of his senior

it does make entertaining fiction.

l on the ﬁnal plan for a reorgan-
ized SG will be up to the ten
Senate members on the commit-
tee for the reorganization of SG.
The ﬁnal plan will then be pre-
sented to the Senate for ap-
proval.

Jay Fingeret, president of the
Senate, felt that voting should be
restricted to the senators be-
cause theyare supposed to ex‘-
press the opinions of the student
body. “Other people should ex-
press their opinions through” the
senators,” he said.

He added also that there have
been occurrences at the meetings
of the reorganization committee
that have changed his mind about
the original open student body
planning of SG.

Fingeret said that the meetings
will still be open to the entire
student body, but that the ﬁnal
decision will be up to the sen-
ators on the committee.

Discuss Old Business

By JUDY

Although the song of the theatre world is supposed to
be “The Show Must Go On,” perhaps the song “Nobody
Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen” would be just as appropriate.

During the preparations forthe opening performance of
the University Theatre’s production of “Julius Caesar” the
problems backstage never seemed to end.

MEISLIK

The Senate moved -to continue
the SG-sponsored Polaris, a stu-
dent handbook and guide. There
was a question of the legality
of obtaining pictures from
coming students before they have
come to the University to live

in-

The night before the opening;
one of the most important actors,
Len Goodman, got sick and the
story of the poor understudy
waiting in the wings came true
with a few twists.

Hairdos Problem

The understudy wasn’t waiting
in the wings, he was the director
and he’ll admit that he was scar-
ed.

That was not the only problem
which had to be handled. Philip
Eek, in charge of costumes, won-
dered how a Roman matron can
have a bouffant hairstyle and how
could all of the girls in the cast
want to look like Jackie?

Eek, taking no back seat to Dior
quickly designed the latest in
classical chapeaux to cover the
hair styles of today. ,

» Lights Off

Now that the Romans looked
Roman and the director looked
scared someone had to turn on
the lights, but the apparatus had
burned out and no parts could be
obtained in time. _

The electrical geniuses of the
University Theatre came through
and lights could be turned on
even if the technician had -to
wear insulated gloves.

Finally the performance is to go
before an audience of ﬁfteen at
the ﬁnal dress rehearsal and stage
fright does set in.

Barnhardt Shows

In this case the nervous actress
suddenly becomes Sarah Bern-
hardt with more B emotion, but
she’ll become the best one in the
play after a few tranquilizers and
opening night. A

Nobody sitting in the audi-
ence during the ﬁnal dress re-
hearsal was aware of the many
problems faced backstage be-
cause what they saw was a
smooth and effective perform‘-
ance.

Caesar, played by Harvey
Miller, performed as the head of
the great Roman army and em-
pire should perform. Although
the audience might have felt
Caesar dederved to die, they
were saddened by the loss of
Miller from the play.

The lighting went well and
proved deserving of all the time
that the technical staﬁ had put

not outstanding. It blended into
the play as a set “ought to.

Judging from the performance
given in the dress rehearsal
“Julius Caesar” is well Worth the
time, effort, and tribuation that
went into production and well
worth student attendance.

Con Artist

To West Virginia I]. 

Raul Garibay, the conﬁdence
man who bilked Pittsburgh stu-
dents out of at least $21 last

week by posing as a representa-
tive of various foreign student or-
ganizations, has moved his game
to Morgantown, West Virginia.

Last Saturday, using the name
of this University’s International
Club, he took three students at
West Virginia University ‘for five
dollars each.

Renee Lichenstein, University
advisor to foreign students, said
that a man called on the for-
eign student advisor at WVU
last Saturday and said he was
a representative of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh’s Interna-
tional Club. He used Miss
Lichenstein’s name as a refer-
ence.

The WVU advisor gave him a
list of foreign students enrolled
there. Later, she found that he
conned three of them out of ﬁve
dollars each. “He sounded so con-
vincing,” the advisor at WVU
said.

Miss Lichenstein has contact-
ed the National Association of
Foreign Student Advisors and

Book Policy Criticism

Dispute Centers

On English Texts

By BARRY GROSS .
Men’s Council’s criticism of the
University Book Store’s used book
policy was answered Monday by
Paul Boltacz, manager of the Book

‘ Center.

Criticism had centered over the
Freshman English text, which the
bookstore bought used from stu-
dents for ﬁfty cents and sold for
half their new price. ‘

Boltacz explained that this was
an exceptional case, because, at
that time, the English Department
had notiﬁed the Book Store that
they were not going to use the
text again.

“According to Bid”

“Since we thought it wasn’t to
be used here, we bought the used
copies according to the bid esta-
blished by the wholesaler,’’ he
said. “After we had bought all the
copies we could, the English De-
partment informed us that they
had reconsidered and decided to
use that text again, after all.”

Since very few campuses use
that particular text, the store
and the wholesaler were taking
a large risk buying used copies
at any price, when they thought
the book was no longer to be
used here, the manager contin-
ued.

After again giving the basic
formula for used books in good
condition -—.- bought from the stu-
dents at 50 per cent of original
cost if in good condition, and sold
at 75 per cent of original cost—-
Boltacz defined what the store
considers bad condition for a book,
which brings a very low price to
the seller

Students Pay

“The worst abuse for a book is
for its spine to be broken,” Bol-
tacz said. “No one will buy a book
in that condition. Underlining
throughout a book in otherwise
good condition will not lessen its
value, but marginal notes will.’’

“The student who abuses a
book must pay the consequences
by only receiving a light value
for it when he sells it,” he said.

Boltacz felt that the Student

Book Exchange would not cut the
store’s used book trade since there
will always be students who pre-
fer ready cash to waiting for a
better sale at the exchange.
“But more power to those
who can sell their books through
the exchange at higher prices,”

he emphasized. I must be fair to
the student who is selling me a
book,.but I have a greater re-
sponsibility to those who buy
used books.”

“If ‘it appears that we are

.overtly discouraging used book

trade, perhaps we are to be con-
gratulated,” Boltacz concluded.

“The student who feels it isn’t
worth while to sell a book will
decide to‘ keep it and thus add
to his personal library.”

“It Goes On..."

MUTUAL ADMIRATION so(:1E'rY
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.—-—-

Most of the young lions on Pitt’s basketball team got the
impression that Purdue’s Terry Dischinger was a gloriﬁed,
bawling belly—acher, who was pampered by the refs, and
plays a pretty fair brand of ball.

In the dressing room, up close, he is a refreshing, articu-
late fellow, sparse of frame, with an almost boyish zest for
conversation. His face was well-scrubbed after a post-game
shower, but the soap bar failed to erase the red bruises
which ﬂushed his gaunt forehead.

Work on Wells

The rebounding battles under the Big Ten boards are
legendary, and the bruisers of Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota,
et al, are notorious for producing welts on “Dish’s” dome.

“That’s what the poets claim in their sports columns,”
Dischinger claimed, “but I get my worst beatings against
Pitt. Last year I had black and blue marks on me for a
month after I played in Pittsburgh!”

“That John Fridley must have his elbows honed on
a blacksmith’s grinding wheel. He caught me on both
cheeks on one particular play.” Dischinger’s chameleon
face broke into a wide grin when he said, “But I guess
that you have to expect things like that.”

“They were beating us bad1y~ under the boards tonight,’~’
Dischinger added. “They were running us under the boards
in the first half when they were grabbing more than us, but
then we started knockin’ ’em down.”

“That boy with all the muscles, the one that looks like
some Greek mythological character, (Brian) Generalovich,
is really something,” the bright Boilermaker said. “He’s like
a brick wall that smiles at you!”

Still A Challenge '

Dischinger stated that college ball is still stimulating to
him, despite having played on the Olympic team in Rome,
and receiving all the hoopla in the papers. “lt’s still a chal-
lenge,” he said. “That redhead who was watching me tonight
(Paul Kreiger) is going to be real good. He’s got good moves
and he’s tough oﬁ the boards. But he didn’t get the ballmuch
to shoot.

Pitt’s better this year,” he exclaimed, “They’re real
aggressive oﬂ’ the boards, and they have better indi-
viduals. You’ll see your team get better real soon.”

“I thought that number ﬁfty—ﬁve was gonna kill me,”
the Purdue center remarked. “He really came after me in
those last couple of minutes!” Dischinger was referring to
Ken “The Crusher” Hepworth, a New Hampshire bruiser
with a Mike McKeever elbow.

After Hepworth delivered a deft blow to Dischinger’s
diaphragm, the Terre Haute lad rebuked him for the as-
sault. “You shouldn’t do that!” Dischinger hollered in the
tone of a Southern mansion nanny.

Address of Respect
“OK, Mr.‘Dischinger,” Hepworth apologized sarcastically.
On Hepworth, Purdue Coach Ray Eddy said, “Did he
ever study karate?” >
Despite the hurly burly of thumps and grunts, Disch-

inger remains as powerful as the eye of hurricane with
the swirling humanity aroundhim. Still, he doesn’t feel
that he’ll play any professional ball.

“No, I’Ve got two years in the Army coming up,” the
ROTC private explained. “And then I’d like to go to graduate
school.” Dischinger is an honor student in chemical engineer-
ing, and once seriously considered entering the ministry. “It
sort of drifted away from my mind though,” he said.

Likes Lucas

Dischinger speaks only in superlatives when discussing
Big Ten rival Jerry Lucas, to whom he is constantly compar-
ed. The big Buckeye center who was a teammate of Lucas on
the Olympic squad, thinks that Dischinger is the best, and
Terry returns the compliment.

“He’s a lot nicer to play with, than against,” Terry
said. “You know why he’s great, because he’s a worker,
plus he’s intelligent.”

Dischinger soothed his forehead with his large left hand,
saying, “Boy, it hurts again tonight.” Then he left, truly an
All-American boy.

As Surprise

The freshman hoopsters
open the 1961-62 home basket-
ball season Saturday at the
Field House. Carnegie Tech’s
Plebes will provide the oppo-
sition for the Pitt team in a
game that starts at 6:15 p.m. C

The Panther Cubs go into the
ball game with a 1-0 record after
their victory over Johnstown Cen-
ter College last week. In that en-
counter, Brian Fisher. proved him-
self to be a valuable all-around
player, as he led the Pitt scoring
with 25 points. “Fisher not only
shot well,’ said Coach Carl Peter-
son, “but he also passed well and
played good defense.”

Although the Cubs played well
in the earlier stages of the Johns-
town game, they fell apart some-
what toward the end.

Blew Layups

Their inability to score on sim-
ple layup shots in the last ﬁve
minutes of the contest made it

close, and almost cost them the-

victory. It the Panthers are to de-
feat Tech, they have to play more
consistent ‘ball throughout the
game.

Pitt’s squad will be strength-
ened for Saturday’s clash by the
addition of Marty Shottenheimer,
who played for Ft. Cherry’s
Class B State Championship
team. Shottenheimer joined the
squad late as he played on the
freshman football team.

The Panthers will be out to de-
feat the Tartans by the same
method which proved effective
against Johnstown. “The team
made a lot of mistakes against
Johnstown,” said Coach Peterson,
“but they made up for them by
hustling."

‘Oklahoma’ Goes Through Hai-«pl
Workouts For Wrestling Team

By BOB SMIZIK

Tim Gay, sweat oozing from
his pores, time and again cir-
cled the board track at the
Field House in preparation
for the start of wrestling
practice. While the Okla-

homa lad .teverishl.y worked out
a couple of his teammates play-
fully shot baskets. I

The would-be hoopsters ’were
not dogging it, they were merely
playing smart. Coach Rex Peery

championship at 157 pounds, Gay
amassed a ﬁne record while
wrestling for Will Rogers High
in Tulsa. ‘
Coach Peery makes no at-
tempt to hide his pleasure when
he sees the handsome Gay at
work. ‘‘There’s a boy that goes
all out. He seems to want to be
great,’ noted the mentor, with a
smile on his face.

Peery probably was thinking of
the two miles Gay runs, on his
own, every Saturday, in a further
effort to-better himself, when he
made the comment.

saving their energy.

Witﬁ Gay, whose middle name
could well be “desire,” any spare
time is converted into work. After
doing a mile on the track, he be-
came a janitor and set about the
task of sweeping off the wrestling
mat so thathe could begin prac-
ticing with fellow squad mem-
ber, John Zolikoff.

Captured Easterns

The great desire displayed by
Gay is ample proof that he is not
content to rest on his laurels,
which are plentiﬁul. In addition to
capturing the Eastern Freshman

Tim ﬁnds .a big difference in
Pennsylvania style wrestling. “Up
here most wrestlers rely on
strength to get the job done, but
back home about everyone tried
to out-slick his opponent. I have a
tendency to get on my back and it
is leaving me wide open for pins.”

Today in the wrestling room
Gay meets Augie Arrigone to de-
termine the squad’s number one
man in the 157 pound class. He
has already beaten Arrigone once
this year and if hard work has
anything to do with it, he will do
it again._

Two Yards Decid .: Title,

By ART FLEISCHNER
In a very unusual game, Deli
Tau Delta defeated Pi Kappa Al-
pha by “two yards” to win in:

football crown. To get to tin
ﬁnals, the Delts had to defeat
Lambda Chi in League B whil:;
the Pikas were winning over Phi.
Epsilon Pi in the A League.

If the decision of a win by “two
yards” has you stumped, there is
a rule which states that if the
game ends in a tie, a ﬁve minute
overtime is played. If there is no
score in the overtime, each team
gets four downs to move the ball
and the team that gains the most
yards wins.

The regulation time ended in a
6-6 tie as did the overtime. Ac-
cordingto IF rules, the Delts took
the ball on the fifty and in four
downs Inoved 16 yards. The Pikas
had the same opportunity but
cool go only 14 yards.

Bemis. Satisﬁed

Leo Bcmis, soccer coach and
head of the Intramural program
commented, “I was satisﬁed with
the Intramural football results.
All the Leagues were organized
and the boys expressed hope that
the same results might be attained
in other Intramural sports.”

Bemis continued, “We are go-
ing through clianges. There has
been a greater participation by
the students in the program this
year, especially the dorm stu-
dents. We have been working
to organize a good Dormitory
League and I think we are near-
ing our objective.”

There were four Leagues in op-
eration: the Dorm League, the En-
gineering League, the Independent
League, and the Fraternity League.
The Fraternities were awarded
two trophies per league, the win.-
ner and runner-up each receiving
one. In each of the two divisions
of the league there were seven
teams. -

Teams Picked

An All-Star team was chosen
for each league. In League A was
Mike Slutsky of Phi Epsilon Pi,
John Ciofﬁ of Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi
Lamb’s Bob Moses, Sigma Chi’s
Chuck Hughes, Leroy Henry of
Delta Sigma Chi and Rage Welsh
of Pi Kappa Alpha.

League B contributed Dick
Faull of Delta Tau Delta, Jack
Rohrman of Lambda Chi- Sigma
Epsilon Phi showed Bill Kutchle,
Theta Chi had Ron Prado, and
the Delts had Rich Learch as
their other member of the team.

Other sports that occupy the
winter sports schedule are soccer,

Cat Riflemen
Faring Badly

Pitt’s riﬂe team has found
the road a rough one so far
in its second year of competi-
tion since the sport was re-
activated last season. Never-
theless, the squad’s mentor,
Sargeant Benedict Bostwick of the
Military Science Department, still
feels that his charges have gained
much valuable experience and are
rapidly improving.

This campaign, the Panther
sharpshooters have dropped non-
league matches to Ohio State and
Penn State and have also lost to
W&J and West Virginia in two
Greater Pittsburgh Intercollegiate
League contests.

This Saturday Pitt ﬁres against
Duquesne at Carnegie Tech’s riﬂe
range, where the Tartans willalso
engage the ;B1utiites in a match.

Calmes Calm ‘Shooter

Team captain and senior leter-
man Joe Calmes has been pacing
the Cat gunners so far with an
average of 274 out of a possible
300. The Panthers have been av-
eraging l37O as a team for their
first four encounters.

The only other returning mon-
ogram winner is Alan Schweins-
berg. Junior Don Fucci, senior
John Skarga, and sop-h Mike
Tierney round out the top five
marksmen.

A promising freshman is Elea-
nor Schwartz of Mt. Lebanon, who
Sgt. Bostwick believes will be “a
definite asset” next season.

Ohio State University won the

,Wil1iam Pitt Debating Union’s

trust Legislation.

The ﬁrst-place trophy went to

second respectively among the
negative teams.

The Public Series Debates

students from six ‘local high
schols last Thursday and Friday.

Chuck Lebovitz and Larry Pro-

fant took the negative against the
University of Alabama on ‘Thurs-
day. On Friday, Kathy Flanagan
and Woody Higgins upheld the
aﬂirmative against the same Ala-
bama team.

Last Saturday the University
hosted the University of Vermont
and Ohio State University in the
Stephen Foster Memorial. The
teams debated the topic, Resolved:
That the. Several States Should
Lower the Legal Drinking Age to
18.

Awards were presented after-
wards to the winners of the

best speakers.

Although the Pitt C team came

because it was the host school,
they were allowed to accept
speaker medals. University win-
ners were Joseph Hallal and Alan
