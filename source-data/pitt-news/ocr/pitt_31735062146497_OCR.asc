PLAN ENDED MAY1---REPORT
  our soon--sLocAN‘ FOB 

8 NEXT YEAR IS “DOUBLE  
YOUR GIFT”    

 <
The first year of the Alumni Giving Plan is“ now over‘-; .May ‘I being the)
date when the accounts were closed. There are a few-unpaid ‘accounts out,
and the Secretary has sent lstatemcntsho-to these alumni. If same are to be
included In the first ycar’s report, they must be. paid immediately. -
Roughly, the receipts for the first year amounted to about $25,000. repre-
senting thc gifts of some 3,200 subscribers, or an average -of about.$8 Pen

 

~ords preparatory to issuing. the first annual report. This report will be com-
plete in every way, giving. a list of the givers, according to classes and per-
centage of givers for each class. The total cash reccivcclfrom each class
will also bcshown, although there will be no individual subscriptions re-
ported. There are approxl_mateIy‘10,500 alumni, graduates; and otherwise,
living, and they will all receive copies of thcannual report.

The Alumni Ofﬁcc is also organizing for the next ﬁscal year, and in the
very near future class agents. will receive full -instructions regarding this.
The slogan for the second year will be: .“DOUBLE YOUR SUBSCRIP-

the second year. This should -be possible in most cases, as the average sub»
scription did not go into large ﬁgures, many of the alumni ‘paying the min»
imum of $3, $4 or $5. A half dozen or more of the large subscriptions were
received, one amounting to $600. ' ’ ‘ ‘
HELPED ALUMNI HALL

than that necessary for alumni activities was turned over to the Alumni Hall
Fund, these payments tiding the Finance Committee of Alumni Hall over
many emergencies. The funds were applied towards. reducing the notes.
paying interest, etc. The ‘total indebtedness, as often reported in The
Weekly, amounts in the neighborhood"of $300,000. ‘ _ I
I, $50,000‘ or more can be raised the second ﬁscal year ‘of the GIVING
PLA a big hole can be made in this indebtedness. — , .
Those back of the ALUMNI GIVING PLAN are very well satisﬁed with
the f :;.,ycar’s results, Twenty ﬁve thousand dollars is not a big amount,
but   mpares very well with Yale's first year, when they raised_only
$11,000 from about 300 subscribers. ‘ V
Yale's fund now runs as high as $500,000 a year, showing how a plan for
systematic giving started with small ﬁgures ‘can be developed. IT IS LIKE
AN ACORN, EVENTUALLY GROWING INTO A MIGHTY OAK.

FRVESHMANNINDE  
  BEATS umon, 12-5

The Pitt Freshman baseball club,
going into action for the second time
in the present season, set down Unlon_
High. School of Turtle Creek, 12 to 5,
with an entirely different line-up than
that seen in the disastrous Schenley
game. vs Last,week’s tilt was played on
the losers’ ﬁeld. - .

The Frosh started the game in an
encouraging; way -by driving in sev-
en markers in the opening frame.
Three more in the fourth and two
in the fifth ended the" scoring for
the seven innings. Botti,_ former
Union ' High man who pitched the
Schenley game for "the ‘Cubs, worked
out on the ,mound. He passed two
and "fanned five of his‘ former mates,
but he gave no more than a single
in the seves bits which he scattered
through the game. On the otherv
hand, seventeen Pittites whiffed be-
foretwo opposing liurlers, bruvtdthey
collected 14 hits, among which were
numbered three triples and two
doubles. ‘

For the Frosh, Archibald, a Dental
student, showed to thegreatest ad-
vantage with the willow. In his
five times at bat, four of which were
legal, the middle ﬁelder smacked out ‘
three singles and a triple. He‘
proved‘ his base-running ability by
tallying three of the 12 runs.
