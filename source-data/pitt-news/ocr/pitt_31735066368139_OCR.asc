team competition. Pitt defeated
teams from Penn State, George
Washington and West Virginia,
among others, to gain the final
round.

In coming months the Wil-

Hopes Fade
as Irish
Beat Pitt

By scorr DELLETT

It will be remembered by
Panther fans as the two plays that
kept Pitt ‘from a chance for a
national championship. A

Joe Howard's 54-yard touch-
down reception off a flea-flicker
and ‘Allen Pickett’s 76-yard touch-
down dash were the catalyst to
Notre Dame’s 31-16 win before
60,162 spectators and several bowl
scouts at Pitt Stadium Saturday
afternoon.

The loss not only knocks the
Panthers out of the No. 1 spot, but
it put them out of the running to
receive a major bowl bid.

With Pitt holding on to a 13-10
lead early in the fourth quarter,
Irish quarterback Blair Kiel
handed off to tailback Phil Carter,
who took a few steps right and
pitched the football back to Kiel.
Kiel threw for Howard, who beat
the Panther secondary by five
yards. Mike Johnston’s extra point
gave Notre Dame a 17-13 lead.

Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust
said the play was a new wrinkle
added for the game.

“Tom Lichtenberg, our offen-
sive coordinator, put in the flea-
flicker this week,” he said. “It
wasn't based on anything we saw
in Pitt’s defense; it was something
we thought would work.”

“The key was that Pitt wasn’t
blitzing,” Kiel said. “Carter did a
fantastic job faking the run then
tossing back the ball.”

But the Panthers recovered from
the trick play to cut the lead down
to one point. Key passes from Pitt

Koppel: Jewry Shouldstrengthen Identity

By MARK A SINGLER

The biggest challenge facing
American jewry today is to streng-
then its own identity and not
become hostile to the non-Jewish
community, Ted Koppel, anchor-

Aman for ABC’s Nightline series,

said last night.

Koppel was the keynote speaker
for the Zionist Organization of
America’s annual fund-raising
dinner at the Downtown Hilton.

Most of Koppel’s address dealt
with the» world’s reactions to
Israel’s invasion of Southern
Lebanon in June and the media’s
handling of that states policies
and actions since then.

Koppel-stressed the key differen-

ces between truth and fact in news’

coverage. He presented an example
distinguishing the two facets and
their applicability in journalism,
broadcast or print.

“Suppose the president of the
United States holds a press confer-
ence and says that Ted Koppel is an
alcoholic,” he said. “Now, the
media has every right to repeat that
charge. They can report the remark
as a fact, but it is not true."

He added that this constitutes
news because of who said it.

For Koppel, a lot of his reporting
of the world’s events occurs on the
Nightline evening slot. He con-

ducts many live interviews for the
program and said he tries to be as
informed as possible about the sub-
ject to be discussed.

“Ninety-five out of a hundred of
my interviews are unedited,” he
said. “We try not to prejudice our
views, but it is our conviction that
the closest to the truth- is reached
when all parties concerned are
involved.”

Some of his programs tend to be
one-sided, Koppel said, adding
that he often encounters guests
who refuse to appear for any inter-
view, edited or live, for one reason
or another.

This occured when Koppel
wanted to field both the Israeli
ambassadors to the United States
and United Nations and two Pales-
tinian representatives. The Israelis
failed to comply.

“Neither the executive producer
nor I will permit anyone to set the
guidelines for our reporting of
events. People have the right to
decline interviews, but not to set
the terms of the agreement.”

A lot of what ends up on the air,
Koppel said, depends on camera
time, satellites and time of day. He
cited the particular instance in
which Britain’s Prime Minister
Margaret Thatchei and P3.rllf'..'.".f.m
members were awakened at three
and four in the morning for live

interviews during the Falklands
war.
Others are not
accommodating. _
Koppell also pointed out the dif-
ficulty getting news through

ABC’s East Beirut satellite base,
which was under Christian
control. * ‘

Koppel said that Israel continu-
ally states its primary goal to be

12th Annual Jazz ; -
Seminar a Success

By WALTER R. WATSON

To call the 12th Annual Pitt Jazz
Seminar/Concert a success would
be to understate the case.

“I’ve been involved with the jazz
seminars here since the begin-
ning,” said Dr. Donald Henderson,
Pitt vice-provost and master of
ceremonies for Saturday’s musical
program.

This year’s musicians performed
an evening ofjazz, which, from the
response at Carnegie Music Hall,
will not be equalled or surpassed
for a long time to come.

The concert, publicized as “an
evening of international jazz," fea-
tured saxophonist Grover
Washington, Jr., Japanese trumpe-
ter'1‘erunias; 312?; drummer/Wix
Acuna of Peru, Czechoslovakian-

born bassist Miroslav Vitous, guit-
arist Ted Dunbar and ethnomusic-
ologist Dr. Nathan Davis of Pitt,
founder of the jazz seminar series.
The event was sponsored by the
Pitt Program Council.

The concert, which sold out
Monday of last week, was divided
into two parts. The musicians
would play and be featured in com-
positions of their own choosing
and in various combinations sug-
gested by Davis or Grover
Washington, Jr.

After a 15-minute intermission,
an announcement was made that
two new names had been added to
the International Academy of Jazz
Hall of Fame. The academy, estab-
lished at Pitt in 1977, recognizes
artists, both living_and dead, who

have made exceptional contribu-
tion to the jazz art form.

The induction of trumpeter Roy
Eldridge and saxophonist Lester
‘Prez’ Young was armounfied
before the annual special award
was presented to Grover Washing-
ton, Jr. _

The special award, given in
recognition of outstanding contri-
butions to growth and develop-
ment in the field of jazz was
presented to vice-chancellor for
student affairs, Dr. Conney Kimbo.

Washington, in his acceptance
speech, gave credit to several musi-
cians before him who have inspired
his playing throughout his career.
Besides Rasaan Roland Kirk, Eric

Dolphy, John Coltrane and Sonny
Rollins, Washington cited Davis as
being at the top of the list of artists
who have helped him work in the
jazz idiom. -

“I accept this award with them
(the saxophonists aforementi-
oned),” Washington said.

Washington, currently working
on a doctorate in musical composi-
tion at Temple University, said of
the preparation in putting together
the material for the concert, the
situation was very much like a “tra-
ditional jazz group, where every-
thing more or less is spontaneous.
The audience did a lot to bring the
music and everything really closer
together and make it an event
instead of just a gig.”

“They will do what is necessary
to survive, but so will the United
States. In fact, it is the goal of every
country to survive by any means
available.”

“(Prime Minister Menachem)

Sharon repeatedly say there won’t
be a repeat of Vietnam or Nicara-
gua. However, Israeli action con-
tinues to jeopardize American

“Israel,” Koppel continued, “is
no longer perceived as being
vulnerable, but is now a formida-
ble military power—a bully. Its
government’s insensitivity is
defiant to the United States.”

Koppel, a native of Great Bri-
tain, has been with ABC for 20
years and is in his third year with
Nightline, which began with the
Iranian hostage-taking of Ameri-
cans in 1979. Before assuming
anchorman duties, he has been an
‘overseas correspondent and a

LNNHHEUEDHVMWIHNG
FEA TURES FOR THE

By VICTORIAPOWELL

A Pitt student has adopted a (lif-
ferent form of philosopher Rene
Descartes’ famous adage in his

. attempt to start 21 humor magazine

at Pitt.

Ira Nathenson explains his
attempt by saying, “I laugh; there-
fore, I am." He said he also wants
to “unite people in laughter”
through the writings in the
magazine.

Nathenson, who is a junior
majoring in writing, first bounced
the idea off some of his writing
teachers who gave him a vote of
confidence both as a writer and a
producer of a magazine.

   
  
 
 
 
 
  
 

Join the Sera-Tec Christmas Cliibtt

Chris Rawson, a Pitt English
teacher, referred Nathenson to

Larry Lunsford, the adviser of the
student media groups.

In order to receive school money
to publish the magazine, Nathen-
son must meet certain require-
ments set forth by the Media and
Publications Board, the group that
allocates funds for media groups.

According to the board, Nathen-
son and his future staff must write a
chapter of bylaws, set a target date
for publication and produce some
tangible material that would be
included in the first issue.

Nathenson came to Pitt after
spending his freshman year at the
University of Michigan. That
school, he said, did not fit into his

of Michigan did have 21 humor
magazine, Nathenson said it was
not very good, l)ut at least there was
one. _

The first meeting of all students
interested in Nathenson’s attempt
will be held in 501 Cathedral of
Learniiig on Nov. l7 at 4 p.in.

Some people have already shown
an interest -in working for the inag—
azine, but Nathenson said there is
still a great need for writers, photo-
graphers, artists and business
managers. ,

“Everything is up in the air,” he
said. “This is a new venture, and
ideas are welcome.”

Profile: Rev. Carl Temp/in, PRISM Mastermind
5

By GUAN KEGUANG

Directly across the street from
the Pitt Book Center stands the
Bellefield Presbyterian Chttrch.
This church does not look as
itnposing as most of the other
churches in the area, but it
draws more international stu-
dent, non-Christians included,

‘$1., than any other church in Pitts-

burgh.

This is because of PRISM
(Pittsburgh Region Interna-
tional Student Ministries) and
its tnastermind-—Rev. Carl
Templin.

In the past two and a half
years, nearly 300 students from
over 50 cottntries have come
here regularly to take part in
various activities sponsored l)y
PRISM.

With its limited budget,
PRISM cannot afford to adver-
tise. Besides, its has no need for
advertisement; word of the
retnarkable work it has been
doing is constantly on the lips
of many international students,
who recommend it to their
friends.

PRISM is a non—profil,
church—affiliated organi/.ation;
Iemplin is its head and only
regular staff member. There are
two part—titne workers who
come in once a week. Naturally,
Templin has a very heavy work
load. However, the 45-year old
minister is so committed to his
work that he enjoys what he is
doing immensely, in spite of the
fact that very often he has to
work day and night.

Since he started PRISM in
February 1980, he has managed
to organize many fee or low-cost
activities for international stu-
dents in Pittsburgh.

When asked how he l)ecatne
involved in the work, he said
that there was a long story to
tell.

When he was a teen-ager, he
was not the least inclined to
religion. “Ministers," he
thought,“are very strange peo-
ple." Like many other Ameri-
can kids, he was enthusiastic
al)out sports and dreamed of
becotning a star someday. His
hero was Donn Moomaw, All-
American lineman'for UCLA.
()ne day in I955, when Tem-
plin was 18 years old, Moomaw
came to give a talk in a local

church. He went thinking he
might learn how to train to l)e a
good athlete. But instead, Moo-
maw talked about how to
become a good Christian and
the importance of making a
personal corntnittment to Jesus
Christ. It set Templin to think-
ing seriottsly about the mean-
ing of life.

After high school, he went to
CMU and decided to become a
chemical engineer, because he
thought he would be able to
make good money. Now that he
became a good Christian his
mind turned from material
gains to spiritual achievements.
He cut short his chemical engi-
neering studies at CMU and
began to study physical educa-
lion at Pitt.

He was returning to sports
with a new orientation.

“It was my desire to be a»
coach and to work with high
school students,” lemplin
said. He thought that as a coach
he would find it easier to
approach students anti bring
the biblical message to them.
He ‘recalled that when he was in
high school he had lived an
aimless life, and hoped to
awaken young people sooner.

In 19:38, between his sopho-
more andjunior years at Pitt, he
had a new experience which
further broadened his outlook
in life and motivated hint to
take an interest in internationl
studies.

“In 1958, I had the opportun-

ity to go to Ethiopia for one year _

to live with an American mis-
sionary family who were work-
ing there. I taught in the school
that was being operated by
them at that time,” Templin
recalled. “I returned to Pitts-
burgh in June 1959 and pretty
tnuch decided that if it was pos-
sible for me to return to Ethio-
pia to do educational work, I
would do that.”

Templiti graduated from Pitt
in 1961. In 1964, he took his
family with him anti returned
to Ethiopia to work as educa-
tion director under the United
Presbyterian Church in the
western part of Ethiopia. In
1975, hedecided to move back to
America.

He had been back to Pitts-
burgh for one year in 1970. He
took that opportunity to start a
Ph.D. program at Pitt in inter-
national development educa-
tion.

THE

He explained his interest in
that field by saying, “I'm just
sort of trying to weave together
or to evaluate the different alter-
natives available for us to select,
seeking which alternative
would offer the greatest benefits
to the people of the world."

After he returned too Pitts-
burgh in 1975, he was hired to
do educational work with the
Presbyterian Church in the
Pittsburgh area. At the satne
time he passed the National
Ordination examinations and
was ordained a Presbyterian
pastor, one of the few in the
U.S. who didn’t go to the semi-
nary to train for the ministry.
He had the financial support
from the tnore than 30 Presbyte-
rian churches in the Pittsburgh
area. He has been paid by them
on the mission salary scale for
his work with PRISM.

“I hope to be able to do this
work for the rest of my career,”
said Templin. “I’m 45 years
old, so I hope at least I’ll have 20
more working years...When
you get this international stuff
in your blood, it’s like getting
malaria, you know. You won’t
ever get rid of it. You just carry
it around with you."

Department

Rate

Two University of Pitts-
burgh graduate departments-
philosophy and the history and
philosophy of science (HPS)—
have been ranked among the
top five philosophy programs
in the nation in a study con-
ducted by the National
Academy of Sciences.

The National Research
Council of the Academy sur-
veyed university faculty nation-
wide in each of nine disciplines
in the humanities and asked
them to rank other -schools in
their disciplines. According to
sources at the National
Academy, Pitt’s programs in
philosophy and history and
philosophy of science ranked in
the top five nationally in both
scholarly quality of faculty in
the program and in effective-
ness of program in educating

research scholars.

In the category of scholarly
quality of faculty, on a scale of O
to 5, Pitt’s philosophy faculty
ranked 4.6. Only two schools-
Princeton and Harvard-
ranked higher, both at 4.7. On a
mean scale of 50 Pitt’s philo-
sophy faculty ranked 71.

In the category of effective-
ness in educating scholars, on a
scale of 0 to 3, Pitt’s philosophy
department came in at 2.6, and
on the mean of 50 ranked 72.
Pitt was second behind Prin-
ceton at 2.7.

The department of history
and philosophy of science,
competing in the same cate-
gory, was judged fifth in the
nation. The department ranked
4.4 out of 5 in quality of faculty
and 68 compared to a mean of
50.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar
commented, “It is noteworthy
that Pittsburgh is the only
instutution with two distinct
programs ranked in the philo-
sophy category. This indicates
that their combined strength is
even greater than their inde-
pendent rankings. It is very
gratifying to be so highly
regarded by a jury of peers in
this discipline. We anticipate
that this ranking will help us to
continue to attract top quality
graduate ‘students and sustain
the excellence of the programs.

“Not revealed in this result is
that within our whole philo-
sophy faculty, we have the most
powerful group in the field of
philosophy of science in the
world. Also significant is that
Pitt was one of just a few uni-
versities with two ,or more
departments ranked as being in
the top five.”

Oakland Gets  New

as

Breed Of Bag Ladies

By COLLETTE FERRIS

There's a new group of bag
ladies in Oakland.

They don't wear heavy coats
and sleep on park benches.
Instead, they're more likely to
be seen carrying shopping bags
full of schoolbooks around.

The Academic Bag Ladies is a
support group for women 25 or
older who feel out of place in
the academic world. They meet
weekly to discuss problems
older women face in returning
to school, according to Beverly
Aurand and Maggie Flackett,
who founded the group earlier
this year.

At their meetings, they dis-

cuss problems with classes and
learn about financial aid, tutor-
ing and child care services.
“The ladies are able to vent
their frustrations and have

someone with similar difficul-
ties to listen to,” Aurand said.

The bag ladies meet at the
Lutheran Campus Ministry
twice on Saturdays 4from noon
until 1 p.m. and from 4 until 6
p.m.—to accommodate every-
one’s busy schedule, Aurand
said.

The bag ladies got their name
from a Pitt doctoral student and
group member who noted the
bags they carry around all day
for their books and meals,
Aurand said.

The group’s first meeting
drew eight women, but Aurand
is hoping to increase its size.

“It is a good program which
can develop into a major com-
munication network between
Pitt’s and CMU’s older female
students and the university and
its functions,” she said.

The Door
ls Open-

If President Reagan is seeking reelection,
as his aides suggest, he desperately needs
more than just a_ political victory—he needs
a change in his attitudes.

The Democrats have picked up 26 seats in
Congress, and it is unlikely that Reagan’s
future economic programs will ever be
implemented. Reagan needs to take lessons
from previous presidents: When in trouble,
travel.

It is clear from the election returns that
the American populace is concerned about
nuclear weapons. Massachusetts, Michi-
gan, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota,
Oregon, California and’Rhode Island all
passed nuclear freeze resolutions during the
recent elections. Similar resolutions were
also passed by 275 city governments, 12 state
legislatures and 446 New England town
meetings. Reagan can not continue to
ignore the tensions thatexist between the
Soviet Union and the United States.

Obviously, the START talks are not
enough.

If Cold Warrior Richard Nixon could
meet Brezhnev in Moscow, then Reagan can
do the same. His visit would show a will-

_ ingness to listen to the growing publicgcall

for a nuclear freeze.
Brezhnevls speech to the military last
week showed a change in Soviet rhetoric

toward the U.S. It did not signal a return to

the “We will bury the West” days. Cher-
nenko, a likely successor to Brezhnev, wants
the West to know that if it should choose to
pursue the option of detente, the door is not
closed.

If Reagan has any serious intentions of
being reelected, he must listen to his new
mandate.

Reagan is capable of restoring detente. A
visit-to Moscow needs, however, to provide
more than just lip service. Serious negotia-
tions must take place.

Nixon used such a trip to his benefit.
Reagan, by making sincere overtures to
Moscow, could draw attention away from
his faltering economic program, which has
isolated him. He must deal with an issue
that has international repercussions and
strong support at home.

Drop The Pretensions

By MARY KANE

Anyone trying to figure out vot-
ing trends at Pitt will probably find
the task more confusing than vot-
ing was.-That is saying a lot, con-
sidering Pitt voters faced a field of
25 candidates with few discernible
differences from which to choose
their Student Government Board.

All 25 candidates were against
the student aid cuts (is anyone ever
for them?), they wanted greater
involvement in student govern-
ment and more communication
between the board and its commit-
tees. They were all for more careful
monitoring of the board’s liaisons,
and above all, these were interest-
ing and active people who really
wanted to work hard for the inter-
ests of Pitt students—their past
involvement in other student
groups proves this—and,...Well,
you get the idea.

There were actually candidates
who probably would have made
effective board members. Consider

Connie Kreischer. She heads the .

Student Government Board com-
mittee that lobbies the state legisla-
ture for increased appropriations
for Pitt, which is no small feat. Not
only did Kreischer lose, she didn’t
even come close, finishing 19th in

the 23-candidate field.

Since it appears students weren’t
likely to vote for a candidate on the
basis of his experience, what
exactly were they looking for? Bril-
liant orators? Analytic minds?
Good dressers? Judging from the
results, they were looking for their
fraternity brothers and sorority sis-
ters. There is only one non—greek
on the nine-member board.

There’s nothing wrong with
that—at least the Greeks vote,
which is more than can be said for
the majority of students here. What
it does point out is the futility of
pretending, year after year, that
this somehow is a “real” election
and we should treat it that way.

We interview the candidates,
hold endorsement hearings, vote
and then become frustrated and
angry when we find out that some
of the candidates who we thought

 

bordered on illiteracy were the top
vote—getters.

I still remember a Pitt News
staffer throwing a cropping wheel
in disgust on the deadline night
when last year’s returns came in.
James Shelton, an Allocations
Committee member and probably
the most intelligent and well-
qualified candidate, finished some-
where near the bottom of the field.

VVe can only blame ourselves for
taking all this so seriously, but we
can attempt to reform. Several can-

For next year’s elections, we
should drop all the pretensions.
We should hold endorsement hear-
ings only to encourage the candi-
dates to tell us why they’re really
running. It would be refreshing to
hear someone come out and say it:
“I’m running for Student Govern-
ment Board because I’m cute, I’m
popular, I have lots of friends and
this way I’ll get more and I want to
be noticed at parties. Plus, it looks
great on my resume.”

~. The idea isn't that far-fetched. At
our endorsement hearings
year, when asked why she was run-
ning for the board, one candidate
replied: “Someone was asking me
that at a party last night and I
said....” She won, too.

I’d advise potential candidates to
skip hearings, interviews and all
that campaign bureaucracy. Look
around you and imitate the things’

effective is lining up about 25 of

ple you know who wear identical

And

By PEGGY FERRI

Some say that I am becoming too
cynical and serious for my age, and
maybe that's true, I)ut it's not with-

._out good reason. I really used to

believe all the ads that said une-
quivocably, “A mind is a terible
thing to waste," and was certain
that the rest of society felt the
same—-not so.

Mitids aren't being wasted, but a
lot of potential is going to waste
because there isn't a market for it.
Like my friend Barb says,  who
hires you to think, anyway?"

I’m sure we all had friends in
high school that we thought really
had their head on straight. They
weren't going to let anything get in
their way‘. Yes, they were going to
make careers for themselves, but
they didii’t count on the money not
being there and the market for crea-
tive individuals (like us liberal arts
majors) decreasing in proportion
to the need for more “cogs in the
machine.”

Bill was going to go into
governinent-related work, Carol
was going to be a pianist and Jan

was going to write children's sto—'

ries. A couple of oiice-budding

‘artists and actresses now confide

that they feel they sold out and are

living a life they'd rather not.
Worse yet, some got inarried—

more out of economic necessity

than out of love. '

The other night, in a long
overdue call to a friend, I discov-
ered that she was envious of my life.
Why? Because she said that “I was
doing something with it." I hung

 

up feeling very uncomfortable.

I can hear the arguments now.
They sound something like “But,
if they were really serious they
would have..." or “No one is sup-
posed to hand out free-rides. When
I was your age I had to work....”
Sl"lT(‘,-ll]Cy sound like good argu-
ments, but they don’t say anything.

So, who said life is fair, right?

Wrong. When I think of all the
computer science major look-
alikes who could be the innovative

Who Loses More ?

thinkers and creators for the next
generation, I have to wonder who
loses inore—the individual or
society as a whole? The next gener-

. atioii is going to be seriously defi-

cient of thinkers, inventors and
artists.

Part of the blame can lie pinned
on the ecoiioiny——part of the blame
can always be pinned on the econ-
omy. But, even during the Great
Depression, our government had
the foresight to pay creative people
to design and build things that
were long overdue and essential to
the identity of this country.

Unfortunately, interested parties
must see no percentage in that for
them or else I wouldn't be writing
this column.

The individual? Well, there are
going to be a lot of them out there
wringing their hands and wonder-
ing why intellectual curiosity isn't
a marketable skill. And my - old
friends will continue to rationalize
their life's work as the‘only alterna-
tive to starving or waiting a long
time.

‘The. liberal arts majors like me
still sticking to it will become less
c.ertainand more cynical everytime
another potential talent bites the
dust.

Even Fame Has ltsPrice

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Perhaps, as someone once said,
it's the price one must pay for fame.
If that’s true, I think I prefer to
remain in obscurity for the rest of
my life.

_I.P. and Ainiii came home over
the weekend for the Pitt—Notre
Dame game; we had planned a
mini-Pitt News reunion for the two
recent graduates. For memory’s
sake, we attended a few of the Oak-
land bars and rehashed old times.

I had expected to have agood
time with my friends; what I hadn't
expected was to be hassled by some
of my college peers because of my
column on rock and roll and my
political views in regards to the
Student Government Board.

I was sitting in Danny's havinga
few beers with my friends when
about 10 guys walked right up to
our table and immediately began to
hassle and heckle my friends and
myself.

Not to name names, but a certain
recently-elected board member
(whom The Pitt News vehemently
opposed in a recent editorial) and
his fraternity brothers taunted us
because he won the election.

I’m a firm believer in the rights
of freedom of speech and assembly,
but I draw the line when‘ my pri-
vacy is invaded by immature, sore

Dear Editor:

Question: Why aren't Pitt
students able to get tickets to the
Penn State game?

Looking forward to this
year's game at State College, I
was disappointed and upset at
the unavailability of tickets. I
have attended past games at Pitt
Stadium, so I know the Univer-
sity iiiust have received 5,000 to
I0,000 tickets (since there are at
least that many State fans at the

winners. But don’t fret, folks, I told
them off—to the delight of my
fr-iends.

If that wasn’t bad enough, a guy
from the same group yelled at me
and said I had an obligation to
explain my position on sexism and

‘I had expected to get
trashed in the opinion
pages of the paper, but
that’s as far as it should

go.’

rock and roll. First of all, buddy, I
don’t have an obligation to you or
anyone else. Second,even if I did, I
don’t think Danny's Pub is the
place to explain my opinions. If
you want. to talk, come to The Pitt
News office, and maybe, just
maybe, I'll talk to you.

The whole point is if some peo-
ple can't leave petty differences and
opposite views out of bars, they
should have their LCBS revoked

‘because they're not acting like

responsible adults.

I had expected to get trashed in
the opinion pages of the paper, but
that's as far as it should go. When a
person cannot go out with her
friends on a Friday night without

’ being called names and liassled,

then the world is in a sorry state.

Who Has All The Tickets?

game). When tickets went on
sale Nov. 3, the Student Union
had a grand total of 350 tickets
available to students—only I50
if you didn't want to take the
bus.

Who has all the tickets? The
Golden Panthers? Why should
they get all the tickets? Sure the
university needs contributions
and must cater to this need, but
give the students a break! We
deserve a chance to see the game
even if we can't afford $1,000 to

Sure it's fun to have some noto-
riety, but come on, I’m not Patti
Burns or Barbara Walters; I’m just
a college journalist trying to pave
my way for a future career.

As I said earlier, I guess it's just
the price one intist pay for fame.
The thing that surprises me is that
not many people know what I look
like, yet at Danny's that same
night, some guycaine up to me and
asked, “You're Chris Clinton,
aren't you?" Dummy me, I told the
truth. He then proceeded to intro-
duce me to my. No. I fan, Peter
Bonacuse. At least Boiiacuse had
the decency not to insult me; in
fact, he was actually quite nice.
Thanks.

Maybe I'll adopt a pen name for
the nights I go out to the Oakland
bars or parties. "Or maybe I'll just
stick to the bars in my home town.

The point I'm trying to make is
this: a person, no matter how con-
troversial she is, should be allowed
to live a normal life during her free
time; she shouldn't be expected to
explain her position to every drunk
she meets.

It seems as ifl learn a lesson every
(lay. The next time I see someone a
little famous or just well-knowii,
I'm going to stare, btit I won't open
my month except to say hello.

give to the team.

Come on Pitt, pry some
tickets away from the Golden
Panthers and give the students a
fair chance to go to the game.
Remember Pitt, present stu-
dents equal future alumni—
don’t alienate us.

David T reece
CAS, '83

Dear Editor:

I would like to clarify some of
E.G. Heart's erroneous state-
ments in his column entitled
“Degrading Our Quarterback,”
which was printed on Friday,
Nov. 5, I982.

As far as The Pitt News is
concerned:

Pitt quarterback Dan Marino.
We have reported when he has
played poorly——it’s hard to
ignore 18 interceptions. We
have no obligation to paint a
rosy picture of Marino as you
seem to indicate, solely because
this is The Pitt News. Marino is
not “our" quarterback—he’s
Pitt's quarterback. It's difficult
. to picture him tossing passes to
the staff writers in the less than
spacious Pitt News office.

0 Besides, it would be pretty
boring if every article were
“Rah, rah, Pitt.” We would lose
our status as a newspaper and
move into the Sports Informa-
tion Department. Dean Billick
might savor the idea of some
extra publicity, but our readers
wouldn't. Should we pass out
Dan Marino buttons next?

0 We have never printed
“Dan Marino Is Washed Up”
stories. Twenty-one-year-old

0 We have never “idegraded”' ’

Remove Blinders

quarterbacks- don't wash up;
that’s generally reserved for 35-
year-olds.

0 Sure, all of the blame
should not be bestowed on
Marino. As you §ay, his receiv-
ers do run the wrong patterns
and drop the perfect passes. And
yes, the coaches do call bad
plays. But Dan Marino is the
person who has thrown 18
interceptions, not his receivers
or Coaches.

0 We do have the right to cri-

. ticize Pitt's football program,

even though we have “never
been down on the field." As far
as I know, the First Amendment
has not been repealed.

0 No, I don’t “prefer Todd
B1ackledge," as you imply. If
you remove your blinders,
you’ll see that I have often
referred to Marino as “the best
quarterback in college foot-
baIl—that includes Stanford's
John Elway.

Now for the true statements
in your article:

0 Dan Marino doesn’t need
“some bumbling underclass—
man to defend him." You hit
the nail dead center on that one.

Former US. Senator Eugene
McCarthy and former White
House Counsel to Richard
Nixon John Ehrlichman
recently debated ethics in Amer-
ican government and con-
cluded that ethics were
questionable today although
their explanations differed. The
following are excerpts from an
article, as it appeared, in the
UWM Post, the newspaper of
the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee. The article was
written by staff member Kevin
Liner.

“Corporations, even though
they are legally private persons,
lack human consciousness and
scruples,” ,McCarthy said.
“Also corporations are respon-
sible for putting many elected
government officials into office
today. We should not be sur-
prised when these officials take
on the behavior of this corpo
rate spirit.” V

Referring to the ‘Senate,
which McCarthy was a member
for 12 years, Ehrlichman said it
“was a club, entrenched in its
own self-serving interests.” He
cited the Senate Ethics Commit-
tee for being especially reluc-
tant to police the activities of
senators. He also berated the
practice of negotiating with
outside interests for ' private
gain, claiming ex-president
Lyndon Johnson became a mil-
lionaire while senator through
questionable means.

McCarthy also found some
fault in the Senate, though not
of an ethical nature.

"The Senate has signed over
too much of its designated con-

stitutional powers," McCarthy
said. He said this has been done
in three major areas: allowing
the president inordinate power
in foreign policy formulation,
giving the president the upper
hand in appointing Supreme
Court justices, and allowing
governing bureaucracies to reg-
ulate beyond their rightful stat-
utory and constitutional limits.

McCarthy took the oppor-
tunity to criticize recent presi-
dents in the use and abuse of

- their powers.

“Truman was the first presi-
dent to have a sense of how pres-
idential powers
used,” McCarthy said. He said
that all presidents since Tru-
man had fallen prey to the
“temptation of the will," which

he described as the gradual

move toward extending execu-
tive powers to previously
unused realms.

Ehrlichman defended the
recent personalization of the
presidency, claiming that it is a
natural product of the nature of
the electoral politics.

“The presidency becomes
that which the personality of
the man we elect causes it to
become,” Ehrlichman said.

In his only direct reference to
his former superior, Ehrlich-
man said that Nixon was a man
occasionally given to flashes of
belief in his own infallibility,
and would issue extravagant
“Alice-In-Wonderland state-
ments along the lines of ‘off
with his head.’ ” When this
occurred, Ehrlichman said that
he and other aides would fail to
carry out the orders and would
wait for Nixon to calm down.

Notre Dame Knocks Pitt From Top , 31-16

continued from page one

ning back Bryan Thomas and Joe
McCall brought the ball to the
Irish 37. However, two runs by
Thomas netted only six yards and a
pass from Marino to split end

Julius Dawkins was broken up by‘

Notre Dame cornerback Chris
Brown in the end zone. Eric Schu-
bert came on and hit a 47-yard field
goal, reducing the Irish lead to 17-
16. ‘

After Pitt held on the Irish’s next
series, it appeared that the Panthers
were ready to score again. Thomas’
two runs gained 17 yards and a rush
by McCall got the ball to the Notre
Dame 33.0n the next yard, Marino
found Dawkins on the 22. The
senior wide receiver spun around
to get a couple of extra yards, but
the ball popped loose and corner-
back John Mosley recovered on the
Irish 24.

After an incomplete pass, Pickett
took a handoff on a draw, cut back
inside—avoiding the grasp of sev-
eral Panthers—and outraced the
Pitt secondary.

“The play was designed so that
the tailback had two options,”
Pickett said. “I could look for the
cutback or wait to run outside. I
saw a little funnel and I tried to get
through as quickly as possible.”

The loss of Flynn had an effect
on the Pitt secondary, but Fazio
refused to put the blame on his
replacement, Rick Dukovich.

“I thought Rick played a great

Saturday.

game until the flea-flicker,” he
said. “I don’t know if Tommy
would have tackled some of the
guys who broke into the open.”
Schubert’s foot was busy because
the Pitt offense was unable to drive
in for touchdowns, although they
moved the ball with regularity. In
Pitt’s first possession, passes by
Marino to Barry Compton for 19
yards and to Dawkins for 20 put the
ball on the Notre Dame 29. How-
ever, the drive stalled as Thomas
lost one yard, Marino fumbled the
snap and lost two and a pass
intended for Dawkins in the end
zone was overthrown. Schubert

came in and booted a 48-yarder, the

longest in his collegiate career, giv-

ing the Panthers a 3-0 lead.
Flanker Dwight Collins played a

 

vital role in the next Panther pos-

session. After a Thomas run for
two yards, Collins caught three
consective passes for 14, 14 and
eight yards, bringing the ball to the
Irish 22.

The Panthers were able to take
the ball to the four; the key» was
Marino’s connection to tight end
Clint Wilson, gaining 12 yards.
But a loss by Thomas and two
Marino incompletions stopped the
march, and Schubert was called
upon to kick a 22-yard field goal.

Panther mistakes helped Notre
Dame score its first 10 points. Pun-
ter Greg Ganzer booted a short
punt deep into his own end. Joe
Johnson made the fair catch at the
Pitt 36, and reserve running back
Darrell Stone tackled him. The

personal foul penalty took the ball
to the Panther 21. Notre Dame was
unable to move the ball, and
Johnston kicked a 38-yard field
goal, his 16th in 17 tries this season.

After stopping the Irish in their
own zone, the Pitt defense left the
field——only to return moments
later. Kiel pijﬁtéd the Ball £5 jéff
Casper. who was filling in for
Flynn as a punt returner. He
fumbled the kick and Notre Dame’s
Rick Naylor recovered the ball on
the Panther 45.

Kiel immediately hit fullback
Larry Moriarty down the middle
for 30 yards to the Pitt 15, and Pick-
ett gained 11 more over theleft end.
Moriarty finished the drive with a
touchdown from four yards out.

Irish
Have
All The
Luck

By BARRY ZASLOFF

With a little luck we can see it
through, we can make this whole
damn thing work out.-From a
Paul McCartney song, adopted last
Saturday by Notre Dame coach
Gerry Faust.

Tradition. History. The luck of
the Irish. Pitt challenged it all last
Saturday and lost, as Notre Dame
shattered the Panthers’ chances of a
national championship, 31-16.

What seven other opponents
couldn’t do, the Irish did—hand
Pitt its firsttloss this year.

Perhaps kissing the Blarney
Stone results in more than the gift
of gab. If so, Notre Dame must have
made a pilgrimage to County
Cork, Ireland last Friday evening.

Where was Pitt? Perhaps kissing
a waitress at the Blarney Stone res-
taurant in Etna.

If anything, the statistics indi-
cate that the final score should have

Roan v-n..o.mn,-‘I.
- r 1 nr l‘_'._-. ,!n-....... I>r\

O Pitt gained 25 first downs t
just 10 for Notre Dame.

0 The Panthers nearly doubled
the Irish in offensive plays—88 to
48.

O Pitt passed for 3l4»yards while
Notre Dame threw for 126.

o The Panthers possessed the
ball for 37:29, compared to the
Irish’s 22:31. 7

“We moved the ball well,” said
Pitt coach Foge Fazio afterward.
“We just couldn’t get the ball into
the end zone. They played great
defense, and we fumbled the ball
away on our drives—-—which
shouldn’t happen. They were
costly mistakes.”

More than anything, it was a ser-
ies of big plays that paved the way
for Notre Dame’s upset of No. 1
ranked Pitt. There was a Blair Kiel-
to—Phil Carter-to-Kiel-to-Joe How-
ard 54-yard touchdown pass that
put the Irish ahead l7-13 in the
fourth quarter. There was a 30-yard
pass play that set up the Irish’s first
touchdown and a 29-yard run by
Larry Moriarty that put Notre
Dame in position for its final score.

The big plays evidenced the
absence of free safety and punt
returner Tom Flynn.who had left
the game early in the second quar-
ter with a sprained foot. His
replacements were Rick Dukovich
on defense and Jeff Casper on punt
returns.

_ “Rick played a great game until
the flea-flicker,” Fazio insisted. “I
don’t know if Tommy would have
tackled some of the guys who broke
into the open.” »

The flea-flicker. The trickery
that broke Pitt's momentum. The
play that has Pitt’s hopes of a
national championship flickering
out.

“Our offensive coordinator put
in the flea-flicker just this week,”
said Notre Dame coach Gerry
Faust. “It wasn't based on any-
thing we saw in Pitt’s defense—it
was something we thought would
work.

“We wanted to try it one other
time earlier in the game,” Faust

Pitt Not The Only Top 10 Team To Fall Q

By scorr DELLETT

Depending on which poll you go
by, either Southern Methodist or
Georgia will be the new No. 1 team
when the polls come out on
Tuesday.

SMU, the No. 2 team in the Asso-
ciated press college poll and No. 3
in United Press International, eas-
ily disposed of Rice 41-14. Tailback
Craig James, the lesser known half
of the Mustangs’ Pony Express, ran
for 130 yards and threw a touch-
down pass. Eric Dickerson, gained
102 yards and scored his 14th
touchdown of the year on a 19-yard
run in the fourth quarter.

The gaine was scoreless in the
first quarter, but the Mustangs
‘quickly scored 27 points before the
half. '

Georgia, probably aware of the
upset of‘ Pitt by Notre Dame, rolled
over Florida 44-0. Herschel Walker
rushed for 219 yards and three
touchdowns and in the process
moved into fifth place on the
NCAA career rushing list. Kevin

. Butler also kicked three field goals

for the Bulldogs.

Arizona State had some prob-
lems with the winless Oregon
State, but they managed a 30-16 vic-
tory. Luis Zendejas kicked three
field goals, including a school
record of 55 yards. The Beavers
only trailed at halftime 17-16. The
Sun Devils are 9-0 on the season,
5-0 in conference play.

Arkansas’ chances to win the
Southwestern Conference title
went up in smoke as Baylor upset
the Razorbacks 24-17. Arkansas

' took a 14-0 lead on a 24-yard pass

from quarterback Brad Taylor to
Gary Anderson and a one yard run
by Jessie Clark. -

But the Bears fought back to tie
the game at 17-all, and Alfred And-

erson ran four yards for a touch-
down with 2:38 remaining to spark
the upset.

Nebraska had an easy time with
Oklahoma State, 48-10. Junior tail-
back Mike Rozier set a single sea-
son record‘ with 1,379 yards this
season. He also scored four
touchdowns

The Husker defense held Ernest
Anderson, the nation’s leading
rusher to 68 yards.

Penn State annihilated North
Carolina State 54-0 as the Nittany
Lions helped their chances for a
major bowl bid. Curt Warner
scored two touchdowns and rushed
for 106 yards, tying Lydell Mit-
che11’s mark of 15-100 yard games.
Kenny Jackson caught seven passes
for 122 yards in his best day at Penn
State. J

The defense forced seven turnov-
ers, including an interception
return by Scott Radecic for a touch-
down, his second this season. Penn
State will travel to South Bend to
face Notre Dame this weekend.

Led by quarterback Alan Risher,
who threw for 182 yards and a
touchdown and a wall-like defense,
Louisiana State upset Alabama at
Birmingham. 20-10.

LSU scored on a 4-yard pass for
Risher to Malcolm Scott, a 16-yard
run by Dalton Hilliard and two
field goals by Juan Betanzos.

The Tigers held Alabama to no
first downs during the first half.
Alabama scored on a 28-yard pass
from Walter Lewis to Joey Jones
and a Peter Kim 31-yard field goal.

Washington recovered from its
upset last week to Stanford by
defeating UCLA 10-7. Jacque
Robinson ran four yards for a
touchdown and Chuck Nelson
kicked an 18-yard field goal, his
27th consective field goal.

The only Bruin score came in the
fourth quarter as quarterback Tom
Ramsey hit Jeff. Townsell with a
39-yard pass.

Tl1e Panther gymnastic tea111
111ade its debut last Friday against
so111e of the stiffest competition iii
the co11111ry. They traveled to ()l1io
State University and participated
i11 tl1e rek11ow11ed Buckeye Open.

Although they fi11ished llth,
tl1ey turned iii a score of 252.09 — a
yery respectable score for this early
111 the season.

Coach Frank I)'Amico com-
n1e111ed o11 tl1el1igl1-caliber compe-
tition against which tl1e Panthers
we11t tl1is weekend. “It was a 111001
with 111any 11atio11ally-ra11ked
teams. Some of the teams were
twice the size of ours."

D'Amico did not expect his tea111
to win tl1e 111eet; some of the other

teams’ coaches did. All he was hop- ,

i11g to do was to get the team's 11ew—

est 111e1nbers primed for collegiate

co111petitio11.

“Tl1e freshmen did extr0111ely
well," I)’A1nico said.

He was pleased with all four of
tlie freshmen’s performances and
efforts. ()11e fresl1111a11 he was
exceedingly happy with was Kevin
Garren of Reading, Pa. Garren’s
vault i11 the preliminary competi-
tio11 was clean enough to qualify
him for the fi11als on Saturday.

Another Panther freshman who
sparkled was Mark Klafter. Klafter,
who was last year’s New York High
School State Champion in the all-
around, has experience in co111pet—
i11g against elite gy11111asts. This
experience aided Klafter, especially
(111 the parallel bars, where he
earned a score of 8.65. Klafter's
small, stocky fra111e enabled him to
outclass other co111petitors o11 the
rings with :1 routine of difficult
stre11gtl1 111oves.

Dave Lucas, who did 11ot see
111ucl1 actio11 last year, proved that
he is indeed worthy of Division I
co111petitio11 by scori11g a 8.75 (111
the floor exercise.

Matt Peters was another fresl1-

man who did 11ot allow the pres--—

sure of facing high—caliber
competition to affect his perfor-
mance. Peter's solid floor exercise
and high bar routines were exe-
cuted i11 the 111a1111er of a seasoned
veteran rather than a fresl1111a11.
Junior Dave S111itl1 competed iii
the all—around for the first time
since his high school days at Butler
High. S1i1itl1 made the tra11sitio11
from specialist to all—aro11nd this
summer after l)'Amico noticed his

all—aro1111d potential. His scoreof

Side horse specialist Mike Lloyd

score in this event. Lloyd (lid this i11

Another fine side horse perfor-

The vaulting finals featured
another Panther gymnast, junior
Frank Krat/., who is known for his
energy i11 ju111ping off the vaulti11g

a score of 9.5.

None of the Panthers who co111—

he did in the preliminaries. How-

told the story. Pitt's: somber, with»

quiet thoughts of how it happened

Dame's: jubilant, with loud

“Some of our players are really
down,” Fazio said. “They felt that
they lost it—that they didn't get
beat.”

“Our kids played their hearts
out,” Faust said. “We’ve had to
overcome some adversity the last

best wins, especially since we had

dition. In fact. Faust gave his pre-
game speech from a sheet entitled
“Big Carries,” which listed no
fewer than seven times when the
Irish upset top-rated or undefeated
teams. I

The list continues to grow,
though initially it appeared that
Pitt would burn it to ashes. At the
outset, the Panthers had little diffi-
culty penetrating the Irish defense.
Pitt settled for two first quarter
field goals. From there, things
steadily worsened.

“We came out, moved the ball
well and scored,” said flanker
Dwight Collins. “Then we made
some mistakes, and the bottom fell
out.” _

“We had our chances,” Fazio
said. “We made it nip and tuck.”

Which was just right for the
Irish.

Panthers

Fall To 

Notre
Dame

_]ohnston’s kick made the score 10-
6, where it stayed until halftime.

“We, didn’t punt the ball well
when we had to,” Fazio said, “we
didn’t catch the punt and we kept
the defense on the field.”

According to Moriarty, he and
Kiel discussed the play that led to
the 30-yard gain the night before
the game.

“I told Blair last night (Friday)
when he threw the pass, he didn’t
have to lead me,” he said, “I said,
‘Don't throw it perfect, but just get
it out there.’ ”

“It couldn’t been thrown any
better. I get excited when plays like
that work.”

The best execution by the Panth-
ers came on an 18-play, 98-yard
touchdown drive after a Kiel put
down a punt at the Pitt two. Key
plays were passes from Marino to
McCall for eight, Marino to C01-
lins for 11, a Thomas run for 13 and
a Marino-to—Dawkins toss for 14 as
Pitt moved to the Notre Dame 30.

However, it appeared that the
Panthers were stalling when Tho-
mas lost two yards and Marino
threw an incompletion. But
Marino found split end Keith Wil-
liams along the right sidelines at
the Irish 17, keeping the drive alive.

Five straight runs by Thomas
got the ball into the endzone, cli-
maxing a drive that lasted 8:42.
Schubert’s extra point gave Pitt a
13-10 lead.

To demonstrate the control the
Panthers had in the second and
third quarters, Pitt had the ball for
21:30, while Notre Dame held the
ball for only 8:30. Yet, Pitt only had
a three point lead. There was no
doubt Notre Dame dominated the
fourth quarter.

With a 24-16 lead, the Irish took
the ball over on their 35. A reverse
by Howard got the ball inside
Panther territory. After a short run
by Pickett, Moriarty took a hand
off inside and rumbled 29 yards to
the Pitt 15. Two plays later, Pickett
spun in from eight yards for the
final margin.

Faust complimented the whole
Irish squad, a team that has
received much criticism.

“Our kids played their hearts out
today,” Faust said. “We’ve had to
overcome some adversity the last
few weeks, and this is a great vic-
tory. We thought we had great
game plans both offensively and
defensely.”

.Although Faust said it was hard
to pick out a single player who’did
an outstanding job, he did praise
quarterback Kiel, who has also
been a target for criticism.

“Kiel played excellent football,”
Faust said. “He found himselfdur-
ing the Oregon game and now he is
a heck of a quarterback. People
have been criticizing him this year,
but someone ought to start singing
his praises. He deserves some
credit.”

“Notre Dame has a tradition of
being underdog and upsetting No.
1 teams,” Pickett said. “Coach
Faust mentioned it in the pep talk,
but we were ready anyway.”

Kiel said, “This was the biggest
game of my career and one of the
greatest Notre Dame wins in
history."

A game Notre Dame A will
remember. ()ne Pitt would like to
forget.
