DENVER——Victory in the (Appeals Court last month marked the fourth time in a V
row that Mine-Mill has been vindicated against Taft-Hartley affidavit attacks and
cleared of “communism” charges by the higher courts.

The U. S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals March 5 reversed the conviction of nine
present and past Mine-Mill leaders on charges of conspiracy to defraud the government

by violating the Taft-Hartley act. It ruled they had been improperly tried and icon-"

victed. .

Keynote of Confidence Sounded
In Officers’ Report to Convention

TORONTO, Ont. — Events of
the past year once ‘again demon-

I strate Mine-Mill’s ability to win

the solid gains “that have put
our members among the best
paid industrial workers in North
America,” President John Clark
told the delegates in the annual
officers’ report prepared for de-

livery to, the 57th Convention

here.

Speaking in behalf of the In-
ternational Executive B o a r d,
Clark sounded a keynote of con-
fidence based on “the impres-
sive record of achievement that
has been built by our union over

"the past year” in all phases of

activity. These, he said, included
major achievements in bargain-
ing, legislative gains, political
campaigns and. defense of the"
union against attack. _
In a look ahead, his report

projected a recommended pro-
gram to further consolidate the
stability and strength of Mine-
Mill as the dominant union in
the non-ferrous metals industry.
>!‘- it ill I

ADDRESSING himself to the
past year’s events, Clark hailed
the outstanding success of the
union’s initiative in pioneering

recent negotiations free of gov-

ernment pressure. or interven-
tion.

As a result, he pointed out,
Mine-Mill was able to establish

a breakthrough in 1962 bargain- -

ing with its own pattern of early

' settlements with major produc-

ers effective well in advance of
contract expiration dates.
These agreements, all provid-
ing solid gains in‘ hard cash
packages worth from 23.7 cents
to 26 cents per hour over two

years, were c on c lu d e d with
Phelps Dodge and Magma Cop-

per in January, and with Ameri- «

can Smelting & Refining just
this past month. -

More than 30 other new settle-
ments or wage agreements on
re-openers were made in the
year since the last convention,
Clark reported.

|i¢>l4’l¢

REVIEWING successes of the
union’s legislative and political
action program on the national
level and in particular states,
Clark cited enactment of the
mine safety bill (Metal and Non-
metallic Mines Study Act of
1961) during the last session of
Congress as “Mine-Mil1’s major
achievement on the legislative

front in the past. year.” .
Urging the fullest cooperation

-A-AAAAAAAAAA--AA

of mining area local unions with
the Bureau of Mines, which has
responsibility u n d e r the act,

Clark said its investigation and
reporting of the facts should
“point strongly to the need for
permanent federal mine safety
legislation” which the union will

Tl-IE MINE-MILL UNION‘

 

More Contract Gains N’ego'l-ial-led

While major settlements with the big industry pro-
ducers of copper, lead and zinc have been making the
headlines, Mine-Mill locals in other sections of the in-
dustry have also been signing new contracts of similar
value and just as important to their own memberships.

Here are two more, re-
ported to the Mine-Mill Un-
ion last month:

Cleveland. Ohio

A new agreement whose pack-
age value is estimated in excess
of 30 cents an hour was signed
in Cleveland March 10 between

..Local 735 and Mor-Flo In-

dustries, Inc. The plant is a
unit of the Mine-Mill Cleveland
Amalgamated local which or-
ganized it in 1960 when it was
known as Mor-Flo Heater Com-
pany. The company several
months ago moved to a new lo-
cation and plant outside the
city.

Effective immediately on sign-
ing for the first year are wage
increases of 5 to 30 cents an
hour, shift differentials of 9_and
13 cents for the second and
third shifts, and the establish-
ment of job classifications for
the first time. Effective now
are jury pay and three days
with pay-death in the immediate
family allowance.

Contract provisions for the
second year call for a general
wage increase of 7 cents per
hour; plus increased life insur-
ance and health and accident
benefits. Full cost of the in-
creased benefits as well as that
part of the premium formerly
paid by the employees, plus
$3.36 not previously paid by the
company, will now be paid by
the company on the Blue Cross-

~ Blue Shield coverage.

The increased insurance bene-
fits plus the company’s picking
up the cost of the premium are
worth 5.2 cents alone. The un-
ion, in addition, won ‘a revised
incentive plan which will also
be reflected in substantially in-
creased earnings.

Making up the bargaining
committee were: Unit Shop
Chairman L. C. Bolin, Albert
Sandidge, Kenneth Allen and
Luther Aaron. They were as-
sisted by District‘ 3 Board Mem-
ber Raymond Dennis.

Saginaw, Ala.

Unanimous acceptance of a
new contract with Long-View
Lime Corporation was voted by
the membership of Blue Eagle
Local 81 at Saginaw, Ala., last
month.

Provisions of the agreement,
running until March 1, 1965, in-
clude:

Effective as of March 1, 1962

—wage increase of 7 cents an:

hour across the board and one
additional “pay-dollar day”
(Good Friday) bringing pay-dol-
lar days to five, plus $1 per

’ month company contribution to

the employees hospitalization

and medical insurance benefit

(this means an additional dollar
take-home pay to workers as it
reduces the employee’s con-
tribution by this amount);

Effective Mareh 1, 1963—-an-
other general wage increase of
6 cents an hour, and one more
pay-dollar day (New Year’s
Day) bringing pay-dollar days
to six, plus an additional $1 re-
duction on employee insurance
contribution which means a dol-
lar more in take-home pay for
each worker."

Prior to March 1, 1964, either
party may reopen the contract
on wages and other economic
benefits.

An amendment to the con-
tract was also negotiated clari-
fying the time limit on _tem-
porary vacancies before jobs
shall be posted.

District 5 Board Member M.
C. Anderson assisted the Local
81 negotiating committee which

consisted of President L. A. I

Brantly, Vice—President Jim
Pickett, P. A. Posey, Monroe
Dowdell, W. E. Ross; J. R. Wil-
son, Walter Dowdell and Robert
Haynes. ‘

The old contract was origin-
ally scheduled to run until

Buffe Miners Display

Opposition to Disrupfers

BUTTE, Mont.—Butte miners picketed a meeting
called by outside Steel raiders here March 13 which
drew only five actual workers from the “Hill.” Mine-Mill
Local 1 officers said the Steel meeting “was attended by
salaried organizers of the Steelworkers and by piecard

or imported personnel
brought to Butte to create
dissension among the miners
here.”

Butte Miners Union Presi-
dent Reginald Beavis, Record-
ing Secretary Maurice Powers
and Financial Secretary John
Glase said members of Local 1
would continue to picket any
other meeting called by the raid-
ers in Butte. —

“The Butte Miners Union
feels it is its right to protest
publicly the attempted raid by
the Steelworkers on the oldest
established nonferrous m i n e
workers’ union in‘ the West,”
they declared. “We will have
banners printed to display our
opposition to the Steelworkers.
The" banners will be used in

picketing of every meeting the
Steelworkers or any other raid-
ing organization calls.”

MINE-MILL Districtl Board
Member Barney Rask, former
president. of the Butte ‘Miners
Union before elected to Inter-
national Union office, joined
the Local 1 leaders in stating
that members of the local “will
create no disturbances or inci-
dents.” '

“But,” he -added, “the Butte
miners feel it is their right to
register opposition against
those who would destroy labor
peace in this community.”

It was the second time in as
many weeks that Steel raid
meetings have been picketed.

were begun under a wage re-
opener on economic issues this
past March 1 when the mutual-
ly agreed extension for a better
package settlement was worked
out by the union and the com-
pany. .

THE MINE-MILL UNION

  

PHOENIX, Ariz.—Lobby work by a joint group of 14 Mine-Mill Ladies Auxiliary
gates from four locals added momentum late in February to activities being car-

_éd',,on by the Arizona Mine-Mill Council at the state capitol here behind its program

  

  

g the Arizona locals.

  

   

Several Ladies Auxiliary dele-
(_ s"who participated in the
Ph é'nix lobby have written

_ r _impressions of the state
éapitolv‘ visit. "Here are some
brief "quotes from their reports:

COLLEAN' DERRICK (Pres.,
..a,n.iManuel Aux. 937): “One of
the, things we accomplished was
toiniake the men who represent
1’,'_1,,s_.,in’the state capitol realize
_ that wehave every intention of
 standing up for what we believe
 . . . The women are becom-
ing more educated to the goals
of the Labor Unions and their
aim to p r 0 t e ct the working

man." '

L2-MARY HORNER and JOSE-_
PHINE MOLINA (937): “We
ink. we should certainly have
the mills, smelters and crush-
grs inspected where there is as
much danger of occupational
disease as in the mines, perhaps
even more so. . . . We were
told‘ that this would be worked
out. in a satisfactory way to all.
We hope it is.” «

NORA SANCHEZ (Fin. Sec.,

once they realized the purpose .

of our intention, most Senators
were concerned with our pres-
ence. ,. . . I was specially im-
pressed with the formality used
in introducing bills and the dis-
cussion held on same.”

LOUISE WHITAKER (Pub-
licity Director, Bisbee Aux.
551): “We were very happy
with the results obtained from
our discussions. . . . Afterwards,
the women got together and ex-
pressed their desire to form a
state-wide auxiliary organiza-
tion so that more ladies will
join and be more informed on
their working men’s conditions.
We intend to make more visits
to the Capitol in the future.”

DELORES RUIZ (551): “Our
purpose and interest in mine

Altogether, in their rounds of
visits, theyymet and discussed
the union’s program with about
thirty key members of both state
houses, including the President
of the Senate,- and the Speaker
of the House.

They concentrated especially
onsessions with chairmen and
vice - chairmen of committees

‘ considering the specific legisla-
tion which the union has initiated,

and is pushing for passage in

this session of the legislature.
Among these were measures

to: extend the jurisdiction of the

State Mine Inspector to mills, .

smelters and other surface
operations as well to a provide
for the appropriation of funds
f o r additional personnel to
carry out safety inspections;
improve coverage and benefits
under the State Occupational
Diseases and Disability Act;
and revision of the State Mining
Code along with the union’s pro-
posal for the setting up of a

DELIA FELIX (Rec. Sec.,

is everybody’s business and
this is why I feel that our trip

to the legislature proved to be
interesting, enlightening and ed-
ucational. . . . I believe that
our political voice should be
felt’ with more force. . . . We,
the Mine-Mill women, have just
as much a stake in this matter
as do our men who go down
into the mines. . . . We know
what to do and we plan to take
the initiative.”

ROSE GARCIA (929): “The
lobbying to me was most re-
warding. . . . These bills are
very important to our working
men in the mines. . . . After
viewing the legislature in ses-

a much clearer view of how our
laws are made and how impor-

Mine-Mill Dumps
TwoMore Raiders

Raid attempts on Mine-Mill local units at Chicago
Foundry Company in Chicago and Stauffer Chemical
Company in San Francisco were resoundingly smashed
by 2 to 1 votes in NLRB elections at both properties last

month.

Chicago

A raid by the Molders Union
on the Chicago Foundry unit of

Local 758 was defeated by the .

vote of 42 to 21 in the election
held March 2. Preparations for
new contract negotiations, held
up by the raid, were immediate-

’ ly resumed.

‘ It was the second time in two
years that a Molders raid has
been defeated at this plant,
which’ has been part ofvLocal
758 for 19 years. Each time the
raiders moved in at contract
time to get cards signed with
the aid of a little loot and prom-
ising the moon if they win.
The Mo1ders- are the same

outfit from which Mine-Mill took

back the Magnus Metals plant
in an NLRB election last year.
Magnus plant chairman War-
ren Johnson and shop secretary
Arthur Lee assisted in defeating
the recent raid, along with
Foundry shop chairman Wil-
liam Garrett, secretary -James
Harris, committeeman Nathan
Sharpe and many other mem-
bers at the plant.

District 3 Board Member Ray-
mond Dennis and Int’l Rep-.
J ames‘ Pinta“ also helped in the

v campaign.

San Francisco

Members of the Local 50 unit
at Stauffer Chemical knocked
off a raid by Operating Engi-
neers Local 39 by the vote of 30
to 16 in an NLRB consent elec-
tion March 8.

The victory ended about three
weeks of high pressure sales pro-
motion by the raiders, includ-
ing promises of wage increases,

hiring hall privileges for laid- .

off employees, guaranteed week-
ly strike benefits, steak dinners,
and a leaflet and telephone bar-
rage.

The decisive vote result
showed the conviction of Stanf-
fer workers that the Operating
Engineers could not even come
close to matching the democ-
racy enjoyed by Local 50 mem-
bers in the operation of their
union and the service they re-
ceive. ’More than‘ one member
said “our contract is one of the
best for an industrial plant on
the West Coast-—why change?”

A main item in the victory
was the fine teamwork of stew-
ards and members. Next comes
negotiations for a new contract
with the company.

, THE ':MlN'E-MILL UNI‘oN" '

« President's Corner:

dC1ark Pays Tribute

To Canadian Union

FTER nearly seventy years as an International Union
our convention is being held for the first time In
Canada, in the city of Toronto, Ontario. This marks an

. historic event for our union.

During the late nineties of the last century, the West-

Columbia which proved to be fertile‘ ground for
organizing. In a short time what is known as
the Boundary country and the East and West
Kootenais, which at that time was the center
of mining and smelting activities, became a
part of the W. F. of M. and undoubtedly was
the primary beginning of the Canadian labor
movement.

Canada became part of District 6 of the Fed-
eration which extended into Alaska and later
.. into the Porcupine District in Ontario. ‘

. The early-day leaders of the Canadian locals

Clark were a party to and builders of this union
during its most trying days. They were part of the fight throughout
the Rocky Mountain area down to the Mexican border—-—active in
the leadership of the fight to free the top officers Moyer, Haywood
and Pettibone who were facing a frame-up murder charge in the
court in Boise, Idaho.

    

iﬁk 

HEY were a part of the initial foundations of Mine-Mill in all

its early struggles, and I am sure this convention will hail them
and dedicate the occasion in their honor.

Following their great tradition as union men devoted to the
cause of Mine-Mill on every front, our Canadian brothers have
continued their support, morally and financially, down through the
years in all the later fights where attempts have been made to
persecute and destroy the International Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter workers which grew out of the old Western Federation
of Miners.

Only in a few cases has a cordon of weak and disruptive local
leaders shown face, such as in Sudbury and Port Colborne, and

these -have been caused by outside. anti-union elements and payoffs

—mostly instigated by the raiding and corruptive Steel union
leadership.
‘A’ ‘A’ *

AM SURE that our Canadian brothers, who declared and main-

tained support of some of the present International officers
during the last spasms of persecution, are happy over the late
developments which brought reversal of the convictions of the
Mine-Mill leaders in the Taft-Hartley “conspiracy” case.

The vindication of this union represented by the Appeals Court
reversal. should ..shame those presumed leaders and piecards of
Steel who have been using their lying divisive propaganda against
Mine-Mill—declining to give credence to .the fact that the higher
courts do have the last say on the guilt or innocence of those
accused citizens who render theirappeal to them. i

I am convinced more than ever that our membership from now
on particularly will recognize_ it for’ what it is worth when these
self-appointed judges of men’s guilt grind out their distorted propa-
ganda and character assassination against real trade unionists and
the one organization that had the guts and the ability to organize
the" vicious anti-labor corporations of the non-ferrous metals indus-
try and gain the wages and conditions that our membership enjoys

today.
at * *

HE RECENT decision of the U. S. Court in Denver upholds the

declaration of this union that there is unjust legal harassment
against Mine-Mill, aided and abetted by the Steel union.

The decision increases our confidence that the courts, when
they examine the distortions and hearsay evidence against your
union in the SACB case, will in the final analysis do as they have
done in the past four cases—place it where it belongs back in the
garbage can of the informer clique. '

A formal statement of what I think of this reversal is printed
on page 12 of this issue of the paper, but I want to say again that
the complete dismissal of the case against Brother Chase Powers
and former Int’l Rep. James Durkin is a full. vindication of our
position that the evidence against them and also against the others
would not stand up when taken to the higher courts.

*‘k*

HE PAST few weeks has again shown our membership how

untrustworthy is the propaganda of the Steel leadership, par-
ticularly coming from the piecards in the field among whom are
some who deserted this union for their own selfish reasons.

When SACB hearing officer Cherry handed down his recom-
mended decision against this union, these raiding leaders crowed
to high heaven that Mine-Mill would not be able to bargain on
contracts. The true facts of life have exposed them as liars. The
SACB report in no way stops the power of our union in the bargain-
ing field.

The Mine-Mill settlements, reached after that report came out,
cover Phelps Dodge, Magma Copper and American Smelting &
Refining in the big production field, and numerous ones in the allied
industries. These contract settlements, as well as several NLRB
representation elections recently won by our union, are ample
proof of the job we can do. .

These major settlements do_ not have to be blown up as do the
Steel settlements in their propaganda. Our settlements are there
in hard cash and benefits easilyunderstood by our membership.
More of these settlements are on the way.—JOIIN CLARK.

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

BINGHAM CANYON, Utah-
More than $1,450 was raised
here in a benefit drive spon-
sored by Bingham Open Pit
Miners Union Local 485 to as-
sist one of its members, now a
paraplegic v i c t i m. Chairman
Carlyle Carter of the Mine-Mill
local’s fund-raising committee
described the campaign as “a
gigantic success.”

The money was used to pur-
chase a specially-built paraple-

gic’s bed for Chris Herrera and

assist his family. Herrera has
been paralyzed from the waist

down since May of 1956, when -

he was severely injured in an
automobile accident.
Electrically operated, the bed
will enable Herrera to place
himself in practically any posi-
tion by merely pressing buttons.
He has been bed-ridden since
the accident. '

ACCORDING to Carter, the
funds were raised through a
rafﬂe campaign which the Ken-
necott local started shortly after
January 1st.

The drive ended on Feb. 19
atthe local’s regular member-
shipzsmeeting when Father
Mark Bevegnu, Catholic priest
of St. Francis’ Parish in Kearns,
Utah, drew the three lucky

, tickets.

Rafflesprizes were a portable
television set, a clock radio and
a transistor radio.

CARTER reported more than "

$1,450 was collected through the
ticket raffle. He said that ex-
penses, including. cost of the
raffle tickets and prizes, were
$275. This left $1,192 clear,
which was given to the Herrera
family for the purchase of the
bed and other assistance. The
bed itself, called a “Striker
bed,” costs $987.

Highlight of the campaign
was the fine cooperation be-

IN the field of Unemployment

Compensation, he recalled that

the union supported both tem-
porary extension of existing job-
less benefits and enactment of
basic uniform federal unemploy-
ment insurance standards.
“Only the temporary exten-
sion of benefits passed,” he ob-
served,‘ warning at the same
time that “this temporary ex-
tension is rapidly running out.”
On another measure proposed
by the Kennedy Administration,
for granting of tax credits. to
business to spur modernization
and expansion of plant and
equipment, Clark repeated ,the
union’s opposition, voiced last
year in a statement before the

A House Ways and Means Commit-

tee. He said the measure, which

failed to pass but which is being‘

pushed again by the Administra-
tion this year, “would mean

further displacement of.workers _

at’ a time when there is no

' meaningful and adequate public

policy to cope with the problem

.of serious unemploymen .”

TURNING to Mine-Mill action
on the state level, Clark’s report
declared that “the past year has
seen more political and legisla-

tive activity by local unions, and

state-wide bodies, and more
solid -and substantial results,
than in any previous year.” .

, He chiefly noted two important
off-ye ar political elections in
Arizona and New Jersey ‘where
Mine-Mill’s area influence fig-
ured decisively. These were: the
election of Arizona’s Morris K.
Udall to fill the seat left vacant

by the appointment of former.

Democratic Congressman, Stew-
art Udall, his brother, as Secre-

tary of Interior; and the surprise _

upset victory of .Democrat'_Rich-
ard J. Hughes  the race for
governor of New Jersey. '

Both Udall and his Republican
opponent acknowledged publicly
that it was Mine-Mill . support
which provided Udall’s 2,000
vote margin of victory. Mine-
Mill’s New Jersey membership,
traditionally , h e a v i l y Demo-
cratic, was an important factor
in Hughes’ victory by the mar-
gin of 20,000 out of a total of

morelthan 2,000,000 votes cast. ,

In northern New Jersey, where

Ass’t Secretary of Labor James
Reynolds told a labor-m_anage-
ment conference here Feb‘. 21.

He said this aspect of unemploy-

ment is generally overlooked.
Joblessness among employable
persons under 21 rose in Jan-
uary even though total unem-
ployment dropped, Reynolds
said. These young people now
are a substantial part of the

,‘ country’s estimated 4.7 million- ‘

unemployed. Nearly half of the

unemployed youths have been‘

jobless for 15 months or more.
. Reynolds emphasized the im-
portance of students completing

high school before seeking a‘

full-time job. Automation and

stepped-up competition from "
abroad have eliminated many,

low-skilled jobs, the said.

A CLARK also pointed to activ-
ity paying off with results in the

field of "state mine safety in ~
Arizona, Montana and New Mex-

ico; in the field of education
with establishment of junior col-
leges in Arizona, a movement
initiated by Bisbee and Douglas

field of labor unity on ‘legislation
in Washington, Montana and
other states. ‘ '

Under the ‘basic activity of _.

the winning of bargaining rights
at the Inspiration Consolidated

in -Arizona, the rejoining with
Mine-Mill of the Chicago Magnus
Metals (National Lead) plant
after an absence of"six years,
and the organization of a new
Stauffer Chemical Co In p a n y

Along with organizing, he "also

pointed to the decisive defeat -

of ‘raiding efforts by the Steel-

workers and otherunions at the

Plume & Atwood plant in Con-'
necticut, the Nevada operations
of Kennecott Copper in Nevada,
plants of Revere Copper & Brass
and Stauffer Chemical in Cal-

Foundry Company in Illinois.

The Steelworkers never got off

. the ground in their attempts to

tNew Mexico and Utah, he said.

ON another front of union de-
fense against attack, Clark’s re-
port hailed the recent reversal
of the Taft-Hartley conspiracy
case against Mine-Mill as “still
another vindication of the union
and its leadership.”.- .

He noted that the decision .0

the 10th Circuit Appeals Court in

’ Denver was the. fourth time in"

a‘ row that the higher courts
have upheld Mine-Mill‘ against

developments, "the impact of

specific effects in the non-fer-

During. the past’ year alone,
Clark said, automation develop-

hundreds of jobs in Mine-Mill

‘ operations. “Over the years it

adds up to a loss of thousands of
jobs,” he added, emphasizing
that “the sheer size of the prob-

‘lem of‘ providing jobs for all in

3 oals to Assure Financial g 
Sfablhfy Proposed for Union  
V TORONTO, Ont.—_§Three key goals to assure the financial stability of the    

ternational Union and provide adequate service for the needs ‘of the membership ‘

were placed before the 57th convention delegates here in the section of "the an- 
nual officers’ report prepared“ for delivery by Secretary-Treasurer, Irving Dichter. ‘

First, Dichter said, the Int
V action of the convention to

provide for an increase in
the union’s’ General Fund in-
come.‘ ‘ ‘ -
' This additional income is -re-
quired, he said, “to increase
our organizational activity‘, im-
prove the servicing of our local
unions, expand our educational
services, expand our legislative
work in Washington. and the
state capitals, and defend the
Union against those employer
forces who seek to weaken .it..”
The second‘ goal is the build-
ing up of a sizeable strike fund.
“A-healthy strike fund is-the

' best possible form of strike in-

surance we can have,” the re-

: port said.

C BUILDING up of a half-mi1-

-lion-dollar contingency reserve

in_ the union’s General Fund, was
the third "goal -raised by the

Secretary-Treasu'rer’s report. It -_
. s.aid:- “The need for a reserve

speaks for itself.‘With a healthy

reserve we ‘are in a.position to _
meet all co'ntingencie_s which

may arise in the future.” ,

 

Proposed once more to put the -

union on -a , sounder financial
footing was the per capita rec-
ommendation which was ap-

, proved by last year’s ‘convention

but which failed to pass in ref-
erendum. This ,is . to increase

COMMENTS -ON REPORTS

EXHIBIT “A”--Statement of Comparative Condition. Comment on balances fol-
lowing refer to December 31, 1961.

Cash in General Fund Accounts: Amounts were confirmed directly with the
depositaries concerned. The decrease in such funds for the year was primarily
due to the loans advancedto the International Strike Fund, $20,000.00; and to
Canada $40,000.00. These advances are reflected in the following accounts: Accounts
Receivab1e—Strike ‘Fund, and Accounts ‘Receivable--‘Other.

Receivables and Advances: As noted above, Accounts Receivable have increased
due to advances to the International Strike Fund and Canada, as well as to several
Locals. Periodic payments are being received to reduce these debts on a syste-
matic basis. 1

Balances of Notes ‘Receivable total $4,006.15, less Uncollected Notes Receivable
in the same amount. As back per capita and fees as evidenced by these Notes are
received, the preceding accounts are reduced in equal amounts.

Advances to Employees and Others: «Current items are in the processpxof repay-‘L

ment through payroll and expense voucher deductions. Non-current-amounts are
being followed up for payment, or will be -disposed of- by Executive Board action.

COMMENTS (Continued)

Contra to the Treasury Bond asset account is Discount on Purchases, reflecting

9‘ the difference between face value and cost. The market value of the bonds at

,5,‘-.,._ -balance sheet date was approximately equal to this cost figure. No adjust-
if . ments are contemplated to reflect such market value.

A cash investment in ten shares of common stock of the Portland Reporter

‘ Publishing Company were made in this period for the par value of $100.00. .

" » Furniture and Equipment: Net of Depreciation Reserve, this account has been

I carried forward unchanged for the past several years.

Bonds. This payment was made subsequent to the balance sheet date, when the
Clerk of District Court, Denver‘, surrendered maturedcoupons in his custody.

Payroll Deductions: Were comparedwith subsidiary records as adjusted. Remit-
tances to the agencies concerned were being made currently.

 In his talk to the busi-
,ness ymen’s forum group,
gfthe Labor Secretary said that
«henceforth, when the govern-
ment intervened in collective
"bargaining, it would not just
ﬁfnediate the outstanding and im-
; mediate issues but would define
land assert the national interest.
:7. “Speaking of a new and greater
.»,.-kind of . government influence
 on‘ labor-management relations,
Goldberg said the Administra-

.. _ tion has the “courage” to draw
 the ‘economic “guidelines” to
  protect the national interest in
. t I afworld in which domestic infla-
1 tion, wages, profits and price

.. levels can create international '

 crises. .

Labor in its goals should look
ahead “into the broad fields of
modern economic realities,” he
said, advising unions to stop

. CLARK, commenting on the
 speech, declared:
’ 5 “Secretary Go1dberg’s self-
 f’ described ‘labor - management
 philosophy’ boils down to inter-
C’-vention of the government in
.T-,._-tlie negotiation of wages and
::J1w6i‘king conditions, limitation
 of the-{rights of free workers in

The Mine-Mill president fur-

‘ marks about resistance to tech-

Factory Pay—
U.S. and Europe

Labor cost to the factory em-
ployer in Europe today is ap-
proximately $1.00 per hour. This
includes cash wages and the
value of all extras, such as so-

cial security charges, health-

benefits, vacations, etc. The
average‘ factory wage in the
U. S. last November, including
cash wages alone and not the
fringe benefits, was $2.36 per
hour.

These are the main findings
in a study made for the Execu-
tive Commission of the Euro-
pean Common Market. It cov-
ered 10,000’ companies and 4,-
000,000 workers in the common
market Jcountries——France, Italy,
West Germany, Belgium, Neth-
erlands and Luxembourg.

Chile Developments

Stevedores at San Antonio,
Chile, recently tied up the port,
piling up 15,000 tons of copper
and idling seven freighters at
-anchor, while causing the El
Teniente mill (a Kennecott prop-
erty) to run short of caustic
soda. Strike was over fringe
benefits. Terms of settlement of
the strike were not announced.

Meanwhile, contract talks are
going on right down to the wire
at Braden Copper, a Kennecott

subsidiary. Present contract ex-
pires March 31.

African Unrest

There were 20,868 African cop-
per workers in Northern Rho-
desia who voted late in Febru-
ary in favor of a strike against
the copper companies, including
subsidiaries of American Metal

Climax. Only 338 voted against 7
. the strike. Before the men walk

out, the strike will have to be
called by the supreme council of
the union.

Among the demands are an
increase to not less than 75 per-
cent 9f ' pay of’ white mine
workers.

Earlier,’ over 800 white mine
workers tied up the Mufulira
copper mine in Northern Rho-
desia for a week and’ a half over
the discharge of a white miner,
after a beef with an African
employee. The mine normally
produces 10,000 tons of copper
per month.

  

METAL MINING COMPANY PROFITS were generally favor-
able in 1961. Most major producers showed little change in garn-

ings as compared with 1960-some were higher, others lower- —

Here, are net profits as reported by various companies:

1960 1961
American Metal Climax _--_._--_._--_-----__--$38,704,766 $34,500,000
American Smelting & Refining  23,743,729 21,420,000

Kennecott 77,362,412 61,861,485
Magma-San Manuel _______.-____-.__-_-___- 8,079,659 9,557,053
Phelps Dodge 36,047,716 38,119,500

Kennecott Copper Corporation reported that its profits from
U.S. operations were greater in 1961 than in 1960, despite an
average selling price for copper 2c lower in 1961. Strikes and
taxes in Chile were blamed for the overall drop in income.

Phelps Dodge and Magma-San Manuel made bigger profits
in 1961 despite lower copper prices. Inspiration’s lower. profits in
1961 were caused by the three-week strike of the Machinists
last September and October and by heavy development costs
at the Company’s new Christmas mine. -

In line with his customary reticence, Clyde E. Weed, Anacond
chairman, avoided any reference to profitability of Montana
operations. But he blamed strikes and taxes in Chile, as well as
lower copper prices, -for the small drop last year of about 5%
percent in the company’s profits. . -

It seems clear that Anaconda, like other major ' copper pro-
ducers, increased its profits on mining, smelting and refining
operations in the U.S. last year, despite lower copper prices.

American Zinc, Lead and Smelting Co. showed the biggest

, relative drop in profits of the companies listed above. This, of

course, was’ a reflection of the slump in zinc prices last year and
a strike by the Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers Union at
Monsanto, I11. which cost the company $650,000, according to
Howard 1. Young, company president. All but about $15,000 of
American Zinc’s 1961 profit was earned after October 1, suggesting
better times are ahead for the company.

OFF-AGAIN, ON-AGAIN talks between government of Chile
and the Soviets for a five year, 300,000. ton copper deal warmed
up again in February after collapsing last January for the second
time in a little over a year.

‘Chile wants to sell tht? copper; the Soviets want to get it for
their expanding electrical generating and transmission network.
Stumbling block has been whether the deal was to be for cash,
or a swap for Russian industrial goods. ' L ._

Now Chile, previously insistent on an all cash deal, has
indicated the swap might be 0.K. if the Soviets would include
all the plant and spare parts for an oil refinery Chile wants

to build.

CADMIUM smelting and refining is a growing profit item

in the balance sheet of American Smelting and Refining Co. Most

of the ‘company’s cadmium refining operations are centered in
the historic Globeville smelter and refinery just north of Denver——
largest cadmium plant in the world. V

The company does not give out figures on profits made on
cadmium, but in 1962 it will make more than double the profit
earned by this plant just a few years ago. While there has been

some speedup and reduction in force with increased production, '

the big boost in profits ‘will come from upward movement in the
price of cadmium. Since September 1959, cadmium has increased
in price by.50 cents per pound, or by more than one-third.

COPPER SLAG conversion into iron and steel, long a dream in
Montana, moves closer to reality with completion of a confidential
study by U.S. Bureau of Mines, leaked in the trade paper, American
Metal Market late in February. ‘

The Bureau is said to have reported favorably on con-
struction of a plant to produce iron and steel from copper slag
in huge dumps at Anaconda, Montana. The Area Redevelopment
Administration is studying financing of the project, which would

‘require a total investment of over $40 million.

WASHINGTON, D. C. — The

“right-to-work” racket, heavily.

bankrolled by big business, turns
out to be ‘a mighty gold mine
for its promoters.

Forty-two percent of the total
take by the fund raisers of the
National Right-to-Work Commit-
tee was spent for promotion and
“services,” it was charged by
Cong. Ray J . Madden (‘D., Ind.).

The group, which is dedicated
to enactment of state and fed-
eral legislation to outlaw the
union shop and compulsory
union membership, was also the
bitter target of the Better Busi-
ness Bureau of New York.

In an insertion in the Congres-
sional Record, Cong. Madden
cited the Bureau’s report dis-
closing that “almost half” of the
dues and donations: of 15,000
members of the Right-to-Work
Committee had gone

Victory in Appeals C our,

(Continued from page 1)

to decomply Mine-Mill on the
charge of allegedly falsified
non-Communist affidavits. In
doing so,the Court unanimously
reaffirmed the union’s bargain-
ing_ rights under the Taft-Hart-
ley act.

Later that year the top Court
handed down its famous deci-
sion upsetting the conviction of
former staff member Clinton E.
Jencks, who had been accused
of falsifying Taft-Hartley affi-
davits.

*=k=l¢

.  THE third vindication of _the
- union and; its« leaders against

such charges came a little more
than a year ago, on Jan. 16,
1961,- when the high tribunal
threw out the conviction of for-
mer Secretary-Treasurer M. E.
Travis who, like Jencks, was
charged with falsifying Taft-
Hartley Inon-Communist affida-

vits. The Court that case C A

ruled that Travis had been im-
properly indicted and tried.
In view of these repeated vin-
dications of Mine-Mill's position
that there never-has been any

basis for the charges to begin

with, Clark declared: “We say

once again that the govern-

ment’s prosecution of these
cases is unwarranted, unjust
and a waste of the taxpayers’
money.”

The‘ appeal before the 10th '

Circuit Court here was argued
only last November by chief
defense counsel Telford Taylor.
Also part of the defense team

were Mine-Mill General Coun-.

sel Nathan Witt and Denver at-
torney George Francis.

before they were- brought to
trial in late 1959 at a time when
Mine-Mill was in the middle of
a 6%/2-month nation-wide copper
strike.‘

Charges against two of the
11 ‘defendants who stood trial
were dismissed by trial Judge
Alfred Arraj for lack of evi-
dence. They were Asbury How-
ard and Jack C. Marcotti. The

Statement on Case 

By President Clark 

DENVER——Fo1lowing is a statement by President Joh11‘;—.
Clark prepared for the Mine-Mill Union on the Court of Arp-I
peals decision in the Taft-Hartley conspiracy case: ~

The decision of the Court of Appeals in the conspiracy_‘
case is more than a victory for the nine appellants and for
Mine-Mill. It is another significant vindication of fu_n‘d‘a-2.‘ I.» a
mental legal principles. In recent years, prosecutors in so‘--_; 
called Communist cases have been under the illusion that"-2: 
evidence which would be laughed out of court in the usual *
criminal case is somehow admissible in cases involving the 6 _
Communist issue. Again, an appellant court has rejected suchﬁ

- a notion.

In this opinion, the Court of Appeals says that unless ,.
evidence is connected with a defendant, it is inadmissible. ,
_ Specifically, the Court said that what one Communist -in New, 2
York told another is not evidence against people who knew a
neither of them and have nothing to do with what was said

in New York

APPEAL of the case received’

wide-spread labor and liberal
support. Leading officials of
International unions, AFL-CIO
and independent, ‘spoke’ out in
support of Mine-Mill against
the Taft-Hartley attack, and
many of the “organizations for
which they spoke contributed
substantial funds to aid the de-
fense.

Among these prominent labor —

leaders were: -
Secretary-Treasurer Patrick
E. Gorman of the Amalgamated
Meatcutters & Butcher Work-
men; Secretary-Treasurer

Taﬂ-Hartley Case Reversal

DENVER—As the Mine-Mill Union went to press, several labor and liberal
leaders had already responded with congratulatory messages to the news of the

’ Mine-Mill Taft-Hartley _ case reversal.

Among these were Secretary-Treasurer Patrick E. Gorman -of the Amalgamated

trical, Radio, & Machine

Workers; President John P.’

Burke of the Int’l Pulp, Sulphite
& Paper Mill Workers; and
Norman Thom as, nationally
syndicated columnist and one
of the country’s foremost lib-
eral commentators on current
affairs.

. ' ' However, the decision is disappointing because it orders . '
the case dismissed as to two of the appellants but orders a_'.
new trial for the other seven. Eleven defendants weretried’ '
originally. Two were acquitted by the trial judge for lack
of evidence, although it was hard to distinguish their cases 
from that of the other nine. Now, two more have been ‘
ordered acquitted by the Court of Appeals, although it is _: '
hard to see how the cases of the other seven are different. T
The fact is that the. principle on. which the two were
acquitted should have led to the dismissal of all the,,cases._., ‘
The particular items of evidence are either insufficient org
not connected in any way with all the appellants. In short,
there was no adequate evidence of the alleged conspiracy./i I ‘
I think that the prosecution must recognize this and/will
not try to bring the seven to trial again. The likeﬁhood of
any conviction standingup is so remote that the only Ereason
for a second trial would be to harass the seven defendants?
and to try to injure Mine-Mill. Especially now that the non-.
Communist affidavit provision has been repealed, the indi‘c_t"'
ment in this case serves no useful or legitimate purpose.‘- '

In their messages to Mine-
Mill President Clark— ’ '

Gorman said: “I am “very
happy for your organization, for
you and for the officers who
suffered so long to win this final
sweet vindication by the de-
cision of the Court of Appeals.
