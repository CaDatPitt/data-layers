HELL IN THE HEAVENS

THE NEXT WAR
' WILL BE AN AIRPLANE WAR

Against Airplane Warfare There Is No Defense.

THE NEXT WAR
WILL MAKE THE WHOLE COUNTRY A BATTLEFIELD

THE NEXT WAR
WILL BE WAGED FROM THE AIR AGAINST
HELPLESS POPULATIONS

THE NEXT WAR
WILL DESTROY CIVILIZATION.

Armed Defense Is No Defense !

 

  

 

The War Department’s Air Circus !

During the month of May the Government staged a series of “air raids.”
Starting from Dayton, Ohio, 672 airplanes roared across the country,
costing the tax payers millions of dollars and bringing no beneﬁt to them;
indeed ri-sking life and property.

What is the use of such maneuvers?

They are intended to frighten us into voting larger and ever larger

appropriations for so-called “defense”.

Against Airplane Warfare There Is No Defense

How do we know this? Experts are of this opinion. The latest testimony
is given by the Red Cross.

Red Cross Finds No Way To Protect The Population
in the Next War

,..;,,.e,..,....,¢.,.,...,<.,.,...w..,,...,.,,.....,,..vW .. ,...., A/V

This is the conclusion arrived at by the Commission of chemists, physiolo-
gists, engineers and military men appointed by the Red Cross to investi-
gate the possibilities of safe-guarding non-combatants in war time. The
President of the Commission, Professor Andre Mayer, gave their report to
the 14th International Red Cross Conference, Brussels, October 10, 1930.
Professor Mayer reported that in modern warfare industrial establishments,
war materials and communications have become as important as soldiers.
The belligerents might consider it imperative to strike behind the battle-
front and destroy those institutions on which the life of a civilized country
depend-%factories and mills, the telephone, telegraph, electric service,
highways and railroads. The ﬁeld of battle would extend over the whole

of the country at war, for with the progress of aviation, every zone would

be under ﬁre of the enemy. It would be impossible to distinguish between

those engaged in war work and those who are not. War would be waged
against all the civilian population; women, children and the aged would be

exposed to the combined attacks of gas, explosives and incendiary devices,

for all these weapons could be used simultaneously.

Explosives and incendiary methods are already so developed that should
such bombs fall on great centers of population nothing would remain. The

report discusses the evacuation of cities, and asks how could such masses be
transported, sheltered and fed?

A second suggestion is that civilians be housed in gasproof, bombproof
and ﬁreproof fortresses, which would have to be prepared beforehand.
This would absorb the entire human activity in Europe for ten years if

sufficient protection were to be provided.

Thirdly, there is the manufacture of huge quantitie-s of gas masks. But
gas masks are not efﬁcacious. If a model were adopted, the enemy might

at any time learn its secret and ﬁnd a means of making it useless.

 

 

The conclusion of the report is that while the Red Cross would continue to
study all available methods of safe-guarding civilians against war, it
may be that the only way to destroy the root of the evil is to combat, not
this or that method of warfare but-—— War itself !

The United States has 125 Million Inhabitants

Can they all be provided with gas masks ?

A gas mask must be ﬁtted by an expert—— a slow process.

The tiniest flaw in a mask renders it useless.

Air raids may occur at night without warning.

The person wearing a mask can not eat or drink.

What about babies and small children— are they to wear gas masks 0?
New and more penetrating gases are being discovered.

Is this method of defense practical I’

Can We Defend 25 Million Cubic Miles ?

Major General Hansen E. Ely, commanding the Second Corps Area, in an
address, New York, April 25, 1931, said that a defending force of airplanes
should outnumber the attackers by at least four to one. lie estimates for
New York City and environs a minimum of 2,400 airplanes. At this rate
how many would be needed for the whole country‘? The United States
(continental) has an area of 3,026,789 square miles. The record altitude
of an airplane is 43,966 feet. So the area td be safeguarded is 25,203,734»

cubic miles!

While the 2,400 airplanes are “defending” New York City, what about the
rest of the country ?

If “defense” is useless, would it not be better to lay down our arms, employ

the 2 million dollars a day which the United States is now squandering on

defense to relieve unemployment, and put our tru-st in justice and fair play,

rather than in force ?

The United States should lead the world in disarmament. We have the safe-st
geographical position with no threatening neighbors. We are the creditor
nation and could bring about world disarmament, if we offered to release the
other nations from the war debts they owe us, on condition that they dis-
arm at once and totally. The plain people of the world) who pay the
penalty of militarism in taxes and lives would hail our offer with joy. It
would set them free from the double burden of debt— both what is owing
to; the United State-s and the taxes they have to pay their own govern-
ments in support of militarism. If any government was unwilling to accept
this offer, their people would compel them.

But the United States can not make this proposition in decency and justice

without ﬁrst disarming itself.
