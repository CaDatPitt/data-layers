only in terms of price; and price, he said, in the last
analysis was quantitatively immeasurable and meaningless.
He invited those of us in Washington who admired Veblen,
and could lift our minds above the pathology of money,
to join the Technical Alliance. Some of us did, myself
included. A A

The Alliance as a formal organization did not long
survive the upbeat to normalcy. Most of the members went
their various ways, sorrowfully perhaps, but inevitably.
Howard Scott, however, with a small residual group about

-him, kept on. He had a great idea by the tail and he

refused, to let go of it. Whether it was his idea or Veblen’s
idea I never knew and never cared. According to Mr. F. L.
Ackerman, who knew both men well, each had arrived
independently at substantially the same conclusions. The
impact of mechanical energy on the ﬁnancial system is
no one man’s idea. The laws of that impact, stated in
mathematical —- even ultra-mathematical — terms, Scott
took under his special and personal supervision. While
the New Era danced to its destruction, he continued —
supporting himself somehow, anyhow—to plot his curves
of energy, add to his amazing store of technical informa-
tion, develop his industrial philosophy.

Veblen died, and no salutes were ﬁred. A monument
was raised to the martyred Warren Gamaliel Harding. Two
movements developed in industry which, since they were
then in the womb of time, had not been discussedat length
in The Engineers and the Price System. They operated to
shift the thesis somewhat, but did not fundamentally damage
it. Both of them Scott and his group immediately took
into account. They were:

The rapid growth in the automatic factory (where the
machine does all the physical work), remote control, and
the automatic process, leading to what has come to be

8

 

 

 

«called technological unemployment. The ﬁrst automatic
factory appeared in 1915, but the movement did not become
general until the itwenties.

The recognition on the part of certain captains of
industry of the big-volume-low-price formula, superseding
the good old monopoly-high-price formula. The new
formula occasionally encouraged high wages to provide
popular purchasing power to take the big volume off the
market. ‘

It was found that more money could be made —flying
in the face of the principles of a thousand years of money-
making-—by going into mass production, increasing

mechanical power, decreasing manpower, reducing prices a

and raising wages. More proﬁt by raising wages. Shades
of Adam Smith!‘ But even the scepticism of the academic
economists melted as they viewed Mr. Henry Ford rolling
a golden snow-ball toward a billion dollars. No monopolist
on all-the-traﬂic-will-bear formula had ever rolled so lustily.
It was classically wrong, but it worked. That was enough
for pragmatic America. It admired and imitated. The
formula gained momentum all through the New Era.
Higher wages, lower costs. It seemed indeed all wrong.
So wrong that the dullest should have smelled a nigger
in the woodpile. Those four words fairly shouted that
something of the utmost importance, something revolution-
ary, had happened to industry. They meant, if anybody
had cared to give them ten minutes of intelligent attention,
that human labor was beginning to pass out of the picture
as the prime factor in the production of wealth. In an
automobile selling for $3,000, the direct labor cost was
found to be $180——a beggarly six percent of the whole
price. Not labor, not wages—but energy, locked up in
coal, petroleum, waterfalls, was what really counted.

Wages per man or per hour could be increased because the-

9

 

total wage bill was falling. Fewer and fewer men were
required to produce a given quantity of goods.

Scott saw this clearly. A few others saw it. Nor was the
other end of the formula less signiﬁcant. While the prices
of mass-produced commodities did not drastically decline
in most cases, costs, time and again, went into a regular tail-
spin. The new automatic and semi-automatic factories, at
capacity operation — twenty-four hours a day on a straight
line, continuous basis — could make things which once were
dear, unbelievably cheap. Safety razors, formerly priced
at ﬁve dollars, were given away with tubes of shaving cream.
Capacity operation, to be sure, could seldom be maintained;
prices were loaded with fantastic selling and advertising
costs; but the clear potentiality was there.

Direct labor, per unit of output, sliding downhill; costs
of production on a long glissade. The laws of physics
had captured two critical trenches; -one from the worker,
one from the captain of industry, and both from the price
system. The tension between the engineer and the banker
became more acute than even Veblen had sensed. The
balloon of credit inﬂation which had shadowed this vic-
tory for physics ﬁnally burst on an October morning in
1929. The Happiness Boys, headed by Mr. Hoover, pinned
on -badges, gathered in Rotary formation, and assured us
that nothing had happened. Now, after three years of
acute depression, even the voice of that champion of hog
callers, Mr. Charlie Schwab, is stilled.

About a year ago, as the conviction spread that some-
thing was very, very wrong indeed, members of the old
Technical Alliance began drifting back to ﬁnd o-ut what
Howard. Scott thought of it all. He had plenty to tell them.
And he had rechristened both his group and his industrial
philosophy, Technocracy.

The group began to grow. Presently it was found possi- A

10

 

 

ble, through the courtesy of Columbia University and the
American Institute of Architects, to turn some ﬁfty drafts-
men, for the moment unemployed, to work on the Energy
Survey of North America, which Scott had projected, but
had never been able adequately to ﬁnance. To date some
three hundred large charts have been completed, and it is
primarily the shattering conclusions deduced therefrom
which have set the newspaper boys swarming like bees,
turned‘ respectable bankers upside down, ﬁlled the pages

of foreign journals, and made Technocracy a household _

word. ,
What is Technocracy? It is Veblen pushed a few
steps forward, modiﬁed by recent industrial history and

‘Mr. Howard Scott. It is an attempt to measure by means

of ﬁgures and charts the impact of energy (the machine,
if you like the term better) on civilization. It is an expedi-
tion into the higher mathematics. It is a prophecy and a
challenge. It has hinted at a blue print of a possible new
societywhere economic activity is controlled by the tech-
nician, with a sixteen hour work week, but the blue print
has not yet been divulged. It is the‘ name of a group said
to consist of some 350 engineers and technical men. And,
if it is not careful, it may turn into an esoteric cult. . . .

The Attack on Technocracy

As I write, every item in the deﬁnition, save the ‘last,
is under criticism and attack. This was inevitable. What
Mr. Scott and his group have said, and particularly what

bright journalists with a taste for melodrama have said, is '

suﬂicient to stir a'hornet’s nest anywhere. Mr. Scott has
no hesitation in declaring that the impact of energy is
shattering the price system. Bankers in the breadline are
al-ways big news. “The nation stands at the threshold of
what is simultaneously opportunity and disaster. The oppor-

11

3/

 

tunity is one of social beneﬁt, the disaster is the failure of
the price system and neither opportunity nor disaster may
he escaped.“ Retaliation has been swift and reasonably
bitter — as why should it not? It is alleged:

1. That Mr. Scott’s character and past personal history
leave much to be desired. A

2. That the facts and ﬁgures so far released by the
Technocracy group are full of errors.

3. That, ip-so facto, the conclusions drawn from the
ﬁgures are wild, irresponsible and untrue.

Well, let us see. p

The personal character of Mr. Scott, or of ' any mem-
ber of his group, may or may not be subject to criticism,
but has nothing whatever to do with a series of quantitative
ﬁndings, and conclusions drawn therefrom, The question is
not whether Scott has lived in Greenwich Village or in
Lung Tung Pen, but what his ﬁgures show. The ﬁrst
charge may interest you, but it does not interest me, and

_ I shall say no more about it. I p-ersonally know that

Scott has devoted himself to this subject for nearly ﬁfteen
years with unrelenting zeal. —

Are the facts and ﬁgures sound? Well, what facts and
ﬁgures have we? Two varieties: the charts of the Energy
Survey, now in process at Columbia, and a miscellaneous
assortment of data bearing on new inventions, automatic
processes, technological unemployment, energy consumption
in other countries, and the like.

_ I have inspected perhaps thirty of the big charts of the
Energy Survey and have been informed that they are based
on Census material and other accredited sources of data.
I have checked one or two of them with such data and
found them substantially correct. Furthermore, I believe

I possess enough knowledge of the past industrial history
of the United States to aﬂirm that the curves, on such
charts as I have seen, follow the expected major tendencies.
_ Here, for instance, is the curve of the production of
steel for the last ﬁfty years. Here on the same chart is
the curve of horse-power expended in such production. Here
is the total number of workers in the steel industry, year
by year. Here is the curve showing man hours per unit
of output. The ﬁrst curve, production, rises steadily, until,
about 1907, it breaks into a series of violent oscillations.
The second, horse-power, climbs rapidly. The third, total
employment, rises more slowly, until about 1920 it begins
to decline. More production; fewer workers. The last
curve, man hours per unit of output, starts far up on the
left hand side of the chart and, bisecting the other curves,
heads remorselessly for zero on the lo-wer right hand corner.
The other charts exhibit much the same tendency; and we
know without verifying Technocracy’s ﬁgures in detail that
such is the tendency in American industrial history. The
charts, however, should be checked by impartial experts in
due time. I understand that a series of them are shortly
to be made public and the opportunity for careful veriﬁca-
tion thrown open.
The production and energy curves on chart after chart
warrant special attention. Following a reasonably smooth
upward trend for a long series of years, they begin to break,

some time after the turn of the century, into a fever of

increasingly violent oscillations. Take a whip with a long
lash. Hold the straight black handle at a rising angle.
Agitate the lash in violent vertical zigzags. This is what
many of Technocracy’s curves look like. It is only too clear
that the dams and barricades of the ﬁnancial system have
been throwing the physical system into a series of .increas-
ingly wild gyrations. (It should be pointed out, however,

13

that the production of consumers’ goods—ﬂour, meat,
clothing—-—show as a groupless violent oscillations than
in the case of producers’ goods——coal, copper, pig iron.)
It is clear also from the survey charts that the peak of
employment in physical production and transportationnwas
reached shortly before 1920, while the peak of production

‘ itself was reached in 1929 -— a decade later.

So much for the Energy Survey. Technocracy has from

A time to time set forth other facts dealing with new inven-

tions and special processes; dramatic contrasts have been
drawn. Mr. Scott for instance says, “If the total one
billion installed horse--power of the United States were
operated to full capacity, its output would be equivalent
to the human labor of over ﬁve times the present total
world population.” ‘ Mr. Bassett Jones, another distin-
guished member of the group, says, “In incandescent lamp
manufacture, one man-hour accomplishes as much as 9,000
man-hours accomplished only so short a time past at 1914.” 2
Mr. F. L. Ackerman says, “In 1920 the railroads employed
2,160,000 men; in 1930 they employed 1,300,000 men. Yet

y in 1929 the carriage of freight was 7 percent greater than
I in 192.0.” ' Scores of assertions of this nature have appeared
in the various press stories about Technocracy. It is doubt- '

ful if the reporters made them up; they must have secured
them somewhere, probably from members of the Tech-
nocracy group. It is not at all doubtful, however, that in
some cases the journalist garbled the ﬁgures. In the
Wayne Parrish‘ article in the November, 1932, New Out-
look, two ﬂatly contradictory statements are made about
pig iron production. -One or the other‘ is wrong.

These dramatic examples are open to more statistical
suspicion than the Energy Survey. ‘Many of them need

careful checking and rather ampler description than has
so far been given. There is, for instance, a statement
attributed to Technocracy that a new road machine is
capable of laying eight miles of surfaced road a day with
two workers on the machine.’ It is not explained that
to feed su-ch a machine, some 35 trucks must be in constant
attendance, while a large gang of hand laborers must
constantly be employed in constructing feeder roadways.

When‘ this qualiﬁcation is given full weight, the initial 
dramatic contrast fades. .We cannot know to what extent-

a given machine displaces labor until we know all the
surrounding facts. The stories about Technocracy have not
always supplied us with the collateral facts. Again, such
stories have given us the performance of ﬁgures of the
most eﬂicient plants—— some of them in the blue print stage
only —-so worded that many readers construe them as the
average performance ﬁgures of plants or processes in actual
operation. A ’

But here also I cannot doubt’ the tendency shown.
Machines are displacing men, swiftly, dramatically, terri-
bly. I have enough stored facts in my own ﬁles amply
to prove Technocracy’s general thesis in this connection.
Here is a random selection from my store:

From 1912 to 1927, the Buick Motor Company increased
its production 1400 percent, and its labor force only 10
percent. Energy made up the difference.

Two men can cut out about six boards in one day’s
hand sawing. Twomen with a power gang saw can out
60,000 feet of boards a day, and the hardest work they
do is to press an electric button. Their output would con-
struct four six-room houses.

In Proctor and Gamble’s soap factory, “Furnace, pump,

mill and tank apparatus do the work; men watch, control
and aid, but the force and rate of production is far outside
their power.”

In the Ruhr in 1913, 95 per cent of coal was mined
by hand; in 1926, only 33 percent. Machines had taken
over two-thirds of the job.

In the New York subways, eleven men used to operate
a ten-car train. Today, by virtue of automatic controls,
two men run it. Meanwhile, due to electric turnstiles, ten
ticket choppers have given way to a couple of change
makers. A

The hod-carrier has alinost disappeared in the face of
the power hoist. ‘ x

In the boiler room of the liner California three white-
uniformed ﬁremen, presiding over valves and gauges,
replace the usual ﬁreroom crew of 120 men — a 4,000 per-
cent shrinkage. 

The photo-electric cell, which never makes a mistake
and never knows fatigue,’ has been introduced to sort
vegetables, fruits and eggs, to measure illumination,
appraise colors, classify minerals, count bills and throw
out counterfeits, time horse races, count people and vehi-
cles, determine thicknessof cloth, see through fog, record
smoke in tunnels, inspect tin cans, substitute a new process
for photo-engraving, direct traﬂic automatically, open doors
at the approach of a waitress, count sheets of paper and
measure their thickness, automatically control trains —to
name only a few of its uses.

So much for facts and ﬁgures.‘ The trend I cannot

 

 

doubt, even though certain details may be erroneous or ‘

incomplete. We will proceed to the conclusions arising
from the ‘facts. This is the section of Technocracy’s work

 

which interests me most, and to which I shall devote the '

remainder of this pamphlet.

The industrial philosophy of Technocracy seems to fall
under three main headings:

1. An approach to industrial activity which rivets the
mind on physical things, rigorously excluding ﬁnancial
things. -

2. The conception of energy magnitudes as the condi-
tion governing social and political institutions. Men can
do only what available energy _—human, animal, or me-
chanical —— permits them to do. Energy may or may not
circumscribe their thinking; it does circumscribe their eco-
nomic and social behavior in ’a very cardinal way.

3. The physical facts of industrial development in
the United States in the past century, and particularly the
past ﬁfteen years, show a cause-and-result series which may
be written down in the form of a syllogism; a syllogism
capable of projection into the future, with shattering impli-
cations for the price system, the debt structure, the labor
movement, the whole traditional performance of business
enterprise. '

Let us consider these three elements in turn.

World Without Money

Much of the hostility against Technocracyarises from
the incapacity of the critic to think about economic activity
with dollar signs omitted. His early conditioning has
made such objectivity psychologically impossible. As an

‘ economist who has dealt largely in non-ﬁnancial phenomena

 

myself, I have frequently been subject to the same kind of
criticism. Those of us who try to look steadfastly at the
movement of men, materials, and energy, are obviously
long-haired theorists and impractical visionaries. The prac-
tical man is he who asks: “What will it cost? Who is
going to pay for it? How much proﬁt is there in it?”
The practical man, in short, is he who stakes his all on an

TECHNOCRACY

An
Interpretation

by STUART CHASE

Technocracy has suddenly stirred up a
hornets’ nest. Its advocates have not fully
stated their case. Its critics have rushed
to attack.

What is this new industrial philosophy?

Stuart Chase, who is not himself a mem-
ber of the group calling themselves tech-
nocrats, here presents a deﬁnition, an an-
alysis, and interpretative criticism. He
states thus the conclusions to be drawn

_from Technocracy’s data:

“The technical, arts cannot be halted.
As they march they are exploding
employment, money values and vested
interests. The price system cannot with-
stand an indeﬁnite series of such explo-
sions without collapse. At which point,
if we can keep our wits about us and
see that the collapse is one of paper
only, we have the opportunity to insti-
tute a more modern system, . . . perhaps
solving the economic problem for all
time. It should be operated, says Tech-
nocracy with charming modesty, by
technicians.”

abstraction, the dollar, which is immeasurable and undeﬁn- A

able. It may exchange for ﬁve pounds of rubber today
and twenty--ﬁve tomorrow. Money, as Mr. J. M. Keynes
has pointed out, is anything the state declares it to be. A
solid German citizen, who in 1903 had taken out a twenty-
year endowment policy for 100,000 marks, paid his pre-
miums on the nail until 1923, when the policy fell due. He
went and got his money, every mark of it, and the total at
the time was just suﬂicient to purchase a cheap straw hat.
So reliable and no more is the standard unit of the prac-
tical man.

Neither the Technocrats nor any one else concerned
with physical analysis would contend for an instant that
money in its fundamental sense of a medium of exchange,
is not important, or not to be reckoned with. Technocracy
indeed has devoted serious consideration to the debt struc-
ture in the course of its analysis. No. The point of the
physical approach is that it thrusts money back into its
proper relative position. Instead._ of being the whole of
life—as so many Americans pathologically believe—it
becomes only one element in the total economic picture, and,
on the basis of physical standards, a very crude and unsat-
isfactory element at the present time. In the nineteenth
century it worked rather better.

The dollar is in profound need of modiﬁcation and
modernization. Even bankers are beginning to admit this.
And the only sensible way to plan for a new and less
chaotic medium of exchange is to look steadfastly for a
time at the physical things which lie back of money, and
which, in the last analysis, give it whatever meaning it
possesses. Money is‘not wealth, but only a ticket permitting
one to take wealth. Wealth is the physical thing taken -
the shoes or the fur coat or the necklace. It is exceedingly
important to make this distinction, and the physical ap-

18

 

 

proach of Technocracy is thus something of which Ameri-
cans generally stand in bitter need, to restore perspective.
(Fortunately or unfortunately some millions of Americans
are going to have their perspective restored in 1933 by means
of barter exchanges and the creation of local “wooden”
money. They will learn that food, shelter and clothing do
not come out of banks, but out of their own efforts.)

Energy and Civilization

Technocracy sets before us three ﬁgures which, to the
physically-minded if not the money-minded observer, are
of commanding importance. .

Primitive communities, both ancient and modern, do work
primarily by virtue of the energy of the food eaten by their
members, converted into the physical power of human
muscle. The chief engine is the human being, and not
only the standard of living of the community but most of
its, social institutions are delimited by his available energy.
The power of the human engine (incidentally not very
efficient as engines go) is measurable. Its intake of food -
proteins, starches, and carbohydrates— is equivalent to
about 2,000 kilogram calories per capita per day. Such
is the lowest energy magnitude of homo sapiens; our base
line. It was in force universally until the ﬁrst civilization
arose in Mesopotamia about 7,000 years ago. It is still
in force in backward regions throughout the world. I saw
it in full operation in remote mountain villages in Mexico.
Hikers on a climbing trip live under its mandates and know
what it means. If there is physical work to be done, their
muscles must do it. Two thousand kilogram calories per
capita per day; _this is the ﬁrst ﬁgure. '

With the coming of early civilizations, new non-human
sources of energy were tapped. Horses were saddled, oxen
and bullocks harnessed. More use of ﬁre was made for

19

cooking and heating. A few clumsy waterwheels and wind-
mills were invented. Presently gunpowder was introduced.
The donkey and the carrot made their appearance in litera-
ure; the donkey’s function being to grind corn. ~By virtue

of these devices, animal, mechanical, and chemical, the 0

energy magnitude in favored communities was doubled;
4,000 kilogram calories per capital per day, according to
Professor A. B. Lamb of Harvard. Approximately half
of it came from man-power; half from non-human sources.
All civilizations, until the invention of a practical steam
engine in 1775, were constrained within this energy limit.
Standards of living, social institutions, were ﬁxed on a
4,000 kilogram calory base. The common law, the rights
and uses of p-roperty, the gold standard currency system,
the joint stock ‘company, the relationships between debtors
and creditors, the law of contracts, the Constitution of the
United States, were all developed in this energy magnitude.

Today, in the United States, the energy consumed by
virtue of coal, oil, natural gas and waterpower alone, is
the equivalent of 154,000 kilogram calories per capita per
day! If we add to this the time-honored 4,000 of earlier

civilizations—for men and animals still use their muscles ’

to a degree—-and add windmills, tidemills, rotor engines,

rocket ships, and other rarer forms, we secure a total of ‘

perhaps 160,000 or some forty times the energy limit of
all earlier cultures. The machine age has stepped up our
capacity to perform work forty-fold,’ and in doing it,

0 according to Technocracy, has stepped all over the common

law, the concepts of property, the gold standard, the price
system, and the Constitution. With energy -operating in
such c-olossal terms,‘ the institutions formed under far lower
quotas are increasingly incapable of functioning. They are

being shattered under the impact of this stupendous
mechanical power. Earlier depressions have indicated a
growing tension; the present depression shows that the
tension has become almost unendurable. Twentieth-century
power and eighteenth-century economic and political insti-
tutions, as Veblen said, cannot much longer tolerate each

'other’s company. One of them must go. It will not be

power, says Technocracy. Why? Because the technical
arts tend to advance by geometrical progression. Every
new invention lays the base for several more. Scientiﬁc
knowledge is cumulative. It cannot be "suppressed, reversed,
or blunted. Above all it cannot be stopped by refusing to
recognize it; by cuttingit dead. There the damn thing is.
It will not stand indeﬁnite barricading by captains of indus-
try, as this depression proves; it will not tolerate the
shackles of outmoded institutions. »

So, says Technocracy, if we cannot cut off the power
it might be wise to think about altering institutions.

Why did the ‘Spaniards conquer the Aztecs and the
Incas? Primarily because of horses and gunpowder.‘ The
Spanish lived in a 4,000 kilogram calory civilization, the
Americans in a 2,000; the latter had neither the energy of
draft animals nor that of guns. They were as brave as the
Spaniards and in their way at least as civilized. But they
lacked the crucial store of energy. The power of horses
and explosives was clearly supernatural to a people that
built stone pyramids by manpower. They were conquered.
If this is what can happen by virtue of only doubling an
energy magnitude, consider calmly the implication when
the magnitude is multiplied forty-fold.

The transition from one energy magnitude to another
has been quantitatively stated by Mr. Scott in a series of
very elaborate and very abstruse mathematical equations.
A good working knowledge of Einstein and the quantum

21

 

theory is said to be necessary to follow them with any
facility. They are beyond me; though I can understand,
and you can understand, the magnitudes in terms of 2, 4,
and 154-. Another theory pronounced by Scott is that the
amounts of energy necessary to produce commodities are
capable of exact measurement. So many ergs for a pair of
boots, so many for a razor blade, so many for an auto-
mobile. Energy, therefore, constitutes a more dependable
base for a medium of exchange than gold or silver. It is
an idea worth careful consideration.

We may summarize this section as follows: Here is a
horse and here is a stout buggy—say the Deacon’s one-hoss
shay. The buggy represents social institutions, the horse
an expenditure of energy. .The horse is hitched to the
buggy, and excellent progress is made—-considering the
state of the roads at the time. The combination works.
Presently Dobbin is released from the «buggy, the shafts are
removed, and a small steam engine is placed under the seat
and geared to the rear wheels. The buggy creaks, expostu-
lates, but moves. (I drove such a buggy in 1906. It was
called a ‘Stanley Steamer. It was steered with a tiller, and
blew up every 40 miles.) This combination leaves some-
thing to be desired, true, but it travels faster than a horse,
and it travels. It represents our economic history to the
end of the nineteenth century. Finally we eliminate the
small steam engine and sling a Lincoln motor, 100 horse-
power, beneath the buggy’s wheels. Transmission is made
and power is thrown on. The buggy lurches, shivers,
groans, and after a swift dash forward, flies into a thou-
sand fragments. . . .

The Basic Formula

nocracy’s industrial philosophy. Granted a great increase

in energy in the last hundred years, how, precisely, does
it affect us and our institutions? A friend of mine puts
it this way, a querulous note in his voice: “Well, we’ve
got a lot more energy than we used to have, any fool
knows that, and we’ve got a lot more things, and a lot
more money and credit. Even if the connection has jammed
temporarily, there is no reason why it can’t be brought
into line again. Why all the hullahalloo? Why should
these wild engineers be whipping out slide rules and
p-rophesying a grand smash?”

Let us try to answer my friend. ‘

As I see it the formula may be stated in some such
series as this:

1. In the United States we have developed energy
resources from coal, oil, natural gas, and water power

. until the total consumed has grown from 75 trillion British

Thermal Units in 1830 to 27,000 trillion B.T.U. in 1930‘;
while population has grown only twelve-fold.

2. We have developed prime movers (engines) to con-
vert this energy into horse-power, mechanical work, until
the total now approaches one billion horse--power —— capable
of performing as much work as 10 billion men, some 250
times the working population.

3. We have developed a bewildering variety of clever
machines to direct the brute power of the prime mover
into thousands of useful operations, in manufacturing,
agriculture, transportation, even in clerical work, merchan-
dising, housework. A .

4. By virtue of these energy sources, prime movers
and machines, the business of growing, manufacturing, and
transporting economic goods is enormously accelerated.
Due to the irresistible growth in the technical arts all three
factors become constantly more eﬂicient and more inter-
locked. The whole industrial system is approaching the

23

  

which depends on the operation of every other part. If
people in Texas do not consume automobiles, people in
Detroit cannot consume as much food, whereupon farmers
in Iowa cannot consume as many radios and harvesting
machines, whereupon . . . The self-suﬂicient local com-
munity has gone forever. We are all tied together with
chains of power and of steel. ‘

5. The tendency in manufacturing and power produc-
tion, and to a lesser degree in transportation, agriculture
and clerical work, is in the direction of the full automatic
process, where the machine does everything, the human
muscle nothing. Such labor as is required increasingly
takes the form of dial watching, control cabin work, switch
throwing, inspection and set up. Even in this domain the
photo-electric cell has been found to be a more dependable
switch thrower than any human hand or eye.

6. The result of this tendency is drastically to reduce
costs—measured in energy or money or labor power.
By virtue of standardization, and the extension of physical
and chemical research, cost can -be further reduced through
the factors of durability, high quality, and more accurate
design. Scott tells us that a razor blade with a tungsten
carbide edge, fabricated with only a 20 percent increase in
energy, would last fora generation.

7. Ultimately the costs of certain products——by no
means all —become so low that they approach theistatus
of air, water, sticks and stones. Their economic “value”
approaches zero. _ ‘A steel pin or a paper clip was once
an article of “value” and was carefully ‘preserved for
future use. Today, stamped out by the millions, we treat
them as cavalierly as we do water from the faucet. Many
commodities are headed in the same direction. Consider
second-hand motor cars today. Even when the cost of a
given essential commodity is not susceptible to drastic

status of one vast machine, the operation of every part of V

reduction, there is always the possibility of replacing it
with a substitute. Houses of lumber, brick, or stone are
diﬂicult to put into mass production. They are threatened
today by fabricated steel houses, turned out in sections by
the mile in automatic factories. Synthetic foods are a
growing menace to the farmer. The whole textile industry,
in both its agricultural and its manufacturing divisions,
may be undermined by some such ﬁbrous nettle plant as
ramie. As science develops, these threats to established
industries become increasingly severe.

& In the last one hundred years, the following tenden-
cies are observable :1

Energy has grown to the curve t”—- where t equals
time.

Debt has grown to the curve t‘.

Production has grown to the curve t’.

Population has grown toithe curve t’.

Man hours per unit of output to the curve minus t‘.

The whole Technocracy analysis is implicit in these
ﬁve curves.

Debt has been increasing faster than production, or
faster than tangible wealth. As debt comes to nothing but
a shower of paper without real wealth behind it, these
curves indicate a paradox which obviously cannot indeﬁ-
nitely continue. .

Here we have a series of eight facts and tendencies.
We can immediately draw certain major conclusions.

The decline in direct lab-or per unit of output as
mechanical energy is substituted for human muscle can
only lead to more and more technological unemploy-

ment. .

Technological unemployment, like all unemployment,
operates to reduce popular purchasing power. Yet

1Basett Jones in Electrical Engineering, November, 1932.

without a tremendous base of popular purchasing power,
modern industry cannot function. if

The automatic process operates to drive down costs
and ultimately prices, and so depress the “valuations”
of the price system.

The automatic process, due to its huge output in
relatively small space, reduces opportunities for proﬁt-
able investment. When one or two plants can supply
the nation, they may be very proﬁtable, but they under-
mine investment throughout the rest of the industry.

As bulk opportunities for proﬁtable investment
decline, the interest rate turns downward toward an
ultimate zero.

The burden of debt, based on processes rapidly
becoming obsolete, becomes increasingly intolerable.
We see this happening very clearly in the case of the
railroads. New energy forms have made certain func-
tions of the railroad obsolete over large areas. The
Reconstruction Finance Corporation," in trying to keep
 railroad debts intact, is in the last analysis defying the
 laws of physics. It is a losing ﬁght. Furthermore,
V5 to maintain the debt structure intact, production must
' increase by t‘, a compound interest rate, which is prob-

ably in excess of consumers’ wants and certainly in
1; excess of the purchasing power released by current
ﬁnancial methods, and in excess of the technical possi-
bilities of production and natural resources over an
extended period.

These conclusions‘ -cannot be controverted because they
are now in more or less active operation —- in boom periods",
observe, as well as in depressions. The question is, how
far ﬂung and important are the operations to date, and l
can the price system adjust itself to them? Technocracy
says they are dangerously far ﬂung and that the price

-§..:,~. ,«,—;_».-,.« ,

system cannot adjust itself. Technocracy’s critics say the

process is nascent only and can be accommodated within_

the price system. Before, however, we examine this crucial
question, there are two important corollaries of the basic
formula which should be listed.

The automatic process continually displaces the manual
worker. He secures a job, if he is lucky, in one of the
“service” trades, usually a white collar trade. He leaves,
or is thrown out of, the classic proletariat. What becomes
of the class struggle theory; where are the toiling masses,
without a worker in the plant? Photo-electric cells can
readily identify the color red, but they are diﬂicult. to
organize. Service trade workers are even more diﬂicult.
The oﬂicial labor movement, it is signiﬁcant to note, has
not progressed in the new mass production industries, and
in the next phase, the automatic industry, there will be
nobody to organize. When this development proceeds to a
certain point, which we may or may not yet have reached,
the whole Marxian thesis stands in need of substantial revi-
sion. Marx wrote in a time of far lower energy magni-
tudes. One suspects he would be the ﬁrst to recognize the
changed situation today.

As the proletariat declines in numbers and importance,
the technical class grows. The latter point, of course, was
cardinal in Veblen’s analysis. History may now be in
the process of creating a new industrial class, 'more im-
portant than worker, owner, creditor or ﬁnancial manager -
the men who understand and operate energy. Technocracy
is the ﬁrst formal organization of this class. As an organi-
zation it may be discredited; may fail. But if the laws of
physics are actually throwing up such a class, the idea
itistands for cannot fail. A new and stronger organization
will take its place.

Perhaps now without undue violence we may state this
new industrial philosophy in its simplest terms:

27

 TECHNOCRACY 

-_ AN
M INTERPRETAT 0N

 

The technical arts cannot be halted. As they march
they are exploding employment, money values and vested
interests. The price system cannot withstand an indeﬁ-
nite series of such explosions without collapse. At
which point, if we can keep» our w-its about us and see
that the collapse is one of paper only, we have the
opportunity to institute a more modern system, amen-
able to the laws of physics, capable of dealing with
154,000 /eilogram calory magnitudes and upwards, and
perhaps solving the economic problem for all time. It
should be operated, says T echnocracy with charming
modesty, by technicians.

What Is Wrong With This Picture?

Such is my interpretation of the conclusions to be
drawn from Technocracy’s data. What is wrong with them?
Broadly speaking, I can ﬁnd little wrong with them. They
coincide roughly with an industrial philosophy which I
have held for a long time -—- indeed, ever since I read
Veblen. I would raise, however, certain collateral “ques-
tions.

Why cannot the price system continue to stagger along
for another decade or two by virtue of inﬂation or the
devaluation of the dollar——-either of which operates to
reduce thetburden of debt? Neither offers any permanent
solution, but I strongly suspect that one or the other is
going to be tried whenever a collapse—-i.e., a wholesale
repudiation of debts——becomes suﬂiciently imminent.

Some authorities believe that the old system can stag-
ger along by stabilization on a low production, low stand-
ard of living, low income basis. Articles are already being
written in business journals to the effect that mass produc-
tion has been overdone. Back to nineteenth century frugal-
ities, hard work, and saving pennies. This means falling

28

 

 

 

down an elevator shaft of energy magnitudes. I incline to"

agree with Technocracy that scientific’ development is an
irreversible process. It might possibly be hammered to
pieces b-y a stupendous war or revolution, but it would
hardly tolerate stabilization on an 1890 basis. The auto-
matic process is the best and cheapest’ way to, produce
goods. It cannot be closed up and discarded. The only
hope lies in social control of its relentless advance.

This raises a further question, however. How far has
the automatic process actually gone? I have a drawerful
of cases similar to those I have cited, and probably Tech-
nocracy has more. But my drawerful, while it may account
for two or three million men on the street, and threaten
millions more, is certainly not powerful enough yet to over-
turn a system. I have seen one factory, 400 feet long,
capable at capacity operation of supplying the whole
national demand for automobile frames——- 10,000 frames at
day. If there are several hundred plants like this in actual
operation, or ‘ready to be put into operation, each capable
of supplying all, or a huge fraction of, the national demand
for its product, I can readily visualize the breakdown of
the price system in a remarkably short time. I have reason
to believe that there are not hundreds of such plants as yet.
They are coming, yes, but they are not here. It will take
a few more years to get them here. The blueprints are
quite possibly ready, but the bankers are not. Indeed we
may require another inﬂationary boom to secure enough
automatic factories and processes to make good the threat
of imminent breakdown. In brief, I am not nearly so
sure of the time factor as Technocracy appears to be.

0 Again, how long can industry maintain, to put it bluntly,
the annual model racket? The manufacture of quick
replacement goods uses up a lot of energy and employs a
lot of labor. It is probably true that if every plant today
started to produce the best product of which it was capable,

29

 

-the factor of durability would be so high --things would

last so long —-—- that the price system would be water-logged
within a year. Most of the factories would have to close
for lack of reorders. But the fact remains that the price
system has kept aﬂoat on shoddy, wasteful, quick replace-
ment goods (the dams and barricades again), and proposes,
so far as I know, to continue to do so. We consumers are
becoming somewhat fatigued with it, to be sure, but there is
little real revolt in us—- yet. We shall continue for a time
to buy -boots that open to the breezes in six months, when
it is perfectly possible, technically, to make boots which
would last until we were sick of the sight of them. How
much more life is there in the replacement method? Tech-
nocracy says very little. I am not so sure. I
Again there is the question of new industries-brand
new industries. It is painfully obvious that a new industry
like ramie, which threatens to capsize the whole standing
textile investment, gets the old system nowhere except down-
hill. There may well be opportunities however for the
development of commodities and services hitherto unknown.
The automobile was such a development and created
4,000,000 new jobs out of thin air. How about air.condi-
tioning, or a fool-proof airplane———to mention two life-savers
which have been proposed? It will have to be a very large
new industry (or group of industries) capable of absorbing
literally millions of workers. It will have to avoid a great

output on the automatic process basis, because such a basis .

provides comparatively few jobs. Frankly, I see no such
industry on the horizon. Technocracy appears to discount
the idea altogether in the sense that it can really shore up
the price system. But such an industry just possibly might
arrive.

Slum clearance and housing on a grand scale have been
proposed to keep us aﬂoat. In so far as the new houses
were mass produced of fabricated steel, the project would

30

 

 

---—-g.v——— «~«~%....,,..,,-..._,_,_. . . . , ;, 4

 

be hopeless, in that it would wreck real estate valuations
in old housing areas. A banker, shown a model of an
$1800 fabricated house, equipped with all modern con-
veniences, said: “Splendid! But it would ruin my busi-
ness.” In so far as the new housing was of the old type —
stone, brick, wood— it is the universal opinion of experts
that it can be developed in the grand'manner only by
state subsidy. Private capital cannot afford to touch it.
Socialized housing, observe, would not be shoring up the
old system. It would be a radical step towards a new col-
lective system. The vested interests could be counted on
to oppose it implacably. .
Finally, to return to our collateral questions, is th
production of tangible goods all of economic activity?
Assuredly not. Economic activity includes many valuable
services not susceptible to measurement in terms of energy
—the work of teachers, doctors, artists, professional base-
ball players, traﬂic oﬂicers, research workers. In 1930
roughly half as many people were employed in the “service”
trades as in the production and distribution of physical
goods. The ratio has been growing rapidly in recent years,
especially since 1920. How far can the old system keep
aﬂoat on the purchasing power of’ service workers rather
than factory workers? They must ﬁt into the whole eco-
nomic picture in a large and deﬁnite way, and I do not
see clearly where Technocracy in its pronouncements to
date allows for them. Many essential services seem to lie
outside the concept of energy magnitudes altogether.
This brings us to consumers’ choices and human nature
generally. Whenever a critic desires to refute any body
of doctrine in this republic, he says, first, that it is inspired
from Moscow; second, that it is against human nature.
Technocracy, it appears, is both, and immediately is en-
deared to me. At the same time I should like to know
where the service trades ﬁt in, and how a painting is to be

31

measured in ergs. I can readily ‘comprehend an energy
system conﬁning itself to physical things, like a water
system conﬁning itself to supplying the people of a given
city with water. But as Technocracy’s analysis stands, it
accounts for only about half, or to be generous, two-thirds,
of the present economic total. For all I know, a million
men could, by 1950, make and distribute all the essential
physical goods which one hundred million people could
consume. What arrangements—necessarily economic ar-

rangements—should be made to cover the activities of the

rest of’.,,the workers?

And‘: what about consumers’ choices in the physical
budget?\ I realize that there is considerable nonsense talked
about an unlimited ceiling of consumers’ wants. Some
millions of us in 1929 were beginning to feel that we had
too much stuff already to take care of. There is no such
unlimited ceiling. But though the total tonnage has a limit,
there is a serious question of variety within that limit. You
like radios and I would not have one in the house. I want
to wear rough sports clothes and you like smooth and silky
clothes. Furthermore, mass production at best can only
approximately ﬁt human individuals, their bodies or their
tastes. This makes national budget-making complicated, and

requires far more intensive consideration than has yet been I

devoted to it. It is probably not insoluble.

I cannot, therefore, take my energy economics straight.
I require a chaser of psychology and anthropology. It
does not follow that either Veblen’s or Technocracy’s con-
clusions are shaky, only that they do not go far enough.
The total economic. problem is not comprehended. As
far as they go, however-—and in their -cardinal domain
they plough deep—these conclusions, and the data on
which they are based, constitute perhaps the most arresting
challenge which the American industrial system has ever

faced.

N 1919, Thorstein Veblen, the greatest economist
whom America has produced, published a book entitled
The Engineers and the Price System. His thesis was that
the engineer and the technician had made industry “inordi-
nately productive,” capable of throwing off a huge and
mounting volume of goods. The men who controlled
industry, however, the vested interests, the ‘priests of the
price system, were not disposed to give this productivity
full sway. Seeking maximum proﬁt in terms of dollars,
they proceeded to throw dams and barricades across the
smooth functioning of the engineer’s industrial mechan-
isms, and they sabotaged production to the level of what
the traﬁic would hear. New inventions were used, but
judiciously used; always in the interest of the greatest
immediate money proﬁt to be made out of them.

This, ..said Veblen, is all very well for the captains of
industry, but it tends dangerously to irritate the delicate,
highly specialized organism of modern machine produc-
tion. These artiﬁcial dams and barricades are likely in
the course of time to break down the physical layout of
power lines, railroads, factories, mechanized farms, ware-
houses, stores — which the technical arts have been making
ever more productive, eﬂicient and interlocking. The cap-
tains of industry are, as it were, defying the laws of
physics. They know a good deal about the manipulation
of money, credit and high ﬁnance, but they do not know
a turbine from .a b-us b-ar. They think these machines
are toys to play with. But the machines are not toys;
they are the means, the overwhelming means, by which

5

 

the people of a continent are fed, housed and clothed; and
they operate only by virtue of certain physical laws of
energy and dynamics which have a sequence, an integra-
tion and a rhythm that cannot be indeﬁnitely outraged.
Furthermore, the one hundred thousand technicians,

more or less, who alone are capable of operating these"

mechanisms, also have a probable saturation point of out-
rage. Given a free hand to operate at capacity on the
principle of the balanced load, they could d.eluge the nation
with sound and durable goods. Yet they are continually
forced ;by the captains of industry to violate their stand-
ards of craftsmanship by adulteration, peak loading, the
manufacture of trash, by stoppages, excessive selling and
advertising costs, cross hauling, patent monopolies, tariffs,
overexpansion, waste. And so Veblen suggested, without
enthusiasm, delicately, that the engineers—— who could
bring the whole economic system to comp-lete quiescence in
a few days’ time——di_sallow the dams and barricades of
the captains of industry, and proceed to vindicate their
integrity, and justify their technical training, by taking
over the industrial system and operatingit on the princi-
ples of the laws of physics and of the balanced l-oad; the
latter meaning smooth operation at capacity, where the
cost per unit of output is at a minimum. Incidentally, their
fellow citizens, down to the last family, would enjoy a
standard of living hitherto undreamed of.

Here is a sample of his reasoning:

“It has been argued, and it seems not unreasonable to
believe, that the established order of business enterprise,
vested rights and commercialized nationalism, is due.pres-
ently to go under in‘ a muddle of shame and confusion,
because it is no longer a practicable system of industrial
management under the conditions created by the later state
of the industrial arts. Twentieth century technology has

6

 

outgrown the eighteenth-century system of vested rights . . .
and all the while it is an open secret that with a reasonab-ly
free hand the production experts would today [1919] readily
increase the various ordinary output of industry by several
fold—variously, estimated at some 300 to 1200 per cent.
And what stands in the way of so increasing the ordinary
output of goods and services is business as usual. . . . So
also, to these men who are trained in the stubborn logic of
technology, nothing is quite real that cannot be stated in
terms of tangible performance; and they are accordingly
coming to understand that the whole fabric of credit and
corporation ﬁnance is a tissue of make-believe.”

I read the book and was immensely stimulated by it. '

But it was too far in advance o-f its time to make a deep
popular impression. The nation, sick of the idealisms of
a war for democracy, prepared to return to normalcy with
an overwhelming yearning. Shortly after the book was
published, there drifted into Washington, where I was living
at the time, a tall, gaunt, somewhat mysterious young man
by the name of Howard. Scott. He announced himself as
an engineer but lately engaged at Muscle Shoals. He too
had read Veblen, and better, had been talking to him in
New York. He had been talking to Charles P. Steinmetz,
the “electrical wizard of Schenectady”; he had been talk-
ing to Dr. Wesley C. Mitchell; to many people. He
announced the organization of a group called the Technical
Alliance, to give concrete expression to Veblen’s challenge.
B-ut Mr. Scott, delivering an amazing ﬂow of technical
informati-on and discovery, sidewise, out of a wry mouth,
was obviously no man’s disciple. He had ideas of his
own, some of them far more lofty and far more mathe-
matical than anything Veblen had advanced. His dis-
respect for economists, with the sole exceptions of Veblen
and Mitchell, was profane and profound. They could think
