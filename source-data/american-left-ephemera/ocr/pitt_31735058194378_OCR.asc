Eastman Company to cut wage dividend I

The E'as-tman Kodak Comrpany will cut
one third oil‘ the wage d+iv'iden~d of each
worker. '.l‘«h«is decision was arrived at by
the IIlld‘l11S‘iI'lal Economy Dept., and adopted
by the company which will announce it be-
fore the next wage dividend.

According to the information w«i*xicl1 we
have at hand the details of the plan, which
are still bc-ing worked out in the in.du.strial
economy department, provide for a deduc-
tion of one-third of each workers wage

dvivid-end each year to be placed in a s-pe-'

cial pension fund, controlled by company
appoin,te(l officials. ‘When a worker reaches
the -age _of 65, he or she can retire and
take adv-an‘tage of this fund providing he
has worked for the oomspany a number of
years. . This ‘scheme makes no provisions
for workers leaving or being ﬁred before
they reach their 65th birtihday. Members
of the Industrial Economy Dept. who are
reszponisible for the "plan point out ‘that the
loya-ly and the steadiness of the workers
will be greiatliy «increased as a result of its
adoption as few workers would care to
leave the ﬁrm when they know thaét they
.ha~x=.: -a*certasin sum 't2’ee§‘ug'> .in’it. 1"-‘ J‘ i
[The whole scheme will be instituted by
the company without any effort to deter-
mine the wishes of the w'orke.rs, the com-
pany assuming that right under the terms

of the wage dividend award as printed in’

the slip given with the wage dividend each
year.

DEMAND DECENT WASH ROOMS

Editor Kodak VVorker:
Jilere is a condition of which the East-

vmcan :Kodak Company -ought to be asihamed.

I work in building No. 25 in the Reel
Gauging Dept. On 'th:is ﬂoor the wash room
is very sm~al‘l, only two wash bowls an-d
two toilets. Most of the time there are
about 35 girls working here, some times
more. VVe had no dressing roo-m until a
few we ks a g.,when. they built, us ‘ ' tuifé
a Fina» A corner on thei-?‘I'061s:
lockers are right out in the open and the
only place we could dhange our clothes was
right in this small wash room. "ll:-f7x."eybe you
can imagine the jam that we had there
every day at quitting time. The bosses
give as their reason for this condition that
this is only a temporary quarters. but I
have been working here more than a year
and the department was already here when
I started here. It d-oesn’t look as though
we are going to move into larger quarters
very soon eizth-er. I agree with what you
always preach in your paper that if the
working people, girls included, stuck up for
their nights they would not have to put up
wit-l1 su-ch rotten conditions a.s they do.

I am wishing you good luck with your
paper. '

‘Our '

Editor, -Kodak VVorker:

I have ‘been Working in the Roll Coating
Dept. at Kodak Park for the last couple
of years until a couple of weeks -ago when
I had to quit -on account of a breakdown
in my healzth caused by the excessive heat
and fumes in building No. 20. I reported
my case t-o Dr. Slater- The only ad-vice he
gave me was to quit in case I failed to get
a transfer to -another job. I applied to the
employment manager for a transfer. He
kept stalling me off every day so ﬁnally I
decided that n1y ihenalth is more valuable
to n1e than my bum job at Kodak Park.

In the R011 Ooating you never get a
chance to show what you -can do or to push
yourself ahead’ unless you are one of
Miehaelrs “monkey-s.” I read the Kodak
VVorker every month. I ‘appreciate it very
much but t-here is one thing that ‘I would
like to say, and that is, VVl1at -is the use
of all this talking so much? What We
want is action and imzmedi.-ate action. My
advice to kodak workers isvto get together
immediately andform a union. Then —“Un-

SUPPORT OUR $100 SUSTAINING FUND

The Kodak Worker is facing a crisis. Un-
less it is able to raise the amount needed
each issue to cover the printing bill it will
have to suspend. The editors of the Kodak
Worker dislike to make this appeal in every
issue and would not have to do so if every
worker contributed at least one cent for
his or her copy. To tide us over the win-
ter months and place the paper on a self-
sustaining basis we have decided to raise
$100 by making a special appeal to all
workers in Kodak Park. This amount to-
getner Wltn‘ ‘vnat ls received wnen the

our ﬁnancial worries for about one year.
Now, fellow workers, send in. your bit.

PROTEST AGAINST THE COMPANY’S
NEW “BENEVOLENCE”

‘There seems to be no limit to the “benev-
olence” of -our bosses. In the past they
have conﬁned th-em.-selvevsi to endowing us
with wage dividends and stocks. Realiz-
ing as they n1:u-st show diﬁicult we ﬁnd i-t to
spend our dividends, they are now going
to assist us also in this respect. VVe are
informed that the «bosses are planning to

take one third of each -Kodak em'ployees’_

wage dividend each year and place it into
a pension fund to be controlled «by company

years old and remaining in the employ of

the company?

This scheme likeiall ‘welfare schemes of
the comp-any, is made in the interests of
the bosses, the big ‘stockholders. It is
being adopted without any c;onv_cern about
our opinion in the niatter. It is intended to
tie us more se-cure'l.y to the apron ‘strings of
the company, to niiake more ab_]eet, more
submissive slaves of us, in that way coun-
teracting any inﬂuence for a lxoduak Work-

much waste, it is also responsible for the

' FACTORY

Toilets used by office workers throughout
the ‘Kodak factory have doors on the stalls,
while toilets used by the factory workers
have no doors. Why the dis-criininatiori?
Why should a worker in overalls or in
apron be made to feel that he is less human
than a white collared worker? Does this
condition exist as ‘a part of the efﬁciency
system forced on us by the Palmer gang of
parasites, or has the Company no coiinnon
decency in its -treaitinenrt of factory
workers ‘.7.

Vilh-a:tever' the’ re,-a°son.s are,’we \‘work‘ei"s
have the right to demand doors on the
toilet stalls. We demand no discrimination
and the same privacy for all. If the coin-
pany lacks common decen-cy, -then we work-
ers‘ must enforce it. Away with this
vicious spying even when workers are sat-
isfying their IN3.'lL11I‘al needs.

ARE WE CONVICTS
VVhy does the Eastman -Kodak Co. coni-

pcl every worker on getting a job to be "

phoitograplie-d and numbered as if he or she
were entering some jaiil? \Vhy imust we
bear the mark of our slavery to this coni-
pany about our ‘persons as the chattle slave
of old bore his irons and collar?

There is -only one reason of which we
can think and that is that the identiﬁca-

WHY NOT POST THE KODAK

MAGAZINE?
WE '.l‘l'lII\'-K:

The company, when posting our Kodak
\Vorkcr on its bulletin boards in ‘the fac-
tory is eminently unfair to its own worthy
editor, Mr. Spencer Hord, of the Kodak
Magazine. VVhy give us all the publicity
and neglect the giants of Mr. Hord’s in-
telect? W’e suggest, ‘therefore, in fairness
to Mr. Hord that the company post his
magazine alongside -the Kodak VVorker.

For instance the article in the Ju-’ly issue
on “get_2t'ing ﬁred.” or the one in the August
issue on “VVanted—a hard working man,
never late, willing to work over-time, keep-
ing his mouth shut, etc?’ “These are won-
dcrfularticles a.nd it’s possible that some
workers miss them; that would be a
calnamti-ty. Just inuagine a worker missing
the great lesson -published in his interest.
So let’s have the two -extremes. Post the
Kodak Magazine.

EASTMAN GIVES $25,000 TO HOOVER
FUND

The Republican naltional campaign com-
mittee recently announced that it has re-
ceived a $25,000 contribution from Mr.
George Eastman. And why shouldn’t Mr.
Eastman contribulte liberally to Mr. Hoov-
ers’ earnpai-gn\ fund. It’s -a darned good in-
vestment -that Mr. Eastman made. Mr.
Eastman is an open-shopper, an enemy of
the workers. ‘He, has installed and is 1 x-
tending the srpee up system in all of ﬁi-s
plants. want more production for lss
pay. He is prepared to ﬁgh-t bitterly any
attempts to organize the workers in the
Eastmnan plants. Thics is the program of
all weal=t'l1y em-ployers. Mr. Eastman there-
fore naturally favors a government that
will cfiiciently protect his interests against
the workers.

HOOVER ALSO LABOR HATER

That “Herbie” will provide such a gov-
ernmenlt «after he is elected is a certainty.
He i-s an engineer and an advocate of ef-
ﬁcliency and-speed up. His party like the
‘party of “Al” Smith is «the party of big
business. Tlrat is why big business sup-
ports these two parties.

WORKERS SHOULD SUPPORT OWN
PARTY

We must learn a lesson from our bosses
in this respect. VVe mrust support the par-
ty of llabor. The only party that dares to
ﬁght -a-g‘-ainst the open-shop Eastn'1~an’s,
L\l-organs, R0-ckefellers, Raskobs, etc., is the
VVovrkers C0ll'1'In‘U.I1l'St' Party. The E-astmans
do not -contribute even one cent to this
party. It’s campaign fund is contributed
by ‘the \vorkers in the factories, mills and
mines whose .in>teres't~s it defends. Fellow
Workers. answer Mr. Eastman’s support of
the Republican party by voting the Com-
munist ticket. Conrtrirbutev to the Commun-
ist caiiwaign fund. But most important

MR. GREEN AND THE KODAK WORKER

Mr. VV-m. F. Green, "president of the
American Federation of Label‘, thinks, or
at least pretends «to, that our charge-s of
corruption and betrayal, levelled at him and
his family of job holding labor fakers, are
unfair. In discussing our open letter at
the recent convention he whines, “They
accuse us of not making any mttexirpts to
organize the workers of Rochester. \Ve are
not to blame. Let those who make the
charges ‘take into consi-deration the con-
ditions prevailing here”—-—implying thereby
that conditions ‘here are not sufficiently rot-
ten  warrant organizational efforts.

That :this implication is ridiculous is ob-
vious to any intelligent worker. ” Let us
be fair however and judge these gentlemen
by the work which the convention, under
their d-irection, accomuplished. Aside from
having it-hemselveus re-elected to oﬂ‘ice, their
con-vention made only one positive achieve-
ment, the endorsemen-t of Al Smith for
president, the same A1 who in his accep-
tance speech pledged his allegiance to the
most notoriously slave driving, mos-t vig-
orously anti-union interests in this coun-
try, the General Motors interests.

Vitavl problems concerning the welf-are
of the working class s-u-ch as demanding

'relief for the unemployed, organization of

the unorganized masses of the workers,
a-mnalgamat-ion of the small craft unions into
great industrial unions which cquld ef-
fectively dight against the big employers,
building. of a labor party to give political
expression to the needs of t‘he workers in-
stead of supporting -the parties o-f the
bosses, all of these -problems were con-
venienltly ignored. As "for the striking coal
miners, the New Bedford textile strikers,
the steel strikers. of Canton, Ohio, etc., not
only was no assiistanicey extended to them
but the Greens, Lewises, VVolls, etc.. de-
liberastely break these strikes in their
eagerness to "prove to -the bosses their
worthiness as l-i-cksrpittlles. If any proof to
substanrtiate our charges against these gen-
tlemen =is needed their recent state conven-
tion affiord-s plenty of it.

standards and against the exploitative sys-
