‘Statement by University of Washington Students for a Democratic Society to the Press
22 October 1968

Mayor Braman's statement that Students for a Democratic Society, Peace and Freedom
Party, and the Black Panther Party are conspirators and promoters of racial unrest and
guerilla warfare in Seattle is a bald faced lie. The mayor's comments are political
in nature in a political year. They are a clear attempt to thwart the campaigns of
the Peace and Freedom Party and the Black Panther Party which SDS has endorsed. They‘

are an attempt to discredit in the eyes of the public the views of these political
organizations.

The mayor is correct that there are conspirators in Seattle. Mayor Braman, Chief
RENOD: Prosecutor Carroll, the City Council, and perhaps others, are conspiring to
incite racial conflict and to quash political dissent. Up to this time, the Black
Panther Party has been harassed most often. The recent murder of Welton Armstead by
the Seattle Police and the attacks on Aaron Dixon, Curtis Harris, and other members
of the Black Panther Party are evidence to this fact.

Proecutor Carroll's record in inciting racial conflict is well known and documented
in a recent Seattle Magazine article. Mayor Braan's and the City Council's role in
the passage of an unconstitutional gun control ordinance directed at the Black Panther
Party points to their complicity in this conspiracy. Chief Ramon's role in the July
disturbances is further evidence to the organized attempt at harassment of the black
community by the city officials. ‘

The administration of the University of Washington is also engaged in a campaign to
discredit these organizations. It has made overt attempts to provoke confrontations
on the campus and to drive a wedge between faculty and students. The recent pamphlets
sent out by the administration to the faculty indicate that their primary targets are

again Students for a Democratic Society, Peace and Freedom Party, and the Black Panther
Party .

The nature of Mayor Braman's attack has led us to investigate the possibility of
bringing a lawsuit against the mayor for defamation of character. Our attorneys are
currently considering the matter.

The oly figment of truth in Mayor Bramsn's charge is that SDB, the Peace and
Freddum Party; and the Black Panther Party share the semen goal of bringing
jutice to Seattle and to the United States.
