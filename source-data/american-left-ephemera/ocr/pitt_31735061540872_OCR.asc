THE WORLD BANKRUPT.

L Now» gentlemen, I maintainTthat the world
is bankrupt. The “waste and’ exploitation prior
to and during thipswworld war, together with

 

the ﬁnishing up of the means of production,"

dis~tribution.and communiication, leaving no
place for thereinvestment of capital, has made
the world bankrupt. ,

J The public debt of France is greater than
her national wealth. Germany's public debt
is greater than her national wealth. Italy is
practically as badly off. England sold under
the hammer would not bring enough to pay
her public debt. I will admit that the United
States is in the best ﬁnancial condition of any

tain that our nation is in an alarming condition.
If every dollar's worth of wealth in the
United States were put up and sold at public
auction, it would not bring enough to pay the
public debt and running expenses of the ad-
ministration for two years. Now, gentlemen,
this may not be alarming to you, but it is to
' me, and I ask you to seriously consider this

as» matter with me before it is too late.

 

if we close our eyes to these conditions I
fear, and seriously fear, an internal revolution
such as historyha-s never witnessed.

If we close our‘ eyesitto thetafact that'capital~*
ism (like primitive communism, ancient chattel
slavery, and medieval serfclom) has ‘reached
its historic end; if we close our eyes to the evo- i
lutioni oforganizecl society, we will act in an
extremely foolish and dangerously foolish,
manner. 30 again, gentlemen, I‘ ask you to
seriously consider well with me thesetcondi—l

' tions.

up through the lower order of animals; that
we inherit many of our traits from the lower
animals._ ‘ ‘

THE CAPITALIST CLASS.

The capitalists have‘ inherited their vicious-

ness from the lion, their cunning from the fox,

‘their instinct from the wild goose ,and their
pecuniary eye from the eagle. When _it is

cold, he goes to the sunny south; when it 
hot, he goes to the mountains to get the breeze

from the arctic regions. When. he is hungry.

for proﬁts, he organizes and ‘directs political

governments which grant him title deeds and 

franchises to all places of wealth production,

,watches the workers produce the flesh and

ﬂeece, then pouncesgupon them and takes all
but the hide, bones and guts. iWe may cage
him, but he will retain his tusk and claws. The
only way we will ever be able to civilize him
will be to create a condition in which he will
be able to use neither tusk nor claws in get-
ting his living, and, as a result of disuse, they

will disappear. Then he will become a civil- -

ized producer.
. ‘THE  CLASS.

The working class inherits two principal
traits of_ character, one from the ruminant ani«
mal, the other from’ the hyena. One species

stupid, timid animal. V While the working class
has been typifying this animal for thousands
of years, he isnow fast becoming a rummager.
He is now looking into every nook and corner,
searching high and low, turning over the old
clothes of all the history of the past, searchi.ng
for information that will lead himi to a’knowl~
edge of why he has to be a drudge  subduing
that which furnished the eagle-eyed lions of

human society with thick flesh and ﬂeece that
they have enjoyed, while the workers have
produced it all. The workers gotinothing but r

Lenine, Trotsky and Tchicherin and all the

revolutionists of Russia. This is the trait of,

character that drove Karl Leibknecht, Rosa

Luxemberg and thousands of othersVinto‘the_ A
jaws of death. This is the trait of characters

that kicked the czaroff his throne and set‘ ﬁre
to the seat of the kaiser's pants when he fell
off his throne and skipped to Holland. - This is
what dominates Debs, Haywood, Mooney,
Mrs. 0'1-late and thousands of others. Now,

A gentlemen, these untamable characters are
right here in the United States. During the A

war we called them yellow and ourselves red.
After the war we called them red, but we
failed to name ourselves. We have tried every
conceivable torture to suppress them. We
mobbed them, tarred and feathered them,
horsewhipped, imprisoned, and‘ deported
them, but, gentlemen, we have failed to con-
quer" them.

In fagt, gentlemen, after a close review of

the history of man, and a study of this untam~i

able trait of character in man, I have decided
that we have used the wrong tactics forgthe
suppression of that .« class called the "Reds".
The'Tzar tried the same tactics in Russia, but,

gentlemen, they did not work. If you think
they did, go to Russia and look» for the Tzar.

Now, gentlemen, many of these untamable‘
characters which we call Reds arein prison in’
this country, but instead of that suppressing
them, it tends to breeding more reds.

N0 BLOODY REVOLUTION. A

Now, gentlemen, if it begin our power, we
should avert a bloody revolution inggithis coune
try. Civilization demands it, common sense
demands it, reason demands it, suftering hu~

‘ are perfectly innocent and phelpless, the

Before making /my recommendations to

you, gentlemen, permit ‘me to “restate the fact
that the capitalist class‘ has ‘completed (or
practically completed) the “means of produc-
tion, distribution and communication; there
can be no further progress along these line be-
cause the world cannot use any greater means
of production, distribution and communica-
tion. It will be impossible for the capitalist
class to keep the working class employed from
now on, for the reason that there will be noth-
ing for the workers to do except to keep the ;~
means of production, distribution and com- in

Yes, we rmay have to put thetnation under
martial law for a while until thingsvlget settled
down and iniworking order. But gentlemen,
my honest conviction is that this course is the

only one that will avert a bloody revolution,

and I am opposed to any further human

slaughter if it is possible to prevent it. My _

judgment is that the Working class will not
starve to death at the doors of closed fac-

tories, neither will they submit to seeing their

children suffer for want of bread very long.

INDUSTRIAL socuzrr.

Now gentlemen, I maintain that industrial
society is as deﬁnite and certain to become the

apex of organized society as we, the human 1

race, through struggle evolved to the apex of
the ape family.

Now gentlemen, the constitution of the
United States gives you the POWER to make
all LAWS.

INAUGURAL ADDRESS 27

Gentlemen, in this statement Ihave placed
before you the facts as they stand. Ihave

also made the recommendaticihs that my judg— .

ment dictates. Now, permit me tosay, that if
you see this matter as I do and concur ‘with
me in the course tobe pursued, BElVlEN AND
FEAR NOTHING. ‘ e

The constitution of t_h.e—VUnited States rinakesl
me the military chief of the army, navy, and
all the, state's. military power} { Article  Sec~
tion 2, says: ”  L.

"The President shall be colmmander—ir'i--chief[of the

army and navy of the United States, and of the
militia of the several states when called into the

‘ actual service of therUnited,States.,"

Now ge‘ntlemen,you know that this power
has been used to establish cappitalism»a_ndnpro—_

_ tect the capitalistclass since the formation of .
this governmentijin I787. 'pThe fundirflttntalnp

principles which broughtthis Republiclintlo ex;
istence is set forth in the Declaration of In—

dependence, beginning with paragraph 2,.

which reads as follows‘:

“Werhold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are treated equal; that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness». That to secure these rights, governments are
institutedamong men, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed; that whenever any form

 

  

"than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to

‘K of organized society, the question is SHALL
WE DO IT. However, gentlemen, I hope

    

28' INAUGURAL ADDRESS

  

of government becomes destructive of these ends, it
is the right of thepeople to alter or abolish it, and to
institute a new government, laying its foundation on
such principles, and organizing its powers in such
form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their .V
safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate . 
that governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and, accord-
ingly, all experience hath shown, that mankind are
more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferahle,

 

 

which they are accustomed. But, when a long train
of abuses and iusurpations, pursuing invariably the
same object, evinces a design to reduce thein under
absolute despotism, it is their right,——it is their
duty,-——to throw off such government, and to provide
new guards for their future security."

Gentlemen, knowing i that capitalism has
ieachecl its historic end, and knowing that in-
clustrial society‘ must follow capitalism, that we
have the constitutional right and power to use
all our bmilitary power to set capitalism aside
and establish and maintain a scientific system

that we will not have to use the armed power.
I think to ﬂood the nation with this address,
with your sanction, it will prepare all’ honest
thinking people to accept our course in mak-
ing the change" from capitalism to scientiﬁc
industrialism. I hope that therthinking ele-
ment will be able to control the unthinking,

element without any blood being shed. -

Now gentlemen, in my closing remarks, per-
mit me to say I hope that your knowledge of
past history and the study of the evolution of
animated matter together with your knowledge

  

of the inevitable law of evolution of human so- '

ciety, has forced each and every one of you to g

the same conclusions that it has me,‘ and that
our deliberation and action in dealing with this
problem, the world’s greatest, will be in per-
fect harmony. ' ' V A
Assuring you, gentlemen, that I am faith-
ful to every man, woman and child in this na-

. tion, yes every one on this earth,

‘Wage slavery may be prolonged
by a military coercion but it cannot
have a successor in any other form
of human slavery. Military -coercion

prolonged chattel slavery, and by so

_ doing brought what is known as the

dark ages upon the world. If wage

_ slavery is to be prolonged by military

coercion the world must pass through
a second dark age. The league of
nations is ﬁxing for this; but let us
hope that this coalition will not stand
and that wage slavery will soon be

followed by machine slavery, the

form of slavery which will end '

human slavery.

as ’ ‘

James Madison, our fourth Presi-
dent, nearly one hundred years ago,
saw dimly what is now fully realized
by every student of economics. nHe
said: i

“We are free today substantially, but. the

day will come when our Republic will be an e

IMPOSSIBILITY. It will be an impossibility
because wealth will be concentrated in the
hands of a few. A republic CANNOT
STAND UPON BAYONETS, and when" that
day comes, when_ the wealth of the nation
will be in the hands of a few‘, then we
MUST rely upon the wisdom of the BEST
elements in thecountry to readjust the laws
of the nation to the changed conditions.”

Capitalism having completed its his

toric misison in l9l2, can only exist‘

now as ‘a coercive MOB.

the world. The recognition of the conditions
that now prevail, and the cause of their
existence, as well as the presentation of a
solution, is the important woork of this ad-
ministration. In order that we may under-
stand each other and be understood, I wish
to review the history of the human race from

iindividualism through primitive communism,

chattel slavery, feudalism and capitalism, up
to its present stage. By no other means will
we beable to act, intelligently. It is impossible
to know theposition wenow occupy except

through the study of the past. . '

No change can be made without a change
infthe material basis. In the individualist
stage, when man. fought the beast, for possibly
a million years, it was impossible for the
human race to dominate and control the beast
by individual effort. Hence, to control the
beast, they were compelled to make a material
change. To make any change from indi-
vidualism, it must naturally take the form of
collectivism. They united into groups, or
communes. l '

COMMUNISM. J

By uniting into groups, man learned that
much of the burden of» gathering his food

 

 

 

INAUGURAL ADDRESS 9

could be shifted from man to the beast. For
instance, man saw a calf" sucking a cow. He
also saw a babe sucking a woman. He de-
cided that both were getting food. He caught
the young calf and tied it withrbark; The
mother ofithe calf would come to feed her
young. The man would approach nearer
from time to‘ time; after a while, the man stays
with the calf until the cow goes outto get
more grass, manufacturing more milk, and
comes back to feed her young. ‘This time she

ﬁnds the man at the otherend ofithe bark

rope. The man either overpowers the cow,
in her weakness from bearing the offspring and
the shortage of food, or worries with her until
she permits him’ to learn how to get theimilk
she manufactured out of grass, which he takes
for his food. All the manpdoes is to tie the
calf, so when theicow comes‘ to feed the. calf,
the man gets the most and best of the milk.

So man began to domesticate and exploit 

animals.

The human m_ales see thefemales dig roots,

the males, being physically stronger than the «

females, whip them, and take away the food
they have labored to get. The male human‘
being then began to domesticate, enslavetand
