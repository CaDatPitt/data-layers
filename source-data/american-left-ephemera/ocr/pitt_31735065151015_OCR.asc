 HEN YOU READ this‘column,’the election

 , results will be in. Nomatter who wins, these re- p
A I sults will have an effect on the general welfare and on ..

organized labor. This 1954 campaign will go down as one

of the dirtiest and most distorted in li1s_tory. .
Supporters of the Republican administration made

every despicable type of accusation in order to maintain

’ their control. They had several purposes: to continue -

the giveaway program, to continue their takeaway of

   the common people’s’ economic security, to build up a

greater monopolistic empire,.'to create conformity of all
ﬂminds by fear and repression. ..

' Issues affecting the people were hidden behind a

general barrage of “treason-communi_st” charges. All

A, opposition including the.Democratic Party as an organi-
‘I zation, was attacked on this “treason” basis.

Did the Roosevelt administration take us out of the

~ -mire of -Hoover's depression, did it give us bank deposit

guarantees, unemployment benefits, _old age_ pension,

overtime pay, minimum wages and manyother 1I_n.po_rtant

-' gains‘? All these were attacked by the Republican cam-

paigners as “socialistic” or “communistic.”

THE Mosfrj DIABOLICALLY-CONCEIVED piece of .

 1egisla'tion—-which has been called Public “Gag” Law 637
. .-——was passedbythe last Congress in the throes of a
W deliberately-created hysteria. Today our Union, like
_ other unions, is preparing itself for an attack by this
Brownell-Butler anti-labor law. _ , K
t This law, under the guise of attacking communism,
actually has the open intent to destroy labor unions by
government licensing, by ordering who shall or shall not
be an officer of every union, and by forcing union mem-
bers and leaders to conform to therules, policies and
thoughts laid down ‘by the appointed judges on a govern-
ment board. _ . _
 This means only one thing, complete control of labor
unions by the government administrators, a return of
. -company unionism and the open shop ‘days.
This was exactly the goal of,industry—which drew
up and sponsored this law. I ’ ‘

. The criteria laid down as. to the principles and poli-

eeies on -which you and your union are judged leaves no

'-" all .-avenues of opposition or protest or the right "of? free
- expression. ‘ ‘ ‘ - y ‘

I i A . I ,
3  0 YOU WANT Mine-‘Mill to‘be a militant union ?' To
fight as we have in tl-t.epas.t..against an anti-union indus-

, try ?‘ To dare to reject conformity? Do you value your 4
.{ right under the Mine-Mill constitution to free expression? J;

' E The Brownell-Butler Act ..says all these are outlawed.
According to the New York Times, members of Con-
; Qgress rushed home to tell their constituents -how they
I ‘, had saved the nation by enacting this bill—without even
 knowing what was in it. The Times reported that a
week after adjournment there was nowhere a copy of
the bill asrfinally approved and signed by President

Eisenhower. . . ‘ ' I‘ ‘

The “Catholic Worker,” commenting on the law,
" said: “Men may still speak"out,,at a great price. Fewer
speak. Yet all these laws are part‘ of a massive, deep,
pk unprecedented movement toward a police state. Their
source”is almost always the same, the political bank-

‘ ruptcy of American capitalism in a hostile world.”

{BECAUSE OF OUR union’s independent stand on po-
litical issues, because of our unmatched gains for our
. membership-in the economic and welfare fields, we are
t bound to come under the attack of those who will admin-
sister this article of destruction. = '_ 3 ’
.. The groundwork for an attack has been laid through

I .the abortive actions of those in.CIO who disliked our
,_ free and independent stand in the labor movement. It

 .f has been laid by the subsequent Humphrey and McCarran 1

 hearings based on the_ CIO’s_ rump"hearings, on the lying
: testimony of professional informers such as Matusow

, who since has admitted to lies and distortions in his

j presentation of evidence.

. _'§~w The groundwork has been laid by the NLRB in its
delaying of elections and its other attempts to weaken.
* -our _un1on’s_ bargaining rights. The now well-known
_ Travis case 1S part of this. The Jencks case is another

step in the same long—term scheme. '

 FIGHT _OF this Union has been for gains for
_ its Inembership in the economic field, for consolidation of
these gains through legislation, and for a peaceful econ-
- . emy instead of the non-productive dollar economy of war.
5- T: . _ We have been very ‘frank in this fight. We have
. said, what we meant and meant what we said. I am sure
the membership supports this union’s policy, and are part
-  and parcel of the frank way in which it is carried out.
— I am doublyvsure that whatever attack is made upon us,
‘ w_e_wil_l' find a ‘solidly united membership fighting to
"maintain our position as a union which carries out the
h  -policies and programs set bythose members.

clear. . I
C One is that the indictment comes five"‘and one-half f
years after I signed the first T-H affidavit. The latesg ’ -
date on the indictment is December 3, 1952. _ Why di ’
they wait-‘until October 28, 19542  it I _ .. i
I Another is that the whole thing fits into the pattern ,
of election hysteria whipped up by the Republicans as " 1;
they trieddesperately to keep their slippery hold on *
Congress. ’ V V
The indictment was no big surprise”. For 10 days
I or more, I knew that Eckert, Rasmussen, Homer Wilson
James Leary and the rest of the stable of ex-Mine—MilI
stoolpigeons werehanging around the Albany Hotel lobby
in Denver.

We knew also from speeches and press interviews of "

But there are a couple of points that seem pretty‘ . i

' ‘I ». e loyers in our industry that our union had been singled

out for “punishment” because of our leadership  setting .
new wage/standards. 5 ‘

l .

  EXAMPLE  ‘the kind of tactics which williibe

used to get a conviction ‘has already taken place. No
less than four of J. Edgar Hoover's “boy -scouts” called .
on an International staff nnamber and threatened to use '-
a minorincome tax defection to ‘put him in the-hoosegow, 
if he didn’t"testify against me. They were politely told7 K’
to —-go to hell.’ i ' ‘
h It is clear~now that the attack against our Union,
its leaders and members will continue under thei’l‘aft-
Hartley Law, the Brownell-Butler Law and any other _
kind of anti-labor weapons available. However,_ I am con- " '
Vvinced that our membership is prepared to face these
attacks on -their Union/and their living standards as they ,_.
have in the past. The attacks will be defeated, and our’; 
Union will win. ‘_ , I A‘ V, V H  
 One of theekeys to winning is to take advantage. of-‘ . '-
the remarkable -opportunity -:exis'ting- today pp -f01T_.Iab0l‘~‘ ; 
unity. ~We .notevw_rith keenzinterest the signs of poss-ible *5
- merger between the AFL and CIO.” Although the mighty; : ‘ 
Unite‘d¥Mi-ne Workers scoffsat these efforts, led‘ by 
Meany and “Sliding Scale’? Réuther, I feel that the work- ~.jf;f
’ers ‘in the United" States and Canada will 'con_tinue_to 
‘force their leaders toward unity and even possible mer- , ,
ger. _ - .  ._ ;

/T

IN THE SQUAREID s.trikein' Detroit, led by the United 
Electrical_W-orkers, we saw the amazing, sight (for these _,
times) of UAW Secretary Emil Mazey along, with offi-.
. cials of other Unions fighting on the picket line side by_
side with members of _UE against a vicious employer. The  _
I UAW members ‘in Detroit knew that the UE fight was - L
theirs, because they would be nextif this wage cutting - 
attempt was not defeated. ‘ .. 'l . 1 ' _   ‘
There°,is the same realization among some leaders ,,
and members of CFO and AFL Unions that “they will»  A
be next” to face -therattacks against- them under the
Brownell-Butler and Taft-Hartley Laws,
tongue-in-cheek Ives Amendment.

In oursindustry, the kind of unity at lower levels  p
which has been achieved among the Anaconda and Kenne- . , T
cottworkers particularly, but in many other sections of 
"our industry as well, has paid off in pork chops for our v 
members. Of course, any form of unity must take into. _ 
account the fact that our Union is the dominantone in‘; 
p The‘ AFL, CIO“and_i ‘ 
other unions accept the bargaining patterns which we are  :1’ ,'

Without the leadership of our Union in achieving .5,‘
these things, the workers in the non-ferrous metals induis-‘ ‘

filed a- grievance and began to -

L In Colorado, J ohnsten arranged
for a series of cleverly-worded
ads casting doubt on the patriot-
ism ’ of John ,A. Carroll, Demo-
cratic candidate for U. St. Senate.
And whereas all the polls before
the ads began showed ‘Carroll
leading by a wide kmargin, he.‘
lost the election by »a ‘few thou-
sand -vobes.‘ McCarthy - Brownell
tactics worked in Colorado.

Clinton Anderson, running for
re-election as, U. S. Senator from
New Mexico, won in spite of a
nasty red smear. But Glen Tay-
lor, running for Senator in Idaho,
lost to Republican Henry Dwor-
shak after being hit by a Jenner
Committee smear in Washington,‘
timedto hit the papers just be-

I f ore’ election day.

In Arizona, Republican Party
leaders’ demanded that Demo-
cratic candidates join them in at-
tacking ‘Mine-Mill. Up to the
very end, they tried to make
Mine-ltlill an issue in the cam-
paign, instead of watergand other
crucially ,importa—nt. Southwest
issues. Yet Ernest McFarland,
Democratic candidates for Gov-
ernor, won, as did Stuart Udall,
running for Congress in the 2nd
District. Mine-Mivllolocals and all
of Arizona labor supported botlr
McFarland, and Udall.

reactionary, McCarthy-type red-

Senator, beat incumbent Repub-

programs. 7' ‘

Because of Mine-Mill support,
both McFarland and Udall rolled

up huge votes in the cotinties and
precincts where Mine-Mill mem-
bers "live. Robert. 1\7Iorrison,- who
was subjected to viciouspersonal
slander/in his race for attorney
general, defeated‘ the “unbeat-

candidates won seats, including

sfrikes for seniorify    

HOLDEN, Washington——The story about this strike has whiskers. That's what

the strike is all about.

Two hundred fifty members of Mine-Mill's Chelan Miners Union, Local 3-79, are
in their second week of strike against the Howe Sound Co. in this isolated mining
camp in the Cascade mountains. And when you shake down the differences between

the union and the company it comes out-—wl1_iskers.
“Whiskers” means seniority. The man with the w_ . _ _ _ e
Uncle Sam, but the man with the seniority. And seniority rights in this camp, the

miners will tell you, are about as non-existent as Notre Dame fans on the Southern

Methodist Campus.

hiskers inthis case is not your

Custornarily, the Howe -Sound Go., an outfit‘ with six operations in three countries ’

. -—the U. S., Canada,‘ and Mexico—waits until the “Big Four” in the non-ferrous metals

industry settles with Mine-Mill before it gets serious about collective bargaining each

year.’ This year was no exception.
Howe Sound was “serious

best jobs and the manlwith the
whiskers be damned. It’s been
that way ever. since”Local 379
was chartered back in 1937. And
it’s been getting worse in recent
years.

I_’rior to the time the strike
began, October 24, the union and
the company had been in agree-
ment on most clauses in a new
contract, including the Coeur
"id-’Alenes wage pattern, the fur-
nishing of rubber clothes, and
some increased benefits under
health and welfare. ‘
Offer-‘withdrawn 9

But the company got “tough”
about seniority rights and some
other basic fringe benefits. The
men voted unanimously to re-
ject the company's “offer,”
since they were determined to
break down the “favorite son”

system on promotions and job .

posting. The company withdrew

its “offer.”

The men say they don’t know
a job is open most of the time
and that when they do find out
about it there's a shifter’s friend
in the job aild-an eligible old
timer with far greateiﬂseniority
“favorite” is
out of luck.

Financial Secretary
Kurland says: . ' A

“We don’t want ‘bumping’
rights, but we do insist that" if
a man has seniority over some
othercandidate for a given job,

George

77

and if hetcan prove‘ his capabili-

ties in ten days’ time, then the '

older man.-has a right to that
job.” - - ~
Depf. seniority‘

The coinpany pretends in its
public position that this is the
case now. It contends that the
‘requirementsgnow are seniority
plus capability. But that’s a

, falsehood, the strikers say, and

that’s"why they’re out. All the

‘men have now, Brother Kiirland

says," is what is laughingly.
called “department seniority.”

This means that a man with two

months’ seniority can get a job

over a man with two years”
seniority. It also» means. that

when an old timer is transferred

to another_ department he loses

all of his seniority rights and

starts over again.-. '

This is a company town—lock,
stock, and the one telephone_
line. When a person leaves town
to visit Chelan forty-odd miles
down the lake, Spokane, Wenat-
chee, or what have you,‘ he says"
he’s “going out:” It’s a little like
the-plirascology around an army
or. navy base. “Going out” is not
easy, especially in winter when
the snow piles up six or seven
feet high. And‘ there’s;'only two
ways “out”iand one of them. is
not by automobile. *‘ ’ ‘

The Queen Mary ‘

downhill to 'IJuc'erne and then 

9

_ , enough 'u_n'ti—l it found out that the union had decided
it wanted to end the system here by which the company installs its favorites in’ the‘

the "little boat do-wn Lake
Chelan. The miners call it the
“Queen Mary.” It takesabout
three hours to go the 40 miles
to Chelan where you can get a
bus if you want-to go further.

The other way is to call a taxi,"

except-that the taxi in thiscase
is a small seaplane. And you
still have to take the bus: to

Lucerne, _a lakeside settlement. .

The bus to the boat or plane
costs‘ you $1.10. The boat costs
you “$3.80 round trip. The plane
costs you nine bucks each way
between Lucerne and Chelan.
The boat runs once ‘a day, each
way. The plane runs anytime
you have the nine bucks -and get
a call through.

The schools in Holden go
through the eighth grade. When
yourkids have graduated from
elementaily school they must
go to high school. And lots of
them do live away from home
to attend high school, but it all
costs money. ' ‘

Holden has a modest hos-
pital, a store, a post office, a
recreation hall, a ,mess hall, a
“fountain lunch,” a small li-
brary, and movies three times

It was the morning after elec-
tion andthe United Press had
announced at 11:15 a. m. in
New York that only upsets in

New Jersey or Montana could A
cost the Democrats control of‘

the Senate. They had already
won control of the House. I ‘de-
cided to‘ call Neversweaet Slim"
back home, , remembering that
he was on night shift. I

“Make’it snappy, buster,” he
said. “"here’s another newscast
coming‘ on in a few minutes and
I’m up to you—know-where in

ure things out.” -

I asked him about the senate
race back home and he snort-ed.‘

“One thing is sure about these
results, Buster, and that’s that
labor in the Rocky Mountain
West has got some more po-
litical organizing to do! _Another
thing is sure and that’s that the
