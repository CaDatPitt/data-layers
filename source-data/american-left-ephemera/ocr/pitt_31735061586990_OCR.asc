-He said, "I’ll tell you what’s happened."
.This man, incidentally, was the switch vote in‘
"the ratification resolution we passed, and he
was a-graduate of the Naval Academy and an
ex naval officer of high rank. He said that

the preachers of these two ’churches were right
wing organizers and they were using these
congregations to destroy very moderate bills.
And that they were passing off as indeed the

. average person. ,

He thought it was a serious trend and
that the professional politicians up there knew
exactly what it was, but in fact, they
frequently used them as covers because they
were frequently there to defeat bills that were
business bills and money bills and bills that
you would like to have other excuses for
voting the way you’re voting than the lobby
that was pressuring you there for profit
motive alone. i

It was the first time I had bumped into
this explanation, but it wasn’t going to be the
last. _ ~ - 

At the end of the ’77 season we saw the
‘following things: we went down in Nevada, we

' went down in North Carolina, we went down

in Florida, and we went down by a couple of
votes except for Nevada, where it was a little
bigger margin, and in each case we went into
the vote with enough votes to win, but ERA
votes switched at the last moment, and they
switched for clearly unexplainable reasons. I
mean, we just didn’t have a good logical
reason. The reasons given to the press we‘
knew were not true. We knew the districts too
well. In fact, we knew they were pro,-ERA
districts but the votes were switched at the last
minute. - '

We believed then,and we believe more
now that there was another force operating.
So the summer of ’77, I commissioned a study,
a thorough research, of who the opposition
was. I felt you can’t win a battle, you can’t
even conduct it intelligently, unless you know
‘who they are.

We found the following facts: Stop-ERA
major leaders and organizers (and we did have
at time their entire state list) were primarily

politicos from the right wing. They were not '

housewives who had dropped their dishcloths,
and run to the fields to protect their homes
from the women’s libbers. In fact, they were
just the reverse, they were political operatives
who had been very active in things like the
American Independent Party‘ and the
Conservative Caucus. In fact, when we traced

Page 8

their names, their names were con'nected with 

prominent men in those institutions, and not 
only that, they tended to not be married in the 
first place, but professional career people (a . ''
good many of them, by the way, from public
relations. backgrounds).

Secondly, we found that they were not
only with the -Conservative Caucus and the _
American Independent Party, but people who .
had been connected with international
anti-Communist organizations. For example,
Schlafly’s husband, Fred Schlafly, who we
don’t hear much from these days, wasa
prominent organizer of three international
anti-Communist groups. One is the Cardinal
Mindzenty Fund, which is headquartered in -
St. Louis and is primarily an international

body fighting what they call Communism but  "

for what we would call very, very right wing

objectives. And so another aspect of the right  

wing surfaced in our research.

We were among the first of the V _ »
progressive constituencies who began to say
the new right isn’t so new at all. It’s the old

right in new clothing. And indeed these are
political operatives who are trying to sell an r.
economic theory that can’t fly unless it is _ '
wrapped up in different cloth. "And that is
what we believed then, and we believe it‘

now. ' ‘

“Actually, we're part of the military-ind-ustrial-
theologzcal complex.” '

HELL’S ANGELS

But I still was not satisfied with the
research because there was always the missing
link of who these people were, why they were
there, and was there a money link? I hate to
be so cynica1,but I always was looking for the
bottom line. And we kept looking. In the

‘other campaigns that followed, we picked up

additional information. We were constantly
exploring, constantly researching, constantly ,
keeping questions in our mind of what it was
we were fighting.

- One of the things that we were told again
and again was that we were fighting \_
conservative religious forces and conservative
rural forces. We were told that the Farm

‘Bureau was out against us and that the Farm

Bureau represented (you should be so foolish)
farmers. But we found out, indeed, the Farm
Bureau did not represent farmers. As a
matter of fact, the Farm Bureau owns and
operations some 44 insurance companies.
Thereare more members of the Farm Bureau
in Cook County (that’s Chicago), than
downstate where the farmers are in the state
of Illinois.

Instates like Oklahoma, legislators would
pull us aside and say, "Don’t you know who the
Farm Bureau really is?" and "The Farm
Bureau is really insurance." And they kept
telling us that and kept telling us that, and we

. began to realize and have more interest in

researching the insurance connection to
discrimination and why it was that they
wanted to defeat the Equal Rights
Amendment. That was certainly a money
link. ‘

YOUR SLIP IS" SHOWING.

There were other money links. We
noticed that. the pattern of all right-wing votes
was similar, that the Chamber of Commerce
and the NationallAssociation of
Manufacturers were constantly funding and
supporting the groups that were on the other
side. These groups, on business bills, were
supporting a strong profit-motive vote, and we
saw those patterns.

We then began to look at the contribution
lists of major right-wing groups. This is not
easy to do. Fortunately we have PAC laws
that tell you that you have to register and you
have to submit your donors. But in many of
these groups, there is no place that we can find
their list of donors. So you have to piece
things together.

One of the things that we -found was that
there was, on the opposition, a group called the

. Mountain States Legal Foundation. The

Mountain States Legal Foundation was the
group that took ERA Extension to court, if

‘you remember, in the extension case that was

fought in that inf.a’mous Judge Callister’s
courtroom in Idaho. We began looking at that
Mountain States Foundation“ and found that
there were a dozen such foundations
nationwide. We looked at and got some of
their contributor lists, and it appears, who was
funding them -- nothing but Fortune 500, the

very big oil companies were primarilyfunders _

to the Mountain States Legal Foundation. We
became very interested in the Mountain States
Legal Foundation and decided to find out
what else they were protesting in addition to
the ERA Extension.

 

‘Let's not split hairs, Senator. We both know that big
government and private enterprise worship at the
same church.’

THE GUARDIAN / cpf

One of the biggest targets was I
Affirmative Action. They kept on saying
Affirmative Action was "reverse
discrimination." As a matter of fact, it was
these legal foundations that invented that
word and kept on hitting it again and again.
We believed then and believe now that the
right-wing front is to protect business interests
that want cheap labor pools of both Blacks and
women and that there is tremendous
connection. - ' ’

And that connection is not only to groups
that take us on and then take on other issues,
but also there are attacks on such issues as pay
equity. Note-that Schlafly is constantly
attacking pay equity, constantly, but she isinot
the only one doing it. One of the things you
must do when analyzing the right wing is read
what they write in their publications, then
read what public officials are saying and what
is in editorials, and you will start seeing the
same catch words again and again.

One thing that the opposition and the
right wing want you to believe about pay
equity and comparable worth is that it is an
attack on the traditional family, and that the
feminists are trying to get at the blue-collared
man. It’s a divide and conquer strategy. In

Page 110 ’.

-pay equity and comparable worth.

other words, what they want the public to

believe is that we have no appreciation for the

blue-collared worker (by the way, they never 
mention the pink-collared worker, that would}
be beyond them), but we are the_professional 
women trying to get ours, and we are taking it?
out on the traditional family: the'so—ca1led A‘
blue-collar man who has a traditional 
housewife to support. What we’re trying to do;

is knock his pay lower. That is the assertion. 

But why was that strategy invented? . 
One of the most beautiful things is that a

memo was leaked to the Washington Post. The  if

memo, dated May 14, was, to Donald Devine, 

Director of the Office-of Personnel 

Management, from James Burns, Deputy
Director of Office for Staffing. He wrote:

"The political possibilities ,
of this situation, the situation
o_f comparable worth, should not
be understated. By doing job
evaluation across clerical -and
blue-collar occupations, a
comparable worth study would
immediately divide the
white-collared and blue-collared
unions. The blue-collared craft

' unions would especially be ,
concerned, since they would be , -
the inevitable losers in such a '
comparable worth adjustment
process. Moreover, the unions
would be pitted against the
radical feminist groups and
would further divide this
constituency of the left.

Rather than allowing
[Representative Mary Rose]
Okar’s comparable-worth bill to
manipulate the administration
on the gender issue, we could
create disorder within the _
Democratic house, pitting union
against union and both against
the radical feminist groups."

Now that is, in my opinion, one ofthe 7
strategies that they have always been about,
and that is to divide and conquer what they
consider the constituencies of the progressive
side. So on comparable worth, they are trying
to court men with lower-paying.jobs and
trying to say that we, in the professional
groups, don’t care about anybody else.
Incidentally, the unions got hold of this memo '
and immediately announced their support for

‘ But it is the divide-and-conquer strategy

that I want to flag to you. That are constantly
doing this. I believe that one of the major.
reasons for the abortion issue is that it is "a
divide-and-conquer strategy to try to divide

V off from the progressive side the Catholic

blue-collar vote. That is the bottom line of
their strategy. I have believed it from the
beginning...

And I believe that the old right, the new
right, they are the same crowd using the same
tactics, the divide—and-conquer tactics to
attract people who would not buy their

. economic policies because they are against

them. They can’t say, "I’ve got such a deal for
you -,- it’s for tobacco interests and oil
interests and every major interest." They
can’t sell that, so they scare them to death.

"And say, "You know you don’t like the

nigger-lovers, and you don’t like the pe'ople
who are going to kill babies." OK, that’s what

You must know your opposition: They

._And that is how the homosexual gay
lesbian issue fits into it. They play to bigotry
to get the Archie Bunkers of the world but the

v purpose is to cover up their economic agenda
' and we should never, ever forget that.

And‘ so we never should be surprised by
the ERA/gay/AIDS connection brochure of
Phyllis Schlafly. That is typical of the politics
of the right wing as they try to whip up
emotional issues, fear issues-, as they depress

_ the support of economic policies that would be

beneficial to most people...

On NOW’s Current Strategy,  I 
- in This Light
I believe that the Vermont ERA

campaign gives us an opportunity to figure out I

how to get out a vote, not depending on- ~ _
Republicans and Democrats for a progressive
This would be, I think, an
inexpensive campaign. Vermont is a small
state, $200,000 to $300,000 could do a very ,  
good media campaign and a "get out the vote" 
campaign. I What I would like us to do is to I
develop a package,’which we could then roll
out to other states.

Now this doesn’t just help ERA. It helps
referendums on gay rights. It helps
referendums on abortion, because the skills or
tactics learned there would have a use in all
three issues, especially since the opposition
blitzes the public on ERA with ads that are
homophobic and ads that are anti-abortion.

We have to develop a package that makes those
issues positives for us.

There is no question we cannot ignore
their challenge on these issues. We cannot
allow them to continue to say, "The
ERA/AIDS connection" and pretend they have
not said it. We have to deal with it... We
cannot act like we do not understand what is
going on. I believe that when we make those
connections, and when we study the right
wing, we are only going to makeour mission
easier, our message more compelling, and our
duty and our world mission much more
viable.

I feel that the real strength of our-
movement is knowledge and understanding,
and you mustgspread it every inch of the way.
My feeling is that to know the right wing and
what it is about is to understand in more depth
each of our issues, how they are intertwined,
and what the fabric of feminism is. The
feminist movement is on the front lines with
the right wing because we mess up their
economic policies. V

  HMIKE BIBICHEAND Y()iUNGsTOWN..OHIO

By Teresa Anderson’

a, ‘ Minneapolis, MN

for Charissa, one of tlzefaithful

. I . He liked it best.in the morning before

-« traffic and when his wife was still asleep -- 6
a'a.m. on a clear day in June when you could

see the mists rising off the river and from his
bedroom window the smokestacks of the
mills. He’d picture them the way they were
before when everything was running at full
tilt and he’d be coming off thenight shift,
walking up the long hill home, just getting
there in time to see the kids waking up, Helen
already downstairs; he could see her now the
way she used to look, sitting at the kitchen
table, the baby in the highchair. He still

. thinks of her with black hair, and sometimes

" _ 5 now when he really looks at her,’ he remembers
' ' suddenly the soft, pious face of his

‘ mother-in-law at their wedding nearly 33

V years ago. The way it was then when the

town was still important to people, big men
who make decisions. He used to think he was

"‘made_for this life -- broad-shouldered and
‘taller than most guys -- it was in his blood

after all. 2 His grandfather had found his way

- here from what is now Czechoslovakia and

-had stayed to raise sons and grandsons for the
mills. To Mike the mills and he and his

V" brothers were like one complete galaxy set in

orbit rotating around this particular
neighborhood in this brawny steel city in the

- valley of the Cuyahoga.

When he got back from Korea, the first.
-thing he saw from the train were church
‘domes and then his part of the city, "Little
'-Russia," set up high overlooking that

- sprawling forest of stacks. Every street

looked just the way ‘he’d remembered and that

, A : was when he felt ready for everything -- a

wife and kids and the work. For three
‘decades he’d felt good about making steel,
being part of it. Even. on summer nights when
the heat scared the hair on the back of his ,
hands, and he could feel the furnace lickingat
his eyeballs, he felt inside himself like a man
who knew whatlhe was about. Making what

. ‘was’ needed for ships, bridges, planes and sleek

cars that glided over the roads that linked his

‘town with places like New York City, San

 

./'

  

Francisco and L.A., He was a member, afiteir7.all,_‘ '  ;

of that last generation of Americans who" 

n f 4
,,:»~,‘ ‘J

2 “\‘\;3<5=¥~‘~'>‘ __

believed in-the righteous beneficence of:_their»i.fv "A S

country.

‘ In fall the hills around Youngstownwere’
the best escape. When he was young,-heloved
the challenge of tracking deer and the crazy
camaraderie of the guys. But now a longing
like hunger comes over him in late October
when he remembers getting his sons ready for 3
their first trip, the look in their eyes, thedeepl
and quiet joy of teaching. Summer fishing /I -
trips were good for the same thing -- sitting on
the banks of fast-moving Pennsylvania rivers,

“listening to the boys splashing around in the

shallows, wrestling with bass and trout. He
never wanted to travel much more than 100
miles from home. Everything a man needed

_was encompassed by these rivers and hills.

Mike Bibichi was not a restless man.

Why is it that a man who believed in
himself and his nation sits today, 30 years
after the end of the Korean War, on the front '
stoop of his house and talks to no one. He

keeps with him at all waking hours a six-pack

and his caged parakeets. He assumes his post
whenever spring first comes, certainly by
Easter most years, and he watches over the
neighborhood. The church where he was

“baptized and married, from which his parents

were buried, is just across the street, but now
that it’s abandoned and boarded up, he
watches over the copper dome and the old
wooden doors. Sometimes visitors and a few
tourists come to take pictures or gawk at the
dome, to admire the three-pronged brass
crosses or the symmetry, of this, the oldest
Russian church in the area, built by his
grandfather and the men of that generation.
Nobody talked about why it was closed, but it
all seemed to happen at once about six years
ago -- the layoffs and then U.S. Steel closing
for good and the kids all taking off for towns
like Phoenix or Houston or Oklahoma City,

places where Mike knew no one, flat cities laid

out on a grid, where most people had to drive
for miles and miles to get to work and

‘ everybody wanted to live in apartment V. 3
W complexes and condos way off by themselves.

Helen kept at him in little ways about it --

moving to the sun belt where they’d be closer
I .

l

to the grandkids and it would ‘be warm all ag° 14

year. He never took it out on her, though,

’ never hung around the bars or wandered

around just "killing time." He wondered
about_that expression "killing time." Why
would any man in his right mind want to do
that?

Mike made the mistake of trying to talk »
to Helen about it, just once right after he got
laid off.

"You can’t just keep living in the past,

pretending like some idiot in D.C. or New

York or someplace hasn’t just named this
whole area ‘the rust bowl.’ What in the hell is
thatsupposed to mean? Look at me. You see
any rot on me? I keep _looking for something
wrong with me, everyday in the mirror, but I
don’t feel any different. What are they tryin’
to do, turn this place into a leper colony?"

Just then he looked up from his beer mug
where he’d been staring into the foam.
Helen's face wasn’t what he needed to look at,
not with the fear he saw on it. He felt like if
he looked too closely into her eyes, the panic
there would fill up the whole house and

become part of him. There’s only so much
room for fear inside a man at any one time,
and Mike had reached his limit. He1en’s fear . T,’
wasn’t the same as his, and he didn’t want to 
know about it. So he concentrated on the _beer',.ff
again and then looked out the kitchen windowﬁ}
and the ragged elm in the backyard. 

3%

"The way I figure_it, we’ve got to do A‘,
somethin’ to show people, especially the J ‘__,;i
assholes whoclosed down the mills even afterili
we offered -- hell, we practically begged to be if”
allowed to take big pay cuts and run ’em by . 
ourselves. Why was that such a stupid idea? 
We know everything about runriin’ the mills; 
What else have we been doin’ for a hundred. W
years? Why not let us have a crack at it? i '33
Nobody else wanted ’em. But the company i’
didn’t care and as usual nobody listened, so
now Youngstown is at the center of the ‘rust

bowl.’ Jesus Christ, Helen, I don’t know what", ‘

we’re supposed to do!"

He didn’t look up this time, justlbolted
upstairs to get his gear ready for bowling and
stayed out late enough that night to make sure‘:
she’d be asleep. ' 

Now Mike never talks to anybody about 

WHATSHOULD WE DO

it.'_ Silence has become for him a way of

 ‘fighting back. Helen has her dream, living in
 _the past, and he‘ has his duties. By day‘ he
 guards the church.

"I will not speak of Thy mystery to Thine

f, enemies." A

At night sometimes he dreams about the

I _ icon of the Archangel Michael.

"You know, Michael, this is your special ,
icon. The Archangel has your very .own
name."

He must have been three and a half when
his mother pointed that out to him, one winter
evening just before Vespers when the church
shined like the inside of a purple jewel. As a

boy he had longed for a sword_as large as the. 

holy Archange'l’s, one with points of light

'_ striking it the way they did when candles were

lit. before the iconostasis. But in the dream
his mother disappears and the icon has been
abandoned in a bombed-out church -- one like
the pictures from Russia his oldest brother,

‘ . Peter, had brought back from World War II. A

church with its dome blasted off where the
rain has destroyed all the f rescos and all the
other icons have been taken except for this
huge Archangel whose fiery eyes watch
soldiers file by, exhausted and shattered faces
that stare straight in front of each step, men
who have lost too much to care about what

‘ looks like just another casualty-, another ruin

on the long road home.

Mike feels like he’s the only one left who
car _e‘_s. Two brothers working in Texas, onein
Jersey and two others who spend most days
working on their cars or riding around in a
pickup looking for odd jobs, repairs, light
carpentry work. Mikefigures he’s the one
who’s supposed to guard that church and the
little -piece of the world he loves likehis life.
There isn’t another place he could breathe
right and he trusts these streets and the houses
built 75 to 100 years ago. '

So Helen explains to relatives and

' neighbors that Mike needs to sit outside alone

on the stoop with his birds; it seems to calm
him and after all, he was never a man to talk
much, a dedicated and quiet man, the best

. worker in the world, and he never lost his
‘faith, So she doesn't worry as much about

him now that she understands. Mike Bibich
has made for himself a vocation, and he will
endure.

THE TCULTURASL WORKER

By Susan Doro
Milwaukee, WI

The poem waited for her outside the

. wheel shop door. Wa-ited, as if it were one of

the leaning train wheels stacked against each
other, like round brown five hundred pound
dominoes. Train wheels waiting to be hauled

‘ inside the factory, machined to order, then

mounted on shiny steel axles and rolled out the
door into the Menomonee Valley train yard.

So too, the poem waited. It had been J
waiting for her to finish work since 3:30 that
afternoon. Now it was midnight. Soon she
would step out of second shift into the dark of
the going home night.

Hours ago in_the early evening, the
summer sun hung low and rosy over old
freight cars in the yard. The poem had gone
to the window nearest the machine the woman
was operating that night. The poem thought
that the sunset would surely get her
attention. But not tonight. She was
measuring a train axle with a micrometer,
straining on her tip toes to reach around its
diameter. The poem could see she was too
busy to be thinking poem words, so it did what
it knew how to do.

It waited. Measuring minutes against the
sun's shadows on the dirty cream colored brick
wall. It waited, as 5 o’clock break time came.
It waited and watched through a different
window as the woman ate half of her
sandwich sitting at the lunch table by the
men's locker room, sharing a newspaper and '
talking with some of the guys. She was the
only woman in the shop. There usedto be two
others but they got laid off. Now she was the
only one of her kind left, and sometimes she
was lonely. But-tonight the poem saw that she
was having a good time, joking with her
"buddies."

It was an hour and a half later when the
poem looked in again. The woman was
standing with the micrometer in her hand,
listening to a short elderly man with gray
brown whiskers. He wore a work worn green
hard hat, low over his eyes. His hands
glistened with dark brown dirty train bearing

grease. In one, he held a red handled putty 
scraper. In the other, by their,cuffs, a pair 
oily rubber gloves. The ring finger was ’ "

missing on that/hand. A cigarette bobbed up ,

and down from his mouth as he talked. Its_

ashes dusting the man’s°brown shirt every so .73

often. The poem could catch only a few of.

the man’s words... "wife... divorce... still love% I
her..._ the kids don’t..." The woman was intent
"on listening to the man. The. poem went back‘;

to wait at the door until dinner break.

In summer it was still light at 8 in the ,7

evening, and the poem knew that the woman

would come outside to sit on ‘the long bench -9 
against the building. Most of the men would  -‘ ,
go out for dinner to the tavern up the hill, so  '

she would usually be alone. Sometimes she

would take a walk by the railroad tracks, I  ,

 

heading under the freeway. There was a river? . 4

to watch and listen to, and wild flowers to" I .5?‘
pick. In the early spring, there were little ‘

green onions and asparagus hidden" in the
grasses. Sometimes she would read or write 

her journal. But tonight she had no pad of _
paper, no pencil or pen. She was sitting on the
bench, but she was leaning forward a bit, " 
holding a book. A union agreement. And she?‘

was not alone.‘ She and some other workers 

were talking words like "lost jobs...

bankruptcy... lay off beginning in July... the  '

company can't... illegal... they’ll try... four],

guys fired..." The poem saw it was useless to 

try to get into her head. Then the factory
whistle blew and a foreman appeared in the
doorway, motioning the woman and the men
back to work. v

';:.'.§
!»

The poem stayed outside.

At 10 o’clock the poem went to look in
the window by the woman again. She was _
staring out into the blackness of the night, but?
she didn’t noticethe poem. Her eyes were _
taking in the silhouettes of axles and wheels
and oil drums._ Watching black birds fly i_n
front of the huge pink street lights on tall A
poles that illuminated the train yard. Her
face was feeling a goodwest wind blowing _
in. She wasn’tthinking poem thoughts. She. '

was thinking of going home and wishing the a
night would hurry so she could get there. "A
fewmore axles," is what shewas thinking, as

 she turned ‘away from the warm starry night.
 A night smelling of Menomonee Valley city

3 wilderness, and NOT the stockyards, thanks to
1' thewest wind. Away fromthe window she _,
i turned. Away fromthe poem looking in the

. window, and back to her job. A

And finally it was midnight.‘ The moon
wasghigh over the factory roof. The yard was
a water colored wash of moonlight and pink

' from the lights in the valley. The moon was a
‘ white ball with a golden ring. The poem

waited with the moon, holding its breath. The
pink lights shown down over the top of the
building, casting shadows on the path next to
the tracks.

The womanwould be the firstready to
leave. Usually she waited for the guys by the

‘little gray door at the far end of the shop. But

tonight she had told them she was in a hurry.
She stepped alone into the night as the _
midnight whistle blew. She was short, but her
shadow was.ten feet tall. She carried a paper
sack of dirty work clothes in her arms. The
poem was with her like her shadow, walking
quickly. The farther away from the building,
the taller her shadow grew, from the pink
lights and the moon on her shoulders. Little

. rocks and pebbles at her feet crunched under

her shoes. Each pebble had its own shadow,

‘like pink moon rocks -under her feet. She
smiled to herself, enjoying the moment‘-.

A cat meowed, and scampered under a
parked freight car. Night birds called. Now
‘her shadow split in two, growing taller, taller,
taller. Catching pink lights on more poles in
the train yard. She stepped carefully across
one, two, three sets of tracks. Past stacks of
unmachined train axles and rows of wheels.
Past lines of mounted wheels and axles
waiting to be shipped out. A lone black bird
cawed at her from a telephone’ wire.
Something stirredin her brain. Some
disjointed words seemed to come together.
She laughed aloud, and the crow cawed again,
leaving its perch to fly over ‘her head into the
blackness beyond the realm of pink lights.
Then suddenly the woman threw her head .
back and yelled up into the pink and black
sky. "HEY... I'm a midnight rider. A cat’s eye
glider. I’m a second shift lady goin’ home!"

' She laughed again. And surprised and

sPagei75"

delighted, the poem jumped INSIDSI-3 HER  A

a fetus kicking in the ninth month, She‘ ‘_ _
hurried along, faster now, al-most running the
last few yards past the guard shanty.

She wasat her car in the parking lot
now. She unlocked its -door, opened it and
flung her sack of dirty clothes in the back
seat. Getting in, she started the car up and
aimed it out of the lot, waving to other .
workers that were now ‘crossing the tracks
behind her. Finally she would have time for
herself. She felt the uneasy urgency she’d had‘
all night, go from her in a deep _earth moving
sigh, as she drove past the guard shanty and
turned up the road to the rampleading from

_ thevalley.

And a poem was born, comfortable as a
well fitting work shoe, andsatisfying as the
end of the work day. The poem. The
woman. Themachinist. All became one.
And she sang to the hum of her car:

I’m a midnight rider
A cat’s eye glider
V I'm a second shift woman goin’ home

I’m a moon rock walker
A night bird stalker
I’m a short tall shadow headin’ home

. Six-thirty somehow comes two hours
earlier on a Monday morning. Roll over -
shake some life back into the left arm - I hope
there's enough hot water for a shower.

Lately, I don’t usually rook in the mirror
before my teeth are brushed and my face is
washed - seems like my face wakes up half an
hour after the rest of me. Good grief, who is
this person with the gray hairs in small clumps
now? My mother loves to point them out to
me. Thanks a heap. I should start naming
them, like the craters on the moon. '

V‘ All right - stop daydreaming. Time is so
structured, so scheduled 1 I have only so much
timein the morning before work and I have
tons of shit to attend to. Wake up the kid. A
Once she asked me why she has to go to sleep
at night when she’s wide awake and has to
wake up when she’s so sleepy. Wise guy. Get.

minutes. Do you have lunch money? Did you
brush your teeth? Do you have all your

love you.

Now I have twenty minutes before I have
to be out the door. I should have ironed my
clothes last night - too damned tired - lucky I
washed the dishes and put away most of the
laundry - still didn't write that letter - too bad
- not enough time any more for anything - no,
not enough time left for a quiet breakfast.

I was so thrilled when I bought this new
car. I spend a lot of time driving around
during the working day. I almost didn’t care
what kind of car I bought, as long as it had a
cassette player. Nice to hear my music. I
Sometimes I just play the same tape over and
over - Bob Marley, Eddy Grant, Rahsaan
Roland Kirk (...bright moments is for all the
very wonderful’ people in the universe that has
never known anything about bright moments
so check it out...)

I hate drivingaround for work in the
winter. My feet get cold from stepping
through the snow in worn out shoes. I resent
cold feet. I can’t find a place to park close to
the building I have to go into. Damn. Walk
two blocks carrying that tool bag. Somehow,
its weight varies - heaviest on a Monday

POEM FOR JENNY,

I never worked with you
but your husband '
runs a machine next door to me

‘ I never spent time alone with you‘

tho we all went out for fish fries
on two different Friday nights

I never worked with you

but I feel as if I know you

through the eyes of a husband

who speaks of you with pride and love -I -V
and years of sharing  ..

I never worked with you _
but I know how it is to go to work
and stand on feet all day

that scream for you to sit down

know how it is to wonder

if the kids will be all right
when they get home from schoo
and you’re not there A

how t_o birth five babies

in this crazy worlldg

and give them all of yourself
wishing it could be more

wishing you were more
wishing,you could_be
in at least two places
at the same time

I never worked with you

‘ but I know the sister worker feelings

we both share
know we’re strong and proud
and have a right to be

and Jenny, I know you

   Boys  I Me

By Sue Wrbican
Pittsburgh, PA

When myyounger brothers and I were -
growing up, our usual question to Dad around

j Christmas time was "whaddya want for

/

Christmas?"

His typical response was on the order of
"a hug from your mother" or for "Susan finally
tog ‘Ian A in Math." I was left both confused
‘and essured by his odd gift prerogatives
when ﬂlere existed a sparkling selection of ‘
ties, books, tools and other fatherly presents.

. I'd grab the Sears Catalogue and say,
"Look at this nice tie, Dad." He’d reply, "Get
me a better one at the Goodwill for a/
quarter." ‘ ‘

As Dad inculcated such practical wisdom
into my independent conscience over the ’
years, I became increasingly capable of sorting
out the bull that walks and the money that
talks. Through our frequent conflicts we
learned the two sides to every coin.

Unfortunately, I find myself sadly
missing my antagonistic mentor this
Christmas. He died of cancer in October.

Since his death,‘a fleet of submerged
questions began surfacing. Did I really not
believe inVCadillacs? Was,I going to take his
spot in the batting order of life? Or was ‘
Daddy's only and oldest girl going to fade in
the heat of a scorched outfield in a man’s
world?

Recently, training to be a cable TV
technician, I found myself to be the lone
woman in an intimate class of 12. Our teacher
had created a highly competitive atmosphere.

During the infant stages of the program
we dared not yet let our personalities come out
in an attempt to stay hard-boiled with the
competition. But daily involvement with one
another lightened ourthearts.

One student, however, refused to offer
anything of himself at all except during
breaks, when he reveled in proclaiming that he
was "God" and that we were his lucky disciples.

Naturally, this routine grew old . V
quickly. This student began to address me as{
"baby," as in "Hey, baby." Only when] had it
scored an amazing one-or two points above R"
"God" on three consecutive tests did the_"Hey_, -V _
-baby" remarks stop. * I I ‘

One sweltering afternoon when the _
teacher was gone and "God" was spouting "his.
usual routine, some of the classmates, frazzled
from his continued manipulation of our ’
leisure time", began cracking on his jive. He _ ‘
did not respond to this banter until I chimed. V
in. -

He spun around and thrashed me with:
belittling wrath. Puﬁctuating with his finger‘
a grave warning that I was never to cross his 7
path again. Here was a six-foot, 200-pound," .
raging madman’in my face. A ' - '

To compose myself, I took a split second-. 1
time out to skim the right and wrong lessons '_ 
learned with my father. I responded with:'th'e 
best reply I could muster. "You have no right‘ 
to talk to me that way and I’m going to do -‘ i I 
something about this." . * i ' -

    
  
  
 

Later, I went to the teacher and , _
explained the situation. The instructor f I I W
reprimanded "God" at the end of the-week, and”,
no violent outbursts followed. My faithin  ' ’
half of the human race had been restored’;

I’m now attending a cabinet-making
class, which is more laid back and contains a_
diverse cross-section of people, ranging from; I
unemployed ‘steel workers with a lot of mouths
to feed to mild-mannered cab drivers with too
few fares to pick up. I carry into this new
situation an accumulation of experience '
dealing with different men as co-workers and
have found I can practically tell by lookingin
their eyes who will give me trouble and who
will accept me. ' “

A /

Big Benny tended to look away from me
when we made eye contact. I knew it would
take a little extra effort onrmy part to
befriend this seemingly hard-core ex-Marine.

\ .

But, as it turned out, the problem was not
Benny. It was that shifty dude ‘named Orville
next to me on the lathe. I went over to start a

g

 "project on the smaller lathe and noticed that
 , :, he had hoarded all of the good tools off to the
~ side. ~ -

I When I reached myhand out to pick one
 of the chisels he refused to let me have it.

- . Upon my questioning his "ownership" of the
shop’s tools, he told me that he had sharpened
them and I couldn't use them until he was

I finished with his project. "Well, I'll only be a

_ minute," I said. I picked up a chisel and went
back to my lathe to do what I had to do. When
 returned the chisel and picked up another,
Orville seethed, "I said no, Sue." '

/

A I don’t react well tohcommands. "The
shop’s» tools are to be shared, Orvil1e," I said,
' trying to control my rage. He snatched the
chisel from my hand and said harshly, "Wait
. until I’m finished."

I informed Henry, our perplexed teacher,
who looked at me and then back at Orville. He
shook his head in disbelief and started back to
the lathe where Orville was hunched over his
« work like a dog over a bowl o!f'Alpo.

_ The next thing I knew Orville had
thrown his" face mask against the wall and

stormed out ‘of the shop, declaring he wasn’t.

"going to take any crap off that girl." '

_ I felt awful at first, but as days went by I
 ‘ - started feeling proud that I had stuck up for

 ~ my side of the coin. A woman shoul‘dn’t back
» down from these situations.

Now when I think of right and wrong,
truth and lies, and what the underlying
meaning in life is all about, I see the only
thing that can’t be bargained is yourself.

T It was a pleasure to have an article
(Sunset):published in the Spring 1985 issueiof
The Mill Hunk Herald. There was a typing
error (sorry) that is best corrected: Lucy F-usco
paid four thousand dollars for that house she

I  bought in Swissvale in 1940, not $40,000. Forty
thousand dollars in 1940 would have bought a
“-mansion!

‘ t, It is a year since my first v_isit to Lucy

,' Fusco, an Italian-American widow of a

Westinghouse employee, residing in a high-rise
for senior citizens in Swissvale, Pa. Time is

4 accelerating its ravages on my subject: meager

eating and exercise has resulted in loss of _
weight and muscle. Her flesh is loose about
her limbs; her skin is pallid. Her eyes are

dimming to near blindness under the thick
lenses, of her glasses, andher hearing loss is
profound. The intention when doing the oral
~ history was to show that Lucy is becoming

T isolated within the very heart of the

’. community where she lived and served for

V - "over sixty years.

The air in the small apartment is stuffy; a
window is seldom open. There is a stale scent

A i from a fading, potted plant; the dead blossoms

have fallen about the assortment of Easter and
Mother's Day cards standing on the small,

- round table. Some of the snapshots of great ~

grandchildren that had been placed
haphazardly along the frame of a wall picture
have begun to fold and fall to. the floor. The
glass of the sliding door to thelittle outside
balcony is dusty and smeared. V
Lucy is pretty much at the mercy of

humanity now. The former daily visitors no
longer come. The daughter in Illinois, no
longer" young herself, is able to visit maybe
every other month. The closer, married son
has had to take a second job, but he still stops
_ every week day to check on his mother’s
stability, and to bring basic groceries. This
son is bitter that his mother will not consent to
go to live with his sister, and that the sister
does not take some forceful action to get her
there.

:§T;1/

The apartment is unkempt and no hot
food is prepared except occasionally, when an
acquaintance who had once been close tothe
family surrenders to a gnawing little guilt
feeling, knowing the old woman is solitary,

and decides to pay a visit. The visitor.might 
do a load of laundry in the building’s facility,

make up the bed, clean up the disarray and
spillages_in the kitchen, and -prepare a single
warm dish.

Lucy may be hallucinating. She claims
that a couple of womenwho live in the 0
building had a duplicate made of her door key
that she had oncepermitted them to hold.
Their having a key to the place had meant that
Lucy did not have to struggle with her walker
to answer their knocks. She had wanted their

‘company, but their nightly visits began to

stretch far past her bedtime, and she finally
told them not to come for the late television
programs in color, which they liked to view,
and to return her key. So they stopped their
friendly visits altogether. \

Lucy says these women are cruel and
threatening; in her mind she has -exaggerated
their faults. She believes they steal into the

- apartment at night with the replica key, raid

the refrigerator, turn on the television and sit
on her bed and glare at her while she is trying
to‘ sleep. She is afraid to go to sleep, she
confesses. She had her son ask the manager of
the high-rise if a new lock might be placed on
her door, but he was told if such a concession
were made for his mother, all the tenants
would be demanding unreasonable privileges.

A trip to a doctor might solve some of
Lucy's problems. A doctor could determine
how much of her suffering is real and how
much is imagined, and prescribe proper
medication. A concerned "outsider" will have
to hassle with family to get permission totake
measures to improve the old woman’s living
standard, which is approaching subhuman.
Lucy herself is still adamant about remaining
independent: staying in the compact little
apartment that she is so used to now, and
refusing to go to Illinois. The son and daughter
let the days go by, long days during which

~Lucy endures a hard lot: isolation, neglect and

helplessness.

By Susanna Downie
’ Pittsburgh Activist

It is important to realize the extent’ to
which current Ainerican foreign policy is
directly responsible, at least in part, for most
of_the misery that is so prevalent in the "third
world" (i.e., not America, Europe, or the USSR,
and not Japan either, but just about
everywhere else). The case of women
illustrates the point. I was fairly aware of
some of this information when I went to

' Nairobi, and all of my worst suspicions were

confirmed, in great detail, by my talks with
women there and by the literature I picked

up. Information was flowing fast and
furiously the whole ten days, and even with no
background one would have to learn a lot. I
can’t really do anything comprehensive here,

- _ but I would like to give a few examples.

 

 Women of the World, Unit-ingf "

, incursions into Mozambique, blow up tra_ins,,

Similarly with the women from ,
Mozambique, where a socialist government
made similar progressive changes at the level
of legislation and in spite of the extreme
poverty of the country tried to implement p
them as well as they could, even though from
the beginning, they too were being sabotaged 
by their own version of "contras," only in their 
case, the sabotage was and is being carried out

  
  
  
 

American economic and material supportfor
the Nicaraguan contras ‘is greatly exceeded by.
our similar support for South African military
adventures. South African troops make daily‘

roads, bridges, attack peasants in the fields-or
in the villages, burning and slashing as they
go. Women who see their whole society.  , I 
threatened with violent destructiondo not. _..;.
have much time to worry about sexual 

One of the first things I became very

clear about after talking to women from
Nicaragua, Namibia, Mozambique and
Uruguay (and subsequently many others), is
that women in many, if not most, third world
countries have a hard time separating their
situation as women from that of their country
as whole. This was especially true for the two
Nicaraguan women I spoke with. For them,
the revolution has already happened and they
are struggling desperately to preserve the
gains they have made, as women, under the
Sandinistas. One of the first things the
Sandinistas did when they took over was pass
a lot of legislation equalizing and improving
women’s lives. They made all children
legitimate (no bastardly laws), they mandated
state supplied child care for working mothers,
they equalized laws pertaining to employment, \
they created stiff punishments for
pornographic uses of images of women,
including using women’s bodies to sell soap
and everything else. And they instituted
literacy for everyone, with special provisions
for adult women whose family responsibilities
made it difficult to take time to go to school.
So for.Nicaraguan women, saving the
Sandinista regime is the same as saving the
gains they made when the Sandinistas came to
power. And the bloodshed and economic
damage done by the Contras makes every day
a struggle, and enormously complicates the

Namibia presents an entirely different
picture. Namibia is legally under the
administration of the UN, but has been
occupied by South Africa since 1917, when the
Germans pulled out and it became a
protectorate of the League of Nations, still

. named South West Africa. When the UN ,
inherited it in 1946, the beginnings of national

' ' liberation movements had emerged and the .
UN was sympathetic to them, and asked the

South African government in various ways to
begin to turn the government over to the
people. South Africa refused to get out, made

' ’ .some sham promises -of reform, but basically

went on steadily instituting apartheid.’
Meanwhile, with fairly consistent support
from the UN’, the people continued their
struggle, were recognized as Namibia in the
early 70’s, and SWAPO (South West Africa
People’s Organization) is recognized by the
UN as the legitimate representative of the
people of the country, which is even more

' disproportionately black than South Africa.

But the mineral wealth of the country is not
going to be given up voluntarily by the whites
(Namibia is rich in uranium, diamonds and
zinc). And with so much outside support for
the indigenous people, South African powers
feeleven more threatened than they do in
South Africa. So Namibians are subject to
daily police terror - disappearances, torture,
no legal rights at all, they can be arrested
anytime for any reason and held indefinitely,
they have no rights to health care or
education. The situation forythem is even
worse than for blacks in South Africa (hard to
imagine, but true). So women from‘ Namibia
simply have no interest in anything but
getting rid of the hated South African

' Many of the women in Nairobi trying to
inform others about the situation in their
countries were actually living‘ in exile. I met '
several South African black women who were
living in exile in Lesotho. They said‘the_re
were at least 40 others like them who had come
to Nairobi - from other parts of*Africa,' where‘
they lived in exile, unable to go back to their ,
homeland becausethey would be killed if they _ :‘
did.

There were quite a few Iranian women,
dressed in Western style, who were living in
exile in places like Sweden or France, and who
gave a very different picture of life for
women under Khomeini than did the women ;i
in chadors who were representing the Iranian 
government at the UN conference, and who 
were obviously picked becauseof their 5|
remarkable enthusiasm for singing the praises
of life under Khomeini. The exiled Iranian
women, as well as women from Pakistan and
Bangladesh, were unequivocal about the
negative effects of Mcslem rule for women.
Rape is common in these countries, but if a
woman wants to prosecute a case against the
rapist, she must have four malewitnesses "of
good character‘-' to testify for her, and her
testimony is legally defined as worth half that
of a man. It is common for women trying to.
prosecute for rape to be instead convicted of
adultery and punished, usually with public i!
flogging. 
Everywhere in the world, where ' 5;
illiteracy is high for men, it is even higher 9:

80°/o of women are illiterate, whereas only 40% (ii

people alike demanded that something be

done. Business blamed high wages, and

a government agreed that in order to. get prices

down, wages would have to be cut. In 1980
when Reagan got into office, he told us in. his

I finest patriotic rhetoric, that we would all

have to make sacrifices to get inflation under
control’. -Fine. But we were wrong- What
Reagan really meant was that some of us
would have to make ALL the sacrifices, whil

In the beginning, businesses began
demanding, and in some cases got, huge
concessions from the unions. Little by little,
those that held out saw their jobs evaporate.

more concessions, and those trying to hold

that the price of what they bought would drop

No! Then where have all these concessions

religion is the state religion, and is the basis

essentially slaves, subject to the whims of men,
and defined solely in relation to men.

Generally, worldwide, high illiteracy,
poverty, malnutrition, and low life expectancy
go together, and wherever men are suffering
in these ways, women are suffering even
more. And until these extremely basic
societal problems are addressed and solved,
women will not be in any position to see or
work on problems that are special to them.
Since the poverty of most of the third world is
organized by multinational corporate interests
(which are not subject to any higher law),
enforced by military dictatorships and backed
by United States military assistance, the least
we can do is educate ourselves about these
conditions and work to make our government
more sensitive and responsible in its policies

TO CHANGE THE WORLD

Page 29

By Mary Wilson Sage
Pittsburgh, PA

Ruether, Rosemary Radford. To Change -_

I the World. New York: Crossroad, 1981.

"Can a male savior save women?" The V  
‘question heads Ruether’s chapter on ‘  ‘
Christology and Feminism. This small volume
is a collection of lectures, first delivered at the
Free University of Amsterdam in 1980. In
them, Ruether addresses political activism,
liberation theology, ecology, Jewish~Christian
relations and feminism. -

It is the work of no small mind. .
Rosemary Radford Ruether is Professor of

I — Applied Theology at Garrett-Evangelical

Theological Seminary and concomitantly on
the faculty of Northwestern University, an
acclaimed scholar, author of several books and
many articles.

The answer to her question is a
resounding "Yes." "Together," she says, "Jesus
and the Syro-Phonecian woman, the widow
and the prostitute, notgas male and female
principles, but as persons responding '
authentically to each other, point us to that
new humanity of the futpre. It is these
females from outcast groups whom Jesus
identified as accepted. ’

Ruether’s has been a very personal
struggle to discover an "inclusive theology,"

‘ one which’ can speak to women as to men.

Thomas Aquinas, the author tells us, defined
male as the "generic" sex, as did Augustine. As
late as 1976, the Vatican pronounced "physical
resemblance" to Jesus as anessential
p_re-requisite for priesthood, thereby
rea_ffirming opposition to ordination of
women.

The struggle is, by no means, exclusively

. Catholic. In recent years, debate within

Protestantism has heated to boiling over the
same issue, in some instances rending
congregations.

Given this history, how can informed,
intelligent women fail to be radicalized? Yet
Ruether comes through solidly with Jesus and
with the Christian church when it stands with
the poor, the needy, the oppressed.

Liberation is the encompassing theme,
and liberation, she saysis possible "only ‘
through a profound repentanceéof the church,"
a recognition of our responsibility to the 
oppressed of this world, and our action to

i move society toward "the Shalom of God,"

toward this "new humanity."

Hank stood up and put his hands high in
the air. "Then just like that--a shining light
poured over me and was a-l-l around, and I
saw the Glory of the Lord a-l-l shining! It was
a miracle, and I could‘ see and hear."

Thelma sat very still, watching Hank and
looking like she might collapse if he continued
his inspired testimonial much longer. But
Thelma always looked like that, and if you
knew her well, you would have seen that she
was paying more attention to Hank’s
performance than she had paid to anyone
except her psychiatrist for years.

"What did you see?" she asked, smiling.

"I saw Sister Ida and my mother standing
next to me, but I didn’t know it was them! I I
didn’t know what my own mother looked like
until I was eighteen years old. And I couldn’t
walk or talk, but they taught me at the
hospital a little bit at a time, like a helpless

‘ little baby. That's what I was like.‘ But I

learned good, so they let me out, and here I am

Thelma stopped smiling and made herself

think for a minute. "I used to be a Methodist," ‘ if ’

she said. Hank was pleased and impressed by
how clearly and well Thelma spoke her words,
but not reassured by "Methodist."

"Do you believe in Jesus Christ our '

Thelma had passed the test,

Hank was a leader, agoof y, generous,

bewildered, half-starved refugee or crying for 

hours because her mother had died while she .
was in the hospital. Thelma needed to be.

it was a good match.

After months of faithfulcourtship and
being adjusted to the community, Hank and
Thelma gathered up their soap, shampoo and
toothpaste samples, their plastic razors and the

I booklets on birth control and the four basic

foo‘d’g oups, which they had been given to

packed their clothes into Hank’s '_ i .

. j"wHosE "NEQMORT" IS IT Al\lYWAY?i

By Betsy Angell

\

The handsome, graying man appears on

"the TV screen. His voice is well-modulated,
= reasonable, convincing. "Do you know," he

asks, "how many lives have already been saved
He doesn't answer the
question. He goes on: "Have you and your

- T loved ones talked about what you would do in

the event of an unthinkable accident?

A . Participate in someone else’s future. Sign an

organ donor card today." The words vary, but
the message is the same: organs are wanted
(needed?). . . '

The conditioning has been subtle. The

- media have done their jobs. Even the lay

public knows that no one "dies" today; they
"arrest." We have readily taken into our
vocabulary such terms as "cardiac arrest," and
"brain dead." It is not a far step to the
language of the 21st century which is almost
upon us?‘ "Neomort" and "bioemporium" are
but two of the terms.

"Neomort" is simply the body of
someone’s loved one, stored in the health care
industry’sorgan bank. It can be maintained
now, its tissues oxygenated mechanically, for

an indefinite period in a "bioemporium."

Coma was ndt some science fantasy
pulled from the facile imagination of an
uninformed nobody. Robin Cook is a
physician and he has read the reports of our
medical future planners. The words
"neomort" and "bioemporium" come from the
Hastings Center, a Massachusetts-based
medical think tank.

It is unnecessary to consider the plot of
Cook’s story. The facts upon which it is based

’ aresufficiently sobering to suggest serious

questions which need to be confronted.
Medical science and technology have spa‘wne
more than one monster. ~.

You thought, perhaps, that your life, and
your death, were your own, that you had the
right to choose in regard to your loved ones.
Think again. Take your time. The health
care industry will wait, in itslown way.

_ \ ‘.\. l  I .._‘,
Consider this scenario: Amy, your 15 year . '_ A

old, is in an accident on the highway. She-is
airlifted from the accident scene to the local
Emergency Room. It is midnight. You are
notified that Amy has severe headinjuries
and you give verbal consent for treatment.
The Emergency Room staff goes into action.

It may have done so already, in anticipation of
your consent. Who will say "No" with the

limited data which can be communicated in as 5 ‘-

hurried phone conversation?

1' While youmake your way, with faint’

heart, to the hospital, the staff is installinga  1

ventilator, placing monitors, regulating
intravenous flow, injecting drugs in an

unstinting effort to stabilize the patient and  '_i_'

maintain "life." A ‘

When you arrive, you are given a few
minutes in the treatment room. Amy is
attached to a wondrous array of tubes"and

wires. The IV drips, the monitor beeps,

H marking the rhythm of mechanical life. Amy C‘

lies unconscious, her mascara staining her
pale, puffy and seemingly lifeless face. Aside
from a broken leg, her injuries are cranial.
Still, you hope. What parent doesn’t?

The doctor tells you that they would like '
to transport Amy to an urban medical center
where,th’ey are equipped "to deal more‘ 7
effectively with these cases," and you agree.

Will you ask for a definition of "these cases" or‘,  1»

what it means to treat them "more _
effectively?" You are informed that a
neurosurgeon can examine her in the

morning. In your distraught state, you miss
that "in the morning." If there are severe head

‘ injuries and it is appropriate to have Amy

evaluated by a neurosurgeon, does it not stand . I

to r_ea’son,_that the sooner that assessment is
made, the sooner measures can be taken to”
limit the damage?

While you drive to the urban hospital, the A

helicopter delivers Amy. S/he lies in Emergency
Room #2 for some time and is then transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit. Why’? To "observe
her," "do what we can" until the neurosurgeon
can see her.

Certainly you will not be told that the
brain wave was flat while Amy was still in ER

#1, requiring the darkeningof the monitor
screen while you visited her. But how many
hours will pass before you are told that there
is "nothing more we can do," that Amy is
dead? How long will it be before it seems
appropriate to ‘tender the delicate request for
your permission to remove Amy’s healthy
"young organs for transplant?

Meanwhile, who will pay the cost of two
ai_rlifts, two emergency rooms and an intensive
care unit, in addition to physicians’ costs?

’ How long will itbe before that cost shows in

all our insurance premiums? Has it already
begun? Suppose you deny consent? Your
insurance company will still be billed.

Is this not one of the "monsters" of
advanced technology? This question joins a

‘air You see we_'2e susv wrru -n-us t-IuMANrrAem~\ uvet femspmurgi

host of others. Whose organs will be requested
and who will receive the transplanted '
organs? It won't be your unemployed brother
on public assistance. Who will make that
determination? Who will decide what
"quality of life" is worthy of preservation?
How many must die throughout the world
while research and experimentation attempt to
give an extended life to the affluent few? Do
you have the right to die, or to refuse
treatment, for yourself or for a loved one?
Will that donor card in your billfold relieve
you of that right, making it illegal for the
attending staff to discontinue treatment?

I, for one, have_removed and destroyed
my donor card and made another contribution
to world hunger.

 like to climb one of those ropes of light

swing around the giant

between presses, welders, assembly lines

past the man working the overhead crane

everyone looking up, swearing off booze, pills,
whatever they think made them see me.

I’d shed my boots, coveralls, safety glasses, ear plugs.
and fly out the plant gate '

past the guard post

and into the last hour of twilight.

Factory Jungle *

Right after the seven o'clock break

the ropes start shining down, I
thin light through the factory windows,
the sun on its way to the time clock.

 

My veins fill with welding f|ux——

I get that itchy feeling I don’t belong here.

I stand behind the biggest press in the plant _
waiting for the parts to drop down into the rack,
thinking about what that mad elephant

could do to a hand.

but I don’t care.

The parts, are backing up

I rip open my coveralls and pound my chest
trying to raise my voice

above the roar of the machines
yelling louder than Tarzan ever had to.

"‘,.

Jim» Daniels. "in his ﬁrst book of
poems, draws upon his experiences
in living and working in his native
Detroit to present a stark, realistic
picture of urban blue-collar life. Dan-
iels, his brothers, his father, and his
grandfather have all worked in the
auto _industry. and that background
seeps into nearly all these poems.

‘ /

“Jim Daniels’ tough Motown narra-
tives are stark urban creations. He
has an infallible ear for the words
that come from our stricken indus-
trial cities.” '
—Paul Zimmer

“Jim Daniels’ work is strong, direct,

with a contemporary validity.”
—Gwendolyn Brooks

, “These poems are both testimony

and the articulate gift of its human

A emotion: that one lives in a world

that can feel, and insists on it. . . .Jim
Daniels is a poet of unique commit- .'
ment and ability. He makes poetry an
act of deep caring and recognition."
—Robert Creeley

“These poems‘ are a refreshment.
They hiss and steam with the street’s
vibrant hardness, the effort to look
around the corner, pain in the eyes
after a long day’s work.”

—Carolyn Forché

“This is gritty writing. It needs to be
read again and again to let your pre-
conceived notions of America change
beneath the abrasion of these poems,
that is, if you are inclined to seek the
truth: Detroit at work in the car fac-
tories, and out of work, and at lei-
sure and play and in self contempla-
tion: grease, dirt, and self disgust,
from which we get our handsome,
dashing cars. What could be more
characteristic of American life than
this irony. The book says it all.”
-—David lgnatow

“Jim Daniels is very good. whether
he is shoplifting. scraping up dead
carrots, or making love to a machine.
There is subtle art in his simple
poems. He keeps the technique, and
much of the suffering, tohimself. It is
a joy reading him.” ‘
—Gerald Stern

  

Jim Daniels was born in Detroit in
I956 and currently lives in Pitts-
burgh. He is a recipient of a I985

Creative Writing Fellowship. This
book is the recipient of the inaugural

TENDING To TRUTH

A friend recently introduced me to the
Mill Hunk Herald. After a thorough reading, I
f ound‘ myself eagerly in favor of the Mill
Hunk’s tendency to allow the truth to surface
in’ the corporate lagoon of lies and '
treacheries. Hence, my contribution of two

-i .. -apoems as well as my most heartfelt and

believable support.

, I thank you for your valuable time and
efforts. ‘

HUNK NOT JUNK

I receive all kinds of-junk in the mail and
it requires real discipline to wade through it.
Not so with your journal. I have really '
enjoyed reading it and I haven’t finished yet.
But I've read enough to know that it is
well-conceived and a nicely put together piece
and I'd love to subscribe.

I’m a construction electrician in the IBEW
and I teach labor history to members of my
union at the Labor College here in N.Y. I plan
to use some of your stuff in class.

On the way to my last session I read the
MHH. I laughed out loud on the bus --

' something I am not usually prone to do. It got

me fired up to teach. Thanks for the spark!

Genuinely meaningful work is hard to
come by and you all have clearly found some.
Carry on! '

Best wishes,

1 3 V RESEARCHER WRITES

I am a labor historian studying
deindustrialization of steel, silk, hatting,
machine tools and more in New Jersey in the
20th century and last summer I spent time in
Pittsburgh. I met an unemployed steelworker
and recently subscribed to the Mill Hunk
Herald for both him and myself. He’s written
a poem (below) that I would like to see you ‘
publish, if possible. Like most people
devastated by corporate greed, he doesn't
think that anyone is listening to his voice.

But the dignity and anguish of his words come
through clearly to me - I know he’ll never send
it to you himself. ‘

Please keep up your hard work because it '

helps so many, whether or not they tell you ,
how they feel. _In solidarity from your sisters .
and brothers in New Jersey and Pittsburgh,

CULTURAL KUDOS

So glad a magazine like this exists. I
write a lot about work, and there are so few
places and people I can share it with beside the
wonderful folks I work with.

Please keep up the fine political cultural
work. It is especially desperately needed in
this horrible time of reaganomics.

As Meridel Le Sueur says "Survival is a
form of Resistance."

By Savina, A. Roxas ’
Pittsburgh, PA

Teresa Franco sat at a black Singer

I sewing machine in the Lewison Blouse Factory

on 14th Street, herblond braids wrapped
around her head. She kept her mind on the
factory where she worked and not on
Domenico and the inevitable wedding. As she
worked, she pretended the wedding day would
never come. She wore a gray slim dress under
her long white apron that had a dark edge
where it met the floor and her high-buttoned
black shoes. Though she was not as tall nor as
buxom as the other women who worked there,
she matched their output. « She had the energy
and stamina of the Italian mountain'people
she had come from who farmed in the open all
day, the.pure air and water sustaining them no
matter what they ate.

‘On each side of her the women worked.

" stoop shouldered, their heads close to the
» fabric they guided under the needle as it sped

along. Teresa held herself erect as she guided
the fabric, pumping the treadle with feet that
danced in double time to the rhythm of the
needle, herear tuned to a fast. tarantella and‘
her thoughts to seeds dropping into a furrow.

It was spring planting time in Acadia, she
thought, and her days would have been spent
in that air so clear and pure that she had to be
tethered to keep earth bound. How she
resented the long hours in this stuffy loft.
Her face had a look of serenity that was
interrupted only by a chin thatjutted forward
to precede her when she became angry. Her
almost oval face with fine features from her
father's side of the family, had deep blue eyes
fringed with thick blonde eyelashes that gave
her a look of perpetual summer. ‘By contrast
she had dark brows that set off a fair skin few
women in her part of Italy possessed.

It was quitting time she knew from the
ache in her lower back and the warmth of the
late afternoon sun streaming down on her
through the tall dirty windows. Any minute,
the insistent whistle would blow and she’d be
outdoors where she could breathe freely

I again. The lint and dust from the fabrics and

the odor of too many sweating bodies made the

hair insufferable.‘ Teresa recalledhow she had

opened the window near her the first day she
worked there. The foreman came down the

' aisle screaming, "Who opened that window?‘ , . -"

It’s against the rules. H_ow can you sew a
straight- seam with the wind blowing the
fabrics around?" Around her the women 
continued workingasiif they hea,rd.nothing‘.‘— 3

They were already behind schedule he

ranted. That day he scared her, but as time . , 
w.ent on she became accustomed to his picking vi "
on any reason to be abusive. It was his job to-_ A 
get as much work out of them as he could and V it ’

keeping them cowed was one of his-

, techniques. »

The whistle blew. The loft filled with" A “:3”

the sound of scraping chairs pushed away
from the machines and the hum of voices.
Teresa stood up and removed her apron, 

draped it over her chair. As she stretched h,ﬁ‘r_ H‘  I
back, Stella grabbed her arm and they‘ headed V

for the crowded elevator. As the youngest .

operators in the loft, they stuck together. V On 

the way down, the elevator resounded with
hacking coughs. Teresa felt sorry for the

older women. ‘Sophie, oneof the older ones,  
‘called out, "While you’re still young, find I _ , ’
' yourselves a rich American husband or you’ll » 

get to look like us."

"Sophie says the same thing every night_,'-I‘ ‘. ‘

Stella said‘,’as she caught up with Teresa after ,
they separated from the others. ' ‘T "

.‘ .'

"She means well," Teresa said. '

"You’re lucky to be leaving soo_n,"_.St‘elIa .:.
reminded her. I A “

"I could never work through the summer
in there," Teresa said._ "How do you do it?"

"It was bad last summer. The women
fainted left and right," Stella said, closing her
eyes as if in a faint.

"Did they send them home?" Teresa
asked.

"No. Just gave them a whiff of.s elling

them back to work," Stella responded/her
anger clearly showing.

ii "That foreman’s a devil. He’s always
pushing formore work. I’d love to fix his
wagon," Teresa said, her chin beginning to
jut. .

Stella laughed, "You certainly knew how

. to put him in his place."

"Don’t remind me," Teresa said.

They parted on 28th Street where Stella
continued to walk up town and Teresa walked
cross town to Second Avenue. Walking along,
her thought went back to the day her father s
first brought her to the blouse factory. She
had just arrived from Italy. Mr. Lewison, a
friend of her father’s, agreed to give her a
jo_b. It had been an exciting morning when
her father walked her down Broadway into
the skyscraper for her first elevator ride. She
was confounded by the noise on the tenth
floor loft. Hundreds of sewing machines
whirled away with solemn faced operators

_ who never looked up.

Tony, the foreman, had come forward to
greet them. In a voice so loud even the
machines didn't down it out, he said, "Mr.
Lewison told me to take good care of your
daughter, Mr. Franco." Her father left and

Tony directed her to a vacant machine where

he demonstrated what-she was to do. Her job

was to sew the seams in the blouses. The
button holes, finishingruffles and buttons
would be done by others. When he was
satisfied that she knew what to do, he asked,
"Did you bring an apron?" ‘ 4

She answered, "No," and wondered if
she’dever get used to the noise. Tomorrow,
she’d bring ear muffs as well as an apron, she
thought.

"I’ll lend you an old one for today," he ,
said as he pinched her cheek. "How can I keep
my mind on my work if you're not covered
up. You women are all the same."

Teresa had sat at her machine and for a
minute, looked around the loft at the sea of
green lamp shades that spotlighted each
machine and outlined countless women
stooped over their work like extensions of
their machines. For the first time in her life
she had felt anonymous. Uneasyat first, she V
found, as she became accustomed to it. that she
liked the liberating feeling of not knowing
anyone around her. But all too soon, she
recalled, she had become known to everyone.
She smiled to herself. The day she had won
the week’s cash prize of one dollar for the
operator who completed the most work, Tony-
had presented her with the prize. "Good
work, Teresa," he said. He pinched her
bottom and smiled. She smiled back at him.
With a vengeance she returned his pinch
holding it until he screamed, "Basta, basta."
Later in the day, the younger women cu me to

with excitement.

She continued her walk homeafraid to
savor the thought that tomorrow would be her
last day of work. Marriage to Domenico
would be no better. As she approached her
house she saw her mother in her usual place on-
the porch waiting for her. This would end,
too, she thought.

The next morning, Teresa said to her
mother, "I need a glass of wine before I
leave."

"What's wrong? Since when do we drink
wine for breakfast?" her mother asked. She
searched her daughter’s face for the answer. _

Mysteriously, Teresa said, "I need lots of
courage today."

"You must be sick," her mother said. She
reached out to feel Teresa’s forehead.

"I think I know how to get the windows to
stay open at the factory," she said, her chin
coming forward. '

"You got into trouble the_last time you
opened the window," her mother reminded

. her.

With a frown, Teresa replied, "There may
be trouble again."

"Remember, Mr. Lewison did your father
a favorvby letting you work. It's your last

day. Behave yourself," she said, and made the
sign of the cross.

"Mama, don’t worry. It'll work out,"
Teresa said. She kissed her mother goodbye
and left.

Into the April morning she stepped, the
wine giving her a heightened perception of
what had to be done to win the battle. The
forsythia, yellow and profuse, was in full
bloom in every yard she passed. The church
bells were ringing for seven o’clock mass and
the sound of horses on the pavement filled her
She joined the rush of
people walking down town and felt confident
about what lay ahead.

On the elevator going up, she told the
women her plan and asked them to spread the
word to the other women as they came in.
Tony did not come in until a quarter of eight.

The women assembled at.seven thirty so there
was timeto open all the windows. If Tony»
closed them when he came in, they ‘were to
stand at their machines, say nothing, but not
work until the windows remained open. "He
can’t fire us," she—told_them. "Hehasa big

rush order and he’ll be. firedif he doesn’t meet

the deadline. Where could he find trained"
operators to replace us?" When’ they stepped
off the elevator, the air was already ’
offensive.’ - v

Tony came in, the women were seated at
their machines working. "What is this?" he
screamed. "Who opened the windows? The

them up." As he talked he went around the
loft closing the windows, the women stood _
up. Tony’s mouth fell open when the whirl of
machines stopped. In a rage‘ he threatened,
"You’ll all be fired. Get to work." When the a
women just stood there not responding to his

threat, he threw up his hands and said, "I~guess-

if the work doesn’t fall behind, the windows;
can stay open."

Teresa thought to herself, he’s just a big ‘I
mouth full of hot air. All they had to do was

stand up to him, and he backed down. After -

all, what choice ‘did he have.

Teresa was the first to sit down and the -
others followed, filling the loft with the
familiar sound of machines again. Tony, his

face looking grim, collected the work as it was I

completed and for once did not scream to‘ spur
them on. By the middle of the afternoon,
Tony and his runners seemed to be enjoying _
the fresh air, as they went up and down the
aisles collecting and counting the output. The
women exchanged winks with each otherias
the men went by. By the end of the day Tony
announced the production was not slowed
down, windows couldbe left opened.

The thrill of the women’s victory brought
tears to Teresa’s eyes. "Long live fresh air,"
the women shouted as they crowded around
her. The confrontation was over, Teresa’s
chin no longer jutted forward. Stella grabbed
her arm and they headed for the elevator.
Downstairs, Sophie. said, "Never mind rich
husbands. What we need are more women like
Teresa." Everyone laughed.

As they walked up Broadway, Stella said,
"I’m going to miss you. Work won't be the
same without you." '

if Old Right, New Right, Still Wrong

' By Eleanor Cutri Smeal

We’re just beginning here today, and I
think we are about to make some new history.

 I, Ichose this topic because I feel’ that in these
V times, to gear a strategy that is adequate, one

must know the opposition and one must know
it quite well. And I feel very strongly that_we
can learn from the past as we plan for the
future. But we cannot learn if we don’t know
that past, both of ourselves and ofour
opposition... - -

- The lobbying [for ERA in Indiana in
1977] was interesting to me, but it was really

I 7“ puzzling. The most puzzling part was that
5 there were all these people from the opposition

that we had not seen when we were out in the

. field. -But these people were supposed to be
.  ‘normal middle-class Americans. And we were
supposed to bethe militants.

“ Now one problem is that I had been too

' much an average American and been too much
- j a part of it. I looked at these kids,and at the

time, ‘I had youngsters myself that were pretty

- j young. I looked at these kids, and the boys

had on blue suits and white shirts and blue

 f " ties.

And I looked at these little boysiand said,

- "I don’t know how they get them in these
. clothes." You could not get Todd in an outfit ‘
 like this to save your life.

Andthen I looked at the little girls, and

/  they were so froufrou. They werelike out of
_ a caricature. They even had Mary Jane shoes
 on; no sneakers or anything like that;

Healthtexv was out, and in was frills and little

,‘ blue suits.

I kept looking at these kids and kept

 saying, "Where do they come "from? I mean,
 where do they get these kids? Is there central
 . casting someplace?" So I asked everybody,

"Where are these kids being bused in from?"
They were little toddlers, 5 year olds, 6 year

The parents also looked like a throwback
to, I d‘on’t.know, maybe the 40’s. I couldn’t
, figure out where the clothes came from. So I
. asked everybody. I kept being obnoxious,,I

. from‘a.recent razpeech to the S. Hills NOW

kept saying "Where are these people coming '
from?" And they would say, "These are
churchgoing good people." And I said, "They
might be, but they haven’t discovered
Hcalthtex. They don’t know anything about
wash-and-wear. Where are they staying?"

wE‘RE cHRas‘nANS,
REMEMBER? THE

So anyway to make‘ a long story short, a
senator pulled me aside and said, "Look Ellie,
you have asked everybody this question.
Don’t you know who these people are?"

I said, "No, I really don’t."

He said, "They’re all from two
fundamentalist churches, and they alwa ys
come up, they bring them up for everything.
They are supposed to be America. Last week
they were up here lobbying against a
child-beating bill." And I said, "Against a
child-beating bill." .

He said, "This is big in the right wing.
Don’t you know child-beating bills are
Communistic?" And remember this is early
1977. I didn’t know that child-beating bills"
were Communistic. I thought they were great
for kids that were having problems.

Anyway he said that they were there. He

 said, "And you might think that they’re

religious. I don’t want you to get confused on
that." He said, "I don’t want to insult you, but
how long has it been since you have been in
church?" A

Now I had to give him my background,
and actually I’m raised a Roman Catholic, and

every time'I go home for a funeral or wedding‘

 I mean I’ve been there a lot. And I said, "I

don’t see people like this."
