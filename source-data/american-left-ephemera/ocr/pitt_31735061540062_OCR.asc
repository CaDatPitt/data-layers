AN INDOCHINA PEACE CAMPAIGN REPORT

The fate of the political prisoners in the jails of the
Saigon government has is a major issue of conten-
tion in the implementation of the Ceasefire Agree-
ment. The Agreement states:

The question of the return of Vietnamese civilian
personnel captured and detained in South Vietnam
will be resolved by the two South Vietnamese par-
ties . . . within ninety days after the cease-fire
comes into effect. (Article 6).

One of the things that makes this a major problem
is the large number of political prisoners held by
Thieu. Estimates are as high as 200-—300,000.
These estimates are based, in part, on the rate of

arrest in South Vietnam, which was 14,000 civil-
ians per month since April, 1972 and rising (Time
magazine, July 10, 1972). The Far Eastern Eco-
nomic Review reported that 50,000 people had
been arrested throughout South Vietnam during
the first two months of the Spring offensive (July
18, 1972). Over four years ago, irj, July, 1968, the
Saigon Daily News reported that there were over
100,000 political prisoners in Saigon’s jails.

Who are these prisoners? Why were they jailed?
Will they be released?

who is critical of his regime: According to two
French schoolteachers who had been arrested by
the Thieu government in 1970 and held in various
prisons until December, 1972, the jails hold all
kinds of people who. in any way opposed Thieu,
worked for peace, or spoke out against corruption:

Chi Hoa [Prison] is like South Vietnamese society in mini-
ature. There is everything from former presidential candi-
dates, Buddhist monks, women and children who have
‘never committed any offense, to the most hardened crim-
inals and drug addicts. There are countless children in
_South Vietnam's prisons. Often a mother is arrested too
quickly to find anyone to care for her children, so the
children are arrested and imprisoned, too.” (Press Con-
ference, January 2, 7973. I

Thieu has always sought to jail his political op-
ponents. Right after the presidential election of
1967, Thieu jailed the runner-up in the election,
Truong Dinh Dzu for inciting ”neutralism.” Dzu is
still in prison. Since then, most of those who have
been in any way outspoken in their criticism of his
government have been arrested. On November 11,
1972, Thieu’s nephew Hoang Duc Nha, claimed

 

that the Saigon government arrested 50,000 poli-
tical opponents and killed 5000 (CBS Evening
News). The Saigon Ministry of Information report-
ed that the police made 7200 raids against political
critics between November 8 and 15, 1972.

THlEU'S LAWS

Under laws decreed by Thieu over the past several
years, citizens can be arrested for a wide variety of
reasons and held without trial for long periods of
time: Most of the decrees are aimed at what Thieu
calls "pro—communist neutralism” whereby neutral-
ism is equated with pro-communism.

The Washington Post reported on January 18,

1973 that "President Thieu has given his province
chiefs a wide latitude to make political arrests after
the coming cease-fire and has also empowered
them to ‘shoot troublemakers’ on the spot." To
handle the new arrests Thieu has begun a crash
program to increase his police force from its pres-
ent level of 122,000 to 300,000 (Le Monde, Sep-
tember 8, 1972). U.S. government officials con-
firmed, in an interview before the Ceasefire Agree-
ment was signed, that ”Thieu has ordered the ar-
rest and ‘neutralization’ of thousands of people in
the event that cease-fire negotiations with Hanoi
are successful . . . The term ‘neutralization’ can
mean anything from covert execution to a brief
period in detention.” (Los Angeles Times, January
1, 1973).
Thieu has not only arrested his non-communist
political opposition, but he does not intend to re-
lease them. Andre Menras, the French school-
teacher recently released from Thieu’s prisons, ex-
plained why in his press conference:

If the Thieu regime is going to have a chance to survive
after a cease-fire, they've got to get rid of everyone who has
lived in his prisons and who could tell what they've experi-
enced, what they've seen in the camps, especially the Cath-
olic students, the Buddhist monks, who refused military
service. Obviously they can't be called ‘Communists,’
they're from well-known Saigon families, well-known to the
upper classes there. It could snowball if they begin to tell
what they've lived through, what they've seen, the tortures
they've undergone. Because of their religion and their social
standing, people will believe them. Thus it is a matter of
survival for the Thieu regime to get rid of these people.
Also there are some prisoners they haven't been able to
break. Even if they've broken their bodies, they've not al-
ways broken their spirit. (January 2, 1973)

TREATMENT OF PRISONERS

The Saigon government has ordered systematic use
of torture as a policy: The two French school-

teachers are not the only people to have witnessed
or spoken out about the treatment given to poli-
tical prisoners in Thieu’s jails. A Saigon judge, Tran
Thuc Linh denounced it publicly:

/ have seen with my own eyes persons fastened to benches,
into whose mouth and nose interrogators poured sewage
water, soapy water and even /atrine water until their stom-
achs swelled to the bursting point . . . l have been eye-
witness to the scene of prisoners with bleeding wounds
half-carrying other prisoners more battered and bloody
than themselves as they emerge from interrogation rooms on
their way to their cells or to court.

THlEU'S PLANS

Despite the provisions in the Ceasefire Agreement,
Thieu has no intention of releasing very many poli-
tical prisoners: He has recently ordered that in the
new wave of arrests, "Those arrested are to be
charged with common crimes instead of political

I

ones,’ so that the prisoners will not fall into the
category of political prisoners whose release is pro-
vided for in the Ceasefire Agreement. (Washington
Post, January 18, 1973). Many political prisoners
were arrested under Decree No. 004/66 by which
Thieu empowered himself to imprison anyone "for
a maximum period of two years, which is renew-
able.” No specific offense concerning political ac-
tivity and no trial are necessary. There have also
been reports that Thieu is beginning to re-classify
some prisoners who were arrested long ago for poli-
tical activity as common criminals (Washington

Post, January 23, 1973).
Already the North Vietnamese and the Provisional

Revolutionary Government have lodged very
strongly worded protests to the International Con-
trol Commission claiming that the lives of these
prisoners are in great danger. Their claims appear
to be at least partially borne out in increasing num-
ber of reports that the Saigon government may be
transporting prisoners out to sea and executing

Ngo Ba Thanh is an internationally known
lawyer who studied in the U.S. at Columbia Uni-
versity. Now she is in prison in South Vietnam, her
health permanently ruined from mistreatment and
denial of medical care. In September, 1971 she was
arrested by Thieu’s police after she had partici-
pated in a demonstration protesting the presi-
dential election where Thieu outlawed or dis-
qualified all candidates except himself. In
recent years she had come to oppose American in-
volvement in Vietnam and the suppression of all
democratic freedoms by the Thieu government.
She organized the Women's Committee to Defend
the Right to Live. She is charged with three
offenses: having engaged in "activities harmful to
the national security,” having organized an "il-
legal organization," and having distributed printed
matter that "undermines the anti-communist
potential of the people." When she appeared be-
fore a military tribune in Saigon in March, 1972,
her condition was haggard and extremely weak.
She collapsed in the arms of her husband (see
photo). The Saigon authorities claim she was
having an asthmatic attack (New York Times,
March 23, 1972). During the first week of Decem-
ber, 1972, Ngo Ba Thanh was forcibly transferred
in the middle of the night to a prison for common
criminals in Bien Hoa. At present, her family does
not know where she is being held and is unable to
take care of her.

them. "Fishermen in the south have noted many

Rai . . . off the western part of South Vietnam."

U.S. GOVERNMENT R ESPONSIBI LITY

The U.S. government has organized, financed,
equipped, and trained the personnel to run Thieu's
programs for getting rid of his political opposition:
The major program by which Thieu's opponents
are killed, arrested and sometimes tortured was
called ”Project Phoenix” and is now called "F-6.”
The Phoenix or F-6 program is largely staffed by
the U.S. Central lntelligence Agency (CIA) and is
directed by 637 U.S. civilian personnel (Hearings
on U.S. Assistance, House Foreign Operations Sub-
committee, July-August, 1971, p. 242). According
to Ambassador Colby, in his testimony before the
House Foreign Operations Subcommittee (July-
August, p. 183) 20,587 South Vietnamese civilians
were killed and 46,695 persons had been im-
prisoned under Phoenix between January, 1968
and May, 1971. Funds for the program came from
American tax dollars — $732 million for this peri-
od according to the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID), Office of Public Safety,
through which much of the money is channeled
(USAID publication, 1969).

The U.S. government also funds and supervises
Thieu's prisons and U.S. corporations have con-

structed many of his prisons. American tax dollars
provide materials and services to the prison system
and pay the salaries of six U.S. Public Safety Ad-
visors on loan from the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Prisons to maintain security and supervise con-
struction and training programs (Hearings, pp.
225-6). When two U.S. Congressmen were shown
the "tiger cages” on Con Son Island where dozens
of prisoners were confined in cells that could bare-
ly accommodate a few, were periodically doused
with lime and fed only small amounts of rice with
no salt or water, U.S. prison advisors first protested
their ignorance of such facilities but later awarded
$400,000 to the RMK/BRJ (Raymond, Morrison,
Knutson/Brown, Root, Jones) American construc-
tion combine to build additional "tiger cages” at
Con Son lsland (Hearings, p. 46).

THE FUTURE
For the future, it appears that the U.S.) will con-
tinue to finance Thieu's police force and F-6 pro-
gram despite the Ceasefire Agreement and that this
will severely jeopardize the peace: U.S. AID has
asked Congress for $18 million and the Defense
Department has asked for roughly twice that much
just to train 20,000 of Thieu's police annually, to
supply arms and ammunition to Thieu's police, and
to pay the salaries of 200 U.S. Public Safety Of-
ficers, assigned as advisors to Thieu's police com-
mand. Since these men are not in the armed forces,
the U.S. government has no plans to remove them.
They are part of the 10,000 civilian advisors that
the U.S. has kept in or sent to South Vietnam since
the Ceasefire (Washington Post, February 2, 1973)

Only American aid, in the form of men and
money, enables Thieu to continue jailing, holding,
torturing and killing political prisoners. Only an
end to American aid will see the beginning of the
end to these practices. lf the aid continues, if
Thieu, with our support, continues these policies,
then the Ceasefire will surely break down. Already
the North Vietnamese and the Provisional Revolu-
tionary government are protesting strongly Thieu's
treatment of the prisoners. The Agreement is very
weak in that all South Vietnamese are to have full
democratic rights; political prisoners are to be re-
leased; there is to be freedom of the press and free
(elections. How can any of this happen if Thieu
continues his policies of jailings?
