work of hand or brain. My life work began when I joined the
I.W.W., Industrial Workers of the World, in 1906, a pioneer in
industrial unions which ﬂashed like a great comet across the

horizon of the American labor movement for nearly two

decades. I returned as an I.W.W. organizer in 1912 to New
England, my birthplace, where the I.W.W. led historical textile
strikes in Lawrence, Lowell, and New Bedford, Massachusetts.
The strikers were unorganized, largely foreign-born men and
women whose wages were cut when their hours were reduced
by Massachusetts law.

MISS FLYNN: In 1913 I was aleader in the Paterson, New
Jersey silk strike; in 1916, in a strike of the iron ore miners on
the Mesaba range in Minnesota, where the mines are owned
by the U.S. Steel trust, I will attempt to prove to you that it
is not the Communists who advocate and use -force and vio-
lence_. I saw it used in all of these labor struggles, not by the
workers but by police, company guards and State militia. I
saw workers clubbed, beaten and shot down. I spoke-

MISS FLYNN: My travels as a Communist speaker have taken

me all over the country. I saw the fruits of a lawless, aggres-y

sive, brutal and ruthless capitalism which garnered proﬁts
for a few at the expense of the many. .

Our country is a rich and beautiful country,‘ fully capable
of producing plenty for all, educating its youth and caring for
its aged. We believe it -could do this under Socialism.

I saw great forests cut down and the denuded land left
with blackened stumps; miles of top soil blown and washed
away, and fertile ﬁelds became like a desert.

I have seen textile workers who wove beautiful woolen
fabrics shivering for lack of warm clothing, and coal miners
living in cold shacks in company towns, and steel towns that
were ‘armed camps. I saw men black-listed, driven from town

8

 

 

to town, forced to change their names because they had dared
to try to organize a union.

We will prove to you that it is no-t the Communists who
have advocated or practiced force and violence but that it is
the employing class which has done both throughout the
history of my life in the American labor movement, like Gen-
eral Sherman Bell who said in Colorado during a miner’s
strike “To Hell with habeas corpus; we’ll give them post-
mortems.” C

We will prove to you -that—

MISS FLYNN: We will prove to you that it is not we who
ﬂaunt the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but that it has
always beendone by the employing’ class. We will prove that
we are ﬁghting here for our constitutional and democratic.
rights, not to advocate force and violence, but to expose and
stop its use against the people.

We will demonstrate that in ﬁghting for our rights, we
believe we are defending the constitutional rights of all
Americans. We believe we are acting as good Americans.

Since six out of eleven of my writings in Political Aﬁairs
listed by the Government deal with what is called defense,
I will prove to you that this has been a part of my life work
since 1907 before there was a Communist Party.

For example, I distributed thousands of copies of a famous
document in the ’2o’s called “Illegal Practices of the Depart-
ment of Justice,” which is not among the Government’s ex-
hibitsof oldtime documents, but which I would gladlyoffer
to the jury. It was signed by twelve of the most prominent
lawyers of that period, including Professors Frankfurter and
Chafee of Harvard and Francis Fisher Kane, who resigned
his post as United States Attorney in Philadelphia in protest
against such proceedings. A

I early engaged in stru-ggles to win free speech on the streets

9

  

and in halls. This early identiﬁcation with civil liberties led
to my becoming a charter member of the American Civil
Liberties Union in 1917, and la-ter the organizer of the Work-
ers Defense Union, a delegate body from unions and fraternal
organizations which furnished legal defense in political and
labor prosecutions. .

We had plenty to do during the infamous 1920 Palmer
Red Raids. We defended Socialists; I defended Socialists-

MISS FLYNN: I worked for seven years in the unsuccessful
struggle to save the lives of Sacco and Vanzetuti. In the Govern-
ment’s list of exhibits is an article I wrote in August, 1947
entitled “Sacco and Vanzetti-—Twenty Years After,” in which
I pointed out the world-wide belief in their innocence.

MISS FLYNN: Now I will show how and why I left the I.W.W.
and joined the Communist Party. This bears directly on the
issue of forcible overthrow of the government that Mr. Lane
spoke to you about this morning. After careful reflection, it
became clear to me thatthe I.W.W. was an anarcho-syndicalist
organiza-tion. The I.W.W. wanted to bring Socialism within
Capitalism and then break through-the shell of Capitalism

 

by the general strike and the seizing and possession of industry. .

Now, it was precisely this position that I rejected.

I came to the conclusion that Socialism could be achieved,
not by one splurge of violence, but by the persistent political
activities of the workers and the people. And so in order to
participate in political activities in the effort to achieve
Socialism, I joined the Communist Party. In doing this, I, got
back into the labor movement and stopped -being what I then
had decided was anarchistic. ‘ '

MISS FLYNN: As to-the origin of the Communist Party, we

10

 

will show here that there developed within the Socialist Party
an organized Left-wing movement until, by 1919, it was the
majority of that party. v

I At the Chicago convention of the Socialist Party a split
occurred. The Left wing, ejected by the police, reorganized as
the Communist Party. The Left wing was the majority of the
old Socialist Party. - ‘

All of my Socialist friends and associates were Left-wingers.
I was in great sympathy with them.

By 1926 I had become convinced that the Communist Party
was the logical inheritor of all the best traditions, history and
struggles of the older Socialist movement and of the I.W.W.,
too. I was ready to join the party and gave an application to
Charles Ruthenberg, then the secretary of the Communist
Party, in 1926. _

I Due to his sudden death a few weeks later during the most

critical period of my own illness, that application was ap— I

parently lost. Anyhow, it was never presented to the Party. I
was ill of heart trouble in Portland, Oregon, at that time.

While there, I was in constant touch with my old friends,
Ella Reeve Bloor and Anita Whitney of California, both Com-
munist leaders.

Naturally, my heart and mind, although I was ill, were
deeply involved in the. current political problems of the peo-
ple, the menace of Fascism in Europe, the great struggles of
the unemployed led by Communists Foster, Amter, Minor,
Dennis and others, and later the new unions which were
present during the New Deal of President Roosevelt.

Miss Whitney bro-ught me a Daily Worker in the fall of
1935 with a speech by George Dimitroff, called “The United
Front Against War and Fascism,” which the Government has
stated it intends offering in evidence. This speech made a deep
impression on me. Vi .

VV e will show the character of Communist work in the strug-

ll

gle against fascism in answer to this clarion call of Dimitroff,
who died in 1949 as premier of his country. We will show
the background of this speech, which is essential in order for
you to understand its meaning and the intent with which I
then joined the Communist Party.

This was the time ofthe rise of fascism, which we will show

seemed very remote to most people in our country in the ’3o’s.

People laughed at Hitler and Mussolini as demagogues and
mountebanks, but it caused great concern to the peoples of
Europe, especially to t=he Communists in those countries
directly affected -or threatened. ,
George Dimitroff was a Bulgarian Communist who had
been in exile in Germany and while there was framed in the
infamous Reichs-tag ﬁre case.
=Jl= =l(< =X= if 9% ii‘ =X= 3% =3!‘

Mrss FLYNN: Dimitroff was freed. He took refuge in the So-
viet Union, where he delivered thisspeech in 1935 at the Con-
gress‘ of the Communist International. It is an eloquent
and dramatic appeal to ﬁght fascism, which he describes as
the most vicious enemy of mankind. It is addressed to- Com-
munists especially and other progressive people elsewhere, to
put aside all immediate partisan or sectarian interests or dif-
ferences or ultimate political aims to unite to stopgfascism. We
will prove that this is what is meant by “united front.” This
policy brought Communists together with‘ all other honest
and patriotic pe-op-le who were determined to save their -coun-
try from the ravages-of fascism. We will show that Hank
Forbes, one of our party organizers who might otherwise be
here as a defendant, lost his life at the Anzio Beachhead in
pursuance of that policy, as did hundreds of American Com-
munists in World I/Var II. C

I resolved when I read this powerful appeal, “Here is where
I belong. As soon as I am well I will again apply to join the
Cornmunist.Party—.” I did so. William Z. Foster, whom I first

12

    

- -~o—«-—~ 44 --.V

met in 1909 in the I.W.W., and Ella Reeve Bloor, whom I knew

_ from the old Socialist Party, presented my application in the

winter of 1936 and 1937. It was accepted and publicly an-
noun-ced in the press. , .

In my extreme youth I had affiliated myself with the non-
political I.W.W.; in my maturity I came back into the working
class political movement of socialism. This may seem a. very
lengthy introduction, but I have tried to draw conclusions
from my biography on the issues in this case. I did not intend
it to be personal, but an explanation of how and why I be-
came a Communist. And I am an example, not an exception.

Now, as to my ofﬁciial positions in the C-ommunist.Party,
which I gladly‘ and proudly acknowledge—they are a matter
of public record: in 1938 I became and am to-day a member
of the National Committee of the Communist Party. The
National Committee was reduced in 1948 to 13.‘ The other
12 members are William Z. Foster, our chairman, who has
been seriously ill for several years, and my «dear comrades,
the 11 Communist leaders convicted under the Smith Act,
which they challenged as unconstitutional; I have also been
chairman of the VVomen’s Committee of the Communist Party
since 1945, which the evidence will show carries on struggle
for equal rights for women in shops, unions, and all organiza-
tions, even including our own party when necessary. ‘

My comrade, Claudia Jones, a defendant here, is the execu-
tive se-cretary. I/Ve have worked together, spoken together,
written, and helped organize women for full equality, both
politically and "economically, for the building of movements
for peace, consumers" councils, parent-teachers’ organizations,
and similar organizations, for the unity of‘ Negro and ‘white
women," and to’ overcome the exploitation of Negro women as
workers, as women, as Negroes. '

[Many articles which ‘both of us have writtenon these sub-
jects are featured in‘ the" Governm'e"nt’s ‘list of *exhibi‘t‘s1."'We

13

  

will demonstrate to you how constructive and beneﬁcial is
the nature of our work among women, inspiring them to
greater self-conﬁ-dence, greater comradeship with one another,
greater participation in public affairs. The evidence will show

further that we ‘have urged the organization of women for

political activity, not only on Election Day, but the year
around, in hearings, delegations, petitions and statements to
all legislative and public bodies on such issues as child care,
‘better sch-ools, better housing, a better standard of living, etc.

We have written of the history of the women’s movement
in our country, where every right we ‘now enjoy has been won
only by organized struggle——the right of women to vote, to
serve on juries, protective la-bor legislation for women work-
ers, m-ot:hers" pensions, an-d so forth.

We ‘have directed our sharpest criticism to the virtual
disfranchisement of the southern Negro women by force
and violence and through the poll tax, discrimination against
women in factories, lack of upbringing, etc.

We have advocated socialism as a system of society best
guaranteeing to women full equal rights in all spheres and
insuring to them the possibility of exercising these rights.

I remind you again that we are not asking you to agree with
us, but will prove to you that we have not been advocating
force and violence, but, rather, a peaceful, happy world.

I have also been chairman of the defense -c-ommittee of the
Party since 1948, when our leaders previously referred to were
arrested. The evidence will show that our duties, my duties,
were _to raise funds necessary for adequate legal defense of our
members who might ‘be arrested under the Smith Act or held
fo-r «deportation under the M-cCarran Act. Individual Com-
munists are not ﬁnancially able to defend themselves. These
duties are ours. Our duties were to publicize the facts in the
case, since newspaper coverage is notoriously inadequate and
invariably prejudiced,‘ to organize mass meetings, arrange

14

 

 

tours for speakers, and generally call for public support for

their defense.

MISS FLYNN: Inaddition, the Government’s list of docu-
ments which they told us they would introduce in this case
or indicated they would introduce in this case, makes clear to
you, will make clear to you, that I am a columnist ofth-e
Daily Worker. This is correct. For 15 years, from 1937 -to date,
I have produced at least two columns a week, besides many
feature articles for the Sunday paper, The Worker. These are
my personal columns and are not submitted to the editorial
staff in advance. Praise or criticism comes from the readers.
Some of my columns and articles are listed by the Government
as Government’s -exhibits, which they intend to introduce.
If they are to prove my official positions in our Party or my
tours around the country or that I spoke in any speciﬁc places
or that I invited people t.o join the Communist Party, the
Government need not waste its time. I do not deny any of
these things. The evidence will show that I asked‘ people to
join it. I believe in the Party to which I belong. It is a legal
Party in my estimation devoted to the best interests of the
people, and I would not belong to it if I would hesitate to
ask any 'honest person to join me. Hundreds di-d so at .my
invitation. I would be glad to make available to the jury at
the appropriate time not just, a few articles carefully culled
for the Government’s purposes, but all of them dealing with
a vast range of subjects.

I will prove to you thereby that there is no advocacy of
force and violence in any one ofthem. '

The Government did not list them for your attention. I
recommend especially that you do read one of their listed
documents if and when it is presented—the eloquent and able
opening remarks of Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the
Communist Party, when he stood here, as I am standing now,
defending himself before another jury. I wrote an introduc-
tion to it. It is called The Case for the Communist, Party.
The Government has indicated that it intends offering it in
evidence, possibly for this reason. I am glad that the Govern-
ment will make it available to you and would be happy to fol-
low congressional example and ask that this speech of Eugene
Dennis be considered an extension of my remarks.

MISS FLYNN: I have handbills, advertisements and press
clippings relative‘ to hundreds of public mass meetings ar-
range-d by the Communist Party at which I and other defend-
ants -have spoken in the past 15 years. We will prove that
nowhere has there been any advocacy of force and violence.
The subject matter of such meetings should interest this jury,
I believe, however, as evidence of our intent. _

Take some at random: “The Struggle Against the Taft-
Hartley Law”—“The Rights of the Negro People”-

MISS FLYNN: I and other defendants ‘have spoken during the
period covered by the indictment and previously on the radio,
especially in political campaigns "in" support of Communist
and other candidates, including Councilmen Cacchione and
Davis, and for -Simon W. Gerson, a defendant present here,
when he was a candidate after Mr. Cacchione’s sudden death.

We will prove toyouthat the Communist Party, U.S.A., is
not, as t=he indictment sets forth, a society, group or assembly
of persons but is a legitimate political party; It has nominated

16

 

 

candidates for all public ofﬁvces, including that of President.

We will prove that defendants here on trial have been
candidates and won substanially high votes—Perry, Gerson,
Begun, Johnson, Weinstone and Weinstock.

I ran with Mr. Benjamin  Davis for Congress-at-large-*in
1942 and we ea-ch received -over 50,000 votes. ‘ "

Our campaign slogan or program for victory was “Not an
idle man. ' ' ’

_“Not an idle machine.

A“Not an idle acre.”

Mr. Gerson received 150,000 votes in Brooklyn in 1948.

One of the defendants in the current Los Angeles Smith
Act trial, a known Communist, Miss Bernadette Doyle, re-
ceived over 600,000 votes for a state-wide Ol'ﬁ'CC as a peace
candidate. ' ' 

Our evidence will prove how the Communist Party operates
politically. We are a party of anew type in that we are not
before the people just to capture their votes. We will prove
that weare politically active the year round.

We have attended public hearings as Communist spokes-
men; for instance, I appeared with Mr. Gers~on"before the

"Senate Judiciary Committee to oppose the appointment of

Tom Clarke to the Supreme Court. .

non-fascist countries in the world "today. ' ' ' ' C
This is the arena where political views belong,‘ in the ‘market-
place of ‘ public discussion, to_ be passed upon solely by" the
electorate of our country.‘ B " _ ’ v
4 The Covernrnent ovbviouslyiintends to ‘make ‘much of the
fact that oc-casionally we ‘spoke’ in 'so"m‘eb0dy"s home to"a

17

selected group of people. In reference to such house gather-
ings—and some were purely social—we will show that these are

some of the reasons:

Sometimes it was because no hall could be rented and in

small one-industry towns, like steel, coal and textiles, people
seen at a Communist meeting by company spies would lose

their jobs and be black-listed, and even the union would not

be able to protect these members.

Sometimes we held them in homes for the convenience of
women who could not attend otherwise. Sometimes it was for
the protection of Negro people, especially in the South and
border state areas, that the speaker goes to them rather than
expecting them to come to the speaker. We will show that
we -consider it our duty as Communists to protect workers,
members and non-members alike, from harassment, loss of jobs,
threats of violence or FBI surveillance, and just because they
come to our meetings. Wherever possible our meetings were
open with the public and the press invited. Sometimes, un-
fortunately, Communists are driven to privacy as protection
against persecution.

Criticism s=hould not be directed to us but at those who
create the repressive conditions which, we will prove, forces
workers to choose between their jobs and their beliefs. We

will prove, and I can assure you, that no member of our party

but what would be happy and willing to publicly declare his
or her membership if the same rights and protection were

If accorded to us as to all others engaged in political activity in

our country.

The Government willalso make much of schools, as Mr.
Lane has already indicated, where Marxism-Leninism was
taught.

I gave le-ctures at certain schools in New York City, Pitts-
burgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland and at a national training
school. My topics were either “History of the Labor Move-

18

 

 

» ment” or “History of the Women’s’ Movement in the U.S.A.”

I have the outlines which I used in these courses which are
analytical and explanatory, and I will, because they are only
brief——I will offer them in evidence in this case. 

A course on the “History of the American Labor Move- _

ment,” delivered at the Jefferson School of New. York, is_pre-
sented here as the overt act of Mr. Louis yWeinstock.

This brings us to the skeleton upon which this case is built
—a strange new type of overt act, suggestive, if I may say so,
of Nazi book-burning. They set forth——.
>X= =l(< >)S Sl‘ >X< =X= >X= =)(= =X=

MISS FLYNN: They set forth, we believe, activities which are
the ordinary every-day acts of all organizations and individuals
who seek to present their views in the marketplace of ideas.

Of 29 overt acts, 11 are articles in the magazine Political
A ﬁairs. "

5 are Daily Worker articles.

45, including mine, are public meetings. -

2 are committee meetings.

2 are classes.

One is leaving a building.

One is mailing letters.

One is writing a pamphlet.

One is becoming a party organizer.

The Government will attempt to clothe, them, too, I pre-

sume, in -the so-called Aesopian language, or, no matter what .

we. said, we really meant its opposite. ,
It is quite a Houdini-like performance to say peace to a
mass meeting of 1o,ooo people and mean war.» ,

‘Mr. Perry and I and our co-defendants will try, in the
evidence we submit as this case progresses, to cut through
the’ maze of what we consider misrepresentations in relation
to Aesopian language, and to make it clear that whatfthat
we say what. we mean and weniean whatwe say,-and that the

19

   

language of Marxism-Leninism is not as mysterious or obscure
as the Government attempts to make it sound.

All sciences, even the law, have their own terminology, but
like a doctor’s prescription, this -does n-ot mean they are dis-
honest or misleading to the general public. Not a single act
of violence is alleged against any one of us. Nor are there
charges that I know of thus far that any of us collectivelyor
individually advocated the forceful overthrow of the United
States Government. s

The science of Marxism-Leninism, which is expounded in
the books in evidence had its origin over a century ago with
two great political thinkers, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.

“In ‘a ‘few words——and there is always a danger of over-simpliﬁ-.

cation" of a scientiﬁc subject, they declared that what happens
to humanity is not a matter of blind fate nor the will of great
men, nor must it be accepted as irrevocable. They said man-
kind can ﬁnd a scientiﬁc explanation for wars, famine, eco-
nomic depression and poverty, and that mankind, especially
the working class, can help to change society, can alter and
direct the course of history, can abolish these evils and institute
a planned social order, based on the well-being of all.

Out of their profound analysis of all human history, and

especially of its present stage known as capitalism, they de-
veloped the system of scientiﬁc socialism which you will hear
clariﬁed by our witnesses.
' Tod'ay=it has become a tremendous subject, too vast for any
one person to fully explain, nor would the time’ allowed’ for a
-"trial permit it. The Government, I believe, will try to do the
impossible, to compress over a century of the development of
‘a’ great social science into the use of a few books and an
inﬁnitesimal part of its application. .

These scientiﬁc tzheories were not ﬁxed and ﬁnal at th
‘death of Marx and Engels who never considered them a dogma.
‘Like-‘all sciences, they" have ‘e'xpanded'and;have been modiﬁed

.20

 

 

by subsequent developments.

Other students and writers took up where -they left off,‘

particularly V. I. Lenin, a giant intellect and a great man who
suffered exile and imprisonment under the Russian Czar.
He returned to his beloved country to lead the workers
and peasants to free themselves from Czarist tyranny and
exploitation. . .
Lenin enriched Marxism by —-his studies, especially his

analyses of new social conditions brought about by the rise

of imperialism and the advent of socialism.
Marxist-Leninist writings today ﬁll thousands of books in

i all known languages and would more than ﬁll this courtroom

from ﬂoor to ceiling. They are studied -by millions of" people
throughout the world, but we will prove to you that these
great beacon lights are not blueprints, are not hard-and-fast
directives but are only a guide, modiﬁed to conform to the

developments of history and to new social conditions. Pro-

grams, immediate programs are their application.

We hold that political theories are not triable in a court of
law under our established American tradition. No jury’s verdict
can decide their merit; only the people can do that.

=)l= i(< it its =ll= =ll= =)l= =ll< =K=

MISS FLYNN: We have believed that under t-he Bill of Rights
we have a right to advocate our views, but since our ideas are
here on trial we feel we have a sacred duty to ourselves and.
to our Party to adequately defend them from any slander or
distortion. _ _ .

We contend that Americans have a right to speak their
minds out on any subject. We Communists have a right. to
defend socialism or the evolution -of the capitalist system and
economy and of the private ownership of the means of life of
all the people. e

We will prove that such a change can and will be achieved,
only when the majority of the American people are ready and

21

   

willing to make it, and that the Communist Party does not
advocate ,force and violence to effect such a change.

We will try to prove to you during this trial the meaning of
working class internationalism, which the Government‘ will
use to bolster up their theory of foreign agent.

Abraham Lincoln said: “The strongest bond of human
sympathy, outside the family relation, should be one uniting
all working people of all nations and tongues, and kindred.”
Both May Day and International Women’s Day, we will prove,
had their origin here in the United States even though they
are now celebrated internationally.

In the spirit of such solidarity I will show that I made three
trips abroad and which, except for visits to Canada, were my
ﬁrst outside the U.S.A. T-he occasions were a Congress of
Women, held in 1945; the 80th birthday of Mar-cel Cachin,
editor of the Communist daily paper of Paris, L’Humcmite, in
1949; and to cover the convention of the French Communist
Party in 1950, where I was received as a fraternal delegate from
our American party and invited‘ to deliver its greetings.

On this last trip I visited London over a weekend, spoke at
a London District Communist Party conference, and visited
the grave of Karl Marx.

You will undoubtedly =hear evidence from the Government
of my ﬁrst trip to Europe. The International Congress of
Women was held in 1945, before the ashes of war were cold.
Women participated from all the Allied countries: The Soviet
Union, England, France, Italy, Hungary and others.

Many had just been released from concentration camps and
prisons: Ravensbrouck, Buchenwald, Auschwitz. We met wo-
men there who had been in the Soviet Army air force, who
had been in charge of railroads, were executives of industry
and reconstruction; women who came from a socialist country.

We met Spanish women in exile, some who came out of
Spain at the risk of their lives. ~

22

 

 

This Congress ‘held in Paris, without heat, with ﬂickering
lights, with sparse food supplies, was dedicated to the estab-
lishment of permanent peace in the world, the welfare of
children, to the rights of women, all so ruthlessly destroyed by
the Nazis. “Never to let it happen again” was their burning
resolve.

Our American delegation was amazed that they were so
fearful that fascism, like the fabled Phoenix, would arise again
from its own ashes.

On our home voyage via an Army transport carrying over
5,000 returning G.I.’s, we found their desire for peace as
eager as that of the European women.

We will provehere that our work on behalf of peace is
identical with the hopes and dreams of men and women all
over the world as well as the whole American people today.

I wrote a series of 28 articles on these trips. The one the
Government has listed is “I Met A Great Leader of France,”
published February 3, 1946, in The Worker and referring to

a member and vice-president of theiFrench Assembly, a leader’.

of the French resistance movement against the Nazis, a French

I Communist leader, Jacques Duclos. You have heard his name

from Mr. Lane. You will hear a great deal about this French
Communistawho -had written an article in a French Commu-

nist magazine Cahiers Du Communisme, in April, 1945. It was

addressed to his French -comrades. We will prove that they
had reconstructed their party officially on its emergence from
underground and were determined not to lose its identity in
the popular United Front which had developed in the days
of the resistance. While cooperating to the fullest for the
reestablishment of the French Republic, they maintained their
independent existence as the Communist Party of France. We
will prove that he used as an» example of the wrong way to
work, the dissolution of the American Communist Party and
the creation of the Communist Political Association, which

23

 

   

he analyzed in detail for the clarification of his French readers
to counteract “certain suggestions for liquidation,” which had
been. circulated there in France. But we will prove that his
article, while it was a sharp criticism of "the American party,
was not a directive nor an order. It stands to reason that such
a characterization of our course as notorious revisionism which

came from an heroic ﬁghter against Nazism, and a Communist"

of worldrenown, caused us to give it our most serious atten-
tion; especially was this so, and we will prove, when it co-
incided with alarming developments within our own country
which convinced us that the capitalist leopard had not
changed its spots during the war, but was ready to resume
class hostilities against American labor unions and our Party.

’We will prove to you that a revaluation of our thinking and
actions had already begun in our party leadership, and even
without the Duclos article, although possibly not quite so
swiftly, we would have reconstituted our Party, which had
existed since 1919, interrupted only by an extremely short
period of the few months of the Communist Political
Association.

We feel that we have a right to call upon the Government
to explain in the course of their accusations why, if the alleged
danger emanating from our work was so clear and present
that the Smith Act was needed in 1940, why wasn’t it used
againstjour leadership until 1948, or against us, the present
defendants, until eleven years after its passage? We will prove
that Socialism was not on t-he agenda of the 1940 American
political campaign, nor in 1944, nor 1948, or even now in 1952,
and, therefore, cannot begthe real causative factor for this
indictment. .  _ A

It was an attempt to cancel the citizenship of a leading Com-

If our Party needed reassurance of its legal rights, we felt
it was -certainly given by this decision. Justice Murphy wrote
‘cheopinion. I will quote to you a portion of it, which to our
Party and to the country generally was understood to have
laid low this false accusation of force and violence once" _and
for) all, and to have reaffirmed our right to advocate our
political views. This also casts light on our intent, which you
must consider. The Supreme Court had before them four ..of
the books produced here.

The quote is as follows:

“A tenable conclusion from the foregoing is that the
Party in 1927 desired to achieve its purpose by peaceful
and democratic means, and as a theoretical matter justi-
fied the use of force and violence only as a method of
preventing an attempted forcible counter-overthrow once .
the Party had obtained control in a peaceful manner, or
as a -methodof last resort to enforce the majority will if
at some indeﬁnite future time because of peculiar circum-
stances constitutional or peaceful channels were no longe
open.” . . _

That is the close of ‘justice Murphy’s quote. We will prove
that our Party has repeatedly endorsed this statement as a
basically correct, though incomplete, statement of our Party’s
policy in the ‘matter of force and violence, and William Z.

Foster, ourchairman, so stated a few years ago before the

Senate Judiciary Committee. * - .

Socialism" nor “the” char'g'e'*of force and " violence, "should right-T

fully bring us before this jury on this indictment. They be-

. cloud the real issues which we ‘believe are to be found pri-

marily in our day-to-day activities which are not peripheral
or fringe activities as the Government contends, but the
heart of our work. To ﬁght against fascist tendencies in our
country and to ﬁght for peace is to us Marxism and Leninism
in action. « 
We believethat the struggle for peace and democratic rights
will very soon lead to a new political alignment in our coun-

try, which we believe will break through the pattern of the

two-party system and establish a new people’s party, a coali-
tion which we would support.

We will prove that what is called capitalism has existed only
a comparatively short time in the United States, less than two
centuries, and it is not identical with government. It is neither
the ﬁrst nor the last stage of human society. Only those who
proﬁt by it consider it the Alpha and Omega, the best of all
possible conclusions. '

Before capitalism there was feudalisrn, when the feudal
lords owned the land and lived on t-he labor of their serfs.

Before that there was chattel slavery, barbarism.

Capitalism developed and supplanted feudalism. VVith the
advent of power-operated mass production machinery, it ex-
panded rapidly, controlled by an ever smaller group as free
competition was replaced 'by monopoly.

When we speak of abolishing capitalism, wedo not mean of
course to ‘abolish the rich natural resources-of our country,
nor the vast productive industries which have been developed
by the labor of itsp-eople. We will prove that we mean abolish-
ing the private ownership of the basic means of production
and the proﬁt-making system it en-genders, which permits a
few, the capitalistic class, to exploit the many.

We mean that the natural resources, andthe mines, mills,
factories, railroads, means of communication, shall be owned

26

 

 

in common by all the people as state property to be adminis-
tered by a government representing the w-orking class, as well
as all other people. . 

We don’t mean that personal or private property is
abolished in those things which are the result of saving or
for personal use. What will 'be abolished is the use of private
property to exploit the labor of another. For example, in a
socialistic society the prin-ciple applied would be from each,
according to his ability to each according to his work, which
is identical with what St. Paul said to the Thessalonians, that
if any would not work, neither should he eat.

In a Communist society, as differentiated from a socialistic
society, when an abundance of everything needed for human
life, development and comfort is assure-d, the principle would
then be from each according to his ability, to each according
to his needs. ‘

This will be Communism, tzhe fulﬁllment, we believe, of an
ideal human society, which we believe to be possible and de-
sira'ble.

In answer as to how we expect socialism will be brought
about, in contradistincion to the theory of force and violence,
we will prove, as I have said, it cannot be the result of our
efforts alone but it can be the result of the action of the
majority of the people of the United States when they are
ready and willing to make such a change.

We will show that we sincerely denounce in our constitu-

tion “any group or party which conspires or.a-cts to subvert,
undermine, weaken or. overthrow any or all institutions of
American democracy through which the majority of the Amer-
ican people can maintain their right to determine» their des-
tinies.” » ~ . «

States where an entrenched capitalist minority might use-force
to thwart the will of the people who voted for and are ready

to make the transition to socialism, this would be tyranny,

if and we would take the position that the people would be

justiﬁed to use force to overthrow it, just like our own Govern-
ment called uponthe people of Nazi Germany and fascist
Italy to overthrow the rule of terror against the people and
aid the underground resistance movement in all fascist;_oc-
cupied countries. The Communist position is that those who
favored slavocracy opposed the abolition of human slavery
in the past; it is quite possible that a diehard capitalist minor-
ity might oppose the abolition of the capitalist proﬁt system
in the future. Here, as in England and elsewhere,—we Com-
munists strive for a peaceful road to- Socialism. We will show
that we would do everything in our power to prevent the use
of force and violence in establishing Socialism, which we know
full well cannot be undertaken here or elsewhere unless it
has the support of the majority of the people. But we cannot,
of course, guarantee that the enemies of the people will accept
the decision of the people to move to Socialism. Socialism,
however, is not yet on the order of the day, let me repeat,
in the United States. The im-mediate political program of our
Party, we will prove, is anti-war and anti-fascist, for a people’s
front government, a government dedicated to assure the well-
being of the people. What will take place after that along the

road to Socialism in the United States of America is something.

which -history and the American people will determine_, but
which no -one can %here blueprint. This brings me now to my
concluding remarks. ' -

' We are here before you as defendants in this Smith’ Act
case." We will pr-oveto you that we are not conspirators, but
that we are animated and united by common ideals and aspira-
tions, with courage to affirm our beliefs, faith in the people
and the future, and a willingness to sacriﬁce for a better world,
which we ‘are conﬁdent is in ‘birth. Nevertheless, it is incum-
bent"-oii the Government, regardless of our ideological unity,

28

 

to deal with us as individuals, and not to lumpius together
as a conspiracy because of the identity of our political views.
We will try to bring you a true andaccurate picture of who

we are, what our lives have been, what we say and mean,‘

what we live by day by -day and the relation of all this im-
mediate activity to our ultimate aims. We will try to present
to you during this trial our theories and work, our program,
and our ultimate goal, the unity of theory and practice as it
says in the books. We will not do this in a classroom atmos-

phere, but so that you can understand us, in terms of our own

knowledge and experience, regardless of whet-her you agree
with us. We expect to convince you that we are within our
established constitutional rights to advocate change and pro-
gress, to advocate peace, the extension of democracy, and,
ﬁnally, to advocate Socialism, which we are convinced will
guarantee to all our people in our great and beautiful country

the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Whether we are right is no issue here, and no jury, in this or
any -other trial, but time alone, will decide. Let none of us
forget, especially in this trial in dealing with new ideas and
proposals for social change, the wise words of Abraham Lin-
coln: ‘

“This country with its institutions belongs to the
people‘ who inhabit it.”

We are asking you to decide this case on the evidence, or,
more -correctly, may I say, on the lack of evidence which we
are conﬁdent will be glaringly revealed long before this trial
is over, to decide this case on the exact issues, regardless of
fear or favor or the hysteria or prejudice which we all know
very well does exist among some groups in the community.
We ask you to keep your minds open until all the evidence,
including our own, is before you. Then you will be shown that

HISTORY OF THE COMMUNIST

PARTY OF THE UNITED STATES  

By William Z. Foster

“How have the American Communists used their theories
and Marxist-Leninist teachings to promote the advance of
the American working class to leadership in the nation?
What policies and programs of action have they produced
and applied to build the alliance of the working class with
the Negro people, the working farmers and city middle
classes? How is the Party being built, how does it function,
what is its role in the daily struggles of the masses, what
is the content of its inner life? How does the Party ﬁght
opportunism and bourgeois inﬂuences in its midst? _

“Foster’s book gives the answers. Prepare to learn, study
and popularize the History of the Communist Party of the
United States and its great lessons for today and tomorrow."

OPENING STATEMENT TO THE COURT AND JURY
IN THE CASE OF THE SIXTEEN SMITH ACT
VICTIMS IN THE TRIAL AT FOLEY SQUARE,
NEW YORK

MISS FLYN N : Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen, mypname
is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. I am a defendant in this case, act-
ing as my own attorney, and therefore have the opportunity
to address you directly. It is unusual for a defendant to repre-
sent one’s self, but my comrade, Mr. Pet-tis Perry and I have
elected to do so. Neither of us is a lawyer. We will speak to
you in the language of laymen and women, I should say.

We are both Communist leaders, proudly and avowedly.
We are qualiﬁed to explain to you what the Communist Party
of the U.S.A. really stands for, what it advocates, what its day-
by-day activities are, and what are its ultimate aims. We will
try to do so in simple, non-technical language. We will prove
to you that we are not a criminal conspiracy but a 33-year-old
working class political party, devoted to the immediate needs
and aspirations of the American people, to the advancement
of the workers, farmers and the Negro people, to the preserva-
tion of democracy and culture, and to the advocacy of Social-
ism. 5 "
Our ideas may be new and strange to you. Probably you
have never seen or met a -Communist before. We don’t ask you
to agree with us but to listen with an open mind and not to
accept as gospel truth the sensational tales of stool-pigeons
and planted agents who will be the Government's chief, if not
sole, witnesses.

‘Miss AFLYNN2 We will prove to you that we who stand ready V

to make extreme sacriﬁces for what we believe, are giving you
a true picture of the purposes of the Communist Party. It is
customary for a client to be introduced to the jury by his or
her attorney. I am my own attorney. I must, therefore, in-
troduce myself. I am an American of Irish descent. My father,
Thomas Flynn, wasborn in Maine. My mother, Anne Gurley,

was born in Galway, Ireland. I was born in Concord, ‘New-
Hampshire, 62 years ago. I married in 1908, separated-from -

myhusband shortly thereafter, and have always used my own

name. My -only son, Fred, died in 1940 at the age of 29 from I

a chest cancer. .I reside with my sister, who is a retired "school
teacher. We have lived in New York City for the past 52
years. My mothertwas a, skilled tailoress; my father, a quarry
worker who worked his way through the engineering school
of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. My father, grand-
father, and all my uncles were members of labor unions.

MISS FLYNN: To -continue, l.adies and gentlemen, one of the

essential issues in this case is my individual intent, the intent _

with which I joined the Communist Party and have remained

a member of ‘it, and the intent with which I have tried to carry ‘
I

out its program.

My intent has been shaped out of *my earlieriexperiences
and my reaction to the conditions of life, especially the con‘-
ditions of the worker.

By showing you what my intent is and what in my life
shaped that intent, I shall show you that never have I, and
not now do, I, intend to advocate the overthrow of government

‘by force and violence, nor do I -intend to bring about such

overthrow. , ‘V
I come from a family whose day-by-day diet included im-

portant social issues of the day, and from this I early learned

to question things as they are and to seek improvements.
Thus, my mother advocated Women’s Suffrage, and my father

and mother-

My father read aloud to me and to my brother and sisters

such’ books as the Communist Manifesto and other writings

of Marxand Engels, w-hich the Government will use as evi-
dence in the trial.
, I was a serious child, due probably to these childish impres-
sio'ns- which are background to my aﬂiliation in my extreme
"youth with the Socialist movement and inimy mature years
withtthe Communist Party- , ‘ .‘ _ .

‘Times were hard; ‘We were-poor. My ﬁrst experience with
discrimination was in Manchester, New Hampshire, when my
father ran for -city engineer about 1895. I heardtft said he was

i defeated because he was Irish. He was very bitter on this

subject and told us of signs on factorieswhen he was a boy,

“No Irish need apply.”

will be an issue in this case, was a vivid recollection of my
father’s opposition to the Spanish-American War and his
insistence on‘ the right of the Cuban and Philippine "peoples
totheir iindependence. He—~’joi‘ned an anti-imperialist." league

to protest against our country embarking on the evil path
of imperialism, which we will prove began at that time.

The conditions in the textile towns of New Hampshire and
Massachusetts contributed to my later joining the Communist
Party, which, as Mr. Lane says, concentrates on the recruiting
of workers in industry; huge gray mills, like prisons, barrack-
like company boarding houses, long hours, low wages, long
periods of slack; the prosperous owner lived in the center of
Adams, Massachusetts, and rode around in his ﬁne carriage
with its beautifult horses. I ‘saw lard instead of butter on
neighbors’ tables, children without underwear in cold New
Englan-d winters, a girl scalped by an unguarded machine in
a mill across the street from our school. I saw an old man
weeping as they put him in the lock-up as a tramp.

Then we came to live in the drab South Bronx, near the
New Haven Railroad’s roundhouse, in a -cold water, unheated,
gas-lit ﬂat. Casualties and accidents were high among the rail-
road workers. Children were maimed as they gathered coal
in the yards in bad times. My mother helped women in the
neighborhood who could not afford a doctor when a baby
came.

willing, able, and anxious to work, denied jobs? Why was
there so much unemployment? Why were there rich people

“Should the Government own the mines?” I said, “Yes, it
should.” ‘ .
This was during the great anthracite coal strike in 1902. I
attended Bronx Socialist meetings in 1905; later at the Harlem
Socialist Club at 12 5th Street. My speaking career started in
1906 on the ambitious subject of women under socialism.
Naturally, I drew heavily on authors, American women, like
Charlotte Petingill and Susan B. Anthony, also on a book
written in 1872 by Augustus Bebel, a Socialist member of the
German Reichstag, written while he was in prison under
Bismarck’s anti-Socialist laws. It was ﬁrst publishe-d here’ by
the Socialist Lab-or Party in 1904. I am puzzled to see it on
the Government’s list of documents. What relation it has to
this indictment is hard to fathom, unless to advocate the full
political, economic, and social emancipation of women has
be-come a form of advocacy of the overthrow of government
by for-ce and violence under the G-0vernment’s interpretation
of the Smith Act. But if thishistoric and economic study,
which is very much out of date today, is to be ﬁnely tooth-
combed for sentences which torn out of context can distort its
meaning, this, we will prove, can be done to any book, no
matter what its purpose, even to the Bible, Shakespeare, or
Gray’s Anatomy. .
My youthful ambition, believe it or not, was to be a con-
stitutionallawyer. Instead, I ‘became a labor organizer. Then
it was called, an agitator, or, by the press, one who stirred
up the people. I was determined to do something about the
bad -conditi0_ns._under,w_hich our family and all around us
suffered. .I have stuck .to that purpose for 46 years. I, consider
