only if it exists for the Negro. The reverse is also true. Democracy
for the Negro is possible only if it exists for all. A mandatory
precondition for success in the struggle against reaction is unity be-
tween Negro and white.

Unity at the Point of Production

What then is the starting point for tackling this basic problem
of unity which is at the heart of the struggle for democracy in this
country? It is the point of production. Why the point of produc-
tion? It is here that monopoly practices its divisive policies. It is
here that monopoly's discriminatory practices against Negroes
force them into unskilled -and semi-skilled jobs. It is here that
monopoly pays Negroes annually billions less than it pays to white
workers for corresponding work. This represents a major source
of superproﬁts derived from the Negro people as a whole. It is on
the job that Negro labor is to be found working side by side with
white labor, though the exploitation of the Negro is far greater.

The wage differential is used by monopoly as a form of bribery
of the white workers. The creation of lily-white -and ghetto com-
munities is monopo1y’s attempt to maintain and widen the divi-
sions which begin at the point of production and is designed to
maintain the dominance of monopoly over both Negro and white.

The primary issue that is posed is to wipe out discrimination
on the job and thus to win for the Negro workers the billions of
dollars of which they are now being robbed. With this, the pur-
chasing power of the whole Negro community would be greatly
increased.

The relationship of such a struggle to the ﬁght against the ghetto
is immediately apparent. But what is also clear is that the struggle
to achieve such an objective would not only eliminate this differ-
ential between Negro and white but in addition would guarantee
that the wage standards for both Negro and white could be raised
to new and higher levels. VVhat is evident is that the ﬁght to put
an end to the special exploitation of the Negro worker represents
the interests of the working class as a whole. From this it follows
that the labor movement must. place high on its agenda the ending
of inequality in the shops as well as in the community.

Metmgfs Line

In this connection, let me draw attention to the following im-
portant developments:

The importance of the Meany-Randolph confrontation in 1959
was not fully appreciated. Yet this was a development which re-
ﬂected growing moods of militancy within the ranks of organized
labor, moods which affected Negro workers in the ﬁrst place but
large numbers of white workers as well. Rando1ph’s challenge to
Meany, head of the AFL-CIO, was supported not only by Negro
workers but also by a united Negro people. This unity was in turn
supported by progressive white trade unionists, and was a dramatic
and high point of the new developments which are growing in the
labor movement. Unfortunately, important demonstrative actions
such as marches, sit-ins and the like tend more often than not to
shove to the background events which ﬂow from such confronta-
tions as the above. Yet it must be said that it is precisely the latter
developments that constitute an indispensable rallying point which
when joined with the other movements can assure victory for full
equality.

The November 1966 issue of the American Faderationist is de-
voted exclusively to the problems of the Negro worker. This is the
ﬁrst time in history that this labor journal has been devoted entirely
to this subject. Read it and you will ﬁnd many inadequacies.
Read it and you will find many wrong views. But read it and you
will also ﬁnd views which, if acted upon by progressive forces within
the unions, can advance the struggle for equality to a new and
higher level.

George Meany is to the right of Johnson on the war in Vietnam.
He is notorious for his anti-Communism. Nonetheless, Mr. Meany
ﬁnds it necessary to speak up against discrimination. Obviously
the struggle against inequality is in contradiction to a policy which
supports a criminal and unjust war against the Vietnamese people
and a policy based on anti-Communism. The fact that Mr. Meany
raises this question at all is due to new developments among Negro
and white workers to advance the struggle for equality on the job.
It follows that advanced forces within the ranks of labor desiring
to advance the struggle for equality can utilize such expressions
to arouse the organized millions. An effective struggle in this sphere

ll

 

must in turn merge with and strengthen the struggles for a rejection
of anti-Communism and an end to the war in Vietnam.

The Common Foe——Monopoly

Here is an editorial by George Meany which appeared in the
same issue of the American Federationist. He says among other
things:

“There is in America today a so-called white backlash. It is
deplorable. It was born out of the ability of demagogues to
capitalize upon rioting. It stems from unreasoning fear stimu-
lated by the reckless cries of ‘black power.’ ”

In this statement Mr. Meany whitewashes the monopolists. He
whitewashes the ultra-Right and places the responsibility for what
he terms the “so-called white backlas ” upon the struggle of the
oppressed Negro people. ' A ‘

Clearly one must reject such a statement. But then there is a
second one. He dedicates the AFL-CIO to building a decent
America and he continues: “It is poverty and ignorance and despair
that are the real root causes of all of America’s domestic problems.”

Two things have to be said here. First, Mr. Meany points up
the fact that the AFL-CIO—labor--cannot turn its back upon the
struggle for democracy. Neither can it turn its back upon poverty,
ignorance and despair. I think that irrespective of how one inter-
prets this observation, it is clear that the Left and advanced pro-
gressive forces within the trade union movement and in the shops
must give proper consideration to this statement if they wish to give
effective aid to the ﬁght for equality in the shops.

At the same time, Mr. Meany argues that the root cause of all
of America’s domestic ills is poverty, ignorance and despair. Is this
correct? Of course not. The cause of all our domestic ills, the cause
of all our international problems is monopoly capitalism in this
country. Mr. Meany’s statement conceals the brutal hand of mo-
nopoly, the force responsible for the inequality between Negro and
white. T

The forces responsible for the criminal war against the people
of Vietnam are- likewise those of monopoly. The forces that will

-12

 

 

eventually lay U.S. monopoly capitalism low are the organized
millions, Negro and white, who are to be found in the plants of
Ford and General Motors, in the steel mills of Gary and Pittsburgh,
in the General Electric plants, and in basic industry generally.

It is not possible, however, to develop a consistent struggle for
democracy and for socialism unless one becomes concerned with
the immediate problems of the working class—~wages, hours, in-
equality, speedup, problems ﬂowing from automation, unemploy-
ment, Section l4b of the Taft-Hartley Act, and so on. It is there-
fore incumbent upon the New Left which is emerging outside of
the labor movement and which regards the labor movement as part
of “the establishment” to understand the indispensability of the
struggle for immediate demands if they wish to achieve so-cialism.
Socialism is possible of achievement only to the degree that the
working class ﬁrst of all is convinced of its need. That class has

«to be won at the point of production.

Failure to see this can only mean that the source of the special
exploitation of the Negro worker at the point of production, from
which the monopolists extract extra surplus value, remains un-
challenged. If this is not seen, then all talk about Negro equality
is merely phrasemongering.

This problem ‘must be tackled by the labor movement, Negro and
white. This is basic to strengthening Negro-white solidarity. It is
basic to maintaining, defending and extending the trade union
movement in this country. It is basic to the whole question of alli-
ance between labor and the Negro people. It is basic to realizing
the objectives of struggle for peace, democracy and equality in this
country.

III. Negro Freedom and Vietnam
Two Basic Concepts

In this connection, two requirements are posed -at one and the
same time. First: the indispensability, as a precondition for the
strengthening of labor solidarity, of conducting a struggle on the
job against monopoly policies which consciously uphold the ideol-
ogy and practice of white supremacy. Second: the solution of the

13

 

 

problem of strengthening the alliance between the labor movement
and the Negro people, in which success depends upon how the ﬁght
for economic equality of the Negro worker is tackled on the job.

The two concepts—labor solidarity and the alliance of labor
and the Negro people—constitute the cornerstone of the struggle
for democracy in the USA. The accomplishment of a qualitative
improvement in the development of mass struggle against the Ad-
ministration’s war policies in Vietnam and against the ultra-Right
is largely dependent upon an understanding of the primacy of this
point. This is how our Party places the question. It ‘is this ap-
proach which gives substance to the struggle for the solution of the
special problems of the Negro people.

Two errors are made on this most important question. One is
the notion in the labor movement that the ‘problems of Negroes
can be solved only when there is ‘full employment for all. This
kind of thinking overlooks the central fact that the widespread un-
employment -aggravated by automation and cybernation hits ﬁrst
and hardest at the Negro worker. An effective struggle for full
employment has meaning only if there is a day-to-day ﬁght against
discrimination today.

The struggle against monopoly discrimination must be developed
as an integral part of the struggle for full employment. This ﬁght
must be extended to include full support to the ﬁght of the Negro
people for integration -and for their demands in the ghetto.

Second is the thinking among certain nationalist ‘groupings in
the Negro community which poses as primary the idea of- self-
suﬂiciency of the Negro community. Such a position overlooks the
fact that the main mass of the Negro people work for a living in
the industries and services outside of the ghetto. While correctly
ﬁghting to bring about basic changes within the ghetto, this outlook
fails to take into account the fact that the ghetto cannot eco-
nomically fully absorb» this mass of people, that is, give them
employment. Moreover, the proponents of this View do not even
place for action the need of a resolute struggle among Negro and
white workers for a change in the economic status of the Negro
workers in all areas of the economy. But it is crystal-clear that
to give meaning to the ﬁght for economic change in the ghetto,
this struggle must be linked to the general ﬁght for changing the
economic status of the Negro people in the country as a whole.

The “Freedom Budget” and the
Fight for Peace

In this connection, I should like to call attention to A “Freedom
Budget” for All Americans-the result of the work of a conference
organized by Bayard Rustin, director of the A. Philip Randolph
Institute. This “Freedom Budget” proposes an expenditure by
the Federal government of $185 billion over the next 10 years to
achieve “freedom from want.” It is supported 'by a veritable VVho’s
Who in the l-abor and Negro people's movements. It concerns itself
with such problems as abolition of poverty, guaranteed full em-
ployment, full production and high economic growth, adequate
minimum wages, farm income parity, guaranteed incomes for all
unable to work, a decent home for every American family, modern
health services for all, full educational opportunity for all, updated
social security and welfare programs, and equitable tax and mone-
tary policies.

This is indeed an ambitious undertaking. Certainly the authors
of this program can be under no illusion that such -a great task
can be achieved solely on the basis of an expenditure of $185
billion in a period of 10 years. Nor should there be any illusion
that even this sum will be granted out of the “benevolence” of
the powers-that-be. Yet these authors have performed a real service
in proving that federal expenditures on a meaningful level are
both necessary and possible. We hasten to state, however, that
wresting this sum from the federal government can have real mean-
ing only if the tens of millions at the grass roots make such an
objective their very own, so that it becomes a weapon of mass
struggle against the war in Vietnam—-against monopoly.

Should we give support to this “Freedom Budget”? I say without
hesitation, yes. I say this despite the fact that I differ with many
of the economic and political considerations advanced in its sup-

rt. -
poThere are those that say it is possible to achieve such an objective
even though there is war in Vietnam, that ways can be found to
get the money without reducing the huge sums now spent for war.
What can we say about this? This line of thinking fails to project
a struggle against the criminal war of aggression by U.S. impe-

15

 

  

rialism in Vietnam and could lead many to believe that a certain
accommodation can be made with that war. It gives rise to the
dangerous illusion that it is possible to have both guns and butter.

There are others who say that one does not have to concern
oneself with separate appropriations for the war and for the eco-
nomic and social needs of the people. They argue that there can
be one appropriation from which money is taken both for the war
and for the economic and social needs of the people. But this is
only a variation of the same “guns and butter” idea.

It must be said that with such an approach this “Freedom Bud-
get” is not presented as an imperative need which, if placed cor-
rectly, can be developed and fought for as a part of the struggle
to put an end to the war in Vietnam. '

Then there are those who say that you can't do anything any-
how until the war is over. Here, too, no line of struggle against
the war is projected. Rather it is a wait-and-see policy, a policy
which says that the struggle to meet the economic needs of the
people can wait until the war is ended.

Need one argue against this fallacious concept? VVhat must be
seen is what was mentioned earlier—the necessity of anchoring the
struggle in the grass roots. VVhat is obvious is that support of the
“Freedom Budget" and the ﬁght for its realization necessarily mean
a struggle against all false and misleading ideas on the one hand,
and a struggle for clarity on the other. For unless this is done,
the result will be confusion among the masses and the blunting
of their vigilance and militancy in struggle.

These wrong views, unless rejected, can become a major de-
terrent to the development of the labor movement. And if spon-
taneous movements develop, such wrong views can derail them.
If they are not fully clear on these questions, there is also the
danger that the masses in their eagerness to secure much—needed
economic reforms may be misled into supporting the most brutal
and unjust war now being waged by U.S. imperialism against the
people of Vietnam. In this regard, the role of our Party in help-
ing to build a ﬁghting movement of the millions assumes an im-
portance greater than ever before. ‘

IV. The Negro American
Lahor Council

A Dual Role

I think that the creation of the Negro American Labor Council
was a major stroke on the part of labor. This important organi-
zation can become a most powerful medium for waging the ideo-
logical struggle to show that the interests of the white workers and
the strengthening of class solidarity demand a new and quickened
consciousness of the need to put an end to the economic inequality
forced upon the Negro workers by monopoly. The Negro Ameri-
can Labor Council at the same time can play a most important role
in the involvement of Negro workers in the leadership of the
Negro people's movement. Acting thus, the Negro American Labor
Council can help to develop a ﬁghting alliance between labor and
the Negro people in a common program which unites Negro and
white workers against the common enemy in every ﬁeld of endeavor.
This formation represents something new. Developments are now
taking place which open up new possibilities for its growth. That
is why leaders of the NALC are now calling for the building of
NALC committees in all unions. .

The problem of automation must become one of increasing
concern to the NALC. For it aggravates the problem of abolishing
the inequality invskills. Meany and others say that this cannot be
remedied until everybody in the United States has a job. Thus they
put forth a perspective of continued inequality until the, problem for
all is solved. On the contrary, the problem of achieving equality
for all can be solved only to the extent that solidarity is achieved
on the job, a solidarity which recognizes the special needs of the
Negro worker and establishes unity with him in struggle to meet
these needs.

The NALC can help to develop further in the unions a cam-
paign of enlightenment against racist ideas and practices. This is
imperative for the maintenance of the trade union movement and

J7

 

  

the unfolding of a drive to organize the unorganized in the North
and especially in the South. The effort by the steelworkers’ union
at its recent convention and the steps being taken by many other
unions to reestablish fair employment practices committees in the
locals is a most welcome sign. The NALC in addition can play a
most important part in promoting the ﬁght to integrate Negroes
into policy-making bodies on all levels of leadership in the trade
union movement.

Properly understood, the NALC must be regarded as one of the
main forces for building unity within the labor movement and de-

veloping the alliance of labor and the Negro people in the ﬁght for
full equality.

Approach to White Workers

The ﬁght for equality must begin now. It must be raised to a
higher level and become a part of the everyday consciousness of the
trade union movement. Let me give an instructive experience.

Important headway has been made in bringing the meaning of the
menace of racism to a larger mass of the rank and ﬁle. But one
thing is still lacking. The arguments presented to the white workers
smack too much of liberal white moralistic preachments and are
not placed in sharp enough class and trade union self—interest
terms. That is, the workers are not told bluntly enough that unless
freedom for the Negro people is practiced everywhere—in the com-
munity as well as in the shop—a sharp and dangerous collision may
arise between the labor movement and the Negro people and he
reﬂected in a cleavage in the ranks of labor itself. No union in
mass industry today can exist.without the support of the Negro
people, both inside and outside the shops. Yet unity in the shop
cannot last if disunity in the neighborhood is countenanced.

A refreshing example of how this matter was placed squarely and
correctly to workers who were prejudiced, and with excellent re-
sults, is to be found in this incident taken from a recent news
report:

“V/Vhen segments of United Federation of Teachers in Staten
Island threatened to resign from the union due to their dis-
agreement with the union’s support of the Review Board, Al-

18

 

 

bert Shanker, President of the UFT, was able to convince them
that the union's position w-as right. Staten Island teachers are
the most conservative in the union. Shanker could not con-
vince them fully of the merits of the Board. He could only dis-
pel some of their illusions on how it functioned. He won them
over by pointing out that the UFT was going into contract ne-
gotiations and they had in the past gotten the support of Ne-
groes and Puerto Ricans. The UFT, he continued, again
needed the support of these minority groups and if teachers
did not support them on issues they felt were important, then
teachers could expect nothing in return. With this coalition
argument he convinced most of the teachers and none re-

signed.”

Is this not an example which should be emulated and become
the basis of daily operation in every union throughout the coun-

try?

V. The 1966 Elections

For a Negro-Labor Electoral Alliance

Last November's elections also contain many rich experiences
relating to the struggle for Negro rights. I listened to the election
returns as they were coming in and heard the Democrat Mahoney
who was running for governor in Maryland make a premature
victory statement, before all the returns were in. The main plank
in Mahoney’s program had been racist. He made his appeal to the
most backward sentiments of the white voters with the slogan,
“Your home is your castle.”

To counter this the United Steelworkers conducted a massive
campaign. The union issued brochures and leaﬂets, held meetings
and made radio appearances, and it is to its everlasting credit that
it played an independent role, broke relations with the Democratic

About the Author

Mississippi-born Henry Winston is
only two generations from slavery. His
grandfather was a slave. When he was
eleven, the Winston family moved
from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, to
Kansas City, Missouri. The young
Henry attended Jim Crow schools in
both states, including two years of
high school; worked at whatever jobs
he could get (dishwasher, painter,
bricklayer, secretary); read and stud-
ied by himself.

At 19, Winston joined the Young
Communist League and plunged into
the struggles of the unemployed in
his home state and also participated in the National Hunger
March to Washington, D. C. in 1932 for unemployment insurance
and relief. He aided the Scottsboro Boys, took part in the National
Negro Congress and in the Southern Conference for Human Wel-
fare and in many other battles for Negro and working class free-
dom. He has held the posts of National Administrative Secretary
of the Young Communist League and National Organization Sec-
retary of the Communist Party.

Winston served in World War II for three years and eight
months and received an honorable discharge. Soon after, he was
convicted under the imfamous Smith Act and in 1956 began an
8-year prison sentence which was finally, after worldwide protest,
commuted by President Kennedy for “reasons of health” after
Winston had served nearly six years and had lost his sight due to
brutal negligence of the prison authorities.

After his release in 1961, Winston went abroad for three years.
He was in the Soviet Union for medical treatment and also visited
six republics of that land as well as five other European countries.
On his return he entered again into active participation in the
work of the Communist Party, and at its 18th National Conven-
tion in June 1966 was elected to the post of National Chairman.

This pamphlet contains the text of a report presented to a
meeting of the National Committee, CPUSA, December 6, 1966.

machine, supported the Republican candidate Agnew and helped to
defeat Mahoney. At the same time the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE) and other organizations of the Negro people carried on
a campaign against Mahoney. The result was that only one out of
every 37 Negroes voted for Mahoney. Here we have a practical
illustration of a developing alliance between labor and the Negro
people on the electoral front.

The trade union movement is concerned ﬁrst of all with economic
problems affecting Negro and white workers. It is also concerned
with political and social issues, as the Maryland example indicates.
It ﬁghts for labor legislation which defends the vital interests of
labor and the people and seeks the election of pro-labor and pro-
democratic candidates. It cannot be said, however, that the labor
movement fully understands and appreciates as yet the necessity
of supporting the election of Negro candidates to city, state and
federal offices. This deplorable situation is to be explained on the
one hand by the white supremacist policies of the ruling circles
but also, on the other hand, by the failure of labor actively to
combat this form of racism and to take measures to change this
situation. Labor's understanding of the kind of ﬁght-back needed
in the struggle against the unholy alliance of the ultra-Right, the
reactionary Republicans and the Dixiecrats will be measured by its
actions on this question.

Negro Representation—Still To Be Won

The congressional elections point up some positive experiences

' which must become general. The election of Edward W. Brooke

of Massachuetts to the U.S. Senate was a great achievement. He is
the ﬁrst Negro popularly elected to this august body. The six in-
cumbent Negro congressmen were reelected. However, there was
no increase in the number of Negroes in the House of Repre-
sentatives. And more, efforts are under way to unseat one of the
six—-Adam Clayton Powell.

The following ﬁgures are taken from a survey made by Ernest
Calloway of the teamsters’ union to show the advances of the Negro
people in the legislative ﬁeld (“Negro Political Revolt Took Place
in Cities,” Missouri Teamster, December 1966):

_ Measured against the past, the ﬁgures for these states show
progress. But it is still like a pebble in the ocean compared to
what must be achieved. There are hundreds of thousands of public
officials on all levels, elected and appointed, but how many are Ne-
groes? All of us may well be astounded when I tell you that the
total ﬁgure of elected Negroes throughout the whole country is only
163! There are no popularly elected Negro mayors (Flint, Michi-
gan; Springﬁeld, Ohio; Mt. Bayou, Mississippi; two small towns
in California and one in Texas, have mayors chosen by city coun-
cils or appointed, and having very limited powers). There is not a
single Negro governor in the country, not one lieutenant governor
or attorney general.

These are the cold facts and the conclusions we must draw
_are quite clear. Look at the situation: only one Negro in the Senate
and six in the House—one from New York, one from Pennsylvania,
one from Illinois, one from California and two from Michigan.
Is this not a distinctly unsatisfactory situation? Why are such limits
placed on Negro representation that states like New Jersey, Ohio,
Maryland, Missouri, Georgia, Alabama, Texas and Mississippi,
to mention only a few, do not have a single Negro congressman?
This shame must be erased.

Prepare Now for 1968

There are at le-ast 35-50 congressional areas where the Negro
vote is decisive, but these areas are dominated by the political
machines which dictate that they be represented by whites. The
right of Negroes to be elected to public oﬂice should exist even
in areas where they are not the decisive force. The election of
Brooke in Massachusetts where Negroes constitute only 2 per cent
of the voters is instructive. The task that is put for the 1968
elections is to begin now to prepare for the participation of Negro
candidates in the primaries and for their election to office in
November. Increased Negro representation on all levels must be
fought for, and fought for now. Our Party must help the labor
movement understand that independent political action of Negro
and white to achieve this objective is an urgent and indispensable
part of the ﬁght for democracy.

All of labor’s efforts should be directed to strengthening its
bonds with the Negro people as a whole. Changes in the status
of the Negro people are dependent upon their strengthened rela-
tionship with the labor movement. If this is achieved, great gains in
the struggle for economic, political and social equality of the Negro
people are assured. In this connection I wish to discuss the problem
of unity within the Negro people's movement itself. There are
many complex problems in the development of this unity, which
is vitally needed.

VI. The “Black Power” Slogan
and Negro Unity

Meaning of “Black Power”

The slogan of “black power” articulated by Stokely Carmichael
was an immediate response to the gunning down of James Meredith
under conditons in which he was left with no federal or state pro-
tection of any kind. But the slogan was swiftly extended to encom-
pass the entire struggle for equality, though its full meaning was not
immediately grasped by those who used it. There is nothing

22

 

strange in this, however; in the course of struggle, slogans tend to
emerge rough-cut and must then undergo a process of further re-
ﬁning and polishing.

Thus, the ﬁght against Dixiecrat-Bourbon rule was conceived
only in terms of areas of Negro majority but was generally applied.
The approach to the problem in areas where Negroes are not a
majority h-ad yet to be formulated. Moreover, the urgent necessity
of unity between Negro and white was not understood. The fact
is that even now a proper formulation of this idea is still in the
process of development.

Thus, for example, a recent meeting of SNCC voted on the ques-
tion of the exclusion of whites from its deliberative bodies. The
vote was as follows: 19 for exclusion; 18 against (in which group
was to be found Stokely Carmichael); and 24 abstentions. Three
tendencies -are expressed here. The tendency which is correct is
that which envisions the unity of Negro and white in the demo-
cratic struggle.

The slogan of ‘‘black power” has projected the Negro question
in a new way. It is now being discussed everywhere. James Jackson
in his pamphlet “The Meaning of Black Power” develops the
attitude of Communists to this slogan. In our view, the essence
of the concept of “black power” means that everywhere, without
a single exception, the Negro people must win their full equality.
In areas where they constitute a majority they must have the rights
of a majority. This means that in places like Lowndes County,
Alabama the Negro people have every right to elect their own
oflicials to ofﬁce. It means that where the Negro people are a
minority they must also have equal rights—that is, the right to
share in power, in leadership, the right to have black sons and
daughters elected to any and all posts of leadership in accord
with their capabilities, without any discrimination whatsoever.
It means that in coalitions of whites and Negroes, the Negroes
can never be treated as second class participants but must be treated
as absolute equals, without whose consent no decisions are made.

This does not mean that black will go it alone and white will
go it alone. It means that a new, more basic relationship must
arise which takes into account the common interests of both. It
means that in mass organizations and movements, including the
trade union movement, the allegiance of Negro membership

23,

 

  

cannot be taken for granted on the part of the white members.
It must be fought for and must constantly be rewon by combattihg
every form of white supremacist views, and by making clear to
the white workers that any backtracking on this fundamental
question places their own union and class interests in jeopardy.
Of course, black power is a democratic slogan; it is not in itself the
full answer.

Such is the substance of the slogan “black power” which arose
out of the march on Jackson, Mississippi, a march which demanded
federal intervention to protect the Constitutional rights of the
Negro people. From it, the democratic demand for the establish-
ment of guarantees to exercise the right to vote emerged as the
rallying cry which united the Negro people.

Confusions and Distortions

Several observations can be made about this slogan. The first
is that it developed in the ﬁght for the most elementary democratic
rights in the black belt of Mississippi. Like all people’s slogans
which develop in the heat of battle, it was given varying interpre-
tations. VVhat has happened is that its true meaning has been
beclouded in heated debate, with much honest confusion and
with much dishonest distortion.

The monopoly-controlled press is an example of the latter. These
newspapers fully understood that this developing democratic mass
movement was immediately directed toward winning political
rights for the Negro majority. So they reasoned that if you have
Negro mayors, city councilmen, attorney generals, lieutenant gov-
ernors and governors, this could lead to bringing about great
radical changes in all spheres beginning with industry and in-
cluding land reform. The ﬁght for equality would be raised to
new and higher levels, which means, among other things, putting
an end to the differential in earnings between Negro and white
which permits Wall Street to extract added billions in superproﬁts.

The commercial press therefore sensationalized the slogan and
presented it as being one of race against race. Here we have a
major effort to sow doubt and confusion in the ranks of the masses
of people. ‘

There were also distortions of the slogan by the Negro national-
ists. They interpreted this slogan of “black power" as being an ex-

 

 

pression of the growing independence of the Negro people's
movement based on a “go it alone” policy. They concluded that
an alliance between Negro and white in struggle for democracy
in general and equal rights for the Negro people in particular
is hopeless. But what has been happening in reality is that a
struggle is developing among the Negro people not for separation
from the democratic white masses, but for separation from the
economic, political and social oppression imposed upon them by
Wall Street and Southern Bourbon-Dixiecrat rule.

How to cut through the maze of confusion and bring clarity to
the concept of black power, how to undertake every possible meas-
ure to strengthen the growing unity of the Negro people in their
ﬁght for first-class citizenship and to uphold the principles under-
lying this slogan—this is a major task of our Party.

“Crisis and Commitment”: A Line of

Appeasement

On October 14, 1966 the statement “Crisis and Commitment”
appeared in the New York Times. It was initiated by the NAACP,
and was endorsed by the following individuals:

Dorothy Height, President, National Council of Negro Women;

A. Philip Randolph, President, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters, AFL-CIO;

Bay-ard Rustin, Director, A. Philip Randolph Institute;

Roy Wilkins, Executive Director, National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People;

Whitney M. Young, Jr., Executive Director, National Urban
League; p

Amos T. Hall, Executive Secretary, Conference of Grand Masters,
Prince Hall Masons of America;

Hobson R. Reynolds, Grand Exalted Ruler, Improved Benevolent
and Protective Order of the Elks of the World.

These are the m-ain organizations representing the integrationist
trend in the Negro community.

The statement put the question this way: “No one can . . . doubt
or ignore the depth of crisis which today confronts Negro Americans
. .  Recognizing the existence of “confusion and uncertainty"
among the “majority population” and their “intensiﬁed resistance

to change,” the signers of the statement feel compelled to restate
the “principles upon which the civil rights movement rests.” These
principles as formulated by the signatories are:

“I. We are committed to the attainment of racial justice by the
democratic process. The force of law and its fulﬁllment in the
courts, legislative halls and implementing agencies, the appeal
to conscience, and the exercise of the rights of peaceful assembly
and petition are the instrumentalities of our choice. We propose
to win genuine partnership for all our people in the United
States, within the framework of this nation's constitution.

“II. We repudiate any strategies of violence, reprisal or vigi-
lantism, and we condemn both rioting and the demogoguery
that feeds it, for these are the ﬁnal resort of despair, and we
have not yielded to despair. Defense of one’s family, home and
self against attack is not an issue; it is a basic American prin-
ciple and must not be perverted into a cover for aggressive
violence.

“III. We are committed to integration, by which we mean an
end to every barrier which segregation and other forms of dis-
crimination have raised against the enjoyment by Negro Ameri-
cans of their human and constitutional rights. We believe that
a sense of personal worth and a pride in race are vital to
integration in a pluralistic society, but we believe that these are
best nurtured by success in achieving equality. We reject the
way of separatism, either moral or spatial.

“IV. As we are committed to the goal of integration into every
aspect of the national life, we are equally committed to the
common responsibility of all Americans, both white and black,
for bringing integration to pass. We not only welcome, we urge,
the full cooperation of white Americans in what must be a
joint endeavor if it is to prosper. It should go without saying,
that, in seeking full equality for Negroes, we cannot and will
not deny it to others who join our ﬁght.”

What is evident here is a capitulation to the attack by the racists

of every hue against the slogan of “black power.” This statement

26

 

 

fails to identify the class source of racism and fails to call for
the support of all democratic forces not only to defeat reaction
but to make gre-at and new advances in the struggle for Negro
rights. This urgent necessity is watered down in such a way as
to conceal the big money interests which sparkplugged this vicious
racist campaign. Such a line of appeasement, geared to a policy
of accommodation to the war policies of the Johnson Administra-
tion, can never become -a winning policy capable of realizing ﬁrst-
class citizenship for the Negro people. It is indeed signiﬁcant that
the names of Reverend Martin Luther King, Fred McKissick of
CORE and Stokely Carmichael of SNCC are missing as signatories
of this statement.

Restricting the Struggle—
Jackie Robins¢m’s Program

The ﬁght for the inner unity of the Negro people’s movement
means, therefore, that all progressives within these organizations
must ﬁght to change all policies which stiﬂe the independent
political action of the Negro people’s organizations and tie them
to the existing political machines.

Let me illustrate another problem in this respect.

Jackie Robinson, in one of his columns in the Chicago Daily
Defender last October, says: “Dr. Powell's call . . . to ‘exercise a
mass responsibility for their [the Negro people’s] fate’ can be
endorsed without hesitancy. VVhile I can't agree that our efforts in
the past 5 years have been ‘a magniﬁcent exercise of near futility
with our marches, our picketing, and now our rebellion,’ I believe
further use of these tactics would result in futility.”

VVhat is evident here is that Adam Powell's estimate of yesterday's
struggles becomes Jackie Robinson's estimate of today’s struggles
—and this at a time when the economic position of the Negro
is worsened and the economic gap between Negro and white grows
wider.

In terms of program Jackie Robinson thinks that “black initia-
tive” and “black productivity” are two elements which can “move
us forward rapidly.” But posing the problem in this way limits

27

 

  

the struggle to a small segment of the Negro people. It does not
take into account a program for the main mass of the Negro people
—jobs, housing, an end to police brutality and other democratic
demands.

Jackie Robinson points up the fact that: “There is real strength
among us. We are generally the balance of power in elections,
and earnings of 27 billions per year represent real strength. . . ."
He suggests that “what is now needed is a sincere effort by Dr.
Powell, Roy Wilkins, Dr. King, Whitney Young and A. Philip Ran-
dolph to mobilize these forces. . . .”

The question arises: If unity of the Negro people is to be
achieved, how can it be explained that the names of Floyd McKissick
and Stokely Carmichael are excluded? Is it possible to achieve a
people's untity without them? Obviously not. ‘

“Equal Rights” and “Equal Power”

Gus Savage, editor of the Chatham Citizen, a Chicago weekly,
likewise advances the need for unity. In the issue of July 6, 1966,’
basing himself on Section 221 (d-3) of the Federal Housing Act,
which “permits the government to insure 100 per cent of a mortgage
to private parties for the purpose of constructing so-called middle
income non-proﬁt or limited dividend housing, at reasonable
rents,” he relates the following story about Englewood Manor in
Chicago: “The ﬁve oﬂicers and directors of this project—headed by
Sagan, who lives in a rambling mansion in Hyde Park, and dom-
inated by whites—have tricked so-called middle income Negro
families into slum-living at an. unbelievable rent.”

He then makes this important observation:

“Moreover, practically all the building's income is derived from
Negroes, while proﬁts from this non-proﬁt project go to whites-
white realtors, white architects, white general contractors, white
redecorating contractors, etc.

“Thus, the federal government which, in words, advocates
ending slums and making Negroes equal to whites, in deeds is
ﬁnancing bigger and better slums in which to imprison Negroes
in ever increasing white power in Negro neighborhoods.”

28

It is under these conditions that Gus Savage disagrees with the
emphasis by Martin Luther King on the struggle for “equal rights,"
and believes that the main slogan in the ghetto is for “equal power."

I believe, however, that the two concepts are joined and that
the struggle for equal rights and equal power must go hand in
hand, in the North as well as in the South, in the ﬁght for jobs
and the increase of purchasing power in the Negro community,
for the massive building of low-cost housing within the ghetto, for
the building of schools, hospitals, recreation facilities, etc.

A Defense of Reaction

Dr. J. H. Jackson is president of the National Baptist Convention
which consists of some ﬁve million Negro Baptists. His philosophy
was expressed in a “Call for National Unity" issued August 31, 1965.
He states: “To paraphrase the historic statement of Booker T.
Washington, in all things strictly personal and in all things purely
private we can be as separate as the ﬁngers, but one as the hand
in all things tending toward the mutual progress of the individual,
of groups, as well as the fulﬁllment of the nation's life itself."

This arch defender of segregation supports the status quo and
pursues a line of policy which opposes the struggle for economic,
political and social equality, and at the same time dovetails with
the policies of the most reactionary forces in American life. Here
are some samples from his 10-point program which will suﬁice
to explain the reason for his no-struggle policy:

"1. Unqualiﬁed loyalty to and support of the nation as a whole.

"2. Risk all that we have and possess for the life, soul, and
salvation of the nation, and trust a just nation to protect and
save us as citizens and all that we hold dear, so long as it does
not include the values of religion which are above the dominion
of the state."

He concludes:

"This Call is for positive thinking and for positive action. It is
not enough to be anti-Communist, anti-poverty, anti-segregation-
ist, anti-integrationist; we must be pro-American, pro-freedom,

N EGIIO -WHITE UNITY
By HENRY WAINSTIIN

I. The New (Iffensive of Racism

Portrait of a Racist

The other night I was listening to the Susskind television pro-
gram. On that program there appeared the mayor of Waukegan,
Illinois and a small businessman from Northwest Chicago. I shall
not speak at this moment about the mayor of Waukegan. We
read about him in the press. We know him. But I will speak
about the small businessman from the Northwest side of Chicago.

From the conventional white Anglo-Saxon point of view this
man would be considered a handsome man, with blonde hair, hale
and hearty. But one could arrive at such a conclusion only if one
did not hear this person speak. Once he opened his mouth one
could see his ugliness. For this man spewed only hatred, showed
only vile racism toward the Negro people of Chicago and the en-
tire country. I/Vhy was this so? Because in his warped mind, he
could only think of ‘the Negro people as dirty. In his white su-
premacist view he blamed the Negro people and not the city au-
thorities for failure to remove garbage from ghetto streets. In his
twisted vision Negroes had highly polished Cadillacs but preferred
to live in dirty, squalid homes. This was the speech of a beast,
a man devoid of all human feeling.

But this young businessman had held the same views in 1964
as he did in 1966. VVhy was it that only now he had suddenly
appeared on a national hook-up? For one thing, it is an expression
of the intensiﬁed activity and increased arrogance of the ultra-Right
in its efforts to build a grass-roots racist movement. Another thing
it indicates is a fear that the growing movement for democratic

3

 

pro-justice, and pro-goodwill. A commitment to build a great
democratic society for the enrichment of human personality
is far more elevating and far more lofty than setting ourselves
the task of destroying the enemies that disturb us.”

The most dramatic example of rejection by Negroes of this kind
of policy occurred when 75,000 Negroes in a park in Chicago
booed Dr. Jackson and prevented him from continuing a speech
opposing the March on Washington. Dr. Jackson may be the
nominal head of the largest body of organized Negroes in the
United States but the real leadership to which Negro Baptists are
responding can be found in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference headed by Reverend Martin Luther King, whose light
for integration is one which unites the main mass of the Negro
people with labor and all democratic forces in the country. This
tendency is representative of a growing and militant trend for
equality in the Negro people's movement.

Can there be any doubt as to which trend is in the interest
of the Negro people, of democracy? I think not.

National Pride vs. Nationalism

The question of petty-bourgeois nationalism in the Negro com-
munity must also be considered. The ghetto is the product of
enforced segregation imposed by capitalism. There are two main
developments that must be noted in this connection. On the one
hand there is nationalism which accepts this state of affairs and
uses it as a basis for the development of its program of self-suﬂiciency.
This trend stems from the Negro bourgeoisie whose program is
based upon the internal market of the ghetto. It is here that the
separatist ideas grow. This is a minority tendency in the Negro
movement.

At the same time there grows apace the whole idea of national
pride, and this must not be confused with petty-bourgeois national-
ism. The growth of national pride is an expression of the new
level of consciousness in the struggle against segregation which
combines a recognition of the special problems of the ghetto with
a recognition of the imperative necessity for unity between Negro

30

 

I

.._.___j-

 

and white. It follows that the growth of this tendency cannot but
help to strengthen all efforts towards unity of the Negro people
in struggle.

The Communist Party and the Negro People

As can be seen, the ﬁght for the unity of the Negro people poses
many complex problems. To cope with these, the building of the
Communist Party is a matter of urgent necessity. For it is our Party
which can help to bring the necessary ideological and political
clarity to answer these many complex questions. That is why over
the last 20 years the forces of reaction have attempted to destroy
the Communist Party and isolate it from the struggles of the Negro
masses. They know that the Negro people made their greatest
advances precisely when the Communist Party had its greatest
period of growth.

Today, moreover, successes being achieved in the ﬁght for the
legality of the Communist Party open up new opportunities for
building it. And the building of the Communist Party is in turn
the road to new victories of labor and the Negro people. Let us
undertake the mass building of our Party which will enable it to
fulﬁll its historic role in the ﬁght for peace, democracy and
socialism.

rights and for the equality of the Negro people may endanger his
lily-white sanctum. And he was also emboldened by the reactionary
racist war policy.

It is interesting to note that this man is a businessman and that
95 per cent of his business comes from Negroes. But the proﬁt
m-ade from the ghetto is siphoned off to help erect higher jim crow
walls around the lily-white neighborhood in which this man lives.
I am certain that the Negro people of Chicago will soon learn how
to apply the technique of boycott to change this shameful situation.

This Chicago businessman is not alone. There are also mem-
bers of the Johnson Administration, supporters of his war policy,
who likewise act in the interest of those who are opposed to the
rapid advance of the struggle for Negro equality. What are they
after? They are afraid that the struggle against tokenism, against
a gradualist policy will “go out of bounds,” will develop and be
transformed into a struggle all along the line for radical and
fundamental changes relating to the position of Negroes in America.

Consequently we ﬁnd an all-out attack against the growing
movement to bring about change. This attack is not only of
the Eastland type. It also comes from the so-called "liberals."

A Dangerous Trend

VVhat explains the new-found arrogance of the ultra-racists as
exempliﬁed in the performance of the white businessman from
Chicago of whom I have spoken? How was it possible for him to
be invited to spew out this venom in front of a national television
audience? Is there a relationship between this and the sudden
zeal of certain white liberals to “reform” the Congress of the United
States by attempting to expel from its ranks Adam Clayton Powell?
In my opinion there is such a relationship.

We must face up to the truth that since 1964 a certain change
has taken place in the national climate on the issue of Negro free-
dom. A section of the capitalist class which thought it could
pacify the civil rights movement by embracing it and offering it
minor concessions is now frightened at its inability to contain and
control this struggle.

This section of capital recognizes that the war in Vietnam means
less funds to combat poverty and ghetto blight, at a time when re-

4

 

i
I

 

 

peated ghetto outbursts speak eloquently of the urgent need for
massive funds and radical reforms to change meaningfully the
lot of the ghetto and slum poor.

It is this which explains the growing fear of a militant civil
rights movement. It is this which explains the way in which the
slogan “black power” has been consciously distorted by the capi-
talist press in order ‘to split the Negro people's movement and to
frighten white masses. And it is this which explains the Johnson
Administration’s betrayal of the open occupancy bill, the about-
face of the Supreme Court in the recent decision against mass
picketing, and the disgraceful fashion in which the Rockefeller
and O'Connor leaderships of both major parties in New York
helped scuttle the Civilian Review Board.

It is this new dangerous trend, accelerated by the war in Vietnam,
which has given new encouragement and a new lease on life to
the ultra-reactionaries and ultra-racists. This explains both the
arrogance of the businessman from Chicago and the actions of the
so-called white liberal congressman from Florida, Sam Gibbons,
who last October ﬁrst voiced the call for Adam Clayton Powell's
removal from the chairmanship of the House Education and Labor
Committee.

The Assault on Powell~—
Anti-Negro, Anti-Labor

Let me give you an example of how liberal phraseology disguises
a reactionary policy. Here is a quotation from a New York Times
editorial of December 2, 1966:

“Article I, Section 5, of the U.S-. Constitution grants to both
houses of Congress the power to be the judges of the qualiﬁcations
of their own members, to punish members for disorderly behavior
and to expel a member by a two-thirds vote.” The editorial ex-
plains how this is done, and then continues: “Representative Van
Deerlin [a fellow Democrat from California], has announced that
he will attempt to bar Mr. Powell from the House in the new Con-
gress. This is a sensible tactic.” It goes on to characterize Mr.
Powell as misrepresenting the Harlem district which “re-elected
him triumphantly by an overwhelming majority.”

There you have it. The New York Times becomes the ideologist

5

 


i
I

for the so-called liberal representatives of the Democratic Party
in ﬁghting against the democratic rights of the Negro. For ex-
ample, a two-thirds majority is required for expulsion. But by a
simple majority, they urge, you can exclude Congressman Powell
from taking his seat. It is easier to do this, suggests the New York
Times, and it greets the initiative taken in this case by Rep. Van
Deerlin.

No one is fooled by this. Yesterday it was a Floridian who chal-
lenged Powell’s chairmanship of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee. Today it is a so-called liberal from California challenging
his seat in the House.

It is interesting to note that a campaign is being waged against
one of the best known representatives of the Negroes not only in
Harlem but in the etnire country. In the eyes of this reactionary
gang-up Powell is an “uppity Negro.” He criticizes the Adminis-
tration’s policies. He must be silenced. But let there be no mistake
about this attack. It is not an attack on Powell alone. It is an at-
tack to prevent a change in Congress from a situation where there
are only six Negroes to one in which there are'——as there should be
-40 or 50 Negroes. This is warfare against any eﬁort to correct the
composition of the Congress of the United States. It is also warfare
against Powell’s leadership in the ﬁght against -anti-labor legislation.

V/Vhat is evident here is a simultaneous attack against the ﬁght
for equality of Negroes in the Congress of the United States, and
against the fight for progressive legislation which will serve the in-
terests of the working class as a whole. Misconduct is not the issue.
If it were, there are many others in Congress whom there would be
greater reason to remove. The defeat of this gang-up against Powell
will serve the interests of democracy in general and of the Negro peo-
ple in particular.'’‘‘

‘‘ Since this was written, Congressman Powell has been deprived of his
committee chairmanship, and of his seat in the House pending an investigation.
In these shameful acts a number of liberals in Congress not only joined, but
led, to their disgrace. Negro leadership of all shades of opinion has rallied
to Powell’s defense, recognizing in his ouster an attack against the entire Negro
peo le. They must be joined by organized labor and by decent Americans
in l walks of life in a campaign which will reverse these racist acts.

II. Labor-Negro Unity Against Racism

The ultra-Right developments represented by the businessman
from Chicago, the “liberal” Van Deerlins and the Dixiecrats are
not the only factors in this picture. There are also developing m-ass
movements in opposition to this course, movements which embrace
hundreds of thousands. This opposition is taking shape around
different aspects of the struggle for equality. Some are concerned
with the economic, others with the political, and still others with
the social front.

“White Backlash”-—Weapon of Reaction

The level of understanding of the totality of the problem and
its relationship to the general “struggle for democracy varies. None-
theless all of these actions move in the direction of unity for
equality, democracy and peace. This is to be seen in the new
currents within the labor movement which are helping to strength-
en the solidarity of Negro and white workers. And it is to be seen
in the growing struggles for unity within the Negro community
and for a strengthened alliance with the labor movement, and with
this for a growing unity with white democratic Americans in gen-
eral and with the peace movement in particular.

That is why the lessons of the November 1966 elections are so im-
portant. I am in full accord with Comrade Gus Hall's analysis
of the November elections and the conclusions drawn and presented
by him to this National Committee meeting. He vividly demon-
strated by many examples the fact that despite the complexity of
events the masses found ways of expressing their opposition to
Johnson's war policies and of reasserting their determination for
peace. At the same time he rejected the attempts of the ultras
and the apologists for the war policies to explain the poor showing
of the Johnson Administration as being due to a “white balck1ash.”
Here is how Comrade H-all put the question of the so-called white
backlash:

 

 

“We must reject the concept and the phrase of “backlash”
or “whip1ash." This concept is a weapon of reaction—of the
racists. It is a justiﬁcation for racism, because they say racism
is only a reaction to the so-called extremes of the civil rights
movement. It places the cause for this backward, 300-year-
old slave market concept on the struggle for civil rights. It is
a cover for all kinds of crimes.

I should like to elaborate further on this subject. “White back-
lash" is one of the key weapons in the hands of the ultra-Right in
its drive against democracy in this country, which begins with the
drive against the Negro people. “V/Vhite backlash” is a concept
which conceals the role of the monopolists as well as the role of the
ultra-Right. It is a concept intended to be a dagger in the heart
of the democratic struggle. It is a weapon against the trade union
movement in this country. It must be rejected and exposed for
what it is-—a weapon of reaction and fascism in this country.

No greater mistake could be made than to try to equate the con-
cept of “white backlash” with that of “bl-ack power." The ﬁrst
comes from the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, most war-
minded elements of ﬁnance capital; the other emerges from an
oppressed people ﬁghting for democracy and liberation from capi-
talist bondage.

Labor-—The Key Link

The need for correct strategic and tactical leadership is of great
concern and is being widely discussed on all levels of leadership
within the Negro people’s movement. The theory which guides
our Party—Marxism-Leninism—enables us to make a distinct con-
tribution to this discussion. This is an urgent requirement of the
moment. Why? Because of the danger on the one hand that the
new and positive developments in the labor movement can be dis-
sipated by a reactionary offensive aimed at splitting Negro and
white workers, and by the growth on the other hand of nationalist
separatist tendencies within the Negro people’s movement which
carry with them the concept of “no conﬁdence" in the labor move-
ment. The victory of either of these tendencies would be disas-
trous both for labor and for the Negro people.

8

 

 

It would also be fatal to conclude that new and militant develop-
ments in the struggle for Negro rights are possible only outside the
labor movement. This line of thinking can likewise be harmful
to a successful struggle for full equality. The problem of leader-
ship is to ﬁnd the road in militant struggle which can unite these
mass currents, which can deliver powerful blows for economic,
political and social equality.

The key link in the chain leading to accomplishment of such an
objective is the labor movement. In relation to the struggle of the
Negro people for economic, political and social equality, the Com-
munist Party must formulate a line of policy which will help to
strengthen their connections with the organized millions in this
country. For only the organized millions will determine the fate
of democracy and peace in our nation. Any other course would be
acceptance of a strategy which would separate us from the masses
precisely at that moment when the possibilities for making great
social advances are greater than ever before. That is why the new
developments must be seen in their totality—new developments in
all democratic movements and ﬁrst of all new developments in the
ranks of organized labor. \

It would be wrong in my opinion to view the New Left solely
as emerging from the middle-class and student forces in this coun-
try. The New Left is growing also within the labor movement,
and such a development is of decisive importance. For social forces
are emerging whose daily struggle against monopoly exploitation
gives special meaning to the present struggle. However, there are
varying degrees of consciousness. Comrade Gus Hall in his report
laid stress on three levels of movements now taking place: move-
ments for Negro-white unity within the labor movement and other
mass organizations; independent movements which may develop
outside of the established organizations but which create ties with
them based on minimum programs; and advanced movements for
unity which are based on programs with higher demands, and
which must, of course, also seek to maintain the greatest possible
contact with the mass organizations and movements. The quali-
tative improvement in the work of our Party in support of these
developments and in helping to guide them can help to galvanize
the millions at the grass roots.

What are we saying here? It is that democracy for all is possible
