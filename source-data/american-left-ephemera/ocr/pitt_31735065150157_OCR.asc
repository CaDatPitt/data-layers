DENVER—Delegates to Mine-Mill’s 55th convention
at the Cosmopolitan Hotel here Aug. 29-Sept. 1 took a
long, hard look at the problems they face as workers
in the non-ferrous metals industry, citizens of the nation
and members of the world community-—and came up
— with -a wide variety of answers for solving them.
I It was a serious convention, packed into four days
of hard work deliberately scheduled without the usual
array of guest speakers, entertainment or frills. It got
"- down to business even before the first session convened,

,_with meetings of the Phelps Dodge and A_S&R councils
;on Sunday, the day before the official opening.

$5tI1 Convention Adops

   

 

  Platform Phufos...

The Convention’s key-
note was set by President
Clark in his opening annual
report of the officers in which
he expressed great pride in the
fact that while the months
since the last convention were
exceedingly difficult for the
union, they have proven once
more that Mine-Mill “is still
the only union capable of wag-
ing a successful fight for the

interests of the non-ferrous .

‘metals workers.”

This was attested to, Clark
added, by the fact that “in a
period when several larger
and wealthier unions suffered
defeats, our membership
fought and won the longest na-

tion-wide strike in the history

of the industry.”
,From then on the conven-
tion settled down to commit-

: tee work, discussion and action

on the floor on issues ranging
from job security to foreign
affairs.

It was in the conv-ention-ap-
pointed committees, consider-
ing some fifty resolutions sub-
mitted by local unions and the
International Executive Board,

where the “guts” of the meet,"

ing’s actions were formulated
for rank and file decision in
the traditional “Mine-Mill wayi’
of establishing union policy
and program.
>Z= >l= 
I IUPPERMOST in the minds
of the delegates was the con-
dition of the industry in which
they work and its relation to
the general economic situation

 throughout the country.

Of special concern were dis-
turbing trends which ’ have
been resulting in shrinkage of
jobs and displacement of men

_ Lthrough the growth of speed-

up devices, mechanization and
automation in this as well as
other - industries. ' '

Their deliberations on this
over’-riding problem were final-
ized in two major resolutions
which projected programs for
the non-ferrous metals indus-
try and general objectives for
future bargaining.

Special Session of Congress
in Key Legislation

Bats Zero

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Newspaper headline Writers have described the'86th Con-
gress special session, which adjourned as Mine-Mill’s 55th convention was still meeting,

in numerous ways. They said it accomplish ed. nothing in the way of legislation which-

labor termed vital. »They said the bobtail Congress was a “fiasco,” a “bust;” that it

“laid a goose egg.”

A All the descriptions were
accurate of the singular
lack of accomplishment pro-
duced out of the high-falutin’
campaign 0 r a t o r y which
gushed from the e1ection-mind-
ed hopefuls of both parties.

3 >k

EVEN before the do-noth-I
ing, four-week extra session of I

the 86th Congress closed up

shop on Sept. 2, the leaders of
both parties were giving out
political post-mortems —- of the
whys and wherefores. of their
big flop on “must” legislation.

Democratic presidential can-
didate Kennedy blamed Repub-
licans for blocking minimum
wage, aid to education, hous-

ing and health bills. Republi-
cans, including President
Eisenhower and presidential
candidate- Nixon, replied that
the Democrats controlled two-
thirds of both the House and
Senate and still were unable to
agree on any important legis-
lation. I \

However the blame may be
assessed, the results of the
politically-motivated extra ses-

;sion areindisputable. ,Of the

five key measures listed for
action, not one was cleared for
presidential signature.
THESE measures, listed by
Senators John Kennedy and
Lyndon Johnson as the pro-
gram to which they intend to
devote their “full energies”

‘during the special session,
were:

1. Medical care for the aged
within the framework of social
security.

2. A compromise aid to edu-
cation proposal.

3. Expanded federal aid for
housing.

4. A modernized minimum
wage law, with a $1.25 mini-
mum and expansion of cover-
age to service and retail trades.

5. Legalization of common-
site picketing by building
trades unions.

When the wrangling was
over, the main welfare projects
which supposedly provided the
reason for the special session

asic Steps
roblems

DENVER—A basic,
long-range and many-sided
approach toward ultimate
solution of the domestic
non-ferrous minerals in-

dustry’s problems was spelled .

out by thedelegates here in
one of the major resolutions
adopted by the 55th conven-
tion.

.. The proposed measures, ad-
vocated by the union for
years, include the following
important programs aimed at
promoting long-range growth’
and stability of the industry:

1. Expanded world-wide utili-.

zation of metals in the rapid
economic growth of the
world’s underdeveloped areas.

This, the convention said,
should be promoted with
greatly expanded aid through
the United Nations and other
international agencies to
which the United States be-
longs.

2. Negotiation of interna-'
tional commodity agreements ‘V
in copper, lead and zinc, with ‘

a View to stabilizing produc-
tion and _ regulating trade to
prevent excessive imports.
The resolution noted that a
promisiing beginning in this
direction, supported by Mine-
Mill, has been made in lead

and zinc through the UN, and i

urged that it be strengthened
and broadened to include cop-
per.

3. Expansion of world trade
through broadening of the Re-
ciprocal Trade program and
rem oval of restrictions on
U. S. exports of metals and

,metal products.

Such trade, in order to be
large enough to be significant,
must be without restrictions or
qualifications as to the type

‘of government or economic

systemswith which the U. S.
deals, the resolution pointed
out.

“UNTIL these p r o g r a m s
and greater economic prog-
ress at home can be achieved,”
the delegates declared, “we
have worked and will continue
to Work, in consultation with
our Canadian membership, for

Tacoma Scores in

Arbitration Awards

Three important arbitration
awards were won recently by
Local 25, Tacoma, Washing-
ton. In each case the union
was represented by Attorney
John Caughlan.

In a case heard by Arbitra-
tor J. B. Gillingham, Univer-
sity of Washington, the union
grieved over the payment of
straight time to G. H. K’Burg
for working the day shift

- after having worked the day

shift the previous day, and

. the following graveyard shift.

The graveyard shift and the
following day shift covered
sixteen hours of continuous
work.

The arbitrator held the com-
pany had violated the agree-
ment by paying straight time
for the work following the
graveyard shift. ‘

Another case h.eard by Arbi-
trator Norman A. Stoll upheld
the union in its contention
that use of a short tip bolted
tothe boom of a Coles crane
is an extension within the
meaning of the contract re-
quiring operation of the crane
by a qualified Yard Depart-
ment operator on a cla.'ss'12

Anti—Labor
Legislation

DENVER —,“The Landrum— A

Griffin law is one of the most
flagrantly discriminatory
pieces of class legislation that
ever went through our Con-y

gressional procedures,” a reso"-' '
lution on anti-labor legislation —,
- adopted by the ' ‘

convention . de-
clared. \ . '

The delegates called for the. L

election to Congress of legis.

lators “who will vote to repeal

the iniquitous Landrum-Grif-
fin and Taft-Hartley laws.”
which, they said, “block _the

growth and legitimate aspira-— ~ 

tions of the labor movement.”
Also urged was a labor of-

fensive for seeking repeal of.

.“right-to-work” laws in some
20 states where they are pres-
ently on the books as well as
increased vigilance to prevent

enactment of similar laws in-
other states.

“T-HE BULK of the Land- ‘ H
rum-Griffin law,” the resolu-.

tion said, “is just a plain crack-

down on labor unions, severely ' I
limiting their rights to-organ-‘
ize, to strike, to picket, and to '

carry out their regular activi-
ties.”

“Never before,” it said, “has ‘i .
Congress attempted to so mi- ‘
nutely regulate the day-to-day I

operations of any other insti-
tution as it has here done in
the case of labor unions.”

It also hit at the labor con-
trol law’s bans on secondary
boycotts and “hot cargo”
clauses which “seriously ham-
per any effective union action
to prevent the growing prac-

tice of ‘subcontracting,’ where- .

by employers can evade their
obligation to maintain union

standards by contracting-out 

work to non-union firms.”

 Negotiations Urged

To End Cold War

DENVER——Continued negotiations among the ’
V‘world’s great powers to end the cold war and ease inter-

national tensions was urged by the 55th convention dele-
gates in a resolution which declared that there is no al-
ternative to peace except the destruction of mankind on

earth.

The resolution noted that
“the cold war‘ continues de-
spite an almost universal cry
for peace and the knowledge
that another world war would
mean the end of human life on

EMPHASIZING that “all
this points to the terrible
urgency of bringing the cold
war to an end,” the convention
statement added that belliger-
ent currentsin the atmosphere

talks “are tending to increase
the momentum of the cold war

rr CONTINUED: “Everyp

possible avenue must be _ex-

plored and explored again in.j

the search for a common pro-
gram for the ending of the
cold war and a positiveipro-
gram for peace, disarmament,‘

the ending of nuclear ‘testing '

and stockpiling, and a united
world-wide attack on the prob-
lems of human poverty in
both theadvanced and under-

developed countries of the
, world.” ‘
In this latter connection,

the convention called for a
more accurate judgment by
the U. S. of “the urgency and
immediacy of the aspirations

of the peoples in the under- _

developed areas of the world
for political independence and

An end to the cold war, the ‘
resolution" said, “requires rec- '

some say in the ordering of
their own economic affairs.”

“It is only through the ful-
fillment o-f these aspirations-
the only route" to economic
growth——that a lasting solu-
tion to world economic and
political tensions and to the
problems of the non-ferrous
metals industry can be found,”
the resolution said.

THE DELEGATES CALLED
on the administration taking
office next January-, “to seek
a resumption of the canceled
summit meetings that
achieve a ban on further nu-
clear tests, relaxation of trade
and diplomatic_ relations be-
tween the countries of the
East and West, procedures for

“Al1 locals should initiate
the widest possible joint activ-

port urged. “On the ‘national
level, our International Union
must make itself heard in Con-
gress and elsewhere in sup-

IN ADDITION, the program

enumerated “other contract

tiveness of such measures.”

Listed high among these‘

made in Kennecott on this
problem and must be extended

Report Links Bargaining 2- 

Plans to Political Action

DENVER—Along with its formulation of major bargaining - ‘x 

perspectives for 1961, the Wage and Contract report adopted by
the convention closely linked the outcome of next year’s negoti-x

ations with the political action achievements of the union.

“The nature of these future demands and the climate in
which future bargaining will" take place are now being shaped
by developing political and- economic trands,” the report pointed
out. “Foremost among these trends are the ‘crackdown on labor’.
attitude of large employers, as symbolized by the repressive-

Landrum-Griffin bill, and the growing job insecurity of Ameri-

can workers in this and other industries.” A
Underscoring the necessity for coupling preparations for the

bargaining table with political activity to assure that contract. 
gains are not negated by labor-crippling legislation, the report ~

went on:

25 * =14 ,
“WHAT WE achieve by way of political action in the next few
months—-especially in the kind of Congress that we elect—will
have an important effect on both the atmosphere of our future

economic needs of our members.”

It noted that “many of the problems faced by American

workers cannot be solved at the bargaining table alone,” and
also made the point that constructive collective bargaining can-
not occur “under laws and underan administration that restrict ~

and hamper labor unions in their normal activities and encour- 

age employer hostility and resistance.”

In this regard the report maintained‘ that “our own long
strike last year and the current bitter Coeur d’Alene strike in
Idaho were as much a product of the McClellan Committee and
the Landrum-Griffin law as they were of the economic issues

underlying these disputes.”

And it drew the conclusion that “these unwholesome legis-
lative trends underscore the need for more conscious and more
intensive political activity by all of labor.”

Union Fights for Mine Safety

DENVER——Continued concentration of Mine—Mill’s efforts to improve safety and
health conditions in the non-ferrous metals industry was stressed in a resolution on‘

mine safety voted by the convention delegates.
While supporting the revision of state mine sa

less emphasized that “experience has shown conclusively that action that can be

taken at the state level is
no substitute for a uniform
federal mine ‘safety code,
backed and enforced with the
full power of the federal gov-
ernment.”

Tothat end, the convention
called for “the early enactment
of the Federal Mine Safety bill
which our union has advocated
for many years.”

The resolution noted that

such a bill was reintroduced

by Senator Murray and Con-
gressman Metcalf during the
86th Congress, but was not
called up for a vote. It said
that a factor in the inaction of
Congress “was the fact that
the silicosis study in metal
mining by the ‘Public Health

Service was well on its way to .

completion.” ‘
I _s:=- :1: _ ac

ated through -Mine-Mill's ef-

health hazards, and strongly
urged enactment of a non-fer-

law. These efforts resulted in
a special appropriation for the
silicosis study by Congress last
year. -

Completion of the study
should lay a further factual
basis for pushing for enact-
ment of Mine-Mill's safety bill,
the resolution said.

The need for such federal
legislation, the r e s 0 l u t i o n
pointed out, is seen in the fact
that most state mining safety
codes, with few exceptions,
“are in the nature of museum
pieces, with little practical ef-
fects on actual operations."

CERTAIN improvements
over existing laws, while not
entirely satisfactory to the

“ AT ABOUT the same time,

a revenue bill, which would
have substituted -higher tariffs
for lead-zinc import quotas,
failed in the Senate.

mously approved a resolution
calling for an adequate sup-
port program for lead and zinc,
and condemning the Edmond-
wson bill as “a fraud and a
hoax.”
“It limits benefits only to

THE MINE-MlLL‘ UNION

I October.

DENVER —— Two resolutions

. in support of other unions un-

Mine - Mill convention. T h e y
concerned t h e monitorship
straight-jacket imposed on the
Teamsters union and the in-
famous union-busting drive Of
the N e w h o u s e newspaper
chain against the International

. Typographical Union in Port-
land, Oregon.

 ‘All sections of labor were

lpfnprged to unite behind efforts

for passage of the Kasem-Lane
“:bill"introduced in Congress to
prohibit federal courts ‘ or

e " court-appointed monitors from

running the affairs of labor

‘ unions contrary to present law-

The Kasem-Lane resolution ‘
warned that the federal district.

- tors to control the Internation-

“establishes a precedent which,
'if not over-ruled, will consti-
tute a serious threat to the in-

IT POINTED out that the

from holding conventions and
electing its own leadership.

maintaining the monitors.

the monitorship device is
clear,” the statement con-
tinued. “If the power of the
‘courts is not checked, there is
nothing to prevent the exten-
sion of this type of undemo-
cratic, tyrannical control and
supervision to other sections
of organized labor and to other
‘institutions in our society.”

THE CONVENTION also
joined with all of labor in of-
~ fering full support to the fight
of the ' International Typo-
graphical Union involving the
lockout by the Newhouse news-

’ , paper chain's Portland “Ore-

gonian” ' and “Oregon Star”

against the ITU printers.
Over 800 ITU members have

been locked out since last No-

Two years ago the delegates had to come" into Denver for the 53rd convention in '

Resolutions‘ .

Cover Wide’

Issue Range  

DENVER—Some 50 resolu-
tions covering a wide range of
issues were submitted to the
Denver convention from locals
and the International Execu-
tive Board for consideration
by the various committees
which then made recommen-
dations for delegate action on
the floor. - -

These major actions are re-
ported in separate stories.
throughout this paper. Among
other subjects covered were
resolutions on labor unity, In-
dian affairs, rural electrifica-

tion, national land policy and

school lands.
On labor unity, the dele-

gates reaffirmed previous con- 7

vention decisions to seek
achievement of unity “;on‘com-
mon objectives wherever pos-
sible with other international-
unions,’f and instructed the Ex-
ecutive ,Board “to continue
an unrelenting struggle for

unity of our union with the_-

rest of the labor movement.”
* II: *

IN THE field of Indian af-
fairs, the convention pointed
out that Mine-Mill has among,
its membership large numbers
of Indian" people, many of ’
Whose families still live on
reservations supposedly un-
der the sovereign jurisdiction

,of elected tribal councils. .
The resolution put the con-.-

vention on record reaffirming
support of the U. S.‘ Senate
policy resolution which would
reverse the policy of terminat- ‘
ing our government’s ‘treaties
with the sovereign Indian na-
tions so as to guarantee the
continuation of such aids as
med_ical and educational serv-

Viices in addition to the means
‘of preserving Indian self gov.
‘ernment and culture. '

The new Indian policy reso.
lution backed by the union
would also preserve the gov;

'ernment’s obligation to de- ,-
velop the reservation lands-

and ‘- resources on a self-sus-

taining basis, instead of sell-" ’

ing these lands to monopoly

‘ industrial interests.

* >11 4‘ V

 

JOINT action with“ the

Farmers Union,
Councils ‘and the Sportsmen’s'
orgamzatlons in support of

proposals for a national land S

policy was also approved in’
another resolution which
Warned that big business and
the investment banks are driv-
ing more and more in the di-
rection of corporate agricul--
ture. ’ ~
The resolution opposed’ this

economic development as cal-. ‘D
culated to drive the f a mi 1 y-_~ =

people, as well as action calcu-"L ' *
lated to‘ hand over the forest F 

reserves and recreation al
areas - to corporate; interests.

Preparation of a suitable

pamphlet was called for by
the convention to set forth the
history and potential of ‘lands
granted to the states for the
support of schools. Such po-
tential income for‘ the support
of school systems would light-
en the burden of heavy taxa-
tion levied on the people for
that purpose, the resolution
pointed out. _
In another action, the con-

vention, observing, that the in- *

creased use of copper and cop-
per products is dependent in
large measure on the amount

of low-cost electric power"

which may be available to the

people, urged that Mine-Mill’

convention resolved:

“That all Mine-Mill local un-

the passage of adequate civil
rights legislation which will
give all American first class

civil rights _leader in Alabama,
“in his effort to regain his vot-
ing rights which were unlaw-
fully taken away from him.”

Calling for an educational
program to be set up in each
district of the International for
dissemination of civil rights
information ‘to local unions,
the convention further urged
solicitation of voluntary con-
tributions from the local mem-
berships to help support the
civil rights educational pro-
grams, court battles and stu-
dent lunch-counter demonstra-
tions throughout the South.

Approved as well by the
convention was “participation
in the peaceful picketing and
boycotting of the northern
Woolworth and Grant stores in
protest against their southern
‘Jim Crow’ lunch-counter pol-
icies.”

CIVIL LIBERTIES

In a resolution on civil liber-
ties, the delegates stated that
the rights of labor are funda-
mental and basic to expanding
democracy and an improved
life, warning at the same time

that “laws such as the'Land-

rum-Griffith act and other
‘labor reform’ acts are restric-
tive legislation interfering with
the rights of unions to bargain
effectively.” ‘ ‘

“Restrictive legislation lim-

iting the right to speak, think. if

and engage in political action‘  i I’

.weakens the fight of labor topfl

out.

It called for unity of all la- in

said, “has fought against every

The convention went on rec- ’

'ord commending the resolu-

tion introduced by Cong.

James Roosevelt in the House I

Thirteen fatal accidents in

THE CONFERENCE then
broke up into five working
committees to bring forth sug-

mining code and other recom-'

mended measures.

Regional Director Barraza
was named chairman of one
of the five working commit-
tees.

The recommendations of all

mediate measures for promot-

many-sided approach toward
improving the plight of the do-

dustry both in relation to
world-wide and home condi-
tions.

On future bargaining, the

' wage and contract committee’s

report adopted by the conven-
tion ranked the fight for jobs

' and for greater job security as
“the major issue facing the

entire American labor move-
ment today.” It set forth some
basic objectives for next year’s’
which will ‘ be
concretized into specific de-
mands at the 1961 Tucson con-
vention.

Both actions were closely
linked with a third major res-
olution spelling out goals in a
national legislative and politi-
cal action program to stimu-
late the general economy, pro-
mote production and employ-
ment, and advance the secur-
ity of all the nation’s people.
Realization of the union’s pro-
grams for the industry and
bargaining were coupled with
proposed political action in the
communities, state legislatures
and the national Congress.

ONE of t h e convention’s
most controversial discussions,
testifying to the traditional de-

mocracy. of the union, was the —

floor debate on an increase in
per capita .and strike fund.

In a spirit of mutual con-
cern for the union’s welfare,
delegate after delegate took
the floor to give his views. The
debate was finally resolved
with general agreement on the
need of the union for‘ more
money, but that because of

the heavy inroads made by the.

strike on local finances, more
time was necessary -to prepare
the locals and the general
membership for a referendum
vote on the increase.

While the question of in-
creased per capita and strike
fund was referred to the 1961
Tucson convention next March,
the delegates at the same time
called on all local unions “to
g i v e serious consideration
Where necessary to adjusting
their local union dues struc-
ture to provide for increased
per capita and strike fund al-
lotment following next year’s
convention.”

OTHER important actions of
the delegates were contained
in resolutions on support of
the Coeur d’Alenes strike, civil
rights and liberties, peace, un-
ion defense, anti-labor legisla-
tion, mine safety, and other
subjects covered by separate
stories in this issue of the
Mine-Mill Union. '

Before adjourning, the dele-

gates voted to hold the 1962
convention in Toronto, On-
tario.

sought primarily to salvage
the minimum wage measure.

The final battle on this is-
sue took place in a conference
committee charged with recon-
ciling a bare-bones House bill
with a more liberal Senate
measure.

The House version would
have raised the minimum for
workers presently covered to
$1.15, and would have brought
an additional 1.4 million per-
sons under the law’s protec-
tion although only with a $1
minimum and without over-
time protection.

The Senate bill would have
boosted the minimum to $1.25
over a 3-year period and‘ ex-
tended coverage for both
wages and hours» to about 4
million workers.

THE CONFERENCE com-
mittee, a duplicate of the
group which last summer pro-
duced the Landrum-Griffin
bill, was dominated by a ma-
jority of Republicans and
Dixiecrats. During a week of
negotiations, the Dixiecrat-Re
publican coalition hung tough
on the position that the com-
mittee could take the House
bill “or else.” ‘

With no prospect of a com-
promise, Senator Kennedy fi-
nally permitted wage-hour leg-
islation to die, declaring he

would go to the people with
the story of how it was scut-
tled and promising to “come
back. and try” for a meaning-
ful bill next January.

Burial of the minimum wage
measure was one of a series
of demonstrations that the fa-
miliar Dixiecrat - Republican
coalition was in full command
during the session. The power
wielded by this right wing
coalition was particularly evi-
dent in the House Rules Com-

mittee.
>l< =l< >l¢

FOUR conservative Repub-
licans and two Southern Dem-
ocrats used this strategic unit,
which controls the flow of leg-
islation, to decide what should
or should not be done.

The worst setback in the.

Senate at the hands or the

coalition came on the medical _

care issue. Here, a near solid
line-up of Southern Democrats
teamed up with Republicans to
vote down the Social security
principle in‘ favor of expand-
ing existing charity aid.

This was regarded not only
as an embarrassing act of de-
fiance toward the ‘basic plank
in the Democratic platform,
but also a cold-shouldering of
Lyndon Johnson, who was ex-

pected to draw some strength‘ ‘

behind the Forand bill.

The statement referred to

the fact that “this, approach ,

has since been borrowed by
other unions seeking to have
it applied to commodities in

which they have been inter-.

ested.”

ures the union has supported.

REPEATING s uch more
immediate aims which the
union has advocated as a solu-
tion for the industry’s chronic
problems, the delegates called
for:

Import quotas for lead and
zinc allocated so as to give
preferential treatment to im-
ports f r o in countries with
adequate wage standards.

This approach would not
only stabilize internation trade
in thesemetals, but would en-
courage the elevation of wage
standards in important coloni-

stockpiling of.

.al and semi—colonial sources of
supply.

Areas bill, as introduced by

Illinois’ Senator Douglas and ,

President Eisenhower.

AT THE same time, the con-

vention reaffirmed the union’s
position of continued support
to lead-zinc price support pro-
grams “which would extend
to the entire industry and thus
help to provide jobs for addi-

tional lead-zinc miners and

smeltermen.” .
Greatly increased federal
aid in geological mapping
and exploration for new de-
posits of minerals was also
endorsed in the program,
along with expanded research

in techniques for exploitation

of low-grade ore deposits and
further uses of non-ferrous
metals. ’
