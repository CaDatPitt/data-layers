To the Editor:

The people of British Columbia can I

wellquestion the attitude of members

' of the various political parties of the

House of Commons, when. they read
that there are mines shutting down
and in others lay-offs of miners and
mill workers t-aking place because
these jobs are being lost in-gold mines
and lately in base metal mines. ,
Why?" It is not because the ore
bodies are depleted or that there is no
market. As far as gold is concerned
there always is a market. Every ounce
of gold produced, can be ‘sold. The oft
repeated"reason given by those that
would cover up the situationis that
we are pricing ourselves out of the
market when they read about lay-offs
and shut downs. ,
Such an explanation is certainly
wrongand to explain the situation in
gold mines, it is «simply ridiculous.
Here it is, a direct case of the policy
of the government of Canada which

. is directly responsible. They are in-

sisting that Canada produce gold and
sell it at a‘ price fixed by the United
States Treasury Department -which
maintains the price set, in 1935 and

which is recognized as being sold at.

half price. '

We are accepting American dollars *
“which the United States government

itself says are only worth halflof what
they were at the time that the price
of gold was pegged.

In -thiscsection of the.mining.indus-
try the wages of the miners are low
and the constant fear of shut-down is
the threatthat has kept these 1/pining

communities on sub—standard wages '
H and conditions.

The attempt to bring in immigrant
labor and use it as cheap labor to over-
.come . the situation, has of course
flopped. , ' '

But even with the depressed wages
as the_American dollar continues to
decline in value and costs are increas-
ing, the mine operators who refuse
to operate without making a profit
while at the same time depleting their

reserves, say that the Canadian gov-.
, gernment will sell to the American gov-

ernment gold at half price. _
‘Why does the Canadian government

allow this situation to continue? Why‘

does the Canadian government take out

of the public treasury fifteen million

dollars on an average per year to con-

a question that should be asked of
every member of the House of Com-
mons. On them rests the responsibility.

The delegation‘ of citizens that are
going to Ottawa next month rnust'in-
sist upon’ direct answers. Forty thou-

pstand "Canadian ‘people are involved.

Whole ‘mining communities face the
danger. The demand must be made on
the Canadian government for a change
in policy. " , _

If gold mining is unnecessary to the
economy of the country,‘ let the gov-

‘ -ernment say so and take the responsib-
, ility and not place the burden upon

, the working men and have the fear.
«of unemployment hanging over the
_"-heads of our people and wlfole com-

munities facing a future as ghost

' ‘towns. \

Up to very recently there “has been

" zbig expansion in ._the production of base

mietals because the price of metals on

~ the world market has been going up.
I Now the price is falling, there appears
‘ "to be a surplus of lead, zinc lnd—cop-

.per ‘but this also is an artificial sur-
plus, ‘ ’

Here again there is a tremendous
world market for these base metals.
Here the Dominion government, also
;at the insistence of the United States,
is refusing to ‘allow Canadian metal
.-producers to sell the metals to coun-
tries that are crying for them.

By insisting that metals can only be
sold on the dollar exchange and a com-
.plete embargo against the sale of these
metals to ‘the countries in, eastern Eu-
Irqpe, and China because» there is no

who crisis i BC. incls?

senting mining constituencies

    

trade allowed. No export permits are
issued.

This is a shortsighted policy. First
of all, because it is destroying trade
with countries that want to trade with
us. Secondly," the embaitgo is a flop

because they can develop -other produc- -

tion and they are.

A It hurts us. It makes Canada com-
pletely dependent upon the United
States market and there the United
States government places tariffs
againstCanadian metal production

when it. hurts their economy, While the,
_ United States government spends mil-
alions of dollars in —developing base

metal production in South Ar’nerica
and in Africa, where they can exploit
native labor to produce cheaply.

O

In British Columbia we have very
rich deposits of these metals. They can

be mined prbfitably and there is a
great demand for our production if
Canada will trade with all Nations that
wish to trade with us and not be ‘de-
pendent upon the United States.

The British Trade Union Congress
has recently gone on record and com-
pelled the British government to open
up trade with the countries of eastern
Europe. and with China. A special
agency has been established in Britain
to develop trade.

Over eleven hundred firms are nowl
trading with these countries, while r

here in B. C., on the insistence of the
Dominion government, mines are being

-shut down’ and men laid off. This is

not only true of base metals, it is also
true of lumber. and fishing. ‘'

The crisis that is developing in B. C., 2

and Canada is fostered by the _Domin_-
ion government.
0 .

The Mine, Mill and Smelter Work-
ers’ Union is urging. a change in this
policy in B. C.," in order to provide a
good living,»not only to our present

population but to a greatly increased.

population if _realistic and protracted
policies were pursued by our govern-
ment and Canada’s interests placed
first. V , '

We are advocating that there be con-
tinued expansion of‘ the base metals.
The world needs our production to ad-
vance to a better life that‘-would do
more than anything else to remove the

_ ‘I fear of war.. '
tinue to sell gold at half. price. This is ' i

We are advocating that the govern-
mentencourage the development of a
custom smelter that could handle.the
tonnage from small mines who are at
present restricted because of smelter

, capacity. ,

We wish the ,peo,.ple'l in all areas in
Br-i=ti'sh Columbia to bring pressure

upon the Federal government ‘for’
changes. Mining is B.C.’s second larg-

est industry.

This province cannot develop lwith-
out a healthy metal mining industry.
This industry can provide a good liv-
ing tothe men and women employed
and dependent upon it. It has no chance
if the present. policies of the govern-

ment .are- continued. : .

. To the Editor:

The Spanish Inquisition was brought
about ’by those who wished to rule
without opposition, for their own sel-
fish gains. This was done by placing‘.
the fear of God into the hearts of_ all
who disagreed with the royalty of that
age. -It seems now that the Inquisition
is back, right here in America, in the
form of'the McCarran Committee. \‘

McCarran represents the ganibling

syndicates of Nevada,,the silver and
copper barons, and the big sheep and
cattle ranchers. His-so-called “inves-

. tigation” of our Union is to try to‘
make us change our policies to can,
form with McCarran and the.‘ big moneys?

character was. And where --he did for-
get his. lines the Committee was quick
to prompt’ him. ,

This sell-out artist accuses’ our Un-
ion of following a Communist policy.

, Well, our Union was one of the first

to. say, “Let us have peace.” For that,
Murray, Reuther and their. ilk red-
‘baited us and kicked \us out of CIO.

ting to holding a, Inult/itude of jobs,

union card inthe Newspaper Guild for
12 years! If you—were ready to be-
lieve’that, he went: on to tell the most
atrocious lieiof all-—and of course the
Committee swallowed it whole as "long
as it helped to smear our Union. His
story wasthat a“ copper ‘strike was
called in" 1950 to slowdown the flow
of arms’ to Korea. The truth is, of

' -course, that thvere ' -wags, no <str‘i'ke‘ in

1950—and the 10-day strike in ‘1951
was called only after the industry re-
fused to accept the Federal Govern-
ment’s own proposal for a wage set-
tlement, which our Union" had already

L agreed to. As‘ simple as that.

It was obvious the Committee was
only interested in trying to" smear and

 trap people. Just try to-answer ques-

tions -which are framed the way they
frame r them, without the chance to
make a statement, and you will esee

 how easy it is to incriminate~you1-self.

‘That.’ is what McCarran is waiting for.

We membersof Mine, Mill, in order

was signed, November 1 between Mine-
Mill Local 552 and Stamford Rolling
Mills C0. It provides for an across—the-
board increase of 10 cents an hour.

creased to $3 and $5.'This is in addi-
tion to a complete insurance program.
which is"fully paid for by the company.

The hot roll operators and helpers
received an additional 10 cents an hour
whichwas added to their basic rate,
doing away with a 5 cents per hour

A “bonus,” paid: only when the rolls op-
iterated. Three weeks vacation with pay
‘ for all 15 year men was also added.

The addition of a seventh paid holiday
culminated the signing of a, contract
which runs to November 1, 1953.
"The negotiators were Edward H.
Coleman, Pres.; Anthony Davis, V.
Pres.; Walter Jenkins, Rec. Sec.; Ralph
Lupo, Fin. Sec.; Monye Myers, Mich-
ael’ Zone, James Rush and Irving Dich-
ter, Regional Director. The negotiating

V As a result of, the um'on’s research
into, the latest treatments used in. .
major medical colleges for silicosis and
other lung diseases, the membership
at the last‘meeting heard a lecture by

ll/Ir. V. R. Bennett of Los Angeles,
medical consultant on matters dealing
with lung diseases, who demonstrated

his ‘pressure breathing machine, the

latest invention used by leading eastern
medical institutions in treatment of
silicosis. Dumng his three-day stay in
Butte, Mr. Bennett also metwith lead-.
ing doctors prominent for their under--I

standing of lung conditions, to whom _

he demonstrated the machine and
donated one to the St. James hospital
for test use. From all indications the H
pressure machine will prove .hz'ghly suc-, -
ccssful in alleviating much suffering-
on the part of d silicotic, and the union .
is now worlcing \,to' the end -that all
groups, the union, management and
medical authorities move to have the
machine establl'shed‘at Galen and at

various hospitals, ‘available to miners.

/ ‘AFTER the Canadian Parliament re-

convenes this month there will
come before the House of Commons the
most undemocratic and anti-Union
legislation ever introduced in Canada.
—At the instigation of the  S. State
»Department, the Canadian govern-
ment‘ has had the Criminal Code re-
vamped in such_ a manner that it will
embody the KU. S. Smith Act, McCar-

  threatens   Cena

ran Act and all other anti-Union 1eg- ,

islation that can be rounded up.

A Under the cover ofA.Bill H-8_are hid-
A .denApropos_ed/ sections. These. sections

if passed can make striking punishable .

by A ten years’ imprisonment, with .a
further five years for picketing. The
rights of transportation and" utility

workers wil’ be practically’ eliminated. .'

A A Section 49' of the proposed Bill H-8
reads as follows: ~

1. Everyone who does a prohibited —

actrfor a purpose prejudicial to (a) the
safety or interests of Canada, or (b)
the safety or security of . the, naval,
army or air forces of anyrstate other
A than Canadathat arelawfully present
in Canada, is guilty_'of an indictable of-
fense andis liable to imprisonment for
tenyears- AA ‘ A ‘A 
A 2. In this section, “prohibited act”
means an act or omission that (a) im-
pairs the efficiency 'or impedes the

working of any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, A

machinery, apparatus or‘ other -thing,
or (b) causes property, by whomso-
ever it may be owned, to be lost, dam-
aged or destroyed. A

IN READING section 49 it is quite A
. evident what such _legislation -is de-=

signed for. Workers -Acould not possibly
‘ be on strike without] impairing the ef-.

ficiency or impeding the workings of

either machinery or apparatus and

more especially. “other thing.”

builds labour temple,

PORT COLBORNE, Ont.—It is a far
cry from the days of 1948-49, when
Mine—Mil1 Local 637 was raided by the
Steelworkers. Today the united mem-
bership of Local 637 has embarked on
building a Labour Temple second to
none in the Niagara Peninsula.

' The cost of constructingdshis home
for the Port Colborne workers is $50,-
000—for the first stage. The hall, when
completed, will cost over $100,000. It
will be one of the largest halls in the
area, but the members feel that it is
very necessary so that activities of
various forms can be accommodated-

The Labour Temple when completed
will have an audit_o1"ium to seat 750 to
800 people, ‘stage to present concerts
and stage perfornrances. There will be
reading and lounging. room, as well as
a fully equipped kitchen, offices for
the staff and committee rooms.

As it is anticipated that this Labour
Temple will be the centre of all organ-

Aized labour in Port'Colborne, there will

be office space for those organizations
that wish to avail themselves of this

opportuiiity. It will be ready for open-

ing next spring.

"To the Editor:

2 This is myfirst attempt at writing
to any paper,.and if the effort runs a.
bit -one-sided pleasejexcuse me be-
cause I have not had much practice or

experience at this sortof thing.
But to get down to brass tacks, after .

reading the last issue of THE UNION

CI was both surprised and shocked to

‘read some of the questions put_ to of-

ficers ofour union and some ‘of the
answers they received from Sen.‘ Pat

McCarran, namely the testimony of. Al
Skinne'r7‘when Senator McCarran an-‘
swered him that he did not care about
the Supreme Court. I would like? to
answer Senator McCarran "through the
medium of our paper with the follow-
ing paragraph from one of the speech-

.es President Lincoln made , in Balti-
Kmore April 19, 1864:

-“The world ‘ has never__' had a good
definition of the word liberty, and the
American people, just now, are much
in want of one. We all declare for
liberty, ‘but in using the" same word
we do not all mean the same. thing.
With some the word liberty may mean
for each man to do as he pleases with
himself and the product of his labor,
while with others the same ‘word may

. mean for some men. to do :as they

please with other meaiandthe product
of other men's labor. _ '_

‘Here are two, not only different
but inoompatable things called by the
same name liberty, and it follows that

. each of the things is, by the respective

parties, called by two different and
incompatible n am e s , liberty; and
tyranny.‘ Plainly the wolf and the
sheep are not agreed upon a definition
of the word liberty and precisely the
same difference prevails today among
us human creatures.’.’ .

This is my answer to what. Senator
McCarran is doing today in the U. S.
A., answered by President Lincoln 88
years ago in the name of a free nation

draft bargaining demands

CALGARY, Alta — The membership
of Local 800 has drafted -the bargain-
ing program for coming negotiations in
the metals industry in this city. The
program calls for a 2§tcent Wage hike,
payfor all statutory holidays, double
time‘ for allwovertime, increased vaca-
tion-with-pay‘ benefits, Company-paid
welfare and the Rand formula of union
security; , C

The program has already been pre-_
sented to Dominion Bridge & River-

‘side Iron, where negotiations broke

down when the Company ‘proposed a

4%, \.age cut. The dispute is now be- 

ing mediated by ‘a Government concil-
ator. Bargaining with Calgary Iron

under way. ' The members are proving

the Dominion Government to foist the

anti—labour Bill H8 on the Canadian. 0

people very seriously. They have'ac-
quired a large amount of the League

Bill H8, for distribution among the
membership and ether Workers in this

area.

The attempt by the St. Laurent gov-

‘ernment to sneak this legislation

through on the orders of the U. S. gov-

ernment, is being opposed vigorously

by Canadian workers, who want no
part of McCarran type legislation in
Canada. Thought control, and interfer-
ence with the workers’ right to strike,
is foreign to Canadian democracy.

 mines of Northern Rhodesia and other
7‘-African mines ended a 3-week strike.
_They agreed to arbitration of their

demand for a wage increase of 2 shil-
lings and 8 pence (a little more than

0:30 cents) ‘ a day.

According to the London Times, these
North Rhodesian copper mines are ver-
itable gold mines 'for the British and
corporations _Who exploit
them. "Profit statements show the Rho-
desian Anglb—American Ltd. increased
to over 21 million pounds ste_rling in

C the fiscal year 1951-52.

Thatisimore than 6 million pounds

over what they made in the preceding .

year, while the Rhokana company‘ real-

, ized, in the same fiscal.’ year, more than

12 millian pounds profit as against 10
million in the earlier year. The stock-

holders of Roan Antelops, in the course _

of this year, benefitted by a 50% in-
,_creas_e, and those of Fulfulira, by 40

 , percent. “Copper producers of ‘ Rho-

desia are now rri‘aking more than ever”
reports the Observer of August 31.

Let’s figure this demand for more

wages for 37.000 African workers. It
would mean a total of less than 5,000
pounds a day, or 1,800,000 per year—-
while the Rhodesian mines have ex-

tracted copper worth 7,000,000 pounds’

in the one month of July alone.

According to the WFTU; News Let-.
ter: '

“The ’African miners are not only
fighting for a wage increase. They

also ask for the removal of discrimina-

tory rules which prevent them from

‘ getting certain jobs reserved exclusive-

ly for European" workers. - "

“The Federation‘ of African“ Miners

end three-week strike

has demanded, as a first step in the
realization of this objective, the im-
mediate application of the recommenda-
tions of the Dalgleish Report, issued by
a commission which studied workers

‘conditions in this British colony in

Central Africa. “The conclusions of
this Report”, states the Times of Oc-
tober 21, “have never been taken seri-
ously. In fact, the London paper con-
tinues, “the actual situation is that any
attempt to apply the recommendations
of the Dalgleish Report would be a
direct blow at all the social and ‘racial
conventions now in effect throughout-
the‘ s“‘outhernl part of Central Africa.

“The African miners general strike
proves that the Negro. workers of Rho-
desia are not .willing to endlessly turn‘
in the /infernal circle drawn for them
by the imperialists.

“As for the European workers, let,
us refer again to the ~ Times, which
stated on Oct. 21: ' .

‘The ' Federation of European
.Miners of ‘Rhodesia firmly, main-
tain their opinion that»the discrim- ‘
inatory racial rules in the copper
industryare. not the fault of the
Federation and that the companies

_could, if they wanted, bring in a
«larger numberof African workers
into the mines.’ A ‘ ‘

“Thus, the. European workers are

not willing to‘ draw the chestnuts out A

of the fire for the greater profits of

’ the corporations who exploit them as

well as. their black, fellowlworkers. ’

A “Against 0 c ol 0 n i a l exploitation,
against ‘racial hatred, the Rhodesian
workers, black or white, will answer
by the unity of all workers against the
exploiters.” V
