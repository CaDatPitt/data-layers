she delivered before a Democratic Party Women’s meet‘-
ing November 15, 1951 caused attorneys for the Com-
munist Party to move for her disqualiﬁcation as a member
of the SACB. In this talk she compared the hearings to
“an old recipe for rabbit stew.” She explained that “ﬁrst
you must catch the rabbit.”

The board denied the motion to disqualify Dr. McHale,
citing in support of its ruling the decision of the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals in the Dennis case. Although
juror Russell Janney in that case had declared, “We are
already ﬁghting a War with Communism,” the Circuit
Court, argued the SACB, held that this “was insufficient
to disqualify him.” V

The Attorney General’s case is being handled by Wil-
liam A. Paisley, born in Mississippi, reared in Tennessee
and now living off the Democratic pork barrel in Wash-
ington, he is assisted, among others, by Nathan Lenvin
who, until the judge dismissed the case last fall,
boasted he had prepared the prosecution of Dr. W. E. B.
Du Bois and his co—defendants Who‘ Were charged with
advocating peace.

Challenging the government’s synthetic case are three
hard-hitting lawyers Whose skill in their profession as
Well as their ability to deal with the complicated political
and social issues must impress even the cynics on the
other side of the counsel table. They are former Congress-

man Vito Marcantonio, John  Abt, former special as- _

sistant to the U.S. Attorney General and for many years
counsel for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Amer-
ica; and Joseph Forer, Who as OPA attorney, gave battle
to price chiselers during the War.

/l Snare for All

THESE HEARINGS dragged on, four days a Week, for 14
months. The government took a full year to complete its
case. In June of this year the respondent (Communist
Party) began its presentation. Up to that time the record
had already ﬁlled 12,500 pages of transcript, exclusive
of 569 documentary exhibits from past and current Marx-
ist literature, beginning with the C ommunisz Manifesto,

’ accounting for additional thousands of pages. The pur-

pose of all this is to prove that the Communist Party is
“dominated and controlled” by the Soviet Union, and
hence required, under pain of jail sentences, to register
itself and the names of all its members, subjecting them
not only to the loss of their jobs, but to prosecution under
the Smith Act and the new offense, created by the McCar-
ran Act itself, of “substantially contributing to the estab-
lishment of a totalitarian dictatorship.”

The dragnet character‘ of the legislation is established
by sweeping deﬁnitions which could be applied to almost
anybody. Penalties for failure to register include a ﬁne
up to $10,000 and a prison sentence up to ﬁve years.
“Each day of failure to register” is speciﬁed as a separate
crime subject to the full penalty of the law.

The board is virtually instructed to brand as “Com—
munist fronts” groups or persons Who have not indicated
public and vociferous disagreements With the Communist
Party. These organizations are called upon to list oﬁicers
.and contributors, but not members.

All non-citizens charged with membership, present or
past, in organizations that the board orders to register
are subject to deportation. Those not accepted by countries

11

 

 
 

to Which they have been ordered deported can, under the
law, be kept in jail indeﬁnitely.

The recent Supreme Court decision sanctions the With-
holding of bail and hence indeﬁnite imprisonment of such
non—citizens. I

A virtual parole system is set up for such non—citizens
requiring that they report regularly to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to submit to medical and psy-
chiatric examinations and “to give information under oath
as to their nationality, circumstances, habits, ‘associations
and activities.” If they don’t give names of persons for‘
new persecution, they will be punished.

The law also sets up procedures for revoking citizen-
ship. Thus, any person who joins a so—called “Communist
action” organization Within ﬁve years after becoming a
citizen can have his citizenship revoked. In other Words
citizenship revocation is an ever—present threat.

A Built-in Verdict

A FITTING PROLOGUE to the hearings of the SACB is pro-
vided by the characterization of the Communist Party by
the sponsors of the McCarran Act Which provides for a
“fair hearing” of the accused. Thus in reporting the bill
to the House of Representatives, the Un—American
Activities Committee, which had the bill in charge, pro-
claimed that “as a result of evidence adduced before Vari-
ous committees of the Senate and the House of Represen-
tatives,” the Congress “ﬁnds” that the Communist moVe~
ment “is a World-Wide revolutionary movement Whose
purpose it is, by treachery, deceit, infiltration into groups
(governmental and otherwise), espionage, sabotage, terv
rorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to estab<

12

 

  

lish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship in the countries
throughout the world through the medium of a world-
wide Communist organization.”

An almost identical statement appears in the Report
of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Attorney
General is expected, presumably, to prove his case before
the Subversive Activities Control Board that the Com-
munist Party of the U.S. is “dominated and controlled”
by the Soviet Union. But his job is perfunctory indeed.
Congress has smoothed his path with the advance judg-
ment that “the direction and control of the world Commu-
nist movement is vested in and exercised by the Communist
dictatorship of a foreign country.”

As for the law itself, not only does it convict in advance
the Communist Party, but those organizations and groups
Which, presumably, the Attorney General will accuse of
being under the control of the Party. The law, while set-
ting up the SACB for the purpose of hearing “evidence”
nevertheless states befoae/zand that “Communist organiza-
tions commonly known as ‘Communist fronts’ . . . in most
instances are created and maintained . . . in such manner as
to conceal the facts as to their true character and purposes
and membership.”

The whole structure and logic of the McCarran Act
compels the board to make a determination adverse to the
Party. Were the board to ﬁnd the Communist Party is
not a “Communist action” organization, it would by that
act put itself out of business and make the entire Act
meaningless.

The government is now trying to prove that the
Communist Party of the U.S. is “dominated and control-
led” by the Soviet Union. But four years ago the then

13

    

 
 

ment of Justice found it impossible to make such a prose-
cution stand up despite the Voorhis—McCormack Foreign
Agent Registration Acts which had then been on the
statute books for eight years and ten years respectively.
This admission by Clark (now on the Supreme Court
bench) was made in the course of his testimony before
the House Un—American Activities Committee on the
Mundt—Nixon Bill, precursor of the McCarran Act, in
February, 194-8. -

The lengthy proceedings in Washington presumably
constitute a hearing, unprejudiced and with no foregone
conclusions. Yet, at a time When the hearings were far
from over and the predictable ﬁndings some distance off,
Chairman Brown of the Subversive Activities Control
Board—-before Which the hearings were being held and
which was to decide Whether or not the Communist Party
of the U.S. is “dominated and controlled”—appeared be-
fore the House Appropriations Committee With the mod-

 

Attorney General, Tom Clark, testiﬁed that the Depart-_

est request for $470,000. Mr. Brown announced he needed‘

cash to initiate 15 simultaneous hearings on “Communist
front” groups, after a ﬁnding is arrived at on the current
case. Under such circumstances it is not a long guess on
What the outcome of the presentproceedings Will be,
because, under the law, inquiry into so—called “Communist
front” groups can only follow a determination that the
Communist Party is a"‘.‘Communist action” organization.

In an effort to establish its case the government called
to the stand a miscellany of renegades, stool—pigeons and
paid FBI informers who for years have made a profession
of peddling their Wares to the Un—American Committee
and anyone else Who Would pay to hear -them.

14

This One Has 4 P/L.D.

UNABLE TO MAKE a strong case by direct testimony from
this stock company of anti—Communism, the Department
of Justice brought forward a new actor and cast him in a
stellar role. He is Prof. Philip Moseley, Whose role it is
to establish that the Communist Party and all those in
America who ﬁght for peace, are “foreign agents,” because,
in the language ofthe McCarran Act, their Views do not
deviate from those of the Soviet Union.

Prof. Moseley’s self—portrayal as the above—the—battle
scholar, untouched and ‘uninﬂuenced by the conﬂicts of
the times proves, on closer examination, to be highly
idealized:

0 He is a former employee of the State Department
and a supporter of the Pentagon’s aggressive war policies.

0 He recently addressed a meeting of the Ukrainian.

Nationalists who Work for the destruction of the Soviet
Union.

0 He is a chairman of the “Free Europe Committee,”
ﬁnanced by the Ford Foundation. Purpose of the Com-
mittee is to incite counter—revolutionary and separatist
movements in the USSR and the People’s Democracies.

0 He is paid $5 0 a day as an “expert Witness,” for
each day he testiﬁes and each _day spent “researching”

‘exhibits available in the press.

0 He is chief of Columbia University’s Russian In-
stitute. t

The Institute, indirectly subsidized by the federal gov-
ernment through scholarships, has .on more than one
occasion been the target‘ for attacks by Soviet commentators
as a “school for spies.” Moseley himself testiﬁed that a

15

 

considerable number of trainees at the Institute are State
Department employees, while an even larger proportion
are preparing for foreign service assignments by the De-
partment.

The professor’s technique was simple enough. He iden-
tiﬁed a Soviet document—Pmvda, I z=vestz'a—a speech by a
Soviet oﬁicial dealing with some aspect of foreign policy
ranging in time from the League of Nations in 1919 to the
Japanese Peace Treaty in 1951. He then identiﬁed a Com-
munist Party document, a Daily War/aw’ article or edito-
rial, a C.P. convention report or resolution dealing with
the same subject matter. He then pontiﬁcated that in his
opinion the two views were “closely” parallel.

The lawyers for the Communist Party argued vigorously
that all this had no tendency to show that the Soviet Union
“dominated and controlled” the Communist Party or made

it an agency of the former. In support of their position

they attempted to prove through cross examination, that:

0 Many non-Communist Americans and avowed anti-
Communists, from— Senator Borah in 1919 to Justice
William 0. Douglas in 1951 had expressed similar views.

I In many cases the position of the Communist Party
pre—dated the Soviet expression on the same subject.

0 The views were sound, justiﬁed by events, in the in-
terest of the American people and, in some cases, were
paralleled by the oﬂicial position of the United States
Government.

0 The views were arrived at independently through the
application to current problems of a common system of
political and scientiﬁc thought ﬁrst elaborated by Marx
and Engels a century ago.

16

F int /lme7m’memf——Or Conformity ?

ALL THIS OFFERED proof was rejected by the Board as
irrelevant and immaterial. The only issue, held the
Board, is whether the views are “parallel”, with that estab-
lished, “domination and control” is proved as far as they
are concerned. In this current heresy trial it is not neces-
sary to show that the “heretics’ ” ideas are evil or dan-
gerous. It is enough that they are similar to those of the
Soviet Union. The sentence of the tribunal thus becomes
automatic. _

The Government, for example, through its hired pro-
fessor, introduced ﬁve exhibits to prove its contention that
the views of Soviet spokesmen and American Communists
were similar on the issue of the Japanese Treaty. These
exhibits consisted of articles in the Soviet press and the
Communist press of the U.S. A

The Attorney General offered in evidence an article
in the Daily Worker of August 23, 1951, but sought to
muffle the fact that the Communist Party had formulated
and expressed its views on a Japanese peace treaty July 29,.
1945, even before the Soviet Union entered the war against
Japan. This Communist Party resolution adopted seven
years ago stated that powerful circles in Washington har-
bored the idea of a compromise with the Mikado in the
hope of maintaining Japan as a reactionary bulwark in the
Far East, denounced a “soft peace,” demanded demili-
tarization and called for payment of full reparations.

The Government of India opposed the treaty, and in
its note to the U.S. Government, assailed the fact that the
People’s Republic of China was not invited to the San
Francisco signing.

17

 

    

  

Speeches by the representatives of the Philippine and
Indonesian governments, which reluctantly signed the
treaty, in ‘San Francisco severely criticized the treaty for
its lack of provision for reparations and for other reasons
which “closely paralleled” the grounds of Soviet objec-
tions to the treaty. But all this evidence the Board ruled
out as irrelevant to the question of domination and control.

The far—reaching and dangerous implications of these
hearings were seen in the discussion around the liberal
British publication, N ew Statesman and N ation. An article.
in this publication by George Bernard Shaw had been
quoted by the authoritative Soviet newspaper, Izvestia.
Witness Moseley intoned that “while it is not a Communist
publication in the sense that it is not issued by the Com-
munist Party of Great Britain,” nevertheless “in some
aspects of its policies and recommendations it tends from
time to time to parallel many of the Soviet and foreign
recommendations.” ‘

Should the panel now sitting in Washington rule that
the Communist Party is a “Communist action” organiza-
tion, it will then proceed to ferret out “Communist—front”
groups. How, one wonders, would The Nation fare, for
here is a publication whose position roughly “parallels”
that of the British New Statesman and Nation. In these

 

circumstances publications like The Nation, as well as the s

New Republic, which support the basic policies of the
Administration, but from time to time express mild dis-
approval of goings—on in Washington, could be hauled
up before the McCarranites to prove their policies do not
parallel those of the Soviet Union.

Consider another exhibit introduced by the government.
It consisted of an article in a Soviet newspaper in 194-5

18

which condemned atrocities in China by Japanese occu-
pation forces. Prof. Moseley, the government expert,
testiﬁed that the article “closely paralleled” the views
of American Communists! Therefore, it is evidence of
“domination and control.”

At one point the professor laid great stress on the fact
that in 1933, nearly two decades before the McCarran Act
Was passed, the Daily Worker, American Communist news-
paper, had said that the League of Nations Would not
bar the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and for all practi-
cal purposes would sanction and support such an invasion.
The Witness said that this prediction “closely paralleled”
the Soviet view of the League of Nations.

W/zerz Trut/z I 5 “I rrele‘var2t”

MR. ABT ASKED THE WITNESS, Wasn’t it a fact that the pre~
diction had proved accurate. Objection from the govern—-
ment attorney: “What’s the difference if the prediction.
proved true!”

The attorney read from the book, The Proalems of
Lasting Peace, by Herbert Hoover and Hugh Gibson, as-
followsz »

“The Japanese aggression in Manchuria in September
1931 and during the next year, at Shanghai violated every

‘implication of the Covenant in spirit and letter. The au-

thority of the League Was brought to test in dealing with
the major powers. The League failed utterly in its dealing
with this gross breach of the Covenant.”

The Witness was asked:

“Would you agree with this characterization by Mr.
Hoover and Mr. Gibson of the role of the League of

19

 

Nations in the case of the Japanese invasion of Man-
churia?”

Mr. Lenvin: I object, Mr. Chairman; utterly irrel-
evant.

Chairman: The objection is sustained.

Similarly, attempts to show that numerous public per-
sonalities of diverse political opinions held the same views
on atomic energy control as those on the Left, proved
fruitless.

The government’s expert Witness drew many “parallels”
on a variety of issues: the War in Korea, the l\/Ioscow
treason trials, the rearma_ment and renaziﬁcation of Ger-
many, the struggle in Southeast Asia, atomic energy
control, the Italian peace treaty, the Second Front, the

‘ attempted assassination of the Italian Communist leader,

Togliatti; the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the
North Atlantic Pact, Greece, Viet Nam, the Philippines
and Burma, the World-Wide campaign for peace and for
banning atomic Weapons. ~

By Mr. M arcantonio:

Q. Is it your View that the 600 million people who signed
the Stockholm appeal were all seeking to advance Com-
zmunism?

Mr. Lenvin: Objection.

Chairman: Sustained.

‘  You are aware, are you not, that among the persons
who signed the Stockholm petition were Dr. Oswaldo Aranha
-of Brazil, former President of the UN General Assembly;
Lazaro Cardenas, former President of Mexico; Vittorio
‘Orlando, former Premier of Italy; Thomas Mann; George
Bernard Shaw; Henri Matisse; Emily Greene Balch, 1946
Nobel Prize winner; Justice James H. Wolfe of the Su-

20

preme Court of Utah, numerous Catholic, Protestant and
‘ Jewish clergy, and many other famous and prominent per-
_ sons? Are you aware of that?
Mr. Le'n=uz'n:' Objection. _

Chairman: Sustained.

Objected to, also, was Mr. Marcantonio’s question
whether an “informed observer would not reasonably
conclude” that the signing of the Stockholm appeal to ban
atomic weapons was in the “best interests of world peace
and in the best interests of the U.S.” The American Com—-
munists’ support of a cease-ﬁre in Korea was merely an
echo of Jacob Malik’s proposal of June 23, 1951, the gov-
ernment charged, and offered as evidence an article in the
The Sunday Worker headed, “World Hails Bid for Cease
Fire in Korea.”

Counsel for the Communist Party vainly attempted
to show:

0 The Communists energetically supported the John-
son resolution (Sen. Edwin C. Johnson, D—Colo.) intro-
duced in the U.S. Senate May 17, 1951. The Johnson-_
resolution preceded the Malik speech. _

0 Prior to the Malik speech the Communists of the
U.S. vigorously supported other and earlier proposals for
a cease-ﬁre including those made by India’s Premier

Nehru and the Arab bloc in the UN.

By Mr. 14 ht: .

Q. It is a fact, is it not, that there was in this country
and elsewhere almost universal welcoming of Mr. Malik’s
speech of June 23, 1951, opening a possibility of achieving
peace in Korea, is that correct?

Mr. Lenvén: Objection.

C’ hairman: Sustained.

21

 

    

  

Q. The United States did enter truce negotiations‘ in
Korea, did it not?
/1. Yes. ,
Q. Did the U.S. thereby “adopt a position advanced by
the Soviet government?”
Mr. Lenvin: Objection.

Chairman: Sustained.

Incredible though it may seem, the Attorney General’s
aides sought to show that the ﬁght on colonialism and
imperialism was a quite recent development and part of
-the much publicized “Moscow plot.” An ironic touch was
provided by Mr. Marcantonio when he asked the dis-
play witness of the government, Prof. Moseley, if he re-
called a speech on U.S. policy toward Asia by Dean
Acheson before the Commonwealth Club of San Fran-
cisco, March 15, 1950. Acheson on that occasion had said
that “the deep and revolutionary movement of the peoples
of Asia” is made up of two dominant ideas: “the ﬁrst is a
revulsion against misery and poverty as a normal condition
of life, the second is a revulsion against foreign domina-
tion.”

The government witness, Prof. Moseley, replied: “Yes,
I recall the general terms.”

He was asked whether he remembered reading Justice
William 0. Douglas’ famous article on the same subject,
including his statement that “If any power had done to us
what the French have done to the people of Indo—China,
we would produce the most glorious revolution the world
ever witnessed.”

Mr. Lenvin: Objection.
C hairman: Sustained.

22

 

The deﬁnitive View of the Goverment-McCarran posi-

tion, concurred in repeatedly by the panel’s~chairman, was

enunciated by the Department of Justice’s Mr. Paisley:

“It doesn’t matter whether the particular view or policy
is held by many people, by" some people, or by all the
people of the world. The issue is whether the Soviet Union
and the Communist Party of the U.S. hold similar views.”

Prof. Moseley’s formula regarding the Soviet Union
and its alleged relation to the American Communists is
paralleled by Sen. McCarthy’s homicidal crusades against
Owen Lattimore, Ambassador Jessup and John Carter
Vincent. Ironically-, the technique which Truman’s De-
partment of Justice is using in the hearing room is em-
ployed by the McCarthys and McCarrans on Capitol Hill
to discredit the Truman administration.

The Paid Expert F uméles

A SAMPLE OF the veracity of one of the star witnesses. A
professional informer at $50 a day and expenses is testi-
fying (he gets twice the scale, for he is an “expert”). He
is Benjamin Gitlow, expelled from the Communist Party
23 years ago. On direct examination he told how an “agent”
was sent to this country by the Communist International
in 1925 to organize a trade union delegation to the Soviet
Union. Vito Marcantonio is examining:

Q. That man’s name was Purcell? You say he came
here as an agent of the Communist International?

A . Yes. That is right.

Q. Do you know if Mr. Purcell came to attend the A.
F. of L. convention here in 1925?

23

|
x
I
1 .

 

    

44. That—now you refresh——that was one of his reasons
for coming here, too.

Apart from the fact that Purcell was a “Moscow agent,”
according to Gitlow, he found it hard to remember any-
thing of interest. Marcantonio sought to stir his lethargic
memory by reading William Green’s introduction of Pur-
cell to the A. F. of L. convention:

“Brother Purcell has long been engaged in trade union
work in Great Britain. Hepis a member of the Furniture
Workers Association. He is now a member of the General
Council of the British Trade Union Congress, and last year

,.served with honor and distinction as its president.

“He was recently elected, from a coal—mining constitu-

ency, as a member of the British Parliament. He is the presi-
dent of the International Federation of Trade Unions.
ihese are the honors that have been placed upon him by
I e working people _of Great Britain and of the European
continent. Surely this ought to serve as a splendid introduc-
tion to this convention and to the American people.”

Moscow agent? You see, in 1925, Purcell, (now dead),
urged American workers to visit the Soviet Union and
spoke up for American—Soviet cooperation. Nor is this all.

Gitlow swore under oath that Sen. Paul Douglas (D.-
Ill.) was a Communist at the time he went to the Soviet
Union in 1927 with the ﬁrst American Workers Dele-
gation. (Gitlow was later forced to retract this.)

Fact and fancy are synonymous for Gitlow, as well as
his fellow—informers. Helping the AMcCarranites build up
their case of “foreign domination and control,” Gitlow
testiﬁed that the Communist International helped ﬁnance

24

    

the Communist Party election campaign of 1928. He said
the sum decided on was $35,000, the initial payment

‘ $3,500.

But Gitlow had testiﬁed at previous trials and hearings
and this often proves awkward for an informer with a

. loose—leaf memory. Examine the record:

0 Inthe Canwell Committee hearings in Washington
State Gitlow testiﬁed that the “Moscow Allotment” was
$5 0,000.

0 In the Harry Bridges deportation proceedings and
the current McCarran witchhunt he swore it was $35,000.

0 In his book, I Confess he gave the sum as $50,000.

0' He told the McCarran board the “initial payment”
was $3,500.

0 In the Canwell hearings and in his I Confess he said
the “initial payment” was $5,000.

0 In the Bridges case he swore the “initial payment”
was $3,000.

The Two Gizfldws

AND YET, HOW CAN ONE EXPECT Gitlow to remember
ﬁctitious ﬁgures when he can’t even recall the date he was
released from prison, though he describes the day as
“memorable,‘”in his book, I Confess.

Questioned on this point, he said it was “somewhere in
the ‘end of 1923 or the beginning of 1924.” Actually, it
was z'n‘Decen/Mar, 1925. '

Mr. Marcantonio is questioning Gitlow and the fol-
lowing revealing colloquy took place:

Q. Now, speaking about the period7’"during which you
5 I 25

 

    

  

were a member-—and I am not going beyond that—would
you not say that the Communists have given vitality and

force to the issue of industrial unionism, without which the

organization of the mass production industries would have

been impossible? '

- A. They did not.

Q. Would you not say that it was the Communists,. more
than any other force, that have instilled the American work-
ers with trade union consciousness, by raising in the unions
the issue of the organization of the. unorganized workers,
that the Communists have been responsible for bringing mil-
lions of workers into the trade unions?

A. They were not.

Q. Would you not say that by raising the legitimate politi-
cal issues in the unions, the Communists have been responsible
for broadening the organized workers’ political outlook?

A. They never raised a legitimate political issue in the
unions. '

Q. And would you not say that the Communists have de-
veloped new streamlined strike techniques and methods for
organizing workers on an industry and nationwide scale?

A. They developed new methods of strike strategy and
tactics which were foreign to the American trade unionists.

Q. All right. Did you write this book, The Whole of
Their Lives? - I

A. I did. .

Q. What was the date of that writing, again?

A. 1948. —

Q. I now read from page 105 of your book and I ask
if you made this statement: “American trade unionism owes
much to the Communists. The Communists have given
vitality and force to the issue of industrial unionism without
which the organization of the mass production industries would
have been impossible. The Communists more than any other

26

 

source have instilled the American workers‘ with trade union
consciousness. By raising in the unions the issue of the or-
ganization of the unorganized workers, the Communists have
been responsible for bringing millions of Workers into the trade
unions. By raising legitimate political issues in the unions,
the Communists have been responsible for broadening the or-
ganized workers’ techniques and methods for organizing
workers on an industry and nationwide basis.” Did you make
this statement?

A. I did.

“U7zpleamnt -/lm=wers”

IT WAS REVEALED during the hearings that Sen. McCar-
ran’s Judiciary Committee Was not only coaching govern-
ment witnesses but was also actually checking on the g
original members of the board. Gitlow, for example, Was 2
made to admit that he had been conferring with Benjamin
Mandel, research director for McCarran’s Committee.
Outraged because he himself had been an object of the
surveillance, the then chairman of the board, former Rep.
LaFollette, took a hand in the questioning.

The exchange between LaFollette and Gitlow tells
the story.

Q. Mr. Gitlow, I would like to ask you this: in any of the
conversations you have had with Mr. Mandel with reference
to the conduct of this case, have you discussed with him your
opinion or evaluation of the conduct of any member of this
Panel during the hearing?

A. I discussed the conduct of this case. I discussed the
attorneys in the case. I discussed the members of the Panel.

Q. You discussedvthe members of the Panel?

Q. And their conduct during the sessions of the hearing?
A. I did. ‘ ' '
Q. And do you not know that the question of the con-
ﬁrmation of the members of this board, including, of course,
the members of the hearing panel, is undecided at present,
by the Senate Judiciary Committee?
14. I knew of that fact.
Q. Do you or do you notiknow that. Mr. Mandel ison
the payroll of the Senate Judiciary Committee?
A. I know he is on the payroll of the Senate Judiciary
 Committee. '

By Mr. M arcantonio:

Q. Did he also tell you in this conversation that this
money would then be delivered by courier to the U.S., to
the Communist Party there?

ﬂ. Yes, he did.

WITNESS NAT HONIG, a reporter for the Hearst L05
Angela: Examiner, brought to the hearings the yarn he
‘s has peddled to innumerable Red—hunting congressional
‘, probes. He told an elaborate story of having carried money
1 from Russia for Communist activities abroad 17 years ago.
, The cash, 94,000 French francs, he said he carried “in a
:0 sort of stocking which was a money belt which I tied
around my middle.” Honig explained that an individual
named Norman had given him the money and he told

There is no question about that?

Not in my mind. He told me that.

Were you under oath when you testified there?
Yes, I was.

Do you remember being asked this question: “What
was this money for?” And do you recall this answer: “F or
French party work—well, I couldn’t say exactly. That I
wasn’t told. I assumed it was either for that or may even——
and I did ﬁnd out later that it happened——it might have been
for further transmission to another country.”

‘.0E“~‘.0Fe‘.0

Is it any wonder that in the second Bridges deportation
hearing Honig was described by the presiding judge as a
dubious witnesf At that time, in 194-1, the judge said he
could only credit that part of Honig’s testimony which
was corroborated by other witnesses.

Paul Crouch, another professional informer, now on
the Government payroll, swore that Roger Baldwin, for
many years chief of the American Civil Liberties Union,
had worked with him, Crouch, in “stirring up revolts in
Latin America.” I

Describing his experiences in California, Crouch thought
he _scored a bull’s eye for the government when he said
that the North American Aviation strike at Inglewood
was called oif only because the Soviet Union entered the
war after its invasion by the Nazis on June 22, 194-1. Coun-
sel for the Communist Party, however, introduced an issue
of the N ew York Times, showing that this strike of United
Auto Workers members ended on June 9—nearly two
weeks before the USSR became part of the wartime coa-
lition—when federal troops were ordered in and took over
the plant. '

T/Le Informer as “Hero”

ONE or THE MOST GLAMORIZED FBI agents is Herbert
A. Philbrick, who spent nine years in the Communist Party
as a spy. In testimony before the McCarran board Phil-
brick acknowledged that the. Party, which he sought to
depict as secret and conspiratorial, was listed in the Boston
telephone book. He said he participated in the writing
and distribution of leaﬂets calling for support of the war
against Hitlerism, for blood donations and bond pur-
chasing. Philbrick admitted the C.P. taught its members
to Work for equal rights for the Negro people,‘ fought
discrimination and police brutality and was active in the
campaign for FEPC. Under cross—eXamination he con-
ceded that he never had the pretext to report the eXist—
ence of any ﬁre arms to the FBI, nor any act of force and
violence. _

Philbrick was compelled to admit that the American
Youth for Democracy was, in his own Words, “a broad
win—the—war coalition of Communists and non—Commu—
nists” composed of “young individuals interested in doing
everything possible to win the War in Europe and Japan.”
Nevertheless, in pursuance of his assignment by the FBI,
he turned in the names as well as pho'tographs of members
of that group. .

Among other “subversive” activities he admitted re-
porting to the G-men. was the 1942 Boston Youth for
Victory rally, which was supported by Governor (now
Secretary of Labor) Maurice Tobin.

In the Foley Square trial, where Philbrick’s testimony
helped convict the eleven Communist leaders, he swore
that a Mrs. Fletcher, the leader of his Party club, called

30

  

for “arming the workers now.” But at the McCarran
hearings, Philbrick was ﬁnally compelled. to assert that
Mrs. Fletcher was not voicing the views of the Communist
Party, on the contrary, she was criticizing it for its “nam-
by—pamby” position, as he put it. The exposure of Phil-
brick’s self—admitted false testimony makes it clear that
the whole episode was a fabrication.

Another government witness, John Lautner, a. former
Communist official who became a spy for the FBI, swore
that the Communist Party constitution which called for
the expulsion of any member advocating violent or pro-
vocative acts, was virtually kept a secret from the member-
ship. But on cross—eXamination was forced to admit that in
Party classes which he himself taught the Constitution
was required reading on the basis of study outlines which
he himself used.

A familiar ﬁgure at frame—up hearings, _William O.
Nowell, testified that he had been active in the Anti-
Imperialist League in Detroit some years ago. In reply
to a question by the prosecutor as to the organization’s
aims, he "answered: “To oppose imperialism and impe-
rialist war, to oppose colonial oppression and to link the
colonial struggle for Negro rights in America.” Hence one
must conclude that the struggle of peoples anywhere for
peace and independence is regarded as a crime under the
McCarran Act—to judge by the importance the govern

‘ ment attaches to “evidence” of this kind. ~

One professional testiﬁer—Joseph Kornfedder—~it is
worth‘ noting, began to Work as a steady anti—Communist
witness immediately after the government dropped de-
portation proceedings against him. Although born in
Czechoslovakia, he had somehow gotten himself a Scranton,

31

 

  

Pa., birth certiﬁcate which the immigration authorities of
the time declined to accept. Several years later however,
the FBI obligingly helped him obtain citizenship, far from
its usual practice with regard to aliens.

Protecting Perjurerx

BROUGHT TO WASHINGTON from Detroit, Mrs. Berenice
Baldwin, whom the FBI “planted” in the Communist
Party, made a valiant effort to provide startling stuﬂ.
Two things emerged from her testimony: long before her
appearance before the McCarran Board she had been spot-
ted as a spy and dropped from the Party despite her tearful
protestations that she would “miss the comrades” 5 evidence
in her own handwriting which would have clearly convicted
her as a perjurer was in possession of the FBI, but the
Department of Justice protected its witness by refusing to
turn this evidence over to the Board.

Mrs. Baldwin, whose favorite occupation while in the
C.P. was the collection of membership lists, testiﬁed that
at a meeting she attended in Detroit, November 4, 194-7,
the promotion of the publication F or A Lasting Peace, for
at People’: Democracy, was a special point on the agenda.
She knew that was the date, she testiﬁed on cross—eXami—
nation, because she had circled it on her calendar. She
circled every meeting she attended, she said, at which there
was “subversive discussion.” VVhen attorneys for the Com-
munist Party produced the ﬁrst copy of this publication
(from the ﬁles of the Library of Congress) and showed
its date to be Nov. 10, a week after the meeting, they de-
manded the FBI report, with reference to the calendar,
and the discussion of the yet—unborn publication, in order

32

 

  

to impeach the credibility of the Witness. The demand Was’

rejected. Clearly, protecting perjurers is the least of the
courtesies the FBI can accord its “plants” and professional
anti-Communist informers.

E lastic Memories

EVEN MORE BRAZEN than the government’s coddling of
Mrs. Baldwin Was the Way in Which it handled Louis F.
Budenz, renegade Communist Who had made a lucrative
business out of his appearances as a professional Witness,
although he had been repeatedly discredited. Budenz Was
the 22nd and ﬁnal Witness put on by the Attorney General
before the Subversive Activities Control Board.

The Justice Department, in sponsoring Budenz at the
hearings, put itself in the unusual position of vouching
for the credibility of a Witness who is regarded as a chronic
liar even in high government circles.- Senator Herbert
Lehman D—N.Y.), in a speech on the ﬂoor of the US.
Senate, demanded Budenz’s investigation for perjury.
And President Truman himself expressed public support
of the Lehman charge which grew out of Budenz’s testi-
mony that John Carter Vincent, a high state department
oﬂicial, Was a “Communist.”

Budenz has appeared as a professional, paid—by—the—day
Witness more than a score of times before federaland state
courts, House and Senate committees, as Well as deporta-
tion hearings. He admitted under cross—eXamination in the
current Foley Square trial that he had spent twice as much
time testifying for the FBI as he had teaching. A feature
of his appearances is his capacity for recalling What seem
to be new and “startling” facts needed by those who enlist

33

 
 

his services. This talent has immense political as well as
commercial value, for Budenz tries to give his stories “new
angles,” thus constantly refurbishing his old products. An
illustration is his Senate committee testimony about Vin-
cent, as well as Owen Lattimore, which he “remembered”
after a lapse of 15 years.

At the SACB hearings Budenz testiﬁed that when he
was editor of the Midwest Daily Record in Chicago he
sought ﬁnancial aid from the treasurer of the Communist
Party in New York. He was told, he said that while in
“normal times” money from “abroad” was available, the
-channels were temporarily closed down and no “Moscow
gold” was on tap. But he told a different story when he
testiﬁed before the Senate Judiciary Committee in May,
194-9. At that time, when asked about the charge that
US. Communists were ﬁnanced by “Moscow,” he replied,

0 _ “of my own knowledge, I cannot say.”

 

Yet this is the man who helped convict the 11 Com-
munist leaders in Foley Square, who is being used again
in the case of the 13 now on trial in New York and was
‘trotted out as a star witness by the Department of Justice
in its recent proceedings before the Subversive Activities
Control Board!

That he was making a good thing out of his new career
was admitted by Budenz under cross—eXamination when
he testiﬁed that he had netted over $70,000 for writing
and lecturing since he hit the sawdust trail seven years ago.
This does not include his salary as a much—absent profes-
sor at N otre Dame and Fordham, nor his fees for testify-
ing, usually at the rate of $25 a day plus expenses.

The character of Budenz’s “conversion” has evoked
more than mild skepticism. On the ﬂoor of the United

34-

 

  

States Senate on May 12, 1950, Senator Dennis Chavez,
Democrat of New Mexico and himself a Roman Catholic,
denounced Budenz as a bigamist who is using the church
“as a shield and a cloak to purvey un—American, un—Chris—
tian, dubious testimony.”

The M mi in M cmeeles

A DRAMATI-C CHANGE in the atmosphere and tempo of the
proceedings took place with the appearance of the iﬁrst
witness for the ‘Communist Party. He was John Gates,*
editor of the Daily I/Vorker. He is also a member of the
Party’s national committee.

One of the ﬁrst 11 victims of the Smith Act, he is now
serving a ﬁve—year prison term in Atlanta federal peni-
tentiary;

Brought handcuffed to the hearing room from the
Washington jail where he was temporarily held, accom-
panied by four U.S. marshals, Gates testiﬁed for six days
about the aims, objectives and methods of the Communist
Party—and why he himself became a Communist.

A veteran of two years’ service with the International
Brigade in Spain, and four years as a paratrooper with the
U.S. Army in World War II, Gates was asked by Vito
Marcantonio to state to whom he owed allegiance.

“To the sovereign pea-pleof the U nixed S_.mzte5,” the wit-
ness replied. He added that he had often taken the oath
of allegiance to the ﬂag and to the nation—“one nation
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” Gates said
Communists have no mental reservations when they take

"" Elizabeth Gurlcy Flynn and Dr. Herbert Aptheker testiﬁed after this pamphlet
was on the press.

35

 

 
 

that oath even though they are Well aware that today “We
are not ‘one nation indivisible’ and that liberty and j.ustice
are not granted to all.” He continued:

“One nation indiVisible—that is a goal still to be
achieved. There is a nation of the rich and a nation of the
poor. There is a small white ruling class which oppresses
the Negro people.

“Nor does liberty and justice exist for all. There is one
justice for the rich and another justice for the poor. There
is one law for the White and another law for the Negro.
There is one law for some and another law for Commu-
nists. But When, ultimately, Socialism prevails in our coun-
try, then We Will truly have liberty and justice for all,
one law for all, and Without antagonistic classes We shall
indeed have one nation indivisible.”

Covering a Wide range of subjects, all impinging on the
crucial questions of war and peace, Gates emphasized that

0 The supreme issue confronting the people of the
U.S. and the World is that of lasting peace.

0 The McCarran Act is the “most vicious and undemo-
cratic statute in the history of our country—an enabling
act for the institution of fascism.”

0 The Communist Party will resist every effort to
drive it underground and Will ﬁght to protect its right
to function legally as “the political party of the Working
class.” I

0 The Communist Party is “a million times more dem-
ocratic than the Democratic or Republican parties,” adding
that the Party ﬁnanced itself Without help from any for-
eign source, but solely through dues of its members and

contributions from its friends.
0 It Would be foolish to expect political appointees to

36

 

  

make the kind of ﬁnding that would do away with their
own well—payi_ng jobs. Said Gates: “If this board were to
rule in favor of the Communist Party,.the board would be
liquidating itself and the $12,500 salaries of each of its
members.” ' '

Gates had come up from Atlanta in buses, manacled,
and under guard. He had prepared his testimony in solitary
in Danbury prison,'to which he had been brought pre-
paratory to going to Washington, without facilities and
under constant surveillance of guards.

Even hostile observers could not help being impressed
by the stature of the man, the scope of his knowledge and
experience; his spirited presentation—its clarity and force-
fulness——and his conﬁdent, buoyant bearing after more
than a year in prison.

The Zl/faster Plan

IT IS THE PLAN of the McCarran board—once it rules
that the Communist Party is “dominated and controlled”
by the Soviet Uni_on_—to move on to what the Act calls
“Communist—front” groups. Thereafter the criterion of a
“Communist—front” group will be the degree of its “non-
deviation” from the proscribed “Communist—action” or-
ganization. While an appeal to the courts from the ﬁnd-
ings of the panel now sitting would defer punishment for
those involved in the current proceeding, it would in no
Way postpone continuing hearings on alleged “Communist-
front” organizations. "At that point the board is empowered
to ﬂood the country with appointed examiners who can
set up simultaneous hearings invarious parts of the coun-
try—hearings that will entail harassment, expense, charac-
ter assassination and economic sanctions against individuals

37

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

and institutions and provide a ﬁeld day for the warmonger-
ing and sensation—hunting press of the land.

If a union or community group has been active in the
ﬁght for peace, for pensions, for public housing, against
discrimination, for national health insurance,'or any other
issue which Communists have also supported, such organ-
izations would be marked for "destruction when the De-
partment of Justice and the board brand it a “communist
front” for harboring these views.

Union locals which for years have as a matter of policy
(protection against boss blacklisting) kept their member-
ship rolls secret could be wiped out by the McCarranites.

Any organization or group labeled “Communist front”
by the McCarran inquisitors will be compelled to register,
ﬁle lists of oﬂicers and contributors, keep supervised rec-
ords and accounts and ﬁle annual reports. Failure to con-
form to any of these requirements will merit severe pen-
alties. Groups, organizations, societies or associations
must label every publication and the outside envelopes
of all mail as coming from a “Communist organization.”

Can there be any doubt that eﬁorts will be made to use
this new instrument of inquisition against the Negro
people? Southern laws, Jim Crow and segregation, North
and South, police terror and lynching, have failed to stem
the ﬁght of the Negro people for their right to a decent
life, equal job opportunities, to vote and to be represented
by public oﬂicials.

On countless occasions the “Communist” label has been
pinned on groups of Negro and white Americans ﬁghting
for these things. The McCarran Act, its sponsors hope,
will provide the passkey for sweeping assaults on organ-
izations and individuals ﬁghting for Negro rights.

38

The inﬂuential Washington Post editorially has de-
scribed the current kangaroo hearings in the nation’s
capital as “a ritual performance,” adding that “the main
reason for going through the ritual is to avoid the constitu-
tional prohihition against hills of attainder* by a proceed-
ing which conforms to the requirements of due process.”

Circumventing the Constitution  

THE Washington Post’: CONCLUSION is based on something
more substantial than a surmise. There is, for example,
the unabashed statement of Sen. Richard M. Nixon of
California, EisenhoWer’s running mate.

In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Nixon, one of the authors of the McCarran bill and at the
time a leading member of the House Committee on Un—
American Activities which had charge of the bill in the
House, stated its purpose in these Words:

“We feltthat the Mundt bill, in its original form, Was
not the proper approach to the problem for two reasons.
In the ﬁrst place, the bill speciﬁcally named the Commu-
nist Party of the United States and attempted to build
its deﬁnitions around the name of the Party. From having
heard the Witnesses before our committee, We came to the
conclusion that naming the Communist Party by name and
attempting to build the entire registration provisions
around ‘such a deﬁnition Was an unconstitutional approach
and consequently the committee attempted to ﬁnd a legis-
lative device (emphasis added——S.G.) for meeting the

‘A bill of attaindct is ﬁnding of guilt by a legislative body, thus usurping
the power of a court and iuty.

problem in a constitutional manner.” (Hearings before
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 80th Cong., 2nd
Session, H.R. 5 852, P. 40). -

It is not mere coincidence that the McCarran Act which
establishes this “ritual”—Nazi style—also makes provi-
sion for concentration camps. The Victims of the quiet
proceedings in Room 113 are being marked for intern~
ment behind barbed Wire.

By declaring an “internal security emergency,” the
President, under the McCarran Act, can throw tens of
thousands behind barbed wire. He can proclaim such an
“emergency” in the event of either (1) invasion of the
U.S. or its possessions; (2) declaration of war by Con-
gress, or (3) insurrection within the U.S. in aid of a for-v
eign enemy. It is not diﬂicult to imagine that any large
scale strike activity on the part of labor in or anywhere
related to so—called defense industry can be inﬂated into
an “insurrection” for the purpose of this provision of the
McCarran Act.

The law provides that within 4-8 hours after apprehen-
sion the victim shall be taken before a preliminary hearing
oﬂicer who will recite the grounds for the detention. Con-
centration camp victims have the right, under the law,
to appeal for release to a Detention Review Board, but the
burden will be upon them to prove why they should not
be held. (The board will consist of nine members at salaries
of $12,500 each). Presumably the internees will have the
right to counsel—if they can aﬂiord it and can ﬁnd lawyers
who will risk their careers and their liberty to take their
cases. Contrary to all democratic legal procedure, every
person seized will be presumed to be guilty.

The Nazi Model

IT IS A MATTER OF RE-CORD that President Truman and six
leading administration senators were heartily in accord
With the Kilgore bill and its concentration camp provisions,
even though Truman Went through the motions of veto-
ing the McCarran Act which includes the Kilgore pro-
posals. That talk is cheap is proved by former Attorney
General McGrath’s “opposition” and his characterization
of the McCarran Act as “evidence of hysteria.”

The McCarran provisions for rounding up tens of thou-
sands of Americans and throwing them into concentration
camps because they may differ With current Administration
policies on price and rent control, anti-union legislation,
foreign policy and the key issues of War and peace, recalls
the laws “for the protectionof the Reich” promulgated
by Hitler and his murder gang.

“A person is punishahle,” so went the Nazi code, “who
commits an act which the law declares to be punishable,’
or which deserves punishment in accordance with the fun-
damental purpose of the law and sound popular feeling.”

The Department of Justice has already announced that
Congress has appropriated funds for six concentration
camps. One of these is the former military airport at
Wickenburg, Ariz. The others are World War II prisoner-
of—War camps at Florence, Ariz., and El Reno, Okla. Work
is in progress on similar unused government properties,
including Tule Lake, California. Estimates of the total
capacity of these concentration camps run as high as
100,000.

James V. Bennett, Director of the Bureau of Prisons,
is ‘making no secret that he is getting the concentration

41

  

camps into shape. It is also known that hard-boiled “ex-
perienced” guards in Various federal prisons are being
oﬁered similar jobs in the concentration camps that are
being prepared for occupancy.

Meanwhile, Sen. James O. Eastland (D.-Louisiana),

. among others, is impatient and has introduced a bill calling

for the immediate declaration of a state of emergency so
that detention of ﬁghters for peace in concentration camps
can be commenced Without delay.

Ouzflewing Peace

IT IS THESE FIGHTERS FOR PEACE who are the chief targets
of the McCarran Act, With its provisions for registration,
prison, ﬁnes, and concentration camps. To guarantee the
success of their imperial dream the Warmakers hack away
at America’s hard—Won civil liberties, rob the Worker of his
Wages through inﬂation and unbearable taxes and threaten
the peoples of the World with atomic ‘bombs. In their ef-
fort to discredit the crusade for peace Which perils their
plans they assert that these activities are proof of the So-
viet Union’s “indirect aggression” and that those who ﬁght
for peace are MoscoW’s agents. A

It is only in the light of events in Korea, Germany and
other focal points of intensifying War danger that the
McCarran Act, the Smith Act and similar thought-control
legislation can be fully understood. Only if the voices for
peace are stilled can the promoters of World War III
carry through their designs. It is clearly the aim of the
McCarranites to throttle all such voices, including that
of the Communist Party.

The American Civil Liberties Union has called the

McCarran Act “the greatest threat to general civil liberties

since the Alien and Sedition'Acts of 1798.” In its 1951
Report, the ACLU said the adoption of the McCarran
Act was the “Worst departure. since 1798 from the central
principle of American law that a man is accountable only
for his own illegal acts, not for mere association with per-
sons Who hold obnoxious opinions.” It summarized the
current Witchhunt atmosphere in these Words:

“There is a growing inclusive and pervasive social

_atmosphere of fear and intolerance, stiﬂing the good old,

American habits of speaking one’s mind, joining the organ-
izations one believes in, and observing the principle of fair
hearing and of holding a man innocent until he is proved
guilty. Guilt by association or—Worse——by innuendo, is

abroad in the land.”

“Eternal Vigilance I 3 the Price
of Liéerzfy’ ’———f e ﬂerson

WHEN HERMANN GOERING set ﬁre to the Reichstag and
pinned the blame on the Communists, millions of Ger-
mans told themselves that life for them could go on just
the same. But the onslaught did not stop With the Com-
munists. That Was but the ﬁrst step in the destruction of
all German rights and of the degradation of the German
people. Members of trade unions, liberals, paciﬁsts,
Catholics, the Jewish people, were all marked for terror
and annihilation. The fascist mentality became an object

‘ of horror and loathing tothe peoples of the World.

It is necessary to recall this recent history, Which those
Who want to do today the job the Hitler gang almost

43

succeeded in doing on the World, are trying to make us
forget.

President Truman, tongue—in—cheek, said in his mes~
sage Vetoing the McCarran iAct—-which was promptly
enacted by his Democratic maj ority, plus his Republican
co—Workers: “The application of the registration require-
ments to the Communist-front organizations can be the
greatest danger to freedom of speech, press and assembly,
since the Alien and Sedition laws of 1798.”

Millions in our land are beginning to grasp the mean-
ing of these Words—-even if the man who uttered them
did so for his own purposes.

Events are moving rapidly. But Americans who prize
their rights—to think, to Vote, to Worship, to Work, to have
friends, to live Without danger of persecution, can still
halt the attack.

It is the clear duty of Americans to spread the truth
about the McCarran Act and take measures to stop its en-
croachments on the Bill of Rights and the other freedoms
guaranteed in the Constitution’ of the United States.
Those who are Wrecking our liberties in the name of
liberty must be halted now.

“REPEAL THAT LAW!”

At the time the McCarran bill was up for passage it was
vigorously opposed by many inﬂuential organizations and
groups, including the American Federation of Labor, the
Congress of Industrial Organizations, the Railroad
Brotherhoods, and many independent unions. Opposition
to the measure also came from the American Civil Liber-
ties Union, the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, the American Jewish Congress, Ameri-
cans for Democratic Action, the National Farmers Union,
the American Veterans Committee, the League of United
Synagogues, the Bar Association of New York, the Na-
tional Lawyers Guild.

Religious groups which regarded the McCarran legis-
lation as a threat to all Americans included the Episcopal
League for Social Action and the Friends Committee on
National Legislation. In June, 1952, more than 500 dele-
gates, speaking for 84,500 church members at the annual
conference of the American Unitarian Association in Bos-
ton, denouneed the McCarran Act, branding it as “a major
instrument of fear and intimidation, inhibiting many from
speaking out on the issues of the day.” Bishop Francis
Haas of Michigan spoke up against the measure, as did
such prominent Americans as Governor Bonner of Mon-
tana, Governor Johnson of Colorado, Prof. Zechariah

4-5

 

Chafee of Harvard, Prof. Fowler Harper of Yale, former
Chancellor Robert M. Hutchins of the University of
Chicago, and Councilman Stanley M. Isaacs of New York.
The passage of the McCarran-Act was opposed by both
the AFL and CIO, and scores of individual labor leaders.
Frank Rosenblum, Secretary-Treasurer of the Amal-
gamated Clothing Workers of America, was one of the
initiators of the National Committee to Repeal the Mc-
Carran Act. The Amalgamated has urged all joint boards
and members of the 400,000 member union to go on.
record in favor of the Sabath Bill (HR. 3118) calling
for the repeal of the McCarran Act and to notify their
respective Senators and Congressmen of their action.
Strong opposition to the law has come from Hugo
Ernst, president of the Hotel, Restaurant and Bartenders

A .International, AFL. Speaking of the McCarran and Smith

Acts, Ernst expressed the hope that-“there will be enough
voices raised to delete these obnoxious laws from, our
statute books)’ .

Hitting at the concentration camp provisions of the Mc-
Carran Act, Ernst wrote in the oﬂicial journal of the
union: “The camps may be intended for Communists to-
day. They can be used for ‘non—Communist liberals’ and
trade unionists tomorrow.” 0

The movement for repeal is growing, with three
-congressmen taking the lead on Capitol Hill. They are
John Blatnik (D.-Minn.), Herman P. Eberharter (D.-
.Penn.), and Emanuel Celler (D.—N They are back-
ing the campaign launched by the National Committee for
the Repeal of the McCarran Act which is concentrating
-on H.R. 3118, the bill providing for repeal of the law
:introduced by Rep. Adolph J. Sabath (D.—Ill.).,

INTRODUCTION

MANY ARE the avenues along which the fascists seek the destruc-
tion of democratic rights and multicolored is the clothing in which
fascism attires itself. The McCarran Act, with its threat against
freedom of thought and organization, is in the Hitlerite style. Its
essence is the outlawing of progressive organizations; a familiar
Nazi feature of the law is the provision for concentration camps.
The outlawing of people’s organizations we have seen before in
our country. The concentration camps on the present scale are,
for Americans, something new. 1

As happened in Nazi Germany, the first organization attacked
is the Communist Party. With this party arbitrarily, and amid a
great wave of hysteria led by the Government, falsely stigmatized

by the Attorney General as “a foreign agent,” the path is opened '

for persecution of countless progressive groups, trade unions and
fraternal organizations which the government will seek to label
“Communist—fronts.”

But the plans of the American imitators of Hitler can be ‘blocked.
While the government’s model is that of Nazi Germany, our
model must be the outraged wrath with which the American peo-
ple organized and wiped the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts of
the l79Q’s off the statute books. Even President Truman, with
unabashed hypocrisy, was impelled to acknowledge that, “The
application of the registration requirements to the Communist-
front organizations can be the greatest danger to freedom of
speech, press and assembly, since the Alien and Sedition Laws of
1798.”

paign against the McCarran Act and its iniquitous‘ provisions

and shady tax rebate deals 5 this “case” involves history,
ideology, world policy, theories of social organization,
all of which is as uninteresting to the court reporter as it
is to the Government attorneys.

Fresh copies of house rules are laid out neatly each
morning. They politely ask that hearings be conducted
“With the same. dignity, decorum and adherence to the
relevant issues as is customary in court rooms.” Rule 3
says that spectators Who cannot ﬁnd seats may not remain
in the hearing room and that there are to be no spectators
standing. This is academic when nearly 100 seats are gen-
erally unoccupied. .

The rules also forbid Wire recording, the running of

‘sound tracks .for public broadcasting or distribution, “or

television operation Within the hearing room at" any time.”

Rule 5 assures that “exclusive space is provided for
members ‘of the press Who may desire to attend the hear-
ing.” This Writer Was all alone at the press table. Fuller
coverage of the proceedings was assured only when ap-
propriations for the Board Were pending in Congress. On
that occasion newspapers and press agencies Were tipped oﬁ‘
“something hot” was in the oﬂing. The sensation turned
out to be a Warmed—over story by a paid FBI informer
who first did his routine three years ago. Apart from infre-
quent episodes like these, the press has found the proceed-

, ings undramatic and this is just vvhat the McCarranites

    

desire.
The “Quiet” Hearing

THERE IS A CURIOUS, UNREAL C-JAILM in Room 1 13. No one
is physically threatened, no guns are brandished. All is

6

 

bland and unruﬂled, only the sound of Words and the shuf-
ﬂing of exhibits.

Do you know What has been happening in this quiet
hearing room in the RFC building in the nation’s capital?
Acting by authority of the McCarran Act (“The _Internal
Security Act of 1950”) the Subversive Activities Control
Board has been conducting hearings to prove that the
Communist Party of the United States is a “Communist
action” organization, dominated and controlled by the
Soviet Union. Later the board will get on to other, less-
publicized organizations and groups which Will be tabbed
“Communist fronts,” controlled by the Communist Party
of the U.S.

Under the terms of the Act the SACB must be com-
posed of ﬁve members appointed by the President and
conﬁrmed by the Senate, and serving for staggered terms
of three years. The law says that not more than three
members shall belong to the same political party. The

_ board started in 1950 With ﬁve members. The original

chairman, Seth W. Richardson, resigned, giving ill health
as the reason, after he had Waited months for Senate con-
ﬁrmation. There are 26 persons, connected With the
SACB, on the public payroll: four members of the
panel 5 a general counsel, at stalf analyst, an “informa-

‘ tion oﬁ’icer” and secretarial and clerical assistants. Each

board member gets $12,500 a year in salary.* The board’s
chief counsel also gets lush pay. And the Attorney Gen-
eral has put a dozen of his legal staff on the job to push
this-.case and they, too, are handsomely rewarded. No
cause for concern, it all comes out of the public treasury,
and the total expenditure is paltry in comparison With the

 

‘Large pay increases are in the oﬂing.

    

  

65 billion dollar U.S. war budget which the McCarranites
are supporting.

The law as framed convicts the organization now get-
ting a “hearing” in advance, for the McCarran Act passed
by Congress declared the Communists to be “foreign
agents.”

The character of the board and the pressures exerted to
guarantee the verdict refute its pretense of impartiality.
The members of the Subversive Activities Control Board
have to be conﬁrmed on the recommendation of the Senate
Judiciary Committee whose chairman, Senator Pat McCar-
ran, is himself the author of the Act which spawned the
board.

McCarran’s name has become synonymous with union-
busting as the witchhunters of his Senate sub—committee
swarm over the country. When all other efforts to destroy
a union have failed,‘ McCarran’s squad comes to the

 

rescue. The assault on the New York teachers is the most ‘

recent example.

The former chairman of the board, ex—Rep. Charles
LaFollette, one—time head of the anti—Communist Ameri-
cans for Degnocratic Action, failed of conﬁrmation because
his methods were apparently not completely acceptable.
Mr. LaFollette at one point quit as panel chairman, while
awaiting conﬁrmation by the U.S. Senate, with a sizzling
statement on May 24-, 1951. One panel member, it ap-
pears, had shown “evident disdain” for the chairman and
“his method of conducting the case.”

Said Mr. LaFollette in his valedictory, “We will have
speedier hearings, I am sure, because the panel member,
Mr. Brown, whom I have asked to preside from now on,
has already evidenced the remarkable capacity to make

8

speedy rulings upon all objections presented to this panel.

'. . . The fact that they almost uniformly amount to a

sustaining of any position taken by the petitioner [Attor-
ney General] and a rejection of any position taken by the
respondent [Communist Party], is purely coincidental, I
am sure.”

Judge‘ and Jury

THE- CURRENT PANEL Was conﬁrmed only after ﬁve
months of hearings had convinced the McCarranites that
it Was a safe bet. Thus the same Senate committee that
authored the law and Wrote in its built—in verdict is,
through its appointees, sitting in judgment on evidence
at the hearings. i

The panel as now constituted consists of Peter Camp-

’ bell Brown, a Brooklyn Democrat and one—time Depart-

ment of Justice staffer, who presides, and Miss Kathryn
McHale, Ph.D. Her brother, Frank M. McHale, Demo-
cratic national committeeman from Indiana, succeeded
in getting his man, Frank McKinney*, named as national
chairman of the Democratic party after the hasty resig-
nation of William Boyle in the midst of RFC scandals.
Both McHale and McKinney have been under ﬁre for
making $68,000 proﬁt on investments of $1,000 each
in a tractor company. In April of this year another mem-
ber was added, Watson B. Miller, a top-brass Legionnaire.
The fourth member of the panel, David Coddaire, is a
one—time member of the U.S. Maritime Commission.

Dr. McHale’s conduct, at least outside the hearing
room, has been considerably less than judicial. A speech
