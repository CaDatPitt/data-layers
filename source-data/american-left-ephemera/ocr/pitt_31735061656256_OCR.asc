SALUTE TO A BLACK PATRIOT

HAll..: JAMES JOHNSON JR.; Black lV1an;Blacl<Worl<er; Black Hero; Black Patriot. "Ildl

the name of Bro. James Johnson to the illustrous list of Black workers who have, in -he

formior another, sacrificed beyond call to advance the principle of Black autons ny.

towards gaining enough leverage so as to eradicate the pernicious placement of Bis tks

within the entire labor family. The names ring out like golden coins: Bro Rushie Fcuge,
Bro. Chuck Wooten, Bro. Sid Lewis, Bro. Ike Jemigan ~ and now (in unyielding colii::’on_
with industrial harrassment strides Bro. James Johnson Jr.). These heroic Black Broti‘ ere‘: ‘
epitomize the infinite frustrations in which all Black and Colonized workers are daily v-Q

drowned was they attempt to earn the meager substances that serve merely to keep fannlies
off the welfare rolls. These brothers are united by one common distortion, a varia.’on
common to all Third World and poor workers; they are powerless to deal directly with
the authors, the initial sources of industrial atrocities — the industrialists. For standing
between them and justice are the sell out Trade Unions. But these Brothers dared to act,

to lash out at oppressive conditions, to express dissatisfaction with unresponsive urf-on

postures, to eliminate, in some fashion, the proxies of the industrialist exploiter.

On April 26, James Johnson will stand before the bars of justice (T?) to cleterminei ‘ it

whether he will be allowed to be a freed man (freedom came for Bro. James whet": he
dared to act) or whether he will be further incarcerated by the guilty, blood stained
captains of industry - the present‘ rulers of the universe. Bro. James is charged with

murder and perhaps it is true that he eradicated obnoxious perpetrators of induystriaiist 

barbarisms. But the tale is much deeper than that, the story spans farbeyond the death of

three people, far beyond a merger of state punitive forces directed at one who had stood If

his fill of facist conducted genocide. The story is as old as Black/white relations. The

plight of Bro. James characterizes the similar plight of all Blacks residing within the racist 

fascist confines of the empire building western hemisphere. For it is a historicalfact that
present day Blacks resiclin'g on this continent are’ the sons of Blacks who were the

"wards"~ of an older and not less cruel set of masters -— the planters. And it is also a 

historical fact that because of the blood bath that took place between the sons of Europe,
who were in direct economic opposition , "economic opposition" that led to horrendous
struggle (planters versus industrialists) Blacks in America who had participated in this the

2nd struggle for liberation to take place on -these shores —— the fight against British v_-

lmperialism in which Blacks had been the first to participate?— merely traded off onese,
of masters for another. And it was for the letter that Bro. James had toiled’ in‘the_20_tlj
century slavery; that set of depraved abusers of humanity who pay homage to Capital and
Capital alone. I h - A ‘ — ‘V — -’ l

 
 

ro. ames after having toiled in contemporary slavery for the Chrysler Corporation
la recipient of major defense contracts to assist in the genocide of the Vietnamese people)
some three years, finally, after months of personal heckling, arrived at his saturation
point and found it necessary toresolve manners in a very revolutionary way. After
surviving an especially appalling period of management desecrations —~ layoffs, speedups,
a worsening of already dangerous safety conditions, and various other forms of
intimidations ~— and after enduring a personal vendetta from mercenary agents of currupt
higher—ups, and after barely escaping with his life from an automobile accident, and after
being ordered back to work before complete recovery by venal medical authorities in the
employ of Chrysler Corporation . . . (Bro. James had taken a vacation that was previously
granted him and upon his return to work after this two week holiday (recuperation)

found himself discharged; the dismissal was such a flagrant violation of existing policies
that even without union representation the company was “forced" to reinstate Brother
James; it was at this point that the personal harrassment to Bro. James speeded, up to the
extent that the only camparable basis for establishing a parallel was the speedup of the
conveyor on which he toiled at breakneck speed) ; and after being removed from this job
to one of an even greater physical liability (and discomfort), removed only to be replaced
by a new hire-in, Bro. James shrieked his displeasure for which he was suspended with
union representation in attendance; So, on July 15, 1970 Bro. James left the plant a
suspended worker and returned —— an armed guerilla; the final result was —— THREE DEAD

MEN.

But as adverse as the described conditions were, Bro. James‘ case cannot, must not,
be accurately protrayed from this limited scope. For Bro. James is a Black man residing in
racist white America —— within the Black colony. And this runaway slave has traveled the
entire circuit: born in the south, servant for the Armed Forces, and escaped to —- THE
GHETTO. A victim of the usual inferior educational system, inadequate housing, poor
medical facilities, a victim of, in a word, RACISM, American style. Attempting to support
an aunt and a sister, Bro. James’ employment was more than important to him -— it was
essential for the very survival of he and his family. And, perhaps all the manifestations of
Racism, the emasculation of minority males, along with the special brand of cruelty being
meted out to him in particular, temporarily drove him past the point of sanity . . . .

‘But faced with the hideous conditions of the Wayne County Jail, of which James
has been a resident since that ill-fated day, soon turned him away from the twilight zone
back into the realm of normalcy. Residing in that pig sty of a jail along with some one
thousand (1,000) other inmates, mostly kidnapped from the streets of the Black colony,

 

and various other uninvited guests (rats, roaches, bedbugs, etc.) Bro. James soon revealed '

his true revolutionary spirit. Bro. James, just for the record, has of yet to be "convicted"
of anything but because of his lack of status in this racist society he has had to assume
the role of "CONVlCT" for over eight months. No bail. But thenewly born revolutionary

‘-spirit that has laid claim to him would not let him alone, would not permit him to sit idly .

» ‘by to be further‘ victimized without putting up a fight, and so in conjunction with six
' other persecuted persons (Michaei Harris, Lawrence R. Plamondon, Norman Richardson,

Carolyn Traylor, and Nora Ware) James has filed suit against the Wayne County Board of
Commissioners, Sherrif Lucas, and various other and sundry functionaries challenging the
right of the county to inhabit . "sh people that crummy hovel that right from the top

 

violates nine (9) State Housing 82 Health Codes. This hideous monstrosity of a ...hacl:.
erected inthe roaring twenties where persons are placed in 6 X 8 cages in som;'.1ime;:
tandems of three (two to sleep on hard cots and the other on the urine saturated floors)

So a free man goes to trial to see if his new founded freedom will be exercised in
the midst of this explosive, racist society or at the lowest hub, the very nadir of a
civilization subterranean in context. While, at one and the same time, the true criminals,
those persons who must accept the responsibility for (And thank God for fighting Black
men) the continuous development of James Johnsons throughout the length and breadth
of this foul land lie back, far removed from the sordidness of the whole messy affair, lie
back, and insist on the full forces of the law (their law) being brought to bear. 8- t let
them sleep on in their complacency if they will. For that list, that illustrous list of heroic
Black workers shall‘ continue to grow, andin a minute, in a minute we shall all be Jsrnes
Johnsons, we shall all arrive at where reality is. Long Live Brother James Johnson; Long
Live Black Workers in This Racist Land. And, in all honesty, how many of us have had

that urge, have had to repress that urge, that urgeto strike out, to fight back against the’

inhumane system that annually kills some thousands of Black workers, that breaks the
spirits of some hundreds of thousands, and that, finally, mentally enslaves”the entire
population to a rottr.-rt drxzadent reality of  nightmare? Hail Brother James Johnson —
REVOLUTlONlST. He dared to struggle; He "dares” to win.
