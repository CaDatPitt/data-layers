to make it more convenient, the moral effect of the present law regulating this department of our propaganda
will be destroyed because violated. From information coming through correspondence I draw these conclusions,
that the comrades appreciate the value of our law to protect the organization against "free lancing," but seem
to object to it because of the intervention of the third party, which makes it more or less cumbersome to
them. The recent referendum was sustained simply because the locals did not wish to abolish the law in
its entirety, but it must be understood that the comrades do not all approve of the law as it now stands.
It was only for fear that we would again revert back to the wild-cat, free-lancing methods which were ex-
perienced in former years that this law was not repealed. As a substitute for the present law 1 would rec-
ommend to this convention that the law be so revised that it will be more agreeable to the locals as well
as to the speakers, and at the same time protect our organization. All speakers should have the endorsement
of the State Executive Committee, who should review the qualiﬁcations and fitness of such speakers, then
we can consider such a settled matter, then when any local wishes to have speakers, that they select those
that they might prefer from this list of duly qualiﬁed speakeis and after the agreement has been made
between the local and the speaker as to date, etc., that the State ofﬁce should then be notified by both speak-
er as well as the local so as to avoid any conflict in date. At the same time this will afford the state See-
retary an opportunity to reach any speaker at any time when it becomes necessary. This is the only demo-
cratic way in dealing with the speakers, and it avoids any partiality on the part of the State officials in
the routing of certain speakers. Besides, the speakers will feel a responsibility, knowing that he or she
must have the endorsement of the State Executive Committee in order to work within the State. It gives
the local an opportunity to also satisfy their own desires and the State is not to blame if the meetings do not
prove a success. At the present time there are many speakers on the available list, which proves the interest
taken in this department of our work. On ‘August ﬁrst there were but four speakers on the available list,
and it was necessary to advertise in The Bulletin that speakers were needed. This list has steadily grown
until there are now nineteen whose names and addresses are published in The Bulletin. it is the wish of
the State office that we encourage our local State speakers by assisting them whenever possible, but it be-
comes necessary at times that we employ speakers irom outside the State. There is a diversity of opinion
as to whether the sub-plan or the regular plan of routing speakers is. the better, and from .all indications 1
would suggest that it is best to permit‘ this to run its course so long as it does not conﬂict with the laws
regulating speakers.

Organization and Political suggestions.

Since there are a great many differences on the question of organization, and most all being good and‘

well intended, I feel that it is best to leave this matter to the Committee‘on Organization and Propaganda.
However, it might be in order to suggest that a Standing Committee on By-Laws and Platform be elected
and that this committee attend to this particular duty alone. This committee should be limited to two or
three so as to eliminate the danger of losing such documents, as much as possible, through mailing, if the
work is to be done by correspondence. ' .

Besides the possibilities of losing these valuable papers, the sending of such bulky matter by mail is too
cumbersome. It must also be realized that it would be impossible to send all of the various platforms and
by-laws over the State through the mails. With the great movement that we now have and which is ever
growing, comes with it the necessary changes in order to meet the requirements of, and which are neces-
sary for the proper conducting of our affairs. The above proposition can be facilitated in three different
ways—by a committee elected bythe membership to attend to such duties, or that a sub-committee elected
by the members of the State Executive Committee from that body, but it seems to me that there should be
a code to cover at least the principal requirements of our party, this to be made universal, but it should be
so drawn up that those questions relating to local affairs can be added, providing such items do not conﬂict
with the provisions of our constitution.

Assistance is also solicited by the State office in the matter of getting up a list of simpliﬁed instruc-
tions to guide the many inquirers seeking information as to how to proceed to get their tickets in the ﬁeld
in accordance with the provisions of the new primary law, and such other matters that will assist the party
membership along this line.

' - rlnanolal conditions of the State Organization.

On August 1, 1910, after the committee—Comradees Dan P. Farrell and Joseph Quill—had~audited the
books, a balance of ninety-two dollars and seventy-one cents ($92.71) was declared, but there were outstand-
ing bills enough to reduce -this amount to forty—one dollars and ninety-three cents ($41.93) deﬁcit against the
treaury after all bills were paid. This indebtedness was disposed of and the funds have steadily increased
until -we have reached the sum of $1',060 surplus in the State treasury up to April 1; It is hoped that this
amount will be used in the great. ﬁght that is before us in this State during the coming campaign.

It is the opinion of the State Secretary that the enemy will concentrate its forces to ﬁght our movement -

in Ohioon account of the progress that our party has made. Our treasury is at present in a healthy con-
dition to at least afford us a means of resistance in the next campaign. This ought to be used for the purpose
of getting out literature-and speakers to cover the entire State. -

The next ﬁght will be the hardest battle ever waged by our party in this State and our funds ought to
be used principally for this purpose. ‘

Retaining $65.00, amount to be returned at any time to Local Dayton. ‘
In conclusion I wish to say that the entire State movement is in good order with the exception of Local

Day ton.

This affair has been more or less annoying tthe state office during my entire administration, and

which dates back a number of years during the administration of former secretaries. It is to be hoped that this

convention will clear up this matter by thoroughly investigating all charges and reports concerning the at-

fairs.

As the matter now stands the State Secretary is thoroughly convinced that Local Dayton should be

made to understand that the State organization is larger than any local and should always be respected as
such. However, this is a matter to be settled by the convention and 1 will not linger longer on this question.
Another question which I wish to mention is the fact that 1 am not a candidate for re-election to the office
of State Secretary. Thanking you for your kind attention, I am.

AN ERROR.

The Socialists are in-

the State Executive Committee action of suspending
Local Dayton be made the ﬁrst order of business after
permanent organization, at which time the State Exec-
utive Committee and the Local Dayton delegates be al-
lowed to present their arguments.
(Signed) H. L. ARNOLD, Chairman.
WILLIAM PATTERSON,
TOM CLIFFORD,
,E-. E. ADEL,

LAWRENCE A. ZITT, Secretary.
On motion, report of Committee on Credentials is
received. ‘

Chairman Henderson callébfor election of permanent
chairman for the day.

Comrade James H. Henderson, of Columbusis then
elected permanent chairman.

Comrades Dan McCartan, of Coshocton, and E. C.
Eby, of Columbus, elected to act in conjunction as per-
manent secretaries.

Convention then proceeds to consider the question of
the suspension of Local. Dayton in accordance with
recommendations of Committee on Credentials.

Motion by.Vernia, of East Liverpool: That this con-
vention ‘does not concur in the action taken by the‘
State Executive Committee in suspending Local Dayton.

Amendment by Willert, of Cleveland: That no ac-
tion be taken until all testimony has been heard.
Amendment carried.

State Secretary Storck is given the ﬂoor and tells
of reasons for‘the suspension of Local Dayton.

He says that “The State Executive Committee took
vote on question of suspending Local Dayton and Dan
P. Farrell in order to give all sides a fair hearing, and
that E. E._ Adel stated that he would refuse to serve
on the investigating committee if the general affairs
of Local Dayton were to be investigated.

He stated that he was requested to turn over certain
official documents to the investigating committee and
that they had not been returned, the committee stat-
ing that they had been lost; also that a minute book
which had been in the hands of a comrade who had
died could‘ not be found, but that book had ﬁnally been
found as so stated in a letter from Comrade Thornton,
of Dayton, to Comrade Adel, of Columbus, which had
been opened by mistake by Comrade Storck.

He then reads a copy of letter, purporting to be from
Dan P. Farrel, of Dayton, to E. E. Adel, of Columbus,
containing a plan to prevent meeting of the State Ex-
ecutive Committee: .

March 2, 1911.

Dayton, Ohio.
E. E. Adel,
Dear Comrade:

There will be a meeting of the S. E. C. next Sat-
urday and an effort may be made to shutme out
and if possible I want to prevent such an act by
the committee, and if I can get the assistance of
two other members of the committee I can do it,
or there will be no meeting; and if there should be
ai'meeting it will be with only four members. I
will give you my plan and if you think it is the
best thing to do I want you to get in touch with
Merz‘ and instruct him how to handle the propo-
sition, or if you can suggest a. better plan, I want
you to. write me in a day or two.

Plan:

I want to take part in committee meeting just
as heretofore. In other words, I DO NOT WANT
THE COMMITTEE TO GRANT ME THE RIGHT
TO TAKE PART IN THE MEETING. Should all
the members be present and they attempt to shut
me out, MERZ SHOULD DECLARE THE MOTION
OUI‘ OF ORDER (this should be after I have the
chance to question them as to their authority to
shut me out), then if they overrule Merz’s decision.
MERZ AND BURKE WITH MYSELF SHOULD
LEAVE THE ROOM AND REFUSE TO TAKE
PART IN THE MEETING. If a full committee is
present it would only leave four at'the meeting;

' if one of our oponents should be absent it would

only leave three and they could hold no meeting.

I EXPECT TO SEE" COMRADE BURKE BEFORE
THE "MEETING AND EXPLAIN THE PROPOSI-
TION TO HER.

Let me know what you think of the proposition.

Yours for Socialism,
DAN P. FARRELL.

man Henderson:

Motion by Comrade Patterson, of Toledo:
special committee on resolutions regarding the kid-
naping of McNamara and McManigal be given the ﬂoor.
Motion carried.

Committee submits following resolutions:

Resolutions No. 2.

The Socialist Party of Ohio in convention assem-
bled declare the kidnaping of the two McNamaras
and McManigal by the Burns Detective Associa-
tion to be another Moyer—Haywood and Pettibone
case.

In loud and unmistakable tones we denounce the
kidnaping of workingmen, denying them their con-
stitutional and legal rights and railroading them
from one state into another.

These men‘ were taken from the same State which

shielded ex-Governor Taylor, of Kentucky, a fugi- J

tive from justice, and taken to California. where
prejudice against unionism runs high.

We declare that workingmen are not equal with
capitalists under the law and until the working
class gains control of the powers of government
they will be discriminated against in the interests
of the class in control. .

We call upon the workers of the United States
to rally to the defense of these men and to stigma-
tize their treatment as a blow aimed at organized

That i

That the ‘

labor, and in the interests of the enemies of or-

ganized labor. . _
We call upon the working class everywhere to
organize industrially and politically and by the
power of organization to force the ‘already totter-
ing and frightened p.owers of capitalism to ‘rec-
ognize the demands of labor and ﬁnally and~u1ti-
mately to thus force'the overthrowof capital-ism
with its inequalities and injustices, and in its stead
establish the rule of men. P . '

Resolution No. 8.

MUNICIPAL PROGRAM
Adopted by the Ohio State Convention,
April 30, 1911. \

The ﬁrst consideration in all municipal affairs
should be the interests of the working class. The
Socialist Party is not organized to elect good men
to office, but to-control the powers of political gov-
ernment in order to guarantee to the workers the
possession and operation of the means of produc-
tion and distribution and the full social product
of their labor. Various issues will arise in the
communities of Ohio, and the Socialist Party stands
ﬁrmly for the rights 0 the producing class. The
party daclares: . ,

1. For the initiative, referendum and recall in
municipal affairs. '

2. The public ownership of all public utilities.
For the abolishing of the contract system in pub-
lic improvements and the doing of all such work
by the municipality direct.

3. For the eight-hour day, for all laborers em-
ployed on public improvements and in municipal
departments. ' I '

4. For the rigid inspection of workshops, fac-
tories and places of public assembly.

For the enforcement of the laws to protect
the lives of workers while. engaged in industries.

6. For the best sanitary conditions in tenements
and elsewhere. .

7. For parks and playgrounds located within
reach of the workers.

For free text-books in public schools.

9. For the free administration of justice, and
the appointment of a public “de"ender” as well as
a prosecutor, as at present. ‘ '

The enforcement of the legal requirements
as to weights and measures. R

SECRETARY STORCK’S REPORT.

Columbus, Ohio, April 15, 1911.
go‘thedDelegates of the Socialist Party, State of Ohio, in Convention Assembled: _
omra es— ‘

In accordance with the provisions of the State Constitution of Ohio that an annual report shall be ren-
dered by the State Secretary of ﬁnancial and other affairs of the party for the year preceding the conven-
tion, and in view of this fact, a moral as well as voluntary duty requires that in addition to the above pro-
vision it should be expedient for me to give a just and honest statement as near correct as it is consistent
with the above requirements.

I deem it best to divide my report into seven sections so as to take care of each division as much as
possible. They are as follows: ‘

Requirements of the Constitution.

Duties.

Accomplishments.

Importance of.the Ohio Socialist Bulletin.

The speaker ‘ proposition.

Organization and Political Suggestions, and the
Financial Conditions of the State Organization.

Constitution. \

It is the opinion of the State Secretary that the State Constitution should be so revised as to make it a
stable program to work by. The present wording of the law of the constiution is so that it can be inter-
preted in various ways, which is not only confusing to those who choose to do right, but it also gives “lee-
way” to those who have ulterior motives, and inasmuch as We have ample time in the four days that we will
be assembled here, we can redraft this document and make it at least substantial enough to afford a medium
to guide our party in the future, or at least up to such time when it becomes necessary to again revise it.
I suggest that special care should be taken in doing this. _ 0

:';§'.:- ;1 I ! » Duties. ' .

It is not my wish to reflect in any way upon the past by showing up the present condition of. our State
movement. My better judgment tells me that all secretaries must have had a just-pride in ‘the accom-
plishments of their respective administrations. All have worked hard of course, some harder than others,
but as ,a rule all have done well under existing circumstances. ’

The task of serving a revolutionary organization can only be realized when we are acting in some ca-
pacity or are in responsible positions of such an organization. Whatever has been accomplished within the
last nine months just passed, was done in the spirit of co-operation and good will, and which did not depend
upon the superior qualiﬁcations of your State Executive Committee nor any individual, nor did it depend
upon anyindividual local within the State, but it was by united and concerted action of all the members, the
unusual activity of the Socialist press, the lecturers and campaigners, but best of all the committees of agi-
tators and workers in the movement. This has brought Ohio to the fore as the greatest Socialist State in
the Union. There is not another State in the Union that can compare with Ohio in a more even distribution
of locals over the State. All this was done. by the comrades in the spirit of duty to one another, the State
and to the Nation. .

Accomplishments.

Beginning April 1st, 1910, up to August 1st, nineteen. locals were organized. These were taken in during
the administration of former or acting State Secretary Comrade E. E. Adel. Beginning August 1st to April
27th, 1911, 91 locals were taken in, averaging ten locals per month for the past nine months. A great num-
ber of these locals were organized by Comrade A. B. Shinn, who was employed as organizer in the unor-
ganized territory most of the time, and who is now devoting part of his time to this work. About ten of
this total number of locals could not weather the storms of capitalism and dropped out, leaving about 81
of the new locals to aid in the ﬁnal overthrow of capitalism. This is a result of the last nine months’ work.
The membership has steadily increased and the reported number of members afﬁliated with the organiza-
tion reach nearly 6,500. There are now all told 190 locals in the State. ~

Importance of Ohio Socialist Bulletin.

The Ohio Socialist Bulletin is a necessary appendage to our State organization and has grown to such
importance that most locals insist -on having,a full quota of copies, and usually make it known when an in-
sufficient number has been sent out to supply the members of their locals. .However, there is a consider-
able amount of labor connected with it and the expense of mailing it has become quite an item, the size has
been incrased from six to eight pages within the last eight or nine months and the number of copies printed
for distribution has increased from 3,500 to 5,500 copies per month. An effort was made to have it admitted
for second—class mailing privileges, but the postoflice ofﬁcials could not consider the proposition unless some
popular subscription price be placed upon it; in other words, they insist that The Bulletin must have some
intrinsic value of its own. If suggestions are in order relative to this matter I would recommend that the
convention take up this question so as to make it possible to take advantage of the privileges allowed to
other publications, as well as organizations. To abolish The Bulletin would really be foolish and would
meet with universal disapproval by our party membership in Ohio. .

The Speaker Proposition.

The question of speakers and the routing of them has been our greatest task and as yet I have been un-

. able to learn of any successful plan of doing this work. One of the greatest difficulties realized is the fact
that most locals insist on Sunday dates, as this is themost suitable time for comrades to attend such meet-
ings. Many of the locals are somewhat handicapped because of the fact that available meeting places can
only be secured on this day. This circumstance is unavoidable insofar as the locals are concerned, yet this
fact complicates matters to such an extent that it would require the entire time of some one in the State to
attend to this alone. The membership has again proven by the referendum recently taken regarding speakers
that all speakers must be routed by the State ofﬁce, and unless the law is so altered or rather amended so as
