TI-IE COMMUNIST WAY
VERSUS HUEY LONG

By ALEX B|1"|'E|.MAN

A “Such a government would immediately begin to reorganize
the present anarchic system of production along Socialist lines.
It would eliminate the untold waste of capitalism; it would bring
to full use the tremendous achievements of science, which have ‘
been pushed aside by the capitalist rulers from consideration of
private proﬁt. Such a Socialist reorganization of industry would
almost immediately double the existing productive forces of the
country.” (Manifesto of the Eighth Convention of the Communist
Party of the U.S.A.)

And as this process of socialist reorganization proceeds u'p- Qt,
ward, wealth is reproduced and increased to unheard of propor- 
tions. But this is socialist wealth, not private capitalist any more. \
Hence, the standard of living of all toilers rises to heights in com-
parison with which the schemes played with by Long and Cough-
lin will look puny indeed.

But It Can't Be Done Without a Socialist Revolution ,

Assume for the moment that Huey Long has secured as much
power in the United States as he now has in Louisiana; and that,
contrary to what he is doing in Louisiana, he would actually try
to carry through his “share-our-wealth” plan for the country as
a whole. That is, you assume that an attempt would be mad<.%
a serious attempt-—to try to abolish poverty withouta socialist
revolution as advocated by the Communist Party.

What would happen? K

Huey Long’s government promulgates the capital levy. It
calls upon Henry Ford, Rockefeller, and the other large fortune

~ holders, to surrender to the U. S. treasury that part of their for-
tunes which is above three or four million dollars. Long has
computed the value of the surplus of F ord’s and Rockefeller’s
fortunes that would go to the United States as being about twelve
billion dollars. That’s a pretty hefty sum to be gotten only from
two capitalists. ’ '

Meanwhile something would be happening on the Stock Ex- Y
changes. What would it be? A ﬁnancial panic. ‘Partly as a 1
result of deliberate selling out by the big fellows in an effort ‘to
embarrass the government, partly as a result of a real fright by
the smaller ones. This would at once produce a terriﬁc depre-

” ciation of all so-called capital values: bonds, stocks, etc. The
whole ﬁnancial and credit structure of American capitalist econ-
10 C

omy would go to pieces, and production itself would come to a
complete standstill. The twelve-billion-dollar surpluses gotten by
Long from Ford and Rockefeller won’t be worth the paper desig-
nating them. '

Hugh Johnson, knowing his Wall Street, says that much
himself.

“If you seized all property tomorrow by taxes and sold it at
an auction tax sale, nobody would have enough to bid a tenth of
its value. You would cut the price of America 90 per cent and
nobody but a foreigner would buy it.” (New York Times, March 5,
1935.)

What would Huey Long’s government do then? What did he
do in his own state when the Standard Oil Co. of Louisiana
(Rockefeller) refused to pay the ﬁve-cent tax on a barrel of oil
and undertook to organize civil war against Long’s government?
Why, Long compromised with Rockefeller and surrendered to
him. This was what Long did when confronted with a determined
opposition by Rockefeller to pay a tax, let alone surrender his
fortune. ,

Suppose, however, that in the case of the whole United States,
Long would not surrender but would undertake to carry through
his plan of “share-the-wealth”. What would he do in the face
of the ﬁnancial panic? What would he have to do? He would
have to close up the Stock Exchanges and nationalize the banks
and the credit structure of the country. This would already take
him beyond his present plan, which is merely to tax the large for-
tunes in a constitutional way. Incidentally, we have also assumed
that Long has disregarded the Supreme Court of the United States,
which certainly would declare his whole scheme unconstitutional.

But his troubles did not end: they have just begun.

He has now on his hands the banks and credit structure. Who
is going to manage it for him? If he should call in for this pur-
pose the same fellows whose surplus fortunes he is proposing
to confiscate, he would be putting himself and his whole scheme at
their mercy. That wouldn’t do. Hence he would have to build up
a governmental banking and credit organization operated by
people sincerely in favor of the “share-the-wealth” plan. This
takes him another couple of steps beyond his present plan. It is
not socialism yet, by a long shot, but it leads in the direction of

~ 11

 

socialism———-a direction in which Long says he does not want to go.

But if he means to “share-the-wealth”, he will have to. And
he will have to go further in the same direction.

For by having nationalized the banks he has only equipped
his government with the ﬁnancial powers to control industry p
which, after all, is the basic thing. How is he going to control —g
industry? On what basis? ‘

V Here we must recall again that Long’s present plan is out-, ,
spokenly against socialism. He says he will leave -the present ,
owners in possession of their industries, and they will have to
run the national economy. But at this point——-already minus the
banks. Will the owners of industry collaborate with Long’s / I
nationalized banking system? Hardly. They will sabotage for
all they are worth. They will do what Hugh Johnson says

i they will: '

“Nobody works or trades or manufactures except for proﬁt
or income. If you took that away by taxes, you would stop
activity, destroy employment and pauperize this country.” (New
Y or}: Times, March 5, 1935.)

And what would Huey Long do about it? Surrender or ﬁght?

If ﬁght, he would have to take another and longer step in the
direction of socialism. He would have to establish workers’ con-
trol of production and nationalize the means of production. He -
would have to put into effect another couple of planks from the
program of the Communist Party which he is now mobilizing to,
war against.

Closing the Stock Exchanges and nationalizing the banks, in-
evitable steps in any sincere move to carry out the capital levy
which Long speaks about, do not yet solve the problem. It only /=
stops the ﬁnancial panic and enables the government to control
industry through banking, provided the capitalists are willing to
collaborate with the government. But they won’t., ~r

The New York Times, an authoritative spokesman for big
capital, makes that clear beyond doubt. It says:

“Existing fortunes might be seized, but there would be no way
of reproducing them when the ordinary motives for enterprise and ,
labor and accumulation have been taken away.” (Editorial, 4
March 9, 1935.) }
12 I

 

This paper of big capital knows what it is talking about. It
says that when you take away from the capitalists the “ordinary
motives for enterprise”, that is, the proﬁt motive, the untrammeled
accumulation of capital for the exploitation of the masses, they
will sabotage and refuse to carry on. t \

Another spokesman of capital, a so-called “intellectual”, puts
the matter even more bluntly. He says:

“Let us suppose that the government under Huey Long’s plan
did own 99.8 per cent of the Ford Company and was therefore
entitled to 99.8 per cent of Mr. Ford’s proﬁts. What would happen
then? Would Mr. Ford and his son go on running the Ford plant
and producing the proﬁts? The senator ought to ask Mr. Ford. I
suspect that Mr. Ford would say to the government: ‘Well. now
you own all but two-tenths of one per cent of my business. You
run it and see how much proﬁt you can make.” (Walter Lipp-
inann, New York Herald Tribune, March 14, 1935.)

Mr. Lippmann, the beautiﬁer of capitalism, makes the capital-
ists here look too paciﬁst. Ford and the other exploiters of labor
won’t just say to the government, go ahead and run the business
yourself. No, not that. They will hold on to their business and
sabotage production; and they will organize war, real war, against
any government that would actually go through with a capital
levy that Long is playing with.

But we are running ahead of ourselves. We are still assuming
that Long means What he says; and we are trying to ﬁnd out what
difficulties he would buck up against and how he could overcome
them. To continue then.

We are at the point where the stock exchanges are closed up

‘for good and the banks nationalized, but production at ,a stand-

still because of the sabotage of the capitalists who still own the
means of production. What is the answer? The Communist
Party program——not Huey Long——gives the answer: workers’ con-
trol of production and immediate socialization of all large-scale
industry, * commerce and transportation.

“All former claims to ownership of the means of production,
including stocks, bonds, etc., would be- relegated to the museum,
with special provision to protect small savings. No public funds
would be paid out to anyone except for services rendered to the
community.” (Manifesto of the Eighth Convention of the Com.
munist Party of the U.S.A.)

13

 

This and this alone would solve the problem. Will Huey Long:
take this step? No, of course not. That would be introducing
socialism and by the only means possible——the means advocated
by the_Communist Party. But Long made it amply clear that he is
the deadly enemy of the Communist Party. He has put forward
his “share-the-wealth” plan as a means of combatting the socialist
plan of the Communist Party. He said that his plan was “the

~ only defense this country’s got against Communism”. (New York,

Times, March 9, 1935.)

What is the conclusion? The conclusion is: Long does not

«mean what he says. He says he stands for the abolition of poverty

but attacks the only plan, the Communist plan, which can realize

i this objective.

And another conclusion: There is much similarity between
Long’s promises to share the wealth and Hitler’s promises (before
he came to power) to introduce socialism, National-Socialism.

Hitler promised socialism to the German masses but attacked the K

Communist way——-the only way———of achieving socialism. Long
promises to “share-the-wealth”, which is a utopian and meaning-
less phrase without socialism, but attacks socialism and the Com-

‘ munist Party which ﬁghts for it.

Why should the masses in America think that Long is better
than Hitler? Why shouldn’t we rather try to ﬁnd out what par-
ticular circle of monopoly capital is supporting and encouraging
Long to build up a fascist movement in this country? Here
Walter Lippmann insinuated that some of the Republicans are
secretly playing with Long, having this in view: that Long would
split the Democratic Party and thus enable a Republican President
to get into ofiice at the next national election. And the “choco-
late soldier”, Johnson, reported even more plainly that——

“I have a letter reciting a recent gleeful dinner of six such
Senators who were happy over their own assertion: ‘The next
election is in the bag—al1 we have to do is to sit back and laugh
——Huey Long and Father Coughlin are going to give it to us’.”
(New York Times, March 5, 1935.)

Who are the Senators and what are their connections with some

of the more fascist-inclined monopolies? Let Johnson speak out

a bit more plainly.
One thing is certain. The monopolies are already preparing
, 14

I fascist breastworks against the inevitable explosion of the accu-

mulating mass discontent and disappointment with Roosevelt and
his treacherous New Deal. The monopolies see the initial growth
of a mass Labor Party and of increasing Communist inﬂuence
which strengthen the backbone of the workers’ and farmers’ re-
sistance to the capitalist offensive. What better way, think the
monopolies, is there of bolstering up the capitalist offensive upon
the masses and of confusing their radicalization than the way of
building up fascist movements in this country and of utilizing for
this purpose such wild demagogues as Huey Long and Father
Coughlin? W
But let us examine the Long demagogy still from another angle.

Concentrated Wealth Is Concentrated Capital

Long and Coughlin both speak against “concentrated wealth”.
They say they want to see wealth de-concentrated, redistributed.
But what is the bulk of concentrated wealth under the present
system? It is concentrated capital, concentrated means of produc-
tion used by those who control them—the capitalists—-—to exploit
the workers and toiling masses generally.

We’ll take Long’s own example to illustrate the idea. He says
the Ford Motor Company is worth two billion dollars. To share
the wealth, he would take from Ford $1,996,000,000 for the
United States Treasury, leaving Ford the remainder-—four million
dollars. Very well. But this sum of one billion, nine hundred
and ninety-six million dollars represents the value of what?’
Largely of land, buildings, machinery, tools, raw materials, etc.
~—that is, of means of production which under capitalism is
capital.

Long does not propose to break up and divide these means
of production. He only proposes to divide up the shares and
stocks which represent claims to these means of production. And
we have already shown how such a proposal is either a reaction-
ary scheme or it must lead to the socialist revolution. Here we
are concerned with something else. We want to ﬁnd out why
capital concentrates. We want to ﬁnd out how it is that, as we go

along, bi ver fortunes become still bi" er, the small fellow is-
:5 go Dg

being squeezed out, and the number of propertyless is becoming
larger and larger.

     
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    

The question which we" seek to answer is: Will Long’: “share-
the-.weal‘th” plan stop and do away with this process of concen-
tration of wealth? *

Suppose for a moment that the capitalists of this country
would accept meekly and without resistance Long’s capital levy.

Then after a while fortunes would become a bit leveled out. Ford ’

would own four million dollars instead of two billion. Rocke-
feller would own also four million instead of ten billion, and so
forth, while a large number who now own nothing or less than
ﬁve thousand would each be owning ﬁve thousand dollars. Then
what happens? .

‘ Production continues to be capitalist. That means, ﬁrst, pro-
duction for proﬁt. Accumulation of private proﬁts continues.
Second, since the big corporations remain intact, they continue to
enjoy allthe advantages of capital accumulation that are offered
by large-scale’ industry. These corporations, that according -to
Long’s plan remain in possession of the concentrated means of
production, distribution and ﬁnance, continue not only to exploit

the wage workers but also to rob and oppress the toiling farmers,

and the small capitalist. The result is that capitalist relations
are reproduced again and concentration of capital is reproduced.
Big fortunes will again grow bigger, the small fellow will grow
smaller and squeezed out altogether and the number of property-
less will again begin to increase. Thus after a while "we will ﬁnd
ourselves in the same (“if not worse) condition of concentrated
wealth as we were when we started out with the capital levy.
What will Long do then? Another capital levy to even out
fortunes once more. But we have already shown what happens
to it when you try the ﬁrst time. So there is no need repeating.
The argument here goes to show that concentration of wealth,
of capital, is a law of capitalist development. And as long as
capitalism prevails, this is how it develops. Especially is this true

, of the present stage of capitalism, the last stage, when it is fully

ripe and ready to be overthrown, the stage of imperialism.

Long says he wants to do away with concentration of wealth
without doing away with capitalism. This is humbug. This is
fascist demagogy. As long as you have capitalist production, you
inevitably have capitalist reproduction. This means the reproduc-
tion of capital and of concentrated capital; this means, on the

16

.jo-

.2-

other hand, the reproduction of poverty and propertylessness.
An‘ examination of Long’s schemes of leveling up incomes will
show his fascist humbug even more clearly.

To Regulate Earnings--Capitalist Way or Socialist Way?

After he had carried through the “share-the-wealth” plan,
Long says he would begin totackle the regulation of earnings,
incomes. And in this way: ‘

It

. a minimum earning would be established for any person
with a family to support. It would be such a living on which one
already owning a home could maintain a family in comfort of
not less than around $2,500 a year to every family.” (New York
T imes, March 8, 1935.)

Long has not said yet how he was going to establish such a
minimum, and how he was going to enforce it. So we must try
to ﬁgure it out for ourselves. And the ﬁrst thing we must doais
to examine Long’s proposition with respect to the various kinds
of earnings under the present capitalist system. Otherwise we
get nowhere.

What kinds of earnings are there? The worker gets wages.
The capitalist gets proﬁts. These are the two main kinds of earn-
ings in ‘present-day capitalist society, corresponding to the two
chief classes under capitalism. Then there are the kinds of earn-
ings of the intermediary social groups and classes: toiling farm-
ers of various sorts (farmer-owners, small tenants, share-croppers,
etc.); artisans, small shopkeepers, salaried workers, etc.

Wages. Long’s promise is that he would see to it that every
wage-worker who has a family to support would receive a wage
big enough to enable him to “maintain a family in comfort”. We
assume that Long would promulgate a law compelling all em-
ployers of labor to pay an appropriate wage. Today the minimum
may be $2,500 a year. And, if the cost of living should continue
to rise, the law would have to raise wages accordingly. Thus far
the thing is reasonably clear.

_ But from here on several diﬁculties arise with Long’s plan.

Suppose the capitalists, the employers of labor, either part
of them or all, refuse to pay this minimum wage. This is not a
far-fetched assumption. We have seen such things happen before;
and we see it happening right now. Roosevelt says his government

had promulgated .a law compelling the employers to recognize
17

collective bargaining but the employers laugh at it. Could any-
thing be done about it? Yes, a good deal. The workers, organ-
ized in fighting unions, could strike to enforce the minimum wage,
and with the support of the government, the workers would surely
win. No doubt about that. But Long is opposed to strikes, and
he is opposed to ﬁghting unions and to the idea of class struggle.
That’s why he is opposed to Communism. So we see that this
way of enforcing the minimum wage, which he himself promul-
gated, he will not take. What other ways would be open to him?

He could promulgate another law which would tax the profits
of the recalcitrant employers and out of the proceeds of this tax
make good to the workers the difference between the minimum
wage and that actually paid. That wouldn’t be such a bad way
either; for a while, at any rate. But then he would be embarking
upon drastic taxation again and he would meet a similar kind of
situation as the one dealt with in the case of the capital levy.
That is, systematic sabotage by the capitalists which can be
broken only by the socialist revolution to which Long, by his
own admission, is mortally opposed. So we see that this road of
enforcing the minimum wage, Long wouldn’t take either. Are
there any other ways open?

Yes. He could conﬁscate outright every plant of a recalci-
trant employer, establish there real workers’ control of produc-
tion, and run it as a government business. But this would arouse
the ire of the capitalists still more and a struggle would ensue
which could be solved in the interests of the masses only by the
socialist revolution. But this is taboo for Long.

So what else could he do? Surrender to the capitalists. This
is what he did in Louisiana when he came in conﬂict with the
Standard Oil on the question of taxation. When the Standard Oil
raised a howl, and threatened civil war, he surrendered." Why
should we think that he will do better when in control of the
federal government? ‘ i

All that we said thus far on the minimum wage of $2,500 a
year does notmean that only the socialist revolution can bring

a this about. To say so would be absolutely false. The Communist

Party calls ‘for higher Wages and shorter hours, right now. It

incessantly works to help organize the workers to fight for such
demands. That is why the Communist workers in the trade unions
ﬁght for militant policies against the capitalists. But this is not
Long’s plan; it is the Communist Party plan. It is a plan which
calls for the building up of powerful ﬁghting industrial unions
in all industries, for the building up of an anti-capitalist mass
Labor Party built on the unions, for the strengthening of the
Communist Party itself as a strong mass Party, andlfor a united
front of the masses in the daily organized struggle (strikes, mass
meetings, demonstrations, etc.) to ﬁght for higher wages, shorter

‘ hours, and other betterments of the conditions of labor. In this

way, says the Communist Party, the workers can also force Con-
gress to pass laws favorable to the workers and by their own
struggles enforce the application of such laws.

Up till now we have discussed Long’s plan to insure minimum
earnings without considering the question of crises and unem-
ployment. Manifestly, this question cannot be ignored. it

Suppose for a moment that the employers of labor would
willingly agree to pay their workers such a minimum wage as
would enable a family to live “in comfort”. Hard as it is to
assume such an impossibility, seeing how the employers behave
right now in such industries as steel, mining, textile, automobiles,
etc., we will for a moment make such a supposition. Having done
so, we ask: and who will pay the unemployed? There are today
in the United States not less than about 12 million fully unem-
pl\oyed "workers according to the conservative ﬁgures of the
American Federation of Labor. The true ﬁgure is somewhere
around 17 million. Will Long get them jobs for a wage to live
in comfort with their families? And if not, will he provide for
their being paid by the government the same minimum as the
employed workers?

He may say: yes. He will say anything that suits his purposes.

- But from what we know already about his plan, we cannot take

his word for it. We want to know, at least, how he proposes to
do it. From his plan, as made known so far, we will show that
he won’t do it. .

First of all, is it possible to get jobs for all the unemployed

‘ that are able to work? Surely it is. The Communist Party pro- \

gram points the way and shows how.

“Such a government would immediately provide an endless flow
of commodities to replace the stores thus used by opening all fac-
tories, mills and mines, and giving every person a job at constantly
increasing wages.” (Manifesto of the Eighth Convention of the
Communist Party of the U.S.A.)

That is clear. After the revolutionary overthrow of the exist-
ing capitalist government, of which Huey Long is a part, and the
establishment of a Workers’ and Farmers’ Soviet government——

such a government would immediately expropriate all large-scale ,

industry, commerce, transportation and banking-. Having all this
in its hands, the Soviet government would begin to run them at
full capacity. It would cut down the work-day to whatever point
might be necessary to insure a job and decent wages to all

workers. And,

“With the establishment of a socialist system in America, there
will be such a Hood of wealth available for the country as can
hardly be imagined.” (Manifesto of the Communist Party.)

This is the solution of the problem. The revolutionary,solu-
tion. The only possible solution. But Huey Long wages war
against this solution. And what is his alternative? He has none
except empty promises. He says he will cut the hours of labor
to thirty hours per week or less, and the work-year to eleven
months or less. That isvall right. That is what the Communist
Party demands. But the Communist Party also says: cut in hours
without cut in weekly wages, cut in hours with increases in weekly
wages, because present wages are insuﬂicient for a decent liveli-
hood. How to get this under capitalism? By organizing and by
ﬁghting, by waging a class struggle against the capitalists-—~says
the Communist Party program.

But even with reduced hours, without a decrease in wages,
capitalist industry today could not absorb more than a fraction
of r the 17 million now unemployed. Furthermore, even the capi-
talist experts admit that only a fraction of the present army of

’ unemployed would be absorbed into industry assuming a return

of the 1929 boom. But nobody envisages such a return under

capitalism. At any rate, there are no signs whatever of its

approach even remotely.

Can anything be done now, before the socialist revolution, to '

help these millions of unemployed? Surely. It is unemployment
20

relief and insurance, to be paid for by the capitalists. It is the
Workers’ Old Age, Unemployment and Social Insurance Bill——
HR. 2827-now before Congress, which was initiated and framed
by the Communist Party and is supported by large masses of work-
ers, toiling farmers and toilers generally. Will Congress adopt
this bill? If Huey Long and his friends in Congress have their
way, it will most probably not be adopted. But if the masses, led
by the Communist Party, will wage a militant ﬁght for it, chances
are that Congress can be compelled to make this bill a law.

But what has Long on that? Nothing. Worse than nothing.
He is against this program of the Communist Party; he is against
the methods of class struggle advocated by the Communists, He
stands with the capitalists and against the workers and toiling
farmers. '

We will now make one more supposition. We will suppose
that the capitalists will pay willingly, without the workers ﬁghting
for it, Long's minimum wage to all———employed and unemployed.
This immediately raises a very big question. The question of
national planning. For it is evident that with the present system
of anarchy in production, with each capitalist or corporation
making and ﬁghting for its own plans as against all the others,
American industry couldn’t reabsorb the present army of unem-
ployed. You would have to get all the capitalists to unite har-
moniously in order to decide how much each should produce,
how many workers should be allocated to each plant, what should
be the wages, proﬁts, prices, quotas on the market, etc. In other
words, you would have to begin the organization of planned
economy. .

Is that possible? Surely. They have established planned econ-
omy in the Soviet Union and it works ﬁne. But there it is not

the capitalists, or a capitalist government, that does the planning.’

It is the workers and farmers with their own government. This
has become possible in the Soviet Union, which is the only coun-
try in the world that has a planned economy, because there was
there a socialist revolution, organized and led by the Communist
Party———the party of Lenin and Stalin. But this is not what Huey
Long is talking about. This is what the Communist Party of the
United States is talking and ﬁghting about.

Huey Long, to begin with, promises you the realization of all

21

his plans without governmental planning and organization.
Second, he promises you all these things without a socialist revo-I
lution and without the setting up of a workers’ and farmers’
government. This means that Huey Long is against a planned
economy. Hence what must be the conclusion?

The conclusion must be that Huey Long is trying to sell to
the American masses a discredited fascist humbug.

We shall prove this even more conclusively when we take up
his plan for the farmers and Negroes.

Long's Promises to the Farmers and Negroes’

‘We are continuing the discussion of that part of Long’s plan
which promises a minimum income of $2,500 a year to all who
do not make it now. Previously we have discussed what this would
mean to wages. Here we shall examine the plan as it affects the
farmers and Negroes.

How would Long regulate the income of the farmers in accord
with his plan?

Unlike the worker, the farmer’s income is not made up of
wages paid by the employer of his labor power. If you take the
farmer-capitalist‘, his income is made up of proﬁt (including rent,
interest, etc.) derived from the exploitation of the labor he
employs. With him we are not concerned here. But we are con-
cerned with the income of the toiling farmer. Most of the farmers
in this category, as a rule, employ little labor or none. They
exploit their own selves and their families. They derive their
incomes not by directly selling their labor power to an employer
(as a wage worker) but by selling the product of their labor:
wheat, corn, hogs, vegetables, etc. -.

To regulate the income of the wage (or salaried) workers
under capitalism, you have got to control directly the payroll of
the employer. But to regulate the income of the toiling farmer
under capitalism, you have to regulate the market. For it is the

market price of the commodities that he sells (and the means of ’

production that he buys) that determines in the ﬁrst instance the
income of the toiling farmer who has produce to sell. This is
not, of course, the only thing. Taxation, interest rates on the
capital that the farmer must borrow, mortgage payments and
22

 

debts generally——all these have a most decisive inﬂuence upon
the income of the toiling farmer.

That is why the Communist Party ﬁghts for such partial
demands as abolition of taxation upon toiling farmers, cancella-
tion of their mortgages and all other debts to the government and
the bankers, etc. It ﬁghts for these partial demands as a measure
of immediate alleviation of the plight of the toiling farmers. It
ﬁghts in addition for immediate government relief for the farmers
and for their social insurance under the Workers’ Unemployment,
Old Age and Social Insurance Bill———H.R. 2827. These measures
would really alleviate, though temporarily, the sufferings of the
toiling farmer. But it is the Communist Party that ﬁghts for
these measures. These are not in Huey Long’s plan.

Now to come back to market and prices. Can the farmer’s
prices be regulated in his favor so as to insure him a certain mini-
mum income? Surely they can. Let us see how.

First, he has to be made the real owner of his produce. This
means freeing the toiling farmer from all indebtedness so he can
sell whenever he ﬁnds it advantageous and not when dictated to
by his creditors. Also he must have government elevators and
warehouses to keep his produce until sold.

Second, all speculation in agricultural products must be at
once abolished and with it must go all grain exchanges. Specu-
lation in agricultural products must be made a felony to be
heavily punished. .

Third, a government monopoly in all foreign trade in agri-
cultural products must be established. The reason is clear: to
protect home prices from the influence of the changes in world
prices since prices of American agricultural products are deter-
mined now by the world market.

Fourth, the government must begin to accumulate reserves
of imperishable agricultural goods so as to be able to release
to the market (or when necessary to withdraw from it) such
quantities of commodities as may be necessary either to raise or
to lower prices. Such reserves the government can easily acquire
by conﬁscating the reserves held by speculators and banks, and
by buying the rest from the toiling farmers, at ﬁxed prices.

Fifth, a wide network of farmers’ cooperatives would have to
be developed for joint selling and buying. These cooperatives

23

' to be controlled by the toiling farmers and not by the government,

bureaucracy or the rich capitalist farmers and bankers.

After these measures have been put into effect, then we can
begin to tackle in earnest the regulation of farmers’ prices in
favor of the toiling farmer and of the working class. But not
before. These measures are the very minimum necessary to give
the government—a government that can be entrusted with such a
job—the power to actually ﬁx and maintain such prices as will
beneﬁt the toiling masses.

Compare this program, which is a Communist program, with
the methods of the Roosevelt A.A.A. The A.A.A. also is trying
to regulate prices of agricultural products but it is trying to do
it in the interests of the speculators, the banks and rich farmers.
And at whose expense? At the expense of the mass of toiling
farmers and of the working class'and poor population of the
cities. By destroying crops and limiting agricultural production
generally, the A.A.A. did succeed in raising prices of agricultural
commodities. But what good is it to the small’ farmers? They
have higher prices but less to sell so that they are about even, if
not worse off. But that is not all. The A.A.A. is part of the whole
New Deal. And the other “accomplishments” of the New Deal
are: an inﬂated dollar and proportionately larger increases in
the prices. of the industrial commodities which the farmer buys.

Thus, while the price per quantity of goods paid to the farmer.

is now higher, the actual income (not the nominal) is smaller.

There are all kinds of price regulations possible. Those in
the interests of the exploiters and those in the interests of the
exploited. We are concerned with the latter kind whereas the
A.A.A. is practicing the ﬁrst kind. But the latter kind of regula-
tion can be seriously started only after the above measures have
been realized. Will Long realize these measures?: Of course not.
They are measures for which the Communists stand-~and Long
is waging war against Communism. 1

Thus, these ﬁve measures do not yet mean socialism. But they
are steps in the direction of socialism. At any rate, no government
can undertake to tackle, let alone solve, this question of good
prices for the toiling farmers without first putting into effect

these measures. And yet Long does not even touch the question.
24-

He just talks of farmers’ income in general; exactly like Hitler
did before he came to power. a .

From the above it is clear that only a Soviet government, led
by Communists, will put such measures into effect. Why? Be-
cause such measures constitute a serious break with the existing
capitalist relations, leading to new socialist relations. It should
also be clear that only fakers and fascist ldeceivers will promise
a comfortable income, and stable income, to the toiling farmers
without at least’ tackling price ﬁxing in the manner above

described.
Farmers With Nothing to Sell

We also have such farmers, large numbers of them: farmers
with nothing to sell. How is Huey Long going to insure incomes
and ﬁx prices for them? Among such farmers we ﬁnd farmer
owners with insufiicient land or implements, small tenant farmers,
and share-croppers. Among the latter, large numbers of Negroes.
What is their problem of securing a $2,500-a-year income?

It is the problem of more or better land, implements, seeds;
and, for the tenants and share-croppers, liberation from the
oppression of the landlord. Land for them, first of all. Strangely
enough (or maybe it is not strange), the boss of Louisiana, which
has a real share-croppers’ problem, ﬁnds not a word to say about

this category of farmers, although he talks a good deal about

farmers. For example:

“We would plow up no crops. . . . We would raise all the cotton
we needed, and if we raised more, we would store the surplus in
the government warehouses for the next year. If we got to where
we had more than twelve months’ supply of any crop, then we
wouldn’t raise any crop the next year, and that would he the year
we would put on the government and state public works in that
territory.” (New York Times, March 8, 1935.)

That does not help much the share-cropper, or the landless

ifarmer generally. Nor does it help the farmer owner who can’t

raise on his poor land a crop suﬂicient to maintain himself and

his family. However, it sounds good to the farmer who owns\

enough and the right kind of land to make a living when all these

things that Long promises will be realized. But there is a catch

to it. It is, namely, that Long is opposed to all those measures
2

 

(the ﬁve measures discussed above) without which these promises‘;

arevsheer deception.
1 Just think of it: Can you have all that we just quoted from

- L/ong while the toiling farmer is burdened with debts and at the
»mercy of his capitalist creditors? Can you have it while the

speculators and banks dominate the markets for agricultural
produce, and the fluctuations of the world market dominate
American prices, and prices are not ﬁxed and maintained by a
workers’ and farmers’ government, and farmers’ cooperatives

are either insufficiently‘ developed (as today) or controlled for s

the most part by agents of the rich farmers and speculators?
And think of that also: If you are to have what Long promises,

you must have someone to plan production. Not only agricultural,

but also industrial. And planned in such a way as will benefit

the toiling farmers, and the working class, and the poor popula- «

tion of the cities. Because otherwise you will have another A.A.A.
or even worse. You may get the sort of regulation that Hitler

\ fascism established in Germany, that is, slavery in addition to

hunger.
What must you have then to realize the desires of the masses

for an economy of plenty with which Huey Long, in true fascist’

style, is brazenly playing? You must have a Workers’ and Farm-
ers’ Government which you can get only by revolutionary struggle
and in no other way. Only such a revolutionary government,

“. . would secure to the farmers the possession of their land
and provide them with the necessary means for a comfortable
living; it would make possible for the farming population to unite
their forces in a cooperative socialist agriculture, and thus bring
to the farming population all the advantages of modern civilization,
and would multiply manifold the productive capacities of American
agriculture.” (Manifesto of the Eighth Convention of the Com-
munist Party of the U.S.A.)

Long and the Negroes

Long is playing also with the sufferings and needs of the
Negroes.,He quotes a letter from a Negro in Louisiana:

. “Here is a letter from a poor nigger down in our country.
They are no worse off there than anywhere else. . . . I can’t help
him all that I would like to, but I will help every one of these
white and colored people to some extent in my state.” (New York
Times, March 8, 1935.)

Note the true Southern slavedriver style: _“poor nigger”. L But V

we will pass that by, for the minute. Note also the brazen and
detestable lie that the Negroes in the South and in Louisiana,
“are no worse 017 there than anywhere else”. Especially note the
hypocritical remark that he “can’t help him all that I would like
to”. How much would he like to? Tell us, Mr. Long, and the
Negro masses in Louisiana will tell ybu what you could do.

You could abolish the share-cropping system by giving each
share-cropper enough land and implements to cultivate it. The
land you could get by expropriating the large estates_ and land-
holders, among them corporations, banks, etc. And the funds for
implements, seeds, etc., you could get through taxation of the
rich. You are talking so much about taxation.

You could abolish all taxation upon the toiling farmers, and
upon the Negro farmers to begin with, and cancel all their debts

‘to government and capitalists.

You could abolish the brutal and disgraceful system of jim-
crowism and insure full and complete rights to the Negro people.

This would be good as a beginning. Then you could follow
it up with the rest of the Communist program which says:

“Such a revolutionary government . . . would proceed at once
to the complete liberation of the Negro people from all oppres-
sion, secure the right of self-determination of the Black Belt, and
would secure unconditional economic, political and social equality.”
(Manifesto of the Eighth Convention of the Communist Party of
the USA.)

Is Long the one to do it? No, not Long, nor any other fascist
faker. It is the Soviet government of the United States that will
do it. And to get such a government, we must ﬁght precisely
against such fakers as Long, and similar deceivers of the people.
We must ﬁght in accordance with the policies of the Communist

' Party.

Taxation. Credit and the Transfer of Wealth

Huey Long has made no new discoveries. He himself desig-

nates the Bible, the Pilgrim Fathers, and the philosophers of \

ancient Greece as the originators of his scheme for “share-the-

wealth”. It is admittedly an old yearning and desire of the poor

and exploited from the time that society broke up into classes of
27 ‘

 

\

exploiters and exploited. Long merely picked up this old desire V

of the exploited and isplaying with it for fascist purposes.

As human society was passing from one stage of develop-
ment to another, this desire of the masses for sharing the wealth
assumed different forms. And until capitalism arrived this desire
was only a dream and was bound to remain so. Why? Because
true sharing of the wealth meant Communism; and Communism,
the highest form of socialism, could arise only at a certain stage
in the development of the productive forces of society.

The productive forces of society, that is, the ability of society
to produce wealth, had to reach such a stage where it would be
possible, by abolishing exploitation, to satisfy everybody’s needs.
That was the first condition. The second was that division of
social labor should reach such a height and the productive forces
should reach a certain degree of concentration; that is, produc-
tion should become social in character to such a degree as would
make it possible to socialize the means of production. And the
third condition was that there should arise an exploited class in
society that would possess two main characteristics: (a) that its
own liberation would be possible only by the abolition of all

i exploitation and the abolition of class divisions altogether; and
H (b) that it should play a decisive role in the national economy

and that it should be able to take over and develop further the
productive forces on a socialist basis. »

These conditions for socialism, which alone lays the basis
for the realization of the old dream of sharing the wealth—these
conditions were created under capitalism. That’s why scientiﬁc
Communism—-Marxism-Leninism—arose under capitalism. It
douldn’t arise before. But when it did arise, it transformed the
old dream into a science—scientiﬁc Communism. That is what
they are building with in the Soviet Union. That is what the
Communist Party of America is ﬁghting for. _

Huey Long is afraid to touch the science. He prefers, instead,
to play with the dream. That’s what Hitler did in the interests
of the German monopolies. ~

The Small Man's Dreams

It “is among the '“small men” especially, among those whom

scientiﬁc Communism designates as the petty bourgeoisie, that
28 .

—»--..,ua~v.\- -«‘=~>._~_..*:~.~... . ..

some new forms of the old dream ﬁnd their main lodging. The
working class, particularly the modern industrial proletariat, is
less subject to the inﬂuences of such dreams. Being the only
consistent revolutionary class because its own liberation demands
the abolition of all forms of exploitation of man by man, the
working class is inevitably and most easily led to the recognition
that scientiﬁc Communism is its own philosophy and theory. In
addition, the decisive position of the working class in the national
economy and its powers of organization make it the natural leader
of the struggle for the realization of the old dream along the
lines of scientiﬁc Communism.

What is the main feature of these dreams of the “small man”?
It is the wish to abolish extreme wealth, on the one hand, and
extreme poverty, on the other, without abolishing class exploita-
tion, without abolishing capitalism. That is a dream. Old Theo-
dore Roosevelt—a Republican——played with this dream when
he assured the masses that he would stop the concentration of
wealth, bust the trusts, without busting capitalism from which
this concentration arises. And what was the result? Today we
have more concentration of wealth and more poverty. The trusts
have never had more power in the country than they have today.

Franklin D. Roosevelt——-a Democrat—is also playing with this
dream. He announced his N.R.A., with the help of Long and
others, as a means of curbing the trusts, stopping the concentra-
tion of wealth and redistributing the wealth by leveling it out.
The result is well known. More millionaires and more paupers.
Unheard of power by the trusts and brutal crushing of the “small
man”. You remember the Darrow Report.

Now Huey Long and the radio priest are making similar
promises. Long says he will level out the wealth of the country
by a capital levy; and the radio priest says he will accomplish
the same job by restoring to Congress “its right and duty to coin
and regulate the value of money”. (New York Times, March 12,
1935.)

Measure Transitional to Socialism

Can the government’s power of taxation, and its power to
coin and regulate money, and the proposed power to control and
regulate credit-—can these powers be used to transfer the wealth

HOW CAN WE SHARE THE WEALTH?
By ALEX BITTELMAN

The Long-Coughlin-Johnson "Controversy"

IN the early part of March, 1935, the political temperature of
this country registered a sudden rise. A heated “controversy”
broke out among three prominent people. On one side of this
peculiar debate stood General Hugh Johnson of Wall Street, who
is described by his opponents as “a chocolate soldier”; and on
the other stood “share-the-wealth Long” and “social-justice
Coughlin” who are described by Johnson as the “two pied pipers”.

A great controversy!

What was this controversy all about? According to General
Johnson of Wall Street, the “two pied pipers” are supposed to be
dangerous revolutionists; and, believe it or not, the radio priest,
Coughlin, would appear to be the head of a “national revolu-
tionary party”. This is nothing less than sensational. True,
Johnson also suggested that these two “dangerous revolutionists”
were in some way supported and encouraged by certain reaction-

ary circles in the Republican Party. And, if this is so, the whole

Johnsonian argument fails to make sense. Because, who has
ever heard of the Republican Party, not only the reactionaries but
also the progressives, encouraging and supporting revolutionists?
They don’t support or encourage the Communist Party, do they?
But we will let that stand for the moment.

Now, if we turn to the “two pied pipers”, the controversy
would seem to have been caused by the bankruptcy of the N.R.A.
According to Long, it was he "who was chosen by Roosevelt as the
scapegoat to cover up the dismal failure of the N.R.A. It tran-
spires, if we take Long’s word for it, that it was he who tried to
hold Roosevelt down to his promises to redistribute the wealth
of the country; it was he who had warned Roosevelt that the
N.R.A. would be a failure if these promises were not fulﬁlled.
And, now that these forewarnings have come true, Roosevelt is

. trying to avenge himself upon the fellow who has made them.

‘So, if we believe Long, it all comes down to his scheme for
3

\

/ w
from the rich to the poor, from the exploiters to the explolted?

Our answer was what?
Yes, these powers can be used for that purpose. It depends,

 

however, on the conditions under which it is done and by what

kind of a government it is done.

First about the conditions.

If it is done in the process of the socialist revolution, as ﬁrst
steps towards the socialization of industry, then these powers of
government to tax, and to regulate currency and credit, can be

 

used very effectively to alleviate the suffering of the masses at ‘

once and, at the same time, to accelerate the process of trans-
ferring the wealth of the nation from the capitalists to the toilers.

In other words, these powers of government can be used v ry
effectively in the interests of the workers, toiling farmers and all
exploited, only in the carrying out of measures transitional to

A socialism.

We have shown in the foregoing articles how a capital levy,
such as Long is playing around with, would be (or might be) a
powerful auxiliary instrument for hastening the transference of

the wealth of the country to the exploited. We have shown how i

inevitably the carrying out earnestly of a capital levy, if it is‘to
be made effective, would lead to certain measures of socializa-
tion, would open up the transition to socialism and the ﬁght for
the establishment of a Soviet government of workers and farmers.
but by itself, just the promulgation of a capital levy by the gov-
ernment and nothing else, the capital levy would become a joke.
It would never become effective. And it certainly would not
achieve any signiﬁcant or tangible redistribution of wealth.

What is the theoretical, the scientiﬁc explanation for that?

It is this: that the basic reason for concentrated wealth, and
the tremendous disproportions between wealth; and poverty, is
the capitalist relations of production. It is in the sphere of pro-
duction, not credit, not money, not taxation, that the basic cause
lies for the existing inequalities in the distribution of wealth. It
is the capitalist ownership of the means of production. Take this
away from them and make it socialist property, and you have
removed the roots of capitalism and of concentrated private
wealth. To accomplish this job, or in transition to it, taxation and
regulation of money and credit will be very helpful. Leave the

means of production with the capitalists, and no matter what you -

30

 

do by taxation, money and credit, you will not abolish concen'-

f trated wealth and poverty.

Taxation, and the regulation of money and credit, have a
powerful effect upon production. The capitalist governments use
such of these powers as they enjoy to protect and defend the
interests of the capitalist production. And the power of regu-
lating currency and credit, which is now in the hands of the
banking oligarchy in the United States, is a powerful weapon
in their hands to protect the interests of the monopolies. But

' why are these instruments such a powerful weapon in the hands

of the banking oligarchy? Because these instruments (regulation
of money and credit) are derived from and serve a certain mode
of production, the capitalist mode of production. i

What is the conclusion? If you want to use such instruments
efiectively for the exploited and against the capitalists, you must
use them for the purpose of building up another mode of produc-
tion, the socialist mode of production.

Now about the kind of government that can do it. I

It stands to reason that if these instruments (taxation, regu-
lation of currency and credit) can be used to accelerate the
transference of wealth from the capitalists to the masses in an

eﬂective way only as measures transitional to the building of a.

socialist mode of production, or in the actual building of it, then
the kind of government that will do it is the one that sets out
to build socialism. That means a Soviet government of workers
and farmers.

It is conceivable, of course, that some of these measures can
be imposed upon a non-Soviet government by a powerful revo-
lutionary upsurge of the masses. But that would mean the eve
of the struggle for power which would soon sweep out that gov-
ernment and establish the workers and farmers in power._

That is the meaning of Marx’s words:

“That under certain economic and political conditions the credit
system can serve to hasten the emancipation of the working class,
just as, for instance, in the beginning of the eighteenth and again
at the beginning of the nineteenth century in England it served
towards transferring the wealth of one class to another, is quite
unquestionable, self-evident. But to regard interest-bearing wpital
as the main form of capital while trying to use a special form of
credit, the alleged abolition of interest, as the basis for a trans-

31 .

formation of society, is ‘a thoroughly lpetlty-bourgeois fantasy.”
(T he Correspondence, of Marx and Engels, Letter No. 72, Inter- T
national Publishers, New York.) ‘

'l11is_fantasy Marx had to deal with as far back as in the 1860’s
to combat the ideologist of the French petty bourgeoisie,
Proudhon. But it still holds good for understanding the fantastic
nature of similar schemes today. And it helps to detect the fascist
nature of the “ideology” of such fellows as Long and Coughlin,
who play upon these fantasies of the petty bourgeoisie to build
up for the monopolies fascist bulwarks against the toilers and
for the capitalist offensive.

the redistribution of wealth, to his plan of “share-the-wealth”.3 I. '
It is onrintention, in this series of articles, to examine this plan *
objectively and thoroughly. Any plan for the abolition of pov-

erty, which claims to have discovered a way of achieving this
objective of the Communist Party without resort to the working-

class revolution and socialism, is a challenge to us—--a challenge

which we must seriously examine and answer.

Huey Long claims to have discovered such a way. He claims
to have gotten hold of a plan “for guaranteeing comfort and con-
venience to all humanity out of this abundance in our country”
(New York Times, March 8, 1935), without the need of ﬁghting M
for it, without overthrowing the political power of the capitalists
and establishing the political power of the workers and toiling
farmers, without expropriating the means of production owned
now by the monopolies, and without building a socialist economy
as the ﬁrst phase of Communism.

In other words, Long promises to accomplish the chief objec-
tive of the Communist Party—the abolition of poverty and a
decent liming for all toilers—without adopting the Communist
road to this objective. More than that, he promises to accomplish
this Communist objective by means of struggle against the Com-
munist Party. That is strange, isn’t it? And it is also a bit
reminiscent of Hitler’s promises in Germany. But we will not
press this point now. At present we wish only to establish beyond
controversy Long’s true position with respect to socialization of
industry and Communism.

On the ﬁrst question, he is reported to have said that:

“. . . he did not plan the complete socialization of industry.

Even in the case where he would have the government conﬁscate

virtually two-thirds of a person’s holdings in his own business,

he would leave all the voting stock in the hands of the industrial-
ist.” (New York Times, March 9, 1935.) 3 C

And on the question of Communism, he said:

“Communism? Communism? Hell, no. This plan is the only
defense this country’s got against communism and it’s got to be put
in force within the next ﬁve years or communism will be upon us.”

(Ibid.) '
What Price Promises?

One need not necessarily be a Communist in order to have
4

 

one’s suspicions aroused by any fellow who sets out to accomplish
the main aim of Communism by declaring war against the party
of Communism. Such a fellow needs to be investigated by com-
paring his words with his deeds, his promises with his accom-
plishments. Because—what price promises? We have had them
aplenty; and we all know the results. Didn’t Hoover promise us
a “chicken in every pot” and “an automobile in every garage”?
And what happened to it? On this question we can call upon
Wall Street J ohnson—the Democrat—to give objective evidence,
since the above promise was made by a Republican President.

And Johnson says: the promise of Hoover “turned out to be two‘

chickens in every garage”. (New York Times, March 5, 1935.)

Why should we believe Long more than Hoover?

Roosevelt, too, has made some tall promises: especially Roose-
velt, we should say. And what happened to that? Let Huey
Long tell the story.

“So we convinced Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt that it was
necessary that he announce and promise to the American people
that in the event he were elected President of the United States
he would pull down the size of the big man’s fortune and guarantee
something to every family, enough to do away with all poverty, and
to give employment to those who were able to work and an edu-
cation to the children born into the world.” (New York Times,
March 8, 1935.)

So we have it on the authority of Long himself that Roosevelt
was convinced by “we”, meaning Long and his friends, to promise
the American people “to do away with all poverty”. Long, on
his own admission, was a partner to the scheme. Then what hap-
pened? Says Long:

“Mr. Roosevelt made those promises. He made them before he
was nominated in the Chicago convention, he made them again
before he was elected in November, and he went so far as to
remake those promises a day or two after he was inaugurated Presi-
dent of the United States, and I was one authorized to say so, and

I thought for a day or two after he took the oath as President that
maybe hewas going through with his promises.” (Ibid.)

Again we have it on Long’s own admission that (1) he was
very uncertain of Roosevelt’s sincerity; that (2) he only thought
that “maybe” Roosevelt will go through with his promises; and
that (3) he thought so only “for a day or two”. Clearly,.—Long

had all the reasons in the world to come out before the elections

' and make it clear to the people that, as far as these promises were

concerned, Roosevelt could not be depended upon. But no, Long

did the exact opposite: he accepted Roosevelt’s authorization to

assure the American people that Roosevelt was OK.
Then what happened? Says Long:

“But no heart has ever been so saddened, no person’s ambition
was ever so blighted as was mine when I came to the realization
that the President of the United States was not going to undertake
what he said he would do.” (Ibid.)

We have no means of entering Mr. Long’s heart to see how
much “saddened” it was at the realization that Roosevelt was

breaking his promises. But what we can do is to draw certain \‘

provisional conclusions regarding the value of promises of this
type. Mr. Roosevelt, together with Mr. Long, have promised to
do away with poverty. This promise was shamelessly violated
by Roosevelt, so says Long; and he is right on that. But where
is" the assurance that Long would not do the same?

Just think of this: i

Long is the boss of Louisiana. He himself boasts of having
in his vest pocket the government of that state. Surely, he
couldn’t have more power in the whole United States, if he were
President, than he has now in Louisiana. And what has he done
with that power to alleviate the suffering of the masses in his state?

How many homes has he. given to the toiling farmers, the
workers, and the Negroes in Louisiana? How many children of
these toilers h.as Long placed in colleges? ‘ To how many unem-
ployed workers and starving farmers has he made available

decent and suﬁicient relief? Has he adopted any effective laws ,

for unemployment and social insurance? Has he adopted any
laws to shorten the workday and to enforce a minimum of wages

of $2,500‘a year? What has he done to secure the democratic,

rights of the toiling masses? What has he done to do away with
the semi-slave share-cropping system? What has he done to do

"away with the iniquities of Negro inequality in his state?

We say what has he done. But we might as well ask: what
has he tried to do along the lines of his promises and “share-the-
wealth” plan? T

The answer is: Nothing.

Why, then, should anybody suppose that Long’s promises for.
the whole United States are worth more than Roosevelt’s or
Hoover’s? » When and where has Long proved that he is more
sincere than these two gentlemen? At no time and nowhere.
Least of all in his own state where he enjoys full power. On
the contrary, by his own admission, he is responsible for the
election of Roosevelt and for the ballyhoo about the New Deal
being an attempt to abolish poverty in the United States.

Long has done nothing to make the American people feel
conﬁdent in him. He has done, and is doing, everything to make
the toiling masses extremely distrustful of everything he says
and does. _

Promises of such people as Long must be scrutinized very
closely and with more than a grain of suspicion. Accordingly,
we shall turn to an examination of Long’s “share-the-wealth” plan.

Cutting Down Fortunes Instead of Abolishing Capitalist Exploitation

This, then, is Huey Long’s position.

He declares war against Communism because the Communist
Party proposes to abolish capitalist exploitation which is the
source of all big fortunes on the one hand, and of all the poverty,
on the other. Long proposes to leave the system of capitalist
exploitation intact but he promises that “every big fortune will
be cut down immediately”. (New York Times, March 8, 1935.)
In this way, he says, he will make the big fellow smaller and the
little fellow bigger. He will level things out a bit.

This, no doubt, looks like a very attractive proposition. Espe-
cially is it attractive to the “little fellow”, to the small owner;
but it is liable to deceive even wage workers, proletarians, though
not to the same extent, as we shall show subsequently.

Long’s plan calls for the following measures:

1. A capital levy upon all fortunes “in excess of three or four
millions of dollars”. Long does not explain why the owners
of four-million-dollar fortunes should escape the capital levy.
Probably he has his own reasons for this.

2. This capital levy would net the United States treasury about
165 billion dollars. This sum Long promises to use as follows: ’
(a) 100 billions to provide homes, a radio and automobile to
every family in the country that does not possess it; and (b)

65 billions to provide for college education, training and main-
tenance for the youth of the country.

This is the ﬁrst part of Long’s program, his immediate plan
for the leveling out of fortunes. He’s also got a program for
the leveling out of incomes to which we shall turn presently.

Will H Work? How Can We Get It?

We raise two questions: Will this plan work? And if it
will, how can we get it realized? These are the questions to
which every listener of Long must seek an answer.

Will it work? Surely it will, provided it is done with a view
of introducing socialism in the United States and not as a utopian
scheme of ‘ equalizing_ fortunes. If your program includes such
steps as the overthrow of capitalist rule, the establishment of a
workers’ and farmers’ Soviet government, the socialization of all
large scale industry, that is, if it includes the socialist revolution
to begin with, then the proposals for assuring to each family of
toilers a home, a radio, an automobile, and all other comforts
and necessities of life become a feasible and practical proposi-
tion. But if one says, as Long does, that:

“. . . whatever the method, it will be strictly within the Con-
stitution of the United States and it won’t take as much adminis-

trative organization as we have here in Washington now.” (New
York Times, March 9, 1935.)-

he is not only day-dreaming but is also deceiving possibly him-
self, but .surely others. '

Plenty for All Is Not a Dream

Plenty for all in the United States who toil is not a dream but
a practical possibility. But only under socialism, as the ﬁrst
phase of Communism. The Soviet Union is proving that. The
wealth and technical capabilities of the toiling masses of this
country open limitless possibilities in the direction pf plenty for
all instead of plenty for the few and misery for the many.

The “chocolate soldier” Johnson laughs at the idea of plenty
for all. Why shouldn’t he? He and his friends have now more
than plenty and that’s why the masses are starving. He says: “To
abolish poverty—-oh, where have I heard that before?” (New
York Times, March 5, 1935.) The brazen cynicism ‘of a Wall

Street ﬁunkey is about reaching the limit. Where has he heard
that before? .Why, of course, from the Communist Party. But
it was not quite the same tune. that the “pied pipers” are now
playing. The plan of the Communist Party is seriously meant
and seriously fought for. That is why the Communist Party tells
the American masses who seek the abolition of poverty that:

“The necessary first ‘step for the establishment of Socialism
is the setting up of a revolutionary workers’ government.” (Mani-
festo of the Eighth Convention of the Communist Party of the
U.S.A.) '

The Communist Party, makes no extravagant promises as Long
and Coughlin do, because the Communist Party is the revolution-
ary party ofthe workers and is responsible to the toiling masses

for everything it says and does. The Communist Party points out

the following: i

“The ﬁrst act of such revolutionary workers’ government would
be to open up the warehouses and distribute among all the work-
ing people the enormous unused surplus stores of food and clothing.

“It would open up the‘ tremendous accumulation of unused
buildings-—now withheld for private proﬁ’t—.for the beneﬁt of tens
of millions who now wander homeless in the streets or crouch
in cellars or slums. .

“Such a government would immediately provide "an endless
ﬂow of commodities to replace the stores thus used by‘ opening all
the factories, mills and mines, and giving every person a job at
constantly increasing wages.” (Manifesto of the Eighth Conven-
tion of the Communist Party of the U.S.A.)

This does not indulge in demagogic promises. It shows how
it can be done———through a revolutionary workers’ government, a
Soviet government of workers and farmers. It shows in a practical
way that on the morrow after the revolution, with the wealth and
resources already available, every toiler in the United States
could be assured food, shelter, clothing and a job.

But this is only a beginning, a very ﬁrst step. Having expro-
priated at one blow the means of production of all large scale
industry, commerce, transport and ﬁnance; having made it the
socialist property of all toilers; having, in other words, deprived
the monopolies "and the capitalist class of its economic power as
well as of its political power,
