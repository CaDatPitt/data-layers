The Whistle

By Alma Plants

In a mining community, the whistle
sounding from the coal mines can be a
reassuring sound. It regulates the lives of the
families who live there, clock_s are set by it,
meals are planned-by it. It means there’s work
to be done, money to be made.

But it can also be a dreaded sound,
meaning death and destruction. When the
whistle sounds out of turn, it can mean
heartbreak and suffering.

On rainy days, clouds of sulfurous smoke
from the burning piles of slag hung heavy
over the company owned row houses that lined
the unpaved streets of the mining community
where I grew up.

I can close my eyes and see once more the
wooden school house where all eight grades
were taught by four teachers, the company
store where I would gaze in wonder at the vast
array of penny candy anticipating the
selections I would make should there be any
money left over after Mother purchased food.

I see the women of the community
gathering together for a friendly chat, while
others labor over washtubs set up on wooden
slabs by the kitchen doors doing the family
laundry. I hear the soft refrains of the tiny
hymn-singing black woman who worked daily
in her garden, hoping to grow peanuts as she
had done long ago on her Southern farm. I see
and hear the children, their laughter trailing
behind them, running up and down the dirt
roads rolling their wire hoops and balancing
themselves on wooden stilts.

And I see the miners, their faces and
clothing black with coal dust, trudging home
after their shifts had ended in the mines.
And the boards of new miners, clean and
scrubbed, walking to the mines to take their
places, answering the call of the whistle that
announces a new shift is about to begin.

Ingram Novelist

“When it,sounds out of turn, the
wives become silent, their minds
and hearts filling with a growing
dread. The children’s‘play ceases,
their laughter dying on their lips.
The men will draw together and
head for the mines to see if they can
help their fallen friend or relative,
their expressions both fearful and

angry.”

A mining community is a world unto
itself. The families all know one another and
cling close together. They laugh and cry
together and are there to help should someone
need them. But always in the back of their
minds is the knowledge that tomorrow, next
week, or even the next minute, that whistle at
the mines could blow AFTER the men had
gone down into the bowels of the earth, its
shrill blast reaching every corner of the
community and reverberating in the very souls
and hearts of the families. Someone was hurt
or dead.

When it sounds out of tur_n, the wives
become silent, their minds and hearts filling
with a growing dread. The children’s play
ceases, their laughter dying on their lips. The
men will draw together and head for the mines
to see if they can help their fallen friend or
relative, their expressions both fearful and
angry. Fearful because it could be a sonor
brother that is hurt or dead, and angry because
of the unsafe working conditions that are
common in so many mines.

Then they wait. Wait to see which
family has given yet another loved one who
has labored to bring up that black gold. They
wait, and they pray.

The first evening star had just appeared
in the clear winter sky of my eighth ye_z;g__yghcn
that whistle blew for my family.

My father was forty-two and had worked
in the mines most of his life. He was tall and

I lanky and loved a good party. Saturday night

would find our home filled with friends,
laughing and talking, eating and drinking.
He had a deep love for all his children and
provided for us to the best of his ability. He
never missed a day’s work, and lived each day
as though it were to be his last.

Then he became afraid of the mines.
Each day it became a little harder for him to
go down. So he reached a decision. He would
quit the mines. He gave his notice to his
superiors and told my mother, "I hope I never
see the inside of a coal mine again!"

Why did he become afraid after working

, all those years in the mines? I don’t know.

Maybe it was from seeking too many of his
friends maimed or killed. maybe it was a
growing sense of his own mortality. Perhaps
he just longed to leave that cold black hole and
feel thesunlight warming his skin.

Whatever his reasons, he made his plans
to move his family to Kentucky, to find
another type of work. His plans made, he set
about working off his notice and had only one
more day to work the mines. Then it
happened.

He was working a section of the mine
when suddenly one of his co-workers shouted,
"Look out!" He looked up, and the last thing
he saw was the piece of slate that struck him
down.

He wasthe only one killed that day!

I can still taste the butterscotch candy I
was eating when we were told that he was
dead, still smell the cloying scent of the A
baskets of flowers that lined our living room
where he was laid out, still hear the hushed
voices of our neighbors who came to comfort
us, their expressions a mixture of relief that
their men had been spared, and grief that their
friend and neighbor was gone. And I can still
remember my feelings of confusion that life
does go on, even though his had ended.

So, my father died in the mines and left
my mother with six girls to raise and no means‘
of support. There were no union benefits in
those days. All she received was one hundred
dollars that had been collected from the other
miners. One hundred dollars to feed and
clothe her family until her Social Security
checks started coming.

The mining company offered her the
option of moving or buying the company
house we lived in. Having nowhere to go and
children to care for, she chose to buy the house
for the sum of two thousand dollars to be paid
off in monthly payments of twenty dollars.
That must have seemed an enormous amount
of money in those days to a woman alone with

six girls.

But, somehow, she managedand raised us
in that house‘. Her favorite saying was, "God

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

.1CVCI' made a mouth he didn’t provide food =
for)’ And even though she wasn’t a _
church-going woman, I know it was her deep
faith in God that got us through because I can
never remember being hungry.

I grew up in a mining community and
now when I read in the newspapers or see on
television that miners are striking for more
benefits and safer‘ working conditions, I L
understand. For I remember the stooped
shoulders, the hacking coughs from black lung

disease, the misusing limbs, the fatherless
families.‘ They fought for and are still
fighting for-better and safer working ‘
conditions. Perhaps. with saf-er working 4
conditions that one senseless death would not
have occurred, that whistle" might not have
sounded out of turn. A

And even now, I feel the regret I felt so
many years ago that my father did notquit the
mines the very day he recognized and  I i A
acknowledgedi his fears of the mines.

Gloves €99 Goggles

By William Braasch

My first day at work, real work, not a
make believe WPA job, or cutting grass or
shoveling snow but real work for a real
company. My heart was poundingwith '
excitement, or fear, or terror, as we walked
toward "K" Building. All of the buildings
looked alike, five stories high, half a block
long but not very wide. The brick walls were
a dirty gray with multi-colored markings that
looked as if someone had poured paint down
the sides. In a few months, I would make my
contribution to these decorations.

Grimy steel framed factory windows that
identified each floor were swung open from
the bottom to let in the warm air on this early
June day, the first warm day of a cold wet
spring.’ The bright sunshine, the first hint of
summer, and the excitement of a real job
wiped away my feeling that ACE - American
Chemical Enterprise -- was a forlorn ugly
place to work. ACE made dyes, vat dyes, the
kind that would not fade.

Our guide, a personnel department clerk,
stopped in front of a door about half-way
down the building. While he tugged to open
the heavy steel door, Ed and I had a chance to
look around. I noted that there was another
door like it to the right, then looked back to
memorize the route we had followed so I could
find my way out, and back in the next day.
For a moment, I was almost overwhelmed by
the size of the plant and by the possibility of
getting lost.

The faint roar of machines became
louder as the door swung open. Inside the
door, odors that had been carried by the wind
were now surrounding me. Our work shoes
clanged on the metallic stairs as we started
up. We were in a stairwell, climbing cold
spider web steps into an unknown world filled
with noxious odors and the rasping sounds of
machines. ' '

At the third floor, the‘ personnel man
pulled on a metal door that slid sideways and
up, then motioned us to enter as the roar of
machinery attempted to drive us back. While
the door slowly slid closed, we followed him to

North Hills Retired

a small glass enclosed office. Inside, we were
introduced to the foreman who was known as
"Boomer," or "Boom-Boom" a name that may
not have reflected his size but when he spoke,
I knew where his nickname came from. As
the personnel clerk walked out of the door,
Boomer roared above the noise at a worker
standing amongs_t the pipesiand ironwork, "Get
Pat." "In here." Boomer’s name was
appropriate.

In a rather impersonal way, Boomer
surveyed the two of us, said that he was glad
to have us on the crew, and hoped that we
would enjoy working there. Without
hesitation he went through his indoctrination
routine. "Have you read the Safety Rules?"
We answered "Yes," although Boomer did not
wait for our reply. "You have a copy? You
signed a copy? There’s a copy right here," he
pointed to several sheets of paper on the glass
partition. "Read them every day. Be damn
careful out there. Never take chances.
Never."

"Put your time cards in this box when you
come on shift." We did. "They will be
signed. You pick them up when you leave. If
they are not signed, you do not get paid. That
clear?" We stammered, "Uh-huh," as Boomer

. ....r.—.. .......—...c V$ ......_....._.

 

walked around us to open the door of a wood
cabinet on the wall. "Put your lunch in
there. Never eat in the building." "Put your
dust respirator there. Not much dust around
here but wear it when you have to."

"Goggles." We fumbled the new boxes
getting the goggles out. "Put your goggles
around your neck when you leave the change
house and keep them there until you get back.
Never in your pocket. Any time you open
anything, and I mean ‘anything,’ the goggles
must be on."

Boomer paused, looked out through the
glass partition, then back at us. There was
less intensity in his voice as he went on. "Last
week a man in this building got hit in the face
by some acid. He’s gonna live -- with scars on
his face." The intensity in Boomer’s voice V
returned, "He’s gonna see. He had his goggles
on. Wear those goddam goggles any time you
are near any equipment that is open."

“In 1933, real jobs were hard to
find so we had to make good. The
equipment that we could see
outside the office was strange with
sounds more frightening then
INNER SANCTUM and fumes roll-
ing out of several openings.”

 

For a few moments, Boomer looked at us
intently to emphasize his point, then, "Gloves
you wear all the time, they’re like shoes, you
put them on and leave them on. Never touch
anything around here with your bare hands.
Put them on and rub your hands together to
work in the grease and get them to fit."

My companion, Ed, performed all of
these tasks with quick and jerky movements.
We had not spoken on the way over but he
seemed scared. I know I was. In 1933, real
jobs were hard to find so we had to make
good. The equipment that we could see
outside the office was strange with sounds
more frightening than Inner Sanctum and
fumes rolling out of several openings.

Two men entered the small office. We
were introduced to Pat and Wally. Pat, in his
early forties, was told to look after Ed while I
was assigned to Wally. ‘

As we left the office, Wally announced,
"Just stay with me. Don’t do anything until
you’re told to do it, and don’t do anything
unless you know what to do. In case of doubt,
ASK! Keep your gloves on all the time. Never
touch anything with your bare hands, this
stuff burns. Always put your goggles on
when you look at anything." All of these
statements were given as absolute laws as we ’
walked up one side of the floor and down the
other. Wally stopped at times to look at
gauges or recording thermometers. Tubs,
kettles, tanks, and autoelaves were point out.

Wally was about 30 years old, about five
foot ten, stocky build, and rugged facial
features. He was no sheik. As we moved.
along, I began to feel that Wally had a high
personal efficiency so some of my fears began
to subside.

We stopped in front of a tub about eight
feet across with a two inch thick oak plant
cover. "Put on your goggles and stand there.
We gotta drop this kettle," Wally stated. The
kettle was above the tub and dropping the
kettle meant opening a valve to drain the
kettle into the tub.

. ’ "This kettle is full of high powered acid.
Don’t breath any fumes." Wally picked up a
large wrench which he placed on the valve. W
Pushing down on the handle did nothing.
Pulling up had the same result. Stepping off

‘ the far side of the cover, he retrieved a piece

of pipe that had been hidden there. Looking
directly into my goggles, he stated, "Never use

A‘ a hunk of pipe on a wrench to open a valve.

The valve could break." Turning away, he put

’ ‘the pipe on the wrench but the valve refused

to budge.

“Then there was a kind of eerie
silence, even the noise of the
machinery seemed hushed. All
three men were set to run in case
the valve broke. I would have died
of fright before the acid got to me.”

As Wally started for the office, he told
me to stay where I was. In a few minutes, he
was back with a box of tools and other items.
Using a small wrench, he took the bolt out of
the center of the valve stem, inserted a plug of
hard grease, and replaced the bolt. I was
baffled by .this action but learned later» that
large valves used on corrosive chemicals had
to be greased.

Patand Ed appeared. Ed stood next to
me while Pat worked on the wrench to open
the valve as Wally turned the bolt to drive the
grease into the valve stem. Pcrspiration
appeared on their faces while intermittent
cuss words became more frequent between
grunts and groans. A rawhide mallet did no
good and a second plug of grease was started
into the valve. .

Boomer approached the struggle with V
shouts of "Take it easy. There’s two thousand
pounds of 110 percent acid in that
sonofabitch." Pat retrieved the pipe that
Wally had returned to its hiding place.
Holding it in front of him he looked at
Boomer in silence. The muscles around
Boomer’s mouth tightened in a wry grimace
but he said nothing. As Pat put the pipe over
the handle of the wrench, Wally finished

greasing the valve and silently moved to the
edge of the cover. Boomer backed away from
the valve, and in a low voice cautioned, "Take
it easy with that sonofabitch. We can all get
killed." , ‘ T

Then there was a kind of eerie silence,
even the noise of the machinery seemed A
hushed. All three men were set to run in case
the valve broke. I would have died of fright
before the acid got to me.

"5

Pat applied a long steady pressure to the
end of the pipe. Nothing happened.

Wally took a step_forward with the palms,
of his gloves facing Pat. Pat slowly turned and
dropped the pipe and wrench on the cover
with a clang. Wally knelt and started
removing the bolt from the valve stem.
Boomer glared at the valve, "You V
sonofabitch." Pat squatteddown to amplify
Boomer’s comment, "Dirty, rotten, no good
sonofabitch." Each time that Wally spun the
wrench one revolution, he growled,"'Bastard."
Each of the three men squatting around the.
valve was trying to outdo the other in cussing
it into submission. T i B

At‘ this point, Ed stepped forward, onto
the cover, and said, "Is there anything that I
can do to help?"

My whole world crasheddown around
me. I should have thought of doing that. "
After years of reading Horatio Alger stories
about the young man stepping forward to
solve an unsolvable problem, I hadrmissed“ the
boat. Too late for me to save the day, win the
boss’sdaughter, and own the company.

Boomer looked up at Ed through the
beads of perspiration on his goggles and in his
eyes. "Yeah," he replied, "Keep the hell out of
the way."

Wally started another plug of grease into
the valve stem. Pat continued trying the
valve. "Finally, the valve began to move. A
Cautiously, slowly, the men worked the valve
wide open.

Boomer hurried off to the office. Pat A
took the tools and Ed while Wally and I started
down the floor. "That acid sure raises hell
with those valves," was his only comment
about the incident. '

Welcome to issue #16 of the Mill Hunk
Herald Magazine, in which we celebrate the
completion of our first foundation funding
adventure -- the Steel City Stories
Worker-Writer Workshops. With the help of the
Pa. Humanities Council, the Fund for
Tomorrow, and the Westinghouse Electric
Charitable Trust, the literary efforts of some
205 workshop participants have been recorded
-- and some of that grassroots-inspired
material has landed feet first in this special
edition of the Herald. For the diligent dozens
of Mill Hunk staffers and the consulting
hoard of "Humanists" involved, the Steel City
Stories series was both a growing and
grounding experience. Currently, we are busy
coordinating an ambitious Steel Valley Oral
History and Video project that will put us,
with camera and pen, right at the pounding
pulse of Pittsburgh’s embattled working class
-- documenting the efforts to save the
"Dorothy Six" Blast Furnace of the Duquesne
Mill, unraveling the history of forced poverty
and unemployment of our black communities,
and charting the computer chip Renaissance
and how the new vertical millhunks will
organize themselves.

For the many folks who have asked us
when the next worker-writer seminar is
scheduled, all we can say for now is -- we’re
working on it and in the meantime, tell your
friends to tune in to Pittsburgh’s Community
Access Channel 21 this spring to catch the
re-runs of last year's Steel City Stories
workshop presentations.

We’re attempting to "focus" our next two
issues (this means dedicating a chunk of the
magazine to a solicited theme, not to any
exclusion of our usual potpourri of articles).
For our Warm Months ’85 edition, the Herald
is looking for short stories, narratives, oral
histories, poems, ramblings, journal entries,
anything that documents the odyssey of
women and their work. For our Fall ’85 issue,
we are being partially bankrolled by milltown
documentary filmmaker and friend Tony
Buba to dig up the forgotten fighting past of
his hometown, Braddock, the site of Andrew
Carnegie’s first mill.

The plight of the unemployed certainly
deserves prime consideration-« in all
journalistic endeavors today. Not much is
circulating, however, about the status of, those
who contributed to the giant industries of the
Pittsburgh area during the peak years, the
1‘940’s up to the recent era of decline. What
becomes of the silent hero, and of his or her
spouse, when he or she turns sixty-five years
of age? His life’s -blood is in the time span
from the Great Depression, into the years of
prosperity that raised Pittsburgh to a
Renaissance city, and finally to the present
state of economic and social uncertainties.

About fourteen percent of the population
of Allegheny County is over sixty-five years
of age (199,566), and of these 55,637 live alone
(Census Tracts of Pittsburgh: 1980 Census
Population and Housing).

An aged widow, Lucy Fusco, whose
husband worked for Westinghouse Electric in
East Pittsburgh for well over forty years,
consented to share her views of her status now
that she is alone.

The new seven story high-rise towers over
the small, struggling business district of
Swissvale, Pennsylvania; it appears a gray and
gigantic intrusion against the row of
antiquated, squat, one-story shops across the
street. The designer’s attempt to provide
pleasure to the aged, who give up cherished
homesteads tollive in small, secure dwellings
with "their own kind," is evident in the small
outside balconies finishing off each
apartment. When passing by the place on a
pleasant day, one expects to see the tenants
sunningthemselves cheerily on the little
terraces, but the areas are usually all vacant.
The two long benches in front of the building
are accompanied with a small square of grass '
and shrub, dusty from the constant stream of
traffic along Monongahela Avenue. Ah
observer will find three or four men and
women sitting on the benches, chatting idly,
watching the motion of the cars, and alerted

from time to time by the screeching of breaks
and tires at the traffic light on the nearby
corner. -

A visitor is allowed entrance when a
tenant answers to the loud buzzing from the
pressing of a button at the main door, and the
caller is identified on the intercom.‘ Inside,

* the square, tiled floor lobby is cool and quiet.

A few tenants may be sitting about on the
leather cushioned chairs, watching a visitor
coming in, and there are smiles and hellos
exchanged as the outsider waits for an
elevator.

Lucy is in a unit at the end of the hall on
the second floor. She is waiting, with the door
open part way, to peer out and to greet me. It
is difficult for her to study a face, through the
thick lenses of her glasses. She stares hard,
opens the door wide, and when inside in the
better light she smiles and thanks me for
coming.

Unsure of her footing, bent in posture,
the small woman struggles with the aid of a
cane to her favored place in the center of the
room. her rocking chair is the only item
reserved from the past; it is a sharp contrast to
the few "modern" pieces about: the floral,
cushioned sofa and the matehingchair, the
maple end-table with the lamp with the
multicolored little shades, the small round
dining table in the corner by the door.

She settles herself into her chair and
places the cane on the floor, close to her.
There is also a walker within her reach,
behind her. There is evidence of a routine in
solitude: the telephone nearby for emergency,
the rosary beads on the arm of the chair. The
television screen wears a layer of dust that is
obvious in the light from -the window. With a
quick glance the layout of the apartment is
easily discerned: a small bedroom, a bath, and
a tiny kitchen are in a row opposite the length
of the sitting room. *

Lucy’s_crown of white hair is uncombed
and bears clusters of irregular, stiff strands.
A button is missing on her dark plaid house
dress.

~"My son, Vince, comes every morning on
the way to work now, to help me out of bed.
He wants me to go to Illinois with my
daughter, but I don’t want to go!’ I fell last
week and hurt myself so bad! If you can’t

she said. ‘ .

boys come at night and smash my glass door
and call on the phone and say bad "tings to

She broke down. She tightened her light
blue sweater about her as she cried, and she
lifted her glasses to wipe the corners of her
eyes with a tissue. - v

"My husband and I come to Swissvale
sixty years ago, to a tree room house. Papa go
to work in Westinghouse. We raise our tree
children here. I have friends and they come
now. Angela Conti comes from down_the
street. I bring her into the world! Her
mother was my good friend, but she is gone
now, and Angela says I am her second
mother. Angela comes and she helps me to get
in bed at night."

 

"The people in this building  they love
me! They see me downstairs when I used to ‘go
to the parties in the hall, before I fall. The

’ people come and hug me," she relates with

pride. ' . V

"One lady, Connie, she’s sneaky! She
went with me to the doctor’s. She won_’tgive
my Medicare card back to me when I ask.
And she took two purses from my room. She
said no, when Iask her. And one day she
comes to the door and throws the purses inside
on the floor. She said I give the purses to her
but I never did! My Medicare card, it was

- inside one of the purses. No, the people here

know now, Connie took my purses, they don’t
like her any more. "She’s a tief!" she cried..

"Our Gaetano was in Children’s Hospital
ten months  his kidneys  so sick  I go every
day to see him and the doctors and nurses say
don’t come! Your son is too sick! I slip when
the nurse come down the hall after me. The
man was mopping the floor. I break my
arm!"

She struggled with the walker later, to
the tiny, windowless kitchen. The counter
about the sink was crowded with an
assortment of plastic containers and lids, balls
of string, plastic bread wrappers, plates
standing haphazardly on a drain rack, a few —
soiled glasses. She got a can of soda from the
refrigerator and asked me to open it and to get
glasses for us from the cupboard. She set the
walker aside and settled into a straight chair
at thelittle table, continuing her story.

"In the depression my husband was laid
off six years. Westinghouse give a little food
ration  Papa work with WPA for fourteen

. dollar a week, once in a while. He had the

little garden, and I bake bread two, tree times
a week. Our kids have enough ~ never go
hungry. '

"Papa never buy a car, he never learn to
drive. I have a huckster come to my door I
every Tuesday and Saturday and I tell him he
wants too much money for the tings and ‘
sometime I get a little cheaper," she said with a
chuckle.

"1 know Mario in Caserta. He work in the
factory where I work for a while. ‘The girls
all watch the boys pass outside, at dinner
time. We all like to look, to say "Salute." We
all like Mario. He look so nice, talk so nice,"
she said with a smile, revealing the absence of
upper front teeth that I hadn’t noticed
before. ‘ P

_ "My uncle send the money from America V
to my mother for me to come here in 1921. ’
Tree times he send the money! Two times my
mother spend the money for food. The tird
time my uncle says this is it! So I come to live
with my aunt and uncle in Patterson, in New
Jersey. I was twenty-one year old. I work in a
shirt factory. I give some pay to my uncle,
and I send some to my mother. I‘ find out
Mario come to America too and I write him a .
letter to«Pittsburgh. He come to see me in
Patterson." There wasa silence now as she

I spent a moment in reflection."

“Papa went back to work in 1938*”

and we buy -the house on ,Wood-
stock in 1940. We pay 40 tousand
dollar. I rent the upstairs rooms to
help pay the mortgage. When I sell
the house I get tirty tousand!”

"The foreman was trying to breakup the
Italian gang. He don’t call Mario back to
work. I tell my neighbor, Mrs. Rhinehardt, to
call the bigboss at Westinghouse for me,
because I can’t speak good English to him.
Mrs. Rhinehardt tell him we have such a sick
boy. We got a letter the next week. I wait for
Papa to come home. I can never open my
husband’s letter! When he open it he smile ~
because it’s good news to come back to work!
He went out right way to buy safety glasses
and safety shoes. He never wore the shoes."

"Papa went back to work in 1938 and we  , 

buy the house on Woodstock in l-940..We pay

"I give some money to grandchildren
' because they smart and need education.
Education is good. My grandson has good job
now in business  what you say? Compute..."

"Computers," I said.

"Yes. And nothing can beat this country.
I like Italy but I don’t want to live over there.
I’m here since 1921. I die here," she said, with
solemnity.

Age,

that mad pharmacist,

bottles-up

knee and knuckle joints,

corks a pilled memory with cotton.
Messages adrift - '

your grandfather’s farm near Grassflat PA,
his Saint Bernard, chores to be done -
harrowing, plowing, thrashing.

Forgetfulness: —

boils water from your tea kettle,
crackles its red enamel paint,

blankets your dignity

like the toast in your oven each morning,
eases

unexpected visit by the gout, ‘the willies,’
the uninvited cold that never leaves,
reminds

a willing spirit

to buy natural hair color in a tube,
hearing-aid batteries, lotterytickets.
Yes, terrible odds, but hopes.

Lucy sets herself comfortably into the
favorite chair, near the long window, with the
draperies aside. She doesn’t play the TV any
more, cherishing the quiet of evening.

The sun was beginning to set over the
borough community in a majestic, late
summer, pink sky, and the shadows would soon
begin to intrude into the cell-like room where
Lucy Fusco recalls the embellishments of her
rich and poignant past.

hope they keep down the price of gas. I shoot

"Cheeseburger" - Gang of Four

In Kalamazoo, celery used to grow in the
swamp bogs, north of town. was rich soil
suitable for growing corn and raising cattle.
On the river the mills churned out paper, rolls
and rolls of paper. In Detroit, the motor was
cranking, turned over by farmers from the
south who came to work in the auto plants.
Good land was expensive, people built on
sand.

There were things to do with sand,
castingmetal, and from that came the Jeeps,
the pumps and the refrigerators. Stock cars
raced around sand trackson the weekend.
For a sand farmer it was less of a gamble to
work in the factory.

The glaciers carved away some pretty
hills into the landscape, they left lakes and
sand dunes. In the back of one sand hill was a
machine shop that made chucks, like the chuck
that holds the bit in the drill, only larger and
more precise. Accurate to a ten-thousandth of

an inch. Not a measure of any man, but that
of a machine where small tolerances are a
virtue.

In the shop, bars of steel were sawed,
drilled, and machined into chucks. The din of
the machines wound down to a deafening

, silence at lunch time. The last sound would

be the hissing of the air hoses as metal
particles were blown out of pant cuffs and
pockets. The parts were stacked in the parts
bins, red plastic containers with "Buck Chuck"
stenciled on the side. Pranksters had covered
up parts of the letter "B" on some of the bins,
not unlike the way that Pharaohs had chiseled
off the names of former rulers.

Jean was always careful which bin she
used, and made a fuss over getting an altered _
bin which moved around the factory like a '
greasy rag. I used to go to the union meetings
with Jean, and then stay afterwards to shoot
some pool. Once in a while we would go out
and have dinner at Denny’s if they were
having a special. Jean and I got to be friends
after I started buying her l.unch. Jean loved
hamburgers and there wasn’t enough demand
to have them in the vending machine in the
lunch room. Jean was the oldest employee in
the plant, it was her idea to put the canteen in
from the very start. But all they put in was
soup, cokes, and chips. No hamburgers...
which were Jean’s favorite food." With most
of the guys playing poker or drinking beer in
the parking lot, there wasn-’t much she could
do to satisfy her craving except drive into
town, and there wasn’t enough time for that.

McDonald's lowered the price of
eheeseburgers to fifteen cents for one day
with no limit on how many one could buy. I
bought a shopping bag full of burgers and
threw them in the deep freeze. At six in the
morning I would throw a couple of burgers in
my lunchbox and by noon they would be
almost defrosted. A quick trip to microwave,
and alacazam! an instant cheeseburger.
Everyday Jean would go to the vending
machine and look for the cheeseburgers.
After a week she got up enough nerve to ask
me where the burgers were coming from; I
gave Jean a cheeseburger, and when she
pronounced it o.k. I always put an extra one
in the microwave.

After a few months, and quite a few
burgers, I decided it was time to leave. I was
ticking off the moments until I could go home,
just like everyone else. I guess I knew it was '
my last day when I let the foreman talk me
into loading too much on the old saw. A steel
bar fell off during the run and landed just off
my toes. A loud clang broke through the noise
of the factory. I felt like staying; the Bucks
were nice people to work for and the bucks in
my back account were alright also. I thought
I would try and stay one more day, so I came
in the next day. I talked with the guy who
had the night shift on my machine and he was
really pissed. A steel bar had fallen off the
machine and landed on his toes. The steel

V part of the boot took the impact and was

completely crushed. It was time to roll.

Come From

John Moyer
Squirrel Hill Chef

The sugary Swiss Miss escapes,
struggles from a kitchen cupboard,
flops to the counter top,

begs the Pillsbury Dough-boy to make love.
But that giggly goo i

cannot rise

to this occasion.

She tempts his corporate heart-

frozen pudding bars, <

instant cocoa with mini marshmallows,
yodeling steamy whispers

to an earless snowball.

He perspires,

edible eyes widen,

legs doughy.

Something swells between thighs.

They stir into an emotional mix,-

spoon themselves onto an aluminum bed,
bake,

with a four-hundred degree passion.
The kitchen, house,

air fills thick,

chocolate cookies

cascade from chimney,

tumble

down gutters,

drop into jars.

Quiet fingers slip inside,

dip us in milk at midnight.

Waiting in Line

Shucks I forgot the paper. I wonder if I

should tell them I have a job. No, you haven’t

made any money yet selling vacuum cleaners.

I‘m supposed to be somewhere after 10.
Well you didn’t get here till 9 o’c.iock; what do
you expect. If you want that coveted place at
the last ash can you’ve got to get here probably
before 8:30. But I can’t; I have a small child to
get off to school. Yes, that’s right, okay, so
don’t kill yourself over it. You couldn’t get
here till 9 so you have to wait in line.

Cross my arms. No, that’s bad body

was; you know, what’s his name, oh yeah,

McCall’s Magazine. Figures. Well hopefully a
man’s magazine has an article called "What do

Come to think of it how curious there are

Hey where’s that guy going he’s breaking

it works. Boy he’s really cute. He’s got a
khaki jacket on with elastic around the waist.

— It looks so sexy when it’s left unbuttoned - like

a little skirt sticking out half over his ass.

The hood strings dangle on his chest. He
is looking very distracted but important. He
has longish hair with a bald spot starting at

of a grand scheme - I’ll bet - oh yes he’s
probably got a world of his own packed up in

The Blue Collar

By Jim Walsh
Castle Shannon Caseworker

Ignoring the kids, the estranged little
woman and the droning TV, the Struggling
Working Class Working Writer turns his
attention to the struggles of the working class
working writer.

Insecurity and sloth, he decides are his
major obstacles. With time, he’s quick to
justify, running a close second. Tick-talk. No
shit though, take his day, his 24 hours and put
them in a box. Grab ten for getting up,
getting ready, riding the streetcar, doing his
job as a welfare caseworker, then coming back
home. Give him an hour to shake off the
stupor of the first ten. Take out four for
eating, reading, managing little league teams
and time with the kids. If he gets six for
sleeping, that leaves three for making love,
developing relationships, experiencing art and
nature, exercising, partying, thinking and
daydreaming, which brings us back to
writing. And with the box just about empty.
But who's counting?

 

So it’s hard! The SWCWW is not afraid of
tough rewarding challenges. He is, after all,
of the working class. He finds no value,
however, in his present occupationgcasework
is hard but totally unrewarding. There is no
sense of accomplishment or quality in the
paper haze. Workers decharacterizing amid
ambiguous policy, aimed at definition and
control and disseminated like innuendo.
Everything about his job is gray except the
people, who come barely alive in black and
white. He’s on a line pulling off the papers
that apply to him, filling in blanks with
terminal data. His body is for hire but his
spirit ain’t, the SWCWW has to get out. So he
finds the time and in the dark of night,
lighted by the power company, he raises his
pen in hopes of expressing one coherent
thought that might help stem the onrushing
tide of man’s inhumanity toward man... or at

the very least earn him a couple of bucks.

“He is face to face with the main
hurdle, looking it dead in the 1. He is
oppressed by the knowledge that
religion, history and fiction have
historically and religiously been the
‘soul’ creation of the aristocracy.”

But it’s almost 2 a.m. and the giddy
SWCWW has a silent laugh at his cliche‘d
display of passion, as if writing (his writing)
could have any effect on anything at all. He
is face to face with the main hurdle, looking it
dead in the 1. He is oppressed by the
knowledge that religion, history and fiction
have historically and religiously been the
"soul" creation of the aristocracy. The
SWCWW sees himself as a supporting character
in some rich fool’s drama and is distressed by
the apparent fact that so many of his fellow
supporters so sheepishly accept their minor
roles. Don’t they want to be stars too? He .
wonders. Is his just an isolated case of ego?
A bit-part extra, uncharacteristically
demanding center stage? "Listen to me," he
implores of the cast in general, not too
confidently, over the objections of the
directors, "it doesn’t have to be this way.
Reality is just a convenient argument for
those without imagination."

The SWCWW is dealing now in heady
subjects and wonders if maybe he won’t be
coming up a few cards shy of a full deck.
Most of the people he cares most about would
not have read this far. The realization cuts
him to the bone. And what about the rest? Is
anybody with him? "I don’t know," he
answers rhetorically. Whistling in the dark
best sums up the situation. Ten years of
part-time evening undergraduate work, and
(arguably) pretty impressive list of reading
and a couple of drawers full of effort is what
he’s got to indicate his interest. He has pretty
much sacrificed his role as participator in the
course of human events for the sake of
observation. There is much to be learned
about writing, he has observed, but little that
can be taught.

In short the SWCWW'has some good news
and some bad news. The bad news is that
writing is a most difficult undertaking. The
good news is that he can begin now. With
writing, the proof is in the putting, right?
Write.

Wrestﬁng
  with moral
dilemmas

By Larry Evans Homestead Steelworker

My very first encounter with a "gut"
moral conflict occurred when I was a
5th-grade, bubble-gum-chawin’ barbarian.

My mother, a devout German Catholic whom I
affectionately tagged "the War Department,"
saw in me nothing that a nice bath in a
cleansing religious experience wouldn’t
straighten out.

Her first parental impulse was to steer me
into sports as the sure path to constructing
character, but she quickly soured on the idea
upon observing the lack of "adult" influence
coming from the dugouts. Those Little
League trenches had reduced that enabling
Grantland Rice adage -- "a boy would always
rather steal second base than an automobile" --
to a modern creed of "go in with your spikes
high and, if you lose, slash their tires." So, at
11 rough-cut years, I was about as
one-dimensional towards life as a Topps
baseball card and bordering on irreverent
toward all other pursuits. I

Next spring Mom announced, "The pastor

_has chosen you to be an altar boy." There I

was, stewed in the great institutional melting
pot of church and sport.

My first Mass was opening-day Sunday. I
was fit to be tied for two reasons: it was a high
Mass -- fluffed with more time-consuming
rituals than a rosary has Hail Marys and it was
a noonday event and my game was at one.

As I piously led the pastor out of the
saeristy to open the service, he suddenly seized
my elbow and pointed disapprovingly at the

_ six unlit candles. I could feel my mother’s

mortification 12 pews deep.

So, while choir sang and pastor proceeded
with his holy duties, red-faced rookie altar
boy strained with a swaggering eight-foot polc
to set ablaze those six candles. The
congregation’s amusement routed the
solemnity of the ceremony. Murmurs rose

steadily to outright belly-laughs. You see, as I
went, hell-bent, from candle to candle, my
outstretched arms uplifted my cassock to
reveal splendid yellow-and red-striped
baseball socks. I had figured wearing my
uniform under the sacred garments would get
me to my game by the bottom of" the second
inning. '

All sins were, of course, forgiven and I
miraculously became an ace altar boy --
eventually getting so absorbed in "the faith"
that I briefly considered, the seminary. But as

is the problem with all new believers, there are.

also new devils to be confronted. After
hearing nuns’ tales of demon’s possessing good
kids and throwing them out of bed in the
middle of the night (as a test of their "faith"),
nightmares began visiting me regularly. I had
to do something to set my mind at ease and the
more dramatic the action the better.

One evening I ventured out into an
isolated clearing in the woods behind our
house with a steak knife and an ultimatum: I
"OK, if you exist, Devil, come on with it!"

The longer I waited around, the more idiotic --g

and relieved -- I felt. A forfeit, I won 9—_O.
There was, in fact, no absolute evil out there
worth steak-knifing. Naturally, this also
prompted me to reconsider my certainty of an

' Absolute Good, which made me a worthy

candidate forthe next eights years of a Jesuit
higher education.

 

 

 

I’.m sharing these little vignettes from my
b3_Ck8T0llfld to warm you up to a necessary but
painful dlSCl.lSSl0n of a moral dilemma
currently facing our Mon Valley.

The dilemma is this: Two polarizing
developments have been happening here in
post-industrial, Renaissance 11 Pittsburgh. One
by one, working-class communities arebeing

~ ushered out the back door of the

middle-class. And in the '80s gold rush to
merge, shutdown and reshuffle, the wealthy
are shoring up their capital gains, IRAs and
Enterprise Zones at an alarming pace.

Many of the‘ new poor have been "called"
to the unemployment offices but thus far very
few have been "chosen" for high-tech jobs.
Organizations which normally act as a buffer
between competing classes -- unions, parishes
and community groups -- are in real trouble.
The frustration of a permanently lowered
standard of living in mill towns is exposing
more and more raw nerves. Class resentment
ishigh.

I found no one who liked the taetless
approach of the Network to Save the Mon

Valley, but most people agreed that something
had to be done to stir the conscience of
Corporate Pittsburgh. There is a growing
consensus, too, that churches should entertain
the sensitive economic and social concerns of
the day. ‘

But disturbing the "sanctuary" of the '
church was a bad move. Mocking the
profit-mad "achievements" of ivory-tower
executives can educateand generate public
sympathy, but harassing their families is
stooping to revenge. Besides, people are much

_ more a product of the system than they care to

admit. All the preaching in the world to
individuals will lead nowhere until the system
itself is reformed. . 0

Finally, I know several of the peoplein
the Network and many of,their. friends who
believe in the sincerity of their intentions and
complete commitment to union solidarity.
These are not slick union or church
bureaucrats protecting their positions. These
are working-"class fighters trying desperately
to get you motivated. Now is the time for
more good people to start doing something.
Remember. "The game ain’t over ’til it’s over."

The End .

The black and white set flickered an oft ignored tale of love and loss.

His mind registered none of it;

The Angel approached and in a frustrated fit of disgusted rage

Tossed a loaded gun onto the bed.

"Use it! End it all then," he .challenged.
He stood back to measure the ripples.

The once proud head turned slowly from the gray images.

A soft voice sighed quietly.
"I already have," he said.

I roiled at the end of rivet fused arms,

shrieked expectant ecstasy down the terror

I feast on eyes that desire present pleasure.
Devour the plumped-up patter of passion.
Tongue hairy hollows of dissonant cravings-
Suckle at the transient moment for

flavors of enduring intimacy.

A ride into joy and out to pain
on the other side of the slammed closed door.

Thrill drairled, I tumble out, away again into

Momma

By Mary Wilson Sage '

Bloomfield Nurse

Every day I treated the old lady’s foot,
wrapping it ever so carefully, as loosely as
possible while still keeping it secure. I had
chosen the roll gauze with the greatest
flexibility to cause the least pressure to her
ulcerated foot. Each day I would return to
her home to find the dressing gone or in such
disarray that it might as well be gone. She
had pulled it here and snipped. it there.

more ailments than a few sore

c

toes.”

, “I know what you’s sayin, she
would tell me. “But you don’t know.

9 .9)

what I’se feelin.

When asked about this, the patient
exclaimed, "Whooee! I couldn’t stand that
pushin’ on my toes nohow, especially right
there on the ends 0’ them toes." Kneeling on
the floor before her, working, I would, look up
into her dark face to see if she had
understood, and she would laugh, her eyes
twinkling.

That hearty, ageless laugh would stop me
every time. "I know what you’s sayin’," she
would tell me. "But you don’t know what I’se
feelin’." V A truth indeed!

The same thing happened when we
discussed the swelling in her feet and legs. I
struggled with language to have this lady
understand the mechanics of circulation and

‘how the swelling increased with the

dependency of her feet. There was no foot
stool, so we found a box, padded it and made a
hassock. I explained the importance of her
being in bed at night, and hopefully for an
hour in the middle of the day. I encouraged
her to elevate her feet when sitting. "Give ,
your heart a break," I told her. "It doesn’t
have to work as hard when you stretch out and
get your feet up."

Again, she told me, ‘'1 tries. I goes to bed,
but that pain wakes me up and gets me
hoppin’. I has to sit up to get it stopped.

Then I sleeps sittin’ in the side of the bed."

We talked about how to use her pain
medication to the 'gr'e“ates‘t'bencfi't. The effect
was limited. The degree of her pain and its
persistence troubled me.

Throughout this time, the patient’s son-
sat deafly by the window, watching the world
go by in the street below, turning his back,
unable to face the impending loss of his ;
mother. 9

One day, the patient’s daughter was there
and I tried to enlist her support, hoping she
would reinforce my instruction for her
mother’s care. "I know, I know," was the
daughter’s response. "She’s just hardheaded!
Wait ’till her baby daughter gets here. She’s
the one who will make her listen. She’ll say,
‘You hear, momma? Now you gotta do just
what the nurse say. You hear?’ And she’ll do
it, too, if her baby daughter tell her to."

That caught my fancy. "Her baby
daughter?" I asked. "How old’s her baby
daughter?" knowing that she was no spring
chick.

"She’s seventy," I was told, "And Momma
listens to her."

Whether or not Momma would listen to
her, I didn't know, but I knew that, for now, at
least, Momma was going to do exactly as
Momma pleased. And I wasn’t going to fight
with this robust soul who had survived one
hundred and five years with no more ailments
than a few sore toes.

Graphic by Joy Topitzer

Then one day, "baby daughter" blew in --
just like a whirlwind! She took control and,
indeed, everyone listened to her -- except
Momma! I noticed that her brother absented
himself for long periods, leaving his place by
the window. he would listen, but he had his
limits. "Baby daughter’s" son flew from the
West Coast to see his grandmomma. Unable to
bear the thought of losing this woman who
had reared him, he returned home to his
psychiatrist.

Finally, "baby daughter"too told me, "I
just have to get home for a bit. Momma’s
wearin’ me down." She took the week-end off
and drove home to New York.

The days passed, and the weeks. The
condition of the patient’s foot deteriorated.

as the circulation failed. The pulse to the foot
weakened. The pain increased.

Momma went to the hospital and returned
home, saying, "No more hospital, no more
doctors, no more treatment. I can’t take no
more."

We sought to keep her comfortable and to
avoid more problems. "Baby daughter"
returned, supporting her mother's decision.
"She’s so miserable," she would cry to me at the
door as I left. "I can’t see her go through any

beginning of the end. It would be the toes,
then the foot and then the leg. And fo

Momma gradually weakened. Her heart

faltered and became arhythmic. Then it 

would rally. The medication would ease the

pain. Then it returned with even greater F
ferocity. Her appetite failed. Unable to 
sleep restfully, her whole body wearied. One
system after another yielded.

Then one day, her condition worsening,
she admitted to weariness with pain and
dependency and life. She was constipated, too
weak to pass the stool through her bowel. We
discussed the options. Finally, the old lady
agreed to the enema, but told me that she
couldn't sit on a bedpan. I told her that we
could give the enema while she sat on the
bedside commode.

 

Freeing the bucket from the chair, I.
placed it on the floor beneath the chair. Her
two daughters placed their mother on the
chair while I filled the enema reservoir with
soapy water. One of the daughters held the
enema bag while I climbed behind the
patient. Crouching there in cramped space I
managed to accomplish the procedure. It was
awkward but successful.

on strike." We shared in her laughter.’ I was ‘
going on vacation. Fearing that she might be
gone when I returned, I leaned over and gave
her a hug. She returned it and we laughed

 

again through our tears as we said "good-bye."

I met the priest on the front steps of our
house as he came out. His hands were slowly
folding a purple stole, and the top‘ of his bald
head shone in the afternoon sunlight. I could
not see his eyes to read any emotion in them.
From where I stood transfixed, the priest
looked like any other man on the job -- doing
his sad, repetitive‘ chore. When he saw me,
Father Muranti sighed. The breath of duty
escaped, and I knew the news was terrible. He
may have tried to speak to me, to offer some
words of consolation, but I had no time for
that. I brushed my shoulder against his as I
hurried into the house.

    

0lJ°:l UUK1 Kq ogqdeug

It was strangely silent. I had expected‘
something  wails of grief, brothers and sister
scurrying about, some sort of activity. But
the house was still and ordered. In the
sunlight which fell upon the stairw.ay, dust
circled and stirred with my movements and
then slowly settled to the rose colored throw
rugs covering the wooden floorboards. Not a
soul was downstairs. To the left, the sitting
room, as Mama called it, was empty. The
stuffed threadbare chairs held their places.
The Edison with its face the shape of ,
Cathedral windows, was not tuned in. On the
walls, the paintings stared back at me:
Madonna and child; a jowly St. Brendan the
Explorer; Christ the Child, in red robes,
holding in one palm‘ the world His own, and
the other hand raised in blessing -- two fingers
joined by one gold band are extended from his
babyfat hand. To the right of me, the dining’
room was cold and barren. I went in and put
down my cardboard suitcase on the table and
listened as my Father’s heavy footfall took the
steps one by one.

"James," he seemed surprised to see me.

 

The word came out of his mouth as if this was
the first occasion he had uttered my name and
his own. I made no move to him, nor did I ask
about Rose. In one word, the timbre of his
voice, the tenseness of his jaw, he revealed

I that she had indeed died. He had sent for me

that morning, but I had arrived too late from
schooL

"I’d better get a fire going," he told me as
I sat down and tried to let the shock sink in.
"It will be dark soon and cold tonight." He
went about his task as if nothing had

"I - happened, or as if everything had. There

were no logs in the fireplace, only kindling,

L and this he rearranged to form a nest. From a

pile he had gathered some time before, he
chose a fat log and placed it along the rear
wall. In the front, he set two smaller logs
gently on a pile of sticks as if_the wood were
glass. Around these he positioned yesterday’s
Sun-Telegraph and with his thumbnail, he lit a
match and touched the flame to all the right
places. My Father knew a thing or two about
fires.

"You had better go see Mama," he told me
as he poked about with an iron. "She will be

. glad you are home."

I wanted to talk with him about Rose. To
tell him how sorry I was for his loss, our loss.
He looked over his broad shoulder at me. His
face was red against the fire, ‘and his coal
black hair and long sad moustache made him
look as fierce and hard as the molten steel he
stoked. Yet his eyes betrayed him.
Somewhere in his heart, he wanted to talk
with me too. To unburden his grief. But in
an instant, he snapped back to the fire. "Go
on, son," he said.

My legs were heavy as I climbed the
stairs. I felt as if I was going down into a

4 deep, dark cellar instead of up to my Mother

and her dead child, my sister Rose. In that
momentl wished I could turn and run, go back
to school and forget this had ever happened.

If I could go at that instant, it might not have
happened. But the long living cord between
mother and son was pulling me to her. I could

hear her cries before I reached her, see her red

swollen eyes, feel her cool hands upon my face

as she pulled me to her chest, back into her

arms, her heart, the deep and aching pit of
Mother.

But she did none of these things when I
saw her standing in the bathroom doorway.

‘ seem as if she was always pursed to kiss.

Drawn around her was a worn maroon robe,
and her hair hung down long and loose and
full of gray. She actually smiled when she
saw me and called my name,,and I ran to her
as if I was sixyears old and threw my arms
around her and held her long. I did not want
to see her face, but at last she pushed me away
and held me at arms’ length. "Let me see my
boy. You look so fine. So healthy. My
college boy..." And she held my checks in her
hands and kissed me on the lips. "Now don’t
you worry about me," she said. "I’ll be fine."

"But Mama, she was just a baby."

She turned and looked at the room where
Rose lay. The blonde pine door was closed
shut, and behind it only silence. My mother
looked to the ceiling and pressed her
fingertips to her lips. The hands were as red
and rough as my Father’s, and around her
mouth, tiny wrinkles had formed to make it

"Rose is with Jesus now, Jimmy." And she
stood locked and rigidyas a statue, her eyes
closed, for some time before I stopped shaking
in her arms. ’

Downstairs the clamm-er of my brothers and

sister returning home from school rose from

the foyer. As I stood next to my Mother, I
heard my Father’s muted voice stop the

children in their places. His words were not
clear, but he had a pace and rhythm pulled

from the softness of his heart. The two
younger children, Finn and Megan, began to

cry when my Father had finished.

"Go see them," my Mother said above
their screams. "You must see that they are -
bathed and fed. Your father will have togo
to the church and the funerabhome, and 1..."
She broke down and sobbed. , I put my arm
around her and led her to the bedroom. Inside
Rose lay in the crib, but I hadn’t the courage
to look her way. Mama lay down upon the ,,
bed, and I rolled the covers over her trembling
shoulders. In a moment, she was curled like a
ball, like a sleeping baby, and I crept out of
the room like a hare passing a fox’s den.

11'

When he returned home, my Father
dressed the baby in a white lace Christening.
gown. I stood beside him in the dark of his
bedroom as he pulled her arms through the 1

 

 

 

sleeves and brushed the laeework with his
heavy hand. He did not cry over Rose, at
least I never saw nor heard him do so. When
he finished, my Father lifted his last child and
placed her on a whitesatin pillow. He stood
over her looking at Rose’s silent, almost happy,
face. In the lamplight, I could see his eyes
search her features and look to her still chest ,
as if he could will her back to life. In a flash,
his mood changed, and he turned to me as if to
speak, to comfort or reassure me, but saying
nothing, he left the room and me alone with
the baby.

She was still small. I had thought that in
a month’s time, an infant would grow; but she

F looked as delicate and porcelain as the day

they brought her home. She was fragile from
the beginning. During that first week, there
was a terrible scare for my parents. Mama
had even called Father Muranti to come '
baptize her and perform Extreme Unction.
The old Italian priest baptized her with tap
water poured from a blue porcelain dish with
a wreath of pink roses around its rim. That is
why we called her Rose. She hadn’t a name
before that day, and naturally, Mama thought
the name would bring her child much luck and
grace. Three weeks later, Rose was dead, and
for the first time, she wore the Christening

V gown that my parents had saved for nine

months to buy.

I wanted to will her back to life as my
Father had tried todo. Since I was the oldest,
and Rose, the youngest, I had a duty to her.
She was my charge, my care. All the prayers I
knew, my Mama’s glass rosary, the Latin that I
chanted, did not work. She just lay there as if
sleeping, and when I touched her forehead, I
felt the coldness of death in my palms. From
the bureau top, I picked up the baptismal plate
and held it to the window. The moon had
broken free above the smog, and beams
skittered along the windowpane. As I held
the plate to the light, I thought I heard a cry, a
whisper,’the sound of a baby breathing. So
startled, I dropped the plate, and it broke into
shards on the metal radiator coils. I thought I
had awakenedﬁhe baby. Sobbing myself for
the first time, I picked up as many pieces as I
could see and put them on top of the bureau.

A single rose had broken free, and I put that
in my pants’ pocket as I left the room.

In contrast to the darkened bedroom and
upstairs, the sitting room was bright and filled
with sound. My brothers, Oscar and Finn, and
my sister Megan were huddled together at the

radio listening to Lightning Jim on the
Meadow Gold Hour. Outside the wind blew up
the face of the hill and swirled in the icy
eaves of our house. The children, dressed in
their robes and slippers, shivered and looked
so small and frightened to me. Megan's
checks were raw and red with tears, and Finn
looked blankly into the radio face. Only
Oscar, the oldest next to me, cared about the
program and how "The Ghost Riders" were
going to catch the bandits. It was close to
eight o’clock. Mama was dressing for the
visitors to come paying respects and mouthing
their condolences and how sorry they were for
her and all of us. I put on my coat and
stepped out into the night.

Below lay the valley, the lights of all the
homes glowing in the cold and dark. Farther
away, down the Monongahela River, the steel
mills glowed and smoked like candles in the
smog. At night, it was not so bad, this city in
the hills. Gone from sight was the dirt and
grime, the ragged houses clinging to the sides
of hills and rocky roads snaking up and up.
Gone was the silt in the air, on the snow, on
your clothes and hair, in your lungs. , You
could not see nor feel it so in the night. I was
glad to have escaped this place, this furnace,
the rot and decay of Depression, of men out of
work, out of luck. This January, this first
month of the last year of the decade, was as
cold and forbidding as the beginning of our
troubles. And Rose was dead.

From the house, I walked across the face
of our steep backyard to see the lights. For
the greater part of an hour, I stood there
looking at the hills, the river, and back again
at the house until I noticed the lights went out
in the sitting room and the glow of candlelight
took over. I went to the window and scraped
off the ice to form a porthole so that I might
look in.

At the table sat my brothers and Megan
all in a row, and Mama stood behind them all .
dressed in black. The room was dark except
for two candles at either end of the table. I
saw a shadow pass in front of me, and then I
spied my Father. He was carrying Rose as she
lay on a pillow, he was carrying her at arms’
length as if she were a crown or a birthday
cake. Each child was shown the baby, and
they bent their heads to kiss her as she was
presented, and then Papa laid her between the
candles, and we all bowed our heads in
prayer. "Rest in peace," I whispered to her
from my cold place at the window, "and so
may you all. And so may we all."

The Woes of a Writer
(and an Editor)

 
 
  

Beechview Piano Teacher

The final meeting of the Mill Hunk
Herald Writers’ Workshop was held in the back
room of Hemingway’s Cafe on Forbes Avenue
on June 27, 1984. The atmosphere was easily
likened to a scene from one of the renowned
Ernest H.’s works: bare wooden floors, and
rustic booths along the wall, occupied with
depressed young couples pondering over
sweaty glasses of beer; dim hanging lamps; a
bar opposite the row of booths, with noisy
chatter and laughter.

It was a hot summer evening with rain
and the air of the back room where the writers
came was stuffy and smoke-filled.

A panel of distinguished guests included
Don Hopey, Pittsburgh Press; John O’Brien,
United Press International; Bill Moushey,
Channel 11; Peter Oresick, University of
Pittsburgh; Jim Daniels, Carnegie-Mellon;
John Zingaro, free lance writer from Point
Park College. The speakers, in turn,
contributed advice on good writing style,
approaching a prospective publisher, and the
need for persistence in attempting to sell one’s
work.

The room was packed with a working
class crowd: men and women who tend to Blue
and White collar jobs, housewives, retirees, all
seated about the square tables listening
intently to the professional advice.

After the question and answer session ’
there were scheduled one-to—’one meetings for
individual critiques on works submitted for
evaluation. There was a lively chatter among
the group as all awaited calls for turns to meet
one of the men from the panel in one of the
booths among the row along the wall.

I was informed by a coordinator that my
session would be with Don Hopey of the
Pittsburgh Press. I sat at a far corner of the
room, watching my newsman in his booth,
with the woman called ahead of me. The two

were intent on the manuscript the woman held
before her. Would he receive me and my own
work favorably, I wondered. I thought of the
piece I had submitted for him: a profile of an
84 year old woman, "Sunset," and of the
revisions on it throughout the early weeks of
the workshop series. I glanced about the
room, studying the faces of the many people,
sweaty from the heat of the place.

 

Hopey will be with that woman all

night! I told myself in my growing anxiety.
The pressman was strikingly handsome in
business suit, blue dress shirt and thin-knit,
maroon tie. He had loosened the tie a little at
the collar, and this added to my stereotype
conception of a fast-pace reporter.

I asked a girl standing near my chair
what time it was and she said ten thirty.

I overheard someone saying she had just
come in from a raging thunder storm
outdoors. We would never hear it here, in this
noisy dug-out, I thought.

A young waiter hurried in and out from
the bar with trays of beer mugs frothing
over. Expressionless, the boy-waiter dug his

  A Fresh Sheet of Paper

By Reiko Yano
Lawrenceville Artist

"Tears fell from her eyes, like wet
pebbles." .

Umm.
"She burst into tears, like a broken dam."
Oh, man.

"Tears dropped from the corner of her
eye, like dew from a leaf before dawn."

Aw -- to hell with it.
"She cried."

And so he wrote, a boy just out of high
school. He started his first short story. He
wanted to write about Roberta.

He had heard about Roberta being loose. '
He paid no direct attention to her or the
rumors about her but privately, he would
think about her sometimes. He belonged to a
co-ed group that played volleyball regularly in
the school field. Sometimes, they would have
a party at one of their houses but the parents

,were always present. - Once in a while, one of

them would sneak in a case of beer and maybe
a couple would form in a corner, kissing and
whispering. The guilty couple would always
be shunned by the rest of the group, though,
for several days after the party. It wasn’t a
very sophisticated group. i

So, when Michael thought about anyone
outside the group, he kept it to himself. In
fact, the group didn’t know him very well --
they didn’t know each other very well. They
stayed together out of fear. The group didn’t
know this, but every other group in high
school was the same way.

Michael began to realize all this when he
met Roberta. It was a hot spring day in the
senior cafeteria. He wasn’t allowed in there
since he was still a junior but he was well

liked by many seniors. His clean-cut look and
status as assistant editor of the school
yearbook helped him to" get acquainted with
the most popular ones. It was the first time
Michael saw her alone. She was usually
surrounded by five or six girls, all dressed in
highly risque manner, either dancing to,
rapping with, or shouting over a tune blaring
out of a stereo radio. When he saw her in that
way, he wanted to just look away. But
sometimes her eyes caught his before he

could. Her eyes were always bright and
smiling but her mouth was still busy rapping
or shouting with her friends.

She was alone that day. She was alone
and striding quickl/y towards him. She
hoisted herself over the low wall that was the

' senior barrier, and when she landed, she

landed right in front of him.

"Hi, Michael!"

How did she know my name? V

IOHLII

Shining. She was shining. Beads of sweat
popping out on her forehead and nose. Her
panting breath enveloped him.

"I’m Roberta." The sound of a rapping

tune was coming closer. "Look, I gotta go --
look me up in the book!" And off she went.

“In fact, the group didn’t know
him very well - they didn’t know
each other very well. They stayed
together out of fear. They didn’t
know this, but every other group in
high school was the same way.”

That’s how it started. He didn’t know_
exactly why he looked her up in the student
directory. He just couldn’t forget that shining
face. She had a knowing look. Squinty eyes,
thick lips partly opened, a crooked smile. But
that shining face was blushing.

 

 

H

Even as he dialed her number, he was
expecting trouble. That expectation mingled
with his feelings about his group caused
excitement he had never felt before. A very
skeptical voice of her mother on the line only
fed to it more. By the time Roberta came to
the phone, he was determined to start seeing
her.

Perhaps if they had more time to
themselves, their relationship would have been
stronger. After their third date, Roberta

found it amusing to call him "my man" at
school. Then it began to suit her to call him
"my MAIN man," especially in front of her
wild girl friends. By then, it was summer.
They could have gone of on their own then,
they could have talked more honestly about
what was happening. But everyone went to
summer school, including them. He sensed a
change in the group. The boys elbowed each
other every time they saw Roberta run up to

. him and the girls started to drift away from

him. Her friends -- the "bad" girls -- flirted
with him. Right in front of Roberta!

He realized what everyone thought.
Except, Roberta told him one day that she was
glad they were not, and that was why he was
her "main man." She said she felt something
"spiritual," something "different" between
them. ’

He was excited, too, that summer. He ,
played volleyball with the group more often
than ever and although he noticed he was not
invited to a couple of their barbecues and a_
beer bash or two, he realized he did not care.
He felt good when he saw Roberta. She was
funny, innovative, and she obviously looked
up to him. They felt awkward in school,
either in front of her friends or his group, but
the few nights and numerous summer days
they were alone brought them closer and
closer. ‘

One summer was not enough. When the
fa_1l term began, Michael suddenly found
himself to be the chief editor of the
yearbook. Since it was found out that the
previously_elected chief editor transferred out
of school, the staff had an emergency election
and he was chosen. He became very busy. He
couldn’t go to many volleyball games.
Eventually it became too cold for any games
and he completely stopped seeing anyone in
the group socially. Others flocked to him,
though, wanting to be more visible in the
yearbook. He was invitedto their parties.

He took Roberta to several, but she didn’t , ,
eri joy them because they didn’t play music she

liked and they played what she called "stupid"

games.

Friends

By Janet E. Pishok
Clairton Freelance Writer

Iyreally miss Alvin. Him and me used to
be the best of friends. Idon’t know what
came between us; it all happened kinda sudden
like. One day we wuz takin a walk together
down by the river -- me catchin a couple a

V crabs in the shallows and him throwin a few

good skippers across the water -- havin a
helluvagood time. The next day, he never
showed up at our usual meetin place, and I
ain’t seed_him since. V

“Alvin, he uiux_a lot older’n me.
I’m seven’n a half goin-on eight, and

he wuz ipushiniseventy, but I didn’t .

care. We wuz the kinda friends that

that stuff didn’t matter.”

 

We‘d met a couple a years back -- in a
cemetery. I know that’s a crazy place to make
a friend, but see I'd been chasin this kid I
knew. Hezmusta ducked under the fence an
cut through Pete’s place to get home.
Anyways, I wuz runnin around thinkin he was
still hidin behind a tombstone, or bush, or
sumthin, when I bumped into Alvin and we
just hi-t it off right away.

Alvin, I found out, lived up in Sylvania A
Heights. I come from Horton Street, which
ain’t that far away except there's a gully in
between where the road don’t go through.

Alvin, he wuz a lot older’n me. I’m
seven'n a half goin on eight, and he wuz
pushin seventy, but I didn’t care. We wuz the
kinda friends that that stuff didn’t matter.

We didn’t even have to-talk much. Alvin, he’d
smile and pat me on the shoulder and that told
me a lot more’n all the yappin I’d hear
sometimes. He did tell me one day though, he
had a bad ticker. When he first started
walkin, he couldn’t make it to the end of his
yard ’thout gettin all out of breath. Later,
he’d gotten up to five miles a day and felt real
good walkin -- and that wuz right down my
alley. V

We’d always meet in the cemetery, which

i wuz about halfway between our two places.

He liked to spend some time talking things
over with his wife who wuz buried there. I
didn’t think there wuz nuthin wrong with
that. I often did it myself -- I mean talk
things over with friends when I couldn’t
understand sumthin. If he wuz busy talkin
when I got there, I’d just hang around nearby
until he wuz done. Then he’d say, "Well,
friend, where we going taday," and I’d shoot
off, eager to show him sumthin maybe he’d
never seed before.

,.._...__...............-;.....

. .,.....,.,_--,...,,..__,..

Alvin and me found some great stuff on
our walks. Once I spotted a family of mice in
an old tin can behind the Simpson place. I
didn’t like going there, cause the Simpson kid
took a pot shot at me with his air rifle once.
Nuthin ever happened when I wuz with Alvin
though. Alvin, bein real tall, could see a lotta
things I couldn’t. One time, he picked me up
and showed me a bunch a baby birds in a
bush. They wuz all squawkin mouths n
leathery skin -- ugly as sin. I’d never seen
anythin like that before and I kept jumpin up
tryin to see em again. That wuz the only time
Alvin ever yelled at me. Like I said, Alvin
and me wuz real good friends.

One day we hiked down over the hill
through the woods. Alvin wanted to show me
sumthin. He wuz going slow cause it was
steep and there wuz loose rock in under the
leaves makin it bad walkin. Me, I didn’t care,
cuz I wuz young and close to the ground. I’d
often run circles around him, feelin my oats n
all, but he’d laugh and tell me we’d always get
to the same spot, only it’d take him a lot less
steps. It was a hot day and by the time we
reached the bottom, my tongue was hangin
out.

"Figured you’d like my surprise," Alvin
sez as he knelt beside a small stone trough that
caught a trickle of water coming out of the
hill. "This here’s Jacob’s Spring. Been arunnin
clear and sweet like this for moreina hundred
year now."

, Real careful like he scooped out all the
leaves and debris, including all the water that
lay in the trough. At this point I got more’n a
little perturbed and told him so. There I wuz
near dyin of thirst and he wouldn’t give me a
drop. Some friend.

""You’re too hot to drink yet. Wait a
while. It’ll taste even better," he said and
pushed me back.

Lordy, I thought that trough would never
fill up. The longer I waited, the thirstier I got
and the slower the water seemed to seep from
between the rocks.

Finally Alvin cupped his hands, tasted it,
shut his eyes and smiled. Then with the water
still dripping tantalizingly off his chin, he
nodded.

drunk a lotta water, but this wuz sumthin

-were. My family always stuck pretty close to

. nose. He didn’t say he wuzlonely and missed

Now I’ve been thirsty plenty a times and

special. Put me in mind of eatin snow and
lettin it melt down slow. It wuz so cold, it
made my teeth ache and had a taste like
nuthin I’ve had before or since.

When we’d drunk our fill, we laid down
in the grass near the spring, men Alvin, side ‘
by side. That wuz the day he told me about
his wife; all how he met her when he wuz in
the service out in California. Thelma wuz her
name and she wuz originally from Topeka. I
didn’t know where either of these places

 

home. Alvin and Thelma had two kids that
were growed up and livin in two more places I
never heard of. Seems they were pretty close /, 1
and used to do a lot of things together. He
used to bring Thelma down here, he told me,
and sit just like we were that day.

His voice sounded funny at this point and
he pulled out his handkerchief and blew his <

her -- a friend just knows these things. He‘ .
reached over and rumpled my hair and I wuz
glad he had a friend like me to tal.k to.‘

Goin. home, we cut through the bottoms
and up an old road that wuz easier walkin.
Alvin seemed kinda tired and lost in his own
thoughts, so I just stuck close by in case he
needed me.

 

Near the top, we came across a dead coon
lying along side the road. I got excited and
wuz all for takin it home to show my family.

But Alvin sez kinda sad like, "Maybe it
wuz sumbody’s Thelma. Leave it be."

PPJ|l|ll=|uag9Aq3m¢_.3

. ,. ,,,._ 
s -"W." wmn. _ .. I

 

I felt real ashamed of myself, bein his
friend and knowin how he wuz f eelin that
day. I shoulda known better. I wuz slinkin
along, feelin pretty bad when Alvin stopped
and laughed. :»

"We’re a couple a fourteen carat sad sacks

‘ today my friend. Let's stop and get us some

ice cream on the way home."

That suited me just fine and I knew
everything was okay between us ‘again.

Almost every day, in all kinds of
weather, Alvin n me took our walks and never
seemed to miss finding something new. Then
came that day when he didn't show up. /

‘I “I think my family knew sumthin
wuz wrong, yet I could’t talk about
it. This wuz different -- I could feel it
- and didn’t know what to do. I had
no idea where he lived; I never
needed to. He was always there...”

 

  

Now, we’d both missed now and then
when it was icy, rainin hard, or the snows too
deep, but that day was a‘ beaut and he’d never
missed on a day like that. I kept lookin up the
hill waitin for him to come all full of apology
for bein late, but he didn't —- either that day or

‘ the next. I think my family knew sumthin

wuz wrong, yet I couldn’t talk about it. This
wuz different -- I could feel it -- and didn't .
know what to do. I had no idea where he
lived; I never needed to. He was always
there.... '

The third day as I rounded the curvelnear
the cemetery, my heart skipped a beat. There
were people and a lotta cars; maybe Alvin-
would be there too. When I got close, I could
see someone had put a tent over Thelma’s
grave. It was raining, but not hard enough to
keep Alvin away. We’d often walked on days

V like this, yet I couldn’t find him anywhere.

There were people all around the tent holding
umbrellas, and I was too short to see past the
first row.’ I tried to squeeze through, but
everyone frowned and pushed me away. I
wuz pretty wet by this time.

That’s when I got mad. What were all
these people doing here anyway, trampling all
over Thelma’s grave and the flowers that
Alvin had planted so careful like? What
business did they have coming here without
A1vin’s say so? Boy, if Alvincould see what
they were doing, he’d be plenty mad.

But he wasn’t here. Now,Vme'bein his
friend, I thought somebody ought to tell em 
and so I did.

"Get away from here," someone hissed.

Another raised his hand threateningly
and said, "Git!"

But I wasn’t about to stop until everyone
cleared out of there, so I kept it up.

More people turned and stared irritably
at me, while one of them asked, "Whose dog is
that?"

"He’s from up on_Horton Street. Casper’s I
think. He’s the one’s been taking walks with
Alvin for a couple of years now. Guess he’s
got as much right to be here as anyone. Old
Alvin thought a lot of him. Often said, he
couldn’t have found a better friend."

The Third Floor

By‘ John Mayer
Squirrel Hill Che'f -

A Two tall and sturdy maples frame my ‘
childhood in Pittsburgh -- only a couple blocks
from Schenley Park, Panther Hollow, and a
quick bicycle ride to Forbes Field. My brother
Mike and I stay on the recently finished third
floor. Poor ventilation up there always makes
it too hot in the summertime. Although we
both try to keep cool, that light-blue,
twin-engine, electric fan sits in Mike’s
window. He’s older. The fan’s calm and
rhythmic whirring helps, but it’s just too
sticky. "I CAN’T SLEEP," I complain in
Mike’s direction. He tells me to think about
baseball -- sliding into third for a triple, or
diving for a shoe-string catch in right field. I
scan over our poster of Roberto Clemente, to
admire the old black and white uniform he
wears at Forbes Field -- the way he cocks his
head from side to side, easing stiff neck
muscles; his poised bat, the angle of swiveled

;hips and slightly bent knees; a shifting of

weight from right foot to left, as h'e steps into

I ' the pitch, mating ironwood with horsehide.

"Anger gives me energy," Roberto once said.
Even "in pain, he played with a quiet dignity.

I begin to half dream about playing ,
speedball in the alley across the street. "AND
HERE HE IS... NUMBER TWENTY-ONE...
ROBERTOOO CLEMENTEEE..." My words
echo as I pose in the oblong batters box, in A
front of an awkwardly chalked strike zone on
the alley’s crooked stone wall. The pitcher
winds up and delivers the fresh, white, rubber ‘

.ball. It smacks the lower right corner,

"STEEERIKE." The little orb springs
unpredictably off one of the stones in the
wall. Mike runs to retrieve it in the thick

dandelions and young sycamores thriving

along the wooden fence in our left field of
cement. He winds again, fires a fast ball, and
I swing. A lonely but perfect "PAWK" rings in ~
my ears, as the spinning, now lopsided sphere
meets my Louisville Slugger, slowly floats over
Mike, up to the fence, skips off one of its f
pointed posts, and shatters a once wide pane of
glass. We quickly gather our bats and gloves,
scamper to the sanctuary of our home -- up to
the third floor -- to search for the nickels and
dimes needed for a fresh, white, speedball at
the Five & Ten.

My Forever Stone      I

\
By May McCormick

Pittsburgh, PA

Sitting on the shelf of my curio is a stone,
given to me by a dear friend. It is not much
to look at and it does nothing but sit. The
stone is three and a half inches wide, and four
inches high.

It rests on a small wooden stand that
shows it off to its best advantage. I can
remove it from the stand and hold it in the
palm of my hand. A

The color is gray, the lettering on it says
"Forever," done in black writing. . There is
‘nothing fancy about this stone and it is not
valuable in terms of money, but is very, very
dear to me.

When I am blue, I look at it, pick it up
and it reminds me of "happier times." it also
reminds me when I am lonely, that I have a
friend forever, and I only have to call tohave

I

him at my side. , ~

In this life, I don’t think there are many
things as steadfast as a stone, I also do not
think there is anything dearer than a steadfast
friend. i

‘ I care for this stone as I would a friend
because every time I look at it, I am reminded
of him, my friend. “

. Pig-in-a,-Poke

By Lenke Schlesinger
Retired Swissvale Nurse

In the stress of the work-a-day world,
there is not too much time to do what one
might like to do. How often have I thought
that it would be nice and relaxing to have
some time to leisurely do what I really wanted
-- no time-clocks to watch, no deadlines to
meet, no other people to interrupt my thoughts
or my comings and goings; just a few days to
myself to use either constructively if I wished
or to squander if I wished.

Then one day when I came home from
work, I realized I was facing just such a
situation. I had three days off from work and
no plans. I was living alone, so there were no
family members to consider in whatever I
might decide to do.

A After dinner I sat down to take stock of
the situation. I turned the TV on to get the
weather reports so I could better plan my
activities. ’

I thought of the things I could be doing --
there are letters to be answered, there are
several books I borrowed I should read and
return and so many other things that had been
neglected. I finally decided to start with
letter writing.

I went into the den and over tothe desk,
which in a time of need,I had purchased in a
It is very old and from all
appearances it had had hard use. I thought I
should get a new one, but it is like an old
slipper, I hated to part with it. I had heard
that furniture refinishing is a very satisfying
hobby. I decided then and there to attempt to
do this. It should keep me busy for a while.

The equipment to start is minimal -- paint
remover, sandpaper, steel wool, and elbow
grease and plenty of that. As the layers of old
paint are removed and the bare wood comes
into view, the grain stands out and the pattern
it forms is very interesting and beautiful.

Why was it covered with so many coats of
paint? The desk is actually warm and alive.
In my musings I could smell the fragrance of
the pine forest, feel the carpet of needles
under foot and see the sun filtering through
the tops of the trees producing a pattern of
light and dark on the ground.

I shake off the mood and start the actual
refinishing. It is going to take longer than my

- three days of freedom; the process is long since

there must be a 24 hour interval between each
step. I set aside an hour or two each evening
to work.

As I go through each step, I think of the
history of the desk. A father probably made
it for a son to use, who probably passed it on"

to his son and so on through several

generations, until one decided it really was too
old and should be discarded.

As I work, I thinkof the day’s events and
its frustrations and as I am sanding and oiling,
and sanding and oiling, the beauty of the
furniture is brought out, I start to relax and
feel I am better able to cope with the problems
of the coming day. A

Finally I am ready for the last step. The
last coat of oil has been absorbed and has

dried. With very fine steel wool, I will give it ‘

the last sanding. The finish is as smooth as
satin with a gentle soft patina; the patterned
grain shows through. As I regard the desk, I
do not see the desk I had purchased at the
second hand store in a moment of need, but a
beautiful piece of furniture re-created which
has the warmth and mellowness of age, with a
new chaptervadded to its history. -

Larry Evans, genteel, concerned, came
over to me, with his schedule sheet in hand.

"Did you k.now,'you’re next with Hopey?".
he asked cheerfully.

Finally, the woman left the seat in the
booth that I was to fill! I gathered up my
sweater, my purse with straps,,and my‘
over-sized notebook, and I hurried to the
booth. Don Hopey sat erect, his papers laid
neatly beforeshim. There wasa tallglass
filled with dark beer within his reach._ _

s I hurried-ly threw my ‘purse and sweater

I to the end of the seat and I slid into the booth,

all in one gesture. I laid the large notebook A
before me on'th,e table, but before I could
react, the binder hit- the tall, damp glass of
beer. I gaped in wide-eyed astonishment a's_ »
the brew splashedin every direction across the
table, splattering Hopey’s neat white note pad,
the ‘heaven-blue shirt, the creased trousers, the
shiny black shoes. The reporter held his ’
hands in the air a moment, then he grabbed his
notebook to look closer, in disbelief. He bent

to the soakings of his clothing, the ugly puddle"
across the floor, shaking his dripping fingers .

in helplessness.

"Gees!" he barked. I decreased to zero in
ego size. I hurried to grab tissues from my

purse, and I’ wiped the table frantically. The ,
tissues were soon soaked, and I used the

remaining dripping little ball they had
formed, to continue in ‘a gesture to blot his
notebook, making it worse.

"I’m so sorry! Here, get your shoes!" I
told him, finding a fresh tissue somewhere at
the bottom of my purse. "Please, let me buy
you a fresh beer!" ‘ ' '

At this offer he looked at me with T ,

‘frowning consternation and said,'."No,, thank

If

you.

The loss of composure was momentary.
He soon regained his posture and his
professional focus. He lined uphis spotted
notes and brought my_ manuscript from the
seat beside him, where it had escaped _th_e
deluge. I immediate-ly noticed that he had
spared my work the usual marginal criticisms,
and had written them numerically, in "a
column, on his own note pad, to go over. with .
me.

V I froze under the rstare of those
ponderous, penetrating blue eyes, unableto _
erase theexperience of the accident from my
nerve endings. The critic, however, was
unswerved from his serious intent: it was back
to the work at hand -- "Sunset."

Thank you, Don Hopey, wherever you
are, for not leaving the booth in despair, for
not turning around in your favorable, .'
comments on my submitted-work, for not
deserting my near-‘sinking ship in the back

feel like I am about to lose mine. What can

My body’s refreshed, showered, powdered and all gussiedtup-

I can smell sweet clover, feel cool wet grass between by sandals,

I leave the peaceful hills of lazy, grazing cows, and crackling

I zip along the serpentine roads, alone in blissful serenity, but

for one farmer already planting his wheat.

My worlds change abruptly, as I_enter the angry traffic. The forty A '

My eyes are drawn toward the large harp glistening across‘the,river.

The music played is the rhythm kept by the pounding feet of the

harried workers as they pass from one end of the bridge to the other.:

Overhead is the whirling roar of the giant, flying, mechanical bird ' '

giving the daily "headache reports" to the weary travelers below. '

A tractor trailer has left an untimely, unwelcomcd load of lumber’ ‘ I

along the Forbes Street exit into Oakland and the entire area is

retirees, nurses, teachers. bus drivers, bartenders, you
name it.
WHO CAN WRITE FOR THE HERALD: Anyone can.

 MILL I-IUNK
_ HERALD

"The Hill Hunk Herald is one of the most exhilerating and
important publications I have come across in recent years.
At a time when the gap — and it is a wide chasm, exploited
_by demagogues - between the blue collar people and the
"intellectuals" separates Americans, one from the other,
the Mill Hunk Herald is a candle in the darkness."
-Studs Terkel

"I'm glad to have the Hill Hunk Herald. It's so human. It's
so deeply rooted in life. I can't be sure what my own writings are rooted in.
I think maybe I'm running a hydroponics experiment here - raising plants in water.
The quality of writing in the Herald is first rate, which doesn't suprise me. Hhen
I teach writing, my main message is that the writer must really care about his
subject. If he cares, suitable language will arrive of its own accord."
Kurt Vonnegut

Dear Folks in Aquisitions,

We hope you enjoy reading this complimentary issue of our quarterly magazine.
The Hill Hunk Herald began in 1979 as a response to the lack of democratic access
., to the traditional press and it has become a model for how grassroots publications
can be operated. Our stories come from the horse's mouth, no professional writers
are involved, and we'd love to be able to reach your constituency.
Please send in the tear sheet below. Institutional subscriptions are only $10
a year (for 6 issues). Thank you for considering us!

On Russian Hill

"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to ‘
dust, in sure and certain hope of
resurrection.”

There were very few lived in houses on
Russian Hill among the scattered, isolated,
black-wooded shanties that remained from the
early settlers of the last century. Every
several months a shack burned due to
vandalism or spontaneous combustion spurred
by rotted age. Berry bushes and stretches of
high, dry grass surrounded the abandoned
shacks and partially hid the few lived in
houses set away from the knob face of the
hill. The slightest smell of smoke always
sparked a great commotion.

It was a lazy Sunday afternoon in
November, a record breaker in the
mid-seventies, when Georgie Robbson when to
explore the hillside since the last fire earlier
that fall. Georgie had loafed in front of
Mac’s store for an hour waiting for his friends
to turn up. Since no one came, he grabbed
several packs of matched from the counter and
went to Russian Hill alone.

Georgie knew very little of the valley’s
history, but had picked up bits of information
by listening to the grown-ups talk in Mac’s
store. He remembered what people had said
after the last fire. They had talked and
talked about it for weeks.

"Those shacks on Russian Hill are older
than your daddy." Mr. Carter had said to
Georgie. -

A man at the counter buying cigarettes
said, "They s-hould’ve tore them shacks down
long ago."

"A good fire up there would set that
whole hillside ablaze," said Mac. "All of
Wilmerding and Wall would see it."

A good fire. George had always dreamed
of a good fire: The whole valley lit up,
reported in all the newspapers, on television,
men like Mr. Carter would talk about it in the
mill, at the bar, in Mac’s. The valley would be

By G. Musinsky—--Wilmerding Poet and Teacher '

famous. At the age of twelve, Georgie was a
clever lad.

After a short walk out Station Street, he
charged the steep, red sandy slope.’ Hands and
feet slipped on clumps of loose dirt and shale
as he scrambled to the dirt trail above. His
first quick steps and pantingspooked a
ringneck pheasant from nearby bramble
bushes. Honking, it flew to the Wall side of

‘the hill. Wall and Wilmerding were sister

communities t-hat stretched along Turtle
Creek. Railroad tracks ran East and West from
Wall, parallel on both sides of the creek, sepia
colored from sulphur and otherpollutants
deposited by local industry. Two main lines
led directly into the Westinghouse Airbrake ‘
and other mills further down the valley.
Georgie had often heard it said: "If the Wall
trackyards weren’t there, then the Airbrake
wouldn’t be either." And without the
Airbrake Plant, there would have never been a
Wilmerding. Georgie had wondered where he’d
be if that were so.

“Georgie had often heard it said:
“If the Wall trackyards weren’t

brake Plant, there would have

. never been a Wilmerding. Georgie

had wondered where he’d be if that
were so.”

As he strolled along, he pulled at plants
unknown to him. They were brown and dry,
brittle little fibrous bulbs like cotton
protruding from the stem. Plopped down in
the grass, ‘Georgie broke the roots of one to
chew on and watched three back-to-back

V diesels roll through the valley at high speed.

There were no passenger cars. It was one of
the'express freights that usually came through
during the week. After the train passed,
Georgie jumped when he heard a man’s gruff
voice.

Until then, he thought he was alone on
the hill. Guilty - scared, he crouched in the
bushes and moved around the hill to the other
side. There sat an old man on a shallow stone,
dressed in faded blue coveralls and-a gray
Union shirt. A striped engineer’s cap leaned
against one ear. Smoke swirled around his
head rising from the pipe clamped in his
teeth. The old man turned and focused his
-eyes on the bush Georgie hid behind, then
resumed. his crow-like gaze at thetrackyards
of Wall. The final cars and green caboose
disappeared beyond the bend._ Curious George
walked over.

"Watcha doin, Mister?"

"Watching time go by," said the old man
without looking.

Georgie shrugged off the strange words.
He was fascinated by the man’s appearance.
Longish, snow white hair curled down to his
beard, unspoiled by gray. His eyes were opals
shining beneath shopworn cheeks. He was a
real railroader. '

"Did ya used to drive ’em mister?"

The old man wasn’t listening.

, "The trains. Did ya used to drive ’em?"

"I was fifteen when I first worked with
the railroad and in fifty years I never drove
one."

"Whadya do?" .

"Everything but drive them."

"Like what?" '

The old man smiled. Georgie’s innocent,
doll-like features screwed up into a face full
of perplexity. The old man knocked his pipe
against his boot.»

"I was a track laborer until the war.
After that, a brakeman and many years after A
that I worked as a yard supervisor. The
railroad was a big thing in those days.

_ Without it, nothing went nowhere."

Georgie kicked a stone down the hill.

"My dad works in the Airbrake."

"That’s good."

"How’s come?"

"Without the Airbrake Plant, people
would never have settled in Wilmerding.
Without the railroad yard in Wall, the airbrake
would have been built somewhere else. And '
without the intention ofthe airbrake, trains
might not have been used as much and Wall
may not of ever had aytrack yard."

"I thought Wall was just another dinky lil’
town like Wi1merding."

"At one time, near as many trains went
through Wall as through Boston."

Georgie’s eyes rolled open wide.

"Oh yeah? Boston? I ’member readin
’bout that in geography class. And
Westinghouse, I read ’bout that dude in
history. Mrs. Burger always told us how V
important he was."

The railroader stirred his pipe with a
special pipe tool. He pulled a tarnished gold
lighter from his left flap pocket. For Fifty

« Years Service was engraved on the case.

"The railroad gave me this. It doesn’t
work very well anymore."

Out of youthful friendliness, Georgie
handed him a book of matches.

"Aw, go ahead, keep ’em. I got another
pack in my pocket." ‘ \

The old man glared.

"And what do you have matches for?" he
asked.

"For cigarettes!" Georgie snapped. "But
I don’t got none right now."

"Your dad know you smoke?"

"Yeah. Sort of. But he don’t say nothin." I

"As long as he doesn’t know," said the ‘
railroader adjusting the pipe in his mouth."

"Yeah, I guess so."

“It’s all history, but not the kind
you can learn in school.” “I guess
this place was really important at
one time, huh?” “Important to the
people who made it and lived it.”

"There’s been a lot of fires on this hill."

"Oh yeah. Ain’t there though. Mr.
Carter says it's ’cause of the dry grass and

them 01’ shacks. Says they get so dry up here,
that the sun sets ’em off."

"It’s more than just sun that burns this
hill, year after year."

"Why?" Georgie asked. He was serious.
"You live up here?"

‘ "At one time."
"Yeah? Which house?"
"Burned down years ago."
"Know who done it?"

"Don’t need to."

A thundering airliner screamed and
Georgie and the railroader looked skywards.
In the last glimpse of daylight a quarter moon
hung limp and glowing, as the jet swooped
past

"Wow! Didya see that! Looked like that
plane went right over the moon."

Silent, the railroader turned to the subtle
movement in the trackyard far below. A
shabby blue workrhan’s trolley inspected a
section of track where used boxcars are moved
from the main spur. Thin yellow clouds of
foundry smoke drifted from the Airbrake,
over the creek and spread out in wispy layers
over Wall.

"That’s what killed us," the old man said
under his breath. ‘

"Huh?"

"You know son, there’s enough railroad
track in this world to reach around the moon
and back?"

"No sir!"

"Yep. But you could never build a rail
line to the moon or over the ocean for that
matter." '

"I guess ya couldn’t, could ya?"

"It’s all history."

"What is?" \

"This is," said the old man looking down ‘
into Wall.

Down in the yard, a whistle sounded and

a shuttle engine pushed empty boxcars on to
the side track, away from the main line. On
the back of the engine a man swung a‘ red
lantern up and down and was answered by a‘
switchman with a similar swinging of a
lantern.

"Most of the people’ that lived on this hill
worked that line down there." ,

"Yeah. They were all Russians."

"No. They weren’t."

"Why’s this called Russian Hill then?"

"The first people in this valley were
English, Irish, shopworkers and Italian I
tradesmen, Western Europeans. But the people
who settled on this hill were Ukrainian
immigrants. Because of their thick accent,
they were mistaken as being Russians."

"I never knew that. But ain't Ukrainia
part of Russia?"

"At that time, it wasn’t."

"Is that what ya mean by history? All
this?"

"It’s all history, but not the kind you
learn in school." "I guess this place was really
important at one time, huh?"

"Important to the people who made it and
lived it."

"Is that .whyv.«.you si‘ up here? to make
sure nobody burns it down?" ..

  “At one time, near as many trains
went through Wall as through
Boston.”

 

Again the whistle wailed in the yard
below, while the shuttle engine scrceched and
reversed its movement. The man with the
lantern now swung the red glow side to side.
Darkness had settled and the engine light

glimmered across the tracks and glazed over
the creek as it moved on.

''There’s nothing left to/burn."

Little Georgie stood up, realizing he was
late for supper.

"Well sure been nice talkin wit ya. I
gotta go. Anyway, I’m kine of chilly. Be .
seein ya’, mister."

Leaving the old railroader silent, Georgie
walked down the slope with his hands in his
pockets. he nearly reached the bottom when
he saw one of the old shanties leaning to one
side, half buried in the hill with the roof
caved in. The matches were damp in his hand
curled tight in his pocket. He ran overand
kicked a pile of grass and dry leaves together.
A cool breeze blew across his face. Hunched
over, he tried to light a match. The flint was
wet. He tried again with another pack.
match after match smoldered on the pile.

- Finally, Georgie kicked the pile apart and

gave up.

Crossing the Station Street bridge,
Georgie stopped and looked for the old man on
Russian Hill..It was too dark to see anything
but he thought he saw a flash high on the
ridge. Because of this, he dumped the
remaining matchbooks into the creek, and
walked home. ~

After a late supper, Georgie went to his
room, ready for bed. While staring up at the
ceiling, Georgie envisioned the strange, white
haired railroader and pipe churning smoke, '
and wondered. Sudden fire whistles jolted
Georgie out of bed... Breathless, he ran to the
window in his underwear and peered across
the valley. All of Russian Hill was ablaze!

Snow

\It’s clean! A A

Winter’s cleaning time has come;
Nat_ure’s blanket has unfurled
To cover all our browns and grays.

Dusty gravel lots are cotton beds;
Junk cars and garbage cans:
Glistening white humps.

Backyards of sidewalks and telephone pole shrubberies

Gleam with sugar coating.

Silence settles atop the white.

Blaring horns and slamming doors hush;
Muted tones don’t carry. _

The world whispers...and smiles.

Day After X~mas

Anna Man_so—— Munhall Homemaker

Disembodied members,

Scattered across the floor,
Broken wings and unrobed kings,
They reign until they're poor.

Shattered glass and grounded angels,
Spaceships that never fly. A
Broken toys and hopeless joys,
Another year gone by.

I.O.U.s and union dues,

Needles everywhere.

You put it away and still you find,
Tinsel in the air.
