Twentieth Century Methods

COMRADES, you and I have been working hard on

various Party tasks for a long time. We have met
with varying degrees of success. We have done some
very good work, and tried hard to carry out our tasks.
But we all agree that 1936 is not 1926 or 1932 or even
1935. As they say, “time has marched on.” Events
have moved rapidly. And so of course have the cir-
umstances under which we Communists are building
our Party and Party press. We use the radio, both
nationally and locally. We are working for a national
Farmer-Labor Party, we are aiding the C.I.0. organ-
ization drive, etc., etc. These new methods are being
used in our 1936 battle, the battle between fascism and
democracy. A battle in which we Communists {are
leading because the Communists are the real Americans
of today, and because “Communism is Twentieth Cen-
tury Americanism.” We must lead in the struggle of
winning the masses of America, not only ultimately for
a Soviet America, but today, in 1936, for the immediate
struggle against fascism, and for democracy.

Comrades, this means entirely new methods of work
for our Party, for each single Party member. To be
sure, our Party has adopted new methods of work and
has, as a result, been meeting with tremendous response
from among the masses. It is our central Party task in
this period to reach not only the Workers right around
and sympathetic to our Party and its program, but espe-
cially the Wide strata of workers, farmers, middle class
people, small business men, professionals and intellec-
tuals who are not close or sympathetic as yet to the
general Party program and aims, but who are willing to
ﬁght with us on the side of democracy against fascism.
We must win these Americans to the side of democracy
and also tell them about, and lay the basis for ultimately
winning them to, the full Communist Party program.
It is with this task in mind that new methods of work
have been adopted by the Party as a whole and also
each Party member.

It is therefore, absolutely essential that in regard to
the circulation of our Daily and Sunday Worker that
w-e adopt-

  

A GOOD APPROACH

ERE then is a sample of the correct selling approach
of “Twentieth Century Methods.” There is here

only one immediate goal, that is the sale of the paper,
the Daily Worker and / or the Sunday Worker.

The Approach: “Good morning———I am advertising
the Sunday Worker to my neighbors. As the regular
agent for this weekly newspaper, I am not looking for
yearly subscriptions. But I would like every family to
read it once. The price is ﬁve cents. May I leave you
your copy, sir. I am sure you will like it.”

(Theory of approach is a positive one. You are prac-
tically expecting a sale. ‘When you have said enough,
stop. Get in—get the nickel—get out. Do not oversell.
With this approach in many cases you will have success
immediately, providing you act as if you were expecting
a sale. And yet, do not be surprised when in equally
many cases you get the regular objections which will be
as follows: “I am not interested.” “I don’t read the Com-
munist sheet” or “I read the News and the American,
etc.” But go over the top like this.) *

First Answer to 0b'ection: “I a reciate our oint
I PP Y P

of View sir, because I know the other kind of newspaper

is being read, but as the regular agent for this workers’

paper, I suggest you try it once just because it is dif-

ferent. Read today’s copy. The price is only ﬁve cents.

Try it.” '
(Theory behind answer: First you are agreeing with
customer (which is important in making a sale.) Not-
withstanding the fact that your customer is “not inter-
ested” you are still asking for ﬁve cents, just because it is
different, just because it is a workers’ paper. That is the
curiosity appeal. But your customer‘ is still not sold in
many cases. Then come back strong like this.)

Seond Answer to Objection: “After your family has
read this paper, they will be able to judge for themselves
as to its value. Only workers will support a workers’
paper. Ivam sure you will like it. (Assume the sale.
Hand the paper to him. Watch him reach for his
pocket.)

(Theory behind answer: This customer’s objection has
been very severe, but your answer has been a positive
one. You are still expecting a sale. Why? You have
brought home to the customer the “community interest,”
that is, “only workers will support a workers’ paper.”
You have interjected the digniﬁed sympathy appeal. This
appeal is a strong one. You are suddenly bringing home
to your customer his class interest. This appeal will make
hﬁm dig for a nickel.) If you still have not sold him try
t is——

 

 

F TER a ﬁnal “no”: “Well in that case, I will not

attempt to persuade you now, but, as time goes on,

you may feel dilferently about supporting a workers’
paper. Then I will be your regular agent” (smile).

(Theory: After making such a friendly statement you
will be amazed how often you will receive a friendly reply
from the strongest objector such as “Maybe sometime”
or “You can’t tell,” etc. If it is important to leave an
opening for next week if you make a sale, how much
more important to do so where you have not made a
sale. You know there is an old saying, “The tougher
they are the harder they fall.” And I think it applies
very well in the case of workers who have been blinded
to the need for unity with other workers. Let us remem-
ber then never to let ourselves he the cause of closing the
door on future contact with this worker.)

SOME COMMENTS

Before we stated that we can sell in spite of a person’s
aversion. Yet this will require some answer to the per-
son’s objections. We will explain. Most of all objec-
tions are polite ways of saying the same thing. That is,
they hate a Communist paper. Therefore, some one
positive answer on our part will serve the purpose, no
matter what form their objections may take. We have
agreed that we should never convince them that their
objections are ill-founded. For example, “I am not
intereste .” Shall we prove that you are interested?
“No!” he says, “I wouldn’t read your paper if you gave
it to me.’ Shall I convince him that he will read the
paper? “No.” He says, “I read the News and the Amer-
ican.” Shall I convince him that he shouldn’t? “No.”

Your answer should take this positive form. (You are
good enough to appreciate his point of view because you
“understand the other type of paper is being read.” But
still you are requesting him to read it, in order for him
to read it, in order for him to ﬁnd out why he hates it,
that is, “just because it is different.” And your ﬁnal
positive suggestion, “I am sure you will like it,” maybe
just suﬂicient to get him. In brief you are not clashing
with him at any point, with his views, yet you are being
positive with phrases such as these, “after reading you
will still be able to judge.” “Workers should support
a paper that speaks for them,” etc. . . . In using such
approach and answer to objections, it is natural that
such approach and answers will have to be learned and
understood so that they do not sound stereotyped.

 

HOW TO’ WOR K

THE salesman always bears in mind these facts: He is

brief——three minutes at the most. He always leaves
himself an opening for another approach the following
week. His task is not one of direct ptropagandizing——-
that is the task of his paper. He smiles. Takes his
hat off. I

THREE MINUTES AT THE MOST——YES,
WE REALLY MEAN THIS

Right here we can anticipate an objection from some
well meaning Comrade. That objection will be this:
“But our duty is not simply to sell the paper——we have
to build our Party along with selling, and how can we
do this, if we just act as paper boys taking but three
minutes per customer and prospect?” Well, of course
we must deﬁnitely say that in trying to build the circu-
lation of our Daily and Sunday rWorker we are also even
basically interested in building our Party, recruiting new
members into the Party. But on your ﬁrst contact with
a worker you cannot expect immediate recruitment into
the Party. You may not even succeed in getting him to
subscribe to our paper on the ﬁrst visit, not even speak-
ing about perhaps his not even buying a single copy of
the paper when you ﬁrst call on him. But be sure to

make a friend of the worker. Don’t press too hard be-

cause you may lose him. Lay a basis for a sale on your
next visit.

Therefore when going canvassing we should take only
three minutes at the most to contact each worker and
sell him a paper. On the second visit and even the third
we should still take but three minutes. During this
period of several weeks we will be selling the paper,
gaining the workers’ conﬁdence, and letting the paper
spread Commmnism. During this period you will be
laying the basis for recruiting the worker into the Party
and activizing him in the class struggle. After your
third and fourth sale to a particular worker you should
make a special call on him in regard to the question of
recruiting the worker into the Party and activizing him in
the class struggle. On this visit spend a half an hour
or more if necessary with him. But don’t spend more
than three minutes when you are out on your regular
canvassing for the Daily or Sunday Worker. Build the
paper ﬁrst. Reach more and more workers. Don’t waste
time when canvassing. Be business like. Spend your
time wisely and effectively. And in this way we will
be able to really build both the circulation of the Daily
and Sunday Worker and recruit many more members
into our Party than we are recruiting with our present
methods.

 

COMMENTS BY COMRADE SHAIN WHO
GOT THESE RESULTS

First Sunday :

Let’s say you start with 30 Sunday Workers. As you
canvass house after house, skipping none, you make
records on your cards, which you will use in the future
weeks. You go until you sell them all. Let’s say it took
three hours and you covered two sides of one street.

Second Sunday:

Say you took 35. You cover the same territory as last
week, in the following manner. You saw all of these:
Those who bought it last week, those where no one was
home last week, those that did not buy, but still
seemed to be worth another -try.

It is possible that you will sell only 15 out of the 30
who bought the ﬁrst Sunday. Then you may pick up
another ten from those who were not at home last week,
or those that did not buy last week. This makes only 25.
But you will have found that you used less time because
of certain eliminations. So then, you take the next street.
Let us suppose that you make these ﬁrst time sales (10 in
5 buildings)‘. Now you have 15 repeat buyers and 20
new ones. i

Third Sunday:

Now you take 40. Visit all those in your ﬁrst territory in
regular order, who have bought either once or twice, and
the remainder of those who were not home plus the few
who refused, but still seemed possible. Say your results
are 13-——third time buyers, 5-—second time buyers and
10——ﬁrst time buyers. Now that makes 28, and you will
have time to add a group of new buildings with your 12
papers in order to make a total of 40.

And so you continue week after week, say for eight
weeks. ‘By a process of elimination you get so you are
practically delivering to your original customers, con-
serving time and gradually adding new ones.

4,.‘ '.

In New York City—After you have secured a good
number of steady customers, say ﬁfty, and have sold
them each week for from four to eight weeks, then you
should take steps to see that the route is turned over to
a regular Daily Worker home delivery carrier or a week-
end Sunday Worker home delivery carrier. You should
then go on covering a new territory spreading ever wider
the eﬂ'ect of your most important political work. . M

Outside of New York_ City—After you have sold the
paper for a number of weeks to a particular worker,
you should attempt to secure a subscription to the paper
from the person. This is a most important step, be-
cause it will release you from just delivering another
paper and enable you to extend your work to new
workers. If you do not get the sub, be sure to continue
delivering the paper regularly and try later again to get
a sub from the worker. It is most important that you
constantly work in the direction of securing subscriptions
from all your regular customers. This work must be
viewed as being of the highest type of politically impor-
tant Communist activity.

This gives you a general idea of a selling plan. The
value of it is not in the fact that it is the only one, but
it is a deﬁnite plan to serve as a pattern. One that seems
logical and good enough to try, and therefore, one that
is worth while organizing to put into action.

In conclusion, we say if it is true that Daily and Sun-
day Worker readers are our sympathizers and eventually
will become Party members, then if we, who are press
conscious take as our main and possibly our only Party

task, that one of increasing circulation, we will then’

be bringing our Communist program to a much larger
mass base. And this surely is a Leninist-Stalinist task
worthy of performing.
