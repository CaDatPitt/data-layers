RUSS|A——OUR ALLY !:

half Asia become slim indeed. America, of course, is likely to become an
increasingly valuable ally. But she knows that her production cannot he
stepped up with the necessary rapidity to meet such a situation. And even
if this were possible her distance from the base of operations in Europe
constitutes an almost insuperable handicap to assistance on the scale which
would be necessary even to stand on the defensive against Hitler.

Such an outlook envisages a war of attrition which may well last into
the lives of our children and destroy the civilisation of the world in the
process.

That isn’t what we want, and it isn’t what the people of Britain or
Russia want. We are all prepared to throw ourselves into the task of
making the most tremendous effort of our lives if our governments will
show us that they mean business, if they will take steps that will bring
about the defeat of Hitler in the shortest possible time. There is almost
universal agreement in this aim—to smash Hitlerism as quickly as possible,
the only dissentients being a small handful of irresponsible elements such
as Mr.4Archie Cameron, late Cabinet Minister in the Menzies Government.

WHICH WAY LIES VICTORY?

While the agreement as to aims is almost universal, there is the utmost
confusion as to method. A quite common school of thought believes that
the correct strategy for the’ moment is to sit tight, taking advantage of the
pre-occupation of Hitler on the Russian Front in order to build and re-
equip an army and reserves. Mr. Eden, in the debate in the Commons in
late October, expressed this viewpoint. While emphatically denying that
there was any social prejudice affecting aid to Russia, he said that sixteen
months ago Britain did not have one fully-trained, fully-equipped division
. . . defences were practically non-existent, and our Middle East forces
lacked practically all modern equipment.

Commenting on that speech, Godfrey Blunden, of the Sunday Telegraph,
said: “The Foreign Secretary did not seemiadequate . . . to deal with the
situation. The issues are plain enough. On one side the workers, aware
of the inefficiencies in production, fear that Britain, unable to help Russia,
may be left ﬁnally to face Germany alone.”

In the course of the same debate, Mr. Aneurin Bevan made a speech
which put the matter in a nutshell: “What the country is asking is this:

 

i

RUSSIA-—"OUR ALLY !
If an ally with 190 million people comes unexpectedly into the ﬁeld, and
if the pre-occupation of Germany with Russia doesn’t afford an opportuntiy
of hitting the Germans in a vital spot, what is the strategy of winning the
war?”

H|TLER'S STRATEGY

The Nazis, as is well known, have a predetermined strategy by means
of which they are attempting to gain world domination. That strategy is
based on the military theory of dealing with one opponent at a time. First
Austria, then Czechoslovakia, then Poland, Norway, Holland, Belgium,
France, Rumania, Jugoslavia, and Greece, in that order. Now it is Russia.
Next on the list is Britain. More than anything else the German military
staff fear a war on two or more fronts. It is to the compulsion of having
to conduct a war on several fronts during 1914-18 that they attributed the
German defeat on that occasion.

It was with this fear in mind that they sent Hess to Britain in May
of this year. The object of his mission, it has been revealed, was to per-
suade the British Government to conclude a peace with Germany so that
the Nazis might conduct their war against the Soviet Union without. the
fear of a stab in the back. The-Nazis feared that Britain might seize the
opportunity of their pre-occupation in Russia to attack in the West, and did
all in their power to prevent this.

WE WANT A WESTERN FRONT

Now we learn that they have apparently ceased to fear the possibility
of such an attack. There can be no other explanation for the announce-
ment that recently all ﬁrst class ﬁghting personnel, equipment of every
kind including tanks and planes, had been withdrawn from the occupied
countries to strengthen the offensive in the East. All that is left in occu-
pied France is a handful of divisions of third-rate personnel acting as a
police force. Should patriotic British people be prepared to sit back in
face of that gesture of contempt? Or are we to-believe that the mission
of Hess succeeded after all?

British people, Australians and Canadians, are not prepared to accept
such an answer. In the words of Sir Arnold Gridley, British Conservative

RUS$|A——OUR ALLY !

M.F.: “Something very serious is happening in England. It would be folly
to ignore the fact. There’s a growing sense of uneasiness throughout the
country. The public wants to know whether the Government is doing all
it should; whether production is what it should be; and whether com
placency is too widely felt.” Gridley is, according to Godfrey Blunden, an
inﬂuential member of the Conservative Party which Churchill leads.

BRITISH STRATEGY

British military leaders have always known that the only way to defeat
Hitler is to defeat him militarily on the continent of Europe. The blockade,
bombing of cities and military objectives, naval power, and suchthings are
only minor auxiliaries to this end, necessary, of course, but not by them-
selves, decisive. Alone, and without military action, they cannot succeed.
Hitler can only finally be defeated on the land. Until Russia came into
the war, the prospect of such a defeat was remote indeed. While political
leaders never permitted themselves to doubt that ultimate success would
be ours, the estimates of the time which would be necessary to achieve
victory gradually receded into the dimmest distance. Early in the war the
general estimate was two years or so. It later become ten years, and even-
tually one authority placed it as a generation away. Such success would
have been a Pyrrhic victory, even if it could have been ﬁnally attained.
In the interim everything we value would have been destroyed and civili-
sation might have relapsed into universal poverty and barbarism.

But now a miracle has happened. Without the slightest effort on our
part—we might even say, in spite of our efforts—we have gained an ally of
first-class military strength. Only the Red Army could have been com-
pared, either in numbers or equipment with the German army. And not
only is it a large and well-equipped army, but it has a ﬁghting morale
second to none, as its heroic resistance to the Nazi murderers has shown.

So powerful has that resistance been that Hitler has been compelled to
withdraw his troops from the countries which he previously enslaved.
l‘{inety per cent. of his efiectives, practically all of his tanks and ﬁrst-line
planes are at death grips with the Red Army‘. Only one-tenth remains to
police the whole of conquered and subject Europe, extending from Norway
in the north, through France, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy, Bulgaria,
Rumania, Jugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Greece.

OUR SECRET ALLIES

And from those conquered nations comes mighty evidence of hostility’
amongst the enslaved peoples——assassinations here, guerilla warfare there,
and a current of sabotage of all effort intended to assist Nazi plans from
every part of the Continent, not even excepting Nazi Germany itself.

Here then is the opportunity which even in our most hopeful moments,
we never thought possible. The Nazi military machine is held in a vice-like
grip in Eastern Europe, unable to spare a plane, a tank, or a man. The
people of Europe are literally crying out to us to invade their countries,
to give them arms to ﬁght their oppressors, to become a vast horde of allies
with a morale which grows on the possession of something to ﬁght for,
liberation from tyranny. Never again may that opportunity occur. Never
again may we have the opportunity of ﬁghting Hitler on such terms, terms
which neither he nor we anticipated. Never again may we have the chance
to show Hess in terms of action what we think of him. Never again may
the Nazis be so relatively weak.

We must act now, or we may never be in the position to act again with
such overwhelming advantages. True, it may be that Britain has not
completed ‘her rearmament, that much remains to he done before our forces
will be on an equal footing with the enemy——if we had to meet him on
equal terms. But we do not have to meet him on equal terms. Any
withdrawal of forces he may make from the Eastern front may result in
unequivocal defeat for him——and he knows it. His attack on Russia was

the throw of a gambler. It is all or nothing. He gambles on British inac-e

tivity. Let us disappoint him.

Tom SECOND’ BATTLE FRONT

We must not heed excuses such as the fear of another Dunkirk. Hitler
is not in the same position to-day as he was then, and the British army is
immeasurably stronger. The answer to such pleas is given by Frank Owen,
editor of Lord Beaverbrook’s “Evening Standard.”

"It is impossible,” he says, “for Germany to invade England at the
moment. We should send our great army to form a second from. It is all
right for the War Minister to say we cannot risk another invasion, but

5

IUSS|A——OUR ALLY !

there is one gigantic evacution we must never lose sight of——the dreadful‘

possibility that mighty Russia won’t continue to ﬁght unless we bestir
ourselves. That would be a Dunkirk of world dimensions.”

THE HOME FRONT

What action can the Australian people take to enable Britain to open
battle fronts? Wherever the Allies operate they must be assured of a
constant stream of equipment and supplies. We want them to be as well
and better equipped than any forces Hitler can throw against them.

Therefore, the insistent, the urgent demand of the moment is for
a war effort of enormous proportions, greater than anything we previously
thought possible. Australian production of war materials can be doubled,
perhaps trebled. That is our programme. It is a programme which will
have the enthusiastic support of the vast majority of Australians. And it
is a programme which can consolidate national unity around the State and
Federal Governments. Those Governments have a unique opportunity.
Already the Federal Labor Government seems to be acutely aware of the
national mood. All sections have applauded its prompt action against the
wealthy steamship company, Huddart Parker Ltd., whose directorsappeared

to be more concerned with maintaining their proﬁts than with the urgent .

needs of Australian defence.

An accelerated war effort does not mean speed-up, or the increase
in the length of the working day. The English Labor Minister,'Mr. Bevin,
has told the world of his discovery that the inordinately long working day
decreases efficiency and leads to increased absenteeism.

STEP UP PRODUCTION

Production can be increased by quite different methods. Planning and
co-ordination of effort, things which have been conspicuously absent during
the past two years, are vital factors if we are to eliminate hold-ups and
bottlenecks. The “cost-plus” system which permits defence contractors to
charge the Government the cost of their contracts plus a ﬁxed rate of proﬁt
has proved an altogether too great temptation to hungry war proﬁteers.
These bright 1.15 were only too quick to grasp the possibilities of the
situation-—the more costly and wasteful their production, the more proﬁt

1!

 

RUSS|A——OU*R ALLY !

to themselves. “Cost-plus” must go. Obstruction or sabotage by con-
tractors and manufacturers must be dealt with in the same way as Federal
Labor dealt with the sabotage of the shipowners.

Since the outbreak of war there have been many strikes in vital war
industries which have resulted in appreciable loss, not only to the men in
the way of wages, but to Australia and the anti-Nazi cause generally in the
form of urgently needed equipment. All patriotic Australians, not excluding
the strikers. have deplored that loss.

Unfortunately, far too many critics have offered the worst possible
solution to the problem of overcoming strikes, the application in demo-
cratic Australia of near-fascist regulations restricting the liberty of working
men. The natural response of self-respecting working men to such a solu-
tion is deepened antagonism with passive or active resistance. The stick-
’em-up-against-a-wall advocates solve no problems. They only create new
ones.

HOW TO END STRIKES

State 7Labo_r has never welcomed strikes. We deplore them, particu-
larly at a time of national emergency such as the present. And we there-
{are demand ﬁrstly that conciliation be made really effective, and secondly
that all objectionable conditions which have latent in-them the seeds of
future strikes be instantly remedied. This is quite the reverse of advocat-
ing the banning of strikes, which are the only means the workers possess
of calling public attention to their grievances when every other method
has failed.

While we call on the workers to dispense, as far as possible, with strikes
in the interests of increased production, we believe that this must not be the
occasion of lowered standards or loss of civil rights. Australia is still in
the almost unique position of being able to provide the whole of its people
with their food, clothing, and shelter requirements. Foodstuffs are, in
fact, more profuse in Adstralia at present than ever before owing to the
shipping position. We must see that our surplus of food is placed within
reach of the pockets of all Australians, that none should go hungry.

It is entirely reasonable to suggest that only the best is good enough
for Australians who are to make their do-or-die effort to provide the sinews

13

  

RUSSIA——OUR ALLY !

of war. The scandal of increasing prices must be ended. The prices of
all commodities essential to the ordinary worker and his family must be
pegged, and the wages of worker or soldier must be sufficient to enable
him to buy those necessities.

STOP LUXURY PRODUCTION!

On the other hand, the production of expensive luxury goods not
essential at the present time must be drastically curtailed or even eliminated.
The labor power used in luxury production at the present time can be
more usefully employed in defence industry. Such a change would hardly
affect the standards of the majority of people; luxuries are out of their
reach, anyhow. And most of the people whose incomes are large enough
to bring luxuries within their reach will not cavil at the proposition that
their futures are bound up with the general war effort. They will agree
that selﬁshness now is shertsightedness.

Most people will agree that everything, every private or sectional issue,
is secondary to the question of production. That production must consist
of the equipment we want, in the correct proportions. The tendency to
produce a superabundance of some kinds of equipment whilst neglecting
others equally urgent, because it is more proﬁtable to produce the first
kind, must be eliminated.

All this means‘ that we must make some really effective adjustments
to our industrial machinery and to be so determined about it that we will
brook no denial by private interests. It can be done, as it is being done
to an ever increasing extent in England to-day. The factory and workshop
committees are the bodies which in England led the tremendous blitz
which has taken place to step-up the production of aeroplanes, tanks, and
guns. Stories of their triumphs ﬁll the press. They are officially recog-
nised and are strengthened with representation from clerical and managerial
staffs. The people who know the problems of production are the people
who can and will solve them.

BUILD THE SHOP COMMITTEES

We have our shop committees in Australia, too. They can do what
their comrades in England have done and are doing now-~—and without the
handicap of a war on their front doorstep. Give the Australian shop com-

14

 

RUSSIA-—OUlt Aux:

mittees official recognition, encourage them to build their organisation, in
consultation and co-operation with the factory and workshop staffs. The
real production experts, the men who are doing the job, the ﬁtters and the
turners, the engineers and the ironworkers; these men can make our war
effort speed at tremendous tempo if we give them our conﬁdence. Let us
make our slogan: “All strength to the shop committees.”

Our Party’s proposals can be stated briefly as follows:——

1. That the various bodies now controlling the war effort be reconsti-
tuted to give direct representation to the trade unions. Where private
interests are engaged in war production, their representatives must not be
in control of the Boards. The workers to have a measure of control of
industry which would ensure maximum production, workshop committees
to have access to company records and a voice in the engagement and
dismissal of workers and other problems of factory management.

2. An investigation into the activities of the monopolies with a view
to’ controlling those activitiesin the interests of the Australian people

3. An improvement in price control machinery, the restriction of proﬁts,
and the maintenance of living standards.

4. Freedom of organisation, speech, press, and assembly for every
section of the Labor Movement.

5. The development of full diplomatic and trading relations between
Australia and the Soviet Union, Australian representatives to be sent to
Soviet Russia with the object of discussing, together with the British repre-
sentatives, problems of Anglo-Australian-Soviet mutual assistance and
diplomatic representation.

AUSTRALIANS WANT NATIONAL UNITY

These proposals are of a reasonable nature and obviously calculated
to achieve what most Australians desire above everything else at the present
time-—~real national unity and arising therefrom rapidly increasing produc-
tion. The N.S.W. Labor Party did not originate these proposals. They
were formulated by the leaders of the great majority of men engaged in
the production of armaments in Australia. . These leaders can justifiably

world, are solvi

claim a wider experience of the needs of the men and women they repre-
sent than any other individual or group of individuals.

There can he no reason to doubt their claims that they alone can
organise our production on an immense scale, providing they can go to
the workers they represent and explain to them that they have been given
the means of ending all the contentious and harassing conditions which
have previously brought many of those men out on strike. If those leaders
are placed in the position of showing their workers that they have a stake
in Australia really‘ worth working and fighting to the death for, then we,
the free and democratic people of Australia will be able to play a part
in the defeat of Hitlerism which will be comparable with the effort of any
country in the world to-day.

.The Russian people to-day are the front line ﬁghters for the free
peoples of all countries. Their scorched earth is soaked with the blood of
their own grim defenders. They must be victorious, but we must share
their victory. Let us open new fronts" against Hitler. And let us build up

at home such a solid front of resistance a'nd*"iiroduction that we cannot

FOREWORD

The heroic stand by our gallant Soviet Ally must inspire all sections
of the community. As the murderous Fascist hordes «batter the great
Socialist construction of the Soviet Union, the hearts of all true democrats,
lovers of freedom, of progress and civilisation, _are sad and embittered, and
moved with stem determination to aid this great Ally. The self-sacriﬁce
of the soldiers and citizens, workers and peasants, must arouse all in an
attempt to rally our forces to assist these people to wage our battle against
the brutality of Hitler’s inhuman brutes. Our first line of defence is in
the Soviet Union. Our first line"of offence is in the Soviet Union. All we
stand to achieve, all we have"t'o defend, is dependent upon the outcome
of this great struggle.  ' '

We must do all we can to assist in the destruction of the Fascist
menace. This can be done by opening a second front, by extending ALL
aid to the Soviet Union.

In this little pamphlet, published on the anniversary of the Russian
revolution, Albert Keesing, chairman of the Education Committee of the
Australian Labor Party, State of New South Wales, has concisely reviewed
our immediate tasks.

We want a second front against Hitler Fascism.

We want National Unity for a better war against this destructive
menace.

We want greater production so that we can assist our Soviet Ally
immediately. '

General Secretary,

Australian Labor Party, State of N.S.W.

Russia our Ally!

On June 22 of this year, Soviet Russia was savagely attacked by Hitler,
and as a result became by far the most powerful ally of the British peoples
throughout the world. Not the British people alone, however, have their
eyes ﬁxed on the Eastern Front. The result of that battle will decide
whether the free peoples of the world will retain their democratic rights or
whether their historic struggles will have been in vain. It will also decide
the destiny of the enslaved peoples of Europe and China.

The hopes and aspirations of 900 million people are in the balance.
Are those hundreds of millions of people tube free to live as human beings
in a world of progress, or are they and we td become slaves to monsters like
Hitler and Goering? The anti-Fascist peoples of the whole world answer
with the deﬁant shout: "They shall not pass!” The Englishman and the
Russian, the American and the Chinese, the Australian and the Dutch are
united as never before in grim determination to destroy Fascism wherever
it rears its ugly head.

WE FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY

In his speech soon after the invasion began, Stalin said: “This is a
war of the whole nation against Fascist Germany. It will help all the
enslaved peoples of Europe. We shall not be alone. We shall have the
help of all the nations of Europe and America, and also of the Germans.
We are ﬁghting for democratic freedom. It is a union of nations against
the enslavement of Fascism. The speech of the Prime Minister of England
and the aid of the United States will arouse in the hearts of the Russian
Ieople nothing but gratitude.”

And we reply to Stalin and the Russian people that their magniﬁcent
defence of civilisation and progress, including our own, arouses gratitude

?

and relief in our own hearts. One of Lord Beaverbrook's papers said that
before Hitler turned east we were facing the worst three months in our
history. Whether that situation will be repeated and ﬁnd Britain in a situ-
ation relatively even worse than last June will depend on ourselves alone.
But it must not happen. For the moment, while Hitler’s armies are sprawled
across the enormous Russian front, with only a thin line of boys and old
men policing the countries of conquered Europe, we ﬁnd ourselves in a
position of strategic advantage not equalled since the war began.

A NEW CIVILISATION

What of Russia? Hereis a country where mighty efforts have been
made for twenty years to build a new civilisation on the shattered ruins
left by the Great War and the civil wars which followed upon it. The
achievements of those two decades were unprecedented. From 98 per cent.
illiteracy in 1917 to complete literacy and the biggest university population
in the world, from the oil lamp in 1917 to the mighty hydro-electric power
station and dam of Dniepro§l’.etrovsk=, from a semi-feudal country with a
backward peasant. people to the second greatest industrial country in the
world—next to the U.S.A.—such were the achievements of twenty years of
national effort. R '“ i’ if ' 4 ‘

Almost miraculous as that progress was in some aspects, it could have
been far greater still. But the Soviet leaders knew that they would not be
permitted to pursue their remarkable experiments in the peace they so
ardently desired. Watching the growth of the Nazi Partyearly after the
last war and the seizing of power in 1933, they recognised the force that
sooner or later would attempt the destruction of their new world. And
so they silently prepared. Ever larger portions of the national income
began to be devoted to defence, to forestalling Hitler and his friends.

A NEW STRATEGY

And at the same time Russian military leaders studied and worked out
the strategy and tactics to be employed against Hitler No steel and con-
crete defence line on whose strength the safety ofutheir country would
depend, answered their needs. The answer to blitzkrieg is possible only with
the use of the same weapons as the aggressors. The now famous‘ strategy of

RUSSIA-—.OUR ALLY I

defence in depth called for tremendous sacriﬁces, for the sacriﬁce of ancient
cities and the destruction of such achievements as Dnieprostroi, which had
become monuments of the Revolution and the pride of every Russian; but
that strategy, with our co-operation, will lead to the effacement of the blot
of Fascism from the record of human progress. Every objective reached
by the Reichswehr has been attained only at the cost of irreplaceable man-
power and military equipment.

But despite the enormous losses sustained by the German war
machine, it continues to advance. Some of the areas it has invested include
natural resources of vital importance such as iron and steel, and now the
Caucasian oil wells are directly threatened. While we may eulogise the
Red Army and its strategy, we cannot fail to recognise that the continuation
of its resistance on the present scale depends on a constant and enormous
ﬂow of equipment of all kinds; and many of Russia’s arsenals have been
destroyed. The people of the world must see that this breach is uuequately
ﬁlled.

. sascokcnsn EARTH

Characteristic of the foresight of the Russian ’Government is the
news which we have been receiving of the steps taken to transfer large
and ‘important units of industry thousands of miles behind the front.
"Leapfrogging,” Stalin calls it. If half of European Russia falls before Hitler,
then the Urals and the vast hinterland of Siberia shall be the new military
base of the Red Army. No matter where Hitler may advance, nothing
awaits him but scorched earth and ruined cities. Where industrial enter-
prise cannot be transferred to safety it is destroyed. Not even behind his

lines is the Nazi safe. Here organised guerilla warfare on a gigantic scale, a

plays havoc with his communications. Peaceful farmers and peasants have
left the plough and taken up the sword, working in collaboration with
special army units deliberately left behind to harass the German rear.

In spite of the losses which they have suffered in men and territory
and cities and industry, the morale and conﬁdence of the Russian people
remain unimpaired. They ﬁght for a faith. "We shall not again be
enslaved,” said ﬁalin. They know that the issue at stake is progress or
barbarism, whether they and the rest of humanity shall continue to go
forward or relapse into the dark ages. And they know that they have the

support of all progressive people of the world, including those inside Ger-
many. With these aims and allies they are supremely conﬁdent of ultimate
victory and are prepared for unlimited sacriﬁces to attain it.

MAKE HITLER MISS THE BUS

In our own interests, in the interests of our children, we must see to
it that those sacriﬁces shall not be wasted, that Russian conﬁdence in us
will be deserved. London, Coventry, Bristol, Liverpool, have given us a
foretaste of what Hitler has in store for us should his Russian plans suc-
ceed. Our job is to see that this time Hitler really does miss. the bus!

We now celebrate the 24th anniversary of the Russian revolution; deep
down in the hearts of all democrats we also celebrate the courage and
strength, the grim determination of the Soviet people to ﬁght on to victory.
So far they have accomplished a feat thought to be impossible. They are
maintaining resistance to the Reichswehr for a period of time and on a scale
which we ourselves could not envisage for years. No other ally had proved
capable of resisting the full might of the German army for more than a
few days. Previously, heroic resistances have led to heroic evacuations.
But today not even those least informed of all people, the military experts,
doubt the capacity of the Red Army or the Russian people.

RUSSIAN EFFICIENCY

No longer is the splendid efficiency of Soviet industry, the remarkable
morale of the Russian people, the superb courage of the Red Army open
to doubt. About these things no argument is possible. The facts of a ﬁve
months of unprecedented battles on the Eastern Front, battles in which
Hitler has lost more than a ‘third of his manpower effectives and incalcu-
lable amounts of material and equipment, these facts speak for themselves.

Plainly, our politicians were lamentably misinformed or uninformed
on these most vital questions. True, they had the same and better avenues
of information than the small bodies of students who, in each of the western
countries kept up a difficult struggle against the obstacles of official regu-
lations and inadequate means, in order to spread knowledge of the true
facts about Soviet Russia. For the most part the detractors of Russia con-
sisted of people who had good reasons for not wanting the real truth to

 

RUSS|A——OUR ALLY !

become public property It is not the purpose of this pamphlet to resurrect
old grievances or renew old distrusts.

But we cannot avoid mentioning the obvious errors of policy made in
the past by people who were paid to have known better, because we are
interested to see that a repetition of similar mistakes is avoided now and in
the future. Plainly, it is in the interests not only of the British and
American peoples but of the peoples of every part of the world that any
lingering anti-Soviet prejudices should be cleared away at once if we are
to prosecute the war against Hitlerism in a manner that will ensure victory
in the shortest possible time. A lurking prejudice in the mind of a Prime
Minister or an Army Chief, a groundless suspicion entertained by a section
of the people, may have the effect of needlessly prolonging the agony and
slaughter of this most terrible of all wars.

WHAT DOES RUSSIA THINK?

In mid-September, former Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Maxim
Litvinov, made a statement which was published in the press of the world.
Litvinov it was who for seven years fought brilliantly but unsuccessfully
to establish the peace front of collective security against which the ambi-
tions of Hitler aggression might have been shattered and broken. What
he was unable to achieve in seven years of effort prior to the war, we
believe he and we will succeed in building after two years of the most
devastating war in human history.

He said: “This isn_’t a question of giving or lending the Soviets any-
thing, or helping the Soviet front. It is a question of strengthening one's
own front, the common front, the Allies’ front of humanity. It is a question
of a common cause in which all people are interested no less than the
Soviets, and to which the Soviets have already made an invaluable contri-
bution in rivers of blood shed by hundreds of thousands of their finest
sons. The whole world realises that the ‘issue of this struggle will decide

the fate of all countries, not only in Europe, but in other continents as
well.”

As if his point needed strengthening by Nazi conﬁrmation, the official
Nazi organ, “Voelkischer Beobachter,” recently said: "On the issue of the
battle in the East depends the existence or annihilation of Germany.”

RUSS|A——OUR ALLY !

WE DEPEND ON THE RED ARMY

No responsible person to-day will disagree either with Litvinov or the
official Nazi press that the vital and decisive front for humanity at the
present time is the Soviet Front. Whether the free peoples of the world
shall survive in their freedom, whether the oppressed peoples shall be
liberated or their chains perpstuated——these decisions are dependent
almost entirely on the events in Finland, Russia, the Ukraine. If the Soviet
Union falls, if the amazingly heroic resistance of the Soviet peoples should
be of no avail, if Hitler should succeed or partly succeed in his efforts to
smash the resistance of the other most powerful military force in the world,
then the world will be darkened for years to come by the black cloud of

Nazism.

To-day the whole of continental Europe is Hitler’s stamping ground.

From it he draws enormous tribute; it provides him with the food to

To answer this question, we must see the picture of Britain isolated in
