 

WINNIPEG, Manitoba-
Canadian Mine-Mill Vice-
President William Kennedy
announced here May 10
that application for certifi-
cation on behalf of all eligible

employees of the International
Nickel Company at Thompson
Lake has been made to the
Manitoba Labor Board by Lo-
cal 1026 of the Thompson &
District Mine, Mill, Smelter

- and Refinery Workers’ Union.

Kennedy, who headed up

. the hard-hitting organizing

campaign which resulted in a
clean sweep for Mine-Mill, said
automatic processing was ex-
pected of the application by
the new local to become bar-
gaining agent for all eligible
employees at the huge new
INCO property.

Local 1026 was chartered by
Mine-Mill early in May follow-
ing the final phase of an in-
tensive organizational
paign planned many months
ago and put into full operation
last December. Canadian Na-
tional President Ken A. Smith

cam-

presented the local union char-
ter at a membershipmeeting
ceremony, climaxing a. suc-
cessful drive in which all eli-
gible Thompson workers were
signed up as dues-paying mem-
bers of Mine-Mill. _

LOCATED deep in the
northern frontier of Manitoba,
400 air miles from Winnipeg,
INCO’s major nickel produc-
ing Thompson project in-
cludes the three-phase process
of mining, smelting and;refin-
ing. — A -.
In full operation within the

next couple of years it will
employ inore than 2,000 work-
ers in the mines and surface
plants. Already under develop-
ment is _a townsite to eventual-

ly accomodate 8,000 people.

The new mining area, ex-
pected to play an important
role in the industrial and pop-
ulation development of north-
ern Manitoba, is 950 miles
from the'INCO operations in
the Sudbury, Ont., district
where Mine-Mill Local 598
holds bargaining rights.

Steel Raid
Defeated at
Pend Oreille

METALLINE FALLS,
Wash.-A United Steelworkers
raid on the Pend Oreille Mines
unit of Mine-Mill Local 515
was defeated here in an

  

' NLRB election May 10.

Efforts of 7 fulltime Steel
organizers to blitz the prop-
erty with red-baiting, booze,
money and other skulldug-
gery failed when the workers

9 voted 77 to 62 to keep Mine-

Mill as their bargaining agent.
Pen Oreille, owned by the
Bunker. Hill company, has been
operating under an extension
’ agreement in negotiations with
Local 515 since last July. Con-
tract issues are identical with
.those at Bunker Hill’s Coeur
d’Alenes operations which
were struck by Mine-Mill Lo-
cal 18 May 5.
With the company having
‘to stockpile production here,

 ‘ both the rumors that it would

probably cease operations and
its Stooge-inspired Steel raid
were coupled as a move to
undermine the Coeur d’Alenes
strike. The move flopped.

highly praised the work of the
Mine-Mill team which launch-
ed the campaign and carried
it out. National President
Smith and Mike Solski of L0-
cal 598 were members of the
original committee which initi-
ated the drive. Staff officer
Nels Thibault contributed im-
portantly in coordinating work
on the campaign. Much of the
success achieved was also at-
tributed to the hard-day-to-day
work of national organizers
Pete Mongean and Bill Hun-
chuk. -

, At the same time, Kennedy
emphasized that what made
the campaign’s success abso-
lute was the; ’fact that the

‘workers at the new IN CO

property were determined to
be part of the Mine-Mill union

brothers in Sudbury, Port Col--

The Utah-Nevada leadership

Local 18 Strike Action  
Closes Bunker Hill 

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

KELLOGG, Ida.—Some 1,700 members of Mine-
Mill Local 18 hit the bricks here May 5 in a strike which
completely shut down Bunker Hill company operations

at Kellogg.

The workers were forced to halt production after al-

most 100 days of meetings,
just one day short of a year
since negotiations began May
6, 1959, failed to gain com-
pany agreement on workable
grievance and safety proce-
dures, hours of work, work
schedules, overtime pay guar-
antees, job definitions, job bid-
ding procedure and a seniority
clause.

Bitter experience during the
term of the old agreement
which expired June 30, 1959,
resulted in a determination of
Bunker Hill employees to
strengthen their contract cov-
ering those key issues.

For months of bargaining
the union had insisted on a 2-
year package increase.-.t_9.ta1-
ing 22.5 cents per hour includ-
ing 8 cents across the board
retroactive to July 1, 1959,

“another 8 cents effective July

1, 1960, plus 6.5 cents toward
improvement of health and
welfare coverage and other
fringes. '

Bunker Hill's
Profits Show

Bunker Hill made a
net profit after taxes of
$490,813 in the first three
months of 1960, and
$499,314 in the last three
months of 1959. These
are the highest profits
the company has earned
since the first six months
of 1957.

Bunker Hill profits for
the -full year, 1960, not
allowing for the strike,
should run close to the
$3,001,322 made in 1956,
when lead was selling
for over 16 cents and
zinc averaged about 131/;
cents.

The company’s ability
to earn comparable prof-
its with lead and zinc
selling for less than in '
1956 is a result of the
labor-saving and mech-
anization programs un-
dertaken in the last three
years.

Sues Wildcat
Local Leader

LOS ANGELES, Cal.~—A
suit demanding $1.5 million
damages was brought in Su-
perior Court here April 16 by
the United Steelworkers of
America against one of its
own local union officers for
calling an unauthorized strike.

According to the Los Ange-
les Times, the complaint is by
Charles J. Smith, director of
the Steel union’s western Dis-
trict 38, against Anthony J.
Guzzo, local president at
Southwest Steel Rolling Mills
when the wildcat strike was
called. The complaint said
Guzzo called the walkout, al-
legedly over safety conditions,
without being granted author-
ity by top Steel union officials.

The union itself demanded
in the petition that Guzzo
cough up $500,000 for legal
and other expenses in connec-
tion with the strike plus an-
other $500,000 as punitive

' damages.

the many needs and financial obligations which arose during the AA

A lengthy battle depleted the International strike fund.

Although many contributions from U. S. and Canadian
Mine-Mill locals and from other international unions were re-»

Prepares for Bargammg
TORRINGTON, Conn.—Preparations for bargain-
ing with American Brass company under the wage
reopening clause of their two-year contracts were made
here by members of Mine-Mill’s American Brass council

at its meeting April 23.

Delegates attending from
Locals 423 and 445 in Tor-

V EMPHASIS to the bargain-
ing deliberations was added by
the participation of Interna-
tional Vice - Presidents Asbury
Howard and ‘Al Skinner, Secre-
tary-Treasurer Irving Dichter
and District 6 Board Member
Al Petit-Clair.

With the pension plan agree-
ments at all three properties
expiring simultaneously on
June 30, both wages and pen-
sions occupied the main atten-
tion of the meeting in drawing
up f o r m a l bargaining de-
mands.- The need for health
and w elf a r e improvements
was also pointed up.

Negotiations with the com-
pany were scheduled to begin
in Torrington on May 26. Ne-

ON MONEY, the council
projected the demand for a
“substantial general Wage in-
crease for each and every em-
ployee and on all‘ jobs and
classifications equally within
the rate structure.” An addi-
tional increase is being de-

manded for the skilled trades V

and custodial -occupations.
Proposals for pension plan
improvements cover sections
in the agreement on continu-
ous service, normal and early

retirement, permanent and to? I

tal disability, plus a new sec-
tion on vesting. .
Additional changes were al-
so proposed on joint adminis-
trative procedure on the plan
as well as" regarding insurance

benefits for pensioners cover- _

ing life policies and eligibility
for medical and hospitalization
benefits.

While the delegates reported
layoffs and short work-weeks,
confidence was expressed in
the fact that some pickup can
be anticipated when brass mill
customers’ inventories are
worked down. It was also no-
ted that Anaconda, of which
ABC is a wholly-owned subsid-
iary, is on its way to the sec-
ond highest profit year, and
that the company is well able
to meet the wage and pension
demands of its workers.

HE AMERICAN Smelting and Refin-
ing Company owns 55 houses in the
town of Hayden, Arizona. They were built
many years ago, but have always been
well-kept and are palaces compared to

smeltermen are forced to
live in. Not once since these
houses have ‘been ‘built has
the company ?'seen fit to
rent one to a Mexican-
American smelterman.
This has been and is
company policy in spite of
the fact that the over-
whelming majority of work-
ers at the smelter are Mex-
ican-American. This form
of discrimination is an ugly
throw-back to the days when the Mexican-
American workers were hired for the toughest
and lowest-paying jobs in the mines and smel-
ters. This is a reminder of the days when the
mining and smelting companies in the South-
west maintained a Mexican-American wage

, scale lower than that paid any other group of

workers for similar. jobs.

HE HOUSES owned by the American Smelt-

ing and Refining company rent for $23.00 a
month, including water. Any shack a smelter-
man tries to rent in Hayden—no matter its
condition—-rents for more money than that. A
two-room shack with an outside toilet goes for
$35.00 a month. A three or four-room bungalow
with an inside toilet rents for anywhere be-
tween $65.00 and $85.00 a month.

Our local union in Hayden is determined to
end this form of discrimination. A, few weeks
ago the president of our local, James Hanley,
the vice president, Candido Varela, and the
recording secretary, Celestino Torres, filed ap-
plications for three empty company houses.

Their applications astonished the local man-
agement. They were told there was a long. list
of applicants before them——this in spite of_the

_ fact that the houses were empty for some time "T

prior to their applications.
‘k at ‘k

ANLEY, Varela, and Torres waited a few

’ weeks to see if the company would act on
their applications. When no word, came from
the company, they filed a ‘grievance under the
union contract. The company has_n’t a leg to
stand on, morally, contractually, or any other
way. Our agreement with them states: ’

’ “The parties hereto agree that,
there shall be no discrimination, co-
ercion, or intimidation of employees
because of their union and non-union
affiliation, or race, creed, or national
origin . . .”

The Hayden membership. can count on the
support of the membership of the entire Inter-
national Union in this fight. In many South-
west mining and smelting communities the
union together with the community has already
eliminated this ugly form of discrimination.

, It’s time it was ended in Hayden. ' ‘

OMEN are wonderful. I: was reminded '

of this in a conversation in «Washington
recently with the political action director of the
largest International Union in the’ country. He
informed me that his union insists that their
members and representatives ‘bring their wives
to every _political action conference or meeting
called by the organization. He remarked “one
woman is worth two of our members in polit-
ical work.”

I have noticed _a _lack of women—wives of

our members-at any of our recent political,

action meetings. It’s time they were brought
in. Our union can at least double its strength
by including our wives in all of our political
and trade union work.

‘The International Union’s political action

'0 ~., program is just getting off the ground. If our

members and local leaders realized how impor-
tant and influential we can be determining the
complexion of the next Congress and numerous
state governments, it might be an incentive to
them to get going. T  A

Our membership ranges over 25 states. This
year they are going to help elect 68 Congress-
men, 14 Senators, 11 Governors, and 12 State

Legislatures. This is enough }to make a real.

Unemploymenfln  
U.S. Brass Industry

Layoffs and short work weeks are hitting hard at
brass mills from coast to coast. .
_ Since the middle of March 130 workerswith senior-
ity up to 18 years, have been laid off at American Brass
in Buffalo, N. Y._, and only a dozen have been recalled.
Until recently the plant had been on four-day weeks. In the
brass valley in Connecticut over 1,000 workers have been laid
off at one time or another this spring. ' 
 THE MAJOR brass mills in the valley, Chase, Scovill, and
American Brass are working 24 and 32-hour weeks. Chase and
other plants have been working on the “stagger” system, where
laid-off workers are recalled and others laid off in turn. The
Waterbury Chamber of Commerce in mid-May _estimated em-
ployment at local plants varying from 30 per cent to 60 per cent
below normal.
New orders booked by brass and wire mills since last
December have run lower than in any consecutive six-month
period in over ten years. As this is written, late_in May, there

‘ is‘ no sign as yet, of, ‘a "turn for the better.’ ‘Thei financial and
‘trade’ papers reflectxan atmosphere of gloom in the industry-
.wi_th hopes now centered on a pick-up in business some time in

‘ the summer. ' ' ‘

.77‘ '

I

During the strike’  the copper industry, brass‘ mill cus-

I tpomers were placing; sizable orders and building up their inven-
' ‘tories. With the settlement of the, strikes, beginning early last
‘December, these same,,customers started systematically to cut

their orders and shave their inventories of brass imill products.
A ‘continually rising volume of imports adds fuel ‘tothis crisis.
.' =1: >l¢ 01!

WE FIND now that roughly one-tenth of the American
market" for brass is ,lost to foreign competition, while the tight
money and budget balancing policies of the Eisenhower admin-
istration have held back auto production, housing starts, public

works and other irnpbrtant outlets for the brass industry.

On top of this,’ ‘the brass worker has been'-- hit hard by

 speedup, automation, and cost-cutting programs. Output per
- man-hour in brass has increased more sharply in: -recent years

than even in the _’ steel industry. Employment in the brass
industry has declined by more than 10,000 jobs" since World
War II—almost one job out of every four. V -~ = ;
 , The industry ‘has’ given little thought to the effects of its
short-sighted pricing policies on copper and brass consumers.
Many users of copper and brass have shifted to other metals,
or to plastics because of these policies.
>1! =1! 9}‘

THE LATEST I.-example of shortsighted, profit-grabbing

-foolishness in the pricing field is the price increase on tube _and

wire initiated last month in the middle of the worst slump in

years by Bridgeport Brass, and followed by-Phelps Dodge and
Lewin-Mathes. The ‘price increase took the form of discontinua-
tion of 2% and 5 per cent quantity discounts previously granted
on these items. - - . v

Just how this is going to bring in more orders is a question.
It can only lead to further insecurity for the brass mill workers.

MINE-MILL for years has had a forward-looking program
for brass, designed to increase and stabilize industry employ-
ment. At this time of crisis, it's appropriate to review it briefly.

Our union has long supported an adequate tariff on foreign
brass mill products to protect the jobs and wages of our mem-
bership. About 3,000 full-time jobs in American brass mills have
been lost to foreign, competition over the last few years. .

Our union in brass bargaining has sought ‘the 35-hour week
with take-home pay for 40 hours. This step alone would restore
4,000 lost jobs in the brass mills. - -

- >3 * tit

MINE-MILL has always opposed the restrictive, tight-money
policies of the Eisenhower administration——instead has favored
a federal program of slum clearance and low-cost housing, plus
public works and policies generally to foster fuller employment
and security for working people. In housing, our objective has
been 2,000,000 new units a year, or roughly double the present
rate of housing starts. This expanded housing program alone

‘would create over 1,000 new jobs in brass mills.

Finally, we favor vigorous policing of the industry under
the federal antitrust laws to prevent monopolistic price gouging
in brass and copper, and to build toward expanded and more
stable markets for the industry. . ‘

Our program, if realized in full, would restoreover 8,000.

jobs in the brass industry, provide greater security and stability

of employment, and assure an expanding market. for our rapidly

dom, the Congress of the United

States has finally gotten around to pass",

its second civil rights bill since reconstruc-
tion days, some 90 years ago

I believe that some of the 
thanks for this latest step

 

 

man rights in our country
can be given to authorities
in the state of Alabama
and to its Governor, John

their contribution in this
cause has been negative,
but their very resistance to
permitting even those mini-
mum of rights embodied in

the civil rights act passed Howard

by the Congress in 1957 served to emphasize

the need for additional legislation if the intent
of the 1957 act was to have any meaning at all.

The fact that Alabama looked for every pos-
sible loop-hole to continue to deny the basic

voting right of citizenship to thousands of

Negroes in itself pointed up and attracted na-
tional attention even more sharply to the issue.

**k‘k

HE CIVIL Rights Commission, established
by Congress in 1957 to look into the denial

of the right to vote, encountered the first of-

ficialresistance to its task in Macon County,
Alabama, where it had co-me to examine Voters’
registration records. * , v -

Yet despite such obstructions, the Commis-
sion still -managed to find out and publish
some facts which the public in general had not
known before. Among these was the fact that

"in certain Alabama counties, no Negro was al-

lowed to vote.
These are some of the conditions which

helped to bring about the passage by Con-'_’

gress of a little better law regarding voting
rights this past April.
.* ‘Ir ‘k
0 AFTER some eight weeks of debate and
filibustering about a right which was al-
ready guaranteed by the Constitution, the hard-
fought and much-compromised 1960 Civil
Rights bill was finally passed by Congress and
signed into law by the President. _ _

: While it is not the best measure that could
have come out, I do believe it is a great help
in the continuing fight for equal rights foriall
citizens. -

President Eisenhower said the bill deals
meaningfully ‘‘with the key I Constitutional
right of every American, the right to vote
without ‘discrimination on account of race or
color.” He said: “The main provision authoriz-
ing federal judges to appoint referees to de-
termine voting qualiﬁcations of Negroes holds
great promise of making the 15th Amendment
of the Constitution fully meaningful.”

‘k*~k

CCORDING to the new law, any official
who refused to let court-certified Negroes

vote would be guilty of contempt of court. A’ ,
AAlabama’s first act to by-pass the 1960 Civil
Rights law is to purge the voting lists. I have

been summoned to appear before the Jeffew

 Officers Push Fight

For Aged

Care Bill

DENVER—A letter from Mine-Mi1l’s top officersto
U. S. senators and congressmen in 28 states last month
urged passage of the Forand bill as “the only practical
-measure now before Congress” which would provide med-
ical care for the aged under social security.

“No single legislative

- l_ matter b e f o r e Congress

this year has aroused greater
-interest among our member-

» ship,” the letter said, advis-

€‘n
V. '.

ing the national legislators
from Mine-Mill areas that “the

' membership of our union is

watching this matter with
great and close interest.”

At the same time, the union
leaders termed’ a substitute
measure proposed by the Ad-
ministration “a patent fraud
upon our elderly citizens.”

* alt *

OBJECTING first to the Ad-

. ministration plan’s proposed

method of financing the pro-
gram t h r o u g h federal-state
matching of funds, the let-
ter pointed out that “this
-very feature alone places tre-
mendous obstacles in the way
of making medical coverage

, immediately available to our

elderly citizens” and that it
would be years before some

states would see fitto match
federal funds to make the
plan operative. ._

Also attacked was the plan
requirement ‘of a $24 yearly
enrollment fee and the fact
that benefit recipients would
have to foot the bill for the
first $250 or $400 of their
medical costs before any of
the services provided. in the
plan became available to them,
as well as having to pay 20
per cent of all subsequent
medical bills. “ 7 ‘

The letter charged that the
entire Administration proposal
“seems calculated to fatten
the pockets of the insurance
companies rather than take
care of our retired citizens.”

Responses_to the letter from
dozens of Congressmen and
Senators have already been
received in the International
office, most of them express-
ing agreement with the un-
ion’s position.

Wide Suppoit Greets Roosevelt 
Call for Probe Committee Ends 

WASHINGTON, D. C.——Two major events in recent weeks focused attention on ~
a groundswell of public opposition to the witch-hunt antics of the House Un—American
Activities Committee and the demand that it be abolished.

First, on April 25 in the U. S. House of Representatives, Congressman James
Roosevelt (D., Calif.) delivered a major speech calling for abolition of the House com-

mittee and exposing par-
ticularly its high-handed
and cruelly unfair treatment
of teachers in California.

it >l< wk

RO0SEVELT’S attack on
the , -/Un-American committee
andihis call for its abolition
immediately received the open
siipport of America’s leading
newspaper, the New York
Times.

On April 30 the New York
Times published an editorial
backing Roosevelt’s “massive
attack on the Committee” and
calling attention to the de-
cision by the American Civil
Liberties Union “for a ‘maxi-

mum effort’ to abolish it.”

The Times said: “Just as
the Senate had to ultimately
take responsibility for the out-
rages committed in its name
by the late Senator McCarthy,
so the House is responsible for
the actions of Representative
Walter’s Un-American Activ-
ities Committee.”

 ,   New Defense Evidence Punches

  Additional Holes in SACB Case

WASHINGTON, D. C.——Further developments in the SACB proceedings before
hearing officer» Francis A. Cherry in Bridgeport, Conn., and Washington continued to

   
  
 

unearth new evidence punchin

- against Mine-Mill.

g additional holes in the government’s five-year-old case

On April 26 in Bridgeport, Harold Kent, a paid informer for the FBI and prosecu-

"tion witness in the case,
was subjected to cross-ex-
amination by Mine-Mill Gen-

' eral Counsel Nathan Witt on
the basis of material the gov-
ernment is now required to
furnish under the so-called
Jencks law.

It was brought out that
Kent’s own reports to the FBI
in 1955 and 1956 regarding
what Irving Dichter had told
him clearly refuted the charge
-that Dichter filed a false Taft-
Hartley non-Communist af-

-q "'-“' fidavit in February of 1955.

.Kent had failed to mention
this when he testified» against
Dichter in 1957.
, (On the basis of this new
. evidence, defense attorneys in
the Denver -Taft-Hartley con-
spiracy case have filed a mo-

31 -tion in the Federal iDistrict
 Court for a new trial for
f’,Du'ichter _ and the other eight
 ldefendants whose conviction
A . last December is now under .

1-.\ g appeal. The.-defense will argue
 that the prosecution failed to

  

 

disclose this evidence at the
trial as it was required to do
under decisions of the Supreme
Court.)

ANOTHER paid FBI in-
former, Bill Duran, was re-
called for cross-examination
with resumption of the hear-
ings in Washington on May 9.

Witt brought out on the
basis of material’ from FBI
files that Duran had lied in
1957 when he testified he had
stopped reporting to the FBI
in August of 1954. The FBI
material itself showed that he
had made reports to the FBI
in January, March and April
of _1955. Duran repeated the
same lie when he testified in
another case (a Smith act
trial) in March of 1958, and
gave other false testimony
during that same case, Witt
showed. .

,-The new hearings have also

disclosed that Kent, ‘Duran

   

   

and two other paid informers
have made a good thing out of
their “patriotic” work for the
FBI. As informers, Kent was
paid more than $8,000 by the
FBI, Duran received $9,667,
and two other informers re-

ceived $9,500 and $13,350

apiece.

=11 * 1<

THE HEARINGS continued
in Washington, just before
the Mine-Mill Union was go-
ing to press, with Fred Gard-
ner and Bobby G. Fikes as
new witnesses. Both had testi-
fied in the Taft-Hartley con-
spiracy case. ~

Six other wtnesses who re-
fused to appear for further
cross - examination by Witt

were dropped from the case‘

when the government moved
to have all their testimony
against Mine-Mill stricken from
the record rather, than pro-
duce statements they had pre-
viously made to the_F-BI. ‘

 

in favor of his stand for
abolishing the Committee.

THE SECOND
event was

important
the tremendous

public protest over the Un-

American committee's hear-
ings in San Francisco May 12-
14, dramatized in demonstra-
tions against the hearings by
thousands of students from
the‘ University of California,
San ‘Francisco State College,
Stanford and other northern
California colleges.

It was much more than cam-
pus opposition, h owever.
Among the groups voicing op-
position against the Commit-
tee hearings were: the Cali-
fornia AFL-CIO State Labor
Federation, the Episcopal

Diocese of California, the San V I *

Jose Unitarian Church, the

state convention of the Cali- -7

fornia Young Democrats, and
the Santa Clara County Demo-
cratic Council.

The UNION GAZETTE,.pub-if

lication of the Central Labor

& Building Trades Council of .

May 13 that not only had most

of the foregoing joined Cong. . _

Roosevelt's call for abolition
of the committee, but the San

Dozens of other organiza-
tions, church, labor and profes-

Excerpts from Roosevelt Speech A

“The Committee indicts itself by its Very conduct . . . First
of all, it spends large amounts of needed time, energy and
money in ponderously investigating and restating the obvious

. . Second, it combines with this a contrasting inability to

understand the very real complexities of human behaviour . . .
Third, as the Air Force Manual controversy illustrates, the

Committee has repeatedly shown its inability to stick to its

own business . . .

“Fourth, the Committee has no real usefulness . . .
various police and counterespionage agencies do what the Com-
mittee merely claims to do . . . Fifth, despite the existence of

the police . . . the Committee has undertaken to constitute itself A

as a roving police and prosecution agency . . . Sixth, the Com-

mittee also acts as a Court . . . yet it is not subject to the re-

straints we impose upon our judiciary.

“Seventh, the mandate which we did in fact give the Com- ,1
mittee is in itself defective and inherently contrary to our

The 4

democratic traditions. How did we come to establish a Com- 

mittee to decide what was ‘un-American,’ and still worse how 1

did We persuade ourselves that propaganda, speech, was a fit , '

subject for regulation by inquisitional techniques such as the
Committee employs?
. ._ alt >!< Ik

“TO ME, the very nature of that commission is at war

with our profoundest principles, and it cannot help but be exe- '

cuted in a manner destructive of those principles. We have, in
effect, created an agency to supervise the exercise of ‘First
Amendment rights, an organ for censorship and suppression.

_“Finally, we come to what I think is the most serious‘

criticism of the Committee, the fact that it has become an
agency for the destruction of human  and constitutional
ri hts . . . '
gv “Mr. Speaker, fellow members of the House, it is, I think,
a monstrous thing that we created such an institution and
lent, it our powers and prestige. But we can also end this ter-
rible agency and take back our powers. '
“I urge the rest of my colleagues to give this matter
serious thought and to speak of it when they return to their
constituencies this summer. I think we need only break that
spell of anxiety to find wide support for the‘ abolition of this
thoroughly bad institution. Then those who return here next
January can complete this imperative task which is the busi-

ness of this House alone. We would then be acting in the serv- ,

ice of our best traditions. Let us set our House aright.” _

month with approval by House Interior Commission of a re-

payments on up to 2,000 tons each of lead and zinc per year

Africa Differential

Fifty years ago all skilled
jobs and most semi-skilled
jobs
region now carved up into the
Union of South Africa, Rho-
desia and Nyasaland-—were
performed by European

(white) immigrant workers.

because native workers lacked
the necessary training and
skills. P‘
European workers were
paid high wages to attract
them to the new country. Na-
tive workers performing un-
skilled jobs were paid as much
as 90 percent less than Euro-
peans, and differentials of this
magnitude have continued
practically unchanged  to
the present. ‘ ;, " '
Since the end of thefsecond
ore
Africans have gained the abil-
ity to hold down skilled and
semi-skilled jobs. European-

’ only unions have op pgosed
' moves to employ Africans" in

such work, and in the ‘Union
of South Africa‘ the govern-
ment itself, as part of_ its in-
famous Apartheid policy‘, has
sought to freeze this employ-
ment Ppattern. ‘
ti‘ 11¢ 1!‘ '_

IN THE LAST fifteen years,
European unions in Rhodesia,
seeing the unwisdom of es-
pousing racial bars to -better
paid jobs, have offered no ob-
jectionto employment of Afri-
cans in skilled or semi-skilled
jobs, provided they are paid
the same high Wages received
by Europeans. In prajgitice, this
has meant the exclusion of
African workers from skilled
jobs because the Europeans
have benefited from superior
training.

Some Rhodesian copper min-
ing companies in the last few
years have made a flank at-
tack on the problem by “frag-
mentation” of skilled jobs held
by Europeans — breaking the
job down into two or more
jobs to be held _by Africans,

in Southern Africa~—a,

with combined pay not less
than the pay of the European

formerly doing the whole job.-

Last month a somewhat dif-
ferent planwas approved for
the Rhodesia Railways, which
hauls out all -the copper mined
in the Copperbelt—about 600,-
000 tons a year. A few jobs at
first, and eventually all jobs
up to general "manager, are to
be open ‘to all races, with
“fragmentation” of some jobs,
accompanied by a broad on-
the-job training program.

The African railway work-
ers union, recalling past fail-

ures to even make a start tow-'

ard job equality, is going along
with the new.railway program
on a walit-and-see basis. At
best, the program’ will bring
advancement. for A f ri c a n
workers slowly.

Slave-Labor Camps

W. B.“ Schipper,- consulting
mining engineer in a talk to
to the National Western Min-
ing and Energy Conference in
Denver in April told members,
“you who are associated with
the smaller and medium-sized
mines are indeed aware that
you face grave problems to-
day . . . It would cost more
money under today’s cost con-
ditions to maintain a slave in
the United States than it does
to pay a wage scale in some
of the so-called backward na-
tions.”

In U.S. currency equivalent,
he cited wages per day of
$2.30 in Mexico, 470 in Nica-
ragua, $1.52 in Peru, $1.74 in
the Philippines, 79c in South
Africa, 42c in Northern Rho-
desia, 34c in Southern Rho-
desia and 8'/¢,c in_ Nyasaland.

“This, so that minerals and
metals can be obtained a
penny or two less per unit
than American miners can
produce it, and still make
fantastic fortunes for the
American mine owners abroad
who are doing these things,”
Schipper commented.

frequently and sometimes can-
not be traced, he said.

Chile Strike 5-
Anacenda

SANTIAGO, Chile——
Nearly 4,000 mine, mill and
smelter workers, and 900
clerical workers have been
on strike since May 1 at
Anaconda’s El Salvador copper
mine and Potrerillos smelter
in Chile. The workers are
members of local unions affil-
iated with the Chilean Copper
Workers Confederation, which
also covers other Anaconda
and Kennecott inines in Chile.

.Weeks of: fruitless negotia- 
tions precededithestrike. The _
copper workers principal de-. 
mand is a 60 per cent wage in-
crease to offset the severe in-
flation in Chile which has been
eroding the purchasing power_
of the workers’ take-home pay.

The Anaconda management of-
fered a 35 per cent increase '
originally, and just before the
strike raised its offer to 55 per
cent.

Industry-wide support was
promptly pledged the strikers —
at El Salvador and Potrerillos _
by Copper Workers Confedera-
tion affiliates at Anaconda’s
Chuquicamata mine and smell.
ter and at Kennecott’s El Te-
niente mine. Workers at these
mines voted overwhelmingly
in favor of a sympathy walk-
out in support of the men on

- strike.
- ti * =l<

CONTRACTS with the unions
at’ Chuquicamata and El Te- _. '
niente do not expire until late
this year. After the vote, offi-=
cials of the Confederation act-
ed to postpone the sympathy
walkout as government medi- _
ators sought to bring the par- 1. 
ties together at El Salvador.  

The big question mark in
Chile today is whether the. .
country is in for widespread 
strikes. About 15,000 coal min-
ers have been on strike for
more than two months, while
5,000 workers at an American-
owned power company have
been on strike since April_.2.
All told, more than 70,000
Chilean -workers are currently
on strike, according to a re-
port from Santiago.

One important source of dis-
satisfaction is the tight-money
austerity program imposed on
the Chilean government by the
U. --S. banker-dominated Inter-
national Monetary Fund as a
condition of financial aid -to
Chile. . .

The struck El Salvador mine
is the newest large under-
ground copper mine to be

' opened anywhere in the world

in_ recent years. Its output
runs about 7,500 tons of cop-W, 
per per month. Chuquicamata '
(25,000 tons per month) and
E1 Tiniente (16,000 tons per
month) together employ about
18,000 workers.

go along with the company’s
demand to extend the present
life insurance and pension
plans without change until
July 1, 1961.

Thisserious effort for a fair_

‘ settlement to keep the union’s
Bunker Hill members on an
even keel with the rest of the
‘industry was rejected_by the
company, forcing the strike

action.

WITH the orderly shutdown,
arrangements were made to
allow admission of certain su-
pervisors showing passes sign-
ed by Local 18. Picket lines
are being manned on schedule
around the clock at all proper-
ties. Strike headquarters, out
of which various strike com-
mittees are functioning, re-
main open on a 24-hour-a-day
basis.

The local’s active Ladies
Auxiliary is aiding the strug-
gle by contacting merchants,
‘organizations and community
g-_groups, as well as helping to
man strike headquarters, as-
sisting with clerical and other
details. The women also have
crews bringing food and cof-
fee to the pickets at all hours,
and are keeping a record of
problems brought to their at-
tention for referral to the ap-
propriate strike ‘committees.

Notice has been served man-
agementthat the union stands
ready to negotiate at any
time. The company has al-
ready launched an anti-labor
propaganda drive in an at-
tempt to undermine the strike.

AS&R, Day Mines

Negotiations,’ meanwhile,
were continuing between Lo-
cal 18 and AS&R, Day Mines
and other smaller operators
in the Coeur d’Alenes Where
the companies, for the most
part, have been duplicating
Bunker Hill’s position.

,._,..At the AS&R property in
particular, the union has at-
tempted in every way possible
to bring about a two-year 22.5

, cents per hour package settle-
ment in line with the pattern
already established through-
out Mine-Mill's national AS&R
jurisdiction.

Although ASARCO workers
elsewhere have long since set-
tled for gains which in most
places were better than those
even asked for here, the com-

. . pany has remained adamant

Dear Sir and-Brother:

DENVER 1. COLORADO

We are gravely concerned about the prosecution of several officers
and employees of your organization on a charge of conspiring to defraud the
Government by falsely signing non—Cornmunist affidavits.

Several aspects of the prosecution seem most peculiar to us ---- the
fact that three of the individuals convicted never signed the affidavits, the
fact that more than three years elapsed between the handing down of the in-
dictment and the beginning of trial, the fact that trial finally began in the
midst of a long strike by your Union against the Big Five copper companies,
and the fact that trial began after the Ta.ft—Hart1ey Act was amended to elim-
inate the requirements for non—Communist affidavits.

Even more disturbing is the fact that the prosecution is based on a
"conspiracy" charge. Historically, the conspiracy charge has been a major

device in attempts to destroy trade unionism.

It will be a terrible blow to

American unions if the conspiracy device again comes into common usage in
the prosecution and persecution of unions.

I hope and trust that in the appeal of your case through the higher courts,
you are able to secure a reversal of the conspiracy convictions handed down
by the District Federal Court.‘ Or, even better, I hope that the Attorney

General sees fitlto drop

PRESIDENT RANDOLPH
conveyed the deep concern of
his railroad workers interna-
tional “about the persecution
of the officers of your union.”
“I sincerely hope,” he said,
“that in the appeal of your
case to the higher courts you
will be able to reverse this
conspiracy conviction”

“The whole procedure seems
strange to me,” wrote Presi-
dent Burke of the Pulp, Sul-
phite & Paper Mill Workers,
noting that some of the de-
fendants never even signed
T-H affidavits, that three
years elapsed between the in-
dictment and the trial, and
that the trial began in the
midst of the union’s nation-
wide copper strike.
