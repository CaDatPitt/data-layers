 its vice-president, E. S. McGlone

matter full consideration, we
whaige concluded that such a pro-
'"'cedure (company - wide bargain-

 “.O,ur operations,” -McGlone_ wrote,

time to negotiate a contract on a Com-
pany-wide basis in New York.”

"“"A SIMILAR letter came-from Louis,

E. ‘ST. LOUIS, Il.l.—With 1952 her-

as in most’ other Mine-Mill locals
around the country, Fairmont Smelter
Workers Local 82 has already won a 8
cent wage increase from American

The 3-centhiike came in negotiations -

just concluded under a wage reoponer
contained in the contract signed last
September. Thecompany insisted that
the 3 cents represented the‘ maximum
that could be “allowed” under existing
Wage Stabilization Board formulas.

v‘ _ T

The utility trusts, and Army brass hats
are again responsible for unparalleled waste
and human suffering caused by the over-
ﬂowing _Missouri River. Once again,’ as it

" has each year for the last ten, it has been

demonstrated that the Pick-Sloan plan‘ to
control the course of the Missouri is futile,

nonsensical, extravagant, and the ‘pet proect

of a hard—boi1ed lobby .of the power com-
panies and reactionary military engineers.

This time the Missouri flood blocked .27
railroads, broke 83 main highways, displaced

some 90,000 persons, flooded 60 cities and ‘

towns, inundated 2,073,000 acres of farm

‘land, breached 153’private levees and caused

200 million dollars worth of damage.

The annual game of the army engineers
is to build dikes and levees, pile up untold

numbers of sand bags and then wait to see 

What will happen. It does. Each year the
Missouri " and its branches become swollen
torrents and knock over the army's sand
castles. The damage is worse every year, the

death toll mounts, more farmers are ruined

-—and the profits’ of the private power cor-
porations are safe for another year.

, ALL OF THIS is by way of reminding
our Congressmen that the International Un-
ion of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers wants
them to dust off the plan for a Missouri Val-

ley Authority and bring a certain and early
end. to the ‘devastation of annual spring
floods. As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said
the other day: T

“It is time to lay a sound basis for stop-
ping floods and saving soil and harnessing
water power for. constructive ‘use as was
done nearly 20 years ago in the Tennessee
Valley. 

“There isnothing that President Truman
can do for his own part of the country and
his home people that should give him as
much, satisfaction ‘as advancing a great
cause. , _  y

“N ow,-— now——-NOV/V—N OW is the time 3”

The International Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers demands to know why the
plan for an MVA is rotting in some Congres-
sional pigeon-hole. Is it because the discred-
ited ‘Picl;-Sloan plan is one’ of thelushest
political pork barrels ever devised?

CONGRESS must act immediately, in the
interest of workers whose jobs are wiped
out by ﬂoods, in the interest of farmers
whose life savings are wiped out, in the in-
terest of flood control, cheap power, and a

 

vast peacetime, employment-producing proj-

ect that would eliminate the horror of ﬂoods
forever and help the area prosper.

“Our, union, other I unions and organiza-

tions, millions of people have been support-

..4'ng the MVA plan since it was first proposed

in the days of_ the New.Deal. It is becoming
increasingly more difficult for the utility
vandals to cover up their crime--their pat

_»f‘The union came slow to the mills,

agreed as_ they talked about the
truggle. And they talked of D. C.

ired, as president of Utah Copper Co.

A étill alive, and there are 14 unions on

 tamed. ~ =

Cone of the old-timers remembered
1  ' \ I

 ’But a few of the men were still de-
' _‘lA:ermined to start Aa real union in the

‘iiln June,“ 1937, and began to sign the
A f linen up slowly. There were two elec-

Won “the first election, but was two
A'f.yo_t'es short of having the majority of
'* fglvigible voters as then required by the
. ‘A ag11A1fer1Act. And the union lost the
‘T tuna e ection six weeks 1 ter.

i — f‘iN THE SPRING of 1939, we got
.. . pggther and really started to reorgan-
D ~_e, one of the old-timers said. “It
fol: usfour more years to do it, but
1?. at was when we -started the push
that finally made the grade.”

Not long after the reorganization
ugrive began in 1939, the National La-

Aor Relations Board held__a hearing to
A,-_e_.term1ne whether the phony company
‘ ._1él:nion at the mills and at Bingham
. . _~anyon was a legitimateiunion. When
i ,hAe hearing was over, the trial exami-
 er recommended that the company
gunion be dis-established and refund all
: gu.es‘p'aid to it by the Kennecott work-
 The NLRB upheld the recommenda-
A. flan of its examiner. “And that’s when

3:119 big court fights began,” the old-
  ers mused. “The company took. the

Iprder to the 10th Circuit Court and
0 1A tried to get it thrown out. But the Cir-
2 Quit Court upheld the NLRB, so the

 hose to the U.S. Supreme_Court.”

 i0lld- timers tell how   i
.e,L0Acal 3392 got .started  .

' T MAGNA, Utah-—Some of the old-timers were in a reminiscent
mood ‘last week as they helped dedicate their new local 392 Union Hall.
 "The old-time‘rs——men like Penny Buckner, L. O. McKendrick, Vic
Bohne, H. S. Johnson, “Weary” Newbold, Earl Hall, Sam Marlor, Sr.——
thought back to the long years when they were fighting to start a

and it sure didn't come easy,” they .

ill',’7 one of the old‘-timers remem-

:‘.‘B'EFORE~‘ MINE-MILPL  made its V

100 men would come in and sign up
with Local 392. So we kept growing
while all this was happening-because
all the rulings. were in our favor.” A

The Supreme Court decision uphold-
ing the NLRB finally was made in‘
1943. A few months later, a represen-
tation election was held at the mills
and Mine-Mill finallywon its bargain-
ing rights in the spring of 1944. Mine-
Mill's jurisdiction covered all workers

at the mills except the employees of

the B & G railroad andcarshop. Later
Local 392 took in -the maintenance of‘
way workers after a_ card check by the
NLRB in 1945.

--“So it was in September, 1944-—just
10 years after Mine-Mill first tried to
organize the miAlls—that we finally got
our f i r s 1: contract,”
summed up. “But we sure went places
after that.”

The local has had two real strikes
since it won recognition in 1943. A five-
month walkout in 1946 won a “first
roundA” of postwar wage increases
amounting toi$1.48 a day.» And the
more than 1,400 Arthur & Magna mill-
men ‘were among‘ the 60,000 copper

workers who walked out on a 10-day A

strike last August._A_

REVIEWING the local’s history, the
old-timers pointed out that there have
been three raiding attempts “on the

50' of the United Mine Workers was
fought off. Then in 1947 a secession
move, instigated by the Progressive
was blocked
when the workers voted in a secret
referendum to remain in Mine-Mill.
The last raid just a .year ago, was
brought by the CIO Steelworkers and
was overwhelmingly defeated in an
NLRB election. » '

“What’s kept us in Mine-Mill,” one
of the old-timers remarked, “is our
company-wide bargaining ‘program and
our Mine-Mill=Kennecott Council. And .
the successfulindustry-wide strike last
fall binds us to Mine-Mill tighter than .,
ever. It's the union for us, all right.”

for showdown wth WSB 

TUNGSTEN, Nev. -— Members of '
Mine-Mill Local 893 last week were‘

getting ready for a showdown with the
Wage Stabilization Board and their
boss-—Nevada-Massachusetts Company.

~ And they say they intend to strike if

they don't getwhat rightfully belongs
to them. . ‘ ‘

The Board, in a ruling reported by

the last issue of-THE UNION, had cut
18 cents an hour from the top miner’s
rate won by the union in negotiations
with the company. The WSB contended
that if the rates negotiated by the
union were put into effect, they would
“unstabilize” the wage picture in the
area. _ A.

The~ruling resulted fromAdirect pres-
sure on the WSB by the Defense Man-
power Agency, which has been-- cam-
paigning for the importation of 5,000
displaced persons to work in western
mining camps.

MEMBERS of Local 893 shut the
mine down on Thursday, April 17Ain
order to hold a meeting at which they
talked over the WSB action-—and de-
cidedto take a strike vote. Four days
later, they shut the mine down again
in order to take the strike vote——which

..resulted in a tally showing 128 in favor
of strike action, and only. 18 against.

The strike deadline was set for mid-
May, in order to give the WSB a full
.30 days in which to act on the appeal
of its decision which the union has
filed. A '0

Meantime, the local conducted a sur-
vey of the wage .,pi_cA,t,ure in the area,
and found that rather than “unsta“bil-

A”_ izing” the district, their proposed wage

 

increases would actually help to bring
stability. , ~ V
The miners in the iron ore pits at
nearby Lovelock are earning‘ $2.00 an-
_ hour, as compared to the $1.83 which‘
top miners are demanding at- Nevada-
Massachusetts. _It was the $1.83 rate
at Nevada-Massachusetts which the
WSB cut down to $1.65'—an 18 cent an
hour cut.‘ ‘
Truck drivers in th area are earn-
--ing $1.86 an hour, while Mine-Mill's
new contract with Nevada-Massachu-

 setts calls for $1.83. Common labor

working on maintainance of ways on -
the Southern Pacific RR are earning’
$1.44, while the Mine-Mill pact calls for
$1.45 for common labor.

So it’As easy to see why the workers-
in Local 893 are more determined than
ever to get the wage increase‘ they ne- ‘

‘ gotiated with the company—all of it.

The Korean war has pulled the rug from under the Connecticut
brass worker. His working hours are fewer. His pay is smaller. He has

 

a harder timekeeping a job. Unemployment haunts the industry.

Allthis is happening to the Connecticut brass worker at the same
time that the cost of living has skyrocketed» and increased taxes have

cut his already meagre wages.

These facts are just a few contained in a Mine-Mill’ economic stud

of the brass industry. It is a study which has shaken the brass valley
' from one. end to the other. The people of the valley understand what
is meant by the twin evils of “war AND depression.” To them, war

and depression have come to mean the same thing.

' And the people of the valley are not
relying on the brass Vc_ompan,_ies to lead
any crusade for jobs and prosperity.

‘Thanks to Mine-Mill’s concerted cam-
paign to focus attention on tl'l?£';plight

of the brass workers, the people of
Ansonia, Derby, Seymour, Bridgeport,
Torrington, Thomaston, Waterbury,
and other brass towns are expressing
serious doubts about the desire of the
brass manufacturers. to help solve the
problem. They point to record brass
company profits as evidence that the
corporations are doing all right as
things "are. It’s the workers and their
families who are ‘bearing the brunt of
Ali‘c':e'-in—Wonderland economics arising

‘out of war preparations. .

‘ ‘ Employment drops sharply
Employment has dropped sharply

since the Korean war began. Between

the peacetime peak of 28,740 brass "val-

“__.ley jobs in 1947 and January. of this
}year,= more than 6,000 workers lost
2 -their jobs in the industry. In the state

as a whole, employment‘ has dropped

, at least 22 per cent since 1947.

Further depression of brass valley
families’ buying power has come about

.. because the Connecticut brass workers

"(who have_kept their jobs. are working
"shorter work weeks. The average Con-
necticut brass worker in 1950 Worked
43.8 hours a week. In 1951 he worked

a only 40.79 hours a Week. Many workers

put in time for only three and four day
schedules at various times throughout
the year. The Copper and Brass Re-

 search Association reported:

“Some of the brass mill fabricators
and other important elements have been
forced either to go out of business or
suspend operations for varying periods
or ‘operate at reduced capacity.”

The industry organ, American Metal
Market, has reported that Chase‘ Brass
has announced fo’ur—day schedules.
Plume and Atwood cut operations to
three-day schedules and laid off work-
ers because government allotments of
copper were out or refused entirely for
Bridgeport Brass has
said that unless it substitutes alum-
inum for copper, it will be forced to
operate at only 75 per cent of capacity.

Take-home pay down. too

Primarily because of shorter hours,
actual money wages of Connecticut
brass workers have been cut since 1950.
Thedowntrend is continuing. In 1950
the average weekly wage was $72.07
in the Waterbury mills. In 1951 wages

_ declined more than $3 per week. A
slight increase in January has been.

more than offset by the increase in the
cost of living, arise of 11 per cent

between the beginning of the Korean ,
‘war in June 1950 and December 1951.

-The ‘drastic fall in real wages (what
take home pay can buy for the Con-
necticut brass worker and his family)
is not shown by the changes in money
wages. "In 1950, the average weekly

‘wage of brass workers amounted to

$42‘a. week in terms of the 1935-39‘
dollar. A year after the Korean war
began, the real purchasing power of
theworkers’ weekly paycheck had been
slashed to $37, a decline of $5 or 12
per cent. And by January, 1952, al-
though‘ hou__rs- worked increase.‘ slightly,

’:‘ real wages had fallen still further to
Mine-Mill Regional Director

Irving Ditcher describes this situation
as “a return to WPA wages.” ’

Increased taxes have also reduced
income for the brass worker. Higher
taxes mean still further cuts in take
home pay. Workers paid about 17 per
centlmore income tax Tn 1951’ than in
1950 and 22 per cent more than in 1949.
This year even greater tax increases
are being planned as the result of

Co. had written him a letter more than
a month ago on the question of civilian
production which they were barred from
undertaking. Benton had never an-
swered the letter. Blackme:- asked:
“What are you going to do about it?”

Benton replied feebly that he must
have overlooked the letter and that he
would “check into it.”

Board member Albert Pezzati took
the “floor to say he was proud to be
part of the leadership of a union with
the history and record of Mine-Mill, “a

record of outstanding,accomplishment ‘

and achievement for our membership.”
The delegation applauded this reply to

Bento'n’s attack on the national leader- »

ship of our union; ‘ .

Pezzati went on" to expose the double-
talk of a coppershortagewhen four-.
fifths of the world’s copper supply is
controlled by American corporations
who have ‘diverted it to other markets

0 instead of making it available for pro- ,

duction in theiriown plants at home.

In the.face of the hostile delegation, 1

Benton, ‘rod-faced and ill at ease,«in-

and red baiting and left“ hastily. As
the morning session (adjourned, Dichter

We who belong to the Ladies Auxili-
ary here in Bayard, and who are Mexi-
can-American, know it is hard. for oth-
er people‘ such as Mrs. Annie Petek and
Mrs. Chas.‘ Wandenklee to understand
the problems of our peoplepliving here
in the Southwest United States. So we
would like to invite some of them to
come‘. and see this conquered territory.

The Judy Canova Show is good for
only one thing. .It carried on the ideas
that nationalities are “different” in
funny ways. -We all likezto laugh, but~\_

not at our brothers and sisters. Pedro "

is no more like anyof us than stupid,’
lazy people in movies and radio are like
Negro men and women. We notice that _‘
not only does the Judy Canova program
give wrong ideas about Mexicans,,but
it also portrays the Negro character as

- fat and silly. V

Some people may think we don't have
a sense of humor, but since when is it
funny to keep on telling a Hitler kind
of lie, that nationalities with darker
skins are shiftless and lazy and dumb?_
In fact, what good is a show that keep
spreading such germs? ‘

The truth is that we, the Spanish-
speaking people have traditions and
culture as old and as worthwhile as any
in the United States and in the Amer-
icas. . p _ /

So please friends don't make the _so-
called “American” mistake of thinking
humor means making - exaggerated
jokes about other races or nationalities.
We Americans already have a bad

reputation for our prejudices and 'our

treatment of American minority
groups. One way we can overcome this
a little is by removing the “Judy Ca-
nova Show” and “Amos and Andy”
from being broadcast. Then our kids,
won't grow up with some of the dis-
crimination ideas we older people have.

llouse passes bill
for ‘Nuremberg law’

WASHINGTON,‘ D. C.—The urgent .

danger that the McCarran-Walter im-
migration and naturalization bill might
be enacted into law became hotter last
week. The 'House passed the Walter
omnibus version of the bill by a vote of
.206 to 68‘and jubilantbackers of the
measure predicted finalpassage before
Congress adjourns. I

The measures have been described
as ‘‘America’s, Nuremberg Laws,” and

are opposed by the AFL, CIO and many A

other organizations. ‘They would addj13
new grounds for exclusion and at least
12 added grounds for deportation.
Before the Walter "bill passed the
House it was sternly indicted as an
anti-Negro bill by Rep. Adam Powell
(D, N.Y.). He charged that the anti-‘
Negro bias in both the present immi-

gration law and the McCarran-Walter-v“

billswas inspired bythe Ku Klux Klan.
POWELL expressed concern that

. 'anti-civil liberties features of the bill.

will be used against Negroes.- He

pointed out than any alien, no matter ,

how long he has lived in this country,
may be deported if he has violated a
city ordinance and the attorney genera
finds‘ him undesirable. _-
He emphasized that the pending bills
would allow immigration officials tocin-4
vade private homes of American citi-
zens and cross-examine them under the
pretended beliefithey are aliens.
House approval of thebill meant that
fredom loving American citizens must
step up their drive to halt the measure
_in the Senate. Letters, resolutions, and
post cards to U. S. Senators are needed
to demand that the McCar1;an bill—-
S. 2550~—-be defeated.

A review of the serious situation ex-
isting? in ‘the Eastern smelters and re-
T fineriesl was given to the Council by
 i Herb Lerner, Mine-Mill Regional Di-
I relctc‘§r‘,in New Jersey.
_ Lerner pointed out thiitall the East-
 .7erm,.xe£ineries were operating so far
‘below ‘capacity._tl_1at;over a thousand
- jobs have been lost.
 The main immediate reason for this
T .5de5:lin,e, Lerner stated, was the mili-
 taryhstoclgpipling of enormous amounts
pg; of pepper; This gobbling ‘up of a large
 » part of the world's copper ‘supply for
V" the American stockpile resulted in a
T T ‘copper-starved world. that bids fantas-
W vj eticprices for any available copper.
I ’  ,AMERICAN copper companies that
 town or control the overwhelming pro-
2 portion of copper outside the United
States now refuse to send their copper
_to_ the States, but sell it in foreign
‘countries at the inflated price. 3 This

 
 

results in a much smaller amount of ~

foreign blister copper coming to the

. , l,Eastern Seaboard for refining, and
 very little of ore concentrates for

’ ‘ ' smelting. , it

A much more serious danger to the

jobs’ of refinery workers, Lerner stat-

. ed, was ~ the increasing practice of

" r'American copper companies of build-
, e ' ing smelters and refineries in colonial
' countries. During the _last two years,
‘Americiihi-owned smelters and refin-

r eries have been built in Chile, Peru,

' and. Northern Rhodesia. At the same

__ -time, a large refinery has been built

’ f I  Utah to handle domestic-mined cop-
; per.%  ‘ . .

' ‘\‘The big copper companies,” Lerner
a.-empl1asi'zé‘d, “‘are interested only in
. W'_p1jof'its. _If they can make more profits
~ V by paying Rhodesian or Peruvian work-
 _ersT_,$'1200 a day, they don’t give a hang
];what' happens to‘ workers in Carteret,
‘Perth Amboy or Baltimore. If we are
jtof save our jobs, we must help the
-"workers of Rhodesia, Mexico, Peru and
Cliile-‘tor get the kind of wages that will
_ Vxméan —a' "decent standard of living. This

Win I213:-341- cents hike
at Highland Bellmine

BEAVERDELL, B. C.—Mine-Mill
Local 900, at the Highland Bell _mine
here, has won wage increases of from
12% to 34% -tents an hour after a
series of threats by the company and
covert attempts at bribery failed to
shake-the solidarity of the workers. ’
-‘The agreement followed a- strike
vote of ‘34 to, 5 in favor, after a long
period of grievances and provocations
through which the company sought to
divide the workers. Just before a gov-
ernment conciliation board came in, the
company madean offer to raise wages
in differing amounts ranging from 70

‘ cents to $1.67 per shift.

The majority report of the concilia-

 tion board then adopted this offer, do-

ing nothing on either statutory holi-
a"ys or union security. 7

GEORGE W. ANDERSON of Cop-
per Mountain, the union representative
on the board, recommended a $1.67
wage increase across the board,’ the
Sloan formula of union security, and
eight statutory holidays-

A letter was sent to each employee ,

of the Highland Bell mine by manager
0. S. Perry, stating the amunt of ret-
roactive pay—in two cases it came to
over $200—to be payable “immediately
after the abovei(wage) schedule and
other points are agreed upon by.a ma-
jority of the union members.”

“If, however, the company is forced

‘ DEER LODGE, Mont.—The Wage
Stabilization «Board has now approved
the wage increases won by Deer Lodge
Miners Union, Local ‘834, from the
Montana Phosphate Products Co. in the
last negotiations.

The wage increase is retroactive to
last July 1.‘ Therefore, any worker
' who has been on the company’s payroll
since last July 1, but is no longer work-

ing there, can “notify the company of _

his present address and request back

to suffer loss of production by strike
action,” continued Peri°y’s letter, “it
is regretted that it willpno longer be
in a position to pay either‘ retroactive
wages or holiday, pay above that au-
thorized by the Holiday Pay Act.”
This intimidatory letter was sent out
on March 29. The overwhelming vote
for strike on \April 4 gave Mr. Perry
his answer. " V .
FIRST DATE set for_ the stoppage
was April 14, but this was changed to

I

the 17th, atwhich date an attempt at —
Labor; Relations _

mediation by the
Board was commenced.

Perry blew up during the mediation
proceedings, and nothing came of the
April 17 meeting. But the secretary of
the mining association asked for an-
other meeting with " the mediation
boardand the union the next day dur-
ing which the settlement proposal was
devised. 2

After the breakup the day before,
Perry phoned the mine and ordered
all equipment removed and the cook-
houses and bunkhouses to be padlocked
the following Monday. One day was

lost replacing equipment, following

the settlement. *

The pay increases are retroactive to»

November 1, 1951, and the eight sta-
tutory holidays demanded by the union
were also won. Increases amount to
an average of'20 cents" an hour, .

The local bargaining committee con-» I

sisted‘ of president Stien Smith, sec-
retary-treasurer Jim Socket, L. Cag-
ney, Martin DeVries, Pete Thor, Adrian

Berchtold, Ed Woods, and Ray Bow- .

cout, with Everett Lundberg as chair-
man and Gordon Hammond as secre-
tary. Ken Smith, president of the B. C.
District Union, assisted materially.

ANIZE N

By norms WRIGHT
T BISBEE, Ariz.——This is an old mining camp, known to many‘
iMin‘e-Mill members throughout the West. It is a strong union town,
.and it’s going to be stronger with the addition of a new bargaining
unit to Copper Queen‘Miners Union, Local 551. /V

 Some 200 men are atwork here with churn drills, bulldozers,
powershovels and trucks, remaking the landscape into the form of an

open pit mine. It is a Phelps Dodge operation.
' The ‘_Copper-- Queen underground mines represent an older part of

the” P-D empire. C A g .

-..,vi

« will become. a huge hole “with the

:'formation of the_Lavender pit. A ’
highway, U. S. 80, will be re-'

.  built ‘around it. i
V So far the work is mainlyithat
by _ of removing overburden. Crews

are operating at a number of A

points, including the rim of an

"old pit, unworkedsince 1929, which will :

.- C‘ e be a part of the new and much larger
r_’ mine. Employment is expected to reach
’300. to’400 before theuend of the year. ’

'- the new property. They predict that

’ - jithis group will soon ‘be added to the
.—Mine-Mill bargaining strength with
‘P-D. A ' ‘

 '.An election petition has been filed.

_'_-by‘ Mine-Mill. Also‘ intervening in the

‘ election are several AFL craft unions,’

‘plus ‘Jack Deversiwith an AFL federal’

local which exists only on paper. But_;_

  ,the AFL unions so far have not ‘sent
’ __.a»single organizer in here.”

- Correction of bad working conditions‘

jjand flag/rant‘ grievances is one of the

principal interests of the pit workersf

»The Mine-Mill organizers are pointing

"out our union’s record in correcting
wconditions and. settling ‘grievances in
U’ ﬂE_i;he Copper Queen branch of P-D and

.Wherever we hold bargaining rights.

One of the major beefs of the pit

V ‘Workersis dust. Measures which could

_ ‘- _-be taken to control dust are ignored by

it-9  the company. . '

: THERE ARE NO seniority rights in

g f the new P-D pit, and no real classifica-
-tion of jobs. Men are moved around

from one occupation to another, forced‘

to fill in on almost any kind of work.
This is‘ especially bad where small oper-

l

i  A MOST or THE AREA between the towns of Bisbee and Lowell

ations are being carried on at a num-

..ber of separate places.-

It is a regular company practice to
chisel on the 30-minute lunch period.
Men are forced to return to work with-
out enough time to eat.

Bosses commonly jump onialtruck or‘
other piece of equipment, highball it /

for a few minutes, then jump off, tell-
ing the Worker on the job: “You can do
it the same as _I did. Now do it.”_

Men are fired for no reason except
the whim of a boss. ‘

IN CONTRAST to the Mine-Mill pro-
gram of ending these conditions and
setting up a strong grievance proced-
u_re,_ ‘the’ AFL spokesmen talk about
the journey—man’s card which sup-

V .posedly'will guarantee a job in another

camp.

-“The majority want to know what a
unionicando to correct conditions right
hereand now, and make this a good

" :.-'place to work,” Brother Claude Allen

explained. “They know that Mine-Mill
is a union that fights for the _workers.
And that’s the kind 0 of union they
want.”

’Bisbee, Arizona, is a name well

known in labor history. A" militant -

local ‘union of the Western Federation
of O. Miners (predecessor to Mine—Mill)_
‘V went on strike in Bisbee in 1917. The
employer at. 1 that time was Phelps
.Dodge, operating mines now closed.-

The 1917- strike was broken in one
of the most brutal attacks ‘on record.
, Using hundreds -of hired f‘deputies”
and other gunmen, company agents
rounded up the strikers at gun point,
‘forced them into freight cars, locked
them in,.hauled them hundreds of miles
away, and dumped _them out on_ the
New Mexico desert ,without food’ or
water. They were warned not to re-
turn or they would be shot on sight.
3 Many of these miners had homes
and families in Bisbee. Their tax
money had helped build its streets,/
schools and utilities. ‘

The company broke the strike of
1917, but. later tl1e.union returned‘ and
made Bisbee a decent place to live and
work That struggle goes forward now
