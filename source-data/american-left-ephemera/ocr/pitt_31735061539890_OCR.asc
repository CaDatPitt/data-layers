which joined the Communist Party of Germany (at
that time the Spartakus Bund),. until its /split in
March, 1920. Luxemburg, the leader of the “Left-
-radicals”, who gained revolutionary prestige during
war time, was acting chairman of the Soviet of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies (formed on a party
basis  of representatives of three parties and of
the trade unions) and carried on a menshevist policy
in the Soviet. Under such confused circumstances
it was no wonder that the attractive power of the
Communist Party of Germany in Hamburg was not
particularly great among -the best sections of the
working class. ’

Upon his return from the war, Ernst Thaelmann
intentionally remained in the ranks of the Indepen-
dent Social-Democratic*Party, with the idea of going

over to the Communist Party of Germany, not by’

himself alone, but with as many comrades as
possible. -He did not limit himself to the systematic
and stubborn struggle against the Right leaders of
the Independent Social-Democratic Party. Together
with other sincere, revolutionary ‘functionaries he was
constantly involved in struggle, often above the heads
of the Central Committee elements who were afraid
of struggle in accordance with the course of events.
We quote a few examples: ‘

l9l9 in Hamburg

In the- middle of January, 1919, in Bremen,
Noske’s agents -were" kicked out of the Soviet of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, and workers’ armed
platoons were set up. In vain did Noske threaten
and in vain did he send a division to the Lower

10

  

   

    

   

Weser at the end of January. The revolutionary
workers sensed that after the January massacre in
Berlin it would constitute the beginning of a counter-

revolutionary drive throughout the country. Tele- '

grams of protest showered in torrents on Ebert,
Scheidemann, Noske. The Soviet of Soldiers’ Depu-
ties of the Twelfth Army Corps, which had its seat
in Hamburg-Altona, threatened to come to and ren-
der armed assistance to Bremen. The miners of the
Ruhr threatened a strike. 0

. With the determined armed suppor-t of Hamburg,
the “Herstenberg division” sent by Noske to Bremen
could easily have been crushed. This example would
have kindled the fire of revolutionary struggle
throughout the country. And it was precisely for
this reason, in order to avert this decisive step, that
the Hamburg social-democratic leaders transformed
the -Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies into
an endless talking shop. The leaders of the Inde-
pendents (Right) and Laufenberg caught the bait.
While debates and controversies were renewed on
February 3, debates which lasted until late at night,
about 1,000 Independent and Communist workers,
under the leadership of Ernst Thaelmann proceeded
to the barracks, and armed themselves so as to go
to the aid of their brothers in Bremen. The news of
such an “independent” act exploded like a bomb-
shell at the session of the Soviet. The session was
adjourned. In the meantime the armed workers
were already marching to the railway’ station. But
Noske’s agents sabotaged their departure by all pos-
sible means. Thus only part of the workers suc-
ceeded in reaching Bremen, and their action failed in
its purpose. Despite the heroic resistance of the work-

11‘

 

  

ers, Noske’s troops seized Bremen on February 4.
~ Bremen. was followed by Central Germany, then
by Berlin‘ once more, then by the Ruhr, \Wuerttem-

» berg and Bavaria. Noske’s White bandits gradually

 

restored bourgeois “peace and law and order”, after
brutally murdering 15,000 German workers.- In
Hamburg in June, 1919, the guard detachments, the
last bearers of arms of the November Revolution,
were replaced by absolutely reliable police oﬂicers.
The voluntary detachments composed of the sons of
the bourgeoisie were brought to full readiness. The
exposures of the vile doings in the Hamburg Food
Supply apparatus gave rise to big workers’ demon-
strations. It was then discovered that the guard de-
tachments, who were threatened with dissolution,
were unﬁt for struggle against the workers. The
voluntary detachment attacked the demonstrators,
but it was smashed by the workers who had promptly
procured arms. Then the social-democratic govern-
ment of the Free City of Hamburg called in the help
of the imperial executive power, i.e., of Noske.

The revolutionarycircles of the workers ﬁrmly re-
jected the idea of immediately accepting the chal-
lenge to fight Noske’s White gangs, which had in
the meantime grown st-upendously. T-hen, news was
received that ‘a regiment 0 of North German troops
was marching on Hamburg. When the regiment
entered the city, the alarmed workers with their
wives and children filled the streets, and closely fol-
lowed the troops, talking with them in the local
dialect and explaining the real state of affairs in
Hamburg to the soldiers who had been deceived by
all kinds of fables about the horrors being perpe-
trated there. Ernst Thaelmann -was busy in the

12

 

  

  

midst of the throng. He himself entered into con-
versation with the soldiers, and at the same time gave
instructions to the active workers who were con-
tinuously going and coming. The soldiers had not
expected such a reception. They began to waver.
Their train got stuck near the Main Station, and
soon the arms voluntarily surrendered by the sol-
diers found their way to the hands of the workers,
men and women. The ofﬁcers were helpless, and
they left the city with the almost completely disarmecl
soldiers. Then Noske drew a great number of troops
to Hamburg, and in a week’s time these troops seized

the city at sunrise.

Under the leadership of Ernst Thaelmann, the
Hamburg Independent workers, almost without ex-
ception, joined the Communist Party of Germany in
1920. Only a handful of petty-bourgeois elements
remained outside, who very‘ soon dissolved in the
Social-Democratic Party. Ernst Thaelmarm ’ was a
member of the Regional Committee of the Com-
munist Party of Germany and chairman of its Ham-
burg organiza=tion. V

Severing’s offensive against the workers of Cen-

if tral Germany received a rebuif from the revolution-

    

ary workers of Hamburg. The police were on the
point of cutting off‘ the road taken by the workers
who were marching from the wharves. The police
opened up machine-gtm ﬁre upon the masses. But
in spite of the obstacles which barred the streets,
tens of thousands demonstrated ‘in the very heart of
the city. An officer shouted the order to disperse,
from the turret of an armored car which cut straight
into the masses. But the workers did not retreat. And
it was Ernst Thaelrnarm who was marching in the

13

 

 
 

front ranks, coolly deiiberating on how to repulse this
police provocation. - . ’ ‘

Leads the Struggle for a Mass Bolshevik Pan-’ry

Ernst Thaelmann indisputably came to the fore-
front in all the economic and political ﬁghts of the
Hamburg proletariat. He represents the type of
proletarian leader who has grown up in theprocess
of revolutionary struggles, and who is always close-
ly bound up with the thoughts and feelings of his
class. The great conﬁdence which the class‘-conscious
workers had in him extended far beyond the con-
fines of the Hamburg organization of‘ the Communist
Party of Germany, and helped him in "his struggle
to transformthe Communist Party of Germany into
atrue Bolshevik mass Party.

‘_‘The tragedy of the German revolution in 1-918,
of the January battles in 1919, of the battles in
1920 after the Kapp putsch, of the March battles
'in 1921 and up to the last upsurge of the acute
revolutionary situation, of this first period in Oc-
tober, 1923, consisted, on one hand, in the lack of
co-ordination between the objectively matured revo-
lutionlary situation, and on the other hand in the
subjective weakness of the German proletariat, due
to the absence of the purposeful Bolshevik Party.”
(Thaelmann, Militant Speeches and Articles.)

The fact that he understood this already deter-' "

mined Ernst Thaelmarm’s action in the years 1921-;
1923 against Brandler and the then opportunist policy
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of Germany, and against the “Left” deviations of
Urbans, who was then the chairman of the Maritime
organization of the Communist Party of Germany. '

From the period of the Unity Congress" of 1920,
Ernst Thaelmann was the representative of the Ham-
burg. organization in the Supreme. Control Com-
mission.-of the Communist Party of Germany, whose
duty it was to check the work of the Central Com-
mittee in the intervals between the congresses. In
June, 1921, Thaelmann came as delegate -to the
Third Congress of the Comintern, and, as later at the
Jena Congress of the_Germa_nCommunist ‘Party, he
took. an active part in the discussions and in the

‘preparation of the resolutions, which separated the

policy of the Party both from the renegade Levi
group and from the "theoreticians of the offensive”
of that time, Thalheimer, and others. _ A
The increasing inﬂation, the growth of the cost 0
living, and of -the burden" of taxation in 1922 not only
revolutionized the "working class with greater inten-
sity, but also assisted the first onslaught of the fascist
wave. On the night of June 19, 1922, swastika ter-
rorists attached two hand grenades to the window of
Ernst Thaelmarm’s living quarters which were situ-

_ated on the ground ﬂoor. Part of the apartment was

destroyed by the -explosion of the grenades, but the
main blow failed to affect the inside of the apart-
ment. The plot to destroy the leader of the Ham-
burg proletariat failed. ‘The social-democratic press
was -brazen enough to ‘assert that the attempt was
staged. However, when the fascist culprits were dis-
covered after further -attempts upon the Communist
Party headquarters and the Communist book store,
and were formally sentenced to imprisonment, the
social-democratic government of Hamburg reduced
the- sentences they received and soon released ‘them
altogether. '

Stands ‘For a Revoluﬁonary Policy in the
Trade Unions _

The events of 1923 were approaching. As early as
the Tenth Congress of the Transport Workers’
Union, held in Stuttgart in 1919, Ernst Thaelmann
declared that "it was impossible to eliminate political
questions from the trade unions”. The Hamburg
transport workers elected him in 1924 to represent
them at the Eleventh Congress’ of the union, which
convened in Berlin. Among other things, Ernst
Thaelmann stated the following at this Congress:

“It is true, that in the present circumstances the
economic struggles and strikes for wages are the
surest means to prevent the further worsening of
the conditions of the working class, but the char-

. acter of the trade union struggle must be extended
and changed. The struggle against the impover-
ishment of the masses cannot be conﬁned to eco-
nomic struggles alone. We _have every reason "to
state outright at the trade union congress that it
is not use expecting any measures in the interests of
the proletariat from the capitalist governments.
VVe have seen these last few days that Stinnes, as
the representative of capitalism and the big bour-
geoisie, has approached the government with a
ﬁrmly outlined program, while the A.D.G.B. [re-
formist German General Federation of Trade
Unions] replies to this with modest proposals and
weak- suggestions, which do not give the proletariat
the required practical improvement of their condi-
tions. In the last paragraph, the memorandum de-
mands from the German government, z'.e., from
the capitalist government, that a law or a decree
be issued forbidding all kinds of speculative.trans-
actions and establishing rigid control of prices

16

.‘.

iﬁxed by concerns and syndicates. But he who be-
lieves that a capitalist government is in a position
to do so has learned nothing since “I918.”

In this speech Comrade Thaelmann declared him-_
self for a revolutionary policy. in the tr-ade ‘union «

movement, a policy which does not stop before the
artiﬁcial obstacles of paragraphs’ ‘and clauses piled
up by the reformist bureaucracy—as was called for
by the legalist theses of Brandler and his adherents
—but, on the contrary, recognized the full importance
of struggle for the everyday interests and needs of
the proletariat. Ernst Thaelmann fought against the
absurd contention of the Brandler leadership in_l923
that it was necessary to put a brake on the partial
struggles of the proletariat—who were up in arms
against the ruinous consequences of the catastrophic
inﬂation—and that it was necessary -to put such a
brake on them so as to concentrate their revolution-
ary energy. Thaelmarm fought. against this as an
attempt to evade struggle altogether. October of
1923 soon proved how correct was his estimate of
the'Party leadership of that time. This is what Ernst
Thaelmann wrote about October 1923: '

“It was with incredible rapidity that in October,
1923, We approached the moment when the move-
ment burst through its narrow framework with
irrepressible, elemental force and generated the
supreme form of struggle, the uprising. An out-
right revolutionary situation -was present. All
the conditions requisite for the victory of the revo-
lutionary class were at hand, with the exception of
one, namely the existence of a clear, iron, mono-
lithic Communist Party, indissolubly bound to the
widest masses, and ready and capable of embracing

17

    

the spontaneous struggle of the working masses, of
organizing and leading it. _
“At the decisive hour, the leadership of our
Party proved to be bankrupt-
' “Our Party as a whole was- too unripe as yet to
‘prevent the mistakes of the leadership. Thus, in
autumn of 1923 the revolution suffered defeat due
to the absence of‘one of the most essential pre-
requisites, namely, because there was no Bolshevik
Party.”

And Thaelmann was able to add with full justice:

“But does this exhaust the whole history of
October, 1923? 7 No, not by any means! Later
again errors were committed in" resolutions and
articles, and even in the speeches made before the
bourgeois tribunal, in that reference was made to
-Saxony alone, when it was a question" of October,
.1923. But not only Saxony existed. There was
..}Iamburg as well. — _ ‘
“Hamburg corroborated the ‘Leninist thesis on a
very large scale, to the eﬁect that the movement
bursts through its narrow framework with irre-
T pressible ‘elemental force and generates the supreme
form of struggle, the uprising! As stated in the
Theses of the January Executive Committee in
1924, the Hamburg uprising was the opposite pole
to Saxony.” , _ - i ‘ '

' Draws Lessons of the ‘Hamburg —BaH'|es

Those, who seelnothing but bankruptcy, treachery,
and opportunismin the history of the whole of our
Party up -to Frankfurt, ‘forget the great lessons of
the Hamburg struggle. They forget- that the rank
and file of our Party by no means remained ina
state of passive impotence, but were ready to stake

their lives in the struggle for power. The Hamburg
workers, more than all others," can declare that not
only the Hamburg workers, but the Berlin, Saxonian,
and all other Communist workers in Germany ex-

, pressed their readiness ‘for the struggle.

And we can add, that the heroic October battles
of the Hamburg proletariat would not have been
possible without the many-years of struggle by Ernst
Thaelmarm for the introduction of Bolshevik clarity,
for internal and external consolidation of the forces
of the Hamburg Organization of the 'Communist
Party of Germany; - "

The Hamburg example made it possible to rapidly

. overcome the spirit of depression and dejection which

prevailed in connection with the October defeat. The
illegal Communist Party persistently called for a
change of the opportunist ‘Party leadership. And
from this period Ernst Thaelmann takes his place
at the head of the Communist‘ Party and strives for
the realization of the point which he formulates as
the “Lessons of the Hamburg Uprising”, on one of
his programmatic articles. We quote herein below
the following lines from his article: '

“In order to gain victory in the inevitably im-
’ pending "repetition of the Hamburg battles, but
on a much larger‘ scale, we must imbed ourselves,
in the masses, and bind» ourselves to them by‘
thousands of threads, creating a genuinely prole-
tarian united front with the millions" of workers.
1 A great revolutionary Wing must grow up in the
trade unions, and in all the non-Party organiza-
- tions of_ the working class, which jointly with
the Communists will become the bearer of the '
' oncoming battles; A '

“The seizure of power by the proletariat is not
the act of a single moment. It consistts not only
of a military struggle against the army of the
bourgeoisie, but must be prepared by years of
work carriedon by the Communist Party and the
whole proletariat. The future conquerors of the
bourgeoisie must be educated, trained and or-
ganized in countless partial struggles. Such is our
chief task at the present period. ‘

“The Hamburg ﬁghters enjoyed_the full sym-
pathy of the workers in the enterprises, but they
had no organizational links with these Workers.
The entire inadequacy, the fatal backwardness of
our old social-democratic organization. according
to the territorial principle, stood revealed. The
election machine is of no use for barricades. The
biggest gap in the Hamburg ﬁghting front was
the absence of Communist nuclei in the factories
and mills.” ‘

Fighting "on Two Fronts

The Bolshevization of the Communist Party of
Germany soon called for struggle against the Ruth

.. Fisher and Maslow ‘groupings, these petty bourgeois,

who hid behind “Left” phrases, and who, by their
sectarian line, prevented the Party from waging a
struggle for the majority of the working class. Ernst
Th‘aelmann’s great merit lies in the fact that, inthe
full consciousness of his purpose, he struggled ﬁrmly
and stubbornly against this sectarian group, thus en-
suring its rapid liquidation. In his ﬁght on two
fronts, against the "-Left” and the Right deviations,
Ernst Thaelmann succeeded in consolidating the
Bolshevization of .the Communist Party of Germany
to an ever greater degree. In 1928 he successfully

20

 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
    

repulsed the‘ attempt of the Brandlerites, who had
the support -of the conciliatory elements, to gain in-
ﬂuence in the Party leadership with a view to re-
ducing the role of the Communist Party in the class
struggle of the German proletariat and to forcing
the Communist Party to follow the lead of social-
democracy and -the trade union bureaucrats.
Thaelmann, the pilot of the Communist Party of
Germany, took the helm ever more ﬁrmly into his
hands, and elevated the Communist Party of Ger-
many to the level of a mass Party for which six mil-
lion German wofkingmen and women voted at the
elections. It was only under his leadership that the
Communist Party of Germany grew into a Bolshevik.
mass Party and found its way to the Leninis-t policy
of the united front, to the policy_ of the revolu-
tionary trade union movement, of the independent
leadership of the struggles of. the working class. It
is only un-der his leadership that the Communist
Party of Germany has fought a ainst the treacherous
policy of social-democracy, an with ever growing
success has fought for the winning over of the
social-democratic workers, our class comrades, and
has learned more and more to master the. problems
of correctly estimating social-fascism and fascism,
and of the alliance of the workers and peasants.

Upon Ernst Thaelm*ann’s proposal, the Central
Committee issued a ﬁery programmatic declaration in
August 1930 on the “social and national liberation
of the German people”, a platform which proved to
be a terrible weapon in the struggle against the na-
tionalist demagogy of Hitlerite' fascism, as well -as
against the entire nationalist policy of the bourgeoisie
and of social-democracy. And even now this platform

21

-.~..;.4.n::.-..~‘-,;=4 ' ‘A’ .~—* *4 ‘ "   ‘ ‘

   

"serves again and again in the underground publica-

tions of the Communist Party of Germany as a guide
showing the masses the road to emancipation through
the establishment of Soviet Power.

The very fact that whenever Thaelmann under-
took a tour, tens of thousands always gathered to
hear Ernst Thaelmann, the leader of the_ Communist
Party and the leader of the Red Front Fighters (the
organization prohibited by Severing-but neverthe-
less still continuing to exist), is undoubted proof of
their conﬁdence in the Communist Party of Ger-
many, of their sympathy for Soviet Power, of their
desire to follow the great revolutionary example of
the workers and peasants of the U.S.S.R. At the
same time, the workers knew, or understood by in-
stinct, that the‘ leader of the German _Communist

' Party is one of their own in the best sense of-this

word, ﬂesh of the ﬂesh of the working class, bound
closely» and directly to the working masses. Thael-
mann perceived and caught on to every least little
movement among the masses. This political sense,
his understanding and knoweldge of the life of the
workers, clearly combined with ‘theoretical clarity, as
well as his intrepidity and bravery in the political
struggle, made Ernst Thaelmann the leader of the
German proletariat.

Takes Determined Course for Independent
Leadership otiEconomic Struggles G

In 1928 and 1929 the German Communist Party
took a most determined course for the independent
waging of economic struggle in ruthless struggle
against social-fascism.

22

 

 

The Comintern and the Proﬁntern in those years
anticipated the forthcoming world economic crisis.
Bourgeois “scientists” and the reformists, blinded by
the prolonged “stabilization” of market conditions,
started to talk about “crisisless economy”. At the Kiel
Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany,
Hilferding spoke of the period of peaceful transition
from capitalism to socialism, of‘ the growing stability
of economic conditions, declaring that the economic
crisis was of less danger; and that due to the greater
planning of capitalist economy the workers were
being less and less affected by it. At the Hamburg

-Congress of -trade unions, Naftali sang the praises of

“economic democracy” as a form of the peaceful co-
existence of the employers and the workers.

In constrast to these prophecies the Communist
International. predicted the oncoming crisis, and
orientated the tactics of the Communist Party to
meet this period of crisis.

The Brandlerites and the conciliators inside the
C.P., on the other hand, were up in arms against
the theses of the Six-th Congress of the Comintern
regarding the shattering and the approaching end of
temporary stabilization. They also turned down the
tactical conclusions, particularly those drawn in the
sphere of trade union work.

Despite the strongest opposition of Brandler and.
Thalheimer, and ignoring the personal attacks made-

by the Brandlerites and conciliators, Ernst Thaelmann
fought both these groupings without mercy. The
Communist Party of Germany came out with Red
revolutionary lists at the elections of the factory
committees: the revolutionary trade union opposition
came into being.
' 23

  

Bureaucrats Expel Thaelmann from the
Transport Union

When success was attained in ﬁrmly consolidating
the revolutionary .trade union opposition under the
leadership of the Communist Party, the trade union
bureaucrats of the Central Transport Workem Union
seized this opportunity on March 18, 1931, to expel
Ernst Thaelmann from the union. to which he had

belonged for 28 years. But if it was formerly con-

sidered the grea-test disgrace among the workers to -be
expelled from a -workers’ organization, the reformist
defenders of the capitalist order have long since
turned this disgrace into a supreme honor by expel-
ling revolutionary workers in masses. In his reply
to the letter informing him of his expulsion, Ernst

. Thaelmann wrote, among other things, that the

 

, “Bureaucracy, now dominating and violating
the gigantic organizations of the German prole-
tariat, has been forming in the trade unions for
decades. This «bureaucracy feels itself independent
of the will of the wide masses of members.
These bureaucrats have secured their we1l—paid
jobs for life; they have blood-bonds with capital-
ism, with the capitalist State.

“But anybody who does not want to ﬁght against
this system, must also oppose the economic strike
and must become a scab on principle. Such is ‘the
iron logic of capitalist development. Such is the
course of German reformism. ’

“The revolutionary trade union opposition‘
springs up as a force which will restore the strong-_
hold against exploitation which has been destroyed
by the trade union bureaucracy. A new force is_
springing up from factories, from mines, from
construction jobs, and landed estates, which makes

24

 

  

it its object to create powerful organizations
against the employers and fascism. The revolu-
tionary trade union opposition is once more re-
generating the best traditions of the trade union
class struggle in Germany which is over sixty
years of age. The revolutionary trade union op-
position wishes to and must4—and this is its duty
before the German Working class—restore the class
front, which you have destroyed.”

Those who expelled Ernst Thaelmarm have long
since been thrown overboard, after having cleared
the road for fascism. This has only been the case
if they -did not promptly and. openly rush to the
fascist “ground of real facts” and did not become
I-Iitler’s chained dogs, in the same way as when they
wagged their tails before all former capitalist gov-
ernments of Germany, wearing dog-collars with the
legend of the “lesser evil”. As an organized parlia-
mentary party they were thrown overboard together
with all the forms of bourgeois-demorcatic parlia-
mentarism, which once yielded plenty of advantages
to the bourgeoisie, and have now become a hindrance
to it. But -the masses of -social-democratic workers,
who long before Hitler’ s advent -to power were torn
with doubts, but could not decide to make an organ-
izational break with their party, are now learning
from their own experience that the liberation of the
working class is possible by revolutionary means alone.
This was pointed out to them by the Communist
Party of Germany headed by Ernst Thaelm-arm, and
is the path which the Party will pursue in the future
as the vanguard of the German ‘proletariat, until vic-
tory has been secured over the fascist dictatorship
and until Soviet Germany has been established, de-
spite all stupendous sacriﬁces.

25

    

    

Thaelmann Shows the Way -How fo Struggle
Againsf Fascism

The first big electoral victory of the Nationa_l-So-
cialist Party in September," 1930, signalized the
growth of the fascist danger in Germany. The social-
democrats, Brandlerites and Trotzkyites declared the
fascist dictatorship to be the dictatorship of the petty
bourgeoisie. What was needed here was complete
clari-ty introduced as sharply as possible. In his
report to the Plenum of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of Germany on January 15,
1931,.Ernst Thaelmann said:

“Wherein lies the class content of the idea of
the fascist dictatorship? If we examine this prob-
lem We discover that the class content of the fas-
cist dictatorship is undoubtedly the dictatorship of
ﬁnance capital, just as is bourgeois democracy.
That is to say, it is not theclass content that has
changed, but only the methods. The‘forms of
domination are changed, and not the content of
this domination.” A

How to struggle against fascism? There is only
one force that can beat down and smash fascism, and
this is the force of the working class united under
revolutionary leadership.

“In our resolution we point out that the revolu-
tionary policy of the united front represents the
main link in proletarian policy in Germany. Com-

. rades, this formulation is of great weight. We
have chosen it after ripe deliberation, so as to
stress the ever-growing importance of the revolu-
tionary policy of the united front from below
for the development of the mass struggle and

26

to strengthen the prerequisites of the revolutionary
crisis in Germany.” (Thaelmann, The Revolution-
ary Way Out and the C.P.G.—German edition.)

The nationalist  social demagogy of the na-
tional-socialists had -to be exposed with the greatest
energy. The masses had to be shown that the Nazis
are the party of ﬁnance capital, establishing a regime
of ‘bloody terror‘ against the working class in the
interests of the moneybags. Ernst Thaelmann stated
in the same report: " '

“It is. only by bringing to the consciousness of
the masses of the employees, petty bourgeoisie,
oﬂicials and rural population, who are the main
mass of adherents of Hitlerite fascism, that it is
not national-socialism, but we, who are the only
Party‘ in which millions of ﬁghters are struggling
for the emancipation of Germany from the Ver-

. .sailles yoke‘ and capitalist bondage, and from the
enslavement of the Young Plan, that We will be-
come their deliverers, and win them to the side
of the class struggle.” ~

But the German_ working‘ class will be able to
struggle successfully against fascism only insofar as .
the Communist Party will succeed in destroying the
mass inﬂuence of ‘social-democracy. The following
excerpt from the same report still remains a practical
guide for immediate action:

“We must create a clear understanding of the
fact that it is impossible to smash.Hitler’s party,
without smashing the mass inﬂuence of social-
democracy, particularly among the proletariat. We
must achieve a clear understanding of the fact
that it will be impossible to overcome a possible
future government of Hitler, unless, in good time,

27

 

 

We direct the main blow against social-democ-
racy for the purpose of winning over the most
important strata of the working class. For it is
precisely social—democracy‘ which is catching or is
already holding the Wide masses of the Working
class captive in the interests of the bourgeoisie,
and is thereby evading the class struggle, or com-
ing out directly against it.”

Inthe spring of 1932, three candidates were nom-H

inated for the post of president of the German Re-
public: Hindenburg, Thaelmarm, and Hitler. In
this election Thaelmann embodied the united ﬁghting
front of the German proletariat. Even the workers,
who. for one or another reason gave their votes to
Hindenburg, were forced to see in Ernst Thaelmann
the candidate of the German proletariat. His tour
throughout Germany during the electoral campaign

‘ was a special kind of triumph of‘ the idea of the

united front.

The Pro1'es+ of the Wor|.d.Workers

Can Save Thaelmann

During the first days and weeks of Hitler’s advent
to power the Welses ‘and Leiparts did all they could
to betray the gigantic organizationof German work-
ers to the arbitrary will of fascism and thus to secure
for themselves a warm spot in the sun of the Third
Empire. The Welses and Leiparts negotiated with
Goering and Frick. This was at the time when Ernst
Thaelmann was arrested.

There is not asingle wor/aer’s dwelling in Ger-
many, not a single enterprise, where the terrible tor-
tures and -mockery exercised by the fascist /rangmen

. over near friends, comrades of each worker, have not

28

 

sown indelibly ﬁerce hatred against the fascists, and
where the proletarians are not suffering fears for the
life of one dear and near to them.

During the whole of these fourteen months that
the fascis-t beasts have held our Ernst Thaelmann in

’ their clutching talons, the anxious question as to

what is the latest regarding Ernst Thaelmann never
ceases to be uttered. This question is asked not only
by Communists who are alarmed about the fate of
their favorite leader. This question is being and has
been asked with no less sympathy by members of
the Reichsbarmer, with whom ‘we have chanced to
discuss either the joint anti-fascist struggle or their
joining the Communist Party of Germany. This
question has been asked by the social-democratic com-
rades, workers  whose apartments we have fre-
quently found shelter, -and felt ourselves safest when
hiding from the fascist police. Nor did this question
cease to sound even when the brave speeches of Com-
rade Dimitroﬁ at the Leipzig trial made the hearts
of millions of German toilers beat faster. In this
question we hear the alarm not for the life and health
of one man, but the alarm for -.the true genuine
leader of the Communist Party of Germany, reﬂect-
ing the fact that both the social~democratic workers,
and the millions of all the toilets who are not in-
clined towards fascism, place their only hope in the
Communist Party of Germany, which no brutal,
bloody terror will succeed in throttling.

When speaking about ‘Bolshevik cadres at the
Wedding Congress of the Communist Party of Ger-
many, soon after the blood bath organized by Zoer-
giebel, Comrade Thaelmann cal-led for the

ERNST THAELMANN  
The Leader of ihe German Workers

By R. GROETZ
FR¢M time immemorial -the city of_ Hamburg,

where‘ Ernst Thaelmann was born, has been a"
city of the most. acute class contradictions. The
grandfathers of the present shipowners took advan-
tage of the convenient situation of the port of Ham-
burg to sec-ure themselves stupendous super-proﬁts
at the expense of the hinterland, at the expense of
localities 'far removed from the sea. The Hamburg
patricians competed with the Dutch in the African
slave trade,  in supplying alcohol to the colonial
peoples . and ‘robbing them‘. And the Draconian
regulations regarding naval service, the Draconian
system of ﬁning, which remained valid in the Weimar
Republic even after the November Revolution, helped
them to exploit the sailors. Their most usual deal
was to send good-.for-nothing, heavily insured "ﬂoat-
ing coﬂins” to sea precisely in anticipation of their
loss at sea and the subsequent receipt of high insur-
ance premiums. These exploiters of hired slaves at
the same time’ speculated in real estate; the prole-
tarians of the port were stifled in slums near the
wharves which attained a sad world fame for the
terriﬁc cholera epidemics which broke out there.

The Hamburg exploiters V tried on one hand to
bribe and subject the army of trading employees to

3

   

“. L . greatest readiness in our own ranks to
make sacriﬁces not only in the political but also
in the material_.sphere.-C In the struggle against
our‘ class enemy, we must defend our positions to
the very end. Not a single Communist should leave
the post assigned to him by the Party, Even in
the conditions of the most bitter struggle we must
fulﬁll our revolutionary duty without hesitation.”

In letters of blood written in the annals of history,
the Communist Party of Germany has given proof
that the prerequisites for -the fulﬁllment of the tasks
of the Bolshevik Party are stil-l alive within it. The
merit of having forged- the steeled and tempered
Communist Party ‘of Germany belongs in the first

place to Ernst Thaelmann who, by his conduct in

the torture chamber of the secret police as well, sets

' an example to the revolutionary "workers. _The fascist

henchmen of German monopolist capital, overcome
with the lust for revenge at the heroicstruggle of
German Communists against the ’ Hitlerite dictator-
ship which is more and more losing ground in the
midst of political and economic gdiﬂiculties, wish to
makes an end of Ernst Thaelmann, ‘to wreak their
vengeance on him. In the person -of, its great and
intrepid leader, they want to deal a blow at the Com-
munist Party of. Germany and to sow downhearted-
ness in the ranks of its heroic ﬁghters. Only the

further development and intensiﬁcation of -the anti-’

fascist mass struggle and the protest of the many mil-
lions of the proletariat throughout the world can save
the life of Ernst Thaelmann and the lives of the
thousands of ‘revolutionary workers ‘who are wasting
away in the torture chambers of the fascist butchers.

their arbitrary will by means of delusion: the pros-
pect that they might become merchants, or reach
the highest oﬂice posts. On the other hand it was
with ruthless force that these exploiters used the en-
tire apparatus of the Free City of Hamburg against
the struggling workers. 1 '

After the bitter struggles lost by the workers due
to the reformist trade union leadership in 1896,
1906, and 1911, the shipowners and the metallurgical
magnates established a monopoly in the hiring of
labor power, which the exploiters throughout the
whole of Germany tok as a model. This system was
established for the purpose of purging the enterprises
of class ﬁghters and of attracting to Hamburg a re-
serve army of labor which beats down wage rates.

Hamburg's Tradiﬁons Betrayed

Hamburg was proud of its long time traditions as 3
"bulwark of the _labor movement”. Such names as ‘‘
Weitlmg, I-Ieib, York, Hasenklewer, Ignatz Auer,

Jakob Auderf, and others, and later on Bebel, were

connected with the history of the Hamburg working

class movement. But the house decorated with the

old and faded laurels has long since become a house
contaminated with the ulcer of reformism. Fossilized ‘
old men dominated in the party, and strange as it

may sound, they were still regarded as Left ﬁghters

in many parts of Germany. They were so regarded 4
despite the fact that, for instance, after serious

clashes with the police, they reduced -to naught and

disrupted the struggle against the brazen offensive

upon suﬂirage rights (1906) by their declarations

that in principle they respected all the‘ laws of the

bourgeois state. I

The squabbles and bickerings between the social-
democratic bureaucracy and the bureaucrats of trade
union and co-operative movements were settled in
secret as far as possible. Efforts were made to wash
their dirty linen at home. All attempts to spread
discussion on burning questions were very rapidly
suppressed as obnoxious infringements of order. The
far-famed “party education” section disposed of
cheap wares at classes and in talks. The publication
of a series of pamphlets, including The Mass Strike
by Rosa Luxemburg, and the Path to Power by
Kautsky, which the Lefts in Germany credited so
undeservedly to the philistines in the Central Com-
mittee, bore no fruitful inﬂuence over the mass of
members, insofar as the scornful name of “literary
bickerings” was permanently and regularly attached
to the controversies and disagreements in the country
which prevailed between the Lefts, the Centrist bog,
and the Revisionists in Hamburg. The standard was
very low.

When war policy exposed the German Social-
Democratic Party as the social insurance of the bour-
geoisie against the proletarian revolution, the organ
of the Hamburg social-democrats became the central
organ of the “re-educaters”. Social-patriotism and
social-imperialism raged in its columns.

This cursory review of the history of the labor
movement in Hamburg explains why the factors,
which during and after the war handicapped the
formation of the Communist" Party, had a particu-
larly strong inﬂuence precisely in Hamburg, and
shows how great are the merits of Ernst Thaelmann
in solving this problem. ‘

  

A Revoluﬁonisf at an Early Age

Ernst Thaelmann was born in_ Hamburg on April
17, 1886. Even during the period of the anti-socialist
law his_ father belonged to social-democracy. Already,
at the age of 16, Ernst Thaelmarm became a mem-
ber of the Social-Democratic Party, and at -the age

_ of 17 joined the German Transport Workers’ Union.

 

Ernst began work first in the port, then he was a
sailor, and later he -worked on transport. 'He began
to fulﬁll responsible functions in the Party and in
the trade union movement early in‘ life. When he
had to fulﬁll’ military service he already had the
reputation of being a “politically unreliable fellow”,
who did not recognize his fatherland. VAs a.revolu-
tionary social-democrat, he ‘had to suﬁer all the
mockery of Prussian militarism. ‘

When he ﬁnished his military service, Ernst T~hael-
mann -became a member of the Transport Workers’
Committee and later a representative of the Ham-
burg Trade Union Council. At the same time he
was successively the first organizer in the laundry
drivers section, member of the drivers’ branch com-
mittee, leader‘. of the Dockers’ Branch and a re-
porter- of the Hamburg Bureau of the trade union.

In 1912, the Hamburg transport workers dele-
gated Ernst Thaelmarm to the Eighth Congress in
Breslau, where he made a speech against the reduc-
tion of the trade unions to the role of relief agencies
and against the growing pretensions of the upper
trade union bureaucracy.

“It has been mentioned further, that district fees
are to be ra_ised from ﬁve to ten pfennigs. I con-
sider this excessive. The district leaders should try

6

 

  

to cut down their expenses. . . . As regards doles,
I will point out that our organization is becoming
more a relief organization than an organ of strug- ‘
gle. This should not be so.”

Resolution No. 27 called for a further curtailment
of the rights of trade union‘ members and proposed
-that in’ deﬁnite cases the right of settling questions
should be given to the “local committee” disregard’-
ing the local membership meeting’s power to make
decisions. Thaelmann declared: ' .

“I move that motion 27 be turned down as the
local committee cannot enjoy such conﬁdence and
the members of the organization sometimes have a
quite different opinion than the committee.”

Fights for Youths in Trade Unions

It was not the political acumen of the social-
democratic and trade union leaders that created the
youth organization in Germany, but exclusively the
initiative of the exploited youth who received sup-
port from Karl Liebknecht and other representatives
of the Left. Wing. And it was only later that the
social-democratic leaders began to interest themselves
in the youth in their own way, their only care being

that they should. not -perpetrate‘ any political “stupid- _

. ities”. It was only under -the pressure of the mass"

of the membership that the‘ trade union leaders pro-
ceeded to create youth sections, in the trade unions.
Ernst Thaelmann and the revolutionary youth of his
circle rallied to the general meetings of the Transport
Workers’ Union first 300, and later about 1,800
young workers. Finally the reformist bureaucracy

resorted to repression against this revolutionary

7

   

youth section. At the Breslau Congress in 1.912
Ernst Thaelmann stated:

“We have youth sections only in Berlin and Ham-
burg. And we still need to plough this ﬁeld. The
young people in our trade are left to their own
devices more than in the qualiﬁed trades. This is
the reason why much more should be done for the

. yout_h. . . . I consider it unjust that, despite higher
membership fees, the youth should be given less
rights than the adults, and I move that this point
he rejected.”

At the_Nintl_1 Congress of the Transport Workers’ C

Union in 1914, held in Cologne, Ernst Thaelmann
again spoke in favor of the election of trade union
officials by the members of the union, in favor of the

_ elective principle in the trade unions, against trans-

ferring discussions and decisions to the narrow bu-
reaucratically limited circle of functionaries, and
against the neglect of the masses of the members and

for short-time wage agreements.

The reformist trade’ unon bureaucracy, who for
the sake of appearance, waged a sham struggle
against the employers, attempted to -bribe the young
revolutionary, and so did the employers. The owner
of a large laundry establishment, for example, of-
fered Ernst Thael-mann a permanent position if
only he ceased his ?‘undermining work” in the capa-
city of the chairman of the workers’ committee. By
his rejection of this ditty transaction, Ernst Thael-
mann gained the honor of being included in the
employers’ black list, and was “rewarded” with a long
period of unemployment. The bureaucrats of the
Transport Workers’ Union made plans to somehow

“gag the mouth” of this inconvenient leader of the
revolutionary opposition by providing him with a soft
job in the union. But they soon learned how hope-
less it was to attempt such things.

Joins Ranks of ‘Revoluﬁonary Opposiﬁon

After the betrayal by social-democracy at the out-
set of the war, Ernst Thaelmann passed into the
ranks of the opposition, which ‘forced the leaders
of Ham-burg social-democracy to bring their treach-
erous policy for discussion at a number of stormy
delegate meetings. Already in 1914 Ernst Thael-
mann was called to -the army. Not a dayof fur-
lough did he get for two and a half years; and the
only interruption was a period of imprisonment fol-
lowing a war tribunal sentence. During this whole
period Ernst Thaelmann maintained his connections
with the revolutionary circles in Hamburg and re-
ceived opposition newspapers and illegal propaganda
material. In 1917, while spending his short fur-
lough in Hamburg, he -became a member of the newly
founded Independent Social-Democratic Party. He
used his furlough to discuss methods of illegal ac-
tivity in the army.

When the November Revolution broke out, a
strong Independent Social-Democratic Party was al-
ready in existence in Hamburg alongside of the old
social~democracy, as well as an illegal, numerically
much weaker, "Left-radical” grouping, which was
exceptionally imbued with syndicalist elements. Any-
body who wanted to join the “Left-radical” “organiza-
tion of unity”, was asked to resign from his -trade
union. Participation in parliamentary elections was
rejected “in principle”; This sectarian line excited
