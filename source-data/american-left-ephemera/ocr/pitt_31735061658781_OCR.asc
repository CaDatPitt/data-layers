in slightly different words by Columbia University administrators,
warns:

“Many college grads this June will ﬁnd good jobs are hard to
get. There is no’ longer a spot waiting for just ANY man with a
sheepskin.” (And if this goes for the elite of Columbia, what
awaits the poor beaver of C.C.N.Y. or the few other so-called poor-
men’s colleges?)

The system that gives rise to the danger of war and that makes
periodic economic crises inevitable, also generates racism and fas-
cism. Imperialism cannot tolerate democracy. Twelve men are
on trial today in Foley Square because, with Marxist foresight,

they warned the American people back in 1945 of the post-war
course of U.S. imperialism. ‘

The Communists are on trial today because they are the leading

,.,defenders of the interests of .the American people against Wall
Street.

As in Germany, the attack on the Communists is the hub on
the wheel of the growing fascist-- danger—a wheel whose spokes
represent assaults on the rights of every section of the common
people. ~

Since Wall Street indicted the 12, there has been less and less
democracy for the youth and students of our country. ]immy
Zarichny has been expelled from Michigan State College for listen-

I ing to a speech by Carl Winter. Phil Bock, Communist youth

leader, has twice been put j behind bars along with others of
the “Los Angeles 20” for refusing to be a stoolpigeon for witch-
hunters. A progressive student in Dartmouth has been murdered.
Hooliganism was used to deprive two veterans of the right to speak
on a New Haven, Conn., street corner. Seven Baltimore members

- _ of the Young Progressives of America face jail because of their ac-
tivity against jim Crow. Hans Freistadt is now being robbed of .

his right to teach and to continue his education because of his
political beliefs—and there are probably few campuses in the
country where an academic freedom issue has not sharply emerged.

Along with anti-Communism, anti-Negro violence and perse-
cution is a major hallmark of rising fascism. The Trenton “6,” the
Ingram Case, the Virginia “7”—-these are increasingly signs of the
times. ‘Police brutality, shootings, and legal lynchings are daily
“answers” to the growing problems and militancy of Negro youth
and veterans. In one place, Negro -young workers are systematically
stopped and searched on the way to work and then layed off on
grounds of “tardiness.” In another, a brick-toting professor in-
cites a mob of students to drive a young Negro off a college cam-

 10

  

    

pus. In dozens of Negro neighborhoods—as well as in Mexican-
American and Puerto Rican communities-curfews are imposed on

‘ the young people, either oﬂicially, or through police threats, har-

rassment, and beatings.

Recounting the deep-seated needs and problems of the youth,
the dangers they face at the hands of a bankrupt system, is surely
testimony enough to the importance of the new organization we
propose to build. The whole spirit of our organization will be one
of fundamental challenge to the shameful state of affairs that would
bring our country and its youth to ruin.

III.

COUNTERING WALL STREET’S IDEOLOGICAL POISON
WITH EDUCATION F OR PEACE, DEMOCRACY,
AND SOCIALISM

Not only can we speak of our projected organization as impor-
tant and necessary—we can properly say that at this precise and criti-
cal moment it must be built.

Why is this so vital now? First of all, because at this crucial
juncture of world history the principles of Scientiﬁc Socialism (in
which our organization will educate young people) are the most

V potent inspiration and guiding force in the whole struggle for peace

  

and progress and against a third world war. We_will deal further,
in this report with how these principles contribute to and are re-
flected in the building of unity and the struggles of the people
everywhere-—and how they are indispensable to the development
of anti—fascist unity and struggle on the part of the youth of our
country. ‘

But, within this framework, there is a more speciﬁc answer to

the question of why an organization which educates youth in the »

spirit of Socialism is a must for our country right now. Namely,
that the question of which way American youth will move, what role
they will play, is now rapidly being brought to a head. This ques-
tion (bigger by far than the proverbial $64 question) is coming» to
a head because of the sharpening war danger and the beginning
of the economic crisis, both of which have a special effect on the
youth and both of which threaten the youth with devastating con-
sequences. Will youth move as a force for peace under the leader-
ship of the working class? Or will the imperialists succeed in mis-

. "But the big decision on which way the youth will move today
‘being arrived at in an atmosphere which is poisoned by a Wall‘. 
treet _ ideological and propaganda offensive against the youth-
 offensive that dwarfs the past efforts of Goebbels in Germany.‘
This we cannot afford to ignore for a moment—for we must recog- ‘ « .

inizej that youth’s inexperience can, in the absence of working i
class leadership, put its boundless energies in the hands of dema-
gogues and enemies of mankind. (To make this point crystal-clear,

is only necessaryvto contrast the path chosen in the 1930’s by

V pmerican youth, who went with the labor-progressive coalition,

if that of the German youth whose minds were poisoned by .
Let? us look at some of the manifold efforts that the capitalist
Ideologists are di’recting at the youth. In examining the forms and

.-content of their offensive, we can learn much. Such an examina-

V "on reveals no’? only their desperate and dangerous activity among G V
the youth?“ but also exposes the basic attitudes of the ruling class
toward the youth: its fundamental distrust and fear, its revolting 4” 

ondescension, its thinly veiled brass-knuckle methods for crush-
lg every independent thought and expression. It reveals the im-. v
 -portant lesson that the capitalist class with all its resources is al-
says forced to operate against the stream of youth’s interests and;
1ncl_inations—and that the working class, —its Marxist leadership; l
hasﬁthe inevitable advantage of representing the real interests of the
youth, of representing life and the future. Learning this will es.-
ti blish the fullest conviction in the necessity of and vast possibili-‘ j . e
y «for the work and development of our new organization. G if
let us‘ take, as a first example, the ‘elaborate 4th Annual Forum _ V 
. gh. Schools, sponsored‘ by the Herald ‘Tribune this March a

 

 

 

 

With the aid of three airlines, countless government agencies here.

and abroad, numerous radio and television stations and lots more,
the Tribune paraded 34 young people from 17 Marshall Plan coun-
tries before the natio_n’s high school students, and the general pub-
lic. The theme was: “Working together for the world we want.”
Here, then, was a gala spectacle of “free discussion,” “honoring”
the opinions of young people. That is, within certain limits. The
first requirement in selecting delegates was that they speak the
English language. The next was that they be screened and ap-
proved by Marshall Plan governments. “Freedom of discussion”
began only after and on the basis of acceptance of anti-Communism,
the cold war and the schemes of Anglo—Saxon world rule.
Keynoter Paul Hoffman of the E.C.A. told’ the youth what work-
ing together means: “Together,” he said, “we can win any war,
either cold or otherwise.” Is it any wonder that the conference’s
“World We Want” appeared to be U.S. Imperialist patented? That
discussions on economic systems were reduced, in the words of As-
sistant Secretary of State Allen, to the concept _that the world will

beat a path to the door of whoever makes a better mouse trap? it

That the science discussion centered on the role of the food pill
in relation to the reactionary Malthusian theories of overpopulation?
That culture centered only on jazz vs. bebop? That the philosophy
expert of the conference was Father Cannon, who declares that
the trouble with American education is that it is “watered” down
by its “mass set-up?” ,_

But one thing about youth——they have questions, they want to
know, despite even Marshall Plan hand-picking. Imagine the cha-
grin of the Norwegian Ambassador when on the very day he was

_ negotiating with Acheson on the North Atlantic Pact, his son,

Christian Lange, a Forum delegate, asked a speaker, Sir Oliver
Franks—~“Sir Oliver, don’t you think that a North Atlantic Pact
is a defensive pact, an alliance in case of future war, and that, rather
than preventing the third world war will promote it, because it
recognizes the war as a fact and settles sides in the ﬁght?” (Of
course, we might suggest that Christian Lange probe still further
and ask himself if a pact which “will promote” war should not be
termed a war pact instead of a “defensive pact”)  '
There were other ﬁssures. When an Austrian delegate asked a

question which was a sharp, incisive indictment of the ]im Crow 5 _

system, Secretary Allen could only. parry the question with patroniz-
ing ﬂattery about how the questioner must be the brightest girl
in all Austria. And the tipoff came when an Italian youth, sick of

jingoistic prattle about U.S. “moral leadership,” said: “I get afraid

13

 

 

 

i when I hear you talking about a world leader. Hitler already tried

that. I want to say this: the role of world leader must not be played

’ by anybody; otherwise there will be a war again.”

One of the important features of the “Marshall Plan forum”
is that the New York Board of Education joined officially in spon-
soring and administering it. While on Foley Square, judge Medina
makes little pretense of impartial justice, the education system is
abandoning its traditional claims of “objectivity.” The school chil-

' dren of American workers are forced to bathe in the ofﬁcial mud

of the warmongering, treacherously mis-named “zeal for democracy”

' program, from kindergarten up. In colleges, “objectivity” takes such

startling forms as one university professor’s ﬁnal exams, in which
his students are directed to “refute the following 9 Marxist the-
ories.” Everyone makes speeches about the need in these times
for “education with a mission,” and one honored professor of Edu-
cation urges that “administrators of liberal arts colleges go to the

Army for lessons to make their education programs ‘functional’ and

‘meaningful.’ ” And through all this “ideological” ﬂim-ﬂam the
wolves’ teeth glisten in the form of the assaults on student and fac-
ulty expression: It reaches a point where even Professor Laski is
banned from U.C.L.A., and one is thereby reminded of the “Daily
Worker” cartoon—~wherein the man being clubbed by the cops pro-
tests: “But, I’m an anti-Communist” and the cop, continuing, replies:
“I don’t care what kind of a Communist you are.”

But what do the capitalist ideologists tell the young workers,
the Negro youth? How do they explain their sharpening problems?
Simply by repeating over and over again that whatever our “weak-
nesses” we’ve got the best. The Catholic hierarchy’s publications
moralize against the young workers who are ashamed of their work-
ing conditions, falsely identifying the concept of pride in labor
with the acceptance of capitalist exploitation. Secretary of Com-
merce Sawyer organizes a special Washington Conference of Negro

9 youth to berate them for being slow to explore business opportu-

nities “begging for persons with daring and initiative.” With con-
descension worthy of a “good” Southern bourbon, he has the un-
mitigated gall to spout nonsense like the following: ". . . assuming
that only the Negro market would be available to Negro business
men—-which is certainly not the case (sic)—the best statistics we
have indicate that approximately 15,000,000 non-white consumers
in the country have a purchasing power of $15,000,000,000 annu-
ally.” And the latest masterpiece, which papers particularly recom-
mend for reading by young Americans is the booklet, “The Gift
of Freedom,” which means big business when it says “freedom.”
14

 

 

 

 

 
   

This pamphlet lists tables on all the sugar, radios, cars, etc., an
American worker earns in a half-hour or so. One is compelled
to wonder: will not some youth, reading of these miracles per-
formed with Wall Street on the throne, stop short and declare:
“But look! The king_ is naked! His ﬁne clothes do not conceal the
facts of growing joblessness among young people, of anti—Negro
violence and oppression!” p

For its part, The World Telegram admits that young people

are facing joblessness or deadend jobs only to try to sell young peo- ‘

ple the line that it’s the fault of the unions, the closed shop and
the lack of adequate incentive pay, speed-up plans. ,
It is important to note additional aspects of the ideological

‘ offensive as they appear in some of the big-business controlled mass

organizations of youth. It is very signiﬁcant that in the Y.W.C.A. all
kinds of pseudo-liberal programs are developed, that are reﬂections
of the strong democratic sentiments of the young women and espe-
cially of the industrial girls as proven in the recent convention.
The healthy desire for unity between Negro and white girls has
been met by a very extensive program of brotherhood and “toler-
ance” with a strong social-work ﬂavor. But the Board of Directors
frowns on anything resembling common action for Negro rights
and, at the Convention, resolutions on the Ingram Case and other
such issues were arbitrarily pigeon—holed. -
Similarly, the Y’s stand -on foreign policy puts all its emphasis
on humanitarianism, supporting the Marshall Plan and avoiding
mention of more obvious war planks. The peace sentiments of the
girls are attested to by the fact that the directors thought it best
demagogically to conceal their purposes in lining up with the
splitting imperialist-inspired World Assembly ofYouth, the splinter-
opposition to the great World Federation of Democratic Youth.
Only technical “a-political” reasons were given and there was no
public baiting of the W.F.D.Y.. What is more important, despite
the concealment, there was considerable rank and ﬁle expression
in the industrial panel against the measure to divide the youth of

‘the world along Marshall Plan lines.

 

 

It should be mentioned that a more conscious ﬁght by delegates
of the Jewish Young Fraternalists against such a measure in the
National Conference of Jewish Youth succeeded in exposing and
checking the line of the apologists for imperialism. ,

This partial examination of the ruling class’ varied ideological
offensive against the youth leaves unmentioned the tremendous
outpourings of a more vulgar, openly fascist type: the pulp maga-
zines, comic books’ and movies—stuff like True Confessions’

15

 

 

  

“Trapped by Sex, Confessions of a Communist,” which is a measure
of capitalist morality. . 0

As with almost everything else, Wall Street even has unlimited
supplies of its ideological poison to export to other parts of the
world. Recently a Polish UN delegate urged U.S. imperialism to
stop talking about exporting “democracy,” because it doesn’t have
enough for home consumption. But this didn’t deter Wall Street

    

backers from lavishly ﬁnancing a group of missionaries of,‘ the’

psuedo-fascist outﬁt, Youth for Christ, who went to Cuba to preach

the wonders of Yankee Imperialism to the Cuban young people._

They boastfully and appropriately described their exploits in the
Youth for Christ magazine under the heading “Cuba Invaded,” fea-
tured by a picture of bombs dropping from an airplane. They ex-
pressed their thanks for Wall Street’s generosity in vivid, if unor-
thodox, terms: “As for transportation, God provided the best-a
1948 Cadillac limousine, custom built to carry eleven passengers and
their necessary luggage.”

Another example of this kind of “export” is reported by the Free
Austrian Youth. This export item is carried on the person of soldiers
of the Anglo-Saxon Armies of occupation in Germany. These soldiers
make use of a 16—page dictionary of “standard” phrases in German
and English, which the Austrians refer to as the Dictionary of Love,
and which we may refer to as the Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon white
supremacy. The dictionary starts off with “I love you” followed up
by “show me your papers.” It is replete with phrases such as “will
you come with me,” “it is not far from here,” “how much will it cost,”
etc. There are absolutely no hints on how to carry on conversation
about literature, plays, music, politics, work or any other such sub-
ject. The Austrian youth accompany their description of the diction-
ary with a few facts and ﬁgures:

“In the American zoneof Germany 152,000 cases of V.D. were
counted in 1946. During the ﬁrst six months of 1947, V.D. in Bremen
increased by 6,446 new cases and during August 1947, for every
1,000 persons in Bremen area there were 249 cases of Syphilis or
Gonorrhea.” What a shameful travesty Wall Street’s culture (and
the policies this “culture” decorates) make of the reputation that
American G.I.’s bravely earned but a short time ago as ﬁghters for
freedom, enemies’ of fascist depravity!

From the glimpse we have taken into Wall Street’s ideological
offensive against the youth, the dangers to American youth are clear.
Wall Street is teaching chauvinism, white supremacy, the inevita-

 

bility of war, inhumantiy, violence. It’s aim is to corrupt a whole _

generation as Hitler did. It’s results are seen in vigilante hooliganism
16

  

baitiig  tha havegtbeentmadegin the minds of’manyyb[ungllAmelf 
  we have also seen that Wall Street’s  work ‘goes 
he traditions, democratic instincts and character of our country" i A
V outh—-that, therefore, its job, of corruption is far froma complet .
" success; and thatlgreat opportunities exist for piercing llmperialis

all of mud and reaching young people with truth. _g A « or
f In this context, it is hard to overestimate the importance of 
launching of a youth organization which bases itself on educatio
 the spirit of Scientiﬁc Socialist principles, mankind’s‘ highest
, standards of morality and life. American youth will be won for de-.

‘ tense of democracy and peace more effectively if there is a force’ .
ywithin the youth movement that fundamentally counters and ex-A 
poses on a day to day basis Wall Street’s evil attentions to the youth; he he
:We say that those young workers and other young peoplewho con-[S

sciously strive to learn about our society, to represent the best -
‘ interests of the working class, to develop Socialist idealism, are the A “
indispensable hope and heart of the democratic education and I 
“struggles of American youth. g 4 
i What do we mean when we say that our projected new organiza-p 
tion will educate youth in the spirit of Socialism? How does the 
teaching of the principles of Scientiﬁc Socialism contrast‘ with what 
is taught by the imperialists? “ ‘ L We
. First of all, through the study of Marxism, young people will?
be able to learn in our organization an understanding of the class] 1
nature of our society and why. the working class is “the source of 1
progress in the modern world.” Young people will learn that what 7
goes on in the world-—and‘all events surrounding and inﬂuencing:
their daily lives—can be understood in terms of the struggle between, ‘
the two great contending classes: the capitalists, who own the mills L
and the factories, and the workers who must work forthe capital-, ’ r .
ists in order to live. As we have seen, in this imperialist stage of 3 ’
capitalism, every corrupt, reactionary, and fascist element in society * A »
clings for survival to the big capitalist who proﬁts by war and lives 7 L,
by exploitation ‘at home and abroad. On the other hand, every," ‘
decent, progressive, forward-looking element must necessarily hitch  A
' s kite to the working class-—in ﬁrm al1iance—since this class not»,
only is the largest and strongest, but, by its very position in society, 
‘can only advance its interests in struggle against War and all forms
to Exploitation. . ” i =4 r is A

 

    

Second, in our organization young people will be able to learn
about working-class internationalism and how it is indicisible from
love of country. The imperialists try to equate patriotism to chau-
vinism and racist concepts of Anglo-Saxon white supremacy. In
effect, their degrading deﬁnition of patriotism offers as an example
those Germans who unquestioningly followed der Fuhrer to war,
crime, and destruction. In our organization young people will learn
that the workers of each country are the real patriots, because the
workers of every country share in common the deep desire for
peace and for the independence of nations—the ordinary people of
the world have no interest in ﬁghting each other or oppressing
each other. This is the fundamental patriotic content of the recent
inspiring statements for peace and international solidarity by Paul
Robeson and by Foster and Dennis in our country, and by Commu-
nists and outstanding progressives of almost every other country in
the world. _

Our projected organization will teach youth to ﬁght, as they
would a plague, chauvinism and the white supremacist ideas that
surround the national oppression of the Negro people within the
United States. Young people will be able to absorb in the fullest
sense the fundamental tenet taught by Karl Marx, and often ex-
pressed in the writings of Abraham Lincoln and other great Ameri-
cans: namely that there can be no freedom for the workers of one
nation who aid in the enslavement of other nations and peoples. In
short, it can be said that young people will learn in our organiza-
tionthe truth that ]ohn Adams stated over 150 years ago, that there
is no patriotism which is incompatible with justice.

Third, based on the foundations already indicated, young peo-
ple will be able to develop in our organization concepts of working-
class morality, as opposed to capitalist morality. Lenin, one of the
truly great Marxist scientists and leaders of mankind, paraphrased
the mottos of capitalist morality variously as follows: “I seek my
own proﬁt and I don’t care a hang for anything else;” or “Rob or be
robbed”; or “Be a slave owner or a slave.” As opposed to this, Marx-
ism projects the concept (again in the words of Lenin): “Morality
serves to help human society rise to a higher level and get rid of the
exploitation of labor.” The capitalists claim that their dog-eat-dog
morality cannot be changed, that “human nature” is something ﬁxed
for all time. Marxists know and teach the science of dialectical and
historical materialism; they know that every revolutionary change
in society (those that have occurred in the past and the great
change through which the world is now passing), gives rise to new
standards of morality, to new values, to further changes in “human

18

 

\ nature.” The morality developedlthrough the struggles of the work-

 

 
   

ing-class——that class which has as its mission the complete abolition
of oppression and of exploitation of man by man—is the morality of
unselﬁshness, of brotherhood, of wholehearted ‘dedication to the
cause of freedom, of tireless devotion to the advancement of man-
kind’s horizons in culture, in science, in the arts. That is why work-
ing class morality is, in the last analysis, the only morality fully

compatible with and capable of giving realization to the aspirations A

and ideals of the young generation.

Fourth, in our projected organization youth will be able to learn
what Socialism is, as contrasted with capitalism. Youth will be able
to learn the new vs. the old, emancipation vs. enslavement. Social-
ism is the system built by the workers, who then own the mills, the
factories, and all the other means of production on behalf of society.
Production no longer is for proﬁts for the few: no man can get rich
on the labor of another. Whereas, capitalism is forced to stand
against the oceans of progress, to resist the very productive forces
it has unleashed—Socialism opens the gates toward unlimited prog-

ress, toward mastery over nature, toward meeting the economic,

social, and cultural needs of the people. Socialism provides lasting
peace and freedom, because it is a classless society and does not
contain within itself forces that beneﬁt from, need or can bring
about war and oppression. Because the young people who will join
and build our projected organization love our country, they will
learn to look toward a socialist future for America—-a future in which
the tremendously rich potentialities of our country and its youth can
ﬁnd full fruition. Young people will learn to look about in the world
of today, to see that Socialism is no longer a dream, that it has
already been achieved in the USSR and is being built in the new
democracies of Eastern Europe. Every slander and calumny di-
rected against the USSR by the Hitlers, Churchills, and Wall Street

ppropagandists is explained precisely by the fact that the Soviet

Union is a socialist country, and as such, inevitably desires and works
for peace and the constant .raising of the living standards of its
people. In fact, in the midst of all the war talk, the wretchedness
and hatred spewed by the imperialists, the USSR is advancing be-
yond socialism toward communism: that higher stage in which the
productive forces are great enough to provide fully for all the needs
of the people; that stage in which a new kind of men and women

:have come of age, men and women who were able to grow up with

 

minds and characters free of the corrupting vestiges of the old
“make a buck, climb over your neighbor” psychology. Young people
of all lands will surely take inspiration and gain conﬁdence in a

 Broadway —- Room 314 -— New York City 3, \1\\Iew Ydrk

One of the ﬁrst steps in the building of our projected new Aorglane-r-A
Ization should be to assure that the educational program is made]
part and‘ parcel of the organizing drive for a Labor Youth League. A
 particular the Initiating Committee proposes that the educational 
program popularize and use the important Foster document in de-
offense of the indicted Communist leaders. This is a profound scientiﬁc _ A
 answerwto the liars who try to distort Marxism. It is perhaps the most '  A a
"striking refutation by any working-class leader in our country’s his— V
ltory of the vicious slanders directed ‘by the capitalists against the A 
'  ideas of Socialism. It is the sharpest rebuttal to the imperialists who
 falsely shout accusations of force and violence only to conceal their
* j,~ destructive crimes from the people. This document, which is a full ‘
, ' exposition of Marxist thinking about the problems before our coun- ,
 try, is from beginning to end a bulwark of peace and progress and a ‘ '
, weapon against force and violence. It is particularly important to p
 L young people because in it Foster has succinctly presented the rich
A fruits of many years of experience as the outstanding leader of the
.__ American laborjand Communist movement. We may also expect that
C  5 Foster’s new bhok, “The Twilight of Capitalism,” will represent for
 thousands of young people the introduction to socialist thinking and
‘ the threshold to a bright future. C A
t The Foster document not only lends itself to study withinthe
._ clubs we propose to build, but is capable of reaching out in the
"ﬁymost understandable terms to broad masses of American young
 T workers and students. It represents, therefore, what should be one
sf of the key features of educational work in the new organization,
namely, that our training of new working class leaders must take
ed A place within the setting of the boldest ideological campaign among
' ‘ all sections of the young people. Therefore, a plan should be devel-
L hoped to bring the Foster document and the issues that it raises in
U V forums, debates, discussion groups to many thousands of youth. ‘

‘BUILDING YOUTH UNITY AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM,

tion has no meaning divorced from participation in the life, experi-
ences and battles of the workers and the youth-especially when the
struggles for peace, democracy, progress and Socialism are raging
all about us and the future of mankind is being determined. There-
fore, we declare that the Labor Youth League will dedicate itself
to participation in every struggle of the workers and common people
and to the building of ﬁghting unity arﬁong the youth.

While listing a number of tasks in this respect, which will be
elaborated in our discussion of a program of action later today, I
want to dwell seriously on only one: the central question of peace.

The world-wide peace movement which is ﬁnding growing ex-
pression amongsections of the American people can succeed only
if it recognizes that Wall Street will not give an inch voluntarily,
that it does not want agreement, that it is afraid of peace. Any lin-

_ gering doubts about this should be dispelled by events surrounding

the current foreign ministers’ conference in Paris and the German
situation. After suppressing news of the latest Soviet peace bid for a
couple of months, the State Department ﬁnally found it impossible
to double-talk its way around the very simple and direct Soviet pro-
posal for the lifting of mutual trade and travel restrictions in Berlin

and the convening of the Ministers’ meeting in Germany. The whole A
world stirs with hope for agreement——as it has previous to every

Truman rebuff to a new Soviet peace bid. But Acheson, Johnson,
Connally and Vandenberg are hastening to reassure Wall Street that
their war policies will go on unabated and that every attempt will

” be made to wreck the Ministers’ Conference—-if possible! They con-

tinue to push at full speed for the North Atlantic Pact, the global
armaments program, and the West German military state. Lest the
idea of agreement spread too far, they promptly turned thumbs
down on a further Soviet proposal for Greek peace. They are flirting
with Franco Spain more ﬂagrantly than ever—the hypocrisy of their

’ T abstension in the recent UN voting on Spain is shown in their lavish
1 entertainment of Brazil’s dictator, Dutra, who sponsored the pro-

Franco resolution. (Only last week, Truman appropriately sat down
next to white supremacist Senator McKellar of Tennessee at a recep-
tion to hear fascist Dutra hail U.S. law and order and the U.S. press
as outstanding instruments of “peace” and “democracy..”) The tip-off
on State Dept. intentions at the Foreign Ministers’ Conference came
in Acheson’s statement before departing for Paris. Two columns of
expert smooth talk were boiled down to one brutally frank head-
line by the “New York Sun,” which blared forth: “Acheson Flying
to Paris Talks with ‘No Compromise’ as Policy.”  which point,
plenty of dead American Soldiers, F.D.R., and the buried principle

, of ‘Big Three Unity of World War II-'—all must have turned over

   

in their graves in one motion!)

And now, true to form, with the ministers’ conference hardly
begun, a monstrous provocation is taking place in Berlin. Anti-
Communist, pro-Nazi elements are being organized in West Berlin
to disrupt railroad communications and compel reprisals around
the self—same currency double-dealing with which the Western zone
powers lit the fuse on the original incitement in Berlin.

It is abundantly clear from this that only a powerful movement
of the people, demanding peace, will produce positive results out of
the very important foreign ministers’ talks. In fact it is this spirit
of demand, of insistence on peace that is today being grasped by
millions of ordinary people everywhere—and S that is the factor
capable of smashing and thwarting the imperialist’s effort to unleash
war. We say ﬁrmly that war is not inevitable, because we know that

S the forces of the people who want peace—-if united, active, and un-

 
 

wavering-are superior to those of the blood-money tycoons who
want war. This spirit of militancy, of conﬁdence in the strength of
the people and in the cause of peace, is symbolized in the opening
statement of ]oliot Curie to the Paris Peace Conference: “VVe are
not here to ask for, but to impose peace upon those who favor war.”

The peace conferences in Paris and New York brought together
representatives of millions of people, of all countries, with varying
political beliefs, with different philosophies. The very hysteria with
which the war-makers greeted these conferences was testimony to
their strength and effectiveness. The imperialists fear the commit-
tees of resistance to war, through which the peace movement is be-
ginning to be built in many countries-—among workers, farmers,
students, scientists. /

. Giving emphasis to these new and enormously signiﬁcant devel-
opments in the peace camp, the major deterrent to the plans of the
war-makers remains the vast and growing strength for peace of the
USSR. The Gabriel Heatters may whistle-in-the-dark, looking for
signs of weakness in the Soviet Union’s consistent pressing for peace
talks and agreement on Germany. But Heatter’s big business supe-
riors are undoubtedly whistling a much more genuine kind of
whistle—one of dismay and astonishment as they read that the sec-
ond year of the 5 year plan is 23 per cent overfulﬁlled, in industry,
in agriculture, in food, clothing and housing for the people.

One must also, of course, point to events in China. What could
be more inspiring than the fact that, at the very height of the impe-

rialist drive for warbases all over the globe, the Chinese people are ‘~

taking Nanking, Shanghai—their entire vast nation—out of the hands
. 22

  

 
   

of the puppets of war and corruption? The wiseacres ask: “How, if

you are for peace, can you cheer on the Chinese Liberation Armies?”

  

The New York Times, one of the wiseacres, exposes its own
hypocrisy when it approvingly writes that Chiang Kai—shek’s
strategy is to retreat and hold out in hope of World War III!

On a world scale, it can be said that young people are very much I

in the forefront of this decisive ﬁght for peace. The World Federa-
tion of Democratic Youth brings together in action 52,000,000 young
people from 63 nations around the main slogan “YOUTH UNITE!”
“FORWARD FOR LASTING PEACE,’ DEMOCRACY, INDE-
PENDENCE, AND A BETTER LIFE!” It has organized powerful
support from all parts of the world for the anti-fascist youth of
Greece and Spain and the ﬁghting youth of the colonies. It has
aroused the moral indignation of young people everywhere against
Wall Street’s anti-Negro violence and political persecution of youth
and students; It is now preparing for this summer’s 2nd World Youth
Congress and 2nd World Youth Festival, which together will form

the greatest demonstration‘of international youth solidarity in world ‘

history.

It certainly is no accident that youth stands out in the world 0

peace front—war is the ﬁrst enemy of youth and historically the
modern socialist and later the anti-fascist youth movement gained
their spurs in the ﬁght against the forces of militarism and impe-
rialist war. ‘

Is there, then, a basis for advancing toward an organized peace
movement among the youth of our country? Unquestionably yes, if:

A 1) Greater boldness is shown in pushing the peace question in
its concrete aspects to the fore; 2) a broader approach is developed
to unity around speciﬁc issues; 3) there is a consistent effort to
establish the central connection between every ﬁght for economic
needs, the rights of Negro youth, academic freedom, etc. with
youth’s desire for peace; and 4) there is no shrinking from the wid-
est engagement in ideological combat based on a conﬁdence in
youth’s ability to learn and thus to ﬁght for its real interests.

Each of these vital elements has been sorely wanting. That is
why, although there is considerable stirring and militancy among
the youth on a host of issues, U.S. youth lags behind on the peace
front.

We believe that our projected new organization, equipped with
enthusiasm and a fundamental outlook, will be able to contribute
vitally toward overcoming these weaknesses. ‘ v

The organizing drive itself must be planned to contribute to the
kind of mass activity and unity that will bring before every section

  

 

 this’ connection, we greet the recent statement of youth leader

pposing the North Atlantic warcpact. It was signed by outstand
_ gs national ileaders,‘_as individuals, of the National Conference 
Methodist Youth, the National Council of ]ewish Youth, the Young
Progressives of America, the National Student Council of the A
Y.M.C.A. and a number of key trade union and Negro youth leaders >

_ This is of great signiﬁcance because it is the broadest youth expres-it V

sion of its kind in many years and demonstratively shows the new
 opportunities appearing for youth action forpeace. A

V eWe greet also and will support the increasingly effective work to if

9 win the young workers to action for peace and for their economic ,
needswby the Young Progressives of America. Y.P.A. represents .

if among’ the youth the growing anti-fascist and actively pro-demo- L

 cratic forces that are the spearhead for the development of abroad

peace ﬁght in our country. Y.P.A.’s young workers’ conferences, in_- Y A

A‘ itiated in a number of key industrial localities, have won real sup-T

port from employed and unemployed youth, Negro and white-

eiachieving signiﬁcant representation from numerous trade union 10.4
A cals. The first of these conferences unfortunately kept the peace

0 _'_ question in the background, but the ﬁght on the North Atlantic Pact l

is emerging as a strong factor in preparation for Y.P.A.’s national . 0

economic conference and lobby on ]une 4 and 5. Y.P.A. has held

 successful peace rallies in over 20 cities in April around the Salute

it to_ F .D.R. theme. The New York rally packed Manhattan Center .

3,000 strong to hear Wallace and Marcantonio in as enthusiastic

and youthful a rally as we have seen in many a moon. These, too,
are’ signs of the growing possibilities for action.
A While the colleges are at the end of a school year, it is neverther

llless necessary to look "ahead to a much more aggressive carrying

of the struggle for peace to the campus. The possibilities are»un-

 deniable, but no one is showing real initiative. Where will one
as ﬁnd a more inspiring example of militancy than in the C.C.N.Y.

strike against anti-Negro, anti-Semitic professors? The witch-

A hunter§'are attacking, intimidating and ﬁring progressives and Corn-A
Z rnunists on every campus when;-lo and behold! in the middle of
everything, C.C'.N.Y.’s student body stands up and says: “Get rid? V
of the fascists! Clean out the white chauvinistsl” But even here 5

e. campus is almost devoid of concrete action for peace—and the

  

 

failure to make this link permitted certain phoney “liberal” student
leaders to practically cut the strike off from outside support on the
utterly idiotic grounds that the strike was an internal campus issue.

_ What is necessary on the campus is greater boldness on the peace

question, recognizing "the real signiﬁcance of the many united
committees and mass demonstrations on academic freedom and
discrimination that mushroom up everywhere.’ What are these but
a reaction, to some extent conscious, of the students against the
vicious effects of the cold war on the campus? ‘ '

For youth and students, alike, a major project this summer
is activity around and participation in the World Youth Congress
and Festival of the W.F.D.Y. Already the proposed attendance: of
popular young workers’ delegates from a number of key shops and
areas is receiving increasingsupport. This should be stepped up,
and accompanied by demonstrative local activities that give large
numbers of young Americans a strong sense of solidarity with the
youth and students of all nations who will be represented at these
history-making events. ‘

In general, it would be premature to specify the forms that will
give the necessary cohesion to the peace front among the youth.
But we, as a leading element in the youth movement, must help
rapidly to evolve perspectives in this direction on the basis of maxi-
mum, varied, local initiative. Quick reaction to issues as they arise

A is decisive in this respect: e.g., responding with mass support to

the various peace bids and new opportunities and not giving Pro-
fessor Acheson limitless opportunity for dousing peace hopes with
the wet blanket of falsehood and confusion. On the basis of such
day to day action. andbroadening support, every possibility must
be sought out for united peace gatherings and conferences, ﬁnd-
ing the forms, however, ﬂexible (through councils, committees,

» etc.) for developing continuity and extending the ﬁght.

While, as I have mentioned, this report will not elaborate a full
program of action on many of the vital issues before the youth,

‘ I want now simply to indicate a number of phases of activity which,
-together with the question of peace, should be fully discussed and

mapped out under that point in the conference agenda headed
“Program of Action.” The major single campaign that we wish to
propose during the organizing drive is the winning of young peo-
ple for a concerted ﬁght against the Reichstag frame-up of the
Communist leaders on Foley Square. This campaign must bring
us face-to-face with young people in all of their organizations and
wherever else they may be gathered. We see this campaign as a
vital part——in'fact, as perhaps our most important immediate con-

 

 

 

tr"i,bution—to the ﬁght for peace. It is not only a campaign in which
our ideas will be fully presented, but it will be connected with ‘con-3 ’
crete struggle around every important issue-particularly’ around . -
the rights of Negro youth, for the freedom of the Trenton Six, and
against a multitude of local examples of police brutality. '
As we develop our activities, our organization will take the
most active interest in the economic needs of the young workers in
shops and in industries, and of other sections of the. youth popula-
tion as well. In this respect, we should discuss immediate support
for the important movement that is developing for the extension
of 52-20 and the renewal of eligibility for those vets who have
already used up their unemployment beneﬁts. This is an opening
gun in the ﬁght to expose the scandal of rising unemployment among
the youth and of government irresponsibility in this respect. In
. particular, as part of the ﬁght for jobs for all youth, we propose to
work in every way for unity around the question of jobs for Negro
youth, supporting such actions as the demonstration on this issue
of Michigan youth in their state capital, and developing concrete
job struggles that unite Negro and white youth in every major
‘city. »
In developing our program of action, it will be part of the
. fundamental outlook of our organization to rally young people in
support of the strike struggles and other actions, of the workers.
In these struggles, we will encourage the labor movement to pro-
mote demands which combat every kind of special discrimination-
against youth on the job in terms of wages, speed-up, problems
of young women, training and advancement, health, etc. Our soli-
darity with the workers is clearly evident at this Very gathering,
where we have present with us young Ford strikers, Singer strikers,
furniture,_ strikers from the Deep South, and young workers from
dozens of major industries. The Initiating Committee of this Con-
ference is conﬁdent that their presence will be reflected in getting
our organizing ‘drive off to an outstanding start, on a solid founda-
tion and with a fighting program of action.

V.

A YOUTH oECAN1zAT1oN OF A SPECIAL KIND '. . . WITH
I CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE

Now in this concluding section‘ of the report, I would like to
' deal with a number of particular questions about the new or-
» I 26

Tganization andfhow we propose to  lit.  answering ‘t;hes”ef

questions we can makemore deﬁnitive a number of ideas in ‘regard

— to the character of the organization, the basis for which we believe

has been presented in the report as a whole.

1. Who can belong?

We propose in the draft by-laws that membership in our
new organization be ‘open to‘ any young person who accepts
any of its aims and principles and who works for the general
welfare of the organization. We are not building a political party
of youth, but an organization for young people who want to learn,
whose ideas may still be uncrystallized but who want to work to-
gether to advance the well-being and the interests of youth and of
the working people. We want in this organization young people
who are Workers, farmers, students, veterans, young people from

i "every walk of life, but especially we want to build our organization
; among young workers and among the Negro youth. Some may say

that only those who consider themselves Communists will enter
our organization. But our experiences in preparing this conference
and our conﬁdence in broad sections of American young people
convince us that this is only wishful thinking on the part of the
witch-hunters, those who want to control the thoughts of young
people. Because the need for this organization, as we have pointed
out, arises out of the deepest needs and desires of the young people,

"growing numbers of youth-—beset by problems and looking for

answers—will very naturally help to build this organization in the
period ahead. Nor will these youth be intimidated. For the
building of this organization will actually be part of the ﬁght for
the right of young people to think, ‘their right to learn about social-
ism, for their right to take sides in struggle with the working class.

:

2. Why will it center attention on
young workers and Negro youth? A

4

The answer to this question is inherent inpthe very purposes
which we are setting for our new organization. We will build espe-

A cially among the young workers because they are a part, a vital part,

of the decisive class, the working class. We will build among Negro
youth because they are part and parcel of the decisive national

liberation movement. of the Negro people in our country. We

especially will build among the young workers and the Negro
27 _

 
    
 

 

   
  
 

youth because the alliancebetween the working class and the Negro l l \

péople’s liberation movement is today, as it has been since the
days of the Civil War, the indispensable requirement for any for-
ward motion on the part of the American people as a whole. This,
by the“ way, is why we will especially single out the ﬁght against
white chauvinism among the young people, because there can be no
alliance of Negro and white youth which is not based on the most
stubborn ﬁght on the part of the white youth, ﬁrst of all, against
all racist ideas and forms of oppression. The importance which we
attach to these questions should be the heart of the discussion that
will follow if this report is accepted, in our planning of a charter
membership and‘ building drive. We should talk over and plan
the ways and means of building clubs of the National Organizing
Conference for a Labor Youth League in shops, in industries as
well as among the youth in major industrial communities. We
should similarly guarantee that large and effective clubs of the
new organization are built in the major Negro communities in cities
throughout the country.

Our emphasis on young workers and Negro youth will not in
any way negate or minimize the possibilities for development of
the new organization among students. In fact, provided that spe-
cial steps are also taken to work out an effective program on the
campus, the whole working class content of our organization will
provide meaning and direction to all activities among the students,
helping them to see theanswers to their problems in active alli-
ance with the workers and common people.

3. Will our new organizatioii be

like other youth organizations?

We will have certain essential similarities with other youth or-
ganizations and at the same time certain fundamental distinctions
from them. Our activities will be planned by and for young
people and will take fully into account their desire for, and ability
to develop,. a program of sports, recreation, culture and other youth-
ful activities. Clearly when we speak of the educational role of
our organization, we recognize that all of us learn not only through
study and political struggle, but through every activity in which
we engage. But, of course, a working class spirit will infuse all of
our activities. When we speak of culture, we mean progressive
culture based on the working class, its struggles, its internationalist

  

 
 

   
 

 

   

 

 

principles, its American traditions‘-and not the unhealthy outpour-
ings of the jesters and ideological servants of the ruling class.
Clearly then, while we will have much in common with the young
people in all youth organizations, the fundamental outlook of our
organization will be_ distinguished from that of all other youth or-
ganizations. One big difference between our organization and

_ most other youth organizations is that ours will be independent

and not dominated by adult boards of directors. That is because
our organization will exist in order to give young people the full-
est opportunity to learn and to develop, and not to stifle their ques-
tions or natural militancy, not to try to ﬁt them into a lifeless mold
in an image designed by reactionaries and conservatives. Because
our organization is independent, the young people in it will all the
more readily and fully learn from and develop respect for their
working class elders, whose rich traditions, experiences, and Marxist

science enable them to provide the necessary leadership to the

young generation.

4. What will our new organization

have to do with the Communist Party?

Because of the very natlire of our organization, we will
develop the warmest fraternal relations with the Communist Party
which is the leading party of the American working class. No one
can learn about Marxism, without getting to know how and by
whom Marxist policies are applied from day-to_-day in the interests
of our country and its people. We‘know that our young people
will have much to learn from the Communist Party, from Foster,
from the heroic twelve on trial. Our fraternal relations with the
Communist Party are, of course, not in contradiction to, but a
further expression of the independence of our organization for the
Communists are on principle against control of the youth. Those
whose Marxist outlook makes them the best friends and teachers
of the young people have no reason to fear the independence of
the youth. No doubt, witch-hunters will try to distort this relation-
ship, to distort the character of our organization, to distort the fact
that thousands of non-Communist youth will join in building and
leading our organization. They will make these distortions in order
more easily to attack our organization, using the typical red-baiting
technique of calling every people’s organization Communist or

FRIENDS: C

All of us, I think,‘feel that we are participating in an historic
gathering. We have awaited this Conference eagerly, prepared for
it enthusiastically. Many more than can be with us today--young
Americans and older ones, too—share our conﬁdence that we here
will make wise and constructive decisions. More important, we
anticipate that in time to come many thousands of young people
will look back on this Memorial Week-End Conference as a sig-
niﬁcant milestone in the struggle to improve their daily lives and
advance their hopes for the future.

We who gather here are leading young people, Negro and
white, from every major section of our country. Most of us are
young shop workers and trade unionists. Some are students, lead-
ers of campus Marxist societies, defenders of academic freedom.
Several are from farm areas. Among us are the former leaders
of American Youth for Democracy, Communist youth leaders, lead-
ers of Negro youth and of national group youth clubs and asso-
ciations. Many of us are veterans of the anti-fascist war.

‘We are here to consider steps toward the formation of a new
youth organization. The eight youth leaders who arranged this
conference have embodied a number of recommendations in this
report, which we offer you for discussion and action.

We recommend that this conference launch an organizing drive,
to culminate in a founding convention of a new youth organiza-
tion. I think that we are already all in general agreement as to the
kind of organization we want to build——an organization that will
participate actively in every struggle for the needs of, youth, de-
velop interest in and understanding of Marxism, and educate youth
in a spirit of devotion to the working class and its historic goal of
Socialism. .

On the basis of this common viewpoint, we propose that this
conference agree on a draft statement of principles and draft by-
laws to guide us during the charter club building and membership
drive, and to be submitted later for consideration by the founding
convention.

We do not recommend that we set, at this time, a date for the
founding convention. A maximum period should be allowed for
democratic discussion of all questions, including the name of the
new organization, the ﬁnal editing of the statement of principles,

' 3

,Communis.t-controlled. We, in our new organization, Communists. W
and non-Communists alike, will at all times be proud of our frater-

nal relations with the Communist Party, always strongly combatting ’

any efforts by reactionaries to promote and take advantage of their
distortions. y —

 

5. What will it have to do with

other youth organizations?

Our projected new organization will work for unity amoirg all
youth everywhere. We will take a deep interest in what goes on
among young people wherever they are, in their thoughts, their ex-
periences, their desires. We will try to inﬂuence young people
through free discussion and exchange of ideas, to move in a pro-
gressive direction, to build and support the trade unions, to bring
together their clubs and organizations into united action for peace,
democracy, Negro rights and economic security.

We will cooperate with all progressive forces to build anti-fascist
unity among large sections of the youth. ]ust as the role of
our organization cannot be played by any other youth organization,
so it is also true that we have no aim of replacing or duplicating
other anti-fascist organizations of youth, national group youth
organizations, and organizations of Negro youth. We join with all
progressive forces in supporting the Young Progressives of America
which is representative in the youth ﬁeld of the people’s movement
now developing within and around the important Progressive "Party.
The Y.P.A. has demonstrated that it is an independent organization
which is the most outstanding single expression of the rising
strength of the democratic forces among the youth of our country.
The Y.P.A. is beginning to rally thousands of young people of a
wide variety of opinions and beliefs around an immediate program
of action against the danger of war and fascism and for the eco-
nomic needs of the youth.

Also our new organization will particularly support and coop-
erate with every organized expression of the Negro liberation
-movement among the youth as reflected in the development of the
social and religious clubs of Negro youth and youth councils of
the N.A.A.C.P. We will express this support in joint and united
‘action around pressing issues, particularly the ﬁght for jobs for
Negro youth and the ﬁght against police brutality. r

6. What ,will we do when we leave here?

Our ﬁrst job when we leave this conference, if we agree to launch
the National Organizing Conference for a Labor Youth League, will
be to carry the news everywhere in shops, in communities, on the
campuses. We propose that the period between Decoration Day,
May 80th, and Independence Day, July 4th, be used for this purpose.
Rallies and affairs in large halls, bull sessions and social get-togethers
in homes-in’ every way, in the most popular ways, young people
must get a chance to hear about our proposals, to question them, to
take part in shaping them. Wherever young people gather to hear-
about our conference, they should get a chance not only to exchange
ideas, but to plan in the most concrete way how to bring together
their friends for the building of charter clubs of the National Or-
ganizing Conference for 21 Labor Youth League. The goal that we
project is 100 ﬁrst-charter clubs to be formed the week following
July 4th. The drive to build these 100 ﬁrst—charter clubs must be
combined with mass activity, struggle on issues, debates, forums,
etc., so that our organizing drive from the very outset sounds a
clarion call to young Americans to unite in the ﬁght for peace and

freedom. This conference should work out the measures for im-

plementing these steps ideologically, politically, and organization-
ally. What remains then to be asked as the ﬁnal question is:

7. What, can we accomplish?

We believe that our Labor "Youth League will accomplish a
great deal. We say this modestly, without setting for ourselves
grandiose objectives. We remember what was accomplished by
the Young Communist League during the ’30’s. We are inspired
by this heritage even though we do not propose to develop our
League in the pattern of the Y.C.L. The Y.C.L. of the ’30’s, as an
arm of the working class of our country, succeeded in affecting
the course of history and the development of a whole generation
of youth. Because it devoted itself to the working class and to the
progress of our nation, because it conducted education and action
in the spirit of socialism, the Y.C.L. was able to knock the props
out from under the attempts of fascist demagogues to build a mass
youth movement in our_ country modeled after the Hitler Youth.
The Y.C.L. was able "to pioneer in the development of the broad
movement for youth security, against fascism, and for peace that
embraced in one form or another the largest section of young
Americans, and that made itself felt in the ﬁght for freedom in
Spain and on the anti—fascist battleﬁelds of World War II. In fact,
the inﬂuence of the Y.C.L. is still felt in the people’s leaders that

‘liabilities because we have conﬁdence in the youth of our country and

 their democratic traditions. , We intend fully to meet our ,re;p-r
ponsibilities to the youth, to our country, to the working class

 and to humanity. Our League 'will inspire young. people with a

, proudconsciousness that they represent the future. It will inspire 

young people with a conviction that our generation will see America
live up to its past’ traditions in the ﬁght for liberty and move ahead;
that our generation will see the people of our country bridle and
defeat the clique of warmongers who defame thevvvname of America;
The League that we project today wil be born in the conﬁdence
that ours is the ‘generation that will not only see peace and victory
over fascism, but will see our country as a land of free and equal

people, a land of socialism.

We are conﬁdent that our. organization will meet its responsi-

the election of a permanent leadership, and other important mat,-S

Vters. However, in our opinion, the charter} building drive shouldm

get underway at once and go full-steam ahead. When the founding
convention is held, it should already represent clubs which are
thriving and playing a full role in the life of the youth in shops,

‘communities, and on the campuses.

To this end, we propose that a temporary national leadership——
an organizing committee——be elected here, and guide itself by the
decisions arrived at in this conference. It should be authorized to
establish a regular publication, to organize campaigns, to develop
an educational program, to plan cultural and sport activities, to raise
funds, and so on.

Until a name is chosen at the founding convention, we propose
that the movement we build be known as the “National Organizing
Conference for a Labor Youth League.”

We eight youth leaders who make these proposals believe that
they reflect the thinking that has brought us together here, and
that they will advance our common purpose.

We understand that purpose to be the building of an organiza-
tion of a special kind, whose reason for being will be clear from
the outset. On the day of its birth it will already have deep roots
in the past and present struggles of the American workers, and an
outlook on the struggles of the future. It will be dedicated to help-
ing young Americans meet their responsibilities and fulﬁll their

_ highest hopes. It will be endowed at birth with conﬁdence, drawn

from the invincible strength of the millions who are everywhere
moving forward for lasting peace, democracy, and Socialism.

This is what we have in mind in offering for your consideration
the following draft Statement of Principles:

(The Labor Youth League) works for a peaceful, secure
. and happy life for every young American—worker, student,
veteran, farmer. ,

It educates youth in a spirit of devotion to the working
people. It bases its program on the proposition that the needs
and desires of the youth are bound up inseparably with the
immediate and fundamental interests of the working class.
It recognizes the working class as the source of progress in the
modern world, as the defender of the democratic traditions
of our country, as the force capable of ‘assuring lasting peace.
Therefore, it stimulates interest in and study of Marxism,
and educates youth in the principles of Scientiﬁc Socialism-
the beacon—light and historic goal of the working class.

(The Labor Youth League) at all times promotes the co-
operation and unity of American youth, Negro and white,
to improve their daily lives and advance their democraticlas-
pirations. It organizes young people irrespective of sex", color,
national origin, or religious belief. It strives to enrich their
lives, build their characters, train them for leadership-—pro-
moting both study and action, providing cultural, social and
sport activities.

(The Labor Youth League) stands against the big business
tycoons whose system exists by war and human misery. It
opposes Wall Street’s preparations for a third world war. It
opposes reaction’s drive to fascism. It opposes all efforts to
militarize America’s young people and to poison their minds.
It combats every form of chauvinism, war mongering, white

 

supremacy, religious bigotry, anti—Semitism, labor-baiting '

AN ORGANIZATION THAT ARISES OUT OF THE DEEPEST

NEEDS OF YOUNG AMERICANS

The need for an organization such.‘ as this grows out of the
deepest needs and most pressing problems of young Americans.
More and more young men and women are asking why, in our great
land, they confront a rising tide of militarism, joblessness, denial
of democratic rights, and lynch violence.

What’s wrong? What’s happening to our country? i ,
Only a few years back, at the end of World War II, the hopes
of young Americans were at their brightest. Here, at last, was
peace. Here was a chance for security in a country unravaged
by war. Here was the prospect of expanding democracy on the
wings of the victory won over the racists and the fascists.

But the giant proﬁts piled up by Wall Street during the war
——while American soldiers bravely joined our allies in battle against.
Hitler and Tojo—did not and could not add to the well—being of
the American people. That is not the way the capitalist system_
(whose sheep’s clothing is called “free enterprise”) works. Under
capitalism—where the factories, the mines, and the farms are owned
by a handful of exploiters—nothing proceeds unless its motive is
ever greater proﬁts for the few, unless its purpose is making the
rich richer. A

It was therefore in no way an accident that before World War
II was even over, U.S. imperialism opened up an all—out gssault
on the living standards of the people, which led to the unprece-
dented wave of strikes at the beginning of 1946. Likewise, it was
in no way an accident that U.S. imperialism aggressively moved to
secure its advantage over its weakened rivals.

U.S. imperialism hassubstituted its claims to “world'leadership”
and “the American Century” for Hitler’s “Deutschland uber Alles!”
Under these slogans, decorated with boundless demagogy of a
“Save the World for Democracy” stamp, it is seeking to conquer
the world. Whereas in the 30’s Wall Street endorsed the anti-
Communist rantings of Hitler and actively supported policies that
led to World War II, it has today taken for itself the main role of
violent opposition to every progressive, democratic, and Socialist
expression of the people in every corner of the earth. For Hitler’s
anti-Comintern pact, it has its North Atlantic Pact. For Hitler’s
Reichstag Fire Trial, it has its frame-up of the Communists on
Foley Square. Faced with world-wide resistance to its drive for
conquest, U.S. imperialism is unmistakably trying to move heaven
and earth to‘ unleash a third world war. It is smashing F.D.R.’s_
“Grand Design” for peace. Truman, Acheson, and Dulles are
proving again what Hoover, Dawes and, Bullitt once helped Hitler
to prove: namely, that the monopolies, rising from capitalism in its
imperialist or ﬁnal stage, want war and fear peace. As a result,
our nation, our people, our youth face a threat from Wall Street
today which is far greater than that fostered by any enemy in
our country’s history.

For young people, this Wall Street war drive is in the most direct

sense a design for death, for destruction-in the millions! Despite
the loud and boastful talk of aged and atom-happy, billionaires,
there is hardly a. young person who doesn’t feel in his or her
bones what being a soldier in another war would mean. Nor can
there be any doubt that if young America—despite its noble demo-
cratic heritage—were blinded into ﬁghting Wall Street’s projected
aggressive war, it would earn for itself the hatred and contempt that
decent human beings once felt for the young “supermen” of Nazi
Germany.

Filled with foreboding as to the consequences of the war schemes,
American youth is already victimized by the very processof the

imperialists’ preparations for war. America has peacetime conscrip- ‘

tion for the very first time. Young people are being screened for
compulsory army service by witch—hunting “loyalty” checkers-
who openly welcome K.K.K.ers, but suggest courts martial or
work camps for anyone who believes peace possible or who chal-
lenges-»-Jim Crow.

The war preparations have moved in on young workers in the
factories—intensifying exploitation and speed-up to a murderous
pitch, and in many branches of industry spurring on widespread
layoffs and unemployment. Militarism has taken over (or bought
with large grants) an over-riding hold on much of the educational
system—making over arts and sciences curricula into education
for death. _ H

Furthermore, the monumental war budget has made a mockery
of the most elementary needs of youth in respect to housing, health,

W‘ education, and unemployment insurance,

The system that creates the danger of war is also the system
that breeds disastrous economic crises. In fact, it is capitalism’s in-
ability, by its very nature, to prevent the crisis—and the effort of
the monopolies to make the people bear the burden of the crisis——
that is further stimulating Wall Street’s drive to world conquest
and its preparations for a new world war. William Z. Foster,
chairman of the Communist Party, put the matter with striking
clarity in his brilliant statement in defense of the Party and its in-
dicted leaders: the Wall Street leaders know, he said, “that if that
war-scare should die down and they were no longer able to get
billions and billions in munitions orders from the government,
then their sick industrial system would collapse overnight into a
terriﬁc economic crisis.”

Today, a new economic crisis is beginning in our country. So
bloated did the monopolists’ industrial system grow during World
War II, that even armaments production and Marshall Plan dump-

8

 

 

 
 

 

ing fall far short as patch-work instruments for delaying and dis- '

guising the developing crisis. The steady rise in unemployment,
the continued downward trends in industrial production, in manu-
facturers’ sales as well as retail sales—the fact that steel production
has slipped 6 percent in the last two months——these factors among
others show that the capitalist economy is in serious straits.

Along with imperialist war and fascism, depression has the direst
meaning for the youth. Many of us here do not remember the early
30’s—but one can be sure that wherever 150 young people from
average American homes gather, there are those among them who
can point to mementos of the 30’s: deformities caused by child-
hood rickets, bad teeth, or subtler consequences such as disrupted
family relationships, etc. It is a matter of record that 72 percent
of all young men who reported for the draft in 1948, could not be
taken because of heart disease, eye defects, so—called “psycho-Q
neurotic disorders,” etc.

Today, the numbers of jobless youth _who already have nowhere
to turn for the slightest measure of assistance are rapidly multiply-
ing. The New York Times in one of its many stories about climb-
ing unemployment insurance and relief rolls, calmly writesthe fol-
lowing:

“The number of veterans seeking 52-20 beneﬁts under the Cl.
Bill of Rights was_ lower this year than the last, but officials be-
lieve this due to exhausting of the right to further payment.”

Of the }é million veterans who have received 52-20 beneﬁts,
more than 1,040,000 have exhausted their beneﬁts. The $20 is the
only means of support for another million. _

Just one symptom of the times is what has happened in a
GE. plant in Bridgeport, half of whose approximately 8,000 em-
ployees were young workers, Negro and white: layoffs have com-
pletely pushed out these youth. A further symptom of the times
is what is happening to the teen-agers, who are pouring out of
schools and can neither ﬁnd jobs nor qualify for unemployment
beneﬁts.

Worst of all is what is happening to the Negro youth who were
the ﬁrst to begin suffering the job squeeze. The majority of those"
wholwere in industry have already been forced out. Many Negro
youth in city after city have been out of work without any let-up
for 4 months, 6 months, 11 months and longer.

The latest navy recruiting advertisement keeps up with the
times when it callously proclaims: No layoffs, no pay-cuts, join the
Navy. _,
