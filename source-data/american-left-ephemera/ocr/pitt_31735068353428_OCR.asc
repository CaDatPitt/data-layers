THE UNION’S statement
termed the quota - program;
which has been in effect since
1958, a failure.

It assailed the quotas as not
sufficiently rest r i c t i v e, for
having failed to revive the
U. S. lead-zinc mining industry,
and for failure to give prefer-

ence to imports from countries .

-with adequate wage standards.

In addition to the proposed
metal subsidies and protection
against brass mill imports,
other key points in the in-
dustry program were enact-
ment of a federal mine safety
bill for metalminers;
retirement at age 60 for non-
ferrous metals industry Work-
ers; establishment of a Unit-
ed Nations Bank to acquire
surplus metals and use them

in development programs for-

underdeveloped countries; ne-
gotiation of international
commodity agreements in cop-
per, lead and zinc; more fed-
eral research on new uses-of

Crisis Action
DENVER—A national
gathering of staff mem-
bers called to deal with
the metals industry
crisis convened here Jan.
25 as the Mine-Mill Un-
ion went to press.

Main attention of the
field leaders was focused
on the national and in-
dustry program _ adopted.
by the International ex-
ecutive board at its

.meeting the previous
week. Methods of trans-
lating the program into
action in the communi-
ties were stressed. '

The staff members
were also set to discuss
increased legislative- ac-
tivity of the local unions
on national, state and
area levels especially as
related to the fight for
job security, and other
union problems.

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
    
  
 
 
 
    

 

 

 

DENVE‘R—-A comprehensive program calling for im-
mediate measures to haltthe nation’s present economic
slump was projected here Jan. 23 in sea statement issued

by Mine-Mill’s International Executive ‘Board.’ Also urged :

were additional laws to strengthen the -basic economic
structure of the country as wellas measures to promote ‘
full recovery in the non-ferrous metals industry. .
Adoption of the .program highlighted a five-day
meeting of the board at the union’s International ‘head-
quarters. While the main concern of the Mine-Mill lead-
ers was the deepening crisis in. non-ferrous ‘metals;
their review of current trends recognized that many of“
-the industry’s—prob1ems stemmed from the general eco-
nomic recession now besetting the country. c .
In this connection, the union officers called on the
new Administration and Congress‘ ‘.‘to supply needed
emergency action to prevent further economic'de_terio_1'a-, _
tion, to stabilizeand invigoratefthe economy, to preserve
the vitally needed non-ferrous metals industry, and to
provide a fuller, richer and more meaningful life for, all
of the American people.” ' i ' ‘ ‘
Included among the board’s' recommendations, on '
legislation for the new Congress .were a wide range. of.
proposals .-covering unemployment compensation, hous-. L

ing and construction, taxes, depressed areas, social se-  ,,

curity, minimumwages and further measures for build-
mg a sound economy and a better:America. ' . i 1

Following is the legislative program adopted by -the
Executive board: ,  ,

Immediate Measures

To provide immediate relief for our ailing economy;
we urge immediateenactment.of these measures: ' '

UNEMPLOYMENT; COMPENSATION
Several states now face near exhaustion of their
unemployment trust funds; in most others present bene-
fits are too small to have any significant economic effect.
A two-step program is called for: First, the providing

-of emergency funds to enable all states to continue to

pay unemployment benefits and to extend the duration
of benefits; second, at the earliest possible opportunity
after ‘emergency funds have been made available, the
establishment of basic Federal unemployment insurance
standards to provide benefits of at least one-half of em-
ployee’s earnings for periods-up to 39 Weeks. .

Another Vindication ot Mine-Mill

WASHINGTON, D. C.——
The Supreme Court of the
United States Jan. 16 wrote
“finish” to the Travis case.

By a vote of 6 to 3, ‘the
high tribunal threw out the
former Mine-Mill secretary-
treasurer’s conviction on
charges of falsifying Taft-
Hartley non-Communist affi-

davits in 1951 and ’52.

Final reversal of the convic-
tion was hailed by the union’s
top officers as “another vindi-
cation of Mine-Mill - and its
leadership against unjust
charges of communism and
years of legal harassment.”

THE COURT ruled that
Travis had been improperly

rgency

indicted and tried. In basing
its dismissal on the one issue
of venue out of some eight
which it had accepted for re-
view, the Court eliminated the
need for ruling on any of the
others since the decision on
that point conclusively bars
any re-trial of the case.

Thus ‘ends the 61/2-year-long

who left the union in 1955. The
decision once more bears out

the repeatedly expressed con-. .

tention of the officers and
membership that the charges
against him and the union
were false and could not stand
up.

It was the Supreme Court’s
second major repudiation of
‘such charges against the un-

ion and its officials, the first,

being in the 1957 reversal of
the case against former staff.
member Clinton E. J encks.

THE ONLY two convictions
ever handed down against
Mine -Mill personnel, Jencks
and Travis, for allegedly
signing false T-H non-Cont
munist affidavits. have now
been thrown out by the high-
est court in the land.

Victory in the Travis case
also marks the third time in a

‘ row that the courts have vindi-

cated Mine-Mill against T-II
affidavit attacks and cleared
the union of “communism?
charges.

Call-Out Time
Arbitration Won

A grievance involving the
issue of pay for call-out time
, was won recently by Local 72
at AS&R in East Helena,
Mont., in a decision handed
down’ by Arbitrator Howard
Durham.
' Melvin Mahr, regularly
‘scheduled day shift worker in
the Yard‘ department, was
‘ called out to work the after-

noon blast furnace shift on.

at Saturday, April 23. He had
been off Friday with permis-
sion and his regular days off
were Saturday and Sunday.
The company contended it
was not an emergency and he
was not entitled to -his call-
out premium because he
hadn’t worked 40 hours that
. week. The union’s position
was that it was an emergency
and that under the contract
he should get premium pay.
The case was heard by
Arbitrator Durham last Nov.
11. Representing the union
were attorney Charles V.
’Huppe along with John Fonk,
“Larry White, Matt Vook, Tony

Connell, Cub Baer and Int’l«

Rep. George Kalafitch.

last month, stated that the

TACOMA, Wash.——Tacoma
smeltermen saw a dream
come true with the recent dedi-
cation here of their new Mine-
Mill Local 25 union hall. Inter-
national President John Clark
was on hand to participate in
the celebration.

Construction of the new

headquarters has been dis-
cussed by the members ever
‘since the union purchased two
city blocks back in 1950, but
for one reason or another the
building program never got
off the ground. Early last
Spring, however, determina-
tion of the local officers to
realize the dream got the pro-
gram moving.

Plans were drawn and, after

final approval, the contract
was let for construction and
the building was completed in
’December. The formal dedica-
tion was held Dec. 17, with
President Clark as principal
speaker.

Vice-President Al Skinner,
District 7 Board Member
Chase Powers and Regional
Director Jim Daugherty were
also scheduled to participate,
but were unable to attend be-
cause they were tied up in the
Coeur d’Alene AS&R negotia-
tions. They called during the
ceremonies to congratulate the
local and announce settlement

~ of the AS&R contract.

cluded Pete Piekarski, Kenny

company failed to adhere. to
the contract in not adequately
compensating Mahr, and or-
dered that he “be paid the re-
quired premium amounting to

four times the applicable
hourly rate of pay at that
time.”

Baltimore Beet
Gains Back Pay - ’ 

Local 625 member Claudy
Smith is $330 richer as a re-
sult of his grievance won by
the union at the Baltimore
AS&R plant.

Some time ago Smith went
home ill. When he returned
to work the company doctor
told him to get an okay from
his family doctor to return to
the job. He did, and was then
instructed by "the company
doctor to get an electrocardio-

‘ graph run at the hospital;

After doing this he was again
stalled off by the company.
The union demanded full
pay for all time lost caused
by management's refusal to
return him to work. Finally,
on Dec. 14, the company
agreed to compensate Smith
in the amount of $330. He had
already returned to work in
the middle of October.
District 6 Board Member
A1 Petit-Clair assisted the local
committee in the top-level
grievance.

Ill :14 II!

IN LINE with‘ the jobs
fight, the delegates pinpoint-
ed a national program for so-
cial legislation to prop the
economy. It calls for: ~

A vast program of housing,

schools, road building and hos- '

pitals; adequate educational
and medical aid; increased
and extended unemployment
benefits; $1.50 hourly mini-
mum wage; aged medical care
through social security; age
60 eligibility -for social se-
curity; $1,000 tax exemption
for each member in a family;
a 30-hour week at 40 hours’

pay under federal law; and.

guaranteed civil rights for
all.

Discussion pointed up the
serious impact of automation
resulting in widespread unem-
ployment and situations where
thousands of laid off Workers
face exhausted unemployment
benefits and no jobs to be had.

Lay-offs have hit men up
to 18 years seniority at Buf-
falo ABC and 22 "years at
Greenfield smelting.

THESE FACTS were de-
tailed in communications ad-
dressed by the PAC group to
New York’s U.S. Senators
Javits and Keating and Con-

gressmen Dulski, Miller and.

Pillion. The letters stressed
the need for social legislation
as outlined in the union’s
program, -and urged the legis-

Test Cases    

Pay Off for
Pensioners

BUFFALO, N.Y.—Mine-Mill

has won two important -test  

cases here over the State
Labor Dept.’s disqualification
of retired Local 593 members
for jobless benefits. Both‘in-.
volved American Brass Com-
pany pensioners. "

As a result, A
trimmer helper Dan Artemink
received a lump-sum total of
$1,150 in back benefits for 21
weeks and former crane opera-
tor George Wojciechowski is
to get $1,300 for 26 weeks.

Broader importance of these
victories lies in the fact that
several other cases won recent-
ly by the union before ref-
erees are pending under ap-
peal of the Industrial Com-

missioner to the vN.Y. State,

Unemployment Insurance Ap-
peal Board. .
ARTEMINK had asked the
company for lighter work be-
cause his arduous job was af-
fecting his health..When the
company refused on the

grounds it had no other work "

available he could do, he left
and sought employment else-
where. On filing for unemploy-

ment benefits, he Was dis-

qualified by the Labor Dept.’s

Buffalo office which said "he

left voluntarily without good
cause.

A hearing before the Dept.’s
Unemployment Insurance Ref-
eree Section resulted Nov.
4 in a decision upholding the

union’s position that Artemink ,

left his employment with

good cause and over-ruling his -.

disqualification for benefits.

WOJCIECHOWSKI was‘

similarly disqualified by the

Buffalo Labor Dept. office for,
leaving his job without good,

The union called for a. hear-
ing before a referee and won,
the referee over-ruling both

counts of Wojciechowski’s dis-
qualification for benefits. _
The Industrial Commission- _

THE-« MINE-MILL UNION

. Februqry, ‘I7

C: Secretary-Treasurer:

Union Program Cites

Basic Needs—Dichter

ABOR could use a much better deal than it was

handed over the past eight years under the-Eisen-
hower administration. For eight long years labor has
taken one wallop after another in Washington.

In the early years of Republican rule, there was the .

resignation of Martin Durkin of the Plumb-
ers Union, who had been appointed Secretary
of Labor as window dressing. Durkin couldn’t
take it any longer after the administration
reneged on promises to him to remove by
amendment some of the worst provisions of
the Taft-Hartley law. Then came the replace-
ment one-by—one of the Democratic-appointed

panel of anti-labor, pro-employer members.

-The years that followed saw the failure
of attempts to broaden the coverage and im-
' _ " prove the standards of the minimum wage
mchter ’ law, and to establish uniform federal stand-
ards to which state unemployment compensation laws would

    

h.ave to conform. Capping it all wereitwo Presidential vetoes '

of the Douglas aid-to-depressed-areas bills and passage of the
infamous Landrum-Griffin act.

watt

ES—it’s way past time for a change. The same economic

- and social philosophy that was behind this sorry recordon
labor is responsible for the mess we’ve drifted into in foreign
affairs, and on the home front.

President Kennedy takes office as the worst winter unem-
ployment of nearly twenty years is upon us. Stagnation in
industry, housing, mining—and the gold crisis-—these are the
legacy of the outgoing administration to the new.

On page one of this issue of Mine-Mill Union are two very
important stories about the Federal Legislative Program which
has just been adopted by Mine-Mill’s Executive Board. All of
this is realistic, down-to-earth, and in general consistent with
Democratic campaign promises, and with the expert reports that
have been submitted to President Kennedy recently.

* ‘k *
CAN’T run through the whole list of lmeasures——you should

read them on page one—but I want to give you the thinking
behind some of our more important recommendations for im-

mediate relief measures and steps to strengthen our basic eco- "

nomic structure. 1 P _ 5 ,

The shorter work week with no loss in take-home pay, and
optional retirement under Social Security at age 62 for men and
60 for ‘women are tremendously important in times like this-
the first means more jobs, the second would offer older workers
a wider range of choice as to time of retirement.

In badly depressed areas it would be a lifesaver for laid
off older workers who would otherwise be on the unemploy-
ment rolls. The proposal for full retirement for miners at age
60 is on a different principle; it gives recognition to the specially
hazardous, unhealthy ‘and physically wearing nature of mining
employment.

*at*

HIS is no pie-in-the-sky proposal — early retirement for

miners has been endorsed for years by the International
Labor Office and wide sections of the clergy. Early retirement
for miners is now a fact in Albania, Bulgaria, France, Rumania
and the USSR at age 50; in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Japan and
the Netherlands at 55; in Luxembourggat 58, and in Australia,
Poland and Greece at age 60.

The current fight over unemployment compensation in Mon-

A t-ana underscores the need. to establish basic Federal unemploy-

ment insurance standards. Here is the great state of Montana,

with a maximum 015-22 weeks duration for unemployment com- A

pensation, and a maximum weekly benefit of $32. These are
among the poorest standards of any state, and stick out_like
a sore thumb in the West. And right now the Montana Chamber
of Commerce is trying to ram through the legislature a series

of amendments designed to cut outlays for unemployment com-.

pensation in Montana in half.

. The Montana Mine-Mill Legislative Committee, the State
AFL-CIO and other groups are fighting to save the pitifully
inadequate program now on the books. We ask for federal
standards that will pull Montana and all other states up to
reasonable standards and make it impossible for employer
groups to stage raids like this on the state level.

‘k*‘k -

INE safety is another area where federal action is needed

because of the failure of the states to push their mine
safety programs.

Only in the United States and Canada among progressive
industrial countries do we have such extreme decentralization of
authority for insuring safety in the mining industry, and gen-
erally inadequate enforcement. Accident rates in metal mining

‘ are among the highest in U. S. industry; nearly three times the

U. S. average for disabling injuries; more than four times the
U. S. average for time lost due to injuries. ,

Silicosis is a continuing hazard in mining. The record is
bad enoughlalready to call for immediate federal action in the

Travis Decision Cheered at 

Cdnacla District Conventiontiifl.

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

‘VANCOUVER, B. C.———A roaring, foot—stamping demonstration brought the.dele-..

. gates to the Canadian Western District Union convention to their feet here when 

Western District President Murphy read the wire announcing the release of Maurice: i ,
Travis, former International secretary—treasurer. The meeting was unanimous in pass-
im a wire expressing this section’s joy and satisfaction, . C

ing a standing vote to send h

pledging aid to the other
victims, and expressing
confidence that they too
would soon be freed from the
trumped—up charges laid un-
der a vicious law.

On the first day of the con-
vention the delegates heard
from the Hon. L. Peterson,
newly- appointed minister of
labour. As he had not yet had
time to take up his duties, his
speech was necessarily gen-
eral, but he dealt at some
length on the need for more
training and - education of
workers now suffering a vaca-
tion lmder enforced unemploy-
ment. -

“Unemployment is far too
high,” he said, and suggested,
as well as retraining and edu-
cational effort, the increase of
capital investment and fur-

therance of public works to

combat it.
>1‘ #4 *

“IT IS the problem, of all
governments at all levels,” ‘he

declared with emphasis, and

this alonewas significant, as
it cannot be remembered that
any other provincial cabinet
minister at any time admitted
to a responsibility which has
always been charged by them
to the senior government and
its “hard money policies.”
Much regret was expressed

over the inability of Interna-

~ tional officers to attend due to

their meeting in Denver, but
the national executive and the
executive of District 2 in the
east, as well as the leader-
ship of Sudbury Local 598
were ably represented by
Canadian National President
Ken Smith, Nels Thibault and
Mike Solsky, and Don Gillis
and Brother Hogan of Local
598.

Brother Gillis gave a resume
of events since he took office

and gave an encouraging re--
.port on the improving finan-

cial condition of his local fol-
lowing the great INCO strike,
thanking all locals here and
elsewhere for the support
which had made such a quick
monetary recovery possible.

Hamish McKay, recently de-
ported from the U.S. Where he
has lived all his life because
he joined an unemployed or-
ganization in the last depres-
sion, shocked the Canadians
with his recital of the in-
justices, repression, and in-
timidation wrought by the
Walter-Mccarran Act u n d er
which he was exiled.-

THE OFFICERS’ report
criticized the lack of leader-
ship given by the chiefs of

the Canadian Labour- Con- .
gress to the workers of -the
country, and their subservi-. ‘
ence to anti—labour opinions ‘
and policies. K . .

“It’s time they took a second
look at what is taking place,”
said the forthright document, ; -
“and realized that they are the
paid servants of those whom
they are supposed to lead.’_’ ‘ ‘

THE PRESSING and subtle ,
attack on Labour in Canada “ C ‘
was also emphasized, and the
workers were warned against ,
letting - press and political 
propaganda have any impres-
sion on them, as it had had on
"some, to the extent that-of-
ficers of the CLC"‘are.nowa
following the policies of John
Foster Dulles.” ‘ ,  _

Canada’s role of following‘
the Pentagon in worthlessi ~
military expenditures for “de-
fense,” ‘instead of takingan _
independent stand for peace , ‘ ‘
was stringently resented. So
also were some of the claims
of the “New Party” to repre-
sent labour in Canada. - _

The union reaffirmed its
position of freedom from en-
tanglement with any party, .
but tosupport any candidate - -
or policy favorable to the‘

Building the record in the
Travis case from the very
start, Witt prepared the final
appeal briefs together with
General Telford Taylor who
presented the defense argu-
ment before the Supreme
Court, last Dec. 13. ,

Speaking on behalf of the

also expressed confidence of
similar victory in the other
legal cases still pending.

“We are supremely confi-

HAYDEN, lAriz.—An ener-
getic political action program
designed to take its leaders to
the state capitol as a steering
committee for stepped-up local
union legislative activities was
adopted here Jan. 8 by the
Arizona Mine-Mill Council.

Twenty seven delegates at-
tended the meeting of the
Council which represents 10
locals throughout the state.

In addition to developing
their program on the state leg-

islative front, , the delegates“
elected 1961 officers and-heard’

talks by prospective candidates
for the congressional seat va-
cated by Rep. Stewart Udall
(D., Ariz.), new Interior Sec-
retary in President Kennedy’s

cabinet.
>l= =3 *1‘

MAJOR P OI N T S of the
Council program call for:

0 Changes in the state min-
ing code to increase the num-
ber of deputies in the Mine
Inspector’s office;

0 Assisting the Mine Inspec-
tor’s department to gain more
funds for carrying out the
services of theFofficeA;" -

CO Appearances at commit-
tee hearings when bills sup-
ported or opposed by the un-
ion come upin the legislature;

0 Increased involvement of
the local unions in contacting
legislators before bills come
up for vote.

0 A special meeting of the
Council in the state capitol to
bring added emphasis to the
union’s program.

0 Issuance of a Council Bul-
letin for keeping the local
members informed on Council
activities.

To supply necessary funds-
for carrying out the program,
the Council voted a “single
shot” one-month per capita
payment of 25 cents per mem-
ber for January. 1

still necessary with the repre-
sentatives f r o In non-mining

objective, C o u n e il Chairman,

III I C
FURTHER discussing the
union’s various meetings with
county senators and represen-

inspection for

e tatives, as well as with Gov-

ernor Paul Fannin, Int’l Rep.
Frank Vettorel asserted:
“With a gross income of the
copper industry of nearly $345
million and taxes of $17 mil-
lion to the state of Arizona,
it is outrageously cruel to
have a State Mine Inspector’s
department to be appropriated

only $48,075 with a jurisdic-

tion of over 180 mines, 42
mills, 11 smelters and nearly
20,000 workers producing 540,-
000 tons per year.”

Vettorel said that “annual
reports of the Inspector show
he is not making any inspec-

tions of the mills and smelters
and also admits that his pres-
ent staff of three deputies and
one dust-control man can only
work 10 to l2.days per month
because of lack of funds.”

Vettorel also pointed to
statements by state and in-
dustry o f f i c i al s predicting
further increases in Arizona
copper production.

“It is the state goVernment’s
responsibility,’’, the Mine-Mill
staff member said, “to keep
up with this fast-moving min-
ing industry with its increased
output, new mining methods,
faster drilling, lo adin g and
conveying, and the handling of
ores and materials in the mills
and smelters of the state.

Steps -must be taken by our"

union this year to insure ade-
quate protection against work

injuries and diseases for the
workers who make this indus-
try prosper.”

  UCC Appeals Court
Decision on Strkers' Benefits

HELENA, Mont.—A district court decision which the state’s Unemployment Com-
pensation Commission chairman said would in effect provide jobless benefits to strikers
is being appealed by the UCC to the Montana Supreme Court. The 3—man commission
voted 2-1 here Jan. 9 to make the appeal.

The issue grew out of Mine-Mill’s 1959 — 60 strike against the Anaconda Company

was taken in the courts with
union attorney Charles V.
Huppe handling all the cases
for the claimants involved.

On Jan. 4 District Judge W.
W. Lessley of Bozeman hand-
ed down decisions reversing
the UCC’s denial of claims on
29 of the cases and upholding
the commission on 15 others.
Where the UCC was over-
ruled by. the court, the com-
mission was ordered to pay the
“benefits due.” The cases
were the first of their kind-
decided in Montana.

UCC Chairman Donald Mac-

Pherson told reporters; “Un-3

less these decisions are ap—‘
pealed, they could set a prece-
dent wherein strikers could
receive‘ unemployment bene-
fits.” -
=l<' -=l< =l€

IN REPLY, union attorney
Huppe declared: ’

“The simple truth is that
the commission majority was"
so zealous in its desire to as-
sist the Anaconda Company
during the strike that it sim-
ply misinterpreted the law.
The court has corrected this,
in at least 29 of the cases.”
He added that the commis-
sion’s Cmistake caused the
claimants to wait more than
a year to have benefits avail-
able to them.

Meanwhile, Judge Jack R.
Loucks of Wolf Point also
reversed the UCC on two more
similar claims and upheld the
commission on 12 others. Ad-
ditional cases are still pending
decisions.

The effort has been sup-
ported by Mine-Mill, which

try’s representatives on this
group. It should be strength-
ened and also broadened to in-
clude copper.

0 Expand appropriations to

and on new and more economi-
cal methods for the discov-

. ery and exploitation of lower

0 Remove present unreal-g

istic restrictions on U. S. ex-
ports o-f metals and metal
products which impose qualifi-
cations based on the type of
government or economic sys-
tem with which we deal.
COPPER

To avert a disastrous cur-
tailment of production and em;
ployment in copper mining
such as occurred in 1958, we
propose the enactment of a
government copper subsidy, to
support 1,000,000 tons per
year of newly-mined domestic
copper at a guarantee. of the
producer of 27 té cents per
pound, —with a maximum on
the amount of subsidy, based
on recent production, to any
one company.

This program would be in-
operative at existing price
levels, but would be available
on a standby basis to go into
action if further deterioration
were to take place.

LEAD AND ZINC

The government’s import
quota program for lead and
zinc has been a failure.

After two years. of opera-
tion the quotas have not suf-
ficiently restricted heavy im-
ports from low-wage areas nor
have they brought about any
significant revival of our
domestic mining industry.
They have, in addition, served
to curtail production at many
smelters unable to fill their
ore requirements from domes-
tic sources.

Theoperation of the quota
system has been additionally
unsatisfactory because the
quotas were not allocated
among exporting countries _. in
accordance with Mine-Mill's
proposed preferential. treat-

ment for imports from coun- "
 tries‘ -"Wi‘?'h- f-

be little prospect of improv-
ing the quota system in either
"direction.

We recommend, therefore, 9 a
new approach to the lead—zinc
problem embodying—

0 Abolition of the lead-zinc
import quotas.

0 An industry-wide subsidy
for domestic lead-zinc mine
production.

The subsidy would apply, as-

was proposed by. the Eisen-
hower Administration in 1958,
to an annual production of
350,000 tons of lead and 550,-
000 tons of zinc. Subsidies

* should be paid to guarantee a

return to mine producers
equivalent to what they would
receive if lead were at 15
cents and zinc at 14 cents per
pound.

Again, as in the case of cop-
per, the amount of subsidy
available to any one company
would be limited, based on re-
cent production. ‘

This dual approach should
increase domestic mine pro-
duction of lead and zinc by
about 100,000 tons per year
each above recent levels, and
further increase output at
smelters by removing quota
limitations on imports.

BRASS
We favor adequate protec-
tion against imports from

abroad to restore 2,000 to 2,500
brass mill jobs to American
workers.

INDUSTRY NOTES

Kcnnccott Settles in Chile

BRADEN COPPER 00., Chilean subsidiary of Kennecott
Copper Co. agreed to a new 15-month contract with 7,000 workers
at the company’s big copper mine early last month. The agree-
ment, retroactive to January 1, runs to March 31, 1962. Agree-
ment was reached just before a strike deadline rescheduled for
January 8, after having been set originally for January 2.

After weeks of fruitless negotiation between the company
and the Chilean Copper Workers Confederation, during which
the company held steadfast to an offer of a pay -increa_se of no
more than 3.2 to 3.8 percent, the Chilean government stepped
into the picture. It asked the union to postpone the strike for
a week and promised to try to Work out “reasonable” contract
terms.

After postponement of- the strike, President Alessandri of

Chile and his labor and finance ministers (corresponding to the
U. S. Secretaries of Labor and Treasury) personally intervened
in the dispute. They were anxious to avert a strike which would
mean an important tax loss to the government.

Settlement terms include a 15 percent pay boost, plus a. one-
time bonus payment to every worker equivalent to about $135,
and increased fringe benefits. ’

Settlement of the dispute was followed immediately by
weakening of copper prices in the New York futures market

and the London Metal Exchange. This was followed by cuts in ,

ZINC took a new jolt January 3 from the St. Joseph Lead
Company, which announced that until further notice it would
sell zinc at discount of $10 per ton, or 1/2 cent per pound below
the St. Louis price. Following two cuts of 1/; cent each in Decem-
ber, the effective price with the discount is now 111/; cents per
pound. ' ' '

St. Joe said some of its customers -had reported discount
offers by other sellers of U. S. produced zinc, and that it took
this step in order to “meet competition.” Toward the middle" of
the month, other sellers lowered their prices to 111/2 cents,‘fol-
lowing which sellers generally gave up the practice of discounts.

AN ACONDA has taken an option on claims of Mt. Wheeler
Mines, Inc. in White Pine county, Nevada, 40 miles southeast of
Ely. The option, which has two years to run, will give Anaconda
time for an expensive underground development program to
determine the extent of beryllium ore bodies known to exist at

the site. Depending On the results, Anaconda plans a multimil- 

lion dollar project to mine and refine beryllium. The family of
former President Herbert Hoover and American Zinc, Leadand
Smelting Co. have substantial interests in Mt. Wheeler mines.

INCOME TAX REVISION

' To provide additional quick-
spending money to low income
groups, the President should
be authorized to forgive the

first $10 per week of personal -

withholding taxes for as long
as such action is required.

' A thoroughgoing revision of
our basic tax structure is also
long overdue and should be at-
tended to as soon as possible.

Such revision should include
higher personal exemptions,
withholding of taxes on divi-
dend and interest income at

the source, repeal of exemp- ‘

tions and the 4 per cent tax
credit on dividend income,
elimination of capital -gains
“favoritism” and existing tax
preferences on estate and gift
taxes.

DEPRESSED AREAS

To encourage rehabilitation
of chronically depressed areas,
Congress should immediately-
enact Area Re-development leg-

I islation and other proposals
contained in the Senator Doug-
las task force report.

These proposals call for
loans for development of pri-
vate projects, loans and grants
for public facilities, for tech-
nical assistance, for training
and retraining of labor force,
raising of educational stand-
ards and many other worth-
while purposes.

SOCIAL SECURITY

An immediate 10 per cent
increase in Social Security ben-
efits—-which can be achieved
without any immediate in-
crease in taxes-«should be en-
acted.

Our Social Security system
should also be broadened to
provide health care for the
aged to include hospital, diag-
nostic, x-ray, nursing home
and home nursing benefits.
Also, as a means of providing
greater employment opportu-
nities, the permissible retire-
ment age for receipt of Old
Age Benefits should be low-'
ered to 62 years for men and
60 years for women.

It is time our country pro-
vided full retirement for min-
5 ers at age 60. Many countries

In addition to the above
“immediate” measures, some
of which will have lasting ben-
eficial effects, we further pro-
pose as a means of strength-
ening our basic economic struc-
ture: I

AID TO EDUCATION

Programs to provide needed
school facilities and to raise
the quality of our entire edu-
cational system should be vig-
orously pushed.

In this area, funds should be
provided for construction of
additional c l a s s r o 0 m s and
higher educational facilities,
for increasing teachers’ sal-
aries, and for scholarships to
gifted and needy students.

PUBLIC WORKS

In addition to those immedi-
ate public works projects dis-
cussed above, a long-range
program for useful and nec-
essary public works and pub-
licly supported construction
should be enacted.

Among projects to be in-

cluded would be urban renew-

al projects, low cost housing,
hospital construction, natural
resource development, water
pollution control and other
measures that are socially nec-
essary.

SHORTER WORK WEEK

A more equitable distribu-
tion of the benefits of our ad-
vanced technology calls for
enactment of a reduction of
the statutory work week now
prescribed in the Wage-Hour
Law. This should be accom-

ment at a cost that could be

FARM PROGRAM

. A realistic farm program.
geared to the needs of the fam-
ily farm should be enacted in
the coming session of Con-
gress. Such a program would
base price supports on produc-
tion payments to farmers,
with a ceiling on the maxi-
mum support for any one
farm.

A vigorous attack should be
made on the surplus problem,
with reinstitution of the food

stamp plan, a strengthened

school lunch program, broad-
ened and improved surplus
food distribution "program at
home, and intensified use of
American farm products in re-
lieving hunger and distress
abroad.

equal opportunity to all citi-
zens must be completed in this
coming session of «Congress.

What is needed in this area
are laws implementing the Su-

an effective Fair Employment
