close these possibilities. They see
world opinion and national opinion
and—increasingly—Southern opinion,
including white southern opinion,
turning against them. If these traitors
succeed forcibly in closing these pos-
sibilities, they will have dealt a severe
blow to the whole Negro liberation
movement; they will have dealt a
crippling blow to the labor move-
ment and its hopes for organizing
the South; they will have set back for
years any hope of achieving a sig-
niﬁcant political breakthrough in. our
country. If the democratic processes,
if the mode of peaceful struggle for
change, cannot ‘be kep-t open on the
Negro question, then it will be shut
on all questions of popular sig-
niﬁcance.

In this connection, the Iune 5th
decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court
—reached on the basis of a 5 to 4
split—-upholding sections of the so-
called McCarran Act in effect illegal-
izing the Communist Party, and
making membership in that Party a
criminal offense, also demonstrate a
determination on the part of ruling-
class elements to outlaw democratic
and peaceful methods of significant‘.
political strcggle. By seeking to des-
troy the Bill of Rights and outlaw
radical thinking, the reactionary
majority of the Court would under-
cut the elementary rights o-f the
American people as a whole, just as
the KKK assault would destroy the:
elementary rights of the Negro peo-
ple in particular.

 

The Ku -Klux offensive must be
beaten back, and this can be done

only by , increased boldness and
struggle; compromise emboldens the,»

traitors. What is needed is wave upon
wave of freedom riders, massively or-
ganized—for instance by -the United
Mine Workers and the United Steel
Workers and the United AutoWork-
ers, as well as by student and civil
rights and civil lib-erties groups.What
is needed is vigorous federal actions
to enforce the law and. uphold its
authority. What is needed’ is _ a
determined campaign to force civil

rights legislation through ._th;i;s~,.C_on,,-._
gress and. to insist that the .Presi,de»nt_,,
vigorously use his great_-_Exe,cutivc..;-
powers. What is needed, is protests;
from State legislatures against; Ala-.3;
bama’s violations of the rights of»

citizens—for instance, if _-the_ Gover-

nor of Mississippi can wire Governor-

Patterson words of praise why. can’t
the Governors of New York and
New Jersey and Illinois and Mich-
igan and California wire him words
of condemnation?

The voice of democratic America

must make itself heard, individually
and collectively and persistently.
Only Americans who love democracy
will save it and extend it. It is a

‘ time for great impatience,‘ for action;

IO

our country’s honor and fate depend

upon it.
On Decoration Day in 1882, the
honored speaker at Arlington Na-

tional Cemetery in Wash-'1-n_-gto-n;«was;

Frederick Douglass. (Has there. ever

been a Negro speaker at such a
ceremony in such a place since?)
Douglass said, having the recently
concluded Civil War in mind:

. . . if the American name is no
longer a by-word and a hissing to a
mocking earth, if the star—spangled
banner ﬂoats only over free American
citizens in every quarter of the land,
and our country has before it a long
and glorious career of justice, liberty,
and civilization, we are indebted to the
unselﬁsh. devotion of the noble army
who rest in these honored graves all
around us.

4 How ironic sounds Douglass’ “if”
in this,-centennial of that Civil War!
O7ne‘_ may say now, alas, that if our

II

nation’s name is not-'to be a by-word
and a hissing to a mocking earth,
such weeks as those that just blood-
stained Alabama must not recur.
With justice and liberty they will
not recur; to achieve both, they must
be present for all, everywhere, else
they are real for no one, anywhere.
The basic testing ground is the
Negro citizen in the South. Again,
as so often in our past, the so-called
Negro question—which is truly a
question of whether or not we really
mean democracy when we say it-
is the central question of our country.
If it is permitted to fester and deteri-
orate it can destroy us all; if it is
ﬁnally faced and really resolved, it
can save all of us.

 

 

WHAT MUST BE DONE
By James E. Jackson

ALABAMA mud, red with the blood
of our youth, has been spattered in
the eye of the nation by Gov. Iohn
Patterson’s Ku Klux mobsters.

Heroic Negro youth, with co~ur—
ageous young white men and W0-
men by their side, are gloriously
pushing the point o-f the developing
general offensive of the Negro peo-
ple and their white allies against the
Southern segregation system with
all of its barbarous dignity—destro-ying
and life—destroying patterns of racist
tyranny, unconscionable exploitation
and human misery.

The fu.ry of the mob reaction
against tho-se youths in Alabama,
which was promoted by the Gov-
ernor of Alabama himself, is the
measure o-f the failure o-f President
Kennedy, as of his predecessors, to
use the powers of his office to secure
to the Negro masses in the South
their court—ordered and federal law-
given rights of equality. The dis-
patch of a contingent of U.S. Mar—
shals to Montgomery was a welcome
but lusterless performance. A week
of mob—rule terror followed, after
the ﬂesh—gouging and bone—crushing
beatings suffered by Iames Peck and
the CORE~Freedom Riders in Annis—



ton, before Attorney General Robert
Kennedy was finally moved to send
U.S. marshals to stave off a threat-
ened massacre of a church gathering
of hundreds of Negroes joined by a
number of white students protesting
the continuing violation of their
rights to unsegregated travel and bus
terminal service.

How outrageous is the condition
that prevails in o-ur country! We
behold a government boastful of
its mighty powers, that ﬂexes its
military muscles and shouts in threat-
ening tones before the world that it
would order the lives of sovereign
nations, from Cuba to Laos, yet has
failed to secure the rights and defend
the liberties of 19 million of its Negro
citizens, 97 years after those rights
were proclaimed. How fraudulent
and mocking do the Government’s
“democratic free world” pretensions
sound to world public opinion!

All the democratic—minded and
justice—loving people of our nation
owe a special debt of gratitude to-
these glorious young crusaders for
our government’s lost principles, for
dramatizing the savage horror of the
Southern way of life that is the
commonplace daily reality of millions

  

of Negro citizens. Especially so be-
cause the rights they were trying to
exercise are rights which have long
since been established law, pro-
claimed by court decision and boasted
about over .the Voice of America.

They have revealed before the
nation and the world that such
elementary human and civil rights
do not exist for the millions of
Negroes in the So-uth, and that to
assert them is to risk life and limb.
And, furthermore, that the Federal
Government has taken no effective
measures to secure and enforce com-
pliance with Constitutional and hu-
man rights when the rights of the
Negro people are concerned.

All decent—minded human beings
must demand that the Administra-
tion, the Government power of the
U.S., must take up this burden now
borne on the shoulders of our valiant
youth, and by Presidential Executive
Order and sup-p-lementary urgently-
enacted civil rights laws accomplish
the total eradication of the Southern
states’ Iim Crow laws and segrega-
tion system. And put into effect at
once a federally—policed system of
controlled compliance with, and
defense of, the rights of the Negro-
citizens in the Southern states.

In their irredeemable ignorance

of the reality of the people’s power
in this age in which we live, Gov.
Faubus of Arkansas and Gov. Barnett
of Mississippi, and’ the neo—C’on—
federate states’ claque in Congress,

have pledged all—out aid to the Go-v-

I4

ernor of Alabama in his impudent
deﬁance of the laws of the nation.

In this Centennial anniversary
years of the Civil War, the neo—fascist
reactionaries see in this Ku Klux
Klan gangster Iohn Patterson a vir—
tual Robert E. Lee “gallantly” ﬁght-
ing a rearguard action of the slave-
owners’ rebellion.

So be it! Not alone the rights of
the Negro people-, but the general
welfare and interests of the nation
demand that the battle at long last
be joined‘and fought out, to the end
that the insolent insurrectionary
blackmailers of the "nation, chieftains
of white supremacy mobsters, and
perpetrators of the criminal segrega—
tion system, are totally crushed. The
Kennedy administration must know
that nothing less than unconditional
surrender of the segregation system
is acceptable. There can be no com-
p-romise of this struggle.

as as as

Let there be no truce in the offen-
sive against the segregation system.
Iim Crow must go NOW"!

Let there be full support to the
Freedom Riders and all tho-se who
summon the masses to large—scale
direct actions to put an end once
and for all to the lawless segregation
system.

Let hundreds and thousands now
join in the anti—segregation “ride—ins”
throughout the South. Let the stu—
dents, trade unionists and church
people organize such Fredom—Ride
excursions throughout the South.

Let Washington see the presence
of delegations and hear the ‘messages
of thousands of freedom-loving Am—
ericans demanding the strongest and
most immediate enforcement of the
rights of the Negro people in the

South, and for the severest measures

against the insurrectionary Dixiecrat

leaders and mobsters.
Let the State Legislatures and city
councils memorialize Congress and

the President for the enactment of
full programs for enforcing the civil
rights of the Negro people.

Let the students hold protest holi—
days, and workers picket, and the
people——Negro- and white—rally in
great meetings of solidarity with the
Southern Freedom Riders and the
just cause of thelNegro people to
secure their civil rights.

RIDING TO FREEDOM
By Herbert Aptheker

THE MONSTROUS ASSAULTS by cow-
ardly gangsters and racists upon un-
armed and non—resisting young men
and women in Alabama late in May
is the culminating act of a pre—con—
certed insurrectionary movement.
Earlier scenes were played out in
Florida, in Virginia, in Arkansas,
in Mississippi, in Louisiana. Now,
with the Alabarnaatrocities, one has
aimassive effort at nulliﬁcation, and
as these lines are written the Gov—
ernors of Arkansas and Mississippi
have expressed their support.

This is a New Secession, but com-
ing a century after the Old Treason,

_ its methods differ. This is secession,
 without leaving the Union; fit is an
 Qeffort to nullify the laws of the land,
‘ "to" continue the racist _o~p-pression

against which those‘ laws were di-
rected, and yet to remain part of the
Nation. This is not a “breakdown
of law and order”; this is a defiance
of Federal law carried out by the
highest authorities of _ States, who
openly connive at and justify massive

lynch law. All the .evi_dE:1,1c_-ea. shows -A

that the engineers‘ of -th_is..;cjc_>'1,1r1'tei1'.—
revolutionary movement—seeking to

undo our nation’s Second Revolu-

tion—as members and supporters of

the Ku Klux Klan, the White Citi-
zens’ Councils and the Iohn Birch
Society, are actual conspirators in ex-
actly the same way as the Old Se-
cessionists, with their Knights of the
Golden Circle, and their White Ca-
melia Societies, maliciously plotted
the destruction of the Republic and
the expansion of human slavery.

To compromise with these con-
spirators, to try to placate and appease
them is wrong and fruitless. It was
tried with their ideological ancestors
a century ago and did nothing but
make the ﬁnal effort to thwart them
that much more diﬂicult and costly.
Let them go in peace, it was urged;
give them more land, for their hell-

«born “peculiar” institution; let us
Hgutarantee forever their undisturbed

possession of human flesh. The ap-
peasement failed then because short
of abject surrender there was no ap-
peasing the monster, and because the
health of the nation, the will of mil-
lions’ of democratic-minded white
people, the opinion of the world, and
thedeterminatio-n of the Negro peo-
ple‘ to endure slavery no more, ﬁnally
forced a stand, hurled back the treas-
onous attack, saved the nation and
eliminated chattel slavery.

  

It is not co-mpromise with evil that
is needed, b-ut positive action against
evil; it is not the appeasement of ra-
cism that is needed, but its extirpa-
tion. And this is not an “impractical”
idea; appeasement and compromise
are the impractical ideas, simply be-
cause—if the object really is social
progress and democratic adz/ance-
they do no-t work. Ap-p-easing and
compromising result in strengthen-
ing the evil and disheartening and
weakening its foes. Early in the
Civil War, the policy of “modera-
tion” and compromise, carried over
from the preceding years, was tried;
conduct the war so as not to “offend”
the traitors, was the idea. But with-
out destroying the traitors there could
be no peace and no country; to de-
stroy them it was necessary to wage
a principled contest and that meant
a contest in which the deepest Ne-
gro-white alliance was forged and in
which the stated and promised goal
was Negro liberation.

You “could not do it”; it was “un-
thinkable”; the white people would
never “stand for it”——these were the
alarms raised by the “practical” ones
who——somehow——always manage to
ally themselves with reaction, albeit
they often say, with a heavy heart.
What, it was asked: Recognize Haiti
and have Negro Ministers in Wash-
ington? Hang a captured slave-trad-
er? Make soldiers of Negroes? Give
Negro soldiers equal pay with
whites? Have Negro soldiers,

armed, and ﬁghting side by side with

white soldiers, against white men?
Each, it was solemnly afﬁrmed, was
absolutely impossible; to attempt each
was madness and could only result
in disaster. But Haiti was recognized
and the capitol didn’t fall down; the
slave-trader was hanged, publicly,
in New York City, and the Republic
didn’t collapse; Negroes were en-
listed in the Army, and the only
complaint that persisted was that
there were not enough of them; Ne-
gro soldiers did ﬁght with white sol-
diers againstConfederate troops and
they fought very well and without
them, said Abraham Lincoln and
Ulysses S. Grant, it was diﬂicult to
see how the Civil War would have
ended with Union victory. The “prac-
tical” conservatives were, in fact,
abettors of traitors; the “imp-ractical"’
radicals were, in fact, decisive con-
trib-uto-rs to victory.

All experience not only shows that
policies of “moderation” and “gradu-
alism” and “patience” and appease-
ment do not work; all experience
shows that when such policies were
decisively rejected, and clear, vigor-
ous policies were adopted without
equivocation against racist practices,
those practices were overcome. There
is not only the whole experience of
the Civil War period to attest to
this; there is also the recent experi-
ences of World War II. What, it
was asked, incredulously, do you ex-
pect to train Negro and white men
together, in the same camps, in the
same tents, in the same class-rooms-,

 

 

 

so that they could become compe-
tent oﬂicers in infantry and ﬁeld ar-
tillery and engineering outﬁts——and
do you expect to do this in Okla-
homa, in Virginia, in Georgia? “Im-
possible.” It wasn’t impossible; not
when the Government saw that it
needed this program, and said that it
wanted it, and seriously ztndertook to
carry it out. There was some fric-
tion; there were some incidents;
there was some difficulty. But it
was far from “impossible”; it was
done and done quickly—not “moder-
ately”—and done completely. It
Worked with tens of thousands of
men, of all colors and from every
region of the country.

In the winter of 1944-45, the Ger-
mans ‘broke through in Belgium and
were advancing towards Antwerp.
Reinforcements were desperately
needed; a likely source, at hand, were
Negro service troops. Would those
men undergo intensive combat train-
ing and then be willing to go into
the front-lines? They were asked and
tens of thousands of them said “yes”;
then, the question arose: would the
white men ﬁght alongside the Ne-

_gro soldiers? They were asked and

almost unanimously they said, “no,
never.” But the reinforcements were
needed; and the United States gov-
ernment directed that the Negro men
be trained for combat and that after
such training they be sent in as rein-
forcements. This was done, and be-
fore the Negro men were assigned
to their front-line outﬁts, the white

oﬂicers and men were told—clearly,
and without any room for doubt-
that if there were refusal to ﬁght
with the reinforcements, those who
refused would be tried by general
court-martial for desertion, in the face
of the enemy—carrying the death
penalty. Well, the men and officers
who had said, almost unanimously,
that the program was impossible
and they themselves would not ﬁght,
did ﬁght and the program was so far
from impossible that it saved the day
in Belgium, and a very cold series of
days it was too. Then after the ﬁght-
ing and when it came time to go
home, the white men were asked
whether they wanted to return as
they had come (i.e., as lily-White out-
ﬁts) or did they want to go home
the way they had fought (i.e., as
“mixed” outﬁts). The same men who
had vo-ted almost 100% against hav-
ing Negro soldiers ﬁght with them,
now voted almost 100% that they
wanted to remain “mixed” and
wanted to go home the way they
had fought.

The idea of “impracticality is es-
pecially ridiculous in the present era
when the people of Nigeria have
zachieved independence and those of
Kenya are on the verge of victory.
One wonders whether U.S. ruling-
:lass “patience” (for the other fellow)
is to hold good until all Africa is free.
Is the Negro citizen of the United
States to get a democratic cup of
coffee or a digniﬁed ride on a bus
Jnly after every other human being

93

elsewhere in the world has achieved
such elementary “rights”? Is this the
vaunted leadership and pioneering
and “new frontiering” of our coun-
try?

The devastating impact of the Ala-
bama atrocity upon the U.S. diplo-
matic posture has been widely noted;
it has been held to be as disastrous
as the Cuban ﬁasco. The N ew York
Times warns that Alabama casts
doub-t upon U.S. foreign policy in-
sofar as that policy is alleged to be
in favor of freedom, equality and
democracy. How the record of
American foreign policy for the past
ﬁfteen years could lead anyone-
even a New York Times editor—-
to think that these are this country’s
foreign-policy aims is most difficult to
understand. Probably, the editorial
writer meant to convey the idea. that
it makes demagogic babbling about
that foreign policy all the more.trans-
parent. ‘i

The U.S. government and its At-
torney—General, in denouncing Ala-
bama’s disregard for law,wcertainly
are in a difficult position, since, as
132 distinguished lawyers recently
joined in pointing out, the -United
States violated half a ‘dozen. federal
laws and half a dozen ‘international
commitments in directing the coun-
ter—revo-lutionary thrust against Cuba.
Indeed, of that thrust, Mr. Arthur
Larson, formerly director of the U.S.
Information Agency, and currently
with the Law School at Duke Uni-
versity, said: “It is the worst setback

to law in our international relations
in this century” (N. Y. Times, May
22). .
It is clear, then, that this Alabama
crime, and the whole reality of U.S.
racism, stands as a shattering indict-
ment of U.S. diplomatic pretensions.
The pretensions and the racism are
inter—related; the struggle against
them is inter-related, too. Certainly,
world-wide inﬂuence is decisively and
p-a.ssionately behind the ﬁghters for
Negro liberation ; possibly such con-
siderations evoke certain signs of
caution, if not sanity, from a South-
ern Senator like Sam I. Ervin, ]r., of
North Carolina. Such considerations,
also, make all the more urgent and
realistic a forthright policy directed
against KKK -barbarism.

It is not that the enforcement of
the federal laws against discrimina-
tion and segregation is “impractical_’_’;
it is that the will for such enforce-
ment and the action to carry out
that will have been missing.

Most of the press of the country,
including the New York Times,
which strongly condemns the rioters
and their oﬂicial instigators, adopts
a position» condemnatory of “both
sides” in these outbreaks—the racists
and the liberationists. The latter are
condemned as “trouble—makers,” as
“provocative” and “impatient.” .Any
position which tends to. equate the
gangsters with their victims is mon-
strous. Inequality has existed for
three hundred years, and the Civil
War was fought a century ago, and

 

 

the 14th Amendment was p-assed in
1866; how long is one,_,to -wait -be-
fore he qualiﬁes as “patient”-._? _And
for whom is one to wait—for_Pat_ter-e
son of Alabama, and Barnett. of Mis-
sissippi and Faubus of Alikansas and
Eastland of Mississippi ancl,McLellan
 Alabama and the other :Honorable
Ones, whose eyes are ropes, whose
limbs are faggots, whose hearts are
dollars, and whose blood exudes ra-
cist poison? What these worthies
need is impeachment and indictment,
not moderation and appeasement. »

When laws prohibiting discrime

inatory behavior and practices are»

passed, racists shout that segregation.
is a matter of “customs,” and. that
laws can have and do have no im—'
pact upon such “customs”; on the
other hand, these same racists are
very careful to bulwark their vicioys
‘écus,toms” with an elaborate framee
WOIk;g_D£ laws. If laws are irrelevant.
inmopp-osition to jim crow, why are
laws. required for the maz'72tena'nce
of jim crow? The answer is that laws
are not irrelevant at all, and that jim
crow. is not natural but is artiﬁcial.
Jim crow is man—made;, it is class-
made, to be exact, an.dg,,the. ruling
class which has proﬁted from the op».
pression of the Negro people, knows
that laws have been required to bring
about and tohelp sustain the foul
racist systern  . 

Forsthis reason; laws are needed .to
abolish jim crow; and not only are
such laws needed,:but their enforce-
ment-. is ;req_uired.= Furthermore, in

the specific case of the Freedom
Riders,_:_theygare seeking to test how
well the-. law-..o'f the land is being en-
forced; they -are no-t violating any
laws, neither federal nor state, be-
cause all segregatory laws, as ap-
plied to interstate travel, have been
declared unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court in several decisions,
going back at least twenty years.
They are, therefore, null and void.
This is why, when the Southern racist
authorities arrest the staunch Negro
and white Riders, they charge them
not with violating laws dealing with
matters of race, but rather hold them
on the clearly fake charge of “breach
of the peace.” Already, in Mississippi
alone, eighty—one Negro and white
citizens——fro_m the North and from
the South——have been arrested and
goinvicted for .“breach of the peace,”
and‘ the latest sentences have been
quite‘____savag_e, involving not only a
fine but also four months

than ever”? Such “statesmen” are as
lost to humanit as Eichmann in his
Y. .
glass cage; waiting for them Wlll
bring us such a harvest as the latter
statesman gathered.

It is the real practicality of smash-
ing jim crow in our own day that
has led the KKK traitors to des-
perate expedients of massive deﬁance
of law and open resort to terror.
This real practicality ﬂows not only
from the entire international situa-
tion; it ﬂows also from the height-
ened militancy of the Negro people,
who have deliberately and manifest-
ly decided that they will not live
with racism any more, no matter
what the cost. It ﬂows, too, from the
fact that increasing millions of Am-
erican white people—especially young
people—are sick and tired and
thoroughly ashamed of the jim crow-
barbarism.

Is it not remarkable how the
“trouble-makers” never are the ra-
cists, the exploiters, the mobsters?
Those who hold slaves do not make
“trouble”; only those who would end
slaveholding are “trouble-makers.”
Those who possess colonies are never
“trouble-makers”; only those who
would end colonialism are “trouble-
makers.” Those who fatten on pov-
erty, who maintain illiteracy, who
encourage wars are never “trouble-
makers;” only those who would end
poverty,, eliminate illiteracy, and for-
ever prevent wars are the “trouble
makers.” “Shall the millions for ever
submit to robbery,” asked Frederick

Douglass in 1856, “to murder, to
ignorance, and every unnamed evil
which an irresponsible tyranny can
devise . . ."?

How many lessons does President
Kennedy need in the futility of
“moderation” and “compromise?”
Did he not accept the endorsement
of the Ku Kluxer, Governor Patter-
son? Did he not appoint Patter-
son's crony and fellow Ku Kluxer,
Charles M. Meriwether as a Director
of the Export-Import Bank (to help
“reform” Latin Americal)? Did he
not drop.in on Senator Byrd’s birth-
day party, though the Senator had
sent him only a printed invitation?
Did he not accept Lyndon Johnson,
and has he not pushed Johnson to the
fore? Has he not reneged on his
“firm” campaign promise about civil-
rights legislation, and has he not
failed to introduce such legislation?
And did not the Alabama culmina-
tion of the Ku Klux Klan conspiracy
against the United States govern-
ment occur after all these manifesta-
tions of “moderation” were made?
Did not, then, Alabama Governor
Patterson show true Southern “cour-
tesy” by refusing to accept a tele-
phone call from the President of the
United States?

The President has not shown “sol-
emnity and steadfastness” in meet-
ing this challenge, despite the N. Y.
Post’: editorial opinion (May 22).
On the contrary, he himself has not
said one word publicly, and an-
nounced, on May 23, that he had can-

 

 

celled all press conferences prior to
his trip abroad. Marshals were sent——
seven days after violence had broken
out in Anniston—but these were
handpicked «fromthe Southern states
—the largest batch were guards from
Atlanta Penitentiary. No wonder
that, though not unacquainted with
the use of tear gas, they showed them-
selves so clumsy in using it'in Mont-
gomery that they distressed the
threatened Negro men and women
very much more than the besieging
mob. No wonder that an automobile
——_belonging to the niece of Sir Win-
ston Churchill!—could be bombed
and consumed by ﬂames, though it
was within one block of the as-
sembled marshals, and no wonder
that no one was apprehended for
this piece of jollity.

Steadfastness in this crisis requires
more than phone calls——especially un-
completed calls!—and more than the
dispatch of over-age marshals. The
President in the past has talked of
the need for moral leadership from
his oﬂice; we could use some of
that, too. But the people elected a
President, not a preacher. The Pres-
idential oﬂice is an Executive one, not

a lecturing one. The President is

endowed with more power than any
other single person in the United
States; let him use that power, and
never mind the telephone. He is
eommander—in—ehief of the armed
forces; let him use those forces. He
is chief initiator of legislation, let
him initiate needed legislation-; he is

the chief administrator of the law,
let him administer the law. These
are the duties he has sworn to per-
form; the lectures are extra-
«curricular.

The Governor of Alabama-a Ku

iKluxer—has chosen. to defy and vio-
ate United States law; in doing this
he has assumed responsibility for
dire injury to citizens. The Alabama
police force, as is an open secret, is in-
fested by Ku Kluxers. To expect this
Governor and these police to enforce
the federals laws, to pro-tect-the rights
of American citizens, to act in sup-
port of human dignity and equality
is as absurd as expecting mercy from
nazis.

The United States Army—with
fully integrated units—could and
should restore the supremacy of
United. States law in Alabama and
wherever else it is spat upon. The
full majesty of the federal govern-
ment should be on hand so long
as its will is ﬂouted, its citizens
clubbed, and the Declaration of Inde-
pendence——after all that does date
back to 1776, and so meets all “pa-
tience” requirements,——and the Con-
stitution of this country, including
the 14th and 15th amendments are
treated with contempt.

If this is done, then the democratic
processes in this country will be kept
open. If this is done, then the.means
for the achievement of peaceful
change, through constitutional ac-
tions, remain viable. What the trai-
tors to such processes desire is to
