SOURCES AND DOCUMENTATION

U.S. casualties are from the Pentagon as reported in the New York Times.

Casualties for ARVN (Saigon troops) and the VIET CONG are derived
from Pentagon estimates for 1964 and 1965 as given on page 103 of Douglas
Pike’s book V iet Cong, M.I.T. Press, 1966. The 1965 ﬁgures were reaflirmed by
General Taylor at the Senate Hearings in early 1966. Here they are:

ARVN VIET CONG
1964 1965 1964 1965
Killed in Action 7,064 11,333 16,969 36,924
Wounded 16,700 22,600 (unknown) (unknown)

General Taylor at the hearings estimated 3 wounded for each killed and
his ratio has beenfollowed.

Since the major escalation took place after 1965, casualties for 1961-63 were
conservatively estimated as 50% less than those of 1964, and casualties for 1966
and 1967 as 50% more than those of 1965. For the ﬁrst third of 1968, including
the Tet offensive, U.S. estimates are 50,000 Viet Cong killed. Most observers
thought this a gross exaggeration, hence this ﬁgure has been cut in half and the
same ﬁgure assigned to the ARVN as well.

Civilian deaths are difficult to assess but again not impossible to estimate
as to order of magnitude. The Saigon government has accepted a ﬁgure of 160,000
civilian war dead in South Vietnam for 1961-1963, an average of 53,000 dead
per year before the major escalation took place.

After 1965 the bombing multiplied enormously. In 30 months (July 15,
1965 - November 15, 1967) the U.S. dropped 1,630,500 tons of bombs on Vietnam,
more than double the amount dropped in the Korean War. This means an average
of 12 tons of bombs for every square mile of Vietnam, or 100 lbs. of explosives for
every man, woman and child in all of Vietnam. It is conservative to set the number
of 1964 deaths at the previous average of 53,000, and to double it for 1965 forward.

For North Vietnam a low ﬁgure of 50,000 dead and 150,000 wounded was
taken, making for all of Vietnam 21/; million civilian casualties, This estimate is
comparable with the known civilian casualties of the Korean War which were
two million. Since the population of Vietnam is smaller than Korea (35 million
vs 41 million) and the tonnage of bombs dropped more than double, the esti-

    THE TASK AHEADTT

The riots are a product of many centuries of neglect and injustice
on the part of our whole society, and are, therefore, an American
problem———a challenge to our whole society to provide moral com-
mitment and the commitment of resources that are necessary to
alleviate the causes of despair in this country.

A century after the legal emancipation of the slaves, we still have
a kind of colonial society in which 20 million Negro Americans are
trapped in a cultural and economic ghetto. Our responsibility today
is to de-colonize America, in spirit and in fact. The Negro American,
and every minority group, must be allowed full citizenship...

The fact is that American Negroes are not wholly a part of Ameri-
can society and American culture. The fact is that we, the affluent,
white society of America, have been living in a land of rhetoric and
false promises, telling Negroes that we are working to solve their
problems.

The time, as the President’s Riot Commission tells us, is short if we
are to prevent more bloodshed. I believe that this nation can stem
future riots and bloodshed ———we have the potential, we have the
intellect, and we have the will.

But we cannot solve any problems if we persist in wasting man-
power, money and moral energy in the war in Vietnam.

The cost of saving our nation will be high——and it will require
great sacrifice.

McCARTHY's PRINCIPLED POLITICS,
NOT POLICE METHODS, IS THE BEST WAY
TO RESCUE OUR YOUTH FROM ALIENATION

The emergence of Eugene McCarthy as
a genuine contender for the Presidency is
a once—in-a-lifetime political happening. He
entered the contest purely on principle to
bring the issue of Vietnam before the Amer-
ican people.

But the nation, especially some of its
younger members, proved to be more civil-
ized than the conduct of the Johnson Ad-
ministration had led most of us to suspect.
It was like drilling a water well, expecting
to pump up a few gallons a minute, and
hitting a gusher. A ﬂood might start which
would actually sweep McCarthy into the
White House.

Even if McCarthy loses, the signiﬁcance
of the showing he is sure to make is beyond
exaggeration. What he has done is to start
the conversion of the old parties into new
national groupings revolving around na-
tional values. Value issues, being essentially
moral cut right across and through all kinds
of interest groups . . . No less important,
these new constituencies tend to be national,
ignoring regions, sections, localities. So Mc-
Carthy, aware of this shift, is making an
intelligent and conscious appeal to the new
national constituencies.

from an Editorial, The Nation
April 8, I968

Many costs are beyond calculation, but the moral and human costs
suffered by American youth . . . are surely the heaviest.

[The war] threatens to alienate many in a generation of Americans
upon whom the future of this country depends.

This need not be a nation of distrust and fear; we can return to what
we have promised to be.

THE TASK AHEAD

RETORE AMERlCA’S

BECAUSE OF THESE POLICIES

This is Admiral William Raborn, ]r., (backed
by J. Edgar Hoover) , who was head of the CIA
until 1967. He is quoted as saying that Ameri- g

can policy in Vietnam is: I: ‘
"A ROTTERDAM POLICY IN THE NORTH;
A DOMINICAN POLICY IN THE SOUTH"

    

A Dominican policy means overwhelming troop
strength as in Santo Domingo. A Rotterdam
policy means the Nazi policy used in Holland
of blackmailing governments into surrender by
bombing civilians. This policy was tried out by
Goering at Cuernica in the Spanish Civil War.
Admiral Raborn’s political Freudian slip ex-
poses U.S. bombings as following the Nazi
traditions of Guernica and Rotterdam.

Senator Eugene J. McCarthy

 

       

   

 

 
   
 
 

The kind of man who cares more about principle
than his own neck.

The kind of man who tells it like it is, even when
it’s not ‘smart politics’ to do so. Like standing up
to ]oe McCarthy when no one else in Congress
would. And standing up to Lyndon ]ohnson in the
primaries when no one else would.

Gene McCarthy is the kind of egghead who

can handle a plow (he was raised on a Minnesota
dirt farm which his 92-year-old father still runs)
as well as a classroom (he taught public school
and college for 10 years, and was once the
youngest principal in Minnesota).

Gene’s the kind of scholar who can talk candidly
about theology one minute (he once studied to be
a monk) and spy stuff the next (he was a code-
busting expert for Army Intelligence during
World War II).

He’s as conversant with the ﬁne points of
unemployment compensation (he chaired the
special Senate Committee on...Unemployment) as
the subtleties of ]efterson’s philosophy. As
knowledgeable about NATO (twice a delegate to
NATO conferences) as Black Angus cattle.

And when it comes to elections,

Gene McCarthy is one heck of a vote-getter.
In 20 years in public life (10 in the House, 10 in the
Senate) he’s never lost an election.

In 1964, in fact, Gene racked up the largest
plurality of any Democrat in the history of Minnesota.

He’s the kind of vote-getter who, in March,
astonished the world by winning a whopping 42%
of the Democratic primary vote (and 20 of the

24 delegates) in hawkish New Hampshire.

Plus over 5,000 write-ins from Republicans.

Even more astonishing, Gene is the kind of man
for whom college kids cut their hair.

He’s the kind of man who inspired Shana
Alexander to write, in LIFE: “I admire the
scholarly senator for a number of things he won’t
do. He won’t oversimplify. He won’t run a rah-rah,
straw hats and balloons campaign, he won’t

orate, he won’t ripsnort and he won’t demagogue.”

He was there when we needed him . . .that’s the
kind of man Gene McCarthy is.

THE COST OF ESCALATION IN U.S. LIVES

In Johnson's administration, U.S. troops multiplied by 15 times and casualties
by twenty-two times. These are the facts and they go far to explain why
Mr. Johnson was finally forced not to run in November.

''I do not believe that the NLF . . .can be denied a role J

as a political force in the future of South Vietnam.”
Senator Eugene J. McCarthy

 

The Administration’s first tentative steps to negotia-
tions have been widely acclaimed at home and abroad.
It is, however, of the greatest importance that Americans
have a full picture of the horrors of this war, of its terrible
cost in people killed, maimed and suffering. This compre-
hension is essential for two reasons:

1—To see to it that negotiations are neither grudging
nor protracted. They must take place in full awareness of
what the United States has done in the past few years, and 9
that the burden is on us to negotiate in a spirit of compas- ‘I
sion and reconciliation. Otherwise, as in Korea, there may
be nearly as many casualties during peace talks as there
were in the previous war period.

2——The aftermath of the war, both abroad and at
home, will require the most dedicated and skillful eﬁorts
to bind our nation’s wounds as well as those of our enemy,
and to restore America’s true self in the eyes of the world.
The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King is a sombre
warning of how this nation can be torn asunder. Recon-
ciliation, on the basis of meeting long-neglected needs, is
the only hope for the future at home and abroad.

The following pages, therefore, fall into two main sec-
tions. The first is to present the nature and cost of the war;
 the second is to present the task ahead and some of the

, major policies required. It is the belief of many Americans

‘ that Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, by virtue of his experi-
ence and integrity on the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and his qualifications as a teacher in economics and
sociology, is the one candidate who can best deal with the
problems facing this country.

“T he ugliness of the war is matched only by its futility. The very
survival of Vietnam is at stake. IT IS TIME TO CALL A HALT.”
