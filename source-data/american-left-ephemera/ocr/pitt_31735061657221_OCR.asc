On the witness stand for 9 full days, Mrs. Oleta O'Connor Yates, one of the. 14 Smith Act defendants,
gave straight—forward testimony of her activities as a Communist Party leader, and her understanding of
what the Communist Party of the United States stands for.

In Federal Judge Mathes’ courtroom on Thursday, June 26, the government attorneys were cross-exam-
ining Mrs. Yates. As State Organizational Secretary of the Communist Party of California, Mrs. Yates
testified to her duties and activities. The government was unable to refute her past week's testimony. The
government actually has no case. It cannot prove the flimsy charges under the Smith Act indictment. It
therefore now resorts to a contemptible effort to turn the defendants into informers. It thus further re-
veals the frame-up character of the whole trial.

Mrs. Yates was ordered to answer questions about persons not in the case.

Here is Her Answer:

“I am willing to state anything you want to know about me and what I have
done and what I think and what my intent is; but I am not willing to do any-
thing that is going to harm the defense of other people and I am not willing to
do anything that is going to open up the door of persecution and harassment of

other people. However many times I am asked and in however many forms, to

identify a person as a communist, I can't bring myself to do it, because I know
it means loss of job, and l know that it means persecution for them and their
families. I know that it even opens them up to possible illegal violence, and I
will not be responsible for that. I WILL NOT DO IT.’’

lN THE COURTROOM. THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARGUED:

MR. MARGOLIS: “lThisl is an attempt to make her (Mrs. Yates) give names for the sake of getting names,

rather than really testing her under direct examination. And for a witness who is willing to
tell everything about herself, everything about her intent, who does not want to be responsible
where she, in her heart, knows that these people have not done anything wrong, it would be
really an abuse (of the power of the court to cite for contemptl.”

Four times Mrs. Yates was ordered by Judge Mathes to be an informer. Four

times she refused. Four times she was held in contempt.
She was taken into custody and is held in jail until she talks!
