emergency means of prevent-

Organizing

Goal Set by

, Local 758

CHICAGO, Ill. —— Organizing
the unorganized shops in the
Chicago area is a prime goal

’ which Chicago Amalgamated

Union No. 758 has set for it-.
self for the coming year.

The local’s annual conven-
tion April 28 set the goal in

~ an adopted resolution calling
_ on the rank and file member-

ship to assist their shop stew-
ards in planning and carrying
out the program of building

the union and expanding its.

activities.
District 3 Board member

3 Raymond Dennis reported on

new organizational drives go-

' ing on in the district, includ-

ing the campaigns in the up-
per Michigan peninsula. He
stressed the need for the local
to consolidate its position by
organizing non-union shops in
Chicago. The amalgamated
Local 758 presently holds con-

' tracts at some 13 shops in

the area.
LARSON SPEAKS

The convention was also ad-
dressed by Int’l Vice President
Orville Larson who spoke on
the problems of the labo r
movement generally- and the
conditions affecting our own

- union at the present time.

Considerable discussion was
held on two important reso-

-lutions covering civil rights
2 and political action.

The civil rights resolu-

 tion called for a fight to

enforce the Supreme Court
decision against segregation
in schools, to outlaw segre- '
gation everywhere, to guar-
antee all citizens the right
to vote, to outlaw the poll
tax, and to assure political
and economic equality for
all.
LEGISLATION

Cooperation with other la-
bor groups was urged in the
resolution on legislative and
political action. The conven-
tion pledged a ﬁght against
state and federal anti-labor
laws, for low income tax re-
duction, for repeal of the
right-to-work section in the
Taft-Hartley and T-H repeal
itself, for increased low-cost
housing construction and the
building of more schools, in-
creased state and federal work-

ers’ benefits, for peaceful re-I

lations and trade among all
countries, and greater assist-
ance for the aged and de-
pendent children.

Nominations for local elec-
tions left all officers unop-
posed except for the posi-
tion of business manager.
Incumbent James Pinta was
opposed by Jesse Glanton
of the Elesco Smelting shop.
(In the local election held
May 21 along with the In-
ternational referendum,
Pinta was again reelected
business manager.)

The Local 758 convention
also went on record support-
ing Larson for vice president
and backing all the Interna-
tional referendum a m e n d-
merits.

Tornado

The flock of tornados that
tore through parts of Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas and Mis-
souri last month also ripped
a path of destruction through
the town of Desloge in the
Missouri Lead Belt Where
Mine-Mill members live.

At least four persons were
reported dead from the twister
that hit Desloge May 21. From
nearby Bonne Terre, home of
Mine-Mill Valley Dolomite
Workers Union No. 618, pres-
ident A. C. Thomas reported
that none of our membe-rs
were physically hurt although
extensive property d a m a g e
may have been suffered. The

torel. A

El Paso Shutdown

Workers at the El Paso
AS&R smelter voted May 10
to return to work after a
week-long shutdown of the
plant. The walk-out occurred
when Local 509 shop steward
Alfredo Ayala and another
member were fired for fight-
ing, and plant management re-
fused the request of the local
membership and District 2
Board member J. B. Chavez
for an immediate top level
meeting on the discharge.

The plant resumed opera-
tion only after management

Terre was also damaged,-

agreed to a third step meet-
ing the day after the return
to work and also agreed to re-
solve the issue through arbi-
tration at the earliest possible
date. The arbitration was
scheduled for May 29.

20th Anniversary

Some 600 people in’ the
Wrigley, Tenn. community at-
tended a celebration by Good-
will Furnace Workers Union
No. 314 on April 19.marking
the twentieth aniversary of
the lQcal’s charter. It was the
first celebration of its kind in
District 5.

Each of the 140 charter
members were awarded a
Mine-Mill union lapel pin. A
hundred and thirty charter
members were present; 53
are now deceased. The
awards were presented by
Int’l Rep. M. 0. “Dick” An-
derson who assisted in the
original organization of L0-
cal 314. Board member Al-
ton Lawrence and Int’l Rep.
Charles Wilson spoke to the
guests who were treated ‘by
the local to a fish dinner and
a showing of the movie
“Salt of the Earth.”

The celebration was planned
by the Union Defense commit-
tee, headed by Alvin Dotson,
along with the Recreation
committee, headed by Ellis
Toy, and assisted by ladies of
the community. A raffle was
also held to raise funds for
union defense.

The loc‘al’s anniversary
date has been established as-
a. seventh paid holiday under
the contract and‘ the mem-
bership plans to make simi-
lar celebrations an annual
affair.

Public Service

A special effort to alert dis-
abled workers to benefits they
are entitled to under new pro-
visions of the Social Security
law has been made by Coeur
d’Alene District Union No. 18.
The local ran a special public
service advertisement in the
North Idaho Press warnin g
that June 30 is the deadline
for filing disability pension

applications, and’ announcing
that the district Social Secur-
ity agent would be available

at the Kellogg City Hall on the

nesday as well as at the Wal-
lace Post Office building in the
afternoon of the same day.

Boncl Drive

Mine-Mill Utah locals joined
with other unions and the
Kennecott Copper Company's
Utah Division in sponsoring a
drive to encourage the pur-
chase of U. S. Savings Bonds
through payroll deductions.
The drive began May 22 ‘and
continued through May 31.

Political Action

A meeting of the Montana
Democratic Labor Activities
Committe in Helena May 13
blasted Governor J. Hugo
Aronson and Republican
members of the State Leg-
islature for repudiating
pledges to enact an indus-
trial disease law. Mine-Mill
District 1 Board member Er-
nest Salvas is chairman "of
the committee for the state's
western congressional dis-
trict. Democratic State
Chairman Lief Erickson also
attended the meeting.

, Salvas reports that the meet-
ing discussed expanding and
strengthening the committee
in both congressional districts,
continuing activity by com-
mittee members including vot-
er registration, support for a
Hell’s Canyon authorization
bill in Congress, informing la-
bor organizations of legisla-
tors’ voting records, and gen-

erally maintaining political ac-—

tivity for the coming months.

truded Metals.
CO-ORDINATION

Greater coordination among
~ Anaconda company locals was
planned in the handling of
grievances, processing of arbi-
tration cases, and preparation
for negotiations in 1959. As
one means of effecting greater

1 coordination, the conference

voted to issue a quarterly bul-
letin to all locals which will
include articles on conditions
‘ in the-mines and plants, griev-
ances, new production meth-
ods, industry conditions, and
1 other -news of common inter-
1 est to Anaconda employees.
Plans were made to ex-
pand the membership of the
conference with the affilia-
tion of all local unions hold-
, ing agreements with the
-Anaconda company, regard-
less of International union
affiliation.
 b The conference Voted to
1 ’ ‘share the expense of Mine-

' ‘ Mill’s‘ precedent-making Buf-
. falo arbitration case in which
-_ the arbitrator had ruled that
the company could not dis-
_ charge employees 68 years old

who were not eligible for pen-
.._- ‘ sions. Application of the rul-
,' j ing to other operations was
’ . agreed upon.

treasurer.

_,One of the major discus-
sions at the conference re-
volved around the current
copper-brass industry out-
look, based on a report by
 Mine-Mill Research Director

 Bernard Stern. Action was
gwithheld pending the release
”of_ the Department of In-

   

 

   
    
     

terioi-’s long-range minerals
program.

Don't Buy

Coors Beer

TO ALL WESTERN LOCALS:

Dear Brothers: The Coors
Brewery of Golden, Colorado,
has opened up an all-out cam-
paign to smash the Brewery
Workers Union which has been
on strike since April 24.

The enclosed letter from the
officers of their International
Union explains the issues. In
a letter to our Union, Interna-
tional President Karl F. Feller
writes:

“I am certain that you full
well realize the importance of
our winning this strike, and we
appreciate your wholehearted
cooperation and support.”

The latest development in
the strike is an attempt by
Coors to use students from the
Colorado School of Mines as
strike breakers. If this at-
tempt succeeds, it can well be
a pattern for union bus_ting
throughout the Rocky Moun-
tain West.

On the other hand, if all un-
ion members in the Western
states support the strike by re-
fusing to buy Coors beer, the
strike can be won.

We urge you to bring this to
the attention of all members
and to do everything in your
power to support the strikers
by cutting off the sale of
Coors beer.

NEW HALL

The date and place of the
conference was planned by
the District 5 delegates at the
St. Paul convention so as to
coincide with the dedication
here of the new union hall
built by Fertilizer & Chemical
Workers Local 863.

The International officers
will speak at the confer-
ence’s opening session Sat-
urday night, giving the dele-
gates up to date reports on
activities throughout the
union, application of the In-
ternational’s program in the
South and other matters af-
fecting the welfare of the
membership.

HEALTH PROGRAM

Sunday’s session will be de-
voted to reports from each lo-
cal on their current activities
and problems. Special em-
phasis will be given to discus-
sion of progress being made
by the locals in carrying out
then? program on health and
welfare activity outlined at
the recent convention. Mate-
rial will be made available and
plans set for the newly estab-
lished health, welfare and in-
surance commiteemen in the
various locals to help them
carry out their duties.

Formal ceremonies dedicat-
ing the new Local 863 hall will
be held Sunday afternoon, fol-
lowing which there will be a
dinner for the conference dele-
gates and visitors as well as
members of the Charleston
local.

SURVIVED IN DESERT

The desert west of Great
Salt Lake once supported
10,000 Indians. The aborigines
had no agriculture, irrigation,
cattle or advanced tools, but
they managed to survive
chiefly on wild seeds, roots,
and nuts, the National Geo-
graphic Society says.

Push Pad-
Talks at

S. Manuel

SAN MANUEL, AriZ.——La-St-‘ 

ditch negotiations, backed by a

98 percent strike vote,‘ were _

being pushed by San Manuel__
Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers ;_=
Union No. 937 to reach agree- ._

ment with San Manuel Copper

Corp. on a new and first_con- ‘

tract.

After some 15 weeks ‘_ of;

’ses~ .:
sions, in which several AFL-I
C10 craft unions atthe prop- 
erty have been participating "
jointly with Mine-Mill, the lo- 

cal membership meeting May '_’
28 voted to start setting up

drawn-out negotiations

strike machinery in prepara-
tion for shutting down the _:big

mine, mill and smelter unless’.-.' 
the company got off the dime. 

NO HOLIDAY
Negotiations were continu-

ing during the final week of , ,1 
May, including sessions sched- " ' -

uled right through Memorial
Day, with the union making
every effort to reach an ami-
cable settlement.

While tentative agreement
had been reached on most
non-economic matters, sever-
al major issues still re-
mained in dispute, including
contract bonus, health and

welfare, paid holidays ‘and 

townsite rents.

Regional Director Jack C. 1
Marcotti, heading up negotia- -

tions for the International
Union, was joined by Int’l Vice
President Orville Larson at
the bargaining table during

the last week. William Hallor-i 9' if
an of the Federal Mediation 9

and Conciliation Service was
also participating.

The Boilermakers and Team-.
sters locals at the property‘

had already gone on record in
support of Mine-Mill action.

Members of the Brotherhood 9 1 it

of Locomotive Firemen and
Enginemen, who operate -the
San Manuel Railroad, had
asked authority from their—In-
ternational president to “with-

draw their men from the serv-p  
ice of the company.” 2

Local 937 president William
“Nick” Key has pointed. out
that the union is not asking
for anything that is unreason-
able from the company. Fi-
nancial secretary and negotia-
ting committee member Aaron
Lee added that after all this
time the workers were getting
disgusted with the company’s
attitude on negotiations. ~

DRIVEL

If the rest of the govern-
ment’s case is made up of the
same kind of drivel as has
been produced up to now, it is
almost impossible to see how
the charges can be upheld.

A recent witness, for in-
stance, was Elwood “Red”
Hain who testified that he
was discharged as a Mine-
Mill organizer because he
didn’t vote for Henry Wallace
in 1948 (as if anybody fol-
lowed him into the votin g
booth to see how he voted).
Cross-examination by Mine-
Mill General Counsel Nathan
Witt brought out the fact
that Hain was fired in June
of 1949 because, against the
union’s policy, he signed a $2

a_ day wage-cut sliding scale

 

Recessed Until June 11th

contract for workers in the
Tri-State area.
STRIKE STORY

Edward “Ted” Bush, former
full-time secretary of Local 18
in the Couer d’Alenes district
of Idaho, who left the union in
1951, was another recent wit-
ness. Bush was exposed as
one of three men who met
with companies in the Kellogg
area behind closed doors dur-
ing the 1949 strike, without
the knowledge of the rest of
the negotiating committee. A
sub-standard settlement was
presented to the membership
in “signed,. sealed and de-
livered” form which attracted
considerable criticism and at-
tack. Bush admitted some
members called it a “sellout.”

Ironically, it was another
recent witness against Mine- _
Mill, E. R. Everingham, who . ’

, helped lead the fight against

the Bush settlement. At the
time, Everingham was secre-

tary of former Local 14 in
Wallace, Idaho.

Haines and Bush were two
typical witnesses who tried to
cover their own questionable
records by accusing Mine-Mill
of “communism.”

Following completion of the
government’s case in mid-July
it is expected that the hearing
will again recess before the
union starts presenting its
case. How long that recess

will be is not now known, but

SACB Hearing Officer Cherry
has already announced that
there will be no hearings in
August. ~
According to this schedule,
therefore, it will be at least

, until after -Labor Day before

THE MINE-MILL UNION

JUNE. 

Has Plenty
Of Trouble

PITTSBURGH, Pa. — The
once cocky David J. McDonald,
Steelworkers union president,
is not so cocky anymore. He's
got troubles, plenty of
troubles.

McDonald’s troubles began
last year with a rank and file
revolt over the dictatorial con-

. trol of the Steelworkers con-

vention which jammed through
an increase in dues of $2 to $5
a month and a raise in McDon-

I ald’s salary from $40,000 to

$50,000 a year—-both without
a vote of the membership.

The troubles mushroornerl
when Donald Rarick, a rank
and file steel worker from Mc-
Keesport, Pa. opposed McDon-
ald for re-election as president,
the first time in the history of
the Steelworkers union that
the position had ever been con-
tested.

McDonald got the shock of
his life when Rarick, in the
election last February, rolled
up 35 per cent 01‘ the total
vote cast.

“AMAZING”

Commenting on the election,
Work, a Catholic labor paper,
said “Rarick’s showing was
nothing short of amazing.”
The New York Times said the
election “provided a jolt for
the high command of the
United Steelworkers of Amer-
1ca.”

“The magnitude of the anti-
administration vote stunned
union leaders,” reported the
Times, adding that “before
the balloting for the $50,000-
a-year presidency, Mr. Mc-
Donald’s aides had predicted

. that he would poll 85 to 90

per cent of the total vote.”
“The official union news-

‘paper in its pre-election edi-
tion was filled with pictures
.of Mr. McDonald,” but “the

names of Mr. Rarick and his
slate did not appear in the

-paper,” the New York Times
- said.

Since then, McDonald, who
in to attack Dave

ate rackets committee investi-
gation, has himself become a
target of the same committee.

‘Labor’s Daily reported May 7

that “the Senate rackets in-
vestigating committee has be-
gun a ‘preliminary investiga-
tion’ of charges that United
Steelworkers President David
McDonald is guilty of misus-
ing union funds in connection
with his recent re-election."
“ELEGANT”

Murray Kempton, labor re-
porter for the New York Post,
referring to McDonald as “an

V elegant, self-indulgent $50,000-

a-year man who tenanted a
$122-a-day suite at the Ameri-
cana Hotel in Miami during
the last session of the AFL-
CIO council," disclosed that
the Steelworkers president
was accompanied in Miami by
a Pittsburgh detective acting
as McDonald’s body guard
from a $50-a-day suite next to
McDonald’s.
Both the New York Post
and the New York Times
ported that While he was
in Miami McDonald also
spent considerable time to-
gether with a shady char-
acter named Philip Weiss,
businessman-about-town, con-
victed last October as a re-
ceiver of stolen goods. A
month later, while out on
bail, Weiss attended a ban-
quet in honor of McDonald
and sat at a table with Mc-
Donald’s wife.

“And, a month after that,”
says the Post, “Phil Weiss, ac-
cording to testimony in the
hands of Senate investigators,

. was in Pittsburgh observing

with a friend’s concern the
progress of McDonald’s cam-
paign for re-election as presi-

dent of the steel union.”

President's Corner

Clark Says Democracy Distinguishes
Mine-Mill from Some Other Unions

ANOTHER Mine-Mill referendum has been
held. This may appear to be a very simple
fact, hardly worth mentioning. To Mine-Mill
members, it is a simple fact of union life. To
millions of union members belonging to other
organizations, however, a rank-and-file, secret
ballot election and con-
stitutional referendum is
unknown.

Sometimes I think we
take our Mine-Mill de-
mocracy too much for

granted. It’s there,
around us all the time,
and often we forget the
bitter struggles of our
early days th at were
necessary to keep our
union democratic and in
the control of the membership.

Mine-Mill’s democratic constitution and its
rank-and-file traditions spell out the difference
between ours and many other unions. Because
every -Mine-Mill member knows his union is
controlled by the rank-and-file, and no one else,
the charges about “communist-domination” and
“orders from Moscow” fall flat.

 

IT’S BECAUSE Mine-Mill’s membership has
refused to be dominated by anyone, including
communists, employers, or racketeers, that our
union often is attacked. I think of many local
union leaders around this organization——in
Montana, Utah, Connecticut, the Southwest, the
Deep South, and elsewhere—-—and I ask my-
self: “How can foolish people say these men
are dominated by anyone?” It certainly is the
grossest of insults to infer that they could be
forced to jump through any man's hoop save
their own.

Consider the referendum. First, the local
union elects its delegates to the convention.

(Note—they are elected, not appointed as in

some unions.) Then they go to the conven-

VICE-PRESIDENT

tion. The convention, undominated by pay-
rollers and machine men unlike Steel and
other outfits, writes the program and policies.

At the convention, candidates for interna-
tional union office are nominated. (Note—they
are nominated there, not elected.) A man may
even nominate himself. Then, to insure an
honest election, uncontrolled by any union
leader, a rank-and-file canvassing committee is
elected.

ALSO NOTE, please,- that while the over-
whelming sentiment of the convention dele-
gates this year was for a per capita increase,
such an increase could not be put into effect.
Like all amendments to the constitution, it had
to wait for the approval of the rank-and-file
membership’ as a whole.

And how is the ruling of the rank-and-file
obtained? Not by union meetings as in some
unions, but by a referendum vote. A referen-
dum vote in Mine-Mill is a union-wide election
that takes place on the same day in every
local union. The ballot is secret and the elec-
tion judges in each local union are elected by
that loca1’s own membership.

The judges count the ballots and all of the
election material is then mailed, with proper
safeguards, to the canvassing committee. This
committee convenes in Denver and checks the
whole result. Only after the committee is satis-
fied that everything is in order are the win-
ning candidates and amendments certified.

JUST REVIEW that whole procedure again.
And then you’ll understand how no man or
group of men can “control” the union, its
policies, its finances, or its elections. Thats
why the critics of Mine-Mill resort to such in-
sane charges as “communism” when they
want to attack us. They can’t accuse us of the
sins which other unions have committed. They
can’t charge us with being anything but demo-
cratic. *

And that’s a “sin” I hope we commit for a
long, long time.—JOHN CLARK.

Home Bombecl, Asbury Howard Says
Negro Rights Fight Will Continue

"Righfeousness exo/fs a nation but sin is a
reproach to any people."

THE BRAVE men who hide behind bed sheets
and the cover of darkness have done it again.
On April 28, 1957, at 7:55 p.m., the Allen Tem-
ple AME church in Bessemer, Ala., was bombed.
At 8:03 p.m., the same
night, my home was
bombed. The two places
are about a mile apart.

The meeting at the
church was sponsored by
the Alabama Association
for the Advancement of
Human Rights. The pres-
ident of this organization
is William Thomas, pres-
ident of Harbison-Walk-
er Local 531. The main
feature of the occasion
was to be a sermon by a
12-year-old boy.

In spite of an attempt to throw a bomb
through the window of the church and the ex-
citement of the explosion on the ground, the
program continued. People were drawn from
all parts of the city.‘ All parking space was
taken for several blocks. The city policemen
made several arrests including Brother Jesse
Gaines, Vice President of Local 109, for block-
ing alleys.

To date there have been twenty-three bomb-
ings and burnings of Negro homes in the Bes-
semer-Birmingham area. The cities are twelve
miles apart. No arrests have been made for
any of these acts.

According to the brave men, every Negro
in the South who fights for human rights
must be killed; but God says, “No.” Southern
politicians are having legal ulcers trying to
prevent the Negro from voting and trying to
protect segregation. They are the silly men
of a civilized age. .

According to the Birmingham News, State
Senator Engelhart says he will probably intro-
duct :1 bill in the legislature to abolish the
county of Macon to keep Negroes from getting
political control. Mr. Engelhart’s county is the
site of Tuskegee institute. He is the president
of the White Citizens’ council. The board of
registrars in that county until last week had

not met in many months. They met last week 

 

in an entirely bare room. They used as an ex-
cuse that they could not perform their duties
of registering applicants because of the fact
that there were no facilities in the room. This
is done to discourage Negroes in their struggle
for freedom.

The Negroes of the South are willing to
continue the struggle.

As Vice-President of Mine-Mill and as presi-
dent of the Bessemer Voters league, I, along
with all other leaders, am willing to continue
the struggle because we feelthat our fight is
a fight for all the people.

To mention a few who have been victims of
terror for trying to get Negroes registered to
vote, let us look at the record. On May 7, 1955,
in Belzoni, Miss., the left side of the Rev. G. W.
Lee was blown away by a shotgun blast be-
cause he was a leader in getting Negroes reg-
istered to vote. To this date, no one has been
indicted for the murder of Rev. Lee.

On August 13 Lamar Smith was shot down
in broad daylight on the courthouse lawn in
Brookhaven, Miss. He also was a leader in
the vote registration campaign among Ne-
groes. Although twenty or more witnessed
the shooting, not one would say what he
saw and the grand jury failed to return an
indictment. Neither has anyone been brought ‘
to trial for the near fatal shooting of Gus
Coates, 65 year old Negro storekeeper and
leader, together with the Rev. Mr. Lee, of
the right to vote movement.

As for me, I should like to say that if it is
deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life
for the furtherance of the end of justice and
mingle my blood with the blood of the Rev. Mr.
Lee, Lamar Smith, and of many, many more
leaders of the South whose rights are disre-
garded by the wicked, cruel and unjust Klu-
Kluxers and White Citizens’ councils, I say let
it be done.

As Frederick Douglass once said, “If there
is no struggle, there is no progress. Those
who profess to favor freedom, and yet de-
preciate agitation, are men who want crops
without plowing up the ground. They want
rain without thunder and lightning. They
want the ocean without the awful roar of its
many waters. This struggle may be both
moral and physical; but it must be a strug-
gle. Power concedes nothing without a de-
mand. It never did, andit never will.” i ., , »

helped make the South what

it is today in the way of .

progress.” Declaring “we
love freedom just as much -
as any race that has ever

brought before the bar of
Justice and punished.”

A letter from Carquinez Lo-

THE MINE-MILL UNION

  

 

— DENVER — To most
_..Mine-Mill members the is-
‘ _-sue of the shorter work
, week without loss of pay
,j;,is nothing new. Mine-Mill
 conventions have been pass-
Wfing resolutions on it for the
1?  past" several years.
 .;This_year’s convention at St.
4, Paul was no different in that
‘ respect. In addition to reaf-
‘: firming the shorter work week
, demand for future negotia-
" tions, however, the delegates
 called for initiating joint ac-
tion with other unions in a
' -national campaign for federal
» legislation to reduce the pres-
ent straight-time work week
and provide overtime pay for
‘ all work above the new maxi-
. mums which would be estab-
lished. —
' ' NATIONAL ISSUE
. w What is new about Mine-
' . Mill’s often-repeated shorter
work week position is the
fact that this same demand
has now become a national
issue and a top subject of dis-
*  cussion and action throughout
the labor movement.
The shorter work week,
as Mine-Mill sees it, would
' '  ‘mean less straight - time
hours per day and less days
a per week at the same, or
.higher, take-home pay as
now. It would also mean
receiving overtime pay after
. six hours a day or thirty
,3 7 hours a week instead of
I — after the present eight and
_ _.forty. ,
 7A variation of-this demand
-» came out of the April conven-

What Do
You Think?

The press and education
program adopted by the St.
Paul convention included a
proposal that letters on
timely subjects be solicited
from the membership for
publication in the Mine-Mill
Union. One such timely sub-
ject is the shorter work
week which becomes more
important each day as weak
spots appear in the national
economy and the threat of
layoffs grows in almost ev-
ery industry, including our
own.

You can hardly pick up a ’
labor journal, business mag-
azine or financial news
column these days without
running into discussion on
the shorter work week. As
the accompanying round-11p
article shows, other unions
besides Mine-Mill also have
projected the shorter work
week as a subject for future
negotiations because of. the
slackening in employment,
automation a n d increased
productivity. Many varia-
tions are being suggested as
to just how the shorter work
week should be applied,
from industry to industry
and even from plant to plant.

Perhaps the shorter work
week as such is not the only
answer. Some people think
more paid vacations would
help, others propose addi-
tional paid holidays, others
say longer week-ends, still
others call for various com-
binations of these. ‘

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

We’d like YOUR ideas on
this important subject.
Write and tell us about it.
For space reasons, please
keep your letter short . . .9
no more than 250 words. A
round-up of these letters
will be -— printed in a forth-
coming issue of the Mine-
Mill Union.

   
 

unions which also have gone
on record favoring a shorter
work week without reduction
in pay are:

Oil, Chemical & Atomic
Workers; Machinists; Textile
Workers; Rubber Workers ;
Clothing Industry Workers;
Longshoremen’s & Warehouse-
men’s union; Electrical Work-
ers; Communications Work-

orter Work W   
irring Labor Movemnt

ers; Packinghouse Workers;
Pulp, Sulphite & Paper Mill
Workers; Food & Allied Work-
ers; Bakery Wagon Drivers;
Railway Clerks; Shoe Work-
ers.
‘Mine-Mill’s call for federal
legislation on the subject is
no idle gesture. Identical
bills to establish a shorter
work week have already
been introduced in the cur-
rent sessions of the House
of Representatives and U. S.
Senate. The House bill,
H.R. 4695, is sponsored by
Rep. James Roosevelt (D.,
Cal.). The Senate bill, S.
1217, is sponsored by Sena-
tor Pat McNamara (D.,
Mich.

These companion bills would
amend the Wage and ‘Hour
law by reducing the present
standard 40-hour work week
and establishing time and a
half pay for work done in
excess of 371/; hours two years
after passage of the bill and
in excess of 35 hours four
years after passage of the bill.

8-HOUR STRUGGLE

The Wage and Hour law,
passed in 1938 as part of
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New
Deal, established‘ the 40-hour
week as the national standard
in industry. It climaxed al-
most a century of struggle by
labor for a national 8-hour
day, a struggle in which Mine-
Mill pioneeered as the first
union to win an 8-hour day in
the western states.

In a joint statement on their
bills, Representative Roosevelt
and Senator McNamara noted
that there have been no
changes in the Wage and Hour
law for nearly 20 years despite
the tremendous increase of
productivity in industry. “The
important task,” they said, “is
that Congress undertake to
study now the problems in-
volved in adjusting the maxi-
mum work week to present
rates of productivity in indus-
try,‘ so that the Fair Labor
Standards Act (Wage and
Hour law) will continue to be
the protector of job opportu-
nities which it was designed
to be when it was passed in
1938.” 1

HISTORY

The history of the Ameri-
can labor movement has its
origin in the fight for the

Federation of Labor in 1886.
But the story goes further
back than that, to 1791 when
the journeymen carpenters in
Philadelphia struck for a
shorter day’s work with addi-

Sylvia Porter, well-known"
syndicated financial news
writer, recently predicted that
reduction of the 40-hour week
is “certain” simply on the
basis of trends that “have been
going on for the last 100
years.”

“Records show,” she said,
“that since 1850, the work
week has grown shorter
and shorter. From an aver-
age of 69.8 hours in 1850 to
64 hours in 1880 to 60.2
hours in 1900 to 49.7 hours
in 1920 to 44 hours in 1940
to 40.2 hours in 1955.”

Mine-Mill Locals Win Strike
After Brushing Off Raider

CHICAGO, I1l.—Approx-
imately 175 workers at two
plants of the Illinois Zinc
Company in Chicago and

27 ending a successful two-
.week strike. '

The workers, members
of Chicago Zinc Workers
Union No. 451 and Peru
Zinc Workers Union No. 85,
hit the bricks May 13 af-
ter prolonged negotiations
in which the company not
only had refused to make
any offer at all for a wage
increase but stubbornly in-
sisted on continuing the
same old contract without
changes for another year.

’ When intervention of the

Federal Mediation and Con-
ciliation Service still failed
togbtudge management, the
workers Walked out’.

 

The settlement ending
the strike provides for a
six cent per hour wage in-
crease retroactive to May
1, plus an extra paid holi-
day ‘(Good Friday) making
a total of seven for both
plants, and an increase in
surgical benefits.

_Int’l Rep. Jesse Van

negotiations and conduct of
the strike. The walk - out

was well organized, with
picketing carried on five
days a week and just dur-
ing the day time.

High Dam  
O.K. Urged
By Locals

Hells Canyon bill, S-555,
was scheduled for early

 

Senate debate as the Mine-

The bill would authorize the
construction of a high federal

dering Idaho and Oregon.
Favorably reported out by
the Senate Interior committee,
the bill is almost universally
supported by organized labor.
Mine-Mill was one of the
earliest supporters of the high

head dam. Last month, Mine-,

Press“ Ignores One
Stories in Nation's

’WASHINGTON, D. C.——One of the hottest
stories on Capitol Hill has been virtually ig-

nored by the nation’srcommercial press, despite
fthe fact “that it holds ‘intense interest to the
reading public -everywhere.

The cause of suppression? Those fancy ads

‘placed in newspapers by the food industry.
gFood industry is the backbone of newspaper

space sales.

The crux of the story is cancer, which
makes it of vital concern to a country where
one out of every four persons is stricken by
that killer disease. But the reason for its vir-
tual suppression is the fact that millions of

u Americans may be carrying cancer home in
, their grocery bags this week.

Since 1940 food processors have tested

-somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000 chem-

icals for possible use in the everyday foods we
eat. Today, according to the Food Protection
Committee of the National Research Council,

, 500 such chemicals are being added to various

foods to sweeten, color, preserve, thicken and

flavor them. Others, not technically additives, «

are used as pest-killers and growth-producers
and Wind up in the finished product, too.
ONLY 150 HARMLESS

Of the 500 additives, only 150 are con-
sidered harmless. Another 100 are. recog-
nized to be potentially dangerous, but are
considered safe when used with caution.

But fully 150 are, in the words of Bradshaw
Mintener, Assistant Secretary of Health, “in a
scientific no-man’s land. They are in use, but
have not been adequately tested.”

Ever since the turn of the century, the gov-
ernment has been keeping a police eye for
dangerous food and drug products. But as the
present law is written, any manufacturer can
put anything he wants into his food products
—without even pre-testing it—and can con-
tinue to do so until the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration tests the additive and finds it to
be dangerous. The law is punitive. It is not
preventive.

This means that, practically speaking, un-
til someone keels over sick, or until some
complaint is registered, potentially harmful
ingredients can be pumped into the nation’s
food supply with impunity, if it is profitable
or technically useful to do so. If Uncle-
Sam’s attention is called to it, he will go to
work on the case. But a recent Food and
Drug Administration report reveals that the
government simply cannot cope with the im-
mense laboratory job involved. According
to the FDA, it has a 25-year backlog of test-
ing to do in the single field of coal tar dyes

. alone.

Today there is virtual agreement,leven from
the food industry, thatsome "law requiring the
processor to pre-test chemical -food additives“ is

. desirable.‘ But, cancer specialists like Dr. Wil-

.,'

liam E. Smith, executive secretary of the Can-

alarmed that no bill before Congress would un-

equivocally rule out the use of cancer-inducing
agents.

_By not ﬂatly banning the introduction of
such agents into the food supply, Smith points
out, we are forcing consumers “to participate

ure.”

and exposed as a con man. Floods were busting out all over

about a Los Angeles cop-except Mickey Cohen. Other im-
portant events were: ‘

“gratitude” for American tax money and arms. ' .

, O The United States protested to Soviet Russia that “road

travel of Americans inside that country. .

0 In the words of AFLCIO network commentator, J oh
W. Vandercook, “the Russians have offered to meet us, not
halfway, but at least part of the way, in accepting what Pres-v
ident Eisenhower has called - his ‘open sky’ proposal. Chunks
of eastern Siberia and parts of western Russia and of the
satellite areas would be unveiled to the sharp eyes of U. S.
reconnaissance planes, if, in exchange, we let Soviet aerial

O U. S. Senator Wayne Morse (D., Ore.) called “upon the

by halting its nuclear test explosions right now and challeng .
ing Russia to do the same.” 7

Cost ot Living

0 The government reported that living costs rose to an-
other record level in April for the eighth straight month. A
sharp increase in food_prices was the major reason. Meanwhile,
statistics were published showing that food prices _have
creased $50 a year each year for the past ten. '-

0 Leon Keyserling, former chairman of the President's
Economic Advisers under President ‘Truman said that the
wages of American workers, far from advancing too rapidly
as has been claimed by the Eisenhower administration, are —
actually too low for the productive power of the economy. '_
He said that by 1960 American wage income should be 20
per cent higher than it is now if the economy is to continue
to expand as it should. , _ ’

O Harvard’s Prof. John Kenneth Galbraith supported la-
bor’s demand for a governmental investigation of price in-
creases.

O The Wall Street Journal upset the goofball claim that
America has been enjoying “profitless prosperity.”_ The big
business newspaper reported a rosy world of high profits in
its quarterly survey of business conditions. _ '

O The United Mine Workers Journal charged that “the
monetary policies of the Federal government are hidden
weapons that . . . do take hard-earned dollars out of your
pocket--and put them in the pockets of the big bankers . . .
The administration is playing a dangerous game when it
hampers economic growth by making it difficult for the na- —.
tion’s most important market—the working population——.to
buy back the goods they themselves produce.” .

O The Department of Commerce reported that twice as
many persons held two or more jobs in mid-1956 as compared
with the number in 1950 when a previous survey was made.
“Multiple job holding” is greatest among married men and
has been on the increase since the cost of living has » sky-
rocketed. The survey showed the extent to which American
workers are dependent on holding more than one job at the
same time. The report said that 71/2 per cent of all employed
married men had more than one job.

Civil Liberties

O The Supreme Court of the United States held:

I. That Rudolph Schware of New Mexico should be 
mitted to practice law. The court said, in an 8 ‘to 0 decisi‘(’_>1* .
that “We conclude that his past membership in the Communist
party does not justify the inference that he presently has bad
moral character.” ‘ ~

2. In the case of Raphael Konigsberg of California: that

make failure to answer questions a basis for exclusion from
the practice of law.

3. That the Justice department lacks authority to ban

0 Last January, the Supreme Court threw out the convic-
tion of Ben Gold, former president of the Furriers union, on

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

‘Codes of Ethics’
Won't Stop Attacks

THE DAVE BECK rumble has inspired a rash of press
releases from a number of union headquarters. They boast of
new “codes of ethics” and other rules of the road for the conduct
of union business.

The new codes are intended to prove that their authors
despise Dave Beck, detest plundering of the union treasury, are
madly in love with rank-and-file, and Wouldn’t be caught dead
placing a sawbuck on the "fourth race at Santa Anita.

A Some labor officials are finding trade union democracy
’ pretty heady stuff. Like Grandma after her first double martini,
they are Wondering how long this has been going on.

1 , No ‘Bribes Allowed

Some let their enthusiasm get the upper hand. One union's
' head man went so far as to issue an order that his payrollers
must not accept bribes or gifts from employers.

Mine-Mill members can look a code of ethics in the
eye and say, “who needs it?” If trade union democracy and
rank-and-file control of finances and other union business is
brand-new to some organizations, it certainly isn’t to Mine-
Mill. Can you imagine what would happen to a Mine-Mill

_ officer who issued a proclamation that no organizer could
accept a bribe from an employer? The members would
throw him out of office if only because they’d consider he
lost his marbles. To a Mine-Mill member, it would make as
much sense to issue a directive that no union employee could
commit murder, or take a part-time job as a shift boss in a
mine.

The rock of Mine-Mill's strength has been its membership
control of _every phase of trade union 1ife——elections, finances,
collective bargaining, constitutional requirements, conventions,
and policies.

lhe Difference

V Some of the new codes of ethics are coming from unions
that elect -officers in conventions that are held as infrequently
as every five years. Their negotiations are held without in-
volving the membership. The secret ballot is unknown to them,
and conventions have been gatherings of payrollers and machine
men. Their members do not control their dues rates or their
union’s finances. .
~ ..It is a fact that the vast majority of labor unions are

run honestly and don’t need the “help” of Senator McClellan
or any other outsider in administering their affairs. It
is also a fact that there is too much fear of membership-
control some unions.
,Mine-Mi_ll’s democratic traditions and safeguards are too
strong for any would-be racketeer, bureaucrat, or “iron man”
to take it over. Our “code of ethics” has been part of union
law and practice for 64 years. .
This. _inner-democracy is why raiding outfits like the Steel-
workers" break their backs in trying to convince Mine-Mill
members _that they would be .better off if “liberated” from a

unionfconstitution that gives them more rights than any other

‘union in America.

Codes No Substitute

The ethics now being broadcast by many unions are good
ethics for the most part. It isn’t the ethics that are wrong;
it’s the fact that the new codes in many instances are substitutes
for fighting back against the anti-union drive in Congress.

' It does little good to boast about your clean ears while
McClellan and Goldwater are spraying you with mud and
hatching schemes to take away your rights on the grounds
that you look like a bum.

' Trade unionists will say “amen” to the principles in the

new codes, but most of them will know that such umbrellas
are poor protection against the block-busters now being fash-
ioned in Congress and corporation executive offices for use
against ALL unions, regardless of past or future practices.

’ Labor must insist on the preservation of its rights. Anti-
labor laws—and Taft-Hartley is a noteworthy example——are
not meant to protect the membership’s right to run its own
affairs, but exactly the opposite——to make outside interference
easier.

Outside Interference

- The tendency toward outside interference in union affairs
becomes slightly ridiculous when a union votes in convention
to set up a “watchdog committee” composed entirely of out-
siders to guide union affairs. This is far from democratic

. and can lead to the veto of rank-and-file actions and desires.

Such a committee of non-trade unionists could interfere with the

W-L5-normal processes of collective bargaining and legislative ac-

\

V right to strike.

tivity. It is sometimes difficult for a non-member to under-
stand the advantages of the union shop and protection of the

.Some kind of booby prize should go to the guy in the
Teamsters union who conceived the idea of hiring a public
relations firm on New York’s Madison avenue to win friends
and influence people. Madison Avenue is the street where
the nation’s advertising agencies and glorified soap peddlers
ply their trade.

. The first recommendation of the press agents was to
fire the Teamsters’ boss. This kind of recommendation, it must

 be said, is not the responsibility of a press agent, but is the

   
  

property of the rank-and-file. ’Madison avenue, paved with the
advertising gold of the nation’s largest corporations, can now
dictate that a union cannot strike because it would be “bad
public relations.” At any rate, that’s what will happen if out-
siders continue to interfere with unions.
V The Steel union was one of the first to transfer union policy-
making from the membership to non-unionists. It is common
‘tscuttlebutt in the labor movement that General Counsel Arthur
Goldberg, and not ‘David’ McDonald, is the real head of that
union.‘ It may explain why Steel is run more like a Rotary club
than a" union. ' .

money. “Caesar’s Hour”, for instance, cost
NBC a cool $115,000 - per week. Even. that
much didn’t save the show from being done ‘
in by Lawrence Welk’s “champagne music”
on a rival network. Some people may think

Deadline June 30

DEN VER———N o b o d y knows exactly how
many disabled workers will actually receive the
benefits Congress intended when the new social
security disability program goes into effect at
the end of this month. Evidence is beginning to
pile up that proportionately few will, if the
rigid rules of eligibility being applied by the
social security agencies are allowed to stand.

According to recent estimates, about 700,000
disabled persons should be eligible to benefit
from the amendment to the Social Security act
which Congress approved last year. This applies
both for totally and permanently disabled work-
ers who have reached the age of 50 as well
as for those not yet 50 who can protect
their rights to future benefits through freezing
their social security records so that the years
they do not work will not be counted against
them. In either case, applicants must have
filed their claims either for the payments or
freeze by June 30, or face loss of benefits.

Rigid Rules

With the first disability pension payments
scheduled to start July 1, Rep. Augustine B.
Kelley (D., Pa.) already has charged the Eisen-
hower administration with setting up such rigid
rules that a worker has to be practically headed
for the boneyard before he can qualify for the
disability benefits.

“The Eisenhower administration has
taken such a hard-minded attitude on this
p r o g r a m,” Kelley declared, “that the
v_vorker must just about be completely para-
lyzed, or else continuously unconscious, to
qualify‘ for benefits.”

Calling for immediate action to correct the
situation, Kelley said: “I am afraid that very
few deserving workers are going to benefit
from the new social security disability pension
program unless Congress launches an investiga-
tion of present administrative policies and
cracks down hard.”

A similar demand for pubic hearings “on
the inequities that have -arisen in regard to the
administration of the social security disability
program”. has been voiced by Rep. Carl D.
Perkins '(D. Kentucky).

Tough Definition

Perkins referred to the gross misinterpreta-
tion of eligibility given by the Social Security
Administration in a government pamphlet. ex-
plaining the new program. “I submit,” he said,
“that the record shows that Congress did not
anticipate so‘ rigid a definition of permanent
and total disability as the flat statement that it
must be so severe that it prevents you "from
doing any kind of work.”

The Kentucky coal-mining district con-
gressman cited a number of cases in which
deserving disabled workers had been ruled
ineligible for the new benefits and said: “I
am greatly concerned that the law pres-
ently on the books must not be distorted by
administrative action so as to cheat people

Labor, Congressmen Fight  
Tough Disability Definition

out of the benefits which Congress intended
them to have.”

The definition in the Social Security Act
amendment setting up the qualifications for
total and permanent disability, to which both
congressmen referred, says: “The term ‘dis-
ability’ means inability to engage in any sub-
stantial gainful activity by reason of any medi-
cally determinable physical or mental impair-
ment which can be expected to result in death
or be of long continued and indefinite duration.”

Restrictive Standards

Reports show that not only are the stand-
ards of eligibility used by the social security
offices much more restrictive than the law
itself, but they are substantially more rigid than
those used by private insurance companies and‘
in collective bargaining agreements.

A study by the Longshoremen’s union on the
west coast, for instance, reveals that at least
one main Social Security officer there says
even the loss of two hands, arms or legs does
not necessarily constitute total disability, nor
does blindness in both eyes, if the applicant can
earn a third of what he was able to earn before
such disability. .

The Social Security administration re-
quires an applicant for disability benefits to
sign a statement agreeing to go through state
rehabilitation courses if they decide that this
might help him find employment in some new
line of work.

A social security agency might also decide
an applicant is able to work and earn a third
of what he used to make, and thus rule him
ineligible for benefits even though there’s no
guarantee that a man 50 years old or more who
is blind, legless or armless will actually get a
job when he looks for one. Even if there is no
job open for him in his own area, a man. that
the social security agency considers qualified
and apparently able to do _a certain kind of
work, despite his disability, is expected to move
to another area where he might be able to find
such a job.

Full Probe Asked

It is for reasons such as these cruel applica-

' tions of the law that Mine-Mill has joined with

liberal congressmen and other unions in de-
manding a full investigation and liberalization
of the new social security disability pension
program, so that the intention by Congress to
provide for the disabled will be carried out.

The union, meanwhile, again urges disabled
persons who, have worked for five years under
the social security law, who are unable to work
because of their disability and who have been
disabled for at least six months to apply either
for the benefit payments or to have their rec-
ords frozen for their future protection. Applica-
tions must be made at district social security
offices before June 30.

The fight to improve the law and its admin-

istration so as to provide proper protection for A

disabled workers can be made from there.

_ WASHINGTON——Concrete evidence of
its more recent pro-employer bias was in-
cluded in the 21st annual report issued by
the National Labor Relations board.

, Statistics released by the board sub-
stantiated charges by unions and liberals
in Congress that the NLRB had been
stacked by the Eisenhower administration
with friends of big business. During the
1956 fiscal, the board’s report showed, the
NLRB general counsel issued more unfair
labor practices complaints against unions
than against employers——for the first time
in 10 years. There were 399 complaints for
the year against unions and 314 against
employers. Prior NLRB reports, dating
back,to 1948, show that, except for 1955,
the number of complaints issued by the
general counsel had been heavily against
employers. As recently as 1952, com-
plaints against-employers ran five to one,
as compared with complaints against
unions.

The board’s report also showed that
unions have been winning a smaller
percentage of employee representation
elections. During the last fiscal year,
unions won 65 per cent of 4,946 elec-
tions, a new low. ‘ Another new low was
reached in “yes” votes, the unions get-
ting 63 per cent of the eligible votes.
It was a 10 per cent decrease below the -
preceding fiscal year, a 16 per cent loss
from -1953 when unions attracted 79
per cent of the eligible votes.

JUNE. 1951

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

News of the Industry

‘New Look’
Has Three

(SPECIAL TO MINE-MILL UNION)
_ BUTTE, Mont.—Mining operations at Butte
are taking on a “new look.” The “new loo ” for
Butte has three keys: The Greater Butte proj-

.. V ect, the Berkeley pit and the Northwest project.
‘f.Let’s take a look.

In its three-quarters of a century history, the
Butte district has produced 141/2 billion pounds

. of copper, 41/3 billion pounds of zinc, 21/2 billion

pounds of manganese in the form of manganese
nodules, and smaller quantities of lead, silver,
gold and other metals. Bringing out the metal-

— bearing ores has meant sinking a total of over

40 miles of vertical shafts with 2,550 miles of

‘ tunnels, stopes and passageways. While the
_ Butte mines have produced more copper and
. silver than any other district in the world,
“ today the Butte Hill is embarked on the biggest
' expansion in its tremendous history.

In past times the mining of Butte’s high

2 ; grade ores has been confined largely to the

veins which contain them. It was, and still is
vein mining in which the proportion of ore to

7 waste is small.

Efficient Equipment
_tWhen the price of copper is satisfactory, it

?_has. become economical to mine lower grade
ores with the more efficient handling equipment

which has been developed. This means that
ores with as little as 1.0 percent copper can be
mined and the metals extracted at a cost which
permits its sale in our competitive economy. It
also means that the low grade ores, containing
less copper, must be mined and processed in
large quantity to make it worthwhile. A large
area’ in the eastern part of the Butte hill con-
tains this type of ore, not suited to selective
vein mining.

— The Greater Butte project is concerned with
these lower grade ores. So another phase is
added to the Butte language—“block caving,”
which is a large scale, low cost method. Key
to this vast project is the Kelley shaft, one of
the largest concreted vertical hoisting shafts in
the country. Large blocks of the low grade

copper-bearing material are undercut and al-
i lowed to cave and crush from their own weight,
dropping into underground mine cars to be
hauled to a main shaft and then hoisted to the
surface. More than 180 million tons of this low
grade type of ore suitable for “block caving”
are already known to be available above the

3,400-foot level and there are vast unknown
tonnages continuing on below.

The first ore was hoisted through the Kelley
shaft in April of 1952. This is the first key of
Butte’s “new look,” chiefly visible by the big
headframe, hoists, and ore bins at the Kelley

1 Mine. The second one is easier to see. It is the

Berkeley Pit,'which is also concerned with low
grade ‘copper ore bodies.

Open Pit Mining

While open pit mining has been practiced
for years, it is new at Butte. This method is
best adapted for mining that involves moving
great tonnages of material which are located
relatively near the surface—-near enough so
that the waste material can be stripped off an
carted away. -

During the development of the block caving
ore reserves for the Kelley mine, it became ap-
parent that another large tonnage of low grade
copper ore exists in an area beyond that which
had been outlined for block caving and that
these ores could be mined by large scale open
pit methods. The Berkeley pit area was mapped

(Anaconda Company Photo)

THE BERKELEY PIT of the Anaconda company at Butte, Mont., is named for the old Berkeley mine, once a

famous lode-mining producer in the Meaderville area. The Butte mines have produced more copper and

silver than any other district in the world. Until 1954, Butte's properties were mined by conventional stope

and fill methods and by underground block-caving operations. Two years ago trial runs for open-pit oper-
fationwere taken in small bodies of are. They worked out satisfactorily, and a large section in south-
‘eastern "Butte was marked out for open-pit operations.

company’s precipitation plant. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of copper are recovered each month by
this means. .

Key Operations

out, the surface stripping of the waste material-

began in March, 1955. Production of ore started
in December, 1955 and a year later reached a

rate of about 10,000 tons a day. With at least~~-v--#s. '

100 million tons of _ore containing 0.8 of a per
cent copper already proven, drilling goes on ;to
develop additional reserves.

Finally, there is the Northwest project on
which work is now getting under way. Big in
scope, this project will be the means of adding
further large _tonnages of high grade ores to
Butte’s potential production. It will explore and
develop a large known area in the northwest
segment of the district that cannot be econom-
ically reached from presently operating shafts
because the distances have become too great.
It will also provide relief for deep level hoisting
problems at several of the older mines.

Two New Shafts

Work is well under way on construction and
preparing for shaft sinking for the Northwest
project. There will be two new mine shafts.
The Ryan shaft, for hoisting ores, will be as
large as the famous Kelley shaft but about a
thousand feet deeper. Plans call for an initial
capacity of 7,500 tons of ore a day which may

later be expanded. Its two electric hoists will ..

be the largest in the country. The collar of the
Ryan shaft has already been concreted. The
other shaft ' is a somewhat smaller one to be
known as the Missoula shaft. It will provide
facilities for service and supplies for the Ryan

and is well located for the development and

mining of the northwest area. Actual shaft
sinking at both sites is planned for the sum-
mer of 1957. ‘

That’s the long term View for the Butte

"district-—gr’owing and expanding—above

ground and below.

'No Union' Vote
Rewarded by Cut

SALYER, Calif.—-Workers at the Pat Veneer
plant here, who voted “No Union” in an NLRB
election last February, have received a back-
handed “thank you” from management in the
form of a substantial wage cut.

Announcement of the wage cut came
shortly after official notification of the certified
results of the recognition election. Some 40
employes were affected. The vote was 22 to
11 for “no union.” The Wage cut was set at
15 per cent of the hourly rate, dropping the
minimum rate from $2 to $1.70 per hour.

Health Funds
Asked

DENVER—More funds for
an adequate occupational
health program in the metal
mining industry has been
urged on Congress by Mine-
Mill. The request was made
by Secretary-Treasurer Albert
Pezzati in a letter. May 27 to
Senator Lister Hill, chairman
of the Subcommittee on Labor,
Health, Education and Wel-
fare.

Expressing concern at the
failure of Congress to appro-
priate sufficient funds to en-
able the Public Health Serv-
ice to meet its responsibilities
in this field, Pezzati pointed
out that the occupational
health program of the Public
Health Service is in a position
“to perform extremely valu-
able services in this industry,”
particularly in the field of sili-
cosis and other pulmonary
dust diseases. More funds are
needed in the present budget
to carry this program out, he
said.

At the same time, Mine-Mill
locals in the western mining
states were asked to write
their senators urging support I
for the necessary Health Serv-
ice appropriations.

 

In  .|9_ éﬁilﬁbﬁt

‘brought some 150 men a contract which compares fa-
eements in the district that

have been in existence for
as long as 13 years.

The company, a copper-zinc
property not yet in produc-
tion, is located in the Chelms~
ford area, and promises to be
one of the larger operations
in the district when it is in full
swing. A mill is now being
built and some production is
expected this Fall.

DISTRICT PATTERN

The agreement, signed for
a one-year term, provides for
a body of clauses, covering all
aspects of working conditions,
which are as good as and in
some instances better than
those included in the Inco and
Falconbridge agreements. The
district pattern has been fully
met on all protective sections
of the contract while for the
first time employees will re-
ceive time and one-half for
overtime, collar to collar; call
out time; vacations, statutory
holidays, shift premium; health
and welfare protection and in-
surance coverage.

In part, the first agreement
calls for six statutory holi-
days; shift premium of 4, 6
and. 8 cents an hour; vaca-
tions of one Week after one
year and two weeks after
three years; the P. S. I. Blue
Plan and Blue Cross Compre-
hensive plan for medical, sur-
gical and hospital coverage
with the company paying half
the cost; a $1,000 double in-
demnity life insurance plan
and a $30 a week sickness and
accident plan with the com-
pany paying half the cost.

With the property not yet in
production, the men agreed to
continue on the 48-hour week
but with full intention to cut
hours to the district 40 hours
per week in the next agree-
ment. Wage scales, which were
increased by the company dur-
ing the organizing drive in an
effort to head off the union,
were adjusted for several
classifications with increases
ranging up to five cents an
hour, and the agreement was
concluded on rates ranging
from $1.50 an hour to $2.10.
Because of the 48 hour week
take-home pay equals and ex-
ceeds the district pattern.

Miami Petition

MIAMI, Ariz.——A petition by
Miami Miners Union No. 586
for an election at the new mill
of Inspiration Consolidated
Copper Co. here has been or-

 

-dered reinstated by the Na-

tional Labor Relations Board
in Washington. The Washing-
ton order over-ruled a previous
dismissal of Mine-Mill’s peti-
tion by the regional NLRB
and directed that a hearing be
held.

Although the mill is brand
new and only recently went
into operation, the regional
board had claimed that a con-
tract held by the Operating
Engineers in another part of
the property extended to the
new operation thereby consti-
tuting a bar to an election at
this time. The Miami Miners
appealed the dismissal and the

'Washington board upheld the

appeal. The hearing is expect-
ed shortly.

Low Interest Sparks
Uranium City Boom

URANIUM CITY, Sask. —
Now that negotiations have
been completed at Eldorado
Mining and Refining Limited
with the new two-year agree-
ment being drafted and read-
ied for signing, bargaining at
other units will progress rap-
idly following the pattern set
at Eldorado.

After five months of bar-
gaining at Eldorado the Com-
mittee was able to recommend
a settlement that contained
wage increases averaging 6
per cent retroactive to Janu-
ary 1, 1957, with a 5 per cent
increase across the board for
1958, an improved welfare
plan, and a company financing
housing plan that enables an
employee to borrow a maxi-
mum of $5,000.00 at interest
rates of 1 per cent for the
first year, 2 per cent for the
second, and 3 per cent for the
third and 4 per cent there-
after. Provision is also made
to allow employees to pur-
chase building materials thru
the company at cost price, ef-
fecting a great saving.

New homes are already
going up all over town, with
a lot more activity being
planned for the coming

months as early June will
see the start of water trans-
portation bringing in build-
ing materials in great quan-
tities.

Check-off of union dues won
this year at Eldorado is a very
valuable clause, where bank
check-off has been the meth-
od of dues payments for sev-
eral years with the bank
charging 25c per member for
the service, a costly adminis-
tration expense that afforded
no benefits to the member-
ship, so already the check-off
is proving to be a very popu-
lar victory.

The extension of the El-
dorado mill which will dou-
ble production, and the con-
struction of the new 750 ton
Lorado mill are nearing
completion, and will give
mines like Cayzor, St. Mich-
aels, Cinch Lake, National
Explorations, Black Bay, a
means of treating their ore.
The mills will probably be
enlarged as production in-
creases in the surrounding
area.

Confidence won’t help you
much unless you have some-

thing on the ball to back it up.

SUDBURY, Ont.-—A ctive
participation of Local 598
membership in the scheduled
Mass Chest X-Ray Survey was
further indicated in the attend-
ance of a Union committee at
a meeting on April 30 in the
Parish Hall of the Church of
the Epiphany, of the T. B.
Mass Survey Committee to
hear an address by Dr. S. A.
Holling of the Department of
Health. 1

The Union Committee,
headed by President Mike
Solski, included T. Paradis,
W. Bryant, E. Johansson, J.
Benoit, A. Heppner, C. Pat-
terson, R. Carter, T. Walsh
and J. MacWilliam. Earlier
last month, President Solski
joined the Sudbury and Dis-
trict Tuberculosis Associa-
tion as a vice-chairman of
the association.

In his address to the meet-
ing, Dr. Holling pointed out
that tuberculosis was the
Number One health problem
in the country. He explained
that press reports statingthat
tuberculosis had ceased to be
a serious problem has caused
the public to be apathetic
about this disease. The -prob-P

able reasonfor such reports, 1

he said, is the drop in the
death rate and the fact that
some sanatoriums have empty
beds. 0

It was pointed out that new
drugs were responsible for the
drop in the death rate rather
than the decline in the num-
ber of cases of T.B. New drugs
are also instrumental in les-
sening the time of treatment,

meros pagos de pensiones por
incapacidad el 1 de julio, el
Representante, Augustine B.
Kelley (D., Pa.) ya ha acusa-
do a la administracién de
Eisenhower de haber estable-

lcido reglamentos tan rigidos

que el obrero tiene que literal-
mente estar con un pie en el
sepulcro antes de poder cali-
ficarse para los beneficios de
incapacidad.

“L a administracién d e
Eisenhower ha tornado una
actitud tan necia en este pro-
grama,” declaré Kelley, “que
el obrero casi tiene que
estar completamente parall-

' zado, o estar continuamente
desmayado, para poder ser

_ calificado a recibir los bene-

ficios.”

Exigiendo accién inmediata
para corregir la situacién,
Kelley dijo, “Temo que muy
pocos trabajadores que lo
merezcan Van a recibir el bene-
ficio del nuevo programa de
pensiones por incapacidad del
seguro social a menos que el
Congreso inicie una investi-
gacién de los actuales pro-
cesos administrativos e im-
ponga medidas correctivas.”

Se ha presentando una de-
manda similar por el Repre-
sentante Carl D. Perkins (D.
Kentucky) “sobre las injusti-
cias que han nacido con re-
specto a la administracion del
program de incapacidad del
seguro social.” '

DEFINICION DURA

Perkins se referia a la plena
mal interpretacién de ineli-
gibilidad dada por la Admi-
nistracién del Seguro Social
en un folleto del gobierno que
explicaba el nuevo programa.
“Someto,” él dijo, “que los
archivos demuestran que el
Congreso no anticipaba tan
rigida definicién de incapaci-
dad permanente o incapacidad
total en la forma de una de-
claracién definitiva de que
debe ser la incapacidad tan
severa que impide que uno
haga cualquier clase de tra-
bajo.”

El representante de un
distrito minero de carbén de
Kentucky cité un mimero de
casos en los cuales obreros
incapacitados habian sido
declarados ineligibles. para
recibir los nuevos beneficios
y dijo: “Me preocupa mu-
chisimo que la ley, actual-
mente en los libros, no de-
biera ser torcida por accién
administrativa en tal forma
que niega al pueblo los
beneficios que era la inten-
cién del Oongreso que tu-
vieran.

La definicién de la enmi-
enda al Acta del Seguro So-
cial asentando las califica-
ciones de incapacidad total e
incapacidad permanente, a la
cuales se referia el Repre-
sentante, dice: “El término ‘in-
capacidad’ significa la inha-
bilidad de desempeﬁar ninguna
actividad completa para ga-
narse la Vida por razén de
atrofia mental o fisica que sea
determinable y que pueda re-
sultar en la muerte individuo
o que sea de duracién larga e
indefinida.” .

ESTANDARS RESTRICTIVOS

Los informes indican que
los estandars de eligibilidad
que se usan por la oficina del

Seguro Social no solo son mas‘

restrictlvos que la ley misma,
sino que son mucho mas rigi-
dos que aquellos que se usan
por las empresas particulares
de seguros y en los acuerdos
colectivos de negociaciones.
Un estudio llevado a cabo
por el sindicato de Estivadores,
por ejemplo, revela que al
menos un funcionario princi-
pal del Seguro Social alli, dice

Los Triunfadores del Referendum

DENVER-—Se Votaron un
cambio en la Mesa Ejecutiva

endas a la Constitucién Inter-

manos, brazos 0 piernas, no
necesariamente constituye in-
capacidad total, ni tampoco
quedar ciego en ambos ojos,
si el solicitante puede ganarse
la tercera parte de_ lo que
podia ganar anterior a dicha

- incapacidad.

La administracién del Se-
guro Social requiere que el
solicitante de beneficios por
incapacidad firme una decla-
racién diciendo que esta dispu-
esto a pasar por los cursos de
rehabilitacién del estado si es
que ellos deciden que el ha-
cerlo le ayudaria a é] a encon-
trar empleo en algﬁn ramo
nuevo de trabajo.

Una agencia del Seguro So-

cial también pudiera decidir

que el solicitante puede traba-
jar y ganarse la tercera parte
de lo que ganaba, y en esa
forma declarlo ineligible a
recibir beneficios aunque no
haya garantia que un hombre
de cincuenta aﬁos de edad o
mas que esté. ciego, sin piernas

empleo cuando lo busque.
Aunque no haya trabajo en su
propia vecindad o pueblo, un
hombre que la agencia de Se-
guro Social considera califi-
cado‘ y aparentemente con la
habilidad de hacer cierta clase
de trabajo, a pesar de su in-
capacidad-, se espera que se
mude a otra area donde pueda
encontrar dicho empleo.

Es por razones tales como
estas crueles aplicaciones de
la ley que el Mine-Mill se ha
unido a los Representantes
liberales y a otros sindicatos
en exigir una investigacién
completa y una liberaliza-

AMENDMENTS

The f 0 ur amendments re-
ceiving membership approval
in the unofficial returns all
concerned union finances in
v the U. S. The autonomous Ca-
nadian membership did not
vote on amendments.

The key amendment win-
ning membership approval
was Proposition No. 3 which
increased per capita payments
from local unions from $1.25
to $1.75 per month, a raise of
50 cents. Approved in the
same amendment was an in-
crease in the minimum local
union dues rate from $2.50 to
$3. The minimum does not af-
fect locals ‘already paying $3
or more per month dues.

Proposition No. 1 gave the
first salary increase to inter-
national officers, board mem-

 bers, and representatives since
1951. It is a 20 per cent in-

~ crease, raising salaries as fol-

lows:

International p r e s id c n t,
from $6,750 to $8,100 per year.

International vice-president
and secretary-treasurer, from
$6,300 to $7,560.

Executive board members,
from $5,850 to $7,020.

International r e p r e s e n t-

atives, from $90 to $108 per
week.

Starting rate for interna-
tional representatives, f r o In
$78.75 to $94.50 per week.

PER DIEM

The second proposition ap-
proved was one raising per
diem expense _ allowances for
international officers, b o a r d
members, and staff members

 6" from $11 to $15 while away

from home overnight.

A n o t h e r amendment ap-
proved raising the initiation
fee to the International union
from $1 to $2.50. It also raises
the constitutional minimum
local union initiation fee from
$2 to $5, and the maximum
from the present $10 to $15.

The secret ballot referen-
dum took place in the midst
of s c a n d a 1 s rocking some

‘ A unions which do not have the

democracy existing in ‘Mine-
Mill. While demands it were
forthcoming from the rank
and file of several unions for
more democratic elections, fi-
nancial control, and constitu-

tions, Mine-Mil1’s membership
went to the polls. as it has
since 1893, protected by the
most democratic constitution

Look Who's Pious
About Racketeers

NEW YORK —— A reader of
The Wall Street Journal, who
has no use for labor racketeer-
ing, has equally no use for
management racketeering, as
the following letter printed by
the businessmen’s bible indi-
catés:

“Editor, The Wall Street Jour-
nal:

“Of course no one can con-
done a system that forces a
man to pay tribute to a union
in order to earn his living and
then permits that tribute to be
stolen by union racketeers.

“But is this really any‘
worse than some of the cur-
rent practices of big bus-
iness? Unconscionable sal-
aries (some approaching $1
million a year), incentive
d e fer re d compensation,
bonuses, pensions, stock op-
tions and many other hidden
perquisites are common.

“And now the latest gim-
mick is the Florida vacation-
at stockholders’ expense. At
Bahia Mar, the big yacht basin
in Fort Lauderdale, last win-
ter there were between 400
and 500 large yachts.

“A survey showed that ap-
proximately 80 per cent were

ing from Chicago's airport, were these representatives of Mine-

Seaman, Frank Cirrigone (wearing light iacket), Charles Hester

and James Pinta.

owned by corporations, the di-
rectors and officers and their
wives and friends having a
wonderful vacation. ,

“And now it is extending
from yachts to houses! Florida
houses, costing in many in-
stances well over $100,000, are
owned by corporations and

used by the officers and direc-
tors——again at the expense of
the stockholders.

“Unless business will po-
lice its own house a way will
have to be found to police
it for them—perhaps by leg-
islation imposing personal
liability on directors who
permit expenditures for
other than strictly corporate
purposes. I

“Possibly Congress through
the SEC would put a stop to
these corporate shenanigans.
Certainly the legislatures of
several states could do so
with respect to the corpora-
tions chartered bythem.

“Racketeering is still rack-
eteering, whether practiced by
unions or management.”
