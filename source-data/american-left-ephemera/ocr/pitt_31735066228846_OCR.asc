-SUGGE$TIONS FOR A STUDY OF YOUR HOMETOWN.

This memorandum is written as if you were visiting Hometown for
the first time and as if your company or organization had ins-
tructed you to arrive as quickly as possible at a comprehensive
knowledge of Hometown so that you might effectively represent it
there. Towards the end of the memorandum, I shall have something
to say about the advantages you, with your long experience in

the community, would have over a newcomer in your 233 Hometown.

To do this job of community analysis, there are certain tools

you will obviously need. A map of the Hometown is your first
tool, for a brief glance at it will provide the trained eye with
more facts than could be secured from any other source. (This,
of course, depends upon the map; most street maps are featureless
without an accompanying street directory).

Once upon a time, about 1890 or before, American street direct-
ories were even more useful than they are today, but they are
still an indispensable part of any such investigation as this.
There are three principal divisions of the average directory:
(1) the alphabetical name section for individuals and business
firms, organizations, etc; (2) the street directory listing each
house or building, and usually each separate family or business
occupant of such buildings; (3) the classified introductory sec-
tion in narrative style, containing facts about the town statis-
tically arranged from the census and other sources; there is us-
ually also a section devoted to the city government, giving the
principal office holders, and often a great deal of detail about
the personnel of the various city services.

For the fastest orientation, it is ideal if you can find a series
of older maps of the city (usually accessible at the public lib-
rary) so that you can trace the characteristics of the city's
growth.

Before you have gone much further with your investigation, it
will be advisable to learn more about the earlier inhabitants.
For this purpose you will need another tool: one or more ‘vol-
umes of local history, usually to be found in the form of county-
wide accounts of the history and biographies of the area, with
sections devoted to the towns and cities in each county.‘

Other tools will be suggested later, but we shall start with those
mentioned and see whether after a week in town, we could arrive
at any understanding of its social structure._

Let us start first with the county history. Here we shall assign
fictitious names to typical characters. Sooner or later in the
county history we will come across the name of Jedediah Early

who was connected with the Early Trust Company; perhaps we shall
also be able to establish that William A. New Comer married one

of the Early girls. If we can also connect the Early and New-
comer families with the founding of the Hometown Manufacturing
Company, we have a good running start on a reconstruction of the
way people have earned their "Living in Hometown for many years.‘

. ‘ s

There are probably in the county history many names of families
who have moved away, and'others whose names have died out, at
least ingthe direct line, although middle and even first names
may survive, ' ,. .- A ‘ ". - ,;*'-
The~quickeSt Way to find out where the major economic decisions

are made in Hometown is to go to the public library and ask to

see a copy of Rand McNally's Banker's Register (if the library

does not have it, go to one of the"local banks). There you

_will find the names of all the Hometown banks as of the year of
publication; however, because of the mortality of banks after

1929, there are great advantages in looking up in two volumes:

the current one and one prior to l929. Take this list of banks

and look up another publication, Moody’s Banks. Here you will find
the names of the directors of your Hometown Banks, together with

the history of the mergers which have taken place and which have
contributed to the present condition of these banks. In this

book, there will also be found a correct bank statement of assets

and liabilities, and probably the dividend record.

Another set of tools becomes necessary : a card file. Some people
prefer 3"x 5" because they are handy to carry; others use 5”x 8"
because they provide more space for notations. Use one card for
each bank and record the names of the directors on the ruled side
and the history of the bank on the reverse, unruled side. Then
make a separate card for each bank director, with his name (last
name first) in the upper left-hand corner. Put his address if it

is available on the top, right, and his directorships (with his
principal connection on top) in the middle. On the reverse side

of the card record his personal history, date of birth and parentage
at the top, marriage, children, education, etc.. These cards should
be alphabetically filed in the boxes in which the cards were bought,
thus dispensing with the added expense of buying special files.

Card files become your most important source of information, and
you will find that it is necessary to cross-reference them constant-
ly. They constitute the basic difference between our approach and
that of the census-taker; we are primarily interested in indivi-
duals and their patterns of relationship, while he is interested

in the overall statistical aggregates.

With the list of bank directors in hand, turn now to another tool

, volume: Poor's Register of Directors. Here are listed all the

most important corporate directors in the United States. These

men do not always record their directorships, but the listing

is as complete as the editors are able to make it on the basis

of their investigations. From Poor‘s Register, you can find the
other corporate directorates held by Hometown bank directors.

This will lead you at once to the names of all important Hometown
businesses, for banks tend to accumulate to themselves all the
leading financial and business talent in town. This-method of anal~
ysis will be successful provided Hometown’s bank is not part of

a chain of banks which merely maintains a manager in your town.

But unless your town is very small it did once have a bank, and not
so very long ago, so that a study of earlier editions of the volumes
cited above will reveal the names of Hometown’s bank directors.

Such volumes as these may not be available in many cities and tOWnSm
but if there is a university in the neighborhood, its library may
_(3a1:‘:I.'y them; they shou'Ld also be found in large city public libraries.

.

In many cities there are often business libraries attached to
the chamber of commerce, or elsewhere, and usually your Home—v
town banks subscribe to some or all of these publications

If, among its successful sons who have moved away, your town‘
numbers a broker in some big city or a metropolitan banker,

a letter to him may bring your library a copy of one or'more=of
these volumes which, although perhaps a few years out of date,
will still be useful for your general purposes The names of
the directors of your banks for the current year can be ascr-
tained by asking the local bank for a copy of its annual state-
ment, which is usually published in a small folder on the back
cover of which is a list of directors, Business connections
which are not corporate, such as partnerships or firms, ﬁﬁil
usually be found in your street directory.

Turn now to the Hometown Manufacturing Company in your direc-
tory where the names of its officers and chief supervhory emp-
loyees will probably appear. This will enable you to plot

on the map the residences of superintendentssof foreman, and
operating management, You will find that while only the top
men live on High Steeet or in "Hills and Dales," the others
tend to live as closd to these neighborhoods as they can afford,
the older men nearer High Street, the younger nearer "Hills and
Dales."

A number of directories also designate the place of employment
of those who work in the Hometown Manufacturing Company by some
such mark as "Hometown Mfg ,” for example. This will enable
you to plot on the map the residences of those employed at the
factory . when the craft or special skill of the worker is also
indicated, as it is in most directories, you can find out where
the several grades of workers live. (It should be understood
that the word "grades" as used here, has a purely technical
usage, such as "machinist" or”foreman" and is a means of dis-
tinguishing‘the-probable wage received, since thisitends to det-
ermine what rent workers can pay, and other economic facts we
are trying to establish). 7

Once you have begun to accumulate cards for individual res-
idents in different parts of the city, and have markedtheir
cards according to their occupations,3ou are on the way to the
preparation of a residential map of the city. It will be ad-
visable to devise a system of symbols to designate the different
income grades and occupational groups, and attach them to in-
dividual residents on the map in order to show the approximate
location of their homes on the streets of the city.

Incidentally, if you are-enterprisingpne map bought from the
local bookseller who handles the Hometown street directories
will enable you to trace any number of copies on transparent
paper. Once you have plotted on your maps the location'bf'your
bank directors, corporation directorsg, superintendents, fore-
men, and workers in the factory, you are ready to branch-out.into
a neighborhood by neighborhood investigation of Hometown:

this will include its churches,neighborhood and nationality
clubs, formal and informal social groups, political.and business

groups, etc.

Such an investigation will lead you back in the direction of

your census materials, which are also to be found in the public
library. But the model for the investigation is not to be found
in the publications of social workers. For information about
census tracts, it will be necessary to approach someone connected
with a public or private charity, or a governmental office deal-
ing with welfare or relief. In many cities (and their number

is increasing), students have made area studies of the different
neighborhoods, showing the number of cases of social maladjust-
ment, such as juvenile delinquency, which have been indicated

area by area on citynwide maps. This is one of the most fruitful
parts of any study you may make of Hometown. However, these find-
ings must be considered very carefully and you should avoid arriv-
ing at a hasty conclusion on the basis of any one type of case

as it appears on the map.

From this wealth of material, a comprehensive pattern of neighbor-
hood distribution of these various groups will emerge. By
turning to the street section of your Hometown directory, you may
be able to discover whether or not the resident is a homeowner
and sometimes whether he has a telephone. This information

will help to confirm your guesses about income status. By work-
ing back and forth between the street section and the alphabeti-
cal section of your volume, you will be able to verify your
sampling on a street basis. In this way you will soon know

a great deal about the distribution of Hometown population--
group by group—-class by class. If your company were interested,
for example, in a door-to-door campaign, this information would
be of considerable help. A

For some purposes, it may be necessary for your company to know
the national origins of different groups in the community. In
past times, many of these groups tended to live in their own sep-
arate neighborhoods and to develop separate national institutions,
such as churches, parochial schools, clubs and organizations of one
kind and another. Increasingly, these distinctions arising from
national origin are breaking down in this country. The younger
generation is tending to move to newer suburban developments

where they mingle with people of other national origins. This

is part of the "melting pot" of which the Americans are so proper-
ly proud. A study of your Hometown map as prepared by the method
described above will reveal, however, that the "melting" process
is far from complete in many communities.

Any study of local politics will reveal that politicians are aw-
are of group differences of all kinds, including those just des-
cribed, and that they are a factor in the political, social and
economic life of the community. By turning to the first sec-
tion of your Hometown directory where information about City
Hall and other city services is listed, a card file can be made
on the political structure of Hometown. A study of this file
will show that it reflects some of the divisions within the com-
munity, as already indicated in the foregoing.

The life of most communities is still dominated to a large extent
by the oldest inhabitants and their descendants. Usually, they
exercise the chief influence on the boards of local banks, and
insofar as businesses are locally owned, they tend to retain a
controlling interest. But today, this is by no means a univer-
sal pattern, since the influence of out—of~town corporations

has become more and more important in all but the leading cities
of the country. As the first approximation, we can say that

the social system of a community (With its various organizations,
such as the Community Chest, Red Cross, etc.) leans heavily upon
the families of those long-established in the community; the ec-
onomic leadership is drawn from the ranks of newer individuals and
groups; and the political leadership is even more frequently in
the hands of the representatives of newer groups.

To understand the social system of the community insofar as it

can be distinguished from the political and economic systems,

it is usually necessary to begin with the churches as the oldest,
local social institutions. These are in turn distributed through-
out the community, and a map showing their location will be very
énstructive and assist in pointing up some of your other findings.
lnce m°St °huTCh£s are not only religious, but neighborhood
social organizations, incorporating many non—religious activities,
a study of the leadership of these sub-groups within the church
will also contribute to your understanding of the community.

Any young businessman coming to the city for the first time and
expecting to establish residence there will want to know about
the other social and charitable organizations, their functions
and their representation of various groups. Some of these can
be called ” total community” organizations, (for instance, the

Community Chest or, within the business community, the Chamber of
Commerce. Others are representative of special groups in the
community. One of the most significant keys to the social grad-
ing system is to be found in the structure of the more exclusive
clubs. There is usually a club to which only the older inhab-
itants are admitted, and their method of choosing, even among
this older group displays their attitude as to the necessary

qualifications for membership in thelinner circle of their group.
If you can secure a list of their membership and compare it with
other organizations, churches, charities, and clubs, you will

have a useful key to the relationship between the older and new~
er groups in_town. ‘“

In this type of study, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that
getting a living is the backbone of community life and that the
jobs held by men and women are bound to be the ruling factors in
their lives. The increase of absentee ownership of factories
and stores, and even of newspapers and banks in towns and cities
of the United States, makes it more and more difficult to under-
stand the patterns of organization of individual communities.

To find out what is happening to these plants and businesses,

you need new tool volumes. For industries, consult Moody‘s (or
Poor's) Industrials. One or the other of these will give you

a picture of the extent to which your local factory is still loc-
ally controlled or to what extent control had passed to out—of-
town groups. While these sources are adequate for our present
purposes, if a really extensive study of these matters were being
made, it would be necessary to consult the records of the Secur-

-6...

ities and Exchange Commission in Washington. If. the language
used is unfamiliar, some acquaintance who has experience with
reading such source material should be called upon for help.
Here you may find that the local company (though still locally
owned? has perhaps undergone a series of mergers prior to
arriving at its present size; if you are interested in the his~
torical aspects of the community, it will be worthwhile study-
ing the companies that merged to form the existing one. The
story of your local, privately-owned electric light, gas,
water, and street transportation system or systems. A similar
tool volume is available for investigation of these companies
in Moody's (or Poor's) Public Utilities. All of these facts
should be recorded on file cards and properly catalogued.

In a short space of time, you will now have gathered a very comp-
rehensive picture of the life of Hometown. (The size of the com-
munity will, of course, determine the length of time this job
will take, although much will depend upon your previous ex-
perience in making such studies). I venture to say that you
will know many things about the community which might have es-
caped your notice even if you had lived there all your life.
Nevertheless, there are many things you cannot find out by these
mechanical methods. The most important facts which tend to
elude this approach are of a-personal order. It is essential

to live long years in a community in order to be aware of some

of the most important of these facts. As an outside observer,
or even one who has had a short residence in the community,

you cannot hope to find a completely adequate substitute for

this experience. However, as the representative of your com-
pany, you are expected to find a short~cut which will be the

best possible substitute for such long residence.

The best substitute for your own long residence is to gain
access to certain of the oldest inhabitants. Experience will
show that there are certain people of the community, not al-
ways members of the socially elect group, but frequently drawn
from among them, whose type of mind reproduces tha patterns
we,have just described, without resort to our complicated meth-

ods. Frequently, these individuals have recently retired
from the most influential positions in the community and are
still active in the local historical society. If you are '
properly introduced and they respect you as a scientific in-
vestigator and believe you have the best interests of the com-
munity at heart, they will often be of invaluable assistance
to you in providing that type of information which~can gener-
ally come only from a lifetime knowledge of their town or city.
You will do well to try to find at least one such person (and
if possible several)‘ who is willing to assist you and who will
talk to you freely. By working with more than one of these
individuals, you will be able to triangulate your results and
so avoid some of the inevitable effects of bias. Even the most
objective of these persons is bound to see the life of his
community from a slightly different vantage point than would
any other such observer. You must learn to make allowances
for these differences in point of view.

"If you, the reader, are yourself a lifelong resident of Hometown,

you will be able to supply the same sort of information as this
oldest inhabitant, and will want to correct your bias by the meth-
gas I have described. Nevertheless, a lifelong resident will
liave a great advantage over our supposed representative of an,
outaof-town company. You will know, for é%ample,.who married
whom, and what the grandparents and even the great-grandparents
of many of your fellow residents contributed to the life of the
community. Without having to make maps of the historical growth
of the community, you will know at what point im.time which sub-
urbs developed, and just when different local businesses came
under out—of-town control.

Without referring to the files of the local newspapers (which, by
the way, are indispensable to our visitor—observer) or having to
talk to the local newspaper editors, you will know just which ev-
ents in the life of Hometown are of the greatest importance in the
estimation of its citizens. You will know when crises arose in the
life of the community and how they were solved. Y5“ will know
what effect the depression and mass unemployment had on the town
or city and what happened when labor tried to orgﬁxize the local
plants and businesses. Above all, you will know the personalit-
ies and dispositions of the human beings who make up Hometown,

and you will realize what an important part such personal traits
can play in the average community. In short, these mechanical
methods I have recommended are bound to produce a de~humanized
picture. It is essential for the observer to try to restore the
characteristics of a living community, with its hopes and fears,
its shared pleasures and its sorrows.

One of the most elusive things you must try to understand is
"community spirit,” and in this connection, you must attempt to
discover what individuals or groups in the community hold the sym-
bols of community leadership at any given time.

Outside of the churches, there are two places to look for the sym-
bols of community integration. One of these focal points is
the cemetery and the other is the patriotic organization. :No

community, modern or ancient, can be understood without reference
to these two sets of facts. It has been said that "the most im-
portant people in Hometown are dead." Even to American society,
with its gaze fixed upon expansionism and the future, ancestors
are of great symbolic importance. If ancestors in general are
important, those who participated in our military history are

of great significance. Certain patriotic organizations in each
community tend to be regarded by the rest of the community as
safeguarding the symbols of patriotism. It is necessary to study
the structure of these patriotic organizations as an "important
factor” in the advancement of Hometown life, to be present on the
day of their most symbolic activity: Memorial Day, and watch the
course taken by the parade~- from High Street down through the
business section of the town and out to the oldest cemetery,

This will usually contribute many useful facts about the nature

of community spirit. a

 

181

All this is bound to sound like an overwhelming job; for the larn
gest cities of course, it is much to great an undertaking for any
single individual to carry out in a reasonable period of time,"
even as a first approximationgf Nevertheless, if you will re-

read these proposals with care, you will find ways and means for ,
shortcutting and sampling depending on the size of your commun- “%
ity; after operating with this outline for only a few weeks, ‘
the characteristics of your community will take on new signifi- '
canoe even if you have lived there all your life. '“
