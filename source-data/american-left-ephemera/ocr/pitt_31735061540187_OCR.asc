the U.S. between the end of the last century and the
thirties (these included Spencer's popular philosophy,
Jack London's and Rudyard Kip|ing’s novels and
President Theodore Roosevelt's speeches). The
period before World War I was marked by celebration
of the White Man, glorification of violence and war as
the Man's proper challenge, epical amplification of
colonial adventures and conquests. After World War
I the tone of this literature became more pathetic.
Both Madison Grant (in the book mentioned above)
and the philosopher Oswald Spengler (whose famous
book The Downfall of the West was praised by the
Nazis) mourn_ed the passing away of the dominant
white western civilization, as due to the moralistic
weakness of its present democratic political leaders.

At the turn of the century, anthropologists,
psychologists and physicians were pressured by the
dominant cultural concern to produce ”scientific”
criteria to prove the genetic superiority of the white
man over the non—white. The sons of the good old
families were also considered superior to working
class people. Man superior to woman. Such race,
class and sex. superiority of the White (upper class)
Man was considered a matter of good sense, not to
be discussed but just to be demonstrated. When
women, working class people and non-white Ameri-
cans were tested and found to be more perceptive,
quick and coordinated than the average by psycho-
motorial tests, the scientific explanation was that all
these people were more alert with their senses just
because their mind was more primitive. A positive
proof of superiority for the White upper class Man,
however, was still missing, until the LO. test was
introduced. To quote again historian Mark Haller:

”The introduction of Binet tests, which had been

developed for the diagnosis of feebleminded-

ness, produced remarkable and satisfying re-
sults. Wherever the tests were used in the early
and uncritical days, they appeared to show not
only that feeblemindedness was widely distri-
buted through the American population," but also
that most criminals, prostitutes, tramps, and
other undesirables were hereditary morons. The
tests also appeared to provide conclusive proof
that, except for Jews, those races that were
believed to be inferior were inferior in fact.”
(Hal|er, 1963)

During the 1930's the blatant and repulsive exten-
sion of eugenic thinking by the Nazis in Germany did
much to take away support for the eugenic move-
ment in the U.S. Not only did Hitler go too far with

10

his racism, but he also claimed for Germany too big a
share of the world. In addition, many sons of the
Jewish, German, Irish and Italian immigrants-the
targets of the old eugenic movement—-had been
integrated into the ruling or the middle class. They
had become respectable politicians, businessmen
and professionals, including scientists. These new
scientists, the sons of poor immigrants, could not
share the strict racist views of William McDougal|. By
the end of World War II it seemed that eugenic
ideas——which had helped the rise of the Fascist
powers—were no more to be taken into serious
consideration.

|.Q. THE NEW EUGENICISTS

In the past few years there has been a revival of
theories which claim to show inherited differences in
intelligence between races and social classes. On the
basis of their studies, the theorists have suggested
changes in social policy ranging from school segre-
gation to sterilization of the ”unfit.” Both the theories
and the policy suggestions have received a lot of
coverage in the media.

The ”new eugenicists” include A.R. Jensen,
R. Herrnstein, H.J. Eysenck, and W Shockley. In
general they argue that:

1—l.Q. measures intelligence

2—|.O. is an inherited trait (that is, your l.Q. score
depends almost exclusively on your genes)

3—— Non-white and lower class people have generally
lower |.Q.. scores (the average LC. of blacks is
lower than the average of whites, the teamsters'
lower than academics’, etc.)

4—Therefore, educational and social changes can
do nothing to improve the LO. of these people.

, So they conclude that lower class people—which

include most African and Spanish Americans-
generally deserve their social position, and neither
reforms nor revolutions can do anything about it.
They argue instead that if some individuals in the
lower classes are born with a high l.Q. trait, they will
rise by themselves to equally deserved upper class
positions. Furthermore, the new eugenicists argue
that the human race is deteriorating due to the
accumulation of undesirable genes and that such
process is accelerated by the softness of liberal
legislators, educators and social workers. Many of
them claim, more or less openly, that reproduction of

-.u——<—-y

~a——~——?-V

the intellectually unfit should be controlled and that
sterilization should be considered.

The first proposition of the new eugenicists is that
(.0. scores measure intelligence. A general objection
is that nobody knows exactly what intelligence is and
even less’ whether it can be measured all together by
scoring a person with one figure. In any case let's
take a look at how |.Q. is measured.

The /.0. test [Stanford-Binet] French psychologist
Alfred Binet designed the first |.Q. test in 1905 to pre-
dict the success or failure of children in the French
public school, largely middle class. The test was
constructed as an exam, consisting of a series of
items (like questions, puzzles, multiple-choice prob-
lems) graduated according to the child's age. Note
that the purpose of such a test was not—as in a_n
exam—to judge whether the child has studied with
profit, but to predict the child's future achievement
and career (at first, only his scholastic career) and
decide which kind of school would better fit him. So,
when the test was first tried on school children, it had
to be adjusted. Items that fit teachers’ estimates of
their pupils’ abilities or could be shown subsequently
to have predicted future achievements were retained;
other items were dropped or replaced. In this way the
test was made into a tool fit to measure a set of
attitudes useful in white middle class society.
Many political decisions have been built into the
test, as it was continually revised. For instance, in the

 

"Which is prettier”?

first Stanford-Binet revision (1916), girls scored lower
than boys; in the 1937 revision of the test, questions
were added and dropped so that the average middle
class girl would score as high as the average middle
class boy. Why was a similar adjustment not made
for non-white and lower class children? Somebody
must have decided (another political decision) that
their attitudes and values were not acceptable.

A major section of the Stanford-Binet test is the
vocabulary list, mostly learned words which a child
would rarely come across except by reading English
literature. Other questions are even more obvious
tests of background and attitude: "Which one is
prettier?" and "What’s the thing for you to do when
you have broken something that belongs to someone
else?” The correct answer must include an offer to
pay for it as well as an apo|o9Y»‘ "Feel sorry” and
"Tell ’em I did it” are wrong answers (Age 7-8,
Stanford-Binet, 1960).

Probably more important than the response to any
single question is the attitude of the child taking the
test. If the child dislikes school, rebels against his
teacher or is intimidated by tests he will score low, no
matter what his intelligence. Jane Mercer (1972)
describes how many black and Chicano children are
unjustly tracked into programs for the retarded on the
basis of L0. tests. For these reasons, the (.0. test is
no longer used as a basis for tracking children in
Philadelphia, New York City, Washington, D.C., Los
Angeles, and San Francisco.

Tne Genetics of L0. The claims that l.O.. is largely
inherited and scarcely modifiable by education and
social change are based primarily on two types of
comparisons between l.Q. scores: those of separated
twins and those involving adopted children. In the
twins’ case two individuals with identical genes are
brought up in different families: if their l.Q. scores are
very similar in most instances, it is concluded that a
change in the environment affects very little the |.Q.
score of any one. In the second case an individual
(having a given genetic set-up) is brought up in a
family which is not his own (therefore having a dif-
ferent genetic set-up): if his l.O. score, in spite of this,
is similar in most instances to that of his natural
mother, it is concluded that the genetic set-up is the
main factor in determining the I.O. of any one.
Jensen and Herrnstein, having reviewed and sum-
marized the results of several such studies (made by
others), draw the four propositions of the new eugen-
icists and state very definitely that no reasonable and
knowledgeable person may reach different conclu-
sions. In fact Kamin and Lewontin, to quote only two I
other scientists, state that on the basis of the same
data the heritability of I.Q. might well be zero.
There is no raw data available for the separated
twins studies of Sir Cecil Burt, studies upon which
much of Jensen's conclusions are based. So no one
can check hiswork. As Kamin shows, these studies
are filled with inconsistencies and in some cases
there are reasons to suspect that he may have mani-
pulated his scores (not available) to fit with his con-
clusions. In most studies, the LO. tests given were
not even standardized for age and sex. In addition,
the twins were placed, whenever possible, in very
similar environments, such as the homes of relatives
or next door-neighbors. Certainly not enough differ-
ence in their environment to justify the claim that
education and social change cannot change our I.Q.
The adopted children studies are equally biased.
Adoption agencies follow very strict procedures, like
matching the social condition and educational level
of the adoptive family with that of the natural mother.
Therefore the child may show a similar l.Q. score as
his natural mother's not because he has inherited it,
but rather because his mother's L0. is similar to that
of his adoptive family. Two such studies show that
the LO. scores of adopted children are different from
those of their adoptive families. A glaring observa-
tion, however, emerges from these studies and is
conveniently ignored by the new eugenicists. The

12

|.O. of the child is different from that of his adoptive
parents even when the head of this family is his natu-
ral father. Therefore the |.O. of the child is different in
such families from the l.O. of his father. A reasonable
explanation is that children conceived out of wed-
lock (whether or nottheir natural father is the head of
that family) are given in such families a differential
treatment. Nothing new, but nothing upon which to
base the claim that |.Q. is 80% inherited.

Why all this fuss? The four propositions of the new
eugenicists have generated an ongoing debate. Their
critics argue: first, that they give a rationale for racist
social policies; and second, that they are not scien-
tific. We have shown that there are incredible errors
and bias in the first two propositions, that l.O.
measures intelligence and that it is inherited. There
are also several misrepresentations of genetic theory
in the last two propositions. First of all, even though a
trait may be inherited, there is no reason to expect
this trait (|.Q.) not to change, if there is a sufficiently
large change in the environment (society). Secondly,
even though a trait may be highly inherited within
one group (middle class Americans and Europeans),
the same trait in a different group in a different
environment may not be (among poors or blacks).
And thirdly, there is no ground for stating that the
difference in a trait (|.Q.) between two groups
(blacks and whites) must be inherited and go on for
ever, even if it was true that the trait itself is inherited.
In any case, if the LO. score does not measure
intelligence and if it is not clear how much of what-
ever determines the LO. scores is inherited, to find
that non-white and lower class people score low
averages is not impressive any longer. Not any more
than to discover that Afro-Americans are generally
darker and for some reason they often have an
accent. Both the third proposition of the new eugeni-
cists and the final one, that education and social
change cannot affect the LO. score, appear much
less important as scientific statements than they are
as political decisions. One such decision has been not
to adjust the LO. test for different social classes,
different cultures and races the same way it was
adjusted, back in 1937, under the presidency of F.D.
Roosevelt, for white middle class boys and girls.
Another decision has been not to change the educa-
tional system and the economic and political struc-
ture of this society, so as to maintain a pretended
cultural superiority of the dominant classes.

BRAVE NEW WORLD?

Scientific progress is currently propagandized as a
major factor of civilization and increased human wel-
fare, even though its immediate practical benefits
may not be obvious. In the field of human repro-
duction, one possible long term goal is to relieve all
women from the biological burden of pregnancy and
child-birth. Another goal may be to liberate the
human race from the biological chance of genetic
defects. The supposed benefits to be expected from
such progress must be discussed openly and in
depth. If there are benefits, these must (1) not be
limited to a small group of individuals and (2) must
not be achieved at the expense of our present
personal freedom and sense of ourselves. Therefore,
the fulfillment of such goals would require not only
scientific and technological progress, but also tre-
mendous progress in our social relationships and
political institutions.

Eugenicists—o|d and new—go farther in two
respects. First, they want to create a "better” human
race, assuming that we know already in which direc-

tion we want to go. Second, they want to start doing
their things, without making sure that the technical
and social conditions for real progress are available to
all people. Many scientists take for granted—which is
always a rather unscientific attitude——that some
eugenic program, at least a limited one aimed to
eliminate our "bad" genes, is desirable. To many, the
urgency of such programs is reinforced by the pre-
sumed population crisis.
"In a world where each pair must be limited on
the average to two offspring and no more, the
right that must become paramount is not the
right to procreate, but rather the right of every
child to be born with a sound physical and men-
tal constitution, based on a sound genotype. No
parents in that future time will have a right to
burden society with a malformed or a mentally
incompetent child. . . .He must produce a Man
who can transcend his present nature."
(J. Fletcher, 1971)

The obstacles to the adoption of eugenic programs
are seen as mostly technical (more research is
needed) and sometimes as psychological (ignorant
and unreasonably fearful people must be convinced.)

EUC1El‘~uC$
Co2P. or-'

"But if these obstacles are overcome I wonder
whether such a eugenic program is not likely to
emerge, aimed primarily at reducing the produc-
tion of individuals whose genetic endowment
would limit their ability to cope with a techno-
logically complex environment. Would not such
a program then seem simply like a preventive
approach, supplementing the curative approach,
to the humanitarian goal of minimizing human
misery?” lB.Glass, 1971)

What is a genetic "defect"? Can a relative inability
to cope with one’s technological environment in a
given society, be considered as a defect that the
human race as a whole must be ridden of?

Some theologians and moral philosophers argue
that the sanctity of human life is attacked by genetic
engineers and the new eugenicists. They raise com-
plex legal questions concerning the ”right of the
unborn”. But they also ask straightfoward questions,
like the following. A

’'It is probably as indisputed as it is ignored that

the world suffers more from the morally and

spiritually defective than from the genetically
defective._ After all, how many architects of the

Vietnam War have suffered from Down’s syn-
drome?"* (L.R. Kass, 1973)

But the scientists who have chosen Brave New

World over the present one counterargue that "from

the point of view of genetics man is a barbarian”, so
there is only one remedy, to go forward (more of
the same?).

”C|oning or vegetative reproduction would per-
mit the preservation of the finest genotypes that
arise in our species—-just as the invention of
writing has enabled us to preserve the fruits of
their life's work.” ”But if one is seriously com-
mitted to human genetic improvement, then the
banks of artificial uteri (out of Brave New World)
appear in a different light." "A technology of
extrauterine gestation would certainly simplify
the problems of analysis and selection.” ”And
we have really only two choices—to proceed
with all the wisdom we can develop or to stag-
nate in fear and doubt. . . .The next step for evo-
lution is ours. We must devise that once again
on this sweet planet a fairer species will arise—a
being new and finer to expand the meaning of
life.’’ (B.D. Davis, 1970)

If it is a medical necessity to get rid of genetic
defects, why not get rid of low |.O. ,and other

14

 

undesirable characters? If it is socially desirable to
clone the finest individuals that arise naturally, then
why not to try to fabricate the kind of human beings
that they need, like obedient slaves to do their dirty
jobs?
’’It is entirely possible, given our present increas-
ing pollution of the human gene pool through
uncontrolled sexual reproduction, that we might
have to replicate healthy people to compensate
for the spread of genetic diseases and to elevate
the plus factors available in ordinary reproduc-
tion from unidentified cell sourcess. . 
‘’If the greatest good of the greatest numbers
(i.e., the social good) were served by it, it would
be justifiable not only to specialize the capacities
of people by cloning or by constructive genetic
engineering, but also to bio-engineer or bio-
design parahumans or ”modified” men——as
chimeras (part animal) or cyborg-androids (part-
prosthetes). I would vote for cloning top-grade
soldiers and scientists, or for supplying them
through other genetic means, if they were
needed to offset an elitist or tyrannical power
plot by other c|oners—a truly science-fictional
situation, but imaginable.” (P. Rampsey, 1970)

So much for genetic engineering and its supposed
benefits. it all starts with some limited and apparently

, reasonable plan, which sounds like just an amplifi-

cation of some current medical practice. Then it
seems as though the inner logic of their arguments
forces these new eugenicists into Brave New World.

These new eugenicists claim to be the most serious
champions of progress and civilization and then they

. try to sell us a new brand of human being. But

despite their futuristic images, their ideas of a human
being are the same old ones. According to them, our
chi|dren—the new superior race that shall populate
this planet—must be free from our ancestral defects
and possess some of our or our ancestors? best
qualities. Isn't this what all parents have always
wished for their children? Are eugenics and genetic
engineering really the best ways to achieve it? Are
they really talking of genetic defects and qualities?
One idea of theirs, in particular, from the old eugenic
movement, seems as firm as a rock: that social prob-
lems are the fault of imperfect individuals, not of the
social system. That social problems can and must be
cured like diseases. This Brave New World, despite all
its technological apparatus and science-fiction adver-
tisement, looks very old indeed.

WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN

Although many scientists openly support or are
ready to accept a government sponsored eugenic
policy, such policy is not likely to be enacted at the
present time in this country. Strong resistance might
be expected from the lower classes and the non-
white against any program aimed to control popula-
tion by limiting the number of their children. Such
resistance could threaten also the funding of the
limited indirect eugenic programs (screening and
counselling) which are already under way and of
other developments of the biological revolution (see
below). .‘

We might expect the first moves toward a
genetically controlled society to be rather subtle. For
example, every day, in hospitals around the country,
decisions are being made about the genetic worth of
prospective human beings. As amniocentesis is
available, some parents have the opportunity to
choose whether or not to abort a fetus with a genetic

”defect.” Clearly, this technique will save many-

parents from grief.

As the number of disorders that can be diagnosed
by amniocentesis increases, more and more fetuses
will be aborted on the basis of a particular doctor's
and particular parent's judgements. Where do these
judgements come from? They will undoubtedly
reflect the dominant medical attitudes of the time and
the attitudes of the dominant classes of society. (It
won't be the lower classes who are writing in the
medical journals and publishing the information for
genetic counselling.) From recommending abortion
for clearly defined defects (like Down’s syndrome)
they might move to hazier ones (like schizophrenia)
and finally to low IO.

Since these judgements about the genetic worth of
the fetus will primarily be "individual” decisions, the
"society at large” will not have a chance to take part

16

in the decision. There will be no public debate about
the whole issue. Nevertheless, the sum of these indi-
vidual decisions will form new social values about the
genetic worth of people. Since each new technique is
likely to be heralded as an important new medical
advance for the benefit of mankind, there will be little
reason to criticize the whole trend. The change will
be gradual. The new social values may never be put
into law, but they will allow newer and more powerful
eugenic techniques.

While the public will be led gradually to accept
anything the new technologies may have to offer, the
eugenicists will keep up the pressure. They will
remind discontented workers that they could be re-
placed by semi-human cooperative morons. They will
urge that welfare mothers be sterilized and perhaps
be used for a salary to bear and deliver the babies of
the upper classes. Or they will promise the war-

mongers the "perfect” ethnic weapon: like viruses or

chemicals capable of attacking only non-white people
(Larson, 1970). Technical advances will allow more
control, more precision and more efficiency in doing
more of the same things. Which things should be
done and for what purpose, will never be discussed,
except in small circles of scientific and political
experts. So far those experts are the same persons
who have been making the decisions that affect
everybody’s life.

BLAMING THE VICTIMS.

In the last 10 or 15 years there has been an
increasing outcry against the inequalities of our politi-
cal-economic system. From civil rights marches to
ghetto uprisings to welfare protests and Indian
occupations, more and more of the poor and op-

pressed have raised demands for a fairer distribution
of goods and power in our society. Half-way
measures taken’ by the government to correct these
inequalities have been unsuccessful;

Meanwhile, in the last five years, there has been an
increase in government funding for studies which
show that individual "problems” are the cause of
social problems. Not surprisingly, there has been an
increasing number of scientists who have begun to
explain away our problems as the fault of biological
or genetic defects in individuals or classes of people.
For example, Doctors Vernon Mark and William
Sweet work with the Neuro-Research Foundation,
which has as its purpose, "the diagnosis and treat-
ment of persons with poor control of dangerous im-
pulses.” After the 1967 Detroit rebellions, the two
doctors wrote a letter to the Journal of the American
Medical Association which said the rioters were the
kind of people who are unable "to resist the tempta-
tions of unrestrained violence.” Their idea is to treat
such people ”with a low threshhold for impulsive
violence” by operating on their brains (psychosur-
gery). Their approach hs been funded with $100,000
by the U.S. Justice Department.

Of course, it cannot be denied that there are social
and economic causes for violence:

 . .nonetheless, of all those millions afflicted

with poverty, social hatred and urban stagna-

tion, only a few behave violently towards their

fellow man. . . .ls it not entirely reasonable to

assume that such patients are suffering attacks

of a form of epilepsy." (Maletzky, 1973)
And some physicians, like Dr. Maletzky, go on to pro-
pose a drug treatment to alleviate the symptoms of
the ”violent few”. And they too, may get money to
fund their research.

Suppose hunger became so intolerable in some
region striken by famine, that a few individuals
started eating their fellows. Would the solution con-
sist in finding a treatment for "cannibalistic tenden-
cies” and using it with those few "cannibals”? There
are many scientists now studying violence. But what
is violence? Does it include those who make wars?
Those who are responsible‘ for social inequalities? In
our society a significant fraction of the population
suffers from malnutrition, poor health, poor housing,
poor schooling, and low-paying jobs. Many others
find they have little control over their own lives. Is it
reasonable to classify those who refuse to accept all
that as biologically deviant? Or is it reasonable to re-
structure society so that ”deviance” and ’’violence’’
are no longer produced?

Despite the obvious and legitimate causes of social
unrest, the studies which blame the victim continue
to be funded,’continue to be produced, and continue
to support public policy. Some of the studies claim
that major classes of people are genetically incom-
petent for survival in this society. Others claim that
violence coming from the poorer classes is due to
brain defects or genetic abnormalities. Their common
assumption is that the social order is innocent, that
individuals and classes of people are to blame. This is
the same assumption behind eugenics, making
”better” people. If people are the problem, then
selective breeding, test tube babies, and cloning
become reasonable tools for ”social progress."

 

THE BIOLOGICAL REVOLUTION.

Genetics was not used by old eugenicists to dress
up their theories in scientific terms as much as psy-
chology, anthropology and medicine only because
genetics as a science is very recent. Although the
concept of heredity has been crucial to support a
view of the world based on the superiority of the
white upper class man, until 30 years ago very little
was known of the nature and function of the heredi-
tary material itself. The biological revolution which
started after World War ll brought genetics into the
foreground. Reducing complex biological events to
their simpler components and explaining them in
physical and chemical terms has been from the
‘beginning the program of molecular biology, a disci-
pline companion to genetics.

in the last 30 years we have discovered the struc-
ture of the genetic substance, DNA (the double helix
of Watson and Crick, of which genes are made), how
to achieve its perfect replication in viruses and how
this substance codes for other substances in all the
cells of each living organism. We have learned to fuse
together cells of the most diverse vertebrate species

 

and how to transplant the nucleus from one cell into
another, as well as the general strategy for trans-
planting organs from one animal into another. We
have learned how to induce egg-cells to start multi-
plying, how to transplant them and how to keep an
embryo growing for some time outside the body. We
have discovered hormonal contraceptives and the
principle for designing such contraceptives for both
sexes. We have discovered many psychoactive
drugs, which reproduce the symptoms of many
diseases and so we are learning to modify at will our
mood and our behavior both by taking these drugs
and by electrical stimulation of the brain.

Molecular biologists tell us what they can do and
what they plan doing and then they generally stop
there. If pressed, most will agree that their work can
be used for good or evil, but they believe that the
balance is for good.

But at the same time, just as molecular biology
attempts to explain life as physics and chemistry, the
trend is to go on to attempt to explain society and
history as life. Many popular books—written by bio-
logists in most cases—have recently portrayed the
biological evolution of the human race as one thing
with its cultural evolution. (On Aggression by Konrad
Lorenz, The Naked Ape by Desmond Morris and The
Descent of Woman by Elaine Morgan, are only a few
examples.) All these books stress the fact that "man”
is an animal and set up to explain all the major prob-
lems in our society by the legacy of our animal
instincts. What is generally forgotten is that we are
dealing with a special kind of animal and what is
special is precisely that the key factor in human evo-
lution has been liberation from direct biological
control through culture. Culture is the knowlege and
the experience which is transmitted from one genera-
tion. to the next. At the beginning of history it was
probably passed by word of mouth through indivi-
duals within the family, whereas later it has become
more and more a social enterprise through schools,
literature and the media. If culture is artificially
scratched from the picture, then biology is all that
remains. Biology is destiny, according to these
writers, because we cannot change the laws of
physics, chemistry and genetics.

19

In this way, while molecular biologists provide the
new ”scientific” world view, they also lend their
authority, directly or indirectly, to the old eugenic
dream. Here is how Nobel prize winner Salvador
Luria reminds us of the vision of the future of another
pioneer geneticist, Herman Muller (the first propo-
nent of sperm banks):

"Mul|er held forth to mankind the vision of a

happier future: a future in which man, experi-

menting with himself and his progeny in an
enlightened spirit of scientific inquiry and social
justice, would by choice create better, more
cooperative and more rational generations of

man-" ' (Luria, 1970)
Many molecular biologists share this vision, although
they may not share Muller's unshakable optimism,
conscious as they are of the past misuses and abuses
of science. They only endorse the program with
cautious and limited faith, unlike their colleagues who
believe in Brave New World. But perhaps the bio-
logical revolutionaries have something in common.
They dismiss our social problems and their social
causes and they disregard the role of science as part
of the problem. Perhaps we cannot change the world
with this biological revolution.

THE SOCIAL ROLE OF SCIENCE.

What is a revolution? According to Harvard his-
torian Donald Fleming:

"Every full-scale revolution has three main com-

ponents: a distinctive attitude toward the world;

a program for utterly transforming it; and an un- '

shakable, not to say fanatical, confidence that

this program can be enacted —a world view a

program and a faith.” . (Fleming, 1969)

The achievements of the biological revolution in
the last twenty years have opened up new possi-
bilities to modify our own genes, our reproduction
and our behavior. These possibilities affect our own
conception of our bodies and our selves and there-
fore may change our way of thinking and our lives.
Together with other technical and scientific advances
following World War ll, the advances in molecular
biology provide more power for changing the world.
How this power is going to be used depends first, on
which social goals are agreed upon (what do we
want) and, secondly, on who controls science and
technology to achieve those goals.

ln the U.S. over half of all government research
and development is paid for by the military and most
of the non-military research is paid for by large cor-
porations. The obvious goals—from the point of view
of those who control society—are to increase and
protect private profit, to monopolize the markets and
to maintain peace at the workplace. Those who make
the decisions on which goals are to be achieved are
the same group that controls the funding of science
and technology.

Science is not done in a vacuum, separate from the
rest of the world. How scientific achievements get
used depends on the social and political environment.
The structure of society also determines what kind of
scientific work gets done. One of the best known
examples of this is the development of the atomic
bomb. Under the pressure of World War II, the U.S.
instituted a huge crash-program, the Manhattan Pro-

"ject, to apply the most advanced theories of physics

to making the bomb. The same sort of thing hap-
pened during the Vietnam War to develop sensing
devices. Wars are not the only time this happens.
Many innovations in industry have appeared
following a strike—to make the companies less
dependent on labor. Recently, farmworker strikes

20

have led Iu the development of new plant breeds and
picking machines. Recently students’ unrest, ghetto
rebellions and the antiwar movement have brought
the attention of the public and of the experts on vio-
lence. New devices have been developed for con-
trolling dissent at home and for fighting a war abroad,
which the American people have neither wanted nor
declared.

We have examined the world view of the biological
revolutionaries, the program of the eugenicists, the
faith of the genetic engineers. We have come to the
conclusion that their Brave New World is just a
projection of the prejudices, the fears and the greed
for power of the dominant classes in this society.
Science can do much both to justify the policies and
the beliefs of some small powerful minority and to
satisfy their needs, to cure their diseases and to fight
their wars. However, science cannot replace the will
of the people. The Vietnam war has demonstrated
that U.S. technology by itself could not conquer a
small peasant country.

The Vietnamese people, instead, while resisting the
French and the American invaders, have also suc-
ceeded in transforming their society by using modern
science and technology. When the people in this
country decide that they want justice, freedom and
happiness for all, science can then become a
powerful tool in their hands to change the world.

CLASSROOM SUGGESTIONS

1. Contact a hospital in ‘your area to find out about
genetic counselling. For what diseases are screening
and counselling available? How we||—defined are the
diseases? How extensive is the counselling? Are
several views presented? How expensive are the
various tests and the counselling?

2. Are there any circumstances, imagining any kind
of ideal society, where the genetic technologies or
some of them would not be misused?

3. What are some examples of social control? What
methods of control are used where you or your
parents work? Are all of them necessary? Why do
they exist? Could genetic engineering be used for
social control?

4. In some places organizations like the Medical
Committee for Human Rights and prison reform
groups have started campaigns against practices like
psychosurgery and behavior modification. What is
going on in your area in terms of these experiments
on people? What in terms of reforms? What do you
think of it?

21

5. What can be done to make sure that scientific
research give priority to problems which concern a
large number of people? That technical advances (for
example, in medicinelare available to everybody?
That the people decide what is to be done?

6. Are LO. tests given in your present school? Have
they been given to you previously? How are the
results used? Do you know anybody who has been
sent to a special school as a result of an |.Q. test?
(talk to counsellors and teachers)

7. The Chicago Bar Association has introduced in
1973 a bill before the Illinois legislature. The bill would
provide that the State Public Health Director issue a
marriage license, only "after he has determined that
such marriage may be consummated without serious
danger to the health of either party to the proposed
marriage or to any issue (i.e. children) of such mar-
riage." Is it proper that the state determine whether
or not people can live together? Do you think that the
purpose for marriage is essentially to have children?
For this purpose, could one consider artificial insem-
ination or some other alternative? Could one consi-
der adoption?

 

 

GLOSSARY

A. SOCIAL CONCEPTS

Caste System—A,social system in which people are
born into clearly defined groups which they stay in
their whole lives. People are considered superior or
inferior according to which caste they are in.

Conditioning—A process in which an individual is
trained to react in certain ways and not in other
ways by rewarding the way she or he is being
trained to act, and punishing her or him when she
or he acts another way.

Deviant—An individual who is different from what is
considered "usual” or “normal”. Often used to
mean there is something wrong with the individual
for being different.

Hereditarian——ln the argument about whether peo-
p|e’s behavior and mental make—up can be ex-
plained by inherited traits, or by the influence of
the environment, those thinking inheritance is the
only or the most important factor are called
hereditarians.

Patent— If a person invents a new product or process
he can buy a patent or guarantee from the govern-
ment that nobody else can make or sell his idea
without his permission.

B. REPRODUCTION (see also chapter on cloning)

Embryo-—A newly formed organism in its first stages
of growth. In mammals these stages include the
multiplication and differentiation of the fertilized
egg—cel| after it is implanted, until blood circula-
tion is established between the new organism (by
now a few million cells) and the maternal body.

Fallopian Tubes——The tubes COHHGCIIDQ tne ovaries
to the uterus. Eggs are produced in the ovaries,
move into the fallopian tubes where they may be
fertilized, and then after fertilization, go to the
uterus, where they develop into an embryo.

Fetus—The embryo after it has grown for two
months in the uterus. At this time the blood cir-
culation between mother and fetus is established
and the general design (anatomy) of the future
baby is formed.

/mp/antation—The attachment of the fertilized egg-
cell to the inner wall of the mother's uterus. This is
the beginning of pregnancy.

In Vitro—Something happening outside the body, in
a lab (such as an experiment in which cells from

an animal are grown in a test tube). The word _

means literally ”in glass”. If cells are studied right
in the organism, they are studied ”in vivo”, or
"in life’’. . T

Mamma/—A class of animals including people, cats,
dogs, rabbits, deer, etc. Characteristics include
having babies develop in a uterus inside the
mother, breasts for feeding babies, warm body
temperature, 8 other traits.

Ovaries—The female reproductive organ, where eggs
are produced.

Ovu/ation—The’ movement of the mature egg-cell
in the female from the ovary to the ‘uterus. During
this period the egg-cell can be fertilized by sperm
and then become implanted. ’

P/acenta—The organ, similar to plant roots, by which
the fetus is attached to the uterus and draws blood
with oxygen and nutrients from the maternal body.

Steri/ization-— Making someone sterile, or unable to
have children. Usually done in women by removing
the ovaries surgically or tying the fallopian tubes,
and in men (a much simpler operation) by tying
the channels which connect the testis (where the
sperm is produced) to the penis.

Uterus—The organ in women in which the fertilized
egg grows into an embryo and then a fetus.

C. GENES AND HEREDITY

Dip/oid——A diploid cell contains pairs of chromo-
somes. Each pair contains one set of chromosomes
from the mother and one from the father. The
word means "doub|e”. (see "haploid")

Down’s Syndrome——This disease used to be called
”Mongoloidism”, because those who suffer from it
' (all races) look like the caricature of a Mongol child.
It is due to the presence of an extra-chromosome:
like the XYY syndrome (see section on genetic
counselling), but a different extra chromosome.
The patients are frequently ill with all sorts of infec-
tions, they often get leukemia and they are physi-
cally and mentally retarded. They usually die before
thirty.

Galactosemia—A one gene—defect. The patient from
birth cannot utilize mi|k—sugar, so that food con-
taining this substance is poisonous. If babies with
this disease are recognized at birth or before, they
may grow normally with a milk-free diet.

Gene Poo/—A|l the genes of all the individuals in a
population; A concept used when talking about
how a given gene is spread in a population,
rather than about the genes of a single individual.

Genotype—The genotype of an individual is all the
genes he or she has. It is different from ”pheno-
type” which refers to the traits the individual has.
Not all genes in the genotype are expressed as
traits.

Hap/oid—A haploid cell has only one member of each
chromosome pair from the mother and father. The
word means ”half”. (see "dip|oid")

Mango/oid— See Down’s Syndrome.

Schizophrenia—A mental disease which can be very
severe or not. There are many causes which con-
cur in producing the disease. Some of them are in-
herited, because of some defective gene or genes.

In general terms, experiments on the physiology of

INTRODUCTION

Recent developments in genetics have opened up
a number of new possibilities: eliminating genetic
diseases, test-tube babies, armies of look—alike sol-
diers, and "improving” human beings.

Some of the developments benefit many people.
Some benefit a few people, but could benefit many.
Others could have harmful effects on some classes or
on the whole society. A

The same di|emma—benefits vs. dangers—is
found in many other scientific areas. People are
asking: is science good or bad? Who gains and who
loses from scientific progress? Should scientists be
held responsible for how their work is used? Should
science be democratically controlled? For this reason

The genetic

Aldous Huxley’s book, Brave New World, has been
shocking people for forty years. It describes a futur-
istic society where the people are conditioned* for
social control from the time they are conceived. The
"conditioners” of Brave New World used three basic
forms of genetic te'chno|ogy—contro//ed breeding,
cloning, and manipulation of the embryos*—to
control the development of the fetuses. Many of the
same technologies are currently well along in their
development.

CLONING

The Genetics of Reproduction. Each animal species is
characterized by a given number and type of
chromosomes. Each chromosome carries many
genes, which are made of DNA. There are slight
differences in genes among individuals, which make
them all different. All the genes in any given indi-
vidual derive from one cell: the fertilized egg. Fertili-
zation is avprocess in which one sperm cell (from an
adult male), carrying half the number of chromo-

the study of what is happening in genetics is a good
introduction to the issues of science and society.

It is necessary to read the beginning of the booklet
first, in order to understand the later parts. Starred
words are in the glossary at the back.

A few words about our bias. We don't mean ‘this
booklet to be an attack on science. In fact, many of
the people who wrote it are practicing scientists. But
we are concerned about how science is used, why it

is used as it is, and what we can all do about it. We _

don't have all the answers to these questions, but we
see that we have to find some answers if we are to
exercise control over our own lives.

technologies

somes needed (haploid) merge with one egg cell
(from an adult female), carrying the other half. The
result is one cell, which carries the regular number of
chromosomes (diploid) and begins to divide. Before
the cell divides, all the chromosomes duplicate and
divide, so that each cell receives the same chromo-
somes and therefore the same identical genes.

At each division, the number of diploid cells in the
new organism (embryo) doubles (one; two; four;
eight; sixteen; etc). At first all these cells look alike,
then they start to differentiate, that is, they assume
the different sizes, shapes and functions which are
required in‘ the different parts of the new body. One
of these parts is the sex organ: ovaries or testicles.
Sex cells (egg or sperm cells) when they mature loose
half of their chromosomes and so they are ready for a
new process of fertilization.

An adult human being has many billions of body
cells, all genetically identical, except for the sex cells.

. A female has a few hundred large egg cells; a male at

each ejaculation produces and releases several
millions of small sperm cells. Each mature sex cell is

 

 

 

genetically different from each other, as a result of
loosing different chromosomes or part of them. Thus
each new organism which is born naturally from
fertilization (the merging of one sperm and one egg
cell) is genetically unique, although it derives half of
its genes from its father and the other half from its
mother. The new combination is unique, like a new
song made up with a number of old words and notes.
Cloning is a process by which this diversity can be
eliminated, by transplanting the nucleus (where the
chromosomes are) of a body cell into an egg cell,
from which its own nucleus has been removed. In
this way a new organism can be produced, which will
be genetically identical to the donor of that one
nucleus. Theoretically, it is possible to produce
billions of individuals identical to each other like
carbon copies (like identical twins, which are
naturally born from the same fertilized egg).

Making Carbon Copies of individuals The condi-
tioners of Brave New World cloned large numbers of
identical individuals to perform specialized functions.
This was one of their ”Major instruments for main-
taining social stability”. To many people, cloning is
perhaps the most frightening prospect of genetic
engineering, since its misapplications in a totalitarian
society are easily imagined. At the same time, most
people (including many scientists) relegate talk of
cloning people to mere science fiction fantasy, or
disregard the matter completely as being irrelevant.
For example, Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel prize win-
ning geneticist, states simply:
There is no urgent social problem to be ad-
dressed by such a technique. . .. Cloning a man

is one of the least important questions l can
think of. (Lederberg, 1970)

And yet, achieving human cloning is likely to be one
of the most simple forms of genetic technology.

Cloning has already been carried out with at least
one species of animal, the frog. (Edwards and Fowler,
1970) The technique is straight—forward. Unfertilized
frog eggs are collected and by delicate surgery the
nucleus* is removed and replaced by the nucleus
obtained from a body cell of an adult frog. Intro-
duction of the body cell nucleus apparently
stimulates the egg as if it had been fertilized by a
sperm, and the egg with the transplanted nucleus
matures into a frog identical to the donor frog. Since
the donor frog is composed of millions of cells, it is
possible, at least in theory, that any particular frog
could be the ”parent" ofliterally millions of cloned
replicas of itse|f—and each of these replicas could, in
turn, serve as parents for millions of additional
replicas etc.

Why clone a frog? In the field of animal develop-
ment, the cloning experiment was central in the proof
that each body cell retains all of the genetic infor-
mation originally found in the sex cells. But once this
fact has been established in frogs, why is it necessary
to repeat the experiment in mammals*, which is
considerably more difficult? In particular, why is the
specialized technology required for human cloning
being developed? L

There are basically two reasons why the tech-
niques for human cloning are being studied——to
increase the knowledge of how fetuses* grow and for
use in medicine to treat infertility and genetic
diseases. There is certainly a lot that could be learned
by studying human fetal growth outside the mother.
But most embryologists, like other scientists, prefer
not to think about the impact their research might

have on society, about how it will probably be used.
They prefer to concentrate on their science, including
”test-tube babies,” and leave the moral and political
decisions to someone else. According to Joshua
Lederberg, the ". . .scientific community should
impose criteria of scientific validity for funding or
dissociate itself from responsibility when it does not
have the authority to make the critical decisions.”
(Lederberg, 1970)

Test-tube babies. Outside of the pursuit for "pure"
knowledge, the techniques for cloning are being
developed bit by bit for medical uses. For example,
Edwards and Steptoe have perfected techniques to
allow women with blocked fallopian tubes* to have
babies. The techniques involve removing mature
eggs from the ovaries* just prior to ovulation (in an
operation called laparoscopy), fertilizing the eggs in a
test tube, growing the fertilized egg until the cells
differentiate (blastocyst stage), and finally, im-
planting the embryo in the uterus*. The entire
operation has been carried out successfully with mice
and the first three steps with human eggs. The result
of an attempt to implant a human embryo has not
been reported yet. The embryo could be implanted in
the original mother, in another woman, or in an arti-
ficial placenta (when one is developed).

In addition to the work of Edwards and Steptoe,
methods have recently been perfected to remove the
nucleus from mammalian* cells (Ladda and Estensen,
1970), and the same method will probably work on
egg cells as well. Therefore, probably the major
difficulty which remains before human cloning is
feasible, is the introduction of a body cell nucleus._

Even this difficulty may be short-lived since efficient
methods have been known for some time for fusing
mammalian cells to form a hybrid which contains the
genetic information of both parent cells. (Ephrussi
and Weiss, 1969) This method could probably be
extended and used to fuse enucleated egg cells and
adult body cells.

In any case, the rapid advances in mammalian cell
biology in recent years and the increasing amount of
research in experimental embryology probably means
that the first clonal mammal will be ”born” sometime
in the not too distant future. Whether the technique
is extended to humans depends on many fac-
tors—medica|, social, legal and political. However, if
the current scientific attitude of "what can be done,
should be done" prevails, the cloning of a human
being is very likely. The following statement by J.D.
Watson (developer of a model for DNA) probably
represents the sentiments of many in the field: i

”We must, therefore, assume thattechniques

for the in vitro manipulation of human eggs are

likely to be general practice, capable of routine
performance in many major countries, within
some ten to twenty years.” ”Thus, if the matter

proceeds in its currenfnondirected fashion, a

human being born of clonal reproduction most

likely will appear on the earth within the next
twenty to fifty years, and even sooner, if some

nation actively promotes the venture.” (Watson,
1971)

But what should be done?

1. Who will decide what kinds of individuals will be
cloned? What are the potential. dangers of producing
a caste* system based on one’s predetermined
genetic makeup?

 

2.; ls it desirable to limit the genetic diversity among
the population? Would this make the human race less
adaptable?

3. Do the scientific reasons for developing cloning
outweigh the potential misuse of the cloning tech-
niques? Do you think the possible misapplication of
cloning techniques is considered by the people either
doing or funding the research?

4. What form, if any, should opposition to cloning
take: letters? legislation? demonstrations? banning all
cloning experiments?

5. What are the reasons for pursuing the goal of test
tube fertilization? ls it to spare women the problems
of childbearing: the risks, discomforts, inability to
pursue a career? What are the benefits a researcher
himself expects to derive from such experiments?

6. Consider that a woman donating eggs for fertili-
zation might not actually carry the child after im-
plantation. Who might the replacement mother be?
7. One justification that Edwards gives for his ex-
periments is that infertile women will be able to have
their own (biological) children. Is it society's duty to
guarantee every human being the possibility of
procreation?

 

DESIGNED GENETIC CHAl\lGE

Another means of manipulating the human gene
pool which is developing rapidly but which was not
predicted in Brave New World, is the changing of
genetic constitution by introducing a different gene
or set of genes into human cells. Most of the interest
in these techniques has focused on the possibility of
repairing genetic "defects” by bringing in a "good”
copy of the gene in question, preferably at some very
early stage of development. The main efforts in this
area have been attempts to introduce into the cells
new genes carried as part of the genetic material of a
virus. There is one report of the successful con-
version of the genes of a cell using a bacterial virus,
but these experiments have so far not been con-
vincingly confirmed. (Merril et. al., 1971) in another
case, a virus was found to carry a gene for an enzyme
normally present in animal cells (thymidine kinase).
When the virus was introduced into cells defective
for this gene, the cells were ”cured” of their defect.
(Munyon et al, 1971) Various combinations of the
techniques of molecular biology and virology are
being explored which may broaden the possibilities.

There are many problems to be solved, however,
before it will be possible to use these techniques. Can
the genes be introduced into the cells where they are
needed? Will they function inside those cells? Will the
incorporation of the virus which carries those genes
be harmful? Despite the fact that we don't know the
answer to those questions, this is one of the most
actively explored areas in the general field of genetic
engineering. Why? First, research in this field is cer-
tainly going to advance our knowledge of human
genes. Second, the prospects for its application are
much more specific and refined than cloning, since it
is conceivable to replace only one defective ‘gene.

This technique has been called gene therapy. Its
scope is very limited, precisely because of its great
specificity. Only one gene-defects (like galactose-
mia*), may be curable, after the technical problems
are solved, not defects involving several genes, like
diabetes. In addition, the ”good” gene is likely to be
introduced only into part of the cells of the body. Will
then the whole body be healthy? Despite the techni-
cal problems, the uncertain hazards and the limita-
tions, gene therapy has been saluted as a new real
medical possibility. This is likely to mislead the public
and generate frustration and reaction.

GENETIC SCREENING AND COUNSELLING

”Defective” genes can either be replaced by
designed genetic change (described in the last
section), or they can be removed from the human
gene pool by selective breeding. For selective
breeding, parents with ”defective” genes are
encouraged, enticed, or legally required not to have
children. An approach to determining who should
and who should not breed is provided by genetic
screening and counselling, which are becoming more
widespread in this country.

As we begin to understand the basis of more and
more of the genetic diseases, it becomes possible to
screen potential parents for the probability of their
having kids with any of these diseases. In many
states mandatory screening laws have been passed.
For instance, in Massachusetts, a sickle cell trait
screening law has been passed which requires that
the Commissioner of Health require such screening in
school children of "a population at risk". (Friedmann,
1971) As a result of such screening and counseling,
parents may make the decision as to whether they
wish to take the chance of having a diseased child.

Amniocentesis and Abortion. The procedure of
amniocentesis, in which a doctor examines the genes
of a fetus* at a relatively early stage of pregnancy,
provides a new tool for genetic screening. (Danielli,
1972) Amniocentesis is done by withdrawing
amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus, usually at
around 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy, examining the
cells obtained either biochemically or by chromo-
some* analysis, and determining whether a potential
defect exists. This technique can be used, for
example, to detect a mongo|oid* fetus in older
mothers. Already, 60 or more diseases or ”defects”
can be detected in this way. The parents may then
choose to abort the fetus. This is becoming more and
more of a common occurrence. Thus, parents, rather
than having to choose between no children and the
risk of bearing a diseased child, may have as many
”normal” children as they want and abort the
’’abnormal’’ fetuses.

The XYY male. Not all cases are as clear cut as
having a mongoloid baby or not. Some males are
born with the unusual property of having an extra Y

chromosome. As a result of studies in mental and
penal institutions over the last several years, a
number of researchers have publicly proclaimed that
XYY males were aggressive and had a high tendency
towards socially deviant* behavior. (Hook, 1973)
Proposals were immediately forthcoming in some

countries that XYY males be registered. Bentley E

Glass, president of the National Academy of Science,
anticipated with enthusiasm the day when a
combination of amniocentesis and abortion will ”rid
us. . .of sex deviants such as the XYY type.” (Glass,
1971)

There are many criticisms of the studies of XYY
males. One is‘ that the studies took place in insti-
tutions specifically selected for deviant behavior,
instead of in the population at large. Still more dis-
turbing is the question of who is defining ”deviant”
behavior. And even if it were established beyond the
shadow of a doubt that XYY males tend to have
"deviant” behavior, who is going to make the
decision about what is deviant enough to be deprived
of life? If eugenic legislation compelling abortion in
some cases is adopted, then it will be hard to draw
the line on aborting many other kinds of genetic

: "defects.”

The XYY male debate is part of a much larger
debate about the origins of "antisocial” behavior.
Recently some scientists have been trying to show
that the cause of antisocial behavior is in individuals.
The proposed explanations include genetic de-
ficiencies, brain damage, epilepsy, and low ”intel-
ligence.” These scientists say that antisocial behavior
can be cured by treating individuals (by psycho-
surgery, for example), rather than by making social
and economic changes. Much of their work is funded
by the U.S. Justice Department, whose research
budget rose 400% from 1970 to 1972. People on the
other side of the debate claim that social and eco-
nomic conditions are to blame and that those who
blame individuals are defending an unjust social

system.

Sickle-cell anemia. Sickle-cell anemia is a potentially
serious inherited disease that mainly hits people
originally from North and Central Africa. The disease
usually appears by the age of six or seven and is often
fatal. Its seriousness is affected by factors such as
malnutrition and generally poor living conditions. It
has received a lot of publicity in the last few years,

but with little notice many states have passed
screening laws for it. These screening laws have
brought out many of the difficulties and dangers of
genetic legislation.

Several of the laws are based on faulty in-
formation, calling the disease ”contagious” or not
distinguishing between sickle-cell trait and the
disease itself. People who carry the trait have only
one sickle-cell gene. They, can pass the gene on to
their children, but they themselves lead normal,
healthy lives. Sickle-cell anemia, the disease, is
caused by inheriting two sickle-cell genes, one from
each parent. Some laws require sickle-cell testing of
new-born babies (when it is too soon to tell) or first
graders (after the disease has already appeared).

The largest group of sickle-cell screening laws
require testing before marriage. A number of blacks
consider the laws discriminatory—and to the extent
that they discourage blacks from having children,
threatening to the whole black race. After all, there
are no laws covering any of the other ethnic diseases.
And perhaps totally eliminating the sickle-cell gene
by selective breeding is not such a good idea. Sickle-

__cell trait is known to provide protection from malaria.

Of course, we have ways of treating malaria, and
none exists for sickle-cell anemia. But the point is
that a genetic condition can have several effects, and
we risk throwing out the good ones when we elimi-
nate the bad.

Many of the difficulties surrounding sickle-cell
come from the confusion between the trait and the
disease. There have been reported cases of job dis-
crimination against people with the trait, and some
insurance companies will not give normal life
insurance. Also, people carrying the trait can be really
scared if they think they have the disease.

The only cure to the confusion is widespread, de-
tailed, repeated, and objective counselling. But this
costs alot of money-—much more than just the
testing. So right now there is very little counselling
going on. Without the necessary counselling the
genetic screening may cause more problems than it
solves.

What should be done?

1. In genetic counselling, what influence does the
physician have over the patient’s decision? How far
should the counselling go?

2. What is normal and "antisocial” and who defines
it? How does the dominant sector of society in-
fluence that definition?

3. What are the risks of amniocentesis in our society?
How can we balance the risks against the benefits of
eliminating well-defined genetic diseases?

4. What are the evolutionary implications of amnio-
centesis and abortion? ls there a genetic basis for
social disorders?

5. The XYY gene combination results in certain
characteristics (like tallness and severe acne) which
could, in a particular social setting, make it more
difficult for the individual to avoid ”antisocial"
behavior. Explain.

6. E.B. Hook describes an example of a mother who
chose to abort an XYY fetus afteramniocentesis. She
did this after being "told of what little was known of
the prognosis at the time.” Obviously the doctor gave
her the information. What information did the doctor
have and where did he get it? Is this a good way for
such decisions to be made?

7. In Boston amniocentesis costs between $300 and
$400. What does it cost in your town? Is it available to
all segments of society?

Eugenics

A BYGONE ERA?

A widespread application of cloning and gene
therapy to human beings may appear frightening but
not very likely to happen soon. More "reasonable”
and '’sensible’’ approaches to manipulate the human
gene pool—|ike genetic screening and counselling-
are readily available and have been used in the past
more drastically than they are now. What is the justi-
fication for such manipulation?

Eugenics is a theory which maintains the necessity
of improving physically and mentally the human race
by controlling human reproduction. Eugenics in the
past has tried to intervene in this natural process in
"two major ways: (1) by eliminating the ”bad” genes
from the human gene pool* (this means sterilization*
of certain individuals, laws restricting marriage and
procreation, genetic screening and counselling); (2) by
propagating the ”good” genes (this means forcing or
enticing certain individuals to marry and procreate).
The second part of the eugenic program has-always
appeared more repugnant and has been seldom
implemented, exept in Nazi Germany. The develop-
ment of the new genetic technology, however, could
bypass some of the crudest aspects of suchaprogram,
by manipulating sperm and egg cells in the labora-
tory, without tramping on the individual freedom of
their donors.

Few people realize how influential and widespread
the eugenics movement was between the end of last
century and the thirties, in this ‘country and
elsewhere. By 1931 the eugenics movement had con-
vinced some thirty states to pass laws for the sterili-
zation of criminals, prostitutes, the insane, and the
feebleminded. Although the laws were seldom
enforced, at least 60,000 people were sterilized for
reasons such as ”feeblemindedness” and epilepsy in
the three decades prior to World War II.

Although appearing high-minded and scientific,
the eugenics movement developed what we would
now consider a racist outlook. In response to the vio-
lent struggle to organize unions—led primarily by

immigrant workers—industria| leaders such as
Carnegie, Kellogg, and Harriman established the
Carnegie lnstitution for Experimental Evolution, The
Race Betterment Foundation, and the Eugenics
Records Office.

This eugenics movement used scores from l.O.
tests (see the section on L0.) given to lmmigrants as a
basis for the quotas in the highly restrictive immigra-
tion laws passed by Congress in the 1920's. (Kamin,
1973) These laws were constructed to keep out the
"inferior” races: the Jews, the Irish, and Southern
and Eastern Europeans. Similarly the eugenics move-
ment was behind the state laws (also in the 1920's)
prohibiting certain races from marrying whites.

The scientific establishment of the time gave
support to the eugenics movement, as is described
by Mark Haller in his book, Eugenics (1963):

’’In this enlightened day, it is perhaps well to
reflect upon the scientific reception accorded
Madison Grant's publication of The Passing of
the Great Race in 1916. This pro-Nordic and
viciously anti-Semetic book, the height of elitist
racism, was on the whole received respectfully
in the scientific community. The magazine
Science called the book a ‘work of solid merit’,
while theJournal of Heredity, official organ of
this American Genetic Association, declared,
‘the book contains little with which specialists
are not familiar, but it supplies a readable ac-
count of recent work. . . .' and added for good
measure: ‘in the field of anthropology he has
followed the latest authorities."’

"William McDouga||, speaking with authority as
the chairman of the department of psychology at
Harvard University, specifically called for the re-
placement of democracy by a caste system
based upon biological capacity, with legal
restrictions upon breeding by the lower castes
and upon intermarriage between the castes. By
the 1920's such views appeared to predominate
among the scientists and social scientists who
were hereditarian* in their outlook.”

Madison Grant's was just one of many fashionable
and respectable books that appeared in Europe and in
