WASHINGTON, D. C.-—The first mine safety bill
covering non-ferrous metals industry workers ever to

get through either branch of Congress was passed by the

stage -to which any such
measure has been advanced
by Mine-Mill's long fight for
federal legislation to protect
the health and safety of metal

- «miners.

The far-reaching agreement declares recognition of the fact “that the interests
and welfare of the membership of both organizations can be protected and advanced

. bypmutual cooperation and assistance.”
Mine-Mill leaders hailed the alliance as “

a glowing example of trade union unity ,

standing out in positive contrast to the destructive anti-labor policy of suicidal raiding '
which is now tearing the labor movement apart.” '

WASHINGTON,‘ D. C.—
Mine-Mill last month called for
congressional action to provide
federal health care for pen-
sioners through’ social ‘secur-
ity.

President John Clark‘ pre- ‘

sented the union’s position

supporting t _h_ e pr op o s e d.
.. Health Insurance, Benefits Act
of - 1961 in testimony to the

House Ways and Means Com.-
mittee, which concluded hear-
ings on the bill August 4.

. The ,measure (HR 4222),
introduced‘ by Congressman
Cecil King (D., Calif.), would
provide hospital and nursing
home care and home health
services needed but now be-
yond the financial means‘ of
most retired workers.

v‘ I}: * SI:

IN‘ HIS‘ ’ statement, Clark

I

emphasized the bill's special
importance. for meeting the
needs of non-ferrous metals
industry ' workers, from the
mines to the fabricating
plants. A

Citing the characteristic ail-
ments and disabilities especial-
_ly connected with work in this
industry, the Mine-Mill leader
(Said these’ “highlight the ma-
jor health problems, and re-
sulting health care needs, that
may be found among retirees
from the non-ferrous metals
industry.in considerably great-
er degree than among the rest
of the retired population.”

Among the occupational
health and safety hazards he
listed -were ‘_SiliCOSiS‘ and dis-

, eases‘ associated With’ expos-
ure to radon gas, tuberculosis;
cancer and cardiac, arthritic I

_and rheumatic diseases, plus -

very high rates of disabling
injuries. ‘ L A
* SI‘ =l¢'

_ CLARK told the committee‘
_ that A even _ though Mine-Mill

members average higher earn-
ings than most other indus-
trial workers, their retirement
income mainly deriving‘ from
social security and company
pensions is. barely sufficient
to permit a very modest liv-
ing-scale. ‘

Retired persons in these cir-
cumstances, he said, “simply
do -not have -the resources to
pay for hospital and nursing

home care, ‘and frequently ex-‘L

pensive therapy that .is re-

‘quired ‘by «many accidentally-

disabled, or by‘ those‘ with the
industrial .\ diseases» - I have
enumerated.-’;’ V T .

It was signed Aug. 18 ‘for
Mine-Mill by President John ‘
Clark; and for the Teamsters
by President James R. Hoffa

in San Francisco, where Hoffa 

was heading up major truck-

ing negotiations for the West-_ 

er-n states. .

EMBRACING the’ local ,un-

‘ ions and affiliated ‘bodies of_;_
the two Internationals in the

United States and Canada, the
pact pledges that both parties",
will cooperate mutually in all »
major phases of trade union
activity,

against raids; assistance in
bargaining and strikes; co-
ordination of legislative and
political action.

Formal signing followed a_
series of meetings between“
Teamsters and Mine-Mill lead-.
ers over a period of several
months and final approval re-
cently by the International‘
executive boards of both un-

' ions.

Practical methods of imple-
menting the pact’s terms are
to be worked out by joint com-

. mittees representing both or-

ganizations in the U. ‘S. and

He particularly called atten-

fact” that, even with their re-

Another Score for
Buffalo Pensioners

Buffalo Local 593 last month
scored still another victory_ in
its sweep of cases involving
disqualification of -American
Brass Company pensioners for
unemployment compensation
benefits.

Pete Jarka left his employ-
ment as a shear operator at
the Buffalo ABC brass mill be-

‘ cause the job was too arduous

and took his pension benefits
after the company told him
there was no light work avail-
able. When he applied for job-
less benefits he was disquali-
fied on grounds of quitting
without good cause and being
unavailable for work.

A hearing referee upheld
the union in ruling that Jarka
was eligible. The industrial
commissioner appealed for the
company before the N. Y.
State Appeals Board which re-
viewed the case and reaffirmed
the referee’s decision in favor
of the union.

As a result, Jarka, who had
been reporting at the UC of-
fice since last January, will
get a lump sum backbenefits
check of about $1,500 and con-
tinue drawing UC payments
for an additional 13 weeks.

Int’l Rep. Joe Scioli present-
ed the case at the appeal hear-
ing, with George Ekes as wit-
ness for Jarka and the union.

Morenci Settles
Work Grievances

Four grievances scheduled
by Morenci, Ariz., Miners Lo-
cal 616 for arbitration the
week of Aug. 7 were settled
by mutual agreement with
the Phelps Dodge Company.

The cases involved the issue
of smelter supervisors doing
work which overlapped the
jobs of employees represented
by Mine-Mill. Representing
the union in meetings with
management to work out the
settlement were Local 616
President Carl A. Krass, Exe-
cutive Secretary Frank Z.
Morales, Central Grievance
Committee Chairman A. G.
Munoz, PD Council Coordina-
tor Sylvain Schnaittacher and
several active smelter mem-
bers.

As , pointed out in a local
newsletter sent to members,

. the _agreement, "if faithfully

carried out, will result in the
protection of jobs, elimination
of much controversy and sa-
fer conditions through a -clear
understanding of who is to
perform certain operations.
The local, meanwhile, went
ahead with presentation of

Job Case Won at
AS&R Page Mine

A discharge grievance sched-
uled to go to arbitration was
settled at AS&R’s Page Mine
near Kellogg, Ida., last month
when management agreed to
Local 18’s demands to rein-
state the man to his old job
with back pay, fringe benefits
and all rights under the con-
tract.

Mine-Mill member Wendell
Swigart was fired last June
when police picked him up on
the job and jailed him for
three days. The company said
this was not an excused ab-
The grievance was
processed through the third

‘step and the company still

maintained its position, but re-
hired Wendell as a new hire
because they said he had a
good work record.

The union then referred the
grievance -to arbitration and
on Aug. 8, the day after the
arbitrator was selected, the
company agreed to settle the
case. - .

Wendell was reinstated with
no loss of seniority or job
classification, to ‘P the same
stope and the same job he
held before discharge. He was
given back pay for four shifts
actually lost, plus the differ-
ential in pay between the min-
er’s and helper’s rate during
the time he was back as a new

hire. It was also agreed that

he suffer no loss of any other
benefits he would have receiv-
edhad he not been discharged,
such.as the two holidays——Mi-
ners Union Day and July 4.

The charges by the police
against Wendell were also
dropped.

Signing the grievance set-
tlement for the union were
Luther W. Church, Ray A.
Nieland, Paul Church and

Sam Wolff.

BACK PAY RECIPIENTS pose for camera outside Wrigley, 'lenn., local
314 Union Hall. Ray Potts, with arms folded, received largest check,
totaling $1,369.79. Altogether, members received about $5,000 in
back pay as result of Mine-Mill arbitration victory. (See story right.)

Pioneer Day Prize
For Magna Float

A union float entered by
Mine-Mill Local 392 took sec-

ond prize in the hour-long" Pi-'

oneers Day parade at Magna,
Utah, July 24.

The date, celebrated as the
biggest event in Utah during
the year, marks the entrance
of the Mormon Pioneers into
the Salt Lake Valley in 1846.
It is observed with a parade
held by the Oquirrh Stake of
the Latter Day Saints Church
which comprises all L. D. S.
churches in the vicinity of
Magna. A

The float carried banners in
red, white and blue featuring
the names of Mine-Mill, Local
392 and the Kennecott Council.
Riding it were three pretty
young ladies———LaDeen. Hatch,
Barbara Dearing, Janice Ca-

Fred Nuesmeyer- and Del

“for all time lost from April

instatement.” ‘

Union men on the "arbitra-
tion panel were Int’l Rep.

‘George Kalafatich and Local

904 President Doane Sauers.
Attorney Charles Huppe ap-
peared for the union at the
hearing held July 18.

The grievance arose when
Unger was discharged for re-
fusing to slush at a raise sta-
tion where a permanent light
had been broken by a rock
during the previous shift and
had been left unrepaired.

He contended the absence of
a light created an unsafe con-
dition in which to work, and,
instead of slushing at that sta-

tion, pulled rail at-a different ‘

location‘ in the mine during
the rest of his shift.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

  

President's Corner:

Advanced by Pact

NE of the mandates of the last Convention was that
we do everything possible to promote labor unity in
every conceivable way; to play our part in the much
needed program for uniting all labor forces in this coun-
try for the common interests and welfare of organized
labor and the worker to combat and repeal
the suppressive laws which are now ham-
stringing the American labor -movement.

The agreement which has been signed by
me as your International President and by
President Hoffa of the International Brother-
hood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehouse-
men and Helpers of America is a very con-
clusive step in this direction.

Its full text is printed on this page..

The membership of Mine-Mill should read
this agreement carefully and thus counteract
any distortions that the enemies of this
Union or the anti-labor press may no doubt
try to encompass it with.

HE Executive Board of the International and the Canadian
Executive’Board havemet and agreed on the wording of

the agreement and are preparing to set up a joint committee’
’ -with the. Teamsters to outline the physical means toprocess the

pact. . .

I am sure with -the public knowledge of the great organ-
izational advances of the Teamsters Union, who in the past two
years have organized more workers than that of the‘ supposed
combined labor movement, that this announcement an_d the
contents of the agreement will come as a pleasant surprise and a
feeling of deep satisfaction. «

The; appreciation of the membership in the financial aid 1

given by President Hoffa and hisfellow officers during the last
days of our strike against the copper companies and which was
the turning point in its successful conclusion is plainly shown

in their support of these typesof agreements with any or all .

of the labor movement."

HIS can and will lead to the elimination of the despicable and
destructive actions of raiding and dividing the American
labor movement. . ' '

The gulf already built by some of the top leadership of ‘

labor by these tactics and their unholy desire to dictate their
perverted labor policies is so deep that only a dynamic and a

organized: labor movement if some decisive action isn’t taken

- to turn the tide of reaction and conformity so prominent among '

some of the top leadership. .

One militant leader said: “Freedom is supposed to be free-, I
dom of action, the freedom. of association, the freedom to or- _-
ganize and bargain, collectively. Under the Landrum-Griffin

bill and the Taft-Hartley Act, all of these have been wiped out."

worth quoting here.

RE we of Mine-Mi11——whose fight for over 60 years for a
-free labor movement, for a country that can provide all
that is good for its citizens—are we to be forced into silence by
the attacks against us? Whena leader who has had the pro-
verbial book thrown at him can still say in-his pledge _to his
membership after his election, ‘such ringing words as:
“During this discussion, many times our patience has
been tried, many opinions, while not expressed on the floor,

Internationals and in caucuses. I say to you as a: Teamster,
this is what makes us healthy and strong and able to . '
withstand those who do not understand criticism from hon- .

-‘est men, and that is what, after all, has made America I
and created the Revolutionary War.

“From. that time to this, American labor has struggled,
moved ahead, moved back, moved ahead -five times in a ‘
cycle. Unfortunately, delegates sitting here, and mem-
bers back home, ‘this cycle .is again turning, turning ad-
versely for the workers of the United States who are
losing their constitutional guarantees, losing their rights
of free assembly, losing their right of a‘ majority vote,
losing the right, if you please, of all the principles that we ’
preach in the world that are principles the world" should
follow.” ‘ _ _ ‘ _ ,

Under New Social Security Changes

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Early Retirement for Men N ow in Effect

(Prepared by Mine-Mill Research Department)

Men now 62 to 65 years old were eligible last month to
start receiving old-age pension benefits under Social Security.
Amendments to the law have changed the previous rule that
men could not draw retirement pensions before reaching age 65.
Women have been able to retire at age 62 since 1956.

The U.S. Senate Finance Committee, in recommending this
change in the law, said “The provision of benefits at age 62
for men will help alleviate the hardships . . . of men who, be-
cause of ill health, automation, or other technological change,
are forced into premature retiremen .” The Social Security
Administration says a man considering early retirement will
want to weigh a number of factors, including his health, whether
he is employed, his earning power, and his family situation.

He Will also need to consider the reduced benefits payable
under Social Security and industrial pension plans to those re-
tiring before age 65.

* ll‘ *

SOCIAL SECURITY pension payments are based on a
man's average earnings from 1951 onwards in most cases. In
figuring average earnings, the five years of lowest income
are “dropped out” of the calculation. This is helpful for those
who suffered from temporary disablement or unemployment.

But for those who retire early the years from date of re-
tirement, up to the time age 65 is reached, are included in the
base period. Since no earnings can be attributed to these years,
they are “dropped out” in the calculation of average earnings.
The effect of this is to require the inclusion of earlier years in
the calculation which would be “dropped out”  the man worked
to age 65. Since only $3600 per year in earmngs was taxable
for Social Security from 1951 through 1954, and only $4200 from
1955 through 1958, the inclusion of earlier years in the calcula-
tion of average earnings has the effect of lowering the average
earnings base on which Social Security pensions are calculated.

Moreover, pensions based on average earnings are reduced
for those retiring at age 62 by 20 percent of the amount payable
upon retirement at age 65, and by proportionately lesser
amounts for retirement at ages 63 and 64. /

ANYONE considering early retirement should consult his
local Social Security office for assistance in figuring what his
benefit would be upon early retirement, compared with What he
could expect to get by continuing to work to age 65. He should

CONGRESSMAN R i c ha I‘ d
Ichord (D.,‘ Mo.) was one of_

the few mining state Congress-

lead mine output, and includes
mines of the St. Joseph Lead
Co., and the closed National
Lead Co., .mine at Frederick-

In the debate on the bill,
Ichord said the Edmondson
bill “wﬂl merely help one seg-
ment 'of the industry at the

only affect a small percentage
of the total workers involved
and the ultimate result will be
a shift in jobs and production

BRASS AND WIRE MILLS’ biggest customers are the
metal fabricating industries——those which buy wire and mill
shapes and make them into electrical motors, radio and TV
sets, industrial machinery,
trucks, autos and airplanes, pins and needles and hundreds of
other products. Figures compiled by the trade paper, Ameri-
can Metal Market from the 1958 Census of» Manufacturers indi-
cate that in that year, metal fabricating establishments used
900,756 tons of copper and brass wire, mill shapes and forms,
and castings. ’

This was equivalent to about two thirds of all refined
copper consumed in the United States in that year. The other
big user of copper products, the construction industry, buys

water tubing, sheets, architectural shapes, gutters and wire .

direct from the mills, from where these products go into build-
ings of all kinds withoutfurther fabrication.

Here is a breakdown showing the percentages of the 900,756
tons of copper used by major industry groups among the metal
fabricators in 1958:

- Percent of Total
Consumption by

— Fabricators

Military ordnance and accessories  2.5
Fabricated products (tools, hardware, 0

valves, etc.) ____________________________________________________________ __31.9
Machinery except electrical ___________________________________ __13.3
Electrical equipment, machinery and

appliances ................................................................ ..34.9
Automobiles, Aircraft, locomotives,

trucks, etc _________________________________________________________________ __12.6
Instruments, miscellaneous and not

classified .................................................................. __ 4.8

One interesting feature of the above breakdown is the very
small percentages of refined copper used in the manufacture
of military ordnance. Only 22,693 tons were used for this
purpose in 1958, or less than one-third the tonnage of refined
copper used for this purpose in 1954, according to the census.
The declining use of copper for military purposes reflects the
substitution of plastics for many applications of brass, and a
shift in the types of weapons and equipment now coming into

use.

PHELPS-DODGE is investing $3,400,000 in a brass mill in
Argentina which will require an estimated total investment of

-$11,900,000.‘ Biggest single invester in the project is the Argen-

pants in the venture include a private Argentine holding com-
pany and AB Svenska Mettalverken, a Swedish producer of
non-ferrous products.

PLASTICS loom ever larger as a competitor of metals in
many applications. Dupont has announced construction of a
plant in Oklahoma to manufacture oil field pipe of Delrin, its
new tough, plastic that cost $50,000,000 to -develop, Polymer
Corp., of Reading, Pennsylvania, has announced introduction of‘

a new process for casting nylon which allows low cost produc- V

Polymer sees a big market for these castings in the as-_

industry and industrial plant improvement.

>i< =8 iii

THE House-passed bill di-
rects the Secretary of the In-
terior to investigate:

1) the cause of injuries and
health hazards in metal and
non-metallic mines, other than
coal; 2) relative effectiveness
of voluntary vs. mandatory re-
porting of accident statistics;
3) relative merits of programs

’ giving right-of-entry to inspect

and those giving right-of-en-
try plus enforcement author-
ity; 4) effectiveness of health

- and safety education training ;

5) magnitude of efforts and
costs of each of the foregoing;

‘ 6) scope and adequacy of state

mine safety laws and their en-
forcement. - A

It also empowers the Bu-
reau of Mines to inspect mines
in the course of this investiga-
tion and to require reports
from mine operators.

In addition, the bill gives

' the Secretary of Interior two

years to complete his investi-
gation and report back to Con-
gress. This report could well
set the stage for the kind of
permanent mine safety legis-
lation .which Mine-Mill has
been advocating for years.

swered by a supporting note
later in the sessions from
Thiirgood Marshall, director-
counsel of the NAACP legal de-

Urging the organization to
once again be called “unreason-

‘ able, intolerant and impatient,”

Marshall said the NAACP
must bring its struggle “into
every town and hamlet
throughout the country, North
as well as South.” He called on
Negroes everywhere to take
their children to the nearest
schools, insisting they be reg-
istered. '

RECENT events make it {E
clear that the Steel union dur-. -
ing the past several years had
been working to set up the _
kind of situation they wanted . ‘
together with a group of local '
leaders who put their own sel-
fish interests before the wel-‘ 
fare of the union membership.$;:¢:~._3

While Steel squeezed in-by” ,_-V;;.:
a paper-thin margin at ABC, , 
the tremendous rank and file
vote for Mine-Mill in the An-
sonia election. was credited
here with making the Thomas-
ton victory possible. , 

Thomaston Plume and. At-
wood brass workers, under- ‘
stood the Ansonia result was
just a temporary turn-over of 4
the union by a group of self-
seeking local leaders to Steel,-«g
In addition, the costs of such’

 

  

, unprincipled action had already ’

become apparent with. the p ,
company riding rough-shod .'
over the workers in Ansonia
after their loss of the Mine- 1
Mill contract. 7

RECOGNIZING the‘ nature‘ '
of the sell-out in Ansonia and‘ 

‘knowing that the "Ansonia

workers are looking for Mine-
Mill to come back, the Thom-
aston rank and file refused to
be misled. They viewed the‘
Steel move by several local
leaders as just a plot against
the membership, and rejected _ .
it with deep resentment. - _

While the Steelworkers had 9 7
five staff organizers distribut- A
ing raid leaflets, they could’ ‘
only get‘ two, or three local\fof-
ficers to assist them. .On the --
other hand, Mine-Mill I had” 
many active rank and file sup- * I
porters rallying ‘to defeat the
raid. - ' ‘ .

Without even.being ‘asked, a .
group of veteran, rank and
file. leaders volunteered to be-
come a Mine-Mill Committee-
which conducted a vigorous‘.
campaign both in and out-of. J
the plant. ' I ,

It was the members of this
group, together with District
6» staff "members, who helped
lead the way to victory on the
major issues of ' Mine-Mill
unity and bargaining power in 
the brass and copper industry, I

. union democracy, and 19 years '

of contract gains at Plume
