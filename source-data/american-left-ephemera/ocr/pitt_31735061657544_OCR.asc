tions dropped from $324 million in 1951 to $270 million in
1953——despite rising payrolls.

The phony “merit-rating” system which favors mo-
nopoly and penalizes the small employer resulted in
51.6% of ﬁrms in New York State with only 25% of the
total payroll paying the top tax rate of 2.7% in 1953
while only 24.7% of the companies with 49.2% of the
payrolls paid taxes from 2% down to the minimum of
0.7%. '

Since no one employer, especially among the small
seasonal trades, soft goods and retail industries, can be
held responsible for market conditions and the stability
of employment, it would be fairer for the entire industrial
wor1d—all emp1oyers—to be charged with the same rate;
that of 2.7%. It would be proﬁtable to the majority
of employers who are now penalized under this system
for the beneﬁt of the Trusts, to join in asking that “merit-
rating” be abandoned. ' .

But even more important an argument for eliminating
this system is that it menaces the Whole future.of beneﬁt
payments. During the past three years of relatively low
unemployment the Insurance Fund has swelled until at
the end of 1953 it Was over $1,300,000,000. Yet it does
not provide an adequate cushion against a prolonged
period of unemployment.

In January 1954, with the rise of unemployment, New
York beneﬁt payments exceeded the average monthly in-
come of the fund—in a nutshell, there was more going

joblessness doubles, beneﬁt payments, -even under the
present inadequate schedule, will approach $600 million
yearly while receipts, with declining payrolls, will fall
t oaround $255,000,000 yearly. It ‘takes no mathematical
genius to ﬁgure out that in four years the Fund will be
bankrupt. Then What?

The ALP unemployment insurance program is aimed
at stemming the inroads into the beneﬁt fund by Big

WORKERS NOT YET INSURED

We have been talking about the 41/2 million covered
by insurance. But the nearly 2 million who Work on farms
or who are not covered despite employment in farm

processing industries, who are employed as household I

workers, in government, and in establishments with four
or less employees, should be included in the general bene-
ﬁt program. Without them the security in unemployment
insurance is like a “tripod” with two legs.

Exclusion of farm workers in jobless beneﬁts keeps
down the wage scale and maintains the heavy exploita-
tion of farm labor; it adds to the undemocratic servitude
status of domestic Workers, and discriminates against
Workers in small four-or—less shops.

The State Advisory Council on Employment and Un-
employment Insurance has already recommended extend-
ing coverage to the nearly 500,000 Workers in small es-
tablishments, a step taken by 17 other states. But why
stop there? . -

NEED FOR A SINGLE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT
INSURANCE SYSTEM

Leading social security experts have long advocated a
single federal system of unemployment insurance. Today
that need is imperative. Different states, like different
Wage scales and tax levels, are used by employers to
reap huge proﬁts, undermine labor conditions and im-
pair the social fabric of our democracy.

The runaway shop movement, for instance, has hit New
York State hard. Employers “ﬂee” to the South with

its low wages, non-union or anti-union labor conditions
and reactionary state provisions. These backward Leg-
islatures use “merit-rating” as an excuse to weaken un-

“induce” employers to remain in the State and “lure”
manufacturers elsewhere to settle in the area.

The various Chambers of Commerce of the States with
weakened unemployment insurance systems and lower
tax rate-s compete to “invite” employers. Who gets hurt?
The laboring man, the union, the jobless——and in the long
run, all of democratic society.

Eisenhower dodged the issue of federal action in his
Economic Report. The New York Legislature should
not; it should petition Congress for enactment of a single
federal system of jobless insurance.

WAGE INCREASES ..

Wages in New York State are Way too low. The Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics family budget—a very modest
standard of living——requires at least $4300 in the cities
of the Empire State as of now. Yet the average annual
earnings of a state factory, Worker in January, 1954, was
only $3,679, short of the very minimum BLS budget
by $600. - . ~

New York State workers have a vital bread-and-butter
stake in labor’s legislative proposals for a boost in federal
minimum wages of 75 cents to $1.25 an hour with cor-
responding increases in wage scales here. Only half of the
private wage and salary workers in. the state are cov-
ered by the federal wage and hour law. Another 20%
ar-e covered by state -law, leaving 1,500,000 workers or
30% of the total labor force, without minimum wage pro-
tection. Among them are service workers, all domestic
workers, most construction workers, many trade employ-
ees, all farm workers and many workers engaged in proc-
essing of farm commodities.

employment insurance and claim that it is necessary to _

The ALP favors extension of minimum wages to all
workers, eliminating exemptions which exclude workers
from federal coverage; ending exclusion of domestic
workers from the state law, and putting into elfect the

minimum wage for another, 650,000 workers supposed to

be covered by the law but at present not getting the
beneﬁts of the minimum wage order.

The 75 cents federal wage minimum is ridiculous in
the light of present day prices and living standards.
If the more than million state Workers getting less than
the $1.25 an hour sought by labor as a minimum, were
to get that as a minimum Wage, the effect would be felt
in a general rising wage bracket, increased purchasing
power, reduced runaway shops in many industries, and
a healthier community.

Along with this federal Wage minimum increase should
go its complement, the reduced work week. The 40-hour
week is out of date. Workers produce one-third to one-
half more in 40 hours in most industries than when the
law was ﬁrst enacted. A shorter Work Week is vital to
stem unemployment due to speed-up and technical ad-
vances.

The ALP supports the demand for a 30-hour week
with 40 hours pay, along with the proposals for federal
and state Wage and hour provisions to provide time and
a half for all work in excess of 35 hours per week.

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

Discrimination—systematic, continuous and brutal-
against Negro and Puerto Rican Workers is a major
factor towards poor living standards and unemployment,
nationally and in New York State.

The old adage, last to be hired, ﬁrst to be ﬁred, for
these great minority peoples is a disgraceful truism in
New York State. The last census showed that unemploy-
ment in New York City for White males (non Puerto

Ricans) was 6.9 percent, for Negroes 11.6% and for
Puerto Ricans 16.6%. Upstate, the discrimination in jobs
was even worse. Among women the ratio of discrimina-
tion topped the men.

How does discrimination affect jobs and living condi-
tions? A glance at some statistics tells the story.

The average white person in New York City in 1949
earned about $2517 a year; the average Negro $1707
or 32% less; the average Puerto Rican $1647. These
ﬁgures do not tell the whole story. Taking $4000 a year
as a livable income about 20% of. the whites in New
York City did that or better, while only 2% of the Ne-
groes received $4000 or more.

If there was no job bias in New York City the spend-
ing power of Negroes and Puerto Ricans immediately
would increase by $600,000,000!

It would mean at least another 30,000 workers em-
ployed in shops, stores, restaurants, theatres. 1

It would mean another $60,000,000 in farm income
brought about by increased food purchases.

It would mean another $100,000,000 ‘spent for clothing
with 6,000 more clothing and shoe workers employed
nationally, a good part of them in New York State, and
another 5,000 textile jobs with several hundred in the
state.

Even Secretary of Welfare Mrs. Hobby has often said
that elimination of discrimination in jobs would add from
$15 to $30 billion in the people’s purchasing power. _ The
United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers estimates
that the income of the Negro people raised to parity
with that of white people would create a market for
800,000 new automobiles, 675,000 refrigerators and 725,-
000 television sets.

The increased demand for the aforementioned com-
modities would mean 140,000 more jobs in auto, refrig-

erator and television industries alone, plus another 110,-.

000 jobs for workers in metal industries and other sup-

plier industries. Of these additional jobs, 20,000 would
come to New York State.

FOREIGN TRADE -

Trade is the economic artery of a nation; it is the
bloodstream for Prosperity. New York is the world’s
greatest port. When it ﬂourishes, when it hits its vast
Cargo potential there is employment, purchasing power,
“good times.”

A U.S. Government study showed that in 1947 there
were 920,000 workers in New York State manufacturing
industries allied or linked, in one way or another, to ex-
port trade. .

There were 1,140,000 state workers employed in plants
dependent in whole or in part on import trade.

There were 163,000 longshore, maritime, freight for-
warding, warehousing, packing and crating, trucking and
allied trades largely dependent on foreign trade, not to
mention the shipyard workers who build ships or are out
of work in direct ratio to foreign trade spirals. .

Add them up-—and include the clerical and sales work-
ers in import and export ﬁrms, ﬁre and marine insurance
companies, banks and brokerage houses, etc.—and you
get a tremendous army of New Yorkers whose livelihood
and families depend on trade.

New York State farm products average $40,000,000

yearly in exports. Trade is a hot issue with dairy and

fruit farmers upstate, too.

The U.S. Department of State report summarized: “To
illustrate the signiﬁcance of exports to New York work-
ers, it has been estimated that 1.7 million American non-
agricultural workers were dependent upon exports for
their employment in 1949. A proportionate share of these
workers—probably more than 250,000—are employed in
New York, and their employment in well-paid jobs con-
tributes to the prosperity of all the citizens of the Sta .”

MORE TRADE — MORE JOBS

If in 1949 New Yorkers held on to 250,000 jobs depen-
dent on foreign trade, then in1947 there were 350,000
such jobs, because unemployment in New York State
jumped by 200,000 between those two years. Therefore,
about half the loss of jobs in the state was due to the
decline in foreign trade.

Today the foreign trade drop is more critical—going
and coming. It is worse than 1949 because all over the
world competitive exporters from Germany, Western
Europe, Japan are substituting their products for U.S.
merchandise to buyers who are caught with a “dollar
shortage” and cannot purchase American goods for cash.

There is only one way to open up foreign trade: that is
by removing trade barriers between the United States
and the Soviet Union, Eastern European countries and
China.

Today 800,000,000 people or 36% of the world’s popu-
lation live in countries which a hysterical McCarthyized
trade concept has barred from our ports.

It doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t make jobs, it doesn’t
make for a secure, happy America.

The nations on the U.S. embargo list have repeatedly
offered to trade with us. In 1952 the USSR proposed
to buy over a billion dollars worth of goods from us in
two-three years, more than twice its proposed purchases
in other nations. China offered to pass its previous trade
peak with the U.S. when it bought $500 million in goods
here in 1946.

What does it mean to you, Mr. and Mrs. New Yorker,
that we trade with Russia, Czechoslovakia, China, Bul-
garia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, East Germany and
Albania?

It means a $7 billion yearly trade!

It means jobs for 1,250,000 American Workers!

It means 125,000 more jobs for New York State alone

18

    

—-enough to wipe out the employment drop in the past
12 months.

Whatever the industry—electrical, industrial machin-
ery, ships, locomotives, trucks, metals, leather products
and other industries relying on foreign trade-—the East-
ern European nations, particularly the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, and the Republic of China in Asia,
are the biggest market for America.

The USSR contracted more than $500,000,000 in elec-
trical orders with British businessmen this year with a
trade potential of more than a billion; it purchased $250,-
000,000 in leather products and similar consumer goods
from other capitalist nations last year (but not from us) ;
it is negotiating for vast purchases of drugs and metals
and copper and ﬁnished machine products from England,
France, West Germany, South American and Latin
American nations (but not from us).

The unvarnish‘ed truth is that the Soviet Union is con-
tracting for thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in
increased purchasing power for millions of workers all
over the world in their trade deals with other nations;
jobs and dollars and purchasing power and additional
prosperity that could be the lot of American workers but
for the stupid and suicidal trade ban with the second most
powerful nation on earth.

LOW-COST HOUSING

The most pressing public works program before the
federal and state governments, particularly in New York

V State, is the construction of hundreds of thousands of

low-rent housing units. A vast construction program,
always one of the key aspects in any governmental plan
to alleviate unemployment distress while satisfying fun-
damental housing, highway, school and recreational needs
of the people, is at present inextricably linked to the
worsening housing crisis in New York State.

In 1950 in New York State, there were 750,000 sub-’

standard homes and many of the 190,000 homes not
listed in the Census Bureau were also unﬁt for habita-
tion. More than 21/; million New Yorkers live in dwell-

ings without private toilets, hot water facilities, and the ,

most elementary safety and health safeguards.

The crisis hasdeepened since 1950. To keep up merely
with population growth and shifts New York City alone
requires 60,000 new homes a year.

But no single year since 1950 has seen as many homes
built in the entire state.

City Planning Commission experts report between 300,-
000 and 525,000 substandard homes in New York City,
and this is a very conservative estimate. As many as
1,500,000 New York City residents live in these rat-in-
fested, ﬁre-trap dwellings.

The breakdown on federal, state and city levels in low-
rent housing construction has swelled the slum and ghetto
areas of New York City. The city housing experts ad-
mit-—and again this is a rock-bottom ﬁgure-—that be-
tween 40,000 to 45,000 new units are needed to begin to
meet population demands. But in the seven years from
1946 to 1952 New York City’s new housing construction
was 29,107, one-fourth that built annually during the
Twenties and below even the depression days of the
Thirties.

Private builders, abetted by loose rent control laws
which are priced far beyond the budget of the average
tenant, have failed dismally in providing housing needs
for the majority of dwellers.

It is obvious that only a big program, geared to meet
the housing demands of most of New York’s hard-pressed
tenants is essential.

The American Labor Party, as an integral feature of
its anti-depression and employment program, proposes:
l—A billion dollar state housing bond issue.

21

   

2—Doubling of the authority of the cities to issue
housing bonds.
3—Doubling of low-cost housing subsidy funds.
Construction of 75,000 new homes a year would give
New York State 80,000 additional construction jobs and
employ another 60,000 workers in -supplier industries.

   
  
   
   
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

In January 1954 there were 43,515 unemployed con-
struction and building trades Workers registered with
unemployment insurance. Allowing for those not regis-
tered because of disqualiﬁcations, beneﬁt exhaustion, etc.,
this means that some 67,000 jobless construction work-
ers—the ﬁgure is nearer 100,000-—were seeking employ-
ment early this year.

3 MORE SCHOOLS — MORE JOBS

No discussion of a public works program or new con-
struction can make sense unless it includes the vast
problem of rebuilding and rehabilitating the New York
State, and particularly, the New York City school system.

A few statistics culled from the Board o-f Education's
own reports tell the story. »

Schools are overcrowded in New York City by an esti-
mated 63,000 students with 36.5% of the classes seating
35 or more students instead of the State Education De-
partment’s proposed 20-30 students.

275 of the schools are 19th Century relics.

More than 200 are ﬁre-traps, either completely or in
part.

By December 1953, there was a backlog of repair and
rehabilitation work, left undone, amounting to $75,-
000,000.

The situation is not much better upstate.

In New York City at least 50 new schools are needed
annually instead of the 22 projected for this year with
a $35 million annual maintenance and repair budget. The

22

total $175 million annual capital program, 21/2 times the
present expenditures, would still take 10 years to elimi-
nate the worst school building hazards and replace them
with new schools.

The ALP program for a $600,000,000 state bond issue
to be shared upstate and by New York City for construc-
tion; for a $100,000,000 state cash appropriation to re-
pair and modernize and acquire school sites; for a $10
billion federal school aid plan to be spent at the rate of $2
billion a year and yielding more than $200,000,000 an-
nually to New York State; for increases in city debt limit
to 12% %, and with corresponding changes in the present
unfair state-city ﬁscal relationship, would:

l—Provide 25,000 to 30,000 new construction jobs in
New York State.

2—Provide another 20,000 to 25,000 jobs for workers
in allied industries.

FARM INCOME AND JOBS

New York State is a major farm state with more than
500,000 people living on its 125,000 farms. It leads the
entire Atlantic Seaboard in the value of its farm produc-
tion and is 12th nationally; it is second nationally in
dairy products and ﬂowers and nursery products. Dairy
farming is its main type with 63% of commercial farm-
ers engaged in dairy production, and dairy products ac-
count for 51% of all farm products sold.

Yet New York farmers have lost ground faster than
those in other parts of the country. While farm prices

.for farmers elsewhere dropped 3% between January

1953 and January 1954, they fell 10% for New York
farmers. I
Farmers are hit hard when industrial workers are un-
employed. Milk consumption and dairy product sales drop
in the cities; the upstate farmers feel the pinch.
Farm laborers and migratory workers, more than any

23

    

  

single farm group, suffer most from unemployment and
depressed conditions. These workers, 80,000 of whom are
employed on some 7,000 fruit and vegetable farms, live
under the most outrageous oppressive exploitation, bor-
dering in some cases on virtual peonage.

Almost half of these seasonal workers are migrants,
25,000 of them Southern Negroes, 4,000 from Puerto Rico
and the British West Indies, 3,500 white workers from
Pennsylvania, and 2,000 from within New York State.
Aside from the primitive conditions under which they
work their wages, on a piece rate basis, were no higher
in 1951 than in 1944 despite a 50% rise in living costs.

The situation has caused social and labor organizations
deep concern, enough to pressure the state to conduct
an investigation and submit a report. The conditions and
wages and hours of migrant workers are a drag on all
workers. It must be emphasized that the big fruit and
vegetable growers do not employ migrants because there
is a lack of available workers locally; they employ mi-
grants rather than local unemployed workers because
they get away with substandard wages. This not only
maintains an inhuman proﬁteering system but also a
labor surplus in the general labor market of these areas
of the state, enabling other employers‘ to depress wages.

The ALP proposes legislation to provide the 75 cents
minimum Wage to all farm laborers; enforcement of the
child labor law and a state-paid subsidy of $5 a Week for
each child of a migratory‘ worker; state contribution of
half the cost for decent housing for farm workers; Work-
men’s compensation to migrants; modiﬁcation of working

 

time qualiﬁcations for unemployment insurance to allow.

for the short season; along with school construction in
major farm migrant areas and ﬁnancial assistance to
those migrants who wish to remain in the state.

MORE JOBS THROUGH PUBLIC WORKS

Other proposals to combat rising unemployment and
24

raise living standards in New York State are mentioned
here in summary form. Some are in the ﬁeld of Federal

' activity, others require state and local action.

Federal: A substantial boost in old age and other so-
cial security beneﬁts; a $5 billion annual program of public
works, including flood control and public power projects;
(especially do we advocate full development of the St.
Lawrence seaway project to supply cheap-er electric power
to the people of New York State); national health in-
surance; and increased highway aid to states.

State and Local Programs: A real highway construc-
tion program which would not be built as a pork-barrel
project such as the present Thruway. The Thruway,
ballyhooed as the greatest highway program of the age,
is reaching astronomical ﬁgures and is proceeding at a
snail’s pace. Even when built it cannot begin to meet
transportation needs.

The ALP advocates that all future public works con-
struction be supervised and ﬁnanced by government and
not by Authorities which are tools of the banking inter-
ests. It urges construction of free public parking facilities
in big cities; doubling of relief and public assistance in
the cities; repeal of the Transit Authority fare boost;
and complete modernization of the Port of New York
—with repeal of the Waterfront Commission Act.

WHERE'S THE MONEY TO COME FROM?

It is the responsibility of those who ask for increased
spending to help ﬁnd and raise the necessary funds for
their proposals. The American Labor Party recognizes
that the Federal Government is the chief tax collector
in the nation and with the biggest budget of any govern-
mental entity, should be the No. 1 target for any ﬁscal
program.

25

  

1. A PEACE BUDGET

The Federal arms budget must be revised and readjusted
to a peace basis.— How? By a program of understanding,
amity and agreement to bring about similar arms reduc-
tion in all lands; by agreement to outlaw the A and H
bombs, by ending the “massive retaliation” diplomacy
which alienat-es our allies, increases tensions with the
Soviet Union and China and recreates war danger
points; by stopping the remilitarization program for
Germany and agreement on a united Germany; by re-
moving most of our bases and garrisons in far-ﬂung
lands-—in short, by a policy that is based on a return to
the Big Five unity principles of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt. Such a policy would make obsolete the fan-
tastic arms expenditures now saddling the people and
would release billions of dollars for peacetime jobs.

. 2. TAX THE PROFITEERS

Tax loopholes for the big corporations and wealthy
be tightened. The monopolies and individual moguls es-
cape with $10 billion in tax payments yearly. A striking
example of proﬁte-ering is described in the N. Y. Times
of July 21, 1954. Earnings of General Electric for the 1st
six months of 1954 went up 24% over last year to $93,-
000,000—despite a drop in sales of 7%. The Times article
states: “The expiration of the excess proﬁts tax contri-
buted materially to the sharp increase in earnings.”

We propose that the Eisenhower program of further
kickbacks and concessions to the rich be defeated. With
this should be enacted tax reductions on low incomes,
increased personal tax exemptions and reduced taxation
on excises. ‘

3. FINANCIAL HOME RULE FOR NEW YORK CITY

We say that New York City, heart of the nation’s
ﬁnancial and marketing strength, requires increased

26

 

 

revenues to meet the needs of its people. Because of the
banker grip on the city made possible by its political con-

"trol of the state apparatus, and through its inﬂuences

in the local administration, only a radical change in the
present state-city alignment can bring about fundamental
ﬁscal improvements for New York City’s more than
8,000,000 citizens. .

The ALP urges a change in the state constitution to
restore home rule to New York City as well as for paral-
lel revisions to upstate communities; to end the present
State limitations on the city’s borrowing power for capi-
tal construction; to increase the city’s taxing powers on
real estate; and to boost the statutory limits on its con-
stitutional spending provisions.

The American Labor Party urges state transfer to the
city of 50% of all revenues from taxes on big ﬁnance and
industry, including a bank tax, corporation and utility
tax, corporation franchise tax, inheritance and state tax,
and the stock transfer tax. The State can make up its
loss of revenues from these sources by additional taxes
on giant industry and Wealthy individuals and by restora-
tion of taxes on corporations that were reduced during the
Dewey Administration. ,

Though New York City banks do one-third of all the
banking business in the country and derive a large share
of national banking proﬁts, the city gets no revenue
from the bankers except for the relatively small sums
assessed on their buildings—and these buildings are
greatly underassessed.

The political inﬂuence of Big Business is not limited
to ﬁnancial pressure. The connection of big corporate
interest, utilities and giant realty groups with the politi-
cal machines is evident in the failure of the city to ade-

,quately assess their properties at true worth.

The American Labor Party has for years exposed the
fact that the Stock Exchange, banks, newspaper build-
ings, big hotels, corporation and industrial plants, depart-

27

   

ment stores, monopoly realty holdings and other vested
commercial interests are assessed today virtually the same
as during 1932—a depression year.

The tax yield from these properties, if honestly and
realistically assessed would net the city as much as $150,-
000,000 in the,estimate of some realty experts.

PEACE AND JOBS — THEY GO TOGETHER

This anti-depression program is published and dis-
tributed as a public service to bring the people and their
organizations—regardless of politics, party, creed, re-
ligion, race or color—into a common struggle for jobs and
peace. This is their heritage. This is their birthright.
But it will not be the fruits of their labor, nor the reali-
zation of their dreams, unless all of us—however W-e may
disagree -on one or another aspect of the program—join

, to ﬁght poverty, unemployment, reaction and War.

We say that witch-hunts never produced a single thing
to Wear, eat or enjoy; that the Bill of Rights is the “staff
of life’’ for enlightened, democratic Americans; and that
if it is destroyed, so is the economic potential of mil-
lions of Wage-earners.

A program for jobs, to make sense, must be a rededi-
cation to democracy. That is why We agree with Sen.
Flanders’ deﬁnition of McCarthyism as “Hitlerism.” We
oppose this fascist menace and, along with it, all the by-
product diseases of rampant, reactionary hysteria. We
declare that full employment, public Works measures or
expanded social welfare cannot be Won while McCarthy-
ism, Brownellism, Smith acts, McCarran-Walter acts,
red-baiting, witch-hunting, “loyalty” oaths and book-
burning plague the land and terrorize the people.

We offer this program in deep faith that the American
people will win this crucial campaign for decency and
dignity. But this anti-depression program can become
a reality only in -a world at peace. What good are plans

and job programs if an H-bomb can snuff out people,
jobs, resources and even the future itself.

Realistically, this means, in the words of Paul L. Ross,
chairman of the A.L.P. Council on Public Affairs, in his
speech of May 6th, “The settlement of all existing inter-
national issues by negotiations on the basis of equality
of nations.” And more speciﬁcally, it means the re-estab-
lishment of normal peaceful relations between the U.S.
and the Soviet Union. These are the two most powerful
nations in the world, each owning A-bombs and H-bombs,
each capable of destroying civilization or developing life
to a level never known before. They must live with one
another or destroy the world.

Peace and Jobs-—they go together!

THE UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION

Whether it be called “Recession,” “Cyclical Disloca-
tion” or “Temporary Adjustment,” unemployment in
New York State and the nation generally has risen to
alarming proportions. Call it what you will-—and jobless
workers can’t eat deﬁnitions—the stark facts are that
more than 600,000 able-bodied men and women in the
Empire State alone are idle through no fault of their
own.

Most of them are married. They have wives, children,
parents to support. See the picture in terms of rent,
milk, meat, clothes, education, a hospital bill, a dental
visit, a new dress, a TV repair, a glass of beer, the occa-
sional movie, the much-needed vacation, the unpaid mort-
gage, the auto payment—picture, in terms of human
suffering, what happens to a family when the job is gone.
Then picture it 600,000 times from one end of the state
to the other.

However you look at it, it’s a crisis!

And not even the best-fed swivel-chaired economist
will deny any longer that of all the workers covered by
unemployment insurance in New York State, 1 out of 10
is either fully unemployed or suﬂiciently jobless to
qualify for insurance beneﬁts.

The Big Business crowd for whom GM chief and now
Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson had the gall to
say that “what is good for General Motors is good for
America” have been getting“ away with billions in tax
rebates, concessions and outright gifts in capital plant
construction and subsidies. Neither the Eisenhower nor
the Dewey Administrations have lifted their ﬁngers to
alleviate the plight of the “little man.” But their own
oﬁicial agencies and statistics cry out for action against
the steamrolling unemployment.

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FACTS?

The U.S. Department of Labor, by March 1954, listed
only Rochester in New York State as an area of “bal-
anced labor supply.” All of the other six ‘major market
areas in the state were described as having a “moderate
labor surplus” or in such towns as Gloversville and Hud-
son, a “substantial labor surplus.” In plain English a
“moderate labor surplus” means serious unemployment;
a “substantial labor surplus” means a “ghost” town‘
with plants shut, stores closed, relief rolls soaring and
a crisis at hand.

' 9.1 percent of all insured workers in New York State
were completely jobless as of last February. In New York
City this ﬁgure was 8.8%. In the Albany-Schenectady-
Troy area, a pivotal industrial section, it was 9.9%;
7.2% in Buffalo; 9.1% in Nassau and Suffolk counties;
14.2% in the Utica-Rome-Herkimer-Little Falls area;
and 12.4% in Westchester.

Those are statistics. Behind those digits are people, 3

children, aged men and women. Behind those ﬁgures
are the haunting fears that ravaged America in the
Thirties.

Since February the crisis has mounted. Unlike other
years when jobs picked up in late winter and spring
after the January layoffs, the number of registered un-
employed did not go down during February and March.
Even worse, there was a sharp rise in unemployment in
most upstate cities and in Rochester, a so-called “norma ”
employment city, the jobless increase was 31% in Feb-
ruary. '

Compared to February, 1953, unemployment was up
56% in New York City, 15% in Albany-Schenectady-
Troy, 32% in Binghampton, 116% in heavily-industrial-
ized Buffalo, 220% in Elmira, 86% in Nassau-Suffolk,
62% in Rochester, 140% in Syracuse, 86% in Utica,
67% in Westchester——and 61% in the State as a whole.

From consumer goods industries, the layoffs are spread-
ing to so-called “hard goods.” Read some of the extracts
from the March Labor Market Letters of the State La-
bor Department:

“Steel works and electro-metallurgical mills, with
business slack, laid off more Workers and increased re-
course to short work weeks . . . non-ferrous metals and
forging plants also forced to reduce staffs . . . electrical
machinery employment continued to drop. . . .”

And more and more of the same gloomy picture every-
where in the state.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

One of the current myths is that unemployment in-
surance is adequate protection against unemployment.
Ask the jobless family bread-winner how much his maxi-
mum beneﬁt is providing and you’ll get a swift answer:
—hardly enough to keep his own body and soul together,
much less that of his wife and children.

Unemployment Insurance is supposed to be the work-
er’s ﬁrst line of defense against joblessness. Right now
it's a mere handout, offering a pittance in the face of 15
percent rent increases, 50% fare boosts, rocketing food
costs and all-time high prices.

Unemployment insurance was a major issue in the
Legislature at the last session. It will be so until basic
adjustments are made. We propose that the State Leg-
islature improve jobless beneﬁts to:

1——Extend beneﬁts from 26 to 39 weeks, eliminate
the 1-week waiting period, and delays in payments.
. 2—Increase maximum beneﬁts from $30 to $40 a week.
3—Extend coverage to all wage and salary workers
now excluded. '
4—Eliminate the Hughes-Brees amendment which re-
quires 20 Weeks work in the previous year to qualify.

5

5—Eliminate the “merit rating” plan which allows
large employers to chisel on jobless beneﬁt taxes.

6—Process organized workers for unemployment bene-
ﬁts through their union oﬁices.

7—End the authorization for employers to disqualify
workers.

ARE INSURED WORKER'S REALLY "INSURED"?

To get down to bedrock. on this problem let us examine
the who, what, when and how of unemployment insur-
ance.

There are about 4% million workers in New York State
covered by unemployment insurance. Another 2 million
work in small establishments, on farms or for govern-
mental and non-proﬁt agencies who are not insured.

Actually, the state pays out_ in beneﬁts for less than
one half of the total unemployed time of all its insured
workers. There were 27,900,000 man-weeks of unem-
ployment among insured workers in 1950 but beneﬁts
in New York State were paid for only 13,200,000 Weeks
or 47.3% of the total.

What happened to the other 14,700,000 Weeks of un-
employment?

Here you run into the rigmarole of bureaucracy, red-
tape, legislative interpretations, legalisms and just plain
employer ruthlessness. Hundreds of thousands were de-
clared “ineligible” or “disqualiﬁed” for payments because
the Hughes-Brees law requires 20 Weeks of Work in the
previous year to be qualiﬁed for beneﬁts.

Right off the bat," seasonal industries, soft goods indus-
tries, service industries and entertainment industries,
were hard hit. The percentage of ineligible Workers in
Women’s coats and suits jumped from 12 to 21%; from
11 to 17% in Women’s dresses; from 33 to 45% in can-
neries ; from 17 to 24% in laundries; and from 36 to 52%
in seasonal hotels.

How THE LAW IS STACKED AGAINST
THE womuans

This 20-week requirement is a vicious restriction on the
worker’s right to take out of ,the Insurance Fund what
he put into it during his employment; it is, in fact, a ruse
to rob him of his rightful beneﬁts and should be imme-
diately repealed.

Workers are “disqualiﬁed” if they strike, if they are
locked out, if they quit their job without “good cause”
—a convenient gimmick for employers who determine
what is “good” or “bad”—or if they are ﬁred for “mis-
conduct.” They are “disqualiﬁed” if they refuse to accept
a job proffered by the State Employment Service, with-
out “good cause.” Experience has shown that workers
who reject a job below union scales, who insist on em-
ployment opportunities in their own skilled trade or union-
ized industry, who have experience and education in
crafts but are offered menial low-paying employment, are
often turned down for jobless beneﬁts. I

This is particularly true in the case of Negro workers
who become unemployed. The unemployment service

' systematically operates to force Negro workers who have

obtained skilled, semi-skilled or oﬂice worker jobs back
into menial, unskilled and domestic labor.

As if this wasn’t enough, the state allows employers
under’ the Hughes-Brees Law to ﬁght workers’ claims
to beneﬁts. Every time the employer blocks eligibility for
payments he is given a “credit” which under the merit-
rating system permits him to cut his tax into the Unem-
ployment Insurance Fund.

Few more shocking and reactionary statutes have ever
been devised.

In New York State in 1947 the number of workers
disqualiﬁed for unemployment insurance was 30% of
the average number of those who were registered for job-
less beneﬁts; by 1950 the disqualiﬁcations had zoomed

7

   

to 74% of the total and by 1953 to over 90%-—an almost
unbelievable display of rampant “let-’em-eat-cake” phi-
losophy.

Unemployment is getting worse and oﬁicials are tough-
ening up their “weeding out” policy towards jobless
claimants. During the ﬁrst two months of 1954, 17 1/8%
of all “original claims” were dumped in the waste basket
as invalid as against 12.9% for the same months of 1953.
That’s the trend.

Besides disqualiﬁcations, the 26-week limit on pay-
ments is another cause for lost unemployment beneﬁts.
Some 1,600,000 beneﬁt weeks “disappeared” in 1950 be-
cause of this, says the State Department of Labor. With
unemployment again on the upswing, the CIO recom-
mendation to expand jobless beneﬁts to 39 weeks becomes
a matter for swift enactment.

LEVEL OF BENEFITS

So you say, all right, those things are bad. But some,
even most unemployed workers, sooner or later do get
beneﬁts, don’t they? Aren’t they adequate? Let’s see.

The average New York State beneﬁt in 1953 was $26.68
per week for total unemployment. The average weekly
wage of employed workers covered by insurance was about
$75. Enough said. Well, you might argue that one can’t
expect to receive in jobless aid the same as for employ-
ment. No, we don’t. But wedo expect a stable norm,
or at least a stability in payments which reﬁects the
period of payments. Not a drop to one-third of normal
wages from the 40% of wages in unemployment bene-
ﬁts paid during the 1945-49 period.

The increase in beneﬁts has fall-en far short of the
price rise. Since 1945 average beneﬁt payments have
gone up 37% while the price index shows a 50% in-
crease.

The President's Economic Report—despite inadequa-'

8

 

 

cies and concessions to Big Business——was forced to pro-
pose that job beneﬁts “equal atleast half their regular
earnings.”

In New York State this would require raising maxi-
mums from the present $30 weekly to $40 a week in bene-
ﬁts, and would merely restore the 50% principle estab-
lished in pre-war social security regulations.

' The CIO proposes raising beneﬁts to an average of
65% of average earnings, plus allowances to dependents
——-providing an increase in beneﬁts to an average of $50.

Inadequate beneﬁts plus wholesale exclusions from
payments have made a farce of unemployment insurance.
Today jobless workers as a group receive less than one-
sixth of the wages they normally get when working.

Fortunately, up to now at least one member of the
family usually has been working to tide over a kin’s un-
employment, or, there was some saving backlog. All this
is disappearing. If unemployment continues, some radical
change in the unemployment insurance laws would be
necessary—fast.

MERIT-RATING AND THE FINANCIAL
STABILITY OF THE FUND

Since 1952 the Unemployment Insurance System has
been operating under a so-called “merit-rating” plan. Un-
der this system ﬁrms with stable payrolls or employment
pay a lower tax rate into the Insurance Fund. Seasonal
employers and those ﬁrms with less stable employment
pay a higher tax rate. Since the “stable” ﬁrms are the
huge concerns (utilities, monopolies and big establish-
ments, as a rule), We ﬁnd that Big Business is getting
away with a small tax rate while the smaller employer,
the one least able to control market conditions and his
employment, pays a higher rate.

The tax rate on all employers fell from 2.7% of pay-
rolls in 1951 to 2.05% in 1953 and total employer collec-
