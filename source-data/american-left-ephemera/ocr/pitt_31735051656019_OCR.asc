making political judgments and the means for making those judg-
ments effective in public affairs.

4. Freedom of travel, both internally and abroad, for Soviet citi—

zens; and of travel by foreigners in Russia.

.5. Free exchange of ideas, importation .of foreign newspapers,

scientiﬁc and cultural journals, etc.

6. Drastic measures against the evil of burocracy and the develop-
ment of a privileged, exploiting group, with the regime based on that
rather than on the people or masses. This, of course, is not a problem
which bedevils Russia alone.

7. Efforts to curb the trend toward extreme centralization and the
re—introduction of some form of actual workers’ and peasants’ control
such as the original soviets were supposed to provide. .

8. Adjustment of relations between the Soviet Union and th
so—called satellite countries in such a way that there is no question
that they are free to determine their own destinies.

C. What is ahead?

The thesis of the labor and socialist movement in earlier times was
that the general well—being of the masses of men, in freedom, peace
and a fraternal world, would be achieved by the world—wide triumph
of democratic socialism. This would eliminate all forms of feudal and
capitalist exploitation and other means by which men were dehuman-
ized. .In general terms—and recognizing that we are painting with
broad strokes—this is still the means to the goal we seek. More
concretely:

1. If democratic socialism is to be established in Russia it will
have to be by the will and action of the Russian people themselves.
Any form of U.S. intervention in Russia (or other Communist lands)
must be opposed. Such intervention, moreover, could not serve any
rational American interest. If it takes the form of a threat to Russian
security by the U.S. atomic arsenal, this will serve to solidify the
Russian people behind any regime that will oppose such intervention.
If the matter is pressed, therefore, the result can only be the nuclear
war which we are anxious to avoid. It should by now be Clear anyway
that neither our own allies, such as France and Great Britain, nor the
uncommitted nations will give the United States any support for any-

8

thing that remotely resembles aggressive action against Russia and
China. In such an effort, An1erica’s allies could be found only among
reactionary regimes.

Presumably there will be elements in the United States who will be
tempted to stir up revolt against Communist regimes in the satellite
lands or in Russia itself, engaging in the promotion of. sabotage and
providing arms to rebels. This is playing with ﬁre, for a number of
reasons. It means using the same methods for which we constantly
condemn the Communists. Violent counterrevolutions in Communist
lands would probably turn into horrible bloodbaths. We shall not get
help for this sort of thing, except from right—wing reactionaries, such
as Franco and former Nazis. The likelihood is very great that general

T war would result if such attempts at subversion from without were

fairly successful—-—which is unlikely. After the recent revelations, it is
no longer valid to argue that violent means of one or another kind are
indispensable in order to show the Russians that “their totalitarian
Overlords” are not infallible.

2. Democratic socialism will be achieved by the will and action
of the Russian people only if they receive the right kind of democratic
socialist support from without. The classic view that socialism is
inherently international, a world concept and movement, was and is
correct. Recent developments, including the Poznan revolt in Poland,
make this fact very clear. When the threat of imminent war has been
lifted and controls are therefore somewhat relaxed, the workers and
intellectuals in totalitarian lands assert themselves and a democratic
movement begins to stir. Therefore, socialists and progressives every-
where must help, and can best help, the peaceful revolution towards
democracy in Russia by resolutely opposing War. Coexistence as an
element in the process of radical social change ( which is not the same
as the “coexistence” that governmentstalk about and which they
advocate as a means of preventing social change) in every country so
far as possible, is one basic factor in the struggle for peace and democ-
racy in and outside of Russia.

3. The above is facilitated by the emergence of a “third group-

ing,” the in—between nations, such as India, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia,
and the trend toward what is often called “neutralism.” These “in-

between” nations, as well as most if not all of the West European

allies of the United States, elements in the Soviet satellite countries,

9

the people of West Germany and of Japan, have shown an increasing
disposition to make it plain that they cannot be counted upon for
support in a nuclear war. This fact, together with their determined
efforts to keep or get out of either dominant power bloc, has already
had a salutary effect on both Russia and the United States. It is a
very important factor in the relaxation of tension which marks the
present period. The less polarization of power in two blocs, and the
larger the group of nations following an independent course, the less
is the likelihood that the war danger will crop up. Therefore, genuine
“third campism” must be encouraged. Speciﬁcally, it would be an
immense advance if West Germany, together with East Germany
and the present Russian satellites, and presently all of western Europe
were “neutralized.” (It is signiﬁcant that such men as George F.
Kennan and A. A. Berle are beginning to suggest such" a course.)

From the standpoint of our present survey, the in—between coun-
tries exhibit two characteristics of great signiﬁcance: 1) They either
are no longer or not yet formidable military powers; they need and
mainly want to cut military expenditures drastically, or to keep them
at a minimum. 2) Essentially, they are trying—and have to try—to
develop something that can best be called democratic socialism. They
do not want either totalitarian collectivism or American—style “free
enterprise” capitalism.
4. Given Democratic Socialist support from without, can Russia
(and China) move by essentially peaceful process toward democratic
socialism?

To assume that this is certain or relatively easy would be a grave
mistake:

a. The regime is strongly entrenched, has made progress despite its
errors, represents a victorious and powerful country, and represents also
immense vested. interests in material advantages, prestige and power.

b. Russia is a heavily militarized nation—state with an immense
dynamism. It would be fatuous to assume that it can easily change its
nature.

c. The international Communist movement is also, despite the pres-
ent crisis, numerically powerful, organizationally well equipped, and
accustomed to iron discipline. The possibility that any substantial
democratization would destroy the old Communist “mystique” and
hence threaten the movement with collapse and that therefore any
such tendency will be resisted to the death, cannot be excluded.

1O

Nevertheless, I think the possibility cannot be dismissed that the
process of democratization and radical social change——something like
the realization of the original ideal—may yet take place.

Before mentioning some of the reasons for this provisional opti-
mism, it needs to be said as emphatically as possible that there is
no chance of achieving this result if socialists, paciﬁsts and other men
of good will mistake appearances for realities, words for deeds. The
people who today can command a certain conﬁdence and authority
are those who refuse-d, during the rise of Stalin, touse a double
standard of political morality, who repudiated terror and totalitarian-
ism, who did not shut their eyes or silence their voices about the
Stalinist abominations—but who also did not, for example, join the
ranks of red-baiters or support Capitalist wars. These people must not
now dissipate whatever inﬂuence or moral authority they may have by
accepting sham or truncated democratization for the real thing.

5. Among the reasons, then, for a cautious optimism are:

a. It will not be easy to allay or crush the ferment that has arisen.
If Khrushchev and his colleagues do not carry their analysis further than
they have and if they fail to make good on their promises, they will
presently be forced to throw overboard their recent policies and try to
revert to the Stalinist pattern of domestic repression and international
bluster. But if they attempt this, they will almost certainly be thrown
out or kill each other off, as Stalin did the “Old Bolsheviks.” In foreign
affairs, they would risk war, which would also ruin them. There are, in
other words, vast inducements today for them to “keep the peace.”
Conceivably men in such circumstances might step aside for new lead-
ers rather than face the only alternative in sight. It may be as hard to go
back as to go forward in a situation where either means rough going!

b. It must not be overlooked that, in spite of the abominable wicked-
ness and the egregious errors of the Stalin regime, the Soviet Union and
the Communist movement have registered tremendous achievements.
On the one hand, this means that the present leaders have elbow room
in which to maneuver: the nation and regime do not have to ﬁght for
mere survival. The situation is relaxed compared to the past. On the
other hand, there is the fact that in some respects the basis for a new
order has been laid. As indicated above, the Soviet Union is far
from being a democratic socialist country. Nevertheless, feudalism and
private capitalism have been overthrown. Great economic strides have
been made, and admittedly much greater ones are imminent.*

* The question as to what the Soviet regime is or is not, is one which needs

11

c. The chance for a reorganization and revitalizing of the world
socialist and labor movement seems to be greater now than at any time
since 1919. For example, the Asian and African socialist and labor
movements are formidable and growing. They are not prepared to sue-
cumb to totalitarianism, but they are also critical of west European
socialism. They cannot be ignored. Labor and socialist movements in
western Europe" have also comerto a turning point. They have failed to
hammer out a united policy. They will soon have to do so or else sue-
cumb either to reactionary forces or to the Communists. Thirdly, with
the present self-critical attitude in the CPS, the collapse of the Stalin
myth, and the open admission that there are various roads to Socialism,
the possibility of healing the split between Socialists and Communists
emerges for the ﬁrst time since 1919. As Flora Lewis said, in a slightly
different context, in The New York Times Magazine, June 25, 1956:
“The new atmosphere brings the ﬁrst glimmer of hope for which the
world has waited for so long. It is no more yet than a thin hope, far
from a promise, but it is real.” In so far as a united world socialist and
labor movement does materialize, it will serve, on the one hand, to
bring pressure on dishonest and recalcitrant elements in the CPSU and,
on the other hand, to encourage and support all elements working for
democratization.

THE OUTLOOK IN THE U.S.A.

SPACE does not permit elaborating the point that the major parties
in the United States do not have a program todeal with the
problems we have outlined and in a real sense the point does not
require elaboration. The minor parties are nearly all fragmented parts
of a barely existent socialist movement. Even their paper programs,
as in the ease of the SP, are defective. Apart from such considerations,
however, they have no role, except that of propaganda or educational
agencies, and fairly weak ones at that. (All this goes pretty much for
the CPUSA also.) If there is to be effective political action, we
patently need a new political instrument.* T
Until recently I felt that it was unrealistic to talk about such an

plenty of discussion. In an article on “The Allure of Communism” in LIBERATION,
August 1956, I have dealt with some aspects of the matter, pointing out that the
growth of Communism and its hold on multitudes of the most dynamic people
of our time implies, on the one hand, that it has some positive elements of
strength and, on the other hand, that it reflects the frightful weakness of the
opposition offered by western democratic forces.

* See on this point the “Statement on the Presidential Election” by the Editors A

in LIBERATION, October 1956.

12

instrument and that a general democratic and socialist educational
effort, together with ad hoc action for civil liberties, against segrega-
tion, etc., was all that could be done. The developments dealt with
in this paper have led me in recent weeks to change my mind to an
appreciable extent. Not to go overboard, I suggest that it is time to
begin talking seriously about the possibility of working toward the
formation of a democratic socialist “party” or “movement” and about
steps which might be taken toward this end. I think conditions are
decidedly more favorable now than they were six months ago.

Before mentioning some of these conditions, two parenthetical
observations are in order: 1) Political action is for me a broad term,
which includes, for example, labor struggles and such developments
as are taking place in Montgomery, and which is not focused mainly
on voting in 'a presidential election once in four years. 2) I am not
going into questions about a “broad labor party," or the Democratic
or Republican party as “the lesser evil,” though some questions of
this kind are important.

Favoring the development of a democratic and broadly socialist
movement in the United States are such factors as the following:

1. Though I am not in general an optimist about the “state of
the nation” and the prevailing U.S. culture, I am impressed by some
points made by Harry Braverman in an article on “The New America”
in the July 1956 issue of The American Socialist. Braverman contends
that the existence of a much more powerful labor union movement
in the U.S. than was the case, for example, in the Thirties, is an
advantage, despite the obvious shortcomings of the AFL-CIO. He
also points out that there is in the country generally “a considerable
and growing body of humanism, toleration, sophistication, cosmopoli-
tanism and a general spread of a more mature mood and approach.”
It seems clear also that the tradition of democracy is more deeply
ingrained than some thought a few years ago, and this despite the
setbacks that have occurred and under which we still live.

2. The upsurge of the Negro people, as illustrated in Montgomery
and elsewhere, is potentially a major factor. Political action in the
sense of the right to vote, etc., is of immense importance to them and
they are preoccupied with debates about voting Republican or Demo-
cratic, but they and their leaders are increasingly aware that they get
nowhere winh these parties.

13f

3. The continued dependence of the U.S. economy on war pro-
duction, conditions in Detroit and a number of other cities-—and
strikes such as in steel recently—suggest cracks in the economy and
the likelihood that organized labor may have to reconsider its political
strategy before long and that the question of an alternative to “free
enterprise” may have to’ be raised.

4. Developments on the international scene, particularly repeated
setbacks in U.S. foreign policy, suggest that the United States may
before long have to adopt a radically new foreign policy or else be
forced increasingly into isolation, which would lead to an economic
crisis or a war crisis, perhaps both. Labor and other elements will
certainly in this case be forced to seek an alternative, and in the end
there is none except a socialist one.

5. The fact that U.S. “private enterprise” and monopoly capi-
talism cannot be exported and that the new nations coming up often
turn to some kind of socialism, will also tend to revive interest in
socialism among many people here.

6. The new developments in the CP, suggesting at least the possi-
bility of the healing or dissipation of the split in labor and progressive
forces, is likewise a favorable factor.

Next Steps and Orientation
For purposes of discussion I note the following:
1. Exchange of opinion on these matters among individuals and
groups should be encouraged and initiated by anyone so disposed.
Means to publish contributions to the discussion should be sought.

2. Merger. of existing parties and groups should not be stressed at
this moment. It may be doubted whether a viable socialist or labor
party could, in any event, be started in that way. At present, cer-
tainly, a merger of splinters would not impress anyone or engender
any power of attraction. If conditions were ripe for a genuine fusion
of several existing groups, the same conditions would permit the
emergence of something much more substantial than that. Further-
more, in any political development now, the question of the CP has
to be faced: what becomes of the party, its members and sympathizers,
and——what attitude is to be taken toward them. Any merger based on
an evasion or postponement of that issue will, in my opinion, prove

14

unsubstantial and abortive. (This is not intended to prejudge the
question of what is going to happen in and to the CP.)

3. “United action” or “united fronts” should not be pressed at
this juncture. This is not to underestimate or suggest postponing
until the millennium united action among elements as broad as pos-
sible for all sorts of objectives. But if anything is clear, it is that within
every group the need for fresh thinking and clariﬁcation is paramount.
Moreover, there is at present no mutual conﬁdence on which to build
such action. The whole problem of what constitutes elementary
decency in relations among radical and progressive elements and of
the relation between ends and means requires the most serious con-
sideration. To undertake “united action” at this stage would simply
mean indirectly committing people politically. In the absence of
much clariﬁcation such commitment would be premature and would
constitute an obstacle to progress. In the meantime, there is nothing
to prevent parallel action and the establishment of personal contacts
among people who have too long conversed only with those living
inside their own corral.

4. This means essentially that discussion at this stage would in—
vo’lve individuals rather than organizations as such. In such discussion,
people from all groups and parties would be involved, as well as
unattached individuals. The only exception would be people who
started out with the idea that the party or group to which they
belonged had all the answers and the “right” program, and whose
object was simply to get everybody else to join that party or group.
There should obviously be no attempt to interfere with anybody’s
effort at recruiting, but the discussions now envisioned would not be
the place for that. I do not, on the other hand, assume that people
will come with minds empty of ideas and convictions, which would
also be decidedly unhelpful. ,

Since the question of procedure for particular discussions has come
up, I venture to state my own approach to this question. It does not
seem to me that “democracy” requires that participants from all
groups should be included in every meeting, whether public or pri-
vate. Any given combination of panelists may conceivably be useful
for a given meeting. What should be clear is that neither the CP nor
any other group can rightly evade public debate with members of
another gro‘up who have a distinctive position and who want to

Is

discuss issues in a spirit which provides for hard—hitting intellectual
presentation but excludes rancor and personal vituperation.

I surmise that, in addition to a variety of public discussions, private
and in the ﬁrst instance completely “0ff—the—record” conferences
among individuals on the future of socialism in this country may
be in order.

5. It will be impossible and undesirable to avoid all discussion of
the past and of controversies between Socialists and Communists,
various factions of Communists, and the like. The last thing I believe
in is a movement that lacks clarity as to its philosophy, its ethic, pro-
gram and goal. But our problem is with the present and the ‘future.
Americans of the generation that did not reach the age of eighteen
until 1940 or later would, I am sure, be unuatterably bored by any
discussion or program focused basically on what happened in Russia
in the Thirties. ‘

Wlrat are the issues which mankind now faces? What are the real
battle—lines today? What kind of society do we want to achieve? It is
such questions as these that we should face seriously and in a spirit
free from dogmatism.

WHERE ARE
WE NOW?

AMERICAN RADICALISM AND THE IMPACT OF
RECENT SOVIET DEVELOPMENTS

by A. J. Muste

E ARE MANIFESTLY living in a transition period, quite
Wpossibly leading to the greatest changes that have ever occurred

in man’s history. It is important to attempt to get some sort of
coherent picture of the situation and the trends, though to a con-
siderable extent there are no precedents to guide us and we are prob—
ably unable to foresee what the future of mankind will be like.

The dominant factors in the situation today are:

1. The fact that technologically we live in the opening years of
the atomic age. On the one hand, this opens vistas of material well—
being and comfort for the masses. On the other hand, it breaks up old
ways of living and leads to continuous social change. It raises grave
problems as to what man himself will be like and widespread ques-
tioning as to the “meaning” of life.

2. The H—bon1b——more speciﬁcally, the fact that mankind now has
the means to destroy itself and put an end to its history, with all
the tensions this suggests. For the time being, however, there is a
nuclear military stalemate, the existence of which was registered at
Geneva in July 1955.

3. The upsurge of the peoples in so-called underdeveloped coun-
tries and the radical transformation of life in Asia, Africa and Latin
America as a result of these popular revolutions. One aspect of this
development which has an important bearing on international rela-

[ll

tions is the rapid increase in the signiﬁcance of the countries in this
third grouping, the “nations in—between” the two dominant power
states or blocs.

4. The Communist revolution of 1917 in Russia and the subse-
quent spread of Communism. More recently the “crisis” in Soviet
Russia and the world Communist movement symbolized by the
desanctiﬁcation of Stalin at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU
in February 1956.

One important result of the existence of these factors is a decided
relaxation of international tension, in the sense that general war,
which would inevitably become nuclear, is a good deal less likely than
it was in the 1948-54 period. The powers that could decide the issue
are for the time being resolved not to embark on such a war. For the
present this also tends to make limited wars, except of the kind going
on in Algeria, less likely, since any war involving two or more nations
is likely to become general. While, on the one hand, the big powers
will in one way or another contribute to the tension in the Middle
East, for example, they will also strive not to let the situation get out
of hand. This elimination of the threat of nuclear catastrophe, for
the present and the immediate future, is of decisive importance for
any evaluation of the contemporary situation and any program based
upon it.

RATTITUDE OF SOVIET GOVERNMENT

NCREASINGLY in the post—Stalin period it is less frowning and
“aggressive.” (The term as used here is not meant to convey the
idea that the Soviet regime has been more aggressive than that of
the U.S., for example. This is a matter which does not need to be
discussed at this point. The author’s view, in general, is that any
heavily armed power state regards itself as engaged in defense and is
actually aggressive as over against any rival.) Among the reasons are
these:

1. Russia is faced with serious internal problems, among them an
agricultural situation hindered by technological backwardness and a
shortage of farm labor due to the low birthrate during the war years.
(This situation now seems to me more serious than I realized until
recently and hence more of a factor in forcing the Kremlin to follow

2

a “peace” policy.) It seems likely, too, that Communist China’s need
of time for industrialization accounts to a large extent for the modera-
tion in its foreign relations in the past year.

2. A “crisis” has occurred in the CPSU and as a result in the
CPS throughout the world, and especially in the satellite countries.
Among other causes for this is the fact that the extreme pressure on
the populations to produce for the military establishment could not
be sustained.

3. From another angle, the “sweetness and light” policy has so
far produced such good results in promoting “neutralism,” and the
Soviet power position is in general so favorable, that there would be
no sense in substituting a military emphasis for it at this stage.

ATTITUDE OF U.S. AND WEST

IN THESE countries also the prevailing tendency is to de—emphasize
(relatively speaking) military means and emphasize economic,
political and cultural policies instead. Among the reasons for this:

1. The fear of Russian aggression has lessened and the chance to
relax, to cut down somewhat on their military budgets, etc., are
welcome in all NATO countries, outside the United States.

2. Great Britain and France are empires in retreat and are forced
to cut down on military commitments.

3. Western Europe has not solved its economic problems, and the
strength of the Communist Party in such countries as France and
Italy militates against any policy which seems directed against Russia.

4. The U.S. has not evolved a foreign policy adapted to the post-
Stalin era and the new importance of the “in—between” countries
(“r1eutralism” etc.) and is therefore unable to provide leadership for
NATO countries which might offset tendencies toward weakening or
even disintegration.

5. The “mood” of the American people is clearly also one in favor
of “moderation,” a wish to be free from the tensions of the Korean
war, the cold war, McCarthyism, etc. In a sense they are as absorbed
in “prosperity,” and in exploring the technological frontier, as their
ancestors were in the physical conquest of the continent. Hence a
deﬁnite trend is manifest, of trying to cut down foreign commitments

3

and to concentrate on defending the “American bastion” (a la Robert
Taft).

6. So far as foreign policy goes, things tend to be in a state of
“suspended animation” here in any presidential election year. This
tendency is vastly heightened now by Eisenhower’s physical condition.

THE CRISIS IN THE SOVIET UNION
AND THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT

SUFFICIENT indication has been given in the preceding section of
the reasons for the crisis in the CPSU, as dramatically revealed
in the Twentieth Congress. (See also the article by A.  Muste in the
May issue of LIBERATIQN, ll0 Christopher St., New York 14, N. Y.)
First of all, we must now attempt to summarize what has already

taken place, what admissions have been made. Then we must.

similarly attempt to estimate in what respects the recent events in
Russia and the Communist movement fall short of what is needed
for the achievement of something like a genuinely democratic setup.
Thirdly, we must seek to arrive at some idea of future developments,
what alternatives are going to be presented, and what, therefore,
is a sound program for us to adopt.

A. What Has Happened So Far?

As I have more than once pointed out, we must not jump to hasty
conclusions about the leopard changing his spots. It is, however, at
least equally dangerous to minimize what has happened and to under-
estimate the forces which have been set in motion.

1. Under Stalin, it is now proclaimed by Khrushchev and other
Soviet leaders, the Soviet regime perpetrated grave evils and egregious
errors. These errors and wrongs were unjustiﬁed. They included:

a. Abrogation of even Soviet legality, rule by terror, etc. It is true
that Khrushchev elaborates on the barbarous execution of Communists
and CP leaders, mainly if not exclusively in the period from 1934 on,
but he has so far not made similarly clear statements about persecution
of other people such as the Jews. Certainly more needs to be cleared up
about such matters. We may, however, surmise that Soviet citizens are
not unaware that millions were subjected to Stalin’s barbarism and that
Khrushchev himself knows that they know.

b. During the war, various national groups were liquidated or de-
ported in barbarous fashion. a

c_. The nation itself was imperiled by political and military mistakes.

cl. Fundamental errors were made in the interpretation of Marxist
theory—such as the idea that the closer the regime came to achieving
socialism, the more intense the class conﬂict became, the more danger-
ous its enemies. Another admittedly basic error was the banning of
Tito and Communist Yugoslavia from the Cominform, based on the
view that there was only “one road to socialism” and that Moscow
alone knew what it was and could lead the world to it. Still another, of
course, is the “cult of personality” business. The doctrine that war is
inevitable as long as imperialism lasts was formally repudiated at the
Twentieth Congress of the CPSU; and it is suggested that the transi-
tion to socialism may normally be a peaceful one, the implication being
that the emphasis on violent seizure of power as indispensable was
erroneous.

2. A number of policies have been initiated in an eﬂort to correct
a the Stalinist errors. For example:

a. Relaxation of restrictions on civil liberties; gradual elimination
of slave labor camps; amnesty for considerable numbers of political
prisoners; more freedom to change jobs, to travel, etc.

b. Greater efforts to supply the demand for consumer goods, though
industrialization and development of the military establishment are
still major objectives.

c. Admission that there can be differences among CPs and various
“roads to socialism”—as exempliﬁed in the Tito case. Iust what is to
be the relation of the CPSU to other CPs remains to be worked out,
but it is not what it was under Stalin. .

d. Attempts to develop “collective leadership,” to increase participa-
tion of party members in discussion of policy, and to take measures to
release the “creative energies” of the people generally.

e. Modiﬁcations in foreign policy as already noted.

3. So far there is a strong effort (displayed in the reply of the
Central Committee of the CPSU on June 30, 1956, to Togliatti and
other critics) to make Stalin the sole scapegoat for this enormous
amount of evil and error. This is itself an instance of Stalinist method-
ology and spirit which must be exposed. But we must not permit this
point to obscure other aspects of the picture.

It is understandable that Soviet leaders, who in any case were
accomplices of Stalin, and who are faced with unrest and dissatis-
faction of various kinds, should start out by confessing Stalin’s sins

5

rather than their own. What is politically important is:

a. The aura of infallibility which surrounded the leaders of the
CPSU—Stalin, of course, in particular—has been dispelled. They will
not be able to restore it, at least in its old form; if Stalin could make
mistakes, why not Khrushchev? The latter and his colleagues are on the
defensive; they have to “make explanations” in a way Stalin did not.

b. The process of change and adjustment has°been set in motion in
the top echelons of the Soviet regime. Probably no one knows precisely
what the nature of the power struggle among individuals may be, nor
how it will end. But things are in motion. More “revelations” are bound
to come. They have made it all but impossible to restore the old one-
man dictatorship pattern in the present period.

c. The questions as to the connection between the Soviet regime
itself (and even Marxism-Leninism) and Stalinism, which have been
raised by various CPS including the Communist Party USA will not be
silenced by such statements as the Iune 30 announcement of the
Central Committee of the CPSU. You cannot repudiate the “cult of
personality” on the one hand, and then turn around and use the diabolic
character of one person as the explanation of everything that went
wrong for 25 years, including the near-extinction of the regime at the
hands of Hitler! The line that the man who yesterday was the fount
of all good has turned out to be the source and explanation of all that
was evil in the past is patently not good enough. Khrushchev himself
must know that, maybe better than most!

A new generation of Russian youth is demanding and getting
education. An obviously deep ferment has been evoked, notably
among the Polish Communists. In this context, can the present
leaders guarantee to themselves that events dating back to 1934—
but not before——may be re—examined; that the cult of Stalin may be
subjected to Marxist criticism—but that the cult of Lenin may not
even be questioned? It does not seem likely.

Moreover, there are some doctrinal revisions which still remain
essentially on the verbal level. Thus, the promise that civil liberties
will be greatly extended may conceivably, so long as the government
is essentially a dictatorship, not be carried out. It may be argued that
the momentary insistence on the peaceful transition to socialism is
essentially for propaganda purposes and will prove temporary indeed.
But, to cite one instance, the pilgrimage of Bulganin and Khrushchev
to Belgrade to make peace with Tito, rather than Tito imploring
Moscow for mercy, the recognition that Titoism is orthodox Lenin-

ism, and the related developments—these are events on the place of
political reality, not verbalisms. These things cannot be removed from

history. They have their own logic and will operate according to it.*'

B. What Has Not Yet Happened

The present Soviet leaders assert that Russia has achieved socialism.

The claim that it has achieved anything which can fairly be called
democratic socialism, and indeed that this happened quite a few years
ago, is, by their own recent statements about Stalinism, preposterous.
Among the things we would have to see before we could agree that
the Soviet regime was a democratic socialist one are these:
1. Restoration of full civil liberties. There must be the same right
for people in the Soviet Union to advocate radical revolutionary views
—as distinct from action to overthrow the regime by violence—as we
insist must be accorded to Communists to advocate Communism in
the United States. The fact that, in practice, they are too often denied
it in the United States simply means that there is a struggle to be
waged here as in the Soviet Union: it does not constitute a justiﬁca-
tion for curtailing civil liberties in the latter.

2. Genuine freedom for union organizations to ﬁght for the rights
of workers and granting them the right to strike.

3. Provision for genuine and organized expression of dissent. I
ﬁnd it diﬁicult to say whether this does or does not mean a two- or
multiple-party system such as those found in western parliamentarian-
ism. Certainly if people want to organize an opposition political party
they must be permitted to do so, for otherwise they are denied their
civil right to organized dissent. It may also be that if there were
organized dissent within a nominally one—party setup, this would
mean that in fact there were two parties. On the other hand, I have
enough doubts about contemporary forms of political organization to
react with considerable enthusiasm to the question recently put by
another writer on this whole subject: “Couldn’t there be . . . an
evolution toward a no—party system with novel forms of political
representation and expression?” What is crucial and absolutely indis-
pensable is that the people should have the right and the habit of

still other tters relevant to this discussion in the article “Whither Communist
Russia?” in LIBERATION, May 1956.
