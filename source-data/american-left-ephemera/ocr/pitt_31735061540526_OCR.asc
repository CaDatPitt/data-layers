Whal is more. if used lo be lhaf eachman wi’rh lhe help of
his family grew his own food. wove his own clofhes, and builf

:3 WHY PEOPLE CANNOT TRADE

I. More Machines, Less Jobs

The ﬁrsf reason’ why people cannol ’rra/de all their goods
and services is because some people who have only services
fo exchange are no’r allowed +0 exchange ’rhem‘.

Machinery is invenfed which does ’rheir work be’r’rer and
L more quickly, and ’rhey are fold ’rhey are no longer needed.
23

 
 

    

   

 

 

This picfureishows how much work some of rhese machines 
A can do, and how many workers fhey can displace. 9. .9 K,
We ough’r”ro be grafeful +0 fhe engineers who invenfed

’rhlese,wonden°ul labor—saving machines. Buf are fhese machines
ins1’alled' fo lighfen men's work and give fhem a chance ’ro
gel more ouf of life?‘No’r a’r all. They are put in ’ro cu’r ’rhe
cos? of making fhe product so as re make more money
when if is sold. _ 9

For insfance, in I929 four dollars had ‘to be paid {or fhe
making of one aufomobile door. Today ﬁffeen cen’rs is all if
cos’rs for fhe same work. The wages paid for body-framing used
‘to be fhree dollars‘. The presem‘ cos’r is +hir+y-ﬁve«cen’rs. Hand-

ﬁnishing fhe body-frames of wood before paneling used +0  ll

cosf fhree dollars. Now if cosfs only +wen’ry cenfs.
But you say. fhese machines cosf a lo’r of money. The

manufac’rurers’canno’r afford fo pay for machinery and men.'. 

foo. They do cos+ a low‘ of money, and fhai is ’rhe reason
why only fhe rich corporaiions can afford ’ro have fhem. Thaf
gives ’rhern ihe advanfage over fhe smaller businesses. because

T This chart shows how much people‘have saved. You see the

man at the top spent only a littlemore than a quarter of his

a income. But even the man at the bottom managed to save 5%

of his wages. Notice that the people with incomes less than

 $25,000 saved just as much as those with incomes over $25,000.

People save because they are afraid of tomorrow. next year.
‘ten years from now. twenty years from now. They fear
unemployment, failure. sickness. old age. In the present system
all are victims of the same insecu,ri‘ry-——‘rhe wage—earner, the

L professional man, the owner ot a business. They all ‘try ‘to get

ready for the rainy day.

What did they do with their savings during the years of
prosperity? What did you do with yours? Perhaps you put
them in a sock and hid ‘them, or you rented a lock-box at
the bank. The chances are. however,,‘that you didn't. because
you had heard someone say. "Let your dollars work for you."
So you put ‘them in a savings bank or in life insurance. or into
stocks and bonds. lt you gave them to your bank or your life
insurance company. they turned around and invested them

for you. s

 

Now the scheme has been that savings ‘turned into investments‘

built new factories. This meant the buying of building material.
the hiring of men. the paying of wages. andithe purchase of
new machinery. ln this way ‘the money got back into ‘the hands
of ‘those who would spend it. and thus the exchange of goods
and services was completed. This idea worked fairly well as

"T6. How Debi’: Grow

Savings do more fhan slop The exchange of goods. They

lcrea’re debfs. Whenever money is loaned by one person. if

becomes a debl for someone else. The las’r picfures showed

how_ people saved. and iwhaf became of ‘their savings. This
T _pic’rure showshow our deb’rs have grown; A T

The savings of people helped ’rhe governmenf finance rho

 war. See how ’rhe governmem‘ debf increased in l9l8 and '

|9l9. We are slill carrying‘ ’rhe burden of ’rha’r debf in our faxes.
The farmers borrowed money fo buy more land and new

. machinery. Their debfs increased |00% befween l9l4 and

l9|9. During fhe same years lhe amounf of fheir‘ producfs

g increased only 8%. .

Also, savings found lheir way info business and became debls
for corporaﬁons and individuals. These business debis grew as
rapidly as savings and bolh grew much fasfer ’rhan ihe naﬁonal
income. L

But fhe man or ’rhe company fhaf borrows money now‘ only
has ’ro pay back fhe loan. He mgusf pay more. The idea fhaf

we can le’r our dollars work for us has made us ’rhinl< fhaf

dollarslfhemselves can produce goods and ‘therefore deserve

HOW TOV USE OUR WEALTH

The Sysfom Does Nof Work _

The purpose. of any economic sys’rem is +5 ‘supply fhe Tl

necessiﬁes and as many comforts as possible ’ro all fhe people
who live under il. Our sysfem fails ’ro do ‘this. We have seen
why. People have no’r been able fo exchange fheir labor or
‘their goods for ’rhe labor and goods of o-fher people.iThis
exchange has been impossible largely because ’rhe medium of
exchange-—money—has become an end in ilself inslead of a
means ‘to an end. The manufacfurer makes clofh. now‘ to provide
people wi’rh clofhes. bu’r fo make money.

We mus’: again make if possible lo exchange labor and
goods.-ll can be done. if. inslead of producing goods for proﬁf.

’rha’r is. lo make money. we dis’rribu’re goods as a service. Money T i

will fhen be wha’r if once was, merely a mefhod of exchange.
The producﬁon and disfribuﬁon of goods for use would fhen
be ’rhe chief purpose of all ac’rivi’ry.

lf a complefe exchange of ‘goods and services is»’ro be rho ‘

lhings we need. Until a shorf lime ago our dollar represenfed
a cerfain amounf of gold. Bul few of us wanled lo buy gold.
We needed food and clofhing and coal and oil. We could
never be sure iusf how much of fhese fhings a dollar would . i‘;
buy. The nex’r char’r shows whaf ’rhe dollar did buy in differem‘
years. ln I I920 even if a man made high wages. his dollars
would buy lessiood fhan in some of ‘the ofher years. .

Year by year. as men speculafed in coﬁon. sleel. wheaf.

If such a medium of exchange were es’rablished——-money ’rha+

market and dealt in speculative issues of domestic and foreign
bonds. The banks were thinking of the proﬁts from these
transactions. not of the effects upon depositors or upon the
market. Here is proof that good private banking is bad public
business.‘ And it becomes worse public businessin the time of a

depression. When more money is needed by the consumer

and by industry in order to start the wheels moving again, the
bank withdraws its credit because it can see no chance of protit.
These principles of doing business have caused people to
lose conﬁdence in the private bankers. See how more and more
depositors have turned to the protection of the government
and -placed their money in Postal Savings.
A unified system of banking and credit operated by the
government would tend to do away with the business cycle

‘ and avoid the high cost of depressions. It would regulate the

flow of money. on the one hand. ﬁnancing the consumer to
enable him to buy goods. and on the other hand. providing

 pl capital ‘tor the extension of industry to meet the need. lt
would not be interested  profits. but in making possible the

complete exchange of goods and services:

_ ‘Such a government bank would save the people money by
eliminating the huge sums now paid to private “banks for

financing governrnent business.

4. Social Ownership of Power ‘

In at power age. it is not enough to own the credit agencies

and the natural resources. The government must also control L

the billions of energy horses whichltorm so large a part of our
natural wealth, so that they can be harnessed to serve the nation.

We are all dependent upon these energy horses in one way i

or another. _,

ln ourtcomplicated machine civilization electricity becomes
as important as water. It is almost as important as the air we
breathe. Let the electricity be shut ott in a city. and streets and
houses would be dark. Elevators and street-cars would stop

running. Many houses would be without heat and refrigeration,

and stoves for cooking. Anything as vital as this in the lives of
men. women. and children. should be distributed as a service
at the lowest possible cost. V L

Already we have tested the possibility of government owner-_

ship and operation ot light and power plants. Although most of

the power in the country is still furnished by private companies. —

thepublicly owned plants provide a yardstick by which we can
measure the rates and the etticiency ot the two methods. ln a

study of the entire country, the average rate of the privately i

any attempt of the government to regulate their activities. To
assure the production ot goods tor use. these industries must
be socially owned. - *
Such ownership would not disturb etticient organization. We
have seen various types ot government management. The Pan-
ama Railroad Company does not have to wait tor Acts ot
Congress before it can do business. lt is organized like any other
corporation. lts otticers are appointed because of their ability.
Its success is iudged on the basis ot service and economy. These

7 same standards would characterize the management of a uni-

tied, publicly owned. industrial system. Plans for such a system
would have to be worked out. but there are plenty ot scien-
titically trained minds available to make the plans.
There must also be a plan to organize the production of agri-
cultural products. and ensure a sutticient supply tor the entire
country. Such a plan would not restrict crops until that supply

A ‘had been provided. Farmers could still own their own terms and

grow their crops. but they would be guaranteed a ready market
and the security ot regular income from their labor. The social
control ot agriculture would help the tarmer to make the best
possible use of his land. to grow the most suitable ‘crops. and
to keep his soil tertile. Unsuitable land would be taken out ot

l_ cultivation. Trees would be planted to prevent floods and to

replace the forests that have been cut down.

This scientific use ot our land would mean the conservation
and tull development otour agricultural wealth in the interests
ot all our people and ot tuture generations.

6. Organizing fhe Transporfafion of Goods

We live in a very large counfry. Many of us live far away
from fhe farmer who grows wheaf or owns a dairy. Our food
musf be broughf fo us by frain or frucl< or boaf. The number
of miles fravelled by all fhe various fhings we eaf in an average

a ‘ dinner—vegefables, meaf, fruif. spices. bread. coffee. sugar-

would amounf fo more fhan fhe disfance around fhe world. We

musf be able fo communicafe easily and quickly wifh ofher parfs '

of fhe counfry by felephone or felegraph. by frain or fruck. by
airplane or sfeamship. Lef any fown or cify be cuf off from fhe
resf of fhe counfry, andfhe people would soon sfarve fo deafh.
This means fhaf all sysfems of communicafion and fransporfafion
should be organized for service and nof for profif.

Lef us fake fhe railroads as an example. The governmenf has
already sef up confrols fo ensure service fo every parf of fhe
counfry. Buf fhis is nof enough. Compefifive lines add fo frans4
porfafion cosfs. _The salaries of duplicafing sefs of personnel

increase rafes. The lack of a coordinafed plan makes for i 

inefficiency. .

During fhe war. fhe governmenf removed from office 400
railway presidenfs and execufives. All adverfising was eliminafed.
Terminals were puf fo ioinf use. Compefifive frain service for
