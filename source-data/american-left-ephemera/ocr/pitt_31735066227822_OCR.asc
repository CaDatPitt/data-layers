desegregation was in the best interests
of the entire community. (See letter
attached---Attachment A.) The mediating
committee immediately began carrying out
these requests. The chairman called to-
gether four leading Negro citizens, all
of whom were associated with the NAACP,
to explain the new policy and to ask for
suggestions toward implementation.
These said that they would be glad to
pass on to the Negro comunity the re-
quests of the store managers that
Negroes move slowly at first. At a
mass meeting of the NAACP on Thursday,
March 21, Negroes hailed the agreement
and were urged by their leaders to be
especially courteous and neat when they

ate at the lunch counters.
Results

Managers of the stores reported no
difficulty and no loss in sales follow-
ing the desegregation. They received a
few telephone calls complaining of the
action, and a few persons closed their
accounts. But they also received words

of commendation from.many white persons”

and some Negro customers expressed their

appreciation.

On the first day, reporters and cam-
eramen were on hand. Cameras were
hurriedly set up when two Negro men en-
tered the Kress cafeteria. But the whﬁe
patrons showed far more interest in the
newsmen than in the two Negroes, and
when one white woman asked about the ex»
citement and was informed that there
were Negroes in the cafeteria.line, she
remarked that.she thought they had alwqws
been served in that cafeteria. News-
paper accounts of the first few days of
desegregation reported that few Negroesv
sat at the lunch counters. The following
two incidents, reported by members of'ﬂm
mediating committee, illustrate the adi-
tude of some Negroes toward their use of
the facilities. A Negro shoeshiner was
asked if he had eaten at one of the de~
segregated counters yet. The reply was
that he would eat there only when he
could be properly dressed, not when he
was in his work clothes with shoe polish
on his hands. Five Negro youngsters
standing outside Wbolworth“s debated
whether they would rggygy be served if

they sat down. A member of the mediaﬁng

comittee who happened to be standing
near assured them that they would. He
suggested, however, that all five not
sit together. Two of the youths then

went in together, were served,_and when
they left the store the other three went

in.

The Future

An interracial comission has been
set up, with the executive director of
the Comunity welfare Council as its
chairman. Its purpose is to consider
quietly other types of desegregation.
Nbnagers of hotels, motels, and restau-
rants will be invited in to discuss with
the committee the possibility of desegre-
gating their facilities. Still one dif-
ficulty remains, however, in the comple-
tion of the desegregation of eating faci-
lities in those stores where Negroes are

invited to shop but are not allowed to

sit to eat: Joske‘s, the only large,

‘-and drug stores.

wmmmsmmtmtwmdmrmmtme

' to consider desegregation, did announce

the desegregation of its basement cafe-
teria facility at the end of the thirty-
day period. However, the store refused
to desegregate the more fashionable eat-
ing places on its first and second floors
arguing that its basement facility was
more comparable to the lunch counters and
cafeterias in the desegregated variety
The Negroes are not ‘
happy about this arrangement and have
talked in terms of sit—ins and boycotts
at Joske's. However, the white members
of the interracial committee are urging
the Negroes not to resort to overt demon-
strations for fear they might undo much
of what has been accomplished. Apparent-
ly a great deal of pressure is being
brought to bear on the moderate Negro
members of the committee by the more ag-
gressive Negroes. At the time of this
writing it is not clear how this issue

will be resolved.* But there is no ques-

tion about the ultimate goal of the Negro

* Subsequently,picketing in Joske's was begun, and one fight has occurred. It is
reported that the demonstration does not have the undivided support of the Negro

community.

At any rate, the demonstration is not regarded as a reversal of the

progress made; in fact, several places not a party to the first agreement have since
quietly desegregated.

 

leaders; it is to make San Antonio a completely "open" city.

Factors Contributing to Desegregation

The following factors were pointed out by San Antonians as being of importance
in bringing about lunch-counter desegregation:

(1) The presence and success of integration in the large military bases, and
in the public recreational facilities and schools, helped to show the city that
desegregation could "work."

(2) The large Latin-American population, about h2% of the total, feels less
prejudice toward the Negro than does the white. As one of the Negro leaders said
to the writer, "You know, the Latin-Americans accept us more readily than do you
whites." Furthermore, some of the Latin~Americans have dark skins, and whites
have grown accustomed to seeing them eating at the counters. Politically, the
Negroes hold the balance of power between the other two races, and some persons
interviewed suggested that this was a factor in bringing about desegregation.

(3) Channels of communication between Negroes and whites have been developed
through interracial membership of such civic committees as those for housing,
libraries, and city planning. Through the past several years, the members of
these committees have learned to understand and respect one another. It was from
the membership of these committees that the Negro representatives were chosen to
explain to other Negroes the proposed change of policy agreed to by the merchants.

(h) The vigorous leadership offered by white ministers helped in reassuring
the managers and in explaining their point of view to the Negroes. For a number
of years, forthright condemnation of enforced racial segregation had been made
from Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish pulpits, thus defining segregation as a
moral issue. It is difficult to see how the problem could have been worked out

without the effective direction given by the mediating committee of ministers.

(S) The pressure of the NAACP precipitated the meeting which led to the

desegregation agreement. Such pressure helped to crystallize the fear that had
been felt because of the sit—ins and other demonstrations over the South. Howeven
whites and Negroes interpreted the effect of the NAACP "ultimatum" differently.
Some of the white persons involved claimed that it almost wrecked negotiations
with the managers, while the Negro leaders were sure that desegregation would not
have been agreed to by the managers unless they had been under such pressure.

(6) Favorable press coverage helped to show this conflict as a human rights
struggle, and the press did not treat the situation in such a way as to arouse
racial antagonisms. The meeting of the religious and business leaders was given

no publicity so that those present would feel free to speak their minds.

 

GALVESTON

Galveston is located in southeastern (schools. Tb integrate by order of a

Texas on the eastern end of an island
thirty miles long and three miles wide
in the Gulf of Mexico. Many of its in-
habitants think of it as "different"
from the rest of Texas because it is
separated from the mainland. Its popu-
lation in.l960 is estimated by the
Chamber of Commerce to be 70,000, with
a racial composition 33% Negro, 15%
Latin-American, and 52% Anglo. One of
its largest "industries" is the Univer-
sity of Texas Medical School, which is
integrated. Public buses are desegre-
gated, and, while most Negroes live
separately from the Latin—Americans and
Anglos, there is no rigid residential
segregation. Some Negro families are
scattered among non4Negro families. The
public schools are segregated, although
the school board had planned to begin
integraticn at the first grade level in
September, 1957. The plans were halted
by a Texas law, which went into effect
on August 22, 1957, requiring a local

referendum befbre desegregation of

school board would result in a loss of
all state funds for education and fines
up to $1,000 for violators. Although the
Galveston school board attorney believed
the law unconstitutional, he suggested
that the city not try to contest it by

having state funds cut off.
Steps in Desegregation

On Friday, March 11, 1960, around
noon, a group of 25 Negro students from
Central High School began sit-in demon-
strations at wbolworth's. The students
had a holiday because of a teachers‘ con-
vention. Their resolve to claim equal
service had grown, according to the
youngster who organized the demonstration,
out of discussions in their American his-
tory class. They carried copies of the
United States Constitution and chanted,
"We'll take a seat and sit for a week."
when the manager of the store turned off
the lights and cooking burners and

announced the counter closed, the stu~

dents went to the counters at'Walgreen‘s,

-12..

 

which were promptly closed, and from
there to McCrory's, and then to Kress's.
The sit-ins continued on Saturday, and‘
most of the next week after school hours.
Police kept close watch over what was a
fairly tense and threatening situation.
The managers of the stores consulted in~
formally among themselves and agreed to
ignore the Negroes rather than close the
counters.

During one of the demonstrations in
his store, the Woolworth manager asked
the students who their spokesman was,
and a.l6-year—old junior came forward.

He assured the manager that the sit-ins
were entirely the idea of the students
and that no organization or adults were
behind them. The manager then requested
that the leader secure the help of re-
sponsible Negro adults who might talk
the situation over with the managers of
the stores. The Negro youth went to the
wealthiest and most influential Negro in
Galveston, a real estate dealer, who‘
suggested that a white lawyer, who had
chaired the school board committee re-
commending desegregation of public

schools, be asked to explain to the

managers what the Negroes wanted. The
high school boy then called on the law-
yer who, rather than talking with the
managers by himself, decided to set up a
mediating committee of influential
whites.

This white mediating committee proved
to be of crucial importance in working
out a solution. It was composed of
eleven persons: three lawyers; the owns
er of a radio and television station; a
clothing merchant; the wife of a cotton
broker; the owner of a furniture store;
and four ministers, representing the
Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faiths.
This committee met without publicity and

(1)

they would attempt to provide needed ‘

agreed on two basic principles:

leadership in order to keep irresponsi~
ble forces from moving into the situa-
tion; and (2) no publicity would be

given their attempt to mediate the con-

flict. The committee then asked the

managers of the stores involved to meet
with them.

After a lengthy conference, almost
all of the managers agreed to desegre-

gate their counters, provided certain

-13..

conditions could be met: (1) responsible

adult Negro leadership would have to be

organized to comunicate the new policy A

to the Negro community; (2) some assu-
rance would be given that no further
demonstrations would be held for at least
a month, giving those stores that could
not decide on desegregation immediately
time enough to consider it; (3) a promise
that Negro high school students would
wait two weeks before using the counters,
and that Negro adults would not overflow
the counters; (h) extra police help would
be available as the counters opened; (5)
the ministers on the mediating committee
would make a public statement supporting
desegregation. A detailed statement of
these conditions was later written and
put into the hands of each manager, medi-
ating comittee member, and Negro com-
mittee member. (A copy of this statement
is attached--Attachment B.)

The mediating committee then called
the high school youth and the real estate
dealer, requesting that a responsible
Negro comittee be set up. This was done

within four hours and was composed of

Negro businessmen, school teachers, labor:

leaders, doctors, dentists, and repre-

sentatives from the Negro students. The

‘ white mediating committee met with the

Negroes and conveyed the willingness of
the managers to desegregate if they
could.be assured the conditions would be

met. The Negroes readily agreed and

‘promised to try to their utmost to per-

suade the entire Negro community to com-
ply.

When the mediating committee relayed
the Negro promise of cooperation to the
managers, the final agreement to open
the counters on Tuesday, April 5, was
made. On the prior Sunday, Negro minis-
ters urged their congregations to move
slowdy in their use of the counters, and
on Monday, April h, the full statement
of agreement was announced over the pub-
lic address system to the Negro students
at Central High. Then, on April 5, the
Galveston jgibung carried the headline,
"City'Lunch Counters Integrated," giving
the city the first official news of the
decision. Contained in the newspaper
account was the following statement,

agreed upon by the mediating comittee

and the managers:

..]_)_L..

After conferences held between
Galveston store managers_and
Galveston leaders of all religious
faiths, and civic and business
leaders of the community, the mana-
gers of practically all the Galves-
ton stores having lunch counters
have decided that it is in the best
interest of the entire community to
open their lunch counters to all of
their patrons. This decision has
already been put into effect.

Religious leaders of Galveston
have joined in comending all per-
sons and interests involved for the
example they have set by solving
their mutual problem quietly and
moderately in the spirit of good
citizenship. The store proprietors
in turn have expressed their appre- !
ciation to those who provided the ;
mediation that led to this amicable ‘
solution.

The next day the following statement

appeared in the Galveston News, written E
by Mr. T. D. Armstrong, Negro real estate;
dealer and adult leader of the Negro
group:

The Negro citizens of Galveston
are thankful that this community
problem has been solved in a quiet
and moderate spirit of good citizen-
ship, functioning on the community
level as suggested by President
Eisenhower.

we are especially grateful to the
mediation which led to the solution
being provided by white civic and
religious leaders on their own ini-
tiative. we intend to see that our i
conduct in using this new privilege I
will prove us worthy of our respon-
sibility as good citizens in a city
of good will. 3

Results

Both the Negro adults and students
complied fully with the conditions set
down by the merchants. Few Negroes sat
at the counters during the opening days
of desegregation, and when they did, not
more than two of them sat together. The
Negro high school students scrupulously
avoided the counters during the first
two weeks, and they did not demonstrate
against stores that did not desegregate.
Some of the store managers received com-
plaints from white customers because of
the desegregation, and four accounts
were closed in one drug store and two in
another. However, in one case, the hus-
band phoned in the closing of the account
and the wife came to the store the next
day and reopened, apologizing for the
hasty decision of her husband. None of
the merchants felt that they had lost
trade during the first weeks of desegre-
gation. At one drug store, which has ho
lunch-counter seats, the manager com-
pared the total sales for April l-l9,
1959 with those for the same period in

1960. He found that his lunch-counter

-35..

 

sales were about the same, while the
sales in the rest of his store were
several hundred dollars higher in 1960.
Most of the people with whom the
writer talked at lunch counters, in taxi 5
cabs, on buses, and on the street,
accepted the desegregation readily.

Typical of remarks of approval were: "If

Negroes purchase in one part of the '
store, it is only fair that they should 3

"The Negroes just wanted to prove they ;

casually knew very much of how the
desegregation was brought about. They
remarked that they knew some influential
comittee was at work on the problem,

but they did not know who composed the

committee or how things were working out.

_One who disapproved said that the whites

must have given in to the Negroes, and
he did not know where it would all end.
The head of the chamber of comerce
received a long distance call or two
from.out-of-town persons who said they
would not vacation in Galveston again.
He also received a call from Governor
Collins of Florida who wanted to find
out how Galveston managed to desegregate
its facilities so quietly and success-
fully.

The ministers of all faiths and.races
have set up an informal group which a
steering comittee can call together at
any time. There is no question but what
there will be efforts by Negroes to de-
segregate other facilities. Negro leaders
feel now that there are channels through
which they may make appeals, rather than

having to resort to overt demonstrations.

Factors Contributing to Desegregation

(1) As was true of the other two cities, background factors were important to
the success of the desegregation. The school board was ready to begin a program
of school integration, with apparently no strong objection from the community. The
presence of the integrated University of Texas Medical School and of integrated
Latin-Americans provided a favorable atmosphere for the desegregation.

(2) Influential white leadership arose and took charge of the situation. These
were persons of good will who worked quietly and with genuine modesty to effect a
solution. Because of their positions in the community, they could speak with
assurance to both the merchants and the Negroes and thus were excellent mediators.
Furthermore, they gave vigorous and unequivocal support to the decision once it
was made. Special credit for the success of the mediating committee goes to the
lawyer who called the group together and to the minister who chaired the sessions.
(3) The store managers acted in a restrained manner. They did not order the
demonstrating Negroes out of the store or have them arrested, and they were willh
ing, furthermore, to learn their point of view. One manager took the lead in ask-
ing the Negro students to arrange to have adult Negroes represent them. Another
manager, born and reared in East Texas, stated at a crucial point in the meeting
of managers and.mediating committee that he would be willing to desegregate his
lunch counters if the others would. His decision helped to sway his fellow mana-
gers, for he had.lived in Galveston longer than any, and they felt he knew the
local situation well. His statement is credited by mediating comittee members as
turning the tide. Of course, the managers feared that continued demonstrations
would disrupt trade, and they wanted to avoid them. But they also spoke of want-
ing to be fair to their Negro customers. The managers had foresight enough to
allow time before the decision to desegregate went into effect to talk to their

employees. Some waitresses objected, but the managers were able to reason with

LUNCH-COUNTER DESEGREGANION IN CORPUS CHRISTI,

VGALVESTON, AND SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

them. No employee resigned when the new policy was announced.

(h) Negro leadership was highly effective in making sure the terms of the
agreement were carried out. Church services, lodge meetings, school sessions,
and informal gatherings were used to urge Negroes to be careful in taking advan-
tage of lunchucounter desegregation. All of the white persons involved in the
negotiations stated emphatically that the responsible, circumspect behavior of
the Negroes was a big factor in the success of desegregation.

(S) The clear support of the white ministers on the mediation committee
stressed the religious and moral aspect of the issue. The cooperation among the
three faiths was itself evidence of good wdll and a reflection of unity.

(6) Favorable reports on the results of the desegregation of lunch counters
in San Antonio reassured the merchants. By chance, the regional director of the
Anti~Defamation League of B'nai B'rith had just arrived in Galveston after spend-
ing several days in San Antonio. He was consulted by the comittee and was able
to point out that things were working well in that city and that none of the
stores with desegregated counters had encountered difficulty.

(7) Publicity was kept to a.minimnm. During the time of the mediation, few
persons in the community knew what was going on. Those present in the meetings
felt free to speak frankly without fear of being quoted. None of those in leads
ership positions attempted to gain anything personally from the situation. They
repeatedly stressed to all concerned that it was a community problem that
required a comunity solution.

(8) Prompt police action prevented any possible disorder. The police did not

allow any crowds to gather in the stores nor on the sidewalks.

 

GENERAL SUMMARY X

(1) It can be seen that each of the three cities followed a different
pattern in desegregating lunch counters, and it would seem likely that each
comunity of the South, depending on its size, racial composition, and tradi-
tions, may proceed somewhat differently. In other words, no single approach can

be used. However, of the three cases studied, Galveston, with 33% Negro, is
the most like other Southern cities.

(2) When the chips were down, influential white citizens in each city took a
firm stand for desegregation. In Galveston, this was done through direct parti-
cipation in the mediation by lawyers, ministers, and businessmen. In San Antoni;
only the religious leaders involved themselves directly, but they had the tacit
support of other influential persons.\ In Corpus Christi, the managers themselves
agreed to desegregation without a mediating group, but they felt sure that white

community leaders supported them. It is to be noted that public officials
stayed out of the negotiations. when approached by other white leaders, the
officials felt that mediation should be established on a less formal basis.

(3) Religious leaders were important to the success of desegregation in Gal-
veston and San Antonio. In both instances the managers asked for and received
public support from these leaders, and their support gave strong reassurance to
the managers.

(h) Those managers who took the lead in deciding for desegregation put the
decision on a moral basis, in line with American values. In each of the three
cities, one of the managers, at a crucial point in the negotiations, stated the
solution in terms of democratic ideals and expressed his willingness to desegre-
gate. Of course, the economic factor was also involved in the decisions, for

the managers reasoned that the alternative to desegregation would be worse for

"-19-

 

their business than desegregation. Examples of what had happened to businesses
in other cities helped to convince them that they should desegregate.

(5) Negroes in each of the cities revealed a willingness, even an eagerness,
to comply with the terms requested by the managers. In Galveston, the high
school students who started the sit-ins gladly waited two weeks to show good
faith, and in San Antonio and Galveston the Negroes readily agreed to a morato-
rium on acting against those lunch counters that did not feel that they could
desegregate at the time of the decision. And, for the most part, Negro patrons
of the lunch counters have been almost overly careful to avoid offending whites.
In all three cities the Negroes acted with a strong sense of responsibility in
making sure the desegregation was successful.

(6) In each case publicity was kept to a minimum. Everything said during
the meetings was held in confidence, no member of the press was present, and
reports to the press were cleared with the group. Even after the decision to I
desegregate was put into effect, the leaders were careful to limit the type of
publicity permitted. In both Galveston and San Antonio, reporters and photogran
phers from nationally circulated.magazines wanted stories and pictures of the
individuals involved in the mediation. But the leaders pleaded with the repre-
sentatives from the magazines not to give the decision this sort of publicity,
for they believed it could do a great deal of harm to focus the glare of publi-
city on something that was working well. They stressed to the reporters that
this was a cooperative, comunity decision, rather than the work of individuals.
The magazines complied. For example, in the April 18, 1960, edition of gigs,
the only publicity given to the Galveston desegregation was a picture of four
religious leaders, representing both races and the three faiths, with a "Welcome
to Galveston" sign in the background. Those depicted are referred to as "cata-

lysts in the quiet negotiations."

 

(7) It was freely admitted by the white leaders that without some direct
pressure by Negroes, desegregation would have been highly unlikely. The Negroes
were even surer of this. The type of pressure varied from requests over the
telephone, to mass rallies demanding action, to actual sit-in demonstrations.

No steps toward desegregation were taken until Negroes in each of the cities
asked for it. In Galveston, one of the managers said that if he and the other
managers had attempted desegregation on their own, without the crisis caused‘uy
the sit-ins, the white comunity would have been up in arms. But once the sit-
ins started, desegregation became a defensible solution.

(8) The success of the desegregation, in terms of the smoothness and calm»
ness with which it was generally accepted, surprised most of those involved. The
managers said that they had expected far more trouble, and far more resentment
by white patrons. However, as one manager expressed it, "Most of our fears were
creations of our own minds." Regardless of how whites felt about lunch-counter
desegregation before such desegregation took place, many of them expressed pride

in the accomplishment, once it was done.

Note: The following set of conditions for the desegregation
of lunch counters in Galveston, Texas, was worked out
by the managers of Woolworth's, Walgreen's, Kress,
McCrory's, Neisner's variety stores; and Star, Central,
Pharr, and Texas drug stores, March 30, 1960. This was
done with the help of a mediating committee composed of
eleven white civic and religious leaders. It was sub-
mitted by the mediating committee to representatives of
the Negroes protesting lunch-counter segregation, and
accepted by them and carried out in every detail, without
incident.

Date for Opening Lunch Counters:

On the supposition that the day selected for opening of lunch
counters on an integrated basis should be the day when the fewest
customers would be on hand, it would appear that next Tuesday,
April 5, 1960, would be the proper time.

Moratorium:

We understand that Romar and Seawall Drug Stores are not pre—
pared to open their lunch counters as yet. The agreement of the
Negro group will be secured that no Negro will attempt to patronize
those lunch counters, have a sitwdown, or boycott, or take other
action relating to those stores for a period of one month from
April 5, 1960. At the end of this time, if the Negroes desire that
those lunch counters be open counters, they will first discuss the
matter with the manager before taking any further action.

Publicity:

It apparently is the consensus that the less publicity the
better, since publicity will tend to attract extremists from both
races involved.

A formal news release should be given out. The store owners
and managers should be prepared in the event of inquiry by newsmen,
to state something as follows:

After conferences held between the store managers and
a committee of ministers of all faiths, and civic and
business leaders of the community, the store managers
of practically all of the stores decided that it was

in the best interest of the entire community to open

their lunch counters to all of their patrons without

regard to race.

If the colored persons involved are approached by newsmen,
their reply should be,"No comment." If asked if a similar agree-
ment will be sought from cafes and restaurants, the colored patn
ron should say simply, "No."

At all events there should be no publicity at all until the
opening of the counters is an accomplished fact, and then in the

°lowe§t possible key. There should be no suggestion at all that this
step was taken "to avoid violence," for such is an invitation to extrem-
ists of both races. ?

zNote= it was later decided that a formal release to the
newspapers, in much the same form as above, be given by the
chairman of the mediating committee, a Presbyterian minister,
h. Police: ;
Mr. Walter Rourke, Police Commissioner, will be requested to pro- 9
vide adequate policing during the early stages and as long as it appears
such is needed, with the request that he deal forcefully with any at
the first sign of violence on the part of any person of any race.

5. Undertakings of the Colored Students:
It must be agreed:

a. That no colored high school student will seek to patronize the
lunch counters involved for a period of two weeks, from April 5 to
April l9.

b. That at no time in the future will the colored students seek
entrance to any of the stores maintaining open lunch counters giving
integrated service to colored patrons in any organized group, nor con-
gregate in any such store in large numbers, in the spirit of merely
demonstrating that they have the privilege of being served at the
lunch counter.

c. That if the manager of a given store maintaining an open lunch
counter feels that colored students have unduly congregated in his
store in such large numbers as to impede his normal service to his
other customers, in violation of "b" above, the manager may request
that a portion of the school children leave the store and the students
will comply.

d. If any individual colored student, or group of colored students,
become boisterous, profane, intoxicated, or otherwise do not conduct
themselves in accordance with ordinary propriety, the manager of the
store may eject such students from his store, just as he would for any
other such customer.

e. That a colored student will not deliberately impose his pres-
ence on a white customer by sitting beside that customer, if other seat-
ing is available, nor attempt to engage that customer against his will
in conversation.

6. Undertakings of Adult Colored Leadership:

The adult colored leadership will exert every means within their
control, in church, lodge meetings and the like, to suggest to the en-
tire colored adult population that the opening of the lunch counters to
them is not a legal right that has been secured, but is a privilege
that the stores involved have conferred on their patrons as citizens of
the community. That in appreciation to the stores that have granted this
privilege, the colored community must recognize that every privilege en-
tails responsibility, and conduct themselves accordingl .

The adult colored community will be strongly requested to comply
with the general spirit of the limitations of 5b, c, and d above.

7. Further Liaison:

If any store manager feels that colored patrons, student or adult,
are creating needless problems, or are not conducting themselves prop-
erly, the membership of the white committee and the adult colored com-
mittee will continue to be available to the store managers to do what-
ever is possible to eliminate such objectionable practice.

San Antonio was the first city in consequent agreement by the managers of
the South to receive publicity for the four large downtown stores, after
desegregation of its lunch counters on several conferences with the Negroes,
March 16, 1960, and announcements of to desegregate. In San Antonio reli-

ggrpus Christi

Corpus Christi is a fast—growing ;
3
city on the Gulf of Mexico in south

Texas. In each tenayear period since
1920, the population has about doubled,
and informed persons estimate that
there are now about 175,000 residents,
made up of 7% Negro, 33% Latin—American,
and 60% Anglo. As a rapidly growing
city, it has a comparatively large num-
ber of young people, a factor cited by
some community leaders as a reason for
the ready acceptance of change in lunch
counter service. Public schools,
including Del Mar Junior College, were
integrated in 1955, and public recrea-
tional facilities, including golf and
swimming, were integrated a.year later.
The local NAACP took the lead in asking
for desegregation, but there was little

opposition and even some encouragement

by white civic leaders.

Steps in the Desegregation

The first lunch-couter desegregae

tion came in 19so_ inhthe H. E. ‘Butt

...._._....—_....-. ...._:_.,.

grocery stores, the largest of which

have lunch counters. when a Negro cus-
tomer was refused service, he asked to
speak to the store manager, who referred
him to the general manager, who suggesﬁﬂ
that he talk to the owner, Mr. Butt. The
Negro was told by the owner that he couli
be served, and an order was issued to the
store managers that all customers, in»
cluding Negroes, were to be served at the
counters in the same way. However, it
was not until 1952, according to one re-
port, that all storernanagers fully
complied.

The next step in lunch-counter den
segregation took place in the fall of
1958. Negro and white classmates from
an integrated school stopped in‘Wool-
worth's, sat at the lunch counter, and
requested service. when the Negro chil-
dren were refused, the whites walked out
with them. Later an adult Negro member
of the NAACP called on the manager of tire
store to inquire of his policy toward
serving Negroes. The manager replied

that he was willing to have Negroes

served seated at his counter, and since

 

that time Negroes have eaten there with-é

out restriction. However, apparently

i

not all Negroes knew about this privi- §.
I
§

lege, for weeks later some were still
standing to eat or were taking food out.
A.Negro dentist and former state NAACP
president told the writer that he asked
the Negroes who were standing why they
did not sit down. when they reported
that they did not know they were per-
mitted to, the dentist went to see the
manager who assured the Negroes that
they could sit if they wished.

In a.lengthy interview with the
manager, the writer was told that mana-
gers of‘Wbolworth stores were allowed
to run their stores as they see fit.
The manager said that he felt it silly
and unfair to allow Negroes to purchase
in other parts of the store and to
treat them unequally at the lunch coun-
ter. So without consulting the mana-

gers of other stores or anyone else, he‘

allowed Negro customers to be served.

He was sure that desegregation was come,
i

ing sooner or later and that his actiong
!
helped Corpus Christi avoid the diffi- 3

culties that have developed in other
Southern cities. While he had received
some "kicks" from other merchants and
from a few white customers, he told them
that he had to run his store according
to his best judgment. He noticed no
loss of business from whites or Latin-
Americans because of the integration.
The final phase in the desegregation

of lunch counters began March 15, 1960.
The manager of Kress's had been allowing
a Negro employee to eat at one end of
his lunch counter, but when this employxa
invited a Negro friend to eat with him,
the friend was refused service. The
‘Negroes reported this to an NAACP leader
who then telephoned the manager and ar-
ranged a time when they could discuss
the matter. In the meantime the Kress
manager called together the managers of
other stores in which there were sizable
lunch counters: 'Walgreen5s, Grant‘s,
and.Lichtcnstein‘s (a fashionable
department store with a tea room on the
fourth floor). After several confer-

ences among the managers and talks with

the NAACP leader, the managers agreed

on March 25 to desegregate their lunch i casual conversation with several lunch-
counters. They requested that no fo1ma1§ counter waitresses, white patrons, and

publicity be given to this decision but : taxi drivers, the writer found ready ac-

rather that Negroes be informed by way ceptance of desegregation. But it was

of the "grapevine." Several Negro min- i evident that not all prominent white

isters announced the decision in their citizens of the city knew about the de-

churches, and word was passed from Negro segregation. For example, when asked by

the writer, the pastor of one of the

Eactors Contributing to Desegregation

The following factors appear to be important in the success of lunch—counter
desegregation in Corpus Christi:

(1) The general attitude of the comunity has been permissive toward integrar
tion.. while there has been no overt drive toward desegregation by white community
leaders, only gentle prodding by the NAACr was required to induce the whites to
grant equal treatment. '

(2) White opposition, in the form of a White Citizen's Council, has been weak
and.led by lowmstatus persons. ‘When the Council objected during the Christmas
season of 1956 to having one of the wise men in a public representation of the
manger scene depicted as black, the objection was ridiculed by churchmen and civic
leaders, ‘when the Council demanded that the newly-built public swiming pool be

restricted to white use, the Park and Recreation Board, after hearing the NAACP

argue for its use by all, decided in favor of non-segregation.

(3) The fact that about one-third of the population is Latin-American made the
integration of counters more readily accepted. Apparently most Latin-Americans do
not have the prejudice against the Negro felt by many Anglos. And the Latin-

American is more likely to have contact with the Negro, in residential areas and

at lunch counters. In casual conversation with about ten or twelve Latin-Americans,

the writer found no hint of non-acceptance of desegregation but rather a pride in
its accomplishment. Also, since Latin-Americans have been integrated into most
aspects of community life in Corpus Christi, the integration of Negroes was easie-
for the whites to take.

(h) Negro leadership has been effective. While not aggressively and overtly
pushing for equality, it has, nevertheless, accomplished a great deal. The Negro
dentist mentioned earlier has, for example, by working quietly and persistently,
won the respect and confidence of white leaders. If desegregation is to be
brought about in other areas of community life--restaurants, hotels, movies, the
University of Corpus Christi (Southern Baptist)--it wﬁll require the same caliber

of Negro leadership and initiative.

 

SAN ANTONIO

San Antonio is a city of half a
million people, with a racial composi-
tion estimated by informed persons to be
9% Negro, h2% Latin-American, and h9%
Anglo. An important part of the economy
of the city is its military installa-
Fort Sam Houston, headquarters

tions:

for the Fourth Army; and the Air Force

bases at Brooks, Kelly, Lackland, Medina,
and Randolph fields. These installar I
tions are integrated, and San Antonio
lunch counters have for some time served
uniformed Negro soldiers and airmen,
especially when accompanied by white
military personnel. Public golf courses
were desegregated in June, 195b, and all
other public recreational facilities, inj
cluding swimming pools, in March, 1956.
Desegregation of public schools began.in
1955 and by 1960 all grades were desegnr?
gated. The six colleges in the area, i

both municipal and private, have Anglo,

Latin-American, and Negro students.L

Steps in the Desegregation

When the sit—in demonstrations

spread over the South during February,

1960, three independent developments be-
gan in San Antonio. (1) The executive
director of the Council of Churches (an

organization of 150 Protestant churches

of all prominent denominations except the

Southern Baptists) started talking with

religious and civic leaders to see if any

action could be taken to avoid overt

’ demonstrations in the city. Public offi-

cials, including the mayor, felt that it

would be best if they did not partici-

? pate directly, and they urged that repre-

sentatives of the various faiths take the
lead. The executive director of the
Council of Churches then brought together
white representatives of the Catholic,
Jewish, and Protestant churches, along
with the executive director of the Com-
munity welfare Council. They began to
meet toward the end of February to dis-

discussions on what course of action it 1
might take to bring about lunch—counter ;
desegregation. On March 7, 1960, a 17- :
year—old college freshman, president of ;
the San Antonio Youth Group of the NAACE§
began sending letters to downtown stores,
requesting equal service for Negroes. On
March 13, at a mass rally of 1,500
Negroes, the NAACP decided to mail a

formal "ultimatum" to downtown stores

requesting desegregation of lunch coun-

ters by Thursday, March 21.
This action brought the three sepa-

rate movements together. The religious

meeting came when the manager of a

national chain store urged that the
counters be desegregated. He declared
that to solve a moral problem was, at the
same time, to solve a business one, for,
he said, strife disrupts business and
creates ill will. He pointed out that
business had fallen off from hS to 60%
in some of the stores in his chain where
demonstrations had occurred. He further
pointed out that it was silly for whites

to complain of lunchwcounter desegrega-

tion as too personal when in his store

The store managers secured three come
mitments from the mediating committee in
regard to the proposed desegregation.
The first was that responsible Negro
leaders be informed about the new policy
and requested to move slowly in taking
advantage of the desegregation. The
second was that the Negroes agree to
take no action for 30 days against any
store that was not ready to desegregate
on March 20. The third was that the
