It is aggression when the United States, Great Britain‘

It is grossly insulting to the Soviet Union when a

Washington bureaucrat “loses” for six months an appli— _

cation of the U.S.S.R. for a billion dollar loan.

It is this kind of aggression, chieﬂy initiated by reac-
tionary American forces, that is fundamentally respon-
sible for the present tense situation in the world. The
meaning of it is that these reactionaries don't want agree-
ment with the U.S.S.R. To check and defeat such im-
perialist policies is our national duty to the world. We
must bridle the big American monopolists who want to
dominate the world, even at the cost of another great
war.

LABOR MUST DEFEAT THE WAR-MAKERS

Especially the trade unions should wake up to their
responsibilities. Immersed in their present great wage
struggles, the workers and leaders are paying far too
little attention to questions of foreign policy. Except,
of course, such stooges of American imperialism as Mat-
thew Woll and David Dubinsky, who are busily making
their nefarious inﬂuence felt in many directions abroad.
The honest progressive body of labor and its leadership
must realize that the great corporations which they are

11 '

now ﬁghting so hard on the domestic front, also have a

foreign policy, which is one of ruthless, imperialist ex-

— pansion. The present passivity of the unions in matters
" of foreign policy is a grave danger. Labor should protest

 

and demonstrate against Churchill’s war-mongering
speech and the whole get-tough-with-Russia policy of
the Truman Administration. Labor must awaken to the
danger now facing the peace of the world.

WHAT WAR AGAINST THE U.S.S.R. WOULD MEAN

In conclusion, let me say a few words of warning to
those reactionaries who are so eager for war against the
Soviet Union. They seem to think that that country
would be an easy victim, especially as we have the atomic
bomb. But other would—be conquerors of Russia thought
the same way and without exception they came to sad
fates as a result. Among them, the great Mongol con-
queror Ghenghis Khan who tried to subdue Russia, but
in the long run it was his forces that were demolished}
Charles XII of Sweden, another military genius, also
tried his hand at vanquishing Russia only to meet with
a ﬁrst class disaster; the Teutonic Knights also met their
rebuff when they launched Drang Nach Osten; Napo-
leon, too, sought to defeat Russia but he lost his empire
for his pains. And lastly, Adolph Hitler tried it, too, only

to have his “invincible” armies destroyed and his dream

   

of world conquest liquidated,
The United States escaped lightly from World War
II, with far fewer casualties than any other major power

on either side. But make no mistake about what would
happen if this country were criminal and foolish enough
A to tackle Russia. The United States would have to ﬁght
"such a war almost alone, and literally millions of our
{boys would surely die in a futile, reactionary cause.
And, atombomb or no atombomb, in the end the U.S.A.
would fare no better than the other would-be con-
if querors-. of the Russian people in the past. And the
, American people would ﬁnd that they had been plunged
adventurously into catastrophe.

..WAR AGAINST U.S.S.R. WOULD BE SUICIDAL

Perhaps, if our reactionaries disregard these short
‘ lessons of history, they will have to be taught another
kind of lesson. Let them look at the shattered condition
 of their beloved capitalist system throughout the world,
and give thought whether they want to go to war with
such —a weakened economic and political set-up behind
jtheni. World capitalism has emerged from World War
,II sick and shattered; it is economically and politically
l-undermined; it is torn with class struggles, imperialist
contradictions and colonial revolts. Another world war
- would be the endof this outworn system. So, gentlemen,
'iiMessieurs Truman, Churchill, Bevin and Byrnes, and
he big monopolists whose spokesmen you are, look care-
fully, very carefully, before you leap. .
A war of the capitalist nations against the U.S.S._R.
and the colonial peoples would be suicidal. A war un-
der present conditions would threaten all humanity,
including -the American nation, with inconceivable de-

\

13

 

 

 

struction from atomic bombs. American reactionaries

believe that this country now has sole control of the»

atomic bomb and, therefore, we can with few casualties
to ourselves, take advantage of this supposed fact to es-
tablish American control everywhere. To suppose that

' the United States alone possesses the atomic bomb is

 

gambling with the very life of our people. On the
contrary, there is every strong reason to believe that if

a war were to break out both sides would be equipped E’

with this fearsome weapon. Consequently, if our peo-

ple should go to war, we can anticipate losses in human _

life and property that would beggar prophecy.

Such a war is"not inevitable, as the reactionaries allege.

There is no reason, except for the greed of capitalist
monopolists and imperialists, why the American and So:
viet people who fought together and won together in
the great anti-Axis war, cannot live together in full
peace and harmony within the great family of nations.
They can, they must, they will. The very fate of civili-
zation demands it.

LET THE PEOPLE DEFEAT THE WAR-MAKERS

Let organized -labor, the veterans, the farmers, the»

women, the Negro people—everyone democratic and

progressive in the United States——give an overwhelming '

repudiation to Churchill, and Byrnes and their fellow"
war—mongers. This nation faces a grave danger. The

war-makers must be defeated. The Communist Party" 

pledges its everything to help arouse the American peo--
14 ‘

ﬁle and td cirganize thém against the war" danger ‘now 57 
being forced upon them by. American Aand“ British imé ‘

THE MEN ACE 0F A

NEW WOBLD WAR
By William Z. Foster

VVe are gathered together in historic Union Square
at a grave moment in world history. The imperialists
of the United States and Great Britain are trying to
stampede the peoples into another world war. This
constitutes a deadly national danger, one which must
be faced boldly. VVorld VVar II is still on ofﬁcially; our
soldiers are not yet back from the battleﬁelds. Yet the
reactionaries are already trying to launch VVorld VVar
III. It used to be that they would let a generation elapse-
between world wars, but now, like chain cigarette
smokers, they light one war from the other.

CHURCHILL CALLS FOR WAR AGAINST U.S.S.R.

Vvinston Churchil1’s speech yesterday in Fulton, M0,,
was a call for a general capitalist war against the Soviet
Union. Make no mistake about that being what he was
driving at. His proposed Anglo-American military
alliance directed against the U.S.S.R. and the colonial
peoples, is an up—to—date version of Hitler’s anti-Comin-
tern Axis. His speech was built around the Red bogey
and the whole business stank of fascism. It was the voice

3

 

of Churchill but the hand of Hitler. Such an anti-Soviet
tirade is not to be wondered at, coming from a man who
only a few years ago was full of praise for Mussolini and
who declared that if he were an Italian he would be a
fascist.

The war that Churchill wants would necessarily be
a war against democracy all over the world. It would be
aimed not only to overthrow the ﬁrst Socialist Republic,
but especially to smash the colonial liberation move-
ments in Britain's sphere in the Middle and Far East,
to undermine the new democracies in Europe and to
curb the workers in Great Britain, the United States “and
other countries. The people of this country and the
world won’t stand for such an imperialist war and they
will give Churchill a resounding “No!” that will ring

around the world.  ,1.

WHO IS BEHIND CHURCHILL’S WARMONGERING?

How could it be that the diehard old Tory Churchill,
driven out of office by his own people, could dare to
make such a war-mongering speech in the United States?‘
For this outrage our Government is heavily responsible.
Churchill’s speech was fully in line with the’American
Government’s get-tough-with—Russia policy, and it ﬁts
right in with similar speeches made a few days earlier
by Secretary of State Byrnes and Senator Vandenberg.
7President Truman himself bears direct responsibility,
lbecausc he deliberately staged Churchill’s speech and he
gave it his virtual endorsement beforehand. In taking
such action, together with many others of hisforeign

. 4 g V

 

 

policies, President Truman violated the peace mandate
given to President Roosevelt and himself by the Ameri-
can people in the last elections.

The British Labor Government is no less responsible
for the war-provoking speech of Churchill. It also is
following a get—tough-with-Russia policy in the Ameri-
can pattern. Foreign Secretary Bevin’s violent Soviet-
baiting prepared the way for Churchill. ‘This hard-

‘ boiled Tory never would have ventured to make the

ﬁrebrand speech he did had he not received direct en-
couragement from the course being followed by the
Attlee Government. The incident of Churchill presum-
ing to speak for the British people should be a warning
to the workers of Great Britain. Let them remember how
the Eberts and N oskes and Scheidemanns prepared the
way for Hitler, and be on guard against the Attlees and
Bevins (in the tradition of MacDonald) committing a
similar treason to the British people. i

AN AFFRONT TO COMMUNIST PATRIOTISM

Churchill in his speech poured out insults upon the
Communists of the world, challenging their spirit of
democracy and patriotism. What a contemptible ingrate!
Has he forgotten so soon that had it not been for the
Communist-led Soviet Union and its gallant Red Army,
his country and the rest of the world would now be
under the boot of fascist conquerors? And as for the

patriotism of the Communists, we may be sure of one '

thing, that everywhere they will do their utmost to save
their peoples from being plunged into the imperialist
T 5

bloodbath that Churchill and his fellow British and
American monopolists are preparing for them. The
Communists will not fail in this high patriotic duty.

Churchill's speech—with Byrnes’ and Vandenberg’s—
will sharpen political tensions all over the world; it will
deepen the already dangerous division among the Big
Three powers; it will ‘bring good cheer to the remnants
of fascism in Germany, Japan and elsewhere; it will be
meat and drink to Soviet—baiters and all reactionaries
throughout the world; it will extend more than a ray
of hope to the Goerings, Hesses and Ribbentrops in the
prisoners’ dock at Nuremburg; it will hearten reaction
in Turkey, /Iran and China and make more difficult a
friendly settlement of the differences between these
countries’ and the U.S.S.R.; it will bring grist to the anti-
Soviet crusade of the Vatican; it will give renewed vigor
to the predatory monopolists of the United States—all
of which reactionary, ends are precisely what Churchill
wants to accomplish.

The present is a moment when the workers, the war’

veterans, and our whole people, need to do some very

serious thinking. The basic questions they must come‘

to understand are the causes of the present dangerous
division among the Big Three powers and what na-
tion, or nations, are responsible for the split. Nor will
it be diﬂicult to ﬁnd the correct answer to these ques-
tions _if they will but look carefully into the policies of

the three great powers and not allow themselves to be V

blinded by the present widespread hate-Russia cam-
paign.

SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY SAFEGUARDS PEACE

_ First, let us see what is the basic foreign policy of the
Soviet Union? As a Socialist country, the U.S.S.R. is

_ inherently peaceful and non—imperialist. It wants to live

in ‘peace, surrounded by democratic neighbor states. Its
whole foreign policy is based upon these needs. Ho-w
deeply the U.S.S.R. wants peace and an opportunity to
develop its industries and raise the living standards of
its people is further emphasized by the terriﬁc losses it
sustained in the war, largely because of the slowness of
the United States and Great Britain in opening the
Second Front. The U.S.S.R. had some 20,000,000 of its
people killed; it lost $200 billion in property destroyed;

A one-third of its industry was wiped out, and scores of its

 
 

 

 

cities were devastated. Churchill and the myriad of news-
paper writers and politicians who » agree with him,
deliberately lie when they allege that the inherently
peaceful, war—wracked U.S.S.R. has embarked upon a
warlike policy of “imperialist expansion.” Hitler said
that if you are to tell a lie, tell a monstrous one, and the
more monstrous it is the more likely that it will be be-
lieved. Well, the Hitler big—lie of the present world situ-
ation is that the U.S.S.R. -is on an “imperialist offensive.”

ENGLAND’S IMPERIALIST FOREIGN POLICY

Now, let us examine brieﬂy what is the center of
Great Britain's foreign policy. This, too, is not difficult
to understand. The fact is that the British Empire is now
in the deepest crisis ofyits career. It is torn with economic

7

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
     
   
   
     
   
    
       
   
  

   

crisis and is tottering all over the Middle and Far East ‘ E
from the growing revolts of the peoples of India, Burma, V
Egypt, Palestine, etc. What Churchill wants is that the
  American people save this decaying British Empire. He
 1 would have the United‘ States send millions of its boys
A to die on European and Asiatic battleﬁelds, and ‘pour/'
A  V» out its billions in cash, so that British parasite capitalists

  may continue to live on the backs of their colonial slaves.
Churchill’ thinks that the major blows must be directed
against the U.S.S.R. because it is the great Socialist bul-
wark of world democracy and the friend of all oppressed
peoples. But the Tory Churchill is in for a big lesson.’ \
Before he is done—-as spokesmen like Senators Kilgore,
Pepper and Taylor have signa1lized—he will learn that

the American people are not going to send their sons

to die to save his crumbling Empire.

 

AMERICAN MONOPOLY’S AIM FOR WORLD
DOMINATION

Finally, let us look-at the world policy of the other
one of the Big Three powers: namely, the United States.
A ‘  . Just what is the American Government’s foreign policy
A based on? Our loud-mouthed reactionaries, echoed by
Browder, tell us that it is animated by the purest ideal-
. ism, that we are a nation of good-hearted innocents

4 \ going about the world trying to adjust amicably other
A people’s problems. But this idyllic picture is just so
much drivel for political infants. The cold factis that A
A ‘the great nionopolists of the United States, who are now

qdictating our foreign‘ policy, are aiming at establishing

  

    

 

 

American imperialist domination over the rest of the
world, with the British Empire serving as a sort of junior
partner. It is this imperialist drive by the United States,
abetted by the British, that is the root cause of the pres-
ent split among the Big Three powers.

The United States, coming out of the war with its
cities undamaged, with its industries enormously ex-
panded, with tremendous armed forces, with fabulous
gold supplies, with the atom bomb under its control—is
far and away the richest and most powerful capitalist
country in the world. The great monopolists want to
cash in on this superior American strength in the midst
of a starving war—devastated world. They believe that

‘now is the time to begin to realize the “American Cen-

tury” of Henry Luce. Hence, all over the world, with
the aid of President Truman, they are carrying on
policies of aggression and expansion that are threatening
the peace of the nations. Let me give you a few examples
of their aggressive policies: '

AMERICA’S REACTIONARY, AGGRESSIVE,
EXPANSIONIST POLICIES

It is imperialist aggression and a menace to interna-
tional peace when the United States monopolizes the
atom bomb and brandishes it before the world. L

It is similar aggression when President Truman pro-

 poses that we haveia navy and airforce bigger than those

of all the rest of the world put together, and also a huge
army based on universal military training. ‘
