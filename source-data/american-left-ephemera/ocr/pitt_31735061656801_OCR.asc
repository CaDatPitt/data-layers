THE MELISH CASE

had founded in New York City. For the subject of what proved to be
his ﬁnal sermon to his people, he chose “The Melish Case,” and spoke
on its signiﬁcance for American civil liberties. Forced to his bed a few
days later, he passed into a ﬁnal coma. Opening his eyes, he asked his
daughter, “What has happened to my friends, the Melishes?”

Such are among the many indications that this is something more
than a conventional parish controversy. It is a matter that involves
grave issues of freedom and democracy and peace. By observers within
and without the country, what has happened at Holy Trinity is being
interpreted as a symptom of certain basic changes taking place in
American life and psychology in a period when the democratic tradi-
tion is being challenged by economic pressures resisting social change.

For the religious it brings up sharply the question of the Church’s
capacity to preach the Gospel of its Lord. “Why doesn’t the Church
speak out?”

Here is the answer. The prophetic ministry is dangerous. Only the
most intelligent, imaginative, convinced and selfless among the clergy
will run the risks of a creative social ministry. When they do, they
often ﬁnd their worst enemies, as ]esus did, not in the secular ﬁeld
but Within the hierarchy and the lay leadership of their own churches.

The situation at Holy Trinity that has provoked these worldwide
repercussions is analyzed in these pages. The story is complex but
raises many questions that a Christian Church, wishing to survive and
to win converts in the contemporary, changing, urban and industrial
world of the second half of the Twentieth Century, will do well to
ponder.

 

 

CHAPTER ONE

A PROPHETIC MINISTRY

FORTY-FNE YEARS AGO the Church of the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn,
New York, was on the lookout for a new rector. This distinguished
parish, made famous by the music of Dudley Buck, had enjoyed the
civic ministry of Charles Henry Hall who while rector had served
on the Civil Service Commission, and the intellectual preaching of
Samuel McConnell whose sermons and lectures on liberal religion had
taken him from coast to coast. On the Vestry was a remarkable lay-
man, Mr. George Foster Peabody, who had made a fortune in invest-
ment banking and now, inspired by the theories of Henry George and
the social teachings of Francis Greenwood Peabody and Walter
Bauschenbusch, was seeking to further a vital Christianity. Learning
of a young clergyman in Cincinnati who might be well suited to meet
Holy Trinity’s requirements, he journeyed west to interview him, and
then persuaded the Brooklyn Vestry to extend a call. In 1904 the Rev.
]ohn Howard Melish came to Holy Trinity and began a ministry that
has made him known throughout the Church as a leading exponent
of the social application of the Christian Gospel.

In Cincinnati this red-headed football player—“Deacon Melish”—
after preparing for the ministry, had gone on the staff of downtown
Christ Church in association with Frank Nelson, where he had built
up a remarkable work among underprivileged men and boys who
needed recreational and social opportunities. Friendship with these
working boys opened his eyes to certain ugly facts. He found that
many were losing their wages on Saturday nights in gambling houses.
When he protested, the police laughed at his innocence and disclosed
the tie-in between the organized gambling racket and the corrupt Cox
machine that ruled the city. Similar abuses were coming to light in
other municipalities and were being described in a brilliant series of
magazine articles, “The Shame of the Cities,” by Lincoln Steffens.
Howard Melish invited this roving reporter to visit Cincinnati. After
the first few days he expressed disappointment. He had unearthed no
graft. A week" later he declared, “This is the most corrupt city in Amer-
ica because the graft is hidden and eﬂicient.”

THE MELISH CASE
 

The young minister described these ﬁndings in his Sunday evening
sermons. More people attended than came to hear the rector of the
parish in the morning. There was sharp disagreement. The Christ
Church vestrymen, prominent ﬁgures in the community, were
distressed at revelations that involved their friends and business as-
sociates, and to some degree compromised themselves. The Cincinnati
Times-Star pilloried the preacher as a “muck raker” and printed car-
toons showing him hurling mud at the fair banner of Cincinnati. The
Post came to his defense. Such a wave of civic indignation was aroused
that a movement began to coalesce to ﬁght the Cox machine. _It proved
the precursor of the City Charter Movement that made Cincinnati for
years a model among American municipalities with its city manager
form of government and its use of proportional representation for its
City Council. Years later, the University of Cincinnati, which in the
Cox-dominated days had virtually disowned its star football player
and graduate, was happy to honor him with the degree of Doctor
of Laws.

Howard Melish agreed to come to Holy Trinity on two conditions.

V The pew rental system must be abandoned in favor of a free church

open to all worshippers, and the rector must have the right to de-
termine policy and not simply be the executant of policy already
determined. To these conditions the vestry consented.

Although The Brooklyn Eagle greeted the newcomer as “the young
Dr. Parkhurst from the middle west,” he avoided any futile attempt to
repeat his Cincinnati civic reforms and devoted his energies to the
creation of a program for his new parish along institutional lines. Once
again the work with men and boys proved most successful. Trinity
Club came to have more than a thousand members and its teams
competed successfully with the best amateur athletic clubs in the city
in baseball, track, boxing and handball.

Next to his interest in men and boys, Dr. Melish gave his best talents
to his preaching. These were the days when biblical studies and scien-
tiﬁc criticism were something new. He made the liberal approach to
religion the theme of his sermons. Intellectual inquiry continued to be
a part of the parish’s life and outlook, as it had been in Dr. McConnell’s
day. Drawn to Holy Trinity in consequence were men and women
from all parts of Brooklyn who wanted the Christian religion to appeal
to their minds and consciences as well as to their emotions. Supple-
menting the pulpit for handling the more controversial questions, a
forum was developed in the parish house where spokesmen for many
causes joined in brisk debate. Invited to preach on Sunday would be

10

 

A PVROPHETIC MINISTRY

such socially-minded men as Bishop Spalding of Utah and Bishop
Williams of Michigan. When Dr. Algernon Crapsey of Rochester was
accused of heresy because of his unorthodox views on the Virgin Birth,
it was Holy Trinity that gave him a hearing and a member of the
parish, Mr. Edward M. Shepard, who later conducted his legal de-
fense. Hospitality to new ideas became a parish characteristic. The
liberal tradition was strong, the text engraved upon the pulpit—“The
Truth Shall Make You Free”—was taken literally, and in the back-
ground was the generous _Mr. Peabody whose bulwarking of the
budget did much to keep the parish serene. From him and others like
him was to come the bulk of the endowments that since have helped
maintain this downtown church.

Perhaps the most explosive religious book ever to appear in America
was written in the parish house, unbeknown to the rector, by the
superintendent of its Trinity Club work, Bouck VVhite. “The Call of
the Carpenter” was a pioneer attempt to interpret ]esus as a social
revolutionary and to use economics as a key to the understanding
of his times, a method more recently employed by Conrad Noel in
England whose “Life of Jesus” was inspired by Bouck White’s book.

Though Dr. Melish was never a Socialist in theory or partisanship,
he numbered many socialists and paciﬁsts among his friends. He wrote
an eloquent biography of the great socialist bishop of Utah, Frank
Spalding, and a: beautiful tribute to his successor, the paciﬁst bishop of
Utah, Paul Jones. Deeply attracted by the intellectual and ethical
idealism of both movements, he nevertheless rejected their dogmatic
formulation, preferring simply to call himself a “Social Christian.”

Believing in the rights of Labor, he sat for many years on the Cen-
tral Labor Union of Brooklyn as a representative of the diocese of
Long Island. In the Steel Strike, when the eight-hour day and the
closed shop were ﬁghting issues, he joined with Bishop McConnell,
Rabbi Stephen S. Wise and Dr. John Haynes Holmes in public, sup-
port of the workers against the Steel Trust. As World War I drew near,
he spoke against the economic and imperialistic rivalries that were
making the conﬂict inevitable. A wave of criticism descended upon his
head. He has often told his friends that he might have been ousted
from his parish in that delirium of pre-war patriotism, had not an ac-
cident conﬁned him to a hospital bed for many months and welded
around him once again the divided sympathies of his parishioners.
Due to the carelessness of a subcontractor, the stairway of an elevated
railway platform under repair was left unguarded. Coming home from
a meeting late at night and running to catch an approaching train,

11

THE MELISH CASE

he plunged through a missing step to fall eighteen feet to the pave-
ment below. His hip and wrist were badly shattered. Ever since he
has been lame and deprived of such favorite recreations as tennis, golf
and horseback riding. When he was able to return to the parish, the
war was on. The congregation eagerly organized to meet the recrea-
tional and social needs of the service men who were passing through
the port of New York.

In the ensuing years at least four major creative contributions have
been made by Holy Trinity. Out of the unity and comradeship of the
war were born the Community Lenten Noonday Services which ever
since have invited not only Episcopalians as preachers but the leading
representatives of other denominations, and, since World War II, at
least one liberal rabbi in each season. With the aid of such
prominent medical men as Dr. Luther Warren, Dr. Richard West-
brook and Dr. Robert L. Dickinson, Holy Trinity started the Associate
Clinic of Religion and Medicine, bringing together doctor, psychia-
trist and spiritual adviser to minister as a team to troubled mind and
body. Two brownstone houses adjoining the rectory were purchased
to provide a residence for young men and women coming from the
colleges to take their ﬁrst jobs in New York City, where they might
enjoy congenial and wholesome living quarters on beginners’ incomes.
In the parish house a Committee on Housing was established, with
an oﬁce and a volunteer secretary, from which stemmed the pioneer-
ing studies for the public low-cost housing projects that now grace
many sections of Brooklyn. All this time the gymnasium and the parish
house were constantly in use for recreation among men and boys
without distinction of race, cultural background or religion. These
activities were criticized because they brought only a scant handful
of recruits .. into the parish from their many members, but they have
done something that has been more important. They have given the
Church a respect and a moral standing in the whole community of
Brooklyn.‘

In the debate on American participation in the League of Nations,
Dr. Melish took a part, preaching and writing in its behalf, visiting
many cities. Together with his wife, he marched in peace parades.
At Holy Trinity was formed what he has always thought to be the
first Parish Peace Committee in the county. For years it continued
to distribute educational literature to the members of the congrega-
tion and to all the ministers of Brooklyn churches in an attempt to
stimulate interest in effective international cooperation.

The inﬂux of thousands of new residents from other cultures into

12

 

 

A PROPHETIC MINISTRY

Brooklyn created a vast problem of assimilation. This became the par-
ticular ﬁeld of interest for Mrs. Melish who for many years served on
the board of the International Institute of the Y.W.C.A. which main-
tained on Brooklyn Heights a hostel to which working girls of different
cultural backgrounds might come to live.

In a New York City controlled by Tammany Hall, the old concern
for clean government was not forgotten. With other leading citizens
Dr. Melish served for many years on the City Affairs Committee. When
conditions during the term of Mayor ]ames  Walker became intoler-
able, he played a modest part in the formation of the fusion movement
under ]udge Samuel Seabury that elected F iorello H. LaGuardia to
City Hall. When William O’Dwyer was inaugurated Mayor, it was Dr.
Melish who gave the invocation at the induction ceremonies.

That this outreaching social ministry was no arbitrary thing but
had the interest and the stamp of approval of the larger Church is
clearly indicated by the election of Dr. Melish as a clerical deputy
from Long Island to the triennial General Convention of the Episcopal
Church on four separate occasions: in 1913, 1916, 1933., and 1934; and
by his appointment as secretary of the Joint Commission on Social
Service of General Convention, the predecessor of the present Social
Service Department of the National Council.

Twice in his ministry at Holy Trinity deputations came to see him
from vacant dioceses that were aboutto elect bishops. In each case,
after thoughtful discussion with his intimate friends as well as his
family, he declined the nomination. He loved the work of a parochial
minister and cherished above all else the freedom of the pulpit which
he enjoyed at Holy Trinity. Although he respected the work of a
bishop and had seen the moral power and prestige of the oﬂioe when
held by a man of courage and intellectual conviction, he knew the
heavy responsibility placed upon a bishop to ﬁnance his diocese, the
constant‘ need to solicit funds from those able to give generously, and
the curtailment inevitably involved for a preacher concerned with
contemporary issues. He never regretted these decisions.

The life of the parish moved along steadily. Occasionally there were
difficult moments as when an assistant minister, the Rev. Bradford
Young, joined the Socialist Party, ran for the Board of Aldermen on
that ticket, and campaigned in traditional soapbox style under the
American flag on the streetcorners of Brooklyn Heights. VVhen a
serious strike broke out in the clothing industry in Paterson, New
]ersey, Mr. Young took part in the picket lines and spent a night in
jail. Later, when thugs and goons were hired to beat up women work-

THE MELISH CASE

ers, he involved himself in a strike at the Brooklyn Edison Company
as a mark of public protest. The president of the company withdrew
from the parish and canceled a sizable annual contribution. This the
two ministers made up by taking cuts in their own salaries. By calm-
ness and patience the rector weathered all such diflicult moments. Mr.
Young worked at Holy Trinity for thirteen years, winning the loyalty
of the congregation and more than justifying the parish policy of com-
plete freedom for the conscientious minister to express his convictions
in word and action.

The conception of a church that Dr. Melish has inspired the con- J

gregation at Holy Trinity to accept, is that of a worshipping com-
munity radiating its moral and spiritual inﬂuence out into the larger
world. The Christian Ministry is possessed of a dual function. It is
both priestly and prophetic. In worship, sacramental life and preach-
ing, a church expresses its allegiance to the Christian Gospel as the
New Testament presents it. It is then incumbent upon clergy and laity
alike to go forth and apply this Gospel to concrete situations in their
neighborhood, the larger community, the nation and the world. This
they must do by the light of their individual insight, imagination and
conscience. Around the altar, the lectern and the pulpit will be found
that unity which flows from common loyalty to the Person and teach-
ing of Christ. In the concrete application there will inevitably be much
variation and difference of opinion that will require mutual tolerance.
Complete agreement is never to be expected. Indeed, it is not even
an end to be desired. The objective of a parish is to stimulate a Living
and Applied Christianity reaching out into the life of a world crying

out for the Gospel of Redemption and Reconciliation. This Gospel in '

all its living vitality is the religious heritage that Dr. Melish and his
associates are fanning into ﬂame among the people of Holy Trinity.

CHAPTER TWO

ELIJAH’S MAN TLE

IN 'I'HE SUMMER of 1939, the Rev. Mr. Young received a call to become

rector of Grace Church, Manchester, New Hampshire. After thirteen _

years at Holy Trinity, it seemed wise that he should accept it. His leav-
ing confronted rector and vestry with a serious problem. Dr. Melish
had been ill that spring and was no longer a young man. No one
wished him to retire not at sixty-ﬁve did he wish to do so. Yet the de-
mands of the parish in the changing Heights surroundings were such
that he required more competent assistance than that of an average
curate fresh from the seminary or an older minister willing to accept
a subordinate position.

After exhaustive discussion, on the initiative of the Vestry an emis-
sary was sent to Christ Church, Cincinnati, to interview the Rev. Wil-
liam Howard Melish, the younger son of the rector. Thanks to a con-
siderable ﬁnancial settlement for damages involved in his accident,
Dr. Melish had been able to give his second boy the best education
for the ministry available. He was a Harvard graduate and had spent
a year at Union Theological Seminary and ‘a summer at the Cincinnati
Summer School in Social Service where he had done ﬁeld work as a
probation ofﬁcer in the Juvenile Court. Two years followed‘ at Cam-
bridge University in England where he studied theology as an under-
graduate at Jesus College, became president of its debating society
and rowed at Henley in the Royal Regatta. Returning to the United
States with a Master’s degree, he took a fourth year at the Episcopal
Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, doing work at
nearby Harvard in philosophy under Professor Whitehead and in gov-
ernment under Professor Hocking. Then, like his father forty years
before, he joined the staff of Christ Church, Cincinnati.

In four years’ time he moved from third assistant to the aging Dr.
Frank Nelson to become his sole associate, developed competency
as a preacher, mastered the various aspects of the institutional church,
and did pioneering work in the creation of community councils in
Cincinnati. Outside the parish he became the Cincinnati chairman of
the Emergency Peace Campaign, planning its program with Alfred

15

 

THE MELISH CASE

Moore of the Methodist Publishing House and Rabbi Abraham Cron-
bach of Hebrew Union College. Their most ambitious undertaking
was a citywide rally involving all the Cincinnati protestant churches,
at which Miss Maude Royden of England was to be the speaker. That
day the Ohio River over-ran its banks in the worst ﬂood on record,
the meeting had to be canceled, the city was placed under martial
law, and for the next fortnight Christ Church parish house became
the home of a hundred refugees from the river front.

Twice in Cincinnati Mr. Melish came under attack for his social
views. When he advocated an embargo on scrap iron, oil and machine
tools being sent to Japan for the war in China, parishionefs protested,
whose income came from the Cincinnati milling machine companies.
When he joined with other ministers in sponsoring the first public
meeting to be held in Norword, an independent area within Greater
Cincinnati where were located the assembling plants of major auto-
mobile factories, the local press raised an outcry. The other clerical
members ran to cover, all meeting halls were denied, and the gathering
ﬁnally took place in a private home across the Norwood-Cincinnati
line. With Mr. Melish in this ﬁrst experience of strife in a company-
dominated community was a young Wellesley College graduate, Mary
Jane Dietz, who later became his wife.

The Washington Cathedral was in process of reorganizing its staff.
There was a proposal to employ four canons, sharing the services and
preaching, each assigned to a special ﬁeld and pooling experiences in
regular teaching assignments at the College of Preachers attached to
the Cathedral. Mr. Melish was invited to become Canon Almoner,
the antiquarian title for the minister in charge of case—work and as-
signed to relate the Cathedral to Washington social agencies. The post
would mean wide contacts in the national capital, opportunity to teach
and preach, the stimulus of meeting ministers from all parts of the
country, and security of tenure. ,

To induce Mr. Melish to come to Holy Trinity instead of accepting
the attractive Washington canonry, the Vestry offered him similar
security of tenure by entering a contract that he should come to work
with his father as assistant minister but with the right of succession
upon his father’s retirement or death. This contract was entered into
with the explicit knowledge and approval of the bishop of the diocese,
the Rt. Rev. Ernest M. Stires, D.D., and followed a similar procedure
adopted some years before by Trinity Church, New York, in the case
of Dr. Manning who was called to be the assistant to Dr. Dix with
the right of succession.

16

 

 

 

ELI]AH,S MANTLE

Things went happily. The two men shared the services and preach-
ing, alternating in the pulpit morning and evening. Mr. Melish under-
took to handle the Church School and the oﬂice routines, to share in
the calling and to do the community activities that his father had
done in earlier years. Dr. Melish concentrated on a ministry to the
older parishioners, the sick and the shut-in, allowing his son to follow
up the new people attracted to the parish.

In addition to parochial duties Mr. Melish began to play a con-
siderable role in the diocese of Long Island. He was elected to the
Diocesan Council, served as chairman of the Department of Christian
Social Relations, and disbursed many thousands of dollars as the
treasurer of the diocesan Army and Navy Commission. He took an
interest in the displaced Nisei and helped establish on Brooklyn
Heights a Japanese Hostel. He stimulated the merger of the parishes
of the Good Shepherd and St. Philip’s that resulted in the creation of
a new parish and community center in the rapidly-expanding Negro
section of Brooklyn. At Holy Trinity he interested the Vestry in placing
the parish buildings at the disposal of the Brooklyn Protestant Guild
of the Deaf and for nearly ﬁve years conducted services for deaf-
mutes at Holy Trinity and St’. Ann’s Church for the Deaf in Manhattan.
Serving on the board of the Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation,
he headed first its sub-commission on Economic and Social Justice
and then the sub-commission on International Justice and Good Will,
attending as its representative the Cleveland Conference on a Just and
Durable Peace.rA hard-working man, accustomed to long hours, little
time for recreation, and a wide range of simultaneous interests, he
began the same kind of many-sided ministry in which his father had
so long served the Brooklyn community.

Now that the war was on, Mr. Melish saw that the future would be
very largely shaped by the post-war relations between the United
States and the Soviet Union. With these two countries allied in a com-
mon struggle, there was provided an opportunity such as might not
come again in which a contribution towards greater understanding
and cooperation between them might be made. Here was a crucial
area in which the Christian Church as a creative and redemptive
society ought to pioneer.

This conviction led Mr. Melish to spend his spare evenings helping
to organize Russian War Relief chapters in Brooklynand Manhattan.
In his leisure hours he read the best materials available on the Soviet
Union and learned to read Russian. The first talks on American-Soviet
relations that he gave were so well received that other invitations came

THE MELISH CASE

and the fees he donated to the relief program. The United States War
Department asked him to speak at a number of Army posts in the New
York area where he addressed thousands of service men. Without in-
terfering with his parish work or sermon preparation, he averaged two
such talks a week over a period of four years, and various articles
from his pen appeared in national publications.

The basic theme of this speaking and writing was the same: the
United States and Russia, in spite of their differences of economic
and political system, can and must learn to live peacefully together.
Neither can eliminate the other by force or coercion. They must build
the future by both of them contributing to some form \of effective
United Nations’ Organization. The way to peace between them is to
explore the things that the two peoples hold in common as well as their
differences, and to encourage every form of intellectual and cultural
exchange possible. To commend such a program to a wider public, be
joined with other prominent New Yorkers in founding an organization
for this purpose, incorporated under the Laws of the State of New
York, the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship.

Except for one member of the Vestry who came to see him privately
and voiced an emphatic personal protest, Mr. Melish experienced no
serious objection to this work, nor did any criticism come to the ears
of the rector. This was an undertaking in keeping with the parish
tradition of practical work for peace. These were “outside activities.”
Except for two evening Russian War Relief services and one evening
mass meeting in support of the San Francisco Conference at which the
United Nations was founded, there was no intrusion of this special
interest into the life of the parish. Like all of America, the parishioners
shared differences of opinion concerning the proper attitude to take
towards Russia but during the war up to the death of President Roose-
velt-there was the same general acceptance of this work for peace that
had marked other creative and exploratory Christian efforts in the
previous decades of Dr. Melish’s ministry.

In the spring of 1946, Mr. Corliss Lamont resigned from the chair-
manship of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship which
he had headed since its foundation. The board asked Mr. Melish if he
would consent to his election. After talking the matter over with his
father, he agreed and in June succeeded Mr. Lamont. It proved to
be an unpropitious time to assume such a post. The Truman Doctrine
was shortly in process of promulgation. The “cold war” was about to
begin in earnest. As the international situation degenerated, the Holy
Trinity Vestry became a local barometer. Storm signals began to reg-

18

 

 

 

ELI]AH’S MANTLE
 

ister. The individual vestrymen did not realize that they were repeat-
ing what had happened in the parish once before in 1917.

This time, as the issue developed, it inevitably involved both minis-
ters. Spiritually and ethically their views had the same motivation. The
son was a chip off the old block. At Holy Trinity, to borrow the words
of a familiar hymn, “E1ijah’s mantle was o’er Elisha cast.” When the
vestrymen, in their growing antipathy to the public position taken by
the assistant minister, found that the rector was in accord with him,
they turned the ﬁre of their antagonism on him as well. Instinctively
they were acknowledging the prophetic identity of the two. They were
striking not so much at either individual man as at a type of Applied
Christianity that the'“cold war” was making an embarrassment.

CHAPTEB THREE

THE FIGHT FOR PEACE

on: Dr. and Mr. Melish recognized that this work for peace they
B had undertaken would have its risks. The daily increase in war-
talk and the growing assumption that war was inevitable deeply
troubled them. They shared the conviction that war between the
United States and the Soviet Union could be avoided. For thirty years
the two nations had lived peacefully in the same world. In a great war
against a common foe they had collaborated successfully. However
difficult the problems existing between them, a way to resolve them
without recourse‘ to war must be found. Certainly there were grave
differences but there were also many things they held in common.
The immediate task was to preserve what one could of the good will
born of the war alliance, to check the development of some spiral of
distrust and rearmament, and to encourage all points where construc-
tive cooperative effort might prove possible. This was a task for the
Christian conscience. It had to speak out now, or it might forever have
to hold its peace.

The two ministers were not communists but they were concerned
about the meaning of communism and the reasons for its increasing
spread. Remembering the long struggle between religious institutions
and Darwinism, they asked if there might not be some parallel in this
matter of Marxism. Here was a body of thought containing at least
sufficient truth that in the course of a hundred years it was winning
a wider and wider acceptance until now it was motivating whole
governments under which considerable V sections of the Christian
Church must live. It was not possible to dismiss these new ideas, nor
could their implications be evaded. There was the double task con-
fronting the Christian Church of ﬁnding a strategy to maintain worthy
religious institutions and clarifying intellectually the true relationship
between the two ideological systems of thought.

Both men had noted a parallel between the current impact of com-
munism on western Christendom and the 16th Century impact of
Protestantism upon a Roman Catholicism intertwined with the chang-
ing feudal system—a comparison pointed out to them by their friend,

20

 

 

THE FIGHT FOR PEACE

the Arctic explorer, Dr. Vilhjalmar Steffanson. Both periods involved
the emergence of new ideological systems closely related to certain
fundamental economic needs. The bitter religious wars that resulted
in the 16th Century did not resolve the ideological struggle but only
laid Europe waste. Men ﬁnally had to learn to live together on the basis
of political compromise and the tolerance of religious difference. Some-
thing similar would probably prove true of the current world situa-
tion. The ideological conﬂict between communism and Christianity
was not to be lightly dismissed but neither could it be treated as simply
a clash of abstract thought. It was closely connected with economic
facts and political structures that were themselves changing. It could
not be disengaged from the struggle everywhere for a better organized
and more productive society capable of meeting human needs and able
to remain at peace within itself. Christianity with its doctrine of man,
and communism with its assertion of a humanist philosophy, both had
a considerable stake in an ordered world. With the new atomic and
bacteriological weapons, war was now a menace to both societies. An

, alternative must be found or both would tend to harden into militarized

units at each other’s throat. ,

As chairman of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship,
Mr. Melish gave public expression to this point of view. He went to
Washington to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
against the Greek-Turkish Loan and the Truman Doctrine. Speaking
almost immediately after Mr. LaGuardia had pleaded for U.N.R.R.A.,
he warned against American by-passing of the United Nations and this
placing of reliance primarily upon arms and coercion. He stressed
the alternative of a long range program of relief, reconstruction, stimu-
lation of East-West trade and the expansion of cultural exchange.

In ]une of 1947 his position as a responsible public spokesman was
recognized when the Town Hall of the Air invited him to fly to Des
Moines, Iowa, to participate in a broadcast forum sponsored by Drake
University before a theatre audience of nearly ﬁve thousand people
and a radio audience of four to ﬁve million, on the subject, “Are
Christianity and Communism Incompatible?”

Two months later he received an invitation from the Yugoslav Am-
bassador in Washington to join a group of protestant clergymen going
to the Federated Peoples’ Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate the
state of religious freedom and the circumstances surrounding the con-
viction of Archbishop Stepinac. The group, consisting of six clergymen
and two laymen, spent two weeks of intensive inquiry in four of the
six republics of Yugoslavia, and visited the Archbishop in his prison

21

 

THE MELISH CASE

cell at Lepoglava. On their return, the members published a factual
report. This did a good deal to undermine the anti-Yugoslav campaign
that the Vatican was then conducting around the Archbishop’s im-
prisonment. The report gave the background of collaboration with the
Nazis and the facts concerning the Archbishop's post-war anti-govem-
ment activities that led to his conviction, and it punctured the widely-
circulated misstatements about his treatment in prison. For this honest
reporting the members of the group were savagely attacked in the
Roman Catholic press across the country.

As a result of this European trip, Mr. Melish was invited in the late
fall to appear again on the Town Hall of the Air in a? discussion of
“How to Combat Anti-American Propaganda in Europe?” In his
prepared address he advocated a modiﬁcation of the American policy
of containment and coercion, a return to genuine reliance upon the
United Nations and to the use of its relief apparatus and its economic
committees for the stimulation of East-West trade, as the best means
of relieving the growing European tension. The other speakers advised
meeting propaganda with increased counter-propaganda, and urged
greater appropriations by Congress for the “Voice of America” broad-
casts, the dissemination of printed materials in Europe and the step-
ping-up of under-cover activities appropriate to a “cold war.”

One week before the program went on the air, the Attorney-General
of the United States, Mr. Tom Clark, issued the ﬁrst of his infamous
lists of so-called “subversive” organizations. On it was included the Na-
tional Council of American-Soviet Friendship. No reason for its listing
was given and all attempts to obtain a hearing on speciﬁc charges were
refused by the government. While this list technically applied solely
to the screening of employees in the federal service, its existence
swiftly permeated into the whole of American life. The Town Hall of
the "Air did not wish to present a “listed” person on its nationwide
facilities, yet, having announced Mr. Melish as a speaker opposite
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, Representative Case of South" Dakota
and Major General William  Donovan, head of the wartime Office
of Strategic Services, it did not wish to ask him to withdraw lest its
reputation as a genuine forum for the discussion of major issues be
compromised. Major General Donovan, who was also the chairman
of the board of the Town Hall of the Air, resolved the problem by
converting the discussion into a personal attack upon Mr. Melish, ac-
cusing him of being a communist because of his chairmanship of the
National Council and his interest in other organizations concerned

THE FIGHT FOR PEACE

with civil rights and colonial peoples. It was the conjunction of the
“listing” by the Attorney General and this attack by “VVild Bill” Dono-
van on the radio that froze the attitude of the vestry of Holy Trinity
against the assistant minister.

At the previous Vestry meeting in November there had been criticism
of the Yugoslav trip but when Mr. Melish had explained his reason for
going and had pointed out the Roman Catholic origin of the attacks
upon the group, every vestryman had shaken his hand at the close of
the meeting. At the December Vestry meeting, however, there was
cold and implacable hostility. It made no impression upon the Vestry-
men when Dr. Melish expressed his conviction that the Attorney Gen-
eral’s list was utterly illegal and unconstitutional when applied to any
area outside the federal service, and that every American concerned
about traditional civil liberties had to disregard such utter misuse of
it, and oppose such methods of public intimidation. Were he himself
a younger man, he continued, he would do the same work for peace
his son was attempting. America was clearly caught in a wave of
hysteria. He remembered only too well what happened after the First
World War with its Palmer Raids and Deportation Delirium. It was
his belief that this current frenzy was deliberately manufactured and
would prove temporary. The time would come when all who suc-
cumbed to it would look back with dismay, chagrin and shame. His
words fell on deaf ears. A week later an emissary of the vestry came
to Mr. Melish in the rectory and advised him quietly to resign. This
he declined to do. .

The two ministers realized that they were up against a highly
volatile situation complicated by this external atmosphere of hysteria
and war psychosis. To complicate the situation within the parish, the
month of ]anuary in 1948 saw a bitter cold wave and deep snow.
Church attendance fell off badly the next few Sundays, which the
vestry instantly attributed to the assistant minister. Over the protest
of the rector they passed a resolution asking him to resign.

Both ministers began an intensive round of parish calls and activated
members of the Every Member Canvass to help them. They found
among the vast majority of the parishioners a state of perplexity but
not hostility. The people knew and trusted their ministers. All that
was required in most visits was some patient explanation of what the
“listing” meant and did not mean. Attendance at services began to pick
up with the better weather and by Easter Monday the chairman of the
Every Member Canvass reported the largest number of contributors

23

THE MELISH CASE

to the pledge system in the parish’s history. To reduce opportunity for
further criticism Mr. Melish gave up nearly all outside speaking but
found that one speech now drew ten times the publicity.

Though he was conﬁning his energies almost exclusively to the
parish, the National Council was campaigning against the decision of
the motion picture industry, under pressure of the Un—American Com-
mittee of Congress, to produce a series of anti-Soviet ﬁlms. From the
advance studio releases it was clear that these pictures were designed
to inﬂame hatred and to fan the war psychology of the country. When
“The Iron Curtain”—the ﬁrst of these ﬁlms-—was shown in New York,
the Council cooperated with other groups in throwing ,a/ picket line
around the Roxy Theatre. This pattern of protest was copied in other
cities, and was repeated in many Latin American and European
capitals. Box office receipts were disappointing. In spite of some be-
lated Legion of Decency and Catholic War Veteran propaganda in
support of the ﬁlm, the public stayed away and the schedule of similar
productions was sharply curtailed. As chairman of the National Coun-
cil, Mr. Melish was attacked by Mr. Eric Iohnston of the Movie In-
dustry and blasted in such periodicals as Time, Newsweek and Life.
Though he had never referred to the Council from the pulpit, he
thought it wise now to do so, and preached a sermon on “The Church
and Peace,” in which he stated the problem confronting Christians
concerned with contributing to peace in a time when organized
groups were deliberately fanning the ﬂames of suspicion and ill will.

On the strength of this parish calling, the response to the appeal for
pledges, and the reaction to this sermon, the ministers expressed to the
vestrymen their conviction that the strongest element of dissension in
the parish centered in the Vestry itself, and that they were certain these
issues could be worked out with patience within the family. The
ministers were willing to consider all aspects of the problem but the
Vestry must understand that from the ministers’ viewpoint there were
major ethical principles involved. It was not possible to retreat from
this issue of war and peace without compromising the spirit of Chris-
tianity and the tradition of the parish. Nor could one in good conscience
allow one’s self to be intimidated by the Un—American Committee and
Mr. Tom Clark. However, said the ministers, if it became obvious
that the parish could not stand the strain imposed upon it by the
publicity surrounding the chairmanship of the National Council, Mr.
Melish would seriously consider relinquishing it, provided that time
were granted him to work the matter out in such a way that the or-
ganization would not be injured that he had helped to found and in

24

THE FIGHT FOR PEACE

whose work both ministers continued to believe. This step could be
taken at the end of his normal term of ofﬁce as chairman in April.

The vestry responded to this plea for time by producing a letter to
be sent to the parishioners asking whether they considered the “outside
activities” of the assistant minister “detrimental to the parish,” citing
speciﬁcally the chairmanship of the Council and pointing out that
it had been listed as “subversive” by the Attorney General.

A group of parishioners who had gathered something of the ten-
sion that was marking these Vestry meetings came privately to the
rector and asked if they might contest the re-election of the warden
and three vestrymen whose terms of office were to expire on Easter
Monday. Having been through many previous crises in the parish in
his forty-four years, the rector advised against this. He did not wish
any invasion of the Holy Week services by divisive electioneering, and
believed that an irenic attitude on his part could keep the situation
in hand. The issue was not raised at the Annual Meeting either by the
vestrymen or the ministers. Nevertheless, for the ﬁrst time in parish
history two nominations were made from the floor and the two vestry-
men thus challenged were re-elected by less than four votes each. A
resolution was passed requiring that a Nominating Committee be
established before future Annual Meetings so that Vestry nominations
might be more adequately considered by the congregation.

The next morning the vestrymenmailed out their questionnaire and
the wife of one of them called a press conference to which she invited
all the metropolitan newspapers. What had been an issue within the
conﬁnes of the Vestry room up to this point was now not only thrown
out to the entire parish but deliberately broken to the press and
blazoned from coast to coast. She said that Mr. Melish was not a com-
munist but a “half-baked follower of a half-baked Henry Wallace.”
The text of the questionnaire was released. Since this mentioned the
National‘ Council of American-Soviet Friendship and made the chair-
manship the speciﬁc issue, the Melishes felt that this nationwide pub-
licity took away from the assistant minister the option of quietly com-
pleting his term of oﬂice and withdrawing from so exposed a position.
Now he could only resign the chairmanship with loss of principle and
real damage to the Council.

It was at the May meeting of the Vestry following this news-break
that the vestrymen took the formal step of referring the issue between
them and their ministers to the bishop of the diocese. The resolution
was carried by a vote of nine to two. Dr. Melish at once wrote to the
bishop informing him of this resolution and asked that he and his son

25

THE MELISH CASE

be permitted to come out to Garden City and talk the whole matter
out. No reply came. Two months later Dr. Melish received a laconic
note, stating summarily that the bishop had turned the vestry’s letter
over to the chancellor of the diocese.

The summer of 1948 saw the opening of a presidential campaign
with American foreign policy a major issue. There was much agita-
tion for a Third Party among those who felt dissatisﬁed with the posi-
tion of both the old parties. The Melishes found themselves in sym-
pathy with this movement. When the call for a Founding Convention
came, along with other Episcopal clergy Mr. Melish went to Phila-
delphia as a delegate. In the latter part of the summer his father
delivered the invocation at the mammoth rally held by the Progressive
Party in the Yankee Stadium before 50,000 people. The Melishes did
not inject their personal political preferences into the life of the parish.
As election day approached, they simply urged their parishioners to
register and vote as responsible citizens.

VVhat touched off the ﬁnal tempest was Dr. Melish’s invitation to the
Very Reverend Hewlett Iohnson, D.D., Dean of Canterbury Cathedral,
to preach in Holy Trinity. He had both a personal and a public reason
for extending this invitation. VVhen Dr. Iohnson was Dean of Man-
chester Cathedral, he had entertained Dr. Melish who was then tour-
ing England as an exchange preacher and speaking in the major
cathedrals and abbey churches. This was the ﬁrst opportunity to return
the courtesy. More than this, he wished to demonstrate by such an
invitation that the Christian conscience is concerned about the main-
tenance of full exchange of information and the discussion of ideas.

It was a memorable occasion. A queue of waiting people extended
four-deep around the block. The police estimated that 1,500 were
inside the church when the doors were closed" and that more than
500 were turned away. At the rector’s invitation, the vestrymen ushered
and at the close of the service most of them came to the sacristy to
meet the Dean. But ten days later a formal document came to Dr.
Melish from the bishop. In strictly legal language composed by the
chancellor, it informed him that the bishop would make a formal
visitation of the parish for the purpose of examining the state of the
congregation and inspecting the behavior of the clergy.

 

CHAPTER FOUR

A QUESTION OF POLICY

TI1E VESTRY at Holy Trinity, like that of many scattered city congre-
gations, was a self-appointing and self-continuing body. Whenever
vacancies occurred through death or resignation, the rector and Vestry-
men selected individuals from the congregation who were best suited
to serve on the parish’s governing board. Since there were ﬁve build-
ings to be maintained and a considerable endowment fund to be ad-
ministered, it had become the practice to seek men who might have
useful professional experience. Thus the composition of the Vestry
had come to include six lawyers, an investment broker, a varnish
manufacturer, a business manager of a national magazine, a surgeon
and a headmaster of a boys’ school.

VVhen Dr. Melish first came to Holy Trinity, he had made it a condi-

tion that he should be empowered to formulate parish policy in con-
sultation with the vestry and not be simply the executant of a policy
laid down by the Vestry. This initiative in matters of policy had been
respected through the years. The new men brought on the vestry, in
consequence, were chosen primarily with respect to their skills in
caring for the temporalities of the parish. It had been assumed, so
liberal and socially active was the church, that any professional man
who consented to come on the vestry would be in general sympathy
with the parish’s character and tradition. This the congregation had
taken for granted in conﬁrming without question or challenge any
nomination placed before it by the rector and Vestry at the annual
meetings.
\ In the past when differences had arisen, there had always been suf-
ﬁcient liberalism in the Vestry to defend a free pulpit and a vital
 The rector assumed that such would be the case even with
respect to so controversial an issue as peace with Russia. He was
wrong. His good friends on the vestry hardened into a solid opposition
oamp with only one man of the entire eleven defending the traditional
parish principle of freedom for the conscientious minister.

But there was something more to it than Russia. If the views of the
assistant minister were all that bothered the vestrymen, they could
have waited awhile until the rector retired and then have dealt with

27

THE MELISH CASE

the younger man. That they would not wait and turned against their
rector inspite of his forty-ﬁve years of service indicates that they were
determined to take into their own hands the entire formulation of
parish policy. ‘

Holy Trinity stands in the old section of Brooklyn called “The
Heights.” When built a hundred and two years ago as one of the
creations of “The American Gothic Revival,” its ediﬁce graced an at-
tractive residential neighborhood. Drawn into its congregation were
privileged families owning their own homes on the bluff overlooking
New York Harbor. Their incomes were derived from investment bank-
ing, textiles, importing and shipping. I K

Today the neighborhopd has changed. Skyscrapers, small businesses,
hotels, restaurants and bars surround the church. The old brownstone
fronts have yielded to apartment houses, or have been remodeled into
11/2 and 21/2 room ﬂats, or have become multiple rooming houses. The
old families are vanishing. Into their places are moving the more suc-
cessful descendants of the European immigration that preceded the
First World War. The complexion of all Brooklyn, including the
Heights, is increasingly ]ewish and Roman Catholic. Protestantism
is on the decline and the defensive.

Were Holy Trinity the only Episcopal parish on Brooklyn Heights,
it might still attract sufﬁcient Episcopalians from the remaining older
families and Anglo-Saxon stock to keep itself alive. But there are four
other Episcopal churches, all competing for the same dwindling con-
stituency. Under the leadership of the Melishes, Holy Trinity has been
adjusting to these basic facts of life. Located at the transportation hub
of Brooklyn, it has been following four principles.

First, the parish welcomes all who will join the congregation irre-
spective of social, racial, political or religious background, or place of
residence. A

Second, the Episcopal Prayer Book services are conducted in the
liberal and evangelical tradition so as to appeal to a wide variety of
people who ﬁnd themselves responsive to ordered worship and intel-
ligent preaching.

Third, Lenten noonday services bring together prominent ministers
from other protestant denominations in addition to Episcopal clergy,
and each Lent one liberal rabbi is included. The parish seeks to co-
operate with the Protestant Council and to serve as one of the spiritual
rallying-points in the Borough for non-Roman Christianity.

Fourth, the parish buildings are put to community use without
religious test, and the ministers deliberately engage in a wide round

28

 

A QUESTION OF POLICY

of activities that will make the parish known to people and attract
newcomers to membership.

Over the years a steady stream of new faces has entered the doors
of this worshipful church. Strangers have been made welcome without
the presentation of prior credentials, the open communion has been
practiced, and each year there have been afliliations by letter of
transfer, baptism and conﬁrmation. Though there has been a persistent
annual decline in the total membership, statistics of all Brooklyn
protestant churches indicate that Holy Trinity is maintaining its posi-
tion better than most.

Within the congregation four trends are discernible. Individuals of
modest income have been displacing the more socially privileged of
former years. The parish list, once solid with preponderantly English
names, is now generously spotted with those of Continental origin.
Racially, the open door policy has attracted a number of Negro families
who now constitute some 15% of the congregation. There are several
families of American Indian stock. This past year the Hospitality Com-
mittee, made up of women who greet strangers at the door, and the
Ushering Committee have consisted of volunteers drawn from the
entire membership without discrimination. When Dr. Melish first came
to Brooklyn, the support of the parish came from pew rentals and the
deﬁcits were met out of the pockets of the vestry. Today, the backbone
of the budget, apart from the income from endowments and the Easter
Offering, is the regular pledging of some four hundred parishioners
through an envelope system. The Melishes, anticipating an increasingly
diﬂicult future for the parish in the face of changing local conditions,
have advocated this democratization as the best guarantee of its sur-
vival. s 1 —~ I J ;-."‘i":_.r_(“"“‘“‘“"’
When one keeps in mind the self-perpetuating‘ chalractgr ﬁfifhé
Vestry and the successful professional and social status of its members,
it is not diﬂicult to see that quietly over the last decade a cleavage has
been developing between a static Vestry and a changing congregation.

This came to the surface for the ﬁrst time in the winter of 1947 when
Holy Trinity was preparing to observe its Parish Centennial. Three
committees were created out of the entire membership to prepare a
Report on the Past, a Report on the Present, and a Report on the
Future. The chairmanship of these three committees was entrusted to
two members of the Vestry and a close personal friend. These three
men, to a large degree, spearheaded the subsequent moves to get rid
of the Melishes. In the committee sessions criticism was directed by the
chairmen at the social aspects of parish policy and the range of inter-

29

THE MELISH CASE

ests of the ministers. When the Report on the Past was being edited,
they insisted that all references to the outside activities of the ministers
be deleted and that a paragraph approving the continuity of policy
through the succession of the ministers be expunged. The Report on
the Future expressed the hope that post-war apartment construction
and re-zoning would bring into the Heights a new constituency. Three
apartments have gone up but there is no guarantee that their residents
will swell the ancient stock. Every probability is that they will reflect
the cultural trends of Brooklyn.

There is reason to believe that the official arguments used against
the two ministers—namely, their association with organizations listed
by the Attorney General, their “subversive” views on peace with Rus-
sia, and the publicity surrounding their “outside activities”—were not
the sole motivation of the nine vestrymen. They petitioned the bishop
for the dissolution of the pastoral relation with their rector because
they wished to get control of the policy-making power in the parish.
What they desired was the re-orientation of the life of the congrega-
tion into more conventional channels and the re-establishment of the
social character the parish had enjoyed in former years. At the Vestry
meeting at which the petition to the bishop was ﬁnally adopted, one
of the nine vestrymen turned on Dr. Melish and declared: “I speak
not only for myself but for at least two others in this room. The real
basis for our objection is you, sir, and your obstinate insistence upon
your policies. I would.even keep Mr. Melish on as the assistant, pro-
vided you were out and a new rector was elected who would change
the policy.” It did not moderate their attitude to be reminded that
the broad character of the parish long antedated the rector’s coming
and the establishement of his policy, or that the endowment funds, on

 

which they were drawing each year as a source of income, had been I

given -for the explicit perpetuation of a liberal and socially alive parish,

To the nine vestrymen the members of the congregation were less
and less the familiar kind of Heights people with whom the vestrymen
felt at home. The social homogeneity that seemed to them essential
to a successful Episcopal parish was giving way to a diversity that
they considered transient and unreliable. In spite of the most suc-
cessful Every Member Canvass numerically in the history of the parish
and a greater participation in its organized life by its members, the
vestrymen refused to believe that the rank-and-ﬁle cared about the
Episcopal Church and would sacriﬁce to ﬁnance its budget. They
argued that the parish policies would only further alienate those among
their friends who had the means to meet the increasing costs of opera-

30

A QUESTION OF POLICY

 

tion. To their minds there was only one solution: petition to remove
Dr. Melish, ﬁre Mr. Melish, establish a new parish policy, get an
energetic young rector who would follow their directives, and rebuild

Holy Trinity as a fashionable enterprise, appealing for its ﬁnancial P‘

support to other Episcopalians like themselves who found “contro-
versial” issues distasteful. A

The intention of the vestrymen was crudely expressed by the wife
of one of them in the interview she gave the metropolitan papers. Said
she, “A Republican congregation is entitled to a Republican rector.”

Political considerations have never entered into the selection of
vestrymen at Holy Trinity. This statement, however, brought to light
the fact that all eleven vestrymen were of this one political persuasion.
The ministers, on the other hand, were known to be interested in the
Progressive Party. As for the congregation, no one knows its political
views but it is probably safe to infer that the parish runs the entire
spectrum of political allegiance to be found in the community. The
Heights retains a Republican tinge but Brooklyn generally is Demo-
cratic and has always had a considerable Liberal and Progressive
minority. A central downtown church ought to bring within its life a
cross—section of political viewpoints. If its leadership is to be restricted
to one position, as the wife of this vestryman suggested, the future of
the parish will be dependent upon the political weather. This is bad
strategy and incredible Christianity. A parish should have no test for
membership and leadership other than an interest in, and a loyalty to,
the teaching and application of the Christian Faith in the light of the
individual conscience and insight.

This question of the fundamental policy of the parish was an ex-
ceedingly serious matter. It could make or break Holy Trinity. Con-
gregations can be lost overnight but they cannot be created overnight-
especially in a community like Brooklyn where the normal constituency
attracted to the Episcopal Church is on a drastic ebb-tide. To the
ministers the change the vestrymen wanted, while emotionally and
socially understandable, was in reality an anachronism. If only this
policy issue could be deferred until the annual meeting of the parish,
it could be frankly faced. The congregation could express its views.
This is the reason the ministers sought to defer the entire issue until
the annual meeting and stated in public that they would willingly
offer to resign if their policies were not supported. If the congregation
did support them, as they believed it would, it would then be possible
to obtain a more representative Vestry. They knew that two of the
vestrymen were about to retire professionally and would be shortly

31

THE MELISH CASE

leaving the community altogether. With deferment of the issue, it
would not be difficult for the parish to secure a Vestry reflecting its
true wishes, and the whole problem would blow over. But the vestry-
men, realizing that any such deferment would probably result in the
replacement of some of their members, sought to force the issue in
advance of the annual meeting. That is why they appealed to the
bishop. V -

Unfortunately for both mi_nisters and congregation, the bishop was a
man unlikely to be sympathetic towards the policies of the parish. Not
inaccurately he has been described by a prominent Anglo-Catholic
churchman as a “conventional Catholic cultist.” His emphasis since
coming into the diocese has been upon churchmanship, the sacraments,
doctrinal formalism and centralized authority. There were many things
about Holy Trinity that he was bound to ﬁnd distasteful—the parish’s
democratic orientation, its interdenominational tolerance, its interfaith
sympathy, its liberal approach to theology, its openness to progressive
social views, its experimentalism and intellectual hospitality to new
ideas.

Ever since the earliest New Testament days there has been a ten-
dency towards misunderstanding and antagonism between the priestly
and the prophetic outlook. In this historic sense, the bishop of Long
Island may be said to belong to the priestly school; the Melishes stand
in the prophetic line. It is probable that on the ecclesiastical issue
alone the bishop would not have intervened in the internal affairs of
so important a liberal parish as Holy Trinity. Coupled, however, with
a political issue on which the bishop had strong views, the ecclesiastical
issue could scarcely fail to inﬂuence his decision. Here was an oppor-
tunity to rid the diocese of a discordant type of churchmanship and
two troublesome ministers. Only this conclusion can be drawn from
the unwillingness of the bishop to meet with either Dr. or Mr. Melish
personally during the discussion with the vestrymen when the decision
to ask the Melishes’ resignation was being reached. It did not weigh
with the bishop that as “pastor pastorum” he might have some obliga-
tion to protect his clergy from lay intrusion into the conduct of their
priestly and prophetic office, or that the congregation might have some
rights in determining the character of the life of their parish. As
bishops are prone to do, he accepted the information of prominent
vestrymen on its face value. When they told him that the parish could
only survive and be ﬁnanced if the Melishes were removed, he placed
the question of the method of their removal in the hands of his
chancellor.

32

 

A QUESTION OF POLICY

L‘

This was not a good omen, for the hancellor and Dr. Melisl had
crossed swords on many a social issue on the ﬂoor of diocesan conven-
tions for two decades. Colonel Iacks n A. Dykman and the bishop are
intimate personal friends. So strong IS the chancellor’s inﬂuence on the
bishop that many have called him the bishop’s ‘fsuper ego.” Well
versed in Canon Law—for he is also legal adviser to the presiding
bishop-—the Colonel takes a strictly hierarchical view of the structure
of the Episcopal Church. He is in theory and by instinct a “bishop’s
man.” A corporation lawyer, he thinks in corporation terms. The rights
of a congregation in the maintenance of a liberal and democratic
parish to which they have been accustomed are unlikely to concern the
chancellor very greatly. Indeed, in Court he was to take the position
that in the Episcopal Church it is the Vestry, and only the Vestry, that
determines the character and policy of a parish. It is not"a congrega-
tional church—is his contention—and the only speciﬁc right a congre-
gation has,in -his opinion, is the electionof the members of the Vestry
at the annual meeting. _ ~ .

This is to miss the spirit that has made the Episcopal Church a living
religious organism. This spirit is expressed in the maintenance of an
equitable relationship between congregation, Vestry, ministers and
bishop. The life of the people in the pews is the foundation-stone of the
entire structure, the pastoral relation is its central bond, and the
episcopacy is the capstone that provides the symbol and the agent of
the whole body’s organic continuity. When this subtle equity of rela-
tionships is lost, or denied, the historic character of the Episcopal
Church goes with it.

 

CHAPTER FIVE

A STUDY IN PREJUDICE

THE No11cE from the bishop that he was paying a formal‘ visitation
to the parish made it imperative that the Melishes have legal ad-
vice. They sought a lawyer. Person after person theyfapproached
turned them down. There were expressions of personal sympathy but
the facts were simple. The issues, since they had to do with Russia
and the Attorney General’s list, were “hot.” After a long search, a meet-
ing was arranged with Mr. Williarr Mason Smith, Sr. A contemporary
of Dr. Melish, this churchman and lawyer had been a partner of Mr.
Edward M. Shepard who had defended Dr. Crapsey in the famous
Rochester heresy trial, and a friend of Mr. Peabody who had brought
Dr. Melish to Brooklyn. He is a member of the Committee on Canons
of the Diocese of New York and a vestryman of St. Andrew’s on Staten
Island. His son had gone to school with the younger Mr. Melish. Mr.
Smith, Sr. accepted the defense and Mr. Smith, ]r. undertook to assist
his father. ‘

The advice of counsel was that the bishop should be received with
courtesy but that every effort should -be made to get the congregation
represented. Parishioners telephoned the bishop but were informed
that the Vestry was the only legal body with which he could meet.
It was suggested, however, that a written statement might be placed
in the rector’s hands for presentation to the bishop at the visitation.
Such a statement was prepared by the chairman of the Every Member
Canvass detailing the participation of the parishioners and the returns
as being numerically the highest in the parish’s history. A

The visitation took place in the church oflice on December 9, 1948.
Present were the bishop, the chancellor, the rector and the eleven
vestrymen. Although nearly all of what transpired circled around the
activities and the views of the assistant minister, he was not invited
by the bishop to be present. This was a Grand Jury proceeding with
the accused in absentia, a further support to the contention that the
ob Jective was not so much an inquiry into his position and motivation
as it was the alteration of the character of the parish, which involved
primarily the rector and his policies. Nevertheless, in the course of the

34

A STUDY IN PREJUDICE
 

meeting the argument was conﬁned to the assistant minister. Presented
by Mr. Bruce Bromley—shortly to be appointed a Judge of the Court
of Appeals—in his best prosecutor’s style, it contended that the Melishes
were giving aid and comfort to “the enemies” of the country, that the
positions they were taking were driving away the older members of
the parish, that the newcomers in the pews were not genuine Episco-
palians, and that unless something were done at once the ﬁne old
Church of the Holy Trinity would be destroyed. This harangue was
liberally colored with “red-baiting” inferences and implications. At the
close, Dr. Melish turned to the bishop and asked, “in your opinion,
bishop, is this issue essentially theological, ethical, or political?” The
bishop made no reply.

The appearance of Mr. Bromley as the spokesman of the Vestry was
not without interest. He was brought on the vestry six years before
over no little opposition from within the vestry itself, since he was
connected with the parish only through his wife and children. He
rarely attended services. Nevertheless, because he was a successful
and rising corporation lawyer with important Washington connections
and a man of means, several of his lawyer friends on the vestry urged
his election, expressing conﬁdence that this would interest him in the
parish. In the months after his election he was an infrequent attendant
at the Vestry meetings until the issue of the assistant minister began to
simmer, when he appeared regularly in his place. It was his wife who
arranged with Mr. Frederick Woltman, a specialist employed by the
Scripps-Howard New York World Telegram to cover “left-wing” activ-
ities, to hold the press interview that broke the Holy Trinity family
situation out into the newspapers. The same forces that had struck at
other opposition voices to administration policy through the Un-Ameri-
can Committee, the Attorney General and the newspaper smear cam-
paigns but had hesitated to strike directly at two ministers in a central
parish because of public respect for the cloth, had found a backdoor
through the Vestry. A

The bishop’s visitation was formal. Neither the bishop nor the chan-
cellor opened their mouths but simply listened to the statement of the
vesuymen and the reading of a statement by the rector to which the
declaration of the parishioners was attached. Immediately after Christ-
mas, however, the bishop and chancellor consulted with the standing
committee of the diocese and obtained a resolution recommending
that both ministers resign from Holy Trinity. On the day before the
January Vestry meeting, Dr. Melish was summoned by telegram to
meet the bishop in a private conference at Christ Church, Clinton

THE MELISH CASE

Street. At this meeting the bishop read him the resolution of the stand-
ing committee but hastened to add, “This is not my judgment. I was not
personally present when the vote was taken and am no party to it.”

The next night at the Vestry meeting the whole ground of the con-
troversy was gone over for the last time. One vestryman, who later
refrained from voting, begged that the issue be deferred to the parish
meeting in April when the congregation could have a chance to say
something about the matter. This recommendation was voted down.
The rector stated that, in his opinion, the proposed resolution would
be uncanonical and illegal; it would be unethical in that it violated
a contract between the assistant minister and the parish: it was un-
charitable, inasmuch as they had known him since he was a boy; and
it was unrepresentative of the parish, which would surely repudiate
the entire Vestry if the opportunity were ever given it to do so. The
treasurer of the parish, Mr. Allen M. Taylor, who was the one op-
ponent of the resolution, then stated his position: “I am voting against
this resolution not because I agree with the ministers but because
I still believe the principle of liberty is of such importance that it must
be upheld. Any damage that has been done this parish by the assistant
minister is as nothing compared with that which will be done by the
passage of this resolution. You gentlemen have no conception of the
storm of protest that you will bring down upon your heads.” His words
were greeted with stony silence. The vote was taken, nine in the af-
firmative, one abstention, and one in the negative to which the rector
added his-9 to 2. The resolution was adopted petitioning the bishop
to dissolve the pastoral relation between the Church of the Holy
Trinity and the Reverend John Howard Melish, D.D., LL.D., its rector
for forty-ﬁve years. ,

In the midst of the meeting while the discussion was still going on,
to the surprise of all present the sound of militant hymns began to
reverberate through the parish house. When the resolution had been
passed, the sober ministers emerged from the rector’s study to ﬁnd
seventy-ﬁve -members of the parish gathered in the kindergarten room.
Suspecting that a crisis was at hand, they had come to show their sup-
port of their ministers. When the news of what had actually happened
was told them, there was an outburst of angry resentment. Then and
there was formed “The Committee to Retain the Rector.’

This Committee began a canvass of all the families in the parish
and in a few days’ time obtained 821 signatures to the following
statement:

A STUDY IN PREIUDICE

“We, the undersigned members of Holy Trinity parish, are
completely opposed to the action of the oestry in asking for
the resignation of our rector, Dr. John Howard Melish.

“We have the utmost affection for Dr. Melish and approve
the policy he has consistently followed for the 45 years of
his rectorship. We state that the vestry in this action in no
way represents our sentiments.”

Since the number of eligible voters in the parish was 446, this repre-
sented an expression of some 70% of the legal membership. This in-
formation was immediately transmitted to the Vestry and to the bishop
in the hope that action might be deferred until the parish meeting.
It made no impression. The vestrymen proceeded to ﬁle their petition
with the bishop and he acknowledged its receipt by ordering a hearing
before the standing committee of the diocese on February 15, 1949,
in the Cathedral House at Garden City.

The bishop telephoned Mr. Melish to meet him at once in the
diocesan house. He told him that as a father with sons, he could under-
stand Dr. Melish’s desire to stand by his boy. When he had talked with
Dr. Melish at Christ Church, Clinton Street, and read him the resolu-
tion of the standing committee, he had noticed a wistful look in his
eye, as if he were pleading, ‘Would that my boy would relieve me
of this burden!” “If you will only offer to resign,” continued the bishop,
“I think I can persuade the Vestry to withdraw their petition. That
will permit your father to continue for the present as rector. Since he
is physically incapable of carrying on without help, we can supply him
temporarily with an assistant. Then, when this unhappy affair has
blown over, he may retire normally with all the honors due him for his
long service, and the parish may move ahead.”

Mr. Melish attempted to get in a few words about the character of
the parish and what it had stood for, asking, “Doesn’t the congregation
have some rights in the determination of this matter?” “I think not,”
replied the bishop. “I cannot for a moment believe that such upright
and outstanding men as are on your Vestry do not know what is best
for the parish. I am ready to take their word. I think both you and
your father have been misguided in what you have done. The primary
function of the Church is to provide people with a place to worship
and receive the sacraments. To me, your basic error is not so much
your political views or even the chairmanship of the Council as it is
that you, and your father as well, have compromised the Christian
priesthood. By all kinds of activities which are controversial in charac-

THE MELISH CASE

ter you have made it difficult for loyal churchmen conscientiously to
come to church and to receive the sacraments. It is this violation of
your priesthood that I hold against you.”

When Mr. Melish reported this conversation to his father, they
prepared a brief letter indicating Mr. Melish’s unwillingness to resign
on any such basis and stating that they had reached this joint decision
“for the good of the Church.” Dr. Melish took the letter and drove to
Garden City. He said to the bishop, “We are both in the hands of
lawyers. This situation cannot be resolved by recourse to law. As an
older man venturing to speak out of a lifetime of experience in the
ministry, I have seen two of the finest parishes in Elie Episcopal
Church smashed by the mishandling of just such an issue as this. The
same can easily happen at Holy Trinity. I ask that you let this be
worked out within the parish.” He handed the bishop the letter.

It was bad enough to know that the proposed hearing would take
place before a standing committee that had already committed itself
to asking for the resignation of both ministers. To make the situation
even more unfavorable, on the Sunday before the hearing, Bishop
DeWolfe ordered that prayers for Cardinal Mindszenty be said in the
parishes and missions of the diocese, and that a pastoral letter be read
in all services. This letter extolled the Cardinal as “a martyr, a Christian
martyr, a martyr of the whole human race”; it referred to the “trumped
up” charges against Archbishop Stepinac; and it employed this militant
language about communism:

“The day of decision is at hand. Communism is anti-religious. It
is anti—Christian because it denies God. It is anti-Christian because
it denies the Christian doctrine of rnan—-his digni , his free will, his
soul, that he is a son of God. It is anti-Christian ecause it rules by
fear, whereas Christ rules through love. It is diabolical because it is
anti-God and anti-man. None of its mouthed social material beneﬁts,

‘ even though they were facts instead of promises, could compensate
for the denial of human personality. ,

“All men everywhere must rise up and withstand its insidious
penetration, for very humanity’s sake. We Americans possess political
and economic blessings that are the envy of the world; but we must
awake to the cankering worm among us, lest it rot those very
blessings. But Christians have a peculiar obligation to resist Com-
munism. It threatens not only intelectual integrity and physical
freedom; it numbs men's souls. It is Communism which is the opium
of the people, not Christianity. It says, in effect, ‘Give us your free-
dlgm apd we will make you gods.’ Instead, it has made its followers
s ves.

No one in the diocese could have the slightest doubt as to where the
bishop stood. He had accepted on its face value the Vatican statements

38

 

A STUDY IN PREJUDICE

on Mindszenty and Stepinac without any qualiﬁcation, in spite of ‘

thoroughly authenticated facts that ought to have given him some
hesitation, and he was adopting the extreme position on communism
in deﬁance of the cautious and discriminating statements issued by
his own Communion at the Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops,
at which he was not present because of illness. Nor was he heeding
the warning of the meeting of the House of Bishops in Winston-Salem
against the spread of the current hysteria and its attendant persecution
of individuals.

This was the atmosphere in which the hearing at Garden City
opened, with all the members of the standing committee fully aware
that the bishop had committed himself and the diocese to the posi-
tion that a holy war was on, in which no quarter was admissible.

The position of the Melishes rested on the contention that this could
not be safely or intelligently treated as an all-out holy war but required
restraint and patience to sift out the wheat from the chaff in the ten-
sions and conﬂicts involved. The standing committee was caught in
an impossible position. If it sympathized with the Melishes, it slapped
the bishop. If it sided with the bishop, it removed two sincere ministers
dealing with a fundamental issue. It is not surprising that the mood
around the hearing table was one of glum silence on the part of the
clerical members with the chancellor and the lay members taking the
lead. Unfortunately for the Melishes, the advantage of being on the
popular bandwagon lay with the bishop. They were in the unpopular
minority position. VVhich of the men-the bishop or the ministers-was
closer to the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount and the Beatitudes
of Christ, readers of the New Testament will judge. Under the pro-
cedure being followed, it was this bishop who would be the “ﬁnal
judge and arbiter” of the vestrymen’s appeal.

The hearing was conducted behind closed doors with the press ex-
cluded. Judge Bromley presented‘ the case for the nine vestrymen.
There were two charges: ﬁrst, that the rector was 73, his health im-
paired and his physical condition such that in the opinion of the vestry
he was no longer able to fulﬁl the duties of his oflice; and, second, that
dissension had broken out in the parish because of his refusal to dis-
charge his son and assistant whose outside activities were detrimental
to the parish. Mr. William Mason Smith Sr. represented the rector and
put in evidence a statement by Dr. Melish’s physician that his health
was excellent and the signed statements of the 321 parishioners re-
pudiating the action of the nine vestrymen. The basic argument of the
defense was that the bishop had no canonical jurisdiction in this matter

39

THE MELISH CASE

since the clear meaning of Long Island Canon 27 (and General Canon
46) was that a dispute must exist between a parish and its rector to
be adjudicable by the bishop. No such dispute existed between the
parish and its rector but only a sharp difference of opinion between the
Vestry and the ministers.

Sixty members of “The Committee to Retain the Rector” were pres-
ent and some dozen testiﬁed to the healthy state of the parish, the
attendance at services, ﬁnancial giving and organizational life, indicat-
ing that conditions were on a par with the best in the last ten years.
The Rev. Walter Russell Bowie, D.D., Dean of Union Theological
Seminary, was called to the stand and a letter from the Rt. Rev Wil-
liam Scarlett, D.D., Bishop of Missouri, was read in evidence, and a
list was presented indicating numerous other clergymen and laymen
who were ready to give corroborative testimony as to the character of
the Melishes and that what they were accused of was not a subject
of diocesan discipline. The limitations of the hearing have been de-
scribed in the Church Press by the Suﬁragan Bishop of Newark, the
Rt. Rev. Theodore R. Ludlow, D.D.:

“I attended the two day hearing given by the standing committee
of the diocese of Long Island at the Cathedral House in Garden City
to the complaint of the vestry of Holy Trinity Church, in Brooklyn,
against the rector of that parish, Dr. ]ohn Howard Melish, concerning
the outside activities of his son and assistant, the Rev. William Howard
Melish.

“As one who was largely inﬂuenced by Dr. Melish in entering the
ministry, my interest was more than academic. I sat through the pro-
ceedings with a sense of incredulous shame that anyone claiming to
be a Christian, and knowing Howard Melish, even slightly, could bring
charges of any kind against him. That tinge of regretful shame was
reflected in the attitude of. the standing committee and in the testimony
of complainants and respondents alike. It soon became evident that it
was not Howard Melish but the fellowship of the Christian Church
which was on trial. Some there were who were not willing to remain
in fellowship with one whose political and economic ideas, as expressed
through the son outside the Church were not in agreement with
their own. There was no charge of heresy or of immorality or of dis-
loyalty to priestly vows, but simply incompatibility of temperament
cloaked by the word ‘dissension.’ The other charge, that of being over-
age, was denied by the certiﬁcate of Dr. Melish’s physician and the
matter was quietly dropped even by the complainants. Even the word
‘dissension’ tended to become ‘difference of opinion’ as the evidence
developed. But, of course, there will always be differences of opinion

40

 

A STUDY IN PBEIUDICE

concerning the gospel. ‘I came not to send peace, buta sword.’ ‘Woe
unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! For so did their fathers
to the false prophets.’

“An immediate reflection concerning the hearing was the large part
taken by laymen, even if one could not always approve of the way they
played their part. At least they were there. The hearing was not con-
ducted by a member of the hierarchy nor by a governmental minister
of religion. We can be thankful that in our Church each branch of the
fellowship has an equal responsibility for the well-being of the whole
fellowship. As long as that is true, we will avoid the pitfalls of cleri-
calism. I have said each branch of the fellowship has an equal respon-
sibility, and yet, the astonishing fact is that, according to my recollec-
tion, not a clerical member of the standing committee asked a question
or made a comment during the two days of the hearing. The one ex-
ception was the chairman, and his remarks were in the course of his
job as presiding officer. Were they so unhappy about the situation of a
fellow priest that they could not say anything? One hopes that was
the reason for their silence. One would hate to think it was because
they were willing or accustomed to having ‘big’ laymen manage their
affairs for them. . . .

“While the word Communism was used in the hearing, it was used,
as is too widely the case today, as an epithet and not as a term having
an understood and deﬁned meaning. There was absolutely no attempt
to deﬁne Communism in the hearing. It was taken for granted that it
would be understood by everyone present as something vicious and
treasonable to the nation. This, too, in spite of the report prepared
after careful consideration by a sub-committee at the Lambeth Con-
ference last summer, which attempted to avoid such an unintelligent
and hysterical use of the word. As secretary of that sub-committee, I
speak with some knowledge of what the conference had in mind.

“But better than any personal recollection are the resolutions of the
conference itself, adopted by the 329 bishops who were gathered from
all over the world, most of them from far beyond the grip of hysteria
that now agitates our country. Resolution 25 and 26 read as follows:

“25. The Conference holds that while a state must take the precau-
tions it regards as necessary to protect good order and peace from all

‘subversive movements, it is the special duty of the church to oppose

the challenge of the Marxian theory of communism by sound teaching
and the example of a better way, and that the church, at all times and
in all places, should be a fearless witness against political, social and
economic injustice.

“26. The Conference believes that communism presents a challenge
to Christian people to study and understand its theory and practice,
so that they may be well instructed as to which elements in it are in

41

T'HE MELISH CASE

conflict with the Christian view of man and must therefore be re-
sisted, and which elements are a true judgment on the existing social
and economic order. '

“In a long-term policy to win the workers for the Kingdom of Christ,
and to win them from a policy based on materialism, churchmen must
begin by entering into the despair as well as the hope that has inspired
modern communism. They must proclaim human rights without

 

equioocation. They must practice corporately what they preach and ‘

so cleanse the household of faith that the spirit of God is able to wbrk
through it with power. ’

“Secondly, they must do full justice to the truth in com unism, both
its critical insights into history and its desire to help e oppressed.
The church ought not to allow itself to be identiﬁed with social reac-
tion. Its members should be ready for social and economic change
and quick to welcome into the councils of the church men and women
with the workers’ experience of living conditions.

“Thirdly, they must realize that those who accept an economic
theory of communism as distinct from Marxian atheism do not thereby
put themselves outside the fellowship of Christ’s church. Experiments
in communal living have always been a feature of the life of the
church, and in our times its life and witness are being strengthened
by fresh ventures of this kind.“

CHAPTER SIX

ENMESHED IN THE LAW

IX DAYS after the hearing, while the standing committee was still
Spreparing its report, the Brotherhood of St. Andrew held its annual
corporate communion for the men and boys of the diocese. The bishop
made this the occasion for a militant attack on communism. Where the
Melishes had expressed their political opinions outside the church, the
bishop had no hesitation about expressing his within the church, in-
truding his personal views into the worship and even the prayers of
his parishes, and the communion breakfasts of the diocese.

Members of the standing committee were present. If there remained
any doubt as to what the bishop expected of them, it was now more
than clear. This was grim warning to the Melishes that the dice were
loaded. Their appeal to reason and restraint was running into a head-
on collision with blind emotion and intolerance.

“The Committee to Retain the Rector”—many of whose members
heard the bishop-—realized that unless a ﬁght were put up at once, not
only would they lose their ministers but the character of their parish
would be smashed to pulp before their eyes. There might be dif-
ferences of opinion about peace with Russia but this un-Christian
spirit was quite another matter. It threatened everything that had
made them ardent supporters of Holy Trinity.

“The Committee” needed legal assistance and secured as counsel a
Brooklyn lawyer with experience in the civil rights ﬁeld, Mr. Raphael
H. Weissman. He consulted with the Smiths, father and son. After
careful study of the Religious Corporations Act of the State of New
York and many court decisions, the attorneys advised the Committee

that there was legal precedent, sustained by the Court of Appeals, for‘

the removal of officers of a religious corporation who had failed to
act legitimately as the agents of the congregation that had elected
them, and that a special meeting of the parish for this purpose might
he demanded by the congregation and called by the rector. There was
just one technical diﬂiculty. The statute for the Episcopal Church said
that the day for a special meeting must be ﬁxed by the Vestry. How-
ever, it is well-established in both common and corporate law that
this type of statutory requirement may be waived when it is the sole

43

THE MELISH CASE

 
 :::——

barrier to the calling of a meeting to remove a body that will not assist
in its own removal. On February 26, 1949, the rector read to the con-
gregation a demand from the parishioners that such a meeting be
called, and set March 7, 1949, as the date for a special meeting to hear
charges against the nine vestrymen and to vote on their removal. It
was fully appreciated that this action would probably precipitate the
bishop’s Judgment.

The Lenten season began on March 2nd with the opening of the
Community Lenten Noonday Services at Holy Trinity. The suffragan
bishop of the diocese was the opening preacher. After the service he
was lunching with Dr. Melish in the rectory when the doorbell rang.
The suffragan hastily excused himself. Two emissaries from Garden
City delivered a package containing the bishop’s Iudgment dissolving
the pastoral relation between Dr. Melish and the parish, and establish-
ing his pension rights. The parish was to match his stipend from the
Church Pension Fund with an equal amount. Attached to the Judg-
ment was a Memorandum and the Report of the standing committee.
These three documents were simultaneously released to the metro-
politan press.

It was Ash Wednesday indeed at Holy Trinity. The ministers were
generally prepared for the decision but did not anticipate its delivery
until after Ash Wednesday was past. For this indecent haste the bishop
had a reason. Under the Canon the dissolution could not take place
for thirty days and it was vital to the execution of the plan that it
precede the annual meeting of the parish on Easter Monday. The
pastoral relation would be terminated on April 4th, a good two weeks
in advance of the parish meeting. This would remove the rector. The
old vestry would still be in the saddle and would then ﬁre the assistant
minister. The bishop would be asked to send in a clergyman to conduct
the Holy Week and Easter services. It might not be necessary to hold
an annual parish meeting, since there would be no rector to call it,
but, if it had ‘to be held, the congregation would be faced with an
accomplished fact and the Vestry would be sustained. Dr. Melish
would be more than adequately cared for in his old age (though how
the parish was going to raise this additional tax was apparently never
calculated) and the younger Mr. Melish would not have his clerical
status impaired but would be safely out on the street. Holy Trinity
would become a conventional and politically safe parish in the heart
of Brooklyn.

The three published documents—the bishop’s Judgment, the Memo-
randum and the Report of the standing committee-,-deserve a detailed

44

study. They are extremely interesting, The Report rejects the ﬁrst
count that Dr. Melish is too old, but sustains the second charge that
there is serious dissension in the parish because he has not removed
his assistant. Violating a fundamental principle in jurisprudence, it
asserts that by failing to take the stand in their own defense, the two
ministers concede the truth of all the statements contained in the news-
paper “evidence” submitted. Then the standing committee states the
real reason for its decision. The Report quotes this statement  Mr.
George F. Kennan, chief moulder of American State Department
policy towards Russia:
“By the same token, exhibitions of indecision, disunity and in-
ternal disintegration within this country have an exhilarating effect
on the whole Communist movement. At each evidence of those ten-
dencies, a thrilling hope and excitement goes through the Communist
world; a new jauntiness can be noted in the Moscow trend; new
grou s of foreign supporters climb on what they can only view as

the andwagon of international politics; and Russian pressure in-
creases all along the line in international aifairs.”

The standing committee then makes this fundamental admission:

“We therefore approach the question before us upon the
basis ﬁrst, that Communism is incompatible with the Chris-_
tian Faith and second, that there must be no exhibition of
indecision, disunity or internal disintegration within this
country in the disposition to be made of the question be-
fore us.

“We further ﬁnd that the activities of the Assistant
Minister as chairman of the National Council of American-
Sooiet Friendship have been most detrimental to the wel-
fare not only of .the Parish but also the Church in the
diocese and nation.

“A priest of the Church whose activities leave‘ doubt as
to his attitude toward Communism must inevitably cause
dissension in his Parish and bring scandal to the Church.”

No enquiry was made into what Mr. Melish’s real attitude was, nor,
as Bishop Ludlow has indicated, was the term “communism” so much
as deﬁned. The real substance of the standing committee’s conclusion
boils down to this: a war is on, and anyone who does not accept the
oﬂicial governmental position but criticizes it in any way, puts himself
in the position of being an enemy and subverter of the State. For a
Christian to speak out for Peace is subversive. There is not the slightest
recognition that the State Department might be wrong in some judg-
ment, or that administration policy might possibly be ill-informed or

45

 

THE MELISI-I CASE

  

misguided, or that the Church might have the function, even in a
negative political situation, to proclaim the ethical ideal of human
relationships as Christ has taught them. Caesar has spoken. The
Church must render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s. There is
no mention of what the Church may owe to God. _

In the Report, which the bishop later testified was written by the
chancellor, some extraordinary charges are levelled against Mr. Melish
as samples of his “detrimental outside activities.” He wrote an article
in The Churchman on the state of religion in the Soviet Union. It did
not mention that the material paralleled the report brought back from
Moscow by the Archbishop of York, Dr. Cyril Garbett. *He wrote an
article for The Sunday Worker. It did not mention that this article was
requested by this paper so that its readers might know the facts
about Dr. Garbett’s Russian mission, and that the material used in its
preparation was supplied by 281 Fourth Avenue—-the Episcopal head-
quarters—after Mr. Melish had consulted with their publicity depart-
ment as to the desirability of publishing an essentially religious article
in a communist weekly and had been assured it could only be helpful.
»In 1946 he chaired a dinner for the Brooklyn Division of Russian War
Relief. The Report conveniently omitted that the chairman of the
Brooklyn Division was Mr. Hunter L. Delatour, and two members of
the executive board were Colonel Jackson A. Dykman and the Hon.
Edward A. Richards—all three members of the very standing commit-
tee that compiled the Report. It omitted to say that Suffragan Bishop
Larned of the diocese had delivered the invocation at one of these
rallies and that the diocesan Department of Christian Social Relations
had sponsored the local Russian Relief program. Under oath in the
Supreme Court, Mr. Melish later testified that Bishop DeWolfe himself
had phoned him at Lake George in the midst of his summer vacation
and asked him to come two hundred miles to the city to represent the
bishop at a city-wide meeting of Russian War Relief, which, at great
personal inconvenience, he had gladly done. Yet such diocesan ap-
proved activities were now being thrown in his face as “charges.”
Such are the depths of hypocrisy to which laymen and even a bishop
can descend under the impact of a “cold war” and a hysteria run riot,
when memories conveniently forget.

The Memorandum attached to the bishop’s Judgment criticized the
company that Mr. Melish had kept in his activities for peace. Ignoring
the common rules of grammar, it stated that he associated with
“atheists, Communists, agitators of world revolution, totalitarianism
and almost every article which denies the Christian doctrine of man.”

46

ENMESHED IN THE LAW
 

As horrendous examples of these dreadful people the Report had listed
Dr. Corliss Lamont, a humanist teacher of philosophy at Columbia
University, whom Mr. Melish had succeeded as chairman of the Na-
tional Council and whose father had just given a half million dollars
to the rebuilding of Canterbury Cathedral and its Schools; Mr. Leo
Linder, an attorney who is the co-chairman of the Progressive Party
in Brooklyn and an authority on Federal Health Legislation; and Mr.
]oseph Kehoe, secretary-treasurer of the American Communications
Association, for whose progressive union Mr. Melish three years run-
ning had been asked to open national conventions with prayer.

No better answer was given to the bishop’s Memorandum than a
column in a New York afternoon paper by its Washington political
commentator, Mr. I. F. Stone:

IMAGINARY BISHOP

The Rev. Dr. John Howard Melish is 74 years old. He has been rector of Holy
Trinity Church, Brooklyn, for 45 years. In the latter years of his ministry, he
erred.

What were his errors? The error which got him into trouble was loyalty to
his son, who was also his assistant rector. What was the son’s error? He was
accused of associating with “reputed atheists, Communists, agitators. . . .”

Dr. Melish refused to discharge his son. Dr. Melish’s bishop has therefore re-
moved him as rector, and removed him before Dr. Melish’s own church members
could make their 0 inion felt at the annual parish elections in April. I can imagine
a bishop who wou d have acted differently.

“I do not approve the activities of Dr. Melish’s son ” I can hear this bishop
tell a delegation come to ask for the rector’s removal, But I cannot say that I
res ect a man less for declining to abandon his son in the face of popular clamor.

‘ Many people feel that the association of the son with Communists, and pro-
Soviet organizations has hurt the Church. I am inclined to think I would be doing
the Church greater harm if I were to remove a venerable priest under the cir-
cumstances.

“Let us suppose that Dr. Melish is wholly in error. After so many years of ser-
vice, does he not merit a little Christian forgiveness? Should we not be in greater
error if we did not extend it?

I can see the bishop fall silent, get up and walk to look out upon his lawn. I A

canseehimtumagainwithawry e.

“I do not defend oung Melish’s associations," the bishop continues. “I do not
myself associate wi ‘reputed atheists, Communists, agitators.’ Perhaps I would
be a better Christian if I did.

“I make no com arisons but I think we might remember that these were the
descriptions applie to the First Followers. Our faith was born among the despised
and the outcast. Maybe it can only be revitalized from the same sources. Perhaps
this is the inner meaning of ‘Blessed are the Persecuted.’

“The liberties of the whole Church are threatened here.
Which is to prevail in the Episcopal Church—the courage
of ministers who are trying as God gives them grace to
interpret the Gospel of Christ in a troubled time and the
loyalty and love of a congregation that sustains them: or
the power of a repudiated vestry and an unfriendly bishop
to invoke canonical and civil legalisms that destroy the
loyalties built up through many years?”

“The ecclesiastical apparatus of the Diocese of Long
Island . . . has professionally ‘lynched’ two ministers who
entertain unpopular opinions. It is actually ‘here’ now.
Thought control! Regimentation of opinion! Suppression of
opposition and criticism! The Melish Case is going to be-
come a Dreyfus Aﬁaire in the Episcopal Church. Every
Episcopalian and every American stands in jeopardy be-
cause of it. . . . Read this booklet and weep for your
Church and your American ideals! Then get ﬁghting mad!”

women to whom Dr. Melish has become a symbol of all
that is noblest and highest in the Christian ministry. This
church has risen above custom. It has been a city set on a
hill! The people of this parish have seen his worth, caught
his vision, given him a free pulpit and free hand and have
backed him and worked with him to accomplish his great
goals. A great people as well as a great minister make a
great parish.” -

THE MELISH CASE
,.

 

"Certainly the test of a man’s faith is what he is willing to risk for it. By that
standard, the Melishes do not come out too poorly.

“Young Melish is chairman of the National Council of American-Soviet Friend-
ship. I hold no brief for this organization. I know little about it. But I do know
there is a debate underway over the issues of war and peace.

“There are few—too few-voices raised on the side of peace. These few may
be misguided but I have too much faith in free discussion to believe it wil
hurt us to hear them.

“I would not have it appear that m Church helped to stiﬂe some of those few.
I would not want it said abroad that e war fever had risen‘ so high in my country
that two ministers who favored American-Soviet friendship were/Nremoved from
their posts. I would not have it said that the Church worships the Prince of Peace
but punishes those who try to apply his teachings in practice.”

Too bad for the church, that mine is the imaginary bishop.

By a striking coincidence, on March 15, 1949, there appeared in all
the New York papers a story from England quoting a statement by

the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend and Right Honor-

able Geoffrey Francis Fisher, D.D., as to why he did not remove the

Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, from his post. Said the
Archbishop:

“Since it is frequently asked why the Dean is not re-
moved from his office because of his opinions, I must
say, ﬁrst, that for removal from oﬂice the law requires
trial and conviction in some civil or ecclesiastical court,

» and that the Dean has not rendered himself liable to a
charge in either court. Secondly, in this country we
greatly value the right to freedom of speech and the law
is slow to curtail it, even when it proves inconvenient,

' irksome or hurtful. Its suppression is one of the grave
charges against those totalitarian and police states which
enjoy the Dean’s conﬁdence.”

How curious that Mr. I. F. Stone’s “Imaginary Bishop” should turn
up in England in an established Church and not in an independent
Christian Communion in the Land of the Free and the Home of the
Brave!

The publication of the bishop’s Judgment did not deter the congre-
gation from proceeding with the special meeting. 350 parishioners
attended with almost the entire metropolitan press watching the
gathering. Formal charges were laid against the nine vestrymen,

48

ENMESHED IN THE LAW

 

evidence was submitted in support of the charges, opportunity was
given for rebuttal and discussion, and then a vote was taken. 261
voted to remove the nine vestrymen. 27 voted for their retention. This
10-to-1 tally is especially notable because it constituted not only a re-
pudiation of the nine vestrymen but a direct rejection of the bishop's
interference in the life of the parish. By this action the congregation
was standing on its rights and demanding that they be respected.
Having removed the nine vestrymen, the congregation confronted
the rector with the Religious Corporations Act which says that when
no quorum of the Vestry exists, the rector shall call a special meeting

L‘ to ﬁll the vacancies. On Sunday, March 13, 1949, notice was read at
divine service that a special meeting was called for March 14th for

the purpose of ﬁlling the unexpired terms of the nine vest_rymen who
had been removed.

Anticipating that this might be the next move of the congregation,
the nine vestrymen had the papers prepared to seek a Court injunction
against the ministers and the committee of the congregation. The mo-
ment the notice of the special meeting was read on Sunday, the vestry-
men went into Court on Monday morning and ﬁled the papers. Mr.
Theodore Kiendl, a prominent attorney, was retained to represent
them. The Court granted a restraining order preventing the holding
of the special election and set the day for a hearing on the petition of
the vestrymen for a permanent injunction. The nine vestrymen asked
to be reinstated and that their right to function as vestrymen be
sustained. By bringing in the bishop as a party-defendant, they also
asked the Court to enforce the bishop’s order of dissolution. It is im-
portant to note that it was the nine vestrymen who sought recourse to
the law.

The hearing took place before Judge Alfred Norton in a crowded
courtroom. After a presentation of the positions of the four parties to
the action, the judge issued a temporary injunction holding all things
in statu quo pending the rendering of a court decision, and set Easter
Monday, April 18, 1949 (the date of the annual parish meeting) as the
date of the trial. In other words, the congregation had won the right
to hold its annual meeting and the rector could be in the chair—the
very thing the old Vestry had been seeking to avoid and the dating of
the bishop’s Judgment had been so careful to preclude. The congrega-
tion had gained the ﬁrst essential objective in its ﬁght to retain its
ministers, but now, unfortunately, by this action of the Vestry, both
ministers and people found themselves enmeshed in the Law.

CHAPTER SEVEN

A FIGHTING CONGREGATION

THERE WAS grim tension in the atmosphere of Holy Trinity. The
THoly Week services were of a kind not soon to be forgotten. On
Maundy Thursday it has been the custom to hold an evening celebra-
tion to commemorate the Institution of the Lord’s Supper and to

distribute a white rose to each communicant. Dr. Melish, knowing that

it might be his last occasion to speak to his flock in the intimacy of the
family circle, in a few simple words thanked them for their, loyalty to
the spirit of Christ. In the darkened church, as the parishioners, many

with tear-ﬁlled eyes, moved forward into the light around the altar ,

where the two ministers moved along the communion raﬂ followed by
the vested young men distributing the roses, the organist began to
improvise softly on the Negro spiritual, ‘Were You There When They
Cruciﬁed My Lord?” V

The Three Hour Service on Good Friday was shared by the two
ministers, as they had done for years, alternating the addresses on the
Seven Words. There was no reference to what was taking place in the
parish but the old story of man’s inhumanity to man unfolded with
dreadful solemnity. Few left the church until the ﬁnal singing of “In
The Cross Of Christ I Glory.”

On Easter Sunday, for the ﬁrst time since he came, to Holy Trinity
Mr. Melish preached the main Easter sermon to a congregation half
again larger than that of the previous year. He took as his text the
great passage from Second Esdras: ‘

“F or unto you is paradise opened, the tree of life is planted, the
time to come is prepared, plenteousness is made ready, a city is
builded, and rest is allowe , yea, perfect goodness and wisdom:
sorrows are passed, and in the end is showed the treasure of im-
mortality.”
He ended the sermon with a prayer that he had been asked to write
many years before by the Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation for
its annual meeting: . _

“O God, who in thy Holy Word hast taught us that the ﬁgure of
the city is our clearest symbol of the life to come, and hast shewn us
that the ﬁner bonds of sentiment betoken the Eternal Virtues; Grant

50

A FIGHTING CONGBEGATION
 

that we may live in this our city as expectant pupils, learning daily
the lessons of the soul, discovering the rich deposits of our better
natures, ﬁnding our own true selves in the service of our fellows
amidst the toil and conflict, joys and sorrows of this city's life: so
that, growing steadily in understanding of the things eternal, we ma
mediate them to our troubled times, and achieve them for our worl ,
that life among us may provide a sweeter foretaste of that heavenly
city’: life, where our reward shall be to dwell with thee."

The next morning the trial opened in the Supreme Court of Kings
County before judge Meyer Steinbrink. The room was jammed with
spectators so that the doors had to be closed. Parishioners, interested
clergymen from many parishes and other protestant churches, spec-

‘ tators and the press ﬁlled every seat and overﬂowed into the area re-

served for the attorneys as well as into the unused jury box.

Theodore Kiendl presented the case for the vestrymen. He asserted
that there was grave dissension in the parish; that the vesirymen had
done their duty in seeking the advice and counsel of the bishop; and
that the bishop had found them justified in asking for the dissolution
of the pastoral relation and had acted upon their petition. In con-
sequence, his clients had been most unjustly penalized by members of
the congregation who illegally and in direct deﬁance of their bishop
had held a trial and attempted to remove them from office and replace

. them with others. He asked that the Court declare the special meeting

illegal, forbid a new election, sustain his clients in the exercise of their
oiﬁces, and enforce the bishop's Judgment.

Colonel Dykman represented the bishop and the diocese. He argued
that everything had been done in conformity with the strict letter of
the Canons of the diocese and the General Church. The Vestry was
the corporate body in the Episcopal Church and the only legal entity
entitled to act. This was an Episcopal and not a congregational Church.
He emphasized this point, “Thank God!”

The position of the two ministers and the congregation was presented
by their attorneys, the two Smiths and Mr. Weissman. Their funda-
mental contention was that the General Canons speciﬁcally state that
the vestry is the agent and the representative of the parish, and that the
vestry may not properly request a dissolution that neither the parish
nor the ministers desire. The bishop and the Vestry were fully aware
that 321 parishioners had repudiated the action of the vestry in ﬁling
the petition for dissolution. The vestrymen, in proceeding with the
petition in direct deﬁance of the congregation to which they owed
their representative capacity, had violated their moral and their legal
duties; the parishioners were entirely within their rights in seeking

51

 

THE MELISH CASE

 

to remove them. To prove this contention, Mr. Weissman asked
permission to put all 321 signatories on the stand. He began to ask
them each in turn two questions: Did you sign the statement repu-
diating the action of the Vestry? and: Do you refuse to obey the ]udg-
ment of the bishop? After a dozen had so testiﬁed in the face of severe
cross-examination, the Court, to save time, admitted into the record
that there were 321 parishioners at Holy Trinity who were opposed
to the vestry’s action and ready to refuse to obey the bisl'iop’s Judg-
ment. The Court adjourned the ﬁrst day’s session in the late afternoon.

The annual parish meeting occurred that same evening in the
church. This time there was no hesitancy on the part of the vestrymen
about appearing or campaigning for their re-election. One warden
and three vestrymen had their tenns of oﬁice expire, and there was a
ﬁfth vacancy owing to a resignation of a vestryman for reason of ill
health. “The Committee to Retain the Rector” put up a slate of ﬁve
names of members pledged to work for the retention of the ministers
and the maintenance of the parish policies. Friends of the old vestry-
men put their names in nomination and for the ﬁfth vacancy the name
of a lawyer friendly to their position. After discussion from the ﬁoor,
tellers were elected representing both groups, the ballot box was
opened and the ballots cast. The vote was 234 for the new slate against
83 for the former members of the Vestry. The meeting was concluded
with the passage of a resolution instructing the new Vestry to petition
the bishop to withdraw his Judgment.

These events were reported to the Court the next day as the trial
proceeded. Placed on the stand and subjected to intense cross-examina-
tion, Mr. Melish explained his relationship to the National Council
of American-Soviet Friendship, named many bishops and clergy who
had supported its work, and indicated that three other prominent
Episcopalians had been elected to the current board of directors: Dr.
Mary van Kleeck, former research director of the Russell Sage Foun-
dation; Rev. William B. Spofford, Sr., managing editor of The Witness;
and the Rt. Rev. Arthur W. Moulton, D.D., retired bishop of Utah.
He ﬁled with the Court a lengthy afﬁdavit:

“I am not, and never have been, a Communist or a member of the
Communist Party, and the National Council of American-Soviet
Friendship, of which prior to March 16, 1949, I was chairman, is
not organized to promote, or engaged in promoting, communism. Its
purpose is to promote peace rather than war between Russia and the
United States. My term as Chairman of the National Council of Ameri-
can-Soviet Friendship ended on March 16, 1949. . . .

52

A FIGHTING CONGREGATION

 
 

“In November, 1942, I attended a week-end Congress of American-
Soviet Friendship held at the Hotel New Yorker with the assistance of
several Departments of the Federal Government and bringing together
leaders of many professional and cultural ﬁelds to discuss American-
Soviet relations in the light of the needs of the war effort. As a result
of the thinking of this Congress, in February, 1943, a permanent or-
ganization was formed and incorporated under the laws of the State
of New York—the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship,
Inc. Believing that this work was a service to the national war effort,
and knowing that it had the co-operation of the Federal Government,
I went on the Board of Directors; and on June 12, 1946, consented to
become its chairman. It was not until November 24, 1947 that the At-
torney-General published a list questioning the character of the or-
ganization and indicating that association with it could be used in
connection with the Loyalty Board reviews in determining suitability
for employment in the Federal Service.

“I have continued as chairman through my third term of oﬁice,
which expired March 16, 1949, because I believe the work of the Coun-
cil to be in the interests of world peace, and to be entirely compatible
with my obligations as a Christian minister to do all that lies in my
power to represent One who was called ‘The Prince of Peace.’ The
Council has never advocated the Russian system of government or
economics, nor has it supported a policy of appeasement. It has ex-
pressed the conviction, shared by many prominent and informed Amer-
icans, that world peace depends upon the character of the relations
between the United States and the Soviet Union, and that greater
knowledge on thepart of each country with respect to the other is
indispensable; and that it is wise to explore the things we hold in com-
mon as well as the things about which we differ; and that peaceful
negotiation between the two governments and systems must replace
any reliance upon containment, armaments and division into separate
camps. I consider my association with the Council as legitimate work
for peace entirely in keeping with my profession as a Christian
Minister.

“Nor do I hold that this work, even though it has offended certain
members of the Vestry, has acted to the detriment of the parish of the
Church of the Holy Trinity. The state of the membership, the number
of individuals cooperating in parish committees and functions, the
attendance at services, and the moneys contributed, are on as high
a level as at any time in the period that I have been at Holy Trinity.
Interest in the parish is keen and is growing. It is my measured belief
that there would have been no situation in the parish of the kind
that has developed, had not the Vestry assumed its prejudices to be
representative of the congregation and to have forced an issue which

58

 

THE MELISII CASE

apart from their initiative would have been easily and quietly met.

“I declined to resign my office as Assistant Rector on the request of
the Bishop, because he placed the request on the ground that my
activities as Chairman of the National Council of American-Soviet
Friendship, Inc., and my similar activities were harmful to the Church,
which-, in my opinion, was not true. I thought the Bishop was not
correctly informed as to the facts. I knew that the parish was as pros-
perous numerically, ﬁnancially and in the work it was accomplishing
in the community as it had ever been. I knew that the work of the
Parish was not being neglected but was being carried,on as well as it
had ever been. I felt that the Bishop's request was unreasonable and
not based on an accurate knowledge of the facts, and that he should
not have made it, and with the Rector’si approval, I therefore de-
clined to comply with it. ~

“At the hearing before the Standing Committee it was proved that
the condition of the Parish was as above stated. The Standing Com-
mittee made no ﬁnding—and on the evidence it could make no ﬁnding
-that the work of the Parish had suffered, or that the members of the
congregation or their ﬁnancial support had diminished. It contented
itself with ﬁnding that there was ‘dissension’ in the Parish caused by
my activities, without deﬁning ‘dissension.’ But in every group of
human beings, there is always dissension. Dissension means disagree-
ment, and disagreement is not harmful unless harmful results flow
from it. The Standing Committee did not ﬁnd that any harm had re-
sulted to the Parish. The basis of the Bishop’s alleged judgment is that
a priest in good standing cannot mix with persons having social and

olitical views unacceptable to the majority of the community, and
that a Rector, who does not discharge his Assistant Rector for so
doing, can himself be removed from the Parish, against its will, in
spite of his 45 years of devoted service. I submit that the Bishop’s rea-
soning is unsound and his pretended judgment based on it ineffectual
under the Canons of the Protestant E iscopal Church.”

The Bishop then took the stand an was examined and cross-exam-
ined for nearly two hours. He admitted that the decision to remove the
Melishes had been reached by the standing committee prior to the
hearing at Garden City, which, in so far as he was concerned, had
simply conﬁrmed the opinion of them all that the ministers should
be removed. He also admitted that he had seen neither of the minis-
ters involved, except for the formal visitation of the parish, until the
day before the vestry meeting when he had read to Dr. Melish the
standing committee's resolution. He insisted that in his opinion every
step had been taken in line with strict canonical procedure. There
was no issue of theology or morals involved. There was dissension in
the parish and he took the word of such prominent men as the Vestry-

54

A FIGHTING CONGREGATION

men that it was serious; in his opinion nothing in the testimony before
the standing committee had contradicted their statements. When
asked if other parishes had differences of opinion regarding their min-
isters, he replied there were many. Examined as to why he had not
taken similar action, he answered that no other Vestry had petitioned
him. Asked if he would act if some other vestry did so petition, he
replied that he would be obliged to consider any such petition.

The last witness was Dr. Melish who was treated with great courtesy
by the ]'udge, who referred at length to old civic associations. He was
given opportunity to speak about the history of the parish and the
fine laymen who had supported its policies in the past and whose
generosity had built up the endowment fund to maintain a parish
of this character. He indicated that the kind of ministry that the bishop
approved would be its spiritual death. There was close attention
throughout his testimony and many signs of public sympathy as he
came slowly down from the stand, cane in hand.

]udge Steinbrink the next morning took an hour and ﬁfteen minutes

to deliver the decision. He made no reference to the issues raised by *

the counsel for the defense as to the meaning of the Canon on the
Vestry or the Canon‘ on the Dissolution of the Pastoral Relation. He
simply said that there was dissension in the parish and that the Vestry-
men and the bishop had taken the steps required by the Canon. These
steps he rehearsed in a superﬁcial running account. The special meet-
ing to remove the nine vestrymen had been illegally called, the con-
gregation had acted in a most unseemly manner in attempting to
unseat such honorable and reputable members of the community,
and the Court would make no comment on the congregation’s deﬁance
of the bishop. He therefore declared the rector removed as of April
4th. Then, citing various cases involving the separation of Church and
State—a fundamental principle that must be meticulously sustained
-with curious logic he turned around and slapped a permanent injunc-
tion upon the defendants restraining them from attempting to remove
the nine vestrymen during their elected terms of ofﬁce or interfering
with the exercise of their authority, and enforcing the bishop’s ]udg-
ment. The decision could not have been more sweeping or severe.
Then turning to the parishioners crowding the benches, the Iudge
delivered a pious sermonette on the theme of the Passover and Easter
Resurrection, suggesting to the people of Holy Trinity that now that
the stone was rolled away, they should go forward to a new era.
Coming down from the bench, the ]udge consulted with the lawyers
and then proposed a private consultation in his chambers. With all

55

 

THE MELISH CASE

the parties gathered around the table, he suggested a compromise
proposal: that Mr. Melish should resign, the bishop’s Judgment should
be withdrawn, the court decision should not be entered, the new
vestry should be conﬁrmed in office, and Dr. Melish continue for such
time as he could as rector. Mr. Melish informed the Judge that this
was substantially the proposal that the bishop had made to him prior
to the hearing before the standing committee, and that he and his
father had rejected it on principle. The judge asked that he recon-
sider it, and, turning to the lawyers, urged that it be formulated in
writing. If accepted by the ministers and the Vestry, hi-would under-
take to urge it upon the bishop. After three days of c nstant consul-
tation, this proposal was rejected and Dr. Melish released a public
statement, which said in part:

“I have been Rector for 45 years. During this long period I have
sought to establish certain spiritual and moral values, with the aid of
my many associates. It is these values which have given Holy Trinity
its strength and usefulness.

“After the most careful consideration, involving consultations with
many members of our parish and many of our friends in the Church-
at-large, my son and I, not unmindful of the personal hardships that
may accrue to us, are rejecting this proposal. We believe that it com-
promises the basic principles of democracy within the Church, the
rights of the congregation, the freedom of the pulpit, and freedom
of conscience and speech. These principles must be unswervingly
maintained at all times but especially in such a period as this when so
many are accepting the inevitability of another war. Such a compro-
mise betrays the traditions of this Parish, and, above all, endangers
clergyman‘ everywhere in the exercise of their prophetic and priestly
ministry. Unless these rights are sustained, no minister is free.

“The newly elected members of the Vestry who speak for more
than three-quarters of the voting members of the Parish, as well as
the Committee to Retain the Rector, wholeheartedly concur in this
decision. -

“I have advised my Attorneys to inform Judge Steinbrink that the

proposal is rejected, and that no proposal will be acceptable that in- v

volves the silencing of a Christian minister in the conscientious perfor-
mance of his duties.

“An appeal from the Lower Court’s decision will be taken promptly.
Pending an application for a stay in the Appellate Division, I shall not
preach at Holy Trinity. I have asked the Vestry to see to it that divine
services are maintained in the Church. My family and I will attend
the services as members of the Parish. Together with the other parish-
ioners we shall continue to work and pray for the preservation of the

56'

A FIGHTING CONGBEGATION

 
 

long tradition of the Church of the Holy Trinity and the basic free-

doms of our country.” 1
The appeal of the Lower Court’s decision will be heard in the Octo-
ber term of the Appellate Division, and, if necessary, will be further
appealed to the Court of Appeals in Albany. In the meanwhile the new
Vestry is inviting outside clergy to maintain the Sunday services, its
accredited representatives have been seated in the diocesan conven-
tion, and it is conducting parish business. Since it is the rector who
has been removed by the bishop’s action, Mr. Melish is still technically
in the employ of the parish but is refraining from taking part in the
services until the situation is further clariﬁed. The congregation is

 organizing to maintain the continuity of its parish life. »

The long strain of many months of tension, culminating in the ser-
vices of Holy Week and Easter, the parish meeting on Easter Monday,
the trial and its crushing decision, proved too much for Dr. Melish in
his 74th year. A physical condition that normally could have been
handled at leisure was aggravated by the strain and became acute.
He was taken to the hospital where an operation was required. Now
he is convalescing and regaining his strength. His fortitude during this
bitter experience has further drawn his parishioners around him. As
one of the diocesan clergy put it, “Dr. Melish has experienced his
Good Friday; now he deserves his Easter.”

CHAPTER EIGHT

THE BASIC ISSUES

0 ONE can read this record of the situation at the 1C.hurch of the
N Holy Trinity in Brooklyn without realizing that this is a most
unusual, complex and important case. These two ministers are not
ordinary, routine practitioners of the Christian Faith but conscien-
tious exponents of its fundamental redemptive spirit seeking to reach
out creatively into the pioneering frontiers of contemporaneous life.

It is easy to criticize the Melishes for venturing to inﬂuence national
public opinion from the limited base of a modest parish. But to state
the criticism is to raise a deeper question: Is not this precisely one of
the functions of the ethical witness of the Christian Church?

That they put a strain upon the parochial and diocesan structure
of the institutional Church by the public debate aroused around them
is clear. On the other hand, they have caught the attention of men
and women from Maine to California, from England to Australia,
from Turkey to Russia and to China. They have given expression to
something that multitudes of decent people want the whole world
round—freedom from the fear of another war.

That they were close to something basic to the instincts of humanity
can be gathered from the sense of shock and profound dismay that
their removal has caused. Young men in the seminaries have met to
discuss their case. For the socially-conscious and the prophetically-
inclined it is a sober warning and a serious deterrent from entering
the Christian Ministry. Innumerable queries have poured in, asking
how people can help. On every side is a sense that something sympto-
matic of the times and indicative of the state of health of the Christian
Church, is involved.

For the Episcopal Church the problem is most acute. Four basic
issues have been raised. They are by no means limited to the Episcopal
Church. They have their counterpart in other Communions. Although
they are stated in the way they involve the Episcopal Church, it will
be seen at once that they have meaning also for the wider Christian
fellowship, and for the Synagogue and its freedoms as well.

58

THE BASIC ISSUES
 

l

The Pastoral Relation. In the Melish Case there is a direct violation
of the traditional respect for the pastoral relation between a minister
and his people. This relation is the foundation of traditional Anglican
parish life. It is Anglican practice to consider the pastoral relation on
a par with the marriage bond—a sacred tie that is lifelong in character
and not to be broken for any petty or transient reason but only where
there has been gross inﬁdelity or an actual breakdown in the relation-
ship. Traditionally, this has meant, on the part of the minister, some
grave charge of heresy, immorality, or neglect of duty to a degree that
clearly damages a parish.

At Holy Trinity no such charges have been made. On the witness
stand the bishop afﬁrmed the integrity and the sincerity of both the
ministers, and declared that no question of theology was involved.
The issue was a political issue, and the charge was dissension. No
proof that the parish was in jeopardy was produced. On the contrary,
the evidence of many parishioners, none of it contested in the hearing
or the trial, indicated that the parish is about as well off as it has been
at any time in the past ten years.

Nor is there any question, after the signed statements of the majority
of the parishioners and the voting at two closely watched parish
meetings, that the vast majority of the parishioners wanted, and still
want, to retain both their ministers. The ministers do not desire the
separation. That there was a sharp difference of opinion at Holy
Trinity is undoubted but that there was dissension placing the parish
in jeopardy of survival has not been substantiated. The root of the
vestry’s determination to ask the removal of the ministers, and the real
reason for the standing committee’s recommendation and the bishop’s
action was a political judgment. To make matters worse, that judg-
ment on the part of the diocesan authorities was extreme and in sharp
contrast with the measured and discriminating opinion of the General
Church (as expressed in the Lambeth Resolutions) and conﬂicted
also with the position of such a responsible leader of the Anglican
Communion as the Archbishop of Canterbury who agreed in substance
with the feelings of the diocesan authorities on Long Island but held
that the traditional respect for the pastoral relation and the importance
of preserving freedom of speech took priority.

It would have been far wiser if the vestry and the bishop had
allowed the question of policy which was agitating a section of the
parish to be threshed out at a regular parish meeting and resolved by

59

 

THE MELISH CASE

normal democratic action. Perhaps a few members would have been
disgruntled at the outcome and have withdrawn from the parish.
Perhaps a few vestrymen would have been replaced by other con-
scientious laymen on a straight policy issue. Had the policy of the
ministers been repudiated, they were committed to resign. Such a
procedure would have been normal and would have involved no
fundamental violation of Anglican principles or public scandal. What
has now taken place is of a very different and far more serious char-
acter. An outstanding clergyman in the Episcopal Church has been
forcibly retired against his will and the expressed wish of his people.
A younger man of undoubted sincerity and ability has had his pro-
fessional usefulness to the Church thrown into jeopardy. An entire
congregation that desires to support its diocese and its bishop ﬁnds
itself now in a position where it must ﬁght for its rights against the
intrusion of the episcopal authority into a situation the real nature
of which was incorrectly estimated and the full gravity of which was
certainly not correctly appraised. This action of the bishop strikes
at the fundamental basis of Anglican Church Life-the pastoral
relation.

l

The Status of the Vestry. The General Canons of the Episcopal
Church deﬁne the Vestry as the agent and the representative of the
parish. The language is unambiguous and the meaning clear. The
vesuy meets regularly and acts in behalf of the congregation. It is
answerable to the congregation, and its members are held accountable
for their stewardship in the sense that they must stand periodically for
re-election.

The Canon on the Dissolution of the Pastoral Relation recognizes
that situations may arise in which a disagreement between the parish
and the minister may be of such gravity as to require the arbitration
of the bishop. The Canon speciﬁcally puts the word “parish” ﬁrst.
It is a disagreement between the parish and its minister. The Canon
assumes that the Vestry will act as the agent and representative of the
parish in petitioning for the arbitral judgment of the bishop. There
is nothing in the Canon that gives the vestry the right to act upon
its own initiative in such a situation as existed at Holy Trinity where
it had reason to know that the parish did not wish it so to act. There
is no issue of greater gravity in the life of a parish than the dissolution
of the pastoral relation, especially one involving many years of ser-

60

THE BASIC ISSUES
 

vice. If there is the slightest doubt about the feelings of the parish-
ioners, the vestry has a moral obligation to consult with the parish.
At Holy Trinity, the Vestry assumed that it represented the parish.
It was warned by the ministers that it did not. It made no serious
effort to test its own opinion against that of the parishioners. Indeed,
it proceeded to petition for the separation in the face of signed state-
ments by 70% of the congregation repudiating its proposed action.
The congregation at Holy Trinity had good grounds for removing such
irresponsible vestrymen. More than that, at the Garden City hearing
before the standing committee, the spokesman for the nine vestrymen
went so far as to state that the parish meeting could not pass on an
issue of this importance. Here is a clear case of arrogance of author-
ity by a Vestry.

That the vestry was encouraged by the chancellor of the diocese
to believe that it had this right only makes the matter that much the
more serious. Colonel Dykman asserted in Court that the Vestry is
the corporation in an Episcopal parish and that the only speciﬁc
canonical right belonging to the congregation is the right to elect
the vestry. If the chancellor is conﬁrmed in this outrageous inter-
pretation, one can only agree with Dr. Shipler of The Churchman
that the Episcopal Church ought at once to change its name to the
“Vestriscopal Church." The fact that Colonel Dykman is the legal
adviser to the Presiding Bishop and a member of the National Coun-
cil of the Episcopal Church ought to concern every priest and every
congregation in the entire Church who cares for traditional Anglican
democracy and the rights of the congregation.

Freedom of the Ministry. The most important issue in this case is
the preservation of the freedom of the Christian Ministry to carry
out its priestly and prophetic function in the light of the Christian
conscience without undue Vestry interference, episcopal intervention
or external public pressure. The Melish Case is peculiarly interesting
because it represents a conflation of all three factors.

There were tremendous external pressures bearing down upon
these two ministers. The business community, with its fear of Russia,
its reliance upon government spending on armaments to make jobs
and proﬁts, and its resistance to all manifestations of social change,
does not make it easy for independent voices concerned with construc-
tive criticism and social analysis. The war-mongering groups—the pro-

61

THE MELISH CASE

fessional demagogues, veterans’ organizations, super-patrioteers —
strike at honest voices counseling reason and restraint. Increasing in
the United States are Roman Catholic pressures that may not always
represent the best or the most disinterested public positions and that
may require to be withstood. All these were clearly present in the
case of the Melishes, as was admitted at the Garden City hearing by
one vestryman who said that they had become sick and tired of hear-
ing the criticism of their business and professional associates asking
them why they did nothing about the stands their ministers were tak—
ing. There can be no real security for the clergy in their preaching
or their community activities, if they are subject to removal by a
group of laymen and a bishop on so precarious a charge as that raised
at Holy Trinity—dissension. In any critical period, be it a time of
“cold war” like the present, or a stretch of rapidly increasing unem-
ployment, or some development of a local issue on which men’s minds
sharply divide, outspokenness means difference of opinion. If this is
deﬁned as dissension, all tenure and freedom for the ministry vanishes.

Dissension without some quite speciﬁc charge is a dangerous ground
for the dissolution of the pastoral relation. What parish is there in
which some degree of dissension cannot be claimed to be present?
If that is all that needs to be proven to remove a minister, the clergy
are at the mercy of any vocal group within their parish.

Nothing could be.essentially more dramatic than the exchange that
took place on the floor of the Long Island diocesan convention after
the Melish dissolution when the question of amending the diocesan
Canon came up. Colonel Dykman proposed putting additional teeth
into it, and cited the weakness of the Canon in the Church of Eng-
land where, as he put it, “It is impossible to remove square pegs from
round holes.” He mentioned one notorious case (an obvious refer-
ence to the Dean of Canterbury) and said the American Church
must be relieved of any such canonical restriction. Mr. Melish replied
that, while there was a need for a Canon to deal with misﬁts and
tragic situations, he had received most of his training for the min-
istry in England and knew something of the security and the free-
dom of utterance given to the parish priest by the English Canon.
In a time of profound social change, it is imperative to retain this pro-
tection to the clergy. If the American Canon remains as the diocese
of Long Island has now interpreted it, and as the chancellor would
like to apply it to the General Church, every clergyman had better
stick to his parish knitting and forget that the Christian Faith has
any redemptive business in the modern world.

THE BASIC ISSUES
 

l

The Powers of a Bishop. Bishop DeWolfe and his standing com-
mittee have indicated a political position which the diocesan clergy
must respect or be disciplined. The political position which they have
adopted has serious implications. In a period of “cold war” with
Russia, no criticism of the government is admissible, nor any public
statement or association or action that can be construed as giving aid
and comfort to “the enemy.” The implications of this are frighten-
ing. The essence of totalitarianism is that the government is above
criticism. The instant that the American people yield the right to criti-
cize their government and admit that policies are sacrosanct, totali-
tarianism is on the way to being enshrined.

There is something terrifying when churchmen and leading laymen
in the United States do just the opposite of their heroic Christian
counterparts in Europe. There they fought the fascist manifestations
of the State. Here they are supporting the sanctity of the State in
the supposed interests of the Church. Moreover, Bishop DeWolfe has
joined himself in the action of the vestrymen in the Courts in such a
fashion that he can take advantage of the Courts’ enforcement of his
ecclesiastical judgment. The same religious leader who criticizes other
nations for interfering in the affairs of the Church indirectly turns to
the State to enforce his ecclesiastical decision. Isnot this close to a
violation of the basic principle of the separation of Church and State
on which American Democracy rests?

These are among the considerations that make the action of the
standing committee and the bishop so grave a backward step in the
ﬁght to maintain not only democracy within the parochial life of the
Church but within the national life as well. Bishop DeWolfe has
usurped powers that have never belonged to Anglican bishops. No
Church in democratic America dares permit the bishop of a diocese
to determine the political, social or economic thoughts of its clergy,
nor can it afford to grant him the right to penalize and depose those
Whose opinions and activities are not in accord with his arbitrary
opinions and activities. This is Thought Control. It is what the Euro-
pean knows as Clerical Fascism.

Although this was in practical fact a political “heresy trial,” the
procedure adopted did not afford the defendants the protections

THE MELISH CASE

granted by the Canons in ordinary ecclesiastical trials, where a case
is heard before one’s clerical peers, and there is a right of appeal to
the provincial court. This the Melishes-and the congregation—have
been denied. It is a paradox that had they been accused and_con-
victed of theological heresy, immorality or neglect of duty, they
would have had the right of appeal outside the diocese. Yet in this
matter, which involves the position of the General Church on a basic
issue, and affects the tenure and freedom of all the clergy, they have
been restricted to the limitations of the diocesan authority. It ought
to concern the national Church that some provision be made in the
Canons for the review of a diocesan decision that so gravely concerns
the entire body of the clergy and laity.

These are the basic issues. They are complex but they are funda-
mental. The Episcopal Church must face them if it wishes to retain
the loyalty of congregations that expect to be represented by their
vestries, and to be accorded the type of parish in which they believe;
if it wishes to interest intelligent and socially-alert young men in the
Christian Ministry; and if it wishes to make the slightest indentation
in the ranks of multitudes of working people for whom the Church is
fast becoming an anachronism and an encumbrance.

The Vestry of Holy Trinity, the standing committee and the bishop
of Long Island have done the cause of the Episcopal Church, and the
cause of Christianity, a grave disservice.

It is essential that the General Convention of the Episcopal
Church revise the Canons so as to make this kind of procedure
impossible, and indicate to the Courts that this decision in the
MelishtCase is contrary to the spirit and the intention of the pres-
ent Canon.

It is essential that every effort be made to have the Appellate
Civil‘ Courts reverse Judge Steinbrink’s decision. a

It is essential that public opinion defend the right of the clergy
and‘ the right of all citizens to full freedom of conscientious
speech, thought and action.

PREFACE

AROUND THE WORLD

HE REMOVAL of the Rev. John Howard Melish, D.D., LL.D., as rec-

tor of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn, New ‘York,
after forty-ﬁve years of distinguished service in the Episcopal Church,
has set in motion a chain-reaction that has gone around the world.

“Dr. Melish is ousted,” headlined The Brooklyn Eagle in two-inch
type. The sober New York Times and New York H erald-Tribune gave
the story front-page space, as did newspapers generally across the
nation. In Sydney, Australia, in New Zealand and in the Spanish Press
in Mexico City the news was printed. In England the Manchester
Guardian Weekly devoted two columns to analysis. The editor of a
Paris daily, in New York to cover the United Nations, thought the mat-
ter of sufﬁcient interest to his French readers to warrant his coming
to Brooklyn for an interview.

Hundreds of letters of shocked protest have poured in. A British
clergyman writes, “We are watching the case closely. No bishop in
England has dared to go so far.” A member of Parliament sends
sympathy as does a Regent of Cambridge University. From Rome
comes an inquiry, from Sweden an offer of assistance, and from Istan-
bul in Turkey a typed note declaring the deep concern of the Moham-
medan writer who cannot sign his name “because great persecution in
my country.”

The Soviet Radio has beamed to Eastern Europe and the Far East
“The Case of John Melish,” pointing out that the arrest of certain
churchmen in the new democracies for anti-governmental acts has
been sharply criticized by Americans as an infringement of religious
liberty when in the United States a leading clergyman and his son
are removed from their parish because of the “crime” of pleading
peace and understanding between West and East. That these broad-
casts have been widely heard can be gauged from a letter from an
American in Shanghai. “VVhen I talked with Chinese peasants and
trade unionists and they learned I came from Brooklyn, they asked
me if I knew the Melishes, and I was proud to say I did.”

On his 75th birthday the venerable Rabbi Stephen S. Wise returned
from retirement to preach in his old pulpit in the Free Synagogue he
