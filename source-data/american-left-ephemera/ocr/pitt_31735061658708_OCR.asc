Surely these men are not speaking for the millions of
veterans who in various surveys have indicated that close to
half cannot pay more than $30 monthly rents.

The nation needs from twelve to sixteen million homes
‘ within the next ten years for veterans as well as residents of
slum and near-slum areas. But it is clear that precious little
will be built now that the price and priority controls on
building materials have been scrapped. Materials will go to
big money boys.

“Buildings Up, Rents DoWn”

Make no mistake. The ﬁght against rent boosts is closely
linked to the ﬁght for more housing. They go hand in hand as
long as there aren’t enough houses and rental apartments to go
around. Under such circumstances the landlords call the tune. ‘I
It is signiﬁcant that such shameless conditions exist in many 1
capitalist countries. Bad housing is a product of capitalism. ' 1
Communists everywhere lead -the ﬁght against this social evil.

British Communists have raised the slogan, “Buildings Up, l
Rents Down.” *

Decent housing for all the people cannot be achieved so
long as home building remains a private ‘business for proﬁt
only. This problem -cannot be fully and ﬁnally solved under
capitalism; but federal, state and city government widescale
building at fair rentals, with the aid of subsidies, can provide
housing for millions.

It is possible, however, to win, substantial victories on the
housing front through the organization of labor, tenant, con-
sumer, civic, fraternal, veteran and other groups. '

Organizations on the side of the people opposing rent boosts
are many, including labor, Negro, civic, fraternal, veteran,
women’s, consumers, and others. Millions of Americans, not
hitherto involved in organized popular action, can get mad
enough and do something when faced with the threat of
higher rents and mass evictions. ]ust‘try going through your
house with a petition to keeprents down and you’ll see what

What should tenants do to lick the plans of the get-richer-

I quick boys?

Millions of “grass roots” letters, telegrams, petitions and
postcards should ﬁnd their way to the President’s desk. Such
drives have already been undertaken by many groups. In New
York City, for instance, the newly formed Emergency Com-
mittee on Rent and Housing has initiated a million signature
petition campaign. This group has in it representatives of the
Urban League, Methodist Federation of Social Services, Inde-
pendent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Profes-
sions, League of Women Shoppers, New York Consumer Coun-
cil, National Citizens Political Action Committee, Greater
New York CIO Council and American Veterans Committee.

Tenants are already making headway in block by block
organization. Experience has shown that tenants will stick

‘ together when it comes to ﬁghting for improved house condi-

tions. An excellent example is provided by the Irish, Jewish
and Negro tenants of 14 W. 107th St., Manhattan, who or-
ganized their house 1oo percent and, by withholding rents,
forced their landlord to come acr-oss. The tenants were also
successful in ‘beating three eviction cases in court.

Most tenants will respond to a house organization for im-
proved living conditions. Once they get together to handle
day to day grievances, the problems of increased rents and
other political matters affecting tenants can be introduced
and acted on.

Many community rallies have brought the housing and rent
facts to the people but many more are needed. Leaﬂets, bulle-
tins and neighborhood newspapers are good agitational de-
vices.

The West Side (Manhattan) Mobilization for Rent Control
has done a ﬁne job along these lines. It distributed 50,000
leaﬂets, receiving much mention in the press and radio. The
Mobilization includes dozens of veterans, Jewish, church, child
care, parent, women's, consumers, non-p-artisan and political
(including the Communist Party) organizations. It is prob-
ably one of -the broadest community rent committees func-
tioning anywhere. By no means is it performing miracles.
What it has done can be done in every community.

Speaking at a recent meeting of the Communist Party’s

11

. ,,,..,..L...___....., ~r<A’—'I9ﬂv

 

K“ - .,  \A/\- . .r. C, . .

National Committee, Eugene Dennis, its general secretary,

declared, “The legislative ﬁght for rent controls can succeed
only if it is accompanied with mass organization of tens of
thousands of tenants inthe cities, ‘on a neighborhood and
block basis.” ‘ . .

A hard-hitting tenant group is the United Harlem Tenants
and Consumer Organization working throughout the Negro
slum community where housing violations are rampant and
rents have always been exorbitant. The Organization devotes
much time to ﬁghting for improved housing conditions.

Trade Union Assistance

Trade unionists have much to offer tenant mobilizations.
With their experience in mass activity and organization, they

O are in a position to assist community groups. On their own,,

they should press their city, state and national trade union
oflicials, if they have not already acted, to urge elected repre-
sentatives to ﬁght against rent boosts.

Tenants everywhere should also pull every string to get
national, state and city representatives on record.

Renters cannot afford the luxury of forgetting that small
home owners also belong on their side. Reactionaries have
always tried to pit the renter against the small home owner, try-
ing to keep them on opposite sides of the economic fence. And
t-oo often the small home owner doesn’t see his connection
with tenants, especially if he rents one or two units. But the
end of rent controls will hurt him too. _

Since the depression some states have had laws controlling
home amortization rates. Bank and loan companies are exceed-
ingly irked by this state of affairs and have lobbied to increase
the rates. In the New_York State Legislature last year, bank
spokesmen argued the emergency was over and that rates
should be increased. Over the years the rate of amortization
has been increased from one to two to three percent.

Maintenance of ceilings on amortization rates is part of
the ﬁght against inﬂation. Once rent controls are lifted, the
basis for the continuation of the mortgage moratorium laws

twill be ended. The small home owner will then have to pay

what the banks demand.

. Moreover, uncontrolled rents and interest rates are factors
that help accelerate the economic b00m—and-bust. cycles which
often bring small property owners close to, if not to, the brink
of bankruptcy. 0

In the rent control ﬁght, tenants should make use of the
rights that are legally theirs. These rights should be widely
publicized by consumer and tenant groups. In New York a
tenant may complain to the Health Department when water
and radiators are not hot enough, and to the Department of
Housing and Buildings ‘on the breakdown of services. Of
course, these agencies are not properly staffed and thousands
of complaints may not receive proper or immediate attention.

.However, complaints will get faster action if they are taken up

by tenants’ organizations and committees.
Owners of rental property must be made to recognize that

tenants have collective bargaining rights and -that a house

committee speaks for the entire group, just like a union com-
mittee speaks for the rank and ﬁle. _

At present, New York is the only state with a rent control
law. Effective protection against landlord greed would be 48
such laws in 48 states. But the New York law is far from being
the perfect law Gov. Dewey wants Americans to think it is.
It has many loopholes which tenants and other groups hope
to plug during the 1947 session of the Legislature.

The law must be made foolproof against evictions. In its

present form the section on evictions is vague. Tenants intend
to ask for a moratorium on evictions. They will also demand
that rents be frozen at the original federal “freeze” level. The
present state law recognizes any increases okayed by the federal
government. The law is also weak because it fails to c-over new

. housing.

The enforcement section of -the law is ineffective as it now
stands, allowing only $1,000,000. The federal government
spends $8,000,000 annually to enforce controls.‘Dewey hopes
to get by at one-eighth the cost with the landlords thereby
getting the greatest break.

In addition, the state law doesn't set up an administrative
machinery as now exists under federal curbs. If a tenant has
a complaint against his landlord he has to take him to court.
At present, the tenant complains to the area rent oﬂice and

13

 

 

 

that ofﬁce looks into the matter deciding whether it will take
the landlo-rd to court.

In the ﬁght to keep rents controlled, New York tenants have
a special job. Right in their own town, the so-called Metro-
politan Fair Rent Committee has its headquarters. It is this
committee which has spearheaded the drive to boost rents.
The New York Consumer Committee has often picketed its
ofﬁces at 12 East 41st St., but more work remains to be done
to show up these big proﬁt boys.

Realty groups in New York City are attacking the proposal
to raise the real estate tax 20 points, even though the largest
city in the country has the lowest real estate tax rate of any
city with a population of a million and more.

A 20 point increase in the tax rate would boost the tax $10
on a building assessed at $5,000. On a $200,000 building, the
increased tax would amount to $400.

However, a 15 percent rent increase on an apartment house
assessed at $200,000 with an annual rental income of from
$30,000 to $35,000, would mean a $4,500 to $5,200 rent in-
crease. This sum, say the lan-dlords, is necessary to cover the
$400 additional tax.

Well anybody who can honestly add one a11d one will admit
that this is a lot of bunk. '

New York tenants also have to expose Gov. Dewey who, as
head of the Republican Party, never came to the defense of
price controls. The New York ‘GOP delegation in Washington
has consistently fought all controls. Republicans in Congress,
the spokesmen for Wall Street, have openly or behind closed
doors bitterly opposed bills like the Wagner-Ellender-Taft
measure, and consistently resisted federal rent curbs.

The many tasks listed above are not easy ones and every
step of the way will not be marked by success.

However, the organization of tenants has a double purpose.
First, it ﬁghts to prevent rent increases. If they go through,
then tenants have to conduct struggles by way of picket lines
and rent strikes.

After the last war thousands of tenants withheld increases
and were hauled into court by the landlords. Many times, be-
cause of desperate economic conditions, the courts ruled in
the tenants’ favor. The rent struggles and strikes of those days

14

 

 

 

struck fear in men whose hearts are in their pocketbooks.
These men are just as sensitive today.

The New York Times of the 1920's is full of stories in which
landlords cried “Bolsheviki” because tenants closed ranks.
One landlord went so far as to seek an injunction because he
thought a tenants’ committee was a “House Soviet.”

As early as 1920, soon after its inception, the Communist
Party played an important part in the rent struggles. The city-
wide strike on May 1, 1920, was ascribed to the Communists,
and the Times on May 2 reported, “Communist and IWW
literature was distributed among rent strikers in East New
York, according to Charles Scully of the Bureau of Investiga-
tion of the Department of Justice.”

Of course, all those involved in these showdowns were not
Communists. But Communists are outstanding in leading the
ﬁght for the people. Their activity in behalf of the evicted
during the depression years is well known. They have a rich
experience in how to organize, unite and ﬁght, "and can «be
depended on to -be in the toughest struggles.

With Roosevelt gone, both major parties have shown that
their hearts belong to the Wall Street trusts." The people's
needs are of no concern to them even though Truman may
occasionally give lip-service to the New Deal ideals.

‘ If the people want the peace and security promised them
time and time again, they will have to develop their own
party, led by labor. Unity of all sections of the population-
the middle class, farmers and labor—is needed to ﬁght back
reaction’s offensive. It is their only protection of America's liv-
ing standards. Independent organization of the people can
take place around such bread and butter issues as rent control.

The stakes in the economic battles are great. And they can
be won through house, block, and community organizations.
Among the many picket lines of the near future, there will be

signs reading: ~

“Continue rent controls for three more years without in-
creases.”

“No etlictions in city or country.”

“Build three million new Federal homes a year.”

“No Jim Grow in housing.”

These are the headlines you may be reading in your news-
p-aper from now on unless the public does something about

Even as you read this pamphlet, your landlord may be
signing a pay-up-or-else letter for a rent boost approximating
the news items above. -

Rent control, the last remaining federal wartime control
instituted by the late President Roosevelt, is ﬁghting for its
life. Ranged against it are powerful enemies.

The Nation_al Association of Real Estate Boards and their
state and city afﬁliates won’t stop gunning until rent control
is dead. Landlord groups are organizing furiously among
property, owners for the coming showdown.

The Republican-dominated 80th Congress is out to lift all
curbs as quickly as possible. More and more hardships will
be piled onto renters in the name of unregimented private
enterprise.

The weak Democratic Administration with its policy of
“relaxing controls” will go along with the Republicans unless
the greatest pressure is exerted by the people.

By ending controls, landlords see a chance to make a killing
in postwar proﬁts, especially in view of the desparate housing
shortage. They are crying “me too, me too” as they view
their cronies, the money-grubbers of the National Association

of Manufacturers charge the public as much as they can get
away with.

Consumers are resisting the high price of luxuries, and
even necessities, but on the housing front where their bargain-
ing power is weakest, landlords ﬁgure tenants can be brow-
beaten and intimidated into paying more rent. The theme song
of all landlords these days is “If you don’t like it, get out.”
They know there is no place to go. There is no -substitute for
shelter. Ask the homeless veteran.

Rent ceilings were originally instituted because Roosevelt
understood the nation’s housing distress. He knew that one-
third of a nation was ill-housed and that things would go
from bad to rotten during the war years when all residential
construction stopped. Roosevelt realized that ‘because there
was little or no building during the depression years the
housing pinch would get tighter.

A look at production ﬁgures of housing units for the past
25 years shows why the nation today is up against a dead-end.
Total production of housing units was:

1919 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 405,000

1920 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 247,000

1945 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 200,000

 

It's not hard to see that as -far as housing is concerned the

so—called natural laws of supply and demand do not apply at
all. We have a situation of huge demand and little supply.
If rent controls go and tenants vie for an apartment, it will
go to the highest bidder. Under such circumstances, ruthless
landlords will not be shy to ask the limit.

For the overwhelming majority of the American people
higher rents will mean less milk, bread, meat, butter and
vegetables on the table. It will mean more patches. Skyrocket-
ing prices, the result of smashed price control, have already
reduced the purchasing power of the dollar to less than 60

cents. Increased rents will cut the dollar’s value even further.’

Living costs have not been matched by increased wages which
even today lag at least 20 percent behind prices.

Any change in rent ceilings will cripple the last defense
against inﬂation.

Landlords are clamoring for higher and higher and higher
rent. They are demanding an immediate 15 percent boost,
a request twice denied during the war. It may be granted
partially or in full by Truman who has repeatedly buckled to
Big Business.

GOP Senators Taft (Ohio), Wherry (Wisconsin) and
Wolcott_ (Michigan) have made it clear they are not waiting
for further handouts from Truman. High on the Congres-

- sional calender will be bills to fatten the buzzards. These will

soon be followed by bills demanding removal of all rent
ceilings on old and new structures. Given 15 percent, the
landlords won’t stop until their greed is satisﬁed.

Landlords Stick Together

Some landlords are not even waiting for the say-so of either

the Administration or Congress. Emboldened by a GOP

 

victory for which they plumped, they have already taken the
situation into their own hands by keeping apartments pad-
locked until ceilings are completely lifted. Only the cruelest
indifference to the people’s needs could permit such heart-
lessness. There are still some four million homeless veterans.

In Oklahoma City, landlords have closed 300,000 units in
a strike against OPA. The N'ational Association of Apartment
Owners urged a nationwide strike. Mrs. Frank Morris of
Dallas, president of Landlords Inc., of Texas, set the line by
saying, “We, landlords, have got to stick together.”

And stick together they do through their powerful organiza-

tions and well-oiled lobbies in Washington, state capitals and .
local centers. A

i What is the economic situation of landlords, anyway? To

hear them talk you would think they’re on the rocks. Some -

people touched by the property owners’ plight go so far as to
say, “After all, everybody else made money during the war.
But rentals were frozen. Maybe they deserve a boost.”

As for everybody making money during the war, we won’t:
bother with that in view of the Department of Commerce's
statement that 30 percent of the families in the United States
don't have a penny in the kitchen cookie jar. As for the land-

5

lords,‘ are they entitled to their gimmie-gimmiesP Let's see.

A recent OPA report showed that landlords of large houses
in 1945 increased their net operating income 25 percent above
1939, while landlords of small houses (less than ﬁve units)
increased their take -by 43 percent. Net operating income is
what is left the owner after expenses are paid.

The survey was based on rents in 26 large cities and
disclosed that the landlords’ “general business pr0sperity””“
was the result of an almost 100 percent occupancy combined
with a drop in services and repairs. The nine percent vacancy
loss of 1939 was virtually eliminated in 1945.

Nobody has to be told about the drop in services. During
the war, landlords used the excuse of labor shortage when the
hot water and steam were chilly, the stairs were unclean, the
garbage not collected, the rooms unpainted, the plumbing on
the blink and so on and so on. 5

Even after the war when the excuse about labor shortages
no longer sufﬁces, too many tenants ﬁnd their apartments as
cold as their landlords heart. By a curious twist, the tenants
seem more interested in keeping the house in better condition
than most owners.

The big noise made about increased costs of running a
house, has also been shown to be so much wind. The OPA
study noted that “While wage rates and prices increased con-
siderably during the war, landl6rds’ total expenditures were
kept close to the 1939 amount.” For large apartments, expenses
rose ﬁve percent but for small ones expenses actually
dropped seven percent. .For both large and small dwellings,

rental income rose nine percent, overcoming vacancy loss.

Full-occupancy has proved exceedingly proﬁtable. In pre-
war years it was the custom of the real estate trade to allow
for a vacancy loss of from 15 to 20 percent in estimating a fair
return on investment. No such loss occurs today and none is
expected for years.

Owners of rental property were well taken care of during
the war, the report showed, and should anyone think OPA
might be partial, take a look at what the Department of
Commerce says.

Latest ﬁgures from that department reveal landlords made
a record haul in 1944 amounting to $1,18o,0oo,ooo as ‘com-
pared with $597,0oo,o0o in 1940. Times were even better in
1945 and 1946, according to the experts. *

l A landlord’s greatest expense is the cost of amortization,
interest and taxes. Amortization is the repayment of the mort-
gage while the interest is payment for the loan. These rates
remained the same during the war but as far as taxes are
concerned, in some cities like New York, they actually
dropped. Even though the cost of coal, maintenance and
repairs has risen it still isn’t as high as landlords make out.
The cost of these items never exceeded, even when times were
bad, more than a ﬁfth of what the owners raked in by way of

.rents. With full-up occupancy, the proportion may be less

today. »

Proﬁts in 1946 and 1947 will be well over ‘1939 levels. So
landlords lie when they cry “poverty.”

OPA has never been unkind to property owners despite
what the newspapers say. To petition the agency for a rent
boost a landlord doesn’t have to be a “hardship” case. All he
has to prove is not enough money in the bank. OPA granted
almost a million individual rent increases since controls went
into effect. In September, 1946, alone, it okayed 26,700 raises,
almost twice the number for the previous month.

Tenants have already received a taste of what is in store
for them should rent controls die. During the summer of
1946 OPA “holiday” rents were boosted in all parts of the
country, not protected by state or local laws. Evictions were

' widespread.

Press roundups disclosed that during the period rents sky-

7

rocketed to 300 percent in parts of Michigan, Philadelphia,
Cleveland, Miami, New Jersey and Delaware.

This experience is not without precedent. Some ragged
fate stalks the American people after each war when it seems
housing shortages are more acutely felt, and landlords’ proﬁt-
mania most apparent. Itwas so after the Civil War and after
World War I. No federal controls were in effect after the last
war and when things got so ‘bad because of the shortage, the
labor movement rose up and forced some kind of state con-
trols in New York. The controls left much to be desired as
far as tenants’ needs but they were won only through
repeated demonstrations. ‘

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 1925 rent
level was 65 percent above the pre-war level with the greatest
increase taking place between 1918 (Armistice) and 1921.
"You can imagine what would happen if rents settled down
9 in several years to levels 65 percent above current rents. It
 would be murder.

Headlines of Yesterday 9
Those were the days when tenant unity was the only pro— V 
tection for renters. The following headlines in the New York 

Times indicate what was going on: 9

Firemen will list all empty loft buildings in anticipation of
wholesale evictions. (March 21, 1920.)

City Marshals are making a fortune in eviction cases.
(August 17, 1920.)

Dr. Royal S. Copland charges landlords with threatening
to evict tenants if they do not stop complaining to Health
Department about insufﬁcient heat. (March 26, 1920.)

Report of Mayor's Committee on Rent Proﬁteering says
Negroes are being exploited in Harlem with exorbitant rents
and unsanitarypliving conditions. (Sept. 26, 1920.)

Real Estate Board will send lobby to Albany to oppose city-
built homes. (Sept. 4, 1920.) ,

Riot in Brooklyn when City Marshal tries to move 20
families in Bartlett St. (Oct. 1, 1920.)

Bronx Tenants go on strike and demand 7 percent reduc-
tion in rents." (December 3, 1920.) ‘

Real Estate Board urges unrestricted rent on new homes.
(August 23, 1920.)

The last item sounds like it might have appeared in this

8 .

 

 

morning's paper. Landlords and builders have refused to
engage in widescale construction until rent controls are
eliminated. Only commercial and luxury construction on

which rent curbs are loosest and on which the proﬁt is great- ‘

est, -is now going on.

New home and apartment construction in the United States
have always -been geared to the group which can pay the most.
Rents have been steadily rising over the years. Not so long
ago $10 a room per month was considered high. Then it
became $15, and then $20 and so on. Builders now claim
they can’t build for less than $35 a room. On Madison Avenue
today construction is going on of luxury apartments where a
room costs $800 a year, and the whole six room apartment
rents for $400 a month.

Only after years of use and abuse of better buildings are
the poor and low-income groups permitted to move into the

rundown area.

 

That’s why the realty interests raved against the.‘Roosevelt
low—rent projects which were based on the principle of new
