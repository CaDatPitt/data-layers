stamp act, no sedition and no alien acts, no land tax. Downfall
to the tyrants of America: peace and retirement to the President:
long live the Vice President* and the minority.” David Brown, a
Revolutionary War veteran, pleaded guilty to erecting the liberty
pole. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase, who had lost his seat
in Congress when his war proﬁteering had been disclosed, de-
manded that Brown name his associates. The prisoner refused.

*Thomas Jefferson, a Republican, was Vice President in the Federalist adminis-
tration.

 

 

He was then sentenced to 18 months in jail and a ﬁne of $450.
Unable to pay the ﬁne when his time was served, Brown stayed

in prison until he was pardoned upon J efferson’s accession to the
presidency.

The Spitting Lyon ls Caged

The first man jailed for sedition was a member of Congress,
Matthew Lyon. A scrappy Irishman, Lyon had earned the nick-
name of “the Spitting Lyon of Vermont” and the permanent
hatred of the F ederalists because of a moist retort to a Connecti-
cut congressman who had questioned his valor as a soldier. Since
spitting could not be construed as seditious, at least on the con-
gressional plane, Lyon’s enemies seized upon some critical articles
published in Vermont journals. One charge was that the congress-
man had written this about President Adams:

But when we ﬁnd him borrowing the language of Edmund Burke
and telling the world that although he should succeed in treating with
France, there was to be no dependence placed on any of their en-
gagements, that their religion and morality were at an end, that they
would turn pirates and plunderers, and it would be necessary to be
perpetually armed against them; we wondered that the answer of
both houses had not been an order to send him to a mad house. In-
stead of this the Senate have echoed his speech with more servility
than ever George III experienced from either house of Parliament.

Lyon was tried and convicted in Rutland and immediately
hustled 40 miles to an unheated stinking cell in a crude jail at
Vergennes (the Rutland jail was deemed too good for him).
Lyon’s 4-month term would have been shorter if he had not dis-
suaded his angry supporters from dismembering the jail. But
friends raised double the amount of his ﬁne and reelected him
by a thumping majority before his release. In 1840, Congress
passed a bill indemnifying Lyon’s descendants for his persecution.

Newspapermen were the chosen victims of Secretary of State
Timothy Pickering, whose hatred of Republicans spurred his zeal
as law enforcer. Pickering believed that anyone who criticized
the Sedition Act was open to suspicion as a French sympathizer.
The dour Secretary spent hour after hour reading newspapers in
his quest for sedition. A year after Lyon’s arrest, the federal

9

 

 

marshals collared Anthony Haswell, the respected publisher of
the Vermont Gazette. One of his two offenses was publishing an
advertisement soliciting funds to pay Lyon’s ﬁne. The other was
his reprinting of an article from the Aurora, a ﬁery journal
established in Philadelphia by Benjamin F ranklin’s grandson,
Benjamin Bache. For these crimes Haswell served two months in
jail and paid a ﬁne of $200.

During the ﬁrst four months of the Sedition Act, 21 newspa-
per printers were arrested. It was no coincidence that all of their
journals were Republican. The Federalist newspapers, which were
the large majority, could slander Vice President J eiferson and
other Republicans to the limits of their vocabularies with no fear
of prosecution.

Historians agree that despite the panic over a French invasion,
the Alien and Sedition Acts were mainly designed to cripple the
Republican Party. The Federalists had good cause to be fright-
ened. Irish refugees were swarming into the cities and into the
Republican ranks. They had no love for England and scant‘ re-
spect for the Boston bluebloods.

‘Worst of All Governments’

Nor did the F ederalists expend any sympathy on the working
class. These aristocrats did not believe in democratic government.
Democracy, said Representative Fisher Ames of Massachusetts,
is the “worst of all governments.” A republic should be governed
by those qualiﬁed to govern: the gentlemen of the upper classes
and the upper brackets.

The Alien and Sedition Acts, limited to two years, died in
1800. As soon as President Jefferson was inaugurated he par-
doned all those convicted.

Instead of rescuing the Federalists from political defeat, the
Alien and Sedition laws hastened the extinction of the party of
Adams and Alexander Hamilton. The American people decided
that democracy, with all its defects, was what they wanted. And
the French revolutionaries never did get across the Atlantic. It
was the British who burned the Capitol and the White House in
1814.

Born in Hysteria

Exactly 150 years after the death of the Alien and Sedition
Acts, the McCarran Act was adopted. The climate in the years
1949-1950 was ideal for hysterics. Our monopoly of the atomic
bomb had been ended by the Russians’ ﬁrst explosion. Eleven
leaders of the Communist Party had been sent to prison for con-
spiring to advocate the violent overthrow of the United States
government. Chiang Kai-shek had ﬂed to Formosa from the Chi-
nese Communists. The Korean War had broken out and the UN
forces—mostly U.S. troops—had been pushed back from the
Yalu River by a Chinese army. Dr. Klaus J. E. Fuchs, atomic
scientist who had once worked at Los Alamos, had pleaded guilty
in England to spying for the Soviet Union. Tokyo Rose and Axis
Sally had been sentenced for treason in making wartime broad-
casts. Two Puerto Rican terrorists had tried to shoot President
Truman. And in the United States Senate, Joseph R. McCarthy
had begun his 4-year reign of viliﬁcation by announcing that the
State Department was a den of card-carrying Communists.

Meet the Authors

Although these events were enough to make the timid search
their bedrooms each night, there is little reason to suppose that
the authors of the McCarran Act were moved by fear for the
nation’s safety. The primary authors were Representative (now
Senator) Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota and former Represen-
tative Richard M. Nixon of California. Their House bill was
embodied in an omnibus bill by the late Senator Pat McCarran
of Nevada, proponent of world-wide racial discrimination. Mundt
and Nixon had earned the enmity of labor and consumers by
voting regularly against legislation in the public interest. Mundt
had joined the advisory committee of the National Council for

President Truman vetoed the McCarran Act. He said:

“The application of the registration requirements to so-called
Communist-front organizations can be the greatest danger to free-
dom of speech, press and assembly, since the Alien and Sedition

laws of 1798.

“It opens a Pandora’s box of opportunities for oﬂicial con-
demnation of organizations and individuals for perfectly honest
opinions which happen to be stated also by Communists.”

I3

 

 

 

The law was passed over the President’s veto; Representative
John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts voted with the House majority
to override. A year later proceedings were begun against the
Communist Party. In 1953 the Subversive Activities Control
Board ordered the party to register. Court appeals ﬁnally ended
with the Supreme Court decision in June 1961 upholding the
Board’s order, but the party announced that it would not register.
Indictments, trials and appeals may continue for several years.

Opponents of the McCarran Act warned in 1950 that the Com-

' munist Party would be the ﬁrst victim and labor unions would be

next. When an employer can’t make a comfortable deal with the
negotiators for a clean union, why shouldn’t he try to obliterate
the union label with a red label? As if to prove the prophecy, a
Board examiner in December 1961 recommended that the Board
label the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers
a “Communist-inﬁltrated organization,” which would legally de-
stroy the union’s bargaining rights.

New Pastures for Spies

President Joseph A. Beirne of the American Communications
Workers has pointed out how easy it would be to build a case
against a union: “An anti-labor employer could inﬁltrate the
union with labor spies. They could report chance statements, casu-
al remarks, statements made in jest or anger. The Board would
issue its complaint. The labor spy would only have to say that
a non-oﬂicer dominated the union and that he had made a sub-
versive remar .”

Employers can often be spared the expense of hiring spies."

Every union has its quota of malcontents and neurotics———-members
who were defeated in elections, people who object to union poli-
cies (or to union dues), and a handful who seek security and
preference by courting the boss instead of bargaining with him.
It isn’t hard to ﬁnd a few turncoats who will testify———some in all
sincerity—that the union is Communist-inﬁltrated. _
Interestingly, President John Clark of the Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers has charged that the government’s case is “based
on the evidence of discredited paid informers, an Army deserter
and perjurer, a convicted criminal, and an array of others with

one or another kind of ax to grind. The proceedings before the
Board are the last of a series of government actions instituted
over the last 10 years to harass us. We have already won the
three cases which have gone to the &preme Court and we are
conﬁdent that this case will have the same result.”

Justice Black Dissents

The fate of the McCarran Act was only partly decided by the
Supreme Court in June 1961. The Court ruled merely that the
Subversive Activities Control Board had properly ordered the
Communist Party to register, and that the order was constitutional.

It is the Court’s policy to postpone crossing any constitutional
bridges until it comes to them. Hence the Court did not decide
whether the Communists could be ﬁned and jailed if they refused
to register. Perhaps, the Court majority reasoned, the Commu-
nists would register, and then a decision would not be needed.

Nor did the Court act on the constitutionality of the labeling,
passport and job provisions of the law. Those questions could
wait until someone was actually prosecuted. Finally the Court did
not rule on the “Communist-front” and “Communist-inﬁltrated”
sections of the law. It was concerned only with the case of a
“Communist-action” organization: the Communist Party.

The dissenting opinions of the four justices are stirringly
written. These excerpts are from Justice Hugo Black:

I do not believe that it can be too often repeated that the freedoms
of speech, press, petition and assembly guaranteed by the First Amend-
ment must be accorded to the ideas we hate or sooner or later they
will be denied to the ideas we cherish. The ﬁrst banning of an associ-
ation because it advocates hated ideas—whether that association be

called a political party or not-—marks a fateful moment in the history

of a free country. That moment seems to have arrived for this country.
‘I’ C‘ I’

This whole Act, with its pains and penalties, embarks this country,
for the ﬁrst time, on the dangerous adventure of outlawing groups
that preach doctrines nearly all Americans detest. When the practice
of outlawing parties and various public groups begins, no one can
say where it will end. In most countries such a practice once begun
ends with a one-party government. There is something of tragic irony
in the fact that this Act, expressly designed to protect this Nation
from becoming a “totalitarian dictatorship” with “a single political

party,” has adopted to achieve its laudable purpose the policy of out-
lawing a party—a policy indispensable to totalitarian dictatorship.
‘I’ I C’
. . . Now, when this country is trying to spread the high ideals of
democracy all over the world———ideals that are revolutionary in many
countries——seems to be a particularly inappropriate time to stiﬂe
First Amendment freedoms in this country. The same arguments that
are used to justify the outlawry of Communist ideas here could be
used to justify an outlawry of the ideas of democracy in other nations.
5 Q ‘I’

I believe with the Framers of the First Amendment that the inter-
nal security of a nation like ours does not and cannot be made to
depend upon the use of force by Government to make all the beliefs
and opinions of the people ﬁt into a common mold on any single
subject. Such enforced conformity of thought would tend only to
deprive our people of the bold spirit of adventure and progress which
has brought this Nation to its present greatness.

I ‘I’ §
. . . This widespread program for punishing ideas on the ground
that they might impair the internal security of the Nation not only
sadly fails to protect that security but also diverts our energies and
thoughts from the many far more important problems that face us
as a Nation in this troubled world.

The Frightened Giant

Dr. Royal W. France, the constitutional’ lawyer, has called
the McCarran Act “perhaps the most noxious assault on the
freedom of Americans to think and speak ever enacted.” He
points out: “In all the other great democracies the party functions
freely within the democratic process. We play the part of the
frightened giant.”

Joe McCarthy has gone from the American scene, but his
monstrous legacy of fright and suspicion is still unspent. We are
too often cowed into clinging to our small comforts, never demand-
ing that democracy be shared by all, never asserting our sover-

eignty over our agents in Washington. Few of us today would cry
aloud with Walt Whitman:

I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,
By God.’ I will accept nothing which all cannot have their
counterpart of on the same terms.

FOREWORD

As the United States Government proceeds to enforce the Mc-
Carran Internal Security Act of 1950-—the worst -piece of anti-freedom
legislation in the history of our repubIic—-the civil liberties crisis has
reached a new climax. To provide the basic information about this
law and to awaken Americans to its dangers, the Emergency Civil
Liberties Committee presents this pamphlet“-by Alexander L. Crosby,
pamphlet writer and former newspaperman.

I think that Mr. Crosby has given us here a most readable and
dramatic account of how the McCarran Act works and why it negates
the fundamental First Amendment guarantees in the Bill of Rights.
This statute was born in hysteria, says Mr Crosby. I would add that
the Govemment’s insistence on enforcing it shows that the hysteria

. is still with us. Fanatical and unreasoning fear of Communists and

communism has done a thousand times more to undermine American
democracy than anything the Communists themselves have done.
The pamphlet rightly calls for the heaviest possible pressure on
Congress to repeal the McCarran Act. Until repeal is achieved, we
urge President Kennedy to pardon anyone convicted under this re-

  ’ pressive legislation, and thus to follow Thomas J eﬁerson’s example

in reference to the Alien and _Se_dition Laws. It would be heartening
if the President went further and directed the Department of Justice
to cease enforcement of the McCarran Act;

The Road to Repeal

The McCarran Act was originally opposed and condemned
by hundreds of labor unions, church groups, civic organizations,
minority groups, public oﬂicials and newspapers. President George
Meany of the AFL-CIO declared that the law “eliminates and
destroys unions.” The Wall Street Journal said it was “a piece
of political skulduggery.” It was hard to ﬁnd a kind word for
the law from any respected source in the nation.

Why the Act Has Survived

How does it happen that the act has survived to begin at last
its un-American activities? Five main reasons may be cited:

First, many people expected or hoped that the Supreme Court
would consign the law to the unconstitutional garbage can.

Second, it’s always tougher to organize a second ﬁght after the
first battle has been lost.

Third, no national administration since Truman has recognized
the McCarran Act’s challenge to the democratic process.

Fourth, millions of citizens have already been scared into the
habit of conforming. They are afraid that if they sign a petition
or write to a newspaper or congressman some snooper will eventu-
ally come around to ask, “Are you now or were you ever . . .17”

Fifth, the Communist Party is hardly more popular than Los
Angeles smog. Who will put himself in the position of seeming
to defend the Communist Party, even when he is actually defend-
ing his own freedom? It takes more than clear thinking to do
this. It takes courage.

When the McCarran Act was upheld in 1954 by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, Editor I. F. Stone commented on the silence
among editorial writers and commentators who had applauded
Truman’s veto four years earlier. “These editors and writers have
not so soon forgotten,” he wrote. “They falter because this ﬁrst

“What are you doing out there?”

registration order is against the Communist Party, and one just
does not defend Communists any more. . . .

“It would be a happy event for timorous editors if the Sub-
versive Activities Control Board would rally all the better elements
of the country against it by issuing its first registration order
against—let us say—the board of directors of the Chase National
Bank. Unfortunately that is not how the foundations of freedom
are ﬁrst rendered shaky. The principle that the government has a
right to make you account for your political views is more easily
established by starting with some untouchable extremist fringe
the respectables shudder to defend. . . . The registration order
against the Communist Party is the keystone of the whole McCar-
ran Act structure. Once that order has been upheld, the damage
has been done.”

The damage can still be undone. But the undoing will demand
some of the spirit shown by Senator Stevens T. Mason of Vir-
ginia, who rode horseback through the 1798 winter to Vermont,
carrying $1,000 in gold to pay the ﬁne of Matthew Lyon.

Obviously the McCarran Act won’t be repealed on the initia-
tive of Congress. Every congressman’s nightmare is a resolution
from the local American Legion or an editorial in the local paper
condemning him for being soft on Communism.

The opportunity to repeal the McCarran Act lies with a few
million citizens who could speak but have not. The best places to
start talking are in your own house and when you have lunch with
friends or co-members of the organizations you belong to. Make
certain that the talk does not vanish in the air of futility. Get
your opinion on paper.

It is well known in the television business that six letters of
protest against any show have the effect of a major earthquake.
Bells ring, briefcases are grabbed and taxicabs summoned for
an emergency conference of sponsor, producer, advertising agency
and psychiatric staff.

Your Voice Will Count

Fortunately Capitol Hill is not the same as Madison Avenue,

but any legislator who becomes deaf to the voices from home will
soon lose his seat as well as his hearing. And so the congressmen
take careful note of serious letters from local ministers, lawyers,
businessmen, teachers, mechanics and honest voters in general.

A resolution from the local branch of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People or the United Steel-
workers of America or the National Council of Jewish Women
or any other inﬂuential organization carries weight. The effort
of composing a letter or drafting a resolution can bring a return

far beyond the greatest hopes of the writers. Communications on .

the McCarran Act will get extra attention because most congress-
men have received very few in recent years.

The same holds true of newspapers. Can you remember when
you last saw a letter on the McCarran Act in your local paper?
If, over a few weeks or months, you and other First Amendment-
loving citizens ﬁlled the void, you would make it easier to get
resolutions adopted and you might be rewarded with an editorial.
Don’t worry if the editorial is hostile—that will provide more op-
portunities for writing. Controversy is the lifeblood of democracy,
and controversy will get the McCarran Act repealed.

ONE OBJECTIVE

an Associate of the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee

for $5 a year. You will receive the bulletin, Rights, and
other publications. You will discover vital information emitted
by the press and radio. New Associates will get David Wes1ey’s
startling pamphlet, Hate Groups and the Un-American Activities
Committee. This is the pamphlet of which Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
wrote, “I think it will be well for every American to read this
document.”

The Emergency Civil Liberties Committee was formed in
1951 for one objective: To reestablish the freedoms guaranteed
by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The Committee does
not wish to supplant other groups ﬁghting for the Bill of Rights.
Every group, every dedicated citizen, is needed in this crisis. Nor
is the Committee concerned with foreign policy or economic sys-
tems. The struggle to save our liberties is enough for any or-
ganization.

In its ﬁrst 10 years the Committee has raised and spent
$390,000 to defend the Bill of Rights. With its limited budget,
it obviously has not been possible for the Committee to be a
general defense organization. Instead the policy has been to take
test cases of unusual importance, so that a victory in one case
becomes a victory for the whole country. For example, when the
Supreme Court decided the cases of Rockwell Kent and Dr. Walter
Briehl, which were supported by the ECLC, the right of all people
to travel was favorably affected. Similarly, when the Supreme
Court held in the case of Abramowitz vs. Brucker that the Army
must grant honorable discharge for honorable service, all who
served in our armed forces were given protection against abuses
which the Army practiced before ECLC took the Abramowitz
case to the Supreme Court.

The Committee has informed hundreds of thousands of citi-
zens through meetings and publications. Although the outlook for

How the y   »
McCarran Act Works

Since June 5, 1961, it has been dangerous to be a thinking,
American. ‘

On that day the United States Supreme Court upheld the
McCarran Internal Security Act requirement that the Commu-
nist Party register as the agent of a foreign power. The decision
was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice Warren and ustices Black, Bren-
nan and Douglas dissenting.

The FBI says no more than one person out of 18,000 in the
United States is a Communist. Then why should the other
17,999 worry? There are good reasons for worry. The McCarran
Act robs each citizen of freedoms we have cherished since
the Revo1ution—freedoms that were written into the Constitution
as the Bill of Rights. The McCarran Act limits your right to
speak freely and to organize for the betterment of American life.
You can no longer count on the protection guaranteed by the First
Amendment: ~ -

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridg-
ing the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the
people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government
for a redress of grievances.

The nominal purpose of the McCarran Act is to cripple the
Communist Party and any organization which the Subversive
Activities Control Board calls “Communist-front” or “Commu-

S nist-inﬁltrated.” But consider how the law will operate. Suppose

you belong to a civic organization, a church group, a labor "union
or a student organization interested in domestic and world affairs.
If your organization limits its free speech to such questions as the

I

 

 

 

 

licensing of stray cats and the installation of parking meters, you
can sleep well. The federal government will leave you alone.

But suppose your group speaks out on some of the vital is-
sues of today. Suppose you advocate equal rights for Negroes,
more low-rent housing, national health insurance, a halt to
nuclear tests and positive action for peace. Then you are in
danger because, whether or not you knew it, the Communist Party
advocates the same things.

The fact that you don’t have a single Communist or Commu-
nist sympathizer in your organization won’t save you. One crucial
test set up by the McCarran Act for penalizing any organization
is “the extent to which the positions taken or advanced by it from
time to time on matters of policy do not deviate from those of
any Communist-action organization.”

Innocence Is No Excuse

In other words, if your positions are like those of the Com-
munists, you are inviting trouble. It won’t make any difference
if your organization has taken its stand independently, after
careful discussion of the facts. The ﬁnger will be pointed at you,
and the consequences can be serious.

The Attorney General of the United States starts the machin-
ery of the McCarran Act. He reports to the Subversive Activities
Control Board that he believes a certain group is either a Com-
munist-action organization, a Communist-front organization or a
Communist-Inﬁltrated organization.

The Board then calls a hearing. The costly burden of proving
itself innocent falls upon the suspected organization. Innocence
will be hard to establish if some major policies happen to re-
semble those of the Communist Party. But even if the organization
wins its case, the damage will be serious if not fatal. Newspaper
and radio reports of the Attorney General’s accusations will alarm
the members. Many will resign, depriving the organization of sup-
port when it is most needed. Some of those who don’t quit will
be told by their employers that their continued presence on the
payroll is embarrassing. The price of honest opinions will be
unemployment.

If the Board ﬁnds against the organization, and if the federal

From The Nation.

courts uphold the Board, the decision will be little short of a death
sentence. The organization must then register with the Attorney
General as a Communist group. It must list all of its current oili-
cers and any others of the preceding year. It must report where
it got all of its funds during the preceding 12 months and how
the money was spent. It must ﬁle annual reports. It must list any
mimeograph machines or printing presses in its possession. And
it must label anything sent through the mails, “Disseminated by
_________, a Communist organization.” If it goes on radio
or television, the broadcast must be introduced with these words:
“The following program is sponsored by_____________, a Com-
munist organization.”

All the required information will be open to public inspec-
tion at the Department of Justice. It will be a gold mine for
snoopers and for those with personal axes to grind. Any warm-
hearted soul who once gave $10 to support a good cause sponsored
by the wrong organization might forfeit his right to a government
job and endanger his private employment.

The penalties for failing to register are extreme. For each day
of delay, the McCarran Act prescribes a ﬁne up to $10,000 or a

PARTIAL CHECKLIST OF SUBVERSIVE

The following quotations are from statements by the Com-
munist Party of the United States on several domestic and in-
ternational issues. Any organization that takes similar stands could
be accused by the Attorney General of being a Communist-front
or Communist-inﬁltrated group, with registration under the Me-
Carran Act required.

PEACE “We regard peace as the paramount issue in
American political life. We dedicate ourselves
fully to this task. We claim no monopoly and
seek no narrow partisan advantage in this issue
of issues.”

EQUAL RIGHTS “We believe that the struggle for the full social,
political and economic equality of the Negro
people is the major issue of democracy within
our country today. It is the test by which peoples
all over the world judge America’s pronounce-
ments on democracy.”

FARMERS “For the farmers, a larger share of the national
income, aid to meet debts, relief from the cost-
price squeeze and from what is called ‘vertical
integration.’ ”

prison term up to ﬁve years——or both. A delay of two weeks could
mean a ﬁne of $140,000 and 70 years in prison for each oﬂicer
of the organization.

But the penalties don’t stop with ﬁnes and prison terms. Any
member of a group called “Communist-action” by the Subversive
Activities Control Board is prohibited from holding a federal
job, working in a defense plant or working for a labor union.

If a member of a Communist-action or Communist-front or-
ganization is an alien, he may be deported. If he is a naturalized
citizen, he may be denaturalized. It is a criminal offense for him
to apply for a passport or try to use one he has. He retains the
right to go hungry in a country that won’t let him leave.

OPINIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

LABOR “The Communist Party endorses and ﬁghts as
members of the -working class for all major eco-
nomic demands of the unions today—more wages,
a shorter work week, relief from speedup, safer
and more sanitary conditions of work, adequate
unemployment and pension beneﬁts, protection
against blacklist. . . .”

CONSUMERS

“For the consumer, which means all of us, the
Communist Party advocates price and rent con-
trol, reduction of taxes.”

YOUTH “For the youth—better job opportunities, a mini-
mum wage scale, protection from hazardous oc-
cupations and better educational facilities.”

HOUSING From platform of New York State Communist
Party, 1961: “Housing facilities for those living
in slum clearance areas; annual construction of
50,000 low-rent units and 20,000 middle-income
apartments at $21-$25 a room; mortgage loans
at low interest rates and without restrictions as
to race, creed or political beliefs.”

Traditionally, Americans have been free in time of peace to
travel where they wish. But when the McCarran Act was adopted,
the State Department began to refuse passports to citizens sus-
pected of unpopular political views. The Emergency Civil Liber-
ties Committee carried two cases to the Supreme Court, which in
1957 found no legal justification for denying passports. Now,
with its 1961 decision upholding the McCarran Act, the Supreme
Court has cleared the way for another ban. It is a crime for any
State Department employee to issue a passport to a member of a
Communist-action or Communist-front organization.

But would the Attorney General ever ﬁle complaints against
non-Communist organizations simply because they took positions

 

 

 

paralleling some of the Communist policies? The answer is that
the McCarran Act gives him this power and there would always
be powerful pressures for using it. Whenever your organization
takes a stand on a controversial issue, those who disagree with
you are irritated. If you urge equal rights for Negroes, the white
supremacists are sore. If you demand more low-rent housing, the
real estate lobby is antagonized. If you call for national health
insurance, the organized doctors are indignant. If you advocate
peace and disarmament, you invite retaliation from the powerful
industrial-military complex that thrives on war preparations.

These conservative groups and legislators may be counted
upon to defend their interests with every tool available. The
McCarran Act is perfectly designed for their purpose. When a
complaint is ﬁled by the Attorney General, the organization be-
comes pictured in the public mind as Communist. It isn’t neces-
sary to prove that the accusation is justiﬁed.

Truth Becomes lnconsequential

There are thousands of non-Communist organizations in the
United States that have taken stands paralleling those of the
Communist Party. Labor unions and church groups have been
particularly active. Conspicuous examples are the non-Commu-
nist groups that have supported the Freedom Rides and other
actions for integration. Not surprisingly, these crusaders for con-
stitutional rights have been called Communistic by racist ofﬁcials.

What is to stop the Attorney General from making a com-
plaint when evidence of parallel positions is given to him? The
Attorney General is sworn to uphold the laws of the United States,
and the McCarran Act is one of them.

There is only one sure way to avoid the penalties of the Me-
Carran Act. Each citizen must learn all the policies of the Com-
munist Party and the world Communist movement. Then he must
never, never open his mouth to agree with a single one—even if
he happens to believe in it.

Yet to ask an American not to speak his mind is to ask the
impossible. The ultimate refuge, therefore, is to stop thinking.
And this may be precisely what the McCarran Act was intended
to accomplish.

A Preview in 1798

From 1798 to 1800 the United States had a preview of the
McCarran Act. This was the life span of the Alien and Sedition
Acts, forced through Congress by the Federalist Party when John
Adams was President.

The parallels are striking. Then as now, the excuse was that
the nation was threatened by a revolutionary power bent on con-
quering the world. Then as now, it was charged that the agents
of this foreign power were getting their orders and their money
from abroad. Representative Harrison Gray Otis pictured in the
House “a crowd of spies and inﬂammatory agents which over-
spread the country like the locusts of Egypt.”

There was one big difference in 1798. The foreign power was
France, where the popular revolution had been a death sentence
for countless aristocrats. France and England were locked in
battle. The American Federalists, who looked upon France as the
Wellspring of evil, predicted the United States would be the
next objective of Napoleon’s armies. Unless subversion could be
stamped out, this nation’s cities and female population would be
ransacked by the merciless barbarians.

$100 for a Bum Joke

The sedition law was intended to silence all criticism of the
federal government. When a salute for President Adams was
ﬁred in New Jersey, a tipsy Republican (political ancestor of to-
day’s Democrat) remarked to a fellow bibber that he didn’t care
if the cannon ball were “ﬁred thro’ his arse.” The comment was
overheard by the tavern keeper. The Republican was arrested and
given a sobering ﬁne of $100 for his unkind remark about the
President.

There was nothing funny about other prosecutions. In Ded-
ham, Massachusetts, a liberty pole was raised with this sign: “No
