  

Mustn’t the United States catch up or get
ahead of the Soviet Union in the arms
race before negotiating any further on
disarmament ?

The Soviet Union is not going to stand still
while we ‘catch up. Moreover, rapid techno-
logical advances make exact military equality
at any given moment a mirage. If we get
clearly ahead, the Soviet Union will have the
same doubts that we have now about nego-
tiating. Meanwhile, explosive tensions mount.

There is no more likelihood the arms race
will stop when missiles have been perfected
than when the atomic, and then the hydrogen
bomb were developed. The race for anti-missile-
missiles, huge underground shelters or chemical
and bacteriological weapons may follow. More
and more countries will become able to make
nuclear weapons, countries which may be gov-
erned by extreme nationalists, dictators or ad-
venturers. Therefore, delaying serious disarma-
ment negotiations is futile and may be fatal.

But can we expect the Soviet Union, from
its present position of strength, to nego-
tiate any agreement that would be fair
to us?

It is certainly hard for any nation to forego
taking advantage of its relative strength—wit-
ness years of Soviet Union attempts to gain
military and propaganda advantages in the UN
disarmament negotiations. However, there are
now enormous pressures for agreement:

0 Each of the great power blocs knows that the
other already has the power to annihilate it.

0 Both sides recognize great dangers to them-'
selves if other nations develop H—bombs.

0 Even our allies are questioning whether
mutual defense pacts may not be suicide pacts.

0 Both sides say that they realize the (utter
impracticability of war with present weapons
and the folly of impoverishing themselves for
more and more weapons which have no sane
use.

0 Vast neutral areas of the world demand some
assurance of peace.

If both major power blocs are really ready to
reject an endless future of mutual terror, both
may be ready, for the ﬁrst time, to negotiate for
disarmament seriously. Then surely the ingeni-
ous human mind that can split the atom and
explore outer space can also devise a fair and
reasonable procedure for disarmament.

K How Could World Disarmament Work?

 
   

Obviously world disarmament requires far-
reaching changes in relations between nations
and inside nations. It must therefore be achieved
in stages—all the more reason for beginning
now.

One of the ﬁrst steps is to reach agreement
on the ultimate goal. In 1959, the 82 nations
in the UN unanimously approved a resolution
calling for “general and complete disarma-
ment.” But it is unclear whether the world’s
leaders fully understand the implications of such
a goal and are ready to commit themselves to it
wholeheartedly.

There are several areas in which immediate
progress toward world disarmament is possible.

1. Discontinue nuclear weapons tests. Real
progress has been made toward a treaty to end
such tests. V If such a treaty is signed, inspec-
tion stations manned by East-West staffs would
be set up in the Soviet Union, the United States
and elsewhere. This would be a fundamental
breakthrough toward world peace. It would
pave the way for more far-reaching steps toward
general disarmament.

A test ban would be relatively easy to inspect
and would halt dangers to human health and
heredity from fallout. Cessation of tests would
not do away with nuclear weapons now in being,
but it would prevent the _testing of still more
destructive weapons. A test ban would prevent
the many countries now on the eve of pro-
ducing nuclear weapons from polluting the air
by testing them and from complicating the
international situation by becoming nuclear
powers.

2. Prevent surprise attack. If nations
could be assured other nations were not plan-
ning aggressive moves against them, tensions
would be eased. International inspectors could
be stationed at key road, rail and airport and
harbor areas. Notiﬁcation could be given of
missile ﬁrings.

Agreement should be reached soon to place
all further development of missiles, space plat-
forms, reconnaissance satellites and similar de-
vices under UN control. Outer space should
be used for peaceful purposes only.

3. Stop production ofsnuclear weapons.
The United States and Russia have already

stockpiled enough nuclear weapons to destroy,

each other many times over. Production of
ﬁssionable material for weapons purposes should
be cut off and diverted to peaceful purposes.

4. Disengage forces in Central Europe.

Withdrawal of Soviet. and U.S. military forces

and military aid from these areas‘ would ‘reduce
explosive tensions which could start World War
III. Many thoughtful Americans have recom-
mended this course. The Soviet Union has
offered tonegotiate such an agreement.

Pilot demilitarization projects in tension areas,
with the necessary inspection, would give the
UN experience in genuine police action and
show possible procedures for inspecting and en-
forcing eventual world disarmament.

* >l< *

Steps toward World disarmament must be
accompanied by efforts to bring about mutual
conﬁdence between nations. An atmosphere
must be created in which friendly intercourse
between governments will displace the fear and
suspicion that now lead to arms competition.
Political disputes in Europe, the Middle East
and the Formosa Straits must be solved. Greatly
increased economic assistance should be given
to newly developing nations. Brain power and
money presently devoted to creating weapons
of mass destruction must be channeled into

efforts aimed at abolishing war and improving

life for all mankind.

But Is Disarmament Really Safe?

Not absolutely safe—We must make a choice
between a calculated risk and an incalculable
risk. We run enormous risks every day the
arms race continues.

All current disarmament proposals are based
on as adequate an inspection system as man can
devise. This seems inﬁnitely safer than man’s
present reliance on nothing but the good faith
of the leaders both of his own country and of his
potential enemies to preserve him through the
night. ~

Consider how the major powers tend to be-
come involved in every small War. Consider
how the United States is preparing to ﬁght
“limited” nuclear wars with “small” nuclear
weapons. Consider the temptation of the major
powers to forestall each other with a knockout
blow.‘ Consider that a shower of meteorites
might force a split second decision as to whether
an attack had started that required retaliatory
measures. Consider that one bomber or one
missile can now carry an H-bomb with destruc-
tive power greater than all the bombs dropped
by all sides during all of World War II.

Faced with this extreme peril, shouldn’t we
embark on a crash program for World disarma-
ment and the development of world law?
Shouldn’t We explore all alternatives to nuclear
war, including non-violent resistance? Increas-
ingly, thoughtful people are saying that non-

4

 

  

cooperation and non-violent resistance have
become the only practical recourse against
aggression, since modern war means mutual
annihilation no matter who is the aggressor, or
who is the victim, or who “wins.”

How Could We Deal with International
Disputes in a Disarmed World?

The pattern for dealing with disputes among
human beings was fairly satisfactorily worked
out long ago. Law, with police and courts for
its enforcement, is the most practicable pattern
yet devised. At the international level, as at
every other level, the development of United
Nations law—making and law-enforcing machin-
ery will have to accompany the abolition of vio-
lence as the accepted method of settling
disputes.

Think for a moment how a world of law and
order would increase our Security; What it would
mean for small nations now being manipulated
by the big powers.

But how, if we don’t have armaments,
can we thwart the Communists’ intention
to control the whole world?

Remember that world disarmament would
deprive. the Soviet Union of means for military
aggression’ in the same proportion as it would
deprive the United States of military means for
resistance.

As a matter of fact, we haVen’t been very suc-
cessful in thwarting the spread of Communism
during the years of U.S. military superiority.
Since World War II Communism has spread to
over a quarter of the world’s population, pri-
marily by political and economic‘ means.

This is likely to be the way it will continue
to spread and this can’t be combatted with arma-
ments. In fact, the more our money and atten-
tion are concentrated on arms, the less likely
we are to stop the spread of totalitarianism in
the only way it can be stopped—namely, by
helping the world’s people to raise their living
standards and by letting democracy sell itself
to them on its merits.

The merits of democracy are apparent in a
peaceful and prospering world. In a fearful
and hungry world, totalitarianism ﬂourishes.

How About My Chances of Making a Liv-

ing, if Disarmament Starts?

There is no sensible reason why it should.

We now spend more than $45 billion a year for.

arms. This money could surely be, more con-
structively used. Large public expenditures‘ are
needed for more schools, roads, hospitals, etc.,
for foreign aid to raise world living standards;
they could help prevent unemployment. Gradual

, disarmament would permit some tax reductions

which put moreimoney into consumers’ pockets.
Government assistance to industries, .yv_orke,rs

and communities hard hit by the loss of defense f 
contracts could prevent undue hardship. We

must demand that government agencies be
created to prepare carefully researched dis-
armament plans and an orderly transition from
defense work to civilian work. -

We Must Stop Juggling Words

We must face our common danger and put
our best insights to work on our best hope for

survival—disarmament, the creation of world V

law and the abolition ofewar.

International immorality has brought us to a
desperate plight. In a world where we have all
become the closest of neighbors, we have failed
to apply to international relations the principles
of law and order and the basic decencies which
we know are essential at all other levels of
society. ' -

There is no easy path to sanity and secu-
rity. We can be saved only by the faith that
all men are brothers of the same spiritual

_essence, intended by God to live together

without violence——and capable of doing so by
the exercise of their God-given wills. In this
faith we can begin to see, accept, and take
first steps out of the bottomless pit into which
we are sliding. ‘
