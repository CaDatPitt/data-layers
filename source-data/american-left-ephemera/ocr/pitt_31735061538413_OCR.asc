THE TRUTH ABOUT
COMMUNISM !

 

The Statement of Eugene Dennis that the Un-American
Committee Was Afraid to Hear 

 

For nearly ten years now, the Dies-Rankin-Thomas
”Un-American” Committee has been polluting the
stream of American public life with its smear cam-
paigns, hysterical witch-hunts, attacks upon any form
of liberal or progressive thought, and upon democracy
itself.

During the war against the fascist axis, Congress-
man Dies, the first chairman of this Committee, was
the man most quoted on the Berlin radio. Henry
Wallace characterized him as more useful to the
nazis than a division of nazi troops on American
soil. Throughout its career, this committee has given
protection to foreign and home-grown fascists, while
attacking every form of opposition to fascism as
”Communism,” ”foreign ideology,” ”orders from

Moscow,” etc.

In the state of California, the Tenney Committee
has been following this model and has made itself
both hated and ridiculous by its attacks upon every
type of thought and political activity in the state of
California, as ”Communism.” The climax of this hys-
teria of the Rankin-Thomas Committee, and the Ten-
ney Committee has now been reached with their
proposals to nullify the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights by outlawing the Communist Party, or depriv-
ing Communists of their constitutional rights, or pro-
secuting them on faked-up charges of ”conspiracy,”
as ”foreign agents” etc. if

. At this time, when it is more than ever clear that
the real targets of this red-baiting attack are T. the
Labor movement; 2. the supporters of the late Presi-
dent Roosevelt’s policies of the Four Freedoms, Big
Three unity and the Economic Bill of Rights; and 3.
our American democracy itself, Councilman Daven-
port, in the hope of politically cashing in on the red-
baiting racket, bulldozed through the City Council a
resolution to set up a city ”Un-American” Committee.
This proposition would have even less legal and con-
stitutional basis than that of the national witch-hunt-
ing ”Un-American” Committee.

In the attempt to stampede the citizens of Los
Angeles by a synthetic fear of ”Communism,” Daven-
port is trying to disrupt the progressive forces of
our city, insure reactionary control of the city gov-
ernment by himself and his colleagues, and turn Los
Angeles back to the days of the open-shop, when
the Merchants and Manufacturers Ass’n, the corrupt
administration of Mayor Shaw, and police terrorism,
reigned supreme.

To expose the falsity of this manufactured ”fear
of Communism,” the Los Angeles Communist Party
is herewith reprinting in abbreviated form the state-
ment prepared by Eugene Dennis, General Secretary
of the Communist Party, for presentation to the
House Un-American Committee, which the Un-Ameri-
can Committee refused to hear.

Statement of Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party:

I am Eugene Dennis, the General Secretary of the
American Communist Party. I appear in opposition
to the Rankin Bill, HR 1884, and the Shepard Bill,
HR 2122.

I am here to defend the inalienable right of Ameri-
cans to be Communists. I am here to defend the
constitutional right of the Communist Party to
function as_ a legal political party which openly
presents its views, its program and its candidates
to the American people.

In so doing, I in fact defend the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights—which HR 2122 and HR 1884
propose to nullify. I defend the right of the American
people to promote the welfare and advance and
social progress of the nation by democratic means
and in the spirit of America’s progressive traditions.
HR 2122 and HR 1884 place this basic right in
jeopardy, They propose to usurp for a party in power
the right to pass upon the political programs of other
parties—although the Constitution reserves this
right to the people and to the people alone.

HR 1884 is in conﬂ-ict with Secretary‘ Marshall’s declara-
tion that “Freely constituted political parties * should be in-
sured the right to participate in a free and competitive
election system in which each is accorded equal opportunity
to present its views, win adherents and obtain just repre-
sentation.” _ -

On one premise, and on only one premise, can HR 1884
be reconciled with the Secretary of State’s enunciation of
American policy. That is on the premise the German people

are to be trusted to make a wise use of democratic liberties

—while the4American people are not. Does this Committee
care to go to the American people with that thesis?

“SO WIDE A NET”

Why is it that HR 1884, and all similar so-called anti-
Communist legislation, spreads so very wide a net? Secre-
tary Schwellenbach, among others, argues that this is
unavoidable because only by policing the mind and probing
the heart of every American will it be possible to uncover
the “hidden” Communists. The fact, of course, is that the
overwhelming majority of the members of the ‘ Communist
Party declare themselves openly and with pride. But it
is also unfortunately true that some few of them, for reasons
of economic security, ﬁnd it necessary to avoid public
announcement of their Communist aﬁiliation.

I shall propose a joint resolution by the two Houses of
Congress, which will state that it is the sense of the
Congress that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights afford
to members of the Communist Party the same protection

afforded to all other American citizens. The joint resolution 9

should further state that the Congress interprets Secretary
Marshall's declaration that all patriotic citizens shall be
permitted to live without “fear of being denied the right
to work or deprived of life, liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness” to apply without discrimination for race, creed, national
origin or political belief—and to make no exception of Com-
munist Party members.

Finally, the joint resolution shall state that Congress
holds there shall be no discrimination against Communists
or other anti-fascists—Negro or white— in either private
or public employment or in the right to run for and hold
public oﬂice or office in a trade union or other democratic
organization. 0

I pledge that on the day Congress adopts such a resolu-
tion, every single member of my Party will be more than
happy and willing to publicly declare his Communist affilia-
tion, of which he is so proud!

15,000 COMMUNIST VETS

I now come to the allegations that the American Commu- -

nist Party is the “agent of a foreign power” that it “advo-
cates the overthrow of the United States Government by
force and violence”; and that it is not a political party i
the accepted sense, but “a conspiracy.” I .

As to the ﬁrst of these slanders—It is a lie that the
American Communists are agents of a foreign power. That
was what Hitler said of the German Communists, Quisling
of the Norwegian Communists, Laval and Doriot (the French
Louis Budenz) of the French Communists. When V-E Day
came just two years ago, the peoples of the world rejoiced
that “the lie was dead and damned and the truth stood
up instead.” But now, on the eve of the second anniversary
of V-E'Day, Hitler’s Big Lie rises again here in our America
to shame the living and desecrate the war dead.

-Loyalty and patriotism must be judged by the test to
which they are put in the most bitter and costly war of
our nation’s history. We American Communists pass that
acid test with ﬂying colors, and no group or individual can
escape its judgment.

To charge that we are Soviet agents is to deny the fact
that there were Marxists in America long before there was
a Soviet Union. These early Socialists, were the early for-
bears of the modern American Communist Party, stood with
Lincoln against the slaveholders’ rebellion. Lincoln did not
doubt their loyalty. He made the Communist Joseph Wede-
myer a colonel in the Union army.

COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL

It is now seven years since the American Communist
Party severed its connection with the Communist Interna-

-Va.-<r,,,,, ‘A M x, , .  

tional. At that time we acted on our own initiative, to meet
the special conditions arising in our country out of the
Voorhis Act-which we condemned. It is now four years
since the Communist International voluntarily dissolved, by
the vote of its aiﬁiliated parties.

.During the years of our organizational aiﬁliation to the
Communist International we published in our press com-
munications we received from that body. We made no secret
of the fact that we sent delegates to its international con-
gresses. They came home and reported publicly to as many
Americans as would listen to them. They reported publicly
to our Party members, without whose approval Communist
International decisions had no validity for us.

We were at particular pains to publicize as widely as
possible the decisions of the Seventh Congress of the Com-
munist International in 1935. The heroic Bulgarian, Georgi
Dimitrov, presided over that historic Congress. Even the
members of this Committee must admit that Dimitrov, was
well qualiﬁed by ﬁrst-hand experience to lead a discussion
on the subject of how to ﬁght fascism.

The Seventh Congress of the C.I., to which we American
Communists made important contributions, prepared the
way for the dissolution of the Communist International. It
registered the fact that the Communist Parties of the world
were independent organizations, each of native origin, and
making their own decisions. It corrected some mistakes by
young Marxists who were just beginning to learn that
Marxism is a scientiﬁc guide to action, and not a dogma.
It called on the Communist Parties of the world to check and
defeat the fascists in every land by studying the concrete

“- conditions and the special methods of fascism in each country.
‘ It called on them to rally and mobilize the workers and

people of every nation for united action against fascism

and war. ,

What does Mr. J. Edgar Hoover know now about the
Communist International that he didn't know when it was
in existence? Why does the F.B.I. consider the American
Communist Party a more dangerous “foreign agent” seven
years after it left the Communist International than it was
while it maintained that aiﬁliation?

We Communists are the ﬁrst to admit that some of us
made more than a few mistakes and did many infantile
things in the period of our immaturity. But Mr. Hoover
will ﬁnd no evidence of Communist “crime” in his ﬁles.
Even Mr. Hoover himself, is witness that we Communists
never in any way or at any time injured or subverted the
government of the United States.

It was after J. Edgar Hoover had directed the arrest
of thousands of real and suspected Communists in 1920, as
the officer in charge of the infamous Palmer Raids, that
he himself oﬂicially admitted that the Communists had not
been guilty of “any violation of the federal laws.” This
admission was made in an inner-office memorandum to Assist-
ant Attorney General Donovan on Oct. 16, 1924, several
months after Hoover was made Acting Director of the FBI.
Attorney General Harlan Stone, later a Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court, secured this reluctant admission from
Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.

On May 15, 1924, Attorney’ General Stone declared: “The
bureau of investigation is not concerned with political or
other opinions of individuals. It is concerned only with
such conduct as is forbidden by the laws of the United
States. When a police system passes beyond these limits,
it is dangerous to the proper administration of justice and
to human liberty, which it should be our ﬁrst concern to
cherish.”

Neither we Communists nor these millions who work
for peace oppose a strong national defense or wish to weaken
our country in order to strengthen some other power. We
and they know that America's national security does not
rest on “secret weapons” but on policies which will promote
a prosperous and anti-fascist America in a democratic and
peaceful world.

It is, of course, also untrue that the Communist Party
has ever in the past advocated, or advocates today, the use
of force and violence either as a means for achieving govern-
mental change or as a method of struggle for immediate
economic ‘or social gains by labor and the people’s forces
generally.

"‘FORCE AND VIOLENCE’?

Congressman Sheppard's Bill repeats this moth-eaten
charge of force and violence. But HR 2122 oﬂ’ers no proof,
and there is no proof that can be offered. Many attempts
have been made in the press and the courts of this land
to establish such proof, but every one of them has failed.
In the 28 years of our Party's existence, not a single Ameri-
can Communist has ever been proven or convicted of acting
or conspiring to employ force and violence to overthrow the
Government of the United States. It is therefore obvious

that such a charge cannot possibly be upheld against our

Party as a whole.

I shall submit new for the record the full text of the
Constitution of our Party. (Exhibit D.) I read now from
Article IV, Section 10: “Every member is obligated to ﬁght
with all his strength against any and every effort, whether
it comes from abroad or from within our country, to destroy
the rights of labor and the people, or any section thereof,

or to impose upon the United States the arbitrary will of ‘

any group or party or clique or conspiracy, thereby violat-
ing the unqualiﬁed right of the majority of the people to
direct the destinies of our country.” »

I read also from Section 2 of Article IX: “Adherence to
or participation in the activities of any clique, group, circle,
faction or party which conspires or acts to subvert, under-
mine, weaken or overthrow any or all institutions of Ameri-
can democracy, whereby the American people can maintain
their right to determine their destiny in any degree, shall be
punished by immediate expulsion.”

Fascist terror is force and violence in their most brutal

form. Where it reigns there can be no democratic and orderly
progress.

A «-...,. ET-.r:-$/_~§;‘r 4.;-,. ,«~...—

We Communists have never made any secret of the fact
that our ultimate objective is socialism. But there is nothing
in this fact to substantiate the charges that We are a “con-
spiracy,” that we are “foreign agents,” or that we advocate
the “overthrow of the United States government by force
and violence.”

As American workers We strive publicly and by demo-
cratic means to convince the American people that socialism
is the only way to end the scourge of economic crisis, unem-
ployment and violent class conﬂict. We strive to convince
them that only socialism can once and for all put an end
to reaction, fascism and war which are engendered by
monopoly capitalism.

We Communists are conﬁdent that the day will come when
the majority of Americans will decide by their own free
choice, on the basis of their own experience and in harmony
with their fundamental _ interests, to march forward along
the road of social progress toward socialism—that is, to
establish the common ownership of the national economy
under a government of the people, led by the working class.

As Marxists, we know the road cannot be mapped out
in advance. It will be prospected and cleared by the millions
of democratic Americans who seek it. It will be an American
road, opening new frontiers for the traditions of American
democracy and built according to American speciﬁcations
by the common people of America who develop further the
democratic know-how which is ours.

MARXISM AND PATRIOTISM

Our path will not necessarily follow the twists and turns

. taken by the peoplesraf other countries who also, because of the .
inexorable logic of economic and social development, move V

toward a similar goal.

We Communists are not utopians, and come what may,
we are not nor ever will be adventurers. Marxism and patrio-
otism alike teach us that We must differentiate between
what is possible today and what can be realized tomorrow.

The better and more progressive America toward which
we strive can be built only by the American people, led by
labor, and on the foundation of a stronger American
democracy.

We American Communists are here to stay. We will endure
as long as America’s working people endure. Regardless
of what repressive measures against our Party in violation
of the Constitution and the basic democratic principles upon
which our nation was founded-—hundreds of thousands of
American workers and progressives will learn to be Ameri-
can Communists. Their school is the struggle of America’s
common people against the American trusts and empire
builders. -

In the agony of his last torture, Galileo told his inquisi-
tors, “the earth still moves.” We Communists know that
human society moves, and that it moves in the direction of
democratic advance and social progress.

Here in our America we wish to move along democratic
paths by peaceful means.

We call on all Americans who share this wish, whatever
may be their differences with us Communists on other
questions, to oppose and work for the defeat of HR 1884,
HR 2122 and all similar legislation. We cgll with conﬁdence

«on all patriotic Americans to check the pro-fascist conspiracy

which now menacesp the QBill of Rights and the United
Nations.
