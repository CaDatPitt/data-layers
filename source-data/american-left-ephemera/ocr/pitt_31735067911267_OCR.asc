' DENVER, Co1o.— Mine-Mill’s 1951 bargaining campaign was pushed.

, .

‘ least, mean business. The time__

 

 l':D’enver bargaining. parley says:

into high gear last week as more than 65 delegates to a joint national
bargaining meeting adopted strategy aimed at quick action to end the

two-month stall of the operators.

The delegates,‘ representing not only the National Wage Policy
_Commitee but also the Mine-Mill bargaining councils in Anaconda,
EKennecot_t, Phelps-Dodge, American Smelting & Refining, and in the
Northwest, called attention to the “stubborn refusal” of the operators
“to make a serious counter-offer to our 1951 wage and contract
fdemands.” (See page 3 for text of policy statement.)

«The delegates agreed they would make “one more try.’.’ to obtain a
reasonable counter-offer from the major operators in the industry, but

at the same time they made clear
that strike action was in the pic-
ture with the declaration that:
.“UNLESS THE COMPANIES
show genuine evidence of willing-
ness to bargain in good faith
forthwith, we shall be forced to
undertake economic action aimed
at demonstrating that we, at

for stalling, hedging _and maneu-
yering by the companies is past.”
‘ As a part of the over-all plan
for tightening the union’s bar-
gaining mobilization, the dele-
gates agreed to secure authoriza-
tion from the various locals for
the International Union to take
a simultaneous strike vote in the
major sections of the industry.
One speaker after another
jcalled attention to the high
degree of unity and coordination
achieved by the bargaining coun-
icils throughout the International
{Union in this year’s bargaining.
Uknd they expressed determina-

tion to exploit that -unity to the

 



hilt in order to win a settlement
of their major demands.

“We made these demands in all
seriousness,” they said, ‘ “after
weeks of careful discussion and
debate, and our members are de-
jernﬁned that the metal mag-

' nates take them seriously.”

Reminding the operators that

-almost of the major contracts in

the industry terminated "June .30’,
the delegates-‘declared that “Our
members cannot long tolerate a

‘situation-where they continue to.

work without the protection of
_'contracts-.« Nor can they long tol-
erate the tight-lipped refusal of

ANSWERING the phony claim

to permit any third party from

“We know the Wage Stabiliza-

LOS ANGELES (FP)—Alfred Guas-

’perjury by a superior court" jury of —

seven women and five men_ after 12

payroll of the company.

BAYARD, N. M.—The brave women
of Bayard still held the picket line at
the Empire Zinc mines here as the
nine-month-old strike by members of
Mine-Mill Local‘ 890 was gaining the
support of Grant County business men
and other citizens. Against incredible
odds, the strikers and their wives were
holding their own against the com-
bined fury of corporation gunmen and
corrupt strikebreaking law enforcement
officials.

Every conceivable legal and extra-
legal weapon was being used by the
company and its stooges in local gov-
ernment in futile attempts to destroy
the strikers’ morale and to force them
back to work. -

But the story of the Empire strike
is the story of courage and the det_er-
mination of working men and their
families not to let a greedy corpora-

longshoremen support

Lewis’ labor unity plea .\

SAN FRANCISCO (FP)—The Int’l
Longshoremen’s & Warehousemen’s
Union executive board sent a wire .to
president John L. Lewis of the United
Mine Workers “wholeheartedly” in-
dorsing his proposal “to pool and
solidify the mass strength of the la-
bor unions of this country.”

The wirelcongratulated the mine un-
ionlleader on his speech in Detroit at
an anniversary celebration of Eord.Lo-
cal 600, United Auto Workers. _

“We wholeheartedly indorse your
position for united action by all of

labor,” the_:wire said, “and urge that,
you continue your efforts to have

American labor adopt such a program.
“Our union stands ready, to support;
to the-best of our ability and resources.
your position and to look forward to
the day when billions now spent for
war and. corporate profits may be used
instead for peace and prosperity of the
American people.”

tion force down their already inade-
quate living' standards. This strike is
a fight for bread and butter. It is also
a battle in the best traditions of Mine-
Mill. _ \

_.These developments were known at
press time for THE UNION:

1. Twelve strikers arrested on June
11 on charges of “obstructing a public
highway” when the company attempted
to open the mine were found guilty by

a justice of the peace. Int’l rep. Clin-V

ton Jencks was sentenced to 20 days
in jail. The other 11' men were given
1.0 days’ suspended sentences and were
fined $30 each. The convictions are
being appealed by the union. ,

2. A “show cause” contempt of_court
order was served on Jencks, Local
president Cipriano Montoya, and the
entire local bargaining committee. The
men have been ordered to appear in

court July 20. _
" 3. Two women whose names were

not immediately ‘learned by THE UN-
ION were blackjacked- by company
gunmen. The gunmen were not arrest-
ed. At the same time,'~a scab was
found injured and company,-plaid depu-
ties picked up six strikers and charged
them with “assault with intent. to maim
and murder.” ' ' _. '

4. A temporary court injunction
bairing strikers andtheir wives from
preventing the entrance of scabs into

the mines was made" permanent. The .

language of the injunction issued by

Judge Marshalllwas identical with that .

requested by company attorneys.-
MEANWEILE, other public officials

and local business men were rallying
. ‘to the defense of the strikers. A let-

ter signed‘ by the mayor" and three
trustees of the Village of Bayard was
sent to the company, urging the com-
mencement of immediate negotiations
“fg-r the purpose of meeting your ob-
ligations to the workers and the people
of this community.” The letter said
that “failing to grant these established

A LOS ANGELES, Ca1if.——-The
third of five die cast shops repre-
sented by Mine-Mill went out on
‘strike here July 5 as the em-
ployers continued to refuse to

4 make serious counter wage pro-
‘ posals and attempted to split the
solidarity of the workers who
, have been protected for years by a
 master contract covering all five com-
 ‘ panies. .
l 5-I V’ The third shop to be struck is Har-
‘ vill Die Casting. Previously, workers
at the Anderson and’ Union plants
walked out when company negotiators
refused to budge. The Harvill walkout
was_100 per cent effective and the
' company was forced to suspend oper-
ations. » ‘
The Anderson management, mean-
while, began the recruiting of strike-
breakers in an attempted back-to-
"Work movement. At press time, the
move was a failure and the strikers
were still solid and maintaining their
V picket lines and other strike activities.
. FIFTY. INTENDED strikebreakers
"recruited in Bakersfield refused to
, cross the picket line when they learned
1, “=8. strike was in progress. The com-
" pany had not told them they were to
be used as strikebreakers. They all
returned to Bakersfield. Similar at-

panies to hire strikebreakerspin Sac-
~ ramento. Only 11 scabs were recruit-
1' ed by Anderson up to July 5.
 The strike strategy committee is a
 joint operation and is representative
 of all five shops covered by the mas-
fll ter. contract. The two shops not yet on
fﬂstrike are Los Angeles Die Cast and
' Universal. I

. Ahearing before a state deputy la-
bor commission was scheduled for July
2313, ‘at which time a complaint issued
,by the state against the Anderson com-
jeipany was to be heard. The complaint
charges that the company violated the
State labor code by recruiting scabs.
"Fast due-vacation pay also will be the
subject of a hearing before the law
\ orcement division.
. UNION DIECAST tried its own‘ver-
._sion of back-to-Work with 2: “Dear
"John” letter to the workers. The com-
any got three“ takers to join super-

stayed out. Meanwhile, the three who
"crossed the line were being reached in
:order to convince them to leave the
plant ‘again. There was some indica-
tion thatfunion efforts along this line
have been successful. V A

, On July 10 it was reported that _the
Harvill and Universal manageme/nts
had met with the union. The meeting
_ broke up when it became apparent that
these two companies were banking on

The moment has come for the corporations in this industry to’

Kefuuver report

WASHINGTON, D. C. — Phelps-
Dodge Copper Co. was the target of a
sharp rebuke by the Kefauver Senate
Crime Investigating Committee in. its
third report. The report said: ’ ‘

“One of the -most shocking prob-.

lerns in this connection, and one which
constitutes a black page in the history
of American industry, is the indispu-
table evidence obtained by .the' com-
mittee of cooperation with major hood-’
lums on the part of important seg-
ments of business enterprise. ‘

“In. Detroit, the committee, found
leading industrial concerns, admittedly
cooperating with notorious "hoodlums
for the purpose of suppressing labor
difficulties. In: New ‘York, the same’
situation prevailed in connection with
the Phelps-Dodge Company, which in-

vited in hoodlums from the gang-l‘of'

Albert and Anthony Anastasia to help

Union spokesmen prove
’ . BIS index is phony

WASHINGTON-—The House labor .

subc 'mitte hearings on the accuracy

' of «t e BLSr “consumer price index”'

have ‘ended after Bureau Commissioner

Ewan Clague ducked any answer to
most questions raised by organized
labor. . ' I V .

- Committee chairman Tom Steed (D.-
Okla.) closed the hearings after Clague
was given ‘a chance to answer claims
made by many unions—including Mine-
Mill—that the index is NOT a cost-of-
living measure, though it is so used by
government and industry. _

Labor also demonstrated that the
index seriously under-estimated -actual

prices paid by consumers. And the _,
trade. ‘unions which -testified showed-

the wide differencebetween Bureau or
Labor ‘Statistics figures on cost-of-
living and those of the Bureau of Ag-
ricultural Economics, which are much
higher for the sameitems. "

The United Electrical, Radio & Ma-
chine Workers had madean elaborate
presentation. to show the index falls
far short of a cost-of-living measure.
These criticisms were backed by the

, AFL, CIO, Mine-Mill and other unions.

All Clague could say was: “There is
little indication in testimony before the
committee that the price -index is not
useful as a cost-of—livingA_index.”

Congress moving to let prices

/WASHINGTON—The U. s. Cham-
ber of Commerce and the National
Ass’n of Manufacturers are moving to
prevent any more rulings by the Wage
Stabilization Board allowing any con-
cessions to unions above the phony
present formula of 10 per cent-over
the level of January, 1950. .

The Big Business move-isembodied
in an ‘amendment to the “Defense Pro-
duction Act,” sponsored» by -Rep. Lucas
(D, Texas). ' '

Even George W. Taylor, WSB chair-

V man, whohas accepted the present out-

rageous Wage-freeze machinery, at-
tacked the Lucas proposal bitterly.

Sen. Robert A. Taft (R, Ohio), co-
author of the -hated, Taft-Hartley law,
is _heading the move to push the bill
through the upper house.

The extreme nature of the Lucas,
proposal can be seen in the objections
raised by Taylor: '

(1) In- effect it establishes an all-
public member nbO8.l'd,‘_ with industry
and labor representatives occupying
meaningless positions; (2) it estab-
lishes a mechanical and absolute sys-
tem of mass wage control which would
overlook individual case inequities and
cause’ labor unrest which would start
strikes; and (3) “this would inevitably
lead to elimination of the right to
strike.” ' —

wage rates exposed ‘

HAMILTON, Ont.—Wage policies of
the CIO Steelworkers union were being
exposed here this month in announce-

And the exposure showed just how far
behind Mine-Mill the Steel union rates
-actually are. S

the Steel union was able to win a 10
cent wage increase which brought the
base rate up to $1.27 an hour. In King-
ston, the Steel union’s new base rate at
Aluminum Co. of Canada is only $1.18
an hour.

Steel union miners at the Noranda
Copper mine are only $1.19, compared
with $1.66 paid Mine-Mill miners in
Sudbury. Smelter rates for Steel mem-

$1.24, compared with $1.56% to $1.791/5
«in Sudbury. ‘
The figures helped to explain why

failed miserably, despite the expendi-
ture of‘ more than $250,000 in the raid-
ing activities.

, How’d you like the cost-of-livinig to

.- . go up a dollar a day for your family?

‘ '- - How’d you like to know that this
living cost increase—totaling an esti-
mated $12 -billion a year for food,
clothing and other essentials was
handed to you with the blessings-of
“CIO president Philip,Murray and AFL
president Green?

That’s exactly what is happening.

,_ The story goes back to March, when
i _the top leaders of AFL and CIO an-
nounced they were boycotting the Wage
,_ Stabilization Board and all other war
“agencies. The AFL and CIO acted’
jointly ingwhat they called the United
_’ ’Labor Policy Committee. The ULPC
- _ was_ finally persuaded by ‘President
 Truman to/get back in line, when the
_, President promised to make Murray
B. and Green members of a new Board.

The Board on which Murray and
Green were placed with much pomp and"
‘ ceremony was the National Advisory
Board on Mobilization Policy. This
Board has now sent its first "major
“recommendations” to Congress in the
form of a report to Vice President
‘Barkley and House Speaker Rayburn.
‘ The REPORT is shocking. It is even
‘i\ more" shocking when you learn it was
signedby both Murray and Green. It
should. raise a. lot of questions in the
minds of the ‘15 million organized work-
i ers .in the USA. It says, for example:
“The mobilization effort has already
developed a ‘well-conceived strategy
and program for the expansion of
production.” ‘ _
Question: Does this mean that the
 labor members of the Board approve
',,the'-outright gift of more than $51/2

Does this mean "the workers

The amazing thing about this docu-
ment is that it was issued after the

newspapers began to print. reports of ’

new overtures from the Chinese Re-

public and North Korea aimed at a

cease-fire.

Even more amazing is the fact that
it was issued on the eve of the big
fight in Congressover wage and price
controls. Congress was about to de-
cide whether to throw price control out,
the window and tight_en up wage con-

trol, or whether’ to answer the needs

of all American workers and order real
price control.

But the.labor_“leaders,” Murray and
Green, signed the report which in ef-

Mine-Mill into the Progressive Metal-_
workers Council, and then. into CIO.
Steel, were on strike for something bet-
ter than a phony “deal"’ cooked .up by
Steel officials Haycock and Rasmussen.

day, with all other rates adjusted up-

ward on the same basis. Steel officials _

succeeded in forcing this peanut plan
on their other locals in Utah and Ne-
vada using the argument that,‘-*-it was
a basis for “further negotiations.”
The piecard deal was a major retreat’
from the position taken by Haycock and
Rasmussen when they ordered a strike

vote late in June in an unsuccesful at-’

tempt to bluff the company. When the

bluff failed completely, the Steel lead-L‘

ers beat a hasty retreat.

The same “deal” that was accepted
by Haycock and Rasmussen was also
offered to Mine-Mill negotiators—and
quickly rejected as totally inadequate. .

Tungsten price scandal is

WASHINGTON.—The, “tungsten.

’ scandal” is being,widely'dis'cussed here,

following its exposure in a report of the
Senate preparedness committee.

The report shows how short-sighted.‘
practices in the armed services will
cost U. _S. taxpayers billions of dollars
in excessive prices _for tungsten for
years to come. “This sad plight can be

_traced largely to the game of blind ,

man's bluff played by. the Munitions

Board and the army,” said theicom-, :.

mittee headed by Sen. Lyndon Johnson
(D, Tex.)._ - _ _ e ‘
“For nearly three years no one-ab-
solutely no one-_— informed the Muni-
tions Board of. the amount of tungsten

required for the army's core program - 1 _

and the, board made enogeffort to find
out about it,” the reportsaid. Here is
the cbmmittee summed

During theyearspe just after World’

1 War II the'U. S. could have bought all _

the tungsten lit _wanted-«or could pos-
sibly use in the foreseeabfe future from

‘China; whose ‘tungsten deposits are the
‘ greatest and of the (highest grade in
the world.- Prices had fallen to very

low levels; China, thereport said, was ‘
then ‘under,;a.\“friendly”. government. 7
But the army and Munitions ‘Board

were’ acting as-: though .ne’ither had any 

use for ;tun'gsten.?:. Nothing,-.yvas done.i"

was‘ cut off. After war broke out in

Korea, the U. S. found it could not get '

along without tungsten and it didn’€
have anything like as much as itneeded,
_AT THIS POINT the General Serv-

ices Administration and the Office of. I

Price Stabilization wanted to engage in
a long-term program of’ stimulating

_ domestic and South American produc-

   

tion by a slow price rise policy. A
But the Defense Minerals ‘Adminis-

tration, under domination of militaryf 

brass and bigbusiness leadership in the"
mobilization program, insisted on a
wild inflation system on tungsten. They_
forced the adoption _of V 'a high ceiling

Steel raids Canadian AFL

. _ with the assistance of the International:

LONDON, Ont. —— Charlie Mallard, '

Canadian‘ director of the CIO Steel-
woirkers Union, has embarked on a new
‘raiding project, following the decisive
defeat of all his raids against Mine-
Mill locals in this country.

He has ordered Steel “organizers”'

into this city, where the London & Dis-
trict Trades and Labor Council was told
recently that /he is “deliberately map-
ping, acampaign” to break'“AFL unions.
”It’s most disappointing, and not good

» me-Mill to resume bargaining  
TEHACHAPI, Ca1if.—After two years’ loss, of bargaining rights

because of an AFL-company backdoor deal, Mine-Mill Local 550 again
is in position to force.Monolith-Portland Cement Company to grant

recognition.

Int’l rep. Howard Goddard said dryly that “after a two-year
interruption of bargaining, our demands will be somewhat higher.”

End" of the backdoor deal came with
a .long-delayed decision and order of
the National Labor Relations Board.

The order finds the ‘company and the V

AFL Cement, Lime & Gypsum Workers
guilty of entering into an illegal agree-
ment and sets ‘aside. -the contract.’ It

‘also findsthat the company and the

AFL conspired to coerce and intimidate

workers into joining the. AFL union.‘
CHARGES ' ;wERE. “FILED , shortly

after Monolith signed a secret, back-

door contract with the AFL union in.

July 1949.‘ The illegal contract was
entered into less than thr_e'e weeks‘ af-
ter the NLRB had conducted an elec-

tion in the plant and the AFL had‘

been decisively defeated.

llline-Miiﬂ Local 550 had been the
bargaining representative of the Mono-
lith workers since‘ 1941. Periodically
the AFL union had attempted to raid,
but on each occasion had been rejected
by the workers. The 1949 raid came,
as usual, in the midst of negotiations.

The company refused to continue ne-
gotiations with Mine-Mill until the rep-
resentation question had been settled.
Because Mine—Mill’s status at that time
under Taft-Hartley was one of non-
compliance, Local 550 was refused a
place on the ballot, but nevertheless
campaigned for a “no” vote. The coi-
pany promised, prior to the election, to
'continue its recognition of and nego-
tiations with" Mine-Mill in the event
of a“‘n‘o” vote majority inthe election.

THE “NO” VOTE carried by a large
majority, butthe company disregarded
its-promise and shortly thereafter sign-
ed -the phony contract with the AFL for
a five year term and without reopen-
ing provisions._ Seniority rights were
accorded only to AFL members. Many
hard won provisions of the Mine-Mill
contract were thrown overboard.

The‘NLR'B conducted a hearing on
Mine-Mill’s charges in May, 1950. The
Trial Examiner’s Intermediate Report
was handed.down in July 1950. Another
year passed before the Board finally is-
sued its order. .

In the meantime, Local 550 members
have retained their organization and

Union they have fought the company-

AFL alliance every step of the way. a‘ ~ '

Despite all kinds /of pressure designed
to induce them to accept the yoke of ‘

steadfast as members of Mine-Mill and
would have no part of the sell-out AFL
outfit. A steady campaign of pressure

Local 598 opens A  
summer program

SUDBURY, Ont.———Summer has come
to pntario, but Mine-Mill activities in
these parts continue at a high pitch.

Local 598 opened its summer Day

Mine-Mill helps us

PETERBOROUGH, Ont. — J a m e s
Carey’s “Imitation” Electrical Work-
ers, also known as IUE-CIO, was
soundly trounced by the independent
United Electrical Radio & Machine
Workers in an election.at the Canadian
General Electric plant. _

Although the IUE raid was backed
by the Canadian Congress of Labor and
the CIO Steelworkers, UE rolled up
1,909 votes as against 1,582 for IUE.
Thedefeat marked another link in a
long chain of recent’ disasters for raid-
ing CIO unions. , .

Among those who took part in the _

Presidents are accused of having a
“clique” whether they do or not. And
even if they do, can we ‘say it is in-
tentional or not? Most of the time it
is accidental. Why?

Most of us have noticed how re-
sponsibilities fall _on the shoulders of
the man who can handle them. Some-
times-not to‘one man, butto ‘a small
group of men. Then comes ghe “clique”.
or “set” :in the union that we hear so
much about. ~ ' ‘ _

DID YOU EVER stop to analyze the

. thing‘? Let’s forget the hogwash. Let’s

stop being ‘Thatchet men,” the kind of
member who won’t do anything but
crab, complain or criticize. Let’s” get
down to the facts about “cliques.”
How many generally _make «up this

‘ unholy alliance ‘of ogres called the

“clique”? Hardly ‘more than" a hand-
ful,_ a half dozen perhaps. Ah-ha! Well
then; if you're such a “big shot,” so
brilliant and all that, why‘ don’t you
come.-rout and give the -meeting the
benefit of your magnificent “ brain?

That’s better than staying away fl'0Il_|.'

In/short, if you’re sodamned smart, if a

it! . ~ V '

from ruin.’ Get ‘out there. and pu,t_them€_" '

. ruining the union—as you say—is real-

ly made up of the no-good in<_:o|_npe-
tent, low-down, lop-eared misfits you
think they are, why don’t you attempt
to do something about it? Go after
them.

, Ever stop to think how easy it would
be to upset their applecart? Remem-
ber, they can’t be too big; there can’t
be top many .of_ them; if they were

- IF MOST UNION members would
come»-out «and do theirvduty as they
should, there.w_ouldn’t be-any room‘ for
cligues or sets. It’s the guys who stay
away whoare to blame if your local
is “being run by the brass.” If_ you
"want to see things boom, come out
with your gang and show what you
can do-and watch the president grin
from year to ear. -

Maybe you’ll get an unexpected wel-

‘ come that’ll floor. you. Maybe you and.

your gang will merge with the clique
that’s been running the union. ~Then

»you’ll_ really go to town, as you should

have in the first place. Then_ you won’t
say any more: “No use togo out to
meetings as long as thatfclique’ is
running things.” i

’ Remember, you can’t 3 keep a good
man down——or a good union president
-——or a good union. If. meetings are
dull, uninteresting, dead, it’s ‘your duty
to bring them back to life and freshen

' them up. Don’t blow if you can’t show.

Your union president needs any ideas
(you can suggest. Ideas are like oysters.
It takes a lot of them to find’ a pearl.
Maybe'_you’re the guy who’ll turn up

‘ a pearl for the local. H .
~\ In no tiine flat you’ll be one of the

clique\you used to raiseso much fuss‘
abou.t._Y.\u’1l be one of them. You'll be S
surprised to discover they can turn out
to be pretty nice fellows.

. When the top man in-your local’ took
the obligation as president, he showed
he’s ready todo his best for us. What

are we going to do for him?

The high point of labor’s participa-
tion» in the congress was the “labor
workshop” in which all of the trade
unionists participated. «The workshop
adopteda program designed to involve

the millions of trade unionists "not now:

 actively participating in the crusade
.— for peace. In addition, the labor dele-
gates voted to establish their own peace
organization, co-operating informally
with the American Peace Crusade but
not affiliated. . . ‘- . A

Bridges, president of the Longshore-
men and. Warehousemen. .1 Co-‘chairman

 was Leon Beverly‘ of the C10" Packing-

" house Workers.‘ The reporter for the
workshop was ‘Michael Woods, district
president of the

Travis presented the main document of
the workshop which had been drafted
by the labor sponsors of the congress.

The document which was presented

"by Brother .Travis showed the real,

breadth of labor’s participation.
“Labor has a, special stake in peace,”

the statement began. “It is labor that _

does most of the’ dying, most of the
fighting, most of the paying.‘ In every
country of the world, it is the working
people who have the least to ‘gain from
war,J.‘he most to gain from peace. It
is the working people of each country
who can most readily agree that war
iszun_necessary. Workers who do not
‘profit from ‘tour have no incentive to
make war on wo-rkefrs of different na-
‘tionalities.”

THE STATEMENT continued with
the declaration that “labor is against
war because only under peace can the
basic aims and purposes of the trade
union movement be realized. A war
situation strikes at the very heart of
why our unions were organized. War

establishes an official government pol- .

icy of lowering the standards of living
of the -American people. War brings
wage freezes, compulsory arbitration
' of wages: and the drastic restriction of
our rights as trade unionists. War
undermines civil rights, especially of
the Negro workers and workers of
other minority groups. War abolishes
free collective bargaining, the free
-choice of jobs, the freedom to use tra-
ditional weapons. to achieve redress of
grievances and speedup. War inevita-
bly must impoverish the people.”
The labor delegates hailed “the in-
structions of our government to our

military leaders to negotiate a truce in -

’ Korea.” They lauded the “transfer of
international differences to the confer-
ence table where they belongf,’ They

~ declared. that -“as ‘trade, unionists, we
are in full accord’/ with a policy of ne-
gotiation because we know the value of
negotiations.” ' A , . ',

The trade unionists expressed con-
cern with “the economic impact of the
War on the worki_ng people,” calling it

“one of the most alarming results of .

war}? ~  .\ . .

year,” the statement said, “a cnpper
miner had to work a full hour and a

half longerto buy the same basket of —
food, he bought in June of 19,/,6. Who

stole that hoursand ‘a half?”

SUPER-PROFITS, the War budget,
the large number of corporation .heads
and generals in government, frozen
wages, rising prices and discriminatory
taxation all were cited as part of the
answer to the question.

“The torpedoing of our living stg_nd-
ards is accompanied by frantic propa-
ganda. to convince us that war is good
for us,” the trade bunionists charged.
“The will—o-the-wisp of war jobs is
Wall Street’s pain killer. ‘It is the
same false theory that Hitler used to
soften the resistance of the German
labor movement to HIS war. German

' workers learned too late that war is a

bunco game and that they were the
suckers. We Americawtmde unionists

-do not propose to be suckers.” »

Recognizing that not all sections of
the labor movement are agreed on the
causes of war and labor’s stake _in
peace, the trade unionists at the peace
congress expressed c e rt a in t y that
“there are no differences among us as

7 to the common bond we share in peace.”

time production that would be of last-
ing benefit to the people if the 80 bil-
lion dollar war budget were diverted to

bor’s«-energetic participation in the ex-
panding coalition for peace.”, ‘
“Immediately we want the shooting
stopped, theplans for war ended, -the
negotiations started,” the d. e l e g a t e s

said. “Immediately we want to carry
forward our traditional program of

’ economic and political freedom for our

members. Immediately "We want Pres-
ident Truman to~end the ‘war emer-
gency’ with the cease-fire truce and to
end all by-products ofthe emergency

. including the wage freeze, the scuttling

of the fight for EEPC, discriminatory
taxation, and all proposed restrictions
of labor’s and the people's constitu-
tional rights.” ’ .
