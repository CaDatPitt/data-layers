Bargaining Opens

I  A1l Over Country!

DENVER——Heavy-duty collective bargaining ma-
chinery of the nonferrous metals industry chugged off
to a start last month. There were a few creaks after
three years, but by and large the huge apparatus was
running well and expected to be functioning at top speed

,. devour thousands



‘ als, Miami

and peak efficiency by
June 1.

From now on, the giant will
of man-
hours in negotiating r o o In s
across the country which Mine-

‘ Mill; members are determined

will produce improved wages

and agreements ‘with employ-
ers in 90 per cent of the indus- ‘
‘try.

Nearly all of the contracts
were to terminate on June 30.
These include agreements with
the “Big Four,” A n a c o n d a,
Kennecott, American Smelting
and Refining, and Phelps

. Dodge, as well as those with

Magma-San Manuel, U. S. Met-
Copper, Bunker
Hill, and dozens of other em-
ployers. Following are some
of the developments reported
to. the MINE-MILL UNION at

' month’s end:

PHELPS-DODGE — Negotia-

.. tions were begun May 13 in

-El Paso, Tex., and on May 15

in Douglas, Ariz. The latter
talks Were concerned with the

’Pl;{) Arizona operations. A sec-

- and Arizona session was ‘held

 7-"on May 21 at which an agenda
, was-agre'ed_ upon. covering all
~~ ‘economic issues. O-n\June 3, the
 -parties will meet again-.to ex-

change counter proposals on
non-economic issues. A second
El Paso session is scheduled
for May 28 at which time -the
company is supposed to an-
swer the union’s claim that the
discharge of seven local lead-
ers some months ago is a
moral issue to be resolved in
contract negotiations. ,

A joint bargaining commit-
tee is leading Arizona negotia-
tions for the union, which is
composed of representatives
from local unions in Bisbee,
Douglas, and Morenci, plus a
liaison member from El Paso.
Sylvain Schnaittacher, Mine-
Mill’s Phelps-Dodge council co-
ordinator, is leading negotia-
tions at both Douglas and El
Paso.

Jack Marcotti

Scores a First

Nothing like this ever hap-
pened before in the mining
town of Superior, Ariz., home

 of the Magma Copper com-
pany. On May 5,.by invitation,
a union representative spoke
at the luncheon meeting of
the Superior Rotary Club. The
Club is made up of the town’s

business men and Magma top

management. The union
speaker was Mine-Mill Re-
gional _Director Jack C. Mar-
cotti.

Marcotti addressed the busi-
ness people just prior to the
opening of negotiations the
same day between Mine-Mill
Local 938 and Magma. His
subject was the union’s 1959

‘ bargaining program and its re-
lationship to the community.

His talk and his frank an-
swers to many questions evi-
dently pleased the audience
because he was given a big
round of applause when he
got through. ,

_ Originally, Mine-Mill Vice
President Orville Larson had
been invited to address the
club, but couldn’t make it be-
cause of union commitments
elsewhere at the time. The in-
vitation for Marcotti to sub-
stitute for Larson at the
luncheon came from Superior
attorney Fred Smith, a mem-

' ber of the Arizona State Leg-

islature. The meeting did

A much to establish a better re-

lationship between the union

and the community’s business-
men.

_ Only last June Mine-Mill be-

. ‘ came the first union ever to

' sign a contract with Magma

Whose mining, milling and
smelting operations have con-
stituted Superior’s sole major
industry for nearly fifty years.

‘ Marcotti’s signature is on that
contract.

1Keasbey-Mattrson
Signs With 847
Agreement on a new one-
year contract was reached in
Perth Amboy, N. J., last month
by Local 847 with the Keas-
bey-Mat-tison company. Rati-
fied unanimously at a special
membership meeting, the con-
tract provides for the follow-

ing gains effective May 1: a.

additional $500.00 for each em-

gotiating committee consisting
of President William Billig,
Vice President Charles Hall,

Hey. Democrats!
Where Are You?

A recent leaflet issued by
Chicago Amalgamated Local
758 hits the Eisenhower ad-
ministration for cutting back
funds of the Labor depart-
ment to enforce the federal
wage and hour law. Quoting
information released by Clar-
ence Lundquist, head of the
Labor Department’s wage and
hour division, the leaflet point-
ed out that an investigation of
54,000 companies showed they
had cheated their employes out
of $20 million in one year by
violating- the law’s minimum
wage and overtime require-
ments. Lundquist said that if
his division had the funds to
investigate all 906,000 compa-
nies covered by the law, he
would find violations totaling
at least $80 million.

“Whatabout the Democrats
we elected last fall?” the leaf-
let asked, adding: “We voted
for them to put an end to this
kind of pro-millionaire gov-

ernment.”

Scholarships

. In News Again

Abe Yanez, vice president of
Mine-Mill . L o c a 1 937 - at San
Manuel, Ariz., was named

chairman ‘of the Tri-Commu-‘

nity Scholarship Fund when
representatives of contributing
groups met May 7 at the San
Manuel High School to select
the winner of this year’s $500
scholarship. Edward Jackson,
also of Local 937, was elected
secretary of the Fund commit-
tee Which includes San Man-
uel-Mammoth-Oracle area rep-
resentatives of such organiza-
tions as the Lions club, Le-
gion auxiliary, Elks, American

Legion, Chamber of Com-
merce, PTA, Sheriff’s Posse,
Teachers association other

community groups. The name
of the scholarship winner, kept
secret, was to be announced
later in the month.’

Meanwhile in other scholar-
ship news, the award of a Uni-
versity of California scholar-
ship to former Mine-Mill staff
member Clinton E. Jencks by
the Woodrow Wilson National
Fellowship Foundation became
the target of a vindicative at-
in the Scripps-Howard
newspaper chain last -month.
The Wilson Fellowship pro-
gram is backed by a $25 mil-
lion grant from the Ford Foun-
dation. The Scripps-Howard
papers reported that the schol-
arship granted to Jencks is be-
ing investigated by the House
Un-American
answer, spokesmen for the
Foundation said Jencks got the
award. because of his “top
quality” as a student. They
added that he had been cleared
by the Supreme Court and that
they had found no evidence
that Jencks is a Communist or
ever was one.

Explosion‘ Sets

Show—up pay and seniority

Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, Local 18 .

grievance growing out of the
emergency layoff of 52 men
following a gas explosion at
the Bunker Hill‘ company smel-
ter. At last report, a decision
on the grievance was still
pending.

One of the smelter furnaces
exploded April 30 due to a
power failure and accumula-
tion of gas. The power went
off for a few minutes causing
gas to accumulate in the fur-
nace and back up in the pipes
to the powerhouse. The blast
also tore loose a number of
sections of the lar ge pipes
which were blown completely
out of place in some places.
Fortunately, nobody was in-
jured.

Although the explosion oc-
curred about 11:00 a.m., the
day shift completed its full
time. When the 3-11 shift
came on, however, the com-

pany sent some _52 men home

with orders not to report back
to work until two days later
on a Saturday. The men sent
home were told by their shift-

-ers and supervisors that they

would receive four hours
show-up pay. Among the men
sent home were a number with
more seniority than several
junior men kept on the job by
the company in violation of
the contract. _

At a meeting demanded by
the union with management
the same afternoon a number
of problems were straightened
out, including a return of the
52 men to work the next day
although top supervision tried
to renege on paying them the
four hours show-up time. The
company announcement t h a t
the plant would be back in full
operation ,with the graveyard
shift that same day came as
the union committee were tak-
ing up the matter of keeping
men with seniority on the job
and working out a procedure
for the graveyard shift com-
ing on. -

With all the problems_ set-
tled except for the 3-11, the
union’s position was that the
senior employees be kept on
the job in their departments
when any future emergency
such as this occurred, and fur-
ther that the company pay
four hours show-up time to the
52 men sent home. The com-
pany asked for time to study
the proposal.

Humboldt Local

Wins Increases

Pay increases ranging from
10 to 25 cents an hour were
negotiated by Mine-Mill Local
570 in Humbolt, Kansas, under
a wage reopening clause in
their contract with the Hum-
boldt Brick & Tile company.
The new wage agreement,
reached May 21, extended the
contract’ from its former ex-
piration date in December,
1959, to June 1, 1960. This rep-
resented a gain in the union’s
bargaining position, changing
the negotiations period from
a slow to busy season.

According to Int’l Rep. Jesse
Van Camp who assisted the
Local 570 committee in negoti-
ations, a majority of the
plant’s workers will benefit by

earnings increases of around -

25 cents an hour.‘ The opera-
tion is primarily on piece work
and the negotiated raise is
applied directly onto the in-
centive system, affording the
men the opportunity to make
about $2.00 a day more on their
earnings.

Also negotiated were two
new job classifications adding
two more men to the work
force. The added help, paid
for strictly by and at the ex-
pense of the company, con-
sists of a man to assist the
wheelers and another man for
the shale pit. Both additions
lighten the work load without
reducing the earning capacity
of the men. ‘

On the negotiating commit-
tee were: Robert Gardner,
president;_ James D. McKin-
sey, financial secretary; James
Miller, recording secretary;
Ray McKinsey, George Reibel,
Merle "Zimmerman and Bob
Shear.

Alabama Court Denies Howard Appeal-if 

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

DENVER—Since Feb. 23,
relatives, friends, neighbors,
fellow Mine-Mill "members,-
lawyers, ministers, ‘educators,
businessmen, public officials,
and thousands of civil rights
advocates all over the civilized
world have been trying _to get
Asbury Howard out of jail at
Bessemer, Ala. A ' A A A ’

Three months later, all ef-
forts have failed. The man
who was jailed because he had
a sign painted urging his
Negro neighbors to vote is
still on a jail work gang.

The latest in a series of le-
gal efforts to get the Aeastern
vice-president of Mine-Mill
freed on bail pending. appeal
failed on May 19 when the
Alabama Court’ of Ap p e als
turned down his bid for‘free-
dom. It was reported that the
court had indicated in its opin-
ion that a higher court? should
be asked to rule on the‘ consti-
tutionality of the Bessemer
city ordinance under which
Howard and a white sign

. painter were arrested and con-

victed in a trial which pre-
ceded by minutes’ a mob as-

sault-against the Negro leader.

Two issues were presented
to the court. One challenged
the jurisdiction of the lower
courts and the other the con-
stitutionality of the ordinance.
Ruling only on the first issue,
the appeals court upheld the
lower courts. On the second
issue, the court observed that
part of the ordinance was un-
constitutional and part consti-
tutional. It therefore indicated
a high court could more
properly rule on the issue.
FILE REQUEST

On May 23, exactly three

months after Howard’s im-'
prisonment, it was learned
that a request for a -writ of’-
certiorari had been filed by

his lawyers with the State Su-A‘ 

preme Court. . A .
Meanwhile, new p r o t e 5 ts ‘

The smelter is ownedby the

The daily‘ newspaper, in a

story published May 19, said,

“the union says it will not re-
turn to work until the fired
workers are rehired. The com-
pany says it will not discuss

‘rehiring them until the union

men return to work.” Accord-
ing to the article, the contro-
versy “has idled some 850
workers since March 13."

SUES UNION

The newspaper reports that
“the company sued the union
for damages and later, in a
separate action, souA,srht and re-
ceived an injuncion from
Judge Boldt (U. S. District
Judge George H. Boldt) which
ordered the union to refrain
from engaging in any activi-
ties designed to prevent work-
ers from returningto the job.
The plant opened May 6, but
an affidavit submitted to the
courtiby Plant Manager Rob-
ert E. Shinkowskey and cited
yesterday (May 18) said that
only about one-sixth of the
work force has returned since
May 6.” M

A union spokesman, accord-
ing to the NEWS-TRIBUNE,‘

said “the situation at the
smelter ‘remains unchanged’
this morning. Our count shows
77 union men back to work,
fewer than there were yester-
day.”

A company spokesman was
quoted by the paper as saying
that “118 union men were at
work this morning, a small in-

crease over the number who

reported yesterday. ‘We feel
that when the news of Judge
Boldt’s decision gets around
more men will return’.”

The decision referred to'was
by ‘Judge Boldt, who on May

18_ denied a union; motion by

Attorney John Caughlan to
dissolve or modify an injunc-
tion. He also refused a union
request that the company’s
$10,000 bond be raised to A“at
least $50,000” in its suit for
damages against the union.

ASKED TO MODIFY

According to the News-Triir
une, “Caughlan of Seattle re-
quested that the order be mod-
ified to provide that it end on
June 30 (contract termination
date in the AS&R chain) or
on the date the U. S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Fran-
cisco might strike it down. . . .
The higher court has set June
11 to hear arguments on the
appeal. a

“Judge Boldt also refused
to add words suggested by
Caughlan to the order which

. would require the company to

meet with the union and dis-
cuss grievances before work-
ers return to work."

“The judge said he would

add the words only if the

union requested the workers
to return to work first.
MOUTH SEALED

“Caughlan charged that the
injunction ‘seals the mouth of

the union’ and that to say any-'

thing regarding a return to
work ‘would be a very risky
business’ in View of contempt
of court charges possible for
violations of the order by
those who would speak against
a return.”

The MINE-MILL UNION
has been informed that the
company’s estimate ofmen re-
turning to work since the in-
junction is excessive and in-
cludes a considerabie number
of men called in from the lay-
off list. It is reported that the
company has used a 10-day
registered letter which says, in

  On 3-WeekTour

HE INTERNATIONAL election returns are
comingin, and from reports of local un-
ions to the union’s Denver headquarters, it ap-
pears that Brother Irving Dichter has been
elected for Secretary-Treasurer and Brother
Chase Powers again will serve as Executive
Board Member for District 17.
While three of the constitutional amend-
. ments apparently have been agreed to by the
membership, there is still some doubt about the
_ fate of the most important proposition, that
which asks for a cl1ange_in the assessment
amount which can be levied by the Interna-
tional Executive board.

Under the stress facing the whole labor
movement because of the intent of some of
our Senators and Congressmen to further re-
press trade unions with more stringent legis-
lation, coupled with our negotiations with the
companies in our jurisdiction, this change in

‘ the constitution should have been considered a
must. Our union, however, is built on democ-
racy, and the members make the decisions.

at at at
HAVE just returned from a three weeks’
trip spent in examining and discussing our
problems in negotiations, the metals situation,
and other -fields. I visited Taco-ma, Kellogg-
.Wallace,» East Helena, Great Falls, and Soda
Springs, Idaho. I spent a week with my fellow
miners in‘Butte, adding, my little bit to the
. good job done by them in ousting the Steel and
Chemical raiders from that community. ,
' I found that the interest in our negotiations
is now, of course, predominant, and now that
the decks are cleared of interfering outsiders
. in Butte, we can get into the Anaconda bargain-
ing program and work for the membership in-
stead ofwasting good time fighting labor sabo-
teurs and disorganizers. ' ‘ '
The work that the International union is
doing in the metals situation, and the knowl-
edge that it is bearing some fruit, certainly
create a ‘feeling of optimism that a successful
bargaining program can be accomplished‘ again.

Unemployment  Called
Moral Wrong by Prelate

Employers who lay off their employees as “good business”
and as “economic measures,” were sharply criticized recently
in a joint, declaration by two French Catholicleaders. They are
Cardinal Lienart of Lille, and Archbishop Guerry of Gamarai.

Excerpts from their declaration follow:

“Threats of lay-offs‘ in some
of the industrial enterprises
of our-' region have brought
uneasiness in numerous ‘work-

‘ ers’ homes. A partial’ unem-

ployment already exists in
ma.ny branches of industry.

It is not up to us to appraise
whether these are the signs of
an economic recession nor to
study upon the economic as-
pect of this much too general
phenomena that strikes our
country after others and pre-
cisely one year after the
United States where it is now
beginning to come to an end.

‘But lay-offs and unemploy-

ment set, in everybody’s con-
science, problems of moral and
spiritual ‘order; human and
social problems which we have
the duty to examine in the

_light of the social doctrine of

the church.

A “1) Public opinion. The first
duty of everyone is to take
cognizance of the danger of
moral harm that unemploy-
ment brings in a worker’s
home. We say moral. harm
and not simply an economic
fact as pretended by the the-
ories of some economists who
would not hesitate to -suggest
unemployment as a good solu-

tion and in ‘some ci_rcum-

stances even as beneficial in
order to facilitate a business

-reorganization. . r -

A MORAL HARM

“We do not accept this eco-
nomic materialism that sacri-
fices the workers’ human per-

sonality to monies and profits. _

Unemployment is, above all, a.
moral harm because it ‘strikes,
with its burden of sufferance,
at human beings. in- their
hearts and flesh. The -loss of
a job, the total or partial loss

of wages causes restrictions -

on the essential needs of life,

trouble, responsibilities, his de-
termination to reap from his

work the necessary means for
the livelihood of his loved
ones, his wife and his children.
Therefore, he has the right to
the respect of his dignity first
of all, in establishing working

conditions through collective-

agreements and also in such
other external ‘conditions that
at times may bring about a
break in the existing moral
bond between himself and his
employer.

“Labor will affirm’ and
strengthen its dignity, if and
when, in discussions orother
manifestations, will keep, its

calm and self-possession _ab-,
.. staining from the violence that
endangers the interests of all

concerned. ._
“Finally, for the" Christian,

_unemployment‘ is a moral

wronguib-ec.ause._f..it violates

God’s intention that man must
work and find, in the fruit of
his labor, the means to live a
human life. In a human econ-
omy, in a more just and better.
organized society, there shall
never be a place for unem-
ployment. . -
“2) Management should do
its utmost to avoid great
harm. First of all, in a period
of economic difficulties, lay-
offs should not become the
first solution taken by auto-
matic consideration. This solu-
tion is very easy! On the con-

trary, lay-offs should be con-’

sidered only as a last extreme
resort when all other solutions
have been analyzed conscien-
tiously according to, the de-
mands of justice, equity -and

charity and after all legal

measures -pertaining to unem-

-ployment have been loyally

considered and met. Moreover,

if sacrifices are needed, the_

first to be sacrificed should
not be vital wages. In a human
economy remuneration of cap-
ital comes after the remunera-
tion of labor. (It is especially
proper to guarantee the low-
est paid, hours of work that

. will assure a respectable stand--

ard of living. Finally, without

waiting for eventual signs of

recession, it is the duty of the
employer to -be prepared for

-the future: - modernizing ma-

chinery in proper time, finding
new markets’ and developing
exports. »

“3),' Above and beyond the

enterprise. Gone are thedays '

when an enterprise could shut

’ itself off in isolation’. The de-
cision taken by one, in a pe-'

riod of recession, risks to have
its repercussions on the others
and particularly on those of a
complementary nature.

“It is, therefore, necessary
to learn a lesson from the sim-
ple outlook of an economic
recession, which even if it does
not_happen, should be quickly

, doomed.”

PHENOMENAI. UPSURGE in output per man-hour since 1956 in -‘nonferrous mining, smelting, and refining is
shown in‘ top chart above- More than half of the._l.l-year productivity gain (1947-1958) took place in the
last two" years; iust over. 25 per cent in primary- smelting an=dl“refining occurred over the same period. In
the lower chart are shown the average annual productivity percentage increases. The chart compares aver-
age yearly increase in output per man-hourin’ All.'U.S.'industry, combined, with maior branches of nonfer-
rous industry. All branches of nonferrous had gains well above the national "average gain in productivity.

ductivity in‘ copper, for ex-
ample, can show the quantity
of ore, or the quantity of
metal, produced per man per
hour. ‘

Ordinarily, changes ‘in out-
put per workers are measured
by comparing the output for
a given period of time with
output for some other period
of time. As_ an example, the
average copper mine’ worker
produced 28 pounds of copper
per hour in 1947, and increased
his production to nearly 39
pounds per hour in 1958. Fre-
quently, a productivity “index”
is used to measure output
changes (see top chart on this
page). A “base” year is select-
ed and other years are com-
pared with the base year, for
which 100 is designated as the
For example,
lead-zinc mining output was
“l00’ in 1947.‘ This brings the
output figure for 1958 up to
135.8. This means that U. S.
lead-zinc mine workers pro-
duced 35 8/10 per cent more
metal per hour last year than
in 1947—only slightly under
36 per cent, in other words.

2. How does the increase in
nonferrous productivity com-
pare with productivity in oth-
or industries?

Every branch of nonferrous
metals has registered’ greater
than average gains in output-
per-man since 1947. All non-
agricultural industries in the
United States show an aver-
age annual increase in produc-
tivit'y from 1947 through 1948
——-11 years in all—of 2.2 per
cent. This compares with the
average annual increase in the
recoverable metal output in
copper mining of 3.1 per cent
and in copper ore mined of 4.4
per cent. The average yearly
increase in primary, smelting
and refining of copper, lead,
and zinc was 4.7 per cent, and
the brass mills showed 2.7 per
cent.

Employers in our industry
haVe.been quick to take ad-
vantage of every cost-cutting,
labor-saving development that
has come along, as the above

figures show. The union, obvi- _

 

ously, must be just“as'alert in
seeingto it that‘ the 'workers
in the industry get’th’ei'r"s‘ha’re
of the gains ‘aris~in—‘g from
lower-cost production?‘

Productivity’ gains jiih, -mt

ferrous metals have 'b’e’_'e‘n' es-

pecially large in recent"y‘ears.“
S i n c e 1956, these  in_crea’ses '

have been much larger‘‘’ ’-"than
the national industrial average,
much greater than in‘ other
important industries. “‘  ' ‘

If 1947_ is given the ,‘fba_se,”
index figure of 100, as We men-
tioned earlier, it will be_ seen
that productivity of bituminous
coal, for example, had an index
figure of 164.3 in 1956 and 178.3
in 1958, or a percentage
increase of 8% per cent in the
period from 1956 through 1958.
Productivity of useable i r o n
ore actually went down nearly?

11 per cent in the ‘-same 11956-.

ductivity. Brass mill produc-
tivity was up 2.3 per cent in
the 1956-58 period, nearly 9
per cent of the post-war in-
crease. While all this‘ was go-
ring on, the productivity in
basic steel DROPPED a_ shade
less than 3 per cent! ’

- Mine-Mill members laid off-

‘ during*=the metals crisis, will

not be surprised at these fig-
ures. They have hadfirst-hand
experience in the matter of in-
creased productivity over the
past two years. While the av-

erage United States industry

was practically standing still,
all branches of non_ferrous, ex-
cept brass, experienced the
biggest gains in productivity
since World War II. ‘
The brass mills’ productivity
over 1957-58 reflects the-low
level of output in the industry,
when all mills were operating
far below capacity levels. The
same factors at work here
were behind the decline in
steel productivity last year.
In recent months, both‘ steel
and brass productivity have
registered sharp increases.

4. What’s the “moral” of all
these figures?

Simply that these compari-
sons show that ‘our industry
in all branches is far ahead in
productivity gains since our
last contracts were signed in
1956. While the 1956.contracts
provided for annual wage in-
creases, these wage rates have
not kept up with the tremen-
dous gains in productivity~-—in-
creases in output which the
employers have forced from
their smaller work forces.

The “moral” is unmistak-
able: On the basis of the rec-
ord since 1956, Mine-Mill mem-
bers have coming to them a
really substantial wage in-
crease this year, a pay raise
based on productivity.

5. Well, that’s in the past.
What about the future? Will
there be further gains in pro-
ductivity this year?

rugged speedup campaign

lowered demand and produc-
tion. These had an immediate
effect on productivity, which .
will continue to show sharp 
gains with increased output in M

6. What about being more , ,
specific on productivity in-_ 
creases in the various branoh- '
es of nonferrous? Let’s go
down the line, starting with 
copper mining. . ' . ‘ - 

COPPER MINING -—.-Since».
1956, when present Mine-Mill 
contracts in copper were,’
signed, mine output of recover»
able copper per man-hpourhas
gone up by almost 20.per
cent—from about 32% pounds
to nearly 39 pounds per man- -,
hour. Output of copper ore per ’ 4 ,.
man-hour went up about 16 per . 
cent. Almost three-fifths.:of the ’
increase in productivity. over i
the 11 years since 1947 has" 
taken place in the last two
years. This tremendous tWo-  at
year jump has sharply 113- 
duced the labor cost per pound  V _
of copper mined. It Went down 
121/2 per cent in two years?’
and took place despite'the‘au- - ,.
tomatic wage increases ._
1957 and 1958. Although 5-the ‘T 5
drop in labor cost per pound—'j— '-
9/10 of a cent—looks small, in_  ‘
1958 alone, the copper com--;
panies ’ were able to --parlafy
this into a saving of nearly “
$18 million. ‘

  Television

Censorship Often

Becomes Prett Ridi lo  s  
0 . ABOOS about what can and cannot be said on television are many and varied. Oft-
qentimes they are downright ridiculous. Always they are dictated by concern of
the sponsor for his product which, after all, most TV shows are produced to sell.
Not so long ago one of the better writers of live TV drama, Rod Serling, com-
plained about these restrictions on the author’s freedom of expression.‘ He mentioned

such subject ' matter as lynching of Ne-
groes, for example, which might offend
the delicate sensibilitigs of the sponsor’s cus-
tomers below the Mason-Dixon line. That kind
of stuff often was blue-penciled in the script
before it ever got near the production stage.
There has been talk about more picayune
taboos imposed by the sponsor, to the extent
even of the blue-penciling of the line of dia-
~“r«~ logue from a script: “Give me a match”——
chopped because the sponsor sold cigarette
lighters. The line had to be changed to: “Give
me a light.”
* ‘Ir *

A I MUCH more glaring and pointed example ~

, of that kind of censorship left millions of
TV viewers puzzled during the recent Play-
house 90 production of “Judgment at Nurem-

- berg,” reviewed by this column in the last
issue of the Mine-Mill Union. At one point, near
the close of the drama, Claude Rains, playing

the part of the American judge heading the
tribunal which found Nazi Germany’s four top

1. judges. guilty of hideous war crimes, was dis-

cussing these crimes with an aide when the
sound track went dead for several seconds.

 Like us, probably most viewers watching
-  the show assumed that the cut-out of Rains’
__._',',~l..voice, even though his lips kept moving, was
caused by some technical failure in transmis-
sion, common enough on TV. Later disclosures
. showed it wasn’t.
 It seems that Rains was referring specifi-
 . rally to.-the mass extermination by the Nazis of
- 0 innocent. women and children in gas ovens.‘
Evidently having slipped by the script censor,
7 the reference was cut out of the sound track
on the; ‘insistence of the sponsor at the‘last
minute, whilethe show was on the air.

L, The sponsor was the American Gas asso-
ciation.
‘thought thereference to the use of gas, ovens
by the Nazis to exterminate people reflected

w unfavorably on their product.

, _ Something akin to thiskind of control by
A  sponsors,“ not only over script content but tal-
igenti’-as‘we‘ll, was demonstrated even more re-
. , ; cently: in another way. The panel show “Keep
 F ’Talking”=w'as bought by a new sponsor for an-

Labor Opposition Grows oUnion ‘Ref

WASHINGTON, D. C.——SeV-

4 eral. other powerful voices in

the labor movement were add-
ed last month to that of Mine-

‘Mill President John Clark in

declaring ‘outright opposition _

i to ' the Kennedy-Ervin “labor

reform” bill.

By month’s end the chorus
of broadsides appeared to have
oved’ the top leadership of

 I AFL-CIO, which supported

 bill in the Senate, to take
another soul-searching look at
the measure as it was being

_ readied for action in the House.
On May 20 the AFL-CIO Ex-

ecutive council announced ’a
new position, terming the bill
unacceptable.

Atleast a month earlier, as
reported in the May issue of
the ]M;i.ne-Mill? ‘Union, President
Clark, quoting Mine-Mill’s con-

1 vention resolution,,.urged, that

all jlocals contact their con-

. gressmen "to ‘vote against’ the

bill because, “despite a Demo-
cratic majority, a so-called

,-mild labor bill cannot get by

Congress.” He. also assailed

,nies are sharing in the boom of steep profit increases over the first three months of

Furthermore, according to
nearly all industry observers,
the outlook is for even bigger
profits throughout the rest of
the year as a result of present
high levels of building con-

- struction, expanded auto pro-

duction and improved demand
for non-ferrous metals coming
from many consuming indus-
tries.

So rosy, in fact, is the pic-
ture that profits might well
climb to the 'pre-recession
boomtime levels of 1955 and
1956 when the copper compa-
nies, enjoyed the m-ost profit-
able years of their history.
REASONS

The. union’s Research de-

partment bulletin is .full of ,
facts and figures-showing that

these sharp -profit ‘gains-'.ar‘e
being made by the companies
through higher sales ‘volume,

. higher -prices and lower costs
arising out of increases in pro- 5

ductivity. (See story page 5.)
“The gains,” as pointed out

by the Research .Report, .“are;

not limited solely to the cop-
per section of the industry,
price increases
higher. The ability of many
lead and zinc_ companies to
raise their earnings, with only
relatively small price increases
for their products, is an indi-
cation of the extent to, which
they have been able to exploit
the greater productivity of
their labor force.” ‘
Anaconda’s after-tax profits

"for the first "three months "of

1959 were $16,250,000 as com-
pared with $6,131,000 for the
same period last year, an in-
crease of 165 per cent. Its sub-
sidiary, Inspiration, up p e d
profits by 315.9 per cent, from
$340,000 in 1958- to $1,414,000
in 1959. 9

l Here are some others '. . . .
Kennecott: from $11,652,000 to
$22,396,000 —— a 92.2 per cent

invasion of government on the

internal affairs of labor. Also-

sharply attacked were the ma-
neuvers of the AFL-CIO in
helping shepherd the bill
through the Senate. '

The statements were issued
by Joseph Curran, president
of the National Maritime lun-
ion and a vice president of

the AFL-CIO; John L. Lewis," A

president of the United Mine
Workers; and James R. Hoffa,
president of the
member Teamsters union.
Curran blasted the bill in a
signed front-page editorial in
the AFL-CIO seamen’s union
newspaper, The Pilot. He said

the measure was the result of’
cold hatred”.

“hysteria and
against labor.

HATRED

“This is a bill,” Curran de-'

clared, “conceived in‘ haste,

based on hatred and being

fanned by the enemies of la-
bor to destroy the legitimate
labor movement.” Takin g

ficers on the AFL-CIO Ex-
ecutive council, the NMU lead-
er said: 5

“It is a fact that the ‘labor

out of $450,000 through an embezzlement scheme. Nor has
anybody proposed to shut down industry because the New

the cost of crime in 1958 at a staggering $20 billion—-more

 Whaf Ofher Labor
  Unions Are Domg
 Packinghouse Workers

Last month the AFL-CIO United Packinghouse Workers of
America negotiated a historic advance toward ultimate elimina-
tion of the north-south wage differential that has always ex-
isted in sugar refineries. New three-year UPWA agreements
covering about 2,000 American Sugar refinery workers in New
Orleans and Baltimore will reduce the wage differential to
only 13 cents an hour by February of 1961. Only four years
ago the base pay of southern workers in that industry was 41
cents an hour below northern rates. I _

‘ But that wasn’t the news about the Packinghouse Workers
 which made the headlines in the daily press last month. Sen-
sationalized instead was testimony by a_ parade of informer
witnesses before the House Un-American Activities committee
‘7‘“'in Chicago, center of the meat packing industry and. headquar-
ters of the Packinghouse union. The UPWA, said the witnesses,
is “saturated,” “infested” and “infiltrated” with Communists.
They named a number of present, and former leaders of the
union as “reds.” The charges were denied both by the UPWA

and the individuals accused. , -

Making the accusations were: an organizer for the AFL-
CIO Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butcher Workers Union, rival

" of the UPWA in the packing industry; a former member of the
UPWA revealed as an FBI informer for the last 15 years; and
a disgruntled former UPWA vice president who had lost the
support of the membership. Significantly enough, the Un-Ameri-
can committee hearings coincided with the opening of negotia-
tionsby the UPWA with the packing industry.

it 0 Chemical Workers

The long-anticipatedmerger of the International Chemical
Workers with the Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers fell through
last month. Main point of disagreement was over the question
of continued paid jobs ‘for ICW executive board members. Other
issues stalemated the merger talks, too, such as lack of rank
and file democracy in the ICW.

The merger was supposed to be consummated at the 1959
conventions of both AFL-CIO unions scheduled to run simul-
taneously next October in Cleveland. It would have joined about
80,000 ICVV members with more than 200,000 members of the
Oil Workers union. Abandonment of the merger plan was an-
nounced May 13 following a meeting of top officials of the two
unions in Chicago.

The OCAW’s executive board consists of rank and file
members elected out of districts representing geographical sec-

‘*" tions of the country. The ICW’s executiveeboard is elected at
national conventions, is made up of officers at large, and does
not represent ‘members according to geographical districts.

Here's Used Car
Points to Check

F, AFTER the on-the-lot tests, a car still
looks good to you, it is time to drive it on
the road. If the dealer won’t allow this, even

.provided ,a salesman goes along, take leave of

him. If any cash deposit is required, make sure
it will be returned to you if you reject the car,
not as a credit on some other car off the sam
dealer's lot. - '
As you drive, keep your ears open for se-
rious-sounding knocks, rattles and squeaks. As
one engineer said “Every rattle is a defect re-

port.”. Reject the car if there are too many to '

put up with.

L. Make several starts from rest. The clutch
should engage smoothly, both forward and in
reverse, Without jerking, grabbing or chatter,
which indicate need for adjustment or replace-
ment of parts. The same goes for starting a
car with automatic transmission. '

2, When you have the car rolling, speed up
several times from 10 to 40 mph in high gear
or Drive Range. The acceleration should be
smooth—no engine hesitation or bucking. With
automatic transmission, look for smooth, evenly-
sp'ace‘d"'shifts, no engine “break away” or rac-
ing; anything else signals the need for adjust-
ment or repairs.

3.._DriVe around sharp corners, both left and
right. -There should be no excessive play or
binding in the steering. The former can indi-
Cate worn parts, the latter a worn and prob-
ably-overtightened steering gear.

, 4.: a_ straight uncrowded road, with no

wind, ‘set the car on a straight course and relax
your hold of the steering wheel. A tendency of
the car to pull or drift consistently to either
side usually means that the front suspension is
out of adjustment or out of line.

5,. On a broad road with a uniform surface,
make sure there’s no following traffic, and stop
several times from a moderate speed, braking
hardereach time. Stops should be smooth and
straight, with no swerving, grab or chatter-
any of which may only be cured by adjustment,
new linings, or refacing or even replacement
of brake" drums. The_ brake pedal should re-
main __well clear of the floor. '

6.7. -’Drive down as long a hill as you can find,
with your’ foot off the accelerator. (If in flat
terrain, decelerate from 50 to about 10 mph
without using the brakes.) Then tramp on the
accelerator. and look behind for a puff or cloud
of blue smoke, an almost certain indication that
piston rings soon will need. replacing.

1,. 'It will need only a_ short ride over a really
rough road—p’erferably a curving one——to show
up rattles and squeaks which will need atten-
tion. Check, too, for jerky or uncertain steer-
ing and a front end which feels loose. Reno-
vating thc latter is costly.

8-. Centre yourself directly behind the car
and watch it as someone else drives away from
you slowly down a straight, uncrowded road.
If the-car travels a little crab-wise or at a slight
angle from straight-ahead, accident damage,
including a bent frame, may be the cause,
Check also for wh eels that are bent and
wobbly.

9. If possible, drive the car long enough to
tell if it is going to overheat. A slow pull up
a long steep hill, or a heavy dose of slow traf-
fic, is likely to show up_ this fault, though the
test is more apt to be successful on a hot day,
of course. If overheating can be tracedrto the
radiator, bear in mind that the cost of a new
one  substantial. ‘ -

N 1958, paralytic polio crippled or killed? 
per cent more people in the United States
than it did in 1957. In the first eight weeks of-'

balance was the basic 6 problem "A
in the lead-zinc World.‘ The

U. S. . delegation’s conclusion,

it" was pointed’ out by the 1
' -union” 'sp'okesme‘n', coincides’

exactly with what Mine-Mill
has been asserting, as it has
been fighting over the past
two years for effective relief

‘for the domestic lead-zinc in-

dustry. The union fight has
been waged‘ before Congres-

- sional committees, the United

States Tariff commission, and
in direct appeals to President
Eisenhower. ~

‘Larson and Pezzati explained

the union’s efforts to win_
backthe jobs lost by the shut- M

downs of lead and zinc mines
throughout the country. ‘
Chairman Nichols said that
even under the quota limita-
tions imposed by "the Presi-
dent, theytonnages of lead and
zinc admissable are generous
in relationship to present or

anticipated demand. Nichols

told the union leaders:

“The United‘ States ‘con-
tinues to look at the lead and
zinc situation as a world
problem. Our own mines have
made a. valiant effort to ad-
just output and demand.” '

He indicated that steps an-
nouncedlby other countries to
adjust production were a step
in the right direction, but
might not be sufficient to cope
with the world market prob-
lem. '

DISCUSS CUTS

The government and Mine-
Mill conferees exchanged
views on the reductions in
world 1ead..and zinc produc-
tion announced early -in May

by the UN committee- The-

committee; estimated that with
these production’ cuts, world
surpluses of primary smelter
production. would be -reduced
in 1959 as compared with
earlier years. The UN ' com-
mittee"s estimates of world
surpluses: » (._in~ metric tons of

place major emphasis on im-
proved coordination of 1959
collective bargaining with the
Anaconda company. -

The meeting of the National
Anaconda conference was the
most representative and best-
attended since the group was
formally organized in 1952.
Local unions represented have
collective b a r g ainin g agree-

trade, an end to the cold war,
and a call to the Democrats to
honor all campaign promises
of last November were the
chief topics of resolutions
adopted Sunday, .May B4, at
the annual convention of Chi-
cago Amalgamated Local
Union No. 758.

More than 60 delegates, rep-
resenting 11 shop units, at-
tended the, convention. Dele-
gates from each unit reported
on shop conditions, bargaining
demands, grievances, and oth-
er activities.

SPEAKERS

B 0 a r d Member Raymond
Dennis of District 3 addressed
the convention on the need for
adequate preparations for this
year's bargaining. Bernard W.
Stern, Mine-Mill research di-
rector, discussed the economic
situation as it bears on nego-
tiations.

David Rothstein, Local 758
counsel, spoke on current la-
bor legislation before Con-
Business Manager

a new car, His wife works! " James Pinta summarized dis-

cussion on shop conditions.

‘President Robert Bey pre-
sided at the convention.

A highlight of the meeting
was a report by Miss Elaine
Filipak, daughter of a Local
758 member, on her participa-
tion in the Youth March to
Washington. Her trip was fi-
nanced by the local.

A luncheon prepared by
women members and wives of
the delegates was served.
LABOR UNITY

On the question of labor
unity, the convention declared
that “all organized labor is
under attack by the McClel-
lan committee, which is pav-
ing the Way for anti-labor leg-
islation.”

‘Employers and the news-
papers, the delegates said,

“are carrying on a campaign_

against any more gains for
union members, under the
smokescreen of a campaign
against inflation.”

In the face of this, the con-
vention pointed out, “the labor
movement is weakened by lack
of unity, leaving it subject to
attacks instead of being strong

enough to demand and get bet-
ter labor legislation: the labor
leaders who keep labor divided
are misrepresenting the" inter-
ests of their members, who
recognize that all union men
and women should stick to
gether for the good of all.”

As for L o c al 758, the dele-
gates said, it “shall take every
opportunity to help the mem-
bers of other unions in their
organizing, negotiating, strikes
or any other legitimate union
activities.”

California State Senate

'7 SACRAMENTO, Calif.—-_A senate committee, by a four to

’ a’s big corporate farmers.

California presently has a minimum wage law only for

 A  The bill, which had already passed the lower house, set a

cent floor for farm workers.

i,.;Two Democrats on the Labor Committee, including

publican members to refer the bill to an interim study com-

upport of one of labor’s ma-

Organized business, how-

yffin. opposition to any in-
freasegin the minimum wage
"r”_expansion of the Act’s pro-
ections to additional workers.
1 The main bill under consid-
ration is the Kennedy-Morse-
Roosevelt bill. Endorsed by
Mine-Mill and labor generally,
, is bill would boost the mini-
 wage to $1.25 per hour
 would‘ extend coverage of
h.ei,Fair Labor Standards Act
 approximately 7.8 million
additional workers, chiefly in
the, retail and service trades.
MEANY TESTIFIES ,
-. Inopening the case for this
ill, AFL-CIO President George

Meany said it would “under-
gird the economy, improve
purchasing power and would
strengthen the entire struc-
ture” of free enterprise. At
the same time, he cited family
budget studies to show that
even $1.25 an hour was barely
enough to cover a single per-
son's needs.

Meany was followed by a
series of leaders from various
unions, including the Retail
Clerks, Wholesale and Depart-
ment Store, Clothing Workers,
and others, who, in addition to
endorsing the bill as a whole,
used conditions in their partic-
ular industries to justify favor-
able action. A

Many other unions will help
round out the record before
the hearing is concluded.

Speaking for the Citizens
Committee on the Fair Labor
Standards Act, the Very Rev.
Francis B. Sayre declared the

only merited criticism of. the
Kennedy-Morse bill was that it
did not raise the minimum

wage high enough. Sayrealso *

said that wage workers in
farming should be brought un-
der the Act.

a higher minimum wage and
extension of coverage would

“Comparatively few work-

“Therefore, they are in a’

Business spokesmen predict-
ed dire things if the bill should
be enacted. The US ‘Chamber
of‘ Commerce claimed exten-
sion of coverage to retail and
service workers would force
layoffs or price increases—or
both—since these trades could
not absorb the higher wage
boost.

Other opposition testimony

, came from the National Auto.

mobile Dealers Association,
the American Retail Federa-
tion, National Retail Furniture
National Retail
Farm Equipment Association,
and the Associated Retail Bak-
ers of America.

The Administration, which
has not yet offered testimony,
is expected to seek a bare-
bones compromise. President
Eisenhower, in his Jan. 20 Eco-
nomic Report, requested a lim-
ited extension of minimum
wage coverage but did not ask
for an increase in the mini-

, mum hourly rate of pay.

Union Told if  2
U. S. Won’t     

Sell Copper

DEN VER——Direct assurances

- that the government does not

now contemplate the unload-
ing of national stockpiled cop-
per on the open market were

received last month by the In-.

ternational Union of Mine,
Mill and Smelter Workers.

Declarations to that effect
were contained in letters to
Mine-Mill President John Clark
from James P. Mitchell, Sec-
retary of Labor; Leo A. Hoegh,
director of the Office of Civil

and D e r e n s e Mobilization,  "
. which is in charge of the gov-
- ernment stockpile, and Carl F.

Oechsle, Assistant Secretary of

. Commerce.

REPLY TO WIRES

The messages were all in
reply to telegrams from the

— union’s four top officers as-

sailing any move by the gov-
ernment to release copper
from the national stockpile at

S a time when industry-wide ne-

gotiations between the Mine-
Mill union and major copper
producers are about to start.
Acknowledging receipt of
the union’s protest, OCDM Di-
rector Hoegh advised Clark

that “we have no plans to dis- P

pose of copper at this time.”

Labor Secretary M i t c h ell J
said: “I know that the .Admin- i

istration has no plans to dis-
pose of copper from the De-
fense Production act inventory
at this time.”

Assistant Commerce Secre-
tary Oechsle said: “It is our
understanding that plans to
make disposition of surplus
copper have been shelved.” ‘

PROTEST

The union’s protest to Presi-
dent Eisenhower and cabinet
members was triggered by
earlier reports that the OCDM
was considering the sale of
substantial quantities of stock-
piled copper on the open mar»
ket. ~

President Eisenhower was.

requested by the union to
“make it abundantly plain that
it is not the policy of the gov-
ernment to engage in com-
modity transactions so as to
benefit either side at the bar-
gaining table.” '

Lending additional strength
to the Mine-Mill position was
the recent action of the U. S.-
Senate which passed a reso-
lution sponsored by Western
senators expressing the Sen-
ate’s opposition to the dump-
ing of government stockpiled
copper.

Raiders Are Defeate

(Continued from Front Page)

American Smelting and Re-
finery workers at the El Paso
smelter voted on May 11, giv-
ing Mine-Mill 334 votes to
Steel’s 182. Two workers voted
for neither.

DISRUPTED

In both Butte and El_Paso,
Mine-Mill local unions were
preparing to enter collective
bargaining with the companies
when the raiders struck. It
had taken Steel more than a
decade to learn that their an-
cient slanders of “commu-
nism” had not weakened the
unity of Mine-Mill’s member-
ship. This time, the Steel-
worker payrollers tried “pork
chops” and went down to de-

feat promising Mine-Mill mem-.

bers wages and conditions
which David McDonald and
his machine never have been
able to win even for workers
in the steel industry.

The Steel union, led by an
old enemy of the Butte min-
ers, Jim Hartzell, came close
to not getting an election» at
all. When Steel petitioned, the
NLRB held the raiders had not
filed sufficient valid cards.

Many cards had been present- .

ed bearing signatures of men
who were not even Anaconda
employees. Steel withdrew its
petition. This left Chemical

‘out on a limb. That union had

“intervened” and if the orig-
inal petition was invalid the
Chemical intervention was too.

vThe Chemical group, led by
Homer Wilson, who betrayed’

Mine-Mill years ago and still
is trying to deliver for the
union specifically chartered in
the old days to raid CIO,
rushed to Steel’s aid. Chemical
union supporters signed Steel
cards to help get the election
held.

Led by International Presi-
dent John -Clark, Board Mem-
ber Ernest Salvas, and a broad
Local 1 committee, Mine-Mill’s
campaign blasted the raiders’
obvious “con-man” promises of
pie-in-the-sky and, in an area
hard-hit by unemployment,
demonstrated that Mine-Mill
was the only union which had
been carrying on a crusade in
Washington to save the jobs
of hard-rock miners. In addi-
tion, the refusal of Butte min-
ers to isolate themselves from
the rest of the Mine-Mill Ana-
concla council played an im-

portant part in the Steel de-V
feat. Chemical’s campaign-r con-’ —
