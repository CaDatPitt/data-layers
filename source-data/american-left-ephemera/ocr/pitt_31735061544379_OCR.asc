roa A socmusr AMERICA

The Socialist Party of the United States
pledges itself anew to the task of building a

 

Socialist society, in which the industries of-

the country shall be socially‘ owned and
democratically managed for the common
good; a society in which security, plenty,
peace and freedom shall be the heritage of
all.

Eight years ago the people of this coun-
try voted to continue.the “Old Deal” of the
Republican party. The attempt of the “Old
Deal” to preserve the rights of the few who
own most of the national wealth plunged the
nation into the worst depression in our
history. ’

Four years ago the majority of the voters
of the United States threw their support to
the “New Deal” of the Democratic party.
Under it, big business was given almost
unheard-of powers. Untold wealth was des-
troyed. Prices rose. Profits advanced. VVages
lagged. Twelve million men and_ women are
still jobless. Hunger and destitution stalk
throughout the land.

The “New Deal,” like the “Old Deal,” has
failed. ,

Under the “New Deal,” more vicious at-
tacks have been made on our civil liberties
than at any period since the days immediately
following the \Vorld VVar. Gag and “lo_valty”
bills have been rushed through our legisla-
tures. Union organizers have been seized,
kidnapped and killed. The militia has been
used to crush attempts of labor to organize,
Lynching. race discrimination and the use of
violence have continued unabated. Against
these infringements of human rights the

_ Democratic party administration has kept

an ominous silence as did the Republican ad-
ministration before it.

WORKERS EXPLOITED

Under both the “Old Deal”.and the “New
Deal,” America has drifted toward insecurity
and war—the logical results of capitalism.
For ._under capitalism, the many live by
working in the city and on the land. The
few who own the means of production and
distribution employ the workers only if they
can extract a profit fromt their labor. \Vith
their scarcity wages. the workers are able to
buy only a part of the goods which they pro-
duce. Goods pile up. factories close. The
country is plunged intofxanother depression.
The capitalists attempt towkeep up their pro-

 

fits during the depression. Workers are dis-
missed. Hours are lengthened; Wages are
slashed. The workers are compelled, in or-
der to save themselves from utter poverty,
to make demands upon the government for
appropriations for relief and public jobs. and

upon industry for wages adequate to main-

tain their standard of living. These demands
are resisted by the properties’class—fearful
of parting with a share of their unearned
wealth. _

The need and the demand for greater
appropriations and higher wages increase.
The strugglepbetween the House of Have
and the House of Vl/ant becomes ever more
intense. In" order to render the masses
powerless, big business seeks to deny them
their constitutional rights. Fascist trends
develop—trends that only a powerful and
militant labor movement on the economic
and political field can successfully stay.

War, under a declining capitalism, be-I

comes an ever greater menace. The owners
look toward imperialist conquest, of back_—
ward nations as a means of diverting at-
tention from unrest at home, and of ‘gaining

new”markets, new investment areas, new -

sources of raw material. This has already
caused us; to increase our military expenditure
to three times as greatas before the World
W'ar, and if unchecked can have but one
ending—an international war. _

In Socialism -alonedo we find the solu-
tion of our problem. ;Under Socialism. in-
dustry would be socially owned and demo-
cratically administered by workers, consumers

and technicians. The workers would no longer

be forced to pay tI'iblite‘.t0 private owners
and their political lackeys. The workers
would be able to buyiback the goods they
create. Industry, finding a market, for these
goods, would run without periodic break-
downs. Unemployment,-and the wastes of
unplanned industry would cease. Every use-
ful worker would be assured of high living

standards; short hours, freedom and liberty

and a chance to enjoy a good life. Industrial
autocracy and war would pass- An economy
of scarcity would giveiiway to ‘an economy
of abundance. '

SECURITY ROSSIBLE
. On the basis of the present capacity to
produce, a‘ socialized’ society will make it
possible to
T 1. More than doulJ1e..: the pre-sent. annual

' production of wealth which properly
distributed would provide every—
family [with a minimum income of
$2,500 to $4.000 per year.

2. Guarantee jobs to all persons willing
to work and at the same time reduce
the hours of labor to 30 or less per
week.

3. Guarantee security for all persons
against old age. sickness and accident.

4. Provide a fine, modern home for every
family in the city or ,on the farm._

Such a society cannot be obtained with-'

out a mighty struggle. The struggle must
be waged by both workers and farmers-
organized into labor and farmer unions, co-
operatives, and their own political party.

WE PROPOSE .  .

To improve the conditions of life and
labor and thereby to weld together the
strength and solidarity of the masses, the
Socialist party pledges itself to fight for the
following immediate steps:

1. Constitution

VVe propose to amend the Constitution
to fitour needs through the Farmers’ and
Workers’ Rights Amendment, ending the
usurped power of the Supreme Court to
declare social legislation unconstitutional and
reaffirming the right‘ of Congress toacquire
and operate industries. \Ve also propose to

change the .Constitution to make future
amendments less difficult. \Ve pledge con- ’

tinued support of the Child Labor Amend-i
ment. ~ - 7

2. Social Ownership

We propose the social ownership and
democratic controlof the banks, mines, rail-
roads, the power industry, and all key in-
dustries. -

3. 1 Relief and Social Security
\Ve propose an immediate appopriation

by Congress of funds to insure adequate

Federal relief to the unemployed, and a com-
prehensive prngram of useful public works
at,unirm wages. especially the immediate

launching of a public housing program for v

the complete elimination of the‘ nation's
slums; and a Federal system -of unemploy—‘

ment insurance and adequate old age pen-t

sions as provided in the Fra7.ier—l.undeen
bill, and disability and maternity insurance.

4. Youth

We propose the passage of the American
Youth Act to meet the immediate educa-
tional and economic needs of young people;
adequate Federal appropriations for public
schools and free city colleges with a view to
making possible a full education for all young
people. We oppose the C.C.C., the National
Youth Administration and other govern-
mental agencies dealing with the youth prob-
lem which threaten the wage and living
standards of organized labor.

5. Labor Legislation

VVe propose the establishment of the
thirty-hour week; the guarantee of the right
of collective bargaining by all workers in in-
dustries and occupations—public and private;

_the abolition of injunctions in labor disputes;

the prohibition of company unions, company
spying. and private guards and gunmen; the
prohibition of the use of the police, deputy
sheriffs, militia and Federal troops against
labor.

6. Taxation

\Ve propose a drastic increase in income
and inheritance taxes and the introduction of
the capital levy, together with a land value
tax looking toward elimination of the un-
earned increment of land values.

7. Agriculture
\Ve propose :

A. That immediate relief be provided for
debt-laden working farmers by ad-
vancing government credit on such
terms as do not threaten the farmer
with the loss of his farm.

B. That farm prices be stahilizedvat cost
of production to the working farmer,
such stabilization to be made by rep-
resentatives of organized working
farmers and consumers.

C. That the marketing, processing and
distibution of farm porducts be taken
over by bona fide cooperatives and
other agencies to be created for this
purpose.

D. That social insurance be provided
against crop failures. - '

E. That tenant and corporation farming
be abolished by the establishment of
a use-and-occupancy title for family-
sized farms and the conversion of
plantation and corporation farms into
cooperative farms.

8. Civil {Liberties

\Ve propose the abolition of all laws that
interfere with the right of free speech,‘ free
press, free assembly and the activities of
labor in its struggle for organization and
power; the enforcement ' of constitutional
guarantees of economic, political, and social
equality for _the Negro and all other op-
pressed minorities; and the enactment and
enforcement of a Federal anti-lyncliing law.

9. Militarisim and War

Not a penny, not a man to the military
arms of the government. -\Ve reaffirm the
historic position of the Socialist Party of
the United States of opposition to any’ war
in which the government engages. \Ve pro-
pose the elimination of military training from
our schools; the abandonment of imperialist
adventures of a military or economic nature
abroad; the maintenance of friendly relations
with Soviet Russia; the development of'in-
ternationalism among the peoples of the
world; the elimination of profits from war
and war preparations; and the strengthening
of neutrality laws, togthe end that we may
avert immediate warsiwhile fighting for the
attainment of a social order which will
eliminate the basic causes of war.

A CALL 170 ACTION .

The Socialist party calls upon the work-
ers, farmers and all advocates of social justice
to join with it in its T‘struggle to widen the
channels through which “peaceful, orderly
and democratic progrfess may be made; to
resist all trends toward insecurity. fascism
and war; to strengthen labor in its battles
for better conditionls and for increased
power: to refuse to ‘support the parties of
capitalism, or any of; their candidates, and
to unite in the histotic struggle toward a
cooperative world. i
