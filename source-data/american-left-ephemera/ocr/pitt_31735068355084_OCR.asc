to defraud the government by filing false non-communist affidavits with the National
Labor Relations Board. The six found “guilty” will appeal.    . ;  , 

Convicted in the four-week trial in U. S. District Court in Denver were * Interna-
tional President A. C. Skinner, Secretary -Treasurer Irving Dichter, Administrative
Assistant Harold Sanderson, District 4 Boa rd Member Raymond Dennis, International
Rep. Charles H. Wilson, and former Secret ary-Treasurer Maurice E. Travis.

The six-man, six-woman jury
took the case at 6:30 p.m., Sept.
19, and returned its verdict at
4:00 p.m., Sept. 20.

Attorney Telford Taylor, who
was associated with Nathan
Witt and George Francis as de-
fense counsel, made the final
summation to the jury" Sept. 19.

. (See page 3.) Taylor exposed
the failure of the government
to prove a conspiracy, chal-
.lenged the contradictory. testi-
mony of government witnesses,
and described the democratic

. character of Mine-Mill as shown
by the evidence.

Taylor pointed to the evidence
which showed that during the
period. 1947-1949, in any unions
followed a policy of non-compli-
ance with Taft-Hartley and
later decided to comply, as did
Mine-Mill.

In its July meeting the In-’
ternational Executive Board
unanimously expressed its sup-
port forthe “successful defense.
of our brothers who are in-
volved in fighting the false
charges of conspiracy, under a
section of the Taft-Hartley Act
which was repealed four years
ago, in a case which has been
in the courts for seven years.

“We repeat,” said the
-‘Executive B o a r (1 statement,
“what we have declared
throughout those years: the
charges are false, there has
never been any conspiracy, and
we know that ultimately we
will be vindicated.”

The case for the defense was
presented through the testimony
of 15 witnesses:

"Honorary President J o h n

Metcalf-Montoya Safely Bill

The first rumble of public opposition to a federal
mine safety law came in the form of a resolution from
the American Mining Congress convention at Los Angeles

last month.

One delegate to the powerful mine owners’ get-to-

 

{ 4
, ‘A
I.‘

gether rapped Interior Secretary Udal1’s “proposal to

‘broaden mine police powers to include other than coal
properties and to hand the U. S. Bureau of Mines au-

thority to close mines on a moment of suspected trouble.”
In fact, Udall has thus far made no such proposal,
but the delegate was voicing fears that were widespread

at the convention.
Theresolution in opposition to
a federal safety program said it
would “duplicate the activity of
other agencies, reduce the tech-
nical effectiveness of the U. S.
Bureau of» Mines, and lead to
confusion and interference in
inanagement-employee-state co-
operation — something essential

to optimum performance... As-

safety is a continuing daily duty
in operation and planning, the
mining industry —- through its
own endeavors—is best quali-
fied and able to solve its safety
problems. The management of

a mining enterprise cannot
iabrogate its responsibilities in
accident prevention to outside
agencies—government or other-
wise.” , I
Observers at the convention
noted that the mine operators
were particularly concerned by
a provision in the Mine-Mill sup-
-ported Metcalf-Montoya mine

In Birmingham

. _ _. ' 3 ‘International President 1
.HERE have been 41 bombings of Negro homes and business
establishments in Birmingham since January 1, 1963. Not a
single _one'_l_1as been solved ;» there has not been a single‘ conviction.
. The whole country was. shocked at the recent bombing of the
Sixteenth‘ Street Baptist Church in Birmingham which killed four

:little girls” and ‘injured many other Sunday Schoolchildren and
church members. This was followed by the murder of two teen-age

Negro boys and two more bombings. which damaged eight Negro

‘homes.   . ‘

_ So what isthe  "Department of Justice doing aboutit_?

Well, for one tl,1.i,1'1g,,,’,t,1,1_e_ Attorney General announced that a Federal
"Grand‘Jury in Macon,"_Gjeorgia had indicted nine leaders of the L

civil rights d‘movenie'_n‘t in Albany, Georgia.

-" ‘» ~ *.*~* ‘ I .  
HE INDICTMENT involves.-the‘ boycott of a’ grocery’ store
owned by awhite man. The Albany Movement -had been con-

ducting. Va ,_ campaign against, ,.b_usiness_,es.’_which— refused to "hire ‘

l\Iegroes,'a_n_d_this grocery store wasj-tone of
them.’ The owner, however, had be'en’— a juror
on a civil rights case in which the jury had
found in favor of_ the local _she_riff-instead" of
the complaining’ Negro.‘ His business‘ was.
hurt so badly by the boycott that he was
forced to close the store. You guessed it: v .
three of the nine civil rights leaders were
indicted—by the Federal Government—of
“conspiring” to influence and injure a juror.
The other six were indicted for .“perjury.”
Yes, the Justice Department men are
very busy—but not in Birmingham where
murder and. bombings go unsolved and the
Governor and state officials defy the Federal
Government with statements about “no outside interference.”
"It’s the Negro people who have been bombed. It’s the Negro
people who have been murdered—and it's the Negro people who
are arrested. Just a week ago, in Orangeburg, S. C., 177 Negroes
were arrested. Three hundred have been arrested in the last two
weeks in Selma, Alabama. And hundreds more in Georgia, Louisi-
ana and Mississippi for daring to protest against inhuman treat-

* ‘I: *

OW MANY more bombings and how much more bloodshed
will be necessary before the U.‘ S. Department of Justice
takes jurisdiction and responsibility for protecting the Negro peo-
ple in the South? Or has the Justice Department been too busy,
these past several years, trying to prosecute and persecute Jimmy
Hoffa and the Teamsters? Or, for the past 8 years, trying to find
a “conspiracy” that never existed in our own union? Or prose-
cuting divil rights leaders for “conspiracy” to influence and injure

a juror. _ ~
It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that perhaps some people
in this Democratic.administration are a little too concerned about
stepping. on the toes of powerful Democratic politicians from the
South. I’m. talking about Southern Democrats who control most
of the important and powerful committees in Congress. These men

are elected year after year, and thusgain seniority, simply be- S I

cause "the Negro people whom they supposedly represent are de-

lvépriv-ed o_f-zthe»-right.»~to, vote,....These, are the Southern gentlemen,

remember, who‘discourse on “how happy our Nigras were” with
their lot before the _“outside agitators” came in.

, - . ‘k ‘A’ * e i - . . .

HESE ARE'"the Southern gentlemen who believe that, one

hundred years after Emancipation, the Negro people are going
“too; fast” in their drive for emancipation.

You can’t play it both ways. Either you mean what you say
about the rights of minorities and the civil rights of all Americans

—or you don't. If this Administration really wants to provide in -

the South the equal protection of the laws, they can do it. But
they're going to have to step on the toes of some important,South-
ern Democrats. It can’t be done any other way.

Taking on this “controversial” issue of human decency, equal

protection and equal treatment for minorities can be pretty pain‘-_

f_ul-—politically, that is. It’s a lot more fun chasing “Reds” and
“racketeers.” No risks are involved in the political arena-and
it’s a national sport practiced by Democrats and Republicans,
Northerners and Southerners alike for many years.

The Department of Justice, however, has a profound obliga-
tion to seek out and to prosecute with determination—regardless
of political considerations—the bigoted maniacs responsible for
the violence, bombings, and. murder of Negro citizens whether in
Birmingham or Brooklyn. They will certainly have the unqualified

, support ofevery thinking, decent American who feels humiliated;
..as I do, that such violence c'an be wrought against men, women

and children solely because they have‘ a dark skin-—and go for-
ever unpunished in this great country of ours. .

’Two New Contracts

SALTAIR, Utah—Morton Salt
Plant workers of Mine-Mill. Lo-
cal 876, have recently concluded
a three-year agreement with
the company calling for a total
of c 231/2 cents over the next
three years, plus many gains on
non-economic issues.

A new and rather unusual
sick-leave plan provides pay-
ment on December 20 of a giv-
en year for all unused accumu-
lated sick leave. This sick-leave
plan was also negotiated with
the Leslie Salt Co.

In the past the company had
the sole right to designate a
temporary supervisor ( I e a d -
in an) for any job for any peri-
od of time. A new provision
states that any temporary su-
pervisor or leadman jobs will
be posted in accordance with
the ‘posting provision of the con-
‘tract. Strict plant seniority for
ﬁlling of all vacancies will now
prevail.

The new contract also pro-

vides that the company shall
furnish hot meals to all em-
ployees held on o v e r t i m e,
whether or not the employee
was notified in advance.
- _The economic package is as
"follows: First year, 5 cents on
wages, 3 cents on sick leave,
quarter cent increment, half
cent on vacations, and 2 cents
on health and welfare. Second
year, 4 cents on wages, quarter
cent increment, one additional
cent on sick leave. Third year,
five cents on wages, otherwise
same as second year.

G ains registered but not
chargeable to the package in-
-clude a 9 cent increase in wom-

V .'en’s wages in 1964.

Members of the negotiating
committee were C 1 a u d e H.
Parkinson, Pres., LeRoy Davis,
Roy F. Peterson and Donald E.
Maxwell. The committee was
assisted by International Rep.
G. L. Buckner and Board Mem-

"p ber Verne Curtis.

Leslie Pact

SALTAIR, Utah——Agreement
was reached September 26 be-
tween Local 876 and the Leslie
Salt Co. for a three-year, 241/2
cent contract including 17 cents
in wages. -

The only change in the non-
economic portion of the con-
tract was in the no-strike
clause, which now reads:

“Before any walkoff that oc-
curs the employees would use
the first two steps of the griev-
ance procedure and then re-
quest permission from the In-
ternational before the strike

went into effect. Neither the 10-
cal union nor the International
Union shall be subject to dam-
age suit.” 1

In addition to economic gains,
Leslie saltworkers also estab-
lished for the first time in their
contract, the identical s i ck-
leave provisions prevailing at
the Morton Salt Plant. Also,
the company has agreed to sup-
ply protective clothing for the
men working on the bagging
station.

Members of the Leslie nego-
tiating committee were Elmer
McGee, Paul Newman, Claude
Parkinson and LeRoy Davis.
They were assisted by Interna-
tional Rep. G. L. Buckner and
Board Member Verne Curtis.

Alabama Local

Wins Grievance

SAGINAW, Ala.——Blue Eagle
Lime Workers Local Union 81
has won a grievance on behalf
of Brother Monroe Dowdell. The
grievance went to arbitration

and the case was decided by

Arbitrator A. R. Marshall of At-
lanta, Georgia on August 28.

Dowdell had been a Mill and
Dryer Operator for five months,
until May, 1963 when he was
demoted to laborer. The demo-
tion took place, according to the
company, because Dowdell had
had trouble with the equipment
and was “not qualified” for the
job.

The union contends that the
breaking down of the machin-
ery on May 5 was not Dowdel1’s
fault; that all Mill and Dryer
Operators have had trouble with
their machinery; and that the
company’s action was in viola-
tion of the contract.

Arbitrator Marshall agreed.
He stated, in fact, that “It is
a rather unusual situation, to
say the least, for an employee
to work in a classification for
some five months and then be
told that he is not" qualified to
perform the functions of the
job.” Dowdell was reinstated,
with a reprimand to be “more
careful” in the future.

Chano Merino On
Advisory Group

BAYARD, N. M.—-Brother S.
Q. (Chano) Merino, president
of Mine-Mill Local_890, has been
appointed a member of the L0-
cal Advisory Committee to the

- New Mexico State Employment

Service.
The committee will assist the

Chano Merino

State Employment Service in
the study of vocational training
needs for, the unemployed and
under"-employed’ people in, the
local area. It is felt that such
training will make these per-
sons employable and/or up-
grade their productivity and
earning capacities. This will be
beneficial not only to the train-
ees themselves but to the econ-
omy of the area.

Brother Merino was appoint-
ed to represent labor. Other
members are John Fleming,
representing the general public;
John Hinrichs, agriculture: Wil-
bert_.Hein, education and train-
ing;; and Joseph W. Shuster,
management. Mr. Shuster is di-
rector of la b o r relations for
Kennecott.

Erie Workers
Get 14 Cents

ERIE, Pa.——A two-year, 14
cent ‘package increase to work-
ers at Parker White Metal Co.
in Fairview, Pa., has -been
ratified by the members of
Mine-Mill Local 711.

An 11-cent wage increase is

‘accompanied in the new con-
tract by substantial improve-

ments in the health and welfare
provisions. Almost all parts of
the health and welfare plan
were improved including daily
hospital benefit (up $3.50), ‘mis-
cellaneous hospital (up $70),
maternity ‘(up $35), sickness
and accident weekly (up $10).

Life insurance benefits were
continued for laid off workers
for up to six months following
layoff. _

Incentive W o r k e r s on the
third shift received a 15 cent
per hour bonus in addition to
the present premium of eight
hours pay for seven hours work.
Previously the bonus was ten
cents.

The settlement, according to
International Rep. Joe Scioli,
is unique in that many unions
in the area have recently set-

‘ tled for simple renewals or less.

Members of the negotiating
committee were William Smith,
President; Gerald Firch, Chief
S t e w a r d;% and Gerald Ring,
Donald Burger, Norlan Centner,
and Dhurword Pettigrew, com-
mitteemen. The local was as-
sisted in negotiations by Scioli.

Butte No. 1

Wins Arbifrafion

B U T T E, Mont.—Arbitrator
Thomas H. Tongue has decided

that the Anaconda C 0 mp a n y _

violated the terms of its con-
tract with Butte Miners Union
No. 1 when it unilaterally low-
ered the rate of pay for the ore
loader at the Company’s
Badger Mine.

Before the company switched
over to an ore-loading system
involving the use of a conveyor
belt, the man responsible for
overseeing the smooth flow of
ore through’ chutes, trucks and
rail cars was paid at “miner’s”
rate, i.e., $1.02 per shift more
than surface labor rate.

After the conversion, how-
ever, the ore lo a d e r was re-
duced to the surface labor rate,
even though he was still re-
sponsible for the smooth flow
of operations and performed a
task crucial to the entire opera-
tion. The company maintained
it was a new position; the union
maintained it was not: that the
function was the sam e even"
thcugh the duties were differ-
en .

Tongue ruled that “whether

‘the title of the job is to be

changed from ‘ore loader’ to
‘conveyor belt operator,’ the
job is not a ‘new job’ ” and the
employee is entitled tohis old

. rate _of pay.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

  ' (Following are excerpts from the summation
by Defense Attorney Telford Taylor at the con-

--clusion of the retrial of the Mine-Mill Conspiracy
Case. At this point in his summation Mr. Taylor

if is attempting to describe to the jury the nature

of a conspiracy’ and the evidence necessary to
. prove that one exists.) »
.“. . . I would like to discuss the nature of the
charge here for a moment. What is a conspiracy
charge and what is the sort of conspiracy charged
here? '
“I do this at the risk of being a little repetitive.
Mr. Broome (Chief government counsel) and I

' ‘both discussed it when we opened the case, and
.-Mr. Maddrix (associate government counsel) dis-

-_ lci1sse'cl.it this morning, and the Court is surely
;_.,.,going"to charge-you about this .
_~rI think thereis noreal risk of disagreement here,
because what Mr. Maddrix said in general terms

. 1' is quite right, and that amounts to the fact that

. . later on, but

a conspiracy is an agreement.
" “It is an agreement or an understanding, and
this will bear repeating, because it is «essential
to keep that in
mind in order to
come to a ver-
dict on the ac-
cusation here.
“The partic-
-ular kind of
agreement or
understanding
here which this
i n d i c t m e n t
charges is. an

understanding
that false affi-
davits would be
filed by those
officers of the
union who had
to file affidavits
in order to
comply with the  - 
1'1;:‘Vf.t'Hart1ey Telford Taylor
“Now, ‘again, Mr. Maddrix told you, and quite
‘properly, that there aren’t any formal require-
ments about this agreement. It doesn’t have to
be "in writing. As he said, they don’t have to go
into a room and say expressly what they are
.all agreeing to do. It doesn’t even have to all
take place at one time. You can have a_con-
spiracy done by some, and some people drop out.
“But, when we get all done with that, the fact

1 remains there must be substantial evidence there

was an agreement or understanding. If it doesn’t
come in writing from some exclusive admission
it must come from some source.

“We can’t assume there is some agreement, or
understanding just because we have an indict-
ment and we have seven gentlemen sitting in the
clock. as defendants.

“There must be some substantial evidence

. that these men agreed among themselves that

"false affidavits would be filed, and, unless you
are satisfied that that case is made out, there
must be an acquittal of all of them.

“Now, that means there must be a showing

. that these defendants shared a common knowl-

“edge, -a common knowledge about -this plan to
file false affidavits and they shared ‘in a purpose

" , .to do this.

“A sharing of knowledge and a sharing of

V‘ purpose are -the keys to this problem from your .

standpoint, and so, we must look to see whether
the government has given us anything to go on

    

 Discusses ‘Conspiracy’ Case

to find that there was such a common under-
standing and such a sharing of purpose.
:1: 5: 3}:

“This is a conspiracy to file false affidavits.

There obviously could be no such conspiracy until

the defendants decided to file affidavits at all,
and, as Mr. Maddrix took great pains to tell you,
throughout 1949 the whole policy of this union
was not to file affidavits, and evidence that one
or more of the defendants was a member of the
Communist Party then does not get us anywhere

towards establishing the conspiracy that was ‘said

to have occurred during the following year.‘

“As further foundation for what I am saying,
let me point out to you, ‘perhaps to‘ our own dis-
advantage, that the fact that a person is not a
member of the Communist Party would not
absolve him of this conspiracy. Even if he were
not a Communist, if he had for reasons of his
own agreed that false affidavits would be filed,
he would be guilty. ' .'

“Just the same, it follows that if a person were
a member ofthe Communist Party, ‘unless-he did
agree with these defendants that false affidavits
would be filed, nothing has been proven against
him . . . ’ ‘ -

“Indeed, I will carry it a step further, if you
should be satisfied--we think you shouldn’t and

we will soon say -why-—but if you should be satis-

fied that one or more of the defendants filed a
false. affidavit, that he did remain a member of
the Communist Party and filed false affidavits,
that doesn’t establish the government’s case.
“The Government is really asking you to infer

V fromthe facts—they are ‘asking you.to make this

jumps that if there is-an agreement, not to file
any affidavits at all in 1948 (before the beginning
of the alleged conspiracy) why then there must
have been an agreement to filefalse ones in
1949 and 1950, and I don’t find much logic or

"basis in that ‘sort of inference.

“But, we don’t haveto depend on my notions
of logic or your notions of logic here, because,

— and this is now a matter I want to go through

quite carefully, the entire picture that the prose-
cution has painted here about compliance and
non-compliance is I think utterly false in two
basic respects. , i .

(“In the first place, the prosecution has tried
to convey the idea that Mine-Mill is somehow
out in left field here, that they were adopting a
policy of non-compliance which was peculiar or
unique orleft-wing or something, and they have
tried to suggest that Mine-Mill’s own policies were
determined by a little clique within the Board,
that clique being these defendants and presum-
ably a Communist clique.

“In fact, the record, as we have now made it,
I think is‘ quite clear that neither of these things
is at all true. The policies that M_ine-Mill pursued
in non-compliance or compliance were in no re-
spects different than those pursued by many: other
unions and among those. many other unions the
one you heard most often mentioned as a rival
and competitor ‘the United Steelworkers, with
whom they had the conflict in Butte and Alabama.

“And secondly, I think the record‘ is clear that
far from Mine-Mill policies being determined by
any few of these defendants, these policies were
determined just the way union policies ordinarily
are, conventions, meetings. There were reports,
full discussion and any notion that Mine-Mill’s
policies were dictated by any small group here
is quite wide‘ of the facts.

5l= =l= bl!

“. . . There is nothing here in this whole his-
tory of compliance and non-compliance that isn’t
thoroughly explicable on good solid union grounds,
and that’s all the evidence shows.”

DEAD MEN TELL nus   I

By Nathan Wi'H'
General Counsel
HERECENT retrial of the conspiracy charge had one very
unusual aspect. A dead man testified! This was Bill Mason,
who testified on the first trial in 1959 and who died as a result of
an auto accident last year. Over defense objection, his original
testimony was read to the jurors and they were told by the Judge
that they should consider it as if Mason were still alive and spoke
from the witness stand. ‘

Two aspects of this procedure were particularly interesting.
The first was that the chief prosecutor admitted that Mason, before
his death, had said he never wanted to testify again. In other
words, only his death made it possible for him to help convict the
defendants. Secondly, just before they reached their verdict, the
jurors requested that Mason’s testimony be read to them again.
It is thus clear that his testimony was decisive. I doubt that there
has ever been a trial so ghostly, with a voice from the grave
speaking twice from the witness stand in one trial.

. * ‘Ir *

ORTUNATELY, two other witnesses who testified on the trial

but who refused to testify again are still alive. They are Ken
Eckert and Leo Ortiz. If either or both had died, their first trial
testimony could also have been used against the defendants, as
Mason’s was.
others who have testified against Mine-Mill or its leaders in the
past, but who have declined to do so ever again.)

There are many other things to be said
about the trial, but there is space for com-
ment on only one of them. This is the
acquittal by the jury of Jesse Van Camp.
Of course all of us share Van Camp’s relief
and happiness over his vindication. But it
should also make all of us wonder about the
strange course of justice in this case. Four-
teen leaders of the union were indicted for
the alleged “conspiracy” in 1956. Eleven
defendants went on trial in 1959, for violating
a law which had just been repealed (the
Taft-Hartley, non-Communist affidavit pro-
vision), under an indictment relating to a
period ten years earlier-. Two of the eleven
were acquitted by the trial judge during the first trial. Two more
were acquitted by the Court of Appeals in 1961, when its second

 

Witt

trialfor the remaining seven was also granted. , Now, one of the
remaining seven has been acquitted. But even a lawyer studying.

the evidence would have a hard time figuring out in what ‘way the
remaining six are guility when five in the same “conspiracy”
have’ now been found to be not guilty.
  . * *   * I   '

DOUBT that we will have to go-through any more trials-in this

case. There are at least as many good points on appeal this
time as there were before, so that I am quite confident that the
six remaining defendants will soonbe as clear of this harassing
case as are the other five.

  VAN CAMP sens mm:

This is a message of gratitude from my family and me to our
attorneys, Nathan Witt, Telford Taylor, and George Francis, for
their untiring ‘effortsin defending Mine-Mill against all the unjust‘
charges that have been levied against our great union. We also 3

want to thank all our fraternal brothers and sisters and all the
others who are contributing financial and moral support in order
that one day ea-ch individual who has been falsely accused shall
be vindicated. . '

Since 1956 the court has released five of the original eleven

who were originally indicted for allegedly conspiring to defraud "
the U. S. Government by filing false non-Communist affidavits in- ‘

order to use the services of the N.L.R.B. I was pronounced not
guilty on September 20, 1963, by a jury of six men and six women
in ‘U. S. District Court in Denver. Not one of the remaining six
defendants is any more guilty than those of us who have been

found not guilty. There never was a conspiracy and eventually “ V

it will be proven, if necessary in the United States Supreme Court.

In the meantime harassment of our union will continue through
anti-union paid informers, liars, and stoolpigeons. Other unions

and many people from all walks of life h.ave come to see this«.
attack upon one of the oldest democratic trade unions in the history

of the labor movement as an attack upon the civil liberties of all
unions and individuals. These people have rallied to the aid of
Mine-Mill with moral and financial support and along with new
friends each day they are continuing to do so.

This growing recognition of injustice among the freedom loving
people will finally one day put an end to this all-out attack to
smash Mine-Mill because they know that unless it is stopped the
freedoms we cherish will be absolutely meaningless to every organ-
ization and citizen. My family and I, for the past seven years-
and -I know this goes for the other six defendants'—experienced
character assassination, slander, personal’ physical attacks by fools
and members of our families being denied -employment and even
discharged from jobs they had held for years ‘because of these
unwarranted and unjust indictments. \

The battle is not over. The financial cost to carry this case
through the courts to ﬁnal vindication is tremendous; moral sup-
port is equally important and needed. Therefore, permit meat

this time to call upon all local unions and friends who may not as.

yet have made a contribution or placed themselves on a monthly

retainer to the Mine-Mill Defense Fund to seriously consider. doing,

so at their earliest convenience. a _
With best wishes to all, we remain happy and proud, '
Jesse R. Van Camp and Family.

This Month's Lament

‘His horse went dead, and his mule went lame,
‘And he lost six cows in a poker game;

t ‘Then a hurricane came on a summer day,
And blew the house where he lived away;
An earthquake came when that was gone,
And swallowed the land the house stood on.
And then the tax collector «came around,
And charged him up with a hole in the ground.

A Substantial Wage Increase

WAGE increases are necessary for several logical rea-

sons. First, our members must share in the gains re-
sulting. from sharply increasing output per man—hour.
Second, increased company profits have resulted from
international control of copper prices and_ from recent sub-
stantial increases in the prices of lead, zinc, silver and cad-
mium. Third, the cost of living continues to go up,’ and has
risen more sharply in the last 12 months than in any other
recent year. Wage increases therefore will help prevent con-
tinuing shrinkage in the purchasing power of the pay check.

U. S. government data on increases in output per man-
hour are out-of-date before they become available, and
don’t show the spectacular productivity gains of the re-
cent past or those anticipated. by the co_mpanies.’Tl'1eKen-
necott Company has announced that output in Utah will be
increased by. 50 percent in the next few years, with no in-
crease in jobs. In Butte, the Anaconda.__Company has cut
employment by well over half while increasing output over

‘ _ the short span of six_or’seven years. Similar gains are be-
, ing made at other plants,_ with replacement; of rail haulage

by truck haulage, or truck haulage by skips, -with new type

A‘ furnaces, the so-called autogenous mills,‘ and_ by a hundred
" other innovations. ’  " ’ A it " '

Copper prices in, this country are  by‘   and

A  foreign companies atthe artificial level ,of 31 .cents,_thus
’_ guaranteeing continued high profits. Lead, ‘zinc, silverfand

cadmium have all moved sharply upward in price since the
summer of 1962, lead _and silver by about 25 percent, zinc by

.'13 percent, cadmium by about 40 percent. Trade sources
‘ predict these four metals‘ will all register further price in-

creases in the months ahead. Profits of lead-zinc produc-

ers, who produce silver and cadmium as by-products,

should be running at better than double the rate of 1962 by
mid-1964. . i A ' V  _  i   _' -. 
Job and Income Security  .

IN‘ TIMES when employment is shrinking throughout

American industry, the loss of a job. is a serious blow. It

is becoming increasingly difficult for the laid-off worker to

find another job. Income protection for the laid-off worker
with time payments, mortgage obligations, and food bills to

‘ meet, is a must, to tide him ‘over until he can find another

steady source of income. This often takes months for those
lucky enough to get another job.

Protection against the hardships of layoffs should be
a major bargaining objective for our members. The time

is past when the companies can evade responsibility to their .

employees who are being deprived of employment by the
actions of the companies themselves in eliminating jobs.

As a minimum, we need solid provisions written, into
our contracts that would do thefollowing; . _y  pf,

a. Provideseverance pay for all years of past service
for every employee involuntarily» separated from the
payroll for any reason. This is ‘little ‘enough to ex-
pect from companies whose profits increase as the
payroll shrinks. 4 , i

b. Establish a supplemental unemployment benefit
program combined with severance pay for years of
future service, payable upon severance for any
cause. Severance pay credits for years of future
service should be payable at retirement if not drawn
upon prior to that. time. Supplemental, unemploy-
ment benefits would be paid in addition to state un-
employment compensation benefits, and continue
for up, to one year from date of layoff. '

Improved job and income security is now being recog-
nized and_ applied in major segments of American indus-
try—it was pioneered in the automobile industry and has
been established in the aluminum, iron and steel, rubber,
Sugar, "glass, can, paper,..-shipping and other industries.

gaining for consideration by local unions and
bargaining councils. These demands are based
on the thinking of our last Inte’rnationalCon-

Health and Welfare Objectives

’ E LIST here, only what we consider to be major na-
tional objectives, having in mind that contracts with

- many individual companies need improvement in medical

and other benefit standards, to have benefits provided-on a

if ' service rather than on a cash benefit basis where possible,
and to meet special problems arising where basic benefits I

are provided through company medical facilities‘ and per-
sonnel. We propose as major objectivesi '

a. Elimination of employee contributions ‘ in all exist-
ing health and welfare plans. This is a long term
objective toward which we have been moving with
progressive reductions in employee contributions
over the years. Employee contributions T in our
major chains now range from $1.75 to about $7.00
per month, or from less than 10 percent to nearly
30 percent of the total cost of health and welfare

_ costs to the companies. Achievement of this ‘de-

' mand will place full responsibility for health‘ and

welfare costs where it belongs, and establish a ‘uni-‘
form industry-wide standard for our members.

b. Coverage for retired employees. Medical and hos-
pital expenses can be a heavy drain on the reduced
incomes of retired employees. One of our major ob-

- \ jectives for next year must be to eliminate this
problem by negotiating fully paid hospital -and

— - medical care for retired employees. A ’

,.c.- Improved coverage and; benefits for dependents.

This area of hospital and medical plans should be ex-
amined _and improved by local unions and bargain-
ing councils.

Safety in Mines and Plants

MANY of our contractsnow have safety clauses, . some

- A 1 much stronger than others. In general, however, there
is a lack of uniformity. .Many contracts do not give recog-

nition to unionsafety committees, and do not establish the 

right of union committees to inspect plants or mines, to con-

sult with management at regular intervals, or establish 
procedures for emergency action on unsafe conditions ore“

situations that may arise. The role of safety committees in
mines and at integrated mills, smelters and refineries will

be greatly enhanced _if proposed mine safety legislation is . ‘
enacted. But legislation alone cannot guarantee safety and -

health.

I ‘fl Our objective should be to have every local‘ union ex- ;

amine the operations of ‘its‘"S,afe'ty Committee, or to estab-

’ lish a "Safety ‘Committee if one‘ does not now exist.’ _jCon- .
. tracts should bejpexamined with a__ﬁview to strengthening the
‘ ' "role and. of safety coinmi,ttees. The’ International ‘
 _Union will prepare and propose a_ model safety _comrn_ittee
clause as soon as federal safety legislation fshapesup suf-V

ficiently_ so_ that our contracts. can be tied in with it.‘ A ma-

jor portion of‘ the enforceirierfit,;_ of ’ the Federal Coal Mine *
Safety Act rests with the Uni_ted,".l\(Iine_,Workers of America, ”
pursuant to its National‘; ‘Cpal, "Wage " agreements. ‘Mine-— ‘

Mill’ has proposed strictenforcernent by the federal‘ gov-
ernment in metal and non-rnetallic’mines,_ but union‘ safety
committee responsibilities will inevitably be increased by
any safety lawthat is passed. ‘  j

 C ontracting-Out

I ‘CONTRACTING-Out must be ‘met and stopped with -the A‘ '

strongest possible contract language next year, with’
penalties pn the emp1oyers'for‘violation. This has been a

practice”of‘”increa‘sing frequency as employers have sought ,

to,cut costs, and jobs, in our bargaining units, by letting I

V our ‘work out to contractors, " frequently when our own -
_ members, qualified for this work, have been on layoff."

  Improvement of
Local Union Contracts

EVERY local union bargaining committee should examine
its contractwith a view to strengthening its provisions,

I eliminating as far as possible ambiguous or weak language _
that has led to grievances or to the loss of arbitration cases, ~

removing strings tied to company concessions, streamlining!

procedures, clarifying doubtful language, and eliminating 

dead wood. Three major objectives in the review of con-

; ._tracts_sho_uld_ be the negotiation of the following: ,-
 T j_ ' a. Union ‘security’ in the most favorable form allow-

. able "by the laws‘ of ‘the’ respective states: the union

I  "1 ‘ shop ‘where permittedjbylaw, and irrevocable check-
'off provisions with limited escape periods in states

L presently burdened by anti-‘union security statutes.
I b. Firm agreements, without strings about qualifica-
' tions, guaranteeing "laid-off workers priority in hir-
ing into the other operations of a company, whether

i . at the same location or in another area; with pro-
tection of the older workers" against unreasonable
physical" examinations or rigged aptitude tests, and
including provision’? for retraining on the new jobs

where necessary. Such employees being transferred. 

should"-.. retain all ‘seniority benefits pertaining to

. pensions, holiday‘s,<vacations and other ' benefits.
 c. - Improvement and correction in contract language
"  _ that" has proven: to be inadequate, contradictory or
I ‘ indecisive. In scores‘ of arbitration cases, contract.

language is the measure ofthe arbitrator’s decision. '

i It can prove to -be very important.

Banner Officials Admit Discussion  
Deadlock Really Lockout of Miners

TUCSON, Ariz.—Now in its fifth month, Local 929’s strike against the Banner Mining Company shows no signs of a letup.

On Sept. 20, negotiators for the local union and the company met with U.S. Commissioners of Conciliation William Halloran and

Louis Ziman.

International Rep. Sylvain Schnaittacher ‘announced that ‘no agreement was reached at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting

had been to hear a company
response to‘ a union proposal
made three weeks previously.

5 “At -the very outset of the
meeting,” Schnaittacher said,
‘-‘Mr. Allen Bowman, company
vice-president and -manager of

1 5 its Tucson properties and attor-

ney Ralph Sievright of Phoenix
told.us that even if a settlement
could be reached the company

=.~ /‘zgvould not be able to ‘guarantee

that operations would resume.
“They attributed this to the
existenceof an option agree-

ment with Anaconda Copper Co. A

which would enable the com-
pany to take over Banner’s Palo
Verde Mine at any time between
now and April of 1964.

“This frank statement con-
firms the union’s contention
made before in Arizona Employ-
ment Security Commission pro-
ceedings that the suspension of
work at the property is not due
to a labor dispute but, in fact, is
because the company has had
no intention of operating at this
time. _

“Today we requested the Em-
ployment Security Commission

.-to re-open hearings on -the mat-

ter of unemployment benefits of

,_ Banner workers so that we can

present evidence on the admis-
' sions made ‘by management to-
' day.” . . .
'The Commission has denied
the union’s request for a hearing
and has denied unemployment
compensation to the Banner

- . miners. The union will appeal in

the courts.

 Contributions to the Banner
Strike Fund continue. The local

’ posed of Brothers Nick Morelos,

Ted Martinez, and Cenobio
Robles, has written that “thanks

the International Union and
locals in the southwestwe are
able to maintain our picket lines
and take care of strikers and
their families. Your continued
support will make sure that we
win over Banner’s union-bust-
ing.”

The International Union has
appropriated $250 per week from
the strike fund for the Banner
strikers. Local 890 in Bayard,
N.M., is contributing $100 per
-week and Local 551 in Bisbee is

contributing $75 per week.

  Alaska llnion Doesn’t Know,

 .< Gou!dn’t Gare Less Aboutﬂaoe

A local of the carpenters’ union in Alaska told the
‘President’s Committee on Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity that since “we are not anthropologists” they could
not fill out the Committee’s questionnaire on racial

! .

  

-composition.

As part of its anti-discrimination program, the Presi-
dent’s Committee sent a questionnaire throughout. the

.- nation. asking locals to list the number of Negroes,‘ In-

dians, Orientals, Spanish-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and
other members of minority groups enrolled in each local.

The Alaska local replied that
“. . . we were unable to com-
_ pletely fill out the form on an

» 7 honest basis as we are not an-
 thropologists and we do not

know when a member becomes
or ceases to be a Negro, an In-
dian, an Oriental, a member of
a minority group or any of the
other designations on the form.

“For example, the treasurer
of this local union, to the best
of his knowledge, is part Negro,
part Indian, part Jewish, part
Irish, and has perhaps a little
Swedish blood. Another of our
officers is roughly in_the same

’ category. We do not desire to
' dissect the poor devils and put

part of them in each one of
these columns.’.’

. The local reported one mem-
ber, a Cuban, who “speaks
Spanish, looks like a Norwegian
and drinks like an Irishman.”

“We have many members,”
the local said, “who apparently

”"' have some Negroid blood. In

fact, some of the experts state
that there is only one person
_in one million in the world to-
day that does not have Negroid
blood.

“We have a number of Alas-
kan aboriginals with Eskimo
and Indian blood mixed with

. ' Russian, Scandinavian, Chinese,

and other so-called races whose
sexual . urges resulted in . cross-

 breeding. We also have a num-

ber of members who came
from the Hawaiian Islands. It
appears that their ancestors
were both promiscuous and pro-
lific.

“We have at least one mem-
ber from the British West In-
dies, ancestry unknown to us.
. . . We have several members
newly arrived from European
countries with names that God
could not pronounce and whose
ethnical origin is unknown to
us. 5

“Fortunately, we are a long
way from Govs. Wallace and
Barnett and a man’s race is
none of our business. To quote
Mark Twain, ‘We do not allow
one part of a man to outvote
the other 15 parts,’ as they do
in the Deep South.”

If the man who wrote this
letter is as good a carpenter as
he is an anthropologist, he is a
damn good carpenter.

 

Sucllmry  M-M Convention
Prepares for Steel Raids

SUDBURY, Ont.—The Thirteenth Canadian Mine-Mill -Convention, which met
here ‘Sept. 16-21, heard a Labour member of the British Parliament attack the Steel-.
workers union as “poachers.” _ . 1

James «Hill, Labour M.P. for the mining district of Midlothians in Scotland, said he
was “amazed how any working man can expect improvements under trade unions
that are controlled by the bosses,” and condemned What he described as the “poach-
ing situation” in the trade unions of North America.

Hill was one of four guest
speakers at the Convention,
which also heard from Interna-
tional Vice President Asbury
Howard, of A1ab_ama; Einar
Nilson, chairman of the Falcon-
bridge Nickel Refinery Workers
in Kristiansand, Norway; and
James B y r n e, parliamentary
secretary to the Canadian Min-
ister of Labour. »

The problem of what to =do
about the steel raids was dis-
cussed extensively at the con-
vention, which also heard de-
bate and comment on such
wide-ranging subjects as the

test-ban treaty, discrimination‘ '

against Eskimos and Indians,
the British elections and in-

terest-free scholarships for Ca-

nadian students.

The Steelworkers are believed
to be concentrating their forces
for a series of raids against
Mine-Mill in Western Canada.
In this connection the‘ dele-
gates heard a tape-recorded
address by Herbert W. Herridge,
a New Democratic Party mem-
ber of the Canadian parliament
for the Kootenay West riding.

In an unmistakable reference
to the proposed raids in West-
ern Canada, Herridge said, “Let
me. say that anyone who at-.
tempts to divide the workers in
the mines and smelters of the
Kootenays will receive a.hot..re.-
ception and a rude awakening.”

Asbury Howard spoke at the
convention Sept. 18. His talk
focused on the “conspiracy
case” and other government
legal actions against Mine-Mill,
and on the struggle for civil
rights in the South. ‘

“In spite of all the efforts to
convict the leaders of our union,
not a single case has stood up
and We are certain that when
we get to the higher courts in
the_U. S. we will all be free.”

Howard said that the Ku Klux
Klan and the segregationist
forces. in the South want the
Negroes to resort to mass vio-
lence “so they can murder
more of us.

“We won't do it because it
would put us on the same
ground as they are,” he said.
“We have taken -up the non-
violence campaign led by the
Rev. Martin Luther King. We
believe him in his demands that
an order based on love must re-
place one based on hate.”

The convention endorsed a
proposal of the National Execu-
tive Board calling for restruc-
ture of the Union. The Execu-
tive Board plan envisioned “the
elimination of District Union
officers as now provided . . .
and the centralization of the di-
rection of our affairs under one
central Canadian Executive
Board . . .”

The Board Report, however,

indicated the continuation of
the many beneficial institu-
tions such as the death benefit
plan, the district conventions’,

etc., that had‘ been built up 3

under the district set-ups.

National President Ken Smith H

said that the principal proposal

. here is directed at bringingthe

union to top fighting trim to
win greater gains for the mem-
bership.“even in the face of the
wild and irresponsible continua-’
tion of the raids announced by
Sault Ste. Marie conference of
the Unit ed Steelworkers of
America.”
The plan will be submitted to

_a national referendum.

Fight Wafer Rafe Increases A

SAN MANUEL, 'Ariz.—San Manuel Mine, Mill and Smelter "Workers Local "937

jumped into the thick of the fight to defeat a water rate increase by the Arizona.
Water Co. for the tri-community area of San Manuel-Oracle-Mammoth.)

The Arizona State Corporation Commission, conducting a hearing, was toldin no
uncertain terms by the citizenry of the communities, that there was complete and
united opposition to water rate increases .sough_t by the;Water Company. Arizona
Water is seeking increases of 119 per cent for Oracle, 61 -per cent for: Mammoth, and

7 per cent for San Manuel.-

Mine-Mill Local 937 and its
Ladies Auxiliary, . working with.

various women’s clubs, other

unions» and civic groups, dis-
tributed over 2,000 leaﬂets pre-
pared by Mine-Mill calling for
maximum participation by the

people of the area. The hearing .

attracted "over 600 people and
continued for eleven hours with-
out a break for lunch or dinner.

Spokesman for the Local Union
was former President Fred San-_
chez, who charged the Arizona
Water Co. with raising rates far
beyond a justified level and cre-
ating a tremendous hardship
upon the families residing in
the Tri-County area. “In addi-
tion,” Sanchez said, “the Water

-Company comes before this

commission with a loaded gun
to squeeze more and more profit
from the people.”

Sanchez continued, “This Wa-
ter Company, will make a ghost
town out of, Oracle, Arizona if
the Commission should grant an

‘ increase.” Oracle residents now

pay an average of $26.00 per
month for Water.

Frank Vettorel, international
representative speaking for the
union and its membership, di-
rectly accused the Arizona Cor-
poration Commission of “con-

ducting a hearing that made it

impossible for the people to de-
fend themselves against an im-

mediate in c r e a s e in water 2

rates.” 3

Vettorel said, “This commis-
sion is handling the "hearing
under improper procedures
when it does not seek the facts
as to whether the people have

the ability to pay added water"

rate increases. Experience shows
that this Commission has
granted 62 increases for the
Water Company out of 62 re-
quests for _increases without

taking into account the people’s.
ability to pay them;

Oracle, 'just 12 miles from
the company town of San Man-
uel, in recent months has be-
come a fast-growing town with
sectors- of new housing spring-
ing up for the many San Man-
uel Copper workers moving to
that area. ‘I n c r e a.s ed water
rates will cause an exodusfrom
Oracle. » '

Along with the unions and
civic groups, representatives of

-San Manuel Copper Company

were on hand to oppose the in-
crease. The copper company
spokesman charged the Water
Company with “overcharging
now.” He said that “a water
rate reductiongshould be in or-
der . . . not an increase'.’.’.

San ’ Manuel currently fur-
nishes the water forthe Arizona

Water Co.‘ at five cents‘ per 1,000
gallons while the people of San
Manuel are charged. a monthly
average rate of $12 for water.
Mammoth city officials and the
people of that town are in the‘
process of ‘condemnation of the
Arizona Water Co. plant with

plans to obtain water by pur-

chasingtheir own water plant.
The Corporation Commission

hearing has been rescheduled

for December 10th. '

dolfo Garcia and Local Presi-

dent Abe ' Yanez, along with

’Auxiliary leaders Mrs. Eddie

Sanchez, Mrs. Jesse Lee Brown
and Mrs.'Ben-Horner, in order
to keep the 600 people in the

hall’ for the full eleven hours of

the meeting, provided coffee,
doughnuts and cookies for the
huge gathering.

Pressure Builds for

 Wies1ey Resignation  

. In the aftermath of the explosion which claimed 18
lives at the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company’s potash mine
near .Moab, Utah last month, pressure built up for the
resignation of Otto A. Wiesley, chairman of the Utah

State Industrial Commission.

On September 6, Charles Fer-
guson, National Safety Director
of the‘United Mine Workers of
America, Lewis ‘Evans, special
representative, ‘-Pittsburgh, Pa.;
Frank Stevenson, ‘UMW Utah-
Wyoming district president, and
the presidents of »fouruUMW
Utah locals 1 met ' with Governor
George D. Clyde and-demanded
Wiesley’s ‘resignation.  ' ‘

The coal mine union men pre-
sented a long list of charges to
Governor Clyde._ These ‘ranged

from the fact that the state has
been operating with only one
mine inspector for the past year,
to sloppy mine inspections and
reports, failure to. reply to
correspondence and long delays
in payment of Workmen’s Com-
pensation awards. “Mr. Wiesley
doesn’t have the interests of
the miners at heart,” Stevenson
told the governor.

At Mine-Mill Union press
time, the U. S. Bureau of Mines
investigation report on the Moab
disaster was still in preparation.

Interior Department Report Delayed

An Interior Department spokesman told the Mine-Mill Union late last month that
Secretary Udal1’s report ‘to Congress on mine safety, due September 26, according to
the law passed two years ago, had not been completed and would be submitted as soon
after the deadline as possible. According to the Mine Safety Study Act of_1961, the
Secretary of the Interior was called upon to report on the causes of mine accidents, the
effectiveness of enforcement authority in safety inspection programs, the scope and

adequacy of state mine safety
laws and enforcement, and to
recommend an effective safety
program for metal and non-me-
tallic mines.

Congressman Joseph M. Mon-
toya (D., N.M.) has just advised
the Mine-Mill Union that hear-
ings are unlikely at this session

_ of Congress on the Metcalf-Mon-
toya mine safety bill. This
means, in all probability, that
hearings will be scheduled early
in 1964.

It's Different in Norway

Newspaper ‘accounts of the no---
confidence vote resulting in the
ousting of the cabinet of Nor-
way last August indicate that

A the major factor in the govern-
‘H1-ent’s fall was a public outcry
against alleged negligence by
the government mine safety au-
thorities. This was said to have
led to an explosion last Novem-
ber at King's Bay, Norway, in
which 21 miners‘ lost their lives.
We don’t pretend, to know‘ how
_much merit there is to these
charges. But can you imagine
any state government in this
country being shook up in this
fashion by the negligence, indif-
ference, incompetence and com-
pany domination of its mine
safety program? Contrast what
happened in Norway with the
way the governor of Utah and
the Utah Mining Association
came to the defense of the State
.Industrial Commission when it
c-ame under ﬁre after the Moab
disaster from the United Mine
Workers.

Kelly Mine Resurveyed

. The Kelly _mine at Butte was
resurveyed by the U. S. Bureau

gaof Mines after an initial inspec-

tion last year. Last year's re-
‘port contained a recommenda-
tion that bridle chains or safety
ropes shouldbe installed on the
man cages in the shafts. This
recommendation had not been
followed by the Anaconda com-
pany at the time of the resur-

._ yey. The resurvey report; how-

C, ever, commented as follows:

'j:When hoist ropes were cut ‘off

lowed, including the” following:

Chino "Considering"

A resurvey report of Kenne-
cott’s Chino mine at Santa Rita,
New Mexico, noted that the
company reportedly was “con-
sidering the feasibility” of fol-
lowing a recommendation in the

. original inspection report of last

October, as follows:

“Power systems supplying
electric shovels, rotary drills
and similar equipment, where
the line-to-ground voltage ex-

ceeds 150, should provide a neu- .

tral point;at the originating end-,
through a suitable impedance.

‘ spection, which

time on the agenda. Each year
in the past the Governor of the
State of Idaho has held a Safety
Conference; however, this is the
first time that the unions, repre-
senting the miners, millmen and
smeltermen have had an oppor-
tunity to present their thinking
on safety.

Information on the objectives
of the Governor’s Conference,
or on the possibility of any real
benefits to the miner coming
out of the Boise conference, was
limited, so a subcommittee was
established to investigate and
report back to the full commit-
tee on October 10. The subcom-
mittee is also to bring back sug-
gestions on what to include in

the union presentation to the

Governor’s Conference, in case

it is decided to participate. ,
The committeemen "also dis-

cussed safety and safety en- . S

forcement in the non-ferrous‘
metals industry. Considerable
dissatisfaction was expressed
by representatives on what they
consider the high-handed man-
ner in which the State Industrial
Accident Board dealt with the
efforts of the joint Labor-Man-
agement Committee’s work in
writing the new Mine Safety
Code. Much criticism was also
directed at the State Mine In-
spector for his alleged laxity in
enforcing the Code.

Those representing Mine-Mill
Local 18 at the Safety Meeting
were: Ralph Kolczak (Galena
mine); Harvey Gilman (Page
mine), Max Wadsworth (Page

mine), Ray White (Page mine) -

and J. L. Cochran, International
representative.

Neglect Caused  

Mine Cave-I11

A sordid background of neglect of elementarymine -

safety precautions lies behind the dramatic story of the
rescue last August near Hazelton, Pa., of trapped anthra-
cite miners, Dave Fellin and Henry Throne through an
emergency exit hole drilled 331 feet _down to them in a
coal vein blocked by a cave-in-. Dave Fellin was part
owner and the operator of the small “dog hole” coal
mine in which a third miner, Lou Bova was killed.

Fellin, Throne and Bova were
non-union’ miners operating the
