United States government, agree with those of other investi-
gators, who followed different methods. “The ﬁgures of un-
employment,” says Robert Hunter, in his new book,-“Pov-
erty,” “although imperfect, show that the evil is wide-spread,
even in times of prosperity. . . . In every industrial com-
munity the same insecurity of livelihood, due to irregular
employment, exists.” It has been said that during the an-
thracite coal strike of 1902 the entire supply of mined coal
was exhausted, but the excess of laborers in that district is
so great that within a short time after. the strike was set-
tled a report was sent out on reliable authority that “inter-
mittentlabor is again the lot of anthracite employes. The
collieries do not average more than two-thirds time.”

The census of 1900 shows that 3,523,730, or 15.1 per
cent of all the workers over ten years of age engaged in
gainful occupations, were unemployed a part of the time
during the year. The census of 1900 places the number
of unemployed during some part of the year——1899——at
6,468,964, or  per cent of all workers over ten years
of age. These ﬁgures include the country as a whole, and
include agriculture.* In manufacturing alone the unem-
ployment rose to 27.2 per cent of all the workers, the indus-
trial states of the North and East showing the greatest per
cent of unemployment. In the industrial towns of Haverhill,

"New Bedford and Fall River the number of unemployed

ranged from 39 to 62 per cent."‘*

These ﬁgures, if one could read behind the returns, tell
a story of pitiful hardship and privation which the black
slave never knew. The chattel, in whose body the master
had from $500 to $1,000 invested, was at least provided
with food, clothing and shelter. He may have felt the lash
on his back at times, but he never knew the haunting fear
of hunger, which is the lot of millions of free American

wage workers today.

The signiﬁcance of these ﬁgures of unemployment is
apparent when we compare them as follows:

1899 (census of 1900) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..22.3 per cent unemployed

Study those ﬁgures calmly and dispassionately, my prac-
tical friend. What sort of a story do they tell you? What
are the causes of this unemployment? Back of every effect
is ex cause—search far enough and you will ﬁnd it. Com-
missioner Wright enumerates the superﬁcial causes of un-
employment as follows, page 296 of his report:

Before entering into an analysis of the real causes of
the unemployment of the wage workers, I Wish to consider
the above table brieﬂy, in order to puncture some of the
glaring fallacies spread broadcast by capitalist Writers and
speakers. The real causes of unemployment, as we shall
see presently, are not hinted at by Mr. Wright and his co-
laborers.

We are calmly told by a group of self-satisﬁed reformers
that “drunkenness causes idleness—-hence misery and degra-
dation. Abolish the liquor traﬁic, and you end idleness.”

Mr. Wright’s investigation shows that one-fourth of one
per cent of the idleness which he found existing among the

working class was caused by drunkenness. “It may be well‘

to remark,” says Mr.‘ Wright, page 46, “that it is quite
probable that drunkenness in some cases ‘Was reported as
‘sickness’ by the forbearing Wife when giving data for the
schedule.” Assuming that this is true to a certain extent,

that the ﬁgures given are not far from wrong, one has but

10 Wag/land’s Monthly.

to remember that Mr. Wright tells us the average Working-
man’s family spends 25 cents per Week for liquor. As one-
half of the families investigated reported no expenditure for
liquor it would leave an average expenditure for each work-
ingman who did spend his money in riotous living of 50 cents
per week. Fifty cents per week wouldn’t go very far towards
habitual drunkenness. In the absence of any more deﬁnite
ﬁgures on this particular phase of idleness, We must accept
the conclusions of the Labor Commissioner as approximately
correct——in which case drunkenness among the working class
as a cause of idleness may be dismissed as of little impor-
tance.

Driven to the wall on this proposition, the bourgeois
economist, anxious to throw the responsibility for chronic
idleness upon the Working class, points to the long array of
strikes——strikes, we are told, that are in all cases and at
all times inaugurated by the men. Assuming that this is
true, we ﬁnd charged up against them responsibility for 2.07
per cent of the idleness we ﬁnd in the country. Add to
this the .26 of one per cent charged against drunkenness,
and we ﬁnd, according to the best ﬁgures produced by the
capitalist class, less than 3 per cent of the appalling total
of idleness which exists in the United States, at a time when
the country is enjoying a gratifying period of “prosperity,”
chargeable to the Working class.

“You surely will not charge our beneﬁcent system with
the idleness caused by sickness,” protests the capitalist
apologizer.

I will let Mr. Robert Hunter answer this question, as
follows:

There is no other nation, comparable industrially to the United
States, which is so backward as this country in its knowledge, in
its legislation, in its administrative machinery for dealing with
the insanitary conditions in factories, mines and workshops, and
in preventing or regulating those dangerous processes in industry
which are responsible for a very large number of unnecessary dis-
eases, accidents a.nd deaths. . . . No other country has so
much as our own permitted individuals to disregard, to a criminal
extent, the health and welfare of employes. I dare say no other
nation has so many cases of illness wholly due to preventable
industrial causes as the United States. The workingmen who are

Commissioner Wright’s “Causes” of Idleness.

12 l/l"a.y'land’s Monthly.

crushed, crippled, or killed, who contract incurable diseases, who
are poisoned, or who are incapacitated by carelessness, insanitary
conditions, or dangerous machinery, are so numerous in this day
that in a very few decades we shall look back upon this period

as one of downright barbarism. . . . No one can help knowing
that sickness is caused by vile tenements, by dangerous employ-
ments and insanitary workshops; . . . furthermore, no one

can fail to know that an excessive number of deaths occur among
the work people employed in certain industries and living in cer-
tain tenements. The cause and effect are clear. Then why does
not the owner or employer remedy theicause of the sickness, poverty

. and death’! “He probably does not know it exists” is the ordinary

answer. But it is no answer. Attempt to remedy the evils by
legislation, or by enforcement of the laws, and then you begin to
realize that you are in a ﬁght, and that, for one reason or another,
the landlords and employers are against you. Every movement
you make is watched and attacked. Every bribery will be used
to defeat sanitary measures; that is to say, measures to save life.
Now the conclusion one is forced to draw from an experience of
that sort is not a pleasant one, but the logic by which one reaches
the conclusion seems clear and certain. These men are murderers.

This is a strong indictment, but who is willing to un-
dertake to refute Mr. Hunter’s statement of facts and his
conclusion that the employing and landlord classes are -re-
sponsible to a very large degree for the sickness and disease
among the working class?

“B=ut.t'hese men do not have to work in these unsanitary
and dangerous surroundings!” again protests our capitalist
apologist. Sidney Webb, in “Industrial Democracy,” says:

The wage earner sells to his employer, not merely so much
muscular energy or mechanical ingenuity, but practically his whole
existence during the Working day. An overcrowded or badly ven-
tilated workshop may exhaust his energies; sewer gas or poisonous
material may undermine his health; a badly constructed plant or
imperfect machinery may maim him, or even cut short his days;
coarsening surroundings may brutalize his life and degrade his
character; yet, when he accepts employment, he tacitly undertakes
to mind whatever machinery, use whatever materials, breathe what
ever atmosphere, and endure whatever sights, sounds and smells
he may ﬁnd in the employer’s workshop, however inimical they may
be to health or safety.

The workingman today has no choice——if he does not
like the conditions of employment, the employer or his
agent shrugs his shoulders and informs him thereare plenty

W (1.3/Za»nd"3 Monthly. 13

of men willing to do the job. Pressing necessity and the
cry of the littles ones at home decide the day, and for the
bread necessary to sustain life men will face risks which

the slave master would never have permitted his slave to _

take.

I stood at the mouth of a coal mine in Missouri several
years ago, and I saw cageful after cageful of blackened
corpses brought to the surface; to this day the wails of
anguish from wife and children as the body of the loved one
was discovered rings in my ears, and I won.dered Why men
would take such risks. I was young then—I know better
now. I can now understand why, the day after the Wreck-
age of the explosion had been cleared away, men took their
lives in their hands and faced the unseen dangers of black-
damp, falling slate and gas. They had to live. And then
I learned that a few thousand -dollars spent in measures
of safety would have prevented this sacriﬁce of human life
——-that the law required this to be done. But over against
the law, against the lives of these men, against the tears
of the widows and the fatherless, was balanced. the dividends

of the stockholders of the mining‘ corporation. They lived

in New York and London, and could not be expected to
know the local situatiou———they demanded proﬁts and divi-
dends oftheir superint'endents. The superintendent knew
he had to produce dividends or hand in his resignation, and
to have done that meant that he, too, must face death in
the darkness of the mine. And so the law was violated and
the safety appliances were not installed. Mr. Hunter ‘is
right—these capitalists are murderers~—but there is yet no
law to punish them.

We now come to that other phase of idleness—the “closed
shop.” Not the “closed shop” which Mr. Parry and his
friends talk about—but the shop that is closed because the
capitalist can ﬁnd a market for no more of his goods. Mr.
Wright enumerates under the headings, “Establishments
Closed,” “Unable to Get Work” and “Slack Work,” respon-
sibility for 56.96 per cent of the idleness which he found

_ existed among the Workers. There is no other explanation;

14 Wa.yZand’s Monthly.

simply the shop was closed, or work was slack and the appli-
cant was unable to secure employment.

Now, in considering the real causes which lead up to
this condition of unemployment we are going to get very
close to the trouble which afflicts the organism we call
society.

Since the beginning of the wage system it has been
the dream of reformers and philanthropists that there would
come a time when all men would be employed. Wise solons
in the past and law makers of the present have sought to
solve the riddle, but it has baffled their very best‘ efforts.
The capitalist, the employer of men, knew the effort was
futile. He readily grasped the fact that should all men be
employed the employer would become the slave of an aris-
tocracy of labor.

He understood, dimly it is true, that his modern system
of industry would not work without a great reserve army
of labor. He wanted this reserve for two reasons: In times
of prosperity he needed it to bring him extra proﬁts, but,
in addition to this, he wanted this reserve army of labor
to keep in subjection his employes. There is no known
method of keeping a workingman to his task so effectual
as the fact that just outside the factory door stands a

‘man willing to take his job should he be dissatisﬁed with

the conditions made by the employer.

The cry of “work wanted” was never heard until the
wages system became ﬁrmly established as the prevailing mode
of production. The slave never lacked for a task, nor did the

serf have any idle time. In these former periods there was .

a constant effort on the part of the workers to jump their
jobs——today men ﬁght for the chance to work.

A few months ago a new packing house in Kansas City
advertised for 300 men. Six thousand applied for the jobs
—and they fought for the chance to work. I talked with one
of them a few days after the riot—that’s what the news-
papers called it—a “riot for work.” He was a big, open-
faced Swede—with arms muscled like an ox. He told me
they tore down the railing surrounding the stairway as the
maddened crowd surged forward trying to get to the pack-

Waylomd’s Mo-nthly. 15

 ing house agent. The agent selected the most likely and

the others turned away.

“Modern life,” Mr. John Hobson has said, “has no
more tragic ﬁgure than the gaunt, hungry laborerWvander-
ing about the crowded centers of industry and wealth, beg-
ging in vain for permission to share in that industry, and
to contribute to that wealth; asking in return, not the com-
forts and luxuries of civilized life, but the rough food and
shelter for himself and family which would be practically
secured to him in the rudest form of savage society.”

I think it is clear to the reader that there exists in the
United States a great army of unemployed——you have the
evidence of capitalist statisticians and capitalist writers——
and above all you have the evidence of your own experience.
But why?

There are, you will at once recognize, a number of causes,
but we may, for the purpose of this discussion, sum them
all up in the one word———MACI-IINERY!

So evident is this that even the ‘unimaginative compilers
of the United States Census Reports, p. cxxiii, Volume VII.,
say: “A factor that has had a real tendency to lower the
actual average earnings of the wage earner in many indus-
tries is the displacement of the skilled operative by ma-
chinery, which permits the substitution of a comparatively
unskilled machine hand. The tendency is noticeable in many

‘lines of industry. Its effects are twofold: To reduce the

number of employes producing the same or an -increased
quantity of product, and, hence, to lower the total wages of
the group; and to reduce the average rate of Wagesbecause
of the lower degree of skill required.”

. The census reports are rich in illustrations of this two-
fold tendency, but we will consider but the one showing to
what extent modern methods reduce the number of men rc~
quired to prod_uce a given amount of wealth, thus increas-
ing the number of men unemployed. '

“In the tanning of leather,” says the census report,
“by reason of improved machinery, there has been a con-
stantly decreasing demand for skilled workmen. Women
and girls are now performing Work formerly done by men. In

1890 a ‘shaver,’ who had to serve an apprenticeship of sev-
eral years before he became a skilled workman, received as
high as $6 per day at hand work. In 1900 he had been
quite generally supplanted by the ‘handy man,’ who did the
same Work by machinery, accomplishing four times as much,
and, perhaps, received a third of the pay. . . . These
statistics indicate that the increase in production has been
accomplished very largely through the utilization of new and
improved machinery without a. corresponding increase in
the number of wage-earners and wages paid.”

AMERICA is very rapidly becoming a nation of tenants.
A glance at the above summary discloses this fact-a
fact which our friends of the capitalist parties would hide
from their constituency. Mr. Roosevelt of late has had much
to say about “race suicide”——-but I have seen nothing from
his pen which would indicate that he was aware of the start-
ling tendency toward “home suicide.”

Did you ever read of a “homeless chattel slave”? Did
you ever read of a chattel slave who lived in a rented or a
mortgaged house-—in constant fear that he would be kicked
out by the landlord for non-payment of rent or failure to
meet the interest installment‘? No! Rented and mortgaged
“homes”—eXcuse the satire-—among the working class came
on with the establishment of the wage system of production
by “free” labor, which concentrates the workers into large
cities and industrial centers.

“When this revolution,” says Hunter, “brought into the
world large cities and a new industrial life, it, at the same
time, destroyed what has been described as the Home. In
our largest cities this home no longer exists. The economic

development of the last hundred years has destroyed it and

20 Wwylcmd’s Monthly.

left in its stead a. mere shadow of what once was the source
of all things essential to the world. The home is now a few
rooms in a crowded tenement or apartment house.”

But homelessness, however, is not conﬁned to the large
cities, as one would infer from Mr. Hunter’s remarks, but
extends to the remotest districts in the agricultural states.
The table printed on page 21 is taken from the Census
Reports. It will be noticed that the per cent of rented and
mortgaged homes is greater in the North Atlantic states-
the most advanced industrial section of the country—where
we ﬁnd the greatest per capita wealth and the greatest per
capita of production—the more recently settled sections show-

ing a greater per cent of free homes.

Take New York City, for instance. New York, it
might be mentioned in passing, is the wealthiest city in
the Union. Its banks stand on a par with the ﬁnancial
houses of Europe, and it is whispered that the seat of ﬁnan-
cial power is soon to be, if not already, located on Man-
hattan Island.

In the value of its manufactures it stands at the head
of the list. ,

Its per capita wealth production is exceeded by but three
other American cities.

_ It lead.s in the number of millionaires within its bor-
ders—in point of fact, New York City typiﬁes American
ﬁnancial and industrial progress, and yet what do the census
reports show?

Read in the history of New York City the history of
every other city—and know to a certainty that the home-
less condition of its inhabitants is the condition in which
the people of every other city will ﬁnd themselves at no
distant day. . -

In New York City there are, reported by the census, a
few over 400,000 “homes.” Of this number less than 9,000
are owned free and unincumbered ; less than 14,000 families
have even a mortgaged title to shelter over their heads ;—

And 384,349 are rented!
Ponder over the spectacle. Of the two millions of peo-

. ple in New York City, surrounded on every hand by wealth

outrivaling as does the sun the stars the dazzling splendor
of Rome in her palmiest days of robbery and rapine—a
few over two per cent can say they have a home exempt
from the toll of the landlord and the money shark!

New York City is but a type, a little more intensiﬁed,

_ of other American cities.

The census statistician has painstakingly gathered his
information, and it should damn any politician who claims
responsibility for the prosperous times of the past twenty-
ﬁve years. ‘

Bad as this showing is, it does not convey to the mind
a picture of the true condition of the working class———the
great army of wealth producers.

’ Turning to page clxiii, Vol. II., Census Reports, we ﬁnd
that Manhattan’s 2,000,000 people, embracing 433,000 fami-
lies, live in 100,000 dwellings. Take from this one—half of
the houses owned free and mortgaged, and, assuming that
but one family lives in each, it leaves 90,000 dwellings to
400,000 families.

Startling as this condition is, the situation is steadily
growing Worse. Says the United States Census Report, page
cxciii, Vol. II.: “These percentages, as compared with simi-
lar percentages for 1890, show a slightly increased propor-

_ tion of both hired and encumbered homes, and a correspond-

ing decreased proportion of homes owned free. Nor is this
homeless condition conﬁned to the city proletariat.” Says
the Census Report, page and volume last quoted: “A com-

‘parison of the percentages for farm homes shows conditions

similar to those already stated for all homes.”

The table on page 21 is a reproduction of plate No. 19,
Volume IL, United States Census Report. It shows the pro-
portion of homes owned————free and mortgaged—and rented.
This report was made at a very favorable time. On page

59 (lix), Volume VII., the report says:

The census of 1900 was taken at a time of special activity and
productivity in manufactures, and thus its record is of a volume of
industry at almost high-water mark. The same general conditions
existed during the census of 1890, in a. degree less marked, perhaps,

Wayland’: Monthly. '23

but so nearly identical that comparison between the statistics of the

two censuses can safely and satisfactorily be made. There is, per- _

haps, no decade covered by previous censuses in which the con-
ditions were so nearly alike at the beginning and at the end of
the decade. This may be shown by brief reference to the business
situation at the time of each census. The year 1889 was highly
prosperous, passing all previous years in the volume of business

done. . . . The argricultural crops were the largest in the
history of the country. These large crops stimulated business in
all directions. . . The development of manufacturing in the

decade that followed was retarded by a period of pronounced busi-
ness depression, ﬁrst manifested in the second quarter of 1893,
and extending into 1896. . . . The gradual restoration of busi-
ness conﬁdence began in 1896, and 1897 was a year of recovery.
Large and remunerative crops from 1896 to 1899 accelerated this
recovery, and an increased demand for all varieties of product
infused unusual activity into manufacturing enterprises. The ap-
proach of the census year (1900) found the capacity of every line
of manufacture tested to the utmost.

I have quoted thus at length from the report in order
to get the thought ﬁrmly ﬁxed in the mind of the reader
that we are discussing ﬁgures indicating the high-water mark
of capitalistic prosperity. Naturally, during prosperous times
men buy homes, and it is not assuming too much to say
that every family who possibly could availed themselves of the
extraordinary opportunity to secure this very desirable pos-
session. But What do the ﬁgures tell us? Says the govern-
ment statistician, page 193 (cxciii), Vol. II.:

From this summary it appears that of the 16,187,715 homes
on the mainland of the United States in 1900, 7,259,362 are re-
turned as owned by the families living in them, 8,365,739 as hired,
leaving 562,614 for which the facts of proprietorship were not
stated. Disregarding the unknown element and considering the
percentages based upon known proprietorship, it appears that 46.5
per cent of all the homes in 1900 are owned and 53.5 per cent
are hired. The owned free constitute 31.8 per cent. . . . These
percentages, as compared with similar percentages for 1890, show
a slightly increased proportion of both hired and encumbered homes
and a corresponding decreased proportion of homes owned free.
. . A comparison of the percentages for farm homes shows
conditions similar to those already stated for all homes.

A careful study of the diagram on page 21 will show
that the older, richer and more advanced the communttr, the

larger is the per cent of hired or rented and encumbered
homes.

In Alaska, where man is just emerging from “primi-
tive savagery,” and where the beneﬁcent reign of the higher
civilization has not yet been introduced, less than twenty
per cent of the people live in hired homes. And, strange,
the census does not report a single mortgaged home! Be-
nighted Alaska—may she be redeemed from her ignorance
and stupidity.

Next come New Mexico, Oklahoma, Idaho, Nevada and
Utah.’ Here the blessed mortgage——that badge of prosperity
—-makes its debut and spreads its slimy coils around the
ﬁresides of the free American people.

Gradually the tenant and the mortgagor make their way
down through the line of states. The free homes disappear
under the banner of the auctioneefs red ﬂag and the ten-
ant takes his place in the procession. Wisconsin, Vermont
and North Dakota are neck and neck for ﬁrst place in the
greatest number of mortgaged homes.

New Jersey leads the procession with the smallest per
cent of homes owned free and the greatest number of rented
houses, with the exception of the trust-ridden island of
Hawaii. Bhode Island, a state that produces more wealth

, per capita than any state in the Union, follows next, with
New York, the great Empire State, following a close third._

Massachusetts shows less than one-fourth of her families liv-
ing in homes free from encumbrance.

And what effect has this industrial revolution, which
has made homeless the wage—worker, had upon the individ-
ual? Here again we may quote from Mr. Hunter-’s book,
“Poverty,” with the assurance that he has not overdrawn the
picture. It exists as he describes it, as you may see for
yourself——if you are so fortunate as not to be a part of it:

Without tho security which comes only with the ownership
of property, without a. home from which they may not be evicted,
without any assurance of regular employment, without tools with
which they may employ themselves, they are pathetically dependent
upon their physical eﬂiciency-their health and strength, and upon

the activity of machinery, owned by others, and worked or left idle,
as the owners consider it Wise or proﬁtable. . .

In this community of workers several thousand human beings
were struggling ﬁercely against want. Day after day, year after
year, they toiled with marvelous persistency and perseverance.
Obnoxious as the simile is, they worked from dawn until night-
fall, or from sunset until dawn, like galley slaves, under the sting
of want and under the whip of hunger. On cold, rainy mornings,
at the dusk of dawn, I have been awakened two hours before my
rising time by the monotonous clatter of hobnailed boots on the
plank sidewalks, as the procession to the factory passed under
my window. Heavy, brooding men, tired, anxious women, thinly
dressed, unkempt little girls, and frail, joyless little lads, passed
along half awake, not one uttering a word as they hurried to the
great factory. From all directions thousands were entering the
various gates—children of every nation of Europe. Hundreds of
others—-—-obviously a hungrier, poorer lot than those entering the
gates; some were most ragged and almost shoeless, but all with
eager faces—waited in front of a closed gate, until ﬁnally a great
red-bearded man came out and selected twenty-three of the strong-
est, best looking of the men. For these the gates were opened, and
the others, with downcast eyes, marched off to seek employment
elsewhere, or to sit at home, or in a saloon, or in a lodging house,
until the following morning, when they came wistfully again to
some factory gate. In this community, the saddest in which I
have ever lived, fully ﬁfty thousand men, women and children
were all the time either in poverty or on the verge of poverty.
It would not be possible to describe how they worked and starved
and ached to rise out of it. They broke their health down; the
men acquired in this particular trade a painful and disabling
rheumatism, and consumption was very common. The girls and
boys followed in the paths of their parents. The wages were so
low that the men alone often could not support their families, and
mothers with babies toiled in order to add to the income. They
gave up all thought of joyful living, probably in the hope that
by tremendous exertion they could overcome their poverty; but
they gained while at work only enough to keep their bodies alive.
Theirs was a sort of treadmill existence, with no prospect of any-
thing else in life but more treadmill. When they were not given

work in the mill they starved; and when they grew desperate they ‘

came to my omce and asked for charity.

And yet, whatever the ills of mankind, they seem to weigh
heaviest upon the children. The enormous number of deaths in
certain parts of our largest cities has been referred to as the
“Massacre of the Innocents.” In certain rear tenements, in dark
rooms and in the most unsanitary portions of the “double decker”
tenements, and especially in certain unsanitary and pestilential
blocks, the death rate of children under ﬁve years of age is a

26_ Wag,/land’s Monthly.

matter of public disgrace. The death rate of children under ﬁve
years in those places where there were both front and rear tene-
ments ran up as high as 204 per thousand. In other words, four
or ﬁve times as many babies die in these houses as in the houses
of the well-to-do districts. If this same rate were maintained
among all the poor (which is not probable), of 1,000,000 babies
under ﬁve years, 200,000 would die annually; while of 1,000,000
babies in well-to-do districts only 50,000 would die. The Tene-
ment House committee of 1894 called these rear tenements “verit-
able slaughter-houses.” . . .

These present-day problems of the child-—the cities, the com-
ing of immigrants, the collapse of home life, the yardless tene-
ment—are all due to one underlying cause. There has been an
entire revolution of industry during the last century, and nearly
all the social problems of child life have grown up as a result
of this revolution. The best thought of this entire period has
been given to industrial development—to economy, wealth, proﬁts
and wages. That the needs of the child have been overlooked, if
not entirely forgotten, in the readjustment of society to the new
conditions, cannot be questioned.

When children are robbed of play time they too often reassert
their right to it in manhood, as vagabonds, criminals and prostitutes.
There is a time for work and there is a time for play. A well
known educator has said: “Play is the ﬁrst and only occupation of
our childhood, and remains the pleasantest our whole life long. To
toil like a beast of burden is the sad lot of the lowest, the most un-
fortunate, and the most numerous class of mortals, but this is con-
trary to the intent and wish of nature.” Whether or not it is con-
trary to the intent of nature, at this moment, after one hundred
years of war has been waged for the abolition of child-salvery, over
1,700,000 children under ﬁfteen years of age are toiling in fields, fac-
tories, mines and workshops. “You cannot put tired eyes, pallid
cheeks and languid little limbs into statistics.”

This evil of child labor is a new evil. It was brought into
existence by the factory system, as the street child was brought
into existence by the tenement. And now, in this day of steam
and electrical power, when the mere force of one’s hands is the
most insigniﬁcant part of production, and when numberless ma-

chines are able to turn out a hundred and a thousandfold more 1

than it was possible for men to do when aided only by simple
hand-tools, child labor has become an evil—superﬂuous and wicked
—a shame to our civilization and an inexpiable crime against hu-
manity.

Child labor has been synonymous with “child-s1avery” during
the entire last century. Any one reading the literature of the
previous centuries will see that child labor was never so thought of
before. In the days of home industry it was a most natural and
proper thing that the child should be a. “little helper” to father and

mother; “little brother” once meant that, I believe. In the home
ﬁelds the child was learning to do the work of the world, and
there was both wisdom and kindness in teaching his little hands to
master the simple industrial processes. The work was neither
dangerous nor conﬁning, neither a monotonous, uneducative routine,
specialized as it is now, to a hundredth part of a man, nor was it
injurious to those of tender years and tender bodies. It was the
source of the child’s real and vital education, and, as a little helper
or apprentice, the child was given attention, direction, taught the
use and value of materials and skill of hands, so that, in a few
years, he was graduated a craftsman with a joy-giving and digniﬁed
calling. The workshop was his school, and it was a good school,
with able and competent teachers. But what was a blessing in this
age became a curse in the next.

A vagrant whom I once knew had for ﬁve years—from the day
he was eleven until the day he was sixteen———made two movements
of his hands each second, or 23,760,000 mechanical movements each
year, and was, at the time I knew him, at the age of thirty-ﬁve,
broken down, drunken and diseased; but he still remembered this
period of slavery sufficiently well to tell me that he had “paid up”
for all the sins he had ever committed “by those ﬁve years of hell.”
But there is yet one thing that must be added to the picture. Give
the child a tenement for a home in the ﬁlthy and muddy streets of
an ordinary factory town, with open spaces covered with tin cans,
bottles, old shoes, garbage and other waste, the gutters running
sewers, and the air foul with odors and black with factory smoke,
and the picture is fairly complete. It is a dark picture, but hardly
so dark. as the reality, and if one were to describe “back of the
yards” in Chicago, or certain mill towns or mining districts, the
picture would be even darker than the one given.

It is a dismal picture, is it not? You have been boast-
ing of the splendid condition of the “American working
class.” And you have been unconsciously aiding in its per-
petuation by your vote and your inﬂuence. Contrast, if you
will, the condition of the black slave before the War with
that of the free wage-worker today. The following extract
is taken from an article printed in a ,recent issue of the
Atlanta, Ga, Constitution:

The negro in slavery had no thought for the morrow, but he
spent his quiet, humble life in his little cabin, with his master to
care for every want of self and family. He lived under the best
hygienic restraint. His habits of life were regular, food and cloth-
ing substantial and suﬁicient, and the edict of his master kept him
indoors at night and restrained him from promiscuous indulgence and

In the Congress of 1776, John Adams observed:
“That as to this matter, it was of no consequence
by what name you called your people, whether by
that of free men or slaves. That in some coun-
tries the laboring poor men were CALLED freemen;
in others they were CALLED slaves; but the differ-
ence was imaginary only. What matters it whether
a» landlord employing ten laborers on his farm,
gives them annually as much as will buy the neces-
saries of life, or gives them those necessaries at
short hand.”—From the “Lost Principles of Sec-
tional Equilibrium.” by “Barbarossa,” 1860, p. 39.

Pope Leo XIII., on May 15, 1891, said: “But all
agree, and there can be no question whatever that
some remedy must be found, and quickly found, for
the misery and wretchedness which press so heavily
at this moment on the large majority of the very
poor. . . . By degrees it has come to pass that
workingmen have been given over, isolated and de-
fenseless, to the carelessness of employers and the
greed of unrestrained competition. . . . And to
this must be added the custom of working by contract,
and the concentration of so many branches of trade
in the hands of a few individuals, so that a small
number of ver rich men have been able to lay upon
the masses 0 the poor a yoke little better than
slavery itself."

the baneful inﬂuence of the liquor saloon. In sickness he was
promptly and properly cared for by physician and nurse.

I do not know what may be the object of southern
journals in raking up this kind of stuﬁ, unless it is to taunt
the black man with What he has lost. Surely no master
would advocate a return to chattel slavery after a half-cen-
tury of prosperity under the wages system. The slave might
desire a change to the good old days before the War, but
the master——never.

As advantageous as may have been the system of chattel
slavery in America to the slave, as compared with the pres-
ent system, there is no hope for either the black or white
wage-worker in looking to the past. It is the future that

holds the key to the situation. That under the prevailing»

condition advantages have come to the working class there
is no quest‘ion—but that these advantages have kept pace
with the power and privileges of the capitalist class I deny
most emphatically. By comparison there is a Wider gulf,
measured by dollars and cents and economic advantages,
between the wage-Worker and his employer today than ex-
isted between the slave and his master or the serf and his

lord. In support of this statement, I refer you to the in-,

formation collected by Mr. Wright, the labor commissioner
for the United States, the Census Reports, Mr. Hunter’s
book and the evidence which you see on every hand.

Look at the problem from whatever point of view, we
are forced to accept the rather remarkable declaration of
John Adams quoted in a previous chapter.

Then why all this struggle? Is it hopeless? By no
means, my dear reader, as I hope to show you presently.

How the Workman Lives.

MR. WRIGHT, after his exhaustive inquiry, ﬁnds that
the income of the average American family, including
husband, Wife and children, is $827.19.

How is it spent?

Here again We are enlightened by the United States
Labor Commissioner. He has gone into the homes of the
American workingmen and inquired minutely into What it
costs to maintain the Worker and his family, much_ as a
dealer in ﬁne stock would investigate the cost of keeping
and reproducing Shorthorn cattle or Berkshire hogs.

We are told that the expenses necessary to keep the
household in fair Working order are, on an average, $768.54.
This goes for the necessities of life.

Theoretically the workingman in America is supposed
to live in a mansion and own a piano and an automobile,
but in reality he does not. It is true he makes the piano
and the automobile and he builds the mansion——but he does
not own them nor does he use them.

He does not spend his money in this frivolous man-
ner——though the Rev. W. B. Leach, of Chicago, tells a sur-
prised World that the American people spend $700,000,-
000 on jewelry, $178,000,000 for candy, $80,000,000 for mil-
linery and several hundreds of other millions for various
luxurious items, but only a very small portion of these luxu-
ries goes into the homes of the working class. The worker
needs muscle. His “necessities are necessities,” observes
Hunter. “l\Tecessity’s sharp pinch is like a steel vise. There
is no give to it. Necessity is like ﬂint or granite. It is
irresistible. It cannot be shuﬁled or altered.”

So the workingman goes into the market and he buys
muscle-producing food. Commissioner Wright has also item-

Look it over carefully and see if you discover any ex-
penditures for jewelry, and such. I don’t. This is the

‘ standard of living which the president of the United States

declared emphatically must be maintained. In his letter of
acceptance he told prospective voters, most of them mem-
bers of the Working class, that his party would continue to
be good to them.

And yet, is it not a fact that the slave masters of ante-
bellum times Were as good to their slaves? Did they not
provide them with food and clothing and raiment, and a
place to sleep? How much better off is the American White
slave of today?

You say he has freedom? Yes, he is free to quit his
job and ask for another. He may even become an employer,
and, later on, a capitalist——but this does not change the re-
lationship of the two great classes in America. For every
Workingman who becomes a capitalist, two capitalists are

shoved down into the ranks of the proletariat to become
competitors in the a.lready overcrowded labor market.

As Mr. Roosevelt has pointed with pride to the show-
ing exhibited by his labor commissioner’s report, we must
assume that this is the best which the capitalist system has
to offer for the American workingman.

He i.s to have the muniﬁcent sum of $12.29 for vaca-
tions and amusements. “Recreation and recuperation,” ob-
serves one writer, “are vital necessities to the man whose
work is hard, intense and spurred on by the feverish com-
petitive spirit of American life.” No one will deny this,
yet who will contend that the American working class en-
joys that recreation necessary to maintain a healthy phy-
sique? Mr. Wright ﬁnds that less than three per cent of
all the workers in the United States are so situated that
they can take a much-needed vacation.

Unable to do this, the worker wears away his life until
at last he can stand the strain no longer and he becomes a
ward upon the charitably inclined.

Professor Edward D. Jones, a. capitalist economist, says the
necessity for higher wages than the worker now receives “is based
upon the observation that, in the purchase and sale of labor on
the market, all the necessary and legitimate costs of producing
labor and not provided for in the Wages received. -Such transac-
tions are not completely economical, and do not meet the claims
of social justice. Fair wages must include more than enough to
support the laborer while working, and must cover compensation
for seasons of idleness due to sickness, old age, youth, lack of
work, or other causes beyond the control of the laborer. Skill
must be so paid for as to cover the expenses of education and
the risk of failure. The Wages of those who Work should include
enough to support that proportion of every normal society of
human beings which cannot or ought not to be earning wages.
When one pays for a vase he pays not merely for the one given
him, but for a part of those which have been ruined in the mak-
ing or broken in handling, so the cost of labor should include the
expenses of those who die in youth or who, in age, live to be a
charge upon others. As the vase in fashion must pay for a part
of a superseded stock, so wages must take account of superseded
skill. If these elements in the social cost of labor are not pro-
vided for directly by wage payments, they must be surreptitiously
added as public or private charity. If withheld entirely, the deteri-
oration of the society concerned is certain.

32 Wayland’s Monthly.

How cramped and pitiful is the life of the man who
does the work in the United States one can understand by
glancing at the itemized list of his expenditures, which is
reproduced on page 30.

Twenty dollars is spent per year in cases of sickness
and death. Reduced to the ﬁve members of the family, it
means about $4 per year for each. It probably cost the
slave master less to care for his slaves, but the slave was not
under the severe mental strain that is the lot of the free
worker. Medical science attributes to mental exhaustion
many of the diseases which today afflict the working class.
Not the mental exhaustion which comes from productive
labor—but the eﬁort to keep the wolf from the door and
the endeavor to keep one’s footing in the ﬁerce struggle for
existence.

Imagine taking one’s wife and children to the seaside
on $20 per year! '

Imagine one taking his family to a mountain resort
and permitting the nature-starved babe to breathe the germ-
less air on that sum!

Again we ﬁnd the workingman and his family yearly
spend $26 for furniture. How many pianos would that
provide? This sum wouldn’t furnish a dog house for a sec-
ond-rate captain of industry——yet it is expected to furniture

a a workingman’s home.

Of books and papers he has a supply-—such as it is.
Eight dollars and thirty-seven cents will not go far towards
educating a family of growing children and at the same
time supply the father with his daily newspaper and his

' weekly and monthly magazines and the mother with an occa-

sional book and a household journal or two. This triﬂe
would not buy Harry Lehr’s cigars for a day-——yet it is ex-
pected to furnish the means for educating a workingman’s
family for twelve months.

Your moralists will point to the fact that the working-

, man spends $23.16 for liquors and tobacco, and they will

tear their hair while pointing to the evils which follow this
accursed traﬁic-—forgetting that it is the proﬁts from the
liquor and tobacco taxes which enable the government to.

carry on its foreign policy and send ships and munitions
of war to the Orient. They overlook the fact that they
are partners with the saloon-keeper, the distiller and the
brewer in debauching mankind for a few miserable dollars

- of proﬁt. They overlook the fact that in the White House

of the United States more is spent in a day for wines and
tobacco” than the workingman’s family spends in a year.
They overlook the fact that the men and women who sup-
port the pulpits, from which are hurled these diatribes at
the extravagance of the ‘poor, consume many millions of
dollars per year in champagne, and that a Morgan will in
one day spend more for wines than the workingman does in
ﬁve years.

One hundred and seven dollars is expected to clothe
a family of ﬁve winter and summer—while one society
woman in New York boasts of spending $30,000 on her
wardrobe! An Easter bonnet of a dame of fashion would
wipe out the whole sum. And you wonder that the poor
sometimes murmur?

You point to the sum expended for “other purposes.”
You tell me that it is here that the working class gets the
things which are necessary for their welfare and happiness.
Search the list carefully and you will ﬁnd no item covering
the sums expended for railroad fare, street car fare, and
the innumerable little incidentals which capitalism has placed
so cleverly in the way of the simple-minded Workingman
and his family. The sum expended for incidentals, which
you point to as covering all those things which go to make
life pleasurable, are wiped out by the daily street car fare
extracted from the workingman in the city, and by the horse
and cart used by the miners and other workmen in going
to and from their places of labor. The worker has to follow
the job——and he pays his own expenses.

But, again, you point to the fact that the income of
the average American family of ﬁve, consisting of husband,
mother and three children, is $827.19, while the expenses
during the same period are but $768.54-—leaving a net gain
to the workingman and his family of $58.65. This repre-
sents the savings for ﬁfty-two weeks. It shows a surplus

of—think of it—a little over $1 per week. Is this not a
muniﬁcent sum? Here is a family of ﬁve—consisting of
at least two wage earners—by dint of economy and deny-
ing themselves many of the things which you consider actual
necessities of life—laying by for future emergencies one dol-
lar per week! Gracious, generous capitalism! He surely
must be an ungrateful man who would ask for more!

But here, again, we see the clammy hand of commer-
cialism. Is the workingman and his family permitted to keep
this little horde, laid by with such painstaking care and
denial? What do you gather from the long list of defaulted
savings banks, insurance companies, building and loan asso-
ciations, and the countless other “safe” institutions where
the workingman is invited to place his money in trust? But
the danger does not stop here. Grant that the bank or
other safe deposit institution remains intact. The working-
man is growing old; for twenty years he has saved and the
little home is nearly paid for. Another year and the place
will be out of debt.

The shop closes down!

Out of Work!

The days pass, lengthening into weeks and months.
The interest comes due on the mortgage—then the prin-
cipal. Finally the sheriff knocks on the door, and the gray-

‘ haired old man and old woman are invited to step down and

out. And, mayhap, if they do not move fast enough to
suit the minion of the law, the old people are forcibly told
to move on. The capitalist class do not consider these mat-
ters—they are but triﬂes to them, surrounded as they are
by the wealth from the toil of these people. You consider
these things the workings of a divine providence, with which
politics and politicians have nothing to do. And yet when
you go to Argentine, Kan., the people will tell you that
it was the smelter trust that a few years ago closed the
big smelters and caused wide—spread disaster to the toilers.
It was Robert T. Lincoln who closed the doors of Pullman-
town last year and set 7,000 men and their families adrift.
It was the Pennsylvania railroad and other great eastern
corporations that during 1904 discharged more than 75,000

men, making homeless that many families—-wiping out in
a few short months the savings of years.

The statistics of Mr. Wright furnish us ample proof
of the correctness of the observations made by writers who
have personally investigated the home life of the working
class. Says Robert Hunter:

In the same cities, and, indeed, everywhere, there are great
districts of people who are up before dawn, who wash, dress and
eat breakfast, kiss wives and children, and hurry away to work
or to seek for work. The world rests upon their shoulders; it moves
by their muscles; everything would stop if, for any reason, they
should decide not to go into the ﬁelds and factories and mines.
But the World is so organized that they gain enough to live upon
only when they work; should they cease, they are in destitution
and hunger. The more fortunate of the laborers are but a few
weeks from actual distress when the machines are stopped. Upon
the unskilled masses want is constantly pressing. As soon as em-
ployment ceases suffering stares them in the face. They are the
actual producers of wealth., who have no home nor any bit of soil
which they can call their own- They are the millions who possess
no tools and can Work only by permission of another.‘ In the main
they live miserably, they know not why. They work sore, yet gain-
ing nothing. They know the meaning of hunger and the dread of
want. They love their wives and children. They try to retain their
self-respect. They have some ambition. They give to neighbors in
need, yet they are themselves the actual children of poverty.

The Worker’s Family Life.

FEW persons in the United States have not read of the
tenement districts in New York and Chicago. Jacob
Riis, friend and co-laborer of President Roosevelt, has done
much to familiarize the public with the manner in which
millions of the lowest-paid toilers live, rear their young,
and die in the fetid and disease-infected slum districts. Riis
has been making a gallant, though ineifective, ﬁght against
the slum. In an address whi.ch he delivered recently, I heard
him make this remark: “Thirty years ago, when I com-
menced this ﬁght, there were 40,000 windowless rooms in
New York. Today there are 360,000—and they exist in
deﬁance of the law.” ”

Like a chronic ulcer, society has grown used to the
New York and Chicago sore spots. We ﬂatter ourselves that
it is conﬁned to these cities. But it isn’t, and as indus-
trialism grows the hard conditions of the working class he-

. come more unbearable.

Cleveland, Ohio, aspires to be the “City Beautiful.” It
was the home of Senator Hanna and John D. Rockefeller.
Within its limits millions of dollars have been absorbed by
the captains of industry—it is a typicalindustrial commu-
nity of the more decent sort. Its chamber of commerce
recently appointed a committee to investigate the conditions
of the working class in Cleveland. It is needless to say that
the republicans will not use the result as a campaign docu-
ment. From the report the following extracts are made:

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY.

A few generations ago a man depended largely upon the Work
of his own hands for supplying his wants. He was largely inde-
pendent of the labor of others, and there was, likewise, small ‘de-

Wayland’s Monthly. 3’?

mand for his services. As a result, it was not necessary that he
live near the base of supplies, and in direct touch with thousands
of other men. There was practically no “labor market.” With
the introduction of machinery came an industrial revolution. Me-
chanical was largely substituted for muscular power, and the fac-
tory, with its division of labor, was introduced. Now men, instead
of being independent in their means of livelihood, are largely inter-
dependent. The head of the family must be near a common ex-
change, where his services will ﬁnd a market value. The clothing
which he wears, and the food which he eats, instead of being pro-
vided by himself and a few of his neighbors, are furnished by the
combined labor of thousands all over the world. In exchange, his
labor must be available equally to these thousands, through the
medium of the factory, the mill or the shipping house. The fac-
tory operative, the shop girl, the street vender, the boot—black, all
must be near the scene of the day’s work; the day laborer must
live near the center of his ﬁeld of action, for in all these cases
the time and money which might be spent in transportation are
important factors. As has been shown, in the earlier stages of the
present industrial system this resulted in the workingrnan’s small
cottage near the center of industrial activity. But as demand for
labor grew greater the only way in -which increased rent charges
could be met was by ﬁlling up houses, moving into smaller apart-
ments and taking lodgers—the ﬁnal. result being the crowding of
every available corner in the double—decker.

THE BROOD OF MISERY.

It was gathered that immorality, perverted sexuality, drunk-
enness, pauperism, and many forms of debauchery, were caused
in some instances, in _others abetted, by the indecent overcrowd-
ing which existed; high death rates; a pitiful increase in infant
mortality; terrible suffering among little children; scrofula and
congenital diseases; ophthalmia, due to dark, ill-ventilated, over-
crowded rooms; sheer exhaustion and inability to work; encour-
agement of infectious diseases, reducing physical stamina and thus
producing consumption and diseases arising from general debility,
were some of the evils of over—crowding. ‘

BREEDING SPOTS FOR DISEASE.

They are inhabited by the laboring classes, comprising people
of all nationalities, living in their respective neighborhoods or
streets, in crowded quarters, engaged in exhausting labor, and both
working and sleeping in unsanitary surroundings. The air inside
these houses during the cold months is bad, the result of having been
breathed over and over again, until most of the available oxygen is
taken from it, and the excretive products of the lungs have accu-
mulated in it. In many of these rooms, especially those of the mill

workers, from two to six people sleep at night, and when oil‘ to work
this room is occupied as a sleeping apartment by an equal number
of night laborers, who sleep during the day. The windows are kept
battened up in winter, ventilation being a thing apparently not
thought of. ‘

EAT, SLEEP, LIVE, IN ONE ROOM. I

Mark off upon your ﬂoor six paces in one direction and seven in
the other and you have the space in which over 50 per cent of these
families are carrying on their existence. It must be remembered
too, that these advantages are deceiving, for very often the largest
families are housed in the smallest quarters, and vice versa. For in-
stance, we ﬁnd seven people living in two rooms with an area of only
160 feet, while all are sleeping in a single room.

‘I’ * if i * * * * * ‘I

Nearly one-fourth of the apartments examined contained living
rooms which were slept in as well, while one-ﬁfth of all apartments
had every room used for both living and sleeping purposes. These
were largely two-room apartments. . .

More serious still, of course, is the case where all sleep in a
single room. For instance, we ﬁnd nine people-—father, mother, four
children, and three lodgers—all sleeping in a single room. Two of the
children are small, while two are about 14 years old. The moral in-
ﬂuence of these promiscuous relations must be most demoralizing.
Imagine the conditions where all the functions of living, including
cooking, eating, dressing, sleeping, bathing, giving birth to children,
are carried on in a single small room.

BATHING EXTRAORDINARY.

The lack of bathing provisions in these districts is so universal
as to make a table showing the extent of their existence unnecessary.
In Block 1 there is not a single bath tub; in Block 2 there is one; in
Block 3 is one; in Block 4 six were found; in Block 5 two, and in
Blocks 6 and 7 one. In other words, about.99 per cent of the people
inhabiting these districts are absolutely without respectable provis-
ions for bathing.

The Better Way.

If our forefathers had been told that one day humanity would
have at its disposalall the engines of which it is today possessed
to maintain and defend its material existence, they would have
concluded, ﬁrst, that there would be an augmentation of independ-
ence, and, in consequence, happiness; and, in the second place, a sen-
sible decrease in the competition for the necessities of life. It would
even have been permitted them to think that the simpliﬁcation of
existence, resulting from these perfected means of action, would
bring the realization of higher morality. Nothing of all this has
come to pass. Neither happiness, social peace, nor power for good
increased.—-From W‘agner’s “Simple Life.” Of this book Roosevelt
said: “I am preaching his book to my countrymen}?

WE have carefully examined Commissioner Wright’s re-

port showing the per cent of unemployed in the United
States 5 side by side with his statistical tables We have placed
the observations of trained writers verifying his facts; we
have discovered that the problem confronting the race is the
one of employment—it looms up with the frightful menace
of a derelict wreck in a fog.

We have seen how the American workingman and his
family live. Side by side we have placed Mr. Wright’s ﬁg-
ures and the conclusions of social economists and commit-
tees appointed by‘ capitalist municipal and national officers;
We have seen that one-half of the working population is
unemployed part of the year; that from this condition grows
the misery and degradation of the workingman and his Wife
and children; we have read Mr. Wright’s explanation of
the causes of unemployment, and we ﬁnd them neatly tab-
ulated ; we ﬁnd this unemployment is caused by closed estab-
lishments, slack work, inability to get Work, sickness, etc.
Mr. Wright has not gone back of these “causes.” There
must be a reason Why these establishments are closed, Why

40 Wag/la.nd’s Monthly.

there is slack work, and why men and women willing to
Work are unable to ﬁnd a master.

Does it not seem strange, as the quotation at the head
of this chapter points out, that with the vast improvements
society has made in its productive machinery there should
be such a terrible strife for an opportunity to earn bread?
Let us look into this and see if we cannot discover in the
thing itself the diﬂiculty.

Says the 1900 Census Report, Volume VII., page 123:

A factor that has had a real tendency to lower that actual
average earnings of the wage—earner in many industries is the
displacement of the skilled operative by machinery, which permits
the substitution of a comparatively unskilled machine hand. The
tendency is noticeable in many lines of industry. Its effects are
twofold: to reduce the number of employes producing the same
or an increased quality of product, and hence to lower the total
wages of the group; and to reduce the average rate of wages be-
cause of the lower degree of skill required.

The effect of the introduction and improvement of machinery
upon the condition of the skilled artisan is an economic question
of the greatest importance. Although difficult to show statistic-
ally, the effect can, in some degree, at least, be measured by the
census ﬁgures. . . . In the tanning of leather, by reason of
improved machinery, there has been a constantly decreasing de-
mand for skilled workmen. Women and children are now per-
forming work formerly done by men. In 1890 a “shaver,” who
had to serve an apprenticeship of several years before he became
a skilled workman, received as high as $6 per day at hand work.
In 1900 he had been quite generally supplanted by the “handy
man,” who did the same work by machinery, accomplishing four
times as much, and received perhaps a third of the pay. From
the table it appears that to produce an increase of 18.5 per cent
in value of products there was required an increase . . . of only
6.3 per cent in wages. These statistics indicate thatthe increase
in production has been accomplished very largely through utili-
zation of new and improved machinery without a corresponding
increase in the number of wage-earners and wages paid. . . .
In the boot and shoe industry an increase of 18.3 per cent in the
value of products resulted . . . with only 6.9 per cent increase
in number of wage-earners and an apparent decrease of 2.5 per
cent in wages paid.‘

Again, Volume VII., page 134, of _the report says:
It is stated in the special report on the boot and shoe industry

' that the machinery capacity employed in that industry was suﬂi-

Wayland’s Monthly. 41

eient to produce in seven months of the year all the boots and shoes
for the normal annual consumption.

Now you begin to see what effect the introduction of
improved methods has upon the wage earners and why the
nation is confronted with an unemployed problem.

The politicians and statesmen have been unable to solve
it. ‘They stand aghast at its proportions—increasing swiftly
with each revolution of the wheel of industry.

Shall we destroy the machines? l\To——that would be folly.
It has taken thousands of years of ceaseless toil and the sacri-
ﬁce of innumerable human lives to reach the point we have
on the ladder of progress—and we can take no backward step.
We have seen the hand tool and the individual workman
grow to the great machine and the associated groups of em-
ployed thousands; We have seen this perfected machine
grouped into larger and larger combinat'ions--increasing pro-
ductivity to a point so far beyond the dreams of our fathers
of 100 years ago that, were they alive today, it would appear
to them as a revised edition of the “Arabian Nights.”

As men become familiar with the facts which enable
them to understand the situation———-when they bump up
against economic conditions which put them out of business
or shove them down into the ranks of the unemployed, they
begin to make an effort to solve the problem.

You can see at once that it is not the machine——if you
did not you would desire a return to the primitive times of
your fathers. But you have no serious expectation or hope

~ that the “good old days” will return. You would not ex-

change the passenger train for the stage coach, nor the weav-
ing machine of today for the hand loom.

‘The world would starve to death in thirty days were
it possible to destroy the machinery now used and return to
the primitive tools of a- century ago.

Then wherein lies the trouble? This: The machine
today is owned by the captain of industry and a small group
of his fellows. The increase in productivity goes to the
capitalist, just as a half century or so ago the child born
on the plantation of slave parents became the property of
the master——to be used in producing more wealth.

You have seen from the ﬁgures and the commen s
quoted from the census reports that as productivity in-
creased the number of wage earners decreased, as did like-
wise Wages.

Suppose, then, we take the ownership of the machines
from a few individuals, who absorb the tremendous social
values created, and place the title in the men who use them
——in society in general—and give to each worker his propor-
tion of what he creates. There would then be no surplus-
values climbing up into the millions to be used to club the
working class into misery and want and degradation.

In order to illustrate the difference in income which
would be the lot of the worker under Socialism and his wages
today, I will call your attention to the iron industry.

For your better understanding, I have made two draw-
ings which you will study carefully.

In the diagram, page 42, you will ﬁnd represented by the
black column the progress made in the manufacture of pig
iron. The small black column represents the average number
of tons produced in the mills of the United States for the
year 1870 for each man employed, including superintendents,
clerks, day laborers and skilled mechanics. Note the rapidly
advancing scale, which illustrates the growth of mechanical
improvement and the laborer’s skill in handling the new
machines. For the period of thirty years the table shows
an increase in the ﬁnished product per man employed of
about 600 per cent. To put it in another way———

One man in 1900 turns out as many tons of pig iron
as did six men in 1870.

The light columns show the net proﬁt reaped by the
owners of the mills for ‘each man employed. In 1870 each
workman created a surplus value-—-net proﬁt—of $322. In
thirty years it increased nearly 300 per cent.

In 1870 his wages for making 66 tons of iron were
$453 per year. The next decade, although the product of
his hands increased and the proﬁts of his masters increased,
his wages fell to the pitiful sum of $6 per week. In 1890
he regained the ground lost, but he ﬁrst must add many
millions to the coffers of his masters. The climax came in

44 Wag/land’s Monthly.

1900-the exploitation of that section of the working class
which operated the pig iron plants had Well nigh reached
perfection. Note the length of the 1900 white column, rep-
resenting pm-ﬁts, and then compare it with the column rep-
resenting wages. A study of this diagram will give you a
clear understanding of the operation of the Wages system
under the present arrangement of private ownership.

Now, then, I will ask you to look at the diagram on
page 45.

Here we have the income of the workers and the in-
crease in production. The workers own the machinery»-
they do not “divide up” with the capita1ist—proﬁts have
been eliminated.

There is no unemployed problem, because, with the dis-
appearance of this surplus-value-—-(the difference between
the wages paid and the price of the laborer’s product on the
market)——there can be no overproduction. Each worker con-
sumes wha.t he produces.

Today an improvement in machinery means loss of Work

. to mil1ions—under Socialism it would mean an increase in

the income received by each worker.

It is in your power, as a voter, to complete this new
arrangement. You have the votes—-—a ad for the present at
least you have the opportunity of using them. Tomorrow
it may be too late.

.I urge you, my working class friend, to $1113.’ carefully

clusion——I am willing to leave it to you if you wili '*»r'_: in-

The Prophecy.

AMIES ELLSWORTH, member of the convention which
met in Philadelphia, 1787, to formulate a constitution
for the young republic, uttered these prophetic words:

“As population grows, poor laborers will become so plenty
as to make slaves useless.” ’

I is Fulfillment.

Robert Hunter, in this Year of Our Lord, 1905, says:
“It reﬂects very grievously upon the justice of our

"social system that so many men, willing to work, should be

unable to ﬁnd Work to do. The history of the world has,
perhaps,‘ never shown more abject victims ‘of chance than
the modern propertyless workmen. A man possessing his
own tools or land may always employ himself, and, although
it may at times be necessary for him to sell his products
for a very low price, he need not, except in extraordinary
times, become dependent upon others for relief. The tools
of the modern workman are the machine; both it and the
land are owned by others. He cannot work on the land or
at the machine except by permission of anot'her. If the
owner does not ﬁnd it proﬁtable to employ him, the workman
must remain id1e._ At certain seasons of the year this idle-
ness is compulsory to workmen by the tens -of thousands,
and at times of business depression by the hundreds of thou-
sands. Without savings adequate to supply his needs, and
with his income wholly dependent upon an intermittent de-
mand for his labor, circumstances are apt to arise sooner

Wayland’s Monthly. i. 47

or later that will force him either to commit crime against
property or to depend on public relief for sustenance. If
the state of dependence continues long, habitual paupcrisni
or vagrancy is quite likely to result. In other words, these
outcasts from industry have before them the choice of three
ev1ls——starvation, crime, or relief by charity.”

Jcicob Riis, Friend of Roosevelt, Testifies.

Mr. Biis, in “How the Other Half Lives,” says: “The
reader Who has followed with me the fate of the Other Half
thus far, may not experience much of a shock at being told
that in eight years 135,595 families in New York were reg-
istered as asking or receiving charity. Perhaps, however,
the intelligence will rouse him that for ﬁve years past one
person in every ten who died in this city was buried. in the
Potter’s ﬁeld. These facts tell a terrible story. The ﬁrst
means that in a population of a million and a half, very
nearly, if not quite, half a million persons were driven, or
chose, to beg for food, or to accept it in charity at some
period of the eight years, if not during the whole of it.”

The Capitalist Viewpoint.

In the face of the ﬁgures printed in the foregoing pages which
show pretty conclusively the condition into which labor in this country
has fallen, President Roosevelt in his speech of acceptance in 1904 hands
out the following paragraph composed of four parts hot air and one part
bombast:

“As conclusively shown by the bulletins issued" by the
department of labor, the purchasing power of the average
wage has grown faster than the cost of living, and this in
spite of the continual shortening of working hours. The
accumulated savings of the workingmen of the country, as
shown by the deposits in the savings banks, have increased
by leaps and bounds. At no time in the history of this or
any other country has there been an era so productive of
material beneﬁt alike to workingman and employer as dur-
ing the_seven years that have just passe .”———Rooseve1t.

Freeman or Slave?

A Book of Suppressed Information.

In the Congress of 1776, John Adams observed:

That as to this matter, it was of no consequence by what
name you called your people, whether by tha.t of free men or of
slaves. That in some countries the laboring poor men were called
freemen; in others they were called slaves; but the difference
was imaginary only. What matters it whether a landlord employ-
ing ten laborers on his farm, gives them annually as much as will
buy the necessaries of life, or gives them those necessaries at
short hand?-——From “The Lost Principles of Sectional Equilibrium,”
by “Barbarossa,” 1860, p. 39.

THE following pages are made up very largely from the
“Eighteenth Annual Report of the Commissioner of
Labor,” issued by the United States Department of Labor.
This report is now “out of print”—though at the time I
Write scarcely six months have elapsed since it was issued
from the press of the government printing office.

Many thousands of requests have been made to the de-
partment for copies. These requests have been met by the
department officials with the statement that the “edition was
exhausted and no more copies would be issued.”

The explanation was made by the acting labor com-
missioner, C. W. Hanger, that “there were no funds avail-
able for its reissue.” When one takes into consideration
the millions expended by the United States government, and
the resources at its command, such an excuse sounds child-
ish. It is hardly in keeping with the boasted prosperity

‘I am advised, as this edition goes to press, that the demand for
this government report has been so insistent that a new edition has been
issued. I suggest that you write a postal card to the “United States
Labor Commissioner, Washington, D. C._." and ask for a copy of the
“Eighteenth Annual Report of the Commission of Labor." It is a handy
document to have around.——F. D. W.

Hand and Machine Labor.

The following table is taken from U. S. Labor Bulletin, No. 54.
It is compiled from the 13th Annual Labor Report, which presents in
detail the results of an investigation showing the diﬁerence in time
required to produce a certain number of units of manufacture by the
hand process and by the machine process. The report is out of print.
This table is valuable and should be preserved. With it you can
discover at a glance the difference in the two methods, and you will
begin to understand why the owners of the machines wax rich while
the worker struggles to live. For instance, under the old hand method,
it required 118 hours to make one landslide plow. Today, with mod-
ern machinery, it requires less than four hours. The worker today
produces 30 plows in the same length of time it formerly required to
make one plow. If he worked in the good old days for $1 per day, it
cost his boss about $11 in wages. Today he gets $2 per day and in
eleven days gets $22 in wages. For this outlay on the part of the
capitalist he gets 30 plows. In other words, the capitalist doubles
his wage fund and increases his wealth 30 times——-or, assuming that
plows have decreased one-half in price, he still has wealth 15 times
greater than did his predecessor. The laborer gets for his $2 today
just what his father got for $1———“his board and keep.” Go down the
list and you will grasp the signiﬁcance of the ﬁgures and will know
the secret of capitalist accumulation:

“I do not personally believe that trustworthy statistical sources ex-
ist that enable one to make tables of this character that are more
than mere guesses at the facts. Yet, if it were known what the pos-
sessions of the one hundred and twenty-six thousand richest families
in the United States are the result would be all that any agitator
need ask.” How many liberties have been taken with Mr. Spahi-’s
ﬁgures in order to construct this latter table I do not know; it can
be said, however, that while neither his ﬁgures nor those of Mr. Holmes
have escaped criticism the critics have not, thus far, been able to
make out a case against them which necessitates any material altera-
tion either of the handling of the data or of the conclusions ﬁnally drawn.

A comparison shows that the apparent increase in the proportion

of the unemployed oomprehencls all the main classes of occupations, and

both sexes. Pursuing the analysis to occupations in detail it will be
observed that the result remains the same.

Census, 1900, Vol. “Occupations,” p. cxxvili.

Each of these two census years was a period of rosperity; there-
fore, the economic conditions to some extent were smllar, and it is
reasonable to suppose that accurate returns at the census of 1890 and
1900 would indicate little variation in the proportion of the unemployed
in many callings at least. There are reasons for accepting the ﬁgures of
1900 as more correctly reﬂecting the actual proportions of unemployment
than did those of 1890.——-Census Report, Vol. “Occupations,” page ccxxvi.

“The Most Interesting Phenomenon of the
Twentieth Century.

The following address by Rufus W. Weeks, actuary and sec-
ond vice president of the New York Life Insurance Company, was
delivered at the annual dinner of the Alumni Association of High
School, Newark, N. J. The title of the address was “The Most In-
teresting Phenomenon of the Twentieth Century.”

THAT great movement of which we have seen the beginning
in the nineteenth century, and of which the twentieth
century is very likely to see the consummation, is the up-
rising of the working class. Before speaking of this move-
ment, let me spend a few uninteresting moments in deﬁni-
tions. By the term working class is meant those people
who work with their hands for Wages ; the term, therefore,
does notinclude all Workers, by any means, but only that
largest section of the workers called the manual proletariat,
whom the conditions of their employment force into a poten-
tiality of common feeling and thought, of a common indig-
nation, a sense of common needs, and a sense of power in
common action.

' Other workers have not this potentiality of community-
consciousness; for instance, there are the farmers, the clerks,
the professional workers. The farmers imagine themselves
independent units, and do not know the trick of coalescing
for common advance; the clerks all imagine themselves to
be on the road to be head—clerks or even corporation officials,
and so cannot league together in comradeship ; the profes-
sional worker is dominated by pride in his individual ability
and training, and so he cannot grasp the notion of mutual
help as the main hope.

The working class, then, the proletariat so-called, means
those who are hired in herds, mostly by corporations, and
mostly to work at machines of one kind or another; from
the point of view of the corporation they are simply an ex-
tension of the machine. This very merging of these men

. into the machine throws them into an unity with each other;

4 Wa3,rZmui'.s r":2"«im.»’;I'_: 23;.

of tﬁe nation. But a poor subterfuge is better than none
at a .

The truth is that the report contains information of so
damaging a character against t'he capitalist system that its
votaries would fain keep it hidden from the eyes of the
public——especially that portion of it known as the working
class.

It shows, as does no book of modern times, the abject
dependence of the wage worker upon the capitalist for the
means of life——(a job)—and it shows, too, the utter ina-
bility of the capitalist system to provide steady employment
for more than one-half of the great army of Workers ready
and willing to convert their lives into wealth in exchange
for the food and clothing necessary to maintain an animal
existence. .

President Roosevelt, in his letter of acceptance, referred
to an advance bulletin of this report as evidence of the
“high standard of living” which his administration and the
previous republican administrations had made possible for
the Working class. When the volume itself was issued it
was so at variance with the high-sounding phrases of the

president that word was hastily sent along the line to “bury

the book.” .

If you will follow me through the pages of this little
pamphlet you will understand why the supporters of the
capitalist system did not want Carroll D. Wright’s “Eigh-

~teenth Annual Labor Report” to gain general circulation.

In quoting from other writers to support Mr. Wright’s ﬁg-
ures, I have been careful to select only those who are recog-
nized by the capitalists as authorities. I do this in order to
disabuse the mind of the prejudiced reader, so far as possi-
ble, of any partisanship on my part. V

From these sources I will produce evidence showing—

FIRs'r—That, as John Adams pointed out 100 years
ago, there is no real difference between the laboring poor
man who today Works for wages, which he must spend for
the necessities of life, and the chattel slave who received
those necessities from his master; ‘

Slzoom)-—That, in reality, the condition of the average

it is an education, it teaches the hopelessness of resistance
except by the way of mutual help; and so from guerillas
they are forced to become a phalanx. Slowly, slowly, the
lesson is ground into them, slowly the phalanxes themselves
learn the trick of grouping into an army. An army of re-
sistance, not essentially of aggression; for their effort is to
resist that inexorable, inevitable constant pressure which is
inherent in the capitalist system of production—the pres-
sure by the employing class to get the utmost possible prod-
uct out of the worker for the least possible share of that
product. It is this pressure and the answering resistance
which are called the class struggle; the class struggle, is,
hence, a mathematical and economic fact, though so many of
our pastors and masters unite in pious rebukes of the Wicked
agitator who points out that fact.

BALLOTS INSTEAD OF STRIKES.

Now, what is the weapon with which, thus far, the
working class has been ﬁghting in this war? Only that p()or,
pathetic weapon, ceasing to work, comically miscalled “strik-
ing.” Their own starvation is their weapon, coupled, of
course, with clumsy efforts to enforce the dictates of class
ethics upon those weak-conscienced individuals who shirk the
call to starvation.

But now it is dawning on the mind of the proletarian
giant that there is another weapon handy; we of the “bet-
ter classes” created it for him when we established universal
suffrage, and we put the possibility of the use of it into his
mind when we established universal education. Gifts, these
(the suffrage and education) which having once given we
can never take back. ‘The new weapon is the ballot; and
what will it mean when the working class awakes and takes
this weapon in hand to work out its mind? The ballot

means the whole power of the stat(; courts, police, army;.

and what will happen when ‘the working class ta.kes in hand
all these powers to establish and enforce the idea of justice
innate in its mind?

Even in this country the numerical predominance of
the Working class grows space. The successive censuses tell

Wa-yland’s Monthly. 59

the story in such items as these: The rapidly diminishing
ratio of farm owners to the entire population, the decima-
tion and reduction to powerlessness of the small independ-
ent business men, the deposition of the male clerk by his
sister, and, greatest of all, the enormous increase of the
factory population. The coming dominance of the working
class even here is as sure as mathematics; in Europe it is
already a numerical fact; and twenty years ago I heard
James Bryce say that the drastic use of this power is only
a matter of a few years, being a corallary of the universal
suffrage. The ballot-armed proletariat, awake and aware,
will then be able to work out its purpose. The grave ques-
tion now is: What will that purpose be? i
There is in the world a group of thinkers who think
they know the answer to this question. This group is inter-
national. Its members are most numerous in Germany, next
in France, but increasing now in Great Britain and rapidly
in this country. These men are unsparing analysts, and

inexorable forecasters; they have sounded the depths of the-

self-unconscious proletarian mind, and they have announced
what the will of the working class is to be, as fast as it comes
to its sense of itself. Of course there are critics aplenty in
the cultured classes who handle the conclusions of this group
with all shades of condemnation and contempt; but these
critics are themselves of many and shifting schools, and
amidst them all what alone remains unchanged is the ter-
rible certitude of the Socialists, for by this name is known
the group I mean. -They alone feel they know the future;
none of their critics dare speak with any conﬁdence of an
alternative outlook.

SOCIALISTS AND ANCIENT CI-IRISTIANS.

Standing, as I do, before you, and speaking of the So-
cialist movement, I feel something as a possible ancient in-
carnation of myself might have felt standing before an audi-
ence of cultured and reﬁned persons in Rome at the end
of the ﬁrst century, trying to talk to them of the Chris-
tians. For, as soon as the word “Socialism” is pronounced
the average person thinks of something subterranean, some-

thing fantastic, a mixture of a lovely dream and a dynamic
nightmare; and that is just what the educated Roman
thought of if any one said “Christian” to him. The average
Roman of culture and reﬁnement looked with aversion upon
the Christians as underminers and overthrowers of the ex-
isting social order and institutions, just as today the same
kind of person looks upon the Socialists as workers towards
some cataclysmic horror.

The resemblance goes further. Even as the disrepu-
table Christians were at that moment the potential lords
of the future, so may at this moment be the despised So-
cialists; and for parallel reasons. The Christians had the
future because they were the only set’ of men possessed of
a clear and passionate conviction in the midst of a. tumultu-
ous World of weltering half-beliefs and of cruel selﬁshness;
today it is likely that the Socialists have the future, because
the world of today is a tumultuous sea of half-held beliefs,
and of the cross purposes of the self—seeking powerful; and
the Socialists are "the only compact body of men in sight
who know What they believe and What they are resolved on.

Further runs the parallel; the Christians succeeded be-
cause the doctrine they preached was one which had an irre-
sistible fascination for the masses in the promise it held
out to them of a world of bliss close by, only separated from
them by the easy door of martyrdom ; the Socialists, it seems,
must prevail because their doctrine has an irresistible at-
traction for the masses of t0day——-promising, as it does, a
surcease of sordid struggle——With only one door to pass be-
fore entering upon that better state-——the door of a triumph-
ant election. .

How the history of these times to be Written by and
by Will speak of the Socialists may, perhaps, be guessed
from What the venerable German historian, Mommsen, said
of them a year or two since: “Today this is the only great
party which has a claim to political respect.”

NO PRODUCT; NO INCOME.

Supposing, then, that the Socialists have read truly the
subconscious mind of the proletariat which. is to ﬁx the

Wa.yZand'3 Elf «)::.tri:Zy. 61

ways of the future community—-let us go on to ask what
those ways are to be? What, ﬁrst, is to be the standard
of right and justice? To this, the Socialists say that the
workers’ law will be: “No product, no income,” that every

man must be a producer, or be ‘actually useful to the pros

ducers, or else be scorned and denied share in the product.
One puff of the giant’s breath will blow away all that ﬁne
mechanism of law and business through which we now mulct
the product of the worker on all sides under such guises as
rent, interst, profit, fee and salary. The only citizenship
held honorable will be economic citizenship--comradeship
in production and in the sharing of product.

If in this attempt to read the social mathematics of
the times I have read aright, it appears that the working
class are to be our masters! Let‘ us hope they will be good

,to us. After all they will demand no more of us than the

Northern states demanded of the Southern——to come in an.d
be one with them on equal terms. We of the “cultured?’
and business classes will have to go into the game on the
new condition—the condition of being useful to the work-
ers—or else will have to get out of the game. In the latter
case we shall, of course, have to get oﬁ the ground where
the great co-operative machine is working. I see in fancy
the bulk of us shipped to some island—-clerks, ministers,
professors, storekeepers, bankers, lawyers, insurance men, spec-
ulators, gentlemen all——and there, without any producers to
make a living out of, trying to get salaries or proﬁts out of
one another.

This discussion ought to be summed up in a conclud-
ing deﬁnition; but Socialism is a living phenomenon, and,
like all live things, eludes deﬁnition. A live thing can be
viewed at so many differnt angles, and, besides, it changes
so insensibly from moment to moment, that to sit down
and make an all-around deﬁnition of it is a task nearly
hopeless. The militant movement of today known as Social-
ism I should deﬁne from the point of view of this present
treatment as follows:

62 Wag/land’s Monthly.
MILITANT SOCIALISM.

Militant Socialism is the attempt to formulate the sense
of justice and the will of the working class; further, it
is the doctrine that that will ought to be, and must be,
and will be, the scheme of life of civilized mankind in the
near future. The humble origin of this doctrine makes it
hard for the educated classes to grasp its intellectual wor-
thiness; and the seeming fact that the doctrine is against
the interests of the educated classes makes it hard for them
to see its moral worthiness. Hence not many of the edu-
cated can be counted on to rally around the standard of
Socialism; and here again we may ﬁnd a close parallel with
the early days of Cliristianity. It was said then: “Not
many wise men, not many mighty, not many noble are called;
but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to con-
found the wise; and God hath chosen the Weak things of
the World to confound the things which are mighty; and
base things of the world, and things which are despised,
hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
nought things that’ are.”

The record of the Gospels, especially the Gospel of_
- Luke, suggests, to those who will read it over without bias,

a view of the Carpenter of Nazareth very different from the
traditional view. There are many such students who hold
that he was a thorough going proletarian, and that one large
section of his religion has been ignored from the start by
the ecclesiastical machines which have claimed to represent
him, and that the social justice and universal brotherhood
which he proclaimed can come only as a sequel to the up-
rising of the working class.

The next question we ask of the Socialists is how this
ﬁne canon of justice is to be put into action—-—in what Way
is industry to be carried on? The answer of the Socialists
is that that will be the affair of the experts who will have
it in hand when the time comes. The proletariat, familiar
with machinery and with its exact sequence of effect‘ from
appliance, reverent also of science, will entrust to scientiﬁc
men the direction of its processes, precisely as now do the
stockholders of a corporation. There is now developing in

Wayland’s Monthly. 63

various parts of the world—notably in England and Bel-
g1um——_a science of co-operation, which is producing a corps
of specialists in that best and ﬁnest of all sciences, and an

army of workers disciplined in applying it. And it is to

such trained hands that the task will be entrusted of replac-
ing our present‘ antiquated, clumsy, indirect processes of pro-
duction and distribution by a simple direct process.

At this point it is likely that some one is thinking,
“A moment ago you called our present system a ﬁne mech-
anism and now you call it a clumsy process.” Well, it is
either—-—according to the point of view. As a machine for
abstracting from the worker the largest possible share of
his product——mainly in insensible ways—it is a marvel of
ingenuity and eﬁectiveness, while, on the other hand, looked
at with regard to its economic function, its contribution to
human welfare, its only true reason for eXistence—which is
the production of the largest possible volume of useful com-
modities and the distribution of these commodities as widely
and as evenly as possible——-it is a rude and clumsy machine.

The experts in co-operation whom the dominant prole-
tariat Will place in charge of affairs will certainly abolish

this absurd system; their problem will be to devise, or rather

discover, the new, direct, co-operative process. It will also
be their task to arrange the transition from the old to the
new with such precision that no disastrous jar shall inter—
vene. The case is like that of replacing an old railroad
bridge by a new—as we have seen it done here in Newark;
the new bridge built and ready, but the trains continuing
to cross the old on schedule to a certain moment of_ a cer-
tain day, when the new is slipped into place, the old drawn
away, and the trains run on Without stop or delay.

American workingman is Worse than was that of the chattel
slave in the United States before the civil War;

THIRD—~That the state of unemployment is the inevita-
ble result of and necessary to the maintenance of the capi-
talist system of production ; ,

FoURTH—~That so long as" it (the capitalist system)
continues the condition of the Working class will steadily
grow Worse.

These four propositions I will prove by the Words and
evidence furnished by the supporters of the system it'sel.f.
I Will then prove to you, my plain, practical friend, that
only by the establishment of the Co-operative Commonwealth
on the ruins of the competitive capitalist system can the
condition of the wealth producers of the nation be improved.

——Page 42, 18th Annual Labor Report.

IS there an unemployed army composed of men and women
who are Wil1ing——yea, anxious—-—to work Who can ﬁnd no
one to employ them? ,.

The average man Will dismiss the question with little
consideration. If he happens to belong to that group of
Wage-earners, comprising 50 per cent of the Working class,
constantly employed, he may tell you there is a job for
every man willing to Work. On the other hand, did he
belong to that other group, comprising 50 per cent of the
working class, employed part of the time, his answer would
doubtless be entirely different.

Waylcmd’s Monthly. '7

If you ask this question of a politician belonging to
the dominant party, he will dismiss it with a wave of his
hand and tell you that in this Wonderful land of prosperity
there is plenty of Work, and to prove it he Will quote from
the February, 1904, issue. of the National Maga.zine, pub-
lished at Boston, the words of the late Senator Hanna:
“There are two jobs for every man.”

But do the facts, as disclosed by your personal expe-
rience and observation, backed by the ofﬁcial ﬁgures of your
government, bear out these optimistic and careless state-
ments? ’

The most important contribution made by Commis-
sioner Wright to the economic literature of the nation is
his “Eighteenth Annual Labor Report.” It is label.ed the
“Cost of Living and Retail Prices of Food.” The investi-
gation, however, covered a larger ﬁeld. In it We ﬁnd care-
fully compiled the earnings of the American workingman,
his Wife and children. More than this, it shows the state
of employment and of unemployment, and the causes of
the latter condition. It is with the unemployed problem
I Will deal in this chapter.

In the preface of his report, page 11, Mr. Wright, in
order, doubtless, to impress the reader with the thorough-
ness with which the ﬁeld had been covered, says:

Inasmuch as the families canvassed were distributed over thirty-
three states, and the proportion in each geographical division corre-
sponds very closely to its importance in an industrial sense, and
owing to the large number of families investigated, selected with-
out reference to industry, it is believed that the data here given
relative to cost of living are fairly representative of the conditions
existing among the wage workers of the whole country.

“There was a disposition,” continues the report, “on
the part of the families visited to give exact information,”
and “While individual statements may not be absolutely accu-
rate, it can be safely assumed that averages based on any
considerable number of statements correctly represent the
group of families from which they were secured.”

Mr. WI-ight’s conclusions, based on his investigation, in
which he was aided by the resources and prestige of the
