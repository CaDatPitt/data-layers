Convention Scales
Mountains of Work

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

SAN FRANCISCO———That tired-looking fellow who arrived back on the job the
other day got that way by working hard. If you ask him, he’ll probably tell you he’d
never work that hard for the company; he ’d tell them to jump in the lake first. He was
working for himself part of last month, however—for himself and every member of

the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers.

For our wearylad was a
delegate to the 54th con-
vention of Mine-Mill which was
held March 16-21 at the Belle-
vue hotel here. There were 200
like him. They manned com-
mittees and bargaining coun-
cils. They debated and dis-
cussed and they Wrote and wor-
ried. They listened to seem-
ingly interminable reports, to
a flood of greetings from pub-
lic officials, to a speech here
and there, to resolutions, an-
nouncements, amendments,
and nominations.

DIFFERENT

If Mine-Mill’s San Francisco
convention were to be de-
scribed with a single word
that word would be “work.”
Every delegate seemed to know
that this would be a different
kind of convention the minute

_ he_ arrived in town. Some of

‘The earlier arrivals, called to
meetings of chain bargaining
councils, were hustled into ses-
sions their very first morning,
on March 20. From then on
they worked and worked hard.

The usual complement of
guest speakers was taut dras-
tically this year. The schedule
wo11ldn’t permit them. The
chief speaker invited to ad-
dress the delegates was Harry

- Bridges, colorful president of

the International Longshore-
men’s and Warehousemen’s
union. (Story on Page 11).

Participating in discussions
around the lead-zinc situation
were Charles A. Murray, ad-
ministrative assistant to U.S.
Senator James Murray (D.,
Mont.) and Robert Redwine,
assistant counsel for the Sub-

SAN FRANCISCO—-A king-size package containing
collective bargaining gains ranging from substantial Wage
increases to a comprehensive job security program was
unanimously proposed here on March 20 by more than
200 delegates attending the 54th Mine-Mill convention.
Easily the most eagerly-awaited resolution in the con-
vention, the union’s list of demands for 1959 negotiations
was a distillation of local union resolutions from all sec-
tions of the country, as well as recommendations of the
International Executive board and the Various union
bargaining councils. ‘

The companies employing Mine-Mill members “have
recovered from the effects of the recession” and “our
members have not experienced a similar recovery,” the
convention unanimously declared, i11 adopting the report
of the Wage and Contract committee. The delegates said
flatly: . . . “this is the basic impalance that we will seek
to adjust in this year’s bargaining.”

In" fact, the delegates concluded, “the gap between
our earnings and what is required to maintain this (Amer-
ican) standard of living . . . has been consistently widen-
ing over the years.” -

Proposals contained in the now-official union’s bar-

tion which brought a new local of some 300 Kennecott  i               

workers into Mine-Mill.
Mine-Mill topped the combined vote of both the

Chemical and Steelworkers
unions by nearly two to
one. It was another solid
demonstration of copper work-
ers’ preference for a copper
workers’ union.

The key victory meant not
only the addition of another
new local to the family of 10
now ‘comprising the Arizona
Mine-Mill council, but even
more importantly represented
one more organizational link
further strengthening the four-
state Kennecott council within
the Mine-Mill framework.

Workers at Kennecott’s Hay-
den mill and sponge iron and
acid plant voted March 11 as

DENVER——As the Mine-Mill Union went to press, Vice-
President Asbury Howard was still serving time on a prison
work gang in Bessemer, Ala., which resulted from his activities
in urging Negroes to register for voting. His case had reached
[the highest appeals court in Alabama and was awaiting action

ere.

Meanwhile, in response to an appeal from the union’s In-
ternational officers, protests and pledges of support for the
courageous Negro civic leader and trade unionist were pouring
in from all over the United States and other parts of the world.

Among the protests were those from the American Civil
Liberties union ; a number of AFL-CIO and independent unions;
Yehudi Menuhin, world-renowned American concert violinist;
the Malayan Trade Union council; the J apanese_g_‘Miners «union;
Norma_ng’..l__’T_‘h>giriwa,§; Dr. Jerome Davis,’*'?ai“1itl‘1or; English coal

tee on Constitutional rights to conduct an investigation of
Howard’s imprisonment and his prior beating by a mob of

to have bail accepted or to get released. ...-'

'I -No. 929 in an arbitration deci-
’—‘ sion handed down March 23,
Local 929 President Cenobio
y‘ Robles announced. The case
and brief for the union were
handled by Regional Director
Jack C. Marcotti.

Arbitrator Lawrence R.
Guild, professor at the Univer-
sity of Southern California, or-
dered Local 929 member Wil-

' lie Lopez restored to his job
with full seniority rights and
~ back pay for time lost to
‘February 15. The arbitration
victory meant back pay for
about six and a half weeks for
 Lopez, amounting to nearly
"’i_«~,$700.
5 The company had contended
 that Lopez, working on the
graveyard shift, was “negli-
‘ gen ” and had caused an acci-
dent in the sand line by sleep-
fing during a period when he
should have been attending to
his duties. The union argued
that he was not remiss in his
duties, that it was customary
for him to eat hislunch away
from the assigned work sta-
tion when his duties permitted,
that he had not overstayed his
allotted time for lunch, and
that he had violated no rule.

In his brief, Marcotti also
submitted a unanimous ruling
-of the Arizona Security com-
mission which held that L0-
pez was not discharged for
just cause.

The arbitrator’s award de-
clared that
sleeping on the job has not
been established with suffi-
cient certainty’-’ and held that
the firing was “not justified.”

William Hayes, a leader of
Mine-Mill Local 415 in Carls-

Mexico State Mine Inspector.
Hayes thus becomes the sec-
ond Mine-Mill local leader to
win such a post in an impor-
tant mining state. George D.

job of Idaho state mine inspec-
tor in the November election.

Buffalo

Members of Buffalo, N. Y.,
Local 813 unanimously rati-
fied a new one-year agreement
reached March 19 with Ni-
agara Falls Smelting & Re-
fining Division of Continental
Copper & Steel Industries pro-
viding for a total package in-
crease of 10 cents an hour.

Included were: 7 cents
across the board, raising aver-
age straight base wages to
$2.30 hourly; 21/; cents addi-
tional on shift differentials, in-
creased to 10 and 121/; cents;
sick and accident benefit of
$60 a week for 40 weeks per
illness or accident starting
with first day of accident and
fourth day of illness, with
company paying all premium
insurance costs; removal of all
strings (cost limitations) on
entire comprehensive insur-
ance program, meaning the
company now will pay all
costs (current and future) on
life, hospitalization and surgi-
cal-medical insurance as well
as for the new sick and acci-
dent benefit; resolution of all
outstanding grievances plus
several contract improve-
ments. -

Although the contract is ef-
fective April 1, wage increases
were made‘ retroactive to
March 23. Int‘l Rep. Joe Scioli
headed the committee con-
sisting of Local President
John .Quigley, Chief Steward
Carl Cawthon, Vice President
Arthur Nickerson, Recording
Secretary Viola Lingswiler and
localeofficers Ralph Hubbard
and Sam Mushat.

Tacoma

Members of Local 25 at
AS&R’S. Tacoma, Wash,’ smel-
ter, idled since March 13
by a plant shutdown over in-

creasing company abuses of‘

their contract, voted ‘unani-
mously March 27 to reject
terms -of a management back-
to-work proposal. More than

-400 of the union’s nearly 700

members were present at the
special meeting called to con-
sider the company’s offer.

The union has termed the
shutdown a “company-created
lockout.”

Local 25 secretary Elmer
Olsen said the offer was re-
jected as “totally unaccepta-
ble” by the membership. It
required that normal plant
production precede discussion
of the problems causing the
dispute. “This would mean,”
Olsen said, “that Local 25
president Floyd Martin, six
members of the grievance
committee and two other mem-
bers would remain discharged
and other grievances unset-
tled. Our members refused to
return to work on that basis.”

The plant was ordered closed
March 13 when the local re-
fused to halt stop-work meet-
ings called mainly to protest
indiscriminate warning slips
issued by management for al-
leged violation of company
rules. The union maintained
there was much confusion re-
garding the warning slips, the
second of which called for a
three-day suspension. M 0 r e
than 300 employees received
three-day
March 1.

Notifying the company of
the membershp’s unanimous
action in rejecting manage-
ment’s back-to-work offer, the
union further proposed that
the parties use the U. S. Me-
diation and Conciliation serv-
ice as_ a means of resolving
the dispute. This service aided
in settling the lock-out at the
plant in 1950.  ‘

president of Local 509; Juan Arunda, Jr., of local 509; Hasso, and Alfredo Montoya, El Paso businessf 
agent. Lucille‘ Reese of the convention office staff accepts Hasso’s credentials.  ‘

EL PASO, Texas—El Paso-born Manuel G. Hasso, Mine‘-Mill Local 509 leader at 

 

the AS&R smelter here, last month won a four-year, union-backed fight to retain 
United States citizenship against efforts of the Immigration service to denaturalize and"

deport him to Mexico.

Both the original order that Hasso be denaturalized because he allegedly had voted’-

in a Mexican election and
subsequent decision of the
District court in Washington,
D. C., sustaining the order

were reversed March 5 by the '

Circuit Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia which
ruled unanimously that the
evidence against Hasso was
insufficient. . *

Denaturalization would have
been the step ‘prior to deporta-
tion.

PULLED OFF JOB

Hasso, at the time vice presi-
dent of Local 509, was work-
ing day shift at the AS&R
plant on June 13, 1955, when
Immigration agents pulled him
off the job and placed him in
jail Where he was kept until
released on $1,000 bond put up
by the local union.

He was originally accused
of having voted in an election
in Mexico, having been em-
ployed by a foreign govern-
ment (Mexico) and having
evaded military service, but
the latter two charges were
later dropped.

Local leaders saw a connec-
tion between the timing of
Hasso’s arrest and an effort to
influence the NLRB election
scheduled two days later at the
AS&R smelter‘ where the

Steelworkers union was raid-'

ing Mine-Mill. His arrest, of
course, received headlines in
As
it_ turned out, however, the

Steel-raid was overwhelming-

 

ly defeated in the balloting at
which Hasso himself, out on
bail, was a _Local 509 ob-
server.

At the first Immigration
administrative hearing held in
El Paso in February, 1956,
where Hasso was defended by
local attorney Joe Calamia,
the presiding special agent up-
held the order denaturalizing
him on the charge of having
Voted in Mexico.

APPEALED

His case was then appealed
to the Immigration Board of
Appeals in Washington which
also upheld the denaturaliza-
tion order, and again to the
Washington Dis tric t court
which, too, ruled against Has-
so. In each case the defense
argued to no avail that the
government could not support
the charge on the basis of al-
leged prior self-admissions
which Hasso denied and with-
out additional independent
proof.

The unanimous decision of
the three-judge Circuit court
confirmed that position, re-
versing the Immigration Serv-
ice and District court. Hasso
was represented at all the
Washington proceedings by at-
torney Joseph Forer in con-
sultation with Mine-Mill Gen-
eral Counsel Nathan Witt.

From the very beginning of
the denaturalization, proceed-

ingsi Hasso.  the {only 1 per; ..

son who gave evidence. His’
testimony wasinterpreted as
amounting to an admission on '
his part that he had voted in -
an election in Mexico. A citizen
who votes in a foreign election
thereby forfeits his citizenship.

INSUFFICIENT

The rule in criminal cases,
however, is that a defendant‘ 
cannot be convicted on his own’, i
uncorroborated admission. Th -
decision of the Circut Court ‘of’ : .
Appeals in favor of Hasso de-1 *
clared that this same rule“
should be applied in denatural-
ization cases. Since Hasso was
the only witness, the court
held that the testimony was
insufficient because it was un-."
supported by other evidence; .

Forty ' years old, married 5 I

two daughters, Manuel G. Has-
so remains a U. S. citizen. De‘-“
spite the long harassment, he
is still a very active ‘Mine-'2

section, and acting on amend-
ments proposed in the report
of the convention's Constitu-

tion committee, the delegates"

by convention action directly
approved a host of minor lan-
guage changes in procedural
matters designed to increase
the efficiency and economy of
the union’s operations without
encroaching on basic demo-
cratic guarantees traditionally
invested in the membership.
Among the adopted revi-
sions, deletions and additions
werethose dealing with: defi-
nition of International execu-
tive board; election of can-
vassing committee alternates;

definition of length of term of

office; duties of the Interna-
tional executive board, its pro-
cedure for convening meet-
ings, and redefinition of its
authority as a board of adjust-

; ment; method of submitting
monthly financial reports; du-

ties and responsibilities of In-
ternational executive board
and staff members; publica-
tion of the Union newspaper
and maintenance of the news-
paper mailing list.

OTHER CHANGES

Other adopted changes dealt
with: duties and privileges of
unemployed members; an en-
tirely new article on retired
members, their duties and
privileges, and honorary mem-
bership cards; uniformity of
membership identification
cards; rules and regulations
concerning travel cards; pro-
curement of supplies from the
International union; consolida-
tion of local unions; duties of
local financial secretaries,
trustees and other officers;
and other local procedures.

All delegates were provided
in advance with complete
mimeographed texts pf’ the
proposed changes prior to the
committee’s report and discus-
sion and action on each sec-
tion by the convention body.

Most important of all, how-
ever, were several proposed
major amendments which the
convention recommended and
approved for submission to
referendum vote of the mem-
bership on May 19. These will
appear on the ballot in the
form of four propositions on
which the rank and file will
vote yes or no.

PROPOSITION N0. 1

The first proposition would
add a new Article 4, Section
12, to the constitution. This
section is a new clause defin-
ing the eligibility of local
unions to participate in Inter-
national elections or referen-
dums and have their votes
counted by the canvassing
committee. It provides that
local unions “must be in good

standing in accordance with

Article 14 and have paid per
capita up to and including the
second (2nd) month prior to
the month in which the elec-

. V tion is held.” I ..  ,

Candidates in Two Contests

_ . o present members of the International Execu-J“
tive board WI" have been re-elected without opposition. To fill the vacancy in the office of secretary,-~

treasurer left by_ the resignation of Albert Pezzati, Board Member Irving Dichter of District 6 (left) was
nominated to succeed him. He is being opposed by lnt’l. Rep. Charles Wilson (secondfrom left). Vet-

eran Board Member Chase Powers of District 7 (third from left) ‘is being opposed by James Buck of Selby,’

Ca|if., local No. 5l (far right). ‘

PROPOSITION NO. 2
Proposition No. 2 would

amend Article 6 dealing with .

recall of officers. This entire
article is rewritten and speci-
fies trial by the International
Executive board and referen-
dum.

Spelled out in nine sections,
the amended article provides
for petition for recall of Inter-
national officers by 25 percent
of the membership from 25
percent of the local unions,
and for trial by the Interna-
tional Executive board. The
Executive board’s fin din g s
would be submitted ‘to referen-

. dum vote. Ballots in such ref-
erendum would be required to
contain the charges made and
the findings. of the Executive
board.

PROPOSITION NO. 3

This proposition would
amend Article 14, Section~4(a)
to provide authority for the
International Executive board,
in the case of an emergency,
to levy assessments not to ex-
ceed a total of six dollars
($6.00) in any calendar year.
The amended article would
read as follows:

“The Executive Board of the
International Union shall have
the authority to levy assess-
ments, in case of emergency,
not to exceed a total of six
dollars ($6.00) in any calendar
year. When an assessment is
levied, all local unions will be
responsible for the number of
members in good standing for
the period in which the assess-
ment is levied.”

In the past the Executive
board has been empowered
under the constitution to levy
assessments not exceeding one
dollar in any calendar year.
It is to be noted that only two
such assessments have ever
been levied by the Executive

board in more than the last
15 years.
PROPOSITION NO 4.
Proposition No. 4 would add
a new Article 26. This new
article would retain the pro-
visions for amending the con-
stitution as adopted in the
1958 referendum. In‘ addition,
it would provide for a new
procedure for submitting is-
sues to a referendum vote of
the membership by the Exec-
utive, board. It would also
clarify the duties of the Can-
vassing committee elected -at
each convention. The new ar-
ticle would replace -present
Article 7, Section 17; Article
26; Article 27, Section 1; and
Article 28. 6
Fuller and more detailed ex-

A resolution adopted by the

convention pledged “the total

his -unconditional freedom, his-

constitutional rights, and of

furthering the cause of free- I

dom and democracy in Bes-
semer, Ala., and elsewhere

that American citizens strug-
gle against Dixiecrat tyranny,

and for constitutional rights.”
The resolution urged Mine-
Mill officers to call for labor
unity around the “task of de-
fending the Constitution as
interpreted by the U. S. Su-
preme court, and removing
Dixiecrats . . . from the po-
litical life of our country.”

What Is the Most Important
glssue in ’59 Negotiations?§

§ Delegates tothe San Francisco Mine-Mill convention to a man placed wage
increases at the head of this year's bargaining demands. in an effort to learn
what other issues were uppermost in the minds of delegates. The Mine-Mill
Union reporter interviewed many of them. Their sometimes surprising replies

are contained on these pages. Each delegate was asked the same question:

"What issue do you believe is the most important in 1959

contract negotiations?"  

K/\/\,

 

ARMAND M. NAVARRO, L0-

cal 700, Los Angeles, Calif.:«
Job security. We’ve got to.

show the companies in such

places as El Paso and Tacoma
that we’re ready to fight and
beat back attacks againstour
jobs and contract conditions.
We will win our just demands
for decent wages and working

conditions with a united rank '

and file. . _

ARNOLD ROJAS, Local 586,
Miami, Ariz.: Most important
to me is bringing about an ex-
tended health and welfare pro-
gram for our members and
their families. The next thing
is the elimination of the wage
differentials and inequi-
ties that exist throughout the
industry; inside plants, be-

tween plants and from one
-area“ to another.

SEVERIANO “CHANO” ME-
RINO, Local 890, Bayard,

must stick together and fight
for a substantial wage in-
crease. Also to improve the

of’, our health .’and' welfare

 

  
   
    
     
   

  

 

OTTO Gnoss, L 0 c al 124,

Ruth, Nev.: _We need complete.

dependent insurance coverage
and intend to get that in our
negotiations this year. Our

‘health and wel,;"""..»re problems

  

are of great concern to all the
members of our community.
Of course, there are other im-
portantissues, but to my mind
health and welfare tops them
all. — . .

 

DAVID VELASQUEZ, Local
616, Morenci, Ariz.: In bar-
gaining this year we must
provide for guaranteed job se-
curity and other safeguards
that will maintain our wages
at least at the same level‘ as
the continuous increase in pro-
ductivity and the rising cost
of living. All the evidence
backs up the justness of our
wage and contract demands.

JOHN J. RAPUANO, Local
445, Ansonia, Conn.: I know
everybody says it, but I want
to emphasize that the main
issues are a substantial wage
increase plus revision of our
contract structure to strength-
en our grievance procedure

do something about the un-

When it comes right down to
it the only real way to solve
the problem is the shorter
work week without reduction

unite to fight - for. .Wage in-

are also high on the list.

DOMINICK DEL VECCHIO,

ing after 10 years, removal of
strings from holiday clauses,
and a general improvement of
all economic issues, plus a
shorter work week demand.

 

ALFREDO AYALA, Local 509,
El Paso, Texas: This year we
should see that all the weak
la n -g u a g e in our contracts
be straightened out and
strengthened for our best pro-

ROBERT BEY, Local 758, Chi-

JOHN HENLEY, Local 314,
Wrigley, Tenn.: To my mind
there are several main issues
we have to concentrate on
about as equally: wage in-
creases, improvement of

health and welfare insurance
and pension plan, and getting
together with all other unions
to make a fight for the short-
er work week that’s more nec-
essary now than ever before.

NICK YENGICH, Local 485,
Bingham Canyon, Utah: Sure
there are main issues like
wages and fringes, but in my
opinion there’s nothing more
important than contracting-out
of our work which has been
going on for years. That’s got

to stop. The company must be
made to live up to the con-
tract they sign with our union.

 

PAUL POLETE, Local 809,

Fredericktown, M0,: Job se-
curity and those items stem-

ming therefrom are the main '

issues. Out of negotiations this
year must come a much tight-
er control or penalties on com-
panies which knowingly and
willingly cause violations of
our contracts, and resulting
piling up of grievances to cor-
rect them.

   

PAUL KRILICH, Local 25, Ta-
coma, Wash.: Two basic goals
make this year’s negotiations
important to all Mine-Mill
members: 1) securing ade-
quate wage increases to sus-
tain a decent standard of liv-
ing for our members and their
families; 2) getting proper
guarantees under our con-

_tracts to protect our. working

FLOYD C. LOEWE, Local 618,
Bonne Tel-re, Mo.: Due to the
decline in markets, speed-up
and increased mechanization
replacing men —— all causing
layoffs and unemployment_ es-
pecially in our industry —- I

think job security should be a
major issue in this year’s bar-
gaining. A lot of our people
can't see that the recession is
over.

 

JOE RUZIC, Local 729, Staten
Island, N. Y.: In our local un-
ion the main issues in the next

contract negotiations will be

premium pay for Saturday and
Sunday work as such, plus
correcting and tightening up
the language in the contract
clauses to take care of prob-
lems arising from department-
al expansions instituted by the
company.

LOUIS CHATMAN, Local 735,
Cleveland, Ohio: What's been
happening to our health and
welfare program is that we’ve
been losing out -by higher doc-
tor and hospital charges what
we gain in negotiations. We’ve
got to improve this health and
welfare setup. *Also, besides
a good wage ‘ increase, we
should go for a shorter work
week. i

 

JAMES EDWARDS, Local 870,
Savannall, Ga.: Higher wages,
of course, com e first. .They
are needed and justified. Then
to take care of unemployment

THE PROGRAM

Following is a summarized version of the Unioli’-Vs.
proposals as adopted by the convention: ‘ ‘  » L?-T

 

to be applied equally to all classifications within existing wage
structures. _ 
WAGE INEQUITIES—We further propose to work toward '
our objective of achieving a fairer and more uniform wage
structure for this industry——-one that will wipe out both ,inter}"
nal and geographic inequities——through a two-step approach; 
Step 1—Realign the internal branch and plant wage; L
structures. . - 3 ..
Step 2—Eliminate geographic differentials, raising all
rate structures to at least Utah-Nevada standards. - ’ »
We believe that the first step of this approach can be sub-
stantially realized in this year’s negotiations, and that beyond;
that, a time schedule and program for completing the s,ec'o_nd
step can also be negotiated. .
We further propose that all agreements provide for regular ;
review and negotiation of all changes in job content—in- addi-“
tion to such negotiations as may take place upon the introduc-
tion of new machines, processes or methods of operation.-"Wei
propose that such reviews be made at not less than six_-month-.._l
intervals and that, in the event of disagreement, the Union have "
the right to submit all such disputed cases—in one batch-*-to:
binding arbitration. .  V T
COST-OF-LIVING ESCALATOR CLAUSES——We. propose-
that all contracts include clauses providing for automaticiad;
justments in wage._rates whenever the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics shows accumulative increases equal to or exceeding one "C
point since the last wage adjustment. ' ' ' t V ‘

CONTRACT BONUSES AND INCENTIVE SYSTEMS74
Wherever contract bonus or incentive systems are in .effect‘,,
bargaining demands covering the following basic principles,’
where they have not already been adopted, should be presented!
in this year’s bargaining: ‘ 

a) The right to negotiate prices per foot or toll or what-,
ever the unit measure is. . .,

b) Setting of normal standards based on the amount. of
work performed by a typicalworker not on incentive, with*a-ll" ,'
work above normal to be paid for at not less than the normal 
rate per unit of production." V L 7

c) Prompt grievance procedure on contract bonus issues‘ "
with the right to arbitrate. . - : '
d) Proper integration of all wage increases into bonus sys- A.
tem. . ‘ . L “
e) Adequate servicing for all contractors with delays_due,t,o
inadequate servicing not to be charged against the contract. E g ..

f) Coverage of indirect workers (such as haulage and serv-_, 1:
icing workers) under some form of incentive when the amouI_lt'"---
of work performed by such indirect workers is affected by_
contract work. _ - - ,  v ’

, PREMIUM PAY’ FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WORI_£‘g-_~ 5.}:
—All contracts should provide for time and one-half pay for C 
all work done on Saturday and double time for work done on 
Sunday with the additional provision that work be scheduled so‘ ~ 
that all days off he on a consecutive basis. ' ‘ ' T ‘

More resolutions were introduced on the shorter work week
than on any other issue before this committee. ‘ I .

SHORTER, WORKWEEK—Millions of workers are today.
unemployed, in spite of the recovery that has occurred, because
of technological changes. ‘ , — j ..

The trend toward substitution of machines for men in this?” " 
industry——in boom times as well as in recessions—has been un L
mistakable for many years. The recent sharp contraction of 
jobs in the non-ferrous industry brings a new urgency to this j
issue. We propose again this year to raise the demand for a  
shorter workweek in all negotiations. ,_.

Our demand is for a reduction of the normal workweek
to a maximum of 32 hours with no cut in take-llome pay.

The realization of this demand will require action beyond
the bargaining table, in our communities, an_d in the halls of .
State legislatures and the national Congress. All locals should ‘ ~
initiate the widest possible joint activity with other unions for
the shorter workweek. .

SUPPLEMENTARY UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND, _. ~i
SEVERANCE PAY—The general demand for supplementary 
unemployment benefits should be raised in all negotiations '[lll'£fT\ ’
year. Such a demand should call for a supplementary unem
ployment benefit plan that will (a) provide benefits supple ‘ ‘
menting -State unemployment compensation up to 80% of take
home pay for 52 weeks in cases of unemployment, and also
(b) supplement regular earnings up to 80% of take-home pay
whenever actual earnings, because of shorter workweeks,‘ fall
below that level, and (0) provide severance pay of one week for
each year of service for workers permanently laid off froln
their jobs. -

JOB TRANSFERS——Where men are laid off because of the
shutdown of all or part of an operation while other operations
of the same company are either expanding or starting up, laid
off employees shall have the right to transfer to the -new or
expanding operation with no loss in seniority rights for pur-
poses of pensions and employee benefits. Where work is moved
from one location to another, the union shall continue to rep:
resent the jobs in the new location. Contract standards shall
be applied to new operation. , _ .V

MEDICAL BENEFITS——-The committee endorses‘ recom- ,
mendations contained in the President’s report for greater em-
phasis on securing hospital and medical care on the most eco- T
nomical -basis. A determined effort must be made to secure
hospital-medical-surgical benefits. on a direct service basis,"
through agreements ‘Withrgroups of doctors and/or hospitals.*~ .
Insurance company —. plans which usually provide only partial 
reimbursement of incurred expenses should be considered only .,
in the absence of direct’ service plans. - _ _ _ .  - 7

U. S. Jobless Pay
Called Obsolete

SAN FRANCISCO—Federa1 unemployment compen-
sation standards were characterized as “seriously . obso-
lete” in a convention resolution which urged they be
brought up to date as quickly as possible.

Specifically, the statement adopted by the delegates;
called for:

O Enactment of the Murray-Kennedy bill providing
for uniform 39 week duration of unemployment compen-
sation benefits, increased benefits to 50 percent of the
worker’s earnings up to two-thirds of the state average
wage, and other improvements.

0 Enactment of legislation to establish federal stand-
ards for administration of state public assistance pro-‘
grams, authorizing federal grants in aid to the states on
a matching basis for public assistance, and broadening the
distribution and improving the quality and quantity of
surplus agricultural commodities.

The resolution noted that enacted amendments to state
unemployment compensation laws “have been miserly both
as to size and duration of benefits” as compared to pro-
posed legislation for higher and uniform federal stand-
ards. At the same time it said the bill recently passed by
the House to continue payment of temporary supplemen-
tal unemployment compensation benefits through June
30 of this year “is inadequate to cope with the mounting
problem of unemployment” since too few the people in
need would benefit by the extension. ’

Because of the increasing number of unemployed who
have exhausted all unemployment benefit rights, the reso-
lution also urged support for the formulation- and enact-
ment of a legislative program, based on present studies
by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, for
federal standards governing the administration of all
forms of public assistance, and the distribution of surplus .

While the bill’s provisions
fall short of the goal of
2,000,000 new housing units

slum dwellings and provide
for the nation’s growing pop-

“It would prevent the de-

H's a Democraﬁc   nion

In these days of Kennedy, McClellan, and otheI'_detractors of labor unions, their charges

of “diota.toI'ship” and “machiiies” and “rule from the top” fall on disbelieving ears in the

ranks of the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. On thi' page are pictures of just a few of

the delegates to the union’s 54th Convention who took the floor to speak their minds on‘

a wide variety of subjects. Here is a. good cross-section of “theimen who run Mine-Mill.”

   f  Chief Clark
Report Item

. SAN FRANCISCO —— “The
most pressing task of this 54th
3 convention will be to see to it
that the current sh a rp up-
‘ turns in production and profits

3‘  have their counterpart in an

upturn in jobs and take-home

pay,” President John Clark

told 200 delegates to the Mine,

Workers
1 convention here.

The leader of the non-fer-
rous metal miners union in the
United States and Canada, in
his annual report to the mem-
bership, declared: “We were
instrumental in stopping the
bust in the industry; now it’s
‘our turn to share in _the
boom.”

“Preparation of the union’s

bargaining program for 1959,
he said, “is the most important
issue facing this convention.”

.In an all-encompassing analy-
sis of the present state of the
industry, Clark made the
point that the companies have
recovered from the worst ef-
fects of the metals crisis. But,
he added, “our members have
not experienced a similar re-
covery, and this is the basic
imbalance that we will seek to

3 adjust in this year’s bargain-
ing.”
EVIDENCE

The Mine-Mill president de-
tailed considerable evidence to
underscore the fact that non-
ferrous metals industry em-
ployers are steadily increasing
[their mine production and con-
sequent profits with fewer and
fewer workers on their pay-
rolls.

" “Copper mine production,”

- he said, “is now fully recov-
ered and current output is at
record or near-record levels.”
While this branch of the in-
dustry has recalled about 2,500
men since the low summer
months of 1958, he continued,
“it is operating with about
7,000 fewer workers today
than were employed two years’
ago.

“This means far greater out-

put per rnan—an increase in.

productivity that has been
achieved by layoffs, speed-up,
job elimination and frequent
contract violation. This great-
er productivity has paid off in
copper corporation p r o f i t s
which are shooting upwards
at a rate which promises to
approximate, if not exceed, the
record profits made by the in-
dustry in 1956.”

Chief among the bargaining
objectives he listed was “an
increase in take-home pay”
which, he said, “is both neces-
sary and justified by many
considerations.”

INEQUITIES

A program for the elimina-
tion of wage inequities in the
industry was also proposed by
Clark as a basic guide on this
major issue in negotiations.

Reiterating that the union’s
demand for a shorter work-
week without loss of pay is
still very much an issue, he
termed this approach “the
most effective means for cre-
ating jobs in our industry”
while at the same time stress-
ing that its realization will re-
quire an all-out struggle by
all unions.

In a review of the union's
political activity during the
November elections, Clark
said that “the real story of
Mine-Mill’s political success is
found in the election results in
the counties and towns where

our -union’s membership is
-rnore concentrated  . We de-
livered the votes.” He called

for “post-election results in the
formof national and state leg-
islation” to. insure against “the
practice of losing in the halls

-  Convention
- .Wants Civil
-Rights Drive

SAN FRANCISCO—At least
five resolutions approved by
‘the International Union Con-
. vention here dealt with the
«Si  continuing fight to guarantee
" - and extend the civil rights and
liberties of all Americans.
' Destruction of hopes that
strong civil rights legislation
would follow the Democratic
party victories at the polls was
deplored. “Only a widespread,
2 organized campaign for genu-
 ine civil rights legislation
"\ could force the Democratic
'— majority in Congress to hon-
or their campaign promises,”
one resolution declared.

It called on the International
and local unions “to support
-and organize activities th a t
will bring the maximum pres-
sure to bear upon Congress
and the Executive office for
legislation and administrative
action to assure fair employ-
ment practices, anti-lynch and
anti-poll tax legislation, fed-
eral funds for education to
non-segregated schools onl_y,
an end to segregation in pub-
lic housing, and special mea-

 sures through the use of all
facilities of governmentto pro-
vide equal rights for the Ne-
.-gro people and other minori-
ties.”

A _ MORALITY

Naming “equal rights for
all” as “the central moral is-
sue of our times,” the conven-
tion urged support of a pe-
tition campaign and Youth
Rally in Washington, D. C. on
April 18 being sponsored by
several leaders of the AFL-CIO
and many prominent liberals
to protest President Eisenhow-
er’s silence and lack of lead-
ership on the segregated school
issue. _

In this connection, the dele-
gates backed enactment of

3 S810 and HR 3147 providing
for a -positive. program“ of
school integration and empow-

,1 ering the Attorney General to
enforce Federal law. Also.

 urged. was extension of the
 term of the Civil Rights com-

, mission for another two years,
-and liberalization of the Wal-
ter-McCarran Immigration
law.

The Supreme Court of the
United States was lauded for
having “rendered many im-
portant decisions in recent

 

.5;

years advancing and protect- *

ing civil liberties,” [While

strong opposition was record-

ed against certain congression-

al efforts to “wipe out the fine

interpretations in the de-

1 cisions of the Supreme court.”

__.Terming the high court “the

- single most important bul-

  warjk of the - liberties of the

. .American people,” the dele-

gates went on record condemn-

mg “broadside attacks” on the

Kggcourt as “a disservice to our
democracy”

regulation is far more fancied 
than real” and that “the pic-
ture painted by the McClellan
committee of the operation of ,. V.
the labor movement is a dis- i‘“7‘
tortion” since “only a small

percentage of the trade union
leadership is involved in rack-
eteering and gangsterism.”

The union charged that “in be {_
practically every case, -such‘ 
racketeering exists because of“ .-
collusion between racketeers
and management. Manage-
ment in such cases tries to buy
soft unionism at the expense
of a decent labor agreement
for their employees.”

HEAR BRIDGES

The resolution was adopted
before the delegates heard 
blistering attack by Long-
shoremen’s Union President.
Harry Bridges against the top
leaders of the AFL-CIO. He
charged that they were “more
concerned with the whole mess
of reform and their respecta-
bility than with the growing
problem of unemployment in
the country.” , ’

“I know some of these re-
formed sinners,” Bridges said,
“and I know their holier-than-
thou attitudes. I can’t help
wondering when some of these
reformers themselves were re-
formed — including Mr.“
((}eo1'ge) Meany.”

The colorful leader of the
west coast dockers’ union said
that the “American labor
movement should be doing
other things; it should not be
relegating to third or fourth
place the simple matter of
finding jobs which troubles 
millions of American working “
men and women.”

(‘JAG’)

Bridges, in typically blunt
language, also described “an-
other jag” of AFL-CIO offi-
cialdom. “Al Hayes (president
of the Machinists union), the
ethical practices boy,” he said,
“is showing much concern
over the use of call girls by
the American system of free
enterprise. Here he is attack-
ing one of the oldest opera-
tions of free enterprise. As I
found on my recent trip
abroad, the poorer the coun-
try the more prostitution you
will find. At any rate, Al
Hayes doesn’t seem to support
full employment for even the
call girls.” /

The Mine-Mill delegates had '
urged during the same con-
vention session “that labor call —
for an investigation of man-
agement practices leading to
collusion to deny workers
their democratic rights to or-'
ganize, .to engage in political

Convention Pledges Vigorous
Defense of Union's Leaders

SAN FRANCISCO——Defense of the union through defense of its leaders under
legal attack was once more vigorously pledged by the convention delegates. _

Occupied as they were with the main task of the convention to prepare a bargain-
ing program for this year’s negotiations in all major sections of the industry, the dele-
gates unanimously adopted a resolution placing the convention “on record as giving

to the defense of our Union

who come under anti-union
attacks.”

The rank and file represent-
atives also called upon “all
local unions to continue their
efforts to mobilize the mem-
bership for the Union’s de-
fense.”

“Our International officers

and other leaders of our Union _
-are still faced with the prob-

lem of defending themselves
in court actions brought on by
the attacks of anti-union ele-
ments,” the resolution de-
clared.

INJURY TO ALL

It called attention to the
fact‘that “this is an open at-
tempt to destroy our Union
by depriving us of our leader-
ship” and pointed out that
“our members have always
understood the nature of these
unjust attacks and reacted in
the traditional Mine-Mill prin-
ciple of ‘an injury to one is an
injury to all’ ”.

In reaffirming support of
the union’s elected leadership
the delegates responded to

sentiments expressed earlier’

by President John Clark both
in his opening remarks and in
his annual report to the con-
vention.

' CLARK SPEAKS

Clark described the issue in
a nut-shell when he said:

“The past year has strength-
ened our contention that pend-

ing legal actions against the

Union can be described only
as the left-over rubbish of the
hysterical, witch-hunting past.”

_Referring to the re-opening
of the SACB hearing after it
had been lying dormant for a
year and a half, Clark re-
marked: “It is significant that
it is being revived when the
Union is about to enter nego-
tiations again.

He called the “conspiracy”
charges against 14 past and

present 0 f f i c e r s and staff

members a “legal hangover
from the distant past”- and

- confidentially predicted “com-

plete vindication of the Union

and the leaders who have been
accused so wrongfully.”

Union Sees

is New Hope

For Peace

SAN FRANCISCO—A strong
plea for peaceful negotiations
among nations to settle the

9,»:-/‘”<lifferences between East and

West was incorporated in a
54th Mine-Mill convention reso-

lution which warned that “an- r

' ' other general war would mean
suicide of the human race.”

The statement pointed out
that, “despite an almost uni-
versal desire for peace, aworld

. war could be triggered at any
,"-‘fz moment through an accident
or a rash decision of a military
man on either side,” and add-
ed: “Regardless of the origins
and history of the cold war,
its continuance
able.” .
’Hope for an end to the cold
 ar and its accompanying
C . danger of a shooting war was
seen by the delegates in com-
ing meetings of foreign min-
isters and heads of state
which, they said, “offer an op-
portunity for the beginnings
of an adjustment between the
East and West, a way of liv-
ing on the same planet with-
out the constant threat of hor-
rible death for millions on
both sides.”

FLEXIBILITY

Expressing “a d e s p e r a t e
concern for the future of our
children and grandchildren,”
the convention r e s o l u t i o n
called for a flexible foreign
policy and urged the heads of
government “to negotiate with
all the skill and patience at
their command, to find formu-

  

 

-~/."‘.‘rlas for mutual withdrawal

from areas of friction, to end
the awful threat hanging over
mankind.”

The views of some spokes-
men.f_or-certain sections of big
business, and even of the la-

bor movement, who oppose an s

end to the cold war ' on the
grounds it increases demands
for goods and sustains employ-
ment and living standards,
were termed “unfortunate”
and “shortsighted.”
 “As working people who
. yield to none in our desire for
 full employment,” -the Mine-
Mill convention delegates de-
clared, “we say it must be
achieved through production
for peace, not through an in-
sane balancing on the brink
of war. Full employment-
not the partial employment we
have at present —— could be
reached through construction
of badly needed schools, hos-
pitals, housing, roads, plants
to produce atoms for peace.”

The expressed conviction of
a growing number of business
and congressional leaders that
we should accept the offers of
“nations on the other side of
the cold war” to trade with the
U. S. was endorsed in the res-
olution, which pointed out that
mutually. beneficial foreign
trade “tends to lead toward
peaceful .relations” and “cre-
ates jobs for American Work-
ers.”-

MEANINGLESS

On this point the resolution
added: “The old fear of ‘aid-
ing the enemy’ through trade
has becomemeaningless in an
age when each side has enough
destructive power to depopu-
late the globe.” It urged “re-

 ciprocal trade wherever it will

" be of mutual benefit . . . in

the interest of peaceful rela-
tions and full employment.”

The resolution, contending
that peaceful economic compe-
tition would benefit the people

‘,2!’

on» both sides, declared: “We.

have the greatest productive
plant, the greatest number of

A -skilled and trained workers in ’
- . history. We have’ -nothing to 1

Tl-HIE MINE-MILL UNION

 

SECRETARY-TREASURER ALBERT PEZZATI, left, is applauded T by Washington Representative Herman Clott,

master of ceremonies, and President Clark after latter had presented a wrist watch to him. Pezzati is
retiring from office to live in New York. The presentation was made at convention banquet. 

Pezzati Reports Progress
:1 Financial Stabilization

SAN FRANCISCO-—Tangible progress in the stabi-
lization of the union’s finances was described by Secre-
tary-Treasurer Albert Pezzati in his annual report to the

54th convention. This advance, he said, was accomplished
in the face of adverse conditions in the industry which

took a heavy toll in jobs
and union income.

“The impact of the metals
crisis had its effect on the fi-
nancial condition of the en-
tire union as well as in all
other areas,” Pezzati told the
delegates. “The local unions
suffered in most cases a de-
cline in membership and con-
sequently of income, and the
International Union shared in
the financial problems that
were brought about by the
shutdowns and general cur-

tailment throughout the in-
dustry.”
STRIKE

Furthermore, he said, the
total decline in revenue from
U. S. locals was compounded

Tribute to Howard

SAN FRANCISCO—A spe-
cial message from Int’l. Vice
President Asbury Howard, on
an Alabama work gang, was

delivered to the 54th conven-‘

tion by delegate Jesse Gaines

of Bessemer, Ala., Local 109,

who then paid tribute to

Brother Howard as follows:

Let earth withold her goodly
roots,

Let mildew bright the rye;

Gtve to the worm the orchard
fruit,

The wheat field to the fly.

But let the good old crop adorn

The hills whereon our fathers
trod.

Still let us for men like As-
bury Howard

Send up our thanks to God.

. by a considerable reduction of

income from Canada due both
to the change in per capita to
the U". S. voted in 1957 and the
3-month Inco strike late last
year. These factors added up
to significantly less income
for the union’s General Fund
in 1958 than in 1957.

. Nevertheless, Pezzati said in
his last report as Secretary-
Treasurer to a Mine-Mill con-
vention, “despite the falling
off of income during this 
ficult year, I am glad to re-
port that -the International
Union operated at a net gain
for the year.”

Energetic measures were
needed to make such a favor-
able showing, he said, describ-
ing economies which made the
saving possible. These includ-
ed reduction in general staff
and district expenses as well
as necessary cuts in staff. The
move into the International’s
headquarters building and es-

tablishment of the union’s

own new Addressograph mail-
ing system were also listed as
measures which helped to
make the operating expenses
of the organization more eco-
nomical.

PROGRESS

“Thus, in spite of the disad-
vantages entailing from the
metals crisis and the depres-
sion in the industry, the Union
was able to show organization-
al and administrative progress
and at the same time to in-

crease its total income for the

entire year,” Pezzati said.
He reminded the delegates,

however, that while this rec-

ord of financial stabilization is .

all to the good, it still is based
on “very moderate resources”
typical of the union over the
years. He called for the ac-
cmnulation of a reserve big
enough “to meet all contin-
gencies” as well as to sustain
organization and expansion
programs.

Pezzati concluded his report
with a tribute to the “forti-
tude and imagination” of the
local union officers and Inter-

national‘ office clerical staff '

Whose hard work, faithful
service and cooperation, he
said, “has been a major factor
in maintaining a solvent and
efficient organization.”

Sorry!

We have tried to give a
resume of the entire 54th Con-
vention at San Francisco in
this issue. Some convention
news has to be eliminated-
and many photographs. In ad-
dition, this issue does not con-

‘ tain many of the regular fea-

tures we’ ordinarily carry each
month. Much local and ‘re-
gional news’ has been omitted,
despite our increasing this
post-convention issue of the
Mine-Mill Union to 16 pages.
In subsequent months we will
attempt to give fuller details
and explanations of the con-
vention program, including es-
pecially the May 19 referen-
dum and the 1959 collective
bargaining program. We’re
sorry if some item you expect-
ed to see has not appeared.

Resolutions 
Cover Many
Questions     

SAN FRANCISCO--Ap_-.
proximately 100 resolu-
tions submitted by the Inter‘
national E x e c u t ive board,
councils and locals comprised
the framework in which the
54th convention evolved the
program and policy of the
union for the year 1959. These
resolutions, stripped for actio,
by the various ‘conventi
committees, c 0 v e r e d a Twid .-
range of issues from the Ina:
jor concern with imminent-
bargaining and union detail’
to the longer range view of
foreign affairs. .

In all of its actions the ._ con-.-.
vention laid the basis for an‘,
educational and organizational.
program that will increase
Mine-Mill’s prestige, and ex.
pressed this idea in a resolu-.';
tion calling for expansion of
the union’s potential member-
ship both within our jurisdid
tion already under contract
and through continued organi-
zation of the unorganized. Q.‘

PROGRAM

To further this end an in‘-
tensified educational program__
was called for to train local‘
officers as well as rank and.
file members for leadership‘ in‘.
union affairs and to eliminate.
the apathy which keeps many.
members inactive. The Inter.
national Executive board‘ was :
further instructed to proceed
with a project “forithel publi
cation of the History and
Background of our great i In‘
ternational Union.” . ‘ ‘L 

On another issue, the - dole
gates emphasized the common
interests of all industrial
workers with working farmers
and farm labor for higher -pay-.-
in both industry and agricuf
ture, in stable and justifarmp
prices, and in the observation
of the traditional America}?
system of independent, family
operated farming‘. S — 

Noting that adverse develop‘
ments are threatening these
interests, the convention
called for reversal of the
trend toward substandard _e  _
ployment and wage conditions ‘

Existence of a no-raid pact
among AFL-CIO internationals
evidently did not prevent the
Steelworkers from violating it
in their move against the
Chemical union. As for the
workers themselves, they
proved they desired neither

Considerable significance was

circles since it climaxed the
first in a series of organiza-
tion campaigns currently be-
ing conducted by Mine-Mill
throughout the state, especial-
ly in Miami and Bisbee, and
which are expected soon to
culminate in NLRB elections
involving a variety. of AFL-
CIO unions.

HISTORY

Originally, the Kennecott

-‘mill and sponge iron and acid
_ plant workers belonged to an

AFL Federal Labor Union 10-
cal which represented both
Hayden and Ray prior to the
time that the Ray workers
chose Mine-Mill as their bar-
gaining agent in 1952. The
question of union representa-
tion become somewhat con-
fusing for the workers at the
Hayden mill end of the Kenne-

‘ cott operations when the AFL

merged with the CIO national-
ly and mandatory discontinu-
ance of Federal Labor Union
Locals became a matter of

:f>%~._\_\ time.

- emizona AFL-

CIO regional office moved to
dissolve the Hayden FLU lo-
cal and itself conducted an
exclusive election in which the
only choice on the ballot was
between the Chemical and
Steelworkers unions. Out of

some 300 workers involved

only about '70 voted, and of
this minority the Chemical
union won. Shortly thereafter
the picture became even more
confused by top level AFL-
CIO preparations to merge
the Chemical Workers with
the Oil Workers union.

Just what union would rep-
resent them in 1959 bargain-
ing with the Kenncott Copper
corporation was the question

DeIeg_ates Call Steel’:
tkaiding Employer Boon

SAN FRANCISCO——CQndemnation of the Steel-
workers union for its “union-busting, anti-labor” raiding

was urged on all labor by the de

vention resolution.

This year as in the past, the resolution said, “the

raiding Steelworkers union
is preparing to lend aid
and assistance to our employ-
ers during negotiations by at-
tempting to raid our union.”
The resolution continued: ‘

“Although the membership‘

of Mine-Mill and other unions
will, as they have in the past,
reject and destroy this re-
peated attempt bySteel to dis-
rupt bargaining, it is time
that the labor movement rec-

ognize the damage being done ‘

to the trade unions of America
by the Steelworkers union.”

“It is time for all of labor,”,

the resolution went on, “to
condemn these raids as union-
busting, anti,-labor e f f o r t s ,
and that the responsibility for
this attempted sabotage of the
non-ferrous workers’ collective
bargaining be placed where it
belongs——on Dave McDonald
and the leadership of the Steel-
workers union and all who
support and aid them.”

Both the AFL-CIO 'and all
other international u n i o n s
were urged to “condemn and
expose the Steelworkers union
wherever the Steelworkers are
attempting a raid in our indus-
try during this crucial period
of negotiations.”

sions ran a half day longer
than usual, with the conven-
tion scheduling its first Sat-
urday proceedings in several
years.

CONTRACTS

The overriding cause for an
agenda stripped of all save
hard work was the impending
June 30- expiration date of
Mine-Mill’s major contracts in
the nonferrous metals indus-
try. Evgry delegate was aware
that the 54th convention would
have to concentrate for many
hours and days on perfecting
a collective bargaining pro-
gram for spring negotiations.
From President John Clark's

- opening remarks to his clos-

ing, the convention was de-
voted mainly to gearing. the

union for the rapidly ap-_

proaching day when its com-
mittees seat themselves across
the table from company ne-
gotiators in the most wide-
spread bargaining sessions
since the three-year agree-
ments were signed in 1956.
The President's report con-
tained the judgment of the
union’s leadership “that the
upturn has come and that the
profits of the non-ferrous met-
als companies also are stead-
ily climbing.” The ‘delegates
were advised that "‘the most

pressing task of this 54th con-'

tion will be to see to it that
the current sharp upturns in
production and profits have
their counterpart in an upturn
in jobs and take-home pay. We
were instrumental in stopping
the bust in the industry; now
it’s our turn to share in the
boom.” ,
CONSTITUTION .

This was the first conven-

.tion, too, to amend the union

constitution in any way by.

strictly convention action. On-
ly those proposed changes
dealing with clauses on fi-
nances, election of officers,
and others affecting the basic
democratic structure of Mine-
‘Mill will be sent to a referen-
dum vote of the entire mem-
bership on Tuesday, May 19.
Minor language changes and
alterations not affecting fi-
nances and democratic guar-
antees were amended by the
convention this year as au-
thorized in a membership ref-
erendum following the Denver
convention last year.

Among the principal propo-
sitions sent to referendum this
year is the authority of the In-
ternational Executive board to
levy emergency assessments
not to exceed $6 in any calen-
dar year. The proposal was
adopted by the convention to
provide some of the antici-
pated necessary financial am-
munition for this year’s bar-
gaining campaign. In the
words of the Wage and Con-
tract committee, as adopted
unanimously by the conven-

tion, “the drafting_ of a pro-.

gram at this convention is
only the first, although an ex-
tremely important, stage in
bargaining.” The convention
declared further that:

“There are the further tasks
of educating our membership
and the public, particularly in
our communities, on the jus-
tice and significance of our de-
mands and then of taking all
other necessary steps to in-
sure the full preparation and
support of our membership
for whatever action may be
necessary . . . And this year-
more so than in any recent pe-
riod—we will need the neces-
