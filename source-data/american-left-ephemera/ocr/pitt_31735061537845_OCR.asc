VIOLA JUBACH, MOTHER OF TWO SMALL CHILDREN, FOR HAVING ACTED
AS ‘A SPOKESMAN OF A COMMITTEE DEMANDING WINTER CLOTHING
FROM THE CUYAHOGA COUNTY RELIEF ADMINISTRATION
FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE MARTIN FAMILY.

The Martin family, at the time, was facing eviction.
The C C R A, as a solution, had given them a list of ﬁve
over-crowded hovels unﬁt for human habitation. Two of

these were in a “red-light” district, the other three were

in the “ﬂats” from where comes more juvenile delinquen-
cies than any other part of the city.

The Martin family had been refused winter clothing.
For six weeks the Broadway oﬁice had refused to see a
committee elected to intervene for them. Then one day
at the Martin home, Mrs. Jubach, for the committee,
spoke sharply to the “snooper” Miss Newman. For this
your neighbor, ‘Mr. Roy, Ereckson, ﬁnds Mrs. Jubach
“Guilty of blackmail”, and would send her to the peni-
tentiary for ﬁve years.

Mr. Roy Ereckson has chosen sides. He is on
the side of the “decent people” the prosecutor spoke
about; the detectives, the bankers, the “secret seven”, the
organized group of exploiters who use every legal trick and
unscrupulous act to cut the amount of relief provided
the unemployed— not only to save two-thirds of the tax
money for the Wall Street bankers, but also, by starving

' the unemployed, use them as a whip over the employed

to cut wages.

Let Mr. Ereckson ﬁnd his friends and associates
among this class of "decent people.”
Van Sweringens, the Morgans and Rockefellers for com-
pany. But maybe, although he served them well, they will
look upon him merely as a servant, and not as an equal.

Meantime, if Mr. Ereckson’s dream of sitting pretty
with the millionaires fades, let him listen and he will
hear the cry of little children. William Jubach, two years
old last week, toddling and stumbling from room to room,
crying endlessly——calling for Mama. And there in the cor-
ner sits three year old Helen Jubach—— tears will not come
any more— empty-handed, dry-eyed— she wonders, but
cannot understand, why her_ mother does not come home.

Maybe, in the ﬁve and one half hours that the jury
was out, Mr. Ereckson was not leading in the argument

to ﬁnd Mrs. Jubach guilty. Maybe, down in his heart,
he was opposed to it, but gave in to the frothings of a
professional labor hater and red-baiter wormed onto the
jury. Maybe he let himself be hamstrung by the shrewd
arguments of the prosecutor and the ceremony of the
court so that he forgot the purpose of a jury. Maybe he
forgot. or never knew, the reason our forefathers fought
for the right to a trial by jury, was to do away with legal
technical frame-ups and give justice to the oppressed.

But it is in this way that frame-ups against active
leaders in the ranks of labor is carried out. Tom
Mooney is still in ~jail—although every one of the jurors
who convicted him said before they died, went crazy, or
committed suicide, that Mooney was not guilty.

The unemployed have to organize to get adequate
relief. The employed have to organize to get decent wages
and working conditions. A drive is being made against all
working-class organizations. The Chamber of Commerce,
nationally and with its “Secret Seven” locally, bring pres-
sure on city, state, and national ofﬁcials to carry out .a
reign of terror to make the country safe for them to
exploit the workers. Anything that would limit their
proﬁts and greed is called “subversive.” You may be next
to be called on a jury to do their bidding, or confronted
with one for ﬁghting for your rights. In this event,
remember that for one who consciously betrays the salt
of the earth, the backbone of the country, the only useful
class, the working-class in the struggle against its oppres-
sors, workers everywhere have nothing but contempt.

Every day that the Jubach children cry for their
mother, branded a criminal, languishing in jail, the jurors
should know that their neighbors hold them in utter scorn
and contempt. .
