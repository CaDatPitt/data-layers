BURNING CARDS  

AND      
FLAMING VILLAGES

By JAMES E. JACKSON

Editor of THE WORKER

  ADMINISTRATION is swinging its two-handed
propaganda sword high and low, hither and yon, and aiming
it at every critic of its Vietnam war. Every newspaper and
magazine of the Establishment has mounted a broadside

against the several young paciﬁsts who have demonstrat- ,

ively burned their draft-cards in protest against the Govern-
ment drafting the young generation into the armed forces
for participation in the senseless slaughter which the U.S.
military is carrying out in Vietnam.

The violence of the indignation which the press and
TV are pouring forth upon the heads of those youths who
burned their draft-cards is matched only by the ecstatic
accolades which these high priests of propaganda give to
describing the incendiary work of the Air Force’s B—52’s.
The press abuses the conscience-burdened objectors to War
for burning their draft-cards but lauds the B-52 pilots for
napalmaburning human beings, for the jellied gasoline torch
ﬁres they are making of the homes and the bodies of men,
Women and babies of Vietnam.

These days a large number of junketing Congressmen
are going to Vietnam to Witness the sport. It appears that
the “in” thing in Washington’s VIP circle is to have feasted

on LBJ barbecue in Texas and to have feasted one’s eyes
on the dead bodies of Vietnamese‘ people after they were
barbecued by the ﬁre of napalm bombs dropped upon them
by US. bomber pilots. V

When I read of the dastardly reports of these p-ilo-ts
I recall the savage exclamations. of sadistic exaltation
which Mussolini’s son used to describe the carnage he
wrought on a bombing mission over Ethiopia in 1935. He
Wrote of a “brilliant multi-colored spectacle of the bombs
bursting amidst the thatched villages, With ﬂames leaping
to the sky and the blacks running to their death, their

bodies ﬂaming like torches . . . how this display of the power -

of our air force thrilled me!” I
Will the civilized people of the World today think kinder

of our (U.S.) bombardiers over Vietnam than I thought of

Mussolini’s son? I don’t think so. ‘

This criminal War of aggression which Washington
is Waging in Vietnam has opened up a sharp contradiction
between the draft-age youth and the Government. It is -also
producing an ever sharpening conﬂict between the ranks
and the command in the armed forces themselves.

Pigs are for barbecuing over charcoal ﬁres, not human

beings. But our planes, dropping napalm bombs, are con-
verting homes in Vietnam into funeral pyres and people in
Whole families are being_burned to death.

It surely must have been the contemplation of such
features of the horror and injustices of the mission of slau-
ghter-without-honor upon which they were ‘being sent which
led four Negro citizen-soldiers to go on a hunger strike in
protest against being compelled to go to war against the
Vietnam people. These Negro youth are members of the air-
born U.S.A. 1st Cavalry Division. (Although Negroes are
only 10 percent of the total population, they are 20 percent
of the-_1st Cavalry Division —- a ﬁgure equivalent to the
ratio of unemployment among Negroes in the United States.)

The Army administered a swift drumhead courts mar-
tial verdict on these young soldiers who put demands of their
conscience and sense of humanity above the orders of their
military commanders to “kill or be killed.”

Private Percy L. Green, 24, of Chicago was thrown
in the stockade for ten years at hard labor. Harold Brown,
22, of Stanford Fla., was sentenced to two years at hard
labor. David Clark, 26, of Co-ral Gables, Fla., also received
a. two year sentence and 21-year-old Johnni L. Jackson was

.25..»-

given a six months sentence. All were heavily ﬁned and
ordered to be dishonorably discharged at the termination
of their prison sentences. — '

When the war in which you ﬁght is a criminal war, a e

savage War of aggression, a napalm-house—*burning war
against civilians and soldiers, then everything has a re-
versed value. Four courageous Negro lads who dared to sep-
arate themselves from this cannibal-style ritual of napalm-
barbecuing of human be-ings are counted as cowards and
traitors and "imprisoned. While pilots sailing through the
heavens unleash tons of penetrating jellied ﬁre-death upon
the heads and bodies of children, of old people, of mothers,
and of youth, While such pilots are decorated as heroes.
Yes, this is the essence of your war, LBJ; a war
which it is the bounden duty of every American citizen,
before God and history, to do everything in his or her
power to bring to an end! ‘

Given such awar, the only just ﬁght is the ﬁghtifor % i
peace and for the defense of those who are victimized in A 

the ﬁght for peace.
