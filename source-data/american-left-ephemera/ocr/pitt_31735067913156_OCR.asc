Top Officers Unopposed;
October Referendum Set

DENVER, Colo-—Tl1e three top Mine-Mill intern'a— L

tional officers--Al Skinner, president; Asbury Howard,
vice—president; and Irving Dichter, secretary-treasurer—
were nominated for additional terms by acclamation on
Aug. 20, winding up the union’s week-long 59th convention
at the Albany Hotel. The nearly 200 delegates who at-
tended spent the five days hammering out a forward-
looking program in the areas of bargaining, organization,
union finances, defense in the “conspiracy” case, legisla-
tive and political action, and civil rights.

Skinner, in his speech accepting the nomination for
his second two-year term as president, stressed the
achievement by Mine-Mill since 1963, when all of the top
offices were hotly contested, and during this convention
of a “unity of action . . . that tackles problems and drives
through to achievement.” “Unity,” which he called “the
most used and abused word in the American labor move-
ment,” doesn’t mean the absence of disagreement, he said,
but a commitment to the program adopted to benefit the
workers. *

Executive board members from three of the union’s‘

districts also will stand for re-election without opposition,
while two others have races

and Sundays, even though it is
not overtime work.

Allied Smelting was organized
by Mine-Mill in April, when all
of the workers in the small plant
voted for the union in an NLRB
election. The union won a sec-
ond election in Milwaukee‘ on
June 17 at the Mid-City Foun-
dry, which employs some 120
workers.

Company charges protesting
the conduct of the Mid-City elec-
ticn were dismissed late in Au-
'gust by the Regional Labor Re-
lations Board, thus giving Mine-
Mill certification as bargaining
agent at that property.

Executive Board Statement

Labor Day . . . 1965

Eighty-three years ago, in May, 1882,~a resolution was passed by the Central labor ‘Council
to establish the first Monday in September as a labor holiday in New York City. 1 ' ,

At the 1884 convention of the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions in Chicago
a resolution was introduced by Typographical Union No. 16 which said:

“Resolved, that the first Monday in September be set apart as a laborers national holiday, i
and that we recommend its observance by all workers, irrespective of sex, calling, or national- 
ity." It was passed unanimously. _' V A  , _.

It was ten years laterin 1894 that Amos 1.’ Cummings, a union man and a New York Con- ’
gressman, introduced a bill in Congress to establish the first Monday in September as Labor
Day and a national holiday. _It was adopted by Congress onjlune 28, 1894, and signed the same
day by President Cleveland. ‘ ' , 1  _

‘THE ‘ MINE-MILL UNION

Delegates Call for Increased
ctivty in Civil Rights Fight

The immediate removal from office of Los Angeles Police Chief William H. Parker

was urged on Aug. 17 by the delegates to the 59th Mine-Mill convention, who later in

55 4.  the week approved a lengthly civil rights resolution calling for the use of “extraordi-

nary means if necessary” to break the “vicious circle of discrimination and disillusion-

’ ment, frustration, and despair” existing today in the United States.

‘.1 Parker, charged the resolution _on the riot-torn California city, has “for many
years indulged in sadistic brutality against the Negro community.” Unanimously

- passed after receiving floor support from several delegates including Vice-President

 Asbury Howard and Secretary-Treasurer Irving Dichter, it stated that the convention

delegates, “like all Americans, are deeply shocked and horrified by the events in Los
Angeles in recent days,” but maintained that the country has been moving “too

Kséowly to remedy the evils

3 iought by oppression and dis-

ff; ffimination against the Negro

people.”
‘ Commending President Lyn-
don B. Johnson for his un-
derstanding that the recent dis-
orders—not only in Los Angeles,
but in other cities as "well-

H stem from “unjust conditions,”
5 the resolution urged the Presi-
- dent, California Governor Ed-

'-fmund G." Brown, and Los An-

-. ’/geles'Mayor Sam Yorty to em-

“liark at once on a massive pro-

t (gram to remove the underlying

causes of minority group dis-
satisfaction -— “unemployment,
wretched and segregated hous-

_.ing, inhumane welfare policies,"

and ' deprivation of elementary
‘human and constitutional
rights.”
, Asking Brown and Yorty to
remove Parker and appoint a
successor who would revamp
.. the city's police department so

°that it would serve “as a true»
. protector of the lives, the prop-

erty, and the rights of Negro
citizens and all others in the
th e convention
said that Parker had shown “in-

» credible gall” in blaming the
’ current disorder on civil rights
—...demonstrations and what Park-

er termed “coddling of the
_Ne_groes.” '
- Can Prevent Rioting
“When we stand together,”
said Dichter, in urging support

._*_for.the re-solution, “we can pre-
vent the occurrences of Los
« Angeles. The struggle elevates

»us all.” Robert Kiever, presi-

dent of Local 480 in Trail, B.C.,

T Killed in Fall

g KELLOGG, Idaho -- Eli
g;-Beachel was killed on the
afternoon of Aug. 18 at the
close of his shift, when he
slipped and fell 165 feet in
the American Smelting and
' Refining Company's Page
jmine. A long-time employee
" of the company, he first went
to work in the old Frisco
mine. He worked at the
Morning mine for a period,
and for the past 11 years had
been at Page. 
 -“Beach," as he was known
go his fellow workers, was an
" tstanding member of Mine-
‘ ill" Local 18, the Coeur
"d’Alene District Miners’ and
,Smelterme’n’s Union. He had

and, more recently, as a
"grievance committeeman. C ‘
 Highly regarded as a stead-
fast champion of workers’
rights, he also was consis-
"tently friendly and cheerful.
N The accident occurred in
the 211 raise at the mine,
where repair work had been
discontinued to allow the
_stope on the right side of the
raise to be worked. Vanner
J. Hegbloom, deputy state
mine inspector, who investi-
gated the accident, recom-
mended the installation of a
-hingted grating at stope level
’i'inthis type of raise, over the
“timber? slide. ‘ .

 

 Beacliel was 35 years old.
‘I13.--=leaves,, his wife and ‘four-

 

and James Rush, president of
Local 552 in Stamford, Conn.,
also called for passage of the
statement, which was reported
-out by the resolutions commit-
tee, chaired-by Board Member
Maclovio Barraza. —

_-The civil rights committee,
chaired by Board Member. Al

Petit-Clair, reported a resolu-

tion that was unanimously

adopted on Friday morning._

Organizations Commended

Saying that more meaningful.
civil rights legislation had been

passed in the 29 months since

the last Mine-Mill convention-
than at any time in the past~~

century, the resolution com-
mended the Congress of Racial
Equality, the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference, the
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored ‘Peo-
ple, the Negro American Labor
Council, the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee, the
Southern Conference Education-
al _Fund, the National. Urban
League, and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
“T h e demonstrations, t h e
marches, the pickets, the sit-ins,
the freedom rides-—all of the
many and varied civil rights
activities of the past many
years have have been crucial
in the battles to legislate and
to change attitudes. of our peo-
ple,” the resolution said. O
Reaffirming Mine-Mill’s his-

toric tradition of opposing dis-
crimination in all of its forms,
the statement instructs the ex-
ecutive board to review the un-
ion’s contribution to and partici-
pation in the civil rights move-
ment “so as to increase our as-
sistance and activity.”

Gap Widening
In view- of the fact that,

‘ despite the- recent legislative

gains, the social and economic

-gap between prospering main-

stream America and huge and
isolated pockets of minority
group members is not narrow-
ing, but is widening, the conven-
tion pledged to help : develop a
national, acceptance of action in
this area beyond the conven-
tional. “The ultimate answers,”
declared the resolution, “lie
well -beyond the rights-and-op-
portunities approach of the past
and presen ,’.’.adding that such
proposals as a government-
guaranteed annual income, a
massive public works program,
federal fair housing laws, and
programs to provide education,
employment, housing, and
health and welfare benefits de-
serve support.

The convention said that
Mine-Mill “gladly joins” in the
movement to create a “Grand

Alliance” of labor unions, re-'

ligious organizations, the aca-
demic community, and liberal
thinkers, as ‘proposed by the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King,

 

REV. FRED L. SHUTTLESWORTH. praising Mine-Mill for
its history of dedication to the civil rights struggle in this
country, calls for or Grand Alliance of labor groups, church
CInd-civic organizations, and all liberal thinkers in carrying

tion of the Southern Christian’

resolution“ too, urged Congres-
sional support for the move to
unseat - the five “Mississippi
regulars” now in the House of
Representatives, "and to seat in
their place the candidatesof the
Mississippi Freedom D e m o-
cratic Party. - ’

Both the resolution and the
Officers’ Report to the conven-
tion stressed the importance of
working to eliminate discrimi-
nation on the job, bothin terms
of hiring and promoting minori-
ty group members.

community levels, the Officers’
Report points out, too, that

not interested in the past. They

will measure everyone on‘ what .

is being done now, not yester-
day.” “There is much that still
remains to be done,” it con-
tinues, “and until it is, we can
never be satisfied.” .

The major point of’ several of
the many delegates who rose to
support the civil rights resolu-
tion on the floor of the conven-
tion was echoed by Internation-
al President Al Skinner, who
maintained, “The key thing is
not what we say to each other
here, but is what we do in this
area.” -

All Have   Stake in

Shuttlesworth, Urging 

Civil Rights, Says

 

rand Alliance’

All Americans’ must understand that they have a stake in the civil rights movement’s struggle in the United
States, Rev. Fred L. Shuttlesworth said in a speech to the Mine-Mill convention on Aug. 19, for they all need the
same th1ngs—good housing, jobs, education, and human dignity.

One of the founders and still the secretary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, he said that the

organization had changed markedly from its early days in 1957 “

on the busses.” Today, he told
the delegates, the other needs
as well are the organization's
concerns.

Brotherhood must be this
country's aim, he said, and in
this struggle “our motto is ‘For-
ward ever, backward never.’ ”

Commenting on his address,
Mine-Mill President Al Skinner
said, “You give us greater de-
termination and the courage to
do an even better: job" in bat-
tling discrimination.

Role of Individual

Speaking on only six hours of
sleep in the“ previous three and
a half days, Rev. Shuttlesworth
stressed the role of the indi-
vidual in the creation of a" better
society, saying that each Amer-
ican must know himself and de-
cide whether he is to work to
effectuate change or to main-
tain the status quo. Wehave an
obligation, he said, too, to speak
the truth one to another.

A . In- his fiery address, Rev.

Shuttlesworth called -for support
for The Grand Alliance—-a coali-
tion of labor, church, and civic
groups proposed at SCLC’s con-

vention a few weeks earlier—.

and said that “the top and bot-
tom of our society must come

' and walk together to make the

middle what it ought to. be."

begets violence, and violence is
wrong whether committed by
the Ku Klux Klan or the Negro.”

Move . . . and Fast-
Saying that the control by re-
actionary forces of the past
many years in this country has
been-broken, Rev. Shuttlesworth
said, “It’s time to move for-

ward and move so fast that we

can never turn back." He said
that great progress had been
made in changing the attitude of
the government and. the people
on discrimination, but that
forces still exist which say “No
further!”

Introduced by the Rev. M. C.
Williams, pastor of the New
Hope Baptist Church in Denver,‘
Rev. Shuttlesworth called Mine-
Mill one of the greatest labor
organizations in the country-—a

union “representing the best. in_

the hopes and aspirations of
mankind.” The leader of the
fight in Birmingham in Decem-
ber, 1954 against the city ordi-
nance requiring the separate
seating of whites and Negroes
on the city’s busses—one of the
early demonstrations providing

the sparks for the civil rights

revolution of the past decade-

was being made not only through
civil rights legislation, but
through programs such as the
War on Poverty. He stressed,
however, the importance of see-
ing that “the new funds don't go
down the old ratholes.”
-Declaring the importance of
God in the struggle for justice
and equality, Rev. Shuttlesworth
said that had he not known Bull
Connor so well, he would not
have known so well another man

.-_—-Jesus Christ. He was critical,

on the other hand, of the church

.in the U. ,S.,. saying, “When it

practices what it preaches, we'll
be done » with discrimination."

Rev. Shuttlesworth told the
delegates of a man who, when
asked by his son, “What makes
a lightning bug light?” could
answer only, “The stuff is just
in him." “The stuff,” he said
of the civil rights movement, “is
here to light up the world.’'

“I believe we shall overcome
in this country,” he concluded,
“not only discrimination and
segregation, but -cybernation,
automation, and hibernation.”

Movement for Human Rights, in

Time Is Now to Build “Quality
America,” Says NFU President 1

Saying that the time has come when we have the resources to build “a quality
America,” James G. Patton, president of the National Farmers Union, stated in a
speech to’ the Mine-Mill convention on Aug. 18 that the emphasis has to be “on the
quality of people.” Pointing out that a smaller percentage of the nation’s income was
today being spent on social programs than was the case 10 years ago, he said that the

‘ such.ntta‘cl_;sﬁon labor leaders in

 

overriding issue in the country now is to determine what kind of America we want and

to go after it.

He said he wanted the kind of country where there is a guaranteed annual mini-
mum wage of $5,000, where every citizen can get as much educaton as he can absorb,
where the family farm is preserved, where a drastic rebuilding job is done on the old

decaying cities.

“We now have the capital, the technical know-how, the human and natural re-
sources to permit all Americans to live in comfort and with dignity,” he said, charging

that the real necessity is “to
change our perspective.”

Patton said that this was not
the first time, nor would it be
the last that “I speak for and
of a qualitative America.” He
maintained, however, that a
higher level of government
spending is necessary to bring
about such a society.

city workers have not always
been allies, declared Patton,
sayin.g that their differences
have been due to misinforma-

tion on both sides. The chair-.

man of the National Council for
Industrial Peace-—a group found-
ed by Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
and Herbert Lehman to seek
the repeal of Section 14(b) of
Taft-Hartley-— Patton said that
the economic futures of the two
groups are closely linked. Both,
he said, must be part of a great
marshalling of forces neces-
sary to wipe out poverty in the
United States.

Family farmers in states with
“right-to-work” laws have suf-
fered from the low-wage econo-
mies such laws have perpetuat-
ed, he told the delegates. “We
know from experience,” he
said, “that the family farmer
has fared far better in the
states ‘where the industrial
workers have been able to bar-
gain collectively with manage-
ment for better wages.”

World Affairs

Turning to foreign affairs, he
declared that tomorrow’s world
must be one of law and order,
policed by a United Nations’
peace-keeping force, in which
there is demilitarization of the
various nation states. The Unit-
ed States, declared the Farmers
Union president, must under-
stand that it is not omnipotent
and that not all under-developed
countries will choose our eco-
nomic and political systems.

An adviser to the United Na-
tions’ Annual International Con-
ference on Food and Agricul-
ture since 1945, he said, “The
magnanimous challenge which
faces us as the leader of the
world is to abolish hunger and
poverty, to help the underde-
veloped through economic as-
sistance.”

“The only good thing about
Viet Nam,” stated Patton, “is
that we’ve broken through the
$100 billion ceiling on our na-
tional budget.” He said that that
amount should be going to the
fight against poverty alone.

Describing the “terrific strug-
gle” now going on concerning
the War on Poverty, in which
the “governors and politicians
are attempting to maintain con-
trol,” Patton called for a great-
er involvement in the program
by the poor.

“I believe in people,” he de-
clared, “. . . they’ll create the
necessary‘ capital, if given a
chance.” The kind of country
he does not want, said Patton, is
“an America controlled by a
few corporate giants, computer-
ized and impersonal.” '

Farm Bill Push

Given a standing ovation by
the delegates and guests, Patton
left immediately for Washington
to be on hand for the final
stages of the House fight on the
omnibus farm bill, H.R. 9811,
which was narrowly passed
there a few days later.

The Mine-Mill convention
unanimously endorsed the bill in
a resolution which also called
for increased concentration on
help for the family and low-

income farms. The resolution
urged “a generous sharing of
our food and fibre abundance
with the needy, both at home

-and abroad,” and said, too, that

“the plight of those Americans
who work for wages in agricul-
ture is a national disgrace}?
Mine-Mill Preisident Al Skin-
ner pledged an immediate all-
out drive by the union to help
secure passage of the farm bill.
By the following day, delegates
to the convention had wired
their Congressmen on that is-
sue, as well as on mine safety
and repeal of Section 14(b).

(Dem.-Montana)

Record of 89th Congress Must Include
-.14(b) Repeal, Mine Safety—Lee Metcalf

_ Bret Englund, pinch-hitting for U. S. Senator Lee Metcalf (D-Mont.), who was unable to leave Washington be-
_ cause of a move by special interest groups to pass legislation reducing substantially the regulation of electric utili-
- ties’ rates, called the record of the 89th Congress “unequaled in modern times, with the possible exception of the
 first;10O days of Franklin Roosevelt's administration,” in a speech at Tuesday’s session of the Mine-Mill convention.
‘ Delivering an address prepared by the Montana Senator, Englund, his chief administrative aide, emphasized this
aid to education, and many other pieces of legislation to

covering metal and mineral

— mines and mills would pass the

House before adjournment, per-
haps by the end of the month.

;While Senate action is not ex-

pected in 1965, Englund said that
“early next year we anticipate
hearings and action in the Sen-
ate to finally drag the mining
business into the 20th century.”
He quoted Congressman James
Scheuer, a first term Democrat
from New York City who at-
tended this year’s hearings on
mine safety conditions, as say-
ing, “I am shocked that in these
United States, in the ’60’s, we
have a small‘ percentage of our
working miners who are exposed
to the classic conditions of a
clearly predictable menace to
life and limb and health that we
read about as the appalling con-
ditions of the first decades of
the Industrial Revolution in Eng-
land perhaps 100 years ago.”
Congressman James O’Hara
of Michigan, who was chairing
the Labor subcommittee hear-
ings, said Englund, retorted,

“I’m glad I shocked somebody.”_

Headed Subcommittee

Sen. Metcalf, who in 1956
headed a special Congressional
subcommittee on mine safety,
which held hearings throughout

the country, said that Mine-»

Mill’s presentation on the sub-
ject at that time was the best
he'd ever heard, according to
Englund.
year’s push for the bill has been
“a real team effort,” noting the
broad labor support given to the
measure. He said he had worked
closely on the bill with‘ Leo Ter-
rill, Mine-Mill’s representative
in Washington, who “although-
comparatively new to the legis-
lative jungle . . . is establishing
a reputation for effective ac-
tion.”

Englund traced the history of
Congressional action in the area

He said that this-

of education from the Morrill
Act of over a century ago, and
stated that the 89th Congress
“has moved past that customary
tradition, of lending federal as-
sistance only in specialized
areas . . .-and had asserted the
principle of federal support of
all branches of education to be
administered and supervised un-
der the control of local school
boards?’

Pointing to legislation that is
still to be enacted, he included
the Teaching Professions Act, to
create a national teachers corps
for assignments ‘ in low-income
districts, and the Higher Educa-
tion Act, which would provide
opportunities to thousands of
youngsters now denied the
chance for higher education.

Up for Re-election

Englund was escorted to the
podium by members of the
union’s Montana Legislative
Council, a group expected to be
extremely active in Sen. Met-
calf’s campaign for re-election

Early Retirement in Auto

With the big increase in pension benefits for retirement at age
60, applications for retirement in the auto industry are running
three to five times above normal. As an example, at Ford there
are normally some 200 applications for retirement in process at
one time. In mid-August, there were 914 on hand. '

The industry anticipates some shortage of skilled workers as
a result of the sharp upswing in retirements.

Goodrich Workers Give Up 36-Hourweek

United Rubber Workers at Goodrich in Akron Voted to change
their work schedule from six six-hour days per week to five eight-

the World War II years, since 1931. The switch will cause displace-
ment of some 100 of the 3,400 employees at the plant. Under a
supplemental unemployment benefit plan, the 100 will draw almost
full pay. The company estimates that by the end of the year surplus
employment will be eliminated by quits, retirement or death.

a similar workweek switch.

These convention recommendations, along with a few
other proposed constitutional changes, will be voted upon

it by the union’s entire membership in the October referen-

dum, which will also settle two races for executive board

positions in Districts 1 and 3.

If approved, 25 cents of the per capita hike would
be applied to the international strike fund, beginning on

Jan. 1, 1967, contributing signifi-
cantly to the building of a $1
million fund, as projected at the
district conferences held earlier
in the year.

Over 40 delegates —- from the

M—M History
Now Available

“The Years From Virginia
City, Nevada,” a new 28-
page pamphlet which brieﬂy
traces the history of Mine-
Mill over the past century,
was distributed, hot off the
press, to delegates to the
union’s convention in Denver
last month.

Copies are now being
mailed to all local union of-
ficers and stewards.

Additional copies for local
unions may be orde-red from
the international office. They
are available at five cents
apiece.

Prepared as the result of
many requests from the
union’s members and staff,
the pamphlet indicates the
important role played by
Mine-Mill in the history of
our country and of the early
West. A detailed history of
the union in the United States
and Canada would fill several
volumes, and, as President
Al Skinne-r pointed out at the
convention, “someday, some-
how that history must be
written.”

In the meantime, the new
pamphlet graphically de-
scribes at least a small part
of the union’s rich history-—
a history of which its mem-
bers can justifiably be proud.
A concept of history, too,
can well serve all of us in
better understanding the pres-
ent and confidently approach-
ing the opportunities of the
future. .

SEVRGEANTS-AT-ARMS AT THE CONVENTION were, from

also had previously been thor-
oughly aired in the 35-man con-
stitution committee, chaired by
District 1 Board Member Barney
Rask. While some felt the mem-
bership of their locals might not
fully support the increases, al-
most all themselves backed the
measures.

Expanded Operations

In addition to the importance
of strengthening the strike fund,
many delegates pointed to the
necessity of increasing income
in order to provide for the
planned expansion of union oper-
ations, to increase the wages
and benefits of the Mine-Mill
officers and employees, and to
better. the servicing of local
unions by the international. “We
have passed all kinds of resolu-
tions at this convention,” said
Theodore Speight of Local 552 in
Stamford, Conn., “and all of
them take. money to put into
effect.”

Reginald Beavis, president of
Local 1 in Butte, Mont., called
the financial proposal “the most
realistic ever presented.” He
said that the executive board
was to be commended for com-
ing up with the plan.

Several delegates pointed out
that the program was, far from
one designed out of financial
desperation, well suited to med?
the needs of the union and its
membership for several years
to come. “This resolution,” said
Tom Jones of Local 233 in Me-
Gill, Nev., “is comparable to a
gold mine . . . you can’t just sit
on it if you want it to produce.”
He said that his local had sub-
mitted a resolution calling for
an immediate increase of $1 in
per capita, rather than having
that hike spread over four
years. ‘

Many locals submitted resolu-
tions on finances, most of them
calling for an increase in some
form and directed to the build-
ing of a substantial strike fund.

which considered all such reso-
lutions, reported out what was

substantially the proposal of the
executive board.

25: Hike Per Year

The proposal calls for a per
capita increase of 25 cents on
Jan. 1 of 1966, ’67, '68, and ’69.
The first year’s increase would
go into the union’s general fund,
with most of it slated to provide
increased wages, pensions, and
other benefits for union em-
ployees. On Jan. 1, 1967, the
25-cent hike would be applied to
the strike ftmd, making a total
of 50 cents per member per
month going to that fund from
that point on. Twenty-five-cent
increases in 1968 and 1969 would
go to the general fund to handle
the increased operating costs
resulting from the expansion of
the union’s activities and for
further anticipated employee
wage and benefit costs.

The strike fund, which stood
at $79,511 as of June 30, 1965,
after having disbursed $95,210 in
strike relief last year, would be
up to approximately $260,000 by
July 1, 1967 if the per capita
increase is approved and provid-
ing there are no substantial
drains on the fund in the mean-
time. " '

Company Told

lo Re-hire 45
Mt. Isa Strikers

BRISBANE, Australia—-Mt. Isa
Mines, 53 percent owned by the
American Smelting and Refin-
ing Company, has announced
that it will appeal an early Au-
gust order by Industrial Com-
missioner-Taylor that the com-
pany re-employ 45 workers it
had rejected in April, when re-
hiring hundreds of other former
employees at the end of a
lengthy and bitterlabor dispute.

The men are to be re-em-
ployed within 14 days ofthe de-
termination of the company’s
appeal, if it is turned down.

“I have come to the conclu-
sion,” said Taylor, in ordering

the company to re-employ the I

men, “that these former em-
ployees of the company have
been refused reinstatement
either at the instigation of offi-
cials of the Australian Workers’
Union or for some other reason
which the company has seen fit
not to disclose.” In his opinion,
he said, the former is the real
reason.

During the strike, which be-
gan late last year and continued
for several months in 1965, sev-
eral local leaders gained sub-
stantial support in urging a
breakaway from the AWU. The
strike, in fact, continued for sev-
eral weeks after the Queensland
Industrial Commission reversed
an earlier ruling and ordered a
pay increase amounting to $6.75
per week, primarily on the
grounds that certain local lead-
ers would be excluded from such
a settlement. ‘

When, on Feb. 17, the com-
pany offered work to all men
who had been on its payroll on
Dec. 14, AWU officials told the
Mt. Isa employees to go back to
work, but too few responded to
operate the mine.

Although the 45 men are still
members of the Australian Work-
ers’ Union, it was the Queens-
land Trades and Labor Council,
not the AWU, which took their

. case to -the industrial commis-

sion.
Taylor also noted that “None

of the applicants, so far as the .

evidence disclosed, have been
charged with any breach ..of
union rules. and so have not-
been accorded the elementary
right of being heard -in their own

goal, the executive board pro-
poses to levy a $5 strike fund
assessment in 1966 and again in
1967——actions that do not require
approval on a referendum.
Again providing there are no
lengthy strikes in the meanwhile,
the $1 million figure should be
reached by 1970.
Board Responsibility

International P r e s id e nt Al
Skinner, who admitted that it
would have been very comfort-
able to come before the conven-
tion and report the excellent
record and genuine accomplish-
ments in the financial operations
of the union, said that the execu-
tive board, after long considera-
tion, came to the conclusion that
“we have a responsibility as

Financial Report

The financial report, present-
ed to the convention by Dichter,
showed that the international
union emerged from a deficit
operation in early 1963 to a sur-
plus operation by the end of that
year. A budgetary system,
adopted by the executive board
in July, 1963, took effect that
August. The favorable trend has
continued throughout 1964 and
so far this year, with income
over expenditures a v er a gin g
close to $6,000 per month.

The balance in the general
fund,_ which stood at $20,000 in
July, 1963, was up to $152,700 by
June 30, 1965.

P|'l|lClDl€ Of 39” Arbitration Rulingin Morenci, Arizona
Attacks Discrimination Against Union

MORENCI, Ariz.——In an arbitration award giving laborer’s jobs and back pay to last Oct. 2 to seven members

Defense Won In
El Paso Award

EL PASO, Texas — Armando

A Delgado, a member of Mine-

Mill Local 501, was reinstated
on Aug. 16 to his job at the
Phelps Dodge refinery here, as

' the result of an Aug. 4 arbitra-

tion award by John E. Gorsuch
of Denver.

, Fired along with another em-

ployee on May 21 for fighting

and/or horseplay, Delgado had

/‘worked for PD for 10 years
without, union testimony showed,-

ever having previously been dis-
ciplined or suspended. Following
a hearing on July 20, the arbi-
trator decided that the com-
pany had failed to substantiate
its disciplinary measures and
that Delgado had acted in self
defense.

_ In ‘his award, therefore, Gor-
such attacked a company prac-
tice, unknown to the union until
this grievance, of firing both
Amen whenever a fight occurred.
W. B. Langley, longtime person-
nel director for Phelps Dodge,
said on cross-examination that
it made no difference to the
company whether or not one
man was the aggressor or
whether one of the participants
struck back or not. He said,
further, that the question of
provocation was not taken into
consideration, as both men were
discharged whenever a fight
took place.

Unknown to Union

' “There was no evidence the
union ever knew of or consented
to such a practice,” stated Gor-
such-in his opinion, adding that
“the company could not refuse
to recognize so well established
a principle as the right of self

 defense.” He noted that “the

‘vast majority of the other arbi-
trators in this country today”

. agree with that principle.

Handwriting Analysis

The August issue of The In-
ternational Teamster magazine
issues a call to all members
who have been subjected to
handwriting analysis, described
as “the newest gimmick in per-
sonnel relations,” to report
such examinations to President
James Hoffa at the union’s in-

ternational headquarters in
«Washington, D. C. '

 , The practice involves the sub-'

  

‘ ission of the handwriting of
“ fie job applicant or employee

:1-for study by a" so-called “graph-

ologist,” who is supposed to be
able to determine the person-
ality traits of the writer.

f‘This method of invasion of
personal privacy,” the magazine
point out, “. . . follows on the
heels of the general discredita-
tion of the so-called lie-detector
as a personnel tool by recent
Congressional hearings.”

V- Peter Ferrara, presi-
dent of the International Grapho-
analysis Society, s ays that
handwriting analysis is used
extensively in business, al-
though he reports, “most busi-
nesses are reluctant to let their
‘competitors know they use it.
Its use is not yet completely ac-
cepted." ’

use handwriting analysis in an

prono individuals. Many “help

Corporation against Mine-Mill members.
The cash award in the case, considering the work week that has prevailed at the property, will amount to
approximately $6,500 for each worker——a total of $45,486——less other earnings during the period, which were very

small in all cases.

, of Local 616 here, Dr. George H. Hildebrand attacked a longstanding policy of discrimination by the Phelps Dodge

The union’s position in the arbitration, presented in hearings on Jan. 29 and March 12-13 by International
Representative Sylvain Schnaittacher, was that there was a pattern of discrimination against Mine-Mill members

in the company’s hiring practices. The seven men, who

re-employment although Phelps
Dodge, beginning last October,
had begun ﬁlling vacancies by
transfer from other divisions, by
re-employment of persons laid
off from other divisions, and by
hiring new men.

In replying to the company’s
argument that the seven em-
ployees-—Tim Madrid, E. B.
Morales, J. C. Garcia, E. B.
Stearns, E. B. Alvillar, A. Bittle
and Albert Molinar—were not
re-employed because of their
ages and on the basis of “con-

fidential” foremen’s reports, Dr. I

Hildebrand said that PD had not
supported its rejection of the
men with “tangible evidence."

Long Struggle

The arbitration victory cli-
maxes a long struggle by Local
616 against a situation of there
being no seniority connection be-
tween the Various divisions of
PD’s Morenci branch-—smelter,
open pit, mill. In other words,
it had been possible for persons
with considerable seniority to be
laid off from one division, and

\had been laid off in April, 1963, had been by-passed for

if not recalled, to be without a
job even though the company
might "be hiring in another divi-
sion.

Seeking to correct this situa-
tion, the union, in 1959 negotia-
tions, had secured language
which gave Mine-_Mill-represent
ed workers on layoff status pri-
ority in hiring into other divi-
sions. But language requiring
these laid-off employees to
“meet the employment stand-
ards of the company equally
well in all respects as another
applicant for employment” had
allowed the company to disre-
gard the contract clause on
seniority by misusing the “em-
ployment standards” clause.

Whether or not workers met

standards “equally well” was
not subject to arbitration.

In 1962, the union unsuccess-
fully attempted to arbitrate the
standards themselves, maintain-
ing that they had been set up
artificially and were being ad-
ministered unfairly in order to
discriminate against Mine-Mill

members. For example, the
company’s age limit of 45 for
re-employment and other re-
quirements were overlooked for
certain favored persons, who
were passed from one division
to another by transfer.

Union Membership Clause

While the union had been able
to arbitrate discrimination in
this area because of creed, race,
color, or national origin, it was
only last year that the right was
won to arbitrate discrimination
“because of membership in the
union.” It was on the basis of
this clause that the arbitration

‘ award, handed down on July 22,

was made.

Laid off in April, 1963, the
Mine-Mill members had restora-
tion rights in the open pit and
surface divisions. When Phelps
Dodge on Oct. 2, 1964_ began,
after a long lapse, again to hire
men for the smelter, ore dress-
ing, and maintenance divisions,
the seven men were rejected,
despite the fact that there were

cued three pigs, three lambs,

~mittee in charge of the picnic.

no persons on layoff status from
those divisions at that time.

Three. were eliminated, said-

the company at the hearing, be-
cause of “confidential reports”
that it refused to disclose. Four
others were rejected because of
their age. On Oct. 17, Local 616
filed the initial grievance in this
case.
Not Consistent

In arguing the case, the union
pointed out at the hearings that
PD did not consistently apply
its restriction that a candidate
for a laborer’s job be under 45
years of age nor its criteria for
physical fitness. Further, it
claimed that a foreman’s report
form requires a rating on the
employee’s “attitude toward the
company,” and that such a re-
quirement is improper and dis-
criminatory. Schnaittacher main-
tained, too, that, while the com-
pany had made direct transfers
of men from other bargaining
units outside the hiring division,
on Mine-Mill candidates from
outside the division, PD’s prac-
tice had been to lay them off
first and then subject them to
the strict application of the em-
ployability criteria.

Local 616 Business Agent
Frank Z. Morales compiled the
data which showed that of 71
openings that were filled be-
tween April 4, 1963 and March,
1965 only 18 involved placement
from Mine-Mill sources, and that
of those 18, five were not union
members. Of 38 laborers’ jobs
filled from Oct. 2, 1964, none
were from Mine-Mill units.

Active Union Men

Finally, it was ‘pointed out that
Molinar, Morales, and Madrid
were very active union men.
Madrid, in fact, had helped or-
ganize the local originally, had
served four years as a trustee,
another four as secretary, and
had been a grievanceman from
1947 until his layoff. Stearns,
who earlier had received an
over-age transfer, was laid off
after he had filed a grievance
and was later‘ refused re-employ-
ment because of his age.

Dr. Hildebrand, in his award,
noted that other employees had
been allowed to transfer al-
though being over-age, as well
as one who had an impaired
elbow. He pointed, too, to the
ratio of advantage of 3 to 1 for
non-Mine-Mill sources in filling
the 71 vacancies over a two-year
period, - although Mine-Mill is
the largest union at the property.

The company, he concluded,
failedto supply grounds for its
refusal to re-employ the seven
grievants.

Not only are the men back at
work, but they are now secure
in their employment. Under a
change in the seniority provi-
sions on layoff negotiated last
year, layoffs from each division
will be in reverse order of
branch-wide seniority dates
rather than on the basis of divi-
sional employment dates. This
is of particular importance to
the older employees at this
property, such as Stearns, who
is 59, and Alvillar, 55. Madrid
and Bittle, who were refused re-

‘employment, according to the

company, because of their age,
are just over 45.

Local President Carl A. Krass
and Tony Munoz, grievance com-
mittee chairman, have stressed

‘the fight on hiring practices for

many years. It is expected that
the recent arbitration ‘victory
should result in fairer handling
of employment practices by
Phelps Dodge in the future. 7

THE MINE-MILL UNION

September. 

 

  

   

when most of the major contracts in -the non-ferrous

-metals industry will again be open, delegates to the 59th
_MinegMill convention passed a lengthy bargaining resolu-
’ tion which, while not spelling out all of the specific de-

mands that the union will make in the next round of
negotiations, did set forth in general terms_ collective
bargaining objectives for the years ahead.

First on the list is the desire for a complete over-
haul of the union’s pension plans, which, the resolution
‘stated, “have become completely outmoded in the past
’18 months as pension negotiations in the auto,_ rubber,

trucking, and other industries have substantially raised
basic benefit levels, provided for early retirement and
survivors’ benefits, and introduced other improvements.”
With most of the chains due to negotiate pensions in

1967, along with all other con-

tract b e n e f i t s, the Mine-Mill

AS&R Council is scheduled to go

into bargaining on pensions one
year earlier—-in 1966. ‘

Other Objectives

Delegates, too, said that the
union must continue to place ma-
jor emphasis on appropriate and
substantial wage increases. Oth-
er general demands put forth in

_ the resolution were in the areas
of job security, which continues
to be threatened by the erosion

_of jobs due to automation and
technological change, union se-
curity, and health and welfare.
Also proposed were several con-
tract c h a n g e s which would

. strengthen the grievance and ar-

_ bitration procedures, the position

7 of the union’s safety committees,
 and would prevent work belong- '
. ~'—ing to Mine-Mill bargaining units
’ ' ‘from being, performed byafore.-if
" " rne"ni"or_others~ outside. those bar- 1

-saining_’.un.its'-:52  _ T _

   
   

With production per man-hour
continually increasing, the reso-
lution pointed out, there is a
growing disparity between com-
pany profits and wage costs. Net
profits after taxes of the major
non-ferrous producers u n d e r
Mine-Mill contracts increased in
1964 by more than 331/a percent
as compared with the previous
year. Profits this year are now
running at more than double the
rate achieved in 1963.

Reported to the convention out
of the 22-man contract bargain-
ing committee, chaired by Dis-
trict 3 Board Member Verne
Curtis, the resolution noted that
this year’s passage of the medi-

care bill would importantly af-

fect the union’s health and wel-
fare objectives ‘for retired mem-

bers over 65 and; for early and
‘disability retirees.’ other legis-
lation, -now pending. before Con-V

Convention Looks to 1967, Nego

General Objectives Set; %
Pension Gains Important

Anticipating ‘a favorable bargaining climatein 1967,

to change federal standards af-
fecting. the length _of the work
week, overtime pay, the .. mini-
mum wage and its coverage also
will have an effect on the shap-
ing of specific union demands.

Achievoble Goals ‘
Many of the generalized bar-

.gaining objectives mentioned in t '

the resolution hadabeen outlined
by the Mine-Mill executive board
in the Officers’ Report to the
convention, which stated, “We
have no illusions that a program
based on these principles can be
won without struggle, nor that
it will not involve substantial
extra cost to the companies; We
can achieve these goals, how-
ever,” the report said, “if we
are determined to break through
again in 1967 as we did in 1964.”

The c 0 nv e n t i on resolution
called last year’s three-year set-
tlements “the most substantial
ever negotiated by Mine-Mill,”
and outlined the tremendous
wage and benefit gains since the
end of World War II, after the
lifting of wartime controls. Aver-
age hourly earnings have tripled
in the industry in the past 20
years, and great improvements
have been made in shift differ-
entials, vacation programs, and,

‘primarily due to last year’s
breakthrough, in the area of job ,
-security.

Pension Improvements
Noting that pension improve-
ments are expensive contract

items and that the coming strug-
gle requires the full support ‘of’

every Mine-Mill local" union,-the

delegates outlined 10 specific. ob-  V

jectives tobe incuded in an over,--,

as- follows:

As we meet in convention, our-country is|i_nvo1ved_ in a

war in Viet Nam. which threatens the peace of the world. ._
This war seems to grow more intense day by day. More

American troops are involved, more American arms. V ‘

All of us known how thin is the line whicheseparates the ~
war in Viet Nam from another World War; A World War-_

today means the destruction of all humanity.

, The members of our union. without hesitation supported .,

President ‘Johnson and Vice-President Humphrey in the elec-
tion. We have given equal support to the President’s domestic
program-_-including civil rights, medicare, the anti-poverty
program,'re'peal of 14(b). We believe the President’s domestic

program is dedicated to making our country a better place i

to live in. But we have questions about our Viet Nampolicy.

If our purpose is to achieve an independent Viet*Nam‘,'
then we must give the Vietnamese the opportunity of being" ’

independent. Within the context of what is happening in Viet

. Nam today, this can only be achieved through a return to‘ ~

the principles of the 1954 Geneva Agreement. ;
We are pleased that President Johnson 'a few weeks ago

stated that the Geneva Agreement can be a basis for peace

negotiations. The Geneva Agreement calls for free elections

in all Viet -Nam and the ultimate removal of all foreign‘ V

troops from Viet Nam soil.

Peace negotiations are not easy to begin. But‘ begin

and short work weeks, "the con» ~

 

curity gains of last year must be
consolidated and extended.
Emphasis should be given, the
delegates said, to winning in-
creased beneﬁt credits per year

' of service under the present se-

curity-severance plans, extension
of the plans to an industry-wide
basis, and supplemental unem-
ployment benefits of "guaranteed
duration‘ for junior employees
and unlimited duration for senior
employees. The <Kennecott em-
ployment security plan, under
which no worker cantbe laid
because of automation or tech-
nological change, should be ex-
tended to an industry-wide basis,
the delegates maintained.
Prediction that U.S. lead mine
production will have more than
doubled by 1968 over 1958, with
employment in the mining of
lead in -1968 estimated at little

more than half the number of

1958 workers, was presented as
but one example of the need to
strengthen job security meas-
ures in union contracts.

Health and Welfare

Mine-Mill, the delegates said,
should continue to push for in-
dustry-wide uniformity of health
and welfare benefits, by making
all plans fully comprehensive in
coverage and by eliminating em-
ployee contributions. Joint un-
ion-company administration, im-
provement in life insurance cov-
erage, in weekly sickness and ac-
cident benefits, and in surgical,
medical, and hospital fee bene-
fits were established as other
health and welfare goals.

In the area of union security,
the resolution stated that repeal
of Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hart
ley Act will not automatically
establish union shops in present
“right-to-work” states, but that

union shop clauses must be ne-

gotiated by the union and man-

-agement, It if c t e s that such
;.. clauses provide: .addi_tion_al;;bar-
.'5vgaihingamuscleg‘whieli<can:be,ne-

 

gotiated in such states immedi-
ately after repeal, and are an
important factor in the financial
strength and security of the un-
ion.

In another resolution adopted
by the convention, the delegates
instructed the executive board to
make a thorough study of the

inroads of automation on em-

r ployment in the non-ferrous

"metals industry and to develop
a program, best suited for the

particular industry, desigiied to
elminate layoffs.

Additional resolutions called
for Mine-Mill to take the lead in
struggling for the 30-hour work

week without reduction in pay, 
.. to demand higher penalty rates

for overtime work, exposing the

. fallacy that overtime raises the-

worker’s standard of living, to

further pursue the policy of

achieving common contract ex-
piration dates, and to withhold
the signing of any national
agreement until all locals within
a council have reached agree-
ment on local issues.

L. L. Nielsen of Local 392 in

Magna, Utah served as secre-

tary of the bargaining commit-
tee.

   Support Mounts for “Conspiracy”   Case Defense;

The unanimous vote by delegates to Mine-Mill’s 59th
convention to support the legal fight against the con-
spiracy convictions of six past and present officers of the
union was followed, on Aug. 26, by the filing of a petition
with the U. S. Supreme Court by defense attorneys ask-
ing for a review of the case.

The appeal, which maintains that the indictment was
legally defective to begin with, questions the constitution-
ality of the section of the Taft-Hartley Act on which the
case is based, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,
and presents five other reasons for believing that the
defendants have been denied a fair trial.

In a lengthy resolution thanking the many organiza-
tions which have supported the “conspiracy” case defense,
convention delegates said that the final vindication of the

defendants “will be in no small part due to their efforts”.

The American Civil Liberties
Union, which will also file a
brief asking the Supreme Court
to review the case, will be
joined by the Amalgamated
Meat Cutters and Butcher Work-
men of North America, the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers
of America, and the National
Farmers Union, the resolution
pointed out.

The International Typographi-
cal Union, holding its 107th con-
vention in Washington, D.C. dur-
ing the same week as the Mine-
Mill parley, voted to add its
name to the petition to the high
court, and other international
unions also are expected to
join in signing the ACLU brief.

tion pledged the “necessary

Application Filed

Having successfully organized
two plants in Milwaukee, Wisc.
during the past several months,
Mine-Mill now is attempting to
unionize a third-—the Standard
Brass Works, a small plant em-
ploying some 16 workers. An
NLRB election at the property
has been set for Sept. 8.

The other two plants there are
Allied Smelting, where agree-
ment was recently reached ‘on a
new contract which will provide
60 cents per hour over a three-
year period, and the Mid-City
Foundry, where certification as
bargaining a gent was just
granted when the Regional La-
bor Relations Board dismissed
company charges that the June
17 election had been improperly
conducted.

Twin Buttes

In addition, the union has peti-
tioned for an NLRB election at
Anaconda’s new Twin Buttes
property about 34 miles south
of Tucson, Ariz. No date has yet
been set.

Some 200 workers are now en-
gaged in stripping operations at
the property, which is expected
to become a 60,000 to 80,000
ton per year open pit copper
mine.

The $60 million development
is the company's first in Ari-
zona, and is expected to even-
tually employ at least 1,000

' workers. Removal of some 165

Typographical llnion’s Statement
On Mine-Mill “Conspiracy” Case

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Delegates to the 107th convention of the
International Typographical Union on Aug. 19 adopted a resolution
authorizing the union’s executive council to join with the American
Civil Liberties Union and other labor unions in asking the U. S.
Supreme Court to review the Mine-Mill “conspiracy” case.

The ITU statement said:

“Whereas, organized labor from its earliest days to the present
time has been the victim of injunctive and conspiracy persecution,
and H '

“Whereas, six trade unionists, present or past leaders of the
Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union, have been convicted of
‘conspiracy to defraud the government’ by falsely signing non-
Communist affidavits under the Taft-Hartley law. Unless the
Supreme Court reverses this decision they face prison terms of 18
months to three years, and

“Whereas, the prosecution in this case has much to explain.
Three of the men indicted for conspiracy never signed the affi-

. davits; the trial began after the Taft-Hartley law was amended by

the Landrum-Griffin Act which abolished the requirement of non-
Communist oaths; and it was instituted in the midst of a strike of
the union against the Big Five copper companies more than three
years after the original indictment had been handed down. For
these and other reasons, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that
the Government was willing to do a little union-busting in the name
of anti-Communism under the forms of law, and

“Whereas, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote in
1949 that the conspiracy law is “elastic, sprawling and pervasive
. . . As a practical matter, the accused often is confronted with a
hodge-podge of acts and statements by others which he may never
have authorized or intended or even known about, but which helped
to persuade the jury of the existence of the conspiracy itself. In
other words, a conspiracy often is proved by evidence that is admis-
sible only upon the -assumption that the conspiracy existed.’

“Now, therefore be it resolved, that this 107th Convention of the
International .'l‘yp'ographical Union authorizes the Executive Council
to join with the American Civil Liberties Union, and other trade‘
unions which have agreed to do so, to file a brief amicus curiae

’ in s_uppprt._of a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the
United-_VStates,“seeking the reversal of these convictions.” » .-

lated and manufactured harass-
ment against our union.” It
pointed to the fact that the law
on which the convictions are
based was repealed in 1959, even
before the first trial took place,
and expressed “unqualified con-
fidence not only in the justice of
the case of our six brothers, but
in their qualities as American
citizens and as trade union
leaders.”

Changed Attitudes

David Jenkins, secretary of
the Mine-Mill Defense Commit-
tee, in his report to the conven-
tion noted “an enormous change"
that has taken place in Ameri-
can life over the past few years.
No longer, he said, are so many
people remaining silent in the
face of mccarthyism--a silence,
he added, which in the past has
borne “so much bitter‘ fruit."

“An overwhelming majority”
in the labor movement, said Jen-
kins, support the Mine-Mill de-
fense, and, additionally, are ap-

preciative of the fight that the -

union has fought for so many
years against such false charges.
The use of the pervasive
“conspiracy” doctrine ‘ in this
case is seen as a potential
threat to all labor organizations,

.many union leaders have said

repeatedly.

Among the many delegates
who rose to support the defense
resolution on the convention

sentative M. C. (Dick) Anderson,

being allowed to see their'fami-

allegedly “confessed.” Eightof
the strikers were convicted, but
those convictions were reversed
in 1943 by the U. S. Supreme
Court, which ruled that the
“confessions" had been obtained
by thirddegree methods. On a
new trial, all of the defendants
were acquitted. -

Labor Support

Other labor organizations list-
ed by the convention resolution
as having aided in ‘the pres-
ent “conspiracy” case defense
include the United Packing-
house Workers, the International
Longshoremen’s and Warehouse-
men’s Union, District 65_ of the
Retail, Wholesale and. Depart-
ment Store Union, A. Philip

munications Association, the

sters, the Carpenters Union
Council of Northern California,
the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic

Workers Union, the United Elec- .

trical, Radio, and Machine
Workers, the Fur and Leather
Workers Councils in New York
and Chicago.

Maintaining that the six de-
fendants were accused “only be-
cause of the steps taken . . . to
defend this union from attacks
by employers and by raiding
unions,” the resolution in-
structed the executive board to
take -the necessary measures to
carry on the work of the de-
fendants should they be impris-
oned, to continue to fight’ for
their release, and to take ‘ap-
propriate steps for the support
of their families. ' ‘

The brief by the American
Civil Liberties Union, signedby
the several national labor or-
ganizations, is exected "to ‘be
filed with the Supreme Court
during September. ,

Among the many issues raised
in the petition filed by attorneys
Taylor, Witt, and Francis are
the refusal by the trial judge
to allow the introduction of
union vouchers
have discredited the testimony
of a prosecution witness, the
admission of testimony by an-
other witness who had died in
the time between the two trials,
and the judge’s charge to the
jury on what could and what
could not be considered as rele-
vant evidence.

Local 537 Contract Has
131/2c to 2.11/2c in Wages  

BUFFALO, N. Y.—Members
of Mine-Mill Local 537, the
Queen City Smelter Workers,
ratified on Aug. 9 a new two-
year contract with the Samuel
Greenfield Smelting Company
which provides wage gains of
131/2 cents to 21% cents per hour
over that period, increased shift
differentials, and double time
and a half for holiday work. The
settlement, too, includes a re-
opener on pensions and sev-
erance pay after the first year.

Wage increases in the first
year are 61/: cents per hour
across-the-board, with an addi-
tional five cents for furnace
operators, h e lp ‘e r s, sweater
operators, and pot operators
and helpers. In the second year,
seven. cents across-the-board - is
gained, along with three cents
more for the above classifica-
tions.

2|‘/2' Cents for 40 Percent.
,-Employees working on all of

the fu rn la c e s, who comprise
about 40: percent of "the 52 Work-

ers in the unit, thus receive
21% cents per hour over the two
years.

A one cent an hour increase

in the shift differentials for .
each of the two night shifts was

won for each year of the new
contract. This will bring the to-
tal differentials to 14 cents and
15 cents for the second and third
shifts respectively.

Demand Increasing lor Mineral
tommodities, Says Memmott

Rapidly .progressing technology has expanded the po-

tential of the mineral-extractive industries, according to 9

Frank C. Memmott, acting director of the U.S. Bureau of
Mines, who was the featured speaker on the opening day
of the 59th Mine-Mill convention at the Albany Hotel in

Denver.

Predicting that the value of mineral commodities
produced in the United States this year would reach an
all-time high, he said that, along with demands for larger
quantities of metals and minerals, there are demands
also for a greater variety of mineral commodities. “Hope-
fully,” he continued, “as our extractive industries increase
in number, scope, and efficiency  . the opportunities for
employment will likewise be sustained.” -

The Bureau of Mines, he said, is conducting resource
investigations throughout the country and is attempting

to evaluate the potential for ad-
ditional mineral output. The
types of deposits being ex-
amined, Memmott stated, are
those suitable for producing

. chemicals, fertilizers, ceramics,

and various metal products, in-
cluding silver.

Named acting director of the
bureau in January, after serv-
ing as deputy director for a
year, Memmott has had a
varied 10-year career in mining.
He holds bachelor’s and mas-
ter’s degrees and has taken ad-
vanced courses in mining engi-
neering at Carbon College.

Goal ls Conservation

Outlining for the some 200
delegates some * of the many
functions of the Bureau of
Mines, he called for the coop-
eration of labor, management,
and government in continually
working to promote conserva-
tion. Both President Johnson
and Interior Secretary Stewart
Udall, he said, are deeply con-
cerned not only in the conserva-
tion of material resources, but
also in the_conservation of hu-
man resources and human
skills.

He said that the bureau’s cur-
rent research includes attempts
to develop improved methods
for mining phosphate in inclined
beds, to determine how steep
the slopes can be in open pit
copper operations without en-
dangering men and equipment,

. to learn better waysof control-

ling caving in underground
mines. The Coeur d’Alene dis-
trict in Idaho and‘ the San
Manuel mine in Arizona are two

of the sites where such research,

work is going on.

‘ , Oil Shale

Briefly tracing the history of
oil shale development in the

' Rocky Mountain area, Memmott
- spoke hopefully of the current

work now being carried on by
private industry and the Colo-
rado.School of Mines Research
Foundation. “Future develop-
ment of the vast oil shale re-
serves of the Rocky Mountains,
estimated to contain as much as
two trillion barrels of shale oil
or petroleum equivalent,” he

4 said, “would obviously open up

 

greater opportunities for employ-
ment of people and for profit-
able business enterprise.”

Emphasizing the importance
of conducting government activ-
ities in the most prudent and
economical manner, Memmott
stated that the bureau is en-
gaged in a determined cost-re-
duction program, which involves
the consolidation of facilities,
theinstitution of better operat-
ing procedures, and the elimina-
tion of any duplication in activ-
ities. He said that Denver is
expected to become the mining
research center for the Bureau
of Mines.

He pointed, too, to ‘the pio-
neering work of the bureau in
developing methods to bring
such new metals as titanium,
hafnium, and zirconium into

_ commercial production. Tita-

nium, Memmott noted, is now
used in the structural parts and
for the outer skins. of space
capsules.

District 3 Board Member
Verne Curtis of Magna, Utah,
the state fro-m which ‘Memmott
hails, introduced the acting di-
rector. Also in attendance for
his speech were E. W. Felegy,
district manager in Denver for
the Bureau of Mines, and A. C.
Moschetti and A. Z.. Dimitroff,
mining health and safety engi-
neers at the Denver office.

many guests from the Denver
community. A reception, buffet
dinner, and dance were held the
following evening in the Al-
bany’s ballroom, which was also

the site of the regular conven-‘

tion sessions.

Eight committees — on rules,
credentials, bargaining, press
and education,,civil rights, legis-
lative and political action, con-
stitution, and resolutions - met
on Monday and Tuesday eve-
nings and sporadically through-
out the week, sifting through
resolutions and other proposals
submitted by the various locals
and the union’s executive board.
A special session on ladies
auxiliaries was held Tuesday
evening.

Constitutional
Changes Proposed

Convention action on their re-
ports supported several recom-

-mended changes in the constitu-

tion—-proposals which would be
voted upon by the entire mem-
bership in the October ref-
erendum.

Approved by an ‘overwhelming.

vote was a resolution, reported
from the constitution committee,
which would set minimum local
uniontdues at $6 per month and
would increase the per capita
payment to the international
union by a total of $1 per
month per member over a
period of four years, through
25c increases on Jan. 1, 1966,
’67, ’68, and ’69.

The 35-man constitution com-
mittee, which was chaired by
Board Member Barney Rask
and on which almost every 10-

- cal in attendance was repre-

sented, , also recommended a
change ‘which would increase
the salaries of the international
officers and staff by anpaverage
of nine percent. Adopted un-
animously by the convention, the

resolution proposes the following ,

schedule of salaries: - interna-

- tional president, $115,000; ‘vice-
p1~esident and ., 'secr.etar.y-_.treas- ~‘
   S

$9,300; and international staff
members, $7,800 per year.
Approved, too, was a recom-

Ladies Auxiliaries

Mrs..Kay Thomas of Local
392’s Ladies Auxiliary in Magna,
Utah, who chaired the special"
conference on auxiliaries, in her
report to the convention called
for a program of expansion of
the women’s groups throughout
the union, maintaining that they
were not only
times of emergency, but could
play an important role in the
day-to-day functioning of the 10-
cals and in the various com-
munities. Local union leaders,
said Mrs. Thomas and a reso-
lution that was passed on ladies
auxiliaries, have a responsibility
in getting the women active.

Calling on the international
union to develop prior to the
next convention “a workable
system of per capita payments
by the auxiliaries which will al-
leviate financial hardship on
those with a small membership
and encourage larger auxiliaries

to pay their fair share,” the

resolution asked for a change
now in the constitution to make
dues not less than 25 cents per
month per member, thereby re-
moving the present ceiling on
auxiliary - dues.
Nominal-ions
A parade of some 35 dele-

‘gates streamed to the micro-9

phones to second Skinners nom-
ination, which was made by Roy

Santa Cruz, Jr. from Local 938'

in Superior, Ariz., including
many who said they had op-

posed him in the extremely close“

presidential contest in 1963. See-
onding speeches, too, were ex-
tensive in behalf of Howard, a

Mine-Mill vice-president since"

1953, and Dichter, who became
secretary-treasurer in 1959.

Dennis has served on the '9
union’s executive board since-

1950, Petit-Clair since 1959, Bar-
raza and Rask since 1961, while
Curtis, a board member at sev-
eral different times in the past,

to implement the ambitious pro-
gram adopted by the convention,
calling for expanded organiza-
tional, political and legislative,

 Iiine-Mill Sudbury Win Means

End of Raiding, Says Smith

The meaning of a Mine-Mill victory in Sudbury is “the end of
raiding, not only in Canada, but also in the United States,” said
Canadian President Ken Smith at the international convention in
Denver, predicting that the 16,000 Inco workers would get their
chance to vote by late September or sometime in October.

Filed on May 11, the Mine-Mill petition for a new vote at the
International Nickel Company's huge mining and smelting complex
has been subjected to several _months of painstaking investigation
byvthe Ontario Labor Relations Board. During that time, nothing
of any substance has been discovered that would invalidate the
official count issued by the board which indicated that Mine-Mill
still has over 49 percent of the workers signed up, in spite of the

hiring of several hundred new
employees and the quits or re-

»C‘~tirement of some men who had

signed Mine-Mill cards.

Some 700 voluntary organizers
have been working for the union
in the Sudbury campaign, Smith
reported.

Drastic Shift

Pointing out that prior to
1963, when Steel won aidisputed
election at Sudbury by a scant
15 votes, Inco workers had en-
joyed a 10 cents an hour wage
differential over the employees
at Cominco, he said that now
the differential is some 22 to 29
cents per hour in the other
direction.

The realization that 1965 is an
excellent year for bargaining,
Smith said, is a prime reason
that Inco workers are anxious
that the vote be taken soon.
Mine-Mill could bargain with
the company this year if elected
as bargaining agent, while the
present Steel contract still has
a year to run.

Noting that the Sudbury
workers have fallen from sec-
ond place in earnings and con-
ditions in Canadian industry
under Mine-Mill to 17th place

'€%~”“under the Steelworkers, the

convention delegates pledged
the all-out support of the un-
ion to bring about a successful
conclusion to the Sudbury cam-
paign.

In his report, Smith empha-
sized that the Canadian union’s
activities were not at all co.n-
fined only to the Inco campaign.
He outlined last year’s Cominco
settlement, which included a re-
duction in the work week to 40

hours and premium pay for
weekend work — items which
have since been extended by
law to all industry in British
Columbia. I -

'He said the union had been
quite successful on the legisla-
tive front, having made gains
in mine safety and in other
areas on a provincial basis. He
thanked the international execu-
tive board, the Anaconda work-
ers in the United States, and
the other Mine-Mill locals
throughout the country for their
assistance in winning the
lengthy strike by Local 663 at
Britannia Beach.

Prospects Good
For Organization

Declaring that Mine-Mill is
still the only union in the North-
west Territories and the Yukon,
Smith noted the tremendous ex-
pansion of the mining industry
into those areas and indeed
throughout all of Canada. Pos-
sibilities for organization, he
said, are extraordinary.

Noting the success that Mine-
Mill has had in the past year
in organizational campaigns in
which it has been involved, con-
vention delegates adopted a
resolution calling on the inter-
national to put more effort and
money into organizing the un-
organized worker. Saying that
the need is great particularly in
the South, the resolution stated
that “in most parts of the
country many unorganized
plants . . . pose a constant
threat to the wage standards
and working conditions of the
organized workers.”

Pledged for Two Strikes

Two Mine-Mill strikes which began in the middle of’
July——one at the AS&Ri Company’s Ground Hog mine
in Vanadium, N. M. and its mill at Deming; the other
against the Humboldt (Kansas) Brick and Tile Company
—-were fully supported by delegates to the union’s con-
vention last month in Denver. .

Unanimously approved was a resolution that directs
the Mine-Mill executive board to provide to the strikers
“the necessary support, both morally and financially, to
enable them to win their struggles.” In both cases, the
resolution stated, the workers had no alternative but to

strike “after weeks of futile
bargaining with companies that
seemed determined to try to
force substandard agreements
down their throats.”

Some 120 workers, members.
of Local 890, the Amalgamated
Bayard District Union, walked‘
out on July 16 at the American
Smelting and Refining. proper-
ties in New Mexico. The com-
pany has been attempting to
maintain a wage scale close to
that in effect when the mine
was closed down eight years
ago.

It was re-opened late last.

year, and Mine-Mill again was
certified as the bargaining
agent when the union defeated
the United Steelworkers of
America in an NLRB election in
February. ‘

In Humboldt, where Local 570

struck on July 15, the company a

is obviously out to destroy the
union. Far from giving any con-
sideration to the union’s pro-
posals, the company took. the
position from the start that it

wouldn’t even renew the old con-»
tract, which expired on June 1-,

The company says it is seeking
some 22 changes which would,
in effect, take away all of the
benefits gained by the local in‘
its 25-year history.

Humboldt Brick and Tile last
year came across with a seven
cents an hour wage hike, after

a two-week strike by the some ’

35 employees. . ‘
Although no further bargain-

ing sessions are scheduled at

either site, the workers are ac-

tive building support for the-
walk-outs and their spirits re-

main high. As noted in the con-
Vention resolution, “these work-
ers are determined to fight to
the finish to win decent and hon-
orable contracts.”

Where is the Pie of Yesteryear?

Frozen fruit pies just aren’t what they used to be. That’s not
nostalgic reminiscence but scientific fact. Test findings in the
September issue of CONSUMER REPORTS reveal that both the

quality and Weight of frozen fruit pies have declined drastically ‘

in recent years.

In March 1959, 18 of 30 brands of frozen apple or peach pies
were rated Excellent. This means that when baked according to
directions, they were judged equivalent to high-quality homemade
pies.

But in the current ratings of apple, cherry, andpeach pies,
only two of 27 products, selected from the offerings of the major
frozen pie packers, were rated Excellent; 13 were Good, andthe
balance were rated Fair or even lower. Some of the pies were
too thin and runny. Some contained too little fruit, or fruit that
was blemished or mushy.

The pies tend to weigh less, too. Six years ago an eight-inch
pie weighed 24 ounces. But in the current tests, pies of this size
ranged from 24 ounces down to 20L-and they were all packed in
almost identical-sized cartons.

If you like lots of filling, read the label and avoid 20-ounce
Most of them had, by weight, more crust than filling.

Merchants of Debt-

Consumer credit is no longer a sales tool;.c.it is, more typically,
the purpose of the sale. Where dealers used. to give credit to make
a profit through a sale, they now sell to make a- profit on the credit.
In such a deal, the sale of goods is only a pretext to get the buyer's
signature on an installment contract.

The dealer can make more money on credit than he does on
the goods, says CONSUMER REPORTS in its September issue.
There are all sorts of opportunities for profit. ' ‘ '

First, there is the interest pack. Most dealers ﬁnance their
installment contracts with a lender-—,a bank or sales finance com-
pany. The lender may charge the dealer, say, 12% true annual
interest—but the dealer may charge his customer 14%, 18%, 24%,
or more." The difference is generally used to establish a special
“dealer reserve” held by the lender to protect him from loss in
case the customer-defaults. The dealer collects it as profit after
the account is p-aid off.

There are more plums: insurance, for example. The contract
may include premiums for life, accident, or disability insurance.
The dealer gets a commission on each policy, and he would also
collect any dividends.

Other possibilities for profit are late payment charges, col-
lection fees, the possibility of more and higher interest should the
borrower have to refinance the loan, and prepayment charges in
case the borrower pays ahead of time.

Few signers of installment contracts realize how completely
they are pledging their total resources. Lenders and sellers take
less risk than one might suppose, for they can go to court to col-
lect even after they repossess the goods bought on the installment
plan, if they don’t get all that was due on a resale.

The borrower pays all collection costs. A debt of a few hundred
dollars can be escalated into thousands by legal and collection
charges. .

Installment buying constitutes a growing burden on American
families. Currently, 14% of disposable family income is tied up
in debt repayment. But only about half of the families have any
installment debt; therefore these families have pledged, on the
average, 28% of their disposable income for repayment. Many,
of course, have pledged much more. Many are in serious trouble.

One sign of trouble is the bankruptcy rate. It has risen rapidly
over the last 20 years, _and the percentage of family bankruptcies
also has risen. Today, more than 90% of bankruptcies are con-
sumer rather than business failures.

Another increasing trend is the use of a second mortgage to
pay off consumer debt. By this means a family liquidates its home
equity, built up over the years, to meet short-term financial needs.
A high price maybe paid for such a loan; though the interest rate
may be only 6% to 12%, other costs like brokerage fees, finder’s
fees, and investigation costs often are charged. The example is

pies.

given of a debtor who, in return for a $9595 mortgage note, re--’

ceived only $4892.
Federal investigation is needed, says CONSUMER REPORTS.
“Debt is sold by precisely the sameethical standards as those

that characterize the promotion of the cold cure, the headaches

remedy, the weight reducer, the cigarette, the detergent, and the
hair ointment.

“The family induced into overcommitment . . . is . . . in deep-

trouble. A growing number of such families are being subjected to

. theharsh and socially divisive experiences of the debt collection

process . . .
. “What is called for is . . . a serious and careful investigation
at the highest Federal level into the human as well asthe financial,

the ethical as well as the economic, aspect of this credit game in

which the cards are so heavily stacked by the strong against the
weak, by the cunning against the trusting."

'34 IF it

Cooking Thermometers‘

It’s hard to find a reliable cooking thermometer, says CON-
SUMER REPORTS. Tests of 14 candy and deep-frying models
are reported in the September issue. The most accurate thermoma
eter tested, that had range broad enough both for candy and deep-
fat frying, had maximum inaccuracies of 2° to 4° in the samples
tested. Such variations were considered acceptable, but some other
thermometers were much less accurate. Errors as high as 2?“
were found—-yet an error of even 5° could spoil the consistency of
homemade candy. "

One way to test a cooking thermometer at home is to im~
merse it in vigorously boiling water; it‘ should read,212° at sea

level (a little less at higher altitudes). If it’s higher or lower than

212°, you can add or subtract that amount from your required
cooking temperature. But this test. may not help you in the 400°
deep-fat frying range, because the error may not be consistent
over the whole scale. ’ C ,

Besides‘ accuracy, consider convenience. Models marked 5“
apart are easier to read accurately than those marked only a 10°
intervals. Also, dial thermometers are easier to read than glass-

ecolumn thermometers-—but the, best of the full-range dial-thermom-,

eters was less accurate than t-heibest of the g1as.s;golunm‘ones. ,.

Report Describes New Recovery Process
Co1orado’s Industrial Development Board haslissued a report

on a new mineral recovery process which it claims could mean

millions of dollars in income for the mining industry in the state.

The report describes a new and untried process of chemical re-

fin_‘ing'o_f ‘metals to replace conventionalore smelting." Itsays the‘

pr‘oc'ess_‘would start with crushing, grinding, and concentrating of"
metallic ores in conventional mills and concentrators. Then the
concehtrates are pumped directly into, a pressure vessel,‘where
high temperatures and pressures accelerate an acid bleaching
process. Most of the metal values would go into solution and would
then be purified and extracted by chemicalprocesses. Advantages

claimed for the new process are simplicity and cleanliness. There,

would be no ﬂue dust or fumes as with conventional smelters. ,
Plants could be small. An economical size operation projected

calls for a chemical refining; unit to process 125 tons per day of’

concentrates. Located close to small mines, such plants we-uldoffer

ab. Utah to Be Di cussed-

Two Years After Tragedy Claiming 18 lives

A recent item in the Salt Lake Tribune reports that the Utah State Industrial Commission and -

-Texas Gulf Sulphur Company representatives will soon meet to discuss the sinking of a second
shaft at the company’s potash mine near Moab, Utah. Thisslarge mine is now served by a single
4 divided shaft providing both intake and outlet for the mine ventilation system. ~
The news that sinking of a second shaft is to be “discussed” comes two years after the tragic
explosion of August 27, 1963 at the Moab mine, which claimed the lives of 18 miners trapped under-
ground. In its report on its investigation of this disaster, the U. S. Bureau of Mines recommended
that “a second opening to the underground workings should be provided as soon as possible, so
that sufficient airways and a second escapeway are available.” Apparently the company has taken
no action to date with regard to this recommendation.
’ No such recommendation was contained in the report on the disaster by the Utah Industrial
Commission. The report notes, however, that while the mine was still in the planning stage, the

commission
been mined to make possible
estimates of extraction per-

, centages, g r o u n d conditions,
etc., and to develop a mining
plan.”

The Utah General Safety Or- I

ders for metal and non-metallic
mines, effective July 1, 1963,
provide that “where practical,
every mine operator shall pro-
vide at least two distinct and
available means of access to
~the surface. Under conditions
where it is impractical to have
two outlets, operations may be
permitted with only one outlet
under such conditions as the In-
dustrial Commission may pre-
scribe.” A substantially similar
provision was included in the
general safety orders in effect

A prior to July 1, 1963.

Neither the Industrial- Com-
mission nor the U. S. Bureau of
Mines in their reports offered
any judgment as to how many
trapped miners might have es-
caped with their lives on Au-
gust 27, 1963 if a second escape-
way had been available. Most
of the doomed men were
trapped in a drift inby the shop
area where the explosion origi-

A nated, and the shaft ‘station.

. The mine at Moab went into
production’ about a year ago. A

- shakeup in the Utah State In-

dustrial Commission following
the election of Governor Calvin
L. ,Rampton last November may
have led to belated renewal of
the Commission’s interest in the
question of a second shaft. In

" the s h a k e u p, Commissioner .

Casper A. Nelson was replaced
by John R. Schone, while Com-
missioner Carlyle F. Gronning
replaced Otto A. Wiesley as
chairman of the commission.

‘ Colorado report the Democratic
Congressman to be stirred up
over an article in the August
Mine-Mill Union headlined
“Wayne Aspinall Attempting to

‘, -ing August 12 that he had not

gpatch frjom Washington: 
.“Aspinall said. that. the latest

“ ‘=1-ivT£eP0rts-‘.9f:_a‘hande  
of th: "S. reta7r'y-!of-

authorized Texas Gulf Sulphur “to defer sinking a second shaft until sufficient ore had

eral mine safety laws, and which
did just that.
“ ‘So the bill is based on one

of the biggest shams of all. The .

union leaders will use the bill to

put themselves in a better bar-'

gaining position relative to the
mine operators,’ Aspinall said.
This motive in their drive for
the bill is at least as strong as
their desire to get it approved
by Congress, he indicated.”

Load Limits
A panel of 12 experts estab-
lished by the International La-
bor Organization has recom-
mended that the maximum per-
missible load carried by an

‘adult male worker should be

88 pounds. The standard has
been put forward for world-wide
adoption. The ILO has been
considering the question of load
limits since 1914 when it recom-
mended a maximum load limit
for longshoremen of 132 pounds.
No action on this recommenda-
tion has resulted since that
time. ’

Most of the experts felt that

women and boys 16 to 18 years —

old should be limited to be-
tween 33 and 44 pounds.

Pneumoconiosis
Facts Bured

Dr. Murray C. Brown, U. S.
Public Health Service, reports
in Mining _Congress Journal for
August preliminary findings of
the Public Health. Service-U. S.
Bureau of Mines survey of
pneumoconiosis among bitumi-
nous coal miners. .Knowledge
that the disease existed among
U. S. coal miners became avail-
able only after records of min-
ers at medical clinics in the
Appalachian region were re-
viewed.

The PHS-Bureau of Mines sur-
vey teams started about two
years ago in the Appalachian
region and made x-ray lung
studies of 2,549 actively em-
ployed soft coal miners and
1,553 unemployed and retired
miners.

Analysis of the x-ray films re-

vealed that nearly one out of
every ten soft coal miners work-
ing in Appalachia had pneumo-
coniosis. Among unemployed
and retired miners, about one
in every five, or 20 percent,
had pneumoconiosis.

About three percent of the
active miners and nine percent
of the inactive miners had
progressed from simple pneu-
moconiosis to a more compli-

cated stage, called progressive .

massive fibrosis. This state is
characterized by massive de-
struction of lung tissue and se-
vere emphysema (shortening of
breath). Dr. Brown states,
“Once this process begins, it
progresses rapidly and steadily,
causing an incapacitating de-
gree of breathlessness, usually
resulting in death from heart
failure, asphyxia or pneumonia.

Separating the findings ac-
cording to age and years under-

ground gave even more startling ’

results. More than 20 percent
of the employed miners aged 55
to 64 years had pneumoconiosis.
The proportion of cases was
found to increase sharply in
groups of miners with more
than 20 years underground.

Pneumoconiosis manifests it-
self by nodules on the lungs
(fibrosis), often complicated by
bronchitis and gradual destruc-
tion of the lung tissue. The
findings of the survey indicate
that the disease is closely as-
sociated with exposure to coal
dust. Dr. Brown recommends
stronger measures to control
dust in soft coal mines as a
step in the right direction.

Dr. Brown concludes, “Occu-
pational respiratory diseases
are the second highest cause of
compensable disease in the U.S_.
and continue to deprive industry
of years of trained and produc-
tive labor. All indications are
that the results of this investi-
gation on coal workers’ pneu-
moconiosis will far surpass any-
thing that has yet been done to
eradicate this threat to the
health of workers.” .

Two Omaha Wourkmenf.
Winners in Aribitrartion ,

OMAHA," Neb. —- The Omaha
Smeltermen’s Union, Mine-Mill
Local 461, won an unusual griev-
ance late in July, when Arbi-
trator Philip G. Marshall ruled
that two maintenance employees
in the mechanical department
of the AS&R plant here were
each entitled to six hours call-
back pay at time-and-a-half al-
though they remained at the
plant only two and a half-hours

after their regular quittingtime. .

Neither the spokesmen for the

, union and the company nor the

arbitrator could find any re-
ported previous instance of a
similar grievance.

The contract provision on
which the" decision was based
says, “Maintenance employees
reporting on call to do emer-
gency repair work during hours
when such employees are not
regularly scheduled
guaranteed a minimum of three
hours pay at one and one half
times their regular hourly rate
of pay.” Company and union
agreed 10 years ago that no
regular maintenance work would
be done during call-backs.

William Havene-r and Francis
Pfeife-r, the two grievants in this
case, were stopped at the guard-
house on their way home on
Nov. 20, 1964 and asked to re-
pair an oil leak that had been
discovered in a pipeline. They
punched back in at 4:15 p.m.,
completed the emergency work,
and punched out again at 4:53.

On returning to the shower

‘shall be

they noticed that the water was

gcold and decided that the trou-
ble was a gas failure, which;

they reported to the suptervisor.

The head of the «mechanical‘,de—.
Apartment authorized the two‘
men to make the repair. Hav-_~‘

ener and Pfeife-r punched back

in at 5:46, did the work, and-.
punched out. at 6:24. They had
spent 38 minutes on each of the - -

jobs and about two and a half

hours" at the plant past their '

normal quitting time.
‘ Two Call-bucks '. ’

Local 461 said that the two-'_
men were entitled to be credited.
with two separate call--backs,‘

contending‘ that had the gas

failure been discovered after,
. they left, the company would

have had to call somebody to
make the repair.

Marshall, in ruling for the
union, said that no. exception
should be made in the contract
language, despite the lucky cir-

cumstances which permitted the _ A

two workers to make two emer-
gency repairs in less time than
the guaranteed minimum pay
for one such repair.

Jess Van Camp, international
representative, appeared for the
union in the arbitration, along

with Richard Schill, Local 461-

president; Eugene Fenderson,

chief shop steward; Sam Hicks,.
