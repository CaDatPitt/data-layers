the list to be proscribed. The cry of “foreign agents” against
them, and their prosecution on various technical charges,
is used as a smokescreen for much wider purposes of de-
struction just as in the early days of our republic Jefferson,
Franklin and others were dubbed “foreign agents” by the
rich tories.

While the drive is on in the East we note that another
Federal arm, the U.S. Department of Labor, moves to annul
the citizenship of William Schneiderman of California be-
cause of his membership in the Communist Party. If this
can be done, then the citizenship of anyone can be can-
celled for any belief or aﬁiliation that may be unpopular
with a judge or a Secretary of Labor.

This is happening in California where Samuel Darcy,
also, State Secretary of the Communist Party of Eastern
Pennsylvania, is to be tried on technical charges, revived
after four years. They were described by a Federal District
Judge before whom proceedings to stop extradition were
brought, as ﬂimsy, technical and non-material.

3. The announcement by Assistant Attorney-General
Thurman Arnold of a series of prosecutions of labor under
the anti-trust laws, already under way in Indianapolis and
Detroit in the form of indictments against A. F. of L. unions.
On November 19, 1939, Arnold, in a letter to the Indian-
apolis Central Labor Union, declared that he would prose-
cute under the anti-trust laws any labor acts designed to
(1) prevent the use of cheaper [scab] material, improved
equipment or more efﬁcient methods [speed-up, for exam-
ple]; (2) compel the hiring of unnecessary labor [to avoid
speed-up, say, or for safety as in the full crew laws on rail-
roads]; (3) “destroy an established and legitimate system
of collective bargaining” [no matter how antiquated it may
be in respect to representation, wages and working con-
ditions].

4. A campaign of government espionage on labor activ-
ity of all kinds, in collaboration with big manufacturers.

‘This includes repetition of Dies’ slanders in regard to the

loyalty of Detroit auto workers, and ofﬁcial approval of the

10

 

  

Cleveland, Ohio, reward of $500 posted by manufacturers
for “espionage and sabotage" disclosures.

This is how the Justice branch of the Federal government
opens its drive to supplement the work of Dies. It plans to
put people in jail with accompanying headlines, instead of
destroying their reputations with innuendoes and baseless
charges screamed across’ the front pages of the country's
newspapers. The procedure is slightly different, but the
basic aim—weakening of the labor and progressive and
anti-war forces—is identical.

Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hoover have improved on the
infamous Attomey-General A. Mitchell Palmer with his
war-time raids, arrests and illegal seizures. Where he prose-
cuted and persecuted on political grounds, they proceed
on technical non-political grounds—alleged passport viola-
tions, failure to register as “foreign agents,” criminal con-
spiracy (Minneapolis), anti-trust law violation——in the midst
of an artiﬁcially created atmosphere of political hysteria
against their victims.

“There will be no violation of civil liberties,” says Mr.
Murphy, and proceeds on the lines outlined above.

There isn’t much choice in this matter between Mr. Dies
and the Department of Justice. Both tactics are ultimately
subversive of the Bill of Rights.

LEGISLATION FOR REACTION

Of utmost importance to the Wall Street forces that want
to remove the protection of the National Labor Relations
Act from trade unions and the protection of the Social Se-
curity Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act from workers,
is legislation which will ﬁrst of all break down the powers
of resistance of labor and progressives. Consciousness of
their constitutional power to speak, to write, to publish, to
organize, to meet, is essential to the well-being of the people.
To take that right away would put us back into the eigh-

ll

 

   
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
   

teenth century when the American people fought for their
Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitu-
tion of the United States. ,

' The Big Business crowd that applauds Dies, Murphy and

their stool—pigeons today fully realizes that the road to

larger proﬁts lies through lower wages, lengthened hours
and less liberty for the workers and the people generally.
They realize also that war has always been proﬁtable for
Big Business in spite of the many and well-publicized‘ cur-
rent assertions to the contrary. War also, they have found,
is an excellent excuse for depriving everyone except them-
selves of rights and privileges guaranteed under the Con-
stitution.

Acting as direct legislative agents for these capitalist
interests, the Garner-Dies-Republican crowd have stewed
up a mess of bills calculated to choke the Bill of Rights.
Some of them have already become half-law by passage in
one of the Houses of Congress. Others are still in process
of formulation by Dies and his friends. Some have the
increasingly dubious blessing of the Administration as it
moves swiftly toward the Right.

Many of these laws are‘ aimed at “aliens”—non-natural-
ized foreign~born persons in the United States. The old
rule of “divide and conquer” prevails in‘these measures.
The theory is that if you can set the alien apart from the
citizen you generate friction between the two. Then the
employer who wants to hit the unions or cut wages can
have an easier time of it.

But there is more than that behind this “anti-alien”
drive. A large number of the bills supposedly affecting
only aliens woulddirectly aﬂfect citizens too, although that
is not mentioned in the bills themselves.

Here is a summary prepared by the Washington Bureau
of the International Labor Defense, covering those bills of
this type on which some action was taken in the last session
of Congress. Those not passed are due to be taken up and
pushed again in the current session:

12

  

Enacted into Law:

 

1. Provision of W.P.A. Appropriation Act which forbids

granting of relief to non-citizens.

- 2. The Hatch Bill, generally anti-democratic, -but espe-
cially so in its little-known Section ga. Under this section
any Federal employee accused by a superior, or in whose
accusation a superior might acquiesce, of belonging to an
organization “advocating the overthrow of our constitu-
tional form of government in the United States,” can be
summarily dismissed—and if he can afford it spend large
sums suing for reinstatement. No judicial process is pro-
vided for determining whether the employee's aﬂiliation is
in fact as described.

Passed by the House of Representatives:

1. Dempsey Bill (H.R. 4860) which forbids aliens from
belonging to any organization which advocates “any change
in the American form of government.” It is intended to
gag labor, religious, fraternal, and other groups to which
aliens belong. Forpif such an organization endorsed, for
example, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, it would
run the risk of making non-citizen members deportable.
Passed by trickery without hearing, debate or vote. Now
before Senate Immigration Sub-Committee.

2. Hobbs Concentration Camp Bill (H.R. 5643) intro-
ducing to American jurisprudence the principle of impris-
onment for life without trial. While in fact affecting very
few aliens, its sponsors, once the bill becomes a law, look
forward to extension of the principle to other political op-
ponents. Favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, but not acted upon in the higher body.

3. McC0rmack Federal Criminal Syndicalism Amendment
(H.R. 6075, Walter Espionage Bill, Sec. 2). This creates a
new Federal crime: advocacy of the “overthrow of the gov-
ernment of the United States by force and violence.” The
wording is almost identical with that of state criminal syn-
dicalism statutes which have heretofore been used in charges
that organizing unions and preparing strikes was “attempt”
or “conspiracy to” overthrow the government by force and

13

 

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   

violence. That is the difference between legal language and
the American language.

4. Smith Omnibus Gag Bill (H.R. 5138) contains the
substance of the McCormack amendment above, expanded
into ten times as many and even looser words; forbids pub-
lication of anything that might conceivably, if he happened
to see it, make a soldier or sailor dissatisﬁed, and provides
for search of any premises upon suspicion that there might
be such literature there to seize; provides that aliens enter-
ing the country be ﬁngerprinted like criminals; widens the
base of deportation of aliens. After passage by the House
this bill was reported favorably by the Senate Immigration
Committee.

Recommended for Passage by Senate Committees:
1. Hobbs Concentration Camp Bill (See above).
2. Smith Omnibus Bill (See above).

3. Reynolds Bill (S. 409) providing for stoppage of im-
migration for ﬁve years (aimed at refugees), and providing
for registration of all aliens and issuance to them of identi~
ﬁcation cards, renewable periodically. Purpose is to lay
basis for a domestic passport system under which all persons
in the United States would have to register and obtain
permission to move out of their own homes. The Depart-
ment of Labor has pointed out that such a rovision ap-
plied only to aliens would be unenforceable. Citizens would
have to carry identiﬁcation as citizens to avoid detention
as unregistered aliens. This bill was reported favorably by
Senate Immigration Committee. It is only one of a group of
bills introduced by Senator Robert Rice Reynolds of North
Carolina.

4. Stewart Alien Registration Bill (S. 2830) provides for
registration of aliens, its wording differs from that of the
Reynolds Bill. Reported favorably by the Senate Committee
on Immigration. Only a threat of a ﬁlibuster by Sen. Lewis
B. Schwellenbach prevented passage of Stewart Bill.

5. Holman Resolution (S. Res. 168) to investigate work-
ings of immigration laws. Sponsored by Sen. Rufus Holman
of Oregon. By parenthood and wording a Senate equivalent
in its limited ﬁeld of the Dies Committee in the House.

14

   

Recommended by Senate Immigration Committee with
$50,000 appropriation. Reported out by Committee to
Audit and Control Contingent Expenses with $10,000
appropriation.

Already in the legislative hoppers are dozens of similar
bills. The Dies Committee, the Hearst press and scores of
organizations like the Silver Shirts, the Coughlin-controlled
Christian Mobilizers and Christian Front, and the Knights
of the White Camellia, together with the leaders of many
fascist anti-Semitic groups masquerading as “patriotic so-
cieties,” are pressing for their passage. The National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers is lending them aid and comfort.

Among these bills, for example, are others similar to the
Reynolds Bill requiring the ﬁnger-printing and registration
of all aliens. There are in fact eight alien registration bills
pending in the 76th Congress. The decision of the Federal
District Court in Pennsylvania, November 30, 1939, hold-
ing that the Pennsylvania Alien Registration Law, passed
in June, 1939, is unconstitutional, does not remove the
danger of a Federal law. For the court only passed on the
question of whether a state could constitutionally pass
such a law.

Still other bills which would outlaw any organization
considered “un-American” by a Dies are on the list to be
brought up at the 1940 session along with bills speciﬁcally
outlawing the Communist Party which are now reported
to have the secret support of the Roosevelt government.
Outlawing of the Communist Party would undoubtedly be
the ﬁrst step toward the banning of non-Communist organ-
izations and labor groups, as well as an opening wedge for
legislation against other anti-war elements.

ATTACKS ON THE LABOR ACT

The ersistent attacks u on the National Labor Rela-
. P . P .
trons Act, and the National Labor Relations Board ap-
pointed to administer it, is one of the best examples of

organized employer attempts to destroy_any measure that
adds to the welfare of industrial workers.

‘I? When the N.L.R.A. was ﬁrst passed in 1935, employer
 resistance crystallized around the Liberty League, and for
;§; nearly two years the beneﬁts that labor was supposed to
obtain from the Act were withheld by litigation intended
3 to obstruct justice and to kill the measure by having it
declared unconstitutional.

When ﬁnally it was declared constitutional by the United
States Supreme Court in April, 1937, every anti—labor
; agency, including the Liberty League, the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce of the
 U. S., the Associated “Farmers,” and every big employer
. 1;. immediately began to agitate for its amendment. At the
flu same time they continued by sabotaging tactics to harass
 the Board with court litigation.

9 The ﬁght for amendments to emasculate the Act, to
make it, in fact, an anti—labor instrument, was carried on
,1 side by side with a ﬁght to change its administrative per-
 sonnel, to put it into the hands of persons who would use
it, even as it stands, against labor. That ﬁght almost came
to a head in the 1939 session of Congress. Only the most
determined opposition by labor and its friends prevented
action on the crippling amendments by ‘a hostile Congress.

This ﬁght will probably come to a head in the 1940

session. The House committee to “investigate” the National
Labor Relations Board, headed by Representative Howard
VV. Smith, a Virginia banker, is now at work producing the
4 required atmosphere.
 The tactics of the Smith Committee as it opens its ses~
"L sions are in many respects similar to those of the Dies
Committee. In its preparatory work, the Committee has
9 been lawless and unfair. Its counsel, Edmund M. Toland,
I‘ formerly an attorney for labor spy agencies and big indus—
‘ t-rial concerns in the Liberty League drive against the
Board, has issued subpoenas for witnesses to bring their
ﬁles before the Committee when actually the Committee
was not sitting. The range of material demanded of the»
16

 

,,.....

 

  

National Lawyers’ Guild, for example, was entirely outside
the powers given the Committee by Congress. In this case
the Guild successfully resisted the subpoena.

Preliminary to opening its hearings the Committee sent
out thousands of questionnaires to unions, business men,
chiefs of police and other oﬂicials as well as college profes-
sors. While no one outside the Committee has examined
the list, it seems obviously weighted against labor. Statistics
of opinion as to the value of the N.L.R.A., drawn from the
total list, are predetermined against the Act. Besides this,
Smith must know quite well what sort of answers he will
obtain from police officials, notoriously employed against
labor, to such leading questions as whether the Act has
brought an increase in violence in labor disputes. Thou-

sands of case records studied by the International Labor ‘

Defense show clearly that violence in labor disputes comes
in less than 1 per cent of cases from labor.

The Smith Committee is obviously the spearhead of the
drive against the N.L.R.A. The efforts of the big labor-
baiting monopoly interests to cripple the Act with amend-
ments will be greatly aided by the job this Committee is
performing.

THE SPREADING TENTACLES

Ever since the American Revolution there have been
those who considered that freedom of speech, press and
assemblage was an interference with their right to proﬁt.
Even before the beginning of the nineteenth century, we
had General Hamilton forming an army of 15,000 men to
combat the‘ popular movement that resulted in the adop-
tion of the Bill of Rights as part of our Constitution.

Now we have the war-makers and their legislative tools
rnobilizing to destroy that Bill of Rights. This movement
is countrywide and ominous. It is much further advanced
than it was ‘at the corresponding period before the United
States became involved in the last imperialist war.

rice A. Fitzgerald designates 1,200 special deputies as a
vigilante force to “prevent subversive movements.” In Kings
County (Brooklyn), Sheriff James A. Mangano announces
the formation of a “Sheriff's Emergency Force” for similar
purposes. No numbers are announced but an invitation is
extended to all citizens of Brooklyn over twenty-one “of
good reputation.”

In the South as well as in the North we ﬁnd the Ku Klux
Klan renewing activity, revising its program to fit the grow-
ing anti-red hysteria. “Father” Cough1in’s anti-Semitic
racket continues unabated in spite of the brilliantly docu-

’ mented exposures of John L. Spivak—and the U.S. Depart-

ment of Justice refuses to doa thing about it.

On the VVest Coast, any bank officer whose institution
holds a mortgage on a farm is a “farmer" so far as eligibility
to belong to the anti-labor “Associated Farmers” is con-
cerned. Under the guidance of this group similar organ-

izations with names suited to local conditions are being

organized throughout the country.

The anti-democratic and anti-labor purposes of the As-
sociated Farmers and kindred organizations are being re-
vealed by the tireless and effective investigations of the
Civil Liberties (LaFollette) Committee of the U. 8. Senate,
almost the only bright spot in the civil rights picture of the
last three years. If one wants to get the ﬂavor of peace-
time violations of labor’s right to bargain collectively in

order to appreciate the hundred-fold suppressive activities

of war-time, nothing could be more sobering than to leaf
through the documented evidence dug up, despite inade-
quate appropriations, by this truly American committee.
Or we can turn for evidence of the growing fascist trend
to the spokesmen of the industrialists themselves, for exam-
ple to C. C. Crow, editor of Crow’: Paciﬁc Coast Lumber
Digest. The statement below is an open expression of the
incitement to vigilante activity against labor now being
planned by the open shoppers in the West Coast lumber
industry. It is taken from Crow’s magazine and quoted in
the Voice of the Federation, December 7, 1939.
18

  

  

“There should be an interstate vigilante society formed
with a closely knitted body that could act as a man from
the Canadian border to the Mexico line.

“This should be made up of American citizens only and
it would be possible to bring such pressure to bear and ive
such moral and physical support to the regional law-enl§)rc-
ing bodies of t e Paciﬁc Coast that Harry Bridges and
others of his type could be removed, regardless of Stalin
and Madame Perkins.

“The Paciﬁc Coast has waited long enough and it is now

. time to take action independent of the Federal govern-

ment. . . .

“Oregon, Washington and California still have their
state, county and municipal governments that are function-
ing. . . . The time has come for action, militant action. . . .
The time has come for the people to form a vigilante gang
so representative and strong that they may go to their
regularly constituted regional law-enforcing officers and not
only ask for protection against this foreign invasion but
demand it.” (My emphasis——R.D.)

What is this “foreign invasion” that is so dreadful that
Crow wants to defy all law, order and government to op-
pose it with a vigilante gang? Nothing more or less than
the labor movement proceeding in its lawful course to seek

collective bargaining and an improvement in the condi- V

tions of workers.

During the first World War the Paciﬁc Northwest lum-
ber country was the center of probably the bloodiest anti-
union repression in the country. And on December 2, 1939,
in Aberdeen, Washington, a mob of about 200 men, organ-
ized by the local Chamber of Commerce, protected by the
police, raided and completely smashed the Finnish Workers
Hall—which for purposes of the raid they labeled Commu-
nist. They then proceeded to C.I.O. and A. F. of L. head-
quarters and smashed them too.

A few weeks later vigilante agents of the lumber inter-
ests raided the home of Richard Law, C.l.O. organizer, and
killed his wife while he was away at a union meeting. A

From the hundreds of reports that have come to the na-
tional office of the International Labor Defense we ﬁnd
further evidence of the nationwide threat to trample on
traditional American rights. Here are a few instances of
violations of these rights that have come to our attention
in the three months, September, October, November, 1939.
They include a wide range of interference with constitu-
tional guarantees as well as various types of vigilante terror,
kidnappings, frame-ups, injunctions and prosecutions. For
convenience they are classiﬁed here into actions against
labor, more speciﬁc anti—Communist moves, and the grow-
ing terror of the night shirt brigades of the hated Ku Klux
Klan, especially against the Negro people:

TO KEEP EQUAL JUSTICE IN THE LAW

It is a rather gloomy picture ‘we have given in this
pamphlet. But to go back to the years immediately fol-
lowing the American Revolution, when Tories sought to
continue in the young Republic the tyrannies from which
the colonists had ﬂed—that was a gloomy picture, too. They
wondered then, as people wonder now, how they could lick
this thing, and who would lick it? The answer then is just
as true today: it can be licked by those against whom it is
directed, in other words, by the people of the United States.

Labor, for example, can lick Dies. How?

If every. union local in the United States will send a reso-
lution to its Congressman opposing continuation of the
Dies Committee; if only one—half of the voters among union
men and theirwives will follow this up with similar, per-
sonal handwritten letters to their Congressmen, the un-

27

 

‘ '« 5' v"‘i=v’~'3“!S’lW‘3<‘.Tﬂ‘$I'~‘lI8>‘3X;VﬂIIIb0‘V;'-'r<‘~ ". M '~ ' ’ -v- ' -»~—- v

American Committee of the 76th Congress would be beaten
back like the Tories in ’76.

Practically half the people of the United States are or-
ganized in one way or another.-They belong to a union, a
church, a society, a fraternal society, a social club, a po-
litical club, an association of one kind or another. Many
belong to several.

The thing that must be done now is to enlist every such
organization in its own way for the preservation of the Bill
of Rights now threatened by the economic royalists com-
bining with the Roosevelt government.

Already the labor movements in many places—in Port- ~.‘
land, Oregon, and in Iowa, for example—are calling wide  .
conferences of unions to set up apparatus for defense of 3.
civil rights.

International unions, prominent among them the Ameri-
can Newspaper Guild, have instructed all their locals to
form legislative committees, which will not only take up the
legislative aspects of direct union problems, but questions
concerning the civil liberties of all the people of whom
members of these unions are a part.

There shouldn't be a labor union local without its de-
vfense, its civil ‘rights or its bail committee. And its represen-
tative should be on a central directing agency of unions and
other organizations so that an attack on one becomes a
matter for defense by all. Where there are no such
central agencies they should be created by conferences of
representatives of unions and other progressive organiza-
tions vitally interested in the preservation of the Bill of
Rights, in the courts and in legislative bodies.

Besides, every union local or progressive organization
should have some sort of legislative committee to study the
problems that arise in the defense of civil rights in Wash-
ington and in the state capitals, to take action without
delay and to recommend action to the body as a whole and
its individual members.

In legislative matters the passage of a resolution by a
body should always be followed up by action by the indi-

28

 

 

 

   

vidual members, their famiiles, friends and acquaintances,
writing to their own Congressmen and Senators. The lan-
guage of their own constituency is the only popular
language that legislators understand.

The International Labor Defense, through its Washing-
ton Bureau and its regular legislative letters will undertake
to keep you informed of Congressional developments which
threaten democratic rights, or possible' action to stop such
developments from maturing, or to strengthen the ﬁght for
a piece of progressive legislation that will implement the
Bill of Rights. It's true there is no newspaper or magazine
in the country that gives this information in an adequate
manner. That's why the I.L.D. provides this service which

no other agency even approaches in completeness and time-
liness.

Whaf fo Do NOW ‘

Now, when you have read this pamphlet:

Write a letter to your Congressman urging that the Dies
Committee or any other agency with its anti-labor, anti-
progressive aims be discontinued.

Write a letter to your two Senators urging defeat of the
measure described on pages 13 and 14 of this pamphlet.

Follow up with a letter to your Congressman urging the
defeat of the anti—alien, sedition, registration and similar
measures. The I.L.D.’s Washington Bureau Legislative
Letter will keep all who receive it informed of develop-
ments on specific bills as they occur in Congress.

See that your organization passes appropriate resolutions
on these questions, and that the other members are stimu-
lated by these resolutions to write, as voters, individual
letters to their Congressmen.

Try to get your union or other organization to elect
active legislative, defense and bail committees, and to
initiate action by a group of organizations through a con-
ference, as outlined in the previous sections of this
pamphlet.

The Bill of Rights in Danger

HE people of the United States must prepare now to
prevent an assault on their civil rights and liberties
unprecedented in the history of our country.

A year ago such a statement would have seemed—and
been—fantastic. Even then the same Big Business forces
that are behind this drive were hard at work, but their
plans were not complete. The House of Representatives,
for example, introduced and passed measures aimed at
weakening the labor and progressive movement. But the
reactionary forces were not able then to push these measures
into law.

Now the whole picture has changed. The ruling circles
of the United States are determined on following a war
policy, and they seem to know just exactly what paths to
take. Certainly the press propaganda for war and for can-
cellation of the Bill of Rights is more powerful than it
ever was in the period before the United States entered the
first World War. And the destruction of democracy is now
taken for granted as a “war emergency” move. .

The danger is upon us now.

Here are some of the forms taken by the preliminary

preparations in the ﬁeld of civil rights, some of them old,

some of them new, all of them active now:

1. The operations of the Dies Committee which include
most openly in the last few months intervention in labor
union affairs as well as intensiﬁed attempts to smear all pro-
gressive movements and individuals.

2. The double-barrelled attack by the United States De-
artment of Justice upon the trade unions directly in the
orm of anti-trust indictments and threatened prosecutions,

and upon the Communist Party in the form of indictments
not on open political charges but upon shadowy technical

  FROM THE CONSTITUTION or THE |.L.D.

Aims and Principles:

if a. The aims of the International Labor Defense are: Aid

to labor and political prisoners, and victims of reactionary
violence, regardless of race, color, nationality, religious or
political‘ convictions, and the defense of democratic and
civil rights.

I). The International Labor Defense organizes this aid
and defense seekingto draw the greatest possible number
of people into the fulﬁllment of these aims.

(7. The International Labor Defense aids labor and po-
litical prisoners, victims of violence, of reaction, families of
prisoners, widows and orphans of the victims of labor strug-
gles and struggles for democratic rights all over the world.

d. The International Labor Defense as part of its strug-
gle for democratic and civil rights aids and supports the
ﬁ ht a ainst war and fascism.

E 8

e. The International Labor Defense organizes for the
defense of the Negro people and all national minorities
against lynching, oppression. discrimination. and for the
defense of the l’oreign-born against deportation and dis-
crimination, and for the right of political and religious
asylum.

f. The International Labor l)elense cooperates with other
groups and organizations, for aid t.o labor prisoners and for
defense of democratic, civil and individual rights of the

’ people.

g. The International Labor Defense unites all people
interested in these aims, and tolerates no discrimination or
distinction in its ranks on account of race, nationality,
color, or political conviction.

grounds. Together with these, the F.B.l. campaign of
espionage on labor activity, and the prosecution of W.P.A.
workers in Minneapolis.

3. The clamor for enactment into law of about seventy
measures for su pression of the rights of aliens—most of
them in such a ibrm as to threaten as well the civil rights
of citizens-and for the passage of drastic sedition laws
similar to those conceived in the hysteria of the ﬁrst World
War;

6‘

. The 0 erartions of the Smith Committee in its in-
4. . P . .
vestigation” of the National Labor Relations Board.

5. Perfection of the “M-Day Plan” for a blackout of all
democratic rights upon declaration of war, and the steps
already taken to ask Congress to give the President imme-

. diately certain dictatorial powers over labor standards on

the mere declaration of a “national emergency.”

These are the .most outstanding indications of the
mounting wave of intolerance and reaction. Every one of
these moves contributes its part toward creating a state of
public excitement and war hysteria to serve as a smoke-
screen for abrogating the provisions of the Bill of Rights.

The Dies Inquisiﬁon

For nearly two years the spearhead of the attack upon
civil rights and the labor and progressive movement has
been the “Special Committee on Un-American Activities
of the House of Representatives,” headed by Martin Dies
of Texas. This Committee, created under House Resolu-
tion 282 of the 75th Congress, adopted May 26, 1938, has
since been engaged in a vicious un-American campaign to
snipe at every public oﬂicial and every other person in
public life who has manifested the slightest sympathy for
labor, for peace, or for the preservation of civil liberties.

Many studies of the illegal procedure of this Committee
have been issued by impartial authorities. All have agreed
that it has functioned as a sounding board for the most
sinister anti-American forces of the country} The San Fran-
cisco Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, in a 48-page

analysis of the conduct of Dies and his associates (In the

Court of Public Opinion, People of the USA. vs. the Dies ‘

Committee), concluded that the Committee used its hear-
ings

“. . . for the dissemination of irresponsible slanders
against honest public servants and private individuals and
against public-spirited organizations, on testimony consist-
ing of surmise, conjecture, unfounded opinion, unsup-
ported conclusions and unwarranted deductions, without
any attempt at veriﬁcation or conﬁrmation, which no self-
respecting, fact-ﬁnding agency anywhere would con-
sider. . . .”

Brieﬂy, the method of attack of the Committee can be
described as follows: _ -
A witness is placed on the stand where he is permitted

.to make wild, sensational charges against political ﬁgures,

organizations and other individuals. Generally the charge
has been that all these individuals and organizations‘ are
partaking in, or are associated in some way with, plots to
overthrow the government of the United States.

It would require a separate pamphlet of this size simply
to list the persons and organizations against which such
charges of “subversive activity” have been made. They in-
clude hundreds of progressives and liberal government oili-
cials. And they cover dozens of union's, whose officers and
members probably have no idea such charges have been
made, and have never been notiﬁed of the charges or given
any opportunity to reply to the slanders. One member of
Congress was astonished when told that he had been named
as a “Communist” or “fellow-traveler” some months before,
and prior to his election. ~

-In not a single instance have the persons and organiza-
tions so charged been notiﬁed in advance so that they might
be present to answer the charges. In only one case has an
organization actually succeeded in appearing before the
Committee to refute the charges made against it. That was
when, on October 17, 1939, Congressman Vito Marcantonio

5

 

 

E
a

appeared to challenge statements made about the Interna-
tional Labor Defense. The original demand for such an
appearance had been made by Mr. Marcantonio nearly a
year before.

In not a single instance has the Committee demanded of
its friendly witnesses any proof of their groundless gossip.
Such “documents” as have been placed in the record have
been produced by the witnesses themselves and the Com-
mittee has never questioned their authenticity, or called
qualiﬁed witnesses to identify them. y

The purpose of this method is obvious from its result.
No matter how wild a statement may be, no matter how
scandalous or unfounded, once it goes into the ofﬁcial
record of a Congressional Committee, newspapers can
broadcast it without fear of libel suits. Naturally, the news-
papers have seized on this opportunity for sensational
stories without risk or responsibility. The most grotesque

statements before the Committee have therefore made the’

headlines and occupied the greatest amount of space in the
published hearings of the Committee, which up to Decem-
ber 15, 1939, totaled about 4,200 pages.

Generally, the ﬁrst intimation a victim has that such
charges have been made against him comes from the news-
papers. He is then free to deny them, but his denial has not
the same sensational perverted “news value” as the charges,
and is either buried on a back page or ignored.

One of the most scandalous acts of the Committee was
the way in which it attempted to break up the Washington
Branch of the American League for Peace and Democracy.
When the Committee months before had ﬁrst begun to
show an interest in the affairs of the American League, its
national president, Dr. Harry F. Ward, informed the Com-
mittee that the ﬁles of the League were open for inspection
by the Committee's agents, and offered to cooperate in
voluntarily furnishing any material concerning the League
in which the Committee might be interested.

Instead of accepting this offer Dies preferred to “raid,”

as the newspaper headlines put it, the office of the Wash-
6

 

 

 

ington Branch of the League on September 28, 1939, at ii
time when a single volunteer worker was present. The Dies
agent demanded that all membership records be imme-
diately surrendered. When the volunteer worker showed
some reluctance to turn over all the records the Dies agent
replied that he had taken charge of the office and if met
with resistance would bring charges of assault and battery
against the volunteer. Agents of the Committee then seized
certain ﬁles of the organization and put a padlock on them.

Legally all the agents of the Committee had the authority
to do was to serve a subpoena. Instead they were guilty of
trespass, search and seizure without a warrant, and acts
clearly intended to intimidate a responsible and lawful
organization.

Later, Dies published the seized list, a combination of
membership and general mailing list, with a statement im-
plying that all the distinguished public servants included
in the list were “un-American.” But, like a coward, he first
deliberately protected himself and the Committee from
libel action by making the list “an official part of the
record.”

Curiously, when witnesses are called before the Dies Com-
mittee whom it has charged, or intends to charge, are “un-
American,” they are not permitted to read prepared state-
ments as to their views or actions, or even to speak freely
on matters about which they have been accused. Instead
they are obliged to limit themselves to direct answers to
questions whose cumulative effect is the same as the famous
question: “When did you stop beating your wife?"

The late Heywood Broun, president of the Newspaper
Guild; Anna Damon, secretary of the International Labor

. Defense; Dr. Ward of the American League, and a number

of other witnesses had the “ﬁxed Committee rule” against
reading of statements and free explanatory answers invoked
against them. Curiously enough, just a few weeks after the
appearance of Miss Damon, a friendly witness called before
the Committee to make the most hare-brained charges was
permitted to read his entire statement.

7

 

  

 

When the 1939 appropriation for the Dies Committee
was up for consideration, the Roosevelt Administration -did
nothing. Itwas apparently afraid of the blackmail system
under which any opposition to Dies or his methods is cited
as “proof” that the opponent is a “Red.” It was previously
made clear, however, that besmirching the New Deal was an
established policy of Dies and his political advisor, John
Nance Garner, the millionaire banker and presidential
aspirant from Texas.

Now Dies wants to continue his “investigation” for an-
other year, and this time he wants $200,000. It is an open
secret that he plans to use this money to “get” the Congress
of Industrial Organizations and to continue his poisonous
slander campaign against all democratic movements. The
Wall Street journal (Dec. 4, 1939) and other ‘organs of Big
Business are behind his drive to use more of the taxpayer's
money for continuing a witch-hunting inquisition.

The second report of the Dies Committee, January, 1940,
was couched in a more “moderate” tone. But this was only
molasses to catch more ﬂies, a cunning tactic to obtain a
further appropriation. Fundamentally the report was a
slanderous, treacherous document calculated to sow dissen-
sion in the labor and progressive movement and to smear
the Communists further with the “foreign agent” lie.

The Deparlmenf of Jusﬁce Drive

There has been some shadow-boxing between the Ad-
ministration and the Dies Committee—as for example when
President Roosevelt described the procedure of the un-
American group as “sordid.” But itmust be noted also that
there has been no more than that. '

While pursuing a common objective, the Dies Committee
has made partisan politics out of its hearings and state-
ments—against the Administration. These the Roosevelt
men have denounced. But they have never denounced the
main aims of the Di_es Committee which are the same as
those of Garner and the Republicans. Behind both Roose-
velt and the Dies gang are now the big monopoly interests

 

determined to drive the country into another imperialist
war to save “civilization.”

It seems evident that the Department of Justice, acting
under Roosevelt approval, is trying to supplant the Dies
Committee, by pointing out, in statement and in practice,
that it will do precisely the same job, only more effectively,
and with a different set of partisan politics. Administration
activities against civil liberties are becoming strikingly
similar to those of the Dies-Garner-Republican coalition
that created the un-American Committee.

The Department of Justice, headed by the renowned
“liberal” Frank Murphy-appointed to the Supreme Court,
January 4—has recently undertaken four campaigns, with
the promise of more to come:

1. The Federal prosecution, on outrageous “conspiracy”
charges, of 163 VV.P.A. workers in Minneapolis who face
long years in prison because they opposed the anti-union
provisions of the Woodrum Act (Emergency Relief Appro-
priation Act of 1939) and struck last summer against the
W.P.A. cuts. - C

2. Prosecution of Earl Browder, VVilliam Weiner, Harry
Gannes and possibly other Communist leaders on minor
technical charges of having many years ago violated pass-
port regulations. The fact that the Communist Party leads
the opposition to America's entry or participation in any
form in the present war, and that these cases were never
developed until that situation arose, is particularly sig-
niﬁcant.

These prosecutions tie in also with current agitation "of
the New York Herald Tribune and a number of anti-labor
Democrats and Republicans for complete suppression of
the Communist Party. Similar tactics, we recall, were used
against Eugene V. Debs as well as many other paciﬁsts,
Socialists, and anti-militarist groups who refused to follow
another ex-liberal, Woodrow Wilson, into the last “war
for democracy.” Then as now G—Man J. Edgar Hoover was

' used to club down the people’s opposition to war.

It is clear that the Communists are merely now ﬁrst on
