white workers were to get together we could ﬁght  

for some real democracy here. That is the ﬁght I
am willing to begin. I know who my enemies are.

And when these "same enemies come telling Inc i_
about going .to ﬁght against Hitler, what I tell them_

in my mind is what would be very out of place in a
ﬁreside chat, so you will have to guess at it. b

I know a Negro school teacher who says that
we must ﬁght with Roosevelt to defeat Hitler. I
want to see Hitler defeated but why should I trust
Roosevelt? How do I know that Roosevelt at some
time or other wouldn’t turn traitor? Look at the
King of Belgium. He must have told the poor Bel-
gians to come and ﬁght\ with him for democracy.
Now he has surrendered’ to Hitler and next thing
he will be helping Hitler to impose fascism on
the Belgian people. That is what you get when
you listen to these Kings and Presidents ar1d.Gen-
erals all urging poor people to come and ﬁght
against Hitler. I l1ave been watching that school
teacher a long time. And I think that what he
wants to defend is ’not. democracy but the $35 a
week he gets for tea_ching in the Jim Crow school.
If he wants to die for democracy and his $35, that
is his business. But he isn’t going to lead me into
that. When we have defeated the enemies of

in democracy here, then we can give Hitler a beating.
I would be ready to ﬁght against Hitler then.-_ b

 

   

Unite and Fight!

My friends, Negroes are well known for their
belief in God. And I notice that a good ﬁ%side
chat always has something in it about God and
prayers. But I notice too that Hitler in all his
speeches talks about God and asks for his blessing.
President Wilson, that smooth tongued rascal, was

~ full of God too. But Roosevelt, Hitler and Wil-

son not only pray to God, but see to it that they

, have guns, battleships and planes. So tonight, my

friends, my dear friends, I want to leave out the

_ prayers and tell you plainly what is my policy for

the American people and the Negroes in particular.
It is this. Unite and ﬁght for our democracy here.
What I as a black man want is a steady job. I want
good wages, $30 a week for 30 hours a week. I

want a good relief check when I am out of work. I H

want my black children to go to any school in the
neighborhood. I want a good house and Iwant it
where I choose to have it. I want to travel where
I want, go where I want, eat where I want, join
any union or organization that I want. I want this
for myself, I want it for all my black people, and if
any white man is prepared to join with us to ﬁght
for that, I want itfor him too. And it isn’t Hitler
who is keeping these things from me. It is those

  1 JV] T

 

who are robbing, cheating andinsulting my peo_- »

ple.
My friends, to win those things I am prepared

to ﬁght. I may go to jail in that ﬁght. I may get
shot down by the police but I’ll die contented.
Death is deathand I prefer to die ﬁghting here
for my rights and the rights of my people and
those who will ﬁght with us, than die so that
President Roosevelt and his friends might get the
Dutch ‘East Indies or the British West Indies or

any kind of Indies whatsoever. So, my friends, good a

night. I shall not quote scripture but I shall end
with a piece of personal history. I went to the last
war. I was treated like a dog before I went. I was
treated like a dog while I was there. I was treated
like a_ dog when I returned. Ihave been played
for a sucker before, and I am not going to be
played again.

”Labor with a white skin can-

labor with a black skin is

branded"—Kar| Marx

u= WE MUST Du:

¢-

If we must die—let it not be like hogs

Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,
Making their mock at our accursed lot.

If we must die—oh, let us nobly die,

So that our precious blood may not be shed

In vain; then even the monsters we defy

Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!

 

Oh, Kinsmen! We must meet the common foe;
Though far outnumbered, let us still be brave,
And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!
What though before us lies the open grave?
Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack,
Pressed to the wall, dying, but—ﬁghting back!

By NATIVE SON

MY FRIENDS: ,

In this moment of crisis, it is proper that the
voice of the working man should be heard. The
President governs for all, the priests pray for all,
the soldiers ﬁght for all, (so, at any rate, we are
told) but it is the working man who pays for all.

A In times of peace he pays in labor and in sweat. In
ywar he pays in blood. It is always the working

man and the farmers who are placed in the front
line trenches. The sons of the rich stay behind the
lines and direct. I have been to war and I know.

That is why I claim the privilege of a broad-
cast. I am a black working man, but I am a native
son, as American as any white man in this country.
My people were here as early as the family of
President Roosevelt. We Negroes have labored and
helped to make this countrywhat it is. We have
fought in all its wars, from the War of Indepen-

dence to the ﬁrst World War. In fact Crispus At-—

tucks, a Negro, was the ﬁrst American to die in

 

the American Revolution. So that when the l’resi—

dent talks about preparing America for war I de-
mand my right to be heard. I know how to make
a ﬁreside chat. You are all sitting down listening
to me and I am sitting down talking to you. You
know ‘it, I know it, everybody knows it. But in
order to make you feel that you will be getting the
real inside dope in a conﬁdential manner, I shall
begin by saying: “My friends, let us sit down, you
and I, and talk this thing over together.” That
piece ofbaloney being out of the way, we can now
get down to business. ‘ ' '

Is America in Danger?

The President says that Hitler seems to be win—
ning the European war, and for that reason, this
country is in danger of being invaded. Maybe the
country is really in danger. But from the start this
whole invasion business seemed phoney to me. I
went, to France in the last war, and I saw what it
takes to carry a million men across the Atlantic
and to keep them there. Germany is very near to
England. Yet everybody says that Hitler had to cap-
ture Norway and the Channel ports and get with-
in a few milesof England in order to attempt a
successful invasion. Who is such a fool as to believe

 

 

that Hitler can transport millions of men and all.) A

  

the arms andhsupplies needed to invade this coun-
try, across nearly 3,000 miles of sea? The Yankee
C_lipper takes only 20 passengers at a time. How
many clippers will Hitler need to land a million
men in America? Hitler would have to spend years

‘in preparation before he could invade this coun-

try. Furthermore, the President knows that all this
talk about invasion is just a lot of hooey. My wife
Leonora, who is a Red, told me that the other day
the generals of the army and navy made an official
statement that this country was in no danger of
invasion. And if they know that, and I know it,
the President knows it too.

When I said to some of my friends, poor tremb_-
ling Negroes, that they had many things to worry
about but that invasion was not one of them, they
asked me, “But do you think that the President is
lying? Why should he lie? He "only wants to pro-
tect the people.” My friends, and particularly my
young friends, let me _show you how a President
can lie. I went to hear President Wilson speak in
1916. He said that we must vote for him because
he was the man who had kept us out of war. And
as soon as he had won the elections he carried out

the plan he had had in his pocket, for almost a‘

year before the elections, and we were in the war
before you could wink. Since that time, my friends,

 

I know how Presidents can lie. Wilson wanted.t_o
get us in and he used one jive. Roosevelt wants to
get us in and he is using another one. He wants.
to frighten us with the fear of invasion, although
his own generals and admirals tell us the exact

opposite.

Defend What Democracy?

My friends, why _’does the President want us
to ﬁght? He and all the writers in the papers’ say
that it is to defend our democracy. Our democ-

‘ racy! My friends, when I heard that I laughed for

ten minutes. Yes. Laughed. I’ll tell-‘ you why. It
was because I was so damned mad that if I didn’t
laugh I would have broken the radio. And that
radio cost me $4 in the pawn shop and I didn’t
want to break it. I

Tell me, Mr. President, what democracy do I
defend by going to ﬁght Hitler? Hitler is a vile
criminal and should be driven off the face of the
earth. But I have no democracy and the democracy

 

I haven't got Hitler didn’t take from me, I know _
all those who have been taking away ‘democracy 

from me and my people. They are Cotton Ed

Smith, Senator Bilbo, Vice-President Garner, all 

of them aided by you, President Roosevelt for all

of you are in one Party together, the Democratic ,  

  
    

Party, and if you were any friend of the Negro,
you couldn't be working «so closely in the same
Party with these Negro-hating, Negro-baiting‘ little
American Hitlers from the South. William Green,
president of the American Federation of Labor,
who discriminates against Negroes in his unions is
another. There are thousands of others pl could
name. They have been lynching me and my people,
giving us the dirtiest jobs, at the lowest pay, Jim
(Trowing us, taking the taxes we pay to teach white

p children, treating us worse than they treat their
dogs. They were doing all this before Hitler was

born, they do it now, they will do it long after
Hitler is dead, unless we Negroes ourselves put
a stop to it. I never heard any ﬁreside chat from
you, Mr. President, I never saw, any campaign

A \ carried out by the Senate to give the. American

Negroes democracy, for instance, to pass the anti:
lynching bill or abolish Jim Crow, and the poll tax
which prevents Negroes in the South from voting.
May I tell you Mr. President, politely as suits a
ﬁreside chat, that you and the hypocritical scoun-

drels who rule this country with you, should stop

‘being so active in defense of democracy abroad A"

andpay attention to the crimes against democracy

, ‘at home. Instead, your newspapers spread a lot of
~ .,'l/ifes about no lynchings having taken place dur-

   

ll

ing the past year. As if they don’t know that nowa-
days the Southern lynchers get together in small
bands and murder any Negro whom they want to
get rid of, very quietly so as to keep it out of the

papers.

The Fifth Column

My friends, the President warns us about the
ﬁfth column. I understand that this is the new
name for the enemies of democracy. Where have
the President’s eyes been all this time? If he wants

to ﬁnd out who these ﬁfth column people are, he

just has to ask the Negroes. We know them. We
spend our lives ﬁghting against them. If the Pres=
ident sends a reporter to me, with a large note-
book, I guarantee that between sunrise and sun-
down tomorrow I’ll point out to him more ﬁfth
column enemies of democracy then he can ﬁnd

room for in all the jails of this country. No, Mr. V

President. we'll begin to listen to you about the
ﬁfth column when you begin to put in jail some of
the really big enemies of democracy in this country,
beginning with the United States Vice-President,
Jack Garner, boss of the Jim Crow state of Texas.

My friends, the President and all the papers
say that we must stop aggression. But when Musso-
lini-made his aggression against Ethiopia, you, Mr.

\   
‘ ' - ~. 3:3»
. ,‘ » .’~;i

 

President, prevented us from sending arms to Ethi-

I opia. Where was all your hatred of aggression then?

But,I notice that today you have the American
ﬂeet ready to ﬁght Japan for the Dutch East Indies.
My wife Leonora, who is a Red, tells me that
America wants to ﬁght Germany to prevent Hitler
taking the colonies of the Allied countries, and to
keep Germany as much as possible out of the fat
trade with‘ China and Spanish America. That
makes sense «to me. But what I know is this, that
whatever President Roosevelt wants to ﬁght about,
it is not democracy. I have no interests in the Dutch
East Indies. The ‘natives there got no democracy
frrorn the Dutch. They will get no democracy
from .America. They will get none from Japan.
They will get some democracy only when they

V drive out all these leeches and take charge of their

country themselves.

Democracy Begins at Home

My friends, it is not only the poor Negroes who
get no democracy. The other day I saw a picture,
“The Grapes of Wrath.” In it I saw whites, miser-
able and suffering almost as much as we Negroes
suffer. Every week outside the relief station there
a.re whites standing with me, no better off than I

 am. If these poor Okies and the Negroes and the
