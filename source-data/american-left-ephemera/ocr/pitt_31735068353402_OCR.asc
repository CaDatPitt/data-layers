Local 915 at Ray-Sonora, Ariz.

In addition to the basic wage settlement, a number of local im-
provements werewon from the comany at each property.

A Baxter Springs strike. .

BAXTER SPRINGS, Kans. _..
Membersof Local 514 won their
four-monthstrike against the St.
Louis Smelting & Refining Com-

pany last week. ‘They went back,”
to work on the basis’ of a settle- '

ment which gave them important
gains._  ' V

L I The key issue in_the. strike was I
. thevsliding scale, which tied wages '
in the zinc industry to a price of

$75 a ton for zinc ‘concentrates.
Both- the AFL. and the CIO Gas,
Coke & Chemical Workers have

been helping to preserve this scale

by refusing to take on other com-
panies in the Tri-State area in a.
majorefight againstpitx '

While" the strike settlement
did not abolish the sliding scale
saltogether, itlsucceeded in raising

thefloor to $90 a ton. This places _
A the floor $2-5 above any other in. I
"the Tri-State’ area. ' All others can '

drop to $65, which could cut

workers’ wages $2.50 lower than ’

those of Local 511.

In addition,’ Local 514 won a.

wage’ increase of 25 centswa day,’

A i the union shop, and three days ,off_
with pay in case -of a death in the 0
family.’ Thepnew contract also '

provides - for improved seniority",

including a bidding system which —
gives _ preference to the older!
workers, two week s’ vacation-

after three years’ service and
three weeks after fifteen years.‘

The workers approved the
settlement with an overwhelming
majority, and have returned to
work.

The /‘strike was marked by» a
raid against the union by the C10
Gas, Coke & Chemical Workers.
The strikers voted in October 83

to 23 to remainin Mine-Mill in an e
V NLRB election which not onl_v‘dee-'

feated the raiders but provedto

‘thecompany that the strike was 
solid. 5. I   

 

ATLANTIC V CITY——Walter Reuther,
head of the United Auto Workers, was
elected president of the C10 in con-
ivention balloting, which followed a
period of intensive lobbying between
forces backing Reuther and those
backing Allan Haywood. ,

V Haywood was elected to the post
of executive vice president, which the
convention gave officialistatus. James
Carey, who also heads the Int’l Union
or Electrical Radio & Machine Work-
V ers, was re—elected CIO secretary.
Reuther was supported ‘by his own

union delegates, as well as Amalga-

mated Clothing Workers, IUE, Na-
tional Maritime Union, Retail and
Wholesale Union, Textile Workers Un-

ion, Transport Service Employes Un-J
ion, rubber, oil, American Radio Asso-

ciation and Brewery Workers.

In addition to the Steelworkers, Hay-
wood got the votes of the Coinmunica-
tions, Packinghouse, Woodworkers,
Shipyard, and Transport Workers
"unions, and 16 smaller unions. The roll
call showed 3,079,181 for Reuther, and
2,613,103 for Haywood. The votes,
based on claimed membership figures,
showed that"the actual CIO member-

shipiof about 3,400,000 had been blown,

up to 5,680,000. , ,-

ALMOST ALL of the delegates were
full-time employees of the affiliated
unions and councils. _ A

While Reuther won the presidency,
Haywood retained-control of the or-

ganization apparatus, and his office,

was mad_e a part of the constitutional
structure so that hecannot be removed
by Reuther. This will give both Reu-
. ther and Haywood a leverage for con-
tinuation of their factional struggle.
Bitterness of the fight between’ Reu-
ther and Haywood was reflected in
comments by C10 Steel union leaders
at Pittsburgh after the convention,
that from now on they are going to
devote their time to their'own union.

The steel union is big enough to exist '

without CIO, they said, but CIO needs
them; “We could save ourselves $2%
‘milliona year in per capita tax by af-
filiating with the AFL,” one said.

The division is not based on~issues.
Many goodresolutions were adopted,
but without discussion. Others were not
even brought to the floor, but referred
to the executive board and adopted
there without debate.

THE CONVENTION adopted a reso-
lution demanding an end to the wage
freeze and creation of “standby con-
trols to be pu_t"into effectwhenever
inflationary controls so require.” At
the same time the resolution urged
continuation of rent control. ’

While t-héconvention adopted.-a reso-

 lution. pledging “devotion to the ideal
of organic unity in the American labor
movement,” President Emil Rieve--of
the Textile Workers “warned” against
what he called a “Munich Pact.” The
C10 Textile Workers are engaged in
9. bitter dispute with their AFL rival.

During discussion of the civil rights
resolution," Director John Riffe of the
Southern Organizing Committee de-

-clared that a strong fight against dis-
‘ erimination was essential to the suc-

cess of ClO’s organizing _-efforts in,

. the south. ‘V“I know, that some of our
V local union people and union represen-

 you’re running away, son, remember
,5". . don't take any lousy non-union jobs."

said. “They back away from it.”

A CIVIL liberties resolution called
“to review and‘ revise
existing security laws, such Vas the

sive activities control act, so that the

[security of the nation shall be safe-

guarded against acts ofsabotage and
espionage ‘without subjecting indi-
viduals. to persecution on the basis
of speech and advocacy alone.”

A resolution criticized the -McCar-
ran—Walter act, which goes into effect
December 24, for adding new restric-
tions to immigration, providing “an
offensive new concept of racial origin”
and discriminating against Negroes.
It is said the act “makes second-class

on various grounds such as contempt
of Congress.” , ' '

analysis . of the Presidential election
results, declared that the “war in

“was a personal one in. every sense of

THE CONVENTION heard sharp
criticism from Thurgood -Marshall”
special counsel-for the National Asso-
ciation for Advancement of Qolored
People, who said: “In many instances

1 you have transformed these resolutions

(against discrimination) into a living
reality, but often,’ and, in some cases
toooften, there. is a disparity between
the resolutions, between the formal
statements of policy, and the everyday
reality.”

National (310 convention at Atlantic‘City:f '  ‘ 1 7  

Wage Freeze
“There' is no justificdtion for main-

‘ taining wage stabilization under‘ cur-

rent. co,nditions.§” The 1'esolution,
demanded that wage controls be ended,
and that inflation controls,,Vbe put on
a “standby basis.” ‘_ -l

Taxes

Urging continuationof excess profits
and capital gains taxes, due to expire
early in 1953, the convention warned:-
“The pressures from the reactionary
elements in Congifess‘will be tocnact
a sales tax as an alternative method of
raising./revenue. A sales tax bears most
heavily on those least able to’ pay.” _

_ Rent Colrl-rolond Housing

 “Eoctendiland strengthen rent control
throughout the U.S.” andexpand home

Labor Unity

the Americanlabor mov'einent.”‘ Added
that “we in the" CIO have recognized

the countless impwrtanit organization

Eisenhower's Victory

“A -reasonable estimate of C10 mem-
bers who agreed with. the Vpolitical
recommendations of their leadership is

. 70% to 75%.” But, as the Gallup poll

indicated, “while ,a, majority‘ of the
people of the country approved .U.S.=
action in Korea at the time it was
taken, dmajo/rity of the ‘people now
believe the action was unwise. The war
in Korea‘ was . . .. 'most,frequently
mentioned as a deciding factor.’’'

9 illlttorney explains yneed
for Fifth‘Ame1gdmenti

\ The charge thata witness who refuses to answer a Mc-
Carran committee question is automatically guilty,‘is a “nullifi-
cation’_' of the Fifth‘ Amendment, according, to Harold H.

‘Corbin, one of the most distinguished conservative lawyers in
"America.

In alengthy letter to the New York.La,w; Journal, ‘Corbin
points out, not only “that innocent persons may refuse to an- 0

swer,” but that “it. was for their protection that the privilege”
of the Fifth_Amendme_nt “was designedj’ ’ C l

The idea that anyone who refuses to answer is therefore

guilty is “false and dangerous doctrine,” Corbin says, “for

many reasons: " V

_ “1. It makes -a mockery of a great protective right by turn-
ing its protection against selﬂincrimindtion into an act of self-

incrimindtion. What good is the right if to exercise it is as de- -

structive as to waive it? -

“2. ‘It assumes that the right itself was enacted for the

protection of the guilty, which absurdly makes knaves or fools
of our forefathers. who conceived andtprescrvled it. Our elders
knew, as we know, that this protection to the innocent may also
operate at times as oi shelter to the, guilty; but its value has
long since -been appraised and foundpssential as a safeguard
against hccdlcss,’ unfounded or tyrannical prosecutions.

“3. ‘ltassumcsvthdt an innocent man cannot honestly claim
that his answers might tend. to incriminate‘ him, whereas long
and bitter experience has taught just the contrary. a - '

“4. It assumes that the over-zealous prosecutor and ‘public
clamor forpunishment are things of the past, whereas we have
only to lookat recent prosecutions and the opinions of our own

appelateo courts to know that they are with us always. Am- _ '
bitious, though well-intcntioned, prosecutors feed and grow on ‘

successfulprosecutions, both professionally’ and politically, as

' much as ever. Their normal temptations to strain for convic-

/

tions are" multiplied when popular feeling runshighand the V

public cries for prosecution and punishment.

’ “5. It ignores the fact that our highest courts have re-

peatedly dnnounced the fallacy of the doctrine pronounced .ycs- ‘

terday by the eminent members of the'United Nations Panel.”

Turning to history, Corbin points" to the fact that “the
origin and reason for the constitutional privilege . .. . was to
protect innocent, men against the inquisitorial andmanifestly
unjust methods ofinterrogating witnesses, the temptation of
prosecutors to press, browbeat and entrdp them into fatal con-

vtrddictions, and-against‘ the zeal of the prosecutor and public

clamor for the punishment of crime. «

“These tendencies were painfully evident in the earlier-

state trials prior to the expulsion of the Stuarts from the Brit-
ish‘ throne in 1688. They made the English system of criminal
prosecution‘ so odious that it was abolished and replaced in part
by this rule against sclf-incrimin'ation. ‘

“And, when our Union was formed, the American obl-

‘  onists, still conscious of the iniquitiesktnd oppressive features

of "the prior practice, carried the ruleinto the fundamental law

‘ of all théstatcs and clothed it withlthe impregnability of a con-

stitutional amendment.” I —‘

    
‘How Chicago local; «

lights Jim Crow  

CHICAGO—Theimer9nbers of Mine- ,-
Mill’s big Local 758'here have learned

that the fight against Jim Crow must
be pushed on a day-to-day basis, both
inside and outside the shops.

The local has some 2,000 members in
about 20 shops. It has now won anti-

 

discrimination clauses in all its con-' 

tracts. In all plants but one, Negro
and white workers labor side by side.

Just two’ months ago, Local 758 won
the ‘employment of Negro women in
one plant——Molded Products-éwhere no‘
Negro women had worked before. In
another plant, Stewart Die, the local

fought for and won the. up-grading 01 --

three Negro workers from_ truckers to
finishing department, increasing their

wages about $20 a week. The up-grad-’

ing: was based on a'job—posting system
established by the union contract.

RECENTLY, the Local acted on at
proposal of the Mine-‘Mill ‘convention in
New York to elect an FEPC commit-.‘

tee. Within the local, of course, Negro
and white workers have equal rights,

and Negro members are numbered 

. among the stewards, plant chairmen

and officers of the local, includingtha
Local 758 president, Robert Bey.

"Some 30wmembers of the local “tooli-

part’ in picketing Woolworth’s and
Scott’s five-and-dime stores recently,
to. protest their discrimination in em.-

ployment. The picket lines paid,off.j_
Both stores have taken down the Jim,-

Crow bars.

T-he local’s members also played an
active part in the fight to free Harold
Ward from a framed—up murder charge;
which grew out of the International
Harvester strike this fall. Ward, a
prominent leader of the Earm Equip-
ment Workers department of‘ UE, was
acquittedby a jury on the first ballot.

BUT IN SPITE of its long list 01

victories, members of Local 758 know‘
the. job is far from done. ‘Biggest im-.

mediate target of its FEPC committee

isthe winning of a consistent program .

for jobs and up-grading of Negroes ‘in

all Mine-Mill shops in the ‘area. And-

at the same time, the committee saysxi

“We want to have a better tie-up with "

the Negro Labor Council in our ‘area.
We have to lend more‘ help to the fight
for housing, schools- and other living

necessities for Negro workers in China I

cago.” o

FIGHT FOR‘. JOBS for Negroes in Wool-
worlh's- and Scoll’s five-and-dime stores.
Members of Mine-Mill local 758 ioined
with workers from other unions in picket-
ing dime stores in Chicago. The campaign
was successful.

 Tout le mouvement ouvrier était en~

une campagne destinée a mettre les»
unions au courant du danger. Dans

' l’es'prito de millions d’ouvriers et d’hon-

synonyme de loi anti-ouvriere et anti- -

_ le Bill H-8 n’eXiste plus. Cependant,

seul le nom a été changé. Ce projet de

Bill 0 soit p_résenté a la Chambre avant

et un
comité parlementaire est charge -de
l’étudier et de présenter ses recom-
mandations au' sujet--de ce Bill.

‘ Une premiere tentative de camou-
flage a été faite des le début. En fait,
le Bill H-8, alias Bi1l‘0, est une série
d‘amendements au code criminel.‘ C’est

un document d’environ 400 pages com- -

prenant - quelque, 750 clauses. Les
législateurs, a Ottawa, se disaient sans
dou-te que personnene lirait ce docu-
ment et que tous les amendements

-séraient ,votés un beau jour, "sans que"

Parmi tous‘ ces amendements, :l_e

clauses concernentsurtout la protection

A CE PROPOS, un mineur disait:
“Si ,un homme se' prétend mon ami ct

pourquoi voter une loi anti-ouvriere,

Clark visits  Bisbee-Douglas 

'DOUGLAS, Ariz.‘— The McCarran
‘committee “investigation” ‘of Mine-Mill

‘ is just-one part of a big -scale attack

on the whole labor movement, Int’l
President John Clark warned‘ the mem-

bers of Southern Arizona Smeltermen's ‘
at a meeting here

November 26.. _ . ,. .i
-President Clark‘ showed the parallel-

between the heavyimany-sided attacks. -
on the entire labor moyement in the'~
early 1920's, and the current campaign ‘

spearheaded. by reactionary congress-
men on behalf of the National Associ-
'ation of Manufacturersiiand the U. S.
Chamber of Commerce. ‘
This attack, he said, is featured not
only by congressional “investigations”
aimed at smearing unions and their

leadership, but by the introduction of-

new, vicious anti-labor legislation.

The meeting at which President I

Clark was guest speaker was well
attended. Chairman was Local 470

history. These were the workers who
were largely responsible for starting
the fight, tomake Canada a better
place for workers to live in. Out of
their early struggles were born the
8-hour day, workmen’s ‘compensation

Quotes from NegroVLah0r Council speeclieisl

Maurice E‘. Travis, Mine-Mill Int’l Secretary-Treasurer, wasptho,

, The keynote speech at the recent National Negro Labor Council
convention in Cleveland was delivered by NNLC President William R.
Hood, who is recording secretary of “the biggest local in the world,”
Local 600, UAW-C10. H ere are some experts from H ood’s important

I , address:

WE did not organize the National Ne-
gro Labor Council to beg crumbs from
the man’s,table. We did not organize to.

beg permission. We fight to bring the 'V

walls of Jim Crow down. We stand
A united to bring the sun down on every
last vestige of white supremacy in_our
country. We fightfor the rise of a new

-day—the day of the brotherhood and v

sisterhood of all men and women.

"We declare . _. . that no official of
any union, nor any power. onearth,
will keep us apart from the millions
of white workers in mine, mill and
factor)’ with whom we share the com-
mon burdenof a brutal and unlicensed
exploitation. ‘ C V

The National Negro Labor Council
was founded, and exists today, to-help
,further~ unite, not separate, all sons
and daughters of labor, whatever their
race, creed, color or national origin.

THE NATIONAL Negro Labor Coun-
cil was founded, and exists today, to
help strengthen, not, weaken, the great

‘ union organizations of this land, and
.to contribute to their historic fight for
the rights of workers on the basis of
an all-out battle against discrimination
in industry, in the labor movement and
in every nook and cranny of American
lire.

The keepers ofV Jim Crow and the V

enemies of Negro unity called again
Von their old servant, Uncle Tom, to
slow down our fight for freedom. But

that didn’t work, because everybody S

knows that Old Uncle is so far gone
he can’t live for dying. .-
And so they called ‘on another de-
crepit character—-Mr. W,orn-Out-Red-
Baiter. But no one or nothing could

stop, the Freedom Train. It was as if .-

Langston Hughes,‘ that great poet of

the Negro people, had told his char-
acter “Simple” to blow a vast s_axa-
phone throughout the land, blurting out

the tune; “Good morning, Daddy, ain’t

you heard the boggie—woggie rumble of

a dream deferred?” And it was as’ if

V millions of voices answered back: “The
 dream will not be deferred. The walls

of Jim Crow will come tumbling V

down.”

This startling, fact-that non-whites
have been economically worse off since
1944——is complete refutation of those
who argue that
brought a lessening of economic and
other forms of discrimination against
the Negro people and minority groups.

THE PROPORTION of jobs held by

V Negro men has decreased sharply since
1944. They hold fewer jobs today, in
proportion, than they did 12 years ago.
"This conclusion isn’t‘ours alone. It is
based on U. S. Census Bureau figures.

All this means that the average in-
come of -Negro‘ families has. been
sliarplyreduced in relation to the in’-

come xof white families in the past"

decade. . ' _ .
And those who keep on talking about
the great ‘»‘economic progress” ofthe
, Negro should bear in mind that even
 in a period including the years‘ of

\

“time” alone has '

“ greatest World War II gains,‘ 19.39 to‘

1949, the_reduction of income differ-
V ence between ‘whiteand Negro work-
! ers amounted to 6.5 per cent. At this
rate of “gradual progress” the Negro
people would achieve income equality
 in 74 years, or‘ by theyear 2036. WE
, CANNOT AND WILL NOT WAIT

THAT LONG. ' .

I In its final report‘ the war-time
President’s Committee on Fair -Em-
ployment -Practices issued a grim
warning. It said that: “The war-time
gains of Negro, Mexican-American and
Jewish workers are being dissipated
through an unchecked revival of dis-
criminatory practices.” That warning
has gone unheeded. .

NOW SOME FOLKS think that the
current war production- program has
resulted in the removal of barriers
against employment of Negro workers
in industry. The. National Urban
League, as a result of surveys made
in 30 industrial cities this year, con-

, eludes that: “Unless drastic steps are
taken to curtail ‘discriminatory employ-
tnent practices in the majority of -the

  Dec. V15. 1952 

 

nation's industry’s having defense con-

tracts, there will be very few Negro
workers in the manpower mobilization

‘ program. —

The economic‘ treatment of Negro
women is one ofthe nation’s major
scandals. Negro women have to work
at the most menial jobs, at the lowest
pay to. supplement theincome of the

family. . . . two years ago, at the turn’

of the second half of the Twentieth
Century, all Negro women workers in
the United States, so-called champion
of world democracy, averaged a measly
NINE DOLLARS AND SEVEN CENTS
A WEEK. A

In 3nYb0dY’s language this is not
progress of even a gradual nature. It

"is retrogression, swift and terrible;

MAKE NO MISTAKE about it, un-

V less democratic hiring and other,demo-

cratic rights are fought for around
these new 'indu‘stVries  the South,
these huge iiidustries springing up
cannot be organized by. the labor
movemen except on the basis of the
Southern pay differential and weak or
Company unions. ’ ..

Yes, in Asia, Africa, the Middle East,
Puerto Rico, ‘the cry is the same-—END
WHITE SUPREMACY RULE.-

We can do no less than extend greet-
ings to these brave people and at the
same. time take heart in our fight at
home. H " ‘

As we march confidently down the

path ahead, we can feelassured that

the day is ours, for unity, peaceiand
democracy for all. -

To the 15 million Negro people we

say: We have pooled the great strength .

of your black working sons and ‘daugh-
ters from the mines, mills, factories
and farms. Many of the good things of
our land will be ours.

We urge all our people to build upon

the rock of pooled strength as we seek '

tobuild together a Freedom House to
which all may retire in" equality and
dlgnlty when driven by the harsh
winds of Jim Crow. This house will
stand when the winds of adversity and
the hurricane of struggle beset it.
We, the working millions, made up
of the greatest buying power of our
people, which all told is greater than
that of Canada. We represent the Ne-
gro people"s greatest ‘striking power.
Morethan that, our allies among the
white democratic 'wo_rkersV of the land
are ,iI1C1‘ea.Si11gV by leaps and bounds. _
_WE CALL UPON Negro workers -ev-
erywhere,’ regardless of their -union
affiliation or lack of union affiliation,
to_join with us in our brave fight to
bring the walls of Jim Crow tumbling
down. _ ,
We call on the American trade lun-
ions to unite .with us in this fight to

protect the unions, our living standards .

and our country’s democracy, for ev-
ery worker's‘ cause will be advanced
when the walls of Jim Crow come
tumbling down and black ‘and white

.workers are not sepafated "by artifi-

cial barriers of white supremacy.

’ V Anyone. not an

only white trade unionist invited to address’ the recent NNLC conven-‘,V
tion. Travis is a member of the NNLC national--board. Here are some

quotes from his address:.

THIS organization is serving to bring
home to the country a growing aware-
ness of the danger to ALL peoples that
flows from the special oppression and
exploitation of the Negro people. . . .
Ifhis is a job udnch, before our tnne,
the Abolitionists did so well; and where
they succeeded, we also shall succeed,
"for in our day the signs of the peoples’
victory are written plainly on all walls.
We, too, the white workers of this
land, must recognize that when we hear
or see words and action designed to
hold down our Negro brothers and
sisters, that these are no more than
special ‘means -of defeating all of us.

While we express satisfaction-.overV

the progress mbfde by the National
Negro Labor Council during the past
year, we must unfortunately say that

the organized labor movement as a '

whole has not’ -made progress in the
fight for Negro rights and representa-
\ tion in industry and unions. I
ONLY LAST MONTH, the liberal
St. Louis Post—Dispatch published a.

survey indicating a steady decline‘ in;

Negro representation in‘ the top leader-
'ship of the AFL and its affiliated
unions-;, while in the railroad industry

most of the brotherhoods still contain" ,

shameful white supremacy provisions
in their constitutions. barring Negroes

from membership. , A v

Now, while by contrast, progressive
tradeunionists have done better, their
limited movement cannot be of great
comfort. It must be recorded that since
the lgst Convention the white progres-
sive trade unionists have not. suffi-

ciently kept step with the needseof the -

times and paralleled the growing
militancy and maturity of the Negro
unionists. ~

* The progressive white trade unionists,

have not yet developed adequate action
in organizing and concentrating among

. white workers on,th’e issue of‘ Negro-

white unity. They have not consistently
participated in the daily planning and
activity of the National ‘Negro Labor
Councily. In the interest of accuracy I
must include myself and my own union
in this conclusion. A — A

‘ IT SEEMS TO ME, especially in the.

Deep ‘South that ‘what our Negro
brothers need is more vigo‘rous.action'

by white leaders and active rank. and-~
filers. It is a great .thrill "to a Negro.

workersto know he ‘doesn’t havefto
fight a‘ white worker before he can
fight the boss who is fighting‘ both.

Yes, the front line‘ in the fight.

against Jim Crow and -in the struggle
for ‘Negro-white unity. is in the Deep
South. It is there that the most ugly
and vicious forms of encroachment on
the Bill of Rights and anti-labor _re-
actionary expressions are ' manifest.

Every worker know s. and every VV

Union recognizes that what gains ‘it is
possible to make in other areas of the
" country are in jeopardy so long as

These people have a long history of . 
suffering and evploitation at the hands V 
of the mining,_ agriculturaland trans-
portation industries. They have, o.vVeVr,.a. V ‘

 

these varied interests. V _ V
In order to perpetuate them_V_in this i  7
status, reaction has left no stone un- 
turned, robbing them of their wealth, 
their land, and its natural resources- 5
They have deprived the Mexicanpeople  V
of their economic and political rights, .V
andeven more, they have attempted to.  
wipe out their historic) cultural herit-
age. _ ’ .  V.1V~.'.
THE MEXICAN -PEOPLE have not , 
taken.__all this lying down. Like all fl 
oppressed» peoples through the years; V, p
the Mexican people have fought‘ back»  ‘V
in every way they knew how. They ‘
have been among the staunchest and. 
most consistent fighters for freedom 
and democracy in the Southwest. VV _
In my. own union we have ,had_ the  ‘-
fortunate opportunity of witness?ingf_  WV
glimpses of thevpotential strength for V C’
the‘labor movement that unity with the
Mexican workers means. There is no
question about it, the labor‘ movement  A
in the West and throughout the cou.nti;yV; V; H
can never realize its ful_lj_strength until‘ 
these and all other Mexican workers » 
are organized. V i »  V
THE PACE of the attackhas been ,, A
stepped up. The hysterical atmosphere J V
created by attacks on “political-"*an_dV

This advance. of reaction can be‘ V

ATLANTA—Dijo el concejo especial
Thurgood Marshall de la Asociaciori
Nacional para el Progreso del Pueblo
Negro, que el Congreso‘ de_ Organiza-
ciones Industriales (CIO) y el resto ’
del movimiento obrero organizado
tienen la responsabilidad de ponerle el ~
fin a “la tradicion vil de condenar -
al trabajador Negro para que haga cl
trabajo mas duro, mas sucio y mas mal
pagado.” - 1

Marshall le dijo a la 14 convencion
nacional del CIO aqui que: “Través el
pais, eneste momento,-hay demasiados / '-
Negros educados barriendo suelos o
manejando elevadores, hay demasiadas
mujeres Negras limpiando escusados y
vale mas que Udscle pongan fin a esto.”

Marshall dijo que esto era muy im-
portante, particularmente en el su_r.
“Relatlvo a casos y asuntos que tocair
diractamente sobre las ‘establecidas lift-
eas de color en las regiones industriales,
el perjuicio racial es, demasiad"as veces,
el factor dominante. El movimientoob-‘
rero debe eliminar la distincionque
existe de lo dicho contra la segregacion
en el sur, a lo hecho ya que muchasf
