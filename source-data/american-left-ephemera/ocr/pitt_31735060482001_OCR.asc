The gang has delayed matters as long as it dare. ‘The 0tis—Burns
thugs are desperate. Read Shoaf’s telegram of July 14 on other side of
this letter.i They fear "Debs" and "the Socialists"-for the publicity
they have given--and what they know is coming. ’ ‘

V August 51 is the sixteenth anniversary of the little old Appeal.
September 4 is Labor Day. Exactly between the two comes the Rescue
Edition. And the masters set the date! No. 822 will combine three work-
ing class interests--Rescue Edition, Labor Day issue and Anniversary
number. The plutes haye played into our hands.

I am sending this letter to every member of the Army. If you have
already ordered and paid for a bundle of the Rescue Edition, pass this
letter to someone else. If you previously ordered, to remit when issue
"was announced, fill out_enclosed blank and mark "previously ordered."
If you haven't ordered at all, now is the time to join your comrades and
unmask capita1ism,with five million copies of this issue. As soon as
you have done your part, take the matter up with your local, with your
union, anywhere and everywhere that labor isorganized or awake. Papers
will be in your hands to distribute on Labor Day. YOU are needed. No one
can be spared. If you took part in the Moyer-Haywood victory you will
Jump at this chance oférepeating the dose. If You didn't take Part in
that, learn how it feels to fight and CONQUER.

Your answer to-this letter is the supreme test of the Appeal Army
as a militant organizatﬂbn. Use Rescue Edition blank 9n°1°59d-

Yours for victory,

A 00NSP|R_A_§_Y EVIDENT!

I-llgh-Handed Proceedings at Los Angeles—ProsecutIon

Hurls Defiance

ax GEORGE H. snciu‘.
Sta! Correspondent to the APPEAL.

By Telegraph to the APPEAL.

Los Angeles, Cal., July 14.-—Judge
Walter Bordwell today decided that
John J. and James B. McNamara shall
go to trial October 10th.

The prosecuting attorneys and
Burns’ detectives laughed at the dis-
comﬁture of the attorneys for the
defense who tried to make the best
of the situation.

Monday morning Mrs. Ortie Mc-
Manigal will appear before Judge
Bordwell and will probably be sent
to jail for contempt of court. This
is what the ‘prosecution wants if she
cannot be induced to corroborate in

part her husband’s alleged confession.-

Burns’ detectives say the case
against the McNamara brothers will
be complete. Unbiased spectators in
Bo:-dwell’s court the last ten days
declare they never saw a case of any
kind handled more one-sidedly than
the I.l"cNamara case. In the Moyer,
Haywood case Judge Wood in a
measure preserved a neutral attitude
toward the case. Judge Bordwell
openly and boldly is with the prose-
cution; in many of his rulings he has
been positively brutal. Bordwell not
only represents the judicial end of the
Merchants’ and Manufacturers’ asso-
ciation, but he also is friend and ad-
mired of Harrison Gray Otis, owner
of the Times. He prides himself on
being on terms of intimacy with Eng-
lish snobocracy which abounds in
southern California and traces his
lineage back to that class of ﬁghters
who with joy would drink the blood
of a bond man while It was yet warm.

Above all things, Bordwell hates
the Irish. He hates the Irish even
more than he despises a workingman.
In the McNamara case this Irish hat-
ing, labor despising, Otis loving
judge, who thinks one English aris-
tocrat is worth more than a whole
state full of American people, has
found the day of his opportunity.
Those who know Borfmvell best say
he will make most of it. Attorneys
for the defense are growing alarmed
at the seriousness of the situation.

at the Workers

Not that their clients are guilty or
that the prosecution has evidence
wherewith to convict, they say, but
the fact that the court and district at-
torney control absolutely and are able
to, and actually do, execute their will
regardless of law, justice or common
humanity.

The attorneys for the defense de-
clare their dependence on the great
body of the people and assert that if
the people would organize in protest
the high-handed practice of the pros-
ecution would stop. Judge Bordwell,
however, says his court cannot be
intimidated by the rabble, though they
storm it with verbal protests twenty
million strong- District Attorney
Fredericks says that while labor pro-
tests may have aifected the prosecu-
tion in the Moyer, Haywood trial
such protest will avail nothing in this
case.

Burns’ detectives boast that some-
thing more powerful than Debs edi-
torials and socialistic wind-jamming
will be necessary to prevent the hang-
ing of John J. and James B. Mc-
Namara.

In short, the prosecution in the
case, aware that back of them is the
full strength of the city, state and
national governments, beside a plu-
tocracy organized and solidiﬁed, and
that in front of them are merely the
people, unorganized and all at sea,
have deliberately decided to apply
iron heel methods.

An attache of the district attor-
ney’s oﬁice today said that it was the
conscious understanding among the
agents of the prosecution that the
McNamara brothers shall be tried and
hung and that if Sam Gompers and
Eugene Debs wanted to unite their
respective followings in a plan to start
something in this country with the
McNamara case as the issue they
could start it and be damned.

This describes the situation in the
McNamara case as it exists in Los
Angeles this week.

With the assistance of several de-
fense detectives the Appea1’s corre-
spondent is continuing his work, clos-
ing in on the man whom Otis hired
to destroy the Times building. It in-
volves daily collisions with Burns’ de-
tectives who seem determined that
nothin shall be done that will inter-
fere mth the plans of the prosecu-
tion.
