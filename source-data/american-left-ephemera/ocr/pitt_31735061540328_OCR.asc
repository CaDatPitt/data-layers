I. THE NEGRO REVOLTS

NEGRO STUDENTS throughout the South began their sit-in movement in
February of 1960. Their immediate challenge was directed against
segregated lunch-counters. But they left no doubt that their aim was
the abolition of the entire Jim Crow system.

These demonstrations, so compelling in their directness and courage,
produced a wave of sympathy in the North. College students, most
of them part of the “apathetic” generation of the Fifties, suddenly
began to act. They picketed, raised money, sent wires of sympathy,
and organized boycotts against Northern stores of the national chains
which discriminated in the South. From New York to Los Angeles,
branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People and of the Congress of Racial Equality took to the streets in
order to make their support clear and effective. In numerous cities
trade unionists joined the picket lines and gave organized support.

Below the Surface

ALL or THIS was quite dramatic. Yet, if the momentous events of the
spring of 1960 are viewed simply on the surface, the broad movement
for civil rights will have lost enormously. The Southern Negro stu-
dents were engaged in a profound social act. For one thing, they were
building a mass movement based on non-violent action and centered
upon the Negro church. For another, their action had tremendous
implications for every institution in American society—above all, for
a political party system that has managed to blur over the issue of
civil rights for decades.

This pamphlet is an attempt to probe this movement of 1960, to get
beneath the dramatic surface, to reach the most basic implications of
this new stage of the struggle for civil rights. It seeks to describe the
past and present carefully with a view toward a better understanding
of how we must act in the future. First of all, this means under-
standing the signiﬁcance of non-violent mass action in the South in
social and political terms and not merely in moral or religious ones.
Then, it requires placingthe current events in the context of a social
analysis of the system of Jim Crow itself. Only when these jobs are
done can we arrive at a clear perspective for the civil rights movement
of tomorrow.

"Massive Resisfance"

AS 1960 began, the movement for liberation of Negroes in the South,
which had been highlighted by the struggles in Montgomery and
Little Rock, was in the doldrums. Instead of massive initiative being

9

 

 

 

developed by the Negro people, their organization and their leaders,
it was Southern racism which organized “massive resistance.”

The resistance to integration of the public schools and the estab-
lishment of the rights of Negroes to the vote has, of course, not been
free fromoutright violence on the part of extremists and brutality
on the part of the police. In the main, however, it has not taken the
form of naked and unabashed violence, as in an earlier period it
might have done. For various reasons white people and their agencies
of government cannot operate in the United States in exactly the same
way as in South Africa. Moreover, it would not have been easy to
resort to naked violence against a movement which had as its symbol
Martin Luther King, Jr., an exponent and practitioner of the Gan-
dhian philosophy and tactic of non-violent direct action.

Southern pro-segregation reaction has mainly taken two forms. In
the ﬁrst place, there are the various ways in which legislative and
judicial machinery is used to thwart the 1954 Supreme Court decision
on school desegregation. Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia, one of the
architects of this policy, is said to have boasted that the Dixiecrats
would tie up the movement for liberation in “a century of legislation
and litigation.” They certainly did slow it down to not much more
than a crawl, as the pattern of “token integration,” which is a denial
of integration, was established where simple refusal to do anything
did not suﬂice.

The second form of reaction against basic change in the structure
of Southern society was cultural or spiritual, but this is not to say
that it does not have massive political consequences. The weight of
Southern thinking, sentiment, emotional response, has remained on
the side of segregation, i.e., of inequality, of white supremacy. So-
called progressive or liberal opinion, at least in so far as it achieves
organized expression, is for segregation, but against closing the public
schools and therefore is for token integration. It is against mob vio-
lence; against crude deﬁance but not against subtle deﬁance of the
1954 Supreme Court decision, and so on. But this is equivalent to
saying that the basic human and political issue of equality, whether
we are indeed a “new nation . . . dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal,” has been decided in the negative by the
majority of white Southerners, whether consciously and deliberately
or passively and by default. This is “massive resistance” to the United
States Constitution.

Negaﬁve Factors

THERE ARE certain other factors which have contributed to the slowing
down of the Negro movement, some of which will be more fully dis-
cussed later on:

There is no political democracy in the South, even to the extent that

10

 

 

this obtains in other sections of the country. It is dominated by a
one—party political regime which distorts, if it does not absolutely
frustrate, anything like popular discussion of issues.

Negroes have virtually no share in the control of law enforcement
machinery.

The economic status of the Negro is inferior. This holds true of all
but a small minority of individual Negroes. Equally important is
the fact that Negro ﬁnance, business and industrial institutions
are relatively weak and have to operate in an economy controlled
by whites.

The labor movement in the South is woefully weak. American labor
as a whole has failed in the recent past really to involve itself in
the struggle for Negro equality. It has still not undertaken the
long-promised campaign to organize the South while at the same
time Jim Crow practices remain in some of the important AFL-CIO
aﬂiliates.

Ballad Ouf
IN THE MIDST of all these conditions the liberation movement was
badly bogged down before the sit-ins broke out. The leadership did
not provide a strong program and clear initiative. During the dis-
graceful ﬁlibuster over the civil rights bill in the Senate, not a single
move was made by any of the organizations to launch a stern and
dramatic protest. Then the student sit-ins in one Southern city after
another “bailed them out,” if we may use that expression to state a
sociological fact, not to cast slurs at individual leaders. These sit-ins
were essentially spontaneous. They occurred, of course, in the context
of the struggles, -frustrations and disappointments to which we have
referred. Neither Communists-—whatever Harry Truman may believe
—nor anybody else from “the North” thought up and organized the
sit-in demonstrations. Certainly, the current remnant of the American
Communist movement is hardly capable of affecting any real political
developments in the U.S. In the civil rights ﬁeld in particular it can
no longer play any role because it has long been recognized as a
group which has never hesitated to suspend its “devotion” to civil
rights whenever the demands of Soviet Communism demanded this.
Two types of Southerners have put forward this myth of “outside
agitation” and of Communist tactics. On the one hand, there are
those racists who know that these allegations are false and simply
use them for their own purposes. Such people are, to put it kindly,
political scoundrels. On the other hand, there are those Southerners
who honestly believethese tales. They are themselves the white victims
of segregation. They have been so mis-educated by the caste system
which they uphold as to become blind to a social reality. They liter-
ally cannot understand that the best educated, the most disciplined

ll

 

 

and cultured—and essentially middle class—Negro students are fed up
with racial discrimination. That fact, and not som.e “outside agita-
tion,” was the dynamic element in the sit-in movement. As Martin
Luther King has said, oppressed people do not need Mr. Khrushchev
or anyone else to tell them to revolt.

But it is even more important in a sense that the sit-ins were
“spontaneous” in that no organization such as the NAACP, CORE
or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference thought them up
and organized them. For the time being it is the students who have
given a lift to the established civil rights organizations rather than
the other way around. The sit-ins have conferred a fresh importance
on such men as Roy Wilkins and Martin Luther King.

Within a few days each of these men recently issued a call to action.
On May 2, according to the New York Herald Tribune, King con-
ﬁrmed in Atlanta a report that Negroes plan to go to registration
and voting points in the hundreds and thousands, refusing to move
until relief is obtained. He endorsed the statement of an associate
that “the greatest progress of the American Negro in the future will
not be made in Congress or in the Supreme Court; it will come in
the jails.” Negroes must, he said, refuse to dissipate money and energy
in raising bail and carrying on countless time-consuming legal battles,
and choose jail instead, emulating the Indians in their non-violent
struggle for independence under Gandhi.

Shortly thereafter, Roy Wilkins, speaking at a conference of
NAACP leaders also in Atlanta, according to the New York Times
of May 8, announced on behalf of the NAACP a “wade-in” cam-
paign on Jim Crow beaches from Cape May, N. J., to Brownsville,
Texas. Negroes, Wilkins pointed out, pay taxes to maintain the public
beaches and “they get hot just like white folks do” and they are
going swimming “this summer.” Along with this wade—in campaign,
school and lunch counter integration and voting registration are to
be vigorously pressed.

Acﬁon Nof Words

REVOLUTIONS, however, are not made by militant statements. Nor for
that matter are they successfully carried out by a series of spontaneous
demonstrations. Given the external conditions which make radical
changes desirable, and in a sense necessary, success depends upon a
creative integration of mass need and impulse, on the one hand, and
great dedicated leadership on the other.

Whether in the current Southern struggle words are to be translated
into competent and sustained action is, with the exception of the
issue of nuclear war, the most important question before the American
people today. We used the word “revolution” advisedly a moment
ago. If Negroes come out of the current struggles with their feet

12

firmly set on the road to equality, recognized as human beings (with-
out quibble or reservation), the whole structure of Southern society
will be transformed. A “way of life” will cease to be. The people who
have lived under it—whites and Negroes a1ike—will be liberated.

'l'he transformation of the social structure will have all kinds of
repercussiolis. The Democratic Party in the South will be shattered.
In its present form and structure it will disappear, which is not the
least of the reasons why Southern Democratic politicians are so
bitterly opposed to the integration movement and why they are so
indifferent to the advantages that accrue to Russian propaganda from
the persistence of discrimination in this country. It is needless to add
that the demise of the Southern Democratic Party as now constituted
will in turn have repercussions elsewhere.

(Those who observed the recent Democratic convention in Los
Angeles were afforded concrete evidence of the shattering effect of
the sit-in movement. More than any other single issue, the sympa-
thetic reference to these sit—ins contained in the party platform infuri-
ated the Dixiecrats. Indeed, this was the central point of contention
around which the liberal-reactionary conﬂict swirled. This cleavage
forced in the Democratic convention is a powerful illustration of
the repercussions of direct action on political institutions. Thus the
Southern Negro students, without votes, ﬁnances or organization,
made a greater impact in this political year than any of the well-heeled
adult organizations in the ﬁeld.)

If the Negro liberation movement succeeds, this means that white
and Negro workers in the South will accept each other as human
beings, and will be organized into mass unions. In turn, this means
that the color line will be wiped out in all unions. Moreover, the
organization of Southern labor and the accompanying impetus to
organization elsewhere will almost certainly lead to a much greater
strengthening of the labor movement and a deeper transformation of
its social vision even than that which took place during the upsurge
of organization in the late Thirties and early Forties.

No Guarantee

SUCH THINGS -may happen. There is no ‘‘law’’ which says they must.
Despite inspiring and heroic episodes in the liberation struggle and
despite the occasional emergence of appealing ﬁgures among adults
or youth, no true revolution and renewal will take place without plan-
ning, without program, without leadership and discipline and sacri-
ﬁce. Without these, vested interests and conservative instincts among
Negroes will assert themselves. This has already happened where Negro
teachers don’t want public school integration “hurried,” although it's
been waiting for a century, and Negro bishops don’t want churches in-
tegrated, although they should have been for the past nineteen
centuries. The politicians who want to see the status quo maintained
in American life generally will seize the opportunity to provide so-
called ‘‘leadership’’ to direct discontent into safe channels. They will
neutralize the one element—the Negroes of the U.S. and especially of
the South—who, driven by their immediate needs and grievances,
could provide the driving force to break the crust of custom and
apathy and reinvigorate American life with élan and vision. Lacking
this, American life may remain outwardly tolerable for a time. But
for its own people it will be stale and frustrating, and it will have
lost “the struggle for the minds of men.”

Because so much is at stake for America, Northerners must submit
for consideration suggestions about the conduct of the struggle.

Those who undertake revolution, as do those in the South who call

14

 

 

for freedom and human equality for Negroes, are obligated to do
their best to see it through. Whether they like it or not they have
undertaken a job which cannot be accomplished through the existing
social and political machinery. It is to a large extent the existing
structures and mechanisms which prevent accomplishment, as we are
freshly reminded by the much-touted civil rights bill recently passed
allegedly to facilitate registration of Negroes. Under the circumstances,
action which is illegal under current deﬁnitions cannot be avoided.

Mass Ac!-Ion—The Source of Power

WHERE DOES THE POWER reside which can advance the movement for
Negro liberation? As we saw clearly during the Montgomery Bus
Protest and the lunch-counter sit-ins, it lies in mass action by the
Negro people. This is not merely a matter of numbers, though they
are important. It is a matter of human solidarity, of the social power
that is generated when people who had been fragmented individuals,
because they accepted inferior status, are transformed by their com-
mon demand for freedom. It is the power which suddenly causes an
imposing structure of custom, law, authority and force to crumble
because people unitedly stop respecting it and conforming to it.

To assert that power derives from mass direct action is not to say
that other means such as legislative and judicial procedures have no
place. It is to say that without direct action they are impotent, may
even be diversionary and enfeebling. It is to say that they must
supplement and serve direct action, not the reverse.

Mass action is a mere gesture unless those who engage in it are
prepared for mass arrests. These are almost certain to take place. At
that point again the logic of mass action has to be followed. Without
claiming that in all cases accepting bail, pleading not guilty and
standing trial, appealing cases to higher courts and paying ﬁnes must
be rejected—such legal procedures cannot be the central policy of a
mass movement. They eat up money. They are likely to stall further
mass action until, months or years later, such legal battles are decided.
All this amounts to acquiescing in the slow grinding of the machinery
which exists precisely to prevent the changes the mass movement seeks.

The thesis that mass action leads to jail applies to leaders as well
as the rank and ﬁle. When one observes newly independent countries
these days, in Asia or Africa, one ﬁnds that practically every cabinet
member, every leading trade unionist, writer and professional man,
served one or more terms in prison for challenging the old regime.
We are stating an obvious and often demonstrated fact, and not
attempting to “tell somebody what to do,” when we assert that leaders
in the present Negro liberation movement cannot expect students and
workers to heed the advice not to accept bail or pay ﬁnes but to go
to jail instead if these leaders do not follow their own advice.

The Soufhe-rn Base

FOR THE FIRST TIME since Booker T. Washington’s days Negro leader-
ship has shifted to the South. The recognized leader of the mass move-
ment, the symbol that serves to identify the struggle and evokes
emotion, leading people, Negro and white, to identify with it (or
react against it) is Martin Luther King. King is a Southerner, and
his work has been and is in the South. The leadership now has to be
in the South, because that is where the crucial battle is taking place.
Negroes can take mass action in the South and are driven to it because
they have no alternative. Individual Negro experience may vary, but
the Negro people will remain in bondage and humiliation unless the
South’s Negroes achieve freedom and the dignity of being recognized
as belonging to the one human family.

This is not to say that the North is irrelevant to the Southern
struggle. Far from it. In the North, Negroes and whites confront vast.
areas of de facto Jim Crow though the law preaches equality. The
most obvious and glaring case in point is the reality of the Northern
Negro ghetto which makes the attempt at school integration a farce.
In addition, the Northern civil rights movement is much more re-
sourceful in terms of organization, money, political power, and so on.
Clearly, these must be mobilized to support the Southern struggle if
it is to prevail.

Organizations like the NAACP and CORE have an important role
to play. The NAACP (as will be discussed in greater detail later on)
is the historic, mainstream organization of Negro protest in the United
States. The present stage of the civil rights movement is directly
related to the NAACP’s magniﬁcent legal struggle in the courts, and

must be supplemented by a continuation of that ﬁght. CORE, of
more recent origin, has pioneered in the application of direct action
tactics to the problem of Jim Crow.

Indeed, the point is not to supplant or eliminate the existing civil
rights movement. That would be foolish——an aid to the racists. The
point is that a new and dynamic factor must be recognized: the
emergence of a Southern Negro leadership. The older institutions
must, and will, remain. At the same time we must understand the
importance, the decisive importance, of this new development.

Role of file Church

A SECOND ELEMENT in the strategy of the Southern struggle must be
noted. We have commented on the symbolic and political signiﬁcance
of the fact that Martin King is a Southerner. He is also an ordained
clergyman and was the pastor of a local church when the Montgomery
Bus Protest occurred and swept him into leadership. That a preacher
emerged as the leader of so formidable a social movement while re-
maining ﬁrmly rooted in the church as an institution—a very unusual
development—is due to the special character of the Negro church,
especially in the South. The fact that King's associates in the leadership
of the broad movement and in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference itself are also ministers of course reinforces this point.

Psychologically, in spite of the “other worldliness” expressed in
familiar spirituals such as “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,” the church
has been the channel for the expression of the Negroes’ anguish under
slavery and the unquenchable thirst for freedom and dignity, as
evidenced in such spirituals as “Let My People Go.” The church in
the South has been the chief, almost the only, place where men of
talent could rise. The leadership of preachers in the integration move-
ment parallels the experience of the British unions in their early
period a century or more ago when lay preachers in the Non-con-
formist chapels emerged as leaders. But perhaps the most important
element making it possible for the Negro church to play a revolu-
tionary role is the fact that it is the only institution in the Negro
community that is completely independent of white economic control.
But this fact—the economic independence of the Negro Church—is of
primary importance only to the point where the struggle is conceived
of solely in racial terms and under present conditions. As we explore
the wider scope of the Negro freedom movement it will become appar-
ent that the church operates under severe limitations, and that new
sources of leadership must be tapped.

We come now to the last major aspect of a viable approach to the
problem of liberation for the Negro people. We have referred to
Martin Luther King and have pointed out that he is and had to be
a Southerner and a preacher. Does anyone think that if he had been

pastor of Wesley Methodist Church in Boston, Buffalo, or Los Angeles,
he would be in the position in which he ﬁnds himself today? Now
King is also an exponent and practitioner of non-violent direct action
and this is of importance quite apart from the religious basis which
he has for it. Speaking politically, non-violence has to be the program
of this movement.

Sfrafegic Non-Violence

SPORADIC RESORT to violence in self-defense or even in retaliation is

‘understandable in some situations in the Deep South. It is unfor-

 

 

tunately likely that there will be such instances. But the idea of
solving the problem of Negroes in the South by guerilla war tactics,
as some have suggested, is bizarre and unrealistic. It is hard to
believe that anyone who is capable of visualizing what it would lead
to in practice can seriously propose that Negroes and whites should
engage in a race for small arms and baby bombs. The explicit en-
dorsement of armed force by even a small minority of the Southern
civil rights forces could only lead to one of the most horrible blood-
baths in history. The Negroes could not hope to win an arms race
against the fanatic racist forces of the Deep South. Moreover, if
Southern Negroes are suﬂiciently united and determined to be able
to make some kind of showing in armed conﬂict, they will have no
need of arms to make the present machinery of repression inoperative.
Given adequate unity and deter1nination—as the sit-ins have dem-
onstrated—success can be achieved non-violently, even by small groups.

One does not need to be a Gandhian paciﬁst to see the appropriate-
ness of non-violent tactics for the civil rights struggle today. A con-
sideration of such ideas is of great importance to those of strong
philosophical or religious inclination, but a concern over whether
violence is ever justiﬁable is irrevelant to the present situation. Actions
like the Montgomery Bus Protest and the current sit-ins can be sup-
portedenthusiastically by all partisans of civil rights, whether paciﬁst
or not, because they are effective in achieving their goals while at
the same time undercutting the possibilities of violent reprisals and
counter-reprisals. A violent response could only serve to drive the bulk
of the uninvolved whites into the hands of the extremist minority
which has been molesting the demonstrators. The non-violent response
has in fact succeeded in isolating the ultra-racist elements in a num-
ber of situations.

The sit-ins have demonstrated two basic social functions of non-
violent direct action:
» 'a) It simultaneously destroys the old institutions and constructs

new ones in their place.
b) It immobilizes the state,’i.e., its police apparatus.
-Throughout the South, the students have made it clear that if there

18

 

 

 

are to be any lunch counters at all, they must be integrated. Segregated
lunch counters have in many areas been closed dowr1, i.e., destroyed
as institutions. In a number of cities they have been reopened on an
integrated basis, i.e., as new institutions. The same process, of course,
has been at work in the ﬁeld of public education. The issue becomes
integrated school or no school at all, and the dilemma is surely to
be resolved in favor of the former.

March 5, Nashville.‘ “Police lead the Rev. James Lawson (between UPI Photo

two officers, front) from the First Baptist
Church following his arrest here March 4th.
Rev. Lawson, described as one of the leaders
of recent lunch counter sit—ins, was arrested
on a warrant charging conspiracy to disrupt
trade and commerce.”

This function of non-violence has been expressed in dilferent
language. Martin King exhorts his fellow Negroes to “love their
enemies.” There is good reason to think that a good many young
people especially misunderstand that phrase or simply do not get
a coherent picture from it all. It does not mean having a senti-
mental liking for people who spit on you. What is involved may be
stated in the following terms.’ ’

The objective of the integration movement is to remove the present

19

 

 

 

 

social structure, which makes some masters over others. At present it
is so ordered that human beings, if their skin is dark, are humiliated,
and other human beings, if their skin is light, subject neighbors to
humiliation—which means that they too are humiliated: They are
degraded by the system under which they live. Community is impos-
sible under such a structure. Suspicion and fear and neurosis are
generated by it. Ultimately, the social fabric is torn asunder and
individuals react with hysteria. A weird nightmare of “black su-
premacy” tortures the sleep of Southerners caught in the pattern of
“white supremacy" and therefore unable to conceive of another basic
pattern in which men might live together as humans. The objective,
then, is to develop in the South and elsewhere a truly democratic
social structure, a community of non-violence and equality.

All this ﬁnally means that in carrying on their relentless non-violent
struggle for their own liberation, Negroes are liberating white South-
erners. This is the basic way in which the former express their “love”
for the latter. V/Vhite Southerners could not hand true freedom to
Negroes, even if they wanted to. Nobody can bestow freedom on those
who do not want it. And to “want” in this context does not mean
having a pale wish for freedom but a hunger which can no longer be
denied. It means to demand freedom and to be ready to die for it.

The second function of non-violence, its ability to immobilize the
police apparatus, scarcely needs elaboration. The wave of student
protest produced not one 1ynching—nothing like the police atrocities
one might have expected given the tradition of Southern “law enforce-
ment” agents. This time the racists had to depend on the harassment
and intimidation by white hoodlums who dropped lighted cigarettes
down the backs of the demonstrators and attacked them with baseball
bats. That the racists had to rely on such elements indicates the extent
to which the traditionally severe police forces were paralyzed.

This is a brief analysis of the movement which appeared so dra-
matically in the spring of 1960. We have already gone well beyond
the headlines. But now this analysis must be placed in a deeper
historical context. Out of this there will emerge a much clearer per-
spective of the direction of this movement in the future. Themes
which have been touched upon in passing——the role of the Democratic
Party, the position of the labor movement, and so on——wi1l be more
thoroughly examined.

First, then, let us place the struggle of the Southern students in its
historical setting. Then, with an analysis of the present movement
and of the past, we can turn to the question of action for the future.""

II. THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM

THE STRUGGLE of the Negro for equality represents one of the most
heroic aspects of American history. Heroic not only because it was
fought frequently in the face of lynch mobs and at the risk of life
and limb, but also because it was all too often fought without major
white allies. Throughout most of the last and present century, with
the exception of signiﬁcant sections of the growing labor movement
and not-always-steadfast liberals, the Northern white community, hav-
ing supported the liberation of the Negro to the point of toppling
the impedimentary plantation system, was content to abandon the
Negro to the new wage-slavery.

The Negro under slavery was not so submissive as widely imagined.
The slave revolts of the 18th and 19th centuries, as yet a largely
unexplored historical phenomenon, are touchstones of the cruelty
of the plantation system and a starting point for any examination of
the Negro protest movement. Best known of the uprisings were the
Gabriel plot of 1800, which involved up to 50,000 Negroes and nearly
managed to take Richmond; the Denmark Vessey conspiracy of 1822,
which planned to take Charleston, seize the ships and return to
Africa; and the Nat Turner uprising in 1831, also near Richmond.
There were also others. The defeated leaders were often hanged,
burned alive, their heads displayed on poles, etc. This was the fate
of a group of Negroes who marched on New Orleans in 1811 and
were defeated after pitched battle with regular troops.

Dulols vs. Washington

IN TRACING the origins of organized, national Negro protest, we have
reference to two conﬂicting tendencies among Negro leaders, coming
to a head at the beginning of this century. For a small number of
freed Negroes (the so-called “Talented Tenth”) higher educational
opportunities had been made available at the newly opened Negro
colleges (Fisk, Atlanta, Howard, Hampton, etc.) and out of this
number grew the beginnings of a Negro intelligentsia. From this
intellegentsia would spring the leadership of the civil rights move-
ment. One of the products, probably the most outstanding, of the
new Negro university was W. E. B. DuBois.

The Negro movement at this time was dominated by the con-
ciliatory policies of Booker T. Washington. Washington and his
followers advocated a program of industrial training and economic
self-elevation as the road to Negro advancement. Setting up technical
training schools, advising thrift and attention to mechanical abilities,
the Washington group assiduously avoided any actions that might

21

 

antagonize white people, and de-emphasized the importance of higher
education as well as social and political equality. “The wisest of my
race,” wrote Washington, “understand that agitation of questions of
social equality is of the extremest folly.” The wisest of his race was
soon to repudiate Washington's timid approach!

The growing antipathy among Negro intellectuals to Washington's
conciliatory policies found for its spokesman W. E. B. DuBois. The
latter’s platform included a “stoppage to the campaign of Negro
depreciation” and a militant program for the achievement of political,
social and economic equality.

In 1904 a conference between the two forces took place at Carnegie
Hall in New York City. DuBois demanded that “the general watch-
word must be, not to put forth dependence on the help of the whites,
but to organize for self help, encouraging ‘manliness without deﬁance,
conciliation without servility’.” Out of this conference came the
Committee of Twelve for the Advancement of the Interest of the
Negro Race.

In 1905 DuBois quit the Committee of Twelve when it became
obvious that it was the tool of Washington, and he organized the
Niagara Movement (named after its meeting place in Niagara Falls,
New York). The movement had as its main objectives active opposi-
tion to the reactionary policies of Washington and the generation of
a more militant policy of struggle against Jim Crow. It consisted of
an all-Negro intelligentsia of doctors, 1awyers,'teachers, social workers
and preachers—54 men representing 18 states.

NAACP is Born

IN 1909 the NAACP was formed out of a union between DuBois’i

Niagara Movement and white Northern liberals and socialists of the
abolitionist tradition. As a result of a series of race riots that had
occurred in this period—the most brutal having taken place in Lin-
coln’s hometown of Springﬁeld, Illinois—white liberals were aroused
and the abolitionist spirit enjoyed something of a moderate revival.
Leading whites in the formation of the NAACP included William
English Walling, Mary Ovington, Dr. Henry Moskowitz, Oswald
Garrison Villard, Jane Addams, William Lloyd Garrison,  G. Phelps
Stokes and John Haynes Holmes. (Socialists can take pride in recall-
ing that most of these white founders of the NAACP—as well as
DuBois for a time—were members of the Socialist Party. Dubois, un-
fortunately, abandoned the Socialist Party and became a Communist.
The loss of this brilliant mind to the most vulgar Stalinist apologetics
—and hence isolation—was a tragedy for the Negro people.) The
ofﬁcers of the new organization were white with the exception of
DuBois. The program was almost identical to that of the Niagara
Movement. By 1914 there were thirteen Negro members on the Board

of Directors; to this day the Association is interracial at the top and

Today the NAACP has some 320,000 me111bers. Although its leader-
ship remains almost entirely middle class, its base has been substan-
tially broadened in recent years and includes working class elements.
In the South, where half of its chapters are located, it has played a
courageous role against dangerous odds. Its leaders have been threat-
ened, blacklisted, beaten and murdered. In many parts of the~South,
the Constitution and Bill of Rights would be virtually inoperative

but for the NAACP’s tremendous efforts. It wields the inﬂuence of a
continuing organizational form which contributes in a major way to
the ﬁght for civil rights and has in turn been greatly strengthened in
that struggle. g

The NAACP is thus an indispensable instrument in the battle for
civil rights. Time and again it has stood in the forefront of the prog-
ress made by American Negroes toward equality. Negroes recognize
this and all the enemies of the Negro have shown, by the virulence
of their attacks on the NAACP, that they recognize it too.

There are some radicals and militants who have for one reason or
another abandoned the NAACP in discouragement or disillusionment,
or for sectarian reasons have never supported it. We can to some
extent sympathize with their critique, but their approach to the pres-.
ent situation is based on a misunderstanding both of the crucial role
of the NAACP and of the attachment of the Negro community to it.

In today’s climate especially, a weakening of the NAACP would
constitute a major victory for those seeking to hold back the Negro.
It would not lead to a stron-ger movement for civil rights now or in
the future. This is not to say that other groups in the ﬁeld—CORE,
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Negro American
Labor Council, local committees, etc.—do not play a vital role and
should not be supported. Presumably no informed person would con-
sider it realistic to propose that a single individual or organization
should have a monopoly of work for civil rights. But all such consid-
erations hold good only on condition that there must be no minimiz-
ing of theiNAACP’s role, but on the contrary, a clear appreciation of
its historic and present status.

We urge those who criticize it for being “too slow” or “too bureau—
cratic” or “too middle class” to participate more fully in the NAACP.
Only through greater—not 1ess—-support can the NAACP respond to
the challenge before it. It is only on the basis of supporting the
NAACP that relationships among various pro civil rights forces can
develop so as to strengthen the overall movement and give it the drive
to overcome those forces—varied, insidious and powerfu1—seeking to
destroy it.

There are, in our view, inadequacies and weaknesses in the present
civil rights movement which must be faced by the leadership and
membership of the NAACP. Dealing with such inadequacies raises
questions as to the program of the NAACP itself and as to the role
which other factors in the total movement may conceivably have to ﬁll.

As the NAACP has developed, it has tended to devote the greater
part of its energies to working through the courts. In part, this
emphasis can be understood in terms of the handicap under which
the organized civil rights movement has had to ﬁght for most of its
life: the principle of racial equality had had no legal expression. No

24

 

 

protection was afforded the Negro under the courts. The situation
today has changed, and there must be a corresponding change in the
strategy of the NAACP.

The Courts

IMPORTANT as court action is in the movement for civil rights, it is
only one weapon and when depended upon to the exclusion of other
weapons, can become virtually meaningless. Militant political activity,
above and beyond litigation, on the part of the Negro is essential in
determining what decisions the courts will make with regard to civil
rights and whether the decision will be enforced. In the absence of
this activity the Court can always rule adversely (and has a long
history of doing so) ; ultimate faith cannot be placed in the wisdom
of any handful of men. V

The historic 1954 Supreme Court decision on school desegregation
did not even pretend to be based solely on technical legal precedents
with no relation to the sociological and political implications of seg-
regation in the U.S. There is no question but that the Court also
took into account the fact that segregation is an albatross around the
government’s neck in the Cold War, discrediting us among the uncom-
mitted in Asia and Africa. Undoubtedly, too, it took into account
the protest an unfavorable decision would have incited among Negroes
at home and the embarrassment this would have caused us abroad in
terms of the image of national unity. If the American Negro were
not growing impatient with the immoral acquiescence of the federal
government in segregation, if he were still a submissive nonentity in
public life, who could say the Supreme Court would not have had
an easier time in upholding school segregation? To believe this is to
reveal an ignorance of fundamental politics.

Once again», the 1954 decision also points up the necessity for mass
political mobilization in terms of the enforcement of Court decisions.
For, although the organization of the Negro has set the groundwork
for the enunciation of the principle of school desegregation, it has
not been such as to succeed in effecting its enforcement. On October
12, 1959, the Supreme Court refused to review two decisions upholding
the constitutionality of the insidious pupil-placement laws and reject"-‘
ing Negro suits to make school boards draft total desegregation plans.
Thus, the Court has opened the way for the substitution of token
integration for real integration.

At this writing, the 1954 decision has been primarily elfective only
in the Border states. Almost six years after the decision, Alabama,
Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida and South Carolina have
taken virtually no steps toward school integration. And, according to
the National Labor Service, “ﬁve other states—Arkansas, Virginia,
North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas—are either divided in their

25

  

compliance with the Court’s ruling or are delaying desegregation.”
Furthermore, the New York Times recently reported that 94% of all
Negro students in the South still attend segregated classes—in other
words, itlhas taken six years to integrate 6%. At this rate of 1% per
year, integration might be completed in the year 2054! With the
Supreme Court’s action last October 12th, however, the South now
has a legal device with which to delay integration even further.

In the April 3, 1959 issue of Look, Fred Rodell, professor of law at
Yale University, pointed out that “without a criminal statute, deseg-
regation has no teeth . . . \/Vithout more and more Supreme Court
decisions [which have not been forthcoming] the South can go on
using all manner of devices that get around the letter of the original
ruling until each in its turn is forbidden.” (Emphasis supplied.)

Obviously, to end segregation under these terms would take decades.
There are 10,000 school boards in the deﬁant states. In each county
Negroes would have to press for admission in the face of local in-
timidation from their landlord. They would have to appeal to the
court against school boards, then for contempt citations, and then?
Years pass. . . .

Here we have a parallel with the development of the labor move-
ment in the U.S. The Wagner Act did not organize a single union. It
established the right to organize, but set no criminal penalties for
violating this right. A cumbersome machinery was set up. One case
against Weirton Steel ﬁnally reached a conclusion some ten years
after it had been begun; by then the union was dead. Nevertheless
the legal logjam was broken not in the courts, but as unionism won
its decisive victories in sit down strikes and on picket lines!

Likewise the Supreme Court decision does not in itself force the
desegregation of a single school! It puts the question in a new legal
framework and prepares a thousand court cases. But equality can
become a reality, the decision can be enforced, only if teeth are put
into it. And this means unremitting pressure from below.

Congress and the Execuﬁve

IT IS NOT ENoUGH—indeed it is sometimes futile—to secure victories in
the courts, unless Congress passes legislation putting teeth into the
victories, unless Congress makes it a crime to violate one’s civil rights.
Part III of the Douglas-Javits Civil Rights Bill was precisely such a
piece of legislation. Thanks to the reactionary Republican-Dixiecrat
coalition in Congress, this Bill was shelved and a meaningless, watered-
down version put in its place.

What was accomplished by the similarly watered-down Civil Rights
Act of 1957? This Act set up two principal bodies—the Civil Rights
Division of the Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Com-
mission. Their achievements to date have been pathetic. The Civil

Rights Division has not yet enabled one Negro to vote! This is the
judgment not of the NAACP, but of the Division's sibling, the Civil
Rights Commission. Of the three voting cases it has brought before
the Federal courts two have been thrown out, the third has not yet
been tried. The Division has functioned so poorly that the Com-
mission has asked Congress for the right to represent itself from now
on! Nor has the Civil Rights Commission been able to do very much,
for while segregation and disfranchisement deprive the Negroes and
other minority groups of 30 billion dollars a year in wages, Congress
has granted the Commission only $750,000 for its work.

The 1960 Civil Rights Bill has been recognized as an utter hoax.
Tossing aside the recommendations of the Civil Rights Commission
for swift executive intervention where voting rights are denied, Con-
gress substituted a plan which is more of a hindrance to Negroes
seeking the vote than a help. Again the Dixiecrat-Republican coali-
tion, meeting shamelessly little resistance from Northern “liberals,”
wrote out in liberal language a bill that in reality places the burden
of securing voting rights on the individual Negro and subjects him
to a mass of expensive legal red tape. This bill can only discourage
him from prosecuting his right juridically.

Thus we are confronted by a cycle of inaction, whereby the civil
rights decisions by the Court are gutted by the failure of Congress to
set up honest enforcement machinery, and also by the reluctance of
the Executive branch of government to use the enforcement powers
it already has (which is not too surprising since the President o-f the
United States still refuses to make a statement in favor of the school
desegregation decision) .

Referring to the President’s Committee on Government Contracts,
the N. Y. Times of November 16, 1959 reported that “instead of
asking contractors for a generalized and practically unenforceable com-
mitment not to discriminate, the committee is now seeking a speciﬁc
promise to hire Negroes for new jobs immediately.” The same govern-
ment that ﬁled an injunction automatically sending half a million
steelworkers back to the plants tells us it is incapable of enforcing
non-discrimination in companies getting government contracts—paid
for by Negro and white tax-payers! Rather than pursue this essential
task, which strikes at the heart of the problem, the President's Com-
mittee has decided instead to persuade a handful of contractors to
hire or upgrade two handsful of Negroes. The Times article goes on
to state that “It [the Committee] can ask the contracting department
of the Government to cancel a contract because of discriminatory
hiring policies, and it has asked occasionally. But no department has
yet broken a contract for that reason.” (Emphasis supplied.)

To sum up: experience has shown that working through the courts
is an important, but very limited aspect of the struggle. The courts

INTRODUCTORY MESSAGE

The reader who favors racial equality may wonder what there is to write
about it that requires this thick booklet. Indeed, many advocates of inte-
gration regard it as a rather simple issue: either one is for human equality
and dignity or one is opposed to them. In a sense this is absolutely true. But
the advocate of racial justice who stops there cannot possibly bring his full
weight to bear in the ﬁght for integration. For, as the author of this excellent
pamphlet points out, the achievement of civil rights requires an intelligent
program of action based upon the most careful political and historical analy-
sis and understanding. Without these, the magniﬁcent movement for racial
equality in America is destined to lose battles which it might otherwise win
and to delay unnecessarily the achievement of its overall goal of full inte-
gration.

For these reasons this pamphlet can be an invaluable tool for the civil
rights movement. It cuts through the thick fog of rhetoric so prevalent in pro-
fessional “liberal” circles and focuses a powerful searchlight on the biggest
political stumbling block to progress for civil rights: the Dixiecrat-Republican
alliance in Congress. And it points out the way to shatter this reactionary
alliance: through a radical political realignment in America.

In the ﬁght for realignment, the Socialist Party is uniquely situated to
play a spearhead role. For unlike the liberal Democrats and others, our Party
has absolutely no compromising ties of any kind with the Dixiecrats. Further-
more, it is our avowed aim to drive a wedge between the liberals and racists
and utterly to isolate and destroy the latter as a political and social force. In
that ﬁght we welcome the support of, and pledge our loyal cooperation with,
all democratic elements seeking these same goals. Our unalterable aim is a
grand alliance of all who genuinely want and are prepared to ﬁght for com-
plete racial equality in America.

The Socialist Party"-Social Democratic Federation is deeply grateful to the
author of this excellent paper, Tom Kahn, for his permission to publish it
in a special "edition under the imprint of our Party. We are proud that it
was written by one whose understanding was forged in the course of active
membership in both the Socialist Party and the civil rights movement. We
cordially invite all who share our principles and wish to join us in the ﬁght
for social justice to become members of the Socialist Party or our youth
section, the Young People’s Socialist League.

can make high-sounding statements of principle, but if Congress does
not provide law-enforcement legislation, such statements are virtually
meaningless. Congress and the Executive may unleash ﬂoods of
righteous rhetoric, they may set up innumerable committees and sub-
committees, but in the testing the rhetoric has been revealed to be
transparent hypocrisy and the committees and subcommittees a mere
multiplicity of letterheads. If this situation is to be reversed, it must
be by the relentless pressure of an organized movement of the Negro
masses themselves—not just their lawyers and specialists—ﬁghting on
all fronts, for social, political and economic equality. ‘

The Negro and Mass Acﬁon’

DEVELOPMENTS in this direction have been encouraged by two out-
standing Negro leaders: A. Philip Randolph, President of the Brother-
hood of Sleeping Car Porters, whose March on Washington Move-
ment (1941-2) forced Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802, setting up
the FEPC; and the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the Mont-
gomery Bus Protest and President of the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference.

Both are supporters of the NAACP, but have urged a program
which, while continuing litigation, recognized the necessity for mass
mobilization to maintain pressure on the agencies of government.
Under their leadership, thousands and tens of thousands of people
have organized independently of the big political machines in direct
action projects on behalf of civil rights.

In 1956, the Montgomery Bus Protest strangled segregation in the
city’s buses as 50,000 Negroes for months traveled by foot and swiftly-
organized car pools. The success of this spontaneous and heroic
struggle resounded internationally and projected the symbol of a new
spirited independence stirring in the Southern Negro. For, in addition
to its tactical victory, the‘ Montgomery movement offered the Negro
citizens the opportunity to participate bodily, directly, in the winning
of their rights. The almost total absence from the Montgomery
Negro population of criminal offense during the protest indicates the
importance of deep involvement in social struggle as a constructive
release from the frustrations and humiliations of segregation and
discrimination.

(Unfortunately, owing both to its structure and political orienta-
tion, the NAACP has not provided such involvement on a mass scale.
The NAACP, as mentioned above, has placed almost exclusive em-
phasis on working through the courts. Obviously, the intricacies of
liti-gation do not offer possibilities of wide participation. A further
example of the NAACP’s failure in this regard was the National
Board's suspension of Robert Williams, President of the Union Coun-
ty, N.‘C. branch, when he called upon Negroes to “meet violence with

28

violence.” More important than the bureaucratic procedure of the
Board is the fact that the Williams statement grew out of a widespread
frustration in the Negro community. This frustration the NAACP has
failed to channel through the organization and direction of mass
action along the lines of the Montgomery movement.)

Organized on the heels of the Montgomery victory, the Prayer
Pilgrimage brought some 17,000 Negroes and whites to Washington
in celebration of the third anniversary of the 1954 Supreme Court
school desegregation decision. The moving spirits behind the event,
ﬁnancially backed by the NAACP, were A. Philip Randolph and
Martin King.

Youfh Marches

THE 1958 YOUTH MARCH for Integrated Schools, also led by the Ran-
dolph-King forces, not only dropped the religious format, but ad-
dressed itself to youth, organizing an interracial march of 10,000
young peole to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. This time,
however, the NAACP (lid not give anything like real support.
However, the extraordinary success of the first March and the
enthusiasm it had built up in a wide variety of groups, caused the
NAACP’s leadership to urge full chapter participation in the second
March. On April l8, 1959, 30,000 young people converged on Wash-
ington, bearing 400,000 signatures to petitions demanding federal
action to ensure speedy school integration. The signiﬁcance of the
second March lay to a large extent in the fact that, tripling the size of

29

 

 

its predecessor, it succeeded in prying a reception from the White
House, which had ignored the October March.

While we should not expect much in the way of civil rights to come
through benign concessions from the White House, and do not place
much hope in the President's promises, the fact remains that in the
context of forcingvrecognition from the government and wresting
propaganda concessions—which is all such demonstrations as presently
conceived can expect—the White House reception demonstrated the
bargaining power inherent in numbers. ‘

That the Marches did not project the militancy radicals believe was
demanded by the occasions, and did not make the political impact
on Washington politicians that many of its supporters had hoped for,
indicates not the inherent implausibility of mass activity, but the
weakness of its present stage of organization.

Soclol Dislocafion

AT THE END of the projects, the local Youth March committees that
had sprung into action in scores of communities and schools petered
out, lacking the nourishment of continued activity. Large demonstra-
tions serve to arouse mass support, to give notice of strength, to
culminate campaigns; but demonstrations cannot take the place of
constant, organized grass roots activity, which involves the great mass
of the Negro people on a day-to-day basis, which becomes part of
them, their own movement. This is the lesson and meaning of the
Montgomery Bus Protest. And this is the experience, too, of the Amer-
ican labor movement. The parallel is not superﬁcial. It is profound
in its implications. For both movements, there were very few friends
indeed on the court benches, in the government, in the ruling circles;
and for both movements victory came through social dislocation, a
withdrawal of support from those agencies that deprived them of their
just rights. In Montgomery, the Negro population stayed off the b-uses
until the bus companies realized that the cost of protested segregation
was greater than the cost of integration. With the businessman’s sense
of proﬁt, the buses abandoned the color barrier. In like manner does
the laborer withdraw himself from the production lines by conducting
sit-down strikes, picket lines and boycotts. For both, the principle of
victory has been this: shift the cost of inequality and injustice from
the backs of the exploited and oppressed to the backs of the exploiters
and oppressorsl

Ill. ' THE NEGRO AND LABOR

AT THIS POINT we should go somewhat more deeply into the relation-
ship between the N_egroes’ ﬁght for freedom and the labor movement.
Indeed, an understanding of the gains already made by the Negro is
really impossible without an understanding of this relationship. Fur-
thermore, as this pamphlet hopes to demonstrate, a close alliance of
these movements is a fundamental key to the next stage of the ad-
vancement of racial equality in the United States.

Economics of Jim Crow

THE ECONOMIC BASE of segregation—the need for cheap labor—far from
having disappeared in the 20th century, remains today. Despite the
advances made by the Negro, he and other minority groups still pro-
vide exploited sources of proﬁt for Big Business, and not only in
the South. Although, largely through the labor movement, the Negro
and Puerto Rican have experienced some economic and social eleva-
tion in the North, these groups still provide the raw human material
for countless sweatshops and factories at incredibly low wages. And
the dirty jobs—janitorial workers, porters, domestics, etc.—are ﬁlled
almost exclusively by Negroes and Puerto Ricans, who are shut out
from better employment. In New York, Chicago, Detroit—al1 the
major industrial centers—there is afﬁxed to the personality of the
Negro the image of the menial, unskilled worker, an image which
degrades him in his own eyes and reinforces the belief among whites
that the Negro is suited only for these jobs.

That exploitation of the Negro and other minority groups is a con-
tinuing factor in the United States is documented by Herbert Hill,
NAACP labor secretary, who pointed out in an address before the
10th Constitutional Convention of the United Furniture Workers of
America, the following facts:

“In 1954 the average wage or salary income of a Negro worker had
risen to $131,589, while the average white worker earned $3,174. . . .

“In 1954, 17.6% of all white families in the U.S. were living on an
annual income of $2,000 or less, but of non-white families, 42.3% were
living on an annual income below $2,000.”

Not only do Negroes as a whole receive much lower wages than
whites, they are also the ﬁrst to suffer in times of economic crisis:

“During the week of March 9, 1958, 14.4% of the total non-white
civilian labor force in the U.S. was unemployed. The comparable rate
for white workers was 6.9%. Although only one out of every ten
persons in the U.S. labor force is non-white, more than one out of
every 5 persons currently unemployed is non-white.

31

 

 

“Almost without exception during the entire period since the 1953-4
recession, the unemployment gap between whites and non-whites has
been greater than prior to 1954. During the past 3 years, the non-
white unemployment rate has been almost consistently double the
white unemployment rate. . . . All available data clearly indicates that
the rate of unemployment among non-whites as compared to that of
whites has been steadily increasing since 1951. . . .” -

Mr. Hill concludes, “It is therefore evident that despite great
changes in the employment and occupational characteristics of the
Negro workers in the last decade, the economic level of Negroes
remains substantially below that of the white population.”

What does “substantially” mean? It means that the wages of the
Negro are half those of the white and his rate of unemployment is
double! 12

What does Big Business in America get out of this? According to
the National Labor Service, “minorities . . . would have earned $72
billion, given equal opportunity and earning power. Actually, they
earned only $42 billion (per year) .” That’s $30 billion a year in
stolen wages! Is it any wonder that business interests in the Republi-
can Party line up with the Dixiecrats to defeat meaningful civil rights
legislation in Congress? And is it any wonder that these same forces
combine to pushlfor anti-labor legislation? (It is no accident that the
Landrum-Griﬂin bill derives its name from a‘ Republican advocate of
unfettered “free enterprise” and a Southern Democrat respectively.)
A strong labor movement threatens to organize Negro workers in the
South (in which endeavor the just outlawed “secondary boycott”
would have been a valuable weapon) , and no union would permit its
members to work for $1,589 a year!

World War H

THOUGH THE LEADERSHIP in the ﬁght for democracy in the South has,
for the time, passed out of the hands of the labor movement, it was
in fact the rise of mass unionism that paved the way for the big
advance of the Negro struggle. The entry of the United States into
the Second World War and the consequent spurt in war production
absorbed the surplus labor born of the depression and created a new
need for manpower. This need, which was sharpened by the low ebb
of immigration (now severely regulated by the quota system) pro-
vided a great opening for the Negro in the industrial complex. It
meant, moveover, the inﬂux of the Negro on a large scale, into the
labor movement, speciﬁcally into the CIO, which had organized the
bulk of the mass production industries. The result was an economic
elevation of the Negro, as he began to share in the job security and
higher living standards won by the trade union movement.*

The elevation of the Negro in this period was not conﬁned to the
economic sphere, but was cultural and political as well. For the more
the Negro becomes integrated into the labor movement, the more he
resists and struggles against segregation outside.

* Although it was the war that was responsible for the creation of the labor
market, it was the pressing labor movement—-to which the war production
machine had to make some concessions for the preservation of national
unity—that established the wage-levels from which the Negro beneﬁted’. If
the employers had felt they could get away with it, there's no question
that they would have maintained the same program of economic discrimina-
tion against Negroes constructed in other sectors of the economy.

The improved economic status of the urban Negro, combined with
the need for an anti—Fascist face (requiring a subdual of domestic
racism) was reﬂected in various Supreme Court decisions on voting,
travel, education, etc. which tended to b-ring about a certain elevation
of the cultural level of the Negro.

‘ It was, we recall, also in this period that the leading Negro trade

unionist, A. Philip Randolph, led the March on Washington Move-

ment, forcing Roosevelt to issue the F EPC order. At the close of the
war however—with a mitigation of the need for a democratic face-
Congress refused to appropriate funds to keep the Federal FEPC in
operation. As the National Labor Service Fact Sheet on Equality of
Opportunity points out, “Minority workers in those states and cities
without local FEP laws lost the gains that were made during World
War II, and discriminatory practices were revived in many parts of
the country. . . . Although Federal FEP bills have been introduced
repeatedly in both houses of Congress for the past 13 years, an infor-
mal coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans
continues to block passage. Meanwhile, Negroes and other non-white
minorities continue to be paid far less than white workers, and their
lower wages drag down the living standard for all.”

Bagged Down

UNFORTUNATELY, after the burst of militant activity in the late thirties
and early forties—activity which saw Negroes pouring into the unions,
making a deep dent in the prejudices of millions, as Negroes and
whites joined in united class action, with the CIO demanding equal
rights for Negroes and condemning the poll tax—after this burst the
labor movement bogged down. The don’t-rock-the—boat philosophy
prevalent during the war (and, interestingly, encouraged by the
Communist Party) helped to conservatize the labor movement and
to bring it into closer cooperation with the government. This and
the tougher competition now coming from the AFL, as millions came
off the farms into the factories for the ﬁrst time, tended to distract
unionism from its important tasks with regard to the Negro.

Regardless of the amount of education of the non-white, therefore, his
income will tend to be less than his white educational equal, a factor
neglected in discussions of the Negro’s “lack of drive” to better himself.

Today, the united AFL—CIO appears preoccupied with its own
internal problems. Pointing to racketeering in some unions, the
enemies of labor have succeeded in discrediting the entire movement
in the eyes of many. On the defensive now, labor seems to have for-
gotten the pledge it made upon unity to undertake a widescale
organization of the South. At this writing, “Operation Dixie” has
been discontinued with no appreciable success recorded.

Another example of the job labor has left undone came out of the
1959 AFL—CIO national convention. When A. Philip Randolph pre-
sented a resolution calling for the expulsion of two railway unions
unless they removed “white on1y” clauses from their constitutions
by a speciﬁed date, President George Meany burst out: “Who the
hell appointed you guardian of all the Negroes in America?” This
attack upon the man who does not claim to, but indeed speaks for more
Negroes than probably anyone else, is, unfortunately, a barometer
of the unclarity that still exists in some parts of the labor movement
on the race question. And though we are anxious to emphasize that
the same attitudes do not prevail in the more progressive wing of the
labor movement, we also recognize the appalling fact that none of
the leaders of this wing was heard in defense of Randolph. We point
this out not to give the impression that these silent leaders are not
militantly for civil rights, but to contend that internal factional-
ism has been permitted to obscure the fundamental issue. In the
face of the overriding need for an unshakeable Negro-Labor alliance
which is vigorous and uncompromising in pursuit of the struggle,
petty politics is irresponsible.

Because of incidents like the above, some Negroes have come to
feel that the alliance between the Negro and the lab-or movement,
previously so effective, is ﬁnished; that labor has no fundamental
concern for the Negro, and that, indeed, it represents simply another
barrier to his advance toward equality.

35

 

 

The Negro-Labor Alliance

THIS POINT or VIEW is tragically mistaken. The labor movement must
ally itself with the Negro, not out of any inherent morality or toler-
ance, but because of its very social nature. The non-unionized Negro
is a potential scab. Moreover, the cheap labor which he and other
minority groups are forced to provide tends to drag down the wages
of other workers. Therefore, out of labor’s own interest it must open
its ranks to Negroes, strive for their inclusion and become their pri-
mary allies in the civil rights movement. .

This means union integration. Today’s Negro cannot be organized
extensively on a segregated, discriminatory basis. It is true, of course,
that there are segregated and discriminatory unions, as the report of
Herb Hill charged. It is also true, as we discussed earlier, that segre-
gation is still very much a factor in the Southern working class
psychology. Nevertheless, the labor movement may still claim a con-
siderably better record on this score‘ than any other organized force
in society. Segregation" as an institution within labor must of neces-
sity be a transient phenomenon.

On virtually every issue, the civil rights and labor movements ﬁnd
themselves on the same end of the ﬁring line and both are continually
betrayed by the Democratic and Republican parties. Out of the same
liberal Congress that labor and many Northern Negroes were in
large measure responsible for putting on Capitol Hill have come:
1) anti-labor legislation and 2) no civil rights legislation of substance.

Like Negroes, labor organizers are also intimidated in the South.
Unionists are beaten by thugs or jailed by the police in the South as
a matter of routine. Like the Negr0’s struggle in Dixie, the labor
movement’s ﬁght is marked by heroism and frustration. And labor
too has been battered by the Dixie courts. Earlier we gave the exam-
ple of VVeirton Steel. Moving South, the situation becomes more
severe and more common.

In 1953, Louisiana sugar cane plantation workers struck during
the harvest season. In October, after they had been on strike for 60
days, a state court issued a sweeping injunction at the behest of
plantation owners that made just about all strike activity illegal.
Two years later, the union’s appeal reached the U.S. Supreme Court
and . . . the state court was reversed, the injunction set aside. Regret-
tably, in those two years, the strike had been broken and the local
union wiped out. The legal victory was of some interest but hardly
overimportant to the plantation workers who were driven out of the
area or to those who remain at a wage of 411/2 cents an hour, the
legal minimum set by the Secretary of Agriculture.

 

 

 

IV. THE NEGRO AND AMERICAN POLITICS

Southern Poliﬁcs
IT SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT from the discussion thus far that conditions
of the Negro are the same all over the country, or that racism has
the same function for the Southern rulers that it has for Big Business.
Although in the South, as well as in the North, employer interests
stand to gain from the suppression of the Negro, segregation in the
South has an additional dimension: it is the basis of political rule.
The Democratic Party in New York, as corrupt and machine-ridden
as it is, does not rule on the basis of segregation. In the South it does.
That is to say, the political machine that has ruled the South for
many decades could not continue winning elections if it permitted
Negroes to vote! The senators and governors elected to oﬂice in the
South today are elected by tiny minorities. In 1954, it required only
100,848 votes for Eastland to return to the Senate. Since the population
of Mississippi in that year was 2,100,000, Eastland’s position is based
on the votes of less than 5% of the people of his own state.* It is on
such a thin base that Southern rule is perched. To this day Southern
officials receive fewer votes than the number of Negroes alone barred
from the polls. In many Southern states there are even more whites
disfranchised. Not only is the South a one—party region, but thatone
party is a minority party whose incumbents would be defeated at the
polls tomorrow if all citizens, regardless of color, were allowed to vote.
The rule of the Democratic Party in the South has meant the
suppression not only of the Negro, but of the poor white, the share-
cropper, the migrant farm worker as well. For, as we have indicated,
the Southern senators and congressmen join with the conservative
Republicans in Congress to restrict the labor movement, which is
the only hope of these classes for social, economic and political
advancement. Senator Eastland, who just happens to own 4,000 acres
of good Southern farmland, which just happens to be worked by
sharecroppers, would not be very happy to see a union on his
grounds. And Eastland is not the exception. Government and economy

* In 1956, Sen._ Javits of New York received 3,710,753 votes—17% of the
population (the percentage would not varymuch proportionately if we
spoke in terms of voting population). Moreover, Javits’ opponent received
3,244,648 votes, whereas Eastland, as is the Mississippi custom, ran virtually
unopposed. If one examines the relative ﬁgures in terms of total votes cast
in proportion to the population, the contrast is staggering. That Eastland
is elected through a one-party primary system and Javits through a two-
party system in no way alters the conclusions these ﬁgures suggest with
regard to “political democracy” in Mississippi.

37

in the South are in the grip of white supremacists and segregationists;
they man the police forces; they don judicial robes and run the
courts; they own the textile mills, the tobacco factories, the cotton
and soybean and sugar plantations and processing plants. Their
political and economic power hinges on the suppression of the Negro.

The Long Hand of Dixie

DESPITE THE FACT that Southern politicians are elected by piddling
minorities in their own states, the inﬂuence and power they wield
on the national political scene is prodigious. Thirteen Southern states
elect 26 senators and 120 representatives. This meant, in 1954 for
example, that they had, of the Democratic Congressional caucus, 26
out of 49 senators and 120 out of 232 representatives—a majority of
the Party apparatus in both Houses. Thus, in order for the Dixiecrats
to become a minority, the Party would have to gain a considerable
victory over the Republicans. And if they won such a victory? The
racists would become a numerical minority, but would retain their
grip on the machinery of Congress: we would again witness the gro-
tesque elevation of Eastland to the chairmanship of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee. Because Eastland and Company are returned to
Congress again and again (by the privileged franchised few in their
constituencies) they have accumulated more seniority than any other
group on Capitol Hill, and by the rules of Congress, committee
chairmanships are awarded to the senior members of the majority
party. It’s as simple as that. So simple that the election to Congress
of any Democrat, however liberal, from whatever part of the country,
is in eﬁect a vote for Eastland as chairman of the all—important Senate
Judiciary Committee—the Committee through which all civil rights
legislation is ﬁltered.

Revolufion

IN THE OPENING SECTION of this pamphlet we spoke of revolution. For
many the word conjures up a panorama of mass violence, hysteria
and bloodshed. Indeed, such violence has historically been attached
to virtually all revolutions and hence has come to be commonly
regarded as the central deﬁnition of revolution. This conception is
false.

By revolution we refer to that process by which existing institutions
which have outlived their usefulness, or which can no longer be
accepted, are destroyed and replaced by new ones. The essence of
revolution is the coming into action of masses of people; this is
what differentiates it from a “coup” or “palace revolt.” Hitherto the
method employed by the dissatisﬁed masses has been violence in
various degrees. C T

Without entering into an abstract discussion of the eﬂicacy of

38

 

 

non-violence for all situations, it has been the author’s position that
non-violence is the method that is mostseifective in the Southern
Negro’s revolution. Here we pit violence and non-violence against
each other as two different strategies, so to speak, one inﬁnitely more
effective in the situation than the other. But, as has been stated, the
essential feature of the struggle, whatever its techniques, must be
the involvement of masses in motion.

We have already described forms of mass action developed in the
civil rights movement, making reference to the experience of the labor
movement. We broke off this discussion to delve more deeply into
the relationship between the’ Negro and organized labor and also into
politics in the United States as it affects the Negro struggle. Later
on we shall return to mass action.

It is a dissipation of energy for the civil rights movement to wage
merely an ideological battle against racism without seeking to change
those institutions which foster racism and without building institu-
tions which advance racial equality. ’

However substantial the mass movement may become, however
militant and determined, it will not ultimately achieve its aims unless
it addresses itself to the problems of

1) a ﬁrm alliance with the labor movement

2) political realignment in the United States.

Certainly this is not to place ultimata or ﬁnal choices before the
movement. Today the building of a heightened and broader mass
action movement must be the primary task. Without it we can look
forward only to a relapse into gradualism in one shape or another.
But, though it may not be at once apparent, the very logic of the
movement will lead to a transformation of economic and political
structures in the United States.

What follows is a brief exposition of the kind of political reorgani-
zation that must ultimately occur. I emphasize ultimately for those
who argue that such a development is not now within sight. While
they are correct, any analysis that hopes to be basic is obligated to
discuss not only immediate and concrete developments but long-
range direction as well.

Independent Poliﬁcs

WHEN WE SPEAK of reconstructing American politics, we inevitably
come back to the labor movement. While essentially Negro organiza-
tions and institutions are leading the current movement for equality
they are not in themselves capable of bringing about fundamental
change. They can spark the process or start the ball rolling. But as a
minority group in the United States, Negroes ﬁnally mustrelate
themselves to an organized majority force which objectively seeks
the same ends they seek. That is to say, they cannot at apoint be

39-

merely a pressure group but must be an integral part of a broader
social movement which can reorganize majority institutions. Chief
among the forces that can play such a role is the labor movement.

just as formerly labor paved the wa.y for a big advance for the
Negro, today it is the Negro who paves the way for labor.

If some of the stuff of social idealism seems to have passed out of
the labor movement, it is ascendant in the Negro movement. The
Negro and his children have marched to Washington in the tens of
thousands. They have marched on state capitals, organized mass
petition campaigns, and held gigantic protest rallies. Not only have
these activities had a mass base, but they have also been politically
independent. They are organized outside of the political machines of
both parties, thereby underlining the unsuitability of both parties as
organs representative of the Negro people.

The Washington demonstrations were not non-political. They were
political in the profoundest sense. However, they were non-partisan:
non-partisan in part to avoid engagement in petty politics; non-par-
tisan, more importantly, because alignment with either the Demo-
cratic or Republican parties would assume that one of them is really
capable of taking up the political cudgel for the Negroes. As these
parties are now structured, who could take responsibility for such an
assumption? ‘ ’

Unfortunately, there is an unhappy answer to this rhetorical ques-
tion: the labor movement. It still believes it can effectively pursue its
interests within the present framework of the Democratic Party,
despite the constant ﬂow of betrayals. The passage of the outrageous
Landrum-Griﬂin bill by a Congress in control of the Democratic
Party has opened the eyes of many trade unionists to the futility of
placing Labor’s political life in the hands of that Party. Some have
abandoned this illusion only to acquire anotheri that the correct course
consists in supporting “liberal” Republicans as well as “liberal”
Democrats, disregarding political aﬂiliation.

Sections of the Negro leadership are also tied to the Democratic
Party, especially in the NAACP, locals of which have attached them-
selves to the Party machines, which are anti-democratic in structure
and corrupt in content. Among the Negro leaders also the abandon-
ment of the one illusion has been followed by the acquisition of the
new one with regard to the Republican liberals.

Support of liberal Republicans is, to an extent, a progressive step
in that it weakens all-out commitment to the Democratic Party. But
this policy too presents serious problems in view of the control
exercised over the Republican Party by the Big Business cliques which
have stakes in the maintenance of the cheap labor market.

Moreover, all that such a policy can accbmplish is a slight incre-
ment in the weight of liberal elements in Congress. 'But these elements

40

 

 

are still responsible, to one degree or another, to their respective
national apparatuses, apparatuses still dominated by anti-democratic
forces. The labor and Negro movements cannot be rep-resented by
such an amorphous body of liberals who are insufficiently commited
to their ideals to organize under their own banner and who are
bound to their reactionary colleagues by that intricate network of
obligations and log-rolling along which compromises and sellouts roll.
The Negro and labor movements and progressive elements generally
must be represented by an organized political party committed to
them and responsible only to them.

For Political Realignment in the U.$.

THE NUCLEAR AGE indeed raises new questions as to the forms of
political organization adapted to its needs, and it may well be that
future organization will bear little resemblance to those forms with
which we have been familiar in this country. This does not alter the
fact that the immediate step for the Negro, labor and other forces
under discussion is developing a political party that is responsible
to them. It makes no sense for these forces simply to withdraw sup-
port from the two major political p-arties. In a presidential election
in which the choice is often between tweedle—dum and tweedle-dee,
abstentionism can hardly be dismissed as a purely crackpot tactic. But
here we must differentiate between electoral abstentionism, which the
absence of real choice makes understandable, and political absten-
tionism, that is, a withdrawal from politics in its larger sense. Political
abstentionism is not a basically valid or viable strategy for a social
group, especially in 20th Century America. Having found it impossible
in good conscience to vote for either tweedle-dum or tweedle-dum, we
are at least obliged to work toward the development of an alternative.

If the Negro needs an organized, cohesive national instrument to
serve as the vehicle for the realization of his aspirations, what char-
acter should this instrument have?

Preparatory to answering these questions, let us recapitulate a
number of points made earlier in the discussion.

We have seen that racial prejudice and segregation are not merely

\ problems of intellect and education, but have functions in American

society, functions serving the interests of minority ruling groups. In
the South segregation and disfranchisement are the bases of political
rule; and for Big Business, the economic and political suppression
of the Negro serves to maintain a cheap labor market and a lucrative
status quo. From this is not to be inferred that everyone having racial
prejudice is either a Southern politician or corporation head. Preju-
dices take on an independence and tradition of their own and must
be combatted ideologically; at the same time the sources of Jim Crow
must be leveled if the disease springing from them is to be destroyed.

41

Therefore it is clear that the ﬁght for civil rights cannot be limited
to one or two spheres. A ﬁght for the end of segregation in schools
necessarily becomes involved with the ﬁght for democracy itself (as
in the defense of the NAACP against outlawing in Southern states),
and thus with the nature of political rule in the South—with the
whole Southern system. A further example: what happens in Southern
cities‘when a Negro child who has experienced integrated education
graduates? A return to the ghetto after a youthful ﬂing with equality?
It is obvious that such a situation could have profound effects on
the child subjected to it. Real educational integration can” become
meaningful only with integration in all other spheres of life, par-
ticularly housing and employment. In other words, the ﬁght of the
Negro cannot

1) be conﬁned to working through the courts, but must put pressure
on all agencies of government;

2) be restricted to the achievement of equality only in education
or only in this or that area of life: his demand must be for full
economic, political and social equality.

Finally, we have noted that despite all of its faults and short-
sightedness, the labor movement has been the major white ally of the
Negro in his struggle, and has, because of its very social nature, goals
and interests parallel to those of the Negro. Indeed, though the wedge
of racial prejudice may unfortunately come between the Negro and
white worker, their common welfare transcends the color line, which
has been dimming with the growth of unionism. In addition, because
their interests are parallel, the Negro and labor movements have
both been attacked and frustrated by the same enemy: the coalition
ofconservative Republicans and Southern Democrats.

Getting back to the question we asked before this summary . . .

Eighteen million people now belong to the organized trade union
movement. There are, in addition, 18 million Negroes in the United
States. Add to this the millions of small farmers constantly struggling
to keep up mortgage payments; the hundreds of thousands of migrant
farm workers; millions of workers who are not yet part of the
organized labor movement but who share its interests; members of
other exploited minority groups; real liberals and democrats from
professional groups and other areas of life. Here we have the makings
of a great new democratic party in the United States, a party of labor,
liberals and farmers, a party representing a vast majority of the
American people. ‘

We are not proposing a “third party” or any sort of splinter group.
What we do propose is the creation of a real second party in the
United States. Under our present party alignment a voter has no
real choice, no opportunity to choose between alternate approaches
to the great problems facing the United States and the rest of the

42

 

 

world. A voter at present may “choose” a Democrat or a Republican,
either or both of whom may _be liberal or conservative in their per-
sonal political outlooks. No matter which one is elected to Congress
the general result is the same: a Congress ruled by a coalition of
conservative Republicans and Southern Dixiecrats. Such a coalition
has fairly consistently ruled the United States since 1938. During
this period there has been no real progress made in the direction of
social welfare, progressive labor legislation, civil rights legislation.
In 1958, for example, a much larger number of liberal Democrats
were elected to Congress than in many years. The Democratic Party
was presented with huge working majorities in both houses. In many
areas anti-labor politicians running on “right-to-work” platforms were
overwhelmingly defeated. A great resurgence of liberalism was seen
by many observers. V

What in fact was the result of this “liberal resurgence?” The new
Congress in its ﬁrst session passed the Landrum-Griﬂin Bill which was
far more concerned with placing further limitations on the legitimate
functioning of trade unions than with establishing democracy in
corrupt unions. The Congress in its ﬁrst session also failed to pass
any civil rights legislation whatsoever. Even in its ﬁnal session the
civil rights bill it passed was hardly worthy of the name. This was
the result of the votes of those millions who thought they were voting
for liberalism. No wonder then that American politics has become
a farce in the minds of many. It will remain so as long as there is
no party that really endorses, and will carry out, a program of liberal
reform, civil rights legislation and support to the most democratic
and progressive sections of the labor movement.

Should we conclude that the Democratic and Republican parties
are exactly the same and that we should have the same attitude toward
both? It is true that neither of them really delivers on its promises
to the people, that neither attempts to carry out what is often clearly
the popular will. These parties do differ in one decisive respect. The
Democratic Party contains within it the great democratic forces in
America, labor, Negroes in the North, liberals, small farmers. It is
generally supported by the natural majority of the American people.
It contains most of those elements that are needed to form a great new
party. At the same time, however, it contains the worst enemies of
these forces: the Southern Dixiecrats and the corrupt Northern ma-
chines. We must pay great attention to the tensions that exist between
the liberal-labor wing and the reactionary elements in the Democratic
Party. These tensions are the dynamic potential for political realign-
ment in America.

At this point no one can predict the exact outcome of such a strug-
gle. Some expect the Dixiecrats to be forced out and the machine
eventually destroyed while others feel that the reactionary elements

UNFINISHED  
  REVOLUTION

by TOM KAHN

A revolution is unfurling—America’s unﬁnished revolution. It is unfurling in lunch"

counters, buses, libraries and schools—wherever the dignity and potential of man
are denied. Youth and idealism are unfurling. Masses of Negroes are marching onto
the stage of history and demanding their freedom now! —A. PHILIP RANDOLPH

NEW YORK - 1960

 

will cling to the name and structure of the Democratic Party while
the liberal-labor forces will have to adopt a new name. No matter
which way the struggle leads, its result will be a split in the Democratic
Party and the formation of a new party. This new party may still
have the name Democratic Party but it will be recognizable by its
real commitment to the progressive -forces in the United States and
by the fact that it is itself responsive and responsible to these forces.

The Democratic Party has for a long time encompassed the extremes
of American politics. With the increasing involvement of the labor
movement in the politics of the Democratic Party the struggle ‘between
its two wings will continue to increase in intensity. .If labor is not yet
willing to take seriously Vvalter Reuther’s statement that the Demo-
cratic Party can’t have him and Senator Eastland at the same time, if
even Reuther himself is not yet prepared to put deeds behind his
words, then it is the duty of everyone seriously concerned with progress
in the United States to bring every possible pressure to bear on sharp-
ening the struggle within the Democratic Party.

With labor and most liberals not yet ready to transform their sense of
political frustration into decisive action, the civil rights movement re-
mains the great catalytic agent in the process of political realignment.

The Negro is a catalyst in American politics precisely because, di-
rectly or indirectly, he challenges the liberal. Liberals must be force-
fully made to understand that compromise can no longer be endured,
that this ﬁght for full civil rights now must be pushed to the hilt in
the Democratic Party and that this ﬁght -may no longer be sub-
ordinated to considerations of party unity. We know from experience
that the choice must be made between the Negro’s rights and party
unity. We believe the two are mutually incompatible. The liberal
disagrees. But he has not made the test—he must be called upon to
do so now.

If others have not been educated to the role of the Southern Democ-
rats in blocking federal aid to education, expanded old-age assistance,
increased minimum wage laws, and improved social security beneﬁts-
if others do not know what the power of Eastland means in their
own lives—the Negro needs no educating. He knows Eastland well
enough and is not quite sure what a Humphrey is doing in the same
party with him. Is this because the Negro is a purist, or a political
moralist? No more so than anyone else. It’s just that political morality
is right now an absolute concrete necessity for the Negro. For him,
political immorality is measurable in poverty, humiliation, self-
degradation and blood! As long as liberals in the Senate continue to
elect Dixiecrats like Eastland to important committee chairmanships
and men like Johnson to the position of Majority Leader, Negroes
will continue to aggravate the conﬂicts between the labor-liberal
forces and the reactionaries within the Democratic Party.

The Program of file New Parfy

A LIBERAL-LABOR PARTY would run candidates committed to the ﬁght
of the Negro for equality, of the workingman for improved living
conditions, of the farmer for the fair share of his produce. They would
be committed to these forces not because of altruistic or idealistic
motives simply, but because they depend upon their sup-port in the
way candidates now depend on the support of the machines.

A liberal-labor party could undertake a mobilization of the South-
ern Negro in a ﬁght for the ballot that would mean nothing less than
a political revolution in the South. The present Democratic Party
cannot do this, however noble the intentions of some of its more
liberal components, since this would mean the destruction of that
Party’s machinery in the South. The Republican Party cannot do this
because it would be a step toward unionization of the Southern
Negro, accompanied by a rise in his wages. A party responsive to labor
can and must do this because, second to the Negro, the labor move-
ment stands most to gain from the destruction of the Southern po-
litical machine and because it cannot guarantee the wages and job
security of its own members so long as the Negro is outside of the
trade union movement. And the unionization of the South cannot be
accomplished in the context of Jim Crow dominance, of the poll tax,
of lynching. It cannot be done by support of the present forces which
represent the South politically. It cannot be done in conjunction with
the extremely reactionary attitudes of Northern heavy industry, power
companies and insurance companies which function in the South like
colonial administrators.

A liberal-labor party would confront the voter with real choices. It
would not have to take responsibility for an Eastland or Faubus or
]ohnson—or a Landrum or Griﬂin. In those areas where trade unionists
play dominant roles in the Democratic Party, the local parties have
fought vigorously against discrimination and segregation in schools,
housing, employment, etc.

Could such a party win? We believe it could not only win, but
could consistently be the majority party in the United States. It would
include many of the liberal elements that have already made their
presence felt in national politics, and would bring into existence an
entirely new conﬁguration of Southern politics. The enfranchisement
of the 6,000,000 potential Negro voters in the South would transform
minority rule into majority rule.

The formation of a labor party, in and of itself, does not guarantee
the Negro an abrupt end to his suffering and humiliation. Nor does
it mean a complete overnight realization of all democratic ideals. The
scars left on society by a decaying order, in the form of ugly tradi-
tions, bigoted and narrow thought patterns and prejudiced behavior,
run deep. Furthermore, racism undoubtedly has psychological roots

45

 

\

which did not grow directly out of economic or political structures
and require a therapy for which the way is opened by alteration in
these structures. No one knows better than the Negro the disillusion-
ment that trails the belief that any single development automatically
leads to total» liberation from the thousands of great and minute
aifronts he daily endures. To encourage him in this belief is dishonest
and he knows it from experience. Further, as radicals, we are com-
mitted not only to the formation of a labor party, but to deep-er
transformations in the economic, political, social and cultural life of
America. T

Nonetheless, if the formation of a labor party does not in and of
itself guarantee the realization of our democratic ideals, of total Negro
freedom, it could be a gigantic step in the right direction. It will be
the most promising beginning made in decades, for from the start it
will represent a frontal attack on the social institutions upon which
race hate feeds—and this is the job- to be done now! This is the job the
two major parties have not tackled and will not. It represents the
extension of the Negroes’ ﬁght into all spheres—e-conomic, political
and social——on a national, organized scale.

The new party will have problems. They are not to be made light
of. It will be beset by internal as well as external difﬁculties. It will
be attacked by reactionaries outside and will be plagued by some
corrupt and opportunist elements on the inside. Like the trade union
movement today, unable because of its wide democratic base to conceal
corruption very long (unlike management which, having to account
to no one but itself, can keep a lid on its own corruption), a labor
party will be vulnerable to smears. But it will be a far healthier party
than the two now existing. It will be an inﬁnitely more democratic
party, based not on machines and bosses, but on the great mass of
working men and women, Negro and white.

V. WHAT NEXT?

THE PREVIOUS PAGES have pointed out the need for political realign-
ment. In virtually all democratic countries, except the United States,
far-reaching freedom movements have in this century eventually found
organized political expression. Throughout the Western world mass
labor, liberal and democratic—radical p-arties have grown up with
relatively consistent democratic programs. Only in the United States

douliberals cohabit with reactionaries in the same parties.

Here it is necessary to observe that in this essay we are omitting

‘any discussion of the problems of international relations and nuclear

war, which by common consent is the most important and pressing
problem before all mankind. If the race does not survive, all its prob-
lems become irrelevant. A party which trulygserved the interest of
the Negro people might well make a major contribution to world
peace, but this is not automatically guaranteed. It would happen only
if such a party dealt intelligently with the whole range of interna-
tional problems and nuclear war. If it failed to do that, it is conceiv-
able that a very substantial political realignment might take place in
this country which would contribute to a radical improvement in the
status  the Negro people but which would be committed to a false
and dangerous military and foreign policy. The fact that we do not
deal more fully with such issues here should not be taken to mean
that we underestimate their importance or are unaware of how integ-
rally they are related to the struggle of the Negro people. Nor should
the discussion of the possible imperfections and inadequacies of the
kind of new party we are talking ab-out dampen the urgency for such
a party to be organized. A new liberal-labor party, if it is to be broad,
and reﬂective of the widest segment of genuine democratic opinion,
will inevitably be imperfect. But, more important, it can provide the

breakthrough this country so sorely needs, and create a new frame-

work within which uncompromising democrats can work.

Over the years people have been debating the idea of political
realignment as put forth earlier. There never seemed to be a handle
or lever to grasp in the situation, or a force to propel politics in this
new direction. Now, however, the debate is not raised in- a vacuum.
The civil rights movement has moved ahead and into advanced forms
of action,‘c'reating new alignments of forces and a new moral and
political atmosphere.

We are concerned not only with the forwarding of civil rights,
but also with creating an atmosphere in which a genuine attempt to
deal with basic problems can begin. Hence it is the responsibility of
all people interested in the civil rights movement to be conscious of

47

 

-. . .. -r.—N~:.~.-an-4: .-.::: =—.——,——-.—-—,-.-~.~.::,4-1::-; 44p>~4 .

the contribution it can make to American society as a whole; and,
conversely, those who are truly concerned with American democracy
as a whole must recognize their responsibility toward the building
of the mass movement for Negro freedom. In the course of the Negro
struggle in the South, certain concepts of organization and action
have emerged. These concepts conﬁgure the unique character of the
movement and lay the foundations for its growth. In summarizing
them below we are by no means seeking to impose “outside” standards
on the Southern movement. We are not even introducing these stand-
ards; they have evolved out of the very concrete situation in which
the Southern Negro masses ﬁnd themselves. What we do say, however,
from our vantage point and with whatever experience we can bring
to bear, is that these concepts and standards must become deeply
rooted in the movement, that they must grow and win general ac-
ceptance, as minimum requirements.

Necessary Requirements

1) The movement must be built primarily on direct action by
masses of Negroes in the South. Northern Negroes must play a part,
but at present the fact that they are more widely scattered and that
their condition is not so desperate as that of Southern Negroes means
they cannot so easily reach group unity or realize the potential of
their political power. On the other hand, Negroes in the South, lack-
ing any real organized political and economic power, must use the
weight of their collective bodies, the power of withdrawing their col-
lective trade, as a substitute for the more conventional methods to
challenge the old order.

Furthermore, the broader the direct action movement, the more
white Southerners will be forced to take a stand. Prior to the Mont-
gomery Bus Protest, for example, most white Southern liberals
refused even to declare themselves on integration. However, the Bus
Protest, the fact that 50,000 Negroes walked for over a year in one
city, forced a few white liberals all over the South to speak out. When
the student sit-ins swept the South, city after city, state after state,
more and more white people were increasingly involved. Some South-
ern newspapers wrote sympathetic editorials, church groups spoke
out, Southern labor unions contributed and a limited number of
white people joined the picket lines. A few joined the protest itself
and were arrested.

As the direct action struggle continues and broadens to include
more and more fundamental issues, it will by its own very dynamic
draw more and more whites into the civil rights movement.

2) The movement must avoid getting bogged down in legal [aro-
ceedings. Southern white supremacists are prepared and able to take
the initiative in such proceedings in courts which they control and

48

 

 

l\’lart:h 6, M(mlg'omery: Negro churclt vs. State (lapitol.

consequently where victories are preordained—espe(:ially in the lower
state courts. Beyond this, t;he 1)lXlt.‘(i1‘::1t political leaders have evolved
a new strategy based on such civil suits  tax evasion, libel, and
slander. These will be used to slow down the militant civil rights
leaders by involving them in rear guard action that consumes their
time and energy and the rnovernent’s money. Tllese leaders must fight
such cases in the courts. On the other hand, this is all the more reason
that hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional funds must not
be spent for legal cases when people are arrested because they have
taken the initiative against segregation laws and local custoins. In
such cases the leadership’s response must be to get on with mmtnunity
organization (mobilization of masses in the community against seg-A
regated institutions) and should consider whether their slogan should
not be that advanced by the movements of Gandhi and Nkrumah:
“No Bail, No Fines, No Defense—Fill the Jails!”

3) The leadership of the movement must make a total personal
revolutionary commitment. The Southern leadership has already
denionstrated its courage and dedication, but inasmuch as it is usher-

49

ing in social change, it must have other characteristics as well. It
cannot be middle-class in its attitudes, but must broaden the social
concepts of the Negro in the struggle. It cannot be attached to the
general materialistic objectives of this society (or share prevalent atti-
tudes toward property) lest the Southern racists wrap them up in civil
suits. In the narrower sense, the Negro leader who is overly concerned
about keeping his house or car places a new weapon of intimidation
in the hands of the supremacist regime; in the broader sense, that
Negro leader cannot mobilize direct action against Woolworth’s with-
out abandoning middle-class concepts of the sanctity of private prop-
erty. This is one of the respects in which the Negro leader is
ineluctably a revolutionary.

The leadership must also avoid political opportunism. Because of
the very nature of this society, strong temptations will arise to play
along with the existing political machines. Early in the game, the
Negro leadership must wage an educational campaign relating the
struggle to basic needs for social change. It cannot afford to be
parochial, to see itself in limited regional or racial terms, but must
interpret the necessity for sound alliances on a wide range of issues.

4) The mass character of the movement must spread to the North.
The most fundamental way in which Northerners can help the South-
ern movementis not simply by picketing Woolworth’s or conducting
economic boycotts—which are indeed worthwhile—but by extending
non-Violent mass action here against housing and employment dis-
crimination. Imagine the effect on the whole movement if Negroes in
Chicago’s south side ghetto or New York’s Harlem organized a rent
strike until the real estate lobby was brought to its knees!

5) The substance of the movement is day-to-day involvement. What
made Montgomery a success was that every Negro in the city had
a job to do. If he rode the buses, he would henceforth walk. If he
owned a car, he would pool it with others. If he was religious, he
could organize church members for mass meetings, and so on. Thus,
as we stated before, the movement must be broad enough to give
everyone a part. And this means that in each community a variety of
actions must be planned.

Here again, imagine the repercussions, the dynamic that would be
injected into the movement, if on a day-to-day basis Negroes across
the country took upon themselves the single concrete task of staying
out of Woolworth’s!

6) The immediate objective now must be to get the vote! While
recognizing the importance of a mass action program for the North,
we must not lose sight of the fact that the crucial struggle for freedom
today centers in the South. And in that struggle the central task is
the winning of the vote.

We need not repeat here what we have already stated about the

50

importance of the voting crusade. In a sense, this entire pamphlet
has been an elaboration of ‘the possibilities and implications of the
ballot revolution. The author knows of no more dramatic’ and force-
ful summary of these possibilities than the words of Martin Luther
King spoken at the Lincoln Memorial before 17,000 participants in
the Prayer Pilgrimage to Washington:

Give Us ﬁle Ballot!
“GIVE US THE BALLOT and we will no longer have to worry the federal
government about our basic rights.

“Give us the ballot andiwe will no longer plead to the federal
government for the passage of an anti-lynching law. We will by the
power of our vote write the law on the statute books of the South
and bring an end to the dastardly acts of the hooded perpetrators
of violence. I

“Give us the ballot and we will transform the salient misdeeds of
bloodthirsty mobs into the calculated good deeds of orderly citizens.

“Give us the ballot and we will ﬁll our legislative halls with men
of good will and send to the sacred halls of Congress men who will
not sign a Southern Manifesto because of their devotion to the
manifesto of justice.

“Give us the ballot and we will place judges on the benches of the
South who will do justly and love mercy. And we will place at the
head of the Southern states governors who have felt not only the
tang of the human but the glory of the divine.

“Give us the ballot and we will quietly and non-violently, without
rancor or bitterness, implement the Supreme Court decision of May
17, 1954.

“Give us the ballot and we will help bring to this nation a new
society based on justice and dedicated to peace.”

This is the challenge of the century. This is the promise of a new
quality of life in America. Today the Negro is in the forefront of
this struggle for new politics in our nation. He is even now preparing
his challenge to the Democratic and Republican parties. He is already
declaring himself to the labor movement. His white brothers are

‘sluggish and hesitant. They are unsure: perhaps next time. But the

Negro is impatient. He has had enough and» wants to move now!
This is his contribution to democracy.

51

Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen. . . .

APPENDIX: THE HISTORY OF JIM CROW

The first observation to be made in examining race relations in the South
is that Jim Crow is a relatively recent phenomenon. In fact, the greater part
of racial segregation was unborn until the last quarter of the last century. Here
we must differentiate between segregation—that is, forced physical separation
of the races by la.w—and the doctrine of white supremacy, since the latter
considerably predates the former. In one form or another the belief in innate
Negro inferiority has been a strain in vitrually all previous relations between
the races, owing to the fact that u11der virtually all previous relations the
Negro was subordinated by whites; and ruling races, like ruling classes, must
have an ideological defense to justify their exploitation. But it is also true
that such ideologies may remain largely unexpressed and unelaborated until
they are challenged. So it was with the. doctrine of white supremacy in
America; not until the slavocracy was challenged, on the moral level by the
abolitionists and on the political-economic level by the rising Northern
capitalism, did this doctrine become clearly deﬁned and solidiﬁed.

The Anfebellum Soufh
If, as the 19th century wore on, the plantation system increasingly required
legal and religious grounding in white supremacy. it still had no need of

5°

 

racial segregation.’As  Vann I/Voodward points out (The Strange Career of
Jim Crow): “In so far as the Negro’s status was ﬁxed and proclaimed by
enslavement there was no need or occasion to resort to segregation to estab-
lish his caste and subordination.” Moreover, “. . . There were many aspects
of plantation slavery that promoted intimacy between the races and rendered
segregation impracticable. The supervision, care, exploitation and policing
of slaves necessitated many contacts and accustomed the races in the South
to a degree of intimacy unequaled in other parts of the country. . . .”

Another basic factor militated against the rise of a rigid racial estrange-
ment in the South, which remained in a frontier stage most of its antebellum
history: the sparseness of population and the rural isolation of the plantation
unit necessitated a relatively unrestricted social intermingling.

Althoughvviolence, always present in a frontier situation, was a hallmark
of Southern life, and the South had become the “home of lynching,” this
violence was not directed speciﬁcally against the Negro. Of more than 300
persons said to have been hanged or burned by mobs between 1840 and
1860, less than 10% were Negroes. As one writer (W. J. Cash, The Mind of
the South) observes, “So long as the Negro had been property, worth from
$500 up, he had been taboo—safer from rope and faggot than any common
white man, and perhaps even safer than his master himself.” (Contrast the
reported ﬁgure of approximately 30 Negroes lynched between 1840-1860 to
the number lynched between 1890-99: 1,1111 The total in the 56 year period
1882-1938 was 3,397!)

Also to be contrasted against current Southern mores is the attitude then
prevalent toward miscegenation, that is, racial interbreeding. “Efforts to build
up a taboo against miscegenation,” Cash reports, “made little real progress.”
In his The American Negro, Professor Melville I-Ierskovits points out that
“Instead of 80% or 85% of the American Negroes being wholly of African
descent, only a little over 20% are unmixed, while almost 80% show mixture
with white or American Indian.” And all evidence indicates that this state
of affairs had already been reached by 1860. Nor is it to be thought that
the mulatto arose as the result only of union between the Negro and “white
trash.” That the plantation owner indulged in frequent interracial sexual
adventures is documented as vividly in Southern ﬁction as in sociological
studies.

What conclusion do we draw from this run-down on race relations in the
antebellum South? Certainly not that the Negro was better off under slavery,
(unless we accept the limited criterion of segregation). It must be emphasized
that ‘Negro life in the antebellum South was by no means the idyllic scene
painted by many Southern historians and romanticists. The very nature of
the work on the plantations, of forced labor itself, was .a cruel oppression
against which many thousands of Negroes, with the help of sympathetic
whites, continually rebelled. (Accounts of the Underground Railway pro-
vide dramatic illustration of the discontent and misery among the slaves.)

Further, the legend of racial harmony in slavery times has no basis in
fact. If Southern whites speak fondly of having been suckled by Negro
“mammies,” we should at least’ remember that few slaves were “mammies”—
the great bulk of Negroes worked in the ﬁelds, not as household servants,
and in the ﬁelds the white master ruled with the whip. And the plantation
experience has not yet been washed out of the American Negro. In its effects
on his personality, family structure, social life and organization, slavery
erased the African experience and imprinted upon him the caste-stamp of
the South.

We make no concession to racist genetics when we recognize certain social

This pamphlet is not an individual, but really a collective, effort. While its
formulations are solely the responsibility of the author, it represents in
essence the congealed thinking of a number of people who have over the
years applied themselves to basic analysis of the civil rights movement.

I want to thank A. J. Muste, who has permitted me to draw upon his
thinking and writings for much of the material dealing with non-violence.
I want also to acknowledge the attention and encouragement given this work
by Dan Wakeﬁeld and Roy Finch, who examined the manuscript and who
offered valuable suggestions. For technical assistance I thank Igal Roodenko
and Douglas Gorsline. For editorial assistance and all-around helpfulness,
I am indebted to Michael Harrington, Jack Stuart, Rachelle Horowitz and
Joan Suall. For much of the historical and factual material contained in
these pages I thank Dr. George Rawick of the University of Chicago and
Martin Oppenheimer of the University of Pennsylvania.

Finally, I want to acknowledge——and in a sense dedicate this pamphlet
to—the inspiration of Bayard Rustin. He has seen in his own lifetime the
partial emergence of the kind of movement he has fought for with a vigor
and skill matched by few, if any, individuals in the civiljrights ﬁeld. He will
doubtless be embarrassed by my contention that no other individual has
called the shots so straight as he. I take note, then, of his embarrassment,
but proceed to observe that no one person more deserves the ear of the
Negro community than he. In any case, this pamphlet is dedicated to the
contemporary non-violent mass. movement which Bayard Rustin and other
pioneers, honored though unknown, helped to generate with no small sac-
riﬁce to themselves. If we know nothing else, we know that the Negro’s
revolt sprang from the seeds of many whose lives were destroyed by the
lynch-rope or rededicated on the chain-gang. To such “criminals” we owe
a debt of immeasurable gratitude. In such “criminals” lies the hope of a new
America. To such “criminals” do oppressed people the world over look for
the freedom and equality granted by our ideals but unrealized in our deeds.

and cultural characteristics peculiar to the American Negro. These character-
istics are the product of an historical environment. That they are being
gradually outgrown explodes the myth that they are genetically determined.
We are told that the Negro is lazy. The stereotype is based largely on the
portrait of the Negro slave. What the racists neglect to add is that slavery
has induced a kind of indolence among all people who have ‘been subjected
to it, since servitude, though it exacts labor, cannot stimulate personal in-
dustry. Precisely because slavery has been the lot of the Negro as a race in
this country, characteristics common to all enslaved people appear peculiar
to the Negro.

If it is also true that Negroes long lacked effective leadership, this is
because the whip does not encourage initiative. If in Negro families today
the father is often a weak ﬁgure, this is because, for one thing, he had under
slavery no family over which to preside, and for another, the mother was
better able to avoid the total humiliation and disintegration that fell to the
male ﬁeld slave. (Related to this is the fact that chronic unemployment
weakens the position of the father in any group.)"“ The inferiority complex
of the Negro lingers on and is buttressed by modern racism. All in all, the
Old South’s distortion of the Negro personality and psychology was im-
measurably deep and scarring.

No, we cannot conclude that the Negro was better off under slavery. But
we do conclude——indeed, it is not a conclusion but a fact——that the huge
fabric of racial segregation, all pervasive and intricately designed to cover
the remotest racial contact points, codiﬁed and reinforced by law and lynch-
rope—this did not come into being until the last years of the 1880's. Only
80 years ago! All that the racists have so long been bellowing about the
absolute inherent incompatibility of the races is false. Upon examination, it
turns out that segregation of the races is not a matter of divine design, but
is an historical development: it came about in a speciﬁc determinable period
of time as the result of specific economic, social and political forces in 19th
century America. Segregation and discrimination continue to exist largely
because the outmoded patterns built into American life by these forces
continue to exist.

If many of the pertinent facts about race relations in the antebellum South
are concealed by the racists in order to maintain that segregation is super-
historical and the divinely inspired natural order of things, these facts are
also often ignored by liberals. For, if you believe that the source of racial
tension is simply in what people traditionally “think” and “feel” how can
you explain the transformation in the thinking and feeling of the white
Southerner in regard to the Negro in the comparatively short time, say,
between the years 1840-1870? How are thinking and feeling determined-
and changed? If prejudice is the product of segregation and segregation is
the product of prejudice—and you have nothing more to say about it—how
is the cycle to be broken?

The Rise of Jim Crow
The view has gained currency that racial segregation in the South was a
vengeful reaction to the harshness of Reconstruction. Actually, the massive
segregation campaigns did not begin until ten years after the end of Re-
* After the Emancipation Proclamation, Negro women were often the sole
breadwinners in the family, since it was easier for them to get work as
domestics than for their husbands. It should be noted here too, that more
Negro women worked than did white.

construction. That the period immediately following Reconstruction was
marked by race conflict and violence is true. But before this conﬂict could
take the path of total segregation, disfranchisement and ostracism, some-
thing else had to happen—and did: the withdrawal and collapse of restrain-
ing non-racist forces in both the North and South.

The outstanding signal of this collapse was, of course, the Compromise
of 1877 marking the formal end of Reconstruction. The mechanics of the
largely secret Compromise boil.ed down to this: In return for conceding the
election of Hays to the Republicans (although Tilden had the majority of
the popular vote, and undoubtedly should have received the majority of
the electoral vote), the Southern Democrats extracted the promise that federal
troops would be withdrawn from the South and the two remaining Repub-
lican governments in Louisiana and South Carolina would be abandoned.
This deal, notable in American history as a high point in disregard of the
democratic process, still was not the climax of indifference to the Southern
Negro. Much had developed before the deal could have taken place, and
much of the course of national politics was adumbrated by it.

At the end of the Civil War, the Democratic Party in the South had come
to be more and more under the domination of the old Whigs. Never satisﬁed
with membership in the Democratic Party (into which they had been forced
by the pressures of the anti~Republicanism of the Civil War), the Whigs
were in the main the business-oriented, commercially-minded elements in
the South. By and large, as Van Woodward points out, “they supported
Henry Clay’s nationalistic and capitalistic program of a protective tariff
and a national bank.” Conservative and class-conscious, the Whigs identiﬁed
more with the representatives of expanding Northern industry than with
their poor white brothers in the South. They tended to shrink from the
anti-Negro violence of the racists and emphasized class distinctions as op-
posed to race distinctions.

The economic ties of the Whigs to the Northern Republicans is a key
factor in explaining the Compromise of 1877. Both groups shared in com-
mon the desire to avert the chaos and bloodshed which seemed promised by
the Hays-Tilden jam-up. (In many Southern cities small armies were being
organized to march on Washington and forcibly install Tilden.) Not only
did the \/Vhigs see the gathering storm as a threat to the business enterprises
they had been building up since the war, but they also had cause to clash

increasingly with their fellow Democrats in the North. Largely in reaction‘

against the business scandals that rocked the Grant administration, the
Democratic House Appropriations Committee adopted a tight money policy
and killed federal funds for “improvements” and public works programs in
the South. This same Committee, by the way, had announced its intention
of cutting off funds for the maintenance of troops in the South, so that Hays
would, as he knew, have had to withdraw them in any case. Thus, the
removal of federal troops could not have been the main goal of the South
in the Compromise. Essential to the Compromise of 1877 were the promises
of investment capital that the V/Vhigs elicited from the Republicans.

Although the removal of federal troops from the South stripped the
Negro of protection against violence, it by no means resulted immediately
in segregation and disfranchisement. More than twenty years would pass
before the Negro would ﬁnally be placed under a full-ﬂedged Jim Crow
system.

The new alliances that brought about the Compromise of 1877 would need
time to mature before their full impact would be felt. So far only Northern
liberalism had abandoned the Negro. For reasons we shall go into later,

55

this abandonment conﬁgured the ﬁnal collapse of the restraining, non-racists
forces which made way for Jim Crow. First, it is necessary to examine politics
in the South itself.

So completely is the one-party system of the South accepted today, that it
is easy to forget that Democratic rule did not always prevail unchallenged
there. Van Woodward reminds us of the time when “a Southerner was no
more presumed to be a member of a particular party than was a Northerner.
In fact such a presumption was rather more risky in the case of the South-
erner than in the case of the citizens of certain other regions. For the
antebellum South, particularly during the 1830’s and l840’s, divided over
pretty much the same questions that divided other sections politically. And
the South, moreover, divided closely, with no more than a narrow margin
for the victor, and victory never a sure thing for either of the major parties."
(Reunion and Reaction.) ~

Political conflict in the South was, following the general rule, a reﬂection
of class conﬂict. At ﬁrst, this coriﬂict was slow to sharpen in the South. Even
after the invention of the cotton gin and the consequent relegation of the
poor whites to infertile lands, the social mobility associated with frontier
life dulled consciousness of social distinction.

But somewhat before the Civil War, as the big plantations grew bigger,
their slave holdings multiplying, and small trading towns grew into large
commercial centers for the sale of cotton, class antagonisms did develop.
Before the war they were still embryonic, vague stirrings, unorganized and
for the most part undeﬁned. (Here the fact should be noted, though not
overworked, that there are recorded numerous incidents of poor whites aid-
ing and helping to organize slave revolts during the decade 1850-60, when
slave escapes ran particularly high.) r

The effect of the Civil War, in ruining the South economically through
the abolition of slavery and the imposition of excessive tax burdens, was
to tend to level out these growing class feelings. Class loyalties were sub-
ordinated to race loyalty as the white Southern brotherhood joined hands
to ﬁght Yankeedom. In place of the plantation owner, the free Negro now
stood in the eyes of the poor whites as the enemy. Even in the earliest
periods of incipient social stratiﬁcation, the poor white, at the bottom rung
of the economic ladder, began to regard the Negro as inferior in order to
avoid the conclusion that he was himself the lowest of the low in society.
The ideology of white supremacy, which had grown now into a consolidated
doctrine, provided the poor white with a psychological mechanism through
which he could identify himself with the ruling class, in color if not in
economic status, and thus lay claim to a cultural heritage ludicrously beyond
the scope of his real condition. y

At the end of the War, class antagonisms began to, re-emerge. The futile
attempts of the South to restore its economy through concentration on
cotton (“King Cotton”) aggravated the conditions of the poor white, who
was expropriated and in large part converted into the white tenant and
sharecropper, “the head and front of the poor white class from that day
to this: a mighty and always multiplying horde of the landless, who, in
order to eat, must turn to laboring for their more fortunate neighbors on
whatever terms the latter offered.” (The Mind of the South.)

Under the pressure of a new group of local banker-merchants and, pri-
marily, of the Northern dealers, the cotton growers, in order to reap proﬁts
out of a basically unproﬁtable enterprise, ruthlessly exploited the poor white
class, and as a weapon in this exploitation, encouraged hatred of the Negro.
The lower the white tenant farmer sank into the economic bondage that

had been the lot of the slave, the stronger grew his hostility toward the
Negro, over whom he sought; to assert his mastery through violence and
adherence to the doctrine of white supremacy. The poor white, who previ-
ously had his own plot of land, however unproductive, now found himself
in competition with the Negro on a level which for all intents and purposes
was comparable to slavery. And as long as the expropriated whites focused
their hostility on the Negro, and not on their exploiters among the banker-
merchant interests, backed by Northern capital, those interests were safe.
There is no question but that the poor white’s absorption in Negrophobia
constituted the primary psychological deterrent to his perceiving clearly
his own social and economic plight.

In 1891, however, a movement did grow up that challenged the racial
solidarity of the poor whites. The Populists attracted masses of poor farmers
and workers under a banner of class action. Addressing himself directly
to the problems of color prejudice, Georgia Populist leader Tom Watson
told the two races: “You are made to hate each other because upon that
hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of ﬁnancial despotism which
enslaves you both. You are deceived and blinded that you may not see how
this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars you
both.” Though relatively short—lived, Populism played a dramatic role in
race relations. It make remarkable inroads in the poor white’s Negrophobia
and demonstrated the revolutionary possibilities of Negro-poor white unity
against the big planters and capitalists. Equally important, Populism
recruited and trained Negro political leaders, and elected them to offices
on a par with whites.

But the Populists also succumbed andseventually abandoned the Negro.
They were crushed by the conservatives, who used their domination of the
Black Belt to pile up votes against the Populists and for white supremacy.
Negroes in the Black Belt were intimidated by the conservatives to oppose
the rising tide of Populism and if intimidation didn’t work, thousands of
ballots were forged. The result of this was a growing disillusionment with
the Negro among Watson and the Populists. They had always had a hard
enough time as it was selling their radical approach to race relations; now
Negro opposition (though manipulated) to their program convinced many
that the Negro was indeed the enemy of the poor white. By the end of the
90's the movement had reversed its attitude toward the Negro, and thus
ended an extraordinary chapter in interracial class action in the South.

Three restraining political currents had to disengage or be driven from
defense of the Negro before racism could triumph in the South. The ﬁrst,
Northern liberalism (Radical Republicanism) withdrew in 1877. The second,
Populism, abandoned the Negro in the late 1890's. Conservatism was the
third. It did not so much disengage as it did deteriorate into something
quite different from its traditional form. Morally undermined by its manipu-
lation of the Negro, and economically threatened by the increasingly resent-
ful depression—weary poor whites, conservatism became less capable of acting
as a bulwark against racism. (Previously, we recall, the conservatives had
eschewed racial violence and had tended to emphasize class distinctions over
race distinctions.)

The course taken by any of these major currents was intimately related
to the course of the others. When the North withdrew its troops, it left
the South in the hands, not of the racists (the old Democrats), but of the
conservatives (the old Whigs). The Compromise of 1877 was a deal made
between Northern and Southern industrialists, that is, between the Repub-
licans and the old Whig conservatives, who identiﬁed with each other’s
interests, whose common aims transcended sectional differences, and who
would tend to react similarly to a given situation. Thus the disengagement
of the Republicans, while it did not deliver the Negro directly into the
hands of the racists, nonetheless foreshadowed the later disengagement (or
deterioration) of the conservatives. When the Republicans let the bottom
out from under the Negro, he fell into the net of the conservatives. When
that net collapsed, he had nowhere to fall but down to the rock-bottom
of racism.

How could the North, which presumably had liberated the Negro from
slavery, permit him to be disfranchised, segregated and terrorized?

Beneath‘ the genuinely moral outcry against slavery on the part of the
abolitionists and many men of good will, the essential desire of the rapidly
industrializing Northern capitalism was the destruction of the semi-feudal
plantation system, which was incompatible with the overall technological
growth of the nation into a world power. Because slavery was at the base
of this plantation system, it was outlawed in the course of the Civil War
as a means of bringing the South to its knees economically.

However, once the Civil War ended, the Reconstruction had in effect
secured hegemony for the Northern capitalists over the Southern economy,
the old motives—'having been satisﬁed——gave way to new ones, which revealed
the extent to which the industrialists really had the interest of the Negro
at heart. For, in the last decades of the 19th century, textile factories began
to spring up providing a new source of employment for the poor whites.
In the mills exploitation was even more ruthless than on the cotton
farms, and the trend toward racial segregation became even more acute.

The cheap labor market——the South's main attraction for Northern capital
—depended in large measure upon segregation and discrimination, as it
does to this day. The Negro, without a vote and without a union card,
has little to say about his wages and is up against a take-it—or—leave—it proposi-
tion. In addition, the presence of a politically disfranchised and economically
uprooted Negro population represented a threat to the poor whites because
if the latter sought to improve their economic status, their bosses could
always threaten to turn them out and give their jobs to Negroes who, in
desperation, would work for less.

Thus, the Northern capitalist, having ﬁrst required the liberation of the
Negro as a means of decimating the semi-feudal plantation economy, now
watched contentedly the political disfranchisement and economic depression
of the Negro in the interest of a new exploitation, the proﬁts from which
would now accrue to the Northern industrial ruling class, rather than to
its Southern Bourbon counterpart.

To sum up, then: the gigantic and pervasive structure of racial segrega-
tion and discrimination, of race hate and vio1en(:e, of elaborate theories of
white supremacy, grew up, in the main, after the Civil War, after the defeat
ol,' the South, after Northern capital had established national hegemony and
domination of the Southern economy.

FOREWORD

In the heat of struggle, it often happens that the deepest implications of a
mass movement are not understood. Historically, the marriage of action and
analysis has been difficult to forge. Caught up in the day-to-day tasks and
perils imposed by our situation, Southern Negro leaders have not always
been able to take out the time to interpret and project the struggle for
Negro freedom in its fullest dimensions.

This pamphlet, written by a young man who has worked on the Youth
Marches for Integrated Schools and in a number of other important civil
rights projects, makes a unique contribution toward ﬁlling this void. In
these times, when youth have launched an historic offensive against Jim
Crow and when indeed our movement as a whole is infused with the energy
and idealism of youth—in these times it is altogether ﬁtting that this
penetrating document should have been written by a young person..

Those of us in the South who have our backs to the wall and who daily
risk dangers to which no other single group in our country is subjected,
recognize that ultimately the Negro cannot win his ﬁght alone. The students
have shown the way, but other progressive segments of the community must
become our allies if we are to enjoy full freedom and lay the foundations
for a new and thoroughly democratic society. And, therefore, while I do not
necessarily agree with every statement or formulation in this comprehensive
work, I heartily welcome its publication. It is a profound analysis not only
of the Negro movement, but of the forces which must become our allies if
they are themselves ever to live genuinely in dignity, freedom and peace.
I have often said that the fruits of our struggle enhance not only the Negro
but all Americans. In no comparable publication has this thesis been so
readably and substantially documented.

I highly recommend this pamphlet to all who want really to understand
the changes which must be made in our political, social and economic way
of life if civil rights are to be won in full, and who seek the most effective
means of advancing our common cause. I urge this pamphlet upon all
students and adults who participate in the non-violent movement. For they
should understand in depth the full glory of our struggle—a struggle through
which we can help transform the face of the nation and record an indelible
chapter in the history of the eternal mass movement for human freedom.

J. M. LAWSON, JR.

 

 

FOREWORD

Far and away, the most hopeful event on the American scene in the year 1960
has been the widespread student sit-in strikes against discrimination in lunch-
rooms. They were the more signiﬁcant because they were started by Negro
students themselves, and spread so rapidly in the South, awakening as they
spread a heartening degree of support, especially from young people and
students, white as well as colored, all over the United States.

Not the least important consequence of the strikes‘ begun by a handful of
colored students in Greensboro, N. C., is the appearance of this important
pamphlet. Its author, himself a young man, has’ shown unusual ability to
think and write clearly about the Gandhian revolt of the Negro, which is
of such great importance to us all. Mr. Kahn writes well, he states facts
accurately, he interprets them persuasively, and he suggests courses of action
of great potential value for the realization of true democracy. The sacriﬁces
he calls for promise ricn reward.

So good a piece of work needs no explanatory introduction. I write only
by way of recommendation of this excellent pamphlet to your thoughtful
consideration and appropriate action.
