 

WHAT POLITICAL
PRISONERS DO WE
DEFEND?

HOSE who are imprisoned

or persecuted because of
participation in struggles re-
volving around the rights of
Workers and of small farmers,
and those imprisoned because
of race or nationality.

THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE for the
DEFENSE of POLITICAL PRISONERS

156 Fifth Avenue, Nevg. York City

HE NATIONAL COMMITTEE

recognizes that there are in our
present society those who own the means
of production and those who must offer
their labor in exchange for Wages. This
division makes conﬂict inevitable.

The police, the courts, and other
agencies of the State, cannot remain im-
partial in this conﬂict. They represent
the dominating class.

The National Committee seeks the
enforcement of state and federal bills
of rights and supports the demand for
civil and political rights of those to
whom they are denied because of race,
nationality, or Working-class activity.

TS FUNCTION
To defend those in prison because of:
(a) Taking part in strikes, organiz-
ing unions, distributing literature
and similar activities.

(b) Being a member of an oppressed

race or national group.

The National Committee realizes that
mass protest is a vital defense factor. It
therefore assists defense organizations
motivated by this principle:——

By sending investigators and commit-

‘ tees into localities Where the rights of

human beings are ruthlesslyobliterated;
by broadcasting facts, through newspa-
pers, circulars, letters, pamphlets, public
meetings.

 

By raising funds to assist in legal de-
fense and arousing public opinion.

By providing ﬁnancial and medical
aid to political prisoners, their wives and
children. »
