SUPERIOR, Ariz.—A package settlement worth
more than 26 cents an hour in wage, shift premium and
pension plan gains was nailed down here Jan. 28 in new
agreements between Mine-Mill and Magma Copper Com-
pany in Superior and San Manuel. _ .

It was the second settlement within a week reached
by Mine-Mill with major copper producers. Agreement
was reached during the preceding week with Phelps
Dodge Corporation for its Arizona properties in Bisbee,
Douglas and Morenci, and for its copper refinery in El
Paso, Texas. Int’l Secretary-Treasurer Irving Dichter
headed up the negotiations with both companies.

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah-—A workable common bargaining approach for joint
negotiations with Kennecott Copper in its 4-state Western Division has been laid out
by the Utah Unity Council; consisting of representatives from Mine-Mill and other
bargaining units at the company’s Utah division mines and mills.

“The purpose and goal of the Utah Unity Council,” a statement adopted by the

 
 

site of ‘ Mine-Mill’s

57th convention which opens March 26. It will mark the first time
the union’s International convention will have been held in Canada.

 

Various unions in the joint
group declares,» “is to
achieve maximum gains and
benefits for all members‘ of the
participating local unions and
lodges in our 1962 contract ne-
gotiations with Kennecott Cop-
per Corporation. The unions
firmly believe this can best be
accomplished and achieved by
uniting and presenting a com-
mon bargaining program to
Kennecott Copper on all issues
that have common applicability
to all Kennecott employees.”

AS guideposts for this unified
bargaining approach, the par-
ticipating unions drafted a ,3-
point set of rules for local ap-
proval. These state that:

1. Each bargaining unit rec-
ognizes . the obligations, re-
sponsibilities and allegiances
that «each participating local or
lodge has to its parent organiza-
tion and/or. international union;

2. All participating unions of

the Council will conduct joint
negotiations on wages, health
and welfare, pensions, sever-

Similarly, the hard cash wage
and shift pay increases were
put into effect more than five
months before the existing con-
tracts were due to expire on
July 1, 1962.

Barraza said the new money
increases were along the lines
of those gained in the PD settle-
ment, plus
plan benefits. He said the union
estimates the total package is
worth in excess of 26 cents an
hour.

Federal MineSafety
Study is Under Way

DENVER—The federal mine safety study, called
for by special legislation pushed through Congress with
Mine-Mill support last year, is now under way.‘ The Bu-
reau of Mines of the U. S. Interior Department IS respon-
sible for the study, which must be completed in time for

a report with recommenda-
tions to be submitted to
Congress by September, 1962.

Mine-Mill has offered 100 per-
cent cooperation to the Bureau
of Mines. Assistant Secretary
of the Interior John M. Kelly

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

WASHINGTON, D. C.-Every
major point of Hearing Exam-
iner Francis A. Cherry’s “rec-
‘ ommended decision” against
Mine-Mill was blasted in a de-
tailed document of exceptions
filed by the union’s attorneys
here February 1 with the Sub-
versive Activities C ontrol
. Board. I
f First and foremost, the ex-
ceptions show Cherry complete-

A ‘A ly ignored the evidence that the

prosecution’s few important wit-

. ‘. nesses were outright liars, per-
zjurers or otherwise proved to

-b_e._ut_Itrustworthy characters.

 

Gardner and three others never
even connected with Mine-Mill.
Two of the latter, Duran and
Kent, were paid informers. The
third,-Barbara Hartle, was pa-
roled as a Smith Act prisoner
after she became a professional
witness for the government.
bi= >l= =I=

THE glaring significance of
this evidence is in the fact that
Mine-Mill also. showed during
the SACB hearings that the
government attorneys knew
these witnesses were not telling
the truth.

The Supreme Court has held,
where this is so, that the cases
must be dismissed altogether

the Hearing Examiner’s

Cherry Decision

since knowledge of the govern-
ment attorneys that their wit-
nesses committed perjury is a
violation of due process of law
as guaranteed by the Constitu-
tion.

Cherry’s failure to deal with
the issues bearing on credibility
of the witnesses against Mine-
Mill is called, in the exceptions,
“incredible” and a clear indica-
tion of his own bias.

=14 >3

:2:

THE exceptions also attack

fusal to come to grips with legal

provisions which limit the evi-

dence to ‘a three year period

preceding the filingfof the peti-

re- -

tion that initiated, the case.
Since the petition was filed in
July, 1955, the only relevant
evidence would relate to the pe-
riod from July, 1952 to July,
1955.

But in his report, Cherry
saysthat “questions as to the
meaning, of the three year pro-
visions are not of substantial
importance.” The exceptions
point out that Cherry brushed
aside this problem because the
evidence -within the 3-year period
is so meagre-—even if the wit-
nesses against Mine-Mill were
to be believed—that the case
would have to be dismissed if

Members Like New

Contract Settlements

HILE our recent settlements with the Phelps Dodge
and Magma Copper companies may in some ways
have come as a surprise to members around the country,
there is no question but that the solid gains involved
certainly created a great deal of satisfaction to the work-
, ers themselves in PD and Magma. This was
is proved in my tour of the Southwest during the
last few weeks.
I was able to visit the locals in Arizona and
El Paso, Texas, installing new officers in
Morenci and the officers of both the local and
auxiliary in Bisbee. I attended and spoke not
only at the membership meetings in Bisbee
and Morenci, but also in Douglas, San Manuel,
Hayden, Ray, Superior, Miami, the Banner
local in Tucson, in El Paso and at the Arizona
Council meeting as well.
As soon as it was known that the Phelps
' ‘ Dodge company was willing to negotiate on an
early settlement of the contract, both our PD
Council and the local negotiating committees
were called in by the Coordinator and they, through full discussion,
recognized the importance to their members of pursuing that op-
portunity.
This prompted a move by our Magma Council and, within a
few days, an agreement was reached with the Magma company.

T SEEMS that these settlements, which brought substantial

cash increases to our members and assured labor peace and
stability in their communities, have raised a furor among certain
disrupters who are more interested in signing raid petitions than
getting benefits for the workers.

The Steel leaders heading the raid in Douglas, who had been
spreading their lying propaganda that Mine-Mill was unable to
bargain, were taken aback. Undoubtedly in spite of the benefits
of these contracts to the workers, they will continue their despicable
abortive attempts to divide the workers and follow their program
of breaking up unions.

On a broader scale the results of such disruptive activities
are already evident in the American and Canadian labor move-
ment generally. The Steel union itself, the worst of the raiding
culprits, in the past five years has lost over 350 Labor Board elec-
tions. During the period 1956-1960 Steel has lost more than 98,000
members, and not solely through automation or other economic
causes. The election losses reported by the NLRB definitely show
the lack of trust or desire of the unorganized to join unions while
such a record is being built by the top leaders of organized labor.

To place that record against the Teamsters Union, which
showed a gain of 352,000 members between 1956 and 1961, surely
should induce an appraisal of the difference between a fighting
union and a destroying union.

‘kit

HEN I was invited to install the officers of Douglas Local
470 and give them their obligation of this union as leaders
to fight for and protect it and its members,.the seeds of dissent
had already been spread by Steel among them. After taking the
obligation they refused to support their oath and were quickly
removed from office to protect the interests of the rank and file.

I am sure -the membership of this local will realize the purpose
of the secession leaders and will remember the company back-door
deals which have been made in the past by these converted saviours
of labor. I feel sure the membership will rid their local of this
type of money-hungry mercenaries and rebuild their local to
maintain unity with the rest of the Phelps Dodge workers.

It would be well to question these Steel raid leaders about some
of Steel’s own settlements recently in the non—ferrous metals indus-

~ try, such as:

***k

T THE Iron King (Shattuck Denn) Mine in Arizona, where

Steel signed a sliding scale contract based on the price of
zinc, the workers took an average pay cut of 44 cents per shift last
year. Then, after a two-months strike, Steel signed a new contract
Dec. 15, 1961, with a wage increase of 7 cents an hour. Their
shift differentials are still 4 and 8 cents an hour.

At the Lucky Friday Mine in Idaho Steel signed a 2-year agree-

, ment in 1959 with no increase at all the first year. Last year they

struck for three months after rejecting a company 3-year contract
offer of 18 cents, then finally settled for a 3-year package deal of

18.85 cents, less than a cent more than they were ‘offered before .

the strike. Their wage increases were 6‘/2 cents in December, 1961,
tliggnts effective December, 1962, and 5 cents effective December,

Another Steel settlement was made with the Calumet & Hecla
copper mining company in upper Michigan, providing for 51/2 cents
an hour on Aug. 22, 1961, and 6 cents to be effective Aug. 22, 1962.
Steel’s present wage rates at Calumet & Hecla range from $13.66
per shift for laborers to a top of $16.68 per shift for the highest
paid) worker in that entire mining, milling and smelting operation.

‘Ir *’ *
IT WOULD also be well to question the honesty and integrity of

certain of these self-styled “labor leaders” in regard to their
erstwhile support of every phase of the defense of Mine-Mill and

V their vituperations against the cannibalistic raiding by Steel, their

present, employer.
.What is the real reason for their changeand their union-busting

activities. today? . , » V ' ‘L

AS Council Chairman David
Duarte and Coordinator Frank
Vettorel were lobbying for the
union’s program at the state
capital Feb. 13-15, another bill
(H. B. 229) was introduced by
the House Labor Committee to
give the State Mine Inspector
jurisdiction over mills and
smelters, and which would ap-
propriate $40,000 to hire addi-
tional personnel to carry out in-
spections. This means that bills
for expansion of the Mine In-
spector’s jurisdiction are now
in the hopper in both the House
and Senate.

At the same time, the 10 Ari-
zona Council locals were inten-
sifying their campaign to‘ get
bills introduced to revise the
State Mining Code and bring it
up to date with modern opera-

_ tions.

Headway thus far toward ac-
tion on the safety and health
measures is the direct result of
the union’s legislative work on
several fronts laid out by the
Council at recent meetings.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

Vice-Presidenf:

INCO Workers Set
To Vote in Sudbury ,

THE biggest labor board election in Mine-Mill history
takes place in Canada Feb. 27, 28 and March 1 at
North America’s largest mining and smelting operations.
Eligible to vote are some 15,000 employees of Interna-
tional Nickel Company, members of Mine-Mill Sudbury

* Local 598. The election is the result of the all-
out Steel raid launched last Fall in Port Co-
borne and Sudbury, Ontario, and Thompson,
Manitoba.

This is a strange election ordered by the
Ontario Labor Relation Board in Sudbury. It
is called a “pre-hearing election.” The pro-
cedure permits the Ontario. Board to conduct
a vote, seal and impound the ballots, and
then hear arguments for and against an elec-
tion after the ballots have been cast!

Mine-Mill has raised many objections to
this election which ordinarily should have
been heard before the Board ordered it. They
include Ste_el’s submission of fraudulent appli-
cation cards, required initiation fees not paid
by signers, insufficient number of authentic cards to warrant an
election, etc. We have numerous affidavits and testimony to sup-
port such charges which cannot be submitted until hearings are
held after the voting is completed.

**‘lr

 

Skinner

FOR all intents and ‘purposes the Sudbury raid began nearly

three years ago when the so-called Gillis slate of Local 598
officers, without the membership’s knowledge, began underhand
conniving to pull the local out of Mine-Mill.

The conspiracy became so brazen last summer that two local
executive’ board members resigned and exposed the whole plot.
One of them, Tom Tyler, signed an 8-page affidavit recording
numerous secret meetings and discussions between Gillis and

A other local officers with Steel and Canadian Labor Congress of-

ficials. For a long time Gillis argued that Local 598 should not
affiliate with Steel but directly with the CLC. He knew that at-
tempts to “blitz” the membership into Steel would encounter
widespread opposition.

Since November all local membership meetings have been
cancelled by Gillis because he could no longer stack and control

them.
* * ‘k

ILLIS’ clique has continuously attacked Mine-Mill’s National

and International leaders for over two years. They criticized
Canadian leaders for not organizing INCO’s big new operations in
Thompson. When the Canadian leaders opened up the Thompson
drive, the Gillis forces threw their support to Steel against Mine-
Mill. When we defeated Steel and signed a three-year 83-cent pack-
age settlement at Thompson, the Gillis leadership joined Steel in
callingit a “sellout.”

The Steel raid in Sudbury has been going full blast since last

‘September. Daily TV programs, full-page newspaper ads, bill-

board signs and close to a million leaflets have been sponsored
and distributed by Steel in collusion with the Gillis officers.

We estimate Steel has been spending $100,000 a month on the
raids in Sudbury and Thompson. In addition to their lavish propa-
ganda campaign, they have been paying weekly subsidies and ex-
penses to volunteer organizers, offering money and prizes for
signed cards, dishing out free beer and whiskey, and making all
kinds of promises, deals and other inducements for support.

In Thompson, for instance, you can get two cartons of ciga-
rettes and a bottle of whiskey for signing a Steel card. Joining
Steel’s “volunteer” crew is worth $100 a week, an expensive parka
and traveling bag (the latter is probably insurance when the rank
and file sends Steel packing)‘. -

‘k ‘* ‘k
UDBURY is the best organized union town in Canada with one

of the highest wage scales and per capita income. Since Mine-
Mill Local 598 was certified in 1944 it has set the pace in Canadian
industry for wages, fringes and contract benefits. The Sudbury
local developed a program of recreation, social and community
activity second to none in the Canadian labor movement. It has
a big modern camp providing summer—long recreation for thous-
ands of children and the families of Local 598 members.’

To launch a destructive raid on this local ‘with its record of
achievement for its membership is one of the most callous and
shameful events in the history of organized labor.

Steel’s largest Canadian local (8,500 members) is at the Stelco
plant in Hamilton, Ontario. Just across the road from Stelco is
the Dominion Steel plant with 4,500 non-union steel. workers. Steel
leaders have made no serious attempt in recent years to organize
these workers. .

* ~k *

SCORES of similar examples of unorganized plants exist_ 

Canada. Of six million employed workers in Canada, only 11/2
million are in trade unions. Can anyone justify the insane waste
of dues money on this destructive raid againstunion men in Sud-
bury while 4% million Canadian workers remain unorganiz'ed?

The details of this dirty conspiracy by CLC and Steel leaders
are reaching the rank and file ‘members of many unions in
Canada. Thisraid has been officially ‘condemned by local unions
in Steel itself, Auto, Textile, Public Employees, UE and many
others affiliated with the CLC. A big membership meeting of

Cherry Decision Blasted

(Continued from page 1)

only that evidence was con-
sidered. ‘

Most of Cherry’s report, in
fact, is taken up with matters
which were supposed to have
happened in the 1940’s and
even as far back as the 1930’s.
The only witness of any signifi-
cance to events during the 1952-
1955 period is the Army desert-
er and perjurer, Fred Gardner,
who was fired by Mine-Mill in
June of 1955.

It should be noted that the
case against Mine-Mill before
the SACB was started the fol-
lowing ,month, after Gardner
had begun telling his stories to
the FBI. Apparently, Mine-Mill
became "communist-infiltrated”
onlywhen it fired the self-‘con-
fessed Communist, Fred Gard-
ner!

ANOTHER important section
of the exceptions deals with the
“evidence” cited by Cherry to
show that Mine-Mill has fol-
lowed policies similar to those
of the Communist Party. There
are 25 findings in Cherry-’s re-
port dealing with this question,
but only a few refer to «mat-
ters within the 1952-1955 period.

What are those findings like?
As cited by Cherry: President
Clark spoke in favor of peace,
Dichter spoke" in favor of a
third party “of the people,”
Mine-Mill conventions in 1952
and 1955 ‘passed resolutions for
the repeal of Taft-Hartley, and
so forth. No evidence is cited
that Mine-Mill supported com-
munism or force and violence
or anything else of that kind.

But the fact that Mine-Mill
went on record against persecu-
tions of the Negro people, as in
the cases of Willie McGee and
the “Trenton Six,” is also used
by Cherry as evidence of “Com-
munist” policies.

IT IS this part of Cherry’s
report which raises the most
clear-cut issues under the First
Amendment to the Constitution.
The underlying theory of Cher-
ry’s report is that a union which
happens to take positions simi-
lar "to those of the Communist
P a r t y is “communist-infil-
trated”; so that, to cite another
example, he refers to a Mine-

SIGNALLING To EACH omen, LIKE THIS...’

Mill convention resolution using
the word “co-existence” as
proof against the union because

.C o In m u ni s t s are supporting

“peaceful co-existence.”

To be safe, in other words, a
union must adopt policies oppo-
site to those of the Communist
Party or not take any position
at all on the same issues. Since
the Party was against Taft-
Hartley, Mine-Mill should have
been for it. If the CP is for
peace, Mine-Mill must be for
war. If the Communists agitate
for civil rights and against dis-
crimination, Mine-Mill should
support the Dixiecrats. Accord-
ing to this logic, if the Commu-
nist Party is for higher wages
and shorter hours, Mine-Mill
must come out for wage cuts
and longer hours. The only al-
ternative is to keep mum.

Mine-Mi11’s attorneys are con-
vinced that the Supreme Court
will never uphold such an inter-
pretation of the law, even if

ChargesFa|se, Barraza
Tells Young Democrats

TUCSON, Ariz.——District 2 Board Member M. R.
Barraza told an audience here Feb. 7 that the SACB
charge against Mine-Mill is just “another one of those
attacks we have experienced since the union was founded

in 1893.”
“we have always tried to
better working conditions
and pay in the mining camps.”

Addressing a Young Demo-

.crats of Greater Tucson lunch-

eon at the, airport Skyroom,
Barraza expressed confidence
that “the false charges leveled
at the union in the‘ SACB case
will be thrown into the ash can
when we have our day in court.”
“We are not going to let any-
body destroy our union on any
unfounded charges,” he de-
clared.

ESTABLISHMENT of their
own junior college district was
approved by Cochise County
voters in a special election held
last October, following adop-
tion of the new state law.

Political observers at the
time were convinced that the
united campaign carried on by

the two locals was a big factor .

in the relatively heavy vote to
carry the measure.

Both state and county actions
now make it possible to have a
Cochise Junior College in 1963.
A date for another’ election, in
which the county’s voters ‘will
be asked to approve a bond is-
sue to finance construction of

the $1 million college, was still ‘

to be set.

Startling Disclosures Revealed in

HEW Aged Health Care Report

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Only 72,159 of the Nation’s
17 million aged persons are benefiting from the Kerr-
Mills Medical Assistance program approved by Congress

two years ago.

Moreover, ninety-two cents of every $1 being spent

under the existing Federal-
State assistance program
(MAA) goes to pay the bills of
medically indigent persons in
three Northern States.

T h e s e startling disclosures,
revealed by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare,
could crack wide open one of
the major obstructions to Con-
gressional action "of the Ander-
son-King health care bill.

For many months the Ameri-

Sign of the Times

The City of New York re-
cently advertised that it had
50 job openings for charwom-
en, at top pay of $53 per week.
When the doors opened the
next day, 2,359 women applied
for the 50 jobs. Some of the
women stood in line as long
as three days.

trumpeted loudly that the MAA 0

program, growing out of the
1960 Kerr-Mills Act, is the an-
swer to health care needs of
aged who cannot afford to pay
skyrocketing hospital and doc-
tor bills.

>2‘ >2‘ 5.:

THIS pitch has been echoed

~ by the co-authors of the Kerr-

Mills legislation. Just weeks
ago, the powerful chairman of
the House Ways and Means
Committee, Wilbur Mills, re-
stated his opposition to a social
security medical care program
on the ground the MAA pro-
gram had not been proven in-
adequate.

Earlier, Sen. Robert Kerr, a
key member of the Senate com-
mittee that must act on health
care legislation, asserted in
substance he wouldn’t support
a new program until its need
had been demonstrated.

Whether the HEW report was
intended to pull the rug out
from under Kerr-Mills support-
ers or not, it certainly goes a
long way toward accomplishing
just that by providing a factual
analysis of the MAA operation.

>2: =l= =1-

THE SUMMARY shows that
$13.9 million in Federal-State
funds was made available for
aged beneficiaries last Decem-
ber. Of that total, $12.5 million
can be credited to only three
states, New York, Massachu-
setts and Michigan.

As for the 72,159 p e r s o n s
drawing assistance, 51,549 lived
in the three states spending the
l a r g e s t -amounts. The HEW
s u m m a r y also shows that a
mere 17 states and the Virgin
Islands were making payments
under the MAA program in De-
cember. The AMA, on the other
hand, claims 27 states are par-
ticipating.

ciation propagandists, who have

‘Labor Has No Friends in
Ultra—Right League’-Hoffa

“Labor has no friends” in the ultra-right-wing move-
ment of this country, Teamster President James R. Hoffa
warned in the February issue of his union_’s magazine,

The International Teamster.

Linking the John Birch Society with the “right-to-

work” backers, he noted
that such right-wing groups
have now formed a nation-wide

- league “which every day be-

comes stronger, more articulate,
and more suave.”
“The announced purpose of

-the league,” Hoffa -wrote, “ is

to fight Communism, which by
itself is a noble cause. But I
long ago became suspicious of

’ self-styled patriots peddling do-

it-yourself kits for fighting Com-

munispm.
2‘: at: it!

“NEVER, to my knowledge,

have any of these organizations
been champions of the working
man or his union, although they
often attempt to infiltrate labor
to accomplish their ends. . . .
“Under the guise of attacking
International Communism, these
groupshave a history of parti-
cipation in anti-labor action and
legislation; they have a history
of branding everyone with a new
idea as a Communist; they have
a history‘ of branding as a Com-

ent, apolitical philosophy. ’_They-

smeared as being Communist
motivated, as witness the Sen-
ate internal security subcommit-
tee hearing last fall.
=l= =1: :2:

“I DOUBT that any Commu-

nists will be hindered by the co-

alition ofultra-right-wing
groups.

“What I fear is that any co-
alition from the ultra-right will
lead to an onslaught against or-
ganized labor, civil rights, and
the whole broad spectrum of
individual freedom, much of
which is already denied to or-
ganized labor.”

“If we‘ in organized labor,”
Hoffa concluded, “are to sur-
vive the Cold War, the‘ anti-
Communist hysteria, national
emergencies which give excuses
to further restrict labor rights,
a11—officia1s and rank-and-file
alike-—must be more alert than
we have been in the past.

with the truth in fighting the
Anderson-King bill, included
states as being lined up with
Kerr-Mills w h e r e legislation
was enacted but no money ap-
propriated.
>l= >3: it

EVEN among the 17 states
actively participating, some
show only a handful of recipi-
ents. Utah, for example, lists
27; New Hampshire, 25 and
Louisiana 8.

Another significant point is
the wide range in the benefits
as worked out from state to
state. Kentucky made an aver;
age of $15.60 compared with
$285.43 in New York. Michigan’s
expenditures for 4,253 recipients
were ten times the amount

 

Maryland paid out to aid 6,814

aged.

The home states of the pro-'

gram’s authors, -Mills and Kerr,
accounted for negligible por-
tions of the total MAA money
spent in December. Arkansas’s
share amounted to .2 per cent
and 0klahoma’s expenses were

.4 per cent.
 =l= . bk

THE ‘great disparity in the
implementation of the Federal-
State program is accounted
for by the fact that eligibility
qualifications and health care
benefits are fixed by the indi-
vidual states. These, in turn,
depend upon how a state defines
its version of a means test
formula and how much money

- is appropriated to match open-

end Federal grants.

By contrast, the Anderson-
King bill sets up standard na-
tional benefits and a person’s
right to claim these benefits
depends upon whether he is
covered by social security and
not on the state in which he
may reside.

Even if the uneven nature of
the Kerr-Mills program be
glossed over, its supporters
will have a hard time from now
on out arguing that the 72,159
persons helped is the answer to
the health care problem of the
Nation’s senior citizens.—ILWU

Unemployment Rate Fails ti
Include Million Job Seekers

WASHINGTON, D. C.,—-While the government’s seasonally adjusted unempljoy
ment rate for January slipped below 6 per cent for the first time in 16 monthvs,-*5
claimed improvement is apparently masking the actual extent of joblessness. The ’.Ja~
ary rate, said the Labor -Department’s preliminary report, was 5.8 per cent, agairis
6 per cent in December. The unemployment total was estimated at 4.7 million, up-isorn

600,000 from the previous
month because of what
were described as purely sea-
sonal factors.

But behind these statistical
formulations, a surprising fact
stands out. The civilian labor
force-—the base used for com-
puting the jobless rate-showed
a drop of 116,000 during the 12

months since January 1961. This

falloff takes on significance
when it‘ is understood that
growth in population means that
the number of job seekers
should be around one million
more than a year ago.

When this phenomenon was
called to the attention of Sey-

     
  
  
    
     

mour L. Wolfbein, the Labor De-
partment’s manpower expert,
he shrugged it off. Later, how-
ever, Secretary Arthur J. Gold-
berg termed it “peculiar.”
‘ * Il¢ it

GOING on to say the Depart-
ment was studying the lack of
growth in the labor force, Gold-
berg explained that high unem-
ployment could have caused
many persons who ordinarily
would be looking for work to
drop out of the job market.

Whatever the explanation for
the disappearance of around a
million job seekers, their ab-

European Coal

180,000 jobs in French, Bel-
gian and West German coal
mines have been eliminated
since 1957-58, in accordance
with plans of coal producing
member nations of the Euro-
pean Common Market to elimi-
nate “marginal” mines and in-
crease output per worker. _ Al-
leged’ reason for the move is to
make coal‘ more competitive
price-wise with petroleum im-
ports.

Last year, after closing of 18
mines, 416,000 West German
coal miners produced more coal
than 546,000 mined in 1958.
Whether the speedup shown by
these figures was responsible for
the death last month of 300 coal
miners at the Luisenthal mine
near Saarbrucken, Germany, is
yet to be determined.

Displaced miners are being
“retrained” for other work, as
is being proposed for workers

tariffs President Kennedy seeks
authority to negotiate.

Two weeks after their agree-

ing for a general pay hike of
161/2 per cent, increases in
fringe benefits- in the same» pro-
portion, and special bonuses for
all workers. The old agreement
had been extended for two
weeks and the new agreement

was signed just before a Jan-.

uary 14 strike deadline.

The contract at Kennecott’s
El Teniente mine in Chile ex-
pires next March 31. Negotia-
tions were opened early in Jan-

pany. At Mine-Mill press time
the parties were far from agree-
ment.

Wildcat Strikes I

4,000 workers struck Cerro de
Pasco Corporation’s smelters
and refineries at La Oroya,
Peru, for nine days recently
over payment of year-end bon-
uses. The struck plants produce
copper, lead, zinc and silver.

Almost halfway around the
world, the Northern Rhodesian
African Mine Workers -Union

. struck the Ndola copper refin-

ery because of failure of author-
ities to install electric lights in
houses provided the workers by
the company. The men went
back to work when union rep-

lights would be installed in all
houses.

  

BETTER PROSPECTS FOR ZINC are marked by recovery in
price late last year to 12 cents per pound, expectations in trade
circles that price will go higher, and a flurry of recent optimistic
reports.

Here are some sample headlines: §‘SLAB ZINC USE UP 5.3%
IN 1961, FURTHER RISE EXPECTED THIS YEAR”; “GAL-
VANIZED SHEET SHIPMENTS SET NEW RECORD IN ’61”;
“ ’61 ZINC SHIPMENTS TO DOMESTIC CONSUMERS SECOND
BEST ON RECORD”; “COMMERCE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS
7-9 PER CENT RISE IN ZINC USE IN 1962”; “US 1961 MINE
PRODUCTION OF ZINC UP 7 PER CENT TO 467,000 TONS, HIGH-
EST OUTPUT SINCE 1957.”

Zinc mining companies are beginning to react to better
prospects: New Jersey Zinc Co. has reopened Sterling ‘mine at
Ogdensburg, N. J., while Anaconda Company is getting ready to
resume zinc production in Butte next March. No zinc was mined
in Butte in 1961.

LEAD HIT A NEW POSTWAR LOW, when price dipped to 9%; _

cents per pound in mid-February. Price in London at the same
time dipped to equivalent of about 7 cents.

Sluggish consumption of lead and large inventories keep press-

per cent in 1961, but consumption gained only 1 per cent.

ANACONDA COMPANY has announced it will build a new
copper ore concentrating plant in Butte to concentrate all ores
now shipped to Anaconda, Mont., for concentration.

Industry sources put the cost of the project at $30 million.
Some equipment now in use in Anaconda will be reconditioned and
installed in Butte. Work is to start immediately with completion
scheduled in about three years.

Work on the new plant will be scheduled so as not to lessen
copper production capacity during the construction period. Clyde
E. Weed, board chairman of Anaconda company said the new plant
would result in more efficient processing, higher recoveries, and
reduced transportation costs.

Concentrates, weighing about one twenty-fifth as much as
copper ores, will be shipped to Anaconda, Mont., for smelting.

LEAD AND ZINC may be involved in some horse trading,
according to Wall Street Journal for February 14. In a dispatch
datelined Washington, D. C., the Journal says President Kennedyis
request for tariff cutting powers will run into stiff opposition. HIS
aides are reported as saying the President is prepared to use
promises, rewards, threats and arm-twisting to get his tariff cut-
ting bill through Congress. The dispatch says, “If western mining
state lawmakers appear to hold the balance of power on the trade
issue, some help could be extended to the troubled lead and zinc

A industries.”

FORMULATION of the pro-
gram capped a series of meet-
ings over a number of weeks,
beginning with an initial ses-
sion held in December by all
five bargaining units at Bing-
ham Canyon—Mine-Mill, IAM,
IBEW, BLF&E and Operating
Engineers.

Main concern of the delegates
there was a better approach to
Kennecott bargaining than what
occurred in 1961 Utah negotia-

 

 

tions when the IBEW unit
struck at Bingham Canyon for
21 days after all other unions
had reached agreement with
the company.

Outcome of the Bingham
Canyon meeting was the calling
of an enlarged gathering at the
Mine-Mill Magna Local 392 ha_ll
on Jan. 5 which was attended by

delegates representing about a

dozen bargaining units in Ken-
necott’s Utah mining and mill-
ing operations. These included

Mine-Mill, IAM, IBEW, Operat-

ing Engineers, Clerical Work-
ers, R a i lav a y Brotherhoods
(both high and low lines) and
the System Federation which
bargains for all Railway crafts
maintenance employees.

DISCUSSED at the Jan. 5
meeting was the. necessity of

united negotiations to prevent
Kennecott from playing one

EXPLORATORY meetings for
a similar united bargaining ap-
proach have been held by Mine-
