Statement:
the Boston Eight

We, the Boston Eight, claim responsibility for the destruction of draft
files at Jamaica Plain, Dudley, Uphams Corner and Copley Square in Boston on
November 7. Through this offence to good taste and to law and order we make
ourselves responsible for our lives and for the lives of our brothers.

We destroy some of these files today in Washington because we believe that
the Peace Movement must seriously consider its responsibility to MOVE. We, as
you, have marched, written letters, conferred with officialdom, spoken against
the war, capitalist materialism, and military control. Mr. Nixon responded to
our and your pleas in his November 3 speech, and we responded to these same
pleas in Boston on November 7. If you feel as we do that marching and
demonstrating are unproductive, we encourage you to take responsible action
to secure peace and to end injustice.

We have fashioned hope with our bodies, as free people must do. We oppose
with our lives genocide in Viet Nam and the arms race, exploitative investment
abroad, rape of foreign manpower and resources, domestic racism, environmental
ruin, and militarism in any form-â€”Selective Service, lottery, or volunteer army.

We attack Selective Service because it illustrates the powerlessness of

all Americans, as well as the arrogance of power. It is to return control to
the one, and to check the other, that we have acted. We believe that it will

be impossible to reconstruct the draft records in Boston. All 1-A and l-Y

files were destroyed, as were files for resisters, delinquents, non-registrants.
Chronological ledgers, alphabetical cross reference systems and minutes of draft
board meetings were also destroyed.

Our action demonstrates that non-violent civil disobedience can effectively
halt injustice. To us, such action is a profound moral and political duty,l
necessary to exalt life and secure peace. To these ends we deplore terroristic
attacks which endanger life and engender fear. a

Peace,

William Au
