by the daily din of the "newspapers would fully understand
that victory comes only through battle.

THE FULL MOBILIZATION OF OUR ALLIES

Consequent upon the complete agreement on the scope
and timing of the main military forces of -the three great

Allies, there has ﬁnally been started the process of mobilizing _

our other allies for the struggle as a joint task of the coali-

tion. The line of policy this takes is exempliﬁed by the

Mos-cow Conference Declarations on Austria and Italy, and
by the current steps being taken in support of the Govern-
ment of Marshal Tito and Ivan Ribar in Yugoslavia. ’

I will not repeat here the extended discussions in which we

‘have engaged on these questions during the past year and a

half. They have been rather fully reported in our own press.
How fully correct we -were throughout the whole discussion
has been established by 'events. It is only unfortunate that
so few of those who now see the truth about Yugoslavia are
yet aware that it was theideadly anti-Communist prejudice
which blinded them for so long.

There is excessive delay in putting into application the
policy laid down on Italy. This delay is costly in a military
sense, causing the loss of many additional American lives.
In my recent speech in Cooper U-nion I‘ pointed out that the

I anti-Communist prejudice of the Antonini—Pope gang, exerted

upon ‘Charles Poletti (ranking American officer in AMG),
was doubtless responsible for this delay. In the interests of
the balanced view, I must now add that Mr. Poletti is not the
highest oﬂicial in AMG in Italy, that his chief is a Britisher,
Lord Rennell of Rodd. ‘ ,

It is of more -than passing interest to learn that this Lord
Rennell of ‘Rodd, who is primarily responsible for the sorry
record of AMG in Italy, has the most intimate connection with
the old Cliveden Set and the Oxford Movement of pro-
Hitler notoriety. His,son is married to Nancy Freeman-Mit-

ford, whose sister Unity Freeman-Mitford emigrated to Ger- "

\ many to live near "her idol, Hitler, and who shot herself when
she was discarded by Der Fuehrer. A second sister is -the wife
of Sir Oswald Mosley, the head of British fascism, whose re-
cent release from conﬁnement raised such a storm in England.
This Lord Rennell is very close with the Polish anti-Soviet
circles in London. The ardor of this whole circle in the war
against Hitler is to be measured by their current slogan:
“Nazism is only a pale copy of Bolshevism.” A
' Clearly, with such men in position to determine the appli-
cation of policy, we will not succeed in mobilizing our allies
and potential allies in Europe. In every country of_Europe
the mobilizationof thepeople against Hitlerism requires the
united front that includes the Communists, on -the model of _
the Yugoslav Liberation Army and Government. Men like
Lord Rennell of Rodd, who require smelling-salts to keep
from swooning when the word Communist is mentioned in
their presence, are entirely incapable of applying the policies A
of -the Moscow and Teheran Conferences.

The speed with which the Yugoslav situation is being clari-
ﬁed in these days should serve to give us hope that the same
sort of progress will be made everywhere. The Cliveden Set

‘ ‘ ‘Lords and the Antonini-Pope groups in America cannot for

long hold back the full application of the principles em- _

bodied in the Teheran Conference, which alone will mobilize
our ‘allies for the full wa-r against Hitlerism.

‘In the declaration of the -Cairo Conference, signed by
Roosevelt, Churchill and Chiang Kai—shek, is a very compre-
hensive outline of the military goal against Japan, and of
China’s place in the post-war world. This is of basic im-
portance, and goes far toward laying the ground for an
Asiatic political strategy paralleling that for Europe. There
is still no oﬂicial intimation, however, -that any direct help
has been olfered to solve the inner -crisis in China,- which
threatens heavy disasters to the Allied cause in the Far
‘East. ‘ .

How deep and threatening is the crisis within China is re-
vealed for the ﬁrst time in the documents published in the
current issue of The Communist. Our traditional diplomacy
has caused this to be covered up by the war censorship, and

9

 

 

the only way we are meeting a dire menace to American lives

is the ostrich policy of sticking our heads in the sand. (In-
cidentally, i-t is denied by authorities that even the ostrich is
so stupid as to meet a menace by covering his eyes; that story
was invented by men who did not like humanity to present
the only example of such stupidity.) I have for years been
calling public attention to this sore spot in the Far East.
Such able persons as Edgar Snow, Agnes Smedley and Major

[now Lieutenant—Colonel] Carlson have thrown muchr

light on it in many books of general circulation. The
time has passed when this matter can be allowed to drift
further toward disaster. It is the clear duty of the United
States Government to establish consular and military repre-
sentation in the China Northwest Autonomous Border Re-
gions, whose armies are carrying half the military burden
of the war against Japan on Chinese territory; to insure
that a proportionate share of American lend-lease aid
reaches those armies; and to undertake, in the spir.’it of
the Atlantic Charter, to assist the Chungking regime to avert
the menace of civil war in China.

It is a danger signal that at the moment when the Axis
was being held or driven back with huge losses, in Asia and
Europe, that it could make two bold advances in the Western
Hemisphere. The Ramirez military dictatorship in Argentina
has now been followed by a similarly-inspired and organized

coup in Bolivia. It is further known that agents of the Boliv- L

ian pro-fascist military conspiracy which has seized power
there, were long working within agencies of the United States
Government, and enjoyed the conﬁdence of the highest circles
in this country. All they had to do, to gain entrance into the
most conﬁdential official circles, was to demonstrate their
anti-Communist prejudices. At the same time powerful forces
in the U. S. are openly instigating and backing up the Sinar-
quist movement in Mexico, an anti-United Nations and pro-

Axis movement, without rebu-ke or hindrance from the gov-.

ernment. The U. S. foreign services are honeycombed with
Trotskyites, every one of whom is an actual or potential
agent of Hitler. Thus we see danger arising in relation to
Latin America similar to that in China.

VICTORY OVER HITL_ER IN 

General Eisenhower, ‘Commander of the Anglo-American
forces for the coming invasion of Western Europe, has given
the official military perspective for victory over Hitlerism in
this year of 1944. *

The gigantic victories already won by the Red Armies, the

heroic exploits -of Marshal Tito’s forces in the Mediterranean,”
the breaking of the U-boat blockade in the Atlantic, and the

overwhelming accumulations of war materials in America and
-England, all serve to create a setting in which the Anglo-
American ofﬁcers and» men can very soberly and realistically
set the goal of victory for this year.

Military forces can carry out even the most realistic plans,
however, only if they are solidly backed up by the home
front in each country, and if the coalition of nations is
welded solidly together.

There remain serious dangers on these ﬁelds, to which 1
next propose to direct our attention.

II. "THE EXTENSION OF THE COALITION UNITY
A INTO THE POST-WAR PERIOD

CHURCHILL, Stalin and Roosevelt in Teheran expressed
‘the determination to “work together in the war and in
the peace that will follow.” a’

Dealing with the war and the peace thus in a single sentence
was surely not accidental. It reﬂected the insuperable difficul-
ties in waging a joint war without having a joint perspective
for the peace to follow, and the impossibility of any perspec-
tive for a longpeace unless the war is jointly fought and
jointly won. .

Both phases of this declaration must be taken with equal
seriousness. We cannot accept one and reject the other. They
stand together in their very nature, like Siamese twins who,
if severed, are in the gravest danger of immediate death.

When Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt can say they “have

A surveyed the problems of the future,” and that they “are sure

that our concord will make it an cnduring_peace”'; when they
hold out awperspective of a future which will “banish the
scourge and terror of war for many generations”—then we
may be sure that these three men have found a path to which,
as realists, they expect to win not only the great majority of
their own people, but the “overwhelming masses of the peoples
of the world.” They were not playing with diplomatic phrases.
They were projecting a practical policy. (

The difficulties which stood in the way of such agreement
are not secrets. The whole thinking world knows what they
were. And knowing this, we can begin to formulate for our-
selves on a much more extensive scale than the official com-
muniqués give us, the nature of the common policy, the “con-
cord,” which was begun in Teheran.

Not so widely appreciated as the difﬁculties, there was opera-
tive in Teheran a motive .for agreement for the post—war period
equally as forceful as the motive for agreement on the joint
war.

12

 

 

Where the over-riding consideration for a joint coalition

war against Hitlerism is the alternative of a Hitler—dominated
world, which means the extinguishing of civilization for gen-
erations to come, it must be recognized that for the coalition
peace, after Hitlerism has been destroyed, there is the .equally

‘ strong motive that without it the alternative is the spread of

civil wars over vast areas, culminating ﬁnally and inevitably
in a new world war between nations.

Those who have said, lightheartedly, that it was Hitler who
forced the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition but as soon as
Hitler is gone the coalition will ﬂy apartovernight, were but
shallow thinkers who underestimated the depth of the world
crisis through which we live. Likewise they underestimated
the amount of effective intelligence that has been achieved
by mankind. Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill at Teheran were
the representatives of the collective intelligence of mankind
facing the threatening supreme catastrophe of history and de-
termined to avert it.

‘What were the diﬂiculties in the way of concord?

First, there were the differences between the socialist and
capitalist sectors of the anti-Hitler coalition. Each side of
this line of demarkation clearly would be happier if the
rest of the world were shaped more nearly in its own image.
The ruling circles in Britain and America have grown up in
an atmosphere of shuddering fear and abhorence of the so-
cialist revolution embodied in the Soviet Union, and every-
thing even remotely associated in their minds with it. It
was this ‘deep and unreasoning fear, indeed, which brought
about the Munich policy that raised Hitler to power, and
brought Britain and America to the brink of destruction-
a measure of how powerfully it operated. The Soviet Union,
for its part, had the sharp memory of universal hostility from
the capitalist world, armed invasions to overthrow it, long-
continued conspiracies to undermine it from within, and

ﬁnally the Munich incitement of Hitler to his invasion which

ﬁnally came in June, 1941.

These old hostilities and suspicions had to be overcome as
the. precondition for the Teheran concord.

Britishand American ruling circles had to be convinced
that their joint war together with the Soviet Union against

13

 

\

\

Hitle'rism would not result in the Soviet socialist system be-

ing extended to Western Europe under the stimulus of the

victorious Red Armies. The men who determine Soviet policy
had to be convinced that Western capitalist circles had ﬁnally
learned that the Soviet Union is in this world to stay, and
that hostility to it can only bring disaster to themselves as
well as the rest of the world. Upon this basis, both sides could
then come to an agreement as to how all particular problems
should be solved by conference, conciliation and agreement,
without either immediate or ultimate resort to the arbitrament
of war. .

Clearly, when Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill registered
such basic agreement in Teheran, they were registering not
alone their own personal convictions, but spoke for a growing

majority in their own countries, as well as the rest of the‘

world.
Capitalism and socialism have begun to ﬁnd the way to
peaceful co—existence and collaboration in the same world.
Such general agreement necessarily must show itself prac-

tically, not alone in the conduct of the military struggle, but

in beginning to shape the post-war world which will emerge

from it. Such agreement begins "to take its form in the ex--

amples of Italy and Yugoslavia, It preserves for the war
period the basic principle of private property, the basis of
capitalism( and thus relieves the fears of British and American
ruling circles; it frees the forces of the democratic peoples’
revolution, and sweeps away all forms of absolutism, thus
relieving the anxiety of Soviet statesmen of a possible re-
emergence of the old anti-Soviet forces. It preserves to each
nation the ultimate right to determine for itself, within this
framework, the f-orm of government and social organization
it desires, without any outside pressure. ‘ /
This broad over-all joint policy in relation to Europe car-

ries with it the duty jointly to exert all influence to minimize

and if possible to eliminate the use of violent struggle for
the settlement of inner problems, except in the defeat of the
Axis forces and their Quislings. A broad all-inclusive anti-
fascist democratic camp must be established in each country,
within which all relations are determined and problems

14

 

 

, I \ \
settled by ‘free discussion, free political association and uni-
versal suffrage. Such a democratic camp of necessity must in-

\ clude the Communists, and this must be_ emphasized because

/

in America it is still disputed even by many who call them-.

selves “advanced liberals.” . . . '

An essential part of the whole program of a peaceful post-
war world is the achievement of international labor unity.
The British Trades Union Congress has taken an initiative to
this end, in the call for an international congress of labor
to be held in London in June. The overwhelminggmajority
of labor movements of the United Nations has approved this

call. Only the leadership of the American Federation of Labor,“

through Matthew Woll, has come out against it. W011 and
his friends have been properly rebuked by the. chief spokes-
men of British labor. It is to be hoped that the intelligent and
patriotic majority of the A. F. of L. leadership, who will cer-
tainly receive the support of the bulk of the membership if
they speak up, will force a change of attitude upon their
dominant reactionary leaders. The Soviet trade unions cannot
possibly any longer be excluded from the international labor
movement. M7011 is attempting his King Canute role too late

in history for any sucdess. He can only bring isolation upon S

the A. F. of L; and not upon the Soviet trade unions. / e V
Such is the main outline of the social and political content
of the joint policy upon which is based the realistic promise
of a post—war worldin which Anglo-Soviet-American coopera-
tion will be continuing and which will organize the family
of free, peace-loving, democratic nations of the world.
This is a policy which corresponds to the national interest

of all peoples, great and small.~There is no workable alterna-7 I

tive to this policy, only the alternative of international an-
archy. S

This is the supreme issue before the world today."

For or against the Declaration of the Teheran Conference’

is _the issue that separates the sheep from the goats, that de-
termines all political. alignments from now on until the poli-
cies there enunciated have ‘been fully‘ realized! in war and
peace. It is the a.ll—dominating issue in the United States in
the 1944 Presidential elections. '

III. NATIONAL UNITY IN THE WAR AND
POST-WAR PERIODS

ATIONAL unity in America for the successful prosecu-
N tion of the war is being most seriously threatened pre-
cisely at the moment it is most needed, at the time the‘ supreme
blow is being poised by the Anglo—American forces in the
invasion of Western Europe in force. Right at this moment
there has been released a ﬂood of inner strife"in the country,
ranging from race riots, to strike provocations, to open de-
featist agitation, to the most irresponsible campaigning for the
1944 elections.

The weakest point in our wartime national unity is the
widespread belief that it will inevitably, at the moment of
victory over Hitler, explode in a simultaneous release of all
the inner conflicts that have been held in abeyance by the
war. The lack of any clear perspective of national unity in

the post-war period thus serves to put the greatest strains
L upon wartime national unity. This is especially true when the

country is authoritatively told that victory will come in 1944,
that is, that the lid will be removed from all inner strife in the
next months; nearly everyone, even if they are opposed to
this perspective, begins to feel a compulsion to prepare, to

’ get set for the outburst of every sort of class, sectional, group

and individual conﬂict that has been postponed in considera-
tion of the war. This situation furnishes the opportunity for
the dangerous work of the secret friends an-d agents of. Hitler
within the United States.

In anticipation of an early victory, we are thus most seri-
ously endangering that victory.

It would be the greatest single contribution to wartime na-
tional unity, therefore, if we could seriously establish the
prospect that this unity will be continued in the post-war
period, that it will not explode into a chaos of inner struggles
at the moment war hostilities cease.

Further, this expectation of unlimited inner conﬂict threat- .

16

 

 

ens to destroy also the perspective of international unity held
forth at Teheran. If we wish to uphold and realize the Teheran
perspective, we must ﬁnd the way to minimize, and to place
deﬁnite’ limits upon, the settlement of inner differences in the
country by conﬂict in the post-war period. The perspective
of inner chaos within the United States is incompatible with
the perspective of international order. .

‘These two basic considerations are sufficient to establish the
supreme responsibility upon all who support the Teheran
policy, to work for such policies within the‘ country that will
lead toward, and give realistic promise of, the continuation
of national unity into the post-war period for a long term of
years.

This is admittedly a goal difficult of attainment. There is
a growing accumulation within our country of strains, contra-
dictions, conﬂicts, antagonisms and unsolved problems of all
sorts, which in the absence of clear policy directed toward
their control and amelioration—a policy with an effective
majority of the country ﬁrmly united in its support—will
surely cancel the Teheran perspective and bring us again face
to face with disaster.

We must face all these diﬂiculties frankly and with full

realism. Wishful thinking and illusions will not help us
through this grave period of history.

yBut we must face the difﬁculties with the full determina-
tion to overcome them. We cannot tolerate today the slightest
tendency toward defeatism, hopelessness, and fatalism.

Everything necessary to win the war in the quickest pos-
sible time, and to establish a stable peace—that is, to realize
the perspectives of Teheran—must and will be done. Since
this includes ﬁrst of all the consolidation of national unity
in our country, and its extension into the post-war period——
this also must and will be accomplished.

‘POST-WAR PLANNING AND NATIONAL UNITY

In the summer of 1942, I wrote on behalf of our party, in
my book Vict0ry—and A fter, the following regarding post-war
planning: ‘

. 17

   

“Victory for the United Nations over the Axis will bring
us face to face with the problems of the post-war reorganiza-
tion of the world. Many persons and organizations are busily
preparing blueprints in anticipation of that day. That is a
pastime in which I cannot join. I have no blueprints for the
post-war world.”

That position remains valid today.

Our post-war plan is national unity for the realization of
the perspectives laid down in Teheran.

National unity in the United States cannot be built upon.
preconceived plans, because it must be a compromise between
classes, groups and tendencies which have not agreed on the
shape of a plan, and which can only agree as their unity in ac-
tion takes shape step by step.

Those who are enamored of planning for its own sake are
sorely displeased with this approach. They join with en-
thusiasm in the fashionable avocation of post-war planning.
They insist that we must keep up with the Joneses. If the
good wife has not a new hat a la mode, she simply feels naked.
So with our post-war planners. _ V

A plan for the United States can be helpful, however, only
when it has been demonstrated that it can serve the unity of
an effective majority of the American people directing our
country’s policy on the lines of the Teheran Conference.

The greatest danger facing our country is a welter and
confusion of plans among the democratic and progressive

forces, while the reactionaries will be united on the single

“plan" to get power in their hands and switch the nation
off the rails of Teheran.

It will be necessary for us to be very harsh and unyielding
to this insistent demand for post-war plans on our part. We
must put a few questions, and demand clear answers to them
from all who aspire to make plans for America.

The first question is, what kind of America are the plans
for, a socialist or a capitalist America? ‘

No one can suspect me of holding any prejudices in favor
of capitalism, whether in America or elsewhere. I have been
an advocate of socialism during all of my adult life, of so-

cialism for America. The Communist Party is the only party
of socialism in this country. But I have not the slightest
hesitation in declaring that any plans for American post-war

reconstruction which are based upon the introduction of so-.

cialism are in effect a repudiation of the aim to unite the
majority of the nation behind the Teheran policies.

It is my considered judgment that the American people are
so ill—prepared, subjectively, for any deep-going change in the
direction of socialism that post-war plans with such an aim
would not unite the nation, but would further divide it. And
they would divide and weaken precisely the democratic and
progressive camp, while they would unite and strengthen the
most reactionary forces in the country. In their practical

‘ effect, they would help the anti-Teheran forces to come to

power in the United States. ,

If the national unity of the war-period is to be extended
and even strengthened in the post-war period, then we -must
recognize that in the United States this requires from the
Marxists the reafﬁrmation of our wartime policy that we will
not raise the issue of socialism in such a form and manner as
to endanger or weaken that national unity.

This is not a new issue for us. Already in the middle of
1942, I wrote: .

“The United States, if it successfully meets the cruel tests
of this war and contributes its share to the victory, will almost
certainly enter the post-war world as the strongest capitalist

country and the political center of gravity of the capitalist

sector of the world. It will have an enormously important
role to play, therefore, in the family of nations. \ .

“The central problem of this post-war world will be that of
whether or not the collaboration set up for the war, in the
United Nations, can be continued and extended after the
war to deal collectively with the problems of economic and po-
litical reconstruction of the world. Upon the answer to this
question depends all further determination of the character
of the ost—war world. ‘

“If t e United Nations as a center of world collaboration
can be continued and extended it is possible to hold out the
realistic perspective of a ra id healing of the terrible wounds

of thewar, and great strides forward in attaining for all

19

' "  ..e~..'.»~..,..a......-....-..¢.. ;. ...~

 ‘. .

 

peoples those goals of cultural and economic advancement in-

 

dicated in outline in the Atlantic Charter. It will then be,

possible to minimize those upheavals and civil wars which
are generated in the course of the international war and which
tend to break out on its termination; it will be possible to ﬁnd
a maximum degree of peaceful and orderly development for
all nations.” (Victory—/Ind After, p. 251).

This possible perspective is the one which was conﬁrmed
at Teheran. If we believe it is realistic and possible—and we

have now the signatures of Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin,

and Franklin D. Roosevelt to it——then all our plans will be
directed toward making it work.
In the United States, whatever may be the situation in other

lands, this means a— post-war perspective of the reconstruction

of capitalism, not of the transition to socialism.

We can set our goal as the realization of the Teheran policy,
or we can set ourselves the task of pushing the United States
immediately into socialism. Clearly, however, we cannot
choose both.

The first policy, ‘with all its diﬂiculties, is deﬁnitely within
the realm of possible achievement. The second ‘would be

p dubious, indeed, especially when we remember that even the

most progressive section of the labor movement is com-
mitted to capitalism, is not even as vaguely socialistic as the
British Labor Party. -

Therefore, the policy for Marxists in the United States is to
face with all its consequences the perspective of a capitalist
post-war reconstruction in the United States, to evaluate all
plans on that basis, and to collaborate actively with the most
democratic and progressive majority in the country, in a na-
tional unity suﬂiciently broad and effective to realize the poli-
cies of Teheran.

“FREE ENTERPRISE" AND CAPITALISM

The most reactionary and pro-fascist circles in the U.S. have
taken up, the banner of “Free Enterprise” in their bid for
power in the 1944 elections. They hope thereby to throw con-
fusion into the democratic—progressive camp, most of which is

alsorcommitted to “free enterprise” as a synonym of capitalism. ‘

20

Marxists will not help the reactionaries, by opposing the

slogan of “Free Enterprise” with any form of counter-slogan. v

If anyone wishes to describe the existing system of capitalism
in the United States as “free enterprise,” that is all right
with us, and we fra_nkly declare that we are ready to cooperate
in making this capitalism work effectively in the post-war
period with the_least possible burdens upon the people. We
do not in any degree draw political lines of division for the
1944 elections on any form of the issue of “free enterprise.”

It is particularly confusing, and, therefore, helpful to the
reactionaries to pose the issue before the country as “the

Roosevelt policies versus Free Enterprise.” That is to obscure \

the central fact that all Roosevelt’s policies have been designed
for the preservation of capitalism (“free enterprise”), have
in fact strengthened capitalism, whereas the policies of his
reactionary opponents would have brought capitalism very
quickly into as deep a crisis as that of Hoover's administration.

There has never been anything of socialism in Roosevelt’s
policies and every suggestion to the contrary, no matter from
whence it comes, serves only to falsify the problem and con-
fuse the issues.

As a matter of fact, Roosevelt’s policies have involved but a
minimum of governmental intervention in economic matters
(state capitalism), that minimum requisite to surmount ma-
jor crises, and have never posed these measures other than as
“unfortunate necessities.” In other words, Roosevelt is not
even “state capitalist” in any programmatic sense, but, on the
contrary, is “free enterprise capitalist” even as that slogan
expresses opposition to the higher forms of capitalism, and
not only opposition to socialism. ‘

It is very illuminating to note that the British Tory circles,
which have of dire necessity adopted a large measure of state
capitalism as a long-time policy, go far beyond any measures

"even remotely suggested by Roosevelt. Mr. Eric Johnson,

president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and among the
most vociferous champions of “free enterprise,” on his recent
visit to England, found himself in much sharper opposition to
the British big business men than he has been to Roosevelt,
so far as programmatic questions are concerned. Mr. Johnson,
21

F

   

“‘  .:«~»- _

 

 
   

 

in fact, seems to look upon British Tories as wild Bolsheviks.

Even under the terriﬁc pressure of war, Mr. Roosevelt has
refused toyapply those measures of state capitalism clearly
needed for the maximum economic mobilization, and called
for by the most far-seeing representatives of American capi-
talism (in the Tolan-Kilgore-Pepper bills‘ for war economy)“.

’He preferred to leave most of the problems in this ﬁeld to

“private enterprise,” which in effect meant to leave them
to the decisions of the ten biggest monopolies.

In view of Roosevelt’s inability to secure Congressional sup-
port even for his mild “seven—point program” against inﬂation,
the failure of which is chieﬂy responsible for the current do-
mestic labor crisis, one cannot say with any ﬁnality that his
refusal to support the Tolan-Kilgore-Pepper measure was a

‘mistake. Perhaps he knew better than we did of the dangers

of capitalist disaffection” from the war effort if their preju-
dices were thus challenged even in their own interests!

g It is clear that even a program of state capitalism will be
resisted desperately by powerful circles in America. Such
elementary measures as nationalization of banks, railroads,
coal and steel, would obviously make American capitalist‘-
economy” much stronger and more capable of solving its prob-
lems. A program calling for such measures would not, how-
ever, have even the united support of the labor movement, and
much less of the middle and upper bourgeoisie, in the 1944.

elections. Therefore, we cannot expect any such program as ’
the vehicle of the broad democratic-progressive camp in the

-1944 elections.
The issue of “free enterprise” is thus not in any way, shape
or form the issue of the coming struggle for control of United

States policy in the Congressional and Presidential elections.

MONOPOLY AND “FREE ENTERPRISE”

If it~is true, as I maintain, that the democratic-progressive
majority in the country cannot be united and crystallized ef-
fectively on the basis of a“ programmatic refutation of “free
enterprise,” then it is equally true that this ‘cannot, be accom-
plished around the slogan of anti-monopoly and anti-big
capital as a.whole as the‘ enemy
22 - A

business, by dealing with big

 

 

 

and demanding its power be drastically curbed and eventually
broken. A ‘

American capitalism is monopoly capitalism. After this
war that condition will be much more accentuated. The con-
version of American industry to war purposes has enormously.
strengthened the position of the large centralized aggregations
of private capital, which constitute monopoly, within the na-3
tional economy as a whole. Today, to speak seriously of dras-
tic curbs on monopoly capital, leading toward the. breaking -
of its power, and imposed upon monopoly capital against its
will, is merely another form of proposing the immediate transi-
tion to socialism—or else it is the Utopian trust-busting pro-
gram of return to an earlier, pre-monopoly stage of capitalism.
/ National unity around a program to break the power of :
monopoly capital is possible only if and when the majority
of the people can be united for the institution of socialism
in the United States. _ ‘

That time is not now, and certainly not in the 1944 elec-
tions. A r

Certainly, the unrestricted play of the inherent tendencies

‘of monopoly capital has disastrous results which must be pre-
vented, and small business must be protected, aided and
given a chance to develop. But the necessary restrictions upon
monopoly will, of necessity, be of a sort which will be ap-
proved by the overwhelming majority and adopted with the
agreement and collaboration of at least a signiﬁcant and de-
cisive part of the capitalist class itself, of the big capitalists,

understand that unrestricted abuses are dangerous to their
whole system. '

Marxists should be the last persons in the world to deceive
fthemselves with windy rhetoric in the style of Norman
Thomas. . ‘ t A .

When we Marxists speak of breaking the power of monop-
oly capital; we mean to put another power in its place. That
can only be the power of the working class united upon a pro-
gram of socialism. When we do not have such serious and
realistic perspectives, we do not console ourselves with sohor-
ous revolutionary-sounding phrases which have no practical

meaning except that they transport us into a puerile dream-
world and remove our inﬂuence from the world of reality.
Let us therefore not talk about breaking monopoly capital
as the program for national unity in this United States in the

year of 1944! -
IS NIONOPOLY CAPITAL “oNE REACTIONARY MASS”?

There has been some very sharp objection taken to a point
in my speech in Bridgeport on December 12. Allow me to
quote the paragraph in question and discuss the problem
involved somewhat more deeply. I said:

“We shall have to be prepared to break with anyone
that refuses to support and ﬁght for the realization of the Tehe-
ran Agreement and the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition. We
must be prepared to give the hand of cooperation and fel-
lowship to everyone who ﬁghts for the realization of this coali-
tion. If J. P. Morgan supports this coalition and goes down
the line for it, I as a Communist am prepared to clasp his
hand and join with him to realize ‘it. Class divisions or po-
litical groupings have no signiﬁcance now except as they re-
flect one side or the other side of this issue.”

In order that we waste no time in quibbling, I now make ex-
plicit what is inherent in the thought expressed, namely, that
I was not making a verbal abolition of class differences, but
that I was rejecting the political slogan of “class against class”
as our guide to political alignments in the next period. I
spoke of Mr. Morgan symbolically as the representative of a
class, and not as an individual—-in which capacity I know him
not at all.

In my opinion this is the only correct approach to the po-
litical alignments within the United States. We will choose
our associates ﬁrst and ‘above all according to whether they
are for or against the Teheran policy, and the effectiveness of
their ‘support, regardless of class differences or past political
divisions.

This approach assumes that not only workers, farmers and
middle classes are the supporters of Teheran,’ but also among

24

 

 

the big bourgeoisie, the monopoly capitalists, there are those
who will be our allies.

Suchan approach is correct even if it should turn out that
we -ﬁnd no allies there. For if there should be no such allies,
let that fact be established without any confusions about the
threat of Communist hostility having driven the poor fellows
into their reactionary stand. But above all, it is correct be-
cause doubtless, as a practical matter, there will be and are
strong supporters in the ranks of the greatest capitalists for the
Anglo-Soviet-American coalition as a long-time project, as out-
lined at Teheran. Even the monopoly capitalists are not one
reactionary mass today. .

I have been challenged to produce a list of the big capitalists

/ on either side of the issue, and evaluate their relative weight a

in political matters. I have no such lists, nor can I make my
political judgments on such a basis. Of one thing I"am sure:
That part of the big bourgeoisie which supports Teheran
can be the decisive part—provided it joins effectively with the
whole democratic-progressive camp.

The policy of supporters of Teheran must be to seek and
facilitate support from all classes and groups with the working
people as the main base, from the big bourgeoisie to the
Communists. The whole camp of supporters of Teheran must
organize themselves effectively as the controlling majority of
the country.

Without such a broad and all-inclusive approach, it is idle
chatter to speak of winning the vast majority of the United
States to the Teheran policies. ‘

TOWARD AN ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR NATIONAL UNITY

While we cannot invent programs, it is possible to begin
to examine the approach to the common path of dealing with
economic problems, on the basis of unity of different classes.

Such an economic program must be designed to win a max-
imum of agreement, and rouse a minimum of opposition,
‘from at least the two most decisive groups; ﬁrst, the business
men, industrial and ﬁnancial capitalists and their managers",
who have effective direction of the nation’s economy; and
.-second, the working classes, organized labor and the farmer.

my One idea seems to have crystalized in both these two main

 groups, and this is the impossibility that our nation be per-
i mitted, when the war ends, to plunge into a new economic
crisis. Not even the most reactionary capitalist organizations
are willing nowadays to subscribe to the dismal prediction
made by the American Academy of Political and Social Science
(Annals, March, 1942), which described the post-war economic
situation in these words: ’

“The national income will drop almost overnight to one-
, third or one-half of its war peak. . . . There will be cor-
'  A responding unemployment. . . . Any plan that fails to accept
i‘ these facts is unrealistic and futile.”

H On the contrary, on all sides there is general agreement
that the marvelous expansion of American productive economy
to meet. the war needs has proved, beyond question, that ’there
, is no valid reason why the same economy, including agricul-A
W1 _ ture, should not produce for peace-time needs at approxi- -
A mately the same level, and that no plan is worth considering
: that proceeds from any other basis. A L A

ll The Committee for Economic Development, a special in-
ii ‘ stitution set up by “business leaders and corporation ofﬁcers”
L to study post-war problems, sets forth the problem in the
 following terms:

 

“The problem, as the Committee sees it, is ﬁrst of all to
make the «transition from war to peaceful economic activity.
When peace comes, the government will no longer be in the

y ' market for 85 billion dollars worth of war goods which it is

E {l spending in 1.943. A minimum of‘seven million men in the

 zg; armed services and most of the 20 million persons now in the
1

 

war industries will be eager for productive work in peace-
: time pursuits. To provide employment to these millions of
j men and women, it will be necessary to offset quickly the
 billions of dollars of war production with an equivalent out-
‘ “ put of peacetime goods and services. Approximately an out-
l « put of 135 to 150 billion dollars (at 1941 prices) will .be re-
  i quired. This output must be reached quickly’——at most within
1

two ‘years after peace comes—and employment must be in-—
26 V

\.

 

creased by half a million jobs per year in subsequent years’
to take care of normal increases in available manpower”
(summarized by Lewis L. Lorwin, Post-war Plans of the
United Nations, N. Y., 1943, pp. 27-28).

Whence will come the markets for an additional 85 billions
of peace-time goods after the war?‘ Clearly a large part of it,
perhaps as much as a half, must under our economic system
be foreign markets. -

The Teheran Conference, for the ﬁrst time, gave a realistic

perspective‘ of the quick organization of such huge foreign“
.markets. Such huge foreign markets are unthinkable except

under stable conditions, without international or civil wars
of major proportions. Without such foreign markets there is
no possibility to ﬁnd an economic foundation to the national
unity within the United States. i ~. ‘

Most capitalist circles are vehemently opposed to large
scale government intervention in economic matters. Yet even
on this point dogmatic attitudes are being broken down.
Thus the Post-War Problem Committee of the National As-

sociation of Manufacturers begins to face the huge problem '

of organizing the foreign market ant. “strikes a new note.”

“It suggests that ‘some frame-work should be established

. through which the political and economic relationships be-

tween nations of the world can be developed and maintained

l on an orderly basis.’ While free enterprise is the rule of our

country, the committee states, it does not follow that free
enterprise will necessarily be the rule in the countries where
great developments are likely to take place. But whether capi-
tal funds for the improvement ..of undeveloped countries
should be made available through private enterprise origove
ernmental action, ‘adequate agencies should be established
to insure that they are administered with due regard for
whatever obligations are incurred in making them available.”
(Lorwin, op. cit., p. 23.)

Obviously, there will be no unbridgeable differences‘ of
opinion on the government's role in realizing the huge foreign
markets that are a-bsolutely necessary to keep American in.-

-dustry/and agriculture operating. We can with’ good con-
science agree that the government should go no further in
this direction than the export-capitalists themselves demand
in the interest of really getting the orders and obtaining pay-
ment therefor!

As to the expansion of the domestic market, this will be a
subject of much sharper dispute. Assuming that domestic
and foreign markets go ﬁfty-ﬁfty in absorbing the additional
eighty—five billion dollar new peace-time commodities, this
means approximately doubling the present domestic market.
It is clear the ordinary channels of industrial expansion (utili-
zation of the ‘twenty-four billion dollar A-deferred icivilian
spending represented in war bonds, public works, home con-
struction, roadbuilding, etc.) cannot by any means make up
even the larger part of this amount; nor can new capital in-
vestment in productive plant, which would call for an even
greater expansion of the productive plan! Some extraordinary
means must be found to double the buying capacity of the
domestic market, and there seems no other way but to double
the buying power of the individual consumer. How that shall
be done we will not suggest at this time. We look forward to
practical suggestions from the capitalists who must ﬁnd the
solution in order to keep their plants operating.

As to the degree of governmental intervention in guaran-
teeing full employment and production, this most disputed
point of all must be resolved somewhat along the lines of
agreement that it shall be limited to that margin by which
private enterprise fails to measure up to the standard of
one hundred and ﬁfty billion dollars annual national income,
or thereabout.

Only the Teheran conference gives the promise, if its policies
are applied fully, to realize such an economic program of na-
tional unity. It is an unprecedented and diﬂicult effort. But
the stakes are great indeed. It is worth the effort to realize it.
We Communists are opposed to permitting an explosion of
class conﬂict in our country when the war ends. If it happens
it will not be in any way our responsibility, but that of men

is interest, and who abandoned the nation for private greed.

IV. THE COMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS

IN NOVEMBER of this year the country will be called upon
to choose its Chief Executive for the next four years. The
choice will be between two candidates selected by two nomi-
nating conventions known by the names of Democratic Party
and Republican Party. These are parties only in a formal
and legal sense; they are not parties in the sense of represent-
ing well-deﬁned alternative policies. They arecoalitions of
local and regional interests, diverse tendencies of political
thought, and institutionalized politics, from which national
policy and national interest come forth in a distorted way,
with much confusion, and with a maximum dependence upon
the personality which emerges as leader. It is a peculiarly
American system, without a counterpart anywhere else in the
world. ‘

Who will be the candidate of the Democratic Party? What
policies will his candidacy represent?

There is only one certain point in ﬁnding the answers to
these questions. - That point is that the Democratic Conven-
tion will certainly name Roosevelt again—if he will accept
the nomination. If the President should refuse, there is not
the slightest assurance that the candidate will represent a con-
tinuation of the Roosevelt policies. In fact, it might well be
someone much more closely resembling Senaton Taft—Senator
Byrd, for example. That is a highly irrational situation. But
it is the reality with which we must deal. In the succession
of party leadership there is no assurance of the continuation
of policy; on the contrary, it is almost certain that a change
in the person will represent a change inpolicy. V .

The Republican Party is equally unstable. Wendell Will-
kie is one of its leading possibilities. Yet his nomination is al-
most entirely dependent upon his Democratic opponent being
Roosevelt. The moment that the Republican Convention was

‘ certain Roosevelt was not running, Willkie’s stock would drop

with a dull thud; the Republican delegates would select a
29

   

“regular” machine man, someone like Dewey or Bricker. Will-
kie is desperately trying to overcome this handicap by indulg-
ing in demagogic speeches; he is falling between two stools,
trying to be as much like the President as possible, and at the
same time to appear his opposite. Eventually he will ﬁnd it
necessary to choose which he is to be; he cannot long continue
to be all things to all men.

These facts reveal how s-hadowy is the supposed alternative
of turning from Roosevelt to Wilkie and thereby gain con-
tinuityof policy by change of party.

Even admitting, for the sake of argument (what is becoming
less true every day) that Willkie advocates policies closely re-
sembling Roosevelt's, it still remains true that (1) Willkie
cannot win the Republican nomination if the convention feels
it can elect someone else, which means unless Roosevelt is
running; and (2) Roosevelt cannot be expected to consent to
be a candidate unless he is drafted by an overwhelming de-
mand that will assure his re—election without himself neg-
lecting the war by campaigning. Thus Willkie is out of luck
either way.

It was the widespread recognition of these basic facts‘ which
led a large section of the labor movement already in 1943 to
begin raising the demand that Roosevelt shall‘ be a candidate
in 1944. ‘

The Teheran Conference has deepened and broadened that
demand. Not that its policies are the property of the Demo-
cratic Party. No, they are the property of the nation, and all
who support them can beneﬁt from them. But it is ines-
capable that the man who played such a large part in bring-
ing the Teheran Conference together, and who led in making
it a success, should be identiﬁed in the public mind with -this
greatest of» the nation's achievements. ‘ -

At the plenary meeting of our National Committee last June, »

I. reported that “the main current of thinking in the defeatist
camp turns in the direction of securing a three-way division
of the electoral vote that will deny a majority to any candi-
date, thus throwing the election into the House of Repre-

sentatives, which is controlled by the reactionary coalition ,
. . . splitting the Southern poll-tax states away from Roosevelt

 ., .4

or Roosevelt's candidate, behind a rival Democratic candidate ‘
p named by a rump convention which will keep Roosevelt off

the ballot in the poll—tax states.” L
Interestingly enough, my report of the existence of this plan

received public conﬁrmation, from one of its champions,

a Senator from South Carolina, on the Senate floorponly
a few weeks ago. At the time I spoke of it, this was a secret
but really dangerous conspiracy; but by the time the Senator
raised it openly as a threat it was already a movement
which had ﬁzzled out. No, the South is not going to secede
from the Democratic Party in revenge for the abolition of the

poll-tax, and general discontent with the progressive features _

of Roosevelt’s administration. Even the South has begun to
realize that it cannot live in the past forever, that it must
begin to modernize itself and come into line with the rest of
the country. South Carolina followed its Senators into the
secession that started the Civil War in 1861, but that state
is not going to follow its Senator in a new secession in
1944. No, the poll-taxers will have to look for other ways,
more hidden from the people, to have any hope of getting
away with their dirty work in the coming Presidential elec-
tion.

Of essentially the same practical signiﬁcance was the effort
through 1943 to stampede a section of the labor movement
into a "third party”; the men behind it were motivated by op-
position to the war, the John L. Lewis gang, the Trotskyites,
and the Norman Thomas Socialists. This diversion has also’
beeii squelched by the good sound sense of labor and the able
leadership of Phil Murray and Sidney Hillman.

Now the reactionary and defeatist camp have no tricks
left for the 1944 election, in which they still hope to gain
power, except the ﬁght to control the nominations in one or
both of the major parties. '

If Roosevelt does them the inestimable favor of retiring
from the ﬁeld, then the reactionaries and defeatists have high
‘prospects of controlling the nomination in both parties. In
which case the country is in for a bad time indeed!

If Roosevelt is ﬁnally persuaded by the demands of the peo-
ple, against his own desires, to run again, then the only hope

of the defeatists is in the Republican Party, and even there

they will then be faced with the ﬁgure of Willkie, who is not

entirely their man. . A
These are the main outlines of the 1944 Presidential elec-
tion situation, as we enter the pre-convention period.

GOODBYE TO THE “NEW DEAL” LABEL

The President was expressing the sound strategy of national
unity, when he recently told the press that in his opinion the
label “New Deal” to describe his Administration should be
replaced by something up-to-date like “Win-the-Wain”.

Old Guard Republican spokesman Spangler immediately
rushed into print to prove Roosevelt was correct, by angrily
denouncing his statement, and insisting that the Republican
Party would ﬁght the old battles all over again in 1944, and
that theyrefused to recognize that the world had changed at
all. ‘ V .

The Old Guard Social-Democrats also made this the occa-
sion for widening the breach between them and the Presi-
dent which they have been industriously digging for these
many months. _

The genteel liberals of the New Republic underwent a gen-
teel conniption ﬁt and solemnly declared that never, no never,
could they agree that the Roosevelt Administration should

be called “Win-the-War” instead of “New Deal.”

Otherwise, the country seemed to take the news in its stride,
with merely a grunt of assent. Of course, why not°have t e
labels adjusted to the changed tasks of the times. As the Presi-
dent pointed out, the contents of the “New Deal” period was
a series of twenty-eight measures now well established, and
which the most rabid anti-New Dealers hesitate to challenge-
if they are running for oﬂice. They continue and ’will continue.

But today there are new measures, and they are all bound up A

with winning the war. ~ ,

And if anyone is interested in what the Communists think
of’ the question, it is only necessary to repeat what we said
through our National Committee last June:

“The dominant issue is not Right wing versus Left wing;
, 32

 

-‘;t‘@t§‘V'<‘ «IV;-<‘\‘V . -...‘.....,,~=»

..a.,g- .  vu§u1vx~cc . -~=
. x
y

it is not the New Deal against the Old Deal; it is not the
keeping of the status quo; it is not anything but for victory
and against the defeatists. And in this whole struggle, whether
it be electoral alignments for 1944 or the daily questions of
life today in the development of the war, our friends and our
allies are not determined by any ideological considerations,
or any formal political alignments. We are partners and allies
with every American who is ready to ﬁght the defeatists at
home and prosecute the war to victory at all costs. This is
our political platform today and next year; along that line we
must carry on without deviation.”

WAGE POLICY, STRIKES AND LABOR POLITICAL ACTION

Considerable confusion in the handling of wage policy has
come to the point where the whole subject demands serious
review by the Administration, and elimination of the rigid

. freezing technique modiﬁed only by clumsy case-to-«case ad-

justments with no guiding policy. '

This dogmatic and rigid handling of wage problems has
created an open ﬁeld for the disrupters and provocationists,
who ‘have used their opportunities to the full to stir up dis-
content among the workers and then direct that discontent
against the Administration and its war effort. The worst of-
fenders in this respect have been the reactionary element

among the employers, ably seconded by John L. Lewis and

his admirers, within the labor movement.

. On the whole, labor, and especially the C.I.O. under Philip
Murray"s leadership, has a magniﬁcent record of support of
the war, of al1~out production, of patience in the face of prov-
ocations, and of ﬁrm adherence to the no-strike policy. Labor”!
has borne the burdens and sacriﬁces of war without com-

. plaining, has been patient when brazen proﬁteers were screamf?

ing insults in its ears, has understood its responsibilities as the
backbone of the nation.

But labor has also understood that it is not patriotic to
permit a steady deterioration of the supply of food, clothing
and shelter available to the soldiers of production, when this
is not the result of scarcity but only of ‘bad management and
bad faith. The soldiers‘ of production are entitled to, and

33

i need, as careful provision for their wants as the soldiers in
. the camps and on the battleﬁeld. The only legitimate -reason

for reducing their standards of life, when they are Working

* twice as hard as normal, would be an actual physical scarcity

of commodities which is not the case.

Any sensible wage policy must be designed toip-romote
maximum production. Therefore it must keep wages in re-
lation to prices, it must constantly correct inequalities, it
must strive toward equal wages for equal work, and it must
expand earnings in some established relation to expanded
production. Each group of workers and individual must feel
that he is not the helpless victim of arbitrary caprice, but
that governmental policy is constantly at work to approximate
a commonly accepted standard of just compensation—which
is his share of the available commodities in the light of his

* contribution to the national effort.

The absence of such a common-sense wage, policy is no
justiﬁcation for strikes. Every strike today is harmful to the
war,_harmful to the nation, harmful to the labor movement,
and harmful to the individual worker. We have made it clear

to the world that we are op-posed to all strikes as a matter of

policy. t .

But we must also insist that the Congress must stop pro-
moting and encouraging strikes, and employers must stop in-
citing strikes, The railroad workers, for example, were faced
with a law which provided that they must take a strike vote
and ﬁx a strike date in order to obtain due consideration of
their demands. Those responsible for not suspending that law
are much more guilty of the trouble on the railroads than are

’ the railroad unions and their leaders. The Smith-Connally

bill, which was supposedly intended to discourage. strikes, has
worked——and was intended to work—as a provocation to strikes,

a fact the President pointed out before it was passed over his

VCt'0.

The President’s original plans for regulating the wage
question were given the knockout blow by Congressional
sabotage. But he cannot leave it at that, with labor to suffer
the consequences. Because, with the best will in the world,

labor" cannot rest quiet under all this bungling and provoca-

34

 

fx
§ .
&

 

 

 

tion, any more than a machine“ can operate with maladjusted
parts and inadequate oil without deteriorating.

Labor has learned to expect no help in such questions from_

the present Congress. But labor does expect enlightened em-
ployers to take a new and more intense interest in helping
solve the vexing problem of wage policy. And above all, labor
expects the President to give the lead for a new over-all ex-
amination of the, problem and meanwhile. give emergency ad-
justment to some of the worst wage anomalies.

Labor in turn must begin to understand that it cannot‘

constantly demand help from the President, without acting
to strengthen the President’s hand in dealing with his enemies.
That is, labor must go into politics in a big way, in close
alliance with all progressive forces in the country, including

not only the farmers and middle class elements, but'lalso em- .

ployers and capitalists.
All of labor’s present or anized efforts lookin toward ef-
I I O P I g g
fective olitical action must be dee ened, stren thened and
P , . _ P 8
made broader and more inclusive. There must be a network

of unity built up among all labor’s various political com-L

mittees, from the locality, to the state, to the nation. All this
must culminate in ‘a great united effort in the 1944 elections,

L to guarantee the continuance of Roosevelt’s policies, and to

change the political complexion of Congress to make it a

help instead of a hindrance in winning the war and establish- '
» ing a stable peace.

‘ ABOLISH JIM CROW, THE POLL TAX, ANTI-SEMITISM
AND THE ANTI-COMMUNIST LAWS

, Vicious attacks have been leveled against the Communists
recently,. by supposedly responsible newspapers, with. the ac-
cusation that we ‘are stirring up civil strife in the country
by our support for Negro rights, our attack on the poll-tax,
our exposure of anti-Semitic--and other outrages by the racial-
ists, and our demand for the abolition of discriminatory laws
against the Communists. The demand is made upon us that we
shall abandon these issues at least until the war is won.

35

 

 
 
 

We cannot yield a fraction of an inch to such attacks and

such arguments. We may compromise, and do, on a hundred

other questions including the basic one of postponing all

- radical proposals for changing the social and economic sys-

tems-‘but once we abandoned the basic grounds of simple
democracy, then indeed all would be lost.

One cannot reconcile himself even temporarily to the Jim
Crow system, to the poll-tax, to anti-Semitism, and the prin-
ciple of exceptionalism directed against the Communists, with-
out thereby surrendering the basic strongholds of democracy
to the fascist enemy within and without. We cannot win this
war without conducting an irreconcilable struggle to purify
our democracy from all these fascist concepts.

This is only incidentally a struggle for the rights of the
minorities directly involved. These systematic violations of
the rights of minorities serve to poison and distort the politi-
cal, social and economic life of the entire nation. The ﬁght
to abolish these abuses is the business of all decent persons,
and is not a series of special interests—it is a supreme national
interest.

What we are ﬁghting for on these issues is nothing more
than the application in life of the long-disregarded Amend-
ments to the Constitution that came out of the Civil War.

On these issues we are in principle intransigeant, uncom-
promising, irreconcilable.

That does not mean that we are rash and reckless in the
choice of means in the ﬁght. On the contrary, we have never
ceased to oppose ‘all tendencies to lead the struggle into
divisive and damaging forms—witness our constant opposition
to the reckless and divisive tactics of the so-called “March—
on-Washington" movement led by A. Philip Randolph. We
have consistently advised only the most orderly, uniﬁed, calm
and well-considered form of political struggle well-‘established

‘in American democratic procedure. And these measures are

proving increasingly elfective. Racial discrimination can be
abolished now. .

We shall remain ﬁrm on this line, and continue to press it
as the only possible course for the whole democratic-progres
siveﬂcamp in the 1944 elections.

That ballot can only ‘be provided in~reality through a

It would be far less damaging to our democracy to postpone

to exclude ten millions, the creamtof our manhood, from any,

V. PROBLEMS OF THE ORGANIZATION
OF COMMUNISTS

AST May, when the dissolution of the Communist Inter-
national was announced, the New York Times and other
papers voiced the demand that the Communist Party of the
United States should also dissolve itself and disperse. At that
time I wrote a series of letters to the press in which I chal-
lenged the validity of this proposal, but expressed the readi-
ness of the Communist Party to discuss this or any other ques-
tion with any responsible spokesmen of public life, from the
single standard of how best to win the war. My letters were
reported to and approved by the June plenary session of our
National Committee.

We received no response from anyone to discuss this or any
other proposals for changes in the form of activities of the
Communist movement in this country.

At this meeting of our National Committee we are faced
only with the question, therefore, whether there are any
changes which we ourselves, unilaterally and without discus-
sion with anyone else, may ﬁnd it expedient to adopt in the
interest.of the nation, of the war, and of the working class
which we basically represent.

WHAT IS PERMANENT IN COMMUNIST ORGANIZATION? \

Recently we have published a pamphlet entitled A Talk
About the Communist Party,‘a report of speeches made by
myself in Detroit and Chicago to party membership meetings.
The function and role therein described for the organization
of Communists, of Marxists, are permanent features pf any
such organization, whatever may be its name or immediate
practical tasks. a I

Such an organization we are sure must be maintained in
the United States, and must be built even stronger. We know
that for the United States to be without such an organization
would weaken our country internally and in, its foreign rela-
tions. Internally, the organized Marxists furnish “one of the

most stable points of support and orientation for the whole
democratic-progressive camp; in foreign relations they furnish
the nation essential experience in the necessary policies for
dealing with Communists in other lands, such as China, Yugo-
slavia, Italy and France, where Communist cooperation is
absolutely inescapable if Europe and Asia are to be reor-
ganized in a period of relative peace and order. From this
point of view alone, the practical» conclusion must be drawn
that the continued and growing activity and organization of
the Communist movement in the United States are in the in-
terest of the nation, of the war and of an orderly. world after
the war. This is aconclusion which we believe inescapable
not only for ourselves but for all intelligent democrats.
There is not the same compelling fundamental reason why

"the organization should bear the name “Communist.” It is

conceivable that a situation might exist in which another
name would be practically more expedient, and in. several
countries that has been found to be the case by the Marxists
of such lands. But it is our considered judgment that there
is nothing in the situation of the United States which makes
such a change from the name “Communist” to something
else an expedient one. It might even be detrimental, in giving
an opening to our enemies to create more confusion in the

country by spreading suspicions that the new name is camou-I

ﬂage to cover direly sinister conspiracies. At the same time,

» the very name itself has the highest prestige of its history, and"

is not to be discarded lightly and without the most serious
necessity.

WHAT IS THE TYPICAL AMERICAN CONCEPT OF PARTY?

It is around the concept “Party” rather than of “Commu-
nist” that there exists today in America the most practical
obstruction to ourcooperative relationships with other demo-
cratic groups.

What is called the “two party system” in the United States
is an old tradition which dominates most American minds.
It recognizes as a “party” only that particular combination
of the opposition which is an immediate alternative to take
power. All lesser political groupings are contained within

the “two major parties,” which in fact are coalitions of many
- groups which in most countries would be separate p-arties;
or if the lesser group takes the name of “party,” and becomes
i one of the so-called “minor parties,” it is regarded as a sect
which h-as withdrawn itself from the practical political life
of the nation.

This “two party system?’ has been tremendously strengthened

that go on within it, by the system of direct primaries which
of the two major parties and participate in choosingiits candi-

ventions.

New York is one of the very few states in which the election
laws permit coalition of two or more parties on one list of
candidates; and only because of this fact has the American
Labor Party been able to grow into a signiﬁcant factor in
practical politics. In most other states a similar organization
could not function in the same way at all.

The_American working class shares very largely the general
national opinion that this “two party system” provides ade-
quate channels for the basic preservation of democratic rights.
How else are we to understand the fact that in 1940, not one
single organization, labor or otherwise, raised a protest against
the high-handed driving of the Communist Party of the ballot
by terror, intimidation and prison sentences?

It is not only the Communists, however, that bruise their

1912 and in 1924, two major attempts to break the old pattern,
made by Theodore Roosevelt and Robert M. LaFollette, Sr.,
made no lasting changes in the system, important as those
movements were in their general political. aspect.

A CHANGE FROM “PARTY” TO “AssocIATIoN”

' ordinated to the supreme ‘aim of realizing the promise of
"Teheran, of maintaining an orderly world which will give
us some generations of peace. ' i

and buttressed against the storms of constant political changes _
gives all voters the opportunity to enroll under one or ‘other’ I

dates, as well as the party committees and delegates to con-

heads against the stone wall of the “twoparty system.” In H ‘

.Now our country is entering a new period, in which, with .

Obviously, to realize the promise of Teheran the broadest
democratic-progressive united front must be maintained in
the United States: Equally obviously, the Communists will be
a part, and a small minority part, of that united front. The
Communist organization will be-in a long-term alliance with
forces much larger than itself. I

It follows from -this fa-ct, that in the peculiar American
sense of the word, the Communists will not be operating as
_a “party,” that is with their own separate candidates in elec-
tions, except under special circumstances when they may be
forced to act through “independent candidates.” -

This is already our practical situation; and we are now ex-
tending the perspective of national unity for many years into
the future. It is no longer an “emergency situation” but is
merging into a “normal” situgxtion. .

All these considerations point to the expediency of a deci-
sion that the Communist organization in the United States
should adjust its name to correspond more exactly to the
American political tradition and its own practical political

, role. »

Such a decision would be that, instead of being known as
“The Communist Party of the United States,” our organization
should call itself something like “American Communist Polit-
ical Association.” . .

It is the recommendation of our Political Committee that
this meeting of the -National Committee should endorse such
a proposal, referring it to our 1944 National Convention for
ﬁnal action.

Under such a name we will ﬁnd it much easier to explain
our ‘true relationship with all other democratic and progres-
sive groupings which operate through the medium, in the
main, of the two party system, and take our place in free

. collaboration at their side.

PREPARATIONS FOR OUR CONVENTION

In view of the far-reaching nature of the decisions to be
taken, the date of our convention should be advanced from
its usual timing in national election years, and take place
about the middle of May. /

\

41

 

  

    

The National Committee meeting should name a Na-tional
Election Campaign Committee, which should have full charge
of all election policy questions until the Convention.

\ A Committee on Constitution should be named, and charged
with the responsibility of examining all changes required in
the Constitution to fully implement the policy here laid down
if and when it shall be adopted by the convention, and be
prepared to report on such changes to the convention when
called upon.

I have purposely stripped this report down to the most es-
sential questions on which something new has to be said. It is

 

my opinion this will contribute to the clarity of the discussion, .

but it is not intended as a limitation upon any member of
the National Committee who has additional questions which
he thinks should be placed for discussion and decision in
connection with the main problems.

THREE ANNIVERSARIES

This year marks three important anniversaries.

It will be twenty-ﬁve years since the founding of the modern
Communist organizations out of which our party grew. This
will be an appropriate occasion for a historical survey to better
arm our party with an understanding of its origin and role.

It will be twenty years this month since the ﬁrst issue of the
Daily Worker came off the press. If this paper was always
indispensable, we must now begin to understand its tenfold
importance in the new period we are now entering. Its circu-
lation must begin to grow seriously.

It is twenty years since Lenin died. Today the vast majority
of Americans know that the state which Lenin founded and
Stalin brought to maturity is that single indispensable force
which saved us and the world from Nazi enslavement. We
who always treasured the legacy of Lenin for our country
have now more than ever the opportunity and. the duty to
make his full wisdom, which made the Soviet Union strong
and great, available to all Americans.

MARXISM ARMS COMMUNISTS TO MEET AND
SOLVE ISSUES TODAY”“

OR the ﬁrst time we are meeting and solving problems for

which there are no precedents in history and no formulas
from the classics which give us the answer. Perhaps we could
say that our party is fully standing on its own feet for the
ﬁrst time. We are seeking the answers to this new period in
what, I think, we are all convinced is the right direction; and
weare conﬁdent that we are really getting our ﬁngers into
these problems and beginning to control them. It seems _to
me that at this Plenum we have demonstrated the highest
stage of maturity that our party has ever reached.

I was especially pleased with Bob Minor’s contribution to
thediscussion because it was a living example of how to make
use of the classics of Marxism for the new period, without
falling into formulas and the searching for formulas.

| I think we must emphasize more th-an ever the tremendous
value of the classics of \Marxism in arming ourselves to meet
and solve the new and unprecedented problems. Marxism
never was a series of dogmas and formulas; it never was a

p catalogue of prohibitions listing the things we must not ..do

irrespective of new developments and new situations; it does
not tell us that things cannot be -done; it tells us how to do
the things that have to be done, the things that history has
posed as necessary and indispensable tasks. Marxism is a
theory of deeds, not of don’ts. Marxism is therefore a positive,
dynamic, creative force, and it is such a great social power
precisely because, as a scientiﬁc outlook and method, it takes
living realities as its starting point. It has always regarded the

scientiﬁc knowledge of -the past as a basis for meeting the
new . and unprecedented problems of the present and the

future; And the largest problems today are new in a very basic
sense. . ~ .
Wehave more than ever the task to refresh ourselves in the
great tradition of Marxism, completely freeing ourselves from
the last remnants of the dogmatic and schematic approach.
Marxism is the science of the transition to socialism.

It was Marx and Engels who transformed socialism from a
utopia into a science, from an inspiring dream—grounded only
in the desire for a better life—into a mighty movement powered
by the material and objective necessities of social development.
That transformation from utopianism has a lesson we have
to relearn today in the lightof the new world‘ situation.
Basically, that lesson is that socialism arises out of the de-
velopment of existing society which creates certain necessities
that ultimately press the great masses of people to take the
path of ‘socialism. These necessities exist independently of

‘ our thinking, but when we understand how the process works

we can greatly facilitate and speed it up. In fact, our under-
standing and our thinking become a great and decisive factor
in turning what history has made objectively possible into
actual reality, but our thinking is never an independent fac-
tor; and by thinking alone we cannot change the course of
history. We can guide the course of history only if we under-
stand the basic forces of history that exist outside of our‘ own
minds.

. We have to be humble and learn from history) we have to

’ learn from facts and never try to impose our preconceptions

upon“ history. That is one. of the ﬁrst lessons of Marxism,
which we have to relearn afresh if we are to make the fullest

possible use of this tremendous intellectual arsenal that has i

been given. to us by the great thinkers and leaders of the
Socialist-Communist movement. We cannot rise tothe heights
that are necessary to master this historical moment through
intellectual arrogance. We must be prepared to refresh our-
selves according to the necessities of the period into which
history has brought us, and, above all, we must understand
that history never yet has been known to follow anyone’s

private blueprint. The great turning points,of history are in

this ‘SCHSC always unexpected; there is always something new,

44 '

 

,. ‘/<-j‘~¢r1(-34;”;-4,.‘ ,-.f,_....._..,,_,. .. 

 

,,.. ,.—.-V i__. .-

something freshin them that has to be_ fundamentally evalu-
ated. We are in such a period today.

This requires from everyone who aspires to leading func-
tions a deep feeling of responsibility, personal responsibility
for the successful conduct of the smallest tasks of daily work,
such as the successful conclusion of our recruiting drive, for
example, but above all, it requires intellectual responsibility,
the responsibility for each one of us individually to think
through and master these problems.

Fortunately even these new things in history do not present
themselves unannounced; almost always they knock on the
door before they come in. That is why we were not entirely
unprepared in this Plenum for the decisions that we are mak-
ing, unprecedented as these decisions are. True, according to

s all of the text books of the past, we are departing from ortho-

doxy, because none of our text books foresaw or predicted a
long period of peaceful relations in the world before the gen-

eral advent of socialism. But now we are setting our course

to realize the possibilities inherent in the present situation of

‘what would have been described in the past as an evolutionary

development of the transition period—provided, of course,
that we can successfully meet our responsibilities.

This is possible because the price in blood and struggle has
been paid in advance in this terriﬁc war, and because we
already have a ﬁrm bastion and fortress of socialism established

2 in the Soviet Union during twenty-six years of the most heroic

and intelligent construction which the history of humanity
has ever recorded.

We are not prepared to give any broad theoretical generali- .

zations for this period. But we know, as we go intoit boldly,
without the slightest hesitation that we are ﬁrmly guided by
the theoretical heritage of Marxism and that the Teheran

Declaration which was signed by Churchill, Roosevelt and the
great Marxist Stalin represents the only program in the in-_
.- terest of the toiling masses of the whole world in the next .
' period. We could not do more than give general intimations of

the possibilities of such a period. We could not unconditionally
throw our forces into this new period while it was still merely
a possibility, but now that this possibility has been conﬁrmed

by the agreement of Teheran, we know we can feel absolutely
certain that we have crossed the border-line from the past
and have deﬁnitely entered the present.

When we speak of the Teheran agreement we must under-
stand that it was an agreement among the ruling classes of

' complete monopoly of military power in the world and an
overwhelming preponderance of economic power. The power
behind that combination comes from its permanence, because
if it would not be permanent it would not be powerful. The
power of that combination can only be fully realized when
we begin to study what are the alternatives to it. Many vesti-
mable gentlemen today are lightheartedly taking potshots at
the Teheran agreement. But I venture to predict that they will
be changing their tune, because they will begin to face the al-
ternative to Teheran; and if they don’t face it, history will
begin to rub their noses into the problem and make them
face it. -

Imagine the problems facing the United States without
the Teheran agreement. American economy has been expanded
to a scale beyond the wildest dreams of any American capi-
talist. The American bourgeoisie today is in possession of the

powers that their imaginations cannot encompass it. Some
of them have had their minds turned as a result of this power
and the product is the fantasies of the “Luce-thinking” school.
But what are all the fantasies of this “Luce-thinking” school
worth unless they are brought down to earth and harnessed
to the Teheran agreement? They will all explode from their
own internal contradictions unless they are harnessed to serve
the cause of world progress, harnessed in the combination of
Teheran. And without Teheran the catastrophe that would
come upon us and the rest of the world would ‘be all the
more certain and complete. These hard facts are the material
guarantee behind the Teheran pact. ‘

Our conﬁdence in this Agreement is buttressed not only in

this pact into being, but ﬁrst of all in an understanding and
_knowledge that there is no other way for the world and that

46

three great powerful countries‘ who today hold an almost A

effective control and direction of such enormous productive ’

our high opinion of each of the three great men who brought

  

there is still intelligence enough left in America, despite our
newspapers, to guarantee that our country will not rush head-
long and blindly over the precipice of disaster that is the only
alternative to Teheran. With that conﬁdence, we can be com-
pletely sure of our course.

Our course isnot easy and it will require political struggles

but these must be struggles for unity in the nation, not strug-

gles which will break that unity; struggles against the enemies
for which we will have to ﬁnd ever new means and forms;
of unity and for uniting everyone who recognizes, even in-
distinctly, but enough to take the ﬁrst steps, the need of going
along the road of the Teheran Conference.

We are not in our new course entering any other party.
The Communists are not joining the Democratic Party; the
Communists are not joining the Republican Party. We are not
endorsing either of the major parties, and we are not con-
demning either of the major parties. We are taking the line
of issues and not of parties and of choosing men as they
stand for or against issues without regard to party labels.
This was one of the biggest arguments I developed in my
book Vict0ry—and After. When I say that we are not enter-
ing parties or not endorsing parties, I don’t mean we have
any objections to our individual members. registering in one or
the other of the parties when their local community life calls

- for it and their associates and fellows are following that course.

But I mean that the Communist movement and our organiza-
tion is not committed to any party label or any party organi-
zation. _

We are independent, in the same way'as the great bulk of
America’s independent voters who make up fully one-third
of the total voting strength of the country and who are not
committed to either of the major parties, though 'most of
them are registered with one or the other. As a part of this
independent voters’ group, we may ﬁnd our members regis-
tering wherever they think will best advance the progressive
cause. That is one of the rights of citizenship and our organi-
zation would not think of denying to any American the full
exercise of all his rights as an American citizen. But our or-
ganization is not and will not be an organization committed to

any party; and that is necessarily the case because of the na-
ture of the two major parties. These two parties are essentially
institutionalized-channels, semi-governmental in their nature,
through which the citizenry groups and regroups itself from
election to election according to the leadership that is thrown
up and the issues that are thereby developed.

In the general relationship of forces in the country, for us
there can be no commitment to party because that would be
to commit ourselves to an institutionalized structure which

 

stands for nothing in particular in the political sense. There- .

fore we have to concentrate our attention exclusively on issues,
and on men who represent issues within the various party
structures, and choose freely among them on their merits
without regard to party label. _ "
This is the major point that I thought necessary to bring
forward in these summary remarks, as a sort of continuation
of the discussion, because it seems to me that while there is
general acceptance of the course on which we are going, there
is perhaps not the same complete and general understanding
that this new course is not in any way an identiﬁcation with
any of the old party structures. If we are identifying ourselves
with. any general, big political grouping in the country, in the
narrower electoral sense, it is with the great body of independ-
ent voters of America who in the electoral struggle will choose
whom they support on the basis of their judgment of the
character of men and of the issues for which they stand, and

~ nothing else.

    

I have the general feeling that in these three days we have
welded together such a common body of opinion so ﬁrmly
grounded in our own experience, in the objective reality of
the world outside, and in our capacity to understand—a col-
lective capacity which is our great strength—that we can go
from this meeting of the National Committee with a greater
conﬁdence than ever before that we will meet and solve the
problems facing us with honor to our great movement, to our
organization and with a full meeting of our responsibilities to
the nation and to the working class.

evIc1'oRv—ANn AFTER 4
By EARLBROWDER 4

Earl Browder’s book, Victory——and A fter, of which close to
half a million copies have been sold in 1945, represents the
views of the foremost American Communist leader, and the
organization which he heads, on the most vital questions of
the war.

While written during an earlier stage of the war, this
' statesmanlike and far-visioned work, which clearly foresaw the
course of world historical development under the impact of y
the global conﬂict, ﬁnds daily conﬁrmation as the war pro- it
gtesses. The validity and correctness of the Communist posi-
tion have found supreme confirmation in the epoch-making
'I_‘eheran Agreement, a sound understanding of.wh-ich will be
immensely aided by the study of Victory—.—amd After.

In discussing the nature of the war, "the strategy required
for victory, the problems of international and national unity,
and the attitude to the war effort of the various political par-
ties in the United States, the author has applied in a living .
and dialectical manner the science of Marxism. Of particular
interest today are those chapters dealing with the problems of A
the colonial countries, and relations between the capitalist
democracies and the socialist Soviet Union for speeding the
victory and for the tasks of post-war construction.

I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TEHERAN

NY realistic dealing with national and world problems
A today must begin and end with an evaluation of the
Teheran meeting of Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt, and the
auxiliary conferences of Cairo and Moscow. The answer to
all other questions will depend, in the ﬁnal analysis, upon the
judgment made of Teheran and its consequences.

Before Teheran, the world faced two "central questions which
had not yet been answered: Was it possible for Great Britain,
the Soviet Union and the United States to bring their full
combined power to bear against the main enemy, Nazi Ger-

many, in full coalition warfare, and thus ensure the quickest ~

and least costly victory in the war? Would this coalition, after

the destruction of its common enemy, break up into its com-
ponent parts, each going its own way, and thus open up im-

mediately a new period of revolutionary upheavals and inter-
national wars that would inevitably culminate in World War
III? ‘

From Teheran the chief leaders of the three powers gave
clear and deﬁnite answers to both questions. Since their
declaration is of a conciseness that is characteristic of the
greatest documents of history, I will quote the entire text.
It says:

“We, the President of the United States of America, the

Prime Minister of Great Britain and the Premier of the Soviet *

Union, have met in these four days past in this the capital of
our ally, Teheran, and have shaped and conﬁrmed our com-
mon policy. '

“We express our determination that our nations shall work
together in the war and in the peace that will follow.

“As to the war, our military staffs have joined in our

roundtable discussions and we have concerted our plans for

5

    

the destruction of the German forces. We have reached com-

a plete agreement as to the scope and timing of operations which

will be undertaken from the east, west and south. The com-
mon understanding which we have here reached guarantees

’ that victory will be ours.
“And as to the peace, we are sure that our concord will ‘

make it an enduring peace. We recognize fully the supreme
responsibility resting upon us and all the nations to make a
peace which will command good will from the overwhelming
masses of the peoples of the world and banish the scourge
and terror of war for many generations.

“With our diplomatic advisers we have surveyed the prob-
lems of the future. We shall seek the cooperation and active
participation of all nations, large and small, whose peoples
in heart and mind are dedicated, as are our own people, to
the elimination of tyranny and slavery, oppression and in-
tolerance. We will welcome them as they may choose to
come into the world family of democratic nations.

“No power on earth can prevent our destroying the Ger-
man armies by land, their U-boats by sea; and their war
plants from the air. Our attacks will be relentless and in-
creasing.

“Emerging from these friendly conferences we look with
conﬁdence to the day when all the peoples of the world may
live free lives untouched by tyranny and according to their
varying desires and their own consciences.

“We ‘came here with hope and determination. We leave here
friends in fact, in spirit and in purpose.”

'That is all. It is enough to answer the main questions, and
to give in the most realistic form a new perspective to the
world. _

There is but one way to understand the Declaration of
Teheran. That is to take it at its face value. It means what it
says, and it does not mean something else. All commentators
who have attempted to decipher some mysterious and hid-
den meanings behind the open and frank words of this Declara-
tion have as a consequence proceeded from one confusion and
blunder to another. There are deep» implications in the Declar-
ation, but they can be unfolded only as we start uncondi-

‘ tionally from the-premise that the words mean what they‘ say.

THE GUARANTEE OF MILITARY VICTORY

Complete agreement as to the scope and timing of military
operations from east, west and south, reached between the
High Command of the three great Allies, has long been un-
derstood by all serious persons as the sole guarantee of victory.
The Nazis have long known this to be the sure doom of the
Third Reich. The only thing that was not certain was whether
that complete agreement could be reached. The Nazis based
all their hopes upon that complete agreement being blocked
by differences among their enemies, whipped up and played
upon by their friends within Britain and America. All anti-
fascists based their word and deed upon contributing every-
thing to bring that complete agreement into being. That was
accomplished in Teheran. -' /

In the nature of things the details of that agreement will be
known only as they unfold in action. For the world outside
the active military command, the only important thing is the
existence of the ‘agreement. Given this agreement, the rest of
us have no reservations to the motto, “Leave it to the ex-
perts,” which we opposed only when it was used to block
the agreement rather than to ﬁnd and execute it. ‘

The guarantee of victory is not, ‘however, the substance of

victory. The guarantee is operative only in battle, and for the

United States the serious ﬁghting on a large scale is only now
about to open up. Only now do the American people begin
to pay the price of victory in casualty lists of dead, wounded
and prisoners that will exceed our normal peace-time blood-
letting in highway accidents, the price of automobile trans-
port.

still doing serious harm to the morale of the people by the

Our irresponsible American newspapers have done and are

constant spread of illusions, in the most varied forms, that

victory will come without any heavy price in American lives.
That is the only reason. why the seditious speculations of a
Wheeler, a Nye, and a Taft-Hartmann—Norman Thomas
“Peace Now” movement, can offer a serious threat to our
country's supreme war effort now about to open. For the
American people are essentially sound and practical, as re-
