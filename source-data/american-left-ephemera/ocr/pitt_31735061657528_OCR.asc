which all progressive Americans can unite today.” The ﬁrst
one under the heading “push the ﬁght for 60,000,000 jobs-
meet the human needs of Reconversion,” calls _for a struggle
to “make the righ.t to work and the democratic aims of the
Second Bill of Rights the law of the land.”

But the resolution warns against the illusion that there is a
permanent solution in this immediate program.

“As class—conscious American workers, as Marxists, we Com-
munists will do all in our power to help the American work-
ing class and its allies to ﬁght for and realize this program,”
the resolution goes on. “At the same time we will systematical-
ly explain to the people that substantial gains for the masses
secured under capitalism are inevitably precarious, unstable
and only partial‘ and that socialism alone can ﬁnally and com-
pletely abolish the social evils of capitalist society, including
economic insecurity, unemployment and the danger of fas-
cism and war. ' . ‘ 4

“However, this program of action will help the work-
ing class and the people as ‘a whole to meet their urgent
immediate practical needs, enhancing generally their
strength and inﬂuence in the nation. In the struggle for
the program for peace and democracy, jobs and security,
favorable conditions are created for the masses of our
people to recognize, on the basis of their own experience,
the need for the eventual reorganization of society along
socialist lines."

Prosperity — Real or False?

There is only one alternative to the program for 60,000,000
jobs: it is the road back which monopoly interests and their
political tools advise us to take.

America’s big business interests were in the war against
fascism and Japanese imperialism. But. their objectives were
not the same as those of the people who fought, worked and
sacriﬁced to defeat the Axis. T

Our economic royalists have more in common with the
defeated foe than with the people of America: This is why
they maneuvered almost from the start of the war, for a

10

 

 

negotiated peace under which the main base of reaction in
Germany and Japan would have still been preserved. They
are still scheming for a new lease of life to their defeated

. blood brothers in the former Axis lands.

Our monopolists viewed the war as an opportunity to scoop-
in unprecedented proﬁts, squeeze out small business people
and gain new imperialist advantage. In those respects they
succeeded. War production was hardly in swing when several
dozen of America’s large corporations hogged the bulk of
the war orders. Smaller plants were at their mercy for sub-
contracts.

Not only have the large corporations seized the ground
ﬂoor on war contracts, they also negotiated prices based on
pre-war productivity. The great rise in labor eﬂiciency through
the four war years gave them unprecedented proﬁts, too.

In 1939, corporate proﬁts, after taxes, were $4.2 billion
dollars. Proﬁts in the following years, as estimated by the
Department of Commerce, reached $5.8 billion in 1940; $8.5
billion, 1941; $8.7 billion in 1942.; $9.8 billion in 1943, and

’ $9.9 billion in 1944. The 1945 proﬁt rate ran as high as 1944

judging by results for the ﬁrst half of the year. The number
of corporations with a billion or more assets grew from

_ thirty-two to forty-three."

This rise of proﬁts continued despite the increased taxes.
In 1944 corporate taxes reached $15 billion, but that did not
prevent"'the nearly $10 billion proﬁt. ‘

America’s big business enters peace far richer, far more
arrogant, and commanding a far greater productive capacity,
than ever. before.

We have had a preview of big business plans back in the
postwar twenties, when corporations ran affairs pretty much
as they liked and they ran roughshod over the welfare of the
majority of America’s people. Augmented by the crop of new
millionaires that came out of World War 1, they made the
most of a short “boom.” The basis for this golden era of fast
and easy proﬁts were some savings in the hands of the people,
representing mainly purchases deferred during the war years;
over-investment in new industries; imperialist expansion and
trade, especially in South America; speculative real estate

11

 

   

booms and sale of automobiles, refrigerators, washing ma-

ment plans.

To all outward appearances America's was a skyrocketing
prosperity. But there was no bottom to this prosperity. While
comparatively high wages were paid in‘ a few skilled categories,
more than half of the 33,000,000 wage earners before the 1929
crash, earned less than the $25 weekly average for the country.
Less than a tenth of the employed workers earned over $40
weekly. Many industries, among them lumber, tobacco, cotton
and knit goods, candy, canned goods and shirts, showed aver-
age earnings below $20 weekly. A fourth of the railway work-
ers earned less than $20. ’

Those substandard wages were paid at’ a time when the
Bureau of Labor Statistics “minimum health and decency
budget” ranged from $2,100 in the lowest city to $2,551 in
the most expensive. 1 , .

Those earnings were for an average of some ‘ﬁfty hours
weekly in all manufacturing (49.6 hours was the average in
1927). In steel it was around ﬁfty-four weekly and in union-
ized industries, including building, it was 44.8 hours during
the high water mark year of 1929. In some Southern indus-
tries straight time hours reached as high as sixty 21 week.

The 1922-29 “prosperity,” therefore, was only, an illusion.
It wasn’t even sustained by unemployment insurance, social
security or some legal regulation of working hours and mini-
mum wages. Much of the industrial expansion of that period
was based on the expectancy that the “boom” would go on
indeﬁnitely. Capitalism seemed so powerful that a great deal
of popular conﬁdence developed in its abilityto exist without
any intervention of government authority.

The labor movement, too, to a great extent, became cor-
rupted by this illusion. A postwar open shop and wage cutting
drive had already whittled labor’s strength down to about half
of the 5,000,000 membership that it reached by 1920. Com-
pany unions swept the country so rapidly that they reached a
membership about equal to that of the regular organizations.
The_A. F. of L.’s top leadership bowed to the golden calf with
a policy of class collaboration. This took the form of capitula-

12

 

chines and radios stimulated in large measure through install-

tion to the will of employers through schemes that bound
unions hand and foot and banned strikes. Instead of a struggle
for higher wages, labor banking and stock ownership by work-
ers became the remedy. But the 1929 crash that markedthe

‘ end of “prosperity” also smashed illusions in this type of

labor-management “partnership”, and servile labor leadership.
/ Thus ended the wild seven-year orgy of the Harding-
Coolidge-Hoover era. Its fruits were the ten years that fol-
lowed. At one point unemployment reached the ﬁgure of
17,000,000. America never knew such poverty. Hoovervilles,
hunger, souplines, evictions, family breakups, bankruptcies,
sheriff sales, unprecedented exploitation of those who still
worked, stalked the land. Those days are remembered by
Americans like a nightmare. The memory of them continues
to torture the minds of workers today as they see millions al-
ready unemployed. '

But for big business the few roaring years of the twenties
are a sweet memory. They continue to vigorously oppose any
economic planning, or any government intervention in econ-
omy. Their “free enterprise” slogan‘ holds that the secret of
prosperity will be found only in a capitalism that runs its free
and wild course, without restraint or guidance. They view
economy as a gambling table with the eyes of gamblers who
lay big stakes and force quick decisions. The health of econ-
omy, and the welfare of. the multitudes of men, women and
children whose very lives depend upon it, does not interest
them. They crave for another free-for-all in which the strong-
est become mightier and the weak sink into poverty. A de-
pression to them is only the aftermath of the game of pros-
perity in which “losers” are as inevitable as winners.

S_ix+y Million Jobs or I5 Million Jobless?

The policy of the National Association of Manufacturers
and its political tools in Congress would lead us to another
false Harding-Coolidge-Hoover “prosperity” and the inevit-
able depression that would follow. All the hue and. cry about
the government threatening “free enterprise” is part of the
campaign to wipe out all public restraint upon the proﬁteers.

13

 

   
 

The very big business interests who today shout loudest
about the sacredness of “free enterprise” had to be dragged
into the war effort. Some of our largest industries were on a

sitdown strike against the Government until guaranteed as

high rate of proﬁt and assured tax refunds for postwar gifts.
Today, as we work to set our postwar economy on a sound
footing, they again come forward in the same destructive role.

They demand that wages be brought down to pre-war levels.
This would “stimulate” sales, they say. They oppose higher
unemployment beneﬁt rates because they want a huge hungry
army of job seekers who could be used to depress wages and
weaken unions.

Preparations for an open-shop drive, patterned after the
campaign that followed World War I, were evident from the
very day. that Pearl Harbor was struck. The central theme of
big business propagandists was anti-union incitement among
soldiers, farmers, and the public at large. Every strike was
drummed up out of all proportion. Provocations to break the
no-strike pledge were numerous and quite transparent. The
real object was to discredit labor and prepare the atmosphere
for a postwar open shop drive. And this, in face of a no-
strike record that surpassed all hopes.

While building an anti-labor hysteria, big business has been
screaming for laws to hamstring labor. Such laws were already
passed in a number of state legislatures. But the main overall
federal bill incorporating practically everything reaction could
desire against labor, is the Ball-Burton-Hatch Bill introduced
in the Senate. This union-busting proposal is put forward
as an “industrial peace” code for reconversion.

Another basic objective of reaction is revision of the tax
law to shift the main burden of war debts and the much heavier
postwar budget upon the lower-incomed people. i

From all this it should be clear that for the monopoly inter-
ests reconversion is literally no more than return to pre-war
conditions and levels. But what would a return to 1940 “nor-
malcy” mean?

In 1940 we had 46,000,000 employed, some of them irregu-
larly or on short weeks, while some 8,000,000 were unem-
ployed. In that year our national products and services totaled

14

 

 

$97 billions, which was already above the output of the top
“prosperity” year of 1929. .
When hostilities ended, War Mobilization and Reconversion
Director John W. Snyder revealed that some 7,ooo,ooo were
added to the nation’s labor force during the -‘war along with
the absorption of almost all those who were jobless in 1940
and induction of some 11,ooo,ooo into the armed services.
With all due allowance for those who may retire from work,
President Roosevelt estimated that we will need 6o,ooo,ooo jobs
or 14,ooo,ooo more than in 1940 to keep every body willing to
work employed and off relief. This should also take into ac-
count the aged, youth and housewives who leave the labor
market because those are more than balanced by the unprece-
dented increase in labor efficiency and technical progress dur-
ing the war years. Department of Commerce estimates show
that on the basis of present productive eﬂiciency, 1946 with
only 55 million jobs, or a 20 per cent manpower increase over
1940, would yield products and services amounting to $140
billion (at 1940 prices) or 45 per cent over 194o’s products.
The Committee for Economic Development, the principal
capitalist postwar planning organization, admitted that going
back to 1940 is going back not to eight million but to 15,-

ooo,ooo unemployed. Other estimates place the ﬁgure higher.

Mr. Snyder, in hisreport to the President immediately after
Japan surrendered, set forth four major objectives, point 1 of
which called for “Jobs for all able and willing to work.” That
means 60 million jobs and a national product much closer to-
the nearly $175 billion reached in 1944 than the $97 billion
of 1940. Uncle Sam was customer for nearly half of 1944’s
product. The problem now, therefore, is to ﬁnd another
customer for an equivalent of our war output. ,

Snyder recognizes this and ‘follows with Point 2, which says
that we must have “a steady rising standard of living." We
will have to live “5o per cent better” he declared. This is well
put, but, unfortunately, the initiative up until this writing has
been more in the hands of those ,who take their inspiration
from the N.A.M. ’

The government, far from preparing to meet such a situa-
tion, stubbornly held on to the “Little Steel” formula which

15

 

   
 

froze wages to a level only 15 per cent over the standards of
January, 1941. Nor did the government show extraordinary
pressure for a timely increase in unemplpyment insurance
rates or the wage minimum. ~ '

Big business is preparing to sell the virtues of “free enter-
prise” anew on the crest of the much heralded, “boom” of
post-World War II. As in the twenties, a race is under way
for the savings of the people and such foreign markets as may
be available while Europe is occupied with reconstruction. Un-
doubtedly, such a short “boom” will follow. But if nothing
is done to prop the purchasing power of Americans the boom
will burst like a bubble in less than seven years.

The hero groomed for the coming days is the salesman. Said
Walter D. Fuller, President of Curtis Publishing and a spokes-
man of the N.A.M., at a postwar planning conference:

“Only selling can lick another depression and put us
on the road to prosperity and progress. Business must as-
sume the job of preparing to sell, sell, sell, as it never sold
before.”

A postwar planning numberof the Joumal of Commerce
summarizing various views, quotes one large advertising ﬁrm
as holding that “advertising, aiding good salesmanship, will
be the panacea to avoid postwar unemployment. Only con-
sumers make jobs possible.” _

The notorious labor-hater Sewell Avery, head of Mont-
gomery Ward,-is quoted in the same newspaper as saying:

“It is not the chief responsibility of business after the
war to provide jobs for everyone. A corporation’s eﬂi-
ciency is indicated by the'number of men it can release
from a job, not the number of men hired.”

There is no doubt that “efﬁ.ciency,” as seen by Avery, has
reached a new high in America. Salesmanship, too, will rise
to a new high in coming months. But we well remember the
days when the best of salesmen couldn't sell much.

A Sfronger Labor Movemenf Challenges Monopolisfs

Organized labor emerged out of this war a great and power- ‘
ful force, recognized as the backbone of progress.
A 16

This is a contrast to the situation after World War I when
a weak labor movement, hamstrung by reactionary leaders,
narrow in outlook, and averse to political action, became an
easy prey to an open shop drive. The unions of 1919, with
less than ﬁve million members, hardly had any inﬂuence on
the country’s reconversion plans. Other sections of the popu-
lation showed no conﬁdence in organized labor. The labor
movement gave little leadership in those days. Initiative was
almost entirely with the multi-millionaires who came out of
the war richer and more imperialistic-minded than ever.

Little wonder that within three or four years after the Armis-
tice was signed A. F. of L. membership was downeto less than
three million and conditions in the shops were a mockery of
unionism. _ ~

When V-J Day came, membership of regular unions passed
14 millions. The decisive and heavy industries are unionized.
Union strength is buttressed by many laws which protect the
right of collective bargaining, wage minimums and working

hours. Contracts are a great improvement over the agreements

of 25 years ago.

With the rise of labor’s strength came a steady rise of its
prestige. Its inﬂuence became reﬂected in the Federal’ admin-
istration and in many state‘ and city governments. Middle
class groups, including white collar and professional people,

small business groups, the Negropeople in general and farm .

groups, have shownincreasing interest in common action with
labor. '

’But there is also a great qualitative change in labor’s ranks
as compared to 1919. Leadership, even in the A. F. of L., is not
entirely in the hands of the very conservative top ofﬁcialdom.
The C.I.O. is far more progressive and aggressive. It is the
C.I.O. that has held the initiative on the big issues through
which labor scored its biggest inﬂuence among the workers and
people as a whole. We have seen it in the drives to organize
the unorganized, in the struggle for Negro rights, in the war
effort and in the 1944 political campaign. '

Above all, however, labor’s greatest asset today is its war
record. Reactionaries hoped to come out of this war with
labor in the doghouse, blamed for strikes and war production

17

  

lags. They expected that by V-] Day the stage would be fully
set for veteran-labor antagonism and. anti-union laws. But
this hope proved disappointing. Labor has kept its no-strike
pledge and did so in face of every conceivable form of provo-
cation from employers and disruptive defeatist groups. With
the notable exception of John L. Lewis and a few minor labor
oﬂicials known for their coldness to the war effort, the A‘. F. of
L. and C.I.O. made good upon the pledge. Labor’s achieve-
ment on the war production line is one of this war’s glorious
chapters. The trade unions were the mainspring of the tre-
mendous crusade that brought the undreamed of output of
planes, tanks, ships and guns.

The people of America, particularly the soldiers, among
whom organized labor had at least 3,000,000 members, are well
aware of labor’s part in the war. Reaction will not be able
to turn popular sentiment against labor—that is, if labor
seizes its opportunity to give progressive leadership. The
much—strengthened organized labor movement today will not
be a silent “partner.”

Long before the Second Front was opened labor called for
a deﬁnite and planned postwar perspective. Many a union
convention or conference resolution went to government
authorities warning that peace will ﬁnd us unprepared. Labor

spokesmen, and progressives generally, have often predicted the

very picture that we see unfolding in America today—layoif
of millions, with the administration itself predicting eight
million jobless by Spring, 1946; no protection of wage stand-
ards—no ‘improvement of jobless insurance and no ready pub-
lic works program. Only bales of contract cancellation tele-
grams were ready. .

The majority of Congress, both in 1944 and 1945, turned a
deaf ear to the warnings. The ﬁght over the 1944 Kilgore
Bill, which did offer the needed program, is an example. The
bill would have made the government responsible for provision
of work where private industry failed; for transportation
expenses back home for dislocated workers and it would have
increased unemployment beneﬁts to $2 5 weekly. The Kilgore
bill was defeated even after it‘ was stripped to only its unem-
ployment beneﬁt provision. Southern poll-taxers and reac-

18

 

 

\

tionary Republicans united to kill it. Stating their position,
Senator Charles Taft of Ohio said:

“I don’t think we can employ all the people and cer-
tainly not at present wages. If so, if we go on as we are
doing, we will wreck the United States. The tax burden
will be so heavy you’ll destroy private enterprise. Then
we’ll have state socialism.”

Taft’s policy guided Congress. The only reconversion legis-
lation that was passed covered procedure for contract can-
cellation, removal of government property from plants and
disposal of surplus war goods. -The only contribution to re-
conversion by the 1945 Congress up until the summer adjourn-
ment, was a change in the tax bill affecting the provision
which guarantees to corporations their 1937-39 average proﬁt
for the ﬁrst two postwar years. The change enables them_to
draw in advance‘ the anticipated deﬁciency from the U. S.
Treasury. No such interestwas shown in the laid—off workers.

Uncle Sam's Planfs

But, perhaps one of the most important issues that must
be fought out is the problem of the $15,5oo,ooo,ooo worth of
government owned plants. There is no government outside
of the Soviet Union that owns so much plant capacity. Even
if Britain carries through its immediate nationalization pro-
gram, the government-controlled capacity will not be anywhere
near Uncle Sam's. /

The government paid for nearly all the country's synthetic
rubber plants and high octane gas capacity; 92 per cent of
the magnesium capacity; 90 per cent of aircraft and about
half of our aluminum and machine tool capacity. There are

. some 2,500 plants in all, and they are our newest and most

eﬂicient. James F. Byrnes, former War Mobilization Director,
estimated in his report to the President in January, 1945, that
plants with a value of $1o,ooo,ooo,ooo are immediately or po-
tentially usable for peacetime purposes. '

Part of the same problem is the fate of our sixty million
tons of shipping capacity, 85 per cent of which is government
owned. The ﬂeet today is about ﬁve times as large as the U. S.

merchant ﬂeet was before the war. The National Maritime
Union has raised the problem long before the war ended, well
remembering how after the last war ships were scrapped or
laid up while the men who built and sailed them, were left
jobless and hungry.

Monopoly interests in a number of ﬁelds, particularly steel,

_aluminum, rubber, shipbuilding and automotive. industries,

are looking with concern upon this government-owned ca-
pacity. They would like to have it all scrapped for fear that
competitive groups may get hold of much of it. As a second
choice they would like to buy those plants over a bargain
counter just as government property was sold for a fraction
of its value after the last war. Some companies are thinking
of scrapping their old plants and replacing them with the
new ones. Then, of course, we have the old law ofmonopoly
ca.pitalism—of buying out uncontrolled plants just to shut them
down and keep them out of competitive hands.

The closing of the Willow Run bomber plant months be-
fore the war ended gave an indication of what business inter-
ests have in mind. ’ The hundred million dollar plant, op-
erated by the Ford Motor Co., was declared by company heads
as “expendable as a battleship—-and not more expensive, at

. that.” This most modern of America’s plants was simply pu_t

in the class of a war instrument‘ that should be regarded as
having performed its usefulness.

A New York Timesreview of the problem of the “many
Willow Runs, large and small” also concludes that “they are
expendable”, (August 26, 1945.)

The problem raises a number of questions. Are the nu-

merous communities built up around the new plants to become V

ghost towns? Is this vast property paid for out of the public
treasury to be sacriﬁced to the Moloch of monopoly proﬁt
rates? How serious are we about our perspective of expanded
economy if these most modern plants are to be scrapped?
What is to happen to the .millions we added to our man-
power pool if the new plant capacity is to be kept idle?
President R. J. Thomas of the United Automobile Workers,
testifying before the Senate War Contracts Committee, gave
labor’s answer as far back as April 26, 1944., when he said:

20

 

\

“We are unalterably opposed to plowing under or scrapping,
whether it takes place openly or covertly.”

The problem of ﬁnding use for those plants is also the prob-
lem of ﬁlling America's long deferred’ needs. If we really
intend to expand housing construction and air traﬂic, and
mechanize our farms, then we can use these plants. The new
plants, far from being a source of unemployment, could be-
come a driving power for greater employment.

Furthermore, we face the problem of small business. Are
we to take it for granted that these very expensive properties
are within reach of only big business bidders? The Smaller
War Plants Corporation is already pushing a plan for multiple
tenancy in the government plants. Floor space wou1d(be divided
up to suit various private small undertakings. Building facili-
ties and management could be placed under specially formed!
corporations, much as such plans operate at large city-markets,
terminals, garment centers and other manufacturing buildings.

Labor, and with it all anti-monopolist America, are dead set
against any scrapping or a bargain-counter plan for Uncle
Sam’s plants and ships. The yardstick determining the sale or
rental of every one of them must be the extent to which an
employment guarantee is given. C.I.O. President Philip Mur-
ray stated the issue clearly when he said that if private indus-
try won't operate them then government must.

Shaping a Reconversion Program

Labor, although divided, has been generally united in atti-
tude on postwar issues. This unity of purpose has been forged
in the process of struggle against big business policies. To the
extent that labor showed leadership, it also won the support
of- circles of farm, middle class and small business groups.
Unfortunately, however, labor was only beginning to make
its reconversion demands known when V-] Day came.

The public in general only hears of labor’s interest in one or
another measure before Congress. But few stop to think of the
pattern of a postwar program of which each of those issues
are a part. _

One of the most common arguments heard to knock down
almost anything which progressives propose, is the “econ-

21

 

  

 

omy” cry. No sooner did V-] Day arrive than the “economy
bloc” of Congress swung into action. The plain fact
is that within several days some $3o,ooo,ooo,ooo worth of war
contracts were cancelled to cover only a part of our expected
war bill. The ﬁnancing required for every measure progres-
sives suggest would take only a fraction of the money saved
by the early victory. When it was announced that the atom
bomb project cost the United States two billion dollars, statis-
ticians revealed that if the war is shortened only nine days,
the cost would ‘be -cancelled.

The battle against depression and starvation is part of the

struggle that ended with the military defeat of fascism. We

should not spare at least a part of our saved war expenditure
for that battle. .

Brieﬂy, the proposals progressives and labor are stressing,
are:

MURRAY-PATMAN FULL EMPLOYMENT BILL (S. 380-H.R.
2202). This bill, becoming a major issue in the legislative
battle of reconversion, aims to establish the basic principle
of government responsibility for a planned policy to prevent
mass unemployment. The government is required to conduct
a survey of economy to determine private industry’s capacity
to give jobs. Private enterprise would in no way be restrained,
but the gap left by it would be ﬁlled by government-spon-
sored work, so as to guarantee a job to everyone “able and
willing to work.” Secretary of Commerce Henry A. Wallace,
recently pointed out that never in its history has private econ-
omy guaranteed every worker a job.

President Truman, Wallace and a whole group of Senators
and Representatives, most consistent supporters of Roosevelt,
are backing the bill. But big business interests, the press and
the entire coterie of reactionary voices are rallying vigorous
opposition to it. These forces have set out to drive govern-
ment out of economy and they are certainly not going to give
in easily to legalization of the principle that the government
be a responsible factor in economy;

Immediately upon announcement by the President of his
support for the bill, the Committee for Economic Develop-

 

ment, chief capitalist reconversion organization, made‘ public‘

22

 

\

its ﬁndings on August 19, 1945, that by September, 1946, 53,-
448,000 workers would be employed in private enterprise.
This, the C.E.D. said, will just about give a job to every one
willing to work. Hence, government “interference” is un-
necessary. The survey was based on replies from ﬁrms stating
the number of workers they anticipate employing and the
value of goods they intend to produce, more than a year later.
How such a survey and estimate could be even attempted in a
capitalist economy of so great a country, was never explained.
How can any one of the thousands of employersquestioned
anticipate even approximately his business volume and num-

. ber of employees? .The future of thousands of plants wasn’t

determined. Many employers could not even state with cer-
tainty what they will produce. The very essence of capitalist
economy is a planless free-for—a1l rampage for proﬁt, wherever
investments will yield them.

The C.E.D.’s survey, handed to the public with publicity
fanfare, was represented as something that couldn’t be ques-
tioned for accuracy. It was obviously arranged to give the
public rose—colored glasses of the future. The object is all the
more suspicious in view of the wave of struggle that is gather-
ing momentum in the ranks of the working class for real re-
conversion measures. The C.E.D.’s entire line of propaganda
during the war years has been building up for precisely the
conclusion it drew after V-] Day. Its spokesmen, largely typi-
ﬁed by Eric Johnston, President of the Chamber of Commerce,

have been harping on the theme that “free enterprise” has a

great future before it if only some of the “bad” practices of
capitalism could be cast off. The organization, its member-
ship a roster of officials of America’s most prominent ﬁrms,
donned a “progressive” garb and even issued appeals to labor
representatives to sit at luncheon dinners with them. The
C.E.D. even conceded that going back to our pre-war economic
level is to be sure of 15 million unemployed.

One can hardly doubt now that the real object of the

 C.E.D. is to cast off the stigma of bankruptcy that has been

branded upon the economics of the" Harding-Coolidge-Hoover
era._ The aim now is to give-that false prosperity another
chance by cloaking it with Eric ]ohnston’s “new era.”

The spokesmen of big business gave a clear indication of
their perspective through some of the testimony that they
offered at Senate hearings on the Murray-Paetman Bill. One
corporationspokesman ridiculed the very concept of full em-
ployment as “Sovietism.” Another argued that a reserve army
of unemployed is essential for “free enterprise.” All argued
that a government hand in economy is death to “free enter-
prise.” Actually, they all voiced confession of the bankruptcy
of “free enterprise.”

While the issue is being fought out in America, government
participation, and even control, in economy is .advancing
throughout the world at a rate undreamed of several years
ago. Nationalization of banks and mines was put forward in
Britain after the Labor Goverment was voted into power. Na-
tionalization of many basic branches of economy has already
taken place in most countries on the European continent.

The people everywhere are no longer frightened by the
label of “socialism” or “communism.” What does frighten
them is the prospect of another round of unemployment and
wars. As Roosevelt told his Chicago audience in 1944.: '

“Our policy is, of course, to rely as much as possible on
private enterprise to provide jobs. But the American
people will not accept mass unemployment or make-
sh_ift work. There will be need for the work of everyone
able and willing to work—and that means close to 60,000,-
000 jobs.”

SEVERANCE PAY: The idea of lump-sum payments to work-
ers upon dismissal is an old one and has long been recognized
in a number of ﬁelds. This is the very least that men and
women who have been uprooted from their regular pursuits
and even from communities, to become war workers, deserve
upon sudden dismissal. This demand has been raised but,
in general, it is ignored by corporations that have laid aside
huge sums from their wartime incomes ostensibly as allow-
ance for machinery depreciation and other such considera-
tions. They were particularly Jiberal at government‘ expense.
But they have no interest in the man or woman who is ‘forced
to cash war bonds a week after layoff.

24

 

 

Strange as it may seem, the conservative New York Times
actually gave sympathetic editorial thought to severance pay.
But there was a catch. It was to be a cheap sop to keep down
the rising tide of labor struggle for a whole\series of longer
range proposals.

WAGE STANDARDS: Both the C.I.O. and A. F. of L. raised the
demand for a 20 per cent increase in the general wage level
to maintain take-home wages at least as they stood on the eve
of V-E Day. C.I.O. President Philip Murray pointed out that
this increase would only compensate for the rise in the cost of
living. He noted that in addition to the cost of living factor,
workers remain unpaid for an estimated 10 per cent increase
in productivity of labor that was achieved in the war years.

Despite much business-inspired propaganda on high war-
time wages, earnings even in the higher-paid categories, were
largely a reﬂection of overtime, shift differentials, incentive
forms, promotions brought on by labor shortage and shifts to
higher-paid industries. V-_] Day meant the end of all thatand
a slash for many workers of as much~as 50 per cent of their
earnings, when they fell back to straight—time,wages for 40
-or less hours at their old occupations. A coalminer, for ex-
ample, forced down to his regular 35 hours from his war-
time 54-hour-week, falls to $35 a week from about $60. The
dollar an hour base pay he earned in 1941, still stands.

A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE: The 40-cents hourly minimum
of the Fair Labor Standards Act has long ago ceased to provide
a real ﬂoor under wages. Even the wartime 55—cent minimum
the W.L.B. invoked in some cases, proved inadequate. Labor
is now concentrating on a bill in Congress to raise the mini-
mum to 65 cents. (S. 1282-H.R. 3841.) Rapid enactment of
this amendment could be of great help in holding up the gen-

‘ eral wage level.

A minimum scale affects all wage categories. An employer
cannot escape paying a differential for varying degrees of
skill. The inadequacy even of_ a 65-cent wage is evident from

_a War Labor Board Report in January, 1944, showing that

16,000,000 or 60 per cent of the 27,688,000 workers under sur-
vey, earned less than 85 cents an hour. The U. S. Department
of Labor estimated then that $34 a week, or 85 cents an hour,

25

 

'32.».  —

   

on an all year round basis, was the minimum “bare sub-
sistence” budget for a family of four. Prices rose and earnings
dropped since then. Eleven million workers earn less than
65 cents.

GUARANTEED ANNUAL WAGE: President Roosevelt, shortly
before his death, named a committee to study the practical
possibility of introducing guaranteed annual wage agreements
during the reconversion period. The principle is supported
by both the A. F. of L. and C.I.O. It simply means that work-
ers are guaranteed by the company 52 times their straight
time earnings for a regular week. This proposal has found
favor even in some employer circles who recognize certain
advantages to the company even though there is a risk in
event of idleness. There are also some employers who try to
twist the idea into a means of cutting wages, too. Labor’s
growing interest in a guaranteed annual wage, is a further
step in the struggle for security and stability of employment.
A study of the few cases where workers are covered by guaran-
teed wages, shows that the general economy of the given area,
too, is stabilized. _

HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE: President Truman,

recommending that Congress enact an increase in jobless in-
surance beneﬁts to $25 weekly for a maximum of 26 weeks,
‘stressed it as an “emergency” measure. He pointed to the
threat of sudden mass layoffs and the effect they would have
on the general purchasing level. Present jobless insurance
rates, vary from minimum weekly payments of as little as $2
(Alabama) and as much as $10 (New York) to maximums of
$15 in most states with several states offering as much as $2 5.
The number of weeks varies but the average nationally is
about 16. The average insurance check in 1943 was $13.84.

Congress ignored the President’s requests and ran off for a
prolonged 1945 vacation. By the time the legislators were
assembled on September 5, even though their ﬁshing trips
were cut ﬁve weeks, millions of workers were already laid off
with only the antiquated insurance rates to fall back upon.
The President’s proposal, now a bill (S. 1274—H.R. 3891),
would extend coverage to some 15,000,000 workers who are
now ineligible to any beneﬁt checks, among them government

26

 

 

workers, seamen, and employees of non-proﬁt and small es-
tablishments.

EXPANDED AND IMPROVED SOCIAL, SECURITY. The Wagner-
Murray-Dingell Bill (S. 1050-H.R. 3293) has been pending for
nearly two years. A showdown is bound to come soon. Early
in 1944' there were over a million workers over 65 eligible to
retire but did not do so because payments are so low. At the
same time, our draft records reveal the appalling state of the
nation’s health. The Wagner Bill aims to expand social
security to some 15,000,000 more workers; increase old age
beneﬁts substantially; reduce retirement age for women to
60; provide medical aid and hospitalization; increase sur-
vivors’ payments and temporary disability beneﬁts.

This program, ﬁnanced from payroll deductions, opens tre-
mendous possibilities especially in a ﬁeld with great expansion
prospects. Sizable numbers of persons now on the labor mar-
ket would be retired, as they should be, and old age would

_lose much of its terrors. The health program would get under

way, construction of hundreds of hospitals, laboratories, medi-
cal universities, dental clinics, etc., and open a great ﬁeld for
many professions.

It is indeed a sad commentary upon our civilization that the
war on disease is ﬁnanced from a few crumbs of charity or
endowments from philanthropic rich, while billions are spent
for research of means of destruction. In the very week that
the world learned of the two billion dollar atomic bomb
project, Alfred Sloan, president of General Motors, announced
a $4,000,000 donation towards a cancer institute. This was
viewed as a great event since such a large sum is seldom avail-
able for medical research. .

But the most generous of corporation presidents, even in

‘ days when high taxes cut such generosity to a very low price,

can hardly compete with public resources. The program in
S. 1050 is a big step to make health and real security a na-
tional responsibility—one that is not subject to the gambles of
“free enterprise” or the hearts of philanthropists. Big busi-
ness inﬂuence in the ﬁeld of medicine and drugs has raised the
cry of “socialized medicine” to arouse prejudice and opposi-
tion to the Bill.

MISSOURI VALLEY AUTHORITY (S. 555-H.R. 2203). This pro-
ject, even greater than the Tennessee Valley Authority, is an
undertaking for Hood and erosion control, power and new
farms in nine states. This is just one of the seven river valley
authorities which Roosevelt envisioned. Private interests have
neither the resources nor the proﬁt incentive that they need,
to even conceive of so great a project. But much private in-
dustry could be busy and many /thousands of workers could
work for such government undertaking. Farmers look for-
ward to it. The power trust opposes it as it opposed T.V.A.

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE COMMITTEE (S. 101-H.R. 22 32).
The right to work is meaningless unless the right to obtain a
job without discrimination because of race, creed, color or
national origin is guaranteed. The F.E.P.C., even in its
limited wartime scope during the war years, has helped greatly
to break down ancient hiring bars. But, should V-] Day
mean restoration of those bars? - "

Reactionary forces are counting much on division among
the people and exploitation of racial strife. This is why
their Senator Bilbos and Eastlands ﬁlibustered the F.E.P.C.
off the Senate floor. If the great American coalition for prog-
resspis to include the Negro people, a permament F.E.P.C.
must be one of its main objectives. _ The C.I.O. recognizes
this and has led the struggle for the measure.

Tied closely with this measure is the Marcantonio Anti-Poll
Tax Bill. As on every issue for years, the Southern reactionary
bloc in Congress is the main obstacle to a constructive recon-
version policy and a progressive industrial South. Poll tax
legislators were mainly responsible for the defeat of the Kil-
gore Bill and of the efforts to raise unemployment insurance

pay. The issue therefore is not alone the injustice to Negro

and white voters in the South, but the condition in eight
states which makes it possible for the likes of Bilbo and East-
land to be sent to the Senate.

TAxEs BASED ON ABILITY To PAY: The war turned every
wage worker into a heavy tax payer. Now big business is
maneuvering to keep the load permanently even upon the
backs of those who are on substandard levels. The struggle
over taxes looms to become one of the major postwar battles.
28 .

 
 

Peacetime budgets, it is predicted, will run to $25 and $30
billion dollars annually. _

Big Business spokesmen have already taken initiative in that
battle with the argument that unless taxes are cut drastically
for business, there will be no incentive for investment, and
business expansion. That this is false was shown both in the
years before, and during the war. Higher taxes under Roose-
velt’s New Deal did not discourage the rapid revival of busi-
ness. The highest taxes in America's history, during the war,
did not prevent the unprecedented proﬁts. »

Business enters the postwar with a nest-egg of some $20 bil-
lion salted away for reconversion investment. First relief from
taxes must come for the workers who have been depriving
their families of basic needs to pay their tax bills. In taking
up the struggle on this issue, labor could undoubtedly win the
support of the great mass of American people, including small
business.

PUBLIC WORKS FOR PROGRESS AND JOBS: V—] Day caught the
Federal, state and municipal governments unprepared on pub-

, lic works. Some cities, like New York, more advanced than

others, have actually planned projects. But little is beyond
the blueprint stage. Where all plans are complete, ﬁnancial
snarls, land purchase and _legislative details must be straight-
ened out. Where local governments have the money, there is
still a question of learning how much the Federal government
would contribute.

Not in many years were localand state governments so well
ﬁxed ﬁnancially to launch extensive projects. Little was built
on local public funds for four years, because neither labor
nor materials were available. Meanwhile, heavy tax payments
swelled treasuries as never before.

Closely connected with the demand for jobs is the serious
deterioration in municipal and state services, especially in the
schools, hospitals, libraries, transportation and utilities. The
war has actually retarded our progress in public services. The
struggle to ﬁll the great gap is one that is closely related to the
whole question of reconversion and economic expansion.

 l{llCONVEl{Sl0N  

By GEORGE MORRIS

Will I Have a Job?

“Will I keep my job?”

“Does it take a war to give me a right to work?”

Many a million workers put those and similar questions.
And they asked them during the very hours that America was
swept with delirious V-_] Day celebrations.

The “crisis of peace” hit as suddenly as the Japanese sur-
rendered. Large numbers were informed by radio or wire not
to return to work. Others were paid off within several days.
Still others simply found the plant gates shut and a sign in—
forming them where to receive their last pay envelope.

Then came the terrifying newspaper headlines: “Five
Million to be Laid Off in 30 Days,” “Eight Million Unemployed
by Spring.”.Papers gave special recognition to shutdowns of
large local plants. ' V

As all this-was going on our Congressmen were scattered at
ﬁshing and bathing beaches.

This was the ﬁrst jolt to our 39 million families "for they
had been absorbed in postwar plans of their own. The very
idea of ﬁghting to rid the world of fascism was associated with
a dream of a better home and future.

The average wage earner, farmer or small business man,

doesn’t think in terms of staggering national income statistics.»

His homemade plans are pretty much limited to the range of
his own modest income. Now, as he views events that resemble
so closely past depression preliminaries, a dark cloud threat-
ens even that limited perspective.

The American worker's mind has become very sensitive to

3

 

 

  

1,000,000 housing units annually, is a big step to ﬁll a great
gap. The 1940 census revealed that 37.4 per cent of our urban
and farm dwellings were sub-standard—requiring major re-
pairs, without ﬂush toilet or bathing facilities. Housing de-
terioration continued during the war years. A recent survey
revealed that 27 per cent of New York City dwellings and
37 per cent of Chicago's were built 40 or more years ago.

High rents, juvenile delinquency, disease, and other social
dislocations, are by-products of the serious housing shortage
in the industrial centers. The housing program, with its po-
tential 3,000,000 jobs at the site of construction and at fac-
tories, is one of the great hopes of postwar America.

Those are only a number of the measures upon which labor
is concentrating its strength. There are others to help small
business through credits and assistance to purchase from the
government’s vast store of surplus commodities. Also meas-
ures to break down tariff barriers so foreign trade and credits
could be stimulated and our shipping used to a maximum.
An important step in that direction is the President’s proposal

to cancel the $42 billion lend-lease debts and thereby clear _

the path for unprecedented foreign trade. Labor has al-
ready played a big part in approval of the Bretton
Woods agreement to stabilize world currency, .stimulate
world trade, help rebuild devastated lands and advance others
industrially. Labor has also had a big inﬂuence in passage
of the G.I. Bill of Rights which provides jobless beneﬁts, edu-
cation and business opportunities for veterans. Finally, re-
membering that the steepest rise in the cost of living occurred

- after World War I, the labor movement is pressing for con-

    

tinued price control until the danger of a further rise passes.

Is Labor in Shape +0 Meef fhe Challenge?

Is organized labor prepared for its postwar role?

Is it prepared to meet an open shop onslaught, wage cuts
and unemployment? Is it able to give leadership to great sec-
tions of non-working class people who have much in com-
mon with labor? ‘

Labor inﬂuence and strength is unquestionably greater to-
day in the United States than it has ever been. But to over-

30

look weaknesses that are still retarding the labor movement
is to invite the same kind of disaster that hit us after the last
war. Those weaknesses both expose labor to the attacks of
reaction and impede its effectiveness in the battle of reconver-
sion.

Labor is divided.

Progressive America has already suffered much because of
the C.I.O.-A. F. of L. division. It is generally conceded that

’ a representative of labor would have held at least one cabinet

post if there hadn't been a division. Organized labor’s ab-
sence» from any direct part in U. S. government affairs stands
out particularly now when all over the world labor is becom~
ing a major participant in postwar governments.

Division continues in labor ranks despite basic agreement
on practically all the major domestic issues that concern
labor today. World events do not wait while labor leaders
search for formulas upon which the C.I.O. and A. F. of L.
might unite organically. This was recognized when the war
emergency hit us and C.I.O. and A. F. of L. leaders found a
basis for at least joint cooperation on various problems affect-
ing the war effort. The emergency brought on by the struggle
of reconversion is no less pressing for joint labor action.

During the latter course of the war, the controlling A. F. of
L. leaders cooled to cooperation with the C.I.O. The climax
came early in 1945 when C.I.O. President Philip Murray sug-
gested joint action on the very problems that occupy labor’s
main attention today. William Green rejected the proposal
on the claim that only “organic unity” would be acceptable,
and by “organic unity” the A. F. of L. leaders mean C.I.O.
submission to their control of the “house of labor.’’ As a re-
sult the C.I.O. and A. F. of L. have been even more apart
in the recent period. ’

Back of A. F. of L. policy is the predominant inﬂuence of a
group that has long been looking forward to reconversion as
a period in which the C.I.O. may be weakened; Those forces
undoubtedly viewed with satisfaction ‘the ﬁrst layoffs which
appeared to hit the C.I.O.’s industries more heavily. Instead
of unity, they prepare to wage a new series of jurisidictional
wars against the C.I.O. In this View they have a common

31

ground with the National Association of Manufacturers and
other reactionary groups that are aiming attacks upon labor-
in the ﬁrst place upon ‘its most aggressive and progressive sec-
tion, the C.I.O. " -

The same mentality guides the controlling groups in the
A. F. of L.—-Mathew Woll, William Hutcheson, David Dubin-
sky and associates—that shaped their minds in the postwar
twenties. They then prostrated themselves before reactionary
forces and became their lieutenants against the most militant
and progressive section of labor, in exchange for an empty
recognition of their few unions of skilled craftsmen. This is
the mentality that caused them to stab in the back the great
steel strike of 1919 led by William Z. Foster who managed to

‘ at least loosely bring togetgtcr some of the craft unions for a

counter-offensive against the open shoppers. The same mind
divided and betrayed the railroad workers in 1921 when their
organizations, strongest of labor, were smashed. The same
“meeting of minds” with reaction caused John L. Lewis to be-
tray the miners in 1919 and send the United Mine ‘Workers
on a road that left it a skeleton by 1933.

The general membership of the A. F. of L; as that of the
C.I.O., does not want another era of labor-employer collabora-
tion, of the sort that we had in the twenties, when labor’s in-
terest was sold out and ’racketeers had their heyday in the
unions. This is, indeed, the “Century of the Common Man”
as Wallace put it, and labor, conscious of its leadership in this
period to all progressive mankind, cannot even think of look-
ing back to the twenties for a perspective. Joint action of all
labor forces is a must if labor is to march forward.

Organize '|'he Unorganized

Organizing the unorganized is part and parcel of labor’s
entire strategy both for a constructive reconversion policy and
in strengthening itself against the planned attacks of reaction.
Workers, no longer feeling the protection of the W.L.B., and
more exposed than ever to uncertainties, will flock to unions.
This "is the time to open the dqors _and throw, in all resources
for organization work. The concept that unions must fall in
strength after a war and during layoffs, is false and has no

32

    

 

     

room in a modern labor movement. A sweeping organization
drive, with the A. F. of L. and C.I.O. at least; agreeing not to
engage‘ in jurisdictional disputes, would be the best defense
against an open shop drive. In this connection it is well to
take warning in the sudden upsurge of activity by John L.
Lewis’ District 50 “catch-all” outﬁt and of various company
union elements dressed up as “independents.” Their object
now, as during the war, is to disrupt labor’s ranks and divert
it from a constructive course. »

Poliﬁcal Acﬁon

Labor is only beginning to show its effectiveness on the po-
litical scene. Experience during the war and developments
in every country are ample evidence that political action by
labor in conjuction with its allies, could be decisive in de-
termining events. It was decisive in the United States in No-
vember, 1g44, when Roosevelt’s re-election saved the country
from a reactionary conspiracy to seize control. Chief credit
for that great victory for the people goes to the C.I.O.’s Po-
litical Action Committee—the most far-reaching advance U. S.
labor has ever made in organized political action.

Nevertheless, past narrowness and opposition to political
action still hinders much of our labor movement, particu-
larly old"-line affiliates of the A. F. of L. In the very same 1944
campaign we still saw the disgraceful spectacle of A. F. of L.
and Railroad Brotherhood endorsement for Rankin, Dies,
Stephen Day, Hamilton Fish and others of their ilk.

Furthermore, too much of our labor movement is still
dominated by the concept that political action is an endorse-
ment of politicians at campaign time. Effective political ac-
tion is the sort that expresses itself every day in the year

‘through a watchful eye and an aggressive inﬂuence upon the

lawmakers and administration, demonstrations, mass meetings,
petitions, delegations to Washington and other such forms
when emergency issues arise. ‘

Government inﬂuence in economy, already great, is bound
to become even stronger in coming years. Even a labor union’s
limited economic bargaining interest is retarded without po-

33

i i

  

litical action. The battle of reconversion and the future that
depends so much upon it is, in the main, a political battle.

World Securify and Labor

A peoples’ reconversion program is impossible in an inse-
cure world. A world in constant fear of new wars does not
give much attention to constructive and long range programs.
Resources go for means of destruction. What the next war
would be like was well indicated in the one that just ended,
especially its last few days.

Recent experience has gone a long way to convince our
working class of its international interest. Labor has become
a vigorous force for a policy of international security and sup-
port of the San Francisco Charter. But here again. hangovers
of the past, especially with the top leadership of the A. F. of
L., are a great drawback. This has shown itself both in asso-
ciation of A. F. of L. leaders with hate-Russia and anti-United
Nations forces, and their opposition to world labor unity.

The C.I.O., on the other hand, has played an active part in
the formation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, rep-
resenting 60,000,000 trade unionists of almost all countries.
The unity of the working class and the pooling of its experi-
ence and strength on problems of world interest, -is viewed by
the C..I.O. as a bulwark to world peace, security, and postwar

reconstruction.

Labor-Managemenf Relaﬁons

The problems of strikes and lab0r—management relation-s
have again come forward after V-] Day. No responsible labor
leader or union member wants strikes, whether they be in
peace or in war. Reactionaries have been whipping up a strike
“threat” atmosphere after V-] Day with the obvious object of
laying a base for legislation to hamstring unions. The Ball-
Burton-Hatch Bill, advanced as an “industrial peace” measure
to “help” reconversion, is a sample.

At the same time, Senator Vandenberg and others whose
proposals must be always viewed with great suspicion, sud-
denly began to beat the drums for a labor-management code

34

 

 

in peace. This proposal smells much like the no-strike schemes
of the twenties. Those schemes had only the effect of disarm-
ing labor. There is, of course, nothing wrong in labor and
management coming together on proposals that would hold
strikes to a minimum, just as negotiations for union agree-
ments have that object. But in the latter case unions receive
deﬁnite assurances and wage standards. A mere, machinery
to settle disputes cannot eliminate strikes. Basic agreement,
guaranteeing collective bargaining, adequate living standards,
and steady employment, could.

In the absence of such fundamental guarantees, organized
labor, by tying itself to a peacetime no-strike machinery,
would, in effect, sign. its own death warrant. Class collabora-
tion illusions are always dangerous, especially at a moment
when big business is sharpening its open shop dagger.

Struggle for Negro Rights

The problems related to the struggle for Negro rights con-
front labor with another crucial test in the reconversion
period. As this is being written hundreds of thousands of
the Negroes hired during the war period have been ‘dismissed.
This was bound to be the consequence of seniority rules since
Negroes were among the last hired. The good will labor or-
ganizations won among the Negro people through the war
years may be wiped out within months if labor fails to ﬁght
vigorously in defense of the economic gains Negroes won in
recent years.

It goes without saying that the A. F. of L.’s tolerance of
unions that still bar Negroes and its refusal to support a per-
manent F.E.P.C. which would also penalize unions for dis-
crimination, isn’t raising labor’s prestige among the Negro
people. But the C.I.O., with its ﬁne record of struggle for
Negro rights, is held in high esteem.

Reactionaries, of course, have their race inciters in readiness
and they hopefully await every opportunity to sow division
between black and white. Their real target is the entire labor
movement. Organized labor’s only answer must be a more
vigorous ﬁght than ever for a Negro’s equal right to a job
in all ﬁelds, including‘ the skilled categories. The test of this

35

 

 
  

is -not a resolution but the practical steps that will bring re-
sults now, while reconversion is on.

Unions and the Unemployed

Unemployment, which Reconversion Director Snyder pre-
dicts will be at least eight million by Spring, 1946, confronts
unions with a serious organizational test. The tradition as
carried forward by the A. F. of L. is to forget an unemployed
worker. The policy is basedon the concept that men and
women should be encouraged to get out of an industry. ‘ This
is a policy of self-abuse.

With the ‘bulk of the union membership organized within
six years, it won’t take much to encourage unemployed to
leave the unions—and even turn against unions. The lesson
of the last depression is that unions must struggle for the
unemployed as for their employed members. Otherwise, anti-
labor forces will ﬁnd ways to organize the jobless. Unions will
undoubtedly ﬁnd it necessary to organize their unemployed
as part of the union, to meet and be active. Interest will
center on reopening of idle plants, speed in reconversion,
severance pay, ‘more adequate unemployment insurance, pro-
jects, shorter hours, etc.

Veterans and Labor

Reaction is pinning much hope on veteran-labor strife.

When Rep. Rankin sponsored a bill exempting veterans
from adherence to a closed shop contract, he gave away the
strategy of his -pro-fascist associates. Those who shout for a
“super—duper” unlimited seniority for veterans have the same
object. Labor has the great task of showing the veterans that
the main support for the G.I. Bill of Rights, came from labor
and now the unions are pressing for amendments to raise mus-
tering out pay and liberalize loans for business opportunities.

The veteran must be shown that ‘the solution of the prob-
lems of all people—whether they be veterans, or others—lies
in the people’s reconversion program of which labor is the
leader. In this respect the three million unionists in the
armed services have a big pari to play. Cooperation between
veteran and labor organizations will also defeat the professed

36  

 

 

friends of the veteran in the ranks of reaction. Chicago's first
reconversion demonstration, a parade led by veterans wearing
citations, is an example.

Women and Labor

»The challenge to labor is just as serious as it faces the
problem of women workers. ,Millions of women were added

. to payrolls and they entered numerous ﬁelds that were re-

garded as beyond the reach of the “weaker sex” in past days.
Women have surpassed men in many ﬁelds of work.

The notion that women will go back to kitchens was a com-
forting thought to some old line craftsmen, but survey after
survey proved that a large percentage of women intend to keep
working. Wives of men killed at the fronts or disabled, will
have to keep working. And many a woman may be at work
while her husband is unemployed. -

The‘ﬁrst wave of layoffs was largely at the expense of wo-
men, due mainly to seniority rating. But labor leaders who
think the unemployment problem could be solved at the ex-
pense of women are making a serious mistake. That kind of
an attitude only plays into the hands of the anti-union em-
ployer who will seize the ﬁrst opportunity to pit the lower-
paid women against the men and the union.

Our more modern unions have recognized this and the
changed composition of the workers. Their Work changed.
Education, recreation, and all types of services were intro-
duced in the union’s life. Women were encouraged to take
union oﬂice. Their special problems and the principle of

equal pay for equal work, are given much attention. The

“men only” unions will ﬁnd sailing very difﬁcult in the re-
conversion period. '
Those are only some of the problems. They all add up

to a serious test which will decide both the future of organ-

ized laborand the course of reconversion. The most impor-
tant conclusion is the growing realization that labor’s interest
is not a group interest. No section of the population is more
in accord with the national interest than the workers—espe-
cially the organized workers. In taking up the ﬁght for all
those constructive measures that have become its postwar pro-

gram, labor marches on with the victory banner that our men
carried on the battlefronts.

The Real Answer Is in S’rruggle

As this is written, a week after Japan surrendered, the men
and women who were among the ﬁrst to be laid off and among
the ﬁrst to cash in their war bonds and ease off on spending,

are providing the answerto the future. Thispis in the mount- '

ing wave of struggles.

Public square demonstrations, parades, factory gate meet-
ings, petitions, delegations to lawmakers and government oﬂi-
cials, strikes, picket lines, are among the kinds of activities
that have sprung up everywhere. And they are only an indi-
cator of what is to come. '

Demands, at ﬁrst, are of the more elementary and imme-
diate type—severance pay, higher unemployment insurance,
greater dispatch in unemployment insurance oﬂices, and pro-
test against the policy of U. S. Employment Service ofﬁcials
of requiring workers to take lower-paying jobs or lose jobless
insurance.

Very soon, however, workers begin to see the relation of
those demands to all the others that make up the peoples’
reconversion program. Pressure increases for ' passage of the
Murray Full Employment Bill, for government operation of
idle plants and for government action against corporations
that are deliberately slowing reconversion on a claim that
price-control does not allow them a high enough proﬁt.

The inﬂuence of the common people will be felt in the
battle of reconversion only to the degree that labor displays a
militancy and mass pressure. Reactionaries are counting on
a belief that ‘four wartime, yearsunder a no-strike pledge and
a policy of labor-management cooperation to win the war,
has dulled labor’s ﬁghting spirit. They should soon ﬁnd out
that labor has grown in vigor as in strength. They should also
learn_that labor leads in struggle not only workers, but middle

. class, farm and professional people as well.

Moreover, it should not be forgotten that even those in
government and positions of inﬂuence who do follow a pro-

38

 

 

 

\

gressive course watch labor’s strength, vigor and unity as a
barometer for the extent of their own action._

Today, as America’s working class once more stands at the
fateful crossroads, it is well to heed the words of a veteran
ﬁghter of lab_or, Chairman William Z. Foster of the Commu-
nist Party, who recently rounded out a half century of active
work and leadership in the labor movement. Foster led those
forces who fought militantly against powerful odds to block
the reaction that came after World War I.

He sees the same reactionary forces unfolding the same
pattern that spelled disaster last time. He reminds us that
Hitler received encouragement and support from big capital-
ists of Britain, France and America who even now try to “re-
solve their capitalist contradictions” along the path of fascism
and ultimately another war. He further warns that the "‘most
powerful concentration of reactionary danger” is in America.
Big business open shop interests here, greatly strengthened by
extension of their monopolies “are determined to register this
strength in‘ imperialist world domination.”

But Foster also sees the greatly increased strength, experi-
enceland political inﬂuence of the labor movement which he
stresses is the main force that could challenge reaction. Writ-
ing in The Worker of Sunday, September 2, he says:

“Organized labor must, therefore, directly challenge the
propaganda of the monopolistic ‘free enterprisers.’ It
must show that their policies would lead to disaster for
the American people. It must demonstrate that govern-
ment intervention in industry, along the lines proposed
by labor, is indispensable. It must prove that its pro-
posals to provide relief for the unemployed, to maintain
the purchasing power of the workers and to assure gov-
ernment-provided jobs, are essential right now and cannot
be postponed until some mythical period of ‘prosperity’
that the monopolists and their agents tell us is coming.
Only by such a bold course can the present -dangerous
complacency of the people be liquidated and the masses
made to be truly aware of the threatening economic situa-
tion now confronting the country.”

our economic vibrations. Some eight million were still un-
employed when Pearl Harbor was struck. The majority of
the low-incomed families have felt the scourge of depression
some time within the past 15 years to the extent of depen-
dence upon as little as the charity under Hoover ‘and as
“much” as a WPA wage under Roosevelt.

“Are we going back to that?”

“Can everybody work only if the government invests 90
billion yearly in war supplies?”

As the worker wonders and takes stock of four years of war,
he retraces -thoughts that have crowded his mind since his
ﬁrst war bond purchase. Perhaps it was a hope to have enough
after Victory to buy a home—one he could really call his own.
Or it could have been the dream of getting out of the slums
and moving into an up-to—date apartment, modernly equipped
and furnished with those nice appliances that are so beauti-
fully featured in magazine ads.

Or, his chief interest might have been in growing children
for whom a college education and a professional goal was the
great hope. Untold numbers have set their sights on those new
shining postwar cars. A‘

One need only glance through Department of Commerce
statistics to see what people are thinking of. Only half of
America's 37,000,000 occupied dwellings are owned by their
occupants. Forty per cent of the homes have no mechanical
refrigerators. More than a third of the homes have no private
baths. The ﬁgures run similarly for washing machines, modern
kitchen equipment, furnishing, etc.

But, the closer the worker came to the days when his dreams
were due for realization, the more disappointing his experi-
ence was. Long before V-E and V-] Days, a process began of
sapping the worker’s savings, earnings and purchasing power.
The sharp decline in overtime pay was the ﬁrst installment
of what was to come. That alone made a difference whether
a worker would or_ would not make his wartime ends meet.
A cut from 48 hours to 40 meant a slash of about 25 per cent
of a worker’s earnings.

Then came the early cutbacks and a rise of unemployment
in areas which only a few weeks earlier were held by the War

Manpower Commission as “tight” labor markets. The search
began for work in civilian ﬁelds where much lower wage
scales prevail.

Already in the month of April, when ﬁghting was still on.
in Europe, the Department of Commerce revealed that in-
dividual incomes dropped 4 per cent compared to the previous
month. This, reﬁecting mainly a fall in workers’ incomes, was
the heaviest drop for a month in six years. The following.
month showed another 2 per cent drop.

Along with this drop in earnings came a new jump in the-
cost of living. The black market spread to become decisive in
some ﬁelds. The “Little Steel” formula held down the general
wage level to not more than 15 per cent above the standards
in 1941. Even the much disputed Department of Labor Statis-
tics index and the “correction” conceded by the War Labor
Board, admitted a cost of living rise of some 34 per cent by

‘ V-_] Day. A joint A. F. of L.-C.I.O. survey showed this rise to

be closer to 50 per cent.

The worker didn't need to consult statistics to realize that
reconversion was off on the wrong track. He felt it from his
own or his neighbor’s experience. ,

While the worker was the ﬁrst to feel the trend of -‘our
economic course, other groups were soon to feel the inevitable
effects. The Department of Agriculture estimates that if farm-
ers are to obtain 100 per cent parity on their products, which
means a return equal to cost and subsistence, at least 56 million
Americans must be earning wages in industries. The same
study reveals that farm annual income would range from $9.3
billions if two million were jobless down to $3 billion if 17
million were out of jobs.

Small business people and merchants are sure to feel the
consequences of declining purchasing power of wage earners.

Thusthe right to work and earn a decent livelihood is the
very foundation of a market and an economy that could pro-
vide a high level of employment.

In Sight of a Second Bill of Rights

The dream of a better future is not just an aimless hope
within the conﬁnes of each of our millions of homes. The

5

  

outline of a New America has been taking more deﬁnite shape
as a people’s hope the closer we came to Victory day.

Organized labor had been steadily becoming more con-
scious of its leadership in such a people’s program. Powerful
voices have helped to put this program before the people of
America. Above all were heard the voices of the late Presi-
dent Roosevelt and Secretary of Commerce Henry A. Wallace.

Roosevelt was not a spokesman for labor. He was really a
progressive upholder of capitalism, given much to the concept
that further capitalist expansion would be possibleonly if the
purchasing power of the mass of people would be lifted. His
interest in the welfare of the common people earned him the
undying hatred of the big monopoly business interests, whose
policy of expansion results in the squeezing out of smaller
business and an increase of poverty.

Roosevelt and Wallace point to a “new frontier” of eco-
nomic expansion based upon ﬁlling America’s great economic
gaps, especially the needs of that great section of the popula-
tion that is “ill-fed, ill-housed and ill-clothed.” They further
hold that private industry, itself, is unable to steer economy to
a path that leads to progress and real expansion. The govern-
ment must have a big part in ﬁlling the ‘‘valley of un-
employment.”

Although the program is advanced as one through which
capitalism could “work,” it coincides closely with the immedi-
ate objectives of the working class. It is a perspective that does
rest in large measure on the hopes and plans that have
been shaping in the homes of workers, farmers, sharecroppers,
and professional people.

The historic document which sets forth this policy is the
famous “Second Bill of Rights” which Roosevelt asked Con-
gress to approve in a message in January, 1944. Its eight points
follow:

“1. The right to a useful and_remunerative job in in-
dustries or shops or farms or mines of the nation; ' _
“2. The right to earn enough to provide enough food
and clothing and recreation;
 The right of every farmer to raise and sell his prod-
6

 

 

ucts at a return which will give him and his family a
decent living; .

“4. The right of every business man, large and small,
to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair com-
petition and domination by monopolies at home or
abroad; '

' “5. The right of every family to a decent home;

“6. The right to adequate medical care and the oppor-
tunity to achieve ‘and enjoy good health;

"7. The right to adequate protection from the eco-
nomic fears of old age,-sickness, accidents and unem-
ployment;

“8. The right to a good education.”

This was implemented in later speeches and directives by
Roosevelt,‘ especially in his Chicago, 1944, campaign speech
when he raised the slogan of “Close to 60,000,000 jobs.” That
goal, he said, must be reached if our economy is to be “suf-
ﬁciently high to replace wartime government demands.”

The Roosevelt perspective drew its main impetus from the
common people, particularly from the organized workers.
America is now in motion for objectives that were undreamed
of in the past.

We talk of building 1,500,000 housing units in each of the
next ten years. Only government aid could advance a slum-
clearance and development program on that scale.

Two out of every three farm houses have no electricity, and
82 per cent have no running water inside. In the South, less
than 10 per cent of the farm houses have inside running water.
The vast $700,000,000 Tennessee Valley Authority is an ex-
ample of the type of project that could furnish the power to
modernize the farm and home. Today there is talk of seven
such valley projects. ~

We have begun to realize how woefully deﬁcient we are in
education. A vast part of our population has no access to
schooling, which accounts for 10,000,000 native-born illit-
erates. More than 2,000,000 boys and girls, it is estimated are
taught in one-room one-teacher school houses. We still have
100,000 such schools.

The health picture is worse. We are now thinking in terms

7

  

of a gigantic Federally-sponsored health and hospitalization
program which would greatly stimulate the construction of
the needed hospitals, dental clinics, laboratories, pharmaceu-
tical establishments, and open vast new vistas for professions
in these ﬁelds. « . 3

Our concept of what constitutes a substandard wage level
has also begun to change. When the 1938 Wage-Hour Act and
its initial twenty-ﬁve—cents _an hour took effect, mill owners
in the South raised a howl that they face ruin. Their dime-
an-hour bloc in Congress fought tooth and nail against enact-
ment of the law. But the mill owners lived to make greater
proﬁts than ever and pay the legal minimum of forty cents
and wartime minimum of ﬁfty-ﬁve cents an hour. Now there
is an effort to raise the minimum wage to sixty-ﬁve and seventy-
ﬁve cents. '

The False Cry of "Socialism"

America’s monopolists, having fought with all their power
against the social reforms that have been carried out under
Roosevelt, now gird their strength for an even more vigorous
struggle. They view the Roosevelt postwar course as “social-
ism.” The same label, it will be recalled, was pinned on laws

to guarantee collective bargaining, wage minimums, social_

security, unemployment insurance, etc. The object now, as
then, is to confuse and divide the people and weaken the
ﬁght for the “right to work.”

The Communists are the ﬁrst to point out that the Roose-
velt perspective is not socialism. It rests primarily on private
ownership of the means of production and their operation for
proﬁt. Nor is it a guarantee against the cyclical depressions
which have marked capitalism since its dawn. Communists
have always pointed out that as long as the means of produc-
tion are privately controlled, and proﬁts are the chief driving
force in our economy, production is bound to outpace pur-
chasing power and factories are bound to come to a standstill.

The one real remedy against depression is socialism. This
is a system under which the basic means of production are
socialized. Industries are operated and planned by the govern-
ment with the working class, working farmers and men and

 

 

women of the" professions and sciences, in political power.
The country’s entire economy could be planned under such
a system. The purchasing power of the people _rises along
with labor productivity and technical progress.

The Soviet Republic, in the twenty-eight years of. its his-
tory, gave us vivid evidence of how‘ socialist planning does
prevent depressions and raises living standards.

The specter of unemployment does not worry the Soviet,

people as they pass to reconversion. Neither is their take-home
pay threatened despite return to the pre-war eight-hour day.
Before the war, the U.S.S.R. carried out successfully three
ﬁve-year plans of unprecedented economic expansion. In those
very years, other countries, including our’ own, have lived
through a chronic crisis.

The fundamental change to socialism, however, is not an
issue before Americans today. A socialist perspective is ‘not
yet within close enough range to be comprehended by the
majority of Americans. B_ut all progressives in American life,
whether they be Communists, or those who believe that all
contradictions could be solved w_ithin thelimits of capitalism,
do agree, that the perspective outlined by Roosevelt, if really
carried out, would greatly cushion the effects of a depression.
It would lessen unemployment, prevent serious decline of
living standards and shorten crisis periods.

The ultimate objective of socialism neither contradicts nor
excludes the struggle to achieve every possible advance under
capitalism. The same principle held~when Communists led
the struggles of the early thirties for unemployment insurance
and social security and when they became exemplary ﬁghters
in the war against fascism.

This is why the main resolution of the Communist Party’s
July, 1945, convention stresses the possibility to create “the
kind of national unity for theipostwar period which will be
able to facilitate the destruction of fascism,” and it adds:

“Therefore, it is essential to weld together and con- _
solidate the broad coalition of all the anti-fascist and
democratic forces as well as all other supporters of
Roosevelt’s anti-Axis policies.”
