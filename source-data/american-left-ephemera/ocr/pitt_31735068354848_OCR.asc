' Carlsbad, N. Mex.-—To a mem-

ber, the Workers of Carlsbad
Potash Local 415 have voted to

mobilize full support to the Steel- ‘

workers in the present fight.
“It is clear to us,” they" said,

““as' members of another union in

I "another industry, that the steel

companies are acting as the

jagentsof all major segmentsof

jlj.American industry in an at-

-tempted economic and political .
.:drive against the whole labor

movement itself and against the

 "living standards of all American
‘ _ workers.”

n They also pointed out:
1“The steelworkers have not

F had a wage increase or other im-

,_ provements in their contracts for

over two years. They still do not‘

have any paid holidays.’ They

.have been forced to go on strike

I  ‘for these things by the big steel

companies.” ,
In its resolution, the local

I S. branded certain members of Con-

’ ‘business in the latter’s attempts

gress and certainagencies of the
government as “tools” of -big

to‘ launch‘ broad attacks against

the rights of all ‘labor.

DENVER——“Complete sup-
port"-for the steelworkers in
their new strike was announced
by the four officers of the Inter-
national Union.

Describing the Wage Stabiliza-
tion Board settlement recom-
mendation ’ as a‘ “rock-bottom fig-
ure,” the Mine-Mill officers ex-
pressed the hope that “the steel
workers will ‘not return to work’
for one fraction of a cent less
than this minimum.” .

“The outcome of the steel
strik.e will affect the bargaining
power of every union, just as our
victory of last ‘year helped ‘pave
the way for other unions. ,

“We call upon our local unions
to give every possible form of
help to the striking steel workers
in their localities, including fi-
nancial aid and help on the picket

lines,” they added.

Theofficers’ statement: _

Our union is completely in support of the Steelworkers in their strike.
We call upon our local unions to giye every possible form of__help to the
striking steel workers in their localities, including financial aidand help
on the picket lines. ‘ ‘ _ _

In this period of wage freeze, manufactured hysteria and un1o_n—bust-

ing, the fate of all unions; all working men and Women, is more closely '

linked than ever before. The outcome" of the steel strike will affect the

bargaining power of every other union,'just as our victory of last year-

helped pave the way for gains made by workers in many other industries.

The long and futile course“ that the Steelworkers case has taken
through government agencies‘ and the courts amply proves that reliance
on supposed “friends" in Washington is a dead-end street for labor. The
dispute. is now back in the realmof ‘collective bargaining. Only through

their own collectivepaction ‘and the aid of other organized workers can"

the men who make the steel get a ‘larger share of the great Wealth they
produce. .

The settlement recommended by the W. S". B. was a rock—bottom
figure."‘We' trust that the’ steel workers will not return to Work for one
traction of a cent less than this minimum. _

We are with you, men of steel. In ‘labor unity there is strength——-

I strength to break the wage freeze and free ourselves of the Taft-Hartley

slave labor law. _ - '

,. SUDBURY, Ont.—Spurred on
by the victory of the contract
miners of Kimberly, B. C., the
miners“ of Local 598 are deter-
minedto win a voice in operation
of the bonus system used by
INCO (International Nickel). '

The Kimberly _ miners have
doubled their bonus earnings
after a battle that lasted many
months.

The giant INCO has stubbornly
refused to open up the question
of the bonus system, and has now
taken to bargaining in the news-
papers with the “public” rather
than sit down and talk straight
with the men who bring the
metals-—and profit——out of the
earth. The company is placing
huge ads in the local newspaper,
in which ‘it tries to present itself
as more than generous to the
contract miners.

'0 LIKE MANY big companies,
INCO operates the bonus system
under the theory——“you do the
work, and we’ll do the thinking.”
If the company lets. in a little
light on how it figures the bonus,
it will have to release some of
those fat profits to the men who
do the work and risk their lives.

In special articles in the-local
union paper, the union has been
exposing just how the company
has been abusing the miners.

Brother Nels Thibault, District 8 a

Board Member, recently stated:

“The old ‘71c miner’s rate has/A
inc1'eased from time to time and ,.
now stands at $1.71‘/2. Each time’

the miners’ wage rate increased
THERE WAS NO CORRES-
PONDING INCREASE IN THE
CONTRACT BONUS RATES.” '

And Thibaiilt went on to show:

“Difference in contract miner’s
bonus earnings as a result>of the

company NOT having adjusted-

/

 

voice in bonus deal  

the contract rates each time the
wage rate was increa-sed meant
A LOSS TO THESE CONTRACT
MINERS OF $445.90.?’

If the company really wants
to ' bargain with the “public”
thl'ough the newspapers, it might
tell them who owns IN CO, where
the profits go, why the workers
in Canada were deprived of a ‘an-

ion for so many years, and so
on. The public would get a real
education, and would realize once
again that only higher wages help
the Sudbury community; after
all, the men of Wall’ Street don’t

spend their profits in Sudburyx

fo hear president Clark T

NELSON, B. C.—The Kaslo Units of
Local 901, Nelson & District Mine and
Mill Wo1‘kers Union, held a combined
membership meeting in Kaslo May 11.
Members came from The Cork Pro.-
vince, Whitewater, Kootenay, Florence
and-Yale to meet Int’l President John ‘
Clark. \ .

Brother Clark gave a very enlighten-
ing address on conditions throughout
the International. Explaining the un-
just manner in which Mine—Mill had

been expelled_from the C.I.O. and how

the C.I.O. Steelworkers raids still
plagued the Mine-Mill membership up-
setting bargaining and retarding the
progress of many locals. ,9

' Brother Clark dealt at some length
on the all important question of peace,
defending not only the might of him-
self as an individual but also the
right of this union, to stand firmly on
the question of peace, pointing out that
the old Western Federation of Miners
stood for peace, and that Mine-Mill al-
ways had and always would strive for
world peace and trade, for the better.-‘

" ment of not only our own workers but

also the workers of the world. ' ‘_

President Clark explained that al-
though International executives were
unable to visit the smaller'lo.cals as
often as they would like, the Interna-
tional was nevertheless ever mindful
that the smaller locals were an im-
portant part of the life blood of the
International Union.

with morale high and everybody happy

Horton Perry, manager, and the east-

that they will not deal with the work-
ers as long as Jim Sockett, local ‘secre-
tary, ‘is on the bargaining committee.
If they maintain that stand, the High-

ture around the mountains on fishing.

turned from the hill after their spells

of scrutineering during the vote, which
lasted two days.

“The results of the vote were known

at 3:15 a. m. Thursday. From midnight

voices of all rose in unison—‘Murphy
is our leader, we shall not be moved,’
then the same for Brother King.
“Brother Murphy made a short
speech, saying that the vote was not
a vote for Communism, since that was
not the issue. It was a vote for good,
clean unionism, the kind Mine-Mill had
championed since its inception. Then
Brother, King, thanked all for their
courage and hard work. . '

someone shouted—-‘What in the do

been up all night, when ‘the bulletin

was ready they all wentup the hill to _ ‘

against laugh A employer front

VANCOUVER, B. C.——N,egotiations havebeen
stalled into conciliation by the majority of the com-
panies in this province, and boards are being set up

all over. the area.

, The tough front of the operators conforms to
the pattern set by the Canadian Manufacturers
Association, and is apparent in all industry,-the
International Woodworkers having been offered a
ten percent cut in wages when they asked for 35
cents in-crease. Similar adherence to the “Hold the
Line” CMA policy has been experienced by hotel _
employees, packinghouse workers, fishermen, the

shipyard unions, and others.

Some locals, such as the quarry workers at
Texada Island, have been offered five cents, and
others have had last year’s wage agreement plus
certain fringe improvements offered to them.

This “Hold the Line” slogan is mouthedkby
‘spokesmen in the Federal government, Finance Min-
ister Abbott having stated the other day that any
further increases in wages might do

Canadian economy.

BUT ANOTHER government department, deal-
ing with housing, reported last week that “it is
almost impossible for a worker earning less than
$64 per week to buy his own home.” The average

[Canadian wage is only‘ $53.91 weekly.

The government is also cooperating with the
bosses tltrough the phoney cost of living index,
which, supposed to have been reorganized after the
Mine-Mill-United Electrical analysis some months

down in a very dejected mood. Then
Percy Berry, vice-president of 480,
asked Charley Millard if he believed in
democracy. To this Millard replied,
“It depends on what kind of democ-
racy.”-

Berry said “You have had your vote
and lost it, now why don't you people
stop disrupting. and leave the workers
in Trail to run their own a‘ffa’irs.”

Big Charlie then stated that no one
was going to tell him what to do, that
if he wanted to stay in Trail he would
stay as long as he pleased.‘ Another
member of the Mine-Mill delegation
then asked him was that why he had
rented the office space for another

three years. Millard then said that they _

had: rent_ed the office for three years
and that it was nobody’s business.

At this point Mr. Gargrave told the

and that there was‘ no "need for the

the Mine Millers to “Shut up and listen

Berry said “We have listened to your
propaganda for the last three years
and we have had enough and as decent
people‘ we ask you to" act like an honest
man and leave the workers here to
carry out the job of building honest
trade unionism.” Berry, then told the
Mine-Mill delegation “I think we have
heard all we want to hear from these
people and their intentions are plain to
all of us, so let’s gwol fellows.”

As the" last Mine-Mill delegate was

going out the door, old Giargy picked‘

Profits, of course, are skyhigh, and almost
every industry showed gains for the first three
months of 1952 over the same periodof 1951.

But concurrent with this is the undisputed situ-
ation of many thousands of unemployed —- 70,000
estimated in this provincealone out of a total popu-
lation of a million. ’ -

THIS CONDITION, is intensified by the‘ many
thousand displaced persons brought over here thru
glowing premises. The majority of these men are
nowthoroughly disillusioned, andvthe unions find
that even the minority who were reluctant to join’
unions at first are eager’ to do so _now.

The bosses, of course, are relying on this ‘re-
serve labor pool to‘ break down the unions’ demands‘
for a wage to meet living costs, and to ultimately
break the unions themselves. ~ 0 -

Mine-Mill as usual is in the forefront of this
struggle to wrest a little oftheir profits from the
mines and smelters, and as in-the past will continue
to give the lead to all B.C. industrial workers, who,
however much some of their reactionary leaders.
decry us, are always watching what the miners do.
They know,’ as do Mine-Mill members, that 1952 is

  ON THE -OIFFENSIVE

Three bills to kill your union

The Slnith BilI—H. R. 7647

L ET us suppose the Smith bill has be-
come law. A union goes into negotia-
tions and demands higher wages. The

. boss says no. The union takes a strike
" vote.

The President .of the U. S. thereupon
declares a ‘‘national emergency” and

i the Attorney General must (he has no

choiceunder this law) get a court in-
junction preventing the strike. (Sec.
18a)

The Norris-LaGuar'dia Anti—Injunc-
tion act is repealed. (Sec. 1.8b) So the
strike is prevented for 80 days.

THE PRESIDENT then appoints a

board of inquiry, but this board cannot
exert any pressure for a settlement.

Itris forbidden to make any recom-

mendations and its report “shall con-
sist only of a statement of the facts

, with respect to the dispute and each

\

party's own statement of its position.”
It is even forbidden to make “any find-
ings,as to which party is at fault.”
(Sec. 18b) This will prevent any board
of inquiry from possibly helping any
union. A .

After 80 days the property of both

. the company and the union" is put in-
. definitely under court—appoint receiv-

,. ers. The sole function of these receiv-
' ers is to keep the strike liroken—or

break it if it starts.

The receiver appointed to hold the
p1‘a;n,t “shall have no power to change
the terms and conditions of employ-
ment from those in effect at_ the time
of his appointment”. (Sec. 1”'8 C (b)).
I-Ilis receivership is limited—to strike-

breakingx M

‘For example, he could not take over
the funds or earningsfof the plant.

Power to break strike
"The receiver put in charge of the

“ union, however, is unlimited, in his

 ' ' mines, or facilities in question.” (Sec..’ K
 _ 18b)

power to" break a strike. He “shall
have full power to manage and operate

T  such.property'* [theunion] to the ex-

tent necessary to prevent such proper-
"ty [the union] from being used in aid
of any concerted interference with the
continued operation "of the plants,

Thus, hecould takeover. every pen-

ny which might be used for strike -bene- ‘

fits. ‘He could seal up any union build-
ings:and strike kitchens. He could stop

, publication of the union paper.

.. ‘SEC. 18 (c) of the Bill would make
it unlawful and criminal contempt of

, «court “to coerce, instigate, induce, con-
aspire’ with, or encourage any person,

 
   
 
 
  
   
    
   
   
  
    
     
  
  
  
  
  

 

 

to interfere by lockout, strike, slow-
down, concerted absences»f1_:_om. work,
or other interruption with the opera-

 _ tion‘ of’ such property.”

Ittwouldr be unlawful to aid any such

_. I strikeby giving direction or guidance-«
' * to it, or by-providing funds’ for strike
_.-benefits, or any other benefits to such
 strikers. (Sec. 18c)»

f- fThis would shut off aid from 

outside. ‘‘ It would jail every worker

who» went on strike and every trade‘

18d) ,

While all this happens under the
proposed Smith Bill, under the present
Smith Act, the union leaders may

a“conspi'racy” to conduct a “political
They may very well face a
court trial like those occurring under
the Smith Act today.

/' This.is why all union have opposed

the new Smith bill. /

William Green said that “in all my
years as President of the AFL, I have
seldom seen a more shocking proposal.”

The CIO said it would “destroy the’
trade union movement.”

 

Big Business is on the offensive.
1952 has been chosen as the year to break. the power of orga-

nized labor.

The three bills described in this article are a part of the overall
plan. It Big Business can have its way, there will be no more national
bargaining, no mpre national unions, no more unions —— except

company unions. .

It Big Business has its way, the boss can control your life off the

- job as well as on the job_ — what you read, ‘who you know, what
organizations you join, what you talk about. I

.Don't let it happen! Fight for your rights! Start by seeing that

your local union, (1 lot of your memb_ers, and other organizations to

which you belong, demand that the two of these bills before Con-

gress be voted down, and that the one already passed be vetoed

by the President.

Send telegrams or letters to your Senators and ‘Representatives

‘’and to President Truman.

The McCarraI1 Bills

 I975 and S. 2543  

THESE bills embody most of the pro-
posals now being pushed by Senator

‘ Humphrey, Secretary of Labor/Tobin,

the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, the
National Association of Manufacturers,
General Electric Company and other
big employer interests.

In the guise of “hunting Commu-
nists,” these bills would:
u Give to the employers the legal

' power to control the lives of work-‘
ers while they are off the job as well
as on the j . ‘

Both, bills have an identical provision
as’ follows:

“(‘d) Nothing in this Act or any
-other ‘statute of the United States
shall preclude an employer from dis-
charging WITHOUT LIABILITY an
employee who voluntarily continues as
a member of an organization duly
designated by -the Attorney General of
the lUnited States as subversive, —or
who has actively concealed his member-
ship in such an organization, or-WHO
HAS REFUSED TO STATE TO A
DULY CONSTITUTED CONGRES-
SIONAL LEGISLATIVE COMMIT-
TEE WHETHER OR NOT HE IS OR
HAS KNOWINGLY OR WILLINGLY_
BEEN A MEMBER OF SUCH AN
ORGANIZATION.” (Emphasis burs.)

THIS MEANS your boss can tell you
what organization you may belong to.

Almost any.» organization your boss
doesn’t like is on the Attorney Gen’-

— eral’s “subversive” list. -

It means that your employer can
fire without liability any worker who
belongs to onexof‘ the many, many or-
ganizations on the Attorney'General’s»
list. (“Without liability” means that no
union action could be used to have the
man rehired.) "

Where wﬂlffhey stop?

This. provision p_laces_.in the’ hands

\

of any employer the right to police ‘

and ‘punish the private actions. and
opinions of employees while they are
off the job.

It is thus an attack on the civil rights A

of all workers, on their right to join
whatever organizations they Wish.

Since the/definition of “subversive”
is so broad, workers may be afraid to
join any organizations——even unions.—-
for fear of losing their job. One of the

_prim_ary objectives of the Humphrey

proposals is to place certain unions on
a subversive list. While they may start
with so-called left-wing unions-—-where,
will they stop-‘.7 Every union is “left”
of I the employers and. their agents in
Congress. '

Now suppose the un-American Com-
mittee comes to town to do a smear
job on your union. Let us say you are
subpoenaed to testify.

You will probably be asked: “Are
you a member of the Communist
Party?” If you say “NO,”-then the
next question is “prove it.” How can
you prove you’re not a Communist?
If you once contributed money, or be-
longedgto any one of the scores of or-
ganizations later called “subver—sive”—-
then you run the risk of being charged

' with perjury.

. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT to the
Constitution ,g.i’;.v<e‘s ; you  protection

 migrants look at,

. MW
...,gge/av:

against"self-incrimination. You can’t
‘be forced to say “yes” or “no” if you
feel it may lead to placing you in
jeopardy. 

~/-. The phoney theory of “guilt by as-
sociation” has been used to place so
many persons in jeopardy, andin pris-
on, that many, perhaps a majority, of
witnesses before the un-American Com-
mittee _refuse to answer, questions.
Their right to do this has been upheld
by the courts.

»Now comes Senator McCarran to

destroy this Constitutional safeguard.

by permitting your boss to fire you
“without liability” if you refuseto co-
operate with those who try to” smear
you. Under terms of this bill, you
either incriminate yourself or you’re
fired. C’

These bills therefore deprive workers
of their freedom‘ to hold their own
political views or engage , in political
activities’ of their own choosing. In
‘effect, each worker wouldlhave to be
cleared by, a government agency to be
able to "hold a‘ job. ‘

These‘ bills would also: _

_‘Deprive-workers of the freedom to
choose their union. A government
committee would be set up to determine
which unions are “approved” and which
are “disapproved.” Only those “ap-

tive bargaining rights-» _ ~ -    

Another provision calls for extension‘ ‘

of Section 9H of the Taft-Hartley law‘ ~  * 

and would set up machinery for the. H 
government to make up lists of ‘“ap-f’ 

proved” and “disapproved” ‘candidates

for union office, and for exclusion of
“disapproved”. candidates. '

BOTH the
ord against these proposals.

CIO President Philip Murray, on Jan- I
uary 9, 1952 wrote
stating:

“We believe that if the government
undertakes to determine What unions

‘can represent workers in this country,
it will have embarked upon thetlong.

trail» toward government control of-‘:4
unions. In the dictatorships of the
world, unions exist at’ the. sufferance
of thestate. We in America do not it
want toltake a single step in that direc-
tion.” '

AFL President William Green wrote;

Senator’ Humphrey on November 16, 

1951: '

“No legislation‘ of any kind whatso'- '
ever is necessary in order to prevent
any of these unions being dominated
by Communists. Workers are moved
by the spirit of voluntarism . . . legis-
lation would serve to substitute com-
pulsion for voluntarism.”

I HE McCarran-Walter Bills are often
4 ’ referred to as _“America’s Nurem-

fp-:V\V,,;.1n)urg law.” They follow the pattern of

5Hitler’s racist Nuremburg act, one of
the basic foundations of Nazi law.
(Since the two bills are practically

L identical, the analysis here refers to
. the McCarran b’lll—-—S. 2550.)

This bill would effectively destroy
‘the civil rights and customary legal
protections of all aliens and of millions
-of naturalized citizens. It does this by
granting to the "Attorney General
dangerously broad powers of search,

. seizure and inquiry into the habits, as-
 sociations, and thoughts of millions of

persons who are not even accused of
any crime.

“‘ "This could and would be used against
foreign-born labor leaders as well as
workers- whoptake part’in' any kind’ of
militant action.

_ THE RIGHT of American citizens to
becimmune from search or questioning
without a warrant is ended. Any car
or (vehicle within a “reasonable dis-
tance” of Mexico, Canada, or the At-
Ilantic or Pacific Ocean may be searched
without’ a warrant (Sec. 287(a)(3));
any citizen may be questioned if an
immigration official believes him to be

. an alien. (Sec. 287 (a) (1))

Naturalized’ citizens are made sub-
ject to denaturalization, if any private
informer files an affidavit, for acts

which were not grounds for denatural- .

ization when they became citizens.
(Sec. 340 (a)) , .

It would reduce naturalized citizen

‘to a second. class status, subject to

survelliance, harassment, persecution
and even deportation by the Attorney-
General. A

A racist bill

The bill would, for all practical pur-
‘poses, limit immigration to white,
skilled and semi-skilled workers from
certain countries populated by so—called
“racial stock” acceptable to McCarran

See. 202 (b) of the Bill establishes a
special inferior status for any person
“attributable by as much as one half
of his ancestry” _to Asiatic races, re-
gardless of his citizenship or country

At present, the large quota for Eng-
land may be used by any person born

would limit immigration from each of
these dependent areas to 100 per year.

Most dangerous to labor are the de-
iportation provisions. Many labor ‘lead-
ers have been persecuted and even de-

been deported to the British West
Indies. »

The broad grounds for deportation
set up in the McCarran Internal Secur-
ity Act of 1950 and prior laws are
broadened
which would: .

(1) Abolish existing statutes of limi-
tation in deportation cases, and allow

‘ deportation for alleged acts fifty years
past, as to which no witnesses or docu-
ments are available (See. 241). A

(2) Authorize deportation of immi-

grants who are mistakenly classified
-as “public charges” (whereas present
law allows deportation only if the im-
migrant is correctly classified as a
public -charge). Sec. 241 (a) (8)

(3) Authorizes deportation of im-
migrant b-rides or bridegrooms who fail
to fulfill marital agreements “to the
satisfaction of the Attorney-General
(Sec. 241 (c)). [How the Attorney Gen-
eral is supposed to satisfy himself on
this question is not described in ‘the
bill.]

(4) Establish numerous other grounds
for deportation, some of which are
trivial (including traffic offenses under
Sec. 241 (a)_ (4) of S. 2550) and others
which are in such vague language as
to preclude any possibility of judicial
review (See. 241).

(5) Makes all grounds of deporta-

tion retroactive‘ to cover all immigrants 1.-

who have ever been admitted to the
U. S. (Sec. 241 (d)) 

The result of all these provisions
would be to subject about ten million
foreign-born Americans to a special
police regime operating without regard
to due process of law as we have known
it in the past. It represents an immedi-
ate danger to all unions.

No matter how badly we want the

wage boost——and that we surely do be- »

cause their present wages and condi-
tions are a drag on all labor—it would
be a mistake not_ to « recognize the
danger in this seizure businesswhether
by “inherent power” or by statutory
authority. This fact stands ‘out: If the
President can seize an industry and, in
the national interest, order improve-
mentpin wages and conditions, then he
can also in the national interest seize
an industry and, order the reverse,
that is,'he can order wages cut and
conditions worsened. -— I L W U Dis-

rusuc MASTERS

In his dissenting opinion. on the con-
stitutionality of the Feinberg law, per-
mitting the discharge of “subversive”
"teachers, Justice Black said: “Because
of this policy, public officials cannot
be «constitutionally vested with powers
to select the ideas people can think
about, censor the public views they can
express, or choose the persons or
groups peo.ple can associate with.

‘Public officials with such powers are
not public servants; they are public
masters.” These Words of Justice
Black serve to point out that in our
fight to kilhcommunism there is a
danger that, in looking back some
day, we,will _,discover we have sacri-
ficed some of the principles we held

TGo3v'i- figures hide,..}.... 

real living costs

WASHli_\’GTON—-Official g o v e 1% n-" ,
ment figures used in the Wage freeze" 

   

program are hiding 36per cent of. the K.’

rise in living costs since January, 1950,

and defrauding American factory Work- .

ers of at .e.'-.::t 12 cents an hour.

That charge is made by UE l’regi.
dent Albert Fitzgerald in connection-
with release of the UE’s cost-of-living

index for January, 1952. The US issues ‘
distorted Bureau of Labor Statistics in»
its own index for comparison with ;the-' _~
index on which both the wage -freé.z"e- ‘H

and escalator clauses are.based.

While BL-°.' figures indicat ca 14 per 0

cent rise since January 1950, UE fig‘-
ures show the actual increase was more
than ‘22 pe- cent. TheUE’s index stands

at 282.4, while BLS’s in/dex reg_iste1:8* '0

only 191.3. '

A UE’s INDEX measures increased‘fed- ,
eral taxes, used car prices and the cost‘

of home ownership, none of which are’

touched in the BLS surveys. UE meas- if-I
ures lowlcost foods, clothing and other

‘articles bought by workers which in-

crease more, rapidly in price than theft’

more-expensive items used by BLS.

Most of the 3.1 per cent s|)u~1=t;. in?

living costs in the last three~mon'th‘, ‘

period was due to the sharp increase"-p
in taxes last November. Clothing and*

furniture prices stopped climbing be-

cause workers didn’t have the purchiis--.

ing power to -buy and sales slumped,
but this
ther increases in food prices, rents, gas
andcars, combined with higher taxes.

J V » SUBJ5 URY, Ont.--Greeting: the report of Brother‘ A'sbury‘How'ard ‘ P

withstanding ovations, thousands of Mine—Mill members here voted
full support to the Jonesboro Defense Fund.

In the days of slavery in the United States, Canada was the‘; haven

forthousands of Negro slaves who escaped via the underground rail-
road to the fields of Canada, where no fugitive slave laws could return

them to bondage.

, And Mine-Mill members ‘here “showed, during the Howard visit,

that the treatmentof the Negro people, especially in the Deep South, ’

is a threat to them and their union’s existence.‘ ( Brother Howard is
Mine-Mill Regional Director in the Alabania-Mississippi area and must

.' face trial in the Deep, South" fordefending his life and union against

terror attacks by Steel fanion leaders. ) . -

A new and deeper pride in .:Mine-Mill arose. as thousands of".

workers listened to Howard’s description of theway the Steel union
behaves in the Deep.So.uth. Workers crowded around _Howard after
the meetings to pledge their support tb the Jonesboro fight.

Brother Howard expressed‘ his opinion that the workers in Canada
showed akeen interestin the problems of workers in the Deep South.

‘_‘They seem to ‘show a ‘deep interest here in the unity of all workers,
in all lands,” he said. .“Many' workers asked me how such things can ‘ —-

go on as they do in_.the South; and I tell themthat if we all speak up,

we can end this situation.”‘
