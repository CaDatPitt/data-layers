After -hearing an openingreport by,

Inunities. The reports showed, despite
"h'igl1‘prodi"Iction’ in some plants, a grow-

ing trend towards layoffs in both -the

 coppeiusmelting and brass fabricating

gindustry, hundreds of layoffs, even
_shutdowns, in other industries.
THE DELEGATES reported on dis-

cussions with their Congressmen and,

Senators, one or two of whom showed

sympathetic interest while the maj_0rity

indicated neither knowledge of the sit-
uation nor any remedy forithe problems
of the metal workers. ‘

Many. suggestions were made by the -

Support was given to a bargaining

stand firm on demands

DANVILLE, Ill.—-Bargaining meet-
ings set by the Mayors of Danville and
three surrounding towns were discon-
tinued here as the Hegeler- Zinc Com-
pany management showed an attitude
of f‘I'efusal to bargain” in the 6 month
long strike of Mine-Mill Local 209.

The Mayors of the cities affected by
the long strike brought the Union and
company together on January 13 in
an effort to get negotiations’ started
between the parties. The parties met
on the 20th with not progress being
made toward a settlement.

The Union had proposed that bar-
gaining commence as of the June 30
offer of the company and then the re-
maining difference be negotiated. The
Mayors heard the Union committee re-
veal the justification for" their demands
of wages, seniority and job protection,
vacations, holiday pay and joint ad-
ministration of the health and welfare

1 plan.

THE LO_CAL MEMBERSHIP has
witnessed the most anti-union tactics to
break a strike ever used in‘ the Dan-

-ville area. The company has used the

, junction
agents to split the workers’ unity, and.

hated “blacklist,” the Taft-Hartley i-n-
threat, company-sponsored

«other union-busting attempts. The com-

- pany has failed to crack the "morale and

fighting spirit of the membership.
Over three fourths of Hegeler Lo-
cal 209’s membership have 16 years

or moreservice with the Hegeler com-
»pany. Many have spent 40 or more

years of their lives at Hegeler Zinc.
The company demand to eliminate the

“temporary transfer” clause in the past»

contracts has angered and embittered
the membership because it means the
loss of their jobs -and senior-ity—rig'hts.

EARL RILEY, president of Local
209, publicly announced that ‘ ‘the
Hegeler Zinc employees went on strike

almost six months ago for -those de-
,mands’__" and he said, “We still think.

we should have those things and.,I do

r not think we will change our minds in
‘the foreseeable future.”

The strike began July 28, 1953, when
the company failed to meet the Un-

ion’s demands. _

BUTTE, Montana—--More than
1,700 -Butte‘ miners trudged» thru
the snow to the high school last
Sunday and broke the back of
the Mason brothers’ conspiracy
to turn their union over, to the
CI*O"Steelworkers. ' ‘ »

_’ They _took_ along ‘look at “what,

the" Masons ‘had advertised" as a
“revolt” and decided that the
only thing that had -happened
was that a handful oftraitorious

loca‘l‘Toffi‘ce1¥s_l1ad' quit’ Mine-Mill '

and gone to Steel.

action to kick the phonies out of
our -union hall. All "we need to
donow is to electnew officers

._aIid We’re in business.”

so THAT’S what the-y did.
And they set the machinery in

 motion for a referendum election

of permanent officers on Feb-
ru.ary 27; Nominations were to
begin January 31. ~ - G

j ‘They ‘also authorized Local 1
Administrator Ernest Salvas,
Mine-Millfs regional director, and
the inewly-el_e.cted officers, to
take immediate steps to bring

- about the election of ‘ mine’ com-

mittees and the revitalization of

the local’s entire grievance ap-
, paratus. _
' =Salvas and the new officers L"

likewise were authorized to

are. necessary to protect the
functioning of the union, the

 The new1y—elected officers of

secretary, John “Dixie” Shea;
custodian, Tony St. Peter; trus-

tees, ‘Perle , Watters, Dan Doland,

The offices of warden and con-
ductor were to be filled January
31. '

John “Gyp” Harrington re-
mains as secretary—treasurer._ He
was the lone loyal Butte local

‘ officer.

The local meeting on January

124 was the largest ‘held here in

many, years. V
ARRANGEMENTS had been made
to‘use_ only the main floorof the high

’ ‘school auditorium, but before meeting

time it was necessary to open the bal-
cony to accommodate an additional 500

- ~members of Butte Miners Union.

j‘~Most‘ of the floor discussion at the
meeting took place around the main

resolution to put Butte Miners Union

back into the hands of the rank and
file. It was during this discussion that
an organized Steel Clique. of 20 or 30
men attempted to use disorder as a

. means of breaking up the meeting.

tion continued, however, the crowd be-

JOHN ‘GYP’, HARRINGTON, old-time mem-

membership meeting‘ of Jan. 24'.

swered the Steel hecklers in biting
terms that drew cheers and applause.

Harrington tells why

Perhaps the highlight of the meeting
was an impromptu speech by Secretary-
Treasurer Hariington in answer to a
question as to why he wasn’t with the

‘rest of the renegade officers. 7 '

Harrington told the crowdhow‘ he
was approached by Nick Zonarich, no-
torious Steel hoodlum, and told that he
wouldn’t have to ever worry about

‘- nioneyi again if he wouldgo along with
the ,Mason sellout. _ _

Harrington told the miners ofhis in-
dignant refusal to betray the.-men who

. ‘had elected him. to office.; The. usually
mild-mannered Harrington was cheered
enthusiastically as he urged the miners
to stick with him in his stand against
the Mason gang. _ _

ALARGE GROUP in the hall urged
that the meeting march to the Miners
Union Hall in a body and “throw out
the-phonics.” Speakers, including Pres-
ident—elect Zorn andilnternational Pres-
ident Clark, however, urged the miners
to follow legal procedure in gaining
control of their property, whereupon a

motion was made to instruct the new‘

officers and Administrator Salvas to
attemp‘t to have the hall rpadlocked un-

til the issue was settledin the courts..,

Removed all doubt’

The four and a half hour meeting re-
movedall doubt in the city of Butte as
to who represents the Butte miners.
There were fewer than 200 members in
the illegally—called and conducted meet-
ing on Dec. 27 at which ‘tile.-Masons.

 

jammed through a double—barreled-
“secession” resolution. There were
more than»1/700‘ members present at
the official local meeting called by
Mine-Mill last Sunday. if

’ The Mason-McLean sneak attack has
lost its steam and the members of both

.Mine—Mill locals are enthusiastically

working to finishithe job of smothering‘
the raid completely.

THE STEEL CAMPAIGN has been-»
» reduced to continuous red-baiting, wild,
charges, and hysterical slander. The-
most popular remark around Butte and

Anaconda these days is:
‘ “Bill Mason has made the greatest
mistake of his life.”

And i_t’s,'true that Mason and the
Steel crowd were hoping to blitz their
way into a full-fledged secession move-

ment. What has happened is that the.

workers have seceded from Bill Mason.

(B. C.) Miners’

 

 

 

 

up of Clinton J encks moved to a

new ‘stage’ January 22 with con-
_' viction on two counts and two

five—year sentences, to be served
- concurrently. The two counts
. are membership and “affiliation”
W with the Comunistparty, in vio-

lation of a Taft-Hartley affidavit

signed April '28, 1950.‘ Appeal

, will be made in the Fifth Circuit 
"Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

Attorneys for the defense, in-'

‘.  eluding E. B. Elfers, president of ‘

the El Paso Bar Association,
stated emphatically that the gov-
ernment prosecutors failed com-
pletely to make a case. Innormal

 ' circumstances, without the lynch
' . atmosphere prevailing ‘here, such

an unproved case would be dis-
posed of by the judge with a

  directed verdict of acquittal.

Because the prosecution did
notpresent a case as required by
the rules of evidence, and be-
cause under American law a per-
son is presumed innocent until
proved guilty, the defense rested
after demolishing the credibility
of the witnesses and pointing out
that they had not testified on

 ‘matters relevant to the indict-

ment.

OF THE 13 WITNESSES, only
two dealt with the period of time
on which the indictment rests.
Neither of these even asserted’
any knowledge of J encks’ alleged

-Communist party membership.

Harvey Matusow, the P1’0f9S"
sional informer, ymerely said the
had seen J encks at a place where
“everyone there was , a Commu-
nist.” Such evidence was re-
jected by the U. S. Supreme
Court in its reversal of the case
against Harry Bridges.

So much for lack of evidence

Onsthe charge of “affiliation”,

——and noboidyknows just what

is meant by the term—Matusow

’ know

and another witness talked about
alleged opinions of J encks which
to them sounded like communist
opinion.

ON THIS, Matusow told an un-
believable story (see detail be-
low) about J encks boasting of

_engineering_a plot toﬁhamper the
Korean war by means of strikes .

in both the U.S. and Mexico. It
was not explained why he over-
looked Canada, South America,
Spain and Africa’. _

The other ,.w itn e s s who
talked about the period since
April, 1950, did not even claim to
J encks as a communist.
He_simply quoted Jencks on mat-
ters of union policy.

This was Jesus Terrazes, a
former member of Bayard Local
890 who was expelled in 1952 by
a vote of the membership for

anti-union conduct. The opinions

on w-hich he quoted Jencks—-
mostly opposition to the Taft-
Hartley act and its affidavits—-
are shared bymost union people.-

MATUSOW  

Matusow is the admitted perjuror
who took the stand in the Salt Lake
McCarran committeerhearing of Octo-
"her, 1952. Defense attorneys were able
to prove beyond question that ‘Matusow

_. has lied repeatedly under oath and has
- _‘;_1,_no1'e‘ than. once given false informa-
'tion when registering to vote.

. In the J encks trial Matusow repeated
what "he had said about J encks in

Salt Lake City——that Clint had boasted’

to him in 1950 that Mine-Mill was go-
ing to call a strike in. order to hamper
the Korean war. (In Salt Lake, Matu-
sow had said this was a copper strike,
and that it took place in 1950. Here,

. he was a little vague as to what metal
i. was involved; our union had punctured _

hisprevious story by showing that we
had no copper strike in 1950.)

Under cross -examination, Matusow
said Jencks had never talked to him
about strikes at all. 1

In cross—examination, Jencks’ defense,
attorneys were able to prove Matusow

- ii. repeated perjuror. For instance:—-'

" -—On October 13, 1951,’Matusow reig-

istered to vote in Bronx, N. Y., giving ,

his address as 1491' McComb Rroad.
-—In January of 1952, Matusow reg-
istered to vote in Dayton,‘ Ohio, swear-
ing to a year’s residence in that city,
at 1308 Grant Ave. The defense had
photost-atic evidence -that he ‘voted in
Dayton on May '6, 1952. g ,
r —-Oniseptember 12, 1952, Matusow
registered to vote ii1jNew York City,
signing an affidavit in which he swore

' to 26 years’ continuous residence in

New York City and the Bronx.

—In August, 1953, in connection with
a divorce suit, Matusow swore that he
had_ lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
for a year.

—-In September, 1953, Matusow testi-
fied under oath several times that he
was a resident of Dayton, Ohio.

Such false swearing is a felony un-
der U. S. law.

' In 1948, Matusow was employed by

the Jefferson School Bookshopiin New 

York; was fired for stealing books.

with Jencks. One, he said, took place
in Salt Lake City at the time of a.
Mine-Mill Wage Policy conference in
1947. He was sure of the time, he said,
because it was during that conference
that he, Peterson, made a trans—At-
lantic phone call to Senator Elbert
Thomas, asking him to fly from Ge-
neva, Switzerland, to Washington to
support President Truman’s veto of
the Taft-Hartley bill.

Peterson testified that all of those
at the alleged communist meeting were
delegates to the bargaining conference.

his testimony, Peterson ‘A still insisted u

that the MSR conference was the one
he meant. He talked vaguely about ly-
ing in his hotel room in his shorts and
remembering things he had previously
forgotten—or vice versa. .

‘ McTernan then introduced as an ex-
hibit the minutes of the February,
1948, Mining, Smelting and Refining
Conference in Salt Lake City, which
Peterson now said was the one he
meant. Part of the minutes was a list
of those present. The list did not in-
clude Gately, Powers, Hanson nor
Jencks—-nor did it include Peterson
himself. To back this up, the defense
had Peterson’s expense vouchers, which
did not show a trip ‘from his home in
Midvale, Utah, to ‘ Salt Lake City on

., any ofthe days of the conference.

FACTSIN THE JENCKS FRAME UP

 EL PASO, Texas—-The frame-

Bd. M ember Chavez commenfs
on .Iencks irial, SECESSIOII I

The Jencks trial was stacked from the start. The jurors were all business
men; not one was a worker or a Mexican-American. The press convicted Brother
Jencks before the trial. ’ V - .

The trial lasted 10 days, one witness after another was shown to be lying, but
the jury was only out for 22 minutes. A case of such importance to Brother J encks,
to our union, to the whole struggle for. civil rights and against hysteria, certainly
needed more time for any kind of fair consideration. ' __

Any union member who faced the same frame-up as Brother Jencks would
have gotten the same verdict. V  _

 

The Steel raiders, the state Attorney General and all the others helping them,
tried to get the members of Local 509 to 1-eave Mine-Mill on the basis of Commu-
nism. They stayed with Mine-Mill on the basis of bread and butter.

Actually, the vote on January 24 did not show the real «strength of Mine-Mill’
loyalty in the local. There were many members who started for the union hall for

that meeting but went home again when they saw a lot.of police around the en- ’

trance, and others who went in were afraid to vote. This was because of threat!
they had heard. A A . c
This fight is not over. The Editor of the Herald-Post has said in a front-page
editorial that he is going to keep on fighting Mine-Mill, and he is not speaking
just for himself. .. ’ i - V 1

  Why attorneys decided A
0 no defense witnesses

When the jury brought in its 22-
minute verdict, no one was surprised-
The all-out attack on Mine-Mill by the
El Paso papers, the Texas administra-
tion, the businessmen’s jury, the denial
of 99% of defense motions, all these
together made the Mine-Mill people
call the Jencks trial, a “lynching bee.”

Government witnesses included two
well-paid, self-confessed informers,-
who “turned friends names over to the
FBI,” two union haters, now on the '
other side of the fence, and two min-
ing company‘ supervisors. .

Any subversion? No one testified
that J encks "eversaid anything akin-to
treason. or did anything except fight
for the union, for veterans benefits,
and to‘ repeal Taft—Hartley.

Until the.._last hour the defense was
ready.’ But the failure of the prosecu-
tion to prove" its case made Mine-Mill

paid, professional informers, failed
completely to make its case. '

2. To place Brother Clint or any othe ,
union witness on the stand woul‘
open the door_ to more of the same"
stuff relied on by the prosecution to
make a case. Defense witnesses
would -be compelled to give theij
opinions about others, to ‘act as “in:

and affiliations of union men. There
would be no protection from charged
of perjury (as government witnesses
enjoy) or contempt, whenever union‘

deuce” presented by an informer-
who needs offer no proof to back u 1
his statements. Dozens of ’rank'"'ang
filers from Local 890 were prepare,
might have been a dozen frame-ups"
and character attacks instead of tone,-

formers,” to testify on the thinkin' '

testimony differed or exposed ‘_‘evi¢«_

to take the stand, but the result I

attorneys conclude that our union
should present no defense witnesses’.
They presented their conclusions to
Mine-Mill ‘rank-and-filers who were on
hand for ,_the trial, and asked for their

opinions. After discussion, everyone .

agreed.

George Knoff

_ Among the sfoolpigeons whose fesfimony against Jencks was discredited in cross-ex-

aminafion were the two pictured above. Knoff's own signed expense vouchers were
offered in evidence, showing he was of least 1,500 miles away from the scene of
an alleged communist meeting with Jencks. Confronted with this evidence, he left fho
stand in confusion. Eckerf's charges could be proven false. For example, he talked
of a Chicago meeting offended by Jencks iusf before fhe 1947 Mine-Mill convenfion
in Sf. Paul. Several members of local 890 who drove to that convention with Jencks

know that they ‘did not go through Chicago. lhe defense was unwilling to’ put these 1

potential defense witnesses on the sfcsnd and subject them to possible perjury charges,
if their testimony contradicted that of stoolpigeons, or penalties for contempt if they

, EL PASO, Texas—One of heaviest, most concerted, most cynical’
and ruthless raids in union history was fired at the AS&R smelter

workers here last week—and it failed. Local 509 voted to stick with
Mine-Mill, and elected new leaders from its strong, courageous rank
and file. ‘

 The - raid here had everything a cunning union-buster could

scheme up:

‘ _-—The Steel raiders offered bribe money to the local officers to pro-

mote secession; . .

--The FBI threatened reprisals against the officers unless they sup-
portedgsecession; ' f , e 

---Hysteria was blown ‘ up in Texas last month by a phony “anti-
Communist”, investigation of _a hotel-restaurant strike in Port
Art-hur;.Mine-Mill was -smeared with al wide-swinging brush;

__.The Texas Attorney General who conducted the “investigation”.
sentppublic appeals to the_me’n1bers of all three El Paso Mine-Mill

locals‘ to secede; ‘

-—The Governor’ of Texas gave out with red-baiting blasts;

——Some clergymen joined in the secession appeals;

—The secession move’ here was carefully timed to follow closely the

attempted raids in Montana and the frame-up conviction’ of Clin

Jencks here in El Paso; V c‘

——All of this was blasted at the people of El Paso almost daily for
over a month in huge, slugging page 1 headlines in the two daily,
papers and newscasts of the four radio stations. ‘

The story of how this careful1y—staged raid was shattered on
the rock of union solidarity is told below in the form of quotations

from several sources: A’ report by Int’l Rep. Maclovio Barraza; a, -

story in the January 25 issue of the El Paso Times (after the raid I

_ flopped, this paper finally printed I a story with some elements of;

truth) ; a statement by Board Member J. B. Chavez (page '4):
a telegram by presidents of two El Paso locals to the Texas Attorneyj
General; a report to local unions by Secretary-Treasurer Travis.

  ‘THEY HELPED

.S;f0ry 4% .91/1117 we//1. Ilgarraza‘

Excerpts from a report of the Local 509 raid by I nt’l Rep. Maclovio Barraza. A member of Tucson

Local .907’, Barraza, was working on organizing _camp'aigns in-Arizona until callecl to El Paso to help Local

/.509. p .

The secession leaders had a meeting

‘with Pooley, the editor of the Herald-

Post, and told him they were going to

secede and they wanted his help. A. . .'
5 They really stooped low in the eyes of
 ‘the workers, to go to the arch enemy of

the workers in El Paso and ask him for
help. ,
At a meeting with the Steel organ-
Aizers, .Silverio Alva (former business
agent and president of Local 509) took
some 12 guys and ‘said that these were
the guys that run the union and that
anything they said the workers at the
smelterwould do. ' A

The members raised questions—H_ow
come Alvaéhad always been strong for

 . the International Union and now that
"he had been removed as business agent

. he. wantedto secede? ‘ ,'

V We explained to the workers how‘

‘the Attorney General was out. to de-

stroy all unions, not just Mine-Mill. "We"
pointed out how he was anti-‘Negro and ‘

 

anti-Mexican, citing his telegram to
Alva and officers of the locals saying
“In view of the conviction of Clinton

Jencks yesterday by eleven of your,

fellow Texans, I urge you to join Local
509 in disaffiliating from the IUMM-
&SW.” He did not‘ consider the Negro
on the jury one of his fellow Texans.
We pointed out how this same At-
torney ‘General had just come back
from Washington where he argued that
it was all right for an all-Anglo jury
to convict a Mexican-American. _
During all this time the papers were
giving us hell, urging the workers to
secede and calling Alva a real patriot.

A The papers’ quoted Alva as saying he I

had asked for police “protection” at the
Sunday meeting because _ the Interna-

' tional was sending in red sympathizers

to take over- the meeting". This Alva
denied, and said he asked for police

‘because he wantedto have “an orderly A

meeting.” '

The result of having police all around

the entrance was that many members
turned around and went home. Other-
wise we would have had a bigger vote
to stay in Mine-Mill. There were two
policemen inside the hall.‘

Alva asked for a hand vote . . . the‘ ’

rank and file exploded. Carlos Becerra
took the floor and told Alva he was
railroading this vote, they were tired of
his b.s., trying to take them out of
Mine—Mill and leave them without pro-
tection, and he was sure that if a secret
ballot was taken the‘ vote would be to
stay in Mine-Mill. At this point, every-
body seemed to be hollering “secret

_ ballot.” Brother Becerra saw to. it that

the election was conducted honestly.
After counting of the ballots Board
Member Chavez removed the officers.

The local had an evening meeting-

the following, day which was ‘attended
by many who had missed ‘the Sunday
meeting. The vote was unanimous to
stay in Mine-Mill, and temporary of-
ficers were elected. ' . '

. VITAL ISSUES are now before Congress in the form of proposed
’ legislation dealing with ilabor,‘taxes, civil liberties, social security
and all the points raised inthe Mine-Mill jobs program.

Much of the legislation being pushed by the Eisenhower admini-
stration is a direct threat against free labor unions and their ability
to fight back against growing unemployment and developing depres_-
sion. Other bills introduced by forward-looking congressmen and
senators truly are in the interests of the people. What this session

 ‘ B     

There. has been a good deal of-talk in the Capi-2 >

tal on a National sales tax—or manufacturers excise
tax, the-same thing in disguise—. which would im-
pose. its heaviestburden on low income people.

On January. first, a 10% drop in personal in-
come taxes bec_am_e:effective.— To the average work-

ing man andwoman this will be but a drop-in-the ,

bucket, ifanything, since social security taxes went
up at the same time. However, for high income peo-
ple, this 10”/o'dr:op was a real windfall. V

This'iBillwould' permit working mothers and/or
parents to deduct the cost of child care expenses
incurred because of work. ‘ '

» Many of- the so—called “top-notch” economists
reporting for the Administration are suggesting re-
vamping the tax “structure for the benefit of cor-
porations and high income groups and not to. the
working men and women of the low income groups
where it is most‘ needed. '

It is expected that the Administration will make some sort of pro-
posal very soon in a Congressional message to replenish, the 8 billion dol-
lars lost by income tax reductions, both‘ personal and excess profits tax,
which died one-January first. 4 ' ‘ . -

At the moment, there seem to be no proposals or actio__n expected be-
fore the.rHouse Ways and Means Committee‘to' provide additional relief
on income taxes for low income people. ‘ "A I

There are several‘ Bills pending on this matter, and it is hoped some 

action will be forthcoming, since it is highly unfair for workingmothers
not to receive consideration for the extra expense of child care when

business men receive all sorts of deductions for entertainment, etc. in-

the course of their business. We should push for this legislation. 

Hearings areexpected before the House Ways & Means Committee I

on the entire tax picture in this coming session.

These bills would set up fair employment prac-
tices program. Purpose is to uncover discrimination
against Negro, Mexican-American, and other minor-'

ity groups in employment.

Ilelhman-Celler B111, revising and liberalizing the
anti-alien, anti-democratic present law, was intro-
duced into the last session of Congress.

irsoc|AL LEGliS

Introduced-by Senator Lehman of New York, this ’
bill extends and improves old age and survivors *'in“-'
surance now in effect. Amendment to the Lehman
Bill provides for far better improvements than the
President proposed in a special message.

Reed Bill returns unemployment compensation
funds to states,'except for $200,000,000 reserve fund;
would endanger‘ unemployment compensation pro-
gram. 4 ' ‘ i

This bill has passed the Senate. The House Judiciary Committee’ has I» ’

the bill before it. The Administration, through the Attorney General’s’ of-
fice, ispushing for this bill. Hundreds of outstanding legalf-igures‘have
come out against this legislation, as have leaders of church and labor
groups. . . 1. A '

No bills have yet been introduced. Some fight is expected in.’ the Sen-
_ate against additional ‘funds for McCarthy’s investigation. The Demo-

crats have indicated they will in some form make-an attempt to fight Mc-_ 
Carthy. Urge your Congressman and Senators to refuse to vote for ad-.*

ditional funds for these witch-hunt investigations.

As yet no concrete proposals have been forthcoming, although the‘ ‘ I

House Rules Committee did hold some hearings on this matter‘. ,

Original Senate hearings scheduled in 1953 were postponed; Senator

Ives announced hearings on thisimeasure the 'middle of January. We’

should demand a Committee‘ report for this legislation Withteethin it
for enforcement and urge oL1r Senators to vote this legislation, on’ the
floor. In the House, the Powell Bill, HR 170, which was to force the House
to vote on the issue, was pigeonholed in the last session.

The Administration was reported to have shelved this or similar re-"

emergency refugee legislation in 19,53.

Los incursionistas de Steel, el fiscal

los miembros del Local 509 que aban-
donaran a Mine-Mill a base del “Comu-

‘ isemana pasada,

intentaron asistir a la junta pero se
regresaron a sus casas cuando vieron
a la policia alrrededor de la entrada del
salon de la union, y otros mas que
entraron y no votaron por temer las
amenazas que se habian hecho.

Esta lucha no ha terminado. El re-
dactor del Herald Post, Ed Pooley, ha
dicho en un editorial en la primera
plana que continuara peleando contra

_ Mine-Mill y que no esté. hablando solo

de por si. .

Sabre proceso Jencks

El juicio estaba amontonado contra‘
nosotros desde el principio. Los miem-
bros del jurado todos eran comer-
ciantes; ni unc trabajador o ni un
mexico-americano. La prensa decla1'o
a Jencks culpable antes del proceso
judicial}.

El proceso duro diez dias, un testigo
tras otro fué probado como embus-
tero, pero el jurado estubo afuera solo
por veinté y dos minutos. Un caso de
tal importancia para el Compaﬁero
Jencks, para nuestra union,- para la
lucha por derechos civicos yr. contra el
histerismo, de cierto necesitaba mas
tiempo para recibaricualquier clase de

Estimados Compaﬁeras y Compaﬁeros:
Desde el fondo de mi corazon quiero

' darle las gracias a cada uno de ustedes,

a cada union local por su solidarida'd y
apoyo durante nuestra lucha mutua
contra este injusto ataque Taft-Hart-
ley. _
Fué un choque para mi ver la prose-
cusion atacar a nuestra union con" em-
‘ibusteiros probados -e informantes pro-
fesionales pagados. Me parecio .a mi,

1 y a otros observando en la corte, que

la prosecucion dio servicio a nuestra
Constitucion de los dientes para afuera,
pero en la especie de “evidencia” que
presento, acusaciones en vez de actos,
rompio apedazos el espiritﬁ de nuestro
'pais.’ -

El curso -del proceso me probo lo
que muchos de ustedes me han dicho
en recientes meses pasados, que
‘este ataque tiene como su principal

,jblanco'.a nuestra union, nuestras gan-
f ancias de salarios, nuestras condiciones
de trabajo. ’ -

Me fortalecio y me animo mucho el

 que muchos de ustedes compaﬁeras y

' compaﬁeros permanecieranen el salon
- de corteﬂdurante el -juicio, y que "no se
' dejaran amedrantar por los espantosos ‘
' encabezados de la prensa dia tras dia.

f El hecho de que no pudieranencontrar

; - nada me hinchio de -orgullo.

- alguien de mi local quetestificase con-

tra mi -0 contra Mine-Mill mas que

Pronto recibiran un informe mas

 complete del juicio y la clase detes-

.-gtigos‘, utilizados _por el .gobier'no' para
Agtratar jde desacreditar los, avances que :'

Mine-Mill haihecho. Por favor traten
de leerlo en _nuestro ' periodico “The
Union,” y si tienen preguntas o suger-
encias sobre como ganar el caso, seran
bien recibidas. , ' ' '
7 Les Tprometo mi devocion continua

1 a. los miembros de nuestragran _union.

Trabajando juntos -derrotaremos no
solo este ataque contra nuestra ‘union,
pero también continuaremos en el
sendero de ganar mas para nuestras

Millard is too busy raiding, - 
. can’: botherwith organizing

VANCOUVER, B.C.—While Steel has
been busy raiding Mine-Mill and other

_ jurisdictions, its largest local in British

Columbia has been snipped off by the

AFL Machinists. I
[The IAM has taken over certifica-

tion for the Vancouver Iron Works,

on a Labor Relations Board vote.

The Iron Works has been under

»- Steel for quite some time, but the com-

pany recently amalgamated with the
Vancouver Engineering Works, where

U the IAM took over jurisdiction from I

Steel when that union’s members be-

 came disgusted with the Steel raidon

Trail. In the vote for overall certifi-

_l cation of the two plants, Steel lost by
‘* 135 to 106 votes, and is now appealing. _ v

Including the loss of V.E.W. three
years ago, this makes the third Van-
couver plant Steel has had. taken over
by the AFL since Millard started his

' raiding spree.

Steel has a full force of organizers

out here, but whatever they are doing‘, ,_

they are not organizing.,One peculiar
thing about, the raids they have suf-
fered, is that nobody seems very much
put out about it, even their own mem-

“ bership, labor generally, taking the
‘*view' that they have asked for all they

get. i , . I. . , .
Also, Steel itself has made no pro-
test in the bodies controlled, by the

Canadian Congress of Labor,’even the '

brazen henchmen of ‘Charlie Millard
apparently lacking the brass-bound

nerve to put upa howl at actionswhich ;
have become a matter“ of- policy with

their own union. . _ , 2 .
