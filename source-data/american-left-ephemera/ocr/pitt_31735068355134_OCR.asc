International Union's 70th Convention
Sets Goals and Policy for Two Years

DENVER—In a busy and productive 70th Anniversary Convention, some two hundred delegates of the Interna-
tional Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers worked out contract policy for next year, took strong positions on civil
liberties, civil rights, safety and health, unemployment, peace, defense of the Union, relations with other unions and many
other subjects. Officers were nominated to serve for the next two years under the new district and officer structure

. Mine -Mill Conventio

adopted in last year's referendum.

The delegates gave standing ovations to addresses by Rev. Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and Presidents James Hoffa of the Teamsters Union and Albert Fitzgerald of UE. They were impressed by

the address of Marling J. Ankeny, director of the U. S.
Bureau of Mines. Many took part in a Safety Panel led
by J. Howard Bird of the Bureau of Mines.

The position of Honorary President was created for
President John Clark, who announced his retirement to
the Convention.

As always at Mine-Mill Conventions, the floor was
wide open for discussion by every delegate who wanted to
take part———and many did. Most of the attention of the
Convention was upon the urgent problems of working
people. Resolutions adopted are fully reported in this
issue of The Mine-Mill Union.

No changes in the International Constitution were
recommended by the Convention.

. Next Mine-Mill Convention will be held in Denver in
March, 1965.

‘We Have Learnecllliitliiemlii-lard Way‘

Eaccerpts From Resolution on Civil Liberties

In the 70 years of our existence as a Union, we
have had to learn the hard way the importance of
our nation's Constitution and its Bill of Rights. Our
members and leaders have fought for the right to
organize, strike, and picket. We have been involved
in a hundred court fights in which we have won the ‘
right to live as a union. '

‘A'**

We call upon all Americans, and especially the
American labor movement, to use their strength and
energy for the extension of free institutions, to fight
those who seek to deny, rather than to extend, in-
dividual liberty, and to join with us to preserve our
tradition of due process, free belief, free expression,
and equality. -

World Peace,
0 I O
Minority Rights

DENVER, Colo.-—Two
consecutive resolutions
passed by the 70th Anni-
versary convention reflect-
ed the delegates’ concern
with the major problems
confronting the nation as a
whole—the question of a
peaceful world and equality
for this country’s minority
peoples.

In order to combat the drain
on the nation’s financial and
human resources created by the
armament program, in which
“70 per cent of our tax dollar
goes to pay for past, present,
and future wars,” Mine-Mill
called for a change over to an
economy of peaceful production,
noting that the higher Wages
and better pensions which the
union works for would be use-
less “if we were not here to en-
joy them.”

Expanded world trade, and a
public works program devoted
to the building of more schools,
homes, hospitals, roads and li-
braries was the direction in
which such a peaceful economy
should develop, the resolution
the
statement that basic to its pro-
gram was an international

agreement for c 0 m pl e t e dis-y

armament.

The resolution on civil rights
declared it was “to the eternal
shame of America that the Ne-
gro people, American Indians,
Puerto Ricans, Mexican-Ameri
cans and other minorities still
had to fight for first class citi-
zenship.”

Hoffa at Mine-Mill Convention Calls
For Renewed Labor Unity, Militancy

DENVER——Teamster President James R. Hoffa
called for labor unity and a march on Washington in an
address toMine-Mill’s 70th Anniversary Convention.-

Hoffa, head of the million-member International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, expressed the strongest soli-
darity with the goals of Mine-Mill and told President John
Clark, “I know from personal experience the cost in time,
money, health and the human spirit your union has paid
for the many court victories you have won against .tli_e

false charges of conspiracy.”

Hoffa then warned the convention that “we are liv-
ing in a police state.” He cited as evidence of hisvcharge

the newanti-labor legislation pending in Congress and the _.

creation within the office of
United States Attorney-General

. Robert Kennedy of an extensive

organization devoted exclusively
to the continued harassment of
labor.

Bills singled out by Mr. Hoffa
were: the proposals of Senator
Goldwater of Arizona for a na-
tional “right-to-work” law, Ar.-
kansas Senator McClellan’s bill
to place unions in the trans-
portation industry under the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and
Representative Martin of Ne-
braska’s bill which would out-
law industry-wide bargaining.

Hits NLRB Ruling

Hoffa reserved his strongest
opinions for the decision of the
National Labor Relations Board
interpreting the Landrum-Grif-
fin Act as it applied to picket
lines. “Under this unanimous
ruling,” said Hoffa, “it would
be illegal for us to honor any
picket line except those set up
against our own employers;
would make illegal any picket
line not voted by the majority of
all workers involved in a struck

- plant; and forbid a longglist of

picket lines set up for other
causes, such as scabproducts,
which have ‘been recognized as
legitimate by the courts up till
this time.”

“This decision of the Labor
Relations Board proves my
charge made in 1958 to the then
Senator John: Kennedy, that the
Landrum-Griff-in Act would BY
LAW make scabs out of every
union man in the country,” he

John Clark to Retire; Convention
N ames” Him M-‘M Honorary President

DENVER——After 55 years in the labor movement, Mine-Mill president John
Clark has announced his retirement, effective June 30.
In appreciation of his long service to the union, delegates to the 70th anniversary
convention made him honorary president, noting. that during Mr. Clark’s term of office
the union had made the most substantial gains in its history. Wages alone have in-
creased by $1.5O an hour for workers in the non-ferrous mining industry during the

past 15 years.

. Born in Sheffield, England, in 1888, Clark joined the old Western Federation of
Miners in Phoenix, British Columbia in_1908. “I was inducted into the union under

the "forest trees by candlelight,”
he recalls, ‘_‘because it wa s
worth your life in those days to
be known as ,a union man.” The
man who broke him in on the
machines underground was a
blacklisted associate of Bill Hay-
wood and Charles Moyer in the
days when thousands of miners
were ‘rounded up by Federal
troops and placed in stockades

during the early struggles of

the Federation.

Drove Stagecoach

When not working in the
mines, Clark drove a four-
horse stage between Phoenix
and Greenwood, and later ran
a. small ranch in the state of
Washington. In the ’ 1920s, Clark

.worked in the zinc refinery at

Great Falls, Montana, and dur-
ing the Great Depression panned

_for_gold in Confederate Gulch.

. In Great Falls,-he joined Local
16, today the oldest local in

terms of continuous activity in .

the Mine-Mill union. Clark be-

came a’ United States citizen
in 1936, held many offices in the
local, andin 1948 was elected

l

 

president of the international.
He was a member of the execu-
tive board of the CIO, and was
a close associate of John L.
Lewis and Phillip Murray.

Difficult Times

It was during Clark’s term of
office as president that Mine-
Mill underwent severe attacks
from the government, with pros-
ecutions under the Taft-Hartley
act and hearings before the Sub-
versive Activities Control
Board, which is attempting to
have the union declared “Com-
munist-infiltrated.” During this
time, national and local unions
representing over 5 million or-
ganized: workers have gone on
record in support of Mine-Mill.

‘After thanking the delegates
for making him their honorary
president, Clark said, ‘-‘lljhope
you will find some union jobs
for me to do in the years ahead.
I will find our apartment a lot
more confining than any min
I’ve ever worked in.” , n 8'

concluded.
here today.”

‘Tired M.en""
Hoffa also attacked “those
poor, tired men” who lead the

AFL-CIO for their do-nothing
policies which contribute to the

“I repeat that charge

present poor condition of organ-‘

ized labor, and struck out at the

continued suppression of free-

dom of speech onthe subject of
labor’s interests. He cited pro-
posed legislation which. would
enable radio and TV stations to
refuse to grant equal time to

all candidates: in an election. 1 8

Opposed to the massive anti-
labor forces within -and without
government, said Hoffa, are
such unions as Mine.-Mill, the
International Longshoremen and
Warehousemen’s Union,‘ United
Electrical Workers, Teamsters,

and certain other independent "

unions. “On these unions rests
the hope of the American labor
movement” he concluded. It
was then that he made his plea
for labor to make its presence
felt directly in Washington,
with union members coming
from all over America “six to a
car.” - 4

Clark Thanks Hoffa.‘ I

If"noth_ing is done to prevent
the continued harassmentlof un-
ions, Hoffa declared, American
labor would one day face’ the
situation of the French workers
today, where 300,000 have been
forced to the most extreme
forms of demonstration in order

to protest arbitrary government A
control of their livelihoods and ,

the well-beingof their families.
There are today in this country
30 million families with incomes
of $3000 a year for less, he
pointed out. .
In ‘ introducing Hoffa, Mine-
Mill President John Clark ex-
pressed the‘ union’s profound
thanks for the moral and fi-

nancial assistance of the Team- *

sters during the 1959 copper
strike. At the conclusion of the
hour-long address, the conven-
tion went on record as unani-
mously calling for an end to the

government’s persecution and-

harrassment of Hoffa.

All Skinner

_ Candidate for President

For the first time since 1947

» our Union‘ will elect a new

president next month. Until

' Brother Clark announced his in-

tention to retire, I withheld my
own declaration. As a candi-
date for president I have a
number of things to say regard-
ing the responsibility of this
job.

’ 1. I have no intention of seek-
ing the highest office in Mine-
Mill to’ preside over the dis-

solution of this Union.

2. Should I be elected I will
use all my energy and effort

». toward building and extending

the influence of Mine-Mill as
the major Union in the non-fer-
industry in the
United States and Canada.

'0 3. During the past year we
have had considerable debate,
speculation and discussion about
“where Mine-Mill was going.”
Such discussion should be ended
now——beca-use three important

events have taken place in our

Union within the past year that
have determined “where Mine-
Mill is going”—they are:

Joint meetings with the Cana-
dian Executive Board which

-resulted in rejecting “merger”
. as any answer to our member-

ship in United States and

Canada.

The Membership Referendum
last October which overwhelm-
ingly supported proposals for
increased income to operate the
Union, building a big Interna-
tional strike fund and reorgan-
ization of the administration of
the Union.

The Convention last month
which developed a program and
charted a course on Labor
Unity, Collective Bargaining,
Defeat of Raids, Political Ac-
tion, Civil Rights activity and
Defense of the Union.

These three developments put
an end to “merger” specula-
tion and said in effect—We
know where we are going—so
let’s get on with it! V . ,

The men elected to lead our
;Union will be responsible to
“get on with the job.” In my
humble opinion, this means a
leadership with determination,

V L confidence and a fair share of

“guts” to deliver for our mem-
bership.

If you believe that my 25-year
record in this union warrants

a my election_ to the presidency,

I will appreciate your support-
—because I want to be part of
the team and “get on with the
job.”

Shelter Program

A noted Psychiatrist, Dr.
Frank Caprio, says people liv-
-ing in fallout shelters would
have a bigger problem than
boredom: sex. Danger heightens
the mating urge and the kind of
danger driving people into shel-

.ters would increase the libido
. 3-ufeven more, he says. The good
. .~.-doctor suggested that the only
 ”3'solution-.. would be to build par-
*titi0.!iS.-'  ' ‘ 

  
  

 

  

J. P. Mooney

Candidate for President

What I have to say to the
membership as a candidate for
President of A the International
Union of vMine, Mill and Smelter
Workers is involved around the
important question of this Un-
ion’s STRUGGLE FOR EXIST-
ENCE.

This Union of ours has a long
rich 70-year history of STRUG-
GLE FOR EXISTENCE., Today
as members of Mine-Mill we
find ourselves up against the
toughest "struggle this Union has
faced in 40 years. All kinds of
forces are at work in an effort
to destroy this Union and the
democratic principals -for which
it stands. We must not allow
these forces, or people, to suc-
ceed. This is very important to
the workers in our Industry. We
must bewilling to make _what-
ever sacrificesand in whatever
formsinecessary to insure our
Union’s success in its STRUG-
GLE FOR EXISTENCE.

This Union must direct all of
its attention to the job for which
it was organized, that is: To
unite the persons working under
its jurisdiction into one central
body. To improve general con-
ditions by increasing wages, and
shortening hours of labor. To re-
move or prevent dangers inci-

5 dent to our work. To eliminate

the dust, smoke, gases and poi-
sonous fumes from our working
places. To work for the enact-
ment and enforcement of legis-
lation that will protect the lives,
limbs and health of the workers
and to improve the social condi-
tions of the workers and their

families. To promote political‘

action consistant with democrat-
ic principals. In order to do
these things our Union must in-
volve the younger workers em-
ployed under its jurisdiction.
This Union must involve the
wives and other women folks of

r Mine-Mill families. These young-

er workers and the women folks
can be a real asset to this Union
in- its STRUGGLE FOR EX-
ISTENCE. _

As I stated at the Convention;
This union must go on the offen-
sive. This Union must _move
ahead. This Union must go out

— and organize the new properties

coming under its jurisdiction.
This Union must get itself in a
position to be able to bring back
those locals which have been
lost by raids and secession. We
must rebuild this Union. Our
struggle for existance depends
on our ability, as a Union, to do
these things.

The objectives outlined above
can be had, provided however,
we have a united leadership and
a united and determined mem-
bership of this Union. Our atten-
tion in this campaign must be
focused on coming out of this
election of Officers and mem-
bers of the Executive Board
with such a united leadership
and membership-

As for many local union offi-
cers and rank-and-file members

.I don’t have to say -anything, be-
 c-au_se'“ _y_-ou- know',.wh_ere'  stand. I ~

Asbury Howard
- Vice-‘President '

As a candidate for Vice-Presi-
dent, I wish to thank the dele-
gates for the nomination and the
many seconds from every sec-
tion of the union including Can-
ada.

I wish to thank you for the
confidence you placed in me as
your Eastern Vice-President, a

position you have electedf me‘ to”

since 1953. -

Now I ask you to elect me as
Vice-President of this great
Union. When elected I pledge to
give the’ kind of leadership that
is expected or required of a
Vice-President. I accept allvthe
responsibilities that go with the
office.

I further pledge to support the
program adopted by the 58th
Convention‘ 100% and work to
build a stronger Mine-Mill Un-
ion. I hope and pray that the
membership of this Union will
continue their support for the
defense of the Union and those
brothers who are being perse-
cuted for their fight for the bet-

terment of the workers and their

families and ‘the hard unyield-
ing fight against the bosses.

We will strengthen our Union
if we fight hard for complete
acquittal and vindication of all
the defendants in the so-called
conspiracy case. Brothers Mar-
cotti, Durkin, Powers, and my-
self have been acquitted. I hon-
estly feel the others will be ac-
quitted, also——“Where there is
no struggle, there is no prog-
ressf’

I endorse Western Vice-Presi-
dent Albert Skinner for Presi-
dent, a vacancy created by the
retirement of our honored and
beloved President John Clark. I
know Brother Skinner is well
qualified for the job. His quali-
fications have been proven
through his long years of experi-
ence and tough negotiations with
the major companies in the in-
dustry.

The‘ members will express
themselves at the polls, May 21,
1963. I shall be happy to work
harmoniously with the choice of
the membership.

Pedestrians

Pedestrians c r o s si n g the
street didn't make it on more
than 170,000 occasions during
1960. Dead after being struck
down by a car were more than
5,000 persons while more than
165,000 were injured.

  

However, for the benefit of those
who do not know me, I wish to
say to you that should I be elect-
ed President of our Internation-
al Union then I shall do every-
thing in my power to see that
all the time, effort and monies
of your International Union is
spent in bringing about these
objectives. With your help and
Gods guidance our Union will
succ'eed,in its STRUGGLE FOR
EXISTENCE.

- . Regardless -offwho you decide

tto,:v.ote' for . . . be sure and vote.

   

 

James OW. Buck

Candidate for
Vice-President

Greetings to all members of

' the International Union of Mine, ‘

Mill and Smelter Workers of the
United States and Canada.

"I" am a candidate for Vice
Presidentbecause I believe this
Union needs a full-time Vice

~ President. We need a Vice Pres- ’

ident who will give service and

. personal attention to the prob-

lems of this Union. I firmly be-

lieve we must have a united‘
leadership representative of all

sections of the Union and re-
flecting the varying interests
and viewpoints of our member-
ship. Mine, Mill needs full" time,
dedicated, capable leadership to
win against the attacks we face.

IF ELECTED, I WILL:

1. Be a full-time Vice Presi-
dent.

2. Give full-time service to the
International and its local
unions.

3. Give full-time attention to
the needs of the member-
ship and the strengthening
of contracts and organiza-
tion. .

4. Efficient operation of the
international office and im-
proved service to all local
unions, both in the U.S. and
Canada. -

5. Keep all the membership,
wherever located, fully in-
formed on all matters at
all times. i

As a candidate for the office
of Vice President, I wish the
membership to know that I have
a long record of service and ac-
tivity in Mine, Mill, beginning
as a member of Local 51, Selby,
California, in 1948. I have been
trustee, vice president, and
president of Local 51; served as
secretary and later as president
of the AS&R Bargaining Coun-
cil, and have been International
Executive Board’ member from-
District 7 for the past two years.
I have personally assisted in ne-
gotiating contracts with the
American Smelting and Refining
Company, Phelps Dodge, Stanf-
fer Chemical Co., Mountain Cop-
per, American Zinc, Trojan
Powder C o m p a n y, Flintkote
Company, Del Monte Properties,
Revere Copper and Brass, Amer-
ican Brake Shoe’, Adams Camp-
bell C0,, Great Western Cord-
age, Magnus Metal, and H.
Kramer Company.

If I am elected Vice Presi-
dent of this International Union,
I do not intend to become either
a rubber stamp or an absentee
officer. I intend to be active in
negotiations of contracts affect-
ing the welfare of our member-
ship. 0 P ‘

If you are ready for  full
time Vice President both in the
United. States and. Canada, then

" I askjfor your vote and support. .

~ Secretary-Treasurer‘

I am seeking re-election-uas,

Secretary-Treasurer of the In- 
ternational Union'on*the,'.basis 
of my record in ‘office. " ‘-
The first responsibility of the ‘_ - ‘
"Secretary-Treasurer is to se-* 

cure the financial well being -of

the Union. Within the past-3two'v
years»-we-met our financial obli- ‘ ’
gations because we practiced -

the most stringent economies.

We must continue to do so. But i

we must do morethan that.

I

Now that we have additional”

income as a result of the per
capita increase we must budget

our needs. Budgeting is a form
of financial planning. Without
planning it will be difficult to set

money aside for a reserve, for ,

proper servicing ofcour mem-'

bership, or for organizational 3

work.

The Secretary-Treasurer’s job
has always involved‘ more than
financial responsibility. Key to
the continued well being of our
Union will be our ability to
turn the tide organizationally.
Before many months have
passed we will be in a cam-
paign in the Coeur d’Alenes to

win back Bunker Hill. We have

to throw all available resources
into that campaign.

We must begin preparations
now for our 1964 collective bar-
gaining program. The key. slo-

gan for ’64 is job security. The

Convention developed‘ a pro-
gram around which we can
rally our membership, the com-
munities we live in, and the
other unions throughout our in-
dustry, Our International Ex-
ecutive Board has again and
again called upon all the unions
in the industry to unite on a
common collective bargaining

program. I am under no illu--

sions that Steel will join such a ’

move. But other unions will, and
there are many of them in our
industry. We must begin this
job now. , ' '

We have one prime legisla-
tive objective in the next year—
the introduction and passage of a
Federal Mine Safety Act for our
industry. This law is long over-
due. Every mining company in
the country will be fighting the
passage of an effective Federal
Mine Safety Act. We have the
responsibility of developing the
kind of support for this legisla-
tion that will guarantee its pas-
sage. _

This coming year will be a
busy and rough one. It therefore
becomes a necessity that we
b r i d g e whatever differences
may arise among us during
the election c a m p a i g n. We
have enormous responsibilities
to our membership‘ and all the
workers in»'the"indus_t1ry,._ The ex-
tent. to whichwe remain_ a unit-
ed fighting organization will be

the extent to which we will be

able _to fulfill.‘ these responsibili- -  _

  Frank Vettoel

Candidate for '
Secretary-Treasurer

My being a first time candi-
date for International Office, I
should first tell the membership
that I became a member of
Mine Mill Hegeler Zinc Local
209 in February of 1937 before
I became 18 years of age. I am
a Miner’s son and my family

; has been part of the -Western _
-, Federation, of‘ Miners, founders ‘

of Mine-Mill.‘ . ‘ .

I served as President of Local
209 and held other offices in the
Local. I served in World War 2
and was assigned to the Staff in
1947, working in several Dis-
tricts of this International Union.

I am now in the Southwest,
particularly Arizona of District
2, serving as Regional Director.
In almost all organizational

‘ campaigns or combatting raid-

ers, I have been placed “in
charge” by the International

‘Board Member‘ which certainly

gives credence to my ability and

i devotion to this Union.

I have intimate experience
with all sections of our industry
and our Union, whether it be in

. mining, milling, smelting or fab-

ricating.
I ‘am a candidate for Interna-

‘ tional Union Secretary-Treasur-
er; »because. this International-

‘Union must continue as a lead-
ingforce in the American Trade
Union movement. The future of
Unions in America depends on
Unions like ‘ours. The future will
bring more struggles around the
needs of our members such as
fight for Civil

Defense of our Union while we
continue to seek a Peaceful
World and search for Labor to
unite. '

This coming period won’t be
easy. With only three Interna-
tional Officers, we need more
cooperation and teamwork. I
support Al Skinner for Interna-
tional President and Asbury
Howard for International Vice
President.

I assure the members of this

" International Union when elect-

ed, you will see Officers “in the

' field” to carry out the Conven-

tion program and efficient oper-
ations in the International Office
and better services to our Local
Unions.

Bernard Rask
Board. Member. District 1

I deeply appreciate the honor
of having been nominated to the
office of Board Member from
the new District 1.

I will endeavor to do my best
for the membership in the new
District and the entire Union.
In order to do this I will need
and seek the cooperation and

‘assistance of all the member-

ship, ‘Local, Union leaders, and
the International leadership.

Since the passage of the refer-
endum I have made it my busi-
ness to become acquainted with
the problems of the workers in
the Coeur d’Alenes. The Mon-
tana membership feel a very
close tie to the Coeur d’Alenes.
They know what happens .at
Bunker and at Page and Galena
deeply affects their interests.
They are prepared to give every
assistance in the fight to win
back Bunker Hill.

In Montana we have main-
tained a Local Union at Ana-
conda which operates out of its
own headquarters. We know
how deeply the workers at
Anaconda are dissatisfied with
Steel. We intend to get that
Local back and once again re-
unify the workers in Montana
in the International Union of
Mine, Mill and Smelter Work-

,BI‘S.

The Anaconda Company is
moving its Concentrator from
Anaconda to Butte. We ‘have
served notice on the company
that every worker in Butte is
covered by the jurisdiction of
Local 1. Under no circum-
stances will the Butte miners
permit any other Union to move
into Butte whether it be with
the Concentrator or in any other
fashion.

In Montana our Union is the
most important part of the la-
bor movement. We are rec-
ognized on every level from the
bargaining table’ to the national
capital. I am sure this holds
true in the entire new District,
from Tacoma to Great Falls.

The office of Board Member
for -District 1 will not be an
easy job. We in District 1 face
the same problems that our
Union and all the labor move-
ment faces, and we must all
work together to help solve
these problems.

I believe my experience as a
miner, President of Butte Lo-
cal No. 1, and as Executive
Board Member qualifies me for
this position.

I hope that under my leader-
ship District 1 will continue to
play a leading role within the
labor movement, the commu-
nity, and within the Interna-
tional Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers.

School Bus Riders

Nearly 34 percent of the

Raymond E.

Graham

Candidate for
Board Member, District 1

To my fellow workers in the
Mines, Mills and Smelters of
Washington; Idaho and Montana:

I seek the office of Board
Member for our new district No.
1, and the privilege of working
with and for you in that capaci-
ty. .

My experience in Union work
ranges from steward to business
agent. and in one capacity or
another has been life long. In
the last 17 years, as a member
of Mine-Mill Local 16, at Great
Falls, I have been elected to al-
most every negotiating commit-
tee and to 12 Mine-Mill conven-
tions.

Parallelling my concern and
work on the problems of wages,
working conditions. and griev-
ances, I spent literally thou-
sands of hours and days on leg-
islative activities and organiza-
tions from precinct work and
registration to lobbying at the
capitol.

If I am elected, I shall devote
my energies not only in the
struggle around bargaining, but
to encourage the organization of
our people in legislative and po-
litical activity, since both areas
are equally important to the de-
fense and improvement of our
living standards.

I am pledged also to the over- M

riding proposition of organizing
and unifying the workers in our
industry which must be done to‘
further enhance .our position on
the bargaining and legislative
fronts.

We must give leadership to
the desire of and make possible
the return of many of our for-
mer members. -

I believe that thousands of th
unorganized, misorganized, and
disorganized workers in our in-
dustry, want and need the demo-
cratic machinery of Mine-Mill
to fight their battles as opposed
to theautocratic and dictatorial
national unions that now hold
them captive.

I am a candidate because I
think that I can bring a fresh
View point to our executive
board and that I have the ability
and understanding to work with
you and for you in an effort to
improve the lot and position of
our membership. "

The Bare Facts

SAN FRANCISCO—The Na-
tional Labor Relations Board
had a real poser before it as
to whether a machine shop
was within its rights in firing
a man because a brightly
colored nude tattooed on his
his arm. The company in fir.-
ing him said that the tattoo
might embarrass female em-
ployees.

Settlement of the firing was
finally covered up when the

company agreed they would

re-hire the machinist if he
t a t to 0 e cl a “brassiere and
panties” on the nude figure.

Wilam E. Lee

Candidate for
Board_ Member, District 1

Some of the prerequisites of
being a candidate for Executive
Board Member are the qualifi-
cations and ability to organize
and promote the type of pro-
grams that will work to the ad-
vantage and benefit of every
brother in the district and the
International Union, in the fields
of:

1. Negotiations, both local and
national.

2. The every day problems of
locals on grievances and ar-
bitrations.

3. Preparation and presentation
of programs to State Legisla-

. tures and Congress.

41. Political activity is a must,
we must take an active part
in the election of friends of
labor to State legislatures and
Congress. A

5. Organizing the unorganized
workers is an area that has
lain dormant too long. There
are thousands of potential
Mine Mill members in Dis-
trict I if a well organized
campaign is launchedto ob-
tain their bargaining rights.
After much deliberation and

careful consideration I firmly
believe I have the qualifications
and ability to successfully per-
form the duties, responsibilities
and obligations of Board Mem-
ber of District One.

I have been the full time Busi-
ness Agent of Tacoma Smelter-
men’s Union for six years.

I have been a member of the

AS&R Council for eight years. .

and a member of the national
negotiating committee six years.

I have been a labor lobbyist
the past three sessions of the
legislature, being appointed to
the Steering Committee of the
Labor Lobby the past‘ two ses-
sions.

I have represented my local
in Washington D.C. before com-
mittees and Senators and Con-
gressmen on the unfair compe-
tition of the Japanese Copper
industry.

I am not an individualist nor
a factionist. I believe all men
are created equal and should be
afforded equal opportunities re-
gardless of religion, nationality,
color of skin or political belief.

No matter who is elected I
will work with the officers of
this International Union to the
best of my ability.

Ladies’ Room ‘Bug’

PROVIDENCE, R. I. — A
new election was ordered by the
NLRB at the Glass-Tite Indus-
tries plant here because, among
other things, the ladies’ room
had been “bugged.” Although
the company denied responsi-
bility for a microphone found by
three IUE supporters around
some ceiling beams in the
women’s restroom before the
vote, the NLRB examiner was
convinced the “mike” was in-
stalled to overhear talk about
the union and that the company
was responsible.

 

Luther 
Church

Candidate for
Board Member. District 1

I wish to express my deep ap-
preciation to the Delegates of
District 1 for placing my name
in nomination for Board Mem-
ber of District No. 1.

I support the program adopted 5

by the 58th Convention 100 per
cent and will work with whom-
ever is elected to office by the
membership to carry out this
program.

I am a firm believer in Labor
Unity and I would work toward
uniting all workers to the sup-
port of programs beneficial to
the welfare of our membership.

If it was possible at this time,
I would favor an honorable pact
or affiliation with an honest,
trade union; however, I feel

Mine Mill must continue to .re-'

tain its proud identity, its bar-
gaining councils and its histori-
cal democratic principles and
procedure. Our members must
retain their right to select their
officers and executive board
members; and their rightito
make decisions on programs or

policies affecting their_Union or , I

the memberships welfare.

A few words about myself: I
am 48 years old, married, and
have four children going to

school. I was born in Magna,"  In

Utah and raised in Colorado
where I completed my High
School education. I joined Mine
Mill Local. 233 McGill, Nevada
in 1936 while working‘ for the

Nevada Consolidated C o p p e r I ‘

Company. In 19411 ‘came to the

»

Coeur d’ Alenes and of course ’

immediately reinstated myself
in Local 18. I became a shop
steward in 1945, Vice President

in 1952 and full time Financial .

Secretary of Local 18 in 1956
and have held this position with-
out opposition ever since.

I hope, as in the past, those
who are elected to the responsi-

ble positions as Officers of this ,

International will work together

for its welfare and that of the '

membership—to this I pledge
myself. ’

Again may I thank those dele-
gates for the honor they have
given me.

Being nominated by an over-

To" put_oneself.forward as a

Jae Dispense
_ Candidate for
Board Member. District 3

My decision to be a candi-
date for Board Member of Dis-
trict 3 is the result of a lot of
study and consultationby sev-
eral delegates from District 3
who had attended the conven-

’ tion. It was apparent to many

of. us that not only was it an
--election to determine‘ who would
-beco1"n'e President of the Union,
but it had become a question of

‘ what is good -for the rank and

file members or are the ambi-

tions of some people more im-
‘portant. We had to reach the
‘--conclusion that the welfare of

the rank and file ’must come‘
«above all and we could no
longer ‘sit by "and let it be said

: that we no longer have any prob-

-lems in the union since the per
capita increase and that every-
thing was goiiﬁ along 'very

smooth; This is far’ from being '
--irigl1’t‘.a‘nd .I would like to state’
' my reasons for'.not.bei_n'g able to
"agree with the "opponents" of ‘
Brother Mooney and myself as‘

candidates for office.

-1. Insthc past 21/2 years we
havelost, through raids on our
union, about 25,000 members

‘ in the *United States and Can- .
. ada. ~  ‘ -

. 2. At a recent executive board

ditional I_nternat_ional,. Repre-
sentatives would have to be laid

, off.

3. I don’t believe that it has
‘to become necessary to try and

create asplit in the union by ac-
cusing officers who are seeking
re-election of - being agents -of
some ; other’ union, because his
idea ofiwhat is best for «therank
and file “member is {different
than thatof some other office

or‘ his supporter.

The contest for office has he'- _

come acontest whiclr involves
two basic differences and I be-
came a candidate for board
member of District '3 so "that "I

~ would support the position that

the welfare of the rank and file

can be achieved ;by-‘Acrejating bf
unity on the ‘executive board‘

and not disunity. _ : ;_

Negro Income-Gain
Outpaced by White

While Negroes have_ made

economic progress in recent

years, it's not as much as com-
monly supposed, according to

.Executive Secretary Lester B.

Granger of the National Urban
League. Pointing out that in-
come of white families is ris-
ing faster than that of Negro
families, Granger cited Census
Bureau figures showing that

i . between 1950 and 1958 the

average income of white, fam-
ilies‘ increased 54 per cent
(from $3,445 to $5,300) while
that of Negro families -rose
45 per cent (from $1,869 to
$2,711).

Brother Anderson demonstrated

in a positive way’ his support

for the principle of representa-

the Union.
As a membervof Mine-Mill, I

- was proud to read the message.
of Pope John XXIII. Anyone: -

reading that message and who

also reads the program of Mine- - -

find that His ‘Eminence in his} -
- _ Encyclical ‘;‘Pacem, in Terris”

presents a program to the world
that‘ almost exactly says what

Mine-Mill has said over the 4,
, years.

} It is precisely because our"

Union down through the years

. has been a crusading organiz~a- 
etion fighting to advance the so-

cial, economic and political wel-

fare of its members that it and ‘ or
its leaders have been subjected.
to all kinds of harassment ‘and;---I "

are some in the Union who n1is- ,.

takenly believe that we can es-

secution by burying ourselves -» .

I stand with the men in our

the courage, and the guts to

stand for our Union’s traditions,

its tested wisdom, and its pro-‘

Independents Not Isolated  

Says UE President Fitzgerald

DENVER—The independent unions are no longer isolated from the mainstream
of American labor, said Albert J. Fitzgerald, president of the United Electrical and
Radio Workers at the Mine-Mill Convention.

In defense of his ‘contention, Fitzgerald‘ cited the solidarity with Mine-Mill ex-
pressed by the national conventions of such unions as the AmalgamatedMeat Cutters

and Butcher Workmen, United
Auto Workers, United Packing-
house Workers, and the appear-
ance at Mine-Mill’s convention
of Teamsters president James
Hoffa. _

Fitzgerald called for con-
tinued and increasing militant
action on the part of all unions
as the only correct course for
the future of the American la-
bor movement.

UE Record

Fitzgerald listed 16 UE bar-
gaining certifications in Canada
in the last three months, 7
NLRB certifications and four
election victories in New York
since the beginning of the year,
as proof that the rank-and—file
of the workers in the electrical
industry support UE’s cam-
paign for improved wages and
working conditions. UE is pro-
ceeding with organizing cam-
paigns in California,’ Indiana,

Albert Fitzgerald

New York and Illinois which
Fitzgerald expects will continue
the successes already recorded.

Referring to a resolution
passed by the convention in
support of the Mine-Mill De-
fense fund, Fitzgerald said, “In
our union we call it our fighting
fund, because in UE we believe
in opposing these attacks we are
fighting for the future of the
entire labor movement.”

Support Equal Rights‘
In urging an expanded pro-
gram of support in Washington
for legislation favorable to la-

bor, Fitzgerald warned that the

unions must also undertake the
responsibility of supporting de-
mands of the Negro people for
equal rights. “They are not
satisfied with getting a few stu-
dents into a few Southern col-
leges,” Fitzgerald said. “If we

don't move in their direction, __

the Negro people will not sup-
port our demands.” 1

Won at SanManuel

SAN MANUEL, Ariz.——The Union has won an im-

portant- arbitration decision

against the San Manuel

Copper Co., a division of Magma Copper. The decision
strikes down the company’s use of charges of “excessive
absenteeism’-’ to deny seniority rights inbid jobs.

George Chacon, a member of Mine-Mill Magma
Copper Local 937, was awarded a previously denied
promotion, with back pay, by the March 29 decision of
.Arbitrator Leo Kotin of Los Angeles.

Chacon’s grievance arose from his disqualification
for.promotion to raise blaster as a result of “excessive

absenteeism.” “Of Chacon’s 27
absences in a nine-month pe-
riod,‘14 were excused absences
resulting from his duties as ‘a
union representative.

Kotin ruled that such excused
absences, specifically provided
for in the contract, could not be
counted with other absences in
determining “excessive absen-
teeism.”

10°/o Allowed

The company’s cut-off point
for absenteeism is 10~=-per cent,
above which they will refuse
promotion. Discounting Chacon’s
‘absences on union business, his
record for the period was 7.4
per cent. ,

, Kotin ruled that “the company
has contractually agreed to per-
mit a certain type of absence
and then has relied on such ab-
sence as~a basis for denying a
right which the employe might
otherwise have claimed. This
situation, in the opinion of this
"Arbitrator, does not meet the
tests of fairness and equity.”

Protest Meeting
Preceding the arbitration, the
miners, supported by all other
employees in the Mine Division,
stopped work to protest the com-
pany’s’-handling of "bids and its
denial of employees’ rights —‘ to
"bjid. jobs. The stoppage , occurred

on the second shift and contin-
ued through four regular shifts.

Chacon’s case was heard Feb-
ruary 14 in the company offices
in San Manuel. International

Rep. Frank Vettorel presented“

the case for the union, assisted
by Chacon, Local 937 President
Abe Yanez, Business Agent
Rudy Garcia, Grievance Com-_
mittee Chairman Fred Sanchez,
and Fred Van Hoose and Joe
Amador, as witnesses. ‘

" Local 929 Votes

Strike at Banner

TUCSON—-Mine-Mill Local 929 hasannounced plans

for a strike at the Banner Mining Company in Tucson. -

Negotiations with the company broke down, April 6 after

more than two months of bargaining. .
At a massmeeting on-Sunday, April 7,_the
ship voted to give their ‘negotiating committeeauthority, ~

in consultation with the Interna-
tional Union, to call a strikeat
Banner at whatever time the
committee thinks best.

The International Union has
already pledged $2,000 from the
Strike Fund and has given the
Local- assurances that more will
be forthcoming if needed. The
Local has also issued an appeal
to all other locals in the South-
west for pledges. of financial
support. - '

Proposals

Local 929 had proposed an
agreement to run to August‘ 1,
1964, calling for an average 9.6
cent per hour wage increase,
two week vacations after three
years, improved night shift dif-
ferentials, and changes in in-
surance and medical benefits
costing about 3.5 cents per hour.

The company countered with
an offer of a three year contract
providing wage increases of 3,
4, and 5 cents an hour in each
successive year.

In a letter addressed to all
local unions and staff members,
Maclovio R. Barraza, B o a r d
Member for District 2, Nicolas
V. Morelos, president of Local
929, and Theodore Martinez, fi-
nancial secretary of the Local
said: « V y -

Test-holing

“Test-holing for the Anaconda
Copper Company -in the mine
area, and the possibility of a
sale‘ of Banner properties in
Pima County to that company
give us a clue to reasons for the
form of the Banner offer. It ap-
pears possible that Banner
would like to be able to sell
Anaconda a group of workers
tied up in a long.term, low
wage contract, along with the
mine. It isn’t just the ground
that is being test-holed.” ‘

Miners’ wages at Banner are
close to $2 a daybelow wages

in other properties in the South- '

west.

_Tax Cut
RESOLVED that this conven-

tion go on record stating. that
President Kennedy's tax cut

proposal is not enough to head ~

off a recession and that we urge
passage of the tax cut of 10 bil-
lion dollars proposed by lead-
ers of AFL and CIO—a tax cut
in which the working -people

fits and not the huge companies
that will receive most of it un-

April.May.., . ‘

We- want to take time now to

publicly acknowledge the debt’

we owe particularly to Presi-
‘dent Fitzgerald of UE, Presi-
. dent Bridges of Longshore and
President Hoffa of the Team-
sters-—’the three unions who
came first and unquestioningly
to the support of Mine-Mill on
the conspiracy case. They were
the first to recognize that our
fight was one in which allcof la-
bor had a stake. They were the
first to recognize that labor’s
oldest slogan—-An Injury to One

 0 Is an Injury to All—was mean-

ingful and applied it-with
moral and financial support.
They came through, and we
hereby acknowledge our grati-
tude.

Here, too, we want to take
time, in convention, to express
our special thanks and appre-
ciation to five people of nation-
al eminence who recently joined
in a letter to President Kennedy
asking that he take steps to
bring the legal attacks on Mine-
Mill and its leaders to an end.
These five national figures are
Norman Thomas, Patrick E.
Gorman, Frank Rosenblum, A.
Phillip Randolph and John P.
Burke.

Norman Thomas has been in
the forefront of the fight for
civil liberties in America. He
has been a consistent supporter
of our defense from the begin-
ning and we here acknowledge
our gratitude for what his help
has meant.

Patrick E. Gorman, Gen-
eral Secretary-Treasurer of the
Amalgamated Meat Cutters and
Butcher Workmen, has by his
example in a long and effective
trade union life, and his stal-
wart support of Mine-Mill made
an immeasurable difference in
our campaign to enlist labor
support.

_Frank'Rosenblum, Gen-
5»T_,eral‘ Secretary-Treasurer of the

tough battle to raise» living
standards and working condi-
tions in its industry. His influ-
ence has hadia tremendous ef-

fect in helping to mobilize un- «

ion participation in Mine-Mill
defense.

A.- Phillip Randolph is Presi-
d e nt of the Brotherhood of

Sleeping Car Porters. As the‘

most important Negro trade
unionist in the United States,
and an outstanding leader in
the fight for civil rights, his
support has been indispensable.

John P. Burke‘, President of
the Pulp, Sulphite and Paper
Mill Workers; his active par-
ticipation over the years in our
fightback has been a source of
great satisfaction to us. We

hereby pay tribute to him and’

express our sincerest appre-
ciation.

To all of these——our thanks.
We know that our ultimate vin-
dication will be the result, in
large part, of the kind of labor
solidarity that these men and
thousands of others, have dem-
onstrated.

Retraining

RESOLVED, that the IUMM
& SW record itself as supporting
existing proposals for legisla-
tion providing for redevelop-
ment and retraining programs
as essential if we are to meet
the demands of modernized in-
dustry; and be it further
RESOLVED, that the Interna-
tional Union urge enactment of
Federal legislation providing for
aid to public education at all
levels-where there is at discerni-
ble need, in order that our
economy and our culture be in
no place deprived of full and
equal opportunity for survival,
expansion and improvement;
and be it further

RESOLVED, that Mine-Mill
urge all locals and ladies auxili-
aries of the Union to press for

V. such federal" aid and the:.expan-
sion of educational opportuni-.
.,.ties.. ~’ —  .  .

Defense Fund
The function performed by the
Defense‘ Fund "since 1953 has ,
been extraordinary. During this‘

_period, the expenses of defend-

ing our. leaders from .charges

A arising out of theperformance

of their duties have been enor-
mous. None the less, these ex-
penses have all’ been met, and
they have been met not by
drains on the General Fund of
the Union or by assessments
levied by the International Un- ‘
ion, but by voluntary contribu-
tions—$128,000 from our Local
Unions and their members,
$36,000 from the staff of the In-
ternational Union, and $80,000
from other unions and sympa-
thetic individuals all over the
country. .

The manner in which the of-
ficers and Executive Board
have managed the D e f e n s e
Fund is also highly commend-
able. These large amounts of
money have been raised under
their leadership and have been
expended under their careful
management. They have been
able to receive valuable aid
from the other unions. They
have also succeeded in securing
the services of highly respected
and outstanding lawyers to rep-
resent our brothers. All this
they have done with the most
careful and scrupulous financial
management, therefore be it

RESOLVED, that (1) we rati-
fy and approve all actions
which have been taken in con-'
nection with the Defense Fund,
and (2) we authorize the con-
tinuance of the Defense Fund
under the management of the
officers and the Executive
Board.

Federal Mine
ln.-s»pect-ion
Mine-Mi1l’s_ — legislative activi-
ties areenow bearing fruit. The
U.,S. Bureau of; Mines -is now,

and has‘ been, engaged in and
, extensive survey of safety con-

ditions in our non-coal mines. i

_ Many inspections by the U. S.
Bureau of Mines have been
made throughout the countryeand
although management does not
recognize these as legal inspec-
tions, nevertheless, a vast im-
provement has been made
through the U. S. Bureau of

‘ Mines inspectors’ suggestions.

In many states where state
mine inspectors are elected,
they use their office to play
politics instead of doing the
basic job for which they were
elected. Thus, the many unsafe
conditions which exist will con-
tinue to exist because of the in-
efficiency of our state mine in-
spectors.

We therefore call upon all
Mine-Mill mining locals, local
union safety committees, and
Mine-Mill statewide coordinat-
ing bodies in the mining areas
to continue to cooperate fully in
the program laid down by the
IUMM & SW in giving their
fullest cooperation to the in-
spectors of the US. Bureau of
Mines, and also to continue to
press for a federal mine safety
inspection and enforcement law.

Election Procedure

Unemployment .has b e e n
growing-for nearly fifteen years.
Each of _ the depressions we
have had since World War II
has seen more unemployment
than the one before, and in each
“recovery’.’ we have had more
jobless than in the previous re-
covery.

U. S. Government unemploy-
ment statistics have become al-
most meaningless. This is be-
cause the data omits the unem-
ployed who want jobs but have
given up the search for work as
hopeless. More than one million
persons are now in this category
and not counted as unemployed,
according to government defini-
tion. '

Loss of jobs has hit all sec-

tions of the non-ferrous. metals-

industry. The lead and zinc sec-
tion of the industry has been
injured by the government’s too
liberal import policies and by
the building of competing smelt-
ing facilities abroad. The Ken-
nedy administration has failed
to come to grips realistically
with the unemployment problem
that dogs our economic prog-
ress, or the specific problems
in our industry.

Major elements of a national
program essential to deal with
this problem‘ should include the
following:

(1) The 35-hour workweek
with no loss in take-home pay;

(2) An immediate increase in
the amount and duration of un-
employment benefits;

(3) A greatly expanded pro-
gram to retrain workers whose
jobs have been permanently
lost;

(4) An end to discriminatory
hiring practices;

(5) Purchasing power ex-
panded by shifting Federal and
State, tax burdens to a more
equitable basis, in accordance

with .the principle of ability to

(6) ' Much aneeded-.. public; .im- e .-

(7) Monopolistic pricing poli-
cies of the Copper Trust, which

are contributing to the loss of—

markets for copper, niust be

vigorously attacked under ‘anti--

trust laws;
(8) Adoption of an Interna-

tional Commodity Agreement

for Lead and Zinc; and

(9) The government should‘

proceed with caution in exercis-
ing the powers granted under
the Trade Expansion Act to

avoid further‘ loss of jobs by‘

-American workers.

Social Security

RESOLVED: that the delegates
to this convention go on record
requesting the legislature of the
United States to increase the

payments and improve the so-_

cial security for our senior citi-

zens in the following manner:

1. The age eligibility for social
security be lowered to age
50 for women and to age 55
for men.

2. That all senior citizens of
qualifying age be eligible for
social security benefits.

3. That the minimum monthly
payments be set at $200.00
per person.

4. That a National Health Pro-
gram for all senior citizens
be provided through Social
Security to assure adequate
and competent medical care.

a. Complete medical care.

c. Chiropractic treatments.
d. Osteopathic treatment.

When we seek to set up the guide lines. for bargaining
we all immediately see that
THE MOST SERIOUS ECONOMIC ISSUE FACING

THE AMERICAN WORKER TODAY IS THE GROWTH
OF JOB INSECURITY.

Chronic unemployment has become a permanent feature
of our economy—and it is steadily increasing in extent. Last
month the rate of unemployment, even judged by the short
weight under-reporting of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
edged up to above six per cent. Our industry has more than
reflected this trend.

In copper mining and milling, employment has declined
by more than 5,000 since 1956. Meanwhile, "production has
increased by ten per cent.

The Convention has adopted a resolution establishing the
35-hour week with forty hours pay as a bargaining objective.

"Premium Pay
RESOLVED, that:

1. We bargain for a five-day
consecutive work week with
premium pay for Saturday
and Sunday work as such.

2. No overtime be worked
while employees are on
layoff.

3. Where we have bonus plans
we seek, revision so that
workers will receive pay
one and one-half or double
time for production beyond
a normal work load, and
to stop employers from
combining jobs.

1.

RESOLVED, that:
We reaffirm our union's con-

tinued recognition" that free

labor unions can remain free
and can flourish only in a
free democracy in which the
civil liberties of all are re-
spected. We reaffirm our un-
ion’s policy of continued and
active support for the con-
tinuing struggle to preserve
the principles of civil liberties
against any and all threats.

.We commend Congressman

James Roosevelt for his mas-
terful delineation of the evils
of the continued operations of
the House Committee on Un-

American Activities, and we

voice our support for efforts,

to terminate this and ‘other’
similar relics of an era‘ when

the use of Congressional pow-

er as an instrument for char?

acter assassination and "po-

litical opportunism was more

accepted.

. We authorize and direct our

International Executive Board
to take appropriate action, by
ourselves or in concert with‘
likeminded groups, wherever-
possible to help prevent-any
attacks on civil liberties and
to help eliminate hangovers
of the restrictions of the era ,
of McCarthy. ‘

Apt-i|;'May,7 1953;} c  

Civil ‘-Liberties    

 

The 35-hour week is one part of a three-fold program to ‘
,_c,_., , create jobs and to reverse the trend of job elimination. We ' '
want to shorten the standard work-week, eliminate overtime
as far as possible, protect workers against the loss of earn-
ings from layoffs. -

These are the bargaining proposals to carry out those
objectives and meet the problem of job insecurity head on:

1. Substantially increased penalty overtime pay for all over-
time in excess of the standard workday and work week.

2. An industry-wide program of supplemental unemployment

~ benefits, and severance pay for all laid-off workers, re-
gardless of cause. _

3. Special three-month vacations for every worker with 15

years seniority, to be repeated every five years. These

vacations would be in addition to regular annual vacations
as set forth in our contracts. ’

Overhauling of pension plans to provide:

a. Payment of disability pensions in full in addition to
Social Security disability benefits;

b. Optional early retirement for workers between the age
of 60 and 65 at full retirement pay. This optional re-
tirement to be availableto any workers so qualified‘ in
event of proposed curtailment or layoff of younger work-
ers, and to be supplemented by severance pay so as to
approximate full combined Social Security and pension
benefits due at age 65.

c. In the event of permanent plant shutdown," vesting of all
accumulated service for pension benefits for all laid-off
workers. '

S; American labor movement at this time.

 -The International Executive Board in its meeting. of July
"’3i:9_6__g.,,i:eviewed the effects of:-raids in the United Stjatesand
‘Canada,’ ‘otherj=pi'oblems"confronting the Union, including the

'  financial .sit\1.i.1.tion. ‘As a: result of this review and assessment,

V ,the"Board .unan’imously concluded that we should explore

I -_‘_-‘with other unions, including Steel, the possibility‘ of a’prin-
1 cipledmerger. ‘ '

The Board further agreed that these conclusimis should

3, be -discussed and reviewed with the Canadian Executive
x  Board and‘ this was done. As a result of the joint discussions
‘ I -with the Canadian Board and the resistance in some sections
7 of our Union in the United States, it was agreed that no

‘meeting with Steel should be held.

-We did, however, hold exploratory discussions in friendly
atmosphere with Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Interna-
tional Union, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and
the International Association of Machinists. -

These discussions established very clearly that. there was
no immediate possibility of achieving merger with these
organizations.

 As a result of these discussions, it became evident that

 the Steelworkers would use their influence to block the con-

summation of any merger between our Union and any at‘-

' filiated union of the AFL-CIO. They gave notice of this intent

when at their convention last fall the officers of the Steel
organization were successful in getting a resolution passed

, giving them dictatorial power to withdraw from the federa-

tion at their discretion.

However, as a result of these experiences in exploring
the question of merger, the International Executive Board
has not concluded that the door to a principled merger is
forever closed. We must recognize that conditions favor-
able to merger, affiliation or labor unity do not exist in the
There is mounting
evidence, however, that important changes are taking place
that will shake the present stagnation in the American labor
movement; ~-

'I‘he Executive Board has, therefore, come to the conclu-
sion that in the current situation our responsibility is to

remain united so_ that we can make a contribution to a better-
’-labor movement. . '

c As the first step in this direction, the Executive Board
calls upon the Jmembersliip to put aside any differences that
" may jhave developed in our recent considerationof a merger

' and" to fully ‘ understand that our International ‘Constitution

permits no‘ officer or the Executive Board to make any com-

mitment or consummate any merger without referring this ‘

matter to a regular or special convention and a referendum
-vote of the entire membership. pr ’

_ Our Union must continue to develop, improve and extend
our working relationship with other unions in bargaining,
political action and other. joint endeavors that will advance

- the ‘interests of our membership. and the whole trade union
-- movement. ' ‘ . I ‘

The important and immediate responsibility ofthis con? i

vention and all of the locals of the In,ternational‘Union is -to

V support a positive program for 1964 bargaining, defeat of the *
.. raids, defense of our Union, and the maintenance and ad-

iHeall-In and   Welfare

, 'Mine-Mill has made significant strides in the past 10
years in negotiating an outstanding Health and Welfare
program for the membership.

The plans negotiated in such major chains as Kennecott, I

P.D., Anaconda and ASARCO are among the top plans in the
entire U. S. and the best in the nonferrous industry.

Mine-Mill has pioneered in a number of important pro-
visions now found in health and welfare plans. We were one
of the first unions to negotiate for prescription drugs. We
were among the first to negotiate continuation of coverage
for unemployed, sick and disabled members. We were among
the first in our industry to provide important outpatient bene-
fits not only for employees but for dependents as well.

In Arizona we succeeded in providing our members with

benefits outside of company hospitals and company doctors

for emergencies and specialistcare, thus making it possible

for our members who required expensive care to have a

good part of it covered under a negotiated plan of benefits.
Gain in '62

In ’62 negotiations we succeeded in bringing about a
substantial lowering of employee contribution toward the
cost of medical and other insurance programs.

Despite the progress made, and despite the outstanding
achievements, and despite the fact that thousands of our
members have a substantial portion of their medical bills
taken care of, we still have many gaps in our programs
which we should fill in our next round of bargaining.

, Based on our approach to bargaining in this field, the
Committee does not propose to spell out a master plan, but
again point up the major areas where the various bargain-
ing groups should concentrate in developing the specific
demands for their companies. a

Major Gaps

Major gaps, as we see them, are as follows:

1. Medical Care. Medical and hospital benefits should
be provided on a so-called service basis. That is, rather
than negotiate a given schedule of allowances for various
benefits, our demands should be formulated in terms of full
hospitalization for 365 days rather than X dollars a day

for room and board with Y dollars for other hospital
- expenses. Similarly, when we negotiate surgical benefits we

should negotiate -for whatever surgical care is required
rather than so many dollars allowed for a given surgical

I procedure.

2. Outpatient Benefits. The outpatient benefits for
dependents in a number of locals and bargaining councils
should be improved. The rapid advances made in medical
sciences require greater use of diagnostic and X-ray facili-
ties, and the allowances for such benefits in most instances
are insufficient.

3. In areas where the basic medical benefits are pro- .

vided through company hospitalsand company doctors, we
should insist on complete elimination of all restrictions on
medical care, elimination of surcharges, and above all,
make it possible for every employee and his dependent to
decide when they want to seek medical advice or hospitali-
zation care from non-company doctors or non-company
hospitals.

4. Employee Contribution. Elimination of employee
contribution. I

5. Continue Benefits. A minimum of two-year exten-
sion of coverage for disabled employees.

6. A minimum of six months extended coverage for
laid-off employees.

7. Coverage for Retired Employees. One of the major

. problems which must be tackled and achieved in next year’s
.bargaining. is medical and hospital care for retired em-

ployees fully paid for by the employers.

8. Dental Care. In the last three or four years a number
of unions have succeeded in negotiating comprehensive pre-
paid dental care either with insurance companies or with
prepaid dental plans sponsored by state dental societies.
As part of our program of extending security to our mem-
bers, we must tackle the dental care. in our .bargaining
next year.

9. Group Life. Group life insurance benefits equal to
annual earnings of an employee, with a provision that the
face amount be payable during the life of an employee in
case of permanent -and total disability. . .

10. Loss of Time. The loss-of-time benefit, or the so-
called weekly sickness and accident payments should be
leveled off at $75 per week, and the duration of the benefits
increased by an additional 52 weeks to provide greater se-
curity for our members who become victims of long term
disabilities and are not eligible for any such security bene-
fits.

11. Joint Administration. We must continue our de-
mand for a greater voice in the administration of the entire
health and welfare program. This is vital if we are to assure
that our members receive not only the actual benefits to
which they are entitled, but that the quality of medical care
provided under various plans is improved.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

> ,;n§eiI-i&dy.ii9is3 

O7, it Un-American Commiﬂees  

‘For the first time since the heyday of McCarthyism, the

' House Un-American Activities Committee is being seriously

challenged in the House of Representatives of the U. S. Con-
gress. The twenty Congressmen who voted “no” on the
HUAC 1963 appropriation on Feb. 27, 1963, represent the
most consistent leaders of a growing bloc of opposition to
HUAC’s assault on the Bill of Rights.

Over 80 Representatives pledging their support for Rep.
James Roosevelt’s Resolution to terminate HUAC’s status
as a permanent standing committee and recreate a new
subcommittee under the Judiciary Committee, but were
denied their right to vote for it by undemocratic House pro-

- . cedures.

Three Laws
In 25 years, HUAC has produced only three laws-—the
McCarran Act, the Communist Control Act of .1954 and the
Walter-McCarran Law—a legislative blueprint for American
fascism. If all major sections of these laws are fully sus-

- tained by the U. S. Supreme Court, our jails will be filled

with political prisoners and all organizations (including
unions) which dare to follow independent policies will be
outlawed.

The registration order issued against the International

 Unionof, Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers under the Control

Act of 1954 is a classic example of the repressive character

 of these laws--and a dire warning of what is in store for

American labor, if this precedent is upheld.

The Record
Look what the labor movement in the United States has

- - -been saddled with in the past 15- or 16 years: the Taft-Hartley
 Act, the Butler-Brownell Bill, the Landrum-Griffin Bill, and

these have only been made possible because of the atmos-
.-phere created by the Un-American Committee‘ and similar
, committees—an ‘atmosphere of repression, an atmosphere
of; attempting to limit the rights of all American citizens,

and when that happens the labor movement inevitably suf-

fers consequences.
‘ There are some labor leaders that are under the illusion

that they can thrive inspite of this atmosphere. They are

wrong. Look at the record oforganization of the labor move-

. ment in the past 15 or 16 years. The record is one which

says that the labor movement has not grown; that the labor
. movement’s inﬂuence has not grown; the labor movement’s
strength has not grown.

- The Results

In reality, in spite of our numbers in the States, the
"labor movement todayis weaker than it was 15 or 16 years

«ago. It has retrogressed in terms of its-political inﬂuence;

itrhas retrogressed in terms of its legislative accomplish-
ments.
And only when we return to the traditional freedoms and

.. liberties of our country will the labor movement in the United

Statesachieve its true stature; will we achieve unity in the
labor movement; will the organizational strength of the
labor movement once again rise to that which it should be
encompassing 30 to 40 million workers, will we have the
labor movement exercise the political strength it deserves
in the United States, and will we be able to move with dis-
patch towards the goal which this Convention is laying out
for our membership. Therefore, .be it

CANADIAN DELEGATIONAAT INTERNATIONAL UNION CONVENTION

Silicosis Survey

The.58th International Conven-
tion therefore urges that the
Public Health Service and the
Bureau of Mines make public
at the earliest possible date the
factual material which been as-
sembled in the course of the sil-
icosis survey, but that any con-
clusions drawn from this ma-
terial be presented with due re-
gard and note as _to the strictly
limited scope of the survey.

Specifically, this convention

believes that the survey should_
give adequate weight to the se-

rious and continuing dimensions
of the silicosis problem, the con-

tinued need for vigilance and.

improved dust c o n t r o 1 pro-
grams, the limited value and
significance of the impinger
dust samples taken, and to the
deficiences and limitations of
dust threshold limit values cur-
rently established in the United
States.

Finally, this convention be-
lieves that an explanation is in

* order as to the -exclusion of a

significant g r oup of miners
from the silicosis survey, when
it was determined that a com-
parable group would be includ-
ed in-the companion survey of
chest diseases among coal min-
ers. »

Brass C
. lmporl's-'l'ariffs

RESOLVED, that the Executive

Board of the IUMM & SW take
all steps necessary with the
U. S. Tariff Commission and/or
the -Administration to insure
adequate tariff protection for
the brass mill industry and un-
der all circumstances oppose
any attempt that may be made

to cut tariffs on brass mill

products.

"hazardous

Early Retirement

Early retirement, with full
benefits at age 60, for miners
and workers in other dangerous
occupations, is long overdue. It
is now part of the welfare law
of more than a score of ad-
vanced industrial nations. Early
retirement with special retire-

ment benefits for miners and-

others engaged in hazardous
work has been endorsed by .the
International Labor Office of the
United Nations.

Mine-Mill drafted a hill to
permit optional early retirement
of workers in hazardous occupa-
tions pursuant to action taken

'at't.he Tucson convention in 1961,

and it was introduced in the
second session of the 87th Con-
gress -in 1962.111; has been rein-
troduced in ‘the present session
of Congress by Congressman
Joseph M. Montoya (D. New
Mexico)‘as HR3096.

Early retirement compensates -

in part for the disadvantages of
shorter life expectancy in haz-
ardous occupations such as min-
ing, logging, certain types -of
construction, etc. Such occupa-
tions have accident rates three
times and more the average
rate for all U. S. industries. Oc-
cupational diseasehazards, in
addition, are especially high in
mining and certain other occu-
pations.

Because of the shorter life ex-
pectancy of persons working in
occupations, total
benefits paid should not be dis-
proportionate to total contribu-
tions to retirement reserves for
such persons, when compared
with total benefits and contribu-
tion for persons in other occu-
pations.

Optional early retirement with
full benefits at age 60 is not only
fair and equitable to those en-
gaged in hazardous work, it will

-proceed to some sort of action-
--ina.,Washington,, , . .. » -

also make a contribution to the
employment security of younger
and
in our industry whose jobs
are threatened by automation,
mechanization and speedup.

HR 3096 has "been referred to‘

the House Ways and
Committee.

Means
Our immediate ob-

jective is to obtain a hearing for

this bill by a House Ways and
Means Subcommittee e a r 1 y
enough in the 88th Congress to
permit this measure to be re-
ported for a vote by both houses
of Congress.

The 58th. International Con-
vention, therefore, calls upon
every local union, every . bar-
gaining council and every legis-
lativeiand political action coun-
cil to concentrate first upon ob-
taining a hearing for this bill.

-Congressmen representing dis-

tricts with ~ -Mine-Mill member-
ship should be urged to take this
up as a matter of primary im-

portance with the House Ways,

and Means Committee.
The convention calls upon the

. International officers to coordi-

nate these efforts, and to take
necessary steps. to mobilize
broad labor support for this bill
at subcommittee hearings and
as the measure is reported for
action by both houses of Con-
gress. ’

SAN FRANCISCO—-—The 15th Biennial Convention of the International Long5shor‘errie1i’s and Warehousemen’s
Union condemned the harassment. of Mine-Mill by the Subversive Activities Control Board and ordered a contribu-
tion of $5,000.from the ILWU general fund for the Mine-Mill Defense Fund.

In other actions, the Convention called for a stepped-up organiz

$1150, improvements in Social
Security coverage, and mclital
care for the aged.

, Independent Action

Attacking the AFL-CIO’s ‘de-
pendence on the Kennedy Ad-
ministration, the Convention
passed a resolution on “Indepen-

 dent Political and Economic

Action” which states that
“Labor must assert its political
independence of parties and
p0liticians—-if only to the extent
of the old Gompers slogan of
‘rewarding its friends and pun-
ishing its enemies.’.. It must be
prepared to drive forward on its
own program, utilizing whatever
politicians support it, but not
tailing after any political party.”

The Convention heard speeches

Harry Bridges

Bridges, in his keynote ad-
dress to the 248 delegates, lashed
out at attempts to discredit
striking unions, pointing out that
the East coast longshore strike,
the New York newspaper strike,
and threatened strikes of the
railroad clerks and telegraphers
were essentially attempts to hold
the line on job security.

, “These days,” he said, “using
collective bargaining strength
and economic solidarity has
gotten to the point where it is
considered intolerable; con-
sidered misuse and abuse of the
tremendous ‘monopoly power of
unions’.-

“What is in. the national. in-

"Hoffa hit the AFL-CIO leader-
ship for not being Iatjthe bar-

“The AFL-C10 has divided labor

said. “They are running away.

“ " by "the Subcommittee.

The Union is willing to turn
over to the Subcommittee all
records relating to the Defense
Fund except for the names and

addresses of contributors. To
do so, said Dichter, “would not_
,merely mean for us to sur-

render fundamental legal rights
but" to violate our deep .moral
obligation to the many indi-

viduals and labor -organizations’

who have voluntarily con-
tributed to causes they deemed
just.”

Dichter told the Subcommit-‘

tee‘ that if it wanted to know
whether specific persons or or-
ganizations had contributed to

the Fund, and “if it is shown.

that this information is related
to a proper subject under in-
vestigation” he would produce
such specific information. “To
go beyond that would sacrif.ice
the contributor’s rights of pri-
vacy for no valid.reason,” he

. said.

mittee that the Union was not

 attempting to conceal anything;

“It goes without saying that

mony the Subcommittee may re-
quire about the Defense Fund

tributors.” '

Dichter’s appearance was his ‘

Safely Resolution

The U. S. Bureau of Mines is
now engaged in the most ex-

tensive survey in its history of

safety conditions in‘ our non-coal

..mines.s It ‘ is -examining as ' well

the adequacy ‘of “state mine
safety codes’ and inspection and
enforcement programs. For the
first time it is collecting work
injury and occupational disease

data from the mining companies

on a mandatory basis, and is in
a positionto. evaluate the ade-
quacy of coverage of its work

injury reporting program.

This activity is the -result of
the passage of the Metallic and
Non-Metallic Mines Study Act
of 1961.‘ This bill was enacted
as a direct- result of a nation-

wide ‘lobbying campaign instiw
‘ tuted by Mine-Mill. s

The Bureau is required. by the
act to report its findings and
recommendations to the Con-
gress in September, 1963. .It is

important that the Bureau ob-
tain the full facts as to the dis- -

graceful safety conditionsin the
nation's non-coal mines if its re-

‘port is to laythe, basis for en-

actment of ourlong-time. goal,
federal mine safety inspection
and _enforce1n_e11t. A _

We ‘therefore call upon all
Mine-Mill mining locals, local
union safety " committees, and

-Mine-Mill statewide coordinat-

ing bodies in the mining areas

to cooperate fully in the pro-‘

gram laid down by the Interna-
tional Union in reporting alllost
time _and fatal accidents.

We c_all upon smelting and re-
fining locals to report such ac-
cidents on forms developed by
the International Union. This
will provide a needed check on
accidents which for several
years have been reported on a
voluntary basis by smelters and
refineries.

The Secretary of the Interior
next September will submit his
recommendations as to needed
additional f e d e r a l legislation
along with the report of his

» findings pursuant to the Metallic

and Non-Metallic Mines Study

-Act. We call upon the Interna-

tional. Executive Board to com-
municate the recommendations
of the union as to the scope and
content of such needed federal
legislation. These recommenda-
tions should include:
1. Federal safety inspection of
‘ non-coal mines, and non-fe_r-
rous ore treatment and re-
duction plants and refineries.

2.’ Adequate powers to‘ enforce

safety and health standards .

and practices at these estab-
lishments.

Management Blamed for Penna. Miner Explosion . . .
Ar Pollution in Lead Smeliers . . . Asbestosis in Idaho

In a hard-hitting report, a tough special state investigatory commission last month
blasted the superintendent, mine foreman and assistant mine‘ foreman at U. S. Steel’s
Robena coal mine at Carmichaels, Pa. where an explosion claimed the lives of 37 min-

ers last December 6. ‘

The Commission recommended that legal action be brought against the three

supervisors. The Pennsylvania
Justice Department said it
would meet with the commis-
sion to determine what specific
charges should be made.

The report charged the three
officials with failure to comply
with sections of the state min-
ing code and “for having acted
in a manner whereby the lives
or the health of the persons em-
ployed or the security of the
mine or machinery are en-
dangered.”

The Commission said the De-
cember 6 explosion was caused
by improper ventilation. It
found that while an adequate
amount ofventilation was
reaching the general area of the
blast, it was not properly di-

- rected to the mine face. A spark
from any of four. piecesof elec-

trical equipment in the area was
blamed for igniting a mixture
of methane gas and coal dust
at the mine face.

Question: Who ever heard of
an honest report. that laid it on
the line like this from a state
mine inspector in a hard-rock
mining state? '

Air Pol/ufion

Public Health Reports, month-
ly publication of the U. S. Pub-
lic Health Service, said in its
February issue, “A survey of
a secondary lead-smelting plant
in Pennsylvania‘ indicated that
lead concentrations in the air
exceeded the threshold limit
value by 100 to 170 times. The
plant was ordered to introduce
controls.”

“Threshold limit values” rep-
resent "conditions to which it is
believed that nearly all workers
may be repeatedly exposed day
after day without adverse ef-

.fect. These values’ are estab-
.lished bythe American Confer-.

ence of GovernmentalIndustrial
Hygienists.- - I .

The threshold limit value for
lead, indicating the upper safe
limit of concentration, is two-
tenths of a milligram of lead
dust, fume, or mist per cubic
meter of air. A cubic meter is
somewhat more than a ‘cubic
yard. Concentrations of lead
found at the smelter in Penn-
sylvania were from 20 to 34
parts per cubic meter.

Asbestosis

Existence of a possible asbes-

tosis hazard, dread lung,dis--

ease, was indicated in a U. S.

‘Bureau of Mines report of a

health and safety inspection of
the A.S&R Galena mine at Wal-

.lace, Idaho last ‘February. The
report states: , i

PD's Copper Queen Mine

TWO recent health and safety surveys of the Phelps Dodge
Copper Queen mine at Lowell, Arizona by the U. S. Bureau of
Mines listed ten safety improvements made during the surveys,
including the following: '

O In four underground locations, barrels of drill oil were
moved to untimbered sections of the drift.

0 A stick of dynamite and a detonator left in 114 crosscut were
returned separately "to their respective magazines.

OBurnt out electric light globes were replaced in several
haulage locomotives. -

0 Equipment and supplies were removed from in and around
and from in front of the gates of five underground transformer
stations. ' 

Seventeen other improvements were recommended, including
the following:

0 All belt drives, gear drives, flex couplings, V-belt drives,

‘drive, couplings, and drive shafts within 7 feet of the floor should

be provided with adequate guards. _‘

O The locomotive-battery-charging stationlonﬂ the 3,100 level
near the Denn shaft should be made fire-resistive or should be
moved to an untimbered location. I

O A cage guard should be installed on the ladder on the idler
tower at the junction shaft.

0 The bells on. locomotive Nos. 84 and 66 and the lights on loco-

motives No. 467 should be repaired.

O The battery-charging station in the dead-end drift on the 600
level of the Cole should be equipped with vapor-proof light fix-
tures.

O Definitive criteria should be established for determining the
suitable method of ground support for the various ground condi-
tions encountered.

0 Rock bolt anchorage should be spot checked several days
after installing the bolts. - -

O Manways should be wet down as often as necessary to pre-
vent them from becoming dusty. The manways in Dallas 2000-2820,
2000-286, and 2000-2770 should be wet down. Also the manway in
Cole 1300-108G.

wire should be guardedito prevent accidental contact with it.

“Our Bureau is dedicated to conservation,” heisaidp
“conservation of mineral resources and conservation ,-of?

Under Public Law 87-300, the Bureau has been_ con»:
ducting an extensive investigation into the causes» and , 
prevention of injuries and health .
hazards in non-ferrous mines.
Bureau inspectors have investi-
gated more than 160 fatalities
and have made more than 1,200
inspections of mines, quarries,
and sand and graved pits.

Sofel-y Survey

Ankeny noted that Mine-Mill
officers “have questioned the
accuracy of reporting to the
Bureau by some companies with
which A you have contracts. In
our processing (of injury and
employment data) we are striv-
ing to verify the accuracy as
well as the completeness of the
reports on injuries that are
submitted to us.”

The Secretary of the Interior
is required to submit recom-
mendations for mine safety leg-
islation based on the findings of
the Bureau’s report no later
than Sept. 26,1963.

The Bureau has recently pub-
lished. a series of three, pam-
phlets entitled, “Accident Pre-
vention in Nonferrous-Metal
