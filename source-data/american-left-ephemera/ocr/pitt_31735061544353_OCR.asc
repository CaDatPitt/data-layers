CALL TO ACTION F-‘DR LETTERS
TO KENNEDY

"There is an amazing strength in the expression of the will of a whole
people; and when it declares itself, even the imagination of those who
would wish to contest it is overawed. "

--Alexis de Tocqueville

The health and well-being of the present and future generations of man-‘ it
kind may seem to be directly in the hands of our federal officials and mili-
tary men who can make the fateful decision to resume atmospheric testing
of nuclear weapons. If we, the people of the United States, say nothing be-
fore the decision is made, we give silent consent to nuclear bomb testing
and the increase of radioactive fallout upon the earth. This period in which
the U.S. is not testing represents an opportunity to halt the spiraling arms
race. Should we resume testing, even the experts cannot forsee if or when
such another chance for a halt will come, and war in this case has been fore--
cast as "inevitable". Those opposed to atmospheric nuclear testing don't
have much time to bring pressure to bear upon President Kennedy for their
case.

According to reliable Washington sources. the President's decision
cannot be delayed more than a few weeks; observers estimate it will be
announced the first week of February. Realizing how monumentous his
choice is, he is reported to be more reluctant than his advisors to make
the affirmative move.

"The pen is mightier than the sword." It is more important now than
ever before in history that this concept be critically put to the test. Every
American citizen is making world history every day of January 1962 - through
their action or inaction - they are making.‘ they are determining history.
Democracy allows you to put men in office and control your representatives
once in office - a right long ago left by the -wayside by apathetic Americans.

What decision do you want the President to make? He is being pres-
sured to resume tests by the military, by those who fear the removal of
government defense contracts, by those who conceive of the threat of Soviet
expansionism as primarily military - rather than the greater economic and
political threat. These forces pressuring for testing have monopolized
the President's time, have confronted him constantly, have financed effective
lobbies -- and yet he hesitates. He hesitates waiting to hear from the people;
he hesitates knowing what consequences his decision may bring; he hesitates
although he feels little pressure from we who do not condone resumption; he
hesitates although our voices have been weakly heard.

We urge that now, before the decision is given - a few hours or days -

a tremendous appeal be made to President Kennedy not to resume nuclear
testing in the atmosphere. News bulletins state that preparation for testing
on Johnston Island and elsewhere are in full swing. But informal and formal
news announcements also indicate that "trial balloons" are being sent up to
find out beforehand how the public - you and we - will react to the renewal

of atmospheric testing. We must be heard ashloudly as those who oppose our
views. V\ e must be heard now. tomorrow may be too late. Are we to wait
in silent support of the arms race or are we to stand up and be counted - be
counted in greater numbers than the relative few, but powerful, military-
industrial elite.

WRITE THE PRESIDENT urging him NOT TO RESUME NUCLEAR TEST-
ING IN THE ATMOSPHERE. Contact as many other people in you community
as possible asking them to do likewise. THE TIME IS NOW}. THE DECISION
MAY BE OURS - LET 05 NOT 1.052: IT BY DEFAULT.
