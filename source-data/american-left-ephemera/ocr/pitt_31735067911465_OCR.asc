A FLURRY of last-minute set-
tlements on the eve of Mine-Mill's
strike deadline Wound up 1953
bargaining with the major non-
ferrous metal corporations in a
victorious climax. 9‘
Fighting all the way, Mine-Mill
locals from coast to coast had
battered down "every company
attempt to get away with “cheap"
settlements. Starting with the
break-through in American
Smelting & Refining Company,
where a 9-cent package was won
late in July, the union hammered
home similar settlements from

, the other members of the “Big

_ .Four.”

The settlements throughout the
industry, which compared favor-
ably with any this year by Work-
ers in steel and other basic indus-
tries,..were considered even more
remarkable because of the com-
pany cries of “poverty” as a re-

_LAST T0 SETTLE was the
Anaconda Copper Mining Com-

pany "in Montana, _which came,

through at the eleventh hour
With an offer ‘of 71/2 cents an

hour plus additional benefits.

“After our settlements in the
other three big chains, in the
American Brass Company and in
the Coeur d’Alenes,'we had Ana-
conda surrounded,” said Int.’l
President John Clark in com-‘
menting on the agreement. Clark,
as coordinator of the ACM Mine-
Mill Council, was present for
almost -all negotiating sessions

were suggested to B.__.C. Minister of Labor ‘Lyle.

cal1ed'iAugu_st 28 by the minister. ‘ '

"Among. important; points discussed,

, all of which received _ an‘ attentive

hearing, were those of making cer:
tification of unions voluntary,‘ allow-
ing’ the right _ to negotiate without g
coming‘ under, provisions" of the Act. if
the union-so desires, and rescindment
of a clause which in practice gives the
Labor+Relat.ions Bpoardwpower to de-,,
termine’ the u ion. to which Workers"
shall belong, regardless of their choice."
"Appended to, the last request ,'was"_

as

"the qualification that once an indus-‘ T

‘ited under the Act, that the LRB be-

made. responsible for. all. prosecutions
(at _p‘resent*__they simply give'leave to
.p1jos',e9ute)_,, th,at‘,a single. employee
should be made an appropriate unit
for collective bargaining, and that gov?
ernment supervision of strike votes-
should be eliminated.‘

_ Minor points included elimination‘ ~61:

made during a strike, and the eliniina-.
tion from the Act-of any clauses giv-

‘, ing ..the 'board_the right. .to._ interpret

THIS Convention celebrates the 60th
'‘’Anniversary of- our great Union. It
.. j5‘.now’_sixty years since a band, of 42

men‘ elected by hardrock miners in 16
‘camps scattered over Montana, Idaho,

U Colorado, Utah and South Dakota met

the‘ Butte Miners’ Union hall to form
4 union. They’ called it the Western
--Federation of Miners. Later the name
was changed to the International Union
of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers.
_ As we celebrate this Diamond Jubi-
,lee marking" six decades of fighting
unionism, we pay our hom-ageto the

the great victories ,— in the early days.
—Were against just -such attempts to
cut Wages. ' '  V
' We can recall the historic contribu-
tions our Union has made to the gen-
eral cause of labor unity. The record

is all there: our joining the’ AFL in l

1896, our launching the Western Labor
Union in 1897, our participation in“
the‘ IWW during its earliest begin-
nings, our rejoining the AFL in 1911,
and our contribution to the founding
of the C10 in 1935. ,

Attack" on leaders-

We can recall the. importance our
Union has always placed on the right
of its members to choose their own
leaders‘ without interference by the
employers, the government or any-
body else, and to support its elected
leaders in their effort to‘ carry our
deniocratically-reached policies and‘
programs. ' ’ B A ,. p

"The rank-and-file membership has
kniown’fi-om the beginning that when
their,.leaders are attacked by the em-
ployers or employers’ representatives,
they and their union are a tacked.
There is ad close -parallel between the
1907 trial of Big Bill Haywood on
framed-up charges, of murder, and the

current indictment ~of Clinton Jencks 

on frame'd-up Taft-Hartley charges.

As we meet here tiodayifor the 49th
.\Convention of our ‘Union, profound
changes are taking place both in the
~ United States and Canada. A truce has
been signed in -Korea; a new Adminis-
tration sits in Washington;
struggle for national independence is
shaping up in Canada; radically new
, opportunitiesvfor labor unity are open-
ing up. A _\ S ”
. t ' C .
THE BIG CORPORATIONS ‘in both
, »U.S. and Canada, now more entrenched
than‘ ever in .the seats of gov\ernment,
are operating openly and aggressively’
to smash the‘ llaborimovement a'nd"set
up as “labor front” on the patternof
Nazi Germany. Organized labor, which
has grown ‘strong’ in the last 20
years, is now ‘faced with an" assault
unm_atched since_ the days of the
Palmer ‘Raids in- the 19205. When
- Dwight ‘ Eisenhower took . office’ _a_s

peted: “Business expects benefitsfrom

G0/P victory.” And thefirst “b_enefits”l"_’

on which business, moved to cash in
were the giveaway—takeaway" steals,

lthedemands for" new laws to shackle‘ \
labor, the budget cuts which hit serv- ' -

_ ices to the people_‘jmost* sharply. _
‘Workers’ rights won’ during a period

of -great pro_'gress'5:~in both ycoilnti-ies-‘-=
"are today being challenged directly, as 
- Congri-Lss ‘and Parliamentiundercut oII_e._ ._

8. new ‘\

The defense of civil rights, a grow-_

ing problem’ for several years now,
has reached the crisis stage, as,Mc-

Carthyism in the U.S. and Garsonism f

in Canada moves toward a crest‘ of
hysteria.
People fighting back
But the people and the labor.move-
ment are fighting back. This is in keep;

ing with what we see by glancing back .

at the events of our Union’s 60-year
histor.y. Today we have an Eisenhower
administration boldly controlled by Big
Business; yesterday we had McKinley
and Harding administrations just as
boldly controlled by Big Business. The
people are emoﬁﬁg into battle t_oday
just as vigorously as they fought
against the corporation and govern-
ment excesses of yesterday; ,
The Korean truce signed this sum-
mer was _la;;sig'nal.victory for all the
' people of our two countries and'of‘ the

‘whole world. It was, after all, the,

pressure of _the people for peace, and
the inability of the MacArthurs to
‘fsell” the people on an extension of
the war, that made this truce possible.

Working‘ people in the U.S. and
Canada. look upon'the signing. of the
truce as a crucial step opening the
way to negotiations. amongall the
majorpowers to bring an end to world
tensions. They are convinced that such
negotiations can and should take place
soon, and that they ‘can bear fruit
which will have. genuine meaning to
the security and well-being of the
whole world. i

I'M SURE the people of the United
States and Canada agree withn our
Mine-Mill National Wage Policy Com-
mittee’s statement, made in July, that
“our attitude toward the approaching
peace has nothing in -common with the
Knowlands and 'McCarrans who view
it as aithreat. Nor do we concur with
some spokesmen for labor. who have
accepted Big.Business thinking to the
extent of fearing that peace must
mean depressionf," ‘ ' .

Canadian’ and ;U.S. working people
are not in any mood to take a depres-
sion lyingsdown. More andmore voices
are being lifted in demand for wide-
scale, extensién of "world trade, Which-
could do so much to 'solve.the prob-
lem of jobs now that the arms drive

can be slackened off. Louder and loud- 

er comes the question, “Why isn't
something being done to plan’ for pub-
lic works?” ~ .
How ready and willing the people
are’ to be niobilized to fight depression
can be seen by the reactions to our
campaign in the lead-zinc industry.
That campaign must now be broadened
and carried further. We refuse‘-to ac-
cept the idea that any part of our in-
,’dustry is, or can xbe, “permanently sick.

Al wave of indignation and _ p_rotesf- -

against McCarthyism and __its'.v_iciou_I

_ our_ own industry, vvaﬁ found that,"
wherever we mobilized with vigor and,
in unity to showthe employers that

« we meant business in our demand fa‘
a‘ substantial wage increase this year,
we won such an increase. '.

Lqbor, unity
But it is in the field of labor unity -
-» that we find the most dramatic ex-
ample of gearing tovfight back against
the ,“new reaction” in business and,
government. The pressure for real.
unity _in the labor movement has in-
creased tremendously in thermonths
since Eisenhowey took office.

_So much has happened just inltho ’
last-half year that we can already say
the outlook for labor unity is immense-

 ly different. and radically improved
over_what it wasi ‘when, we last me in
Convention. ‘ I, .

If we were merely to ‘list the large ’
number of “no-raiding”
th’at have been signed in these recent-
months, we would ’readily conclude
that big strides forward have
taken. These pacts, limited’ as
are, clearly mean that most ofthe la-
bor movement has finally learned that
raiding is profitable only to the em-
ployers, that nothing is gained by it
for tlie workers, that the time has. come
to scrap this type of “organizing."

0

.THE OTHER SIDE of the “no raid-.
ing” coin is joint bargaining and joint.
action on a number of fronts to protect
and advance the interests of the work.-
ers. Here, too, we see a great deal‘ of
evidence that the pressure of the rank-
and-file in a Wide variety of industries
has already led to promising agree-
ments between unions that bargain
with the same e1nploye1‘s.

‘In our own 'indu_st.ry, both in 

\ United States and Canada, we have

been making good progress toward our
objective of finding commotr approach.
es withother unions. The two shining
examples, of course, are the formation
of the National Anaconda Conferenct
in the U. ‘_S., and -the Hamilton‘ confer-
ence on labor unity in Canada. ' '

The Anaconda Conference must be.

strengthened, extended and made ‘to’ ' - 5

work more effectively in the interests‘
of the thousands of Anaconda workers. ,

Similar unity steps must be taken inf .

' the other chains and the other
of our industry.

RELATIONSHIP   T0 u.s.  

is - nu OUTSTANDING fact ‘in Canada
 \' today is the increasing domination

of its economy by the United ‘States
and the consequent increiising depend-

" “once of Canada both economically and
._T _politically on the U. S. Canada has a

"dependent war economy tied to that of

 the United States.

_ Canada has a war budget of its own,

amounting to $2 billion a year, just

under 10% of the country’s total pro-

f...l,ducti'on of goods and services. -In addi-
:;itio’n, an enormous natural wealth in
 raw materials is being rapidly devel-

oped and exploited to supply the U. S.
war?-economy. Much of this develop-

 3 .ment is being done with U. S. capital,
"and the bulk of Canada’s raw materials
\production is sold topthe U. S.

Key sectors of Canada’s industry are

:'—also owned and controlled by U. S. 
_. monopolies. Canada is thus becoming

‘re. source of supply and an industrial
adjunct to the U. S. economy and world

0
__ALL.OF ‘THIS is not taking place

7against the will of Canada’s own mo-

-1'1opoly,'g'1_'oups. This is shown, for ex-

'‘ample, by the relationship’ of foreign
"investments in Canada and "Canadian
investments abroad. '

 If there are now more than $10 bil-

B"-‘lion_ invested by other countries in Can-

‘ad'a‘,! of which $8-billion are from the
'S.,-at the same time Canadian. cap-
lists and the government hold a total

3of($6 billion foreign assets. A major .

spdrtion of this total is in the form of
-government war and post-war credits
 loans to other countries, but there
‘-are: also large private investments in

Again, as regardsqthe Canadian war

budget of $2 billion, not all of "this by. —.

-V and Wall Street. As Lester Pearson,

Minister of External-Affairs, expressed
it, Canada is “playing second fiddle to
the U. S.” To show that Canadian

' policy;is mainly the result of coopera-

tion. and not compulsion, he said that
there was “no disgrace in playing sec-
ond fiddle. . . . The second fiddle is a
respectable instrument and is very im-

portant if the orchestra is trying to i

play a symphony." ,_ ,..

, Canada as “second fiddle” is not al-
“ways willing to. play V the symphony
dictated by the U.’ S. Thedifferences
find expression mainly in two fields:
U. S. trade policy and Asia.

The increasing domination of Can-

ada’s economy by the U. S. is shown‘

in many ways. Three aspects of the

dependent relationship deserve special
emphasis: Canada’s position as a source
of raw materials, with the result that
most of its.exports go to the U. S.;
Canada as the largest market for. U. S.
foreign goods; and Canada as afield
for capital investments and super-
,profitable exploitation by U. S. Big
Business.

~ Paley report

Canada’s position as a source of raw
materials for the U. S. was fully de-
scribed in the Paley report, a U. S.
government dbcument. The report laid
it down that the -United‘ States fnust
adopt the policy.,of getting raw ma-
terials at the lowest cost wherever de-
pendable supplies were to be found. The
essential purpose, both from the point
of view of U. S. industrial growth and
“national security,” was to insure an
adequate and constant, unhindered flow
of raw materials. ‘ . ' . ‘

For this, the U. S. must look chiefly
to Canada, Latin America, Africa, the
Near “East and South and Southeast
Asia. .The title of the Paley report

- was ‘-‘Resources for Freedom;” that is

to’ say, the freedom of Wall Street to A
’ exploit these countries to its own ad-_

vantage and profits as it sees fit. .

Indeed, onlya‘ short time ago, Presi-

As to trade, in 1950-52, 59% ofall 
Canadian exports went to ,the United
States. This compares with 37% in —
the years before the war, and 38%
in the years‘ immediately following
the war. In 1950-52, 70% of imports
came from the U. S. This enormous
proportion grew up during the war,
when ‘other’ .countries from -which
Canada had previously‘ bo_ught were-
engaged in fighting or were loccu-~
pied by thenenemy. C A
V In the first half of 1953, the pro-
portion increased to 76%, compared
with 63% in the years before the war.
Taking servi es as well as goods into
account, 15%

20% of everything she uses comes from
the,U. S. ‘ i

As regards investment, recent years .

have seen a tremendous inflow of Unit-
ed States capital to Canada, and the
increasing ownership and control by
the U. S. of key raw materials and

.manufacturing industries which should
_ rightfully remain the ownership of the

Canadian peqple. ' '

ACCORDING TO official govern-
ment figures, total U. S. investments
in Canada now stand at $8 billion. U. S.
investments in the mining andgsmelt-'
ing industry are over $500 million,
equal to 35% -40% of the total book
value, and are increasing. Already in
1950, U. S. investments in Canada’s oil
industry amounted to over half of the
total, and since then ‘further hundreds
.of millions -of, dollars have been in-
vested in it. I - ’ B

Aluminum in” Quebec and -British Co-.

lumbia, asbestos and-the iron "ore de- I

velopmentin Ungava are -further ex-
amples of growing U. S. ownership of

» Canada’s basic‘-rawpfmaterivals and na-

tural wealth. Regarding manufacturing ‘
industry, official figures _admit that in
1950iU. S. ownership amounted to over

'$2 billion and. was. equal 'to- 37% of
' the total bok value. The automobile in-

THE COMBINATION of exports
concentrated to’ the U. S. and owner-
shfp and control of production" by U. S.
Capital is perfectly illustrated by the
non—ferrous metals .industry. ‘As stated, '
U. S. investments in this‘ industry
amount to over $500 million and are
increasing.

dustry are. all U. S.’ owned or,con.

Sound Company, Hudson Bay Min-

panies are Morgan, du Pont, Mellon ' I
and _Rockefeller,' the giant -trusts 

which control the U. S. economy.

All but a tiny fraction of the nickel
produced in Canada is exported, and

y of these exports 70'%_'go to -the U. S.

Before the second World war, the fig-

ure was only 40%. Fifty-three‘ per cent-  3, ,

‘pre-war; 56% of zinc compared to 3%

per-war, and 28% of_ copper compared

_ to 14%‘ pre-war. . ~
Sixty perxcent of Canadian silver ’

production goes to» the U. S. and of

course all of Canada’s gold production

is bought by the Canadian government
at the price of $35 U. S. an ounce,
which means that the U. S, eventually
gets all the gold at half its true value.

Further, Canada’s entire uranium
production, -goes to the U. S. and" is

this ‘country for decades, who have
raised families, and many of whose
sons have fought in the armed serv-
ices. Most of those picked up and held
for deportation were active in their
early years in the trade union move-
ment.

Of equal seriousness,,the age of the
labor frame-up returns to’America. Us-
‘ing. the loosely-worded monstrosity, the
Taft-Hartley Act Non-Conformist Af-
fidavit, which over 200,000 trade un-
ion lea\ders have signed, the Attorney
Generail"‘s‘office has begun to secure
indictments and convictions in courts
of militant labor leaders.

The Assistant Attorney General in

-charge of the criminal division, an-

swering a question to the House La-
bor Committee, said:

“It is expected that in the near fu-
ture there will be more such. indict-
ments.”

The Jencks case

Such anti-labor“action on the part of
the Department of Justice has already
hit our union. Our International Rep-
resentative Clinton E. J encks, who
fought long and hard to rally the work-

ers. in the Southwest, in order to pro- ‘

tect and advance the living conditions,
and equalize the contracts in this area
with those of all our members in the
Big Four bargaining councils, has re-
cently been indicted. The charge-
swearing “falsely” in a non-communist
affidavit.

The trial is yet to take place, but we
are sure that every anti-labor, anti-
democratic element who hates our un-

ion-and wants it‘ destroyed will appear
, against Brother Jencks. "

Perhaps we can best indicate the
type of action the indictment of Broth-
er Jencks really means if we quote
from the testimony of Mr. Richard,C.
Bérresford, laborqrelations director of

‘ New‘ Jersey Zinc Co., parentcompany

of Empire Zinc, where our union con.-
ducted a long "and successful strike in
New Mexico, and is engaged in another
strike in Colorado as this is being

. written, to win conditions equal to
’what we have with other companies.

Mr. Berresford,‘ testifying before the
House Labor Committee’, said: “We are
not trying to destroy this union. We
are trying to give it proper leadership.
. .‘s . I propose to catch the Integnational
Representative who is in the pay of the

International Union or occasionally in ‘
the pay of the local union butworking
full . time.” ‘ ‘ ‘

Clinton Jencks‘ ‘fits 7Mr. Berresford’s
description. , ’

Attack on -whole union

W e . cannot take _.-this l_.thre_at ‘to i our '7
, union lightly. ‘The in'd_ictment‘of.Broth-«_;
er ;Jencks . is an‘. attempt - to indict our",

\

entire union. It is more than that. It
is an attempt to weaken the entire la-
bor movement. '

In addition, the Department of Jus-
tice has indicted Hugh Bryson, presi-
dent and’ long-time leader of the Ma-
rine Cooks and Stewards Union, on
the same flimsy basis as Brother
Jencks.

As we pointed out when the witch
hunters were not stopped in their first
attack, they went on to hound an ever
greater number of liberals and pro-.-
gressives. So_in the cases of 'Brothers
Jencks and Bryson. Unless this attack
is stopped, it cannot be long before
Taft-Hartley indictments will be used
against even conservative AFL leaders.

Although the Dgmocratic Party

‘as yet has not taken on the‘real fight

for full peace and prosperity, we can
definitely say that the mood of the
people is changing.

Mostencouraging of all is the grow-
ing revolt against extreme Republican
reaction, typified by McCarthyisni.
Religious leaders, educators, students,

top-flight scientists and now labor
leaders, are beginning to speak out
against Velde, Jenner and McCarthy.

Mrs. Agnes Meyer, wife of the head

.of the influential Washington Post,

first threw down the gauntlet when she
called upon the American people ‘to
come to the defense of our public
schools. ‘ ‘ —

The/Princeton chapter of the Amer-

ican Association. of University Pro- '

fessors ‘warned, “against inquisitorial

~procedures to determine fitness to _

teach.”

A group of 56 Massachusetts educa-
tors attacked the Jenner Circus as“
“contributing to a subtle breakdown in
our Democratic processes.”‘

Dr. Albert, Einstein, top world'scien-
tist, Henry Wriston, conservative pres-
ident of Brown University, and Dean
Ackerman of the Columbia School of

Journalism‘, all have indicated‘ strong .

opposition to the limiting of‘ free and
unorthodox expression.

- AMONG the religious groups, per-

Chaps the most powerful, the General
‘Board “of. _the National Council of
~ Churches of Christ -in the U.S.A., rep-

resenting over thirty denominations
and thirty-five million members, ,con-\
demned the methods o'f’Congress’ional\
Committees and set up itgoxvn watch-
dog “Committee on the Maintenance of

~*An1€:ric_an Freedom.”

Even‘ more encouraging, all labor,
left, middle and conservative, awakens
to the danger. The large and powerful

 United Automobile Workers in con-

vention spoke . out against , the f_‘step-

;_gl;y.step. rule of‘ fear_-band _'sme=ar,’_’\ called

fun

i The AFL Hotel and Restaurant it " ’
Workers took very similar action call- "

ing for" repeal, of the witch-hunting
laws. as did the CIO’s ‘United Packing-
house Workers. .

This changing mood of the people
perhaps finds its best expression among.
our minority and nationalcgroups. The
National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People, the Urban
League, the National. Negro Labor '
Council, the organizations of the Mex-
ican-American people, have not only
come out against the philosophy of
McCarthyism, they have done more.
They have begun to make the fight
for full political rights and ‘equal eco-
nomic‘ opportunity.

The most outstanding advance made
in the past few months was when an
independent organization led by the
Negro people in the District of Colum-
bia, known as the Committee for the
Enforcement of the Laws of 1873, won
a victory when the Supreme Court
ruled that all restaurants in the Dis.
trict of Columbia must serve all peo.
ple without discrimination.

Yet neither ‘President Eisenhower
nor the Republican Party have made
any start on ‘legislative measures to
end segregation in the District of Co-
lumbia, a pledge _he repeated on eight ,
separateoccaslons before election day
last year. The only civil rights mea-
sures for the District of Columbia in-
troduced so far in this Congress are
sponsored by, Democrats.

MEANTIME, Negro Workers in gov.
ernment and in government contract.
plants, who were the last to be hired,
are now finding themselves the first‘

to be fired in the budget—cutting lay-
offs. A

All decent Americans, and especially
white and Negro,trade unionists, are
watching with great interest the prog-
ress of the historic cases now before

- the U. S. Supreme Court, the long fight

to outlaw segregation in schools, rail-
roads, restaurants and all other pub-
lic places. The Court, which heard the
arguments in these cases months ago,’
is expected to hand down its decisions
some time this fall. How it rules will
be a measure of this Court’s respon-
siveness to the clearly spoken demands
of not only the 15 million Americans .
who are Negro, but of all Americans
who believe in genuine democracy.

It is worth noting that even Presi-
dent Eisenhower felt it necessary to
respond to the pressure of the Negro

people when, this summer, he issued
his executive order against discrimina-
tion in employment in government con-

tract plants.  I

However, the order by-, itself does
not mean an end‘ to the ﬂagrant dis-
crimination which has been practiced
by many government contractors. The
power to end violations of the Presi-_
dent’s order rests with the head of each
federal agency which lets such con-
tracts. Enforcement powers should be
taken out of the hands of federal agen-
cy heads who have not and will not use
them, and put in the hands of the FEP
Committee which the President's Or-
der set up.

Recordfar from good
Actually, the record of the Admin-.

‘istration thus far on minority rights is

far from good. The President has not

-made a single top-level appointment of ‘

a Negro. His appointment of the racist
Governor. Byrnes as a U. S. delegate to‘
the United Nations shocked and an-,
gered all minority groups in the coun- v
try.

While the ‘President issued an order’
to “abolish" segregation in schools at
army posts, a member of his Cabinet
then sent out a lengthy memorandum
urging that action be delayed until a
new ‘_‘survey” could be made—_though
there are at least three exhaustive re-

The agitation for Fair Emplnyment

some unions, there is increasing recog-

I day-to-day basis for the rights of mi-

nority brotl1crs—not only on the job,
but in restaurants, hotels,» schools and
so on.

The fact that the Negro people are
on the march in this country is drama-
tized by the stepped-up a_ttacks on out-
standing Negro leaders. Bishop W. J.

It was only through the rallying of
the Mexican-American people of the
state of New Mexico, together with
many others, that the arch-reactionary
Patrick Hurley was defeated, and the
liberal Senator Dennis Chavez re-
elected.

Then followed a fight of many

months, initiated by Hurley and en-

cline, according to present plan.-;. to
"about $40 billion. Thus one of our
main sources of economic growth is
scheduled to peter out.

5 LOWER INVESTMENT IN NEW

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Ex- ~

penditures for new plant and .equip-
ment, largely based on war orders, was
one of the, main stimulants of the re-
cent boom. According to the most op-A
timistic estimates, they are due~for a
decline. Such expenditures totalled
$27 billion in 1952. .

This program is now nearing coni-
pletion and according to  S.‘News
and World ‘Report for June 19, 1953,
94 percent of the program will be com-
pleted by the end of 1954. '

Also, building construction has be:-n
slowing down. Contracts for new
buildings so far awarded have been
running below last year.

Aﬁ  $REIGN TRADE CRISIS:
." Further..aggravating all of these
tendencies has been the growing crisis
in foreign trade. Foreign markets for
U. S.—pr_oduAced goods are declining and,

‘ so long as‘preseAnt policies are contin-

ued,"will decline still further.

‘The importance of foreign trade for
non-ferrous-metal workers can be seen
in this one fact—in2a. near “normal”

- Lastyear, U. S. total exports, were

A about the. same as in 1951, but when:
war goods, most of which were. given 
away, are deducted‘, there was a 6 per- 
cent. decline in the amount of actual V

goods sold. Non-military shipments ‘to
Western Europe dropped 19 percent.
Our “give away” program for next
year has been cut -drastically. ’

Our embargo on goods sold to Rus-
sia, Eastern Europe, and China has not
only shut us off from growing large

markets, but by disrupting traditional «. T
trade of Western European countries A
with these areas, has made,it_ that Amuch-» --
-more difficut for even Western l3.'u- ¥

rope to buy the things we produce.
. .

THESE ARE AMONG the factors‘
which add up to a total situation that
seems to be developing into an eco-
nomical slide that would be very dif-
ficult to control. We._have no_ way of
knowing how soon or how fast a de-
pression would develop. ‘In fact, some
believe that before any serious crisis
got under way the Administration

would step up military spending as a*_

further stimulant to the economy. ,

Whatever temporary stimulation V
such new spending would give would ‘

offer no real solution. More spending
now could only be done through heavier
taxes for which workers and "other
consumers would. have to pay. And
more taxes now would still ' further.

, weaken buying power, so that even if _’ A
a temporary respite were won, the, ulti- ‘

mate crash would be that much harder.

  'rwo ROADS AHEAD

For us and for all other workers, the. 7
economic situation poses many serious
problems. Unless the present trend of
events can be reversed, we will in time
be facing more serious unemployment, '

short work.‘ weeks, attempts to, cut
wages, higher taxes, and‘ still_further
repression of unions in order to crip-

ple all efforts to fight back in defense ‘

of the" workers’ security. V

C uf-backs, lay-offs, war

Certainly this is the direction ‘in
which BIG Business, which now runs
the show in -Washington, will try to
move. 1 V.

recognize the

Recognition of these dangers formed
the basis of our “World at Peace” pro-
gram which we adopted at last years’
convention. We can repeat now as we
said then:

“Mine-Mill’s policies“ have been guid-
ed by the belief that our vast produc-
tive powers can be kept in operation
without building a gigantic military
system and without preparing for war.
We believe, as we have said pn many
occasions, that peaceful production can
be organized in such a way as to elimi-
nate both war and depression.” -

C

THE PROGRAM which we then
adopted is more timely and important
today than when it was first projected
a year ago. Today, many more people
' real possibilities. of
achieving peace. Today, many more
people see the -need for planning for
peaceful production. Today, before it
is too late, we must find ways and
means of uniting with all honest ele-

F ments to make our program a reality—--

to help set this nation on the'path of
peace and prosperity.

_Today the need for a radical change

.in our foreign policy is recognized by

the most diverse elements in our soci-
ety. The bankruptcy of our “cold war”
policies is evident on many fronts.
From all sides comes increasing evi-
dence of growing hostility to the U. S.
and its policies. ’

Views on foreign relations

Walter Reuther, CIO president, re-
ported‘ after his recent trip to Europe
that “.even American embassy people

‘ concede the U. S. position in Europe,

has dete7riorated' and that our prestige
is at an all time low.” (CIO News,
August 24, 1953.)

William Philip Simms, former for-
eign editor of Scripps-Howard news-
papers and. a recognized authority on
European affairs, reports:

“We are losing out in Europe. How-
ever good United States policy_ may

.-have been in the beginning, here in

Western" Europe it is petering out.

“Thebiggest peril to American peo-
ple to day is not Soviet Russia, but the
growing anti-America-nism h ere in
Western ‘Europe. And it is rankest
among those for whom we have done
the most.” (San Francisco News, Au-
gust 10, 1953.) ’ ‘ ' .

Summing up European attitudes on F

the‘ present differences’ "between the
Western and Communist worlds, Er-
nest T. Weir, Chairman of National
Steel Co., reports in hisprinted broch-
ure “Notes “On the Foreign Situation
Based On a Trip Aboa/rd”— '

“The European attitude. toward the

situation now existing between the
Western’ and Communist worlds may be .-

stated in three sentences:

1. They feel that Europe_annations l I 1
cannot continue to spend" the, large _-

_amounts presently devoted-jto_ de-

* fense because they have neither the 

' money nor the "credit. A»

- from Russia.
meeting with open minds, in a spirit.

 Peace,iAtrade, public works

W5 should enter the

of give and take, prepared to negotiate
a peace on a fair a-nd honorable basis.

.This, of course, is substantially the
position which we have advocated for
a long time. It is also the position
which the UAM-‘C10 adopted at its
convention this year when the delegates
overwhelmingly declared that “the road
to peace must be kept open” and called
for efforts “to find a basis for negoti-
ating settlements of issues which
threaten war between the communist
and free nations of the world.’

Practical business approach

That Ernest T. Weir should arrive
at such a position is of exceptional sig-
nificance. Weir is head of one of the
largest independent steel companies in
the U. S. He is a1 Republican /and a

staunch Eisenhower supporter.‘ He has’
been notoriously anti-New Deal and
» anti-labor.

His views are obviously, not the re-
sult of any liberal or idealistic senti-
ments. .They arelbased on hard-headed,
practical business considerations. They
are based on the belief that peace will
offer great opportunities for economic
advances. Says Weir—-

“. . . Everything we have will be
worth more if we have genuine peace
than if we have war or continuance of
the present tension. We have become
so accustomed to a war economy that
some people think we must have it to
sustain employment and production.
The plain fact is thatlwar production
is economic waste. All the great ad-
vances in human history have come in
times of peace. If peace can be estab-
lished, the prospects for development
of the world economy are so great that
there‘ is not an individual any-where
who will not benefit. I am convinced
that with peace we__will stand on the
threshhold of one of the great forward
movements in history.” , 1 '

We know that Weir does not speak
for all leaders of business. We also

might not agree with Weir on /what /

steps should be taken, once peace is

assured, to guarantee continued high

production and employment. We can
‘agree, though, that at the moment, the

overwhelming need is for “a positive‘

approach, to peace.’.
0

-A ='rwo YEARS AGO, at our 46th con- A
I vention, we outlin'edlt_he stepswhich we 1‘

felt would assure world peace. These

_ "steps were: _

1.. Full restoration ‘of peace in Ko1'.,e’a“.‘i

' 2. «Immediate negotiations among the A

five p_o_vrers—including China-leading
_ to settlement of all outstanding differ-

_e_n_ces. A . A - ‘

4 East.

3. An agreement on controlled dis-
armament, and elimination of all weap-
ons of mass destruction.

These proposals have not asyetrbeen
fully realized, but , we can certainly
record some progress toward their
achievement. The truce in Korea can

and should. lead to a full peace in that

war ravaged land, despite incendiary
efforts to again ignite the fuse. The
demand for negotiations among the

‘great powers is, as we have shown,

gaining in strength. From such nego-
tiations . there would undoubtedly re-

.sult some understandings on disarm-

ament 'and control of destructive wea-
pons.

Another very positive result of the
casing of world tensions would be a
vast increase in world trade which, as
we elaborately show in our “World at
Peace” program, would bring incal-
culable benefits to U. S. workers and,
in particular, to non-ferrous workers.
In fact, even ‘now, before all differences
have been resolved, an increase in trade
between the East and West would help
to relieve much of the‘ present tensions.

Canadian view

The Financial P o s t, conservative
business organ in Toronto, speaking on
the possible effects of a Korean truce,
makes the point that-

“It (a Korean peace) could be the
first step also in reopening '_a vast and
urgently needed market for the world’s
goods. -We can't expect any permanent
peace and prosperity with a great
chunk of Asia closed to’ international
trade. The free world, including Can-
ada, needs this additional outlet for its
surplus products and for fast recover-
ing Japan.‘ It offers the only real hope
of peaceful prosperity. Without /this
big natural trading area next door ex-
plosive pressures are certain to build

. up.” (June 13, 1953.)

Some company spokesmen in the non-
ferr_ous industry also now recognize
the great possibilities that peace and
expanded trade offer. Clinton H.
Crane, Chairman of the Board of St.

Joseph Lead Company, in a report to '

his stockholders on May 11, 1953, said:

“This disruption of trade (between.

the East and West in Europe) makes

business conditions on the Continent of '
Europe most difficult. The\_manufac- ‘
turing side has been separated from.

the agricultural side, and’ the cold war ~:

has placed embargoes on the ‘normal
shipments of machinery from West to
Should peace come, or even a
truce which would make the removal
of these embargoes possible, a boom
would come. such as business has -not
seen for many years.” (American
Metal Market,_ May 12, 1953.)‘ ’

From many of our European allies
come -insistent‘ demands for a relaxa-
tion of trade barriers and '/an expansion
of trade.‘ U. S. News and World Re-

_lEverywhere, Weir ‘reports, ,h'e_;found.,l_ 1, 

F  '“I am more convinced than ever that"-.3
the desire for peace is one thin'gfthat“
all‘Athe peoples of the world "hold in "

common, that it applies notonly in the

l  ' Americas and all of Europe, ‘but also in". V '

Asia. I believe this desire is building

"into demands byall peoples" that the

leaders of their government develop,

the methods to bring peace-—demands A
,_ too strong for the leaders to ignore. If A

this appraisalvis accurate,’ the possibil-

r ity’ for peace is greatly enhanced.’’.

1 Among. the conclusions, reached by

 lWeir. as a result of his trip is this -

strong belief that. “we should do our

, ’ part to negotiate withRussia.”§‘.‘This,”,
. says Weir,.“is what the Eur

‘could be less spending on defense, more
ade with the Soviet bloo——if only thc
A . S. would clack off on the ‘cold war’

Recognition of these demands open
up vast possibilities for keeping

Whereas just one year ago we were A‘

one of the few organizations that rec-
ognized the‘ need for planning for
peace, we today find leading spoken-
men for the main sections of organized
labor alert to the need for taking pol-
ltive steps to prevent a depression.

AFL for‘ public works

George Meany, AFL president, in
quoted in the New York Times as stat-
ing, “. . . that some persons did not
believe that America could maintain" a
high level of prosperity inpeacetime.
He. challenged this.--view, «however, and
asserted that the nation had not be-
gun to do what urg_ently,needed_,to be
done. . . . . .- .

“For eocample, ‘ht Asaid,‘ thousands“ of / 1' l
_ schools are needed;.hospital and medi-

cal facilities are inadequate, cities are
blighted by slum areas and outmoded
factory districts, roadways‘ have been
neglected and an acute "shortage of
low-cost housing eoci'§'ts. A Filling these
needs, he contended, would provide
American industry and labor with
plenty of work for years.

“The vital key to continuing pros-
perity, according to Mr. Meany, ie

mass purchasing power. He said the '1

only effective day toaccomplish it was
by maintaining high level employment
at high real wages.” '

CIO program

The C10 in a recent report, “Main- .

taining Prosperity,” points to the-need
for economic planningto assure full

employment in the post-truce period. '

The report ‘ calls for

The, .

One of the “target datesl? set. by the

Mining, Smelting and Refirring Con-

ference in mounting a..campaign_ against '
. unemployment was the holding of ‘area 1

hearings by the House Committee on

‘Small Business last-‘April. In seeking

a sounding board. for our union's pro-

gram, the hearings were a “natural” -

and Mine-Milllwas present and pitching
hard in every -hearing that was held——-
in Denver, Spokane,‘ San Francisco, and
Phoenix. ‘ - '

In - t h 0 s e hearings, Congressmen
heard not only from the elected leaders
of this union, but from the membership
of our local unions direetly'affected by
the lead-zinc crisis. , I - ' -

Imported metals,
In presenting the union's position to

Congress, Secretary-Treasurer Travis -

testified- that the “main reason forsthe
crisis is summed up in one word—-im-
ports. Thersmall lead-zinc operators,

 ..;._..ia.a.:ii  emit. .;f1nd

' solutions to the present lead-zinc 'crisis,,_

which will -also serve ‘to prevent w
similarpcrisis in copper. ' " 

iWe found in the House Small Busi- ‘.

ness Hearings and in the months since
then that the, great majority of lead
and zinc employers-,-_, as well as a ma-

-jority of Western congressmen and

senators, had drawn. an extremely
short-sighted and incorrect conclusion:

that since imports were apparently the ..

cause of depressed lead and zinc mar-
kets, the way to- solve the_ situation was
to stop the imports through high

I tariffs. ’ ‘

High tariffs have failedflso many
times that it is. unnecessary’ for me to,

devote. time. and space hereto expose’
the unrealistic philosophy behind them. -
Tariffs violate the very fundamentals.‘
of good neighborliness, sound economics:

andworld peace. ' And aside from any
moral objections "to high -tariffs, our
main opposition to them is*»that they

don’t ‘work. Tariffs have never solved‘
' the market problems of the non-ferrous

metals industry.- We -have had ‘them

before _ and‘ they didn’t work. They

won't work now-. ‘
o .

LIKE THE REST of,America_n in-

dustry the non-ferrous metals industry ‘

has a proble that will not be solved

bya bigger share of a- contracting mar- ‘

-.ket. ‘Rather, it can only be solved by

‘its fair; share of an_exip-anding market;

g It :was.. for -this ‘basic reason that--
Min-e—Mill expressed opposition to the

Simpson, sliding-scale taiu'ff"bill, a
measure which ‘received much support
in Congress" andkwhose chief contribu-
tionsvas to create illusions as.to its

. effectiveness, andconfusion as to-the 0

nature of the crisis’? in the industry.
As Vice-President Larson told the
House‘Small Business Committee, “a

tariff fails to recognize that the prob- I

lent is world-wide. It seeks to insulate

the domestic industry from the rest of '

the world, To the extent that a tariff

6 Several Congressmen from lead-
~ zinc states are demanding an in-
vestigation of contracts negotiated for
the purchase of foreign-produced
metals. It is up to us to follow through
to make certain that the investigation
is held and that U.S. monopoly corp-
orations assume the blame that is
theirs for their disruption of the world
markets and consequent unemployment
in the industry. ’ ‘
'1 Our campaign has added weight
to the gradi.ally increasing opin-‘
lon that restrictions on world trade will
have to be removed before any basic
solution to the industry's problem is
achieved. —

Labor must lead

There is 'a basic difference between

the fight for jobs in 1953 and the de- ‘

pression of the 30’s. Today there is an
organized labor movement, large in
size and potentially strong. Today
there are union contracts.» Today there
is some social security legislation on
the books.

Essentiall y, this means that the labor
movement must lead the unemployed
movements of today. A

The changed facts dictate-a new and
different kind of fight.

—Fll‘St of all. the organized strength
of the workers must be maintained at

V all costs.

Second, the fight for our members’
Interests must extend beyond the mere
struggle for relief. It has to enter the
field of improving and expanding all

ﬁcial security legislation so .that the -

government assumes its rightful re-
sponsibilities in protecting both em-

ployed and unemployed workers.
Third, we cannot.accep_t the premise

WE again made important gains for

our members in bargaining this year.
Our major settlements, generally val- ,

tied at over nine cents per hour in cash

and benefits, compare favorably with

those of any other unionin the U. S.
The cash value of our settlements is,-

however, a very inadequate‘ measure
of their true significance. Far more

important is the fact that through the. I
unity. and militance of our members
i we were able to win substantial gains
A ‘in an industry‘ beset by economic diffi-

culties. We shattered the phony theory
that wage increases can not be won
when, profits are falling. A ' M
The non-ferrous metals companies,
early in negotiations, made clear their

, intention of exploiting ‘the decline in
‘lead and zinc prices to_—be_at down wages ‘
in the industry. They brazenly pro- _

posed wage cuts in’ lead—zinc opera-
_tions, and with that asa wedge hoped
to impose cheap settlements in the cop-
per sections of the industry.
_ o .
THE FACT that our basic settle-

_ments thus far have been applied. to

workers were forced to accept in the
30’s that the right to a job is some-
thing contingent upon the size of a
corporat.ion’s profits.

Unemployment is not a phenomenon
which occurs as a result of some mys-
tic forces or currents. Unemployment
is created by employers who, in their
zest for-profits, fail to cooperate in
and take responsibility for any kind
of planning of the economy. ’

Employers have complained for

' years about’ government intervention
in businessgand have persisted in shout-

ing the slogan “Free enterprise pro-

vides the American way of life.” Life ‘

without employment is no way of life,
and the employers must assume respon-
sibility--for maintaining the levels of
employment.

The employers, particularly Big Bus-

piness, control the economy-—establish

price levels and determine production
levels. The cure for the ills of the un-
employed is jobs. The employers have
the responsibility for -providing those

‘jobs. That is a social responsibility-and

the people, will assess the manner in
which the employers meet that respo-n-
sibility. ' A ‘
The guaranteed annual wage is an
appropriate demand by labor to induce
the employers to meet their responsi-
bilities in respect to full employment.
High wages and full employment are
prerequisites for a stable economy.‘

THE NEW SITUATION means that
we can fight for jobs with the strength
of our organization. We can fight to
maintain all our rights‘, guaranteed
under the union contract. A_nd—we ca.n
fight for legislation and higher wages

 

the main lead-zinc areas, as well as to
copper, tells of our success in counter-

’ ing the employers’ strategy. '
Behind these settlements lies a story ’

of unusual -coordination and unity
‘through all states of negotiations. In

many ways employers-this year were i
made to realize they were dealing with

an international union and hot just
with separate locals. '
This year, there were no final set.-

_ tleiiients anywhere in the industry un-
"til" the National Wage Policy Commit-

tee approved them. A
In A.S.R, we moved a lot closer to-

ward our. goal of coinpany-wide bar-
gaining. The__long maintained company '.
fiction of local bargaining suffered a P
sharp jolt when the company signed a
national, memorandum of agreegnent .
setting forth. basic terms of settlement ,
for all properties organized by us.

9 - — _ .
IN PHELPS DODGE, unity of all
locals defeated company efforts to

chisel one-eighth of a cent in El Paso ‘

from the agreement previously reached

in Arizona. When the company insist-
ed on its cheaper deal, El Paso work-—

ers shut down the operation. Arizona

locals then let the company know that -

their agreements would notbe accepted
until El ‘Paso was settled on a similar
l_iasis.‘, Within two days, P. D. capitu-

lated and agreed to a uniform pattern ’

for all its operations.

Similarly, in Kennecott, .a relatively
favorable company offer for Utah op-
erations was not accepted until settle-
ments were reached for Arizona, New
Mexico and Nevada.

_ O

IN THE ANACONDA chain, mili-
tant demonstrations by American Brass
workers in Connecticut and Buffalo not
only forced ‘substantial
from the company but materially aided

" Montana workers in securing. an- ac-
jceptable‘ settlement. Up until two days _
.-  ‘before the’ August 31 'deadline, 'Ana- .

concessions '

   
 

with our organization and strength in-
tact.

This perspective must be kept con-
stantly in front of "us if we are to
achieve any measure of success in the
fight for jobs.

Program for future

I s_trongly recommend to this conven-
tion the following program to give
even greater emphasis and attention to
the union’s4stru.ggle in this field:

I That we attempt to broaden the

lead-zinc fight to a political strug-
gle in the states in order to amend un-
employment compensation lawsso that
they provide 1) increased compensation
per week; 2)’ compensation immediately
upon layoff, without waiting periods,
and 3) full compensation for the entire
period of unemployment.

We must further broaden our

activity in the political field to
win support from all sections of the
population for our program for peace-
ful production. Essentially, this means
to carry on a struggle for public work
and projects in this country that will
create employment by creating a bigger
domestic market for the metals we pro-
duce, and it means to use our influ-
ence to mount a campaign to bring
about a radical change in foreign trade
policies in order to open up vast new
markets for non-ferrous metal pro-
ducts. A change in trade policies would
bring an overnight change in industry.

We must continue our activity in
behalf of such legislation as the
Murray Premium Price Plan (S 1539)
to stabilize the industry.
4 Where workers are already laid
off, we must increase our efforts

IN ING

overnine cents an hour, A.B.C locals
then’ notified the company that the
outcome of M ontana negotiations
would have a bearing on membership
acceptance of their offer. The company
then upped its Montana offer to meet
the prevailing industry’ pattern.

» Labor unify‘ gains 
Notable advances were also made
this year in extending labor» unity’ be-
yond our own "ranks and achieving
working relations with other unions in

M the non-ferrous industry.
S The National Anaconda Conference, '

for example, played an important role
in helping to bring about "satisfactory

settlements with that company this

year. . .
The Anaconda conference was estab-

,_lishedin May of .this year. Meeting in-

Chicago, delegates from 18‘ local un-
ions of five different affiliations agreed
upon a minimum’ program of ‘contract
demands and bargaining coordination.

- Were it not for the existence of this
company—wide council, representing 80
percent of all Anaconda workers in the
U. S., the company this year might
have succeeded in imposing its five
cent “pattern” on Anaconda workers.
. 6 _

AT MUSKEGON, Michigan; Keno-
sha,- Wisconsin, and several other oper-
ations, working closely with Mine-Mill,
A.F.L. locals rtfused -to accept a five
cent increase from the company despite
its previous acceptance by a UAW lo-
cal in Detroit. This kind of united ac-
tion finally persuaded the company
4'l'.l‘lat'l"l3 would have to raise its offer
and helped substantially in bringing
about the nine cent _settlement which,
it is expected, will. be extended to all
other Anaconda ‘operations. «

In American ‘Zinc operations, Mine-

 Mill alsotook the initiative this year
in calling a conference of CIO and*AFL '

‘_locals«,.to considers joint strategy to
break through the company’s refusal

' ‘ to”-grant wage increases.

 
 

tories as the surplus foods allotment to
Grant County, New Mexico, should be
used as precedents for further conces-
sions there and elsewhere. a

Local unions should demand that

congressmen and senators at home
during the congressional recess shall

come to the communities‘ to get the ‘

full story of what even the employers
have called a depression, and that local _
union demands on their congressional-
representatives shall be made at that

time. These localimeetings can‘becomo .- 

broad community affairs involving '
other labor unions and civic groups.
We must concentrate, too, on de-
mands on governors and their

state administration for eniei'gencyw,_3l’_
public works, such as roads,‘hospita.ls,’ 
sanitation projects and others in order , '

to provide jobs. Special attention
should be given to the governors’ con-

ference which will meet in New Mexico ' '

in November.

/ '1 We must continue our support of ,
such broad struggles as that to --

prevent the mutilation of the Snake
river canyon in Idaho and Oregon and

to build" sucli_'publi'c projects asthe big A

Hell’; Canyon dam. ‘ ' _
A In the section on;-,po1itica1 action
and legislation, - I v deal .more fully

with these questions, but it. is import-
ant here to recognize: that the fight for
jobs is a political fight that demands
our fullest concentration on political

organization for 1954. A government‘

representing Big Business will not
solve our p1'obleins. It is imperative, if
we are to prevent the horrors of de-
pression from being borne solely by the
people, that we take concrete steps now

  ; Qfher settlements
' A .iOur bargaining gains last year were
 not confined solely to the major non-

farg a tribute to our militant member-
ship in that area. In the face of great
odds, they succeeded in overcoming the
bitter after-effects of the abortive

A Steelworkers" raid, in moving unitedly
‘with the restof the International.

American Brass’

‘j 4 I . While settlements were being made
in Idaho; American Brass workers, feds
,- -up with the company's refusal to budge

from their nickel offer, declared a se-
ries of work holidays. On the last work-
ing day before the "strike deadline,
American Brass, after. a gradualre-
-ztrieat, finally agreed to‘ a‘ total pack-

7 '-age worth over nine ‘cents an hour."

The package included_a 71/é-cent-im
crease, an additional five cents "an hour
for skilledlworkers, one additional holi-
day to a total’ of seven, additional

‘ gains for continuance shift workers,
and increased hospital benefits for
workers and their dependents.

, Anaconda ‘

These developments throughout the
International, just prior to the strike
deadline, added great weight ,to the
’last minute efforts of Anaconda work-
ers in Montana to get a more adequate
settlement there.

The company, until just before
the strike deadline, stubbornly held to
its position that the most. it could of-
fxeri was a five-cent—increase‘and about
a cent’s worth of fringe benefits. After
the Coeur d’Alene séttlement, and faced
with a warning from our brass locals
that-the outcome of Montana negotia-

 tions, “would have a bearing” on ac-
ceptance of the brass offer, the com-
pany finally raised its offer.

The final settlement there included
a 7%-cent-increase, liberalized hospital
andvacation clauses, and reduction of
employee-hospitalization contributions.
In addition, the company agreed to an
increase in contract mining rates.

_ By August 31, the strike deadline,
settlements were concluded in all of the

main.sections of the non-ferrous in-’

dustry. There still remained the job
of applying the Anaconda settlement

«to the_smaller properties at Tooele,.
 Utah; Conda, Idaho; and Darwin, Cali-

fornia. Also settlements had not yet
been reached with American Zinc at
East St. Louis, Ill., or with New Jer-
sey Zinc at Gilman, Colo- '

Gilman strike

Wherever there appeared the possi-
’bility of peaceful settlement, the strike
deadline was postponed and further
negotiations were undertaken. At Gil-

man, however, where the arrogant, bit--

-terly hostile New Jersey Zinc Company
had not offered one cent, our members
had no alternative, but tovstrike.

New Jersey Zinc is the same com-

pany that was engaged in the long and
bitter strikewith us at Bayard, New
_Mexico. It now seems determined to

add another chapter to its notoriously ,
anti-labor record. This is the second ’

‘continuous year in which ithas refused

. to ‘grant-any wage increase at all,, de--
spite the fact that two such increases‘
have been granted at nearby. opera-
tions in the area. V 

We know that any inferior ,se‘ttl’e'- A

anywhere else, this year will only ‘re-“

 rest of us next year and in the future.

_ Mining A

Once again, potash workers in Carls-
bad, New Mexico, were forced to suf-
fer a delay in contract negotiations as
the resultof raids by other unions.
When, after the customary red tape
involyed in Labor Board proceedings
and elections, they werefinally able to
start serious ‘bargaining, they made
real gains inspite of the labor disunity
that now prevails in~th‘e basin. e 

Probably the most important ‘ad-
vance was elimination ,of the escalator
clause by which wage changes had
been tied to changes in the B.L.S. cost-
of-living index. All previous increases
granted under the clause were frozen
into the-base rates. In addition, a gen-
eral wage increase of four cents an
hour was won. and numerous "classifica-
tion adjustments, ranging from 5 to
17 cents an hour. Basic ratesin Carls-
bad for miners, motormen and various
machine operations now are $16.56 ’a.
day, plus'20% overall bonus.-

Other gains at Carlsbad included lib-

eralization of insurance and pension‘

benefits.

At Valley Dolomite in Bonne Terre,
Missouri, :1 12—cent- general increase,
plus tonnage bonuses, were w_on.in May
of this year. 7

In the Chicago area, several fabri-'

eating and die—casting settlements
made near the end of last year and
early this year, provided for a 10-cent
general increase and other benefits.
These settlements included Chicago
Foundry, Wilson Hardware, Die Cast-
ers Inc_., Paragon Die Casting, and
Stewart Die Casting. At»-these latter
two plants, an additional five,cents,
made effective in, July of this year,
was also agreed upon. During the past

Naco

The Naco Fertilizer Co. in South
Carolina is the first company under
contract with Mine-Mill in the South
that has attempted to cut wages. They
put a 10 cent an hour cut into effect

I August"'15, and tile workers there,

members of Local 863, have been on
strike since. The situation is, important
because of the many fertilizer and
phosphate agreements held by this
union_in the South.

- I Future demands‘.
Winning higher wages and better

-conditions for our membersxis, as .we

know, not just a_ matter that occupies
us for a few months each year. Long
before our bargaining committees sit
down across the table from the em-
ployers, much thought and "prepara-

tion must go into‘consideration of what .

our members need, what demands
should be presented, what arguments

can be mustered, how best ‘to gain “

support from. our friends and neigh-
bors in the community, and numerous.

"other matters‘ connected with the «whole

bargaining process.

Even now, while many loose ends of “
this year's bargaining are yet_ to be"
tied together, we should seriously con‘-
sider those issues and problems which
are bound to assume growing impor-
tance in next year's bargaining. The
following seven points, I believe, should.
serve as a« basis for our future'bar-
gaining and I strongly recommend,
them for the consideration of the con-
vention. '

. A 4 _. -

1. HIGHER WAGES: Our analysis
of the economic situation indicaftes that
we will probably be heading for stormy
weather‘unless, of course, labor,,and
the ‘rest of the people can bring about-
sharp changes in the whole trend of

’ »' really i'dughLtimes'unless‘ they can win ,

still higher wage rates. Despite recent

gains, our living standards are-.’due..for—’

sharp declines under‘, the combined

pressure‘ of shorter work schedules,“ ‘

high prices and high .taX,es. ,
Higher wages will probably be need-

ed more than ever-Leven though they

are going to be a lot tougher to get. ,_

The cost of living shows no sign" of
letting up. For“ the past five months
even the inadequate Bureau of Labor
Statistics index has been moving
steadily upward. Even if prices should

start to.decline, we know from past ex- 4
periences that they never fell as- fast’.

as reducedearnings of workers.

On the ~_bas-is of productivity" in-
creases alone in recent" years, our"
members" are entitled to a far. greater

share of what they produce than what "

they have gained in wage increases.

-2." ‘SIX-HOUR, DAY: The trend. of
events within our industry isforcing.
the issue~of a shorter work week with-
out loss of pay to the forefront of
bargaining demands. -_- _ .

With growing unemployment because"
of depressed markets and vastly in-
creased, productivity, more and more
of our members are being forced out
of the industry.

., Shorter hours,% ‘current take-home I,
pay will- help. cushion the ‘disastrous A

effects of cut-backsand shutdowns ‘and
will helpto maintain purchasing power
without compelling workers to “share-
the‘-poverty,” as was practiced during
the last depression. , '

* Shorter:-lfours will reduce accidents
and injuries due to fatigue. They will

"contribute to the health and welfare. of

our 'members atﬁd enable. them to par-
ticipate more fully_in the benefits of

increasing productivity.

3. IMPROVE CONTRACT BONUS-

ES AND INCENTIVE SYSTEMS: Un-
der contract bonus and incentive sys-

‘ tems, as they now most commonly ex-

ist, employers are able to manipulate
earnings so as to deprive workers of
the full benefits of _ negotiated wage
increases. Our first Contract’ Bonus
Conference held‘ in Butte on May 26‘
and 27 of this year helped3to focusat-'
tention on the seriousness of this prob-
lem and also formulated fa constructive
program to_help remedy the situation,

tracts with delays and’.inadequate

contract. ’ , ;

f. Coverage of indirect workers. (such
as haulage and servicing workers) un-
der __ some form of incentive when -the

‘ amount of work performed by such in-
direct workers"is affected. by contract
work. V ' A A

The ‘International ,Union must. also
play a more positive role in the lead-
er,ship__and coordination ofall bargain-
ing on. the contract issue. We intend
to "pay a great deal more attention to
this entire problem. ”

4. MORE ADEQUATE PENSIONS:
Our pensionpplans, it is generally“ rec-
ognized, do not now provide sufficient
income to enable retired workers to

. live atlanywhere near an” adequate
standard‘ of living. ' i ’
. Many of these plans" will'_be ‘open
for amendment during the coming
year. Others can be reopened, as is
true of any contract provision, with
the consent’ of management. We "pro-
pose, during the coming year, to press
for improvement of all existing plans
to provide-for the following minimum
standards: ’ '_' - J

a. Bring benefits up to standards of
more recently negotiated plans‘ in
which benefits run ashigh as $135 per
month. ‘I ' 3 _ ‘ j ‘

b. Bring benefits in line. with in-
creased living costs which have gone
up. greatly since these plans were first

negotiated. ' .
c‘. Give workers -‘the benefits of re-

cent increases in Social Security bene-. .
‘fits which, in most cases, have gone _en--
tirely to employers.’ \ I .
. ' '  -9 I N
5. IMPROVED. H E A L T H AND
SAFETY: Our comprehensive review of
"existing health and welfare plans, made ’
last year,'fully established that these
plans do not adequately meet the health
needs‘ of our membersand their fam-
ilies. Such improvements in health and
welfare plans‘ as were made in this
year-’s ‘bargaining were extremely lim-
ited and were far" slfort of meeting
real ‘needs. .
We propose to push more resolutely
in coming negotiations for acceptance

'. Wherever contract bonus systems —are 
‘in effect, bargaining demands cover-
6' ' , ,

government policy.
Our members will be in for some

fthéme that much more determined ‘

THE PROMISE of unity in the labor
movement tday is at its highest peak
in more than 15 years.

There has been more talk of labor
unity; merger and “no-raiding” pacts
in the last six months than in all the
years since CIO was bornlizn the mid-
Thirties. As far as the hope of real

’ unity in the labor movement is. con-

cerned, the whole situation . has
changed drasticaIly—in favor of unity
-—from what .it was inst a year ago.

This new surge toward unity has

been brought on by a number of de- \

velopments, most dramatic of which

was the election of President Eisen-

hcrwer and his Republican Administra-

tion. . at - '
O

V LABOR QUICKLY SAW that the
great corporations, ‘encouraged -by
political ‘victory, were moving in to
consolidate their profit machine in the
face of threatening depression, hoping
to divide and crush the American peo-

-ple and '—their__ organizations, especially '

their unions. White House doors,
which ‘once were open to AFL and
CIO‘ officials, now were slammed in

their faces. The corporation attack on

and labor’s~ gains
frank,

‘workers’ rights
suddenly became
piti less.

When we met. in Convention just a
year ago, I reported that: “Happily
there were a few,,fledgling indications
that at least some sections of the labor
movement recognized the dangers in
the new united front offensive-of the
employefs. With that recognition came
the first moves in several years ‘to
even
though the .r_noves“were hesitant, falter-
ing and scattered.”

' Doors unlocked .
Since then the drive toward unity

,.

'has "picked up a lot of speed. Many

doors that a year ago were closed and
bolted h_ave"now been unlocked and

thrown open. .Where a year ago unity"
talk was restricted" pretty much‘ to a.

handful’ of unions,’ most of. them out-

side the great’federations,, now it is”

going on in all unions——C10, AFL and
Both the giant and smaller independ-
Qnts. Millions of American workers,
who a year -ago wanted labor unity
but considered it’ hopeless,‘ are being-

-fired with the conviction that it can

happen, after all. , -

The unity talk\ has already shown
some good results.

One of the first results’ of Eisen-
howers’ arrival in the. White House was

"the renewal of unity discussions be- _
. tween the AFL and CIO. Regardless I
-— of how they themselves felt about it,

both George Meany who took the late
William. Green's place as AFL Presi-

' dent and Walter Reuther who took the-
’ late Philip Mu:-ray.’s place as CIO Pres- .
.ident knew they were faced with an
" open -campaign to smash both federa-

tions. H i —
‘ O " .

open and

. tMPofrrANr, they
were feeling a ‘7 tremendous A pressure;

campaign, in ‘cooperation with the local

 medical profession to improve "such

facilities.

In addition to these contract de-
mands, much more intensive efforts
will also have to be undertaken by all
locals and the International to improve
existing compensation,‘ occupational
disease and safety inspection laws, and
to work for the development of full
time qualified health departments in
-all mining -and smelting communities.

from the rank-and-file of their affili-
ated unions for action ‘to re-establish
organic unity in tht,r‘labor'movement.
As‘ Reuther con}mented,. the rank-and-
file of both federations have wanted
unity because  is they who have “paid
the price of disun_ity.’_’ Theldiscussions
took on a tone entirely different from
those that have beenlcarried on for
years the moment Meany said -there
would be “discussions among equals,”

and indicated therenwould be no more

of the benign nonsense about CIO
“coming back to the House of Labor."

So while the unity talks which took _
place in the last eight-months were still '

shot through‘ with -the‘ old power poli-
tics and jockeying for position, at least
they began to move. , —

‘No raiding‘ agreement

‘The AIj‘L—CIO negotiations have al-
ready produced something that marks
a kind ,of milestone———a “no raiding”
agreement. \-~, ‘ "

This pact is intended to call a halt on

January 1 to raiding which has been-
J going on for years between affiliates

of the‘two labor federations. The agree-
ment was made because leadérs of both

federations came to a conclusion that A

l'ias_ been obvious to us- in Mine-Mill for
a long time, namely that nobody ex-
cept the employer gains from raiding.

The joint committee ‘which. -worked
out! the no-raid pact came up- with
some significant figures, which it had
courage enough to publish. They show
-that in the last two years, U. S. unions
. have engaged in some 2,400 raids, about
half of which went far enough to re-
’ quire NLRB representation elections.

A total of 336,470 workers were in-
volved in the raids, 704 of which were
carried on 'by CIO unions, and 542 by
AFL unions. When the results were
added up", CIO had’ suffered a -net loss

of 8,373 W0l'kel‘s, and the AFL had‘

i made a net gain of 4:972 workers-—-a't

. a cost of $1,000 per worker for “organ-. _
izing.’.’ Another 3,138 had’ dropped ,out _

"of unionism completely on “no union”
votes- ._ k » r
‘ 0

WHAT THESE FIGURES show, or?

’ course, is? that raiding doesn’t pay—no’
matter who the raider is. _
‘But the AFL-CIO raiding agreement
can be a step toward‘ something "more
than a mere truce to halt jurisdictional
marauding. The'1ogica1 next step can

' be seen by what happened '/after -the

CIO'Auto Workers and the ;AFL Ma-

‘ '&inists V had ‘wo-rk_e_d ‘together. under,__a

‘frfo-raid” agreementvfor several years.

  UN ITY.

inghouse Workers had begun discus-
sions aimed at a “no-raiding” agree-
ment this spring, it wasn’t long before
they found . themselves talking about
joint bargaining. The logic was simple.
Both these unions have,,contracts with
the big packing chains—Cudahy, Ar-_
mour, Swift, Wilson. If they throw
their combined weight against the em-

ployers in joint bargaining, the work- ‘

ers in both unions are tremendously
strengthened. I

To show they meant busiifess, lead-I

ers of the two meat packing unions
signed a “memorandum of understand-
ing,”‘which put the issues very plainly.
They._said their agreement was “im-
pelled by the events of the day which

make clear that the attacks of reaction

on the American labor movement are -

‘ growing and will continue to grow in
intensity.” And they went on:

“Both “organizations recognize thzit
the real solution to the problems ‘of
the American worker rests, in the-eyen-
tiial unity of all labor organizations
in "one federation. It is our hope and
desire that such ‘objectives can be real-
ized, and to that end we will continue
our efforts to achieve organic unity

of all workers within the jurisdiction».
of our two organizations and‘ the labor.-

movement as a whole.

_“The pressu1'e of the present needs
of the workers‘ in our industry re-
quires, however, that the unions in this
field immediately establish machinery

/for cooperative action which cannot

await achievement of the ultimate ob-
sjective of complete unity."

C These very facts of,internal: unity
despite differences of opinion suggest a

4 very important principle on which we
.must carry the fight for unity to mem-

bers of otherunions. The principle is

that if there is room for differences of-
.opinion within our Union, there is also

room‘ for differences of opinion within
a united labor movement.

‘This was the rock of principle on
which the CIO foundered when it made

, up its mind to split the labor movement

IFWE LOOK backlto the early years

n

ISSUE--a common-

The t_hird.i'mportant less Jnithat we’ve

. drawn from our own -history isjthat we

are heartily in favor of unity for all '
labor'—-—AFL, CIOrand independent. The

timeis more than ripe‘ fora united de- ‘

fense of our common welfare. .Now
more than ever the workers of America
——_all workers——stand_ to win by ‘fighting
together’ against the united corpora-~'
tions.  " '  '

We believe that any unityideal-. be- M’

tween the AFL»and CIO that leaves out
the independents’ such as_Mine-Mill, the
United’ Electrical, Radio 452. Machine
Workers and the Int’l Longshoremen’s
& Warehousemen’s Union‘ .,is not a

,genuine, meaningful un-ity of labor.

Onereason is that if we are excluded,
it will mean simply a reshuffling of
the labor deckiby the ‘top. pie-cards for
the purpose of maintaining themselves.
This in turn will be based merely on

~the.unity of conformity, which is a sign‘
of weakness, not. strengt ' '

time, it is important for us to see that

for example, that the TC1 "Mine-Mill 

locals would go out of business, and the
workers who still belong to the,m would
become active, dues-paying members

We cannot. be inthe ‘position of urg-' W

not. And I believe this Convention must
take every .action possible to demon-

made its \greatest adva_nces in history
during a period when the simple idea

of unity-despite-differences was'whole-‘

heartedly acceptedrby all groups in C10

from‘ top -to bottom.

Let’s recall at this point, too, that 

wasn’t'Mine-Mill which dis-united_ the
labor movenfent in 1950. We fought a
last-ditch battle to maintainvunity with-
in C10, and our chief battle-cry was the
right of every union in CIO not merely
to have an opinion but to express and
advocate that opinion. -‘ ’

We all knew that ‘we could easily

have remained within CI‘O—-if we were

prepare,d_to_ abandon our righ_t ,to_ have
an opinion and the democratic"right of

which they thought was in their own

ingless if that was the price which had '
to be paid for it. And We were right,

of course.  "

Unity in our industry

The second important lesson that we
have learned after 60 years of fighting
unionismis that we need unity among
all theworkers in ourindustry. When

_ we say that, we_do NOT mean that all

the workers in the industry must be-
long-. to our union. Nor, on the other
hand, do we mean that Mine-Mill
should be handedover to some other

_union that holds contracts with the

same employers.

V What’ we DO means is that w_e be--
lieve all the unions in thisiiudustry can. \ -

get together in common action to, de-

feat’ the strategy of the employers

which hopes ‘to keep our ranks divided.-‘
While“ Mine‘-Mill is‘ easily the’ union

,which represents the majority of the-‘

workers _.in our industry, there are at
least 10 other unionsfwhich hold con-
tracts with sonie__of the same employers

aswe do. Thenon-ferrous corporations.

be noticed in the reading of

-' this report that -there is considerable

content that can only’ be characterized
as “political.” It would have been im-

possible to discuss almost any issue’

‘ without examining its political aspects.

Collective bargaining is politics in
-this day and age. Certainly labor’s
rights are, too. And civil rights,
minority rights, hydro-electric power,
:the truce in Korea, unemployment,
‘strikes . and lockouts,’ public .works,
world trade, silicosis, and labor uﬁity—
all of these are “politics” and all re-
quire “political action” if the interests
of our members are to be protected
and advanced. “

The National Association of Manu-

facturers and the employer-control»led “

press have tried to make “political
action” something out-of-bounds for
Americans.‘ That‘ is because “political”
action” is the“highest expression of the
people’s ability to fight back. It was
the guts‘ of the people’s support of
Franklin D. Roosevelt. It will be the
heart of the people’s counterattack
against what _Senator Morse calls the‘

l.“Cadillac Crusade” in Washington.

T . Q J .
POLITICAL ACTION -in 1953 and
1954 poses two specific tactics result-
ing from geographic and organizational
considerations. , I
Populations are sparser in the West,
eiihaiiciiigilie political strength and in-
fluence of any organized group.
In the larger industrial centers of

‘the Middle-West, East, and Deep South,
with their greater density of. popula-

I tion, even a large local union has only

limited . political strength-unless--and
this is most important,wunless that local

, union can develop a general political
movement among ALL labor unions in

the area. V
Community action

The politicalinfluence of our local
unions in such areas as Connectic_ut’s
Brass Valley and Vermillion _County,
Illinois, is an example of how, even

though Mine-Mill is not the “majority” 

‘union in the area, we can exert political;

‘w strength far beyond our membership.

Standing alone, we wouldn’t mean
much, but working in‘ unison with
other workers we are an important
political force. , V

In. the Western states, our member-

- ship constitutes a larger percentage of

‘the total population. In the mining and
smelter towns, in ‘fact, our members
and their families are a majority of
the population. It is in these areas, that

‘ Mine-Mill LEADS the struggle for _a

people’s coalition against the million-
aires who have captured the Eisenhow-
er administration.

East, or West, themain ingredient

, of political success for our union lies

in our ability to work together with
other people’s forces,~particularly other

» labor unions, in the various communi-

ties in which we have members.

New ‘Deal advance

Out of the mi_sery and suffering of
the depiessioii in the 30’s, the metal
miners of the West rebuilt their union,
the small farmers banded together to
protect their small holdings. United
under the banner of the New Deal,
these and other people’s forces won

legislation that stemmed momentarily‘

the~drive of Eastern capital (the min-
ing companies, railroads, etc.) to con-
solidate its hold over t.he__we‘alth of the
region.’ ' ' " _ '

With the end of World War II and
the advent of Truman, however, East-
ern capital and special-interest’ blocs in
the West loosed 'a profit orgy _that has
provcn a stunning blow to the people.

With the election of Eisenhower, the
mining companies, the power compa-
nies, the railroads, and other Big Busi-
ness elements took off the wraps.’The_v
got Douglas McKay named Secretary
of the Interior and Ezra Benson Secre-
tary of Agriculture. Both are appropri-
ate additions to the “millionaire cabi-
net.” I , '

_ t . .

BIG BUSINESS, or “corporate en-
terprise.” launched the Big Steal. Nat-

ural resources have become fair game»
for Wall Street swindlers. Hydro—elec_- ‘

ti-fc power, "public grazing lands,‘na-
tional forests,‘ natural gas and mineral

rights-——one after another they’§re the

stake in an econoinic_ crap game in

‘which ‘Big Business supplies. the dice

and the people supply thewealth.

The cold"war hysteria had’,its—inipact _'

in other ways, too. The mining compa-

nies accelerated their program of red- '

baiting and division against the miner’s

union—tlie Mine‘, "Mill and Smelter

Workiers.

b With the capture of the Democratic
party, by the- most conservative ele-
ments, effective‘ opposition to Big
Business’. drive against the people of
the West was greatly weakened. The
old- coalition of workers, farmers, and
small business men became disunited
and disillusioned during the Truman ad-
ministration. Reactionaries within the
Democratic ranks turned’ their party
into an ally of_ the Republican party.
They simply refused to fight. .The
consequent resultspwere heartbreakin'g.

Thomas of Utahweiit down in defeat.

» “'Re_acl-ionary ‘trend 1

The --trend was even truer in the
House.
New Deal variety lost out in the pri-
maries to‘ reactionary Democrats or to
their Republican opponents in the final

‘elections. .

So the Western stronghold of pro- ‘

gressivism was divided in 1952: The
Republicans had demagogically and
successfully pinned the label of ,“war
party” on the Democrats and the peo-
ple were_fed up with the casualties and
hopelessness of the Korean war. Pledg-

R

ing to end the war, Eisenhower carried
every Mountain West state. and here
is what happened in the Congressional
and Senate elections:

New Mexico—John Dempsey and the
extreme conservative Antonio Fer-
nandez, won re-electioiis, although seri-
ously challenged by Republican oppon-
ents. Senator Dennis Chavez was re-

elected, but this victory is being chal- _

lenged by the "Republican-controlled
Senate at this inonient. ,
. ‘ O ’
Arizona—-A"long-time’ New Deal lib
m-al, Rép.-John Murdock, was defeated
- by a young Republican, John J. Rhodes,
who was backed by Pew oil money and
..w1;o played upon the Korean casualties
to win votes. ' ‘

The other Arizona Congressman,
Harold A". Patten, was re-elected; he
had not offended the special interests
in his state. I-nthe Senate, Ernest W.
McFarland, Democratic majority leader,
was de'l"eat_ed by Barry Goldwater, de-
partment store: magnate and witch-
hunter.

Utah—-Tlie entire Congressional dele-
« gation went Republican. Senator Wal-
lace F. Bennett had’ wonhis seat in
1950. Senator Arthur V. Watkins, arch-
J.'eactioiia1'y pal of Kennecott Copper
and Pat McCarran, easily defeated the
liberal Walter. D. Granger, former Con-
gi-essman,. who had challenged him.
Reva, Beck Bosone,-liberal Democrat,
was defeated. Utah’s House delegation
is now made up of two arch-reaction-
ary, anti-labor Congressmen: William

fellow. ' '

thousands and thousands of jobs. With
Secretarycofv the Interior McKay direct-

A ing the cast, the Eisenhower admini-

stration betrayed the people and

i turned ‘Hollis Canyon over.to a Maine
corporation, the Idaho Power Company.

THE PEOPLE of Idaho, Washington,
and Oregon rallied quickly and angrily.
Farmers, cattle ranchers, small busi-
nessmen, public power advocates, and
united labor went into action and ex-
panded the Idaho-Oregon Hell’s Canyon
association into a national organiza-

T tion embracing-Mine-Mill and other la-
f= bor unions, and a bro_ad‘cross-section
«of people’s..org_anizations in the North-

west. I am proud to have been selected
a member of the executive committee
of the new organization. '

The impact of this new pople’s move-
ment in the Northwest ‘has greatly en-
hanced the political ptisition of such
Hell’s Canyon dam proponents as Con-
gresswoman‘ Pfost of Idaho and Sena-
tor Wayne Morse of Oregdn. Con-'
versely, such opponents of Hell’s Can-
yon at Senator Dworshak of Idaho will

. face the fight. of their lives when they

come up for re-election.

_ ‘The lead-zinc crisis, discussed else- '
where in my report, was another issue

which has',become a political hot potato.
And M__i_ne-Mill made it-so. ‘ .

Outlook for J 954

— ,' Without examining all of the issues

in the various .stat_es, I would like.to
deal briefly here with’ the political pic-

'ture in the Mountain West as it con-
cerns the.1954 elections. And I would
‘emphasize here _tliat ,the outcome of
‘Rocky Mountain elections will have
" crucial effect on national politics. Our
-members in District 6 have almost as
‘much at stake in them as our ~Western

I members.‘ _ 

Idaho

As I _have pointed out, Senator Dwor-

I shak comes up for re-election in Idaho

‘ _“ in 1954. His record is one of ‘extreme

:reaction, one .of the poorest in the "

U.S. Senate. It can be said here that

‘unless Dworshak drastically improves

his voting record, he will have to be

I replaced. At the moment, no Democrat

' or Republican of sufficient stature has

announced his candidacy against Dwor-
shak. The Idaho senatorial race will
be one of the most important facing
this Union in 1954.

Monfanq  I -

I Senator James M_urray of Montana is
up for re-election in 1954 and de-
serves our support. The reaction:

‘V ary forces of the state are almost

‘ certain to '-try to unseat Murray, at-‘

tempting to do the same kind of job on

' him as the McCarthyites did on Millard

Tydings in Maryland. The Murray race
will be a national‘ issue. Mine—Mill
forces in Montana have a major job
cut out for them in the developing .-of

,a united labor-small farmergprogressive

A . support for one ofthe outstacndingi men

in Congress.  . ‘ . - m.
‘ Also up for election will‘ be the two

. "Montana seats of the House of Repre-

‘.’/

sentatives. The._y,oun'g liberal ;Metcalfe ,_
I has played a cautious role in his "fresh- _‘
_;_man’A’-V ‘_y,ear,n<but -‘generally his record ~

'\

_sion of the

‘thus far is one we can support. Per-

haps ‘a more energetic political role for
Montana labor will result in a bolder
approach by Metcalfe in Congress.

A major political error was commit-
ted by Rep. Wesley .d’Ewart, Montana
Republican, when he introduced legisla-

-tion at the recent session of Congress

which would turn large public grazing
lands over tovthe wealthy ranclrers._ A
fighting Democratic campaign could
result in ‘the unseating of this special-
intercst Congressman.‘

Utah _

A radical change in the Utah political
picture is needed if two . reactionary
Congressmen there, Dawson and
Stringfellow, are to ' be unseated. A
united political program by all labor
un_ions in‘ the state, in alliance with the
small farmers and smaller merchants,
could stiffen or change the Democratic

I party leadership there and iresultrin a

decisive -challenge of the Republican
stranglehold.

That such labor unity is possible and
productive was proven‘ in the last ses-
Utah legislature when
Mine—Mill, - CIO, AFL, and railroad
unions united to ‘fight a phoney “right
to work” bill’ and defeated it.

Nevada

The governorship land .the seat ;.of
congressman—at-large are both open in
Nevada. The beginnings of labor unity
achieved in the 1952 ‘elections have to
be nurtured and expanded in‘ this Mc-
Carran empire if we are to make any

headway at Aallvagainst the com‘binat.-ion

of gangsters and Big"Bus'iness,which'

controls the agingwsenator and his
state. -, ‘ ‘

That__..McCarran ‘is \panicky' can a be i
‘ seen from-the fact that he had,‘ his‘ .»
’ pocket legisl_ature_ vote an amendment

to the Nevada constitution to prohibit

anyone not areslident of the *st‘ate—for_‘

five years from seeking pu'blic_ office.
The =»amendment has been generally

Arizona has no senatorial election iii

1954, but the two congressional seats
are on the line. Every effort must be

‘made to defeat Congressman Rhodes, ._n

the co-author of the viciously anti-
union Goldwater-Rhodes bill. Oneof
the paramount needs, politically, in
Arizona is labor unity. Such unity can
spark a fight to clean the reactionaries
from control of the Democratic party

In New Mexico, theyfight must con-
tinue to prevent [the Republicans, from
stealing Senator Chavez’ seat. In addi-
tion, a. key Senatorial election comes in
1954 in New Mexico when Senator Clin-
ton Anderson will be up for re—election.
Anderson has a good record for fight-
ing against the tidelands oil theft and
against cloture, butllabor, the ‘small
farmers, Mexican - American organiza-
tion and- others will have to convince
the§enator that a fighting,_progre‘ssive
program is the_ only way to get re-
elected. There is some indication that
Anderson’s opponent will be Governor
Edwin Meechem. . ' '

No definitive remarks on the —two
Congressional races can be made at

Rapidly becoming the key politica

‘ issue in -New'Mexico is the unemploy-

ment situation in the lead-zinc mines.

THE l\'IAJQR organizational concen-
tration, however has been in Southern
Arizona and the uraniumiproperties in
Northern -’ Saskatchewan. ; Shortly after

__ the last convention, acting upon the‘

. organizational policy statement adopted
by the convention, the International
Executive Board undertook to develop
an ‘organizing. program based -on con-
centration. This ‘program called for
. concentrated organizing activity on the
San.Manuel property near Tucson and
some other mines in that vicinity, in-
" cludingthe‘ Sam Knight, the A.S.&R.
property ‘called’ the Silver Bell, the
Banner Mining Company. the Coronado
' Copper and Zinc Company» .Ma‘gma
Copper at" Superior, Arizona, and some

sm’a1ler_properties. in the same area.
-The second -point of concentration
was the "uranium min‘es..in Northern
Saskatchewan. A third point of "con-
centration was the big new copper op-
eration at White Pine, Michigan.’ o
In addition, it was decided, as part

 of the ,“win' back” program, to try to

develop campaigns at Ducktown, Ten-
nessee, and St. Joe Lead. In the case
of both Ducktowngand: St. _Joe Lead, it

.,became apparent, after considerable
experience in these campaigns, that
more and more workers are inclined
today to resist any change inthe bar-
gaining agency, whether it be by~-a
raiding union or by the union which
was originally‘ raided. A

Therefore, in vlinexvith this policy,

are’ having considerable success.‘ In

Our departments have been welded
into 'a' highly effective organization for
carrying out the decisions of the union
and meeting the requirements of our
membership. Countless examples of
the close teamwork‘ between depart-

course, was the work of our field staff‘
in the affected areas.V Our Interna-
tional representatives produced the
leaflets, helped organize delegations,
secured petitions," made approaches‘to
other. union leaders and mobilized our

membership in this all-out undertaking.’ I

The lead-zinc campaign is but one
of many examples of the closely inter-
related work of our staff.

' THE UNION is the consistent voice
of our organization. We constantly
strive to make improvements in it.‘ We
devote more attention tothe paper, its

tain extent, we did not appreciate the
importance of “A World At Peace.”
Had we accorded it the attention it
deserved, wewould have begun prepa-
rations to.meet the shutdowns find lay-
offs in ‘lead and zinc several: months
before the impact of the crisis hit us.
Nevertheless, the “World At Peace”
program served as the basis in subse-
uent months for our activity for jobs

' .1 I ‘\.M.ill’s ‘program to relieve the situa-

that THE UNION was not being'1_'ead
by a/large section of . our Mexic‘an-’
American membership‘ because of the
language difficulty. Attempts to solve
this problem in the past consisted of
occasional articles translated in Span-
ish. This sporadic ,effort failed to meet
the important need of building a reg-
ular group of readers among our Mex-
ican-American brothers. OurNew York
convention recommended that steps be
taken to, assure a Spanish page in‘
every issue of THE UNION.

Shortly after' the convention, this
new featur_e— was instituted in our
paper. ‘This long-needed addition has‘

had an enthusiastic re_sponse~"among,‘

our Mexican-American ijiembership. It
should be pointed out that the Spanish
page is more than a mere literal trans-
lation of some -of the English articles
appearing. in the paper.

ican-American community.‘ ,

We learned during. the‘ year that
THE UNION was bursting its- seams

it was ‘impossible to compress the es-
sential facts on the life of the union

‘ “laslnington Office

The wisdom of our decision to re-
open our -Washington legislative office
is being demonstrated ‘daily. We re-
counted ‘briefly the service‘ that this
office pe1*for1ned in connection ‘with
‘the lead-zinc campaign. There‘ is hard-
ly a ‘local union in the United States
that has not availed. itself of our Wash-
ington offic-e"s services. The types of
inquiries _re.ceived are so ‘varied as to
qualify‘ it as an “Information, Please”

' ot’f.ice.' A\Legislative Newsletteris is-

sued from Washington to keep our
local unions abreast of developments
inthe nation’s capital. ‘

Our Washington representative, as
in the case ofthe lead-zinc lobby, on
numerous occasions has assisted in ar-
rangingi meetings between local union
‘representatives and Congressmen or
heads of government bureaus. He has
"provided to -'Congressmen information

But export marke'tsa’re there if trade
were freed :from politically imposed

poses the’ same restrictive bans on its
own trade and that of many other coun-
tries, with the result that surpluses

self from the consequences which flow‘

from this, the _U. S. imposes further‘
bans against imports from other coun-
tries, ,
Canada. is, of. course, especially

and dangerously exposed to these «re.-

strictions. Canadian butter, cheese
land other dairyproductsgihave been

excluded from the U. S. by. succes- _

sive steps in 2.1951 andgthiis year, and
restrictions on’ the import of ~'wheat

‘ and other grains are also planned, ‘

all in violation of International trade
treaties. ‘ i

- They .have added to. the.’ farming ’

crisis in-Canada, and caused sharp re-

in farm income, Canadian exports of

agricultural implements have fallen off
by over 20%, atthe same tim_e as im-.-
' ports from the‘ U. S. have risen sharp-

ly. All this has caused heavy unem-
ployment in the agricultural imple-
ments industry.-

THE SAME SITUATION has devel-

oped in _lead and zinc, as our members ~

know only too Well. Despiteithe drop
in 'lead and zinc prices, the closing ,.of
many -of the smaller mines. and’ wide-
spread ‘unemployment among ba_se
metal miners. in Western Canada, Ca-

and zinc are running ._substa’ntia1ly

above last year, thus contributing to ‘

the over-supply in the ‘U. S. To “deal

.. with” this situation the Simpson‘. bill

to impose a sliding scale tariff on im-
ported metals was proposegd in Con-‘

"gress. Such a tariff would force al-_,

most every Canadian lead, -and ~zinc
mine to‘ close down. ’ i

The FinanciaLPost, organ of Cana-
dian‘”big business, commented angrilyt‘

“Some of thesepro*tectio1tist'Con- -

' Canada’s ‘dependence, -' U. ' S. is
making Canadian "workers more and

more mere “hewers ef',wood and draw- '
ers ‘of Water” to U.» S.’ industry, with
the bulk:of the annual -output of‘ Can-. '

ada’s natural. resources going to the
U. \S., and along with it the sale of the
bii-th=Tight of the Canadian people to
these resources and their future pro-
duction.

Dumping ground
Another aspect of Canada’s depend-

ent economic position is that Canada
is made a dumping ground for-excess‘

U. S. production.‘Referencé has "been

made to the imports of agricultural.
machinery. Fresh fruits and vegetables

are another example. A flood of tex-
tile- imports has -put many thousands
of‘ Canadian textile workers out of a
job.

the nickel and copper production in
the Sudbury basin and for a steel mill
at the Lakehead based on the huge
iron ore development at Steep Rock in

‘ northern Ontario. As things now are,

Importsyof coal have been increased '

' while production‘ from Canadian mines

is going down; thousands of coal min-
ers are out of work in Nova Scotia and.
Alberta and others are on short time.

' .Many Canadianbmines have shut down
_while more than half of Canadian con--
sumption is imported from the U. S.

O
IN THE CASE-of the central prov-,
inces of Ontario and Quebec, .where
two-thirds of the Canadian people live

and an even higher proportion‘ of in-"

dustry is located, only a tiny ‘fraction
of the coal usedxisbought from Cana-
dian mines; all the rest comes from

the U.  Dependence on the U. S.~
‘makes it certain” that the Canadian
~ economy‘ and people will suffer the full -

impact of a recession in the States.

i Finally, Canada’s dependent eco-
onomic position means that her indus-
trial development is curbed.‘ Because

everything ‘comes ‘second to the needs

of war, the gindustrial development
which coul'd,'use Canadian. natural_
..resources for processing and manu-
facturing is denied. Canada ships

nadian production and exports of“l'ead  ‘ raw matenalshi “-1. 055 the border at

Canada’s production I of heavy and
durable goods is mainly at the final

_ stage of assembly of imported compo-

nents,'_the.facto1'ies being in most cases

"branch "plants of 4giantU. S. corpora-

tions. The aiitomobile industry (Ford;

Q THE" ISSUE of whether it should be

built across Canada or-‘_to the ‘U. S."
now arises ,in connection with ‘a -gas
pipeline. There'is],enough ,gas in Al-

berta to supply Canada’s "needs forthe,

next '75 years. But there is also mount-
ing, pressure from U. S. gas, companies
hoping‘ to make millions in profits fromt

' the sale of Canadianlgas, for an im-

‘mediate exportoutlet to the U. S. An

Canada imports $150 million worth a
year of coal from the U. S. and almost
as much of gas and oil.

I Wall Street's efforts to prevent con-
struction of the St. Lawrence seaway
have become almost a public scandal.‘
The seaway is vital to Canada’s devel-
opment, in terms 'of both transporta-
tion and electric power. The govern-'
ment has said _that if the U. S. refuses
to cooperate‘ in building the seaway
jointly, Canada will build it alone. But
so far no action has followed these
brave _words; they are still viraitingv
for the U. S. to “cooperate.”

CANADIAN wAREcoNoM

 .  basic economic trend in Canada

during the past year has been in ac-
cordance. with the country’s position
as a dependent‘ war economy. Under
the stimulus of war spending and the
inflow of capital from the U. S., Can-

, ada’s totalproduction of goods and

services in 1952 was about 6% greater _

than in 1951. Part of this increase was
in the form of a larger supply of con-

, .Iumer goods andservices for the peo-
. V' ple, particularly of ;tarm- products due

to the record Western grain crop. But

'the main things were the increase in

government expenditures on rearma-
ment and capital investment for war

* purposes. 1

. In 1948, $255 million were spent on
in 1949, $361 million.
These amounts were equal to about
2% Canada's total production of

income taxes, including the old age se-
curity income tax of 2% which yielded
$45 million and bears most heavily on
those with the lowest income. Income
tax payments were 32% higher in
1952 than in 1951. We also find that
the government in 1952 collected $243
million more in indirect taxes»than _in
1951, including $142 million from the
2% old _age securing sales tax. Nearly
one-half of’ the boasted increase in
wages and salaries is thus accounted

. for.

It is therefore not surprising that
the slightly larger supply of consumer
goods and services _could only be sold
by a heavy increase in consumer"credit.
Credit restrictions were lifted in May
19.52, and installment sales rose sharp-
ly in the following.months, the total
outstanding was $1.5 billion at"the end
of 1952 and is now reaching close to

‘-IT IS CLEAR that Canada’s so-called
prosperity rests onvery narrow and
shaky ground. As shown above, there
are serious difficulties in agriculture,

and there_have been cut-backs and lay- I

offs in many lines, notably fishing,
lumber,'metal mining and coal mining,
textiles, agricultural implements and
electrical goods. It must be recognized
that these things are happening now,

Faced with the —uncertainty of the

Gold’ presents »a. special problem. It

‘keeps. it far below its true value, has
three ‘main results. —

than the base metal miners did. To-*2... '

day, there are 10,000 fewer workers in
gold mining, and_ they earn much less"
than base metal workers. This drastic
change has been caused by ‘the fact_

that the prices of base metals have been A

_Canada’s gold production last year

amounted to 4,420,000 ounces——over‘
$150 million at the present price. A"
.higher price for gold would make it

possible for Canada greatly‘ to increase
gold .production, and to balance her
payments with the United States with
gold -r-ather than by capital imports by
which exploit the

U. S. imperialism.

Similarly, a higher price ‘for gold
would.ease the dollar shortage of Great
Britain and the sterling bloc and would
be an important step towards freer
international “trade, thus helping to‘
solve the trade crisis from which Can-
ada as well as other countries now
suffer. ' ’ \

only one lead-zinc smelter exists. This
permits the owners to‘ restrict produc-
tion and thereby force an upward price
trend. The Cominco smelter alone in-
creased charges by 42% in the last year.
The cry for tariffs against the importa-
tion of Canadian’ base metals to the
United States reflects not only the de-
sire to maintain high prices and prof-
its but to destroy as many of the inde-
pendent producers as possible.

Bargaining gains’

Despite all campaigns of the employ-
ers to hold the line, we did score gains.
In the copper mines toward the end
of last year, agreements were signed
for an over-all wage increase of 4%.
Despite the employers’ demands for

wage cuts and changes in working con-
ditions, we maintained them.

In the C. M. & S.'negotiations, where A

last year we achieved a 14-cent in-
crease, this year thercompany proposed
a 10-cent-an-hour cut. We raised sharp-
ly the issue of pensions to be nego-
tiable. It must be remembered that this
company established a pension plan
back in 1925 for which they claim that
they pay the whole cost. It provides for
pensions when the worker reaches the
point where his years with the company
and his age total 80 and provides 1%
of his last‘ ten years’ employment.

It is notorious that for miners and"
workers in the smelters, such a pen-
sion plan‘ is absolutely against their in-

terests. For many of the miners, their,

last ten years are their worst years.

We sought to change the pension

plan so that instead of the last ten‘

“WHETHER, following the truce in
Korea, there will be peace or not de-
pends mainly on three questions. Will
there be free elections and eventual
democratic unity in Korea, or will
Syngman Rhee, backed by the U. S.,
try to unite Korea by force? Will the
U. S. and other western powers recog-
nize China a.nd admit her to her right-
ful place in the United Nations? Will
there be a conference between 'the Big
Three, the Four, and eventually the

Big Five including China, to negotiate. ‘

on outstanding world problems?

“The first question alone shows the
difficulties which must be faced. Blair

years, it would be the best ten. Further
to protect the rights of our C. M. & S.
brothers in the Alberta Nitrogen plant
who have, actually worked under the
direction of this c<ﬂnpany- since 1941
when the‘ C. M. & S. was operating
company for the Dominion government,

, we proposed their seniorityto be ap-

plied right back to the days when they
started working and not 1947 when
the plant was -formally taken over by
Consolidated. While we reached an
agreement which embodied these prin-
ciples with the local . management,
through the services of a government
conciliation officer, the Board of Di-
rectors rejected this settlement and set
out its position’ as being unalterably

‘ 'opposed to any negotiations on’ the

pension plan. -

‘Board upheld Union position

The issue finally went to, a Concilia-
tion Board andthe Board majority up-
held the contention of the Union that
pensions é'r'é negotiable and proposed
to the company a study of the pension

' plan which is now in ‘effect with a view ' ‘

to amendmentgwhereby employees with
20 years’ service with the company
and having reached the age of 50. would

have their rights to the pension. The V

Boar also upheld the recommendations
in t first settlement and the company
to make reply within this contract year.
This is a major question. Although
it is by ne means settled, the whole
issue of pensions in Consolidated is
now up for discussion and it is estab-
lished that it is negotiable. under the

‘Liberals "called the "election

 

ONE OF THE MAIN issues in the
strike was the .company’s inhuman
speed‘-up. After the strikers’ power of
resistance had been smashed, the scab
officials appointed by Washington
signed an agreement giving in to the
company on this issue. As a result,
" e working conditions in the huge

ominion Textile Company's plants
ve become much worse than before.

e ousted officers formed the Can-,

adieu" Textile Council and are organ-
ing the'*workers to fight back.

The strike of the 600 workers lead
by UK at the Montreal Warden-King
plant‘ was broken by the same oom-

. bination of Company opposition, police

yiolence backed by the provincial
government, and raiding. The Ameri-
can owned company refused to negoti-
ate with Union, which was thereupon
decertified by the Labour . Board on
the ground that it “took orders from
the Labour Progressive Party and was
therefore not a bona fide union."

The men had" no alternative but to
strike, and they were out for 10
weeks- When the company issued a
back to work call, the CIO Steel
Workers in Quebec put out circulars
urging the men to break the strike
and go back to work. -Although Steel
had never had a member in the plant,
f(UE- was the first and only union
the men ever had) Steel claimed that
the Company had promised to sign

an agreement. with them meeting the

men's demands if they went back to

 t POLI

 main political event in the
past year was the Federal general
election on August 10th in which the
Liberal government was returned
with a" slightly reduced majority. The
issues on which the Liberals and
Tories fought the election deliberately
avoided the real problems with -which
the Canadian people are and will be
faced in the coming years.

It was widely speculated that the

summer and at the height of the va-
cation season so as to be sure to get
it over with before economic diffi-
culties were more sharply felt, par-
ticularly before the western grain
crop was harvested andfalling wheat
prices hit the western farmers. Be-
cause it did not deal with real issues,
interest in the election campaign was
extremely low.

The Liberals campaigned on their

broken the company welched on this
"promise", and Steel was also decerti-

support the back-to—work call soon
enough!

_Quebec—low wage urea

" Why are the workers in Quebec_

being attacked so viciously, with their
right" to organize being arbitrarily
denied them? First, because" Quebec

is a low wage area. In 1946, workers .

in manufacturing industry earned less
in Quebec than in any other province,
$1.32 a week less than in,Ontario right
next door. In 1952, they earned $5.36
a week" less, so that in six years "the
inequality has increased nearly five
times. Wages of 40c, 60c and 600 an
hour are being paid to tens of thou-
sands of unorganized workers in
Montreal and throughout the province.
Hours of work are also longer.

Second, U.S. ownership of natural
resources and industry in Quebec is

especially marked; this is how Duples- .

sis‘ guards‘ “provincial rights A and
autonomy?’ against the so-called “cen-

tralizers” in Ottawa! Almost all the
- companies against which the Quebec
workers have waged their long and

bitter struggles are U.S. owned.

The low wages and working condi- I

tions in Quebec are enormously profit-
able to the American monopolies‘ and
their billions of dollars of invested

ICAL DEVELOPM

. ernment.” The’ Tories promised to re-

duce taxes by $500 million and to
“eliminate waste.” The Liberals re-
{lied that it coundn’t be done. St.

aurent stated that taxes could only
be cut if the rearmament expendi-

tures were reduced and that a vote.

for the Progressive Conservatives
would be “a vote‘ to take risks with
the security of Canada." "

The Tories promised to out-
law “communist subversion and sab-
otage” by Act of Parliament and due

rocess of law. If it was done “legal-
lly,” they said, there would be no in-

fringement or loss of civil libertiesl.

This was Col. Drew’: “McCarthyism
in striped pants.” His campaign also

_included a violent and slanderous out-
burst directly against Mine-Mill.

- Tories failed "again

The election results brought about
little change in the previous standing
of the parties, and confirmed the lack

capital. They are profitable to all com-
panies which do business in Quebec,
and have made -" of _the province the
"Deep South” of Canada, a haven
for the super-exploitation of labour.

Third, these low wages and condi-
tions are a threat to the standards
achieved _by the_ workers in other
provinces. They are maintained and

useful to big business as a weapon.

to curb the demands and gains made
by labour in the rest of Canada. And
for this it isnecessary above all to
keep French-Canadian workers divided
and isolated from their English speak-
ing brothers. A constant stream of
propaganda tries to convince both

.French-Canadian .and English speak-

ing workers that their interests con-
flict with each othe_1',_ and that they
are enemies rather than essential
allies in a_ common struggle.

BUT THE WORKERS of Quebec
are learning the truth and are fight-
ing back, as the great battles which
have taken place show. '

A

And jgcently the Courts have sharp-
ly rapped the Quebec Labour Board
over the knuckles. The Quebec Super-
ior Court annulled the Board’s decer-
tification of NE at _Warden—King. The
Supreme Court of Canada likewise
ruled that the Board’s "decertification

" of the Catholic Teachers Alliance was

“null and of no effect”. The Alliance

was decertified in 1949 following 0.

of interest which had been shown

' during the campaign. Although‘ the

number of eligible voters was larger
than four years ago, the number who
actually voted was down by 600,000
compared A to the 1949 election. The

Liberals got 170 seats. of the 265, and r

48% ‘of the popular vote. The Tories
got 51 seats and 31% of the popular
vote.

The results showed the "continuing
hatred of the people for the Tories;
many people undoubtedly voted for
the Liberals so as to. make sure of
keeping the Tories out,‘ and not e.
single Tory was elected from any
mining district. -A

Thus, for the third time since the

- end of the war, the Tories failed in

their bid to get back _into power and
were hardly able even to increase

their percentage of the popular vote. .

The results showed also that one-
fifth of the people voted against the

Labor unify needed

BILL 93 and the attacks on labour
in »Quebec——these are the outstanding
examples of the offensive against
trade union and democratic rights‘ in
Canada. This offensive is an integral
part of the bosses’ offensive against
labour along the whole front, the
offensive, to force wages down and
profits up and to make the\working
people, carry the "burden of the econ-

gomic crisis.

Labor unity is the key for success
in this fight, as it is the key in the

fight for wages, jobs, security and _
_peace. ‘ .

THE CANADIAN section of the In-
_ ternational Union has continued its
"efforts in the field of labor unity‘ and
once again,’ since our last International
Convention, developments within Ca-
nadian labor lend encouragement to the
"unity program. .-
Following our unity activities during
{1952, the Canadian Congress of Labor

1 in convention of that year was for the

first time “in._danger of control by the

'  rank and file delegates.” Significantly,

too, at this convention the Steelwork-
ers’ bid‘ for executive control of the
GCL was defeated. Indications of a
weakening of controls by the top brass
» .of Steel were noted in the storm of
protest raised among the membership
of the Steel union when the Steelwork-
ers National Council laid charges

’,"“'“against one of the Steel delegates to

the Convention who opposed the Millard
clique.

_ Following the national distribution

i_ last year of a joint Mine-Mill-U.E. labor
unity pamphlet, numerous letters were
received from CCL members and TLC
"groups, as. well ‘as requests from in-
dividual branches of these labor con-

," ‘ gresses to represent them on boards

of arbitration and conciliation.

. Strike support extended by our union
to CCL, AFL and Catholic Syndicate

it  picket lines has resulted in is favorable

acknowledgement and requests for ex-
[change of contract rates etc., and has
caused a sharp realization by the rank
and file of these unions that Mine-Mill
._is a forceful and integral» part of the
» labor movement."
Local union executive elections in

workers was tremendously successful

and the ‘educational value in promoting u

labor unity was incalculable.

Some 400 delegates representing over
70,000 Canadian workers were seated at-
this conference. More than 4,000 copies
of the full report have been printed and
distributed while a condensed copy has
been prepared for national distribution,
having in mind its help to those who
will be delegates to the labor congress
conventions in Canada. ‘

We have every reason to believe that
our labor unity efforts have had very

favorable effects and as we continue

activating our program we can expect
greater and greater results.

problems affecting the Canadian mem-
bership. This. recommendation received
the support of the Convention. The
decision to establish the Council be-
camethe major item discussed at the
Canadian Conference held in Calgary,-
Alberta on March 5th, 6th and 7th.

Gbﬁects of Council

‘The by-la-vvs of the new Council
were adopted, providing that the ob-

’ jects of the Council would be:

“The Canadian Mine-Mill Council
shall have the primary purpose, as
indicated in the preamble of the Con-
stitution of the International Union,
to advance by struggle the working
class interests of wage workers em-
ployed in and around the mine_s,___mill.<.-
and smelters and allied industries -in
Canada. ' l I

“It shall provide the ergo/nizational
means to unite the members ‘of the

International Union in Canada around ,

a common program to secure their

economic, political and social i-mprove- ,

ment. It shall work to enhance the
national welfare of Mine-Mill mem-
bers and all workers. of Canada.

“It shall be the forum in which pro-
grammatic expression is given to the
legislative, political and economic aims
of our Union in Canada. It shall..be
the body in which the functions and
activity of the International Union in
Canada shall be co-ordinated and given
central leadership. ’ ‘

“Subject: to the provisions of the
International Union Constitution, the
Council‘ shall express the position of
Mine-Mill’: Canadian. membership on
such issues as Canadian Labour laws,
Canadian legislation generally, foreign

‘policy, labour union and domestic. is-

sues and all matters affecting the
welfare of members of the Interna-
tional Union and the people generally
in Canada.

‘.“The Council shall have the right.

and obligation to recommend to the
International Executive Board and to
Conventions of the International Union
such organizational ‘steps as will pro-
mote the growth and strength of the

“International Union_in Canada.

“The -Council shall diligently seek
the unity of all workers in the struggle
against oppression by the employing
class and particularly concern itself
with

the Canada.” , ‘

Council members

They provided for the ‘election-. of
eight Council members, three from

-Eastern Canada, two from the Cen-
tral. area, three from the West, and

three appointed by_ the International.

ESTABLISHMENT of the Council

-was greeted enthusiastically by the

Canadian membership. They saw it as
recognition‘ of the growth of the Union
in Canada, and a means whereby the

work in Canada could be strengthened, ‘

our effectiveness increased, while at
the same time strengthening the bonds
between the Canadian worker and the
worker in the U. S. A., on the basis-
of mutua‘I’understanding and common
needs. '

The Council’s first action immed-
iately following the Convention was
to chart a program of organization in
the Uranium fields in Northern Sas-
katchewan. A decisive step forward in
the growth of our Union. V

The Council at its meeting in. To-
ronto elected K. A. Smith as President
and M. Solski as Secretary. Here the
immediate problems facing our Union
in Canada were the crisis in lead" and
zinc and gold and the bargaining ses-
sions in the major industriesjust com-

men cin g.

Delegation to Oﬂawa A

Following the sessions of the Coun-
cil, a large delegationfrom the Coun-
cil went to Ottawa, where they inter-

> viewed Trade Minister C. D. Howe and .

Mines Minister Prudham on‘ the pro-
gram of the’ Union for lead, zinc and
gold. Also interviewed were members
of Parliament’ from ridings affected
by the metals crisis. ’

,At the Toronto Council meeting, it
was decided in view of the fact that
all the Union leadership were engaged
in critical bargaining that the appoint-
ment of a full time executive secretary
be deferred to the next Council meet-
ing. ,

Following this meeting, the Union’s
program on legislation, based on the
decisions of the March conference were
compiled, and. a program issued to the
Locals‘ for action by the Locals in the

" Federal election campaign.

ANOTHER MEETING of the Coun-
cil was held in Regina, Sasln, on July

_24th'and 25th. This site was "chosen,
the capital of the province, in view_
of the campaign to organize the uran- ‘C

ium mines in. that province. Urgent
action was taken by the Council on
such rriatters affecting the"-uranium

mine1's,'as~the attempt of the operators A

to have their mines excluded from the

'Hours» of Work Act, also attempts by

the mine owners to have the industry

removed ‘from the jurisdiction of the
province, and its favorable legislaNt.ion.i

The session of the Council was attend-
ed by the Deputy, Minister! of Labour‘
for the Province. -,i ‘ '

Other steps taken by the Council
were the approval of the proposed
amendments to the International Con-
stitution which would formally incor-
porate the by-laws of the Council into
the Constitution, and Would further
elaborate the objects and duties of the
Council. The Council endorsed the
proposals whereby the rights of the
Canadian membership to formulate
policies would be guaranteed.

Unity strengthened

It was’ recognized by the Canadian
Council that the new proposals made

by the International officers proved "

the understanding the officers had of

the rising national counsciousness of
the Canadian membership, and the
need for the‘ organizational forms by
which the Union of Canada can expand
and p_lay its proper role in the affairs
of the Nation. At thelsame time the es-
tablishment of ‘the Council, and the
provisions for the self-determination
as Canadians of the Canadian mem-
bership, in no way dissolves the his-
toric ties and unity of purpose that
bind the Canadian and American mem-
bers in thisig-reat International.

Rather it strengthens I that unity,

* and increases. the effectiveness of the

Union in its struggleagainst the metal
monopolies of Wall Street who ex-
ploit Canadian and American workers
alike. A A I

In view of the fact that-"the idea of

the Council was only brought to_ the
attention of the Union in. the Presi-
dent’s report at the 1952. International
Convention, and its operations only
date..f,rom .the Canadian Convention in
March of 1953, it is expectedthat cer-
tain weaknesses remain to be corrected.

,ALTHO,UGH the Canadian member-
ship and its leadership welcomed the

Council and what it means to the dc? 
velopment of our Union in Canada,g:
there nevertheless exists a lackof un-‘ 
derstanding as to the great] perspec- v
tives that a Canadian Council would',7§

create. There is‘__an- inclination, to treat‘

the Council as a formal and mechanical ~
body, carrying out the policies of the 
Convention, rather than live creatively 
leadership, which could give leadership“
daily to not only the Mine-Mill meme"-.-
of Carfadag K

bership but to the workers
as a whole. /

While the Council meetings’ have 
been’ effective, and many impo1'tan_t: '1
policies and actions determ'ined,;.the' 
full impetus of these meetings has not‘ 
been felt in the day 'to day activities
of our Local Unions, nor has the Coun- 
cil by continuous activity taken.xits_ ‘ ~A
proper role as one of the leadinglla-' 

bourtbodies in Canada. . ‘

It is evident that this will have toil 
be corrected in the coming months, f"
and that the decision of the Canadian f

Convention for a full ‘time executive";

‘secretary be fulfilled. The delegates to I

the Convention knew that this wo'uvld_,,

THE state of a labor union is often
in__.some measure reflectedin its finan-
‘cial status and the manner in which
the dues money of its members is
"spent. In drafting a convention re-
port, I am always impressed with the
fact that although the auditor’s bal-
ance sheet speaks of income and ex-
“‘pense,,a union, strictly speaking, has
no income. , ‘ 1
The mo_ney which resides in the union
treasury is simply an investment made
by its members, held in trust for the
use of the membership.
So‘, although in the course of normal

the other years, the average assess-
ment was $2, but in four of the years,
it ranged from $10 to $13.

President Moyer then went on to
say: “It being conceded by all that
strikes and loch‘-outs will continue to
occur whether we wish it or not, and
that support must be given to all, I
advise that this Convention carefully
consider some plan whereby a fund
may be created for that purpose.”

Well, in 1910, this Union had 203
locals, but the Secretaries’ reports of
other years tell a different story and
reflect the hardships our Union has
suffered over the course of its history.

It will also be noted from the audit

that we again finished the year in the '

black by some $50,000. In comparison
to the previous fiscal year, the gains
of any significance. in income are
shown in District 3, 2.2%; District 7,

mending to the delegates- that the
Council become constitutionally an es-
tablished body of the Union. 4

I The Canadian section of our Union
now-comprises close to thirty-thousand
members. It was noted in President
Clark's report that it is the consensus
of the Executive Board as well as the
last convention that the national inter-
ests and welfare of our Canadian mem-
bership be offered this organizational
means of expression. ‘

.-Henceforward, the Canadian Council

will be a key and essential function of

. our International Union and whatever
, expense is involved is merited and just-

ified. Already, it has been noted that

U. the functioning of this Council has re-

sulted in significant new organization
for our Union in" Canada.
‘ o

ALTHOUGH our per ‘capita income
increased only slightly during the fis-
cal year, and operating expenses in-
creased more substantially over, those

iof the previous fiscal year, we have
been ‘able to continue tobuild our re-

serves. _

At the close of the last fiscal year,
we reported a. strike fund balance‘ of
$83,548. At the close of this fiscal
year,‘ our strike fund balance was

j$1'20,303. At the close of the last fis-

cal year, we reported a balance in the
Contingency. fundnof $77,938. At the
close of this fiscal year, the balance in
the,_Co_ntingency fund is $124,903.

It can be noted here that from the
International St1'ike Fund, the Inter-
national Union~has advanced $27,000 in

.bail .bond to cover fines which were

levied against the union in connection
with i’-the Taft-Tartley injunction suits
as a result of the Empire Zinc, strike.
These cases are still pending, and when
they are. settled, the‘ entire amount
will be returned if we win, but in any

event some $13,000 of this will be re‘-

turned.
Assets

If our financial position is consid-
ered from the standpoint of assets and

'liabilities, we find that at the close of

this fiscal year, our total. liabilities are
$13,557. Our assets, including the Con-'
tingency.Fund and the Strike Fund,
amo.unt_;to $309,638.-74. This compares
with total assets of $268,141.97 ‘at the
close of the last fiscal year, and $184,-
500 'for the previous fiscal year. It
represents an increase in total assets
of $41,496.77 o_r 15.5% for the year.
‘Now, lest_ these figures present a
misleading picture" of our current finan-

7cial condition, I want at this time to
discuss them briefly. The figures are
completely accurate for the period they
.cover—that is up to June 30, 1953.

That _is_ the Union’s,.fiscal year, and the

 period covered by‘-the audit. However,
. since June _.30, the.genera_l financial sit-

uation of the Union, has taken -a down-

ward trend... . -

'ually large expense.

ed in the diminished general fund ac-
count as shown in the audit. Not long
after June 30, operating expenseshad
reduced the general fund to the‘ critical
point.

For the first time since I had set
up the Contingency <14‘-und with the ap-
proval of the 1950 convention in Den-
ver, it» was necessary to make a with-
drawal from it in order to meet pay-
roll and current operating expenses.
Furthermore, for the first time, it was
impossible to set aside the usual 5c
allocation to the Contingency,"Fund
from per capita income. ,This means‘
that. we are now in debt to the Con-
tingency Fund about ‘$23,000. ' -

Now, why did -this occur"? Well, I
‘have pointed out that all expenses have
increased, including.salaries, transpor-
tation, per\diem, /printing, telephone
and telegraph and all other operating
costs. But. underlying all of these in-
creases ' are some of the following.
factors. ' ' '

Unusual expenses

The bargaining fight this year, com-
plicated by the most difficult circum-
stances in many years, entailed unus-'
This is the first
year it was necessary to hold three
meetings of the National Wage Policy
Committee. An unusual amount of
travel by the officers and bargaining
coordinators was involved. Telephone
bills shot sky-high.“ V .

Itwill be remembered that part of
the entire bargaining picture this year
involved the Lead-Zinc crisis. Delega-
tions to .Washington," interviews "with
Congressmen, appearances’ before Con-
gressional commitees’ and all of the

‘other activity in connection with this

effort ran into money.
The bargainin fight has

way in which dues money can be used.

‘Nevertheless, it does account to some

extent for the financial position
which we now find ourselves.
O
O

THERE ARE at number of other
factors involved as’well. Perhaps “the
delegates do not know that the Inter-
national Union handles the bonding of
all localiunion“ officers. Of course_ a
bonding company insures the risk and
is responsible for reimbursing losses
up to the amount of the’ bond coverage.

in

But the premium which the bonding’
company charges for this must be paid a

for three‘ years in advance.
to provide this service for the local
unions, the International Union had,
within the last 90.days, .to advance
approximately ten-thousand dollars to

the bonding company" for premiums

due.
The local uniorfs will, over the course’
of three years, reimburse the Inter-

national for this amount, but in”the.

meantime,__.it-was a substantial lump
sum to take out of the general fund

. harrassment

I

\

Legal defense

Legal defense costs have increased
this year. McCarran hearings and
phony Taft-Hartley indictments are de-
signed to harrass unions. Part of that
is the financial drain
which they entail. Within the past 60
days the International has advanced
$5,000’ to therilencks Defense Fund to ‘
secure the necessary servicesof out-
side "counsel for‘ that‘ case. ‘It"is' ex-
pected that this: money will ‘be re-
turned to the International from the

' Jencks Defense Fund, but it, was‘ im-
.peratiVe" that lawyers in addition...to

ourvown ‘counsel be secured at once.
The foregoing represent some cur-

rent expense factors which contributed f_,\

to the financial trend of the union in
the lastfew months.’ As a matter of
fact, if the union's "assets were calcu-
lated at the time of the writing.of this‘
report, they would. amount to $227,-
232.38 instead of the $309,000.00 shown
as. assets ._at the time the audit was
concluded. ‘ » ’/
/ o

“A POINT which should be made is

that althggh some of the above ex-
pensesseem extraordinary, the fact is
that as the attacks grow more intense 4
against labor, we "will likely find that
what_ in the past/were considered un-
usual expenses become the pattern.

Now, Whi1e\thiS "financial ‘condition’
is'no cause for alarm, it does, never-
theless,” indicate a financial direction
which is ‘dangerous’ if allowed to"
continue. ’

While Ifhave itemized some of the
above factors as contributing to our
current financial problem, over and
above all of these, and on the positive
side,‘ is the question o.f new organiza-
tion. This is perhaps the dominant
element in‘ our financial picture.

For more years than I can remem-
ber our conventions have emphasized
and insist_e'd_‘upon a dynamic _program
of new organization. This year, the
International Executive Board deter-
mined at whatever cost to expand our
organizational activity. It forthwith

-took _steps to do so. And to this pro-

gram can be" traced, along with the
other factors _mentioned above, the
reasons for in..=reased salaries, trans-
portation, per diem and other items.

New jorganizafion

This program of organization was
undertaken duringa rapidlychanging
political situation .in,the country and
in the labor movement. Our’ program‘
for new organization has always em-
braced the slogan ,“Win back proper-

_ ties lost in raids.” ' In. undertaking

this program, abortive attempts -were
made and money was spent to try to
retrieve such properties as St. Jo

Lead, vT.C.I. and cert_ain_other smaller
properties. These attempts were made
in a climate which "made it more and
more difficult fortheni -to be success-

Orr .pi¢keted from 1941 until August, -‘
,‘ 1953, when the Aft Auto Mechanics Union v_
I finuﬂy won a contract. “It was beginning.

to ‘get rather monotonoqs," said Orr. .

With the election of the Republican
administration, with the

business interests, there has developed

in the country a new surge towardy

-laboi‘ unity. ‘Workers have begun to
express more concern about finding
forms? of. mutual protection against

wage cuts -and united fights for main- ‘

tenance '.of employment and contract
conditionsthan they» do about which
union bargains fo" them. I

_. . . I. .'
IT BECAME AHPARENT in the

course of some of .these_organiz-ing
situations that the best interests'.o'f
our membership would be served by
concentrating our efforts‘ A

- pletely new organization. 
In spite of this early mis-direction’

of ounorgzlnizational efforts, a more

intense new organizing drive has been

carried on this year than for many
years. Staff and funds were allocated
to conduct big new drives in the
Southwest and in Canada which have
resulted in election victories and cer-
tifications which ultimately will in-
volve thousands of workers.

With tremendous government in-
vestments 'in mining development -in
both this country and Canada," great
new vistas of organization are open-

ing up. The Executive Board of the.“
International Union feels that it is "
imperative to take advantage of these‘

situations to build and strengthen our

union as well as‘ protect our jurisdic-5

tion.  . -
- ‘Money well spent _
It was calculated when" this organ-
izing drive began that- it "might "be
necessary to utilize some
unio_n’_s reserves in order to carry it

through to successful completion:.«I ' A
for one feel it is money well spent.”

On thisrsubject and speaking
strictly» from the standpoint of Sec-
retary—Treasurer, I must acknowledge
that organizing workers today is a

far more expensive process than it’

wasa few years ago. ~. _
Expenses are higher, wages are:

.higher, and we usually find our union';.'-’'

in vigorous, contest with other. unions

on the ballot who have almost sun- 7

limited financial resources. While
ever.y effort. is made’ to,» husband.._.o}1r
own "resources
funds as cautiously as possible, it is

no longer possible to ,organizc_on a,
shoe-string‘.

/ . .

NEVERTHELESS, I feel that th_e
membership of this union will support
continued, intensive new organization,

' even at the expense of having to con-
tribute to it financially more than it

' does now. .
I_ _have said, here, that any serious

'_ ‘attempt on our part" to u1idertake"'cam-i

paigns_ to win back properties lost by
secession or raiding would run up
against the general attitude of work-

_- -ers ,todaY-;_\ in -the face -.- of growing L

labor unity. But let me hasten --to say
-that we will not by one iota decrease

  Terror, Fafisfaiien uiba“  

CUB_A§——El terror Batista sigpe en
vigor en Cuba, especialmente contra
los organis-mos sindicalesy progresis-
tam, .' , —
"Sin embargo,‘ en medio de todo ese
terror; se esta desarrol_1andoJentI:e el
pueblo un frente de oposicion fuerte
’ y unido. Las masas del pueblo cubano
man dexhumor luchador militante- Q
En los talleres ‘cienes de trabaja-
dores abiertamente firman peticiones
demandando Ala libertad de Lazaro
Pena, por los motivos. de que no tuvo
ninguna conexcién con el “levanta-
miento” de Santiago y es un lider sin-
dical respetado por, todo el mundo.

A LO MENOS 200 domicilios- han‘

‘side invadidos_,so‘Io en Havana. Des-

" ‘ tacados intelectukales _y lideres dellpu-

eblo como Dr. .Juan Marinello, Blas
Roca y Anabal Escalante\. pronto seran

— sujetados a juicio bajo la nueva ley do

“Orden Pﬁblica.”

Miembros de muchos grupos de opo-

' sicién, tanto de indole derechista como
izqui.erdis‘ta, sufren iguales medidas de

supresién. Casi 300 miembros de los

'varios partidos‘ de oposicién todavia
p,ermanecen~ encarcelados; son denteni-

dos sin cargos formales, sin poder con- ._ 5 '
sultar con abogados ni con la prensa.’

Todos los que son arrestados, si no los
encarcelan, se les prohibe salir de la
' ciudad, no pueden asistir a juntas, etc.
Los encarcelados incluyen~ a Lazaro
Pena, iricepresidente de la Federacién
Sindical Mundial y de la.Confederaci6n

 de Trabajadores de América. Latina y

‘I

rel lider reconocido de todas las fuerzas
democraticas de ‘los sindicatos de

SE SABE que el Gen. Batista sigluel

deteniendo a lideres de la opo_sici6n
para asesinarlos en caso de que Socar-

ras intente un contra-golpe milita"r para "

derribar a Batista.

El.-atentado militar del dia 26 de‘

julio en Santiago'fué lanzado por un,
g'upo del Partido Orthodoxo. Log re-
su tados fueron desastrozos- Resulté

en una derrota completa,. quedaron.
cienmuertos y el gobierno de Batista .‘
hallo 'un pretexto para abrogar los‘,

derechos civiles. ‘ _ ,.
Mientras Itanto, las ‘fuerzas sindi-
cales-ly progresistas reiteran su opo-
sicién a “golpes militares,” seﬁalando-,
por ejemplo, que Batistaoquedé re-
forzado en -vez de debilitado por el
levantamiento de "Santiago. También
indican que solo uni frente unido de
todos los trabajadores, los campesinos,
la media clase y los sanos elementos
comerciales que desean la independen-
cia nacional y \ la democracia son
capaces .de‘ derrotar la distadura Ba-
tista. ' ' ' ~

_EN CAMBIO 'p1'oponen un gobierno, _

popular compuesto del frente unido con
un programa de reforms. agraria, me-
jores condicioiies de Vida, salarios mas
altos, ayuda a los desempleados, de-
fensa ‘de las’ industrias nacionales, sin-
«dicatos libres, libre intercambio con todo
