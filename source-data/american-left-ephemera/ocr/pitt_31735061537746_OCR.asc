  

other progressives, on some trumped up charge. Bought and
paid for renegades from Comunism are always in stock for a
series of sensationalized articles on “the Red menace.”

Keeping employers continually scared is also an essential
part of the racket. “Conﬁdential” information on ways to ﬁght
Communists, are sent them. Hair-raising stories are told of the
sweep of Communism. Lists of organizations are palmed off
as “front” organizations to impress the employer with the
“millions” of members in “Red” organizations. The trick is
to picture the “menace” as so wide that every employer is
bound to feel that his employees are affected and that he
should pay for Red—baiting service.

This blackmail isn't new. It took a simpler form in the days.

after the 1920 Red-raids of  Edgar Hoover, then under At-
torney General A. Mitchell Palmer. It was then common to
send fake threat notes to prominent reactionaries. This helped
to sensationalize the “Red-menace” among the people.

The Red-baiting racket has become the most up-to-date
form of industrial spy and union-busting service. Essentially,

the Red-baiting formula replaces the discredited Mohawk

Valley Formula. It is a recognition that the problem for em-

, players is not alone to keep unions out, but mainly one of

paralyzing existing unions.

The object is to plant agents in the ranks of unions to foster
factionalism and internal strife, split offs and other forms that
would weaken them as ﬁghting arms of the workers. The
Red—baiting formula opens a union’s door to the tools of reac-
tionaries. Anti-Communism is a convenient. cover—up for their
op-position to progressives and all honest leaders of workers.
Not all Red-baiters are conscious tools of employers. But they
play the game of the employer just the same.

Investment to either stop, smash or devitalize a union, or
to company-unionize employees, is not new for American cor-
porations. The Senate Civil Liberties Committee of which
Robert La Follette, ]r., was chairman, said in its report (Dec.
21, 1937) that “industrial espionage was found to be a com-
mon, almost universal practice in American industry” and
that the spy detective agencies which the committee in-

10

 

 

vestigated “include among -their clients the largest and most
representative American industrial corporations.”

The committee investigated only several major spy agencies
like Pinkerton’s, Corporation's Auxiliary, Railway Audit and
Inspection, and the Burns Detective Agency. Just for the

period 1933-36, it was able to uncover company expenditures,

totaling $9,440,000 for their services. A list of spy users made
public by the committee and their expendituresfor the period,
included: .

American Smelting and Reﬁning, $77,877; Baldwin Loco-
motive, $159,078; Bethlehem Steel, $72,285; Brooklyn Edison,
$40,905; Laclede Gas Light, $72,551; Mack Mfg., $69,803;
Milwaukee Electric Railway, $100,384; National Biscuit,
$721,451; N. Y. Shipbuilding, $130,754; Radio Corporation
of America, $45,654; Radio Corp. Mfg., $1,007,350; Republic
Steel, $74,555; Tennessee Coal and Iron, $413,826; Wheeling
Steel, $344,154; Chrysler C0rp., $275,534; Consolidated Edi-
son, $112,807; Curtis Publishing, $74,796; Electric Auto Lite,
$78,489; Frick Coke, $116,474;_General Motors, $1,019,056;
Goodyear Tire, $72,661; Illinois Steel, $66,931; Kroger.
Grocery, $50,000.

“Espionage,” said the La Follette Committee, “is the most
efﬁcient method known to management to prevent unions
from forming, to weaken them if they secure a foothold, and
to wreck them if they try their strength." And “raising the Red
scare is a common practice with detective agencies,” the re-
port adds.

The objective today is the same. But the methods for achiev-
ing them are adjusted to new conditions. The company opera-
tive today is more polished. He is directed to work inside a
union and to clothe himself as a “patriot.” He is coached on
proper behavior in a union, in the art of debate and par-

‘ liamentary trickery. Above all he is taught how to shout “Com-

munism” and ﬁnd “allies.” He is taught every method that
would rip a union’s insides. A —

You don't have to take my word for the above conclusions.
I have the authority of the United States Chamber of Com-
merce to back it fully. ‘ A

A FEW TIPS TO -MANAGEMENT

The United State Chamber of Commerce is the major direct-
ing center for ‘ipump-priming” the Red-baiting racket. Acting
through its Committee on Socialism and Communism, the
Chamber has recently issued a series of pamphlets on Com-
munists. The most important is one called Communists in
the Labor M0vement.* It is actually a handbook to employer
stooges inside labor ranks on the most effective ways to develop
factionalism and disruption within a union.

The “handbook” has been distributed by employers in
hundreds of thousands, oflcopies. It is the boldest and frankest
effort employers have made since the “Golden Rule” twenties

to prescribe a program and organizationfor their workers.

Amazingly plain language is employed. Management is
counseled on the best ways to ﬁnd and encourage stooges in a

‘shop. Employer stooges within unions are shown how to pick.

a union to its bones throu h the Red-baitin techni ue. The
_ 8 g ‘l .
primary targets are what the Chamber calls “Communist
dominated” unions, meaning any organization with leaders

-who wouldn’t play ball with management.

Let us begin with the Chamber’s advice to the employer.
The Chamber says:

 

Even under the Wagner Act, the employer often has real,
_if thoroughly unconscious, inﬂuence in naming of 'union
officers. Small but gracious concessions; frequent consulta-
tions, and recognition can often build up the stature of a
union ofﬁcial.

The NLRB does not allow direct intervention in
union affairs. But if the employer is not free to pick the
oﬂ‘icers he likes, the least he can do is abstain from actions
which hurt them. .

A word might be said about direct dealings with union
officials in an informal manner. It is occasionally possible
to sit down to dinner with "an international officer, the local
president or business agent. Such informal meetings can
be productive of real candor. Both sides can talk freely
without worrying about a reaction from those to whom they
must report.

It’s a dollar and cents question, stresses the Chamber, be-
cause: ’

mm W :-

’ Communists set
up standards which at times their opponents must imitate
through the- sheer necessity of self-preservation within the
union’s political structure. Often the employer himself is at
fault through the failure to grant opportune and face-saving
concessions to opponents of the Communist faction. It is
not unheard-of that employers will win small battles at the
conference table, costing American-minded o-flicers their union
jobs, and then lose ‘major Wars when their radical successors
give employers a taste of real demands. V A

~.___ :7 , T

The Chamber explains this, by showing an understanding

sympathy for Walter Reuther, president of the‘United Auto-

mobile Workers, for making demands which “cannotbe other
than inﬂationary.” “As a result,” continues the Chamber,
“Reuther faces an alternative: he must either be aggressive or
retire in favorof some Communist dupe. This explains in
part the conﬂict in his public statements. On the one hand
he may favor increased labor productivity and decry inﬂation-
ary wage rises. On the other hand he makes wage demands
which cannot be other than inﬂationary.”

Reuther, described as leader of the “anti-Communist” bloc
in the U.A.W., is seen as the sort of leader who could see eye
to eye with employers. But “Communist” inﬂuence in the
union forces him to put on a “militant” act. Therefore, people
like Reuther must be helped to get rid of Communists.

The Chamber gives similar honorable mention to others in
progressive-led -C.I.O. unions who have taken to Red—baiting.
The main direction of the Chamber’s ﬁre is against the C.I.O.
on the theory that the A. F. of L. is “free” of Communism.
The real reason, however, is more than Communism‘ in the
C.I.O., but'the fact that the C.I.O. as a whole is a far more
pr-ogressiveforce in the life of the country than the conser-
vatively-led AIF. of L. _ A

i Manage-ments are advised to call in “outside consultants who
are expert in handling Communism in the labor movement.”
The Chamber plugs for outﬁts like the Research Institute of

13 \

 
 

America directed by Leo Cherne and several other Right-
. . . wing Socialists. This outﬁt has, in fact, provided the Chamber
A 9 with the major material for its “handbook.” Another such
outﬁt of “consultants” calling itself American Business Con-
sultants consists of former F.B.I. agents who see greener pas-
l tures in capitalizing upon the Red-scare.

y The employer is warned against showing his hand in union
\

 

affairs ~too openly. Persons inside the union must be depended
y upon. The false “foreign agent” cry against Communists is
.1 the key to everything, stresses the Chamber. But that cry must
7 come fromstooges inside the union. The Chamber warns:

 

ij 7%

ll Such intervention might be
resented. He can be well satisﬁed if the general atmczphere
is hostile to Communism. ,
3 Of course, if some outside group with no economic interest 
. in the company is attacking Communism, this is a piece of
1 good fortune for the employer.* Thus, for example, vet-
erans and church groups have often been concerned with the
problem. '
1
l

Tj

This explains the existence of numerous fascist-like outﬁts
throughout the country in the business of ﬁghting “Commu-
nism,” like publisher Frank Gannett’s Committee for Consti—
tutional Government and Joseph P. Kamp’s Constitutional
Educational League. They are the source of numerous books,
‘ pamphlets ,and leaﬂets which are paid for by employers for
1 distribution or mailing to their employees. Thereby, the em— 
 ployers help keep the “atmosphere hostile to Communism” ‘
‘ T and friendly to their Red-baiting stooges. The newspapers and 1
,. radio,xof course, have an important part in this game of I
 providing the proper “atmosphere.” i
 y The same principle explains the big call on book publishers
’ ' by r for books hostile to the Soviet Union, or to the new ‘democ-
 racies of Eastern Europe. While the employer is cautioned

‘ i against using the plant paper or company bulletin boards for
K direct intervention in the union’s affairs, because it would
V 3 be a “kiss of death” to his friends, the Chamber does say:

1 14

 

Thus, it may
be helpful to discuss Communist tyranny in Yugoslavia or /
Poland, or the harsh peace treaties which were imposed upon
Italy and other nations at Soviet instigation. _ It might
also be possible to mail anti-Communist literature, such as
that listed in the bibliography, to the homes of potential
leaders of an opposition.

__j+

Thus, also, it should be evident that the continual poison-
ing of the air against the Soviet Union is important to the
trusts not only from the standpoint of their imperialist interest
abroad; it provides the “atmosphere” necessary for their dis-
ruptive tools in and out of labor unions.

The Chamber refers the company’s labor relations director

I to its bibliography of literature in the “handbook” that could

be helpful in fertilizing the ﬁeld within the union. Topping
the list is Victor A. Kravchenko’s I Chose Freedom. Then fol-
-low William C. Bullitt’s The Great Globe Itself; David 
Dallin’s The Real Soviet Russia; Eugene Lyons’ The Red
Decade; George Moorad’s, Behind the Iron. Curtain; Jan Val-
tin’s Out of the.Night; Louis Waldman’s Labor Lawyer; Ben-
jamin Gitlow’s I Confess. All but Bullitt (who wants atom
bombs dropped on Moscow now) are Socialists or renegades
from Communism who are now making Red-baiting a source
‘of big income for themselves The book by stoolpigeon Louis
Budenz’ was not off the press then. Also recommended by the
Chamber is the New Leader, organ of the Social-Democratic
Federation (David Dubinsky’s group) and The Wage Earner
and Labor Leader, papers of the Associationpof Catholic Trade
Unionists (A.C.T.U.).

The pattern is clear. Management must learn how to give
every form of support to its friends among the workers, but
do so without appearing to intervene in the aﬁairs of the
union. This is to be accomplished under the banner of anti-
Communism and anti-Soviet propaganda. .

GUIDING THE COMPANY STOOGE

The Chamber’s ‘y‘handb0ok” is just as speciﬁc in its instruc-
tions totemp-loyer stooges within the labor movement. The
15 '

 

  

stooge is taken step—by-step from formation of a‘ caucus to
secession.

Step one is the organization of a “machine” of the 7‘best
ﬁghters against reds.” Those could be recruited among the
most conservative elements in the union. But, the Chamber
deplores, most of those elements have little “experience.” It is
threfore suggested that: ‘ ’

_ As their allies they may have
some proletarian groups suchpas Socialists and Social Demo-
crats, and non-Stalinist Communist groups.

w————

The Chamber assures the employer that he needn’t fear
the Trotskyites (“Non—Stalinist— Communists”) and others
more recently swept out‘ of Communist ranks, or the Socialists
and Social-Democrats, because:

, In‘ practice. they are rarely numerous
enough to take over a Local. Normally, they merely add
_experience and militancy to the anti-Communist faction. In
union struggles, such experienced leaders contribute organiz-
ing ability and generalship, although their diverse ideologies
may add confusion. Those who have patriotic or religious
motivation, but lack experience. at ﬁrst can offer only zeal
and numbers, the while acquiring experience.

 

Having indicated whence a faction could get its recruits
and leadership the Chamber takes 1tS stooge through the neces-

sary steps in an imaginary local in a section called “Tactics
of Struggle”: e ‘ a

They met quietly in one an- l
other’s houses, whileholding the Communists in check from
meeting to meeting, and Worked out a slate for the next elec-
tion. Each member canvassed throughout the entire plant
and built up strength fora particular candidate, but no indi-«
cation was given thatithese candidates were part of a uniﬁed
slate. At the last minute, a merger was effected‘ and the
strength controlled by each member of the caucus was thrown
to all the candidates in the group. The Communists were *
caught off guard and soundly defeated. «

9 16

 

 

The Chamber warns that its agents may defeat their pur-
pose if they only shout Communism and don’t bring forward
some coverup issues "that give an appearance of ‘construc-
tiveness. Anti-Communism is the “cement” that brings to-
gether the various elements into a caucus but:

The Communist ﬁssures mob should not be
raised by the group: rather as individuals they ohoefld circu-
Ete such information by word of month.

gm
‘-f —r 7

V The Chamber is very speciﬁc in its instruction on design-
ation of a Red—baiters’ slate so it would have “balanced repre-

sentation”:

. In principle, all major departments, all
fully staffed shifts, ‘and each sizable minority group should
have a candidate on the ticket..~ This will prevent splinter
slates which divide the anti-‘Communist opposition and per-
mit the Communists to exercise the balance of power. Every
reasonable compromise should be made in order to avoid the
situation of too many candidates for a given office. '

A Having captured the local’s olﬁce, the anti-Communist
group is advised to “contact similar groups” in the union or
other unions so together they could be “passing out literature,
organizing demonstrations and exposing local Communist
concentrations.” Those appear to be the only kind of leaﬂets
and demonstrations the Chamber likes.

Much in the Chamber’s instructions guides employer stooges
on ways to keep control of a union and how to keep the Red-
baiting pot continually boiling. The caucus must be kept
alive at all cost_, warns the Chamber:

- Siucihna caucus prepares issues in detail before meet-
ings, outlining who is to make and who is to second motions,

give speeches, and call for the vote.
They must appoint alert ﬂoor

leaders who are prepared‘ to meet emergency situations and
who will be followed intelligently by other members of the
group. 7

7——

17

 

  

The “decent new officers” are urged to conduct meetings
with “ﬁrmness” against Communists: '

C p In this regard, it would be

 a fatal mistake to disband the caucus which originally won
 the election. The caucus can ensure attendance of meetings,
enter into preliminary discussion of important points, and
arrange disciplined voting to table Communist-inspired nui-
sance or political motions.

‘....~—.}

All the above steps follow if there is a chance to take over
a local. But, if both the national and local leadership of a
union is progressive and there is no chance to take over the
union, there is just one remedy, secession. The Chamber says:

On the other hand,
it IS possible that Communists control both the national union
and the Local. In such a case, the only remedy presently
available in most cases is secession of a large group and the
"petition for the National Labor Relations Board election for
_ new representation. Such .a drastic remedy is often unsatis- 4
C factory. however. and a better ‘solution. some urge would be
outside supervision of elections- .

The above pattern‘ could be easily recognized in many
C.I.O. unions. It is the blueprint followed by the Red—baiters
Q in all the unions plagued by factional strife. In the United
T  Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, the “U.E. Committee

* for Democratic Action,” led by James B. Carey, follows it to
the last detail. In the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union,
the stooges of the comp-anies carried the pattern to actual
secession. They were severely trounced on their last step when
decision came to a collective bargaining election.

In the National Maritime Union it is President Joseph Cur- ‘
ran who carries thelball, for the Red—baiters with the support
of some renegade ex-Communists, or “non-Stalinist Commu-
nists,” as the Chamber of Commerce calls them. The ship-
owners announced open support for Curran.

Former President Morris Muster tried the“ Chamber pat-
1} tern in the United Furniture Workersu Upon failing he
resigned and his group took the ﬁnal secession step. That too

18

 

 

failed. Hewound up in the furniture business. The same was
tried by Frank McGrath in the United Shoe Workers. He too
resigned when the jig was up. m

A very dramatic example of the Chamber line was furnished
during elections of Ford, Local 6oo of the U.A.W. The Red—
baiters brought everything in the Chamber’s handbook into
play in an effort to dislodge a progressive coalition from olﬁce.
They dressed up a man to look like Stalin and hung a sign
upon him saying “A vote for Tommy is a vote for me.”
Tommy Thompson was the progressive candidate. Life maga-
zine ran a full-page picture of the Stalin stunt. Other leading
magazines like Look, Colliers, and Time similarly plugged

for the Chamber's favorites as did all Detroit papers. But the

entire slate of Red-baiters was defeated by an overwhelming
majority when the local of 60,000 members gave the answer.

V What does all this get for the employers? They win no
matter what the outcome. Their union objective, of turning
the unions into a battleﬁeld between factions, is achieved
anyway. They measure the success of their plan by the extent

to which factional strife spreads from union to union.

SIGNALING THE FIFTH COLUMNIST

The Chamber’s handbook cautions employer tools that the
ﬁght isn’tover after progressive leaders are dislodged from of-

ﬁce, because “Reds” don’t give up so easily. So "management

and the “decent officers” must collaborate to eliminate opposi-
tion. Therefore, says a section titled “Consolidation of Power”:

_ ‘If the err‘-i;)loyer‘benalizes a Com-
munist for ﬂagrant violations o'f"p1an't rules, the officers
should not allow themselves to be pressured into defending

the culprit.
Against such tactics, the otﬁcers should pre-

sent a united front. Shop stewards should reject obviously
unsound and political complaints. The business agent and
the grievance-committee, should stand by the shop stewards.
If some of the stewards are Communist and do send poor
grievances to the higher steps, the poor ones should in gen’-_
eral be Weeded out ruthlessly. _ _ I ' .
.But under, no conditions should the _C0mml1n1StS be
allowed to clog up the grievance machinery. ‘ .

The Chamber counsels that it is above all necessary that
I r . u '
the “decent ofﬁcers” capture the -grievance machinery. But even

‘where a progressive is shop steward in a department, the

Chamber suggests a squeeze play that requires teamwork be-
tween the company and the Red-baiters. The section called
“Building from the Bottom” advises the company stooge-in a
department:

He may insinuate that better results could
be obtained if the workers handled their own grievances di-
rectly with the foreman. Or they may be able to get a non-'
Communist in the grievance committee to handle them upon
appeal. Or, ﬁnally, the non-Communist in the department
may be able togoad the shop steward into letting him take
up cases with the foreman.

The lant executive, meanwhile, is warned that it is his
I) 0 c 0 . ,,
“problem to prevent the Communists from capitalizing
upon success in ﬁghting for the workers in the shop. Conces-

‘sions /might be unavoidable, says the Chamber, “but with care

he (the employer) can see that the Communists do not get
too much credit for winning good cases.”
The Chamber then suggests a signal system as follows:

v

T7?

Thus, in most situations a grievance committee
is not politically uniform. Some membersat least will be
non-Communist. Their word and judgment can be trusted. ‘
If a case, on the surface, looks good to the industrial rela-«
tions director, he can direct the conversation to a decent‘ union
ofﬁcial. asking for his comment or opinion. When the latter
favors the granting of the grievance, the executive can answer
“yes,” thus disposing of the case. On the other hand, when

‘Communist-inspired and unreasonable grievances come up,

they should be given the burden of defending them. When
the answer from management is “no,” they bear the onus
of the defeat. ' ' '

 

Such methods, the Chamber thinks, will “build up the
prestzge” of employer friends, who will go “light” on
r grzevances. It’s a pattern of handling grievances with the help
of the managemenfs ﬁfth column among the workers.

I

PCOMMUNISM7’ THRU THE CHAMBERS EYE
l

Who, according to the Chamber of Commerce handbook,
is a Communist and what is Communism? We have already
seen that suspicion of Communism falls generally upon those
who press for higher wages and ﬁght for grievances.

The Chamber throws much more light in its pamphlet
Communists Within the Government. This was a report sub-

mitted to the government calling for a “loyalty purge” of '

federal employees. It was shortly after that report was pub-
lished by the Chamber that President Truman issued his
order for a “loyalty check” by the'F.B.I. Essentially he rubber-
stamped the Chamber’s plan on all major counts.

But it is particularly noteworthy that the Chamber has been
pressing for a loyalty check of everyone of the 2,200,000 on the
federal payroll, from the highest to the most lowly employee.
The Chamber has its eye on more than the members ofthe
Communist Party who may be working for the government.

“A digniﬁed and competent investigation of this type would .
educate the public to the realities of our foreign relations” ‘

suggests the Chamber. . '

“A real service could be rendered if the secret story of Yalta
and Teheran could be made public. Much that is sordid could
be revealed by a complete inquiry, but it would furnish the
basis for an intelligent and realistic foreign policy. V

“A handful of advisors in the Treasury formulated the basic
program of the Potsdam agreement in Germany, which played
into the hands of Soviet policy and which we have been forced
to repudiate.” ' ' '

After thus making it plain that the framers of the Roosevelt
policy of “Big Three” unity as a ‘basis of peace is the real
objective, not “Communists,” the Chamber goes on:

“It would be interesting to discover who effected our re?
pudiation- of Mihailovitch in favor of Tito. . . . Another
enlightening inquiry would uncover the forces behind our
intervention in Argentina which scuttled the Good Neighbor
Policy and. furnished ammunition for Communist propaganda
in Latin America. K ‘

21

 

 

  

“Who furnished misleading military intelligence as to the
situation in the Far East resulting in our granting far-reach-
ing but uncalled for concessions to the Soviet Union?

“It is well known that forces in the State Department are
pushing the cause of the Chinese Communists against the

constituted national authority ofvChina. The authors of such-

memoranda would bear investigation. The full story of
U.N.N.R.A. has not been told.

“It would be interesting to note the stimulus given Com-
munist-controlled unions by certain ofﬁcials in government
labor boards.”

From the above it is clear that by “Communists,” the cor-
poration minds mean followers of Roosevelt, Henry Wallace
and persons friendly to labor. ‘ —

The Chamber goes further: ‘

It should examine the forces which led to
their original appointments. Their recommendations for per-
sonnel should be scrutinized. Finally, any ofﬁcial who appointed
' 1 a substantial number of such persons should in turn be suspect.
as to ‘loyalty or judgment.

T: tfé

T7

It isn’t ignorance or stupidity that prompts the Chamber In
so broaden its deﬁnition of Communism that even one who
appoints a Wallace-Roosevelt man is “suspect.” It is clever
application of a technique Hitler worked successfully for a
time. The real object is to purge the government even of mild
liberalism. So the deﬁnition of “Communism” mustbe broad
enough to provide a dragnet for all shades of progressives.

The same pattern follows for trade unionism. A labor
leader must be publicly known as a Red—baiter to escape the
Chamber’s index librorum prohibitorum.

A third anti-Communist “study” by the Chamber, Commu-
nist Inﬁltration in the United States, stretches Communist in-
ﬂuence to embrace numerous stars in -the ﬁlm colony, some
of the most. prominent radio commentators, screen writers,
authors, and College educators. The Chamber’s demand that
businessmen stop sponsoring “Communists” on their programs

22 -

 

l
t
E

has already borne its fruit. A large number of commentators

on the air who still held to the Roosevelt line were purged. _

WHO INTERFERES IN UNIONS?

. Interference? Inﬁltration? Outside meddling?

There is plenty of it to alarm the trade union movement. a

The Chamber of -Commerce handbook shows where it comes
from. We analyzed the Chamber’s formula, but it is no less
the program of the National Association of Manufacturers
or any other reactionary body in the United States.
Weakening, disruption and smashing of labor unions is
smashing the backbone of progressivism. Without a powerful
and aggressive trade union movement it is inconceivable to

have a coalition of labor, farm, professional and small 'busi- ‘

ness people. Surely no real independent political movement
representing those forces is possible without a strong and free
labor movement. .

Using the Red-baiting formula of the Chamber the Pinker-
tons now carry out their assignment under the banner of
“anti-Communism.” They try to divert attention from their
own interference in unions by constantly keeping before the
public the lie that Communists “interfere,” “inﬁltrate” and
“meddle” in unions. .

Communists are in unions, of course. It is a poor Commu-
nist who doesn’t join the union of his trade or industry. The
most elementary requirement for membership in the Com-
munist Party is a pledge to be a devoted and active ﬁghter in
the ranks of the working class. Communists are distinguished
from others primarily by their view that capitalism has long
ceased to be a force for progress, has become a reactionary
obstacle to further advance, and must give way to a new social
order in which the means of production are controlled gocially
—by those who contribute usefully by hand and brain.

Thus, the Communists are progressives whovlook beyond
the concessions being wrested from employers now. They see
every step ahead as a step closer to a stage when the common
people will actually be united and organized to win socialism.

23

    

It is quite natural, therefore, for Communists to be active in
all movements for progress and to be generally the most

' dynamic force within them, be it on a small community issue,

or for something of nationwide scope. Communists press for
more rapid progress and, thereby, greater speed toward
socialism.

The road of the Communist Party is the road of the working
class as a whole. The only distinction is that the Communists
are aware of the factthat the road leads to socialism and they
are constantly trying to make others aware of it. The more
widespread the consciousness and support for the perspective
of socialism, the more rapid will be the progress toward that’
goaL s .

It is by this common viewpoint,‘ and the militancy, activity

and higher working class knowledge and training this view-
point generates, that you can generally tell a Communist. It is
adherence to Marxist teachings‘ that explains common atti-
tudes by Communists in. a union in San Francisco, Chicago or
New York. _
' As a matter of fact, Communists and to_,a large extent those
in the progressive Left, are the only people in the labor move-
ment today who are really united through basic principles.
Most of the basicprogressive aspects of the C.I.O.’s program
have been advocated by the Left 10 and 15 years before the
C.I.O. was even born. One need only scan through William
Z. Foster’s American Trade Unionism, (International Pub-
lishers) a collection of his writings for some 30 years, to see that
the Left launched a movement in 1921 for industrial unionism,
for independent political'actio”n by labor, organization of
the unorganized, and for international labor solidarity. The
writings of Communists remain to‘ this day the most author-
itative works on all those topics. The same holds trueon
methods of organization, strike strategy, problems of the un-
employed, struggle for Negro rights and on the general ques-
tion of trade union democracy.

Nor were Foster and the Communists crystal—gazers back in
the twenties when they ‘warned the labor movement that the
phony prosperity of that period would crash, and that the
many union banks, and labor-management sweetheart and

speedup schemes would also crash. The teachings of Marxism
enable Communists to. see ahead and see through the propa-
ganda_of the trusts. A '  ' '
sThe enemies of labor would have "people think that the
unity of thought and action among Communists is the result
of a “conspiracy” or “foreign” inspiration. They ﬁll the press

and all channels of information with stories of Communist

“interference” or “,inﬁltratio’n” in labor ranks.

From our detailed analyses of the Chamber of Commerce
pattern we know why they do this. It is under“ the guise of
ﬁghting Communist “interference” that the enemies of labor
themselves interfere, inﬁltrate and meddle in trade union
affairs. The “Red issue” has become the means through which
agents of employers and all reaction; pry open the doors of

the house of labor for themselves. The issue provides the '

cloak for ‘stoolpigeons, company-union elements, strikebreak-

hers, and for the opportunist characters who try to advance

themselves by playing the employer’s game.
We have also seen from the Chamber’s pattern that the
anti-labor forces are very much interested in cultivating the

services of other groups in labor ranks. As the Chamber said ‘

“experienced” people are needed to bring the desired factional
strife into -labor ranks. Listed as “allies” are the Social-Demo
crats and Socialists (David Dubinsky and Norman Thomas);
and “Non-Stalinist Communists” (Trotskyites and the n1ore
recently expelled turncoats from Communism).

Still another group that has the warm praise of the Cham-

ber is the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists, which

covers up its Red-baiting with religious sentimentf
Why shouldn’t the Chamber love the A.C.T.U.P Here’s how

Pennsylvania A.C.T.U. chairman V/Villiam Hart, also director a

of District 19 of the United Steelworkers of America, ex-
plained his program to workers of the Robertshaw Company,
Youngblood, Pa., on August 14, when he addressed them
jointly with the company’s manager over the plant loudspeak-
ing system: '

“You just cannot loaf yourself into prosperity,” the Greens-

bury Morning Review quotes him. “You have got to put the
money into the barrel if you want to take it out. . . . Do not

fail to recognize that your takehome pay is not going. to be
affected, that even though your time study rate is cut, you can
by increasing production maintain your takehome pay. . . 

Main reliance is on the Socialists and Social-Democrats.
They have a substantial base in the labor movement, mainly
in the ladies’ garment, textile, and in the group around
Walter Reuther in the automobile union. We have seen
earlier in this pamphlet how the Chamber of Commerce ad—
Vises its supporters to regard the Socialists as allies. Business’
Week, America’s «leading voice of Big Business, was just as
explicit in its issue of June 7, 1947. v

Business Week is happy becaus-e there are some voices in
the labor movement who see some good in the Taft-Hartley
Law, and adds: “Some of its members gravitate around what
is left of the Socialist Party, but they have no common doc-
trine, or program. . . . They are to be found in the greatest
number in A. F. of L. unions, like the ladies’ garment workers
where the socialist tradition, though badly tattered, hangs on;
and in the C.I.O. unions, like the auto workers where the
bureaucracy has never dug itself‘ in.”

Business Week further observes that the Socialists have, in

days gone by, been the “seedling out of which a large section 3

of labor leadership has grown” and looks hopefully for the
renewed role of “socialist seedlings.” Their hopes were well
founded. The Socialists were the ﬁrst to call for compliance
with the Taft-Hartley Act. _
V Why shouldn’t the Chamber love the “socialist” variety of
Red-baiterP It was on their initiative that 33 union leaders
acting as the labor committee of the National Planning Asso-
ciation, issued a statement that received nation-wide publicity.
It declared that “management and labor should cooperate in
raising productivity” and that efforts should be made to revive
the labor-management production committees which “were so
unfortunately abandoned when hostilities ended.” Declaring
as does the Chamber and the N.A.M. that higher wages must
depend on “increasing productivity” of labor the 33 labor
leaders call upon the unions to “initiate” speedup programs.
Signers include James B. Carey, who comes from Socialist
ranks; Walter Reuther, Emile Reive and S01 Barkin (textile);

Max Zaritsky of cap and millinery; Lazare Tepper for Dubin-

sky’s I.L.G.W.U.; and Willard Townsend of ‘Transport.

Service. ~
The “non—Stalinist Communist” category, which is also

i on the Chamber’s p-referred list, includes the Trotskyites

(principally around the Socialist Workers Partyand their
weekly, the Militant), "and some “leftists” who were_ expelled
from Communist ranks more recently. The latter includes
principally the Dunne-Darcy-Keith group which is mainly
responsible for the. injection of Red-baiting disruption within
the National Maritime Union. '

- Employers through newspapers, radio and other means may
ﬁll the air with anti-Communist agitation to hysteria levels.

_They may have large numbers of stooges among the workers

——the sort that play a part in a company union. But it takes
the experienced operators in the groups described above to

T lend an “ideological” character to the disruptive faction. They

know how to demagogically give an “anti-capitalist” tone to

their pro-employer work. They are artful factionalists. They T

are the ﬁngermen for reaction.

The classical example of what a few Red-baiting factionalists
could mean in a union was the case of Homer Martin, who
was president of the ‘United Automobile Workers until 1939.
A shifty character, an artful demagogue and an opportunist,
Martin was made to order for a group of Social-Democrats
and expelled renegades from Communism led by Jay Love-
stone, He gave them the run of the union and they showed
him‘ how to be a dictator and hold on to the presidency. When
Martin at long last was dislodged and hedeparted with a
number of locals, leaving the U.A.W. nearly a wreck, the world
learned that he was an agent of the Ford Motor Co. He later
received a parts supply agency from the company, evidently
as a reward for delaying organization of Ford’s at least two
years.

The N.M.U. narrowly escaped similar capture by ship
owner agents when a mob mostly of gangster elements, led
by one Jerry King, seized the union with baseball bats and
Red-baiting as weapons.

There were scores of Homer Martins and Jerry Kings since

' 27

   

Z that time.,In every case you hadpto look for the handful of

Right-wing Socialists, Trotskyites, A.C.T.U.’ers and elements
expelled from Communist ranks, to ﬁnd out who coached
them. These groups specialize in the profession of applying
proper makeup for the ignorant company stooge or the
strong—arm character, so he’ll look like a labor leader. They
teach him how to sling “working class” language. They are
especially expert in the art of poisoning the minds of youth-
ful honest workers.

The same formula has often served to cloak the racketeer
and gangster elements who entrench themselves in the labor
movement. Under the guise of combating “Communism” or
the “Left-wing” all opposition to their machines is terrorized.
Notorious labor officials who earned prison sentences for
extortion, embezzlement, racketeering and murder were rabid
Red—baiters when in union olﬁce. V

The late “Scarface” ‘Al Capone, who headed the gigantic
Chicago racket and murdervsyndicate, wrote as follows in a
Libertyimagazine article while still serving his prison term:

“Bolshevism is knocking at our gates. We can't afford. to
let it in. We've got to organize ourselves against it and put
our shoulders together and hold fast. We must keep America
whole, safe and unspoiled. We must keep the worker away
from Red literature and Red ruses; we must see that his mind
remains healthy.” l _

. The Chamber of Commerce formula is the Capone formula.

 TAFT-HARTLEY LAW MAKES IT LEGAL

The Taft-Hartley Law is admission by its sponsors that all
the known methods to restrain, weaken or smash unions have
not stopped the forward march of labor. It is an attempt to
accomplish anti-union objectives by law.

Americans are now familiar with this ifascist—like measure.
In essence it provides a network of don’ts and hurdles to
make it virtually impossible to achieve a union shop; to so
hamstring and restrain unions as to greatly depreciate their
role as ﬁghting /organizations of labor; to establish what

28

 

i
l

 

amounts to governmental regulation and thought control over
unions and their internal life and to outlaw independent
political activity by labor. _ T

Under the subject covered in this pamphlet we are primarily
concerned with the law as: ‘ g

1. i A green light to revival and spread of company unionism.
Outlawing of union shop conditions and imposition of other
restraints upon the real unions would open the way for dis-

' ruptive phony outﬁts. A

2. Employer intervention in union affairs, through support
of anti-union agitation or opposition groups within a shop
is no longer an “unfair labor practice.” Only proof of an
employer’s direct threat to ﬁre a worker for union member-
ship is violation of the law. This makes legal the relationship
between employers and groups of their choice (ﬁfth columns)
among the workers. '

3. The requirement thatall workers in a shop (union,
non-union and anti-union) must show aimajority for a union
shop before it could be put forward as a demand. This puts
a high premium on what even a small anti-union minority in
a shop could do. .

4. The provision of damage‘ suits by~‘en1p1oyers against
unions for alleged violations of contract, re-establishes the role
of the secret company operative on a new basis. One obvious
method is to sabotage and frame the evidence against the
union. But the more serious form is steering Red-baiting
factions within the union for sabotage of union contracts
under the guise of T‘reVolt” against “Communist” union of-
ﬁcials.

5. An employer is now able to initiate a petition for a col-
elective bargainingelection and time it to the advantage of a
phonyg“union”'of his choice. This enhances the usefulness
of the secret operatives or. other “anti-Communists’-’ versed
in the art of setting up such outﬁts.

6. With the closed shop and hiring exclusively through the
union outlawed, employers are free to shift their specialists
in union-busting from plant to plant, department to depart-
ment, where needed. ’

7. With the breakup of bargaining units on craft or depart-

UNION-BUSTING BECOMES A PROFESSION

“People afraid to speak their minds, people afraid to meet
for discussion on unpopular subjects, people afraid to be seen
talking with certain other people, people afraid to be known
to read certain books——all these are afraid not because of any
valid wrong-doing, but just because of what might be sus-
pected. You are no longer innocent until proven guilty——you

are in a position where you must be prepared to prove your
innocence.” c

That was how Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt described tl1e stifling
atmosphere that is developing in the United States in her
column (World-Telegram, Aug. 28, 1947) just a few weeks
after President Truman’s ‘-‘loya1ty” purge got under way and

_a few days after the Taft-Hartley Law took effect. The late

President’s wife who had herself on occasions given encour-
agement to Red-baiters laments over the consequences.

“Red scare” raising has always been a weapon of reaction-
aries against progressives, a weapon of the rich against the
poor, ignorant against the enlightened, the trusts against the
people. Its major base today is in the union-busting ﬁeld.

Unions have had to struggle for the right to exist since
their earliest days. During the ﬁrst stages unions were outlawed
by the courts as “combinations to restrain trade.” It took a
great deal of ﬁghting before unions smashed this legal bar-
rier. But American industrialists were always resourceful in
developing new strikebreaking and anti-union weapons.
Among them were the injunction, importation of non-union
or strikebreaking forces from other parts of the country or
from abroad, transfer of plants away from unions, sealing
towns against “agitators,” pitting group against group on
ground of race, national origin, religion or politics, and the
use of police, state and federal. troops against workers-.7 4- -

ment lines very much eased in the new law, still another pos-
sibility to split has been opened for the disrupters under. the

' guise of opposing “Communist” representation.

8. The entire pattern of the law is framed to encourage

conservative leadership over active, militant unionism. The V

ban upon political activity by unions is an example.

9. The National Labor Relations Board is forbidden to
either certify a union or investigate its complaints against
employers, unless all of that union’s oﬁicers have ﬁled aﬂil
davits stating they are not members of the Communist Party,
or any organization viewed as an “aﬂiliate” of the Commu-
nist Party or who “support” any organization that allegedly
“believes in or teaches the _overthrow of the government.”

The anti—Communist point is the key to the entire Taft-
Hartley Law pattern just as the stirring up ofanendless anti-
Red hysteria is the key to the general reactionary program in
the country. “Communism” was used as an issue in the
November, 1946, Congressional election that gave us the 80th
Congress and’ the Taft-Hartley Law. Red’-baiting, contributed
especially by the Allis-Chalmers Corp., shipowners, Eric John-
ston and other spokesmen of Big Business, played a big part
in the Congressional hearings that led to the Taft—Hart1ey
Law. . '

Look at every one of the points noted" above and you will
immediately see the part cut out for the Red,-baiter. They all
provide a loophole for employer fifth—columnists. Anti-Com-
munism in the main providesthe present-day cover for the
formula of disruption, just as it was projected in the Chamber
of Commerce‘ “handbook.” The Taft-Hartley Law gave it
legal status. '

Notice how framers of the law took care to place under its
ban eve‘n union ofﬁcers who “support” any organization that
 supposed to “believe or teach the overthrow of the govern-
ment.” This was deliberately sophrased in order that leaders
with even mild progressive inclinations would come under
the club of an F.B.I.-inspected and licensed unionism. The
phrase “aﬂiliates” of the Communist Party was written into
the law for the same reason. Under it any non-Communist

30’

 

 

organization of America’s progressive front could be so classi-
ﬁed. ' .
Ironically, the framers of the Taft-Hartley Law’ lifted the

,anti-Communist clause from the constitutions of reactionary-

led unions. The formula was originally conceived as a weapon
against those who ﬁght for democratic rank and ﬁle control,
organization of unorganized, independent political action by
labor, industrial and militant unionism, against racketeering
or Negro exclusion and the rest of the program of progressive
unionism. Little did the proponents of such “Hitler clauses”
in union constitutions dream that they were opening the door
for a government—supervised and F.B.I.-inspected thought con-
trol over labor. -

BUILDING ON BIG LIES"

The Red-baiting racket rests upon a distortion of the views

and activities of the -Communists. It feeds upon continual

falsiﬁcation of what the Communists stand for.

There are two ways of suppressing the freedoms of speech,
thought, press or assembly. One way is through direct sup-
pression as was done in the Axis" countries and as today in
Spain. The other is to so overwhelm the people with false-
hoods_about the suppressed group that the truth about it
would be drowned out. Under the latter technique the free-
doms are formally allowed, but theirexercise by those at-
tacked is often as inaudible as the cry of a victim before a
howling lynch mob.‘

Our American brand of Red-baiting (and fascism, too)
rests mainly upon the latter form. This is why it is palmed off
in the name of “Americanism,” “Democracy” and “freedoms”
by the carload. We don’t suppress anyone. Not only do we
allow Communists (we still do at this writing) to publish,
speak and assemble, but we put our famed scribes on the job
to dish out news pages full on “communism” every day. We
headline it. Some of, our best advertised radio commentators
give the subject primary-attention. And the biggest bogl<
and magazine publishers can hardly be accused’ of neglecting
the topic.

31

 

    

  

So no one can say “Communism” is suppressed, the land
is running wild with freedom to lie, distort, falsify, exaggerate,
forge, tell half the truth, prejudice people and scream hysteri-
cally, about Communism. ’

The labor movement as a whole has just gone through the:
treatment given the Communists. With a few monopoly
chains controlling the bulk of newspaper circulation, news
wire services and newsprint, less than a dozen of some 1,700
daily papers -opposed ‘the Taft—Hartley Law. These same
monopolists of news owned in 1944 508 of the 886,radio
stations, and they own the most powerful ones, too. They did
a propaganda job on the labor movement, picturing it as
they would like the public to see it, not as it is. ‘The labor
movement had to pay for ads. to reach some people with its
answer. This job of drowning out the truth was carried
through despite the great" power of the 15,000,000-strong
labor movement. How much more true is this with respect
to Communism? ’ ’ ‘

Here are ten choice samples of anti-Communist “big lies”:

0 Communists are for “force and violence.”

The exact contrary is the truth. Far from being for force
and violence, the constitution of the Communist Party (printed
and available to all) speciﬁcally provides for expulsion for
advocacy or practice of acts of force and violence. It is the
foes of Communism who indulge in violence like strikebreak-
ing, lynching, discrimination, and persecution of Commu-
nists.

o Communists want to transplant the Soviet Union’s system
to America.

Communists in America and in all other countries re-
peatedly stress that each country will ﬁnd its own path to
Socialism. This is showing itself well in recent developments
in several European countries that have advanced far toward
Socialism but at the same time by-passed some of the early
stages that marked the Russian Revolution. American Com-
32

  

 

\

munists, noting the tremendous technical advancement of "our
country, see the possibility of a socialism here that would be
far, more beneﬁcial for the great majority of the people than
socialism is for those of lesser developed lands.

o They “want” a crisis because they “thrive” on chaos.

y How can that be said when the Communists are the most ac-
tive forces for immediate improvement of the lot of the people.
Many authorities say in this country that raising purchasing
power of the people is holding off a crisis. Then Communists
are obviously making the greatest effort to hold off a depres-

sion and mass unemployment. Communists do point out that V
-a real and permanent solution of the problem willrnot be

foundiwithin the framework of Capitalism.

0 They are “foreign agents.”

In twenty—eight years of Communist Party history this charge
has been peddled but it was never backed by a shred of evi-

dence. On" the other hand, evidence of -Communist loyalty

and sacriﬁce in the interest of America’s peop-le would ﬁll
volumes.‘ Even its enemies conceded that thewartime role of
its members, both in the armed services and on the production

° front, was unexcelled. The Party’s struggles on numerous
' fronts for labor, against discrimination, for civil rights, its

historic leadership of the unemployed, its pioneering in the

-ﬁght upon native and foreign fascism—what is this but ﬁght-

ing for a better America?

a They instigate strikes.

The foes of Communism merely throw this charge around
but not one of them has ever undertaken to prove it. The
truth is that unions generally classed under Left leadership
show no greater number of strikes than do the other unions.
And this is the truth despite provocative efforts of employers
aimed precisely against ‘those unions. Communists, just like
others, try to avoid the strike weapon if possible, but use it
effectively when they must.

- 33

  

0 They bring factionalism into unions.

This charge comes from the very ones who inject internal
strife in unions, but who justify it by claiming they are doing
it against “Communism.” One of the major slogans of the
Communists calls for a united labor movement and, until this
is achieved, for united C.I.0.-. A. F. of L.-Railroad Brother-
hoods‘ action on common’ issues like struggle to repeal the
Taft-Hartley Law. The charge of factionalism against Com-
munists also comes from labor bureaucrats, racketeers, and
other types of entrenched reactionaries who would stamp out
any progressive opposition in their unions.

0 They are against religious freedom.

Communists are the outstanding advocates of the democratic
principle of separation of the church from the state, and com-
plete freedom to believe or not to believe. Only those who
seek to impose or maintain a single church as a “state re-
ligion” make the charge.

0 They appeal to racial feelings.

This charge comes mainly from the Rankins and Bilbos

of the South who believe in the kind of order that holds mil— -

lions of Negroes in subjection‘ to a handful of white “super-
men.” It also comes from people who think the best way to
avoid ‘racial strife isto close their eyes to the outrages against
the Negro people or to anti-Semitism. The Commiinists are
working for Negro-white unity against all forms of discrimina-
tion—and against those who appeal -to race prejudice.

o They are.n.’t sincere.

Is there another group of people in the United States that
has faced as much» abuse, slander, persecution, including jail,
even denial of a right to earn a living, because of the princi— ’
ples they hold? There is nothing to induce a person to be a
Communist but the conviction that only through ultimate

34

 

 

socialism can we make this country a better place for the
common people.

3 They manipulate themselves into ‘strategic union posts,
through secret, methods, but don’t have popular support.

This lie comes from those who ﬁnd ithard to explain why
it is that hundreds of thousands of workers ignore Red-baiting
propaganda and repeatedly re-elect those who are attacked as
Communists. It is not an accident that many Communists get
elected. They are among the most active, aggressive and often
best trained workers in a union. They owe this to the kind of
education they receive in the Communist Party. Their zeal
for day to day activity to advance the immediate interests of
the workers is greatly stimulated by their belief in and drive
for socialism. Every gain the working class wrests from capi-
talism is a step closer to socialism. The more rapid the gains",
the speedier the people travel to socialism.

This campaign of falsehood about Communists continues
without letup. It must continue if the ground for Red-baiting
is to be preserved. The technique requires that Communists
and their views be described in the most unpopular-light
possible; that hate, hysteria,violence, scorn and prejudice be
whipped up against Communists.

Red-baiting wouldn’t be able to serve‘ as a smear brush
otherwise. People wouldn’t be afraid to be blackmailed by it.
It would not be an eﬁective scare weapon against progressives.

Non-Communists of even a mild progressive tinge will con-
tinue to be the object of Red-baiting, blackmail, and smear
until the truth about Communists and their views reaches the
masses of American people. Only when the American people
stop being suckers for phony propaganda about Communists
will it become impossible to arbitrarily pin Red labels upon
people who aren’t really Communists. .

This is why suppression or distortion -of the views of Com
munists is suppression and distortion of the views of any
people disliked by reactionaries. A

SMASH THE BLACKMAIL RACKET

In this pamphlet we have shown how the Red-baiting‘sys-
tem works and the great racket that has been built upon it. It
works on the basis of ﬁlling the airywith falsehoods about
Communism, then blackmailing with a “Red list” persons
who wouldn’t dance to the tune of reaction. '

It is a weapon against all people’ of progressive inclination.
Its successful use is the ﬁrst step toward fascism. The Nazis
began in Germany as an anti-Communist and anti-Jewish
movement. Their advance did not stop until even advocates
of conservative capitalist democracy landed in concentration
camps. On an international scale the Axis began as the “anti-
Comintern Alliance.” When this alliance ran its course the
Axis conquered or challenged most of the capitalist lands.

It is interesting that many features of the Taft-Hartley law
bear a striking resemblance to the early decrees of the Nazis.
Hitler, too, professed to be interested only in protecting the

unions from abuse. One such earl decree,'called “Proc1a—.
Y

mation for the Protection of German Lab-or,” said “we do not
want to disrupt or destroy the unions.” Their purpose, the
Nazis said, aimed only to end “Marxist” domination of
unions. That proclamation also ‘said that:

“The right to protest against dismissal of an employee
shall not subsist if the dismissal is based on suspicion‘ of
an attitude of hostility to the state.”

Soon after that decree the unions were placed under the
complete supervision of Nazis and turned into the. “Labor
Front” of the Hitler regime. Must we wait until native Ameri-
can fascists take the helm before we recognize the fascist pat-
tern? ’

The fascist weapon of Red-baiting will continue to menace
the people just as long as Americans allow themselves to be
blackmailed by it. A British journalist here recently expressed
amazement up-on the extent of Red-baiting poison in Ameri-

, can life. He said:

“There is a great deal of opposition in England to Commu-
nism and the Soviet Union, of course. But it doesn’t take the"

36 ‘

 

._» .._.».....___..__..._.—-—-— ‘A444 4
u

 

form of rabid Red-baiting as you have. A man cduldn’t earn a
lot of money at the profession of Red-baiting in England.”

M/hen Americans stop being suckers for Red-baiting, and
when Communists receive the same rights as any other citi-
zens, the Red-baiting racket won’t pay here, either.

C.I.O. or A. F. of L. unions, for their own elementary union
rights, should realize that Red-baiting can have no more place
in a labor organization than scabbing. If unions expect to pre-
serve themselves as organizations of all workers, as they must
be, then they must also prove to their enemies that Red-baiting
won’t work. This means a stop to such appeasement of the
blackmailers as inclusion of anti-Communist clauses in union
constitutions or adoption of other Red-baiting methods. Ap-
peasement only proves to the Red-baiters that their weapon
still works. The 1947 convention of the United Electrical,
Radio and Machine Mlorkers in Boston found it necessary
to adopt precisely such a policy to cope with the disruptive
activities of the forces led by James B. Carey. t

Ruling out Red-baiting as an anti-union weapon does not
mean ruling out criticism of Communists. On the contrary, a
condition would exist under which Communists would meet

p the test of popular opinion on the basis of what they really are

and not on the basis of the false description of Communists as
given by their worst enemies. The Communists are most an-
xious for a clearing of the air because they believe that their
greatest strength is the truth about themselves. The same con-
dition would also make it impossible for reactionaries to raise
the issue of Communism falsely or to pin a Red label upon

, non-Communist progressives.

Communists do not want others to be targets for views and
acts for which only they (the Communists) are responsible.
The Communists welcome criticism provided they have a right
as Americans to return it. Give Communists this freedom and
stealers of union funds, racketeers, machine bureaucrats and
vari-ous types of employer agents will not be able to take cover
under the cloak of anti-Communism, as they do now.

The Ninth Convention of the C.I.O., held in Boston, Oct.
13-17, noted the extent to which Red-hunting has already

37

 

  

 

advanced us toward a police state policy. -In its resolution on
Protection of Democracy, the convention declared:

“The President’s executive order 9835, purporting to pro-
vide a means for weeding out disloyal government employees,
is a grave danger to the liberty of government workers. Not
only does it disregard the basic democratic principles of fair

hearing and a fair trial but it encourages the establishment of _

a thought police under which every form of political deviation
on the part of government workers may become an occasion
for their discharge. This dangerous order can only have the
effect of regimenting our government workers and imposing
vicious controls upon their freedom.

“This repressive loyalty order has already formed the basis
for an attack upon union members in non-government plants
working upon government orders. An increasing number of
workers have been barred from their jobs on the basis of the
vague standards of this loyalty order and as a result of the
arbitrary judgment _of federal censors of their political views.

“The attack upon the rights of labor has also been pro-
jected in the form of persecution of labor leaders. Reproduc-
ing exactly the pattern of repression of the 1920's deportation
proceedings have been commenced against labor leaders who
are non-citizens and who have resided here for many years.

“Our democracy has been weakened and imperiled by the
far-reaching restrictions and the loss of freedom which large
groups of people have suffered during the recent period. We
cannot afford a repetition of the witch-hunts, the division,
the disunity, the strikebreaking and the hysteria which ﬂour-
ished in this country in the 192o’s. ’

“We are faced with a real and present danger to our
democracy. That danger is no less because thosewho seek to
rob us of our liberties profess to be acting in the name of
liberty and against totalitarianism. -

“That danger is no less because the persecution of our
people and the denial of the civil rights is accompanied by
a stock formula that no witch-hunts are intended.

“That danger is no less——but far greater-—because govern-
ment interference .with the economic and political liberty
of our people comes at the very time when the arrogance

and aggressiveness of monopoly and its reactionary political
spokesmen are increasing.

“That danger is no less because only a few individuals or
a small number of groups are suppressed or are de ied their
rights. Liberty is indivisib1e._No man’s freedom is safe as
long as the freedom of another is threatened.

“When one group of our nation loses its rights a pattern
is created which soon destroys the freedom of all who depend
upon civil rights for their continued existence.” '

This pamphlet conﬁned itself to the trade union scope of
the Red-baiting menace. Pamphlets this size, or longer, could
repeat the same story on the Red-baiting menace as it serves
the inciters of a new war and imperialist expansion on the
Truman Doctrine pattern; how it stiﬂes culture and educa-
tion; how it degrades the newspaper profession; how it serves
the anti-Semites and enemies of the Negro people; how it con-
fuses our youth movements; how it prepares America to shift
the burden of the next depression onto the backs of the com-
mon people. .

This weapon must be exposed, fought and made useless for
the enemies of the people. The entire racket built upon it
must besmashed. Unity of labor ranks, and cooperation be-
tween unions and their allies in town and country, is themost
effective answer to it. The unions can well look backto their
early days when they were a house of all trends of thought
among the workers. But no matter how sharp the differences
were, there was a common front against labor’s enemies. The
small labor movement of those days had to be that way to sur-
vive the attacks of a much superior foe.

The labor movement today, although much stronger, needs
that old time unity more than ever. Otherwise it will not be
able to meet successfully the very tough days ahead of it.

  

As American industrialism expanded union-busting became
specialized. The business of spying upon workers, worming

into unions to disrupt them from within or to take control

over them, became a profession. The business of planting
provocateurs in the ranks of strikers to deliberately arrange
violence, forging testimony to frame union leaders, and spread-
ing false rumors and confusion to split or demoralize workers,
became an art_in this profession.

At a later_stage, when unions grew despite all obstacles and
undercover operatives, the business of setting up phony sub-
stitutes for unions—company unions——became a specialty. With
that came the most up-to-date forms of cultivating “loyal
workers”——company stooges——for the Judas role of officials of
c()mpany unions. ’

All of those forms and methods reached a high point during
the post-war twenties. The corporations, aided by servile tools
in the Harding-Coolidge-Hoover administrations of the period,
cut loose with a furious open-shop drive. Injunctions, use of
troops and massacres of strikers, reduced union membership
to some 2,500,000 and wages to starvation levels.

Company-unions thrived during the period, at times em-
bracing more members than those enrolled in the legitimate
unions. The trusts built an iron curtain around mass produc-
tion industries and their company towns. Their propaganda
mill described unions as “foreign ~importations.”l The “Ameri-
can way” was the A“Golden Rule” of management-labor col-
laboration.

We were boastful of our “prosperity” during the 1923-29
period. But wages in manufacturing, at their height in those
days, averaged $26.40 for a week’ that generally ran 48 hours.
It took the crash and unemployment that reached the dizzy
ﬁgure of 17,000,000 at one time, before laws were put on the
books to protect a worker’s right to organize and choose a
union without interference from employers or their spies.

The \/Vagner Act was no sooner on the law-books than new
formulas to smash unions-were devised. The notorious anti-
union formulaof the period was brought forth by the Rem-
ington-Rand Corporation -as aresult of experience at the
company’s Ilion, New York plant during a strike in the sum-

mer of 1936. It was named the Mohawk Valley Formula. This
formula was followed during the “Little Steel” strike of 1937,
in the first General Motors strike and in other struggles that
took the spotlight in those days. The National Association
of Manufacturers popularized the Mohawk plan among its

’member ﬁrms, as the formula for by-passing or nullifying

Wagner Act procedure. The National Labor Relations Board,
summarizing the Mohawk formula, said it called for a nine-
step procedure: a .

1. When a strike threatens, label union leaders as “agi-
tators” and open a campaign through the press and ads pic-
turing the union as a small “minority” that is trying to impose
its will upon the community. Concurrently alarm the com-
munity with threats to move the ‘plant out of town. Form a
“Citizens Committee” of inﬂuential leaders of the community
like bankers, real estate owners, clergymen and business men
who are “aroused” over.the-possible loss of an industry to the
community. The company, in the meantime, should conduct a
poll in the plant through the foremen to “show” the people
that the majority of. the workers “don’t want a strike.”

2. If a strike is called, raise high the banner of “law and
order” and a community-wide hysteria to mobilize legal and
police weapons to meet the imaginary violence.

3. Call a mass meeting of the citizens to display a “public
sentiment” against the strike, and to give the “Citizens Com-
mittee” an opportunity to raise the cry for vigilantes.

4. Bring about the formation of a large police force to
intimidate strikers and thereby exert a psychological effect
upon the community. Call for state troops if necessary and
deputize many in the community.

5. Form a puppet association of “loyal employees” and have
it whip up a publicity campaign under its own name to con-
vince strikers that their cause is hopeless. With the puppet
outﬁt appearing as an “independent” organization, its “mis-
sionaries” should visit the homes of strikers to prepare the
ground for a back-to-work movement. This will help build a
feeling among the people that the strikers are indeed a
minority. The entire strike-breaking program will get general
endorsement and the “public” will even agree to foot the bill.

5

 

   

6. When a sufficient number of scab applications are on
hand, the company should direct the puppet outﬁt to ask for
opening of the plant. The opening date should be set with a
full mobilization of police forces and a display of arms. The

worked up tension and marital law atmosphere may induce_

more strikebreakers.

7. The opening should be staged theatrically. Strikebreakers
should march protected by squads of armed police. A cere-
mony should be arranged-of speeches, ﬂag raising and high
praise for “loyal” -employees and the “civic minded” notables
who have been so helpful.

8. Keep working up a warlike atmosphere to raise the ten-

sion in the community and scare more strikers into returning.
The cause of the strikers is thereby pictured as hopeless. If
necessary the entire community should be barricaded from
the outside world. .

9. The ﬁnal stage of the publicity ‘drive should emphasize
that the plant is in full operation and the “few” strikers still
holding out are only trying to interfere in the “right to work.”
Thus the public is induced to place a stamp of approval on
the entire strikebreaking job. The strike is broken.

Despite widespread application of the above plan and
massacres M like the one in South Chicago that. sent 12 steel
strikers to their graves, the general advance of trade union
organization continued. For the ﬁrst time mass production and
basic industries like steel, automobile, machine and electrical
manufacturing and rubber became unionized. The war period
stimulated the advance to a total union membership of more
than 15,000,000.

The Mohawk Formula was discredited because popular sup-
port swung to labor’s side in many communities. Thedindus-
trialists pinned their hopes, however, on the possibility of a
swing against labor during the reconversion period. They were
thinking of the open shop drive of the twenties. The ﬁrst
test, the great strike wave of the 1945-46 period, disappointed
them sadly. They learned this is not the weak labor movement
they defeated after the last war. Hardly a strike was broken,
hardly a scab was in evidence in the struggles that involved
4,650,000 workers. The stigma of scab became a very odious

one. Unions were, indeed, rooted in American life, the cor-
porations found out. i

The foes of labor learned that the frontal attack on the
twenties pattern will not work-certainly not without a soften-
ing up preparation. Since V] Day the employers, through
their Chamber of Commerce and National Association’ of
Manufacturers, have been shaping a more up-to-date anti-
union strategy. There are three essential features in their
softening up plan.

1. An all-out campaign of smear propaganda to discredit
unions and unionism in the eyes of the general public. As is
well known, the enemies of labor have poured out many mil-
lions of dollars in the recent period to blacken unions in news-
paper ads, publicity, /books, pamphlets and over the radio.
Experts have been working night and day on every conceivable

. way to lay high prices, economic instability, housing shortage,’

unemployment among veterans, and other complaints at the
door of labor. The aim is to condition the minds of the peo-
ple for acceptance of anti-labor measures.

2. A drive for federal and state legislation to both wipe out
laws protecting unions, and to hamstring or wipe out existing
unions. The culminating point of that drive is the Taft-
Hartley Law. The aim is to so weaken unions as to render
them ineffective as ﬁghting organizations. At the same time,
the legislative pattern aims to open wide the door to com-
pany unionism and to bring a condition under which the
industrial spy and company inﬁltration in unions through
agents could again be developed. -

3. A continual campaign to saturate American life with the
“Red scare.” This is the key to the entire strategy against labor.
The Communist Party is only the bullseye. The target is much
wider. It extends to everyone in labor, politics, science, arts
or religion who is even mildly progressive. The basic prin-
ciple of the technique requires continual widening of the
target through the practice of labeling persons and organiza-
tions of a middle-of-the—road character as “Communist.” The
object is to extend the witch-hunting dragnet to spheres and
regions where Communists and Communism are not even
known. ‘

7

 

  

This is why distortion and falsiﬁcation of Communist views
goes hand-in-hand with the technique of Red-baiting. The
propagandists of reaction describe Communists and their
views not as they are but as they’d like them to be seen. After
thus falsely pinning the label of “foreign agent” and “violence

inciter” upon Communists, the Red-baiters tag even a man like A

Henry Wallace with “Communism.” This provides the split-
ting formula for reaction and an opening for interference in
labor, political or other movements chosen. for disruption or
destruction. . ‘ '

Thus it came about that many leaders in the ranks of labor
and other ﬁelds are being referred to as Communists, when
they are not. People in every sphere of life are constantly
being harassed to state publicly whether or not they are
Communists or “fellow travelers.” The dogs of the press, or

‘ those who have them on the leash, do not even pay attention

to denials of membership in the Communist Party. If it suits
their purpose to picture a man as a “Communist,” the press
services, newspaper and radio chains, tell the whole world
that he is. If it suits the real estate lobby to. describe rent-
control as “Communism,” all the advertising power at its
command proclaims it so.

Non-Communist progressives are becoming increasingly
aware that cringing before reaction with denials of Commu-
nist charges, or indulging in Red—baiting to prove the charges
false, is only playing into the hands of the Red-baiters, and
encouraging their methods. As co-chairman Frank Kingdon of
the Progressive Citizens of America (P.C.A.) once told a
Madison Square Garden audience, when they hurl the charge
of Communism “we hug it_ to our hearts.” It proves that those
attacked are ﬁghting progressives, he said.

THERE’S MONEY IN RED-BAITING

The ﬁrst two aspects of the reactionary drive, smearing la-
bor and crippling it through legislation, are only too well
known to most Americans. It is the third——Red-baiting—which
still confuses people and damages seriously the cause of those
who are on the side of progress. V W

Many Americans have become somewhat “immunized”
against Red-baiting poison by experience in several Roosevelt
campaigns when it was dished out in powerful doses against
the late President. Roosevelt had himself denounced the prac-
tice of witch-hunting. He said the Dies (now Thomas Rank_in)
Un-American Committee is engaged in a “sordid” practice.

But reactionaries are counting on deceiving the millions
who have not yet learned the truth, those who forgot it, and

on the birth of a new sucker‘ every minute. Far from diminish- -

ing, Red-baiting has been stepped up to hysterical proportions.

The witch-hunt methods of the Un-American Committee have

become the model for several other Congressional bodies.
The art of Red-baiting has develop-ed into a nationwide

V racket. It is paying off handsomely to thousands engaged in it.

Experts are working full-time to keep the Red-scare alive.
Most newspapers employ at least one Red-baiting expert.
Magazines are always in the market for anti-Communist “ex-
posures.” “Labor relations” has become in large measure the
art of Red-hunting. Special services have blossomed in many
cities to keep employers posted on “Communist -develop-

. ments.” They sell expensive subscriptions for their “conﬁden-

tial” dope sheets. _

Special departments of the National Association of Manu-
facturers and Chamber of Commerce keep their thousands of
employer clients continually reminded about the “threat” of
Communism in their collective bargaining relations. The vast
needs of the Red-baiting racket have also become quite a mar-
ket for the book and pamphlet publishing industry. Poison
pen artists are in a race to supply anti-Soviet and anti-Com-
munist manuscripts. ‘

The monopolist corporations brought this racket into ex-
istence. Now the racket needs no stimulus. It perpetuates itself
and the market for its wares by the most ingenious methods
of keeping the Red-scare blazing continually. When the ﬂames
run low, the Red—baiting‘ industry can always count, on a
couple of magazine articles by  Edgar Hoover on the “Red
menace,” or on a new series of hearings by the House Un-

American. Committee, or a phony atom bomb scare,—or the

arrest of prominent Communists, like Eugene Dennis, or of
