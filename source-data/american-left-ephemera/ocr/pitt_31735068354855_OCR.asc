  Ifiilicres show
S. workers going broke

WA‘SHINGTON—(FP)——-Millions of U.S. workers and their fam-

ilies are either eating up credit, going broke or living substandard
lives, according to the family budget study just released by the Bureau

of Labor Statistics.

The report, designed to show how much it costs the U.S. worker to
maintain himself, his wife andtwo children in a city, showed that in
October, 1951, the cost-was $3,812 a year in New Orleans, La., _and

_$‘4,454_in Washington, D.C.

-These figures, based on'BLS consumer price index rateslnwhich all
organized labor insists fail to reflect the full rise in the cost of living,

reveal even within this limitation rises
of 40% and 50% in the cost of raising
a family between March 1946, when”
the first workers family budget was
published, and October 1951. The BLS
consumer price index itself has risen
from 187.4 in October 1951, date of the .
budget study, to 188 in March 1952, in-
dicating‘ an even greater increase" in “
family living costs.

An idea of how the average worker’s
income can faée up to thishuge in-
crease is obtained by‘ taking the last

published repprt on average weekly '

earnings. This shows that manufactur-
ing workers in February 1952 received
‘average weekly earnings of $67.03. If_
the worker kept his job all year he
would receive 52 times that amount,
which is $3,485.56. , ‘

THIS INCOME is nearly $400 ‘less
than the cost -of maintaining the fam-
ily in the lowest cost city, New Or-
leans, and nearly $1,000 a year less

. than the family living costs in Wash-

ington, according to the family budget
study.

Further insight into the worker’s
budgetary problem is obtained from a
study of what the BLS considers a
“modest but adequate” family. budget
for a breadwinner aged 38, his wife, 36, .
who is a homemaker, a boy, 13, in high
school and a girl, 8, in grade school.

The f.mily lives in a separate 5-
room house or apartment with running
hot and cold ‘water, “at least one
window in each room” and electric

ﬂights. The. wife has a gas‘or electric

stove, "a mechanical gefrigerator and a
washing machine. The family has a
“small; I‘€1dl( ” '

THE FOOD BUDGET.~allows, for
meat “several tinies, a-week,for dinner”
if the cheapest cuts are purchased. For
the-family of four the budget allows
two '5c ice cream cones, one 5c candy
bar, two bottles of soft drinks and one
bottle of beer each week.

The lrsband isyallowed one heavy
wool suit every two years, one light
wool sui. every three years, and five
shirts and two pairs of shoes each year.
The wife gets one heavy wool ‘coat
every four years, four dresses and three
pairs of shoes a year. The boy gets one
sweater or jacket, two pairs of pants,

V three shirt." and three pairs of shoes

each year. The girl gets one snowsuit
or heavy coat every two years, four
dresses and four ‘pairs of shoes each
year. ‘

The family buys one daily and Sun—_
day newsparer and 32 copies of some
magazine each year, butlno books. “A.-
telephone ll the dwelling is not re-
quired,” the BLS says, but allowance
is made for three, local phone calls a
week. No automobileiis included, but
provisior is made for public transpor-
tation Lo work and school and one trip
out of town for a vacation or visit
“every three or four years.” Provision
for medical, dental care and insurance
is at a miI»imum.

LABOR LEADERS pointed out that
with yearly income far below even
these meager standards, the best .a
family car. ‘do is send the mother to
work and leave the children without

, adequate supervision or housekeeping.

Variations in. housing costs were the
chief elemen; in differing costs among
the 34 cities stﬁdied. Housing costs
ranged fror $581 a year in New Or-

-leans. to $1,034 in -Washington. Al-

though heating cost was included in
housing, the housing cost in Houston,
Tex., the warmest ‘city studied, was
higher than in Milwaukee, Wis.,‘ the
coldest. /-

cost still rising

WASHINGTON——The' overall cost of ‘living is still going -up, in
spite of all the phony claims in the newspapers that prices have been

dropping.

The U. S. Deria1~tment of Labor’s cost-of-living index released last
week showed another increase during the period from March 15 1:6
April 15. The new, jump brought the cost of livingto, a point just a
shade under the all—time. high reached late last fall.

The increase in costs was "greatest _in food, the most important
single item in the worker’s budget. Next in order. were rents, which
rose another fraction, followed by the so-called “miscellaneous” group.

The old consumers price index of the Labor Department rose 1.2
points,,/reflecting the true importance of food inlthe cost-of—living. The
new, more..distorted index, showed the increase at seven-tenths of a

point. I ~

Despite the increase marked in both indeKx/ts, however, a_ million

turned to work at the end of last week,
following settlements around a 15—cent
h_ourly wage increase. The Wage Sta-
bilization Board had ruled, in a.»-test.

" case after the strike began, that‘ 15

cents was thetop amount it would ap-
prove.“ The CIO Oil Workers Union

“reluctantly” agreed to sign contracts"

based on that figure. It

Meantime, the AFL Coinmercial Te-
legraphers Union signed an agreement
with Western» Union aimed at settling
a 51-day strike. of 30,000 WU em-
ployes. The big” “if” attached to the
agreement meant that,the wage in-
creases ‘were ‘tied to the requirement
that Western Union get a rate increase
from the Federal Communications
Commission.

THE WESTERN UNION settlement
called for a reduction in the gworkweek
from 4§,to 40 hours with no cut in
weekly pay for workers hired before
November '1, 1941, and a 10 cent hourly
increase x for other employees now
working on a 40 hour"week. The con-
tract, which raises messenger wages 5
cents an hour, runs for two years.

The Brotherhoods of! railroad en-
gineers,ifiremen and condu‘ctors signed
‘/‘with some disappointment” a govern-
rnent formula for ending their 3-year-
old dispute with the nation’s major

“there are no better alternatives under
one-sided government seizuire and rule
by labor injunction.” ‘

, The, settlement formula was much '

the same as one worked ‘out at the
White House more than a year ago
and rejected by the rank. and file. The

Rail union officials said '

ten determines the length of a work-
er’s day. I _
Wage provisions were exactly the
same as those turned ‘down 1' earlier.
Roadmen received a 22% cents hourly
increase and yardmen 37 cents. These
figures included tiny increases granted
by the Army after it “took over” the
roads in August, 1950.-~.The railroad

workers involved are due to‘ get. back '

Alnericans. Canadians want, peace,

Here are some more signs of the
growing desire of Americans and Ca-
nadians for peace;

0 The Gallup Poll of Canada reports

that three out of five Canadians yearn
‘most for headlines reporting peace in

\. Korea andagreement with the Soviet

Union. Of people asked what headliner
they wanted most to see, 59% said
“p‘€ace." Next in order were 9% want-
ing “a drop in_ living costs;” 4% want-
ing “reduction in taxes.”

OJacob Potofsky, president of the
CIO Amalgamated Clothing Workers,
told 'the recent convention of his un-
ion that the socialist and capitalist‘
—worlds can live in peace with “more;
negotiations‘ and more understanding.”£-

—O The top officers. of the AFL Meat
Cutters & Butcher Workmen have is-
sued a call, in the May issue of the
union’s paper, for a big power peace

,_ conference. Such a ‘meeting, they say,
--should be held now “come hell or high
; water.”

The AFL union heads said
they believe the U. S. and U. S. S. R.
can live peacefully in thesame-.world.

0 Hugo Ernst, president ‘of the AFL
Hotel & Restaurant Workers has also
issued a call for big power meetings to
pave the way to world peace.

0 Also plugging for steps toward
peacewere the delegates to the recent
CIO United Packinghouse Workers,
convention. in Denver, who adopted a
strong peace resolution. -

I _mith management May 5 to complete
_ bargaining and on that _day settled a.

number of outstanding differences-but
not all.1\Before the May 5 session broke
up, another conference was scheduled
for May 12.

But on May 8 the company advised

the union that it would be impossible ‘I

.10 meet again ‘before May '15. The’
workers were not -. satisfied with that,
so they decided that on May 12 every_
employe of the plant would wait out-
side the gates at the end of their shifts.

THEY ALSO decided that encTugh.
timehad passed since the expiration of \

their old contract on January 21 to ’

complete negotiations on anew con-
tract. They agreed that unless the ne-
gotiations reached a successful conclu-
sion on.May 12, no one‘ would report
for work May 13.

The union urged the company to have
its representatives available on May
12 ‘so that bargaining could be resumed.
But the company thought it could con-
tinue to negotiate. at its own leisure,
and again refused to meet with the-
union ‘M: 12. -1

As early as 6 a. m. May 13, almost ’ .

every worker was at the gates of the
plant and a number were carrying
signs.

The lines were organized and com-
mittees settup. Large pots of coffee

gvwere soon smoking over red coals and

3:" feeling of comradeship never before
fc-lt between Thﬁ. workers at is plant
was developed. -There was good- music
furnished by the entertainment com-
mittee. ~

NOT A WHEEL turned within the 0

plant._ So beforei long the” company‘
agreed to meet, and by late in the aft-
ernoon of the next day, Thursday, com-
plete agreement had been reached on a
new contract. .
The new contract assures a large
amount of money in back pay, and a 10
cents an hour general wage increase. _
This work stoppage resulted in vic-
tory only because’ both the white and

Negro workers at the plant banded to- '

gether 100% to meet the company“
headon. A shop. steward and officers’

training program is now being set up .

An all-out squabble between the AFL

/_"and CIO over‘ affiliation of hundreds

of thousands of textile workers in the

U. S. and Canada was already well
,0 started last week.

The inter—union raiding was formally

V —- heralded when George Baldanzi led his

supporters out of the CIO Textile
Workers into the rival AFL Textile
Workers. Baldanzi, who lost his fight
against Emil Rieve for the presidency
at the recent CIO Textile .nion con-
, vention, predicted that within the next
year 100,000 workers will join him in
the AFL.
Baldanzi said about 53,000 members

‘  of the CIO union already have seceded

or would do so shortly and then added

_that he expected to pull away 100,000

in all from the TWUA. This claim was
ridiculed by Rieve, who said: “If they
take away from us, one—quarter “the
number they estimate, they’ll be doing
well.” ~
TWO-TJIRDS of the estimated 1,-

 ‘ , 250,000 textile workers in the U. _S. are

'\

4’ " Maryland, for the 7‘full package”

unorganized, because of company-union
pol’icies_,followed by Rieve and Baldanzi
A and their failure to win any real gains

 since the end’ of World War II.

The break /between Rieve. and Bal-

   

.n.; ..n... c .0 
inf textile industry

danzi came after several years in which
both had been struggling for power

within the CIO union. There was no
real disagreemeigt between“ them on

A important issues of policy.

M. E. Travis, Int’l isecretary-treas-
urer of Mine-Mill,
“The fact that Baldanzi is now play-
ing the par? of can.nibal in a frenzied
attempt to tear apart the union he

called his 9wn up to a month ago could .

have been predicted. It follows" from
the raiding policies which both he and
Rieve have been supporting in National
CIO for f've years now. V .

“When thieves —falL_ out,” Travis
added, “it doesn’t take long before they
start stealing from each other. Back in
1947, when the reactionary_ CIO unions
began raiding Mine-Mill and other pro-
gressive unions, we predicted that it
wouldn’t be long before these same
rhiders would be eating eachiother up.
Now, unfortunately, our predictions are
coming true.
‘ “The regrettable and dangerous part
about all thisis that the textile work-
ers are "cleft to suffer, ‘defenseless
against determined onslaughts from the
textile employers.”

Employer publications in both U. S. and Canada last week‘ were
gloating over the blundering misleadership of the United Steelworkers.

‘ One was US. News & World: Report,

HONOLULU; T. H.—The brand of Americanism which the NAM

‘ “and other reactionary bodies have been trying to peddle in recent years

just isn’t the real article. It’s a fake.  \ . I .
That’s what you find out when you thumb your way through a new

pamphlet, “Americahdsm,” published by the Int’l Longshoremen’s & Ware-

housemen’s Union in Hawaii. The pamphlet goes back. -to the genuine,

honest-to.-g‘ood:ness sourcesto remind us what this word Americanism_

means. .
There is the late Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who

once wrote: “Surely it cannot show ldclc of ‘dttachment to the .principles_
‘of therConstitution that she thinks it can be improved. I suppose that

most intelligent people. think that it might be.” ~

" There is/the late Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said: “Of course we
will continue every effort to end monopoly in business, to supportlcollec-
tive bargaining, to stop unfair competition, to abolish dishonorable trade

: practices. For all these we have only just begun to fight.” ' -
AGAIN ROOSEVELT pointed out that immigrants, as well a

others, are aften falsely attacked as “communists.” He said: “It is a
source of regret to all decent Americans that some political propagandists

are now dragging red herrings across the trail of this national election...

“For example, labor baiters and bigots and some politicians use the
term ‘communism’ loosely, and apply it to every progressive social‘meas-
ure and to the views of every foreign-borncitizen with whom they dis-

aagree. They forget that we in the ,United States are all descended from
immigrants (all except the /Indians); and there is no better proof of the
fact than the heroic -names on our casualty lists.”

Then there was Frederick Douglass, the great Negro leader of Civil
War days, who said: “Let me give you a word of the philosophy of

reforms. The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that _.

all concessions yet made to her august °claims, have been born of earnest
struggle. The conflict has been exciting, agitating, all-absorbing, and
for the time being putting all other tumults ‘to silence. It must do this
or it does‘ nothing. If there is no struggle there is no progress?” ‘

AND SO ON down the long listiofilluistrious Americans who have
spoken out on the ‘many—sided meaning of Americanism-—Thomas Jeffer-
son, William Cullen Bryant, Senator Robert. F. Wagner, Abraham Lincoln,
Wendell Willkie, Henry David Thoreau, Woodrow Wilson.

What they ‘had to say was genuine, true, not the synthetic fake

which the enemies of America are now trying to sell us.

The ILWU ‘pamphlet is worth reading, It’s a refresher on the
“American way‘of life.” Copies of the pamphlet may be gotten by writ-

Acouse Jess Larson 4 
in misconduct case    

The man who last fall was put in,
charge of all government purchasesggof  
_non-ferrousmetals has now been ac;  ‘
cused of “misconduct” on a» contract,”  
deal and of niaking long distance calls g  ‘
to Frank Nathan, Pittsburgh gambler, 
on his private phone. _. ,0  ‘ I

The man is Jess Larson, director of.
the Defense Materials Procurement‘ 3
Agency. His deputy in they agencyeis  
Howard I. Young, president of Amer-
ican Zinc Co. T f: —  

The facts about the phone calls’ to .. Hi,
Frank Nathan were put in the record  C ,
of the House subcommittee investigat- 
ing tax scandals. Nathan has been 
named by Abraham Teitelbaum, Chi- E
"cage attorney for Capone gangsters, ‘as
one of" two men who tried to» shake
‘himjdown-for $500,000 to fix"h1s tax
‘fraud liability through their claimed ..
influence with an. alleged clique of '*
Washingtdn officials said to have in-,
cluded Jess Larson. ‘ V! ‘ —

NATHAN T/OLD the House subcom-Q
mittee he had received no phone calls
from Larson during 1951. Then the
Adrian DeWind, , 
reading from phone company records  ;. it
of a private, unlisted phone in Larson’s ‘
government office for which Larson is
billed personally, read off a list of per-
son-to-person calls made to Nathan last ' 
“June and July. ii‘ , . J —  i

_ There were six calls in June, lasting ‘ L '  “
from four to 10 minutes each. In July 
there were four calls. The testimony.-
took on special significance in view of
Larson’s recent testimony in whichyhe,
denounced Nathan and said he had
tried to avoid him since 1948, when he _
found that Nathan was ’/misusing, his ‘
name ‘in’ oil promotions.

Nathan was asked if he,received any V
phone calls from Larson’s home in the . H ‘ A
evening. Nathan said he did a couple of V
years ago when they were joint partici- --
pants in oil ventures, but none in 1951_1 ’
that he could ‘recall.

Meantime, "the same Jess Larson was A
‘charged with “connivance and collu- , 
sion”' in negotiating with _a California  r"
firm for construction of a multi-million

  Organize for peace L

‘ To the Editor:
In adopting a resolution on Peace at

"our Local Union Convention recently,
v we recognized that this was only the ,

first step. The mere passing of the
. resolution would not bring World Peace

A, -—the next step must be to organize
‘ and to work for Peace by setting up a _

Peace Committee" in‘ our Local.

' We as trade unionists realize that
peace. is the most important issue fac-
ingthe American people today. One of

 the’ best -ways We can strengthen our

Union is by a strong rank and file
Peace Committee. ’

Welin L. A. are suffering the effects
of the war. economy, as are workersin

‘_e_very._.part of the A; country. ., We have V

been hit by layoffs and cutbacks as a
result of curtailment of civilian pro-
duction. At Universal Brass, a plant
normally employing f.rom 60_ to 80

Workers, personnel was cut over 50%. -

This _plant manufactures plumbing
' equipment. __ Another example‘ is Sho_re
Metals, which makes auto accessories.
"Normally Shore employs about 40
workers. Today there are only 8 left.
‘We believe war and depression go
hand in hand.- We refute the state-
ments made by the NAM and Cham-
ber of Commerce‘ that warswill bring
full employment and prosperity to the
American people. We charge that the

 smokescreen created by the war econ-

omy is being used by the bosses to
A break our Union and to eliminate the
gains we have made down through the
years. . ‘
* We will not be intimidated by the
Smiths, McCarrans, McCarthys ~ or
. Humphreys. We will continue to work
for peace. We are not alonegin this

fight for peace. . We have the over- I

whelming majority of the peoples of
the World on ourside. .We’ already
‘know the‘ outcome. The only question
iis_§,How long will it take? Brothers

.. -and Sisters—you will decide.
iWe will keep, you informed of. our”

peace activities. As a beginnng I am
"enclosing a copy". of the minutes from
our: first ‘meeting. In return, we would
like to know _what is happening in
other unions on this question..

TIMMIN S, Ont. — Mine-Mill Auxil-
iaries across Canada have been ‘unus-
ually busy in recent weeks, according
to Dorothy McDonald’s “Auxiliary
News-Letter” for May. ~

Port Cqlborne Auxiliary 136 has been
making donations to the Institute of
the Blind, the Crippled Children’s Fund,
the March of Dimes. The same Aux-

iliary also sent an Easter parcel to-

their little girl in the Children’s Hos-
pital in Toronto. And more recently
it conducted a very successful rummage
sale. ‘

4 The Sudbury Auxiliary reports that
its group in Levack now has a mem-
bership of 73, and it has set up a new
group in Carson with Doreen Crisante
as secretary. The lively Sudbury ladies
are planning to organize a nursery

‘ - school and plan to send one of their

members to Toronto to take the nursery
school supervisor’s course. I

The Rossland group, of the Trail Aux-
iliary is looking forward to moving into
the newly-purchased hall which Local
480 bought. It’s the hall in which the
old Rolssland lo'cal’of the Western Fed-
eratio/1J- of Miners met more than 40
years ago. The ‘Auxiliary recently had
its annual tea and bazaar.

, Shipbuildling worliers
certified in Nova Scotia

It is more than a year now since the
Nova Scotia Labour Board ruled that
six locals of the Marine & shipbuilding
Workers of Canada could not be certi-
fied as collective bargaining represen-.
tative. The ‘argument used by the
Board was that the Marine Workers

._ took positions on political issues; there-

fore they could not be considered a
uniﬁ ,

Now the Nova Scotia Supreme Court
has finally acted to throw out the un-
democratic decision of the Labour

Board. The Court has ruled th-at the-

Labour Board acted “beyond its pow-

.ers” when it denied certification to the

marine union in Dartmouth, Lunen-
burg, Picton and Liverpool shipyards.
This means the union must be certi-
fied as the collective bargaining agent
for the men working in those yards.
When the Labour Board handed
down its original decision, the entire

Canadian labour movement recognized

the dangers in it. They saw that this
could be used as a device for destroy-
ing any union.’ ,,

At stake in the case was the right
of workers-to join the ‘union of their

. own choice and to elect anybodynthey .

wanted as officers of . their union. The

Supreme Court decision is therefore it

the government to increase its stock-'- 3. . . . ‘ .

  AUXILIABIES

 

Dorothy McDonald, Canadian Chair-
man of Mine—Mill Auxiliaries -has an
article in the latest issue of the -WFTU
“Fortnightly Review.” It tells the sig-
nificant story of how Mine—Mill women
have fought in support of their men
and their union. _ . I *

‘ Starting withthe Kirkland Lake
strike of 10 years ago, the article re-

' views the historicpart played by wom-

en of Mine—Mill Auxiliaries in hard-
fought strikes and struggles against
raiders in both Canada and the United
States since then.

Special credit is; given Mine—Mill
women for their tremendous contribu-
tions, at Kirkland Lake, Sudbury, Port
Colborne, Noranda, Timmins, East St.
Louis, Trail, Carlsbad, _and Bayard.

f‘These are the most important strug-
gles which Mine - Mill has passed
through during the past decade. There
were many lesser fights, but all of
them were im'portant, too,” Mrs. Mc-

‘ ponald writes.

_ “The women of Kellogg and Hailey,‘
Idaho, the women of Sunrise-Hartville,’
Wyoming, of Rodeo and Selby, Califor-

nia all backed their men‘-folk to the

hilt when it “came to a showdown‘ with

the companies or the raiders.”

Tariff goes back
on imported lead

The tariff on all imported lead was
set to go into effect at 1.06 cents a
pound at the end of May. This is auto-
maticvunder the law which provides
that whenever the domestic price of
lead remains below 18'cents for 30
days, the tariff must be slapped back
on. ~ \~ .

At the moment, lead has fallen to

15 cents a pound as the result of three ,

developments I

OiThe home market has fallen off
because taxes and higher prices have
cut down on sales of durable goods.

" /Fewer automobiles‘, batteries and other

lead-using products are being sold. ’

O The market in West Europe-is de-
pressed because of a lack of dollars
as a result of heavy rearmaments.

OThe market in East Europe is
closed entirely because q£_ the “cold
war” policies of the U. S. government.

The imposition ofthe‘ tariff on im-
ported leadwas expected to help. steady
the‘ market on __Uv.S...—produced lead. So-
was the recent removal of credit re-
strictions. And company pressure, on

DEFEAT SMITH BILL

The House armed services committee

has been considering the Smith bill—'- .'

ong, of the worst anti-labor measures
to come before Congress in recent
years . . . The Smith bill would invite

injunctions inidevery strike situation. A‘

. It blueprints interference by the courts

in strikes. It would penalize unions, re-
gardless of the justice of their de-'
mands; and by giving the courts power

to place “receivers” in control of their, 

property, it threatens to disrupt them
or bankrupt them, or both . . . The
House, in a state of‘- hysteria and
sloganeering, may act on itrsoon. But
before that happens, a mighty wave of
protest should come from union mem-
bers across ' 1erica—a protest against
reckless, unthinking bills that can ruin.

SEIZURE

Although it was not developed in
court, the seizure had the cffectof,
causing steelworkersto abandon their

strike plans and thus remove any pres- .

sure on the companies to accept ‘the
wage decisioin. .In this respect the
steelworkers are in a position simila/r
to that of railroad workers whose wage
case has been stalled for 21/; [years by
government seizure, while raillroad

BXYARD, N. M. —— Amalgamated

sent out invitations to a banquet June I

The invitation, signed by Mrs. Vir- I ‘I

the fact that June 13 is the anniver-
sary of the day on which »“union wives
of the district took over the E-Z picket

“We urgently request that you con-

sider our invitation, and see if it will '

be possible for you to join us in honor-

the Empire Zinc lines for 15 long""“i—

months in the face of every kind of

writes’. The banquet on the evening of
