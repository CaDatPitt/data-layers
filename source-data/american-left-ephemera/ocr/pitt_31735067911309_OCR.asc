C  Steel Union routed!

1 WE WI N r 5

By Henry Horowitz

GREAT FALLS, Mont.—Three smashing victories

- rolledup by Mine-Mill rank-and-filers in Montana within
the space of four days spelled an effective finish to a
15-month CIO-Steel raiding campaign against this union

in this state.

In NLRB elections earlier this month, workers at
the Great Falls smelter and refinery of Anaconda Copper
and at the AS&R company’s East Helena smelter,

r snowed the CIO raiders under a ‘mountain of Mine-Mill

yotes.

» 0 At Great Falls, workers went to the polls May 7th
- . and rolled up a vote of 734 forthe Great Falls Mill &
Smeltermen’s Local 16 as against 287 for the Steel
raiders. Voting was heavier than that recorded in any
' balloting in local union history, topping even this year’s
earlier‘ NLRB union shop election.
0 At East Helena, just two days later (May 9th), the
Mill & Smeltermen’s Local 72 beat back Steel’s attempt E
to split it away from MMSW and its National AS&R
Council by piling up a vote of 186 to Steel’s 67.

O’\On the following day, May 10th, the knockout blow

was delivered to the CIO raiders when a last desperate

maneuver to “save face” boom-
eranged and forced the with-
°drawal of Steel’s election petition
under direct threat of having it
summarily dismissed by the
NLRB for “insufficient evidence
of interest.” I

every new wrinkle and smear-tactic de-
veloped by its high-salaried publicity
and advertising experts.

Dozens of CIO-Steel orgnizers, led
by Phil Murray’s “personal representa-
tive,” Nick Zonarich, trooped into Mon-
tana from all points of the compass.
Some were quickly yanked when their
personal records and bar-room behavior
threatened to involve CIO-Steel in com-
munity-wide scandal. Others dug in
and hibernated in plush ‘headquarters,
established in the most expensive hotel
suites and office buildings available.

During the final weeks before the
elections, Steel l_aid down a publicity
barrage that had newspaper and radio
advertising managers rubbing their
hands in joy. Four-a-day radio pro-
grams, full double-page “spreads” ad-
vertising “CIO-Steel, an American un-
Ion,”- and scab-printed two-color news-

apers and throw-aways werethrown

total of 354 votes were all the Murray __
‘ clique.-had to show for the huge expen-

diture—354 votes out of the nearly 12,-
000 Mine-Mill members they had vowed
to take over in Montana.

THIS WAS N O flash-in-the-pan raid,
initiated on the spur of the moment
simply to harrass MMSW. It was a
long-range drive, blueprinted well in
advance to wreck the half-century-old
Mine-Mill locals of Montana and take

over the state’s basic labor movement in

the name of Phil Murray’s “labo”i'
front.” *-

What accounted for the smashing de-
feat handed CIO-Steel all along the

line? What enabled Mine-Mill to grind’

this lavishly financed raiding machin-
ery into the ground?

It was the fact that Mine-Mill’s de-
fense against the raiders wasa rank-
and-file campaign from start to fin-
ish. Membership mobilization in de-
fense of their union and their bargain-
ing program—a factor the CIO-Steel
crew was helpless to cope with—was

TRAIL, B. C.——The CIO Steel
Union’s desperate attempt to use
legal trickery in its raid against
Mine-Mill Local 480 here has
been tossed out by the British
Columbia Labor Board.

The Board’s decision, the sec-
ond" in 12 months, was accom-
panied by a stinging rebuke to
the Steelworkers union for at-
tempting to win certification at
the CM&S smelter——largest zinc
smelter in the world—by fraudu-
lent means. ‘

Referring to the phony mem-
bership cards submitted by the
Steel union in support of its
claim, the ruling pointed to the
fact that sworn evidence had
been introduced to prove that 445
of these cards had been repudi-
ated. And it added: ’

“The board does not think it
ought to recognize a person as a
member in good standing of a
local union. where the member is
supposedly made a member con-
trary to the expressly statecl
rules of the ( C10 Steel) constitu-

G

tion and bylaws and allegedly be- .

comes a member only by special
dispensation of the president or
scoretary-treasurer of the union,

as to fees and dues.

“Besides the specificelegal re-
quirements, such membership is
contrary to good trade union
practice and will inevitably lead,
not-to incllust-7'-ial peace, but to
union warfare.” '

The Board asserted that Steel

‘THIS week news spread through our International Union about the

I victories won over the raiding top leadership of the Steelworkers

Uni-on. These victories—five of them in a row—were more than a.
series of new milestones in‘the history of our union; they were vic-
tories over the filthy and insidious propaganda concocted by raiding
union leaders and representatives. ' ‘

    
  
 
  

- In every case, the victory. was
decisive--in Tacoma, Washing-

ton, in‘ Great Falls, East Helena ,

and Anaconda, Montana, and in
Trail, British Columbia.
It’s now moge than 18 months
since Philip Murray gave the sig-
’ . nal for the open-
‘ ing assault by the
Steel union raiders
on Mine-Mill.
There are several
conclusions that
can be drawn from
the decisive way
in which our mem-

    

’ 953 -.w —r

bership threw the raiders back
on their heels in these recent
glections. Actually, we didn’t
defeat the Steel union, so much
as the Steel union defeated
itself. ~ 7‘ .

First of all, word has gotten

complete failure of the Steel
Union to fight on grievances, no
matter how large, no matter how
long-standing. A

ANOTHER MASS OF FACTS has been dug out, despite the cloud
of -secrecy which the Steelworkers sought to throw up, to expose the
terrible weaknesses‘ in the contracts negotiated from on highby Phil

in l\'Iurray’s book, “Organized Labor
and Productidn.”

. And they had also read Murray’s

accordingly.
* * _*  

_ THIRD, THE WORD has been spread about—- the failure of these raiders,» to
complete the organization of. their ownindustry! Thirty—five per cent of all the
steel workers. in this countryare employed. in the Pittsburgh area, and yet only
half of the workers are organized. Within sight of Phil Murray’s own office,

there are more than 50,000 workers in unorganized Pittsburgh steel plants! Mesta
Machine Co., with more than 6,000 workers——why doesn’t Murray ‘organize it?

millmen and smeltermen knew wheat «

  

Wierton Steel Co., fourth largest producer in the country—why can’t Murray

organize it? .

And yet Murray has spent more than
$400,000 on the west coast alone just
in raiding Mine-Mill! What a sordid
story! The campaigns conducted by
-these gangsters typified their aban-
donment of decent trade. unionism and
the adoption of smear, goonism and
every despicable trick in the book as
their stock in trade‘.

The kind of deceit they practiced in
Anaconda was a perfect example, com-
monplace for’Steel union leaders. They
petitioned for air election just as the
campaign in Great Falls and East
Helena reached a climax. And their
petition was «limited to production work-
ers only. It was an obvious propaganda
move, intended to influence the elec-

tions at Great Falls and East Helena. 1

  
 
 
  
 
  

  

  

BUT WHEN THOSE ELECTIONS
were over and. Steel had to appear
before the NLRB to back up its An-
aconda petition, they suddenly shifted
ground. They broadened the petition

_ to include craft workers-——knowing they

would be forced by the NLRB to with-
drawthe petition, thereby saving—their
faces from another lost election.

.A. similar sordid story can be toldlat

Labor. Board refused to consider the
spurious appeal of the Stealers and re-
confirmed the Trail smelterwoijkers of

v Steelltries to block the Utah  

MAGNA, Utah. —— CIO-Steel
agents here moved last week to
block an NLRB election — for
which they themselves had orig-
inally petitioned——at the Kenne-
cott Copper ore-reduction mills
here and at nearby Arthur, Utah.

Obviously scared to death by_
the beatings handed them in sim-
ilar.elections this month by Mine-
Mill _members at Tacoma, Great

— Falls and East Helena, tl_ie,CIO-

Steel officials refused- last Mon-
day to consent to an immediate

election after all other parties
involved had done so.
Steel’s bluff on the petition was
called within a matter of hours after
Kennecott management had notified
MMSW’s Arthur-Magna Mil1men’s Local
"392 that.it intended to use the CIO—Steel
election petition as an excuse for stall-
ing 1951 wage and eontract negotia-
tions. . _
‘NOTIFIED of the company’s move,
the 1,400 MMSW millmen walked off

"their jobs Wednesday afternoon, May-

9th, until high-ranking Kennecott offi-
cials agreed to meet with Local and In-
ternational representatives to further
“explain” their position._ i

It was this demonstration which led
directly. to the exposure of Steel’s
claims of “wanting an early election”- as
just so _much ogwash. For as the re-
sult 9f the wa kout, management agreed
lo withdraw its previous objections t_o
a “consent” election immediately, and
joined Mine-Mill in asking the NLRB
for an election without delay. The
[BEW (AFL), also involved in the ‘elec-
tion picture, consented as well. That

, left agreement for an- election to break

the negotiations deadlock squarely up
to the Steelworkers.

After several days"delay, the NLRB

and conciliation men were notified that '

Steel .would ‘not consent to an election
—-despite the fact that Steel itself had
originally petitioned for it!- Steel Imb-
licity‘ men were at that very moment
grinding out claims that “Mine-Mill is
delaying the election.” p . p '

JUST ONE WEEK from the first
stoppage, a second spontaneous “lawn
party” was called by the millmen- It
was the ‘rank-and-file’s own answer to
statements of the conciliators that they
‘-could not re-enter the situation unless
-vital - copper production was ‘actually
halted. By thus involving the concilia-
tors once again, the MMSW millmen
sought to bring additional pressure to

s 0 bear on V.nationalLabor Board officials 
in Washington for an immediate elec-

 order. . l 3

   i/A Call for conciliation in
 Kirkland Lake wage dispute

,.

ion’s case,.»was presented by Local 240
president Barney McGuire.

MINERS throughout this area were
shocked at the revelation that Steel’s
contract in Timmins contains a clause
showing that Timmins miners are re-
ceiving only a 3 cents an hour “cost-of-
living” bonus, as compared to the 10
cent hourly .“interim” hike won by
Kirkland‘,Lake miners.

The Steel “paymaster” contract at
Timmins, contains the following clause
on page 23, Article 18 on wages:’ “The
Company agrees to pay a new cost of
living bonus commencing at a cost of
living index of 161.9" and continuing
until ‘the‘cost of living index reaches
167.7. This is in effect a cost_ of living
bonus up to a maximum of three (3)
cents per hour.” ’

responsible for driving the raiders out
of Montana’s key locals.

‘ The defeat of Steel began long before
the Great Falls and East Helena work-
ers went to the polls two’ weeks ago- It
started more than a year ago, when
Murray's gang was driven out’ of‘ the
city of Butte as 5,000 members of Butte
Miners Union Local 1, and the Bliltte
Stationary Engineers Local 83, slam-
med the doors of their homes and their
union hall on the raiders and told
them to “get out.” 7

MIN E-MILL STAFF members, under

In Butte, the Central Trades and Labor.
_Assembly put itself on‘ record more
than a year ago as taking its stand with
the two Butte Mine-Mill locals.

In Great Falls, the Trades and Labor

it just a few days before the election
with a public statement against the
raiders which appeared as a paid news-
paper advertisement in all local papers.
And in Anaconda, the AFL craft unions
in all parts of the smelter pledged
MMSW Local 117 their support in any
activity necessary to defeat the CIO
raid.

ficers, became an integrated part of
every local union in the state, ‘assist-
ing rank-and-file. leaders and commit--»
tees in developing the anti-raiding
campaign behind which the membership
was mobilizing.

Committees from every major Mon-
tana local were assigned by their own
membership to take an active part in
the anti-raiding drive in the two elec-
tion areas. Butte Miners Local 1 and
the Anaconda.M&S Local 117 sent full-
time teams into Great Falls and East
Helena, to work‘ with local leadership
there in the final days of the pre-elec- ._ '4
tion campaign. ~.

Shop steward bodies, grievance com-
mittees and local union executive boards
formed the «nucleus of the union de-
fence campaign in each local, working
at. the same time to expand the every-
day on’-the-job activities that brought
new grievance gains and protection to
the membership. C

And in every area attacked by the
CIO-Steel,raiders,‘all other sections of
the labor movement joined forces with
Mine-Mill to defeat the -Murray raids.

in the neck again-
 WASHINGTON (FP)—Lower and
middle’ income earners will ‘catch it
in the pocketbook again in ‘proposals
for new federal taxes tentatively
adopted by the House ways- and means
committee.

The, committee adopted legislation

   

increasing individua_l- income taxes by '

$2.95 billion ‘a year and corporation

taxes by” $2 billion. No action was tak-
en on the excess profits~tax.- 

The proposed law would increase in-
dividual income taxes by a straight
"three percentage point»in each bracket,
thus. placing the heaviest percentage
increase on lowest incomes. It would
raise the load on small taxpayers to
the heaviest point reached in .World
War II while leaving the load on cor-

I porate profits much lighter.

The annual tax bill of a single per-
son making $800 a year would be
boosted from $40 to’ $46; making $3,000
a year from $360 to $414; and making
$100,000 a year from $66,798 to $69,-

The bill of a married person with
two dependents would be increased as
follows: making $3,000 .a year, .._ from
$120 to $138; ‘making $5,000 a year,
from $520 to $598; and making $100,-
000 a year, from‘ $51,912 to ‘$54,840.

 

19517 prom   flow

NEW YORK (FP)——Like, ancient

0 ‘King .. Midas, whose magic, changed

whatever he touched into gold, big
business transformed the sweat and

"hard labor of its vemployes into a

record-breaking flow of prdfits in the
first three months of this year.
Barron's financial weekly, admitted
that‘ with some exceptions, “all indus-
try seemed to have the touch of Midas
in January, February and March.”
Business Week reported: “U.S. cor-

_ porations had their hands on more

profits in the first quarter of 1951
than ever before.” Discussing dividend
payments May 5, the same magazine
said: “The first three months of 1951
saw the golden flow reach‘ the highest
levels everrecorded ind first quarter.”

Industry gave what Barron's called
its “brilliant performance”_,,despite the
new excess profits tax. Before taxes,
corporate profits hit an annual rate of
$48 billion in the first ‘quarter this
year, compared to a $29.2 billion rate
in the similar 1950 quarter.

After taxes, first _quarter 1951“pro-_

fits were at. an annual rate of $23 bil- "

lion, a $7 billion increase over the simi-
lar-. 1950 «period.

  Wage boardis loaded on
gthelssidge of~big business

. members of the

President Truman has named the 17
newly-reorganized
Wage Stabilization Board to serve with
chairman George Taylor. ‘
A.glance at the list of labor, indus-

: ‘try and “public” members shows that

the Board ..is” -heavily loaded against
labor’ and in favor of big business. It

also shows that. it is the kind of board '

that will go out of its- way to make
things hard for unionsfthat really fight
for the rights of their members.

The “labor” members of the board
includes men with a weak record of
fighting for their own members’ in-
terests. And.-_-.the “public” members of
the boardhave a record of siding with
industry and business much more often
than with labor. ’

TO REPRESENT_ labor, Truman
named the ‘six men : previously nomi-
nated by the AFL and CIO: from the
AFL, president Harry Bates, bricklay-
ers; vice president Elmer Walker, ma-
chinists; and President William Birth-
right, barbers; from ...the ‘CIO, presi-
dent Emil Rieve, ‘textile workers; presi-
dent ‘Joseph Beirne, communications
workers; and vice president John Liv-
ingston, auto workers. 7

From industry, -the new members _

are: Milton Olander of Owens-Illinois’
Glass Co.; Alexander Heron of the
Crown-Zillach Paper, Co., California;
and Richard Doherty of the National
Association of Broadcasters. The fol-
-lowing are holdovers from the ‘old

 ‘fraudulent’ living, cost index

‘WASHINGTON, D. _C.——Two Mine-
Mill local union presidents and Mine-
Mill board members were ,scheduled to
testify on the increase in living costs
before a House Labor subcommittee

last Friday as THE UNION went to“

press. /

Thomas Lane, president of Local 365
in Perth Amboy, N. J., and Ray Dowd,
president of Local 423 in Torrington,
were prepared to give testimony based
on theexperiences of Mine-Mill mem-
bers in key industrial aréis of the East.

On the basis of real life experiences,
they intended to tell the committee
that the “cost of living” index issued
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
the'U. S. Labor Department was far
from an accurate measure of the real

-- inflationary burden borne by workers

today.

Assisted by Victor Perla, ,,research
economist, Dowd and Lane ‘had pre-
pared facts and figures to demonstrate

‘ that the cost of food, both in Connecti-
' cut and New Jersey, had risen in some

cases more than twice as ,far ‘as

claimed by*the' BLS index. Their testi- -

mony was designed _to show also the‘

There were thousands—hundreds of
thousands——of urgent pleas delivered to
the White House.

‘ They came from high and low, from
tall shades of political conviction—in
telegrams, letters, post cards, petitions,
even telephone calls and picket lines.
They even came from overseas.
I As one voice, they cried out for Harry
Truman to use his special power as
.','President of the United States to save
the life of a poor Mississippi Negro,
scheduled to die on a framed-up rape
charge.
But the man in the White House
was deaf to all the. pleas and the
_ prayers. .
., Willie McGee was legally murdered
in Laurel, Miss.,iat 12:01 a.m. May 8.
“The brutal execution of Willie
* . McGee is a signal for all of us to step

I /up the fight against lynching,” Ray-
mjond Dennis, Mine—Mill board member i
for District 3 and chairman of the
International-Union’s civil rights com-
 2.-mittee, said last week. “It is also a
" signal to step up the fight for FEPC

clauses in every one of our contracts——

part and parcel of the same fight for
y _ civil rights.”

“Thousands of miners, millmen and
smelterinen took part in the long fight
for McGee's life, including our mem-
bers"in District 5 in the South,” said
Dennis. “They were left in a fighting
mood by the news that McGee had

y ‘;. ' been executed as part of the conspir-
'" acy to spread terror in the hea_rts of
Negroes in America.” A

‘?~ ‘Not one more McGee will die!-’..is
the firm resolution of our members
- and-"of‘all decent‘ Americans, none of
' whom will ever forget the failure of

Dear Rosalee :

They can’t do‘ this if you and

' A LARGE DELEGATION; of trade
union leaders travelled to Washington
in an attempt to pursuade President
Truman to act. They included leaders
of the United Public Workers, Ameri-
can Communications Association, and
rank-and-filers from Steel, Auto‘ and
other CIO unions. ’

Five hundred war veterans chained
themselves to the pillars at the Lincoln
Memorial in Washington, chanting

“Lincoln freed the slaves, Truman_ free.

leave.

Even’ CIO secretary-treasurer James

Carey and UAW president Walte’r“Reu- .

ther sent 11th-hour wires to Mississippi
governor Wright asking for clemency.
But it was noted that neither Carey nor
Reuther took part in the mass cam-

paign to free McGee, and that Reuther

had refused to permit McGee's wife,
Rosalee, to speak at the UAW conven-
tion last month. Top officials of the
American Federation of Labor said and
did nothing. "

Among the many appeals to President

Truman. was one signed by 91_nation- .

ally-famous.Americans in the fields of
art, science and literature, including

Donald Ogden Stewart, Dashiell Ham-A

mett, Josephine Baker, Olin Downes, E.

Another came from 90‘ noted Women

The day after the execution, -Mrs.

To’-the Ethtorz '
The‘ present ‘so-called controversy be-

' tween Emperor-General MacArthur and

Truman over what to_ do in Asia is de-
signed to befudd_1e the people into sup-

* porting the war program which Big

Business is dictating to our govern-
ment for them to carry out.
American Big Business think they
have a golden opportunity to take over
the crumbling empires of Britain,
France, Japan, etc., in a war against
the Soviet Union and her allies, there-
by achieving economic, political and
military domination of the world.
MacArthur and the Truman admin-
istration are in agreement with this

objective of Big Business. They differ '

only as to how, when and where to
launch the war against the Soviet Un-
ion and her allies. Powerful sections
of the Republican Party supported
MacArthur in the hope of winning con‘-

trol of the government to carry out

this horrible monstrosity against hu-
manity, claiming Truman is unable'to
Hp it. On the other.hand, Truman and
his cohorts fightffor adoption of his
war strategy as the bes way,—to hood-

wink the people into s pporting 'such

a war. .

Needless to say, zthis diabolical
scheme is doomed to failure, regardless
of -which group is given the assignment
to carry it out, but it will cause untold
death, destruction and suffering. As

witness—what is happening in Korea 

where hundreds of thousands have lost
their lives and the country destroyed,
while here in America, we workers are
not only called upon to fight and die in

such a war, but are saddled with the

heaviest taxes and highest cost of liv-

ing in the history of our country. All _

to pay for this so-called “Police Ac-
tion” in Korea. A

To the Editor: v

Last week the state of Mississippi
legally killed Willie McGee. For sev-
eral weeks prior to his execution, as
an officer of my shop and president in
the Amalgamated Local 735 here in
Cleveland, I had been circulating peti-
tions and sending telegrams to Presi-
dent Truman protesting .against this
action and demanding McGee's pardon.
-The refusal of President Truman to act
and the action of the state of Missisi-

sippi made me so mad that I decided to
do immediatelywhatl had been intend-
ing to do for a long time, sit down and
write you a letter on how I feel on a

_lot of things.

-I thought of writing a letter to the’

' Cleveland papers,‘ but past experience

Qf their anti-labor position, would make
it doubtful if I could ever get it print-
ed. At least I know in my own union
paper I'll be heard.

To some people the killing of the‘
Martinsville Seven and the recent kill-
ing oﬁ.)Willie McGee may 'be shocking
events.“ To’ me as a member’of the
Negro race they are continuing acts of
terror against my people for a purpose.
And while I fought for the Martins-
ville 7 and Willie McGee, I do not for-
get the hundreds of others who have
been lynched" in the South and the tens
of thousands of my fellow Negro Amer-
icans who are daily denied equal op-
portunity because of their race.

and I have had a long experience in
the labor movement. If I didn’t fight
together with many others, many years
ago, there would not have been a large
labor movement in the United States
today. So I am going to fight again.

I am going to fight against Jim Crow, ,

against high prices and I am going to
fight most of all for peace in the world.
Because I am convinced that only this
way can we have democracy at home.
I'know that millions of other trade
unionists in America and especially in
Steel and Auto feel the same way. I
am glad to belong to Miiie Mill and its
great tradition to give me an oppor-
tunity to express myself this way.

which ‘are being discussed wherever

read of polls being taken, here and

that if enough opinions can be added

the very life blood of our civilization,
we must conserve them, or die.
Knowing the effect of another World
War, and the unsolved problems so
glaringly clear at home, while we con-
tinue with everything as usual ip peace.
Would it not be of first importance to
go all the way to win the peace?
Then why not? We can if we go all
out and demend that our Governments
in the United States and Canada in-
stall the Total Conscription of Men,
Machines, Material and Money, with
Services From All and _Profits to None,
as laid down by Technocracy Inc: This
would eliminate profiteering thus re-
moving the motivating force towar”
war and making “peace” possible.
When we conscript our youth and
send them away,,,_ perhaps to die or be
maimed for life, we take all that they

have to give. Then why not do the

same for all who stay at home? Let
us all go on the same basis, whether
it be banke'r, businessman, politician,
labor leaders, workers .or others. Why
not, who has the right to ask for more?
Anyway, we would all be better off,
we would not.» have our present wor-
ries of insecurity, nor the fear for
our future of tomorrow. , ‘

Technobracy Inc. has a blueprinted
plan of Total Conscription designed to
cope with a major social emergency,
such as now. Total Conscription was
first presented to the people of North
America in June, 1940 in Canada, and
has beep backed by dozen_s of unions
and other organizations as well as
thousands of individual people both
in Canada and the United States.
Should we have adopted this designed
plan of. National operation any time
during World War II, we would now
be well on the way to winning the
peace. I '

Should we fail to adopt this pro-
gram of, Total Conscription, then we

SUDBURY, Ont.——Six fatal accidents

pin underground operations of “Interna-

tional Nickel Co. since the first of the
year‘ have coincided with a large-scale

,drive for expansion and increased pro-

duction at the sprawling nickel empire.

Of the six men killed, four met their,

deaths at the Creighton Mine, scene of

the company’s heaviest pressure for ex-'
pansion and production. The other two-

deaths occurred, at the Garson ;VIine and
the Frood Mine.

First victim of this year in the Inco
increased production
drive was 29-year-old D. Seguin, who
died underground at Creighton on Jan-
uary 8. A little more - than a week

‘later, on January 19, A. Baxter died

at the Garson Mine. .
ONE MONTH LATER, on February

22, M.lJalsic'h, 41-year-old Local 598.

executive board member, met instant
death in a shaft accident at Creighton.
Then after a lapse of a few weeks,
death struck twice in one day at this
same mine, when on ,May 8, two men,
C. Clifton, 33-year-old miner, and A.
Dwyer, 30-year-old Local 598 steward,
were killed in a Creighton Mine cave in.
The very next day, on May 9, D. Hamil-_

'ton, 48, and also a steward of Local

598, died when he was trapped in a fill
run. "

Local 598 officers have sharply raised
the question of frequent deaths with
the company, demanding that every
care bé taken to prevent further acci-
dents. Reports from miners indicate
heavy company pressure on the men
to increase production so that the com-
pany may cash in on current high
prices of nickel and copper and pre-
pare itself for expected price increases
for . these . metals.

. By Morry» Wright

I’VE had a rich experience in the past
week, reading speeches, editorials and
letters of Frederick Douglass. I wish
' there were recordings of his great pub-
lic addresses. It is very clear when
you"read his speeches that he was one
of the most eloquent men of his time,
or anytime. It is easy to believe re-
ports that he held audiences spellbound.

1 Itis only thanks to a series of lucky
accidents and a lot of courage on the
. part of D_ouglass that those speeches
ever were delivered and we have an

, opportunity to read them today. on
.A “Negro-breaker” by the name of

Covey almost killed those speeches with

A, 5. Beating that left 17-year-old Frederick.
" Douglass hanging‘ between life and

death for days. That was in 1834 in the
State of Maryland. Douglass was a
slave. Because he had a spirit that did
not crush easily, he was sent to a pro-

-1 fessional slave breaker. »

After six months of

back, and gave Covey such a fight’ that

’ the “breaker” was afraid of him and

did not keep him long.

Years later, ‘Dmfglass wrote:

_“1- was a changed being after that
fight. I was nothing before, I was a
man now . T . I had reached the
point at which I was not afraid to
die. This" spirit made me a freeman
in fact, though‘ I still remained a
slave in form.” ' ‘

A self-taught man.

Learning to read and write was pro-
hibited to s1aves—punishab1e by law
and by the slave-owner’s lash. But
Douglass, learned to readland write be-

~ fore heescaped the South, at the age

of 21. -
Though he had learned the skilled
tradeof caulking in a Baltimore ship-
yard during one period‘ of his slavery,
fDouglass was prevented by Jimcrow
from practicing this trade at his new
_home in Boston. Though forced to «work
long hours sawing wood, digging cellars
and loading _ships at a dollar a day, he

I I managed to continue his self-education.

At this time, Douglass started attend-

against slavery. He soon had a reputa-
tion as a speaker: and was hired as a
lecturer by the Massachusetts Anti-
Slavery Society. His reputation became

nation-wide and he was invited to go '

abroad to speak in England, Scotland
and Ireland. Friends there contributed
money to found a paper upon his return.

‘-This paper, The North Star, became a

Douglass became a leading strategist’
of the anti—s1avery movement. He op-
posed the “moral suasion” theory of
William Lloyd Garrison in favor of poli-
tical action, both to free the slaves and
to improve the condition of Negroes in
the North.

During the Civil War, Douglass de-
voted most of his energies, first to mo-
bilizing support for an “Emancipation
Proclamation; then to urging Negroes
to fight on the side of the Union Army.

After the war, Douglass fought for
continuation of the policies of Abraham
Lincoln, and against the forces of

NEW YORK —- Mine‘-Mill president

. John Clark, vice presidents Orville Lar-

son and Charles Wilson, secretary-treas-
urer Maurice Travis and all the M-M
executive board members were among
62 nationally-known labor leaders who

signedletters May 8 to each of the Big-

Four deputies to‘the foreign ministers’
meeting in Paris.

The letters called on the U. S., Bri_t-
ish, French and Scviet deputies to help
arrange a peaceful settlement of the
Korean war. They said continuance of
existing tensions “can result in a
devastating war which would bring
misery, death nnd starvation to mil-
lions of people of all nations.”

Recalling President Truman's state-
ment when he‘ ousted -General _Mac-
Arthur that the U. S. seeks to prevent
extension of the Korean conflict into
World War III, the unionists said:

“We support this objective, but we
urge that the only certain method of‘
preventing the extension of the Korean
conflict is to end it by peaceful ne-
gotiations. The foreign ministers are
now in a position to render a great
service "to . humanity by using their

terests, which led to championing oft} ,

many causes. He was one of the lead-

ing advocates of women’s right toil ; ._

alized. In 1848, he wrote in The North

W1'0te for ‘workers
Among countless eloquent passages.

from the speeches and writings of the. 
great Frederick Douglass, there .1 re ~‘

many of special interest to working
people today. From an editorial, “No:
Progress Without Struggle” were quoted-
the sentences appearing on a- mural at.
the Mine-Mill. convention of 1950. To-'
quote this passage further: _ ' _
“Let me give you a word of the;-.

history of the progress of human lib
erty shows that all concessions ‘yet
made to her august claims have been
born of earnest struggle . . . If there‘

Douglass’ reply to the epithet-“agita

“re "—was an impassioned stateme'n_
of his position. A A — _  U ‘ '
“You sneeringly call me an’, aboli
