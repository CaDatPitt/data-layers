THE MINE-MILL UNION

 
 

’ January. 196.46  

 

Clerical orr it
ABC Now Mine-Mill

BUFFALO, N.Y.-Workers at
the Buffalo Division of the Ana-
conda American Brass Company
are now 100 percent Mine-Mill
organized, following an election
early last month in which cleri-
cal workers at the plant, by a
20 to 1 count on a secret ballot,
disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO
federal local and applied for a
Mine- Mill charter.

All 30 workers in the unit have
signed up with Mine-Mill, and
will comprise the Buffalo Brass
Clerical Workers Union No. 941.

The production and mainten-

ance workers, Mine-Mill Local
593, and plant guards, Mine-
Mill Local 603, are also 100 per-
cent at the Buffalo Division.
’ Leading the drive to sign up
the clerical workers in Mine-
Mill were the local’s officers-
President Edward A. Brunette,
Vice-President Frank Pyzynaki,
Chief Steward James E. Rows,
and Roy Parkinson and Eugene
Rosinski, bargaining committee-
men. International Representa-
tive Joseph C. Scioli assisted.

Chicago Local Wins
6 and 7 Cent Hikes

CHICAGO, I1l.—A new three-
year contract was signed last
month by Chicago Amalgamated
Local No. 758 and the Central
Die Casting and Manufacturing
Co. It provides for general
hourly wage increases of six
cents each year for piece work-
ers and seven cents each year
for day workers.

The agreement improves the
hospitalization, sickness, and
accident insurance plan and pro-
vides another two cents per hour
in eliminating inequities be-
tween job classifications.

A number of improvements
were made in the contract deal-
with promotions, upgrading
within the rate range, shop
rules, eligibility for holiday pay,
and computing piece work earn-
ings.

Members of the local’s negoti-
ating committee were Verilee
Cain, shop chairman, Novetter
Files, Jurt Otte, Edward Mack-
ovitch, John Bandy, James

 

Pinta, business manager, and
Raymond Dennis, District 4 ex-
ecutive board member.

Morenci Local Cops
Softball Crown

CLIFTON, Ariz.—In a down-
to-the-wire race, the Morenci
Miners Union Local 616 softball
team won the Morenci-Clifton
league championship, shutting
out Coors 1 to 0 in the final
game. The union local later held
a banquet honoring the players
and their managers, Brothers
Ascencion (Pelon) Rios of‘ the
ore dressing division and Paul
Sierra of maintenance.

And Legion Citation

CLIFTON, Ariz. — Morenci
Miners Union Local 616 has re-
ceived a citation from the Amer-
ican Legion Boys’ State Depart-
ment of Arizona for “devotion to
the cause of Americanism, by
contributing to the education of
Arizona youth in the duties,
rights, and responsibilities of
American citizenship.” The un-
ion local had previously been
cited by American Legion Post
No. 21 here for meritorious ser-
vice and loyal cooperation in the
sponsorship of boys from the
Clifton and Morenci school sys-
tems to Boys’ State.

Negotiations Over

Anaconda Furnace

GREAT FALLS, Mont.—Local
No. 16 has moved to involve
the Federal Mediation and Con-
ciliation Service in a series of
negotiations now underway with
the Anaconda Company regard-
ing wages and conditions for the
men assigned to‘the new shaft
furnace in the Furnace Refin-
ery department.

To date, the union has been
able to increase the 19-man
crew proposed by the company
to a crew of 22 and up-grade
jobs affecting eight men by 51
cents per shift. Some company
concessions resulted f r o In a
three-hour spntaneous work
stoppage on ov. 26.

Negotiating for the union are

tered the hospital in Iuly and expects to get out in the spring or early summer. His tests.
are now negative, but the hospital keeps its patients for six months after they become
so. The lotions and toilet articles to the right of the radio were given to Terrill at a going- :
away dinner by members of the Miami (Ariz.) Miners Local Union No. 586, his home local._,«
The Kennedy memorial album on top of the radio is a gift from his wife Lenora. As inter-

Briefs _Requested

ln Arbitration Case

EL PASO, Texas-January
24 is the final date for submit-
ting briefs in an, arbitration
case here involving two Phelps
Dodge employees, Jesus Gomez
and Santiago Juarez, members
of El Paso Copper Refinery
Workers Local 501.

The two men had received
three-day disciplinary layoffs
for allegedly violating a com-
pany safety rule. Both testified
in oral arguments before Peter
Kelliher of Chicago that the

violations had not taken place,
and th at disciplinary action
was taken by W. M. Brooks,
the yard foreman, in retaliation
for a previous grievance they
filed against him.

Several other union members
told of Brooks’ inclination to
take revenge on workers who
disagree with him, pointing to
such actions as having a man
transferred to an early morning
shift, assigning disagreeable
work on. a steady basis, and
even having shade trees in the
yard cut down.

Tenn. Local Wins
Pay Hikes. Benefits

COLUMBIA, Tenn.—Across
the board wage increases of
five cents per hour went into
effect Dec. 1 for 51 workers at
the Armour Agriculture Chemi-
cal Co. The two-year contract
negotiated by Mine-Mill Local
546 calls for another five cents
per hour hike next year.

In addition, adjustments of
five cents per hour for mechan-

functioning of the union.

ics and of three cents per hour
for crane operators were made.
The contract calls for $13 per
week sick leave to be added to
the former $12 per week sick-
ness and accident benefits.‘
Pension schedules were set up
for all employees, figured by 5 »
multiplying $2.50 by number of -
years of service..There were -
other minor improvements.

for life insurance, a number of contract changes, and a few reclassifications.

The company wants another three-year contract, extending from December, 1963

to December, 1966. A contract
expired on Dec. 14, but was
extended on a day-to-day basis
while talks continued.
' Mine-Mill’s proposal calls for
W,-an expiration date of June 30,
- 1966, a date common with the
other‘ AS&R locals. In addition,
the union is asking for a reallo-
- cation of the wage increases,
j four weeks vacation for 20-year
men, elimination of the em-
ployee contribution toward the
health and welfare" costs, and
some additional reclassifications
and contract changes.
AS&R’s offer includes four
weeks of vacation time for 25-
year men. _
Pressing for union acceptance

_ of its proposal by Dec. 20, the
company made some noises

about contract termination after

that date. However, morale of
the workers is excellent and
they are reportedly determined
to achieve a good contract.

In October, Mine-Mill turned
back the Steelworkers attempt-
ed raid in the Coeur d’Alene
district, winning an NLRB elec-
tion by a whopping two to one
margin, despite the huge sums

spent by Steel for paid raiding

experts and full-page newspa-
. per advertisements.

At that time, AS&R Council

- Coordinator Irving Dichter said,

“The Page and Galena Victory
not only strengthens our union
in the Northwest, but ‘ also
strengthens the bargaining posi-
tion of all AS&R workers
throughout the country.”

’~ Dichter was again in Wallace
part of last month for the pres-
ent negotiations which are be-
‘ing handled by the Galena-Page
negotiating committee of Pat

‘ Williams, Luther Church, Quen-
tin Weichel, and Paul Church,
assisted by District 1 Board
Member Barney Rask and In-
ternational Representative J. L.
Cochran. '

An eight-page pamphlet on the mine safety survey
recently completed by the Department of the Interior
and the general need for federal mine safety legisla-
_tion will be soon made available to Mine-Mill member-
ship. I

The booklet, now in preparation at the interna-
tional headquarters, will be widely distributed—not
only to public officials throughout the country, but
also to labor unions and other organizations whose
pntembership can help push for the much-needed legis-

a ion.

The Metcalf-Montoya bill, now before the U. S.

Senate, is given particular attention in the pamphlet.

Unionists Run Well
In Sudbury Elections

SUDBURY, Ont.—Veteran labor figures in this area won strong
support in municipal elections here last month. Mike Solski, long
term president of Local 598 and now a national vice-president of
Mine-Mill, was returned to the office of Mayor of the town of
Coniston, defeating his nearest opponent by a three to one margin
in a heavy voter turnout.

Nels Thibault, whose campaign
called for taxation relief and ef-
forts to bring secondary indus-
try into the area, just missed
being. elected to the four man
Board of Control in his first bid
for municipal office in Sudbury.
Also a former president of Local
598 and a former national presi-
dent of Mine-Mill, now serving
on the union’s District 2 staff,
Thibault rolled up 6,066 votes,
just a few hundred short of the
fourth spot in that contest.

Other Mine-Mill men contest-
ing for office did well. Norman
Young, a member of the Local
598 executive board, was named
to the School Board in Sudbury.
Chester Patterson, running for
the council seat in Ward 5,
rolled up an impressive count.

Solski will be serving his
third term as Coniston’s mayor.

to fcondition” Congress, the people, and even school children
against the American trade unions.

This broad propaganda attack by the NAM against all unions
is the next logical step in its long campaign to weaken, divide, and
ultimately destroy the trade union movement.

It began 16 years ago with the Taft-Hartley law (the first step),
and has produced the McCarran Act of 1954
and the Landrum-Griffin law of 1959. Today
a host of anti-labor legislation reposes in
Congressional committee in both the Senate
and the House. Very little noise is being
made about these proposed bills now, and
to what extent they will be pushed in 1964,
an election year, remains to be seen.»

But they are there in committee and
when the time seems ripe to jam one or
more of them through, you can bet the
power and inﬂuence of the NAM will be
put into high gear behind them. In addition
to its Washington operation, the NAM uses
its influence and lobbyists in virtually every .
one of the 50 state legislatures, supporting Swen" .
state “right-to-work” laws and other forms of anti-union and anti-
social legislation.

The Next Step—-Destroy Collective Bargaining

The Taft-Hartley law covers many phases of union operation.
They told us-in 1947 when it was passed that it was intended to
“curb the abuses and special privileges "to unions” under the
Wagner Act. ’ ’

They told us in'1954 that the McCarran Act was aimed at
“chasing the Reds out of unions.”

They told us in 1959 that the Landrum-Griffin law was needed
to “catch the crooks” in the unions. 4 ‘

Now, under the provisions of several of these new bills in
Congress, the‘NAM is going to “save the public” from the “abuse
of _union bargaining power” by applying anti-trust laws to labor
unions. «

Most of us saw the screaming headlines in the press recently
when James Hoffa announced that the Teamsters Union would
seek nationwide agreements in 1964. You’d think that the Teamsters
had committed an act of treason. All sorts of anti-Hoffa editorials
appeared, together with alarming warnings as to the dangers
of such bargaining power.

This is just a sample of the NAM campaign to undermine col-
lective bargaining and ultimately destroy the trade union move-
ment in America. Should they succeed in their aims, Mine-Mill
would have to disband its bargaining councils—and our national
bargaining program. A National Wage Policy Conference, such as
the one scheduled this month in Tucson, Arizona, would be a giant
“conspiracy” against the federal law. .

All local unions would have to bargain separately. If you went
on strike, you’d do it alone. Accepting assistance from any other
local or honoring another local’s picket line would be a “con-
spiracy” to violate the law.

 

These are just a few examples of the scores of provisions to -

impede and prevent collective bargaining contained in bills already
introduced by Sﬁiators McClellan of Arkansas, Thurmond of South
Carolina, and Tower of Texas, and by Congressman Dave Martin
of Nebraska and Bruce Alger of Texas.

How to “Sel " the NAM Program

The following suggestions to manufacturers and businessmen,
prepared and distributed by the Industrial Relations Division of
the NAM, explains one phase of how to sell the program in your
community. Reading them should expel any doubts about the
nature of the NAM program.

“1. Work toward getting a hearing for a bill of our own design
before the next session of Congress. .

“2. Sponsor a high school essay contest on ‘What Union
Monopoly Means to America.’

“3. Prepare a kit similar to the one used by the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce in its successful campaign against secondary boy-
cotts, dealing with union power.

A“4. Recruit key ‘idea’ and influential men and women in
geographical areas and other organizations to ‘educate’ and rally
support for the contemplated legislative action.

“5. Get together a sponsored TV special on the dangers from
unions.

“6. Prepare special material for Women’s _Club Programs.

“7. Prepare and distribute a Speakers Kit for businessmen and
‘opinion molders’ to be used wherever a platform is available.

“8. Recruit a group of ‘sympathetic journalists’ to work with
the NAM (as though they don’t already have such a group) and
then call in the Madison Avenue public relations experts to put
the story across.”

What Can the Unions Do?
We can start working together on the political front at least.
We can stop cut-throat raiding, name calling, and Red-baiting,
and all the other games that divide and split labor. We can
establish active statewide and nationwide Political Action Commit-
tees that will include all unions and that will develop a vigorous
and realistic political action program in every state and throughout

the nation in 1964. These few things would be a start in the right
direction.

Fortunately, more and more trade unions and honest union
leaders are becoming concerned about this relentless drive against
all organized labor. It’s no longer only the Longshoremen, or the
Teamsters, or Mine-Mill who are under the gun. It’s the whole
trade union movement.

Every union and every union leader should re-examine the
old but proven slogan, “An injury to one is an injury to all"—and
start practicing this simple policy once more.

V I   Union Confracf

For-_SmH'h-Kelly Co.

SAVANNAH; ‘Ga.—After five
and a, half months of negotia-
tions,"Lo'cal 870 has reached a
settlement with the Smith &
Kelly Co. here, which calls for
hourly wage increases in the
top classifications of from 10 to
15 cents, with another four
cents hike due to start on Dec.
1, 1964.

This is the first agreement at
this fertilizer plant, which was
finally organized by Mine-Mill

last spring, with 82 workers

voting in the NLRB election.
The company had resisted,
over the past 15 years, several
attempts made by other unions
to organize the plant.

The union rejected a company offer of 10.4 cents an hour._tl_iis*_j5;_
year (9.5. cents‘ an hour wage increase and an additional 0.9<cent' 

in upgrading of stope miners),
with an automatic wage hike of
five cents per hour starting Nov.
1, 1964.

This offer was contingent upon

elimination of the free bus ser- .

vice provided workers since 1937
and which the company main-
tains is worth 41/.3 cents of the
package offered. In other words,

the increase offered for this

year ‘would amount to only 5.9
cents an hour, . . _
According to newspaper ac-
counts, the union has revised its
proposal to a, 91/2 cents an hour
package, comprised ofa seven

cents» an hour wage increase, -11/2 .

cents for improved vacation
benefits, and one cent for a
$2500 insurance program for re-

which demands continuation of

Steel is currently trying to
cast blame for the inferior con-
tract pattern in the district on
the" Northwest Metal Wo_rkers,
an independent union at Bunker
Hill’, ‘which three -years ago
broke the Mine-Mill ‘strike and
gained bargaining rights there.
Steel had been the only union in

’ the country to support the North-

west Metal Workers at , that
time.

In countering Steel’s charges,
Northwest has pointed out that
the Steelworkers have had bar-
gaining rights at Sunshine since
1955 and have been unable either
to establish its own pattern or
to maintain the district pattern

.set by Mine-Mill. ’

Meanwhile, Mine-Mill Local
No. 18, which has bargaining
rights at several properties in
the Coeur d’Alenes, has adopted
unanimously a resolution sup-

. American Cancer s Report on Smokmg
 A massive study of 422,094 men by the American Cancer Society demonstrates a striking correlation between
" cigarette smoking and death rates; not only deaths caused by lung cancer, but those due to coronary, heart disease

. . Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond, chief statistician of the ACS, presented the findings of the 34-month study early last
' i month at the 17th annual clinical meeting of the American Medical Association in Portland, Ore.—after which the
' AMA immediately earmarked $500,000 for long-range research into the relationship of smoking to health.
1; ; 9 The AMA’s action, and previous inaction, was ripped by Sen. Maurine B. Neuberger (D., Ore.), who accused
1 the AMA of playing into the hands of the American tobacco industry. - - -

 

is unequivocal warning to every American that smoking,.by what-
'ever the‘ mechanism, is a serious threat to health.” She said that
.~ the industry would use the AMA’s stand to imply that theresults
‘ _ are notiyet clearcut, that further research must first be done.

,' _ . In England, following a British Royal College of Physicians
. report in 1962 that heavy smoking cuts life expectancy, the govern-
~ meat immediately began a campaign to alert the public of the
dangers. ‘

 

A»  -theages of 40 and 89,. Not only did the report affirm earlier studies

  vsmokingwith premature death, but it also gave indications    4
' J

_‘ '_that;-.the more deeply youginhale, the "greater your risk of death;

-, the younger you were when you began smoking, the greaterﬂyour

‘THE MINE-MILL ‘UNION

January. 1964- 6‘

Rank and Fife,-5 Tell of Rail Unions Challenge Ruling

condifions unde, gee] Of Federal Arbitration Board

GREAT FALLS, Mont.—Four rank and file members of the Mill and Smelter-
men’s Union Local No. 16 here, who visited the smelter and foundry at Anaconda last
month, reported back to the membership that conditions at the plant were deteriorat-
ing under contract with the United Steelworkers of America.

A short time ago some members of Local 117 in Anaconda had attended a Local
16 meeting, describing the situation at Anaconda and urging the Great Falls local to
send some members over so that they could see for themselves what was going on

l there. —

Steel took over bargaining rights at Anaconda from Mine-Mill in May, 1962, win-
ning an NLRB election after a campaign in which Steel greatly exaggerated its bar-
gaining power—as proved by subsequent events.

Thomas VanGorder, Glen Sanders, Richard Moltzan, and Kenneth Linn comprised
the delegation chosen by Local 16 to go to Anaconda. They attended a meeting of
Mine-Mill Local 117, visited the smelter and foundry to talk with the workers, and

stopped to see the local griev-
ance committee at the Steel
Union office there. In his re-
port to the Local 16 member-
ship, Moltzan pointed out that
their tour of the plant had not
been prearranged, but that “we
just went and visited with
whomever we wanted to.”

All four members of the

delegation confirmed to the L0-
cal 16 membership, who them-
selves had narrowly beat back
an attempted raid by Steel in
April, 1962, that the Anaconda
workers are now disgruntled
about their contract and the
worsening conditions at the
plant. .
V VanGorder, who’ had sup-
ported steel in 1962, said he
was “appalled at what I saw.”
“The
conda,” who had visited Local
16, he said, “did not lie; they
minimized the conditions at
Anaconda.”

Following are excerpts from
VanGorder’s report at the Dec.
4 meeting of Local 16:

“We contacted the Steel Un-
ion officials but could not get

‘ any straight answers from them.

It seems that Steel made the
men a lot of promises the first
two months and then forgot all
about them. Some of the jobs
formerly had a quota of work,
but now when the men get
through with their quotas, the
boss finds them other jobs to
do and nothing is said about it.
New employees have to wait a
hell of a long time to qualify for
vacations. The switching crew
that used to have 25'or 30 men
now has to get along with five
men.”

l “I tried to contact some of
the shop stewards, but could
not find any. If a man has a
grievance, he must go down-
town to file it at the Steel of-
fice. One of the biggest beefs at
Anaconda is working conditions,
and there is no sign of their
getting any better. After my
visit, I'm convinced that Steel
is not for me . . . I still prefer
Mine-Mill, and wish that more
rank and file members could go
over there and find out the truth
for themselves.”

Said Sanders about the trip:

“Of course I have always
been a strong Mine-Mill sup-
porter, but I was proud to have
an opportunity to make the trip
to Anaconda. I wanted to see
what the workers there had to
say about Steel, and, I tell you,
we could not find one worker
that wouldadefend the Steel Un-
ion. Instead, some of them
wanted to punch you in the
nose when you mentioned the
name. Many workers stated
that the Steel Union had done
absolutely nothing for them.
except that they had allowed
the company to destroy their
working conditions.”

“I can tell you that the men
are really unhappy with the
Steel Union at Anaconda. Had
we had Mine-Mill cards, we
could have signed up . . . I
don't know how many men.
Some of them asked if we ‘had
any Mine-Mill cards. Up untll
now I haven’t taken too much
interest in our umon or the
serious problems it faces, but
now I am ready to fight In
every way that I know how in

Herbert Lehman, Friend

0i Labor, Dead at 85

NEW YORK——Herbert H. Lehman, 85, long a friend
of and fighter for labor and liberalism, died here Dec. 4,

the victim of a heart attack.

Four times governor of New York and a former U.S.

. Senator, Lehman did not enter politics actively until he

was 50. A partner in Lehman Brothers, a banking firm,
he had a successful career in the financial world, but
resigned in 1928 to run for and Win the lieutenant

governor's seat. When New York
Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt
moved on to the presidency in
1932, Lehman won the gover-
nor’s chair and held it for 10
years.

In 1949, in a special election
to fill a U. S. Senate seat, Leh-
man defeated J ohn Foster
Dulles, and served for eight
years. ’ ,

One of the first to criticize
the investigating tactics of the
late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy
(R., Wis.), Lehman continued to
be active in politics until
his death. A Democrat, he and
the late Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
led the r e f o r m movement
against the Democratic organ-
ization in New York—a drive
which ousted Carmine G. de
Sapio as leader of Tammany
H al 1, Manhattan’s powerful
Democratic organization,
in 1961.

Lehman was the first recipi-
ent of the AFL-CIO Murray-
Green Award for outstanding
service to labor. He and Mrs.
Roosevelt were co-chairmen of
the National Council for indus-
trial Peace, a committee which
has fought constantly “right-to-
wor ” laws.

In 1946 he was nominated for,
but did not win, the
Peace Prize for his ‘work as
director general of the United
Nations Relief and Rehabilita-
tion Administration.

At the time of his death, Leh-
man was preparing for a trip
to Washington where he was to
have been awarded, along with
30 other Americans, the Free-
dom Metal. Awarded posthum-
ously, the citation reads “Citi-
zen and Statesman, he has used
wisdom and compassion as the

Nobel ’

in CI Race for the Senate

tools of government and has
made politics the highest form
of public service.”

Ariz. Local Wins

Arbitration Award

MIAMI, Ariz. -— Arbitrator
Bert L. Luskin awarded a de-
cision to Miami Miners Union
Local 586 last month after a
grievance had been submitted
to arbitration by the union and
the Inspiration Consolidated

Copper Company. The local con- ,

tended that its jurisdiction had
been invaded when leadburners,
members of the Plumbers and
Pipefitters Union, were assigned
work previously done by lead-
burner helpers and handymen
who are members of Mine-Mill.
The decision held that the com-
pany had acted improperly in
assigning leadburners to this
work, and awarded pay at over-
time rates to the helpers and
handymen who should have re-
ceived the job assignments.

 

WASHINGTON—Three rail unions have asked the
Federal District Court here to strike down a railroad ar-

bitration board ruling which authorizes the nation’s rail-

roads to eliminate gradually most of the jobs of firemen

on freight and yard diesels.

The Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, Train-

men’s, and Switchmen’s unions also authorized their at-
torneys to file another suit attacking theiconstitutionality

of the emergency law passed last August by Congress ~

which set up the seven-man ar-
bitration board—the first ever
established b y Congress in
peacetime.

The ruling of the arbitration
board, set up to write a com-
pulsory solution to the issues of
firemen’s jobs and sizes of train
crews in the four-years-old work
rules dispute, becomes effective
Jan. 25, but only for two years
according to the law passed by
Congress. A ’

Although the board’s award
establishes a job-cutting pro-
cedure that could eventually
mean eliminating 90 percent -
or about 30,000—of the firemen’s
jobs, it surrounded this pro-
cedure with elaborate job and
income protections for the af-
fected employees so that actual
job reductions will probably be
small.

Although the unions are chal-
lenging the ruling, the board’s
decision certainly was not a

clear-cut victory for the carriers,‘

for the board obviously recog-
nized the key labor need of job
security.

The award provides that fire-
men with two to 10 years of ser-
vicexmust be kept on the job
until the company offers them

comparable jobs elsewhere, pro-

viding expenses if -needed, and —
also guaranteeing‘ maintenance-7

of-earnings for five years. 'Fire- . C, , .

men with 10 or more yearsof ’"°‘ ‘.

service are given lifetime job
protection, as firemen, until they
retire, are discharged for cause,
or otherwise removed my ina-
tural attrition. It is estimated
that over 90 percent of the’fire-
men fall into one of these“tW
categories. ”
The question of crew makeup,
other than for engines, was re-

turned by the _ board to the

 

parties for negotiation on a ‘lo-_ 

cal basis. However, the National

Mediation Board was given ’
power to impose binding de-
cisions on the size of crews 

local negotiations fail.
Meanwhile, the parties are
holding talks on “secondary” is-

sues -— management‘ demands
. dealing with length of crew _run-sq;
and combinations of yard -and

road work, and union proposals

for a new pay structure, fringe _ - ii. A
benefits, and training programs. A

b The ban voted by Congress on
strikes over these “secondary”
issues expires on Feb. 24, which

could set the stage for another T

rail crisis at that time.

U. S. TARIFF COMMISSION was rapped in a resolution adopt-
ed at the AFL-CIO convention late in November. The Tariff Com-
mission early in 1963 turned down a Mine-Mill petition for federal
unemployment compensation and other benefits for 126 workers
laid off with the closing of the New Jersey Zinc Company’s mine at
Hanover, New Mexico. This was the first such petition filed by
any U. S. trade union, and the commission’s action was vigorously
protested by then President John Clark. Later the commission
turned down three similar petitions filed by AFL-CIO unions on
behalf of unemployed workers.

The convention resolution recalled labor’s support of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962 on condition that the law provide benefits
for workers hurt by lowered tariffs ‘and increased imports. It said

if that ‘the Tariff Commission had made this feature of the law
“meaningless” and that the rejection of the petitions had been
based on “narrow interpretations” of the‘ law. The resolution fa-
vored either action by the administration or amendment of the
law to make the benefits available to laid-off workers.

A few days later, the Tariff Commission turned down a fifth

 petition—tliis time on behalf of laid-off ceramic mosaic tile work-
ers who claimed injury from increasing imports caused by past
tariff cuts. The commission disagreed, claiming the layoffs were
due to “industrial innovation.” No other petitions on behalf of laid-
off workers are before the Tariff Commission. Labor unions now
figure there is no use filing petitions with the commission, stacked
as itlis at present.

- LAST MONTH IT WAS ZINC’S TURN. Early in December
major producers raised zinc’s price to 13 cents per pound. Zinc
was last at 13 cents just three years ago, and had fallen to a low
of 111/2 cents over most of 1962. The price hike reﬂected continued
strong demand for zinc from die casters and galvanizers and
. steadily tightening supplies of zinc in hands of producers, despite
i reopening of many U. S. zinc mines since mid-year.

_ and operated until 1957 when zinc fell to 10 cents per pound. AS&R

MINING OF OIL SHALE deposits in Colorado, Utah, and
Wyoming within the next three years was predicted by John W.
Smith, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Laramie, Wyoming, at a meeting of
petroleum geologists last month. Smith cited estimates ranging
from 11/2 to 4 trillion barrels of oil locked in shale in the three
states. He said ground conditions were adapted to room and pillar
mining, with little need for roof support. Mining, he said, would
be with machines already adapted to coal and potash mining, with
little need for use of explosives. Ores would be continuously re-
torted to extract oil. * ‘ ‘F

BRITISH COLUMBIA has experienced in 1963 the most inten-

sive exploration for minerals in the 100 years plus history of the

province. More than 500 geologists, prospectors, and engineers
have spent more than $10 million hunting for mineral deposits. At
least 62 big mining companies have had exploration parties in the
field, looking mainly for copper, iron, and molybdenum. Among
companies looking for molybdenum deposits are American Metal
Climax, Consolidated Mining and Smelting, Noranda Mines, Ken-
necott, and Phelps Dodge. Production of minerals in British Colum-
bia in 1962 totaled $229 million, an all time high.

COST OF LIVING IN CHILE rose 40 percent in the first eleven
months of 1963, according to a recent special dispatch to American
Metal Market, daily metal trade paper. Workers at Anacondas
El Salvador mine in Chile_ are demanding a 100 percent increase
in wages plus other benefits when their present contract runs out
on Feb 1. The dispatch says, “With the way Chilean inflation is
going, many do not regard the demands as much out of the way
as they did five or six weeks ago.” *

LEADPRICE, now 121/2 cents a pound, is headed for another
jump to 13 cents soon, says a writer in the current Bulletin of the
National Association of Purchasing Agents. _What could_ trigger the
rise, he says, would be cold weather this winter, creating demand
for storage batteries, and with it, higher requirements for lead.

Metcalf Lauds Udall
Mine Safety Report

Senator Lee Metcalf (D., Mon-t.), cosponsor of the Metcalf-
Montoya mine safety bill introduced’ at the request_ of Mine-Mill
last July, hailed in a recent Senate speech Interior Secretary
Udall’s long-awaited report on mine ‘safety, saying that this
excellent report and its recommendations aim at the heart of
the problem areas of safety and health.” _

The hard-hitting report, completed in November after two
years of studies, raps ineffective state mine safety laws, codes,
and mine safety enforcement, and recommends a federal program
of safety inspection and enforcement for metal and non-metal
mines. r ‘ _

' “Neither regulations nor legislation will eliminate mine acci-
dents,” Metcalf told the Senate,
but said that “If carried out, the
recommendations (of the Udall
report) will go a long way
toward reducing deaths and se-
rious injuries in the industry.”

Metcalf, when a Congressman
in 1956, was chairman of a spe-

cial House Subcommittee on

(D., Mont.), Edward Roybal
(D., Calif.), George Senner (D.,
Ariz.), and Morris Udall (D.,
Ariz.)

told reporters, “The study has
shown us what the major causes
of injuries and fatalities are,
and it has indicated a need for
positive action. The Secretary’s
recommendations propose pro-
grams under which manage-
ment, labor, and state and fed-
eral agencies can cooperate to
help make the nation’s metal
and nonmetal mines safer places
in which to work.” 3

Jobless Claims
Slill Unsellled ,

ln Banner Strike

TUCSON, Ariz. -— Continued
picketing and no negotiations is
still the story of Local 929’s
strike against the Banner Min-
ing Company here, now in its
eighth month.

At the same time, strikers
continue to be maintained by
donations from other southwest
locals, Local 392 at Magna, Utah,
and a Weekly check from the
International Union Strike Fund.
The local’s claim that the strik-
ers should be entitled to unem-
ployment compensation is
tangled in a legal snarl, with
no new developments expected
until late this month or early
February.

The lack of serious negotia-
tions and the union’s claim that
the workers should be getting
unemployment insurance pay-
ments both stem from the local’s
allegation that Banner is not
operating for reasons connected
with a lease option to the Ana-
conda Copper Co., and not be-
cause of the strike.

Early in December, Judge Lee
Garrett of the Pima County
Superior Court ordered the case
involving the unemployment
claims remanded to the Arizona
Employment Security Commis-
sion fora new hearing which
would take into account evi-
dence secured at a special hear-
ing on Nov. 19. The commission

previously had issued a ruling

denying unemployment beneﬁts
to the strikers.
The Pima County court, in re-

V manding the matter to the com-

mission, retained jurisdiction
and will rule on the validity of
the new decision of the com-
mission if it is contested by the
union. .

Acting for the union in the
court hearing were Local 929
President Nicolas V. Morelos,
Financial Secretary Ted Mar-
tinez, Strike Committeeman
Tony de la Ossa, and Interna-
tional Representative Sylvain
Schnaittacher.

Silicosis Study to Be Release Soon

The U. S. Public Health Service-Bureau of Mines Environmental Health Study on
silicosis and dust problems in underground metal mines has been completed. Engi-
neering studies were conducted in 68 mines and medical studies were conducted at 50
of the same mines. The project Was financed by an appropriation which Mine-Mill lob-
bied for- successfully in 1957 and 1958. Originally it had been planned to release the
silicocis report simultaneously with the release of Interior Secretary Udall’s Health

and Safety Study of Metal and
Nonmetal mines, which was sub-
mitted to Congress in Novem-
ber. The Udall report indicates
that the silicosis report will be
released soon.

on Dec. 30, 1897, is one of the oldest continuously affiliated ‘loo’
of Mine-Mill. It was in 1916 that the Western Federation of Min
changed its name to the International Union of Mine, <Mill,ran

Smelter Workers.

Recognizing‘ the wisdom and courage needed to maintainjtli‘

union during the hectic years of
the Palmer raids following
World War I, the officers and
members of this local take pride

L in the contribution it has made

to the labor movement in Great
Falls, in Montana, and within
Mine-Mill. In its 66-year history,
not once has the local been
delinquent in paying its per
capita tax ormeeting its other
union obligationsﬁ

however, officers and stewards
