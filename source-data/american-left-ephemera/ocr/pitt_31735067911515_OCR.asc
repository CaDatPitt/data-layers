’ "WASHINGTON, D. C.—<Mine-
Mill is stepping up its Campaigfl‘
A to educate Congress and the Ad-
ministration on the critical plight
of jobless lead and zinc miners.

A Int’l Vice President Orville Lar-
son and Washington Representa-
tive .Herman Clott presented as
a typical case the plight of 752

_; hardrock miners fromtlie Silver
. City area of New Mexico. Fifteen
per cent *of these workers have
been out of work so long they
have "used up -all their unemploy-
ment compensation payments.
, The remaining 473- face a similar

‘ - lot before June is _over. _
To show how the mine shut-
down is hurting the entire com-
munity, Clott revealed that for
every 100 miners idle, 20' persons
» engaged in service» or tradelose

' their jobs. .

 Clott said this “pool” of jobless
 workers is typical in some ways
 of those that still exist in many
parts of the country. The miners’

s p_r_oblem is complicated, he added,
by the fact that the big U. S.
-mining corporations are_dumping
lead’ and zinc from their foreign
mines on the American market
-and forcing small domestic mines
owned by other companies to shut

» down. .
Meanwhile, executive board
member C. D. Smot'hermon and
‘ Local 890 president‘ Juan Chacon
,. made up a two-man delegation to
_ Allﬁiquerque and Santa Fe to
f press, for jobs for the unemployed

 { . Silver City area min_ers. -
 They talked with the "assistants
‘T of ‘ both Senator Anderson and
a Senator Chavez, as well as leaders
_'{,3-.3 of the Democrat__ic and .Rep'ublican
:':»(-sgiarties in Albuquerque and Santa

 

A e." At the office of the state
.'’.-highway commissioner, -they
._ urged quick action on_a program
 of roads in Grantcounty. And‘
,_ they spoke to officals of the state

  

' ; Finally, they called at the office
{of Governor Mechem, to make
 sure the governor himself is

aware of the critical situation in

Our convention program “A World at Peace” pointed out

industry, might result from the kind of expanded foreign trade

about half of the world’s production of metals, it is now’ being

if GREAT FALLS and surrounding communities in Montana were
 hit/‘this’ past week by a devastating flood. l\-'Iany_meI-nbers of this
" union and their families suffered terrible consequences, some los-
if ing their homes and belongings. Damage throughout the state, in a
 conservative -estimate, was over_ three million dollars. Some 14 coun-
ties were declared a national emergency disaster area. A
- ‘ How much longer are the people of this country
going to place their destinies in the hands of lawmak-
ers who subject themselves-to the lobbyists of the
power companies and special interests? ~ I
For years, along with progressive Senators, Con-
gressmen and other groups this Union has advocated
the passage of bills in Congress which would place in
the hands of the people the power to control our val-
uable resources*and to eliminate these disastrous
yearly floods—just aswas done in the Tennessee Valley project.

- THE MILLIONS of dollars of damage done in the past decade
would ha_ve already paid a great part ‘of the construction of dams to
controlthe flood waters. Income from power and other benefits would
in all probability have carried the rest of the costs. ‘

j But those who are subjugated by the special monopoly interests

  

 and losses they suffer. I

1

The present Republican controlled congress is even going further
with this go-to-hell program—the tidelands oil steal, their bolder at-
tempts in Rep. D’Ewart’s bill to take away control of the forest reserve
grazing -rights and hand it over to the large cattle and sheep concerns;
.. their handing to private power companies of the people’s dam sites,

_ - D, " TODAY, because‘of these special,interests and the favors they
,  gain from their backers in Congress, the workers in our industry
not only suffer under this type of loss, but their whole economic fu-
ture" is threatened by the dumping of cheap-mined foreign metals,
"controlled and exploited by the metal companies. I

5 Todaywe see thousands of "our miners. and smeltermen on the
_ unemployment lines. The latest shutdown is in Leadville, Colorado——
 «the Resurrection mine, and AS&R_smelter—-—adding more hundreds of
I _.men to the jobless parade.

0 cause in spite of tariffs, stockpiling, or other methods, they can still

 : tage of 'the workers in the industry and the smaller companies.
L We fight for more liberal unemployment compensation, for better
social security. They fight-against them. Their plan, with the aid’ of
their diabolical anti—labor Taft-Hartley and other laws, is to crowd the
rustling lines, speed upon the job-and break labor unions.

on ALL THIS MEANS we must keep up a, "continuous barrage to
our Senators and Congressmen, urging them to fight for progressive
legislation on these matters and to oppose those measures which take
away our resources". ‘ " .

Flood wrecks   homes of  
fifty  Mine-Mill families

GREAT_FALLS, Mont.——More than
50 families of Mine-Mill members
were hard hit last week when the ram-
paging Sun River smashed a 300 foot
hole in the dike and flooded the west-
ern end of Great Falls and the nearby
village of Belt.

Within hours after officers of Great’

Falls Sineltermen’s Union, Local 16,
had called the Denver office to report
the disaster, Int’l president John Clark
had opened a campaign for relief to the
flood victims.

Members of the-*.local’were heartened‘
by the news that a sizeable cash dona-

tion was on the way from the Interna- ‘

tional Union. At the same time, Presi-
dent Clark, who was an officer of Local
16 for many years, sent an appeal for
funds to all locals. '

“This particular local has been the
backbone of this International through-
out its charter years in the 1890's,”

Clark wrote, “never failing from that_

time in its per capita or its obligations

to the parent body, and has. always.

been ready in its share of aid to the
struggles of labor and its fight for the
welfare of all members.

“This flood has placed a hardship
on this membership and their families
which I think calls for unstinted aid
from its sister locals and their member-
ship in helping to alleviate this (lis-
tress. I am sure you will answer that
call,” his appeal said. -

, AT LEAST 500 Great Falls residents

were forced to evacuate from.,a 30- ,

block area, as ‘the water covered the
ground floor windows of many houses,
and in some cases even submerged
rooftops and chimneys. Another 1,500

had fled their homes when wo1'd of the V

bursting dike was-spread.
The 100-mile Sim river empties‘ into

the Missouri, river at Great Falls, and ,
heavy rains for several days had swol-‘

 feet of water was flowing through.

  
 
   
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
  
  
   
   
   

len the stream to flood stage. Governor
Hugo Aronson proclaimed a state of
emergency in 13 counties.

Worst hit was the town of Belt,
where many members of Local 16 live.
The town of 700 was without drinking
water for several days and up to 30

V -some parts of it. The homes of several’
Mine-Mill families were a total loss,
while others were badly damaged.

I Tb the Editor:

.. \ I
I wish to express the support of
many men from our local for the con-

‘Jtract demand advanced by the Inter-

  

—.  ° -tional disease ‘fund.

While we are in agreement with the

, .recent_ article appearing in THE
A ‘AU-NION explaining silicosis and dust
 ».hazards in the industry that .produce
.this disease, we‘ feel that there are
other occupational diseases that are
common in this industry and, equally,

Nearly all non-ferrous metal ores
contain arsenic. At the Tacoma Smelter
.‘large quantities are taken from the
.~::fl.ues, refined and sold for various in-
‘ “ dustrial uses. Around the arsenic re-
“fining plant is the most hazardous
place in the smelter, -although men

posed to sufficient quantities of arsenic
toproduee cancer.

Accordingato Dr. Huepner (Occupa-
tional Tumo,_rs__ and Allied Diseases),
half a milligram of arsenic taken into
the body daily over a period of several

‘ years is sufficient to cause the disease.

Although states (New York, New

--Although this disease probably isn't
 as widespread as itwas some years
.,"-iago, before the local union forced the
"'-companyto provide exhaust systems,

 
 

  

'  (‘laundered daily), there are still many

_of the disease and many others who
have died because of failure of one of
*'.,the vital organs, without the cause_for
failure of these organs being deter-
pl mined. 1

"-“arsenicism is a disease which is often
not recognized but is diagnosed as some
-_other disease. (Hopkins and Van "Stud-

 f Local physicians are certainly influ-
enced by the pressure a‘ big corporation

  

' -_u.si_1‘ally take/the path of least resistance
apd diagnose the disease as something
so. I feel that an accurate accounting
lould show this disease which is occu-

Two years ago, our local set up a
committee to study the occupational
disease problems of -men working at
the American Smelting and Refining
Company’s big smelter here. Although
we did not have the. funds to conduct
the kind of survey that we feel is now
required, we ‘found silicosis to be a
relatively minor problem compared to
some of the‘ following chemical toxi-
\cant _reactions.

  ARSENICAL CANCER  ~

Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois,
Wisconsin) which allow compensable
claims for arsenical cancer as an occu-
pational disease recognize it only in
the form of skin cancer, we found that
deaths from lung cancer were nearly a
hundred times higher for men wo_rking
in the smelter for the- previous year
than for the general population.

Many men in the'p‘lant' also have
diedwith cancer of the throat, intes-
tines, stomach and liver. Skin‘ cancers
are so frequent and widespread it was
impossible for us to determine the
incidence and make comparisons with
general population figures. 

CHRONIC ARSENICAL POISONING‘ ~

rhosis of the _liver, but since no medical
records were available to us in making
the study, we could not record the in-
cidence’ of this disease here.

There are many other toxic chemicals
in thevdust and gasses around the smel-

.ters which the big corporations make

no effort to control that are responsible
for sicknesses/and death in indetermin-
ate numbers.

Blood diseases such as Erythro-
cytosés, which is produced following
reduced oxygen tension, exposure to
hydrogreni sulphide, hydrogen cyanide
or contact with arsenic, lead and anti-
mony are very common. Toxic chemi-'
cals other than arsenic such as nickel
carbonyl (also refined from copper
ores) can be responsible for the devel-

-opment of cancer,’ too. ‘

\. I— feel that a complete study and re-

 

port of the occupational hazards in the
industry resulting from contact with
these chemical agents, followed by an
exposure of the criminal negligence of
the operators in controlling dust and
fumes, is urgently needed.

An exposure of these conditions that '
result in the death and shortened lives
of thousands of men each year could
unite and solidify the membership and
insure a victory for the union's just
demand for the establishment of the
occupational disease fund. I

1953' DEMANDS

Can we prevent hike
« in rates when - ’

plan takes effect?

, It is true that in some cases
where doctors and hospitals know
that a worker’s expenses are cov-
ered wholly or in part by an in-
surance plan, they increase .their
rates so that the worker is still
forced to pay something-out of
his pocket.

This tendency can only be pre-
ventedby an intelligent program
of education carried on by the
Union and its members. When a
plan is to go into effect, there
should be frank discussions with
the local physicians and hospi-
tals. Wherever possible, agree-

doctors and the hospitals to
charge fees not in excess of those
provided by the insurance com-
pany plan-.

This has been successfully ac-
complished in numerous commu-
nities. It should be made clear to
the doctors and hospitals that
overcharges or abuse of the pro-
gram 'might result in its failure.

Such a failure would not only
be harmful to the workers, but
also to those who supply medical

BEATON, B. C.—Manager of the
Sunshine Lardeau .mi,ne here is using
some peculiar rarguments to delay ne-
gotiations with Local 920, Lardeau'&
-District Mine '& Mill iWorkers"Union.
He says he is in no position to bargain,

_ and must take each proposal to a wide-

ly scattered board of directors, that his
only function in negotiations is to
bring the company and the bargaining
committee “closer together.” '
This is in defiance ofithe provincial
labor laws, ‘which stress definitely the
difference between the role of. “nego-
tiator,” and that of “conciliator” which
the manager, P.‘ L. Clark, ,yentui-es to
_assnme. ' ' ,
Such delaying tactics by Clark have
,stalled negoﬁations for some time, as-
sisted by his absence from the prop-
erty, but ‘the local has requested the_

This was James Maher, of Butte,‘
and doubtless the “Alanna” is O’Ca1la-
han’s tribute to a brother Gael.

Then Governor (Joa-tes wandered in,
and what is to many themystery of
the quill is revealed. He had just,
signed a “Liability Act,” (presumably
some kind of Workmen’s Compensa-
tion) and he presented “the assembled.
artists with the ‘quill’ with which the
Act was signed.” It was unanimously
adopted, and incorporated on the
emblemas symbolizing Education, and
is thus described by O’Callahan:

'?The Devil lGeorge Pettibonel laid

down the gold hammer. , 

As he did l’ong ago up in "Gem".

And "Woe Davie" stepped in "mid ‘the

clamor ' ~ _

Maybe some brother c-an enlighten
us on the significance of the “Gem’
reference. 0

“The ‘Artist’,’ continues O’Callahan,
“having supplied the paper and copied
the suggestions as they -were offered,
was thenper-mitted to exercise his own
ability, and with the story of Angela
ringinglin his ears, at one stroke com-
pleted the magie circle, and to the
anccious and ‘waiting world was sub-
mitted a Button, that brought the

THE STEPPED-UP CAMPAIGN of private cor-
porations to “move in” on the atomic power field~was
noted by Sen. Henry Jackson‘ (Dem., Washington)
when he said, “the grab ‘for offshore -oil is only an
opening gun in a widespread attack on~our nation’s

. resources.” And he pointed to atomic energy as one
_“of the most important’oAf"these resources.‘
_ “It is important that we not grant a private
 monopoly (over this form of energy,” Jackson said,
explaining "the tremendous opportunities for low-cost
, power in this field. " i
,'The CIO spoke up in protest as the Joint Com-
mittee on Atomic Energy began its /hearings on ‘the
,- handover proposal-s.
_ , For more than 10 years, you*and I have been con-
rtributing to the multi-billion dollar pool of tax moneys
that ‘has been used ‘to build. atomic energy plants,
{ know-how, and to develop this new field. Now the
pnoposat is that we turn_ over) the investment we have
fmade through our government to a fewgiant private

Signs of Eisen‘how'er‘s position
_, There is a host of signs that President Eisenhower

is-heartily in favor of the Big Steal:
‘ —Eisenhower backed the offshore oil handover

ing it more qiiickly. ~
‘—Eisenhower appointed Douglas McKay, an open
backer of the private "utility interests, to be Secre-
tary of Interior. As ‘assistant Interior Secretary he
" appointed" Fred’ Aandahl ex-governor of North
Dakota, even though Aandahl had said in a speech
r _(Valley City, N.*D‘,,' ‘May 19, 1952): .“I am against
public power. That is correct.” ’
"—Eisenhower appointed as another assistant In-
terior Secretary Orme Lewis, Arizona Utility execu-
tive, who now is in charge of the Bureau of Land

.-rmittee that the long-range policy of the federal
to private citizens.” ’ AA
»——Eisenhower sent a special message to Congress
recommending sale of what he said was $560 million‘
worth of Government-owned synthetic rubber ,pl_ans.
Actually, the Government .spent $750 million -to build
lthese plants during the war. Last year they produced
/_ 806,000 tons out of the total of 1,260,000 tons of new
rubber turned out in this country. '

—Eisenhower gave the “go-ahead” signal for sale
of the Inland Waterways Corporation, Government-
owned barge line which had been serving the nation
’since‘ World War I. . A AA -

--Eisenhower’s appointee, Director Albert Cole of

H the Housing &- Home Finance -Agency, is speeding
.,, the disposal to. private realty interests of 280,000
war-built housing units still under government
Aownership. ‘ A A .

A Already up for sale to “private enterprise” are such
‘model housing communities as Greenbelt, Maryland;

Wlabor shelters. '  ' « ~ »

With a perfectly straight face, U. S.” News &:

the Big Business crowd would like to take over—at

$49.3 billion worth of insurance. the face value of all
insurance policies now held by veterans.

18.6 billion in loans. to farmers. homeowners. miners.

-WHO'S BEHIND the Big Steal?
» Big Business, of course! a "
The lobbyists who spent huge sums in the campaign
to grease the Oil Steal through Congress represented
the biggest monopoly corporations in the oil industry.

The lobbyists behind the brazen attempt to steal our —
federal power projects speak for the big private util-
ity companies backed by the National Association of
Ma'nuafcturers and the U. S. Chamber of Commerce.
Sen. Warren Magnuson (Dem., Washington) charges
(May 15) that the Eisenhower Adminis'tratioAn is
scheming “to make the resources of the West a grab-
bag for eastern corporations and Wall Street under-

.. writers.”_ _ _ A, -‘

Senator Magnuson called the Hell’s Canyon give-
away to the Idaho Power Company “the juiciest power
plum in the United States.” Of the 10 biggest stock-

‘holders, he said, nine are eastern companies and one is
from.Los, Angeles.

‘Chamber of Commerce behind grub

Behind the grab at the national forests and grazing
lands are not only the big business stockmen, whose
ranches cover thousands of acres, but also the_ U. S.
‘Chamber of Commerce. There is no attempt to conceal
the fact that the D’Ewart Grazing Land Steal bill was

‘ drafted by the Stockmen’s' Grazing Committee, made
up of representatives of the major associations of big
cattle and sheep barons. ' /

One tip-off on the aim of the Big Steal can be seen
in the fact that more than 40 natural gas companies
now‘ have applications pending before the Federal
Power_Commission for rate increases totalling more
than $170,000,000 a year. Thishis the amount they want

" added to -the consumer’s gas bill in one way or an,

'other—and this is just a start. /
A'.IN ALMOST EVERY C’ASE the Big Businessmen
who are plugging -hardest for the Big Steal are the
very ones appointed by_,President Eisenhower t_o_'key

positions in. his .Administration—Interior Secretary .

Douglas McKay, Defense Secretary Charles (GM) Wil-
son, Commerce Secretary Sinclair Weeks, Agriculture
Secretary Ezra Taft Benson, ‘-"Treasury ‘Secretary
"George Humphrey. ‘ ' _ ‘

Interior Secretary -McKay is very blunt about it.
The Eisenhower Administration is “a business man’s
admim'st/ration,” he recentlytold the U. St’ Chamber
of Commerce. “We.’7:e in the saddle as an Adminis-
tration 'represent'£'ng busz'fness cont?-'ivn.dzcst’1'y.”

But before we can stop it, we must understand just
how far they intend. to go with their “legal” piracy.

' Then we must get busy to mobilize everyone in our
Mine-Mill communities to fighti It’s going to be .3.

A ple le haveever. waged. Senator Morse of Oregon com-

" nlents: “I want to say to the Liberals in the Senate

‘ that the time has come to fight as we have never

‘The St. Louis Post—Dispatch declared after the
heroic stand of a handful of. Senators against the Off“
shore Oil Steal that “a lot has been gained . L . count-
less citizensyhave-Acome to kiiow for the first time what
is involved. These. citizens know now who is giving"
away their heritage and who is fighting to save that
heritage from exp1oitation.”A 

And pointing to thefact, that the Oil Steal remains
to be tested in the Supreme Court, _the Post-Dispatch

added: A A
_ “.This fight‘ already has a sure p‘lac'e in history.”

have to give up children

WASHINGTON —— (FP) — Many mothers,
driven by sheer economic necessity into de- 

fense plants and other employment, are being‘, ' 
forced to give up their children because there i  

are no facilities to care for the‘ youngsters: "
.while the mothers are on the job, a study by
the Labor Dept. Women’s Bureau revealed. A
The startling disclosure is made in a book- 
let, Employed Mothers & Child Care, based on
a study of conditions in 28 industrial centers. -
in 12 states. The study said conditions in these
areas are typical of defense production cent,e’rs_ .
throughout the-country. , S
“In almost all areas,” the booklet said, “the

existing agencies (for day care of children) -~ 

have waiting lists sometimes two or three _
times as great as the capacity of service. In 9’ I
many places these centers ate always over-
crowded. . .

“In some cities an increased "demand for
foster home care of children has been noted
by welfare agencies, and this usually is at-
tributed to the fact that mothers who have to
work are unable to find suitable day care.”

THE WELFARE AGENCIES also noted
that. increased ‘living costs in 1951 and 1952
forced many mothers who formerly did not

°work to join the labor force. The report
’ showed that many‘ mothers who have worked _
are denied unemploymentcompensatiolt: when
S a change in hours or location of work makes‘
' it impossible for them to continue.

“Mothers were being disqualified for un-
employment compensation if they refused to
work because, due to some change in family
situation, location or working hours, they no
longer could find suitable child care to enable 
them to continue working, yet no account was
taken of how their families could subsist with-
out their wages,” the report said. ’

In many of the areas, school authorities --
reported many children who formerly went
home to lunch were now remaining at school.
The YWCA said many older ‘children were
taking younger brothers. and sisters with them~—'
to Y functions because the youngsters had no
place else to go and no one at home to‘ care
for them. -

Women’s Bureau Dir. Frieda S. Miller eth-

.',..

phasized the magnitude and critical naturéof ' ‘ 

the problem by citingthe growing“number.of"'A
working mothers each year. ‘Thenumber grew-

) from 1.5 million in‘1940 to 5.2 million in 1951. . A
A In. the latter year 24% of all mothers worked. -
fora living. Mothers comprised 28% of all I
women in the labor force. ' _ _ 

‘IN ADDITION to the economic factors?‘

that drive mothers to work, the report said,-' .
the country’s need for a greater’number"of';‘i '
workershas caused an increase in the nurr_1-W
her of working mothers. The report sho’we,d_’A-..
that the government, however, has “made. ;’no'__"
plans for caring for thelchildren even though’
indications are that more mothers will be, re.-‘<_ .
cruited into factories, thishyear. ‘ .  9  ~

The report showed that even ,dm-ihg 

war years, federally aided child care ‘centers i‘
took care of only 600,000 children, a fraction:
of the need. Most of these care centers were 5
forced to, close after the war‘ when federal-
funds were wihtdrawn. _ , - 

v _With the number of working mothers _much"-:<r
greater in 1951.t_han during the -war, the nun_1.- ’
ber of care centers remained pitifully inade-
quate, the report showed. School, church and’-I
civic welfare ‘agencies’ in cities studied. it said,“-
were aware of the problem but had takenfonly
halting preliminary steps to meet‘it. 

Unemployment‘ still serious. 0
in -34 U.S. industfiol areas

WASHINGTON (FP)——The’ Labor Dept. an-
nounced that 34 industrial areas in the U.
- still-have a substantial labor surplus and'a-re
i-n line for government help to ease unemployl

Despite the normal seasonal upturn in_e

 C/ampaign breaks 95-year

.lim Crow at N. J. brewery

NEWARK, N. J. (FP_)-—A campaign
by the New Jersey Negro Labor Coun-
cil forced the Krueger Brewery Co, to

, hire; Negro workers for the first time
'__in its 95-year‘ history.

The campaign began .in February

1953,when council officials met with
the company to demand that Negro
production workers be hired. Krueger
was chosen as the starting point be-
cause its brewery is locatedina Negro
"_community., A. '

Company officials said’; they were
“sympathetic” to’ the demand but
stalled on » actually hiring Negroes.
'1‘hree months later‘ the council warned
Krueger that it wouldlaunch a com-
munity boycott of its beer and post

_picketlines at the‘ brewery unless the
‘policy was ‘changed. __ I

The company requesteda meeting
withthe council and announced it had
hired two Negro produ-tion workers.
The council issued a statement describ-
ing the victory as “,o1,.,, the beg’ -
ning” and said -it wou" press for

._model clauses barring" discrimination
,_in. all contracts with New Jersey brew-
’ eries. ' V

Time for a change _
Median wage in 1950' for men work-
ers in U. S. manufacturing was $3,117.

Median wage for women workers was
only $1,832.

WASHINGTON (FP)—The U. S.

that restaurants in the Dist. of Colum-

was a triumph for 91-year-old Mary
Church Terrell, noted Negro educator,

WINSTON/- SALEih,« N. C. (FP)——-
Two thousand people crowded into Un-
ion/ Baptist church May 31 to" attend
funeral services for 22-year-old Clyde
Brown, executed in the state’s gas
chamber at Raleigh two days earlier.
In Windsor, a big crowd also turned
out at the funeral of Raleigh Speller,
51, executed with Brown.

The mourners, most of them Negroes
who wor in the local tobacco‘ shops,
as Brown once did, heard Rev. A. H.
McDaniels in his funeral service de-
clare the young victim and the Negro

' people “don’t owe society nearly as

much as society owes us.”

.Bi°iown and Speller were convicted
by all-white "juries on charges of rap-
ing white“ women. Both maintained
their innocence ‘until -the end. -Speller,
convicted on three separateoccasions
by juries from which Negroes -were
excluded, had been in jail since‘ 1947,
Brown since 1950.

Among the Negro students who
maintained a vigil before the Capitol
building -was Mildred Wagstaff. A

' student of Shaw University in Raleigh,
Miss Wagstaff was raped at gunpoint
in 1950 by a white man. It took a mass
campaign in the Negro communities to
get the rapist arrested and indicted.
He was sentenced to from eight to 10
years in prison. \_

The Terrell ‘group forced a nori-poi

Most Washington restaurants‘ contin-

BAYARD‘, N. M.—Una eleccion que
la AFL habia anticipado como un suc-
 . eso de mayor importancia fué ganada
5 .el dia ?..de junio por la Union Interna-
cional de Trabajadores en Minas,
Molinos y Fundiciones. Los electores
fueron los empleados de la Division
Empire Zinc de la empresa New Jersey
Company, en Hanover, New Mexico.
Los resultados fueron Mine-Mill 53;
,_.AFL 27; ninguna 4. Esto fuo anun-
if ciado por Juan Chacon, presidente de
‘la Local 890 de Mine-Mill con sede
en Bayard, New Mexico. ’ ‘

Mine-Mill ha sido la agencia de ne-
gociacion en esta propiedad _desde
1943. La eleccion el dia 2 'de junio fué
.'el primer disparazo en un esfuerzo
nuevo por parte del Concilio de Ofi-
cios Met-alurgicos AFL en un “raid”
(incursion) contra la membrecia de
Mine-Mill. ‘

E1 21 de dia de mayo, Arturo B. Lo-
pez, representante general de la AFL en
Nuevo Mexigo y Arizona, anuncio en
Albuquerque, New Mexico, que la AFL
habia “emprendido una campaiia cos-
tosa para romper la fuerza de la Union
Internacional de Trabajadores en Mi-
nae, Molinos y Fundiciones” en la in-
dustria minera. Afiadio que “una vic-

Esto incluye‘ todo sobretiempo,

la empresa cede al trabajador africano
raciones valuadas de 200 diarios. ’
E Ante todas estas condiciones los
trabajadores-- de cobre africanos han
aprendido como" resistir. En 1935
salieron; en huelga contra un aumento
en el impuesto perca-pita._ =Las em-
presas provocaron “incidentes” que la
policia uso como preteito para disparar
contra los trabajadores, matando a
‘cinco. La huelga fué derrotada.

OTRA VEZ, ‘en 1940, 10s trabaja-—

dores salieron en huelga porel au-
mento de salarios. Esta vez un “inci-

I‘ dente” ~fabricado resultoen la- muerte

de 17 y 65 heridos. Otra vez se rompio
la huelga. ' M
Con esta experiencia, los dueﬁos de

’ las empresas mineras seutian que po-

dianreirse cuando, una, vez mas, Ios
trabajadores de cobre. africanos, em-
pezaron a organizarea la union.

Para octubre proximo pasado, la
Union de Mineros Africanos habia or-
‘ganizado 'a 30,000 trabajadores afri-
canos ‘en Copperbelt. Presentaron ante
las empresas deicobre la demanda por
un aumento de salario de 35c diarios.
Las empresas con desprecio anuncia-
ron que aumentarian Ios salaries a. 6c
diarios, pero .ni un centado mas. Los
trabajadores seﬁalaron las fantastica-
mente‘ ‘ascendiendo . ganancias de las em-
presas de cobre. __ I

FUERON rontestados por el revista
de finanzas britanico, The Economist
(10/25/52), que reportoz‘

“La dernanda de la Union del Mineros
Africanos por 35c por" pueble doblaria
el salario. Si las gananciasktfueran el
solo cr-iterio, las empresaspudieran pa-
gar -mas,” pero. estas (las empresas)
sostienen que a los, africanos sé les
esta pa_ga'ndo" todo lo que es justo de
acuerdo‘ con el trabajo-que hacen.” ’

, Ante esta -actitud increib_l.~. de parte
las-empresas, la Union tomo un voto de

huelga. 23,538 miembros Lfavorecieronjd

WASHINGTON, D. C. -- Warning:
Don't be fooled by statements out of
this capitol city that Congress “won’t
act at this session” on a'i1ti—labor bills.
' - Such ‘a statement was made the oth-
er day by Sen‘. Robert Taft when he

‘predicted Congressional adjournment
byVJuly 31. .'I‘aft and Senator Labol‘

Committee Chairman Alexander Smith '

have proposed a series of sweeping.

changes to the Taft-Hartley act. Taft_ ‘

‘said he thinks the Committee ‘should
report out A bill along these "lines,
‘fand let‘ it sit there---‘all sux1}l“@1'**
ready to go next winter.” 1 l 7
Committee Cl1_aii'lriai\ Smith made a

-similar statement that “only a mira"c1e-"
can bring action on the_ anti-labor. bills

before Congress folds up for tl1e sum—.

,nT‘er. But at the same time’ big business

is reydoubling .its drive for fast action"

' The Srnith statement was a com- S
