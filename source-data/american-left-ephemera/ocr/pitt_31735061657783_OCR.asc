America Can ’t Have Both.’

Testimony against the Mundt-
Nixon Bill (H.R. 7595)>before the
House Un-American Activities
Committee, May 2, 1950, by a
spokesman for the Communist Party

by SIMON W. GERSON

 

 

‘What Do Communists Stand For?

As a consequence of this creeping pattern of repression and
slander, it has become more diﬂicult for people to ‘ﬁnd out the
true fundamental aims of the Communist Party._I therefore
think it appropriate at this time to state the basic aim of the
Communist Party as set forth in its ‘Constitution, binding upon
all its members:

“The Communist Party upholds the achievements
of American democracy and defends the United St.ates
Constitution and its Bill of Rights against its reac-
tionary enemies who would destroy democracy and
popular liberties. It uncompromisingly ﬁghts against
imperialism and colonial oppression, against racial,
national and religious discrimination, against Jim-
Crowism, anti-Semitism and all forms of chau-
vinism. . . . .

"The Communist Party recognizes that the ﬁnal
abolition of exploitation and oppression, of economic
crises and unemployment,‘ of reaction and War, will
be achieved only by the socialist reorganization of
society-—by the common ownership and operation of
the national economy under a government of the
people led by the Working class.

"The Communist Party, therefore, educates the
working class, in the course of its day-to-day strug-
gles, for its historic mission, the establishment of
Socialism. Socialism, the highest form of democracy,
will guarantee the full realization of the right to ‘life,
_liberty and the pursuit of happiness,’ and will turn
the achievements of labor, science and culture to _the
use and ‘enjoyment of all men and Women.”

‘Can't Import or Export Socialism

The Communist Party states ﬂatly that it has no higher
allegiance than to the people of the United States and the
10

‘/-

sovereign powerthat resides in the American people. Under
all circumstances, " we loyally defend the genuine national
interests of our people. We affirm that no basic social change
can come in our country except by the will of the American
people. We know that socialist reorganization of society cannot
be imported or exported. It cannot be imposed upon the
American people by a minority group or by force and violence.
Only the American people—above all, the producers, the
workers * and farmers of America-—can make‘ such decisions.
I now want to address myself to one special feature of the
bill: the registration feature. This is frequently advanced by
proponents of the measure as simply a disclosure section‘,
designed to place Communists on a par with Republicans and
Democrats in respect to disclosure. L‘ '
This reveals a vast ignorance of the activities of the Com-
munist Party. As one who has been a campaign manager and
,a Communist candidate, I can testifyaof my personal knowl-
edge that the Communist Party has complied with every law,
rule and regulation in respect to disclosure of its political
activities. For example, in 1946 it ran candidates for office in

my state,‘ ﬁled «petitions of voters, ﬁnancial records, and in

every way complied‘ with the election law governing inde-
pendent political organizations. This was accomplished in the
face of numerous legal and extra-legal diﬂiculties.

I might add pare_nthetically, gentlemen, that one of the
diﬂiculties was the actual physical violence we met,in' the
peaceful pursuit of canvassing for signatures, and also the
knowledge that the signatures would wind up in the ﬁles of
this committee. It is a matter of record in your recent report
that you ‘have photostatic copies of signatories to ‘the 1946
nominatingtpetitions in New York State. '

Up to 1936' in New York the "Communist Party was ofﬁcially
on the ballot and took part in both primary and general
elections; It was not we, but the State Legislature in New

York—like legislative bodies in other states—who persistently:

adopted restrictive legislation narrowingfurther and further
the political ﬁeld for Communists and other political
IIl1I10I‘lt1_€S.

Who Is Really Destroying
Democratic Rights?

This helps answer the question: Who is destroying political
liberty in our country? '

It is not the Communists who pass restri-ctive election laws
in the various states. It is not the Communists who are respon-
sible for the anti-democratic poll tax. It is not the Communists
who are responsible for the continuance of the crime of lynch-
ing. It is not the Communists wh-'0 maintain the nation's
capital as a Jim-Crow city in which men -like Ralph Bunche
and Paul Robeson cannot eat, sleep and live like free citizens.
It is not -the Communists who ﬁlibuster against F.E.P.'C. and
a civil rights program and prevent the democratic aspirations
of the people from coming to a vote. It is not the Communists
who pass anti—labor Taft-Hartley laws. It is not the Commu-
nists who becloud the discussion of foreign policy with a_
McCarthyian madness.

Say what you will about the Communists, they didn’t invent
the right freely to teach and advocate one’s political views.
That freedom is historically embodied in the Declaration of
Independence and the Bill of Rights and is an article of faith
of all democratic Americans, irrespective of political outlook.
It was not the Communists but the Founding Fathers who
declared that “whenever any government becomes destructive”
of certain inalienable rights, “it is the right of the people to
alter it.” It was not a Communist but Abraham Lincoln who
said: “This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people
who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing
government, they can exercise their constitutional right of
amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or
overthrow it.”

It was not a Communist leader but the venerable Justice
Holmes who said (Bran-deis concurring) in a memorable dis-
sent (Gitlow v. People of New York, 268 U.S. 652):

"If, in the long run, the beliefs expressed in the
proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted
12

I},

'3

I

by the dominant forces of the community, the only
meaning of free speech is that they should be given
their chance and have their Way.”

It is not we Communists who are responsible for the dimin-
ishing of avenues of political expression in our nation. It is
not we Communists who fear the marketplace of public
opinion where the various programs for peace, security and
democracy can be placed before the sovereign American
people. In brief, gentlemen, it is not we Communists who are
turning our backs on the traditions of Holmes and Brandeis,
Jefferson and Lincoln. It is the proponents of the Mundt bill.

Bill Seeks to Stiﬂe Pectce Fight C

The Communist Party opposes the Mundt bill in principle
because we seek not the closing of the avenues of public

‘ expression but their widest and most democratic extension.

We are for a free and ‘public debate of foreign policy, of the
sinister re-naziﬁcation of Germany, of the outlawing of the

H- and A-bombs, of a top level conference with the Soviet

Union looking toward a durable peace. ,

We are for these things because we are profoundly con-
vinced that a. third world war is not inevitable and that there
can be peaceful co-existence of and comlpetitio-n between
capitalism and socialism. We are profoundly convinced that
if these issues are freely and frankly dis-cussed with the ‘facts
before them the American people will express themselves
overwhelmingly for peace and against the present Truman-
Dulles-Acheso-n bi-partisan war policies, which differ only in
tempo and degree from those of Senator McCarthy and his
friendsylt is precisely the chief purpose of the Mundt-Nixon
bill to stifle this vast, mass expression of the American people
for peace. .

We wish at this time to re-aﬂirm our oft—repeated warnings:

any measure aimed at destroying the rights of Communists

and alleged Communists will inevitably wind up by destroying

the civil rights of all. This point was well made by an eminent
13

Catholic ﬁgure, the late Father John M. Ryan, during a period
of anti-Red hysteria immediately after World War I. At that
time, it may be recalled, ﬁve Socialist assemblymen were
brutally expelled from the New York State Legislature on
much the same charges of “conspiracy” and “foreign agent”
now levelled against the Communists. In a letter to the
Socialist defense in 1920, Father Ryan wrote:

"Possibly my desire to see your personal cause tri-
umph—meaning this cause before you-—-is not alto-
gether unselﬁsh. For I see quite clearly that if the ﬁve
Socialist representatives are expelled from the New
York Assembly on the ground that they belong to and
avow loyalty to an organization which the autocratic
majority regards as inimical to the best interests of
the State, a bigoted majority in a State——say, in
Georgia——may use the action as a precedent to keep
out of that body regularly elected_ members who I
belong to the Catholic Church, for there have been
majorities in the Legislature of more than one South-
ern state that have looked upon the Catholic Church
exactly as Speaker Sweet looks upon the Socialist
Party.”

The moral is valid today. Bigotry breeds bigotry. And the
anti—Communist hysteria today is unleashing anti-democratic,
anti-Negro, anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic forces in our nation,
even as the Hitlerian anti-communism bred the same type of
forces in Germany. The defeat of the Mundt-Nixon bill will
be a big blow at all these anti-democratic forces in our life.

Party Won't Perjure Itself by Registering

In closing, I would like to reaﬂi-‘rm my Party's position in
the event of this bill's passage by quoting from the testimony
of William Z. Foster, national chairman of the Communist
Party, before the Senate judiciary Committee on t-he Mundt
bill, May 28, 1948:

14

_V._?. ‘R

—-¢+ AT-“Lg.

“If the Mundt-Nixon bill were to pass, the Com-
munist Party would not perjure itself by admitting
any resemblance to the monstrous caricature of its
nature and purposes drawn in this bill. It would not
dishonor the 1 5,000 members of our party who fought
against fascism in World War II by giving de facto
sanction to Hitler’s big lie. That is one reason why we
would refuse to register.

"Furthermore, as a party of patriotic and loyal
Americans, we could not and would not become
accomplices to the murder of the Bill of Rights. That
is another reason why we would not register. And
ﬁnally, we would not register because we will never
expose our members to persecution, ostracism, and
blacklisting in employment.”

But no matter what the fate of this particular piece of legis-
lation, the Communist Party reaﬂirms its complete conﬁdence
in (the American people, who will never submit to fascist

slavery nor abandon the ﬁght against a civilization-destroying

atomic war. We are conﬁdent that the American working class,
of which the Communist Party is an organi-c and leading part,
will lead the American people to a destiny of peace, progress,
security and friends-hip with all nations.

We are supremely conﬁdent that the dark hours will end
and, in ]efferson’s moving words, “we shall see the reign of
the witches . . . pass over and the people recovering their
true right.” '

About the Author

SIMON W. GERsoN is the legislative chairman of the New York
Communist Party. A former legislative correspondent and
city editor of the Daily Worker, he was assistant to the Bor-
ough President of Manhattan in the LaGuardia Administra-
tion in New York. Running in 1948 for the Council seat of
the late Communist Councilman Peter V. Cacchione, Gerson
received 15o;ooo total votes on the Communist and American
Labor party lines. He is a combat infantry veteran of World
W'ar II, having seen service in the Paciﬁc:

Asked the $64 question about his party afﬁliation—the
House Committee knew, of course, that Gerson represented
the Communist Party—Gerson answered:

“Apart from the patent absurdity of the question, the
answer to which is self-evident, sir, I wish to state for the
record that I am a member of the Communist Party, that
I have been for some time, and that I intend to be one."

Subsequently in the hearing Gerson added: “In giving my
answer to counsel's question as to my own membership in the
Communist Party . . . I do so under protest, not conceding
the constitutional right of the committee to inquire into my
political afﬁliations, and I would like that to appear in the
record.”

He is presently a member of the Communist Party's Public
Affairs Committee.

Y NAME IS SIMON‘ W. GERSON. I represent the Communist
M Party in opposition to the Nixon bill, H.R. 7595, the
companion measure to the Mundt-Ferguson-Johnston bill in
the Senate, S. 2311. ' _

The Communist Party wishes _to associate itself in general
with the nation-wide opposition already registered against the
bill,—~that ofthe. whole labor movement, A. F. of L., C.I.O.,
Railway Brotherhoods and independent unions; the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored _ Peoples, the
American Jewish Congress, the, American Civil Liberties
Union, Americans for Democratic Action, the American Vet-
erans Committee, the National Farmers Union, the Women's
International League _for Pea-ce and Freedom,-* the Association
of the .Bar of the City of New York, the National Lawyers
Guild; -Governor Bonner of Montana, Governor Johnson of
Colorado; the noted constitutional authorities, Professor
Zechariah Chafee of Harvard Law School, Prof. Fowler
Harper~of,Yale Law School, and Prof. William Gorham Rice

of Wisconsin; suchtdistinguished citizens as President Robert

Hutchins of the University of Chicago and Councilman
Stanley M. Isaacs, Republican minority leader of the New

York City‘ Council; religious groups like the Episcopal League p

for Social Action and the Friends (Quakers) Committee on
National Legislation; Bishop Francis Haas of Grand Rapids,
Mich.; the more than 20 major newspapers which have edi-
torially opposed this bill; and the thousands of local groups
which have condemned the measure. .

Probably no single measure before -the 81st Congress has
evoked such a ﬂood of opposition, cutting across all partisan,
regional and denominational lines, as has the Mundt-Nixon
bill. Parenthetically, we would like to observe that even on

(\
u)

 

   

the basis of sheer ﬁgures, any representative bodypwould do
well to reject out of hand a measure so clearly opposed by the
majority of the country.

This nation-wide, non-partisan oppositio-n is not accidental.
It is reﬂective of the fact that millions of Americans and labor
in the ﬁrst instance regard this bill correctly not as a threat
to the Communists alone but to the ancient liberites of all
Americans. It reﬂeots the fact that despite the cold war hysteria
and the McCarthyian miasma over Washington, the lessons
of fascism in Italy and Germany are not lost upon millions
of Americans.

Only “Began" With Communists

In those nations the destruction of all democratic rights
began with the attack “only” upon -Communists. But with
remorseless logic the attack soon enveloped and destroyed all
who stood in any way for peace andidemocraticp rights——the
trade unions, the Socialists, the Jews, the Catholics and the
liberals of all faiths.

History now recognizes that the destruction of civil rights
at home was only the domestic phase of fascism’s program
of aggressive war abroad. Without silencing every voice for
peace and democracy, it would ‘have been impossible for
Hitler and Mussolini to wage war upon their neighbors. To
wage aggressive war one must substitute guns for bu-tter; one
must destroy free trade unions and those who ﬁght for peace.
This is an iron law of history which millions of Americans
voicing opposition to the Mundt bill are beginning to realize.

Despite all legalistic tinkering, the Mundt-Nixon bill suffers
about every major constitutional inﬁrmity in the calendar.
It is vague, indeﬁnite, destructive of due process, a bill of
attainder and in outright violation of constitutional guaran-
tees of free speech, free thought and ‘free association. It
ﬂagrantly substitutes guilt by association for the historic
American doctrine of personal guilt. Above all, it seeks to
deprive the sovereign people of their right of free political

4

choice and therefore negates the very basic concept on which
American representative democracy was founded.

If enacted into law, it would effectively close the legal
avenues of expression by which the American people under
the constitution effect social and political change. It would,
in our opinion, even make impossible the type of change in
national political direction voted by the people in 1932 by

effectively blocking the possibility for the legal existence of a

national movement like the New Deal.

Gentlemen, today I don’t want to discuss the legal and
constitutional questions in detail. I prefer to deal with the
broad question of public policy.

Either the Constitution—or Mundt Bill

The [constitutional inﬁrmities to which we refer‘ are inherent
in the ‘purposes of the bill and no amount of re-drafting can
eliminate them. Any bill which seeks such objectives will
necessarily do force and violence to the American Constitution
and the Bill of Rights.

Let us therefore understand the issue clearly: the United
States can have the Constitution or it can have the Mundt-
Nixon bill. It can’t have both.

For the Mund-t bill is the very opposite of traditional Ameri-
can democratic rights. It marks the boundary line from which
we as a nation slip over from capitalist democracy to ‘a fascist
dictatorship. And this dictatorship is made no sweeter by
reason of the fact that it ‘is introduced in legislative form
rather than by a black-shirted mob or a man on horseback.
The history of every country where fascism was introduced-
Italy, Germany, Spain——shows the same startling parallel. Fas-
cism always “began”, with the destruction of the rights of the
Communist Party. It always preceded its destruction of all
popular rights with the smokescreen of the “ﬁght against
Communism.” Contrariwise, those nations in which capitalist
democracy, however limited, still exists and fascism has not
come to power, there the Communist Parties continue to exist

5

  

 

as legal _entities.., Those countries include England, France,
Italy, Belgium,‘ Holland, Finland, the Scandinavian countries,
and. even Japan. , .

Ironically, enough, Japan, home of the original “thought
control” police, still formally accepts the underlying premises
of our Bill of Rights, while some members of our Congress
are prepared to destroy them. A Tokyo dispatch in the New
York Times of Feb. .14, 1950 quotes Japanese.‘ Attorney Gen-
eral Shunkiohi Ueda as insisting that prosecutions against
radicals can be undertaken only against overt acts, and not
against ideas. “The law can be invoked only if. ideas are
translated into action,” Mr. Ueda is quoted as saying. . .

No such inhibition is’ present in the Mundt-Nixon bill.
Men and women can be jailed simply for belonging to. certain
organizations. And who is to decide what organizations and
what actions of an organization “substantially contribute to
the creation within the United States-of a totalitarian dicta-
.torship’.’?~ A politically—appointed Subversive Activities Control
Board is‘ to decide. ' . -- v ‘ - ' v

This Board could easily decide, for example, that the miners
union was “substantially contributing” to the creation of a
‘totalitarian dictatorship by a strike. Senator Kilgore correctly
made. the point in his statement of March 6th last that the
Mundt bill, which is in effect a sedition law, could ‘be used
against organized labor. And what organization « ﬁghting for
peace, civil liberties, Negro rights, the needsiof labor, for
public housing or against discrimination, could-: not at some
time or other be penalized by such a board? It is a matter-of
record, for. example, that there are even real estate*represen-
tatives who charge that ‘supporters -of ‘public housing are
“substantially contributing” to socialism in our "country.

Only last Wednesday, April 26, Edwin S. Friendly, president
of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, attacked
‘-the so-called “welfare state” and “Communism disguised as
democratic socialism.-” .What chance would any organization
advocating progressive, New Deal, or even Fair Deal measures
have before a Board of which Mr. Friendly or one of his stripe
was a ‘member? ’ -

A Cold War Bill

This bill cannot be separated from the bi-partisan cold war
atmosphere in which it arises. This bill is simplythe domestic
expression of the bi—partisan war drive of the Administration
and its Republican allies. It is, in short, a cold war measure.
As Senator McCarthy and his followers would speed the time-
table of the aggressive war drive of Wall Street and the Big
Brass, so would this bill speed the timetableof destruction of
civil liberties at home. The bill might well be described as
Senator McCarthy’s ravings in legislative form. If this bill
becomes law, guilt by association and hanging by hearsaywill
become commonplace features of American life. _ _

, If this bill were enac-ted into law, we would have what
Congressman Edward Livingstone so prophetically warned us
against in his historic speech against the Alien and Sedition
Laws in the Congressional debates at theiclose of the 18th

century. We repeat Congressman Liyingstone’s warning:

" “The "countryvwill ‘swarm with informers, spies,
delatorsv, and all the odious reptile tribe . . . the hours
of ’ the most unsuspected conﬁdence, the intimacies of
friendship, or: the recesses of domestic retirement,‘ 
afford no ‘security. The companion Whom you must '
trust, the friend in whom you must conﬁde, the
domestic who Waits in your chamber, are all tempted

A to betray your ‘imprudent or unguarded follies; to
misrepresent your words; to convey them, distorted ,
by calumny, to the secret tribunal where jealousy

' presides—-where fear loﬂiciates as accuser, and suspi-
cion is the only evidence that is heard. . . . Do not let
usbbe told that we are to excite a fervor against a’
‘foreign aggression to establish a tyranny at home. . . .”

, While the Mundvt-Nixon bill is opposed by millions of

Americans, the overwhelming majori-tyof whom are non-=

Communists who understand that their democratic rights are
in jeopardy, it is also increasingly recognized that this bill

7

 

  
 

seeks to outlaw the Communist Party. Let there be -no mistake
about this. N 0 one is fooled by the shabbily transparent legal
gimmick in the bill, in which the Communist Party is referred
to as a “Communist political organization.” -There is only
one “Communist -political organization” in the United States
and that is the Communist Party.\It shouldbe clear, therefore,
to the entire country that the measure is in fact an unconsti-
tutional bill of attainder aimed, among other objectives, at
outlawing the Communist Party.

C The Hitler Big Lies

On its par.t the Communist Party declares, the characteriza-
tion of the “Communist political organization” (read: “Com-
munist Party”) in Section 2 of the bill to be a series of gross
political falsehoods akin to the Hitler Big Lie under which
the Nazis plunged Germany into fascism and the world into
war. '

It is fantastically untrue that the Communist Party is a
conspiracy. It is an American politi-cal party whose roots go
back to the Civil War when American Communists served
loyally as leaders and rank-and—ﬁlers in t-he Union armies to
suppress the slave—owners’ rebellion against the Union‘. The
Communist Party was born out of the great movements for
Socialism, for trade unionism and for the liberation of the
Negro people in our country. It is a legitimate current in
American working-class life and will continue to be so long
as the struggle against capitalism exists. It will continue to
ﬁght for its legality under any and all -circumstances.

The allegation that the “Communist political organization”
(again, read: “Communist Party”) is a foreign agency is
equally fantastic and is belied by the very record of the gov-
ernment. For years there have been~on the statute books laws
directed against illegal foreign agents. The fact that in the
30 years history of the Communist Party there has not been
a single prosecution brought against it for violating these
laws belies this slanderous charge. It was not for lack of hos-
tility by the Department of Justice. -The fact is there was not-—

8

 

W-I . -'

 

~.._. . «I

 

and is not-—a single shred of evidence to prove this charge of

“foreign agent.”

Prof. Zechariah Chafee, in his communication on the
Mundt-Nixon bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee last
year, declared that he saw very little evidence to support the
recital in the bill that the “Communist movement presents
‘a clear and present danger . to the existence of free

American institutions.’ ” We go further and declare ﬂatly that

the Communist Party is neither a “clear and present danger”
nor an obscure and remote danger to American democratic

institutions. To the contrary, the Communist Party supports.

every move of the American people to maintain and extend
democratic achievements, from the right to vote at the ballot
box to the greatest democratic achievement possible-—Socialism
—-the common ownership and management of the means of
production and distribution of our nation. r

The Communist Party is probably the most viliﬁed and
persecuted organization in America today. It is slandered in

'the Congress, the public press and in virtually every other

agency of monopoly-controlled public communication. Its
members are generally ‘barred from public employment and
frequently discharged from private employment when their
views become known. It is a matter of common knowledge
that our telephones are tapped, our mails checked, _our private
lives investigated and government informers and agents pro-
vocateur sent into our organiations. (_This is, of course,
increasingly true for many other labor, progressive and inde-
pendent organizations.) Eleven Communist leaders have been
convicted in New York not for any overt acts but for “teaching
and advocating” the historic viewpoint of Marxist Socialism.
Communists have been penalized for publicly expressing their
views and, contrariwise, handed contempt sentences for refus-
ing to discuss their political alﬁliations or refusing to become
parties to the creation of blacklists. Thus the constitutional
guarantees of both speech and silence have been equally

violated for Communists. Finally, the Communists, like the:

Abolitionists of the last century, have at times become the
victims of actual physical terror.
