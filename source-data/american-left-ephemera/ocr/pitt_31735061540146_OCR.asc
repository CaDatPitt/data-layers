WHO WE ARE

The San Diego Coalition is made up of people from a wide variety
of local community groups, including G.I.’s, students, anti-war groups,
collectives, professionals, and underground newspapers. We are also
working with people across the country who share our political goals,
including the People’s Coalition for Peace and Justice, National
Lawyers Guild, Peace Action Council of L.A., and Anti-Imperialist
Coalition of the San Francisco Bay Area.

SDCC has evolved a very ﬂexible structure so it can meet rapidly
changing conditions. Anyone who agrees with our goals and principles
and who is active in one of its component parts (committee, task
force, or member collective) is a member of the Coalition. At present,
general membership meetings are held every week to consider policy
questions and do internal education. A Coordinating Committee,
made up of representatives selected by each of the component parts,
meets more frequently. There are also Third World and women’s
caucuses in SDCC.

Our political goals in confronting the G.O.P. are:

1) To demand an immediate end to all aspects of the war in
Indochina. Specifically to expose and stop the barbaric, escalating
technological air war and to demand acceptance of the Peace Plan of
the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam.

2) To expose and struggle against the increasingly unpopular domestic
policies forced upon the people of the U.S. by the existing economic
and political structure.

3) To mobilize a massive array of people united in their opposition to
the war and in their determination to take control of their own lives.
4) To accelerate the growth of ongoing movements capable of leading
and sustaining peoples’ struggles both locally and nationally.

We in the Coalition have agreed to work together according to the
following prinicples:

1) We will form the broadest possible coalition to nonviolently and
openly oppose and confront the Republican Party leadership. We seek
to build a strong radical movement that cannot be used or absorbed
by the Democratic Party and which will include: Third World people,
G.I.’s and veterans, working people, the unemployed, gay people,
women, students, and freaks.

2) In this coalition and in all the work we do we will reject and
struggle against all forms of domination based on race, sex, and class
exploitation. We will try to bring about in ourselves and in our
manner of working with one another those human changes which
must accompany political and economic changes in order for our
revolution to succeed. We will struggle against racism, sexism, and

8

 

 

 

 

class chauvinism in ourselves as well as in all others with whom we
work, and will seek continually to isolate and understand the root
causes of the tendencies in each of us to dominate, manipulate, and
control. Skills and experience will be shared broadly among members
of the coalition and a conscious effort made to provide opportunity
for those less experienced to grow stronger in revolutionary skills,
understanding, commitment, and confidence.

3) Because much of our strength will depend on massive numbers of
people coming to the city, we will make contact and work with
groups and individuals throughout the U.S., especially in the western
region.

We are engaged in an experiment with a new model for national
actions based on deep roots in the host community. As members of
San Diego groups we feel a responsibility to coordinate activities
taking place in San Diego during the Republican Convention. But our
commitment to San Diego does not end in August. It lasts far beyond.
A local movement is taking the initiative to organize a national action,
an action of international signiﬁcance. The challenge will be two-fold:
for the local movement to be ﬂexible and be able to incorporate new
people from other areas into the decision making process in a
democratic manner and for the people from other areas to have a
great sensitivity to the local situation, the work that has gone on
before they arrive and that will continue after August.

In this section we describe the Coalition’s relationships with
different constituencies to help you develop a, clear idea of our
politics.

Black People

Black people are the most politically advanced segment of the U.S.
population and, as such, are the biggest threat to reactionary like
Nixon. The San Diego ConventionsCoalition, a mostly White group,
considers building alliances with Black people to be one of its highest
priorities. There is a third-world caucus within SDCC to develop the
Whites’ consciousness about racism and to promote the priority of
linkage with Blacks.

The big inﬂux of Black people to Southern California began during
W.W.II. Black people are conﬁned mostly to the older sections of San
Diego and Los Angeles, where the housing is decaying, the schools
segregated, the public transportation minimal, and unemployment
huge. Like all immigrant populations, the Black communities are
young, restless, and impatient for an end to racist oppression. They
are a powderkeg.

The White power structure in Southern California has worked very
hard at counterinsurgency against Black people. Through provocateurs
and bribes, the notorious Los Angeles Police Department has been
able to use Blacks to tight Blacks. Two Black Panther leaders were
shot by other Blacks at a conference in L.A. and two other Black
Panthers were shot down in the streets of San Diego.

The police brutality continues day by day. It is common practice
in San Diego for police to round up Black youths off the street
whenever a major robbery occurs. “Suspects” are charged with the
crime, held on high bail, photographed for the newspaper, and then
released several days later for lack of evidence. In response to the
racism of the police department, a group of Black San Diego police
resigned en masse in 1969.

Both San Diego and Los Angeles have been leaders in using federal
money to subsidize big corporations in the exploitation of Black
workers. A growing industrial park in Watts hires unemployed men
and women at the minimum for work that would pay twice as much if
done by union labor. San Diego’s new mayor, Pete Wilson, advocates
this kind of industrial park for the southeast part of town, where
Black and Chicano people live. The racist attempts to exploit Black
workers have led to the rapid growth in Los Angeles of the Black
Workers Congress.

 

 

A special effort is made to attempt to isolate Black leaders from
their communities. This is done by providing a small number of
relatively high-paying jobs in government poverty programs and
private institutions. The power structure hopes that if they give a
Black militant a college degree and a $10,000 a year job he will forget
about the brothers and sisters on the block.

These techniques of counterinsurgency will work against the Black
people of Southern California about as well as they worked against
the Vietnamese. The rage of the people mounts day by day. It was
Southern California that produced Angela Davis, George Jackson and
Jonathon Jackson. After a Black man was murdered by Los Angeles
police Black people convened a People’s Tribunal that convicted and
condemned the murderers.

Chicanos

“We are a bronze people with a bronze culture. Before the world,
before all of North America, before all our brothers in the bronze
continent, we are a nation, we are a nation of free pueblos, we are
Aztlan.”

— El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan.

Since the brutal conquest of the Aztecs by the invading Spanish
armies, the Mestizo has been involved in the struggle for self-
determination. The Mestizo made up the armies of Guadalupe Hidalgo
y Costillo, the liberator of Mexico. The Mestizo made up the guerrillas
of Emiliano Zapata and of Pancho Villa and fought racist oppression
in the 1910 Revolution in Mexico. Yet that Revolution was not
enough, for he must now free himself from economic oppression.

Within the political boundaries of the United States, the mestizo is
oppressed both economically and racially. A direct manifestation of
both oppressions is the Vietnam War, a war propagated by the rich
capitalists who have grown richer since World Wars I & II.

Chicanos have made up 20% of the front line casualties in the
Vietnam War, while we are only 5% of the U.S. population. There is
definite oppression in this kill-ratio.

In the early stages of the anti-war Movement, it was dominated by
white youth. It was not until after the 1968 Chicano Youth
Conference in Denver that Chicanos were directly to confront the war
issue. From the summer of 1968 to the summer of 1969, Rosalio
Munoz, former UCLA student body president and now facing a prison
term for refusing the draft, organized the Chicano Moratorium
Committee to hold a Chicano Moratorium. Chicanos from across the
Southwest responded decisively.On August 29, 1970, Chicanos
showed up en masse to march in protest across East Los Angeles. At
the event, the beloved Ruben Salazar, a Chicano journalist for the Los
Angeles Times, was killed by a gas-cannister fired from a policeman’s
riot gun. Chicanos across the Southwest responded by taking direct
actions against the powers that oppress them in their local areas.
Demonstrations ensued in Houston, Denver, Crystal City, San Diego
and elsewhere.

11

Since then Chicanos have been active in the anti-war Movement.

At the coming Republican convention, Chicanos have the opportu-
nity to show their opposition to the War. Many will take the
opportunity to come. For those that will come here is some
information:

12

 

 

— There are about 200,000 Chicanos in San Diego County, about
20 percent of the population.

— San Diego has an official unemployment rate of 6 percent - 50
percent of them are Chicanos.

- La Raza Unida Party is active in San Diego.

— There is a MECHA central, with a chapter at most educational
facilities (San Diego State College, Palomar City College, San Diego
City College, Mesa College, Southwestern College and El Camino
College.)

— La Huelga is active in San Ysidro.

— There is a community federation composed of all active Chicano

organizations -- the Chicano Federation.

- There is a Chicano newspaper: La Verdad.

- Logan Heights is the central area of the Chicano community.

Chicanos wanting to work against the Republican convention may
get in touch with the Third World caucus within the San Diego
Convention Coalition, but are advised to get in touch with a Chicano
organization first. Con el corazon en la mano, Un carnal trabajando
con the San Diego Convention Coalition

Gay Liberation

The Gay Liberation Front of San Diego, our local extension of the
three year old Gay Liberation movement, has been active in resisting
the heterosexual oppression of our community. Gay sisters and
brothers are no longer willing to be defined by our sexist oppressors,
and we will furthermore resist any attempt by them to be treated
according to their arrogant perspectives. We are Gay and we are
beautiful people.

In keeping with this attitude, the National Gay Conference on
Election Strategy ‘72 has called for national Gay demonstrations at
the Republican National Convention this August to demand an end to
the sexist oppression by the Nixon administration and the sexist
attitude of the Republican Party. The conference, which was held in
Chicago, Illinois, on February 13th, 14th and 15th, and which was
attended by the representatives of Gay activist organizations all over
the United States, selected the Gay Liberation Front of San Diego to
plan and coordinate these National demonstrations.

It is the general will of the National Conference that these
demonstrations be separate and distinct from those planned by other
dissenting groups. However, we recognize the importance of maintain-
ing a channel of communication with the San Diego Convention
Coalition, and in making our plans in deference to their plans. We

heartily approve of the intelligent" and rational approach of the ..

Convention Coalition in preparing the way for peaceful and construc-
tive activities at the Republican Convention; and we will endeavor to
strengthen the bonds between the coalition and GLF.

‘G.I. Organizing, Peace Movement & Youth Movement

Although San Diego has not been known as a strong movement
town in the past, it cannot be regarded as a homogenous right-wing
stronghold. The peace movement was active here before the Vietnam
War with “Ban the Bomb” demonstrations. Civil rights actions also
began here in the early 1960s, at the same time they were happening
nationwide.

The anti-war movement grew steadily in the late 1960s, fueled by
the expanding war in Indochina. Mass demonstrations, once thought
impossible here because of the supposedly conservative climate, were
held in 1969 and 1970. The war also stimulated the growth of the
student movement on previously apolitical campuses, reaching a

14

 

 

ﬂood-tide of a.'.v1t,' during the Cambodia invasion of 1970.

In March, 1971,. several hundred white youth fought with police at
Collier Park in Ocean Beach after police tried to break up a rally
protesting the sale of the park to private developers. The youth
community in Ocean Beach has been the scene of several other
spontaneous riots against the police in recent years. Young and old
people joined together in 1970 in a successful effort to stop
bulldozers from destroying part of their community.

There are 3 active G.I. organizing groups in San Diego: The
Enlisted Persons Place, the Concerned Military, and the Concerned
Officers Movement. All are affiliated with the Coalition. Last year,
Non-Violent Action, also an active ally of SDCC, initiated the San
Diego Harbor Project to work with the crew of the aircraft carrier
U.S.S. Constellation, which was being prepared to return to duty off
Vietnam. Among the actions of the Project wasareferendum asking
the men of the ﬂeet and the citizens of San Diego whether they
thought the Constellation should sail or not. Of the more than 54,000
votes cast, 82.4% were against the Constellation sailing. When the ship
did sail anyway, there was tremendous community support for 9
sailors who refused to leave with it.

The Harbor Project has continued to function working with the
crew of the Kitty Hawk when it was in port and preparing for the
return of the Constellation, which will be in port in August.

The Women’s Movement

The Women’s Movement in San Diego is diverse and decentralized,
representing a variety of political perspectives and strategies, all
seeking to challenge the oppression of women as workers, sexual
objects, reproducers, and socializers of children.

The Movement began in late Spring of 1969 with the formation of
a “rap” or “consciousness raising” group of college and community
women loosely associated with the San Diego State College campus.
During the Spring of 1970 a great deal of energy was focused on the
5-month struggle of the Women’s Studies Committee (which grew out
of that first rap group) to establish the first autonomous Women’s
Studies Program in the nation at San Diego State.

The struggle to establish the program, however, was only the
beginning of a more protracted one to retain the Program’s autonomy
— to keep it in the hands of the Women’s Movement and free from
university and corporate foundation co—optation. This struggle resulted
in the Women’s Studies Program separating itself from a foundation
controlled proposal for a Center for Women’s Studies and Services

15

(for a detailed account see Ramparts, October, 1971) and led to the
formation of the San Diego Women’s Center in the Spring of 1971, by
a conference of 250 women representing every local women’s
liberation group as well as many non-affiliated women.

During the last 2 1/2 years the Women’s Movement here has

generated a variety of groups, projects, and actions, including
Goodbye To All That, a women’s newspaper, child care centers at
State and San Diego City College, bridal faire demonstrations,
women’s groups working on anti-war projects, local chapters of the
National Organization of Women (NOW) and the National Abortion
Coalition, a women’s theater group, karate classes, women’s liberation
organizations on several local junior college and university campuses,
and various small rap and study groups.

During the past year the San Diego Women’s Center has been a
focal point for a number of service, educational and political projects.
It currently offers an on-going series of programs, films and dinners
for women and has organized the Women’s Community School, which
meets regularly on Saturday mornings.

The Women’s Studies Program at State is now in its second year. It
is collectively run by a student dominated faculty-student-staff board
and offers a 10-course curriculum. As an active part of the Women’s
Movement rather than an isolated academic program, its classes are
open to community women who are not enrolled students. From
those classes a number of projects have been generated to help create
links between the Program and other sectors of society, including
active work with women in local prisons.

Nixon has said that “each mother’s responsibility to her children
still deﬁnes her central role,” and vetoed the child care bill for its
“family weakening implications.” Women have a great deal at stake in
opposing current trends in the U.S. as represented by Nixon, thus the
Southern California Chapter of NOW recently called for a demonstra-
tion at the western White House in San Clemente to oppose the veto.
The women’s group in SDCC, together with the autonomous women’s
movement in San Diego organized a caravan to join in this protest.

The Women’s Caucus of SDCC sees women’s liberation as a
revolutionary struggle, as an integral part of an anti-racist, anti -
imperialist analysis which must be put into practice and brought to
other people.

We are struggling within SDCC to break down the traditional “male
leadership” system of domination, competitiveness, individualism, and
power relationships. We are struggling to develop alternative relation-
ships and work styles based on collectivity and a sharing and caring
support of each other. It is essential to the viability and validity of the
Coalition for these struggles to be reflected in our strategy and
organizing priorities, our propaganda and the image we present to the
people we are working with.

Workers

Since the Wobblies were driven out of San Diego in 15212, this has
been one of the most repressive cities in the West towards the labor
movement. Workers in most hotels where the Republican delegates
will stay lack any union representation at all.

Nixon has become a personal enemy to many thousand aerospace
workers here and in the Los Angeles area. The first contracts voided
by Nixon’s Pay Board were in the aerospace industry.

The active collusion between Nixon and the aerospace bosses is
obvious to the workers. Leon Parma, vice-president of Teledyne Ryan,
one of the corporations immediately affected by the Pay Board’s
ruling, is the chairman of the host committee for the Convention.
Four thousand striking workers at Rohr Industries had to give up their
pay demands because of the Pay Board’s ruling — Rohr chairman Burt
Raynes is a high-ranking delegate to the Convention, and Rohr public
relations man Ron Fuller is on leave to be executive director of the
host committee. Rohr also has offered its computers for processing
mass arrests during the Convention.

Rohr machinists went out on strike for the first time in the
company’s history in November, 1971, because the company was
trying to cut labor costs by hiring low-paid trainees and setting up
non—union runaway shops in Watts and Mexico. The Nixon administra-

of militant solidarity and friendship.

Banning Garrett from the Pacific News Service is now

formation of the San Diego Convention Coalition is a

With your Coalition,the movement will,of course,be
larger and stronger.You have known how to base your
work on the people,first getting the consent and sup-
port from the people.You've paid adequate attention tov
the problem of good organization and discipline .

Dear friends, _
Due to the Nixon's war policy,the situation in our +
country and yours is still difficult and complex.Nixon
tries to carry out his Vietnamization plan by keeping
the Thieu clique in power,sujugating the Vietnamese ;
people,hence the US neo-colonialist war is prolonging

still have to double their efforts to check Nixon's

tion helped Rohr by subsidies to the Watts plant and tariff waivers for
the Mexican plants.

Starting in the third week of the bitter strike, the San Diego
Convention Coalition mobilized its members for mass picketing at
Rohr. In the course of the strike, 4 SDCC members were arrested
along with 25 strikers. Eventually, the 9-week strike was sabotaged by
the International. a .- e T Q ,

SDCC believes that there is .a strong basis for unity between. the
struggle of the anti-war movement and that of workers against7.»N,ix“on’s
wage controls and union-busting. The attacks on Indochina‘ and ‘on
wages are both" necessary for the survival of the U.S.;_imperialist

_U.S. trade balance, which has deterioratedidue to the-crisis‘ in "the
balance of payments and the collapse of the dollarinternationally.
‘Wage con.trol=—is necessary for the U.S. tocontinue tobear the heavy
expense of counterinsurgency in ’Indochina." Even some union bureau:
crats are awakening to these connections and becoming more and
more vigorous in their opposition to the war.

The anti-war sentiment of the rank-and-ﬁle has also forced
organized labor into stronger opposition to the war. Polls show that
the lower the social- class of Americans, the higher the percentage of
people who favor immediate withdrawal from Vietnam. This isn’t
surprising, since it is the sons, brothers and husbands of the workin
class who are on the front-‘line. . _ V .  . _ , -

Webelieve that, workers are ready to form alliances with the‘ radical
movement. We intend to seize the time.

‘Omissions

There are some_constituencies that we haven’t talked about. They
include the non-working white, the aged, and ‘Native Americans. We
are not unaware of their existence or casual about the oppression they
suffer at the hands of the existing system. The fa_ct that we are not yet
together enough to have ,_statements from them in time for this
pamphlet is a measure of work that must be done. '

WHAT’S HAPPENING?

Coalition plans for the Convention have two thrusts: 1) to
demonstrate our dissent against the existing system, and 2) to
demonstrate alternatives as a concrete indication of the kind of
society we are determined to create for ourselves.

All of us in the Coalition (and we cover a broad spectrum of radical
politics) are convinced that violence will prove counter-productive at
this time and place. The more disciplined and together we are , the
more likely it is that we will be able to get our message across straight,
without it either being used to their advantage by the Right or
co-opted by liberal Democrats. ’

SDCC has begun planning some projects to build towards August
and for the time of the Convention itself. At this point, we are also
keeping time open for specialized actions around targets of various
constituencies’ choosing. Other actions could range all the way from
continued massive marches to small constituency actions to civil
disobedience. «

Our plans to date include:

Demonstration

There should be at least one massive, legal, demonstration past the
Sports Arena. We would like to see people marching in contingents
with banners to identify their constituency or interest and to signify
the diversity of opposition to Nixon and present U.S. policy. It would
be good to have a few giant ﬂoats that present the major issues in
graphic form.

Expose ‘72

Demonstrating dissent is just one thing we want to do during the
Convention. We also want to create a setting in which people can learn
from each other about the specific nature of our country and the
world we live in, and the state of the movement.

We will create a humanized People’s World’s Fair, called Expose
‘72. This will be a large exposition about the victims of injustice and
their liberation struggles; the institutions, and ideas which perpetuate
this injustice, and some visionary but practical alternatives to the
oppressive system we live under.

Groups and individuals coming to San Diego are invited to send us
their ideas for Expose ‘72 between now and August, and to bring
ﬁlms, programs, exhibits, etc., with them. There should be exhibits by

19

 

Black, Chicano, Native American, Asian, poor, gay people, women
and youth in this country, as well as international exhibits on China,
Cuba, Vietnam, Palestine, Africa, and Latin America. We could have
workshops, films, and a video net that would link all the people
together. The art forms and architecture we use would be an
important part of our cultural experience.

We could use Expose ‘72 as a base from which to go into the
community. We can plant things, build things (playgrounds, recon-
structing condemned buildings, etc.), teach school, etc. People might
want to canvass door-to-door, inviting all San Diegans to Expose ‘72
and our other activities. ‘

The People’s Platform

The People’s Platform is the unifying political statement of the
demonstrations. It draws together the demands for action against
imperialism, racism, sexism, exploitation of labor, police and judicial
repression, and poverty. ’

The People’s Platform is seen as an organizing tool that can be used
throughout the country, particularly in states that hold primaries. A
nationwide People’s Platform campaign would raise basic issues rather
than merely focusing on candidates. Candidates could be confronted
with the platform and forced to take stands on it, hopefully at both
the Republican and Democratic Conventions.

If broadly based enough, the Platform could be used as a means of
uniting the efforts of the Left to relate to new constituencies and help
to bring about a considerable degree of unity with already committed
groups.

Finally, we see the Platform as a tool to help mobilize people
around the country and point the way to San Diego.

SDCC is moving ahead to gain support of national organizations
and coalitions for the idea of a People’s Platform. If the response is
favorable enough, we hope to bring together a national conference to
ratify it. t

The Petition

SDCC is circulating a petition in San Diego County opposing the
holding of the Republican Convention here. The petition attacks the
Republican’s policies of war and repression and points out that the
people of San Diego will be taxed to pay for the Convention even
though they had no say in bringing it here. The petition is both an
educational tool and a way to create a public climate for the
demonstrations that is as favorable as possible.

Logistics and Governance

Besides tactical planning SDCC is taking responsibility for the
logistics of August. This includes getting permits for marches and
unusual land use, making sure that water, food, and sanitary facilities
are available, child care is organized, and that legal and medical
assistance is mobilized.

While we can do the preparatory work in these areas, most of the
real work will have to be done by the people coming here. SDCC is not

‘ offering hotel services to the movement.

The most important demonstration during the Convention will
simply be ourselves. How we act in the encampments and during
actions will be the critical message conveyed. Contingents will have to
find’ ways to govern themselves, lead themselves, and provide for
themselves from the resources available. The sense of social responsibi-
lity we show towards ourselves maybe more important than our
speeches and written documents.

AND IN THE OTHER CORNER . . .

San‘ Diego ‘7 2 is not Chicago ‘.68. Local officials, hoping fora
boost in convention trade for San Diego, don’t want a repeat of the
1968 Democratic Convention demonstrations. Nixon wants a quiet
convention to show the world he has nailed the ‘coffin shut on dissent
in ‘America. While massive security arrangements are being developed,
the master plan seems to rely more on co-option than violent
repression.

Instead of discouraging white youth from coming to San Diego in
August, the city has taken a conciliatory line. It has announced its
willingness to “give” demonstrators Fiesta Island during the Conven-
tion. It has announced that demonstrations can take place along
Sports Arena Blvd., paralleling the Convention site. Chief of Police

Ray Hoobler has called the Convention the “greatest experience” of _

his life as a police officer and said he realizes certain laws may have to
be bent to accommodate a large inﬂux of demonstrators. Rumors of

22

 

 

 

rock concerts and festivals to be held concurrently with the
Convention are abundant and at least one promoter has approached
the city already with his plans for a festival 30 miles out of town.

City officials perhaps realize that a large number of youth involved
in a dope and music festival during the Convention will actually be
good press instead of having an adverse effect. The gut issues will be
clouded and smothered by the media portrayal of a scene that is fast
becoming a television re-run —- the love and peace Woodstock scene.

Despite the city’s slickness there seems to be a rift developing
between it and Washington. A recent article in the N. Y..Times quoted
a city official as saying the Republicans are unhappy with the way
things are being handled here. Nixon’s,camp wants there to be no
demonstrations at all. To apply .a bit of subtle pressure to the city, the
Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) sent" San Diego’s
request for funds back tothe city for revisions. The city has asked for
$920,000 from LEAA to pay overtime salaries, purchase riot control
equipment, and provide special training for local police. The city will
undoubtedly receive a large sum of money from LEAA; how much
may depend on the city’s decision on how to use it. V

In case the cooptation route fails, San Diego is making extensive
preparations for potential trouble. Security task forces have been
formed by the city and county. Between the two, a total of 1,800
uniformed police will be on duty on 12-hour shifts. Using the
state-wide mutual aid pla-in, police . can be brought in from 4
surrounding counties. Upon request, all available California Highway
Patrol officers will be sent to San Diego. Local National Guard Units
have already received Civil Disturbance training. Also involved in the
planning are the F.B.I., Secret Service, and Naval Intelligence.

The police are workingon plans for a computerized radio relay
system that will allow them to process mass arrests in a short time.
The police are also looking into Balboa and San Diego Stadiums as
mass detention sites, should that prove necessary. V

The county purchased three new helicopters with an LEAA grant.
These will be used as airborn observation platforms. While the police
can survey any demonstrations, demonstrators will be unable to
survey the cops if the $920,000 LEAA grant goes through. The city is
planning to use part of it to join with Miami in the purchase of a radio
system which operates on frequencies that citizens cannot monitor.

The fact that there is a split developing between the city and the
feds make it impossible to know for sure what the ﬁnal policy
towards demonstrators will be. It is obvious that they are trying to be
prepared to handle any violence that occurs. What they may not be
able to handle are demonstrations which are disciplined in conduct,
diverse in participation, uncompromising in content, and beyond their
power to either co-opt or intimidate.

GETTING IT TOGETHER

We feel that the San Diego Convention Coalition represents a
creative effort to arrive at a new model for relating local organizing
and national action. SDCC members have travelled around the
country in the past few months, talking with many different people.

‘We do not expect the August actions to be one-shot actions

detrimental to local organizing efforts. Rather, we think that our
overall program of local initiative combined with tools like the
People's Platform can aid people’s organizing efforts wherever they
are. In San Diego, the coming of the Convention has given us the
incentive to reach out to the entire city and to unify our movement.

We need people to move here to work with us for the period
between now and August —- and hopefully beyond. It would be ideal
if collectives could send one person now, to work with us and create
links with their home community, with the rest of the collective
following in August.

If you are interested in moving here now, get in touch with us.
Bring all your creative ideas, your innovative skills, as well as cars,
money, typewriters and other tools.

If you can’t come now, come in June. If you can’t come in June,
come in August. And if you can’t come at all, you can still help. Let
us know:

— Your comments on this pamphlet.

— Your name, if you want to be on our mailing list.

- If you will distribute literature and posters

(How many? 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 pieces?)

— If you can help us financially.

(25c, $1, $5, $25, $100, those old postage stamps you
have lying around?)

— If you can assume responsibility as a regional contact. This
means you will do educational and publicity work around the issues
outlined here and bring people to San Diego.

This is a crucial historical period. The job is great, but so are the
possibilities.

For Peace with Justice,
SDCC

AUGUST 21st — 24th, 1972 . . .

The establishment of the city of San Diego (but not its people) will
play host to the Republican National Convention. This present
“executive committee of the ruling class” will meet in the 61/2 million
dollar Sports Arena.

At the same time, people of San Diego, through the San Diego
Convention Coalition (SDCC), will play host to the people of the
United States. The people will gather in the streets and parks of the
Cl .

tyThis pamphlet is to tell you something about San Diego, the
Coalition, and what’s happening in August.

WHERE HAVE WE BEEN?

Thesis

At the end of W.W. II the United States, which had been spared the
ravages of war, was the most powerful nation in the world. This
position has become increasingly challenged over the past quarter
century by an overall shift in the alignment of world forces. The
industrial strength of Western Europe and Japan has put the U.S. on
the defensive commercially. The U.S. no longer has a monopoly on
nuclear power. Most importantly, increasingly successful liberation
movements have grown up in countries that have suffered greatly
from U.S. exploitation. Nevertheless, the rape of the resources and
people of other nations by the U.S. is far from ended. Six percent of
the world’s population still controls over 50% of the world’s
resources.

The ruling class, currently represented by Nixon, recognizes the
change in the world situation. The “Nixon Doctrine” is not simply
political sloganeering. It represents a major shift in tactics designed to
maintain U.S. domination of the rest of the world in the face of the
new forces working against it.

The heart of the Nixon Doctrine is reliance on a series of “junior
partners” who will help the U.S. police the globe. For example, Japan
is primarily a commercial junior partner. Japanese industries will
penetrate the markets of Asia better than U._S. industries can. But U.S.

corporations own heavy concentrations of stock in the Japanese
countries.

Other, less industrialized countries are military junior partners. The
U.S. learned a lesson in Vietnam and now it will use the highly
trained, superbly equipped armies of puppet countries like South
Korea and Iran to fight its counterinsurgency wars. That’s what
Vietnamization is all about.

In part, then, the Nixon Doctrine. represents a response to the
ability of the anti-war movement to arouse strong sentiment against
the U.S. being the policeman of the world. Nixon ‘hopes that by
cutting U.S. casualties almost to zero and relying on technology and
foreign troops he can undercut peace sentiment. But imperialism is a
system, and weakness at one point is matched by weaknesses
elsewhere. The U.S. is not only in an international crisis, it faces ‘a
series of domestic crises as well. The Nixon Doctrine is expensive
medicine, and to carry it out requires extending and tightening
controls over the lives of people at home. This is behind the
administration’s approach to welfare, the wage controls, and the
attack on the right to collective bargaining.

In the meantime, while crises take up the energy of the
government, basic problems in the society deepen and spread. The
basic fabric of the society remains racist, sexist, authoritarian,
oppressive to poor people, and generally unresponsive. The gap
between a wealthy few and the rest of the people continues to widen.
The urban and natural environment deteriorate from abuse.

Yet, instead of a reallocation of resources which would meet the
needs of the people, the unfurling banner of law and order is used to
justify repression of dissent. Basic civil liberties are eroded. A
quasi-national police force is being developed through federal training
and equipping of, and control over, local police forces. There is
increased illegal surveillance of those elements in the society that are
most actively resisting. There is a spread and increase in the use of
terror tactics in prisons, poor communities, and college campuses.

We must understand imperialism as a system with foreign and
domestic faces. The Nixon Doctrine represents a shift in tactics on the
part of the ruling elite designed to cope with changing realities of
power in the world. It is the first major shift in strategy since the
Truman Doctrine of 1947. The goals have not changed, however.
They remain the insurance of U.S. access to foreign resources and
markets, the maintenance of the U.S. position as the dominant world
power, and the suppression of liberation movements. The domestic
implications of this policy are increased deception, control and
repression.

We must understand that defeat of Nixon is not enough. We must
defeat this strategy as well.

Antithesis
Since the freedom rides and sit-ins of the 1950s, the liberation

movement in the  has walked a Pong and often painful road. We’ve
come from civil rights to Black Power, Brown Power, Red Power.

 

x..——» ——v —~ ~—~—\.— , A

 

 

Submission and secrecy have given way to Women’s Liberation and
Gay Liberation. Anti-war and liberal politics have grown to anti-
imperialism, anti-capitalism, and demands for workers’ control of
production and guaranteed annual income. Students and street people
learned to struggle for their own needs at places like Peoples’ Park and
Collier Park.

Step-by—step, each gain in awareness has been forced on us by the
refusal of the establishment to respond to even the most elementary
demands for justice. Almost against our will we learned that it’s
useless to petition those in power -— that we have to create People’s
Power.

But we’ve paid a price for our growth of awareness. As we became
more sophisticated we tended to isolate ourselves from our only
source of power — the people. Now we have a White radical
movement that speaks largely to itself, cut off from sisters and
brothers: who are Black, Brown and Red, from the workers in the
factories, stores and offices. V

SDCC sees the establishment of links among different segments of
the people as aprimary task in the period ahead. We see our work

around the Convention as an experiment in ways of doing that.

WHERE'S SAN DIEGO?

San Diego is ultra-America. On the one hand it can be seen as a
conservative, mid-westem small-town transplanted to Southern
California and grown too large. But San Diego is more than that.
There are wvo major counter-culture communities in SD (Ocean Beach
& Mission Beach), as well as active anti-establishment groups on the
university, college and junior college campuses. The black and very
large chicano communities both are pockets of resistance. There are a
range of alternative institutions including food co-ops, free clinics, and
good underground media. The ﬁne climate has also attracted large
numbers of nonpolitical but freaky people.

The main businesses of the area are military bases, military and
aerospace hardware, and tourism. The Navy Air Systems Command,
located here, deploys the attack carriers from which almost half the
bombing raids over Indochina originate. Two of these carriers, the
Constellation and Kitty Hawk, are home-ported here. V

The Naval Electronics Lab, also located in SD, is an important
research and development center for the “electronic battleﬁeld.” Data
is processed there for evaluation and determination of targets to be
destroyed in Indochina.

In addition, there are several military training centers here. The
Marine Corps Recruit Depot and the Naval Training Center train all
Marine and Navy -recruits from the Western half of the U.S. At the
Naval Amphibious base, an elite group called “the Seals” are trained
in demolition and assassination techniques used against the Indo-
chinese. At Miramar, just north of SD, pilots are trained for F4 and
F8 ﬁghter bombers, also used in Indochina. The Imperial Beach Naval
Air Station is the “helicopter capitol” of the Navy. The Marine Corps’
Camp Pendleton, about 50 miles north of SD and just south of
Nixon’s San Clemente home, is the largest training area in the nation.
At Camp San Mateo, men are given Civil Disturbance, or riot control,
training.

A few facts and ﬁgures:

— San Diego is 110 miles south of Los Angeles on I-5 and 16 miles
north of the Mexico-U.S. border.

— There are 700,000 residents in the city and 1,358,000 in the
county.

—— There are about 100,000 servicemen in the county at any one
time, with the ﬁgure ﬂuctuating as ships arrive and depart.

— San Diego voted for Nixon 61% to 39% in 1968.

With its conservative political climate for support and the Marine
Corps for security, San Diego looks like the perfect place for the
Republicans to gather to re-nominate Nixon. But there’s a growing

for.

THE MILLION DOLLAR CIRCUS
How It Ended Up In San Diego

News that the Republican Convention was coming to San Diego
was met with objections from most of the people of the city and even
some officials (the most vocal of whom are out of office now). By far
the strongest objections were about the cost of hosting such an event.
The city had to come up with an initial bidof 1.5 million dollars, and
estimates for the total cost are running between 2.5 and 4 million
dollars. Despite assurances by pro-convention Republicans that no
city money would be spent, San Diegans realized that it would be the
people who eventually pay.

The same motive, money, is what’s bringing the convention to San
Diego. Sheraton Inns, a subsidiary of I.T. & T., came up with
$400,000 to round out the initial bid. Sheraton owns two hotels in
San Diego and is building a third. I.T. & T. has gained valuable
tidelands to build cable factories in San Diego through the local Port
Commission, which is supposedly controlled by C. Arnholt Smith.
Smith was Nixon’s largest campaign contributor in 1968. The clincher
is Harold Geneen, I.T. & T.’s President, who was co—fund raising
chairman with Smith in 1968.

There’s more. Eight days after the announcement that San Diego
would be the site of the Convention, the Justice Department dropped
an anti-trust suit against I.T. & T. The out-of-court settlement allowed

'I.T. & T. to acquire the 1 billion dollar Hartford Insurance Company.

C. Amholt Smith got the prestige of hosting Nixon and his convention
(as well as substantial income through his local businesses), the
Republicans got 1.5 million dollars, and the people of San Diego will
eventually pick up the bills.

Because of this there is a better chance than ever before that many
of the local citizens will become involved in, or be sympathetic with,
demonstrations.

What's At Stake?

The Coalition isn’t planning demonstrations at the Republication
Convention just so we can have a liberal Democrat for president. (We

know enough history to know that it was Kennedy who first sent .

large numbers of U.S. ground troops to Indochina.) We’re moving
against Nixon and the Republicans because they are the present
guardians of the interests of the American establishment. They are the
most visible, tangible proponents of U.S. imperialism, sexism and

6

 

racism, and of the repression that underlies all that.

Demonstrations in San Diego are a crucial part of the range of
activities‘ the movement should undertake at this time. If we don’t act
in San Diego we will give Nixon a free rein in his escalation of the war
and increasingly repressive domestic policies. Through massive demon-
strations here we can shatter the illusion of domestic paciﬁcation that
is so essential to Nixon’s program.

Demonstrations in San Diego, a major military center, also give us a

unique opportunity to develop the resistance movement within the

armed forces. Organizing for massive demonstrations can help turn the
militaryapparatus into a Trojan horse by consolidating wide-spread
internal dissatisfaction and accelerating instability within the military.

The present crises ‘in the U.S. are opening up many people to
alternatives -from‘ the Left, and the San Diego activities can give many
of them a first chance to express their dissatisfaction publicly.
Massive, nonviolent demonstrations with diverse constituency repre-
sentation will have important effects, both directly on the partici-
pants, giving them a new sense of strength and unity, and indirectly
on the millions who will watch on TV. If people from all over the U.S.
pour into San Diego to join local people in massive, nonviolent
protest, using creative tactics that shows our seriousness, we will
provide an instructive contrast to the Republican rubber-stamp
renomination of Richard Nixon.
