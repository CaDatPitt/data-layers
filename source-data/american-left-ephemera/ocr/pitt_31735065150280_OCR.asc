_ llegislative work, carried
er‘ in momentum from the
 on’s effective political ac-
tion last November, contributed
importantly here toward
drarinartic defeat Feb. 17 of a
“right. to work” proposition in
the New Mexico legislature.

' "Theﬁstate senate voted 17 to
1/5 or kill the Theasure, revers-
ing its previous action of four
days, before when the proposal
Wasapproved as the result of

 

I

  

a tie-breaking vote cast by the
lieutenant governor.

On Feb. 13 the senate had
passed a joint resolution to
submit the compulsory open
shop constitutional amendment
to referendum. Lt .Gov. Ed V.
Mead cast the deciding vote
when the upper chamber split
evenly with all of the state’s
32 senators voting on the
resolution. Twelve Democrats
and four Republicans voted
for and twelve Democrats and
four Republicans voted against.

Democratic party opponents
of the measure immediately
challenged the validity of the
vote on the technical point
that the lieutenant governor's
action was improper. Attorney
General Frank B. Zinn then
ruled that the earlier passage
of the resolution was invalid
because of a. technicality sur-
rounding Mead’s tie-breaking
vote. With Mead’s ballot voided,
the original senate vote re-
verted to a‘ 16-16 tie on the
measure, in effect killing it.

Following a flurry of parlia-

resolution was again intro-
duced on Feb. 17. This time
Sen; VVilliam Osborne (D.) of

inally voted in favor of the
“right to work” proposal,

against it and the measure

SAN FRANCISCO—
With the first bang of the
chairman’s gavel at 10 am.
on Monday, March 16, the

Crystal room of the Belle- 2

vue hotel here will be the
scene of intense activity and
serious work. For six days
thereafter, the delegates to the
54th Convention of the Inter-
national Union of Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers will
hear, speak, write, and read
untold thousands of words.

‘And each word will have to

do with just one subject: how

to provide a better life for

Mine-Mill members and their
families. ‘

The results of all the talk,
the reports, and the resolu-
tions may not sound impres-
sive when it is stated simply
that the delegates will meet
in San Francisco primarily to
agree on a collective bargain-
ing program. But, in addition,
they will act on constitutional
amendments, a legislative pro-

gram, organizational obj ec-A
tives, financial outlook, legal.

defense, union administration,
and conceivably even what
they think about the space
age, war and peace, integra-
tion, taxation, and relaxation.
They’ll nominate candidates

This year he continues to
serve on the loca1’s executive

board, representing the Junc- I

PD mine membership.

THIRD TERM

This is Dalton’s third 2-year
term as a Democrat in the
Arizona House. A humorous
story goes with his first term
election. He beat his opponent
by one vote, earning from his
Mine-Mill supporters the title
of “Landslide Dalton." A re-
count demanded by his oppo-
nent gave Dalton a slightly wid-

er margin of victory, but the

title stuck anyway. He was
re-elected to a second term
much more handily, and had
no opposition for his present
third term.

A respected and influential
legislator, Dalton’s service has
been marked by serious study
of every bill." He is noted for
maintaining close’ contact with
his constituents, including
members of the local, and fre-

* quently contacts people from

Dalton’s name is strongly

which is designed to improve
silicosis benefits, shorten time
of exposure to qualify and
lengthen period following last
exposure for filing. The bill
would also give benefits for
the first time for partial disa-
bility due to silicosis.

Although the bill passed the
House in the previous legis-
lature, it never got out of com-
mittee in the Senate. The
measure is believed to have a
better chance of passage dur-

Ansonia

American Brass company in

Ansonia and Torrington, Conn., Q
has begun sending’ out “Dear

John” letters in a transparent
effort to soften -up its work-

ers‘ for coming Mine-Mill ne-

gotiations at the plants. In re-
ply to a company letter of Feb.
9, Ansonia Local 445 issued its
own open letter» to the plant
manager on Feb. 13 -in which
appreciation was expressed by
the union on the company's in-
terest in their workers’ welfare
and also outlining some con-
tract suggestions by which the.
Anaconda subsidiary c o u l d
make its workers more content
than they are right now.

Among the suggestions to
the company were more ade-
quate provisions in the pres-
ent medical and hospitalization
insurance program to eliminate
loopholes costly to the work-
ers, plus the same coverage for
pensioners. Another suggestion
was a. supplementary employ-
ment benefit plan for protec-
tion of the workers a g a i n s t
shorter work weeks and short-
er pay checks. Local 445's open
letter also invited management

to comment “on how to im-

prove our medical and hospital

insurance program and how to.

eliminate the hardships of the
short work week” the next
time ABC sends out another
“Dear John.”

NEARLY $3000 IN BACK PAY,was received recently byithree members

   
 

   

of Mine-Mill local 509‘ following the union's arbitration victory which
won their reinstatement at the AS&R smelter in El"Paso, Texas. While
the decision of Arbitrator John E. Gorsuch‘ directly ‘concerned only
Aniceto ,,Briones,'laid-off out of seniority on the company's claim that
it could keep more .“qualified" workers on the iob in a plant-wide
reduction of force, two other workers (Jose Diaz and Romero Bonillas)

’ laid ‘off on the same basis as Brionesweref also reinstated with back

pay when management decided not to go to arbitration on their case
as a result of the Briones decision. ln—I'l Rep. M. R. Barraza and-Busi-

mine work week to four days
from last May 8 to Oct. 26.
The grievance arose June 4
when the union became aware
of a company order that, all
vacations were to be pro-rated
downward due to the reduced
week. Arbitration followed re-
fusal of the union to accept 3
formula which the company

proposed-to use for pro-rate of V

vacation purposes. .

Management based its case
on the contention that because

the contract referred to a;pro- .

rate in the event of a six-day

.week, that this also indicated

an understanding and right to
pro-rate in the event of a four-

F day week or less. ‘
The union argued that the-

contract clearly indicates that
vacation allowances . as s et

forth in its agreed chart would 1

always be granted as a mini-
mum if the employee had met
the necessary shift require-
ments, except only that an ad-
ditional benefit would accrue
whenever he worked a part or
allof his ‘qualifying year on _a
six day work week basis. The

company’s new pro-rate for-«

mula, the union contended, was
nothing less than an attempt
to amend the contract without
collective bargaining.

The arbitrator decided there.
was no provision in the con-
tract “for decreasing pro rate
the agreed vacation period

-when the company voluntarily

reduced the work week,” and
ruled: “Employees whose

earned vacations were pro»

rated to a. 4-day week and who
were refused the regular es-
tablished vacation computed on
a 5-day week, are entitled to

be g r a n t e d proportionately R

either additional days or frac-
tion thereof of paid. vacation
or, alternatively, pay in lieu
thereof at regular hourly rate
covering any proportionate de-
crease in allowed v a c a t i o n s
pro-rated to a 4-day week.”

Tacoma

AS&R management at the
Tacoma, Wash., smelter has
been told that the‘ Local 25
membership is fed up with the
company's
abuses’ of work provisions on

the job.
A major grievance in the.Ar- »

senic plant over management’s
assignment of a number of du-
ties to one man which in the

past have been performed by

two or more men was a straw
that broke the camel's back,
resulting in.a spontaneous
work stoppage ‘and demonstra

tion of two hours by 367 work-‘ .

crs. on. Feb.,_3 after an’ attempt

‘to settle, the grievance with

.. V

unreasonable;

the foreman had failed tob_ring
desired results.‘ The company
responded by issuing ‘warning
slipswhich the union says was
aimed at all the men. , ,
Following a top‘ grievance
meeting on Feb. 4, plant mana-
ger R, E. Shinkoskey advised

Business Agent Elmer Olsen '-

and Local '25 that the union's
grievance‘ was denied. In an-
swer, an open letter from
Olsen to the manager declared:
“The membership of this union
have instructed me to inform
you they reject your "letter of
Feb. 6 relating to the Arsenic
Department grievance and also
recall of all warnings issued
the 367 members who ‘attended
the stop work grievance meet-
ing Feb. 3. If no settlement

. can -be reached this union will

continue to. fight and struggle
with everything at its com-
mand on these and other griev-
ances.” -

Butte

, President Ernest Sjoman of ’
Butte. Miners Union No. 1, in

the leading article of the Feb.
7 issue of the Mine-Mill Butte
Miner, blasts the‘ propaganda
which says the recession is
over, the economy has revived,
all’s well in the world of pro-
duction and profits, and that
all we need now is “more rock
in the box” as the cure-all for
our economic ills.

“More rock in the box with
less cos ,” writes Sjoman,
“may have been a good remedy
to help the economy of a pre-

historic settlement 200 years

ago, but not during this age
of automation and great tech-
nological progress in produc-
tion. , »
“Today the only remedy is
a shorter working day and
more of the share of the wealth
we produce. That and that
alone is the only logical and

‘ scientific solution to the con-

tinued menace of f unemploy-
ment.”

' ‘John "Clark telegraphed Presi-
’ e_n_t Eisenhower to scathingly
efine the ‘speech as “a brazen
tv“itation~to anti-labor employ-
as to maintain their r e c 0 r d
 profits at the expense of their
‘ working forces.”

.. A The Eisen_hower administra-
’-tion of v late has been making
Tvague references to “inflation-

. -‘a1'y.'wage spirals.” On behalf

. ‘bf 1“many thousands of work-

i, , ers -desperately ‘in -need- of in-
A ereasjea. income,” Clark re-
 :;'ques'ted the President “to make
 to the people of the
Ilriitedi States whether the
C — i(:Str'a.uss) Chicago speech ac-
‘-‘ cm-ately reflects yo11r ‘ own

-views and if his appeal to em-
ployers to resist so-called un-

 warranted wage increases is

"an -official declaration of ‘War
against the nation’s wage
“earners.” ,

 If it is not, Clark told the

‘,Pr_esident, “an immediate state-

, ment from you is necessary to
E  allay the fears of working men
and women that they are fac-
ing -a government - sponsored
‘period «of labor strife and- un-
. ‘ bridledprofiteering while their
" own’ wages are frozen at levels
1 , inadequate to meet the oppres-
 sive cost of living or to main-

tain the decent standards of

, .Which our nation is so justly

 proud.” Clark declared in his
telegram that Strauss’ “intem-

~ pe rate statements certainly

- cannot be regarded as condu-

. , cive to peaceful labor-manage
ment relations.” - -  1

VVCITES INDEX A. T 
v The. Mine-Mill leader called
the President’s attention to

 Federal Reserve board figures
' showing that industrial produc-

 

Within

tion in January was about 6
per cent higher than a year

ago, “while unemployment, .

highest recorded in any Janu-
ary since 1941, was nearly one-

quarter million higher than in ,

January 1957.” In the light of
these figures, ‘President Clark
said, “Secretary Strauss’ ap-

— peal to employers to hold down

their labor costs is hypocriti-
cal. ' In short,” the union of-
ficer told the President, “Ad-

miral Strauss should be in-,

formed, if indeed he does not
know, that labor costs have
gone down and are continuing
to do so. Directly responsible
for lower labor costs is the
fabulous increase in manhour
productivity brought about by
layoffs, speedup and other de-
vices.”

Obviously angered by
Strauss’ attempts to lay the
blame for inflation at labor’s
feet, President Clark reminded
P r e s i d e n t Eisenhower that
“conspicuously absent from the
Admiral’s speech was any ap-
prehension over the real causes
of inflation in this country,

namely profiteering, monopo-'

listic price fixing, market rig-

‘ging, and other devices used to

gouge the public.” Such omis-
sions, the telegram stated, “are
particularly notable -in a year
in which the U.S. Treasury
says corporation profits will
reach the highest, level on rec-
ord. .I have searched through
all of the news dispatches and
fail. to find any -appeal by the
Admiral to put a lid on profits.

Nor do I find any concern over ‘
the nearly five million unem-

ployed.-”

WHAT HE MEANT ’ _
As to Secretary Strauss’ use

of the word “unwarranted” in

describing wage in c r e a s e s ,

lark Blasts Strauss Plea
o ‘Resist’ Pay Increases

 i  DENVER—Secretary of Commerce Lewis L. Strauss
"last month called uponthe nation's employers. to resist
-demands for “unwarranted” wage increases.
7-hours after the admiral-cabinet member addressed a
"group of top level corporation executives at a dinner of

 

"manner or COMMERCE LEWIS L snmuss (left) called for resistance -

by employers to wage increases in a speech before the Chicago Asso-
ciufion of Commerce and Industry last month. Strauss is shown here
at the dinner talking with Paul Goodrich (stun-ding), president of the
Chicago. Title and Trust’ company, and Joseph 1. Block, president of

inland Steel. Mine-Mill President John Clnrkblusfed The speech.

Clark said, that what the cabi-
net member meant “is easily
guessed when one reads the
headlines over the accounts of
his Chicago speech. Here in
Denver they read: ‘S t r a u s s
Urges Lid on Wages.’ ’’

Concluding his t e I e g ra in,
Clark said: “As I say, Mr.
President, I feel t h a t s o m e
statement by you is necessary
if the administration is to es-
cape responsibility for the ir-
responsible speechmaking of a
cabinet member.”

The right thing to do is to
forgive and forget, but most

.p:eople,can’t do two things at

once.

Some people vote as they

pray—never do either unless
they are asking for a personal
favor. ' ‘

Operafion Madness

BATON ROUGE, La.——Seg-»

regation leaders in Louisiana
were busy last month trying
to eliminate more than 100,000
Negroes from the vote-regis-
tration rolls, in defiance -of
possible inter.vention by the
federal government. Legisla-
tive, executive and judicial
branches of the state govern-
ment have been enlisted in
seeking rigid enforement of
voter-registration laws already
making it difficult f'o'r_—non-
whites to qualify.

State Sen. W. M. Rainach,
segregation. leader. admitted
that some white Voters would
also be chopped-off the rolls

“ in the process,’ but said many

more Negroes attempting to
register would be eliminated
for each white person affected.

It’s Spring   _ .

[Bargaining] A  A
Time Agfainl   

WASHINGTON, D. C.-
Just as in the middle of‘
Mine-Mill’s 1955 industry-
wide strike when “commu- _
nist” charges were leveled
against the union before the
Subversive Activities Control
board, so now as Mine-Mill prev
pares for major bargaining,
the SACB proceedings have.
once again been resumed
against the union after remain-
ing dormant for more than a
year and a half.

Hearings on the case -were 
suspended indefinitely in July
of 1957 following the famous
“Jencks decision” of the U. S.
Supreme court. Last month
the government suddenly
moved to reopen proceedings.

On Feb. 19 Mine-Mill Gen- .
eral Counsel Nathan_Witt ar-
gued -motions he had previous-
ly submitted on the applica-
tion of’ the “Jencks law”. in
connection with-FBI reports of
sixteen government witnesses
who -have already testified in
the case. Witt’s motionsasked
that the FBI reports of the six},
teen witnesses be produced for
comparison with their testi-
mony on the stand. ,

The hearing‘ examiner, form; .
er Gov. Francis Cherry of Ar
kansas, has taken the motion-
under advisement and is ex-
pected7to_ rule on them in the

’ near -_ future. . . ~ ,

WASHINGTON, D. C.———
February is the month of Abra-
ham Lincoln's birthday. Con-
gress, took time out from its
early session duties to pay
tribute tohim. It provided a

-good opportunity to take a

look at all the legislation which
is now in the “hopper” on Cap-
itol Hill on civil rights.

To date there must be close
to 50 civil rights bins of one
kind or another, I
into both houses of Congress.
However most of these bills
fall into _three or four’ major
categories.

First of all," there are the
Administration proposals. Sen-
ator Everett M. Dirksen (R.,‘
Ill.), now the minority leader,
introduced these bills. Also,
one bill was introduced on be-
half of the Administration by
Senator ~Barry. Goldwater (R.,
Ike’s proposal would
make it a Federal crime with
2 years  prison anda $10,000
fine to interfere with a Federal
court order on desegregation.
Also, another bill, with five

,years imprisomnent and a

$5,000 fine, would make it a

crime to attempt to evade tes-1

tifying in Federal cases on
school or church bombing in-
cidents by leaving the court’s
jurisdiction. Again with stiff
criminal penalties ‘is a‘ bill
which would require county
and state election officials to
preserve for three years all
voting lists, records and regis-
tration in ‘Federal. elections.
The bill also would give the

-Attorney -General - the right to

inspect such records _at any
time. '- - t * - -

‘ As in bills submitted both
by Democratic Leader Lyndon
Johnson ‘of Texas, and north-
ern Democrats, the President,
through Senator Dirksen, asks
that the'life of the Civil Rights
commission jgke extended. The
President‘ would ask that the
commission go until September
of 1961 with a partial report
in September of this_year.

Other administration bills

ty under government -' made

' takes place and, finally, in the

event that schools were closed

. children of the-members of the

ed withspecial tuition services.
. Reaction» to the President’s
proposals were varied. - Natur-

part‘ of it. while Northern lib-

erals feel that the Adrninistera-. —

tion proposals s_'till- do not carry

istering and voting. ,

Leader Johnson. The bill itself
was somewhat of a surprise
since no one expected the ma-
jority leader to take a lead on
civil rights legislation. But, the

~ bill introduced by Johnson has

not met with much enthusi-
asm among liberals, labor or

‘Negro organizations. Brieﬂy, it

is a bill which proposes a ‘form
of Federal conciliation along
the lines of the Federal media-
tion service as it applies to
labor disputes. Senator.John-
son’s theory is that in each 10-
cal community more could be
gained by conciliation .among
divergent groups on the issue
of school and other forms of
discrimination than by direct
Federal action. '
_In addition, the Senator’s‘
bill would prevent ‘ ‘ interstate
transportation of explosives or
attempts to threaten people by

0 their use. The Senator’s - bill

would also grant subpoena
powers to the Justice Depart.-
ment investigating cases of
violation of voting rights, and
also would extend the life of
the present Civil Rights com-
mission an additional year and
a half to January 2, 1961.
KEY BILLS I

But the bill or group of bills
around which most Negro, la-
bor and liberal organizations

probably will rally is a series’

of bills introduced into Con-
gress—in the Senate by Sena-
tor Paul Douglas (D., Il1.), and
Senator Jacob J. Javits (R.,
N. Y.), and in the House by

Judiciary Chairman Emanuel

Celler. (D., N. Y.). The bill by
Rep. Celler is HR3147. The
main bill in the Senate (S810)
by Senator Douglas and co-
sponsored by 16 other Senators,
is similar to the Celler bill and
has, briefly, the following main

— provisions:

The Secretary of ‘Health,
Education and Welfare would

be given the main responsibil- .

ity on the school integration
program. He would advise lo-
calities on procedure, make

grants to states of up to $40,-
000,000 a year to meet added

costs of integration and, in -the
event local school boards did
not act, the Health, Education
and Welfare Secretary would
have theauthority to prepare

...plans and have them enforced

by calling. upon, the Attorney
General, to file civil suits
against local, school boards.
Also, the Douglas-Celler bills

would give the Attorney Gen-

eral new and broad powers to

-seek injunctions’ in a large

area \of varied civil rights vio-‘
lations. This is “Part III”
which caused such lengthy de-
bate and was deleted from the
1957 Act as a compromise.
Hearings on the civil rights’
bills will be held -before a Sub-

- committee of.‘ the-» Judiciary
Committees of both houses. In" ‘

the Senate, Senator Tom Hen-

nings (D) of Missouri is Chair-. '
man of the Constitut-io‘hal'

ACK when the Civil war had ended and the
. job of lifting the Negro from slavery to
citizenship had begun, a Negro union organizer,
James T. Rapier, stood up in the Alabamaecone
stitutional convention to declare" 3

“Mr. Speaker, we must 
have a provision-in our new
constitution which grants
all, Negro .and white, the
right. to vote.”

That right was won then,
even though it was later
lost when the ex-slave own-
ers joined hands with north-
ern bankers and the Ku
Klux Klan and broke the
glorious Negro-white unity

Had the Reconstruction period of the 1870’s‘y}_‘
not been cut off by violence, the history of our  .5
country would have been very much different; '

chise. My colleagues and I in the South al- _. -
ways have known that the fight is not an easy :1
one. Almost any Negro in the South has been  _
forced to decide that if he fights for hisrights 
he may risk even death. You live and work» 1 -
from day to day for the things you believe.in,.. 
the rights you must have. And sometimes vi-  ’
olence enters the picture. Sometimes the other 
side tries to hold back the clock of history‘ in 
a most desperate way. Sometimes they feel « _

they must resort to jungle law.

HAT is what has happened in many places ; p
in the South. Suddenly, the racists have '
discovered that the law of the land is no longer ,
on their side. The courts have enlisted on the ,-
side of law and order, simple justice, Consti- .
tutional rights. L ’ "

I regard the recent physical attack on -me
and my son in Bessemer’s city hall as an act
of sheer frustration. I am convinced that the
mob which” beat and kicked me and ‘screamed
insults. had become aware that their system of _i ‘

Lost: 3.4 Billion Days

The U. S. Public Health Service reports that Americans lost

a total of about 3.4 billion days from their normal activities

because of illness or injury in the year ending June 30.
The average was 20 days per person. The total includes

‘both full days lost from work, school or other regular activi- t

ties, and days when norm_al.occupations had to be curtailed be-

cause of .a physical condition-.

The most serious offender was chronic ailments, with circu-

"latory diseases alone causing 484.2 million days of restricted

activity, or an average of 2.9 per person.

Those Docfor Bills!

No class of items making
up the cost-of-living index has

shot up more in recent years

than medical care. In January

. 1959, it cost 47.6 per cent more
to care for sickness than in ,-

years 1947-49. In the last year

alone, doctors’, dentists’, fees,
V drugs and hospital costs went.

up over 4 per cent.

The government's l_ate_st “Ere...
port on unemployment showed

rose from the preceding De-
cember by 600,000 to a totalgof
4.7 million. Because» of "ex-
haustions of unemployment ‘
benefits, fewer persons were .
drawing state» unemployment

than in the corresponding
month in 1957. The _make_sl1if_t

' temporary unemployzrnenticom-V

the total drawing temporary ,

ing: '
“You will appreciate that it

that in all instances contract

the above percentages. We can
assure you, however, that the

works out as expected, it will
mark the beginning of the end
of contract bonus systems” un-

der which miners are driven at 5
_ a pace which “burns them out”

long before their time. It will
establish contract p'f.es, to-

gether with a normal contract ‘

output and effort,‘ which will
guarantee adequate contract

earnings over and above day's ,

pay without the killing , pace
that thousands of miners know
from experience all too well.

 LEAD price has been ‘cut’ three times this year, most
“recently to 11 cents, down from 13 cents in October to mid-
‘January. Low consumption, rising producer stocks of refined
metal are behind the slump. Following the most recent cut,
‘St. Joseph Lead, big Southeastern Missouri producer cut its

   

'_ mining and milling operations from five days to four per week .

effective February 16. Lead import quotas obviously haven’t
‘had time yet" to make much of a dent on overstocks. Quotas
,will cut imports this year about 200,000 tons below 1958. U. S.
mine production of lead last year was lowest since 1899.

COPPER is up again. Producers moved to‘ 30 cents last

month, custom smelters to 31 cents. Strong European de-
rmand has been drawing more refined copper from U. S. than it

STRIKE at Anaconda’s Potrerillos copper mine in Chile was
averted early in February by agreement providing for 30 per

cent pay hike. Two thousand four hundred forty production-

workers -and 700 office employees were affected. Contracts
expire later in year at Kennecott’s Braden mine and Anaconda’s
Chuquicamata mine. Cerro de Pasco, big Peruvian lead-zinc
copper producer is on strike as we go to press.

CAPTIVE_ MARKETS, STABILITY BEHIND WIRE, CA-
BLE MERGERS. So reads the headline on a recent story in
the American Metal Market. Commenting on Kennecott’s recent
acquisition of Okonite, a major wire and cable maker, Alcoa's
takeover of Rome ‘Cable and two smaller non-ferrous mergers,
the article asks, “What’s behind the wire and cable acquisi-
tions?” Pointing out that such mergers are nothing new, the
article says Anaconda and Phelps Dodge captive. mills consume
about all the domestic copper output of the .parent companies.
In comparison, Kennecott has been the largest seller of copper
to outside companies, in addition to what its subsidiaries, Chase
Brass and Kennecott Wire & Cable take. “The desire to . . .
dispose of more of its copper by broadening captive operations
. . . appears to have been at least one of the factors behind the
Kennecott purchase of Okonite,” the article continues. Another
recent takeover——“verticle integration” is what the professors
call it——was Howe Sound's purchase of all of the stock of
Stamford Rolling Mills, a Connecticut producer of copper and
brass sheets. i »

AMERICAN SMELTING AND REFINING COMPANY was

in the financial news again recently. First it was announced
that the U. S. Government Export-Import Bank had loaned $15

million, in addition to previous loans totaling $100 million, to.

Southern Peru Copper Corporation, 57% per cent owned by
American Smelting and Refining. Now comes news that AS&R
has sold its minority interest in Cerro de Pa-sco Corporation on
‘the. New York Stock Exchange for about $10 million. Having
met its capital needs for ‘Southern Peru Copper Corporation
with a loan from big-hearted Uncle Sam, AS&R says it willuse

 the $10 million from sale of its Cerro de Pasco stock ‘for in-

vestment in new projects.——ARTHUR W. STUART. 1 k , 1

and severely injured while city
police looked on without inter-
fering. Asbury Jr., a Korean
war veteran, was arrested be-
cause he helped defend his
father. See (February issue,
Mine-Mill Union.)

On Feb. 23, Vice-President
.Howard’s appeal came up be-"
fore Judge Goodwin in Besse- ‘

mer. The judge ruled that the
appeal was defective and or-
dered the Negro leader to im-
mediately begin serving his
sentence, despite pleas from
Hood-that an appeal would be
filed immediately and that bail
was ready. _
FOR NEGROES ONLY V
Then began a series of ac-

- tions as friends, lawyers, and

the union tried to get Howard
freed on bail. Also sentenced
was the white sign painter,
named McAllister. Being white,
he was kept in‘ jail and not on
the work gang, a form of pun-
ishment reserved for N e g r o
prisoners in Bessemer.

Prior to his appeal appear-
ance on Feb. 23, Vice-President
Howard had been in New York
where the American Civil Lib-
erties union arranged a press

, conference for him. S i m i 1 a 1-
, press conferences were held in
_Chicago. Pledges of support
from all over the country were
being r e c ei v e d . The Negro
press‘ was headlining the story
on their front pages from

tended several protest meet-
ings _ln New York, Connecti.

‘A On Feb. 20, the ACLU called
' upon the Department of Jus-

tice to investigate the beat-

. ing of Howard and his son and
to “take all steps necessary to -

see that the off_enders are
properly and promptly dealt
with.”

-L-IBERTIES VIOLATED

* At a New York press con-
ference, Patrick Murphy Ma.
line, ACLU executive director,
made public -a letter to Attor-

ney General William Rogers.

in which he informed the cabi-
net member that the ACLU is
supporting the Howard case
because of the “serious inva-
sion of civil liberties.” ,
Malin wrote Rogers that “the
beating of an‘ American citi-
zen by a mob in the presence

. of local police is not only of

importance to the citizen un.
der attack, but to all Ameri-
cans who believe in the sanc-
tity of the law and fair treat-
ment by law-enforcement of-
ficials. Whenever necessary,
the federal government should
act to safeguard this principle.”
The ACLU official said that
at least a “de facto” conspir-
acy had occurred when,-in vio-
lation of the Federal civil
rights law, the police officers
stood by “as two citizens were
assaulted in the city hall while

thereunder compulsory proc-

Copper Companies’ Profits
Continue During Big Layoff

DENVER —- Two glaring
facts are spotlighted by recent
big copper company profit re-
ports. ._

1. Copper companies kept
right‘ on piling up profits
during the layoffs and shor

. weeks last year. ’

- 2. They‘ are now heading ‘
into what might well be one

_ of the most profitable years
in the copper industry's his-
tory.

These are the plain facts
sifted out by the Mine-Mill Re- _
search department from the
latest available business and
government sources, and pub-
lished in the department’s Feb-
ruary Mine-Mill Research Re-
port. 0

“It’s a lead-pipe cinch,” the
Report states flatly, that cop-
per profits, already back :to
above 1957 levels and equal to
the average for 1950-54, will
continue shooting up in 1959
toward the bonanza highs of
‘1955, when the copper price
averaged better than 37 cents
a pound,-and 1956 when it was
over 42 cents for the year.

CHART

Printed in the Research Re-
port is a_ chart analysis of cop-
per company profits from 1950
through 1958 (see chart at-
right) which shows a clear pat-
tern of relatively stable profits
through 1954, boomtime com»
pany earnings in 1955 and 1956,
a downturn through 1957 and
the first half __of 1958, followed
by a sharp upswing especially’
in the ve ry profitable la st
three months of last year.

The Research department
lists these main factors guaran-
teeing the continued upward
‘climb of copper profits this
year: high fourth quarter earn-
ings in 1958 were based on
lower average prices and low-
er mine production rates than
those in effect since the start
of 1959; recently established
copper prices are firm at 30
cents and will probably go
higher; and most important,
the copper companies are now
geared up as never before for
low-cost, high profit produc-

back last year, especially during the last three months, October through
December. Profits are'cltarted by Mine-Mill Research department on a

easier. Year profits per share are~»shown through 1947 and on a

(Arizona’s Magma Copper
company is in the profit pa-
rade, too, despite its manipu-
lated cost accounts involving
abnormally large expenses for
development and expansion.
The way 1959 is shaping up,
it should show the biggest prof-
it ever made by Magma.)

“The picture is the same all
around the industry," says the

_ Report. “In a very real sense,

these booming copper profits,

are coming out of the lower-
ing of. industry labor costs by

over $35,000,000 per year re- ,

sulting from layoffs, speed-up
and widespread disregard for
health _and safety that have

made it tougher for every man

still on the job."

Commenting on a ,Wall

1958 and predicted “consider-
ably higher” earnings in 1959,
the Research Report says. this

would mean the second largest" ’

net proﬁt earned by the com-
pany in the last 30 years. It
would also mean that Anacon-

it ‘made in 1955 with copper at
37 cents. -

work to push‘ up profits.
