ANNUAL REPORT
of
EDWARD E. STRONG

National Executive Secretary

I wish to tell the simple story of our beginning. Fourteen
months ago, on the historic birthday of Frederick Douglass and

‘ Abraham Lincoln, we met in Richmond. For America, the First

All-Southern Negro Youth Conference was new and important.
For the South it was unique and deeply signiﬁcant. We came
to Richmond, 534 of us, representing 250,000 Southern youths,
to discuss our mutual problems. We wanted to plan together to
meet them.

Did we achieve our objectives there? It was the unanimous
opinion of all who attended that we did. Our problems were no
longer academic, they had become real. We were made plainfully
aware that young people, whose tragic fortune it was to be share-
croppers and tenant farmers, were pleading for assistance. It
dawned upon us that we were “rising to manhood without the
right to vote.” On every tongue there arose the cry for equality
in education. The urgent need for facilities in recreation was
brought to us. Countless times we were told the story of Negro
youth with idle hands and minds and bodies——~bec.ause they could
find no work to do. They were the step-children, far removed
from the inner family of our industrial system. Nleeting on
American soil, we witnessed the rape of Ethiopia and Spain by
the Bubonic plague of the modern world, fascism, and we under-
stood that this barbarism was a threat to the peace and the lives
of our own people-

We organized the Southern Negro Youth Congress to meet

these situations. Some asked, "But why a Southern Negro Youth '

Congress?” Why this appeal to sectionalism? Why not an
American Negro Youth Congress? We wanted a vehicle of co-
operation for Southern youth. This special instrument was needed
because Southern young peop-le face special problems, problems
which arise out of the historical development of our nation. The
peculiar feudal ecolnomy of the South was emphasized by Presi-
dent Roosevelt in his Gainesville, Georgia address of 'March 23rd.
Only to the extent that there are sectional problems in the South
may it be said that the Congress is a sectional institution. Fun-
damentally our horizon is as broad as all humanity.

The organization and maintenance of the Congress by the
youth of the South is proof enough of the ajbility of that youth.
It is evident that youth is able to participate on a basis of com-
plete equality in the growing American youth movement. It can

share in the leadership of the World Youth Movement.

The Southern Negro Youth Congress is a part of the tradi-
tions of the nation and of the South. The abundant life, the right
to live, equality of all mankind; this was the prevailing idea
when Daniel Boone made his way through the hills of Tennessee
and Kentucky in days gone by. He was the leader of the Caval-
cade of the first American frontiersmen. Of pioneer stock he
came, he led sturdy mean and women who wanted freedom; men
and women who wanted to be secure in earning their livelihood.
As Daniel Boone entered the portals of Tennessee, so we have
come today. Youthful frormtiersmen and Cavalcaders, we are
seeking for ourselves and our people, as Daniel Boone sought
for himself and his people, the abundant life.

Yes, from Plymouth to Valley Forge, from Bunker Hill to
Gettysburg, from the Emancipation Proclamation to Roosevelt’s,
“We have just begun to fight”, the underlying creed of American
democracy has been that every citizen has a right to vote.

We can not fail to mention the immortal struggles of those
noble men and women who hav-e left for us as for none other,
the unexampled splendor of the lives they lived and willingly
gave in freedom’s cause. I refer, of course, to the great aboli-
tionists and slave leaders; to Douglass and Garrison and Phillips,
John Brown and Harriet Tubman; Elijah Lovejov and Nat
Turner- ‘ '

Thus, from the first days of life on this new continent, these
men and women, countless others too inumerous to mention, gave
their lives that the American dream might become a reality. Like
them, we too, are crusaders—for “freedom, equality and oppor-
tunity.” In the words of one young leader who has caught the
vision of a new world, we are crusading, "to achieve the full
blessings of true democracy for ourselves, our people and our
nation.”

But as the democratic idea becomes acceptable to ever in-
creasingly large numbers in the world, there are a pernicious, de-
termined few who are insisteint that it shall not triumph. Since we
met fourteen months ago they have grown more bold and mighty.
In other lands their arch-representatives flagrantly deny the rights

of the people. Tlhe worst scourge that mankind faces today—fas--

cist barbarism—-is waging war against civilization. It is brazen in
its ‘disregard for the rights of man; it is destroying culture. The
fascists have raised as a paramount issue in the politics of the
world, the mythical idea‘ of racial superiority.

Hitler has found it necessary to stifle the minds of the Ger-
man people with hatred and malice. He teaches them amilitant na-
tionalism——a nationalism of vituperation against minority groups.
And for what purpose? To what end is this campaign being con-
ducted? It is to destroy, through little leaden bullets .and__ immacu-

1f1

late portions of race hatred, all opposition from the German
people. This lack of opposition will witness an exploitation un-
precedented in human history. Above all, Hitler has destroy-ed
the German youth movement. He has subjected the youth to his
will. He has quenched in a flood of terror and archaic propa-
ganda, the hopes and aspirations of the Jewish youth, a minority
group in a land of fascism.

We are often prone to believe that this upsurge of human
degradation has no conceivable counterpart in our own land;
that no matter how difficult our way may be in this American
republic, we are at least free from the threat of fascist domina-
tion. How erroneous is this impressiom! Dr. William E. Dodd,
former amlbassador to Germany, speaking in Chattanooga last
Wednesday evening, clearly indicated the urgeincy of this threat.
Hundreds of anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic and anti-Negro organi-
zations are springing up with alarming rapidity. Dr. Dodd stated
clearly the duty of youth to rally to the cause of democracy.

What better illustration of the callous determination of men
in our own country to tighten the chains of enslavement which
bind us, than the recent Senatorial multi-ringed circus—the fili-
buster against the anti-lynching bill! We had come to believe
that there were no longer men in America who dared express,
with such absolute impunity, these slanders against our people.
But Messrs. Bilbo and Ellender and their associates have taught
us a lesson. They have imformed us, as we have never been in-
formed before, that America has no lack of men and groups who,
not merely oppose legislation to blot out lynchings, but who are
striving to nullify the great victory which our forefathers 'won
almost four score years ago.

It has been with the keen recognition that such men and
groups today are tireless in their struggle against us, that we
have cq'nductecl the activities of the Southern Negro Youth
Congress since last we met. We have been constantly reminded by
the pressure of world events and national happenings that there
is no time to lose in uniting our ranks and plunging into the
thick of the fray if we are to win our just rights and privileges as
citizens of America and members of a world community of peoplesf

We must record here tonight the achievements of this p-ast
year. Before doing so, however, let us pause for a moment in
silence, in memory of one whose promise was great and whose de-
votion to the ideals of Negro youth was unsurpassed. Last year in
Richmond he was with us, and largely responsible for our small
measure of success; since then we have been parted from him
by the great leveler of all men——death! I ask for a moment's sil-
ence in memory of a, true son of the Negro people, William

Randolph.

Since our first meeting in Richmond, our tempo of develop-
ment has been on the increase. Our achievements may not have
been excessive in number, but they have been vital. Whatever we
have accomplished has been done with the idea of rendering to
our people and to our country the service that we felt was our
dut .

yLet us enumerate some of these major achievements. Surely
they can serve to guide us in days to come:

1. The organization of 5,000 tobacco workers in Richmond,
Virginia.

2. The beginning of a Negro Community Theatre, the first
of its kind in the South.

3. The establishment of Youth Councils in twenty commu-
nities.

4. The sponsorin of four tours which carried youth leaders
into the states of Nor Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Virginia
and West Virginia, reaching thousands of people with the message
of the Youth Congress.

5. The holding of a Youth Leadership Seminar at Kings
Mountain, North Carolina.

6. The distribution of 15,000 Proclamations of Southern
Negro Youth.

7. Participation in outstanding national gatherings of young
people such as the Model Youth Congress, National Council of
the American Youth Congress, the annual conference of the
Youth Division of the National Negro Congress, etc.

_ 8. Support of the anti-lynch campaign conducted by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

9. Support of the National Urban League Vocational Op-
portunity campaign.

10. Campaign on the question of Social Hygiene. .9

11. Support of the National Youth Act.

12. Stimulation of interest among Negro youth in the cul-
ture of our people through the presentation of Roland Hayes,
Eva Elessye, radio speeches and participation in Negro History‘
Wee .

The accomplishment of these things has been a test of our
sincerity and our capabilities as an organization. We feel we
have acquitted ourselves well. Yet when we think of the grievous

and manifold problems of Negro youth, we feel we have done

only a small portion of our share.

Many» things may be mentioned here as factors which have
limited the scope or enormity of our ventures. We will but men-
tion the most important. Four things stand uppermost for our
consideration: leadership among young people, not enough con?
sultation and guidance with our elders, too few functioning
councils, and lack of facilities at our disposal and the ever-present

13

financial blues.

What is wrong with the leadership of our youth movement?
What are we to do about it? The strivings of Negro youth for
manhood status must be implemented and guided by young men

and women trained in the tasks of influencing developments in‘

society.

Such-a leadership must meet the severe test of understanding
the complex and vexing intricacies of ' the world in which we
live. Thus, above all else, the leadership must study and learn.
We cannot move forward on mere speculation of hypothesis. We
must have the facts concerning the past and the present as it
effects our people as well as all men. We cannot indulge in too
much exhortation in this matter; Negro youth of the South, we
must study!

What, now, are we to do with our accumulated arsenal_ of
facts? We must act! We must imbue ourselves with that courage
which is the prerequisite of accomplishment; we must master the
techniques for putting our convictions into motion.

The second factor limiting our accomplishments has been
the lack of orgamized councils throughout the South. Our task
will only have begun when every city, large and small; every
town and village where Negroes reside, has been able to establish
a virile medium for the cooperative activity of all of our talents
and energies and agencies in the projects we must pursue. 

A word, too, should be said of our relations with our elders.
Countless times we have declared that the organized activity’ of
youth which finds expression through the Southern Negro Youth
Congress, is not a movement in defiance of those who have gone
before us. We are able to move forward only because many have
played this game before, and gotten results. We would consult
them as to how they interpret the rules of the game. We are
anxious to avoid any pitfalls which they have been successful in
hurdling. We seek to mold our program and our activity giving
due consideration to their counsel and advice. We can do no less
than this for the reasdn that our problems, though peculiar -to us
as youth, are an inseparable part of the great problem which con-
fronts all Americans born with the darker skin; the problem of
achieving our status as men in an unfriendly world.

Let us ‘now say a word about finances. This movement of
ours needs money. We have worked during the last year without
support from other sources whatsoevern The funds for the or-
ganization of this conference were raised entirely by the National
Office. Whatever finances we have had during the year were
raised in a similar manner. It is necessary, if the Congress is
going to effectively grow during the coming year, to solve in
this conference the matter of finances. '

Negro Youth of the South! We stand in the midst of this,

14

 

 

. _......-.§

our second great eﬂort to take our rightful place in the sun.
Even as we meet, additiqnal thousands of young Negroes in
other sections of our land are contemplating actions similar to
this conference.

As we congregate here in Chattanooga, we are joined with
them in our minds and in our hearts. With them we aim to form
the advance guard in the strivings of our people for justice.

Nor can we forget that there are others in America besides
ourselves, others whose problems as youth are one with ours.
To the white young men and women of our nation, we extend
the welcome halnd of fraternity. We seek to work together with
them for the common good of all. .

The tasks we have elected to fulfill are great. The need of
the hour is that we act swiftly, intelligently and effectively. Thus
only can we assure to ourselves and to. future generations a world
free from man’s inhumanities to man. Time, “the subtle thief
of youth” advances and we have much to do while yet we are
young.

Hands locked together and with heads erect, we march into
the future. We are Americans. We are the hope of our people.
We have the right to live.

THE QUEST FOR DEMOCRACY
Professor Rayford W- Logan ‘
Professor of History, Atlanta University

We see in the world today a struggle for the maintenance
of Democracy. Democracy, as imperfect and incomplete as it is,
has been achieved largely through force of arms and it may well
be that it will have to be preserved through force of arms. We
can not help, therefore, but have deep concern at the prevalance of
pacificism on the American college campus. We have “peace
experts” who have never taken a course in history beyond the
freshman and sophomore level, and consequently they are com-
pelled to repeat parrot like, certain generalizations that at best are
half-truths and which demonstratedly in many instances are
entirely false.

As an example they say that there has never been a good
war, or a bad peace. In clear contradiction to this unfounded gen-
eralization, the American Civil War was a beautiful, a glorious
war. It freed three million Negroes from the abominable in-
stitution of slavery. Colored American youths instead of living
in a dream world of peace should therefore re-adjust their think-
ing to the possible necessity of going to war to preserve Dem-
ocracy, however imperfect and incomplete it may be.

Everyone understands that there are inconsistences in Amer-

15

 

ican Democracy. In many respects the South is as fascist, as is Italy
or Germany. President Roosevelt, in his Gainsville, Georgia ad-
dress stated that the feudal South is deﬁnitely akin to fascism.
But not even the President of the United States gave the whole
picture. Fascism means, among other things, government by one
party. So long as the South is solidly Democratic and so long
as the decision of the United States Supreme Court, barring Ne-
groes from the Democratic primaries, remains the law of the
land, the South politically is as fascist as is Italy or Germany.
However, the American Bramd of Democracy, despite all its

' shortcomings is preferable to fascism.

I suggest the following three procedures for Negro youth.
First, register! and vote whenever possible in order to acquire the
habit of voting. Second, as soon as the members of the Supreme
Court appear to be sufficiently liberal, a new case should be
brought: to determine. the constitutionality of barring Negroes
from the primaries of the party that controls the South. Third,
Negroes should help to foster the attitude of the small group of
liberals in the South who believe that the Negro should be al-
lowed to vote in the Democratic primaries.

_I,-Iowever dark the picture may be now, we must continue our
fight. There can be no defeat. There is only the postponement
of Victory.

WHAT PRICE FREEDOM

DR. ' C.l"IARL*OTTE HAWKINS BROWN
President and Founder Palmer Memorial Institute

“He who would be free, himself, must strike the first blow.”
Nobody gives anybody anything, nowadays. But first of all, we
must face the truth about ourselves, and stop dealing in platitudes,
declarations, and vain resolves. We as a racial group must find
out our weak points  where-our strong points are, and apply
our hearts and eﬂorts to working these out. .

We must sense our position as a minority group. Deny as
we may, the fact is not dbliterated that we are still living in a
white man’s world. We have helped to make it through our labor
and other contributions, but he still owns it. Our problem is to
try some way to prepare better ways to come into our share.

We must arrive at a certain racial philosophy in regards to
this whole problem.‘ We hear of no instances of Negroes today
spending evenings thinking things through. There are plenty of
evenings of jazz, bridge and the whatnots that are only passing
materialistic fancies, but none contributing to thought, solidarity
of purpose and unity of ideals. The train to the land of freedom
is not an express, nor is the method of travel by high powered

16

airplanes, but by slow moving freight that stops at every back
door.

In our efforts to secure freedom we must understand that
there has to  freedom for all. The Negro must realize that in
his struggle for rights, freedom and opportunity, his entire group
must rise.’ The alleged high-‘brows must realize that to be alleged
low-brows of the group are human entities and constitute the big-
gest part of the problem of which we complain, and for which
we seek solution.

It takes time for the evolution and development of any race
in an economically and politically changing world. Therefore,
we must be patient. Build for your children. These things that
you and I want do not happen overnight. For future gains there
must be self denial and sacrifice of present joys. Remember, we are
a poor people, and if we invest in substantial channels, the money
we (sipend in showmans-hip and petty frivolities, it will go far to-
war attaining the goal we hqpe for our progeny. As it is, the
Negro today, buys what he wants and begs for what he needs.

I am for democracy. I am for participation and intergration
in all aﬁairs of the communities in which we live. And until the
young Negro learns the value of paying his poll tax and casting
his vote, regardless of numbers, he is no citizen.

I left my mother at the point of death to come here to
Chattanooga to tell Southern .Negro youth to press forward,
prepare, be sacriﬁcial, vote, work hard, but don’t be foolish.

THE ROAD AHEAD

J. HARVEY KERNS, Secretary

Division of Negro Welfare, Community Chest of Cincinattiv
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am happy to greet this assembly, especially the young peo-
ple, some who have left their homes and come fifty, a hundred
and some five hundred miles or more, to receive information,
to exchange views and get inspiration from this Congress. It is
well that you gather in such an epoch making conference for
the "Road Ahead” calls not only for brave hearts and ready
hands——it ' calls for a knowledge of the social and economic
changes which are taking place. You have come to Chattanooga,
not only to give your own views on the effect of these changes
on yourselves and your community, but my thought is just that
you come to gain a broader knowledge of social problems and
social objectives.

‘Depression problems have focused attention to the situation
facing American Youth. We are conscious of the fact that 20,-
000,000 young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-

17

,_._,_____.._.__...__._.g,...._‘

four face a confusing and dangerous future. It is estimated that
5,000,000 are unemployedand out of school and 4,000,000 are
still in school preparing for emp-lolyment. There are roughly
speaking about 2,500,000 Negro youth between the ages of six-
teen. and twenty-four. They face the same confused world as
other groups plus the difficulties aggravated ‘by their color.

This depression disaster for the Negro has swept away from
him thousands of jobs which he held in many fields. It has
robbed him of many homes through the process of foreclosure.
It has undermined faith. Today, in the wake of this economic
disaster, stands more than 5,000,000 unemployed Negroes many
who will never again be employed in gainful occupations; in
this wake stands more than 3,000,000 Negro youth, many who
toiled in the fields, worked in the shops, dug in the mines, or
followed the admonition of their elders, and earned the coveted,
academic, or professional diploma. Here they stand at the cross
roads looking at the “Road Ahead.” On the one hand he sees
vast areas of employment completely closed to Negro job-seekers
as if it were a matter of legal requirement. More than 75% of
Negro labor is engaged in unskilled and semi-skilled capacities,
while in every state, huge financial and mercantile enterprises
which employ hundreds of thousands of white collar workers,
give black applicants absolutely no consideration.

Never before has the hopes of the world centered more de-
ﬁnitely and strongly on youth than today. Never before has
the Negro needed the enthusiasm, the courage, the intelligence of
youth than today. The fact that about 30,000 Negro youth are
today attending the colleges and universities of the Country, is
an acceptance of the truth that education is an indespensible tool
to clear the Road Ahead of much of the human destruction. Not
only is there need for educated youth, but there is a need for
strong character development in youth. Education and character
combined with courage sound the clarion call to the youth of
today to marshall their forces and to march steadily onward to
obliterate those agencies which are obstacles or barriers in the

path that leads to the Road Ahead.

The Road Ahead calls for freedom of thought, conviction and
emotion. Only as ygu become free, can you have the ability to
set free the speech and emotions of those who are suppressed. The
Negro of the South with the many social, political, industrial and
agricultural problems, needs a leadership of Negro youth as they
approach the Road Ahead. This new leadership must have en-
thusiasm, interests, and ideals which may be shared with, but
which are not limited to the groups which may be circumscribed
by class or party. This new leadership must help in concrete
situations, not only in improving home and industrial conditions,

18

W____ ....«...».l...........;..,...._,r..... ..    ., .. ,  . _ .  ..

but in the encouraging, and forming trade unions, cooperatives,
and consumers leagues.

On the Road Ahead, Negro youth has met and will continue
to meet new competition. Negro youth who formerly competed
with white youth for apprentice jobs, now find themselves com-
peting against not only white youth, but Negro and white adult
workers as well. The F. E. R. A. in 1935 found that Negroes had
lost jobs twice as fast as white during the depression and were
finding others twice as slowly.

The time has come when we must gird ourselves for battle,
against increasing social problems. The time has come to advance
and for this advance we must clear our ranks of any unnecessary
impediments, of any detachments that are afraid to go resolutely
forward, of any forces that wish to hold back with their eyes
fixed on the past rather than the future.

These, my friends, are objectives on the Road Ahead which
will add to us all, strength and character, content in living, con-
serve democracy and provide some equality of opportunity where
none now exists. . -

FINDINGS OF PANELS

CITIZENSHIP

The question of securing full citizenship for the Negro in
the South involves four major problems: voting, poll taxes, jury
service and lynching. Dr. James E. Jackson _Ir., pointed the general
direction of the discussion toward first, establishing a definite
program of organization for the right to vote; and secondly,
toward supplying each state with a legislative program for its
peculiar needs. With these purposes in mind, the following analy-
sis of the present situation was made together with plans for im-
mediate action.

The right to vote and full participation in the privileges of
citzenship are vital to the further progress of our people. We
stand today with our rights severely and illegally restricted. But
we are encouraged by the fact that throughout the country we see
powerful currents of progress stirring the people. The people
descending on the polls are winning increasing victories for dem-
ocracy. Old party labels and boundaries are being shattered as
the people move politically to extend the benefits of true popular
government. -

This powerful sentiment on the part of America to move
forward the frontier of democracy, is now entering our Southland.

Southern Democrats from Oklahoma, and Missouri, and one
from Texas voted for the Wagner-Van Nuvs Anti-Lynch Bill,
Labor and New Deal Democrats in Virginia, Tennessee and Ala-

bama ﬁght -now for the abolition of poll taxes in their states. ‘We
counsel our people to welcome with extended hand the new pro-
gressive trends among Southern white people, for we know, and
we would have them know that ours is no separate battle. Three-
fourths of the Southern people, Negro and white, are disfran-
chised. For the most part those Southern represe-ntatives in the
nation’s Congress, in local and State governments are not our
representatives. The people of the South must be mobilized to
vote out of office those who do not represent their best interest
and replace them with true representatives of the people. We
shall accomplish this by winning the right to vote and full privil-
eges of citizenship.

We call upon Southern Negro youth to take a leading part
in organizing immediate, practical means to restore the full privil-
eges of citizenship to every eligible voter by:

1. Organized institutes for citizenship in every community,
for the purpose of studying and mastering the present election
laws; the jury service regulations, and the basic Constitutional
guarantees——thus achieving the broadest possible education of
eligible voters, and enabling them to challenge and defeat infrac-
tions of the election laws.

2. Organizing poll tax paying clubs; asking organizations
to put money into a treasury to pay poll taxes; organizing poll
tax committees to cover the communities and collect the poll tax;
establishing registration centers in every neighborhood. In this
way the maximum vote may be polled under existing conditions;
poll tax disfranchisement and corruption defeated, and prepara-
tions made to utilize instantly any further extension of suffrage
won by the citizens of the South.

3. We should consciously prepare to ally the special pro-
gram of the youth and the whole Negro people with that of the
rising forces of progress in the South and the entire country,
particularly the modern labor movement. Steps in this direction
would include the full use of every friendly political force of the
progressive elements within the dominant political party in the
South, sugh as securing or fighting for greater popular partici-
pation in party conventions -and primaries. In addition, we must
participate -in the political conferences and the conventions of
organized_labor wherever they occur in the South, taking a more
decisive part in drawing up labor’s independent legislative pro-
gram; emphasizing the fact that the Negro people have grievances
and interests in common with other disfranchised sections of the
population, and at the same time are the victims of special dis-
crimmation.

As part of our program, we urge support of the following
specific legislative measures:

1. The Wagner-Van Nuys Anti-Lynching Bill.
90

vnv!" q-.-.

2. The Wages and Hours Bill with provisions against dif-
ferentials in wages between the North and South and between
Negro and White.

3. Passage of legislation to provide useful work of all cit-
izens at trade union wages, as proposed by the Worker’s Alliance.

4. Schwellenback-Allen Bill for relief of the unemployed.

5. American Youth Act for extension of N Y A appropri-
ations.

6. Amendments to the Jones Tenancy Bill, incorporating
the proposals of the Boileau Bill: ~

‘a. to increase the appropriations;

b. to democratize its administration through the election
of administrative committees by tenants and sharecroppers through
which all land purchases should be made.

c. to provide equitable distribution of land among both
Negro and White tenants with preference for those in greatest
nee; ‘ '= ~«'=If!IAi’3

cl. to lengthen terms of re-payment to 40 years and to re-
duce the rate of interest to 1%%.

7. Amendments to the Wagner-Steagal Housing Bill to
increase appropriations and to democratize its administration, in
order to make possible widespread housing projects at low rentals
in both city and country. » '

8. Support of the Harrison-Fletcher-Black Bill for federal
aid to education as amended to incorporate the proposals of the
recent Report of the President’s Committee on Education.

9. Both Federal and State bills "to abolish all restriction on
voting, such as poll taxes, accumulated poll taxes, property quali-
fications. , ‘ " h

10. Securing the right to participate in Party primaries which,
in states dominated by one p.arty, are decisive for the election.‘

11. We recognize the tie-up between war and fascism both
here and abroad, between the forces of facism and the stimula-
tion of racial persecution both here and abroad. We, therefore,
call for the defeat of afnti-democratic elements seeking to destroy
popular government in our own country. We urge that the Negro
people who already suffer special oppression support the policy
of collective security as outlined by President Roosevelt last
October. We see no contradiction between joining to fight for
popular rule and the rights of citizenship in our own country,
and joining in collective guarantees internationally to stay the
hand of fascist racial persecution, to relieve the attacked peoples
of Spain,_Ethiopia and China, to maintainpeace, to oppose the
isolationist policy subtly leading*us*to war. V, .

JOB SECURITY

In these trying times, all Americans recognize “the necessity

21

 

for understanding how present economic conditions relate to them-
selves and to their communities. In these times, when coping with
the problems of job security and unemployment in America de-
mands not only such understanding but also ability on the part
of the people to express their needs, Southern Negro youth are
urged to organize and to study their unemployment problems in
order to be better able to help themselves.

It is recommended that the Southern Negro Youth Congress
continue to help furnish leadership for the unionization of Ne-
groes and to encourage their active participation in bonafide labor
unions. The group opposes any discrimination within the unions,
especially, that policy of the American Federation of Labor which
excludes Negroes from enjoying the benefits of its vocational
guidance service. That barrier against Negroes must be let down.
Since unemployment is widely prevalant among Negro youth, un-
employed groups also must be encouraged to organize and to deal

Domestic workers and farmers are especially subject to
unemployment and to sudden deprivation of their means of live-
lihood. To provide for such exigencies, it is urged that the So-
cial Security Act be extended to include domestic workers and
farmers within its benefits. Attention is called also to the Negro
miners who live under squalid conditions in the mining camps;
the Southern Negro Youth Congress will support any agencies
which investigate these conditions and work toward their allevia-
tion.

In our local communities throughout the South, we urge the
Churches, the Young Men’s and Women’s Christian Associations,
land the various social centers to set up Job Clinics as a means of
aiding Negroes to find jobs. We also petition the various boards
of education, school superintendents, principals, and college pres-
idents to devote more attention to vocational guidance in Negro
high schools and colleges.

From the national government we ask equal opportunities
for Negro workers in all its Federal projects, to set an example
for private industry in wiping out discrimination against the Ne-
gro. We exp-ress our opposition to the photographic method of
identification in Civil Service Applications and recommend that
the Virtillian method be substituted. For our Negro women, we
petition the Works Progress Administration to inaugurate a pro-
gram of placement service to be conducted together with their
present program of household training for all women, and we
protest the practice of some local WPA officials who place Negro
women on the highways and streets to perform manual labor.
We lend our wholehearted and continued support to the program
which the Pittsburgh Courier has launched to secure equal op-
portunities for Negros in the United States Army, Navy and

22

 

 

Aviation Corps.

_Finally, convinced as we are of the democratic principles
upon which the Tennessee Valley Authority was established, we
deplore certain discriminatory practices in violation of that spirit
which have crept into its administration. These practices include
the relegation of Negroes to unskilled and to a few semi-skilled
occupations; the complete exclusion of Negro workers from the
Hiwassee Dam; the exclusion of Negroes from houses in the
N_orris Dam; and the failure of the Tennessee Valley Authority
to provide adequate vocational training facilities for Negroes who
work on its projects. We therefore recommendthat the Second
All-Southern Negro Youth Conference send formal protests to
all members of the Congressional Committee recently appointed
to investigate the Tennessee Valley Authority, and we ask that
this committee investigate and report on racial discrimination in
the operation of the TVA.

A PROGRAM FOR NEGRO EDUCATION

Negro youth in the South for many years have suffered from
the lack of educational opportunities more than any other group
in the country. The Negro school in the South faces glaring
inequalities in the length of its term as compared with the white
school, in the equipment of the school itself, in the scope of its
curricula, in the salaries of its teachers, and the expenditure per
capita of public funds for the education of the Negro child.
Added to these inequalities, Southern Negro youth suffer from
those problems facing all American youth in schools: the denial
of academic freedom and inadequate vocational and social guid-
ance. Cognizant of these conditions, the panel recommends that
the Southern Negro Youth Congress make special efforts to
remedy them.

The Congress supports the Harrison-Fletcher-Black Bill for
federal aid to education, so amended as to include the recommen-
dations suggested in the recent report of the President’s Advisory
Committee on Education. For immediate action it recommends
first, that the Congress establish a committee which will make an
organized drive to equalize educational opporunities throughout
the Southern states. Such a committee would promote a pictorial
campaign depicting the poor conditions of Negro s-chools——send
those pictures and related literature to the National Educational
Association, to the Negro teachers’ association in all Southern
states, American Feder.ation of Teachers, etc., and place a pic-
torial exhibit or display at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York.
Such a Committee would sufpport, in the name of the Congress,
a campaign of propaganda to expose the differences in the
amount of public money spent for the education of the white

child and the Negro child. The Committee should be composed
Q3

 

of one .person from each Southern state who will name his work-
ing committee, the original committee will elect one of its num-
ber as chairman who will also serve as publicity director.

The panel further recommends that a department for vo-
cational guidance be set up in the Congress to furnish information
and suggestive outlines for a program to local committees. On

the other hand, each community organization shall adopt some ,

type of vocational guidance program and make reports on its
work to the department at regular intervals during the year.

Finally, among students, the panel recommends the establish-
ment of student governing bodies on the campus and the initiation
of work to make the college program two-fold, both cultural and
social.

R E L I G I 0 N
CHRISTIAN YOUTH BUILDS A NEW WORLD

The panel on religion sought to find how youth in the church
could participate in building a new world. To face these tasks,
youth must adopt a broad philosophy of life, and .approach the
needs of the whole world in an open minded mainner. Christian
youth must prepare for this work first by individually determin-
ing what it means to be Christli.ke, then preparing one’s self for
Christian work ‘by taking advantage of every possible opportunity
to secure religious education. Each youth who plans to follow
a Christlike program must rid himself of racial prejudice; think
less of returning evil for evil; and try to win. someone else to his
point of view. It is realized, however, that the individual can not
be made entirely right until the world is made right. People must
be brought to understand their present plight; so long as we are
satisfied with selfishness, hate, and injustice in society, the
church will not succeed. A hunger for love, justice, and peace
must be created, and the faith of our people in right and truth
rekindled. When each person carries out Christ’s idea, we will
establish a new economic order.

Christian youth, working within the church and facing to-
day’s new problems must use today’s techniques for Christian
purposes. Christian youth must identify themselves with all the
crucified: young people out of college who have never had a
job; rural and city boys and girls who have never had a chance;
sharecr_Qppers; youth in schools—all must work together. Certain
techniques may be employed such as the formation of church
and community reading clubs, debating teams, the promotion of
interracial conferences and interdenominational cooperation, the
display of placards and slogans to educate the public, the con-
ducting of temperence crusades and peace parades. All must be

24

 

organized, adult -as well .as youth groups for definite Christian
social action.

For the Southern Negro Youth, the participants in the panel
recommend specifically, first, that young people take the initia-
tive in their localities’ of formulating a program of Christian
action, and take the responsibility of interpreting this program
to the ministers and lay leadership on the church and the com-
munity. Ministers are urged to become better informed on the
ideas and attitudes of youth, and to cooperate actively with
the needs ,and interests of young people in the various communi-
ties. Next it is recommended that Christian leadership training
institutes {be established through the cooperative efforts of the
churches in the community, on the one hand to create genuine
Christian fellowship and understanding between youth and adult
leaders; on the other hand, to help young people acquire Chris-
tian educational techniques for teaching Sunday School, Daily
Vacation Bible School, and supervised recreation. Last, Chris-
tian young people must cooperate with all youth groups that have
for their purpose interracial fellowship and understanding. In
this connection, the panel recommends that the basis for fellow-
ship be broader than the discussion of race, and that it include
such activities as hikes, debates, community singing, and recrea-

tional and religious institutes.

RURAL YOUTH

The major problems of rural Negro youth may be classified
under four general headings: first, those problems arising from
their limited educational opportunity and facilities; secondly,
problems arising from the absence of recreational facilities; third-
ly, the difficulties resulting from a lack of vocational and social
guidance; fourthly, the evils inherit in the farm-tenancy and
share-cropping systems.

To cope with these difficulties, the panel recommended first,
participation in such organizations as already exist for the service
of rural youth: taking advantage of educational opportunities
offered by the Smith-Hughes Program; the Smith-Lever program;
the National Youth Administration; the 4H Clubs; the Young
Men’s and Woinen’s Christian Associations; the Parent-Teacher
League; State College Extension Services; Government Extension
Services, and numerous other agencies. The panel iendorsed
various programs now before the Federal Government which
would benefit the rural youth; specifically, the February 1935
recommendations of the President’s Committee on Education.
The group also recommended the establishment of post-graduate
high school courses, correspondence courses and a type of ap-
prenticeship training free from the danger of industrial exploita-
tion for those unable to- obtain a college education It further

25

, \‘ » . — -'9
_ .';......._;.j ‘T ;“;'1_f-I 1*—1‘1'—“‘—’-‘J31’

urged support of the Boileau amendments to the Jones Tenancy
Bill which would (1) increase appropriations for buying land and
making loans to tenants, (2) secure the democratic administration
of such a fund through local committees elected from the tenant
farmers and sharecroppers, (3) give preference to those tenants
most in need, providing ‘benefits impartially to either Negro or
white applicants, (4) lower the rate of interest to 1%% and
lengthen the term of repayment to forty years. The panel also
indorsed the farm cooperative plan, and suggested the extension
of the Wagner Labor Act to include agricultural workers.

As an immediate program for rural Negro youth, the panel
recommended for the problem of education, the organization of
community forums, discussion groups, study groups; for recrea-
tion, the establishment of community centers in as many areas
as possible for both youth and older persons; on the question
of guidance, the organization of councils coordinating the efforts
of all agencies in a community——the school, church, civic leagues,
clubs, farm agents, to learn of and plan for the local problems
confronting youth; for the tenant f.armer and sharecropper,
Group organization was suggested wherever possible to bring
about a better understanding of mutual problems and their sol-

ution.

MARRIAGE AND HOME LIFE

Among the factors making for a successful marriage and
home life, seven were considered of special importance, namely,
affection, sex, religion, fellowship, economic security, health,
parenthood.

No attempt has been made by the panel to list these factors
in order of importance, for all are integrally a part of a happy
home life. Affection is characterized by the continuation of at-
tention, courtesies, mutual consideration and cooperation through
the years of married life. Maladjustment in sex relations fre-
quently causes the dissolution of marriage, and usually because
young people have no access to scientiﬁc information on sex or
education for marriage. Religion is another bond in marriage.
Denominational differences, it is agreed, should -not disrupt the
unity within the home for all are worshippers of the same God.
Here fellowship, which depends upon the understanding existing
between two people, their common interests and mutual toler-
ance, can help develop the integration necessary in married life.

Economic security is of basic importance in married life.
Tradition looked upon the husband as the mental and physical
superior of his wife, and head of the house because he was sole
breadwinner. In the last two decades, when many women have
become wage workers and have entered professions and business,
this old attitude is outworn. For happiness in the home, both

26

 

 

husband and wife must cooperate in solving economic problems.
Finally, youth must be fitted for marriage and parenthood through
the preservation of health. Tuberculosis makes great ravages an-
nually among Negro youth, and the social diseases have taken
their toll of mothers, and infants, and youth.

Considering these factors, the panel on Marriage and Home
Life recommends that existing organizations such as the Parent-
Teachers’ Ass~ociations, Community Councils, adult classes under
the Works Progress Administration, and ynight schools offer
courses for the public in sex education. It further recommends
that such information be made especially available for young
men and young women alike through required courses in Mar-
riage and Homemaking in the public schools and colleges. On
the problem of economic security in marriage, it is suggested
that each young person seek information on occupational op-
portunities and explore thoroughly his fitness for entrance into
certain fields, so that fewer difficulties in economic adjustment
may exist. The panel recommends specifically that the local
committees begin educational work on prevalent diseases, making
spot maps of their Communities for the location of Tuber-
culosis, and organizing round tables on the causes, detection, and
cure of this disease .as well as venereal diseases. Last, it is recom-
mended that the Southern Negro Youth Congress cooperate with
the National Tuberculosis Association and the National Hygiene
Association in their campaign for the eradication of tuberculosis

and social diseases.

CULTURE, YOUTI-I’S COMMON HERITAGE

The report of Mr. Thomas Richardson, Executive Director
of the Negro Community Theatre of Richmond, Virginia, gave
the panel on culture its orientation. To-day when democr.acy is
universally threatened, and when the Negro people have achieved
only a partial democracy, we must consider how cultural forces
and the culture of; our people can play a definite role in helping
us achieve freedom, equality, and opportunity. If Negro culture
is to realize the potentialities made manifest in its heritage, it
can not exist in an ivory tower. The great cultural expression of
our people, the Negro srpirituals and folk-lore, have embodied
the desire of the entire race for freedom in a time of oppression;
our poets, Phyllis Wheatley and Paul Lawrence Dunbar, contin-
ued this tradition unchanged. As any great culture expresses the
needs and desires of the majority of a people, we must understand
that _the majority of our people are workers struggling for eco-
nomic security and for democratic rights. If we are to accept and
expand our heritage, we must rally the cultural forces in each
community to pool their resources with those of labor in this
struggle- In this unity there is strength, for our cultural heritage

97

 

 

has been moulded thus far despite the economic and social limi-
tations imposed upon our people. ’We have, therefore, the nec-
essary background to build a vital movement. Let us take the
first step in a national cultural program that will help to bring
our people freedom, equality, and opportunity. ~ ~ '

Tp initiate this program it is recommended that the Southern
Negro Youth Cpngress establish a National Cultural Committee
which will‘ be responsible for the coordination of youth activities
in the fine arts on a national scale, and working with the National
Committee shall be an advisory group consisting of outstanding
people in the field of culture. ‘Simultaneously, local committees
should be established, affiliated with the National Committee,
with the pudpose of drawingthe people of the community into
the ﬁne arts as media of social expression. The activity of the
local committees could be-centered around the ‘establishment of
community theatres with  and music departments and
with some attention to the graphic arts." ' -

' In addition to the initiation of new * cultural ’ activity, it is
necessary for the local councils to take whatever steps they find
advisa‘ble-in support of the Federal Arts Bill HR "9102 which has
di‘-rect social advantage for Negro ‘youth in providing v jobs for
the qualified Negro artists. Another positive step must be the
inauguration of ‘a national campaign against theatre owners in
eight states: North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Ala-
bama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who have adopted
a resolution to the effect that all pictures in which Negroes ap-
pear on an equal basis with white or in other than character roles,
shall .?be cut from the films. If this resolution is” allowed to go
unchallenged, it will close the door to opportunities new existing
for Negro participation in dramatic art. An opportunity for
bringing the force of the Sou.thern_~Negro Youth Congress a-

gainst such .a resolution should not be missed‘

:-: Introduction :-:

Fellow Delegates:

The Second All-Southern Negro Youth Conference has
given us new hope and courage to go forward in the many diffi-
cult battles that are before us. Together we met and formulated
concrete plans to advance our needs. Every delegate is now fully
conscious of the conditions so pressing upon members of our
group. We know that we cannot go far without the ballot. We
know that new job and educational opportunities must be found.
We are cognizant of the great need of developing a closer bond of
fellowship with white youth. For the realization of these aims, we
are pledged to work untiringly‘ with un-bounded enthusiasm and a
clear vision of a future which we know is ours. We know that
the problems which we will have to solve are manifold, but we
will be equal to our tasks. a

The deep inspiration which prevailed throughout our con-
ference is giving new hope to thousands of Negro youth through-
out the country. The work of our conference has ended. But the
execution of the policies adopted, we’ willliend-eavor to carry out
with exactness. We now have thejob before us of building strong

youth councils i_n_ every community" Without active councils we

can not hope to achieve our 'objectives._ Each ‘delegate must now
assume the — responsibility ‘of establishing rep‘res-entative youth
councils in every southern city and village.

The maximum amount of cooperation" is needed in ﬁnancing
the work of our Congress. Delegates and their friends are asked
to send personal _contributions to . the National ,Office; get other
organizations to contribute,j_rais.e funds, through local councils,
etc. We can not over-emphasize our financial difficulties. The
National staff, has dedicated itself ._to the faithful execution ,of
the policies adopted at the Chattanooga conference. With your
assistance, and the help of friends, we will march ever forward
to new achievements.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON TIME AND PLACE

Invitations were received from Knoxville, Tenn., Oklahoma
City, Okla., and Birmingham, Ala. The Time and Place Com-
mittee recommended that Birmingham, Ala. be selected as the
site for the Third All-Southern Negro Youth Conference The
Committee further recommended that the Conference be held
April 9-11, 1939. The Field Representative was instructed to
investigate Birmingham as a possible meeting place, with the
National Council being empowered to find another meeting place
if Birmingham is not suitable.

The Report of the Committee was adopted by the conference.

6. That all local councils should work for peace, endorsing
President Roosevelt’s Chicago speech of October 5, 1937 in

ANNUAL ADDRESS
of
W'ILLIAM RICHARDSON, NATIONAL CHAIRMAN

Mr. Chairman, Negro Youth of the Southland, Ladies and
Gentlemen:

Greetings to the Second All-Southern Negro Youth Con-
ference! Since last we met, one year has passed-—a year which
has witnessed the translation into concrete programs of action
the visions and convictions of the 534 young people who. partici-
pated in the first historic Conference of Southern Negro Youth.

One year has passed—a year marked by the organization
of tobacco workers by vocational guidance programs and cam-
paigns for voters; by the estdblishment of a cultural outlet in
the form of a Negro Community Theatre; by the setting up of
a Youth Center; by a constant, ceaseless fight for Freedom, Equal-
ity and Opportunity.

One year has passed—and once more the Negro Youth of
the South have come together “for counsel and for action.” I am
happy, as we meet here in Chattanooga, to extend to you greetings
 felicitations on the auspicious opening of the Second All-
Southern Negro Youth Conference.

Not many years ago such a gathering as this could only be
brought together by such an event as the annual football classic
between Morehouse and Talledega Universities. Today, however,
many of you have come to Chattanooga only as a result of great
sacrifice to exchange fact and opinion on the most vital problems
confronting humanity. This change in the tenor of thought and
activity among our young people can be traced directly to the-
fact that we live in a rapidly changing world. Issues which were
once merely a topic of academic discussion have now been pro-
jected into our very lives.

The problems which confront our race as well as our na-
tion have been brought about by the social chaos, economic mal-
adjustment, and political upheaval of the modern world. The
300,000 Negro youth of the South out of school and searching
for jobs stand as a grim testament to an economic extremity
which cries out for swift and intelligent remedy- Our delibera-
tions must first of all suggest some tangible means of alleviating
the plight of these cast-offs of American industrial life. For the
Negro youth of the South we must find jobs; and we must secure
equal pay for equal work.

This is a fundamental need for us; joblessness is the arid
soil from which spring such spectres as the death of hope and
vision; the stifling of natural talents and aptitudes, crime and
delinquency.

But even as we speak of this dismal situation, we can see
new signs and encour.aging portents on every hand. We have be-
gun to I-ear_n that our problem is a part of the problems of all
American youth and of all American ‘breadwinners. And this
knowledge has enabled us to score significant, though insuffi-
cient, victories. The five thousand organized tobacco workers in
Richmond, Virginia—both youth and adult—can testify here that
we were correct when last year, in our PROCLAMATION OF
SOUTHERN NEGRO YOUTH, we said: “The union makes us
strong.” They can testify because their organized strength has
brought an annual increase in purchasing power amounting to
$250,000 to the Negro citizens of their city.

Our deliberations will not be complete here if we fail to give
careful consideration to the recent momentous developments
throughout the nation in the field of organized labor. A virile
and modern force has arisen among American working men and
women. It has proclaimed a doctrine of equal opportunity for
all, regardless of race, creed or color. Moreover, it has put this
doctrine into practice. Such a development has deep significance
for the South. We can do no less, in the interests of a better
America, than to welcome this innovation and to actively work
toward that time when the entire labor movement will present
new horizons of plenty for all Americans alike. '

But the problem of job opportunities for Negro youth is a
manifold one. We must also succeed in finding places for our
young people in all vocations in our land. Those of us who have
trained our ears, our eyes, and our hands for the intricate tasks
in the crafts and professions. ‘must win the opportunity to put

our training to use. To accomplish this, all Negro youth must.

work tirelessly and unitedly. .

This Conference must also give attention to our -position as
members of the family of American democracy. Recent months
have brought forth many instances of our determination to par-
ticipate equally with others as citizens in the government of our
land. We s.alute the Council of the Southern Negro Youth Con-
gress in Norfolk, Virginia, which has achieved splendid results
in its campaign to qualify .and register Negro votes. It is ex-
amples such as these that convince us that our organized activity
can and will bring closer that day when our Constitution and the
amendments thereto will be more than promissory notes.

We can not forget our solemn pledge to strive to be regarded
as men and women—and not as inferior creatures, deserving of
only an inferior status. There is still much work to do in refut-
ing through our deeds and our accomplishments the manufac-
tured myth of our inferiority as a group. The past year of activity
of our Congress has given ample proof of our merits. Our pres-

8

entation of Roland Hayes in New York’s Town Hall and of the
Eva jessye Choir in Richmond represent the voice of Negro
youth proclaiming to all America that our sweat and toil and our
talents are an inseparable portion of American culture. The
Richmond Community Theatre is added proof of our ability to
achieve.

As Negro youth of the South, we envisage and will work for
a future which will bring harmonious, warm and fraternal relation-
ships with the white youth with whom we live side by side. We
understalnd. that the grievous problems which confront us are
common among them also. We welcome those white youths and
adults who have come to observe and participate in our deli-bera-
tions tonight. We would clasp their hands and work cooperatively
for a brighter and better South. »

Nor can we forget, that as Negro youth of America, our
hearts and minds and destinies are bound together with those
of youth both‘ in other lands across the seas and in the . vast
expanses of territory to the north and south of these United
States. We join with them in the making of a better world.

Together with the youth of all lands we shall do all in our
power to bring about international stability and i’ the end of war.
The youth of the world need peace! We need peace in order
to fashion our lives as useful citizens in the world community;
we need peace in order to achieve a meaningful and more potent
maturity. We who are Negroes, especially, must have peace in
order to strive successfully for the rights, liberty and opportunity
which must be ours if we and our country are to advance among
civilized nations. We cannot fail to express our sympathy for
those youth_ today in countries across the seas whose cherished
possessions are ‘being ravaged by war. Tlo the youth of Spain,
and of war-torn China, to the minority youth of Austria which
has fallen before the barbarism of Hitler’s fascism, to the op-
pressed youth in the colonies of Africa and the Carribean—to
the youth of the world, we pledge our solidarity as willing work-
ers in the cause of advancing civilization.

We meet tdnight in Chattanooga at the beginning of a new
era. From this, our Second Conference, must come invigorating,
virile ‘blood, to flow in the veins of America’s Negro youth. Our
vision of a more equitable society draws nearer realization as

we call to order this Second All-Southern Negro Youth Confer-

CIICC.

The world today is calling upon its youth. The world to-
morrow depends upon the youth of today.

The future belongs to the youth!
