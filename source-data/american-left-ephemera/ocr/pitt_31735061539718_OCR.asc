or even if he destroyed the leaﬂet, the recruiting agent
would visit him after a time and try to persuade him to
work on behalf of the secret service. If the person in
question expressed indignation at such a proposal and
threatened to inform the authorities, the recruiting agent
would calmly remind him of the receipt and conceal-
ment of the leaflet and point out that this could easily be
proved through the postman who brought the letter, etc.

If the recruiting agent is unsuccessful at the ﬁrst at-
tempt, he is not disturbed. He visits his victim again
later on and tries to intimidate him by stating that he
would get into trouble for not reporting his ﬁrst visit to
the authorities. At ‘ﬁrst the
agent demands information of
a minor and almost not secret
character which, he says, he
needs very much. He offers his
victim money and promises
that if he consents this time
he will not trouble him any
more. If the victim yields, then
it is all up with him; having
-“consented” once, he is drag-
ged deeper and deeper into
the mire. He cannot get out of
it, because he has already com-
promised himself and he be-
comes a puppet in the hands
. of the cunning spy.

To become more intimate with the recruits they have
10

 

 

marked out for themselves, spies resort to all sorts of
methods. Not infrequently Soviet people going abroad
on business orfor a cure are suddenly “recognized" in
the train by a recruiting agent who appears to be de-
lighted at the meeting and who turns out to be a “friend
of the traveler's friend,” etc. During the long journey
the recruiting agent carefully sizes up his victim,‘ ﬁnds
out his weak spots and begins to weave his web. Very
often he takes advantage of meetings at health resorts,
where there is plenty of spare time, where there are op-
portunities for excursions and where acquaintances are
made more freely, especially with interesting and oblig-
ing people who at ﬁrst sight arouse no suspicion.

A number of cases have occurred where espionage re-
cruiting agents provided naive people with “wives.”
These wives took a “keen” interestin their husband's
work and wheedled secrets out of them. When she had
obtained sufficient material to compromise her “hus-
band” politically, such a wife revealed her cards and
bluntly proposed that he accept a well-paid job in “her”
secret service. Not all the people who found themselves
in such a situation had the courage to do the honest
thing, to extricate themselves from it. And the spies took
advantage of this to convert their involuntary and care-
less victim into a traitor. to his country. I

As a matter of fact every honest Soviet citizen has
every opportunity of thwarting the sordid designs of the
spies, of extricating himself from the web that had been
woven round him and of being useful to his country by
exposing the annoying and importunate spies. All that

~11

 

is necessary is to remember that if a mistake, or even
a serious crime has been committed it is far better to
confess it, to reveal it, to inform the Soviet authorities
about it than to enter into a secret pact with the enemy
of our country and to carry out their espionage instruc-
tions. It must be always borne in mind that anybody
who has entered into a pact with a foreign secret service
ceases to be his own master forever: beginning with in-
nocent services he is gradually compelled to act at ﬁrst
as a spy and then uncomplainingly to carry out diver-
sionist and terrorist acts. It is enough to give the spy
a ﬁnger to enable him to become complete master of
his victim and to convert an honest man into a traitor
and assassin.

This was the case, for example, with the young engi-

t neer Stroilov, who was convicted at the recent Trotskyite

espionage trial. This man was educated by the Soviet
government and trained as a specialist. Having fallen
into the hands of the spies he was gradually transformed

into a traitor to his country, a wrecker and diversionist.

At ﬁrst, while he was in Germany on Soviet business,
the German spies gave him Trotsky’s book to read, then
they began to supply him with other counter-revolution-
ary literature, and after that they began to blackmail
him, threatening to expose him to the Soviet authorities
for associating with people like the German spy Berg,
which would be enough to compromise him. Instead of
honestly revealing the machinations of the German spies
and thus saving himself from their persecution, Stroilov
preferred to hush this up, and in return for the promise

not to betray him to the Soviet authorities, he gave the
German Secret Service a written statement promising to
provide them with information they wanted anfl thus
placing himself entirely at thepmercy of the Gestapo.
He was given no rest when he returned to the U.S.S.R.
but was compelled to engage in wrecking and acts of
diversion. In this way the Gestapo erected a bridge be-
tween the spy Stroilov and the Trotskyite agents in the
Kuznetsk Basin. And yet it should be clear to every-
one that not only could Stroilov have averted the con-
temptible fate of a traitor, spy and diversionist, but by
exposing the sordid intrigues of the agents of the Ges-
tapo in time he could have been useful to his country
and remained its loyal son.

On our Soviet territory spies operate with the greatest
caution to avoid discovery by our Soviet and Party‘or-
ganizations and the organs of the People's Commissariat
of Internal Affairs; but in their own land
they behave with utmost cynicism, and 
are especially persistent with Soviet.citi- A
zens who visit that country. "Even when '
Soviet citizens are traveling through \
Poland or Germany en route to other 7
countries‘ they are accosted by “fellow
travelers” who try their utmost to sound f 4%
them out and drag them into their net.

A number of cases that have occurred
show how vigilant our engineers, busi—‘
ness leaders and other persons going
abroad on business must be in order to

is

 

 

avoid falling into traps cunningly laid for them by
foreign espionage organizations.

A certain Soviet worker, whom we shall call “L,” on
arriV'ing in a certain foreign country, decided to learn
the language of that country and advertised for a teacher.
Among the numerous replies to the advertisement there
was one in which the applicant told a moving story of
her poverty. She wrote that she was a teacher, the sole

provider of her family of three, and pleaded that the

advertiser postpone his decision to engage a teacher un-
til he had had a personal interview with her and also
urged that her knowledge of the language and method
of instruction were superior to all others. “L” was a
bachelor and among his comrades was regarded as a
good Party member, active in social work and modest
in his everyday life. Although he was engaged in tech-
nical work. his job was nevertheless a very responsible
one, for in the course of his work he learned many im-
portant state secrets. He replied to the “needy” appli-
cant and made an appointment for an interview. On
the appointed date a young, good-looking woman, about
25 years of age, who called herself Mary, called on “L”

and in the ver ﬁrst "conversation charmed him b her
Y Y

modest appearance and touched him by the story of her
poverty.

The lessons were given at “L’s” lodgings and for sev- .

eral months things proceeded quite normally. During
this period “L” became friendly with his teacher and
they began to go for walks together, to visit the movies,
etc." Gradually they became more intimate. During the

14

 

 

..Amj_._,.‘ ., 4,. ’,_.;y‘

 

lessons Mary never put any questions to “L" that might
have aroused suspicion. She appeared not to understand
much about politics, although she said that unknown
to her mother, who was very religious, she read books
about the Soviet Union and that had she had more spare

time she would undoubtedly have shared the views of

the Bolsheviks. ,
One evening, during the lesson, Mary felt bad. She
asked “L” to call a doctor, a distant relative of hers

- named  When the doctor arrived Mary became

worse and she had to lie down on the sofa. The doctor
said that she was suffering from over-fatigue and a weak
heart. He gave her a powder and said that she would
feel relief soon and fall asleep. He asked “L” not to
disturb her and allow her to remain quietly in the room.
Hours passed, Mary still slept and at 3 a.m. “L” decided
that even if she did wake up it would be too late to
allow her to go home. Tired out with his vigil, “L” fell

asleep himself.
On awakening in the morning he was astonished to

ﬁnd that Mary had gone. And he was still more aston-

‘ ished to ﬁnd that the front and back doors were locked

and the keys missing. He searched high and low for
the keys but could not ﬁnd them, and he had to tele-
phone for a locksmith tocome and break the locks. In-
stead of going to his comrades and telling them what
had happened, “L” feared that they would not believe
his story and would think that something had happened
between him and Mary, that they would not believe his
story about the disappearance of the keys, that they

15

 

 

would begin to talk about him, distort theyfacts and
create a lot of trouble for him. “I will say nothing
about it,” “L” decided, “nobody but I knows anything
about it.” He did not sus-
pect that the secret service,
whose agent Mary was, had
built all their plans pre-
cisely on this psychological
point that “L” would be
afraid to tell anybody
about Mary having stayed
the night at his lodgings

 

and about the disappear-i

ance of the keys and the broken locks.

One evening, some time after, when “L” was begin-
ning to forget these events, a stranger called and intro-
duced himself as the agent of the secret service of that

« country and stated that his chief had instructed him to
meet “L” to talk over the incident connected with Mary.

He said that Mary had handed in a written statement
to the secret service to the effect that a pupil of hers,
a Soviet employee, to whom she had been giving lessons
for many months during which he had behaved very
decently, had treated her to tea and pastry at the last
lesson. While she was eating, she: alleged, she felt dizzy.
“L” called the doctor who gave her a powder. After
taking the powder she felt slightlybetter and fell asleep.
During the night she was suddenly awakened by feeling
a weight on her body and sharp physical pain. When
she became thoroughly awake she realized that “L” was

trying_ to rape her, revealing in this the most sadistic
passion, for he bit her in no less than 15 places. After
a short sharp resistance she managed’ to free herself and
escape to another room. But “L” pursued her and the
struggle was resumed. Just as everything appeared to be
lost, she, so Mary stated, snatched up the salt cellar from
the tableland threw the salt in “L’s” eyes. Fearing that
this would enrage “L” still more and that he would pur-

l sue her, she ran out of the house and locked the front

and back doors. In proof of her statement Mary had
submitted a bunch of keys and a certiﬁcate signed by
Dr. “N” whom “L” called when Mary felt bad, testify-
ing that ‘‘L’’ had persuaded
him not to take Mary home
but to leave her at his lodgings.
The certiﬁcate also stated that
the next day Mary had visited
Dr. “N” in a very disturbed
condition and that on her
body he had found 15 bites
and bruises. i

“L” listened to the agent’s
story as if in a trance and
could not collect his thoughts.
One thing he began clearly
to understand and that was
that he was on the edge
of a precipice and entirely

He was struggling hard to
17

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
   
 
   
  
   
 
  

think of a way of escape, but he did not realize that the
only way was to go and tell his nearest friends, that any
other decision would be fatal. The plan of the secret
service was carefully drawn up. Its aim was psychologically
to present the effort to recruit “L” for their work not as
if they had instigated the whole affair and were trying
to blackmail him, but as if they were his saviors who
wanted to get him out of his trouble and therefore were
deserving of some “slight” service in return.

The agent said that the secret service did not want
to compromise “L” and create a scandal because he was
not an ordinary person but a responsible employee of a
country with which his government maintained normal
diplomatic relations. As, however, they had received
the complaint from Mary, they were obliged to report
it to the Public Prosecutor. They had already inter-
viewed Mary, he said, had questioned her and had sug-
gested that she raise no scandal about the matter, but
settle it quietly. Mary objected to this for a long time,
but, ﬁnally, pressed hard by the secret service, she agreed
.on the condition that she receive a sum equal to 5,000
gold rubles within five days. At ﬁrst “L” refused to hear
of this. Later he offered a smaller sum, but the agent
said that he was not authorized to carry on such nego-
tiations. .

A few days after, “L” met the agent and told him that
1 he had not the money and could not obtain it. Three
days after this a person met “L” by appointment and in-
troduced himself as the Assistant Chief of the Secret Ser-
 vice. He hinted to “L” that he was ready to help him
 18

 

obtain the money from a bank, but that he expected
“L” to compensate him for this service. The secret
service did not ask much; he said, they wanted peace
and order in the country, but they received many re_~
ports about people. Very often it was diﬂicult to decide
what was true and what was false, and, therefore, all they
asked was that  give them his opinion about certain
persons they were interested in.

“L” expected something very much worse: This re-
quest seemed to him to be a very innocent one. ‘He
even began to persuade himself that he was doing a good
thing because he would be able to save Soviet people
from slanderous attacks by the enemies of the Soviet
Union. One more step and “L” would have taken the
fatal path of betraying his country.

However, the enemy did not triumph. “L’s” comrades
noticed that he was behaving rather strangely. Then
they heard rumors about the breaking of the locks. They
noticed that “L” was avoiding his friends, disappeared
in the evenings and told lies in replies to questions. It
was also noticed that “L" was selling many of his things.
and was trying to borrow money. They decided to have
a comradely talk with him, and .at last he found the
courage to tell them all about it.

‘Me have deliberately told this story in such detail in
order to show how lack of vigilance--even in such a. seem»

honest citizen of unstained character like “L” into the '

clutches of the bitterest enemies of our country who, as
a rule, always start with a request for some slight service
in order later on to compel their victim to commit mur-
der, incendiarism and espionage.

A number of cases are known where the enemy, tak-
ing advantage of the dissoluteness of some Soviet citizens
who go ‘abroad ‘on business, introduce them to women
and then scompel them to give satisfaction to the “of-
fended husband” who appears on the scene; and as com-

pensation for not creating a scandal they compel the,

credulous and disso-
lute persons to act as
spies and betray their
country. This hap-
pened to a Soviet
citizen, who formerly
had had an irre-
proachable character,
who was on official business in Japan. He began to fre-
quent restaurants and other places of amusement and be-
came friendly with one of the frequenters of these places,
a rather gool-looking woman of “aristocratic appearance.”
During one of his meetings with this woman in a se-
cluded corner of a fashionable restaurant, a Japanese in
military uniform suddenly appeared and introduced him-
self as the “husband” of this woman and angrily de-
manded satisfaction for the insult to his honor and home.
There would have been a scandal had not a kindly look-

 

fingjapanese in civilian clothes appeared on the scene

20

 

 

and persuaded the military man not to create a scandal
and to settle the matter quietly. The Soviet citizen, feel-
ing that his position was desperate, clutched at this “con-
ciliator” as if he was an anchor of salvation. The matter
was settled “quietly,” but at what price? The Soviet
cit.izen gave the “conciliator” a written statement prom-
ising to give “information” about certain matters in the
U.S.S.R. in which the “conciliator,” who proved to be
an agent of the Japanese secret service, was interested.
But having given the written statement this Soviet citizen
found himself in the clutches of the “conciliator.” Fear-
ing that the “conciliator” would betray him he began
to become more and more entangled in the web of
espionage, and carried out one espionage commission
after another. He was converted into a Japanese spy
and an enemy of his Country. »

There was the case of a certain Soviet oﬂicial “N”,
who, while abroad on official business, fell into the
clutches of the secret service of that country under the
following circumstances. One day“N”s went to a cafe.
He had his briefcase with him, but it contained no busi-
ness documents. After having several cups of coffee he
went to the telephone, leaving his briefcase on the table.
When he returned to the table, he found the briefcase
where he had left it, and after sitting there a little while
longer got up to go. At the door of the cafe he was
accosted by a young man who asked himzi “Are you so-
and-so?’ “N” replied in the aﬂirmative. iThen he
young man asked “N” to step‘ to one side and said to
him: “You, Mr. ‘N,’ are a Soviet spy, violating the laws

21 i t

5,

of this country. The police do not know about this yet,
but you are entirely in my power. . I can save you if you
render me some service.” i

“N” angrily denied the accusation .but the young man
told him not to get excited, he could not get out of the
business for there were documents in his briefcase of an
espionage nature. Feeling sure that there could be no
incriminating documents in his briefcase, “N” immedi-
ately opened it to prove this; but to his horror, among
the other papers in the briefcase he found a document,
written in a foreign language bearing a secret mark,
which evidently had_been put there while he was at the
telephone. When “N” angrily accused the stranger of
having put the document into the briefcase the latter
replied: “Keep calm, Mr. ‘N.’ I do not know how you
are going to extricate yourself from this situation. I

. want to help you, but if you reject my offer-I.wi1l im-

\

    

mediately report you to the police.”
To cut a long story short, instead of immediately stop-

in this‘ conversation and, bein an honest man of un-
P 8 .

stained character, immediately reporting the matter to
the police himself, “N” began to seek for a compromise
with the stranger and at last, in order to “avoid a scan-
dal," agreed to obtain and pass on information about a
certain person living in the Soviet Union. But hav-
ing ensnared “N” in his web, the spy did not limit him-
self to this. He would not release “N” until he had
obtained from him a written conﬁrmation of his consent
to carryout this commission. As “N” did not see any
oth, L of escaping the‘ spy’s persecution, he com-
22

 

 

mitted the fatal mistake and gave the latter a written
undertaking to carry out his commission. And this writ-
ten obligation hung like a millstone around “N’s” neck
for the rest of his life. Using this written undertaking
and threatening to publish it, the agents of the fascist
secret service reached “N” wherever he went, and start-
ing from what at ﬁrst sight seemed an innocent commis-
sion, they “loaded” “N” withireal espionage work, com-
pelled him to betray his country and to become a con-
temptible, mercenary spy in the hands of the fascist secret
service. ‘

Cases are also known where spies have ensnared peo-
ple in their nets by taking advantage of their moral in-
stability while abroad. For example, a Soviet worker on a
commission in a foreign country made the acquaintance
in the course of his duties of a number of oﬂicials of for-
eign consulates. One of them, who presented himself
as a wealthy man, frequently invited this Soviet citizen,
whom we shall call “T,” to join him in various pleasures
such as going to the races, theatres, night clubs, cab-
arets “and similar places. This foreigner always insisted
on paying for these entertainments. Thus “T” began to
spend his spare time mostly with this generous acquaint-
ance, visited various expensive places of amusement and
was drawn into a life of pleasure.

But one ﬁne day the “benefactor” informed. “T” that
he was bankrupt and that his creditors were pressing for
immediate payment. He therefore asked “T” to recom-
pense him for all the expenses incurred during their
joint pleasures. When “T” heard the amoun T 

23

  

 

 

asked for he was astounded,
for he had never spent such
a sum in the foreigner’s com-
pany. The foreigner, how-
ever, insisted upon immediate
payment. Naturally, “T”
could not obtain such a sum
and so his boon companion
suggested a way of “saving” them both, namely, that “T”
give certain information of a minor character to a cer-
tain man of substance who could use this information
to great commercial advantage. When “T" refused, his
“friend” began to threaten that he would immediately
inform “T’s" chief about the immoral life he had been
leading, about their joint pleasures, and, incidentally,
about the secret information which, he said, “T” had al-
ready blurted out. “Would it not be better for you to
give this harmless information,” said the spy to “T,”
“than to risk your good name, and perhaps even your
life, and also the utter wreck of your family, for your
wife would never forgive your immoral conduct? Would
it not be better to let all that has occurred pass into
oblivion by giving my friend certain information
the divulging of which will not cause anybody any
harm?”

Not having the courage to tell his comrades of his rep-
rehensible conduct, of his association with hostile ele-
ments, and thus saving himself from sinking still lower,
‘_‘T” gave written consent to provide the information
asked gforoand in return obtained from his acquaintance

" ’=*~fl.”::,': 24

 

 

 

a worthless written undertaking not to demand‘ any
money from him and not to blackmail him. “T” ended
up by trying, on the demand of his new masters, to steal
a secret document, and was caught in the act.

A case is known-where the German Secret Service tried
to employ against a Soviet citizen, who had gone abroad
on oflicial business, the following clumsy method to re-
cruit him. On arrival the Soviet citizen looked for lodg-

dings. He inspected several places and ﬁnally decided to

take a room that was being let by an elderly woman.
During his conversation with the landlady a young wo-
man was present who introduced herself as the land-

lady's friend. ‘Having discussed the terms on which the _

room was to be let, the comrade referred to promised to
call within a day or two to settle the matter. When he
called he again met the landlady who asked him to wait
a little as she had to consult some relatives of hers who
lived next door before ﬁnally letting the room. The
comrade waited in the hall smoking a cigarette. A few

minutes later the landlady appeared, accompanied by a -

police inspector and a police sergeant. The" inspector
stated that the landlady had entered a complaint to the
effect that when the comrade had visited the apartment
on the first occasion he had "stolen two gold rings. As
nobody had visited the apartment either before or after
he had inspected the room, suspicion fell on him. The
inspector asked the comrade to go to the police station
-to draw up an oﬂicial report. The comrade protested
very strongly but without avail. He was obliged to go
to the ‘police station and there he was subjected to a

25

  

. humiliating examination, and they even tried to search
him. When the inspector realized that the search would be
strongly resisted he sudden’
8?’-a= ly adopted a friendly tone
ﬁfg. »/ and said that perhaps the
>)/ \ citizen was not guilty, but
there was evidence and he
// had to search him or else
draw up a report and sub-
C-P» mit the matter to the
L! S Prosecutor. Meanwhile he
would have to detain him.
As, however, he realized
what a scandalous matter
‘ this would be for him, he
was prepared for a small
,5 sum to “avoid unpleasant-
ness,” hush the matter up

, and let the “thief" go.
Unfortunately, the comrade, eager to get out of his
awkward position as quickly as possible, without think-
ing of the consequences, took out his wallet and, extract-
ing a 20-mark note, put it on the inspector's table. Just
at that moment the door opened and a genteel but
modestly dressed young man who, notwithstanding his
civilian clothes, bore all the marks of a military oﬂicer,
entered the room. He said that he was in the next room
and had heard the comrade offer the poliee inspector a
bribe. As the senior otlicer it was his duty to draw up a
report of this. After questioning the inspector about the

26

 

 

 

reasonsifor detaining the Soviet citizen, the officer stated
that the attempt to bribe the inspector was direct proof
of his guilt and ‘immediately demanded that a report
be drawn up stating that he had tried to secure his re-
lease by means of a bribe. At the same time he ordered
the Soviet citizen to be immediately taken into custody.
The report was drawn up, but the comrade refused to
sign it. The oﬁicer then sent the inspector out of the
room and when he had gone he informed the comrade
that he was an oﬂicer in the secret service having the
activities of the police under his observation. He fully
appreciated the scandal this incident would create, he
said, and expressed his readiness to assist the unfortunate
Soviet citizen. He could not do this, however, without
obtaining some service in return. He proposed there-
fore that the Soviet citizen obtain information for him
about another Soviet citizen then living in the Soviet-
Union. Our simpleton, not suspecting anything, wrote
the name and address of the person in question in his
note book and at the officer’s request wrote the same
name and address in Russian in the ofﬁcer’s notebook.
Then, thinking that he had got off quite lightly with the
help of the officer of the secret service, he left the police
station and went home.

On the way home our friend thought over what had
happened and wondered whether he should tell his com-
rades about it, but fearing that he would be laughed at
he decided not to tell anybody and tried to forget about
it. Two weeks later, however, he received a telephone
call at his house stating that the oflicer of the secret ser-

27

 

 

'5

vice desired to see him to discuss a matter which he
knew about. It was only after this that our simpleton
realized what was in the wind. He then decided imme-
diately to inform his chief about what had happened
and so saved himself from the fate which awaited him
if he had allowed himself to be drawn deeper into the
despicable farce arranged by the secret service.. When
the secret service agent began to press him and threaten
to expose him, our comrade told him in very sharp terms
that he had himself informed his chief and that an of-
ﬁcial protest would be made against the despicable spy-
ing methods which the secret service employed against
honest Soviet citizens. The secret service, however, did

not let the matter rest for a long time, desiring not to ‘

lose its intended prey, and tried to resort to intimidation.
But all their efforts were unavailing as a result of the
honest and straightforward conduct of the Soviet citizen.

The examples quoted above only slightly raise the cur- -

tain on the sordid and revolting methods erﬁployed by
foreign, and in particu-
lar, fascist secret services
to drag innocent people
into their espionage net.
Truthfulness, honesty
in relation to the Soviet
state, a sense of duty to
one’s country, vigilance,
conscientious fulﬁlment
of duties and self-control
should protect every So-
28

 

viet citizen against these despicable efforts of our enemies.

Resorting to the most sordid methods in their espion-
age work, the fascist secret service realize that the meth-
ods they employ can also be used by other bourgeois
secret services and can be adopted more or less against
themselves. In order to make their subjects to some
extent immune against these methods the fascists demon-
strate one cinema ﬁlm after another for the purpose
of familiarizing them with the methods employed by
foreign espionage agencies. Films such as Mata Hari
(a well-known German spy in Paris), Port Arthur,
Natasha and Traitor are widely popularized. The last-
mentioned ﬁlm illustrates the work of foreign spies in
Germany. Special emphasis is laid in this ﬁlm on a Ger-
man airman who was entangled in the spies’ net, but
was not scared by the false documents which were fab-
ricated to entrap him and had the courage to tell his
chief about the trouble he had got into. For this he was
publicly thanked in front of his regiment. On the other
hand, the fascists do all they can to idealize their own
spies and have published quantities of utterly false litera-
ture describing their exploits.

The object of’ all this is to dazzle people with the
“romance“ of spying. Most of these fascist “romancers”
are being trained for work in foreign countries. Their

E and acts of diversion
are tried weapons in the
arsenal of bourgeois gov-
ernments. These weapons are not only used in the strug-
gle against potential enemies, but also against so—called
friendly countries.

The enemies of the Soviet Union dolnot limit them-
selves to sending spies into the country and getting their
people into important centersgi they exert every effort to
recruit dubious and unstable citizens of the Soviet
Union for their espionage system. They strive to draw
them into their web of espionage, to push them onto the
path of betraying their country and for this purpose re-
sort to blackmail, bribery, deception and threats in order
to compel them to serve the enemies of the Soviet Union.
It must be borne in mind that the spy, diversionist and
wrecker is dangerous because, disguising himself as “our"

age organizations have at their command a powerful‘

organization which resorts to every legal and illegal
method of permeating the organism of neighboring coun-
tries. Notwithstanding the veil of secrecy which con-
ceals espionage operations, the World War, the post-war
period and the present pre-war period provide an abun-
dance of facts showing how widely espionage operations
are carried on. Espionage organizations spread their ten-
tacles around government oﬂices, large factories connected
with the work of defense, and the transport system, for
the purpose of discovering state secrets, sécrets connected
with defense and technical improvements, and for the
purpose of getting their people appointed to ‘important
posts to organize wrecking acts of diversion and treachery.

V Espionage is‘ continuous, concealed war, waged by armies
- of spies, and does not cease for a moment. This is shown

by the numerous trials behind closed doors which have
taken place recently in America, Great Britain, France,
Czechoslovakia, Rumania and Spain.

cause the deathiof numbers of Soviet citizens, to cause
disasters and facilitate the victory of our enemies.

In order to hinder the enemy in his work, to prevent
him from discovering our state secrets and from damag-
ing our defenses and socialist construction, we must thor-
oughly learn the lessons that have been recently taught
us, we must declare war against credulity and compla-A
cency which leave loopholes through which our enemies
can penetrate into our midst. We must expose the cun-
ning and devious paths by which foreign secret services
recruit for their espionage system people who are not
bad in themselves, who do not want to become traitors
to their country, but who become spies because they
lack vigilance and are unable to discern the enemy and
his despicable designs beneath the mask of friendship
and pretense. A

Foreign secret services strive by various means to send
their trained spies into other countries. These spies un-
dergo a very thorough training before they are sent on
espionage Work to the particular country in which the
secret service is interested.

During the X/Vorld War there was the well-known case
of the British agent “DN-27” who was trained at a
school for spies in Devonshire. He went to Germany long
before the war broke out, joined the army there as a
volunteer and soon after obtained a commission as a

lieutenant. Speaking German, English and French ﬂuent-
1y, he was transferred to the Headquarters Staff of Prince
Rupprecht of Bavaria who was in command of the
Bavarian Corps near Lille. During the whole period of the

/ ism of the state is practised by all foreign

war “DN-27” was in communication with
the British Intelligence Service. Even
in 1918, when the German Secret Service
had managed to secure a list of the A1-
lies’ secret service agents, this officer, who
at that time was already a colonel in
command of a German regiment, still re-
mained undiscovered. He revealed his
identity himself in Spa, where he was sent
as a German delegate for the armistice
negotiations and openly joined the Brit-
ishn delegation.

The sending of spies to other countries
for the purpose of permeating the organ-

secret services. At the same time they also

study the inhabitants of neighboring countries for the
purpose of singling out those who, under some pretence
or other, or by one method or another, can be recruited
for espionage work. It is well known that nearly all
persons who receive a permit to leave Germany are ob-
liged to present themselves to the Foreign Department

of the National-Socialist Party, and the overwhelming

majority of these receive instructions to conduct espion-
age work and also to study the people they come in con-
tact with abroad.

The same system prevails in Japan. The study of
citizens of foreign countries is pursued for one purpose
on1y—to recruit them for espionage work. For example,
before the World V/Var, the German Secret Service had

5

a special card index which recorded according toplace
of residence, occupation and description, all persons
marked down as possible recruits for their espionage
operations.*

These lists of “candidates” for espionage operations,
who very often are the victims of blackmail, are drawn.
up on various grounds. Primarily, of course, attention
is paid to politically unstable and wavering elements,
then to people suffering from various weaknesses and
vices, drunkards, per-
verts, people guilty of
mishandling govern-
ment money, embez-
zlers, etc.

Possessing these lists
of people who. are

 

compromised in one way or another, the secret service a

takes advantage of the visits to foreign countries any of
these people may make in order to recruit them for their
espionage work. The secret services also send out agents
to foreign countries to recruit agents from among the
inhabitants of those countries. Spies sent to the Soviet
Union undergo very careful training. They are taught
to speak the language perfectly, they are compelled to
read the Soviet press ofthe district to which they are

* Before the war the German Secret Service had a list of 47,000
persons living in Russia, Great Britain and France. These people
served as a reserve from which spies were recruited. To recruit them
for espionage work all sorts of methods of blackmail, bribery, threats
and provocation were resorted to, according to the character of the
individual concerned. ‘

to be sent, they are taught radio engineering, and dur-
ing their course of
training are obliged
to listen to broadcasts
from the Soviet
Union. pThe Polish
Secret Service, for ex-
ample, makes it ob-
ligatory for their spies
who are undergoing
training for opera-
tions in the U.S.S.R.
to read as “compul-
sory reading” special ,
“lists of recommended literature” which they must be
able to interpret in the spirit of Soviet criticism. These
lists include such books as Sholokhov’s The Soil Up-
tumed, Furmanov’s Chapayev, Panferov’s Brusski and
Ostrovsky’s How the Steel Was Tempered. Recently, Polish
spies have been obliged to study the new Soviet Constitu-
tion, the history of the’Communist Party and material on
the Stakhanov movement. They are expected to use So-
viet terminology with ease.

Trained in this way, the spy-recruiting agents are sent
to the U.S.S.R. as tourists or transit passengers, also they
cross the frontier illegally, for the purpose of recruiting
people for their espionage work.

Every spy sent to the Soviet Union from capitalist
countries tries to acclimatize himself to Soviet condi-

 

tions.as quickly as possible,“ to acquire the appearance

7

 

 

of a Soviet citizen and to obtain a situation. This is
made easier in the Soviet Union owing to the absence
of unemployment. The spy strives to get into a factory
or into a government office, to make acquaintances
there and watch carefully for likely recruits for his work‘.
To facilitate his task the spy obtains a false or stolen
passport, sometimes even a Communist Party book, and
all sorts of certiﬁcates and recommendations. He sticks
at nothing in order to become legalized. For example,
he looks out for a conﬁding woman, or a well-known
Stakhanov girl, the daughter of a worker of long stand-
ing, marries her, and so becomes well-known himself -in
the factory as “so-and-so’s husband,” or “so-and-so’s son-
in-law," etc. To disguise himself more thoroughly the
spy endeavors to distinguish"himself as an “active” work-
er in social life and as a Stakhanovite, or else resorts to
ﬂattery and toadying and even to frequent “marriages”
and “divorces" with the view to obtaining the most suit-
able “partner.”

Thus,‘ taking advantage of the relaxing or complete
absence of vigilance, the enemy penetrates our ranks and
becomes “one of ourselves.” Afterbecoming well estab-
lished in the factory or office the spy begins gradually to
develop his recruiting ‘work among our people in the
effort to transform them into traitors to their country
and to compel them to serve the foreign secret service.

As the recent trials of the Trotskyites, Zinovievites
and Right renegades have shown, these enemies of the
people quickly responded to the call of their masters
in the fascist camp and tried to work conscientiously on

8

 

 

 

behalf of Japanese-German fascism. The trial of the
Trotskyite-Japanese-German agents showed that these
despicable traitors, the Trotskyites, wreckers, spies and
diversionists, sought their masters among the fascist secret
service agents as eagerly as the latter sought for agents
in the ranks of the Trotskyites.
It is much more diﬂicult to recruit for espionage work
those who have nothing in common with the Trotskyite
‘ traitors. The fascist spies do
not ignore even honest peo-
ple and resort to the most
sordid methods to recruit
them for espionage work.
They get them mixed up in
sordid ﬁnancial and sexual
affairs and then resort to
V_ blackmail and intimidation.
If the spy does not ﬁnd people who fall ready vic-
tims to his snares because they are disgruntled, politically
unstable, weak—willed, loose-tongued or suffering from
various vices, he marks out his victims and artiﬁcially
cultivates in them the qualities he needs: a sense of
grievance, discontent, vices, and sometimes he deliber-
ately compromises them in the eyes of their friends.
Cases have been known of anti-Soviet literature being
sent to persons whom a foreign secret service had picked
out as potential recruits, and watch was kept to see how
they reacted to this. If the victim did not inform any-
body about the receipt of ‘this counter-revolutionary leaf-
let, either his Party Committee or the Soviet authorities,
