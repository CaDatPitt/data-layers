the right to enforce his rights against the Gov; ,

The State Depar-tment's repeated ﬂouting ; of _ a
this "rule of law” has contributedsubstantially, 3 ~- -
I in an ever-expanding circle of cause and effect, " '
to the general breakdown of civil liberties and 
of faith in -the fair dealing of the U.S. Govern-V j
rnent. ‘ " .
During the past decade a number of promi-
nent Amer-icans whose passports have been re-
voked or denied on political grounds have
fought back against the State Department.
oﬁten successfully, through the courts or by _

other means. These include Anne Bauer, free- 
I-ance writer ; Leonard B. Boudin, General if
Counsel of the Emergency Civil Liberties Corn-
mittee; J, Henry Carpenter, Presbyterian 
ister; Willimn L. Clark, jurist; Jerome Davis,
educator and sociologist; W. E. BC Du Bois,

The first signiﬁcant curb on the lawless con-
duct of the State Department occurred in July
1952 when a Federal District Court ruled -that

 the Passport authorities must give a formal
_ V hearing to Anne Bauer, whose passport had
' . suddenly been revoked after she attacked the

extreme racist policies of America's ally, the
South African Government. In supporting her
case, the American Civil Liberties Union as-
serted -th-at the Passport Division was an "island
of old-fashioned autocratic practice."

In delivering its opinion «the court said that

the ‘cancellation of Miss Bauer’s passport
“without notice and hearing before revocation, ’
as -,well. as refusal to renew such a passport ~
Without an opportunity to be heard, was,with-

V out authority of law. . . . This court is notwill-I

ing to subscribe to the view that the executive
power includes any absolute discretion which
may encroach on -the individu-al’s constitutional
rights, or that the Congress has power to con-

fer sudh absolute discretion. We hold that, like ' ii.

other cur-tailments of personal liberty for the‘

public good, the regulation of passports must
be administered, not arbitrarily or capriciously,
but fairly, applying the law equally to all citi-
zens without discrimination, and with due proc-
ess adapted to the exigencies of the situation."

 As a result of the Bauer decision, the State
Department in August 1952, announced the
establishment of a special Board of Passport

Appeals; and simultaneously enacted new regu-o 
lations that for the first time in the history of , J,ji1, ,
the United States, laid down political tests for ._  .

the obtaining of passports. ‘These regulations,
which are still in effect, deny -passports to three
classes of individuals: .

THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL

_ In the year 1215 King John of England,
yielding to his rebellious barons at Runny-

’ mede, signed Magna Carta and pledged there-

in: "It shall be lawful in future, unless in time
of war, -for anyone {to leave and return to

 our kingdom safely and securely by land -and

water. . .. . " Since this ﬁrst authoritative form-
ulation of the right to travel, there hasbeen a
growing recognition among ' civilized‘ nations

that all !PCfSOI'lS, except fugitives -from justice,

have -a natural right -to travel abroad.
Until very recently American citizens in gen-

- eral were free to leave the United States in '

‘ ‘peacetime as they chose. For approximately
a  150 years an American passport was consid-
_ ’ ered, as it should be today, merely a certiﬁca-
’ ..tion of identify and citizenship, a letter of

introduction to foreign nations for the purpose

*1‘ of facilitating travel. Prior to the First World
‘War only a handful of foreign governments‘

required visitors to -h-ave passports.

The Chinese situation again hit the headlines ‘

__ in the summer of 1957 when forty-two Ameri-L

can students attending a Youth Festival in

Moscow decided to ‘assert their independence is .
of bureaucratic red tape and to visit China. The g  ”
State Department issued a blast against them - 
and threatened «to cancel their passports when — T  "
they returned home; it even went to the ‘absurd , 
extreme of warning the students that‘ they S  i

might be prosecuted under the Tradingwith  — 
the Enemy Act, though obviously the United _ -_ V . 
States was not at war with China. The Ameri- ,

"can press as a whole again opposed the State A

De_partment’s*attitude; and in a lead editorial
the conservative New York Herald Tribune
called it a “blunder.” Later the State Depart-
ment softened itsppolicy -an_d_said that gthe stu-

‘A  " The---furor. over the students’ trip to China A_ 4
_ -apparently resulted’ in such heavy pressures on ;
' the State Department that it suddenly compro- s

mised on its travel policy and gave permission
to twenty-four American newsmen to visit the
Chinese mainland on an experimental basis for
seven months. At the same time the Depart-

- ment re-asserted in its release its right to con-

trol ‘travel to China and to limit drastically the

. number of reporters going there.

4.‘Walter Lippmann in the New "York Herald

~ Tribune had some harsh words to say about

. » this oﬂicial release which Secretary. Dulles had
V approved: "Mr, Dulles is making the claim
that outside the three-mile limit he may treat

and that the'American. press in foreign coun-

Secretary of State. . . . We~have here the un-
precedented and impertinent assertion that the
right to turn off and the right to turn on the

‘’ tary Dulles’s position that our people: should. —

means that they cannot obtain the facts neces-

" sary for an intelligent evaluation of American

foreign policy,

The sooner the American press and American
public opinion at large come to realize that the
constitutional right to travel is indivisible, the
better it will be for everyone —— no matter what
his profession or occupation — who wishes to

i" ‘go abroad, whether for business, for study, for

. art, for health, for sports or for any other law- ,

_ i ful reason. And the right to -travel grows more
- —  important year by year -as the number of Amer-

icans desiring to visit ‘distant lands steadily

_' increases. A -

.Besides the passport suits I have already
mentioned, there is now another case in the

" _ courts, the case of Lamont v. Dulles. It began -

because I myself would like very much to cross
the Atlantic again, to see old friends in Eng-
land, to re-visit old haunts on the Continent and

A ‘ to acquaint myself at ﬁrstahand with economic
_ _  and political developments among the peoples

‘ T for a renewal of my passport. Mrs. Shipley, ‘i

then ‘head of the Passport Division,* refused

 

my application, giving as an excuse the usual ‘

formula that "your travel abroad at this time

would be contrary to the best interests of the

United States.” ' . 
After a further exchange of correspondence,

1 sentjPresi‘dent Truman an Open Letter in

October 1951, asking him -to intervene on my

behalf. Although this was given considerable
attention in the press, the only reply that Ig'
received was ‘another note from the Passport ,

Division refusing me passport facilities. I was

never able to ﬁnd out the speciﬁc reasons for _ I In
the denial of a passport or to obtain a formal _ , , ,
hearing on the matter. However, I did get in- I

direct but deﬁnite word from Washington that
the Passport Division had relied upon a bulky
dossier concerning me and all my ideological

offenses over the pa-st twenty years, and that if _
I were really serious about wanting to go_ _
abroad I would have to change my "whole _.  '

_ In 1939 ‘the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a If f  ,
passport case in which the single issue was -» '
whether the applicant was a citizen of; the »
United States. But it has never rendered a de-_

oision on the right to travel as such and on the
constitutional issues discussed in this pamphlet.
Whether Briehl, Kent and I win or lose,_I_ be-

lieve that a Supreme Court decision _in our ‘ ’ 
cases will be helpful to State Departr'nent‘oﬂi- ‘

oials, the Judiciary -and the American people.

" Secretary Dulles himself has gone on record

(news conference of May 14, 1957) as favor-
ing a ‘Supreme Court -ruling‘ "as to just what

the functions and responsibilities of the Secre-Q

tary of State. are as regards passports. And

is I‘ V wzhdther or not it will be held that there is a
' right to travel everywhere which is superior to ‘
foreign .policy, I don't know. If the courts so V

   
 

-33”- M

 

i V decide, naturally, I will -accept such a decision." S

In a number of signiﬁcant decisions during

I’ H‘ 1957 the Supreme Court upheld the constitu-
-tional rights of the ’-individual against lawless
.; abuse by government authorities. I refer pa-r~

ticularly to the Konigsberg, Ienczéx, Sweezy,’
and Watkins opinions. The Konigsberg ruling

:9 * ‘is directly uappl-icaxble to the main pas-spout cases.

For there the Court stated that Koni~gslberg’s

.refusal to answer questions about possible

Communist Party membership and other poli-ti-

cal associations was not a sufficient reason for

the State Bar of California to exclude him and
thereby prevent him from -practicing law.
As I [have pointed Olllt, some of the Federal

S » . District and Alp-pea-ls courts have become quite

restive over the travel restrictions of the State

Departinent. In the Circuit Count of Appeals ‘

which ruled against 'Briehl and Kent the three

dissenting judges ﬁled vigorous opinions. Judge

‘ , David L. Bazelon was clear that “the President
' has not delegated to the Secretary of State dhe

‘ power to decide which Americans may travel

and which may not." Chief Judge Henry WM-te

‘ Edger-ton concurred with judge Bazelon and
, declared: "We have Itemporized too long with
the passport practices of the State Department.

-39;

‘_  ‘ travel is “regarded throughout -the -Twor

 in the fact that the United Nations Déclgrationl  
of Human Rights, signed by the United -States:_f i_
in 1948, aﬂirrns this basic principle in no~un- - 

centa-in. language. Article Thirteen ofthe Dec-

laration states: “Everyone has the right to---
leave any country, including ‘his own,‘ and ‘to

return to This country.”

In spite of -subscribing._ to .the U.N. Declara-s
' tion, ‘however, the United States Government
since «the ‘end of the Second"World War and 7 ~
the beginning of the Cold War‘ has widely

abridged the indivi-dua'l’s ‘freedom to .travel._' ‘ 

This it has done, not because large nu'mlbers.of'

crimninalsr are tryi-ng_wto «escape the courlltry, but

because ‘the US. State Department wishes to  '
penalize Americans who hold dissenting, opin-‘
ions and is concerned lest they criticize govern-_’

mental .-pol-.ic-ices while traveling abroad. A
Since _1947 :tihe_ State Department has been

 steadily undermini-ng liberties which Anglo‘-.   ' l
' ' . Saxons '-first won 742 years ago in Magna -Carta,
‘ It hastihus managed in «a brief ten years to set '

They can only go to a few countries in the A ”

Western Hemisphere, such as Mex-ico or ‘Can-.
zrda, where passports are not required for
Americans.’'‘‘ Thus the State Deparﬂmenrt has
curt-ailed not only the right to travel, but also
the right of ex-patriation, officially recognized

by Act of Congress in 1868. Again, the State‘

Department restrictions run counter -to the
U.N. Declaration of Hum-an Rights which

asserts in Article Four-teen: "Everyone has the‘
right to seek and enjoy in other countries “

asylum from persecution.” .

The State Department, which by statute is

assigned‘ the power to -issue passports, has
based its dictatorial policies on various Execu-V
tive Orders promulgated by Presidents of the
United States authorizing the Secretary of State
to draw up passport regulations and giving him

"discretion” over the issuance and use of pass-
ports. The Department, claiming that travel is
not a -right but merely a "pr-ivilege,” takes the
position that "discretion” -includes the author-
ity to refuse pass-ports to individuals because of
their ‘political views. The State Department
