A. B. C. OF SOCIALISM

(Declaration of Principles, Adopted by Cleveland Convention, 1924)

The Socialist Party is the party of the workers. It urges the workers to
take economic and political power away from the capitalist class, not to estab-
lish themselves as a new ruling class. but to abolish forever all class divisions
and class rule. ’

America today is not owned by the American people. Our so-called na-
tional wealth is not the wealth of the nation but of the privileged few. These
few are the rulers of America. They are few in number but they dominate the
lives of their fellow men. They own our jobs and determine our wages; they
control markets and fix prices; they own our homes and fix rents; they own our
food and set its cost; they own the press; they own the government and make
our laws; they own our schools and mould the people's minds. The Socialist
Party of the United States demands that the country and its socially useable

industrial wealth be redeemed from the control of private interests and turned .

over to the people to be administered for the benefit of all.

A The Socialist Party advocates the establishment of a system of co-
operative and publicly owned and managed warehouses, markets. and credits
to promote direct dealing between farmers and city consumers at the cost of the
service in their mutual interests. This will reduce the cost of living, will assure
to the farmers a proper compensation for their labor, and will enable them
to escape from the twin curses of tenantry and mortgaged serfdom.

The socialization of industry, as Socialists conceive it, means more than
is commonly understood in the term government ownership: it includes dem-
ocratic administration through the elected and responsible representatives of
the workers in the respective industries and of the workers as a whole.

The bulk of the American people are workers of hand and brain; men and
women who render useful service to the community in the countless ways of
modern civilization. They produce the nation's wealth but live in constant
dread of poverty. They feed and clothe the rich, yet bow to their alleged
superiority. They keep alive the industries, but have no voice in their manage-
ment. They constitute the majority and can right all these social wrongs
whenever they learn to use the power of their numbers.

The ruling class and their retainers cannot be expected to change the
iniquitous system of which they are the beneficiaries. The workers alone have
a direct and compelling interest in abolishing that system.

To do this the workers must be united in a political party and use it to
enact such measures as will immediately benefit the workers. raise their stand-
ard of life. increase their power, and stiffen their resistence to capitalist aggres-
sion; and ultimately to transfer to the people ownership of large scale industries,
beginning with those of a public character. such as banking, insurance. mining,
transportation, communication, and the trustified industries. and extending the
process as rapidly as conditions will permit. to the end that the exploitation
of labor through rent, interest, and profit may finally be abolished.

The workers of town and country must be strongly organized on economic
as well as on political lines. The ceaseless struggle of the labor unions and the
constructive work of cooperative societies are absolutely necessary. not only
for the immediate defense and betterment of the material and social condition
of the producing classes, but also to equip them with the knowledge and the ‘
habit of self-discipline which they must have in order to administer efficiently
the industries of which they are to win control.

It is the bounden duty of every Socialist wage-worker to be a loyal and
active member of the union of his industry or trade, and to strive with all his
power for the strengthening and solidification of the trade—-union movement.
It is the duty and the privilege of the Socialist Party and its press to aid the
unions in all their struggles for better wages, increased leisure, and better con-
ditions of employment.

The Socialist Party seeks to attain its end by orderly methods, and de-  ’

pends upon education and organization of the masses.

The Socialist Party stands for the mass of the American people. But its
interest is not limited to America alone. In modern civilization the destinies of
all nations are inextricably interwoven. No nation can be prosperous, happy,
and free while its neighbors are poor, miserable, and enslaved. The ties of in-
ternational solidarity are particularly vital among the workers. In all advanced
countries the working classes are engaged in an identical struggle for political
and economic freedom, and the success or failure of each is reflected upon
the fortunes of all. . 0

The Socialist Party is opposed to militarism, imperialism, and war.
Modern wars are caused by commercial and financial rivalries and intrigues of
capitalist interests in different countries. They are made by the ruling classes
and fought by the masses. They bring wealth and power to the privileged few
and suffering, death. and desolation to the many. They cripple the struggles of
the workers for political rights, material improvement and social justice, and
tend to sever the bonds of solidarity between them and their brothers in other
countries.

The Socialist movement is a world struggle in behalf of civilization. The
Socialist Party co-operates with similar parties in other countries, and extends
to them its full support in their struggles, confident that the workers all over the
world will eventually secure the powers of government, abolish the oppression
and chaos, the strife and bloodshed of international capitalism, and establish
a federation of Socialist republics, co-operating with each other for the benefit
of the human race, and for the maintenance of the peace of the world.
