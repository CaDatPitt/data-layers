salesmanship ‘and personal service will become increasingly mech-
anized year by year, and then where will they go?

While socialists do not claim that net unemployment is sure to
increase, they maintain that the only solution to the problem of
machine displacement is to socialize the machines. The trouble is
not with machines but with the way we use them. Because machines
are owned by a class, the surplus of the product of the machine
goes to that class. This produces such a maldistribution of the na-
tion’s income that the workers cannot buy back enough of their
products to keep the machines going. Socialism would take over, if
possible by purchase at a reduced price and if necessary by conﬁsca-
tion, all the great industries of the country, and operate them with~
out proﬁt as public corporations under a national planning board.
This would make possible a shorter work day and higher Wages. The
income of the nation would be put in the hands of workers rather
than manipulators and bankers.

We socialists believe in such a system even if capitalism does not
collapse in the near future. Capitalism collapsed morally long ago
and we are not willing to wait until all the capitalists admit the
failure of their own system. The system was a human failure even
in the days of so-called prosperity. We are opposed to any scheme
which will bring back the speculative orgies of 1928 and call those
orgies prosperity, because no society can be called truly prosperous
with millionaires on top and paupers on the bottom, especially when
the distance between millionaires and paupers is not based on merit.

2. The technocrats say that technicians could run our industrial
system better than the present masters of that system, and that if
they organized our national resources properly a two-hour day
would yield riches for everybody.

Socialists accept the second part of this statement with en-
thusiastic approval, even if they are sceptical concerning the techno-

» crats’ ﬁgures. Technocracy has not produced any proof that society

could maintain a high standard of living on a two-hour day, but

there can be no doubt that a four-hour day or a six-hour day might
attain that end if our national energy were properly organized and
controlled. Revolutionary prophets like Edward Bellamy and Karl
Marx long ago predicted a world of plenty if machines could be so
controlled that their products would be justly distributed.

Where socialists differ with technocrats is that they propose a
democratic control of industry by all brain and hand workers. They
honor the technicians for their skill, but they are not willing to trust
the control of industry to any one class. Technicians under capital-
ism have often been cold-blooded and self-seeking. Generally, they
have been unwilling to work for labor justice because of the pos-
sible danger of ruining their careers. Rarely do the great American
engineering societies speak out against low wages, long hours and
the denial _of the rights of manual workers. Most American engin-
eers, moreover, are surprisingly naive and uninformed about social
science and social reform. I believe therefore that in the industrial
system of the future the technician must be a subordinate part of a
larger industrial democracy.

We want a functional democracy—not a system of one-man-
one-vote democracy, but a system in which each group will partici-
pate in control. Under socialism the technician would be supreme
over the technical departments of industry, but the ultimate control
would be in the hands of three groups jointly, (1) the manual
workers, (2) the technicians and managers, and (3) the consumers
represented through the government. That is What we socialists
mean by industrial democracy. Under that system, of course, men
would be paid wages according to their experience and ability.

3. The technocrats are right in saying that our debt burden is
too large and that many of our debts will never be paid. I cannot find
however any ﬁgures to indicate that our internal debt is 218 billions
and that it takes half our national income to pay interest and amor-
tization upon it—not unless you count some of our obligations twice.
Probably it is fair to say, however, that half of our national income

.;-._.«_.-.:.=- _

would be used for interest and amortization on debt service if we
retired our bonds as quickly as they should be retired instead of post-
poning their retirement to distant generations. Probably it would
be fair also to say that one-fourth of our national income goes to the
debt service, even with the present system of debt retirement. This
is bad enough, and the full tragedy of that fact becomes apparent
when we note that debts are probably absorbing twice as much of
-our national income proportionately now as they did before the de-
pression. The wage-earners have taken their licking in appalling
wage cuts; the bondholders have not yet had their income cut pro-
portionately.

This condition is largely the result of the legalizing of the crazy
system of distributing wealth under private capitalism, as well as a
crazy system of debt pyramiding. When great fortunes are ac-
cumulated at the top of society, they are bound to be invested some-
where, and once they are invested, the men who do the useful work
of the world are expected to earn proﬁt, interest and rent upon those
investments. Those investments are protected by legal contracts
while the workers’ earnings are not. Socialists would reduce the debt
burden by income taxes, inheritance taxes, moratoriums on mort-
gages, a capital levy, by the nationalization of banking, and by t-he
socialization of great industries. They would inaugurate an entirely
different system for raising capital so that the burden of debt main-
tenance would be more evenly spread out.

4. The technocrats also say that the price system must go and
in its place an energy currency of some kind must be developed. If,
by the price system, they mean a system in which goods are exchanged
in terms of a common medium called money, I think that they are
wrong. Our money is not an evil in itself; it is made evil by two
facts. It is paid to people who do not earn it; and it ﬂuctuates in
value according to the amount of gold in the world. Since the amount
of gold in the world is itself a fluctuating thing, our dollar is un-
stable. Both of these evils would be eliminated under a socialist

12

I

system, which gave money only to those who earned it and which
adopted a currency adjusted to commodity values and national needs.
Such a currency has been described by economists as a “managed
currency.”

I think that the technocrats have given the world a considerable-
amount of mumbo-jumbo concerning energy units and their pos-
sible use in place of money. The fact that energy can be measured
in terms of ergs, joules, amperes, ohms and dynes does not prove that
the price system should be abolished. Gold also can be measured,
but that does not make it a good base for currency. The real problem
of the price system is to equate the unit of currency with a fair sys-
tem of reward for work. An opera singer might expend less energy
than a blacksmith, but the proof of that fact would not help us to
settle the question of a fair return for their respective services.

Under capitalism prices are often unjust and intolerable be-
cause they represent not so much the service of human beings as
the manipulations and special privileges of economic highwaymen.
When the technocrats attack the price system they ought to attack
the capitalist system, for it is private ownership and control of the
major sources of our wealth which makes the price system a horror
in America today.

The technocrats are extremely vague as to any system of energy
currency which they propose. Until they can show more clearly the
advantage of abolishing the price system I think we are justified in
believing in that system. The price system allows the consumer a
certain ﬂexibility of choice in buying products which he desires, and
this ﬂexibility of choice is a useful thing in any social order in
determining what goods should be produced and what should not.

Socialism has a method of social reconstruction ; technocracy has
not. Socialism has a complete economic plan for world reconstruc-
tion ; technocracy has not. We socialists say that the fundamental
cause of poverty and unemployment is that our economic life is a
feudalism controlled by one class, the capitalist class. We have or-

13

ganized a movement to wrest the control of industry from that class
and give it to society.

All history shows that a ruling class will not surrender its con-
trol voluntarily. It must be displaced by organized power. In facing
this fact the socialists are more realistic than the technocrats. The
technocrats do not seem to realize that the mere rightness of their 1*
ideas will avail nothing unless they have an organized movement be-
hind them. The socialist movement is capable of being such a move-
ment. It is still weak in America butits inﬂuence upon American
thought is growing amazingly. It is now the most important political 
movement in the world. It is capable of taking all the good that 
exists in technocracy and utilizing it in the building of a new social
order.

TECHNOCRACY AND SOCIALISM

By PAUL BLANSHARD

criticizing an opponent, said: “I feel like a man who is kicking
a swinging door.” That is how I feel about technocracy. The very
meaning of the word shifts from day to day. Now it is one thing

1N ONE of his campaign speeches years ago Lloyd George, in

and now another; now it has one leader, and then that leader is

ousted.

Technocracy as a word applies to both a set of ideas and a
group of men. For purposes of clarity I shall call the group of men
technocrats, and the ideas of those men and the logical inferences
to be drawn from them I shall call technocracy. The technocrats
became famous when they were engaged in making an energysurvey
of North America as guests of Columbia University. The group,
headed by Howard Scott, then split in two, with the major prophet
heading his own pilgrimage and Professor Walter Rautenstrauch
of Columbia leading a more solid and conservative brigade which
no longer claims the name of technocracy.

In spite of this split in the technocrats, however, it is fair to
deduce from their Writings and authorized and semi-authorized pub-
lic statements certain central doctrines which comprise technocracy.
Amid all the hokum, ballyhoo, and over-simplification, four ideas
stand out. i

1. Machines are displacing men so rapidly that unemployment
will reach 20,000,000 within two years. The output of manufac-
turing industry has gone steadily upward since 1918 and the num-
ber of workers steadily downward. Capitalism may soon reach an
impasse, and the whole system may collapse.

2. If technicians ran the American industrial system on an ef-

 

ficiency basis the average worker would need to work only two’

hours a day to produce a standard of living ﬁve times as high as
the average in 1929.

3. The debt burden of the United States is too great to pay, and
it never will be paid. The internal debt of the country alone (bonds,
mortgages, bank loans, etc.) totals 218 billion dollars, and would
absorb about half of the national income of 1928 in amortization
and interest charges if the debts were amortized at a fair rate.

4-. The price system must go and in its place a plan must be
developed for trading goods and services on the basis of some energy

determinant, possibly non-transferable tickets denoting energy ex-'

pended.

Of these four points some have been ﬂatly stated by Howard
Scott, Bassett Jones, and other leaders of technocracy, while some
are logical inferences drawn from the writings of the technocrats.

To back up their first and most important point the technocrats
marshalled a number of facts designed to give the public a notion
of the tremendous speed of machine progress in America. Many of
these alleged facts which startled the American public were exag-
gerated, and in the exchange of articles in the New York Times of
January 8 and January 2_2, 1933 between Simeon Strunsky and
Harold Ward many of the technocrats’ errors became evident. The
best modern straight-line brick production unit now in operation
produces bricks at the rate of 15,000 per man per day instead of
400,000, as some technocrats stated, and that includes only the
machine operators in the plant. The brick manufacturers claim that
the output per man per day in the factory does not now average more
than 4,000 bricks. The rayon factory in New Jersey which, accord-
ing to Howard Scott, could operate without a single worker on the
floor, will probably have about twenty workers. One man can pro-
duce at the most 550 times as many incandescent lamps as he could
in 1914- instead of 9,000 times as many, as one technocrat had it.

A The automobile that can run 300,000 miles without overhauling is

still in the ﬁeld of technical possibilities.

if

So much for the minor contradictions and misstatements for
which Howard Scott seems to be largely responsible. How much do
these miscellaneous mistakesidiscredit the central idea of technoc-
racy? I believe that they have only a slight effect. The overwhelm-
ing fact to which the technocrats bear witness is that the machine is
working miracles in our modern life. For every statistical error the
technocrats have produced concerning machine progress, a dozen
absolutely accurate statements of machine miracles can be mar-
shalled. The modified claims of the technocrats are in themselves
marvelous enough.

N 0 one disputes the fact that one automobile plant in Milwaukee
with 208 men can turn out 10,000 automobile chassis frames a
day, enough for the entire automobile industry of the United States.
The machines now in use in the cigarette industry often average
1600 cigarettes per minute per man as compared to a previous rate
of 600. Mr. Scott has not been contradicted in claiming that it took
1291 man—hours to produce a second-rate automobile in 1904, where-
as it took only 92 man—hours to produce a better car in 1929. Stuart
Chase has_ pointed out that we have developed engines that give
humanity almost a billion horsepower of energy, capable of per-
forming the work of ten billion men. Mr. Chase, in a brilliant
sentence in his pamphlet on Technocracy, has summarized the ac-
complishments of the new electric eye, which is symbolic of the
modern machine process. “The photo-electric cell,” he says, “which
never makes a mistake and never knows fatigue, has been introduced
to sort vegetables, fruits and eggs, to measure illumination, appraise
colors, classify minerals, count bills and throw out counterfeits, time
horse races, count people and vehicles, determine thickness of cloth,
see through fog, record smoke in tunnels, inspect tin cans, substitute
a new process for photo-engraving, direct traﬁic automatically, open
doors at the approach of a waitress, count sheets of paper and
measure their thickness, automatically control trains—to name only

i a few of its uses.” Regardless of arithmetical mistakes by the techno-

crats, we are in the grip of the machine age and it is changing our
life so rapidly that the effect is bewildering.

Meanwhile, although we have more mechanical genius than any
nation in the history of the world, and a greater store of natural
resources, the capitalist system appears to be approaching collapse.
We have at least 13,000,000 persons out of work, and other millions
only partly employed. Our farmers, if they are able to eat at all, do
not average as much a $10 a Week in income. Our men who work in
factories average less than $20 a week and our women about $13.
Our banks have enormous accumulated reserves of capital which
cannot be used because the owners of that capital will not farm it
out without security and an assured return. We have poverty in the
midst of plenty, while some men become poor by labor and others
rich by manipulation.

In such a crisis it behooves us to brush aside the minor errors in
the technocrats’ ﬁgures, and get down to the larger principles in-
volved.

Capitalism is crumbling. What shall we do about it? The tech-
nocrats have given birth to the four central -ideas which I have sum-
marized. Over against those ideas and as a supplement to them we
have the philosophy and the program of socialism. Let us compare
the central notions of socialism and technocracy.

The difference between socialism and technocracy is, ﬁrst of all,
the difference between a complete system of thought and a set of
stimulating but fragmentary ideas. Socialism is three things; a
critique of capitalism, a plan for social revolution, and a classless
society where collective ownership and democratic management of
industry exist. The socialist says that capitalism is breaking down

‘because it is an uncoordinated and unplanned system operated by one

class for private profit, and that the only way out is to organize the
entire productive system of the country into great public corpora-
tions controlled by a national planning board. Technocracy also is
a critique of capitalism, but it includes no thorough-going program

for overthrowing capitalism and no complete outline of the kind of
society which should succeed capitalism. The socialists have told the
world what they really stand for; the technocrats have only written
their first chapter.

Let us take the four central ideas of technocracy that I have
outlined, and look at them critically from the socialist point of view.

1. Machines are displacing men and capitalism is moving toward
a collapse as unemployment inevitably increases.

We socialists have emphasized the displacement of men by ma-
chines for a long time, although We do not pretend to know how
much of that displacement is permanent and absolute, and how much
is due to the cyclical depression of capitalism. Possibly this displace-
ment could be halted by certain modiﬁcations in capitalism such as
the shorter work day, but the recent tendency is startling, and there
is no proof that capitalism can ever reabsorb the 13,000,000 now
unemployed. During periods of so-called prosperity, the volume of
manufactured goods has increased at a far greater rate than the num-
ber of wage-earners. In the years 1901-13, before the war, while the
physical volume of production in manufacturing industries increased
at the rate of 3.9 per cent a year, the volume of employment in-
creased in these industries by 2.7 per cent each year. During the
post-war period, 1922-1929, while the annual growth in manufac-
tured goods was 4.5 per cent, that in volume of employment was
only 1.per cent.’

It is interesting to note how greatly the productivity of workers
has just recently advanced. The President’s committee on social
trends reported an increase in output per worker “of ﬁfty per cent

‘Dr. Frederick C. Mills, Recent Economic Tendencies, esp. pp. 249, 417.
N. Y.: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1932. In an average year,
from 1899 to 1914-, 1 man was inducted into the manufacturing industry
for every 7 on the payroll, while only 1 out of every 48 men employed
left the industry for which he was working. In an average year after the
war (1923-9) 1 man was brought in for every 22 on the payroll while the
withdrawal rate was as 1 to 20 (Ibid., pp. 421-2).

in the manufacturing industries since the beginning of the twentieth‘
century.” More than four-fifths of that increase came in the last
decade for which We have statistics, yet it was during that decade
that the number of manufacturing Workers fell steadily. A table
based upon the Handbook of Labor Statistics of the U. S. Depart-
ment of Labor for 1931 shows that the index number of productivity
per worker jumped from 1919 to 1927 in the steel industry from
100 to 155 ; in the rubber tire industry from 100 to 262; in the auto-
mobile industry from 100 to 146; and in the oil refining industry
from 100 to 187. This table, prepared by my associate, Henry J.
Rosner, shows the increase in productivity per worker in ten in-
dustries from 1919 to 1927:
Petro-

Iron Boots Meat leum Paper Cement Auto- Rubber Flour Cane
Steel Shoes Packing reﬁning pulp Manuf. mobiles Tires Milling Sugar

1919 — 100 ‘100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 10()
1027 — 155 115 128 187 134 152 146 262 167 160

In spite of this enormous increase in productivity, Which in most
industries was more than 50 per cent, the hours of labor were al-
most as long in 1929 as in 1919 in these industries, averaging about
fifty hours a week. And the Workers did not begin to get a fair
share of their increased productivity in the form of increased wages.
As Professor Mills of the National Bureau of Economic Research
again brings out, in the years 19_22—29, the volume of production
advanced by 3.8 per cent per annum, the amount invested in nevv
capital equipment by 6.4- per cent per year, the net income of all
corporations by 7.3 per cent a year, the dividend paymentsiof all
corporations by 12.8 per cent a year, and the proﬁts of ﬁnancial
institutions by 16.2 per cent a year. On the other hand, the average
earnings of employees in manufacturing establishments during that
period increased at an annual rate of only 1.6 per cent !’ Dividend
payments of all corporations increased during that period from

$3,4-37,000,000 to $8,356,000,000.‘ ‘

So the fruits of the machine were given chieﬂy to machine own-
ers, and this bad distribution of buying power had quite as much
to do with unemployment as the new and miraculous inventions.
Even if you grant that the investors are entitled to one-half of the
value of the increased production, in a year such as 1929, when
wages were at their peak, workers were cheated out of two billion
dollars a year in buying power. This two billion dollars equitably
distributed would go a long way toward keeping idle machines
running by creating a demand for their products.

I know that certain economists raise doubtsas to whetherthe
machine is permanently increasing unemployment. They point to
the fact that, although factory workers have decreased, the auxiliary
workers in manufacturing and the workers in personal service, sales-
manship and the professions have increased. But there is no proof
that this gain either balances technological unemployment ‘or ab-
sorbs the workers cast off by the factory system. Even an increase in
total employment in the nation does not necessarily prove that un-
employment is decreasing, because millions of new workers are com-
ing into the system and looking for work each year. Some of these
new workers were once in business for themselves and were forced
into the employed class by machine changes. Enough new workers
appeared on the American scene between 1920 and 1930 to increase
the gainfully employed by seven million. They found jobs, and it is
quite possible that they found the jobs which, according to theoreti-
cal economists, reabsorbed the men thrown out of work by the
machines.

Unfortunately, we have no good statistics on unemployment to
make conclusive reasoning possible. Thousands of the cast-off fac-
tory workers are unﬁtted for personal or auxiliary services; we can
see them walking the streets hopelessly even in times of so-called
prosperity. Even if some of them are absorbed into auxiliary occu-
pations, I do not foresee a bright future for them. The area of
