move -for a possible candidate.

can the Left Just Wait‘?

Under these conditions what must be the position V _ l

of the Left and progressive forces? Can they simply
wait, ﬁxed in their own, positions, u‘ntil matters
develop to their political satisfaction?

. If they simply, wait, matters will NEVER develop
to their satisfaction. No, they must participate in
all the movements of the people—at the level at
which they now exist and not at some artiﬁcial level
arbitrarily ﬁxed. They must soberly assess the real
situation, and constantly seek to advance the move-
ments in the direction of a people’s electoral coali-
t1on. "

It is, of course, the objective of the Left and
progressive forces to unite the people in a ﬁght

to meet their needs, to defeat Republican reaction a

and its Impellitteri and Tammany stooges. This
unity will develop _in a complicated process, a
process of struggle that unites many» people of
varied viewpoints. T

Labor and progressive forces can under today’s
conditions stimulate the development of a people’s
coalition. They can, if they work unitedly-, inﬂuence
political programs, candidates and the nature of
the coalition itself.

But the prime condition for inﬂuencing develop-
ments is working in the mainstream of the people
—where they are now. Above all, that means work-
ing in the main sections of organized labor,
A. F. of L. and CIO, and in the main Negro people’s
community organizations. A new electoral align-
ment will not develop without a change in the
attitude of the masses within these principal organi-
zations. This is an absolute pre-requisite for any
mass break-away movement from the two old party
machines. - '  ‘ ‘ ’

American Labor Party Contributions.

‘The role of a clear—cut third-party grouping like
the American Labor Party, which by its program
stimulates many of the current struggles, can be

extremely valuable in such a process. For many-

years the ALP has given yeoman service to the
independent voters of New York. It was the spark-
plug in Roosevelt and LaGuardia campaigns. In
1944, when the present Liberal Party leaders split
from the ALP, it was the ALP which held aloft
in New’ York the Roosevelt policies of winning

4 the war and building a durable peace based on

Big Three unity. In 1947 and 1948 the ALP boldly
challenged the bi-partisan pro-war policies of the

I _ Truman Administration and its Republican allies.

This makes understandable the tendency for some
progressives to see the ALP as the only vehicle for
third party expression. That narrow tendency still
remains a major danger,,along with the lesser—but
wrong——tendency to minimize the contributions of
the ALP in stimulating a new coalition movement.
If the ALP, while correctly putting forward itsown
independent position, will advance a consistent
united front policy in today’s struggles and a policy
of electoral coalition, its activities will be crowned
with success.

In this new situation progressives will have to
combat two wrong conceptions. First, because of
the deep mass opposition of the working people to
the Dewey gang—the local representatives of Eisen-
hower, Dulles and McCarthy——there will undoubt-
edly develop a tendency to tail uncritically after
any Democrat so long as he becomes verbally anti-
Dewey a la Impellitteri of late. This tendency is
obviously harmful to the people’s interests, since

much of the. nominal Democratic high command“

has, in practice, meekly accepted Dewey policy. In
fact, ﬁnance capital has generally ruled New York
by a neat bi-partisan division of labor——the Rocke-
feller-Chase National Republicans governing Al-
bany and their Democratic stooges at City Hall.

11

   

  

It is a.n'otorious' fact ‘that former Mayor O’Dwyer
and present Mayor Impellitteri had political al-
liances with Dewey; Both went along supinely with
the man from Albany who in turn, was—and is—.—
the front man for the~Rockefe1ler-Chase National
crowd. ‘ ' - ‘

A second wrong conception, increasingly virulent
of late years, is the go-it-alone tendency? in the pro-
gressive movement. This tendency has its roots in
the isolation of many progressives from the new
currents in the labor and people’s movement. This
tendency, for example, fails to see the enormous
political meaning of the new emerging unity
against McCarthyism cutting across existing party
lines.

‘This tendency sees only the diﬂiculties in obtain-
ing united action and fears_ only rebuffs from re-
formist leaders. This tendency sounds very “left.”
It sets advanced “conditions” for united action
(generally being that the other fellow accept in

toto the “left” platform). Actually, however, it ’

underestimates the willingness of the masses to ﬁght.
This tendency demands complete “left” or progres-
sive tickets if there is not complete agreement and
reciprocity from the very beginning of the whole
complicated process. This tendency is, obviously,
a self-isolating one.

But this go-it—alone tendency is by no means
conﬁned to the Left. The Liberal Party leadership,
dizzy with the success of the Rudolph Halley victory
in the 1951 Council presidency race, is also talking
of going it alone this Fall. Insofar as they reject
a c-oalition with the Dewey Republican machine,
as angrily pressed upon them by the New York
Times, the Liberals are right. They sense correctly
the deep anti-Dewey mood of the people of New
York.

ple’s coalition with organized labor, the Negro

people,.the progressivetand Left forces, they will A

only facilitate matters for-Dewey and the corrupt

. Democratic machine elements. Mr. Halley showed

some appreciation of-the deep feelings of the New
York workers by voting , against the transit fare

steal and the Dewey-Impellitteri city budget, al-.

though he weakened his position by his proposals
for certain service-reducing “economy” measures.
But he will be making a serious error if he rigidly
follows the narrow, exclusionary policy of certain
Liberal Party and Social-Democratic leaders. Their
long-time support of ’ibi—partisan7 pro-war 9 policies
has led them to an almost obsessive anti-coalition
policy, particularly directed against alliances with
the‘ progressive forces. LaGuardia during his life-

time constantl had to ﬁ ht a ainst their divisive
. Y g 8 A

policies.

Common political horse sense indicates the neces-
sity of a powerful electoral alliance of labor, the
Negro people, the mass of ‘D New Deal-minded voters
in the Democratic Party, and the Left forces of
the city. Given a‘ people's program such a coalition
—and only such a coalitio'n—can defeat both the
Chase Bank-Dewey crowd and the corrupt elements
of the Democratic machines. Such a coalition would
set- the pace for a tremendous defeat‘ of the Eisen-
hower-Dulles-Dewey-McCarthy crowd in the 1954
elections and speed a political realignment based
on labor.

Issues That Form the Basis for Unity

V-Vhat are some of the objectives for which New
York progressives should ﬁght in the 1953 elections?
These objectives, around many of which there
can'be the broadest unity, include:

1—An electoral coalition ticket broadly ‘repre-
sentative of the emerging popular currents. Council-
manic and judicial contests facilitate such coali-
tions. —’

2—Labor representation on the Board of Estimate

13

 
   

   

and in the City Council. The new struggles of labor
around civic issues indicate a new consciousness
on this question. Labor ‘has every reason to de-
mand one of the three top posts in the city as well
as a substantial bloc in the City Council.

3—Sharply increased representation of the Negro
people in all levels of government, with the special
target of smashing jimcrowism on the Board of
Estimate. (The announcement of Rep. Adam Clay-
ton Powell that he is receptive to a Democratic
nomination for high city office and the increasing
demand for a Negro candidate for Borough Presi-
dent of Manhattan reﬂect the growing feeling about
this question. The ALP, by its nomination of
Ewart Guinier, ﬁghting Negro trade union leader,
in 1949 and by its support of State Senator ]ulius
Archibald in 1952, laid the basis for forcing the
major parties to nominate a Negro leader for the
Board of Estimate this year.) ‘

4—Defeat of reactionary councilmanic and other

candidates in the Sept. 15 primaries. The active
intervention by the labor forces in the Fall prim-
aries is absolutely essential for the development of
any realignment. This whole problem deserves
prompt action by New York labor and progressives.

5—An adequate ﬁscal program for New York
City which would include the retention of the
1o-cent fare, a raise for civil service workers and
the expansion of basic city services—schools, hospi-
tals, health, child care, etc. That requires special
mass attention to the forthcoming special session
of the Legislature.

6—Wiping out of police brutality, with severe
penal action against those who practice or en-
courage it.

7-Abolition of discrimination in housing, private
and public.

8—A wide low-rent housing program and a re-

newed struggle against the recent 15 percent rent
increase. -

14

 

5-‘:
O .. EHC3 (5 A (‘ (n A _‘ hh

 

 

 

9-—A ruthless struggle against corruption, begin-

ning with a_ clean-up of New York’s waterfront_

with the indictment of shipowners, crooked labor
leaders and racketeers. This should be seen as no

substitute for—’-but an encouragement of—the de-

velopment of trade union democracy in the water-
front unions whereby the rank-and-ﬁle can guaran-
tee the effectiveness of the clean—up measures.

1o—A return to proportional representation
whereby labor and minority parties can be repre-
sented in the city government. Throughout the
city’s history it has been demonstrated that only
when labor and the minority parties were repre-
sented were the people’s needs most effectively ad-
vanced and corruption best fought.

Peace and the City Campaign

The objectives listed above represent those which,
in our opinion, can serve as the basis—in whole or
in part—for uniting many New York voters, espe-
cially working people. Struggle around these issues
reﬂects only indirectly the struggle around the
issue of issues—peace—which is, in one form or

another, constantly in the minds of our people.-

Can the issue of peace be brought directly into
a municipal campaign? Yes, it can and must.

The left and progressive forces who have fought
for peace since the cold war began must continue
that ﬁght within the framework of a municipal
campaign. Without making their position in any
sectarian way the pre-condition for unity with
various other forces, thereare an inﬁnite variety
of ways in which peace issues can be put forward
concretely by progressives. '

For example, New York, as the greatest port in
our country, is vitally interested in the question of
foreign trade. The perspective of ending the war
in Korea and thawing out the cold war generally
opens up the possibility for substantial East-West
trade ‘with its consequent beneﬁts to New York.

15

‘Sections of New York workers and rmiddlev iclassi 

people, other than those associated wﬁh the water-

front are likewise deeply interested in the possibilif*~‘_

ties of peace-time construction.

.-em,

Furthermore, the perspective of ending the 
Korean war and resolving other grave problems A"
by negotiations has notsonly evoked great hopes.‘ It i _
has also already raised in many minds the spectre of 2. 

a “peace” depression. While this fear of a recession
has man as ects, it does shar en the demand for
Y. P P
peace-time construction of all sorts. It will demolish
in the minds of millions the ar ument that the
8

bulk of our steel, lumber and other building materi- .

als are required for so-called defense purposes.

The Communists Fight for Unity

As for the Communist Party, it will continue to
ﬁght for the unity of the people of New York

against reaction. It will also ﬁnd the form in which ,

to participate independently in this campaign. It
will continue to advance as the main question be-
fore the people of our city the ﬁght for peace,
democracy and security. ’ A

It is secure in the conﬁdence that a united Ameri-
can people, with labor at its head, can prevent war
and fascism and can elect in time a people’s front
government that will advance the people to the
point where they will take the American road
to Socialism. <

These are turbulent times in which the people
can make history by intervening actively in public
affairs. With the growing mood of struggle for
peace and against McCarthyism, there is no room
for passivity or pessimism on the part of proges-
saves?

The Communist Party is conﬁdent that the work-
ing people of New York, if allied with the Negro
people and the masses of small business and profes-
sional people, can make great contributions this
fall in the struggle for peace and democracy.

Of all elections since the Eisenhower victory last
year, the upcoming New York City 1953 municipal
campaign is easily the most important. What occurs
in this city, center of ﬁnance capital, with its

powerful labor and progressive movement and its
"great electorate, is fraught with deep meaning for

1954-

It obviously behooves progressives, therefore, to
take a long look at the simmering New York politi-
cal potiand estimate soberly the forces at work
and the job ahead.

Political events in New York are developing not
only on the background. of the “usual” jungle-
like big city politics. They develop, above all, on
the background of the 1952 national victory of
the preferred party of ﬁnance capital—the Republi-
can Party. Direct Republican reaction seeks to
make new advances. A

Finance capital and its governmental agents
are increasingly seeking to throw new economic
burdens on the masses of the people. Recent weeks
have seen a direct effort by Gov. Dewey's Admini-
stration—aided and abetted, in fact, by the “Demo—
crat” Mayor Impellitteri—to lower the standard
of living of New York’s masses by a rent raise, a
fare boost, and a payroll tax. That they have not
completely succeeded in all these is due primarily
to mass resistance.

Dewey-Impy Attacks Resisted

These attacks on the living standards of New
Yorkers are reﬂected in the Mayor’s budget of $1.5
billions. While presumably drafted in New York,
the city budget is effectively controlled by Albany

3

 

 

legislation. Thus, the Republican State Administra-
tion, in connivance with the stooge-like Mayor,
forced into the new budget a continuation of the
three percent sales tax, along with a fare boost.
(The 15 percent rent increase had already been
decreed by the Republican-controlled Legislature).

These arrogant attacks on the people of New
York are a direct product of the 1952*, Eisenhower
victory. The stepped-up assaults on hard-won labor
and social gains in Washington are reflected in
similar attacks in New York. Along with these
attacks, the GOP is ringing the changes on crime
and corruption uncovered in Democratic New York
City, meanwhile discreetly seeking to screen from
public view. the organic relations of the underworld
with leading ﬁgures in the Republican Party.

But while the arrogance of ﬁnance capital_ and
its preferred Republican agents has increased, mass
resistance to attacks on popular living standards
has likewise mounted. The rent boost was opposed
by organized labor, the Liberal Party, the American
Labor Party, the Communist Party, Americans
for Democratic Action, virtually all the Democratic
minority in the Legislature, and even a few Re-
publicans. In New York City public pressure forced
Mayor Impellitteri and the Boardof Estimate to
retreat on the payroll tax. The Mayor was also
forced to reverse the proposal to wipe out day—care
centers for the children of working mothers. And
on the Transit Authority, with its built-in fare
boost gimmick, the ranks of the Board of Estimate
have been split, with City Council President Ru-
dolph I-Ialley and Manhattan Borough President
Robert F. l/Vagner already in the opposition, and
Comptroller Lazarus Joseph publicly wavering.

Most dramatic has been the visible growth of
unity in the ranks of organized labor, particularly
the civil service employes, as reﬂected in a new
militancy at the budget hearings. The great demon-
stration of C10 Transport Workers Union mem-
bers outside City Hall and the unity of A. F. of L.
and CIO leaders at the budget hearings reﬂected

new pressures‘ for united action. These actions by
labor are clearly the ﬁrst steps that life will compel
these workers to take on the road to independent
political action.

Dewey Trying to Take Over

All this makes for new possibilities for electoral
coalitions growing out of the present struggles and
battles looming ahead} These possibilities are sharp-
ened by the titanic events throughout the world.
Masses of Americans sense that with the powerful
initiative for peace undertaken by the peace
camp, there is the perspective of settling the war
in Korea and opening the road to a durable peace.
There is a new feeling about regaining lost ground
in construction of schools, housing, hospitals, etc.
There is——and will continue. to be—an increasing
demand for funds for civic improvements and a
lowering of mass tax burdens.

Labor is paying increased attention to legislative

issues. The always politically sensitive civil service

labor organizations have obtained almost unprece-
dented support of their respective federations. Na-
tionally, labor is giving considerable, thought to a
program of peacetime construction, as witness
A. F. of L. president George Meany’s speech in
New York April 25.

Apart from labor’s new political awareness, there
is unusual activity in and around a host of inde-
pendent committees reacting to the deep mass re-
sentment against corruption in government. While
some of these committees include well-known
middle class reformers and other well—meaning
citizens, they are generally controlled by Republi-
can-connected Big Business ﬁgures. They form
an essential element of the Dewey strategy of
capturing New York City preparatory to his 1954
gubernatorial ﬁght. '

Clearly, therefore,’ the main danger in this ex-

tremely fluid election is the attempt of the Chase

5

 

 

National Bank.-Republican gang directly taking
over the New City government. Their plan is to
do this under the facade of a Fusion coalition, or,

secondarily and only if otherwise impossible,

through some nominal Democratic stooge like
Mayor Impellitteri.

The Republican crowd now shouting for Fusion
invokes the name and tradition of.‘ Fiorello La-
Guardia. The situation does, in fact, faintly re-
semble the political picture of 20 years ,ago when
LaGuardia was elected Mayor on a Republican-
Fusion ticket.

The LaGuardia ‘Coalition

LaGuardia won with a curious coalition of weal- 4

thy good government forces allied with the leaders
of the garment unions. The Democratic Party was
split between the “regular” organization which

ran John F.‘O’Brien and the so-ca-lled Recovery

Party which ran Joseph V. McKee. It was a period
of intense mass struggle, particularly of the unem-
ployed, and the campaign followed close upon the
heels of the famous Seabury inquiry which drove
many Tammany oﬂice-holders to cover and Jimmy
Mlalker out of City Hall. It also followed the notori-
ous Bankers’.Agreement of 1932, whereby Winthrop
Aldrich of the Chase National Bank and Charles
Mitchell of the ‘National City Bank dictated ﬁscal
conditions to t.he_city for the ‘next decade.

It was also a period of deep anti—Nazi movements
among the masses of New Yorkers, movements with
which LaGuardia associated himself. It was under
these circumstances that LaGuardia, who had been
badly beaten by V/Valker in 1929, won with' a
minority of the total vote as a Repub1ican—Fusion
candidate. ' R

In 1933 LaGuardia was opposed by sections of
A. F. of L. labor and was viewed skeptically by
Communist and Socialist voters, who supported
their own mayoralty candidates. They were pro-
perly critical of certain of the Republican—Big Busi-

6

 

 

ness elements backing LaGuardia. But a signiﬁcant
realignment began to develop both inside and out-
side the LaGuardia camp between the 1933 and

.the 1937 elections. Labor began to organize the

unorganized and began to move aggressively into
independent political action.

Along with the formation of the CIO there was
developed bytjohn L. Lewis Labor’s Non-Partisan
League. In New York the American Labor Party
was formed in 1936 by a group of garment, men’s
clothing and millinery workers’ union leaders with
some support from Roosevelt Administration circles.
Under this impact, LaGuardia cut loose from most
of his Republican ties, supported Roosevelt and
associated himself ever more closely with the labor-
New Deal coalition. As a result, in 1937, LaGuardia
received the support of A; F. of L. and C10. The
ALP took the initiative in renominating him,
virtually forcing him on the Republican slate.

‘ The Communist Party, while not giving unqualiﬁed

support to the LaGuardia ticket, nevertheless with-
drew its slate in order to assist the coalition to de-
feat the reactionary Tammany candidates.

Thus, what began in 1933 as a partial coalition

Awithottt the Left emerged as a more or less de-

veloped electoral coalition in 1937. But not without
a process of sharp struggle.

Left and labor forces sharply fought LaGuardia
in the ﬁrst years of his administration on the sales
tax, on home relief and on other issues. Progressives

‘felt that on these issues LaGuardia was making

concessions to the Republican business elements
‘who supported him in 1933. It was only in‘ the

course of struggle on local and national issues that .

outlines of the 1937 electoral coalition began to
emerge and labor began. to play a more decisive
role in the LaGuardia coalition.

Fusion—-Then and Now '

But what differentiated the LaGuardia coalition

movements of 1933 and 1937 from the present '

7

  

  

Dewey-manipulated.Fusion movements were three
things:

1) The coalition and LaGuardia were moving
away from and not towards the reactionary Hoover
national policies and the Tammany local policies.

The present Fusion lineup is intimately associated. -

with the Eisenhower—Dewey policies of rent and
fare increases. it

2) Labor played some role in the 1933 LaGuardia
coalition, although a small one, and was decisive
in the 1937 electoralsituation. The bulk of organ-
ized labor is today hostile to the Dewey-dominated
Fusion movement.

3) Red-baiting played little or no role in the
LaGuardia coalition movements. In fact, it was
the Democratic ‘candidate in 1937, Jeremiah T‘.
Mahoney, who. made red-baiting a principal issue.
Today many of those in the Fusion coalition move-
ment make red-baiting a cardinal element of their
policies.

Despite its differences from the present situation,
the LaGuardia coalition period nevertheless holds
important lessons for progressives today.

The main lesson is that coalitions arise from
struggle and that the powerful labor and progres-
sive forces of New York, if united, can shape such
coalitions.

The Background for Coalition

VVhat are the.basic elements that form the back-
ground for such movements today? They include:

1. The growing ferment arising out of the desire
for peace and growing opposition to the conse-
quences of a war economy.

This was most clearly reﬂected in the great three-
day hearings on the city budget, as well as the mass
opposition at Albany tovthe 15 percent rent steal.
It is labor in the ﬁrst instance which feels the
weight of the Eisenhower-Dulles-Dewey program

8

 

 

and which is leading the resistance to the new eco-

. nomic burdens.

Q-  ‘

i2.’ The growing struggle on the civil liberties
front. . _’ _ ~

This is seen by the overwhelming anti—McCarthy
feeling in the city and the_ growing—although in-
sufficiently organized-opposition to such develop-
ments as the McCar_thy attack on freedom of the
press through his inquisitions of editor James
Wechsler of the N. Y. Post and the editors of the
‘National Guardian, ruthless ﬁrings of progressive
teachers, the police ban on the May Day parade,
the Velde inquisition, etc. Sen. Herbert Lehman's
remarkable speech urging a national attack on
McCarthyism undoubtedly expresses the majority
feeling in New York.

3. The widespread opposition to police brutality,
particularly as it is demonstrated against the Negro
and Puerto Rican peoples.‘

The opposition to the racist brutality of. the
police merges with the great opposition to discrimi-
nation in housing‘ and the powerful demand of
the Negro and Puerto Rican peoplesfor representa-
tion in all levels of government.

4. The mass revulsion to corruption in govern-
ment and the links of Big Business, Big Politics and
Big Crime. . 1

The old party politicians seek to utilize this
feeling—without, however, revealing the basic con-
nections between the Wall~ Street upperworld and
the racketeering underworld. The sensational State
Crime Commission hearings will be followed up by
a special session of -the Legislature convoked by
Gov. Dewey, precisely to focus pre-election‘ atten-
tion On the issue and thus advance Republican
fortunes in hitherto Democratic New York City.
Meanwhile, New York County District Attorney
Frank Hogan has taken what is for -New York
an unprecedented step, indicting Longshore Union
