clined towards the right or the left; and he
stares at it good and long; for he beholds some-
thing that none ever saw since first the Heav-
ens and the Earth knew creation. . ..

“Why such hesitancy?” demands the Chief
Justice. And the usher mutters:

“But one moment! The index is exactly inv.
the center. The Evil deeds and the Good are
exactly of the same weight.”

“Is that absolutely so?-” queries a voice from
about the table.

The usher looks yet again: “Yea even to a
hair’s breadth.” -

The Heavenly Tribunal holds its consultation
and the decision as to the sentence is thus pro-
nounced: “Since the Evil deeds do not weigh
more than the good———the soul, of course, is
free from Hell. But, on the other hand, since
the Good deeds do not prevail over the Evil——
neither can Paradise receive her.* Therefore
she is to be neither here, nor there, but a
wanderer between the realms of Heaven and
Earth, until the Lord have mercy upon her and
in His goodness call her unto him.” I

And the usher of the courts leads the soul 1
away. I
She sobs, and bemoans her fate. }
“Why art thou weeping?” he asks her. “ ’Tis ' i *
true thou wilt not know the joy and the glad-
ness of Eden, but neither will the agonies and
pangs of Hell be thine.” i

But the soul, unconsoled, replies:

“The Worst agony is preferable to nothing at
all. Nothing is most dreadful. . . ." .

And the heavenly usher pities her and offers
her some advice. .

“Fly downward little soul, and hover about
the living world of men. Gaze not unto heaven.
For what canst thou see on the other side, but
the little stars. Radiant little people—they cer-
tainly are, but alas, very cold. They know no
pity. They’ll never speak to the Lord about
you. Only the pious souls of Paradise will go
to such trouble for a poor, exiled soul....but
they... .hearken unto me. . . .they do love gifts,
fair and beautiful gifts.”

 The usher talked bitterly." “Such are the
E ways of Paradise; nowadays. Fly downward,
 then, to the living world and watch life there
 and its course. And if thou only catchest a
glimpse of something that is surpassingly fair
or good, seize thou it, and fly up to heaven.
Present it as a gift to the pious there. Knock
at the little window and in my name, speak to
the angel-guard. And when thou wilt have
brought three gifts—why then be certain that —

‘the gates of Heaven will be unbarred....they
I will manage to have it so for thee....At the
1 Throne of Honor, the well-born are not loved
= . . . .but the well-grown. . . .”
% And in this wise, and with compassion, he

 thrusts her out of Paradise.

 
 

II. THE FIRST GIFT

The poor little soul flies downward to the
world of the living in search of gifts for the
pious people of Heaven. It hovers about, every-
where; about the villages and the towns, about

' every habitation of man, amid the burning rays

of hottest summer; amid the drops and water
spears of rainy autumn; amid the silver web,

. fantastical, in the last days of summer; amid

the snowflakes that fall from above. . . .It gazes
about and about till it well-nigh spends its
sight.

Wherever and whenever it spies a Jew it
runs hastily up to him and looks at him in-
tently—perhaps he is on his way to Prayer-
to bless the name of the Lord. Wherever a
light breaks through the Chink of a shutter»-
she is there, to peep inside, to see whether the
Lord’s fragrant flowerets, the secret deeds of
good, blossom in that silent house. Alas!....
most of the time it must dart away from the
window in agony and dismay. . ..

And thus season follows season, and year
follows year. Oft, the soul becomes moody and
sullen. Cities turn _iuto graveyards, the grave-
yards into fields of pasture; forests are felled.
The pebbles of the brook become sand; rivers
have changed their courses; myriads of stars
have fallen and myriads- of souls have flown
upward; but the gracious Lord has never
thought of her; neither has she found aught
that was beautiful or good.

And she thinks within herself: “How poor
the whole world is. Its people—how mediocre;
their souls——how dark and obscure. . . .How can
aught good be found here? Alas! I must rove
about—an exile, forever."

But suddenly a red flame bursts before her.
Out of the dark-and gloomy night a red flame
leaps forth. She stares about her... .’Tis from
an upper window of a. house that the flame has

shot forth. Robbers are attacking a wealthy
man. Masks are on their faces. One holds a
burning torch in his hands; another holds a
blazing knife at the man's breast and repeats
his threat again and again:

“Jew, make but the slightest motion and you
are dead. The knife will most assuredly pass
through your back, then.” The others are all
busy, opening chests and drawers. The man
looks serenely about him, although the knife
is at his breast. The brows above ‘his lucid
eyes do not quiver. Not a hair of that gray
heard that reaches to the ‘waist moves. All
of it seems _to be something that is not his
concern. “The Lord hath given, the Lord tak-
eth. away,” he muses, and his pale lips mutter:
“Blessed be the name of the Lord.”

“On_e is not born thus and one may not carry
it all to his grave.” He views them calmly
when they are about to clear the last drawer
of the last bureau and watches, in absolute
silence, the pillage of the gold and the silver,
the jewelry and other precious things!

Perhaps he is renouncing it all!

But all at once——as the robbers are about to
lay hold upon the last hidden treasure—a little
sack, hidden in the most secret nook of all——-
he forgets himself—trembles all over, his eyes
are bloodshot, and he stretches his right hand
forward, to the weapon. He would, as it seems,
cry out! ' »

“Touch it not!”

But the cry is unuttered. A red, vaporous
stream of blood shoots forth, the knife has done
its Work....It is the 1;e.>art’§ blood. that be-

sprinkles the little sack. He falls to the ground.
The robbers tear the little sack open in a hurry.
That will be the best—the most precious gain
of all!

But what a grievous error! The blood had
been shed in vain——neither silver, nor gold, nor
jewels were there. Naught of any value in
this world. It was a little measure of sand
from the Holy Land, to be strewn on his face
ateburial. That, the wealthy man had wished
to save from the hands and gaze of strangers.
That had shed his blood... .and the soul seizes
a blood-soiled particle of the sand and knocks
at the little window of Heaven. Her first gift
found ready acceptance.

III. THE SECOND GIFT

“Remember now,” said the angel as he bar-
red the window. “Remember—-two more of-
ferings.”

“The Lord will aid me”—thinks the soul,
grown hopeful; and joyously flies down again.
However, her gladness lasts but a little while.
Again, years follow years and she can find
nothing that is surpassingly beautiful. And
her melancholy returns to her. “The world
has, it seems, forsaken the way of the Lord,
and like a spring ever runs out and out, The
more the water that flows into the soil, the
more sucked in—the more the soil becomes foul
and unclean. Fewer are the gifts for heaven
then. Men become ever petty and more petty.
Their good deeds grow tiny; their evil deeds
blacker and blacker dust——their deeds are hard-
ly visible to the eye!....”

 

YIDDISI-I SHORT STORIES . 13

And thus speaking to herself she seems to
think that should the Lord command all the

evil deeds and the good of the world to be ~

weighed in the Balance, that the needle would
hardly move, yea, not even tremble. The earth
can hardly rise or fall now, she is but a wan-
derer from the empyrean above to the black
abyss of Sheol below. A splendid cause for an
eternal disputation between the spirits of good
and of evil; just such a one as the eternal dis-
pate between darkness and light, heat and
cold, life and death....

The earth rocks to and fro. She can neither
ascend nor descend.- "Thus we ever have wed-
dings ancl divorces, parties and funerals, love
and hate—ever, forever. .

Suddenly the blare of trumpets and of horns
resounds. The soul looks down—and beholds
an ancient German town. All sorts of roofs,
narrow and bent surround the courthouse. A
motley crowd fills the place. People peer out
of the windows; others throng the roofs, and
some sit astride the beams at the edge, where
they are propped up by the wall. _,

A table, covered with a green cloth stands
at the head of the court-hall. The cloth has
golden tassels and fringes. The men of the
court are held with golden hooks. They wear
sable caps" and large feathers stick from the
shining buttons to which\ they are sewed. At
the head of the table, the President of the
court is seated. An Eagle hovers overhead... .

A young Jewess, all bound, stands on one_

side. Ten slaves /hold a white horse firmly
near her. Tgg president has risen and with

his eyes towards the market-place, he reads
the paper he has in his hand——her sentence.

“This Jewess,” he says, “is guilty of a mon-
strous sin. Even the Lord, in his gracious-
ness and great mercy,_could not forgive her
that. . . . .

“On our last and most sacred holiday, she‘
*slunk out of her ghetto and walked through the

clean streets of our town. . . .

“She has sullied the Holy procession. Her.

eyes have defiled the sacred images that we
bore with hymnal song and music through the
streets....

“The hymns of our innocent children, or our
young, clad in snow-white garments, her ears
have sucked in—and the beating of the holy
drum likewise...;who knows whether the
devil, the foul friend, has not transformed him-
self into this image of the Jewess, of this
cursed Rabbi’s daughter? Who knows whether
thus, he has not touched and polluted a holy
treasure of ours?

“What was the fiend up to, in this fair dis-
guise? We need not equivocate. Undoubtedly,
she is fair; a devilish beauty is hers—Do but
look at the wicked sparkle of her eyes, and

the modest and humble pose of her silken eye- ,

lashes. . . .
“See you her alabaster face? It has indeed
grown paler since her imprisonment, but duller

not a whit! . . . .Look at her fingers. How thin
and long and how transparent they seem in
the sunlight!.... -

has done indeed: -

“What a beauiful maiden!” exclaimed one of
our own Kn1g‘nthood—a member of one of our
best families. . . . .

“It was more than patience could endure.
The crowd noticed her and lay hands upon
her—The fiend did not even stir for defense-
How could she? There were all pure of sin.
They had been absolved. He had no power
over them.

“Let this then be the sentence of the devil .

-——of the fiend disguised in this form of a Jew-
ish maiden:

“Bind her hair, her fiendishly long hair, to
the tail of this savage horse....

“Let the horse fly over the streets and drag
her like a ‘corpse’ across the very streets she
has polluted‘in defiance. of our sacred laws.

“May her blood besprinkle them and wash
those that her feet have besmirched!”

Savage cries of joy fill the market-place and
when the great din is over the convicted
woman is asked her last wish.

She answers calmly: “I have one wish. Give
me but a few pins.”

“Her grief has made her mad!” think the
men of the court.

“Not so,” she answers serenely and frigidlyz
“This is my last wish; my last desire.”

They gratified her in that.

“Now, bind her!” commands the President of
the Court. -

The hands of the servants tremble as they
bind her long dark braids to the tail of the
horse, which is so wild that he can hardly
be controlled... . '

deeds too are tiny and more so;.. the »good and
the evil alike. . . . ‘ ‘

And a new thought occurs to her:

“What if the Lord, Blessed be His name,
were to halt the World process this very mo
ment and announce the final Judgment; would
not then the Advocate appear on the right side
of the Balance and pour out the contents of
his white sack, its tiny particles and little
grains of sand; would not the Accuser follow
and empty his sack on the left scale—his little
Wee bits and fragments? What a long‘process
that would be! What a multitude of little
things! '

“And when the emptying of the sack is com-
pleted, what then? Of course, the indicator
would be pointing right to the center!

“Such insignificant things weigh nothing; no
matter what their number. Indeed, what can
be the weight of a tiny thread, of a straw or
‘of an empty husk?

' “What might the decision of -the Lord be
then?

“Would he turn the whole into a void again?
Certainly not; for the Evil deeds do not Weigh
more than "the good. '

“Perhaps he might grant salvation to all.
But that, too, is unlikely, for the deeds of Good
do not prevail over those of Evil.

“It is hard to see what would follow then.

‘(Might he not say :‘ ‘Pass ye along. Rove yé
from the realms of Hell to Heaven amid Love_
and Hate, in tears of mercy or vaporous blood.
....from cradle unto grave, rove ye farther——'
even farther.’ ” ’

along the wall and fall upon a heap of sundry
weapons supported there. The so1dier—guards
have but a moment ago received their whips. . . .

Two long rows of soldiers and only a narrow
passage between.

Who is it that must run the gauntlet here?
0 , it is but an insignificant Jew. A torn
shirt is on his emaciated body and a skull-cap
on his half-shaven head. There he is being led
forth. '

But what is his crime? What has he stolen?
Has he robbed any one,———murdered?. . . .Perhaps
it is but a false _ accusation. Is that not an
ancient custom and were not many such before?

The soldiers smile as they ponder: What
was the use of having all of us here? Would
not half the number have sufficed!

ward. He walks directly on. The lashes fall
upon him. But he curses no one, neither does
he falter or fall.... _

skull-cap is on his head.* He walks on till he
falls. . . . .

up to him, and seized the cap that had cost so
many innocent lashes, and with it she flew up
to the little window of Heaven. I

And the third gift also found acceptance!
The pious Souls tried their best and spared no
trouble: the doors of Eden were now open!
And a voice of the “Orac1e" was'heard:

“These are truly beautiful gifts, of surpass-

use. They may not even serve for show....
But they are marvelous.”

VTHE JUDGMENT

JOSEPH OPATQSHU .

_Simka, the fisherman, a massive, uncouth
man, lived near Pincus, the teacher. Simka’s
peasant hut, with its straw roof that was
black with age, stood at the end of the Joldov-
ka, where the latter descends, stairlike, between
towering cliffs and falls roaring into the Vis-
tula. From far it seemed that the hut grew
out of the cliffs, that it rocked and washed in
the water like a little boat, surrounded by great
silver ribbons. ‘

The fisherman and his three sons stood
coatless and barefooted with their trousers
rolled about their knees, smearing large two-
eared pails with cheese; Simka’s Wife, a strong,
ruddy woman with a three-cornered, white
shawl on her head, also stood barefooted.
The toes of her, feet were webbed like those
of a goose. She was mending great nets. The
men put stones into the pails to prevent the
current from carrying them away. When a
pail filled with fish, they swiftly lit pieces of
thin wood, so that the fish would not see their
way out, and pulled the pail to the shore

The quivering fish were dumped into a net, ’
‘which was fastened to a raft tied to the shore

with thick ropes.

Simka’s youngest son, Zelik, sat on the raft.
He was about ten and had a Wart near his
ear. He threw pieces of bread into a ii-lask

Zelik grew in the woods like a wild goat.
Often he disappeared for days at a time. He
would climb into a salt barge and go miles
down the river. Nobody ever missed him.
Once when he was gone for a week, his mother
said something about it, but the rest remained
silent. There was a reason. When Zelik was
born with the wart, his mother was very
frightened and sent for the old witch to ex-
orcise the child. The witch advised her to
keep a close watch over the child, lest Wanda,
the queen of Vistula, steal him. The fisher-
man and his sons firmly believed that the
stretch of water near ‘which they lived was
demanding a human sacrifice, for their catches
The water must
have what belonged to it. V

Each time Zelik disappeared, all of them
kept still, thinking that the water had at last
taken its prey. But each time he came back,
as if to spite ,them.

The Yistula had cast him forth three times.
And because of this Simka wished to know
nothing of him, and did not want to teach
him, and Zelik always walked around in rags
and tatters. - T

“Why 'are you sitting there doing nothing,
you foo1?”,the mother cried out at Zelik‘. ’

“Go over to the ‘teacher’ and ask him how
much fish they want by Saturday.”

The boy caught up the flask with the gold-
fish, and ran into the wood.

Zelik thought that when he grew older he
would not fish with" pails. He would build
himself a raft and catch fish with nets. And
when he would grow rich (and he would surely
grow rich) he would buy a, pair of rubber
boots with those long tops that would fasten
with a buckle under the stomach, also a leather
coat, and he would sail over the water in a
real fishing smack, with a large steering wheel.
Then he would build himself a house with a.
glass veranda, exactly like the one Pincus, the
teacher, had. And perhaps he would give the
goldfish to Rachel. She had been angry at him
for the last two days, because he had cut off
But then, the cat
deserved it. When the fish lay eggs she had
no business to eat them. Yes, he would give
the fish to Rachel. True, goldfish aren’t to
be found everyday in the Vistula. But that
was nothing. When he grew older he would
catch a whale; cut its insides out, and sew a
pair of trousers and a coat for himself from
the skin, so that only his eyes would show.
And then he would swim with his fins all
standing straight up, down to the goldfish.
He knew, that they lived in the deepest whirl~
pools. But he would tell Rachel to change
the water, and to throw in a few bread-crumbs.

Rachel sat on the veranda consoling the
black cat that lay with a swollen back on a
soft basket.

“My poor little cat. Does it hurt much?
Don’t cry. Nikoli says it’ll heal soon. And
Zelik’s wart will get so big, so big, see, like
this,” and she stretched out both hands. “It’ll

be ugly,” she laughed. “Zelik with a tail on
his cheek!”

“Rachel, see, I've got a goldfish. Want it?”

‘Rachel turned away and pouted.

“I’m mad.” .»

“Why are you mad?” .

“Because you’re a, murderer.”

“But my father told me to. I swear. He
even told me to put your cat in a sack and
throw it straight into the water'froIn the hill.”

“And you think you'll be forgiven? God will
punish you. Nikolai says your wart must be-
come as big as the tail you cut off.”

Zelik lost himself for a moment. He put
his hand to his cheek and it seemed to him
that the wart was already becoming longer.

“It's a lie. How much will you- bet that I
won’t have it at all by tomorrow? I've got
something that’ll take it away."

“What have you got?”

“I'll put pigeon blood on it a few times,»

and it will dry and fall off.”

“Why didn’t you do it before?”

“Because mama says a wart is lucky. If I
take it off before I’m thirteen, my luck will

worth. I

Rachel, happy, with flaming cheeks, with
her shoes and stockings in her hands, followed
him. I
Siinbeams that had been hidden deep in the
woods suddenly began to play and weave

‘themselves around Rachel. They stole from
the rear, kissed her, sprang back, and all of

a sudden sprayed her with such silver light,
she half closed_ her eyes, and shrieked hap-
pily.

The birds became happier, springing up sud-
denly from the deep grass, and flapping their
wings. They remained hanging against the
flaming sun; trilling their, songs.

The woods whispered joyously. They smelled
of resin. It seemed that scores of fiddlers
were scattered all over the woods. They had
grown tired and gradually had ceased their
playing. But seeing the barefooted children
hand in hand on the soft ground, they began

to feel younger, and rubbed their brows rap-'

idly against the yellow resin, and the tall
pines trembled like tightly stretched— violin
strings, and they roared like a far, quiet sea——

over the field. He lifted his red legs like

a cloud, and began to shine,‘the stork stood up
on one leg, hid_its beak and half of its head

“Why do you need a goose-egg?”

“Will the stork let you do it?” -

“I'll put it in before dawn, when both aren’t

“And the stork that stands‘over there, can
it bring babies, too?”

“Of course,” and Zelik stretched his hands.

“Go home, Rachel, and bring an egg. The
nest is empty by now. Put on your shoes.”

Rachel joyously put on her shoes. She felt
more comfortable, and jumped up.

“Well, why don’t you go?”

“I’m too lazy to go myself.”

“Then I'll go with you." All right?”

The children leaping up and taking ,each
other by the hand, were lost from sight in
the woods.

Zelik approached the barn where the storks
had built their nest. He took the egg from

 

Rachel, held it in his lips, and swiftly like a.

cat ‘began to climb the straight wall. He
grasped a jutting piece of Wood, waited a
little as if seeking balance, and threw his body
on to the roof. The nest was made of an
old wooden harrow. In the harrow lay a bas-
ket, filled with grass and twigs. The close
odor of fish, toads, and chickensgstruck Zelik
in the face. Three large eggs lay in the nest.
He took out one of them, replaced it with the
goose-egg, and wanted to descend from the/'
roof, when the two storks suddenly appeared
and flew at himwwith wide—spread wings. Zelik
barely had time to get down, but he was so
frightened lest the sto'rks attack him that he
remained standing with the egg in both hands.

Rachel shrieked loudly.

“Ze1ik, jump down.” ,

Zelik, crouched, covered his face with both
hands, like one expecting a blow, and began
to slide down the incline of the roof.

 

I

YIDDISH SHORT STORIES \ . 29

The he-stork, flying swiftly by, stretched his
long neck and directed his sharp beak at
Ze1ik’s face. Zelik dodged the beak of the
stork, caught the blow in his- back, and fell
from the roof like a stone. The egg broke and
covered him with yellow liquid. V

Rachel thought that Zelik was surely dead
from the blow.’ She began to pinch herself
from fear, fell to her knees before Zelik, em-
braced him with both hands, and began to
kiss him and to cry.

“Zelik, my dear, does it hurtyou much, tell
me? It’s all my fault. Why did I bring the
egg?” - ' /

When Zelik recovered from the blow, he felt
a sharp pain inhis back, and remembered that
the stork had picked at him. Rachel, when
she saw blood on his coat, put her hands to
her head. “

“O, mama, blood.” ’

She again dropped to her knees before Zelik
and began to entreat. =

“Zelik, my dear, come to us. Braina will

put something on it. She Won't tell anybody.»

You'll see. I beg you, Zelik, come.”

She kissed him and began to cry again.
“It’s all my fault.”

Zelik, seeing her cry, became really fright-
ened. He forgot his pain, and, stood up.

_ “Come, Rachel. We’ll go down to the water.
You'll wash off the blood. All right? Don't
cry. It’s nothing. I have had bigger holes
in my head and they healed.”

“Are you mad at me, Zelik?"

“See, I love you so much,” Rachel said, and
bit hard into the flesh of the arm above the
elbow. All her teeth left red marks on the
skin.

They were silent. Theywalked over the dry
branches that, cracked under their feet, in
the direction of the River.

Rachel, like a little mother, began to attend
on Zelik. She took off his coat, then his shirt,
forgetting that a girl must not look on a naked
boy. She took her white apron, dipped it into
the cold water, and Washed Ze1ik’s wound.
Zelik lay on his stomach like a little Wounded
animal. He did not move. He was happy to

. know that Rachel was busy about him. When

she had washed the wound, she removed the
stains from the apron, wrung it out, put it on
the Wound, Went with him into the bushes in
the shade, and told him to lie down with his
face in her lap, so that the wound should dry
a little.

Zelik obeyed. He fell asleep almost at once.

At short intervals Rachel lifted the apron,
and looked to see if the wound had dried. But
the Wound still ran blood. Her heart over-
flowed with sorrow, and she began to weep
quietly. And, thus, weeping with red, brim-
ming eyes, ,Rachel nestled her little head among
the leaves, and also fell asleep.

be confused and looked at his mate who had
lowered her head in shame as if she were
saying, “I swear I am not guilty.” A little

The Vistula rippled. The ripples widened
into rings. The rings grew longer, swallowed
each other and grew still larger and larger, and
the erstwhile quiet Vistula, that had looked
like a crystal mirror” grew dark and rigid.

A swallow fluttered by, and seeing other 

swallows in the water he dropped from on high,
dipped his beak into the Vistula. The Vistula
rippled again. ‘ ~

Zelik related that below the “black stone,”
in a glass palace lived Wanda- the queen of
Vistula. In the summer. during the great heat,
when the Vistula -grew shallow, Wanda and her
sistersgathered on the stone and kidnapped lit-
tle children. She had attempted to catch him
three times but he knew a secret saying, which
he u‘ttered and that caused a fiery ring to grow
between him and her, and she could not reach
him.

“Zelik, why does Wanda need so many chil-_
dren?”

“Why does she need them? She kisses them
till their souls leave their bodies, and then she
eats their hearts.”

The children saw a flock of storks settle on
an island in the middle of the Vistula.

“They’re going to have a Wedding,” Zelik said,
turning to Rachel. “Come, we’ll get there with
the boat.” ' '

A TALE OF A HUNGRY MAN
DAVID PINSKI

Itsye had for two days in succession had
nothing in his mouth; in other words, he had
been hungering. But on the third day, for three
brass buttons he wheedled the lunch out of a
little Hebrew school pupil that studied in the
school of his yard——two little buttered cakes--—
and swallowed them eagerly. Thenhe becarné
angry. The cakes were a mere morsel to him,
but now he had at least a. little strength with
which to feel anger, and was seized with an
impulse to accomplish evil. V His fingers itched
with the desire. First of all he launched a
wicked kick in the direction of Zhutshke, the
little dog which the landlady of his house held
dearer than her own children. Zhutshke ran
off yelping with pain, but this was not enough
for Itsye. He tore up a stone that‘ had been
frozen to the earth and with all his strength
sent it "flying after the dog. It did not strike
the animal, however, but landed on the door of
Simkin the lawyer's house. It struck with a
resounding blow, and Itsye felt satisfied, for he
wouldn’t have cared had the stone struck Sim-

.kin or \Simkin’s wife on the head.

But with all thishis hunger was not appeased
in the slightest, nor was his seething heart
calmed in the smallest degree. He waxed still

angrier, for he felt that these were mere trifles,
that he had accomplished nothing with them.

He walked through thegate, glanced up and
down the street, and felt’ that he was an-enemny
to every passer-by, and especially to every one
that rode. He cursed them with bitter oaths
and would gladly, with his own hands, have
executed all tortures upon them. _
Another little pupil approached thegate; he i
was wrapped in a broad scarf and wore the
large shoes of a grown-up person. He held his
hands inside the scarf, and whether because
he was indifferent or because it was too cold,
' did not remove them to wipe his nose, from
.which mucus leaked down to -his mouth.

Out of his pocket peeped a crust of bread.
Itsye was seized with a longing for it, but ‘the
appearance of the poor child restrained him.
c; He sought, however, to convince himself that

3 he was incensed against the child, even as he
‘ 3 was against the whole world, and that he ought

g to give him a hard kick, as he had just done

handy. ’He was sorry that he hadn’t taken it
away. A whole big piece of bread. . . .

He leaned more heavily against the gate, not

knowing why and not knowing what was to
come, or what would result from his standing

‘there. The cold grew intense, but Itsye did

not feel it, for he was angry and paid no at-
tention to it. Besides, he had no place of
refuge. Up there in his garret it was still

colder. Moreover, there was nobody there, and .

he would have none upon whom to vent his
wrath.

He stood thinking of nothing. It was im-
possible for him to think. He no longer knew
precisely that he was in a rage; it seemed to
him that today he would work a very clever
piece of maiice. He knew nothing about dyna-
mite; otherwise he would have thought un-
ceasingly of bombs, and would have painted
himself pictures of the whole city, the whole
country, the world itself, being blown by him
into atoms. But. he gave no thought to any
definite project. He was certain that he would
do'something malicious enough. He felt it.

Two laborers passed by and were conversing
about hunting for a job. It flashed through his
head that he would stop looking for work even
if the employers starved to death! At the
same time he felt that his seeking was all in
vain. He would find no work today, any more
than yesterday, or the day before, or the day
before that, or the whole twenty-seven days in
whi‘ he had been searching for employment.

In his mind’s‘ eye he could see “tomorrow,”
—a dragging, cloudy day, on which he would

be faint with hunger‘. But he did not care to
think of tomorrow. Only “today”. . . Today
he ‘must accomplish something; then he would
know what would come tomorrow, the day
after, and all the other days. Wherefore he
remained leaning against the gate and looked
into the street with a cutting smile upon his
pale lips and in his dull, weary eyes, without
the trace of a thought in his head. He even
ceased scolding and cursing.

All at once he tore himself away from the L

gate and began to walk. He gave no heed to
direction. He lost his bearings, unknown to
himself. He strode on, unaware,that he was
moving. _His feet were like logs and he could.
scarcely lift them. He became soon aware that
he was no longer at the gate, and that he was
wandering about the street. Then it seemed to
him that he had wished and resolved to take
a little exercise. His feet must get warm. But
he affected not to be troubled about his feet
any more than about the cold itself, which
pierced him to the very marrow.

He walked along slowly, cautiously, calmly.
The street on which he was led at one end to;
the city-market an.d at the other to the muv
nicipal garden. He had no idea of whither he
was headed, but the nearer he approached to
the market the shriller and clearer became” the
noises from that vicinity. Then he realized
the direction in which his feet’ were taking him,
and, again it seemed to him that this was.ex-
actly. what he had desired and determined upon.
This was the very spot for him to execute his
plan of vengeance. He paused on thecurb.

he ‘stood there calm, motionless. It occurred

from the toiler; he stopped for a moment and
eyed his opponent with scorn.

“Hold your mouth, or I’ll stop it for you so
that you’ll be dumb forever. I'll show you
what ‘carrion-meat’ means, you bloody dog!”

The -porter Went on his way, grumbling and
cursing. Itsye muttered a few imprecations
and turned -his head in another direction.

“What have you planted yourself here for,

exclaim behind him. A
He looked around. Kaplan, the shopkeeper,

was standing in the doorway of his shop, eye-

ing hiin angrily. He‘ replied coarsely:

“What worry is that of yours?”

Kaplan grew excited.

“I’ll soon show you what Worry of mine it

Itsye spitefully refused to move. To hell

Now then,—what was_ it he had been think- ,

Itsye felt that he must refuse to stir, But
something moved his feet. It was the instinct
that a policeman must be obeyed.

He went off. Back to his street. Slowly,
scarcely moving his legs, without looking back
at the official.

He was frozen through and through. It was
as if he had.no feet. As he approached the
gate to his house he felt that it would be
pleasant to lie down a while. This he felt
against his will. He must remain in the street
because he was filled with rage and must vent
it in some vindictive deed. But his heavy,
frozen limbs drew him to his attic, where it
was frightfully cold, where the icy wind
moaned and whistled. The wind was not so
noisy here below. It seemed that his feet
knew he would hunt up all sorts of old rags
and wrap them around his frozen members.

He knew very well just what her barking
signified, and eyed her as if deliberating what
course to pursue. Quite cold-bloodedly he
wrenched the pot from her grasp, pulled out a
piece of bread and crammedéit into his mouth.
The tattered form seized him, with a frightful,
wailing yelp, and drew the pot toward her.
He raised it above her reach and continued to

chew. The first bite had excited him. He

began to eat faster, swallowing almost without
chewing. The old woman barked and howled

at the top of her voice, tugging at his arms.

his knees to the floor and sat down upon her.
She could no longer move.

Now he would eat in peace.

He stuck his fingers into the pot without
finding anything. He almost yelled with fury.

His heart began to bound wildly; his eyes-

sparkled. He must do something. He sprang
to his feet, and cried out, wildly, “More bread,
old witch!” ‘

He shoved her with his foot, emptied the
pot of water on her head and began _to loolg

came furious, not knowing what he did. The
old woman seized him, dragging him toward

the door with terrified shrieks. With all his
might he thrust her off. The old woman’s head
struck against the high oven; she groaned un-
cannily. Her moaning brought him to his
senses. He was frightened, and held in his
breath. He stepped toward her. Was she still
alive? The aged landlady began to get up. He
now breathed more freely and dashed out of
the room.

He was exhausted, yet excited. He desired
to weep,—to weep bitterly. He was thoroughly
ashamed of the -encounter with the deaf-and-
climb landlady. He had robbed her of her
wretched supper and had come near killing
her. And his hunger was now greater than
ever. “A-a-ah!”-

He pressed both his fists to his mouth and
began to gnaw at them. The pain grew in~
tense’, yet he kept on gnawing. He wished to
“feel his heart.”

The door opened and the old woman ap-
peared. A narrow shaft of light shone over
the dark steps, falling like a grey strip upon
Itsye’s shoulder. But the old woman did not
see him, and she sent after the supposedly
vanished fellow several infuriated screams,

more cutting than the most devastating curses.
Itsye shuddered, stopped chewing his! hands
and remained motionless, holding in his breath.
The landlady returned to her room and locked
the door.

“Locked out!” flashed through his mind at
once. His head became warm. He’ tried to

consider-what was now to be done, but he
saw no prospects before him. He felt an im- .
pulse to batter down the door, enter the room,
get into bed and lie there. He had already
rolled his fists into a ball. But after striking
the door a resounding blow, he ran down the ‘
stairs. Only when he had reached the bottom’
did he ask himself, “Why that blow?” '

It was snowing and a strong wind was
whistling and moaning. The cold Went right
through Itsye’s bones; he began to tremule,
and his teeth knocked together. He huddled
up in his tattered cotton coat, from which
hung patches, strips of lining and wadding. /
He groaned in despair and stepped back into
the entrance of the house. He felt a tug at
his heart, and was once more seized with a
desire to weep, to weep.

“What will come of this? What?”

_ He ‘could behold no answer. He would today
be frozen to death or die of hunger.

“Ol1, for something to eat! Food, food!”

He looked about. He was standing near a
cellar, the door to which was protected by a
heavy lock. He placed his hand upon the
lock, With'nnO_thO1lght of robbery. As he felt
the cold iron, however, it occurred to him
that it would be a good idea to break off
the lock and obtain access to the cellar. He
pulled at the lock. No. This was beyond
his strength. He repeated the attempt, and at

‘length summoned all his force and gave a

violent wrench. « ,
The lock merely made a loud noise; noth-
ing else." He was intimidated by the knock.

INTRODUCTION

Of the authors represented in this little col-
lection, Isaac Leib Perez stands foremost in
time and in renown. By more than one com-
petent critic he has been found worthy to ac-
cupy a distinguished place among the writers
of the nineteenth century in any tongue. Medi-
ocre as a dramatist, he rises as a poet and
particularly -as an artist in prose to moments
of unaffected genius. Rarely is his allegory
without that humanizing quality which keeps it
from degenerating into merely pictorial eva-
sions of thought. If allegory, not even in the
hands of a ‘Dante, cannot always be kept free
from the adulteration of a wilful symbolism,
there are times when it represents so success-
fully the inner intention of the creator that it
becomes in a very true sense a creation. That
arch-enemy of allegorical writing, Benedetto
Croce, has shown how in many a passage of
the great Florentine’s Commedia it is possible,
indeed, esthetically necessary,——to throw all
thought of Dante's concealed meanings to the
winds and let the picture and the words speak
for the human Dante behind them. Before
Croce, Federico De Sanctis—who anticipated
more than a little of Croce’s methods in literary
criticism, and to whom Croce is so greatly in-
debted—demonstrated the same sanative truth.
In such simple tales of Perez as “Bontsche the

 

Silent,” or the “Three Gifts” here included,-

the allegorical method is purged of all cryptic

’ flakes.

He reached the municipal garden. The pleas-

foot of which flowed the broad, deep river.
During the winter there was usually skating
on the river, and above, in the garden, a.
crowd of curious onlookers. But now there
was not a trace of human beings in the garden.
Not even the 1a1nps were visible through the
thick snow. They illuminated only the space
within a few paces of them. Itsye was at a

loss whether to feel vexed or not at the ab .

sénce of people. He did not look back, and
continued on his way. He approached the top
of the hill and looked down upon the frozen

river. He could see nothing. There came to
his ears the shrill /blows of heavy iron. Moug
jiks were opening a hole in the ice. And

in his weary thought he beheld a broad, deep
hole down there, and he was drawn thither.

The‘ suggestion came to him to hurl himself '

down from the hill into the deep stream. He
would raise no outcry; he would not call for
help. He would drown himself quite silently.

within them. His “Beruriah” is, to me, one
of the masterpieces of the short story in mod-
ern days, none the less contemporaneous for
its origin in a Talmudic setting. “The Tale
of a Hungry Man,” by which he is here rep-
resented, combines in admirable fashion his
early proletarian interests with his psychologi-

Asch is to the Yiddish novel what Pinski is
to the drama. ,He is that rare phenomenon,
a spontaneous artist with all the virtues and
defects of improvisation. Of his longer novels,
“Mottke the Vagabond” and “Uncle Moses,”

a poetic realism, a mingling of the so-called
romantic and the so-called realistic, that is
evident in so outwardly coarse a play as “The

Dr: Lazarovitch came home from the hospital

in the evening, locked himself in his cabinet,’

as his custom was of late, and remained alone
till supper. The servant had already knocked
at the door several times, calling him to- eat.
The doctor gave vent to the usual grunt that
meant he would soon come out, and re-

he was not let alone as usual. From the next
room was heard his wife, Anna Isakovna’s, soft,
weak voice, saying: “Boris, we are waiting.”
The voice woke the doctor from his day-dream.
He felt as if he heard a strange, unusual sound.

son, Mikhail, had gone to Moscow, and had
been admitted to the faculty of medicine in the
university, Dr. Lazarovitch tried to avoid his
family. The family consisted, besides his old-
est son, of his wife Anna Isakovna, who was
always sick (and whom he saw seldom, any-

. how), of a daughter, Jeyna, and of a boy, Solo-

mon, who attended the fifth grade of Gym-
nasium; and whom he loved very much. The
doctor avoided his home, trying to be there as
little as possible. And when he did come home
from the hospital, he always locked himselﬁ in
his cabinet, as if he were working. But to

‘tell the truth, he did not work. He had not

held a book in his hands since he left the Uni-
versity. He thought of his oldest son, who had

gone to Moscow, and had entered the_ Uni-
versity through the good offices of the doctor’s
‘good friend, Vasili Ivanovitch, the president of

a District Court. Dr. Lazarovitch knew, as well
as the rest of the family, that his son had not
been admitted through any good offices. The
“good offices” were mentioned only before
other people. Mikhail had adopted Christianity.
Though no one spoke of it, an.d the family never,
mentioned it, yet Dr. Lazarovitch had begun
to feel lonely since that time, and used to sit
‘ locked up in his cabinet. And
when, after two hours_ he left his room, he
would find the table deserted, and laid forione.
His whole family had become very serious,
each being occupied with his own concerns,
and Ana Isakovna went to bed very early, as
was her custom. The doctor, Would thought-
fully and hurriedly finish his meal, go back» to
his cabinet, take up an old
himself in a year-old speech of a Constitutional
Democrat regarding the Budget.

It was his custom to fall asleep over the
speech. Sometimes he would not awake until

‘morning. Sometimes‘ the old servant who had

been with him manyyears would come in and
wake him. Then he would undress and throw
himself on-a lounge that stood in the corner,
on which he examined patients in the daytime,
and above which hung an old magazine repro~
duction of Rembrandt’s “School of Anatomy.”

Because of this, the doctor was so much sur- _

prised when he heard his wife calling him.
He understood that something new must have
happened, and he was afraid of this new thing.

When he came out of his cabinet he found his

“Ryech,” and bury "

family waiting for him at the table. This was
so new to him that he grew glad and thought

' to himself that it was a very good thing to

eat together with his children. But in his
heart of hearts he was afraid of the sudden
innovation. He was too nervous to wait long,
0 he asked as soon as he sat down: “What

s happened?" ~ _

The children looked at each other, and re-
mained silent. Anna Isakovna, who felt better
than usually, answered: “Nothing has hap-
pened.”

At the silence that reigned at the table, the
doctor became still more excited. He cried that
something must have ‘happened; that they
ought not torture him, but tell him at once.

. Anna Isakovna answered him as if imparting

a great sorrow: “Mikhail writes that he is
coming home for Passover.”

The doctor grew silent. The rest were silent
also, as-if a dead man were in the house.

Thatnight the doctor did not fall asleep over
the “Ryech.” He was thinking of himself and
his son. Truth to say, he did not understand
why Mikhail’s apostaisy had made such an im-

- pressionon him. Neither he nor his had ever

beenreligious Jews. He himself remembered

« very little of his religion. Passover and Yom

Kippur were to him merely vague memories of
childhood. His father, a storekeeper in a little
town, had been a pious Jew. But since he had
left the town in his youth going to study in
Moscow, he had not seen his father and had

lost track of the holidays. Anna Isakovna, with ,

whom he had become acquainted in Moscow,

nothing of Jewish holidays. And his children

were reared, ‘like the children of so many 
parents in his circumstances, without any tra- '

ditions. They lived according to customs and
holidays of his Gentile neighbors.
urally, Mikhail grew up ripe for Christianity.

.He was able, and from the fifth grade on he ‘

began to show an exceptional faculty for mathe-
matics. When he began to study in earnest, no
one of the family had the slightest doubt that
Mikhail, in order to avoid the obstacles that lay
between himself and his career, would have to
adopt Christianity. The father, the mother,
and Mikhail himself, had always thought so,
though they never said a word about it. Then,
why did it torture him so, now that Mikhail
had already done it? What new thing was. it
that was waking in him, making him a stranger
in his own house? '

The doctor had thought much about this in V

the last days, trying to revive the memories of
his own lost" years to the utmost of his powers.
But it was hard. When he began to think of
them he would grow tired. ‘ His broad-boned
body grew heavy and he became sleepy, for in
the twenty-three years that he had spent. in
the provincial town within the Pale, he"-had for-
gotten how to think. Once upon a time, like
other students of his age, he had been an
idealist. He would finish his studies, he then

thought, and go to the people. He -would estab- A

1/ish himself in some out-of-the-’Way village,
there to heal the peasants and their Wives and

many students talked of that at the time. But

go to any out-of-the-way village. He fell in love
with Anna Isakovna, a daughter of Director

Solomon. Solomon, an old, worked-out factory
invalid,I who had four daughters, was often
visited by the Jewish students in Moscow. The
girls played the piano, and the Director’s home
was aristocratic. The lackey, an old Gentile,
‘served at the table in gloves, though there was
not much to serve.
piano-playing made a deep impression on Dr.
Lazarovitch, and to his share fell the weakest
and ugliest of the Director's daughters,‘Anna.

But as soon as he married the aristocrat he
forgot all his ideals. He went with his wife,
who began to ail shortly after the wedding, to
a town

Iloro he bega.n to build up a practice. This
partly meant that even in the Pale on.e could do

much, that ideals are necessary not only in the *

village, but also in the town. But soon the
doctor became acquainted with the intellectuals
of the town, with the druggist and the Presi-
dent of the Court, and spent most of his nights
He tried
to avoid being at home. He did not love his
wife over much after she began to ail, but this
did not prevent his having five children with
her, two of which had been still-born; the other
three had grown up almost without his knowl-

edge, till his card-playing had been interrupted

by the apostasy of Mikhail.

 

Dr. Lazarovitch became more and more rest-T
less as the time of his son's arrival from Mos-
cow approached. The entire house lapsed into

silence. All seemed afraid of SOnl€t1l'lll';’. Tlie
doctor began to feel like a stranger in his own
house, and could not find a placefor himself
anywhere. H\e ceased to go to tire club, and
could no longer sit over the “Byech” in his
cabinet. First it seemed to him .tl1at he was

' restless because he was unused tothings, and

was afraid of the new event in his home life.

, As soon as he would get used to the fact that

his son was a Christian, and the town would
know of it, and all would cease to talk of it at
last, he too, would become quiet; and his life
would resume its natural course. .But soon he
realized that his restlessness was not due to
any strange circumstances, but lay much deep-

‘er. He was afraid of something, and did not

know the cause. He said a thousand times to
himself that nothing had happened, that his
son's apostas'y~ had changed neither himself
nor his son. He himself was not so religious
and fanatical as to believe that his son’s change
of religion should have a deeper meaning, be-

cause, in truth, neither he nor his son believed

in God. So how could his son's outer meta-
morphosis change his inner psychological con-

‘ dition? And again, would it pay the able young

man to give up his career, his abilities, his fu-
ture, all for the sake of a religious supersti
tion? Had not Mikhail acted logically when he
removed once and for all the obstacles that bar-
ricaded the path of his future? But all these
explanations could bring the doctor no rest.
He felt that something more than a mere out-
ward change had taken place; that a wall stood
between him and his son; that it divided one
generation from the other; that his son was

 

YIDDISII SH.OR'1‘ S'|.‘ORIES 9 65

not a continuation of himself, but that some-
thing ended in his own self, and something
new had begun in his son; that they already

‘belonged to two different worlds. And he was

afraid and restless when he contemplated the
wall that stood between them.

Two days before Passover, Mikhail came
‘home. The doctor could not see him. He was
afraid to meet him face to face. He would run
about among his patients and come home late
atnight, and when in the mornings he‘heard
his son’s Voice in ‘the next room he would
tremble. Hewould look through a crack in the
door and try to see how the boy looked. But
his son had not changed at all. The same "child-
ish face with its familiar childish eyes which
always touched the doctor’s fathering heart.
The doctor wondered that his son had not at
all changed after baptism. He still looked
exactly the same- But the doctor was afraid
of him. -

Throughout the time Mikhail was at home
the house seemed dead. The usual noise of the
children on their arrival from school was heard
no longer. The children, who always walked on
tiptoe now, could not be heard in the next room.
They sat reading, each, in a different corner, as
if they were ashamed to look at each other.
The silence strained the doctor’s nerves still
more. \ He wanted to go to the children many
times, and play with them, as he used to do
when they were small. But as soon as he saw
(Mikhail through the keyhole, he grew fright-
ened and restrained himself.

’-And yet the apostate touched his heart more
than the others. It seemed to him that the boy

looked weaker and sadder since he had‘ become

’ a Christian, and the doctor began to pity him.

He had never felt so’ near to any of his chil-v
dren before. He was glad and yet sorry that
he felt so toward his son. Oncehe saw him
through a window reading in a cor11er of the
room, dressed in the blue uniform that fitted
him but poorly. The boy felt strange in the
house, and was afraid to -talk loud.
In his eyes and about his lips lay
the shadow of a great grief like that which
lingers about a girl who has lost her innocence.
The doctor noticed it and a wave of pity swept
over him for the child who was inaugu ating
his career in such a sin. He could not restrain
hi.1nself,. walked into the room, approached the
boy,'laid~ his wide, thick hand on the weak,
childish shoulders, and looked into Mikhail’s
eyes.

“Mikhail, how do you feel?”

The boy trembled. At sight of his father he
grew pale, and coniusedly and involuntarily
pressing himself to his father, cried: “Papa.”
But he soon reminded himself of sometliing,‘
and remained standing, silent and sliamefaced.‘
“How did you enter the University?” Dr.

.Lazarovitch asked roughly, and wiped his thick

face'with a broad hand. _
The boy was silent for a moment.‘ At last”
he viciously hit his thin pale lips and answered:
“I didn’t know you would take it like this.”
The father was silent. I
In a minute the boy again said: I,

“It is unnecessary,” the father sternly’ an-J

-“Why?” the boy asked.

‘ The doctor moved closer to the boy, looked’

straight in his eyes, with a moody, sinister
glance, and said: “We aren’t talking of religion.
You know I am not religious. We are discuss-
ing a principle. And you have denied that
principle once. What would the good he in
your becoming a Jew again? You can’t_ change
what you have done. Just like a girl who has
lost her honor——she can’t regain it‘. Under:

The doctor seized the boy’s head and kissed
him, perhaps for the first time in his life.
Then he left the room.

A few days later the doctor heard another
bit of news: Joseph Kalmanovitch, Mikhail’s
schoolmate, had also turned Christian. It was
an open secret that Joseph was in love with
Jenya. The town considered them already en»
gaged. The doctor waited till the young man

, came to his house to see how his daughter

would treat him. In a few days the doctor
found the young man in his house, and Jenya
went out with him as if nothing had hap-

_ pened. Joseph had been treated as usual. The

doctor began to wonder and it occurred to him
that after -all, it was only he who wasso re-
actionary and superstitious that apostasy made
too deep an impression on him. Yet the doctor
could not ‘understand how his daughter could
receive the young man after Mikhai1’s apostasy,
and how An'na Isakovna‘ bore the thing so

patiently. He promised himself to talk to his

(laughter. She told him clearly that she did
not care whether her husband was a Jew or a
Christian. She loved the man. If her father .
objected to a marriage between them, she
would live with Joseph anyway. It was only
then that his situation grew clear in the doc-
tor’s eyes. His children were leaving his house
and his religion, and he himself would remain
, in his old age lost among strange beliefs and
perhaps be supported by his children,’ and bring
up strange grandchildren._ And maybe his chil-
dred would baptize him before death so that
.he should lie in the graveyard together with
them. This woke the doctor from his apathetic
condition, a11d he resolved to take action.

At the same time the doctor persuaded him-
self that he had become religious, and he would
seek out small groups that congregated to pray
at certain places and visit them between eve--
ninggprayers. But he could not deceive him- 1
self. The prayers of thecommon, eveiry-day r
Jews who ran into the small synagogue to free .
themselves for an hour from a day’s work, and
to give God His due, desirous of getting
through with their duties as soon as they
could, made no impression on him at all. He
did not understand the prayers. He did not
understand the grimaces they made, and their
continued whining and shaking struck him as
being wild. Yet he did not lose hope,, and was
inwardly sure that somewhere there did exist
a great, strong Judaism, a Judaism that re-
paid the burdens borne for its sake, a Judaism
that gave Jews strength to bear suffering and

‘still remain Jews——and it was his to seek out

that'Judaism which would repay him for the
happiness lost in his children. ' \

He tried to observe the Jewish holidays in
his home. He himself did not know much
about them. He remembered nothing about
them, and appeared comical in his own eyes

, when he went out on the street to buy Kosher

meat, or bread, or matzoth and bring-it home.
Yet the people in the house had taken it all
very seriously; on Passover the matzoth were
placed on a serving dish, put on the table, and
all were afraid even to touch it. They all
tried to be as serious about it as was he him-
self——but he knew that it was a farce. No
one in the house knew anything about the
holidays. The holidays they kept were the
holidays of their neighbors. Where any part

of the town celebrated, the doctor’s house cele- v

brated with it—Easter yvith the Russians, Christ»
mas with the Catholics, but of their own holi-
days they knew nothing. Because of this it
was rather comical that he should all of a

‘sudden try to celebrate their “own” holidays.

Mainly he did it for hisrfourteen-year-old son,

‘Solomon, who caused him more unrest than all

the others. He knew that the boy suffered, that
he was of a different make-up than the other
children. It had been very hard to make it
possible for the boy to enter the gymnasium.
It was at a time when hate toward Jews was
already raging among their Gentile neighbors,
and was more than ever in style. The boy was
forced to suffer much at the hands of his Gen-
tile schoolmates. Often, when he came home
from school, his wet, frightened eyes seemed

‘to ask the terrible question: “‘Why?” In the

beginning, when he was yet a child, he asked
his father: “Why did the Jews do that?” He
was tortured so at school, but when the doctor

A Wasunable to give him a clear, true answer,"

 

he ceased to ask «the question. Soon the child
knew the full taste of being a Jew; he grew
used to it, and bore it like a grown-up, with
humility and patience. He asked no more ques-
tions, and it was seen that hetwithdrew fur-
ther and further into himself. He had grown
very much in the few years he spent in the
gymnasium. He read serious books, and his
forehead was already wrinkled. He"was quiet,
and a sneering smile towards everything and
everybody lingered about his lips—tl1e smile
of the suffering Jew towards the rest of the
world. The doctor was more ashamed of him-
self before the boy than before his other chil-
dren, and felt that he must do something to
change the situation. He knew the responsi-
bility he carried in the eyes of the child; that
it was his to take care that this boy too did not
become an apostate. This drove him to think
of some practical remedy. He often wanted to
speak to the youngest son about the older one’s
apostasy, but he could not. He was afraid to
hear the truth from him—a thing he had heard
from none heretofore-——that the fact that Mik-
hail turned Christian was due more to himself
than to Mikhail. He did nothing to prevent
his son from changing faith. He already read
the‘ answer in the sneering smile that hung on
the boy’s lips, and even more, in that the boy
avoided the house more than he himself did‘
He spent most of his time at a schoolmates and

was rarely seen in the house. Since the oldest
brother had becomea Christian he had avoided
the house still more. v

In this avoidance of the house the doctor saw
a personal insult to himself. “The child avoids

me,” he said to himself. This made him feel '

still worse and he would think: ‘.‘Why does
he avoid me?” And once when he was told
that Solomon had not come home for two nights
(those were the first nights after the arrival

of the apostate), the doctor sought the boy out

at his friend’s and spoke to him:
“Why don’t you come home? Why do you
run from the house?” .3
“I run from the house? It is you, father, who
runs from the house,” the boy answered boldly
In the answer the doctor heard the whole
inner truth——that he was lonely and avoided
the housewhich he had built up; in this'an-

-swer he heard the whole poverty, the whole

forlornness of the situation in which he found
himselfyand he ceased to trouble his son with
further questions.

The doctor began to take great interest’ in
what was going on among the Jews. He read
Russo-Jewish newspapers, thought much of Jew-
ish interests, and found that a new Jewish life
was beginning in Palestine, that Jews were
emigrating there, and becoming farmers; that

there was hope of a Jewish state being founded’, ‘

Where Judaism could develop freely and frankly
to astrong and rich fruition. Palestine awoke

in the doctor the memories of his childhood,

years, of his father, the storekeeper ina little

Passover, Whe11 all in the house was so clean, I
and the family gathered at the Seder. It-

seemed to him that all this was closely related
to Palestine; that it came from Palestine. And
there, in the new Palestine this all would show

itself stronger and freerhand the greater Juda-I

ism would begin to develop. His eyes were

suddenly opened and he beheld in Palestine the I

great Jewish hope, so great, so holy, that repaid
Jews for their suffering,»that gave Jews the
courage and the strength to bear all pain and
insult for its sake. Palestine gave compensa-:
tion for all. He remembered, as in a dream,
the Bible and the pictures in the Bible, and his
father. The pious storekeeper’s life suddenly
grew more interesting to him. He saw a cer-
tain relationship between his father, the poor,
forlorn Jew in his little home town, and the~
heroes of the Bible. It was Palestine that

bound them together. His father,‘ the store- /

keeper, came from the same land that knew
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He loved the. same
life they loved, and had the same duties and
customs they had. But here, in exile, where he
was oppressed he could not live like the pa-
triarchs, the tillers of the soil, the shepherds.
Here he had but the Sabbath and the Passover
that the Patriarchs had; but there, in the land
of the patriarchs, the Jews lead a patriarchal
life; they till the soil themselves; they guard
the sheep themselves, and live in godly piety,

their ‘holiness. There he would see with the
same eyes and feel with the same emotions the
Jewish Passover, the Jewish Sabbath, the Jew-
ish holiday, as long ago, when he was a child
and lived in‘ the house of his father- and mother.

The doctor hid deep in his heart the secret
that he had found Palestine as one hides a
great treasure. He was afraid to confide it to
his family. He became more restful and sure
of himself._ He no longer sat locked up in his
cabinet whole nights long. He went no longer
to the club; he began to eat together with his
children; ‘he even became very kind to his
wife. A sort‘ of hidden joy smiled out of his

1 eyes, and no one knew what it was, just as

no one knew the cause of the doctor’s sudden

A change of habits.

“Why not?”

It was soon seen that the boy had been in-
terested in Palestine for a long time._ He was
organizing a student’s’Zionist Circle and knew,
of all that was going on in Palestine, even‘ to
the name of all the Jewish colonies. The father
was beside himself with joy, and continued to,
pat the boy's shoulders.

“Would you like to go with me to Palestine?”

The boy looked at him in wonder.

“Do you really mean it, papa?” -

“Of course, Solomon, of course. Don't you
see that I am being stifled here? What have
I got here?”—The doctor wanted to get‘__rid
of all that had tortured him of late. He soon
restrained himself, however, and ended hi
words, half-laughingly:-, 

“Of course, of course, Solomon.
there are great, fine—That is the place for.

you will go with me?”

“Let them remain if they like this place
better,” the child replied. “I want -to be there
where Jews are equal to others; where Jews
are free.”

“Where Jews are free!.” . The doctor muttered
as if to himself. “Good, good, Solomon. Let

ea.se here.” The tloctor was struggling with
something in himself. He swiftly disengaged
himself from the boy and left the house, fear-

told, weary eyes, which sat in a heavy, sleepy

body overgrown with so much fat that it
seemed his heart could never be reached,-
and yet....

From then on the father and the son found
themselves in the strange house. They felt
themselves richer and freer than the others;
and looked at the mother, the sister, and the

' apostate, with pity. They would sit till mid-

night over a map of Palestine. Solomon would
show where the Jewish colonies lay and what
they were called; they had even begun to study
Hebrew. The doctor gave it up after the sec-
ond 1ess0n—his_head was too old to learn any-
thing now. But not Solomon. When Solomon
spoke of the new life, when father and son
dreamed of Palestine, the old doctor's heart
grew glad, his great body became lighter, and
he felt that things were as once upon a time,
when he lived with his father, the storekeeper
———once, in his childhood years. . . . _
One fine evening the doctor called together
his family, and tried to deliver a long speech.
He did not succeed. At the last moment, when
all were solemnly assembled, he entered the
room, struck the table with his fist and cried
in a voice not altogether calm, “Who will go

him, “Chayim, do you want to leave the coun-
try in the regular, legal manner?”

“Do you need to ask that?” replied Chayim
quickly.

“Well, just listen. My sister Eda is about
to leave for Berlin, to meet her husband,
Sandrovitch. The passport is made out in the
name of both of them, but he left earlier than
he expected . . . so that you can travel with
the passport, as her husband __ . .” -

There flashed upon Chayim’s memory the
black eyes and the bewitching countenance of
Eda, whom he had known well and with whom,
in the days of the revolution, he had spoken
only of matters connected with the struggle.
Now, learning that she was already married,
he felt a queer twinge at his heart, and growing
pale with emotion, he answered quickly, “Yes,
certainly, I'll go as her husband.” Then notic-
ing that Henich eyed him suspiciously, he
added: “I’l1 avoid capture.”

Henich, being an amiable sort of chap,
slapped him on the back, “You—captured.
That doesn’t worry us at all!” he exclaimed.
_Then, after having made arrangements for
leaving in about a week, they separated.

That week went by as slowly as a year for
dhayim. But not because he was so eager to

. leave Warsaw and its terrors behind; rather

because of his desire to travel as the husband
of dear, beautiful Eda. The make-believe re-
lationship began to take on for him a most
serious aspect, and as he lay in his room,
which was situated in a remote section of the
town, he conjured up the‘ pretty face QC

Sandrovitch’s young wife Eda, who would soon
be under his own personal care. A-trembling,
new-borne longing took possession of his
heart . . .

Boruch Sandrovitch—Boruch Sandrovitch. He
repeated the other man's name over and over
again, so as not to betray himself at the border.
And so, muttering the name countless times
during the week he began to feel that from
now on he was no longer Chayim Grossman,
former revolutionist, but Boruch Sandrovitch,
a student of Berlin University, a fair-haired
fellow of twenty-five, whom the beautiful Eda
loved to distraction .

“Well, here is your wife!” Eda’s father, a
tall, broad-boned Jew, with a patriarchal beard,
and gold-rimmed spectacles on his aristocratic
nose, turned to Chayim, who, at the words, was
overcome by a. sensation of sweet warmth that
suffused his entire being. He stole a bashful
glance at the slender Eda, who made a pretty
picture as she stood therein‘ her traveling
clothes, smiling sweetly at him.

“Take good care of her,” added Eda’s mother,
a woman of son1e fifty years, with large eyes
and dressed in black. Q

“She’l1 be‘ as precious as the apple of my
eye,” blurted Chayim fervently, and of a sud-
den blushed at the impassioned tones of his
promise.

“And be sure not tolforget that you're Boruch
Sandrovitch,”. admonished Eda, beaming at him
with the same sweet, friendly smile.

.“I’l1 remember that only too well,” exploded

“Here is the passport; I am now in your
hands,” declared Eda, giving him the book.

Chayim placed it carefully in his pocket, and
gazing at Eda most eloquently he managed to
exclaim: “This is a most pleasant charge.”
And immediately he regretted his words. '

It was three hours’ ride to the border. Chayim
sat the whole time at Eda’s side, and wishing
to become more intimate, he suddenly turned
to her and suggested, “I think it would help
to ‘avert suspicion on our journey, if I were to
use ‘thou’ in addressing you, and you likewise
with me.” .

Having offered this short, practical sug-
gestion he turned red, and his heart beat wildly,
as he waited for her approval.

“I really am in doubt,” she hesitated. “In
high society man and wife use ‘you’ in address-
ing each other.”

“But that might arouse suspicion in our case
-—I mean, that fthou’ would be more to our pur-
pose,” urged Chayim.

She finally consented.

Unfortunately, however, Chayim could find
no opportunity for using the coveted familiar
pronoun. At last the longed-for chanced ar-
rived. He was gazing out of the window. The
sun, like a blood-red disc, was setting behind
a thick forest, gilding the tree-tops with its
dying splendor. Chayim, entranced by the
scene, cried out, “Just see, Eda, see thou, how V
beautiful! ”

Eda arose and looked through the window.
“Wonderful!” she exclaimed.

Chayim was right beside her, but instead of

looking at the beautiful sunset he sought to
penetrate Eda Sandrovitch’s face, and ‘he grew
sad.

A moment later and the sun had sunk be- W

neath the horizon, as if the. black forest had
engulfed it.

They sat down and Eda began: “You
know——” .
“Thou knowest,” corrected Chayim. “We

might betray ourselves.”

“Don’t worry on that score,” she replied, stub-
bornly. “You know that we’re almost at the
border.”

“We should be all the more careful for that
very reason. So then, what dost thou say,
Eda?”

Eda. smiled good-naturedly, replying, “if you
desire to play the game, by all means, with the
greatest of pleasure!” And then, more play-
fully, she added, “I say, my dear Sandrovitch,
we’re soon at the border.”

“What of that, darling Eda?” He smiled in
return, clasping her velvety little hand.

,She did not withdraw her hand. This made
Chayim bolder. He pressed closer to her, ever
so close, and whispered tenderly, “What a
sweet, darling child thou art!”

Shepgazed at him with her large black eyes,
in silence. _

At last they‘ pulled into Alexandrovna, the
border station. ‘ The train suddenly became
alive with nervous activity. A tall gendarme
with forbidding mustache entered, crying out
in official tones, “Passportsl”,

“And you?” asked the latter in Russian, turn-

“She is my wife,” answered Chayim, in the
same language.

“Very well,” was the response, as if ap-
proving the match. Chayim felt distinctly flat-
tered with the approval. _

The gendarme collected the passports of the
other occupants and then left, locking the door
of the coach. '

“And now We are in very truth man and
wife,” whispered Chayim passionately to Eda.

“Yes, of course,” Eda nodded.

Her acquiesence made Chayim very happy,
and he turned boldly to her, asking tenderly,
“Wouldst thou have a bite to eat?”

She smiled, and replied good-humoredly, “Not
I, but perhaps you would—that is, thou wouldst,

beloved,” she hastened to correct herself.

“Yes, I’m really hungry.”

He arose, took down her little traveling bag,
which contained their lunch, and gave it to
her.’

She opened it and took out the food that her
mother had prepared.

THE KISS

L. SHAPIRO

Rab’ Shachneh’s hands and feet trembled,
and he felt an awful bitterness in the mouth.
It seemed to him, sitting in the chair, that the
wild uproar of the street, the howling and the
Whistling, the cracking and the ringing of the
shattering window-panes, were taking place
within him, within his own head.

The pogrom had broken out with such fear-
ful suddenness that he found himself forced
to fly home without stopping to lock his shop.
But on reaching home, he discovered no one
there. Sarah and the children had, seemingly,
managed to hide themselves somewhere, leav-
ing the house and their few belongings in God’s
care. He himself, however, did not think of
hiding. He did not think of anything, in fact.
He was conscious only of the wild noises of
the street, and the unbearable bitterness in
his mouth.

The noises sounded now nearer, now more
distant, like the roar of a neighboring conf1a-
gration. But suddenly, it surrounded the house
on all sides at once. The window-panes

,cracked, rocks flew into the room; and the

next instant, young , peasants with flaming,
drunken faces, carrying knives and clubs, came
crawling through doors and windows. \

It then occurred to Rab’ Shachneh that he.

ought to do something about it. And he lifted
himself laboriously from the chair, and began

 

 

 

YIDDISH SHORT STORIES 89

to crawl under a sofa, right before the" eyes
of the rioters. The peasants roared with
laughter.

“Nah! There is a fool for you!” and one 'of
them grabbed him by a leg. “Eh, you! Get
up!”

This brought Rab’ Shachneh to his senses,
and he began to weep like a child.

“Boys,” he pleaded, “I will let you have
everything—the money, the jewelry—‘—every-
thing. Spare my life! Why should you kill
me‘? I have a wife and children.”

But nothing availed him. They took every-
thing, and beat him besides, struck him in the
face and chest, kicked him in the abdomen
with mad ‘fury. He cried, pleaded, and they
kept up their beating.

“Vasily, Vasilinka, you know me! Your

father worked for us. Haven’t wealways‘ paid

him well? Vasilinka, save me! Save . .

A violent blow on the chest cut short his
pleading. Two young peasants sat on him and
pressed their knees into his abdomen. Vasi-

"linka, a small spare fellow with a crooked face

and grey eyes, spoke up proudly: .

“You paid him, did you! Father worked, so
you paid. I would have’ just liked to see you
refuse to pay him.”

Nevertheless it pleased Vasilinka greatly
that Rab’, Shachneh should have appealed to

_ him for mercy, and he thereupon" turned to the

others. ~
“Now, boys, enough! Let the- carcass be.
You can see that it’s barely gasping.”
lRe1uctantly, one by one, the peasants tore

themselves away from their victim, and began
to leave the house, smashing whatever articles
had previously, escaped their notice.

“Nu, Shachneh,” Vasily turned to him, “you
have me to thank for being alive yet. The
boys would have made short work of you, if it
hadn’t been for me.”

He was on the point of leaving with the
others, when something occurred to him that
made him halt.

“There!” he said, extending his hand to Rab’

I Shachneh. “Kiss!”

Rab’ Shachneh raised his bloodshot eyes
and looked at him bewildered. He did not
understand. ‘

Vasily’s face darkened.

“Didn’t you hear me? Kiss, I tell you!”

Two of the peasants halted in the doorway,
watching the scene. Rab’ Shachneh looked at
Vasily and was silent. Vasily’s face turned
green.

“Ah, Jew-face that you are!” He gnashed
his teeth, and drove his open hand into Rab’
Shachneh’s face. “You hesitate! Oh, boys!
Come back here!"

The two peasants came up closer.

“Ah, nu! Get to work, boys. Since he's
such a fine gentleman, he's got to kiss my
foot! If he won’t . . ."

_He sat down upon a chair. The two peasants
grabbed hold of Rab’ Shachneh, and ﬂung him
at Vasily’s feet.

“Pull off thatboot!” Vasily commanded,
kicking Rab’ Shachneh in the mouth.

_.... ...__....-,. ,...._..¢_ ,

 

YIDDISH SHORT s'rom1-.:s 91

Rab’ Shachneh slowly pulled the boot off the
peasant’s foot.

They stood face to face—a red dirty foot
smelling strongly of perspiration and a beaten-
up face with a long, noble, dark beard. Strange-
ly enough the beard wasn’t harmed much. It
was torn and plucked in but a few spots, but

= it retained the dignity of respectability. From

? above, Vasily’s crooked face looked down, glar-

ing with lts grey eyes.

“Kiss, I tell you!” ‘

And another kick in the face followed the
command.

For a moment all was silent and motionless,
then Rab’ Shachneh bowed down his head, and
Vasily emitted a sharp frightful cry. All of the
five toes and part of his foot had disappeared
into Rab’ Shachneh’s mouth. The two rows
of teeth sank deep into the dirty, sweaty flesh.

What followed was wild and lurid, like an
n evil, revolting dream.

1_ The peasants struck Rab’ Shachneh with
their booted feet. They kicked him with such
fury that it resounded loud and hollow like an
empty barrel. They pulled out his beard in
handfuls. They dug their nails into his eyes
and tore them out. They searched out the
most sensitive parts of his body and ripped out
pieces. His body shivered, trembled, bent and
twisted. And the two rows of teeth pressed
on convulsively closer and closer, and some-
thing cracked inside the mouth, the teeth, the
bones, or perhaps both. All this while, Vasi-
linka raved, shrieked, screeched like a stuck

How long this lasted, the peasants did‘ not
know. They had taken no notice of the time.

It was only when they saw that Rab’ Sachneh’s’

body no longer moved that they stopped at
last. A shudder shook them from head to foot
when they looked into his face.

His torn out eyes hung loose near the bloody
sockets. His face was no longer recognizable;
while What was left of his beard hung in blood--
congealed strands. The dead teeth, with a
piece of the foot still between them, glared
like -those of adead wolf.

Vasilinka still wriggled, no longer upon the
chair, but upon the floor. _ His body was twisted
like a snake, and from his_ throat came long-
drawn-out‘, hoarse_sounds. His gray eyes grew
large, dim and glassy. It_Was1eyident that he
had lost his mind. ‘ . « . ..

“God help us,” the terrified peasants
screamed, as they fled from the house. .

Out in the street, the pogrom, in all its beast-
ly ferocity, was still raging, and amidst the
many noises, no one heard the broken cries of

the living man who was slowly expiring within

the jaws of the dead man.
