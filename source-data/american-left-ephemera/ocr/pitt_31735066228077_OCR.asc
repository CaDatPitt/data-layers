This is why Marx criticised so sharply the Sismondian crises
theory: '

"It is purely a tautolegy to say that crises are caused b§3s
the scarcity cf solvent csnsumers,-sr of a paying.consumption. '
The capitalist system ﬁnes not knsw any other modes of consump-
tion but a paying ones. . . If any sommsdities are unsaleable,
it means that as selvent purchasers have been found for them,
in other wards, consumers‘. .‘. Bax if sue were to attempt to
clothe this ﬁsutolegy with a.ssmb1sﬁce~sf a profounder justifi-
cation by saying thatsths wﬁrkiig class receive tau small a

(a) The Possibility of Crises As An Exgression Of The Contradiotion
In Commodities. . '

Marx finds the general possibility of crises in the fact that.
the proaucts ere produced as commodities.

"In the case of direct barter, proauotion on the part of
the producer is mainly directed towards the satisfaction of his
_own neeae or, with the somewhatfwidereﬁeveloyment of the divi-
sion of 1ebour,_the needs-of~eoeprooueere known to him. ‘It is

- only the excess which_ie exﬂhﬂged as eommoditiee and whether
the eXceee_ie exchanged or_no%; is noh.eeeehtie1. In the case
-of commodity producﬁion.hhe"eonvereioh of the groduct into
money. the  is   (absolute conditeion.
—— Editor). ’hireoh pro&ue$ion for oneie own needs falls to the
ground. with the.nomeee1e.me get the crises." (Marx, Eheories
of Surplgejvelueg V61; 11; Per$FiIg<pe 281) ‘

In so fer ee society prooeeee the yﬁodeete ee commodities, i.e.,
in so far as we heve before ﬁ§*a.E@$ﬁ@diﬁ?7e@@homy; the possibility“
of crises are already conheia@d“ihﬁt:-CveryV£omm©ﬂi£y nature of the

During the space of time which lies between the moment of incep-
tion of the credit operation and that of the actual payment of the
money, the value of the commodity may change. The payment might, be-
sides this, not be made in time. The separation between purchase and
sale and the independence of one from the other then again revealed.
The peasant for.instenee buys 20 yards of linen at the price of MO
marks. He does-not, however, pay thie_mene¥ immediately, as he has
not yet eold.hislwheet_ the velue ef which is similarly NO marks. The
weaver, on his part, buys machinery which he promises to pay after he
will have‘reeeive&lthe.money free the~peeeent~ .But if the Value Of the
wheat changes at the time when'the:peeeeﬁt can sell it and he can
realise for it less than HO meike or §fVthe peasant cannot sell it at
all, he can ef_eourse make no finel settlement with the weaver. The
result of this is that the.weever is elee eeehle to pay the manu-
facturer of the machinery, ete.”7{»3'*°'* " '

Indeed, when a severance takes place between purchase and sale
in simple commodity economy, such severance will be limited to a nar-
row market sphere and will not spreaa generally. ' ‘

But the case is different unﬂer capitalism. Capitalism which
also transforms lebeurepewer into_a eemodity leads thereby to a gen-
eral development of cemmodity and money eeenemy. Capitalism develops
a colossal concentrationteflpreductisn which it conglomerates into
large and nerrewly speeielieed~eetesprises; -This is why all the in-
dependent eeonemie units (split up under—ee§ite1ism, by private prop-
erty and e fer«going divisien_ef‘lebeus) are closely tied.up with
each other so that any ene ef~theee eeenemie.usite is dependent upon
all the rest.’ A textile enterprise ﬂegends ﬁpen.e'eotton plantation
and e.mechine feetery, the meehiee faster? depenas ugon the blast
furnace work, the blast furﬁeee were tees the cellieries, etc., and
vice~versa. This is why the'geeeselLee»ebetrect (es Marx called it)

The Conflict and Disparity Between Production and Qonsumptign As An
Expression of The Chief_Contradiction In Capitalism,

We thus see that the contradiction between the social character

<of production and the capitalist fonm of appropriation, which forms

the chief cause of the crises, excesses itself in the conflict be—.
tween production and consunption,.cenitn1ism endows the contradiction
.between production and consumption, which also existed in pre~Capita1—
ist societies, s new and peculiar chnrncter.es a contradiction between
later and capitn1.. The crisisgfinds its_eXpression in the colossal_
intensification of this contradiction in_the sharp disparity between
production and consnnptiongwiihn.contradiction between production and
consumption always exists undericepitniisms .The intensification of.

.this contradiction and its.detelo went to the.point of explosion is

however, this disp?op@rti6nfn§.nn.o» eseien of the chief contradictions.

Marx has always stressed the ;7n éotion between these'two moments
and expressed the.visw that both the ﬁisﬁroportion and the contra-

And so, the contradiction between production and consumption in—
herent-in capitalism, which assumes the character of a contradiction
between capital and income, expresses itself eleo in the differences
of the parts of the socie1.pro&uction. This is why, as Lenin remarks:

."The power of consumption of society and the propoitionality
between the various hrenohee of nroanotion are not at all some
kind of independent eoneitione not connected with one another
(this, as we have eeengxielexeotly what the Socia1*Democrate can»
not grasp, -e'Editor§.’ On thepoontnefyg‘e certain etete of con-
suption is one of the7e1ementefefiyrhnortionelity." (Lenin,

According to Marx, crises are "always only momentary and violeﬁt
solutions of existing contradictions." (Marx, gspitsl, Vol. III)

Crises are the temporary forceful solution to the contradictions
upon which capitalism is based and which determines its development.
By dislocating the forces of production (through depreciation of
capital, fall in prices, dsstrction of commodities. and reduction
of output), and limiting proiucticn“the crisis again brings capital-
ist production, for a brief sysceg into accord wiih the narrow

It is perfectly clear, of course, that a large number of inven-
tions and improvements occurs just at times of crisis and_depression,
as it is at such~times of all others that competition between the
capitalists is fiercest. To atoid losses cr te check the fall in

"profits in the case of any drop in prices the eapitaiists lower their
costs of production, this being ﬁene in twe ways; first, by cutting
wages and intensifying labor; end eeeendly,~by perfecting the old
and introducing new improved.maehieery, iiegg by renewing their

"observed from the standpoint of capital, crises are thus
.most certainly see: to be moderating . . . though the matter’
looks quite different when we regard it from the viewpoint of
the mass of the population." (Ibid; p. 882.)

Kautsky goes on to elucidate the signifioence for capitalism of

o_any moderation of its crises, in that it would avoid any considerable

drop in prices. Naturally, under imperialism the consequences of the
destructive effects of crises are pushed on to the shoulders of the .
>working class to a greater exteﬁt tenfevertigfhet, however, was a

Va) Geherei Picture of the Crisissj

A crisis usually affects all spheres of csoitslist economy: in;

dustry and.commerce, hooks and stoek'exchanges, credit and circulation_

of money; in a word. all ports of capitalist economy are reouced to a
state of convulsion ﬁring s_crisis.o

A crisis is usually preceded.hy‘e'perioa.of boom in which there
is a steep rise in prcdnctiohtsfnll cohmoﬂities produced are sold
without difficulty and at prices.whﬁch ieeve s hig profit to the cap-
italists. The prices of shares c1imb_upwerds. In that era of fever-

ish boom it seems as though eves thing is for the best in the capital—;

ist world. Suﬂﬁenly the first 5‘ .stioh in the ﬂisposa1.of goods

sets in, which is fo11owed_by agcatastrophic fall in sales. It turns
’out that there is no dmanﬂ for the goons that had been producedi*;e
they lie in the warehouses es so mosh ﬁeed stock. As soon as the com-
modities cenhot be realiSe&;iﬁUm©ﬂ@?fthg ggpitalists begin to feel the

But ﬂﬁw tbs 8?? iS_ever§ohese: money alone is a commodity: As

Some Frank Talk
on McCarthyism

. A T IS WIDELY KNOWN that UE has stood-up — and in some ways
‘I grown stronger —- despite the most vicious red-baiting attacks from
‘labor-hating employers . . . ambitious politicians . . . |ab_or misleaders
. . . and newspaper propagandists.

Our Union has been attacked because we have done an effective
job for our members. The history of the American labor movement
shows that every ﬁghting union or union leader has been called an
”anarchist” or a ”bolshevik” or a ”communist.”

UE workers haveganswered the red-baiting with UE’s record and
UE’s program. We have exposed what red-baiting is: THE MAIN

lg“ WEAPON OF LABOR-HATING EMPLOYERS. Today, Senator McCarthy

has proven this point.

The whole nation — in fact the whole world — is recognizing the

frantic red-baiting of McCarthy as a COVER-UP for the graft and the ’

proﬁt grab of the big companies. While he shouts ”red” at every dissent-
ing voice, the companies grab the wealth of the nation.

I Almost every steward has personally felt the results of McCarthyism
his or her department: grievances unsettled; arrogance offoremen;
/illingness of companies to meet iustifiable demands of their em-
lees.

MCCARTHYISM IS MORE THAN A MAN. It is a symbol — as Hitler

a symbol — of danger to our entire democracy unless we unite

defeat it. This issue of the UE STEWARD is devoted to some frank
.a|_k about McCarthyism, and how to defeat it.

TheMTheoryyofuﬁnderabonguption

A tenﬁency to te obeerveﬁ in’SoeialeDemoeratic Literature on the
crises, the sowealleﬁitheory of undereconenmption; is not the less
adapted to the tasks of Sooialeﬁemocnatic pfaotice.

while the roots of the ﬁieyrogertibnality theory may be traced
back to the teaching of the ﬂshallowﬁ {as Marx called him) Say, who
develops the idea of the harmenyfofieepitaliet production and which
has already been riﬂdledrhy Eh? riﬁioule of Marx, the Social-Democratio
theory of underaeoneumption is Ent2a>eeeond_edition of the explanation
of crises as 6fenae&.by'theapettyj%@nrgeoiejeconomist Sismondi (1773
lsﬁa) ana later on eerveﬁ up afreeh ’ith a few alterations by Rodbertr
(1805~1875), an exlanation.wﬁighgﬁﬁeieimilarly refuted by Marx.

__ Siamonai took the yien¥tﬁe%7§§§i@éuée of the ciises was that con.

Now» although Mara regeatéﬁly ﬁiyéeéﬁ the fallacy yf the Sismon-
diam explanation of the crises;-tﬁeae ate yet such "thinkers" who not
only an not see the fundmental difference between the Marxian and
Siemondian_erieee theories, tut eyen represent the theory of Sismondi
and Rodbertue'as that of Marx; to-' ‘-‘,¥tm ‘

Karl Kauteky made e@me.attampts to aﬂjuet the crises theory of
Marx'to that of Siawanﬁi aaa=e@ateaeug in his earliest works. He tn»
wrote for instance; in the artiele on the crises theories already
quoted as follows: A ' ”-~e’¥=:Q” T ~ ‘

"The crises origiﬁe$e~; . . from underweonsumption." "Marx
and Engels also eonsiﬂered that the final cause of the crises
lay ; . . in undEr~eonsumption."'(ﬁ§§eﬂg§§§, 1902, Vol. II,

The explanatibn of crises by undér—¢cnsumpticn has, in recent
