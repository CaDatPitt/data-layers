 SETTLE Ar ANACONDA, ABC

READY TO BUST OPEN .  

 
 

  

 

 

 
 

' BUTTE, Mont. — International

president John Clark last week’

announced settlement of contract
negotiations with Anaconda Cop-
per Mining Co. in Montana for a
“package” totaling 201/; cents an
hour.

Clark, who is chairman of
Mine-Mill’s Anaconda Council,
made it clear that the Montana
agreement opens the way for
ABC locals in Torrington and
'Ansonia, Conn., and Buffalo,
N. Y., as well as Anaconda locals
in Tooele, Utah, Darwin and
Tecopa, California, and at East
Helena, Mont.

, Settlements on ‘the’ ; same basis A

as in Montana have already-been
reached with Anaconda subsidi-
aries in Arizona —- Inspiration
Copper and Int’l Smelting & Re-
fining—and similar offers have
been made at, Anaconda proper-
ties in Darwin, Tecopa, Tooele
and East Helena.

The agreement ‘reached by the
Montana Joint Negotiating Com-
mittee calls for across-the-board
wage increases of 8 cents an
hour, and provides for wage in-
creases of at least 10 cents an
hour for practically all the
workers.

The added wage increases are
provided for in reclassifications
averaging 7% cents an hour. The

‘pact also provides for 41/2 cents

an hour in a company-paid pen-
sion plan—which means the pen-
sion “break-through” in Ana-
conda has now been made.

The company also agreed to set
up an off-the-job accident and
sickness program under which it
will set aside $1 per man a month
into an insurance fund. In the
initial stages, this fund will pro-
vide $10.30 a week to any ACM
worker who becomes injured or
sick off the job, for a total of

x 26 weeks. As the fund is built

 

up, the benefits will be increased.

The agreement runs for . two
years, with a wage reopener on
June 30, 1952.

settlement Monday, November 5.
However, the agreement cannot
go into effect until it receives
approval from the Mine-Mill Na-
tional Wage Policy Committee
and the membership of the Ana-
conda Council.

Anaconda is the last of the.

“Big Four” giants in the non-
ferrous metals industry to reach
settlement with Mine-Mill this
year. Agreements were made
with Kennecott in August and
with Phelps-Dodge and American
Smelting & Refining Co. in Octo-
ber. The only major portion of
the industry which now remains
to be settled is in. the Coeur
d’Alenes, Idaho, where some 16
large independent ‘companies are
now engaging in district-wide
negotiations with Mine-Mill.

Members of the Montana Joint
N egotiating Committee, in addi-
tion to Clark, District 1 Execu-
tive Board Member William
Mason and Int’l representatives
Harlow Wildman and John Mc-
Leod, include:

Joe Mason, president‘ of Butte

Negotiations in Couer d'A|ene

district nearing ‘agreement

WALLACE, Idaho, Nov. 2-
Final agreement on an interim
district-wide settlement appears
close today. Pensions and im-
proved health and welfare bene-

fits are the principal issues still

to be ironed out.

Involved in these negotiations
are the three Mine-Mill local
unions of the Coeur d’Alene dis-
trict —Mullan Local 9, Wallace

Local 14 and Kellogg Local 18-— ‘

and the 18 operators with whom
they bargain. .

At the start of negotiations,
Local 9 was" not a part of /the

Mine-Mill Joint Negotiating Com--

mittee. This was the result of

disruptive conduct on the part of
officers of that local, leading to
their removal by International
President Clark. Now all three
locals are combined in the Joint
Committee. Administrator Ernest
Salvas and Ken Smith, a leading
member of Local 9, now repre-
sent that local in the negotia-
tions, which are led by Int’l rep.
Rudy Hanson. . ,
A meeting is scheduled for this
evening in Mullan, at which Sal-
vas and Smith will report on the

progress of ~ negotiations. _Also,_
. plans will be made for participa-

tion of the Local 9 members in
Monday’s referendum.

When the former officers of
Local 9 refused to respect the.
action of President Clark in re-

moving them from office, a tem-

porary restraining order‘ was ob-
tained through the District Court
here by Board Member Chase
Powers. A hearing on the union's
motion to make the order per-
manent will be held here Novem-
ber 9, with President Clark pres-
ent to speak for the International
Union. The temporary order
prohibits the former officers
from acting _in any capacity 5‘ as
representatives of Mine-Mill or
Local 9_.

Greeks elect ‘I1 '
anﬁ-fascists-
'I'hey're in jail

" ATHENS, Greece—Eleven men were

" -«elected to the Greek Parliament Sep-

' tember 9 who are in jail or exile. These
are not criminals; they are political
prisoners—men who have fought the

present monarchist government of.

Greece.— A - .

They are men who fought the Nazis
during their occupation of Greece. They
include ‘Manolis Glezos, who was sen-
tenced to death by the Nazis for tear-
ing down the Swastika from the Acro-

polis, an act which sparked" the resist-. ,

ance. They include Tony Ambatielos,

former secretary-general of the Fed- .

eration of'Greek Maritime Unions (out-
lawed), who has -been in prison since
1947 ; Generals Serafis and. H-adjimi-
chalis of “Elas,” Greek -army of re-
sistance; Manolis Glezos, a journalist;
-Professor John Imvriotis; and I. Gav-
rilides, secretary of the Agrarian
Party.

‘ ,‘Greek courts so far have confirmed
the election of eight-of these prisoners.
Article , 63 of the Greek Constitution
states that “if a Member of Parliament
is under personal arrest, he is to be
freed without delay four weeks before
the start of the session.” _

But all of them still are in jail ‘or
exile. Manolis Glezos has -begun a hun-
ger .strike, despite his affliction with
tuberculosis.

_A protest movement against con-
tinued imprisonment of these men, de-
nial of the seats in Parliament to
which they were elected and violation
of the will of the Greek pcople is de-
veloping in Britain. .

De-mocra-tic Greeks are afraid that
these MP’s never will be freed unless
as" a result of widespread pressure
from other countries._Pressure is espe-
cia'l-ly effective from Britain -and the
United States, the two powers that im-
posed the present Greek government
upon that country, and maintain it in
power. -

Protests may be directed to Premier‘

Sophocles Venezelos, Athens, Greece.

By John Clark
Whenpour union launched its bargaining campaign this year, we
recognizedthat we had two hurdles between us and our goal: first, to
reach acceptable agreements with the employers; second, to get these
approved by the Wage Stabilization Board. r .

We knew that neither’ would be easy.. There were many who pre- _

dicted that both would prove ifn-possible.

We have taken the first step. In the Big Four of the industry,
; ’ V" and -in many other plants, we have won the best

      
   
 
   
  

those places where final agreement had not been
reached’ at press time for'THE UNION, it Is ex-
pected soon.

, The first hurdle was not easy. It required
‘long, careful planning, coordination of all sections
_ f the union, disciplined action in carrying out
decisions, and finally a strong, nation-wide strike.

The second hurdle will be no easier. The Wage
Stabilization Board was not set up for the purpose of approving wage
increases. It was set up to administer a wage freeze. It is only to the
extent we apply heat to the freeze that we can win approval of the

increases we have negotiated. . ’ -

- ﬁr 79: 7!‘:

THIS SHOULD BE the number one job of the ’_union *now—-"
to make sure that our needs and oup determination are known to the
Wage Stabilization Board, jhe “Economic Stabilizer,” and the Presi-
dent.

.Articles in this issue of THE UNION on taxes ‘and on amendments
to the “Defense Production Act”, make it clear that Congress has
legislated to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. Only protection
for he workingrnang-—.and for that famous “American standard of
livi.ng”—is a union with the militancy and courage‘ to win contract
gains AND TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE APPROVED.

it it 7.’:

 
 

settlements achieved by any union this year. In.

The Wage Stabilization Board is under pressure from- every reaction- .

ary fqrce in the country to keep therwage freeze solid. This pressure
is very strong. The newspapers and radio commentators serve as its
mouthpieces. This is a pressure to lower the standard of living of the
American worker while his employer makes profits higher than he
even dreamed of a few years ago. '

The Board and the government must, feel the demand of -the
workers in our industry, in our union, that we are entitled to the
benefits we have negotiated and we intend to have them.

That second hurdlefis ahead of us. Let’s take it.

  Trail localofficers protest

against. Canadian border bar

TRAIL, B. C.——Canada’s minister of -

external affairs has ‘been served no-
tice by Mine-Mill Local 480 that the
time has come to call a halt to the
practice of barring Canadian citizens
at the U. S. border. V

The notice tookthe form of a sharp- I

ly-worded letter from'the top officers
of Local 480 to Lester Pearson, the
Dean Acheson‘ of Canada, as the open-
ing gun, in Mine-Mill’s campaign to
open up the border so that trade union

-members can pass freely back and

forth. _
The campaign was initiated at the

Noga-les Mine-Mill convention in Sep--
tember, after the Canadian authorities“

had refused to- permit the‘ majority of
Canadian delegates to enter the states
in order to attend their union’.s annual
convention.

“IT IS TIME to call stop to this
damnable outrage,” said the letter

Picker 19 weeks I
LA strikers lined,
jailed for contempt

LOS ANGELES, Calif.—Die. cast
strikers, now in their 19th week on the
picket lines, last week were aroused

’ over a Superior Court Judge's decision
’ sentencing 14 rank—and—file members

and officers of Mine-Mill Local 700"to
jail for one to five days and levying
fines of $10 to $100.

It was the largest group of union
workers ever sentenced in Los Angeles
for contempt in a union case. Judge
William S. Baird ruled that the pickets
and their union leaders were guilty of
contempt of a court order—issued last
summer——r'estr-icting picketing at An-
derson Diecast Company.

Jack Marcotti, executive secretary of
Local' 700, charged that the Judge
Zaird -penalties were a “pnecedent di-

rected at all organized labor” in the‘

Los Angeles area. Strike leaders made
clear that they would appeal the con-
victions, on which the judge granted a
.7 -day -stay of execution.

UNION OFFICIALS insisted, that
the‘ “case”
charged with having violated the in-
junction, was based on perjury. Ma-r-
cotti said the Anderson .picke'ts‘ had
been careful from the ‘beginning to
conform to the injunction terms.

The heaviest sentences were levied
against Estelle Parness, of Los An-

geles Diecast, and Dan Chi‘ldr=ess, A_-n-1- . ‘ V
derson picket ca.ptain. ‘Both were sen-A

tenced._to 5 days in jail and given $100
fines. The Judge told Sister Par-‘ness

that -if she failed to pay the fine she‘

would have to “work it out” in jail at
the rate of $5 a day—20 days.

Marcotti was fined $50 and sentenced I
to two days in jail. I.nt’.l. rep. Warren-

Horie, also charged with contempt, was
dismissed. ' ' «

Others who were sentenced included:
Paul Childress, picket captain, $50 and
three‘ days in jail; Clyde Sadler, $25‘;
Bob Wilson, $15 and two days; Myrtle
Nigh, in" charge of ﬁche strike soup
kitchen, $10 and one day.

- Also sentenced or fined were -Local

steward Edward . Carroll,
Hill, «Minnie William , Chester Blevins,
Frank Harvey and Goldie Carr. These
seven were ordered either -to pay :$10
fines or spend two days in jail.

Diecast leaders pointed out that the

new attack on their strike would mean” - ’
need for more fina__nci‘al aid than ever '
since, in addition to the ordinary .strike, '1’
relief needs, there will be the cost. of

a court battle. ‘Contributions ‘should be

ABC confrdcf gains

exceed zoac‘ an hour

‘ ANSON IA, Conn.—Settlement

' of" contract negotiations with

American Brass Company last
Friday meant that Mine-Mill had
virtually wrapped up its 1951
bargaining with Anaconda" across
the country. '

The settlement, announced by
ABC coordinator Irving Dichter,
who headed up Mine-Mill’s nego-
tiating team, called for gains in
excess of 201/2 cents an hour.

It called for an 8 cent general
wage increase as well as 5 cents
in reclassification boosts forall

skilled trandesmen and all powerhouse
and boiler room workers.

IT PROVIDED for a pen_sion‘plan

identical with the one negotiated in C

~Montana with Anaconda, which was es-
timated at 41/: cents an hour in value.
However, the ABC pension program in
brass“ was, expected to -be somewhat
more ‘costly since there are already
more than 300 men in the Ansonia plant
alone who are immediately eligible for
pension since they are 65 years of age
and have 25 years’ seniority.

' The pact also called for an insur-
ance program believed worth more than

.7 cents an hour. This program provides

sick benefits of $30 a week for 26
weeks; hospitalization for employees
and their families at the rate of $9 a
day for 70 days; full reimbursement for
special hospital services. for 21 days

- ‘andpartial reimbursement for an1ad-
- . ditional 49 days; maternity hospit—ali- . .

-zation of $9 a day plus special services

. up t_o‘$100; surgical benefits up to $250,

and ‘comprehensive insurance .of $4,000

portant non-economic benefits, includ-
ing improvements in seniority rights
‘and in protection against speedup.

There will be minor differences be-
tween the insurance package in Buf-.
falo and the one in Connecticut because

1 BAYARD, N. M.—Raiding steel
payrollers, “vultures of the labor‘

movement,” have moved in here in the 9
hope of breaking the Empire Zinc

strike so they can pick up the pieces. _ 1

_ The strike now is in its second year.
October 17 marked the anniversary -of_
this ‘history-making battle between-
union-busting New Jersey Zinc Com- ‘
pany (parent firm) and. a group of 90
strikers who, with" their wives and’

families and -with the support of the ’

other members of Mine-Mill Local -.890,»
will not have their union or their
strike broken. ' -

Meantime, Local 890 is preparing to‘ ' 1

test the right to appeal peace bonds in_

the case of Vincente Becerra, one of 

the negotiating committee of the Em-
pire Zinc strikers. Bacerra has been
held in_the Grant County jail since Sat-

post a peace bond of $500.

The union’s attorney, David. Serna,'ii
expects to file‘ a motion to‘ appeal the‘, '‘

entire case to district court.
“VINCENTE BACERRA has decided ’

'I

vurday, October. 20, ‘when he failed to  if

to fight the indiscriminate use of peace ' 71

bonds, as practiced in Grant County in
connection with the’ Empire Zinc
strike,” said one union leader. “Up. to

now if a peace bond defendant was un- V ‘

able or unwilling to po’st the required
bond, that person was compelled to,
stay in jail indefinitely. He had no‘ ap-
peal whatever. This is the 20th’ century,

not the era of feudal barons, who threw "

theirserfs into prison to languish.”
Bacerra, a veteran and father of two

children, with a third expected next

month, said-: “I will not post a peace

bond since I am a peaceable person, “

who never threatened or harmed any-
'one. If I can be arrested and sentenced
for being close to the .picket line at.

HEN you’ pick up your next pay envelope

take a good look at what’s inside. Unless
you put in some extra overtime this week, it’s
going to be thinner than the last one.

It’ll buy fewer pork chops, less milk for the

H" kids. The-cut may mean you’ll have t0 SW13 8°-

ing to the movie once a week.

For the new “bite” on your pay, which Went
into effect November 1, you can thank Congress.

' But when”Congress enacted its new‘ tax bill,
it didn't only cut down on your family’s pork

_chops and milk: It also, raised the price of a

gallon of gas, a glass of beer, a pack of cigarets,
a dozen household appliances——like electric irons
and clothes-driers—a Ford or a Chevvy.

CONGRESS DIDN'T FOOL around when it
came to hitting you where it hurt—and hitting
hard. But it was gentle as a summer breeze
when it came to the big guys. They got “special”
treatment which means the new tax bill hardly
touches them. .

The tax bite on your next pay envelope will

be nearly 12 per cent higher than the bite on the

last one. It won’t go up nearly that much for
the biggie earning $10,000 a year, or $25,000, or
$100,000. As a matter of fact, for the $100,000-
a-year man, taxes go up only about 4'/2 per cent.

What’s« more, those whose income tops $25,-

000 a year are awarded with_a “special” feature ‘

in the new tax law which lets them compute their
taxes in a different way than you must figure it

, —and thereby save money you can’t save.

Even President Truman, who asked for the

(bill in the first place and who signed it into law
' within hours after Congress passed it, complained

that it opens new loopholes‘for the rich instead
of closing old ones. ' -

The President forgot to mention that ‘the law

contained no increase in excess profits taxes—- --
now scandalously low when you consider how.

scandalously high the profits are.

And the Presid.ent’s agents in the Office of
Price Stabilization are making sure that the new-

ly increased taxes on cigarets, beer, autos,;sport- '

ing goods, lawnmowers and other items give
wholesalers and retailers a new chance to prof-
iteer.' ‘ ' ' /_

' An OPS spokesman admits that the new reg-
ulations Will allow dealers to boost prices more
than the increased taxes, In most cases, instead
of simply adding the new tax to the sale price,
dealers will be allowed to add the new taxes‘ to
their own cost prices before making their unsual

markups. .This will pyramid the price increase,

beyond the actual amount of the taxes.

“What’s behind all this?

THE CONGRESSMEN and members of the
Truman Administration justify the great in-
creases in taxes on workers on the basis that
it drains off “excess”_ money in their pockets,
which is “inflationary.” V

_No worker needs to be told, of course, that

Nirzﬁv

/

lived happllyever after." ‘xx ‘

he'doesn’t have any “excess” money. But it
might be a good idea to‘ look at some facts just
uncovered by Theodore Kreps, former head of
the staff of the» Senate-‘House economic\com-
mittee:

. 1.. ms the top fifth. of American families
and individuals received nearly half the income
ingthis country.

a. The bottom fifth got onlys:*.l.2 percent of

the total annual income.

0 The top two-fifths got 69.22: per cent and
the bottom two-fifths got 14.?’ per cent.

Thosefigures make it pretty clear where most
of the new taxes should come-from. And it
doesn’t take any figuring to understand that the
man‘ who gets 25 grand a year “can more easily
pay.12 per cent more in taxes than the worker
who gets $2,500 or even $4,000. And by far the
largest part of the population earns less than
$4,000 a year. '

-But Kreps has more to say. He reports that
the average American pays something like 25
per cent of his income in federal, state and local
taxes. The bottom bracket pays 23.6-per cent of
their income, while the top brackets pay 31.7 per
cent of their income. Again, anyone can see
that the top brackets have a much greaterability
to pay higher taxes. .

And the tax expert demolishes the foolish no-
tionéthat lower income groups must be taxed to
avoid inflation. ' _

“Most of the spending is not _done by the
masses/’. he says. “They just don’t have enough
income. In 1948, only 13 per cent of all con-

.sumer expenditures were made by the 33 per cent

of our people with income under $2,000.‘

‘(But 34 per cent of total consumer purchases

I were made by the 16 per cent of people with in- _

comes over $5,000.”

The Longshoremen’s'. & Warehouseman’s pa-

‘per, The Dispatcher, explains very simply the

why and wherefore of the new taxes:

“The extra tan: gag for ‘defense’-—Jwhich is
where most of our money goes.

“The reason they want to defend us so badly‘

is that the additional taxes ‘for defense’ go into ‘

the pockets of the ‘defense’ industries in" terms
of profits for -war machinery. ‘What could be
easier to understand. . i

C “You could also make an equation out of it. ‘
War scares equal higher taxes’ equal greater
profits.” ~

.7/.. $16 4.-//~.,. ;4.,..,../../ €..o..z..z;

WHEN Congress recessedffor the remainder

of this year, atypical reaction from a work-
ing man was “Well, they can’t hit us with any-
thing more for a couple of months.” '

There was not only the new tax bill that hit us.
Earlier (July 31), there had ’ been something

.called the “Amended Controls Law”—amend-

inputs to the Defense Production Act of 1950.,

In the name of “National Defense,” this law
perpetrates a fraud pn the working people of this
country. All of these amendments weaken still
further controls over prices,’ rents and profits.

Stringent controls on wages, however, continue..

Big Business does this very cleverly. ‘In or-
der to fool the people, a law to control wages
must pretend to control prices. Since this pre.

-tense admittedly won't work, they generously

provide for wage increases to match increases in
the so-called cost of living.‘ But they are careful
to use the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Index

about 50 pervcent. \ »

which runderstates ‘cost of living , increases by

1- ‘ Under this clever set—up prices are bound to
rise faster than wages. ‘

THE ORIGINAL. ACT prohibited control over
agricultural prices until the parity price was

exceeded. Since parity prices automatically rise '
with industrial prices, this eliminated one large

area from effective price control. . e

. As a result of this and similar provisions there’
was little control oflfood prices, which speedily

rose 2 percent in the year ending June, 1951,

., according to the inadequate Bureau of Labor Sta- V

tistics Index.

‘FAIR DEAL’_

Congresslnan Drip

I “l haie.1his- election season, when you have
to start being niceto people." ‘

, UN CHAN GED in the Act is the provision that
when this utterly fraudulent and meaningless
price control program is. begun, wage control
must also be started. The wage coptrol provi-
sions, entirely unlike the price control provisions,
are extremely stringent. ' ’

These wage controls, however, are not em-
bodied in the Act itself, but are in the regula-

tions issued by the WSB. These regulations set '-

up a facade of seeming fairness and flexibility,
but the reality is quite the opposite. .Instead of

stabilization, we have a deliberate policy of wor-
sening the real standard of. l1V11‘lg of the work-

» ers: ,This is accomplished: —

0 By trying to tie wages to the phony BLS Con-
sumers’ Price Index which grossly understates
_, the increase in the cost of living, and

0' By using a deliberate policy of delay and pro-

crastination in permitting and approving wage _

increases. ,
ANYONE still unconvinced that this controls

. law is akfraud against workers, might ’do well

to examine the WSB policy on salary increases.

As the US. News and World Report summarized I

on August 24:

.“Salary controls, under rules being laid down,
leave room to expand. There’ is more than one‘
way to give apay increase.

‘:‘S'tock-option plans are expected to get Gov- -.

ernment approval. This will permit indirect

-praises for executives and others. ~ .

“Bonuses may be paid as inﬂthe past. Merit

increases will, continue. Here are some ways em- .

players can raise salaries :”

Then they proceed to give details. The.‘ net
effect is that executives have many ways of giv-
ing themselves increases. The stock-option gim-
mick works this way. A $100,000-a-year execu-
tive is given an option to buy 1,000 shares of the

_ corporation’s stock at-$50 a,share. The market7

price, of the-stock is $100 a share. So our for-;

,tunate executive bu\ys—-and later sells—and pock-
-ets $50,000 in clear profit. But his good fortune V
does not stop there. .Under the Revenue Act of '
1950, he pays ‘only a $12,500 capital gain tax’ .

on this extra $50,000, instead-‘of a‘ $40,000 tax if

.it‘were considered as ordinary income.

TAKE THE -S'I'I‘.UATION'.in a typical mine“

-or plant. The works’ ability to raisetheir wages,

is limited by what they induce the WSB to ap-

, prove. The boss’s prices and profits, however,

are not subject to any controls. When the worker
goes (to spend his pay the price of everything

he buys is uncontrolled. When he gets his wages.

a, big bite is taken out in withholding taxes to
pay the exorbitant prices his boss charges the
government under the war contracts. The boss
can raise his salary pretty much as he pleases.

There. is no withholding tax on dividends paid to ._

We attended the first sessions of the UAW-CIO panel hearing

_involving some of the brass fabricating plants in the Midwest and   9

Connecticut, aswell as one in Alabama. » V. ;

After the formal opening by the chairman of the Board, Nathan
Feinsinger, the announcement was made that the cases would be
heard by another division of the board.

At this rate thecases will not be concluded for several‘ we"eks._
Then the panel (composed of labor, industry and public members); ’
will make its report to the full Board." The full Board will then make - A
public the recommendations to’ the President of ' the United States.

Based on the experiences with cases before the Board so'far, it’s
doubtful whether the United Auto Workers’ membership will get a de-  ]
cision until after the first of the year, unless Mine-Mill comes up with A
an Anaconda settlement in ABC. This appears likely and no doubtwill . P V _
give the UAW some break on the elapsed time for their settlement. . ' 5

There were a couple of interesting side lights during. the hearing.
‘The chief ‘spokesman for UAW, an executive board member from
Detroit, pointed out that the Wolverine Tube Division of the Calumet
Hecla Company ‘refused .to rehire over 300 workers who were on strike
at the Decatur, Alabama, plant. The UAW had sentvthese men back V . ,
to work after they agreed to the President’s "request that the case ' ‘ 
be certified to the.Board. ’ ‘ ' ~
But the Company refused to rehire these men. The UAW right-
fully demanded that the Board request the company-to rehire these
men before the cases proceeded. The UAW pointed out that the Board , .'
would not hear the ‘case the previous week until. they had sent the ‘
workers back to work at the Mueller plant in the Midwest. ' . ’
The UAW executive board member stated that the Mine, Mill &'
Smelter Workers union got an injunction when they would not acede

' to theAPresident’s request to take the case before WSB. He further,
asked that the government take away from this plant any govern-

mental contracts‘ if the company would not rehire the strikers. » ’
The Board delayed the hearing and recessed for about two hours '

to’ made a decision. . ' I '
~When they returned, they announced they would take no im-.

_ mediate action but they wouldrproceedwith the case and ‘would hear , _ H J

anything the union had to say on any matter; — A . ’ .. .;
We have already indicated how long a decision would have to take‘ ' S‘ . ‘ 'd
on any matter before WSB. -  A ‘
So that when" we find a situation where a union strikes, the
Board will not proceed. But. when a company strikes, it’s another
matter. ’ 1 u .
' We had hoped that the UAW would protest this procedure by

the Board, but unfortunately they did not. _
Anyway, this is what they call “Equal treatment under the law," -

WALLACE, ‘Idaho — Herein the
Coeur d’Alene mining district, free
speech is not for working peop1e—I10t
unless ‘they fight for it, There‘ is a
lead-ziiic-silver curtain surrounding the
City Auditorium of Wallace, and throw-
ing a shadow across every evenue ‘of
communication. _ _
The most recent issue was whether

i _ Harry ‘Bridges could speak here, in the

only two halls of any size. Last sum-
mer, it was whether a memberoof Mine-
Mill could tell what he saw on a trip
to Europe. «

The Coeur d’Alene
miners, with the
help of other union-
ists in the North-
west, accepted an in-
vitation from Euro-
pean, trade union
federations to send

l

with a visiting »dele— '
gation. They sent

Blackwell .
Mine-Mill Northwest "Council. _
SINCE THE COUNTRIES to be vis-

ited included some of both “East” and
”West,” the miners were careful to se-

‘is chairman of the

' lect for the trip a man who was known

more for honesty and frankness than
for being identified with either left
or right in his political opinions.
Blackwell .made the trip last June
and July, visiting Italy, France, Po-
land, the Soviet Union, Austria and
Czechoslovakia. Upon his return, he
took part in a broadcast via KWAL at
nearby Osburn. It was a -question-and-
answer program dealing with what he
had seen and heard abroad, principal-

‘ ly with living and working conditions.

Questions asked in the broadcast

, were those Blackwell had heard most

frequently in p ri v a t e conversation

_since his return. Many persons have

been skeptical of .-his replies, because
his observations do not confirm their

7 previous impressions. This is particu-

larlyﬂtrue concerning the Soviet Union.

But Jack is "not a man to back down
or to get belligerent.
“This is what I saw and heard.”

A STORM of controversy followed
the broadcast. There were many who
said Jack’s report was “too favorable”
to the Soviet Union. The line-up in this

I dispute quickly became apparent. The

leadership -of the Kellogg and Wallace
locals, and almost‘ all of the member-
ship, took the position that they trust-'
ed Jack’s honesty, they wanted to hear
his report and make up their own minds
as to what they thought of it.

.On the other hand, the traditional

Below are some excerpts from the’
pamphlet “U. S. LABOR LOOKS AT
EUROPE." This report aroused "much

‘ interest on the part of delegates to

the Mine-Mill convention this year.
It was presented by John Blackwell,
recording secretary of Wallace ( Idaho )
Miners Union, Local 14. Although
Blackwell was scheduled for only a
few minutes on the convention plat-
form to make a brief report on his
trip, delegates insisted’ by una-nimous

. vote that they wanted to hear ‘every

word of it. . '

HE TRADE UNION delegation. that
visited Europe in July, 1951-, was
composed of representatives crf-‘workers
in AFL, CIO, and independent unions
from coast to coast. They . . . repre-
sented a wide variety of political opin-

ions.

_ The delegation spent five weeks
in Europe -and visited France, Italy,
Poland and the Soviet Union. In ad-
dition . . . a limited time in Berlin,
Vienna and Prague . . .‘In each coun-

,try, we were invited by the leading

enemies’ of Mine-Mill seized ....... the»

Blackwell report as a club to beat t_he
union. These included employers, some
anti-labor local businessmen,
handful of disrupters in the Mullan

._’ local—the, same characters who refused
to conduct a strike vote _or to join in
the nation-‘wide Mine-Mill strike this
year.

This outcry fed upon the national
hysteria and raised it to new levels
of insanity. A typical example of the
witch-hunting spirit whipped up here
was this: A high school boy by the
name of Blackwell (not related to J ack)

was greeted by boos when introduced
as ‘a contestant in a boxing match.
With negotiationsrunder sway, the
employers decided they had been hand-
ed a goodweapon to use in fighting
the union’s wage demands. They organ-
ized‘ an f‘Anti-Communist’Week.” ‘They
had a Sunday parade, led by the may-

ors of the three larger towns in the dis- _ -

It was during this period that Wal-
lace Local 14 applied -to their city
council for use of .the »city’s auditorium
for ameeting to “hear Blackwell's re-
port. Arrangements were made, and a
meeting scheduled. Then, on short no-

were not wanted in the

tice, the council reversed its position ‘

and refused the hall to the union. The
same thing happened with the Eagles’
hall. -

Now time was short.
for the meetingfwas just one day off.
It was decided to use Local '18’s hall
in Kellogg, though it "is not large. Lo-
cal newspapers were asked to carry
announcements. They refused. The
,area’s one radio/ station was asked to
put on a series of spot announcements.
This was refused, though the local
unions are regular customers for radio
time.‘ , .

, ‘East action was calledfor. Thousands

of leaflets were run off, announcing the
new meeting place.
‘members took them house-to.-house in
every town of the district.

One of the -members owns an air-
plane. He flew over each of the towns,
dropping more thousands of leaflets.

THE MEETING was a great success.
A big overflow crowd heard Blackwell
through a loudspeaker outside the hall.

drama came in September, upon re-
turn of delegates from the -Mine-Mill
Convention.

delegates—Montana, Idaho and Wash-
ington—asked the two to make a
speaking tour of their local unions.
This was arranged.

The Wallace delegates made an
appointment ‘with the councilmanic
committee responsible for the City

Auditorium. They first inquired‘

whether it was now city policy to deny
use of _the hall to the union.

Most of the talking for the council’s
auditorium committee was done by
S. F. _I-Ieitfeld, -who is secretary-
tl°easu1'er of Day Mining Company.
Mr. Héitfeld replied warily to the
union that there was no policy of deny-
ing anything, BUT--what kind of
meeting? .' -

‘A meeting to hear guest speakers,
he was told.

The councilmen flatly refused an
answer until informed who" the speak-
ers would be. As. soon as they heard
Bridges’ ‘name, they looked horrified

and" said no. The building is a memo- ‘

rial to war veterans, said Heitfeld, and
Bridges’ presence would “desecrate” it.
“Why?” , ‘
.“Because Bridges has been accused
of being a Communist.” _ , _
“Many people have been called Com-
munists. Senator McCarthy says just
about everyone but himself is a Com-

asked to bring back was that of peace.

WE SPENT MOST of our time in
the Soviet Union ‘because it has become

Dear Brother. Travis:

I would like to take this opportunity,
in behalf of the Executive Board‘ of
Local 365, to thank you" for the splen-
did job you did at negotiations here at
Perth Amboy.

The membership ‘had a meeting Wed-
nesday, October 17th and voted by an
overwhelming majority to _accept the
national AS&R package.

I would also like to inform you that
the Executive Board, Stewards Coun-
cil and membership of Local 365 voted
to support all of the four national of-
ficers for re-election. We feel that the
same team that carried out national

-negotiations and‘ a national strike

should be returned to "office to lead the

.fight in cracking through the Wage

Stabilization Board. We feel that by
returning all the officers to office, we
will be able to keep the marvelous unity
that we achievedvfor the first time
this year.

The Executive Board has instructed
me to write this letter _and to send
copies _of this letter to all other AS&R
locals. We feel that the need for unity
is so strong that we would like to do
our part in this matter.

THOMAS LANE, president,
Local 365, ._

V-icil-ory at Roysi-er
To the Editor: ,
Mine—Mill Local 863 won a «great vic-

rtory at F. S. Royster plant, Charleston,

S. C. The committees won a grievance
for five wo.rkers who were sent home
because a machine broke down. ‘The
employer over-looked the s e n ivo r i t y
clause in the contract.

As a. result of this victory, the work-
ers received a total of 60 hours in back
pay—12.hours each. Ten other work-
ers got 45 minutes over-time pay that

lphadybeen deducted from them .for at-
.tending a plant meeting. These two.

settlements put a lot of strength and
courage in other shop stewards through-
out our local. Thank’s to» Royster’-s

a proposed by Thibauﬂ

TORONTO, Ont.—-A conference of
delegates from Mine-Mill, UE, and Fur
& Leather locals in Canada was pro-
posed here recently by Nels Thibault,
Mine-Mill regional director in eastern

v Canada.

Thibault, who is unopposed as can-
didate for Mine-Mill executive board
member in District 18., -made his sug-
gestion in a speech before the Cana-
dian district convention of the ‘United
Electrical Radio & Machine Workers
(UE).

The parley would lay the ground-
work for a joint ‘call to all Canadian
trade unionists ‘around an action pro-
gram to restore living standards in
Canada, Thibault said.

A favorable initial reaction to Thi-
bault’s plan was indicated by the UE
convention resolution on bargaining
which categorically rejected “the posi-
tion that our members must accept re-
ductions in our living standards. Cor-
poration profits stand at an‘ all-time
high and continue to soar; productivity
of labor per inanhour. has reached un-
precedented proportions.” '

 Soinotlriilg new cookillg  

on tlu-. liroeclcnn. Trail]!

By Rod Holmgren

CINCINNATI, Ohio — “Something;
new is cooking on the Freedom Train!
 That’s the way William Hood, record-

’ ing secretary of the giant UAW Ford

Local 600, put it in his opening ad-
dress to the founding conference of the
National Negro Labor Council. _

, Looking around at the sea of intent,
eager faces — more than a thousand
strong--you had a feeling that this
meeting marked the beginning of a new
stage in the surge of the Negro peo-

_ pies A toward freedom.

“We come to announce to all Amer-

C ica and to the world, that Uncle Tom

is dead,” said the fiery leader of 65,000
And you knew there
was ‘deep meaning Lbeliind his announce-
ment. ._

THEY ‘CAME from every corner of
the_land—-the most militant, progress-
ive, farsighted workers in the labor
movement. Four-fifths of them were
Negroes, but there were easily enough
white trade unions—rank and filers and
leaders I-— to make it'clear that this
movement’ had solid roots in the. tree-
of Negro,-white unity. _

_.They h_ad chosen,Cincinnat.i as their
meeting place because this was oncean
important way-station in the Under-

— ground Railroad over which Negroes

travelled in their dash for freedom be-.
fore the Civil War.
; By their coming, many of them de-

I tied the demands of top officialsein
- their unions, asin CIO Steel and CIO-

UAW, which had tried hard. to smear
the conference as “dual unionism,” and
ordered their members to stay away.

'_ Hood, who at the close of the meet-
ing was elected president of the" new
Council, was cheered mightily when he
said: “Negro America is mad, hurt and
humiliated. We,jyoui-«black sons and
daughters, pledge to youthat we have a
pool of mighty strength to put at your
service, to the end that you will have
economic, political and social equality,

so that you might enjoy the great and
» good things of our land. v ’

_ “The world must understand that we
intend to build a stronger bond of unity
between black and white workers every-

vwhere to strengthen American democ-

racy for all. If this be subversion-
make the most of it.”

‘ , Making it clear that this new organ-

lzation of Negro workers has no inten-
tion of displacing other Negro organi-
zations, the delegates pointed out that
since “our, primary, and immediate
mission is the achievement of economic
equality for the Negro people, it fol-
lows naturally that the overriding
theme of our program should be a
concrete, measurable and down-to-
earth fight for jobs for Negro Ameri-
cans," new jobs and better jobs, with
higher pay and betterworking condi-
tions and without discrimination.” V
Speaking for thewhite trade union-
lsts at the parley, Maurice Travis, Mine-
Mill secretary-treasurer, urged‘ white

workers to join more fully in the fight .

, WASHINGTON — Defense “Mobili-

General. Electric Corp.,'has retreated

labor movement is concerned.

would have to be raised-' to 44 or 46

Mine-Mill was one of the first unions

to attack the Wilson “no overtime"
- roposal. The International Executive ,

oard, in a policy" statement issued
back in February, hit hard at Wilson,
pointing out that long before he be-

1 for Negro rights—to campaign among

white workers in their communities and
their unions for Negro-white unity.
“THE RESPONSIBILITY of white
workers here is to guarantee that white
workers be brought into the united
struggle with Negro workers for Ne-
gro rights,” said Travis. “Unless they

. do that, the white labor leaders will
‘have forfeited the right to speak of
‘Negro-white unity.”

“The fight for Negro rights is not a
matter of big brotherhood, or paternal-
ism, or generosity on the part of white
workers themselves.

“When the employers . . . impose a
wage freeze, the freeze does_not dis-
tinguish between white workers and
Negroes. It does not say: ‘We will hold
down the wages of one group and raise
the wages of the other.’ No——-it says
this wage freeze is democratic-—every-
body is frozen stiff as a mackerel!”

But the two-day session was far more
than speeches. The delegates went
away with the kind of actiomprogram
they wa'nted—with the kind of targets
that are big but canhbe reached with
real effort.. They kept ‘the program

simple, with two main points right at

the top: ' _

QA campaign to collect 1,000,000
signatures by May, 1952, on a petition
to President Truman demanding that
he issue an Executive order setting
up a Fair Employment Practices Com-
m'ission.~. ‘ » _' , .

Q A nationwide fight for a minimum
of 100,000 new jobs in the industries,
shops, departments, offices, crafts,
skilled trades and government employ-

ment which now deny equal opportu- ‘

nities for Negro workers.
The resolutions and action program

. proposed that the job campaign center

around three key aims: “jobs for Ne-
gro women, cracking lily-white shops
and a general _fight for upgrading
throughout iI_idustry.’_’ -

MEDICINE HAT, Alta.-—A three-

point program to save the _ Western-
"Canadian pottery industry from ruin
' and to simultaneously aid in increas-

ing wages has been offered to the Ca-
nadian minister of mines and re-

. sources by Mine"-Mill’s Gas City Pot-
tery and Clay_Workers Local’ 895 here. i

The programthas been offered, the
union,told -the ministry, .be,caiis.e “the

__ pottery ’industry'is today in the posi-

tion’ whereby it is only able to continue
operations through the workers sub-

sidizing it, by the receipt of sub-.W

standard wages-—-wages that are to-

tally inadequate to meet the infla-

tionary price trends now existing.’_’

The program offered‘ the government
by Local. 895 includes these three’
points: ' - .

1.'That the industry be protected
against unfair‘ foreign, competition.

2. That’ government contracts to the
industry be awarded with. a view" to

ensuring the .payment of adequate ’
, wages, and the continuance of opera-
tion of established plants in the in-

dustry. ,

On point one,_the union offered evi-

dence to prove that United States for-
eign policy is responsible for consid-
erable of the. plight facing Medicine
Hat. In its brief to the ministry, the
local, points out that competing Japa-
nese pottery, subsidized by. the United’

. States, can be_sold cheaper ‘in Canada
than similar Canadian ware. Says the -
union brief: ,

‘ “It would appear as if Canadian
markets are being used to. enable the

, United States to recover ‘part of the
money they are pouring into Japan,
at the expense of Canadian industry,
in this case the pottery industry.”

LOCAL 895 ALSO, charges that an-
other source of foreign competition
comes from England where, also, com- ,
peting pottery were is produced by
workers receiving considerably lowe_r
wages than required for Canadian liv-
ing standards. In the case of English
pottery, the union said, the competi-

tion was first heightened at the ex-

.pense of Canadian industry «by the de.

. valuation of the pound sterling. (An
