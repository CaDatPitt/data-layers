What are the ideas, the misconceptions, with which
‘_» the social-fascists confuse and disarm the workers?

Socialist Party Theories Q Mislead

First,]"is"ithe idea that fascism is the Opposite of
capitalist democracy, a_nd this democracy eisftherefore
, he means of combatting and defeating fascism.i This
false idea serves as-doub1e.purpose. By meansmoff A
fcounterposing “democracy against dictatorship,” “
‘ s‘ to hide the fact that the capitalist “democracy
is nry a form of the capitalist_dictatorship; it. tries
to.‘identify in the worker’s mind the fascist dictator- ‘
ship with the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet
.~"nion, and thus causethe worker to reject the road
of :re,voluton.' At the same time, this slogan is used‘ '
to -’hide,,,the‘,_fact that capitalist democracy” is not the 1-
enemy, but the mother of fascism; that it is Anotthe e. ”
“vdestroyer, but the _creator of fascism. It uses the ,
truth that fascism destroys ‘democracy, to propagate P 
thefalsehood that ‘democracy will also destroy fas- ~«'
cism. .Thus does the Socialist Party and trade union ,5
officialdom, to the extent that the Workers follow _ ‘\
them, tie the Working class to the chariot wheels of a" "
capitalist democracy which is being transformed into

‘ fascism, paralyze their resistance, deliver them over

 
  
   
  
    
   
  
  
   
   
   
 
 
 
  
  
  
    
 

 
   
 

gags ism bound and helpless. .

_ ‘ermany this meant support to Hindenburg,

"'ng,l Von Papen, Schleicher; and their “emerg-T

y ,;deci‘ees” directed against the workers.. In the

 tepdf-‘States, it is support to Roosevelt, LaGuardia, » ,
the N.R.A.,‘ "and the “emergency, degrees” of the #-
strikebreaking labor boards, arbitration boards, “code
"ut'hoi'ities,” etc. In each‘ case the slogan is “choose the

V /clawses. This idea helps finance capital to get‘ and

 fof, the revolution, the re-stabilization of capitalism,
 the beginning of a new and long era of fascist reac-

. , guard, the Qgmmunist Party. But at the same time

 

    
  
 
   
 
 
 
  
    
 
   
 
 
 
  
  

lesser evil”; in each, the workers are asked to “fight
against fascism” by supporting the men and measures
that are introducing fascism.

Second, is the idea that fascilsrn,,»r,,ﬂe_ resents, not .
finance sggapital, but rather a. “revolu” €ii1:ary‘imove- 
ment”v~c;elui1¥ected against. both‘ finance capital and

cep control .over these middle. classes, strengthens
"eir illusions, divides the Workers from them’ and
prevents the workers from setting themselves .the
- task of winning overthe middle classes. to.sup.port of
the proletarian revolution, causes the workers to sup-
port... their rnisleaders in their alliance ;“against fas- T
cism.” In Germany, this idea Was", concretely, alliance %
iwiths Hin/denburg against Hitler; in Austria, -with
Dollfuss against the Nazis; in the United States with
Roosevelt “against Wall Street.”

 Third,‘ with the victory‘- of’ fascism in Germany and
{Austria, the Socialist and trade union leaders bring
forth the idea that this event is the crushing defeat

tion. This ‘helps fascism by spreading panic, defeat-
ism, and passivity. among the workers. It serves to
create a fatalistic acceptance of fascism as vinesc»a,p.-, '
able and undefeatable.’ The true significance of; _
rise of fascism is quite different. True, fas.cism‘«t;u

solves not one of the basicproblems of thecrisis, but

intensifies them all;¢;jt further disrupts the capitalist

" ‘Throiugh fascism, the capitalist class hopes to d‘ V
roy the7threat of. revolution at home. Through‘ .

 .What are the prospects for success of this capital-

, Such prospects. are very bad indeed. The "'revolu-

I. EMANGIPATION or THE NEGROV

(From the report of Earl Browderpto the 8th Convention of
the Communist Party, April 2-8,A 1934.)
'I.'he struggle’ for Negro Rights

One of vthegichiefiiiitasks of€t_ehe Communist Part

enunciated; by” Karl,,Mar;< when he was organizing
international support by European Workers to the

cial oppression is inextricably bound up With the
cause of the emancipation of the ‘Working class. from
the oppresion of capitalism. Because our Party, as
basis tor our Negro program, it is necessary again i N
at this conjvention to continue to discuss it. '

,..From its inception, the Communist Party of the

in its program. In the first period of our war,

was because the Party, in spite of its correct general
orientation, did not have a clear Bolshevik under-

eration of an oppressed nati:on.; The.Party had not

yet entirely emancipated itself from the limitation of h

the bourgeois-liberal approach to Negro rights, nor
from the social-democratic denial of the, Negro ques-
tion with its formula that the Negro can find their
emanacipatinon only Withxthe‘ establishment, of Social-
i.sm,_and"as a part of the working class. The Party,
’howe,ver,, was ‘continually struggling. with this ques-i

aioni and constantly raising it again .for' discussion.

As a result of this, the problem Wa$‘_ brought to the

r .consideration of our World: Party /at the [_Sixth  ,
—”gress of the Communist International.‘ The resolu—";:,y,~;Aii'
’-tion there Worked out, subsequently“ elaborated "by? a” 
piilspeciial resolution in October, 1930,. finally armed our
T’ r Party‘ politically for a decisive step forward in rouse
 ing and organizing the liberation movement of the
 Negroes," in uniting Negro and white Workers in

firm and unbreakable solidarity.‘

Forms of, Negro Oppression

The characteristics of the position ofjthe Negroes‘

in America as an oppressed nation is. expressed in‘:

 1) the fact thatthe basic Negro population, engaged‘

in cultivating the land, is systematically excluded
from independent possession of the land which it

cultivates; 2) that it. is thereby‘ reduced to a position

of emi-serfdomiin the form of specially exploited
‘ ‘ T and sharecropers; 3) that this special exploit-

‘is enforced by a system of legal and illegal dis-T

  

personal, subjection to individual exploiters, and all
forms of violent oppression culminating in the most
brutal and barbarous system of murder, that it

has become notorious all over the world as lynch-law. _

slogan of Negro liberation is therefore the slogan.

  Meaning ‘of the ‘Scottsboro Case

 These basic political consideratipns have been, by
experience, proved to be absolutely necessary wea-
pons to make effectual even the smallest struggle for
Negro rights, Let us consider, for example, the world,
famous Scottsboro case, which has represented one
i of the major political achievements of the Communist
‘Party in the last period. -How impossible it would
I have been to rouse the Negro masses in the United
 . « States in millions to the support of the Scottsboro boys; V
f47‘7 how impossible to have joined with them millions of
 ’ twhite toilers and middle classes; how impossible to ‘
have stirred the entire world, as was done—i-f the
Scottsboro case had been taken up from the liberal-
humanitarian point of view, or if it had been ap-
proached from the narrow social-democratic view-
point! The Scottsboro case "stirred America to its
A depths, not merely because nine friendless Negro\b
were threatened with an unjust death, but bec ye,
their cause was brought forward clearly as a sym 017
of the national oppression of twelve million Negroes
in America, because the fight for their freedom was
made the symbol for the fight of the Negro farmer
for their land, of the fight for the self-determination,

in the Black Belt, of the fight against lynchings,
against Jim-Crowism, against the smallest discrimi-
nations for unconditional social and political equal-
ity for the Negroes.
Only the Bolshevik understanding of the Negro
uestioinrrlmakes possible such an effective fight for
the smallest advance for. the Negroes to realize their
_ smallest demands; that "is why historically-7it was left
or the Communist Party to be‘ the first to raise
- effectively, on a national scale, "the slogan of Negro
liberation, since the almost-forgotten days of the -
Abolitionists. ‘ L 9 ' . -
§, The Communists unconditionally, reject the social- ~
;-delmocratic approach of the Second International to
x the Negro question and to the national question gen-
jerally, which under‘ the guise of a-strictly ‘‘working

’ Divisions Among Negro People

3 i ,j,The Communist Party points out‘that the Negroes

algo are dividedinto classes; that in addition to the
,of.Negroi farmers, there is a considerable and
 ‘proletariat, a Negro middle class and. a
Aggro bourgeoisie. The Negro bourgeoisie, also sub-
'jécted’l to the special oppression of the Negro people
as a whole, has been corrupted into accepting this
