 ONE Republican campaign_ promise‘ had been
broken by the. new Congress before press time for this
issue of THE’ UNION- That was the pledge to do some‘-

. J thing about anti-poll tax and anti-lynching legislation.

Although some good bills on these subjects were intro?

duced by Republican congressmen, the Senate, under
leadership of Senator.Taft, killed a moveto liberalize the‘
., rules so as to stop. filibusters. This means that Southern
Senators can continue easily to line up the one-third of the '

votes needed to block any bills they don’t like.

Leaders of the big labor federations, meanwhile, were
trying to soothe their members byyquoting from President-

R elect Eisenhower’s campaign speeches. The job of mobiliz-

ing membership against attacks on living\ standards and
"the very right to collective bargaining will, apparently, be
a neglected until the new Big Business administration has.
' hadtime to start its work. ’

. ' Both Meany and Reuther, presidents of AFL and C10,.-
. made year~end statements indicating a hope that support
C, of the..Truman-Eisenhower foreign policy would be re- '
. »warded~by freedom from further attacks on their unions. ‘

This is a continuation of the suicidal policy ‘followed

by these federations during-the Truman period. N owthat

Big Business is more openly in control than ever before

Mine-Mill Research Department

Copper companies look, to the new

Eisenhower Administration for either
aprice increase or an end to controls,
according to the Wall Street Journal
of December 29.

The forecast of higher prices came
-shortly" after Michael V. DiSalle, Eco-
'nomic Stabilizer, turned down a request
‘for suspension of ceilings or for an

increase in the domestic price of 24%
‘cents a pound.

DiSal e in explamin his action

’ stated tliait he believed ctgppéf wdg 
in short supply. He also said that
“. . . in view of the favorable current

¢tll"7llil_t] position of the industry, no 'in- ,

.4’ . . . . - - - n
‘crease in ceilings zs jttsttfted.

U.S. produced copper sold during
all of last year at the ceiling price of
24% cents a pound. Last summer’ the
Office of Price Stabilization lifted
ceilings bn imported copper. Since
then imported copper has been selling
" . I §o’.‘about 11 cents a pound above the
14/‘ domestic price. The European market,

= near the end of last year, settled down

to a basis of about 33% cents a pound.

High -production of war goods in the

coming year is expected to help sustain

. _ copper demand at relatively high
 prices. At the same time trade ob-
s rvers note signs of possible softening

up

I) demand.

The Defense Production Administra-

tion last year removed copp_er from the
list of “most critical” materials. The
Administrator, at the time,'stated that

— supplies should be sufficient in the
first ‘quarter of 1953 to authorize con-
sumption of all copper ’required for
civilian uses in addition to military
Tequirenients. -
It is also noted that European de-
mand for all metals has slackened
greatly since early 1952. The economic
§lifficult_i_es of these countries as the
result of war preparations and the
shutting‘ off of normal trade with
Eastern Europe has- severely cut down

: on use of metals.

  Lead

Lead prices by the end of 1952 re-
"gained some of the ground lost in its
drop from 19 cents at the beginning of
the year. Lead, ‘at the year’s end, was
back to 14.75 cents.

In explaining the drop in lead and

zinc prices, the Albuquerque Journal _

H of January 4 notes:
.“The‘price decline dates back to the
’8care-buying of metals‘ in the free
world in 1951. The supply of zinc and

''''demand.’’

Zinc p1'i.'é€'s ‘(iii .lan'uary.2 advanced
17$ cent a pound to 13‘ cents. This was
the first change in the price of zinc
since October 23, when it-was cut one

cent from 131/2 cents.
Stocks held by industrial users are

, now reported to be at a very low level.

Lack of sufficient water‘ pdwer in the

the Coeur d’Alenes.

INCO wants increase

International Nickel, which is now
making profits at the rate of $119 mil-
Ilion a year before taxes, and $61 mil-
lion after taxes, is out to get more.
The company, whichproduces over
So percent of the world’s supply of
nickel, recently asked for-approval of
a price increase, of 31/2 cents a pound
from C. D. Howe, Canada’s Minister of
the Interior. This would bring the price
‘to 60 cents a pound in the'U. S.
A high official of the conipany re-
cently visited Washington to ask the
U. S. Office of Price Stabilization not

to oppose the increase when the mat-
ter comes before the Canadian govern-
ment. According to the .Northern
Miner of January 1, the increase now
appears as a “strong likelihood” as the
result of these talks. .
Canadian producers now supply the
bulk ‘of the_100,000 tons of nickel a
year «imported by the United States.
U. S. price officials‘ made clear that,
if the increase were granted; concerns

usingnickel would be ‘able to pass on ‘

_a portion ofthe increase to consumers.

“Compensation laws

Thirty-one of 54 State, Federal and
Territorial compensation -laws - now
cover all occupational diseases. Vir-
ginia last -year shifted from schedule

coverage (under which only listed dis-
eases are covered) to full coverage of
all occupational diseases.

This was one of the few advances ‘

made in workmen’s compensation,’ ac-
cording «to a recent survey of state

San Manuel is a subsidiary of Mag-

ildaho’ election
JanucIry19-22

By Graham Dolan
WALLACE, Idaho——-Some 3,500

workers in the Coeur d’Alene:es

mining district will participate
January 19, 20, 21 and 22 in one
of the largest and most compli-
cated representation elections
affecting Mine-Mill in recent
years. i

National Labor Relations Board
elections will be held on those four
,days at 29 properties, with a varietY
of ballots and choices that Will SeVe1'e-
ly tax the resources of the regional
NLRB apparatus.

One election will involve merely the
question of a “yes” or “no” vote for
_Mine-Mill. This will be participated in
by employees of 23 properties. The
election is an over-all one and a ma-
izrity of “yes” votes will certify Mine-
' ill as the bargaining representative
of the workers on a consolidated basis.

VICTORY for Mine-Mill in this elec-
-tion will mean that all 23 properties,
owned by many employers, Will deal
with the union as one employer with a
single contract. The mines and other
properties involved in this election are
Is follows:

Galena, Jack Waite, Hercules-Shep
man, Tamarack, Day Rock, National-
Goldhunter, Day Mines Warehouse,
Coeur d’Alene, Dredge Fund, Page,
Frisco, Golconda, Highland Surprise,
Hill Lease, John George Lease, Mas-
cot, Nabob, Spokane-Idaho (Douglas),
Spokane-Idaho (Constitution), Sunset
Minerals, ‘ind Zanetti Brothers.

The National CIO is conducting 9.
'raid at five other properties and on the
ballots for these elections Mine-Mill
will be opposed by the CIO and “nei-
ther” union. The properties involved
are the Bunker Hill Mine, Bunker Hill
Smelter, and Sullivan Zinc plant, all

I voting as a single unit; the Sunshine

roperlies, the Morning Mine, and the
Lucky lfriday Mine. The latter two are
involverl in separate elections.

IT WAS PREDICTED that the gang
ofisec-;-.;sionists at Mine—Mill’s Local 9
would not be on the ballot in the- Morn-
ing antl- Lucky Friday, elections be-
cause of failure to. comply with the

, non-Co nnunist affidavit provisions of

the Taft-Hartley Act. Local 9 disrup-
tionist: were Qxpected to oppose the
camps- “n of Mine—Mi11 Local 18 to rep-
resent the men at the two Mullan mines.

In z'..'..Iltioni to the above elections,
there will be four craft "Votes at the

, Bunker-§’lill-Sullivan properties. These

will ianolve Mine-Mill, CIO and the
AFL \“L'-'.1rpenters, Machinists, Brick-

layers. and Painters. The AFL Car-

pentess and Bricklayers still were not

‘in co .:;)liance with Taft-Hartley at
~. press time. Elections will be held re- p

gardlez‘ ‘.

Non: of the ballots in any of‘ the
nine s - "arate elections will be counted
until the four days of voting are com-
pleted, The dates for the elections are

I How do nationalist movements affect us? l

DENVER, Colo.——According\ to the
“Mining Record,” Blair Burwell, presi-
dent of the Colorado \Mining Ass’n,
made “the top speech of the year” here
a few weeks ago. _

It wasn't the top speech because he
said.“the war in Korea is for posses-
sion of metal deposits.”

It wasn’t because he stated that
“Korea possesses one of the largest
tungsten deposits in the world. . .”

Nor was it his admission that “the
real war is over metals.” Such things
have been said before in quiet confer-
ences where businessmen get together

. and say things to each other which sel-

dom make the headlines read by ‘the
general public.
. No, we have to dig a little deeper
into the “M1ning Record’s” story of
Burwell’s speech to see why it was the
“WP Speech” of the year. And that
story goes on to say:

“Korea has supplied metals and raw
materials for the U. S., but these sup-
plies appear to be near the end.

“People in Korea want their own
technology and want to be able to use
their own raw‘ materials. As things
stand now, the ores are mined cheaply
in Korea and sent to this country to
be made into finished products which
the Asiatics in turn have to buy at
enormous prices, hence the nationalism
of industry in those countries—it has
to be done to protect their own in-
terests.”

so, WE SEE, the issue in Korea

is.n’t “Communism.”

The issue, as the Mining R-ecord re-
ports, it a simple one: “the people in

By Herman Schenclel

Korea . . . want to be able to _use their -

own raw materials.”

The issue is the same one a group of
colonies once proclaimed to the world
-—on July 4, 1776. H

The issue is “Independence.”

The people of Korea want to own
the fruits of their own labor. It’s just
like that. And, in this respect, they
are like many other people, in many
other places in this world. Mr. Burwell
admitted that; and on Sunday, Dec. 21,
the financial pages of the Denver Post
confirmed it once again, with this
headline:

“U. N. VOTE ALARMS PRIVATE
INVESTORS”

the story itself saying: A
_ “On Dec. 11 the U. N. general as-
sembly’s economic and financial conf-
mittee voted 31 to 1 in favor of a pro-
posal introduced by Bolivia andlran
intended to promote nationalism of
resource industries in less developed
countries.”

But even these admissions do not
make Burwell’s story “tops” for the
year. Almost any big financial paper
these days confesses that a regular
rash of “independence” is breaking out
in those countries which the Big Busi-
ness boys like to call the “underde-
veloped areas” of the world.

WE DON’T KNOW the exact point
of Burwell’s speech that gained it top
honors. The Mining Record doesn't
say. But we’ll bet it was this para-
graph, down near the end of the story,
that caught the rapt attention of the
listeners:

“Mr.' Burwell predicted that lead and
zinc mines in this country will be at a
premium before long, because nation-

alism in foreign mining is sure to ar-
rive in those countries that are now

being exploited. Chile and Bolivia are

the latest examples.”

Mr. Burwell didn’t'make that speech
for the workers of this land, but every
worker could mark it well—and. file it

away in a nice, handy spot.

For what Burwell was admitting—-
but didn’t say—was that this rash of
“Independence” is good, not bad, for
America’s workers. What he was ad-
mitting was that in the long run, it is
going to- spell more jobs and ‘higher
wages and greater security for the
workers of this land.

IT NEVER WAS good for the work-
ers of this land to have a’ few giant
banks and trusts, located on or .-bout
Wall Street, control the resources of
countless countries on this‘globe. The
same big bosses who boast about the
“high American standard of living”
are only too happy to close down a
property in, let us say, Colorado, and
operate one in Bolivia—if the “depen-
dence” of Bolivian workers insures a.
super profit.

Let the “U.N. Vote Alarm Private
Investors!” Let the John Foster Dull-
eses and the Hoovers and the Morgans
quake at the sound of “Independence."
So they quaked in England in 1776 and
predicted a dire future for the world.

But Independence broke the bottle-
neck that was strangling the productive
power of a continent. If the peoples
of the world can. own the fruits: of
their own national labor and‘ buy with
those fruits, it is. going. to spell more-
jobs and prosperity—and independence

——fo'r America’s workers.

Louiseville sfrikebreaking

Protests from all partsof Canada are
.going.- to, Premier Duplessis of Quebec

condemning police brutality against ~

peaceful picketeers of the Catholic Syn-
dicate Union at Louiseville‘, Que.

This strike, now in its 11th'month,

I :_ is‘ being waged against a Wall Street

corporation, United Merchants and
Manufacturers, which made $16 million

in profit last year.’ This company has“

used", strikebreakers and goons,‘ with
theewholehearted support of the‘ Du-
plessis government and the help of the
provincial police.
Msgr. Donat Baril, parish priestof
Louiseville, criticized what he "called
4 “delaying tactics” of " the Associated
Textiles, and called for “immediate dis-
missal of newly hired workers (scabs)
to correct a “social injustice.”
Dealing with the multi-million dollar
’ American firm which was paying rates
of from 70 to 75 cents an hour when
the strike started, Msgr. Baril stated
‘f~It. looks very much as if they want the
union to die.” - — ‘

- .PREMIER DUPLESSIS, in the face

‘ of the fact that members of a Catholic

Union are involved, has sought to
cor." up police brutality by seeing the
just strike of the workers as 31 “Bol-
shevik plot.” This motheaten tactic is
viewed‘ by labor observers in Quebec .s
a ‘cover-up to the fact that the life of
all unions in Quebec, including Catholic

D affiliates, stand in serious jeopardy.
The Rev. Glenn Partridge, President“

of the Montreal» Civil Liberties Union,

: has charged that “peaceful picketers
_ ‘Were attacked with tear gas and ‘clubs .
and after this the Riot Act was read.”

_Calling on the Government to settle
the strike amicably, Partridge stated
-that “all Canadians are horrified by
the action r-' the police in Louiseville.”

WASHINGTON, D. C.-'-—The tables were turned on Sen. ‘Pati McCa_rran,;.'
America’s.arch witch h_unter,. December 30. ‘ " = 
For.a few hours,‘ 9 the hunter wasthe. hunted. ' A‘ 1‘ a .
' The labor-hating Nevada. senator. was a _wi_tnes’si.in pre—trial';qu"estioniI'Ig, 
in a million-dollar damage suit'__against him and some 40 other Nevadans. The *
suit is based on charges that McCarran and the major gambling andgresort. ,, _
owners in Las Vegas conspired to run the Las Vegas Sun out of businessibe-L5 
t cause the paper opposed McCarran politically. . 
His squirming answers exposed him as a petty chiseler, a. cheap. t_ax-Ff:
fixer, a pal and defender of gangster~gamblers. ‘ - . "
‘He admitted that his 1944 and.1950_ campaign headquarters werein the 
El Centro hotel, Las Vegas, and tothis “recollection”. were notpaid for. “As 

a rule,” said McCarran, “when I would

i go into» any one of these hotels, into’ the '

dining room . . . when I would ask for
the check, any one of these hotels
would say, ‘Tlierevis no check’.”

Questions also dragged from- him:
an admission that he once interceded
in a tax case on behalf of a luxury ho-
tel which the Kefauver Senate Crime
committee described as “one . of. the
country’s most elaborate gambling es-
tablishments.” The 1950 tax case in-
volved the Flamingo Hotel.

ASKED if he had taken up the case

with.Charles« Oliphant, Bureau of In- -.

ternal Revenue general counsel" who re-
signed 'under fire last ,year, McCarran
. said, “I think that’s _right'.”"Th'e Ke-

fauver committee said the Flamingo .
Hotel was under control of the late

gangster, Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel.
The. Nevada super-patriot also ad-
mitted that he “got rid of” Denver
Dickerson, who was editor of the Ne-
__ vada State Labor News (AFL), be-
cause the paper had sometimes criti-
cized him. He did this by having Dick-
erson hired by the State Department
and sent to ‘Rarngoon, Burma. “I think
the experience willdo him good,” said
McCarran. ' .
' McCarran also declared he‘ never.
“threatened” gambling’ because “the
gambling business has become part of
the financial structure of the “state.”
McCarran as a witness on the
stand, defending himself in a million-
dollar damage suit, was far different
from the “Sagebrush Caesar” who pre-
sided over the Senate Internal Security
Committee hearings. on Mine-Mill. .
When Mine-Mill witnesses told Mc-
Carran, “I can’t remember,” he harsh-

of the Pacific. The jobs of some 5,000
AFL Seafarers and AFL _Sailors*Uni_on
foreign-bom members of these unions
are threatened by the act. _ . - ‘

_ The President’s Commission called
for junking the “national origins quota
system” which has operated since 1924

_and which was :made -even more strin-.

gent under the ‘McCarran-Walter Act.

_,-_In itsplace was proposed a unified
quota system -without regard to na-

800 attend funeral
of Collis English

TRENTON, N. J. (FP)—Eight hun-
dred mourners gathered here Jan. 3 for .
the funeral of Collis English, one of the
Trenton Six, who died of a ‘heart at-
tack Dec. 30 in New Jersey state pri-
son.

‘The crowd filled every bit of space

fl"wcd into the street. Later, a 60-car
procession followed, the flower-covered
coffin to'Greenwood cemetery, where
a militaryvhonor guard from Fort Dix
buried the 27-year-old veteran of World
War‘ II. r

English died in the prison hospital as
he was awaiting a new trial ordered by
the New Jersey. supreme court Nov. 24,

-whe_n it threw out a verdict that had
~ Acon-"..-mned him and Ralph Cooper to
 life imprisonment. The two were con-
victnd a year anda half earlier at a
trial which saw four co-defendants
acquitted of murdering storekeeper
William Horner in 1948. That trial was
4 held after a worldwide campaign to
save the Trenton Six had won 3; court
reversal of an earlier verdict condemn-
ingv all six to death.

Jam-as Thorpe and John McKenzie,
two of the freed men, led the pall-
bearers. Escorting members of Eng-

and healthland social‘ security prob-
lems. It. gives special attention to
problems-of Negro women,-nearly half
of whom are in the labor force, in con-
trast to less than one-third of white
women. ‘

Miss Hutchins points out that “the
labor movement is still run by men,”
although women form a sizable pro-
portion of union membership. She esti-
mates that about three million women
belong to U. S. unions’. ' I

.“About one in ‘five’ (21%) of the 14
million organized workers in the U. S.,
then, are women,” she says. “But less

than one in six (16%) of the 18,300,000.

women at work in the spring of 1952
were organized in trade unions.”

The three million forganized women
workers are entitled to adequate,repre-
sentation in their unions, she notes,
but adds; “Yet everyone who‘ has at-
tended any recent convention of the
national labor bodies knows that very
few women are visible as delegates on
the floor.” -' ’ g

At the 1951 CIO convention, she
points out, only -six of the 539 dele-
gates were women. Of the 599 dele-
gates] at ‘the 1951 AFL convention,
12 were women. A few unions are"ap-
parently, aware of the problems of
working mothers, she says, citing state-
ments by the United Auto Workers
(CIO) and actions by the United Pack-
inghouse Workers’ (_CIO) and United
Electrical Radio & Machine Workers.

IN A SEPARATE chapter, Miss
Hutchins takes on the myth that wo-
men are not militant, reporting histor-
ical episodes and more recent inci-
dents. “For 130 years in innumerable
strikes for higher pay and better con-
ditions, women workers have shown
their courage and spirit on the picket-
lines at plant gates,”V she says.‘ “They
have defied police clubs and teargas,
militiamen’s guns, lstrikebreakers’ fists
and attacks by company thugs. They
have been arrested and jailed, but they‘
have come back again on the picket-

-line to continue the struggle.”

WASHINGTON: 13- QC’-La situacion‘~
fué ‘cambiada para el Senador Pat Me.
Carran, el primer cazador del brujas

A 'de América,"e1 dia 30 de diciembre.

For unaspocas horas este ‘cazador
fué ‘e1 cazado. Y le hizo incomodo,
evas1vo y, 9. veces, colérico.

McCarran /como testigo en la tribuna,
defendiendose contra un pleito. de
daﬁos devun millon de dolares, fué
muy distinto del “rey del mesq1_1ite”
que presidié las juntas McCarran con-
tra Mine-Mill. ‘

Cuando los testigos de Mine-Mill Ie
decién a McCarran, “No me acuerdo,”

el ésperamente prdenaba, “Conteste si '

o no.” Lo hizo claro que en su opinion
cualquiera que no podia acordarse,
meiitié. _

Pero cuando zi McCarran en la tri-

buna le hiceiron preguntas sobre in-p

cidentes que tuvieron lugar hace

muchos aﬁos; contesto repetidas. v‘eces'
,“que no se acordaba” o"‘creo que eso

es correcto.”

En Salt Lake. McCarran ordené a
testigos de Mine-Mill repetidamente
que “Conteste la pregunta,” e ignord

_la protesta de un testigo que “Ud no

me deja contestar a mi mode.”
Pero en este juicio, McCarran le

gr_it6 al licenciado William A. Roberts,

quien le estaba haciendo las preguntas,
“N o quiero que me pongas palabras en.
mi boca.” Roberts, quien parece ha leido
reportes de algunas de las juntas~ de
McCarran, contesté, “Definitivamente
‘no haré eso, Senador. Estoy muy con-.
sciente de la rnanera en que eso so
esté. haciendo en otro. lugares.”

points out, there has been only
one cabinet appointment (that of

Andrew Mellon-by Harding) that -

compares in - “political audacity’:
with the naming of such men as
Charles E. Wilson, of General
Motors, and George M. Humphrey,
of M. A. "Hanna Co., to cabinet
rank. Fortune is the $1.25 per

. copy magazine of big business.

Other bankers and industrial-,
ists ‘previously have held im-
portant government jobs, particu-
larly under Truman’s cold war
mobilization program. Now, how-
ever, as Fortune points out, the
“Big Corporations: are coming
Gt. 1. . {:1  r0Om.)r.\  are
taking over 'C6*I‘ilxt?.1~.e.te'.¢.“*‘E‘->01 in
the new administration. '

J. P. Morgan and Co. and the
Rockefeller banks, wl1ich.togethe1'
control the major monopoly cor-
porations in the U.S., are well
represented on the new business-
men's team. So are the National
Association of Manufacturers.

General Motors, the world’s

"largest manufacturing corpora-

tion, grabs off the most jobs in
the new set-up. G.M. has been

- getting the largest share of war

goods contracts. Now, G.M.’s
president, as the new Secretary
of Defense, will,be dishing it out
__from the other end. His chief
deputy on this job will be Roger
Kyes, a G.M. vice-president.
Other G.M. men in the cabinet

include the new Secretary of ‘

Interior, Douglas McKay, and
Postmaster General Arthur Sum-
merfield. Both of these men are
very large G.M. car dealers.‘

The mining industry, will also
have its friends in the new cabi-
net: "

John Foster Dulles, Secretary

, of State‘, is a former director of

International Nickel.

George M. Humphrey, Secre-
tary of Treasury, has been long
active in iron ore, steel and coal
companies. He organized the

company which is now exploiting
rich iron ore reserves in Labra-
dor. »- He is also a director I of
Phelps Dodge.

Sinclair Weeks, Secretary. of
Commerce, among many jobs, has
been a_ director of the First Na-
tional Ba.nk of Boston which has
substantial holdings in Calumet
& Hecla, a Michigan Copper 00m‘
pany, and in U.S. Smelting, Re-
fining & Mining.

The one non-business appointee
in the new cabinet is Martin Dur-
kin, president of the AFL
Plumbers Union, who will hold
the job of Secretary ‘of Labor.
Barron’s, a prominent financial
publication, assures its readers
that the Labor Department has
been "stripped of so many of its

powers by Taft’s leadership in

Congress that the/' Secretary of
Labor has less power than any
other cabinet officer.

The manner of Durkin’s ap-
pointment betrayed a contempt-
uous attitude toward the position
and toward organized labor. There
was no .consultation with anyone
from any union. The first Durkin
knew of his appointment was
when he read it in a newspaper.
Just one day earlier, President
George Meany of the AFL had

talked with Eisenhower but there .
' had been no mention of the Dur-

kin appointment. Durkin has not
been involved in any of the meet-
ings . of Eisenhower's appointees
and advisers.
