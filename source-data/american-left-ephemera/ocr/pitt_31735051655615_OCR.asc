VISIT

United States U.1V. A mbassador Jea ne Kirkpatrick will address the University of Pittsburgh
commencement exercise for the graduating class of '81, 2 p. m. Sunday 26’ April. Her recent contrrn‘ersial
meeting with high-ranking South Africa military leaders and her statements regarding the December
deaths of three US. nuns and one lay worker in El Salvador raise questions about her rega rd for inter-
national human rights.

In response to her meeting with South African representatives, the Congressional Black Caucus has
called forAmbassador Kirkpatrick Is resignation. Rep. William Gray /D-Pa. I speaking for the Black
Caucus stated:  . . 7?) choose apartheid is to alienate all of black Africa. It is also a slap in the face of
26 million black A merica ns.”

In line with Secretary of State Alexander M. I-laig Jr. is suggestion that the nuns and lay worker were
killed in El Salvador because they tried to run a roadblock, A mbassador Kirkpatrick commented:

“The nuns were not just nuns . . . (they) were also political activists,"

The disinformation regarding the rape and murder of the three nuns and one lay worker serre only
to dupe the A merican public and confuse the issue of El Salradoris problems and US. intervention.

In the March 28 issue of 2 he ﬂation, SisterAlicia Ra mir )2, a Loretto nun who works in
Central America stated: “Americans need to know that U.S. money is being used. . . to kill and oppress
people I in El Salvador). People need to know that their tax money is going to kill U.S. nuns."

The call for a public protest aginst Ambassador K irkpatrickfs appearance at the Civic Arena is
a call for just democratic reforms and human rights.
