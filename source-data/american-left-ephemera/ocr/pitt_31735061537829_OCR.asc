At our District Convention held in June, 1938, a
District Training School was proposed for the pur-
pose of training new leadership during the month of
Ootober. This resolution has_been carried our with
a large amount of success. Despite some serious
shortcomings, our first District Training school
was very successful and the fifteen graduates can
now go forward as leaders in the District, and
staunch I. W. O. builders. »

The purpose of the school was not merely to educate
our students and improve their intellectual capaci-
ties. Our purposei was to train, to develop and to
create people who will not only become a force in
building the Order, but also to lead the Order into
becoming an integral part of the progressive move-
ment of today.

The school cost about M$l32.OO, or about $8.00 per
student. This we feel was no sacrifice. Every
hour spent in training is an investment. It is

bound to improve the years
and bring better leadership.

of practical experience

Next year, we plan a bigger and better school. If
we learn from our mistakes and improve on our ac-
complishments, a fine school is assured.

We are now entering the membership drive of 1959.
The "District" will have at its disposal these well
equipped leaders and forces who will direct the ac-
tivities of the Order and will enable us to go over
the top in the forthcoming campaign.

work, also to train Presidents and

with the exception of Wednesday.
Weekday classes were held from 8:30

tached to running a school.

The School held a large graduation
party Saturday night, November 5th.
All the students contributed to the
party in one way or another. Some
donated cakes and candy,others per-
formed and entertained; one student
brought an electric somovar and we
had tea. As "Master of Ceremonies"
we had Dr. Finkelstein, Chairman of
the District. We were addressed by
several of the students, our Dis-
trict Secretary Ben Gordon,and the
National Educational Director of
the Order, Emanuel Levin, who pre-
sented the students with diplomas.

CONCLUSION

On our last school day,all the stuu
dents gave their comments and criti~
cisms on the School and each was
given an assignment in the District.

It was a hard grind, this intensive
course, but our students were sorry
to leave, not only because of the
courses of study, but also because
of the many friendships they had
made during the school term.

Respectfully submitted,

School Secretary

LETTERS FROM STUDENTS

The brief study course which I fol-
lowed under the instruction of our
National Educational Director, Bro-
ther Levin,though it cannot be con-
sidered complete and exhaustive in
view of its wide field. Neverthe~
less,it has given me a sound found~
ation for further study.

The clear and human approach to the
subjects were sufficient to keep up
my enthusiasm and interest right
through the entire course. One can
only feel sorry that it ended so
900110

There is no doubt in my mind that
if every member of our Order would
take time off for such a course, it
would not only add to his own moral
and spiritual strength, but would
help build the Qrder into becoming
a model for working—c1ass organiza-
tions.

My appreciation and sincere thanks
goes to all of the teachers that
helped to make this course so sucw
cessful and pleasant.

Fraternally,
Anna Brody

.etters from students (con.)

As you know I only attended the
school for about four days and in
such a short time I could not pos-
sibly give a clear and just picture
of the Training School. However, I
do feel that since I was a student

even for only four sessions,I ought
to make a contribution of some kind
G0 the bulletin. My .contribution
shall take the form of a task in
the I.W.O. in general and a student
in particular. One of the things
Jhlch I think is very necessary and
vital to the growth of the Order is
sadly lacking in our Order. This is
3 cheery, congenial stmosphere at
aur meetings. It is up to the mem-
aers and students to see to it that
this condition is quickly corrected.

Brother Levin pointed out to us
that our fraternal does not radiate
the brotherly feeling that it
should, especially toward the new
members. This is a major cause of a
great deal of the fluctuation in
our membership. I need not repeat
what Brother Levin said on this
problem and its solution, for it
would be like carrying "coals to
Newcastle". I will merely emphasize
this shortcoming in its relation to
the colored people.

The Negro is traditionally a care-
free, happy~go—lucky, congenial and
jolly person and we cannot hope to
recruit him into the Order.or keep
him there if this condition pre-
vails.Since the recruitment of 5000
colored brothers and sisters in the
Order is one of our major tasks, we
can see how necessary it is to im-
prove our fraternal life.

Fraternally yours,
Riedel Simmons

AN ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL

Although 37 students registered,
only 16 received diplomas. Of the
eleven that did not graduate, four
attended only a few sessions, the
rest did not attend any.

Or the course of study originally
outlined most of them were carried
out.Due to circumstances beyond our
control we did not spend the time
we should have on the Trade Union
Movement,Progressive Political Move-
ments and National and Local Health
Problems.

Every major language section was
represented with the exception of
the Jewish Section. There were stu-
dents from the English, Italian,
Ukranian, Polish and Creation
Sections. The English Section had
eleven students, four of whom were
Negroes.

Nine of the graduates were below
thirty, the rest being between the
ages of thirty and fifty.

We were very fortunate in having

as our main instructor,the National
Educational Director,Emanuel Levin,
who certainly is a sterling example
not only of a fine understanding
and well-informed instructor, but
also an inspiring example of our
national leadership.

were 9

Of the 16 graduates, there

men and 7 women.

There were 9 lodges represented,and
lodge 581 had the largest amount of
students - 7.

Seven students have been in the
Order a year or less,four have been
members for two years, 3 have been
members for three years, one has
been a member for four years, and
one, Feduk, for five years.

The week—end classes were well atw
tended, but the Thursday and Friday
classes were poorly attended. The
basic I.W.0. classes were held on
the week—ends,so our students reap~
ed the greatest. benefit from these
classes.

LESSONS OF THE SCHOOL

Sunday, the day after graduation,
was spent in going over the lessons
of the school. All the students and
the District Secretary, Brother Ben
Gordon, gave their criticisms and
comments on the school and the fol-
lowing points were stressed:

1. Better Organization

Several weeks before the opening of
the school term,the students should
be assembled and the school com-
mittee should be elected then.

The school committee should work
cut the finanoes,school curriculum,
and be the driving force in prepar-
ing and carrying out a successful
Qchcolo

3. More penetration in the lodges

One of our weaknesses lay in not
penetrating far enough in our
lodges. Most of the students came
from a few lodges, the big majority
of lodges were untouched.The school
committee is to wage an intensive
campaign in every lodge in the Dis-
trict to find the suitable people
for the school. -

3.

The District should aim to raise as
much finances for the school as pos-
sible. Money for the school should
be set aside at every District Gon-
vention, the school being a yearly
activity.

Finances

Affairs should be run by the lodges
to raise the tuition fees for the
students.When the lodges get pepped
up about the school, then we can be
issured of a successful school.

guage Sections

also very poorly represented,having,

The school is a fine place Whclg
all the various nationalixles can
meet, speak a language, namely Eng-
lish and exchange their views.

The school will help to dispel many
of the prejudices that nationali-
ties hold against one another, and
the frank and open discussion we
had during the school term helped
to bring more closely together the
various nationalities. Such educa-
tion must be carried on in the
language sections.

Student Silverman (male) sang ‘a

To hear him sing, one would think

Wharf from Poland a few hours
before.

Ada Vann was never late or absent
from any of the sessions, an en-
viable record.
