' Rising Prices Too

With production ‘booming in
all branches of the non-ferrous
metals industry, prices are show-
ing a similar upward thrust.
_Prices of all important non-fer-
rous metals except copper have
shown substantial advances over

years ago. They employ-many thousand fewer workers

the past year. Copper produciers, » -

in this country have held steady

at the U.S. price of 31 cents per 9

raised prices in Europe for cop'-

Curtis Addresses
Economcs Glass

P R 0 V O, Utah—District 3
Board Member Verne Curtis
spoke to a graduate school eco-
nomics class at Brigham Young
University on March 4 on “The
Relationship of Mine-Mill to the
United States Government and
the AFL-CIO.” .

In a two—hour presentation to
.a labor seminar, half of which
was devoted to questions and
answers, he outlined the demo-
cratic procedures, heritage, and
traditions of the union-asking
the students to compare Mine-

Mill’s constitutional r e q u i r e- f

ments with those of any other
international union in the coun-
try. .

Curtis, in explaining some of
the union’s difficulties through
the years, noted that the mining
industry is a tough business,
and therefore a tough union is
required.

T He pointed out that Mine-Mill
was among the first to have a
non-discrimination clause in its
constitution (since 1912), and
that it was the first to eliminate
wage differentials between the
North and the Southwest (in the
;Kennecott Council). '
./ Mine-Millcontributions to the
maintenance of judicial guaran-
tees’ were explained by Curtis,
noting the Jencks case as an
example.

He discussed the union’s work
in pushing for effective mine
safety laws and its position on
the problems of automation.

J . Kenneth Davies, an associ-
ate professor of economics at the
university, asked Curtis to ad-
dress the seminar.

Local 937 to Elect
Bargaining Group

SAN MANUEL, Ariz.——Mine-
Mill Local 937, with nine differ-
ent divisions of San Manuel
Copper Company employees un-
der its jurisdiction, this month
will elect 28 regular and alter-
‘nate members of the 1964 bar-
gaining committee. b

Each division will hold its
own election. President Fred
Sanchez and Business Agent
Rodolfo Garcia will also be on
the committee.

According to Garcia, “Those
who have, already been nomi-
nated are sincere and respon-
sible men who can lead Local
937 to a successful bargaining
conclusion.”

Local union leaders here have
been working closely with Lo-
cal 938 in Superior on contract
preparations.

Memorial Fund to
Send Girl to Camp

HARWINTON, Conn. — The
neighborhood Girl Scout organi-
zation here has established the
Debbie Han Memorial Camper-
ship Fund, which will be used
each year to send a deserving
local Girl Scout to camp.

The fund was set up in mem-
ory of Debbie Han, a seven-
year-old Consolidated S c h 0 ol
pupil, who (lied shortly after
Christmas last year. She was
a Brownie in Harwinton Troop
93, which her mother led for
several years. . =

Debbie was the daughter of

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Organizing Drives

Set in Four States

Mine-Mill has filed petitions with the National Labor
Relations Board asking for elections at three properties
where organizing ‘campaigns have been carried on in
recent months. A fourth petition, for an election at the

‘smelter in Anaconda, Mont., will be filed in the Very near

future. ,
Biggest properties involved are two at which Mine-

‘Mill once had bargaining rights—Bunker Hill in the

Coeur d’Alene district of Idaho, where some 1500 miners
and smeltermen are employed, and the Anaconda smelter,
where employment in the past I

An April 4 meeting in Bisbee
of the A r i z o n a Mine-‘Mill
Council will kick off a state-
wide political action program
for 1964. Irving Dichter, in-
ternational secreta_ry-treas-
urer, will attend, and there
will be several speakers from
other labor organizations. Po-
litical . activity this year is
expected to in c l u d e voter
registration drives, candidate
endorsement, door-to-door
campaigning, and get-out-the
vote drive. The meeting will
be held at the Copper Queen

few years has dropped radically,
from ‘about 2200 to approxi-
mately 1000.

' The other organizing drives
are at Humbolt, Ariz., where the

Shattuck-Deen Mining Company - 

employs some 250 underground
miners, and at Heber City, Utah,
Where about 130 miners work
for the Hecla Mining Company.

No word has been received

- from the NLRB on the Bunker

Hill petition, although it was
filed in October. The Northwest
Metal Workers, an independent
union which three years ago
broke_ .a 71/2-month Mine-Mill

strike there, now has bargaining ,

rights at the property.
United Steelworkers Local

75089, during a recent strike
.against the Sunshine Mining

Company, maintained that
Northwest is to blame for the

‘ inferior contract pattern in the
district. Three years ago, how-

ever, Steel had been the only
labor organization in the country
to support Northwest.

J. L. Cochran, Joe Dunne, and
Thomas McGuire are staff mem-
bers in charge of the organizing
campaign, directed by Board

Member Barney Rask.
« ‘At Anaconda, International
‘Representative George W. Kala-

fatich and Rask are heading the
drive. More than enough cards

have ‘been signd to petition for
.-the election.

There ‘has been a rapid break- V

downin union organization dur-
ing the brief two years that the
Steelworkers have had the con-
tract’ at the property. Complaints
among the men at the smelter

"include violations of seniority,
._ loss of localautonomy, elimina-

tion of safety. committees, in-
efficiency in handling griev-
ances. ‘

The petition for an election at

_ the Iron King Mine in Humboldt

was filed on March 4, with more
than 70 percent of the workers
having signed cards. Mine-Mill
never had bargaining rights at

I this property, which produces

lead, zinc, copper, and silver. It
has been under contract with the
Steelworkers for several years.

The Mine-Mill organizers there

Gilbert Alderette of Humboldt,

working conditions are ex-
tremely bad and that numerous
safety hazards exist. They are
helping to try to get the state
mine inspector to examine the
property. ’_ I
Several other Mine-Mill local
union leaders spent a week in
Humboldt and will return after
the election date has been set.
They are being financed by
Arizona locals 915 in Ray, 886

and 939 in.Hayden, 586 in Miami,_

and 551 in Bisbee.

March 2 was the filing date of
the petition at the underground
mine in Heber City. A year ago,
Steel attempted to organize the
property, but lost an election 47
to 79 for no union.

International Repre s ent a t i v e
G. L. Buckner and Board Mem-
ber Verne ‘Curtis head the
campaign to organize the mine.

The March 16 issue of The
Nation carries an editorial
called “Forgotten Miners,”
which deals sympathetically
with the findings of the Udall
mine safety report to Con-
gress. The article notes that
the Metcalf-Montoya bill is
still in committee.

Brother Killed at
AS&R Smelter

‘OMAHA, Neb.—Duane E. Pe-
ters, employed at the AS&R
smelter here as an electrician,
was killed in an accident
March 6, being crushed between
a crane and a steel upright.

A member of Mine-Mill 461,
Peters was 26 years old. Fu-
neral services were held on
March 9 in Council Bluffs,
Iowa, with burial in the Cedar
Lawn Cemetery there.

Peters was working on a cat
walk beside the crane tracks,

“tearing down some old electri-

cal conduct, at the time of the
accident.‘ Apparently he leaned
out across the tracks just as a
crane was passing-by and he
was dragged between it and
the upright-—-a space of about
seven inches.

According to AS&R Council

aDelegate Phillip Fields, the

company here will not use red
flags or any other safety device
to slow down or stop the cranes
while men are working nearby.

Johnson in his State of the Union Message to Congress on Janu-
ary 8.

The members and the families, of our union and undoubtedly of

every union in America were thrilled. at this statement by our ‘

President. It is the first time since the administration of President
Roosevelt, 30 years ago, that a "United States President has recog-
nized the responsibility of the federal government to face up to
and tackle the appalling problem of poverty in this richest nation
on earth. . ‘
Who Are the Poor in America? _
They are the 38 million Americans—or over 25 per cent of our
total population——who attempt to live on incomes of less than
$3000 per year per family.
They are the families who live in city slums and rural shacks

which make up the 9 million. family housing units called “seriously _

deficient” by a government housing authority. These living quarters
are fire and health hazards to the men, women and children who
occupy them. A .

They are the 12 per cent of the people who the Secretary of
Labor says make up the total unemployment picture. The men
and women totally unemployed, seasonally unemployed, or em-
ployed part time who want and need full time jobs.

They are the former coal miners who held the 288,000 jobs
that were eliminated in the last 10 years in the coal industry. s

They ‘are the former steelworkers who held the 200,000 jobs
eliminated in the steel industry.

They are the auto workers,’ textile workers, oil workers, chem-
ical workers, railroad workers, longshoremen, hard rock miners
and smeltermen, factory production workers, farm hands and
white collar workers whose jobs are gone forever . . eliminated
by the machine and by automation. ‘

They are a large percentage of the youth
of America, including 50 per cent of young
Negro high school graduates in thebig cities, '
who simply can’t find steady jobs because such
jobs don’t exist today.

They are the people age 50 years or older‘
whom the -companies won’t hire because
“they’re too old” and who are too young to
retire under-Social Security. They are part
of a very large group in America between 50 '
and 65 who live in a “no man’s land” created
by rigid and stupid hiring policies of a ma-
jority of American corporations.

. What Will Our Government Do?

President Johnson has proposed a whole series of legislative
proposals to tackle the problem. Among them are tax reductions,
slum clearance, urban renewal programs, an area redevelopment;
program, youth employment legislation, revision of ‘unemployment
compensation, extension of minimum Wage laws, increasing over-
time penalty pay, medicare for the aged, more libraries, more
schools, more hospitals, more teachers, assistance to students to
keep them in school, a National Service Corps for young people
who can’t find jobs.

These are all progressive and worthwhile objectives. Every
local union and our international union should support these legisla-
tive proposals of th_e President when they come before Congress.
But it’s a long road from proposals by the President to enactment
by Congress. A good example of this are attempts to scuttle and
sabotage the civil right_s bill now going on.

One.Billion Dollars to Help the People

The entire President’s legislative program to make the “War on
Poverty” is estimated to cost one billion dollars in the next
two years. Will Congress enact this program soon? No . . . not
unless the record of Congress on legislation to help the people
improves dramatically in the period ahead. Certainly not if a hand-
ful of southern senators are permitted to tie up all legislation
with a 3-month filibuster on civil rights. _

‘But this kind of thing is par for the course in Washington. It
takes months of committee hearings, debates, compromise, etc., to
get a few million dollars appropriated for a school lunch program
to feed school kids. A 50 billion dollar military budget, on the other
hand, is passed with little debate in a few hours. The one billion
dollars the President needs to tackle poverty in America iswhat
we spend in one week on the cold war . . . and it is less than we

Skinner

"are now spending on the “brush war” in the rice paddies and

jungles of faraway South Viet Nam. _
,Will American Industry Join the War on Poverty?
The question of course, is ridiculous and the answer is “no!”
American industry, for the most part is so preoccupied with

automating and eliminating jobs and increasing" profits that they

have neither the time nor the inclination to stop.and look at the
tremendous economic problem‘ they are creating in our country.

A. good example of the “dream world” many business leaders are_ 8

living in is expressed in a booklet by the National Association of
Manufacturers. We quote a passage:

. “For the expanding, dynamic economy of America, the sky is
indeed the limit. Guided by electronics, powered by atomic energy,
geared to the smooth, effortless workings of automation, the magic
carpet of our free economy heads for distant and undreamed of
horizons. Just going alongfor the ride will be the biggest thrill on
earth.” .

Yeh, man—it’s going to be the land of milk and honey- but for
whom?

Let's Go Along tor the Ride

Whether we like it or not, the American people will be taken
for this glorious ride described in the NAM booklet.

Richard Bellman, scientist for the Rand Corporation, frankly
predicts “The output of America’s factories within 10 years will
be produced by 2 per cent of the population.”

Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz said in a speech at Michigan
University just three months ago that the average machine now
being installed in manufacturing plants has the equivalent of a high
school education built into it—-and no worries for the company
about grievances, union contracts, paid holidays and vacations,
strikes or medical plans.

Are you ready for this‘ ride that will be the biggest thrill on

earth? ”

 

 

  

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

ScIfetyCcImpcIign

Labor, Congressional Support Comes in
For Metcalf-Montoya Mine Safety Bill

Support for federal mine safety legislation, and specifically the Metcalf-Mentoya

bill, has mounted during the past month within the American labor movement and the _

U.’ S. Congress—the two major targets of a Mine-Mill educational drive launched in

February.

13

Responses have come back from many " of the Congressmen, Senators, and na-
tional and international labor organizations which received copies of the eight-page
pamphlet “A Federal Mine Safety Law Now!” _

Although Metcalf-Montoya faces the opposition of powerful mining-industry’inter-
ests, the international office of the union has received several pledges of support from
Congressmen other than the bill’s original sponsors. Many of the labor organizations
contacted have written to members of the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Com-

mittee and the House Education and Labor Committee, where the bill is now languish-

ing, urging early hearings on the measure.-

Some degree of speed on this

matter is essential if -the bill is .
' to have a chance for passage

in 1964 because Congress prob-
ably will adjourn‘ about July in
this election year.

I Enforcement Powers .
Included

The Metcalf-Montoya bill ‘ (S
1949, HR 7812), introduced last
July, calls for a federal safety
code for metal and mineral
mines, ‘implemented with real
inspection and enforcement
powers. Associated smelters, _re-
fineries, and other processing
plants would also be covered.

Another mine safety bill,
drafted by the Interior Depart-_

ment, was submitted to the Bu-

, reau of the Budget in January-

Introduction of this bill could be
several months off.

Mine-Mill's pamphlet which
strongly endorses the Metcalf-
Montoya bill, summarizes the
major findings and recom-
mendations of Interior Secretary
Stewart Uda1l’s report to Con-

gress on health and safety con’-»

ditions in metal and nonmetal
mines which is based on a two-
year study.

Some other labor‘ organiza-

tions which have indicated sup-
port for mine safety legislation

. are the United Mineworkers of _

America, the Brotherhood of
Painters, Decorators, and Paper-
hangers of America, the Inter-
national Longshoremen’s and
Warehousemen’s Union,
Amalgamated Meat Cutters and
Butcher W o r k m e n of North
America, the International Union
of Operating Engineers.

Others are the International
Association of Bridge Structural
and Ornamental Iron Workers,
the Journeymen” Barbers, Hair-
(I r e s s e r s,_ Cosmetologists and
Proprietors International Union

of America, the United Packing- .

house Workers of America, the
Brotherhood of Maintenance of
Way Employees, the National
Postal Union, the International
Woodworkers of America, the
International Association of Fire
Fighters, and the Order of Rail-
way Conductors and ‘Brakemen.
Most of these unions have said
that they will take an active
part in pushing for hearings on
the measure and in helping to
build public pressure for pas-
sage of the bill. ‘

Newspaper Support

in‘Denver, Colo., The Denver
Post has editorially supported
federal mine safety legislation

Many members of Congress, .
. while noting that they hadn’t yet

read the particular bill, prom-
ised support for reasonable na-
tional legislation in the area of
mine safety. Others, like Sena-
tors Philip A. Hart (D.-Mich.)
and George McGovern (D.-So.

J. Rivers (D.-Alaska), Ralph R.
Harding (D.-Idaho), Compton I.
White Jr. (D.-Idaho), and Sey-

of Pennsylvania, William F.
Ryan of New York, Frank

George P. Miller of California,

all Democrats.

The bill is sponsored by Sena-

The union’s legislative represen-
tative is urging early hearings
on the proposal.-

_ Early "Hearings Urged

The Packinghouse Wo rk'e r s
sent telegrams to all members
of the House and Senate com-
mittees where the bill is stalled,
urging early hearings, accord-
ing to‘Research Director John
L. Fryer, while International
Secretary-Treasurer Patrick E.
Gorman of the Amalgamated
Meat Cutters and Butcher Work-
men referred the matter to the
union’s Washington office, sug-
gesting that “they do everything
within their power to help push
through this bill.”

‘David Silvergleid, secretary-
treasurer of the National Postal
Union, states, “it seems al-

‘ most incredible that in this al-

legedly enlightened day and age
a bill as necessary and justified
as this one should languish in a

-committee.” He says that his

union has called on the congres-
sional committee to schedule
prompt hearings and is very
willing to be of further as-
sistance.

The International Woodwork-e

ers of America, with headquar-
ters in Portland, Oregon, has
written to committee chairmen
and West coast Senators and
Congressmen asking support.
Saying that his union is closely
associated with the workers in
metal and nonmetal mines, In-
ternational President A. F. Har-
tung states that the IWA has
contemplated attempting to get
the same type of federal legis-
lation passed to protect workers
in that industry.

Federal Mine Safety Law Could Help  

HE nation's coal miners have lived under

N the protection of various federal mine

safety laws for more than 20 years, but
there is no federal safety law to cover the
230,000 who work in metal and other non-coal
mines and In quam'es and sand and gravel
plants.

Yet, more than 10,000 men were injured
and 212 killed in accidents in these minesin
1962. During _a federal survey of 000 mines,
more than 12.000 safety hazards were found.
There were ladders without rungs, Iocomotlvu
without headlights, inadequate support of mine
roofs, unguarded machinery and shaft open-
ings and hundreds of other hazards.

In some states, Including Colorado, these‘

hazards are covered under state safety laws,
and the laws are widely enforced. But in
other states. both the laws and enforcement

HE STRUGGLE for equal rights now being waged by Negroes,

length and breadth of our land is, of course, first and foremost a

Av moralissue. The battle can and will be won. The thousands of

children who have defied the hoses, dogs, and cattle prods of the
Birmingham police have made that quite clear.

The focus given to the fight this year and last‘ could help to
spark a moral regeneration in the United States. Yet, aside from
that, success in the struggle against segregation andidiscrimination
will have far-reaching effects upon the economic and political life
of all our citizens-—black or white, North or South. .

It is bad enough to evade de-
cision on any major proposal of
any president. It is inexcusable
in this issue which has drawn a
curtain of uncertainty and inse-
curity over the entire nation and
over which blood has already
run in the streets.

The majority leader will pro-
pose in procedural matters but
it will rest with the Senate to
dispose. And I say in all blunt-
ness if we are to reach a point
of decision in this matter, in the
last analysis, it will be not be-
cause of what the majority
leader alone does or the major-
ity leader and the minority
leader jointly do or fail to do.
It will _ be because the whole

HAYDEN, Ariz.-Roy L. Cooksey, a member of Mine-Mill

Local 886, is the new president of the Southwest Area Conference «

of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, succeeding the Rev. L. J. Harper of Phoenix, who re-

signed because of ill health.

One of the few Negroes in the industry in Arizona, Cooksey

began work at the AS&R smelt-
er here several months ago.

Cooksey, of 1942 Irene Vista,
Tucson, has been active in the
civil rights movement for the
past 10 years and is serving
his third consecutive two-year
term as president of the Pinal
County NAACP.

In addition, he is the presi-
dent of the Lillian Cavett Ele-
mentary School P-TA, and‘was
a scoutmaster for seven years.

Last year, the National Council‘

of Christians and Jews present-
ed Cooksey and his wife with
a “Brotherhood Good Neighbor”
a w a rd on the basis of their

V wide community service.

Cooksey, who has served on
the civil rights committee of the
Arizona AFL-CIO ' C e n t r a 1
Trades Council, has organized

. a 10 c al chapter of the Negro

American Labor Council.

He attended high school in El
Paso, Texas, before coming ‘to’
Arizona. He has three girls and

three boys.

Sales Tax Fight
Still On in Buffalo

BUFFALO, N. Y. — Members
of the five Mine-Mill lo c a ls

here have distributed about 10,- - .-

000 handbills in an effort to halt ,
the drive for a sales tax hike
from one to three percent.

Locals 537, 593, 603, 813, and
941 agree that increased reve-
nues are needed by the city, but _
their position is that .sales taxes
are regressive and that a cor-
porate profits taxis more logi-
cal.

The‘Mine-Mill leaﬂets call for A
a public referendum on the is- _’

sue .

Ala. were canceled.

NEW ORLEANS, La.—Before relinquishing the heavyweight
title to Cassius Clay, who says he's a Black Muslim, Sonny Lis-
ton helped win one important battle. Through his action, show-
ings of the closed-circuit telecasts of the fight were not shown
in segregated theaters here and in some other deep South cities.

The telecast here was shifted from Loew’s State Theater,
the target of civil rights demonstrations by V the Congress of
Racial Equality, to the municipal auditorium. Scheduled show-
ings at segregated theaters in Jackson, Miss. and Montgomery,

Perhaps by the time of Clay’s first defense, the civil rights
bill, now before the Senate, will be the law of the land.

We Senators would be well
advised to search, not in the
Senate rules book, but in the
Golden Rule for the semblance
of an adequate answer to this
issue. '

Let them search among the‘

fears and the hopes of a whole
'people—a1l the American people.
And let them search in the dark
chasms of ignorance and arro-
gance which divide, and among
the slender bridges of under-
standing and humility which
unite. - ’
Even then the answers which
we shall find will be tentative,
uncertain, and inadequate. And

we should delude neither our- '

selves nor the people of the na-
tion that they will be anything
else. An issue of this magnitude
carries the accumulated action
and neglect, the accumulated
achievements and failures, the

accumulated commissions and

omissions of generations of

  Mike Mansfield on the Civil Rights Bill  

Americans. And it will take,
for many years, the combined

contribution of all the sources

of reason and unity within the
nation to bring the issue to ade-
quate resolution.

**‘k

We shall not fulfill the role in
which we are cast at this mo-
ment in the nation’s time, if
some members choose the occa-
sion to display an arrogance of
moral righteousness. I would
devoutly hope that no Senator
will cast the first stone. I would
devoutly hope that no Senator
will assume for his state a
superior enlightenment on this
issue. There are stones enough
to be thrown by all and targets

. enough for all the stones that

can be thrown. There are in-
adequacies enough and to spare
for all. There isimoral perfec-

..tion on this issue in none of us

and in no place—North, South‘,

THE MINE-MILL UNION-A

 

it March." '|964"__. 

lleul Jersey congressman  
Rated l00 Percent by IAM

NIXON, N. J.—U. S. Rep. Edward J. Patten (Dem., N.J.) has
been rated 100 percent by the International Association of Machin-
ists, which recently_ judged Congressmen on the basis of 10 votes

during the past year.

The first-term Congressman from Perth Amboy was credited
with voting “right” by favoring the expansion of the House rules

committee, construction grants.
to medical schools and student
loans, area redevelopment ex-
pansion, construction of com-
munity mental health centers,
tax reduction, college construc-
tion aid, facilities for the men-
tally retarded, and a sharply
increased vocational training
program.

The voting record appeared in
The Machinist, publication of
the IAM, which, with a mem-
bership of almost a million, is
the third largest union in the
AFL-CIO.

Shortly after Rep. Patten took
office last year, a delegation
from the seven Mine-Mill locals
in his district visited him to dis-
cuss labor problems and were
impressed by ‘his views, accord-
ing to August Nelson, recording
secretary of Local 679 here.

_Boa—rd niember Alfred Petite

Labor Groups Testify at
Ariz. Legislative Hearings..1j

 

PHOENIX, Ariz.—The Arizona Mine-Mill Council and the_AFL-‘
C10 in the state have been working, together during this legislative _
session, now drawing to "'a close, lobbying for a proposal which 
would set up a State Safety Division under the Industrial Commis-‘

sion.

/

The bill, HB134, is strongly opposed by the mining and con-E 

cripple the measure.

They would exclude any em-
ployer who has a “safety pro-
gram” from the provisions of
the bill, which, if passed, would

struction industries, which have offered amendments which would

protect ‘thousands of employees"

throughout the state through
safety inspections of various in-
dustries. Another amendment
would give employers 20 days
in which to correct "hazards
spotted by inspectors.

 Montoya Unopposed In

I

Dem Bid for U.S. Senate

SANTA FE, N. M.——U. S. Rep. J oseph_M. Montoya, unopposed at the Democratic

‘state convention here on Feb. 22, will attempt to unseat Republican Sen. Edwin L.
_Mechem in November. Although there is a primary election on May 12, it is not ex-
’ pected that the sponsor of the federal mine safety bill will have opposition at that

  . time.

I  Major_interest at the convention, which opened at 9 a.m. and lasted until "early
-Sunday morning, centered on the ‘race for "the Congresisibnal. seat being relinquished
by Montoya. In the battle were State Sen. Fabian Chavez Jr. ‘of Santa Fe, Calvin
Horn" of Albuquerque, and State Land Commissioner E. S. (Johnny). Walker._

‘Tr ‘ their names on the primary bal-
~' lot,’ but Horn has since dropped
, V * out of the race. A -
" / ' - Walker, who received just over
” ihalfof the "convention votes on
the sixth" ballot, 'will _have his

_ name onsthe top line’ of the bal-

lot—general1y considered to be -

V -“ .a great help in the primary, but

  - perhaps less important in a state
_,  like New Mexico which has had
little experience with the pre-
primary nominating convention.

 * both nominated by the conven-,‘

, tion without opposition to run

Rask   TeiIsMontana Locals  

EAST HELENA, Mont;—District 1 Board Member Barney Rask told a meeting of I‘ 5i

M

the Montana Mine-Mill Legislative Committee on Feb. 21 that two members of the V

Great‘Falls' local, one each. fromi East‘Helena and Deer Lodge, and at least two from’ " ,

Butte should run for the state legislature this year. _
He urged that each local choose the men who would have the-best chance of win-

attendance, a g r e e d that the
leadership of all locals should
interview all legislative candi-
dates before they are allowed to
have the floor to campaignat
union meetings. Their attitudes
on incre ased unemployment
compensation and workmen’s
compensation, a state minimum
wage law, improvement in the
industrial disease act, making
the state mine inspector an elec-
tive position, so-called “right-to-
work” laws, and sales taxes
should be explored, the commit-
tee decided.

Copies of voting records of the
present legislators were given
out for distribution at meetings
of the Montana locals.

The possibility of selecting
lobbyists who would attempt to
influence state legislation was
discussed, but a decision was
postponed until a future meet-
mg; I

In the area of federal legis-
lation, the committee urged
action by locals in support‘ of
the civil rights bill, medicare,
the mine safety proposal drafted
by Mine-Mill, a bill which would
provide doubletime pay for over-
time work, and a bill which
would appropriate funds for a
study of the effects _of automa-
tion. Letter-writing campaigns,
circulating petitions which will
be sent to Congressmen, secur-
ing community support (in the
case of the mine safety bill, for
example, through the use of the
Mine-Mill pamphlet) were vari-
ous techniques suggested.

John Glase, recording secre-
tary of the Butte Miners Union,
was elected chairman of the
Montana Mine-Mill Legislative
Committee for the coming term.

liberal coalition Wins Again
In S. l-'., Elects Phil Burton

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.

Officially endorsed by

Mine-Mill’s Golden Gate Refinery Workers Local 50, the

ILWU, and other labor groups, Phillip Burton, an out— -- 

spoken liberal, was elected to Congress last month, cop-
ping 52 percent of the vote in a field of seven candidates.

Final vote totals in the Feb. 18 special election to fill
the Fifth Congressional District seat vacated by the recent

victory of Mayor John F. Shelley
were: Burton, 26,269; Republi-
can Nick A. Verreos, 12,748;
Democrat Tom Flowers, 3,888;
Edward E. Heavey, a conserva-
tive Democrat, 1,225; with the
other three candidates trailing
farther behind. -

The victory was the second in
a few months for a coalition of
labor, liberal, and minority
groups, which helped make Shel-
ley the first Democratic mayor

here in 55 years in a November e

election. ,

Burton, 37, also a Democrat,
has been involved in a feud with
Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh
and was opposed by the bulk of
the press. One of the founders
of the California Democratic
Council, the huge grass roots
reform movement, he was elect-

 GRIN AND BEAR IT"*

    Editorial
INETEEN hundred sixty-four is an important election year, not
only for the country, but for our union as well. It is becoming
increasingly clear that there are many areas of interest to our
members. that lie outside the scope of collective bargaining.

The union, for example, is engaged_ in a campaign to secure
passage. of a federal mine safety bil1—Metcalf-Montoya. Its mem-
bers--and its locals have fought actively in the struggle for civil
rights. Scores of proposals have been made, and, yes, many have
reached the Congress, which Mine-Mill members could enthusias-
ticallybsupport. Medicare, broad federal aid to education, early
retirement for workers in hazardous industries, a_ 35-hour work
weekfexpanded programs to clear slums and build low-cost

housing are just a few examples.

While we could devote much space to bemoaning the fact that

legislation which would benefit the working man, and for that
matter the great majority of people in the nation, always seems
to get pigeon-holed in some Congressional committee—is thrown
into the hopper and somehow never sees the light of day again—-
we submit that it does not happen by accident.
K T.-IS DONE, and done purposefully, by the persons running
” Congress and most of the state legislatures. The answer? L_et’s
nominate and ‘elect a few new people whocan help out the pro-
gressives now‘ serving.

The liberal elements in this country can do it. What it takes
is organization and an. eagerness to work, together.

We urge the formation of Labor Political Action Committees
in all Mine-Mill 1ocals.- The international office will assist, if needed.

EGISTRATION drives mustobe -undertaken. Mine-Mill mem-

bers must be able to cast their -votes—not only in general
elections, but in the primaries as well... .

The candidates must be judged, on the-basis of their records.

and/or their pledges. This should be done before the nominating
conventions and the primaries. Otherwise, in the general election

we often will continue to have the choice of “the lesserpof two

evils.” . . , ,

Liberal-‘unity ‘must be nurtured. Too often liberals allow minor
differences to divide:them—-'overloo'king their many common goals.
I The; Wall Street Journal says that companies are going in for
politicsin aobig way‘this year. They shouldn’t be the only ones.

Politics can and do affect us all. But one other reason to get‘

involved is this—‘—it,_can..be, a lot of fun. \

“Conspiracy” Case Treated

In Recent Labor Magazine

A four-page article on “The Mine-Mill ‘Conspiracy’ Case” ap-
pears in the February-March.‘ issue j‘of—"»'Labor Today, -a bimonthly
publication de‘ali.,ng_'with current’ trends on the U. S. and Canadian

‘labor scenes. The independent journal of opinion and comment,

just entering its.t_hird year, recently requested a story on the case,

now before the U. S. Court of Appeals-

Reprints of the article, written by Honorary President John
Clark, are available at the‘D‘enver IUMM&SW headquarters.

U The article describes the
broadbase of support for the
union ‘in’ the" case, the 12-year
history of unsuccessful,‘ attacks
on the union, other examples of
the use of the “conspiracy”
charge as an anti-labor gim-

.mick. Mine-Mill’s actions re-.
. garding the Taft-Hartley Act’

and its since-repealed affidavit
provision are explained in trade
union terms, exploding the non-
sensical argument that “paral-
lelism” with Communist party
policy was due to the charged
“conspiracy.”

The article points to the
‘_‘flimsy nature of the prosecu-

:tion’s case,” noting that the

charges against five of the 11
defendants ‘ who first went to
trial have now; been dismissed
—-two by the. judged in‘ the first
trial, two "by" the Appeals Court
during the first appeal, and one
by the jury_in the second trial.

$3.18 per hour, the top helper’s
rate in the maintenance depart-

arbitration award made ~ last
month. »
Arbitrator Sam Kagel handed
down his decision on Feb. 7,
saying that the company’s de-

was unjustified.
Ingram, whohad been draw-

ing the top rate for some 10\
months, was removed from the" \.
maintenance department and‘ "

put to work on a furnace in the

production department. His pay
at that time was cut by about
-45 cents, an hour. The company
said that Ingram was not quali-
fied to hold a helper’s position.

In making his decision, Kagel

said that it was quite clear--that .‘
the company had not given In- 3
gram .-a chance to gain “wexperi-T.
ence at the type of work. its
later said “Ia helper’s position'_

. eet on Brass

CLEVELAND, Ohio~—l-‘tepresentatives of Mine-Mill,
the Steelworkers, and the United Auto Workers met here
Feb. 20 at the request of the Industrial Union Depart-

ment of the AFL-CIO to discuss labor coordination in e

bargaining with the Anaconda American Brass Company.
Although it was felt that any attempt to set common
bargaining demands would be premature, everyone agreed

that labor unity in this area was desirable and the way ‘

was left open for further meet-
ings in the future.

The meeting was co-chaired
by Steve Harris and Mrs. Mil-
dred Joiner, staff researchers
for IUD. The company’s finan-
cial position was discussed and
c o n t r a c t comparisons were
made. '

It was suggested that at sub-
sequent meetings the Montana
locals of the Anaconda Company
should be represented, and that
perhaps the locals representing
wire mills should be brought in.

Rank-and-filers from Detroit,
Toronto, and Waterbury, Conn.
as well, as three international
representatives attende d the
meeting for the UAW, while

‘Steel was represented by two

executive board members and
a sub—regional director.

Robert Brown, Sam Cooper,
George Ekes, and Stan Wenham
of Mine-Mill Local 593 in Buf-
falo, N.Y. were present, as
were International Representa-
tive Joseph Scioli and Alfred
Petit—Clair, board member of
District 5.

Petit-Clair called the meeting
“extremely positive.”

Some 7500 men work for the
Anaconda American Brass Com-
pany, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Anaconda Company. It is
a branch of the non-ferrous
metals industry that is fast be-
coming heavily automated, thus
increasing the importance of
contract provisions protecting
job security.

NEW JERSEY ZINC COMPANY has reopened another zinc
mine in eastern Tennessee—the Flat Gap, which has been closed
for over two years. The mill at the mine can handle 2,400 tons
of rock per day.

 

?i= Ii! 1!

MARTIN IIANNIFAN, manager of Montana operations for
the Anaconda Company, writes in Mining Congress Journal for
February that automation of hoisting, tramming, and materials-
handling is increasing in U.S. and Canadian underground mining.
Of particular interest, he said, is further development of rotary
boring equipment for excavating horizontal and vertical openings
without use of explosives. The type shown in the picture to the
left is for horizontal boring.

Shaft sinking with rotary drills is now possible, with hole
diameters reaching up to 15 feet and depths of 2,200 feet, depend-
ing on hardness of rock. Another method developed for raise

boring is to sink a pilot hole up to 91/2 inches in diameter, and-~

then to enlarge with a reamer pulled up through the surrounding

rock.

TEXAS GULF SULPHUR COMPANY, owner of potash mine

lives last August, announces it is now innon-ferrous metals in a
big way. Texas Gulf has been exploring Baffin Island, inside the
Arctic Circle, north of Hudson Bay, and has uncovered a tre-
mendous new deposit of zinc ore. On the basis of drilling to
date, the company says it appears there are several million tons
of ore averaging in value about.20 percent zinc. Some of the ore
is a combination of lead, zinc and silver. V
' The company, in additionto potash, is a substantial producer
of. oil and gas and the world’s largest sulphur producer. Several
years will be required before the zinc mine on Baffin Island
can be brought into production. While the mine presumably could
be operated on -a year round basis,-ice would limit the period of

shipping to a short season of’a few months each year. « - ~_

Callahan and AS&R each got a"profit of $1,436,500 out ofthe
Galena mine, which means that every man on the payroll at the

Yet any philosophy or policy
about automation must neces-
sarily start from clear recogni-
tion that unrestrained techno-
logical advance is not only inex-

-orable, but essential to the main-

tenance and elevation of the
standard of living. '
Full employment in this coun-
try is completely dependent up-
on our being more efficient‘ pro-
ducers than our competitors-in

.a world ‘where the -competition

is tougher every day. The alter-
native to automation would be
economic stagnation.

It is equally clear that the
prevalent myths about automa-
tion are narcotics dulling the na-
tional sensitivity to the neces-
sity of averting men’s mastery

- over machines. 1

The ‘myth that automation is

only a new stage in angold proc-
ess is akin to the thinking that

-splitting the atoml represented

only an evolutionary develop-
ment in the dynamics of war—.a

"projection of the first use of the

cross-bow.

The most dangerous myth is‘

that machines produce as man_y
jobs for men as they destroy and
therefore represent no threat to
workers. The machines now
have, in general, a high school
education —— in the sense that
they can do most jobs that a
high school education qualifies
people to do. So machines will
get the unskilled jobs, because
they work for less than living
wages. Machines are, in the most

real sense, responsible for put-
- ting uneducated people out of
-work. -

The jobs the’ machines create,
furthermore, are usually for dif-

ferent people from those they

displace. The bargain‘ a machine

-strikes with a man is that‘ it

takes one job and offers’ in re-
turn another—stripped of the
worker’s seniority, accrued vaca-
tion benefits, pension rights, and
the value of his skills, j “
The answers are not to smash
the machines. They are to recog-
nize that the individual versus
the machine is as unfair a match
today as the individual versus
the corporation was in the last
century, and that advancing
technology requires the exercise
of collective-—public and private
—responsibility for its effects

and collective measures to carry

out this responsibility.

copper fabricators—' ’

for U.S.
brass mills, wire mills, and
foundries combined —— since the
end of World War II. Industry
sources say 1964 will be even

better, with more production,

higher prices, and more profits.
December, 1963 brass mill busi-
ness was up 10 to 15 percent
from the same month in 1962,
and prices were upped in De-
cember, 1963, and again last
February.

Richard M. Stewart, president
of Anaconda American Brass
Company, in a year—end state-
ment, looked forward to a gradu-
al rise in brass mill product
prices in 1964. This, plus ‘in-
creased production, consolida-
tion of production facilities, and
a $9 million planned investment
in new equipment are expected
to reduce labor requirements

‘and swell profit totals. Stewart’s
outlook is typical of those of oth-
er copper fabricating executives.

Aim at Fairer Share _
Four big U.S. lead-zinc com-
panies had combined net profits
of $8,685,000 in 1962’, $18,120,000

-in 1963, and will hit close to $30,-

000,000 in 1964 even if there are

The entire February-issue of Archives of Environmentalﬂealth, a publication of

the American Medical Association, is devoted to lead—-with several of the 19 articles’
" .dealing specifically with lead poisoning. Many of thearticles are highly technical, and

others, devoted to problems in the tetraethyl lead industries, are ‘not aimed at prob-
-lems encountered by members of Mine-Mill. Some, however, are of direct interestto
workers in lead mines and smelters.

One such article is “Health Control in Inorganic Lead Industries” by Ronald E.

x .

’.Lane, an English doctor at the University of Manchester. Although noting that lead
oisoning has become-much less frequent, Dr. Lane is concerned ‘about’ excessive ex-
posure which is not sosevere as to cause immediate‘ symptoms. . «

-“This slightly poisoned man,” he says, “is ableyear after year to carry on with
his work.’ There is’ apparently little wrong with him. He complains of nothing and he
continues to do his‘ j'ob’—I maintain that it does matter, that a substantial proportion

of these men are being dam-
aged, and thatpfrom thi-s group

fcomel those who, later on, show’,

evidence of this damage andin
some cases die before they
should.” ,

-» Dr. Lane believes that these
light cases of lead poisoning

-can lead to chronic nephritis (a -:

disease of the kidney-3) and
also to cerebral hemorrhage.-
Most cases of lead poisoning

_ in Great Britain arise in about-
..~ .10 percent of the lead-using or

producing plants —- generally
-small outfits, often working on
small capital resources.

“While it is important,”--Dr. -1‘
.Lane says, “to retain the*free—‘

.dom of individuals to engage in
industry, if they feel so inclined,
one must ask how far it can be
held to be justifiable to allow
these small units, with inade-
quate capital and inadequate
medical arrangements, to carry
on a dangerous industry at the
expense of the health"of ‘many
of its workpeople.”

The author strongly endorses
-control ‘measures, which he de-
-scribes, and a recent‘ law, in

England which requires peri-

fodic examination of all~ lead
workers in‘ certain industries.
The test, which is simple and
cheap, but must be done by an
official doctor, is a- .measure-
.ment of hem oglobin in the
is a

drop in hemoglobin is felt to

wbe’ a ~ significant finding which
_warrants immediate suspension

from lead exposure and further

‘medical investigation.

“I know the value of statu-

tory examinations has b e en
questioned by s o m e authori-

ties,” says Dr. Lane, “but I

cannot agree with them. The
. improvement

in our country
over the century has been

‘greatly helped by legislation.
The method is effective. I ad-

mit that the standards imposed
must now be raised, but 1 sub-

.mit.that without legislation and
its enforcement we cannot be

sure that all work with lead is
without damage to
health.”

For Ahead of U. 5.

Dr. Lane’s article indicates
that Britain is way ahead of
this country in safety laws di-
rected at control and_preven-
tion of lead poisoning.

Dr. Rutherford T. Jolmstone
of Los Angeles, in an article on

"clinical inorganic lead intoxia-.

tion, writes of blunders in the

‘diagnosis of lead poisoning, dan-
‘gers in plants where a compe-
‘tent doctor is not employed, and

the occurrence of lead poison-

. ~ ing in plants ofall sizes.

, .Many Congressmen. and Sen-

ators are being bombarded by
letters and petitions favoring
federal mine safety legislation,
as Mine-Mill local union activity
in several areas has moved into
high gear in the past -month.

In the Coeur d’Alene district of

northern Idaho, petition circula-

tion has garnered well over 1200’
signatures. Not only Mine-Mill

"members at the Page and Ge-

lena mines, but members of the
Steelworkers Union at‘ Sunshine
and the Northwest "Metal Work-
ers at Bunker Hill are" adding
their names to the call for en-
actment of the Metcalf-Montoya
bill, now before Congress.

The petitions will go to mem-

bers. of Idaho's Congressional
delegation and to chairmen of

the Senate Interior Committee
.and’the House Labor and‘ Edu-
-cation Committee, where the bill
is awaiting hearings. - ‘ ..
:- “We agree that the present
situation in the State of Idaho

is not yet adequate,” a‘ North-

’west' statement said, but it urged

the initiation of state legislative
control. Although the union
askedthat its members not sup-
port the proposed federal legis-
lation, Mine-Mill organizers in

-the area‘ are‘ continuing to get

signatures ‘on the petitions.
