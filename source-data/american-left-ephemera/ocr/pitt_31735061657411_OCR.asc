SAID PRESIDENT TRUMAN in his veto
message of this most recent outrage against
our liberties, the McCarran Bill: “There
is no more fundamental axiom of American
freedom than the familiar statement; in a free
country, we punish men for the crimes they
commit, but never for the opinions they have.”
It is a frightening commentary that leading
administration spokesmen sponsored the fla-
grantly un-American concentration camp pro-
visions in this bill, and that U. S. Attorney
General M cGrath used discretionary power giv-
en him by this bill to arrest and hold without
bail aliens accused of holding non-conformist
opinions. Such action is unprecedented in the
U .S.A. All Americans who realize that as a
nation we are disgraced before the entire world
by this shameful legislation must call upon the
Congress which over-rode the President’s veto
to make effective the real will of our people,
which cannot tolerate the meaning of this act;
to save us from this tragic plunge toward tyran-
ny and war.

IN 1947 OUR HUSBANDS KNEW that the
highest ideals of our nation were in gravest
jeopardy. The larger aspects of the case are by
now well understood. A few questions, how-

’ ever,. recur, which we feel We would like to

  

answer as simply as possible.

1, Why did the un~American Activities Com-
mittee subpoena these men and classify them
arbitrarily as "unfriendly witnesses”?

The ten men were known. here and abroad as
serious creative artists. The material that in-
terested them was the material of real life.

Their approach to their material, Whether
screenplay, novel, short story, drama, criticism,

 

history, or on the public platform, was vital‘

and honest. They had been honored again and
again for their Work—by our government, by

10

 

the armed forces, through special awards and
prizes in their several ﬁelds, here and in other
countries. They were also known as good mem-
bers of their professional guilds and as public-
spirited citizens deeply conscious of their obliga-
tions to the national welfare. They were men
of conscience.

J. Parnell Thomas and the forces he ‘repre-
sented knew the vast importance of the motion
picture industry. America and the world might

like pictures dealing with real people, urgent.

subjects; but this was~not the way for certain
powerful Americans, seeking ways to gain more
power, to make America over in their own
image. The Thomas Committee did not allow
a single ﬁlm script of any of the Ten to be
introduced as evidence. That would have de-
stroyed this “case". What the committee said,
in essence, was: “Let us decide what pictures
are to be made; what is to be said and how;
and who shall say it. By what we do to these
few men who dare to defy us, we will be able
to frighten others into making the kind of pir-
tures we want. We will be able to use Holly-
wood for our own ends.”

In this way the ﬁlm industry was blackmailed
and brought into line with the most clear-cut
and calculated purposes of reaction in this
country. The technique is recognizable. We
have seen it before—in Germany, in every fas-
cist country. First, attack, frighten; second.
dictate; third, tell the people every day, over
and over again, what they are to think of the
result.

2_ Why do you say that the Hollywood Ten
are imprisoned not for any criminal act but for
the “offense” of defending the highest law?

The un-American Activities Committee never
claimed that the Hollywood Ten committed
any criminal act. As to the principle of privacy

ll

  

 
  

of opinion, this is what the Supreme Court
itself declared in 1943 (Barnette _case):

“If there is any ﬁxed star in the Constitu-
tional constellation, it is that no official, high
or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox
in politics, nationalism, religion, or in other
matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess
by ...word or act their faith therein.” The Su-
preme Court‘ has failed to defend and uphold
this principle. The Hollywood Ten have not-.

3, iWhy did your husbands choose to make
this test of constitutional rights at a timewhen
the public had been so inflamed by fear and
hysteria?

Because it is at such times that men must stand‘
up. That is how human freedom was won,
and how it must be held. It is easy to stand’
up for liberty when it is not being attacked;
the test comes in dangerous times when liberty
and those who ﬁght for it are endangered. Our
nation was founded and has been saved by
men who stood up. Washington, Sam Adams.
Franklin, Jefferson, Jackson, Thoreau, Gar-
rison, Phillips, Lincoln, John BroWn—they
and many more stood up against the Parnell
Thomases of theiriday.

4, Why were the Ten reluctant to reveal union
membership?-

It. was deemed important that no ‘precedent be
set for the forced revelationlof union member-
ship. The inviolability of union membership
lists has long been recognized. Labor and the
press denounced this effort of the Thomas
Committee to upset that precedent.

5, Why didn’t the Hollywood Ten answer
the so-called $64 question and tell whether or

not they were or ever had been members of '

the Communist Party?

12

 

 

At the time of the hearings Thurman Arnold,
former special assistant U. S. Attorney General,
said: “In order to test the constitutional right
of any congressional committee to ask such
questions as ‘Are you a member of the Screen
Writers Guild?’ or ‘Are you now or have you
ever been a member of the Communist Party?’
it was necessary for these witnesses to do three
things:

“First, phrase their answers as they did.
"Second, accept contempt citations.

“Third, stand trial in the Federal courts

A and if convicted of contempt appeal to the Su-

preme Court of the U. S.

“Only in this way can We have clariﬁed
this question of Constitutional law. My opin-
ion is that if the case reached the Supreme
Court, the so-called unfriendly witnesses would
be vindicated."

Unfortunately Mr. Arnold misjudged the sus-
ceptibility of the Supreme Court to the prev-
alent pressures of the time. Suppose some of
these men were communists and had yielded
to what they believed to be illegal coercion by
saying so. They would have exposed" them-
selves, their families, their friends and asso-
ciates to the spreading miasma of persecution.

' They would have been asked: “Who else?”

And if they had refused the role of informer,
the contempt charge and prison would have
followed.

Suppose they had answered‘ “No.” Anyone so
answering would have exposed himself to the
professional informers who for a fee will iden-
tify anyone under attack—Owen Lattimore,
Dean Acheson, Eleanor Roosevelt or Oscar
Chapman——as communists. In the midst of
the hullaballoo aroused by the Hollywood in-

‘vestigation, the Presidential Committee on
Civil Rights, headed by Charles E. Wilson of’

General Electric, ﬁled its report. It uttered a
grave warning about the deliberate cultivation

13

 

  

of public hysteria concerning communism. It
pointed out how closely this followed the Nazi
German pattern.

The Marion, Ohio Star, commenting. Oct.
30th, 1947, on this, said: “Will the. United
States repeat the ghastly mistake the Germans
made during the red hunt led by Adolf Hitler?
They put themselves in chains forged by

 

prejudice and fear. Nothing the reds might do ,

to this country is half so fearful as the things
Americans might do to themselves if stampeded
into losing sight of civil liberties."

6_ Why didn’t the Supreme Court face this
issue of political imprisonment?

We can only say that the Court’s failure to do
so was a tragic and astonishing blow to princi-
ples the Court itself had hitherto upheld.

To the Supreme Court was sent the second
highest number of Amicus Curiae briefs in the
Court’s entire history. These Amicus Curiae
briefs, representing many millions of people,
were ﬁled by leading American citizens and or-
ganizations asking the Court to hear the case.

Many newspapers asked editorially for the
same thing. The N. Y. Times on Nov. 2,
1947, said: “The issue raised by this case will
have to be squarely faced. We cannot penalize
persons for their beliefs. We have no right to
make them tell what their beliefs are."

In spite of these wide demands that the
Court rule on the case and the Constitutional
issues involved, it did not do so. Justice Frank-
furter has ruled, (338 U. S. 919)—“A denial
of review carries no implication whatever re-
garding, the court’s views on the merits of a
case.”

  

7, Why did the motion picture industry bow
so easily to the Thomas Committee, establish-
ing the blacklist and adjusting ﬁlm content to
the demands of the committee?

We suppose it was because the industry is con-
trolled by the great banks and ﬁnancial inter-
ests served by this committee. But ﬁlm content
has suffered.

Said the Des Moines Register, October 23,
1947: “This hounding of bold, challenging
ideas out of our arts is in the same pattern as our
current hounding of anyone who is not the
most subservient conformist. American demo-
cracy cannot be saved that way. American
democracy is not even served by such practices.
It is stultiﬁed, instead. It is corrupted and made
tawdry.”

8, How does the political imprisonment of
distinguished American writers and cultural
leaders affect United States f-o-reign public re-
lationsf’

Very badly. Our State Department has already
pointed out the adverse effect it is having on
public opinion in Europe. Both the conserva-
tive and radical press of Great Britain, France,
Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and other
countries have given much space to the Hol-
lywood Ten's imprisonment. Thousands of
protests have come from all over the world
against this action, which is termed a terrible
blow to all intellectuals, to all democracy,
everywhere.-

The International Film Conference in Rome
in the spring of 1950,~paying special honor to

the Hollywood Ten, said: “The persecution

of these American writers and ﬁlm makers is
a blow to democracy and the freedom of the
screen. All of these men have earned a high
place in the international literary and cinema

15

  

roll of honor. Their imprisonment is a most
cynical betrayal of democracy and humanity.
What is America afr-aid of? Its treatment of
these distinguished men gives the lie to the
sweet assurances of the Voice of America. How
can the U. S." oppose tyranny abroad and prac-
tice it at home?"

The report of the President's own Committee
on Civil Rights, which bears directly on the
case of our husbands, said: “The United States
is not so strong, the ﬁnal triumph of the demo-
cratic ideal is not so inevitable that we can
afford what the world now thinks of us and
our record." Let us see to it that this ﬁne
statement does not remain a mere empty phrase
on. paper.

FELLOW CITIZENS:-——-We are wives and
we are mothers and we are also citizens. We
are gravely concerned for our husbands, but,
together with our husbands, our deepest con-
cern is for’ America itself.

WE DO NOT WANT A CONCENTRA-
TION-CAMP AMERICA. We do not want
_a Nazi pattern——or anything resembling it--
here. We do not want war. You, who love
America. as we do, who love your children as
We do ours, you, the Americans who in mil-

lions of numbers truly represent our nation, are

 

needed now. You are needed, every one of
you, to speak up for peace, for the end of the
suicidal drive toward world war. —'You are
needed now to ﬁght for our basic, indispens-
able freedoms. They have been too dearly won
to be sold out cheaply. You are needed to stand
ﬁrmly and immovably between our children
and death. In our era, the death that.is im-
posed upon the mind and the creative energy
of man, and the death that comes from total
warfare are inseparable and interchangeable.

 

  

The case of the Hollywood Ten was used in
1947 as one of the “GO” signals in the drive
to undermine civil liberties ‘and prepare the
country for world war.

FELLOW CITIZENS, A REVERSAL CAN
BE MADE. In 1950 the case of the Holly~
Wood Ten can be used as 3 ‘‘STOP’' signal
against this very drive.

Each of us can act-——and must act now.

There are specific ways in which we can act.

WRITE To ATTORNEY GENERAL Mc-

-GRATH in Washington, D. C., asking him

for immediate parole for the Ten. .
WRITE TO PRESIDENT TRUMAN in the

White House, asking him for a full p-ardon‘

for these American writers so unjustly im-
prisoned. '

And you, Mr. President, by issuing pardons
for the Ten, can fulﬁll the highest obligation
of your oﬂice, and serve the cause of liberty
and peace in America and the world. «

SPEAK UP NOW, FELLOW
AMERIC/INS—L—

ACT NOW, MR. PRESIDENT—.
WHILE THERE IS YET TIME.

Sincerely «yours,

An open letter efrem:

 

 
 

 

"Those nations professing to fear our methods
mostwill soon be most closely imitating those
methods.”—ADOLPH HITLER in M ein Kampf.

"What are J. Parnell Thomas and the un-
American interests he serves afraid of? They’re
afraid of the American people. They don't
want to muzzle me. They want to muzzle
American public opinion . . . and drive us into
a disastrous and unnecessary war.”-—JOI—IN
HOWARD LAWSON, October, 1947, at the hear-
ings of the House Committee on un-American
Activities.i

“You are ‘on the eve of the Reichstag fire. For
those who remember German history in the
autumn of 1932, there is the smell of smoke
in this very room . . . This is the beginning
of concentration camps in America.”-‘—DALTON
TRUMBO to the House Committee on un-Amer-
ican Activities in 1947.

 

"Freedom, it is wonderful.”—J. PARNELL’

THOMAS, September 9, 1950, on his release
from prison.

 

Fellow Citizens:

Our husbands are in prison. We are writing
this open letter to you, the American people.
to tell you why we are so deeply proud of our
husbands, who tried to serve, with their‘ cour-
age and talents, the America they love. We
want to speak to you of our grave concern
for an America where men and women are now
imprisoned, not for any criminal act, but for
the “offense" of defending the highest con-
stitutional law against those who would betray
and subvert it.

We have heard the handcuffs click on the
wrists of our husbands. It was a small sound,
but symbolic. It still reverberates around the
world. It will always echo in our hearts and
in the hearts of our children. '

Our husbands belong to that group of writ-
ers and ﬁlm makers known throughout the
world as the Hollywood Ten. Their case has
set a precedent, forecast a pattern of what is
happening in America today.

Now the question is no longer: Can it hapl-
pen here—politica1 imprisonment, ofﬁcial black-

,list, forced confession of faith, coercion of

opinion, censorship and fear?

It has happened to our husbands—and'to many
others ‘ since.

 

    

WE ARE MOVED TO ASK YOU THESE
QUESTIONS: '

Can this beloved land, whose meaning and
traditions we cherish, be forced into a conform-
ity inimical to all we have been mos_t proud
of in the past?

Can the America of Jefferson and Jackson, of
Lincoln and Roosevelt, be degraded into the
mold of J. Parnell Thomas, Jo-hn E. Rankin,
Gerald L. K. Smith, W. R. Hearst and Senator
Joe McCarthy?

Can we stand by while designing and power-
ful men stampede us to the point where, as a
more liberal Supreme Court once said: “The
compulsory unification _of opinion will bring
only the unanimity of the graveyard.”

THE HOLLYWOOD TEN ARE IN PRISON

BECAUSE in 1947 they challenged the con-
stitutional right of J. Parnell Thomas and his
House Committee on un-American Activities to
force them to give prescribed. answers to ques-
tions about their union and political aﬂiliations.
These hearings were denounced by the respon-
sible American press and by responsible and
alert American citizens as a travesty on justice.
But they resulted in contempt of Congress in-
dictments against our men. In a time of mount-
ing hysterical pressures, the Supreme Court, by
a six to two vote, refused to rule on the grave
constitutional issue involved.

What has happened in America since 1947?

On what nightmare spectacle did J. Parnell .

Thomas raise the curtain of history when he
opened the hearings to force the blacklist and
the “compulsory uniﬁcation of opinion" on
the motion picture industry? '

 
 

For it is now conceded that this was a test
case giving the green light to extreme reaction;
that it showed how the correct mixture of
fear, hysteria and intimidation could cow the
courts, confuse and frighten people, bring a
great industry to its knees, override the‘Con-
stitution itself. ‘

What have we now? And how clearly did
the Hollywood Ten foresee it?

We have the imminence of concentration camps
—now, in our time, in our America. We
have legislation which President Truman said
“would actually p-ut the Government into the
business of thought control.” Said Dalton
Trumbo -at the Thomas Committee hearings
in 1947: "This is the beginning of concentra-
tion camps in America.”

We have war—and the drive toward the ulti-
mate disaster of World War III. Suddenly
“peace” has become a subversive word. Our

"sons face the draft and universal military train-

ing. The old, deadly spectre of European mili-
tarism now faces us. Living standards, buying
power go down. War casualties go up. But so
do proﬁts. Said John Howard Lawson in his

’statement to the Thomas Committee in 1947:

“They want to cut living standards, introduce
an economy of poverty, wipe out labor’s gains,
drive us into a disastrous and unnecessary war."

WE HAVE THE BLACKLIST. Our hus-
bands and others have been deprived of the
right to make a living in the ﬁlm industry
because they chose to make a ﬁght for constitu-
tional liberty. Now this despicable, un-Amer-
ican thing is spreading. More and more men
and women are being deprived of their liveli-
hood because their opinions do not “conform.”

THE BLACKLIST IS NOW A BUSINESS.
One branch of it is carried on commercially
by private detectives under the name of “Red
Channels" which is terrorizing radio and tele-
vision—and threatening ﬁlms, the press, and
books.

7

 

 

  

We have a kind of fear this nation has never
known before. Fear of the very principles which
made our nation great. America was born and
grew as a non-conformist nation, welcoming
and thriving on the free clash of opinion. And
now there is a blind, animal, un-American fear
of not conforming. Cities, counties, states and,
ﬁnally, the Congress of the United States it-
self pass strange laws requiring not only Com—
munists to register, but also all others who
may harbor “dangerous thoughts” or belong
to liberal, pro-democracy or peace organiza-
tions.

SAID ALBERT MALTZ in his 1947 state-
ment to the J. Parnell Thomas Committee:
“Who will be ultimately safe from this commit-
tee except members of the Ku Klux Klan?”

We have censorship, thought control, con-
formity by coercion on a scale never imagined
in America before. These are malignant growths
deadly to a free nation. They are spreading
through ﬁlms, radio, the schools, the press—
even’ in what we say to each other.

But ever increasing numbers of Americans are
banding together to protest and combat these
indecent and loathsome tendencies.

The words and warnings of the Hollywood
Ten may well become enshrined in the history
of American resistance to native tyranny.

SAID RING LARDNER, JR., as the judge
sentenced him to one year in prison for his de-
fense of freedom: “Everything I know about
the history of inquisitions and test oaths con-
firms my_conviction that there is only a minor
difference between forcing a man to say what
his opinions are and dictating what his opinions
should be. Whenever men have been compelled
to open their minds to government authority,
men’s minds have ceased to be free.”

  

From 1947 until now is_ not a long time.

It has been long enough for a corrosive evil
to ﬁnd a foothold in our land; for the spirit
of Goebbels and Himmler to ﬁnd rebirth here.
Now, in 1950, it is not only the Hollywood
Ten who have been pilloried. Now it is uni-
versity professors, government employees, labor
leaders, oﬂicials of the Communist Party, work-
ers in defense plants, churchmen and ‘others
who speak out militantly for peace, and an
ever growing, mounting list of American men
and women. _ ‘

Preventive war, concentration camps, militar-
ism, wholesale blacklisting, neighborhood spy-
ing, book bannings, the cruciﬁxion of the very
word peace—that is not the pattern of the
America we, our husbands and most other
Americans know and love.

SAID WILLIAM LANGER, North Dakota
Republican Senator, recently: "Never before has
our democracy been so seriously threatened, not
by those from without, but by those within
our own country who cry the loudest about
our American democracy, but actually attack it
whenever it affects their profits.”

SAID THE LOS ANGELES DAILY NEWS of
September 13," 1950: "Is it the communists
that the backers of the McCarran legislation

actually fear, or is it labor, and other groups, V

including numerous Democrats?”

SAID THE SENATE MINORITY RE-
PORT ON THIS LEGISLATION: “Under
the guise of protecting our democratic institu-
tions against an alleged threat of subversion
from foreign agents who seek to overthrow our
government by coercive means, we now pro-
pose to regiment the thinking of the American
people and to impair or prevent the exercise
of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.”
