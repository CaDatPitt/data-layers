by the whole membership as against the tradition of “decisions from above."
They won the league over to their new approach, and in a journal issued in
1847 only a few months before the Communist Manifesto, the group announced:

We are not among those communists who are out to destroy personal liberty,
who wish to turn the world into one huge barrack or into a gigantic workhouse.
There certainly are some communists who, with an easy conscience, refuse to
countenance personal liberty and would like to shuﬂle it out of the world
because they consider that it is a hindrance to complete harmony. But we have
no desire to exchange freedom for equality. We are convinced . . . that in no
social order will personal freedom be so assured as in a society based upon
communal ownership . . . [Let us put] our hands to work in order to establish
a democratic state wherein each party would be able by word or in writing to
win a majority over to its ideas . . .

The Communist Manifesto which issued out of these discussions proclaimed
that the ﬁrst objective of the revolution was “to win the battle of democracy."
When, two years later and after the decline of the 1848 revolutions, the Commu-
nist League split, it was in conﬂict once again with the “crude communism" of
putschism, which thought to substitute determined bands of revolutionaries for
the real mass movement of an enlightened working class. Marx told them:

The minority . . . makes mere will the motive force of the revolution, instead
of actual relations. Mlhereas we say to the workers: “You will have to go
through ﬁfteen or twenty or ﬁfty years of civil wars and international wars, not
only in order to change extant oonditions, but also in order to change your-
selves and to render yourselves ﬁt for political dominion,” you, on the other
hand, say to the workers: “We. must attain to power at once, or else we may
just as well go to sleep.” »

“In order to change yourselves and to render yourselves ﬁt for political
dominion”: this is Marx's program for the working-class movement, as against
both those who say the workers can take power any Sunday, and those who say
never. Thus Marxism came into being, in self-conscious struggle against the
advocates of the Educational Dictatorship, the Savior-Dictators, the revolutionary
elitists, the communist authoritarians, as well as the philanthropic do-gooders
and bourgeois liberals. This was Marx’s Marxism, not the caricatured monstros-
ity which is painted up with that label by both the Establishment’s professoriat,
who shudder at Marx's uncompromising spirit of revolutionary opposition to
the capitalist status quo, and also by the Stalinists and neo-Stalinists, who must
conceal the fact that Marx cut his eyeteeth by making war on their type.

“It was Marx who ﬁnally fettered the two ideas of Socialism and Democracy
together” because he developed a theory which made the synthesis possible for
the ﬁrst time. The heart of the theory is this proposition: that there is a social
majority which has the interest and motivation to change the system, and that
the aim of socialism can be the education and mobilization of this mass-majority.
This is the exploited class, the working class, from which comes the eventual
motive-force of revolution. Hence a socialism-from-below is possible, on the
basis of a theory which sees the revolutionary potentialities in the broad masses,

mest Socialism-from-Above utopias in all literature, Wells is here denouncing Marx
for this historic step.

even if they seem backward at a given time and place. Capital, after all, is noth-
ing but the demonstration of the economic basis of this proposition.

It is only some such theory of working-class socialism which makes possible
the fusion of revolutionary socialism and revolutionary democracy. We are not
arguing at this point our conviction that this faith is justiﬁed, but only insisting
on the alternative: all socialists or would-be reformers who repudiate it must go
over to some Socialism-from-Above, whether of the reformist, utopian, bureau-
cratic, Stalinist, Maoist or Castroite variety. And they do.

Five years before the Communist Manifesto, a freshly converted 23-year-old
socialist had still written in the old elitist tradition: “We can recruit our ranks
from those classes only which have enjoyed a pretty good education; that is,
from the universities and from the commercial class . . .” The young Engels
learned better; but this obsolete wisdom is still with us as ever.

4. The Myfli of Anarchist "LIber'l'urIanIsIn"

ONE or THE MOST THROUGHGOING authoritarians in the history of radicalism is
none other than the “Father of Anarchism," Proudhon, whose name is period-
ically revived as a great “libertarian" model, because.of his industrious repeti-
tion of the word liberty and his invocations to “revolution from below.”

Some may be willing to pass over his Hitlerite form of anti-Semitism (“The
Jew is the enemy of humankind. It is necessary to send this race back to Asia,
or exterminate it . . ."). Or his principled racism in general (he thought it was
right for the South to keep American Negroes in slavery, since they were the
lowest of inferior races). Or his gloriﬁcation of war for its own sake (in the
exact manner of Mussolini). Or his view that women had no rights (“I deny her
every political right and every initiative. For woman liberty and well-being lie
solely in marriage, in motherhood, in domestic duties . . .”)—that is, the
Kinder-Kirche-Kilche of the Nazis.

But it is not possible to gloss over his violent opposition not only to
trade-unionism and the right to strike (even supporting police strikebreaking),
but to any and every idea of the right to vote, universal suffrage, popular
sovereignty, and the very idea of constitutions. (“All this democracy disgusts
me . . . What would I not give to sail into this mob with my clenched ﬁstsl")
His notes for his ideal society notably include suppression of all other groups,
any public meeting by more than 20, any free press, and any elections; in the
same notes he looks forward to “a general inquisition” and the condemnation
of “several million people” to forced labor—“once the Revolution is made.”

Behind all this was a ﬁerce contempt for the masses of people—the neces-
sary foundation of Socialism-from-Above, as its opposite was the groundwork of
Marxism. The masses are corrupt and hopeless (“I worship humanity, but I
spit on men!”). They are “only savages . . . whom it is our duty to civilize,
and without making them our sovereign,” he wrote to a friend whom he scorn-
fully chided with: “You still believe in the people.” Progress can come only
from mastery by an elite who take care to give the people no sovereignty.

At one time or another he looked to some ruling despot as the one-man
dictator who would bring the Revolution: Louis Bonaparte (he wrote a whole
book in 1852 extolling the Emperor as the bearer of Revolution); Prince

11

 

Jerome Bonaparte; ﬁnally Czar Alexander II (“Do not forget that the despotism
of the czar is necessary to civilization”).

There was a candidate for the dictator’s job closer to home, of course:
himself. He elaborated a detailed scheme for a “mutualist" business, cooperative
in form, which would spread to take over all business and then the state. In
his notes Proudhon put himself down as the Manager in Chief, naturally not
subject to the democratic control he so despised. He took care of details in
advance: “Draw up a secret program, for all the managers: irrevocable elimina-
tion of royalty, democracy, proprietors, religion [and so on]."—“The Managers
are the natural representatives of the country. Ministers are only superior
Managers or General Directors: as I will be one day . . . When we are masters,
Religion will be what we want it to Be; ditto Education, philosophy, justice,
administration and government.”

The reader, who may be full of the usual illusions about anarchist “liber~
tarianism,” may ask: Was he then insincere about his great love for liberty?

Not at all: it is only necessary to understand what anarchist “liberty"
means. Proudhon wrote: “The principle of liberty is that of the Abbey of
Théléme [in Rabelais]: do what you want!” and the principle meant: “any man
who cannot do what he wants and anything he wants has the right to revolt,
even alone, against the government, even if the government were everybody
else.” The only man who can enjoy this liberty is a despot; this is the sense of
the brilliant insight by Dostoyevsky’s Shigalev: “Starting from unlimited freedom,
I arrive at unlimited despotism.”

The story is similar with the second “Father of Anarchism,” Bakunin,
whose schemes for dictatorship and suppression of democratic control are
better known than Proudhon’s.

The basic reason is the same: Anarchism is not concerned with the creation
of democratic control from below, but only with the destruction of “authority"
over the individual, including the authority of the most extremely democratic
regulation of society that it is possible to imagine. This has been made clear by
authoritative anarchist expositors time and again; for example, by George
Woodcock: “even were democracy possible, the anarchist would still not sup-
port it . . . Anarchists do not advocate political freedom. VVhat they advocate
is freedom from politics . . .” Anarchism is on principle ﬁercely anti-democratic,
since an ideally democratic authority is still authority. But since, rejecting
democracy, it has no other way of resolving the inevitable disagreements and
dilferences among the inhabitants of Théleme, its unlimited freedom for each
uncontrolled individual is indistinguishable from unlimited despotism by such
an individual, both in theory and practice.

The great problem of our age is the achievement of democratic control
from below over the vast powers of modern social authority. Anarchism, which
is freest of all with verbiage about something-from-below, rejects this goal. It is
the other side of the coin of bureaucratic despotism, with all its values turned
inside-out, not the cure or the alternative.

5. Lassulle and State Socialism

THAT VERY MODEL or A MODERN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY, the German Social-Demo-
cratic Party, is often represented as having arisen on a Marxist basis. This is a

12

myth, like so much else in extant histories of socialism. The impact of Marx
was strong, including on some of the top leaders for a while, but the politics
which permeated and ﬁnally pervaded the party came mainly from two other
sources. One was Lassalle, who founded German socialism as an organized
movement (1863); and the other was the British Fabians, who inspired Eduard
Bernstein’s “revisionism.”

Ferdinand Lassalle is the prototype of the state-soeialist—which means, one
who aims to get socialism handed down by the existing state. He was not the
ﬁrst prominent example (that was Louis Blanc), but for him the existing state
was the Kaiser's state under Bismarck.

The state, Lassalle told the workers, is something “that will achieve for
each one of us what none of us could achieve for himself.” Marx taught the
exact opposite: that the working class had to achieve its emancipation itself,
and abolish the existing state in the course. E. Bernstein was quite right in
saying that Lassalle “made a veritable cult" of the state. “The immemorial
vestal ﬁre of all civilization, the State, I defend with you against those modern
barbarians [the liberal bourgeoisie],” Lassalle told a Prussian court. This is
what made Marx and Lassalle “fundamentally opposed,” points out Lassalle’s
biographer F ootman, who lays bare his pro-Prussianism, pro-Prussian national-
ism, pro-Prussian imperialism.

Lassalle organized this ﬁrst German socialist movement as his personal
dictatorship. Quite consciously he set about building it as a mass movement
from below to achieve a Socialism-from—Above (remember Saint-Simon’s
battering-ram). The aim was to convince Bismarck to hand down concessions-
particularly universal suffrage, on which basis a parliamentary movement under
Lassalle could become a mass ally of the Bismarckian state in a coalition against
the liberal bourgeoisie. To this end Lassalle actually tried to negotiate with
the Iron Chancellor. Sending him the dictatorial statutes of his organization as
“the constitution of my kingdom which perhaps you will envy me,” Lassalle
went on:

But this miniature will be enough to show how true it is that the working
class feels an instinctive inclination towards a dictatorship, if it can first be
rightly persuaded that the dictatorship will be exercised in its interests; and
how much, despite all republican views——or rather precisely because of them-—
it would therefore be inclined, as I told you only recently, to look upon the
Crown, in opposition to the egoism of bourgeois society, as the natural repre-
sentative of the social dictatorship, if the Crown for its part could ever make
up its mind to the—-certainly very improbable—-step of striking out a really
revolutionary line and transforming itself from the monarchy of the privileged
orders into a social and revolutionary people's monarchy.

Although this secret letter was not known at the time, Marx grasped the
nature of Lassalleanism perfectly. He told Lassalle to his face that he was a
“Bonapartist,” and wrote presciently that “His attitude is that of the future
workers’ dictator.” Lassalle’s tendency he called “Royal Prussian Government
socialism," denouncing his “alliance with absolutist and feudal opponents against
the bourgeoisie."

“Instead of the revolutionary process of transformation of society,” wrote
Marx, Lassalle sees socialism arising “from the ‘state aid’ that the state gives to
the producers’ cooperative societies and which the state, not the worker, ‘calls

13

.... ...-~.~...\......m»»zn-v.m umwmmw;»....,.  .,y.... . . .

into being.’ ” Marx derides this. “But as far as the present cooperative societies
are concerned, they are of value only insofar as they are the independent
creations of the workers and not protegés either of the government or of the
bourgeoisie.” Here is a classic statement of the meaning of the word inde-
pendent as the keystone of Socialism-from-Below versus state-socialism.

There is an instructive instance of what happens when an American-type
academic anti-Marxist runs into this aspect of Marx. Mayo's Democracy and
Marxism (later revised as Introduction to Marxist Theory) handily proves that
Marxism is anti-democratic mainly by the simple expedient of deﬁning Marx-
ism as “the Moscow orthodoxy.” But at least he seems to have read Marx, and
realized that nowhere, in acres of writing and a long life, did Marx evince
concern about more power for the state but rather the reverse. Marx, it dawned
on him, was not a “statist”:

The popular criticism leveled against Marxism is that it tends to degenerate
into a form of ‘statism.’ At ﬁrst sight [i.e., reading] the criticism appears wide
of the mark, for the virtue of Marx's political theory . . . 's the entire absence
from it of any gloriﬁcation of the state.

This discovery offers a notable challenge to Marx-critics, who of course

know in advance that Marxism must glorify the state. Mayo solves the diﬂiculty
in two statements: (1) “the statism is implicit in the requirements of total
planning . . ." (2) Look at Russia. But Marx made no fetish of “total planning.”
He has so often been denounced (by other Marx-critics) for failing to draw up
a blueprint of socialism precisely because he reacted so violently against his
predecessors’ utopian “plannism" or planning-from-above. “Plannism” is pre-
cisely the conception of socialism that Marxism wished to destroy. Socialism
must involve planning, but “total planning" does not equal socialism—just as
any fool can be a professor but not every professor need be a fool.

6. The Fabian Model

IN GERMANY, BEHIND THE FIGURE or LASSALLE there shades off a series of “social-
isms” moving in an interesting direction.

The so-called Academic Socialists (“Socialists of the Chair,” Kathedersozial-
isten—a current of Establishment academics) looked to Bismarck more openly
than Lassalle, but their conception of state-socialism was not in principle alien
to his. Only, Lassalle embarked on the risky expedient of calling into being a
mass movement from below for the purpose——risky because once in motion it
might get out of hand, as indeed it did more than once. Bismarck himself did
not hesitate to represent his paternalistic economic policies as a kind of social-
ism, and books got written about “monarchical socialism,” “Bismarckian state-
socialism,” etc. Following further to the right, one comes to the “socialism” of
Friedrich List, a proto-Nazi, and to those circles where an anti-capitalist form of
anti-Semitism (Diihring, A. Wagner, etc.) lays part of the basis for the move-
ment that called itself socialist under Adolf Hitler.

The thread that unites this whole spectrum, through all the differences, is
the conception of socialism as equivalent merely to state intervention in eco-
nomic and social life. “Staat, greif zul” Lassalle called. “State, take hold of
thingsl”— this is the socialism of the whole lot. .

This is why Schumpeter is correct in observing that the British equivalent
of German state-socialism is—Fabianism, the socialism of Sidney Webb.

14

The Fabians (more accurately, the Webbians) are, in the history of the
socialist idea, that modern socialist current which developed in most complete
divorcement from Marxism, the one most alien to Marxism. It was almost
chemically-pure social-democratic reformism unalloyed, particularly before the
rise of the mass Labor and socialist movement in Britain, which it did not
want and did not help to build (despite a common myth to the contrary§. It is
therefore a very important test, unlike most other reformist currents which paid
their tribute to Marxism by adopting some of its language and distorting its
substance.

The Fabians, deliberately middle-class in composition and appeal, were
not for building any mass movement at all, least of all a Fabian one. They
thought of themselves as a small elite of brain-trusters who would permeate
the existing institutions of society, inﬂuence the real leaders in all spheres Tory
or Liberal, and guide social development toward its collectivist goal with the
“inevitability of gradualness.” Since their conception of socialism was purely in
terms of state intervention (national or municipal), and their theory told them
that capitalism itself was being collectivized apace every day and had to move

if in this direction, their function was simply to hasten the process. The Fabian

Society was designed in 1884 to be pilot-ﬁsh to a shark: at first the shark was
the Liberal Party; but when the permeation of Liberalism failed miserably, and
labor ﬁnally organized its own class party despite the Fabians, the pilot-ﬁsh
simply reattached itself.

There is perhaps no other socialist tendency which so systematically and
even consciously worked out its theory as a Socialism-from-Above. The nature
of this movement was early recognized, though it was later obscured by the
merging of Fabianism into the body of Labor reformism. The leading Christian
Socialist inside the Fabian Society once attacked Webb as “a bureaucratic Col-
1ectivist” (perhaps the ﬁrst use of that term.) Hilaire Belloc’s once-famous book
of 1912 on The Sen/ile State was largely triggered by the Webb type whose
“collectivist ideal” was basically bureaucratic. G. D. H. Cole reminisced: “The
Webbs, in those days, used to be fond of saying that everyone who was active
in politics was either an ‘A’ or a ‘B’—an anarchist or a bureaucrat—and that
they were ‘B's’ . . .”

These characterizations scarcely convey the full ﬂavor of the Webbian
collectivism that was Fabianism. It was through-and-through managerial, tech-
nocratic, elitist, authoritarian, “plannist.” Webb was fond of the term wire-
pulling almost as a synonym for politics. A Fabian publication wrotethat they
wished to be “the Jesuits of Socialism.” The gospel was Order and Eﬂiciency.

‘The people, who should be treated kindly, were ﬁt to be run only by com-

petent experts. Class struggle, revolution and popular turbulence were insanity.
In Fabianism and the Empire imperialism was praised and embraced. If ever
the socialist movement developed its own bureaucratic collectivism, this was it.

“It may be thought that Socialism is essentially a movement from below, a
class movement,” wrote a Fabian spokesman, Sidney Ball, to disabuse the reader
of this idea; but now socialists “approach the problem from the scientiﬁc rather
than the popular view; they are middle-class theorists,” he boasted, going on
to explain that there is “a distinct rupture between the Socialism of the street
and the Socialism of the chair.”

15

 

THE SEQUEL IS ALSO KNOVnv, though often glossed over. While F abianism as a
special tendency petered out into the larger stream of Labor Party reformism
by 1918, the leading Fabians themselves went in another direction. Both Sidney
and Beatrice Webb as well as Bernard Shaw—the top trio—became principled
supporters of Stalinist totalitarianism in the 19305. Even earlier, Shaw, who
thought socialism needed a Superman, had found more than one. In turn he
embraced Mussolini and Hitler as benevolent despots to hand “socialism”
down to the Yahoos, and he was disappointed only that they did not actually
abolish capitalism. In 1931 Shaw disclosed, after a visit to Russia, that the Stalin
regime was really Fabianism in practice. The Webbs followed to Moscow, and
found God. In their Soviet Communism: A New Civilization, they proved 

out of Moscow’s own documents and Stalin's own claims, industriously re- ’

searched) that Russia is the greatest democracy in the world; Stalin is no
dictator; equality reigns for all; the one-party dictatorship is needed; the Com-
munist Party is a thoroughly democratic elite bringing civilization to the Slavs
and Mongols (but not Englishmen); political democracy has failed in the West
anyway, and there is no reason why political parties should survive in our
age . . .
They staunchly supported Stalin through the Moscow purge trials and the
Hitler-Stalin Pact without a visible qualm, and died more uncritical pro-
Stalinists than can now be found on the Politburo. As Shaw has explained, the
Webbs had nothing but scorn for the Russian Revolution itself, but “The
Webbs waited until the wreckage and ruin of the change was ended, its mis-
takes remedied, and the Communist State fairly launched.” That is, they
waited until the revolutionary masses had been straitjacketed, the leaders of
the revolution cashiered, the efficient tranquillity of dictatorship had settled
on the scene, the counter-revolution ﬁrmly established; and then they came
along to pronounce it the Ideal.

Was this really a gigantic misunderstanding, some incomprehensible
blunder? Or were they not right in thinking that this indeed was the
“socialism" that matched their ideology, give or take a little blood? The swing
of Fabianism from middle-class permeation to Stalinism was the swing of a
door that was hinged on Socialism-from-Above.

If we look back at the decades just before the turn of the century that
launched Fabianism on the world, another ﬁgure looms, the antithesis of Webb:
the leading personality of revolutionary socialism in that period, the poet and
artist William Morris, who became a socialist and a Marxist in his late forties.
Morris's writings on socialism breathe from every pore the spirit of Socialism-

from-Below, just as every line of Webb’s is the opposite. This is perhaps clear-
est in his sweeping attacks on Fabianism (for the right reasons); his dislike of
the “Marxism” of that British edition of Lassalle, the dictatorial H. M. '

Hyndman; his denunciations of state-socialism; and his repugnance at the
bureaucratic-collectivist utopia of Bellamy’s Looking Backward. (The last
moved him to remark: “If they brigaded me into a regiment of workers, I'd
just lie on my back and kick.”)

Morris's socialist writings are pervaded with his emphasis from every side
on class struggle from below, in the present; and as for the socialist future, his

16

‘ha.

 

News from Nowhere was written as the direct antithesis of Bellamy’s book. He
warned
that individual men cannot shuﬂle off the business of life on to the shoulders
of an abstraction called the State, but must deal with it in conscious associa-
tion with each other . . . Variety of life is as much an aim of true Communism
as equality of condition, and . . .nothing but an union of these two will bring
about real freedom.
“Even some Socialists,” he wrote, “are apt to confuse the cooperative machinery
towards which modern life is tending with the essence of Socialism itself.” This
meant “the danger of the community falling into bureaucracy.” Therefore he
expressed fear of a “collectivist bureaucracy" lying ahead. Reacting violently
against state-socialism and reformism, he fell backwards into anti-parliamen-
tarism but he did not fall into the anarchist trap:
. . . people will have to associate in administration, and sometimes there will be
differences of opinion . . . What is to be done? Which party is to give way?
Our Anarchist friends say that it must not be carried by a majority; in that
case, then, it must be carried by a minority. And why? Is there any divine right
in a minority?
This goes to the heart of anarchism far more deeply than the common opinion
that the trouble with anarchism is that it is over-idealistic.
William Morris versus Sidney Webb: this is one way of summing up the
story.

7. The "Revisionlsf" Facade

EDUARD BERNSTEIN, THE THEORETICIAN of social-democratic “revisionism,”
took his impulsion from F abianism, by which he was heavily inﬂuenced in his
London exile. He did not invent the reformist policy in 1896: he merely
became its theoretical spokesman. (The head of the party bureaucracy pre-
ferred less theory: “One doesn't say it, one does it,” he told Bernstein, meaning
that the politics of German social-democracy had been gutted of Marxism long
before its theoreticians reﬂected the change.)

But Bernstein did not “revise” Marxism. His role was to uproot it while
pretending to prune away withered limbs. The Fabians had not needed to
bother with pretense, but in Germany it was not possible to destroy Marxism
by a frontal attack. The reversion to Socialism-from-Above (“die alte Scheisse”)
had to be presented as a “modernization,” a “revision.”

Essentially, like the Fabians, “revisionism” found its socialism in the in-
evitable collectivization of capitalism itself; it saw the movement toward social-
ism as the sum of the collectivist tendencies immanent in capitalism itself; it
looked to the “self-socialization” of capitalism from above, through the insti-
tutions of the existing state. The equation of Statiﬁcation=Socialism is not the
invention of Stalinism; it was systematized by the Fabian-Revisionist-State-social-
ist current of social-democratic reformism.

Most of the contemporary discoveries which announce that socialism is
obsolete, because capitalism no longer really exists, can already be found in
Bernstein. It was “absurd” to call Weimar Germany capitalist, he declared,
because of the controls exercised over the capitalists; it follows from Bernstein-
ism that the Nazi state was even more anti-capitalist, as advertised . . .

17

 

The transformation of socialism into a bureaucratic collectivism is already
implicit in Bernstein's attack on, workers’ democracy. Denouncing the idea of
workers’ control of industry, he proceeds to redeﬁne democracy. Is it “govem-
ment by the people”? He rejects this, in favor of the negative deﬁnition “absence
of class government.” Thus the very notion of workers’ democracy as a sine qua
non of socialism is junked, as effectively as by the clever redeﬁnitions of de-
mocracy current in the Communist academies. Even political freedom and rep-
resentative institutions have been deﬁned out: a theoretical result all the more
impressive since Bernstein himself was not personally anti-democratic like
Lassalle or Shaw. It is the theory of Socialism-from-Above which requires these

formulations. Bernstein is the leading social-democratic theoretician not only

of the equation Statiﬁcation=Socialism, but also of the disjunction of socialism
from workers’ democracy.

It was ﬁtting, therefore, that Bernstein should come to the conclusion that
Marx’s hostility to the state was “anarchistic,” and that Lassalle was right in
looking to the state for the initiation of socialism. “The administrative body
of the visible future can be different from the present-day state only in degree,”
wrote Bernstein; the “withering away of the state" is nothing but utopianism
even under socialism. He, on the contrary, was very practical; for example, as
the Kaiser's non-withering state launched itself into the imperialist scramble
for colonies, Bernstein promptly came out for colonialism and the White
Man's Burden: “only a conditional’ right of savages to the land occupied by
them can be recognized; the higher civilization ultimately can claim a higher
right.”

Bernstein contrasted his own vision of the road to socialism with that of
Marx: Marx’s “is the picture of an army. It presses forward, through detours,
over sticks and stones . . . Finally it arrives at a great abyss. Beyond it there
stands beckoning the desired goal--the state of the future, which can be reached
only through a sea, a red sea as some have said.” In contrast, Bernstein's vision
was not red but roseate: the class struggle softens into harmony as a
beneﬁcent state gently changes the bourgeoisie into good bureaucrats. It didn’t
happen that way—when the Bernsteinized social-democracy first shot down the
revolutionary left in 1919, and then, reinstating the unregenerate bourgeoisie
and the military in power, helped to yield Germany into the hands of the
fascists.

If Bernstein was the theoretician of the identiﬁcation of bureaucratic col-
lectivism with socialism, then it was his left-wing opponent in the German
movement who became the leading spokesman in the Second International of a
revolutionary-democratic Socialism-from-Below. This was Rosa Luxemburg, who
so emphatically put her faith and hope in the spontaneous struggle of a free
working class that the myth-makers invented for her a "theory of spontaneity"
which she never held, a theory in which “spontaneity” is counterposed to
“leadership.”

In her own movement she fought hard against the “revolutionary” elitists
who rediscovered the theory of the Educational Dictatorship over the workers
(it is rediscovered in every generation as The Very Latest Thing), and had to
write: “Without the conscious will and the conscious action of the majority of
the proletariat there can be no socialism . . .”--“[VVe] will never assume govern-

l8

 

mental authority except through the clear unambiguous will of the vast
majority of the German working class . . .” And her famous aphorism: “Mis-
takes committed by a genuinely revolutionary labor movement are much more
fruitful and worthwhile historically than the infallibility of the very best
Central Committee."

Rosa Luxemburg versus Eduard Bernstein: this is the German chapter of
the story.

8. The 100% American Scene

AT THE WELLSPRINGS or AMERICAN “NATIVE soc1AL1sM,” the picture is the same,
only more so. If we overlook the imported “German socialism" (Lassallean
with Marxist trimmings) of the early Socialist Labor Party, then the leading
ﬁgure here is, far and away, Edward Bellamy and his Looking Backward (1887).
Just before him came the now-forgotten Laurence Gronlund, whose Cooperative
Commonwealth (1884) was extremely inﬂuential in its day, selling 100,000
copies.

Gronlund is so up-to-date that he does not say he rejects democracy—he
merely “redeﬁnes” it; as “Administration by the Competent," as against “gov-
ernment by majorities,” together with a modest proposal to wipe out repre-
sentative government as such as well as all parties. All the “people” want, he
teaches, is “administration—good administration.” They should find! “the right
leaders,” and then be “willing to thrust their whole collective power into
their hands." Representative government will be replaced by the plebiscite. He
is sure that his scheme will work, he explains, because it works so well for the
hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Naturally he rejects the horrible idea of
class struggle. The workers are incapable of self-emancipation, and he spe-
ciﬁcally denounces Marx's famous expression of this First Principle. The
Yahoos will be emancipated by an elite of the “competent,” drawn from the
intelligentsia; and at one point he set out to organize a secret conspiratorial
American Socialist Fraternity for students.

Bellamy’s socialist utopia in Looking Backward is expressly modeled on the
army as the ideal pattern of socie.ty—regimented, hierarchically ruled by an
elite, organized from the top down, with the cozy communion of the beehive
as the great end. The story itself pictures the transition as coming through
the concentration of society into one big business corporation, a single capital-
ist: the state. Universal suffrage is abolished; all organizations from below
eliminated; decisions are made by administrative technocrats from above. As
one of his followers deﬁned this “American socialism”: “Its social idea is a
perfectly organized industrial system which, by reason of the close interlocking
of its wheels, shall work at a minimum of friction with a maximum of wealth
and leisure to all."

As in the case of the anarchists, Bellamy’s fanciful solution to the basic
problem of social organization—how to resolve differences of ideas and interests
among men—is the assumptiotn that the elite will be superhumanly wise and
incapable of injustice (essentially the same as the Stalinist-totalitarian myth of
the infallibility of the Party), the point of the assumption being that it makes
unnecessary any concern about democratic control from below. The latter is

unthinkable for Bellamy because the masses, the workers, are simply a danger-
ous monster, the barbarian horde. The Bellamyite movement-which called itself
“Nationalism” and originally set out to be both anti-socialist and anti-capitalist
was systematically organized on a middle-class appeal, like the Fabians.

Here were the overwhelmingly popular educators of the “native” wing of
American socialism, whose conceptions echoed through the non-Marxist and
anti-Marxist sectors of the socialist movement well into the 20th century,
with a resurgence of “Bellamy Clubs" even in the 1930s, when John Dewey
eulogized Looking Backward as expounding “the American ideal of democracy.”
Technocracy, which already reveals fascist features openly, was a lineal de-
scendant of this tradition on one side. If one wants to see how thin the line
can be between something called socialism and something like fascism, it is
instructive to read the monstrous exposition of “socialism” written by the once-
famous inventor-scientist and Socialist Party luminary Charles P. Steinmetz.
His America and the New Epoch (1916-) sets down in deadly seriousness exactly
the anti-utopia once satirized in a science-ﬁction novel, in which Congress has
been replaced by direct senators from DuPont, General Motors and the other
great corporations. Steinmetz, presenting the giant monopolistic corporations
(like his own employer, General Electric) as the ultimate in industrial efficiency,
proposes to disband the political government in favor of direct rule by the
associated corporate monopolists.

Bellamyism started many on the road to socialism, but the road forked.
By the turn of the century, American socialism developed the world's most
vibrant antithesis to Socialism-from-Above in all its forms: Eugene Debs. In
1897 Debs was still at the point of asking none other than John D. Rockefeller
to finance the establishment of a socialist utopian colony in a western state; but
Debs, whose socialism was forged in the class struggle of a militant labor move-
ment, soon found his true voice.

The heart of “Debsian socialism” was its appeal to, and faith in, the self-
activity of the masses from below. Debs’ writings and speeches are impregnated
with this theme. He often quoted or paraphrased Marx's “First Principle” in
his own words: “The great discovery the modern slaves have made is that they
themselves their freedom must achieve. This is the secret of their solidarity;
the heart of their hope . .  His classic statement is this:

Too long have the workers of the world waited for some Moses to lead them
out of bondage. He has not come; he never will come. I would not lead you out
if I could; for if you could be led out, you could be led back again. I would
have you make up your minds that there is nothing you cannot do for your-
selves.

He echoed Marx's words of 1850:

In the struggle of the working class to free itself from wage slavery it cannot
be repeated too often that everything depends on the working class itself. The
simple question is, Can the workers ﬁt themselves, by education, organization,
cooperation and self-imposed discipline, to take control of the productive forces
and manage industry in the interest of the people and for the beneﬁt of
society? That is all there is to it.

Can the workers ﬁt themselves . . . He was under no starry-eyed illusions about
the working class as it was (or is). But he-proposed a different goal than the

20

 

elitists whose sole wisdom consists in pointing a ﬁnger at the backwardness of
the people now, and in teaching that this must always be so. As against the
faith in elite rule from above, Debs counterposed the directly contrary notion
of the revolutionary vanguard (also a minority) whose faith impels them to
advocate a harder road for the majority:

It is the minorities who have made the history of this world [he said in the
1917 anti-war speech for which Wilson's government jailed him]. It is the few
who have had the courage to take their places at the front; who have been
true enough to themselves to speak the truth that was in them; who have dared
oppose the established order of things; who have espoused the cause of the
suffering, struggling poor; who have upheld without regard to personal con-
sequences the cause of freedom and righteousness.

This “Debsian socialism” evoked a tremendous response from the heart of
the people, but Debs had no successor as a tribune of revolutionary-democratic
socialism. After the postwar period of radicalization, the Socialist Party became
pinkly respectable on the one hand, and the Communist Party became Stalin-
ized on the other. On its side, American liberalism itself had long been under-
going a process of “statiﬁcation,” culminating in the great New Deal illusion of
the '30s. The elite vision of a dispensation-from-above under the aegis of the
Savior-President attracted a whole strain of liberals to whom the country gentle-
man in the White House was as Bismarck to Lassalle.

The type had been heralded by Lincoln Steffens, the collectivist liberal
who (like Shaw and Georges Sorel) was as attracted to Mussolini as to Moscow,
and for the same reasons. Upton Sinclair, quitting the Socialist Party as too
“sectarian,” launched his “broad” movement to “End Poverty in California,"
with a manifesto appropriately called I, Governor of California, and How I
Ended Poverty (probably the only radical manifesto with two I’s in the title)
on the theme of "Socialism-from-Up-in-Sacramento.” One of the typical ﬁgures
of the time was Stuart Chase, who wove :1 zigzag course from the reformism
of the League for Industrial Democracy to the semi-fascism of Technocracy.
There were the Stalinoid intellectuals who managed to sublimate their joint
admiration for Roosevelt and Russia by hailing both the NRA and the Moscow
Trials. There were signs of the times like Paul Blanshard, who defected from
the Socialist Party to Roosevelt on the ground that the New Deal program of
“managed capitalism” had taken the initiative in economic change away from
the socialists.

The New Deal, often rightly called America's “social-democratic period,”
was also the liberals’ and social-democrats’ big ﬂing at Socialism-from-Above, the
utopia of Roosevelt's “people's monarchy.” The illusion of the Rooseveltian
“revolution from above” united creeping-socialism, bureaucratic liberalism,

- Stalinoid elitism, and illusions about both Russian collectivism and collectivized

capitalism, in one package.

9. Six Strains of Socialism-from-Above

WE HAVE SEEN THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL different strains or currents running
through Socialism~from-Above. They are usually intertwined, but let us separate
out some of the more important aspects for a closer look.

(1) Philanthropism.—Socialism (or “freedom,” or what-have-you) is to be

21

  

handed down, in order to Do the People Good, by the rich and powerful out of
the kindness of their hearts. As the Communist Manifesto put it, with the early
utopians like Robert Owen in mind, “Only from the point of view of being the
most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them.” In gratitude, the
downtrodden poor must above all avoid getting rambunctious, and no nonsense
about class struggle or self-emancipation. This aspect may be considered a
special case of-

(2) Elitism.—We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that social-
ism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and there-
fore guarateed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a
mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class
is likely to see its goal as an Educational Dictatorship over the masses-—to
Do Them Good, of course—the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party
which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-
Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's “Supennen," by eugenic manipulators, by
Proudhon’s “anarchist” managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more
modern equivalents—with up-todate terms and new verbal screens which can
be hailed as fresh social theory as against “nineteenth-century Marxism.”

On the other hand, the revolutionary-democratic advocates of Socialism-
from-Below have also always been a minority, but the chasm between the
elitist approach and the vanguard approach is crucial, as we have seen in the
case of Debs. For him as for Marx and Luxemburg, the function of the revolu-
tionary vanguard is to impel the mass-majority to ﬁt themselves to take power
in their own name, through their own struggles. The point is not to deny
the critical importance of minorities, but to establish a different relationship
between the advanced minority and the more backward mass.

(3) Planm°sm.—The key words are Efﬁciency, Order, Planning, System—and
Regimentation. Socialism is reduced to social-engineering, by a Power above
society. Here again, the point is not to deny that effective socialism requires
over-all planning (and also that efficiency and order are good things); but the
reduction of socialism to planned production is an entirely different matter;
just as effective democracy requires the right to vote, but the reduction of
democracy merely to the right to vote once in a while makes it a fraud.

As a matter of fact, it would be important to demonstrate that the separa-
tion of planning from democratic control-from-below makes a mockery of plan-
ning itself; for the immensely complicated industrial societies of today cannot
be effectively planned by an all-powerful central committee's ukases, which
inhibit and terrorize the free play of initiative and correction from below.
This is indeed the basic contradiction of the new type of exploiting social
system represented by Soviet bureaucratic collectivism. But we cannot pursue
this subject further here.

The substitution of Plannism for socialism has a long history, quite apart
from its embodiment in the Soviet myth that Statiﬁcation=Socialism, a tenet
which we have already seen to have been first systematized by social-democratic
reformism (Bernstein and the Fabians particularly). During the l930’s, the
mystique of the “Plan,” taken over in part from Soviet propaganda, became
prominent in the right wing of the social-democracy, with Henri de Man hailed
as its prophet and as successor to Marx. De Man faded from view and is now

22

 

 

forgotten because he had the bad judgment to push his Revisionist theories
first into corporatism and then into collaboration with the Nazis.

Aside from theoretical constructions, Plannism appears in the socialist
movement most frequently embodied in a certain psychological type of radical.
To give credit due, one of the ﬁrst sketches of this type came in Belloc's The
Seruile State, with the Fabians in mind. This type, writes Belloc,

loves the collectivist ideal in itself . . . because it is an ordered and regular form
of society. He loves to consider the ideal of a State in which land and capital
shall be held by public oﬂicials who shall order other men about and so
preserve them from the consequences of their vice, ignorance and folly. [Belloc
[writes further:] In him the exploitation of man excites no indignation. Indeed,
he is not a type to which indignation or any other lively passion is familiar . . .
[Belloc’s eye is on Sidney Webb here.] . . . the prospect of a vast bureaucracy
wherein the whole of life shall be scheduled and appointed to certain simple
schemes. . . gives his small stomach a ﬁnal satisfaction.

As far as concerns contemporary examples with a pro-Stalinist coloration,
examples-a-go go can be found in the pages of Paul Sweezy’s magazine Monthly
Review.

In a 1930 article on the “motive patterns of socialism,” written when he
still thought he was a Leninist, Max Eastman distinguished this type as centered
on “efﬁciency and intelligent organization . . . a veritable passion for a plan . . .
businesslike organization.” For such, he commented, Stalin's Russia has a fas-
cination:

It is a region at least to he apologized for in other lands—certainly not de-

nounced from the standpoint of a mad dream like emancipation of the workers

and therewith all mankind. In those who built the Marxian movement and

those who organized its victory in Russia, that mad dream was the central

motive. They were, as some are prone now to forget, extreme rebels against

oppression. Lenin will perhaps stand out, when the commotion about his ideas

subsides, as the greatest rebel in history. His major passion was to set men

free . . . if -a single concept must be chosen to summarize the goal of the class

struggle as deﬁned in Marxian writings, and especially the writings of Lenin,
human freedom is the name for it . . .

It might be added that more than once Lenin decried the push for total-

planning as a “bureaucratic utopia.”

There is a subdivision under Plannism which deserves a name too: let us
call it Productionism. Of course, everyone is “for” production just as everyone
is for Virtue and the Good Life; but for this type, production is the decisive
test and end of a society. Russian bureaucratic collectivism is “progressive”
because of the statistics of pig-iron production (the same type usually ignores
the impressive statistics of increased production under Nazi or Japanese
capitalism). It is all right to smash or prevent free trade-unions under Nasser,
Castro, Sukarno or Nkrumah because something known as “economic develop-
ment” is paramount over human rights. This hardboiled viewpoint was, of
course, not invented by these “radicals,” but by the callous exploiters of labor
in the capitalist Industrial Revolution; and the socialist movement came into
existence ﬁghting tooth-and-nail against these theoreticians of “progressive"
exploitation. On this score too, apologists for modern “leftist” authoritarian
regimes tend to consider this hoary doctrine as the newest revelation of
sociology.

23

 

(4) “Communionism.”—In his 1930 article Max Eastman called this “the
united-brotherhood pattern,” of “the gregarian or human-solidarity socialists”
—“those yearning with a mixture of religious mysticism and animal gregarious-
ness for human solidarity.” It should not be confused with the notion of
solidarity in strikes, etc., and not necessarily identiﬁed with what is commonly
called comradeship in the socialist movement or a “sense of community” else-
where. Its speciﬁc content, as Eastman says, is a “seeking for submersion in a
Totality, seeking to lose himself in the bosom of a substitute for God.”

Eastman is here pointing to the Communist Party writer Mike. Gold; an-
other excellent case is Harry F. Ward, the CP’s hardy clerical fellow-traveler,
whose books theorize this kind of “oceanic” yearning for the shucking-off of
one’s individuality. Be1lamy’s notebooks reveal him as a classic case: he writes
about the longing “for absorption into the grand omnipotency of the universe;”
his “Religion of Solidarity” reﬂects his mistrust of the individualism of the
personality, his craving to dissolve the Self into communion with Something
Greater.

This strain is very prominent in some of the most authoritarian of the
Socialisms-from-Above and is not seldom met in milder cases like the philan-
thropic elitists with Christian Socialist views. Naturally, this kind of “com-
munionist” socialism is always hailed as an “ethical socialism" and praised
for holding class struggle in» horror; for there must be no conflict inside a bee-
hive. It tends to ﬂatly counterpose “col1ectivism” to “individualism” (a false
opposition from a humanist standopint), but what it really impugns is individ-
uality. 5

(5) Permeationism.—Socialism.-from-Above appears in many varieties for
the simple reason that there are always many alternatives to the self-mobilization
of masses from below; but the cases discussed tend to divide into two families.

One has the perspective of overthro-wing the present, capitalist hierarchical
society in order to replace it with a new, non-capitalist type of hierarchical
society based on a new kind of elite ruling class. (These varieties are usually
ticketed “revolutionary” in histories of socialism.) The other has the perspec-
tive of permeating the centers of power in the existing society in order to
metamorphose it—gradually, inevitably—into a statiﬁed collectivism, perhaps
molecule by molecule the way wood petriﬁes into agate. This is the character-
istic stigmatum of the reformist, social-democratic varieties of Socialism-from-
Above.

The very term permeationism was invented for self-description by what
we have already called the “purest” variety of reformism ever seen, Sidney
Webb's Fabianism. All social-democratic permeationism is based on a theory
of mechanical inevitability: the inevitable self-collectivization of capitalism from
above, which is equated with socialism. Pressure from below (where considered
permissible) can hasten and‘ straighten the process, provided it is kept under
control to avoid frightening the self-collectivizers. Hence the social-democratic
permeationists are not only willing but anxious to “join the Establishment”
rather than to ﬁght it, in whatever capacity they are allowed to join it, whether
as cabin boys or cabinet ministers. Typically the function of their movement-
from-below is primarily to blackmail the ruling powers into buying them off
with such opportunities for permeation.

24

 

The tendency toward the collectivization of capitalism is indeed a reality:
as we have seen, it means the bureaucratic collectivization of capitalism. As this
process has advanced, the contemporary social-democracy has itself gone through
a metamorphosis. Today, the leading theoretician of this neo-reformism, C. A.
R. Crosland, denounces as “extremist” the mild statement favoring national-
ization which was originally written for the British Labor program by none
other than Sidney Webb (with Arthur Henderson)! The number of conti-
nental social-democracies that have now purged their programs of all speciﬁcally
anti-capitalist content—a brand new phenomenon in socialist history-reﬂects
the degree to which the ongoing process of bureaucratic collectivization is
accepted as an installment of petriﬁed “socialism.”

This is permeationism as grand strategy. It leads, of course, to permeationism
as political tactic, a subject we cannot here pursue beyond mentioning its
presently most prominent U.S. form: the policy of supporting the Democratic
Party and the lib-lab coalition around the “Johnson Consensus,” its predeces-
sors and successors. A

The distinction between these two “families” of Socialism-from-Above holds
for home grown socialisms, from Babeuf to Harold Wilson; that is, cases where
the social base of the given socialist current is inside the national system, be it
the labor aristocracy or déclassé elements or any other. The case is somewhat
different for those “socialisms-from-outside” represented by the contemporary
Communist Parties, whose strategy and tactics depend in the last analysis on a
power base outside any of the domestic social strata; that is, on the bureau-
cratic-collectivist ruling classes in the East.

The Communist Parties have shown themselves uniquely different from any
kind of home-grown movement in their capacity to alternate or combine both
the “revolutionary"-oppositionist and the permeationist tactics to suit their
convenience. Thus the American Communist Party could swing from its ultra-
left-adventurist “Third Period" of 1928-34 into the ultra-permeationist tactic
of the Popular Front period, then back into ﬁre-breathing “revolutionism”
during the Hitler-Stalin Pact period, and again, during the ups-and-downs oi
the Cold War, into various degrees of combination of the two. With the current
Communist split along Moscow-Peking lines, the “Khrushchevites” and the Mao-
ists tend each to embody one of the two tactics which formerly alternated.

Frequently, therefore, in domestic policy the oﬂicial Communist Party and
the social-democrats tend to converge on the policy of permeationism, though
from the angle of a different Socialism-from-Above.

(6) Socialism-from-0uIside.— The preceding varieties of Socialism-from-
Above look to power at the tops of society: now we come to the expectation of
succor from the outside.

The ﬂying-saucer cult is a pathological form, messianism a more traditional
form, when “outside” means out of this world; but for present purposes
“outside” means outside the social struggle at home. For the Communists of
East Europe after World War II, the New Order had to be imported on Rus-
sian bayonets; for the German Social-Democrats in exile, liberation of their
own people could ﬁnally be imagined only by grace of foreign military victory.

The peacetime variety is socialism.-by-model-example. This, of course, was
the method of the old utopians, who built their model colonies in the American

25

 

backwoods in order to demonstrate the superiority of their system and convert
the unbelievers. Today, it is this substitute for social struggle at home which is
increasingly the essential hope of the Communist movement in the West.

The model-example is provided by Russia (or China, for the Maoists); and
while it is diflicult to make the lot of the Russian proletarians half-attractive
to Western workers even with a generous dose of lies, there is more success to
be expected from two other approaches:

(a) The relatively priveleged position of managerial, bureaucratic and
intellectual-flunky elements in the Russian collectivist system can be pointedly
contrasted with the situation in the West, where these same elements are sub-
ordinated to the owners of capital and manipulators of wealth. At this point
the appeal of the Soviet system of statiﬁed economy coincides with the historic
appeal of middle-class socialisms, to disgruntled class-elements of intellectuals,
technologists, scientists and scientiﬁc employees, administrative bureaucrats and

organization men of various types, who can most easily identify themselves with "
a new ruling class based on state power rather than on money power and.
ownership, and therefore visualize themselves as the new men of power in am

non-ca italist but elitist setu .
P P

(b) While the oﬁicial Communist Parties are required to maintain the
facade of orthodoxy in something called “Marxism-Leninism,”

do free themselves from the pretense. One development is the open abandon-

ment of any perspective of victory through social struggle inside the capitalist ,.«._

countries. The “world revolution” is equated simply with the demonstration

_ by the Communist states that their system is superior. This has now been put

into thesis-form by the two leading theoreticians of neo-Stalinism, Paul Sweezy
and Isaac Deutscher.

Baran and Sweezy’s Monopoly Capitalism (1966) ﬂatly rejects “the answer
of traditional Marxist orthodoxy—that the industrial proletariat must event-
ually rise in revolution against its capitalist oppressors.” Same for all the other
“outsider” groups of society—unemployed, farm workers, ghetto masses. etc.;
they cannot “constitute a coherent force in society.” This leaves no one; capital-
ism cannot be effectively challenged from within. What then? Some day, the
authors explain on their last page, “perhaps not in the present century,” the
people will be ‘disillusioned with capitalism “as the world revolution spreads
and as the socialist countries show by their example that it is possible" to build
a rational society. [Emphasis added.] That is :11]. Thus the Marxist phrases
filling the other 366 pages of this essay become simply an incantation like the
reading of the Sermon on the Mount at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

The same perspective is presented less bluntly by a more circurnlocuitous
writer in Deutscher’s The Great Contest. Deutscher transmits the new Soviet
theory “that Western capitalism will succumb not so much—or not directly-
because of its own crises and inherent contradictions as because of its inability
to match the achievements of socialism [i.e. the Communist states]”; and later
on: “It may be said that this has to some extent replaced the Marxist pros-
pect of a permanent social revolution.” Here we have a theoretical rationale
for what has long been the function of the Communist movement in the West:
to act as border guard and shill for the competing, rival establishment in the

This type of neo-Stalinist ideologist is often critical of the actual Soviet
regime-—a good example is Deutscher, who remains as far as possible from being
an uncritical apologist for Moscow like the oﬂicial Communists. They must be
understood as being permeationists with respect to bureaucratic-collectivism.
VVhat appears as a “socialism-fromroutside” when seen from the capitalist
world, becomes a sort of Fabianism when viewed from within the framework
of the Communist system. Within this context, change-from-above-only is as
ﬁrm a principle for these theoreticians as it was for Sidney Webb. This was
demonstrated inter alia by Deutscher’s hostile reaction to the East German
revolt of 1953 and to the Hungarian revolution of 1956, on the classical ground
that such upheavals from below would scare the Soviet establishment away
from its course of “liberalization” by the Inevitability of Gradualness.

‘I0. Which Side Are You On?

FROM THE POINT or VIEW or INTELLECTUALS who have a choice of roles to play
in the social struggle, the perspective of Socialism-from-Below has historically
had little appeal. Even within the framework of the socialist movement it has
had few consistent exponents and not many inconsistent ones. Outside the so
cialist movement, naturally, the standard line is that such ideas are visionary,
impractical, unrealistic, “utopian”; idealistic perhaps but quixotic. The mass
of people are congenitally stupid, corrupt, apathetic and generally hopeless; and
progressive change must come from Superior People rather like (as it hap-
pens) the intellectual expressing these sentiments. This is translated theoretically
into an Iron Law of Oligarchy or a tinny law of elitism, in one way or another
involving a crude theory of inevitability—the inevitability of change-from-above-
only.

Without presuming to review in a few words the arguments pro and con
for this pervasive view, we can note the social role it’ plays, as the self-justiﬁ-
catory rite of the elitist. In “normal” times when the masses are not moving,

As mentioned in the Note, following are a few useful titles, but for most of
the questions dealt with, one must go back to the sources.

Thought, which discusses Pythagoras somewhat too. For Proudhon, see the chapter in
J. S. Schapiro’s Liberalism and the Challenge of Fascism, and Proudhon’s Carnets.

East. Above all, the perspective of Socialism-from:-Below becomes as alien to
these professors of bureaucratic collectivism as to the apologists for capitalism
in the American academies.

the theory simply requires pointing with scorn, while the whole history of
revolution and social upheaval is simply dismissed as obsolete. But the recur-
rence of revolutionary upheavals and social disturbances, deﬁned precisely by
the intrusion onto the historical stage of previous inactive masses and char-
acteristic of periods when basic social change is on the agenda, is just as
“normal” in history as the intervening periods of conservatism. When the elit-
ist theorist therefore has to abandon the posture of the scientiﬁc observer who
is merely predicting that the mass of people will always continue quiescent,
when he is faced with the opposite reality of a revolutionary mass threatening to
subvert the structure of power, he is typically not behindhand in switching
over to: an entirely different track: denouncing mass intervention from below
-as evil ‘in itself.

The fact is that the choice between Socialism-from-Above and Socialism-
from-Below is, for the intellectual, basically a moral choice, whereas for the
working masses who have no social alternative it is "a matter of necessity. The
intellectual may have the option of “joining the Establishment" where the
worker does not; the same option holds also for labor leaders, who, as they
rise out of their class, likewise confront a choice that did not exist before.
The pressure of conformity to the mores of the ruling class, the pressure for
bourgeoisiﬁcation, is stronger in proportion as personal and organizational
ties with the ranks below become weak. It is not hard for an intellectual or
bureaucratized official to convince himself that permeation of and adaptation
to the existing power is the smart way to do it, when (as it happens) it also
permits sharing in the perquisites of inﬂuence and affluence.

It is an ironic fact, therefore, that the “Iron Law of Oligarchy” is iron-
clad mainly for the intellectual elements from whom it arises. As a social
stratum (i.e., apart from exceptional individuals) intellectuals have never been
known to rise against established power in anything like the way that the
modern working class has done time and again through its relatively brief
history. Functioning typically as the ideological ﬂunkies of the established
rulers of society, the brain-worker sector of the non-propertied middle classes is
yet, at the same time, moved to discontent and disgruntlement by the relation-
ship. Like many another servant, this Admirable Crichton thinks, “I am a
better man than my master, and if things were different we would see who
should bend the knee.” More than ever in our day, when the credit of the
capitalist system is disintegrating throughout the world, he easily dreams of a
form of society in which he can come into his own, in. which the Brain and
not Hands or Moneybags would dictate; in which he and his similars would be
released from the pressure of Property through the elimination of capitalism,
and released from the pressure of the more numerous masses through the
elimination of democracy.

Nor does he have to dream very far, for existing versions of such a society
seem to be before his eyes, in the Eastern collectivisms. Even if he rejects these
versions, for various reasons including the Cold War, he can theorize his own
version of a “good” kind of bureaucratic collectivism, to be called “Meritoc-

racy” or "managen'alism” or “Industrialism” or what-have-you, in the U.S.; or
“African Socialism” in Ghana and “Arab Socialism” in Cairo; or various other
kinds of socialism in other parts of the world.

The nature of the choice between Socialism-from-Above and Socialism-from-
Below stands out most starkly in connection with a question on which there is \
a considerable measure of agreement among liberal, social-democratic and
Stalinoid intellectuals today. This is the alleged inevitability of authoritarian
dictatorships (benevolent despotisms) in the newly developing states of Africa
and Asia particularly—e.g. Nkrumah, Nasser, Sukarno, et al.—dictatorships which
'crush independent trade unions as well as all political opposition and organize
to maximize the exploitation of labor, in order to extract from the hides of the
working masses suﬂicient capital to hasten industrialization at the tempo which
the new rulers desire. Thus to an unprecedented degree, “progressive" circles
which once would have protested injustice anywhere have become automatic
apologists for any authoritarianism which is considered non-capitalist.

Apart from the economic-determinist rationale usually given for this posi-
tion, there are two aspects of the question which illuminate what is broadly at
stake:

.- (a) The economic argument for dictatorship, purporting to prove the nec-
essity of breakneck industrialization, is undoubtedly very weighty for the new
bureaucratic rulers—who meanwhile do not stint their own revenue and ag-
grandizement—but it is incapable of persuading the worker at the bottom of
the heap that he and his family must bow to super-exploitation and super-
sweating for some generations ahead, for the sake of a quick accumulation of
capital. (In fact, this is why breakneck industrialization requires dictatorial
controls.)

The economic-determinist argument is the rationalization of a ruling-class
viewpoint; it makes human sense only from a ruling-class viewpoint, which of
course is always identiﬁed "with the needs of “society." It makes equally good
sense that the workers at the bottom o-f the heap must move to ﬁght this super-
exploitation to defend their elementary human dignity and wellbeing. So was
it also during the capitalist In.dustrial Revolution, when the “newly developing
states” were in Europe.

' It is not a question simply of some technical-economic argument but of
sides in a class struggle. The question is: Which side are you on?

(b) It is argued that the mass of people in these countries are too backward
to control the society and its government; and this is no doubt true, not only
there. But’ what follows? How does a people or a class become ﬁt to rule in
their own name?

Only by ﬁghting to- do so. Only by waging their struggle against oppression
—oppression by those who tell them they are unﬁt to govern. Only by ﬁghting
for democratic power do they educate themselves and raise themselves up to
the level of being able to wield that power. There has never been any other
way for any class.

_ Although we have been considering a particular line of apologia, the two
points which emerged do in fact apply all over the world, in every country,
advanced or developing, capitalist or Stalinist. When the demonstrations and
boycotts of the Southern Negroes threatened to embarrass President Johnson

Soc1ALxsM’s CRISIS TODAY is a crisis in the meaning of socialism.

For the ﬁrst time in the history of the world, very likely a majority of its
people label themselves “socialist” in one sense or another; but there has never
been a time when the label was less informative. The nearest thing to a common
content of the various “socialisms” is a negative: anti-capitalism. On the positive
side, the range of conﬂicting and incompatible ideas that call themselves socialist
is wider than the spread of ideas within the bourgeois world.

Even anti-capitalism holds less and less as a common factor. In one part of
the spectrum, a number of social-democratic parties have virtually eliminated
any speciﬁcally socialist demands from their programs, promising to maintain
private enterprise wherever possible. The most prominent example is the Ger-
man social-democracy. (“As an idea, a philosophy, and a social movement,
socialism in Germany is no longer represented by a political party,” sums up
D. A. Chalmers’ recent book The Social Democratic Party of Germany.) These
parties have deﬁned socialism out of existence, but the tendency which they
have formalized is that of the entire reformist social-democracy. In what sense
are these parties still “socialist”?

In another part of the world picture, there are the Communist states, whose
claim to being, “socialist” is based on a negative: the abolition of the capitalist
private-proﬁt system, and the fact that the class which rules does not consist of
private owners of property. On the positive side, however, the socio—economic
system which has replaced capitalism there would not be recognizable to Karl
Marx. The state owns the means of production—but who “owns” the state?
Certainly not the mass of workers, who are exploited, unfree, and alienated from
all levers of social and political control. A new class rules, the bureaucratic
bosses; it rules over a collectivist system—a bureaucratic collectivism. Unless
statiﬁcation is mechanically equated with “socialism,” in what sense are these
societies “socialist”?

These two self-styled socialisms are very different, but they have more in
common than they think. The social-democracy has typically dreamed of “social-
izing” capitalism from above. Its principle has always been that increased state
intervention in society and economy is per se socialistic. It bears a fatal family
resemblance to the Stalinist conception of imposing something called socialism
from the top down, and of equating statiﬁcation with socialism. Both have their
roots in the ambiguous history of the socialist idea.

Back to the roots: the following pages propose to investigate the meaning
of socialism historically, in a new way. There have always been different “kinds

as he faced an election, the question was: Which side are you on? Vvhen the‘
Hungarian people erupted in revolt against the Russian occupier, the question
was: Which side are you on? When the Algerian people fought for liberation
against the “socialist" government of Guy Mollet, the question was: Which side
are you on? When Cuba was invaded by Washington's puppets, the question
was: Which side are you on? and when the Cuban trade unions are taken over
by the commissars of the dictatorship, the question is also: Which side are
you on? ‘ ‘ »
Since the beginning of society, there has been no end of theories “proving"
that tyranny is inevitable and that freedom-in-democracy is impossible; there is
no more convenient ideology for a ruling class and its intellectual ﬂunkies.
These are self-fulﬁlling predictions, since they remain true only as long as they
are taken to be true. In the last analysis, the only way of proving them false
is in the struggle itself. That struggle from below has never been stopped by
the theories from above, and it has changed the world time and again. To
choose any of the forms of Socialism-from-Above is to look back to the old
world, to the “old crap.” To choose the road of Socialism~from-Below is to
affirm the beginning of a new world.

THE INDEPENDENT SOCIALIST COMMlTTEE'S

Independent Socialism stands for a
policy completely independent of and
opposed to both of the reactionary sys-
tems of exploitation of man by man
which now divide the world: capitalism
and totalitarian Communism. it stands
for uncompromising support to every
democratic movement of the people
against all capitalist or Communist re-
gimes, and to every movement for social
emancipation from their power.

Capitalism is an outlived system
whose lifeblood is private profit and
corporate oppression, even when repre-
sented as a “welfare state" or mixed
economy," and even when its govern-
ment is administered by liberals or
social-democrats. In the midst of a false
prosperity based on a Permanent War
Economy, it still perpetuates poverty,
unemployment, racism and imperialism.

The so-called Communist regimes-
of Stalin or Khrushchev or their heirs.
Titoists, Maoists, or other—have nothing
in common with our socialism. They
represent a new type of totalitarian
exploitive state, based on a social sys-
tem in which the state owns the means
of production but only the ruling bur-
eaucratic class “owns” or controls the
state. The various Communist Parties
are essentially political agents of this
class, not allies of socialism. This ruling
class may concede reforms under
pressure, like all other rulers, but the
limits of such reform are set by the fact
that it will not willingly give up its
totalitarian state control or reform itself
outof power.

Socialism—a new social system in
which the people own and control the
basic sectors of the economy—cannot
exist without the fullest effective demo-
cratic control from below, of all social
and governmental institutions. The so-
cialist movement must be a movement
of opposition and alternatives to the
ruling Establishments, seeking to fight
them from below, not relying on per-

 

meation from above. We look to the
working class and its ever-present
struggle as the basic progressive force
in society.

We stand for a policy of complete
independence from and opposition to
both war camps, capitalist and Com-
munist. which are engaged in an imper-
ialist struggle to dominate the world.
We are for strengthening all tendencies
toward a Third Camp of those who
reject both war blocs and their military
preparations for a nuclear catastrophe.
We advocate a democratic, anti-imper-
ialist foreign policy, -instead of the Cold
War power-politics of either Washington
or Moscow-Peking.

The Independent Socialist Committee
is an unaffiliated educational center,
not a party or action group, but its
education, based on the ideas of revolu-
tionary Marxism, seeks to aid socialists
in their participation in every current
struggle to better the people's lot now:

o-For independent political action
in opposition to both old parties, by the
labor and civil rights movements and
other progressive forces, looking to the
building of a new party.

0-For a left-wing and anti-bureau-
cratic force in the labor movement.

o-For militancy and a Third Camp
policy in the peace movement.

o-For full support to all militant
struggles for complete civil rights for
Negroes, and against appeasement of
either white-supremacism or white-lib-
eralism.

o-For full civil liberties to all, in-
cluding Communists and fascists, and
against the reactionary “anti-Commun-
ism" which is the American Establish-
ment’s mask for political witchhunting.

This view of socialism is both demo-
cratic and revolutionary, both humanist
and working-class; and it is only as a
revolutionary-democratic movement
that socialism presents a third choice
for the world, as the alternative to both
capitalism and Communism.

of socialism,” and they have customarily been divided into reformist or revo-
lutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc. These divisions
exist, but the underlying division is something else. Throughout the history of
socialist movements and ideas, the fundamental divide is between Socialism-
Fram-A bo-ue and Socialism-From-Below.

What unites the many different forms of Socialism-from-Above is the con-
ception that socialism (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) must be handed down
to the grateful masses in "one form or another, by a ruling elite which is not
subject to their control in fact. The heart of Socialism-from-Below is its view
that socialism can be realized only through the self-emancipation of activized
masses in motion, reaching out for freedom with their own hands, mobilized
“from below” in a struggle to take charge of their own destiny, as actors (not
merely subjects) on the stage of history. “The emancipation of the working
classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves”: this is the ﬁrst
sentence in the Rules written for the First International by Marx, and this is
the First Principle of his life-work.

It is the conception of Socialism-from-Above which accounts for the ac-
ceptance of Communist dictatorship as a form of “socialism." It is the concep-
tion of Socialism-from-Above which concentrates social-democratic attention on
the parliamentary superstructure of society and on the manipulation of the
“commanding heights” of the economy, and which makes them hostile to mass

NOTE .

This is a completely rewritten and expanded version of a study which originally
appeared in the socialist student magazine "Anvil" (Winter I960) and was subsequently
reprinted two or three times elsewhere. The framework. the general content. and some
passages remain. but I have taken advantage of this new edition to malte a thorough
revision of what was a hasty first draft.

The aim is not to give a history of socialist thought in a nutshell. but simply to
illustrate a thesis-—the thesis being a historical interpretation of the meaning of socialism
and of how socialism came to mean what it does today. To this end I have selected for
discussion a few of the most important socialist currents up to the early 20th century.
since the obiect cf the inquiry is the wellsprings of the modern socialist movement. There
are a number of tendencies which would have been difficult to treat "briefly. and are there-
fore not discussed here at all. such as syndicalism. DeLeonism. Bolshevism. the IWW. the
collectivist liberals. etc.; but I believe that their study leads‘ to the same conclusions.

The chief difficulty in treating the subiect briefly is the heavy encrustation of myth
over the written history of socialism. At the end I have listed a very few worlts which are
especially useful for some of the figures discussed here: for others the interested reader
simply has to go baclt to the sources. There is no half-decent history of socialist thought
extant today: and there probably will not be one until more socialist scholars do the ltind
of iob that E. P. Thompsonn did for William Morris. whose image had been almost oblit-
erated by the myths. ~

Speaking of William Morris. l re-read "A Dream of John Ball." and came once again
across the oft-quoted passage about-—- Well. let us quote it again. as motto for the fol-
lowing pages:

". . . l pondered all these things. and how men tight and lose the battle. and the
thing that they fought for comes about in spite of their defeat. and when it comes
turns out not to be what they meant. and other men have to fight for what they
meant under another name. . . ."

. action from below. It is Socialism-from-Above which is the dominant tradition

in the development of socialism.

Please note that it is not peculiar to socialism. On the contrary, the
yearning for emancipation-from-above is the all-pervading principle through
centuries of class society and political oppression. It is the permanent promise
held out by every ruling power to keep the people looking upward for protec-
tion, instead of to themselves for liberation from the need for protection. The
people looked to kings to right the injustices done by lords, to messiahs to
overthrow the tyranny of kings. Instead of the bold way of mass action from
below, it is always safer and more prudent to ﬁnd the “good” ruler who will
Do the People Good. The pattern of emancipation-from-above goes all the
way back in the history of civilization, and had to show up in socialism too.
But it is only in the framework of the modern socialist movement that liberation
from below could become even a realistic aspiration; within socialism it has
come to the fore, but only by ﬁts and starts. The history of socialism can be
read as a continual but largely unsuccessful effort to free itself from the old
tradition, the tradition of emancipation-from-above.

In the conviction that the current crisis of socialism is intelligible only in
terms of this Great Divide in the socialist tradition, we turn to a few examples
of the two souls of socialism.

I. Some Socialis-l' "Ances-|'ors"

KARL KAUTSKY, THE LEADING THEORETICIAN of the Second International, began
his book on Thomas More with the observation that the two great ﬁgures in-
augurating the history of socialism are More and Miinzer, and that both of
them “follow the long line of Socialists, from Lycurgus and Pythagoras to
Plato, the Gracchi, Cataline, Christ . . ."

This is a very impressive list of early “socialists,” and considering his
position Kautsky should certainly have been able to recognize a socialist when
he saw one. VVhat is most fascinating about this list is the way it falls apart
under examination into two quite different groups.

Plutarch's life of Lycurgus led the early socialists to adopt him as the
founder of Spartan “communism”—this is why Kautsky lists him. But as de-
scribed by Plutarch, the Spartan system was based on equal division of land
under private ownership; it was in no way socialistic. The “collectivist” feeling
one may get from a description of the Spartan regime comes from a different
direction: the way of life of the Spartan ruling class itself, which was organized
as a pennanent disciplined garrison in a state of siege; and to this add the
terroristic regime imposed over the helots (slaves). I do not see how a modern
socialist can read of the Lycurgan regime without feeling that he is meeting
not an ancestor of socialism but a forerunner of fascism. There is quite a dif-
ference! but how is it that it did not impress itself on the leading theoretician
of social-democracy?

Pythagoras founded an elite order which acted as the political arm of the
landed aristocracy against the plebeian-democratic movement; he and his party
were ﬁnally overthrown and expelled by a popular revolutionary rising. Kautsky
seems to be on the wrong side of the barricades! But besides, inside the Pyth-
agorean order a regime of total authoritarianism and regimentation prevailed.

5

   

  

 

In spite of this, Kautsky chose to regard Pythagoras as a socialist ancestor be-
cause of the belief that the organized Pythagoreans practised communal con-
sumption. Even if this were true (and Kautsky found out later it was not) this
would have made the Pythagorean order exactly as communistic as any mon-
astery. Chalk up a second ancestor of totalitarianism on Kautsky’s list.

The case of Plato's Republic is well-enough known. The sole element of
“communism" in his ideal state is the prescription of monastic-communal con-
sumption for the small elite of “Guardians” who constitute the bureaucracy and
army; but the surrounding social system is assumed to be private-property-
holding, not socialistic. And—here it is again—Plato’s state model is government
by an aristocratic elite, and his argument stresses that democracy inevitably
means the deterioration and ruin of society. Plato's political aim, in fact, was
the rehabilitation and puriﬁcation of the ruling aristocracy in order to ﬁght the
tide of democracy. To call him a socialist ancestor is to imply a conception of
socialism which makes any kind of democratic control irrelevant.

On the other hand, Catiline and the Gracchi had no collectivist side. Their
names are associated with mass movements of popular-democratic revolt against
the Establishment. They were not socialists, to be sure, but they were on the
popular side of the class struggle in the ancient world, the side of the people's
movement from below. It seems it was all the same to the theoretician of social-
democracy.

Here, in the pre-history of our subject, are two kinds of ﬁgures ready-made
for adoption into the pantheon of the socialist movement. There were the
ﬁgures with a tinge of (alleged)_collectivism, who were yet thorough elitists,
authoritarians and anti-democrats; and there were the ﬁgures without anything
collectivistic about them, who were associated with democratic class struggles.
There is a collectivist tendency without democracy, and there is a democratic
tendency without collectivism but nothing yet which merges these two currents.

Not until Thomas Miinzer, the leader of the revolutionary left wing of
the German Reformation, do we ﬁnd a suggestion of such a merger; a social
movement with communistic ideas (Miinzer’s) which was also engaged in a deep-
going popular-democratic struggle from below. In contrast is precisely Sir
Thomas More: the gulf between these two contemporaries goes to the heart
of our subject. More's Utopia pictures "a thoroughly regimented society, more
reminiscent of 1984 than of socialist democracy, elitist through and through,
even slaveholding, a typical Socialism-from-Above. It is not surprising that, of
these two “socialist ancestors" who stand at the threshold of the modern world,
one (More) execrated the other and supported the hangmen who did him and
his movement to death.

What then is the meaning of socialism when it ﬁrst came into the world?
From the very beginning, it was divided between the two souls of socialism,
and there was war between them.

2. The Firs'I' Modern Socialisis

MODERN SOCIALISM WAS BORN in the course of the half century or so that lies
between the Great French Revolution and the revolutions of 1848. So was
modern democracy. But they were not born linked like Siamese twins. They
traveled at ﬁrst along separate lines. When did the two lines ﬁrst intersect?

6

 

 

 

Out of the wreckage of the French Revolution rose different kinds of social-
ism. We will consider three of the most important in the light of our question.

I. Babeuf. — The ﬁrst modern socialist movement was that led in the last
phase of the French Revolution by Babeuf (“the Conspiracy of the Equals”),
conceived as a continuation of revolutionary Jacobinism plus a more consistent
social goal: a society of communist equality. This represents the first time in
the modern era that the idea of socialism is wedded to the idea of a popular
movement—a momentous combination.‘

Thislombination immediately raises a critical question: What exactly in
each case is the relationship that is seen between this socialist idea and that
popular movement? This is the key question for socialism for the next 200 years.

As the Babouvists saw it: The mass movement of the people has failed;
the people seem to have turned their backs on the Revolution. But still they
suffer, still they need communism: we know that. The revolutionary will of the
people has been defeated by a conspiracy of the right: what we need is a cabal
of the left to re-create the people’s movement, to effectuate the revolutionary
will. We must therefore seize power. But the people are no longer ready to
seize power. Therefore it is necessary for us to seize power in their name, in
order to raise the people up to that point. This means a temporary dictator-
ship, admittedly by a minority; but it will be an Educational Dictatorship,
aiming at creating the conditions which will make possible democratic control
in the future. (In that sense we are democrats.) This will not be a dictatorship
of the people, as was the Commune, let alone of the proletariat; it is frankly
a dictatorship over the people—with very good intentions.

For most of the next ﬁfty years, the conception of the Educational Dic-
tatorship over the people remains the program of the revolutionary left-
through the three B's (Babeuf to Buonarroti to Blanqui) and, with anarchist
verbiage added, also Bakunin. The new order will be handed down to the
suffering people by the revolutionary band. This typical Socialism-from-Above
is the ﬁrst and most primitive form of revolutionary socialism, but there are
still today admirers of Castro and Mao who think it is the last word in
revolutionism.

II. Saint-Simon.—Emerging from the revolutionary period, a brilliant mind
took an entirely different tack. Saint-Simon was impelled by a revulsion against
revolution, disorder and disturbances. What fascinated him was the potentialities
of industry and science.

His vision had nothing to do with anything resembling equality, justice,
freedom, the rights of man or allied passions: it looked only to modernization,
industrialization, planning, divorced from such considerations. Planned indus-
trialization was the key to the new world, and obviously the people to achieve
this were the oligarchies of ﬁnanciers and businessmen, scientists, technologists,
managers. When not appealing to these, he called on Napoleon or his successor
Louis XVIII to implement schemes for a royal dictatorship. His schemes varied,
but they were all completely authoritarian to the last planned ordinance. A
systematic racist and a militant imperialist, he was the furious enemy of the

 

‘Strictly speaking, this combination had been anticipated by Gerrard Winstanley
and the “True Levelers,” the left wing of the English Revolution; but it was for-
gotten and led to nothing, historically speaking.

very idea of equality and liberty, which he hated as offspring of the French
Revolution.

It was only in the last phase of his life (1825) that, disappointed in the
response of the natural elite to do their duty and impose the new modernizing
oligarchy, he made a turn toward appealing to the workers down below. The
“New Christianity” would be a popular movement, but its role would be simply
to convince the powers-that-be to heed the advice of the Saint-Simonian plan-
ners. The workers should organize—to petition their capitalists and managerial
bosses to take over from the “idle classes."

What then was his relationship between the idea of the Planned Society
and the popular movement? The people, the movement, could be useful as a
battering-ram-in someone’s hands. Saint-Simon's last idea was a movement-
from-below to eﬁectuate a Socialism-from-Above. But power and control must
remain where it has always been-—above.

III. The Utopians. — A third type of socialism that arose in the post-
revolutionary generation was that of the utopian socialists proper—Robert
Owen, Charles Fourier, Etienne Cabet, etc. They blueprinted an ideal com-
munal colony, imagined fullblown from the cranium of the Leader, to be
ﬁnanced by the grace of the philanthropic rich under the wing of Benevolent
Power.

Owen (in many ways the most sympathetic of the lot) was as categorical as
any of them: “This great change . . . must and will be accomplished by the rich
and powerful. There are no other parties to do it . . . it is a waste of time,
talent and pecuniary means, for the poor to contend in opposition to the rich
and powerful. . .” Naturally he was against “class hate,” class struggle. Of the
many who believe this, few have written so bluntly that the aim of this “social-
ism" is “to govern or treat all society as the most advanced physicians govern
and treat their patients in the best arranged lunatic hospitals,” with “for-
bearance and kindness" for the unfortunates who have “become so through
the irrationality and injustice of the present most irrational system of society.”

Cabet’s society provided for elections, but there could be no free discussion;
and a controlled press, systematic indoctrination, and completely regimented
uniformity was insisted on as part of the prescription.

For these utopian socialists, what was the relationship between the socialist
idea and the popular movement? The latter was the flock to be tended by the
good shepherd. It must not be supposed that Socialism-from-Above necessarily
implies cruelly despotic intentions.

This side of these Socialisms-from-Above is far from outlived. On the con-
trary, it is so modem that a modern writer like Martin Buber, in Paths in
Utopia, can perform the remarkable feat of treating the old utopians as if
they were great democrats and “libertarians"l This myth is quite widespread,
and it points once again to the extraordinary insensitivity of socialist writers
and historians to the deeprooted record of Socialism-from-Above as the dom-
inant component in the two souls of socialism.

3. Wluli Marx Did

UTOPIANISM WAS ELITIST AND ANTI-DEMOCRATIC to the core because it was utopian
—that is, it looked to the prescription of a prefabricated model, the dreaming-

8

 

 

 

up of a plan to be willed into existence. Above all, it was inherently hostile
to the very idea of transforming society from below, by the upsetting interven-
tion of freedom-seeking masses, even where it ﬁnally accepted recourse to the
instrument of a mass movement for pressure upon the Tops. In the socialist
movement as it developed before Marx, nowhere did the line of the Socialist
Idea intersect the line of Democracy-from-Below.

This intersection, this synthesis, was the great contribution of Marx: in
comparison, the whole content of his Capital is secondary. What he fused was
revolutionary socialism with revolutionary democracy. This is the heart of
Marxism: “This is the Law; all the rest is commentary.” The Communist Mani-
festo of 1848 marked the self-consciousness of the ﬁrst movement (in Engels’
words) "whosenotion was from the very beginning that the emancipation of
the working class must be the act of the working class itself.”

The young Marx himself went through the more primitive stage just as
the human embryo goes through the gill stage; or to put it differently, one of
his ﬁrst immunizations was achieved by catching the most pervasive disease of
all, the illusion of the Savior-Despot. I/Vhen he was 22, the old kaiser died,
and to the hosannahs of the liberals Friedrich Wilhelm IV acceded to the
throne amidst expectations of democratic reforms from above. Nothing of the
sort happened. Marx never went back to this notion, which has bedeviled all
of socialism with its hopes in Savior-Dictators or Savior-Presidents.

Marx entered politics as the crusading editor of a newspaper which was
the organ of the extreme left of the liberal democracy of the industrialized
Rhineland, and soon became the foremost editorial voice of complete political
democracy in Germany. The ﬁrst article he published was a polemic in favor
of the unqualiﬁed freedom of the press from all censorship by the state. By the
time the imperial government forced his dismissal, he was turning to ﬁnd out
more about the new socialist ideas coming from France. ‘When this leading
spokesman of liberal democracy became a socialist, he still regarded the task
as the championing of democracy—except that democracy now had a deeper
meaning. Marx was the ﬁrst socialist thinker and leader who came to socialism
through the struggle for liberal democracy.

In manuscript notes made in 1844, he rejected the extant “crude commu-
nism” which negates the personality of man, and looked to a communism
which would be a “fully developed humanism.” In 1845 he and his friend
Engels worked out a line of argument against the elitism of a socialist current
represented by one Bruno Bauer. In 1846 they were organizing the “German
Democratic Communists" in Brussels exile, and Engels was writing: “In our
time democracy and communism are one.” “Only the proletarians are able to
fraternize really, under the banner of communist democracy

In working out the viewpoint which ﬁrst wedded the new communist idea
to the new democratic aspirations, they came into conflict with the existing
communist sects such as that of Weitling, who dreamed of a messianic dic---
tatorship. Before they joined the group which became the Communist League

(for which they were to write the Communist Manifesto), they stipulated that
the organization be changed from an elite conspiracy of the old type into an

I open propaganda group, that “everything conducive to superstitious authori-

tarianism be struck out of the rules,” that the leading committee be elected
