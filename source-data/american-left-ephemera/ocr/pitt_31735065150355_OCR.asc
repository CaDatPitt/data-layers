“Board Acts on Lead and Zinc

Other Legislation

DENVER-_-The crisis in the ‘non-ferrous -metals in-
dustry occupied a major share of the attention of Mine-

Mil1’s International Executive‘ board when it held its

first post-convention meeting at_ the Cosmopolitan hotel

here, June 3 through June 8.

The most significant ac-
tion taken. in its Week-long.
session was the adoption of a
program designed to ease‘ the
crucial job and market crisis
(See
Page 1 story.) “‘Our nation,”
said .the board, “can ill af-
ford the severe consequences
to defense and to the economy.

resulting from the destruc-V

tive effects of closing down

many mines unable to operate’

within the present price and
market‘ structure.” I
OTHER ACTION S‘
Other important Executive
Board actions were as follows:

l. It charged that the limita-_

tion of the effective use of
labor’s economic and political
strength was the principal tar-
get of big business and -its
political friends in the current
Senate “racket” investigations.
(See. Page 8.) ‘ '

2. It asked for “a full-dress
investigation by Congress of
the economic life of the na-
tion,” declaring that such an
inquiry will “bring the truth
to the country” about the rea-
sons for inflation and high
prices. (See Page 8.)

 It declared that reductions

The I» Sluppreme Court

Jencks Victory Clears    
Mine-Mill's Good Name  

(Special to ‘Mine-Mill“ Union)

WASHINGTON, D. C.——For the second time Within“, 
a few months, the Supreme Court of the UnitedpStates« '
cleared the good name of the International Union of g »
Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. On June 3, the top’ 
judges of democratic«America set aside the conviction 

of Clinton Jencks, one-time’
president of Mine-Mill -Lo-
cal 890. in Bayard, N. M. It

‘vindicated the ‘union which
had appealed the conviction‘

and upheld its repeated! con-

. tention that charges of “com-

munism” a g a i n s t Mine-Mill
were the fabrications of lying

‘ witnesses.

In an earlier case the court
unanimously affirmed Mine-
Mill’s bargaining rights under
Taft-Hartley. ‘ H

The Supreme Court ruled-

that Jencks had been con-
victed unfairly, asserting in its
opinion that the defense was
entitled to examine stoolpi_g-
eon _reports to. the‘FBI to de-
termine whether = their trial
testimony differed from what
they had secretly told the gov-

_ ernment police. — '

, CONTRADICTIONS

Defense counsel‘ had asked
for copies of the reports made
to the FBI by witnesses
against J encks. The reason for
this was to prove that these
FBI r e p o r t s were different
from their courtroom testi-

"many and ‘ that these 

lied and that his FBI reports
would prove this fact. ‘
In its "decision, the Sn-
preme Court ruled that the .
defense was entitled to these

witnesses. were telling the
truth. Thus, the court has
made it impossible for paid

and. unpaid stoolies to lie.
without fear of contra.dic-.-
tion by their own previous " ‘
testimony, either orally or “ 

b in writing to the FBI.

New York PAC .

Political Action Committee
members , Pat Pacile and Lu-
cius Thomas of Buffalo Brass
Workers Union No. 593 and
Int’l Rep. Joe Scioli were on
hand last month at the special
session of the Republican-con
trolled New York Legislature
W h i c h re-passed unemploy-
ment insurance and work-
men’s compensation, bills for-
merly passed at the regular
session. The bills had been

vetoed by Democratic Gover-
nor Harriman because of crip-

pling amendments opposed by
labor. _
9 Scioli and Local 593 com-
mitteemen, who lobbied at
the session together with’
delegates from AFL-CIO
unions, said they expected
the Governor would again
veto the bills because of
such “booby trap” riders as
penalty taxes on seasonal
industries. The state’s labor
movement, had supported
the original veto despite the
increased » benefits‘ in the
bills, on the basis that exist-
,ing provisions without in-
’ crease would be preferable

to passage of the harmful .

riders.

While in_ Albany for the spe-
cial session‘ the Mine-Mill PAC
members met with Gov. Harri-
man in his executive cham-
bers, and had a friendly dis-
cussion on labor problems.

No Violation

PAC chairman Nathan
Sharpe of Local 758 in Chi-
cago says his ‘local sent a let-
ter of protest on the Howard
and church bombings in Besse-
mer to the Alabama governor
and U. S, Attorney General’s
office- They got an answer
from Ass’t Attorney General
Warren Olney III and Civil

Rights Section Chief St. John .

Barrett.

Concerning the “alleged, ex-
plosion of bombs,“ the answer
said: _“Information in our pos-
session indicates that no vio-
lation of a federal statute is
involved‘ in this matter.” “ It

said that the Justice depart-

ment, therefore, ‘had no au-
thority‘ to undertake action
for the prosecution of those
responsible for the bombings.

Brass Crisis

Plans for a meeting of Con-
necticut Mine-Mill brass local
delegates with their U.S. con-
gressmen and senators to dis-
cuss present industry ‘prob-
lems have been proposed by
District 6 Board member Irv-
ing Dichter and Int’l Rep.
Henry Rapuano, chairman of
the Conn. Mine-Mill Legisla-
tive committee.‘ ,

A letter from Rapuano to
Connecticut Cong. James T.
Patterson pointed up the cur-

rent crisis in the brass indus-
try and urged a meeting of the
state’s congressional delega-
tion with brass workers’ rep-
resentatives either in Wash-
ington or Connecticut. The let-

teri also pointed out that the
recent meeting of Mine-Mill’s
Int’l Executive Board had en-
dorsed the aims, with some

qualifications, of Patterson’s

import quota bill.

Similar meetings on: brass
problems have been held
successfully in the past by
the Mine-Mill Connecticut_
brass locals with their con-
gressmen and senators.

first union contract, but it was worthit. What they've won is one of the best in the mining
industry. The iob now is to make it work, nnd.that’s'wha_t the-local 937 stewards are studying
to do. Photo shows a- portion of the day shift stewards at one of the shift meetings held to school

PENSION PLAN
0 A new pension plan, com-

bining features of the Mine-

great improvement over the .
-old Magma-San AManuel plan.

1 O A general seniority clause
covering promotions‘ and fill-
ing of vacancies also estab-

-lishes the principle of senior-

ity for the first time at San
Manuel, eliminating past prac-

'tices of favoritism and dis-

crimination, and guaranteeing

promotions strictly according
-to seniority and qualifications.
e Also for the first time at.
San Manuel, the contract pro-

vides full recognition" ‘of the

union stewards and grievance

committee, establishing griev-
ance and arbitration pro-

. cedures as standard protection

against unjust discipline or
discharge,_ etc. The grievance
and arbitration procedure also

In most‘ states, arbitration
agreements are not enforce-
able under existing state laws
with the result that if an em-
ployer refused to arbitrate

Workers Must Not Bear Brunt of Ills

Assailing the Worlds Metal Markets

LAYOFFS and production cut-backs are again
plaguing the non-ferrous metals industry. This
is the third serious attack of “depression fever”
that has shaken this in-  ‘ 
dustry since the end of
World War II. There have
been recoveries after each
previous attack, but there
have also been serious cas-
ualties in the form of up.-
rooted homes, abandoned
mines, and destroyed com-
munities. , C
Lead-zinc mining in the
U. S. has been on'an al-
most continuous slide for v ’

 
   

was 15 per cent below, average production of
the 1946-50 period; production of lead was down
11 per cent. In this same period, countries out-
side of the U. S. increased their output. of zinc
by 85 per cent, and of leadby 76 per cent.
Just 10 years ago, nearly 23,000 _workers
made’ theirliving in" this sectionof the. indus-
try. Today, it is doubtful if little more than
half that number are on the payrolls and for
most of these, their future is anything but

secure. .
* ‘A’ *

SUCCESSIVE drops in the price of copper,
now down to the early 1953 level of 291/1, cents
——point up basic weaknesses -in that metal. U. S.

, producers have sought to break sliding prices

by cutting back mine production; produc‘tior_1,
so far, has been_ cut’ by about 6,800 tons‘ a
month. Outside of the U. S., production'curtail-
ments—all in Africa——come to about 2,100 tons
a month. ‘ ‘ . -
Unlike the situation in the lead-zinc mining,

- U. S. copper mine production has been expand-

ing in the past seven years, although not as
much as foreign production. Within» the next
four years, an additional 600,000 tons of copper
per year will be coming into world markets
from new mines in Peru, Chile, Canada, and
Africa. ._

The entire non-ferrous- metals industry is
suffering from a failure -to develop new mar-
kets while substitute materials and foreign ‘im-
ports have been taking over oldmarkets.

All of the above is the bare outline of the
situation ‘that was intensively reviewed by
Mine-Mill’s Executive board during its early
June meeting in Denver. The heart of the prob-

Secretary-Treasurer Pezzofi ,

. to countries with the greatest potential for

lem, our analysis showed, lay in the growing
imbalance between increasing supplies of
metals and lagging demand for their use. In-
dustrial use of non-ferrous metals, even in re-
cent periods of boom production, has not grown
appreciably. The basic solution to this problem,
we agreed, is a long range program of develop-
ingynew uses and applications for non-ferrous
metals and expanded world trade——particularly

economic development.

We also had, we felt, a basic obligation to
our own members whosejobs are being wiped
out by a real flood of foreign imports. They
should not continue to bear the main brunt of
the world-wide ills of the industry. Many U. S.
companies, we know, would prefer shutting
down their U. S. properties and keep operating
their lower cost foreign mines.

' ﬁr * *-

IMMEDIATELY, we be1ieve,.some emergency
treatment is necessary for the lead-zinc indus-
try which is being smothered by foreign compe-
tition. “Long-range” remedies, even when
sound, take time to work. And with zinc, for
example, now pouring into the country at an
annual rate of over 800,000 tons—over 80 per
cent of the amount used by industry last year
——we felt that something drastic had to be done.

The need for quick and effective action to
stem the tide ofimports explains our support
for the basic principles of the Metcalf-Murray-
Mansfield bill,- which would impose import
taxes wheneverthe domestic market prices of

lead and zinc fall below certain specified peril‘

points. Similar action will be called for by us

if the copper situationcontinues to deteriorate.
.- We also recognized another problem
that is not now dealt ‘with in the Metcalf
bill—namely, that some imports will always
be necessary to supply the needs of Ameri-
can industry. The total amount of imports
needed in any one year could easily be de-
termined on the basis of estimated needs.

* Within that total, we felt, preference should
be given to countries which l1ave,‘in.'recent
years, been our main-sources of supply and
also, to countries with wage rates most _
nearly comparable to our own. Recognition ‘
of these principles would, we felt, preserve

_ for countries like Canada their fair share
of t.he_U.-S. market.’ '

We’re now attempting to have introduced,
in this session of Congress, a new bill embody-
ing these principles. _ ‘

Supreme CourtSays Uncle Sam
is Symbol of Land ofthe Free. 

IT IS now pretty well recognized that the Su-
preme court of the Unitedsstates, going to bat
for John Citizen, has dealt a crippling blow———
if not a death blow—+to the witch -hunt.

After some ten years of affliction with Me-
Carthyism and assorted political . ailments
Uncle Sam has been pretty   --
rnuch restored to his old
self, the symbol of the
land of the free. The
thanks of the citizenry‘ are
-due to Chief Justice War-
ren and his associates.

‘Instead of getting these
t h a nk s for preserving
traditional American free-
doms, the Justices are now
the target of crackpots
and reactionaires who
want to do everything from i
lynching them. '

It is mighty peculiar A" that some of the
loudest. voices raised against the court are
the -same ones which twenty years ago

bellowed about ' the “sanctity” of the Su-
preme court when Franklin D. Roosevelt
tried to modernize it. At that time,. the
\ court was knocking off New Deal legisla-
tion as fast as Congress produced it, and
these same reactionaries were hailing the
court as the bulwark of freedom. Ob-
viously, it depends on whose freedom is
at stake, the corporations’ or - the indi-

vidual’s.

court and its defense of Constitutional

The labor press also has recognized the real

on the J encks and other cases. Typical of labor

, comments is. the following -from the =COLO-

“. .  The ruling is not a victory for the
Communists. It is‘ a‘ victo'ry'~_fo_r Americans.
For those Americans, at’ any rate, who be-
lieve that’ this is a free country, that it is
disastrous to try to regulate what a man be-
lieves (as some Communist states, appear to
v be slowly ‘finding out), and’ that free discus-
sion, and debate is both the spice of life and‘
v the surest way to the truth.”

*1: 1*

TORGANIZED labor has’ always championed

the basic freedoms of thought, speech and as-.
sembly, because these are essential to the right
to organize and bargain collectively. These
Supreme Court decisions are therefore more
important to labor, which makes up the bulk
of the ordinary citizens, than for corporation
heads. and other more favored segments‘ of the
population. ,

For this reason, it strikes me as pretty pe-
culiar that, the Supreme Court has had _to re-
mind the leaders bf the great American labor
movement that the fundamental freedoms guar-
anteed by the Constitution are still in effect.
These same leaders have. been entirely too
readyvto wipe ut these freedoms in their own

Igargest District 5
rence   Held

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

CHARLESTON, S. C.-—The largest and most rep-

 iresentative conference ever held in" District 5 was held
i...‘ here June 15 and 16 with more than 60 delegates from
 12 Mine-Mill locals in the Deep South attending.

':The conference was held in the new union head-

i"':' ouarters of Local 863. It

was addressed. by Vice-
‘President Asbury Howard and
A lb e r t
Pezzati, who dedicated the new

' hall. ”
Social highlight of the two-

day meeting was an old fash-

ioned southern barbecue held

 in old fashioned southern hot
 Weather. ‘

~ Progress on contracts, sen-
.- iority, health and welfare, and
other matters were reported
by the delegates in a discus‘-
, sion which had the following
" highlights:

  . The fertilizer and phos-

'phate industry is in serious
condition due to the problems
of the farmers "and especially
the soil/-bank. Shipping season
.in some plants represented by
Mine-Mill locals had been cut
seriously; layoffs were gener-

" al; and three phosphate mines

were completely shut down in
Middle Tenn. A special con-
ference of, the Fertilizer-Phos-
phate_Counci1 will be -called la-

" ter in the year to consider the

serious problems confronting
our members and workers
generally - in this industry.

- I" 2. Half of the locals in Dis-

trict 5‘have set up health and
welfare committees in line
with‘ the program set forth at
the recent International Con-
vention. In ‘several locals, not-
ably 531 in Bessemer, these
committees have already de-

Velopeda great deal of useful _

activity, details of which'were
reported to the Conference.

 3. In_ spite of the tension_
throughout the south ‘I on the

issue of integration, several

‘Negro members and also the

- Co‘peni'ng up of new job oppor-

.tunit_iesi- for - Negro workers
where discrimination had‘ been
the custom in the past.

 4.i'A number of locals have

‘active steward, councils and
educational work and. classes
. are held periodically in 'a large
number of locals by both‘ dis-
'trict 5 staff and local officers.

 L  From all delegates there

was an outpouring of expres-

sions of, pride in Mine-Mill

and its record of achievement
_ and principles ‘in the South.

truth it_was “higher than the

Labor History . . . Strike Unity . . . Scab Beer
Nobody Wants Steel '

An editorial in the June 5 issue of “Hard
Rock News,” national organ of the AFL-CIO
Non-Ferrous Metals council, blasts the Execu-
tive council of the AFL-CIO for ignoring the
request for a charter. in the non-ferrous metals
industry and places the blame on David J. Mc-
Donald's "Steelworkers union. McDonald, the
editorial says, claims jurisdiction in this in-_
dustry “where he has no representation and
where the workmen prefer no union to what he
tries to sell them.” The editorial then points
out how Steel has_ consistently lost in raids on
Mine-Mill. _

“Since June 27, 1950,” the AFL-CIO Hard
Rock News says, “the Steel union has tried 26
times in the western part of the Non,-Ferrous
industry to defeat the Mine-Mill union in NLRB
elections. . . . Mine-Mill has won 21,500 dues
paying members and the steel union has won
1,858 dues paying members in N on-Ferrous, not
counting elections in Canada and in fabrication

‘in this country. . . . How. long can President
Meany and the (AFL-CIO) ‘Council afford to
let Steel claim jurisdiction at this rate?”

REVIEW

0 It was June and it came busting out all over the witch-
hunters. The East German Communists started a campaign

 

»_ » .- to tear down pinup pictures of Marilyn Monroe . . . The
 ’- strangest people were advocating trade with China . . . The ‘
5 H-Bomb exploded onto the front pages through the good of-
fices, of 2,000 U. S. scientists who urged an end to test explo-
~ . sions . . . The Yankees and the White Sox were slugging it
' out . . . But it was the ‘august Supreme Court of the United
States which topped the news in June:

The Return to Sanity in the Law

 IN A series of far-reaching decisions, the Supreme Court last
  month charted America’s return to the Bill of Rights and Con-
_.stit'utional law. In ruling after ruling, the court majority re-
Stored the great principles of democracy on which the nation
was founded. ' .
In essence, the court ruled that you can’.t go around deny-‘
ing folks their Constitutional rights just because you don’t like
A--them. You must give every defendant a fair trial. You must
' «assume that a man is innocent until he’s .proven guilty. You
 can’t deny him the protection of thelaw, no matter what. In
" C [ no case did the court indicate that any American must or should
have any sympathy with Communism or the Communists. It
a just stated simply that democracy is democracy and you can’t
  Y preserve it by watering it down. ‘
 A ' This is the United States of America,»as Tom Paine named
‘ it, and every, citizen has equal rights under the law. It’s the
world’s first democracy. That's what the Supreme Court meant
and that’s why it put its dignified foot down and said “Stop!”

‘ of course, in the name of “Americanism.”

was adopted at the union’s recent convention.

The union that has the 30-hour week with-
out loss in pay is made up of clerical em-
ployees at the Fisher United Auto Workers
Local 581 in Flint, Michigan. They got it in
a recent contract. A similar 30-hour week, was
also‘ won recently by Office Workers‘ Local 42,
for employees ‘of Ford UAW Local 600.

 Mine Peril

Must Stop,

  Board Says

, those who contracted silicosis"

DENVER——Immediate en-
actment of a minimum pro-
gramto cut down industrial
disease and “an abnormally’
high accident rate” continuing
to take “a heavy toll of lives

"in the U. S. metal mining in-

dustry” was urged upon Con-
gress last month by the Execu-

tive Board of the International ‘

Union of Mine, Mill and Smel-
ter Workers.

The union's program which
the board called to Congress’

v attention includes:

l . Appropriations -for -health
and w o rk i n g environment
studies by the Bureau of Mines
and ‘ Public Health service in
mines and smelters.

2. Federal aid to workers suf-
fering from silicosis, miners’
dread -lung disease. This aid
would include direct aid to

in one state and nowﬁwork in

another, and in additionwould.

provide grants-in-aid to states

to_ improve benefits for _sili-0

cotics.

.3. Federal inspection of metal

-duct, and coordinate basic and

-*1
f

mines, mills, smelters and re-
ﬁneries.

'4-.‘A National Occupational

Health center to promote, con-

applied research on all indus-
trial diseases. - ‘

The Mine-Mill officials de-
clared‘ that _‘‘the emphasis
on greater mechanization
and speed of production in
recent years”. has intensified '
the disease‘ and accident‘

/problem, and that ‘.‘wider

« use of block-‘caving, faster

drilling, -automatic conveyor
belts and quicker handling
of -ores and materials have
created more dust (the cause
. of silicosis) in mining" opera-
tions and brought. new haz-
ards to the industry.” a
An additional factor . that
needs considerable emphasis,
the board said, is that failure

‘to sharply reduce. working
hazards will limit “our ability’

to recruit the necessary man-
power , to _ produce essential
metals. . . . Unless conditions
inuour mines are improved,
we -. will be accumulating a
deficit‘ of trained manpower
that could seriously jeopardize
our ability to_ ‘produce
necessary metals.”

Union Leaders
Urge FighHo   
Protect Labor

DENVER——Limitation of the effective use
of —labor’s economic and political strength is
the principal target of “big business and its
political friends” in the current Senate racket
investigations, declared the Mine-l\/fill Executive
Board‘ meeting last {month in Denver.

The board called “unfortunate” the fact that

 

“the Dave Beck scandals have created so much . ~
disorder in the house of labor” and sharply.

criticized the “almost frantic attempts on the
part of some union leaders to meet new attacks

V‘ with professions of purity instead of present-

ing a solid front and insisting upon the pres-
ervation of labor’s rights.”
OUTSIDERS

The Mine-Mill leaders said that “instead
of expanding the rights and privileges of
their memberships, some unions have met
the attacks by surrending even more rank-
and-file rights to non-unionists: so-called
watchdog committees, . public relations
firms, lawyers, and others. Some unions
have issued brassy announcements of
newly-adopted codes of ‘ethics, most of
which are pale imitations of the kind of
rank-and-file control and union democracy
which has marked the 64-year history of »
the International Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers.” ‘

“Anti-labor legislation,” said the board, will ‘-

not correct racketeering, union dictatorship,

andtreasury plundering, but these evils’ “can-
~ only be eliminated by democratic constitution_s,~,

free and open discussionof ,,union business, the
secret-ballot election of officers, and democratic
policy-making. We are proud that these ele-

ments of clean unionism are __woven .into'_ the 1

fabric of the, daily lifeof our union.”
UNFAIR ' . .
The union charged that Senator McClellan
himself has ‘already “exposed his deep hatred
of unionsand -what they stand for. To expect
such a man to conduct; a fair and impartial in-
vestigation is to.ignore the fact that the sen-
ator’s position‘ is identical with ’ that of the
National Association , of Manufacturers, the

ployer organizations."

  Board Asks
Inquiry on
Living Costs

DENVER —Mine-Mill’s In- _

ternational Executive board
urged last’ month that Con-
gress initiate a full-dress hear-
ing into the mounting cost of
living and the relationship be-
tween prices, wages, and
profits. The board's statement
declared: ‘
—“We subscribe wholeheart-
edly to the sentiment ex-
, pressed last month in the offi-
cial organ of the United Mine
Workers that,
widely-publicized. theories of
“profitless p r o s p e r i ty," the
“real reason for the-so-called
inflation is not too much pur-
chasing -power but monopo-
listic price increases growing
out’ of a desire for more
profits.” '
. ' FOOD UP
_ “The government reported
«on May 1 24 that living costs-
rose to another record level in
April—for the eighth consecu-
tive month. The major factor
was "a sharp increase in the
costs: of food. In addition,
prices‘ of most other major.
groups of ‘consumer; goods
and services also rose.
“Aslmion leaders, charged
with the responsibility of

standards of our member-
ship, we repeat our demand
for a full investigation of
prices and other factors
leading to higher living
costs. Labor must not let
go unchallenged the‘ false‘
economic theories . emanat-
ing from corporation pub-
licity officers which smugly
bemoan “high wages” as the
cause: of . the rising cost of
. living. We subscribe to the
‘statement of Leon Keyser-
ling, [former chairman of
the President’s Economic
Advisers under President
Truman, that this theory is
pure -propaganda and that
the truth is that “wages
. have not- been keeping up
with the growth of produc-
tivity.”
“Labor’s demand for a price

siderable support from econo-
mistsof national repute. Only
recently Prof. John Kenneth
Galbraith of Harvard Univer-
sity, endorsed the proposal for
public hearings on price in-
creases. - ,
_ ‘ BILLIONS _ -
“There are now a record 81
{corporations with assets of
one billion dollars or more.
This "new, economic fact, we
believe, more_ nearly goes to-
_the heart of inflation and
profiteering than annual wage
increases of a few cents per
hour’ ,
“The people need to know
why_. the Billion Dollar Club
is; growing_ in the corporate '
world, while in the world of
the lworkingj man and his
family, his so-called higher ’
‘wages buy less and less .
each succeeding month.
_“Only a full’-dress investiga-
tion by Congress of the eco-
nomic life ' of the nation will

truth to the country. Growing
living costs require such ‘a
probe be started immediately
and with all necessary speed.
to prevent a critical loss of
income tothe nation’s wage
earners and farmers.” ’ ‘

Board on Brass Crisis

DENVER——An industry-government program to 

develop new uses for copper products as one means of-
solving the brass industry crisis was called for by the
Mine-Mill International Executive board at its recent
meeting here. Full cooperation of the union with any
such program was pledged.

NEW USES NEEDED
The Board statement pointed out that failure.
of the industry to develop new and more extended
uses of copper products was a major cause of the
present crisis in brass where both production -andf. A
employment are down. The use of copper products
has gone up only 6 percent in the past seven years '
as compared with a 28 percent rise in industrial
production as a whole, the Board said. This con-; 
trasts with the use of aluminum which has
doubled during the same period. ‘ ' -

At the same time, the Mine-Mill leaders ‘called if ._
attention to ‘*‘a sizeable increase in the import of brass.‘ I
products” which has seriously endangered the jobs-of 

certain brass workers-
a large percentage of U. S. brass production, represent

“These imports, though not

nearly 90 percent of total small tube consumption in  c

this ’country,”' the Board said. -_
I PATTERSON BILL

As a means of ‘placing, some limitation on . .- H

I — T these imports, the Board expressed support of the i ‘V’
basic aim of a bill introduced by Connecticut Con-  ’
gressman James Patterson. The bill would estab-

‘ lish quotas on brass imports limiting them to the
- average of the past five years. , ~ ‘

“We should like to see this quota system. com-if

TORONTO ‘— The issue in-

volved in our campaign .to

organize all uranium workers.

in the Blind River district is

"more clear now than at any

previous time and the union’s
cfrogitam takes positive shape

around this issue. Beginning,
* in 1954, Rio Tinto at its Pronto

Mine opened the first attack
against honest effective trade
unionism and used as its main

agent the old discredited Ca- .

nadian -Mine Workers Union
(NCCL).- ' 7

this district and were fast" suc-

, ceeding, the companies in des-
peration to maintain low

wages and substandard work-_

, ing and living clonditions,‘
' dumped the CMW/A, U and en-
' tered into a voluntary three-

ffléar contract deal with of-
ficials of the Steelworkers’ Un-'
ion’ ‘(July 16, 1956).

STEEL UNION

This Company-Steel ‘action ’
did for a time serve the intent F

and ‘V purpose of blocking‘ the‘

desire and demand of ‘Pronto-' M
Algom workers to be repre--’

sented in bargaining through
their ‘Mine Mill & Smelter
Workers’ Union. The ‘three-

year -Company-Steel deal also "
undercut and b e t r a y e d “the”

men's rights to decent wages V
and conditions. While the -

workers suffered these condi-

tions, company profits ..were-.

growing into millions of dol-

lars. No wonder these‘ com-_

panies fear the advance of
Mine Mill.

They tremble as our Union
Ksombards the issue of the col-
lusive three-year deal saddling
their employees. They suffer
a chill when they think of fac-
ing Mine Mill above ‘the bar-
gaining table, knowing thata
part of their profit millions

V will have to be shared to pro-
> vide decent wages’, hours, job
' safety, housing conditions (no '

double-deckers), s hif t pre-

miums, Sunday ‘pay, holidays, ,

So the issue i_s clear. It is

where our Union ‘is currently
bargaining. Here, this multi-

 Look just brieﬂy at the re-

cent vote campaign at North‘-
span Mines (Rio Tinto owned).
There we witnessedthe fiasco
of company interference in
favour of the Steel; officials.

Again the company’s despera-

tion_to hold on to this cheap
three-year Algom-Pronto deal
was in shameless evidence.
With all the -collusion,’ how-
ever, they failed as the vote
resulted in a -stalemate: with
neither Mine Mill or Steel get-
ting the necessary-51 percent.
On May 21, and May,3l.
we made application for cer-
;tification to the Canada
' Labour Relations Board on,

employees respectively.

May 17 when trophies and

During the past year, from
.October to May, classes were
held for boys and girls in the
union hall every ‘Thursday eve-

girls are welcome to join. Un-
der the direction of Mrs. Helen

With the-—Denison .men
united in their ‘position and
followed through by the
united position of- the Pronto
and Algom. men,‘ there is no

doubtthat the -issue of the

undercutting” three-year deal
will be overcome and replaced

by contracts’ bargained

through Mine Mill", ~ -
This too is the united posi-
tion of N orthspan Workers and
in fact every uranium worker
‘ in this billion-dollar area. Mine
Mill is predominant in the

- mining. industry across Can-

ada including the uranium sec-
tions; We" hold all contracts

and we are the only certified

union in_ the Blind River ura- '

'niu'm area. Our‘ certification

at Denison Mines means that ,
Mine Mill represents -the Work- _

ers at the largest Blind River
area operation.

‘Our Union's, program em-

braces the positive outloo“k of

exclusive bargaining rights in
each‘ of the three Canadian
uraniumymining areas and it
was with this outlook in mind
that our last annual conven-

BOARD STATEMENT

5 The Jencks decision came

‘ while the Mine-Mill Executive

, 0 board was in session in Den-
 ‘ M,-,,:i7er. Asked for its reaction by
’ "reporters, the board issued a
statement which said in part:
“The historic decision of the
Supreme Court of the United
States setting aside the con-

, viction of and ordering a new
(‘trial for Clinton Jencks is a
” profoundly important victory
for Jencks as an individual
and for the’ entire member-
ship of this union. Jencks was

I unfairly convicted. This .union
0- was unfairly attacked. The
Supreme Court has vindicated
us in a decision which adds
another stone to the great
structure of American "justice.
The decision deepens our faith

in the Bill of Rights as the’

greatest guarantee of individ-
‘ual. freedom in all the world.
Thus, this decision is signifi-
‘cant for the whole country.
_ “For the second time in a
' few months, this union has
been honored with the op-
“ portunity to successfully de-
T fend basic ,American prin-
. M .3-gwciples in the Supreme Court.
" In the previous case, last
.; December, the Supreme
 Court unanimously affirmed
5, _our ’ bargaining rights under
 -the Taft-Hartley law. Now,
 in the Jencks case, the_ Su-
_-_ preme Court has said that
._ we are entitled to the truth,
:and nothing but the truth

from people who have taken 1

the witness stand ‘against
us. That is all we have ever
asked for.,

“It now becomes possible
for us to show that witnesses
who have made it a profession
in recent years to _testify.
against this union and lts per-
sonnel are‘ liars and perjurers.
It is time now that justice is
meted out to those who have
lied about us under oath.

“Our defense in these mat-

T ters has been costly to us,
both financially and in other
terms. But these sacrifices
are worth while if our vindi-
cationhelps to reaffirm
b a s i c American principles
and the freedom of our un-
ion to pursue its only aim-
to improve the well-being of
our members and their fam-
ilies. ’ V _

“Three of America’s great
independent newspapers, the
NEW YORK TIMES, the
DENVER POST, and the
WASHINGTON POST AND
TIMES-HERALD were quick
to express approval of the
Supreme Court decision. We
believe their response is typi-
cal of the basic American re-
spect for constitutional rights
and fair play, and that this
will prevent the passage of
legislation designed to protect
the anti-union informers and
other professional witnesses.”

Jencks himself‘ Wrote the
union from his home in'Al-
bany, Calif., declaring there
are “no adequate means to ex-
press my and my family’s ap-
preciation” for the union‘s le-
gal fight. “All of us in this
home,” he said, “are tremen-
dously happy over the rever-
's_al and victory . . . thank you
for your help, your friendship

- . . . Thank you for providing‘

this case with the finest at-
torneys to be found anywhere,
John McTernan and Nathan
Witt.” ,

The Executive Board offi-
cially expressed the union's
gratitude to General Counsel
Witt and other attorneys con-
nected with the case.

The Minerals SP rog ra

(Continued from Page 1)
of the Senate to reprint Mine-
Mill’s minerals program in the
appendix_ of the Congressional
Record, the report of Con-
gress’ daily proceedings.

' THE PROGRAM

Mine-Mill’s Executive Board,
at its early’ June meeting in
Denver, adopted a rounded
minerals program to meet the
growing crisis in the non-fer-
rous metals industry. The
board’s program, embodying
both immediate and long
range proposals, calls for:

I; Support for a sliding im-
port tax on Vleadi and zinc
whenever: the U.S. prices of
those metals fall below speci-
fied peril points, as provided
in the current Metcalf Bill-
HR A 7844—to'gether with a
flexible quota system that
would base quotas, for any
country; on both the past rec-
ord of imports and the com-
parative wage level.

2. The undertaking of a great-
ly expanded r e s e a r c h pro-
gram, by both, the Federal
government and industry, for
the development of new uses
for copper, lead,.and zinc.

.The re-examination- of the
avenues of world trade as pro-
posed by Senators Lyndon
Johnson (D.. 'Te‘x.), Warren
Magnusoni (D. Wash.) and
Mike Mansfield (D. Mont.)
‘,‘,New trade,” the board ‘state-

,‘ment‘ said, “if placed upon a

realistic business basis, should
prove to be mutually advan-
tageous to -all'countries and
could conceivably open up
greatly expanded markets for
the products of industry.”
BRASS ‘

In a V separate "statement on
the brass situation (See Page
9), the board supported‘ the

aims of a bill introduced by‘

Rep. James T. Patterson (R.

:

* for “drastic remedies .

Conn.) which would restrict"
imports from any one country
to, average imports of -the past
five years. Here, too,,~the board
urged combining the quota
system with a‘provision that
would give favored status to
countries with the highest
wage rates. Imports, of small
brass tubes, it was noted, have
recently taken over nearly 90
per cent of the US. market.

Mine-Mill’s proposal to limit
imports of‘lead and zinc, the
b 0 ar (1 statement said, was
based on the immediate need
. to
prevent what could develop
into a collapse of an essential
U. S. industry.”

“In the present immediate
.situation,” the board de-
clared, “the industry re-
quires and must have some
real promise of price stabil-
ity. That, ’we are now con-
vinced, can only be achieved
through‘ some limitations of

, imports that are now flood-

ing our markets.”

The statement also noted‘

“Few of the remaining lead-
zinc mines still in operation
can long survive unless the.
present downward trend of
prices is sharply checked and

-reversed. No single United"

States lead-zinc property can
continue at its present level
of operation under prevailing
price trends.”

A similar brake on imports
of copper, it was made clear,
would also be called for if that
situation continues to deterio-
rate. .

NOT ‘ENOUGH

The Board also recognized
that merely, limiting imports
is not an ultimate solution to
the problems of this industry.
“Unless some of the more
basic problems are frankly
considered and dealt with, this
type of hypodermic treatment,

in

»

although presently necessary,‘ ‘
could create new _. Vdifficultiesf;
