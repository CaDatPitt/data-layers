VOICE OF THE PEOPLE

Bronx: Congratulations to the
white parents of Malverne, L. I.
As the father of four children, I
would ﬁght the transfer of my
children from their "neighborhood
schools. I believe We should all
unite and stop this utopianldrcﬁim.

Manhattan: How ironic! Negro
leaders are constantly "preaching

about the “moral” issue of segre-
gation. Now come those two
paragons of virtue, Anthony
Quinn and Marlon Brando, to
lend their well-publicized “moral”
support. Well, I guess it’s easier
than ﬁghting paternity suits.
a Mrs. W. RYAN.

Bridgeport, Conn.: Negroes
carry slogans demanding all
sorts of things. How about the
American public saying: “We de-
mand less crime”? Negroes de-
mand equal rights; how about
equal responsibilities? H. S.

Manhattan: The majority of
people are for laws that give
equal job and educational oppor-
tunity to all, regardlessvof color.
The majority are also opposed to
laws that will force them to live
with other people, regardless of
color. N.Y. CITIZEN.

Brooklyn: Charlayne Hunter,
‘the Negro girl who was admitted
to the University of Georgia in

1961,‘ certainly did not waste any
time in annexing a white student
for a husband, one Walter. Sto-
vall. They now are living in
"wedded bliss in Greenwich Vil-
lage and are expecting a. baby.
Is this the new type of integra-
tion the American people can
7expect, colored girls giving birth
to white babies and white girls
‘ giving birth to.,black children? .
UNHAPPY _MISS.
Queens: Just how do the tactics

got’ the Negroes forcing themselves

on employers differ from those of
gangsters forcing business people
to give them a payoff?

Mrs. A. L.

CORE will really get down to
serious business and overcome

segregation existing among the

"A   Man’s Heaven “White

 

OCTOBER II, 1963

By Andrew G. Paschal

ln'1920, Dr. William Ed-

\-.':|rd Burghardt DuBois pub-l I

lished his DARKWATEIL,
The chapter on “The Dam-‘
nation of Women" was :1:

white south for the degrada-

blisterlng indictment of the} H
l

tion of Negro womanhood.
doubt that Charlayne has‘
read this or that she knows
much about DuBois.

When he was on a boat"

journeying to Germany to]

complete his education, a] 7"

young white woman asked-
him to marry her. DuBois
frankly told her that he had
some work to finish. and that
he had not planned to marry
any woman who was not of
African descent. Now the
question is: DuBois or Char-
iayne?

ll-‘ DUBOIS had elected to
marry this white woman,
she was European and per-
haps she and her family had
no misgivings about race
and color. But Charlayne
elected to marry into a
southern white family, which
no doubt had been responsi-
ble for lynching and raping
of the manhood and woman-
hood of her race. ‘

Now, she states that she is
happy over what she has
done, but her happiness may
have come all too soon. Even
now signs indicate it will
have a short life. Suppose
her baby should take the
worst characteristic of the
white grandfather. Then the
grown-up baby may one day
lynch or rape the mother!

What she married claims
to be an integrationist. All
white men are “integration-
ist" when it comes to having
sex relation with women like
her. The four white men
from the South who were
caught in a Chicago hotel
having indecent sex relations
with a 14-year-old Negro girl
were such integrationists.

Take a look back at the
slave ‘holders, (Southern
gentlemen), they were the
first “great integrationists"
in this respect. '

FOR THIS long standing
base and vile reason, white
"men" only object. to the Ne-
gro woman in anticipation of
the Negro man. Suppose the
young Negro man who en-
tered the University wit
Chariayne had up and mar-
ried a white student? Would
the reaction have been the
same?

Would this have contribut-
ed to “educational integra-
tion in the South"? Did Char-

he would object to her com-
panion marrying a white
girl? Perhaps not.

She was too much “hon-
ored" to do the integration-
ist cause a small sex favo_r.
In fact, she was a weakllng.
She was a coward in the sit-
uation. There is no telling
just how much may have
happened to her discredit be-
fore she got “married" to
this hillbilly.

IN CHICAGO there are
several large firms known to
hire only white women, white
men and Negro women. No
Negro men are hired. What
are they thinking? What are
they trying to do? I predict
that if this integration trend
continues, Negro women will
be integrated into southern
white institutions to be con-
cubines, and prostitutes for
the white males while the
white “lady" students look
on with scorn and a burning
passion just as it was in the
days of chattel slavery.

Why not let integration
rest? Just what are we try-
ing to integrate? The heirs
of the lynchers and rapists
with the heirs of the lynched
and raped? Would not a mo-
ment of sterilizing repent-
ance be better than rushing
off to the bedroom? The
world knows by now that a
white man may marry a Ne-
gro woman if he can't other-
wise use her, but he is for-
ever “protecting” w h i t e

Several days ago, Dr. Wil-
liam Edward Burghardt Du-
Bois died in Africa and was
buried by Ghana with state
rites. In 1920, in his DARK.

Eliiult Muhammad Cuutionsl
On Use of Non-Violence

PHILADELPHIA, Pa. —

ble because it plays right into the white man’s “trigger
fingers,” Elijah Muhammad, Muslim leader told an audience
of 10,000 followers and visitors at the Arena here Sunday

afternoon.

Speaking specifically on non-
violence Mr. Muhammad said,
“We have tried to live in peace
in the face of all things . . .
beatings, lynchings, killings,
frame-ups, bombings, even the
invasion of Mosque No. as in
Los Angeles in'April, 1962, re-
sulting in the death of one Mus-
lim and the shooting of seven
others.

“But it happens no more with-
out striking back,” the spiritual
leader of black Muslims in North
America declared.

“Christians or Muslims, black
men are being killed for trying
to live right. We look for no
more justice. It seems the gov-
ernment has given police and
highway patrols the freedom to
beat and kill any Negro, South or
North. They shoot and kill and

Delegations of Muslims also
motored in from Was , Bos-

Mr. Muhammad called upon all
black leaders to:

o Unite and form a militant

America’: 20 Million black peo-

o Endorse and support the
right of black people to act in

0 Launch a full-scale political

0 Unity of all black leaders to

He said Black
Muslims were not interested in
sitting down beside a white
man at a lunch counter and
eating a hamburger.

"We don't want the ham»

OCT. 5, 1963

There has never been any doubt about my

being a do or die New Yorker; I even read the

New Yorker. But last weekend found me feeling
like a pampered darling, visiting the City for the
first time. The reason was that the Club of clubs,
the Rinkeydinks, took over the new Rockerfeller
Center Hilton Hotel for three days. The order of
the day was Chauffeur-
ed - driven limosines,
penthouse parties and
pink champagne. Next
week promises to ‘ be
even as delightful. My
dear Frank Sinatra sent
me tickets via Robert
Nesbitt for the fabulous
show at Carnegie Hall.
Lena Horn will share
billing with Frank and
I can't wait to see this
charity event for the
Gandi Society for Hum-
an Rights.

Sunday will find me at the Ebony’s “Ameri-
can a Sixty Three,” this again at the Hilton. Six
Negro designers will exhibit their latest creations,
and by the way, if you don’t have your tickets, the
National Urban League will be open Saturday.

But back to Friday, first it was dinner with
host Jimmy Taylor, man-of-fashion from Chicago,
then it was Greenwich Village revisited again
this week; saw a great show and did several
spots. Saturday found me in gold and white at a
very‘ private party given at the Pent-house of the
New Hilton. The Rinkeydinks from New York
gave a party for the visiting chapters. Noble
Sissle’s lovely daughter Cynthia was present.
She is employed by A.B.C. and is very happy with
her work. She is a production Assistant. Dr. Ches-
ter Redhead, who listens to my show daily in
his car, which means he has FM equipment, said
his day is not complete unless he tunes me in.

There havebeen sly comments recently about
spelling, the spelling that is in my column. Dave
Hepburn mentioned it to me at the pent-house
party. I replied that its not how its spelled but
what the message is that counts. He said he en-
joyed the column in spite of spelling. Leaving the

party we ran into a breathless Catherine Basie,

Ludden, NAACP youth field sec-
retary takes delight in recalling
this incident for all who will
listen.

“When Dick Gregory and I
\vere participating in street ‘dem-
onstrations against segregation
in Greenwood. Mississippi’ two
months ago. I was standing next
to Dick when he said to a white
cop who was blocking his path:

"Hello n—r”.

Ludden said the white cop
turned arotmd and looked ,
him to see whom Gregory. was
addressing.

Gﬁeeﬁmy again said to theoop;

“ o n-qr”.

The cop pointed to himself and
asked Gregory:

who was endeavoring to keep up with the hectic
pace of the weekend.

Sunday, before the dance. Robert McCrary
sent for us for cocktails at his home. The car
you know was just an ordinary Rolls Royce. . .
just like the one the folks next door own. Joining
us there were popular Jeffery Mays, Eddie Simp-
son,,Robert Lee and the ever fabulous L’tanya.

Rinkeydink Hildergarde Bostic was in for the
weekend from Los Angeles, and as usual she was
stunning. The break-up of the evening was Dinah
Washington’s comment when Dorothy Donnegan
entered the ballroom dripping to the floor in
chinchilla. Dinah stopped singing; placed her
hands on her hips and said “Now that they've
seen you honey, you can be seated.”

Ran into Molly Metcalfe, excorted as usually,
by handsome Jack Dunn. Molly was leaving the
Plaza as I was entering. Jack Livesay nearly stole
the show at the oak room; he arrived with Gloria
Sayer who was drapped in sable, and at this time
of year. India Inderwich was at the Apollo for the
evening and to borrow a phrase from Louella
Parsons, India never looked lovlier. Well as you
can see, it was quite a weekend. Party after
party, arrival after arrival, Rolls Royces, pent-
houses: wine and roses.

Sandy Lawrence has an exciting new position
with The Brooklyn Carpet Exchange . . . Publish-
er George Le-vitan in from Texas, which is Fort
Worth’s loss . . . Mary Lou Williams now at Well’s
and doing a great job as can be testified by the
large crowds she is drawing . . ; T.J. Walker of
M.M.U. survived a major accident but wrecked
his beautiful new car . . . Josephine Baker at
Carnegie Hall October 12 . . . George Hamilton at
Sardi’s chattered with me about his forthcoming
picture .
first appearance of the season this Friday at
Philharmonic Hall . . . Peter Lind Hayes and
wife Mary Healy replacing Dorothy and Dick on
WOR . . . Brick Stuart at El Morrocco and in
high spirits . . . Willowemoc’s' Pheasant shoot
October 15 weekend. And didn't Randy Faison
pull a fast one with the announcement of his
Metropolitan Opera Debut, now really, we’ll have
to all get a box at the opera. .

And that's the Sharper side of New York,
for this week.

"Who are you calling a n-.—ar,
boy, me?’

Grinning all the while, Gregory
looked him dead in the eye'an'd
said:

‘Yes, I'm talking to yoo,.

. Aren't you a n..-r'. .

‘Hell no. I'm no n-r’.

’l‘hen Gregory said to him:

“Well, you go up to Chicago
andlookatmyhomeandthen
come back here to Greenwood,
Mississippi and tube a look.-at
your house then you'll ‘how
you’re nothing but a n-._.r”.

Ludden said, the cop glaedmt
Gregory, rolled his tdoodshot
eyes from lack of sleep and
walked away swinging his stick.

Gregory confirmed the above

Nhrumah is Ghana. When our history is recorded the man
Kwame Nkrumah will be written as The Liberator, The
Messiah, The Christ of our day, whose great love for
mankind wrought changes in Ghana, in Africa and in the‘

The jails of Ghana are beginning to bulge with "detainees"
officially known as "gangsters." Once inside, the victims
get no immediate trial. Fear of the informer stalks the
land and creates an ominous silence whenever politics are
mentioned.i Groups which formerly debated politics with
enormous gusto dissolve into silence. No one is finally
certain that his neighbors will not report on him; the
only safety is a dismal quiet. . . .

JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa-—South Africa's segre-
gatlonist government has
jailed nearly a million Afri-
cans in two years of perse-
cution under “inﬂux-control”

and “pass” regulations.
These regulations were
passed by the white ruling
minority in an effort to con-

trdl the movements or non-

whites for the purpose oi’
rigid segregation and make

snake venom.

In S. Africa

it easier for government se-
cret police to deal with the
growing nationalism.

Since the Sharpeville mas.-
sacre oi’ March 21, 1960,
when government troops and
police fired upon unarmed
Africans protesting the de-
testable “pass regulations,”
there has been a crackdown
on Africans who want free-
dom tor the black majority.

Very serious matter

All motorists and cyclists in Nyasaland must
now stop when the car of Dr. Banda, the
Prime Minister, appears, according to the
Malawi Congress Party newspaper Malawi
News. Any plea that they did not know the
car was approaching or did not know his
car would not be an excuse.

“Those who do not stop and give way will
be insulting our Prime Minister and -will
incur the wrath of the people. . . . We do
not want to do unpleasant things to any-
body. We hope, therefore, that everyone in
the country will co-operate in this very seri-
ous matter." — The Guardian, March 2.

Twisting Minnie

The first thing in the morning,
she begins twisting in bed,

She twisted so hard, up jumped
the dead.

In the shower she twists by 7

the hour, she twists,

Twisting Minnie just couldn’t
resist.

She twisted on butter, moved
milk in the gutter,

She twists her shapely thighs,
Cat, that is a sight for any
sore eyes, A .
You don’t call her Minnie for

nothing,
Because when she does the

Onion, Cat, that’s something. 
And she’s really not bluffing, 
She twists north, east, south - 

and west, .

There’s no doubt about it, she’s
the best.

She twists the shake and mo-
tions like a Cadillac,

Cats and wolves, she’s in the 9

act .

She twists for love, otherwise

joy. .
It’s a beautiful sight for any
hep boy.

She’s a jiving little twister, 
And a wiggling little blister, 
Raised with her jiving sisters. 
Twistin’ Minnie Twists in the 

snow,

She’s just a twisting little so 

and so,
A hep kitty,
bitty.

WHISTLING ON SHABBOS
Question: is it prohibited to
whistle on Shabhu?

Allen sehnall
Brooklyn, NY.
Answer: The Aruch Hashulchan

as the Ramaw in the Shulchan
Aruch Orech Chaim 338:1, the
Mawgane Avraham, etc., permit
whistling or singing with the
mouth on Shabbos. It is only
prohibited to use an instrument
on Shabbos.

BLESS] NG OVER
CHEWING GUM
Question: Is it necessary to recite
a blessing over chewing gum?

Allen Schnall
Brooklyn, NJ.

Answer: The Gemara in Bern-
chose He states: “A mere taste
does not require a blessing and
one who is keeping a fast, may
take a taste and there is no ob-
jection. How much may he taste?
Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi used
to taste as much as a ‘rebith’ (a
fourth of a log or about an egg
and a half)."

Tosfes (ibid) explains this is
applicable only, if he spits it out
and does not swallow it for we
do not have ‘hanaoh', enjoyment
from merely tasting it or keeping
it in our mouth. Therefore, if he
eventually spits it out, he does
not (more) make a blessing,

The Beth Yosef (Tor Orech
chain 210) says that we only
make a blessing over enjoyment
of the stomach and not from
chewing. For the Torah tells us.
“You should eat, be content and
then bleu G-d." Only from the
enjoyment of eating which enters
the stomach may we make a
blessing.

The Chofetz Chaim (ibid)
warns us against making a ‘Beta-
cha L'Vatala', an unnecessary
blessing, therefore if we chew
food to make it soft for a child.
regardless of the amount we
chew, we do not make 3. bless-
ing. This is similar to chewing
tobacco and smoking over which
we do not make any Berachn
(see also the Mawgane Avraham
and the Be’er Hetev, ibid).

A Suggestion

Dear Editor:

I would like to suggest a way
to solve vandalism and how to
avoid broken windows in Tem-
pies and schools is by the use of
plexiglass. This would be ideal
for Yeshlvas and Temples, es-
pecially on the sunny side and
of course a stone will not break
it like in the case of glass.
Then storm windows with
double screens could be put up
during the summer and the same
storm windows could be replaced
with plexiglass (plastic) to pro
tect the stained glass windows.
This I believe is the partial solu-
tion.

Sincerely,

Aryeh

., Last Minute Efforts Opens B’kIyn

Botanical Gardens For Taslilich.

Last year the Brooklyn Botanical Gar-
dens was made “off-limits". to Jews wish-
ing to say Tashlich on Rosh Hashana. How-
ever, the order was recinded through last
minute efforts made __by Rabbi Samuel
Shrage and Borough officials. ,

This year again, trouble began to brew
and only at the last moment was the gate
iipened and permission given to say Tash-

ich.

The following is the statement issued
by Rabbi Samuel Shrage, leader of the
committee who won the right for local
Jews to say Tashlich in the Botanic Gar-
dens:

“For more than two decades, Ortho-
dox Jews have been using the small lake
at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens as the
site for ‘Tashlich.’ These Jews come main-
ly from the Crown Heights East Flatbush
area.

“They realize that the Prospect Park
lake is much larger but it causes them
hardship to walk an additional mile and a
half particularly after they have walked
from as far away as Utics. and Rochester
Avenues. '

“Last year, someone suggested _that
those Jews entering the park through a
turnstile are in violation of religious laws
since every time a person passes through
the machine. an electrical gadget registers
a number thus park authorities can de-
termine the number of people who visit the
gardens and receive a subsidy from the
city on that basis.

“I therefore called upon Dr. George
S. Avery J r., Director of the park to have
thosevturnstiles removed. He refused to
cooperate and on the following day, issued
a statement denying Jews the right to say
Tashlich at the Gardens. He claimed that
it was a matter of religious services con-
ducted in a public park, clearly a. violation
of the Constitution,

“Comptroller Abraham Beame and
Brooklyn B. P. Abe Stark, both ex-officio
members of the Park (as well as the Mayor
and Parks Commissioner Newbold Morris)
did hear me out and agreed with what I
had to say. I maintained that Tashlich is a
custom which is observed on an individual
basis; no rabbi is required to conduct ser-
vices, no cantor is necessary and not even a
mynyan is required. Can Park authorities
prevent me from making a “brocho” in the
park if I wish to drink some water‘! May
I not picnic in the park since as an Ortho-
dox Jew I will wash my hands according to
Jewish law and make ‘Brochos?' Abraham
Beame, Abe Stark and Mayor Wagner
agreed with me and last year Dr. Avery

as overruled and some 12,000 Jews ob-
served Tashlich atthe Gardens. That was
last year.

“Late in August I was informed that
Dr. Avery already had the support of

arks Commissioner Newbold Morris and
had notified Abraham Beame that Jews
could not enter the park for Tashlich. I
was shocked.‘ After all the bad publicity
'he received last year, he now took the
initiative and even before I asked him for
permission to enter -‘the park, he issued his.
decree.

“A Crown Heights resident and a man
who respects Jewish religious obligations,
City Comptroller Abraham Beame, tried
for weeks to have the ruling reversed. Mr.
Beame was having difficulties persuading
Parks Commissioner Newbold Morris to al-
low us to have this simple" privilege. Mr.
Beame arranged for me to have a meeting
with Newbold Morris and on September
3, I met with‘ him for one and a half hours.
Newbold Morris promised to get Dr. Avery
to change his ruling. Mr. Morris too, saw
no Constitutional violation. Because the
Botanic Gardens is partly operated by a

Jew and a member of the Lehman Brothers
investment firm, Mr; Morris said that he
W<,>lIld try to arrange for an ‘amicable solu-
tion' and that I would hear from him in a g
few days.

“I received a letter from the Parksa
Commissioner which to my surprise in-
dicated that 'he still supports Dr. Avery. '

“I mailed a copy of the Commissioner's -4
letter to Abraham Beame. Unable to gettl.
the Commissioner to act, Mr. Beame saw.
Mr. Szold and after a long conversation’!
the matter was settled. It became officialgi
and so announced by the City Comptroller-.5
Beame and Brooklyn B. P. Abe Stark that 3'
we could go to the Botanic Gardens for-3
Tashlich. Several days later, the Mayor'so
office called and the Mayor’s secretary, a
Mr. Sloates, informed me that we could go -1
to the Botanic Gardens in peace and har-',_,
1110115’. every thing wasstraightened out,=9
_and Police Commissioner Murphy wouldu
1nform‘h1s men to arrange matters for our
convenience. We received this news with
great satisfaction.

"On the Friday before Rosh Hashana,
I met with Captain Watercheck of the 74th
Police Pct. and while going over the park
location pointed out that we would not use
the turnstiles but the baby carriage en.
trance which is always open and registers
no numbers. I explained the reasons for it
to the Captain. That was a fortunate point,
for on the morning -of Rosh Hashana, a

private group headed, by Mr. Szold, ea

sergeant came to see me in shul and want- . ~

ed to know if it would be ‘alright for your ,
people to use the turnstiles.’ I told him nogaygg
‘ “At about 12 :30,P.M., Captain Water." ‘.

check accompanied by Deputy Police In-
spector Cashman, came to my shul with the
bad news: Dr. Avery locked the baby car-
riage entrance (fully aware that it was the
only entrance we would use) and could not
be found in his office. He was out for the
day. His chief Assistant at Mr. Thompson
refused to open the gate without consent
from Dr. Avery. Parks Department Head-
quarters did not know what to do and re-
fused to act. Mr. Thompson said he did not
know Dr. Avery’s address or telephone
number.

“I made the following statement to
police officials: ‘We regard this incident
as bigoted beyond words. I believe that
when the thousands of Jews approach the
gates and find them locked, knowing the
background of the situation, they will
definitely riot!’ Worried police officials,
sent for additional men and riot—trained
mounted police. Meanwhile, reporters at
Brooklyn Police Headquarters rushed to
the park. It became a big story.

“It was close to 4 o'clock. In front~of
all newsmen I approached several Garden
officials and demanded that they open the
gates, . ‘Otherwise I will call on Mayor
Wagner to rush here immediately even if
it means violating the high holiday for the
first time in my life.’ Several newspapers
erroneously reported that I called. Actual-
ly, a reporter, feeling sorry for me, called
the Mayor and warned himof the possible
‘not.’ City Hall ordered the police to open
the gates. Assistant Police Inspector Pat.
rick Whalen ordered the emergency squad
to remove the hinges from the big iron
gate. One hour later, five thousand Jews,
most of whom were unaware of the drama
which took place, walked in singing.

“Question: How can a director of a
city garden get away with what seems to
be discriminatory practices? Shouldn't city
officials loolr into this matter? I leave ﬁlo
decision to you.

The Canine Cop
°‘°H 6‘)l

Whenever the subject of dogs doing police work comes up, most people
immediately picture a pack of bloodhounds haying loudly in pursuit of an escaped
criminal through bush and across lonely swamps. That is far from the truth of what
actually takes place.

First of all, bloodhounds are not vicious, as ﬁction would have us believe,
and in police work dogs usually operate singly, never in packs. Incidentally, there
are no bloodhounds in the RCMP Dog Section. Also, the function of dogs in law
enforcement is not solely to chase criminals; they perform many other important
duties such as ﬁnding lost persons and things, guarding property, locating caches of
stolen articles and illegal merchandise, jobs of that nature.

They are friendly only to their masters——one-man dogs, in other words—
still they are not savage or cross as very many people seem to think. They are
tolerant, good-natured and obedient. Sometimes circumstances make it necessary for
them to pursue a criminal or an escaped convict, and in such cases they carry out
their duty relentlessly, forcing the criminal to surrender. But they "do not molest him.

The RCMP Dog Section began in 1935 with two dogs, Dale and Black Lux.
Two years previously Dale had assisted in tracking an automobile thief to his home,
the ﬁrst of many successful cases in his career as a ﬁghter of crime. In 1936 another
dog, Sultan, was taken on the strength, and with the training of these three four-
footed policemen, dogs became a vital factor in carrying out certain RCMP duties..

The number of dogs in the Section increased, of course, as time went on,
varying through the years, and included were such breeds as German Shepherd, Cross
Labrador-Shepherd, Doberman Pinscher, Reisenschnauzer and others. In recent years
the Force has bred dogs for this service, but still acquires some from outside sources.

Each animal, generally speaking, serves about nine years, during which time
it has and obeys only one handler or dog master. The dog is taught, groomed,
exercised and fed by the dog master, and when there is work to do they operate
as a team.

Training, which usually lasts a year, starts when the dog has lost its puppyhood
playfulness and is old enough to be taught obedience. The exercises embrace many

"The Police Dog is Entirely Trustworthy!“

tasks which require skill, perseverance and intelligence; and when the course is
completed the service dog is adept in many, if not all, of the following undertakingsz.
trailing, climbing, scaling walls, warning the police of danger, guarding police cars or
stolen goods, rescuing persons from drowning, overtaking and disarming ﬂeeing
criminals. ~

Primary training consists of teaching the dog instant obedience, until he
responds quickly and smoothly to such commands as heel, sit, down, up, fetch and
others. Day after day this patient drilling goes on, and then when the student
exhibits certain characteristics which signify he is ready for it, he is taken on his
ﬁrst assignment. In this phase of his career he is introduced to the scientiﬁc angle,
as it were, of canine police work. The outdoors, farmland and bush country, homes
and sometimes shops are his laboratory in which he conducts his type of search and
investigation, and as time goes on he becomes more and more proﬁcient.

When the course is over, dog and master are posted to a certain locality,
ready to answer the various calls to duty. In between special assignments, the daily
exercises continue, keeping the dog in good condition and alert to what is expected
of him. Every year the team returns to training headquarters for a refresher course.
It is on record that one dog took the training so seriously that he was found all alone
one evening on the training ground rehearsing the drill exercises.

Perhaps the noblest function of the dog section is the ﬁnding of lost persons.
Young children and frequently the aged wander from their homes and become lost;
hunters too sometimes lose their way in dense bush, and it is in such cases as these
that the dog excels.

There was the case of a little girl two and a half years old. Her name was
Barbara, and one April afternoon she left her home, tcddled into the woods nearby,
unconcerned about ﬁnding her way back. Deeper and deeper she wandered into the
bush, too young to realize her danger. ' '

_ Meanwhile her parents discovered that she was missing and started to hunt
for her, asking their neighbours to help. The search party spread out, calling the
child’s name at intervals and examining every thicket as they advanced. Though
they worked a long time, and went as far as they believed it was possible for Barbara
to have gone, their eﬁorts were unsuccessful.

Night. was coming on, and Barbara’s parents were“ frantic with worry and
grief as they thought of their little girl spending the night all alone in the cold April
woods . ‘

Police Service Dog Wolf was sent for, given scent from Barbara’s clothes and
‘told to ﬁnd her. In a few seconds he had his nose to the ground, following a trail
that led down old logging roads and well past where the search party had given up.

4

A number of war dogs trained by the buartemaster Corps established
outstanding records overseas. At least one member of the "K-9 Corps"
was awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart by an overseas commando

i

Presently he began tugging on his leash, which indicated that he was nearing the end
of his search, and sure enough, a short distance farther on they found Barbara cold
and wet and frightened, but otherwise unharmed.

Another case involved a woman 86 years old. Like Barbara, she too lost
her way in wild bush country, and for three days a search party looked for her in vain.
Finally Police .Service Dog Sultan joined in the search, and instantly his keen nose
caught the scent. In less than half an hour he led his master through thickets and
shrubbery to a dense clump of willows, and there they found the missing woman
huddled on the ground, weak and exhausted from exposure and hunger.

There was one strange feature about this case. Nearing the end of the search,
the dog master had released Sultan from the leash, and the dog raced ahead. But
he didn’t bark when he found the lost woman, which was queer, as police dogs are
taught to do so. However there was good reason for it; the aged woman was so
overcome with joy that she threw her'arms around Sultan’s neck and clasped him
so hard he could barely breathe. “The dog is my saviour,” she cried.

One time Sultan was ordered to pursue a man ﬂeeing through the bush. He
did and knocked the fugitive down, then stood guard till the police arrived. After-
wards the man said that he wasn’t hurt, and that all he felt was his knees being knocked
from under him. Which indicates that far from being vicious, police dogs are gentle,
unless circumstances force them to be otherwise.

Another time, a Manitoba farmer while cutting cats in a large ﬁeld lost his
bill-fold. He looked for it, but was unable to ﬁnd it. Then one of our dogs was
put to work on it and in a short time his sensitive nose located the lost wallet inside
a sheaf of oats. ,

A funny thing happened one day in one of our detachments. Two policemen
on patrol stopped at a store on the highway to get something, and a dog followed
them in. There was a man in shabby clothes at the counter, making a purchase.
When he turned to leave he saw the dog and stopped short, looking concerned.
Suddenly he swung toward the two policemen and said he’d go without making
any fuss. He told them that he had heard about our dogs and that it was no use
trying to fool them. Upon "being questioned, he divulged that he was guilty of
making and selling illegal liquor. But the irony of the case was that the dog was
not a police dog; he was just a stray mongrel that happened to follow the ‘policemen
into the store.

Some years ago two of our dogs, Tell and Ignatz, worked together to help solve
a burglary case in a small western town. A general store was entered during the
darkness shortly before dawn, the safe was blown open and the contents stolen.
A neighbour, awakened by the sound of the explosion, saw three men running down
the road.

‘ REFLECTIVE GROUP.

"1 think that if one accepts the myth of race (& it is,
I believe, not entirely necessary altho, perhaps, some-
times useful to do so), then, a case can be made out for
differences in capability and character of the various
(ahem} races. Yes, I think such a case can be made out.
The only question I should raise, however, would be:
where should the races htand?

In my scale of values I would hesitate to put the so-
called white race first. Nor can I think of a race I
would wish to put above the Negro, unless it be the
Chinese, or Japanese, or Indian. But then again are the
Chinese or Japanese or Indians a race? And have I suff-
icient hnowledge of all the other races? And then again
what is 'race' at all?“

Dr. Kwetch in "An Imaginary Novel"

Fxounn 68. This ﬁgure gives an excellent idea of’ the relation of
the external senses and impressoria. to the nerves and brain. The
two faces, A and B, are greatly in contrast, in regard to the devel-
opment of the lips and nose, the external organs of the senses,
which relate to tact and smell. The most reﬁned races and families
of men have the external organs and face—bones small, as in A ; and
the‘~most rural and uncultivated are like B;

   
 

The investigators found the footprints of three men in a ﬁeld, and Tell followed
them for over a mile, then in a coulee came upon a discarded paper shopping bag.
He continued the search, trailing across a highway and through more ﬁelds where
it was noticed that there were only two sets of footprints. Finally Tell entered a
farmyard and stopped before the barn. A

Inside, the investigators found two men hiding in the loft. These men were
barefooted, and further search uncovered two pairs of shoes smeared with oil of
mustard, apparently in an attempt to throw the dogs off the scent. The two strangers
were later identiﬁed as men who had previously been convicted of safe-blowing.

Back at the coulee where Tell had found the shopping bag, Ignatz was put on
the scent, and he soon found a pair of gloves covered with soap and three pairs of
socks. Though it was never veriﬁed, the explanation could be that the socks had been
removed because they had soaked up some of the oil of mustard from the shoes,
which burnt the fugitives’ feet. Oil of mustard smarts when dropped on ﬂesh.

However,-the following day a man was seen in the coulee and when questioned,
he denied ever being with the other two men. Tell, when put on his back track,
led the way to some brush where a rough bed of grass had been made and slept on.
The third man also had oil of mustard on his shoes and in addition there were
traces of soap, the kind used in safe—blowing. Subsequently all three suspects were
tried and convicted.

Tell travelled over 25,000 miles on police investigations during his years of
service.

Trailing chicken thieves is another duty the dogs are good at. One man had
formed the habit of stealing his neighbours’ chickens whenever he felt like having
fowl for dinner. The owner ﬁnally complained to the police, and Wolf was given the
job of getting the evidence. He led the dog master across a potato patch into a swamp
where they came upon chicken feathers scattered about and bloodstains. Continuing,
they eventually came to a man’s backyard. The man denied the crime, stating he
knew nothing about it, but when he was told how the dog had tracked him from the
chicken coop to his home, he confessed. The missing chickens were found in his
cellar. I

The work our dogs do is sometimes astounding. For example,’ the time
Sultan found a stolen watch in deep snow. A fruit pedlar stole the timepiece from
the home of a customer and was well on his way before the theft was discovered.
He was overtaken that evening eighteen miles from the scene of the crime, questioned
and searched; but the investigators failed to ﬁnd any evidence.

POLICE DOG ‘MADE.’
1.000 ARRESTS

From Our Own Correspondent
NAIROBI. Wednesday.

Sultan was brought along to see if he could help. Instantly his nose went up,
and he trotted to a snowbank about thirty feet from the road. His paws worked
like scissors and snow ﬂew in all directions as he burrowed his way down. In a short
time he lifted his head, and in his mouth was the watch, still ticking. The thief had
thrown it away when he saw the police approaching.

Cliﬁe is the name of another RCMP dog with a long list of successful cases.
One day this shaggy-coated‘ Reisenschnauzer was assisting investigators in New
Brunswick. The suspect, when he saw the police approaching, ran into a swamp,
and it looked as if he would escape. Cliffe, ordered to follow him, soon ran him to
a stop, then stood guard until the police got close enough to make the arrest. Cliffe
was then put to work tracking, and after leading the dog master more than three
miles, located a cabin in which was the evidence sought by the investigators.

Police dogs are stationed at various points in Canada, but naturally, all RCMP
detachments do not have them. When a dog is needed he is taken to the scene in a
two-door sedan from which the back seat has been removed. A specially-constructed
wire screen behind the front seat provides a rear compartment in which the dog is
quite comfortable as he answers the call to duty. He arrives fresh and ready for work.

Many crimes which are still unsolved might have been concluded successfully
with the help of a dog; In one case a dog followed a trail and found a button which
was a vital link in a chain of evidence that convicted the criminal. But even if they
did not play such an important role in ﬁghting crime, the humanitarian angle of their
accomplishments, and by that I mean saving lives by ﬁnding lost persons, would seem
to be ample justiﬁcation for enlisting their help in police work. They are not cruel
or dangerous as some people believe, and frequently they succeed when the attempts
of human beings meet with failure.

Sad things too happen in the Dog Section. Like humans, dogs eventually grow
too old for service, and in 1944 that was Su1tan’s fate.’ He had served faithfully for

eight years, and then it was decided that his days of usefulness were over. On '

June 13, 1944, he was discharged, so to speak, from the Force and given to the
dog master with whom he had worked for so many years. However, he didn't live
long to enjoy his well-earned rest; he died early the following month.

It has been said that a man's dog stands by him in prosperity and poverty,
in health and sickness. We could add to that and say that some dogs stand for
liberty and justice, and spend their whole life executing deeds of mercy and fulﬁlling
their destiny, champions of right against wrong. ~

‘ ' V I , 114 .1 " . I '
y_.istor*.' 9_f_  Scotch_-lrish Race
Before history began, there were two

groups oi‘ prehistoric creatures living.
Both peoples were inatcly "serving" peoples
and their country was called Hirelrmd.
There were the blood-colored savages of the
hills :;1d the cannibalistic barbari.-ns of
the lowlands. These Jnttcr were known even
then the world over for the green pigmen-
tation of their respective skins.

In the year it A.D. these two groups
met in an orgy which lasted several hours;
and the result of the orgy is the Scotch-
Irish race as we know it today. This race
lived —a sensual saraba:1de until their bar-
ren land. was lite-r:~J.l:,' slimy with snakes.
Although these people had :1 n;~.tu':a.l affin-
ity for snakes, engaging ever in snake
c'.ances and snake games, their interest soon
w:-nderecl to other less shaky lands. By
this time the race had become much what we
recogzzize as typical. of tlmt race today--
s.~nc‘.y-colored, brown-speckled, thin-nosed,
thin-ligaped.

A man named 'P:.~.trick first thought of
the plan to come to America. For his plan,
i’:.~.tric!: is today _nroc1:~imed;a saint in the
primitive religion of the Scotch-Irish. At
this time the “H" was dropped from Hireland
as a means oi‘ confusing Araericans. i1any of
the immigrants who poured into our country
posed as igwrnnt, illiterate farmers, and
others posed as wealthy landowners in the '
South. Today, still, there are some crea-
tures of Scotch-Irish descent who are com-
fortably posing as loyal and true Americans
and :-re not serving at .111.

DR. NORBERT VANCIP EEL ANSWERS YOUR
QUESTIONS: BOTH RELIGIOUS AND HORAL

It fell my sad lot, at a recent cock-e

"tail party I was invited to while attending

a council of divines on the ‘last Coast, to
be asked thi$ ominous question by my hostess,
one Hrs. Laws. "Tell me, doctor, what shall
I do? hy son is obviously infatuated with a
young Scotch-Irish cafe-society entertainer
and wishes the family's approval to marry
her, Simultaneously I breathed a prayer of
heart-felt thanks and a humble petition to
God for this miserable woman in her plight.
is every true Southerner will understand, my
thanks were rendered because of our overwhel-
mingly victorious battle over miscegenation
with the Scotch-Irish in the South. However,
we cannot completely ignore the crucial sit-
uation oi‘ our brethren in the Northern and
Western portions of our great nation.

TRIAL CLIHAXES

Addit, Mississippi:. The trial of s ‘:teen-
year-old nlexander Graham Tell, young
Scotch—Irish boy hauled into court for in-
sulting pretty Hrs. Ruby Jean Iiollofield,
23, reached its climax yesterday when A,J.
Elliss, prosecuting attorney, pronomaced,
"This trial may verywell cast the dye»
either for keeping our blood pure or for
mongrelizing with the Scotqh—Irish. If
Tell is- set free, the bars are down, and
the undefilecl heritage of our ancestors is
at an end. '!

I-(rs. ilollofield, wife of blond young
farmer Lonnie 1-Iollofield, told the court '
that as she passed Tell-on the street, he
turned to a companion and whispered, "What
a wee bonny lassie!" She immediately re-
ported the offencs to her husband, who had
Tell arrested. The -boy did not deny say-
ing this, but said he meant it merely as a
canpliment.

Attorney Elliss asked that the boy be
given agsevere prison sentence for his of-
fence. "Such audacity and lewdness," he
said, "are the norm of behavior for a peo-
ple whosehistory includes such notorious
figures as Mary Qzeen of Scots and Macbeth.
‘more can be no compromise with them."

, Red-haired young Tell, wearing; the
plaids of his clan, is being ke‘-at under
heavy guard at the county jail for fear
that the citizens of lddit, among whom
feeling over the incident is running very
high, will throw him into the river with a
horseeollar around his neck.

BOYS WILL BE SCOUTS

Minnowsville, hississippi: Last night a
happy, jovial Irish Wake was disturbed when
a troup of mischievous’ Boy Scouts descended
upon it like Philistines on Assyrians, cast-
ing acid about -irrcspectively. Cries of
"Root man!" and "Begorrah" were heard in the
night, and the Wake was postponed indefin-
itely. There are rumors to the effect that
one Scotch-Irish national was painted with
luminous paint and set nfirc, but there are
neither witnesses nor ashes to substantiate
this unofficial report. It is honestly be-
lieved that the Scotch-Irish are indignant
over the affair. J.P. Hcsweensy, who shout-
ed in the middle of the fray, "I wish you
wouldn't do that anymore," is in critical
condition in 4"s'.rmoIv'svi11e County Hospital.

A Christian ' s Prayer

when sunset paints the western sky

All rosy’-red in hue
I like to pause and thank my God
He died for Scotchmen, too.

Lord, help me to remember well
This earth the Master trod

Not just for me, but for them too.
We all belong to God.

L5T_T.§R. I9 E'1§ 921293

Dear Sir:

I do not believe God wants us to mix
with the Scotch-Irish, else why did he put
them off on a little island by themselves?
They do not want integration any more than
we do. I love the Scotch-Irish, but only
if they stay in the place God appointed
for them. A careful 1*e:xdin,g of the Holy
Bible will show you God's stand on segre-
gation. John 22 :19 and Marl: 17:11: tell us
what the Master said on the subject.

The Scotch-Irish have only been in
this country two hundred years. Before
that they lived in the highlands of Scot-

sland, totally without washing machines, el-

ectric lights, automobiles, and all the
other basic elements of civilization, and
dressed only in the rudest sort of kilts.
Furthcrnwrs, I maintain that after two hun-
dred years, they are still scotc‘n-Irish,-
and no amount of civilization will change
the fact. I think I need not point out to
you the basic immorality of their ch:.rnct-
ers. There is hardly a one of them that
does not got divorced and eat meat on ‘Fri-
days. Their music, as typified by such
dances as the 313 or the highland fling,
is characteristically lewd and shows ﬁxo
primitive rhythms of the highlands from
whence they came.

I have a little daughter, a sweet
cherubic little girl, and sooner would I
take up anus as my Grandfather did in '61
and pour out nw'life's blood before I would
see her go to school with Scotch-Irish chil-
dren. The tragic results of such a contnct--
perhaps someday red-haired, freckle-faced
children with such names as Patrick or in-
drew--would be too much for me. May the
Lord take me before such a day arrives,

I am willing to grant that the scotch-
Irish have given us a few great men--like
Andrew Carnegie, or Robert Burns, for in-
stance, but for the most part they have
shamefully wasted the opportunities that
our great land has given them.

Again, let me repeat: let the rabble-
rousers do what they may, the Scotch-Irish
were meant to till the soil: God has ap-
pointed it. (Genesis 52:2) we are kind to
them, lot them keep their place.

Respectfully,
Stanislaus Wockinsky

Scotch-Irish _i__.u_s_ig_

Shall Dr.Kcrshee replace our songs
with the primitive jigs and reels of the
green tribes!

For a sailor and ou1cr savages, a jig
or a reel is a common occurrence. After a
day of hunting or fishinﬁy it is quite na-
tural for a Scotch-Irishor to break into a
wild dance of sensual abandon. In their
own land todmy the Scotch-Irish still per-
form gigs and reels of grotesque dimensions.
Modeni science describes this 'dance' as a
nexvous twitching of indefinite length. One
cannot imagine the un«Christian manipula-
tions involvcd in a jig or a reel. And I
here shudder with emotion pondering this.

The musical debility of the Scotch-
Irish is not confined to jigs and reels.
The green tribes sing a song of inordinate
love for their respective mothers, usually
culminating with the word ‘mother' on a
very high and native tone. Such songs, bo-
lievo it or not, are sung today in certain
isolated sections of this country.

THE EDITOR THINKS. . . .

that they do in the North is the bus-
iness of the North. They have their pro-
blems (many) and we have ours, There seem
to be individuals up North who do not re-
cognize the fact that we as Southerners
have a different, and entirely different,
set of problems from those of other sec-
tions in our great and united country.
These individuals would cause us embarrass-
ment ovor our own grobloms. ﬂiey want con-
fusio and chaos where once beauty reigned.
They are probably Communists. At least
they are jackasses, and there are at least
nine of these jackasscs north of the Ma-
son's Dixon Line. They would make us the
subject of their ridicule and abuse which
has been and is being heaped on us irres-
pectively. They forget where all the pres-
idents prior to the late war hailed from.
They don't remember where culture and ‘
beauty and lovely women were born. Let me
remind them for you. And let me assure
them that we shall keep our race pure as
keep it pure we must, as keep it pure we
shall. As keep it pure God willed. As
keep it pure Christ died for. ~Does the
good book leave any doubt as to how our
South must be? I don't think so.

we of the South know and love and un-
derstand our Scotch-Irish nationals. we
admire those few of them who have genuine-
ly contributed to our fair land-- KL C.
Fields, to name one of a few. Yes, we
know them, friends. We know and accept
that the Scotch-Irish are to a man dirty,
ignorant, drunk, and musically inclined.

We are prepared to handle them as we al-
ways have, with love and respect and an
over present understanding of their own
particular problems. to have taken them
from savagery and taught them as much as
it was possible to teach them. Why, they
have come further in the past fifty years
with our guidance than any other race in
the history of our terrestrial ball. So
why change things? It's all very well to
have principles when you are young and paw-
erless, but let's be realistic. Milk is a
delightful, nourishing food. Orange juice
is also possible in its place. Now, if we
nix milk with orange juice, what do we have?
I ask in all seriousness, for this is the
eventuality we must always face. Can some
person, whether gentleman, lady, or blue-
eyed child, sugges to me the God-serving
purpose of milky orange juice. In the
ocean, friends, in the ocean. Each entity
is extraordinarily meaningful in its place.
Each, praise God, serves functions especi-
ally designed for it alone. In his place a
Scotch-Irish creature is a joy and a dc-
light 1n_his place. Let us dwell on that--
in his place. '

Certainly many of us remember a sweet
old fat Irish woman somewhere in our past
who cooked for us and served us as only she
could. Such memories are be:mtiful and we
treasure them. It is part of our heritage.
Most of us also realize that these fat,
sweet, old Scotch-Irish women are growing
fewer and fewer with the passing of each
hour. Alas, the young ones are smart al-
ocks. They know they are like fish out of
water, but, seeing the apparent success of
their brethren in the North, they would fly
in the face of their only true friends and
protectors.
