MINE-MILL President John
Clark, speaking for the union
and its leadership, immediately
set the record straight.

In a news release issued with-
in hours after announcement of
the SACB order, Clark made
three main points clear: that
thedecision of the Board “has
no ' basis in fact,” that “the
union’s status and its right to
bargain collectively are in no
way affected by the Board's
order,” and that the union
would act without delay under
the law to prove that it is not
“Communist-infiltrated.”

On May 31, Mine-Mill filed a
post-order petition with the
SACB to set aside its findings

UIAWI Opposes ‘Governmental
Harassment’ of Mine-Mill

ATLANTIC CITY N. J .-—The AFL-CIO’s largest interna-
tional union last month went on record in defense of Mine-
Mi_ll against “governmental harassment.”

The powerful United Auto Workers specifically stated
its opposition both to the SACB proceedings against Mine-
Mill and the conspiracy prosecution of Mine-Mill leaders.
It called for the protection of Mine-Mill’s civil liberties in
the interest of all labor.

A major civil liberties resolution of the million-member
UAW 18th Constitutional Convention declared in part:

“We oppose governmental harassment of the International
Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers . . . the civil liber-
ties of that Union must be protected in the interest of in-
suring the civil liberties of all unions.vThe conspiracy prose-
cution of the leaders ofiMine-Mill for conspiring to file false

non-communist affidavits was a transparent effort to use
thisancient anti-union device to avoid the necessity of prov-
ing the actual filing of such false affidavits. The proceeding
against Mine-Mill before the Subversive Activities Control,
Board is an assault upon the rights of free speech and free
association of all unions . V. .”

A The UAW resolution also criticized ,"“the repressive .
methods” of the‘ McCarran Act under which the SACB case '
against Mine-Mill was instituted. A _ _ :

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

1 President's Corner:

Anaconda Split-off

Serves the Company

WELVE years of unabated raiding concentration from
the outside in collusion with constant Trojan Horse
disruption of company-minded elements on the inside
have finally managed to split Local 117 away from its

traditional unity with the rest of the Anaconda workers

in Montana.

The combined forces of Chemical and In-
dependent raiders and disrupters, eliminated
on the first ballot April 19-20, were thrown
behind the main raiding union, Steel, in the
run-off election on May 8-9_ and Steel won.

It was a sad outcome not only for the work-
ers under the Anaconda Company’s empire in
Montana, but for all unions, despite the fact
that Steel’s massive assault on Mine-Mill’s
basic jurisdiction was smashed everywhere
else in the country.

The main beneficiary of the Local 117 elec-
tion is the Anaconda Company now given an

 

Clark
advantage to pit one group of workers against another which it
had to .a lesser extent in past years with the separation of the
crafts from the miners and smeltermen.

*‘k*

- HE despicable action of Steel in breaking Local 117 away from
Tjoint bargaining of the Mine, Mill and Smeltermen in Montana
has now given the company a three-way game to play. Is there
any doubt they will play it to the hilt? As a matter of fact there is
already the report that the company has made an offer to the
craft unions which the crafts have presumably rejected,

Labor in general has been up in arms at the drive by the
National Association of Manufacturers and Chamber of Commerce
for legislation to outlaw industry-wide and company-wide bargain-
ing. The employer organizations don’t need any law, to accomplish
their purpose of weakening the bargaining power of industrial
unions. All they need to do is keep supporting such marauding
union-busters as the Steel leaders to get their job done for them.

That is the disgrace and the tragedy of the labor movement
today, as other honest union leaders, both in and out of the AFL-
CIO, have been pointing out. .

*k**k

am sure that the workers in our major company chains—Phelps

Dodge, AS&R and Magma Copper——who have settled their
contracts in united bargaining with outstanding gains, are happy
that these disruptive and unprincipled forces were not able to
-break up their bargaining. I am sure as well that the crafts and
even the Steel rank and file membership in some of these hold-
ings" feel the same way.

Having been in Montana during the Local 117 election, I was
able to witness one of the most corrupt union-splitting campaigns
on record—and, yes, one of. the most dishonest. Wild, pie-in-the-
sky promises of contract gains to be made were put forth by the
‘Steel raiders.

It made one wonder what has happened to the miners and
smeltermen under Steel in Upper Michigan, in Park City, Utah,
in Iron King in Arizona and other places where Steel has its
mercenary strangle-hold. Their contracts in those places are so
shameful they dare not publicize them.

*‘k*

F course, we regret losing Anaconda Local 117 and the many
good union men who knew and understood what joint bar-
gaining means with Butte, Great Falls and East Helena.

It is not the first time that the workers at the Anaconda
smelter have been diverted from their unity with the others. In-
ternal disruption by local leaders during the 1959 strike tore that
local away from bargaining with the Montana Negotiating Com-
mittee and into a separate settlement which prolonged the strike
and cost the workers their just due.

We believe this set-back is temporaryfand will be overcome

in due course with the full realization of the many good men in»

volved that they were misled into forgetting what Anaconda Com-
pany workers have always fought for from the beginning—unity in
dealing with their giant employer.—JOHN CLARK

Morenci Miners .
in Wide Activity

Morenci Miners Union Local
616 has been involved in a wide
variety of activity recently——po-
litical, civic and sports'—in the
Clifton—Moren_ci‘ area.

The local helped elect one of
its own members, Julio Tavison,
to a two-year term in the Clifton
City Council.

It has joined with other unions
in the area toiform a Greenlee
County Committee for Political
Education (see separate story
elsewhere in this issue).\

This year again, as in the
past, the local is sponsoring two
high school students to the Ari-
zona “Boys State” meetings, a
junior citizen event, being held
June 7-13 on the campus of the
Arizona State College at Flag-
staff. One student each from
Morenci and Clifton is chosen
by the local to attend the an-
nual gathering conducted under
the auspices of the state’s
American Legion.

A Peewee Little League Team
is once more being sponsored by
the Mine—Mill membership. The

team, which usually places high

in the League, is coached by
Antonio Murillo, Local 616 Ex-
ecutive Board member from the
P—D Open Pit Division.

The Local’s May Newsletter,
distributed to the membership,
reported on the SACB case, and
reiterated condemnation of the
charges and support of Mine-

Mill signed by Local 616 Presi--

Los Angeles Discharge Case Won

LOS ANGELES, Calif. — A luctance to accept the assign-

3-man arbitration panel has
ordered reinstatement of a Los
Angeles Local 700 member who
-was fired by American Brake
Shoe Company on the charge
of insubordination for refusing
.a work assignment. Even the
company-appointed member of
the panel concurred in the arbi-
tration -award.

Elam Curtis, hired in 1956,
worked as a Cupola Tender for
21/2 years, then was granted his
request for reclassification to
the lower-paying job of Cupola
Repairman because of fear and
nervousness at the hazards of
burns from molten metal. He

' later bid into the job of Transfer

Car Operator.

 On February 28, 1962, he was
directed to work on the Cupola
i.n the absence ‘of the regular

 Tender, and even.-though hein-
< gformedf the foreman‘ o,f;hi_,s re‘-1 :‘

merit, Curtis worked on the job
for two days then refused to
operate the Cupola on the third
day because he was getting more
“nervous and frightened.”
=l< ¢Z< *1:

ON March 5 he was dis-
charged for insubordination in
refusing a direct order to oper-
ate the Cupola. The union filed
a grievance.

The arbitration panel upheld
the union’s position that Curtis’

— health was a mitigating factor

and that his discharge was an
overly severe penalty even
though, the panel said, his re-
fusal to accept the Cupola work
assignment was insubordination-.

“Because of the mitigating
circumstances
cussed,” the arbitration panel
said, “a lesser penalty would
appear appropriate.” Curtis was

ordered ;‘-‘,to,be.~ reinsta,ted'fo1§i;},1.. ,:

heretofore dis- ..

with to the classification of
Transfer Car Operator with full

seniority and all_ other rights’

accruing him under the Labor
Agreement and with no back
pay for the period between his
suspension and his reinstate-
ment on April 23.” ‘

The long strike, marked at
one point by the importation of

FOR -State Senator, labor-en-

top vote to move into a run-off

A special victory -"for the com-

County Commissioner election
of Richard Telles, brother of
former El Paso Mayor Ray-

El Paso County Judge Wood-

‘ them a place in the run-off or

were elected outright.

All in all, it was a very happy
election for labor in El Paso

this was partly due to the Re-
publican primary, the first, di-
verting some 5,000 conservative
votes which in the past were
cast in the County’s Democratic

Negro also won a place in the run-off primary May 29.

_ The election made history with its precedent-breaking outcome. It was the first
time in the existence of the County, largest in Alabama, that Negroes were elected

to serve on the Democratic
Executive Committee.

Three of the Negro candi-
dates» won seats by virtue‘ of no
opposition. The other three won
out over white opponents.

ONE of the latter, was Attor-
ney David H. Hood. , ,

Hood was the attorney for
Mine-Mill Vice- President As-
bury Howard three years ago
when Howard was mobbed,
beaten and jailed for having a

poster painted urging Negroes

to -register and vote. The poster

said: “Vote Today -for a Bet-

Howard acted as Hood's: cam-

primary election.

HOOD was elected in Pre-
cinct 33, District 1 at Bessemer
City Hall. This is where How-
ard was attacked in early 1959
before being sentenced to serve
time on a prison work gang.

Particularly active in the

.campaign to elect Hood as the

first of his race to hold Demo-
cratic party office in the Besse-
mer“cut-off” was the Bessemer
Voters League. The League, is
a civic organization of‘ citizens
in West Jefferson County de-

g voted to; encouraging. the regis- .

tration of Negroes to vote in
political elections. Its President
is Asbury Howard.

Also» active in the primary
campaign were members of
four Mine"-Mill locals in the
Bessemer - Birmingham area:
Local 553 in Fairfield, Local
830 in Birmingham, and Locals
531 and 481 in Bessemer.

The Negro candidates at first
were refused qualification by
the County Democratic Execu-

Palma turned‘ to- Mine-Mill for

assistance, and Local 470 lea'd- -

General Counsel:

Press Stories Distort

SACB Case Effects  

have rarely seen such distortion as there has been in

the press about the SACB decision. Practically all the
stories and comment say, or imply, that Mine-Mill now
may not use the National Labor Relations Board, may
not bargain with the employers, etcetera.

This is simply not so!

The ‘law plainly provides that until the
coiirts review the decision of the SACB, the
decision is not final and Mine-Mill's status is

not affected in any way.

Within 60 days of the decision of the
SACB, we have the right to file a petition in
the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington,
asking that the SACB decision be set aside.

Of course, we plan to file such a petition.

Then, if we lose in the Court of Appeals,
we have the right to ask the Supreme Court of
the United States to review the case.
process should take as much as three or four

years.

 

This

Witt.

***

REPEAT—until we have exhausted these judicial remedies, the
decision of the SACB has absolutely no effect.

In addition, there is another procedure available to us.

Under

the law, we have the right to file a petition with the SACB that we

are not now a _“Communist-infiltrated" organization.

The Inter-

national Executive Board has decided that such a petition should

be filed.

_ If the SACB upholds the petition——as I think it should--that
will end the entire case. But if the SACB decides against us, we
have the same rights of court review of that decision as in the case

take both positions.

I am as confident as I always have been that we will prevail
in this case as we have in the other cases in the past.

Pending our final vindication, no member of Mine-Mill. should

be misled about the legal effect of the SACB decision.

AT .the same time, Clark also
announced that the union was
undertaking another action open
to it under the law to have the
SACB case dismissed in the
courts.

Pointing out that the SACB
order is subject to appeal up to
the Supreme Court of the United
States, Clark said that, in addi-
tion to the petition filed with
the Board, “we shall be filing a
petition for judicial review of
the Board’s order with the Fed-
eral Court of Appeals in Wash-
ington, D. C.” I

As the union has previously
noted, the SACB case rests"on
the testimony of a few inform-
ers, professional witnesses and
persons who had been fired by
Mine-Mill, like Fred Gardner

FURTHER, there are a great
number of legal issues involved
in the case-, including constitu-

In this connection, Clark said:

Mine-Mill Continues Pressure
On Mine Safety Study Inaction

DENVER—Mine-Mill pressure is continuing to break through the pall of inaction
which suddenly developed in April on the Mine Safety Study authorized last year
by Congress as the responsibility of the Interior Department.

How the Safety Study is to be run was still shrouded in the bureaucratic mys-
teries of the Department of Interior at Mine-Mill presstime May 29.

As reported last month,
the program of mine safety‘
surveys and mine fatality inves-
tigations which had been con-
ducted by the U. S. Mines Bu-
reau ground to a sudden halt in
April.

=1: tit =24

SINCE then a storm of pro-
test from Mine-Mill locals, the
International office and West-
ern Congressmen and Senators
resulted in the investigations of
mine fatalities being resumed
late in April.

For example: the investiga-
tion into the fatal accident April
8 of Ben Sanchez of Ruth, Nev.,
Local 124, which was suddenly
halted right in the middle, was
resumed and completed; the fa-
tal accident April 24 of Pilar
Contreras, member of Local 616
at the Phelps Dodge open pit in
Morenci, Ariz., which the Bu-
reau of Mines said it was unable
to investigate on orders from
Washington, was also later car-

' ried through.

But the main part of the pro-
gram—general safety surveys
of all important mines——was
still on dead center at the end
of May.

* =3 =l<

THERE were a number of de-
velopments flowing from com-
munications of the International
office to administration officials
and congressmen.

Early last month, on May 4,
Assistant Interior Secretary
John M. Kelly wrote to Presi-
dent Clark saying the program
had been “temporarily "sus-
pended pending certain" admin-
istrative decisions.” Kelly add-
ed: “Inasmuch as the problems
ha,V.e been resolved satisfac-

Mill has “received wide en-
couragement from many unions
throughout the country” in it-s
fight against legal harassment.

“Only recently,” he pointed.
out, “the United Auto Workers
in convention perhaps best ex-
pressed this sentiment when it
stated, ‘The proceeding against
Mine-Mill before the Subversive

Activities Control Board is an
assault upon the rights of free
speech and free association of
all unions.’ ” '

these non-Communist affidavits
(even -when there was no evi- .
dence a person had actually I
signed one falsely himself), the
situation became one that vio-V
lated all principles of freedom

of conscience and association. It _ 
became part of a whole morass

of thought control and repres-
sion best exemplified by then"
Smith Act ‘ and the McCarran~ .
Act, and the marauding IIouse‘~ ~

torily, the investigations of fa-
tal accidents in metal and non-
metallic mines have been re-
sumed. . . It is anticipated that
other phases of the work will be
started again by the Bureau of
Mines within a few days.”

On May 9, Lee C. White, As-
sistant Special Counsel to Presi-
dent Kennedy, wrote President
Clark that “while certain field
studies have been halted, it is
anticipated thatthey will be re-
sumed within a short time.”

SOMETHING within the slow-
moving Interior Departmenthas
held up the expected resumption
of work. Department of Interior
spokesmen W e r e tight-lipped
about what was going on. One
hint of possible plans afoot was
contained in a letter to Clark
last month from Congressman
Morris K. Udall (D., Ariz.).

‘ Udall, who has been following
developments c l o s e l y, wrote
that “the Department of Inte-
rior informs me that it is setting

up a small, impartial committee .

to assist in carrying out the
mine safety survey authorized
by Public Law 87-300.. . . . Most
of the study will, of course, be
carried out by personnel of the
U. S. Bureau of Mines.”
Mine-Mill had received no of-
ficial confirmation of that re-
port by the end of May, but was
hoping that the survey would
soon be under full steam again.

MEANWHILE, another par-
tial breakthrough in the Interior
Department’s program of inac-

.,tion came toward the end of

May. , . _ . V
Local 890 reported ‘Ricardo Si-

Clothing Union
Will Demand
"Shorter Week)

, ATLANTIC CITY, N. J .—Dele-
gates to the Amalgamated Cloth-
ing Workers convention here
last month emphatically au-
thorized the demand for a 35-
hour workweek with no reduc-
tion in pay as a major goal_in

the union’s negotiations next;

year in the men’s coat and suit
industries.

Besides calling for the shorter
workweek in its own industries,
the convention of the 400,000-
member union passed a‘ similar
resolution urging Congress to
make the 35-hour week a na-
tional standard by amending the
fair labor standards act.

. The action was taken despite
the declaration by Labor Sec-
retary Arthur Goldberg, a con-
vention guest speaker, that the
administration is opposed to the
reduction of hours as a cure for
economic ills or unemployment.

Another convention speaker,
AFL-CIO P r e s i d e nt George
Meany, drew a standing ovation
from the delegates when he pre-
dicted that the merged federa-
tion will launch a national cam-
paign for the 35-hour week with-
out reduction in pay unless “we
very quickly see the end of this
unemployment problem.”

Liberal Legislaton Prospects
Ride on Off-Year Vote Trend

WASHINGTON, D. C.—In 1934, an off-year election, nine additional Democrats
were swept into Congress to help support President Roosevelt's anti-depression pro-
grams. That was a unique year. .

In no other off-year election in the 20th Century has an administration in the

White House added to its Congressional strength. In fact, in all other off-year elec- -

tions, the administration has
lost seats in Congress. The

average off-year loss to the ,

party in power during the last
50 years has been nine percent.
>, Now we face another off-year
election, and this is a year
when tradition, if it sticks,

-could spell disaster to the pros-

pects for good legislation help-
ful to working people.
:1: :1: :1:

I  present split in Congress
is 263 Democrats, 174 ‘Republi-

cans. But the figures are mis-
leading, for the reactionary co-
alition can block just about any
billit cares to. Actually, at full
strength, the coalition can

muster a majority in the House.
What is the likely conse-
quence if the coalition retains
control? Liberal legislation will
have as much chance of squeez-
ing through Congress as an ele-
phant has of squeezing through
a needle’s eye. Possibly, as a
result of horse-trading, some
good legislation might see the
light of day, but this would
come only at the expense of
other progressive laws.
President Kennedy has made
many good legislative propos-
als.(In most cases, their chances
ride on the outcome of the Fall
elections, when all House seats

and 38 Senate seats are a
stake. , -

I'll’!

IF the off-year tradition ap-
plies, there would barely be
any hope for passage of good
laws. Even holding the line
would not be enough. The plain
fact is, liberal seats must be
added in Congress, some 20-30
of them. ,

Can union members help,

turn -the trick? The answer is‘

yes. They can elect a liberal
Congress if they make sure
they and their families and
friends are ‘registered, and if
they then make certain to vote
on election day.

Working people comprise 37
percent of voting age popula-
tion. Yet in 1960, they made up
only 26 percent of those who
voted. At the game time, execu-
tive and professional people,
who make up only 18 percent
of voting age population, were
26, percent of those who actually
voted. Thus, a group compris-
ing 19 percent less of the vot-
ing age population than working
people made their votes count
at the polls on an equal basis. -

These and other figures on
the percentage of voting age
persons who actually vote are
sobering. Unless they’re im-
proved on, the Congress .will
continue to sit tight on good
laws. They can be improved on
only if working people partici-
pate fully -in this year’s elec-
tions. And this means;there’s a
job for union members to go all
out in registration and voting
drives. (COPE REPORT)

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

The Anderson-King /Bill

N TWO successive days last month, May 20 and 21, millions of Americans made
up a vast audience at a unique debate between President Kennedy and spokesmen

for the American Medical Association on the issue of medical care for the aged

Social Security Medical Care for the Aged

The Bedside Manner

through Social Security.

President Ken'nedy’s half-hour speech on May 20 was carried by the three tele-
vision networks and most radio stations as a public service. It was delivered at a
mass rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden under the auspices of the National
Council of Senior Citizens for Health Care Through Social Security, which sponsored
simultaneous rallies on the same day in 30 cities across the nation.

The AMA gave its heavily-financed-propaganda answer to the President’s appeal

the next day in TV and ra-
dio programs designed. to
convince the public that the Ad-
ministration-proposed Anderson-
King medical care bill means
“socialized medicine” and “regi-
mentation” of doctors.

The bill itself has been locked
in the House Ways and Means
Committee since early last year.

The 30 rallies on May 20,
spearheaded by President Ken-
nedy’s address in M a d i s o 11
Square Garden, were timed to
build up an avalanche of sup-
port just before the House com-
mittee was finally scheduled to
take up the Anderson-King
measure.

As the Mine—Mil1 Union went

to press, American labor_ and .'

liberals in both parties were
convinced that, free of the com-
mittee, medical care for the
aged through socail security
would become law.
HE ANDERSON-KING
“medicare” bill would give
14,000,000 Americans now 65 or
over life-long insurance against

four major types of health costs .
—without the degrading “means .

test” required by theinadequate
Kerr-Mills bill passed under the
Eisenhower Administration in
1960.

The measure would require
most workers now covered by
Social Security or the Railroad
Retirement system to contribute
approximately 25 cents a week,
during their working years to
be guaranteed health protection
when they become 65.

KIND OF CARE

The four types of health care
covered would be:

- Full hospital services (other
than doctor services) in one
spell, for up to 90 days. Patients
would pay $10 a day for up to

nine days (minimum of $20),

with all care after that free.

- Skilled nursing home serv-
ices following hospitalization for
up to 180 days. (After 60 days
hospitalization, home nursing
services allowed would be re-
duced two days for each addi-
tional day in hospital.)

- Outpatient hospital diagnos-
tic services, including X-ray and
laboratory services, after the
first $20 worth.

- Home health services for up
to 240 visits a year, including
visiting nurse care, therapy and
part-time homemaker services.
. Social Security contribution
rates would be increased one-
quarter of one percent for em-
ployers and employees and
three-eighths of one per cent for
the self-employed starting in
1963. The taxable earnings base
would be increased from $4,800
to $5,000 a year beginning in
1962.

Under the plan there could be
no interference with a patient’s
right to choose his own doctor
and hospital. The Federal Gov-
.ernment would be specifically
prohibited from interfering in
any way with hospital admini-
stration or supervising or con-
trolling the practice of medicine
_ in any fashion. '

HEALTH CARE NEEDED
Its need is tragically simple,

.» though the AMA keeps howling.

' that the majority of older people
‘ in the country do not need help.
The fact remains that most
aged persons have low ‘incomes

year. The average old age _bene-
fit is only $74 a month. a

Rising medical costs are a
mounting threat to the aged,
most of whom have little or no
health insurance protection.
Commercial insurance is either
unavailable because of age, or
too expensive.

Growing unemployment
severely hits the very young and
very old. Countless numbers of
older people are losing jobs
steadily. Along with their lost
jobs they often lose their private
pension rights. Support from re-
latives becomes more- difficult
as unemployment grows.

U. S. CAN AFFORD IT

Older people do not ask for
charity. Far poorer nations than
ours serve their elders better
than we do,

Soon the national output of
goods and services in the United
States may hit the $600 billion
mark, yet the ‘AMA and big
business spokesmen insist we
cannot afford to provide mini-
mal health care for the aging.

Old-age health care financed
through national pooling of re-
sources would tax each of us
less than the cost of a pack of
cigarettes a week.

A MAJOR PROBLEM

Stories are told of how older
people must suffer -in this
wealthy nation—not only physi-

  

cally, but psychologically, forced
into positions of begging, of in-
dignity. The Senate Sub-Com-
mittee on Aging recently showed
that for the majority, old age
is a time of deprivation, anxiety,
and often needless suffering.

“A major problem for millions
of older persons throughout the
nation is how to maintain a de-
cent, -independent A m e ri c a 11
standard of living on an income
below or barely at the subsis-

tance level,” the Sub-Committee’

reported.

“At least half the aged can-
not afford decent housing, proper
nutrition,
care, preventive or acute, or
necessary recreation,” it said.

FACTS ‘FOR THOUGHT

Here are some facts to con-
sider: .

0 Sixty per cent of aged indi-
viduals had money incomes of
less than $1,000. Another 20 per-
cent had incomes between $1,000
and $2,000.

0 Two of every five aged citi-
zens in America were unable in
1959 to gather $200 in liquid as-
sets in order to cover emergency
costs.

The American Medical Associ-
ation has stepped up its money-
heavy campaign to muddy the
waters. _

AMA DISTORTIONS '

-Rep‘. Cecil R. King, co-sponsor
of the Anderson—King bill, re-
cently stated the AMA is guilty
of “lies and deception” in its na-
tion-wide newspaper advertising
aimed at destroying public con-
fidence in the legislation.

He called it a “coldly calcu-

lated campaign of dishonesty to

discredit my bill . . . The AMA
is spending millions of dollars
to defeat the bill which will help
millions of older people pay
their hospital bills . . . I do ob-
ject to lies, distortions, half-
truths and misrepresentations
being heaped upon my bill.”

Some of the noteworthy dis-
tortions mentioned by King in-
clude the AMA’s statement there
is no “freedom of choice.” The
fact is that any hospital that
meets health and safety stand-
ards can be chosen.

The AMA claims the bill “is
not realistic — nine m illio 11
Americans over 65 already have
some form of health insurance.”

This is the biggest distortion

crx./\/\/\/~

 

adequate in e d i c a 1.

 

  

 

of them all, King claims. In
fact, about the same number do
not have any form of health in-
surance whatsoever. In addition,
the vast majority of those who
do have health insurance are not
adequately protected.
more, insurance premiums for
those over 65 are excessively
high, and an increasing number
cannot afford to pay these costs.

When the AMA’s spokesmen
are at a loss for anything else
to say, they can be depended on
to scream “socialized medicine.”

TIMES HAVE CHANGED

Back in 1957 when Rep. Aime
J. Forand, a Democrat from
Rhode Island, was working for
similar liberal social legislation
to help the aged pay hospitaliza-
tion and nursing care, the “For-
and bill” was vigorously at-
tacked and destroyed.

Forand has since organized
the National Council of Senior
Citizens which sponsored the
May 20 rallies behind the Ander-
son—King bill.

Now, for the first time, it
looks as if there is a brighter
chance for this kind of legisla-
tion. Public demand may assure
passage of the Administration’s
bill. Labor has launched one of
its greatest positive campaigns
in its history behind the bill.

Many Republicans are intro-
ducing health care bills that are
less adequate, but seem to be
aimed at getting in on the popu-
lar demands.

INDUSTRY Notes

LEAD-ZINC production in Western Colorado will get a boost .
with the planned reopening of the Silverton, Colo., mill of Standard
Metals Corporation. The mill will start on ore stockpiled during
the one and one-half million dollar extension of the American Tun-
nel at the company’s mine.

Directors of the company hope they can at least make expenses
if there are no further cuts in already low lead and zinc prices.

CADMIUM PRICES have edged up again since the recent climb
in cadmium was noted in this column in last April’s issue.

The National Association of Metal Finishers, representing users
of cadmium for corrosion-resistant plating of automotive, aircraft,
radio and TV parts, and nuts and bolts, are unhappy about the
price hike and the disappearance of discounting among cadmium
sellers.

The association has written to the Subcommittee on National
Stockpiles of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It pointed out

THE MINE-MILL union

 

 Judy Bond, 
; Colgate on
‘Unfair’ Lists

NEW YORK, N. Y.—The In-
ternational Ladies’ Garment
_Workers Union is calling on all
trade unions and women’s auxil-
iaries to place Judy Bond
Blouses on their “unfair” lists

because of the company’s re-.

fusal to bargain.

The ILGWU struck the blouse
firm last Jan. 9 when manage-
ment, in the midst of negotia-
tions, locked out its New York
workers, refused to bargain and
became a “run-away” leaving
many old employees jobless.
The strike has spread to other
plants and the ILGWU is con-
ducting a nation-wide “Don’t
Buy Judy Bond Blouses” cam-
paign.

Union picketing continued at
the struck firm’s showrooms in
New York City, Los Angeles
and Atlanta.

BERKELEY, Calif.—The strike
of International Longshore-
men’s & Warehousemenfs, Union
Local 6 against Colgate-Palm-
olive Company here continued
-in its ninth month after the un-
ion’s members unanimously re-
jected the company’s most ‘re-
cent take-it-or-leave-it offer and
vowed to stay out as long as
necessary to “win a contract
settlement comparable with the
area pattern.

The union has been conduct-
ing a national boycott campaign
on Colgate-Palmolive products
since the strike began last Sept.
15. "

Among the struck products on
the “unfair” list are the de-
tergents FAB, VEL and AD;
Palmolive and Cashmere.Bo-
quet soaps; Halo and Lustre
Creme shampoos; Colgate Den-
tal Cream; Palmolive Rapid
Shave; Wildroot Creme Oil; and

Peretti, Great ._
Falls Oldtimer,

Passes Away

GREAT FALLS, Mont.—Mar-
co Peretti, one of the real old-
timers in Great Falls Mill &
Smeltermen’s Union Local '16,
passed away here April 9.

~Known to all workers, he was
one of the most colorful men at
the smelter.

Marco’s life was a picture of
strength, loyalty and independ-
ence. He was born_ in Turin,
Italy, July 26, 1882, and came to
the U. S. alone at an early age.
He worked in the Butte mines
for a nuinber of years, in the
coal mines at Stockett and San
Coulee, Mont., and then for the
Anaconda Company until his re-
tirement at the age of 68.

‘ He was married in 1918 and
raised five children. Mrs. Per-
etti died in 1942.

Brother Peretti was a good,
loyal union man and had many
friends in the community. Many
oldtime members of Logal 16
and other friends attended his
funeral. '

Mine-Mill President John
Clark, who knew Marco well as
a union man and friend, acted
as a pall bearer at the funeral.

Clark said: “One by one these
old leaders ‘and fighters who
helped build this great union are
passing away. They leave be-
hind something we should cher-
ish and fight for as did Marco
Peretti.”
