The.Los.Angeles Committee for Defense of the Bill of Rights
is calling upon all Americans to come to the defense of Angela Davis.
The Justice Department, the FBI, at the behest of the Nixon Admin-
istration, as part of carrying thru their war and racist policies,
have made a victim of Angela Davis.

The reprehensible actions of the FBI in placing the
name of this sterling fighter for freedom on the Ten Most Wanted
List precluded her ever getting a fair trial in the racist courts
of this country. And at her arraignment the exorbitant bail -

(a quarter of a million dollars) is in effect a denial of bail
and an effort to inflame further public opinion against her.

We submit that this attack upon a militant member of
the Black Community is an effort to intimidate that comunity
and to stifle its great efforts for freedom.

It is ironic, indeed, that the public officials in
San Diego - the mayor, the city councilmen, etc. - who were in-
dicted by the Grand Jury of San Diego for stealing peoples‘ money
were allowed free on their own recognizance and that Governor Reagan
stated in commenting on this crime that, "Under our jurisprudence
everyone is innocent until proven gui1ty.l For Angela Davis, this
is impossible under the racist standard of justice practiced against
the Black citizens in this country.

WRITE, WIRE, CALL TO ATTORNEY GENERAL MITCHELL TO RELEASE

ANGELA DAVIS ON HER OWN RECOGNIZANCE.
