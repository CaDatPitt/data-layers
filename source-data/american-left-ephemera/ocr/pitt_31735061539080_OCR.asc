Miners Union, which had been borniout of the rank and

ﬁle “Save-the-Union” movement in the United Mine;-1
. Workers of America, also grew rapidly, through the ‘
struggles it led, especially in ;Western Pennsylvania, East
Ohio and ’Northern West Virginia. It led the famous
I strike of 4o,0oo’miners in the Penn-Ohio-West Virginia ’ 

ﬁelds in 1931, and the big Kentucky strike of early 1932.

Soon new unions were formed, in industries where the 0 
bulk of the workers were left’ unorganized by the A.  up 
of L. The Marine Workers Industrial Union was ‘formed

in 1930. Contrary to the craft policy of the A. F. of L.

in the marine industry, it united the seamen and the long-. 

shoremen in one’ militant indu,strial'union. The National

Textile Workers Union was formed, born in struggles_
likethat of New Bedford in 1928, involving 15,000, and 0
those of the Gastonia cotton mill workers and other s.0uth- L
ern strikes. Before it was many months old it_was playing '

the leading part in a strike of 25,000 Lawrence woolen
mill workers for better wages. Soon after it led a series

of strikes‘ in the Rhode Island silk mills, especially in

Pawtucket and Central Falls. It won many gains for
these workers.

{The Steel and" Metal Workers Industrial Union soon,;7
joined the militant band of “industrial unions, It grew, I
out of the Metal Workers Industrial Leagiie. It took
hard, day by day work, real plugging, before the new I
‘steel and metal union could lead big strikes of the steel
and metal workers. We shall see later how the Steel and 
Metal” Workers Industrial Union was the ﬁrst union since,
I919 to break into the Steel Trust company towns and

8 M -

 

  

 

lead the steel workers in big struggles. The Auto Workers
Union grew in struggles. such as that in the Fisher
Body strikein Flint, the Briggs strike of February 1933,
and the Ford Hunger March. '
Other militant industrial unions were formed, until
there were T.U.U.L. unions (besides those already men-
tioned) in food, packing house, shoe and leather, furni-
ture, agricultural, ofﬁce, ﬁshermen and cannery, lumber,

in addition to smaller unions in many other industries,"

and groups in industries like railroad, rubber, etc., which
are the nuclei of future militant unions. In the -Chapter
called .“The Trade Union Unity League Today” we shall
see what struggles the T.U.U.L. has led in the recent
period, and what its membership is. y - '

Chapter‘ III
POLICIES AND STRUCTURE OF THE T.U.U.L.
Class Against Class

As we have shown in the ﬁrst chapter, the basic policy

of the Trade Union Unity League is that of class strug-

gle, militant struggle to win the economic demands of
the workers. Its policy isvthe direct opposite of the class
collaboration policy of the A. F. of‘ L. and other reformist
union leaders, who try to fool the workers into believing
that the workers and the capitalists have common in-

terests, are “partners in industry,” and should always -

work together. The Trade Union Unity League says

that the ruling class and the toiling‘ masses have nothing .

in common; that they are irreconcilable enemies—the
capitalists who make millions and the workers from whom
. 9 _

 

  "~ they ‘make their millions by reducing the workers’ 

I The lower organs of the T.U..U.L., the shop organs, are

 j democratic ‘body. In most cases the work must be done: 9 9
, illegally, that is, care must be taken not to expose them 

 

ditions and wages to the starvation level. i A t
The Trade Union“ Unity League and the industrial
unions afﬁliated to it organize all sections of the working p ,
“class, the especially exploited Negroes, the women, the'V‘s.».
youth; the iunskilledas well as the skilled; the foreign?
A born worker side by side with the native worker. The p
TA. F. of L. splits the ‘workers through craft unionism——f

divisioniof workers in one industry into many trades, so
that there is no unity “between all the workers in one in-, ‘l 

strike. Thevall-inclusive militant industrial unionism of 

, the Trade Union Unity League insures the unity of all
workers ina factory, mine or industry. L

‘ Based on the Factory. Mill or Mine \ i_ ,

._ The unions of the Trade Union Unity League. base 
themselves_directly on the factory, shop, mill or ‘mine. -

the basic sections of the militant, industrial unions. When» 
-a militant, industrial union ﬁrst undertakes to organize
.the workers in a factory, or mine, as the case may be,- fr’ '1
the most elementary, primitive form of organization is ’
the grievance committee. Here we are in the initial stage,
where we are forming the embryo of the future shop
committee. The shop committee is elected by all workers
in the shop, regardless of politics or craft, or union 7‘ W
afﬁliation. It is thus seen how the shop committee is  if

dustry, so that one craft in a ‘factory will remain at work“   ‘
whileanother strikes, thus making itieasy to break the  

 
 
 
  
 
  
   
   
  
  
      

 

   

 _,..-,. existfor this purpose, and in addition, for the purpose of ‘

making it easier to keep in close touch with the daily

 
 

p grievances and problems that arise in each department of I
the shop. The grievance or the shop committee is a dele-

it gate body of the department committees. This is how the

militant, industrial union carries out its day to day ’work
right in the shop, and in the closest touch with every-

«thing that goes on in every section of the shop.
The shop committee leaders never settle questions by; .

themselves, from the top, so to speak, but the workers
decide.

The shop delegate system exists on the basis of dele- I

gates ‘from each shop committee to the union in the

locality. Thus the direct line of ‘democratic control, from "I
' the workers in the department committees, to their rep-

resentatives in the shop committees, and then to the shop
delegates to the union, is seen. '

The Relation Between the T.U.U.L. and the
National Industrial Unions
The T.U.U.L. is made up of the affiliation of the Na-
tional Industrial Unions, and local industrial unions which
as yet have no national aﬂiliation. The National Board
of the T.U.U.L. is composed of representatives of these

unions. The T.U.U.L. advises the National Industrial I

Unions; it aids them by‘ directives which are the result
of the collective experiences of all the unions; it unites
all the National Industrial Unions in support of the

pi struggles bf‘ any of these unions. The T.U.U.L. does
not dictate to the National Industrial Unions, but it is the

workers who are members of these unions who decide on

' ’policies and actions.

‘ demonstrative actions against imperialist v\}'a,r,j*~

   

policy is to build the anti—war base in the factories, es—.
pecially in those industries which are war industries. ‘ i
The T.U.U.L. supports the struggles of the workers
and peasants of the colonial and semi—colonial countries,
as in Latin-America, China, India, etc. The same capi-
'  talists who exploitthe colonial workers exploit the'Amer.-
ican workers. ' T
E9 The T.U.U.L. takes a leading part in the struggle p
against international fascism as well as against fascism 
in America. Its unions have been in the forefront of the it
 campaign of support to the victims of the Hitler terror in
 Germany. ' ‘A
' The Trade Union Unity League is not a political .or- ii
. ganization. It leads the economic struggles of the work-
ers. But it is based on the policy of class against class,
and T.U.U.L. unions have come out in support of‘ the
revolutionary political class struggles led by the Com-
munist Party, because this Party believes in the class
struggle. The -Communist candidates in elections always
have run’ on a platform based on the class interests of
the toiling masses; they have always raised. the economic
as well as political demands of the toiling masses. The -
T.U.U.L. unions could not ﬁnd it possible to endorse the 
Republican and Democratic Parties, because they are out-
rightly and openly supported, ﬁnancially and otherwise,
by the capitalists who reduce the workers to starvation.
The Socialist, Farmer—Labor and other reformist parties
base themselves on the same class-collaboration policies
as the A. F. of L. and other reformist trade union officials.
. Therefore the revolutionary workers have urged the rank
and ﬁle in the T.U.U.L. unions, as well as in other
unions, to support the Communist Party in its campaigns,

13

,7:  ,;:$7,""‘:,‘,.,

 

 

 

  

 

 

 
   

and the rank and ﬁle within. the  unions have been  it   ~~

A" . , quick to see the reason for this. Of course, nomernbers of

T.U_.U.L. unions are compelled, by virtue of belonging to

a T.U.U.L. union, to endorse the Communist Party or

any party. T
iTl1e‘T.Ui.U.L. rejects the proposals for the formation

ofla Labor- Party, which would“ be only another capitalist
. party. _ ’

The T.U.U.L. points out to, the workers the disaster

of the capitalists owning the industries and operating them H

for their own proﬁts. It leads the workers for their eco-

nomic demands, but points out to them that only by the »
overthrow of the capitalist system of exploitation of the

workers and by the establishment of a system, where
production will be carried on not for private proﬁt but
for the social good, will the American workers, and
workers in all capitalist‘ countries, completely and ﬁnally
free themselves from low wages, unemployment, long

hours, the speed-up, lowering of conditions in all ways,

and war. In Germany and Austria, the futility of ‘trying
to overthrow the system of exploitation of the workers

tmerely through parliamentary means has been shown.

The T.U.U.L. and the A. F. of L. Workers

The T.U.U.L. and its afﬁliated unions do not regard
themselves as enemies of the workers who are in the
American Federation of Labor and other reformist unions.

These workers are members of the same class as the 

workers in the revolutionary unions. Their interests are

‘one. The T.U.U.L. members believe that they and the
“ Ag’ F. of L. members should ﬁght side by side, in the

the interests of the workers and in the interests of the

Afpgmployers, the Trade Union Unity League gives guidance  T
H  to militant opposition groups within the A. F. of’ L. and 
 “other ‘reformist unions. This is not to‘ disrupt theseg

unions, not to break them up, but to help the rank and
tilein taking over control of. these unions, in transforming
their unions into organizations which ﬁght only for the

interests of the workers. In this ‘way can the rank and

altion for Negroes. It makes relentless war against lynch-

of white workers‘ against Negroes. ‘T he T.U.U.L. de- .' 
_ mands the fullest participation and leadership of Negro ; L V
— workers in allgorganizations and movements of the ‘work-
_ ing class.- It exposes the systematic betrayal of the

Negroes by the fascist and social-fascist labor leaders. 7
The T.U.U.L. organizes Negroes into the new in-'
dustrial unionsgwith the white workers on the basis of

it i‘ - the fullest equality. In the old unions, it combats all dis- _.

criminatory practices aimed against Negroes. It demands
and ﬁghts for the admission of Negroes into these
unions. The T. U. U. L. Negro Department connects
up the ﬁght of the Negro workers in this country with"

x the worldwide struggle of the Negro race through the

International Negro Labor Bureau. The T.U.U.L. en-

a dorses and supports the general work of the League of 3
‘Struggle for Negro Rights. ‘ ' i '

% For the Organization otithe Youth
The young. workers are playing an increasingly im-
portant role in industry and in the struggles of the.

' working class. They are the strategic factor in‘ capitalist

war‘ preparations and are being systematically militarized
upon a gigantic scale. The A. F. of L. leaders, conform-
ing as usual to the general line of policy of the employers,

‘ have grossly discriminated against the youth, barring _ '-
' them from the unions and refusing to ﬁght against the
.spécial abuses to which they are subjected. They have
A . allowed unhampered the employers to militarize the youth

through the C.M.T.C.’s etc., to poisogin it through company

sports, and to generally cripple it ideologically.

 
 

The T.U.U.L. rejects this whole line of the social 

reformistsand puts in the forefront of its program the
organization of the youth and the advancement of its

interests. The T.U.U.L. has a National Youth Depart- '

ment and establishes youth sections nationally and locally
in its aﬂiliated unions. It raises special youth demands,
for the 6-hour working day and 5-day week, equal pay
for equal work, abolition of night work, abolition of child

s. labor, establishment of vacations, minimum wages, ap-

prenticeship regulations, rest periods, etc. It furthers
anti-military work amongst the youth and supports the
proletarian sport organization, the Labor Sports Union.

For the Struggle of the Women Workers

With the simpliﬁcation and mechanization of the in-

dustrial process, women are being brought into the in-

 

dustries in huge and increasing numbers. They are sub-
jected to the ﬁercest speed-up and compelled to work for
wages 25 per cent to 40 per cent lower than male workers
at similar occupations. They are an important factor in
the military mobilization plans of American imperialism.

» The T.U.U.L. works to unite the women workers for a M"
’ joint striiggle with the workers generally. It maps out

programs of demands for them, embodying equal pay for
equal work, general raising of women workers’ wages,
establishment of‘ a 7-hour day and 5-day week, with a
6-hour day for harmful and strenuous ‘occupations, and
a full month holiday annually with full pay; for the
elimination of night work and overtime and work in
harmful occupations; protection during child-birth

18

 

 

 

 

 

 

periods; installment of proper sanitary regulations; pro-
tection by social insurance against unemployment, old age,

' sickness, etc. To further these programs the T.U.U.L. -

has a National Women’s. Department, establishes women’s

— commissions in the unions, and develops periodic trade

union conferences for women workers. The winning of
the women workers for the class struggle is a major ob

jective of the T.U.U.L. ' r ' _“

TheiT.U.U.L. and the Unemployed Workers

The struggles of the unemployed for relief and for’

unemployment insurance at the expense of the bosses
and the government are inseparable ‘from the struggles
of the employed workers. The ﬁghtiof the 17,000,000
and more unemployed is the ﬁght of the employed work-
ers. The revolutionary unions take a leading position in
the struggle for adequate relief for the unemployed; and

for the Workers’ Unemployment Insurance Bill, which

the T.U.U.L. fully endorses. The Unemployment Coun-
cils receive the fullest co-operation of the T.U.U.L. The
unemployed members of the revolutionary unions func-
tion in unemployed branches of‘ the unions, and these are

the weapons of the revolutionary unions in ﬁghting for‘

the demands of the unemployed members.

Chapter IV V

THE RECENT STRUHGGLES LED BY THE T.U.U.L. . 

Recently the striking miners of the Gallup ﬁeld in New
Mexico won a startling victory under the leadership of
the National Miners Union. After a long struggle,

' marked with the most brutal terror on the part of the

local and state governments, _the coal operators gave in
toeight of the eleven demands of the strikers, including
the release of all miners and their leaders arrested during
the strike. ,

The Gallup victory" was one of the highlights in the
great strike wave which accompanied the N .R.A., and
which saw over a million workers engaged in strikes from
July 1, 1933, to the end of December of that year. What
part did the unions affiliated with the Trade Union Unity
League play in that strike wave? . ' ’

gThe T.U.U.L. in Steel

The Steel and Metal Workers Industrial Union led the
ﬁrst major strikes in the steel industry since the great
1919 steel strike. , While the A. F. of L. paid no attention
since I919 to any but the most skilled steel workers, the
S.M.W.I.U. went into the closed company towns, and
worked slowly but surely to ‘build up organization in the
mills. It electriﬁed the steel workers by leading ‘500 work-
ers of the Pressed Steel Car Company on strike, in the
closed town of McKees Rocks, Pa. The S~.M.W.I.U.

The T.U.U_.L. Exposed N.R.A.
While the A. F. of L. helped put over the N.R.A.

_ _ codes, which generally lowered wages by establishing‘
. 1 eminimum wages which became ___the maximum,,whi1e the
« A. F. of L. slavishly cooperated with the Roosevelt Ad-

ministration in crushing all struggles of the workers, the
revolutionary unions exposed and fought the bosses’
codes, and sent delegations to the Washington code hear-

ings, where they submitted workers’ codes calling for
v« real wage increases, for the unqualiﬁed right to strike,
and the right to join any unions, including the revolu- .

The A.  of L. Leaders in Action

Let us look at strike number two. Same industry,
same town. The workers here have the same problems as
those inthe first strike. But this strike has not been pre-

~

pared. It may have happened that an official of a certain ~

union, a man who gets a salary of ﬁve or six thousand
dollars a year has come in to “organize the workers”=—at
so much initiation per worker. The Workers are so sorely
oppressed, have had their conditions and wages attacked
so often that they are crying for organization. They Want
to ﬁght——to strike. But there will be no strike, if the

“organizer” can help it. He gives them honeyed words _

—“wait a little while”, “let’s cooperate with the Presi-
dent”, “Let’s do a little negotiating”. Behind the scenes

. the organizer can be found spending more time in the

company’s ofﬁce than with the workers the is “organiz-
ing.” p ' ‘

But the temper of the Workers is high: Reluctantly, a
hasty council of the ofﬁcials decides to call a strike. But

they plan to knife the strike at the ﬁrst opportunity.‘

They discourage any. mass action. Picketing is limited to
a few. Every effort is made to cater to the wishes of the
police, the authorities, the bosses. The workers have no

_voice in the conduct of the strike. If they get “out of

hand”—- if they resort to militant action, investigationvwill
ﬁnd their “leaders” cooperating with the authorities. One
ﬁne morning the workers read in the paper that the strike
has been called off. They had no say in running the
strike, they have no say in the way it ends. This is typical

 facturers. 9 , . V 
Rationalization of industry———speedup and eﬁ‘iciency'x ‘ ii

methods-l—were bringing the conditions of the American

 

workers lower and lower. Then came the economic crisis,

F of capitalism, the brunt of which the workers have beeng _ " L  it

forced to bear. It brought attack after attack on the 

workers—wage‘ cut after wage cut; the stagger plan,
mass layoffs, resulting in unemployment which has

‘ reached the gigantic proportions of 17,000,000.

The A. F. of L. oiﬁcialdom lost no time in showing

 

where their interests lay."One of their very ﬁrst acts after . 0‘

the Wall Street crash of 1929 was the infamous Hoover-
Green “no strike-no wage cut agreement”. Needless. to
say, the employers did not keep the “no wage cut” part

F of the agreement. But for four years, until mass pressure 

forced them to call strike struggles in some cases, the A.
F. of L. leaders kept the workers hog-tied.

The radica1ization—the ﬁghting spirit—~—of the workers
began to develop and grow. 1931 and 1932 saw great

 

strikes of the coal miners, textile workers, auto workers;    L‘ H

and workers in other industries- The A. F. of L. would

not lead them; "to whom could the workers turn forthe  

militant leadership they wanted? “ .
V The T.U.U.L. Is Formed
The Trade Union Unity League had been organized in

 

Cleveland, on August 3I,_ 1929. It was a reorganization, ‘ 
and expansion of the old Trade Union Educational F

League, which had existed since November, ‘I920, mainly

organizing revolutionary minorities, or opposition groups, 

 

.‘   

 

  within the conservative trade unions.) Fight after ﬁght of _
 _the rank and ﬁle had been led by the T.U.E.L., within
1 the A. F. of L. and the Railroad Brotherhoods, against
the class collaboration policies of the oﬁicialdom, against»

 

the treacheries, against racketeering and the host of other

evils‘ _which form part and parcel of‘ the rule of the

Greens, the Wells, the Lewises, and the McGradys.
But the time had come when the needs of the workers

T demanded a new unionism. There were the seventeen or .

more millions of unorganized workers, looking. for or-
ganizational leadership. There were the tens of thousands
of militant workers who had been expelled byrthe ma-

chines of the various unions of the A. F. of L. and other

conservative unions. .

_ The new Trade Union Center—the Trade Union Unityt ,

League——was formed with the main task of organizing
the unorganized into industrial, independent unions. This
did not and does not mean that the workers who are

i to members of the conservative unions were to be aban- '

doned, left to the tender mercies of the strikebreaking,

' F ’ racketeering A. F. of L. olﬁcialdom. The task of’ organiz-

ing the workers within the A. F. of L., for militant
struggle, against class collaboration, against racketeering,
did not become less with the organization of the T.U.U.L.,

‘butt on the contrary, looms larger than ever.
