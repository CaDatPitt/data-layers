the law, each man is entitled. Instead, there
is . . . a pillorying of individuals not ac-
cused of crimes.” (34) ‘
That description perfectly ﬁts the Un-Ameri-
can Activities Committee.

In ractice, any "evidence” at all, whether
forged, erjured or psychopathic, is good
enough or this "pillorying” technique. In-
dividuals are put to death economically by
smearing them in headlines, then pressuring
their em loyers to ﬁre them, their associates
to ostracize them, their clients and patients
and customers to abandon them on pain of
being smeared themselves. Liberal organiza-
tions and publications are destroyed by ub-
licly listing them as "Communist" or " om-
munist fronts” and jailing their ofﬁcers if
possible (as in the case of the Joint Anti-
Fascist Refugee Committee). These "subvers-
iue” lists contain "more than a thousand”
organizations and "something lihe a million”
individuals (35) ——which is all the proof
needed that the Committee is not reall after
Communist organizations but rather is ound-
ing the progressive media through which the
people express their will.

Like “cunning old Fury" in the poem, the
Committee has constituted itself not only the
judge and jury but also the prosecutor and
hangman of all progressive, hopeful tenden-
cies in American life.

To all objections concerning his methods,
Martin Dies, founder of the Committee, cyn-
ically replied:

"If you . . . require an! committee to prove
he and a reasonable ouht that a man is

su versive. . .you could never accomplish
anything.” (Emphasis supplied.)

“W12 ARE . IMPERILLED"

"If there is any principle of the Con-
stitution that more imperatively calls
for attachment than any other it is the
principle of free thought—not ree
thou ht for those who agree wit us
but ﬁreedom for the thought that we
hate.”— JUSTICE OLIVER WENDELL
HOLMES. (36)

Congressional investigating committees are
created under the theory that Congress, in
order to legislate intelligently in any field,
must be enabled to dig out the facts. It has
been long established, however, that Con-
gress may not investigate any ﬁeld in which
it is forbidden to legislate. Such a ﬁeld is that
exactly deﬁned by the First Amendment.

By numerous court decisions the ‘First
Amendment has been held to guarantee:

Freedom of belief, religious and po-
litical.

Freedom of association, personal and
public, including membership in
churches, political parties, etc.

Freedom to petition for or against
any matter 0 public interest.

Freedom of thought, including free-
dom from oompulsion to utter or
confess thought.

Freedom of speech, including free-
dom to be silent; including all forms
of communication, press, radio,
screen, etc.; whether for or against
any system of economy or govern-
ment.

These freedoms are subject only to certain
speciﬁc restrictions such as are covered by
t e laws of libel or conspiracy, or by the
circumstance of a “clear and present dan-
ger.” The classic example of this is, that one
is not free to cry "Fire!” in a crowded
theatre.

It was clear to constitutional authorities
that a Congressional Committee like the un-
Americans could not legislate, hence could
not investigate, in a ﬁeld of communication
such as “propaganda” without violating the
Constitution. In order to accomplish its sub-
versive purpose, it had to circumvent or an-
nul the First Amendment.

This it did by projecting a theory that the
Communist Party was not truly a political
party but a foreign-dominated "conspiracy”
to “overthrow” the "American form" of gov-
ernment by "force and violence," (37) and
therefore that the "Communist movement"
(by which the Committee dearl meant any
progressive individual or organization) was
not under the protection of the First Amend-
ment. In taking this line the Committee was
following a pattern as old as reaction itself.
As Attorney Charles J. Katz made clear, the
charge of “conspiracy” against Communists
today

"is exactly what Marcus Aurelius said about
the Christians, and that is exactly what the
followers of King Henry VIII said about
the Catholics, and that is exactly, word for
word, what certain people said about Anne
Hutchinson. Eve time you ﬁnd an in-
guisition, you ﬁn someone trying to justify
it by saying, ‘We are imperilled. ” (38)

“Tun Dnm~xmoN or
Dnsporxc GOVERNMENT"

”I charge this committee with contrib-
uting to the buildup of a Big Lie in
this country with respect to the alleged
menace of Communism for the purpose
of rushin the American people into
war whic the do not want and which
can only result in the destruction of
this country and its institutions.”-—
ArT’Y JOHN W. PORTER. (39)

Regardless how much you may dislike the
Communists or their rogram, the fact is
that the un-Americans have never substanti-
ated their allegation of an international Com-
munist conspiracy of violence. The Com-

,mittee has spent 15 years investigating

Communism; it has iled u tens of
thousands of pages, millions 0 words of
testimony; yet to this da it has not un-
covered a single act of orce or violence
or attempt to overthrow the government.

Indeed, the testimony of its own inform-
ers ﬂatly and repeatedly contradicts the 0&-
cial Committee cartoon of the Red Menace.
Consider the following sample:

"The Communist Party was honestly con-
cerned with the question of peace . . . hon-
estly believed that the danger to peace
comes from the United States . . . since the
atom bomb was the United States’ weapon
primarily—certainly at that time [1946-
47]." (40)

There has indeed been force and violence
in Los Angeles. In Chapter I we instanced
the bombing of Negro homes and the sadistic
police brutality against Mexicans. And there

as been force and violence elsewhere in the
land —— e. g., the killing of Mr. Harry Moore,
representative of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, and
his wife, by the bombing of their Florida
home; the anti-Negro riots in Cicero, Ill., etc.

But the Committee has never bothered
to investigate such atrocities.

In fact, when one witness demanded of
Rep. Jadcson what he had done to investi-
gate the bombings on Dunsmuir Ave., Los

"Labor unions and other liberal or-'
ganizations have been harassed and
their legitimate activities int cred
with by this committee with the sole
brown purpose of ' g the enemies
of Iabor.”—-Pump Mummy.

An es, the California Congressman con-
fessgeed that he had done no more than
a statement deploring the outrage. He com-
lained that "it is not possible for me to run
ome” to California at "every traﬂic acci-
dent." (41) -

As for the Committee pretense that we are

faced with a "clear and present dan r" of V

subversion, the witnesses exposed e hol-
lowness of the allegation. Most of them had
been subpoenaed, waiting to testify, eleven
months before. If there was truly an immi-
nent dan er, -they asked, why had the Com-
mittee delayed a year before even questioning
them? (42)

Since therewas no conspiracy, no force or
violence, no clear and present danger, there-
fore:

"Any legislation that might result from the
activities of this committee. . . necessarily
would be unconstitutional.”— A'rr'Y WM.
M. SAMUELS. (43)
Both the McCarran Act of 1950, and the
earlier Smith Act under which Communist
leaders are being prosecuted and jailed by
the dozens, are prime examples of legisla-
tion that, in any but a period of panic, would
be promptly thrown out as unconstitutional.
They are laws that make crimes out of
thou hts in order to punish certain peo-
ple. ey rest heavily on the fanciful the-
ory of conspiracy, unsu ported by fact.

A prime objective of e un-Americans —
to nullify the First Amendment— was at-
tained when the Supreme Court, yielding to
cold-war administration pressure, upheld the
Smith Act as "constitutional” by a 6-to-2
decision. (44)

In dissenting. from this shameful Dred
Scott Decision of our day, Justice Black said:

"These petitioners were not charged
with an attem t to overthrow the
government. T ey were not charged
with non-verbal acts of any kind. . ..
They were not even charged with
saying anything or writin anything
designed to overthrow t e govern-
ment . . . [The indictment] is a viru-
lent orm of prior censorship of
s eec and press, which I believe
t e First Amendment forbids.”

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch commented
on the decision: _
"Six men have amended the U.S. Constitu-

tion without submitti their amendment
tothestatesforratiﬁca on.'I'hatisthenub
of this decision." -

Today cunning old Fury has usurped the
powers of all three branches of government.
As Judge Henry White Edgerton pointed
out in his dissent in the Barsky case:

"The Committee inﬂicts punishment for un-
orthodox opinions or associations without
any of these safeguards [of a court trial]."
(45)
It thus encroaches on the courts. By investi-
gating in areas where it cannot legislate it
steals the powers of the executive. The fact
that its members have been elected to oﬂice
is no excuse for their overthrowing the
ancient American doctrine of separation of
powers in our form of government. As
homas Jefferson said in 1782:
“The concentration of all the powers of
government, legislative and executive and
judicia , in the same hands, is precisely

the )de nition of a despotic government.”
(46

BLACKLIST: “A CONSPIRACY
WITHOUT WARRANT or LAW”

"No person may be deprived of life,
liberty or property witbout due Process
:7 law, and I maintain tbat I am being

eprived of tbe most serious, tbe most
basic property of my life—-my rigbt
to work —— by tbe un-American black-
list . . . to wbicb tbis Committee bas di-
rectly contributed, wbicb tbis Commit-
tee bas never repudiated.”— Testimony
of actor HERMAN WALDMAN, sup-
pressed by tbe Un-American Commit-
tee. (47)

Blacklist became a principal weapon of
the Committee as early as January 6, 1941,
when Committeeman J. Parnell Thomas boast-
ed to big-business employers in a speech:

"There is material of vast value to Man-
agement in the ﬁles of the Dies Committee.
We have the names of thousands of men
whom we have reason to suspect because

of their connections, past or present. . . .
These ﬁles are available to you.” (48)

By 1947 the Committee's counsel was pres-
suring frightened movie producers in the
witness chair:

"Don't you think the most effective way
of removing these Communist inﬂuences is
the payroll route? In other words, if the
owners and producers cut these people off
the payroll . . . ? (49)

Film “producers did at ﬁrst resist a black-
list. Pa V. McNutt, then attorney for the
Motion Picture Association of America, de-
dared:

"Tbere bas been a suggestion that tbe
Motion Picture Association ado t a
policy of blacblistin . That wou d be

a conspiracy wit out warrant of
law.” (Emphasis supplied) (50)

Two days earlier Eric Johnston, President of
the Association, had pledged that:

"As long as I live I will never be a
party to anything so un-American
as a blacklist.” (51)

Alas, poor Eric! Barely a month later,
(52) summoned into secret conference in
New York by his ﬁnancial overseers, he was
forced to swallow his words and publicly
announce a ﬁlm industry blacklist against
any employee who dared resist the un-Amer-
scans.

Commented Committee Chairman J. Par-
nell Thomas:
"This is indeed most gratifying."
(Less than a year later Thomas was indicted
for stealing from the government; he was
duly convicted, jailed, aroled and ﬁnally
pardoned by President ruman; is now at
iberty.)
The meaning of blacklist as a settled pol-
icy of the entertainment industry was not
lost on employers or their hirelings. Commit-
tee investigators encouraged employees of
large ambitions and small virtue to “come
forward and confess” their past aﬂiliations
and to protect their jobs by tattling on their
competitors. The employers in turn oblig-

ingly blacklisted those named by the stool-

pigeons. The term "cutthroat competition"
ceased to be an exaggeration and became an
everyday fact of American business practice.

If a stoolpigeon did not name names
enough to satisfy the Committee's appetite
for headlines, he was himself threatene with
blacklist. So competition among informers
reached fantastic proportions. The present
World's Cham ion claimed to remember
knowing more than 150 "Communists" over
a period going back 15 years! In desperation
they improved their scores by naming each
other.*

Blacklist is blackmail, and it ses a seri-
ous moral question: W/bat kin of life can
a community bave wbicb tamel y allows black-
mail to ﬂourisb _and rob citizens of tbeir
rig/at to earn a living?

*"A lady . . . mentioned me, and I can do no less
than mention her."—- Testimony of GEORGE BECK,
Sept. 25, 1951. .

3.   For the Innocent

“The Bill of Rights is not a grant of privilege: handed down to them [the
people] by the government, but rather IT IS A cums AND RESTRICTION LAID
UPON GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE. . . . The Bill of Rights, we must re-
member always, IS AN INSTRUMENT. IT MUST BE WIELDED AND CARED FOR
BY EACH GENERATION.” — ]ames Madison. (Emphasis supplied.)

PRE-FABRICATED CONPUSION

“Our superﬁcial attitude toward the
Bill of Rights is especially shown in
the common confusion about the Fifth
Amendment. There is the current say-
ing, ‘He hid behind the Pi th Amend-
ment,’ implyin that suc an act is
cowardly and egraded. . . . A strange
perversion of terms indeed.”— DR.
EASON MONROE, Exec. Dir., Am. Civil
Liberties Union of So. Calif. (53)

Dr. Monroe has ut his ﬁnger on the most
puzzling aspect of t is un-American skuldug-
gery —— the fact that citizens continually ask:
"Why do witnesses refuse to answer Commit-
tee questions? If they are Communists, why
don’t they admit proudly to their beliefs? If
they're not Communists, why don’t they sim-
ply say they're not?”

The confusion may be common, as Dr.
Monroe says, but it is not natural. It has
been carefully pre-fabricated by the Com-
mitteemen themselves. For years they have
ﬁlled every channel of publicity with repeti-
tions of the falsehood that witnesses who de-
cline to answer questions are ipso facto
"guilty” of something-— ashamed of some-
thing—concealing something. On the con-
trary, as attorney Charles Katz pointed out:

"It is the law that when one invokes the
privilege of the Fifth Amendment he admits
no guilt; that the privile e exists for the
innocent. . . . They hide behind nothing.

They assert their rightsto prevent their de-
struction.” (Emphasis supplied.) (54)

It is only in the Committee’s eyes that you
are guilty until you prove yourself innocent.
“ANYBODY WHO Dons ANswnR”

"To answer that guestion either way, it
seems to me, is ihe asking me when

did I stop beating my wife, and  I
answer I haven’t, it means I am still
heating her.”—- DR. Josnpn HI'l‘TEL-
MAN. (55)

People faced with what un-Americans
have called the $64 question -—"Arc you
now or have you ever been a Communist?”
(56) — are frequently amazed to ﬁnd them-
selves in a typical wife-beating trap. As at-
torney Pauline Epstein mildly remarked in
the course of her testimony,

". . . anybody who does answer a question
concerning Communism is certainly not pro-
tecting himself . .  (57)

Let us consider what happens when you
answer Committee questions: ﬁrst, if you are
one of the 1/25 of 1% in this country who
are Communists; next, if you are not 2. Com-
munist.

If you are and answer Yes, you render
yourself liable to prosecution, a heavy ﬁne,
and long imprisonment under the Smith Act,
even though you do not practice or advocate
and are not even accused of practicing or ad-
vocating force and violence.

A No answer is of course perjury.

So you cannot answer either Yes or No.

It was attorney Rose Rosenberg who told
the Committee: ,

“The Puritans were ‘proud’ of their

faith, and the jews were ‘proud’ too,

and yet when they were faced with
Tor uemada and with Hitler, what
would you have expected, sir? That
they should rise up and say they were
]ews, if the cost of that would be
their heads.’ Today the cost of de-
claring one’s faith . . . is a blacklist,
and a sub oena, and a loyalty oath,
and boole urnings. This has been the
result of the force and violence of
this committee.” (58)

__13_;

Next, suppose you are not a Communist
and‘ answer No.

You are not a bit better oﬁ if you are a
liberal or progressive who works for the
things he believes in, for it is people like
you, not just Communists, whom the Com-
mittee would silence or destroy.

The un-Americans operate throu a sta-
ble of stoolpigeons who will readily paint
their former associates red in exchange
for a job or some other staple valued at thirty

ieces of silver. Stoolpigeons ma lie with
impunity so long as they echo an reinforce
the oﬂicial lies of the Committee; if they are
em loyed, the Committee protects their jobs
wit all the maternal ferocity of a sow with
sucklings. In these days of stiff competition
and overcrowded conditions in the stoolpig-
eon business, it is not diﬁiadt to ﬁnd an in-
former to swear falsely that you are lying.

Attorney 8 encer Austrian expressed his
resentment 0 such a situation when he said:

"I don't know of any reason why I should
put myself in the position of matching my
veracity against any witness that can be dug
up to come before this committee and give
any version that they care to give. . . . If I
say one thing which I regard as the truth,
and it is possible to find in the whole Unit-
ed States any drunhen hum who will testify
to the contrary, I will then be subject to a
test of veracity between that person and my-
self. And knowing the temper of the times,
and the opinions of you gentlemen, I am
sure that I would be required to defend
mfyself, and that would take a great deal
0 energy and a great deal of money, and
while I probably would be vindicated in
the long run (because I have a great deal
of faith in our courts), still why should I
be put in that position?" (Emphasis sup-
plied.) (59)

In America today, unfortunately, people
can be jailed for telling the truth even
though they are innocent of any wrong-
doing. Indeed, according to Leonard B.
Boudin, writing in the Nation:

"The non-Communist may be in greater
danger than the Communist in Congres-
sional inquiries, since a truthful denial of
membership can lead to perjury indictments
with consequences more serious than those
of possible contempt prosecutions." (60)

"We are bound, you and I, and
everyone, to make common cause,
even with, error itself, to maintain the
common right of freedom of con-
science."-—THoMAs JEFFERSON.

 

Suppose you are indicted for perjury for
denying that you are a Communist. In the
current hysteria, whose word do you think
will be accepted as truth by a jury which
fears being accused of disloyalty? Your
word? The word of a witness who was ues-
tioned at a "Red Probe”? Or the word 0 the
“friendly” and "cooperative” stoolpigeon
whom the Committee has publicized as a hero
for having left the Communist Party (where
he claims he saw you 15 years ago) and
helped "save our country from the red men-
ace,” etc., etc.?

Take the Hiss-Chambers case. Hiss went
to jail. Chambers, although a sel -confessed
s , became (a) rich, and (b) e saint of
alflwitch-hunters. A Los Angeles reviewer of
his book compared him to St. Augustine.

Do you think you would come off better
than Hiss?

Still more incredible is the situation of
Owen Lattimore. At his various hearings Mr.
Lattimore has always answered all questions
put to him "frankly and o enly." He has

stated explicitly and repeate y (61) that he '

is not and never has been a Communist, has
never advocated Communism and has no
Communist connections. He has proved in
meticulous detail the "outrageous falsity"
(62) of the "libelous accusations” against
him. He has pitilessly exposed Senator Mc-
Carthy’s methods of slander. (63) He has
virtually psychoanalyzed the sick motives of
stool igeon Budenz (64). He has uncovered
the ehind-the-scenes machinations of the
“millionaire fanatic,” Alfred C. Kohlberg
(McCarthy’s,benefactor) of the China lobby,
whose proﬁtable policy of "all-out aid to
Chiang Kai-shek” (65) had failed—and
for the failure of which he blamed Lattimore.-

Lattimore has done all that a human be-
ing can do to clear himself of insane charges.
He achieved a momentary triumph when the
chairman of the Tydings committee told him
he was

"com letely, up to this moment, at least, in
the c car.” (66)

That was in 1950.

In 1952 Owen Lattimore was indicted by
a grand jury on the charge of perjury in con-
nection with his testimony.

So the witness who is not and never has
been anything but a liberal American will
think twice before he answers ANY inquisi-
torial question.

_;4_

 

No matter what you answer, no matter
if you are or are not a Communist, you risk
a prosecution which may land you in rison,
w ich will certainly cost you plenty o grief,
time and mon , and during the course of
which you will e blacklisted on the assump-
tion that you are "guilty."

Therefore, if ou are to avoid the troubles
brought on by giving truthful answers to un-
Americans, you are compelled to decline to
answer all questions that might tend to link
you with any of the thousands of Ipersons,
organizations or publications ofﬁcia y cited
as "subversive.”

“To PREVENT THEIR DEsTRuc'r1oN”

"There has been an implication voiced
by this committee that in claimin the
privilege under the Fifth Amen ment
a person is doin somethin wrong.
. . . I agree with t e justices o the fe -
eral courts in this land who have stated
that it is the duty of a person to claim
the privilege, in order to prevent ex-
actly what this committee is attempting
to do—that is, to ry into the thoughts
and the beliefs of private citizens/’—
A'rT'v WM. M. SAMUELS. (Emphasis
supplied.) (67)

On what grounds will you base your re-
fusal to answer?

You can't simply tell the Committee that
it's against your principles or your conscience
to turn stoolpi eon or name names; Sidney
Buchman, the lm roducer, tried that, (68)
and he was cited or contempt by a unani-
mous vote of the House of Re resentatives.
You can’t plead, as Larry Parlgs did, (69)
not to be forced to "crawl through the mud
to be an informer. . .I don’t think this is
American justice”; in the end Larry Parks
crawled through the mud in preference to
going to jail and being blacklisted. Nor can
you refuse to answer on the ground of the
First Amendment, because the Su reme Court
has in effect annulled the First mendment.

Well, then, why not simply throw your-
self on the Committee's mercy? Why not say,
"Look, gentlemen: I have committed no
crime, and you have accused me of none; yet
if I answer one way, I'm in jeo ardy of jail
for contempt; if I answer the ot er way, I'm
in jeopardy of jail for perjury——even though
I tell the truth. So you see, I MUST refuse to
answer."

It won't work. The courts have ruled that
fear of unjust prosecution for perjury is not
sufficient ground for refusal to ‘answer.

In ﬁne, there is only one ground that has

‘stood the test (so far) of protecting the in-

nocent, and that is the Fifth Amendment, the
most pertinent clauses of which provide:

No person shall . . . be compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness
against himself, nor be deprived of
life, liberty or property, without due
process of law . . .

By court ruling, the Amendment applies
to investigating committees as well as cases
in criminal court.

Refusal to answer "on the rounds of the
Fifth Amendment” is the onfy reliable pro-
tection the witness has today against "self-
incrimination.” -

. Now the term "self-incrimination” means
simlply placing yourself in danger of crim-
ina prosecution. It does NOT mean you are
guilty or even accused of any crime. Never-
theless, the Committeemen never lose a
chance to inject into the oﬂicial record their
belief that anyone who invokes the Fifth
Amendment is "guilty” of “Communism" or
"treason."

Which brings to mind the story about a
reform candidate in Boston who lost an elec-
tion because the machine politician running
against him kept referring to him as a "sex-
agenarian." No matter how often the re-
former explained that the word merely meant
a man inhis sixties, the pre'udicial syllable
sex stuck in the public mind and suggested
that he must be guilty of something unmea-
tionable.

Similarly, the un-Americans insist on the
prejudicial word self-incrimination in con-
nection with the Fifth Amendment. They
find it indispensable for confusing the pub-
lic, since it suggests a crime that the witness

"It is now no child’: lay to save the
principles of jefferson rom total over-
throw in this nation . . . The principles
of Iefferson are the definitions and
axioms of free society . . . The [who
deny and evade them are t e van-
guard, the miners an suppers of re-
turning des otism. We must repulse
them, or t ey will subiugate us.”-
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

( self ) is confessing. Whenever a victim uses
the exact language of the Amendment to_re-.
fuse "to be a witness against himself,” Com-
mitteemen will try by every means to ut the
word incriminate into his mouth. “ at do
you mean by that? You mean you're afraid
of self-incrimination? You have reason to
fear prosecution in a criminal case?” (70)
Now the Committee knows perfectly well the
courts have ruled that a witness need say no
more than "on the grounds of - the Fifth
Amendment” to establish his privilege. Still
they would force him to appear a criminal
if possible.

From this kind of underhanded attack
upon you there is NO protection.

Except knowledge.

Do you know what the purpose of the
Fifth Amendment is? And why it is in the
Constitution? Do you think it is there for
"criminals” to "hide behind,” as the Com-
mittee would have you think? Or is it there
for the safety and freedom of the innocent?

“A HISTORY or STRUGGLE”

The right to keep silent in the face of in-
quisition —— a right guaranteed every Amer-
ican by the First and Fifth Amendments—
has a history even older than the right to
speak out, as is shown by the following pas-
sage from the gospel:

"And Pilate asked him, ‘Art thou the
King of the Iews?’ '

"And he, answering, said unto him,
‘Thou sayest it.’_

"And the chief priests accused him of
many things; but he answered nothing.

"And Pilate asked him again, saying,
'Answerest thou nothing? Behold how
many things they witness against thee.’

- f’But [est/'s yet answered nothing; so that
- Pilate marvelled.”-- MARK XV, 2-5.

The story of the Fifth Amendment can be
told here only in barest outline. It was at-
torney Laurence R. Sperber who succeeded
in giving the least interrupted version of it
before the un-Americans:

“The history of the privilege against self-
ingrimination is one of aﬂording protection
to political dissenters . . . a history of
struggle against, orthodoxy. It was art of

the struggle against the Star C amber
which, from -the year 1487, was invested

with the authority to compel defendants
[by torture if necessary] to testify under
oath . . .To refuse either to take the oath
or to answer under it was taken as con-
fession of the offense charged. (Emphasis
supplied.) (71)
The un-Americans, too, assert that refusal to
testify is tantamount to confession. Thus
their direct descent from the mediaeval Star
Chamber is made clear. American courts have
repeatedly ruled, however, that no inferences
may be drawn from a witness’: refusal to an-
swer. Mr. Sperber continues:
"It was non-conforming clergymen who
enlisted the support of the famous maxim
. . . which is the source of the privilege . . .
that no one is bound to accuse himself,
Accusare nerno so dehet . . . at the close
of the 16th century. . . .
"The privilege developed in English law
for the ve purpose of protecting political
and reli tous non - conformers against
charges 0 heresy and unorthodoxy.

"So, too, in this country it was recisely
the current type of hysteria against un-
orthodoxy that the various provisions of
the Bill of Rights were intended to pre-
vent." (Emphasis supplied.) (72)

The Founding Fathers, Supreme Court
Justice Black reminds us in a famous opinion,
"were not satisﬁed that the First Amend-
ment would make this right [of free
expression] suﬁiciently secure. As they
well knew, history teaches that attem t-
ed exercises of the freedom of re ig-
ion, speech, press and assemh y have
been the commonest occasions for op-
pression and persecution. Inevitahly
such persecutions have involved secret
arrests, unlawful detention, Zorced con-
fessions, secret trials and ar itrary gun-
ishments under oppressive laws. T ere-
fore it is not surprising that the men
behind the First Amendment also in-
sisted upon the Fifth . . .” (73)

The Fifth Amendment, in other words,
was intended by the makers of the Bill of
Rights to act as a second line of defense in
case Congress should pass oppressive laws
interfering with free speech, press or assem-
bly. It is entirely in the spirit of the Found-
ing Fathers, therefore, that the Fifth be in-
voked -— indeed must be invoked, as a mat-
ter of duty and obligation —- before a Com-
mittee which has so repeatedly nulliﬁed the
First.

Justice Black says further of -the Founding
Fathers:

"If occasionally these safdguards

_;5_.

 

 

worked to the advantage of an or-
dinary criminal, that was a price they
were willing to pay for the freedom
they cherished.” (73) ‘

The Un-American Committeemen, alas, do
not strikingly resemble the Founding Fathers.

“LEGAL ABRACADABRA"

"My counsel . . . advise: me that t/.2i.r
burineu. . .1’: extremely tricky. . . . Now
I do not want to waive {tbe privilege}
and I want to take all of the neceuary
legal abracadabra. . . to preserve it.”—-
ArT’Y SPENCER AUSTRIAN. (74)

Honoring and using the Fifth Amendment
has been made a highly technical procedure.
The courts have ruled that a witness must
ertablir/2 /air constitutional privilege of re-
fusing to testify against himself at tlae very
first quertion that opens up the area danger-
ous to him (in this case the vague area of
"subversiveness”). If he answers any ues-
tion within that area, he is presumed to ave
"waived his privilege” as to all questions in
the same area, and from that moment on, he
must answer or risk prosecution for con-
tempt.

Are you lost already? Very well, let's look
at these two cases:

CASE ALPHA

Q: Are you a member of the Committee to

I Abolish the Un-American Committee?

A: Yes, and proud of it.

Q: Who are the leaders of it?

A: I refuse to answer on the grounds of the
Fifth Amendment.

Q: Name the other members.

A: I refuse to answer on the same grounds.

CASE BETA

Q: Are you a member of the Committee to
Abolish the Un-American Committee?

A: I refuse to answer on the grounds of the
Fifth Amendment.

Q: Will you tell us all ytix know about the
Committee?

A: I refuse to answer on the same grounds.

Q: Do-you know X.Y.Z., the‘President of that
Committee?

A: I refuse, etc.

Th courts have ruled that Alpha waived his
constitutional right not to testify, when he
answered, “Yes, and proud of it.” So when
later he refused to name names, he was cited
for contempt and his conviction and jail sen-
tence were upheld. Beta, ‘on the contrary,

establirbed his constitutional right at tlge very
outset and maintained it consistently by refus-
ing to testify to all questions regarding the
Committee to Abolish Un-Americans.

Incidentally, the un-Americans claim that

-to urge abolishment of their Committee is

"subversive.”

Is it getting clearer now? Do you see what
you are up against? All right, suppose you
take the witness chair.

Q: Have you ever belonged to the League
Against Restrictive Covenants?
A: Yes.

Unknown to you, that organization, de-
voted purely to ending racial segregation in
Los Angeles (the name is ﬁctional, for ur-
poses of illustration only) has been oﬂicially
cited as a "Communist front” organization.
Unwittingly, you have admitted connection
with "the Communist movement.”

It’s bad enough to have ut your own neck
in the Committee's noose, but that’s only the
start of your trouble; because the next ques-
tion is: "Who else were members of the
League?"

You hesitate. All your life you’ve heard
it was dishonorable to tattle on others.

The Committee inquisitor asks it another
way: "Well, was ‘X.Y.Z. a member?"

To answer Yes cannot possibly do X.Y.Z.
any good. It can only damage him, perhaps
even destroy him, by connecting him too with
"_Communism.” You know him to be inno-
cent of the least crime; yet the moment ‘you
name him, not only he but also his whole
family and all -hisfriends will be sus ect——
maybe subpoenaed, smeared and bla isted.

You think, "How can anyone name even
one name, let alone ﬁfty or a hundred as
some stoolpigeons have done?”

Yet you cannot refuse to answer the ques-
tion. It’s too late for that now. You waived
your privilege wlaen you admitted member-
:/aip in the League. If now you refuse to
name other members you’ will be cited for
contempt, go to jail, pay a ﬁne—and be
blacklisted to boot. > .

You start to think: “It's me or him ————”

No! That’s a lie!

Suppose you do name X.Y.Z., excusing
yoursef on the -ground that after all he is
"only one” member and he never made any
secret of it anyway. . . . Wait. What's the next
question? “Name the other members." So

the one name becomes — oh, so reluctantly!
- three or four — then eight or ten. It mul-
tiplies alarmingly in spite of you—— liberals,
progressives, all your associates—all smeared

y association —— and by the time you are
through testifying you are through as a hu-
man being — lost and haunted and damned.

So you see, regardless whether you are or
are not a Communist, you cannot answer
either Yes or No without destroying your-.
self, and others. It is not a question of "me
or him,” but of all of us together. What we
have to do, regardless of aﬂiliation or belief,
is to refuse to answer all questions in the
witch-hunting area, starting with the very
ﬁrst. In thus protecting yourself, you will be
protecting the Fifth Amendment privilege
itself; for, as Dr. Monroe puts it:

"Any such right which we lore under-
Jtanding of, or courage to use —that
right we will alto lore.” (Emphasis
supplied.) (54)

“Tina FINAL Tnsr”

"If we didn’t have the Fi th Amend-
ment we would probably nd out . . .”
——CONGRESSMAN DONALD L. JACK-
SON. (75)

The Committee is not really interested in
whether or not you are a Communist. It is
engaged in the compilation of lists of names
for blacklist, with which to terrorize and si-
lence liberals who might otherwise cry out
against proﬁtable evils — inﬂation, war-prof-
iteering, housing shortages, segregation and
discrimination. -

All witnesses are blacklisted except
stoolpigeons.

. Name-naming, Rep. Jackson keeps reiterat-
mg, is
'('t7l:Se) ﬁnal test of credibility of a witness."

Even stoolpigeons are castigated (and not
too subtly threatened) if they don't name
names enough promptly ‘enough. (77) Their
cooperation, the implacable Jackson insists,
is graded according to J

"the willingness and frankness of the wit-
ness to testify fully and completely on his
associations and activities . . . wit rpecial
empharir placed upon hi: auociate: . . .
Again I say thi: is the crux of thi: in-
1/e.rtigation.” (Emphasis supplied.) (78)

Thanks to the Fifth Amendment no one
need name names unless he deliberately
chooses to be a stoolpigeon. However, Com-

mitteemen have repeatedly betrayed a wish
that the Amendment were not in their way.
(79) At the Washington hearings of 1951
the then chairman, Re . Wood, announced
that "contempt procee ings are under con-
sideration a ainst” witnesses invoking the
Fifth Amencfment privilege; and Rep. Velde,
the present chairman, "castigated [two wit-
nesses] for their deﬁance and said he would
press contempt charges against both." (81)

So far, the Fifth Amendment, unlike the
First, has withstood the onslaughts of cun-
ning old Fury. (82) There have been prose-
cutions designed to destroy it, but they have
failed, and it remains your stoutest armor
against tyranny.

The Fifth Amendment is, of course, a de-
fense against legal prosecution only. It does
not protect you tom economic perrecution by
blacklist. Today in America, whoever in-
vokes his country's Constitution before un-
Americans is barred from employment and
sentenced to the economic death penalty, re-
gardleu whether he is a Communirt, non-
Communist, or anti-Communist.

Why then have hundreds of courageous
Americans chosen to stand by the Bill of
Rights even at the price of blacklist?

Is it to stay out of jail? Partly, yes — why
give hostages to Un-America?

Is it to reject the role of a stoolpigeon?
Partly, of course. .

Is it to avoid giving aid, comfort or co-
operation to the most subversive force in
American life today——the witch-hunt? Again,
yes.

However, the main reason is that it is the
best position from which to ﬁght against un-
American tyranny. You cannot ﬁght effec-
tively from jail. You cannot ﬁght at all by
cooperation with the evil you ought to abol-
ish. But in protecting yourself you achieve
the far more important goals of protecting
all other Americans from dictatorship,
strengthening the Constitution in the service
of the people, and driving the witch-hunt off
the national scene, using the most funda-
mental American weapons in the most fun-
damental American interest.

4. There Is a Doctor in the House

"The regimen I adopt shall be for the beneﬁt of my patients according to my
ability and judgment and not for their hurt or for any wrong. Whatsoeoer
house I enter, there I will go for the beneﬁt of the sick, refraining from all
wrong-doing and corruption. Whatsoeuer I see or hear concerning the life of
men In my attendance upon the sick or even apart therefrom, which ought not

to he noised abroad, I will beep silence thereon, counting such thing
sacred secrets.”— From the Hippocratic Oath, Subscribed to by all M.

COUNTERATTACK

"Obviously, no physician who tahes
his Hip ocratic Oath seriously — and
all oo physician: do — can possibly
col aborate with the Un-American
Committee/’— DR. FRED G. REY-
NOLDS. (83)

Now that we have glanced at the record
and methods of the un-Americans and
learned why it is inevitable for the honest
witness to refuse to answer witch-hunting
guestions, we are in a better position to un-

erstand what it means to our community
when sixty or more rofessional men and
women are dragged ike felons before the
un-Americans, baited and trapped by legal
hair-splitters, and smeared as enemies of
their country by every‘ avenue of propa-
ganda available to the eighty-billion-dollar
budget of the government.

And we can better a preciate the resource-
fulness and courage 0 our doctors, lawyers
and entertainers in the witness-chair.

The witness before the un-Americans (un-
less he is a stool igeon, in which case he
treads the usual primrose path to his particu-
lar hell) is in much the same dilemma as the
political candidate who was labelled a sex-
agenarian. So long as he merel defends him-
self he is at a hopeless disa vantage; it is
all too easy to make him look guilty, simply
by asking him a long series of questions
which he must decline to answer.

His only chance lies in counterattack. The
candidate might have won the election if, in-
stead of trying to explain, he had assailed
his opponent's crooked politics or cited his

to be

own record of accomplishment. This, under
the most diﬂicult conditions, is what our
professionals tried to do at the hearings in
the autumn of 1952. ’

HIPPOCRATES BLACKLISTED

"I saw blood on this table yesterday.
Forty families were destroyed yester-
day, Mr. Wood. Do you realize what
that means? Those men are not warh-
ing now. How are they going to feed
their children ?”— DR. ALEXANDER E.
PENNES. (84)

In the above excerpt from his appearance
before old Fury, Dr. Pennes referred to the
testimony of two stoolpigeons who between
them had named some forty names. He him-
self had been blacklisted some time earlier,
as he explained:

“On September 21 [1931], while you were
questioning. a doctor . . . you mentioned
my name twice, and you spelled out my
name to make sure that everybody got it,
and the following day at 10 o'clock in the
morning, the superintendent of the hospi-
tal [St. Joseph's.,O-nmge, Calif.] asked me
to resign because of the associated pub-
licity. This, mind on, atrer 7% years of
excellent service a mitted by the superin
tendent." (85)

As a result, the witness charged, his in-
come had been cut—4 by direct inﬂuence of
the Committee. Chairman Wood jumped in
to defend himself and his colleagues:

Mr. Wood: . . . it is not this committee
that has cut his income off; it is him. [to
the witness} We are giving you an op-
portunity now to restore it, if indeed you
have lost it, by simply telling us the truth.
Dr. Pennes: By becoming an informer?

_..;p...

  

F o rewh o r d

The House Un-American Activities Committee has long stood
indicted of subverting the Billof Rights.

Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, former president of Amherst College,
recently said:
"A legislative committee which asks the question, ‘Are
you a Republican P’ or ‘Are you a Communist)’, accom-
panying the question with the threat of harm or disrepute
if the answer is this rather than that, stands in contempt
of the sovereign people to whom it owes submission.”

In recent months, its sneering abuse of those who claim their con-
stitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment has been particularly
odious.

It has shown total disregard for American principles of due
process.

Because it does not trust our traditions, it is causing the whole
world to distrust us. Says the London News Chronicle:

"The committee is the most un-American feature of life
in the United States—— practicing those very evils of
which they accuse the Kremlin and its satellites.”

Every generation must claim for itself the guarantees of our Bill
of Rights. A logical ﬁrst step for us is the abolition of the Un-Ameri-
can Committee. Every Congressman must be urged to vote against all
appropriations for its activities. Every citizen must declare, with Ben-
jamin Franklin: -

"They that give up essential liberty to ohtain a little
temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.”

This pamphlet records how a group of Americans in Los Angeles
acted in the tradition of our Founding Fathers to preserve our liberties.
May it inspire other Voices of Resistance across the country.

A. A. HEIST

Chairman, Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms

Mr. Wood: Well, if you want to put it
that way, yes.

Dr. Pennes: I would not become an in-
former -if you cut off the other two-thirds
of my income, or all of it. (86)

Thus the deal offered all witnesses by the
Committee was explicitly in the record for
all to see: Become a stoolpigeon and you
can have your job back.

The same horse-trade was implicit in two
other exchanges during the hearings:

1, between actor Herman Waldman and

Rep. Clyde Doyle:

Mr. Waldman: I heard you say, "We want
these people to testify so they can go back
to their jobs . .  Would you guarantee
that l have a. job to go back to after I
testify? Would you guarantee me that?

Mr. Doyle: I wish I could. I wish I could
have your guarantee that you are not a
member of the Communist Party. You
could get some guarantee then. (87)

What Mr. Doyle left implicit was: "And
remember, the ‘crux of this investigation’ is
the naming of names for blacklist. So name
names and we'll guarantee you a job.”

2, between Attorney Ben Margolis and
Rep. Jackson. A few days before, Jackson
ha gone out of his way, publicly, "to in-
sure that no reprisals are taken” against a
stoolpigeon’s wife who was “employed by
the Board of Education at Santa Monica."
(88) Margolis referred to this and asked:

. . . that the chairman give assurance that
he will make the request that no penalties
be imposed upon the witnesses that we
represent . . .

Mr. Jackson: I_have asked, Mr. Margolis,
that no penalties be inﬂicted upon any
witness who has appeared before this com-
mittee.

Mr. Margolis: That means you are opposed
to the blacklist, Mr. Jackson, in Holly-
wood?

Jackson, cornered, ducked the question. He
had protected the stoolpigeon’s wife, he ex-
plained, because she had not known of her
usband’s "Communist" beliefs. But Mar-
golis persisted:
"By that, you infer that otherwise you
wish penalties to be imposed?"

Mr. Jackson was silent, and Rep. Doyle
bailed him out by resuming the hearings.
(89) But once more the implication was
clear: Be a stoolpigeon (or married to one)
and the Committee will go out of its wa

to protect your job. Refuse and you’ll be
blacklisted.

On Dec. 28, 1951, Dr. Pennes had suf-
fered a second bladdisting, along with two
other prominentlos Angeles physicians, Dr.
Richard W. Lippman and Dr. Murray Abo-
witz, when the trio' were dropped from the
roster of physicians at the Cedars of Lebanon
Hospital without charges or even notiﬁcation
of any kind.

Only one thing is certain: they were not
dropped for incompetence. All three were
eminent in their ﬁelds. Dr. Lippman was
not only head of the kidney disease clinic at
the Cedars but also an important research
scientist, Chairman of the Society of Experi-
mental Medicine and Biology, who was do-
ing research in nephritis and blood pressure
under grants from the National Heart In-
stitute and the Guggenheim Foundation. Dr.
Abowitz, specialist in internal medicine, was
head of the arthritis clinic; while Dr. Pennes,
a radiologist, was a member of the tumor
clinic.

Although the hospital's trustees have never
given any explanation of their arbitrary
overruling of their own medical board in
this matter, it is no mystery why the three
were ﬁred.

All of them were members of the Medi-
cal Division of the Southern California
Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professions,
Dr. Abowitz being chairman. The Medical
Division had recently issued, after a year
of research, an important report concerning
discrimination against Negro physicians and
patients in Los Angeles hospitals (of which
the Cedars of Lebanon was far from inno-
cent), and that report had actually brought
about signiﬁcant reforms. The Division had
also ublished a study of civilian defense
and t e atom bomb. It had openly advocated
national health insurance. It had led a suc-
cessful ﬁght against the Burns Bill which
would require a test of political orthodoxy
for anyone applying for a license from the

doctors, lawyers, beauti-

Dr. Abowitz was also an authority on oc-
cu ational diseases and industrial accidents.
His testimony as an expert had helped win
dozens of suits for compensation for sick
or injured workers, and had cost the big
corporations millions of dollars in improve-
ments to their plants to protect workers
from occupational hazards such as lead
poisoning. So it is by a curious coincidence
that suddenly Dr. Abowitz ceased being
called as a witness in compensation cases -—
and was also drop ed from the facul of the
Medical School of the University 0 South-

A ern California.

A year later the Cedars of Lebanon ave
community health another set-back by b -
listing four more doctors from its staﬂ: Drs.
Simpson Marcus, Joseph Hittelman, Jacob
Druckman and Frederick G. Reynolds. This
time the trustees, headed by Ben R. Meyer,
chairman of the board of the Union Bank
and Trust Co., brought overtly political
charges —that the four had exhibited "ar-
rogance” before the un-Americans in re-
fusing to turn stoolpigeon and name names
—— which is sufficient indication that the
action was taken under direct pressure- by
the un-Americans.

"PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT Auxn”

"Political supervision in the dﬁeld of
medicine has in the past an cannot
help but reduce medical standards by
its very nature . . . No politician is
qualiﬁed to cure heart disease or
polio, or cancer or any other disease
. . . They have no business attaching

' professionals, denying the right of pa-
tients to medical care of their choosing
. . . To condone this committee would
he the same as aiding {it} in its de-
struction of human lives, and I mean
American human lives.” ——- DR. WAL-
TER KEMPLER. (90)

The effect on you, on every citizen of
every color and creed and nationality in
Los Angeles, of this blacklisting of Hippo-
crates, ought to be obvious. As the original
victims of banker Meyer and his trustees
said in their public statement:

"If. this dictatorial, punitive action suc-
ceeds, the way will be paved for destruc-
tion of our preciously won high standards
of medical practise and research; physician
and patient alike will be subject to the
vicious whims of small men.” (91)

For other hospitals too are controlled by
small men with large purses. Physicians have
been dropped for political (not professional)
reasons at the Veterans Administration hos-
pital, the Los Angeles City Child Hygiene
Clinic, and the Queen of Angels Hospital,
in addition to St. Joseph’s in Orange County
and the Cedars.

If this contagion spreads it will eventually
affect ou (if it has not already) through
your octor. He may be a pillar of con-
servatism and immune to Committee attack;
yet for that very reason he may be afraid
to call in the best consultant available in
your case— as, for example, Dr. Lippman
in a kidney ailment.

Su pose you are a worker, sick or dis-
able as a result of the type of work you
are doing. You may lose hundreds of dollars
in compensation if your lawyer is afraid

to call in a medical expert on occupational _

hazards, regardless of his politics, to testify
on your behalf.

If you are a Negro or a member of some
other minority, you may well ask what is
to happen to the cam aign to end all dis-
crimination in hospit s, if the leaders of
that ﬁght are to be blacklisted from their
profession.

If you are a doctor you may hesitate to
urge such professional advances as health
insurance or abolition of segregation, for
fear of being barred from some banker-
dominated hospital.

Will you have to prove yourself politic-
ally orthodox before you can have your
appendix out?

These are very sober questions. The terror
that has paralyzed Hollywood and degraded
ﬁlms to an all-time low started with the
persecution of 10 men in 1947. By 1951

"more than 300" were being blacklisted in

' a single year. The same snowballing can

occur in any other profession in any other
city unless the community rises in its wrath
to prevent it.

Ormumon GUILLOTINB

Before the Committee the physicians gen-
erally began their testimony with dignity, as
if the Congressmen were honestly interested
in learning the rofessional man’s view of
conditions in e health services. Being
themselves absorbedin making Los Angeles
a better and healthier oommunix they tried
to communicate their social jectives as
scientists and physicians—- only to be met
with impatience and hostility. If they per-
sisted they got abuse, threats and prompt
dismissal.

At the 1951 hearings, for example, Dr.
Max Schoen tried to explain what he meant
by to ressive views in dentistry, only to be
h ed and ﬁnally informed that he was "a
very dangerous  (92) In 1952 it was
the same only worse. One after another
Drs. Druckman, Roberts, Lester, Pe , Rey-
nolds and Kern ler tried to relate e nor-
rosive effect o un-American hearin on
the community and the medical pro ession
—- in vain. Dr. Milton Lester, for example,
explained that:

"It is myhduty . . . to resist the imposi-
tion on e American people and on my-
self of fantasies that don't accord with
reality . . . [for instance,] the prime slogan
that this committee has sought to foist on
the American people is something about a

conspiracy of Communism. In my opinion
this is a delusion." (93)

The Committee, however, had no inten-
tion of allowing any dispellin of the de-
lusions .and fantasies they h worked so
hard to impose on the voters.

During the appearance of o tometrist E.
Howard Davis things got so ast and furi-
ous that the Committee forgot its preten-
sion that it was not a court. The air was
ﬁlled with "You are,” "I am not," "You
have," "I have not,” "Delete it from the
record," "We object,” and "Your objection
is overruled." The passage in question, sup-
Eressed from the oﬂicial record, was Dr.

avis‘ unanswerable charge, echoing that

of the Ford Motor Co.’s lawyer, (94) that:

“I am accused of no crime, and yet I am
being tried by this committee without the
rocedures itrmnteed to me under the
Sixth’ Amen ent . . . It is your intent to
unish me if I do not cooperate with the
mmittee, . . . to punish me by publicity,
and by your threat to invert!’ ate an or-
ganization which does not do ionr bi ding
—and I refer to your report: at the be-
ginning of this year in which that threat
was) made." (Italicized portion deleted.)
(95

Dr. Davis was only telling the simple
truth. But it is precisely the simple truth
that old Fury cannot aﬂord to have gpsread
upon the record. These are the meth at-
torney Robert W. Kenny, counsel for many

of the witnesses, was referring to when '

he said to Chairman Wood:

"If a guillotine is to be operated on the
people, I don't think we have to speed it
up. (96)

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT char-
acterized the Un-American Committee's
activities as "sordid . . . flagrantly un-
fair and Un-American.”

"The [Cornnu'ttee’s] program so
closely parallels the program of the
Klan that there is no distinguishable
difference between them.” —— AMES

5. Spokesmen of the People

"I do not think there is any roup in America outside the lawyers who can be

expected to preserve the in ividual liberties about which people speak. The‘

liberty of the individual to go to the church of his choice, to belong to the
party of his choice, to speab his views, however had we may think they are.
No people but the lawyers, and when they ail, the torch of individual liberty
will be carried by nobody else.”— JUSTICE UGO BLACK. (97)

Onucmts or THE COURT

"I respectfully submit, your Honor,
that a country with an intimidated bar
is a country whose liberties are in dan-

er . . . I speak of intimidation not
in personal terms. If it be necessary
that in the cause of American liberty
I shall have to serve six months, then
I say to your Honor the price will
have been very, very small. '— AT'I"Y
HARRY SACHER to ]ud e Harold Me-
dina who had just cited him for con-
tempt of court. (98)

The lawyers dragooned before the un-
Americans in 1952 were keenl aware of
their s ecial responsibilities — rst rhaps
to their clients, but also, and no gs im-
portantly, to the community at large. Law-
yers are "oﬂicers of the court,” instruments
y which democratic rights are translated
from pious words on paper into concrete
acts o freedom and feelings of happiness.
Attorney Rose Rosenberg ably summarized
their s 'al situation when she told the
Commr eemen:

"No one should be subjected to the co-
ercion of this committee, and I think it is
articularly vicious when lawyers are.
en lawyers are attacked, it is an attadc
on the people, because it is the tradition
of this country that lawyers have been the
spokesmen of the people, . . . the advance
guard. d when you strike at the advance
guard, ou strike at the riﬁht of the people
to spea out; for if you s poena me— let
us not be naive—-those who look to law-
yers will be silenced . . ." (99)

Therefore, when the ﬁrst of the attorneys
to testify, Fred Steinmetz, was called to the
stand, his counsel offered a motion to the

Committee to quash his subpoena and those
of all other lawyers on the grounds that:

"Legislative interrofgation of lawyers . . . is
a circumvention o the safeguards set up
by the courts to protect the sanctity of the
lawyer-client relationship. Once the prece-
dent is allowed to be established under
which lawyers may be haled before legis-
lative committees for public interrogation
as to their private beliefs and associations,
then fear will come to rule the consulta-
tion room. . . . The rinciple of exclusive
judicial control of the r must be jealously
maintained." (Emphasis supplied.) (100)

In the space of a ten-minute recess the
Committee disposed of the learned 12-page

brief. The motion was, in a single sentence,
denied.

The attorneys were not conjuring anxiety
out of thin air. Legionnaires were bayin
for their disbarment. (101) Within the
year several lawyers had served jail sen-
tences for committing no offense but to
defend unpo ular clients too zealously to

suit the presiding judge Others had also _

been disbarred or suspended. (102)

Previous to these cases, the only permis-
sible grounds on which a lawyer could be
disbarred or suspended were:

“where the attorney has been guilty of
corrupt conduct; of some attempt to suborn
a witness, or to bribe a juror, or to forge
a document, or to embezzle clients’ proper-
? or other things abhorrent to honest and
air dealing.” (Emphasis supplied.) (103)

Attorney Sacher had been charged with no

such corrupt or abhorrent acts, but merely
with being endowed with

"a tem

op ze in representing his client that it
0 his recognition of responsibility

ament which led to such excess .

as an oﬁcer of the Court . .  (Emphasis
supplied.) (104)

So the lawyers who faced cunning old
Fury last fall were ﬁghting not only for
the rights of their clients and of al citi-
zens who refuse to crawl before usurped
power, but also for their own right to per-
orm their professional duties with all the
zeal that makes an effective spokesman of
the people.

How To BLACKLIST A LAWYER

"No fear of judicial favor or public
urzpopularity should restrain him the
lawyer} from the full discharge 0 his
duties.” — CANONS or PROFESSIONAL
ETHICS.

By now it should be clear to the reader
that a lawyer cannot be literally blacklisted
unless he belongs to the tiny elite under
retainer by a corporation. 95% of lawyers,
being self-employed, cannot be ﬁred like
screenwriters or exiled from hospitals like
surgeons.

The can, of course, be disbarred or sus-
‘ende . But a far more widespread and ef-
ective method of blacklist is the witch-hys-
teria itself, which revents citizens like you
from retaining a highly skilled attorney who
may have been denounced by the un-Ameri-
cans or pilloried for defending unpopular
clients. You think (or anyhow you are
encouraged to think), "Will the Judge be
fair to me if I'm represented by this at-
torney? Maybe I ought to dget someone less
competent but more ortho ox in His Hon-
or's eyes."

If you act on this un-American sugges-
tion, you do a triple injury: to yourself by
depriving you of expert legal help; to the
lawyer by helping b acklist him; and espe-
cially to the community by helping per-
petuate the hysteria that lowers professional
standards and substitutes orthodoxy for com—
petence and zeal.

The evil of blacklist takes many forms.
The legal profession itself becomes paralyzed
with fear. Steve Nelson, a defendant seeking
counsel in a Smith Act trial in Pittsburgh,
reported:

I!

. . . over 730 law ﬁrms approached either

in erson or bly mail in Pittsburgh and
l(’hi ar)ielphia al refused to defend us."
105

 

Among the reasons given for refusal was
this one:

"Your case is hopeless. The judges, the
courts, everything is rigged against you.”
(Emphasis supplied.)

Justice Douglas, in the article already
cited, (2) paid special attention to this
terror in the profession of law, as a result
of which nonconformists i

"have difiicul ttin re utable la ers
to defend thenti’. Ewyefs halite talked thyme
about it. Many are worried. Some could
not volunteer their services, for if th
did they would lose their clients and their
ﬁrms would suffer. Others could not volun-
teer because if they did they would be
dubbed ‘subversive’ by their community. . . .
This is a dark tragedy."

This "dark tragedy” involves not only
Communists in need of legal aid but to a
much greater extent it affects liberals and
progressives who are opposed to the cold-
war witch-hunt. One Los Angeles lawyer,
in refusing to take the case of a liberal who
was slated to testify but would not stool for
the Committee, added that he would even
refuse to represent anyone who might con-
ceivably be subpoenaed.

Which of course pushes the situation to
one of reductio ad absurdum, since any
principled American might very well be sub-
poenaed on the ground that he was a
principled American.

“I'VE Gorr TO LIVE WITH ME”
". . . this committee lives by the in-
former, and it is ini uitous to the
Iewish religion . . . an it is iniquitous
to the Christian religion, because you
have your Iudas Iscariot. The world
abhors the informer; and you live by
it, and it is your bread and butter,
and without it you would be out of
existence.” —— ATT’Y JACK TENNER.
(106)

It was felt to be necessary, for the sake
of America’s moral reputation in the family
of nations, to examine critically the Com-
mittee’s valentine to the Stoolpigeon as
America’s Sweetheart. With unﬂagging va-
riety of phrasing, Committeemen had tossed
bouquets to the Informer, lauding him as
being “as much a contribution perhaps, as
. . . a bomber, or a tank" (107) ——or as
the exemplary Patriot who has "had the

_..34_

honesty” to “come down here” and "co-
operate,” and, "without any feeling of ran-
cor, which perhaps would be natural as a
result of your ex erience," (108) "make
a contribution to e security of the United

States" (109) against the "subversive and '

military aggression of Soviet Communism"
(110) by "answering questions frankly and
openly," (111) thus rendering "a distinct
service to the country." (112) The task of
exorcising this ecto lastic Galahad was
cheerfully undertaken y all witnesses, start-
ing with the la ers. Mr. Margolis furnish-
ed the basic deﬁnwltion:

“Persons who violate conﬁdences with re-
spect to ideas, persons who . . . tattle with
respect to what their neighbors say, and
who listen at 1: holes, are stoolpigeons. . . .
Stoolpigeons, historically, never tell the
truth, -and they are incapable of it . . 
(113)

‘Although it is well known that stool-
pigeons appear in numbers directly propor-
tionate to the inducements oﬂ'ered, the of-
fers’ are seldom brought into the li t of
day. So the roof of the Federal Buil ng in
Los Angeles lifted erceptibly at the hear-
ings in the fall 0 '52, when Attorney
Grover Johnson testiﬁed casually:

"They have been around offering me money
to become a stool igeon. . . . But I am not
taking your 30 p eces of silver. I have to
live with me, you see.” (114)

‘ Cases of overt bribery are not necessary,
however, to reveal the vast corruptions in-
herent in the kind of "patriotism" which has
been called ,"the last refuge of a scoundrel.”

Blacklist is often diﬁcult to  from
blackmail or bribery. The Gang mugg who
sticks a gut in your gut may say: "Cooperate
and I’ll sli you a million-—or a job with
Howard ughes." Or he may say: "Co-
operate and I'll let you keep your million
—or your job at the Cedars of Lebanon."
In both cases the meaning is the same:
"Name names — or else!"

Blacklist is for those who sa No. To

make them say Yes, you'll ﬁnd bri more ‘

effective on the poor, blackmail on
—— that's all.

Both in destro 'ng corrosive myths and
in reaﬁrmin e creative truths about
America, the lawyers haled before the Com-
mittee brilliantly carried through the spe-
cial tasks imposed upon them by their
calling. California Supreme Court Justice
Jesse W. Carter was speaking of men like
them when he said:

"Great tribute is due to many outstanding
members of the Bench and Bar who, in
times ast, have had the courage to advo-
cate e cause of those in popular dis-
favor. It is as true today as in the past
that a lawyer representing an un pular
cause must endure . . . slurs, insuxlt: and
insinuations." (115) »

6. There Will Come a Time

"There will come a time in this country when there is no climate of fear
and coercion and hysteria, and people will of their own free will declare

with pride and honor—as the Puritans said the

would be glad to

declare -— their faith; but not under compulsion.” -- A'1'r’Y. Rosn RosnN-

"Tm: COM MHTBE No LONGER Danns”

The 1952 Los Angeles hearin opened on
Monday, Sept. 29. It was sche uled to last
two weeks or more. After less than two days
the Committee were crying quits. Thirteen
"s okesmen of the people" had used the

. witness-stand to warn America of the immi-

nent loss of her liberties, and in spite of the
anti-Communist hysteria of the commercial
press the truth was leaking out.

On Wednesday noon, visibly worried
about the effect on the voters, Chairman
Wood announced that the rest of the sub-
ers would not be heard in pub-
ey would be shunted oil to se-

following.
The lawyers leaped to the charge:

"that the committee no longer dares
to carry out its lawless purposes in
the open and now seeks to retreat
behind closed doors.” (117)

This was so patently true, and so damaging
to the Committee, that they immediately
backed down. Open hearings continued.

Prevented from suppressin testimon one
way, the Committee ed to do it an-
other—b “striking out of the record”
pages an pages of testimony damaging to
Committee restige. Among the subjects
stricken, which do not appear in the printed
reports of the hearings, were these:

That "the Korean war is an evil war."

(118)

That the Committee is in "an organized
conspira to destroy . . . my people’s
rights.” 119)

That "the First Amendment has been killed
by this committee." (120)

That the Committee conspired with the
Motion Picture Producers Association to
create a blacklist, and that it was "per-

tuating the un-American blacklist . . .
hired on the Big Lie." (121)

A reference to "the ﬁring of three doctors
from the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital."
(122)

That ."the only people that come forward
voluntarily" to testify “are stoolpigeons."
(123)

That Chairman Wood was illegally elected
because Negroes are denied the vote in
Georgia. (124)

 . . that not even your most cooperative
witness . . . has ever alleged any acts of
force or violence or any subversiveness
or any conspiracy to overthrow the gov-
ernment by force and violence, or even
the advocacy of it, by an one in the
motion tpicture industry" ter "investi-
gating e . . . industry for the past five
years." (125)

That "this committee strikes out [of the
record] any material which th do not
particularly like to hear." (126

The printed record that reaches the public,
therefore, is a censored, emasculated version
of the Committee's un-American activities.

WHO WON, Danny?

"The claim that the Committee has
done much to ‘educate’ the American
people to the menace o communism is
canceled by the committee’: success in
con usin and terrifying them. Terror
an con usion do not mahe for success-
ful defense aginst anything . . ."—
Los Aucnus am! News. (127)

The fears whip up by the un-Ameri-
cans are the bastar oiisprin of hysteria and
greed. Conditions that spells misery for mil-

__25_

 

lions are perpetuated only because they are
proﬁtable for a few. It is clear that when
there is a shortage of housin rents are high-
erand landlords proﬁteer. age differentials
that discriminate against Negroes or women

tend to lower the level of all wages and .

make proﬁts soar. War romotion means
guaranteed proﬁts of bil ions in cost- lus
orders for "goods” that do nothing but '11.
Isn't it obvious that if men are allowed to
think, speak and act freely, they will unite
to end such sins against humanity — and the
proﬁts made from them? Hence those who
proﬁt try to drug or slug people into giving
up their right to protest; and they persecute
those who refuse. (128)

But the real victim is You, the People.
That is why you ﬁght back.
That is why Los Angeles fought.

When a man comes home with a shiner or
a cauliﬂower ear, he is traditionally supposed
to remark, "Yeah, but you oughta see the
other guy” —— the implication being that, re-
gardless of appearances, he won.

If it were possible to inform the American
people fully of what is happening behind
our Newsprint Curtain, there can be little
doubt that the Un-American Committee
would be out of business today. In tbe bear-
ing room it was" beaten and beaten badly, its
subversive aims and methods itilessly ex-
posed. It would be easy to claim a victory
for the people. But it would be wrong — or
anyhow premature— so long as the Com-
mittee exists.

Ex-FBI-man Velde, the new Committee
chairman, has already launched his an-
nounced invasion of the universities and
the trade unions. Meanwhile the un-Ameri-
can conspiracy oes on between hearings, day
in, day out. e naming of names goes on,
the making of lists for smear, for slander,
for destruction. The blacklist oes on grow-
ing. Lives go on being ruin . Stoolpigeons
go on being coached for their perverse mo-
ment of " lory." The democracy of the
Founding Fathers goes on being perverted
and wrenched out of shape. Peace and civil
rights go on being howled down as "Com-
munist propagan a." Legionnaires 0 on
picketing what they are falsely to d are
"Communist movies.” Timid people go on
shying away from humanitarian causes for
fear these may be proclaimed “subversive."
Terror goes on paralyzing America.

It is no time to crow.
But neither i: it time to eat crow.

It is time to ﬁght. And this Los Angeles
has begun to do, in a hundred ways.

“Gar Worm TO THE PnopL1z!”

"To sin by silence wben we rbould
protest maker coward: of men.”-
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

In disproof of the lie that "it is only the
radicals" who o pose the Un-American Com-
mittee, let us lxpear again from conservative
Vice President Gossett of the Ford Motor
Co. For the evils engendered by committees
like that of the un-Americans he says,

"there will be no solution unless the peo-
ple are aroused . . . It is the function of
the Bar to warn the people of the dangers
.( .  We must get word to the people."
33

The secret of gettin word to the people
and rousing them to eéective community re-
sistance is a central coordinating agency. Los
Angeles acquired such a rallying point with
the appearance, in February, 1952, of the
Citizens Committee to Preserve American
Freedoms, formed in the wake of a blizzard
of subpoenas that descended upon profes-
sional men and women of Our Town.

Headed by the Rev. A. A. Heist, retired 

Methodist minister and former director of
the American Civil Liberties Union in Los
Angeles, the Citizens Committee focussed the
already existing public sentiment against Un-
America through a series of functions, mass
meetings, two issues of a tabloid (Fact: for
Freedom), page advertisements, and publi-
city (wherever the Newsprint Curtain could
be pi rced), well in advance of old Fury’:
arrival in town as well as during and after
the hearings.

In addition to preparing this ublication,
the Citizens Committee has issueg an album
of records, entitled Voice: 0 Resistance-
on-the-scene recordings of t e actual hear-
ings — which constitutes a priceless educa-
tion in high coura and eioquence.* A first
edition of the al um sold out virtually at

its appearance, and a second is nearing a-
haustion. No community anticipating inva-
sion by Un-America can afford to be with-
out these object lessons in struggle against
tyranny, for use in union halls, at mass meet-
ings and home gatherings, to ins ire those
who will lead the Resistance local y.

“SPEAK OUT! TALK BACK !” l

"I do not want any more lies, any
more prejudice, any more smears. I do
not want intimations, bear-sa or ru-
mor. I do not want unsi ned Liters or
nameless telephone cal s from either
side, or from anyone."-— RAY BRAD-
BURY. (129)

A high point of the Resistance in Los An-
geles came when the Committee invaded the
eld of religious freedom by subpoenaing
Ste hen H. Fritchman, pastor of the First
Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, to appear
at a secret session. Mr. Fritchman met the
un-Americans with a statement saying:
“. . . The sacredness of the minister-pan
ishioner relationship is inviolate. Some
140,000 clergymen of all religions in this
country value this hallowed custom of
privacy and have no intention of surrender-
ing it in a period of hysteria and intimi-
dation. . . . The history of religion in
America, Catholic, Jewish and Protestant,
has been one of healthy independency and
it must remain that way." (130)

The clergyman ﬂatly refused to answer
questions concerning "s eakers, meetings,
and the activities of my urch,” and on the
same day his -Board of Trustees voted unani-
mously to:

"give full support to his defense of Ameri-

can democracy and religious freedom."
Within a matter of days Mr. Fritchman’s
subpoena to appear at the open hearings was
quashed, and his resistance at the secret ses-
sion was suppressed from the Committee re-
port.

The lesson to be drawn from this Com-
mittee ﬁasco is that whenever the people
(in this case the Church's Trustees) exhi it
a determination to stand behind those
who resist Committee‘ dictation and in-
timidation, the Committee retreats or sur-
renders. It cannot browbeat a united
people.

Little by little, largely due to the activities
of the Citizens Committee, and in spite of

‘S42 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. Free, but
donation requested.

 

the Newsprint Curtain, America is learning
from Los Angeles not only what happens
when a community is inﬁltrated and booby-
trapped by un-Americans, but also how to
ﬁg t back. In New York, for instance, a new
fact sheet called Facts About Blacklz'st* has
appeared to kee you abreast of the ﬁght
against the soci plague of our time.

"Tan CONTAGION or COURAGE”

The virus spread by the Committee has in-
fected millions. .-

The epidemic will not be checked easily.

The roblem, as one doctor-witness sug-
gested, 15 to

“quarantine the carriers and spreaders of
the disease of fear. We must isolate them
from contact with our national bloodstream.
. . . The anti-toxin of courage is beginnin

to destroy the virus of fear in our lan .
From all over‘ our country the people are
beginning to talk back to those who would
silence them. . . . Courage is just as con-
tagious as fear. Let this contagion of cour-
a(1g£ )spread . . . "— DR. FRED G. REYNOLDS.

How shall we spread the contagion of
courage?

Any good doctor will tell you: by cultiva-
tion and communication.

Cultivate and communicate your courage!

Remember: every’ time you stiﬂe a good
word, every time you su press a good deed
or withhold a well-aime dollar, you do the
bidding of the un-Americans. So refuse to
be intimidated. Redouble your work for the
kind of America you want to leave your
children. Fight for your heritage—and
theirs.

Remember: truth is on your side. Spread
it. Set up a Citizens Committee in Every-
man's Town. Let it send forth the truth to
compete in the marketplace of ideas. Let it
rouse a healthy Resistance to un-American
falsehood and evil in high places.

Remember: the people stemmed the un-
American tide in Detroit and Los Angeles.
They rocked it back on its heels in Chicago.
So get word to the people!

Here is truth. Pass it on. Order more cop-
ies. (Order blank, p. 31;! Keep them mov-

. ﬁlly 4, 1951, reporter John Hunter of the

adison, Wis., Capital Times circulated a
"petition simply containing portions of the
Declaration of Independence and the Bill
of Rights." Of 112 persons approached,
only I signed. (Newsweek, 8/13/51.)
“Most of the persons who refused to sign
said it was ‘for fear of the consequences’
and 20 persons asked him if he was a
Communist. A woman . . said, ‘That may
be the Russian Declaration of Independence,
but you can't tell me it is ours.’ And a
man said, ‘Get the hell out of here with
that Communist stuff.’ . . . An elderly man
said, ‘I see you are using an old Commie
trick—putting God's name in a radical
petition.’ "—United Press, 7/28/51.

. In the early hours of Christmas, 1951, 7

youths, most of them Mexican-American,
were brutally beaten and sustained serious
injuries and broken bones at the Central
Police Station, Los Angeles, during a
"drinking brawl of 100 cops." The sadis-
tic policemen were reported to have "slipped
in the blood of their victims and howled
like men ‘full of lust’ " for their turn at
the sport. (Los Angeles Daily News,
5/ 13/52). Police Dept. inspectors tried to
hush case, prevent grand jury investigation
or prosecution of guilty cops. (Los An-
geles Times, 8/7/52.)

. On Dunsmuir Ave., Los Angeles, 3/ 16/ 52,

two bombs were exploded, wrecking two
homes: one of a Negro family, the other
of whites who were about to move out
to permit a Negro family to move in (L.A.
Times. 3/17/52). Local, state and federal
agencies were allegedly assigned to the case,
but none ever made an arrest or issued a
warrant orsubpoena.

These camps were authorized by the Mc-
Carran Act (Internal Security Act of 1950).
"According to James V. Bennett, Director
of the Bureau of Prisons, ‘$775,000 has
already been expended for the activation and
rehabilitation of six camps.’ With the aid of
convict labor work has already come along
well at camps in Avon Park, Florida; Flor-
ence and Wickenberg, Arizona; El Reno,
Oklahoma; Tule Lake [Calif.] and Allen-
wood [Pa.]. All estimates indicate they will
hold many more than the 50,000 or 60,000
Communists that ]. Edgar Hoover regularly
estimates there are in the U.S. . . . I per-
sonally interviewed more than 150 people
within an eighty mile radius of the camp
. . . With ew exceptions no one knew,
or expressed concern, -about the camp.
Those who did discuss the camp requested
that they should not be quoted; and some-
particularly the editors of the larger news-
papers in the region—freely admitted that
they purposel said nothing about it."-—

THE VERY Rnv. FRANCIS B. SAYRB, JR.
Dean of the I174:/Jington Catbedral
W4:/aington, D.C., Feb. 22, 1953;

Our Town — And Yours

This is a story about Our Town — Los Angeles. It is also the story
of Everyman’s Town. It's about what did happen here, and it's about
what will happen there unless we together act to prevent it.

Here it was chiefly the health, legal and entertainment profes-
sions that were involved. Elsewhere it may be teachers or labor circles
or civil service workers; but if we know what occurred in one city,
how it occurred, and why, and what was done about it, We shall
know better how to prevent its happening elsewhere.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce tells us that in 1951 alone "over
three hundred” men and women were blacklisted in Los Angeles as
a result of hearings by the Congressional’ Committee on Un-American
"Activities, I

Three hundred breadwinners forbidden to work means three
hundred families plunged into distress. Three hundred families means
1500 people. And at least an equal number of relatives and dependents
directly affected. Plus tens of thousands indirectly —— friends, asso-
ciates, tradesmen, employees . . . In one year.

Who were these people?

Just people. Like you. Film folk, some of them. Working people,
secretaries, stagehands, laborers. Others professionals, artists, writers,

' technicians . . .

What crime had they committed?
None. They were not even accused of any crime. (Note 1)
Then why are they being punished?

They were denounced as "subversive” by Un-American Committee
informers, then were summoned to prove‘ themselves not guilty of the
charge.

But is that fair?
What do you think?

1. The Plague On  Our Houses

"There has robably not been a period of greater intolerance than we witness
today. . . . T e Communist threat inside the country has been magniﬁed and
exalted far beyond its realities. Irresponsible talk by irresponsible peo le has
fanned the ﬂames of fear. Accusations have been loosely made. C aracter
assassinations have become common . . . Fear runs rampant . . .

"j ‘?‘T

"Fear has mounted —-fear of losing onefs job, fear of being investigated,
' fear of being pilloried. This fear has stereotyped our thinhin g, narrowed the

range of gree public discussion, and driven many thoughtful people to de-

span.”-

THAT SUDDEN REFLEX

You are not by any stretch of imagination
a "subversive” individual. And since the
Un-American Activities Committee claims to
be hunting "subversives” only, you may think
they are not concerned with you or you with
them. Certainly you have no reason to fear
anyone naming you as a Communist

But then why that sudden reﬂex? That
anxious glance over your shoulder? '

A great many people react that way these
days — people who have no connection what-
ever with Communism. They get . panicky,
hesitate to act or speak out. You too?

You are amon the large majority of
Americans who tel the Gallup pollsters in
conﬁdence that they favor getting out of
Korea and negotiating all differences between
nations —— but are you telling your Congress-
man? or your President? or saying it aloud
or in public?

Do you know that many citizens of Los
Angeles were afraid to attend a hearing by
their own City Council, and to press for
public housing, because one hysterical Coun-
cilman called everyone in favor of housing
“reds”? Would you go to such a hearing
tomorrow and speak up for housing?

Do you know that outstandin doctors
have been ﬁred from hospital s s merely
for their suspected political opinions? If so,
did you protest to the hospital trustees? or
to the newspapers? Did you sign your own
name to the protest?

UPREME COURT JUSTICE WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS. (2)

Do you know that subscribing to a certain

book club has been cited as evidence of "dis-'

loyalty” against a shipyard worker? Are you
getting wary of discussing what you read?
or of subscribing to anything? of saying any-
thing? of thinking . . . ?

You don't really believe
only people in favor of housing, do you?
or of peace? or competent medical care? or
good books? or saying what you think?

So why be afraid?

Every time you hesitate when you want’ to
act, every time you keep silent when you feel
like speaking, you are giving up your Amer-
ican heritage of freedom. , A

If you're so sure the Committee is only

after "Communists,” why should you ex-

change the American way of life for the un-
American way of paralysis and silence
through fear?

Maybe the Committee is not primarily
after "Communists” at all? Maybe it's after
YOU?

Maybe it wants to silence and paralyze
you?

Maybe it’: succeeding. . . P

Maybe you are working actively for peace
on earth, and you are afraid you may be
prosecuted, as the great Negro scholar
W. E. B. DuBois was prosecuted, as an
"agent of a foreign power?” Evenithough
you were acquitted, as he was, it would cost
you months of your time and thousands of

‘dollars to defend yourself in court. ’

....5_.

"reds” are the

 

Maybe you are a public worker, subject to
a "loyalty check” or oath, and you are afraid
of being ﬁred for "disloyalty” or of losing
your tenure if you sign a petition for peace.
In Madison, Wis, only one out of 112 per-
sons dared to subscribe to a statement com-
osed of extracts from the Declaration of
landependence and the Bill of Rights. (3)

Maybe you are a Mexican-American with
vivid memories of police brutality against
your people on Bloody Christmas (4), and
you are afraid of retaliations if you demand
a clean-up of sadists in the Police Depart-
ment. '

Maybe you are a Negro, and you are afraid
your home may be bombed (as they have
been in Los Angeles and other cities) (5) if
you help break down Jim Crow by buying
property in a "lily white” neighborhood.

Maybe you are a lawyer, like the one
mentioned in the Un-American Committee
hearing of Jan. 25, 1952, who "I know was
never a Communist,” yet

"he stated to me that, as a professional
matter, he would be afraid to represent any-
one before the committee . . . He stated that
he was afraid . . .it would tend to create
the impression that he may be connected

somehow or other with the Communist
movement.” (6)

Maybe you have seen people just like you
being smeared as "subversives" or even pros-
ecuted for their thoughts and beliefs. And
so, although you are utterly innocent of any
crime, you are afraid.

OUR L. A.

"From being a town witb two-way
street: wbere peo le could go in and
out ofall .rort.r o traﬁic, it is now be-
coming a town of one-way street: witb
'No Le t Turn!’ on every corner.”-—
Frank cully. (7)

Of all the cities in the United States, Our
L. A. has been the most fr uently smeared,
the most thoroughly exploiteecd for sensational
headlines, by the publicity-seeking un-Amer-
ican Activities Committee. As Mr. Geor e
Willner said, in a statement su pressed y
the un-Americans, our town has een turned
into

"a place of terror. . .a community where
brother is turned against brother, friend
against friend; a place where the ring of a

telephone or a knock on the door has be-
come an ominous sound." (8)

In Hollywood not only witnesses hostile to
the Un-American Committee are bein black- _
listed, but also subpoenaed persons w o baa:
not yet been beard — and even anyone “who

mig t be subpoenaed”— is being forbidden
employment! (9)

By the time of the 1952 hearings attorney
I. Allan Frankel was testifying that:

"the motion picture industry has gone on
the rocks because they don't dare express a
decent idea . . . because of this committee
. . . I have ben practicing here for 47 years,

and . . . I have been discussing this com- .

mittee with hundreds of lawyers. More than
half of them agree with what I am saying
to you, but they don't dare express it in
any way" (10)

—— obviously for fear of being sub aed
themselves. As for the teachers, Rohzftn M.
Hutchins of the Ford Foundation, formerly
Chancellor of Chicago University, reports
that:

"The academic profession is already petri-
ﬁed ——- nearly frightened to death . . . [Re-
member the teacher] in a dairying state
who was dismissed for saying a good word
for oleomargarine." (11)

The Committee's decision to hunt witches ,
in the ﬁeld of health, as Dr. Thomas L‘. -

Perry, ]r., pointed out,

"can only endanger the high standards of
my profession and endanger the uality of
medical care given to the people of Los An-
geles." (12)

Dr. Jacob B. Druckman, the psychiatrist,
s elled out the effect of the Committee on
t e community this way:
"The basis for the mental health and physi-
cal health of the community lies in the full-
est degree of conﬁdence that people have in
their physicians. . . . Brin ing me here today
. . . raises doubt, fear an insecurity in the
minds of the community, not only in regard
to me but in regard to all doctors." (13)

In Los Angeles, non-citizen residents of
more than 30 years’ standing, against whom
no charges have ever been brought revi-
ously, have suddenly been faced with epor-
tation as "undesirables.”

A psychiatric patient abandoned his analy-
sis in the middle after his doctor testiﬁed be-
fore the un-Americans. He was a federal em-
ployee, and he explained he had been warned
that unless he quit, his professional associa-
tion with the doctor would be made known
—— and he would be ﬁred as "disloyal.”

In a recent custody case, children were
taken from their competent and devoted

mother and turned over to an obviously unﬁt
father, on the ground that the mother had
written them letters deploring the Korean
war.
A mother took a child out of a nursery
school where she was adjusted and happy,
because her teacher's husband was rumored
to have been sub oenaed by the Un-Ameri-
can Committee. e rumor turned out to
be false. The child was miserable in her
new school. -

You are deprived of the enjoyment of sev-

eral hundred entertainers on radio, TV and
films, because they havebeen labelled "sub-
versive’ by stoolpigeons.
A City Council hearing on the alleged sub-
versive oreign inﬂuence of UNESCO in our
school system degenerated into a near-riot
starring the same hysterical councilman who
had opposed housing. Proponents of the Unit-
ed Nations were decried as reds. UNESCO
has since been virtually banished from L.A.’s
schools. (14)

In 1949 a local university hired a teacher
who had made clear she would not discuss
her political beliefs. In 1952 they ﬁred her
——for refusing to discuss her political beliefs.

Recently a group of traﬂic violators, lec-
tured by a police oﬂicer, complained that
some cops were mean to motorists. The oili-
cer scowled. “Oh,” he said, “so you’re Com-
mics, huh?” The complaints were immedi-
ately silenced.

No ambition is too large, no malice too
small to profit by the red bogey. It is trotted
out to eliminate a business competitor, a o-
litical opponent, a rival talent; to squellch
resistance to high prices or war-promoting
movies or Jim Crow se regation; to intimi-
date demands for ﬂoo control or public

Adolf Hitler prophesied in Mein Kampf:
'Those nations pro essing to fear our
methods most wil soon be closely
imitating those methods.”

While civil rights were being blacked out
one by one in Germany “in order to foil the
Jewish-Bolshevik plot against the Reic ,”
Americans were exclaiming, "Can't the Ger-
man eople see through that Big Lie? Don't
they ow what's happening to them? Why
don't they do something to stop it before it's
too late?"

“BY THEIR Wonxs
Y1: SHALL KNOW THEM”

"The people who were being [sub-
poenaed] were precisely those who
haoe been courageous enough to under-
take the defense of un o ular causes,
and . . . the tendency of’) t ese hearings
would inevitably he to discourage peo-
ple from handling [such] cases . . . at
this time, when we think that there is a
reater need than at any time in history
for lawyers to come to the defense of

STEIN, Exec. Sec., National -Lawyers
Guild. (15) I

In spite of the em hasis the un-Americans
place on words ( ought and opinions),
deeds are still man’s most reliable guide to
man. And in the realm of deeds, the honest
observer has long remarked thestartling con-
trast between the Committee and their vic-
tims.

Among the Committeemen, present or re- _

cent, have been:

JOHN S. Woon, D., GA., Chairman till
1953; southern reactionary; voted against
investigatin the Ku Klux Klan because it
was "an ol American custom."

Down.» L. JACKSON, R., CAI.IF.; ex-press
agent; called by one witness "the force and
violence Congressman" (16) because he
frequently insults witnesses (17) and once
claimed he had to be restrained from as-
saulting a witness physically (18); he is
the most vocal Committeeman in regretting
that witnesses are protected from him by
the Fifth Amendment. (19)

CLYDE Dovuz, D., CAI.IF.; ex-liberal who
used to oppose the Committee in Congress;

_7._

(20) now helps blacklist those who oppose
it; the Committee’s velvet glove who fre-
quently reveals the iron ﬁst beneath——as

A when he advised a Canadian witness to go
back where he came from. (21)
Fmmcns E. Warren, D., PA.; co-sponsor of
the McCarran-\Walter Immigration Act that
has infuriated all Europe; lately Chairman
of the House Immigration Committee; con-
cerned with building and maintaining con-
centration camps in the United Sutes. (22)
HAROLD H. Vsunz, R., 0.; ex-FBI man; ex-
prosecuti attorney; now Committee Chair-
man; an or of a book-branding bill in
Congress, so far defeated. (23)

By contract, the witneue: who deﬁed them
were men and women who, in their ﬁelds,
had taken the mart progreuiee positions.

The lawyers among them had defended
the defenseless from the assaults of bigotry;
they had fou ht against thought-control de-
crees and m iaeval urgative oaths; they had
led the ﬁght abolisging the ghetto segrega-
tions of restrictive covenants; and they had
labored mightily to hold back an avalanche
of such palaeolithic legislation as the Burn_s
and Tenney bills which would impose lit-

‘ical qualiﬁcations for the practising 0 any

profession.

The doctors had joined them in that ﬁght;
and in their own medical ﬁeld they had most
cogently advocated national health insurance,

demanded hospitals instead of H-bombs, bat-
tled against antisemitism and for equal op-
portunities for Negro doctors and patients
and technical workers in clinics, medical
schools, etc.

As for the members of the entertainment
professions, it cannot be forgotten that the

rst talents to be persecuted by the un-Amer-

"'. . . Thir committee. . . is the big est

The House Committee on Un-American
Activities was created in 1958 with the os-
tensible purpose of investigating "the extent,
character and objects of un-American pr-opa.
ganda."

Actually, £rom its inception the Committee
fanatically strove to reverse the progressive
trends set in motion by the New Deal both
at home and abroad. '

Karl Mundt (now Senator) let the cat out

01: the bag when he boasted a few years later
t at:

“If any one man in America has set the
standards for this committee, it is John W.
Davis._. . . [He] sent me at my request...
an advisory letter . . . in which he counselled
our_ comnuttee, suggesting the procedures
which we follow; and we have tried to
carry them out faithfully and well." (29)

Mr. Davis was, of course, attorney for J. P.
Morgan. So it was the biggest of big busi-
ness, according to Committeeman Mundt,
that devised the methods by which perfectly
legal activities could be condemned without
trial as “subversive” or even "treasonable.”

The hypocrisy of this procedure was not
lost on certain progressive Congressmen.
Maury Maverick objected that:

 what is [meant by] un-

——ALIcE IN WONDERLAND

Rep. Coffee called the projected “investiga-

tion”
"a smelling ex edition aimed at liberal or-
ganizations in e U.S.A." (31)

The ﬁrst targets of the Committee were
the trade unions and the most progressive in-
dividuals in the New Deal administration.
Rep. Lee Geyer, observing the early un-
American activities of the Committee, proph-
esied that unless it were abolished it would

"spread mutual distrust and fear among the
common people of America; create a war
hysteria; disrupt and destroy progressive
organizations through which the people
seek to solve their problems of jobs, secur-
ity, wages and living standards; weaken
trade unions; hobble the minds of students,
and muzzle their teachers." ( 32)

Events have amply conﬁrmed his prognosis.

The methods of the Committee have been
more generally condemned even than .its
aims. Recently, Wm. T. Gossett, Vice Presi-
dent and General Counsel of the Ford Motor
Co., observed that investigations by legisla-
tive committees tend to

"assume the aspects of a trial and thus
abridge the rights of individuals . . . Wit-
nesses have been exposed to such penalties
as dismissal from their jobs, loss of pen-
sion payments, character assassination. . . .
The committee has the ower to sully a
man's reputation unmerci ully, . . . can send
a witness to jail for refusal to answer a
question—even one which a’ court might
not require him to answer. . . . Committee
members can and do slander witnesses with
impunity, secure in the knowledge that
there can be no'retaliation in court." (33)

Worse still, according to Mr. Gossett:

"In such an inquiry there is no assumption
that the individual is innocent until proved
guilty. There are none of the safeguards of
a trial, to which, by the Constitution and
