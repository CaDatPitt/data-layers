CHRISTIAN PACIFIST FAITH

-—An Aiiirmation

What direction can he found in the Gospel
for the Christian and the Church today when
they are faced once more with the prospect
of imminent war? The following statement is
an attemzit to formulate the answer given by
Christian paciﬂst faith. It was drawn up by
the original group brought together in New
York by the Ministers’ Peace Covenant. As it
appears here it is the result of a long traces:
of discussion and careful revision. Its sponsors
hate it will serve as a medium which will
strengthen Christian faith in the power of
good as found in the Cross to overcome evil
as represented in war. To enlarge this Chris-
tian witness, they invite you to add your name
to the "First 100” signers.

WE believe that God is the Father of all man-

kind, that His will as revealed in Jesus
Christ is universal love, and that Christ's gospel
involves the faith that evil can be overcome only
with good.

We believe that in the Cross is revealed God's
way of dealing with wrongdoers, and that to
this way all Christians are called.

We believe that war, which attempts to over-
come evil with more evil, is a denial of the way
of the Cross.

We believe that the Church is called to the
way of the Cross.

We believe that when the state in the prosecu-
tion of war seeks to compel the denial of the
gospel, the Church must resist at whatever cost.

We believe that God leads his church into
new life through obedience of the individual
believer in refusing war for Christ's sake.

Therefore we proclaim to a world which is
once again madly preparing for war that the
gospel of God as revealed in Jesus Christ, which
leaves us with no other choice but to refuse

3

to sanction or articipate in war, contains also
its hope of re emption. We aﬂirm our faith
that the mission of the church today is to witness
with singleness of heart, at whatever cost, to
the power of good to overcome evil, of love to
conquer hatred, of the Cross to shatter the
sword.

(The seven paragraphs above are a brief sum-
mary of the important statement which follows.
Together these pages present an Aﬂirmation of
Faith which we invite all whose convictions are
here expressed to sign.)

S believers in the gospel of God as revealed

in Jesus Christ, we hold that good is the
only force which can overcome evil. Therefore
we are paciﬁsts, for the paciﬁst is one who in the
face of hatred and war puts to the test of action
the faith that the nature of God as universal
love makes certain that evil must yield to good.
War, whether aggressive or defensive, whether
waged for a "just” or an “unjust” cause, attempts
to overcome evil with more evil. We identify
ourselves with the judgment uttered by the Ox-
ford World Conference of Churches, “Wu
involves compulsory enmity, diabolical outrage
against human personality, and a wanton distor-
tion of the truth. War is a particular demon-
stration of the power of sin in this world, and a
deﬁance of the righteousness of God as revealed
in Jesus Christ and him cruciﬁed.” It is there-
fore for us as followers of Jesus Christ morally
and spiritually impossible. This conviction does
not originate in any political situation. It does
not emerge out of any doctrinaire opinion that
force is always wrong. It is not caused by a
sentimental horror of bloodshed. It is simply
our conviction that the gospel of Jesus Christ
involves commitment to the faith that evil can
only be overcome with good. If we are mis-
taken in this we have misunderstood the gospel.

4

This conviction arises from the Cross, where
we see Godfs way of dealing with wrongdoers.
In the face of violence, Jesus Christ turned away
from retaliation and violent resistance. Life and
property were secondary values to Him. The
primary question was for Him and must be for
us, How can the evil man be redeemed and
brought into a just and friendly relationship
to God and man? This redemptive purpose in-
volved the choice of the Cross. Sacriﬁcing not
only His personal safety but that of His friends
and even of His cause, He won for them all
immortality. Non-violent, forgiving love alone
reconciles man to God and man to man. For
us as well as for Jesus, to choose this way re-
quires that we must also choose to accept what-
ever suﬂering it involves. Therefore we be-
lieve that all Christians are called to live the
way of the Cross today.

War Denies Way of Cross

War and preparations for war constitute a
denial of the way of the Cross for they attempt
to overcome evil with more evil.
believe that the Christian, whose every act must
accord with his supreme loyalty to the God of
love, can ever in the name of Christ drop bombs
on helpless women and children, which is a
characteristic act of modern war, or on any of
his brothers, whether soldiers or civilians. Since
the method of war does not vary in accordance
with its purpose, whether defensive or other-
wise, we cannot believe that any kind of war is
truly redemptive. The tragic dilemmas which
confront humanity today because nations still
trust the way of selfishness and war cannot be
resolved by pointing at others as guilty, or by
attempting to visit judgment upon the trans-
gressors. We have all sinned and come short
of the destiny to which God has called us. The

5

We cannot A

Cross convicts us of our own guilt and demands
that we make restitution even to the point where
we penitently bear suffering for our own and
our brothers’ sins. Only thus, we believe, can
the vicious circle of war leading to more war be
broken and a permanently peaceful international
order be established. If the suffering love of
the Cross is not for us the concrete and living
alternative to the inﬂiction of suffering in hatred
on others in war, if it does not today constitute
for us the basis for a lively hope of overcoming
war, then it seems to us that we have rejected
Christ not only as a moral guide for humanity
but also as the Saviour of the world.

Church Called to Christ's Way

We believe that the church as well as the
Christian is called to the way of the Cross. It
is the body of Christ and is created by His spirit
to carry on His redemptive work. The church
belongs to Christ and is not de endent on any
other power. False concern or institutional
welfare sometimes makes the church forget that
her sole guide is the life and teachings of her

Master. The irnminence of the universal death,"

destruction and hatred of world-wide war, how-
ever, requires that the church repent and set her
house in order for a day of great trial and the
privilege of participating in cosmic processes of
redemption which may yet save the world from
destruction. Her only commission is to witness
in words and deeds to Christ’s way which is the
way of the Cross. Refusal at whatever cost to
abandon its ministry of reconciliation is itself a
deed of constructive witness to the gospel.
Today no greater challenge to the way of the
Cross lies before the church than in her relations
with the State. Centuries of effort to build
civilization on a secular basis and feverish poli-

cies or armament and empire have brought the 4‘;

state today to the place where increasingly it is
claiming absolute power. To unify and prepare
itself for war it attempts to assume control not
only of the bodies, but also of the consciences
of men. The church cannot tolerate having the
state become an authority in the moral realm.
Under no circumstances can it grant to the State
the right to claim from Christians the supreme
loyalty which belongs only to God. Being con-
cerned with eternal values the church must chal-
lenge the temporal concerns of the state and
stand in judgment upon it whenever it violates,
or commands Christians who may be its citizens
to violate the love of God or the brotherhood
of man. This already has come to mean persecu-
tion, and it will yet involve even more, but the
church has no more right to expect exemption
from suffering than her Lord.

Way Always Open

The church will discover new truth and fresh
power through the obedience of the individual
church member to his Lord. The way of Christ
is always open and the need for a living witness
in faith was never greater than today. The
Christian is never shut u to a situation in which
he has no choice but to 0 wrong. Wars come,
but Christians need not take part in them and
thus on command of the State commit sin against
their primary allegiance to God. On the other
hand the inesca able pervasiveness and immi-
nence of war 0 ers opportunity for witness to
the way of love on such a scale that through
God's grace incalculable inﬂuences for peace
may even now be loosed by courageous and
faithful loyalty at whatever cost.

We stand at a crisis in history where the most
solemn responsibility rests upon each Christian
and upon the Christian church. In such an hour
we call upon the church to trust God and to
resist evil only with good, repudiating utterly

7

 

all war and repenting prayerfully of all ways
of life which lead to war, accepting the full cost
and responsibility of the Cross. If this involves
persecution by the Caesars of our day, we call
upon the Church to enter into dee er fellowship
with that Church which refuse to serve in
Caesar’s armies, and to invite into its unbreak-
able spiritual community the men and Women
of all lands who pray night and day for peace.
In contrition and deep faith, we reaﬂirm our
undivided loyalty to the universal God of love
and to the Church of Him who refused to be
Caesar or to overcome Caesar with Caesar’s
weapons. We proclaim to a world which is
once again madly preparing for war that the
gospel of God as revealed in Jesus Christ, which
leaves us with no other choice but to refuse to
sanction or participate in war, contains also its
hope of redemption. We declare our conviction
that the mission of the church today is to witness
with singleness of heart at whatever cost to the
power of good to overcome evil, of love to
conquer hatred, of the Cross to shatter the sword.
