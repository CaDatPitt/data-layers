President Johnson Signs

 Measure on September 16  

WASHINGTON, D.C.—-President Johnson on Sept.

16 sign

led into law the Metal and Nonmetallic’ Mine

Safety Act of 1966, calling the measure “a proud addi-
tion” to the legislative record of the 89th Congress. Its ,_
enactment, he said, “will afford far greater protection .
to one important segment of American labor which has ,
been denied sorely needed protection.” . . I

In attendance at the bill-signing ceremonies at the

-».-Wliite House, Mine-Mill President A. C. Skinner. hailed f

the action and credited, the bill’s passage to a determined
and unified labor movement campaign to bring to the
attention of the-public and the Congress the “shockingly

high injury and fatality rates over the years in

ferrous metals industry.”

the non-

, The first pen used in the signing of the act was pre-
sented to Sen. Lee Metcalf (D-Mont.), Whose first bill
as a freshman Congressman in 1953 was a proposal for
federal mine safety legislation. Metcalf, who continued ~ .

to be a leader in the fight
through this year’s legislative
victory, later awarded the pen
to the Butte Miners‘Union, Mine-
Mill Local 1, which, he pointed
out, was in the forefront of the
struggle over the years.

250.000 Workers’ Covered

’ The mine safety act, approved
by the House of Representatives
last year on a voice vote and by
a 57 to 18 Senate roll-call on
June 23, will extend federal
health and safety standards to
some 250,000 workers in metal.
and mineral underground and

, open pit mines, mills, -quarries,
and sand and gravel pits. Penal-
ties are provided for the failure
by mine operators to comply
with orders, including’ those to
shut down a property, by the

Secretary,-of the Interior to cor-

rect -conditions that dotnot meet“

mandatory . standards.

Pointing out that thejwork “is
hard and it is dangerous,”
President Johnson said that “for
too many years, this industry
has been gravely deficient in
safety practices.” He noted the
results in human lives and suf-
fering—181 workers killed in
1965 and nearly’ 12,000" others,

' nearly five percent of those em-

ployed "in the industry, injured
seriously enough to lose time
fromytheir jobs.

The Presidentstated that the

bill “closes a serious gap” in

Wage Hike of 29 Cents/Hour
Included in N.J. Zinc Pact

BAYARD, N. M.———The New Jersey Zinc unit of Mine-Mill Local 890 recently won
a new three-year contract with the company, effective this.Sept. 1, which provides 29

cents per hour in across-the
nation of the employee’s con

-board wage boosts. Also included in the pact are elimi-
tribution to the group insurance program, vacation and
-pension improvements, increased shift differentials, and many other gains.

The contract was ratified unanimously on Sept. 10. About 120 of the some 150
workers covered by the agreement were ‘present at the ratification meeting.
The wage increases, taking effect on Sept. 1 this year, in 1967, and in 1968, are

12, 8, and 9 cents per hour.

Pension Improvements

Effective immediately is a
new pension program that pro-
vides for vesting at age. 45 after
15 years of service, for early re-
tirement at age 55 with 15 years
of service, and for disability
pensions at age 45 with 15 years
of service.

A basic monthly pension of $3
per year of service will be sup-
plemented by an amount equal
to 1% percent of the average
monthly e a r n in g s over $400
times the number of years of
service. Thus, for example, a
worker with 30 years of service,
who has averaged‘$500 per-
month, wo'-.:ici receive a monthly

.. -pension of $127.50 [$3 x 30 =
. $90] + [(114%) ($100) (30) ‘=

$37.50]. ,

The contract specifies that
there will be no offsetting for
Social Security payments. Fur-
ther, a widow's pension benefit,
equal to 40 percent of the nor-
mal pension, was won.

Effective during the first year
of the agreement are vacation
improvements calling for two
weeks after three years of ser-
vice; three weeks after 10
years; and four weeks after 25
years. Jury duty pay, providing
the difference between the jury
duty allowance and plant pay,
and up to three days of funeral
pay also take effect immediate-
ly. Life insurance is increased
from $3,500 to $4,500.

Second Year Gains

The contract’s second year
provides, in addition to the wage
hike, increases in shift differen-
tials, making them 9, 10, and 12
cents per hour; improvements
in the weekly sickness and ac-
cident benefit, making it $43
to $58 depending on the worker’s
earnings; and double-time-and-
a-halfrfor holidays worked.

Additionally, New Jersey Zinc
will pick up the entire employee
contribution to the group insur-
ance program, which is now
about $17.50 per month, and
agrees to pay, too, for any fu-
ture cost increases in the pro-
gram.

Among the many language

- improvements in the new con-

tract, which will expire on.Dec.
1, 1969, "are a strengthened griev-
ance procedure, including a pro-
vision for a hearing ‘before any
worker can be discharged, im-
proved clauses on holiday pay

and on no foremen working,
stronger maintenance of mem-
bership and check-off provisions,
and a section requiring notifica-
tion to the union of all depart-
mental and inter-departmental
job posting and the disposition
of such bids.

26iCl1i|dren Orphaned by
Two El Paso Fatalities  

EL PASO, Texas—Two fatali-
ties at the American Smelting
and Refining Company plant
here in little over a month have
left 26 children fatherless. Fran-
cisco Gonzales and Victor M.
Huertado, both members of
Mine-Mill Local 509,‘ the El Paso
Smelter Workers Union, were
killed in accidents on Aug. 11
and Sept. 15 respectively. -

Gonzales, a holding furnace-
man, died with first, second,
and third degree burns over 70
percent of his body as the re-
sultaof an explosion or erup-
tion of copper matte from the
copper reverberatory furnace,
in the course ofwhich he was
struck with molten matte.

Although the cause of the ex-

' plosion could not be determined

by a company-union investiga-
tiVe teem, part ‘of the charge

in the furnace at the time was
a concentrate of copper oxide. It
was agreed that the copper
oxide in the future will ‘be
smelted separately in the lead

‘ department.

Gonzales, 49, who had 15

years of seniority at the prop-
erty, Ieaves his widow and 13

children.

There were no witnesses to
the accident causing the death
of Huertado,. 43, a locomotive
switchman, who was run over
in the yard at 4:30 a.m. It had

been raining, and it was felt that ,

he might have slipped on the
wet platform at the rear of the

~ locomotive, falling on the right

of way and‘ being run over by
the following car.

Huertado, who had 11 years’
seniority in the plant, leaves
his widow, six children, and
seven adopted children. i

Stephen W. Trosko 

0f Local 837 Dies

CARTERET, N.J.——Stephen w. Trosko, who was instrumental-
in establishing Mine-Mill Local 837 in 1945 and served in many
leadership roles with the local union since that time, died inhis

sleep on Sept. 26.

Born in July, 1908, he became a well-known figure in this com- 
munity because of his involvement in civic and political affairs in ‘

addition to his union activities.
People from all walks of life at-
tended funeral services on Sept.
29.

Prior to 1945, there were a
number of different unions at the
U.S. Metals plant here, including
an early company union and an
AFL union. Trosko was active
at that time and was a member
of the group that fought for
Mine-Mill bargaining rights at
the property.

First elected president of the
Carteret Smelter and Refinery
Workers Union in 1947, Trosko
served until 1950, when he be-
came ill and was forced to drop
his activities for a few years.

Returning to the plant about
1955, he immediately resumed
his interest in the union. From
that time until his death, he was
in the local leadership in one
position or another.

Grievance chairman from 1957
to 1960, Trosko was again elect-
ed president in 1962. He served
until 1964 in that capacity, dur-
ing which time the local had
erected and dedicated a new
hall — one of the finest such
buildings in the East.

Trosko served, too, as chair-

 

Stephen Trosko
Headed Carteret Local

man of the Labor Carteret Coun-
cil for a number of years and
was its political action chairman
last year.

A delegate to many Mine-Mill P
conventions, Trosko had many
friends throughout the interna-
tional union. No single Local .837
leader remained active so long
as the colorful figure from Car-
teret. Trosko will be missed by
Mine-Mill. '

I R Does Your Vote (Count?

Undoubtedly you’re planning on voting on Nov. 8, but how
many times in the past have similar plans been changed when
something else came up? The typical excuse is that “one vote
won’t make any difference anyway.” What’s the truth of that
statement? Just how important is one vote—your vote?

The fact of the matter is, on several occasions, the course of
history has been changed by a single vote.

*k*k*

Most Americans today take
the English language pretty
much for granted. But for one
vote, however,
language of this country would
have been German. Anti-British
feelings were so strong during
the Revolution that a bill was
introduced in Congress to
change the official language
from ‘English to German. The
bill was defeated by one vote.

*‘A'*

The difference of a single vote
may well have been responsible
for World War II, which resulted
in atrocities that will never be
forgotten. A group of leaders
of the Nazi "Party met in a beer
hall in 1923 and, by one vote,
elected their leader — Adolph

Hitler.
* *

Marcus Morton ran for Gov-
ernor of Massachusetts in 1839
and needed a majority of 51,034
votes to win. He received ex-
actly that number. Had one of
those persons failed to vote,
there would have been a differ-
ent governor.

*‘k‘k

Texas was nearly denied
statehood in 1845 because of a
26 to 26 tie vote in the U. S.
Senate._ The deadlocked tally
was broken when Senator Han-
negan of Indiana changed his
vote to favor admission of
Texas to the Union. Ironically,
Hanneganihimself had been
elected to Congress by one vote.

‘k**

A person even lost his head
over one vote. In 1649, Charles
I of England was beheaded
after a tribunal of judges voted
68.to 67 in favor of the decapi-

tation. .
* ‘Ir

Two American presidents; have
either retained. or gained office’
because of a.one-vote margin.
In 1868, President Andrew John-
son narrowly escaped removal
from office, when the US. Sen-

th e official‘

ate vote of 35 to 19 fell one vote
short of the necessary two-thirds
majority required to approve
impeachment. Senator James
W. Grimes of Iowa, who was ill
and had to be helped into the
Senate chambers, provided the
decisive vote. .

‘A’ ‘Ir ‘k
Eight years later, Rutherford
B. Hayes became the 19th pres-

ident of the United States, win-
ning by an electoral vote of 185

to 1s4._

THE MINE-MILL UNION

United Steelworkers Chart New Course Griner Seeks
At September Atlantic City Convention Mine Inspector’:

Atlantic City, N. J .—-The recently concluded convention of the United Steelworkers of America marked a turn-
ing point in the history of the organization. It was a democratic convention which raised the banner of a -guaranteed
annual wage with complete job security for all workers, created new machinery for greater rank-and-file participa-
tion and more flexibility in bargaining with the employers, and approved the mutual assistance pact and the potential
merger with the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers.

In addition, the convention was a vote of confidence in the new leadership of the union—-headed by President
I. W. Abel, Vice-President Joseph Molony, and Secretary-Treasurer Walter Burke. The convention, which met from
Sept. 19 to 23 and was the largest in the history of the Steelworkers, overwhelmingly supported every major objec-

tive proposed by a united lead-
ership.

The convention voted ‘to set
up new bargaining machinery
of particular importance to the
workers in the non-ferrous met-

/"als industry. The old wage pol-

Icy committee, which formerly
‘had the power to ratify, reject,
-and extend agreements and to
call and terminate strikes, has
now become more of an advis-
ory body. The powers formerly
held by the wage policy commit-
tee have been given to four
newly created industry confer-
ences—and to the membership.
The rank and file confer-

ences--in basic steel, non-fer-

rous metals, aluminum, and can
——will call the shots’ for bar-
gaining in each of these indus-
tries. No strike will be called
without a vote of the member-
ship.
Bargaining Objectives
In a resolution spelling out

' m a j o r bargaining objectives,

the delegates adopted the fol-

. lowing program:

i O A comprehensive solution
to all‘ problems affecting a.
worker, his family, and his
community when technologi-
cal progress threatens to dis-
rupt existing, establishcﬁl pat-
terns of living;
I Full achievement of the

.. guaranteed annual wage, in-

._.}*‘

cluding conversion of hourly
wage rates to monthly sal-
aries, together with lifetime
job security for qualified em-
ployes;

O The right of workers to
participate in stock option
plans and other fringe bene-
fits now available only to top
management;

0 The focusing of bargain-
ing efforts on contracting
out, cost-of-living provisions,
increased premium pay for
overtime, holidays, shift work
and. weekends, substantial
wage improvements, restraints
on -foremen performing bar-
gaining unit work, improved
regular and extended vaca-
tions-, and a host of other
items.

The convention unanimously
approved the mutual assistance
pact signed late in August by
the international officers of the
United Steelworkers and Mine-
Mill, and authorized the Steel-
workers’ executive board to
complete merger negotiations.
The combined membership upon
merger of the two unions in
non-ferrous metals will be over
100,000 workers.

" One ,of the highlights of the
convention was the speech by
Walter Reuther, president of the

United Auto Workers, who

. placed direct responsibility for

the present inflationary spiral
on the enormous profits of in-

_ dustry. Addressing a Steelwork-

ers convention for the first time
s'nce 1949, he pledged close co-
operation between the UAW and

A" the Steelworkers on all levels of

activity-cooperation so close as
to ‘be just short of merger.
Among the trade union speak-

U , ers and guests at the conven-
 tion were A. Philip Randolph,
 president of the Brotherhood of

Sleeping Car Porters, and more
than 100 trade unionists from 17

‘ different countries, among them -
_tm ,m1ners from Bolivia and

metal. miners from other South

‘ V -, American, countries.

In addition, the delegates

~-heard major ,t_a'lks by‘ Vice-

Keynote Address

Perhaps the most striking as-
pect of the convention was the
extensive rank-and-file partici-
pation which was touched off by

    

I. W. Abel
Steelworkers President

the keynote address of Presi-
dent Abel, when he asserted
that the Steelworkers union
“does not belong to me or to
any other officer.”

“It does not belong to any
director,” he continued,
does not belong to any staff
representatives or any group of

For many years, both our union and the Interna-

tional Union of Mine, Mill

and Smelter Workers have

exercised jurisdiction over workers in the non-ferrous
metals industries. The overlapping jurisdictions have led
to wasteful disputes and contests which have diverted
both unions from the uninterrupted pursuit of their com-
mon goal: the advancement of the well-being of non-fer-

rous workers.

We are pleased by the signs that these two unions

are now prepared to march

together in the accomplisl1-

ment of their great tasks. We applaud, and endorse, the
mutual assistance pact which our officers, upon authori-
zation of the international executive board, have negoti-
ated with Mine-Mill, covering membership in the United

States.

This pact is a healthy beginning. That beginning
should be nurtured, so that ever-closer ties may bind our
two unions into a unified effective force. The combined

talents of these two unions

would provide even greater

services and benefits to all non-ferrous workers. To that
end, we urge and authorize the international officers and
international executive board to take all necessary and
appropriate steps to accomplish the affiliation of Mine-
Mill and its local unions with our union at the earliest

practicable date.

At Buffalo local

BUFFALO, N.Y.—Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Jr., the Liberal par-
ty’s gubernatorial candidate in
New York, scheduled to speak
at the Mine-Mill Local 593 hall
here on Oct. 6, as this issue of
the Mine-Mill Union was going
to press, was expected to attract
a full house of better than 200
union members and their
friends.

The son of the late President,
Roosevelt has been hammering
away at “bossism” in both the
Democratic and Republican par-
ties of the state during the cam-
paign. He is running against Nel-
son Rockefeller, the incumbent
Republican governor, who is

seeking a third term, and Frank ,

D. 0’Connor, the president of the
New York City Council, who is
the Democratic standard-bearer.

The Liberal party traditionally
during its 22-year history has
supported the Democratic guber-
natorial candidate, but split
away this year over the “boss-
ism” charges.

A former Congressman, Roose-
velt served as Under Secretary
of Commerce under the late
President Kennedy and more re-
cently was chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.

Refreshments were to be
served following the meeting.

Civil Rights Action

Local 593 President Pat Pa-
cile, in a separate action last
month, participated in a march
sponsored by many community,
civil rights, religious organiza-
tions and trade unions to alert
federal and state agencies con-
cerning their responsibility in
ensuring that a representative
number of non-whites are em-
ployed during the current_boom
in -building. ‘

The agencies deal with con-
tractors, who in turn should be
advising unions to open their
apprenticeship programs to non-
whites. ‘ ‘

The orderly demonstration as-
sembled at the JFK Center, and
visited four building sites in
downtown Buffalo. About 800
persons tookpart, including
Mine-Mill Vice-President Asbury

«Howard and International Rep-

resentative Joseph C. Scioli.

Post in Idaho

Carl Griner", a member of the
Coeur d’Alene District Miners’
and Smeltermen’s Union, Mine-
Mill Local 18, will have the
backing of labor in Idaho in his
battle to unseat 0. T. Hanson
as state mine inspector on Nov.
8. Endorsed early both by his
own local and by Local 5114 of
the United Steelworkers, he was
unopposed in the Democratic
primary election on Aug. 2.

The race will provide the ma--
jor focus for the Mine-Mill local,
as three other Local 18 mem-
bers were defeatedin the pri-
mary—Ray 'Nieland, who was

seeking a seat in the legislature, ‘

and Elmer DuPuis and June
Lawley, Democratic candidates
for county commissioner.

Gubernatorial Race

Mine-Mill also is expected to
support State Sen. Cecil Andrus
in the gubernatorial contest,
which was thrown into confusion
last month by the death of

Carnes Herndo-n, the original V

Democratic nominee, in a plane
crash. Andrus, who has been
endorsed by the state's AFL-
CIO, had been the primary run-
ner-up and was picked to re-
place Herndon on the ticket. He
will face conservative Don Sam-
uelson, who dumped the incum-
bent governor, Robert E. Smy-
lie, in the primary. Smylie was
known as a moderate Repub-
lican.

The situation is further com-
plicated by the campaigns also
under way for two independents
and one write-in candidate.

U. S. Rep. Compton 1. White
(D), who will have Local 18 sup-
port, is expected to be in for a
close race, as are Sen. Len Jor-
dan and Rep. George V. Hensen,
two Republican incumbents up
for re-election.

Griner has pledged to seek
revision and updating of the
Idaho mine safety code, if elect-
ed. A worker at the AS&R Page

mine, he recommends, too, addi- .

tional research into the causes
and prevention of silicosis and
other diseases related to the
mining industry.

In Tacoma, Wash., Mine-Mill
Local 25 is expected to devote
most of its political action work
to the re-election bid of U. S.
Rep. Floyd Hicks~(D).

years are included in a new
contract I settlement reached
last month between the Unit-
ed Steelworkers and the In-
ternational Nickel Company.

The negotiations, which be-
gan over six months ago-and
were marked by a number
of wildcat strikes, the long-

Some 2,000 employees at
Inco’s Port Colborne property»
also approved the settlement.

Retroactive to July 10, the

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 Montana Locals Back Metcalf,
Olsen, Melcher, and Cannon

EAST HELENA, Mont.—-It came as no surprise last month when delegates to the Sept. 17 meet-
ing of the Montana Mine-Mill Legislative Committee formally and unanimously endorsed U.S. Sena-
tor Lee Metcalf in his bid for re-election.

The liberal Democrat, after all, had led the fight in this session’s successful campaign for a fed-
eral mine safety law. In recognition of that leadership, Metcalf received the first pen used by Presi-

cal 1 in Butte. Various members
of the union, too, had been ac-

» tive with the “Labor for Met-
_calf” Committee since it was

formed many months ago.

, Close [lace Seen
1 It is not surprising either that

Metcalf is solidly backed by the

AFL-CIO in Montana and by the
state’s Farmers Union. With in-
cumbent Governor Tim Babcock,

‘ a right-wing conservative backed

by the Montana utility interests,

. as his opponent, Metcalf is in-
volved in a classic liberal vs.’

conservative struggle. Aware of
the resurgence of the far right,

- particularly in the Rocky Mou_n- ’

tain region, the labor movement
nationally sees the Metcalf re-
election bid as one of the really

key struggles in the country.

_ The race is viewed _as a tight
one. - _

The Butte Miners Union, which
this year is working much more
closely with the AFL-ClO’s Com-

has launched a voter registration
drive in Silver Bow County,
where an estimated 8,000 eligible

persons are unregistered. V Con-
centration on locations such as
shopping centers has paid off in
the registration of as many as
350 persons in a week. The local

more adequate numbers of per-

the polls this year. Many voters
became disgusted two years ago
when faced with a wait of an
hour or more, they said, and left
without casting their ballots, due
to the overloading of the polls
when most people got off work.
The Montana Mine-Mill locals,
too, are gearing for a concerted
“get-out-the-vote” drive on Elec-
tion Day, in view of the fact that
in non-presidential election years
the turnout is normally low.

  On the oath oi the Fair
  liousng Bill

by Irving Dichfer
international Secretary-Treasurer

N TUESDAY, SEPT. 13, George P. Mahoney, a perennial!
loser, won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in
Maryland, getting about 30 percent of the total vote, which was
more than that of any of six other candidates. Mahoney had
openly appealed to the “backlash” vote, basing his entire cam-
paign on his opposition to the fair housing section of the federal
civil rights bill. . ‘ ‘ . __  v
Within a week, that bill was dead, as the-U.S. Senate failed ”
to invoke cloture which would have cut off debate on making
the bill the business- of the chamber. -

 

Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (R-Ill.) has been cast as  .

not have killed the bill—already "substantially watered down by  -34"
the House of Representatives. The vote-on cloture was .54 to 42," .
10 votes shy of the necessary two-thirds majority.’ According to" , H
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont), however, the 42
Democrats and 12 Republicans who supported the cloture move.

all could not be counted as supporters of the bill itself. (2
Democrats and’ 21 Republicans opposed cloture.) I ‘

Additional sections of the bill would have prohibited discrimi-

nation in the selection of jurors in federal, state, and local -courts,

have empowered the U. S. Attorney General to bring suit to  
prevent official or. private intimidation of anyperson, _and have,  
prohibited threat or injury to civil rights workers engaged in I --
“lawful” activities. In passing the meas- . ’ «
ure on Aug. 9, however, the House had ,4
excluded some 60 percent of the nation’s
housing from the proposed bias ban, and
further had weakened the bill by specify-
ing that the Attorney General could not
initiate suits to desegregate public schools
or facilities without first receiving a writ-
ten, complaint-of denial of equal protection

In recent years, of course, Congress has

HERE IS A‘ GROWING ATTITUDE inthe .UnitedgStates-that-

Inspiration Co. Announces Shutdown

As Workers Protest Unsafe Conditions

. GLOBE, Ariz.—Hard on the heels of a fatal accident which took the life of Ezequiel Y. Sanchez of Mine-Mill
Local 586 and an ensuing protest walkout by union members, the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company, a
subsidiary of Anaconda, announced on Sept. 29 the closing of its Christmas mine.

Sanchez, a 38-year-old miner who leaves a widow, had 18 years of experience in hard rock mining. His death

A I on Sept. 20 came as the result of a fall of rock which killed him instantly—an accident that the U. S. Bureau of

,Mines says was contributed to by the failure of supervisors and workmen to evaluate properly a dangerous condi-

tion following the removal of
permanent supports.

Poor Safety Record
Local 586 officials report that
the Christmas mine has had a
. bad safety record, and for sev-
.-/wﬁll years the union has pressed
"ix, , ands on the company for
‘ mdre adequate safety measures,
A formore competent supervision,
and for a thorough and com-
plete health and safety inspec-
. tion by the U. "S. Bureau of
I Mines.
‘Ironically, Sanchez’ death
.  came shortly after the company
had agreedto’ a new contract
clause providing for the estab-
lishment of a joint company-
union safety committee to re-
view'working practices and
hazards at the mine. (See story

 f in last month’-s Minei-Mill Union.) '

nor did he instruct Sanchez to

rock,~50” by’ 30", tapering in
 thickness from 4 to 10 inches,
 fell and killed him. - ‘ - ‘ -

about the new «company practice

(See box on Bureau of Mines
report and recommendations.)

Local 586 Proposals
On Sept. 25, the union sub-
mitted to the company a four-

pointproposal for the “remedy- v

-ing of the conditions and prac-
tices at the. Christmas Mine of
Inspiration Consolidated Copper
Company which, in the union’s
view, are responsible for the
high accident rate and the death
of Ezequiel Sanchez.”

The first proposal was for a

joint .request by the union and’

the company to the Secretary of
=_.the Interior fora special, full
-scale inspection of the Christ-
mas; mine by a team of experts,
including a mining engineer and
a- geologist, with -the company
agreeing to abide by the recom-
mendations of the inspectors.
Secondly, the union listed nine
detailed suggested mining prac-
tices to remain in effect until
the federal inspection was LOIl-
cluded, and thereafter, unless
they were in conflict with

Bureau of Mines recommenda-
tions arising from the survey of
the mine. The nine items cov-
ered practices in driving head-
ings, stopes and crosscuts, useof
diesel equipment under ground,
and blasting procedures. In ad-
dition, they spelled out respon-
sibility of supervisors for en-
forcing safe mining practices,
and called for prohibition of the
practice of assigning miners to
work alone where they cannot
be heard or seen by others.

The third major point was a
series of proposals for the func-
tioning of the joint company-
union safety committee.

Finally, the union called for
an investigation into supervisory
responsibility for the practices
which brought about the death
of Sanchez, and for the suspen-
sion and replacement of those
responsible.

Company Statement

The company made no reply
to the proposals for four days.
Then, on Sept. 29, the New York
office issued a quaruious state-
ment complaining that _the
Christmas mine had always
operated at a loss and announc-
ing -that, although’ officials
would meet with the union on
its proposals, they would not
commit themselves to reopening
the Christmas mine until cer-
tain “economic questions” were
resolved. By this, they meant
successful negotiation of a pre-
mium price contract the com-
pany has been attempting to
secure from the government to
subsidize the Christmas opera-
tion. (Later, company officials
announced in Arizona that even

the securing of a subsidy would
not bring about reopening of the

the subsidy might be used to

Noticeably lacking from the
company statement out of New
York was any expression of
regret at Sanchez’: death, or
concern for the safety of its
employees.

The company's“ shutdown
affects 375 employees at the
Christmas mine. It plans to

Taylor-Knapp
Workers Win

Boost in Wages

PHILIPSBURG, Mont. — An

across-the-board wage increase ‘
of 10 cents an hour highlights a ‘

new one-year agreement be-

tween Mine-Mill Local 24 and’

the Taylor-Knapp Mining Com-
pany.

Additionally, effective Sept. 1,
the room and board hospital
benefit was increased from $16
to_$20 a day, while the employ-
ee's contribution to the health
and welfare program was re-
duced by $4.18 a month.

The contract establishes two
new job classifications—diamond
drill operator and diamond drill

helper, who will be paid $23.80 -

and $21.83 per shift respectively.

The wage increase will be
retroactive to Aug. 15, with the
contract expiring on that date
in 1967. A major reason that the
local union negotiating commit-

tee wanted a settlement of only

one year's duration is the possi-
bility of a future price hike in
silver, which would substantially

add to Local 24’s bargaining

strength at the property.

SEPTEMBER 16, 1966 . . . The date marks both an end and a new beginning. President Johnson’s signing that day of the Metal and N on- 
metallic Mines Safety Act brought to a successful conclusion Mine-Mill’s efforts, stretching back over more than a quarter of a century, to secure f * I
’ adoption of federal legislation for the protection of the health and lives of workers in the non-ferrous metals industry. ‘
 Yet, still to be won is a federal mine safety code authorized by the new law, which will spell out the long-denie

the industry can face with
reasonable confidence.

Today Mine-Mill mem-
bers and .. the industry’s
other workers can be proud
of» their achievement in the
passage of the new law,
Won through their continu-
ous pressure over so many
years- It is appropriate now
to recount here a few of the
many highlights of that
long and hard-fought
struggle.

Beginning of Struggle

The story began back in
December, 1940, when
Mine - Mill ’s International
executive board adopted a
resolution calling upon Con-
gress to enact federal safe-

ty legislation for the in--

dustry.
The following year saw
Congress approve the Fed-

_ eral Coal Mine Safety Act,
- covering many more work-

’ ers than were at that time

employed in the non-fer-
rous metals. .
In 1942, Mine-Mill drafted

_ 7 a bill modeled after the re-
. cently enacted Coal Mine

Safety Act, but applicable

"to the mining of ores other

than coal and to the milling
and smelting of such ores.

A‘ With the -country having
. V . been at war for nearly a
, year, however, the bill was

given a low priority.

In the postwar period,
too,’ several years were to
elapse before mine safety
legislation was introduced
in Congress. Such legisla-

' tion was urged on members

of - Congress independently
by both. Mine-Mill and the

,United Steelworkers, and,
as‘ a’ result of these efforts,

the late Sen. James Murray
(D-Mont.) and ‘then fresh-
man Congressman Lee Met-
calf (D-Mont.) in 1953 in-
troduced _identical mine
safetygbills, closely parallel-
ing .Mine-Mill’s p r o p o s e d
bill of 1942,-_ but omitting
coverage of smelters. ‘

‘- _ « — A co-sponsor in the Sen-
ate was Hubert H. Hum-
phrey

(D-Minn.) ,5 w h i l e

‘ Congressman Augustine B.

u

  

 Kelley (D.-Pa.) co-spon-

sored the House bill.

 Referred to the appropri- .
 ate committees in the two

houses; the bills saw no ac-

I  tion‘ taken. They died with

s.;_‘1,:;a‘t.e me _n t‘ indicating the I

     

ﬂat opposition both of his
department and of the Ei-
senhower administration to
the proposed legislation.
With the hearings being
completed too late in 1956
for further action to be
taken on the bill, the sub-
committee recommended
that a new subcommittee be

appointed in the next Con— .

gress to pursue the subject.

Silicosis Study

An important outgrowth
of the 1956 hearings, how-
ever, was a joint study con-

" ducted by the Bureau of

Mines and the U. S. Public
Health Service on “Silicosis
in the Metal Mining Indus-
try.” No national study of
this dread disease of hard
rock miners had been made
since 1940, and a good part
of the hearings had dealt
with the high incidence. of
the disease. Mine-Mill sup-
ported the request for addi-
tional funds for the two
agencies, which was ap-
proved by Congress, and a
(March,

1958 to September, 1961')’

was made of mining meth-
ods and dust disease in the
"metal mining industry. The
results of the study pro-
vided further support for
the union’s position that

federal safety legislation‘

was needed.

Much shorter hearings
were held. in 1957 by a
House subcommittee on

 safety and compensation,

with union spokesmen again
facing the solid bpposition
both of the mining industry

and the‘ U.'S. Department I

of the’ Interior’. The mine
safety bill was not ‘reported

_out for a vote‘ in eitherthe‘

House or the Senate. .
 And‘ so it was for the re-
maining years -of the Eisen-

hower administration. The

PROGRESS OF THE MINE SAFETY CAMPAIGN was a constant topic on the agenda at Mine-Mill executive board
meetings over the years. Here the present board discusses the subject, with able assistance from Arthur Stuart H
(right), the union's research director. L. to R.: Maclovio Barraza, board member for District 2; Barney Rask, District

1; Asbury Howard, vice-president; A. C. Skinner, president; Irving Dichter, secreta
trict 4; Verne Curtis, District 3; Alfred Petit—Clair, District 5; and Stuart. » ‘

and other interested gov-
ernmergfr, agencies.

More’ hearings were held
about a month later, in
May, 1965, by a, select sub-
committee, chaired by Con-
gressman O’Hara of the
House Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. Under
discussion were both the
administration bill and the
stronger proposal backed
by Mine-Mill. "In the '89th

’ Congress, the original spon-

sors of the union’s bill were
joined by Congressmen Da-
vid King (D—Utah) , E. S.

(John*-‘...»_’) Walker (D- ‘

N.M.), and Edward J. Pat-
ten (D-N.J.).

President Skinner and In-
ternational Representative
Leo Terrill, who had been
assigned to Washington
early in the year for the

mine safety campaign, were ’

among the Mine-Mill
spokesmen at the hearings.

-O’Hara who called the

union’s testimony “excel-
lent.” said he was “particu-
larly interested in the por-
trayal of the efforts of your
organization to strengthen
the mine. safety operations
of the ‘states, and the nearly
total failure of those
efforts.” .
The bill reported out by
the subcommittee incorpo-
rated numerous recommen-
dations of the labor repre-
sentatives, although it did
not cover smelters and re-
fineries as provided inthe

.Mine-Mill sp on s ored bill.
Cleared for House consid-

eration by thefull Commit-
tee on Education and
Labor, the bill passed the

lower chamber , by voice .

vote in September, 1965.

United ‘Labor Committee
' To ensure favorable Cori-
gressional action, unions in-

’ terested in the bill early in
the year had formed for.

the first time a union mine
safety committee in Wash-.
ington to coordinate lobby-

ing efforts at the Capitol.
Terrill, who remained in"
Washington_during the
Congressional sessions last
year and this, played an
active role in establishing
the committee, which in-
cluded, in addition to Mine-
Mill, the United Steelwork-
ers, the ‘~ Teamsters, the
United Mine Workers, Oil-
Chemical, District 50, the
"Chemical ‘Workers, the In-
ternational Brotherhood of

‘ Electrical W o r k e r s, the

Operating Engineers,- and
the AFL-CIO legislative de-
partment. .

The group took responsi-

- bility for advising local’

unions throughout the
country when crucial votes
were imminent, so that di-
rect communication from
the locals could be made
with their Congressional
representatives. Meanwhile,
Mine-Mill continued to cir-
culate its pamphlet “A
Mine Safety Bill Now,” en-
couraging several publica-
tions ’ to take an editorial
stand -in support of the pro-
posed legislation.

. Senate Passage
House action came too

late for Senate considera- .

tion in 1965, but this March

"a subcommittee of the Sen-

ate Committee on Labor
and Public Welfare held
hearings on the House-
passed measure. President
Skinner again_'testified for

Mine-Mill at the sessions, ‘

chaired by Sen.» Gaylord

Nelson” (D-Wise.) L 'Sen".Met; '

calf, although not a mem-
ber of the subcommittee,

sat in and was of invaluable

help, because of his long ex-

perience with the subject,.

in questioning witnesses.
Several strengthening
amendments to the House-
passed bill were included in
the version of the bill
passed by the Senate by a

- vote of 57 to 18 on June 23.
The floor manager for the _

bill was Sen. Wayne Morse
(D-Ore.) , ably assisted by
Metcalf.

On August 31, both House
and Senate approved a ver-
sion of the bill hammered
out by conferees, who met
earlier in the month to iron
out the differences between
the Senate and House-
passediversions.-The Metal
and Nonmetallic Mines
Safety Act became ‘law
when President J 0 h n s on
signed the measure on
Sept. 16.

The American Mining

Congress met in Salt Lake
City last month, as the.
mine safety bill awaited the _

President’s signature. Sen.

Paul Fannin (R-Ariz.) , who.

had attempted’ unsuccess-
fully last spring to secure
adoption of crippling
amendments and ultimately
had voted against the mine
safety bill, - addressed the

. AMC, entitling his speech,

“The Metal and Nonmetal-
lic Mines Safety Act of 1966
—Is a Federal Takeover
Necessary?” Fannin echoed
the plea of the AMC lobby-
ists who had swarmed

through the halls of Con-,

gress this session imploring
Senators and Congressmen
to “let the states do it.” _‘

. Bitter Attack
“Federal encroachment,”
cried Fannin to the Ameri-
can Mining Congress meet-
ing, denouncing the safety
bill, too, as “legislation by

, slogan” and “one more nail

in the ‘coffin’ of responsible
state government.” His

punch lines are worth quot- .

ing: . . . .
“As representatives of

-one of our most ‘vital _‘

basic industries, you must
recognize the “plain fact

that we are heading away  -

from constitutional gov-
ernment in the United

States. You cannot ex- _

pect that directionjto

Chicago Workers Win New
Contract with National Lead

CHICAGO, Ill.—Major health and welfare plan improvements plus 20 cents in across-the-board in-

’ creases were among the major gains scored in a three-year agreement signed last month between the

Magnus Metal Unit of Mine-Mill Local No. 758 and the National Lead Company. Retroactive to July 1,
the new contract also affords supplemental unemployment and pension benefits, improved vacations,

and an additional holiday.

Wages are increased this year by five cents an hour, plus a one-cent adjustment for three job
classifications, with further hikes of seven and eight cents an hour scheduled in the second and third

years respectively.’ A night
shift differential of 10 percent,
based on rates in effect on
June 30, this year, will be paid
for all shifts starting at 3:30
p.m. or later.

Health and Welfare

The Blue Cross-Blue Shield

. hospitalization coverage has
been increased from 120 to 365
days, with medical and surgical
schedules raised from $300 to
$650. Also, employees now will
be covered under a $5,000 major
medical plan which pays 80 per-
cent of medical expenses not
covered under the basic plan.
This plan is non-contributory
after an employee has six
months’ service.

Benefits for a non-compensa-
ble illness or injury have been
upped to $65 per week for 52
weeks, with increases to $70 in
the second year and $75 in the
third year. Benefits are payable

_ on the first day of an accident
and on the fourth day of an ill-
ness, with the company paying
the entire cost of the plan. ' '

Should: a lost time industrial
injury be incurred, the em-
ployee;would receive, in addi-
tion to workInen’s compensa-
tion, weekly payments from the
company in the same amountas
those paid for a non-comp-ensa-
ble mishap. These payments
would continue for the period of
time lost from work.

“In the event of a lay—off, sup-

‘rplemental unemployment bene-
fits will be paid, based on an
employee’s' length of service.
Workers with two to 10 years
of service would receive $20
-weekly; with 10 to 15_ years, $25
per week; and with 15 or more
years of service, $30. These
benefits to continue as long as
the laid-off employee is receiv-
ing state unemployment com-
pensation checks.

Supplemental benefits also are

force.‘ . These

made available to a retiring em-
ployee whose pension fails to
meet a certain minimum stand-
ard.

Vacations have been improved
to provide a fifth week after 25

. years of service, and an addi-

tional holiday (the Friday after
Thanksgiving) was won—both to
go into effect in 1967. The extra
week of vacation is an impor-

. ber;

tant gain because at least half
of the current employees will be
_eligible for this during the life
of the agreement.

Negotiating for the union were
Raymond Dennis, Mine-Mill Dis-
trict 4 executive board, mem-
Arthur Lee, local shop
chairman; and Robert Jasper,
Carl Graham, and Jesus San-
chez, committeemen.

llinimum Wage Gains Won

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Presi-
dent Johnson on Sept. 23 signed
into law new minimum wage
standards which labor leaders

predicted will prove to be the
country’s most potent weapon
in the war against poverty.

The conference committee re-
port on the measure, which
combined the strongest features
of the separate House and Sen-
ate versions, was cleared by
the House on Sept. 7 by a 260
to 89 vote. The Senategave its

approval a week later. on a 55 _

to 38 roll-call.

While labor said that cover-
age of the law is still not broad
enough and that the minimum,
partciularly for farm workers,
still should be increased,» the

.bill provides the biggest pack-

age of improvements in the
law’s 28-year history. For the
29.5 million persons already
covered by the Fair Labor
Standards Act, it will raise the
minimum wage from the pres-
ent $1.25 an hourto $1.40 on
Feb. 1, 1967 and to $1.60 a year
later.

Coverage will be extended to

an additional 8.1 million work-

ers, including about one-fifth of
the nation’s agricultural labor
newly

New Three-Year Contract

-Signed with Hardy Salt

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—A new three-year agreement between
Mine-Mill Local 876 and the Hardy Salt Company was reached on
Sept. 15, providing wage gains ranging from 24 to 32 cents an hour
and other important contract improvements.

Retroactive to Sept. 1, wages at the company’s Lakepoint plant ‘

’ were increased from 8 to 16 cents an hour depe-nding on job classi-
fication. Additional across-the-board pay hikes of 7 and 9 cents

_ will take effect on Sept. 1, 1967 and 1968 ‘respectively.

Major gains were achieved in the health and welfare plan,

year‘ and throughthe addition

- of the Kennecott major medical

program. The employee pre-

 mium for dependent coverage
’ has been reduced to $6.75 per

‘month this year, with a further
reduction to $3.00 scheduled in
1967, and agreement for a non-

-contributory plan in 1968. D.e-

pendents will be covered from
the time of birth.
' Other Gains

Injured employees will re-
ceive accident benefits for up to
26 weeks at the rate of $54 for
persons earning $96 to $108
weekly and of $60 per ‘week for

  persons with earnings of $108. or

more.
Employees serving on jury

V duty will now receive a differen-

tial between their regular pay

- '*5'§vith the elimination of contributions for employee coverage this

sentative L. L. Nielsen and lo-
cal union committee members
Paul Newman, Kenneth Gar-
rard, and Harry Naylor.

The company,_ formerly the.

Leslie Salt Company, has been
renamed since the -previous
contract agreement was signed
in 1963. About 30 workers are
employed at the property

covered

workers will begin with a $1-a.n-
hour minimum on Feb. 1, 1967.
On that date in each subsequent
year, their minimum will in-
crease by 15 cents an~hour-—un-
til farm workers reach $1.30
and until non-farm workers
catch up to the $1.60 figure.

Newly Covered Workers

In addition to agricultural
workers, newly covered work-
ers include those in retail trade,
restaurants, hotels and motels,
hospitals and nursing homes,
laundries and dry cleaning

establishments, construction,
federal employment, transporta-
tion and taxi service, and non-
teaching public school employ-
ment.

Except for those in seasonal
industries, newly covered work-
ers, too, will gradually be
brought unde-r the 40-hour ceil-
ing on straight-time work.

Sen. Ralph Yarborough (D-
Texas) and Rep. John H. Dent
(D-Pa.) served as floor man-
agers for thebill in their respec-
tive chambers. Crippling
amendments to exempt many
smaller businesses and to re-
duce the agricultural workers’
minimum were defeated.

  King Race Crucial One
 For Utah M-M Locals

= With no gubernatorial or senatorial contest on tap
this year, the labor movement in Utah, including Mine-
_lMill’s locals in the state, is concentrating its political
efforts on behalf of U. S. Rep. David S. King (D), who
faces a close race in his bid for re-election. In the state’s
other Congressional district, where Mine-Mill member-
ship is negligible, Laurence J. Burton (R) is strongly

favored to win another term.

 King, whose overall liberal-record has earned him

have been fully evaluated.

Representatives f r_o in t h e
United Steelworkers, the United
Mine Workers of America, and
other labor unions attended the
ceremony in the Cabinet Room,
in addition to Skinner, who de-
clared that “ “Federal action
comes as a result of the con-
tinued failure by the states to
meet their responsibilities in
protecting the health and the
very lives of the workers inthe
industry.” Also present were
several" members of Congress
who had worked for the bill’s
passage.

Lengthy Struggle

The Mine-Mill president noted
that his union had initiated the

fight for federal legislation in

this area back in the early
1950's, when thelate Sen. James
Murray (D-Mont.) introduced a
bill on the subject. Mine safety
hearings resulted finally, in
1961, in a bill authorizing the
Secretary of the Interior to sur-
vey the health and safety con-
ditions in the industry‘ and to
make recommendations on his
findings. ' f

In 1965, the Johnson adminis-
tration itself introduced a mine
safety bill, and, during the pres-

ent’ session of Congress, a unified
.-labor lobby was formed in Wash-

ington to push for its enactment.
Participating unions, in addi-
tion to Mine-Mill, the Steelwork-
ers, ' and the United Mine Work-

-ers, included the Teamsters,

Oil-Chemical, the International

Chemical Workers, the Operat-V

ing Engineers, District? 50, and
the. International Brotherhood of

‘Electrical Workers. -The na-

THE MINE-MILL UNION

October. 1966

ACLU Files Brief Asking
Reversal of Hoffa Conviction

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The American Civil Liberties Union has urged the U. S.
Supreme Court to set aside the jury tampering convictions of James R. Hoffa, presi-
dent of the Teamsters Union, and Z. T. Osborn, Jr., one of his lawyers, on the ground
that techniques used by government informers to obtain evidence against the two men
violated their constitutional guarantee to the right of privacy.

Noting that the Supreme Court “has long recognized and protected the claims of
privacy,” the civil liberties group said that “there seems to have been little judicial
consideration . . . of how privacy can be impaired by the use of spies and the encour-
agement of crime.” The organization, in a friend-of-the-court brief submitted last

month on behalf of Hoffa, urged
the high court to hand down the
first decision that these tech-

_ ,. niques are unconstitutional.

("V

, tin’s

Recently Re-elected

Hoffa, recently re-elected as
president of the nation’s largest
labor union, was convicted in
M a r ch, 1964 in Chattanooga,
Tenn. of attempting to bribe the
jury in his trial on conspiracy
charges in Nashville, Tenn. in
1962. The 1962 trial, which in-
volved the charge that Hoffa had
accepted a pay-off of $1 million
from a trucking concern to en-
sure labor peace, resulted in a
hopelessly deadlocked jury—re-
portedly splitting 7 to 5 for ac-
quittal,

Convicted in 1964, however,
Hoffa was sentenced to an eight-
year prison term and fined $10,-
000. It is this case that the Su-
preme Court last year agreed to
review.

In its brief to the high court,
the ACLU contended that Ed-
ward Grady Partin, a Louisiana
Teamsters local official and the
star witness for the prosecution,
had been asked by the govern-
ment'to serve as an informer
during the earlier 1962 trial.
Partin’s search for evidence
against Hoffa in the Teamsters
leader’s private hotel quarters
was a forced entry without Hof-
fa’s consent, asserted the civil
liberties group, because of Par-
“concealment of his role
as a government spy and his

passing himselfoff as a loyal

friend.”

“To make Hoffa assume the
risk that so «abhorrent a search
would be made by the govern-
ment of a free country,” the brief
added, “would sacrifice the
Fourth Amendment (to the Con-
stitution),” which prohibits un-

' reasonable searches.

.The brief noted, too, that Par-
tin, while in Nashville, met with
various la w y e r s representing
Hoffa and was present while

. they discussed various aspects

. August.

of the_case. The use of his testi-
mony in the Chattanooga trial,
said the ACLU, also violated

Hoffa’s Sixth Amendment right
to counsel.

Payments of $1.200

Although Partin himself was
in trouble with the law on sev-
eral charges, including one of
kidnapping, prosecution of the
charges has not been pursued.
Further subgtantiating his role
as informer,” the ACLU brief
points to payments totaling $1,-
200 made to Partin’s wife under
the authorization of a Depart-

‘ment of Justice investigator.

A second ACLU brief in the
Osborn case pointed out that
Robert D. Vick, a Nashville po-
lice officer and special employ-
ee of the FBI, who suspected Os-
born of jury tampering, deceived
the lawyer into thinking that he
“would participate in such tam-
pering and encouraged Osborn
into words and activities which

. showed an attempt by Os-
born to corrupt justice.” Assert-
ing that “the record does not
show . . . that Vick’s suspicions
were based on any solid fact,”
the brief stressed lack of proba-
ble cause in Vick’s baiting of
Haffa’s attorney.

“Few things cause greater re-
sentment and, ultimately, con-
tempt for the law,” the brief
continued, “than the use of an
entrapper who may himself be a
‘drug addict. pickpocket, pimp
or petty criminal.’ ”

Defense Asserifons

Hoffa, for several years now,
has charged that he has been
the target of a vendet':a by for-
mer Attorney General Robert
Kennedy and the Justice Depart-
ment. The defense during the
Chattanooga trial attempted to
show that the Teamsters leader
and his lawyers were under con-
stant FBI surveillance and that
the prosecution was engaged in
many other irregularities,

Over and above the specific
legal questions raised by the
trial, maintains Fred J. Cook in
a lengthy article on the proceed-
ing in the April 27, 1964 edition
of The Nation, the real issue of
the trial is this: “Was justice

placed in hazard by a form of
jungle warfare?”

“Regardless of the outcome of
Hoffa’s individual case on ap-
peal,” wrote the prize-winning
journalist, “Congress should ex-
amine the record to determine
whether federal law enforce-
ment is becoming a law unto it-
self.”

Also on appeal is Hoffa’s con-
viction on charges of pension
fund fraud, which carries a sen-
tence of five years in prison and
a $10,000 fine.

Osmond K. Fraenkel, ACLU
general counsel, and Melvin L.
Wulf, the group's legal director,
prepared the friend-of-the-court
brief in the Hoffa case, while co-
operating attorneys H e r m a n
Schwartz and Anthony G. Am-

sterdam and Wulf prepared the‘

Osborn brief. The civil liberties
organization filed two briefs in
the Mine-Mill “conspiracy” case,
which the Supreme Court over-
turned in June—-one asking-the
high court to review the case,
the other urging a reversal of
the convictions.

Mine-Mill, in convention reso-
lutions, has expressed support
for Hoffa and confidence in his
ultimate vindication.

I The Labor Scene  

Strike Continues at St. John's

The largest Catholic university in the United States, St. John's
in New York, is still being struck by members of the United Fed-
eration of College Teachers, led by the Rev. Peter O’Reially, one
of 23 faculty members dismissed without hearing by university
officials. The strike, going into its tenth month, began January 4
over demands for greater academic freedom, a voice in policy
making, increased salaries, and job protection. The New York
Times reports that, “Inasmuch as most of the demands were met
during the year . . . the union is now seeking an offer of reinstate‘-
ment for the former faculty members, clearing them of charges of
professional misconduct.” .

A study of textbooks used in Los Angeles high schools, says a

New President for URW

United Rubber Workers President George Burdon, head of the
union for the past six years, withdrew his candidacy for re-election
in the face of certain defeat. He is succeeded by Peter Bommarito,
vice-president during Burdon’s three terms, who was elected by
acclamation at the union's convention last month. The industry
anticipates hard bargaining in the next round of negotiations, in
the wake of charges that Burdon had failed to play a sufficiently
active leadership role in bargaining.

New Approach in England

A British fiber spinning plant has put into effect a new
approach to the eight-hour work day. The employer allows unlim-
ited tea ‘breaks, lunch periods, relief periods. The workers can
come and go as they please. In return, the company asks‘ for a
full eight hours’ work for eight hours’ pay, maximum efficiency,
and quality production. The plant manager says that in the three
weeks since the new program has been in effect it has been very
successful. The employees are reported to be enthusiastic.

More on Hours of Work

The Wall Street Journal reports that a plastics plant in Read-
ing, Pa., learning that some of its employeeswere moonlighting,
offered the men evening work at overtime rates. The company
president says it’s working out very well.

And, Pratt & Whitney division of United Aircraft has added a
four-hour shift, from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m., for skilled workers who
want extra work, but who don’t want to put in a full shift. The
company reports the results are encouraging.

New Development in Fringes
A new development in negotiated fringe benefits is in the wind:

group coverage in the field of personal property and casualty '

(including automobile) insurance. Where it now exists, it is mainly
in the form of a payroll deduction plan, with employees paying all
or part of the cost. The New York Times reports that the United
Auto Workers may make this a collective bargaining demand when
its major contracts come up for negotiation next year.

Labor reaction is not united, however. Although" some em-'

ployees like the idea because of a possible saving, others have
said they prefer to continue with the services of an insurance
broker.

Another complication is the fact that most insurance companies
do_ business under the terms of widely varying state laws. This
might make uniformity of coverage difficult. The AFL-CIO las
year pushed for legislation to deal with this problem. ’

First IUE Convention Under Jennings .'

The_ International Union of Electrical Workers held its first
convention under the gavel of Paul Jennings who defeated long-
time president James Carey two years ago after an “official” elec-
tron count was dramatically reversed. Observers say the conven-
tion was harmonious, with delegates concentrating much of their
attention on current negotiations with General Electric and West-
inghouse.

A 50-cent per member per week assessment was approved in
the event of a strike against either of the big electrical companies.
Other major convention items included a demand for a $5.00 per
month pension benefit, development of a broad civil rights pro-
gram, and constitutional changes to prevent a repetition of the
1964 election fraud.

ABA Opposes Compulsory Arbitration

The American Bar Association, meeting in Montreal recently,
voted to reject compulsory arbitration as a means of solving labor
disputes. The Assoc1at1on’s House of Delegates, its governing body,

acted after its labor law section, composed of lawyers from both _
labor and management, overwhelmingly voted down a resolution--‘
calling for compulsory arbitration of disputes in railroad, airline-

and maritime transport. ' I
Howard Schulman, general counsel for the Seafarers’ Interna-

tional Union, said the action represents the opinion of some of the

most highly trained labor law experts in the United States, and

added, “It will give Congress the basis and knowledge to deny‘

6 . . Productsfroni Uranium Mill Tailings Hazardous

Uranium mill tailings have been iifed for making cinder blocks and for roadbeds and as filler
under new buildings in the Grand Junction, Colorado area, according to the U.S. _ Public Health
Service. Cinder blocks made from tailings have been used in the construction of a high school and

‘ sporting goods store there.

Federal experts say decaying radium in these materials gives off radon gas which can pro-

duce lung cancer if breathed in sufficient quantities.

“Living in a building made of these cinder

blocks would be like living in a poorly ventilated uranium mine,” according to one Public Health

Service spokesman.

The Colorado Health Department now has clamped down on the use of uranium mill tailings for

cinder "blocks and other materials.

For some time the U. S. Pub-

’ lic Health Service and the Water
Pollution Control Administration
have had a dispute with the,
U.. S. Atomic Energy Commis-
sion over the ' long-run hazards
of uranium tailings piles. The

_ Water Pollution Control Com-
mission testified recently to the

_ threat of leakage of radioactive
materials from tailings piles in-
to streams and water supplies.
The Atomic Energy Commission

‘contends ‘ there is no danger, _

immediate or long-range.
, . The Public Health Service is
" trying, thus ‘far without success,_
"'4-Jo convince the.Atomic Energy
'_ Commission that measures must
be taken to eliminate these haz-
ards in the pollution and radon
gas fields. The Atomic Energy
Commission’ is the only federal
agency with legal power to con-
' trol'-the tailings piles.
