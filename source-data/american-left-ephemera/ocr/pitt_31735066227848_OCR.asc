with their sisters from “enemy” countries, as American men and women sat with Mme.
Pak Den Ai of Korea at the second meeting of the World Peace Council recently:
planning for negotiation, disarmament, and how to make governments answerable to
the needs of their peoples.

The Women’s Peace Party and many of its branches met continually throughout
the world wars. In 1918 a second International Women’s Congress met in the Hague.
This organization, with branches in 34« countries, is today known as the Women’s,
International League for Peace and Freedom. Its American section maintains a full-
time lobbyist in Washington and has consultant status to the United Nations. Its
Honorary President and Nobel Prize winner, Emily Greene Balch, has an unbroken
record from that day to this of fearlessopposition to the efforts to corrupt science -and
scientists for the uses of war.

Believedvby a large number of Americans to be “a war to end wari’ World War I
was followed by complete disillusionment. Personal loss embittered thousands of
Americans. Innocent millions in Europe suffered starvation ‘and disease. The Allies
changed boundary lines and governments with little concern for the populations
involved. The world was not made safe for democracy. War debts were repudiated by
European governments struggling to rebuild and reorganize. Unbombed, undevastated,
we heaped up our war proﬁts. Germany and the Allies sold war material to one another

throughout the war.

The conscience of America was roused. The greatest war in our history seemed
to be yielding to the greatest peace movement in our history. The Government had to
respond. The Washington Disarmament Conference of 1921 was called largely because
of organized pressure from peace forces in women’s organizations. The Women’s~
World Court Committee, representing seventeen women’s organizations, worked con-
stantly at the Capitol for the passage of the World Court Resolution, and is given
credit for its passage. ' —

The American Federationiof Teachers’ platform in 1927 stated, “The teachers of
the world should tell the truth about war, its cold-blooded butchery, its elimination of
the biologically ﬁt, its economic chaos, its debts, starvation, misery, disease . . . and
glorify the heroes of peace as symbolized by the physician . . . or by the idealist who
holds fast to minority views which make man’s progress possible?’ The World Federa-
tion of Teachers, emphasizing that these views are now those of the majority of people ‘
in all countries, issues similar statements from peace Congresses in Mexico, Paris, and
Warsaw today. ’

“During the ’twenties everybody strove for a policy of peace with disarmament?
Cordell Hull recorded in his Memoirs.

.“The Kellogg-Briand Pact (outlawing war) was signed by ambassadors because it
was demanded by the public opinion of the world:’ said Robert Morss Lovett in his
book All Our Years; “No statesman, no government dared to ‘ﬂout’ public opinion by
refusing to sign3’.Mr. Lovett is today in the forefront of the national campaign to ban
the A-bomb and restore big power agreement in the United Nations. ' A

According to the League of Nations in 1921 “. . .’the public mind is strongly
prejudiced against the uncontrolled private manufacture of munitions and implements

of war. . . . It is common belief that wars are promoted by the competitive zeal of
armament ﬁrms, and would be rendered less frequent were the proﬁt making impulse
brought under control or eliminated altogether?’ Temporary Mixed Commission on
Armaments, Report A81, 1921.

During these years of peace activity, American business and government had been
quietly furthering the new imperialism.

General Smedley D. Butler wrote in War Is A Racket: “I spent 33 years and 4

. months in active service as a member of our country’s most agile military force — the
‘ Marine Corps. And during that period I spent most of my time being a high-class_

muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street, and for the bankers. In short, I was a
racketeer, a gangster for capitalism . . .

“Thus I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil
interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City
Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central
American republics for the beneﬁt of Wall Street. . . . I helped purify Nicaragua for
the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-12. I brought light to the
Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China in 1927 I helped
to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested. During those years I had, as
the boys in the back room would say, ‘a swell racket.’ I was rewarded with honors,
medals, promotion . . .”

Senator Borah of Idaho adds this statement concerning Nicaragua, “We went to
Nicaragua in 1910. In my judgment we never had suﬁicient reason forgoing there.
Nevertheless we sent our marines there, landed them, took possession of the country,
marched to the capital, killed some 200 Nicaraguans, and placed in control, as nominal
President of Nicaragua, a clerk or employee of a corporation in Pittsburg 3’

In Haiti in 1914 the United States demanded the right to collect customs revenues.
The Haitian Government refused. American marines landed shortly after and made
themselves at home for the nextieighteen years, during which time American business
interests bought up land, sugar mills, public utilities, and even the Bank of Haiti.

In the early ’twenties, when Germany was faced with bread riots and a rising
Socialism, Great Britain and the United States lent her eight hundred million marks.
This loan was used largely to ﬁnance preparations for another war, not for food. Yet
further loans, unregulated, were extended. “American private investors subscribed in

the next six years to over one billion dollars in bonds of the German government, states .

and corporations; American banks advanced German borrowers another billion dollars
in short termcreditsf’ (Cordell Hull, Memoirs.) German militarist and fascist groups
were given millions of dollars by French, British and American business men who

relied on them to ,protect foreign investments in Germany. Ambassador William .E. .

Dodd notedthis in his diary, and pointed out how certain Americans_ were sowing the
seeds for another world war. I

  

 

_ In 1929’ a Senate investigation disclosed that William Shearer had been subsidized_
by three American shipbuilding ﬁrms to wreck the Geneva Disarmament Conference
of the League of Nations two yearsaearlier. In 1934 the Senate Munitions Investigation
Committee revealed that, through propaganda, bribes, and lobbying, the Munitions
Interests had caused ever-mounting “defense” expenditures. Pressure of the peace
movement led to these disclosures.

V
Most Americans, during the depression days of the early ’thirties, were seeking
new solutionsto the ‘problems created by closed factories and banks and mass unem-
ployment at home, but peace efforts did not falter.

The mass student peace movement of the mid-thirties was -a striking development. -

The students, led by such organizations as the Student Christian Movement and the

American StudentUnion, denounced the increasing militarization of the campuses and .
' declared they would never ﬁght in an aggressive war. Mass student peace strikes were

held every Aprilthrough these years; in 1935, 175,000 students left their classes to
demonstrate for peace; the -next year the number of student peace strikers jumped to
half a million. '

A Abroad, the .1930’s broughtdisaster to the people '— the Japanese invasion of
China, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and a fascist Germany girded for war. .

American peace forces, throughout the ’twenties and ’thirties had advocated
measures which would have made the victories‘ of fascism impossible. They supported
Maxim Litvinov of the Soviet Union when he advocated total disarmament in the
League of Nations in 1932. The Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom
advocated international investigation of the world munitions industry, and with a
petition containing 151/2 million signatures, called for an end to the economic anarchy
that breeds war..

Fascistiidoctrinesw of ? racial supremacy, anti-Semitism, and world conquest ran
counter to the vital convictions of freedom-loving Amerians. Peace groups, religious

andtlabor organizations had ties with those who suffered from fascist persecution in Z

Europe and Asia. Great writers, artists, and scientists, determined to use their skills for
peace and freedom, came here for political asylum, and are among the most resolute
spokesmen for United ‘Nations’ cooperation today. Ministers and labor organizers,
dockers and housewives, farmers and industrial workers joined in new forms of
opposition to war and fascism. There were boycotts of fascist-made goods, refusals
to load or unload war materials, peace vigils, petitions for collective security, and:
every form of aid to Jews and other victims of fascism.

_ H I Americans_pﬂo"f'Athe' most diverse views saw war and fascism as ‘twin evils. When the
 and Italian“fascist war _r_égimes intervened‘ in the'Span_ish‘ Civil War and tested
their new" weapons‘ of mass destruction against’ the Spanish government, popular

tp] General Francisco Franco. Our government, together with Great Britain and France,
s ut oﬁ supplies to the embattled people of Spain and proclaimed a policy, of, neutrality.
By standing aside, these governments actually aided the aggressors who were armed
by Hitler and M11SSOl1nl. A decisive defeat of the fascist forces in Spain, it was later

realized, would have made the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis revise its plans for world

conquest.

By the end of 194.1 the three axis powers had attacked China, Great Britain,
France, the United States and the Soviet Union. World War II was on. Many smaller;
powers were over-run. The peoples of the American continents were almost the_ only
ones who were not bombed and invaded. They fought to keep-fascism from these
shores. - v ‘ ' e . .. A '

The American peace movement had educated wide sections lofour people as to-the
need for collective security and world organization-, eventuating; in.-3 world.-wide "dis;
armament. These goals were advanced by President Roosevelt at every war-time
conference with Britain and the Soviet Union.  . . .-

The Atlantic Charter and, later, the United Nations Charter were supported as
guarantees for lasting peace by Americans of all. parties and beliefs. Paciﬁsts‘ and
conscientious objectors showed deep opposition to fascist doctrines and struggled for
a chance to do meaningful service in the cause of democracy at home, while our ﬁght-
ing men defeated fascism abroad. Freedom of speech and religion, freedom from fear

-and want, were goals worth living for and worth dying for.

In 1945 the Allies won the war against fascism. The United Nations’ became 
reality——but peace is still to be won. - -

The ‘American peace movement is moving forward, conﬁdent of the principles worth
living and dying for and, for theﬁrst time in history, given the conditions which can
make peace triumph. Peace with plenty is now within the world’s ‘grasp. Modern

science has given many command of productive techniques by which he can supply his

materials and lives, and to trade freely throughout the world. The ‘reality and power

It is people, not governments, who ﬁght modern war. If no government feels that
it can count on the support of its people in launching a world war, there will be no
world war. Since 1945, the work of the International Red Cross, of the World Council
of Churches and of the World Peace Appeal — all calling for the control and outlawing
of the atom bomb — has been a major factor in keeping the A-bomb from being used

‘and in causing the United Nations to set up a Disarmament Commission.

We are now engaged in a war in Korea, almost six thousand miles from our
shores. We have been ﬁghting longer in this war than in World War I, and it has cost
us more casualties. It threatens to rob us -of our free speech. It has resulted in
dangerous deﬁcit ﬁnancing. Inﬂation is lowering the _living standards of our people,
has undermined thousands of small businesses, and threatens to destroy our economy.
Yet this war is a comparatively. minor conﬂict, “a police actioni’ waged in a remote
land whose people are little known to us. It developed from the impossible political and
economic situation, caused by our cold war and a divided Korea.

After one-and-a-half years of “saving” the Koreans we have brought them ruin.
Our Government’s cold war and hot war policies have netted us, as a reward for our
efforts, the contempt of the colored peoples of Asia and Africa. These peoples are
determined to free themselves from foreign domination and a feudal system which has
condemned them to annual incomes of less than a hundred dollars a year per capita.

“The day of the white man’s rule in Asia is gone. America with all its wealth
and all its guns cannot support the feudal system in Asia and cannot stoprevolutioni’
(Supreme Court Justice William 0. Douglas, press conference in Los Angeles, Feb. 27,
1952.)‘ Guns may bring temporary success but can never win against millions of people
in revolt against oppression. A better life will come only when people work together
on the problems of food, health, education, and economic security. The United Nations
was not set up to freeze conditions of oppression.

The defects of our cold war foreign policy were (high-lighted by our former
Ambassador to Great Britain, Joseph P Kennedy (address before the Economic Club
of Chicago, December 1'], 1951): “The Korean "war becomes more ghastly, more
utterly futile, as each day follows the last. Our international commitments, which had

been extended (by 1946) to the Mediterranean and the North Cape, now reach _

thousands of miles westward to New Zealand ‘and . . . Tasmania. In lndo-China,
American arms, American military aid, and American dollars are going to support
France’s desperate effort to keep her old colonial empire. . . .' The Arab world, whose

friendship has been ours, has turned against us. In Asia, only those states where we or
western ‘Europe have some semblance of control, support us. Burma, Malaya, Iran,
Egypt, all are seething with revolt . . . perhapsworse than all these is a fact on which
all observers agree, the growing anti-Americanism of Western Europe. It manifests
itself now openly at the highest levels of political expression. The sharp inﬂationary
trend and the consequent distress is laid at our door. Man after man, in factories and
in ﬁelds, charges us not only with his misfortune, but with "the design of pushing all
Europe into a war not of her own making . . . The picture is a tragic one, so tragic

that it behooves us to ask wh 3’ Mr. Kenned re'ects the o inion that -it is due to

on the theory» that our dollars can buy things that are not purchasable: will to resist‘,
will to rearm, will to ﬁght in another man’s cause?’ ‘

“. . . in the Atlantic we have formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In
the Middle East we have proposed the imposition of a Middle East Command on the

nations of that explosive area. Perhaps our next effort ‘will be to ally ourselves to the
‘ Eskimos of the North Pole and the penguins of the Antarctic. . . . No wonder Europe

reacts toward us with dull fatalism which sees defeat wherever she turns. . . . Our
policy for the last four years has achieved for the rest of the world neither its welfare
nor its security. Instead it has endangered bothj’ Mr. Kennedy concluded.

“The American assumption that war is inevitable is scaring the Europeans to death
. . . We assume that every one would prefer war to communism. I think this is a false
assumption. The European hope is to become a neutral force. We cannot by any

. abracadabra call war ‘peace’.” (Dorothy Thompson, speech in San Francisco, Novem-
_ber, 1951.‘) ' '

There is a growing realization abroad that rearrning according to United States’
plans will mean bankruptcy. The fall of F rance’s llth cabinet since 1946, the severe

questioning by Britons of Churchill’s war program, the breaking off of military alliance ‘

talks by the Mexican government, Indonesia’s refusal to accept United States’ military
aid, are a few recent signs of growing resistance to war. ‘ "

Popular disapproval has delayed the N.A.T.O. Army plans. General Eisenhower

still does not have as many French soldiers, in his army as there were French citizens’

demonstrating against him in Paris on January 9, 1951. Powerful peace groups in
France and England have been calling for an end to the British war in Malaya and the
French war in Indo-China as one way to lessen the tax and budgetary crises in their
countries. ‘ '

However they may diﬂer in race, religion, nationality or politics, hundreds of
millions of men and women in all countries are uniting on one paramount question;
“What can we do to prevent a third World War?”

In our own country 53 national peace organizations are working to ﬁnd an
answer to this question, as well_as more than 3,000 local peace committees scattered

-throughout our states. One outstanding organization is the Religious Society of

Friends, which has been active since colonial days. Another important peace group is,
the National Council Against Conscription, which has been pamphleteering and lobby»

_ ing against the building up of military forces and Universal Military Training.

Two‘ important but more recent ‘organizations are the Committee for Peaceful
Alternatives and theAmerican Peace Crusade.The former is sponsored by 250 religious

leaders and scholars. It held a national conference in Chicago, May 1950, with [703 ’

delegates, to discuss peaceful alternatives to the, cold war. Foreign policy, economy,

trade and civil liberties were examined. Dr. John B. Thompson, Dean of Rockefeller‘ I

Memorial Chapel, :Universitv of Chicago, was" chairman."The ‘American ‘Peace Crusade
was launched in February 1951 by eight distinguished Americans’ and includes among
it‘s~'sponso_r's’ suchjleaders 'as*Fred  Stover, ‘President Iowa Farmers’ .Union, Frof.

Louise Pettibone Smith of Wellesley College, and Maurice Travis, President of the
Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers’ Union. Twenty-eight hundred delegates from 37
states met in Washington. A National Peace Congress was convened in Chicago, June
1951, under the auspices of the American Peace Crusade. Five thousand delegates
attended.

The Progressive Party, which is now on the ballot in 38 states, will make peace
a major campaign issue.

American disapproval of the war in Korea is widespread and takes new forms.
Parents have refused war decorations for their children for the ﬁrst time in American
history. At Camp Stoneman one hundred soldiers each month have been trying to avoid
duty in Korea by committing petty crimes, according to the San Francisco Chronicle
(Jan. 19, 1952). There were no such reports during World War II. In San Bernardino,
California, ﬁfty cars‘ driven by wives of 40th Reserve Infantry Division soldiers
paraded through the business district to protest the 4«0th’s assignment to combat in
Korea. (Associated Press, Feb. 2, 1952.) Mrs. Doris Davis, wife of the American jet
ace shot down in Korea, received hundreds of letters from war widows when she told
the press, “If I could feel he lost his life for some good reason, I could feel better about
it, but this is a war without reason?’ (San Francisco News, Feb. 11, 1952.) A Gallup
Poll taken in December of 1951 reported that more than seventy percent of all
Americans favor a conference between Truman, Stalin, and Churchill to try to settle
the “cold war?’

It is common knowledge that there is less talk of war and more work for peace in
Europe, Africa, and Asia than in this hemisphere. In the Americas, news of local and
international peace rallies and congresses seldom breaks through the censorship which
has been put upon it. Widely publicized in France, China, Great Britain, the Soviet
Union, and among the delegates to the United Nations is the fact that, by January 1,
1952, 596,302,298 citizens in all countries had signed petitions calling for a Pact of
Peace among the Big Five powers of the United Nations. American peace forces were
delayed in this campaign by the attempt of the Justice Department to indict Dr. W. E.
B. DuBois and his Peace Information Center associates as “agents of a foreign power”
because of their work for peace. Nation-wide protests, supported by demonstrations
before many of the American embassies abroad, helped to free Dr. DuBois and to
restore the traditional rights of Americans to work for world friendship. The campaign
for peaceful negotiation and disarmament is gaining momentum.

The efforts of peace workers everywhere, plus _economic conditions, have pre-
vented governments from sending more than token forces to Korea. The Arab
governments were afraid to send troops to Korea because of popular resistance in their
countries, according to the New York Times. The promise of Dictator Peron of Argen-
tina to send military forces was countered by a demonstration in the city of Rosario
which forced him to keep his troops at home. The fact that the Korean war has been
contained in a small area for almost two years, with truce talks holding down the
ﬁghting for a good part of that time, demonstrates the determination of the peoples
to control their war machines and to prevent the war from spreading to other parts
of the world.

Two thousand delegates -from 81 lands went to Warsaw in the autumn of 1950 to V

attend the Second World Peace Congress. These scientists, trade unionists, artists,
government oﬂicials, churchmen, farmers, students, engineers, soldiers, and merchants,

I6‘

 

   

represented almost every shade of opinion. They worked long hours to ‘draw up
recommendations to_ the United Nations. In making decisions, they rejected the
practice of abiding by majority votes on single issues and developed instead the
method of debating until an area of agreement was reached. Only those proposals were
ﬁnally adopted to which delegates of all belief-patterns and all types of economic and
political systems could agree. They selected a Word Peace Council of 170 people,
eleven from the United States, with atomic scientist Frederick J oliot-Curie, Nobel
Prize winner, as President. Dr. Willard Uphaus of the Methodist Church was elected
among the many international vice-presidents of the Council and was later made one
of the co-directors of the American Peace Crusade. .

The World Peace Council met in Berlin in February 1951 and in Vienna in
November 1951. Represented at the Vienna meeting were the British Fellowship of
Reconciliation and the World Paciﬁst Movement, through its world organization. An
observer from the American Society of Friends (Quakers) was also present. They
were in accord that the central issue today is disarmament and a program of world
reconstruction, to be developed through the instrumentality of a United Nations in
which Great Britain, France, China, the United States and the Soviet Union had
agreed not to make war upon each other.

Will the Soviet Union honestly join in such an agreement? The British Quakers
report: “We would lay special emphasis on the importance of resisting moods of
scepticism where the peace declarations of the Soviet Union are concerned. There is
no question of the eagerness of the ordinary Russian for an assured international
peace, and in him the desire is perhaps the more conscious because peace is obviously
essential to the immense tasks of reconstruction and modernization which his country
is facing?’ And of the Soviet Covernment’s attitude towards peace, the Quakers aﬂirm:
“We can testify from our experience to the more conciliatory temper toward the
‘West’ which prevails in the Soviet Union today, and to the persistence with which the
necessity of peace and of peaceful understandings between the major powers is being
commended to thesSoviet people?’ (Report of the British Quaker Mission to Moscow,
Sept. 7, 1951.)

Unlike Nazi.Germany, economic and social advances and increased power poten-
tial in the Soviet Union depend on peace. “Military expenses in 1951 accounted for
just 21% of the budget of the Soviet Union, compared with 27% in 1937, and 32% in
19403’ (From a talk by Hans Blumenfeld, of the Philadelphia Planning Commission
January 14«, 1952.) “. . . the number one topic of conversation and interest in Moscow
is the Government’s vast new hydroelectric program . . .” N. 1’. Times, Oct. 12, 1950.

Those who fear that nations with Communist governments will attack us might
consider whether it is in the interest of these nations to do so. Governments, of what-
ever form, are responsible for the welfare of their own people, and such enlightened
self-interestis a ﬁrm and enduring basis for world peace. Is it to the interest of
Communist-led governments to attack the rest of the world? Hardly. These govern-
ments need to fulﬁll their promises to their people. They have to‘ prove that Commun-
ism will raise the-standard of living and give security and a healthy and creative life.

while pursulngtheir own way of hfe ?- Is our self-interest enlightened at this point? It
would seem not, from the following statements: , -

In April, 1951, Charles E. Wilson, then Director of Defense Mobilization, said in
Washington that if Stalin “could see the new bombs, which are far more devastating
than anything we knew in the last war, he’d realizerthat these new bombs will make
ﬁne ‘calling cards’ from the United States for Russia?’

“Now that we have a good start with the hydrogen bomb, we should lay ‘down the
law, not as diplomats but as soldiers. We have got to act while we have the advantage?’

J (General Howley, U.S. Commander-in-Chief, Berlin, February 6, 1950.)

How is America preparing “to lay down the law notas diplomats but as soldiers”?
In the Congressional Record of February 7, 1952, Congressman Buffett (Nebraska
Republican) records that he has received from the Department of Defense these facts:

41 governments have troops training in the United States, largely paid for by our '

taxpayers; we are actively training troops of 19" nations on foreign soil. Mr. Buflett
warns: “Our present military global operations will, if continued only a short time,
make our economic ruin certain . . .'our military expansion, with its goal of dominating
the globe outside Russia’s borders, will almost certainly end either in economic collapse
and dictatorship in America, or global war that will lead to the same result?’ We are

already building air bases at enormous expense from North Africa to Greenland, from '

Germany to Japan. Does this mean “preventive war”? It was advocated by ex-Secretary
of the Navy Matthews in 1950 and more recently by Major General Robert Grow, ex-

military attaché i_n Moscow. General Grow’s diary, which was photostated ‘at Frankfurt, i

called ‘for war-on the USSR. His entry of March 27, A1951, reads: “. . . our paper , . .
deﬁnitely estimated actionthis year or before July ’52 . . . War! As soon as possible!
Now!” He has not been reprimanded, and was only criticised for his carelessness in

A not guarding his diary.

But enough of the dark side. How shall we guarantee that world war will not be I
"forced on us again? How can we return our government to full, peaceful negotiations
within theframework of the ‘United Nations? We must convince our country that there

will be no victors in another war — only vanquished — and that-ideas cannot be
stopped by bullets. “The more intelligent a man is the more . . . clearly he. discerns
that nomoral question can be settled by force?’ (William Jennings Bryan.)" We must

carry forward with increased energy the historic program of the Amercan Peace '

Movement. Peace will triumph if you and I demand it and work for it.

, We do not need to—work alone. .In Europe, Asia, Africa, the Soviet Union, and ,
China, as well as ‘here, people are vigorously discussing the need to disarm, to restore

the United Nations to the principle of unanimity based on a ﬁve-power pact of peace,

~ and to rebuild. The world’s people are watching “every move of statesmen"in relation
, Ito the disarmament proposals now before the new United Nations’ Commission, as, well
as the tendency to make N.A.T.O§ a substitute for the United Nations. ‘(Alvarez Del‘

Vayo, The Nation, March 22, 1952.) If any government refuses to meetthe V\"O‘l'l_.d:_VVidCi
demand for disarmament and reconstruction, such a government cannot last.

' The growing need and demand for world trade is an encouraging sign. The trade
deﬁcit and decline of living standards of France endangersthe position of various
French industries whose output exceeds domestic -demand. Therefore French business4
men have been meeting with representatives of Chambers of Commerce from other
European countries in the predicament caused by remilitarization and the “cold war3’_
An International Economic Conference of business leaders from East and West
met in Moscow this spring to revive East-West trade. India held an International Fair
in Bombay, January, 1952, with exhibits from both the eastern and western nations.
The Governor of Bombay in his opening speech expressed India’s. desire for economic
cooperation with all countries. ‘ A

As inﬂation grows and the economic outlook of militarized nations continues to
darken, the barriers against East-West trade are bound to fall.

Here at home this is an election year. “The moral, economic and social strangula-
tion of the people will continue and grow far worse if we do not speak .and'act in this
election year L . .” points out Rev. Stephen Fritchman, minister of First Unitarian
Church in Los Angeles. “They (our people) must not despair, for in their hands lies
the power to effect a mighty change, under American principles and with American
tools of democracy, next June or next November . . . It is little "-short of madness that
we even consider continuing policies that strike us down with low living standards,
tongue-tied professors, and dismissed physicians . . . To elect candidates who propose,
tolerate or advance such iniquity is to share responsibilityfor our self-immolation on
the altar of fear?’ Mr. F ritchman advises us to write our own platform to be sent to our
Congressmen -and demanded of our convention delegates. He suggests the "following
for this election year: ’ ‘ A" " 

/

First, Peace.

Let America declare peace and proceed to operate with all nations on ytheppremise
that no international problem needs war for a solution. “What is necessary is not
perfect agreement but only a method of living together.” (Quoted from Wall St.
Journal, November 1, 1951.) . -

Second, Substitute a Life-Economy for a Death-Economy.

It is destructive of our own survival that we tolerate an economy dependent "upon
billions for arms, armies and military operations. “One billion dollars‘spent,._. ‘.1.-.
in ﬁghting these ancient enemies of poverty and diease can be far more effective
than many» billions spent on arms to ﬁght Communists?’ '( Quoted from Dr. Ralph
W. Sockman.)

Third, ImmediateEnactment of Civil Rights.Legisla1t_ion for which allof America,
except remnants of the South, are now prepared. We can have racial democracy

When we took a leading part in establishing the United Nations Organization in
1945 we recognized that, since the two prevailing systems, capitalism and socialism,
had co-existed peaceably for more than 20 years, they could continue to do so. The
signing of the Charter was, in fact, a solemn declaration by governments with different
economic and political systems that they intended to rid the world of the scourge of
war and to achieve “international cooperation?’

The principle of unanimity among the Big Five Powers -— USA, China, France,
Britain, and USSR——was basic to the Charter provisions, and was. inserted as essential
to world peace. Peace through negotiations, based on respect for our own rights and
those of others, would mean a richer, more secure life for everyone.

The United Nations‘ Charter says: “The United Nations believesithat all nations ’
must come to the abandonment of the use of force and that the disarmament of nations I
is essential?’ ( Clause VIII.) To reach this goal we, the American people, will have to _

set our feet on the paths hewed out for us by earlier pioneers and peacemakers.

Thelpeace movement," which has not always succeeded inthe past, will triumph

because it does not depend on the good will or humanitarian attitude of world leaders."
It depends on the will of ordinary people. The peace /eﬁorts of each individual may r

seem small. The distances between us may seem great, but there is a growing unity of
purpose which draws the bonds close: a postcard came the other day from India to
California; an Indian had read in a Canadian’ newsletter of a pamphlet on the Japanese
Treaty written by a small Peace Club in California; he asked for a copy. And- so the
peace workers of the world draw together. A a

Thousands of our citizens came to this country to escape compulsory military service
and war, from earliest times right down to the refugees from Nazi Germany. They
came to get away from military pomp and ceremony, from gradations of rank, from
the unlimited power of war leaders, the blind obedience required of troops, the
disruption of family life, and the brutality, hardship and incalculable waste of war.

, Many came as dissenters from the injustices, inequities, and wars based on the
power-politics of their day. Mennonites and Quakers came as missionaries to the
common people, to "teach brotherhood and peace. They went unarmed and safe among
the Indian tribes, then as now, opposing all forms of violence. George Fox, who
founded the Religious Society of Friends in 1640, said to the common people who
followed him: . - '

“Be patterns, be examples in all countries, places, islands, nations, wherever you
come: that your carriage and life may preach among all sorts of people and to them:
that you will come to walk cheerfully over the world, answering that of God in

everyone?’

From the beginnings of our history, there have been paciﬁsts and peace organiza-
tions. By the nineteenth century world peace was one of the humanitarian aims of most
liberal people. By 1828 ﬁfty different peace societies had become active, and they

united to form the American Peace Society. By 1836 most New England Churches had

passed resolutions favoring peace societies, and 800 ministers were pledged annually to
speak on peace. By 1840 over a million and a quarter copies of publications opposing
war and militarism had been distributed. A continual ﬂow of anti-war petitions were
sent to Congress.

Peace programs throughout the nineteenth century pointed out the need for a code
of international law and advocated the establishment of a Congress of Nations to settle
diﬂerences by negotiation and treaties.

American peacemakers in 1841 extended a friendly hand to peacemakers of other
lands when a group, meeting in Boston, organized the ﬁrst International Peace Con
gress which convened in London two years later. Similar Congresses have been held
every few ,years from that time to "the present day. At the 1849 Paris Peace Congress.
presided over by Victor Hugo, Americans played a prominent role. Many leading
Americans have been active in every world peace congress, sometimes with and some-
.times without the friendly interest of their government. Our peace movement has
always sought international allies through conferences and cultural interchange’.

The first international peace organization, the League of Universal Brotherhood,
was founded by the American paciﬁst Elihu Burritt and some English colleagues in .

- 3

 

 
  

 

P1846. Burritt was a blacksmith, and his League won considerable support from labor.‘

The League urged a parliament of European and American working men for disarmae
ment and a Congress of Nations. As a result of Burritt’s work the League spread to
France and later to German-speaking countries. By 1848 it had grown to 25,000
members in the United States. ' -

When the Mexican war broke out in 1846, the peace movement came into conﬂict
with the Government. Peacemakers were accused by the President of the United States,
James Polk, of treasonably “giving aid and comfort to the enemy?’ They split in the
early days of the war, some supporting the Government, some denouncing it. This war,
like most wars, was not understood by the people during the immediate crisis because
they were misinformed, propagandized, and confused by slogans of high moral
purpose. Yet as time passed they came to understand that they had been misled.
President Grant characterized this war as “one of the most unjust ever waged by a
stronger against a weaker neighbor?’

When Texas was annexed, the boundary line was left open for settlement by
negotiation. Shortly" afterward President Polk, without any negotiation, ordered the
army of the United States under General Taylor to occupy the territory under dispute.
War began with a minor incident. People were told at the time that our, soldiers had
been attacked on our territory and that we were ﬁghting a war of defense. The testi-
mony of Capt. Thornton, commander of the party involved in the incident, proved this

to be false. Abraham Lincoln exposed this falsehood in Congress and was called

“traitor” by the reactionaries- His stand cost himlhis re-election to Congress.

One year later John C. Calhoun stated in reference to the Congressional action
starting the war, “We had not a particle of evidence that the Republic of Mexico‘ had
made war against the United States?’ (Feb. 24, 1847.) On January 31, 1848, with the
war still continuing, the House passed this resolution: “Resolved, that the Mexican War
was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States?’

The people were told they were ﬁghting for peace. President Polk’s organ, the
Washington Union, declared, “Henceforth we must seek peace and compel it bv. inﬂict-
ing on our enemies all the evils of war?’ The people were told many stories of Mexican
atrocities, yet General Kearney in his War Department report’ dated March 15, 1847
said, “They (the Mexicans) have been most shamefully and cruelly abused by our own
people, by volunteers. Had they not resisted they would have been unworthy of the
name of men?’ Our Government told the Mexican people that we were liberating them.
A document distributed to the Mexicans on July 9, 1846 by General Taylor stated, “We
come to overthrow the tyrants who have destroyed your liberties, but we come to make
no war upon the people of Mexico?’

The peace movement and thousands of unorganized individuals sharply criticized
and opposed this war, and exercised their ri-ght to haveva voice in determining
American policy. Freedom to criticise our Government and suggest alternatives to the

domestic and foreign policies currently in effect was guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. ‘

Government, American-style, was designedto serve the people and not the reverse.

Henry David Thoreau wrote his Essay on Civil Disobedience, which inﬂuenced
the Gandhi movement in India fifty years later. He refused to paytaxes for war and
slavery. Daniel Webster and John, Quincy Adams joined those opposing the war.
Senator Charles Sumner drafted a resolution calling for the withholding of supplies
and the withdrawal of troops from Mexico. The great negro liberator, Frederick
Douglass, called for a mass campaign with vigor and forthrightness: “Let the press,
the pulpit, the people at large unite at once; and let petitions ﬂood the halls of Congress
by the million asking for the instant recall of our forces from Mexico?’

Petitions did ﬂood the halls of Congress; one contained 40,000 signatures. Many
of them were signed at street meetings. Peace societies were joined in their efforts by
anti-slavery forces in the North. Prompted by the pressure of the peace movement, the
Massachusetts Legislature passed a resolution aﬂirming that “. . . such a war of con-
quest, so hateful in its objects, so wanton, unjust, and unconstitutional in origin and
character, must be regarded as a war against freedom, against justice, against the

Union, and against the free States; and a regard for the true interest and highest honor

of the country, not less that the impulse of Christian duty, should arouse all good
citizens to join in efforts to arrest this war?’ Thus our peace movement was developed
in a struggle against violent conquest. It survived and grew.

Signiﬁcant victories were won by the American peace forces in the nineteenth
century. U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Oregon border disputes were successfully settled by
arbitration as a result of peace petitioning from 1837 to 1845. This petition campaign
was led by distinguished men and women from both England and the United States
who worked together in a common effort. In 1846 the ﬁrst proposal to the government

rohibiting the manufacture and sale of armaments was put forward by Joshua Blan-
shard, a leading Quaker. Americans determined on peace succeeded in educating many

different Administrations, between 1816 and 1893, in the arts of preventing wars and

making friends abroad. They had arbitration clauses written into many commercial
treaties,‘ and in forty different conﬂict situations they persuaded the Government to
arbitrate all outstanding difficulties. They achieved, despite all manner of pressure from
shipbuilders on the Great Lakes, the unarmed border between our country and Canada,
which is honored by people of goodwill the world over. The International Joint Com-
mission established with Canada has settled approximately 20 boundary disputes, to
the satisfaction of both nations.

Conquest of Cuba in our early history was avoided, and in 1873 peace groups
prevented war against Spain in Cuba.

The ﬁrst international convention for the reform and codiﬁcation of international
law was organized in 1872 by Elihu Burritt and Dr. James Miles.

The original advocate of a World Court, .Willia1n Ladd, was the ﬁrst President of
the American Peace Society. His proposals, were brought to fruition when the ﬁrst
Hague Tribunal was established at the end of the century.

In their educational work the peace forces went far beyond their own members
and helped awaken good will and human brotherhood in wide sections of the popula-

tion. They devoted energy, scholarship and imagination to books and programs that
would foster love of science, the arts," andpeace in the great free publicschool system.
Opposition to compulsory military service and to any and all attempts to militarize the
schools, begun in the nineteenth century, is one of the people’s strongest movements
today. The peace movement has always opposed militarism and upheld government by
civilians. P -

It is true the peace movement failed to -prevent the Civil War. It failed because its

program had been primarily one of moral suasion and had not realistically dealt with .

the economic struggle and the slave system which were the main issues in the secession
and resultant war. Though sincerely working to.end slavery, paciﬁsts split over the war
issue. Too few had thought out early enough alternative non-violent methods by which
the economic system of the North might have replaced that of the South and by which
freedom for slaves and justice for all could have been promoted. And so war came.
Today much slavery still exists around the world and we must determinedly ﬁnd
peaceful ways of ending it. i

The end "of the 19th. century marked a sharp breaking point with traditional‘

United States foreign policy. The United States emerged as a world power and, con-
trary to the principles of the American people, embarked on an aggressive path to
obtain raw materials, markets, cheap labor, and areas for economic investment. '

By 1900 our Government had annexed in the Paciﬁc Cuam, Wake Island, Midway,"

Samoa, Alaska, the Aleutians, the Philippines, and the Hawaiian Islands. In Hawaii a
provisional government headed by Americans was set up after Queen Liliuokalani was
deposed by American marines. President Cleveland, publicly condemned steps leading.
to annexation, and the Congress passed a resolution condemning our diplomatic
representative who “illegally aided in overthrowing the Constitutional government of
the Hawaiian Islands?’

Propagandists urged a great expansion beyond our own borders. This wasclearly
expressed by Senator Beveridge, Republican of Indiana when he said,“The Philippines
are ours forever . .- . and just beyond the Philippines are China’s illimitable markets.
We will not retreat from either. The Paciﬁc is the ocean of the commerce of the future

and most future wars will be conﬂicts for commerce?’ ‘

The Spanish-American war began in 1898 when the United States intervenediri
the Cuban revolt against Spain. That revolt: was caused by a tariff-‘crisis which ‘had
created widespread unemployment and suffering in Cuba. Buildings and factories were

‘ - earth and heaven. It is a birthright. It belongs . .

American trade amounting to 100 million dollars per year was disrupted. Business
interests wanted action. Hearst and Pulitzer newspapers began a competitive campaign
to increase circulation by publishing sensational lies and appeals for war. When the
American battleship Maine was mysteriously blown up in Havana harbor, although
there was no proof that the Spaniards had anything to do ‘with it, the people were

stirred into shouting for war, a war for Cuban independence.

However, “American historians are today agreed that the war with Spain could
have been avoided with honor:’ said Samuel Bemis F lagg, Yale historian, in his book
Diplomatic History of the United States. In negotiations, Spain agreed to practically all
the United States’ requests in an attempt to keep peace, including thegranting of Cuban
independence. “But? said Charles Beard in his book, Idea of the National Interest,
“there are other forces at work who had other interests besides Cuban independence.
The mere emancipation of Cuba would not have given the United States a naval base
at Guantanamo . . . nor would it have furnished an occasion /or annexing Puerto Rico
. . . or for acquiring the Philippines as a naval base for commercial expansion in the
Orient.”

The peoplelwere told by President McKinley that annexation would bring good
government and liberation to backward peoples. Commenting on this, George Boutwell,
President of the newly-formed Anti-Imperialist League, asked, “Was there ever a
despot who did not plead inexcuse and justiﬁcation of his usurpation, the incompe-,
tency and incapacity of those over whom he exercised his power?” This League was
led by such outstanding Americans as Andrew Carnegie, Grover Cleveland, Charles
Francis Adams, William James, Carl Shurz, and many more.

Senator George Hoar of Massachusetts said on April 17, 1900, “Our imperialistic
friends . . . talk about giving good government. Why, Mr. President, that, one phrase
conveys to a free man and a free people the most stinging of insults. In that little
phrase, as in a seed, is contained the seed of all despotism and of all tyranny. Govern-
ment is not a gift. Free government is not to begiven by all the blended powers of
. to human nature itself. There‘ can
be no good government but self-government?’ Americans seeking peace have always
upheld the right of self-determination of all peoples, and opposed conquest of territory
and interference in the internal aﬂairs of other nations.

We fought in the Philippines until 1907 and annexed them at a cost of 20,000
lives and $600,000,000. “When the Filipinos resisted, as men who would be free will.
always resist oppression, they were‘ conquered by the irresistible power of the United
States . . . Tens of thousands of Filipinos have been slaughtered, many have been
tortured; their homes have been destroyed and their families dispersed; and all this
because the Philippine people did what Americans would have done, if Americans had
been . . . (treated) in like manner3’—_Col. Charles R. Codman, Oct. 15, 1904.’

William Jennings Bryan warned, “Imperialism brings with it militarism . . .

militarism means a gigantic expenditure daily growing. It means an increase in '

government of the power of aristocratic and privileged classes. Militarism means the
profusion of taxpayers’ money everywhere except in the taxpayers’ own home, and

militarism must mean war?’

.Moorﬁeld Storey, who learned his ﬁrst lessons in racial justice and anti:
imperialism as secretary to Charles Sumner, reminded Philippine investors that the
millions sunk into the slave system had proved to be mere “dust in the balance against

.' 7

the irresistible demands of human freedom” and such would be the case in the

Philippines.

Carl Shurz addressing a peace meeting in Philadelphia on February 22, 1900 said,
“There can be no question as to the responsibility for this disgraceful conﬂict, and all
the blood spilled in it. Those who had the power to prevent or stop it by being simply
faithful to the principles the American people have hitherto so proudly professed .\ . .
will be held forever answerable for this wanton and wicked war by impartial history,
and no sanctimonious cant, no cunning sophistry, can disguise theirguilt or save them

from that awful judgment?

Inhis autobiography Mark Twain reasserted one of our greatest traditions. He
wrote “. . . that if there was any valuable difference between being an American and
a monarchist it lay in the theory that the American could decide for himself what is
patriotic and what isn’t; whereas the king could dictate the »monarchist’s patriotism for
him. . . . If I thought it an unrighteous war I would say so. If I were invited to shoulder
a musket in that cause and march under that flag I should declinef’

The peace movement grew phenomenally during the ﬁrst ﬁfteen years of the
twentieth century as the evils of militarism and mass warfare became more and more
striking. The cause of peace became universally popular. Americans worked for a
World Court, a League of Nations, a code of international law, and arbitration treaties
as means of winning lasting peace. The peace-movement has always advocated settle-
ment of disputes by law, not by violence. Three thousand people attended the Thirteenth

International Peace Congress in Boston in 1904, representing 200 organizations of all ~

types. Three years later, in New York, the first National Peace Congress drew promi-
nent political, religious, and social leaders from all overthe United States. The peace
movement had members from almost every church denomination.

In 1910 the World Peace Foundation was launched with Edward Ginn and the
presidents of Harvard, Brown, Swarthmore and Stanford at its head. This organization
published and distributed over 300,000 pamphlets every year and carried on a wide
educational campaign. Educators promoted the formation of the American School
Peace League and the Intercollegiate Peace Association, as well. '

A triumph of the peace movement was scored by William Jennings Bryan in 1913.
Then Secretary of State, be translated the popular will to peaceinto arbitration treaties
which he successfully negotiated with twenty-two countries.

The Socialists of the period, led by Eugene Debs, concerned themselves with
probing for the causes of war and with campaigns to educate the people for basic
economic changes which would end imperialism and poverty. Convinced that the
working people of all countries could prevent the outbreak of a world war, Debs
preached the ‘abolition of government protection for foreign investments and the
abolition of private proﬁt in armament making. He emphasized the importance of

working people of all countries refusing to ﬁght each other and advocated that a

declaration of war be made only by popular vote.

When war broke out between the rival powers of Europe in 1914, most Americans

. were convinced we could stay out. Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1915 on the promise’

of ‘keeping us out of war. Early in his administration German submarine attacks on
our ships inﬂamed popular feeling and furnished the occasion for our entering the
war. It may be questioned, however, whether this was, the determining cause.

, The year 1916 was the most prosperous in the history of American industry and
ﬁnance to that time. Between August 1914 and February 1917 more than 101/2 billion
dollars worth of goods were exported. The Allies had established a central purchasing
bureau in our country and spent on an-average of ten million dollars a day. (From
J. K. Turner’s Shall It Be Again?) During the remaining period of neutrality,
81,900,000,000 in loans was extended privately in the United States to the Allied
governments?’ (S. B. Flagg, Diplomatic History of the ‘United States.) ’

At the beginning of 1917 the credit'of the Allies was virtually exhausted. Some of

the loans already made had been unsecured and the announcement was made that
henceforth Allied loans would have to be wholly unsecured?’ (Eng1ebrecht——-Merchants
of Death.) Shortly thereafter we entered the war.

Robert LaFollette led the ﬁght for peace in Congress. In a four hour speech he
showed that not Germany alone but all the-belligerents were at fault. He and ﬁfty-ﬁve
other members of both houses voted against the Declaration of War. He fought against
conscription. The No-Conscription League issued 100,000 circulars opposing conscrip-‘
tion in June 1917, but nearly all organized agitation in favor of conscientious ‘objectors

disappeared under threat of the espionage law. Opposition was so pronounced that the '

Government stiﬂed free ex ression of o inion and sent man 0 onents of the war to

jail. The Civil Liberties Bureau was raided by -the Department of Justice in 1918 on
suspicion of “hindering prosecution of the war?’

Although President Wilson had said on May 27, 1916, “The objects on both sides
are virtually the same? Eugene Debs was sent to jail for his Canton, Ohio,,speech
against our entrance into the war. “I have a copyof these treaties”(the Secret Treaties)
said Debs, “showing that the purpose of the Allies is exactly the purpose of the Central
Powers, and that is the spoliation of the weaker nations that has always been the
purpose of war. Wars throughout history have been fought for conquest and plunder?’

According to War Department ﬁgures, 171,000 young men evidently saw no point
in the war and evaded the draft. ‘Of these 64,693 claimed exemption as conscientious
objectors; 450 of them went to jail, while thousands were forced into the army, where
many were treated with malicious brutality. ‘

New peace forces had been aroused. Dr. Carrie Chapman Catt organized the

Women’s Peace Partyiin 1915. Forty-seven American women were sent to the Hague
for an International Congress that same year. Women came from twelve countries and
Jane Addams presided over solemn, inspiring sessions where the women planned how
to bring organized pressure of the neutral countries to bear on the belligerents. The
delegates to this Congress braved ostracism, ridicule, and imprisonment to prove that
women are capable of putting humanity before any government. They sat side by side
