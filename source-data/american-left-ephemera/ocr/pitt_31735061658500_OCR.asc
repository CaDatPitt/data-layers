unarmed peasants because they were his enemies, his
“prisoners of war”, should now be so vitally interested in
the liberation of these very peasants, Vonsiatsky replies:

“There is nothing strange in that. In the last 17 years
I have learned a great deal. I have learned much from
Hitler. I shall beat the Bolsheviks at their own game.
In order to achieve the ‘Russian National-Socialist Revo-
lution’, we need the support of the Russian workers and
peasants. . . .”

While Vonsiatsky is prepared to kill millions of work-
ers and peasants, whom he still regards as his enemies, he
thinks it is the “correct tactics” to call them his “friends”
in public. He even added recently a sub—tit1e to the name
“All-Russian Fascist Party”——-“The Russian National-
Revolutionary Workers and Peasants Party”.

There isn’t the slightest doubt that Vonsiatsky’s aim is
to “free Russia” by returning the land to the landowners
and the factories to the bosses. He is even more ambitious
than that. How about the crown of the tsar of All
Russia? Vonsiatsky smiles. Mildly he says no. It is
badtactics. But every once in a while he publishes in the
Fascist insinuating letters from “prominent” Russians in
which he is called upon to don the crown of the Russian
tsar. .

In November, 1934, issue of the Fascist there is a
letter from .“Baroness” Anastasia Vassilyevna von Andre-
sin, in which she writes:

“Dear Editor:

“A few days ago someone told me:

“Baroness, what are you doing? Whom are you de-

10

 

 

fending? Don’t you know that Vonsiatsky " is after the
crown? . . . ‘

“To which I replied:

“ ‘The ways of God are unknown. If God wills, he will
don the crown. . . . Vonsiatsky, in spite of his youth,
may be more clever than Napoleon, Hitler and Mussolini
. . . God will help him. . . . He will show the path to the
Russian Eagle . . . where and how to ﬂy . . . and what
to do for the glory of Russia. . . .’ ”

Of c-ourse the “baroness” and her fellow White Guards
expect more from Marion B. Ream with her millions,
from William Randolph Hearst and Sir Henri Detering,
the British oil magnate, who have long been active in
ﬁnancing counter—revolutionary activities in the Soviet
Union than from some mythical “God”.

Kill Kirov . . . Shoot Stalin!

How does Vonsiatsky and his band propose to “free”
Russia from the “yoke” of the Reds?

The answer is-———through terror, through the assassina-
tion of Soviet leaders, and through plotting war on the
Soviet Union. -

Vonsiatsky’s group is working in cooperation with the
German and Japanese Governments and it is well known
that the German Government has recently attempted to
send some groups of terrorists to the Soviet Union under
the guise of “German political refugees.”

The July, 1934, issue of the Fascist carries the follow-
ing story:

“An unsuccessful attempt of the G.P.U. to catch

‘_‘Captain Ivanov-Krivkov, a member of the All-Russian
Fascist Party,‘ has crossed the Polish-Soviet border in the

“Ivanov-Krivkov is an active member of the Party and
several months ‘ago he went there to carry on fascist
propaganda. . V A

“He was spotted, however, by the G.P.U. -and was
forced to escape from the Soviet Union.

“Ivanov-Krivkov is now detained by the Polish authori-
ties and the Central Headquarters of the All-Russian Fas-
cist_Party has. already taken measures to release him.”

An‘ even more gruesome story of White Guard terror-
ism in the U.S.S.R. is published in the February, .1934,
issue of the Fascist: A .

' '“Mil'itant "Work in Western Russia!” ,

“On October 7 the Fascist Trio No. A"-5 caused the

“The editorial office of the Fascist wishes to announce
that it is in receipt of 1,500 zlotys ("about $300") to be
delivered to Boris Koverda when he is discharged from
prison. The money is a present from Mr. Vonsiatsky.” '

Who is this Boris Koverda whom Vonsiatsky supports
with money? He is the murderer of Voykov, the Soviet
Ambassador to Poland. Voykov _was murdered by K0-
verda in‘I926in Warsaw. _ The ‘murderer was sentenced
to onlya short term of imprisonment by the Polish courts.
. Vonsiatsky also supports the “National League of the
New Generation”. In supporting this group, he has the
active cooperation of Sir Henri _Deterding of the Royal
Dutch'Shell Oil’ Company. ' . ,

The “National League of the New Generation” is the
most ruthless White Guard terrorist organization operat—_
ing against the U.S.S.R. The League has set itself the
task of "organizing the most reckless elements among the
younger generation which has grown up in exile.‘ ‘The’
headquarters of this organizati—on is’ the Paris Bureau of
the notorious Industrial Party “Torgprom” which organ-
ized sabotage activities in the Soviet=Union some time
ago.- This organization works in direct collaboration with
the French and German fascists. Military questions are
dealt with openly at their meetings. A great number of
the members are recruited from the Scout associations,
of which there are three in Paris alone; the _“National
Organization of the Russian Boy Scouts”, the A“Russian
Pathﬁnders” and the “Russian Sokol”- 

In all these associations which are openly under the
patronage of the International Council of the Y.M".C.A.,
hatred of the Soviet Union is taught systematically.

Union, which is expressed by their leaders in their press.

On November I, 1934, Za Rossiyu, the organ of this
“National League of the,New Generation”, published in’
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, printed the following editorial:

“Kirov in Leningrad must be removed. We must also
doaway with Kossior and Postyshev in the South of
Russia.

“Brothers, fascists, if you can’t get to Stalin, kill Gorki,
kill the poet D'emiyan Biedni, kill Kaganovich. . . .”

_ On December I, 1934, Sergei Kirov, one of the most
energetic leaders in the Soviet Union, was killed by Leonid
N ikolayev, a member of a terrorist organization.

This was the sixth murder of a high Soviet ofﬁcial com-
mitted by members of White Guard terrorist bands.

, In 1923, the Soviet Ambassador to Switzerland, Vo-
rovski, was murdered in Lausanne.

In 1925, the Soviet diplomatic courier, Nette, was mur-
dered in Latvia.
In 1926, Voykov was killed in Poland.

In 1932, an employee of the Soviet Consulate in P0-
land was murdered in Lemberg.

In I933, Esthonian fascists and. Russian White Guards
carried out a murderous attack upon the Soviet Embassy
in Helsingfors, Finland.

In I934-—Sergei Kirov. ,

' After the abominable murder of Kirov, the Soviet
Government took steps to put an end to the activities of
the terrorist bands ‘operating within the Soviet Union.
It gave orders that all impending trials for attempted or
achieved acts of terrorism should be dealt with at once

14

  

by summary procedure before courts martial and that the
sentences should be enforced immediately. .
As a result, 117 White Guards and counter-revolution-
ists caught red-handed were executed!
The execution of these terrorists called forth a cam-
paign of slander in the capitalist countries on a scale
hitherto unheard of. The capitalistpress could ﬁnd but

little space to report the murder of Kirov,‘ but accorded-

a great deal of space to expressions of “indignation”
roused by “the vengeance” taken by the S-oviet Govern-
ment. William»Randolph Hearst, Fascist No. I of the
United States, who works hand in glove with this band
of White Guard cut—throats and assassins, cried murder
all over his yellow press.

While, however, the capitalist press was denouncing the
Soviet “act of revenge”, while the liberals and the so-
cialists were organizing united front “protest” meetings
in cooperation with the White Guards, Vonsiatsky and his
gang were jubilant.

“Kirov is ﬁnished !” exclaimed Vonsiatsky in the March,
1935, issue of the Fascist. “Next shot made must be
aimed at Stalin——a signal to imu-rrection!” A

“Not loud,” he continues, “was the shot of our brothe
Nikolayev but it resounded throughout the world. . . .

“Hats off, Russian people, before Nikolayev’s fresh
grave. . . . “Long live the immortal hero, Nikolayev !”

Plotting Intervention: Vonsiatsky and Hearst

Terrorism isnot Vonsiatsky’s only stockin trade. With
the aid of Japanese and Nazi imperialists he hopes to do
bigger and better things. ' ‘l

“Should there be a war between Japan and Soviet
Russia.,” he write in the Fascist, “we Russian fascists
shall be in the front lines, marching shoulder to shoulder
with the Japanese soldiers. . . . Our propagandists and
organizers must be ready for that moment. . . .

“One of our important, if not the most important,
strategetic points in the ﬁght against the U.S.S.R.,” he
lemphasizes, “is the Far East. Harbin is the strongest
fortress 0-f Russian fascism today.”
> "In the meantime, while waiting for theday when he will

imperialists, he spreads pro—]apanese propaganda in the

In this he has the most active-“cooperation :of William

supports a regular White Guard army in the East. In
Manchuria alone she can mobilize 150,000 White Guard
Russians. ,

The White Guard colony in Harbin is armed and or-

ganized along military lines. At the head of this army
of counter-revolution—the shock troops of Japanese im-
perialism-—stands the notorious tsarist bandit, “Ataman”
Semionov.
‘ Semionov’s connection with the Japanese General Staff
—hit«herto kept a secret by both sides——was recently
brought out into the open by none other than Vonsiatsky
himself. ‘

When Vonsiatsky came to Japan, he succeeded, with
the aid of Marion Ream’s money, in buying the fascist
newspaper Nash Put and in effecting a union with C. V.
Rodzayevski, general secretary of the Harbin Russian
Fascist Party. This union, however, was short-lived.
Vonsiatsky and Rodzayevski split on two issues: anti-
Semitism and the question of Semionov.

Rodzayevski is an anti—Semite who believes that the
Jews ought to be exterminated at once. Vonsiatsky is also
an anti—Semite who believes in the extermination of Jews.
Unlike Rodzayevski, however, he wants to do it quietly,
not to make an issue of the Jewish question, so that he
may get the support of rich Jewish bankers in America
who are known to support fascist groups in the U.S.

Questioned by the reporter of the Bridgeport Sunday
Herald as to his attitude toward Jews, Vonsiatsky replied:

“If the Jews want to be our friends and helpers we
shall welcome them gladly. . . ’. Here is where Hitler and
I disagree. I am a great admirer, however, of Mussolini

18

 

r4’/w,\>1&y0-‘

and Hitler and their methods of combatting Corn-
munism. . . .”.

This interview was given, of course, -for American con-
sumption. It isquite mild in tone. At the “conference”
of Russian fascists held in March in New Yior City, he
was a little more explicit than that. '

“The attitude. of the All-Russian Fascist organization
towards the Jews,” he said, “dependslprimarily upon the
attitude of the Jews towards.the Russian. fascist move-
ment....” ..- ; ‘V i ‘

What does that mean? It means that if the rich Jewish
bankers in America, like their German brothers (the
Jacob G-oldschmidts and others), will furnish the millions
of dollars about which Vonsiatsky bragged when he made
his alliance with Rodzayevski in Manchuria, they will’ be
allowed to participate in the fascist movement.

Even that, however, does not explain fully Vonsiatsy’s
attitude towards the Jewish question.

What, then, is the truth?

In the July, 1934, issue of N azia, V onsiatsky’s theore-
tical organ published in Harbin and Shanghai, and edited
by Rodzayevski, we read: .

“A Provocation Concerning the Jewish Question”.

“Our enemies never miss an opportunity to sow dis-
sention in our ranks. Having found out that there are
minor differences between us and Brother Vonsiatsky
concerning the Jewish question, they choose to provoke us
on this score.

“The truth is, however, that having taken into consid-
eration the fact that the All-Russian Fascist Party is oper-
ating in the United States, a country governed by Jews and

Jewish question. . .” r '

Premature! '

The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reports the following
story from Harbin:

“The slaying of a Jewish boy at Harbin by a group of
White Russians was called to the attention of Sir Alex-
ander,Cadogan, British Minister to China, by N. E. B.
Ezra, editor of Israel’: Messenger.

“Sir Alexander was told that Mr. Igguchi, a high‘
Japanese police oﬂicial at Harbin, had issued a statement
to the press in connection with the kidnapping and murder
of another Jew, Simon Kaspe, a French citizen, inwhich
Igguchi said the crime was justiﬁed.

“ ‘He stated that in his opinion Kaspe was put to death
by White Russians because he was a Jew and that the
White Russians, exiled from their homeland, have griev-
ances against the Jewish people for ruining their country
and identifying themselves with ‘Communism.

“ ‘Because of these circumstances,’ Igguchi said, ‘the
killers are entitled to leniency.’ ” i ,

The murder of Kaspe was not, of course, the only
murder of Jews that the White ‘Guards committed within
recent years in Harbin with the approval of the Japanese
officials. It was the most -gruesome, however, and most
publicized in the United States. ‘A group of prominent
American Jews sent a protest to the Japanese Ambassador
at Washington. Vonsiatsky was irked. How about the
millions of dollars he promised to furnish when he was
in Harbin? How can he now approach the Jewish bank-
ers in the United States? What will the Jewish bankers

say? Will they still offer him -cash to combat Commu-
nism? Why make an issue of the Jewish question _just
now? 

This was the beginning of Vonsiatsky’s rift with Rod-
zayevski. The quarrel with Sernionov caused the ﬁnal
break.

“Ataman” Semionov, as I have already pointed out,
is a hireling of the Japanese militarists. He is designated
by them as the “Commander” of the White Guard forces
upon whom Japan counts to commence the offensive
against the Workers’ Republic. Vonsiatsky, while in Har-
bin, tried to step into Semionov’s boots. The latter, being
in the conﬁdence of the Japanese General Staff, was suc-
cessful in frustrating Vonsiatsy’s ambition. V-onsiatsky
was peeved. He ordered Rodzayevski to break with
Semionov. Rodzayevski, who, while receiving money
from Vonsiatsky, was also in the pay of the Japanese
General’ Staff, refused. Vonsiatsky threatened to kill
Semionov; J ' V .

“We must put‘ a bu1l_et_into the "head of Semionov‘, the

At the Shrine of Hitler

Vonsiatsky’s visit to Hitler was much more success-
ful. He was acclaimed and feted by Alfred Rosenberg,
Hit1er’s chief foreign spokesman himself. Rosenberg
even inﬂuenced Vonsiatsky to patch up his differences with
Rodzayevski. After all, why quarrel over the spoils.
Aren’t they both inspired by the same noble spirit——to kill
Communists, Socialists, Liberals and Jews? Let them
ﬁrst defeat Soviet Russia and then there will be enough
loot for everybody.

That Rosenberg should be interested in Vonsiatsky’s
patching up differences with Rodzayevski is not at all
strange since Germany is the most obvious ally of Japan.
The Hitler—Rosenberg scheme for German—Polish invasion
of the Soviet Ukraine is the dearest dream of Nazi im-
perialism. The invasion, to be successful, must coincide
with Japan’s attack from the East. In the last two years
Germany and Japan have taken little trouble to conceal
their common interest in attacking Russia.

In fact, long before he came to power, Hitler wrote:

“We National-Socialists begin where Germany stopped
six centuries ago. We are completing the century-long
movement of the German race to the South and West of
Europe and turning our gaze to the lands of the East. . . .
We have in view Russia and the territory under its
control.”

Like Japan, the Nazis have been supporting and nursing
a large group of Russian White Guards who are to be
used as the Nazi shock troops in the war with Soviet
Russia. p

Even six months before Hitler took power it was known

22

 

 

 

that a group of Russian White Guards were on the pay-
roll of the Brown House in Munich. The group is headed
by Bumanski, a former ofﬁcer in the Wrangel army with
a shady past; Taboritzky, a former tsarist officer who
murdered the former Russian emigre Nabokov in Berlin;
Talberg, secretary of the terrorist organization, the
“Brotherhood of Russian Truth”, that has been sending
terrorists into Soviet Russia, and Knolin, the White Guard
writer.

The Nazi specialist for “Ukrainian matters” is the
White Guard, Colonel Poltavetz Ostranitza, who makes

regular reports to Nazi headquarters on “Ukrainian ‘

aﬁ’airs”.

Recently the White Guards in Berlin have formed a
military organization known as the “Rond”. At the head
of the “Rond” stands the notorious Baltic adventurer,
Svetozaroff (Pelchau). Associated with him are the no-
torious spies, Muratoff (Snadmann), Mlle. Runge and
Meller—Zakomelsky.

While in Berlin, Vonsiatsky formed close ties with the
“Rond”. He had several conferences with Rosenberg
and Svetozaroff. Participating in these conferences were
also Gleb Galetski, the representative of the Ukrainian
White Guard organization known as “Soyuz Mladoros—
sov” ; A. A. Averkiev, a. member of the council of Rus-
sian Fascists in Berlin; N. R. Kastel, “the Chief of the
General Staff”; Count Pavel Avalov, the leader of the
Russian Fascists in Berlin; and Count S. Obolenski, rep-
resenting the Ukrainian terrorists.

While in Europe Vonsiatsky also visited “Czechoslo-
vakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Italy and France.

23

 
   

In Hungary he made contacts with A. Rash, the
.“.Fuhrer” ofthe « Hungarian National Socialists. In
France he carried on negotiations with the head of the
“Soyuz Mladorossov”, A. L. Kazem-Bek.

In an interview given to the Tsarski Vestnik» (Tsarist
News), published in Belgrade, Vonsiatsky described his
visit to Berlin thus: . » V R V

“I am amazed at the spirit of contemporary Germany.
. . . I saw how on a Sunday, on Reichskanzler Plantz,
storm-troopers came out to meet the Hitler girls. The
girls met the storm-troopers with banners. The storm-

- troopers sing songs which end with the words ‘blue eyes,

golden locks, preserve your country for better times. . . .’
The girls reply: ‘_Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles!
“This example. of patriotism is infecting the. Russian
exiles- -Ifelt it when I spoke in Berlin before an. a~udi.,-
ence of 3,o00_White Russians. _, — ’ p . -

marily for the Germans. We can learn from the Nazis,

selves” is, of course, a lot of hot air. He is a willing
tool of Alfred Rosenberg. Rosenberg in turn works in
close cooperation with Sir Henri Deterding, the British
oil magnate, who suppliesmuch of the cash needed to
carry on terrorist activities in the U.S.S.R.

Sir Deterding, who is still mourning the Baku oil ﬁelds
that thevGeorgian workers have taken away from him, has
long been bending every effort to build a front against
the Soviet Union. ‘Germany and Poland are the horses
on which he is betting. l ' 3

Some time ago 400 Polish miners lost their jobs in
France and were sent back to Poland. The Polish Gov-
ernment immediately retaliatedfby suing two French di-
rectors of the Zyradov textile mill on the ground that they
had. swindled the stockholders and the state. ‘The “Zyraf—'
dov affair”, as it came to be kn-own, was played up big
in Germany in an attempt to estrange Poland from France.

According to the Freie —Weltbuhrte of Prague, however,
the whole business, not only the “Zyradov aﬁair” but also
th'e"Po1ish-German reprochement, is the creation of Sir
Henri"Deterding, who is working for a German—Polish-
Hungarian alliance against the Soviet Union and is re—.
ceiving cooperation from the British Foreign Office.

Sir Deterding, according to the Prague paper, keeps
on his payroll several agents in Poland——arnoI1g others,
Wozniaski _and Avalo-ff, two notorious Russian fascists.

. The British Metropolitan Vickers (whose agent, Alan

Monkhouse, was recently -expelled from the Soviet Union
for espionage and sabotage activities) and the Westing-
house Saxby, whose investments in Poland are controlled
by Sir Henri, furnish the money. = » ’

25-

  

 

Like Germany, Poland, too, has recently effected a close
alliance with Japan- At the time of _Iapan’s invasion of
Manchuria, Marshall Pilsudski, Poland’s aged dictator,
was in constant communication with Japan; Japanese
missions were dispatched to the Baltic States on unmis-
takable errands. -

' Robert.Del1,’ veteran‘ British liberal correspondent, re-
ports in the magazine, Living Age, that the Polish Ukrain-
ian White Guards( followers of the not-orious pogrom
instigator, Petlura) whom the Poles have harbored for
I6.years seem now to be -on excellent terms with Pilsud-
ski’s government——and with M r. Ito, Japanese Ambassar
dor t.o Poland. These Ukrainians have protested against
the admission of Soviet Russia into the League of
Nations but they made no protest against the foreign
minister, Colonel Beck’s repudiation of the national mi-
norities treaties. .

“One wonders,” says Dell, “what they have been prom-
ised. Ukrainian independence? How can they attach any
value to the promises of the Polish Government or Mr.
Ito? The sinister aspect of the situation is that the aim
of these people is war against Russia. If the hopes of
Ukrainian indepiendence has been held out, its condition
must be a Japanese victory over Russia.”

The "Intellectual" Face of Russian Fascism in the U.S.A.

 

While it is Vonsiatsky’s function to organize terrorist ,

activities in the Soviet Union, to assassinate Soviet lead-
ers, and train soldiers for intervention, the function of
the “United Russian» National Organizations in America”
is to pull strings in Washington and spread propaganda

26.

 

against the Soviet‘ Union. The “United Russian National
Organizations in America”, whose ofﬁces are at 4 Colum-
bus Circle, New York City, is a very inﬂuential organ-
ization. It has intimate connections with. American
“society” and the leading circles of Washington.

The head of this organization is the anti-Semitic ped—
dler of the fake “Protocols of Zion”, Boris Brasol. As-
sociated actively with him are Professor I. V. Emelianoﬁf,
Rev. Alexander Kukulevski, I. I. Sikorsky and the darling
of American millionaires, Prince Paul ‘Chavchavadze.

Aﬂiliated with the “United Russian National Organiza-
tions in America” are the following White Guard groups:

All Russian National Peasants’ Alliance,’ New York.

Russian War Veterans, New York.

Russian University League of America.

Association of Former Russian Naval Officers in

America.

Society-» for Relief of Russian War Invalids Outside

of Russia.

Russian People’s Centers, Inc.

Russian Alumni Association and Students’ Associa-

tion of America. A

Russian Women’s League of the Republican Party.

Educational Circle of New York, etc.

Mr. Boris Brasol, who pretends to be something of
a literary person, has close contacts with Mr. Clarence
Manning, assistant professor of Slavonic languages at
Columbia University, and other university professors.

It is the “United Russian National Organizations of
America” that has been carrying on, with the cooperation
of Hearst, the -Civic Federation, the Elks, the Daughters

27

 

of the American Revolution, and the’ American Legion,
campaigns against U.S. recognition of Soviet Russia.
Long before Litvinoff arrived in Washington, Boris
Brasol was circulating petitions against recognitio-n. He
enlisted for this purpose the services of Hearst’s hireling,
Isaac Don Levine, the notorious red—baiter, Father Ed-
mund Walsh and Rev. «George A. Simons of \Mineola, L. I.
His main card, however, is Robert Kelley, chief of the
Eastern-European division of the State Department.

Kelley is notoriously anti-Soviet. While still in the
army, Kelley was assigned to the diplomatic service as a
military attache and served on a special mission to coun-
tries bordering -on Soviet territory. His duties, in fact,
were to spy on Russia and even as chief of the State De-
partment’s Eastern European division in pre-recognition
days his job was to conduct a polite espionage service.

Kelley, himself, has never been t-0 Russia. He gets
most of his information from White Guard papers pub-
lished in Paris and the United States. Some of his closest
friends are notorious anti-Soviet; There is no doubt that
both Brasoland Kelley had a hand in the break—down
of the Soviet-American trade relations.‘ "

4. A Fragment of an Empire

There are at least a million White Guards all overthe
world who are plotting to destroy the Soviet Union. In
New York alone there are more than 3,000 of them. Like
heroes of a Dostoyevski novel, they inhabit a. little “em-
pire” around 120th Street and Lenox Avenue. They are
somewhat unhappy and. sad these days. For the Soviet
Union is forging ahead. Every accomplishment of the

Sovietworkers is another nail in their cofﬁn——in the coffin
of _a11 anti-Soviet forces. Naturally, they unceasingly plot
the destruction of the‘_Soviet-Union. »Assisted by. Ameri-
can- millionaires, army men, American Federation of Labor
oﬁicials and even some Socialist Party leaders, they
-sharpen their teeth against the Workers’ Republic. They
hold secret conclaves,.co11ect funds, adherents, arms, pub-
lishnewspapers and journals, ﬁnance sabotage and terror-
ist activities in the U.S.S.R., assassinate Soviet leaders,
plot destruction and murder.

What is more important, however, is that they do all
this with the knowledge and even blessing of the Roose-
velt administration. _

In Mexico, Argentine, United States, Germany, Poland,
Japan, China, Manchuria——all over the world~——the agents
of Vonsiatsky and his like are recruiting the army of the
counter-revolution. They are preparing a bloody war
against the Soviet Union.

Will they succeed in their criminal designs?

That depends primarily upon two important facts:
The strength of the Soviet Union and the international
solidarity of the workers and farmers the world over.

The Soviet Union is growing steadily in strength and
power. The machinations of the White Guards and other
Soviet enemies will not avail against ‘the determination
of the Russian workers and farmers to defend the Social-
ist fatherland, and to continue building a new society

‘without exploiters. Should the imperialists of the world

  WHITEGUARD TERRORISTS IN THE U.S.A.-
C ,By LEON DENNEN

ASECRET organization of Russian White Guards call-
ing itself the “A1l—Russian Fascist Party” operates
in the United States with the knowledge of the U. S.
authorities. . - _ A

The main functions of this tsarist band are;

I. To organize terrorist and sabotage activities in and
outside of the Soviet Union and to assassinate Soviet
leaders. .

2. To carry on anti-Soviet, anti-working class and anti-
Semitic activities in the United States and -other countries,
praticularly those. bordering on the Soviet Union-—

Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Esthonia, Manchuria, etc.

3. To organize armed intervention against the Soviet
Union in cooperation with the General Staffs of Japan
and Germany. - . L

The “All-Russian Fascist Party” was organized in
August, 1933, following a conference of White Guards
held in Thompson, Connecticut. Its program as formu-
lated atthis Thompson conference and as published in
the form of a “military order” in the “Fascist,” central
organ of the “All-Russian, Fascist Party,” printed at 480
Canal. Street, New York City, but circulated from Putnam,
Connecticut, reads as follows:

“Arrange the assassination of Soviet military instruc-
tors, military "cor'respon~dents,\ political commanders, as

Soviet Union, they will be met by the power of an organ-
ized working class, byvthe blows of the Workers’ Red
Army, whose strength has no parallel in the world. But
friends of the Soviet Union, in the U.S. as elsewhere,
must not permit the plotters to carry their schemes to a
bloody conclusion. Certain as the Soviet workers are of
being able to defeat their imperialist ‘enemies, they want no
war with any nation. They do not want “an inch of
foreign soil”, nor conquests of backward states for ex-
ploitation. They want peace to build Socialism in the
Soviet Union. Every true friend of the Soviet workers
and farmers, every honest, intellectual and professional,
every workers’ and farmers’ organization in the U.S., and

in the world, must redouble their efforts, especially at this

time, to counteract the campaign of the Soviet enemies,
to rally to the defense of the Soviet Union.

  

 

well as the most outstanding Communists. . . . Assassinate,
First of all, the Party secretaries. . . . .

“Cause confusion. . . . Sabotage all orders of the red
authorities. . . . Hamper communication of the red power.
. . . Hack down telegraph poles, cut wires, interrupt and
destroy all telephone communications. . . .

Remember ﬁrmly, brother fascists: We have been
wrecking, we still wreck and in the future we shall con-
tinue to wreck !”

The “All-Russian Fascist Party” is a secret organiza-
tion built up along military lines. Its “General Staff”
headquarters are located in Thompson, Connecticut, on the
estate -of Marion B. Ream, the daughter of the late multi-
millionaire textile magnate, Norman B. Ream.

At a time when the United States is supposed to be

on friendly terms with the Soviet Government, this anti— 1

Soviet band of assassins, quite signiﬁcantly, operates in
this country with the knowledge and even consent of the
U. S. authorities. The Dickstein-McCormack Congres-
sional Committee, supposedly investigating fascist activi-
ties in the United States has never even considered it its
duty to disclose to the American public the existence and
activities of this international gang of White Guard cut-
throats operating in the United States.

And yet, the Dickstein-McCormack Committee is quite
aware of the existence of the “All-Russian Fascist Party.”
Indeed, it cannot possibly be ignorant of the fact that the
leader of this Party, Anastasi Vonsiatsky,‘ is the present
husband of Marion Ream; that Vonsiatsky is a natural-
ized citizens of the United States and a lieutenant in the

United States Army Reserve, Chemical Warfare S er?/ice,’

an!"

 

 
 

that he is a licensed holder of a machine gun; that the
little house of ﬁeld stone -adjoining the Ream estate——the
headquarters of the Party‘—-is a specially-built arsenal in
which there are hidden hand grenades, bayonets, helmets
and m-odern army riﬂes; that associated with Vonsiatsky
are three former tsarist officers and that one of them,
Lieutenant Donald Kunle, is chief of the private army of
White: Guards—_<supposedly servants———who live on the
Ream estate under» semi-military discipline.

Besides being engaged in anti-Soviet propaganda, Von-
siatsky is also engaged in anti-Semitic propaganda; one
of his closest collaborators, Boris Brasol, chief of the
“United Russian National Organizations in America,”
with’ the cooperation of the National Civic Federation,
of which Matthew W011 is vice-president, is busily en-
gaged in spreading the fake “Protocols of Zion.” An-
other bird of the same feather, Kolesnikov, who came to
the United States» as a representative of the short—lived
counter-revolutionary Siberian government of Merkulov,
is now working in the Brookings Institute. ,

Is it really possible that the Diekstein—McCormack
Committeeris not aware of these facts?"

Of course not. The existence of the “Al1-Russian Fas-
cist Party” is no secret to anyone, certainly not to the
U. S. authorities. '
_ On December 30, I934, the Sunday Herald of Bridge-
port, Connecticut, carried an interview, with Anastasi
Vonsiatsky in which the reporter, among other things,
observed: ' i * 7

“Although Vonsiatsky claims his organization is not

5

 

 
 

militaristic, a visit to his beautiful estate in Thompson
. . shows many militaristic aspects. ._

“The Herald reporter never saw so many guns in all his
life, except in an armory, as at the Thompson home of the
Russian exile.”,

Moreover, Vonsiatsky was recently visited by an agent
of the United States Department of State, who, as the
“Fuhrer” _of the Russian Fascists in America himself
claims, gave him a clean bill of health as far as his anti-
Soviet and anti-working class activities are concerned.

The reason why the Russian White Guard was given a
“clean bill of health” is quite obvious. Vonsiatsky, as he
stated in his interview with the reporter of the Sunday
Herald, believes his propaganda against the Soviet Union
is helpful to his ‘adopted country; helpful to Wall Street
in its ﬁght against the workers’ government of Russia
as well asagainst the workers and farmers in America.
The Department of State at Washington" and particularly
Robert Kelley, Chief of the Eastern European Division
of the Department of State and “expert” on Russian
affairs, who, as I shall show. later, ‘is chieﬂy responsible
for the break of the_- Soviet-American debt‘ negotiations,
accept him with open arms. A .

The Department of State is not only aware of Von-
siatsky’s anti—Soviet activities but it permits him to slan-
der publicly the United States Ambassador to the Soviet
Union, William C. Bulitt. V. .

In the October-November,» 1934, issue .of; Vonsiatsky’s
sheet, the Fascist, there is printed a picture of “Roose-
velt’s Ambassador- to Russia’? and -the following story:

6.

 

  

“William Bulitt, the U. S‘. Ambassador to Russia, smug-

igles Soviet currency into Soviet Russia.” ..

According to Vonsiatsky, the U. S. Ambassador “is
connected with a chain of money—exchange offices” and
“for a triﬂe he buys in of the countries bordering on the
U.S.S.R. Soviet currency which he smuggles into the
Soviet Union.”

Vonsiatsky accuses William C. Bulitt of engaging in
contraband! Is it true? If not, why does the Depart-
ment of State keep silent about it?

Who Is Vonsiatsky?

In one of the issues of the Fascist there is a picture of
the degenerate executioner of the German workers, Wil-
helm Hermann Goering, with the following caption printed
in bold-face type: “Yes, I killed! . . .”

“Yes, I killed . . .”, more than anything else, reveals
the physiognomy of the “Fuhrer” of the Russian Fascists
in America.

Anastasi Vonsiatsky is a murderer of the Russian
workers and the son of a murderer. To his neighbors in
Putnam, Connecticut, he is known as the “count”. The
truth is, however, that he is the son of Andrey Vonsiatsky,
a colonel of gendarmes under the tsarist regime. The
old tsarist cop, notorious in his day as one of the most
brutal executioners of Russian workers and peasants, was
shot in Warsaw in 1910 by a Polish revolutionist. Now
his worthy son is carrying on in his father’s footsteps.

Since the early days of the Russian Revolution V_onsiat-
sky has been active in ﬁghting against the Russian work-
ers and peasants. In 1917, soon after the Bolsheviks

7

 

ascended to power, he joined Baron von Wrange1’s White
Guard army. The savagery and brutality of Wrangel’s
army during the Russian Civil War is well known. It
nauseated even the British forces then in Russia. But
the White Guard “Fuhrer” has nostalgia for the “good
old days”. He loves to relate, and ‘he does it with much
gusto, how on November 26, in Rostov, together with
other White Guard ofﬁcers, he shot 500 Soviet “war pris-
oners” with machine guns. “Because our group was so
small”, he relates, “we were unable to guard these prison-
ers so we had to shoot them with machine guns. . . .”
Although Vonsiatsky calls the people he executed “war
prisoners”, they were really unarmed Rostov peasants.

Next‘ to the Bolsheviks, Vonsiatsky hates most the
Jews and the Masons.

The designation of this martinet as the white hope of
the White Guards of the world symbolizes, more than any-
thing else, the degeneracy of Russia’s former rulers.

Not that the White Guards have much love for their
“Fuhrer”. He is considered an upstart and is undoubted-
ly the most hated person in the White Guard colony.
Princes, counts and generals who have been cast upon the
scrap heap of history by'the Revolution and who are
n-ow spending their days washing dishes in New York
cafeterias or driving taxis in Paris, resent the rise of this
boastful and fanatical “leader”. He is, however, a neces-
sary man. Behind Vonsiatsky there are the millions of
the aged heiress, Marion Ream, and, what is more im-
portant, her connections with Wall Street bankers.

With Marion Ream’s money———the money that repre-
sents the sweat and blood of American workers——Anastasi

V-onsiatsky is able to support several fascist newspapers
in the United States, Manchuria and other countries, as
well as a gmwing group of henchmen. - .
It is known, for instance—-perhaps the Dickstein-Mc-
Cormack Committee will be interested in knowing it—that
Vonsiatsky supports several newspapers and fascist “cells”
(yat.hc.he1Ikas) in the United ‘States. In charge of the
New York branch (located at 480 Canal Street) is a
certain Alexander Pyshnov. Working in close collabo-
ration with Pyshnov is_the notorious anti-Semite N. P.
Ryb_ak_off, editor of the Russian daily Rossiya. In Seat_t,le
V-on,siat’sky’s henchmen publish two mimeographed sheets,
Razsvet and ‘Put, distributed from 911 Lakeview Boule-
vard and’8o5 32nd Avenue. In charge of the Seattle
branch is.the very mysterious “Brother” No. 293 whose
real name, is Prokopi Vassilyev. The "C'hief” ofﬂithe
