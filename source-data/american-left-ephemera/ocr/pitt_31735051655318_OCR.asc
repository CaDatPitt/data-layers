Central America Mobilization Coalition

Dear Friends,

Opposition to U.S. intervention in Central America has been
increasing dramatically over the past four weeks. Even as the Reagan
administration has stepped up its political and military aid to El
Salvador's brutal dictatorship, bringing us closer to the brink of a
new Vietnam, a decisive majority of the American people have made it
clear that they reject this course - through public opinion polls,
through letters to newspapers and politicians, and, for some, through
participating in anti-war meetings and demonstrations in growing
numbers. Major religious, community and political figures have shown
a greater inclination than ever before to challenge U.S. government
support to the Salvadoran dictatorship.

In the face of the deteriorating position of the dictatorship
itself, it is clear that the Reagan administration has come to a
crossroads - either allow the people of El Salvador to overthrow the
junta, or carry out a major escalation of U.S. involvement. While
clearly favoring the second choice, U.S. policy-makers are hesitating
in the face of the massive anti-war opposition in our own country.
Only by spreading, deepening and mobilizing this opposition can we
effectively limit the options of the policy-makers.

As you can see from the enclosed material, the Central America
Mobilization Coalition has ambitious local plans for the month of
March, culminating in our participation in the national demonstration
in Washington, D.C. on March 27. And after that date we plan to
intensify a broad range of educational and outreach efforts. To
accomplish all of this, we need your help. At this time, it is
especially necessary to stress the need for funds. (If everyone, in
addition to considering the following four proposals, would also
send even $1.00, the cost of this mailing would be met, thousands of
leaflets could be paid for, and additional buses to the Washington
demonstration could be reserved.) There are many things that you
can do to help:

1. Come out and support our events;

2. Buy your bus ticket for the March 27 Demonstration in D.C.
early so that we can reserve enough buses. It takes $150.00
to reserve just one bus;

3. Contribute to our scholarship fund to send someone who can't
afford it to go in your place; and

4. Make a general contribution to CAMC and consider becoming a
member of our Sustainers Fund. Sustainers would pledge $5.00,
$10.00 or more a month. The‘knowledge of our pledged monthly
income would help us greatly in being able to make long range
plans.

In return, we pledge to continue to work to change the tide of

our government's involvement in Central America.

In solidarity,

The Central America Mobilization
Coalition
