CORE DEMANDS T0 BOARD QE EDUCATION —— SEPT. Q, 1963

It is therefore

necessary to provide the most complete education possible to EVERY child.
This cannot be done in segregated schools.

All children suffer when separated from one another.
suffer when important parts of our culture are denied them.

All children
All children

suffer when they are denied the opportunity of sharing life experiences
with one another.

In order immediately to end the evils of segregated schooling, CORE
presents the following demands to the Los Angeles City Board of Education:

1O

Immediate geographical realignment of individual school attendance
boundaries, so as to effect maximum integration of the schools by
Spring Semester of 1964. ”*”“'””'’"w"7

A. The greatest possible integration within each classroom.
B. Transportation of students when necessary to achieve maximum
integration.

C. This plan to affect all levels of the school system (elementary,

junior high, high school and Junior College). The Princeton,
New Jersey plan should be considered for elementary schools.

A directive from the Board initiating a positive orientation program
to facilitate integration. This program should reach the levels

of administration, faculty and students, and could include printed
matter, resource persons, and films.

Assignment of all teachers without regard to the racial or ethnic
background of the teacher, or the racial or ethnic composition of
the school. The Board should make a special effort to attract
fully credentialed and experienced teachers into areas where the
needs and problems are greatest.

Reduction of subjective factors in examination of teaching applicants.

More minority persons in the administrative and supervisory levels
of the school system.

Expansion of the program of compensatory education.

Elimination of the practice in student counselling which encourages
minority students to enter lower income vocations rather than skilled
trades or professions, and a crash program to familiarize school
counselors and psychologists in detail with minority cultures.

7. The Board should make the following curriculum changes:

A. Introduction of Negro and Mexican—Amerh:an history and
cultural origins.

B. Adoption of textbooks and other teaching materials which
accurately represent the multiracia1_and multicultural
composition of our society.

C. Teaching material of equal quality in all schools.

An expanded program to identify potential school dropouts, and
special services to children with this problem.

9. Imediate emergency action: adoption of a temporary student
transfer policy to allow for maximum imediate integration of
the schools, to be effective only until school attendance
boundaries are changed.

10. The Board has the facts relating to the above demands. The
Board has discussed the facts at length. There is no excuse
for further delay.

CORE offers its services to the Board to help interpret and solve the
problems connected with desegregation of the schools, and will, upon request,
meet with the Board.

CORE, The Congress of Racial Equality, is a national organization with
affiliated local groups working to erase the color line through direct, non-
violent action.
