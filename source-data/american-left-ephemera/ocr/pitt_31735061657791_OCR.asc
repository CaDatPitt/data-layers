THE'D!FFERENCES BETWEEN THE DUBOIS CLUB NATiONAL COORDlNATlNG COMMiTTEE AND

when working as parT of a UniTed FronT we fighT for our posiTion

wiThin The uniTed fronT buT we also push for uniTy even aT The expense'

of some of our program. As a socialisT and Therefore an anTi-imperialisT

The peace movemenT is larger Than any group or single view;, Whaf 35

Thanksgiving March on washingTon.g

ll.

There are essenTially Two arguemenTs advanced in favor of The .
DuBois Clubs adopTing a demand for negoTiaTions. (i) This war like any
oTher musT end aT The negoTiaTing Table; and (2) IT is The only realisTic
means of ending The war and a demand around which people can be mobilized.

we alaso agree ThaT iT is more Than likely The VieTnam war end wiTh
discussions, buT ThaT does noT make negoTiaTions a principled demand
anymore Than iT would have been in The Second world War which also
ended wiTh negoTiaTions. There are usually Talks aT The end of wars, bUT
negoTiaTions are noT whaT end wars. The Geneva Accords of I954 did noT
end The VieTnamese resisTance war againsT French colonialism; The baTTle of
Dienbienphu ended The war. ‘

.IT does noT follow ThaT The correcT demand in all cases is for
negoTiaTions. Think abouT iT. Are There noT many siTuaTions in which The
demand for negoTiaTions would be a mosT unformunaTe demand. The arguemenT
ThaT “all wars end in eegoTiaTions“ is-mosT simplisTic and mechanical~-if
noT a rheTorical Trick.

_ WhaT if any one of The LaTinAmerican counTries were To have a
socialisT revoluTion Tomarrow and The U.S. --or any oTher counTry --
were To invade. would we call for negoTiaTions? we would noT.

when lTaly invaded EThopia did a greaT cry go up from The
peoples of The world for negoTiaTions? ' ’ ,

if The war in VieTnam is To end aT all ST will be concluded wiTh
some sorT of negoTiaTions. we do noT hold an/ noTions ThaT The NLF will
push The Americans inTo The sea. (Nor do we believe a superior U.S.
will crush liTTle VieTnam.) whaT is holding up Those discussions is
noT The refusal of The STaTe DeparTmenT To negoTiaTe. IT is raTher

The DeparTmenTs refusal To agree ThaT The Geneva AgreemenTs are The
p . . -7,

  

 

basis upon which The war can end.

IT is True The VieTnamese are.resisTing ”negoTiaTions‘ and are sTanding
in The way of discussions. The Fronfis idea of peace Talks are condiTional.

The U.S. posiTion on peace Talks are also condiTional. Because The FronT‘s
condiTions are jusT and The STaTe DeparTmenTls are noT, we see our Job
as removing The-U.S. condiTions -- The cenTral one of which appears To

be: The conTinued U.S. miliTary presence in VieTnam, The permanenT parTiTion
of The counTry inTo Two zones, and The erasure of The FronT from The pages of
hisTory. T

NegoTiaTions cannoT be a principled demand for iT undercuTs The

principled demands of The VieTnamese paTrioTs for self-deTerminaTi0n free

from foreign inTerTerence, We appreciaTe The Thinking of Those who demand

neqoTiaTions; They wish firsT and foremosT To sT0p The fiqhfinq and deaTh

and To bring peace To VieTnam. vBuT eleven hundred years of peoples‘ wa£§

in VieTnam aqainsT foreiqp dominaTion have TauqhT The VieTnamese ThaT Deece

wiThouT freedom is noT peace. There cannoT be peace in VieTnam wiThouT self-
deTerminaTion.‘ Our major principles musT be, once again, self—deTerminaTion * g
for The VieTnamese pegple and wiThgrgwal pf U.S. miliTary Troops and bases-

As for The argumenT ThaT says, “sure we should geT ouT, buT we musT show g
people a reasonable way To geT ouT”, leT us poinT ouT ThaT people were noT
'§hQwn a reasonable way To go in. We can geT ouT The same way we wenT in: by
plane and by boaT. The way To sTop bombings and TorTure is To simply STOP
bombingﬁaﬁd@TorTure.j%Ehe U.S. could end The way any Time iT wishes by ST0Pl"Q
fighTing and leaving. ThaT seems To us quiTe reasonable. Regarding The P0l“T
ThaT The demand for negoTiaTions is The key To mobilizing large numbers Oi
people hiTherTo unmobilized: we see no evidence ThaT people who haven'T yeT
Taken To sTreeTs will begin To do so because They are now armed WiTh 3 new
demand. As e maTTer of TacT many of our more moderaTe peaceeworkers have
been demanding negoTiaTions for some Time, and iT hasn'T Touched any deep Chord
in The American people. ‘AT leasT, we have seen no evidence ThaT iT has. On
The conTrary, iT seems To us ThaT The demand which can, if anv Can. moblilze
large numbers of people is: “End The war——Brinq The Troopg home”. (i.e.
wiThdrawal). Remember, iT was This slogan upon which Eisenhower durina The
Korean Way received a landslide voTe.

The war in VieTnam is a war of agression. lT is unjusT. ~We believe The
American People are greaTly concerned abouT The jusTice or The injusTice of The
war. We believe people favor The war because They believe iT To be jusT--a
TighT "To save democracy in SouTheasT Asia.“ we believe we musT Talk

-dir9CTlY T0 ThaT qUesTion. Our experience has been ThaT people will lisTen; Think

 

 

and acT when presenTed wiTh The TacTs.

we are aware ThaT There is a fear of nuclear war, an opposiTion To The
drafT and an opposiTion To The use of funds for/The war raTher Than domeSTlC
needs. BUT we have found ThaT people opposing These Things do noT oppose The
war for Those reasons alone. We don'T, and iT is a biT condescending To
Think oThers should. They, like us, supporTed The Allies ddringéThe Second
World War in which all These facTors were presenT.

IT is increasingly evidenT ThaT The demznd for ”negoTiaTions“ in facT
becomes a barrier To discussing The issues of The war. In order To Talk abouT
negoTiaTions one need noT know or be able To explain anyThing abouT The
hiST0FY. FealiTy and consequence of The war.. In iTs mosT perverTed form iT
becomes? '04K-, You Think iT's Commie agression- We won‘T argue abouT ThaT
now. we're all for negoTiaTions, aren'T we?”

We have heard much discussion abou+ "+he working class". Wha+ +he
argumen+ comes down +0 is +ha+ +he Issues of +he war are fine +hings +0
+alk abou+ on a universi+y campus bu+ no+ in +he ghe++0es and fac+ories.
we fhink +his is a basic fallacy and if allowed +0 grow will seriously
handicap +he American lef+ for +he difficul+ decades +0 come. Cold war
rhe+0ric is direc+ed +0 +he masses of people and mus+ be me+. ‘

We recognize +he exis+ence of self-in+eres+. Bu+ i+ was no+ +he in+en+i0n<
of Karl Marx +ha+ +he concep+ should reduce people in our minds +0 au+oma+0ns
in+eres+ed only in bread and bu++er. Ideals and moral ques+i0ns are very
real +0 working people, as evidenced by +he fac+ +ha+ +hey do no+ s+eal wi+h
+he crassness of +he upper classes. ‘— - ‘

Too 0f+en +he self-in+eres+ approach becomes one of +rying +0 hoodwink people:
“We're agains+ +he war because i+ is unjus+, bu+ le+ us organize you because. .
you +hink i+ cos+s +00 much money", People are no+ fools. ’

Wha+ in reali+y seems +0 happen +0 pe0ple——all of us-—is +ha+ i+ becomes
apparen+ +ha+ +he cos+ of +he war is very high in many ways. Bu+ people will
always ask “ls i+ w0r+h i+?" And if +hey decide i+ is, all +he +alk abou+
nego+ia+ions w0n‘+ budge +hem. l+ is our job +0 +alk bo+h abou+ +he cos+ and.
+he injus+ices. ’

The major argumen+s agains+ our demanding nego+ia+ions, aside from

+hose already s+a+ed or inferred are: (I) We should no+ demand neg0+ia+i0ns

of an already neg0+ia+ed agreemen+, bu+ +he implemen+a+ion of +ha+ agreemen+;
(2) Our role as a movemen+ is in par+ +0 make demands upon +he governmen+. We
are no+ dipl0ma+s working ou+ s0lu+ions: (3) To call for neg0+ia+ions undercu+s
+he s+ruggle of +he Vie+namese people and places +he responsibili+y for +he war
0“ Them; (4) To do so is +0 play in+o Johnson's ”uncondi+i0nal discussions“
s+ra+egy; (5) To demand nego+ia+ions implies a big na+ion chauvenism, direc+ly
c0n+rary +0 +he na+i0nal libera+ion movemen+s which we, as a s0cialis+ and
+herefor an+i¥imperialis+ 0rganiza+i0n, suppor+; (6) As a socialis+ organiza-
tionvwéthave a cer+ain in+erna+ional resp0nsibili+y +0 suppor+ +he s+ruggle 2‘
of our socialis+ br0+hers abroad; (7) There is a la+en+ racism +0 +he +hinking
behind such a demand. -

(I) We should demand +he implemen+a+ion of +he Geneva Accords (which give
self-de+ermina+ion, s0vereign+y, and reunifica+ion +0 Vie+nam, wi+h free i

eIec+ions and free of foreign in+erference), no+ +he reneg0+ia+i0ns 0+ +he Accords.

The Freedom M0vemen+ in Alabama demands +he implemen+a+ion of +he Four+een+h
Amendmen+, no+ neg0+ia+ions for i+. The Uni+ed S+a+es has no+ announced +ha+ i+
reserves +he righ+ +0 a++ack Cambodia in 'self-defense , and has in fac+ been
doing so for years. Should we now demand “Hands off Cambodia-~Respec+ +ha+
c0un+ryVs sovereign+y“ or should we demand +0 reneg0+ia+e +he i962 Geneva
Accords on Cambodia? if +he U.S. decides +0 s+ar+ nuclear bombings, should.

our demand be ‘S+op“ or should i+ be +0 renego+ia+e +he i963 Tes+ Ban Trea+y?
Had +he Bay of Pigs invasion no+ been repelled immedia+ely, should our demand
have been “Hands Off Cuba“ or “Neg0+ia+e Cuba's sovereign+y” ?

There is an addi+i0nal problem here, one +ha+ is par+icularly imp0r+an+
for +he Vie+namese. They have +wice had nego+ia+ions, and b0+h +imes +he
agreemen+s were sys+ema+ica|ly sab0+aged and 0es+r0yed by +he Wes+, largely
+he Uni+ed S+a+es. in l945, +he Vie+minh nego+ia+ed a peaceful +ransfer of
power from +he Japanese colonialisfs, and we now know wha+ +he French,
financed mainly by +he U.S. did +0 +ha+ agreemen+. Of course we also kn0w<,
how, from +he 0u+se+, +he U.S. conspired +0 des+roy +he i954 Geneva Agreemen+s.
This is wha+ nego+ia+i0ns mean +0 +he Vie+namese. This is why +heir demand is
for self-de+ermina+ion. This is why we should suppor+ +ha+ demand §irs+ and
foremos+. -9-

 

  

 

g ( ) The DuBois Clubs are parT of a movemenT. We have liTTle power,
Therefore we exerT influence by making demands on Those who do have power. The
power sTrucTure has more Than suTTicienT brains, TalenT, and Technology aT iTs
disposal To puT our demands inTo efTecT. WhaT we are saying is ThaT our prin-
cipled demands should be wiThdrawal, implemenTaTion of The Geneva Accords,
recogniTion of The NLF, and a cessaTion of all agressive acTs. iJohnson has aT
his command The resources To implemenT The demands if he wanTs To. He can
Tigure-ouT “The mosT realisTic way To end The war.“

(3) - By making a demand To which Johnson consTanTly gives lip service
(never mind his cynicism) and one which The VieTnamese refuse on principal To
make, is To allow Those “peace leaders“ who wish To geT away wiTh saying
"we supporT The PresidenT's efforTs To secure a negoTiaTed seTTlemenT,l
Because of The reTusal,To negoTiaTe by The NLF, Hanoi, and Peking, The
major blame for The conTinuaTion of The war resTs wiTh Them.” lT would be
criminal on our parT To aid Those forces in making The major ThrusT againsT The
VieTnamese paTrioTs, and for us To make negoTiaTiOns a princepled demand gives‘
such aid. '

(4) when Johnson began The criminal bombings of The DRV, he did so for« E
Two prime reasons. lT helped give subsTance To his lie ThaT The NLF is being i
run from Hanoi, ThaT The sTruggle in SouTh VieTnam is a war by an independenf
SouTh VieTnamese governmenT againsT an ouTside aggressor. The bombings
creaTed an aTmosphere which gave cover To sending inTo SouTh VieTnam massive
numbers of new U.S. soldiers. This allowed The U.S. and The Saigon regime
To buy Time, since aT ThaT momenT an NLF vicTory was imminenT. ’

_ The second reason for The bombings, quiTe relaTed To The TirsT, W85 T0
sTrenghThen Johnson's hand. The U.S. was abouT To lose The war. The massive
Troop invasion, The B452 raids, eTc., gave Johnson a chance To salvage someThing.

?lT gave him a weapon of blackmail. He would bomb and exTerminaTe The

VieTnamese To The negoTiaTions Table where he would deal wiTh Them on his own
Terms, His “uncondiTional discussions” ploy, as well as being a SOP T0 W0V'd
opinion, creaTed an opening for The VieTnamese To accepT The blackmail.

i0bVious|v This ploy has Tailed. lT is clear The PenTagon boughT only +ime,

 

noT vicTory. BuT The major reason for This failure, aside from The miliTary‘

capaciTy and abiliTy of The VieTnamese, is ThaT The world peace movemenT, l
including The enTire socialisT world, did noT Take up The chanT of negoTiaTions. i
The demands remained “implemenT The Geneva Accords”, “self-deTerminaTion for The A
VieTnamese“, “U.S. wiThdraw from VieTnam . To now call for hegoTiaTions would be

TO play inTo Johnson's sTraTegy, and iT would be To go againsT noT only The

VieTnamese Themselves buT The world peace movemenT from Tokyo To MonTivideo;

from Melbourne To Moscow. < ‘ i

(5) A major moTivaTion for Those who demand negoTiaTions is a wish To STOP
The bloodshed now, wiTh a-greaT fear ThaT American miliTary mighT can demolish
VieTnam. we are Too powerful, The argumenT.goes} we are noT The French; This is
big naTion chauvanism. while moTivaTed by humanism, iT is chauvanism neverTheless
and does noT Take inTo accounT all oT The TacTs of The war.

To say The U.S. is Too powerful an enemy is To do precisely whaf The
PenTagon wishes, i.e. To abandon each naTional liberaTion sTruggle. McNamara and
Taylor are Telling The world ThaT VieTnam is where The U.S. is making iTs sTand.
We will show you, They say, ThaT The U.S. is Too_powerful an adversary. They are
serving noTice on The peoples of LaTin America ThaT They Too face B-52 raids,
napalm, and Marine invasions if They engage in wars of naTional liberaTion. The
VieTnam war is Today The major sTruggle in The world of anTi—imperialisT forces
againsT The major imperialisT power. McNamara and Taylor read correcTly The

significance of The war, and we would be wrong To do oTherwise. ;
—lO— ?

 

 

we granT, as do of course The VieTnamese Themselves, ThaT The UniTed
STaTes will give up The war noT only because of conTinued miliTary deTeaTs buT
also because iT is becoming increasingly isolaTed by world opinion, and
because The American people will Tire of The war as They did of Korea. We are
noT The French. BUT The French did conTrol Hanoi and Haiphong and The Transpor-
TaTion and communicaTions neTworks of all of VieTnam. They had Twice The amounT
of Troops we have now, and all were'proTessional soldiers. IT is also True ThaT
The socialisT world is much more powerful Today Then iT was up To I954. Much more
.of Africe and Asia is poliTically independenT of The WesT Than was The case

Twelve years ago. Cambodia Today is independenT and increasongly hosTile To The
UniTed STaTes. And on and on. The VieTnamese conTrol VieTnam from The l7Th
parallel norTh. Cambodians conTrol Cambodia. And The PaTheT Lao conTrols

mosT of Laos. If The U.S. commiTs Troops To These areas, iT will be Torcing_
Those Troops’ suicide. The NaTional LiberaTion FronT conTinues-To conTrol 80%
of SouTh VieTnam,_and The U.S. has noT gained back one inch of ground, even wiTh
The B-52fs and The Marines.

5 YeT iT is True ThaT The U.S. may conTinue To escalaTe The war. EscalaTion

; will come because of, noT in spiTe of, The TacT ThaT They are losing. The

E demand for negoTiaTions will noT sTop The escalaTion. The Johnson AdminisTraTion
will conTinue To wage The war unTil iT is convinced iT has more To lose Than To
gain in VieTnam. we musT help do The convincing by our opposiTion To This
aggression and by building our movemenT.

As for The possibiliTy of The U.S. using nuclear bombs, we see This as
remoTe, whaT wiTh The predicTed 500,000 To a million American Troops in VieTnam,
The reTaliaTory abiliTy of The socialisT block, and whaT would surely be The
greaTesT ouTpouring of haTred by The world's people Toward any power in hisTory.
This haTred would be direcTed aT The only counTry To use nuclear weapons, and
To have done so each Time $gainsT Asians. We agree ThaT There are some in The.

T governmenT who do noT shrink from The use of nuclear weapons, buT if They
decide To use Them ET will noT be because The American people didn'T demand
negoTiaTions, buT raTher from desperaTion aT losing a war. We surely recognize
This danger, and musT guard againsT iT. we agree on The caTasTrophe of Thermo-
nuclear war, buT The VieTnamese will simple noT give in To nuclear blackmail.
To Them iT is noT a quesTion of vicTor; or deTeaT, buT of life and freedom, or
deaTh and serviTude. IT is incumbenT upon us To supporT ThaT sTruggle, if we

T wish To wear wiTh honor The TiTle “socialisT”. Of course The U.S. cannoT win

A in VieTnam, and of course The U.S. cannoT susTain a war in Asia for any real

lengTh of Time. The VieTnamese have been aT war sTeadily for 25 years, and are
prepared To conTinue for 25 more. So The U.S. much evenTually pull ouT. UnTil
They do There will be no peace in ThaT land. If we are for peace, ThaT should be
our prime demand. '

(6) As socialisTs iT is parT of our inTernaTional responsibiliTy To supporT
wiTh The greaTesT demonsTraTion of solidariTy The socialisT world when under
aTTack by Those who wish To exTerminaTe socialism from The earTh. The enTire
socialisT bloc and socialisTs around The world are uniTed in Their demands of
wiThdrawal and selT—deTerminaTion in solidariTy wiTh The VieTnamese paTrioTs.

IT is aT leasT irresponsible of us To divorce ourselves from ThaT uniTy and ThaT
solidariTy.

(7) From number (5) flows our analysis ThaT a laTenT racism exisTs in The
‘demand of socialisTs Tor negoTiaTions. !T The people of The SovieT Union were
faced wiTh daily B-52 raids, napalming, sysTemaTic TorTure, a quarTer of The
n popu!aTion in concenTraTion camps, eTc., many of The American leTT who now make
2 a demand for negoTiaTions on VieTnam would Then be demanding U.S. Hands Off,
1 U.S wlThdrawal, eTc. NegoTiaTions would noT even be considered as a proper
; demand. - -ll~

As parT of a movemenT concerned wiTh The needs and aspiraTions of The American people,
The W.E.B. DuBois Clubs has launched a naTional campagyiaimed af improving The economic
condifions of American youfh. IT was felf, ThaT as a socialisT youfh organizaTion,

we should be parficularly sensiTive To The insufficiencies of The presenf economic
order, and ThaT we bear a special responsibilify To iniTlaTe a movemenf which would
begin To eliminafe The widespread impoverishmenf exisTing~in our counfry. ’

There should be no illusions abouf The difficulfy of building such a movemenT. ifs
goal'musT be To raise The sfandard of living of millions of deprived Americans, To
Qef more for Those people who Today aren‘T geffing enough. if is our economic sysfem
which prevenTs These-people from affaining a larger share of America's wealTh. This
movemenT musf build a socieTy organized around privafe gain To provide for public
well-being; a well-being which can only be obfained af The expense of privafe privelege.
if millions of Americans are To gain a larger share in The wealfh of This counfry,
Then if will have To be Taken from Those who own boTh The wealTh and The means of
producfion. in a sysfem where The vasf majoriTy of naTuraI and indusfrial resources
are privafely owned, Then if will have To be from This source ThaT a major porTion
of The means of improving The lives of needy Americans musT come.

IT should be clear, however, ThaT any move in This direcfion will meeT wifh The
implacable opposiTion of The mosT powerful and influenfial forces in our socieTy.

The program such a movemenf developes will have To grow ouT of The experiences gained
Through_iTs own sfruggles. Buf if This movemenf is ever To geT off The ground; iT
musT begin somewhere. Whaf is needed Today is an over-all picfure of whaT we are

up againsf, and some concrefe ideas abouT how we can begin To geT underway in The
fighf To build a beffer and more equifable America.

THE AMERlCAN ECONOMY

The prominanf feafure of American economic life is The growing concenTraTion of
economic resources in fewer and fewer hands. UnTil The close of The civil war,
scale corporaTions and monopoly business pracTices were relafively scarce in America.
Since ThaT Time we have wiTnessed The rapid developmenT of monopoly. By World War '
America's indusTry was The mosT highly concenTraTed in The world, and her gianT
C0rPoraTions were second To none. when ThaT period is compared wiTh The presenT, iT
is clear ThaT even af ThaT Time The monopolizaTion of The economy was sTill in 5T5
infancy.

large

The developmenf of monopoly is pnoduced .by a number of condiTions which are inherenT
in our economic sysTem. when a number of businesses are producing goods for a limlTed
markeT, The very survival of a firm depends upon iTs abilify To affracf consumers

 

To ifs producTs and away from Those of iTs compefifors. in general, This is accomplished‘

by cuTTing The operafing cosTs of an enferprise, Thus enabling a firm To charge less
for iTs goods or To spend more in adverTising, and in so doing, gain a larger porTlOn
of The markeT. ’

The primary means by which operafing cosTs are reduced is by cuTTing labor cosTs Through
The infroducfion of new equipmenf. However, The prohibifive cosf of modern "labor
saving” machinery means ThaT only The mosf successful firms can afford To purchase new
planfs. Those who cannof keep pace wiTh The Technical developmenfs in Their field find
if increasingly difficulf To compefe, and are evenfually pushed ouT of The scene.

The logic of business compeTiTion inevifably leads The largesf producers To move inTo

of colored peoples provided The monopolies wifh needed elbow roo. .

However, The world of Empire isﬁﬁying. -The mass desTrucTion wroughf by The

by a greafly expanded sncialisT bloc. One Third of:The world (The Sovief Union,

The ruThiess-eXplolTaTion of The colonial peoples was nearing an and.

America, in confrasf To The ofher capiTalisT counfrlesg emerged from The war more

lBig Buslness_and The Gsvernmenf

The Dosi +wenTy years have wlTnessed a growing union beTween big business and The

.9oyernmenT. This period is commonly described as "The expansion of sTaTe infer-

venTion in The economy". in TacT, TT is The massive inTervenTion of monopoly in
The aTfairs_of The sTaTe. The TargeT of This inTervenTlon is free access by big
business To The vasf financial resources and fiscal influence of The Federal Govern-

'menT. ’The $lO0 billion federal budgeT is rapidly becoming one of The maln5TaY5

of American monopoly caplfalism.

The principle way in which governmenT funds are used To guaranfee high COFPOFBTG
PF0il*s is Through The war economy; LasT year, over $60 billion was spenT on
NaTional Defense and such reiaTed iTems as space research and inTernaTional
affairs. The greaTer parT of ThaT sum was spenT on The producTion of armamenT5
a“d Weapon Svsfems. The largesT TwenTy defense conTracTors received 5?% of all
*he m°“9Y 5PonT on miliTary conTracTs, and The largesf one hundred accounfed for

p3°%- These prime conTracTs were awarded To corporafions drawn predominaTelY fF0m

Was EsTimaTed ThaT l9.i% cf Tofal corporafe proTiTs came from foreign l"V95*me“*5
while l6.7%‘were from arms producfion. ' ’

M““BFY Spending has a number of speciai~advanTsges for big business. .The 90°55
which are produced are noT consumer goods and Therefore do noT enTer inTo The"
markef To compeTe wiTh oTher producTs. Also, because of The supposedly shorT—run
duraTi0n: The governmenf ofTen supplies a major porTion of The capifal Used 7“
consTruCilﬂ9 a pianT. in The case of airplane manufacTurers, when a conTracT is
TerminaTed, These same planTs, bullT aT public expanse, are Then used To produce
commercial alrcraff. Alm:sT all miliTary research is likewise payed for-by The
Sovernmenf; yeT all invenTions are paTenTed by The privaTe companies and are used
exclusively by Them for oTher indusTrlal purposes. Since miliTary goods are
Considered so essenTlal To naTional securlfy, price is no ConsldeF6TlOﬂ in
governmenT purchases. lhe prevamllng prucTlce’ls one of "cosl-plus", which means
-i7—.

  

They”wi|l‘pay whaTever iT cosTs To produce a weapon, plus a guaranTeed raTe of profiT.
This provides many o? The large firms.wiTh The opporTuniTy To parcel ouT subconTracTs
To Their own subsidiary companies. Thus a high raTe of profiT is made aT each sTep in

g The producTive process. »A miliTary economy has The added aTTracTion of maintaining a

favorable poliTical climaTe for The big monopolies. The awesome juggernauT They cre-

‘aTe_makes Their foreign holdings more secure, and The aTmosphere of hysTeria They
gencourage serves To cloud The pressing domesTic problems.

Milifary spending; however, is noT The only way in which governmenT power is used To
sbolsTer‘big business: "Hhge subsidies, governmenT purchasing, and ouTrighT giveaways
are a few oTheﬁ means by which This is donem Shipbuilding, airplane producTion, and
TransporTaTion in general receive large governmenT ouT|ays. Under The preTexT of

j Lef us Tie all This TogeTher.. As a producf of Their_own phenomenal expansion, faced
wifh growing infernafional difficulTies,‘corporaTe power in America has come To rely

on The governmeni To susfain ifs presenf poslfion and permlf ifs furTher‘expansion.
The.massive fiscal power of The federal GovernmenT_provides Them wlfh a means for

drawing on every secfion of The American public To finance Their growing doinafion
over The domesfic econmy, and To improve Their posifion in The inTernafional arena.

To carry This off, The monopolies musf have conirol over The sTaTe‘machinery-—They
musf have polifical payer. Through Their coniroi over The mass media, and wifh The.

‘huge sums They are able To spend on elecfion capaigns, big business has come fo dom-
.inaTe domesfic polifics as never before. Their supporf is decisive To The success of

eifher major parfy. A sifuafion is developing Today where The differences befween

» The Two.parTies are rapidly becoming mere differences in policy befwéen various 590“

fions of The corporafe eiiTe.

The principle way corporaTe influence is exercised is Through The execﬁilvéﬂﬁrﬁnch Of
The governmenf. The pasT'TwenTy years have wiTnessed a conTinual growTh_in bofh The
power and range of funcfions of The execuTive. A huge bureaucrafic apparaiﬂs has

lfemerged-which every day usurps more congressional prerogaTives and which, wiThouT

direcf responsibility To The voiing public, makes more and more of The crucial P°ll‘
Tical and fiscal decisions affeciing The nafion. This impressive sTrucTure, from

The members of The cabineT and The Naiionai SecuriTy Council, Through The F8P7d'V PVO“
liferaTing agencies,-commissions, and sub-commisions, is becoming increaSln9lY Siafied
by men chosen direcTly from The mcsT powerful corporafe circles. ,TheSe me“; Wh0 0"Ce

massive way. They have chosen To do so because Today poliTical POWGF 15 be°°mi”9 a

life or deaTh maffer for_The big monopolies. ,lT is Their direcfvpolifical influence v~
which will defermine whefher or noT The resources of The Federal Governmenf will be used
To benefif Their particular sphere of influence.

One of The mosT significanT ways corporaTe power has expanded ifs hold on The economY»
is Through conTrol over execufive appoinfmenfs To The regulafory commissions. Esies
Kefauver, poinfing To monopoly dominafion of The lnTersTaTe Commerce Commission; Fed“
eral CommunicaTion Commission, Afomic Energy Commission, and a number of ofher 5UCh

bodies, described The_sifuaTion very_clearly:,

"lnsfead of developing policies making The indusfry more responsive_To
‘public needs, They Too ofTen spend Their energies proTecTing fixed in~»
VesTmenTs, freezing obsolefe modes of doing business, excluding new en“
Tranfs from The indusiry, and perpefuafing The exisTence of high cos? _

wiTh unemploymenT as high as iT is, To end arms producTion wiThouT seTTing fouTh an
alTernaTive paTh, would merely inTensify unemploymenT. The privaTe secTor of The

« economy can no longer adequaTely provide for even The mosT basic needs of millions

of Americans. The_fighT To gain poliTicoi power.musT have as iTs goal, The uTiliza«
Tion of.sTaTe resources To benefif ?§0se.who are being pushed ouT of The economy,
shed Those Tens of miilions who suffer uanT wiThin'lT. This movemenT musT find ways
To open up new occupaTional opporTuniTies so ThaT all Americans can gain an adequaTe
living and lead a producTive life. IT musT raise The minimum wage and expand The law
To encompass all-workers. lT musT quaranTee Trade union proTecTion To all and pro~

' vide an expanded medicare and social securiTy program. These are only a few of The
~ r«Tasks of-This movemenT. The money To pay for all This musT come from The real

source of wealTh in This counTry. .Needless To say, The governmenf expendiTures musT
end, and The Tax burden musT be shifTed To The conporaTe gianTs.

WiTh our economic program, The DuBois Clubs have decided To join in The baTTle. We

‘ have chosen To make The war on PoverTy a focal poinT, because, as inadequafe as iT

is, we feel iT represenTs an opening which can_be used To win some immédiafe vic-
Tories. and sTarT The ball rolling. . '

The War on PoverTy is an imporTanT sTarTing poinT, also, because wiTh iT, The ov-
ernmenT proclaims iTs responsibiliTy for The welfare of all Americans. Since we feel
ThaT The_whole direcTion of The movemenT in This counTry will aim aT forcing The
SovernmenT To provide for iTs needy ciTizens, beginning our sTruggle around The war
on poverTy geTs us sTarTed wiTh one fooT in The door. A ' ’

we musT consTanTly bear in mind ThaT The sTruggle To democraTize our poliTical life
exTends way beyond sTudenTs, Negroes, and The poor. The overwhelming majoriiy of
The American peOpie.w0uld benefiT from a governmanT free of monopoly dominaTion. To
build a poliTical movemenT ThaT uniTes_a3i The forces which suffer from The presenT
sTaTe~monopoly arrangemenT musT be our u|TimaTe goal. '

~ln pracTice This will noT be as easy as iT sounds. While These forces share a com—
,mon opposiTion To corporaTe power, They will noT all agree upon how The public re-

sources should be used in The fuTure. IT seems To me ThaT The uniTy of such a move-

menT will be a Temporary and condiTional affair. CerTain issues will bring These

various 5ecTJﬁ"9iTQgvihG”, and oThers will divide Them. The lefT will have To play

5” lmP0F*an+ rvio in ‘His process. While on The one hand iT musT work To creaTe

"Tlme uTilize.ar+as_oT overlapping inTeresT To uniTe wiTh oThers around specific

vicTories. . L A .

Our-organizaTion is conTidenT ThaT even afTer The movemenT we have projecTed here
has been able To win many of iTs objecTives, iT will noT resT saTisfied. The greaT
"”Psurge among oxr nnfions youTh Today is noT purely a reflecTion of growing monopoly
dominaTion over The:r lives and educaTions. Nor is iT simply a revulsion To organ-
ized mass murder and The hypocracy of The ”aTfluenT“ socieTy. While ET is all of
,These,-iT is~sumeThing more. IT is a reacTion To The senseless and sTulTifying

. exisTence imposed upon us by The presenT social order. People are Talking Today abouT

a free and meaningfui life, The sorT of exisTence which, by all reason, should be pos~
sible. Perhaps The youTh were The firsT To sense iT, buT The vision They hold cannoT
help buT spread. Mankind can see in The very concenTraTion of economic power ThaT
i0daY he musT oppose, The possibiliTy of a Truly affluenT and beneficenT socieTy, a
socieTy who h can free man from The bondage of an oppressive economic sysTem, and
which can provide him wiTh The means for realizing his humaniTy. And This will be a

CORRESPONDENCE:

Since The DuBois Club founding cohvenTion in The summer of i964, There has been some
upclariTy as To The disTincT‘idenTiTy'oT'The clubs. This confusion has been m6sT

. . . ‘_

DemocraTic SocieTy;

jAmarked_in undersTanding The differences beTween The DuBois Clubs and STudenTs'?or a

..

ln viewing DBC and SDS perhaps The mosT basic poinT of confusion is found in»a basic
idenTiTy of The Types of youTh drawn To each organizaTion. Generally speaking These
are young people who are jusT now joining The new "radical genraTion”, who seek basic
alTernaTives To our presenT socieTy, and who seek To implemenT Their ideas in programs
which subsTanTial|y combine acTion wiTh Theory and educaTlon. ln shorT These are
Thinking people who Take a flexible, fresh approach To The problems of American life
and The LefT wiThin iT.

. The diTferencesybeTween:SDS and DBC, however, are disTincTive and in The main guiTe

basic. ’DBC was founded ouT of The need‘Tor a non-dogmaTic, flexible, unalligned
socialisT youTh organizaTion. Though many youTh wiThin iT are noT socialisT, The
organizaTional inTegriTy is builT upon socialisT ThoughT and acTion, and These_young

gpeople'parTicipaTe on ThaT basis, ofTen in a sincere desire To beTTer undersTand so-
'cialism, ‘The founding resoluTions upon which The clubs are builT, Though by no means
,perfecT or comprehensive, all have in common a socialisT examinaTion of sociefy and

socia|isT conclusions abouT whaT is needed,

,SDS, on The oTher hand, is noT a socialisT organizaTion. lTs members do include soc-

ialisTs of greaT varieTy, buT organi2aTionally iT has soughT a differenT paTh in The
LefT. The search for a new and differenT way of coping wiTh The illnesses of American
life has broughT SDS To The conclusiop‘ThaT aT leasT cerTain precepTs of The sysTem

‘musT be basically alTered. They phrase This alTeraTion around a whole new Terminology

builT on The Term “Radical”.

I believe ThaT in parT as a reacTion To The erroneous images and acTual errors of The :
LefT of yesTerday, SDS and oThers in The MovemenT have soughT To build a new idenTiTy, T
which in so doing, rejecTs The language of yesTerday as a parT of rejecTing idenTiTy j
wiTh Those images and errors. This is an honesT desire of youTh To have an unfeTTered,

preceding generaTions, and much of The validiTy To be found in wriTings of previous
periods, The ”idenTiTy crisis” has broughT forTh The basically false disTincTion be—
Tween Old and New LefT, as if The “old” and “new” disTincTion was more imporTanT Than
The LefT associaTion which spans and binds generaTions. ‘

A There are, however, oTher differences which exisT. SDS is in The main whaT iT says iT

is, a sTudenT organizaTion. WiTh few excepTions iTs members are sTudenTs and former
sTudenTs. DBC has h diverse membership which includes sTudenTs, buT aims Toward
building a base among working youTh, The unemployed, high school sTudenTs, minoriTy
groups and oTher sTraTa of The young generaTion. ‘Toward ThaT end we are making siza-
ble gains. 'This aim has creaTed many difTiculTies which musT be overcome, problems
of coping wiTh diversiTy wiThin The organizaTion, which musT be solved if The diversi-A
Ty is To be meaningful. we are one of The few youTh groups Today making This aTTempT
wiTh any degree of success and misTakes are bound To occur. Thus, SDS and DBC address
Themselves To overlapping, buT'differenT consTiTuencies wiTh differenT organlzaTional
orienTaTions. ‘ " -

 

 

Q.
s

‘ AnoTher basic difference beTween The Two is found in program. SDS has recenT|y had

Two areas of programaTic emphasis, Their ERAP communiTy projecfs and a peace program
around The war in VieTnam. in The area of peace There is perhaps The greaTesT
parallel beTween us. BoTh SDS and DBC are Today involved in The MovemenT To end The
war in VieTnam. BoTh have, l believe, a consciously anTi-imperialisT program. BuT
even here There are disTincTions To be made, more on approach and perspecTive Than on
immediafe acTiviTy. The DBC seeks To view wars like ThaT in Viefnam in The perspec-
five of The whole sysTem and sees Them noT as isolaTed incidenfs, blunders in foreign
policy, eTc., buT as sympfomafic of The basic failures of The whole sysfem. Our
peace program has boTh a long range and shorT range perspecTive which is developed
ouT of a socialisf undersfanding of The problems of The sysfem and a socialisT pers-
pecTive for change. SDS Too sees These wars noT as isolaTed evenfs, buT has To a
lesser degree organizaTionally developed The perspecTive which gives_a Truly long
range view and which explains The evenTs in more Than general Terms abouT The failure
of The socieTy aT large. Experience and The evenTs Themselves are moving SDS and
-080, as well as The whole MovemenT, To This more basic analysis and perspecTive.

The SDS communiTy acfion projecfs are slowly, iT seems, being de—emphasized. They
have noT, in The main, proven To be successful endeavors for several reasons. FirsT
of all This whole area has jusT recenTly become a concenTraTion poinT of The young
LefT. As such if is basically unexplored and There are few wifh any major experience
from which To avoid errors. SDS has been a pioneer in This field and was bound To
make misTakes which we and oThers are drawing on in building our own programs. BUT
also The Tendency wiThin SDS To seek enTirely new ways of looking aT socieTy has led
Them To inaccuraTe, ofTen arTificia| conclusions which produced erroneous approaches
and Thus ineffecTive programs. This has noT been solely an SDS problem, buT raTher
is one which many e!emenTs in The MovemenT have fallen inTo. Offen The SDS projecfs
were based on peripheral raiher Than basic aims, fighTing around welfare issues ra-
Ther Than basic problems of life in The communify. Also as sTudenTs, The SDS workers
Came T0 many areas as ouTsiders, ofTen believing ThaT They had The answers, when aT
593* They only had a very blurred orienTaTion.

DBC has and will make many of The same errors. IT is subjecT To some of The same
Thinking and like SDS will come To undersTand These errors only Through experience
and sTudy. We do, however, have The benefif of oThers’ misTakes and a special per-
specTive for our programs developed ouT of a socialisT view of Things. Our communiTy
projecTs do noT come To The communiTy from somewhere else, or aT leasf They should
“°T- They aim aT roof problems like unemploymenT raTher Than secondary ones like
garbage collecfion, and They are designed To (aT leasT Theorefically) resulT in The
building of an indigenous DBC in The area wiTh an acTive membership and leadership
which is an inTegra| parT of The communiTy, noT superimposed on iT.

DBC also has a more diversified program of polifical emphasis. in addiTion To commu-
nuTy acTion, peace, and infernal educaTion, we have acTiviTies of a liTerary and
culTural naTure, around civil liberTies, campus reform, eTc.,_designed To give each

chapTer a flexible hand in deTermining iTs own role. SDS does This Too, buT, l believe, i

wiTh less definiTion and emphasis.

The above raTher skeTchy conclusions and generalizaTions are by no means complefe,
adequaTe, or fully explained, and of-course musT be amended To fiT local condiTions.
They are ggi meanT as a broadside criTicism of SDS or a big slap on The back for DBC.
IT is my hope ThaT oThers in SDS and DBC, as well as oTher.elemenTs in The LefT, will
respond To This.

THE STRATEGY OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE

_ There is currenTly a greaT deal of Talk abouT self—deTerminaTion in Yiefnam,
The Dominican Republic, The Congo, and a number of ofher Trouble spoTs. IT is said
principled and correcf demand;ThaT “a people‘s freedom is noT '.g-s-

negoTiable.” V

‘ -..-

Ceriaihlv} iT is True ThaT counTries which are sTruggling for Their indeb€ﬁT

whaT economic and poliTicel sysTems They shall live under. Unless This is.fir§T-.l‘
agreed On. Talk of peace has no meaning. ‘When we in The DuBois clubs speak of» é¢ﬂ,~
peaceful coesixTence we do noT mean an oppressors_peace. We feel ThaT working

To disarm imperialism even while if has iTs armies in SouTheasT Asia, Laiin Ameiica.

« and The resT of The colonial world is, in facf, The besT way we can aid The naTi6ﬁai

liberaTiQn movemenT and assure iT oT success in The long run.

SupporTing The concepT of peaceful coexisTence is Thus in no way in conflicT
wiTh The idea of supporTing colonial indepence sfruggles. BuT, as l undersTand iT.
if is also much more Than Thaf.

_ As long as more Then half The world's populaTion lives in poverTy and hunger
9XPl03Ted by a handful of oppresor nafions, as long as The greaT majoriTy of mankind
labors To produce wmﬂth and affluence for a few, and as long as Two fundamenfally
conTradicTory sysTems conTinue To exisT, anTagonisTic differences will remain. AT
ihe PFGSGHT Time if is wars of nefional liberafion which are The sharpesf conTra-
dicTion of The day.‘ NoT so long ago if was The differences beTween The imperialisfs
Themselves which were cosTing The lives of Tens of millions of people. The drive
for a holy war againsT The sociaiisT world has been The moTivaTing force for much

of wesTern poliTics since l9l7. The respecTive sharpness of These conTradicTions

. will conTinue To shifT and even when all The colonies are freed, The warlike

characfer of imperialism will noT vanish. To iTs dying day iT will go on seeking
To reesTablish ifs rule and commiTTing new acfs of aggression and provocafion.

« . WhaT peaceful coexisTence means, iT seems To me,-is Thaf imperialism musT be-.
prevenTed from using war as a means of resolving any ofThese*differences,iha3 iii.
can be'compelled by Today's peace forces To seTTle all of Them'peacefully; ‘ H
Through negoTiaTions raTher Than on The baTTlefield. Should if be deprive

Similarly, in relaTion To The immediaTe problem of ending The war in VieTnan,i
correcT sTraTegy compels us To puT forward a demand which includes negoTiaTions.

_ IT is clear ThaT The war musf end in self~deTerminaTion for The people of
VieTnam. ThaT is why we call for implemenTaTion of The Geneva Accords which
provide for free elecTions and an end To all foreign inTervenTion. BUT self-

wiTh regard To The war in VieTnam, Though, iT is noT really necessary To
make such a disTincTion. This is one case where The inTeresTs of The American
people clearly correspond wiTh Those of The people of VieTnam. We are boTh _
paying The price of This Terribie war and we boTh sTand To gain by ending iT.

Peace will come To VieTnam oniy as a resulT of a combinaTion of The efforTs
made by The NaTional LiberaTion FronT on The baTTlefields, The pressure which
can be broughT To bear on our counTry inTernaTionally, and The opposiTion To The
war which can be movilized here in The UniTed STaTes. Obviously, The besT favor

_we can do for The people of VieTnam, The socialisT counTries, and The resT of The

world is To find ways To help increase and organize The already widespread
disconTenT wiTh The war ThaT exisTs in This counTry. ‘ *

' LeT me.make iT clear ThaT we are all very proud of The kind of peace
.movemenT which already exisTs in The UniTed STaTes. IT is broader Than anyThing
Wiihin my memory and The high level of consciousness displayed by such a movemeni,
direcTed as iT is no longer aT "boTh camps“ buT aT The policies of our governmeni
33006. is very encouraging. BuT we cannoT resT on our laurels and be saTisfied

.wiTh The movemenT as iT is, for The war sTill goes on. CerTainly none of us

would deny ThaT The peace movemenT in This counTry has iTs problems.

. While new VieTnam CommiTTees spring up every day, The growTh of The anTi-
war movemenT is almosT exclusively a hori}onTal one. Organized labor, Which has
3iWaYS TGTT a sTrong commiTmenT To The principle of negoTiaTions is noTiceabie
by iTs absence, while Tens of Thousands are involved in The campus proTesTS; There
are now six million college and universiTy sTudenTs in This counTry, all of whom
have been affecTed in some way by The campus acTiviTy of The lasT five years.

There are addiTional millions of high school sTudenTs buying “Eve of DesTrucTion,”
“Where Have All The Flowers Gone,” and The "Universal Soldier.” Whiie hUndF9d5
of Thousands have in some way expressed Their opposiTion To The war, There are

‘if we are really serious abouT reaching The masses of The American P9°P'9
on The war in VieTnam, Then boTh The DuBois Clubs and The peace movemenT awe

Where *h9V are, in a language They undersTand. We cerTainly cannoT hope To
educaTe The American people and convince Them of The need To end The war wiTh
slogans They are noT willing To discuss, leT alone accepT. In mosT Americans‘

minds, immediaTe wiThdrawal is synonomous wiTh surrender--and surrender To Them
means a CommunisT Takeover, which They regard as a Terrible Thing..

 

 

On The oTher hand, The American people are in favor of negoTiaTions. Their
democraTic TradiTions, which are a very powerful Thing wiTh The people of This a
counTry, will puT Them on The side of democracy, self-deTerminaTion, and free
elecTions when They are able To und~rsTand The issues. For our organization To ,
Take The posiTion of immediaTe wiThdrawal would mean ThaT we had acTually given ’
up hope of reaching These people, and in TacT, of ending The war in VieTnam. whaT
we would essenTially be saying is_ThaT Those people musT come To us and our slogans,
ThaT we will noT go To Them. WhaT The peace movemenT Then resolves ifself down '
inTo is a fighT beTween us and The.oTher lefT organi2aTions To win Those who are
already acTive, by virTue of having The mosT miliTanT slogans and acTions.

Expose Jonnsow, END THE WAR

The demand which arose sponTaneously earlier in The war, negoTiaTe don'T

The UniTed STaTes in VieTnam,_an aggressor naTion has only Two alTernaTives”

'6Vailable To iT. "One is To begin de-escalaTing The war, limiTing The fighflng.

’make possible real negoTiaTions.

One argumenT which is frequenTly used againsT calling for negoTiaTions is.’

ThaT The Johnson AdminisTraTion is in facT willing To negoTiaTe and Thai 1* 75 A

Such an argumenT assumes a greaT deal which is noT in evidence and which The

laTesT informaTion would, in facT, Tend To conTradicT,

The TruTh is ThaT The Johnson AdminisTraTion has never made a real offer
To negoTiaTe an end To The war. The only “offer” made so far has been one.

increase of U.S. Troops, for a surrender by The NLF and a beTrayal of The naT50U5i

VieTnamese and evenTual reunificaTion of The counTry, The only basis on which The,
war can be ended. ' ' ' A

lT would seem To me ThaT The only way To_expose Johnson's facade of nego-

obviously recognizes is a popular slogan, buT by exposing his “uncondiTional discus-
