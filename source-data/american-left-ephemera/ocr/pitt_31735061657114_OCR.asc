THE PEOPLES CASE
The Story of the IWO

3. IN THE PEOPLE’S CAUSE

“THERE ARE 'rHosE,” declared President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt early in 1936, “who fail to read both the signs of
the times and those of American history. They would try to
refuse the worker any effective power to bargain collectively,
to earn a decent living and to acquire security. It is these
short-sighted ones, not labor, who threaten this country . . .”

Throughout the massive conﬂicts of the turbulent r93o’s,
as the die-hard privileged few whom Roosevelt called the
“short-sighted ones” strove ﬁercely to frustrate the demands
of the nation’s needy many, the members of the Order were
at all times in the forefront of the common people’s ranks.

From the first, through the widespread distribution of
leaﬂets and pamphlets, in messages and delegations to con-
gressmen, and at numerous conferences on a city, state and
national scale, the IWO sought sedulously to achieve des-
perately needed and long overdue legislation providing
social security and unemployment insurance for the Ameri-
can people. At the same time, the Order conducted intensive
campaigns for old age pensions and national health pro-
grams, low-cost housing, public works and adequate edu-
cational facilities.

In the mines and steel mills of Pennsylvania, the auto
plants of Detroit, the farm equipment factories of Chicago,
IWO members——thousands of whom were themselves work-
ers in these industries—zealously fought for the right of labor
to organize and bargain collectively for a living wage. In one
community after another, where powerful corporations were
seeking to smash strikes, IWO branches and lodges rushed
food and funds to the strikers, set up ﬁrst-aid medical sta-
tions and mobilized public protest against company-insti-
gated violence.

“The International Workers Order, stated Grant W.
Oakes, Chairman of the Farm Equipment Organizing Com-
mittee, “is well known in America for its fine low cost in-

surance, sick beneﬁt policies and other fraternal features.
However, it is best known for its ever ready support of labor
in all of its struggles for recognition and better working
conditions.”"‘

Nor were reactionary big businessmen and their political
deputies and propaganda agents oblivious to the aid ren-
dered by the IWO to the American labor movement.

During the late I93o’s, as the inﬂuence of the Order
grew, angry attacks upon it multiplied. Spokesmen for the
National Association of Manufacturers assailed the organi-
zation as “subversive.” The Hearst press depicted the frater-
nal society as part of a “Communist conspiracy.” Labor
spies and fascist agitators testified before the House Com-
mittee on Un-American Activities that IWO ofﬁcials were
functioning under “direct orders from Moscow.”

The members of the Order, however, were not the sort to
be easily intimidated. Continuing to fulﬁll the principles
upon which their organization had been founded, they ex-
posed the enemies of the Order as enemies of all manifesta-
tions of democracy and eager promoters of fascist trends
in the United States.

“And when in December 1941 the country was put to its
most crucial test, the Order members gave vivid proof of
where their own loyalties lay.

The day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the
General Executive Board of the IWO met in a special emer-
gency session. In a statement translated into all the lan-
guages of the national societies and swiftly distributed

'* On April 13, 1937, Philip Murray, then Chairman of the Steel Workers
Organizing Committee, wrote in a letter to the leaders of the IWO: "The
Steel Workers Organizing Committee takes this opportunity to express its
appreciation for the splendid cooperation and support rendered by your
organization to the campaign to organize the steel workers into an industrial
union. . . . We are conﬁdent that you will further . . . cooperate and support
the organizational drives in the other industries where your members are
employed . . . such cooperation of the fraternal organizations is essential

for the future developments of our work."

among Order lodges throughout the country, the Board
pledged: “We unreservedly place our organization, our
labors and our lives at the service of this, our homeland.”

Overnight, all of the human and material resources of the
IWO were mobilized in support of the American war eﬂort.
As one man, the membership was galvanized into the great-
est and most fervent of its many campaigns in behalf of the
nation’s interests. To aid in winning the war became the
central and devoted task of every lodge of the IWO.‘

And when at long last the Second World War ended in
the summer of 1945, the many members of the IWO could
justiﬁably claim to have performed their part in victory and
could look with rightful expectation toward a postwar era
of progress and durable peace in the world.

But for the members of the IWO, as for millions of other
Americans, the postwar era was to be of a very different sort.

4. INQUISITION

“Tm: ATMOSPHERE in Washington today,” wrote Joseph and
Stewart Alsop in their column in the New York Herald-
Tribune on March 17, 1948, “is no longer a postwar at-
mosphere. It is, to put it bluntly, a pre-war atmosphere.”

In the two and a half years that had elapsed since the
death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the war’: end, an
amazing metamorphosis had taken place in the land. Gone
was the concept of close friendly relations among the major
powers in the postwar world. U. S. foreign policy was now
crystallized in the Truman Doctrine, which the Chicago

* Approximately 10,000 members of the IWO. a large percentage of
whom were volunteers, served in e U. S. armed forces. Many were
wounded in action; several hundred died on the battleﬁelds of Europe and
Asia. On the homefrorit, in the nation's factories, mines and mills, IWO
members sought by every possible means to give full rneani to Roosevelt’:
phrase—-Arsenal of Democracy. To stimulate civilian mora e, the Order's
national societies organized nationwide educational tours and distributed,
in many languages, vast quantities of printed material. The Order mem
ship itself bought $30,000,000 worth of war bonds and contributed, in ad-
dition, more than $10,000,000 to American and Allied war relief agencies
and for he rehabilitation of war-torn Europe.

News characterized as “an open invitation to war with
Russia.” Daily, international tension mounted and with it
the dread of an atomic global war.

The domestic policies of the Government had changed no
less drastically than its foreign policies. “The crusading
days of the New Deal are over,” the Wall Street Ioumal
noted. The Taft-Hartley Law, dubbed by trade unionists as
“the slave labor law,” had supplemented New Deal pro-
labor legislation. Investigations of “communism,” denuncia-
tions of “Reds,” witchhunts and purges were rife in every
city and state.

“A pattern of suppression is today evolving at the highest
levels of the Federal Government,” soberly warned it public
statement issued by twenty-two faculty members of the Yale
University Law School. “There are alarming signs that per-
secution for opinion . . . may reach a point never hitherto
attained even in the darkest period of our history.”

Such was the atmosphere in which President Truman
promulgated his Loyalty Order, calling for an investigation
of the loyalty of all Government employes and projecting a
nationwide program of thought control and repression, in
the name of combatting the “Communist menace.”

The Loyalty Order—-which failed to define the meaning
of “loyalty”——stipulated that the U. S. Attorney General
compile a list of “disloyal organizations” in the country.

Among the progressive organizations included on the
initial “subversive” list made public by Attorney General
Tom Clark on December 4, 1947, was the International

Workers Orderf’

" In making his selection, reported the newspaper PM, Attorney General
glark_ “appeared to follow the lead of the House Committee on Un-American

ctivities.

On February 18, 1949, the Order ﬁled a complaint in the United States
District Court against the Attorney General and other government oﬁcials,
requesting an injunction enjoining the Attorney _General from continuing to
designate the Order as a subversive organization and directing him to
remove its name from his list. The Order also_ requested in its complain
that the Executive Order on its face and as applied by the Attorney General
be declared unconstitutional.

    

  

12

The inclusion of the Order on the Attorney General’s list
had swift and far-reaching eﬂects.

Within the immediately ensuing weeks, the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue rescinded the tax exempt status of the
Order’s Relief and Rehabilitation Fund and revoked the
Treasury Department’s previous ruling that the Order itself
was a tax exempt organization. Order members in Govern-
ment employ were hounded by Federal investigators and, in
a number of cases, dismissed from their jobs. Several key
ﬁgures in the Order were arrested for deportation. In various
states, insurance commissions initiated proceedings to revoke
the insurance licenses of the organization. . . .

In May 1950, the chief examiner of the New York State
Insurance Department, Iames B. Haley, submitted to his
superiors a special report on the IWO. For twenty years the
Insurance Department had periodically examined the rec-
ords of the Order without ﬁnding any irregularity what-
soever in them; but now Examiner Haley stated in his report
that the IWO was a “public hazard.” Emphasizing that the
Order was on the Attorney General’s “subversive list,”
Haley recommended the liquidation of the organization._"‘

At closed hearings at the Insurance Department, the disso—
lution of the Order was agreed to be a matter of urgent
necessity. In the words of the Deputy Superintendent who
presided: “The dawn of actual ﬁring is upon us.”

The Superintendent of Insurance, Alfred I. Bohlinger,
immediately submitted to the New York State Supreme

" Shortly before Examiner Haley submitted his ﬁndings characterizing the
Order as a "public hazard,” the 1949 issue of Dunne’: Immance Report, the
largest policyholders insurance service in the world, had rated IWO insurance
as "A plus (Excellent).” According to the Dunne Report, the IWO had "a
margin of safety . . . greatly above average when compared with the ratios
maintained by lar e, long-established life insurance institutions . . . e
conclude that the nternational Workers Order, Inc. of New York is worthy
of ublic conﬁdence and so we recommend it.”

he total assets of the IWO at the time of this Dunne Report exceeded
$6,000,000. The Order had in force insurance amounting to more than
§11b(:3,0e(‘)i0,000 and had paid out up to that time more than $13,000,000
in n ts.

Court a petition for an order “to take possession of the
property and to liquidate the business and dissolve the cor-
porate existence of the International Workers Order, Inc.”
The court granted a temporary injunction freezing the funds
of the Order and prohibiting its transaction of all new
business.
The IWO was instructed to “show cause” in court why
the liquidation order should not be put into effect.

5. THE WAY OF THE LAW

IN THE fear-ridden atmosphere of the postwar years, the
American people had witnessed a number of extraordinary
trials of liberals, labor leaders and left-wingers accused of
plotting to subvert the United States Government. Repeat-
edly, the defendants had been convicted on the testimony
of admitted criminals and paid informers.

None of these trials had graver implications for the nation
than that of the IWO. In the words of a statement issued by
two hundred prominent Americans: “The success of this
prosecution would go far towards destroying democracy.”

Court proceedings commenced on January 29, 1951 in
the State Supreme Court Building in New York City. The
presiding magistrate was Iudge Henry C. Greenberg.

During the first ﬁve weeks of the trial, thirteen witnesses
testified for the prosecution. For the most part, they con-
sisted of a sordid array of labor spies, renegade Communists,
professional informers or persons with police records. These
were some of the prosecution witnesses:

LOUIS F. BUD1=.Nz: the renegade Communist who at a previous depor-
tation hearing had refused, on the grounds that his testimony
might incriminate him, to answer twenty-two questions relating
to the practice of White Slavery and the violation of the Mann Act.

GEORGE E. POWERS: a former IWO ofﬁcer who admitted on the witness
stand that he had previously committed perjury before a Federal

    

  

14
Grand Jury; and who, after recounting in minute detail conversations
that allegedly occurred among IWO leaders twenty years before his
testimony, stated, “I can’t remember what I said yesterday. I wouldn't
say the same on Monday as on Wednesday.”

Iomc LEECH: a former police spy who, after testifying in court pro-
ceedings on the West Coast, had been characterized by Iudge Iames
M. Landis as a “pathological liar” and an “engineer of false
testimony.”

Mxrmnw Cvsrrc: a former labor spy whose police record included
an arrest on the charge of criminally assaulting his own sister-in—law.

Cnanuas BAXTER2 a one—time member of the CIO who had been ex-
pelled from the Furniture Workers Union for allegedly accepting
a bribe.

All of these witnesses gave much the same testimony.
Echoing the lurid propaganda with which the Un-American
Activities Committee had long sought to discredit the IWO,
they charged that the leaders of the Order were “Communist
conspirators” functioning under “directives from Moscow”
and that the organization was dedicated to “the overthrow
of the American Government by force and violence.’’

The New York Special Assistant Attorney General, Paul,
Williams, who was prosecuting the case, granted that as an
insurance institution the IWO was in an unquestionably
sound ﬁnancial condition. But he solemnly advised the judge,
“The possibility is not to be ignored that in the event of war
or threatened war with Russia, the organization would ﬁnd
some means to transfer its assets to that country.”

To emphasize the gravity of the situation, Williams added:
“You know, your Honor, we are at war with Russia!”*

Twenty—one witnesses testified for the defense. Six were

* In addition to charging that the IWO had plotted to overthrow the
U. S. Government, violated the Smith Act and committed “criminal
anarchy" and various other "crimes,” Prosecutor Williams expressed the
opinion that the IWO should be li uidated because of his interpretation of
events in Europe and Asia. Said Wi liams: “The losses of Latvia, Lithuanh,
Esthonia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany, Czecho-

slovalgia. (_Zhina and North Korea are fresh in our minds.,'l‘he precarious
situations in France and Italy are our current concern. . . .’

IWO oﬂicials. The other ﬁfteen were rank-and-ﬁle members
—trade unionists and housewives, Negro and white, native
and foreign-born——who for years had shared in the every-
day activities of the Order.

Citing fact after fact from their own experience, the rank-
and—ﬁle members vividly described the mutual aid and in-
surance beneﬁts of the Order, the warm fraternalism per-
vading the organization and the intimate place it had come
to occupy in their lives.

“Nearly everybody in Rural Ridge, a mining patch in
Pennsylvania, belongs to the IWO,” John Bakich, a ﬁfty-two
year old miner, told the court. “The working man is proud
to have something like the IWO, where he can come without
shame, regardless of how much dues he is paying.*

The IWO oﬂicials who took the witness stand gave a
detailed and carefully documented account of the origin
and history of the Order. Declaring their prerogative as
Americans to maintain as individuals such social and politi-
cal views as they desired, they stressed that from the first
the Order had held to the tenet that it was not only its right
but duty to support pro-labor and democratic trends in the
United States. In so doing, they pointed out, the Order was
acting within the long-established tradition of American
fraternal societies to champion such causes as these societies
deemed of importance to their memberships and to the
general public.“

’ The testimony of the defense witnesses was supplemented by more than
100 afﬁdavits from IWO members, which were presented, to the court
the defense attorneys. Most of these aﬂidavits were provided by the IW

Policyholders Protective Committee, which 25,000 Order members had
already joined.

""' In his History and Operation: of Fnttomal Insurance, Walter Basye
writes: "The fraternal system is a potent factor in develo ing the social life
of the nation. While fraternal societies are non-politica and usually non-
sectarian, they take a lively interest in all matters aﬁecting the home.”

According to the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences: "Hardly any move-
ment or cause conducive to self-help and popular welfare and progim an
be mentioned which has not owed much of its strength and success to the
eforts of the men and women of these (fraternal) societies.”

   

    

 
 

I6 _
It was the conviction of the IWO, testiﬁed Rubin Saltz-
man, one of the Order founders and now General Secretary
of the Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order, that the current issue
most vitally concerning all Americans was the maintenance
of world peace. For this reason, the Order was adamantly
opposed to the rearming of Germany and earnestly advo-
cated the re-establishment of friendly relations with the
Soviet Union. “We believe,” said Saltzman, “that upon the
friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union
depends the peace of the world.”

With stirring eloquence, the IWO president, Rockwell
Kent, summarized the cultural achievements of the Order.
Speaking not only as an artist and writer but also as “a citi-
zen deeply interested in the enrichment of culture in Amer-
ica,” Kent declared:

uld preserve all the different strands of cul-
ture that have come into the making of this country, and make the
culture of America more like a tapestry, woven of brilliant colored
threads, every one of which can be distinguished and keep its own
characteristics. I have a feeling—I feel strongly—that it would make
a richer and more beautiful America if these cultures were kept alive.

A dramatic highlight of the trial came when the defense
attorneys called to the witness stand James B. Haley, the
insurance examiner whose report had precipitated the liqui-
dation proceedings against the Order.

Under insistent questioning, Haley admitted that despite
an extensive study of IWO records he had been unable to
discover the slightest indication of insurance malpractices
or ﬁnancial unsoundness in the organization.

What was his opinion, Haley was asked by defense attor-
ney Raphael Weissman, of the Order’s large liquid assets,
which the prosecution had termed “dangerous”?

“In general,” Haley replied after a moment’s hesitation,
“I think it is a very good thing to have liquid assets.”

“At any rate, you weren’t at all concerned over the fact

Our idea is that we sho

17
that its assets were largely liquid, were you?”

The witness looked uncomfortable. “Not particularly,
no.”

“You were pleased, weren’t you?”

“That would be my general impression with most com-
panies,” Haley larnely replied.

The following interchange occurred when Haley was
being interrogated regarding his recommendation that the
Order be liquidated because it was a “subversive” organiza-
tion:

W1s.IssMAN: Mr. Haley, had you ever any instructions from the oﬁce
or any rules or regulations by which to determine what was
American and what was un-American?

HALEY: No.

Wnssuan: You just used your own--

HALEY: My own judgment.

Wzrssu/nt: Just like you would determine whether or not an in-
vestment in a certain corporation would or would not be sound.
Is that right?

HALEY: Well, there I would have to have some corroboration. . . .
Following the conclusion of the trial on April 13, the

defense attorneys submitted to Judge Greenberg a 195—page

brief summarizing the arguments of the defense. The brief
declared that the Superintendent of Insurance was seeking
the li uidation of the IWO in a eriod of wides read h steria

“ q P P _ _ Y
solely on the grounds that he deems the aﬂiliations and

political beliefs of its officers to be dangerous and undesir-

able.” This action in itself, stated the brief, was patently
illegal, since the Insurance Law contained not a single pro-
vision authorizing any such proceedings by the Insurance

Department on political grounds.

The brief indicated that liquidation of the IWO would
have these drastic consequences for its 162,000 members:

It will be impossible for the Superintendent to carry through any
scheme of reinsurance. The inability to reinsure will wipe out the

life savings and insurance protection of thousands of American ﬁrnilies.
In addition . . . the aged members of the society and those presently

disabled will never be able to obtain new insurance. The Negro
members of the society because of the discriminatory practices of other

companies will lose an invaluable opportunity to obtain non-dis-
criminatory, low—cost insurance. p

But still raver issues, added the brief, were involved in
h g f h'

t e outcome 0 t 18 case:

Not only would liquidation deprive working people of an oppor—
tunity for desperately needed, low-cost insurance. . . . The unprece-
dented action . . . would set a precedent dangerous to the liberties
of all people and would transgress against the most elementary con-
cepts of morality and ordered government which underlie the system
of constitutional democracy.

On A ril 0 there occurred a sensational develo ment in

Since the liquidation proceedings against the Order had
been initiated on the grounds of its inclusion on the Attor-
nltlay Ge(rii_eral’s£li:, tlherednow seemed sound reason to expect
t e voi ing 0 t e iqui ation action.

Such expectation, however, was to prove ill-founded. .

the IWO would be “hazardous to its policyholders, to its
creditors and to the public,” Iudge Greenberg sustained the
right of the Insurance Department to liquidate the insurance
beneﬁt society. Simultaneously the judge granted a stay of
liquidation pending an appeal by the IWO to the higher
courts.""

' In the opening section of his opinion, Judge Greenberg made reference
to the current “emotionally charged clings" concerning any matter
“relating to communism or the Communist Party," and the ‘ special burden
on the court to remove itself from the prejudice of venue.” He then pro-
ceeded, nevertheless, to reiterate the arguments of the prosecution to the
effect that the operations of the IWO were “hazardous" because they were
"Communist-controlled."

In support of this contention, Judge Greenberg accepted the testimony of

In a public statement, the leaders of the IWO denounced

Iudge Greenberg’s decision as “another serious blow at the

elementary rights of the American people and . . . a product
of the current war hysteria.” The statement added:

The International Wlorkers Order, on behalf of its members through-
out the United States, will appeal this decision which threatens to
destroy the great interracial brotherhood they have built. . . . When
we were listed as “subversive” by the Attorney General, we resolved
to take our struggle to the highest courts in the land, if necessary.
The U. 8. Supreme Court vindicated our long struggle. . . . We are
certain that in this case, too, our struggle will be vindicated.’

6. ISSUE AT STAKE

A FEW DAYS after the announcement of Judge Greenberg’s
decision, the author of this pamphlet visited the national
oﬂice of the IWO at 80 Fifth Avenue in New York City.
On each of the ﬂoors occupied by the offices of the
Order, there stood uniformed guards who carefully exam-
ined the brief cases and packages of individuals entering or
leaving the premises. Special agents of the Insurance De-
partment were watching over the work of the oﬂice staff.
A corps of men in shirt sleeves were busily chalking numer-
als on desks, typewriters, ﬁle cases, mimeograph machines
and bookcases. “For purposes of inventory,” one of them
told me.
the State witnesses without commenting upon their credibility or records as

admitted perjurers, professional informers, etc.
Perhaps the most extraordinary "evidence" oﬂered by Judge Greenberg

. of the “hazard” allegedly involved in IWO operations was the fact that

“The IWO has . . . suﬁered a loss of membership due to its inclusion on
the Attorney General’s list of subversive organizations.” The Judge added
that the inclusion of the IWO on this list "whether iustiﬁed or not . . .
illustrates the inherent hazard of mixing politics and insurance," thereby
implying that fraternal beneﬁt societies should relinquish their long-
accepted and traditional right to support progressive legislation and other
social causes.

"' The IWO oﬂicers who issued this statement were Samuel Milgrom,
Executive Secretary; Peter Shipka, Secretary-Treasurer; David Greene,
%.eC..§diD8 Secretary; Rubin Saltzman, Vice-President; and Rockwell Kent,
resi ent.

The State of New York was in the act of conﬁscating the
property of 162,000 Americans.

‘But what I was witnessing represented far more than the
arbitrary seizure of material goods. For in these seemingly
impersonal items of office equipment which were being so
systematically “inventoried,” there were embodied the years
of patient effort of tens of thousands of working people,
their countless proud accomplishments, the splendid broth-
erhood they had built among themselves, the care and pro-
tection they had arduously won for their families. . . .

That day at the IWO oﬂice, I saw for the first time the
text of Judge Greenberg’s decision. It was headed: In the
Matter of the Application of the People of the State of New
York, by Alfred I.‘ Bohlinger, Superintendent of Insurance.

And in those words lies a grim irony. '

For if ever there were a people’s case, it is that of the men
and women who comprise the membership of the Inter-
national Workers Order. _

The willful liquidation of this fraternal beneﬁt society
would-not only gravely undermine the personal security of
its members. As a ﬂagrant violation of the treasured'con-
stitutional right of freedom of association, it would have a
most ominous and far-reaching import. It would establish
a precedent, unique in the history of his land, for the de-
struction by oﬂicial decree of any organization of Americans
whose opinions and principles failed to conform to the ar-
bitrary dictates of municipal, state or federal agencies. No
organization—labor, fraternal, or even religious-—would be
immune to this threat.

It is for this reason that the defense of the International
Workers Order is a matter of most urgent concern, not
merely for its members, but for all Americans concerned
with the maintenance of democracy in their land.

 

HOW TO AID IN THE DEFENSE

There are a number of ways in which to render aid to the
defense of the International Workers Order.

Messages and resolutions urging the withdrawal of the
liquidation order and the termination of the liquidation pro-
ceedings should be sent to Governor Thomas E. Dewey,
Albany, N. Y., and to Alfred E. Bohlinger, Superintendent
of Insurance, Albany, N. Y.

Statements and resolutions of support should be sent to
the I.W.O. ‘Policyholders Protective Committee at 80 East
II Street, New York 3, N. Y.

Individuals and organizations should make every eﬂort
to see that their opinions on the case are expressed in the
local press. S

Financial support should be given to the I.W.O. Policy-
holders Protective Committee, 80 East 11 Street, New York
3, N. Y. ‘

Concerning the author of this pamphlet

A graduate of Dartmouth College and winner of the‘
Crawford-Campbell Literary Fellowship, Albert E. Kah
was editor during 1939-1944 of The Hour, at newsletteril
which achieved wide distinction for its revelations-
concerning Axis espionage, sabotage and propaganda
operations in the Americas. In 1942, in collaboration ‘
with Michael Sayers, Mr. Kahn wrote Sabotage! which
was reprinted in condensation in Reader‘s_ Digest and
became one of the leading bestsellers of the war years.
Together with Michael Sayers, Mr. Kahn wrote two
more bestsellers: The Plot Against the ‘Peace (1945)
and The Great Conspiracy (1946). In addition to reach-
ing a circulation of a quarter of a million copies in the
United States, The Great Conspiracy has been trans-
lated into approximately thirty languages and published
in probably more foreign lands than any other non-
ﬁction book of the last decade. Mr. Kahn’s most recent
book, High Treason: The Plot Against the People, has
already had a circulation of more than 60,000 copies in
America and has been translated into numerous lan-
guages. Mr. Kahn is president of the Jewish Peoples
Fraternal Order of the IWO.

THE PEOPLE’S CASE
The Story of the IWO

By ALBERT E. KAHN

- "Ours is a special approach toward life insurance. We

seek not merely to indemnify against death, but also

to insure life through the maintenance of peace and

to enrich life through security, liberty, happiness."
—From a speech by the artist and

author, Rockwell Kent, President
of the International Workers Order

1. PROSECUTION WITNESS

IT was shortly after ten o'clock on the morning of Septem-
ber 17, 1947. In a large, low-ceilinged room at the U. S.
Department of Immigration Building at 70 Columbus Circle
in New York City, a deportation hearing was being held in
the case of a Roumanian-born labor leader. On the witness
stand was a middle-aged man with a bulging forehead, re-
ceding chin and sagging dark pouches under his restless eyes.
A key Government witness against the labor leader, he was
now being cross-examined by the defense attorney.

The attorney handed the witness a document. “Did you
write that?” the attorney asked.

The witness drew a pair of glasses from the breast pocket
of his coat, ﬁtted them to the bridge of his nose and peered
at the document. The heavy lines in his cheeks seemed sud-
denly to deepen. His hands trembled perceptibly. Haltingly,
in a barely audible /voice, he said, “I refuse to answer.”

“On what grounds?” asked the attorney.

  

2

“On the grounds that my answer might tend to incrimi-
nate me.”

The lawyer handed the witness another document. “Is
this in your handwriting?”

The witness examined the second document. “I refuse to
answer that on the same grounds,” he said.

To the next twenty questions, the witness gave the same
response. Finally, with a sickly smile twisting his features,
the witness murmured, “Really, this is a very small piece of
business that you are engaging in.”

For a moment the lawyer contemplated the witness in
silence. Then suddenly, his voice sharp with accusation, he
demanded, “Is white slavery a small piece of business? Is
violation of the Mann Act a small piece of business?”

The face of the Government witness blanched. He shook
his head slowly, as if with great effort, and said hoarsely,
“No, sir, no . . .”

Such were the circumstances under which I first saw the
renegade Communist and professional informer whose name
was Louis F. Budenz.""

It was three and a half years later that I again saw Budenz
on a witness stand.

On this occasion, the proceedings were before a judge of
the New York State S-upreme Court. Budenz, once more,
was a prosecution witness.

This time, however, Budenz’s testimony was helping
shape the fate not merely of one individual. Incredible as it
seemed, the security and welfare of tens of thousands of
men and women now depended, to a considerable extent,
upon his words.

For when I heard him testify the second time, Budenz
was appearing as a star witness for the State of New York

" Budenz was testifying against _the Roumanian,-American labor leader
John Santo, Director of Organization of the Transport Workers Union.
Santo's defense counsel was the New York attorney, Harry Sacher.

2. IDEALS OF BROTHERHOOD

TI-IE FRATERNAL BENEFIT SOCIETY of the International Work-
ers Order was founded at a national conference of two
hundred delegates during the last days of March 1930. In-
corporated under the insurance law of New York State, the
society had “the purpose of providing insurance beneﬁts
and advancing the mutual protection, health, cultural, edu-
cational and recreational interests and well-being of its mem-
bers.” Basic to its aims was that of making sickness beneﬁts
and life insurance available to workingmen and their fam-
ilies, who could not afford the rates charged by the com-
mercial insurance ﬁrms.

The nation at the time was in the initial throes of the
Great Depression. On the heels of the economic debacle of
October 1929, unemployment had swept like an irrepressible
plague across the land. Despite President Hoover’s frequent
pronouncements that the crisis had ended, the dark tide of
hunger, misery and fear continued to mount on all sides.
Never before had the nation faced such ominous and
anguished days.

Workers themselves, the founders of the Internati.onal
Workers‘ Order were sharply aware that the welfare of
their organization was inseparable from the welfare of the
nation as a whole. Of what advantage, indeed, was the cheap-
est insurance to a jobless worker without funds enough to
feed his children? With homelessness and poverty rampant,
they knew, no workingclass family could hope to find
security. From the outset, therefore, they were determined
their organization would do its utmost to help alleviate the
crisis in the land and to achieve for all Americans a secure
and meaningful way of life.

It was this determination that was to mould the character
and consciousness of the IWO.

Fraternal beneﬁt societies were not new in the United
States. They had, in the words of the Encyclopedia of Social
Sciences, “throughout their long history . . . proved potent
agents in the advance of the working class.” Among foreign-
born workers in particular, seeking economic protection
for their families and the comradeship of fellow-countrymen
in a strange new land, such societies for many years had
performed a vital function. Among the Negro people also
fraternal beneﬁt societies had played an important role in
their struggle for freedom and equality.

But in one respect the IWO represented a major and
unique social experiment.

As envisaged by its founders, the IWO was to be a “multi-
national and interracial organization,” a federation of dif-
ferent national societies, each of which would nourish the
special riches of its own cultural heritage and all of which
would join in the collective endeavor to promote their
mutual welfare. In this form, the IWO would be a microcosm
of the American nation and would manifest the common
ties that bound its many citizens, no matter what their color,
creed or national origin.

“The Order thus hopes,” stated the IWO Constitution,
“to become a stronghold of the unity and progress of man-
kind fostering the ideals of brotherhood.”

Beginning with a membership of some ﬁve thousand
Jewish men and women, most of whom were former mem-
bers of a Jewish fraternal body called the Workmen’s Circle,
the IWO embarked upon a spirited campaign to build
societies among the major national groups in the United
States. Before long, IWO lodges were functioning among
communities of Polish-American miners in Pennsylvania,
Italian-American garment workers in New York City,
Ukrainian-American steel workers in Michigan and Ohio;
and as these lodges multiplied during the early r93o’s, new
national societies took form within the IWO. By 1935 the

s

IWO was a ﬂourishing organization of eight national so-
cieties, with hundreds of lodges functioning throughout the
country, and a total of more than 100,000 members . . .*

And as the Order grew, the artiﬁcial barriers and preju-
dices which had long divided many of its members crumbled
and gave way to a warm new fellowship born of common"
effort and simple every-day association. At multiple aﬂairs
conducted by the national societies of the Order—at concerts
and folk festivals, dramatic performances and pageants,
dances, lectures and sports tournaments-—IWO members
came constantly together, learned of one another’s cultural
heritages, shared happiness and formed close personal ties."

Typical was the experience of Mrs. Florrie Hansen, a

’ The eight national societies of the IWO in existence by 1935 were:
Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order, Garibaldi American Fraternal Society,
Polonia Society, Ukrainian-American Fraternal Union, American-Russian
Fraternal Society, Slovak Workers Society, Hungarian Brotherhood, and
Croatian Benevolent Fraternity. Subsequently, these societies were added:
Cervantes Fraternal Society, Roumanian-American Fraternal Society, Carpa-
thian,-Russian Peoples Society, Finnish-American Mutual Aid Society, Hellenic
American Brotherhood, Czech Workers Society, and Douglass Lincoln Society,
a division of the Order established to encompass lodges in and around Negro
communities.

At its peak, the membership of the IWO numbered 185,000.

"‘ Merely to catalogue the cultural activities of the IWO would require
many pages. An indication of their variety and extensiveness is the cultural
program of a single year in the Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order alone:
18 chorus groups, 25 dance groups, 6 dramatic groups, 65 concerts in
61 cities, 131 showings of ﬁlms, several nationwide lecture tours, publication
and distribution of books of prose and poetry.

In the June 8, 1950, issue of the New York Daily Confarr, the reporter
Dan Gillmor wrote:  . . . the various societies of the Or er keep alive the
folk culture of the Old World. Dance, choral, orchestral and instrumental
groups are to be found throughout the country. . . . Last year, the Ukrainian-
American Fraternal Union sent its dramatic Ukrainian. Cultural Folk Festival
on a successful 10-city tour. . . .” _

Commenting on a prize-winning performance by the American-Russian
Fraternal Society at a National Folk Festival in St. Louis in 1949, the
Port-Ditrpatcb editorialized: ' _ _ _

"The closing group was the American Russian Fraternal Society, 75 musi-
cians, singers and dancers strong. In bright Russian costumes, these Ameri-
can citizens played and sang and danced the folk music of the land of the
steppes and the great rivers. . . . The applause which rang and rang again
showed how successful they were. When their performance was fin_ish_ed,
they led the massed participants in the evening's entertainment in singing
‘The Star Spangled Banner.’ _

"If it could be left to the performers in Russian dress and the audience
which so richly enjoyed them there would be no talk of war between the
U. S. and Russia, now or at any other time."

member of an Irish-American lodge:

For a long period of time we rented headquarters together with
members of an Italian lodge. . . . We worked with them jointly and
had joint cultural and social affairs with them. We got to know
them and to learn something about the history of the Italian-Americans,
about their dances and the way they thought. . . .

In the words of Iumal Ahmad, a Moslem member of a
lodge in Cleveland, Ohio, there was “true fraternalism and
racial equality in this organization.”

“The IWO,” said Peter Shipka, Secretary-Treasurer of the
Order, “has given us the most treasured thing in the world,
unity on the basis of equality and understanding.”

The phenomenal growth of the IWO was not due solely
to the fact that thousands of Americans found in this organi-
zation an embodiment of the ideals of brotherhood and
equality. It was due no less to the practical, much-needed
benefits which Order members derived from an insurance
program whose every feature was painstakingly designed to
meet the special problems of working people.

Policies at rates far below those of commercial insurance
ﬁrms, the absence of any waiting period for the payment of
sick beneﬁts, low-cost medical care for whole families——
these were some of the numerous advantages accompanying
membership in the IWO.

And yet such practical beneﬁts in themselves directly re-
flected the fraternal, humanistic principles underlying the
Order. Miners and other workers engaged in hazardous oc-
cupations were entitled to life and accident insurance at
rates identical to those of all other IWO members. In the
words of a group of IWO policy-holders:

The members of the IWO . . . do not look upon the added risk
as an occupational disadvantage to be compensated by a higher
premium. On the contrary, to IWO members it mean: a chance

to share fraternally in some degree the losses sustained when their
brothers are killed in mine blasts, leaving widows and children

behind; when injuries cripple or occupational diseases disable . . .
the entire membership absorb the greater risk as a concrete expression
of fraternalism . . . and the membership is very conscious and proud
of this practice.

While commercial insurance companies discriminated
against Negro Americans and charged them especially high
rates on the alleged grounds that they were “bad risks,”
IWO insurance plans were not only entirely free of dis-
crimination but every effort was made to gain Negro mem-
bers for the organization and to help win equal rights for
the Negro people as a whole’. . .

“Never any sad or happy occasion happens that the entire
membership does not participate,” said Mrs. Rose Lustig,
a member of the Hungarian National Group Society of the
IWO. “Should there be a wedding or conﬁrmation, or any-
thing of that sort, we always join in one another’ s happiness,
or, God forbid, sorrows.”

At lodge meetings of the IWO, when one member ad-
dressed his fellows as “Brothers and Sisters,” the words
were no mere verbal formality. For the organization that
had come into being, out of the vision of its founders and
the common strivings of the intervening years, was like a
vast family Whose tens of thousands of members in all parts
of the land were linked in the heartfelt resolve to create a
richer life for themselves and their children.

"’ As the only large interracial non-discriminatory fraternal beneﬁt society
in the United States, the IWO—in the words of Edward L. Nelson, Executive
Secretary of the Douglass-Lincoln Society—“shook the very foundation of
the theory that Negroes must be charged more for insurance.” Describing
the traditional treatment of Negroes by commercial insurance ﬁrms, Edward
Nelson stated: "Using the theory of Negroes being ‘bad risks’ commercial
insurance companies proceed to charge them higher rates for insurance.
In their argument to substantiate their ‘bad risk’ claims, they point out
that most Negroes live in substandard houses in slum areas. They fail to
point out that a large percentage of public and private home developments
are owned by commercial insurance companies . . . (and) what lengths
they go to in barring Negroes from these developments. Add to this the
fact that many tenement houses and cold water ﬂats in slum areas are also
owned by insurance companies and the double indemnity collected by
insurance companies becomes obvious."
