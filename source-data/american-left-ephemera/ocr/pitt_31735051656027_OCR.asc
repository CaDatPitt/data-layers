Dear Sister Luczeozko:

It is a pleasure to hear from you again and to know that you are
continuing your energetic work in Lodge 867. I am glad to know that
you are getting the lodge reorganized. Certainly it is impossible to
develop an organization through the activities of only one person. I
hope that in addition to the young sister you.mention in your letter
you will be able to involve man others in the activity of the lodge.

It is m feeling that if you can once get a good group of officers
for the lodge it can grow rapidly in Chester. I hope that this can be
realized now so that the fall campaign can be a successful one for
Lodge 867. Please let me know how things develop.

Fraternally yours,

C

Chester, Penna.

Dear Sister Luczeczko:

may I take the liberty of saying that I am quite

disappointed in your failure to keep your promise of sending
me the names and addresses of your members, so that I might
communicate with them advising them of the lodge'meeting on
Thursday evening. But since you have not done this, it will
be necessary to take vigorous steps to see that the meeting is
a success.

would it be possible for your to get two or three
people to help you personally to visit the members advising
them of the meeting and getting their promises to participate
in it. -

At the meeting which I attended, you mentioned getting
out a leaflet. Has this been done? Just what steps have been
taken up to now to guarantee the success of the meeting?

On receipt of this letter, will you kindly call Walnut
5386 and give us the information required, especially time of
meeting, place of meeting, etc.

If you are not working Thursday, could you arrange to
see me at your home at about 6 P. 3., where we could discuss a
number of points before the meeting takes place.

Hoping this finds you both happy and healthy and deter-
mined to build the English lodge of the I. W. O. in Chester.

Fraternallytyours,
