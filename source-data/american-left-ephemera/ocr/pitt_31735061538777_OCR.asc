IO CONTINUOUS WORKING‘ WEEK

always taking place uninterrupted by the previous too fre-
quent general holidays, therefore in all industries where
ﬁres must continually be kept going, like smelters, Bessemer
furnaces, glass-blowers, etc., the saving in fuel alone will
be enormous. .

INCREASES THE STANDARD OF LIVING

Not only has the continuous working week ‘brought ad-
vantages in the way of increased production, the saving of
material, reduction of unemployment and an increased num-
ber of rest days, it has also brought about various cultural
advantages. The more frequent rest days (four days work,
one day rest) preserves the physical powers of the workers.
This has a great bearing on industrial accidents, reducing
them greatly. This is a great step forward towards a decided
improvement of the general well being of the workers.

Soviet industry in 1929-30 will make about two billion
roubles proﬁt. This enables the workersto receive an in-
crease in wages and raises the standard of living of the
workers. There being no stockholders and no dividends to
pay to speculators and idle rich, the proﬁtsof Soviet in-
dustry are used to better the standard of‘ life for the
workers; part of the proﬁts are put back into- industry to
improve and to expand and develop industry; part is given
to the workers in the form of wage increases and part is
spent on collective cultural work for the workers. Soviet
industry contributes 10% of its proﬁts to a fund for the
improvement of the living conditions of the workers. This
means that with two billion roubles proﬁts in 1929-30, two
hundred million roubles will goto the workers in the form
of funds for the improvement of the-living conditions of
the workers out of the proﬁts of the State industries. By

, a decision of the workers’ organizations this fund is used

for the construction of houses, clubs, the maintenance of
nurseries and various other social activities for the beneﬁt
of the workers and peasants.

CULTURAL ADVANTAGES.

Soviet workers ‘have every opportunity for using and en-
joying to the best advantage their rest days. ‘ Everything is

being done, upon the initiative of the workers and peasants
themselves, through their soviets, to widen their cultural life.
A great deal has been written about this ﬁeld of activity.
All the theatres, cinemas, clubs and educational institutions
have also introduced the new working week in conformity
with the work in the industries. Since the number of people
resting on each day in the week will be considerably more,
‘cultural life and cultural activities will become greatly in-
tensiﬁed. Now all amusement places, theatres, clubs, sport
grounds, etc., will be,able to better accomodate the workers
who are pleasure bound, seeking either entertainment or
education. ,

The demand of the masses on the cultural institutions will
now be greater, but at the same time these institutions will
be better able to provide more and better entertainment and

amusement for visiting workers, since the inﬂux of workers

now will be distributed over every week day, and not con-
centrated on one or two days in the week. It also relieves

V the strain on the employees of these institutions, the players,

musicians, attendants, and others who were usually rushed
to the extreme on ‘week-ends. =A worker. who now desires
to see a certain opera or hear a famous orchestra -will not

have to be turned down because the place is already ﬁlled
totcapacity; or.if he wants to go to a park or bathing ‘resort

with his family he will not ﬁnd conditions so overcrowded
that rest and pleasure is impossible. Instead of having tens
of thousands of workers seeking recreation at the same time,

.at _the same place, with the consequences that only a few
«of them really enjoy or get the desired recreation, because

.of congested transportation, crowded conditions of the beach,
etc. (which is far from hygienic), the introduction of the
continuous working week gives every one a chance td really
enjoy rest days and the opportunities for recreation in every

place, will be better and more extensively utilized.

The large institutions which cater to the needs of the
workers, for example, the unions sick beneﬁt funds, out
patient departments of clinics and hospitals, community din-

'ing rooms, co-operative stores and so forth, also work accord-

ing to the time of the continuous working week. The result is
that shopping crowds are lessened, and so are the queues at

as much business is done, but it is spreadout over the week
and one can now expedite affairs in much less time than
formerly. *

WHAT ABOUT FAMILY.

This phase of the continuous working week seems to
bother the bourgeoisie most of all. “Family life will disap-
pear," they cry in alarm. “Father and mother will have
different rest days and the children cannot be together in
the family bossom any longer. Family life is the corner-
stone of the nation, etc., etc.” a ’

5 But the bourgeoisie forget that the cornerstone of Soviet
; life is not the family. The life of the workers and peasants
in the Soviet Union does not center around the narrow con—
ﬁnes of the family, with its pettyness, but around‘ the col-
; lective activities of the masses in building socialism both
? on the economic and cultural front. Comradeship and aid
to all workers whether they are family members or not,
best of every workers’ abilities is for the collective, for

V; society. The instrument through which this is accomplished

1: is the workers, peasants and soldiers soviets.

li ‘” Great steps ‘have been taken to keep up with the demands
__ l of the workers for institutions which will enable them to
live “collectively.” Community dining rooms, kitchens, corn‘-
ji munity houses, day nurseries, playgrounds, etc., are built
ii in connection with the factories and workshops, but so far
‘it has been impossible to keep up with the requirements of
E! the workers for the establishment of such institutions. This
p fact was taken into consideration when the uninterrupted
_~7 workingiweek went into effect. Although the general "week-
lsj ly' rest day for all workers has been abolished, each worker,
ll if he so wishes, is able to arrange that" his rest day falls
l on thesame day,as other members of his family, or other

_comrades and friends with which he wants to spend-his free
‘time. ' ’

“The change to the

new shift of workers has
been employed.”

The adoption of the 5-day week at the factory ‘Car—‘

lnstead of the usual

monthly output of 30,000 rolls of cardboard, the fac~
tory after the introduction of the ’5-day’ week has been

quantity. At the Ruberoid mill the production increased
from 250 rolls a day to 700 or nearly thrice.

 CONTINUOUS WOKKING WEEK

Wage increases.
The ﬁrst results of the adoption of the ﬁve-day week

at a number of large cement factories in the Ukraine ,
show an increase of production by 25%.-

2o,ooo new workers.

No later than December the ﬁve—day week will. be
introduced in a number of mines in the Donetz Basin.
As a result 20,000 additional workers will get em-
ployment.

The Central Committee of the Miners’ Union re-
quested the Donetz Coal Trust to allocate 5 million
roubles for the constructiotn of communal homes for
the new workers, and 400,000 roubles for setting up
a chain of provision stores for them. The mines which
are working on the 7-hour basis will be the first to adopt
the ﬁve—day week. .

The rational distribution of theworking hours and
rest days leads everywhere to an improvement in the

-. quality of production, an increase in the productivity
of. labor and, consequently, in the wages and the em-
ployment of additional groups of workers in industry?’

All of the above examples conclusively prove that this re-
organization of production on the part of the workers and
peasants of the Soviet Union frees them" of all unproductive
expenditures involved by the anarchistic methods used in
capitalistic countries. V

-Many of the capitalists in America have for example tried
to introduce various schemes (thirteen month calendar, etc.) ,
the Eastman Kodak 'Co., the Montgomery Ward Co., but
under capitalism it is impossible to organize production uni-
formly and systematically, neither can agriculture nor distri--
bution be freed from capitalist anarchy, because of the in-
herent nature of capitalism, which actsvas a fetter on its
production forces, with its competition, its -struggle for
markets and the schemings. of the imperialist powers to
outdo ‘and exterminate each other and the..weakei: powers.
These advantages over capitalist economy ‘do not exist
merely theoretically; they are enormous factors ‘in=t_he devel-

compared with capitalist countries:

Soviet industry has developed about ﬁve times more rapid-.
ly than that of the United States. The speed of industrial
development in the Soviet Union is 27 times greater than
that of England.

CONTINUOUS WORKING WEEK AND RELIGION. ‘

Another result of the adoption of the continuous working
week is the elimination of Sunday as a general holiday there-
by taking away from the remnants of‘ the. Church in the
Soviet Union one of its last footholds. Among the back-
ward strata. of the workers and peasants in the Soviet Union
there are still people who cling to the old religious prejudices.
One should. understand‘ that it is notan easy matter to com-
pletely eliminate from the broad masses of the workers the
age old teachings of institutions that had such control upon
the masses as the Greek Orthodox and Mohammedan
churches. They demanded obedience and complete submis-
siveness and humility which kept the masses in ignorance
and darkness. The campaign against the teachings of any

religion -has been successfully conducted for several years‘

but there still exists remnants of these teachings among the
most isolated and backward masses. But doing away with
Sunday as a general religious “h0ly'-’day will contribute a
great deal to give these remnants a hard blow. \

EFFECT ON RURAL ECONOMYL v
'I‘his~simple ‘idea of the continuous working week has, as
we have seen, been a. remarkable factor in driving forward
industrialization in the Soviet Union. Even the peasant,
although of necessity his time cannot be regulated as can

 

 

:6 CONTINUOUS WORKING WEEK

the factory workers, has been able to carry out to a- much
greater extent the program for the industrialization of the
countryside. The Five Year Plan for the organizingof
Sovchoz (Soviet State Farms) and kolchoz (collective
farms) can only become a reality if the industry of the
Soviet Union keeps pace with the demands of the peasants
for tools and equipment for such large scale farming.

“A TRACTOR EVERY SIX MINUTES”

“A tractor every six minutes” is one of the ways in which
this demand of the peasants will be realized. The new trac-

 

.-'i tractor every six minutes

tor factory now being built near Stalingrad will produce
daily 141 tractors. Forty thousand tractois will be annually
contributed by this factory alone for the socialist reconstruc-
tion work. This means that the workers in this factory will
go ahead of America. The McCormick-Deering V\/orks
produces 110 tractors a day, the workers in Stalingrad will
produce 31 more. .

Lenin said: “One must abolish the difference between city

and country, as well as the difference between manual and '

intellectual labor. This is a task that requires a great deal
of time. In order to make this possible, a great stride for-
ward is essential for the development of the productive for-
ces, for breaking down the resistance of the remnants of
petty production—.—a resistance that often is passive and
therefore tougher and more diﬂicult to break down; a great
st-ride forward is necessary, in order to be able to crush
sluggishness and the inﬂuence of old habits which are linked
together with these remnants.”

This is the road on which the Soviet workers are now
travelling ....... .. and the continuous working week is one in-
strument, forged by the masses, to complete the victory over
the bourgeoisie and to build socialism in the Soviet Union.

CONTINUOS WORKING WEEK
"‘Let us catch up with and surpass the—techn,ical,de:velop-
ment of the leading capitalist countries.” This slogan ex-
presses the purpose and the aim of the workers;a,nd.peasants
of the Soviet Union and the instrument, through which they
hope to realize and fulﬁll-zit,-‘is the Five Year Plan for com-

\plete_._socialization» of industry and the industrialization ‘of
agriculture. . a

At the_tirne that the Five Year Plan was worked out, the
ideaknown as the continuous working week, or the unin-
terrupted working week, had not yet been fully revealed.
This idea was born of the enthusiasm of the masses for the
successful carrying out, as rapidly as possible, of the Five
Year Plan. Together with one other factor, Socialist C om»
petition, both of which steps were introduced by the initiative
of the masses themselves, it has. been possible, not only to

successfully realize the ﬁrst year-of the Five Year Plan, but

to better the ﬁgures set, and to raise the slogan of the com-
pletion of the-tremendous» work outlined in the Five Year
Plan-in four years.

The decree of the 27 of August, 1929, officially introduced’

the uninterrupted working -week to the workers and peasants
of the Soviet Union. This decree is of world historical im-
portance. It signiﬁes one of the most complete changes of
the economic methods taken over from the capitalists. ,

From year to year the feeling of social responsibility
among the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union in-
creases, and the successess which have been obtained - have
made it possible to take this new step forward and introduce
the continuous working week into the factories and oﬂices.
lt is’ being gradually introduced also into all State and other
bureaus in the U.S.Sv.R., Most Soviet institutions are in
some way or other connected or -interdependent upon Soviet
industry. Thereforethe ‘methods of work in these institu-
tions must correspond with the systems and methods of work
used. in industry. Even tho it was conceived out of the
enthusiasm of the masses to push the Five Yea-r Plan of
socialist industrialization and construction ahead as fast as
possible, the continuous working ‘week is by no means a
temporary thing. It representsa decided improvement in

[5]

 

  

  

    

6 CONTINUOUS wonxmc WEEK

comparison with the “working week” of capitalist economy,
and it will remain, and what is more, it will no doubt be
adopted in every country as soon as the working class he-
comes victorious. - '

WHAT IT MEANS.

The continuous working week means that the factories,
mines, mills, and other workshops and oﬂices will continue
operations thruout the whole year without regular stop days.
This does not mean, however, that the workers will work
all the time. As a matter of fact, with the introduction“ of
the continuous working week the number of rest days will be
increased and will be distributed more uniformly thruout
the year.

Already the bulk of factories and workshops that have
begun on the n~on—stop production basis, are working on a.
ﬁve-day week basis. Every worker receives one day rest
after every four days of work. Instead of having 52 Sun-
days and ten religious holidays as under the czar, the workers
in the Soviet Union will now have 72 rest days, plus ﬁve

revolutionary holidays, November 7 and 8; May I and‘2; .

and January 22 (Lenin’s Memorial).‘ On these holidays

work ceases altogether in every workshop and office in the

whole country. On all religious holidays as well as on New
Year’s Day work will be performed as usual. On the revo-
lutionary holidays mentioned above work will be performed
only -at" those workshops where any stoppage is impossible;
In case a weekly» rest day coincides with a revolutionary
holiday, the workers must be granted another rest day within
the followingtwo weeks. '

In this way the worker gets 77ifu1l days- of rest.‘ On top
of this he has hisannual holiday of I 5 days with full’ pay,
for workers who work above ground, and those who work

underground or in hazardous and dangerous‘ industries are

given a month’s holiday with full pay. From this weif see
that the workers_have more free ,days than previously and
they" are "distributed more regularly thruout the year.‘ Now

there areno “h'oly”d‘ays-‘but the common rest—days, for. all

are the ‘ revolutionary ‘holidays. The - regular ' free ‘days'*are
differently distributed for diﬁerent groups, every day of. the

 

.IN THE SOVIET; UNION 

year, there is always a deﬁnite group of workers that have
that as a complete. rest day. .

HOW IT WORKS

All the workers in a factory or workshop are divided into
ﬁve groups. Each group has its rest days pre—determined.
The following table shows how the rest days were arranged

for the ﬁve groups during ‘the month of October, 1929.

a Rest days for each group according to days of ‘the month.

1st Group 1st 6th 11th 16th 21st 26th 31st
2nd Group 2nd 7th 12th » 17th 22nd 27th
3rd Group 3rd 8th I 3th _I8th » 23rd 28th
'4t-h Group 4th 9th 14th 19th .24th 29th
_ 5-th Group - 5th ‘ 10th 15th 20th 25th 30th

.I_n this way each group of workers -gets its rest days in turn
which always fall on a different day of the week, as for

' _ example, let us say that the ﬁrst rest day of‘ the ﬁrst group

comes on Tuesday, the next rest day for this group will"
therefore be on Sunday, then Friday, Wednesday, Monday,
Saturday and so on. — i

 IT WORKS  SPECIAL GROUPS.

Inthe mining industry and other branches of the metal-
lurgical industry a special system of the continuous working

' week was introduced containing slightly different arrange-

ment from other industries. Because of the constant neces-
sity of making repairs all work in the mines stops one day

_ each month.’ Therefore it was ‘decided to adopt asixday

working week in the mines. In these branches the workers
receive one day rest after every ﬁve working days and on

‘top of this, aewhole extra day rest each month, which is a

general holiday for all -the workers in the mines. The miners

'in.this way enjoy just as many free days as workers in in-

dustries that work on "a ﬁve day basis. The workers ‘in the
mining industry are divided into six groups and their rest
daysare arranged as follows: ,

Up to Decem-ber, 1929, more than 250 mines had intro-
duced thecontinuous working weekand -by March. 1930.
it is estimated that all mines in the Soviet Union will be
working on this basis, with the exception of a few mines
where it cannot yet be utilized due to technical or economic

‘reasons, but this applies to but a very few.

It can also be pointed out here that in some other industries
as for example, cotton, the continuous working week cannot
yet be introduced, owing to shortage of‘ raw material, often
imported, because delivery of such material is not yet guar-
anteed. ’ _

Speaking of the continuous working week one should not
forget_ to mention that the seven—hour day 1S now ‘almost
universal in Soviet industries and that the six-hour day

prevails for those who work inthe mines and in ‘dangerous
occupations. - i

A FACTOR IN REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT.

. This new system requires that the machines work un-
interruptedly, six or seven hours a day every day of the year
(with exception of revolutionary holidays. Inporder to be
ableto do this more workers are required to run the ma-
chines. .The_ number of working days for every individual
worker will be less than before, but the numberiof working
days for the beneﬁt of society _as a whole will be increased
f-rom 300 to 360 days per year, and this also means that the
number of workers engaged in industry will be increased.
which is- a big factor i_n reducing unemployment, and for im-
proving the conditions of the working ‘class. This increase in
the output of industry brought, about by employing more
workers during more working days each year in turn in-
creases the wages of the workers- One should _keep»constan,t-
ly, in mind, when speaking of the workers and peasants of the
Soviet Union, that they are the owners of industry, and ‘that
all profits from industry, derived through higher efficiency in

‘IN THE SOVIET»UNION~ . 

labor methods or through the continuous working week or
any other economic improvement beneﬁts the workers, they
being the owners of industry. Increased productivity means
shorter hours, higher wages for all workers in the Soviet
Union. . _
If this continuous working week should be introduced un-
der capitalism it would not benefit the‘ worker. The worker
could not improve his standard of living or obtainthe full
quota of free days under capitalism. On the contrary, the

workers in a capitalist country would be forced to work

uninterruptedly, as for ‘example is. now the case in the steel
rnillswhere the two shifts, twelve-hour day, is in force. The
bosses would employ a smaller number of workers for the
same? machines, others would be discharged and join the
unemployed army and the conditions of the job become
worse, the exploitation intensiﬁed, hours lengthened and wage
cuts introduced. Therefore it should be made clear to every

American worker that under capitalism the continuous work» i

ing week is beneﬁcial only for the bosses and would rob the

workers of free time. Workers in America should be on

guard against “similar” slogans introduced by the capitalists
and ﬁght them. Under capitalism such would only be part
and parcel of capitalist rationalization and speed up.
p . INCREASED PRODUCTION.
The continuous working week makes possible an increase

in production, which in the Soviet Union is to the beneﬁt

of. the working class, but here in America it would beneﬁt
only:the’profiteering capitalist class. In the Soviet Union, for

example in the mining industry, it is estimated an increase

"of 20% will take place under this new system, which means
that the Five Year Plan for mining has the possibility of; be-

.ing fulfilledein four years. ,

Because the machines are working the wh-ole year, and
with .65. days ‘each year added to the work days, the amount
of manufactured goods and other products turned out by
the workers is bound to increase. It is estimated that the
total output of Soviet industry- will“-be increased by 25%-
Thecontinuous working week-._ also will save the Soviet in-

’..-dustries millions of roubles each year because production (is
