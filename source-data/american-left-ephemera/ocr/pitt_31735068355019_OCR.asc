‘DENVER-——Four ‘ Mine-Mill victories within three

weeks last month smashed the long-vaunted and Well-fi-
nanced assault by the raiding AFL-CIO Steelworkers on
this union’s ‘non-ferrous metals jurisdiction. The all—out
Steel raiding campaign, launched many months ago with
vain boasts of a mass take-over this year, was shattered
on the hard rock of Mine-Mill rank and file resistance.

The concentrated attack was defeated by the work-
ers’ Votes in NLRB elections at the AS&R refinery in
Baltimore, Md., the Anaconda Company smelter in Great
Falls, Mont., the Magma Copper Company mine, mill and
smelter in San Manuel, Ariz., and the Anaconda-Ameri-

can Brass Company plant in

F IWASHINGTON, D. C.—-Mine-Mill last month scored another impressive breakthrough in its national legislative
:,:efforts to ‘advance the welfare of its members and all other Workers in similarly hazardous industries. The break-
‘ ' otion in Cohgress of legislation based specifically on the union’s proposal

 

 

are

etire

; It came less than two weeks after the International convention in Toronto adopted a major resolution calling
- for enactment -of a. -bill to permit optional retirement at age 60 with full Social Security benefits for miners and
 workers in other occupations dangerous to health and safety. If passed, the law would enable workers on such jobs
’ . to retire, if they wish, five years earlier but on the same basis as the Social Security Act now provides for workers
, _ retiringfat age 65.
 Convention action on the

bill was followed immediately with a flight into Washington by Mine-Mill Research

Director Arthur W. Stuart
to push the union’s pro-
posal" on Capitol Hill. The legis-
lation was promptly introduced
in the House of Representatives
by Congressmen Joseph M.
Montoya (D., N.M.) and David
S..King (D., Utah) under the
titles H. R. 11155 and H. R.
11156. It has been referred to
the House Ways and Means
Committee. , -

A key argument in Stuart’s
successful lobby work to get the
bill into the congressional hop-
per was the fact, stressed in the
Mine-Mill convention resolution,
that early retirement provisions
are now part of the welfare
laws of more than a score of
advanced industrial nations. He
also noted that such legislation
has been endorsed by the Inter-
national Labor Office. “

Mine-Mill Fights Halt
In Mine Safety Survey

DENVER—Members of Mine-Mill were aroused last
month by the sudden interruption of the Bureau of Mines
survey of mine safety which got under way at the start
of the year. The survey was authorized by the bill Mine-
Mill fought to have passed by the last session of Con.gress.

Arrangements had been
worked out by Mine-Mill to
cooperate in the- survey by hav-
ing local unions consult with
federal inspectors during the
course of investigations. Reports
of fatal and disabling accidents
were being funneled into Denver
from mining locals and immedi-
ately passed on to the Bureau.

The program was rolling
smoothly_ and Mine-Mi1l’s coop-
eration in these and other ways
was proving very effective. The
Bureau was very helpful, for
example, in providing Mine-Mill
leaders in Arizona with advice
on a serious health problem
that had developed at the San
Manuel Mine (Local 937) with
the use of ammonium nitrate
blasting agents.

>1‘ Il< 5?

THEN a Bureau inspector in-
vestigating the fatal accident on
April 8 of Brother Ben Sanchez
of Local 124, Ruth, Nevada, was
pulled off the job in the middle
of the investigation on orders
from Washington.

On April 24, the Mine-Mill In-
ternational office was informed
of the fatal accident that day of
Brother Pilar Contreras of Local
616 at the Phelps Dodge open
pit, Morenci, Arizona. The Bu-
reau of Mines office was_ im-
mediately . called, and Mine-Mill
was informed that on orders
from Washington the Bureau
would be unable to investigate
this accident, as had been the
standard practice previously.

Subsequently, it was learned
that the Bureau, on orders from
higher up, had called off all
mine safety inspections sched-
uled under the survey.

NO explanation for this sud-
den interruption of a program
so vital to the lives and health of
the union’s members and all
other workers in ferrous, non-
ferrous or non-metallic mines
was offered, either by the Bu-
reau’s western headquarters in
Denver, or by the Department
of Interior in Washington.

President John Clark swung
into action immediately, calling
key congressional figures by
telephone, and sending tele-
grams of protest and requests
for explanation to Secretary of
Interior Stewart Udall and to a
large number of Senators and
Congressmen. He called for a
congressional investigation of
this scandalous situation. Key
Mine-Mill locals in the West
were alerted, and got in im-
mediate touch with their Sen-
ators ’and Congressmen.

President Thomas Kennedy of’

the United Mine Workers also
took vigourous a ction upon
learning the facts from Clark.
In a telegram to Secretary Udall
he protested the interruption of

the survey and said, “We have
every confidence in the ability
of the Bureau of Mines to con-
scientiously conduct this sur-
Vey.”
=l= =l¢ ‘ls

SECRETARY of Interior Udall
delayed until April 26 acknowl-
edgement of President Clark’s
telegrams, the first of which
had been sent on April 18.

Udall advised Clark briefly
that investigations of mine fa-
talities were being resumed un-
der the mine safety survey, but
did not say that the numerous
mine safety surveys that had
been planned were being re-
sumed.

Secretary Udall’s action Aun-
doubtedly was in response to
the storm of protest which was
aroused by the interruption of
fatality investigations.

:,k :3: 31¢

MINE-MILL has stressed the
importance of maintaining the
integrity of the Bureau of
Mines, and strict adherence to
the- law calling for the mine
safety survey. While the full
story behind these developments
has not yet come out, it is
apparent that influences outside
the Bureau of Mines have been
responsible for the interruption
of its activities.

Mine-Mill will continue to push
with all of its resources for
resumption of the mine safety

. survey and an end to meddling,

from whatever quarter, in the
conduct of this program by the
only agency with the resources
and the know-how to do the job.

Assurances received to date
from Congressmen and Senators
encourage the union to believe
this disruption will soon come
to an end.

Damon Marshall

Dies in Baltimore

BALTIMORE, Md. — Damon
Marshall, Warden of Mine-Mill
Local 625 at the AS&R plant
here, died April 8 at the age of
56, apparently from a heart at-
tack while asleep at home.

One of ..the local’s most out-
standing members for the past
20 years, Marshall passed away
just two days after he helped
defeat a Steel raid against his
union. On the night of the NLRB
election he had waited at the
plant gate to be one of the first
to learn of the Mine-Mill victory,
then came by the Union Hall to
express his joy at the results.

Funeral services were held
April 12 at Payne A.M.E. Church
where union brothers came ‘to
mourn his untimely death.

Greater local political action
work than ever was urged

important task this
year” to afford voters “a real
choice” in the primary and gen-

ON THE INDUSTRY, the
convention adopted a major
resolution calling for legisla-
tion to provide optional retire-
ment at age 60 with full bene-
fits for miners and workers in
other hazardous industries.

Quick follow-up action on
this proposal came immediately
after the convention with intro-
duction in Congress of a Mine-

‘Mill bill by Congressmen Mon-

toya of New Mexico and King
of Utah. (See separate story on
Page 1.)

Another resolution urged the
fullest cooperation of all min-

ing area locals with the Bureau

of Mines which had already be- ‘

gun an extensive investigation
of safety conditions under the
Metallic and Non-metallic
Mines Study Act of 1961. Pas-
sage of the Act, the statement
pointed out, was a direct re-

. sult of the nation-wide lobby-

ing campaign instituted by
Mine-Mill last year to lay the
basis for enactment of a federal
mine safety inspection and en-
forcement law covering the
non-ferrous metals industry.
Also incorporated in the leg-
islative proposals for the in-
dustry was a re-endorsement
of the ,union’s metals program

lems in copper, lead and zinc.

as hard bargaining is indicated,
when the entire Council will be

The company has been made
aware that any settlement pack-
age must add up to no less in
total value of wages and fringe
benefits than the other major
producers have already settled

or.

On this basis, areas of bar-
gaining included in the Kenne-
cott Council proposals cover the
issues of wages, shift differen-
tials, health and welfare, pen-
sions, severance pay, vacations
and holidays, accrued benefits,
job evaluation, service require-
ments and supplemental work-
men’s compensation benefits.

convention session in Toronto
representing Anaconda - Ameri-

Utah, Connecticut and New

liminary discussion of wage

and fringe benefit proposals,-

the delegates raised the de-
mand for national negotiations
as part of the Council’s bargain-
ing agenda.

Later, on April 10, members
of the Montana Mine-Mill Joint
Negotiating Committee f r o m
Butte, Anaconda, Great Falls
and East Helena held a pre-
liminary meeting in Anaconda
to map a proposed bargaining
program. Here, too, demands

for opening negotiations includ-

ed wages, shift differentials,
pension improvements and
vesting, health and welfare, va-

cations, supplemental work-
men's compensation benefits
and job security.

A further meeting was planned
to discuss local issues and pre-
pare the final draft of pro-
posals for submission to the
company.

AT the big U. S. Metals cop-
per refinery in Carteret, N. J .,
Mine-Mill Local 837 had start-
ed a series of departmental
meetings to draw up bargaining
proposals. An election of its ne-
gotiating committee was sched-
uled for April 30. Talks with
the company were expected to
begin about the middle of May.

In addition to a package
based on the Mine-Mill industry
pattern, a chief‘ issue of the
local is sure to be the job se-
curity demand for guarantees
on cross-classifications.

Smith Staysii
Labor Unity
Main Need

TORONTO, Ont.——An appeal
for unity in the trade union
movement was made here by
Mine - Mill Canadian National
President Ken Smith in his of-
ficers’ report to the 57th con-
vention. He projected labor uni-
ty as the only solution to the
complex problems now confront-
ing Canadian workers. ’

Such problems as continuing
high unemployment, economic
insecurity for both the employed
and the jobless, and the un-
healthy state of the Canadian
economy could not be taken care
of under existing arrangements,
Smith stated.

Concrete measures—such as a
moratorium on installment pay-
ments for unemployed workers
as well as higher unemployed
benefits—-require a fighting ap-
proach by all labor in order to
be realized, the Canadian leader
said.

95 1: S:

UNFORTUNATELY, he add-
ed, this is certainly not the ap-
proach which characterizes the
present state of affairs in the
Canadian labor movement.

He charged that the official
leaders of the Canadian Labor
Congress, dominated by the
Steelworkers, are wasting ener-
gy and members’ dues money
by condoning a fratricidal policy
of raiding instead of projecting
a campaign of uniting the labor
movement in its own interests.

‘Raiding, Urges  
{Unity of Labor P

’ TORONTO, Ont.——Raiding and
the use of anti-labor laws by
raiding unions “to split, divide
and weaken all organized work-
ing people” were condemned by
Mine-Mi1l’s‘ 57th convention.

The convention went‘ on rec-
ord against the use of provi-
sions of the Taft-Hartley, Mc-
Carran, “Right-to-Work,” Land-
rum-Griffin “and all other anti-
labor laws.by any tradeunion
to raid; undermine or otherwise
attack another -trade union.” It
‘called on the AFL-CIO and Ca-
nadian Labor Congress “to put
an .end to raids, disruption, ex-
pulsions and suicide in the trade
-union movement of both coun-
-tries.”

The resolution, called on these
parent federations to -“recognize
-that reuniting the entire‘ labor
movement in Canada and the
United States is. essential to
preservation of the entire trade
union movement in both coun-
"tries against ‘the .well-organized
anti-union crusade now under
fwany by the forces of reaction.”

the closing session of the
at New Delhi in 1961, de0
clared:

“War itself is our com-
mon enemy, for war is an of-
fense to the ‘nature of man.
Therefore, let peace with jus-
tice. be seen as the paramount
interest of every nation. To halt

the race in arms, and to replace
the balance of terror with co-
operative world order is imper-
'ative. Complete and general
‘disarmament is the accepted
goal and concrete stepysl must
«be taken to reach it.” .
This statement, the Mine-Mill
resolution said, “voices the uni-
‘versal concern of all mankind
over our common survival.” '

=1<=l< 9':

THE resolution also said: ,

“Increasing sections of the la-
bor movement hold with us that
‘every possible avenue to total
‘disarmament must be explored
"with good will and understand-
ing. We are but a small part
of a mighty host all over the
world, of men and women,

of life, which must eventually

Action on Rights;  
 Liberties Stressed

TORONTO, Ont.——Enforcement of basic rights for

 

‘minority groups was stressed in a series of resolutions
-vadopted by the Mine - Mill convention dealing with

civil rights and civil liberties. The convention called for a
redoubling of efforts “in all phases of the civil rights

 struggle being waged
 - throughout the length and

-q ,,breadth of the land.’.’

To put declared principle into

i t «practice, a resolution was ap-

 . proved urging President Ken-

“ nedy to appoint a qualified

Negro lawyer or judge to the

vacancy left'.on._the U. S. Su-

. pr'e1ne'.Court by the resignation

“‘ -of, Justice Whittaker. Specifical-

ly proposed for the Supreme

Court was Judge William Hastie

of the Court of Appeals for the

‘ The resolution said the va-

Wcancy provided President Ken-

nedy with “a historic opportu-

nity to give recognition to the

struggle of the Negro people for

equal opportunity.”

' ' STRENGTHENING of efforts

_ “to bring‘ full job rights to all

 . minority groups, including elim-

‘ - ination of discrimination in hir-

ing, upgrading and wage rates”

was urged in another resolution

which said the fight “for equal

‘job opportunity and economic

equality remains -the primary

5 responsibility of the American
trade union movement.”

It .called on the Kennedy Ad-
;_ininistration for action on meas-
ures “to realize the full scope

, DENVER — Practical applica-
 of» the 57th. Convention’s civil
rights resolution to a current
’ 7batt1e,in‘Congress was under-
. scored last month by the Mine-
r -"-. ~-Mill International office in an
' urgent memorandum to all local
- "unions. ‘ ‘
The communication called at-
tention to Senate Bill 2750 which
"provides that a sixth-grade edu-
; cation_be_accepted as proof of
literacy by registrars in deter-
. mining elegibility to vote in
federal elections. The bill_ has
- been under debate on the Senate

‘V. their Senators immediately urg-
” ’ ing they support its passage.
The civil rights measure is
‘ sponsored by the Administration
with Senate Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield leading the floor
fight for a vote on its behalf.

     

 

  

"\i inate a variety of State literacy
" - «tests used to disqualify Negro

 “Although the bill will in no

_sense secure the right of our

.Neg_ro citizens to vote, it- is a
._,,~- T significant step in the right di-

.”‘“1'ection,” the Mine-Mill officers’
’ ‘memorandum pointed out.

 

‘ Purpose of the bill is to elim- ,

Democratic Party platforms of
1960.”

Needed, the resolution said, is
legislation to implement the Su-
preme Court decision on
schools, establish the Attorney
General’s right to institute
civil and political rights suits,
eliminate poll taxes and other
voting restrictions and set up
an effective FEPC.

While crediting Kennedy with
significant advances, the state-
ment added “this is a long way
from what is still needed.” The
President should “assert the
moral and legal authority of
his office to end segregation in
our c o u n t r y,” the resolution
said. i

It also called for broadening
the work of the union’s Nation-
al Civil Rights Committee to in-
clude the field of civil liberties
and to change its name to .“In-
ternational Human Rights Com-
mittee”.

:1<=Z<>I<

“RIGHT-TO-WORK” laws
were hit in another resolution
calling for ‘repeal of such legis-
lation or any other laws de-
signed to outlaw union security.

The Landrum-Griffin Act and
other so-called “labor reform”
laws were attacked as restric-
tive and “interfering with the
rights of unions and union mem-
bers to bargain effectively.”
This resolution declared the
union’s stand “for unity with all
labor for repeal of all restric-
tive labor legislation, including
repressive acts such as Taft-
Hartley, Walter-McCarran,
Smith and Brownell-Butler laws.

The convention also urged
abolition of the House Un-Amer-
ican Activities Committee as an
instrument of attack on and
suppression of free thought and
free expression, _ ,. . . .-

 2? tit

ALSO in line with the fight
for civil liberties, particularly
as it affects the labor move-
ment, ' the delegates went on
record reaffirming the union’s
stand “100 percent in every
way” for defense of the seven
defendants in the Taft-Hartley
conspiracy case, “including fi-
nancial backing needed to se-
cure. their complete acquittal.”

Another resolution denounced
the SACB proceedings against
Mine-Mill and the McCarran
Act under which the proceed-
ings were initiated as extensions
of McCarthy-era attacks on free
speech, press, assembly and

the democratic rights of labor '

unions to function in a free so-
ciety. .
It expressed every confidence

that the union would be vindi-
cated in this case, just as it has

national convention in Tucson a
year ago and subsequently was
drafted in bill form by the
union’s Research Department,
then approved by the Executive
Board. It was the Mine-Mill draft

which was introduced last.month
after editorial review by the
House of Representatives draft-
ing section.

The legislation is in the form
of an amendment to the Social
Security Act. Under congres-
sional rules, it must first be
passed by the House before be-
ing considered by the Senate.

: as v;

THE bill calls for investiga-
tions for the purpose of designat-
ing hazardous occupations. It
specifies that weight shall be

given in these proceedings to
such factors as fatal and dis-
abling accident rates, occupa-

tional mortality, incidence of dis- '

abling occupational diseases and
physical ability of older workers
to perform duties involved.

As law, it would authorize re-
tirement at age 60 with full
benefits for anyone who desired
to do so and who had put in 10

ern California.

Altogether, the adopted reso-
lution pointed out, such a struc-

ture would more accuratelyre-.

fleet the major organizational
concentrations of the union,
adapt to the proportional shifts
in membership of the various
districts, and tighten up the or-
ganization to provide for better
servicing, a more concentrated
organizing program and more

effective educational and legis-

lative activity.

Linked with this proposition
was the proposal approved for
referendum to raise U. S. per-
capita and set minimum local
clues as a means of placing
both the International and local
unions on a more sound finan-
cial footing.

5.: is 5!;

THE p r o p o s e d amendment
would raise the International
percapita levy by 75 cents from
the present $1.75 to $2.50 per
month, 25 cents of which would
be deposited in the Internation-
al Union Strike Fund. It would
also establish minimum local
union dues of $5 per month, set
a ﬂoor of $5 and a ceiling of
$15 on local initiation fees, and
give new power to the locals re-
garding reinstatement fees and
assessments.

Discussion by the delegates
indicated that many locals have
already established at least $5
minimum dues in expectation
of the percapita increase.

A n 0 t h e r convention-adopted
resolution authorized the Execu-

, tive board to submit for refer-

endum vote a revised wage
structure for the International
officers and staff as well as a
plan for future increases “com-
mensurate with the raises ne-
gotiated in the basic sections
of our industry.” Reasons em-
phasized in support of the pro-
posal were the facts that the
Mine-Mill officers and staff are
among the most underpaid in
the American trade union move-
ment and that they have not re-
ceived any type of wage in-

crease since 1957.

Backs Amendments

ginning in 1963, International
conventions be held on odd-
numbered years with enlarged
district conferences to be held
in the alternate years for dis-
cussion of union program-, legis-
lative and political matters and
union "education.

In this connection, the amend-
ment also provides that, after
1963, International conventions

.be held during the month of Au-

gust in the headquarters city of
the International Union and,
also after 1963, that Interna-
tional elections be held on the
third Tuesday in October of
convention ye ars with all of-
ficers taking office on the fol-
lowing Jan. 1, and that other
dates in connection with the
election procedure be adjusted
accordingly. . '

The convention approved
holding the referendum on
constitutional amendments this
year in the month of Septem-
ber because of bargaining and
election activities in various
sections of the union during the
next few months. The approved
resolution further provided that
the Canvassing Committee will
meet in October to officially
tabulate the ballots and certify
results -and amendments
passed to become. effective‘ De-
cember 1, 1962.

years in any of the designated
hazardous occupations.

The bill is intended to be ap-
plicable to miners and to mill,
smelter and refinery jobs where
exposure to metallic poisoning,

toxic fumes and dusts and other‘

hazards is‘ present. Other haz-
ardous occupations which would
be considered under the bill in-
clude 10 g gin g and sawmills,
stevedoring, heavy construction
and others. ,
With its referral to the House
Ways and Means Committee,
steps are being taken to have
reports on the bill prepared by

the Social Security Board, the.

Public Health Service and the
U. S. Department of Labor.

These reports, it is anticipated, A

will help to lay a solid factual
base for congressional commit-
tee hearings on the measure in
1963.

!ll5l1*

MINE-MILL will enlist the
support of unions representing
workers in other hazardous jobs
at the hearings and in the final
legislative drive for enactment.

Congressmen Montoya and
King, who sponsored the bill,
are long-time friends of Mine-

iMill. Both have shown a keen

interest in non-ferrous metals
industry legislation and labor
and -welfare measures. Montoya
twice was an honered guest
speaker at Mine-Mill conventions
in the last four years—at Tucson
in 1961 and Denver in 1958.

Mine-Mill President John
Clark, speaking for the entire
union membership, has ex-
pressed heartfelt appreciation
for the constructive interest
demonstrated by Montoya and
King in the welfare of all work-
ers in hazardous jobs.
