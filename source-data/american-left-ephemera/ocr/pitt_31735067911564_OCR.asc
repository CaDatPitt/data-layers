Wages, healthand welfare

top 1953 contract demands

DEN VER—A general Wage increase of 15 cents an hour and a 6-point Health and Welfare program top the list of de-
mands drawn up by delegates to a series of /bargaining conferences here._ _ _ ’
The meetings, attended by nearly 150 delegates representing ‘the major sections of the industry, were described as “the
best,’ most Well-o_rganized and most productive” of any held by Mine-M111 in recent years.

In addition to adopting a fight-
ing program of demands to be
presented to non—ferrous em-
ployers at the bargaining table
this spring, the delegates ap-
proved a 10-point program to
lick the present .“crisis” in the
lead-zinc ‘industry.

They also planned, step by
step, a many-sided campaign to
win the overall bargaining de-
mands and to fulfill the program
to rescue the lead-zinc industry
from its current doldrums.

"‘()ur bargaining drive this
year will have to be conducted

not only at. the bargaining table,

and on the job, as in the past,
but also in Washington and the
state capitals,” the delegates
agreed.

THE MEETINGS, which were
spread over five days, included
separate sessions of the chain-
wide bargaining councils of Ana-
conda, Phelps—Dodge, Kennecott
and American Smelting & Re-
fining; a two-day Mining, Smelt-
ing & Refining conference; and
a National Wage Policy Commit-
tee meeting.

Highlighting the Health and
Welfare program is a demand
for a National Occupational Di-
sease Fund, to be financed en-
tirely by "the employers of the
industry through contributions

J

of one cent an hour for each
worker. ~ ‘ ~

The Fund, to be administered
jointly by l\‘Iine—Mill and indus-
try representatives, will provide
medical, hospital and rehabilita-
tion care for‘victi.ms of occupa-

--tional diseases —- especially sili-

cosis and lung cancer——in the, in-
dustry. . ,

THE PROGRAM also calls for
sickness and accident benefits of
$50 weekly starting with the sec-
ond day for any disability, re-
gardless of whether it is indus-
trial or not. The delegates agreed
to press for greater union con-
trol over all Health-Welfare plans

either through establishment of
Trust Funds or administration
by Joint Employer-Employee
Committees.

Close to the top of the “de-
mand list” were premium pay for
Saturday and Sunday work as
such, for an increase in pension
benefits to $125 monthly, for in-
creased shift differentials, and
for improvements in holiday and
vacation clauses.

HEADING the lead-zinc crisis
program was a call for active
union support of legislation to
treat with the problem of stabi-’
lizing the metals market. The

delegates here pointed specific-

ubsiaisy-that

 

ally to a Premium Price Plan,
such as the one which kept cop-
per, lead and zinc markets stable
through World War II, and to
“some of the better features of
the Johnson Bill (introduced by
Senator Ed. Johnson (D., Colo.),
a measure which would be more
acceptable to the workers if it
were amended to include labor
safeguards and sounder adminis-
trative provisions.”

President John Clark disclosed
that steps had already been taken
by the union aimed toward hav-
ing a Premium Price Plan bill in-

troduced shortly in the U. S.
Senate.

THE 10-POINT program was
also featured by a demand for
legislation to provide jobless
workers with direct aid “over and
above p res e nt unemployment
compensation standards.” and for
a shorter work week “wherever

technological improvements have-

already caused layoffs and will
be likely to create layoffs in the
near future.”

To carry out the 10 proposals
for relieving the ailing lead-zinc
industry, the delegates adopted
a program for action in com-
munities of western states to be
climaxed by an emergency con-
ference in Washington, ‘ D. C.
some time in May.

racism against lndians

VANCOUVER, B. C.——The snarling-

head of racism, directed against native

Indians, has raised itself in this ‘prov-
ince, and is beingfought by Local 898, -

Hazelton. _ ,

An English doctor has been ‘serving
that camp and district for some years,
but this month the B. -C. College of
Physicians- and Surgeons ruled that he

was not fully’ qualified for this prov-
ince, and could treat’ only Indians.

The implication is obvious, and

.Mine-Mill is doing its utmost in Hazel-«

ton to see that theydoctor is_ granted

The miners .of‘the local are perfectly
satisfied with his qualifications, and
_resent the slur on the«'natives. They
point .out that if he's good ‘enough for
the Indians, he’s- good enough for any-
one, and that his ‘qualifications were

[perfectly good in”England and also in
the neighbouring province of Alberta.

Protests to the College, which at its
last ' convention “regr_et_ted” deteriorat-
ing public relations, have elicited no
satisfactory response, the doctors prov-
ing quite as thick-skinned as their le-

- gal brothers to whom the practice;of

all sorts of discrimination is a right.
The local, and the B.C. District Union,
is active onthe case.

bia will have another election within ’

fiveeks, probably on June 8, which will
be just four days short of "a year after
the Social Credit Party won power.
The government, which has been
most obviously baiting the Cooperative
Commonwealth members of the legisla-
ture and the, Liberals and Conservatives

. to defeat itever since the session start-

ed, fell on a-“no confidence” motion
following a -debate on the proposed‘
educational program, which the Socreds
claim will shift the burden" of costs off
the municipalities. [ \
Liberals and, CCF claim the oppo-

site,. but nobody -seems to be able to _

give any cogent reason for holding one
view or another, so widespread is_ the
confusion over the-proposals. -

The Liberals, whose six members "'

have been holding the government in
power against the assaults’ of the CCF,
-have suffered, the worst sort of humili-
ation under the taunts of Premier Ben-

vnett and his ministers, who, /in order ~

to shift tl1e"responsibili_ty of an election
onto their shoulders, have done every-
thing in their power to force them to
the action which resulted March 24.
VOTE .on the educational .bill was
27 to 17 -, one of the- 18 Socreds rebelling
to vote with the opposition. _ '
An‘alte1-native to an election is that
the Lieuteiiant-Governor, should call on
the CCF to foim a government, de-

, pending on the support of the Liberals -

who held the Socreds in power, and
CCF Leader Harold Winch -has already,
according. to press reports, demanded
that this be-done. I “ "6 _ /

posed‘ to ,

But with the 'CCF’s «attitude, re-

. buffed in the last election but still ap-

parently unrevised, that labor can hope
for any concessions {only by putting-

'  Describing the crisis as» a national emergency, the delegates declared: ‘ .
7 “In the midstof the greatest war spending in our history,m,lead'
7 "and ‘zinc properties in the U. S. ai1d,Canada' are being shut down or
 ‘-are having: their operations._cu’r__tailed. Iron ore workers in Alabama
 _are out of work. Thousands of brass workers have lost, their .. jobs
since 1947. The unemployment situation at'Baltimore,AS&R is very- -*
V . There are strong indications that the current rough balance.
between the ‘supply andpdemand of copper is tenuous and uncertain.-
_ '_i n “In all areas where lead and zinc production still continues, op-.

' the workers. Many thousands of workers have beeh laid off’.
companies.-are using the present crisis as an opportunity to under-
, mine established wages and working conditions. V
_ those large companies which’are still enjoying high profit returns.”
.52 _ ' Two‘ main goals were cited by the delegates as “rnust”"ob.jec-
! 'tiVes in the drafting of any‘ program designed to meet the situation.
 They are (1) to administer to the immediate needs of our members,
 and (2) to stabilize markets. With these two objectives in mind, the
 Mining, Smelting, and ’Refining conference, and‘ subsequently ..the‘
..Wa'ge‘Policy body, adopted ‘the following; program: T

developments, highways, new schools,

hospitals, and rural electriﬁca,tion“_that A

will greatly increase the domestic mar-
ket for the metals we produce.” "

“7. Concrete steps toward interna-
tional labor relations with unions, in

tries, particularly Iin those areas ex-
ploited" by the same companies who
employ ourmembers. Raising the liv-
ing standards of workers in foreign

.,,countries will not only help them, but‘

is a matter'of self-preservation,_for ev-
ery member of Mine-Mill.

“8. Support of all movesﬁdesigned to‘

broaden world trade in“ order to open
up vast markets for U. S. and Cana-
dian metals.

“9. The initiation_ of a comprehensive
program of political action and com-
munity "relations which will . help our

to ‘overcome the present metals crisis.

“10. Support of steps designed to
achieve labor unity in the U. S. and
Canada in order to mobilize the full
support of ‘a'll'labor of programs do-

f signed, to -solvéhthe‘ -growing economic

N.W. Council

presses for
T0‘ 'pal'tern"

KELLOGG, ldaho——Delcgates to the
Northwest Mine-Mill Council meeting
here last. month expressed renewed
determination to win the 1952 wage
pattern of 8 cents and 2 cents through-

out the area, despite the opposition of -

the companies.

The conference also made clear a
fight will be made to get the. “pattern”
retroactive to last June 30. In addition,
the delegates went on record to demand
a new wage increase for the 1953 con-
tract, to be in line with the recommen-
dation of the Mining, Smelting & Re-
fining Conference in Denver.

Another recommendation called for
negotiation of 1953 contracts’ on the
basis of a 5-day week with no loss in
take-home pay.

. THE COUNCIL meeting was at-
tended by 42 delegates from three 10-
cals 18 of Kellogg and Wallace, 515
of Met-alline Falls, and 911 of Cobalt.
District 7 Board Member Chase Powers
and Int’l representat-ive‘s Lou Cochran
and Howard Goddard were present.
‘Thomas Lynch, the Spokaneattorney
who acts as counsel for some Mine-Mill
locals, was guest speaker. _

Ernest Wcinert of Local_ 18, retiring
president of the Northwest Council,
was chairman of the meetings. Acting
secretary was Peter Pickarski of Local
18. Vice President of the Council is
John Farley of Local 911. _

On recommendation of the political
action committee, the conference sent
telegrams to Congressmen Samuel Mc-
Connell, chairman of the House Labor
Committee, and Congressman Lee Met-
calf of Montana, demanding repeal of
the ’I‘a.ft-Hartley Act‘ and re—enactment
of the Wagner Act.

THE DELEGATES proposed that all
locals set up political action commit-
tees, and that the Council set up a
permanent‘ publicity and mobilization
committee.

Also adopted was a resolution on the
lead-zinc crisis, which declared:

“That we join with other groups to
put pressure on the industrialists of
this country to correct -the conditions
that they have created in the lead and
zinc industry. We must demand Work in
this industry, at a living wage, and
whatever “stopgap” measures must be
taken we urge the International Union
to avoid anypolicy or program that
will place any responsibility on our
Union for the present or the future
condition in the world market of lead
and zinc.” _

The delegates elected the following
Council oi:‘ficers for the 1953 term: Jess
Daley, Local 515, Chairman; Dale
Starmer, Local 18_, Vice President; Bill
Moore, Local 18, Secretary. ’

Real estate lobby moves
against GI mortgage rates

Veterans who may some day want
to get a GI home mortgage had better
watch out.

The real estate and mortgage loan
lobby is moving in on vet’s organiz -
tions, in a campaign to raise interest
rates on G1 mortgages. The American

~\Legion., has appointed Milo Warner
_to a special committee to “explore the
possibilities of improving GI Home
Loan facilities.” ,

Warner for years has been a regis-
tered lobbyist for Prudential Life Ins.
Co., which doesn’t like the competition
of low interest rates on Glhome loans.

‘Ike hike’

TACOMA —— (FF) —— An “Ike
hike” in copper prices has boosted
Tacoma Smelter profits $480,000
a month, according to Mine-Mill

lion pounds a month.

_ The $480,000 profit boost is

tions of the industry.

President Orville Larson and Secre-
tary-Treasurer Maurice Travis also
spoke._District ,3 Board Member Ray-
,mond. Dennis gave some helpful sug-
gestions on coordination of bargaining.
In two busy days, of meetings, the
delegates hammered out a program of
bargaining demands and mobilization’.
IN ADDITION to recommending a
wage demand of 20 cents an hour to
the National Wage Policy Committee,
the delegates agreed to fight for 8

control over‘ administration of the
plans. »

for time-and—one-hall‘ for all Saturday
work, double time for Sunday work,

er seven years, and four weeks after 15..

 \Vage increase is best, defense

DENVl:3l{—A sizeable wage increase for the nation’s workers is the “first and best defense” against
a serious depression now on‘the horizon, Int’l Vice President Orville Larson declared in a speech at the
opening of the'Mining, Smelting & Refining Conference here.

Calling attention to the fact a
“serious slump” has already hit
the lead-zinc industry, he said:
“Production has been curtailed
throughout the industry. Many
mines have already shut down.
One of our lead smelters has
been completely shut down. Oth-
ers have sharply,curtailed pro-
duction. 'iVIany thousands are
unemployed right now in the
heart of the industry.”

The depression danger “makes
a wage increase more necessary
than ever,‘ rather than less,”
Larson declared. “A dangerous
gap has developed between our
ability to produce and the work-
er’s abilityvto buy back the ‘goods
that are produced.” :_

“Profits in this industry are
still at a very high rate,” he
showed, and pointed to the ex-
ample of the American Smelting
& Refining Co., which in 1952
enjoyed profits “nearly twice as
much as they made during the
best years of World War II.”

“Actually,” he said, “there’s
not a single “one of the larger

Wcompanies in this industry that

‘ could‘ not afford to pay higher "

' wages and still maintain very
substantial profit levels.

"‘As a matter of fact,’ the
largest companies. with “which
we deal are right now making
-the biggest profits theydever
‘made. With copper sellingat 28’
to 34 cents a pound they’re
scooping up profits almost faster

_ than we can shovel out the ore.”
 ., ,The, Mine—Mill vice president,
who is also national bargaining

1 Speaking confidently about.the
outlook for .1953 negotiations",
Larson toldthe delegates: “Let’s

we have in the past, as a solid

we’re going to be more united

,DENVER——The Mine-Mill Executive Board last week hailed the “fight back spirit”  p i'ezidini4g.Ii_

among the American people, and called fora broadening of unity among 1’l0l'l-f€l.‘l.'0l1S metal workers" to '1

win their bargaining goals.-

The Board’s policy statement
was issued after the weekend
round of bargaining conferences
at which Mine-Mill’s 1953 wage
and contract goals weregset.‘ 

The statement was ‘vkeiyedi; to.

the declaration that as "bargain-

ing opens this year, ‘_‘things are

different.” It said :

O“'l‘he rEisei1howei' Adminis-'

‘ . o . . . . . ,‘ .-
tration, with its ‘Billionaire (.2151-
net,’ makes things _d.ifferent,.‘.

O “-The danger of a dep’i'ession

soon not only in the non-ferrous,

metals industry but in all Amer-
ican industry, makes things dif-
ferent. ‘  ..  ,

O “The ‘fight back"_ spirit --
spreading among workers, 7 farm-
ers, professionals, small business-
men, aliens and naturalized‘ citi-
zens, Negroes and Mexican-

Ainericans — makes things dif-

ferent, too.” '

THE MINE-MILL leaders ex-
pressed confidence that “we can
win good settlements this year

in every section of our iiidusti'y’__’.'
despite the fact that “depi-ession A

has already hit” the lead-Zinc
sections.  0 I
“Our bargaining drive,” they
said, “will have to be'cond'ucted
this year not only at the bai‘gfain-
ing table and on the job,,'as,,in
the past, but also -in Wash'i’n’g-
ton and the state capitals.’’:’_
The statement showed convic-
tion that “the bonds of unity
can now be strengthened as nev-

er before among ourselves, with-,
.in our communities,'wit_h other

workers in our industry, witli

The Board applauded the re-
cent statementsof the“A_FL and
CIO pi'eside‘nts on the need?” for
labor iinity, and added that “we
intend to make itvknown thru-out
this industixythat we invite and

As two5 key reasons why pres-

sui"e for‘ jla_b,oi- unity is mounting,
the ‘Boa_rdf' pointed to “the danger
of__ a'ii1e'ndii,i'ents to worsen Taft-
Ha,i‘tley,”3a'nd,:“the danger. of an
early dep‘i°,e's“sio~n.” ’ _

Board added that ‘_‘while there is
growing disillusionment and wor-

Rather there is deepening ‘fight

many ways, on many fronts.”
The statement listed thefiglit

against a worse Taft-Hartley,’

for labor unity, as examples of

J_enner’s “standby” plan has now

forced -to live under substandard condi-

wage freeie which depresses the real

viously record-breaking profits of the

average rate of total reported corporate

Forgotten

Not many people know _it, hut there
is a clause in all. government contracts
forbidding employers to discriminate in‘
employment on grounds of race", creed,
color or national origin. .

Thereason so few people know about
it is that the law is “almost forgotten,’
dead and buried.” That’s- what the
President’s Committee on Government

,‘Contract Compliance said recently. The

-committee repoi'ted that neither govern-
ment agencies nor con_tra_ctors are pay-
ing much. attention’ to the clause.

SENATOR MALONE, Pat McCar-

‘ ran’s. Republican buddy from Nevada,
-wants to amend the ‘oil giveaway to

provide that the states will also get

~mi~neral rights to ‘federal land within «
' their boundaries.

tMalonev’s plain simply" proves that
Senator_Kefauver, the Tennessee Demo-
crat was right when he. chai'ged,that‘-ii.’

- they give offshore oil away, the special
"interests will soon bepclamorinlg for the

national forests,‘ public lands and parks,

«and other natural resources‘ in the in-
terior. states.

“This legislation is just a step toward
a policy of giving away all of our na-
tu1'al‘i‘esoui'ces,” Kefauver said inan
attack on the $40 billion oil grab.

Former Interior Seci'eta1'y Oscafi
Chapman agrees with Kefauver. He
estimatesthat the value of public do-
main,,_totallir_ig about 693 million acres

_in national forests an_d parks, wildlife

refuges and public lands, worth more

than $1‘ trillion is at stake-in “the

greatest give-away program in the his;
tory of-tl1e’.world.”\. ‘

THE GRAB . for publiclpoxverv lwo‘n,’t :

-

that the co-ops of the Rural Electrifica-

‘ tion Administration, cities, public utili-«  ‘i
ty districts and other publiclbodies get . 
first rights to the purchase of po\w'er-VIE‘

from ‘federal dams. .

If the preference clause is knocked 
out, the utility companies will then be 

allowed~to make "long-term contracts
with the agencies that sell federal eleg;-A ' ‘

tric-power, That will not only spell the. 

end of the whole public power program; '

it will mean all the government power 

facilities will exist only ' to provide

.Dl'0fit fol‘ D1'iVa_te power corporations. 
Even more serious than- the power.
question is the remark dropped by Sen. 

Hugh Butler,-' Nebraska Republican,-
who is chairman‘ of the Senate Interioiél
Committee. When. the tidelands ques-
tion is settled, said Butler ‘5t.here'are-
plans for the introduction of a bill that
will make the same theory applicable;
to public lands now held by the federal A
government within the state.” ' 

Both the NAM and the U. as.‘ Cha‘

‘ ber of Commerce have been campai

ing ‘along the same line ever since"

WASl‘llNG’l‘UN —— Powerful
forces in both parties in Con-
gress have united behind drastic
new legislation to give the gov-
ernment life-or—death power over
every union in the U. S.

The legislation is in two bills,

'. exactly the same. introduced by
Congressmen from Arizona, .8.
state in which Mine—Mill has im-
portant locals. They are: Sen.
Barry Goldwater, who introduced
 S 234, and Rep. .lohn J. Rhodes,

A who introduced HR 3993.

The bills would combine and
extend the worst features of the
Smith Act, the MCC-arran police
state act, and the McCarran-
Walter immigration act, and ap-
ply them directly to organized

 . labor and labor leaders.

, . THESE BILLS come directly
7' ‘ from the National Association of
l\'Ianufacturers and the U. S.
Chamber of Commerce.

The Goldwater-lthodes bills
would repeal the non—communist
 _ - affidavit provisions of Taft-Harte
ley and grant power to the Sub-
versive Activities Control Board,

  

which operates under the M?-

Carran act, to decide what
unions can do business and what
labor leaders can take part in
that business. Powers granted
by the bills are so broad that
the Board could ban any indivi-
dual or union it sees fit. ‘

‘=‘ If outlawed by the Board, any‘

‘union which continues to oper-
ate would be subject to a fine of
‘$10,000 a day for every day it
.does business. Any labor leader
—who continues to work with the
‘union after the Board has turned
‘thumbs down on him would. be
_subject to the same daily fine to
imprisonment up to five years
for every day he continues to

function. E
The bills have won support
 from leading Republicans and
 .Democrats in the House and
' V ‘from such powerful Senate'lead-
'_ers as Robert A. Taft (0.), up-

 

 

‘per house floor leader, Chairman,

.H; Alexander Smith of the Sen-
ate Labor Committee, New York
Democrat‘ Herbert Lehman, and
West Virginia Democrat Mat-
thew Neely.
_.._._..»- THREE TOP labor leaders
“who died recently—-AF L Presi-
dent .Green, C10 President Mur-
z ‘ray, and CIO Vice President
Haywood — all bitterly attacked
‘similar proposals when they

Humphrey committee early last.

year. . .
f The new bills are designed to
' look -like a substitute for the
non-communist affidavit require-

inelit in the Taft-Hartley act. In
actuality they would endanger

.. every union leader who dares
work for a strike fora higher

wages or better working condi;

_tions and every union which

dares put forth any real demands.

 If passed, they could satisfy

’ labor legislation and allow the
Eisenhower administration to

pass some minor amendments to

T-H and claim it had fulfilled its
pre-election pledges for a change.

Under them, a union would be

PHOENIX, Ariz.—A strong
warning that the Goldwater-
Rhodes bills can destroy unions
came here from Glen Slaughter,
research director of the AFL
Labor’s League for Political Edu-
cation.

In aspeech before the Arizona
Federation of Labor, Slaughter
hit Sen. Barry Goldwater ‘and
Rep. John Rhodes as anti-labor.
Goldwater, he said, “has wasted
no time in getting himself stamped
as the most prolific fountain of
anti-labor legislation in years.”

“First he introduced a neat
8-line amendment to shortzcircuit
the Taft-Hartley act and permit
state legislatures to outlaw com-
pletely the right to strike or picket
for any purpose. He would have
been more honest if he had just
asked Congress to outlaw uniom.

“But that was only the begin-
ning. Last week, Senator Gold’-
water introduced a massive 27-
page bill (S. 254) supposedly de-
signed to curb Communist unions.
In practice it would give a fish-
ing license to the McCarran act
control board to probe into the
affairs of unions everywhere and
decide which unions and employes
it wished to purge. it could order
"out or business any ‘ union that
ever -advocated anything t.he.Com-

income taxes and public schools.

“No bill in recent years has so
closely resembled the thought. con-
trol so characteristic of totali-
tarian regimes."

_ Meantime, it was learned from
government records in Washington
that Congressman Rhodes got
$1990 in campaign contributions
from the estate of the big Penn-
sylvania oil boss, Joseph Pew.
Asked about it by a Federated
Press reporter, Rhodes said:
“Sure I got the Pew check for
$1,000 . . . I was glad to get. it."
Rhodes admitted he was a small
town lawyer before winning elec-
tion to Congress last fall. Living

said, he had little interest in labor
affairs until he got to Washing-
ton. He did not explain how he
happened to get a seat on the
House ’labor committee in the
same mysterious way Goldwater‘
won his place on the Senate labor
committee.

Despite denials <from Rhodes,
the interview supported conclu- "
sions of labor observers that the
Goldw-ater—Rhodes bills represented
the climax of a long campaign by
the National Association of Manu-
facturers and U. S.. Chamber of
Commerce for laws that would
give them complete control over

*    Not A PEEP

 Newbills would givegovernment
|ife-or- eath power over unions

      
  

IN OTHER WORDS, if a union
is for a wage increase and the
Communist party also favors a
higher wages, the union can be
cited as a “communist labor rep-
resentative,” have its NLRB bar-
gaining certification taken away,
and ordered to go out of business.

Labor observers here point
out there has seldom been an im-
portant-strike that was not at-
tacked by some government lead-
ers as aiding the communist
movement. 3 E“
