DENVEI-1——An appeal for quick action by Congress andjthe Eisenhhower Administration to relieve

the sick lead-zinc industry and thousands of jobless lead-zinc "workers was presented by our Union to the

House Select Committee on Small Business in hearings here April 22-23.

In addition to Vice President Orville Larson and Secretary—Treasurer Maurice Travis, members of.‘
four Mine-Mill locals in Colorado and Utah. were on hand to tell the Congressional Committee about the s i
plight of the industry-and outline their proposals for restoring it tofull, stable production.

The Denver hearings opened a series in which the Committee got on-the-spot reports of what is hap- ‘ _ “‘

pexTT‘n'g“ in these two important base
metal industries. Reports .on the Spo-
kanii, San Francisco and Phoenix hear-
ings can be found on page 10.

The Mine-Mill testimony took ‘up
most of the afternoon on the opening
day, after a parade of small mine op-
erators had spoken. Travis and Larson
called the attention of the Committee
to the ‘-‘wide areas of ag‘i:eement” be-
tween the position of the small op-
erators and that of our Union.

HEADING the program presented
by Mine-Mill was an urgent request
for passage of the Premium. Price
Plan (8. 1539) introduced by Sen.
James Murray of Montana. =Larson

suggested two important amendments

to strengthen the bill.

The Mine-Mill program called for
three major kinds of action:

1. Relief of the industry, “key to
which is passage of the Premium «Price
Plan bill.”

2. Relief of lead and zinc workers,
including mueh higher compensation
for those who are unemployed, and 8.
substantial wag'e.lncrease for those

it who have jobs.

3. Increased consumption of both
lead and zinc, not only in the United
States but in many other parts of the
world.

The CIO Steelworkers, which has
locals in Utah, and the AFL, which.‘has
locals in Colorado, were not repre-
sented at the hearings, even by ob-
servers. ‘

In a detailed analysis of the lead-zinc
crisis, Travis expressed fear that “the
ailments from which the lead and zinc
industries are now suffering may soon
infect-other metals, including copper."

SHOWING that the small operators
are victims of the same forces which
have thrown lead—zinc workers out of
jobs, the Mine-Mill secretary said:»“We
believe relief for the small operators
will mean restoration of good health
and stability for the entirtindustry.”

Lead-zinc consumption in the U. S.
has not gone down, he pointed out, as

/

he blamed the recent slump in metal
prices on the fact that_“the metals
which normally were flowing from
Mexico, Australia, Canada and Africa
to England and the rest of Eastern
Europe have been pouring into the
U. S. market in a mounting flood dur-
ing the last 8 to 10 months.”

The special meaning of the imports,
he said, lies in the fact that “control
of the most important metal operations
abroad is in the hands of U. S. cor-
porations. The major increases in lead
and, zinc imports from Mexico, for
example, came as the result of deci-
sions made by men who run the Amer-
ican Smelting & Refining Co. and the
American Metal Corporation.-

“These metals are ‘foreign’ only in
the sense that they come from mines
located in other countries; the control
-——and the profits—are in the hands of
corporations which have their head-
quarters in New York City,” he said.

LARSON’S testimony, which spelled
out our Union’s program in
called the Committee’s attention to the"
fact that the Murray. Premium Price
Plan bill “is designed specifically to
encourage small and marginal lead and
zinc mining operations——it aims to put
the small businessman in the lead-zinc

_ industry back into business.”

Larson suggested two amendments
to make the bill more workablel Point-
ing out that the payn nt ‘of subsidies
under the bill is lim'i d entirely to
the needs of_t-he national security

stockpile, he said it would be better to I-
“create a separate stockpile for the . '1
express purpose of promoting‘ conser-
vation of resources and stabilizing
metal prices."

‘ This approach, Larson argued,
“would serve to separate the issue of
metal market stability from the shift-
ing winds of the Cold War."

The Vice President also urged that
Congress knock out the proviso which
would stop payments‘ whenever an
operator paid wages higher than those
prevailing in the district. In its place
he suggested an amendment requiring
employers who‘want the benefits of the
plan to observe minimum standards of
health and safety, and to pay at least
the prevailing wage in the district.

FOR RELIEF of lead-zinc workers,
the Union spokesman proposed three '~
kinds of action: 1. Direct federal as- ‘_
sistance \over and /above unemployment . 
compenytion. 2. An - immediate and ‘A 

-» adequate wage increase in those lead

and zinc operations still in production; » ..
3 , Lower income taxes on workers and i -- ' ..
especially an increase in tax exemp- ‘‘
tions to at least $1,000.

Larson also showed how consumption
of lead and zinc can beistepped up both I‘
in this country and abroad. “We be- .
lieve. Congress should undertake ima ‘
mediate and favorable consideration of
the many bills before it which provide
fora tremendous program of new pub- A ;
lll' works,” he said, “all projects which » ...
are urgently needed by the American
people and the American economy." A .

And he went on: “If, as all Ameri- -,'
Fans ‘WP? and DH)’. WE! are now enter-— » I
mg a period in which the Cold‘ War
tensions «will be relieved, there is the 
opportunity for removing at least some ' 
of the barriers which now block all ‘
trade with eastern Europe and China,
This would, of course, result in an im-
mediate improvement in the ._lc-ad-‘zinc
situation in this country.” I’ ‘

‘Why such o -fund i I I ‘
is necessary

Dust diseases, according to the
U. S. National Resources Board,
present the greatest health men-
ace to miners, whether in coal or

’ in metal mining. More miners are

° ing excessive amounts of dust
than are killed by mine explosions,
fires and mine accidents.

Bureau of Mines states that a ma-
jority of dust” disease cases
are not recorded. However, even

cases of occupational. diseases
, were reported as compensable in
1948. '

Even though some of the min-
a ing states provide for. compensa-
tion and medical care "for vic-
tinis of industrial diseases, such
as silicosis, the scope of benefits
and the extent of medical «care
provided are limited.

FOR INSTANCE, in states like

 Answers to questions on I
 Occupational Disease Fund

ONE OF the key-demands of Mine—Mill’s 1953‘_‘bargaining
program is creation of an‘ Occupational‘ Disease Fund. The
.’Fund is to be established through a one-cent per hour‘con-
tribution «by the employers.’ The _Fund would be administered
jointly by the industry and the International Upion from
Denver. Setup as altrust fund with joint ‘administration,
 sugli a fund meets the requirements‘of law. ‘

tims.'_ot' industrial" diseases who
can no longer. work In the 1ndus- ,

‘try and-are subsisting on measly

handouts of welfare agencies.

The Fund would undertake the
’purchase of pressure breathing
machines and similar devices
which can be installed -inpvarious
hospitals, or be available at Local
Unions to aid victims of silicosis
where such equipment is not avail-
able atithe present ‘time.

THE, FUND" would establish co-
operative relations with State
agencies such. as universities
which are studying the cure and
of ‘indus- *
trial diseases.

The Fund can be‘ an important
instrument in bringing about the
collection of complete statistics on
occupational diseases in the smelt-

_ ing and refining industry..

If the true’ facts are known,,‘the
legislative campaign of the Union

to secure greater’ Federal and ,- . b

State assistance in the care of oc-
cupational disease victims would
be _.substantially improved.. I

I Would such a Fund’ foke over 

the functions , , _, . — ,
of Workmen's".Comp_ensal_‘ion?  ;
No.‘ The * varicjus goccupationali _
disease laws, -as "was 'pointed out
above, provide*only limited medi-*
cal care. Many workers in our in-
dustry cannot’ even qualify. for‘
those benefits ‘because of peculiar
eligibility requirements. The :ac-
tivity of the Fund Vwould be to

 siipplenient the benefits available I’

under‘ Workmen’s Compensation
o‘r Occupational Disease Laws.

Would-the demand for em-
ployer confribufion fo the
Fund make" an employer pay
twice for ‘the same purpose
—fo the ,Fund and fo‘ Work-
meg's_ Compensation?

’ This demand will "not make the
employer pay even half of the to’- ’.
tal cost which the industry ‘should

‘properly be paying for cgre -and

compensation of industrial disease

If the Workmen’s Compensa-
tion and Occupational Disease

- laws were" adequate, the cost of-

such compensation to the ‘industry
would be . considerably ‘ , higher ,
than it is at" the present time. '

City n1ayo1,'s,.county officials, state legislators and the operators

O nthemselvxes are attending public hearings and are respondin’g positively

to our approaches forsupport. Greater effort must; be made to involve
other unions in the industry in this activity. . ‘ '
Clark, Larson, Wilson and,I have divided our time in appearances
before House Select Small Business Committee Hearings in Denver,
R Senate Labor Committee in Washington,‘
D.C. The notable thing about‘ these‘ hearings‘ is that our Union had
extraordinarily large rank-and-file delegat_ions which made a sharp

impression _on public officials and community forces.

The keen interest of ‘ our[members, sparked by increasing un-
em loyment and short work weeks is typically indicated by the District

 5‘ ‘ elegationof 19-who went the longdistance to Washington, D. C.,

when only 10 were expected. _

_  The operators are calling for tariffs. We oppose tariffs and sup-
port the Premium Price Plan Bill which Senator Murray of Montana
has introduced a.t the request of our Union. In spite of this and some
other disagreements,_ the significant fact is that. there is unanimous
agreement among the operators, public officials,‘ our Union and all
other elements, that something mus,t’be done about the situation.
That’s progress. , . Q ,' ‘ ’

’ Company carelessness

Dateline, Aganuec, Mexico, April 27-28 miners were killed and
.35 mo_re badly injured at the Delores Silver Mine operated by the
A'1nerican_Smelting a.nd_ Refining“Company. The explosion and jfire -
were caused. by short circuits in electrical cables which touched off
dust and gas explosions. V ‘ .

This trag_edy, whose-‘victims a_.re our fraternal brothers in the

/

«-Mexican Miners Union, is highlighted nearly every’ day by word of

increasing°deaths and accidents of miners of our own Union. .

* Int’l Rep. Ike Bayliff reported that speed-up has caused»-the deaths
of three worker's within the last 30 days at Bingham Canyon, Utah.‘
A machineman on the powder gang was killedland another seriously

  injured in a premature‘ blast. A brakeman was dragged to death
" beneath a train‘aﬁd a helperon the powder gang was elegtrocuted.

A The situationin our industry is so bad in respect to safety con-
ditions that it is not even possible, except through reports from our
own members to find statistics as to the frequency and severity of
accidents. ‘ '~ ‘ I —

‘This dramatically‘ underlines the importance‘ of Mine-Mill’s Acci-

NEW CALUMET, Quebec——The lead-
zinc slump, which has been growing
worse in western Canada and the U. S.
for months, hit this area early in‘ April,
when 200 members of Local 880 were
laid off at‘the New Calumet mines.

The Union took prompt action to re-
llieve the immediate hardship on the
workers and. their families and to cam-
paign for a resumption of. lead-zinc
production. , , _-

Bill Kennedy, Mine-Mill Int’l repre.-
sentative, got -in touch with the nearest
unemployment insurance office at Hull,
60 miles away,’ and arranged for two
officials to set up a temporary office
in New Calumet to register-the’ laid-
off workers for jobless benefitsf x

NINE DAYS after the sudden‘ lay-
offs were announced, the Union held a
public meeting in New ‘Calumet by

. mayors and council members from sev-

-i_o¢A._5wmE I ‘ Larson fellsiwhy UIHOH

opposes tariff proposal,

In.his testimony before the House Select Committee on Small

“ Business, Vice President Larson told why our Union does not sup-

port the sliding scale import tax bills introduced by Reps. Dawson
of Utah, and Simpson of Pennsylvania- The Simpson bill is backed
by the Colorado Mining‘ Association and some——but not all~—of the

small lead~zinc operators. Larson

“It is needless, I am sure, for me
to point out to this Committee that
the ‘sliding scale import tax’ is just
(mother form, of tariff. Our Union has
(L/vaxriety of objections to a’tari_ff as
(L solution to the present lead and zinc
crisis. Among them are these:

-1. “A tariff fails to recognize that
the problem is icorld—u'ide. It seeks to
insulate the domestic industry from
the rest of the icorld. To the extent’
that a‘turiff succeeds in keeping for-
eign metal out of the U.S., it would

i make it that much. more difficult for
foreign countries to "buy here. A crisis ,

-in world trade is at the root of the
lead-zinc depression. A tariff would«
be self-defeating since it would -merely
aggrcwute the world trade crisis.

.2. “We Iiave serious doubts whether
even (L sliding scale tariff would give
enough, protection to the high cost
producers. Because of widedifferences
in costs, such marginal opercbtors need

a_ great deal more protection than.

large low—cost on-iningo companies. A
tariff ichich gave inadequate protec-

said:

tion for small companies might easily
produdlz uindfrzll profits for the large
operators.

3. “Tariffs have ncrcr been -really
effective against foreign competition
in time of economic crisis. In. 1.93.4, for
eirumple, there uas (L J,-cent tariff duty
on copper, yet the U.S. imported 913,-

‘ 330 tons of copper——ulmost as much.

as our domestic mines produced that
year. All through the 1.%’()s the non-
ferrous metals industry suffered from
depres.~u'.on despitc‘the fact that they
were supposedly protected by a rela-
tirely high. tariff ~u'ull.

4. “The small producer who 'no'u)
needs the most aid -would get lea.»-t
fromincreases enforced by a tariff.
His slice 'u'ould_ comelonly AFTER the
smelter", railroads, power companies
and larnclovuvners‘got theirs. since their
charges are based on metal prices and
go up as prices increase. '

5. “Finally, a tariff would act as a
hidden tax paid by the consumer. This
would tend to force competitive sub-
stitution of other metals.”

Larson called the Committee’s attention to the fact that the

.Colorado Mining Association had rejected the sliding scale import

plan only three years ago. At that ti-me, Robert Palmer, executive
secretary of ' tlieaﬁssociation said: -“Is a "tariff free enterprise?
No, ,a tariff is a restricted economy; it is a barrier and an expensive

barrier- to foreign trade.”

and Congressman Paterson showed a keen interest in what the Connecticut

lead-zinc crisis, the loss of jobs in the brass industry,‘ the Union’s position
on T-H and new repressive legislation, the question of peace and prosperity,
and t_he need for protecting the jobs and earnings of the membership as
outlined in Mine-Mill’s program for peacetime construction and expansion

sponsor the calling of a Connecticut state-wide conference of industry
and labor to plan for transition from a wartime to peacetime economy.

Washington, D. C.—Top Mine-
Mill officers told the Senate
Labor Committee" in Washington
April 24 that the main concern
of Congress should be the grow-
lng crisis in the non—ferrous
metals industry and not further
restrictions on unions through
Taft—I—lartle_v amendments.
over 100,000 metal
miners, smeltermen and fabricating
workers, Mine-Mill Int’l President
John Clark and Secretary-Treasurer
M. E. Travis linked the “depression”
in lead-zinc and‘the threatening crisis

Speaking for

.111 copper with employer-—proposed re-

pressive legislation “aimed at re-nrlerisn g
this and other mrions impotent to re-
sist unemployment and ’wage cuts.”
“There is (L very close relationslz.ip,”
the officers pointed out, “between the
o-u’r‘re'nt picture, -not only in our in-
dustry but in the na.tion’s. economyus
a whole, and the proposals already
advanced here to furrther restrict and
shackle the flm(:ti0'nin.g of labor unions.
We.-see in the attack‘. of the‘Ame'ric¢m
Mimlvzg Congress on our Union a close

linlc, a. cause-and—effect tie, with the’

serious economic crisis in the lead—ziu.a
industry and to the threat of similarr
crisis in the copper industry. The real
basis for the com-plaiint against our
Union of the Phelps-Dodge Corp. in
its testimony on behalf of the American
Minirig Congress is determsined by u'ha.t
it has cost them in amigo gains and
other benefits urhsich our Union has
won for our mem.be7's.,”

AS‘ THEY SPOKE, Clark and Travis ‘

were flanked in the hearing room by
some 80 rank-and-file Mine—Mill dele-
gates from 28 local union: in 10 states
who had come to .Washington to lobby
for. the Union’s program.

The testimony presented by'Mine-

Mill followed an appearance beforov

the Senate “Committee by United Mine
Workers chief John L. Lewis, and

prior» to an intensive day of visits to senators and congressmen from their areas '

proceeded the testimony of UE Presi-
dent Albert Fitzgerald and Legislative
Director Russ Nixon.

Chairing‘ the Committee hearing
Wlien the Mine-Mill officers began
their testimony was Senator Goldwater
(Rep, Arizona), co—sponsor of the

Vxunion-busting Goldwater-Rhodes bill.

The chair-.was later taken over by Sen-
ator Purtell (Rep., Conn.). Other Com-

mittee members present during the ‘

Mine—’Mill testimony were Senators
Murray (Dem., Mont.) and Kennedy
(Dr-m., Mass).

Clark and Travis, in their statements

to the Committee, cited serious unem-.

ployment and mine shutdowns already
creating a “depression” in the lead-
zinc producing areas of the west, and
warned that a similar crisis is showing

_ signs of developing in other sections of

the industry. They pointed to layoffs
now affecting workers at the AS&R
copper refinery in Baltimore, and de-

_ 4 scribed the situation in the brass in-

dustry, where nearly 10,000 workers in

Connecticut alone have lost their jobs

in the last five an a half years while

the employers continued to enjoy the
highest production and profits in his-

tory. .

On behalf of the Union, the officers

proposed a 2-point over—all program to

Congress to meet and solve the metals

crisis: ’

].Relief of the industry through im-
mediate atop.gap legislation like the
Premium I\’rice Plan bill (S 1539)
introduced by Senator James Mur-
ray of Montana; increased unem-
ployment cornpensation for ‘laid-off
workers; a substantial wige increase
for those still employed; and lower
taxes for all workers. O‘

2. A long range construction program,

including the building of new ‘low-
cost housing, schools, iroads, river
valley and rural electrification proj-
ects, as well as the expansion of for-
eign trade with all countries, to in-
crease: the production and markets of
metals‘ and protect the jobs and earn-
ings of our membership.

ley and restoration of the'Wagner Act
was called for by the officers. They
took a strong slap at T-H injunctions
as “directed wholly against labor.” E

Stating that “the ea-z'ste7'1.ce of our
Union in the non—farrons metals in-
dustry has contributcr.l enormo‘usly_ to
the fact that the inrlu.st7'y is one of
the most stable‘in the United States,”
the Mine-Mill leaders cited the Union’:

record on wages and sti-ikes,"showing

that “buying power of 'n‘o7‘kers in the

_metal mining 1'ndustry has‘ increased

more than in any othcr 1na_ior in.dustry”
and that “in the 60-yea/r history of this
Union there hcwe. lielill. only two na-
tional strilces shuttinf) down ‘the whole

Clark and Travis also recorded total
opposition to the American Mining
Congress- endorsed Goldwater - Rhodes
bill, charging that it “seeks to deny
employees the riglzt to selectt-heir ow-n
unions as well‘ as their o_2,cn"leade/rs.”

Declaring that “the basic" ‘principle
of modern labor legis-lotion" in Amer-
ica. is the free choice by labor of its
representatrives for the purpose of col-
lective ba-rga/ining ’ll.''ll-ll. '
the officers made the point that “the
corrollary proposition that urorlcers are
free to choose tlzeir Unions. is that
unions are free to choose their leaders.
Wz't.ho~ut one, you
other.”
. The Union leaders denounced “the

Regional Director

A FEW months ago our mem-
 bers at the copper refinery 9f
 the US; Metals Refining Co. 111
  Gé.rtere't,-'N.J. were faced with a'

7. bi -‘layoff. _‘ ‘ _
 _,;giNhen we began '00 dig mto the
 reasons for the layoffs, We dls‘
§’j"covered that it was largely flu?
. I  ,_to'.the fact that copper refineries,
-mostly owned by the same com-
. pany’ that. owns the Carteret
:5; -plant, had been established at
 ,-Mufulira in Northern Rhodesia,
 and Cerro de Pasco in Peru.

‘Natiirally, when*someth1ng_ is
. 3 happening thousands of miles
  that can reach right'.1nto
' our homes and deprive us of Jobs,
.7 , -we want to know what’s going on
I f. . why it’s happening‘ . . . and
 what we can expect for the fu-
turer. ‘Above all, we want to know
~whatf_we can do about it.

WITH THESE QUESTIONS in
gﬁlmind, we entered into correspondence
 ‘with the African Mineworkers Union
,_>”~’in Northern Rhodesia. At the same

time we started studying the situation

_from documents available here. This
. isrwhat We found: — s
Northern Rhodesia lies in the heart

  

of central Africa, just below the equa- —

tor. The climate, however, is-not ter-.

‘ ribly hot since Rhodesia is on a plateau,

“F -about 4000 feet high. Wheat, corn and

‘ tropical flowers grow side by side.

.;'For several _tliousand years the people
of this area lived by farming, dairying
and cattle‘ raising, and gold mining. \

In 1888 a British. fortune-hunter,
Cecil Rhodes, pulled a deal with the
chief of the _Matebele tribe, named,
Lobengula. Nobody knows what Loben-
gula got out. of the ‘deal, but Rhodes
-got apiece ofipapersupposedly giving
him tlerritoryiabout the size of all of
the}United States east of the Missis-
sippi. ' - .

- - ’QUITE NATURALLY, there were a
lot of African farmers who didn’t think
that Lobengula had any right to give

_ away their farms. They objected stren-
uously. “

To take care of that objection, a
new company was formed in the Lon-
don stock ‘market, called the British
.South,Africa Company. The main in-
vestment of the new company was in
machine guns, with which they.

, equipped a hired army.

.~j Thins equipped, the Company pro-

Nceeded to bring “civilization to the
natives” by burning down thousands of
farms and villages, slaughtering tens

-, of thousands of men, women and chil-
dren, and driving the survivors into
small restricted areas called “com-
pounds”. , .

In order to defray the cost of bring-

, .ing these “blessings of civilization,”

the Company instituted a per capita

'_ tax on every African. The tax had to

be paid in British money.‘ Unfortun-

ately, none of the Africans had any

British money.

_' -THE COMPANY ‘very cleverly

_solved this’ problem by imprisoning

. “any African wh9,c_o_uldn’t pay his tax.

j _“ He was then “-farmed out” to any kind-
ly plantation owner or mine operator

«(Who would -pay; the tax and let the

‘African work~it- out. Somehow, it al-

should be flowing\vith milk and honey,
there pours out a stream of blood
and money. 

A FEW YEARS AGO a belt of cop-
per ore containing 400,000,000 tons of
copper was discovered in the northern
part of Northern Rhodesia. British and
American companies immediately got
the mining rights. Top dog in the

Rhodesian Copperbelt is the American I

Metals Company, Limited, which con-
trols a major portion of the output.
This is the same company that owns
the U.S. Metals refinery in Carteret.

At first, only the mines were op- ‘-
aled.‘ When the companies discovered
how wonderfully profitable it was, they
started to build smelters and refineries
as well. Last year two refineries in the
Copperbeltcwere completed. Mufulira
now has an annual capacity of 72,000
tons of electi’ol_vtic copper. Nchanga
can put out 124,000 tons.

About 40,000 -Africans now work in
the mines, smelters and refineries of
the Copperbelt. According to the re-
port issued last year by the Labor..and
Mines Department of Northern Rho-
desia, the average earning for" African

ecopper workers for 30 days work was
74 shillings for surface workers (about
35¢ a day), and 89 shillings for under-
ground workers (about 45c a day).

This includes all overtime, bonuses,
etc. In addition, the report notes, the
African worker has rations issued by
the company valued at 20¢ a day.

IN THE FACE of these conditions,
the African copper workers have been
learning‘ how to fight back. In 1935
they struck against an increase in the
per capita tax. The companies pro-
-voked “incidents” which gave the police
an excuse to fire on the workers, kill-
ing five. The strike was broken.

Again, in 1940, the workers struck,
fighting for higher wages. This time
a manufactured “incident” resulted in
17 killed and 65 wounded. Again the
strike was broken. C

With this background, the mine op-

.\erators felt they could laugh when the
African copperworkers once again,
four years ago‘, started to organize a,
Union.

By last October, the African Mine-

 workers» Union had organized 30,000

African workers in the Copperbelt.
They presented a demand to the cop-
per companies for a wageincrease of
35¢ a day. The companies sneered, and
announced they’would increase wages
6c a day, but not a penny more. The
workers pointed to the fantastically
sky-rocketing profits ,of the copper
companies. . K

They were answered by the British
financial magazine, the Economist
(10/25/52), which reported:

“The demand of the African Miners
Union for 35c a shift would about

' double the money wage. If profits were

the sole'crite.rion, the companies could
afford the full 35c, but they assert
that ‘the .Africans are already beirg
paid all that is justified by the work
they do.”

southwest Africa in 1949. The property is controlled by two i.l.S. mining corporations-—‘
American Metals and Newmoni Mining. Notice the primitive tools and equipment which

these fabulously wealthy companies supply their workers.

tude of the companies,«the Union took
a strike vote. 23,585 members favored
strike action, 113 voted against. On
October 20th the African workers went
on strike throughout the Copperbelt.

The arrogance of the companies soon
turned to dismay as they saw the de-
gree of organization "displayedby the
African workers.

The 10,000 non’-union workers walked
.out at the Union's strike call, promptly
joined the Union.

The mine operators exp :cted that
the workers would be quickly starved
back to work when the company ra-
tions were cut off. But for months be-
‘fore the strike, the workers, from their
meager resources had been salting and
and storing away meat and other food.
Support from Africans in the country-
side had been ‘organized by the Union,
and contributions of food were being
sent in.

In any case, the constantly half-

‘starved workers were determined they

would die of starvation before they
would go back without an improve-
ment in wages. ‘
When the mine operators appealed
to the tribal chiefs to send scabs to
the Copperbelt, they found that the
Union had been there first and gotten
pledges of ’ support from the tribal
clans. “ '
WITH NO SCABS to go into the
mines and plants, and with the»Union
vigilantly on guard against any provo-
cations, the mine operators soon real-
ized that they were facing a new and

powerful force. The Africans could no
longer be sneered at, intimidated, or
abused beyondenduraiice. They would
insist on being dealt with an organ-
ized workers. '

After three weeks of total shutdown‘

in the copperbelt, the Companies let
it be known through conciliators that
they were ready to raise the wage of-
fer considerably, but preferred to do
it through an arbitration award. The
having demonstrated its
strength and discipline, agreed to this.
Shortly thereafter, an arbitrator
awarded the workers a wage increase
of 17c a day.

This represented a tremendous vic-
tory for the African workers. It is the
first time that the African workers
have been able to forge an organiza-
tion which could not be busted, and
which could make effective demands
from the employers. The Union is
stronger today than it was b€f01J the
strike. It’s victory has brought a burst
of new hope into the heart of every
oppressed African worker. -

IN A LETTER to this ‘writer, the
General Secretary of the African Mine-
workers Union, M. D. Nkoloma, com-
ments: “Honestly speaking, the em-
ployers here have taken a great ad-
vantage of the African Labour which
1S wholly cheap. The blame however
partly rests on them and partly on
the luck of not having well established

trade unions, from the "very scratch.

Presently however, we are forging
through with the experience we have.
It is an axiom that no employer will
grant higher wages and better condi-
tions to the _employees unless‘ they
ask for them; so we are in this stage.”

Brother Nk0i0ma's words indicate
that last‘ October's _strike,in the cop-

perbelt was only the opening ,shot in =

the battle for better wages and a high-
er standard of living for the African
copper wages. '

In that struggle, the African work-

ers should certainly .g'e_i;_ig’eye1“_3r support

from American copper'w'brkers.
THE C0PPERB.E5.T~.=.. ,Wor.l§ers - of

Northern Rhodesia ‘wfork‘fo’rf the same '

eornpanies we" do. In traditioiial fash-
ion, the Companies try toiuse under-

the wages of workers who ‘have man- _

aged‘ to win a higher sta_'ndard "of liv-

, ing. This is done by expanding‘ produc-

tien in the low-wage areas,'and cutting
production in the higher wage ‘areas.

‘This is already’ _happeni‘ng' in ‘the,
lead and zinc industry. Thousands, of
Mine-Mill members in "the. lead and

unemployed, while production is being

« It is still possible to stop Lyon's

As THE UNION goes to press,
President Eisenhower still has
not sent the nomination~to the‘

_ Senate. Mine-Mill members and
local unions can send their letters
and telegrams directly to the
President, protesting against
Lyon as a candidate for Director
of the U. S. Bureau of Mines.
Ask that someone be found for
the jobvnwho has at least as much
interest in .the ‘welfare of the

‘miners ashe has in profits for

. the mining corporations;

At the same time, lett rs and
telegrams should be sent to t.he~
U. S. Senators from your state.
If. the nomination is made. the
Senate must confirm it.~Dcmand
that your Senator vote to reject
Tom Lyon as a nominee for this
position, _which is so important
to the lives and safety of, metal
miners.

_P

only peanuts to the small operators
‘.‘The Director of the Federal Bureau
of ‘Mines is supposed to enforce the ad-
mittedly inadequate mine safety laws.
With Lyon in this job, ‘we expect the
accident, death and dismemberment
rates to go up sharply in the non-fer-
rous metal 'mining industry. Safety’
costs the corporations money. With his

_ background, Lyon can be expected to

look upon the saving of a few corpora-
tion dollars as more important than the
saving of miners’ lives and limbs.”

Labor ioins campaign to _ stop
'grab and giveaway’ program .

WASHINGTON, D. C.-—The national
campaign to _“educate the voters" to
the magnitude of the GOP giveaway
of America's natural resources took on
new vigor last week, after the‘ first
test vote in the Senate on the offshore
oil giveaway bill.

The Republicans and their multi-tril- j

lion dollar program ‘of raiding natural
resources won the test. But the opposi-
tion vote was so big that some ob-
servers began to argue for the first
time that it may be possible to lick the
giveaway. i

The test came on a motion by Sen.

‘Robert Taft to table a substitute bill

by Clinton Anderson, ‘New Mexico
Democrat. The Anderson bill. would

‘have kept federal title to submerged

oil off U. S. shores and ea1‘ma_rked rev-

WASHINGTON -— President’ ,Eise'n_-A

hower and th'eGovernors of 20 states, —

havebéen asked to takeup the lead-
zinc. emergency- when they meet ‘here

this Week-for the White House Gov- ,

ernors’ Conference. - -ix - A
_ The request was made by‘; _ the Inter-,,

"national Office,rs"of Mine-Mill. First
they sent letters -to Governors ‘of the '

20 states in which lead-zinc -properties,
h’a3ve’been affected by the slump in
lead-zinc prices. Then they wrote Presi-
dent‘Eisenhower suggesting that he

make sure the probldm is ‘among those ’

he talks over with the Governors.

‘ The 20 states whose Governors re-
ceived letters were: Arizona, California,
Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Mis-
souri,’ ~Montana, Nebraska, Nevada,

_New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,
Oklahoma, ‘

Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
Virginia, Washington and Wisconsinl,
,Enclosed- with the letters to the
President and, Governors were copies
of testimony which Mine-Mill spokes-
men presented to the House Select
Committee on Small Business i~n'Den-
ver during, its kickoff ‘hearing on the
lead-zinc -crisis.

~ POINTING our that the ‘lead-zinc '

situation “affects the business life and

well-being of communities in 20 states," .

the. Mine-Mill officers said: “We believe

this .fact alone‘r'aises"the crisis to the ,

level of a national emergency, the‘ ,5»-

lutio'n to‘which ‘must be found by ‘our _

national and state governments.”

-Among the first replies‘ was a letter. i

from Governor Charles H. Russell of

. Nevada who 'said, /“I am certain‘ that
‘ﬁthe ihformation contained in your testi-

mon_y will be ‘most helpful to me when

I confer -with«-President Eisenhower ,

relative to the.’ problem of the lead-

, zinc industry and the emergency which

now‘ faces that highly important’ seg-

»ment‘of our;<economy.”’, ' i ,

‘Another, from. G'i)'ve_rno.r Robert
Crosby of Nebraska," expressed the
hope that the crisis‘ “can be taken up

.when the, Governors__m_eet in Washing.

ton.”

The Unionis letter ‘to the White’

House ‘emphasized that Mine-Mill -is
supporting the Murra"y Premium Price
Plan bill, and added: “While we realize
that your Administration is generally

opposed to subsidies, we wish ‘to {all '

your» attention to the fact that unless
some such step is takejn quickly we face
a danger of irreparable harm to‘ two
of this nation's most vital resources.
Once a, lead or zinc -mine has been
flooded, it is prohibitively expensive

and frequently impossible to restore it '

to production.” _ _ ,
“_While there are certain 'act_ions’
which Congress ‘cangtake to relieve this
situation,” the officers said, “we "be.
have this is a national problem with
which the Executive Branch of the
Government must, also deal." ‘

THE ANDERSON bill was defeated
66 to 33, but seven Republicans joined
25 Democrats and Independent Wayne
Morse in opposition to the administra-
tion. Pat McCarran of-Nevada was one
of the 18~Democrats who joined 38f Re-
publicans in favor of the giveaway.

Division in the GOP camp gave heart

for building

‘to the “educational” campaign that had

been spearheaded by 20 days of Senate’
debate after the House overwhelming-
ly approved the oil giveaway bill. The

. campaign was joined by liberals of

both parties, as well as organized la-
bar. It had three goals: » _

1) To achieve, it‘ possible, the “faint
hope" of defeating‘ the oil giveaway at
this session, 2) to build a record in case

the Supreme Court throws out legisla-_ .

tion passed at this session‘ and a simi-

lar bill comes~in later, and 3) lay the ‘

groundwork for a campaign charge in

-the 1954 congressional el‘ectio_hs tliavt» -

the GOP is giving away the country to
the vested interests. ,  ’ 

_ For the first tinie since he became"
'~/ President, Dwight. Eisenhower’_o_penly 
‘stepped into Congressional debate ,to'
complain that the long oil bill debate
\ was holding up “vit;rl”,.1egis1aﬁon, ‘ 4- ;  V;
The oil giveaway would hand oVe._l‘ t’o”_~' ''
the’ states oil aifd gas reserves esti-_»;.'_,.,
mated to be worth between $50 and.‘ .
$300 billion. The states, in turn ‘would. i '

turn over the oil for exploitation by

the trusts. This is just one step in;_the_ ’

GOP Administration program aimed at

_ A turning over to the big private‘ cor- , _
porations -all remaining public lands, "

public power and public. water» rights.’
There, is still time to act against the
oil giveaway. 9
