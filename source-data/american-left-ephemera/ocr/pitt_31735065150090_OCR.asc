KELLOGG, Idaho — Local
18's Coeur d’Alenes strike
against Bunker Hill and AS&R
continued solid here as the
fight for equitable contract
settlements approached its
fourth month.

.New strength was added to
the picket line struggle in
growing support from a
widely. representative cross-
section of the public.

Int’l Rep. Tim Finley and

AS&R committeeman Rudy
1 Hanson, who have been mak-
ing contacts for strike sup-
port around the state, report
a heartening response from
many sources.

THE PAIR met with AFL-
-CIO officials in state head-
quarters to work out the set-
ting, up of machinery for
money collections and making
local union meetings available
for Local 18 speakers.

A prominent citizens com-
mittee has been created in_

Stevenson Highlight

LOS ANGELES, Calif. —-
Much has been written about
the Democratic national con-

. vention- which nominated Sen-
_ ators John F. Kennedy for
- President and Lyndon B. John-
’ .son for Vice President. .

But all reporters who were
there have shown one con-

_, clusion in common—that no
 matter how it looked on TV,

a (I the end result was a. triumph

for Kennedyfhimself, his fam-

A - ily, his friends and his superb-

 organization, even though the
’ ovation for Stevenson was the
" -convention highlight.

 the Republicans were putting
‘on their own show in Chicago,

  
  
 

 

and the conclusions were not
yet formally nailed down.)

THERE is hardly a re-

porter who covered the Demo-

cratic convention who didn’t
comment on its stage-managed
operations.

Political Editor Bert Hanna
of the Denver Post described
it as a “made-to-order pag-
eant,” and ruefully commented
on “the shocked liberals and
labor people who began talk-
ing violently about a floor
fight on the vice presidential
nomination” but who “sud-
denly became meek as lambs
after a high-powered platoon
of party strategists‘ passed
along ‘the word’.”

FROM start to finish, the
events of the convention ap-
peared to follow a prepared

script: A platform with a
flavor of challenge and broad
appeal, especially its strong
civil rights plank; a ticket in
Kennedy and Johnson that re-
calls the winning combination
of Franklin D. Roosevelt and
John Nance Garner of Texas;
and, as a final curtain in the
Coliseum, an image of all-out
party unity with South em-
bracing North, liberals salut-
ing Dixiecrats and defeated
candidates introducing the
victors. .
Nevertheless, whether — for
paper purposes only or not,

DENVER Critical
problems facing all workers
in the non-ferrous metals
industry and formulation of

a realistic program to meet A

them will occupy the main at-
tention of delegates to the
55th Convention of the Inter-
national Union of Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers.

The convention, marking
the 67th anniversary of the
union, will open on August 29
at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in
Denver, Mine-Mill headquar-
ters city. It is scheduled to
run four days, concentrating
on working sessions with a
minimum of speakers.

Preparations for the annual
gathering were being dis-
cussed at a meeting of the In--
ternational officers here as
the Mine—Mill Union went to
press. ‘

>l¢ * *

WHILE a blueprint of pro-
gram and action will be out-
lined at a meeting of the of-
ficers and executive board
prior to the convention, the
conclusions and decisions will
be made as usual by the rank
and file delegates acting in
the traditionally democratic
procedures of all other Mine-
Mill conventions.

Undoubtedly foremost in the

minds of the delegates as a. —

main problem to be tackled
is the industry’s employment
situation, the matter of lay-
offs-‘ and s peed up resulting
from automation and mechan-
ization in the mines, mills,
smelters, refineries and fabri-
cating plants.
tention was being given by the
officers to this problem in the
presently depressed status of
the brass section of the in-
dustry.

The arbitration victory came
in an award handed down July

brand of the University of
California, who heard the long-
standing grievance May 26.
The union’s case was handled
by Regional Director Jack C.
Marcotti, assisted by Local 937
President E. A. Lomeli.

Perez was fired May 18,
1959, -for allegedly falsifying
his time card regarding hours

758 Seffles ail"
Elesco Smelfing

A new one-year contract
settlement providing for 9
cents per hour in money in-
creases, an additional paid
holiday making a total of
eight and more vacation pay
was signed last month by Chi-
cago Amalgamated Local 758
with Elesco Smelting com-
pany.

The plant’s workers voted
to put 4 of the 9-cent increase
into a pension fund which is
already receiving 6 cents per
hour (10 cents per hour will
now be going into the fund).
They voted to take the other
5 cents on wage rates.

On the vacation provision,
workers receiving three and
four weeks vacation will get
two additional days pay. For
example: three weeks for 15
years which was 120 hours pay
will now be 136 hours pay;
four weeks for 25 years, for-
merly 160 hours pay, will now
be 176 hours pay.

Negotiating committeemen,

A assisted by Local 758 Business

Manager James Pinta, were:

Morencr Miners
Aid "Boys' Sl'a'l'e"

This year again, as for the
last five, Morenci Miners Un-
ion No. 616 has sponsored and
paid for sending two high
school boys (one each from
Clifton and Morenci) to the
Arizona “Boys’ State.” The
boys are nominated by the fac-
ulty of each school, with the
union making the selections
from those nominated.

On their return, the boys are
allowed to come to a regular
Local 616 membership meet-
ing and report on the activi-
ties of “Boys’ State.” The
boys have always stated their
gratitude for having had the
opportunity to attend the Jun-
ior citizens event. Much ap-
preciation has also been ex-
pressed by the superintend-
ents of both school systems
for the loca1’s participation in
the Boys’ State program and
making it possible for the stu-
dents to attend.

Union Wins Revere
Worker's Job Back

Several meetings with man-

the case to arbitration has won
back the job of a Local 700
member at the Santa Ana
plant of Revere Copper &
Brass company. He gained
reinstatement with full rights

after being fired for allegedly
failing to report for work at
the assigned time.

According to Int’l Rep. Hen-
ry Rapuano, investigation by
the shop committee revealed
that management had granted
the worker permission to ‘re-
port at a later time so he
could cope with a personal
problem.

Howard Reports On S:

East, Midwest Tour

T IS always a real pleasure for me to be out “in the .
field” to visit local membership meetings, meet with I
the local officers and talk with the rank and file mem-'-
bers. It’s not only a pleasure, but very instructive, be-.

cause I have discovered from long experience that when
I have discussions with the men from the
mine or shop, I always learn more than I
have to tell.

That’s the way it was on a recent trip
I took through the east and midwest, visit-
ing locals in parts of District 6 and Dis-
trict 3.

I was especially glad to visit Local 711
in Erie, Pa.., along with Brother Joe Seioli,
our International Representative in Buffalo
who also services the Erie local. It was my
first visit there and I was impressed with
the size and spirit of the meeting. ,

In my discussions with some of the
leaders and members, they- told me they were ready to pay
their assessment and were also preparing to send delegates to
the International convention. They were proud of their local
union, and. said their ‘grievance committee is on the job with
grievances being taken ‘up immediately.

1lr**

N my visit to Buffalo, N. Y. Local 593, which is part of the

American Brass Council, I could see from the shop stew-
ards meetings they are holding and the regular leaflets they
are putting out at the plant that their membership is being
kept prepared for the difficult negotiations they are in with
the company. .

The men there have cut out overtime work because of
their union‘brothers being laid off. It seems that as a result
some 22 or more men had already been recalled. This is a real
fighting local with an informed and experienced membership.
They, too, informed me they areiready to pay their assessment
and send delegates to the coming convention.

With Secretary-Treasurer Irving Dichter I participated in
a well-attended meeting of ABC Local 445 in Ansonia, Conn.,
where local president John Rapuano quickly disposed of rou-
tine business for more discussion on negotiations. The mem-
bership voted down the company’s latest offer and pledged full
confidence in their committee.

N my visit also to Local 423 in Torrington, Conn., Where

the joint ABC committee was negotiating with the com-
pany, I found the local committee to be in a fighting mood,

While I was there I participated in the ABC negotiations
which were led by Secretary-Treasurer Dichter with the assis-
tance of District 6 Board Member Al Petit-Clair, staff members
Joe Scioli and Mike Gazy, and the local leaders on the joint
committee.

LL of these men represent the traditional unity of the ABC -

Council, which I am sure the company has learned to
respect. They are keeping all the locals from other unions in
the Anaconda Conference informed of developments.

They have the confidence and determination to achieve a
decent settlement of their demands, and I feel sure they will.
I also visited with some 0-f the local leaders in Carteret and

A The session was held in the

, The conference acted to pro-

 " Vide for a coordinated PAC

JENKINS outlined the puny
record of Congress thus far
on labor and social legislation.
He blamed labor’s failure to
accomplish its legislative ob-
jectives on the lack of vigor-
ous leadership and compro-
mise position of many of the
country’s largest unions.

He also reported on the
Democratic national conven-
tion.in Los Angeles, giving be-
hind-the-scenes stories. The
adopted Demo platform is one
of the best in years, he said,
adding that heat must be
placed on congress to trans-
late it from paper to reality.

THE UNION’S aims in bar-

and civil rights must be ac-
companied by political and

ed. He said that political ac-
tion goes hand in hand with
PAC Work in the solution of
practically every problem the
union is concerned with.

Johnson outlined the ILWU
legislative program for the
coming session and urged
Mine-Mill cooperation to help
put it across. He emphasized
direct personal contact with
legislators to gain passage of
bills. '

 Anaconda Company Admits Guilt
in Great Falls Unfair Labor Acts

ANACONDA, Mont.—The Anaconda company has admitted guilt to Mine-Mill

 charges of unfair labor practices in Great Falls during-and-since the copper strike.
_ Similar charges against the company. in Anaconda for signing a separate. and ille-
 ‘gal agreement with Local 117 were completely sustained by the General Counsel of

The case arose when the

and dress and go to -the dis-

A couple of months ago, the
company unilaterally attempt-
ed to end this practice by in-
sisting dispensary visits must
be made after the shift ended
for which the casters would
be given a maximum of 15
minutes’ pay. ‘

Stark’s award sustained the
union’s argument that the
past practice in effect by mu-
tual agreement since 1942 had
to be considered part of the
contract, and ordered imme-
diate restoration of the one
hour's time allowance.

  Union's Seniority Check
Brings Pension Payoff

SUPERIOR, Ariz.——Tiburcio Lopez, retired by Mag-
ma Copper company here two years ago, is now richer
by $1,687.50 plus a monthly check of $116, thanks to

Mine-Mill Local 938.

The case was reported in the first issue of the Mine--

Mill Reporter, new printed
bulletin of the Magma-San
Manuel Mine-Mill Council.

Some time ago, Local 938
Business Agent Rodolfo P.
Garcia was checking the -new
seniority list. Noticing that
Lopez was not on it, he start-
ed to investigate.

He found out that on his re-
tirement Lopez was taken by
one of his daughters to the
company office without con-
tacting the union. Garcia fur-
ther
tired member was receiving
$85 a month disability compen-
sation, but was being shorted
$108.50 from Social Security.
He immediately went to work
on the case.

Because of an error in the
Social Security office, and
Magma’s records, the union
had to do extensive research to
produce evidence of Lopez’
age.

3B 3k *

MUNICIPAL, county and
state offices were queried;
churches contacted; birth cer-
tificate, alien registration card
and other records examined-

timore, Md'., was sustained in
an Arbitration award by Whit-
tley McCoy of the Federal
Mediation Board’s arbitration
panel.

The grievance arose last
March when the company
closed a department and laid
off all but 12 men for that
period, including departmental
steward Beverly Haskins. The
company said he could not
perform work available and
further maintained it was a
temporary, not permanent lay-
off.

The union argued that Has-
kins had top seniority, that
there was no such thing as
temporary layoffs under the
agreement, and that all lay-
offs are . in effect permanent
and subject to the contract
seniority provisions.

In supporting the union’s
position, McCoy " ordered the
company to: reimburse‘ Has-

‘. skins-,fo,r_ the time lost and fur-"

discovered that the re-,

until, nine months later, an
acceptable date was furnished
by the Immigration depart-
ment.

The payoff to all this union
work for a retired member
came when Lopez received a
back-benefits check for. $1,-
687.50 from Social Security,
plus a continuing Social Se-

curity check of $116 a month. '

Mott, I. L. Phillips and- Willie
Ed Palmer (Elesco Smelting)‘;
and Ophelia Rodgers, Local
758 office secretary.

mportant Arbtrations

ther sustained the union on
its ‘main points. He held that
under the agreement the un-
ion was correct in arguing
that all layoffs were subject
to the seniority provisions and
that there was no difference
in this respect between a lay-
off and a furlough.

Handling the union’s case
were District 6 Board Member
Al Petit-Clair, assisted by Lo-
cal 625 President T. Chandler
Taylor, Vice—President C. H.
Savoy, Fin. Sec. C. S. Ober-
lander, grievance chairman J.

Secretary-Treasurer:

Dichter Points Up
ldaho Strike Needs

HE STRIKE of 2,000 members of our Union in the
Coeur d’Alenes is now entering the fourth month.
The strike is resolving into a bitter and hard struggle.

Our membership is confronted by a united employers
group determined not only to deny them the wages and
working conditions won throughout the rest
of the industry this past year, but to wreck
the standards they have so long fought for
and succeeded in establishing.

This strike is but a continuation of the
struggle which began over a.- year ago in
our industry. The issues are the same and
the companies’ behavior is following the
pattern established by the big four of the
industry.

To date the Coeur d’Alene strikers have
supported themselves. ‘

They have used «the resources of their
own strike fund to help those of our mem-

bers in need of assistance. They have done an outstanding job
in organizing the procurement and distribution of food. They
have rallied many AFL-CIO unions and farmers’ organizations

time has come for the rest of th

these striking workers.

e Union to chip in. and help

ikiik

NE ‘TI-IING Ican assure every member of our Union——
. every dollar spent in Coeur d’Alenes will be wisely used.

I have never been so impressed with the businesslike han-
dling of strike welfare as I have been with the manner in which
it is handled in the Couer d’Alenes. Not a penny is wasted.

One of the things which astounded many trade unionists
and confounded the companies in the past year was the fact
that a Union of our limited resources could sustain a six—months
strike involving thousands of workers.

Fkiik

HERE was no secret then andﬁthere is no secret now in the
Coeur d’Alenes. We are ableto get the greatest mileage

out of every dollar of strike relief because our welfare funds
are handled by rank-and-file members of our Union and dis- Q.
i tributed strictly on the basis of need.

The Coeur d’Alenes strike again points up the need’ for
building up a sizeable International strike fund as quickly as

possible.

Collective bargaining in our industry—like in many others
——is not going to be any easier in the immediate future.‘

ikiki

sizable strike fund is part of our ammunition. in the battle

, , for better wages and working conditions.

The delegates to our coming convention, together with the
ot":fi.cers of the Union, will have to work out a program to see
that dollars are available when our membership needs them.-,-

for enactment of the Forand

for the aged, a minimum
wage of $1.25 an hour, public

there was the feeling that the

FOR THE most part, the

They appeared to act out
pretty much the observation
of New York Times colum-

decisions had been made for
them long before they had a
chance to make up their
minds.

This same lack of any
elation was noted by both the
TV teams of Huntley-Brinkley
and Murrow - Cronkite after
Kennedy’s nomination was
part of the record.

.and Buffalo, N. Y. Local 593,

and the American Brass com-
pany in Torrington.

The talks on wages and pen-
sions, both effective July 1,
became stalled when the com-
pany refused to make any
adequate offer, s e ekin g _ to
take advantage of a tempo-

' rary slackening of work with

a. proposal for a new three-
year agreement with annual
wage increases of 4, 4 and 3
cents per hour and some pen-
sion plan changes.

Both as to content and du-
ration, the offer was flatly re-
jected. The existing contract,
which has not terminated, re-
mains in effect. The pension
agreement, which expired July
1, is being extended. _

Council, headed by coordina-
tor Irving Dichter, and the
company were recessed July
15 after five- days without
agreement on a third year’s
extension of the present con-
tract.

Principal item in dispute
was a new pension plan. The
company’s offer of some
minor improvements in the
present plan did not meet the
Council’s established stand-
ards for pension coverage
which include proposals on
v e s t in g, administration a.nd

the largest turnouts in
years participated June 13
in the annual celebration
here of Miners Union Day,
set apart each year to ob-
serve the birthday of Butte
Miners Union. No. 1.

An estimated crowd of 4,000
helped make the union’s 82nd
anniversary a gala event with
a day full of activities at C0-
lumbia Gardens. The Gardens
was a busy-place from 11 a.m.
until midnight, starting the
program with the annual first
aid contest and ending with a
free dance in the pavilion.

In between, the traditional
Butte miners’ holiday fea-
tured fun and entertainment
for everybody, including a tug
of wa.r, pie-eating contest and

15’ all kinds of sports events for

men, women and children.

Musical entertainment was
provided by the Butte Munici-
pal Band. The well-equipped
picnic grove was put to good
use by scores of family din-
ner parties.

A. month earlier both Gorman
and Meat Cutters President
Thomas J. Lloyd sent a $1,000

opinion, are being prosecuted
very unjustly.”

The second $1,000 contribu-
tion last month followed the
action of the Meat union’s
convention in Atlantic City
where more than 1,200 dele-

gates unanimously approved a ,

resolution condemning “the
principle of the use of ‘con-

THE MINE-MILL union

August. 19-69

HE most comprehensive
job evaluation program
ever done in the non—fer-
rous metals industry was
Completed last month when
representatives of Mine-Mill
and Kennecott: Copper agreed
on classification of the last of

‘some 800 jobs covering over

5,000 workers in four operat-
ing divisions of the Company’s
Western Mining Division.

About 14 jobs, on which
a‘ reement could not be
‘reached, are headed for fur-
ther negotiations and possible
' arbitration.

‘Extra Benefits Gained

Completion of the evaluation
program brought these imme-
diate benefits to Mine-Mill rep-
resented employees in Ken-
necott properties:

1. A substantial wage in-
crease, over and above previ-
ously negotiated increases,
was secured for the vast ma-
jority of workers. The Very
small minority of workers on

jobs that we1'e downgraded.

are guaranteed their present
earnings plus any general
wage increases for as long as
they remain on such jobs.

--2. Substantial progress to-
wards total elimination of the
long-standing Southwest wage
differential through establisl1-
ment of a single, standardized
wage structure for workers in
all four operating divisions.

3. Elimination of numerous
intra-plant inequities th a t,
isarticulai-ly in the Southwest,
were previously based on dis-
criminatory treatment of Mex-
ican-American workers.

The new Kennecott wage
structure also provides a
standard that can be applied
‘in other non-ferrous properties
for the elimination of wage
inequities, including the geo-
graphic differential that still
prevails in most other South-
west operations.

As, of now, even before the
previous differential has been
totally eliminated, workers at
Kennecott’s Chino, New Mex-
ico and Ray, Arizona divisions
are paid rates substantially
above those paid at other
Southwest properties.

‘ Area Differentials Cut

The new evaluated wa-ge
rates became effective in‘ Utah
and Nevada operations on July
._1. In Arizona and New Mex-
ico, where evaluation was

“ "completed before April 15,

the new rates were retroac-
tively applied to the -date on
which workers returned to
Work after last year’s strike.

As of July 1, the pre-exist-
ing geographic differentials
between rates paid in Arizona
and New Mexico and those
paid in Utah and Nevada have
been cut in half; at this rate
these differentials should be
totally eliminated in the next
two years.

installation of job evaluation
at ‘Kennecott’ properties was
the high degree of rank-and
file participation. ‘Local job
evaluation committees at each
property carefully checked out
job descriptions, and negoti-
ated the final wording of each
description and the evaluation
of each job.

Stern Headed Group

Also_, at each step of the
procedure, workers familiar
with the requirements of par-
ticular jobs were called into
the joint discussions for con-
sultation by the :committees.

These local «committees were
assisted at every stage -of the
procedure by a Mine-Mill com-
pany-wide committee "headed

A by" Mine-Millls Research Direc-

tor, Bernard W. ‘Stern. It in-
cluded two regular ‘Kennecott
workers—David "Bennett from
Local 392 of Magna, Utah, and
Mike Marich from Local 124
of Ruth, Nevada.

This company-wide commit-

tee worked with local commit-
tees in making on-the-spot job
studies and in negotiating
classifications. Their W-o rk
helped to insure uniformity in
the application -of the plan.

Representing the company
at each property, in addition
to local industrial engineers
and industrial relations repre-
sentatives, was Clinton P.
Mott, Industrial ‘Eng-inee.r, now
attached to Kennecott’s West-
ern "Mining Divisions.

Conditions Recognized

The high number of wage
gains secured through job
evaluation, in the opinion of
participants, -was -due both to
the careful checking of pro-
posed descriptions and evalu-
ations by local committees, and
also «to the changes which
Mine-Mill succeeded in negoti-
ating into the Company’s orig-
inally proposed plan in las-t
year’s -negotiations.

to this industry. Mine-Mill,
through long months of nego-
tiations, insisted upon and fi-

ances for the -unusual hazards
and disagreeable -conditions of
many jobs in this industry.
Thus, for example, addition-
al points were agreed upon for
frequent use of explosives, for
exposure to high dust concen-
trations, for constant jarring
and jolting in use of heavy
trucks and bulldozers, for ex-
posure to cave-ins and falling
banks, and other like situa-
tions. These additional points,

 

gained in -negotiations, paid
off this year in higher evalua-
tions for many jobs.

   INlI>Us'mv NOTES 

ANACONDA Company’s plea of poverty during the strike
last fall and winter doesn’t sound very convincing in the light
of some remarks to the Utah Securities Dealers Association last
month by Colin W. Raff. Raff, who is financial vice-president
of Montana Power Company was discussing Anaconda, biggest
customer‘ of Montana Power. -

In the last three years, he said, Anaconda had upped ore
production at Butte from 32,900 tons daily to at least 42,500
tons, while cutting employment in copper production in Mon-
tana from 12,500 to 7,500. This and other steps led to savings
in payroll and other costs at the rate o-f $30 million a year.
Raff asserted, “These rather simple facts lead us to the con-
clusion that Anaco-nda’s Montana operation is on the soundest
competitive basis in its entire history.”

LEAD-ZINC subsidy bill was passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives late in June and just missed Senate action before
recess for the national conventions. It will be considered by the
Senate when Congress reconvenes in August. Chances of its
becoming a law are still rated only fair.

The bill would apply only to small producers of not more
than 2,000 tons of zinc and 2,000 tons of lead per year. The
subsidy would be ‘paid whenever the price of zinc was below
141/2 cents per pound or the price of lead was below 17 cents
per pound.

GALENA, one of the three north Idaho mines operated
by American Smelting and Refining.Co., is ‘owned by Callahan
Mining Co., and operated under lease. Callahan gets half the
net profits—its cut last year was $619,000 and would have been
more except that production was stockpiled at the mine for
four months. The other half is split, 1 with ASARCO taking
three-fourths and Day Mines, Inc. taking the rest. Galena is
p-rirnarily a silver producer and in relation to size is one of
the most profitable mines in the Coeur d’Alenes.

CHILE has scheduled a 2% year minerals survey, mainly
in the northern desert. This region is known to be rich in cop-
per, iron, lead, manganese, gold, silver, salts, sulphur, borax and
nitrates. Cost of the project will be over $1.7 million o-f which
the United Nations is contributing $1 million and the Govern-
ment of Chile the rest. Sponsors hope the project will increase-
knowledge of ore deposits and attract cgpita-l for further de-
velopment of Chile’s minerals industry.

- TELLURIUM, one of the so-called “space-age” metals, has
suddenly come into strong demand. In recent years tellurium,
a by-product of lead and copper re-fining, has been used in
curing rubber and as a copper alloy where good machineability
is desired. Now thermo-electricity promises to use large quan-
tities of telluriurn. Thermo-electricity involves direct genera-
tion. of electricity from a heat source, or generation of heat or
cold directly from electric current.

U. S. shipments in 1959 were double 1958 shipments, and
in the past year the price has jumped from $1.65 to $3.50 per-
pound. Trade sources expect further increases up to as much
as $10 per pound.

Biggest producer of te1lu.rium is American Smelting and
Refining Company. Because of lack of big dem-and- until re-
cently, American Smelti.ng’s Baltimore refinery has accumu-
lated tell-urium in the form of a huge sludge pile, which is
valued by metals experts at $15,000,000. Other telluri.u«m pro-
ducers include Anaconda, American Metal Climax, United States-
Smelting, Refining and Mining Company.

BRASS MILL product imports, which reached an all-time
high of 22,999,000 pounds gross weight last December, have
been steadily declining each month since then. , This is-: partly
due to poor demand for brass mill products and partly to price

_ reductions and greater discounts put into effect by American

mills in recent months.

COPPER mine production abroad reached a new high
record of 207,221 tons in- June. Producers’ stocks of copper in
the United States and foreign countries increased by 27,406’

overproduction. Up until June, copper users had been absorb-

CONGO COPPER, Belgian-owned, is illustrated by this massive open pit copper mine at Ruwe, province of

Katanga in the Republic of the Congo, representing an industry which employs more than 20,000 Af- '

ricun workers and produces about 9 percent of the non-Communist world's copper output.

Mining Inferesfs Hold Stake.
In Congo Republic Sifuafion ,

Katanga province, which forms the southern part of the new Republic of Con-

tanga, and no other government nor the United Nations has recognized the inde-

pendence of Katanga.

source of about three-q.;uar-

S. African Profesf

Frightened by a skid of
nearly two billion dollars in
the value of gold and other
South African mining and in-
dustrial’ stocks, two South
African industrial associations
in Capetown have recommend-
ed that the government modi-
fy laws restricting movement
of African labor, and elimina-
tion of separate trade unions-
for white and colored workers.

In a statement to the gov-
ernment, the two associations
argued: “A country of 15 mil-

economic potential while four-
ﬂfths of the population is se-
riously lacking economic op-
portunity.” '

Kenrose strikers demanded

THE PREMIER of Katanga,
Moise Tsh-ombe, is described
by The American Metal Mar-
ket as “pro-Belgian and pro-
mining company.”

This trade journal goes on
to say the problem of transi-

tion to independence in Ka- 1

tanga is “simplified in that
Mr. Tshombe is willing to let

himself be guided——one might.

well say dominated—by the
Union Miniere mining inter-
ests.” His declaration of inde-
pendence “immediately heart-
ened the mining interests and
sparked renewed confidence

in the international copper
markets.”
The Wall ‘Street Journal

says “there’s little doubt some
of the big Belgian mining in-
terests would like to see Ka-

tanga established as a‘sepai;aj;e _

state.”

WHILE THE STATUS of
Katanga awaits clarification,
full production of copper is
being resumed following a
brief interruption in mid-July.

of previous contract talks in

As the strike continues with
the cost financed to date by
