AN ACTIVE DUTY G.|.
AND OTHERS

A JOINT GI-CIVILIAN ACTIVITY

Most Americans want no more of the dirty war in Vietnam. Many G.I.’s, in
Vietnam and stateside, have now joined the anti-war opposition. They don’-t want to
be part of what could be the next quarter-million U.S. casualties in the Vietnam
war, already the longest in American history. If this movement in the services
continues to grow, it could produce the most serious challenge the warmakers have
yet faced.

HUNDREDS OF GI’s, BLACK AND WHITE, ARE PLANNING TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE APRIL 5 MARCH AND RALLY.

This is an act of special courage and an assertion of the G.I. right to free speech in
the face of possible harrassment from the brass.

G.I.’s have a legal right to engage in anti-war activities. Some have helped plan this
demonstration.

JOIN THEM!

THE WAR GOES ON against Black People in the U.S. THE WAR GOES ON against
working people: tax, rent, and cost-of-living increases; legislation to curb the right
to strike and organize; preparation of concentration camps for dissidents;
harrassment of militants and draft resisters. AND THE WAR GOES ON against the
Vietnamese people, maimed and killed by U.S. bombs and ﬁre-power, while the
U.S. and Saigon maneuver in Paris to extract from the NLF and North Vietnam
what the U.S. cannot achieve on the battleﬁeld—victory.

American casualties have risen dramatically since the beginning of the new NLF
offensive. Total casualties exceed 32,000 deaths and 202,000 wounded since Jan. 1,
1961. U.S. threats to renew the bombing of North Vietnam indicate the danger of a
new -escalation in the war. Military setbacks in Vietnam will make the Nixon
administration reconsider their policies, but it will take mass action and mass
pressure by the American people to BRING THE TROOPS HOME ALIVE. ACT
NOW TO END U.S. INTERVENTION IN VIETNAM. JOIN US ON APRIL 5!

WE ARE STILL CONFRONTED BY MILITARIZATION OF THE U.S. AND
RACIAL OPPRESSION!

It is clear that the priorities and values of the Nixon administration—like
Johnson’s—are all wrong!

*Billions to send a man to the moon while widespread hunger continues in many
areas of the U.S.

*Billions for Sentinel anti-ballistic missiles while a broken—down education
al apparatus doesn’t provide children—black or white—with quality education.

*Huge proﬁts for war manufacturers while most black and Spanish-speaking
people must work at low wages in the hardest and most dangerous jobs.

*Recently increased draft quotas—more than 30,000 for March—-are a token of
what the Nixon administration has in store.
Militarization of the country has subordinated human needs to the demands of the
most powerful military machine on earth and deformed the quality of American
life. Colleges have become recruiting grounds for the corporate-military complex;
high schools in poor neighborhoods have )become training centers for a draft army.

IF YOU’RE FED UP
with the war
with racism
with militarization of the U.S.
with war taxes and high prices

JOIN US ON APRIL 5!

      
 

LET NIXON KNOW THAT WE ARE
NOT ANOTH ER SILENT
GENERATION!

END WAR TAXES! FIGHT INFLATKNI
FULL FREEDOM FOR BLACK AND
SPANISH-SPEAKING AMERICANS NOW!
STOP REPRESSION OF

GI AND CIVILIAN DISSENTERS!
