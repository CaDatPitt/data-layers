They say: “Wages make up the labor cost of every article.
It .stands to reason that if wages—or labor costs——go up, the
cost of producing the article must also go up. Therefore,
wage increases must lead to price increases in every industry
in which there is a wage increase.”

Sounds logical, doesn’t it? Especially; if you say it very fast.

But you must say it very,‘ very fast; otherwise the logic goes
into the sewer. «

Let’s try saying it a little more slowly so we can prevent
somebody from picking our pockets while we are. saying it.

Let us assume, just for the sake of argument, that wage
increases do cause price increases.

The ﬁrst thing that must be noted is that an increase in
hourly wage rates does not result in a corresponding increase
in unit labor costs because of increased productivity. Very
large increases in wages may result either in very small in-
creases in unit labor costs or in no increase in ‘labor costs
whatsoever. For example, the Temporary National Economic
Committee showed that in a certain paper company “wage
rates increased 19 per cent between 1936 and 1938, yet be-
cause of a number of improvements in the paper making
machines‘, labor costs per ton of paper increased only 6 per
cent.“ Had still further improvements been made, the labor
cost would not have increased at all. In view of the increase
in productivity during and after the war, it is obvious that
increased hourly rates could not lead to corresponding in-
creases in unit costs. ' '

In the second place, the actual increase in straight'time
hourly earnings has not resulted in a corresponding increase
in hourly labor costs to the employers. During the war, hour-
ly labor costs to employers were higher than hourly straight

it time earnings because of overtime. If a worker got a straight

  

time rate of one dollar an hour during an eight hour day
and worked only eight hours, the hourly labor cost to the
employer was one dollar. But if tl1e.worker put in two extra

8

 

 

hours overtime, he got one dollar and ﬁfty cents for each
of those two hours. This means that it cost the employer
eleven dollars for ten hours work. Thus, the hourly labor
cost was higher than the hourly straight time rate of pay be-
cause of overtime.

VVith the end of'the war, overtime has been almost com-
pletelyleliminated. As a result, even though there has been

an increase in'straight time hourly earnings, the increase in

hourly. labor costs has been much smaller. Straight time

‘ hourly earnings have increased since January, 1945 by 12.7

cents. But, as a result of the elimination of overtime, hourly
labor costs to the employer have increased by only 8.6 cents.“

This increase in hourly labor costs represents an increase of
only 8.2 per cent since January, 1945.7 '

But the increase in the wholesale price of manufactured
goods during this period was 27.9 per cent!3 ‘

Obviously the increased hourly labor cost wasnot respon-
sible for such an increase in prices.

In the third place, labor costs are only a small part of the
production cost of a speciﬁc article. The Federal Trade.Com-
mission, in 1940, studied more than 2,500 companies in 84
different industries and found that wages made up only about
25 per cent of the production cost of the average article.

Therefore, increase in wages do not result in corresponding
increases in production costs. For example, a2 5 per cent in-
crease in wages and salaries would represent only an increase
of one-fourth, or 61/, per cent, in cost of production. If this
increase in production costs were entirely added to the price
of the article, the price should increase by only 61/, per cent
of the cost of production. .

In other words, even according to this argument, very large
wage increases should lead to very small price increases.

But actually, very small wage‘ increases have been accom-
panied by very large price increases.

4. Behold the Snowball! ,

Since the argument about labor costs is so obviously weak,
the corporations have lately attempted to explain the huge
increase in prices by a new version of the labor cost theory.

This “explanation” has been presented by E. A. Evans,

a hired scribbler for the anti-labor Scripps-Howard newspaper
chain as follows: ‘

. Assume that an automobile company’s direct wage-sal-
ary bill—the payroll for its own employees—is one-fourth
of its production costs. A 25 per cent wage increase, if
paid by only that one company among all the hundreds of
thousands of companies, would justify an increase of
only one-fourth of 25 per cent in the price'of its product.

But whether its own product is automobiles or what-
ever, each manufacturing company has to buy the prod-
ucts of many others. And general wage increases, such
as the C.I.O. demands for its unions’ members, increase
the labor costs of all manufacturing companies. . . .

So wage costs become a factor in prices, not once, but
time after time, at each step as the rawest materials—metal
ores underground, for instance—move through the fac-
tories of many manufacturers and become products for
sale to consumers. . . .

V/Vhen wages are raised all along the line, labor costs
snowball at each step. (N. Y. World-Telegram, Jan. 6,
1947)

After this recital, you probably begin to wonder why the

quadrupled since the begin-
ning of.the war!

There is one simple fact which puts a very narrow limit to
how far Mr. Evans’ snowball can roll.

That fact is the followin
ufacturer, for example,
tires, batteries, glass, etc
paid out in all factorie
terials. It does not matt

g: The price which an auto man-
pays for his steel, accessories, parts,
., _includes all the wages which were
s for the manufacture of these ma-
er if the materials used in making an.

10

  

auto came from a thousand different ‘companies and from_ ten
thousand different companies before that and from twenty
thousand companies before that. The fact remains that the
sum total of all wages paid out for the manufacture of these
materials can never be greater than the price which the auto
manufacturer pays for them.

On the contrary, it must at all times be considerably less
than this price. This is obvious. The price of these materials
includes not only their labor costs. It also includes other
costs such as depreciation, taxes, interest, rent, etc. In addi-
tion, it includes the proﬁt which is made by each company
that took part in manufacturing these materials.

But for the sake of argument, let us assume that the entire
price of these materials is made up of the wage costs of pre-
vious states of manufacture. This is a ridiculous assumption,
but we make it in order to see just _how big _Mr. Evans’ snow-
ball can get even under the most fantastic conditions. "

Furthermore, for the sake of argument, let us also assume
that the auto manufacturer has no other costs such as interest,
rent, ‘depreciation, etc. In that case, the labor cost of manu-
facturing an auto would be 1oo per cent of the cost of pro-
duction. A 25 per cent wage increase all the way down the
line would then lead to a maximum increase of 25 per ‘cent
in price. That is as far as the snowball can roll. ‘

Even under these fantastic conditions, it is clear that when
there is a general wage increase in all industries, prices would
never increase more than the percentage increase in wages.

In actual life, since January, 1945 there has been an av-
erage wage increase of only 13.1 per cent.9 Even if 100 per
cent of the cost of production consisted of labor costs, a 13.1
per cent increase in wages could lead only to a 13.1 per cent
increase in prices.

But the actual increase in wholesale prices of manufactured
goods since January, 1945 has been 27.9 per cent!

Obviously even the snowball theory can't explain such a
rise in prices.

11

 

 

It is clear from all this that wage increases do not explain
price increases. Clearly, something else is responsible for price
increases. ‘

As a matter of fact, we admitted that increased labor costs
cause price increases only for the sake of argument. The re-
sult of the argument disproves the argument itself.

5. Wages and Prices Change Independently

Actually wages and prices change independently of each
other.

Look at the facts.

Wages may go up and prices may go down. Take electric
refrigerators. Between 1935 and 1941 wages in the electric
refrigerator industry went up 25 per cent. Despite‘ this the
pride of a standard model electric refrigerator went down in
price in that period from $195 to $172.50.”

Wagesvmay go up and prices may remain the same." Take the

cement industry. Average hourly earnings in the cement in-.
dustry in 1936 were 58 cents, in 1937 they were 66 cents, in V

1938 they were 69 cents.. During those three years average
hourly earnings increased by almost 20 per cent as compared
with 1936. Yet the wholesale price of a barrel of Portland
cement remained ﬁxed during all those three years at $1.67.“
i Wages may remain the same and prices may go down. Take
steel. Wages in the steel industry were practically frozen from
1924 through 1929. In the Pittsburgh district common labor
was paid 44 cents an hour in 1924, and by 1929 the rate was
still 44 cents an hour. Average hourly earnings for all steel
workers were 64 cents in 1924. Six years later, in 1929, they
were 67 cents an hour——a totalof three cents an hour higher
after six years.” Despite this, the composite price of ﬁnished
steel decreased from-$2.61 per 1oo pgunds in 1924 to $2.35
per 100 pounds in 1928.13

12

 

Wages may diﬁer between two plants and yet both may sell
their products for the same price. Take tires. The Goodyear
Tire and Rubber Company sells its tires at the same price
all over the country. But the wages which it pays in its
southern plants are from 15 cents to 50 cents lower than wages
paid for the same work in its northern plants.“ ‘

From this it is clear that wages do not determine prices.
And speciﬁcally, wage increases do not cause price increases.

Does it still sound strange? Then think about it some more.

Those who say that wage increases cause price increases in
reality assume that the manufacturer can raise prices at his
own sweet will. They maintain that when he has to pay higher
wages, he decides to raise his price. i

However, if it were true that a manufacturer could raise
the price of his article whenever he felt like it, then he would
lose nothing if wages were raised. He would simply raise the
price of his article to cover the increase in wages.

But we know that the employer resists every demand for
higher wages. Obviously, this resistance means that he does lose

-something when wages are raised. From what we know about

employers, the loss of» honor, decency and virtue would not
disturb him in the least. There is only one thing whosé loss
would send his blood pressure up—proﬁts. It is because a

’ wage increase results in a cut in proﬁt that the employer re-

sists any wage increase.

Obviously,‘ the employer himself does not believe his own
claptrap about wage increases causing price increases. If he
did, he would not allow strikes to interrupt his pleasant rou-
tine of proﬁt—making. He would grant the wage increases,
jack up the price to make up the dfference and let the proﬁts
come pouring in uninterruptedly.

Neither the small em 10 er in a hi hl com etitive indus-
_ P Y_ _ 8 ‘Y P
try nor the giant monopolist believes in or acts upon the
principle that wage increases cause price increases.

13

 

 

   

 

6. Prices Under Free Competition

What prevents the small employer from raising his price
every time he is compelled to grant a wage increase?

Why, the competition in his industry, of course. Let us as-
sume he increased his price because of a wage increase. But
suppose his ‘competitor kept the price of his article at its
original level. The competitor would sell his goods because
they were cheaper. Our dear employer would be unable to
sell his because‘ they were more expensive. Instead of making
a proﬁt, he would soon go bankrupt. Hence, in order to meet
competition, he must continue selling at the same price de-
spite the fact that he has to pay higher wages. But when he
does this, he gets a lower proﬁt. ‘

Thus, the wage increase does not determine the price. It
affects the proﬁt. Wage increases ‘do not raise prices; they
cut proﬁts. "

Furthermore, if this manufacturer can raise the price of his
product every time he is compelled to raise wages, why must
he wait until he is forced to raise wages? Why doesn’t he
simply raise the price every time he wants to? By doing that
he would pocket the extra proﬁt that came from a‘ higher
price without giving any wage increase. Now, obviously, that
is exactly what he would do—if he could. The fact that he
doesn’t under free competition proves not that he is unwilling.
Whoever heard of a capitalist unwilling to make some extra
proﬁt? It proves that he can’t.

But what about the big fellows, you ask? What about the
huge trusts, monopolies and cartels? They don’t have to worry
about competition in their industries. What is to stop them
from raising prices every time they are compelled to give wage.
increases?

That’s a good clean-cut question.

The only trouble with it is this; If there is no competi-
tion in their industry to stop them from raising prices when
wages are increased then there is also no competition i_n.their

14.

 

 

industry to‘ stop them from raising prices when wages are not
increased.

And, up to a certain point, nothing does stop them.

7. Monopoly Prices

Monopolies and trusts are not decisively inﬂuenced in set-
ting their prices by.wage levels. The main thing that deter-
mines the price of an article produced" by a monopoly is its
opinion about what the trafﬁc will bear. When the Mellon
family sets the price of a pound of aluminum, the most im-
portant question it asks is: ~What price can we get away with?

For example, between 1925 and 1940 the price of a pound
of aluminum ingot was between 20 cents and 27 cents per
pound. But the cost of production including overhead, ma-
chinery, raw materials and labor was between 10 cents and
14 cents per pound. It is small wonder that Fortune Magazine
said: ‘fln the past, the price of aluminum has borne little re-
lation either to the amount sold or to the cost of producing
it."15

Take a look at the highly monopolized steel industry.

Last winter the Steel Union won an 181/2¢ an hour wage
increase.

According to the steel trust, this extra labor cost had to be

‘transferred into the price of steel. Had this been done, the '
- price of steel would have been raised $1 for every 31 that was

paid out in higher wages. But the steel trust demanded and
received from President Truman a price increase of $2 for
every $1 they paid out in higher wages! «

When the steel trust talks about wage increases being re-
sponsible for price increases, that’s really something for the
book. The price policies of the steel trust are well known
for their disregard of every consideration but one—the maxi-
mum proﬁt the traﬂic will bear.

The steel industry is notorious for its famous “break-even
point" price system. According to. this system, the price of a
ton of steel is ﬁxed so that a ‘steel corporation can just break

.4

13

 

even when production is at 40 per cent of capacity. When
production goes up to 45 per cent it begins to make a “nor-

mal” proﬁt. VVhen productionxgoes up to 60 per cent of ca- A

pacity the proﬁt goes above “normal.” When production goes
up to 80 per cent of capacity the proﬁt becomes enormous.
And when production goes up to full capacity, as it did dur-
ing the war, the proﬁts are fabulous.“
What does such a price policy mean?
When a steel plant operates at only 40 per cent of capacity,
the pro rata cost of overhead for the entire plant—including
the 60 per cent that is not working——is included in the price
of every ton of steel that is turned out. Now when more than
40 per cent capacity is used, it means that steel is being turned
out without any additional overhead expenses. Despite this,
the price of a ton of steel remains the same. As a result, on
every additional ton of steel over 40 per cent capacity, the
cost of overhead is being charged twice. Furthermore, the
closer a steel plant comes to operating at capacity, the lower
do its unit labor costs fall. As a result, on every additional

V

ton of steel over 40 per cent of capacity the “labor cost”' is ,

charged 1% times, or 11/2 times or possibly even twice.

If wages determined prices, then the price of a ton of steel
should be reduced whenever a steel plant works at higher
than 40 per cent of capacity. But if you ever see that happen,

then you are a very sick person and better get yourself to a doc-~

tor fast. Anybody that can see that happen is also capable of
seeing pink elephants dancing with maroon.colored butter-
ﬂies.

No matter at what rate a steel plant works the price of a
ton of steel remains ﬁxed despite the fact that the “labor
cost” of a ton of steel falls—as do its other costs of production.
And the steel trust tells us that wages determine prices! That’s
enough to make a horse laugh. _

There are also other price-ﬁxing arrangements whereby the
capitalists in certain industries try to maintain an artiﬁcially

16

high price to offset the eflects of competition. A number of
the most important capitalists who control the bulk of the
output in a certain industry very often come to a written or
unwritten agreement to “peg” the price of their product at a
certain level regardless of the cost of production or" the size
of the demand. This is known as “pegging” the price or
“rigging” the price. A

Wage levels or wage increases are not a decisive element in
ﬁxing price levels or making price changesin a monopolized
industry. That-is one of the reasons why the big capitalists
try to abolish competition among themselves by forming
trusts, combines, holding companies -and cartels. To the ex-
tent that monopolies abolish free competition in a certain
cently, Alcoa had no competition of any kind in the aluminum
industry of the United States. It ruled the roost._

What, then, prevents the monopolists from ﬁxing their
prices at .even more fantastic levels than they are today?

Because they don't have an absolutely clear» ﬁeld to them-
selves.

Look at the Aluminum Corporation of America. This is
as perfect an example of a monpolized industry as was ever
seen since the beginning of the capitalist system. Up until re-
cently, Alcoa had absolutely no competition of any kind in
the aluminum industry of the United States.‘ It ruled the
roost. _ V

But although it had no competition within the aluminum
industry of the United States, it had to compete with other
industries in the United States. For example, it had to com-
pete with the steel industry and the copper industry. If its
price were too high, manufacturers would begin to use steel
or copper or other metals as a substitute. It also had to ‘com-
pete with European aluminum trusts which tried to invade
the American market by underselling the Aluminum Corpora-
tion of America.

Thus, monopoly does not elminate competition. It repro-

b

1/

_,‘ ._. -j

_-._’_a—§:3h-.-,+~.-    

 

 

duces competition on a gigantic scale between monopoly gi-
ants. The aluminum monbpoly competes with steel monop-
olies, copper monopolies, etc. The auto trusts have reduced
competition to the point wherethree giant trusts—the Big

. Three—-virtually control the entire auto industry. But com-

petition within the auto industry has not been completely
eliminated among the Big Three. Also, autos must compete
in the ﬁeld of transportation with the bus and railroad in-
dustry. Coal for heating competes with oil for heating. The
lumber industry competes with the brick and cement indus-
try. All of them must compete with similar monopolies in
the world; market. And so it goes.

Thus, the elimination of free competition within an industry
makes it possible for the monopolists to raise prices with
slight regard for labor costs. But, among other things, the
competition between monopolies in different industries and
on the world market sets certain limits to the level of these
swollen monopoly prices. They are ﬁxed to give the maximum
possible proﬁt taking into account the probable size of the
demand at this price in contrast with the demand at a still
higher price. They are ﬁxed to give the maximum possible
proﬁt taking into account the eflfect at this price of competi-
tion with other monopolies or in the world market in con-
trast to. the effect at a higher price of such competition.

Therefore, an increase in wages is not responsible for an in-
crease‘ in monopoly’ prices. The monopolies raise prices to
“compensate” for wage increases despite the fact that the level
of wages had very little to do with determining the original
price in the ﬁrst place. They do,it because a wage increase

a in a monopolized industry tends to cut down the exorbitant

size of the monopoly proﬁt.

That is why all employers resist wage increases, no matter
whether they are in a competitive industry or a monopolized
industry. They do so not because higher wages are respon-
sible for higher prices but because higher wages reduce proﬁts.

18

 

 

8. What Price Froﬁt?

The real explanation for the dizzy increase in prices since‘
the end of 1939 is to ‘be found not in the wage increases of
the workers but in the mad thirst for proﬁts of the monopolies.

The monopolies have taken advantage of the shortage of
certain products to boost prices up to whatever the traffic will
bear. In cases where there have been no real shortages, the
monopolies have deliberately withheld products from the
market to create a shortage and force through a price increase.

That price increases have been caused by this super—duper
proﬁteering of the monopolies is proven by the proﬁt picture
as revealed in the Nathan report. _ -

.According‘ to this report, corporate proﬁts (after all taxes
were paid) reached ﬁfteen billion dollars for the year 1946. v

' r This is ﬁfty per cent higher than the proﬁts these_ same cor-

porations made at the height of their war-time proﬁteering.

in 1944! And as we all know, war production is usually the ’

most proﬁtable kind of production for the capitalists.

It is seventy-ﬁve’ per cent higher than the proﬁts made dur-
ing 1929! And we all know that ‘1929 was up until now the
most proﬁtable peace-time year in America's. history.

It is two ‘hundred and seventy-ﬁve per cent higher than the
average yearly proﬁt during the years 1936-1939!

If we compare the rate of growth of money, wages and.

proﬁt we ﬁnd *that total corporate proﬁts since 1939 have in-
creased much more rapidly than to'talwages" and salaries. Cor-e

porate income, before taxes, are 290 per cent higher than 1939
while wages and salaries are only 169 per cent higher. Hence .
the relative position of the worker has sharply declined dur—r

ing this period.

The monopolists, taking full advantage of the special con-T

ditions of the country following the end of the war, increased
their rate of proﬁt at the expense of the consumer by deliber-_
ately raising -all prices.

What price proﬁt, friend?

19

« II. WHAT DETERMINES PRICES?

1. Straight From the Horse’s Mouth

We have just seen that wages do not determine prices.

But we still don't know what does determine prices.

Let’s try to ﬁnd out by going to someone who has the
“know-how”—the manufacturer. ‘

We ask Mr. Dough, the bicycle manufacturer: “How is the
price of your bicycle determined?”

He replies: “First I take the cost of my materials such as
tires, steel, machinery, etc. To this I add the cost of hiring
my workers. Then I add my percentage of proﬁt. The sum
total of all three determines the price of my bicycle.”

Quite ‘simple, is it not?

No, it is not. For nothing has been explained.

What we have been told is that the price of the bicycle is
determined by the price of a couple of other things.

Well, what determines the price of a couple of those “other
things,” e.g., the tires?

,. Mr. Dough can’t tell us. He refers us to Mr. Smith who
manufactures the tires for ﬁrst-hand information.

So we ask Mr. Smith, the tire manufacturer: “How is the
price of one of your tires determined?”

He replies: “First I take" the cost of my materials such as
rubber, fabric, machine-ry, chemicals, etc. To this I add the
cost of hiring my workers. Then I add my percentage of
proﬁt. The sum total of all three determines the price of my
rubber tire.”

Now you have the answer, don’t you?

No, you don't. For this also explains nothing. , -

What we have been told again is that the price of the tire
is determined by the price of a couple of other things.

Well, what "determines the price of a couple of these other
things, for example, the fabric?

Mr. Smith can't tell us. He refers us, in turn, to Mr. Jones
who manufactures the fabric.

So we ask Mr.- Jones, the fabric manufacturer: “How is the
price of your fabric determined?”

He replies: “First I take the cost of my materials such as
cotton thread, machinery, etc. To this I add the cost of
hiring my workers. Then I add my percentage of proﬁt. The

‘ sum total of all three determines the price of my cotton fab-

9!

r1c.

But, Mr. Jones, what determines the price of the cotton
thread? i . '

Mr. Jones says: “You’d better ask Mr. Skinﬂint. He man-
ufactures that.”

It gets to be quite monotonous, doesn't it?

‘Mr. Dough refers us to Mr. Smith, who refers us to Mr.
Jones who refers us to Mr. Skinﬂint who no doubt will refer
us to someone else who in turn will refer us to still. another
person and so on indeﬁnitely. We seem never to get anywhere.

The trouble is'that we have been going in a circle. Sup-
pose we try something else-for example, supply and demand.

2. Supply and Demand

We often hear it said that supply and demand determine
prices. 7
if Let's see. In what way do supply and demand inﬂuence
prices? J

When demand is greater than supply, the price rises. When
supply is greater than,demand, the price falls.

21

But the opposite is‘ also true .Prices inﬂuence supply and
demand. When ‘the price goes up, the demand begins to fall
because fewer and fewer people can afford to pay the higher

price. And when the demand begins to fall, the supply be-

gins to fall. Nobody likes to produce what <_:an’t be sold.

On the other hand, when the price goes down, the demand
‘begins to increase because more and more people can afford
to buy atga lower price. And when demand begins to increase,
the supply begins to grow. Everybody likes to produce some-
thing that can be sold. '

So_we have_ the following result: Supply and demand in-

"fluence prices. But prices also inﬂuence supply and demand.
 Once more we ﬁnd ourselves going around in a circle and
getting nowhere fast.

We agree that prices go up when demand is greater than
supply. We also agree that prices go down when supply is
greater than demand.’ But what happens when supply is
equal to demand? Obviously the price doesn’t go up and
neither does it go down. It remains ﬁxed at a certain point.

But what determines the point at which it is ﬁxed?

This is where we came in in the ﬁrst place.

I 3. What Do We Mean By Price? .

Now let's try looking at it this way. _

Just what do we mean when we talk about the price of an
article? '

Suppose the price of a hat is $5 and the price of a pair of
shoes is also 35. If I own a hat, I can sell it for $5. With
this ﬁve dollars I can‘ buy the pair of shoes. In this way I
start out with a hat and wind up with a pair of shoes.

What have I really done? ' ‘

 I have really exchanged the hat for the shoes.

Therefore, when I say that the price of the hat is $5, I
really mean that it can be exchanged for a pair of shoes whose
price is .155. Or else, that it can be exchanged for ﬁve fountain

22

I

 

 

pens whose price is $1 each. Or else that it can be exchanged
for ten watermelons whose price is ﬁfty cents each. Or else,
it-can be exchanged for twenty pounds of potatoes whose price
is a quarter a pound. .

In other words, prices express in terms of money the pro-
portion in which one article may be exchanged for another;
that is, its exchange value.

To ﬁnd out what determines prices, we must first ﬁnd out
what determines this exchange value.

'Let us go back to the hat and the shoes.-

If one hat can be exchanged for one ‘pair of shoes, the
value of the hatlmust be equal to the value of the shoes.

But if their values areequal, they must both have some-
thing in common which can be measured.‘

What is there in common between a hat and a pair of
shoes which can be measured to ﬁnd out if they are equal to
each other in exchange? ‘

They are certainly not equal to each other because of their
weight; a hat is much lighter than a pair of shoes, They are
certainly not equal to each other because of their shape. They
are certainly not equal to each other because. of their size.
They are certainly not equal to each other because of their
color. They are certainly not equal to each other because of
their materials. They are certainly not equal to each other
in the uses to which they are put. In brief, they are not equal
to each other because of any physicalproperty which they may
have.

There is only one feature which they. both have in com-
mon which .can be compared and measured. ,Both of.._them
are the products of human labor. A certain number of hours
of work was required to make the hat. Likewise, »a certain
number of hours of work was required to make the shoes. That
is the only thing they have in common which can be measured
to determine if they are equal to each other‘ in exchange.-

Therefore, the exchange value of an article is determined

23

 

 

 

by the hours of work required under average conditions of
skill and technique to produce that article.

The price of an article merely expresses in terms of money
this exchange value of an article. Therefore, the price of an
article is, in the last analysis determined by the amount of
work which is required to produce it.

It may sound strange to say this today.

But there was a time when it would have been strange to
say anything else.

Centuries ago everybody determined the value of articles
they wanted to swap for others, or to sell for cash, by the
number of hours or days or weeks of work which it took to
produce those articles. They habitually measured the value
of a commodity by the amount of work it took to produce it.

In those days life was so narrow, limited and simple that
everybody knew pretty accurately just how much work some-
one,else had to put in to make or grow something. Most fam-
ilies raised, grew and made pretty nearly all the necessities
of life right on their own farm. They not only grew their
own wheat but also milled that wheat into ﬂour themselves
and baked it into bread in their own oven—which they them-
selves had built. They knew pretty generally how much, work
wasjnvolved, on an average, in making a loaf of bread from
the time the seed was planted to the time the steaming loaf was
pulled from the oven. The same thing held true of clothes.
They grew their own ﬂax, spun the ﬂax into yarn, wove the
yarn into clpth and made their own clothing—-called home-
spun.

Even as far as other crafts were concerned, all worked un-

der the public inspection of everyone else in the small vil-
lages and towns. The village blacksmith could see the v1'1-
lage carriage maker work across the street. The village cab-
inetmaker could see the village candlemaker next door. The
shoemaker, carrying his tools with him, would make periodic
trips to outlying farms where he would make complete pairs

24

 

 

 

of shoes right outside the farmhouse door under the watchful
gaze of the housewife.

Therefore, as a result of long experience the determination
of the value of a commodity according to the amount of work
it took to produce it was a comparatively simple matter. If,
roughly, it took two days to chop down a tree, peel off its
bark, saw the tree into suitable lengths, and make a*dresser;
while roughly, it took eight days to go through the same
process in order to make a wagon, then the price of a wagon
would tend to be four times as high as the price of a dresser.

When a man sold an article, he got gold or silver for it. In
other words, he exchanged his article for a certain amount of
gold or silver. In making this exchange, the only new question
involved was to make a more or less correct estimate of how
much work was required to mine or reﬁne an ounce or a
pound of gold or silver. As far as metal coins were concerned,
a shilling or a crown or a franc was simply the name for so
many ounces of the precious metal contained in the coin.

Sometimes, of course, when the demand was greater than
the supply, the price would rise above the value as deter-
mined by the working time necessary to make the commodity.
Sometimes when the supply was greater than the demand,
the price would fall below its true value. But, in general, the
price ﬂuctuated around that value.

4. Benjamin Franklin and Karl Marx

The first American thinker to study this question and write
about it was the celebrated founding father of our country,
Benjamin Franklin. He wrote in 1721 as follows:

By labor may the value of silver be measured as well as
other things. As suppose one man employed to raise corn
while another is digging and reﬁning silver; at the year’s
end, or at any other period of time, the complete produce
of corn, and that of silver, are the natural price of each
other; and if one be twenty bushels, and the othertwenty

25

 

 

   
    

ounces, then an ounce-of ‘that silver is worth the labor of
raising a bushel of that com. Now, if by the discovery of
some nearer, more easy or plentiful mines, a man may get
fort-y ounces» of silver as easily as formerly he did twenty,
and the same labor is still required to raise twenty bushels
of corn, then two ounces of silver will be worth no more
than the same labor of raising one bushel of corn, and
that bushel of corn will be as cheap at two ounces, as it
was before. at one, ceteris paribus. Thus the riches of a
country are to be valued by the quantity of labor its in-
habitants are able to purchase. . . . Trade, in general being
nothing else but the exchange of labor for labor, the
value of all things is, as I have said before, most justly
measured by labor." ‘

 

In other words, Ben Franklin" said that the value of a
l . bushel of corn was determined by the amount of time a farmer
1 worked toraise it and bring it to market. It took him as much
1 working time, on an average, to raise a bushel of corn as it
1 took a silver miner to dig and reﬁne an ounce of silver. There-
fore, a bushel of corn was worth an ounce of silver. If there
i werean ounce of silver in a British shilling in those days,
I W _ the price of a bushel of corn would be equal to -one shilling.
!i What Benjamin Franklin said in 1721 was the product of
‘E his own direct experience. Franklin was above all a practical
 man. His opinions and ideas were based on a shrewd practical
E , insight into the behavior and activities of people and things,
5 He generalized this practical insight into a theoretical ex-
‘ planation of value and price.
‘A .  Benjamin Franklin's opinions were one of the ﬁrst bril-
7 ti liant expositions of what later became known as the labor
'N ~’ ' theory of value. This theory maintains that the value of com-
 modities is determined by the working time which is neces-
1 ‘ sary for society, on the average, to produce ‘those commodities.
It maintains“ that the price of a commodity is nothing but its
value expressed in terms of money. Therefore, the price of a
\ commodity is, in the last analysis, determined by the working

26

9

 

time which is. necessary, on the average, to produce that com-
modity. - i «

This labor theory of value, which Benjamin Franklin was
one of the first to advance, became one of the cornerstones of
Karl Marx's socialist theories. Of course, Karl Marx put this
theory on a scientiﬁc basis and found the answer to many

questions which Ben Franklin could not solve. But the pioneer-

ing character of Franklin’s observation was an important
contribution to human thought. In fact Karl Marx says the
following about Benjamin Franklin:

The ﬁrst sensible analysis of exchange value as labor-
time, made so clear as to seem almost commonplace, is to
be found in the work of a man of the New World where
the bourgeois relations of production imported together
with their representatives sprouted rapidly in a soil which
made up its lack of historical traditions with a surplus of
humus. That man was Benjamin Franklin, who formu- .
lated the fundamental law of modern political economy
in his first work which he wrote when a mere youth and _
published in 1721.18

What, oh what, wi-ll the Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion say to this! .

As gold and silver began more and more to be used as a
medium of exchange people began to estimate the value of an
article in terms of so many ounces of silver or gold instead of
so many hours or days of work. But actually when they esti-

mated that a bushel of corn was worth an ounce of silver,

they did so because the labor time necessary to produce a
bushel of corn and an ounce of silver was same.

Later still, when governments began to coin money such
as ducats, shillings, francs, golden eagles, etc., people began to
estimate the value of an article in terms of certain coins in-
stead of so many ounces of gold or silver. Theystopped saying
that a bushel of corn was worth an ounce of silver and began

27

i

to say that a bushel of corn was worth a shilling. But actually,
when they estimated that a bushel of corn was worth a shilling,
they did so because there was an ounce of silver in a shilling.
It was merely a different form of saying that a bushel of corn
was worth an ounce of silver.

People stopped thinking in terms of precious metals and
began to think exclusively in terms of prices. They did so not
only because the use of gold and silver gave way to coins and
other forms of money but because it became more and more
diﬂiscult to estimate how much work was involved in produc-
ing certain articles.

Especially in modern times, under highly developed capi-
talism, conditions are vastly different from what they were in
Ben Franklin's day, or the centuries before. Noneof us can
tell from our own direct, everyday experience just how much
working time is involved in the manufacture of even the most
commonplace articles—an auto, or a watch, or a loaf of bread.

Nevertheless, the fact is that today—just as 200 or 500 or
1,000 years ago—the value of a commodity is determined by
the amount of working time it takes to produce it. The law of
value operates behind our backs, so to speak, without our
being consciously aware of it.

It was the great genius of Karl Marx which made it pos-
sible for us to penetrate beneath the complexity of the mod-
ern capitalist system of prices and,to demonstrate that the
basic law of value still operates—the law which states that the
value of an article is determined by the amount of working
time which it took to produce it and that price is simply the
expression of this value in terms of money.

This law operates today for society asga whole as a law of
averages. This means that the average price of articles over
long periods of time is determined by the average amount of
work it takes society as a whole to produce them.

This is why, over long periods of time, over many decades,
the price of all articles tends to fall. The price tends to fall

28 ”

 

 

because productivity continually grows, that is, less and less
‘work is required to produce articles.

But the amount of work which it takes to produce an article
is a very different thing from the amount of money a worker
gets as wages.

So long as it takes.the same amount of work to produce an
article, the value will remain the same, and the price will tend
to remain the same. i __

But that doesn’t stop wages from going up or down.

On the other hand, it may take less work to produce an
article. In that case the value will decline, and the price will
tend to fall. _ g A

But that doesn’t stop wages from going up or down or re-
maining the same.

This explains the facts we presented in the ﬁrst part of
this pamphlet. Those facts. proved that in actual life prices
and wages may change independently of each other. The law
of value explains why this is possible.

The law of value proves that wages do not determine prices _‘

because prices are determined not ‘by wages, but by some-
thing else—by the value of the article. ‘

I11. SHOULD LABOR FIGHT For:
TWAGE INCREASES?

1. The Productivity Wage ; Policy

The corporations say: -

“Don’t ask for wage increases now. ' The only way
to increase real wages is to lower prices by increasing pro—
_ductivity. Help us increase productivity, and you will auto
matically get higher real wages.” . ‘

This is also the wage policy of the reactionary top leader-»
ship of the A. F.‘ of L. ' ~ .

One wouldthink that there had been no increase in _ pro-
ductivity during the past few years and hence that wages can’t
be increased today without increasing prices.

But productivity in all manufacturing industries increased
on an average about 5 per cent per year from 1941 to 1944.

g _ The total increase in productivity during this period was
1 ‘jig per cent, according to the War Production Board. A

  
 

.  .Why haven't we gotten lower prices and, therefore, higher

real wages as a result of this increased productivity?
. \ “The war,” they say, “It’s because this increase in produc-

 

tivity took place in industry producing war materials. In-

t creased productivity in making 30-min. shells or 50-ton tanks

doesn_’t mean anything for wages and prices today. Not many
workers produce them, and certainly the general public

30

 

 

doesn’t buy them. What we have to do is increase productivity
of peace-time industry. War time increases in productivity
can't be passed along to peace-time industry.”

They lie again. More than three-quarters of all production
during the war years 1942, 1943 and 1944 was on products
which are used not only during war but also during peace-
time. About half of all production and construction carried
out 'on war contracts was likewise on products which are
used duringpeace-time such as autos, trucks, radios, gasoline,
etc. The increase in productivity in these. products should
affect wages and prices now. But it doesn’t.

In addition, the war ended more than a year and a half ago.
Has nothing happened since then?

The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that pro-
duction per man rose in 1945 over 1944. The Federal Reserve
/Board declared that in the majority of industries productivity
i shigher than before the war. The U. S. News (October 4,

' 1946), stating that a further and faster rise in productivity is

indicated for 1947, predicted that productivity will rise in the
ﬁrst half of 1947 to a peak about 25 per cent above the 1939
level. The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculated in Janu-
ary, 1946 that productivity by 1950 would be 30 per cent
higher than in 1940. _

Thus productivity increased during the war. It is continuing
to increase today. It will continue to increase in the future.

4 v elf ‘increased productivity automatically results in higher

real wages through lower prices, it should have had that re-
sult already. But it hasn’t.

Obviously, increased productivity doesn’t automatically
lower prices.

Perhaps the trouble is_that we have been discussing war
years. What about a peace-time period?

Let us take the eight year peace-time period between 1922
and 1929. 1

During this period productivity in manufacturing indus-

31

 

tries increased by more than 25 per cent. If productivity auto-
matically results in an increase in real wages through a de-
crease in prices, thereshould have been quite a substantial
increase in real wages during these eight years. Nothing of
the kind happened. Prices as a whole did not go down during
those years. They actually increased somewhat. In 1922 retail
prices were 49 per cent higher than they had been in the years

 

preceding the World War I. In 1929 they were 53 per cent 9

higher. In other words, retail prices in 1929 were ‘higher than
in 1922 despite the fact that productivity had increased.” -

What about money wages during this period? Perhaps the
increased productivity resulted in higher money wages in-
stead of lower prices?

The National Industrial Conference Board, a big business
organization, gives us the answer to that one straight from
the horse's mouth. According to it, the average hourly earn-
ings of workers in 25 different manufacturing industries were
56 cents an hour in 1924. In 1929, they were 59 cents an hour.
In other words, average hourly earnings in these industries
had increased about one-half cents ‘an hour each year for those
six years. This was a ‘total increase over six years of about
5 per cent or less than 1 per cent per year.~2°-

These are the facts.

They make all the corporation doubletalk about increasing
real wages by greater productivity look pretty sick.

What the corporations mean when they ask the worker to
cooperate in raising productivity is to submit voluntarily .to
speed-up. The corporations don't need any cooperation from
workers in raising productivity by introducing new machines
or making technological improvements on existing machines.
Whenever a corporation thinks it will be more proﬁtable to
install a new machine, thus increasing productivity, it does so
without asking for the “cooperation” of the worker.

But there is more than one way of skinning a cat. Output
may also be increased by speeding-up the worker without

32

 

 

introducing any new machines or technical- processes. This

method of increasing output is well-known to all workers and '

hated by them. In its most developed form it is known as the
Taylor system or the Bedaux system. In the textile industry it
is known as the “stretch-out.” Speed-up increases output by

‘burning out the workers. At forty he is ready for the scrap

hea . .

Tphis is the kind of increased output ‘the corporations pre-
fer. They hate to" lose the millions of dollars they have invested
in machinery and equipment by throwing~them on the scrap
heap whenever a newly invented machine renders“ them obso-
lete. They would rather speed up the worker and throw him
on the scrap heap when he is all burned out. Workers are
cheap—machines cost a lot of money.

In fact, it is quite laughable to hear the big trusts and cor-
porations talk about their great love for increased productiv-
ity. They are among the most important forces for hindering
and delaying the introduction of new machinery and processes.
They buy up patents and sit on them for years to prevent any-
body from using them until their own original investment is
paid back. They introduce new machinery and new processes
only when it is more proﬁtable to them no matter how much
this delay prevents any increase in productivity.

As a matter of fact, it is not the high level of technique and
productivity which has produced the boasted “high standard
of living” in the United States compared with other countries.
It is the other way around. Historically, wages were relatively
higher in the United States than in European countries be-
cause if a worker didn't like his wages in the early days he
could pack up and get himself a homestead inlthe West. This
high level of wages and shortage of workers stimulated the
search for and introduction of labor-saving machinery by
American employers. Historically, therefore, it was not pro-
ductivity which led to ‘relatively high wages but these rela-
tively high wages which led to. ever greater productivity. Later

33

on, when it was no longer possible for a worker to pack up
and go out West, it was only as a result of gigantic strike
struggles that these relatively high wages were prevented from
being cut to the same level as in other countries.

What does increased productivity. result in?

Its only inevitable and automatic result is to reduce the
labor cost of each unit produced. If a hand loader in a coal
mine gets ten dollars a day and loads ten tons a day, then the
labor cost of loading a ton of coal is one dollar. If a loader
operating a mechanical loader gets ten dollars aday and loads
twenty tons a day, then the labor cost of loading a ton of coal
is ﬁfty cents a day. The productivity of the loader has doubled.
As a result the labor cost of loading a ton of coal has been cut
by 50 per cent. If the productivity of all categories of miners
—loaders, shot-ﬁrers, motormen, check-weighmen, inspectors,

 

etc.—-was likewise doubled, then the total labor cost‘ of a ton ,

of coal would likewise be reduced by 50 per cent.

That's all that happens automatically. \

After that, it depends-

In a ‘highly competitive industry like bituminous coal min-
ing, increased productivity results in lower prices for coal. A
coal operator who mechanizes his mine gets a bigger proﬁt on
each ton of coal because his labor cost on each ton of coal is
reduced. He can, therefore, reduce his price per ton of coal
below the general market price and continue making the same

.. proﬁtwper ton of coal that other operators make who sell at

the regular market price. In order to keep their customers,
the other operators are also compelled to mechanize their

»mines and reduce their prices.

In a highlymonopolized industry like steel or railroads or
telephones, increased productivity does not result in lower
prices. Take the telephone industry. Enormous increases in
productivity have been made in all branches of the telephone
industry over. the last quarter of a century. But a telephone
call was a nickel twenty-ﬁve years ago. It still costs a nickel

34

 

today. Similarly in the railroad, aluminum and other monopo-

lized industries. The lower labor cost per unit of production

is not passed on in any form—either in lower prices or in
higher wages. It goes into the proﬁt column of the monopolists.
And the fact is that the monopolists already -control the
overwhelming bulk of American industry. The war enor-
mously increased monopoly control over the economic life of
the country. Even less than previously in the history of our
country will increased productivity tend to reﬂect itself in
lower prices. T

9 The worker will not automatically get a bigger piece of

pie merely by baking a bigger pie. Whether the pie is big or
small, his share will be as big as he is strong enough to force
the capitalists to give him. A

2. The Production Wage Policy

“Don’t ask for wage increases. Prices haven't come down

" because despite increased productivity actual production is

not yet hitting on all cylinders. Not enough autos, refrigera-

‘tors and other articles have actually been produced," the cor-

porations say. “Wait till production gets back to full speed.
Then supply and demand will bring prices down, and
your real wages will increase.”

But, as we saw earlier, supply and demand didn't bring
prices down between 1922 and 1929. Every year the supply
increased. Levels of production were surpassed yearafter year
until in 1929 they reached—for that time-—an all-time high.

‘But still prices did not come down. They actually increased

somewhat between 1922 and 1929. Then they did come down
——with a crash that shook the world. Even then, the monopo-
lies prevented prices from going down as far as they should
have by deliberately destroying large supplies of goods. They
dumped oranges into the Paciﬁc Ocean and burned tonsof
coffee to prevent prices from falling still further.

The only trouble was that when prices came tumbling down '

after the crash of 1929 the workers didn't have any wages to

35

 

 

 

buy anything at those low prices. They lost their jobs—17 mil-
lion of them. They stood on street corners selling apples at
the new low price of 5 cents each. They stood on soup lines to
get a free bowl of low-priced soup. They lived in Hoovervilles
made out of low-priced wooden crates. They travelled around
the country looking for jobs in low-priced freight cars.

That’s how our friend, the good old law of supply and de-
mand, may bring prices down again. Already, the war-time
savings of America’s workers have been exhausted. Buying
continues at a fairly high level because sections of the middle
class still have some extra money to spend. When that becomes
exhausted, then the “demand" which is already falling will
fall still further, and the “supply” will crash down on the
heads of the entire country.

Then, those who have the whole “supply” will suddenly
discover that the supply was bigger all along than the demand.
They will discover that their warehouses were stacked all
along with “supply” for which there was no demand. They
will discover that there was an overproduction of everything.

Today they say the trouble is that the demand is bigger
than the supply. Tomorrow, when the crash comes, it will be
seen that the trouble was just the opposite—the supply was
already bigger than the demand. That is why crises take place
regularly under capitalism. They are always crises of relative
overproduction—crises which take place because supplies are
always manufactured without regard to demand and therefore
in excess of demand. .

If prices were automatically regulated by supply and de-
mand, the price of commodities should already be way down.
Inventories——that is, unsold products stacked up in warehouses
and factories—have already reached the all-time high of close to
forty billion dollars. The capitalists themselves are becoming
frightened. But that doesn't stop prices in general from con-
tinuing to increase, even though a few items may decline from
their highest point. Obviously supply and demand can’t be

36

 

 

relied upon to bring prices down and thus increase .real wages.

». 3. Wages and Crises

“Don’t ask us for wage increases because that will result in
a crisis or depression. When wages go up, prices have to go
up. When prices go up, less people can buy goods; Therefore,
manufacturers have to stop producing. They lay workers oif
and a depression starts.”

That’sAwhat the corporations say.

But it’s false.

High wages do not cause crises or depressions.

In the first place, we have seen that wage increases do not
cause price increases. So, if high prices cause a crisis or depres-
sion, high wages are not responsible for it.

In the second place, crises and depressions can and do break
out even when prices are not “high” in the sense we speak of
high prices today. For example, there were no high prices com-
parable in any way to the present during 1935 or 1936.
despite ‘this, a depression took place during the summer 0
1937 which threw millions of workers out of jobs. I

In the third place, high wageseregardless of prices—do not
cause a crisis for any other reason either. Wages were not
especially high during 193 5 or 1936, but the depression of 1937
broke out anyway.

Even more, as we saw earlier from the ﬁgures of the National
Industrial Conference Board, wages remained at practically
the same level between 1924 and 1929. Average «hourly earn-
ings of workers in twenty-ﬁve different manufacturing indus-
tries were 56 cents an hour in 1924 and 59 cents an hour in

-1929. An insigniﬁcant increase. Yet in 1929 the worst crisis

in the history of the world broke out.

Obviously, high wages or wage increases did not cause that
crisis. .

Neither will wage increases be responsible for the crisis
which even capitalist economists admit is inevitable toward
the end of 1947 or the beginning of 1948.

In fact, if wages are not raised, the crisis will come more
quickly. It will be more catastrophic when it does come. And
the workers will suffer more heavily from the ravages of the
crisis if their wages are kept down now and if prices continue
at the present outrageous levels.

In fact, the present low wages are speeding up the outbreak
of the crisis and creating conditionswhich will make the crisis
deeper when it does come.

Criseshave always taken place regularly under capitalism.
The only way to abolish crises is to abolish the cause of crises
—the capitalist system.

An increase in wages will, however, retard the outbreak of
the crisis. It will put workers in a better position to withstand
the ‘worst ravages of the crisis. Therefore, precisely because a
crisis is around the corner,‘ workers must ﬁght harder for wage
increases.

It is clear from everything that has been said that labor must
ﬁght for higher wages. Unless it does, its real wages and there-
fore its standard of living will be constantly reduced even
below the extremely low level at which it is now.

But what policy should guide labor’s ﬁght for higher wages?
This is an extremely important question.

‘_ 4«. The Cost of Living Approach

At the present moment, the labor movement is demanding
wage increases to meet the increased cost of living since Janu-
ary, 1945.

This demand is absolutely correct.

If' labor did not demand such wage increases, it would sig-
nify its willingness to accept a ‘cut in its real wages, that is,

 

in what a worker can actually buy with the money wages he A

gets. If not resisted, the low real wages today would be only
the beginning of continued driving down of real wages. The
working class as a whole would be progressively depressed ever
closer to the level-of paupers.

38

 

But should the wage policy of the labor movement be based
on this cost of living approach?

In our opinion, it should not. Such an approach assumes
that the standard of living as it existed in January, 1945 was
acceptable to labor and that labor is interested only in main-
taining that standard of living.

But the labor movement can never be satisfied with the
standard of living it had inqjanuary, 1945.

The Heller Committee of the University of California
worked out a budget which it considered as a minimum re-
quirement for health and decency. According to this budget,

in 1941, a family of four would have needed $2,042 a year, -

but average earnings of a worker in manufacturing were only
$1,604 a year. In other words, the standard of living of the
average worker in 1941 was below what was required for a
minimum standard of health and decency. »

According to the Heller Committee standards, a family of
four today needs approximately $70 a week to maintain a
minimum health and decency.-'31 V

We see from this that even if the labor movement won wage
increases which would make up for the advance in the cost of
living, it would still be«lower than what is required for a
minimum of decency.

That is why the cost of living approach cannot be the basis
for the wage policy of the labor movement.

But that is exactly what is done by the Trotskyites with
their infamous “escalator clause” wage policy. According to
this escalator clause, the wage standard is determined by what
the cost of living was at a certain date. Then, whenever prices
increase by three per cent wages are adjusted upwards to meet
the increased cost of living. In other words, the standard of
living of the worker would be ﬁxed by contract to a certain
level.

The labor movement must reject such a wage policy. It is
a wage policy which takes for granted that the standard of

39

  

 

living either now or at any time in the past is, or was, a good
one which requires only to be maintained.

The Heller Committee report shows that this is false even-

by. the most conservative estimates of what a decent standard
of living should be. -

5. The Ability-to-Pay Approach

Another incorrect approach is known as the “ability to pay”
wage policy. According to this policy, the labor movement
should make its wage demands on the basis of what the cor-
porations are able to pay. .

Now, in the ﬁrst place, workers can never really determine
what the level of an employer's proﬁt is. The bosses have
become so expert at concealing their proﬁts that the Income
Tax Division of the Treasury Department has to employ a
whole army of lawyers, accountants and detectives to uncover
all the tricks the bosses use to conceal their actual proﬁts in
order to cut down their taxes. And even they can't uncover
all the fraud that is practiced. “

How in the world will the labor movement ever be able to_

determine how much proﬁt a corporatiorrhas made and there-
fore how much it is “able” to pay?
Walter Reuther’s demand that General Motors “open its

books” was based on this “ability to pay” theory. But what-

good would it have done the auto workers if the books had
been opened? There are a thousand ways of concealing proﬁts
that the “books” would never show. ‘

In the second place, a wage policy based on “ability” of -

the employer to "pay would destroy the possibility of maintain-
ing or achieving one of the most important demands of the
trade unions—uniform, industry-wide wage rates.

It is well known that different employers in the same in-
dustry make different rates and amounts of proﬁts. Some em-
ployers, the so-called “marginal employers,” make the lowest
proﬁts.’ Others make higher profits.

40

 

 

According to the “ability to pay” approach, wage rates in
the so-called “marginal” plants would have to be lower than
those in others. Similarly, when wage increases are demanded,
smaller wage raises would have to be demanded from them
than from the others. _ '

But this would result in one of ‘two things:

1) Either it would bring the uniform, industry-wide wage
scale down to the low level which the so-called “marginal”
employers is “able” to pay or,

2) There could not be a uniform, industry-wide wage scale.

In the third place, the “ability to pay” approach means that

- labor accepts the principle that wages should be cut whenever

a certain employer begins to make less proﬁt. It means ac-
ceptance of the principle that labor should voluntarily accept
wage cuts in times of crisis or depression because the employer
makes less proﬁt and, hence, has less “ability” to pay.

In fact, the “ability to pay” approach is traditionally the

approach that the employer has used in his negotiations with
unions because it serves his interests. _The fact that it seems,
at the moment, to strengthen labor’s case for a wage increase
is misleading. If the labor movement should make the'em-
ployer’s “ability to pay” the basis for its wage policy—then the
chickens will come home to roost when the crisis breaks.

What will the labor movement do when the employers use
the “ability to pay” theory a year from now to justify their
demand for wage cuts? If it bases its claim to wage raises now
on “ability to pay,” it is helping pave the way for the em-
ployers to cut wages a year from now. '

6. What Should Guide Labor’s Wage Policy?

One consideration above all must guide the labor move-
ment in its wage struggles. It must at all times aim to secure
an ever-higher standard of living for the mass of workers.

.As we have seen, the present standard of living of the mass
of American workers is below what is required, according to

41

  

the Heller Committee, for a minimum of health and decency.

Hence, the wage demands of the labor movement at the
present time are fully justiﬁed and absolutely necessary if
labor is to move forward to win a higher standard of living
than has existed in the past.

As a matter of fact, even should the present wage demands
of the labor movement be fully won, the resulting standard of
living would still be below that indicated in the Heller Com-
mittee report. - ’

And even if the labor movement won wage increases which
would bring its living standards up to that proposed by the
Heller Committee, that could not be considered’ an upper
limit. What is sacred about the Heller Committee standard
of living? Why should the working class live at a standard
which is based on a minimum of decency? Why should it not
live ‘at a standard which is higher than a minimum for health
and decency?

It should, and it must.

 

The wage policy of the labor movement should be such

that it aims constantly at raising the standard of living of all
workers.

How high should it try to raise it?
As high as it is strong enough to do! ‘

Only the extent of unity and strength of the organized labor
movement, and the strength of the allies it can win to support

its struggles, should determine the wage demands of the labor
movement.

The more highly organized the American workers are, the
closer the ties of labor with the poor farmers, the Negro
people and the city middle classes, the more it will be able
to demand and win.

In conducting its wage struggles, labor must develop a
many—sided approach——direct wage increases, increased mini-
mum wage rates, portal-to-portal pay, abolition of wage rate
inequities within plants, as‘ well as geographic‘ wages differ-

42

 

I

entials. It must ﬁght to establish, wherever possible, the guar-
anteed annual wage.

In conducting its wage struggles, labor must at all times
remember that many factors besides money wages determine
the living standards of the masses. Hence, it must accompany
its direct wage struggles with an organized struggle on the
political front for increasing all forms of ‘social insurance, for
shifting the burden of taxation from the wage earner and the
lower middle class to the wealthy and the corporations, for
measures to curb the monopolies and, among other things, to
expose and break up monopoly price-ﬁxing arrangements. It
must accompany its struggle for wage increases with a deter-
mined effort to eliminate the scandalous north-south wage
differential and, above all, the discrimination against Negro
workers in wage rates. It must accompany its struggles for wage
increases with a determined struggle to shorten the work week
without reduction in pay. .

Only a successful struggle along such lines will enable the
labor movement to advance in the direction of constantly rais-
ing the standard of living of the great mass of workers.

, How high can ‘wages be raised if the labor movement has a
correct wage policy? Can it, by increasing its organization and
ﬁghtingcapacity, raise wages indeﬁnitely?

To answer this question, it is ﬁrst of all necessary to under-
stand what wages are. ~

-V ’ 7. What Are Wages?

When your employer gives you a certain sum of, money
every week as wages, he is really buying something from you.
He buys something from you when he pays you wages just
as he buys something from a dealer when he pays him for raw
materials.

But what do you sell
wages?

Suppose you are a miner. Do you sell coal to your employer

43

your employer in return for your

 

 

 

  
  

in return for your wages? Of course not. If you are an auto
worker, do you sell autos to your employer in return for your

wages? If you are a shoe worker do you sell shoes to your, em- .

ployer in return for your wages? Of course not.
You don’t have any coal or autos or shoes to sell.

There is only one thing which theiminer, the auto worker,
the shoe worker or any other kind of worker has that he can
sell. That one thing is his ability to work.

You sell your ability to work, and, in return, you get your
wages.‘

Y‘o‘ur wages are the price of your ability to work. This price
is determined in the same way that all other prices are deter-
mined——by value.

But what determines the value of your ability to work?
The same thing which determines the value of any other com-
modity—the number of hours of work which it takes to pro-
duce it. i

To produce your ability to work, you must have at least

V enough food, clothing and shelter to keep on living.

Therefore, the wages of the worker are determined first of
all by the value of what he needs physically to keep on living
so he can be able to work. That is the minimumpbelow which
wages cannot fall-at least not permanently.

But wages may be higher than this minimum.

Historical and social conditions play a decisive role in de- ,

termining whether they actually will be higher than this
physical minimum. Historical. conditions in the United States
are such that a relatively higher standard of living was estab-
lished than in other capitalist countries. Inrother words, what
the workers in the United States consider necessary to eat,
wear, live in to be able to work is different than in other coun-
tries. Therefore, the general level of wages is relatively higher
in the United States than in these other countries. But even
in =-the United States historical and social conditions have given

44

 

 

rise to different standards of living in different parts of the
country. This accounts for the differential in wage levels be-
tween north and south over many decades.

What wages actually will be at any period is therefore
determined by the struggle of the trade unions" against
the efforts of employers to lower commonly accepted stand-

_ards of living. But while an ever stronger labor move—

men can raise wages without regard to any “ability” of
the employers to pay, it can raise wages only within certain
limits. These limits are ﬁxed by the nature of the capitalist
system as a proﬁt system. Every increase in wages cuts down
proﬁts. The more wages cut into proﬁts, the more desperately
the capitalist class uses every weapon at its command to keep
wages down and lower them still further. It introduces new
labor-saving machinery which throws workers out of jobs
and creates a permanent army of unemployed. This army of
unemployed workers is then used as a weapon to club the
employed workers into accepting lower wages or not ﬁghting
for higher wages.

Not only that. Periodic economic crises are an inevitable
feature of capitalist society. They occur regularly, indepen-
dently of the will of thecapitalist or worker. They result in
the shutting down of factories, mines, mills and oﬂices for
whole periods of time. Workers are completely thrown out of
their jobslby the millions and thus cut off from the possibility

' ’ of earning‘ any-wages=—high' or low.

Thus, the proﬁt system, by the very nature of its functioning,
puts a limit to the level ,to which wages can be raised even by

the most stubborn organization and struggle. Under capi-

talism, wages can never be raised to the point where they
threaten the actual existence of the capitalist system itself.

Doesthis ‘mean that it is useless for the worker to ﬁght for
higher», wages? Of course not. As Karl Marx said:

. . . the very development of modern industry must
progressively turn the scale in favor of the capitalist

45

:3 i‘

against the working men, and . . . consequently the gen-
eral tendency of capitalistic production is not to raise,
but to sink the average standard of wages, or to push the
value of labor more or less to its miyzimum limit. Such
being the tendency of things in this system, is this to say
that the working class ought to renounce their resistance
against the encroachments of capital and abandon their
attempt at making the best of the occasional chances for
their temporary improvement? If they did, they would be
degraded to one level mass of broken-down wretches past
salvation. I think I have shown that their struggles for the
standard of wages are incidents inseparable from the
whole wages system, that in 99 cases out of 100 their ef-
forts at raising wages are only efforts at maintaining the
given value of labor and that the necessity of debating
their price with the capitalist is inherent to their condi-
tion of having to sell themselves as commodities. By cow-
ardly giving way in their everyday conﬂict with capital,
they would certainly disqualify themselves for the ini-
tiating of any larger movement.”

The labor movement ‘must continually ﬁght for higher
wages. And in this ﬁght it must base its wage policy upon the

. need for continually raising its standard of living to new

heights. Only this perspective, as well as the strength of its
organization _and the support it gets from its friends and allies,
should determine the spec/iﬁc wage demands of the labor
movement. ”

At the same time, the labor movement must begin to under-
stand that its struggle for higher wages and against the efforts
of the capitalists to lower living standards is a struggle which
can be carried on only within certain limits’ and which can
never permanently solve its problems. The fundamental cause
of the poverty, misery and degradation of the great mass of
workers is the capitalist system itself. The labor movement
must begin to -understand that, necessary as the ﬁght for high

1. WAGES Do NOT DETERMINE PRICES

1. Which Went Up First?

The big corporations oppose all demands for higher wages

’ by telling us that wage increases lead to price increases.

But, in spite of their skillful propaganda, the fact is that
higher wages do not cause higher prices. .
This can be shown quite simply.

How do the corporations and trusts try to prove that wage g’

increases cause price increases?‘ They say: “Look at the facts.
Before the war broke out in Europe in September, 1939,
prices were more or less in line with wages. After the war
broke out, especially after Pearl Harbor, wages went up. As
soon as this happened prices began to climb.” _

Now it is true that during the war period both wages and
prices went up. V

But the important question is: Which went up first?

This .is not at all the old question: which-came-ﬁrst—the-
chicken-or-the-egg? _ A '

Suppose wages went up ﬁrst and then prices. In that case
some kind of argument might be made out to “prove” that
prices went up because wages went up. Even so, this would
not be a very strong arument. If one thing happens after some-
thing else, this is no proof that it happened because of some-
thing else. ‘After the rooster awakes and crows in the morn-
ing, the sun begins to rise. Does this mean that the sun rises

' because the rooster wakes up and crows?

The same thing is true of wages and prices during the war.-

5

 

 

V

   

Even if we assume that ﬁrst wages increased and that prices
only went up afterwards, this still would not prove that the
wage increases caused the price increases. Perhaps the prices
went up for a different reason—as they did.

But the actual fact is that wages did not go up before prices.
The opposite happened. First prices began to move up. Only
after this happened, did the trade unions begin to ask for
wage increases.

When the war broke out in Europe in September, 1939,
all workers in the main industries were working on the basis
of wage scales established before the outbreak of the war. ,
These wage scales did not change during the last four -months
of 1939. In spite of this, food prices began to advance from
the very moment the war broke out. There was a slow, steady
climb in food prices during September, October, November
and December, 1939. But no wage increases.

During 1940, food prices continued to move upwards. Still
no wage increases. In the summer of 1940 the prices of all
goods purchased by wage earners started to go higher than
they had been during the years from 1935 to 1939. Still no
increases in wage scales. As a matter of fact, the labor move-
ment was concerned during 1940 not so much with wage

V scales as with the fact that there were still some ten million
unemployed workers. There were no important.wage move-
ments in any important industry in the United States during
1940. Beginning with 1941 the cost of living began to zoom
up.1

4 9 But it was not until the Spring of 1941, a full year and a

~ 4 2. half after prices had begun advancing, that the major trade

5 unions in the mining and steel industries began demanding

wage 1ncreases.

j, Thus the corporations lie when they say that ‘prices went
 up during the war because wages went up. Actually prices
1 moved upwards for a year and a half before the major trade
1  unions got any wage increase. It was because prices had al-

6 -.1

   

ready increased, resulting in an actual wage cut for workers,
that the trade unions began demanding wage increases.»

2. Which Went Up Faster?’

That is how it has been ever since. The ﬁght for higher
wages has been a desperate effort to catch up with the dizzy
spiral of prices.

Let’s lookiat the record. '

‘During 1942, the War Labor Board established the famous
Little Steel Formula. This froze all wages at a level 15 per
cent above that which existed in January, 1941. The only
exceptions were those raises required to eliminate sub-stand-
ard rates of pay and wage differentials as well as those granted
for individual merit and length of service promotions. These
exceptions added up to an additional 5 per cent.2

Thus, during more than four and a half years from Jan-
uary, 1941 to July, 1945, the average manufacturing workers’
basic rate of pay went up by 20 per cent at a maximum.

But during this same period, according to government es-
timates, living costs rose by a total of 40 per centI3

In other words, wages never caught up with prices.

What happened after the war ended?

Living costs increased 16.8 per cent from January, 1945 to L

October, 1946. By the end of 1946, the cost of living was about
20 per cent higher than it was in January, 1945, two years be-
fore. In terms of real wages, that is, what the worker can
actually buy with his wages, this represents a wage cut of
17 per cent.4

Thus the ﬁght for wage increases is, in reality, an attempt
to catch up with the astronomical rise in the cost of living.

3. The Argument About “Labor Costs”

The corporations try to convince us that it is only natural
and logical that wage increases should cause price increases.
