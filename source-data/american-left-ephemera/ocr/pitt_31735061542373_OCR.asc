, In spite of the temporary excitement over Easter demonstrations, the ma—
jor topic of discussion in the Region has been perspectives.= Students are
beginning to seriously re-evaluate their previous conclusions about the peace
movement. T here is a greater realization of the major limitations on a stu-
dent peace group, and a greater disillusionment with demonstration as the best
-method of achieving peace. Students are starting to look for.ways to entrench
the peace movement more firmly into American politics, and to aim the movement
toward the goal of eventual plitical power. More and more peace candidates.are
running in America, and SPU members are taking a greater interest in political
action as one alternative for students interested in.peace.

.s ,As a result of this more perceptive thinking, a need for some kind of con—
ference to examine these questions has been felt by the membership. And so the
;Region is organizing a General Conference at which these questions and many
others will be analyzed. -What is eht effecto of the recent splits in the East-
ern and_western blocs on the peace movement? What forces are active in America
today which effect the Cold War and the peace movement? How can these forces

be changed_or united? How does an organization go about becoming politically
active? What other projects should SPU get involved in besides demonstrations [

* and political.action? And most important, what are the immediate and longs 5
range goals of the Student Peace Union, and how can be best advance these
goals? . é ' 

At the General Conference all of these problems will be discussed, with
; a hope of some sort of synthesis and more definite solution than now exists.
orilmﬂhevconfereer.will,eonsist largely of free discussion among the participants,
with only a few brief presentations before the group. This kind of conference
has not.yet been-tried by_any other region, and the results could have an im-
portant effect ongthe.coming SPU convention. - ... P

The General Conference will take place on Saturday April 27, l965, and a
party will follow it.r Ehe membership will receive a mailing in the near future
with all of the details of the conference.m In the meantime, it is hoped that
this serious analysis and re~evaluation will continue. ' V

DEFEND,ADVANCE1

Also enclosed with this newsletter is a statement passed by the Regional
Council dealing with the attempt of the mpvernmenm to suppress
Hﬁdvance", a New York youth group. Thong? -SPU has basic differences
with Advance, their right to speak must be defended on a clear civil
liberties basis. 7 ~

STUDENT PEACE UNION
STATEMENT ON ADVANCE

The Central Atlantic Region of the Student Peace Union strongly condemns
the recent action of the United States Attorney General in ordering Advance,
a New York youth group, to register as a "Communist front" organization under
the provisions of the Mccarran act. ' '

As civil libertarians, the SPU opposes all suppressions of the right to
advocate and organize freely, wherever those supPtessions take place, whether
in Spain or Hungary, in Russia or the United States. The Mocarran Act, and its
companion, the Smith Act, legalize such suppression in the United States; for
this reason we oppose these acts whether they are used against Communists,
fascists, or democratic forces.

The Attorney General's attack upon Advance is part of the pattern of

‘ "cold war unity" which the government wishes to impose upon the country,

stifling dissent in the process. The aims and actions of the civil rights,
peace, and labor movements are all too often attacked as "Communist-inspired."
The reason for this is clear: these movements, if they are to succeed, must
break with the status quo and with the Administration that maintains it, by
rejecting the call for cold war unity. They can begin this fight now by
realizing and insisting that only if the rights of free speech and a free
press apply to §ll_can those rights survive for any.

We oppose the action of the Attorney General, despite our basic differ?-
ences with Advance. As an example of these differences we note that by the
standards set up by Advance itself in regard to civil liberties, we would not
be called upon to defend their rights. Advance has stated ﬁhat those whose
political beliefs "stand outside the Bill of Rights," such as racists and
fascists, do not deserve its protection and should be suppressed. This cri-
terion is essentially identical to the rationale for the suppression of
Communists, which contends that, since supporters and apologists for anti-
democratic regimes, such as those of Russia, China, and the satellite
countries, are in fact opposed to the principles embodied in the Bill of
Rights, they are not deserving of its protection. We reject such reasoning.
The protection of the Bill of Rights extends to all groups and persons,
whatever beliefs they may espouse.

We insist upon democracy for all, everywhere. We urge all to give
content to this principle by defending the civil liberties of Advance. We
demand that all_groups be included under the Bill of Rights. Further, we
call for the repeal of the Smith Act and the Mocarran Act, and the dissolution
of the Attorney General's list, HUAC, and every other inquisitorial device.
These issues must be publicly discussed. The Administration's policies of

news °°ntr°1 can only serve to hinder and in the end suppress this kind of
discussion. ' ' '

because

We have built missiles, we have tested nuclear bombs, we have dug shelt-
ers. But today, after 15 years of "security through military power," our in-
security remains a frightening reality.

Despite years of negotiations at Geneva, the governments of the United
States and the Soviet Union have still not brought us significantly closer
to a complete and permanent ban on nuclear weapons tests.

This year saw a crisis over Soviet missile bases in Cuba and an American
blockade in response. Mankind found itself placed on the brink of the "un~
thinkable" war. This year war may break out over Berlin, Viet Nam, or some
new area.

we demand

As a first step toward a policy in the REAL interests of huanity a
serious attempt at a negotiated Test Ban Treaty. Unilateral cessation of
testing by either government would do much to eliminate the suspicion and
distrust that currently clouds the Geneva-talks, move us toward nuclear
disarmament, and serve as a sign of encouragement to people all over the j
world who genuinely want an end to the arms race. 3
