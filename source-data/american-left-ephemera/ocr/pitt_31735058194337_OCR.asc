From THE ADVANCE, Official Organ of the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America

The Eastman_ Kodak Co. of Rochester, N. Y.,
has lately received a good deal of publicity in
the pubiic press in connection" with the first
Payments made by the firm on its pension and
insurance plan. The company’; plan is whgi;
they describe as. cooperative. a 50-50 arrange-
ment. under which the ﬁrm matches the.work-
ers contribution, amounting to 8150.000 a year.
Out of these 300,000 the premiums will be paid.
The company made about $17,000,000 in 1926.
and about $20,000,000 in 1927. The proﬁts for
1928 are expected to reach $25,000,000, '1'h¢
ﬁrm's contribution of $150,000 toward the in.
zurance and pension fundrepresents less than
‘$4 of 1% of_ these annual proﬁts. Thiaia rather
then ngibhcity, that the company is getting,
¢°F|SifI¢l'lI_lx that the employers of the men's
clothing industry in Rochester contribute 134%
of the labor payroll toward the Unemployment
Insurance Fund controlled by the Amalgamated.
The returns to the workers from the unem-
ployment fund are not dependent upon a life
time's work for one ﬁrm as is the case of the
¢-'mD|oyees of the Eastman Kodak Co. Roches-
tcr_ cmp_,oyers have started with lV_»%, but in
Chicago where the Unemployment Insurance
Pan has been in operation several years the
employers contribute 3% of the payroll to the
Union's Unemployment Insurance Fund. The
Oﬂranized clothing workers. are not, like the
Eastman Company workers, tied to their job for
life by their insurance. .

If the above were not sufficient proof of the
sham_ protection that Company Unionism, as
practiced by the Eastman.Kodak.Company. and
all the others accords its victims. the following
"Port by the Federated Press discloses the
true nature of this make-believe unionism. The
Eastman Kodak Co. Union is governed byajoint

a letter of recommendation to -another employer,
but who was known to the_’ company as an ac-
tive trade unionist, received. this passport:

Workmanship good, attendance satisfactory,
character poor as he was disturber. He re-
tlfded production and had distorted views on
¢°°n0l|||¢ ¢l_!iestions. The man in question
was an active member of the bona ﬁde Metal
Polishers’ Union. When asked what important
questions_ were considered by the company
union, this man answered: “baseball, bowling,
picnics and banquets. But never at any time,
and I attended nearly all of_the meetings, did
they take up any matter of vital interest to the
worker such as wages and hours of |abor."
Company-made unions are good for the com-
panies who make them, for no one else

Everybody’s health in the department
is failing. Some have lung trouble, some
bronchial, some catarrh. Pratically every-
one suffers from a cold and normal breath-
ing is more or less diﬂicult. The com-

pany replaces the metal that is eaten up

by the acids but
how are we going
to replace our lungs
and health? Most
of us would quit if
we didn't have
wives and children
to support. As it is
we have to stick.

P e r h a p s y o u
think we get high
wages for this
work? Well, all we
get on the mass
production scheme
working in the de-
partment now is
$26.60. and on this
we are supposed to
support ourselves
and our families.
So you see we’re

getting it b o t h
ways. _
I am suffering

from chronic ca-
tarrh and can hard-
ly breath. I would
have left the com-
pany long ago but
I have a wife and
two children to sup-
port that is why I
am still here. I
hope the Kodak
Worker will pub-
lish this letter and
help us ﬁght a-
gainst these co-n-
ditions.

Room.
The conditions de-
scribed in this let-
ter are of such a
nature as to con-
demn any philan-
thropc pretense of
the whole Eastman
Company. Imagine
a company boast-

ing of millions in profits each year per-
mitting workers to labor under condi-
tions that undermine their health and

shorten thei: lives without making any

effort to eliminate them! How can this
company boast of its welfare aim Ior
the workers! This hyprocracy is too
brazen. We workers in the factory must
begin immediately to agitate against the
company’s body-breaking slavery. We
must organize and demand for the work-
ers in the dipping room: 1—SUC'l'lUN
PIPES OVER EVERY TANK T0 DRAW
OFF THE POISONOUS FUMES. 2—A
SIX HOUR DAY AND! A FIVE DAY
WEEK. 3—A FOUR WEEKS VACA-
TION WITH PAY FOR EACH WORK-
ER. These are absolutely essential de-
mands for these workers. The company
whose millions in profits is drawn from
the bodies of these workers should be
compelled to use some of it to insure the
health of these workers who produce all
wealth. The life and health of the worker
demands a Kodak Workers Union.

EASTMAN COMPANY FEARS
WORKERS UNREST!

Raises Standards on Some Polishing Jobs
to Curb Talk of Union

The Eastman bosses, Messers. S_tuber,
Lovejoy, Perry, et al, are showing a
rather unholy eagerness to pacify the
buffers and metal polishers in the Camera
Works. Within the last two or three weeks
the company has been raising the stand-
ards on some of the jobsand Mr. S_tuber
himself has been promising to adiust a
few more.

This goodness by the company seems
rather hard to ‘believe because barely a
month has passed since, r_. Stuber ﬁred
a committee of three w 0 were elected
by the polishers to ask for a readJ_ust-
ment of these same jobs. At that time,
the bosses said the prices would stand
whether the workers liked _it or_ not.
Why then this sudden change in policy?

The fact is the company officials are
beginning to fear the growing volume of
unrest. They _are beginning to feel that
the revolt against the speed-up and slave
driving is reaching into every department
of the factory._ The threatened strike of
the metal polishers, the protest by a

‘committee from the dipping room against

their rotten conditions of work, the re-
sistance to more intense _exploitation by
the girls in the reel guaging department,
and most important of all the existence
of a Communist nucleus in the factory
publishing such a militant organ as The
Kodak Worker which exposes the hypo-
critical bribes by which the e0mD9J'|Y

seeks to quiet the workers, and which is '-

actively working for a Kodak Workers
Union are all symptoms of the growing
disaffection. THE BOSSES ARE BE-
GINNING TO REALIZE THAT ALL
THEIR BRIBES WON T PREVENT
THE FORMATION OF A KODAK
WORKERS UNION. They _are attempt-
ing to stem this rising discontent by
making concessions to those who were
worse hit by the super point system and
are most bitter against the_ﬁrm.. This
explains the sudden change in policy of
the company towards the metal polishers.

But the company is bound to be bitterly
disappointed. The workers have long
ago, particularly the polishers. learned
not to trust the pretty words of the boss-
es. They know that if the company gives

tomorrow. They are learning from hard
experience that only a Kodak Workeis
Union, the real power of the masses oi
kodak workers can force the bosses to
abolish the speed up and bring better
conditions for the workers. That is why
a Kodak Workers Union is bound to come.

MOTHER OF SEVEN ARRESTED

Do you know how to support a family
of six children, ranging from two L0
ﬁfteen_years, paying rent, food, and doc-
tor’s bills, and contributing to charity, on
a salary of $27 a week?

Neither does ,Mrs. Anna Ross Frey,
thirty-seven, No. 1584 Lake Avenue, and
mother of seven, who collapsed while ex-
plaining her family’s predicament today
in city court.

“You see, your honor, Mr. Frey is em-
ployed at the Eastman Kodak Works.
His salary there is $27 a week.

f‘He 1S practically forced to give a cer-
tain amount of his pay to the Community
Chest. After he does that and pays rent
and food and the many doctor bills we
have, we're naturally in debt and can't
get out.

“Last August, things got so bad we
went to the Community Chest for help.
They told us they could do nothing about
our problem because we weren't in the
city a full year at the time.”

(This story appeared on the front page
of the Rochester Journal on Jan. 11.
Imagine this worker paid $27 a week and
expected to bring up a decent American

family! And then vconsi,deI'.the action.—of A

the Community Chest which hides behind
some technicality and refuses to come to
the assistance of the workers! Now every
worker can understand why The Kodak
Worker opposes all contributions by the
workers to this bosses agency. This let-
ter teaches us two things: 1—We can
never expect decent wages unless we or-
ganize and force them on our employers.
2—We can never expect assistance from
a boss controlled relief agency such as the
Community Chest when our wages are in-
sufficient. Only by struggle can we ex-

t pect to better our conditions. Our support

should go to the Workers International
Relief, One Union Square, New York
City, which came to the aid of the Pas-
saic strikers, the new Bedford Workers,
and to every other group of workers
struggling for better conditions. This is
a real workers relief organization. Mem-
bership is $1 a year.)

Corrspondence
Fight slave driving!

Editor, Kodak Worker:

We girls of the Reel Gauging Depart-
ment are catching it again. Ever since
about a year ago, when they forced Mr.

'.’Maynard to quit because he was not

enough of a slave driver to suit them,
they have been after us. Hardly a week
passes but that they have some new idea
to put into operation in our department,
and it's not for the beneﬁt of the girls
either. The latest one is this, they too-k
our gauges away from us and hope to
make us do more work than we did be-
fore. Also they took our premium away
from us which means that we must do

us anything today they will take it away more work for less pay. So far it has not

.3 THE KODAK WORKER

worked so well and the other day Voelkel
called us all away from our work and
gave us a speech. 11 you could have
heard it you would no longer wonder why
we are having such a mild winter. Uf a.l
the hot wind bags he wins the booby
prize. He used a lot of words which
most of us, himself included, probably
didn't know what they meant. This much
he made clear though, that if we didn't
speed up like the devil he would ﬁre
every last one of us if necessary. He
.also made a wise crack ‘about the KODAK
WORKER so you see that even he wor-
ries about what the KODAK WORKER
will say about him if he ﬁres the girls.

It looks very much as though he is
worried over the possibilities of losing
his job now that his fairy godfather, the
late Mr. Ruttan, is no longer here to
shield him. So now he is going to scare
us girls out of our wits and show his
.superiors that he is still an asset to the
company, a valuable slave driver. Right
now we are helpless but some day things
will be different. Some day we girls will
have a Union to protect us and then we
will make Voelkel and his type treat us
like ladies instead of as slaves.

Boses magazine lies again
The following is an excerpt from an
editorial appearing in the January num-

.ber of the Kodak Magazine, dealing with‘,
the wage dividend steal (retirement plah).

“In these columns of the Kodak Magazine,
'lHE MOUTHPIECE OF THE KODAK
WORKERS AND THEIR INTERESTS,
it is appropriate for us to express our
gratitude to the Management for this
lurther manifestation of its conﬁdence
and interest in our welfare as members
of the Kodak organization.”

The bird who scribbled that trash
knows damned well that he is lying_ when
he implies that we, the workers in the
shop, are, or have any reason to _be_grate-
ful to the management for their impos-

ing the retirement plan upon us. He also

is well aware of the fact that the motives
of the Company are not so altruistic as
he would have us believe. _ He knows that
the Management is planning to intensify
the speed up and that this retirement
plan is only another means of tying us to
our jobs so that we will not be in a posi-
tion to resist their plans. He also knows
that we workers are not grateful to the
Management for’ this retirement plan but
that we detest it. I dare say that if we
had been consulted on the proposition it
would have been voted down 100 to 1_ or
worse. As for the Kodak Magazine being
the mouthpiece of the workers and_ their
interests, Baloney. Next they will be
telling us that the Chamber of Commerce
is a Labor Union. The material which you
publish in your paper is a very effective
antidote to the dope with which the
bosses ﬁll the workers’ minds through
their papers, such as the Kodak Maga-
zine. Keep up the good work and I feel
certain that your efforts will be rewarded
with success. —Camera Worker.

Editor, Kodak Worker: _
By reading in the daily papers the
statements of the Eastman Kodak Com-

pany which they make about their re-
tirement plan, one would almost believe
that the thing was brought in with the
approval of the workers in the Kodak
factories. They spread a lot of hokum
about this Kodak Employees Welfare
Association. Every worker in the plant
knows that this is a lot of bunk. What
is this association anyway? What voice
do the workers have in its administra-
tion? None whatever. When it comes to
time for the election of delegates the
crooked politicians could take lessons in
the art of election stealing from the di-
rectors of the Welfare Association. It
works something like this, the foreman
brings you the ballot, tells you that it
must be tuined in in a great hurry and
adds, “of course I don't care who you
vote for but last year so and so repre-
sented our department at the conference
and he or she will probablyibe elected
again anyhow, so you might as well vote
for him.” At the plant conference, where
the representatives of the various build-
ings meet, about the same thing happens.
The result is that the ones elected to
represent us are invariably puppets of
the management. But even if an h nest
sincere worker were elected he wou d be
powerless to do anything because it is
an outright company owned institution.
As you have quite often stated, the work-
ers cannot expect any justice from the
bosses until they drganize and with their
unions compel bosses to treat them justly.
That's why I would say to the workers.
To hell with the “benevolence” of the
bosses, build a Kodak Union and ﬁght for
your rights. —-Kodak Park.

WOMEN IN SOVIET UNION FULLY

PRO} ECTED-

In the Soviet Union all women are
fully taken. care of. In industry she
receives the same pay as the man on
identical jobs, every pregnant woman re-
ceives four months leave with full ‘pay,
two months before and two after child-
birth, and all doctor bills paid by the
state insurance fund. She is also allowed
one hour each day, one half hour in the
morning and a half in the afternoon, with
pay to- nurse her babe during working
hours. Women are not permitted to work
overtime. Every opportunity in the Com-
munist Party, which is the ruling party
in the<Soviet Union, in the Trade Unions.
and in the Government is open to the
workers. Many of them hold leading posi-
tions in all these departments. The First
Workers Republic is the only place where
the health and the welfare of the work-
ing men and women receives ﬁrst con-
sideration.

MORE LETTER, MORE, MORE!

Nearly a hundred letters answered our
challenge to the company. This is far
from satisfactory. .There are 10,000
kodak workers and we expect every
worker to answer. We still insist that
the company lied when it declared its
scheme received support from the
workers. We already have one hundred
letters to prove our challenge and we ex-
pect to have 9,900 more. We print two
letters in this issue and shall print more
in later issues. Address all letters care

We paid Haste’s bills while alive!
Why when he’s dead?

When Mr. James H. Haste, former
manager or Kodak Park, died recently,
the management persuaded us to pay
our respects L0 the dead by closing the
plant Ior half of a day. Many workers,
iiim believers in the “philanthropic”,
"chai"itable” nature of your bosses Ielt
certain that they would be paid for . the
time lost. That they were sadly disrep-
pointed it is needless to relate. When Mr.’
i“i-eeman, member 01 the nrm Hickey
Freeman died a couple of years ago that
ﬁrm closed their plant for a whole day.
'lhere however, the workers were paid
for lost time. Does this indicate that
Hickey Freeman and Co. lov-e their
workers any more than the Eastman Ko-
dak Company does?

Certainiy not. What it does prove how-
ever is that that ﬁrm realized that it
was dealing with Union members who
may resent being laid off just because
one of the bosses happened to die while
the Eastman Company knows that its
workers are still helpless because they
are unorganized.

Moral: BUILD THE KODAK WORK-
ERS UNION.

WE WELCOME ROCHESTER
WORKING WOMEN’S
FEDERATION 

The formation by several working wo-
men's organizations together with some
individual women of the Rochester Work-
ing Women’s Federation is an event of
outstanding achievement for the working
men and women of Rochester.

The number of working women is
steadily growing. There are today in
this country 8% million working women
over the age of ten. The insistance by
ministers, priests, rabbis and others that
Women’s place is in the homes is t<_)mmy-
rot. The bosses talk about the family but
they do not hesitate to break up the
family life of the working class, if prof-
its can grow thereby. Nearly two million
married Women are in industry. Most of
them are compelled to work because of
the insufficient wages of their husbands.

Women are replacing men because they
work for less and are less likely to _or-
ganize. The employers say the working
women need more protection than the
male workers; therefore, they get less

gm.

protection and are subjected to greater -

exploitation than male workers. O

The Working Women’s Feder-_ation,., by
ﬁghting for the protection of the work-
ing women and housewife will better the
conditions of all workers. Their ﬁght _for
laws against night work and overtime
for women, fo-r equal pay for the same
work to men and women, for a four
months subsidy of full wages during,
pregnancy, of allowance with pay for
time to nurse a babe during working
hours, fo-r the organization of the wo-
men into the trade union without facing‘
any discriminations are aims that should
receive every support by the workers,
particularly the women. Every woman
in the Kodak industry should join It.’
