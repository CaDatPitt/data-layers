Let's cut the stalling

By ORVILLE LARSON
Vice President and Coordinator of Bargaining

M INEH-MILL members spoke to the non-ferrous op~

'era’rors last week. They spoke in a loud and clear

voice—-—and their meaning was unmistakable.
Tl’l6‘l'i85°/o national vote for a strike, it neces-

sary. said iust/as plain as day—"'Let's cutout the

stalling and start some real negotiations—or else!"

The companies in this industry have rarely made
any kind of decent offer unless and until they were
convinced that our members meant business. They
got their answer last week and we hope they have
sense enough to read it correctly. -

/' .

V

THERE’S a purpose, of course, behind all this com—
pany stalling. I’ve been in on several meetings with
some of the big companies and it's clear that they're
not just “Waltzing us around” for the exercise.

The pattern is pretty much the same in all opera-
tions. No company has yet made an offer that could be
considered within range of an acceptable settlement-

.—a settlement that begins to meet some of the needs of

our members and is in line with the trend of settlements
in other industries.

“The biggest and most profitable copper companies .7

are deliberately holding back. They’re waiting in hopes

that the_ phony sad songs being sung by the lead-zinc"
operators may influence some local to take a cheap set-

tlement and set an industry pattern.

This strategy, we know, is the same the companies
tried last year? It didn't Work for them then. It'Won’t

work this year.

_ _Copper at highest price

THE COPPER companies don’t dare cry poverty. With i

copper still at the ‘highest price in history and huge
profits rolling in, they know nthey couldn’t get away
with it. , 0

So they’re trying to hide behind the lea-d-zinccom-
panies, or those which deal in several metals. Here, too,
the arguments are phony.

Wall Street, in spite of the groans you hear across
the bargaining table, still thinks there’s a lot of money
to be made on lead and zinc. How else can,We“account for
the fact that since the beginning of this year prices of
stocks of major lead and zinc companies have really
zoomed. Here are just some of the figures: ’

BUTTE, Montana.

THE strike vote. was 2,393
.“yes” and 695 ".‘no.’_’ The com-
pany had used everything esc-
cept dancing girls to try to get
a larger .1 “no” vote. and I was
thinking about this coming
down the stairs of the union
hall. It was a nice summer
night and Neversweatslslm was

sitting on the" steps, puffing’

contentedly on’his pipe.

A “Good vote,” I commented,

“how do you explain it?”
Slim emptied his pipe, stood-

up and dustedloff hislpan-ts.
“Yep,” he yepped, “it was

Tspecially good when you con-

sider how the old Steel gang
was out campaigning against
the strike. But I expected this
vote. I wasn't surprised.”
“Give,” I prodded.
“Well,” he said, ‘-‘a good hunk

‘ of that ‘yes’ vote came from us

contract miners. I guess most
of the contract miners ‘and
their wives felt, like Elizabeth
Ann and me. Let me put it this
way: ' C  - '
“Elizabeth Ann ‘picks up

is our custom, we study the
check carefully before dashing
down to the Safeway store and

ticing on, contract miners in

cause no better ‘con-’.. game
than the contract bonus system

I was ever‘ invented by man.

, “Not that it does much ‘good
to study the check or the stub..
I defy even that guy Einstein
or the clowns’ who wrote the
last ‘incometax law. to solve
the contract bonus’ system here.

puzzling to me was .why Roose-

CHICAGO —— Negotiations by
Local 758 with National Lead
Co. brought a new pension and
life insurance plan fully paid by
the Company. The plan has just
been won, too, in negotiations for
the Indianapolis plant of the
Company represented by Local
632;» (Wage increases of 5c per
hour and other gains were also
won, in both cases.) .

Thispplan is a bargaining ob-
jective set forth in the summer
of 1953 by” the National Lead

Council. It replaces one in which

employees paid $7 ‘to,$9 per
month contributions toward a
contributory pension and life in-
surance plan’. Its main features
are as follows: 1. $3,000 of life in-
surance paid for by the Company.

* 2. Pensions at age 65 of $1.75 per

month for each year’ or service
with a minimum often years
and a maximum of 30 years.
These amounts are in addition to
Social Security. I '
Thus pension benefits will -be
from $17.50 fa; a man with‘ 10

r -'

 

,-x

man with 30 years or more. Every ’
employee will be covered, and:
pension ,.creA,dits will . be retroac.-:;.
tive to the date of the employee?sj
hire at National Lead; " .;

3. Provisions for early retire-
ment; 4. For disability retire-_
ment after fifteen years of seljv-1 "
ice at $3 per month benefit for
each year of‘ service. ‘ —- iv

   

Employees Who. were previous-
ly in the contributory plan .(whi_cli
was optional) will _rece_ive bagk
in a lump sum the amount the’
have paid infor pensions, so that
-an employee who had ‘been: con-
tributing for. ten years, say, will’
"get a cash‘ payment. of $400 
$700 depending on his avera
earnings. _ 

It. is estimated the new plan‘
the equivalent of about 6c,
hour. The achievement of Efthi
plan represents a real demonstrx
tion of the effectiveness -of, _t,

demands of labor.

Canada’s largest trade union Local, Mine-Mill's Local 598 of Sudbury, in joint
negotiations with Local 637 of Port Colborne, so far has shown the greatest advance
in the wage struggle by forcing concessions’ from the International Nickel Company
which already add up to something more than a five-cent ‘package. 4 '

To do this has required the greatest membership mobilization in the union's .
history, plus almost four months of direct bargaining and use" of conciliation

f machinery. .. .

. c -  ’ Deadlocked‘ by the company's refusal to go beyond a fouf and three-quarters cents
-» per hour package in direct bargaining, the Union applied for-coliciliation and ended

up before '~ Conciliation Board at
Ontario's arliament buildings in
Toronto on July 19. Here, after
3four full days of hearings andian

attempt by the -Board Chairman,“

Ontario Supreme Court Justice

 '_  _W. D. Roach, to induce continua-
‘ 7 " tion of bargaining, the company
0 was forced to move an additional.

. three-quarters of a cent, but
again the bargaining stalled and
' a recess was palled until August
- 9, when the dparties Will m,eet

Early in the 1954 bargaining
round with Inco, the company at-
tempted to halt concessions after
a proposal that would have added
up to". a one-cent package for
some 16,000 employees who had

J.

amassed for Inco the huge”profits_

 of over $53 millions for the year
0 ’1953.—— V "
Employee reaction to this pro-
‘posal resulted ..in spontaneous
I ,-work stoppages at several of the
;.  companysmines, and at further
bargaining meetings the company
found it expedient to make fur-
L - t tlfer moves. 4
tMEANWHILE, a small group

-.  1 5 of First-Aid men employed by

 . the company and organized into
 -Local 598 as a separate unit had
been in negotiations for some 11

  months without making headway.

t A-Having gone ‘through the, full
' _ conciliation proceedings as re-

uired by the Ontario Labor Act,

1: s ‘group finally voted to take
‘ strike action on July 5. ,,

‘In order to assure these men .
the "fullest support, the big unit

in/Local 598 and‘ Local, 637-
some 16,000 men—-algreed at over-
f1ow- meetings that they would

» terminate their agreement the
same day and. would\respect the

‘*7  picket lines put up by the First

Aid _men. f c N «
Following this, Inco “put th
pressure”. on these few First Aid
\ men and with the assistance of a
self.-admitted supporter of the
company within this First’ Aid
unit, succeeded in getting a ma-
jority of the First Aid imen to
sign petitions repudiating their
"vote to take strike action.

Faced with this s/ituation the

V A . SUDBURY, Ont.-—Th_e 1954 wage increase battle in Canada faced heavy opposi-
tion as industry thus far has made its determination-to give little or no ground to the

proposed strike and the ‘main
group in Local 598 extended their
agreement with Inco until" full
conciliation proceedings were con-
cluded or a new contract {was
reached "with the company.

"Support from Ford local

While the Mine-Mill-Inco nego-

tiations were going on, the big
UAW Ford Local 200 at ’,Wind-
sor, Ont., was in the midst of its
own bargainin and close contact
was maintained between the two
unions. Full information on the
progress of bargaining was ex-
changed and mutual consul@-
tions took place.
° When -Local 598 called for a
special membership meeting to be
held on Monday, July 5, should
the anticipated strike of the First
Aid men take place that ‘day,
Charles McDonald, president of
UAW Local 200, was invited to
Sudbury to address the Mine-Mill
workers. Unable to attend, Mc-
Donald sent the following tele-
gram: '

“Regret responsibilities ll ere
make it impossible for myself or
"members of the negotiating com-
mittee. to be in Sudbury July 5th.
Meetings pending with company
make it imperative that were-
main at home. May I express on
behalf ' of the members of Local
200 our beslx wishes for a "suc-
cessful conclusion in your con-
tract negotiations with Inco.

highest point in the history of

meeting 'of an estimated 10,000
workers met at the Union Hall
and blocked off the entire street
outside the hall to hear a report
on the latest developments in-
cluding the calling off of the
First Aid strike. McDonald's tel-
egram to Local 598 was metiwith
great acclaim by the hugefgath-

h ere, International President
John Clark told his audience:
“Thlsis the best organized strike

theyare both run by Consolidated
