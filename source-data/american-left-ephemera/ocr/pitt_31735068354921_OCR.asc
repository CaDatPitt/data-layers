 Robeson lheld atU.  border,  

speaks to rally by telephone

VANCOUVER, B. C.—High spot of
the Mine-Mill Canadian Conference here
‘was a mass meeting in big Denman
Auditorium, Vvliichwas addressed via

. telephone by the famous Negro bari-

tone, Paul Robeson, from «Seattle,

I I V Washington. I C
The meeting, which had been planned

as an enlarged session of the Mine-Mill
conference at which Robeson was to
sing and attorney Vincent Hallman
was to speak, was turned into a protest
‘rally when U. S. State Department of-
ficials turned. both‘ Robeson and Halli-

, nan back at the border.

Canadian immigration officials had
announced that so far as they were
concerned, neither Robeson Or Halli-

nan would be denied permission to.

‘come to Vancouver. As a result, the
U. S. Department of State fell back On
a wartime law passed by Congress in
1918 and used only once before to pre-

A vent an American citizen from leaving

the country, to block RobesOn’s‘ move-

~~ .. ment.

ROBESON told reporters that the
action ‘of the U. S. Sate Department,
in effect, placed him “under, domestic
arrest” even though “I have never been
brought to court, nor have I been
warned.” He pointed out that he had
“travelled in England and on the conti-
-nent. and, havene/ver before been re-
fused access to any country.” i
 Speakers at‘ the protest meeting, {it-
tended by_mOré than 2000 Vancouver
trade unionists, included John- Cam-
eron, B. C. district board member of

Workers union; Nels Thibault, Mine-
Mill executive board member_ for dis-
trict 8; Harvey Murphy, Mine-Mill re-
gional director and. B. C.;~Ken Smith,
president ‘of the MMSW B. C. district

I  .
      " BA RGAINING ROUN our    
liam Stewart,‘ secretary of the Marine ' a . a a.

’ union; "and C. D. Jackson, vice presi-

dent of UE in eastern Canada.
’ The audience gave Robeson a stand-

_ ing ovation, following his telephone

“appearance,” amplified by loudspeak-
_er. He began by singing “Joe Hill,” and

’ “ then talked briefly, commenting that’

.“We have a tremendous opportunity,

up _ by standing firm, to make a different

world for our children. It won’t be long
—-I’ll be with you very soon.”

Murphy, who acted as chairman, an-
nounced that Robeson had promised’ to
fly to the Canadian border “no matter

<-

where- he" is in the United States” to _

ruin stalls on      

iwo M-M i-ioouooo

‘Two’ representation elections sought

' by Mine-Mill in Arizona mining camps

are being delayed endlessly by the_Na-
tional Labor Relations Board. One is
at Morenci, where some 500 craft
workers are ready to leave the AFL
andjoin the one big, militant union at
this Phelps-Dodge property——Morenci
Miners UniOfI'~,‘Local 616. v . v
The other is at Ray-Sonora. Several
AFL crafts have petitioned there, and
Mine-Mill is seeking to establish one
bargaining ‘unit for these 600 kenne-
cott workers. ’

In both places it is clear that Mine-
Mill has a huge majority. In both
places, the" AFL officials are anxious
to stall, hoping something will change
in their favor. Maybe a new red-bait-

«. ing angle. .Maybe just disgust Over

long delays. _

11’ IS WELL KNOWN to the work-‘
ersin both camps that Mine-Mill is
pressing for elections,‘ and the AFL
‘does not want elections now. They are
drawing conclusions about the “impar-

‘ tiality” of the NLRB.

_The Ray-Sonora campaign is being
led by Int’l.reps. Arthur Flores, How-
ard Mooney and E. S. Conerly. At a
mass meeting Feb. 3, a large crowd
heard messages of support from speak-
ers representing Local 392, Magna,
Utah; Bayard, N. M., Local 890; Mi-
ami, Ariz., Local 586; and Hayden,
Ariz., Local 886. The Magna and Bay-
ard speakers were from locals that also

bargain with Kennecott. Regional Di-

rector Al Skinner of Utah and Morris
Wright of the Press and Education De-
partment have been in Ray-Sonora to

help in ‘ the campaign.

sing for a mass meeting of Canadians
and Americans at the “peaceiarch” at
Blaine whenever it can be arranged in
the spring.

The meeting reaffirmed a resolution,

passed earlier in the day by the dele-
gates to the Mine-Mill Conference, de-
claring that the “U. S. Department Of
State has chosen" to censor what the

Canadian people shall hear and whom '

they shall see.”

“While there has been mounting evi-
dence for several years that the chiefs
of the , U. S. government look. upon
Canada as a part of their colonial em-
pire,” it said, “this is the first sign
that ‘they are prepared to institute an
American-style system of ‘thought con-
,trol’ in Canada.” I , ,

The resolution urged “that citizens
of both countriesfespecially those be-
longing to the trade union ‘movement,
protest to the Canadian Minister of
External Affairs and the U. S. Secre-
tary Of State against this action.”

Meantime, officers of the Intl Long-
shOremen’s & Warehousemen’s union in
San Francisco, charged that the border
halting of Robeson and Hallinan means
“the United Statesof America has be-
come a prison for any ofits citizens

r who. possess ideas that do not meet

with the approval of the State Depart-
ment.” .

“Smith called attention to the suc-

Sloan formula for union security in
‘C.M.&S. The convention endorsed a
resolution’ to press for inclusion of

Delegates also approved a resolution

calling upon all locals to set up political.

action committees, and demanded an
increase in family allowances as well as
extension, of the age limit to cover all
children still dependent‘ on their famil-
ies for support. _

THE CONVENTION agreed unani-

mously on the “necessity for repeal” of A

the 3 per cent sales tax recently im-
posed by the B. C. government. It con-
demned the release by the Canadian
government of S. S. Brigadefeuhrer
Kurt Meyer, responsible for the deliber-
ate massmurder of Canadian soldiers
during the war, and demanded that he
‘be returned to Canada.

A Calling attention to the fact that
there will soon be an election to the
B. C. provincial’ legislature, the con-
vention urged that every local “serious-

‘ ly consider, on thebasis of a vote of

the membership, to place a candidate in
the field, regardless of political affili-

‘ ationS,eif he accepts the programme of

Mine-Mill to run

Special attention was placed on the
need for encouraging and developing
Women’s Auxiliaries in the District.
Among the delegates to the convention
were Mrs. Marie Walsh of the Trail
Auxiliary and Mrs. Margaret'Fitzpat-

as a Mine-Mill can-

rick of Rossland. Both played an ac- _
_ tive part throughout the’ meeting.

analysis by the "Ce sus Bureau shows
that “in 1949 the top’ 20% of the na-

Ir AROYA, PERU 1S the Cerro De Pasco
Cnopper Corporation smelter.
Cerro De Pasco Copper Corporation has on

its Board of Directors many eminently’

respectable gentlemen. Take, for instance,
William A. (M. Burden, formerly Assistant

V Secretary of Commerce and ’"al’so a directorof

American Metal. Company and the Central
Hanover Bank to mention just a few. He
belongs to ten of the swankiest ‘rich. men’s
clubs ranginglfrom the Somerset Club in Bos-
ton down to the Chevy Chase Club in-Wash-
ington. In these clubs a man can relax in
considerable comfort.‘

It is not quite as comfortable in the ore
crushing and grinding department at Aroya.

“Some of these ores "contained as
much as 75 per cent total silica.’ There
was absolutely no attempt made to con-
‘trol dust on such operations as dumping,
crushing, grinding and mechanical con-
veying so that clouds ‘of dust given off
polluted the entire plant. Although most
workers were supplied with respirators
and wore them, not a single respirator
was an approved type.”

‘This information comes- from a survey of‘

the United States Public’ Health Service on
Industrial Hygiene Problems in B0livia,.Peru
and Chile in 1948, pages 34-35. Although the
study does not name it we know it is the Cerro
Del Pasco Smelter at Aroya, Peru, because the
study identifies it as “the largest andonly
smelter in Peru . . _. This smelter employed
approximately 3,000 persons and produced
some twelvedifferent products, including cop-
per, lead and silver.” ‘(Page 34) , '
. ’ Norwas ittcomfortable in the foundry:
0 }“ .  Housekeeping in this shop was
bad. On dusty operations, the men were
cloth‘ bag-respirators. Sand blasting was
done outside the building but with no
control. ’Therejw'as a. definite potential
silicosishazard inthis shop.” (Page_3./l)

It is not quite as good, and it is not safe
at all to work in Aroya. .-In the steel fabricating

thus exposing welders

 Congressmen attack M arsliqll Plan

Three congressmen, just back from
a tour of the globe, ‘have now made a
sharp attack. on the Marshall Plan.
Their comment--that Marshall Plan

aid is “making the rich richer and the «

poor poorer”—was exactly the same’ ‘

as that made several weeks ago by Ja-

cob Potofsky, president of the Amalga-

mated Clothing .Workers, CIO. 
The congressmen are Rep. Bonnier

”(Dein., N. C.); Dorn (Dem. S. Car.);,

and Brownson (Rep. Ind.) They agreed
that political graft and corruption has
skimmed off the "cream of American
assistance at the top, leyels. Summing
up for the delegation,_Brownson said:
“Never have so many“ spent so much
for so few.” ’ A ,
\'_I‘hey blamed monopolies and cartels
for Europe’s shaky economic structures A
and its ability to make fiscal reforms.

SUDBURY, Ont.—Members of the
newly-elected executive board of Mine-

" Mill Auxiliary Local 117 were installed .

last month. Theyincluded: June Liska,‘
president; Anne Andrew, vice presi-
dent; Isobel Smaller, recording secre-
tary; Elizabeth Gunter, financial
secretary’; Florence Clarke, parliamen-
tarian; Lily Johnson, warden; Sophie

trustees. A

Also ‘installed were the officers of

the Coniston sub-local, including Rose

Laporte, vice president, Donna Hugli,

recording secretary and Theresa Battie-
zutti, treasurer.

The annual Charter Night dance,
sponsored by Local 117, is scheduled
for February 13, with plans calling‘
for novelty dances, floor prizes and a
surprise Valentine drawing.

AS USUAL, the local has been active
on a ‘number of fronts in recent Azveeks.
It contributed $25 to help the Torbrit
miners win their strike. Its members
acted as -scrutineers on behalf of the
“union sponsored candidates” in the
December civil elections.’ ,

The Auxiliary also ‘sponsored the an-
nual Christmas Tree party in Decem-
ber, and sent 22 parcels to sanitoriums
throughout the provinces of Quebec,
Manitoba and Ontario, as well as two
large boxesiof/_ goodies «to the plastic
surgery ward in Sunnybrooke hospital.

Old age pensioners’ of Sudbury and

’ the ‘district received Christmas gift .

parcels from the Auxiliary also.

A lengthy annual report, presented
‘by President June Liska, onithe Aux-
iliary local’s activities for 1951, showed
a tremendous record of‘ ‘accomplish-
ment in many fields, including strike

relief, political action and legislation, .

education, entertainment and recrea-
tion, community service, health and ,
housing. ’ ‘ ‘ V

Meantime, the New YorkiTimes pub-
lished the results of “asurvey “among

up with conclusions exactly the same
as those of the three A congressmen,

._The  president of the American
“oolen Co., industry pace-setter. which
boostedjts profits 561 per cent. in the
first. 9} months of 1951, has spelled out
 brutal terms the industry’s plan“ to
awe t textile labor. -
 Ilmerican Woolen president Fran-
cis .;W. White said: “We have every
Tintention ;of ‘removing a , great deal
more of our machinery from this (Law-
_ rence, Mass.) area. Whether any of it
vr'i-williremain -here depends entirely on

be undertaken except after a showing
that such ‘encroachments are vitally
necessary to our national safety. We

do not believe any such, showing has’

been made.”

“We believe,” Murray continued,
»“that if the government undertakes to

determine what unions can represent .

workers in this country it will have
embarked upon the long trail toward
government control of _unions. In the
dictatorships of the world, unions
exist at the sufferance of the state.
We in Amlerica do not want to take
a single step in that direction.”
Murray pointed out that the g'€>vern-
nient already has sufficient powers to
protect ‘itself from any “subversive
workers” and that the Defense Depart-
ment now is exercising its power to

‘screen workerseand keep them isolated»

‘ from secret information.

The reason for such legislation as
Humphrey prgposes, Murray said, must
be the thought that workers might
strike “not to rectify their just griev-
ances” but for political purposes. “But

there has been no evidence of a ‘single A

such stoppage despite a year ‘and a
half of war in Korea and an even long-
er period of cold war,” Murray wrote.
‘ The CIO leader pointed out that
restrictive legislation along, this line
already has failed. ‘

The AFL’s statement came after;
Humphrey made clear he wants to stif-
fen the Taft-Hartley law against labor.

Meantime, Washington columnist Ed-

ing with politicians in Congress to put

zona Daily Star of Tucson, Arizona.
" Here are some key excerpts of the edi-
torial, which warns that we may he
shouted into a war if we remain silent:

“The important fact to be "borne in.

mind about the‘ $85,-000,000,000 budget
that the President has submitted to
Congress is the precedent it sets at a-
critical time in our nation’s history.
“If adopted, it will ‘mark the renewal
of wartime deficit financing, because
' Congress does not dare increase taxes,
but more than anything else it repre-
sents a triumph for the war hawks,
those --~semi-hysterical persons who for
more than a year have'_b‘een going to
extremes in scaring the American peo-
ple' into approving an extreme program
of rearmament . . . . -

“‘THE MOST DANGEROUS part.

about this. program is S‘ that it is sup.-
posed to reach a peak in 1954, .after
which we are told expenditures can be
I reduced. That is an unwarranted hope.

Instead of planning to develop a- mili-

tary policy, whichr is needed, that we
must maintain indefinitely, one» that
we can live with and still maintain our
' free" society, the new ‘budget sets a
precedent that will .see larger and
larger budgets in thepfuture. It will see
more and more deficit financing, and

“If we, the people, don’t get busy
