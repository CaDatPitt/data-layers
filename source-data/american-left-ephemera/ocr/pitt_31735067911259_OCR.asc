Overflow Idaho meeting
demands joint bargaining

KELLOGG, Idaho—Over 2,500
miners, millmen and smeltermen
gathered at the Kellogg Ball Park
July 20 in responserto a call from
the Wallace and Kellogg Mine-
Millllocals to hear and discuss
the reports of the District Nego-
tiating Committee.

Only a handful went to work at each
of the Bunker Hill properties, and most/
of those were manning jobs essential
to maintenance of the properties. '

The workers heard reports by the
District Negotiating Committee and
representatives from the Northwest,
Bargaining Council just back from the
Denver Wage Policy Committee ses-
sions. They also heard an address by
International president John Clark.

, Thenthey adopted a policy statement.

from the Denver conference, makingyit
clear that Locals 14 and 18 will join
other basicsections of the mining and
smelting _industry —in conducting a
strike vote, should it become necessary.

PRESIDENT CLARK declared that
“attempts to freeze w5rker’s wages in
our industry will be fought with the
united might of the miners and smelter-
men because workers in this industry
contribute more to the needs of our
national economy than do any other
group in any_other industry.”

“In making this con‘tribution,”~ he
said, '‘‘miners and smeltermen risk their

.lives, thgir limbs and their health every
minute when they dig and process the , -'

non-ferrous metals that keep our coun-
try, going, and ' it’s about time -the
American people gave us the considera
tion that weiare due.” - L
“We reject -any and all wage freezes
that\are designed to freeze our wages}
to "a 10 per cent— formula while the‘
operators getﬁprices for_zinc 92 per
cent higher than a year. ago.” '

‘In a stirring demonstration of unity
wand determination, the’ members unan-

imously adopted this resolution: '_
AWhereas,' our union has attempted
to open bargaining with the District‘

‘ _ Operators forlalmost three months, and

.Whereas, the operators have stalled

VCARTERET, N. J.——“When do

, wenpull the pin?” That was the

.sentiment of the rank and file

leadership _cg_nference held here

July 20 by Mine-Mill locals in the
New York-New Jersey area. '

" Called by District 6 executive
. board member Albert Pezzati,
 ‘ the conference’s main purpose was to
‘ consider coordinated action with the

’ rest of the union throughout the coun-

try for cracking the industry’s stall on
wage and other contract demands in
current bargaining.

. Approximately fifty local officers. at--.
tended. It was held in the headquarters

' of Carteret Smelter & Refinery Work-

ers Local 837.

THE FEELING of the local rank
and file leaders was unanimous on at
least three major points. First, anger
at the industry’s operators for failure
to bargain seriously and in good faith;
second, justification of the Mine-Mill
bargaining demands on the basis’ of
the obvious economic_facts of life, both,
in relation to living standards and
company profits; third, determination

,to exercise the greatest amount of‘

unity and discipline in action to achieve
' _ the union’s bargaining objectives this
year. -I

To this end, the conference in grim
seriousness voted full approval and
support for the International Union’s
“’ industry-wide bargaining policy and

strategy adopted by the recent bar-
ﬁgaining council and National Wage
,‘l Policy Committee meetings in Denver.

— The local leaders unanimously adoped
“' the national recommendation for au-
thorization of the International Execu-
tive_Board to call strike ‘votes through-
 out/the industry at its di cretion. Simi-

" ;TLos ANGELES, Calif. — Western
'7 "Mechanics Union Local 700 is taking
he leadership in a campaign ‘against a
'. proposed city ordinance that would let

the police chief censor the contents of
= all handbills.,..

B The ordinance was demanded by
‘police chief William Parker, former

sure-to be patterned after an ordinance
-. in suburban Burbank, where three

 “TO CRACK INDUSTRY STALL

each local is to be forthcoming, as the .

membership mobilizes for any fight
that may be necessary:

The general pattern of reluctance on
the part of the companies to show any
real desire for reaching adequate con-
tract settlements was made sharply
evident in reports by the local officers,
at least one of whom from each local

reported to the conference on develop- a

ments in negotiatiohs at his own plant.

The report by Pezzati on the recent
council, policy committe'e ‘and Board
meetings‘ in Denver_ showed clearly

that the pattern of company stalling
in this area [dove-tails exactly with that
in the entire industry throughout the
country. All the more reason, he
pointed out, why the entire member-
ship must be mobilized with more
unity panddiscipline than ever before in
the coordinated fight for higher wages
and improved contracts.

AND BETTER THAN EVER before,
Pezzati said, is the union this year in
the strongest position to carry the fight
through.

' Confinrling the rank and file’s well-
earned confidence’ in the united
strength of the union as it has just

emerged from complete victory over,

any and all raiders in the last couple
of months, the local leaders here are
looking "even beyond the current wage
and contract fight. The conference rec-
ommended a‘program for winning back
seceded or raided locals, and for or-
ganizing new locals at unorganized
plants in tliearea. '

conference were: U.’ S. Metals Local

negotiations are being substituted for the death and destructive-
ness of war. As trade unionists. we know the great value of face-
t'o—fc:ce talks across the bargaining table. 4, ,

We share the high confidence of the American people that
the Korean War will soon be over—cznd we urge that the U. S.-
delegctteslo those negotiations do everything in their power to
speed them to c1 pectcectble conclusion. . _

THE DEEP WISH of every American is that with the WCII‘ over,
our economy can be ,shifted~.over_cts rotpidly as possible from a
"war" -footing to one bctsed on peace; Consideration should begin
at onée of steps to dbolish those hateful and onerous measures

We "demand. first and foremost“thctt the “wage freeze" be

wiped out and the Wage Stabilization Board dismantled im-
mediately. The wage freeze has been discriminatory. unjust and
downright vicious ever since the day it was ordered into effect.
Now it is . time to throw aside this weapon for depressing the
living standards of workers and their families. x V ’
Oppressive taxes, which for the worker are today 20 per
cent higher than they were before the Koreczn-shostilities began, v
mustcxlso be revised downwcxrd—instectd of upward as the Con-T
gress proposes. The “war justification" for-high taxes on7w_ork'-
ing people willdisctppeczr the moment Ct cecxse—fire isordered. ‘.
. WE BELIEVE. however, that the price. inflottion brought on 

fsthe Korean war will continue at least for some time after or set-
- tlement has been reached. Inflation in price and rents is <1 carry-
‘over .proble_m. left the nqtign in the wake of more t_hctn‘;l2 months

C: stable footing, we must have genuine price controls, ' dc-

.G.0mpctnied by rollbctcks in i4 prices on virtually every consumer

commodity, and establishment of specific ceilings on all prices.
The “strife of war emergency" was declared by the Presi-
dent, last December. in cm "h ur. when American troops were sur-

rounded or retreating in the h1lls of North Korea. But ‘the principle ‘
_ of negotiations has now taken over in Korea. There is no reason

why this principle" cannot. “take. over" by application to all the
oulstmaniding disputes that _disturb'- relations between the-two rnést

wins’ two new pacts

SUDBURY, Ont.——General Workers
Union Local 902 continues to chalk up
a great record of winning new bene-
fits for its members._ '

Heading the list of activities is an
interim wage increase just won for _
some 80 workers at the Sudbury Brew-
ing Co. The brewery contract opens in
two months“. .

Negotiations completed at the Stand-
ard Dairylresulted in a Wage increase
of $20 a month for ‘inside employees
and $13.50 a month in the ‘base rate
for milk salesmen plus one per cent
increase in commission rates which
amounts to approximately $27.50 a
month or a total of $40 a month in-
crease.

Additional gains include vacations of
ten days after one year, two weeks
after two years, double time statutory
holidays, compulsory deduction of
dues, etc.

Meantime, contract negotiations con-
cluded for workers of the National
Grocers, a wholesale distributing house,
brought wage increases ranging from
13}/2 cents to 37 % cents an hour, plus
two weeks vacation after one year,
nine paid ‘statutory holidays, etc.

The local’ is now preparing for sev-
eral negotiations with plants that have

' been under contract for the past year,
in addition to continued, organization
work in the district.

WASHINGTON—CIO president ‘Phil

fluence” on President Truman_.when' it
comes to matters that vitally affect}
labor. ,‘ 

Both of them pleaded with the Presi-1
dent to veto the vicious Mexican labor’
bill passed recently by Congress. Presi‘-‘-
dent Truman ignored their “inflnenc'e,”,L
listened instead to’ the Congressme
from the Southwest who speak for_th
giant farm interests, and signed_jthe
bill into law. 

President Truman also‘ ignored" the].
recommendations of a Commiss_ionr‘o’nj

pointed last year. The Cbmn1issio_ _
turned in a lengthy report in -.April,:
much of itdevoted to the ,terrible*' ex-
ploitation of migratory Mexican labor‘
in the Southwest. 
The President’s Commission made,ta°§;-—.
number of recommendations. They were‘
aimed chiefly at slowing down ‘the U.
S. Government’s connivance with th_ei
big farm interests in the illegal im
portation of some 400,000 Mexicans.

treatment of those Mexicans once they.

During its recent ineeting‘ in Denver,
the Mine-Mill -International Ervecutive
Board adopted ‘ this statement on the
‘Smith Act:

The recent decision of the U. S. Supreme
Court, upholding the Smith Act in the case
of the eleven Communist Party leaders, does
not stand by itself. For it is the same court

I which not long before upheld the «infamous
Taft-Hartley Act.'_ And in writing the ma-
jority decision of approval for the Smith Act,
Chief Justice Vinson used as a principal
basis the court’s earlier decision upholding
the"‘Taft-Harley Law. ‘

Black and Douglas, theﬁtwo Justices who
dissented from the majority opinion” on the

' Smith Act,’ also dissented in the Taft‘-‘Hartley
Case\and have ‘voted consistently in favor of
labor. On the other hand, the Justices who
subscribed to the majority opinion are the
same ones who have handed down one anti-
labor de'cision after another during these
years. ' '

"The doctrine of “conspiracy” was used as

   
   
   
   
  
   
    
   
   
   
  
  
 
   
  
  
   
  
   
  
  
 

for half a century. For a score of years af-
ter the Mine, Mill and,Smelter Workers Union
was founded in 1893 under the original name
of the Western Federation of Miners, it was
repeatedly called a “conspiracy” and its mem-
bers and leaders were prosecuted as conspir-
ators. '

‘WHEN IN 1907, Haywood, Moyer and Pet-
tibone went on_trial on framed-up charges of
A murdering Idaho’s Governor Steunenberg, the
j  prosecutors of the union leaders publicly
E ' called the uniona “criminal conspiracy.”

. - The Mine Owners’ Association which tried
to smash our union at Cripple Creek, Colo-.
' rado in 1903, circulated a pamphlet which
E charged that the Western Federation of Min-
_ ers.“is opposed to our present form of gov-
ernment and is aiming at its overthrow, to-

 
    
  
 

 

  

‘ constitution”—one of the commonest ways in
which the “conspiracy”, charge was made in
' those days. » ‘ .
The state criminal syndicalism laws, per-’
sistently usedin attempts to suppress early
organization of hardrock miners, sprang di-

trineiestablished earlier by the courts.
' But ultimately the workers of the Iand~suc-
ceeded in smashing this false conception of
“‘conspiracy.” They went ahead ‘to form
unions, And with the protection of the First
Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, these
I unions became. strong enough to convince the
courts that the conspiracy doctrine was a
fraud.‘ H , «
‘ Now, however, in the Smith Act case we
.7" see the “conspiracy doctrine” being revived
and its revival is accompanied by a» frontal
assault on the First Amendment. -

handed down three more anti1labor«deci_sions
on the same day. While these three decisions
on the surface were merely applications of
Taft-Hartley’s secondary boycott features,
the Court took the opportunity to go much
further ‘than it-ever has before in restricting
the right to strike and to‘ picket generally.
In -effect, these decisions virtually destroyed

the traditional right of AFL building trade_
unions,_to refuse to work with non-union labor --

or non-union materials. . ‘
How easy it will be to turn the Smith Act’

decision against the entire labor movement,

was -underscored in the dissentinglopinion of
Mr. Justice Black who said:

“These petitioners were n_ot
charged with an attempt to over-
throw the Government. Theywere
not charged’ with non—verbal acts of
any kind designed to overthrow the
government. They were not even
charged with saying anything or
writing anything designed‘ to over-
throw’ the Government. The charge
was that they agreedto assemble
and to talk and publish certain ideas
at a later date. . . .”

i_Not~ only the non-communist -but even the
anti-Communist -can see in Justice Black’s
dissent a warning that the criminal convic-

tion of-a man merely for “intent” to say

something in the, future, without engaging
in direct ‘action of any kind, endangers the
freedom of all. Americans and especially all

trade unionists.

By Graham Dolan

5‘ BAYARD, N. M.—This is more than
.-a strike for economic equality with
other workers in the district. This
strike has become a symbol of the
struggle of the Mexican people for dig-
nity and the achievement of first-class
citizenship. A

"The Empire Zinc strikers and other
members _of Local "890 are mostly of
_Mexican origin. Their defiance of the

“rules” laid down for their conduct has

infuriated the county’s ruling -clique,
L ‘V dominated by the mining operators.

The ruling clique is determined that
the Workers of Grant County shall
“learn their place.” The workers are
-. proving’ every day that they have
learned-—but not according to the

politicians, the-press and radio.

ON JULY 21, the six members of the
negotiating committee of the striking
Empire Zinc unit went to trial on an
order to show cause why they should
not be “held in contempt for allegedly

7 violating the temporary injunction. The
"six were local president Cipriano Mon-
toya, Int’l rep. Clinton Jencks, strike
chai_rman Ernest Velasquez, Pablo Mon-
toya, Vicente Becerra, and Fred Bar-
reras. The specific charge was that
theyihad violated the court’s order not
to block the road leading to the Em-
pire operations.
‘ On the night before the hearing 700

 and decided that “all of us are on trial

,, and we’ll all be there to defend our‘-

. selves.”

_ On July 23, Judge Marshall handed
-down his judgment. He fined Local 890

 and the International union $4,000 each

 

days in jail. The motion for an appeal
was granted.

MINE-MILL SUPPORTERS had not
,made the trip to Silver City for nothing.
They sent large delegations in to see
Sheriff Goforth. They demanded the

‘company gunmen who had been man-

down with automobiles, blackjacking
‘fthem and tear gassing women and
jchildren. '
'7 ..On Monday, '-Goforth said he was re-
lieving two of the deputies from their
.du_t;ies. for a day or two. The union's
_-ipressure on Goforth continues.

Twice over\the week-end, Local 890
demon‘strated its great strength. On
{Saturday night about 200 cars packed
_'-with strikers, their families, and sym-
_ -pathizers, paraded throughout the dis-
.-‘trict,._blowing horns and carrying slo-

-jthe caravan, hearing more than 1,000
persons, wound up at the Grant County
courthouse at Silver City and a mass
rally was held right ‘there on the lawns
and"streets. “No Marshall Law!” was
_\ their ‘slogan.

 -.-THE DEMONSTRATIONS have pro-
'yoked a new wave of strike-busting ac-
_.tivity. Now the Grant County Bar as-
_‘so_ciation has joined the district attor-
,  in filing criminal contempt charges

CASH ON THE BAVRRELHEAD. Two checks for $1,000 each came'in to 'l’lIe Empire ’Zic strike fund on 0

same day recent|y—one, from the El Paso Copper Refinery Workers Local 501: the other from the Fairmont
~ Smelter Workers Local 82. They represent only a fraction of. the money which has poured into the Bayard
strike fund in recent weeks from local ‘unions all over the International. Space does not permit us to print
a complete list of the many locals—and Auxiliaries—‘-which have- helped to swell the fund. making it possible

tion because he is alleged to have

stated that the law enforcement ma-.
chinery of Grant County is owned lock,

stock and barrel‘ by the mining com-
panies. Hearing on this new action is
set for August 6.

Meanwhile, fourother defendants had

charges against them‘ reduced from fel- '

onies to misdemeanors.» They are ac-
cused of assault and battery and have
received sentences in justice of the

peace court ranging from 20 to 40 days.

and have been fined $30 and $40. The

defendants are Julian Vargas, Juan Ar-
zola, Felix ‘Gomez, and Fred Young.
All are Mine-Mill "members at the Ken-
necott operation in Hurley. They are
accused of beating up a scab.

The company’s adherance to the Mo-
hawk Valley strike-busting formula
continues with published rumors of

' threatened vigilante action, and de-

mands _from Judge Marshall and C. C.
Royall, Sr., president -of the Grant
County Bar asso.ciation,'that Governor

Mechem send national guardsmen to the‘

district and declare martial law.

“We do not" need troops in Grant/

County any more than we needed the
companygunmen,” said strike chairman
Velasquez. “Company gunmen’s pistols

and nationalTguardsmen’s bayonets will
‘never produce an ounce of ore.”

Bridges files appeal, /
‘charges rights -violation

SAN FRANCISCO (GFP)-—Charging ”

violation of elemental constitutional
safeguards of -American freedom, attor-

' neys filed a brief in —the U. S. Court of

Appeals asking for reversal of last
year’.s conviction of President Harry
-Bridges, vice president J. R. Robert-
son and'Henry Schmidt ofthle Inter-r_ia--._

tional Longshoremen’s & Warehouse-,.

\men’s Union. . . _
The brief contends that ever since
Bridges became active as a union lead-

gr in 1934 there‘has_ been a .“concen-
trated and relentless crusade” against
him by government agencies, climaxed
by the 1950 trial and conviction of him
"and his associates on alleged perjury’
charges. ' _

‘—‘Tha,_t crusade is unique _ in the
‘annals o_f-American legal history ‘and
is one which, irrespective of the ulti-
.mate faz‘Ie,of Harry Renton Bridges,
the people and the courts of the.U.S.
might well ponder,” thelbrief declares.

“I t is alarming, not so much because
of what it can or mayrultimately do
to the three iudiviductlsfdirectly in-
1;olved_here, but because it ‘represents
a. _distortion of‘ governmental. process
for the purpose of achieving a pre-
couceived end and, if permitted to

succeed, will make ‘a, mockery of the '

proud boast that ours is a. government

Supreme Gourl outlaws
llmll union conlracls

WASHINGTON-—Here’s just another
example of how anti-labor the present
U. S. Supreme, Court really is.

The story -goes back to 1947-48, dur-
ing the period immediately after the
Taft-Hartley Act was passed. The Na-
tional Labor Relations Board officially

.advised both the AFL and CIO that

‘top officials of those federations did

not have to sign the non-Communist
affidavits. 4 .
So for many months, members of

the CIO and AFL executive boards-did»

not‘ sign the affidavits. Meantime,
thousands of local CIO and AFL unions
complied with the Taft-Hartley Act by
having their local leaders sign the af-
‘fidavits.

.Some-4,000 of those local unions won
union shop contracts during this pe'-
riod. Those contracts are still in effect.

Then came the U. S. Supreme Court
in June of this year, with a ruling that
the‘\ top officers of both AFL and CIO

.must sign affidavits under the Taft-
Hartley Act. - '

That Supreme Court decision forced
the National Labor Relations Board to
declare as illegal a union shop contract
between the auto workers union and

the forge division of Ford Motor Co.-

in Canton, Ohio. The agreement was
reached during the period when Phil
Murray and other "top CIO'officers had
not signed the affidavits.

The NLRB ruling in the Ford case

is automatically tossed out the window

some 4,000 union shop-agreements held
by local CIO and AFL unions. Thus

the Supreme Court has used a fancy,‘

unimportant legal point as a basis for
outlawing’ 4,000 union contracts.

'"‘"'  "@1903 que fuimos a visitar a esos com-

‘ —paiieros, ninguno pensébamos recon-

. trar una moral tan elevada. No p.ensa- _
bamos que fuera posible, que~las: es-
posas de esos compaﬁeros tuvieran tan
gran sentido de responsabilidad; de ~
co-operacién, que tuvieran en ellas ese
deseo de luchar junto con sus esposos,
para poder adquirir ‘un medioide vida
‘mas humarfo, mas equitativo, y con un

. A poco mas de' comfort para ellas ‘sus

1/. hijos y sus esposos. _ M

Mientras ellas_. permanecen en la
glinea de gua_rdia_cuidando que no pasen
esos trozosy de‘ escoria _human_a que les
nombramos “Esqui_roles” ellas estan
 consientgs _de’ se papel. Ellas saben

_*fq'ue en ellas esta la‘ responsabilidad. La

responsibilidadw que por cuestiones

hombros de \sus‘e-sposos. Y, cuando el-
lasfvieron que la felicidad futura de
sus hogares se tambaleaba y pensando
ﬁnicamenteten el lbienstar de sus hijos,
de ‘sus’ esposos y de ellas mismas, no

. .les importé nada. ‘ ‘

Cércel, macanas, pistolas, bombas de
