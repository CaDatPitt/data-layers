I DENVER——Two Mine-Mill bills were given top priority as projected goals in 'the“”

federal legislative program discussed by the International Executive Board at its final“, 
meeting of the year here last month.

With the opening of the new _Congress, the officers and Board members called?jV;_  .
for a renewed concentration of the union’s national legislative activity behind the
drives which have already initiated congressional movement on mine safety

Major breakthroughs were scored in both fields vital to protecting the health,
safety and longevity of thousands employed in mining and other hazardous-industries,-. 9
In each case, the union’s intensive lobby work in the nation’s capital accompanied -'-by
local supporting action from the field were key factors in achieving their active}cc_)n- ;

Tribute to
Bill Gately

DENVER—-A tribute to Bill
Gately, retired veteran Mine-
Mill organizer who died here
Oct. 27, has been received in
the International Union office
from another old friend, Jeff
Kibre, Washington Representa-
tive of the International Long-
shoremen’s & Warehousemen’s
Union.

In a letter to Mine-Mill Presi-
dent John Clark, Kibre wrote:

“I am deeply grieved to learn
that Bill Gately has passed
away.

“I first met Bill in 1937. I
shall remember him always.

“Bill was a man, a great son
of the working class. His last
full measure of devotion was to
the union movement, to the
struggle for a more decent
world, a world in which all
peoples of all colors and creeds
can walk in dignity and with
a sense of fulfillment.

“I like to think of Bill as the
song speaks of Joe Hilli Wher-
ever working people are or-
ganizing, wherever they are
fighting for a just share of
the good things of this earth-—
it’s there you’ll find Bill Gately.”

Meanwhile, the local reports
significant money gains won as
a result of settled grievances at
another bargaining unit under
Local 700 contract, the merged
operations of Great Western and

the Local 700 agreement.

Four grievances raised were
settled satisfactorily, the most
significant involving prepara-

their incentive earnings. The
settlement included daily post-

grievance was filed, the twelve

workers in the department have

averaged more than 22 cents

Tamale Sale

In San Manuel

Mary Horner of the San
Manuel Local 937 Auxiliary re-
ported early last month that
preparations were under way
for their annual tamale sale,
scheduled to take place Dec. 6
and 7. They hoped to be able to
sell at least 100 dozen, she said.

Previous activity of the group
included attendance by three of
its members—Mary Horner,
Colleen Derrick and Natie Mon-
tana——at the District 2. Con-
ference in Tucson. Many tick-
ets for a raffle being held by
the auxiliary were sold at the
conference. At the drawing
later, Stan Loder of Murray,
Utah, was the winner of a clock
radio. -

The raffle was a huge suc-
cess, bringing in a tidy sum
which the ladies set aside to
help the needy during the holi-
day season.

On behalf of the Ben Como
family of San Manuel, the aux-
iliary thanks Mine-Mill Presi-
dent John Clark for the con-
tribution of $25 he gavein their

-time of need.

Local Issueslwind Up
Seﬂlemenf for Hayden

HAYDEN, ’Ariz.—-—Agreement on local issues has
finally nailed down settlement by Local 939 with Kenne-
cott Copper Company on a new contract covering produc-
tion and maintenance workers at the Hayden reduction

plant here.

Application of Mine-Mill’s
western division-wide Ken-
necott settlement to this opera-
tion last July was delayed by a
Steelworkers raid which was
smashed in an NLRB election
on Sept. 12, clearing the way for
local negotiations.

All provisions of the division-
wide agreement are incorpo-
rated in the Local 939- settle-
ment, retroactive to July 1, 1962,
the same date as they became
effective for the other locals in
Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and
Nevada.

These include:
per hour general wage increase
plus increments; elimination of

est Peralta and Ruth Echever-
ria; and synthetic fibres district
steward Robert Brashear.

Business Agent Rito G. Valen-
cia services the local in negotia-
tions and grievances.

Locals 85 and 451

A new three—year contract
with Illinois Zinc Company was
negotiated jointly covering the
properties represented by Local
85 in Peru and 451 in Chicago.
The settlement was considered
good by local leaders in view of
the fact the company has shown
no profit in several years and
that, at the time of negotiations,

" the record showed a deficit of

more than half a million dollars.

Terms included: improved’
pension pain to provide that, if
the company closes the opera-
tions, men with at least 15 years
service will receive at the age
of 65 the benefits. in the plan to
the full extent of the funds con-
tributed to the plan; improved
seniority provisions; contract to
be binding on successor if

operations are sold.

An across-the-board wage in-
crease of six cents an hour be-
comes effective Oct. 1, 1963,
with another general increase
of five cents going into effec
on Oct. 1, 1964. ‘

Negotiating committeemen
were: President John Piano,

Jersey Locals in Lobby at 5

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

TRENTON, N. J .—An impres-
sive Mine-Mill lobby calling for
improvements in the New Jer-
sey state workmen’s com-
pensation laws was carried out
here December 14 at the state
capitol, featuring e X t e n s i ve
testimony by two Mine-Mill lo-
cal leadersf

Delegates from seven of the
union’s New Jersey area locals
were in attendance, represent-
ing altogether some 4,000 mem-
bers. ~

In addition, the lobby was
joined by two officials of the
Carteret Labor Council cooper-
ating in the effort to liberalize
the state’s compensation pro-

‘visions.

THE one-day lobby centered
‘on hearings before the State
Senate Committee headed by
‘Senator Ozzard, Republican of
Somerset county.

President John Infusino of L0-
cal 365 in Perth Amboy and
Grievance Chairman Charles
Artist of Local 837 in Carteret
spoke for the union in present-
ing the committee with precise
details, of Mine-Mill’s program

3:-4?—~-for more adequate workmen’s

compensation in the state.
A chief point in the program

‘ calls. for increasing the weekly

benefit payment to two-thirds
of a worker’s regular wages.
The present law fixes $40 week-
ly as a maximum for temporary
disabiltiy and $35 weekly for
permanent .disability.

FURTHER, in their testi-
mony, the two local leaders laid
out a full program proposed by
the union to:

- Increase the amount payable

' for loss of limbs and loss -of

life; -
.- Eliminate the waiting perio
for benefits payable;
- Raise the funeral benefits
from the present $400 to ‘$1,200;

were commended by the Senate
committee for the quality of
their testimony.

EARLIER in the day’s lobby
activity, the full union delega-
tion held a fruitful meeting with
Raymond F. Male, State Labor
Commissioner. District 6 Board
Member Alf r e d Petit-Clair,
heading the group, acted as

_ main spokesman.

The delegation raised ques-
tions with the Commissioner
concerning the method of state
inspections and investigations
into loss-of-life accidents. The
main labor complaint generally
has been that union leaders are
not consulted or even ap-
proached by the state inspectors
who make periodic visits to the
various plants.

As a result. of the meeting,
Mine-Mill locals were given as-

surances by the Labor Commis-_

sioner that relations between in-
spectors and local union leaders
would be improved, and that
state inspectors will be notified

Savannah Arbitration Victory
"§riReinforces Seniority Primi le

SAVANNAH, Ga.—-A very important arbitration case involving the principle of
seniority for Negroes .on the job has been won here by -Mine-Mill Local 870 at the
Pierpont Manufacturing Company. The decision and award in favor of the union was
handed down by Arbitrator Harold T. Dworet who heard the case Oct. 31.

Union member Carrie Bell Sims, a Negro employee, was ‘fired by the company for

threatening white worker
James Wilkins with a ham-
mer for needling her about hav-
ing exercised her seniority
rights.

As the arbitrator noted in his
opinion, it was “apparent that
James Wilkins held a grudge
against Carrie Bell Sims ever
since she had exercised her
seniority over him.”

it! it It

N0 blow was actually struck
‘and nobody was hurt in the in-
cident. —

[In pointing out that Wilkins
was given no discipline for his
part - in precipitating the inci-
dent for which the company dis-

, charged ‘Mrs. -Sims, Arbitrator-

Dworet said the issue was
vwhether Mrs, Sims was fired

v     foniilrlt.-cause-.»~

If, he said, discipline had
been administered to _both, “the
more severe discipline should
have been given to James Wil-

kins.”

THE discharge of Carrie Bell
Sims “was not for proper
cause,” he ruled.

The union's demand that Mrs.
Sims be reinstated with her
seniority rights and pay for all
time lost was granted in full.
She received $1,374.35 in back

Handling the case for the

union were Mine-Mill Regional

Director Jesse G. Doster, Local
870 Committee Chairman James

ber M;rs._.,Daisy Creac-h.

THE arbitration Victory was
considered of special impor-
tance to the local in that it
strengthens union efforts to
completely organize the plant.

Foremen have been known to

tell white workers in effect that
they did not have to join the

union because “the union be-l

longs to the Negroes and the
jobs belong to the company,” so
it is n,ow.fe1t the case will ex-
pose that lie.

Upholding of the union's posi-
tion by the arbitrator is also
expected to encourage the

THE day’s. lobby ended with
a summation of the state legis-
lative picture for next year by
Assemblyman Joseph Doren,
Democrat of Middlesex county.
Doren was instrumental in mak-
ing the lobby a success by par-
ticipating in setting up the ar-
rangements and in joining the
union in all discussions.

The Carteret Labor Council,
which participated in the day’s
activities, is comprised of most
local unions of the various inter-
national u n i o n s representing
workers in the Carteret area.

President of the Council is
Stephen Trosko, who is Presi-
dent of Mine-Mill Local 837 and
who also played a major part in

Mine-Mill Local 18 represents
the men at both operations

Steel’s petition for a represen-

on the grounds that AS&R
operation of both the Galena

a single combined unit, and
that the raid petition was there-
fore inappropriate.

Mine-Mill Int’l Rep. Lew
Cochran said that Steel was un-
able to petition for the entire
over-all bargaining unit of about
400 workers because “they
could not induce a sufficient
number of AS&R employees to
sign their raiding and splitting

THE MINE-MILLOUNION I

 

I a......ta.-,1 .,1.95

at if ‘Secretary-Treasurer
 Industry Faces New
   Year, Old Problems

S THIS ISSUE_ of Mine-Mill Union goes to press, the
holidays are upon us, the season when, traditionally,
we weigh our accomplishments in the year that is coming

_,;._M,to_a...elose,-and look ahead to what the future holds.

We can take satisfaction in the solid, substantial
improvements incorporated in our major con-
tracts this year, which also provide for addi-
tional wage gains in mid-1963.’ We face another
round of bargaining with the expiration of
these contracts 18 months from now.

In the meantime, what is the outlook for the
industries in which our members are em-
- ployed? The shrinkage of job opportunities due
’ to automation, introduction of more produc-
' tive equipment, and other technological de-
velopments continues inexorably. Before the
cutbacks and layoffs in copper mining and
smelting last summer, there were 23,800 men

 

Dlchter

in 1956. But this smaller work force was turning out more copper-
51.6 pounds per man-hour compared with 36.3 pounds in 1956.

**k*

HE story is the same in lead-zinc mining, in smelting and

refining of non-ferrous metals, in brass. It’s true in American
industry in general. And paychecks just liaven’t increased as fast

Walter Heller, Chairman of the President’s Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers, said recently that in U. S. industry output per
man-hour had risen by six percent since the- recession in early
1962, while the rise in real wages from August 1961 to August 1962
was only two percent. Meanwhile, the financial journals say
corporation profits this year will hit a new record.

Our industries have special problems of their own. Some
months ago I wrote in this column about the cooper trust’s monop-
olistic pricing policy of holding copper at 31 cents a pound in the
face of price cuts in competitive metals and plastics. Since then
there have been further cuts in plastics and aluminum. Aluminum

. now is only 22% cents a pound. The price spread between aluminum

and copper is now the widest in six years. This is driving cus-
tomers away from copper whenever a substitute material can be

1 used.

Meanwhile, the copper trust is buying up copper offered for

I I . sale in London and New York by small independents, in order to

_prevent a break in price. And the big producers’ stocks of unsold
copper are rising, despite widely publicized production cuts. The
cuts, however, don’t show up in the monthly production figures,
despite layoffs and shorter work-weeks.

*‘k‘k

NCLUDING copper bought from small independents, the big

U. S., African and European producers are holding close to
600,000 tons of copper off the market. Unsold stocks in this country,

' and abroad have risen by nearly 150,000 tons since the first of this

year. The big producers are staking millions of dollars on the
gamble that the price of copper can be held at 31 cents.

Whether they win or lose, the outlook is rough for jobs in
copper. If the price is held, copper users will look for substitutes.
-If the price breaks, there will be a rush to unload copper. Either
way, employment in copper is likely to shrink, and this is bound
to have its effect on jobs in the brass mills.

Lead and zinc in this countrygcontinue to be depressed. The
industry, like an ostrich with its head, in the sand, has continued
to agitate for higher tariffs that haVen’t a ghost of a chance to be
applied. _

I, think these facts about our industry should be thoroughly
understood by our membership. Only then can they be in a position
to understand Mine-Mill’s program to meet the situation. Only with
this understanding can we develop the grass roots support that will
be vital to putting the program across.

The cornerstone of our program is the preservation and ex-
pansion of job opportunities for our entire membership, job se-
curity, and security for those approaching retirement. Also funda-
mental to our program is a basic‘ improvement in health and
safety conditions in mining and non-ferrous metal smelting and
refining, and industry programs pointed at increased U. S. pro-
duction of non-ferrous metals.

‘k**

()UR program includes the following major objectives:
0 Enactment of the 35-hour week with no out in take-home

I pay. It’s estimated that .this would result in the creation of more

than 14,000 new jobs in copper, lead and zinc mining, non-ferrous
smelting and refining, and in brass.

O Passage of Mine-Mi1l’s bill permitting early retirement at
age. 60 without reduction of social security benefits, for miners and
workers in other hazardous occupations.

O Passage of the medicare bill to meet the medical and hos-
pital needs of our retired members.

0 Major emphasis in collective bargaining on adequate supple-
mental unemployment and severance benefits. '

. O Passage of federal safety inspection and enforcement legis-
 lation applicable to metal and non-metal mines and primary non-
- ferrous metal processing plants. -

. V , __ '0. Adoption of an international lead-zinc commodity agreement .
 to permit, increased U. S. mine production of lead and zinc and

»assui;e__.adequate supplies of concentrates for smelters dependent
on foreign sources of supply.

J Thisprogram has been hammered out in response to the_ con-
-c_,ern~._which our members have expressed at our national conven-
}ions, ‘in district conferences all over the country, and in bargaining
ouncilsessionsa overthe last few years. It’s ‘a program that's
ointed straight at the basic.,needs of the ‘worker in the, non-fer-
rousjinetals industry-_it’s .your_program, and yoursto A put across.

mid-terin election victory.



IF correct, this plus for JFK,
added to prestige he acquired
from the Cuban crisis, gives
the Administration greater op-
portunity to drive ahead on
Capitol Hill.

The big question, however,
is whether JFK will crack the
whip on domestic issues. And
crack it he must to make the
New Frontier come alive.

Congress came out of the
elections with no basic changes
in the legislative machinery. To
see this, it’s useful to recall
some political facts of life.

MANY things other than nu-
merical party strength deter-
mine Congressional per-
formance. The conservative
coalition, the Rules Committee

and 0th e r procedural road- »

blocks, rigged committees and
reactionary
are what count.

None were issues in the elec-
tions, but they're the realities
of our lawmaking system and
a good frame of reference in
sizing up Congress.

Take the House first, where
most progressive measures died
in recent years.

*2! 13¢ 1!!

OUT of 435 Representatives
who won in November, 368 are
incumbents, 67 are newcomers,
2 are former members. The
partisan lineup stands at 259
Democrats and 176 Republi-
cans, a net gain of 2 for the
latter. Shufﬂing of seats, obvi-
ously, was minimal.

Even more significant, there
was no real shift in the strength
of the several voting blocs: lib-
erals, the swing group, the con-
servatives. The conservative
coalition, the dominant force on
most domestic legislation, re-
mained virtually intact.

At the most, as a Congres-
sional Quarterly analysis of the
newcomers shows, President
Kennedy picked up a possible
handful of supporters.

Plainly, this means the votes
are not on the line for labor or
advanced social welfare legis-
lation. ‘

ALREADY liberal, the Senate
promises to be more so as a
result of the election. Demo-
crats added 4 seats to their ma-
jority, making the lineup 68 to

notable exchanges for the bet-

ALTHOUGH the 88th Con-

as a new model, it does offer
some interesting qualitative im-
provements. There’ll be several
more voices for peace, against
the Un-American Activities
Committee, and for progressive
causes generally.

Candidates backed by peace
groups won 3 of 18 races in
which they were entered; and
of 12 incumbents receiving sim-
ilar support, only 1 was de-
feated. Several outspoken foes
of witch-hunting were re-
elected; they’ll be joined by
some newcomers.‘ The return of

DENVER—Support of local
strikes by the United Steelwork-
ers and Oil, Chemical & Atomic
Workers in the non-ferrous
metals industry was‘ expressed

. by the Mine-Mill Executive
Board at- its meeting here last
month.

Some 1,500 workers repre-
sented by Steel Local 6242 have
been on strike against the St.

* Joseph Lead Company in Flat
(‘Riven Mo., since last July 27.
x ’ ' About an equal number of mem-
bers of OCAW Local 2-24410
struck the American Metals-
’ Climax Molybdenum Company's
mining property at Climax,
Colo., on, July 18.

Similar messages of support
were sent by the Mine-Mill of-
ficers to both striking locals.

“All labor union’s,” the letter
said, “face increasingly. tough
opposition from the corporations

against improvement of living —

standards, maintenance of long-
standing contract conditions, and
efforts to protect members from
.....,.....the impact of automation. Your

all union members.”
, The Board messages also said
that Mine-Mill locals in both
areas were being advised to
lend all assistance possible to
assure satisfactory settlements
of the strikes.

AFL-CIO Links
Shorter Week to
Full Jobs Need

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Estab—
lishment of a shorter work week
as a main means to reduce and
control unemployment was re-
emphasized by AFL-CIO econo-
mists in a recent issue of the
American Federationist.

The merged federation’s De-
partment of Research advocated
a drive for reduced hours with-
out cut in pay both in bargain-
ing and in legislative ap-
proaches to lower the 40-hour
standard now set by federal
law.

A point made in the article is
that most measures now being
used or contemplated to ease
the‘ impact of unemployment
are geared to helping the job-

less worker prepare for and‘

hunt for a new job, or to ease
the financial shock of his loss
of job.

Aid to Fght Frame Asked in

Charleston Local Strike Case

CHARLESTON, S. C.——A renewed plea for funds to help fight the case of two
Mine-Mill local leaders facing double jeopardy in frame-up charges as a result of‘a
strike was issued here last month by the Charleston Local 863 Defense Committees
Details of the ease up to that time were carried in the August, 1962, issue of the Mine-

Mill Union.
In the recent communi-
cation to all Mine-Mill lo-
cals, the Committee recalled
that the charges against the two
rank and file leaders grew out
of their Local 863 strike over
basic trade union wage and con-
tract issues.

LOCAL 863 President John
Frazier and Shop Steward Hol-
man Waters were suddenly ar-
rested last May for alleged in-
volvement in a year-old episode
during which a busload of scabs
being transported to the struck
Planters Fertilizer & Phosphate
Company plant was fired upon.
Nobody was reported hurt in the
incident.

The plant is located just out-
side the city of Charleston.

Because it was alleged the
bus was shot at in two adjoin-
ing counties-—Dorchester as well
as Charleston.-—..the men were
indicted in both counties.

The charges filed against
them are extremely serious: as-

sault and attempt to murder,
assault and battery, and con-

spiracy to assault and attempt

to murder.

THE case in Charleston.

county was originally supposed
to have been tried during Sep-
tember, but was passed over
until a later term of the court.

In the meantime, Frazier and
Waters were brought to trialin
Dorchester county on October 9.
Frazier was declared not guilty.
Waters was sentenced to 10 and
5 years in jail, the sentences to
run ‘concurrently.

As the Mine-Mill Union went
to press, both men were cur-
rently scheduled to be brought
to trial in Charleston county on
the same charges on which they
were tried in Dorchester county.

THE Charleston Defense Com-
mittee’s appeal for funds
pointed out that “this case grew
out of a 12-month strike forced
on the Local 863 members when
the company refused to make
any contract offer at all after
months of fruitless negotiations
involving Federal Mediation.”

It emphasized that, out of 17

Wreck Job

011 Unions

WASHINGTON, D. C.——A se-
cret document prepared for use
by the National Association of
Manufacturers has been un-
covered which details the blue-
print of a three-year plan to
wreck American unions.

Labeled “Not for Distribution
——Confidential,” the document is
a 37-page initial progress report
prepared by the NAM’s “Center

- ;or the Study of Union Monopoly

 Power.”

““"“‘¥S8th

It fell into the hands
of Reverend Clair M. Cook of
the Religion and Labor Council
of America.

Rev. Cook said he preferred
not to reveal how he managed
to procure the document which
has been termed “fantastic”'in
its detail by those who have
studied it.

=l< * =l<

THE long-range goal of the
NAM effort, to which according
to the document “no publicity is
to be given,” is to persuade
Congress, particularly the new
Congress, to enact laws
vastly more restrictive against
unions than the present Taft-
Hartley and Landrum-Griffin
Acts.

The NAM allegedly hopes its
three-year program would legal-
ly limit unions to purely local
activities—spelling an end to
industry-wide bargaining -— and
deny the right to united labor
action in any field.

A federal compulsory open
shop law is another goal in-
cluded in the NAM blueprint of
wreck action against unions.

A strike over accumulated
grievances began November 29
at Southern Peru Copper Com-
pany’s big Toquepala open pit
mine. The company is con-
trolled by American Smelting
and Refining Co. Minority stock-
holders are Phelps-Dodge Corp.,
Cerro Corp. and Newmont Min-
ing Corp. The Ilo smelter was
forced to shut down December
10 as concentrates from Toque-
pala that had been stockpiled
were exhausted. The strike
ended December 1. Settlement
terms were not available at
Mine-Mill Union press time.

Meanwhile, also on December
17, workers struck at Cerro de

Peruvian Minister of Labor
granting an 8 percent wage
boost. Negotiations on a new
agreement had been going on
for some time. Cerro de Pasco
is a New York based producer

The strikers rioted and set
fire to several buildings. Two
workers and a policeman were

i killed, and several on both sides

were wounded. The Peruvian
government promptly r u s h e d
troops to La Oroya. Company
officials estimated p r o p e r t y
damage at $4 million.

Africa

A rash, of strikes and walk-
outs hit a half dozen African
copper producing facilities late
in November and early Decem-
ber. In Rhodesia, Rhokana
mine, with 7,500 workers, went
down November 28. The strike
forced a "slowdown at Anglo-

_ American Corporation’s nearby
j.Nchanga- and Bancroft mines,

 at ‘Rhokana.’ Rhokana workers "

.« z’ _.

returned to their jobs December
5, after the company agreed to
discuss grievances and demands
with the African Mineworkers

Union.

Mufulira workers, 1,000 strong,
staged a one-day walkout No-
vember 30, while 6,800 workers
struck Rhodesian Selection
Trust's Roan Antelope mine De-

still struck at Mine-Mill Union
press time.

200 workers walked off the job .

at Tsumeb Corporation’s new
copper smelter in Southwest
Africa the firstlweek in Decem-
ber. Cause of the walkouthas

were back to normal the follow-

Chile

Striking workers at Anaconda
Company’s El Salvador mine
and Potrerillos smelter in Chile,
on the bricks since November 1,
settled early in December and
were back at work about De-
cember 10.

A new 15-month pact provided
a 21.1 percent wage increase

plus .“return-to-work” bonuses
of $32 for single men and $55
for married workers. Settle-
ment was reached after the
Chilean government entered the
bargaining picture.

The company’s previous offer
had been a 15. percent wage
hike, while the union had asked
25 percent for white collar work-
ers and 30 percent for miners.

Flies High

Anybody would think that mis-
siles and martinis don’t mix in
the same company, but here’s
a news item which proves dif-
ferent.

The New York Times reported
recently that the Autobar-sys-
tems division of Ametek Inc. is
producing a new martini-mak-
ing machine for home consump-
tion which is ‘already in use at
bars and restaurants.

Ametek-smakes precision in-
struments, including missile
components.

THE news item says that Ame-
tek assembly lines for the mar-
tini-maker and the missile parts
are adjacent to each other in
the company’s Sellersville, Pa.,
plant.

Want to really fly high? Use

.one part missile, one part gin,

and away we go!

 

 

KENNECOTT COPPER CORP. announced last month it was
recalling 156 men to work at the Bingham Canyon open pit mine
in Utah. .

A. total of 580 workers had been laid off at all Kennecott facili-
ties in Utah September 10 when the company announced a ten‘
per cent cutback in copper production. The men are being recalled
at Bingham Canyon to step up the removal, of overburden at the
mine. - ‘

ANACONDA COMPANY is reported to have run‘ into sub-
stantial veins of high grade copper ore on the lower levels of the
Mtn. Con and Steward mines ‘in Butte. Some ore has run well over
11 percent copper. ' '

One vein in the Steward mine, according to the companyfis’
an. offshoot of the original Anaconda vein, discovered in 1886,
which established Butte as a major copper producer.

A major vein at about the 4500 foot level at the Mtn. Con mine
has been developed on one strike a distance of 3,500 feet, with
developments on two offshoots to 950 and 450 feet to date.

NEW JERSEY ZINC COMPANY mine at Hanover, New Mex-
ico shut down December 1. In a statement announcing the closing
of the mine a. company spokesman blamed “the adverse effect of '
foreign imports of zinc at low prices” for the closing.

135 production and maintenance workers represented by Mine-
Mill Local 890 were laid off by the company. The mine had been
producing at a daily rate of 800 tons ofore.

INTERNATIONAL COPPER RESEARCH ASSOCIATION has
developed protective coatings for copper and brass which will
keep them bright indefinitely if not exposed to the sun’s rays.

The new coatings, using silicone and acrylic resins, won’t work
on pots and pans either. Costs of the coating materials’ will run
about 21/2 cents per square foot, not including costs of application.

The association is continuing its search for-a coating that will.‘
be effective outdoors.

ALUMINUM producers early last month announced another
price cut of one and a half cents per pound; new price is 22%
cents. This increases the spread between copper and one of its big
competitors,-aluminum, to 81/2 cents, highest since copper’s big
boom year of 1956.

SOVIET copper production, estimated at about 600,000 tons
per year in a recent dispatch, is falling short of Soviet consump-
tion. ' .

Premier Khrushchev recently called for an intensified scrap
collection drive, aimed at old copper samovars, pots, pans and
other objects, and urged substitution, wherever possible, of alumi-
num and plastics for copper.

He complained that the Soviets had to pay in gold for copper
imported from abroad to supplement domestic production.

ANACONDA COMPANY will soon construct a 25-mile long pipe-
line from Anaconda to -Butte to supply water for the concentrator
being relocated in Butte. Expected flow will be 18 million gallons

TSUMEB CORPORATION, Southwest African copper, lead and
zinc producer, 29.13 percent owned by American Metal Climax, has
just brought a new copper smelter into production. The plant will

.(Conti§g§ed from Page 1)

gation this year, the Secretary
of Interior is required to report
back to Congress with recom-
mendations for further action

 on legislation.

The union’s officers feel that
‘submission of the Interior Sec-
retary’s rep_ort and recommen-
dations,,expected by about next

"”“~'Septeinber, should set the stage

for the kind of a permanent
mine safety law covering the in-
/dustry which Mine-Mill has been
advocating for. years.

Meanwhile, the officers em-
phasized the importance of co-

A _ operation by locals in the field

with the Mines Bureau to assure

J successful completion of the In-

terior report. This includes the
prompt reporting of fatal and
disabling accidents, cooperation
in the Bureau's health and safe-
ty surveys, and consultation

with the Bureau on specific ,

safety problems.

“ANOTHER legislative break-
through by the union came last
year with the introduction in
Congress of the Mine-Mill bill
on early retirement.-

Based entirely on proposals

'_ I in a document for the measure
’ prepared by the Union’s ‘Re-

search Department, the legisla-
tion was introduced simultane-
ously in the House by Congress-

men Joseph M. Montoya (D.,_

N. M.) and David S. King D.,
Utah), with an identical bill also
submitted later by Cong. Arnold
Olsen (D., Mont.).

.The legislation was assigned
to the House Ways and Means
Committee. Unfortunately, how-
ever, by the time the reports
on it were ‘ground out by the
appropriate executive agencies
of the government, it was too

‘late, in the session for com-

mittee hearings.

. 31¢ >2= >11

PLANS of the Mine-Mill ex-
ecutive board now call for
prompt re-introduction of the

dbill early enough in the 88th

Congress so that hearings can
be scheduled, the union’s aim

 

being to gain positive action for
its enactment this year.

Such a law would permit op-
tional retirement at age 60 with
full Social Security benefits for

. miners and workers in other oc-

cupations dangerous to health
and safety. It would enable
workers on such jobs to retire,
if they wish, five years earlier
but on the same basis as the
Social Security Act now pro-
vides for workers retiring at
age 65. .

The proposed legislation is in
the form of an amendment to
the Social Security Act, calling
for investigations for the pur-
pose of designating hazardous
occupations. It specifies that

AS LAW, it would authorize
retirement at age 60 with full
benefits for anyone who desired
to do so and who had put in 10
years in any designated haz-
ardous occupation.

Thebill is intended to be ap-

plicable to miners and to mill,

smelter and refinery jobs where
exposure to metallic poisoning,
toxic fumes and dusts and other.
hazards is present. ’

Other hazardous occupations
which would be considered
under the bill include work in
logging and sawmills, stevedor-
ing, coal mining, oil, heavy con-
struction and others.

Mine-Mill will solicit support
for the measure from among
other unions representing work-
ers in those industries.

Boost in Social Security

Tax Rate New in Effect

WASHINGTON, D. C.———It started on January 1-
workers’ paychecks will be somewhat lighter, but their
long-range benefits from the depletion is scheduled for
general payoff in various ways-. ~ - ’

On Jan. 1, 1963, the new Social Security tax rate

Went into effect. ‘

For employed people the V

1963 rate is,3 and %-percent for
the employee and the same
amount for the employer, a total
increase of one percent. The
maximum taxable amount of
earnings remains at $4,800.

The increase means that an
employed person earning $4,800
or more during 1963 will pay
$174 in Social Security tax in-
stead of the $150 he paid" on
those earnings in 1962.

° With 52 weekly checks totaling

$4,800, about 46 cents more will
be withheld from each week.
His employer's tax will also be
about 46 cents more a week.

duced old-age insurance bene-
fits at 62; d ,

ROTHER ISIDRO SANDAVOL of Local 124, Ruth, Nevada, ’ 
was injured fatally November 3 when he jumped or was“ A
thrown from a mobile front end loader that went‘ over a bank while '
he was driving it to the work area of the Liberty open pitcopper
mine of the Kennecott Copper Company.  '  *
While traveling down a five percent incline the loader suddenly‘:-§»'
began crossing the 36-foot wide road at a 12-degree angle. The right“ ‘ i- 71
wheels rode the 20-26 inch high berm for 34 feet before the loader
tipped sideways and rolled -down the bank. Sandavol, while waiting :_
for the ambulance, told fellow workers that the steering mechanism‘ .
became difficult to work and that the brakes did not work. 
The accident was investigated by a safety representative of - '
the U.S. Bureau of Mines. His accident report stated: “The acci-3
dent apparently was caused by malfimctioning of the steering and . 
brake mechanisms which probably was due to ‘the air pressure
decreasing to below 80 psi. Lack of an emergency brake was a con-‘
tributing factor. . - A a .,
“Compliance with the following recommendation may prevent
accidents of a similar nature :, Brakes of mobile loaders, should be
equipped so that they will be activated automatically when the air: ,
pressure decreases to below a predetermined setting, or ‘each. .
loader should be equippedwith an effective emergency brake.-‘P >
