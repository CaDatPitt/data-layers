rageous .policy, the Marshall Plan in action, is'to make Greece
a military fortress, with its guns pointed toward the U.S.S.R.

In Indonesia, where the people are in open revolt against
their Dutch imperialist oppressors, the United States is lend-
ing armed support to the Dutch. It gave these reactionaries a
$195,000,000 loan through the International Bank; it accords
the Dutch Government in Indonesia full diplomatic recogni-
tion and support; and its guns and planes are being freely
used by the Dutch armed forces against the army of the Indo-
nesian Republic. In order to cover up a bit our shameful role
in this reactionary war, the then-Secretary of State, Mr. Byrnes,
ordered the Dutch military leaders to remove all American
markings from their guns, planes and ammunition.=Without
American support in Indonesia, as in Greece, the democratic
forces would quickly overpower their reactionary oppressors.

In the civil war in China, too, the United States is an active
participant, with money, guns and troops, on the side of the
rotten, reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government. Four billion
American dollars have already been squandered in a futile
attempt to crush. the democratic movement. Now another

billion is scheduled to go to Chiang. At present, 1,000 Ameri-9

can combat officers and men are training and advising Chiang’s
armies, and recently the U.S. government gave this butcher of
the Chinese people 271 naval "vessels. American officials, in
reality, are practically -taking over Chiang’s government. The
main obstacle to victory for the Chinese people is American
imperialism. Chiang’s armies, of themselves, are weak and
ineffective. Hanson W. B_aldwin, no friend of the Chinese
people, said (N. Y. Times, Oct. 12), “What ﬁghting capacity
they [Chiang’s armies] still possess is due chieﬂy to United
States aid.” The strategic purpose behind this outrageous civil
war policy in China is to transform that country into a vast
American dependency and fortress and to mobilize its many
millions for the hoped-for Wall Street war against the U.S.S.R.

The general danger in -all this war prop-aganda, war prepa-—

ration, and. stimulation of civil war in various countries is
obvious. Unless the American people put a halt to it by quar-
antining and disarming the warmongers, it may well lead-
as its Wall Street backers intend it to lead—to World War III.

Wall Street’s Drive for World Domination

What is the cause of all these warlike developments? The
reactionaries have a ready answer to this question. They blame
everything on the Soviet Union, which they accuse of im-
perialist expansion. But this is nonsense. The U.S.S.R. is a
Socialist country and fundamentally non-imperialist. Besides,
it lost perhaps 15,000,000 dead in the last war and its indus-
tries and cities were frightfully devastated. Its whole situation
absolutely demands peace. It is absurd to allege" that such a
country is fomenting world war. Its policy is based deﬁnitely

upon friendly relations between the peoples underboth capi-

talist and Socialist regimes.

The real culprit is to be found closer to home: Its name is
American Big Business and its habitat is Wall Street. The
great monopolists, with the same ruthlessness that they show
in ruling this country, are seeking to dominate the world.
They are out to capture the world's markets, industries, re-
sources, and strategic positions. The vast economic,‘ political
and military resources of the United States are in their hands,
and they see that most of the rest of the world is war-ravaged
and impoverished. So they deem the situation‘ ripe ‘for them
to take over. _ ' '

The Taft-Hartley act in this country and the Marshall Plan
in the rest of the world—these are the the twin policies of con-
quest, domes-tic and foreign, of_ American Big Business, of
Wall Street imperialism. This year, the proﬁts of the corpora-
tions, after paying taxes, will be 171/2 billions. Their greed
has already sent the cost of living skyrocketing. But they want
more and more and more proﬁts. They have the boundless
appetite of monstrous hogs. They see as the great obstacle in
their imperialist path the Soviet Union, the new democracies
in Europe, the newly-independent colonies, and the labor
unions and Communist movement of the world, so they want
to crush them. '

The following quotations give the real ‘explanation of the
present world tension:
11

 

 

“In foreign affairs, the reactionary representatives of
Wall Street have carried over to other nations struggling
to rise from serfdom and servitude the same repressive
and tyrannical policies which they have enacted into the
anti-labor laws of the 80th Congress.” (SENATOR CLAUDE
PEPPER, Oct. 14, 1947)

“Whatever the ou-tcome of war, America has embarked
upon a career of imperialism. . . . Even though by our
aid, England should emerge from this struggle without
defeat, she will be so impoverished economically and
crippled in prestige that it is improbable she will be able
to resume her dominant position in world affairs. At
best, England will become a —junior partner in a new
Anglo-Saxon imperialism.” (VIRGIL JORDAN, President of
the National Industrial Conference Board, early in 1941)

“The United States stands at the pinnacle of world
power. . . . Opportunity is here now, clear and shining,
for both our countries [i.e., to grab world control-
W.Z.F.]. (WINSTON CHURCHILL, Mar. 5, 1946)

“The’2oth century is the American century. . . . The
big point to be made here is simply that the complete
opportunity of leadership is ours.” (HENRY R. LUCE, Life,
Feb. 17, 1941) _ 1

Beware of World War III!

The workers and the whole American people must be on
guard against the anti-Soviet World War III, that Wall Street,
in its greed for world domination, is trying to rush humanity
into. The United States got by pretty easily in World Wars I
and II. Other peoples did most of the ﬁghting and suffering
and dying. We had relatively light casualty lists, no war devas-
tation whatever, and after the wars we experienced big pros-
perity “booms.” In fact, capitalist America grew fat and rich
on these two great world disasters.

But for the United States, World War III would be some-
thing else again. On both sides there would be atomic bombs
12

 

 

and other dreadful weapons.* We could be sure of tens of milr
lions of casualties and of widespread destruction of our cities»
The warmongers are even now glibly trying to condition! the‘
American people to be ready to accept a loss of 4o,ooo‘,ooo«
lives in the anti-Soviet war which they are trying to organize.

This would be one world war that the United States would
have to ﬁght practically alone. War-weakened Great Britain,
Germany, Japan, France and Italy, for a considerable period}
could not give this country any serious military support, even
in the very doubtful event that the reactionaries in those lands
could succeed’ in forcing their war-weary and rebellious

peoples into the war. The United States, in such a war,

would be confronted by many democratic and Socialist
peoples, resolved to defend their national independence_and
determined to defeat Wall Street's attempt to enslave the
world. “We are not loved in Europe,” says Henry Wallace
(New Republic, Oct. 6), “and -the more we use economic
pressure to intervene in European affairs, the worse we are
hated.” Let Wall Street but launch a new world war and that
would be the end of the “reservoir of good feeling for America"
that once so pleased Wendell Willkie.

What a tragedy to the United States an anti-Soviet war
would be has been indicated by no less a military authority
than General Eisenhower. It would be a lost war, a devastating
calamity. Answering those fanatical warmongers who believe
the U.S.S.R. could be defeated merely by showering a few

. Russian industrial centers with atom bombs, Eisenhower

warned:

“Our people do not want a war which could have no
end but the destruction of the greater part of the world..
Atom bombs or no, war still means knocking out the’

opposing armies. . . . We saw what happened to the ﬁnestv
armies the world ever saw. If we tried to conquer Russia,..

there's no telling when we could establish ourselves one
her soil. But once we did, we'd face years of slogging;

* Just as this pamphlet goes to press, ForeignhMinister Molotov’ of the‘
U.S.S.R. has stated that the secret of the atom bomb “has long. sinceceaseds
to exist.” “

13

 

 

through Siberia. We have nothing to gain to start, and
would have nothing left at the end.”

Wall Street's plan to conquer the world is as crazy at Hit-
ler's, and it is cut from the same imperialist cloth. The
democratic, peace-loving forces in the world are today in-
comparably stronger and better able to resist war aggressors
than they were whenythe Hitler gang started out upon its
world" conquering rampage. Therefore, if Wall Street dares to
provoke a war to establish its world domination the conse-
quences will be far more disastrous to it than they have been
for the clique of big capitalists, whose spokesmen were Hitler,
Mussolini, ‘and Tojo. Those Social-Democratic and ‘conserva-
tive’ trade union leaders in both the A. F. of L. and the C.I.O.,
who are so eagerly endorsing Wall Street's Marshall Plan and
who are indulging in the warmongers’ Red-baiting and. Soviet-
hating hysteria, should ponder a bit upon the foregoing facts
.of life. ‘

Quarantine the Warmongers!

The American people are peace-loving, and they hate war.
They long to live in peace with the U.S.S.R. and all other
“nations. But to do this they must defeat the Wall Street war-
mongers and return to the cooperative international policies
-of Roosevelt. An anti-Soviet war is neither necessary nor
inevitable. A democratic America can have a fair and friendly
working agreement with the U.S.S.R. for the asking.

The ﬁrst thing necessary to this end is to put a stop to the
‘Hitler-like warmongering and Red-baiting hysteria now going
-on in this country. The anti-warmongering resolution of the
United Nations must be strictly enforced. A halt, too, must
be made to Wall Street’s militarization of the United States.
A friendly policy of liberal ﬁnancial grants to all war-devas-
tated countries, under the general policies of the United Na-
tions, must be substituted for the imperialist, V war-breeding
Marshall plan. The whole program of domestic reaction—the
militarism, the lynching of Negroes, the Jew-hating, the union
busting, the Un-American Committee Red-baiting, etc., must
14

 

 

nu «. mart-rA~.vsnnF>!>b'-as-u-I .4.) —>n.«v-z$e<9>«

*3 .


 

also be beaten in the United States. The warmongers should
be quarantined, and when necessary put into jail, as advocates
of the most frightful of all crimes, imperialist war.

The capitalist warmongering can be ﬁnally ended, however,
only when the Hoovers, Vandenbergs, Trumans, Rankins and
Deweys are defeated by the masses. Consequently, the coming
elections must mark a great political victory of the peace-
loving, democratic American people over such imperialists.
The Roosevelt democratic coalition of workers, farmers, Ne-
groes, veterans, youth, women, and intellectuals must be re-
formed, in the shape of a great new third party, a people’s
party, a party directed against the monopolists and war-
mongers and for a democratic peace. The big grass roots
movement behind Henry Wallace shows that the people are
ready for this great step forward.

Organized labor bears a heavy responsibility in the task
of crushing Wall Street’s warmongers. Butlabor must realize
that it cannot defeat reaction in this countrywhile supporting
Wall Street’s main reactionary policy abroad, the Marshall
plan. The trade unions should also bridle the Red-baiters and
warmongers in their own ranks, who consciously or uncon-
sciously, are taking their ‘policies from the N.A.M. and repeat-
ing the war propaganda of Wall Street. Organized labor must
learn that there is a direct connection between the fascist
danger in this country and the war danger abroad. Both are
the products of Wall Street’s imperialist greed.

The peoples of the world are on the march forward to
economic prosperity, to democracy, to peace, to Socialism.
They are determined -to realize in life the great democratic
goals for which the recent terrible war was fought and won.
And all the gold and industrial power, propaganda trickery,
and armed force of America Big Business, and its fascist,
clerical, and Social-Democratic allies all over the world, cannot
stop them.

Quarantine the Warmongers
S By WILLIAM z. FOSTER

ANY liberal‘ organizations and‘ the Communist Party,
M as well as the Soviet Union and a large group of coun-
tries in the United Nations, are charging that a viru-
lent campaign of warmongering is now going on in the United
States. They claim that powerful forces are again trying to
plunge the world into another, even more terrible war. The
United Nations, upon Soviet insistence and in the face of
strong American-opposition, has even adopted a weak resolu-
tion against warmongering. The United States delegates
strongly denied all charges of warmongering -in this country.
But let us see the kind of pro-"war stuff that is being fed to the
people by the American press and radio:

The Warmongering Campaign

0 “If we were willing to go to war to save Europe from

- Nazi domination, does not the ‘inexorable logicf of our
own behavior demand that we be willing to go to war
to save Europe from Soviet domination?” (Wall Street
Journal, Aug. 13, 1947)

9 “George H. Earle, former Pennsylvania Governor_. .
said last night that he would settle the Russian prob-
lem by ‘dropping an atomic bomb’ on the Kremlin.”
(United Press, Oct. 1 1, 1947)

0 “We can't do business with Stalin, just as we couldn't
do business with Hitler.” REPRESENTATIVE o’KoNsK1 of
Wisconsin.

0 “Several of the speeches identiﬁed_Russia inferentially
as the probable enemy in the next war. Two speeches
were so frank in this regard that the army generals who
delivered them cautiously asked reporters that those

3

 

portions be kept off the record.” (N. Y. Times, Aug.
28, reporting the American Legion Convention)

Commander O'Neil, in the American Legion Conven-
tion, declared that “expanding Communism is the
most virulent threat ever faced by our people. It is far
more dangerous than Nazism, fascism and nipponism
combined.”

0 At the A. F. of L. Convention, General Mark Clark
virtually called for war on the U.S.S.R.

C Colonel Maas, in explaining that the world is “choos-
ing sides” for a Soviet-American war, predicted that
“Our principal allies would be Germany and Japan."
(N. Y. Times, Oct. 30)

0 On Oct. 1 1, in an hysterical anti-Soviet radio harangue,

Walter Winchell shouted that “except for armies in the
% ﬁeld, the third world war has already begun.” He;
u accused the U.S.S.R. of spreading cholera germs in.
Egypt as a military experiment and of plotting “5o
Pearl Harbors” against the United States. He prac-
tically called for war against the U.S.S.R.

K 0 “There can be but little doubt but that the same de-
4 bate has been going on in the Kremlin that went on in
‘.6. the Reichschancellory under Hitler.” (ALFRED M. LAN-

DON, Mar. 25) 

’ 0 Rep. C. J. Karsten, of Wisconsin, demands -that the
U.S.S.R. should be brought before the United Nations
and “charged as an aggressor and as a potential and
deliberate perpetrator of world war.”

0 “Many an American General in Japan talks of com-
manding a Japanese army equipped and staffed by
Americans. . . . Recently Kamikaze (suicide pilots)
have been reporting in considerable numbers to Amer-
ican airﬁelds, ready to ﬂy in the new war against the-
Soviet Union, which they have heard has already’
started.” (F. KERR, Foreign Editor of News Week)

horizon would brighten with hope.” (WILLIAM c. BUL-
LI'I'I‘, Life Magazine, Oct. 13)

0 In his book, Speaking Frankly, Ex-Secretary of State
James F. Byrnes proposes that the United States and
its allies draft a German treaty and if the U.S.S.R. re-
fuses to sign it, they should drive the Red Army out
of Eastern Germany. The Times of London com-
mented that this monstrous proposition “seems little
better than a simple recipe for war.”

These quotations are only a drop in the ocean of war agita-
tion now going on in the press and radio. In the Hearst-
McCormick-Patterson gutter sheets, and in the mouths of such
reactionary radio commentators as Kaltenborn, Taylor, Win-
chell, and others, this propaganda reaches the stage of hysteria.

If all this isn't warmongering, the ‘advocacy of aggressive
war, then the English language has lost its meaning. Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt, a U.S. delegate to the United Nations,
defends this outrageous campaign of saber-rattling on the
grounds that it is merely the expression of a free press. She
stated (Oct. 5): “The Soviet resolution makes the elimination
of warmongering an assignment. We are not willing to agree
to this.” Actually, these reactionaries are advocating the great-
est outrage in the world, aggressive war. They are potential
war criminals and should be treated as such. In Nuremberg,
Germany, a score of Nazi leaders were hanged for doing pre-
cisely what the Hearsts, McCormicks, Byrnes’, Bullitts, Earles,
Winchells, and others are now proposing openly. '

The representatives of the U.S.S.R. and other nations in the
U.N. were not hasty in raising their charges, of warmongering,
as the campaign has been goingon with increasing volume
ever since -the end of the war. These representatives were also
restrained in naming the warmongers, and could well have
added President Truman to their list. For not only has he
made no criticism of the warmongers, but he has added fuel
to their ﬁre by his own many jingoistic speeches.

The most dangerous part of the current warmongering is
that much of it comes from conservative and Social-Demo-
cratic labor leaders. Dubinsky, Woll, Reuther, Carey, and

5

-other union officials seem determined to outdo the capitalists
.themselves in their eagerness for an American-Soviet war.

Organizing for War

»Not only are the reactionaries violently advocating war
;against the U.S.S.R. but they are furiously preparing for such
.a war. These preparations are going on on a huge scale and in
:many parts of the world, as a few examples will show.

The Federal Government, Congress as well as the Truman
Administration, is now under the dictation of such Wal1,Street
..agents, imperialists and get-tough-with-Russia elements as
Hoover, Dulles, Vandenberg, Forrestal and Harriman. Their
program is an anti-Soviet war, as soon as possible.

The State Department has been turned over to a General,
and this department, and various others, as the diplomatic
service generally, is loaded with military men, as never before.
Powerful forces also want to have a military President, General
Eisenhower. Senator Taylor says the army practically belongs
to Wall Street. This" militarization of the Government is a
-dangerous war trend.

United States policy in the United Nations is obviously to
by-pass_ that body on important questions (intervention in
-Greece and China, the Marshall Plan in Europe, MacArthur’s

activities in Japan, etc.) and to transform the U.N. into an
.anti-Soviet military alliance. '

The Federal military budget for 1948 is 121/2 billion dollars,
far and away the largest in our peace-time’ history.‘ It is 15
times as large as in 1936. '

In July, 1947, the Army, Navy and Airforce were combined
under one head, the Wall Street imperialist, Secretary James
V. Forrestal. Not even during the war did the Government so
tightly centralize its armed forces.

The United States continues piling up atom bombs; it has

; a navy bigger than all the navies of the rest of the world; the

Russians claim the American Army is the strongest in the

-world, and energetic efforts are being made to introduce uni-
~versal compulsory military training. Many scientists, includ-

 

 

ing ioo Nazi specialists, are busily at work perfecting rocket
bombs, germ bombs and other super-dreadful weapons.

The United States has, or is building, powerful military air
bases in many parts of the world, including Greenland, Labra-
dor, Iceland, Bermuda, Azores, Brazil, Paraguay, the Near
East, Pakistan, the Aleutian Islands, the Japanese Islands,
Canada, the Arctic and Antarctic, etc. The general strategic
plan behind this world network of air bases is a sudden, all-
out atomic-bomb, -airplane attack upon the U.S.S.R.

The Government has also worked out plans for the speedy
and complete war mobilization of the basic industries on a
far greater scale than was achieved during World War II. '

A major war preparation, too, is the so-called standardiza-
tion of arms agreements of the United States with Great
Britain, Canada and the Latin American countries. This
would virtually place the armed forces of these countries under
the control of the United States. It would also provide almost
a monopoly for American munitions manufacturers.

The warmongers are feverishly preparing the masses of the
American people ideologically for war. They are deluging
them with Red-baiting and Soviet-hating. They have devel-
oped a big war scare in order to make the -people believe that
war is, both imminent and inevitable. Under cover of this war
scare they are militarizing the country and putting across their
general program of fascist-like reaction, of which the Taft-
Hartley law is but one example.

These and other developments’. constitute a formidable
mobilization of the industrial, military and human forces of
the United States and its allies for Wall Street's contemplated
war against the Soviet Union and other democratic nations.

Actively Waging War

The Wall Street warmongers and imperialists are also pre-
paring for war by developing reactionary allies in various
parts of the world. Their general line of policy is to break
up the peace forces in the various ‘lands and to build up re-
actionary groupings, with the objective of dominating these
countries’ governments and of enlisting them in its projected

7

  

 

 

 

war against the U.S.S.R. Wall Street's weapons in this im-
perialist drive are atom-bomb diplomacy, the political manip-
ulation of food and ﬁnancial loans, and the use of armed
force. These preparations have reached the point of actual
civil war in several countries.

In France, Italy and Chile, in order to lay a war basis, State
Department agents have forced the expulsion of Communists
from the government Cabinets. All over Europe, similarly
striving to undermine democracy, they are working to shatter
the growing Communist-Socialist unity. Also, with the help
of A. F. of L. bureaucrats, they are trying to wreck the trade
union movements of Latin America and Europe. The con-
servative New York Post (Oct. 17) boasts that “A. F. of_L.
money and men are going to Europe to work for anti-Com-
munist unions and to help break up the World Federation of
Trade Unions.” The A. F. of L. maintains a special office in
Paris to cultivate disruption in the progressive French Con-
federation of Labor.

American food reserves are also being used far and wide
among famished peoples in order to coerce the peace-loving
forces and to secure control over their governments. For ex-
ample, of the many hundreds of millions of dollars. sent to
China by U.N.R.R.A. only 2 per cent reached the liberated
areas under Communist leadership, which contain one-third
of the total population of China and which were the worst
devastated by the Japanese.

American loans are being widely used for the same warlike,
imperialist purposes. Democratic, peace-loving countries are
systematically refused loans, but those bowing to Wall Street
get lots of money. This is the very heart of the so-called
Marshall Plan. The conservative James P. Warburg (United
Press; Oct. 21) says: “We seem at times bent on attaching such
political strings to economic aid as would force other peoples
to remodel themselves on the American image.” The N. Y.
Herald-Tribune (Oct. 14) states: “Various means are em-
ployed to carry it [American policy in Europe] out. One is to
encourage n-on-Communist elements. The other is to withhold
ﬁnancial credits from governments which are or appear to be
Communist-controlled.” And on Oct. 18 (United Press), Sen-
8

 

 

ator H. Styles Bridges, with brutal imperialist frankness,
“disclosed that he had served notice on Prime Minister Paul
Ramadier that American aid depended on whether France
crushes Communism and stops the strikes the Communists
provoke.”

The present so-called Marshall Plan of giving big loans to
the countries of Western Europe is a Wall Street imperialist
scheme to weaken the peace-loving democratic forces in these
countries, to secure control over their governments, and to
build a Western European military bloc against the Soviet
Union. \

Along with these imperialist methods of food and ﬁnancial
coercion, Wall Street government representatives encourage
and support the use of armed force against the democratic
and peace-loving forces and governments. In Latin America, a
reign of violence against the labor unions and advanced politi-
cal parties is now being provoked by State Department agents,
and in Europe every band of fascist adventurers and capitalist
plotters can depend upon American support in every attack
they make against democracy, however violent. Thus, in vio-
lent contradiction to our national interests, our country is
placed by Wall Street agents in the disgraceful role of being
the chief organizer of world reaction and of civil war. If,
today, for example, the fascist General de Gaulle is mak-
ing dangerous headway and actually threatening France
with civil war, a major part of the responsibility rests with
Wall Street. The latter wants to make a military puppet of
France, and de Gaulle serves its purpose.

Wall Street policy (the Marshall Plan) in Germany is to
rebuild that country’s industry, put -the monopolists back into:
control, ease the fascists into government power, make the
country dependent upon the United States, and prepare it for
war against the U.S.S.R. As we have seen, Mr. Byrnes boldly
demands such a war.

In Greece, American food, funds and guns are being used on
a huge scale -to smash the democratic, peace-loving Greek
people, to keep in power the war-like near-fascist Royalist
Government, to wage civil war. Now «there is talk, too, of
sending American troops. The general idea behind this out-
