    

ism, social-chauvinism, and bourgeois distortion of Socialism and
set out to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this
manner the Communist International continues the glorious and
heroic_traditions of the international labor movement; of the En-
glish Chartists and the French insurrectionists of 1831; of the
French and German working class revolutionaries of 1848; of
the immortal warriors and martyrs of the Paris Commune; of the
valiant soldiers of the German, Hungarian and Finnish revolu-
tions; of the workers under the former tsarist despotism——the
victorious hearers of the proletarian dictatorship; of the Chinese
proletarians—the heroes of Canton and Shanghai.

Basing itself on the experience of the revolutionary labor move-
ment on all continents and of all peoples, the Communist Inter-
national, in its theoretical and practical work, stands wholly and
unreservedly upon the ground of revolutionary Marxism and its
further development, Leninism, which is nothing else but Marx-
ism of the epoch of imperialism and proletarian revolution.

Advocating and propagating the dialectical materialism of
Marx and Engels and employing it as a revolutionary method of
conceiving reality, with the view to the revolutionary transforma-
tion of this reality, the Communist International wages an active

struggle against all forms of bourgeois philosophy and against_
_ all forms of theoretical and practical opportunism. '

Standing
on the ground of consistent proletarian class struggle and subordi-
nating the temporary, partial, group and national interests of
the proletariat to its lasting, general, international interests, the
Communist International mercilessly exposes all forms of the
doctrine of “class peace” that the reformists have accepted from

the bourgeosie. Expressing the historical need for an international ,

organization of revolutionary proletarians——the grave-diggers of
the capitalist order—the Communist International is the only
international force that has for its program the dictatorship of
the proletariat and Communism, and that openly comes out as the
organizer of the international proletarian revolution.

I. The World System of Capitalism, Its Development
and Inevitable ‘Downfall

1. THE DYNAMIC LAWS OF CAPITALISM AND THE EPOCH OF
INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL

THE characteristic features of capitalist society which arose
on the basis‘ of commodity production are the monopoly of
they most important and vital means of production by the capi-
talist class and ‘big landlords; the exploitation of the wage labor
of the proletariat, which, being deprived of the means of produc-
tion, is compelled to sell its labor’ power; the production of com-
modities for proﬁt and, linked up with all this, the planless and
anarchic character of the process of production as a whole. Ex-
ploitation relationships and the economic domination of the bour-
geoisie and their political expression in the organized capitalist
State—the instrument for the suppression of the proletariat.

The history of capitalism has entirely conﬁrmed the theories
of Marx and Engels concerning the laws of development of
capitalist society and concerning the contradictions of this de-
velopment that must inevitably lead to ‘the downfall of the whole
capitalist system.

In its quest for proﬁtsthe bourgeoisie was compelled to develop
the productive forces on an ever-increasing scale and to strengthen
and expand the domination of capitalist relationships of produc-
tion. Thus, the. development of capitalism constantly reproduces
on a wider scale all the inherent contradictions of the capitalist
system, primarily, the vital contradiction between the social char-
acter of labor and private acquisition, between the growth of the
productive forces and the property relations of capitalism. The
predominance of private property in the means of production and
the anarchy prevailing in the process of production have dis-

9

 

  

turbed the equilibrium between the various branches of produc-
tion; for a growing contradiction developed between the tendency
towards unlimited expansion of production and the restricted
consumption of the masses of the proletariat (general over-pro-
duction), and this resulted in periodical devastating crises and
mass unemployment among the proletariat. The predominance
of private property also found expression in the competition that
prevailed in each separate capitalist country as well as on the
constantly expanding world market. This latter form of capi-
talist rivalry resulted in a number of wars, which are the inevit-
able accompaniment of capitalist development. »

On the other hand, the technical and economic advantages of
mass production have resulted in the squeezing out and destruc-

 

tion in the competitive struggle of the pre-capitalist economics

forms and in the ever-increasing concentration and centralization
of capital. In the sphere of industry this law of concentration
and centralization of capital manifested itself primarily in the
directlruin of small enterprises and partly in their being‘ reduced
to the position of auxiliary units of large enterprises. In the
domain of agriculture which, owing to the existence of the mon-

opoly in land and absolute rent, must inevitably lag behind the

general rate of development, this law not only found expression
in the process of differentiation that took place among the peas-
antry and in the proletarianization. of broad strata of the latter,
but also and mainly in the open and concealed subordination of
small peasant economy to the domination of big capital; small
farming has been able to maintain a nominal independence only
at the price of extreme intensiﬁcation of labor and systematic
under-consumption.

The ever-growing application of machinery, the constant im-
provements in technics and, consequently, the uninterrupted rise
in the organic composition of capital, accompanied by still further.
division, increased productivity and intensity of labor, meant also
increased employment of female and child labor, the formation

of enormous industrial reserve armies which arefconstantly replen-

10

  

ished by the proletarianized peasantry who are forced to leave '

their villages as well as by the ruined small and middle urban
bourgeoisie. The collection of a handful of capitalist magnates
at one pole of social relationships and of a gigantic mass of the
proletariat at the other; the constantly increasing rate of exploita-
tion of the working "class, the reproduction on a wider scale of
the deepest contradictions of capitalism and their consequences
(crises, wars, etc.); the constant growth of social inequality, the
rising discontent of the proletariat united and schooled by the
mechanism of capitalist production itsel£—all this has inevitably
undermined the foundations of capitalism and has brought nearer
the day of its collapse.

Simultaneously, a profound change has taken place in the
social and cultural life of capitalist society; the parasitical de-
cadence of the rentier group of the bourgeoisie; the break up of
the family, which expresses the growing contradiction between
the mass participation of women in social‘ production and the
forms of family and domestic life largely inherited from previous
economic epochs; the growing shallowness and degeneracy of cul-
tural and ideological life resulting from the minute specializa-
tion of labor, the monstrous forms of urban life and the restricted-
ness of rural life; the incapability of the bourgeoisie, notwith-
standing the enormous achievements of the natural sciences, to
create a synthetically scientiﬁc philosophy, and the growth of
ideological, mystical and religious superstition, are all phenomena
signalizing the approach of the historical end of the capitalist
system. -

2. THE ERA OF FINANCE CAPITAL (IMPERIALISM)

The period of industrial capitalism was, in the main, a period
of “free competition”; a period of a steady development and ex-
pansion of capitalism throughout the whole world, when the as yet
unoccupied colonies were being divided up and conquered by
armed force; a period of continuous growth of the inherent con-
tradictions of capitalism, the burden of which fell mainly upon

11

  

the systematically plundered, crushed and oppressed colonial
periphery. 4

Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, this period

‘ .was replaced by the period of imperialism, during which capi-

    

talism developed spasmodically and conflictingly; free competi-
tion rapidly gave way to monopoly, the previously “available”
colonial lands were all divided up, and the struggle for a re-
distribution of colonies and spheres of inﬂuence inevitably began
to assume primarily the form of a struggle by force of arms.

. Thus, the entire scope and truly world-wide scale of the con-
tradictions of capitalism become must glaringly revealed in the
epoch of imperialism (ﬁnance capitalism), which, from the histori-
cal standpoint, signiﬁes a new form of capitalism, a new system
of relationship between the various parts of world capitalist
economy and a change in the relationship between the principal
classes of capitalist society.

This new historical period set in as a result of the operation
of the principal dynamic laws of capitalist society. It grew out
of the development of industrial capitalism, and is the historical
continuation of the latter. It sharpened the manifestations of
all the fundamental tendencies and dynamic laws of capitalist
development, of all its fundamental tendencies and dynamic laws
of capitalist development, of all its fundamental contradictions
and antagonisms. The law of the concentration and centraliza-
tion of capital led to the formation of powerful combines (cartels,
syndicates, trusts), to new forms of gigantic combinations of en-
terprises linked up into one system by the banks. The merging
of industrial capital with banking capital, the absorption of big

 

land ownership into the general system of capitalist organization,"

and the monopolistic character of this form of capitalism trans-
formed the epoch of industrial capital into the epoch of finance
capital. “Free competition” of the period of industrial capitalism,
which replaced feudal monopoly and the monopoly of merchant

capital, became itself transformed into ﬁnance-capital monopoly. -

At the same time, although capitalistic organizations grow out of
12

free competition, they do not eliminate competition, but exist
side by side with and hover over it, and thus give rise to a series
of exceptionally great and acute contradictions, frictions and con-
Hicts. '

The growing application of complex machinery, of chemical
processes and of electric energy; the resulting higher organic com-
position of capital and, consequently, decline in the rate of proﬁt,
which only the biggest monopolisticcombines are able to counter-
act for a time by their policy of high cartel prices, still further
stimulate the quest for colonial super-proﬁts and the struggle for
a new division of the world. Standardized mass production
creates the demand for new foreign markets. The growing de-
mand for raw materials and fuel intensiﬁes the race for their

sources. Lastly, the system of high protection, which hinders.

the export of merchandise and secures additional proﬁt for ex-
ported capital, creates additional stimuli for the export of capital.
Export of capital becomes, therefore, ‘the decisive and speciﬁc
form of economic contact between the various parts of world
capitalist economy. The total eifect of all this is that the mon-
opolist ownership of colonial markets, of sources‘ of raw materials,
and of spheres of investment of capital extremely accentuates the
general unevenness iof capital development and sharpness the
conflicts between the “great powers” of ﬁnance capital over the
redistribution of the colonies and spheres of influence.

The growth of -the productive forces of world economy thus
leads to the further internationalization of economic life and
simultaneously leads to a struggle for redistribution of the world,
already divided up among the biggest ﬁnance capital States, to
a change in and sharpening of ‘the forms of this struggle and to
the method of forcing down prices, being superseded to an in-
creasing degree by the method of forcible pressure (boycott, high
protection, tariff wars, wars proper, etc.). Consequently, the
monopolistic form of capitalism is inevitably accompanied by im-
perialist wais, which, by the area they embrace and the destructive-

, ness of their technique, have no parallel in world history.

13_

    

     

3. THE FORCES OF IMPERIALISM AND THE FORCES OF REVOLUTION

Expressing the tendency for uniﬁcation of the various sections
of the dominant class, the imperialist form of capitalism places
the broad masses of the proletariat in opposition, not to a single
employer, but, to an increasing degree, to the capitalist class as a
whole and to the capitalist State. On the other hand, this form
of capitalism breaks down‘ the national barriers that have become
too restricted for it, widens the scope of the capitalist State power
of the dominant Great Power and brings it in opposition to vast
masses of nationally oppressed peoples in the so-called small na-
tions as well as in the colonies. Finally, this form of capitalism
brings the imperialist States .most sharply in opposition to each
other.

This being the case, State power, which is becoming the dic-
tatorship of the ﬁnance-capitalist oligarchy and the expression of
its. concentrated might, acquires special significance for the «bour-
geoisie. The functions of this multi-national imperialist State
grow in all directions. The development of State capitalist forms,

which facilitate the struggle in foreign markets (mobilization of.

industry’ for war purposes) as well as the struggle against the
working class; the monstrous growth of militarism (armies, naval
and air fleets, and the employment of chemistry and bacteriology);
the increasing pressure of -the imperialist State upon the work-
ing class (the growth of exploitation and direct suppression of
the workers on the one hand and the systematic policy of bribing
the bureaucratic reformist leadership on the other), all this ex-
presses the enormous growth of the power of the State. Under
these circumstances, every more or less important action of the
proletariat becomes transformed into an action against the State
power, i.e., into political action.

Hence the‘ development of capitalism, and particularly the im-
perialist epoch of its development, reproduces the fundamental
contradictions of capitalism on an increasingly magniﬁed scale.
Competition among small capitalists ceases, only to make way for
competition among big capitalists; where competition among big
14

capitalists subsides, it ﬂares up between gigantic combinations of
capitalist magnates and their governments; local and national
crises become transformed into crises affecting a number of coun-
tries and, subsequently, into world crises; local wars give way to
wars between coalitions of States and to world wars; the class
struggles changes from isolated actions of single groups of work-
ers into nation-wide conflicts and subsequently, into an interna-

. tional struggle of the world proletariat against the world bour-

geoisie. Finally, two main revolutionary forces are organizing
against the organized might of ﬁnance capital.—on the one hand
the workers in the capitalist States, on the other hand, the victims
of the oppression of foreign capital, the masses of the people in
the colonies, marching under the leadership and the hegemony of
the international revolutionary proletarian movement.

However, this fundamental revolutionary tendency is tempo-
rarily paralyzed by the fact that certain sections of the European,
North American and Japanese proletariat are bribed by the im-
perialist bourgeoisie, and by the treachery of the national bour-
geoisie in the semi-colonial and colonial countries who are fright-
ened by the revolutionary mass movement. The bourgeoisie of im-
perialist countries, which is able to secure additional surplus
proﬁts from the position it holdsin the world market (more
developed technique, export ofi capital to countries with a higher
rate of profit, etc.), and from the proceeds of its plunder of the
colonies and semi-colonies—was able to raise the wages of its
"own” workers out of the surplus proﬁts, thus giving these work-
ers an interest in the development of “home” capitalism, in the
plunder of the colonies and in being loyal to the imperialist State.

This systematic bribery was and is being very widely practiced
in the most powerful imperialist countries and finds most strik-
ing expression in the ideology and practice of the labor aristocracy
and the bureaucratic strata of the working class, i.e., the social-
democratic and trade union leaders, who proved to be the direct
agencies ofbourgeois inﬂuence among the proletariat and stalwart
pillars of the capitalist system. “

15‘

    

By stimulating the growth of the corrupt upper stratum of the
working class, however, imperialism in the end destroys its in-
ﬂuence upon the working class, because the growing contradictions
of imperialism, the worsening of the conditions of the broad masses
of the workers, the mass unemployment among the proletariat,
the enormous cost of military conﬂicts and the burdens they
entail, the fact that certain powers have lost their monopolistic
position in the world market, the break-away of the colonies, etc.,
serve to undermine the basis of social democracy among the

masses. Similarly, the systematic bribery of the various sections‘

of the bourgeoisie in the colonies and semi-colonies, their be-
trayal of the national-revolutionary movement and their rap-
prochement with the imperialist powers can paralyze the develop-
ment of the revolutionary crisis only for a time. In the final
analysis, this leads to the intensiﬁcation of imperialist oppression,
to the decline of the inﬂuence of the national bourgeoisie upon
the masses of the people, to the sharpening of the revolutionary
crisis, to the unleashing of the agrarian revolution of the broad
masses of the peasantry and to the creation of conditions favorable
for the establishment of the hegemony of the proletariat in the
colonies and dependencies in the popular mass struggle for in-
dependence and complete national liberation.

4. IMPERIALISM AND THE DOWNFALL OF CAPITALISM

Imperialism has greatly developed the productive forces" of
world capitalism. It has completed the preparation of all the
material prerequisites for the Socialist organization of society.
By its wars it has demonstrated that the productive forces of
world-economy, "which have outgrown the restricted boundaries
of imperialist States, demand the organization of economy on a
world, or international scale. Imperialism tries to remove this
contradiction by hacking a road with fire and sword towards a

single world State-capitalist trust, which is. to organize the whole »

world economy. This sanguinary utopia is being extolled by the
social-democratic ideologists as a peaceful method of newly “or-
ganized” capitalism.. In reality, this utopia encounters insur-

16

    

mountable objective obstacles of such magnitude that capitalism.

must .inevitably fall beneath the weight of its own contradictions.
The law of uneven development of capitalism, which becomes
intensiﬁed in the epoch of imperialism, renders ﬁrm and durable
international combinations of imperialist powers impossible. On
the other hand, imperialist wars, which are developing into world
wars, and by which the law of the centralization of capitalism
strives to reach its world limit—a single world trust—-are accom-
panied by’ so much destruction and placesuch burdens upon the
shoulders of the working class and of the millions of colonial

proletarians and peasants, that capitalism must inevitably perish '.

beneath the blows of the proletarian revolution long before this
goal is reached.

Being the highest phase of capitalist development, developing
the productive forces of world economy to enormous dimensions
refashioning the whole world after its own image, imperialism
draws within the orbit of ﬁnance-capitalist exploitation all col-
onies, all races and all nations. At the same time, however, the
monopolistic form of capital increasingly develops the elements
of parasitical degeneration, decay and decline of capitalism. By
destroying, to some extent, the driving force of competition, by
conducting a pﬁcy of cartel prices, and by having undivided
mastery of the market, monopoly capital reveals a tendency to
retard the further development of the forces of production. In
squeezing enormous‘sums of surplus proﬁts out of the millions
of colonial workers and peasants and in accumulating colossal in-
comes from this exploitation, imperialism is creating a type of
decaying and parasitically degenerate rentier-class, as well as

whole strata of parasites who live by clipping coupons.‘ While _

completing the process of creating‘ the material prerequisites for
Socialism (the concentration of means of production, the enorm-
ous socialization of labor, the growth of labor organizations), the
epoch of imperialism intensiﬁes the antagonisms among the “Great
Powers” and gives rise to wars which cause the break-up of single
world economy. Imperialism is therefore moribund and decaying

II. The General Crisis of Capitalism and the First
Phase of World Revolution

1. THE WORLD \VAR AND THE PROGRESS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY
CRISIS

HE imperialist struggle among the largest capitalist States

for the redistribution of the globe led to the first imperialist
world .war (1914-1918). This war shook the whole system of
world capitalism and marked the beginning of the period of its
general crisis." It bent to its service the entire national economy
of the belligerent countries, thus creating the mailed fist of State
capitalism; it increased unproductive expenditures to enormous
dimensions, destroyed enormous quantities of the means of pro-
duction and human labor power, ruined large masses of the
population and imposed incalculable burdens upon the industrial
workers, the_peasants and the colonial peoples. It inevitably led
tow’ the intensification of the class struggle, which grew into open
revolutionary mass action and civil war.‘ The imperialist front
was broken at its weakest link, in Tsarist Russia. The February
revolution of 1917 overthrew the domination of the autocracy of
the big land-owning class. The October revolution overthrew
the rule ‘of the bourgeoisie. This victorious proletarian revolu-
tion expropriated the expropriators, took the means of produc-
tion from the landlords and the capitalists, and for the first time
in human history set up and consolidated the dictatorship of the
proletariat in an enormous country, brought into being a new,
Soviet type of State and laid ‘the foundations for the/ interna-
tional proletarian revolution.

The powerful shock to which the whole of world capitalism
was subjected, the sharpening of the class struggle and the direct
influence of the October proletarian revolution gave rise to a
series of revolutions and revolutionary actions on the Continent

19

    

of Europe as well as in the colonial and semi-colonial countries;
January, 1918, the proletarian. revolution in Finland; August,
1918, the so-called “rice-riots” in Japan; November, 1918, the
revolutions in Austria and Germany, which overthrew the semi-
feudal monarchist regime; March, 1919, the proletarian revolu-
tion in Hungary and the uprising in Korea; April, 1919, the Sov-
iet Government in Bavaria; January, 1920, the bourgeois-national
revolution in Turkey; September, 1920, the seizure of the factories
by the workers in Italy; March, 1921, the rising of the advanced

workers of Germany; September, 1923, the uprising in Bulgaria;_

Autumn, 1923, the revolutionary crisis in Germany; December,
1924, the uprising in Estonia; April, 1925, the uprising in Moroc-

co; August, 1925, uprising in Syria; May, 1926, the general strike ‘

in England; July, 1927, the proletarian uprising in Vienna. These
events, as well as events like the uprising in Indonesia, the deep
ferment in India, the great Chinese revolution, which shook the
whole Asiatic continent, are links in one and the same interna-
tional revolutionary chain, constituent parts of the profound gen-
eral crisis of capitalism. This international revolutionary process
embraced the immediate struggle for the dictatorship of the pro-
letariat, as well as national wars of liberation and colonial up-
risings against imperialism, which inseparably go together with
the agrarian mass movement of millions of peasants. Thus, an
enormous mass of humanity was swept into the revolutionary tor-
rent. World history entered a new phase of development—a
phase of prolonged general crisis of the capitalist system. In this
process, the unity of world economy found expression in the
international character of the revolution, while the uneven develop-
ment of its separate parts was expressed in the absence of simul-
taneity in the outbreak of revolution in the different countries.
The first attempts at revolutionary overthrow, which sprang
from the acute crisis of capitalism (.1918-1921) ended in the vic-
tory and consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat in
the U.S.S.R. and in the defeat of the proletariat in a number of
other countries. These defeats were primarily due to the treach-
erous tactics of the social democratic and reformist. trade union

20

 
   

leaders, but they were also due to the fact that the majority
of the working class had not yet accepted the lead of the Com-
munists and that in a number of important countries Commu-
nist Parties had not yet been established at all. As a result of
these defeats, which created the opportunity for intensifying the
exploitation of the mass of the proletariat and the colonial peoples,
and for severely depressing their standard of living, the bour-
geoisie was able to achieve a partial stabilization’ of capitalist
relations.

2. THE REVOLUTIONARY CRISIS AND COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY
SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY

During the progress of the international revolution, the lead-
ing cadres of the social-democratic parties and of the reformist
trade unions on the one hand, and the militant capitalist organiza-
tions of the fascist type on the other, acquired special signiﬁcance
as a powerful counter-revolutionary force actively ﬁghting against
the revolution and actively supporting the partial stabilization of
capitalism.

The war crisis of 1914-1918 was accompanied by the disgrace-
ful collapse of the social-dem_ocratic Second International. Acting
incomplete violation of the thesis of the Communist Manifesto
written by Marx and Engels, that thevproletariat has no father-
land under capitalism and in complete violation of the anti-war
resolutions passed by the Stuttgart and Basel Congresses, the
leaders of the social-democratic parties in the various countries,
with a few exceptions, voted for the war credits, came out de-
ﬁnitely in defense of the «imperialist “fatherland” (i.e., the State
organizations of the imperialist bourgeoisie) and instead of com-
batting the imperialist war, became its loyal soldiers, bards and
propagandists _(social-patriotism, which grew into social-imperial-
ism). In the subsequent period, social democracy supported the
predatory treaties (Brest-Litovsk, Versailles); it actively aligned
itself with the militarists in the bloody suppression of proletarian
uprisings (Noske) ; it conducted armed warfare against the first

21

  

proletarian republic (Soviet Russia); it clespica-bly betrayed the
victorious proletariat (Hungary); it joined the imperialist League
of Nations (Albert Thomas, Paul Boncour, Vandervelde); it
openly supported the imperialist slave-owners against the colonial
slaves (the British Labor Party); it actively supported the most
reactionary executioners of the working class (Bulgaria, Poland);
it took upon itself the initiative in securing the passage of impe-
rialist “military laws” (France); it betrayed the general strike
of the British proletariat; (it helped and is still helping to strangle
China and India (the MacDonald government); it acts as the
propagandist for the imperialist ‘League of Nations; it is capital’s
herald and organizer of the struggle against the dictatorship of
the proletariat in the U.S.S.R. (Kautsky, I-Iilferding).

In its systematic conduct of this counter-revolutionary policy,
social-democracy operates on two ﬂanks; the right wing of social
democracy, avowedly counter-revolutionary, is essential for nego-
tiating and maintaining direct contact with the bourgeoisie; the
left wing is essential for the subtle deception of the workers.
While playing with pacifist and at times even with revolutionary
phrases, “left wing” social democracy in practice act against the
workers, particularly in acute and critical situations (the British
I.L.P. and the “left” leaders of the‘ General Council during the
general strike in 1926; Otto Bauer and Co., at the time of the
Vienna uprising), and is therefore, the most dangerous faction
in the social-democratic parties. While serving the interests of
the bourgeoisie in the working class and being wholly in favor of

class cooperation and coalition with the bourgeosie, social democ-

    

racy, at certain periods, is compelled to play‘ the part of an oppo-
sition party and even to pretend that it is defending the class
interests of the proletariat in its industrial struggle, in order there-
by to win the conﬁdence ‘of a section of the working class and
to be in a position more shamefully to betray the lasting interests
of the working class, particularly in the midst of decisive class
battles.

The principal function of social democracy at the present time

22

 

is to disrupt the essential militant unity of the proletariat in its
struggle against imperialism. In splitting and disrupting‘ the
united front of the proletarian struggle against capital, social
democracy serves as the mainstay of imperialism in the working
class. International social democracy of all shades; the Second
International and its trade union branch, the Amsterdam Federa-
tion of Trade Unions, have thus become the last reserve of bour-
geois society and its most reliable pillar of support.

3. THE CRISIS OF CAPITALISM AND FASCISM

Side by side with social democracy‘, with whose aid the bour-
geoisie suppresses the workers or lulls their class vigilance, stands
Fascism. ‘

The epoch of imperialism, the sharpening of the class strug-
gle and the growth of the elements of civil war-particularly

after the imperialist war—led to the bankruptcy of parliamentar- _

ism. Hence, the adoption of “new” methods and forms of
administration (for example, the system of inner cabinets, ‘the
formation of oligarchical groups, acting behind the scenes, the
deterioration and falsiﬁcation of the function of “popular repre-
sentation,” the restriction and annulment of “democratic liberties,”
etc.) . Under certain special historical conditions, the progress of
this bourgeois, reactionary offensive assumes the form of Fascism.
These conditions are: instability of capitalist relationships; the
existence of a considerable declassed social element, the pauperiza—
tion of broad strata of the urban petty bourgeoisie and of the in-
telligentsia; discontent among the rural petty bourgeosie and,
ﬁnally, the constant menace of mass proletarian action. In order
to stabilize and perpetuate its rule, the bourgeoisie is compelled
to an increasing degree to abandon the parliamentary system in
favor of the fascist system, which is independent of inter-party
arrangements and combinations. The fascist system is a system of
direct dictatorship, ideologically masked by the “national idea” and
representation of the “professions” (in reality, representation of
the various groups of the ruling class). It is a system that resorts

23

    

  

to a peculiar form of social demagogy (anti-semitism, occasional
sorties against usurers’ capital and gestures of impatience with the
parliamentary “talking shop”) in order to utilize the discontent of
the petty bourgeoisie, the intellectuals and other strata of society,
and to corruption——the creation of a compact and well paid hier-
archy of fascist units, a party apparatus and a bureaucracy. At
the same time, Fascism strives to permeate the working class by
recruiting the most backward strata of workers to its ranks, by
playing upon their discontent, by taking advantage of the inaction
of social democracy, etc. .T he principal aim of Fascism is to de-
stroy the revolutionary labor vanguard, i.e., the Communist Sec-
tions and leading units of the proletariat. The combination of
social democracy, corruption and active white terror, in conjunction
with extreme imperialist aggression in the sphere of foreign
politics, are the characteristic features of Fascism. In periods
of acute crisis for the bourgeoisie, Fascism resorts to anti-capi-
talist phraseology, but after it has established itself at the helm
of State, it casts aside its anti-capialist rattle and discloses itself
as a terrorist dictatorship of big capital. A

The bourgeoisie resorts either to the method of Fascism or
to the method of coalition with social democracy according to
the changes in the political situation; while social democracy itself
often plays a fascist role in periods when the situation is critical
for capitalism.

In the process of development social democracy reveals fas-
cist tendencies which, however, does prevent it, in other political
situations, from acting as a sort of Fronde against the bourgeois

government in, the capacity of an opposition party. The fascist
method and the method of coalition with social democracy, are
not the methods usually employed in “normal” capitalist condi-
tions; they are the symptoms of the general capitalist crisis, and
are employed by the bourgeoisie in order to stem. the advance of
the revolution.

4. THE CONTRADICTIONS OF CAPITALIST STABILIZATION AND
' THE INEVITABILITY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COLLAPSE
OF ‘CAPITALISM

Experience throughout the post-war historical period has‘ shown
that the stabilization achieved by the repression of the working
class and the systematic depression of its standard of living can
be only a partial, transient and decaying stabilization.

The spasmodic and feverish development of technics border-‘
‘ ing in some countries on a new technical revolution, the accelerated

process of concentration and centralization of capital, the forma-
tion of giant trusts and of "national” and “international” mon-
opolies, the merging of trusts with the State power and the
growth of world capitalist economy carmot, however, eliminate
the general crisis of the capitalist system. The break-up of world
economy into a capitalist and a Socialist sector, the shrinking of
markets and the anti-imperialist movement in the colonies in-
tensify all the contradictions of capitalism, which is developing on
a new, post-war basis. This very technical progress and ration-
alization of industry, the reverse side of which is the closing down
and liquidation of numerous enterprises, the restriction of produc-
tion, andthe ruthless and destructive exploitation of labor power,
leads to chronic unemployment on a scale never before experi-
enced. The absolute deterioration of the conditions of the work-
ing class ‘becomes a fact even in certain highly. developed capi-
talist countries. The growing competition between imperialist
countries, the constant menace of war and the growing intensity
of classconﬂicts prepare the ground for a new and higher stage
of development of the general crisis of capitalism and of the
world proletarian revolution. ‘

As a result of the first round.of imperialist wars (the world
war of 1914-1918) and of the October victory of the working
class in the former Russian Tsarist empire, world economy has
been split into two fundamentally hostile camps: the camp of
the imperialist States and the camp of the dictatorship of the

25

 
 

proletariat in the U.S.S.R. The difference in class structure and
in the class character of the government in the two camps, the
fundamental differences in the aims each pursues in internal,
foreign, economic and cultural policy, the fundamentally different
courses of their development, brings the capitalist world into
sharp conflict with the victorious proletarian State. Within the
framework of a formerly uniform world economy, two antag-
onistic systems are now contesting against each other: the system
of capitalism and the system of Socialism. The class struggle,
which hitherto was conducted in forms under which the proleta-
riat ‘was not in possession of State power, is now being conducted
on an enormous and really world scale; the working class of the
world has now its own State——the one and only fatherland of the
international proletariat. The existence of the Soviet Union and

i the inﬂuence it exercises upon the toiling and oppressed masses

    

all over the world is in itself a most striking expression of the
profound crisis of the world capitalist system and of the expan-
sion and intensiﬁcation of the class struggle to a degree hitherto
without parallel in history. i

The capitalist world, powerless to eliminate its inherent con-
tradictions, strives to establish international associations (the
League of Nations) the main purpose of which is to retard the
irresistible growth of the revolutionary crisis and to strangle the
Soviet proletarian republics by war or blockade. At the same time,
all the ‘forces of’ the revolutionary proletariat and of the op-
pressed colonial masses are rallying around the U.S.S.R. The
world coalition of Capital, unstable, internally corroded, but
armed to the teeth, is confronted by a single world coalition of
Labor. Thus, as a result of the first round of i_mperialist wars
a new, fundamental antagonism has "arisen of world historical

 

scope and significance; the antagonism between» the U.S.S.R. and I

the capitalist world.

Meanwhile, the inherent antagonisms within the capitalist
sector of world economy itself have become intensiﬁed. The
shifting of the economic centre of the world to the United States

26'

S of America and the fact of the “Dollar Republic” having become

a world exploiter have ‘caused the relations between United States
and European capitalism, particularly British capitalism, to be-
come strained. The conflict between Great Britain—the most
powerful of the old, conservative imperialist States-—and the
United iStates—the greatest of the young imperialist States, which
has already won world hegemony for itself,-— is becoming the
pivot of the world conﬂicts among the ﬁnance capitalist States.
Germany, though plundered by the Versailles Peace, is now
economically recovered; she is resuming the path of imperialist
politics, and once again she stands out as a serious competitor
in the world market. The Paciﬁc is becoming involved in a tangle
of contradictions which center mainly around the antagonism.
between America and Japan. Simultaneously, the antagonism of
interests among the unstable and constantly changing groupings
of powers is increasing, while the minor powers serve as the,
auxiliary instruments in the hands of the imperialist giants and
their coalitions. ,

The growth of the productive capacity of the industrial ap-
paratus of world capitalism, at a time when the European home
markets have shrunk as a result of. the war, as the result of
the Soviet Union’s dropping out of the system of‘ purely capi-
talist intercourse and of the close monopoly of the ‘most im-
portant sources of raw material and fuel, leads to ever-widening
conflicts between ‘the capitalist States. The "peaceful” struggle
for oil, rubber, cotton, coal and metals and for a redistribution
of markets and spheres for the export of capital is inexorably
leading to another world war, the destructiveness of which will
increase in proportion to the progress achieved in the furiously
developing technic of war.

Simultaneously, the antagonisms between the imperialist home
countries and the colonial and semi-colonial countries are grow-
ing. The relative weakening of European imperialism as a result
of the war, of the development of capitalism in the colonies, of
the inﬂuence of the Soviet revolution and of the centifugal

tendencies revealed in the premier maritime and colonial empire

—Great Gritain (Canada, Australia, South Africa), has helped

 

to stimulate the movement of rebellion in the colonies and semi»

colonies. The great Chinese revolution, which roused hundreds
of millions of the Chinese people to action, caused an enormous.
breach  the imperialist system. The unceasing revolutionary
ferment among hundreds of millions of Indian workers and
peasants is threatening to break the domination of the world
citadel of -imperialism, Great Britain. The growth of tendencies
directed against the powerful imperialism of the United States
in the Latin-American countries threatens to undermine the ex-
pansion of North-American capital. Thus, the revolutionary
process in the colonies, which is drawing into the struggle against
imperialism the overwhelming majority of the world’s population
that is subjected to the rule of the ﬁnance-capital oligarchy of a
few “great powers” of imperialism, also expresses the profound
general crisis of capitalism. Even in Europe itself, where im-
perialism has put a number of small nations under its heel, the
national question is a factor that intensiﬁes the inherent contra-
dictions of capitalism.

Finally, the revolutionary crisis is inexorably maturing in the
very centres of imperialism: the capitalist offensive against the
working class, the attack upon the workers’ standard of living,
upon their organizations and their political rights, and the growth
of white terror, rouse increasing resistance on the part of the
broad masses of the proletariat and intensify the class struggle
between the working class and trustiﬁed capital. The great
battles fought between Labor and Capital, the accelerated swing
of the masses to the left, the growth in the influence and authority
of the Communist Parties; the enormous growth of’ sympathy of
the broad masses of workers for the land of the proletarian dic-
tatorship—-all this is a clear symptom of the rise of a new revo-
lutionary tide in the centres of imperialism.

Thus, the system of world imperialism, and with it the partial
stabilization of capitalism, is being corroded from various causes:

28

  

First, the antagonisms and conﬂicts between the imperialist States;
second, the rising for the struggle of vast masses in the colonial
countries; third, the action of the revolutionary proletariat in
the imperialist home countries; and lastly, the hegemony exercized

over the whole world revolutionary movement by the proletarian .

dictatorship in the U.S.S.R. The international revolution is
developing. ‘ ‘

.

Against this revolution, imperialism is gathering its forces. Ex-
peditions against the colonies, a new world war, a campaign against
the U.S.S.R. are matters which now ﬁgure prominently in the
politics of imperialism. This must lead to the release of all the

forces of international revolution and to the inevitable doom of '

capitalism.

    

    

III. The Ultimate Aim of the Communist Inter-
national—-World Communism

HE ultimate aim of the Communist International is to re-

place world capitalist economy’ by a world system of Com-
munism. Communist society, the basis for which has been pre-
pared by the whole course of historical/‘development, is manl<ind’s
only way out, for it alone can abolish the contradictions of the
capitalist system which threaten to degrade and destroy the hu-
man race.

Communist society will abolish the class division of society,
i.e., simultaneously with the abolition of anarchy of production,
it will abolish all [forces of exploitation and oppression of man
by man. Society will no longer consist of antagonistic classes in
conflict with each other, but will represent agunited commonwealth
of labor. For the first time in its history mankind will take its
fate into its own hands. Instead of destroying innumerable
human lives and incalculable wealth in struggles between classes
and nations, mankind will devote all its energy to the struggle
against the forces of nature,/to the development and strengthen-
ing of its own collective might.

After abolishing private ownership in the means of production
and converting them into social property, the world system of
Communism will replace the elemental forces of the world
market, of competition and the blind process of social produc-
tion, by consciously organized and planned production for the
purpose of satisfying rapidly growing social needs. With the
abolition of competition and anarchy in production, devastating
crises and still more devastating wars will disappear. Instead of
colossal waste of productive forces and spasmodic development
of society—there will be planned utilization of all material re-
sources and painless economic development on the basis of un-

30

restricted, smooth and rapid development of productive forces.

The abolition of private property and the disappearance of
classes will do away with the exploitation of man by man. Work
will cease to be toiling for the beneﬁt ofla class enemy: Instead
of being merely a means of livelihood it will become a necessity
of life: want and economic inequality, the misery of enslaved
classes, and a wretched standard of life generally will disappear;
the hierarchy created in the division of labor system will be
abolished together with the antagonism between mental and
manual labor; and the last vestige of the ‘social inequality of
sexes will be removed. At the same time, the organs of class
domination, and the State in the ‘first place, will disappear also.
The State, being the embodiment of class domination, will die
out insofar as classes die "out, and with it all measures of coercion
will expire.

With the disappearance of classes the monopoly of education
in every form will be abolished. Culture will become the acquire-
ment of all and the class ideologies of the past will give place to
scientific materialist philosophy. Under such circumstances, the
domination of man over man, in any form, becomes impossible,
and a great ﬁeld will be opened for the social selection and the
harmonious development of all the talents inherent in humanity.

In Communist society no social restrictions will be imposed
upon the growth of the forces of production. Private owner-
ship in the means of production, the selﬁsh lust for proﬁts, the
artiﬁcial retention of the :masses in a state of ignorance, poverty
—which retard technical progress in capitalist society—and un-
productive expenditures will have no place in a Communist so-
ciety. The most expedient utilization of the forces of nature
and of the natural conditions of production in the various parts
of the world, the removal of the antagonism between town and
country, that under capitalism results from the low technical
level of agriculture and its systematic lagging behind industry;
the closest possible cooperation between science and technics, the
utmost encouragement of research work and the practical appli-

31

 

cation of its results on the widest possible social scale, planned

~ organization of scientiﬁc work; the application of the most perfect

methods of statistical accounting and planned regulation of econ-
omy; the rapidly growing social needs, which is the most power-
ful internal driving force of the whole system—all these will
secure the maximum productivity of social labor, which in turn
will release human energy for the powerful development of
science and-art.

The development of the productive forces of world Commu-
nist society will make it possible to raise the well-being of the
whole of humanity and to reduce to a minimum the time de-
voted to material production and, consequently, will enable cul-
ture to ﬂourish as never before in history. This new culture of
a humanity that is united for the ﬁrst time in history, and has

abolished all State boundaries, will, unlike capitalist culture, be.

based upon clear and transparent human relationships. Hence,

    

\

it will bury forever all mysticism, religion, prejudice and super»

stition and will give a powerful impetus to the development of
all-conquering scientiﬁc knowledge.

The higher stage of Communism, the stage in which Commu-
nist society has already developed on its own foundation, in which

_ an enormous growth of social productive forces has accompanied

the manifold development of man, in which humanity has al-
ready inscribed on its banner: “From each according to his abili-
ties; to each accroding to his needs!”—presupposes, as a lpre1i-
minary historical condition, a lower stage of development, the stake
of Socialism. At this lower stage, Communist society only just
emerges from capitalist society and bears allithe economic, ethical
and intellectual birthmarks it has inherited from the society from

whose womb it is just emerging. The productive forces of So- ~

cialism are not yet suﬂiciently developed to assure a distribution
of the products of labor according to needs: these are distrib-
uted according to the amount of labor expended. Division of
labor, i.e., the system whereby certain groups perform certain

V labor functions, and especially the distinction between mental and

32

  

manual labor, still exists. Although classes are abolished, traces
of the old class division of society, and, consequently, remnants of
the proletarian State power, coercion, ‘laws, still exist. Con-
sequently, certain traces of inequality, which have not yet man-
aged to die '_ out altogether, still remain. The antagonism be-
tween town and country has not get been entirely removed. But

‘ none of these survivals of former society is protected or defended .

by any social force. Being the product of a deﬁnite level of
development of productive forces, they will disappear as rapidly
as mankind, freed from the fetters of the capitalist system, sub-

_ jugates the forces of nature, re-educates itself in the spirit of

Communism, and passes from Socialism to complett Communism.

 

  

IV. The Period of Transition from Capitalism to
Socialism and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

1. THE TRANSITION PERIOD AND THE CONQUEST OF POWER
BY THE PROLETARIAT

BETWEEN capitalist society and Communist society a period

of revolutionary transformation intervenes, during which the
one changes into the other. Correspondingly, there is also an
intervening period of political transition, in which the essential
State form is the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.
The transition from the world dictatorship of imperialism to the
world dictatorship of the proletariat extends over a long period of
proletarian_ struggles with defeats as well as victories; a period
of continuous general crisis in capitalist relationships and growth
of social revolutions, i.e., of proletarian civil wars against the
bourgeoisie; a period of national wars and colonial rebellions
which, although not in themselves revolutionary proletarian So-
cialist movements, are nevertheless, objectively, insofar as they
undermine the domination of imperialism, constituent parts of
the world proletarian revolution; a period in which capitalist and
Socialist economic and social systems exist side by side in “peace-
ful” relationships as well as in armed conﬂict; a period of forma-
tion of a_Union of Soviet Republics; a period of wars of impe-

prialist States against Soviet States; a period in which the ties -

between the Soviet States and colonial peoples become more and
more closely established, etc. I

Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law
of capitalism. This unevenness is still more pronounced and
acute in the epoch of imperialism. Hence, it follows that the
international proletarian revolution cannot be conceived as a single
event occurring simultaneously all over the world; at first So-
cialism maybe victorious in a few, or even in one single capitalist

34

 

  

country. Every such proletarian victory, however, broadens the
basis of the world revolution and consequently, still further in-
tensiﬁes the general crisis of capitalism. Thus, the capitalist
system as a whole reaches the point of its ﬁnal collapse; the
dictatorship of ﬁnance capital perishes and gives place to the
dictatorship of the proletariat.

Bourgeois revolutions _brought about the- political liberation
of a system of productive relationships that had already estab-

-lished itself and become‘ economically dominant, and trans-

ferred political power from the hands of one class of exploiters
to the hands of another. Proletarian revolution, however, signi-
ﬁes the forcible invasion of the proletariat into the domain of
property relationships of bourgeois society, the expropriation of
the expropriatingiclasses, and the transference of power to a class
that aimsat the radical reconstruction of the economic foundations
of society and the abolition of all exploitation of man by man.
The political domination of the feudal barons all over the world
was broken in a series of separate bourgeois revolutions that ex-
tended over a period of centuries. The international proletarian
revolution, however, although it will not be a single simultaneous
act, but _one extending over a whole epoch, nevertheless—thanl<s
to the closer ties that now exist between the countries of the
world, will accomplish its mission in a much shorter period of
time. Only after the proletariat has achieved victory and con-
solidated its power all over the world will a prolonged period of
intensive construction of world Socialist economy set in.

The conquest of power by the proletariat is a necessary con-
dition precedent to the growth of Socialist forms of economy and
to the cultural growth of the proletariat, which changes its own
nature, perfects itself for the leadership of society in all spheres
of life, draws into this process of transformation all other classes
and’ thus prepares the ground for the abolition of classes alto-
gether.

In the struggle for the dictatorship ‘of the proletariat, and
35

 

 
 

later for the transformation of the social system, as against the
alliance of capitalists and landlords an alliance of workers and
peasants is formed, under the intellectual and political hegemony
of the former, an alliance which serves as the basis for the dic-
tatorship of the proletariat.

The characteristic feature of the transition period as a whole,
is the ruthless suppression of the resistance of the exploite-'.'s.
the organization of Socialist construction, the mass training of
men and women in the spirit of Socialism and the gradual disap-
pearance of classes. Only to the extent that these great historical
tasks are fulﬁlled will society of the transition period become
transformed into Communist society.

Thus, the dictatorship of the world proletariat is an essential
and vital condition precedent to the transition of world capi-
talist economy to Socialist economy. This world dictatorship can
be established only when the victory of Socialism has been
achieved in certain countries or groups of countries, when the

 

newly established proletarian republics enter into a federal union '

with the already existing proletarian republics, when the number
of such ‘federations has grown and extended also to the colonies
which have emancipated themselves from the yoke of imperialism;
when these federations of republics have finally grown into a

World Union of Soviet Socialist Republics uniting the whole '

of mankind under the hegemony of the international proletariat
organized as a State.

The conquest of power by the proletariat does not mean
peacefully “capturing” the ready-made bourgeois State machinery

by means of a parliamentary majority. The bourgeoisie resorts"

to every means of violence and terror to safeguard and strengthen
its predatory property and its political domination. Like the
feudal nobility of the past, the bourgeoisie cannot abandon its
historical position to the new class without a. desperate and
frantic struggle. Hence, the violence of the bourgeoisie can be
suppressed only by the -stern violence of the proletariat- The

36'

  

conquest of power by the proletariat is the violent overthrow of
bourgeois power, the destruction of the capitalist State apparatus
(bourgeois armies, police, bureaucratic hierarchy, the judiciary,
parliaments, etc.), and substituting in its place new organs of
proletarian power, to serve primarily as instruments for the sup-
pression of the exploiters. .

2. THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT AND ITS SOVIET
FORM

As has been shown by the experience of the October revolu-
tion of 1917 and by the Hungarian revolution, which irnmeasur-
ably enlarged the experience of the Paris Commune of 1871,
the most suitable form of proletarian State, is the Soviet State——
a new type of State, which differs in principle from the bourgeois
State, not only in its class content, but also in its internal struc-
ture. This is precisely the type of State which, emerging as it
does directly out of the broadest possible mass movement of the
toilets, secures the maximum of mass activity and is, consequently,
the surest guarantee of final victory.

The Soviet form of State, being the highest form of democ-
racy, namely, proletarian democracy, is the very opposite of bour-
geois democracy, which is bourgeois dictatorship in a masked
form. The Soviet State is the dictatorship of the proletariat,
the rule of a_.single class — the proletariat. Unlike bourgeois
democracy, proletarian democracy openly admits its class char-
acter and aims avowedly at the suppression of the exploiters in
the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.
It deprives its class enemies of political rights and, under special
historical conditions, may grant the proletariat a number‘ of tem-
porary advantages over the diffused petty bourgeois peasantry
in order to strengthen its role of leader. While disarming and
suppressing its class enemies, the proletarian State at the same
time regards this deprivation of political rights and partial re-
striction of liberty as temporary measures in the struggle against
the attempts on the part of the exploiters to defend or restore

their privileges. It inscribes on its banner the motto: the pro-
letariat holds power not for the purpose of perpetuating it, not
for the purpose of protecting narrow craft and professional in-
ter-sts, but for the purpose of uniting the backward and scat-
tered rural proletariat, the serni-proletariat and the toiling peas-
ants still more closely with the more progressive strata of the
workers, for the purpose of gradually and systematically over-
coming class divisions altogether. Being an all-embracing form
of the unity and organization of the masses under the leader-
ship of the proletariat, the Soviets, in actual fact, draw the broad
masses of the proletariat, the peasants and all toilers into the
struggle for Socialism, into the work of building up Socialism, and
into the practical administration of the State; in the whole of
their work they rely upon the working-class organizations and
practice the principles of broad democracy among the toilets to
a far greater extent and immeasurably closer to the masses than
any other form of government. The right of electing and recall-
ing delegates, the combination of the executive with the legis-
lative power, the electoral system based on a production and not
on a residential qualiﬁcation (election by workshops, factories,
etc.)——all this secures for the. working class and for the broad
masses of the toilets who march under its hegemony systematic,
continuous and active participation in all public alfairs—economic_.
social, political, military and cultural—-—and marks the sharp
difference that exists between the bourgeois-parliamentary repub-
lic and the Soviet dictatorship of the proletariat.

Bourgeois democracy, with its formal equality of all citizens
before the law, is in reality based on a glaring material and eco-
nomic inequality of classes. By leaving inviolable, defending and
strengthening the monopoly of the capitalist landlord classes
in the vital means of production, bourgeois democracy, as far as
the exploited classes and especially the proletariat is concerned,
converts this formal equality before the law and these democratic
rights and liberties-—which in practice are systematically cur-
tailed, into a juridical fiction and, consequently, into a means for

38

 

deceiving and enslaving the masses. Being the expression of the
political domination of the bourgeoisie, so-called democracy is
therefore capitalist democracy. By depriving the exploiting
classes of the means of production, by placing the monopoly of
these means of production in the hands of the proletariat as the
dominant class in society, the Soviet State, first and foremost
guarantees to the working class and to the toilets generally the
material conditions for the exercise of their rights by providing
them with premises, public buildings, printing plants, travelling
facilities, etc. ' --

In the domain of general political rights the Soviet State,
while depriving the exploiters and the enemies of the people of
political rights, completely abolishes for the first time all inequal-
ity of citizenship, which under systems of exploitation is based
on distinctions of sex, religion and nationality; in this sphere it
establishes an equality that is not to be found in any bourgeois
country. In this respect, also, the dictatorship of the proletariat
steadily lays down the material basis upon which this equality
may be truly exercised by introducing measures for the eman-
cipation of women, the industrialization of former colonies, etc.

Soviet democracy, therefore, is proletarian democracy, de-
mocracy of the toiling masses, democracy directed against the
exploiters.

The Soviet State completely disarms the bourgeoisie and con-»
centrates all arms in the hands of the proletariat; it is the
armed proletarian State. The armed forces under the Soviet
State are organized on a class basis, which corresponds to the
general structure of the proletarian dictatorship, and guarantees
the role of leadership to the industrial proletariat. This organ-
ization, while maintaining revolutionary discipline, ensures to
the warriors of the Red Army and Navy close and constant
contacts with the masses of the toilets, participation in the ad-
ministration of the country and in the work of building up
Socialism.

3. THE DIC'l'A'l‘0RSI-IIP OF THE PROLETARIAT AND THE
EXPROPRIATION OF THE EXPROPRIATORS

The victorious proletariat utilizes the conquest of power as
a lever of economic revolution, i. e., the revolutionary transfor-
mation of the property relations of capitalism into relationships
of the Socialist mode of production. The starting point of this
great economic revolution is the expropriation of the landlords
and capitalists, i. e., the conversion of the monopolistic property
of the bourgeoisie into the property of the proletarian State.

In this sphere the Communist International advances the fol-
lowing fundamental tasks of the proletarian dictatorship:

A. Industry, Transport and Communication Services
a) The conﬁscation and proletarian nationalization of all
large private capitalist undertakings (factories, plants, mines and
electric power stations) and the transference of all State and
municipal enterprises to the Soviets.

b) The confiscation and proletarian nationalization of pri-
vate capitalist railway, waterway, automobile and air transport
services (commercial and passenger air ﬂeet) and the trans-
ference of all State and municipal transport services to the
Soviets.

c) The conﬁscation and proletarian nationalization of pri-
vate capitalist communication services (telegraphs, telephones and
wireless) "and the transference of State and municipal communi-
cation services to the Soviets. '

cl) The organization of workers’ management of industry.
The establishment of State organs for the management of in-
dustry with provision for the close participation of the trade
unions in this work of management. Appropriate functions to
be guaranteed for the factory and plant committees.

e) Industrial activity to be directed towards the satisfaction
of the needs of the broad masses ‘of the toilets. The reorganiza-
tion of the branches of industry that formerly served the needs

.40

 

44

of the ruling class (luxury, trades, etc.). The strengthening of
the branches of industry that will facilitate the development of
agriculture, with the object of strengthening the ties between
industry and peasant economy, of facilitating the development of
State farms, and of accelerating the rate of development of
national economy as a whole.

B. Agriculture

a) The conﬁscation and proletarian nationalization 'of all
large landed estates_in town and country (private, church, monas-
tery and other lands) and the transference of State and munici-
pal landed property including forests, minerals, lakes, rivers, etc.,
to the Soviets with subsequent nationalization of the whole of the

land.

b) The conﬁscation of all property utilized in production
belonging to large landed estates, such as: buildings, machinery
and other inventory, cattle, enterprises for the manufacture of
agricultural products (large ﬂour mills, cheese plants, dairy
farms, fruit and vegetable drying.plants, etc.).

c) The transfer of large estates, particularly model estates

and those of considerable economic importance, to the manage-
ment of the organs of the proletarian dictatorship and of the
Soviet farm organizations.

d) Part of the land conﬁscated from the landlords and others,
particularly where the land was cultivated by the peasants on.
a tenant basis and served as a means of holding the peasantry
in economic bondage,-—-to be transferred to the use of the peas-
antry (to the poor and partly also to the middle strata of the
peasantry). The amount of land to be so transferred to be
determined -by economic expediency as well as‘ by the degree of
necessity to neutralize the peasantry and to win them over to
the side of the proletariat; this amount must necessarily vary
according to the different circumstances.

e) Prohibition of buying and selling of land, as a means
41

 

  

of preserving the land for the peasantry and preventing its
passing into the hands of capitalists, land speculators, etc. Of-
fenders against this law to be severely prosecuted.

f) To combat usury. All transactions entailing terms of
bondage to be annulled. All debts of the exploited strata of the
peasantry to be annulled. The poorest stratum of the peasantry
to be-relieved from taxation, etc.

g) Comprehensive State measures for developing the pro-
ductive forces of agriculture; the development of rural electri-
ﬁcation; the manufacture of tractors, the production of artiﬁcia.l
‘fertilizers; the production of pure quality seeds and raising
thoroughbred stock on Soviet farms; the extensive organization
of agricultural credits for land reclamation, etc.

h) Financial and other support for agricultural co-operation
and for all forms.of collective production in the rural districts
(co-operative societies, communes, etc.). Systematic propaganda
in favor of peasant co-operation (selling, credit and supply co-
operative societies) to be based on the mass activity of the
peasants themselves"; propaganda in favor of the transition to
large-scale agricultural production which——owing to the un~
doubted technical and economic advantages of large-scale pro-
duction,—provide the greatest immediate economic gain and also
a method of transition to Socialism most accessible to the broad
masses of the toiling peasants.

C. Trade and Credit

a) The proletarian nationalization of private banks (the en-
tire gold reserve, all securities, deposits, etc., to be transferrtd
to the proletarian State); the proletarian State to take over
State, municipal, etc., banks.

b) The centralization of banking; all nationalized big banks
to be subordinated to the central State bank.

c) The nationalization of wholesale trade and large retail
trading enterprizes (warehouses, elevators, stores, stocks of

42

 

  

goods, etc.), and their transfer to the organs of the Soviet State.

d)‘ Every encouragement to be given to consumers’ co-opera-
tives as representing an integral part of the distributing appa-
ratus, while maintaining uniformity in their system of work and
securing the active participation of the masses themselves in
their work;

e) The monopoly of foreign trade.

f) The repudiation of «State debts to foreign and home
capitalists. ~

D. Conditions of Life, llabor, Etc.

a) Reduction of the working day to seven hours, and to
six hours in industries particularly harmful to the health of the
workers. Further reduction of the working day and transition
to a five-day week in countries with developed productive forces.
Theregulation of the working day to correspond to the increase
of the productivity of labor. ’

b) Prohibition, as a rule, of night work and employment in
harmful trades for all females. Prohibition of child labor. Pro-
hibition of overtime. —

c) Special reduction of the work-day for the youth (a maxi-
mum six-hour day for young persons up to 18 years of age).
Socialistic reorganization of the labor of young persons so as
to combine employment in industry with general and political
education. '

d) Social insurance in all forms (sickness, old age, accident,
unemployment, etc.) at State expense (and at the expense of the
owners of private enterprises where they still exist), insurance
affairs to be managed by the insured themselves.

e) Comprehensive measures of hygiene; the organization of
free medical service. To combat social diseases (alcoholism,
venereal diseases, tuberculosis, etc.) .

f) Complete equality. between men and women before the

43

 

laws; recognition of maternity as a social function; protection of
mothers and infants. Initiation of social care and upbringing of
infants and children (creches, kindergartens, children’s homes,
etc.) . -

The establishment of institutions that will gradually relieve
the burden of house drudgery (public kitchens and laundries);
and systematic cultural struggle against the ideology and tradi-
tions of female bondage. '

E. Housing _
a) The conﬁscation of big house property.

b) The transfer of conﬁscated houses to the administration
of the local Soviets. ~

c) Workers to be removed to bourgeois residential districts.

d) Palaces and large private and public buildings to be placed
at the disposal of labor organizations. " ‘

e) The carrying out of an extensive program of house con-
struction.

F. National and Colonial Questions

a) The recognition of the right of all nations, irrespective
of race, to complete self-determination, that is, self-determination.
inclusive of the right to State separation.

b) The voluntary uniﬁcation and centralization of the military
and economic forces of all nations, liberated from capitalism for
the purpose of ﬁghting against imperialism and for building up
Socialist economy. ‘

c) Wide and determined struggle against the‘ imposition of
any kind of limitation and restriction upon any nationality, nation
or race. Complete equality for all nations and races. '

d) The Soviet State_ to guarantee and support with all the
resources at its command the national cultures of nations lib-

erated from capitalism, at the same time to carry out a consistent
proletarian policy directed towardsithe development of the con-
tent of such cultures.

e) Every assistance to be rendered to the economic, political
and cultural growth of the formerly oppressed “territories,” “do-
minions” and “colonies,” with the object oftransferring them to
Socialist lines, so that a durable basis may be laid for complete
national equality. » 4

f) To combat all remnants of chauvinism, national hatred,
race prejudices and other ideological products of feudaland cap-
italist barbarism.

G. Mean: of Ideological Influence
a) The nationalization of printing plants.
b) The monopoly of newspaper and book-publishing-

c) The nationalization of big cinema enterprises, theatres, etc.

d) The utilization of the nationalized means of “intellectual
production” for the most extensive political and general educa-
tion of the toilets and for the building up of a new Socialist cul-
ture on a proletarian class basis. - 

1-. THE BASIS FOR THE ECONOMIC POLICY OF THE PROLETARIAN
DICTATORSHIP

In carrying out all these tasks of the dictatorship of the pro-
letariat, the following _postulates must be borne in mind:

1. The complete abolition of private property in land, and
the nationalization of the land, cannot be brought about imme-
diately in the more developed capitalist countries, where the prin-
ciple of private property is deep-rooted among broad strata of the
peasantry. In such countries, the nationalization of all the land
can only be brought about gradually, by means of a series of
transitional measures. '

2. Nationalization of production should not, as a rule, be
i 45

 

  

applied to small and middle-sized enterprises (peasants, small
artisans, handicraft, small and medium shops, small manufac-
turers, etc.). Firstly, because the proletariat must draw a strict
distinction between the propertyiof the small commodity producer
working for himself, who can and must be gradually brought into
the groove of Socialist construction, and the property of the
capitalist exploiter, the liquidation of which is an indispensible
prerequisite for Socialist construction.

Secondly, because the proletariat, after seizing power, may
not have suﬂicient organizing forces at its disposal, particularly
in the first phases of the dictatorship, for the purpose of de-
stroying capitalism and at the ‘same time to establish contacts
with the smaller and medium individual units of production on a
Socialist basis. These small individual enterprises (primarily
peasant enterprises) will be drawn into the general Socialist or-
ganization of production and distribution only gradually, with
the powerful and systematic aid the proletarian State will render
to organize them in all the various forms of collective enterprises.
Any attempt to break up their economic system violently and to
compel them to adopt collective methods by force will only lead
to harmful results.

3. Owing to the prevalence of a large number of small units
of production (primarily peasant farms, farmers’ enterprises,
small artisans, small shopkeepers, etc.) in colonies, semi-colonies
and economically backward countries, where the petty-bourgeois
masses represent the overwhelming majority of the population,
and even in centers of capitalist world industry (the United
States of America, Germany, and to some degree also England),
it is necessary, in the first stage of development to preserve to
some extent, market forms of economic contacts, the money sys-
tem, etc. The variety of prevailing economic forms (ranging from
Socialist large scale industry to small peasant and artisan enter-
prises), which unavoidably come into conflict with each other; the
variety of classes and class groups corresponding to this variety
of economic forms, each having diﬂerent stimuli for economic ac-

46

 

  

tivity and conflicting class interests, and ﬁnally, the prevalence in
all spheres of economic life, of habits and traditions inherited
from bourgeois activity, which cannot be removed all at once,--
all this demands that the proletariat, in exercising its economic
leadership, shall properly combine, on the basis of market rela-
tionship, large-scale Socialist industry with the small enterprises
of the simple commodity producers, i. e., it must combine them
in such a way as to guarantee the leading role to Socialist indus-
try and at the same time bring about the greatest possible devel-
opment of the mass of peasant enterprises. Hence, the greater
the weight of importance of scattered, small peasant labor in the
general economy of the country, the greater will be the extent o.‘
market relations, the smaller will be the signiﬁcance of directly
planned management, and the greater will be the degree to which
the general economic plan will depend upon forecasts of uncon-
trollable economic relations. On the other hand, the smaller the
weight of importance of small production, the greater will be the
proportion of socialized labor, the more powerful will be the
concentrated and socialized means of production, the smaller will
be the extent of market relations, the greater will be the impor-
tance of planned management as compared with uncoordinated
management and the more considerable and universal will be the
application of planned management in the sphere of production
and distribution.

Provided the proletarian dictatorship carries out a correct
class policy,—i. e. provided proper account is taken of class-
relationships,——the technical and economic superiority of large-
scale socialized production, the centralization of all the most
important‘ economic key positions (industry, transport, large-
scale agricultural enterprises, banks, etc.) in the hands of the
proletarian State, planned management of industry, and the
power wielded by the State apparatus as a whole (the budget,
taxes, administrative legislation and legislation generally), ren-
der it possible continuously and systematically to dislodge pri-
vate capital and the new outcrops of capitalism which, in the

period of more or less free commercial and market relations
emerge in town and country with the development of simple

- commodity production (big farmers, kulaks). At the same time,

 

by organizing peasant farming on co-operative lines, and as a
result of the growth of collective forms of economy, the great
bulk of the peasant enterprises will be systematically drawn into
the main channel of developing Socialism. The outwardly capi-
talist forms and methods of economic activity that are bound
up with market relations (money form of accounting, payment
for labor in money, buying andselling, credit and banks, etc.),
serve as levers for the Socialist transformation, insofar as they
to an increasing degree serve the consistently Socialist type of
enterprises, i. e., the Socialist section of economy.

Thus provided the State carries out a correct policy, market
relations under the proletarian dictatorship destroy themselves
in the process of their own developm;nt: by helping to dislodge
private capital, by changing the character of peasant economy,
by further centralization and concentration of the means of pro-
duction in the hands of the proletarian State—-by these means
they help to destroy market reliztionst altogether.

In the event of probable capitalist military intervention, and
of prolonged counter-revolutionary wars against the dictatorship
of the proletariat, the necessity may arise for a war-Communist
economic policy (“War Communism”), which is nothing more
nor less than the organization of rational consumption for the
purpose of military defense, accompanied by a system of inten-
siﬁed pressure upon the capitalist groups (conﬁscation, requisi-
tions, etc.) _, with the more or less complete liquidation of free-
dom of trade and market relations and a sharp disturbance of
the individualistic, economic stimuli of the small producers,
which results in a diminution of the productive forces of the

 

country. This policy of “War Communism,” while it under- ‘
mines the material basis of the strata of the population in the .

country that are hostile to the working class, secures a rational
distribution of the available supplies and facilitates the military

48

  

struggle of the proletarian dictatorship,—which is the historical
justiﬁcation of this policy—nevertheless, carmot be regarded as
the “normal” economic policy of theiproletarian dictatorship.

5. DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROI-.ETARIAT AND THE CLASSES

The dictatorship of the proletariat is a continuation of. the
class struggle under new conditions. The dictatorship of the
proletariat is a stubborn ﬁght—bloody and bloodless, violent and
peaceful, military and economic, pedagogical and administrative,
against the forces and traditions of the old society, against
external capitalist enemies, against the remnants of the exploit-
ing classes within the country, against the upshoots of the new
bourgeoisie that spring up on the basis ‘of still prevailing com-
modity production. ‘

After the civil war has been brought to an end the stub-s

born class struggle continues in new forms, primarily, in the
form of a struggle between the survivals of previous economic
systems and fresh upshoots of them on the one hand, and So-
cialist forms of economy on the other. The forms of the struggle
undergo a change at various stages of Socialist development’,
and in the first stages, the struggle, under certain conditions,
may be extremely severe.

In the initial stageiof the proletarian dictatorship, the policy
of the proletariat towards other classes and social groups within
the country is determined by the following postulates:

1. The big bourgeoisie and the landowners, a section of the
oﬂicer corps, the higher command of the forces, and the higher
bureaucracy-—who remain loyal to the bourgeoisie and the land-
lords—are consistent enemies of the working class against whom
ruthless war must be waged. The organizing skill of a certain
section of these strata may be utilized, but as a rule, only after
the dictatorship has been consolidated and all conspiracies and
rebellions of exploiters have been decisively crushed.

2. In regard to the technical intelligentsia, which was
49

 
 

brought up in the spirit of bourgeois traditions and the higher
ranks of which were closely linked up with the commanding
apparatus of capital, the proletariat, while ruthlessly suppressing
every counter-revolutionary action on the part of hostile sections
of the intelligentsia, must at the same time give consideration to
the necessity of utilizing this skilled social force for the work of
Socialist construction; it must give every encouragement to the
groups that are neutral, and especially to those that are friendly,
towards the proletarian- revolution. In widening the economic,
technical and cultural perspective of Socialist construction to its
utmost social limits, the proletariat must. systematically win over

the technical intelligentsia to its side, subject to its ideological

    

inﬂuence and secure its close co-operation in the work of social
reconstruction. ‘

3. In regard to the peasantry, the task of the Communist
Parties, is, while placing its reliance in the agricultural prole-
tariat, to win over all the exploited and toiling strata of the
countryside. ' The victorious proletariat must draw strict distinc-
tions between the various groups among the peasantry, weigh
their relative importance, and render every support to the prop-
ertyless and semi-proletarian sections of the peasantry by trans-
ferring to them a part of the land taken from the big land-
owners by helping them in their struggle against usurer’s capi-
tal, etc. Moreover, the proletariat must neutralize the middle
strata of thepeasantry and mercilessly suppress the slightest
opposition on the part of the village bourgeoisie who ally them-
selves with the landowners. As its dictatorship becomes con-
solidated and Socialist construction develops, the proletariat must
proceed from the policy of neutralization to a policy of durable
alliance with the masses of middle peasantry, but must not adopt
the viewpoint of sharing power in any form. The dictatorship
of the proletariat implies that the industrial workers alone are
capable of leading the entire mass of the toilers. On the other
hand, while representing the rule of a single class, the dictator-
ship of the proletariat at the same time represents a special

50

 

form of class alliance between the proletariat, as the vanguard
of the toilers, and the numerous non-proletarian sections of the
toiling masses, or the majority of them. It represents an alliance
for the complete overthrow of capital, for the complete suppres-
sion of the opposition of the bourgeoisie and its attempts at
restoration, an alliance aiming at the complete building up and
consolidation of Socialism. '

4. The petty urban bourgeoisie, which continuously wavers
between extreme reaction and sympathy for the proletariat, must
likewise be neutralized and, as far as possible, won over to
the side of the proletariat. This can be achieved by leaving. to

_them their small property and permitting a certain measure of

free trade, by releasing them from the bondage of usurious credit
and by the prole-tariat’s helping them in all sorts of ways in
the struggle against all and every form of capitalist oppression.

6. MASS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE SYSTEM OF PROLETARIAN
DICTATORSHIP

In the process of fulﬁlling ‘these tasks of the proletarian
dictatorship, a radical change takes place in the tasks and func-
tions of the mass organizations, particularly of the labor organ-
izations. Under capitalism, the ma_ss labor organizations, in
which the broad masses of the proletariat were originally organ-
ized and trained, i. e., the trade (industrial) unions, serve as the
principal weapons in the struggle against trustiﬁed capital and its
State. Under the proletarian dictatorship, they become trans-.
formed into the principal lever of the State; they become trans-
formed into‘ a school of Communism, byrmeans of which vast
masses of the proletariat are drawn into the work of Socialist
management of production; they are transformed into organiza-
tions directly connected with all parts of the State apparatus,
inﬂuencing all branches of its work, safeguarding the permanent
and day to day interests of the worlciug class and fighting against
bureaucracy in the departments of the State. Thus, in so far

as they promote from their ranks leaders in the work of con-

51

 
 

struction, draw into this work of construction broad sections of
the proletariat and aim at combating bureaucracy, which inevit-
ably arises as a result of the operation of class inﬂuences alien
to the proletariat and of‘ the inadequate cultural development of
the masses, the trade unions become the backbone of the prole-
tarian economic and State organization as a whole.

Notwithstanding reformist utopias,_ working class co-opera-
tive organizations under capita.lism are doomed to play a very
minor role and in the general environment of the capitalist
system_ not infrequently degenerate into mere appendages of
capitalism. Under the. dictatorship of the proletariat, however,
these organizations can and must become the most important
.units of the distributing apparatus.

Lastly, peasant agricultural co-operative organizations (sell-
-ing, purchasing, credit and producing), under proper manage-
«ment and provided a systematic struggle is carried on against

the capitalist elements, and that really broad masses of the

    

toilers who follow the lead of the proletariat take a really active
-part in their work, can and must become one of the principal
organizational means for linking up town and country. To the
extent that they were able to maintain their existence at all under
capitalism,’ co-operative peasant enterprises inevitably became
transformed into capitalist enterprises, for they were dependent
upon capitalist industry, capitalist banks and upon capitalist eco-
nomic environment. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat,
‘however, such enterprises develop amidst a different system of
relationships, depend upon proletarian industry, proletarian
"banks, etc. Thus, provided the proletariat carries out a proper
épolicy, provided the class struggle is systematically conducted
against the capitalist elements outside as well as inside the co-
-operative organizations, and provided Socialist industry exercises
'-its guidance over it, agricultural co-operation will "become one
of the principal levers for the Socialist transformation and collec-
tivization of the countryside. All this, however, does not exclude
the possibility that in certain countries the consumers’ societies,

52.

 

x
and particularly the agricultural co-operative societies led by the
bourgeoisie and their social-democratic agents, will at ﬁrst be
hotbeds of counter-revolutionary activity and sabotage against
the work of economic construction of the workers’ revolution.

In the course of this militant and constructive work, car-
ried on through the medium of these multifarious proletarian
organizations—which should serve as effective levers of the Soviet
State and the link between it and the masses of all strata
of the working class—the proletariat secures unity of will and
action and exercises this unity through the medium of the Com-
munist Party, which play: the leading role in the system of the
proletarian dictatorship.

The Party of the proletariat relies directly on the trade
unions and other organizations that embrace the masses of the
workers, and through these, relies on the peasantry (Soviets,
co-operative societies, Young (Communist League, etc.) ; by
means of "these levers it guides the whole Soviet system. The
proletariat can fulﬁll its role as organizer of the new society only
if the Soviet government is loyally supported by all the mass
organizations, only if classunity is maintained, and only under
the guidance of the Party.

7. THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE EROLETARIAT AND THE CULTURAL
REVOLUTION

The role of organizer of the new human society presupposes
that the proletariat itself will become culturally mature, that it
will transform its own nature, that it will continually promote
from its ranks increasing numbers of men and women capable
of mastering science, technics and administration in order to build
up Socialism and a new Socialist culture.

Bourgeois revolution against feudalism presupposes that a new
class has arisen in the midst of feudal society that is culturally
more advanced than the ruling class and is already the domi-
nant factor in economic life. The proletarian revolution, how-
ever, develops under other conditions. Being economically ex-

53

    

 
 

ploited, politically oppressed and culturally downtrodden under
capitalism, the working class transforms its own nature only
in the course of the transition period, only after it has conquered
State power, only by destroying the bourgeois monopoly of
education and mastering all the sciences, and only after it has
gained experience in great works of construction. The mass
awakening of Communist consciousness, the cause of Socialism
itself, calls for a mass change of human nature, which can be
achieved only in the course of the practical movement, in revo-
lution. Hence, revolution is not only necessary because there is
no other way of overthrowing the ruling class, but also because,
only in the process of revolution is the overthrowing class able
to purge itself of the dross of the old society and become
capable of creating a new society.

In destroying the capitalist monopoly of the means of pro-
duction, the working class must also destroy the capitalist mo-
nopoly of education, that is, it must take possession of all the
schools, from the elementary schools to the universities. It is
particularly important for the proletariat to train members°of
the working class as experts in the sphere of production (en-
gineers, technicians, organizers, etc.), as well as in the sphere
of military affairs, science, art, etc. Parallel with this work
stands the task of raising the general cultural level of ‘the pro-
letarian masses, of improving their political education, of raising
their general standard of knowledge and technical skill, of train-
ing them in the methods of public work and administration, and
of combating the survivals of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois
prejudices, etc.

Only to the extent that the proletariat promotes from its
own ranks a body of men and women capable of occupying the
“key positions” of Socialist construction, only to the extent that
this body grows, and draws increasing numbers of the working
class into‘ the process of‘ revolutionary-cultural transformation
and gradually obliterates the line that divides the proletariat into
an “advanced” and a “backward” section will the guarantees be

54 .

 

created for successful Socialist construction and against bureau-
cratic decay and class degeneracy.

However, in the process of revolution the proletariat not
only changes its own nature, but also the nature of other classes,
primarily the numerous petty-bourgeois strata in town and coun-
try and especially the toiling sections of the peasantry. By
drawing the wide masses into the process of cultural revolution
and Socialist construction, by uniting and Communistically edu-
cating them with all the means at its "disposal, by strongly com-
bating all anti-proletarian and narrow craft ideologies, and by
persistently and systematically overcoming the general and cul-
tural backwardness of the rural districts, the working class, on
the basis of the developing collective forms of economy, prepares
the way for the complete removal of class divisions in society.

One of the most important tasks of the cultural revolution

affecting the wide masses, is the task of systematically and un-
swervingly combating relz'gion—the opium of the people. The
proletarian government must withdraw all State support from
the Church, which is the agency of the former ruling class; it
must prevent all church interference in State-organized educa-
tional affairs, and ruthlessly suppress the counter-revolutionary
activity of the ecclesiastical organizations. At the same time,
the proletarian State, while granting liberty of worship and
abolishing the privileged position of the formerly dominant re-
ligion, carries on anti-religious propaganda with all the means
at its command and reconstructs the whole of its educational
work on the basis of scientific materialism.

8. THE STRUGGLE FOR THE WORLD DICTATORS}-HP OF THE
PROLETARIAT AND THE PRlNCIPAL TYPES OF REVOLUTIONS

The international proletarian revolution represents a com-
bination of processes which vary in time and character; purely
proletarian revolutions; revolutions of a bourgeois-democratic
type which grow into proletarian revolutions; wars for national
liberation; colonial revolutions. The World Dictators/rip of the

55

 
  

Proletariat comes only as the ﬁnal result of the revolutionary
process.

The uneven development of capitalism, which became more
accentuated in the period of , imperialism, has given" rise to a
variety of types of capitalism, to different stages of ripeness of
capitalism in different countries, and to a variety of speciﬁc
conditions of the revolutionary process. These circumstances
make it historically inevitable that the proletariat will come to
power by a variety of ways and degrees of rapidity; that a
number of countries must pass through certain transition stages
leading to the dictatorship of the proletariat and must adopt
varied forms of Socialist construction.

’The variety of conditions and ways by which the proletariat
will achieve its dictatorship in the various countries may be
divided schematically into three main types.

Countries of highly developed capitalism (United States of
America, Germany, Great Britain, etc.), having powerful pro-
ductive forces, highly centralized production, with small-scale
production reduced to relative insigniﬁcance, and a long estab-
lished bourgeois-democratic political system. In such countries
the fundamental political demand of the program is direct tran-
sition to the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the economic
sphere, the most characteristic demands are: expropriation of
the whole of large-scale industry; organization of a -large num-
ber of State Soviet farms and, in contrast to this, a relatively
small portion of the land to be transferred to the peasantry; un-
regulated market relations to be given comparatively small scope;
rapid rate of Socialist development generally, and of collectiviza-
tion of peasant farming in particular.

Countries with a medium development of capitalism (Spain,
Portugal, -Poland, Hungary, the Balkan countries, etc.), having
numerous survivals of semi-feudal relationships in agriculture,
possessing, to a certain extent, the material prerequisites for
Socialist construction, and in’ which the bourgeois-democratic

56

   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    

reforms have not yet been completed. In some of these coun-
tries a process of more or less rapid development from bour-
geois-democratic revolution to Socialist revolution is possible.
In others, there may be types of proletarian revolutions which
will have a large number of bourgeois-democratic tasks to ful-
ﬁll. Hence, in these countries, the dictatorship of the proletariat
may not come about at once, but in the process of transition
from the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peas-
antry to the Socialist dictatorship of the proletariat; where the
revolution develops directly as a proletarian revolution it is
presumed that the proletariat exercises leadership over a broad
agrarian peasant movement. In general, the agrarian revolution
plays a most important part in these countries, and in some cases
a decisive role; in the process of expropriating large landed prop-
erty a considerable portion of the conﬁscated -land is placed
at the disposal of the peasantry; the volume of market relations
prevailing after the victory of the proletariat is considerable; the
task of organizing the peasantry along co~operative lines and
later, of combining them in production, occupies an important
place among the tasks of Socialist construction. The rate of this
construction is relatively slow.

‘Colonial and semi-colonial countries (China, ‘India, etc.) and
dependent countries (Argentina, Brazil, etc.), having the rudi-
ments of and in some cases considerably developed industry,
but in the majority of cases inadequate for independent Socialist
construction; with feudal medieval relationships, or “Asiatic
mode of production” relationships prevailing in their economics
industrial, commercial and banking. enterprises, the principal
means of transport, the large landed estates (latifundia), planta-
tions, etc., are concentrated in the hands of foreign imperialist
groups. The principal tasks in such countries are, on the one
hand, to ﬁght against fuedalism and the pre-capitalist forms of
exploitation and to develop systematically the peasant agrarian
revolution; on the other hand, to ﬁght against foreign imperial-
ism and for national independence. As a rule, transition to the

dictatorship of the proletariattin these countries will be possible
only through a series of preparatory stages, as the outcome of
a whole period of transformation of bourgeois-democratic revolu-
tion into Socialist revolution, while in the majority of cases,
successful Socialist construction will be possible only if direct
support is obtained ‘from the countries in which the proletarian
dictatorship is established.

In still more backward countries (as in some parts of Africa)
where there are no wage workers or very few, where the ma-
jority of the population still live in tribal conditions, where
survivals of primitive tribal forms still exist, where the na-
tional bourgeoisie is almost non-existent, where the primary role
of foreign imperialism is that of military occupation and usur-
pation of land, the central task is to ﬁght for national. inde-
pendence. Victorious national uprisings in these countries may
open the way for their direct development towards Socialism
and their avoiding the stage of capitalism, provided real, power-
ful assistance is rendered to them by the countries in which
the proletarian dictatorship is established.

Thus, in the epoch in which the proletariat in the most de-
veloped capitalist countries is confronted with the immediate
task of capturing power, in which the dictatorship of the pro-
letariat is already established in the U.S.S.R. and is a factor
of world signiﬁcance, the movement for liberation in colonial
and semi-colonial countries, which was brought into being by
the penetration of world capitalism, may lead to Socialist develop-
ment—notwithstanding the immaturity of social relationships in
these countries taken by themselves—provided they receive the
assistanceand support of the proletarian dictatorship and of the
international .proletarian movement generally.

period of struggle required for the democratic dictatorship of
the proletariat and the peasantry and for the transformation
of this dictatorship into the dictatorship of the proletariat, and,
"finally, the decisive importance of the national aspects of the
struggle, impose upon the Communist Parties of these countries
a number of special tasks, which are preparatory stages to the
general tasks of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Com-
munist International considers the following to be the most im-
portant of these special tasks:

1. To overthrow the rule of foreign imperialism, of the
feudal rulers and of the landlord bureaucracy.

2. To establish the democratic dictatorship of the proleta-
riat and the peasantry on a Soviet basis.

3. Complete national independence and national uniﬁcation.
4. Annulment of State debts.

5. Nationalization of large-scale enterprises (industrial, trans-
port, banking and others), owned by the imperialists.

6. The confiscation of landlord, church and monastery lands.
The nationalization of all the land.

7. Introduction of the 8-hour day.

8. The organization of revolutionary workers’ and peasants’
armies.

In the colonies and semi-colonies where the proletariat is the
leader of and commands hegemony in the struggle, the con-
sistent bourgeois-democratic revolution will grow into proleta-
rian revolution—in proportion as the struggle develops and be-
comes more intense (sabotage by the bourgeoisie, conﬁscation of
the enterprises belonging. to the sabotaging section of the hour-
geoisie, which inevitably » extends to the nationalization of the

"whole of large-scale industry). In the colonies where there is

no proletariat, the overthrow of the domination of the impe-
rialists implies the establishment of the rule of people’s (peas-

foreign enterprises and lands.

Colonial revolutions and movements for national liberation.
play an extremely important part in the struggle against im-
perialism and in the struggle for the conquest of power by the
working class. Colonies and semi-colonies are also important
in the transition period because they represent the world rural
district in relation to the industrial countries, which represent
the world city. Consequently, the problem of organizing Social-
ist world economy, of properly combining industry with agri-
culture is, to a large extent, the problem of the relation to-
wards theiformer colonies of imperialism. The establishment of
a fraternal, militant alliance with the masses of the toilers in the
colonies represents one of the principal tasks the world industrial
proletariat must fulﬁll as leader in the struggle against im-
perialism.

Thus, in rousing the workers in the home countries for the
struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat, the progress of
the world revolution also rouses hundreds of millions of colonial
workers and peasants for the struggle against foreign imperial-
ism. , In View of the existence of centres of Socialism represented
by Soviet Republics of growing economic power, the colonies
which break -away from imperialism economically gravitate to-
wards and gradually combine with the industrial centres of world
Socialism, are drawn into the channel of Socialist construction,
and by skipping the further stage of development of capitalism,
as the predominant system, obtain opportunities for rapid eco-
nomic and cultural progress. The Peasants’ Soviets in the back-
ward ex-colonies and the Workers’ and Peasants’ Soviets in
the "more developed ex-colonies group themselves politically
around the centres of proletarian dictatorship, join the growing
Federation of Soviet Republics, and thus enter the general sys-
tem of the world proletarian dictatorship.

Socialism, as the new method of production, thus obtains
world-wide scope of development.

V. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat in the U.S.S.R.
and the International Social Revolution

l.’ THE BUILDING UP OF SOCIALISM IN THE U. S. S. R. ANl) THE‘

CLASS STRUGGLE

I-IE principal manifestation of the profound crisis of the
capitalist system is the division of world economy into capi-
talist countries on the one hand, and countries building up
Socialism on the other. Therefore, the internal consolidation of
the proletarian dictatorship in the U. S. S. R., the success

achieved in the work of Socialist construction, the growth of

the influence and authority of the U. S. S. R. among the masses
of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of_the colonies sig-
nify the continuation, intensiﬁcation and expansion of the Inter-
national Social Revolution. 1

Possessing in the country the necessary and suiﬁcient ma-
terial prerequisites not_only for the overthrow of the landlords
and the bourgeoisie, but also for the establishment of complete

V Socialism, the workers of the Soviet Republic, with the aid of

the international proletariat, heroically repelled the attacl<s- of
the armed forces of the internal and foreign counter-revolution,
consolidated their alliance with the bulk of the peasantry and
achieved considerable success in the sphere of Socialist con-
struction.

The contacts established between proletarian Socialist indus-
try and small peasant economy, which stimulates the growth of

~ the productive forces of agriculture and at the same time as-
sures the leading role to Socialist industry; the linking up ‘of ‘

industry with agriculture in place of the former capitalist pro-
duction for the satisfaction of the unproductive consumption of
parasitic classes; production, not for capitalist proﬁt, but for the
satisfaction of the growing needs of the masses of the consum-

61

‘ers; the growth of the needs of the masses, which in the ﬁnal

  

analysis greatly stimulates the entire productive process; and
ﬁnally, the close concentration of the economic key positions
under the command of the proletarian State, the growth of

‘planned management and the more economic and expedient

distribution of the means of production that goes with it—all
this enables the proletariat to make rapid progress along the

'road of Socialist construction.

    

In raising the level of the productive forces of the whole
economy of the country, and in steering a straight course for
the industrialization of the U. S. S. R.—the rapidity of which
is dictated by the international and internal situation, the pro-
letariat in the U. S. S. R., notwithstanding the systematic at-
tempts on the part of the capitalist powers to organize an eco-
nomic and ﬁnancial boycott against the Soviet Republics, at the
same time increases the relative share of the socialized (So-
cialist) sector of national economy in the total means of pro-
duction in the country, in the total output of industry and in the
total trade turnover.

Thus, with the land nationalized, by means of the levers of
State trade and rapidly growing co-operation,‘ and with the in-
creasing industrialization of the country, State Socialist indus-
try, transport and banking are more and more guiding the
activities of the small and very small peasant enterprises.

In the sphere of agriculture especially, the level of the forces
of production is being raised amidst conditions that restrict
the process of diﬁerentiation among the peasantry (nationaliza-
tion of the land, and consequently, the prohibition of the sale
and purchase of land; sharply graded progressive taxation; the
ﬁnancing of poor and middle peasants’ co-operative societies
and producers’ organizations; laws regulating the hiring of
labor; depriving the l<ulal<s of certain political and public rights;
organizing the rural poor in separate organizations, etc.). How-
ever, insofar as the productive forces of Socialist industry have

62

 

not yet grown sufficiently to enable a broad, new technical
base to be laid for agriculture and, consequently, to render pos-
sible the immediate and rapid uniﬁcation of peasant enterprises
into large public enterprises (collective farms), the kulak class
tends to grow and establish, first economic, and then political
contacts with the elements of the ‘so-called "new bourgeoisie.”

Being in command of the principal economic key positions

in the country and systematically" squeezing out the remnants

of urban and private capital, which has greatly dwindled in
the last few years of the “New Economic Policy”; restricting
in every way the exploiting strata in the rural districts that
arise out of the development of commodity and money relation-
ships; supporting existing Soviet farms in the rural districts
and establishing new ones; drawing the bulk of the peasant
simple commodity producers, through the medium of rapidly

growing co-operative organizations, into the general system of .
Soviet economic organization, and consequently into the work

of Socialist construction, which in the conditions prevailing
under the proletarian dictatorship and with the economic leader-
ship of Socialist industry is identical with the development of

Socialism; passing from the process of restoration to the process

of expanded reproduction of the entire productive and technical
base of the country—the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. sets itself,
and is already beginning to fulﬁll the task of large-scale capital
construction (production of means of production generally, de-
velopment of heavy industry and especially of electriﬁcation)
and, developing still further, selling, buying and credit'co-opera-
tion, sets itself the task of organizing the peasantry in producing
co-operatives on a mass scale and a collectivist basis, which calls
for the powerful material assistance of the proletarian State.

Thus, being already a decisive economic force determining,
in the main, the entire economic development of the U.S.S.R.,
Socialism, by that very fact, makes still further strides in its
development and systematically overcomes the diﬂiculties that

63

    

 
 

arise ~from the petty-bourgeois character of the country and the
periods of temporarily acute class antagonisms.

The task of re-equipping industry and the need for large
investments in capital construction, unavoidably give rise to
serious diﬂiculties in the path of Socialist development which,
in the last analysis, are to _be attributed to the technical and
economic backwardness of the country and to the ruin caused
in the years of the imperialist and civil wars. Notwithstanding
this, however, the standard of living of the working class and
of the broad masses of the toilers is steadily rising and, simul-
taneously with the Socialist rationalization and scientiﬁc organ-
ization of industry, the 7-hour day is gradually being intro-
duced, which opens up still wider prospects for the improvement
of the conditions of life and labor of the working class.

"Standing on the basis of the economic growth of the U.S.S.R.
and on the steady increase in the relative importance of the
Socialist sector of its economy; never for a moment halting the
struggle against the kulaks; relying upon the rural poor and
maintaining a ﬁrm alliance with the bulk of the middle peas-
antry, the working class, united and led by the Communist
Party, which has been hardened in revolutionary battles, draws
increasing masses, scores of millions of toilers into the work of
Socialist construction. The principal means employed towards
this aim are: the development of broad mass organizations (the
Party, as the guiding force; the trade unions, as the backbone
of the entire system of the proletarian dictatorship; the Young
Communist League; co-operative societies of all types; working
women’s and peasant women’s organizations; the various so-called
“voluntary societies”; worker and peasant correspondents’ so-
cieties; sport, scientiﬁc, cultural and educational organizations);
full encouragement of the initiative of the masses and the pro-
inotion of fresh strata of workers to high posts in all spheres of
industry and administration. The steady attraction of the masses
into the process of Socialist construction, the constant renovation
of the entire State, economic, trade union and Party apparatus
with men and women fresh from the ranks of the proletariat,

64

 

 

 

the systematic training, in the higher educational institutions
and at special courses, of workers generally and young workers in
particular as new, Socialist experts in all branches of construc-
tion——all these together serve as one of the principal guarantees
against the bureaucratic ossiﬁcation and social degeneration of the
stratum of the proletariat directly engaged in administration.

2. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE U.S.S.R. AND HER .W70Ri'..D
REVOLUTIONARY DUTIES

Having defeated Russian imperialism and liberated all’ the
former colonies and oppressed nations of the Tsarist Empire,
and systematically laying a firm foundation for their cultural and
political development, by industrializing their territories; having
guaranteed the juridical position of the Autonomous Territories,
Autonomous Republics and Allied Republics in the Constitution

of the Union and having granted in full the right of nations to ‘

self-determination—the dictatorship of the proletariat in the
U.S.S.R., by this guarantees, not only formal, but also real
equality for the different nationalities of the Union. I

Being the land of the dictatorship of the proletariat and of
Socialist construction, the land of great working class achieve-
ments, of the union of the workers with the peasants and of a
new culture marching under the barmer of Marxism—the
U.S.S.R. inevitably becomes the base of the world movement
of all oppressed classes, the centre of international revolution,
the greatest factor in world history. In the U.S.S.R., the world
proletariat for the first time acquires a country that is really its
own, and for the colonial movements the "U.S.S.R. becomes a
powerful centre of attraction. —

Thus, the U.S.S.R. is an extremely important factor in the
general crisis of capitalism, not only because she has dropped
out of the world capitalist system and has created a basis for
a new Socialist system of production, but also because she plays
an exceptionally great revolutionary role generally; she is the
international driving force of proletarian revolution that impels

65

    

 
 

the proletariat of all countries to seize power; she is the living
example proving that the working class is not only capable of
destroying capitalism, but of building up Socialism as well; she
is the prototype of the fraternity of nationalities in all lands
united in the World Union of Socialist Republics and of the
economic unity of the toilets of all countries in a single world
Socialist economic system that the world proletariat must estab-
lish when it has captured political power.

~The simultaneous existence of ‘two economic systems: the
Socialist system in the U.S.S.R., and the capitalist system in
other countries, imposes on the proletarian State‘ the task of
wardingoff the blows showered upon it by the capitalist world
(boycott, blockade, etc.), and also compels it to resort to eco-
nomic maneuvering with and utilizing economic contacts with
capitalist countries (with the aid of the monopoly of foreign
trade—which is one of the fundamental conditions for the sucw
cessful building up of Socialism, and also with the aid of credits,
loans, concessions, etc.). The principal and fundamental line
to be followed in this connectionmust be the line of establishing
the widest possible contact with foreign countries—within limits
determined by their usefulness to the U.S.S.R., i. e., primarily
for strengthening industry in the U.S.S.R., for laying the base
for her own heavy industry and electrification and ﬁnally, for
the development of her own Socialist engineering industry. Only
to the extent that the economic independence of the U.S.S.R.,
in the capitalist environment is secured can solid guarantees be
obtained against the danger that Socialist construction in the
U.S.S.R. may be destroyed and that the U.S.S.R. may be trans-

formed into an appendage of the world capitalist system.

On the other hand, notwithstanding their interest in the
markets of the U.S.S.R., the capitalist States continually vacil-
late between their commercial interests and their fear of the
growth of the U.S.S.R., which means the growth of international
revolution. However, the principal and fundamental tendency
in the policy of the imperialist powers is to encircle the U.S.S.R.

66

 

and to conduct counter-revolutionary war against her in order
to strangle her and to establish a world bourgeois terrorist regime.

The systematic imperialist attempts politically ,to encircle the
U.S.S.R. and the growing danger of an armed attack upon her,
do not, however, prevent the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union—a section of the Communist International and the leader
of the proletarian dictatorship in the U.S.S.R.—from fulﬁlling
its international obligations and from rendering support to all
the oppressed, to the labor movements in capitalist countries, to

colonial movements against imperialism and to the struggle_

against national oppression in every form.

3. THE DUTIES OF THE INTERNATIONAL PROLETARIAT TO THE
U. S. S. R.

In view of the fact that the U.S.S.R. is the only fatherland
of the international proletariat, the principal bulwark of its
achievements and the most important factor for its international

emancipation, the international proletariat must on its part facili-i

tate the success of the work of Socialist construction in the
U.S.S.R. and defend her against the attacks of the capitalist
powers by all the means in its power.

“The world political situation has made the ‘dictatorship
of the proletariat an immediate issue, and all the events of
world politics are inevitably concentrating around one central
point, namely,\the struggle of the world bourgeoisie against
the Soviet Russian Republic, which must inevitably group
around itself the Soviet movements of the advanced work-
ers of all countries on the one hand, and all the national
liberation movements of the colonial and oppressed nation-
alities on the other.” (Lenin)

In the event of the imperialist States declaring war upon and
attacking the U.S.S.R., the international proletariat must retaliate
by organizing bold and determined mass action and struggling

67

Introduction

THE epoch of imperialism is the epoch of moribund capitalism.
The world war of 1914-1918 and the general crisis of capital-
ism to which it led, being the direct result,of the sharp contradic-

‘ tions between the growth of productive forces of world economy

and the national State barriers which intersect it, have shown and
proved that the material prerequisites for Socialism have already
ripened in the womb of capitalist society, that the shell of capital-
ismvhas become an intolerable hindrance to the further develop-
ment of mankind and that history has brought to the forefront
the task of the revolutionary overthrow of the yoke of capi-
talism. V .
‘ Imperialism subjects large masses of the proletariat of all coun-
tries—from- the centers of capitalist might to the most remote
corners of the colonial world—to the dictatorship of the ﬁnance-
capitalist plutocracy. With elemental force, imperialism exposes
and accentuates all the contradictions of capitalist society; it
carries class oppression to the utmost limits, intensifies the strug-
gle between capitalist governments, inevitably gives rise to world-
wide imperialist wars that shake the whole prevailing system of
relationships to their foundations and inexorably leads .to the
world proletarirm revolution. ~ »
Binding the whole world in chains of ﬁnance-capital, forcing
its yoke upon the proletariat and the nations and races of all

countries lb methods of blood, iron and starvation, shar enin to '
a Y P g

an immeasurable degree the exploitation, oppression and enslave-
ment of the proletariat and confronting it with the immediate
task of conquering power—imperialism createsthe necessity for
closely uniting the workers of all countries, irrespective of State
frontiers and of diiferences of nationality, culture, language,
race, sex or profession in a single international army of the pro-
letariat. Thus, while imperialism develops and completes the

. process of creating the material prerequisites for Socialism, it at

5

    

  

for the overthrow of the imperialist governments with the slogan
of: Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Alliance with the U.S.S.R.

In the colonies, and particularly the colonies of the imperialist
country attacking the U.S.S.R., every effort must be /made to
take advantage of the diversion of the imperialist military forces
to develop an anti-imperialist struggle and to organize revolu-
tionary action for the purpose of throwing 0E the yoke of im-
perialism and of winning complete independence.

The development of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. and the growth
.of its international inﬂuence not only rouse the hatred of the
capitalist States and the social-democratic agents against her, but
also inspire the toilets all over the world with sympathy towards
her and stimulate the readiness of the oppressed classes of all
countries to ﬁght with all the means in their power for the land
of the proletariat dictatorship, in the event of an imperialist at-
tack upon her.

\ Thus, the development of the contradictions within modern
world economy, the development of the general capitalist crisis.
and the imperialist military attack upon the Soviet Union in-
evitably lead to a mighty revolutionary outbreak which must
overwhelm capitalism in a number of the so-called civilized
countries,_ unleash the victorious revolution in the colonies.
broaden the base of the proletarian dictatorship to an enormous
degree and thus, with tremendous strides, bring nearer the final
world victory of Socialism.

 

VI; The Strategy and Tactics of the Communist
International in the Struggle for the Dictatorship
of the Proletariat . A

1. IDEOLOGIES AMONG THE WORKING CLASS INIMICAL T0
— COMMUNISM

N its ﬁght against capitalism for the dictatorship of the pro-
letariat, revolutionary Communism encounters numerous
tendencies within the working class, which to a greater or lesser
degree express the ideological subordination of the proletariat to
the imperialist bourgeoisie, or reflect the ideological influence
exercised upon the proletariat by the petty-bourgeoisie, which at

. times rebels against the shackles of ﬁnance/capital, but is incap-

able of adopting sustained and scientiﬁcally planned strategy
and tactics or of carrying on the struggle in an organized manner
on the basis of the stern discipline that is characteristic of the
proletariat.

The mighty social power of the imperialist State, with ‘its
auxiliary apparatus—schools, press, theatre and church—-is pri-
marily reflected in the existence of confessional and reformist
tendencies among the working class, which represent the main
obstacles on the road towards the proletarian social revolution.

The Confessional, religiously tinged tendency among the work-
ing class ﬁnds expression in the confessional trade unions, which
frequently are directly connected with corresponding bourgeois
political organizations and are aﬂiliated one or other of the church
organizations of the dominant class (Catholic trade unions, Young
Men’s Christian Association, Jewish Zionist organizations, etc.).
All these tendencies, being the most striking product of the
ideological captivity of certain strata of the proletariat, in most
cases, bear a romantic feudal tinge. By sanctifying all the
abominations of the capitalist regime with the holy water of
religion, and by terrorizing their ﬂock with the spectre of punish-

69

  

ment in the world to come, the leaders of these organizations
serve as the most reactionary units of the class enemy in the camp
of the proletariat.

A cynically commercial, and imperialistic secular form of sub-
jecting the proletariat to the ideological inﬂuence of the bour-
geoisie is represented by contemporary "Sociali5t” reformism.
Taking-its main gospel from the tablets of imperialist politics,
its model today is the deliberately anti-Socialist and openly coun-
ter-revolutionary "American Federation of Labor.” The “ideolo-
gical” dictatorship of the servile American trade union bureau-
cracy, which in its turn expresses the “ideological” dictatorship
of the American dollar, has become, through the medium of

-British reformism and His Majesty’s Socialists of the British

    

Labor Party, the most important constituent in the theory and
practice of international social democracy and of the leaders of
the Amsterdam International, while the leaders of German and
Austrian social democracy embellish these theories with Marxian
phraseology in order to cover up their utter betrayal of Marxism.
“Socialist” reforrnism, the principal enemy of revolutionary Com-
munism in the labor movement, which has abroad organizational
base in the social-democratic parties and through these in the
reformist trade unions, in its entire policy and theoretical out-
look stands out as a force directed against the proletarian revo-
lution.

In'the sphere of foreign politics, the social-democratic parties
actively supported the imperialist war on the pretext of “defend-

 

ing the fatherland.” Imperialist expansion and “colonial policy”.

received their wholeheartecl support. Orientation towards the
counter-revolutionary _ “Holy Alliance” of imperialist powers
("The League of Nations”), advocacy of “ultra-imperialism,”
mobilization of the masses under pseudo-paciﬁst slogans, and at
the same time, active support of imperialism in its attacks upon
the U.S.S.R. and in the impending war against; the U.S.S.R.-
are the main features of reformist foreign policy.

In the sphere of home politics, social democracy has set itself

70

the task of directly cooperating with and supporting the capitalist
regime. Complete support for capitalist rationalization and stab-
ilization, class peace, “peace in industry”; the policy of con-
verting the labor organizations into organizations of the employ-
ers and of the predatory imperialist State; the practice of so-called
“industrial democracy” which in fact means complete subordina-
tion to trustiﬁed capital; adoration of the imperialist State and

particularly of its false democratic labels; active participation in ~

the building up of the organs of the imperialist State-——police,
army, gendarmerie, its class judiciary; the defense of the State,
against the encroachments of the revolutionary Communist pro-
letariat and the executioner’s role social democracy plays in time’
of revolutionary crisis—such is the line of reformist home policy.
While pretending to conduct the industrial struggle, reformism
considers its function in this ﬁeld to be to conduct that struggle-
in such. a manner as to guard the capitalist class against any’
kind of shock, or at all events, to preserve the complete inviol-
ability of the foundations of capitalist property.

In the sphere of theory, social democracyxhas utterly and com-
pletely betrayed Marxism, having traversed the road from revision-
ism to complete liberal ‘bourgeois reformism and avowed social-
imperialism: it has substituted in place of the Marxian theory
of the contradictions of capitalism, the bourgeois theory of its
harmonious development; it has pigeonholed the theory of crises
and of the pauperization of the proletariat; it has turned the
flaming and menacing theory of class struggle into prosaic ad-
vocacy of class peace; it has exchanged the theory of growing
class antagonisms for the petty-bourgeois fairy-tale about the
“democratization” of capital; in place of the theory of the
inevitability of war under capitalism it has substituted the bour-
geois deceit of paciﬁsm and the lying propaganda of “uItra-im-
perialism”; it has exchanged the theory of the revolutionary down-
fall of capitalism for the counterfeit coinage of "sound” capitalism
transforming itself peacefully into Socialism; it has replaced
revolution by evolution, the destruction of the bourgeois State

71

by its active upbuilding, the theory of proletarian dictatorship by
the theory of coalition with the bourgeoisie, the doctrine of inter-
national proletarian soliclarity—by preaching defense of the im-
perialist fatherland; for Marxian dialectical ‘materialism it has
substituted the idealist philosophy and is now engaged in picking
up the crumbs of religion that fall from the table of the bour-
geoisie.

\ Within social-democratic reformism a number of tendencies
stand out that are characteristic of the bourgeois degeneracy of

‘ the social democracy.

Constructive Socialism (MacDonald 86 Co.), which, by its very
name suggests the struggle against the revolutionary proletariat
and a favorable attitude towards the capitalist system, continues
the liberal philantropic, anti-revolutionary and bourgeois tradi-
tions of Fabianism (Beatrice and Sydney Webb, Bernard Shaw,
Lord Oliver, etc.). While repudiating the dictatorship of the
proletariat and the use of ‘violence in the struggle against the
bourgeoisie as a matter of principle, it favors violence in the
struggle against the‘ proletariat and the colonial peoples. While
acting as the apologists of the capitalist State and preaching
State capitalism under the guise of Socialism, and, in c‘onjunc-

tion with the most vulgar ideologists of imperialism in both hemi- _

spheres, declaring the theory of the class struggle to be a “pre-
scientiﬁc” theory, “Constructive Socialism” ostensibly advocates
a moderate program of nationalization with compensation, taxa-
tion of land values, death duties, and taxation of surplus proﬁts
as a means for abolishing capitalism. Being resolutely opposed
to the dictatorship of the proletariat in the U.S.S.R., “Construc-
tive Socialism,” in complete alliance with the bourgeoisie—is an
active enemy of the Communist proletarian movement and of
colonial revolutions.

A special variety of “Constructive Socialism” is "Cooperativ-
ism,” or "Cooperative Socialism” (Charles Gide, Totomyantz 85
Co. , which also stron 1 re udiates the class stru le and ad-

_ g Y . _ gg
vocates the cooperative orgamzation of consumers as a means of

'72

overcoming capitalism, but which in fact does all it can to help the
stabilization of capitalism. Having at its command an extensive
propagandist apparatus, in the shape of the mass consumers’
cooperative organizations, which it employs for the purpose of sys-
tematically inﬂuencing the masses, “Cooperativism” carries on a
ﬁerce struggle against the revolutionary labor movement, hampers
it in_ the achievement of its aims and represents today one of
the most potent factors in the camp of the reformist counter-
revolution. S ,

So-called “Guild Socialism” (Penty, Orage, Hobson and others)
is an eclectic attempt to unite “revolutionary” syndicalism with
bourgeois liberal Fabianism, anarchist decentralization ("national
industrial guilds”) with State capitalist centralization and medi-
aeval guild and craft narrowness with modern capitalism. Start-
ing out with the ostensible demand for the abolition of the “wage
system” as an “immoral” institution which must be abolished by
means of workers’ control of industry, Guild Socialism completely
ignores the most important question, viz., the question of power.
While striving to unite workers, intellectuals, and technicians into
a federation of national industrial “guilds” and to convert these
guilds by peaceful means (“control from within”) into organs for
the administration of industry within the framework of the bout-
geois State, Guild Socialism actually defends the bourgeois State,
obscures its class, imperialist and anti-proletarian character and
allots to it the function of the non-class representative of the in-
terests of the “consumers” as against the guild organized “pro-
ducers.” By its advocacy of “functional democracy,” i.e., repre-
sensation of classes in capitalist society—each class being presumed
to have a deﬁnite social and productive function, Guild So-
cialism paves the way for the fascist "Corporate State.” By
repudiating both parliamentarism and “direct action,” the majority
of the Guild Socialists doom the working class to inaction and
passive subordination to thebourgeoisie. Thus, Guild Socialism
represents a peculiar form of trade unionist utopian opportunism
and, as such, cannot but play an anti-revolutionary role.

73

  

Lastly, Austro-Marxism represents a special variety of social-
democratic reformism. Being a part of the “Left-wing” of social

‘democracy, Austro-Marxism represents a most subtle deception of

    

the masses of the toilers. Prostituting the terminology of Marx-
ism, while divorcing themselves entirely from the principles of
revolutionary Marxism (the Kantism, Machism, etc., of the
Austro—Marxists in the domain of philosophy), toying with reli-
gion, borrowing the theory of “functional democracy” from the
British reformists, agreeing with the principle of “building up
the Republic,” i.e., building up the bourgeois State, Austro-
Marxism recommends “class cooperation” in periods of so-called
"equilibrium of class forces,” i.e., precisely at the time when the
revolutionary crisis is maturing. This theory is a justiﬁcaton‘of
coalition with the bourgeoisie for the overthrow ofvthe proletarian
revolution under the guise of defending “democracy” against
the attacks of reaction. Objectively, and in practice, the violence
which Austro-Marxism admits in cases of reactionary attack is
converted into reactionary violence against the proletarian revo-
lution. Hence, the “functional role” of Austro-Marxism is to
deceive the workers already marching towards Communism, and
therefore it is the most dangerous enemy of the proletariat, more
dangerous than the avowed adherents of predatory social impe-
rialism.

All the above-mentioned tendencies, being constituent parts of
“Socialist” reformism, are agencies of the imperialist bourgeoisie
within the working class itself. But Communism has to contend
also against a number of petty-bourgeois tendencies, which reﬂect
and express the vacillation of the unstable strata of society (the
urban petty-bourgeoisie, the degenerate city middle class, the
slum proletariat, the declassed Bohemian intellectuals, the pauper-
ized artisans, certain strata of the peasantry, etc., etc.). These
tendencies, which are distinguished for their extreme political
instability, often cover up a Right wing policy with Left wing
phraseology or drop into adventurism, substitute noisy political
gesticulation for objective estimation of forces and often tumble

74

 

from astounding heights of revolutionary bombast to profound
depths of pessimism and downright Capitulation before the
enemy. Under certain conditions, particularly in periods of sharp
changes in the political situation and of forced temporary retreat,
these tendencies may become very dangerous disrupters of the
proletarian ranks and consequently, a drag upon the revolutionary
proletarian movement.

Anarchism, the most prominent representatives of which
(Kropotkin, Jean Grave and others) treacherously went over to
the side of the imperialist bourgeoisie in the war of 1914-1918,
denies the necessity for wide, centralized and disciplined proletar-
ian organizations and thus leaves the proletariat powerless before
the powerful organizations of capital. By its advocacy of in-
dividual terror, it distracts the proletariat from the methods of
mass organization and mass struggle. By repudiating the dic-
tatorship of the proletariat in the name of “abstract” -liberty,
anarchism deprives the proletariat of its most important and
sharpest "weapon against the bourgeoisie, its armies, and all its
organs of repression. Being remote from mass movements of any
kind in the most important centres of proletarian struggle, Anar-
chism is steadily being reduced to a sect which, by its tactics and
actions, including its opposition to the dictatorship of the work:
ing class in the U.S.S.R., has objectively joined the united front
of the anti-revolutionary forces.

“Revolutionary” Syndicalism, many ideologists of which, in
the extremely critical war period went over to the camp of the
fascist type of “anti-parliamentary” counter-revolutionaries, or
became peaceful reformists of the social-democratic type, by its
‘repudiation of A political struggle (particularly of revolutionary
parliamentarism) and of the revolutionary dictatorship of the
proletariat, by its advocacy of the craft decentralization of the
labor movement generally and of the trade union movement in
particular, by its repudiation of the need for a proletarian party,
and of the necessity for rebellion, and by its exaggeration of the
importance of the general strike (the “folded arm tactics”), like

75

Anarchism, hinders the revolutionization of the masses of the
workers wherever it has any inﬂuence. Its attacks upon the
U.S.S.R., which logically follow from its repudiation of dictator-
ship of the proletariat in general, place it in this respect on. a‘
level with social democracy.

All these tendencies take a common stand with social democ-
racy, the principal enemy of the proletarian revolution, on the
fundamental political issue, viz., the question of the dictatorship
of the proletariat. Hence, all of them come out more or less
deﬁnitely in a united front with social democracy against the
U.S.S.R‘. On the other hand, social democracy, which has ut-

terly and completely betrayed Marxism, tends to rely more and

more upon the ideology of the Fabians, of the Constructive So-
cialists and of the Guild Socialists. These tendencies are be-
coming transformed into the official liberal-reformist ideology
of the «bourgeois “Socialism” of the Second International.

In the colonial countries and among the oppressed peoples and
races generally, Communism encounters the inﬂuence of peculiar
tendencies in the labor movement which played a useful role in
a deﬁnite phase of development, but which, in the new stage
of development, are becoming transformed into a reactionary
force.

San-Yat-Senism in China expressed the ideology of petty-
bourgeois democratic “Socialism.” In the “Three Principles”
(nationalism, democracy, Socialism), the concept “people” ob-
scured the concept “classes”; Socialism was presented, not as a
specific mode of production to be carried on by a speciﬁc class,
i.e~. by the proletariat, but as a vague state of social well-being,
while no connection was made between the struggle against im-
perialisrn and the perspective of the development of the class
struggle. Therefore, while it played a very useful role in the first
stage of the Chinese revolution, as a consequence of the further
process of class differentiation that has taken place in the coun-

‘try and of the further progress of the revolution, Sun-Yat-Senism‘

76

has now changed from being the ideological expression of the
development of that revolution into fetters of its further develop-
ment. The epigones of Sun-Yat-Senism, by emphasizing and
exaggerating the very features of this ideology that have become
objectively reactionary, have transformed it into the official
ideology of the Kuomintang, which is now an openly counter-
revolutionary force. The ideological growth of the masses of the
Chinese proletariat and of the toiling peasantry must therefore
be accompanied by determined decisive struggle against the Kuo-
mintang deception and by opposition to the remnants of the
Sun-Yat-Senist ideology.

Tendencies like Gandhi-ism in India, thoroughly inmbued
with religious conceptions, idealize the most backward and
economically most reactionary forms of social life, see the solu-
tion of the social problem not in proletarian Socialism, but in a
reversion to these backward forms, preach passivity and repudiate
the class struggle, and in the process ofithe development of the
revolution become transformed into an openly reactionary force.
Gandhi-ism is more and more becoming an ideology directed
against mass revolution. It must be strongly combatted by
Communism.

Garveyism, which formerly was the ideology of the Negro
small property owners and worker: in America, and which even
now exercises some inﬂuence over the Negro masses, like Gandhi-
ism, has become a hindrance to the revolutionization of the Ne-
gro masses. Originally advocating social equality for Negroes,
Garveyism subsequently developed into a peculiar form of Ne-
gro “Zionism” which, instead of ﬁghting American imperialism,
advanced the slogan: “Back to Africa”! This dangerous ideology,
which bears not a single genuine democratic trait, and which
toys with the aristocratic attributes of "a non-existent “Negro
kingdom,” must be strongly resisted, for it is not a help but a
hindrance to the mass Negro struggle for liberation against
American imperialism.

Standing out against all these tendencies is -Proletarian Com-
‘ 77

    

 
 

the same time musters the army of its own grave-diggers and
compels the proletariat to organize in a militant international
workers’ association.

On the other hand, imperialism splits off the best-provided-for
section of the working class from the main mass of the workers.
Bribed and corrupted by imperialism, this upper stratum of the
working class constitutes the leading element in the social-demo-
cratic parties; it is interested in the imperialist plunder of the
colonies, is loyal to. its own bourgeoisie and “its own” imperialist
State, and, in the midst of decisive battles, ﬁghts on the side of
the class enemy of the proletariat. The split that occured in the
Socialist movement in 1914 as a result of this treachery, and the
subsequent treachery of the social-democratic parties, which in
reality have become bourgeois labor parties, demonstrated that the
international proletariat will be able to fulﬁll its historical mis-
sion—to throw oil: the yoke of imperialism and establish the
proletarian dictatorship—only by ruthless struggle against social
democracy. Hence, the organization of the forces of the in-
ternational revolution becomes possible only on the platform of
Communism. In opposition to the opportunist Second Interna-
tional of social-democracy—which has become the agency of im-
perialism in the ranks of the working class—inevitably rises the
Third Communist International, the international organization
of the working class, the embodiment of real unity of the revo-
lutionary workers of the whole world. 4

The war of 1914-1918 gave rise to the first attempts to estab-
lish a new, revolutionary International, as a counterpoise to the
Second, social-chauvinist International, and as a weapon of resist-
ance to bellicose imperialism (Zimmerwald and Kienthal) . The
victorious proletarian revolution in Russia gave an impetus to the
formation of Communist Parties in the centres of capitalism and
in the colonies. In 1919, the Communist International was
formed, and for the first time in world history the-most advanced
strata of the European and American proletariat were really united
in the process of practical revolutionary struggle with the pro-

6

 

  

munism- The powerful ideology of the international revolu-
tionary working class; it differs from all these tendencies, and
primarily from social democracy, in that in complete harmony
with the teachings of Marx and Engels, it conducts a theoretical
and practical revolutionary struggle for the Dictatorship of the
Proletariat, and in the struggle applies all forms of proletarian
mass action.

2. THE FUNDAMENTAL TASKS OF COMMUNIST STRATEGY AND
‘ TACTICS

The successful struggle of the Communist International for
the dictatorship of the proletariat presupposes the existence in
every country of a compact Communist Party, hardened in the
struggle, disciplined, centralized, and closely linked up with the
masses.

The Party is the vanguard of the working class and consists
of the best, most class-conscious, most active, and most courageous
members of that class. It incorporates the whole body of ex-
experience of the proletarian struggle. Basing ‘itself upon the

\ revolutionary theory of Marxism and representing the general

    

and lasting interests of the whole of the working class, the
Party personiﬁes the unity of proletarian principles, of proletarian
will and of proletarian revolutionary action. It is a revolutionary
organization, bound by iron discipline and strict revolutionary
rules of democratic centralism, which can be carried out thanks
to the class-consciousness of the proletarian vanguard, to its loyalty
to the revolution, its ability to maintain inseparable ties with
the proletarian masses and to its‘ correct political leadership, which
is constantly verified and clariﬁed by the experiences of the masses
themselves.

In order that it may fulfill its historic mission of achieving
the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Communist Party must
ﬁrst of all set itself and accomplish the‘ following fundamental
strategic aims:

78

 

Extend its inﬂuence over the majority of members of its own
class, including working women and the working youth. To
achieve this the Communist Patty must secure predominant in-
ﬂuence in the broad mass proletarian organizations (Soviets,
trade unions, factory committees, cooperative societies, sport organ-
izations, cultural organizations, etc.). It is particularly important
for the purpose of winning over the majority of the proletariat,
to capture the trade unions, which are genuine mass working-
class organizations closely bound up with the everyday strug-
gles of the working. class. To work in reactionary trade unions
and skillfully to capture them, to win the conﬁdence of the broad
masses of the industrially organized workers, to change and
"remove from their posts” the reformist leaders, represent im-
portant tasks in the preparatory period.

The achievement of the dictatorship of the proletariat pre-
supposes also that the proletariat acquires hegemony over wide
section: of the toiling masses. To accomplish this the Commu-
nist Party must extend its inﬂuence over the masses of the urban
and rural poor, over the lower strata of the intelligentsia and
over the so-called “small man,” i.e. the petty-bourgeois strata
generally. It is particularly important that work be _carried on
for the purpose of extending the Party’s inﬂuence over the
peasantry. The Communist Party must secure for itself the
whole-hearted support of that stratum of the rural population
that stands closest to the proletariat, i.e. the agricultural laborers
and the rural poor. To this end, the agricultural laborers must
be organized in separate organizations; all possible support must
be given them intheir struggles against the rural bourgeoisie, and
strenuous work must be carried on among the small allotment
farmers and small peasants. In regard to the middle strata of
the peasantry in developed capitalist countries, the Communist
Parties must conduct a policy to secure their neutrality. The
fulfillment of all these tasks by the proletariat,—the champion
of the interests of the whole people and the leaders of the broad
masses in their struggle against the oppression of finance capital,

79

—is an essential condition precedent for the victorious "Com-
munist revolution.

The tasks of the Communist International connected with the
revolutionary struggle in colonies, semi-colonies and dependencies
are extremely important strategic tasks in the world proletarian
struggle. The colonial struggle presupposes that the broad
masses of the working class and of the peasantry in the colonies
be rallied around the barmer of the revolution; but this cannot
be achieved unless the closest cooperation is maintained between
the proletariat in the oppressing countries and the toiling masses
in the oppressed countries.

While organizing, under the banner of the proletarian dic-
tatorship, the revolution against imperialism in the so-called
civilized States, the Communist International supports every
movement against imperialist violence in the colonies, semi-
colonies and dependencies themselves (for example Latin-Amer-
ica); it carries on propaganda against all forms of chauvinism
and against the imperialist maltreatment of enslaved peoples and
races, big and small (treatment of Negroes, “yellow labor,”
anti-semitism, etc.), and supports their struggles against the
bourgeoisie of the oppressing nations. The Communist Inter-
national especially combats the chauvinism that is preached in the
Empire-owning countries by the imperialist bourgeoisie as well
as by its social-democratic agency, the Second International, and
constantly holds up in contrast to the practices of the imperialist
bourgeoisie the practice of the Soviet Union, which has established
relations of fraternity and equality among the nationalities in-
habiting it. i

The Communist Parties in_ the imperialist countries must render
systematic aid to the colonial revolutionary liberation movement
and to the movement of oppressed nationalities generally. The
duty of rendering active support to these movements rests pri-
marily upon the workers in the countries upon which the op-
pressed nations are economically, financially or politically de-
pendent. The Communist Parties must openly recognize the

80

right of the colonies to separation and their right to carry on
propaganda for this separation, i.e. propaganda in favor of the
independence of the colonies from the imperialist State; they must
recognize their right of armed defense against imperialism (i.e.
the right of rebellion and revolutionary war) and advocate and
give active support to this defense by all the "means in their
power. The Communist Parties must adopt this line of policy
in regard to all oppressed nations.‘

The Communist Parties in the colonial and semi-colonial coun-
tries must carry on a bold and consistent struggle against foreign
imperialism and unfailingly conduct propaganda in favor of
friendship and unity with the proletariat in the imperialist coun-
tries. They must openly advance, conduct propaganda for and
carry out the slogan of agrarian revolution, rouse the broad masses
of the peasantry for the overthrow of the landlords and combat
the reactionary and mediaeval influence of the clergy, of the
missionaries and other similar elements.

In these countries, the principal task is to organize the work-
ers and the peasantry independently (to establish class Commu-
nist Parties of the proletariat, trade unions, peasant leagues and
committees and, in a revolutionary situation, Soviets, etc.) and
to free them from the influence of the national bourgeoisie, with
whom temporary agreements may be made only on the condi-
tion that they, the bourgeoisie, do not hamper the revolutionary

C organization of the workers and peasants, and that they carry on

a genuine struggle against imperialism.

In determining its line of tactics, each Communist Party must
take into account the concrete internal and external "situation,
the correlation of class forces, the degree of stability and strength
of the bourgeoisie, the degree of preparedness of the proletariat,
the position taken up by the various intermediary strata in its
country, etc. The Party determines its slogans and methods of

_ctruggle in accordance with these circumstances, with the View
, to organizing and_ mobilizing the_masses on the broadest possible

scale and on the highest possible level of this struggle.
81

When a revolutionary situation is developing, the Party ad-
- vances certain transitional slogans and partial demands corres-
ponding to the concrete situation; but these demands and slogans
must be bent to the revolutionary aim of capturing power and of
overthrowing bourgeois capitalist society. The Party must neither
stand aloof from the daily needs and struggles of the working
class not conﬁne its activities_ exclusively to them. The task of
the Party is to utilize these minor every-day needs as a starting
point from which to lead the working class to the revolutionary
struggle for power. V
When the revolutionary tide is rising, when the ruling classes
are disorganized, the masses are in a state of revolutionary
ferment, the intermediary strata are inclining towards the pro-
letariat and the masses are ready for action and for sacrifice,
the Party of the proletariat is confronted with the task of lead-
ing the masses to a direct attack upon the bourgeois State. This
it does by carrying on propaganda in favor of increasingly radical
transitional slogans (for Soviets, workers’ control of industry,
for peasant committees for the seizure of the big landed prop-
erties, for disarming the bourgeoisie and arming the proletariat,
etc.), and by organizing mass action, upon which all branches
of the Party agitation and propaganda, including parliamentary
activity, must be concentrated. This mass action. includes: a
combination of strikes and demonstrations; a combination of
strikes and armed demonstrations and ﬁnally, the general strike
conjointly with armed insurrection against the State power of the
bourgeoisie. The latter form of struggle, which is the supreme
form, must be conducted according to the rules of war; it pre-
supposes a plan of campaign, offensive ﬁghting operations and
unbounded devotion and heroism on the part of the proletariat.
An absolutely essential condition precedent for this form of action
is the organization of the broad masses into militant units, which,
by their very form, embrace and set into action the largest pos-
sible numbers of toilers (Councils of Workers’ Deputies, Soldiers’
Councils, etc.), and intensiﬁed revolutionary work in the army
and the navy.

82

In passing over to new and more radical slogans, the Parties
must be guided by the fundamental role of the political tactics
of Leninism, which call for ability to lead the masses to revolu-
tionary positions in such a manner that the masses many, by their
own experience, convince themselves of the correctness of the
Party line. Failure to observe this rule must inevitably lead to
isolation from the masses, to putschism, to ‘the ideological degen-
eration of Communism into “Leftist” dogmatism and to petty-
bourgeois “revolutionary” adventurism. Failure to take advantage
of the culminating point in the development of the revolutionary
situation, when the Party of the proletariat is called upon to
conduct a bold and determined attack upon the enemy, is not
less dangerous. To allow that opportunity to slip by and to fail
to start rebellion at that point, means to allow the initiative to
pass to the enemy and to doom the revolution to defeat.

When the revolutionary tide is not rising, the Communist»
‘Parties must advance partial slogans and demands that cor-

respond to the every-day needs of the toilets, and combine them
with the fundamental tasks of the Communist International. The
Communist Parties must not, however, at such a time, advance
transitional slogans that are applicable only to revolutionary situa-
tions (for example workers’ control of industry, etc.). To ad-
vance such slogans when there is no revolutionary situation means
to transform them into slogans that favor merging with the capi-
talist system of organization. Partial demands and slogans gen-
erally form an essential part of correct tactics; but certain transi-
tional slogans go inseparably with a revolutionary situation. Re-
pudiation of partial demands and transitional slogans “on prin-
ciple,” however, is incompatible with the tactical principle of
Communism, for in effect, such repudiation condemns the Party
to inaction and isolates it from the masses. United front tactics
also occupy an important place in the tactics of the Communist
Parties throughout the whole pre-revolutionary period as a means
towards achieving success in the struggle against capital, towards
the class mobilization of.the masses and the exposure and isolation
of the reformist leaders.
83

The correct application of united front tactics and the ful-
ﬁllment of the general task of winning over the masses presup-
poses in their turn systematic and persistent work in the trade
unions and other mass proletarian organizations. It is the bounden
duty of every Communist to belong to a trade union, even a
most reactionary one, provided it is a mass organization. Only
by constant and persistent work in the trade unions and in the
factories for the steadfast and energetic defense of the interests
of the workers, together with ruthless struggle against the re-
formist bureaucracy, will it be possible to win the leadership
in the workers’ struggle and to win the industrially organized
workers over to the side of the Party.

Unlike the reformists, whose policy is to split the trade unions,
the Communists defend trade union unity nationally and inter-
nationally on the basis of the class struggle, and render every
support to and strengthen the work of the Red International
of Labor Unions.

In universally championing the current every-day needs of
the masses of the workers and of the toilers generally, in utiliz-
ing the bourgeois parliament as a platform for revolutionary
agitation and propaganda, and subordinating the partial tasks

to the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Parties A

of the Communist International advance partial demands and
slogans in the following main spheresz.

In the sphere of labor, in the narrow meaning of the term,
i.e. questions concerned with the industrial struggle (the ﬁght
against the trustiﬁed capitalist offensive, wage questions, the
working day, compulsory arbitration, unemployment), which grow
into questions of the general political struggle (big industrial
conﬂicts, ﬁght for the right to organize, right to strike, etc.); in
the sphere of politics proper (taxation, high cost of living, Fas-
cism, persecution of revolutionary parties, white «- terror and cur-
rent politics generally); and ﬁnally the sphere of world politics;
viz., attitude towards —the U.S.S.R. and colonial revolutions,
struggle for the unity of the international trade union movement,

84

"UH-1':"‘UaUIAp-cu-—-._....

struggle against imperialism and the war danger, and systematic
preparation for the ﬁght against imperialist war.

In the sphere of the peasant problems, the partial demands
are those appertaining to taxation, peasant mortgage‘ indebted-
ness, struggle against usurer’s capital, the land hunger of the
peasant small holders, rent, the metayer (crop-sharing) system.
Starting out from these partial needs, the Communist Party
must sharpen the respective slogans and broaden them out into
the slogans: conﬁscation of large estates, and workers’ and peas-
ants’ government (the synonym for proletarian dictatorship in
developed capitalist countries and for democratic dictatorship of
the proletariat and peasantry in backward countries and in certain
colonies).

Systematic work must also be carried on among the proletarian
and peasant yout/7 (mainly ‘through the Young Communist In-
ternational and its sections) and also among working women and
peasant women. This work must concern itself with the special
conditions of life and struggle of the working and peasant women,
and their demands must be linked up with the general demands
and ﬁghting slogans of the proletariat.

In the struggle against colonial oppression, the Communist
Parties in the colonies must advance partial demands that cor-
respond to the special circumstances prevailing in each country
such as: complete equality for all nations and races; abolition of

all privileges for foreigners; the right of association for workers,

and peasants; reduction of the working day; prohibition of child
labor; prohibition of "usury and of all transactions entailing
bondage; reduction and abolition of rent; reduction of taxation;
refusal to pay taxes, etc. All these partial slogans must be sub-
ordinate to the fundamental demands of the Communist Parties
such as: complete political national independence and the expul-
sion of the imperialists, workers’ and peasants’ government, the
land to the whole people, eight-hour day, etc. The Communist
Parties in imperialist countries, while supporting the struggle
proceeding in the colonies, must carry on a campaign in their own

85

respective countries for the withdrawal of imperialist troops, con-
duct propaganda in the army and navy in defense of the op-
pressed countries ﬁghting for their liberation, mobilize the masses
to refuse to transport troops and munitions and, in connection
with this, to organize strikes and other forms of mass protest, etc.

The Communist International must devote itself especially to
systematic preparation for the struggle against the danger of
imperialisf wars. Ruthless exposure of social chauvinism, of social
imperialism and _of pacifist phrasemongering intended to cam-
ouflage the imperialist plans of the bourgeoisie; propaganda in

. favor of the principal slogans of the Communist International;

every-day organizational work in connection with this, ‘in the
course of which work legal methods must unfailingly be com-
bined with illegal methods; organized work in the army and
navy—such must be the activity of the Communist Parties in this
connection. The fundamental slogans of the Communist Inter-
national in this connection must be the following: Convert impe-
rialist war into civil war; defeat the “home” imperialist govern-
ment; defend the U.S.S.R. and the colonies by every possible
means in the event of imperialist war against them. It is the
bounden duty of all Sections of the Communist International,
and of every one of its members, to carry on propaganda for
these slogans, to expose the “Socialistic” sophisms and the “So-
cialist” camouflage of the League of Nations and constantly to
keep to the front the experiences of the war of 1914-1918.

In order that revolutionary work. and revolutionary action may
be coordinated and in order that these activities may be guided
most successfully, the international proletariat must be bound by
international class discipline, for which, first of all, it is most
important to have the strictest international discipline in the
Communist ranks. I

The international Communist discipline must find expression
in the subordination of the partial and local interests of the
movement to its general and lasting interests and in the strict

86

fulﬁllment, by all members, of the decisions passed by the lead-
ing bodies of the Communist International.

rUnlil<e the Social-Democratic, Second International, each sec-
tions of which submits to the discipline of "its own,” national
bourgeoisie and of its own “fatherland,” the sections of the
Communist International submit to only one discipline, viz.,
international proletarian discipline, which guarantees victory in
the struggle of the world’s workers for world proletarian dictator-
ship. Unlike the Second International, which splits the trade
unions, ﬁghts against" colonial peoples, and practices unity with
the bourgeoisie, the Communist International is an organization
that guards proletarian unity in all countries, and the unity of
the toilers of all races and all peoples in their struggle against
the yoke of imperialism.

Despite the bloody terror of the bourgeoisie, the Communists
ﬁght with courage and devotion on all sectors of the international
class front, in the ﬁrm conviction that the victory of the pro-
letariat is inevitable and cannot be averted.

"The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.
They openly declare that their aims can be attained only by the
forcible overthrow of all the existing social conditions. Let the
ruling class tremble at a Communist revolution. The proletarians
have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.

"Workers of all countries, unite!” t

87

 

letariat of China and India and with the colored toilers of
Africa and America.

As the united and centralized international Party of the pro-
letariat, the Communist International is the only Party to con-
tinue the principles of the First International, and to carry them
out upon the new mass foundation of the revolutionary prole-
tarian movement. The experience gathered‘ from the first impe-
rialist war, from the subsequent period of revolutionary crises of
capitalism, from the series of revolutions in Europe and in the
colonial countries;- the experience gathered from the dictatorship
of the proletariat and the building up of Socialism in the
U.S.S.R. and from the work of all the Sections of the Com-
munist International as recorded in the decisions of its Con-
gresses; finally, the fact that the struggle between the imperialist
bourgeoisie and the proletariat is more and more assuming an
international character—all this creates the need for a uniform
program of the Communist International that shall be common
for all Sections of the Communist International. This program
of the Communist International, being the supreme critical gen-
eralization of the whole body of historical experience of the in-
ternational revolutionary proletarian movement, becomes the
program of struggle for the world proletarian dictatorship, the
program of struggle for world Communism.

Uniting, as it does, the revolutionary workers, who lead the
millions of oppressed and exploited against the bourgeoisie and
its “Socialist” agents, the Communist International regards itself.
as the historical successor to the “Communist League” and the-.
First International led by Marx, and as the inherito: of the best.
of the pre-war traditions of the Second International. The First:
International laid the ideological foundation for the international
proletarian struggle for Socialism. The Second International, in
the best period of its existence, prepared the ground for the ex-
pansion of the labor movement among the masses. The Third
Communist International, in continuing the work of the First
International, and in accepting the fruits of the work of the
Second International, resolutely lopped oif the latter’s opportun-

letariat, for the establishment of a World Union of Socialist
Soviet Republics, for the complete abolition of classes and for
the achievement of Socialism—the first stage of Communist
society. '

mittees may appoint the subordinate committees and coopt mem-
bers on their own committees, subject to subsequent endorse-
ment by the competent superior Party committees.

tions and in their leading committees (trade unions, co-operative
societies, sport organizations, ex-service men’s organizations, and
