truth. We scaled Otterbach, took ten more pill-boxes, and sixty-five prisoners in three
hours. Goff and the Colonel were elated. The job was done. I got the white flag at the

summit.

Beside the topmost pill-box was a German grave. We sat beside it during the
night and watched Bergzabern below on fire as the battle continued fiercely on our

right flank.

Out of a platoon of about thirty-eight men twelve finished the battle. Wounded
and KIAs made up the absentees. A crazed GI was picked- up by combat MPs twenty
kilometers to the rear. He was wandering around beserk in the woods.

‘We spent a comfortable night sleeping in Jerry’s. topmost fortress. The next
morning, clear and sunny, we could see shining white dragon's teeth in a long, snaky
line for miles.. A battle was still going on, but subdued. Our dive-bombers’ were on a
target and shaking the ground with bombexplosions.

We came down off Otterbach in high spirits. A couple of us were wearing silk-
toppers picked up at the bottom of the hill as we marched back to another assembly
point, in stagger formation. A movie cameraman took our picture as we came under the
arch on the Franco-German border. Inscribed overhead was something like: “You
are now entering Germany by courtesy of the 142nd Regiment, 36th Division.

Burned out Jerry tanks and trucks and buses littered the road. A body, obviously
of a German tanker, lay on the road, burned to a crisp. It was about four feet long
with one charred arm pointing in the air. A GI from Louisiana went‘ over and urinated
on it profusely and with gusto. For a flush moment, at least, a unit of the master race
got along swimmingly.

The East and West Fronts were closing in on the Wehrmacht, sandwiching in
German troops in an ever-narrowing corridor. Montgomery, Simpson, Patton, Hodge
and Patch were breaking through everywhere. Uncle Joe’s men were on a rampage
across the way and. the 69th embraced them at Torgau on the Elbe. The 36th thundered
into Bavaria sweeping up swine on the way.

My regiment snatched up Horthy, Rundstedt, Goering, two Air Marshalls,
Frank, and Max Amann, publisher of Mein Kampf.

It _was blood and mud all the way down the home-stretch until V-E Day. We
crossed into Kufstein, Austria on May 5th. White flags were everywhere, from
tab1e—cloths to underwear.

With a tanker captain I went behind Jerry's loosening lines as an interpreter.
we were accompained by an Austrian partisan, and a German major. Three thousand
Jerries wanted to surrender, and we were supposed to negotiate the terms. And in
Schloss It_ter, a castle near Soll, Daladier, Reynaud, King Leopold of Belgium, De-
Gaulle’s sister, and, Gene Borotra, the French tennis star, were prisoners. We were
supposed to effect their rescue. The SS raided the castle at night and the German
Magor was killed.  weakened bridge prevented our armor from getting through and
we were sweating it out until the next day when the infantry arrived. “E” Company
pushed through to us and went on to the castle. A French touring car took the re-
leased captives back to France.

AMBUSH IN THE AUSTRIAN TYROL

Weaving our way into the mountains with “F” Company leading the battalion,
we were ambushed by SS troops. Scouting Jeeps were ahead picking their way gingerly,
followed by tanks. Everything seemed serene. I lay asleep on the second tank, my
pack and rifle beside me. An 88 shell came in and knocked out the lead- tank. I woke up,

IV

LIBERATION IN TURKHEHVI

“MASELTOV!”

On May 14th the 36th returned to Turkheim, Bavaria, for occupation duty.

It was a neat little town. Its normal native population was swelled by
Jews from every European country who were released by our troops from con-
centration camps on the outskirts. These Jews, male and female alike, were the most
grotesque figures I ever saw. They walked across the face of Twentieth Century history,
hulking examples of man's inhumanity to man.

They wore blue and white perpendicular-striped concentration camp uniforms.
Here and there one managed to have a cast-off pair of civilian trousers or skirt,
matched by the weird K-Z outtfits. The clothing literally flapped around their skeletal
frames.

All had oversized heads on undersized bodies. It seemed a wonder that the
mammoth heads could be supported by the pipe-stems that passed off as necks. Huge
blue or brown orbs, in the place of eyes, were set in sunken sockets. They had horribly
caved-in cheeks and jutting cheek-bones. Spindle shanks and bony arms with skin
drawn‘ tight for a covering made a gruesome contrast to the bloated stomachs of the
half—starved. Tattered fragments of blue-and-white cloth were pinned to lapel or
breast designating Jewish faith. It was a scene from Dante’s Inferno. _

Jewish women from Auschwitz were branded with blue numbers on their fore-
arms. One gir1’s breasts were severed. Her flat figure and bloated stomach gave her
a lop-sided appearance and made one drop the eyes in shame. Here and there strolling
couples were holding each other up with sheer effort. They were all searching for friends
and relatives and for news of their families. One couldn’t help comparing them with
the well-fed and healthy Germans on the street.

Our guys were silent and ashamed. We gave the refugees everything not tied
down—-clothing, blankets, socks, shoes, candy, soap, and cigarettes.

Despite the somber scene there was an air of gaiety about the town. Liberation
and the spirit of Freiheit was dynamic, intermingled with hope that loved ones would
soon be found alive. .

_ Our platoon was billeted in a Weinstube. Spit"-and-polish soldiers now, Gls
were prettying up and frolicking around like bear cubs. Some of the men were singing
“Lily Marlene” under a makeshift shower. Ugly purple scars on their naked torsos
were mementoes of battles from Salerno to Austria.

Nicholson was cutting hair outside and taking a good deal of ribbing from GIs
sitting against the house awaiting their turn. They reminded‘ him to administer an-
esthesia when they came up. Others lounged about drinking in the sunshine and feeling
strangely aglow. No more sleeping in the snow. Hitting the hay in “Long Johns”
again was the combat man's dream. When Jerry cried, “Uncle” we had it really “made.”

After fighting and lingering on the border of eternity for so long and knowing
that another sunrise would see us alive and kicking, we felt liberated, too. We, and
the Jews, felt a common bond. Our mutual enemy was no more. The whole world was
free. '

I MEET FRIEDEL

Two girls, very emaciated and sickly-looking, strolled by the Weinstube. They
appeared about fifteen years of age. Their arms, interlocked, and bare legs, seemed
all bone. Both had protruding stomachs as though they were carrying. Their en-
ormous eyes set in sunken faces, gave them an awesome appearance. Adorned in
odds and ends of clothing neither could have weighed over eighty-five pounds.

Bowman and I introduced ourselves. Their names were Friedel and Franka.
The latter carried a cannister of rationed milk obtained from a local Bauer. Franka
was a Polish Jew and Friedel, German. Friedel said that only a handful of German
Jews survived the lagers. Himmler-’s extermination plans called first for the execution
of the intelligentsia and geschaft Jews of which,Germany had a large population. Most
of the survivors were from the Balkans and from the workingclass of Poland.

We handed them some GI chocolate. Most of our soap, at a premium in Europe,
had already been distributed to other refugees. I asked where they lived. Not under-
standing her answer Friedel wrote an address on the ground with a stick.

“202 Oberjagerstrasse bei Mayer,” she wrote.

Bowman and I visited them at their home that afternoon in a secluded part
of town. Frau Mayer let us in and escorted us to a room off the corridor. Both Franka

9:,/, ..

 

  

and Friedel were lying on a mattress on the floor smoking cigarettes we had given
them earlier in the day. They arose quickly as we entered.

It seemed strange to see young girls smoking who didn’t appear over fifteen.
They laughed when I mentioned it. In the camps the internees smoked grass rolled up
in German newsprint. Franka said wryly: “The grass tasted better than the German
propaganda.” A cigarette brought half a loaf of black bread in the camp blackmarket.

We deposited on the table a raft of chocolate, cigarettes, soap, and matches——
all legal tender in Germany. They had never eaten a piece of chocolate for years.
Perfumed soap was unheard of, and cigarettes were out of this world.

All during combat, since I didn’t smoke, my rations went to the French people
and the slave laborers whom we liberated. These items were in turn bartered_for food
and 'other necessities. We used to see ragged children hang around our billets for

hours for a piece of chocolate and delve into GI garbage cans behind the mess. It
became a common sight.

ESCAPE ON THE DEATH MARCH

Just before liberation Friedel’s sister became seriously ill in Turkheim. She be-
came incoherent and finally fell into a stupor .Those were Friedel’s darkest days. The
camp was agog; liberation was in the air. The Americans were fighting at Aschaffenburg
and coming closer every day. The girls had survived seven years of terror together.
Regina could not leave her now. Friedel nursed her twin desperately and fed her hot
soup and part of her own rations. She talked to her hours on end, informing her that
the Americans were coming. Regina came to just before the camp was roused for the
march to Dachau.

Every Jew knew about Dachau. It was the end of the road, the last shuttle-
stop. The extermination drive was being stepped up and all subsidiary lagers were
funneling humanity into Dachau camp where over the entrance was the inscription:
“Arbeit Macht Frei” (Work Makes One Free.) And the stench of burning ﬂesh gave
the lie to innocently-protesting townspeople for miles around who claimed they knew
nothing of the death-mill.

The Seventh Army was twenty-four hours away. Breakdown of German trans-
portation saved the lives of all Turkheim internees who did not succumb on the
march. It was a motley crew of blue-and-white tatterdemalions that began that hike
of death. Every Jew knew it was now or never.

SS guards on every side kept close check on the marchers. Jews of every
European nation were there; once-beautiful Hungarian Jewish women with their ovaries
extracted, pauperized Jews from Poland, cultured Jews from Vienna, middle-class
Jews from Germany. The undernourished men and women tired! quickly. Some
straggled and were shot immediately. Friend helped friend. Some were carried and
others were half-dragged by loved ones. The SS men were on a time schedule. It
was keep pace or die.

Knowing that certain death awaited her Friedel planned to escape. She told
Regina of her plan. At a turn in the road she stooped to tie her shoe. As others marched
past she half-expected a bullet in her back at any moment. Then she rolled down the
eniibankment and into the underbrush. She summoned all the strength in her frail
bo y.

The guards yelled commands. Shots rang out. Screams rent the air. Friedel ran
swiftly as she used to in the school races at Dusseldorf. She reached the woods and
blended into its foilage. She kept running and running, never stopping not knowing
her destination. The yells grew fainter and she finally fell to the ground limp, and
gasping for her breath. She lay there in the underbrush until dusk.

She heard twigs snapping and girlish voices only a few yards away. Struggling
to her feet, she parted the bushes, and gave a little cry of joy. It was Regina and
Franka.

When Friedel scurried into the woods the SS stopped the column. The turmoil
that followed her take-off was the cue for mass flight. The screams were those of some
of the unlucky ones.

SANCTUARY AT FRAU MAYER’S

That night the girls slept huddled together in the woods under a blanket of
leaves hoping that the Americans would arrive by morning. They awoke early shiver-
ing from the dewy cold. A slight fog had not yet lifted. It would act as a screen
while they reconnoitered. Treading warily they came to the edge of the woods. Across
an open field was a dirt road and several farmhouses. In their blue-and-white K-Z
uniforms they would be instant prey for Bavarian farmers.

Friedel stopped and held up her hand. From the distance came a rumble of
heavy vehicles over a hard-surfaced road and rushing through the town. Not sure that

‘a

they were Americans, but with more confidence, they started off across the field_ A
farmer went by and the girls hit the ground. They ran the remainder of the distance
across the field until they reached the bushes lining the road. From this vantage point
they looked about. They needed food, new clothing, and sleep. The rumble of swift,
heavy vehicles was incessant-

A woman came out of the nearest farmhouse with a basket of washing. The
girls crossed the road and went through the iron gate. The woman turned. Gently
reared, the three girls were nevertheless prepared to defend themselves to the last
if the Bavarian housewife should cry out. In horror she raised her hand to her mouth
as if to stifle a scream. She saw three emaciated bits of blue-and-white, slowly and
grimly advancing toward her.

“Are those the Americans?” Friedel asked. The woman nodded her head and
began to cry. The girls were free.

Frau Mayer brought them into the house, gave them food, warm milk, and
prepared a bath for them. Friedel fainted dead away and was assisted into bed. The
others were given beds in a side-room. When they awoke arrangements were made
to take them to a hospital and Frau Mayer offered her home upon their discharge.
They were released the day before we arrived in Turkheim.

Some of the Jewish folk chose to live in homes while others remained at the
camp. Hoffman, the brutal SS Lagerfuehrer, was still in command of the camp but
a concerted protest by the inmates forced his arrest.

The Jews were yet on meager rations. The “town Jews” walked a mile to the
camp once daily to pick up their food in buckets and tin pails. Regina went every
day to the camp and Friedel collected the milk rations in the town.

Regina came in with the food as her sister related her story. They asked Bowman
and I to eat with them. We begged off, embarrassed. They lunched on a hodge-podge
of sour milk, cream cheese, black bread, and a small piece of meat floating in potato
soup. The cigarettes we proferred, gave them a feeling of luxurious ease.

Bowman always carried a harmonica. Regina was elated. She hadn’t seen one
for a long time. She borrowed it and began to play expertly. While Friedel and
Franka lay on the mattress they sang Jewish and German songs. Regina sat on a
chair beating time with her foot.

They sang the military songs of the Nazis and went through renditions of
“Die Fahne Hoch,” (The Flag Flies High), “Wir Fahren Gegen England” (We’re
Sailing Against England), “Die Horst iWesse1 Lied” (The Horst Wessel Song), and
“Rosamunda,” which was the German tune for our “Beer Barrel Polka.” We chimed
in in English while they sang in German. Then Bowman played “Lily Marlene"
while the girls and I sang. They had sweet, harmonizing voices. It was a_ joyful
afternoon for all of us. I marvelled at the merriment exhibited by these young girls
whose lives were so cruelly disrupted by an inhuman ideology.

ABHRODITE GOES TO TOWN

The next day I went to a Musik Geschaft and bought three harmonicas for
Regina. Visiting several farmers and a Metzgerei I traded my bountiful cigarettes for
eggs and meat. One cigarette brought one egg on the Tauschhandel bourse. A fraction
of a Mark and a cigarette or two got you a pound of choice steak. At the Backerei
a loaf of warm bread was a bargain. for the baker in exchange for a piece of chocolate.

Loaded with fresh eggs, steaks, bread, and lettuce, I stumbled into Frau Mayer’s
home. The refugees stood speechless as I dropped the groceries on the table. Nobody
can understand» the sense of elation I felt as platters of sizzling steak and’ eggs, fried
by Frau Mayer, were literally devoured by the undernourished waifs. Every moment
for me was the elixir of life I would not trade for a king’s ransom. I vowed that they
would never go without the necessities of life as long as my outfit stayed in Turkheim.
It would be my hobby to take care of them until their lives were readjusted.

I played» first base on the company soft ball team but found it interfered with
my new job so I quit.

Although Friedel was getting stronger she was addicted to fainting spells and
bad nightmares. Several times she passed out before my eyes. A German doctor nearby
was always handy for a fistful of cigarettes.

For one month I brought food every day. Frau Mayer’s was my real home. I
altered the girls’ diet with liverwurst, chunks of German salami, and wieners. For
the usual GI goodies they were also suppliedwith plenty of fresh milk. One evening
after drill I brought in a five-pound brick of cheese. They had salads and vegetables,
and nourishing soup. Sometimes there was some extra fruit preserves left over at the
mess tent and the girls found them a delicacy.

11

 

Jewish friends always kept dropping in. Some were newly—discharged from the
hospital. Some related joyous stories of finding loved ones. Other tales were not so
happy when they learned that a husband or a friend had been executed. The stories
of deaths following in the wake of the long-sought-for liberation were hardest to

bear
My German had improved considerably. Tl”) MONTHS AFTER’ LIBERATION

Carrying on a conversation went beyond the
usual little snatches of words. Though my
diction must have seemed frightful to others
I pushed ahead with undisguised aplomb.
Friedel corrected me often. VVhen I said,
“viel gut” (much good) in answer to her salu-
tations in the evening, she corrected me, “sehr
gut, (very good) she’d say. Learning a new
word or phrase in the army dictionary was
always good for a peal of delight from the
girls. When I became too precocious they
sometimes conversed in Polish. I usually show-
ed my pique then. It was becoming dangerous
for them to relate private matters. But they’d
soothe me with a song or two.

Many German songs belonged to my
repertoire by now. “Komm Zuruck” (Come
Back.) was a favorite. Then there were “Zwei
Guitarren Am Meer” (Two Guitars On The
Sea), “Die Hawaii Lied” (Song of Hawaii),
and “Muttilein” (Mother). Friedel wrote out
the songs in German and we all sang while
Regina played the harmonica. Sometimes
there were four of us GIs and four girls in
that small room singing at the top of our
lungs. Frau Mayer and her neighbors must
have had tantrums.

Friedel, June, 1945
“ . . . cheeks began filling out.”

We could not venture outdoors. “Frat” patrols were always on the loose.
‘.‘Chicken” officers and “Ninety-day Wonders” were turning guys in all the time.
We resented army regulations lumping Jewish refugees with German frauleins.

Friedel’s condition was improving, her cheeks began filling out and assuming
a ruddier-look. This, seemingly, decreased the size of her eyes. Arms and legs lost
their bony appearance. The collar bones did not "protrude so much. A Jerry watch
I gave her still slid down the heel of her palm and jiggled around her wrist. She
seemed older as her body became padded with flesh.

MOON-STRUCK IN BAVARIA

It goes without saying that I was very fond of Friedel. She knew it, the girls
knew it, and the guys knew it. It was something entirely new for her. She was the most
genuinely-shy creature ever. Love was an undeveloped facet of her life.

I was already married in the States but it had always been a completely in-
compatible existence. Every evening on returning from a hard day’s work, I threw
my cap in the door and waited for it to fly out again. Before joining the service I
had reached the end of my matrimonial tether. Although I wrote dutiful letters home
my marriage was a washout and done with. I could never return to its bitter realities.

It was however, a cruel revelation for Friedel. Complications were bound
to set in. For years it was to haunt my every waking hour. Being moostruck in
Bavaria was a little on the doltish side, but there it was, and what could you do
aboutit

Bringing her health up to par was my first obsession. Finding her people was
the next. A Britisher had already taken a message to England to locate her sister,
Martha.

Any attempted interruption in my appointed task to restore Friedel’s health
was met with opposition. They sent me to Mindelheim to become) an MP, but I
begged off and returned. They sent me to Munich on a sight-seeing tour but I
chafed at the bit until I returned to Turkheim. Hikes, drills, inspections, were
undisguised torment. At every spare hour I tore away to take care of her.

Then came the alert to break camp. All the GIs had become attached to
Turkheim in the one month we were there. The frat ban was lifted for one night and

we were allowed a dance at the Weinstube near our billets. It was intensely enjoyed
by Friedel. We felt free, and in the evening we took a walk down by the river where
the soldiers went swimming during the day.

V

PYGMALION’S STATUE TAKES FORM

KIRCHHEIM-UNTER—TECK

Our outfit moved to Wiblingen about ninety kilometers north. Two weeks later
we jumped to Kirchheim, near Stuttgart. Friedel sent me a note. I returned three
times to see her. Ill and ‘despondent, she was admitted to the hospital at Bad
Worishofen. It was impossible for her to remain at Frau Mayer's. It was a torture
for her when I didn’t show up in the evening and there was no singing or banter.

doctor's care but her ailment was nothing he studied about in medical school.

Vv‘e decided to stick it out together. Military Government issued her a pass and
I got her a home with a German banker not far from the company. By pre-arrangement,
Dr. Hendersson, a German-Jewish physician in Wiblingen, brought her to Kirchheim
in his car_

Since I was busy when Friedel arrived, the guys entertained her. They were
cleaning their rifles for an inspection on the lawn by our billets and foisting their
mongrelized German on her. She enjoyed the whole show.

“A1les Nazis viel kaput!”_ they were yelling and brandishing their M-ls. “Boom,
boom! Alles kaput!” They pantomimed our weaving through the trenches at Otter-
bach, then mimicked surrendering Germans: “Nix schiessen! Nix schiessen! Alles
kaput, Kamerad!” Friedel was in spasms.

We were due for quite a stay in Kirchheim. Regina was well enough to travel
so she took off for Dusseldorf and the DP camps in search of the family. I was trans-
ferred to Military Intelligence at Battalion as an interpreter. It was a good deal.
Every morning I attended the Regimental Intelligence school and in the afternoons
alternated with seven others on jeep patrols to twenty surroundings towns. Our job
was to interrogate the Burgomeister, arrest suspects, collect surrendered weapons,
and to lead surprise battalion operations in. house-to-house searches. Our staff didn’t
fall out for drill or formation. Many of my afternoons were free and I spent them with
Friedel.

The officer in charge of DPs at MG headquarters refused to increase Friedel’s
rations. “We do not favor one group over the other,” he perorated. “MG treats
Germans and Jews alike.

“You mean to say sir, that a German who has lived off the plunder of Europe
for seven years, and a Jewish girl who has been undernourished for seven years, are
to be considered equal?”

“Yes.” His sexy—looking German secretary seemed to derive great amusement
from the exchange.

In addition to her meager Lebensmittel rations I arranged one evening meal
for Friedel at a restaurant on Hindenburgstrasse in exchange for cigarettes, and

peas, carrots, white GI bread, jello, cookies, cake, and pie.

For drinks I brought her iced tea, coffee, cocoa, and milk. Sometimes the jello
melted and dribbled on the meat and vegetables but Friedel didn’t mind. After the
K-Z lagers she was in a gourmet’s paradise.

Each morning I awakened her and brought her wholesome cereals, fried eggs,
buttered toast, fruits, and coffee. Her Highness received the best a combination but-
ler and male nurse could administer.

There was enough food for her coterie of girl friends who visited her con-
stantly from various DP centers in the US Zone. One evening I brought twenty
pounds of native plums for both her and a girl chum. The next day I was horrified to
learn that the whole mess was devoured overnight as _they laid in bed reminiscing.

She laid in the sun all day in abbreviated clothing, or slept on the lawn behind
the house, or went on bicycle excursions. Every evening we went together to the
restaurant followed by a stroll around town. The frat ban on Jewish DPs was finally
lifted semi-officially so we encountered no difficulties. .

Watching Friedel as she ate was the most exhilarating recreation. Every ounce
of food, every drop of milk, added weight to her slender frame. She filled out mir-

13

aculously——and in the right places. It was in Kirchheim that she became a young wo-
man with poise. No longer was she the emaciated waif of Turkeim who stumbled across
Frau Mayer's field. It dawned on me all of a sudden that she had become grown up.

Her brown eyes achieved an enervating sparkle and her brown hair, which
she groomed meticulously, assumed a pleasant sheen. She had no more the grotesque,
bony appearance. The cheeks had filled out completely and were tanned. Her features
were refined. In the short space of four months it was like taking a mask off her face
The calves of her legs were now a graceful contour and her hips full and easy-
swinging.

I fell head-over-heels. Nazi vandals tried to destroy the statue, but I helped re-
build it. Jo Davidson, himself, couldn’t have done a better job.

FRAU ROSENTHAL GOES TO THE GAS CHAMBERS

In Turkheim Friedel had horrible nightmares, almost all of them a recurrence
of one experience—the death of her mother. She slept alone in the room with the
light on. The nightmares became less frequent. The last occurrence was in Wiblingen.
Dr. Hendersson said she knocked herself out one night and he had to administer a hypo-
dermic.

One night after duty, I was hopping up the stairs to her room, two at a time,
with a pint of ice cream as a surprise. I had just located a place about ten kilometers
away where ice cream was made with army stocks. It was melting when I rushed
into her room. As I stepped inside I became unnerved at what I saw. Friedel was
screaming and her bed was a shambles. She lay punching the pillow and bed clothes
violently. “Verﬂuchte Nazi Schwein! Komm zuruck, Mutti!” She was tossing about,
her underclothing drenched with perspiration and clinging to her body. Her face ran
little rivulets of sweat. .

In 1942 there was a big extermination drive against the Jews. Batches of wo-
men were being taken out of Czestochowa lager and put into yawning box-cars for
the trip to the gas chambers at Treblinka, Poland. There, the women were system-
atically stripped naked, their clothing placed in separate piles, one for shoes, another
for dresses, etc. Rings and jewelry were likewise confiscated.

The naked women were then herded into a room where they were given a hot
shower. This was to open their pores to receive the deadly Evipan gas pouring through
the small openings in the ceiling. The room had small glass windows on the side
through which observers peered to watch the last writhings of the victims.

When the gas had done its job, the victims’ gold teeth and bridgework were ex-
tracted. Their hair was cut, to be used for pillows for German Hausfraus. Then the
bodies were taken to the nearby ovens. Each body was then inserted into the oven on
a movable frame as though it was a loaf of bread. When the victims died with arms
and legs outstretched the limbs had to be broken in order to fit into the small oven
apertures. The crowning humiliation arose from the fact that the ovens were tended
by Jews who would eventually have their lives terminated in the same manner, and
then replaced by others. Ashes of victims were sent to relatives in a small container
already paid for; and it didn’t matter whose ashes went to whom. Most of the ashes
were used for fertilizer in fields of sugar beet. When the first liberation soldiers took
over éhese camps, they marched over a powdery, gray substance spread for acres
aroun .

Friedel told me the story once before:

“On a Sunday in October, 1942, the SS men were making up a transport for
Treblinka. My mother was very fond of Regina and me, as we were the last of her
six children. She kept hoping that we would be allowed to live even though it might
be as a house-servant for the Germans_ All the women were lined up in a long line,
wailing and sobbing. An SS captain with a walking-stick tapped every third women for
the gas chamber. Two to the right, one to the left. Hour after hour we saw the fiend
pronounce the death sentence on every third person by a light tap with his walking-
stick. Two to the right, one to the left. When the captain touched my mother we began
to drag her with us. The guards beat Regina and me over the head with rubber
truncheons and tore her away. The last words we heard her say were: ‘Save your-
selv_es, my babies! You are still young!’ In dire agony we watched her in the long line
until she was swallowed up by the box cars.” We were screaming; “Pigs! Dogs! You
dirty Nazi pigs! Come back, Mutti!”

This was the scene Friedel recalled in her sleep time after time. It caused me
great distress and never failed to unnerve me when I heard about it. I shook her by
the shoulders violently until she stopped screaming and awakened. She stared at me
with fear in her eyes, then remembering, sobbed on my breast in huge, loud gasps, as
if fighting for air. I wept on her hair and stroked her hot, perspiring face.

14

 

 

“It’s hard to forget, Jimmie,” she said. “I try to, but it keeps coming back.” '

Her sobbing stilled, and nerves _calmed with a cigarette, I showed her the ice
cream, now a pool of streaky chocolate. It was the first ice cream she ate in years—
or drank, rather. It helped her to forget her experience a little.

STOMPIN G WITH STRAUSS

The PX downtown had opened. I bought powder, rouge, lipsticks, perfumes,
bracelets, and cheap necklaces for Friedel. -I wanted her to have as normal an existence
as possible. The facial make-up did wonders for her physically and inwardly. She didn't
go for gaudy trinkets but she accepted them in good taste.

Physically on the mend, the next phase was the adoption of cultural activity.
She loved opera music and always sang Austrian and German classics. Though Regina
learned to play the harmonica, Friedel’s piano lessons were interrupted by the Nazis
in 1938. We went to a German teacher who put Friedel on a ritual of two lessons
weekly. This was a pleasant absorption. Like a little schoolgirl exhibiting her report
card, she told me of her improvement and the praise given by her teacher.

We went to dances at the various Weinstubes‘ where three-piece German
orchestras loused up American swing and Strauss. But to Friedel it was wonderful.
She learned to sing, “Don’t Fence Me In” in such a German accent that if Roy Rogers
‘heard her he would have hung himself from the nearest cottonwood.

. “Sentimental Journey” was just invading Germany and in no time at all was a
hit. When a Jerry violin grabbed hold of its haunting passages, something had to give.
They “sent” many a GI—out of the Weinstube, But this musical corn was the most
beautiful caterwauling ever. I was with Friedel. That's all that mattered.

The Weinstubes served Apfelsaft (sweet apple juice). Later on the Red Cross
served cokes. Friedel liked everything. She was a congenial companion. As her moods
faded she became fairly effervescent.

One of the GI interpreters bought a score of yards of blue and rose cloth from
a textile manufacturer. He sold me half of it. Friedel and I took it to the Schneiderin
who took measurements and within a week made a couple of sets of undies and dresses.
Friedel looked like a doll and was so proud of her first new clothing since Czestochowa.
We bought new shoes at the Schumacher’s near the PX for a few cigs. The Schneiderin
got her hosiery from somewhere, and also made her a Fall coat.

SPITZ PUPS IN A BEARISH MARKET

From the seamstress I learned where a dog-fancier sold Spitz puppies. During a
stroll one evening, Friedel had seen a bundle of fluffy white scampering down the
street and she ran after it shrieking with delight. I was on the lookout for a Spitz.

Herr Baichle, for a do1lar’s worth of Old Nicks, would have given away his soul.
ln ecstatic joy, Friedel picked up a mewling critter of five weeks from the litter.
She hurried home with Lumpi (Rags) and scoured it in a basin of warm water. She
picked out the nits with a comb, one-by-one, while I kept score. Lumpi had a quota
of about one hundred. During the operation Friedel kept whispering sweet, sympathetic
endearments and laughing as it wriggled out of the basin and falling on its snoot.

A bar of Lux, a panful of suds», a pink ribbon, and Lumpi was ready for his
debut. With its damp hair sticking out like a white porcupine, and eyes blinking in
the sunlight, Lumpi made it to “F” Company. He—or she, was bowlegged but
courageous. It dribbled sort of sideways using its rear for a rudder. Friedel fairly
shrieked. It stopped at every blade of grass, at every miniature telephone polee. I
picked it up once and dropped it. Friedel scolded me. I accused her of loving the
puppy more than she did me.

All the doughs wanted a Spitz. They’d give anything for one. I saw a good thing
and became Friedel’s business agent. “One hundred marks on the barrel-head” I
announced. Soon there were eleven puffs of white rear-ruddering around the com-
pany with GIs chasing them all over the place. Friedel bought the Spitzies at Baichle’s
as fast as they dropped off the assembly line and delivered them C.O.D.

About this time, Katie, a German girl from Turkheim, met Friedel. She had
a voice on the sexy side of laryngitis and was in love with a GI serving time in the
stockade. There was no place for her to go so Friedel took her in. I was not in love
with the German people and considered them all guilty for the war. I was against
aiding Katie.

“If I can forgive some of the Germans,” Friedel said, “so can you. Besides-
Katie is going to have a baby.” That whipped me. Katie stayed on and Friedel divvied
her rations with her.

15

One night Friedel and I attended a children's concert sponsored by her piano
teacher. Being the only GI there the kids paid more attention ogling at me than to
the music. They seemed very amused at my discomfiture.

THE FAIVIILY REUNION

Though Friedel and I were both extremely happy, a pall hung over us.. We
didn’t conceive of how this would end and we were getting deeper and deeper. ._Life
without Friedel was out. That was for sure. I had long ago sent a “Dear John”
letter home. I sent another letter to Justice Frankfurter of the Supreme Court asking
how I might get Friedel to the States.

On August 31st Max arrived.

The British soldier who carried Friedel’s message to England contacted Martha
through the Red Cross. Max, in the British Zone, was immediately reached. He
obtained a furlough, borrowed a car, -and made the long trip to Bavaria. Enroute, he
stopped off at Dusseldorf, saw his old home a heap of rubble, went to the Burgomeister’s
and discovered his aunt's family still alive. Regina had done the same thing. Bernard,
inmate of Buchenwald, half—starved and suffering from tuberculosis, had been wander-‘»
ing around Germany searching for hisfamily. He showed up in Dusseldorf at the
same time. There was great rejoicing, and great sadness. Regina related the story of
their mother. Nobody knew the whereabouts of Hans and his family.

Max spoke excellent English after five years in the English Army. Stationecl
about 40 kilometers from Denmark in the seaport of Eckenforde, he was just about the
whole Military Government in charge of DPs and the German police force. Friedel
had already informed him of our relationship and our future plans. He was non»-
committal. Max was a soldier. He might have thought it was a summer romance,
The multiple heartbreak in his family gave him a certain degree of stoicism. Had our
positions been reversed I might have reacted similarly. +

The next day Friedel rode away. We planned to meet-—after I became free—¢-
in England where she would be with her sister. Three weeks is an awful long time to
be beserk. For almost four months I had a deep responsibility_ All of a sudden I was
shut off like a drunk in a pub. I was on a “Lost Weekend” seven~days a week. 1

The outfit was alerted. Men had been leaving for Marseille regularly. Kirchv
heim seemed deserted. Time did not mitigate my distress but only seemed to act
like water poured on a gasoline fire. v

On Saturday, September 22nd, Friedel returned. Whenever I look back on the
happiest moment of my life—something unbelievable and almost out of this world-_
I think of that afternoon Friedel laid her hand on my shoulder in the parlor of Frau
Schleehan, the photographer’s wife, sobbing and kissing me. I could not entirely gras
the significance of what she had done to return. She hitchhiked from the Danish. bord
to Southern Germany—a distance of 800 kilometers. For five days and nights sh_e
hooked rides on trucks, wagons, trains, freight cars. A suitcase of expensive clothes
was stolen one day but she kept on going. The last night she slept in a coal pile behind
a train’s locomotive, and the night before that, on a gasoline tank. T0 acknowledge her
feat one would have to understand the transportation situation in post-war Germany,
the rampant vandalism, and the danger to a lone girl traveling at night. I was com-
pletely overwhelmed. ‘

In Eckenforde Friedel was feted and had the whole town at her disposal. Gay
parties, dancing, companionship of her two brothers, a piano to herself, twelve Jewf
ish women who showered affection on her, a sailboat, and a beautiful house over:
looking the bay. Friedel became ill and a British doctor informed Max that her
remedy was in Kirchheim. If Max wanted her well again he would have to pack her
bags and put her on a train.

CLERKING IN MARSEILLE

We were together one week then our outfit pulled out for Marseille. I arranged
transportation for Friedel back to her aunt's in Dusseldorf, and bought her another
puppy which she dubbed “Jimmie.”

_ Emigrating to England at this juncture was not so simple as we had thought.
Friedel would have to wait. So the day we pulled into Marseille I made plans to return
to Germany. I could not go home.

My high school commercial course finally came in handy. I became a company
clerk. The CO, plagued by recurrent vacancies of high-pointers pledged to aid my

16

 

return to Germany if I got him out of a hole. I committed many errors but the CO
was a good Joe throughout. For the next hundred days I sent Friedel 110 letters to keep
up her spirit. '

REUNION IN DUSSELDORF

At last, before dawn of January 10th, I was on my way to the airfield at Istres.
The day before, our CO was re-assigned and he wanted to fulfill his pledge. A colonel
bumped me off a plane bound for Munich. Nothing else was scheduled to leave. I
stood, desolately, in the middle of the field cursing all the Brass in Christendom, and
facing a boat-ride home. Everybody was crazy to get back to the States and meeting
all kinds of red tape; I was crazy to get back to Germany and meeting ditto.

An officer in the Engineers piled me into a jeep, drove me across the field and
into a bomber bound for Schweinfurt. I could have kissed his feet. I blessed all the
Second Johns in Christendom.

Five hours later we flew over “Death Valley” and I was soon kissing the mud
of Deutschland just like a Columbus at San. Salvador. Dancing mental capers I hopped
on a train South to Wurzburg then north to Aschaffenburg where we fought during the
war. A GI took me to Frankfurt on a crazy ride late at night. In Wiesbaden I was
stymied. The next day I took the meandering Rhine River road and was stuck for
two hours in Lorch at the French zonal border_ A jeep finally picked me up and
drove me all the way to Bonn deep in the British Zone. Hopping back and forth on
ferries, circling detours and busted bridges, I finally skittered across the Patton
bridge at Cologne, and got the last train for Dusseldorf.

I got everybody up at 3 A. M. Bleary—eyed and unbelieving. Friedel, Regina and
the Goss family, were speechless. Friedel said I was the best nightmare she ever had.

VI

FRANKFUR'l‘—ON-THE-MAIN

HIAS ON THE BALL

I landed a job in Frankfurt with the 3118th Signal Service Group. Friedel got
two rooms near my work. The PX in Marbach Kaserne was well stocked. I got her a
GI radio, leather handbags, silk kerchiefs, fountain pens, and everything that she
desired.

_ We took many trips to Zeilsheim where we visited her friends in the DP camp
there. I ate. with them their simple fare. Many talked of America but most wanted
to emigrate to Palestine. They gave me letters to send to relatives all over the world
—Canada, South America, Australia, Palestine, South Africa, and even in India. Many
were the tearful answers of gratitude I received from these people who learned that
loved ones were still alive in Germany.

Friede1’s home became the half—way point between Denmark and Austria for
Jews still searching for relatives. She fed them, gave them shelter, and a bed over-
night, and then sent them on their way the next morning with a bundle of food
and cigarettes. The German children on the block always got candy and “cow-gummi”
(chewing gum) from her.

On March 13th. I became a civilian. Another Spring in Germany had arrived.
Friedel was proud of my gabardine greens. We took walks, went to the German Kino
in the evenings, or made visits to the zoo. About three nights weekly I went to the
Gllbakery just before closing time and bought Friedel all kinds of scrumptious pastries.

Regina came down from Eckenforde with a telegram Max had received from
the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society of New York City. It directed
Friedel to consult with Mr. Ilya Dijour of the Frankfurt Office regarding the matter
of a visa to the United States. I was almost floored. I went down to the Farben
buildingafter work. Mr. Dijour welcomed me like a Prodigal Son. A kindly old
gentleman, he was all smiles, as he unfolded the whole story

The letter I sent to Justice Frankfurter seven months ago in Kirchheim was
sent to HIAS and the Jewish Telegraph Agency. They had been searching for Friedel
and me forseven months in France and Germany .

“Here,” Mr. Dijour said, handing me a dossier, ‘‘look at this.” It was a yellow shea
of cablegrams and letters. “It’s all about your case.” HIAS contacted Max from a
letter I sent them from Marseille.

“Well, everything is all set,” smiled Mr. Dijour. “Friedel will be issued a corporate
affidavit by HIAS and will be the first post-war Jewish immigrant on the first post-war
ship to the United States leaving on May 1st. We searched high and low for you and
now that we have found you it is a feather in our cap. The New York office will cer-
tainly be happy to learn of this. I have instructed Miss Rosenthal to have her passport
photos ready. forms filled out which I gave her this morning, and to have everything
in readiness.” V

“I didn't write Mr. Frankfurter that I loved Friedel, you know. I am in love
with her,” I said. I

“I have eyes to see with,” Dijour answered. “Anyone who has taken care of her
like you've done must certainly have been in love with her. When she has everything
filled out, let me know.”

Though the Consulate was not yet officially open, Friedel was interviewed by
an aide and her papers accepted. The Counter-Intelligence Corps screened her, and
then she had two sets of passport photos made. However, during the following weeks
she was informed that inasmuch as she had no relatives in the States she would have
to await new regulations.

VVHAT PRICE VICTORY?

The political situation in Germany was in a state of flux. I became alarmed
at the U.S. Military Government's coddling and bottle-feeding of notorious Nazis.
Military Governors in the three Laender of our zone hand—picked minister-presidents
formerly tied to the Hitlerite war—machine.

In the City of Frankfurt alone forty-three per cent of all attorneys and ninety
per cent of the judges were members of the Nazi Party. The Frankfurt Burgomeister,
Dr. Kurt Blaum. was a Major on Hitler’s VVar Production Board who wrote genocide-
inspiring articles during the war regarding depopulation of Alsace-Lorraine and Western

iPoland. The Minister-President of Hesse, Dr. Karl Geiler, was the corporation lawyer

with Standard Oil, sabotaged
One hundred per cent

for I. G. Farben, the industrial octupus, which together
our synthetic rubber production in the war’s darkest days.
of all official state attorneys were Nazis.

SS camps throughout the zone were run along lines of military decorum with
subordinates saluting superiors. The prisoners obtained twice as ‘many rations as the
civilian popula.tion. In the SS camp near Nuremberg, the 1945 Christmas was
celebrated with the adornment of a swastika instead of a Christmas tree. The officers

held pow—wows in their private quarters in preparation for the future when the “easy- 

going Americans” would let them free.

MG purged police administrations of anti-fascists, replacing them with SS men
and Nazi leaders. Many former fighters against Hitler were framed on trumped-up
charges and returned to prison. I knew of a fighter against Franco being held in jail
for over six months and tortured in the nearby town of Hoechst, the setting, ironically,
of Anna Seghers, famous book on Nazi torture, “The Seventh Cross.”

A necessary land reform was not carried out, and thus the Junkers, militarists,
and clerics, were allowed retention of their reactionary base without which new
wars could not start. Whole strata of Nazis, offenders, and followers, were freed
of their crimes by MG decree. 

Twenty—five per cent of the church officials in Land Wurttemberg were Class
I Nazis or followers. In Bavaria it was even higher. Schools and universities were
honeycombed with National Socialists. Clerical fascism raised its ugly head and the
Church sought to split the occupying powers, West against East.

German police were allowed the greatest liberties. They raided Jewish DP
camps and murdered inmates. American CIC agents and Military Police sold black-
market cigarettes to the Jews by day and raided them by night. I saw American
tanks, armed jeeps, and machine-guns trained on helpless Jews in Zeilsheim, giving
our soldiers a good training in anti-Semitism, while German civilians cheered them on.

It was no wonder that German reactionaries claimed that the initials, U.S.A.,
stood for “Unsere Seiligen Adolf” (Our Sacred Hitler). The slogan “Acht und Acht”
(Eight and Eight) deriving from the letter “H”, eighth letter of the alphabet and a
contraction for “Heil Hitler!” was sweeping the colleges.

The former meekness of the populace stiffened, and turned to arrogance. Anti-
Semites sold their tainted wares without molestation, and blood-stained war criminals
nestled in safety under the protective wings of OMGUS. There was, in fact, a higher
percentage of top Nazis in the U.S. Military Government than in German industry.

_ A tenant in Friedel’s home struck her and I could get no redress from the German
pollce. The landlady, also, illegally rented Friedel’s second room occupied by a Latvian

18

u_.

 

 

 

 

Jewish girl who composed children's songs_ When I retrieved the room she vowed ven-
geance on Friedel. She said, “I’m not going to rent my room to dirty Jews while Germans
are homeless.” Her arrogance stemmed from the fact that she was employed by MG
as a language instructor for top brass and the CIC. She terrorized Friedel so much
that _finally she was forced to move. I reported Fraulein Koch to the Spruchkammer
(de-Nazification court) but they failed to act.

I SLUG IT OUT AGAINST FASCISM

My fall from grace with the Military Government began during this period. I
was elected Chairman of the Frankfurt Chapter of the American Veterans Committee.
In our chapter we discussed Potsdam, various phases of the occupation, the Nurem-
berg Trials, and the revival of Nazism.

For several months I sent voluminous dispatches to the papers at home, and
to the AVC Bulletin, the Paris Edition of the New York Herald Tribune, and to
MG’s weekly. “The Occupation Chronicle.”

General Draper of Dillion, Read, and his banker—cartelists, who were tied to
the Nazi trusts before the war, penetrated further into the German economy with the
objective of complete dominance.

My pieces exposed and protested, in the name of peace, democracy, and human-
itarianism. A few of them follow herewith:

“The editorial in The Occupation Chronicle of the 28th entitled, “War Is In-
evitable. IF—” was a masterpiece of its kind. The organizing chapter of the Frank-
furt American Veterans Committee takes this opportunity to endorse the sentiment
contained therein.

“It is not twelve months since the last GI of World War II was buried. Yet we
are faced with Stygian, swirling under-currents of hatred in the United States. It
threatens to devour—not a future generation of soldiersv——but the same millions
who laid away their uniforms only a few months ago. This threat is so real, so per-
nicious, that peace-lovers cannot remain silent or “neutral.” They must raise their
voices and drown out other voices of “paltry prejudices” and those who “dare to
consider war; West against East; power pitted against power; ally attacking ally.”

“As The Chronicle points out, the press is not blameless in fanning the Yug-
oslav incident far beyond its proportions. We remember when not so long ago
Stuka dive—bombers, sinking millions of dollars worth of U.S. supplies and killing
U.S. seamen, had convenient bases in “little Finland.” But one didn't hear the dan-
gerous talk against “poor little Finland”—the ally of Hitler——that we hear today
against our Yugoslavian ally which destroyed vast armies of both Mussolini and
Hitler thereby saving many thousands of American lives. It seems that some sources
of information take a sadistic view of war and delight in stirring its bloody brew.
It will take only the concerted efforts of sincere peace-lovers to point out that in
modern war no side wins——that all victories are Pyrrhic.

“The latest horrific pronunciamento from responsible sources in the United
States announces that the best way to avert atomic warfare is to make “better
atom bombs’’' and “superior ways of delivering them to the target.” Surely, this is
another way of saying that black is white. It gives us veterans and soldiers a fore-
boding of the future. What does the world of nations think of such a statement
emanating from the grand America that was the great “arsenal of democracy” dur-
ing the war, and which performed so heroically in helping destory the Hitlerites?

“We dare not allow the mantle of peace fall from our shoulders. The world
looks to America and its allies for succour and rehabilitation. The danger is not
from without but from within America.

“Let not the blame of war fall upon America. Posterity shall not point a guilty
finger at us and charge us with carrying atom bomb chips on our shoulder. We have
no stake in war. The stake of every American is in a peace unsullied by Martian
appeals. The instability and chaos following in the wake of war is to everyone obvious.
It uproots and retards the progress of mankind. Our hope lies in democratic re-
construction and in faith of the United Nations matched by a sincere striving for
international amity.

And another:

“Germans were startled at the boldness of the banned pastoral letter cast-
igating AMG and the threat of the Vatican spokesman who said, “The suppression of
a pastoral letter is always a bad thing and can have serious consequences."

“The letter was banned because of its untruths and its appeal to prejudices.
It charged that millions of German soldiers are still in prison camps under “miserable

19

conditions” and “put like slaves to forced labor.”If the bishops of Western Germany
who collaborated on this letter would visit Zeilsheim, near Frankfurt, for instance,
they would see how these slaves look on 3000 calories a day and playing soccer and
thumbing their noses through the barbed wire at the Jewish DPs who live on UNRRA
fare of soup and potatoes.

“The letter denounces the forced migration of Germans” back to Germany.
Eight years ago these same Germans heiled Hitler to hell in Danzig, Gdynia, Alsace
and in the Sudetenland. The former victims in these borderlands want now to secure
themselves against further fifth-columning. Where was Archbishop Frings of Cologne
or Bishop Albert Stohr of Mainz in 1938, when Hitler was bent on his “Drang nach
Osten”? These Germans can now live within ethnographic and geographic boundaries
and cry all they want about pretended wrongs.

“Continuing, the bishops write: “ . . . these poor fellows" (German PWs) are
without news from home or allowed to “send a sign of life to their dear ones.” One
hundred thousand remaining Jews from a total of 6,000,000 have no homes to go
to, but I must admit that they know where dear ones are——in the burnt gray ashes that
made sugar beets grow so big around the gas ovens at Treblinka, Lublin, and Auschwitz.
Were these bishops, like Goering and Kaltenbrunner, unaware of the pogroms and
synagogue burnings? Did they cry out then against the “disregard of humaneness”
or “feel morally obligated”?

“The ultimate in naivete was the reference to the “German people’s sense of
justice” being “sorely touched” by the dismissal of Nazis from posts in the govern-
ment. “What sense of justice?” whisper 30,000,000 dead civilians and soldiers of
Allied nations and the anti-fascist Catholics. De-Nazification is proceeding slowly
enough as it is. These bishops, hiding behind their surplices are calling for a con-
tinuation of brutalitarianism.

“Land reform is castigated in the German East as “radical expropriation of
landed property.” But the Church is maneuvering to protect its own vast fiefs as well
as proposing the retention of huge feudalistic holdings in the hands of the Junkers
and militarists.

“The whole attack was aimed at splitting the occupying powers and the dem-
ocratic movement in the western zones ,a week before the Kreistag elections. The
clerical fascists will never give up their Rasputin—like cawings just as theywill never

_ give up in Spain and Greece until world democratic opinion prevails.”

I wrote other pieces protesting the treatment of Jews in Germany, and the
imprisonment of German democrats on trumped-up charges. ‘?

The pre-war alliance of U.S. cartelists with Hit.1er’s growing war machine
began to assume its logical post—war relationship. Dismantling of war plants slowed
down to a walk. Little Nazi satrapies were growing up everywhere. Wall Street
officialdom followed in the wake of our victory like the offal swirling astern a gar-
bage scow_ This American foe of GIs is also the foe of the common German worker
who is the bulwark of democracy in his country. He is our ally, and he is fighting
this new danger. Its impact upon him and his family is very painful. The United
States officials cannot and will not export democracy to Germany. It will rise from
within Germany, not because of our Military Government, but in spite of it. MG is
not the cure; it is the disease.

Friedel wasn’t interested in politics, so it was never discussed. My pieces I wrote
in the Personnel Office where typewriters were at my disposal. Friedel sat down
to wait until we could be free to marry. Otherwise, she was very happy for the ten
months we were together. She bloomed into a majestic personality completely re-
covered from her ordeals, but retaining about her a sad beauty.

BETRAYAL AT NUREMBERG

On October 1st the Nuremberg verdicts were announced. Light sentences and
three acquittals sent a cry of anger through the world. GIs blew their top. German
workers marched out of mill and factory bristling with frustration. I sent the follow-
%ng1 blalslt to The Occupation Chronicle then took off for Schleswig-Holstein on my
ur oug :

“The Nuremberg trials are over but the repercussions are widespread.”

“The unprecendented tribunal culled existing laws ofeighteen nations to draw
up an international charter the basis of which formed the guide to justice. Since it
would serve in further similar judgements if. the case arose, the charter was most
important as a deterrent to the aims of contemplaters of aggressive war. If the pun-

ishments meted out were heavy, war-makers and profiteers would be proportionately
discouraged in planting new seeds of war; if light, the opposite would be enhanced.

“The acquittal of three defendants startled everyone including the U.S. prosecutor.
Robert H. Jackson, and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The imprisonment of seven others
for periods ranging from ten years to life for various counts in the indictments
was no less perturbing. If we emerge from the clouds of tortuous legalism prevalent
at Nuremberg out into the sunlight of fact and recognize that the ten defendants
were part and parcel of" the Nazi regime which snuffed out at least 30,000,000 lives,
one wonders what was the measurement used by which they were allowed to live and
others to hang. Somehow, though the clipped British voice of Justice Geoffery Law-
rence over the radio did sound “very impassive” and “very juridical” the, figures,
the sentences do not seem to jibe. Twelve over 30,000,000 seems like such a modest
ratio.

“It makes one feel quite disagreeable to know that thousands of American
boys lying under German soil shall never sip another soda at the corner drugstore
while three men can now walk over that soil, free. Thinking seriously it doesn't seem
that any of the ten could be worth one Colin Kelly, or a Joe Magneziewski, or a
Major Glenn Miller. We knew a teen-age kid once who got fined five dollars for
ringing in a false alarm but three men who professed allegiance to Adolph Hitler
were not fined one pfennig.

“For six years grimy and sweating Allied soldiers swallowed mud and swam
crimson floods to bring this quarry to bay. Would it have been better to have exacted
judgment on the spot rather than turn them over to white-collared, black-robed
senility who double-talk and gargle and harrumph through writhing circumlocutions?
Somehow fancy words of law can be pretty intriguing and all dressed-up while seeming
to violate its spirit. Anyway, nobody seems to be satisfied or know how to bring
30,000,000 people back to life.

“Like a whirling montage we see a pair of baby shoes standing out on a pile
of footgear at Maidenek; a resplendent German goose-stepping down Chamberlain-
strasse; a GI in a trench at Otterbach sobbing over the shrapneled form of Joe the
Polish boy from Chicago; 100,000 throats screaming, “Heil!” Lt. Markoochi’s blackened
face at the Moder River as the Schu-mine went off and saying calmly, “I lost my girl
friend. Now I've lost my leg.’’

“Who is guiltier? One whose hands are covered with blood, like Streicher, or
one, like von Neurath receiving 15 years though his hands are covered with ink
from signing execution orders? Yet Streicher got death.

“Who is guiltier? Sauckel who enslaved 15 million foreign workers. or Fritzche
the Goebbelsian echo who cooked up imaginary outrages perpetrated by Czechs and fed
them to the Germans?

“Who is guiltier? Kaltenbrunner who dealt more on an individual basis with
Jews in Austria and drew death, or Hjalmar Schacht who bought out nations on
an individual basis and was acquitted? ,

“Was von Papen, the lethal mouthpiece of the Junkers, acquitted because he
smiled once at a Jew perhaps? Did Funk, the banker take less than his share of
gold teeth and thus save himself from the gallows? Did von Schirach, the (Oh-so-
handsome) Pied Piper of German youth draw only 20 years because he didn't destroy
life with his own hands, maybe, but showed German boys how to pitch-fork Allied
pilots?

“It makes one dizzy just squirming through the legal maze to try and fathom how
such verdicts could be unabashedly announced to a ' weary world. The mountain
labored ten long months and brought forth a mouse. Our soldiers fight like fury but
our justice hits with the lightness of a feather.

“A Lichfield GI strikes you-know-who and receives 20 years—-the same sentence

.drawn by Speer, the “courageous” Nazi munitions-maker. A -GI deserter gets death,

but Raeder, who sank the Athenia gets life. A GI steals a watch from a German and
gets 10 years; Karl Doenitz who sank neutral ships and seamen gets no more .The
figures, the words, seem all mixed up.

“Are we prejudiced because we are not satisfied with the verdict? Because this
nucleus of Machiavellian sadists sneering in the dock did not get the maximum pen-
alty? Remember, they were not called to account because they were suspect. They
were in fact convicted by the tried moral patience of two billion people. The procedure
of the IMT was really only a concession of democracy—a routine matter to discuss
and then file away the crimes and penalties in alphabetical dossiers. Who is there

that denies that he would have been more impressed if the justice were swift, that
the final sorry outcome of the ten-month trial were ours to do over again?

“They were individually and collectively the dynamo and powerhouse of the
Nazi Party, the apostles and instruments of its policies, the blood and veins coursing
through the whole structure of the predatory Reich. No plan of torture, no Neander-
thal act could have been committed without the approval of these high priests. One
ripened the way for the Nazi harvest with inked documents while the other followed
with the sword. They were the centrifugal center, the suns about which the German
orbit careened and had its being. How farcically moribund to split hairs concerning the
degree of guilt! '

“Politics pared the verdict at Nuremberg. To think otherwise is to believe the
world is flat. Of von Papen it can be said that in two world wars he never burned
his bridges behind him. The master spy in the Black Tom explosion made friends in
other nations with high-collared diplomacy who aided him in putting Hitler on his
pedestal for ulterior motives, and thus were not abashed at his “political morality.”

“Schacht, no goose-stepper in polished boots, worked with striped trousers in
the councils of high finance. He met annually during the war at Basle, Switzerland,
with representatives of the Chase National Bank and the Bank of England. Schacht,
divided up the world over a polished table in Basle with U. S_ and British bankers
while humanity died in Flanders Field. But those friends came to his rescue finally,
even though Chase National was indicted by the FBI for trading with the enemy.

“The verdict sabotaged at one fell swoop the denazification of Germany. Den-
azification boards, already stocked with camouflaged Nazis, will toy with their work
after this green light. The war criminals on trial in Tokyo and the Krupps in Ger-
many were unreservedly enheartened. Fascist criminals pending trial all over the
world have now great glimmers of hope. How can we expect the small-fry to bake
when the big fish are swimming about? The faltering, hesitant trend toward world
denazification was arrested still further and is in danger of collapse.

“On October 1, 1946 the ghost of Mein Kampf flew over the Palace of Justice
There was a trial but the demands of justice were only secondary. It did not alleviate
the pangs of twelve anguished years. The most wilful and decadent sections of
world reaction, walking hand-in-hand, had their innings at Nuremberg. Now the
common people await their turn at bat.” *

Alongside my piece was the following
editorial comment:

“In his letter Mr. Bilotta has joined
the Nuremberg flood of journalistic rhetoric
well. The spirit in which he has Written strikes
one deeply. He weighs the decisions with the
crime committed against humanity, in quite
a human fashion, and finds the balance over-
whelming in favor of the latter——‘12 over
30,000,000.’

Upon my return from Eckenforde I
received many congrats—and a one-way ticket
to the states. They gave me about twenty-
four hours to vamoose. Friedel was in a state
of shock. Her friends visited me as though at
a wake. AVC kept calling up to find out what
the hell was going on.

Friedel visited HIAS but Mr. Dijour
was ill in Paris. The Consulate lost her papers;
the CIC barely remembered her. She could
not get a visa until I was free. Bernard
brought her back to Eckenforde where I visit-
ed her for two days from Bremerhaven. On
November 8th my ship sailed.

I came to Germany to fight Fascism. I
was ousted from Germany by MG for the
same reason. I, probably, was the very first
victim of the yet-unwritten ‘loyalty’ purges.
Because I took the name of Chase National
in vain it was a mortal sin. Nobody must have the effrontery to point a finger at the
bankers and the cause of wars—least of all those who risk life and limb on the
battlefield. I could not remain silent and yet remain guiltless. A

VII
BACK IN THE OLD WORLD

A PRETTY KETTLE OF FISH

Ten days later I stepped off the gangplank into a land torn with reaction. The
Melting Pot reeked of fish—red herring. And along with that was the smell of Fascism,
two ‘inseparable peas in the same pod.

Red—baiters——the grave-diggers of democracy—were on the loose. Ku-kluxers,
and anti-Semites emerged from under damp rocks. Liberal radio commentators got
the heave-ho, or were not liberal any longer. FDR’s illustrious name was getting a
slight tarnish from his classic enemies. Some liberals—pho~ny and feeble alike—and
pathetic intellectuals, were crawling under their beds on all’ fours rather than put
up their dukes. Political opportunists joining the wolf pack, were serving in their
traditional role of door—man to big business and door-mat to reaction.‘ Misleaders
of Labor genuflected before the New Deal bier and guiltily turned FDR's picture towards
the wall.

Civil rights went by the board, the Constitution was being lynched. Law-
makers were the biggest lawbreakers. The “bi-partsian” get-tough bullies were com-
mitting “bi-partisan” rape on the Lady of Bedloe Island.

It was a European newsreel turned backward.

I did not visit home until legal proceedings began the following May. I took a
job in the Wood Textile Mill in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

Meanwhile, Max was demobilized in Germany and returned to England. Regina's
visa came through and she went to sister Martha's in Middlewich-Cheshire. Alone
again, Friedel returned to Frankfurt where she’d be near HIAS and the Consulate. I
sent her food and clothing regularly and we put ourselves on a ritual of five letters
weekly which was to last at least two years. Worry and remorse had reacted upon
her negatively. Her cheerful letters were stab wounds in the heart because I knew
she was putting up a front. It was painful to look at a map of Germany. Turkheim,
Kirchheim, and Frankfurt turned on a spigot of tears. It was a rough session. We
needed each other like a cripple needs crutches. Patience was a bitter ally, but so
necessary today for our “singing tomorrows."

In September legal proceedings were successfully resolved and Friedel brought
all necessary papers under the GI-Fiance Law to HIAS and the Consulate. On Nov-
ember 21st I received the following report from HIAS via the New York office:

“Friedel Rosenthal was processed yesterday as a Fiancee by the U.S. Consulate.
In all probability she will sail in December, 1947 to arrive in New York after December
15, 1947. This is being done so that the grace period of 90 days allowed a fiancee does
not expire prior to March'15, 1948 when Mr. Bilotta will become eligible to marry.”

Doing handsprings I paid for Friedel’s plane fare to save her distress at sea. I
perambulated up and down Essex Street window-shopping and taking eager notice of
the clothing I would buy her.

‘It was puzzling what followed. She had received a British visa which expired
on November 28th. Then she was informed by the U.S. Consulate that she must wait
until March.

Max returned to Frankfurt and got a job at HIAS. It took a big load off my mind.
His sister had been ill off and on mostly from nervousness.

In March Friedel brought my final papers to HIAS the consul, and the CIC.
Then began the foul and obscene drama that drove my fiancee to a complete nervous
collapse.

VIII
THE IN QUISITION

THE MERRY-G0-ROUND BEGINS

In 1946 and 1947 Friedel had visited the CIC and Consulate a dozen times. They
assured her that upon presentation of my divorce papers she would receive clearance.
Upon receiving my first papers she applied for an Exit-Permit in November 1947. MG
in Wiesbaden asked her for a Befreiungschein, the certificate of “purity” from the
denazification court. To a Jew this was the supreme insult. Friedel justifiably voiced
protest reminding them of her DP status. However, she went to the Spruchkammer
and was duly cleared of Nazi taint. Then acknowledging her application MG said they
must first receive her visa from the Fiancee Consul. The latter, in turn, stated that
upon clearance from the CIC he would issue her a visa.

ENTER A BLOCKLEITER‘

She made a visit to the CIC and spoke to a Mr. Farr. He said her papers were
all in order, stamped, and approved, and sent to the consul’s, but that they were re-
turned for further investigation. He had nothing more to do with her case. Mr.
Farr’s further disinterest in the matter did not prevent him from interrogating her. An
informal transcript of the questioning‘ follows:

Is your fiancee a Communist?
I do not know his political views. I am not interested in politics.
Why do you Want to marry him?
I love him very much.
But there. are enough men for you here in Frankfurt.
I have my man already. Other men do not interest me in the least.
I will investigate your papers further but it will take time.
Please do what you can. My fiance has paid for the plane fare.
Oh———Communists have a lot of money? They can buy plane tickets?

. If you mean Jimmie he hasn’t much money. He works for daily wages and
in st save every penny he can.
Q. Was he a member of the German Communist Party? (Sic!) Did he work for
them?
A. He worked for the War Department. When he was free we went to the
movies, or to the theatre, or on strolls. Sometimes we visited my friends from
the concentration camps.
Q. Do you know why he was sent home?
A. Before we parted he said MG accused him of writing letters to newspapers
showing radical leanings.
Q. What is your political belief?
A. I was never interested in politics because as a young girl I was sent to the
concentration camps. ' .

_PORTRAIT OF AN AMERICAN GAULEITER

She returned twice to the CIC. They informed her that thepapers were at the
Consulate Building in the possession of WAC Captain Duffy. The latter, in turn, said
the papers were returned to CIC. Friedel trekked back to CIC and was interviewed

G by a Mr. Waltersdorf.

What did your fiance do for work here?

He worked in the Personnel Office of the Signal Corps.

Did he participate in politics, also?

At the end I learned from him that MG did not approve of his political writings.
What do you think about Russia. '

I don’t know anything about Russia. .

But you must have some kind of opinion about Russia.

. I do not know the Russian people. I want to go to America to marry my
Nance. Only America interests me.

Q. What do you think about a war with Russia?
A. I do not think anything about it.

Q. Who do you think will win the next war between Russia and America?
A. I do not know how to answer you. I spent seven years in the war and that
was enough.

Q. Are you afraid to stay in Germany when the war comes?

A. Of course, I am afraid. I want to live in peace. I have had enough terror
and starvation. What has this to do with my papers? What have I done? Why

. are so many difficulties placed in my path?

Q. Don’t be angry with the CIC. We have nothing against you. We know you
are innocent. ‘

A. What has my fiance done, then? Is he a criminal? When a man commits a
crime he_is put in jail. ,

Q. We can’t put your fiance in jail.

A. Then why all this questioning? Why so many difficulties when you say I
am innocent and know that I have nothing to do with politics? My nerves are in
a very bad state. The CIC approves German frauleins for entry to the United
States very qu1ckly, but I, who should have priority, am still in Germany.

Q. It is not the CIC’s fault. It is up to the consul now.

A. When I was liberated I was so very happy to be free. I could have gone to
my sister’s in England. But the visa expired. You people said that my fiance’s
divorce papers were all that were necessary. I have them now and we are both
free to marry.

Q. But there are other men here whom you can marry. ’

A. I love Jimmie and he loves me. We were always happy together. And I
don’t want any other man.

Q. But they are Americans . . . .

A. I am no “Bahnhof Madchen” (Street-walkers near Frankfurt Railroad Station).
I’ll look for no soldiers. I have my Jimmie. It is enough for me.

Q. You can find an American with plenty of stripes—somebody who has been
checked on and doesn’t need to be watched by the CIC.

A. I don’t understand why you ask me these questions. You people are breaking
my heart.

Q. What do you do all day long? ,

A. I have plenty of house work to do.

Q. You should not make your life so difficult. You should go to the movies or
to a ball game and try to forget your troubles.

A. I have no interest in recreation while I am so sad.

Q. I will see what I ca.n do with your papers. Come back in three weeks. I can-
not make the final decision. That is up to the consul.

When Friedel returned on May 5th Waltersdorf said her papers were at the
consul’s and that he had nothing more to do with the case. Up against a stonewall of
bureaucracy and sick at heart, she was sent on a virtual merry-go-round from office
to office a dozen more times. The American officials and their German secretaries
seemed to revel in her helplessness. The German secretary to Fiancee Consul Mamby
repeatedly insulted her and denied the papers were in the office.

“Who am I to believe——you or the CIC?” Friedel asked. She returned with the
CIC secretary who went in to see Mamby. Friedel’s papers were there all the time.

STAR-SPANGLED KREISLEITER .
Her eyes full of frustrated tears, Friedel was interrogated by Mamby before his
German secretary who interposed questions regarding my, and Friedel’s political views.

Mamby: You must understand that your fiance can’t make enough money to
support you.
A. I plan to work. Together we can make enought to live on.
Q. But you can’t speak English.
A. I can sew and do house work. There must be a lot of work in America that
doesn’t require English to be spoken.
Q. You should think it over, nevertheless.
A. I have thought it over many months. I love my man and I belong to him.
Q. Do you know that Bilotta will go to prison some day for his political views?
A. We never spoke about politics. We talked about our future. Do you know what
it is to love someone and have to wait while others hold a. decision to your whole
life?
Q. How was Bilotta to you? '
A. He was my father and mother. He is everything, means everything to me.
Q. You ‘can find work in Germany, you know.
A. Never in Germany will I work. I will never help rebuild this land soaked
with the blood of my people murdered by the Germans ~
Mamby’s secretary: Fraulein Rosenthal, how can you talk like that about the
Germans? You should not think of them so.
Friedel: Probably you would like to have changed places with me for the last
seven years, Fraulein secretary?
Mamby: You could find work in a Jewish organization.
A. How can I work here with a broken heart? My only wish is to be with my
fiance.
Q. It would be well for you to think it over.‘ Your fiance doesn’t earn enough
money.
Mamby finally said that he couldn't make a decision on the case yet. The
papers would have to be returned to the CIC for further investigation. When he
wanted her he'd send her notice through the mail.

25

The brutal immorality, the depraved illiteracy of the questions I shot at my
fiancee by the U.S. officials bear upon them the self-same trademark characteristic
of the gutter Kultur of her German tormentors. Who has committed the greatest
crime against Friedel Rosenthal? At least the whole world knew of the open program of
Mein Kampf. The Ubermensch left nothing to the imagination.

But now comes the American “liberators” hiding behind a facade of Jeffersonian
democracy, behind an army of self-sacrificing GIs. And they pounce on a girl who
yearned and prayed and died a thousand deaths waiting for the freedom that has yet
to come. Motivated by the same lecherous bestiality that built gas chambers by the
same maniacal frenzy that turned Germany into a charnel house, the Mambys and the
Waltersdorfs prod and gloat, poke and goad, kick and pummel, an innocent flower of
Judea

How close are we——how close we all must be to that grim point preceding
the death of nations when the power and might of the greatest state on earth stoops
to pawing and buffeting a guiltless girl writhing in the throes of unrelenting help-
lessness?

Who has committed the greater crime——Germans or Americans?

“All the time,” Friedel wrote, “I was sobbing violently. The sense of frustration,
the feeling that I was being toyed with, some of the obscene questions, and the needling
of Mr. Mamby’s secretary prodding me about my non-existent political views caused me
such distraction that I had to bite my lip until it bled. I begged Mr. Mamby to clear
my papers, that I had suffered so much before and now all I wanted was a little hap-
piness. I’ve had enough sadness for one 1ifetime.”

AFTER THE INQUISITION
Friedel, May, 1948

“ . . . much thinner . . . face etched by lines of a.mn‘ety.”
—Boston Globe

(Compare above photo with frontispiece)

The HIAS director revealed that Mamby feared association with me would cause
Friedel tobe like me—’~a back-handed compliment if I ever heard one. They are trying
to give her a hard time,” Ortner told Max, “to discourage her from joining her fiance.”

After‘ the Mamby grilling Max returned from work and picked Friedel’s prostrate
form off the bedroom floor. He called in a physician who declared that she was in

26

 

a state of utter nervous collapse. For a month she lay in bed. Only two people were
allowed to visit her. She was forbidden to write to me and my mail was halted at the
bedroom door.

Caswell, the consul in charge of general immigration, said that because Friedel
associated with me she was guilty of having my political views; that I wrote my
articles in her home; and that my income was insufficient.

The first reason is totally un—American in concept, and the second is totally
untrue. For the third, other GIs who make no more money than I are accorded due
privileges under the GI-Fiancee Law. The CIC’s encouragement to Friedel to “find”
another American whom she could marry without risking political purity exposes their
malignant spite. In effect, they say she’ll be okayed if she hooks up with another,
but will be kayoed if she sticks by me. In truth, Friedel is being held hostage for my
democratic political views.

Mamby, Caswell, and Waltersdorf have her on the rack. They turn the screws
knowing they’ll go unpunished for their crime. They know that hopped-up reaction,
in the saddle and riding high, has given my fiancee a choice——that of strangling or
drowning.

This designing crew, severed from reaction’s umbilical cord has eagerly given
U.S. visas to Nazis, anti—Semites, and their ideological followers. But thousands of
Jews, yet languishing in German lagers, are refused entry to our country because they
haven't crossed the “t’s” or dotted the “i’s” of our discriminatory immigration laws
and quotas. Jews have entered the United States but only an irreducible minimum.
There are tens of thousands of Polish Jews in the U.S. Zone, yet the annual Polish quota
is 6000 compared to 25,000 for Germans. And, Friedel, a German citizen, is still taboo on
that quota. Every effort is being exerted to bar Jews from this country even to the
extent of cancelling the corporate affidavits once allowed charitable Jewish or-
ganizations

growth o-f private power to a point where it becomes stronger than
their Democratic State. That, in its Essence, is Fascism.”—F.D.R.

BETRAYAL ON THE POTOMAC

THE WAR DEPARTMEN'l‘—-—WAR CRIMINAL HOOKUP

The puny minions in Frankfurt, the ward-heel leiters, take orders from the
State Department which by no means disregards the fact of Friedel’s faith. In fact it
is strike two against her. If she could make an atom bomb that could destroy human
life and leave industrial machinery intact they would send for her in a special plane.
That is why Nazi technologists are given the green light by the War Department to
become U.S. citizens while Friedel is shunted aside_

Hjalmar Schacht, the financial “wizard” who paved Hitler’s. road to power
with gold, is now free. The same CIC that persecutes Friedel once gave Axis Sally
a clean bill of health in Germany. Col. Otto Skorzeny who massacred American GIs,
has been freed by the U.S. Army. He is now assisting SS generals in writing the history
of the war and says he will be admitted to our country. Heinz Guderian, Hitler’s
ace panzer chief, is head of the U.S.-sponsored Abwehr, a terrorist spy outfit working
out of Allendorf in the U.S. Zone. Ilse Koch, the depraved, subnormal wife of the
commandant of Buchenwald, who executed handsome prisoners and made lampshades of
their tattooed skin, will soon be free by order of General Clay. Walter Wendt, SS chief,
who burned two hundred prisoners alive in Buchenwald, will be free in 1950. Is it
any wonder that German democrats quip: “Please, God, give us a Fifth Reich, quick!
The Fourth is as bad as the Third.”

The SS men who massacred surrendered GIs at Malmedy have had death sent-
ences commuted by the War Deartment. High brass has more respect for Nazi War
criminals than for ourlfallen comrades. Other war criminals are being let out of
jail. Friedel is now the prisoner. Barabbas is free and the Madonna is on the rack.

Seven years of Hitlerism and three years of Military Government have
not done well by my fiancee. I sent four dire appeals to Truman but he does not
answer.

Friedel is the victim of a gentleman’s agreement between the State Department
and Military Government in Germany. Our GIs liberated her, but our officer-diplomats

Yes, the shadow of anti-Semitism is lengthening in America. And it is a corner-
stone of our foreign policy. Our land is following the classic pattern of the Third _Re1cl_1.
Spy scares, jingoism, all are portentous and stifling our freedoms. One thing 1S
crystal-clear in my mind: In whatever country you_ see concentration of big_ business,
there you'll find anti-Semitism. The two go hand-in-hand. As the former intensifies
so does the latter. It has been deepening in the two years that I have _been home. The
deterioration of civil liberties in 1948 are much further propelled than in 1946.

ormroused from a sick bed and dragooned at the Polizei-Prasidium (Police Station)
WaSFrankfurt Max concerned for her health. wanted to go along, but the German
prblice wouldn't allow his presence. Friedel, wan and shaky, once again faced the
same German maltreaters of her family.

A German officer interrogated her. He asked her name, nationality, and which
camps she was an occupant of. They were looking for a Friedel Rosenthal, a Polish-Jewish
woman whom, they said, mistreated inmates of the concentration camp of Raven-
sbruck ’and they thought she might be the one. Although, born in Germany, Friedel
took the nationality of her Polish-born parents, which was customary in Europe.
This data was on her DP card. She was in five camps, but never in Ravensbruck.
(About this time ‘an immigration agent came to my place of work in Lawrence with
a cock-and-bull yarn. He was searching for a person with my name who entered the
country illegally from Italy some years ago. He probably had me already ticketed
for Italy. It would be a neat trick—sending me back where I never came from. He
also asked whether I had ever renounced my citizenship_ I .have no doubt that the
two incidents were related.)

My fiancee referred the officer to Heinz Muller, a Jewish refugee, who worked
two years in that same police station but was currently employed at HIAS. Heinz
was interrogated twice in the next two days. The German declared that he was
employed by the CIC and assigned on Friedel’s case regarding her visa. He asked
Heinz all about me and what I did in Germany, and my politics. He questioned him
concerning Friedel’s political views, the political views of her family, and the re-
lationship with her neighbors. Heinz answered all the questions truthfully and upon
signing an affidavit of his testimony, voiced the opinion to the CIC agent that he
didn't know why Friedel was beset with so many difficultes and that if they con-
tinued, she would not live to see me again. He said that Friedel was ignorant of
politics and was interned sincea young girl of fourteen. In addition there were a score
of witnesses available at the Zeilsheim DP camp if they wanted to check on her
activities in the concentration camps.

As a result of this new turn, my fiancee's condition worsened. Max tried to
get her to the sanitarium at Bad Wildungen. The physician made regular visits and
informed Max that she must be operated upon internally but in her extreme nervous
state it would be dangerous. When she became somewhat better Max carried his sis-

ter each day to the porch by the side of the house where she laid on a mattress in the
sunlight.

In the midst of favorable manifestations and Muller’s favorable testimony

‘s, in fact,
r added that I was at “variance with
the occupation policies.” (And to that, on behalf of my deceased buddies, I add, “Amen."l
Redecker wrote that a “review” of her case was being considered.

The “review” of her case was that undertaken by the German CIC agent under

Waltersdorf’s instruction. The Ravensbruck deal could not be pinned on Friedel
but it made no difference.

On July 21st, Mr. Herve J. L’Heureux, chief of the State Department's Visa
Division finally informed Congressman Lane that “Under the law the responsibility for
the issuance or refusal of a visa to Miss Rosenthal rests with the American consular
officer concerned.”

On July 26th, Mamby sent Friedel a letter informing her to call at his office
and present all her documents regarding the issuance of a visa to her. Friedel was
in high spirits once again. Max brought her in his car as she was not yet well. The
German secretary took the letter from Max and gave it to Mamby who confiscated it.
Mamby then informed Friedel that he had made an error in sending the letter and
said that he had received a telegram from the Visa Division forbidding the issuance
of a visa to her!

Through Lane I charged L’Heureux with deliberate deceit and violation of the
GI-Fiancee Law, Friedel repeatedly asked Mamby the reason for rejection and he
could not give her one. Subsequent inquiries from the States met with similar reti-
cence.

“I have broken no law,” Friedel told Mamby. “Why am I not allowed to marry
the man who saved my life and who loves me? My parents were killed by the Germans,
not because they did anything wrong, but because they were Jews. You let Germans
go to America who adored Hitler, and when they tell you they were not in the Nazi
Party, all you ask from them is a piece of paper. I spent many years in the con-
centration camps under Hitler and you give me no reason why my visa application
is rejected. I must suffer for no reason that you can give while my tormentors are
allowed passage to America.

To this day the military authorities, the consular officals, and the Visa Divison,
have not given a single reason for rejection. Nor can they, for there are no reasons.
They remain arbitrary, adamant, and arrogant, defying the law. The only thing
that can alter their treachery is the American people themselves. Those who have con-
spired to send my beloved to an early demise are no less tainted than the abhorrent
stormtroopers who murdered half her family and sent six million Jews to the gas
chambers.

L’Heureux recently declared that Hitler’s Nazi Party did not believe in the over-
throw of governments by force and violence.

This novel interpretation of Mein Kampf came to light in a Washington press
conference held by L’Heureux and his aide, Ugo Carusi, of the Displaced
Persons Commission. The report follows but very few people learned about it be-
cause this important news a kept press kept suppressed:

Reporter: I have a couple of questions about registration (for admission under
the Displaced Persons Program). First, in Germany. Would a former member of the
Nazi Party be admitted to register?

L’Heureux: Under normal immigration laws there is nothing that would exclude
a Nazi or a fascist. .

Reporter: They (Nazis) are not considered to be in violation of the rule against
views regarding the overthrow of this government by force and violence?
Carusi: I don't think so. At least we have never determined that.

Reporter: As far as your statement is concerned that the Nazis did not back the
overthrow of the government by force, what did you mean—just how broad is that?

L’Heureux: I don't think we have ever concluded that the Nazi Party agreed
that it is for the overthrow of government by force.

Reporter: This is sort of astonishing to some of us. We assumed they (the
Nazis) set out to overthrow governments.

L’Heureux: Well, wouldn't we all believe in the overthrow of government. by
force if we were at war with another country? If the Consul ascertains that the
person was only a nominal member of the Party (Nazi), as we have several cases,
who belonged to the youth movement and when they became 18 were enrolled in the
Party and paid party membership but took no other activity, and they were coming
here to marry a G.I., and live in patriotic surroundings, there isn’t any prejudice to
the national interest to let such a person in. It all revolves on our determination as
to whether the entry would be prejudicial to the national interest or a security
threat.

So. We fought a war to let “nominal” Nazis in our country when they couldn't
take it over by force of arms. L’Heureux, who lied to Congressman Lane,_- and blocked
Friedel’s entry, admits he has allowed Nazis in our country. He is not “prejudiced”
against “nominal” Nazis but he is prejudiced against one of their Jewish victims.

29.

 

L’Heureux has Friedel just where the Nazis wanted her. The Ilse Koch mentality
of U.S. officialdom is gaining by leaps and bounds. The law of the knout, threatemng
all, is achieving supremacy-

I am certain that Friedel was cleared by the CIC at the beginning, but their in-
vestigation of my writings caused the papers to be returned. After the latest episode
the CIC police still would not leave her alone. Twice more they visited her home to
interrogate her. Not hunting fascists they must needs turn to hounding. J_eWS. And
sometimes in the night I wake up, suddenly, in a sweat, as during a cannonading by the
Rhine, and I hear Friedel’s plaintive cry: “Oh Jimmie! They’ve plucked at my heart!
Now they reach for my soul! Please help me!”

The CIC’s specialties are black-marketing and hounding the love-lorn. They
must sharpen their claws on a helpless girl lying desperately ill, While pI'1SOI1 gates
swing open for Nazis. Our enemies are our allies; our allies, enemies.

How can we reconcile the exclusion of Friedel from the United States with
the admittance of ex—King Michael, ally of Hitler, Nagy, Mikolajczck and General Bor.
-Has the Green International assumed the status of a sovereign state?
Is our country now the haven of the riff—raff of Europe? Is this the “new look” for
which one million GIs were maimed and killed? Do Friedel’s years of incarceration
under the Third Reich go for nought? Does my combat record and my oppostion to
MG’s alliance with German cartelists destroy my rights under the GI-Fiancee Law?

Thousands of frauleins who have never had one hour’s instruction in democracy
are entering the country with the stamped approval of Waltersdorf and Mamby.
They were, in fact, weaned on hatred for Americans while Friedel admires the
American people and is genuinely grateful to them for sending soldiers to rescue
her from a living death. What kind of screening process do these frauleins undergo?
Are they insulted by Waltersdorf and Mamby; humiliated, or framed? A kindly Jewish
girl is a threat to our country, but the dregs of Old Europe have become the heroes
of the State Department.

IT IS HAPPENING HER-E.

In our country the political sadists reign Only a short while ago they reckoned
the “get tough” policy in dollars; now, they tally the ‘cost in blood. Militarism is
on the sawdust trail. Flag-wavers and breast-thumping profiteers beat the drums
of war and filibuster on the graves of the fallen. Haunted by the fear of an impending
economic crisis, they inject the war virus in the body politic.

We rebuked the German people for s.econding Hitler’s achievement of power.
Let’s not give our land over to those who incite the egg—tossers and tomato-throwers.
Let‘s not be in the same position of the contrite German who once wrote on a wall
in Munich: “Dachau! Belsen! Buchenwaldl I am ashamed to be a German!”
Boston Common must not become the site for a concentration camp.

No matter how entrenched or strong reaction may appear outwardly, “The
earth still moves,” as Galileo informed his papal Inquisitors. And it moves in the
direction of peace, progress, and democracy.

I have been charged with being a Communist. The name doesn’t matter.
Quaking before the Inquisitors only invites further hounding. Those who recant
are lost. We have a rich national tradition in the fight for freedom. Paine, Jeff-
erson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, patriots all. Just as in their time, we are living in an era
fraught with decision. We, too, shall give a good account of ourselves.

I believe in democracy with a fervent, undying love. If I did not I would not
have taken up the cudgels against a Nazi revival and Friedel would have been my
wife today. I ’ ‘

I believe in the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights. So
much so that my very defense of it irks reaction to the extent were
laws beneficial for Nazis are for Friedel and me null and void.

I believe in political, economic, and social freedom for all. I fight Jim Crow
and anti-Semitism with equal fervor.

I believe in freedom of religion and speech. and I actively fight for these freedoms.

_If that's Communism, then I plead guilty———and so do 100,000,000 adult
Americans. This is my answer to the witch-hunters enjoying great sport today in
this open season on non—conformists, but they shall find that the hunt always comes
to an end, and they and their baying hounds squelched.  « ‘

Nobody asked the color of my politics on the line. The wounded and the weeping
had a better, a more noble sense of proportion. Can you fight? That’s all that
mattered. When red blood flowed, red herrings were tossed into the garbage cans

30.

 

 

Nobody stayed my hand and asked questions when I crawled on my navel to aid the
stricken. The only politics they were interested in were the spewings from the
business end of my BAR.

Though they continue to remorselessly beat the brush for an unwitting
partridge, Friedel has done nothing, said nothing, intimated nothing, against the
interests and security of the United States. Not a single charge can be made against
her and stick. She is a hostage for my democratic beliefs, pure and simple. The ransom
they demand is life-long bondage while she wanders all over Europe scrounging for
crumbs off the “bipartisan” table.

It has gone beyond a question of civil rights. Continued tihralldom after seven
years in the lagers means an early demise for my fiancee. She has served a great
penance for being born a Jew. Her Golgotha has lasted ten years. The lynch-minds
of the State Department must not be allowed to cart her off in the tundril of silence
to the guillotine of political hysteria. She has lived in twilight for so long she now
awaits the dawning that will drive away the shadows-. Determined men hold her in
subjection. Only a more determined people can free her. ‘

When I left Friedel in November, 1946, she was healthy and full of hope.
Today, she is distraught and ill. But she has: plenty of pluck. Every time American
friends of Ilse Koch knock her to the canvas she gets up at the nine-count and fights
back. She cannot do this forever; she has more heart than health. She is a living
monument of Jewish courage and has proven her mettle in the forge.

Isn’t there room for this child of adversity in our countr,y——in this “asylum of
mankind?” I am not asking for any favors or political patronage when I appeal on
her behalf to the American people. Political hues must not blunt the fight for Friedel’s
freedom or she will be sacrificed. It is necessary only that a combat man’s country-
men recognize Friedel’s struggle as their own in every sense of the word, and open the
door for her deliverance. I know it can be done. She is under siege. She holds the fort
until a wrathful people rise to wipe out another bar sinister off America's escutcheon.

I spent the last few pennies saved from my combat pay to bring this appeal to the
people. It is not a disgrace to be broke. But we need financial aid.

I do not expect better treatment than that given to other GIs. I don’t even
expect better treatment than that accorded German ex-soldiers coming to this
country and marrying American women with the aid of U.S. Senators who delight in
playing cupid for master race theorists. All I ask is that the country I fought for give
me the opportunity to marry my long-suffering sweetheart, to allow me to nurse her
back to health as I did once before, and give her the happiness she so richly deserves.

LETTER FROM A SICK BED
My dearest beloved:

I sat up.in bed for an hour today. It felt good and besides it gave me an op-
portunity to write to you.

Lying here one cannot help but reminisce. How did I get here in 1948? This is
where I was in 1945, just before I.met you. It seems so very strange. All the time in
between is like a dream. < ‘ ' 5 ' ‘

Is it true that I met a brave American soldier after seven years in hell and
shared his love? Oh, yes it is true. I don‘t have to pinch myself. Nobody can ever
take away my memories. They can't take away our short span of happiness. No
matter what happens to us now, we were together; we were happy, and it all be-
longed to us.

I remember ever so clearly many of the joyful incidents. Remember how we
used to sing the Nazi songs and how your friend made fun of Hitler by combing his
hair over his forehead and putting the comb under his nose and saluting with arm out-
stretched? I remember how you boys sang, “Don’t Fence Me In.”

Franka and Regina are in far-away countries now. How strange that I should
still be here in the land drenched with the blood of my people.

I. Do you remember how I taught you to smoke a pipe? You never smoked
but I taught you how. Everybody could find you anywhere in Kirchheim by simply
following your trail of spit.

I think often of our millions of Spitz puppies Company “F” bought ‘from me.
Your soldier friends were so jolly and kind to me. I kept little “Jimmie” for my-
self, but he was killed by a train in Dusseldorf. I would like to buy another but it
wouldn’t be the same.

I am sad when it rains. When it rained before, it mean’t you had no drill and
would come to me. We always joked and said the rainy days belonged to us; the
army could keep the Sunshiny days. And we would look for the rain as though we
were drought-stricken farmers.

Sunday was a good day, too. VVe took long walks in the countryon the edge
of Frankfurt, and picked flowers by the side of the road. Do you recall how I re-
proached you "time and again for stealing beans hanging over the farmer’s fence?
“Say, who do you think won the war, anyway?” you’d say. "

It was funny when you got angry because you’d srplutter‘ and mix up your
terrible German with English.‘ When I laughed it made you all the angrier. What a
show—off you were with your German! ‘

Sometimes I take walks alone in the dusk as we once did together. I shake
the rickety fence on the way to the Kino as you used to. I pick up stones and throw
them at tree targets to “tr_y out my pitching arm.” And I reach out in the dark
behind Marbach Kaserne and touch where the cool, ‘green corn grows.

It is hard to believe that we visited the zoo together, or saw the German
plays, and went to the Kino. One day the Americans will release me again and it
won't be a dream anymore. We shall win our fight and when we look back, we’l1 say
that two years wasn't such a long time. Today, it may be hard to believe that the
same sun shines on both of us at the same time. When it is 1 P. M. here in Frank-
furt, it is 7 P. M. in Lawrence, Massachusetts. There! You see—we are not so far
from each other. A six-hour ride on the sun, and poof! I am in your arms.

When I felt better, I sometimes visited the airfield and watched the planes
fly to America. Sometimes there were happy soldiers flying home for a furlough.
Sometimes there were laughing German Frauleins going to marry their fiances in
the United States. I don’t go there anymore. I can’t bear it.

Some people build castles in the air. My only ambition is to sew your socks
and learn to make spaghetti for you. I do not understand why they are so cruel to you.
After a war everybody builds plaques and monuments to departed heroes, but the
living ones are held in contempt.

Four summers have come and gone since first we met in Turkheim. Oh, how
long, at that! How much longer ’til our happy tears fall and blend together on
American soil?

I shall get well and then we will begin our fight all over again as we have done
so many times before. For a long while after you left I sat by the window in the
evenings half-expecting to see you coming up the walk. Once I found tears werea
temporary solace, but the fountain has almost run dry. I am still looking through
the crack in the freight-car watching German soldiers play soccer. Except for a
short period I have never left purgatory. It is not good, Jimmie. It is not good.

We might be together by Christmas, this year. I know I said the same thing
last year, and the year before that, but the main thing is that we keep on fighting
and our chins up_ From what you tell me, I have faith in the people in your country.
I can be a good American, also. I can disobey the “No Smoking” signs in the trams
like your soldier friends, and chew gum at the table. I shall get well and earn my
own living so I won't be a burden on anyone. Every week I shall visit the synagogue
and on the feast of the Passover I will celebrate and pray for our happiness. Oh, yes
my darling, we shall be very, very happy.

I have been writing too long, my beloved. I must lie down again until to-
morrow. Sei unbesorgt. Ich bin so hartnaeckig wie die Juden in Palestinan (Don't
worry. I am tough as the Jews in Israel.)

Friedel

APPEAL

“ Upon learning of Friedel’s. plight many people are appalled and ask me earnestly;
What can I do? Can I help this brave girl? I can’t believe such an outrageous thing
can happen.”

Yes, everybody can help; and much can be done from the parlor sitting-room.

Would you be willing to contribute to aid Friedel Rosenthal? A nationally-
known attorney has agreed to take the case to the courts. In addition a brief is
being prepared for the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations.

32

 

 

It will take money; even a nickel would be gratefully received. You are the
only guarantee that the fight can continue on a higher plane. It will take postage,
envelopes, stationary, phone calls and a lot of contact work.

Three years after liberation my fiancee’s health is as bad as in June, 1945.
She needs medical attention again.

She needs food and clothing. Nothing fancy. If generous people would donate ‘size
12 or 13 dresses and other clothing, and size 5 1-2 second-hand shoes, she will send
personal thanks. It will give her a great lift.

There are many other things that can ‘be done to help us win:

1. Purchase this booklet (Thirty-five cents) and order as many as you can for
your friends, or send me their names and I will mail them a copy.
Will your local stores carry this at 35 per cent discount?

2. Do you belong to a fraternal organization, a Jewish club, a union? If so,
you might set up a temporary “Free Friedel Rosenthal Committee” and send a
resolution to the President of the United States and to the Visa Division of the
State Department demanding entry for my fiancee under the GI-Fiancee Law, or the
DP Law of 1948.

3. Send a delegation or a letter to your Representative or Senator asking
them to demand release of Friedel so that she can become my wife.

4. Have at least the members of your family, and relatives, fill out the en-
closed petition.

If everybody follows out one or more of the above instructions we can get
action.

(Return booklet if not desired. Send all contributions to my address. Each
contribution shall be gratefully acknowledged by Friedel.

JAMES C. BILOTTA
333 Essex Street
Lawrence, Massachusetts
(December 1948)

POSTSCRIPT: Shortly before this pamphlet went to press Friedel arrived in England
on a temporary visa_ She is now with her sisters, Martha and Regina, at 4 Rose
Mount Lewin Street, Middlewich-Cheshire.

Now another danger arises. Bent upon Friedel’s further harassment because
of my sharp criticism of his policies. Mr. L’Heureux has alerted the U.S. Embassy
in London. Earlier the consular officials in Frankfurt with monstrous cynicism born
of deceit advised Friedel to go to England and from there emigrate to America. But
now I fear the application of U.S. diplomatic pressure to return her to Germany_

Since she is under obligation to work as a servant—girl in a British household
(which a British physician forbids due to her extreme nervous condition) it might be
ascertained that she is a drain on the national economy and thus be returned to the
jurisdiction of the U.S. Military Government in Germany.

It would be the beginning of the end. THIS MUST NOT HAPPEN.

Friedel spends most of her time in bed under the tender ministrations of her
elder sister who is shocked by the misfortunes befalling her innocent sister.

In the past three weeks her letters have assumed such a startling note that
the prolonged illness of body and heart is having its effect.

Torn between being forced to work or return to Germany she writes of com-
mitting suicide_ Her sister, Martha, cries all day long because Friedel stays in her room
and won’t eat and only wants to write letters to me.

This never happened before. The deterioration of the situation is developing so
rapidly that I am very much aggrieved. Her letters are so hysterical and incoherent
that I am afraid for her mind. I can’t get to England now because my money is being
used for this appeal, and if I could go I would lose my job without knowing whether
the Visa Division would let me bring Friedel home.

33

 
 
 

I did not want to end on this alarming note but impending tragedy stares me in
the face. Time has joined the ranks of the enemy. Martha writes that I must come
immediately “and fetch Friedel, as she is » really ill, an illness which no doctor can
cure, for it is‘ heartbrea .”

Americans must protest this abominable and entirely ‘un-American treatment
and raise their voices for Friedel’s freedom. e ' ,|

, . i
A,_ symp-athetic letter to Friedel would act as a shot ;in the arm. Packages of
food or used clothing could be sent to my address.

I am in high hopes that the American‘ people will help us win our long‘ and bitter
battle. a ’ ‘ V ‘

PETITION  

HARRY S. TRUMAN
President of the United States
White House

Washington, D. C.

~ We, the undersigned, protest the unreasonable exclusionifrom
the United States of Friede1,Rosentha1, a Jewish refugee and fiancee
of James C. Bilotta, an American combat veteran. '

We demand that Miss Rosenthal be allowed entry into our
country immediately, as is her right, under the GI-Fiancee Law, or the
DP Law of 1948, and further request that you make such a commitment.

Above othervthings your re-election is a pro-New Deal mandate

to aid minority groups and the persecuted. Prompt aid to Miss Rosen-
thal should have a high priority.

—— Franklin D. Roosevelt

goreworcl

Out of the maw of World War II and presented within these pages, is a yet-
unfolding love story of an American Combat Infantryman and Friedel Rosenthal, a

Jewish refugee.

How this story terminates depends upon an actor not yet participating in this
drama—the reader himself.

Several years have elapsed since we last saw the hostage system in operation.
It has been revived under American aegis in the same land of its origin.

I-Ioun.ded by Hitler, Germany, imprisoned in Beck’s Poland, half her family
murdered, Friedel Rosenthal, today, is perhaps the most-persecuted Jewish girl in the
U.S. Zone of Germany. She is held captive by the racists of the U.S. State Department
for no other reason than her association with an American who fought against a
Nazi revival.

Not only her future, but her life, once in the hands of Heinrich Himmler, is now
mortgaged by American reaction.

Before the’ backdrop of Israel’s betrayal by the “bipartisan” administration, a
single life may appear infinitesimal. But the case of Friedel Rosenthal is, rather, ‘a
trend, a sign of the times, perilous to Jew and Gentile alike.

History proves that once a racial or political minority is enchained, all others
eventually suffer a like fate. An injury to one is an injury to all. It’ is an inescapable
axiomatic fact.

A gentle, middle-born Semite, inmate of five concentration camps, Friedel Ros-
enthal has been consigned to the limbo of lost Jews in Western Germany by the U.S.
Counter-Intelligence Corps, the consular service, and the State Department.

The Brown Plague has disappeared but the Khaki Epidemic moves into the vacuum.
The Gestapo is no more, but the U.S.-sponsored Abwehr with the same faces, operates.
The SS is gone, but the CIC proves a pale substitute. Low-cuts replace the jackboot;
guttural byslang. '

Miss Rosenthal, an unsung Jewish heroine, my fiancee, was once liberated by the
hero-soldiers of the 36th Infantry Division. She must be re-liberated by the American
people themselves.

Therefore, this appeal.

EXILE

“ONLY ONE SUITCASE EACH.”

Dusseldorf. The pogroms had begun. In the cold October night fiery synagogues
became a backdrop for the demoniacal drama.

Doors to Jewish shops were forced. Windows were smashed and Brown Shirts
danced away with the loot.

Blood flowed in the streets. Protesting recalcitrants lay kicking in the gutter.
Rabbis in night-clothes, were dragged from bed by their beards.

The Rosenthal family was swept up in the aktion. The twins, Regina and
Friedel, aged fourteen, rubbed sleepy eyes in fright as burly SS men tossed the piano
out the window- The fashionable middle-class home of Herr Rosenthal, tobacconist
and confectioner, was a shambles in a few minutes. Little pajama-clad Bernard
crawled out of bed and cowered in his mother’s arms.

Max and Martha escaping to England months earlier with the help of the Zionist
organization, had foreseen the whole picture. Hans and his family were already enroute
to the railroad s.tation——and Poland. '

‘‘We’ll give you one hour to pack! The SS commanded the Rosenthals. “Only
one suitcase each!”

Home-s along the strasse were vomiting, sobbing, stunned humanity. Sirens
whined. The smell of burning wood, guttural commands, and screaming mothers,
torn from tots, made an eerie spectacle. A four-year old‘ curly-top clasped the knees
of an offizier, begging him not to leave behind his teddy-bear.

“Lift your slow-poke legs, Saba!” Cried an expectan.t six-year old pulling his
bewildered sister. “We must catch a seat behind the engine.”

It was 1938, fifth year of the “thousand—year Reich.”

SEPARATIONS

Poland was a carbon-copy of Germany. Aping Poles raided the internee lagers,
molested the women, and gleefully snipped rabbis’ beards. ‘

When the Germans came again in 1939 Hans joined the Polish Arm_y. He, his
wife, and two children, were never heard from again.

Herr Rosenthal died of starvation. Eighty-nine year old “Nana” could not keep
up and was dispatched with a bullet in Czestochowa. Frau Rosenthal was gassed and
cremated in Treblinka in 1942. Bernard was taken away in the male transport. The
twins were alone.

The story of Friedel Rosenthal is multiplied by six million case histories
monotonous in horror and repetition. It is the story of the Jew as he spanned the cen-
turies since Moses.

gA>nti-Semitism has proved a profitable venture for some. On no other vehicle,
harnessed to a scapegoat, could one ride to power and corral flush pots of gold at the end
of the anti-Semitic rainbow intone fell swoop.

Seven years behind barbed wire were for Friedel, an existence lower than that
of a jungle beast. Thin potato soup, mouldy black bread», and slimy sugar beets. Daily
roll-calls, death-thinned ranks, and new “'1‘odeska.ndida.ten” (candidates for death)
from all over Europe.

Denuding lice from her blue-and-white “K-Z” (concentration camp) uniform in
a ‘patch of sunlight were moments of joy for Friedel. She filched thick potato jackets
from the garbage heap behind the kitchen and devoured them without qualm. Ticks
multiplied in the straw pallet. A bare-back flogging in Czestochowa made a striped tat-
too of her torso. Regina took sick with typhus and nearly succumbed but for her sis-
ter’s desperate care.

RETURN TO GERMANY

Before Red Army hammer-blows in January, 1945, Jewish transports shuttled to
the West. Sealed box"-cars packed with 120 occupants each with hardly any food and
less water proved traps from which many emerged lifeless.

3

On the two-week trip to Belsen women slept on each other or stood against one
another in a partial crouch like in a Georgia sweat-box. Switching off to a siding
after a Yank air-raid Friedel _peered through a slit at German soldiers playing soccer.

How she yearned for the clean woods behind Dusseldorf where she spent so
many happy days gamboling about and picnicking with the family! She wept for her
bicycle, for pickled herring, and lentil soup with a chunk of pork. Shed love to go in
her father’s shop again and munch on a piece of chocolate. '

Bergen—Belsen, at last—near Dusseldorf. Almost seven year:, and back in Ger-
many again. The women paraded stark naked before the camp guards as they took
a shower in the woods. ' _

Then the transport moved on to other camps to the South. Burgau, in Austria,
and back to Bavaria in the concentration camp of Turkheim.

ON THE LINE

WE CATCH HELL AT OBERHOFFEN

In six months, from civvies to ship, they made me an infantryman. On December
9th 1944 I joined the famed 36th Division in Alsace-Lorraine. As soon as we arrived the
supply sergeant proceeded to divest us of our overcoats, new packs, combat boots,
mess-kits, and bayonets. We wondered if they were going to allow us to keep our
squirrel guns to fight with. I didn’t fancy ending up like the Spartans at Thermopylae—
biting the enemy to death. The sarge said Jerry made short shrift of any “dough”
caught with sharp weapons. For the umpteenth time I cussed the hot days I sp-ent
uselessly under a Georgia sun sticking s-teel into dummies. They didn’t “go by the book”
here. The Second Johns back at Wheeler would have split a seam had they learned
about the conspiracy against their tutoring.

The Germans celebrated my advent four days later by surrounding the whole
division. It was a helluva mess and Sherman was right. Some of the new guys were
ready to let Jerry pick up the marbles.

Muddy and moody we “sweat out” Jerry as he suddenly switched to the offensive.
It was winter. He should’ve been in his hole polishing hob-nails. ‘

The brand-new 42nd Rainbow moved up and snuggled into the line at Strasbourg.
The doughs took one peep at the Rhine and said: “Why give us rowboats and we'll
cross that creek.” Those were famous last words. Jerry heard them, crossed the
creek himself, and sent half the Rainbow to Kingdom Come.

The 10th Panzer was playing rough from -Weyersheim to Bischwiller, the center
of the 36th defensive are. We knocked off Rohrwiller after the Germans re-captured
it from one of our regiments. I spent two nights there in a fox.-hole belly-deep in
water and scared nigh to death. Company “F” was plank in the middle between a
Yank-Jerry tank duel. Tree-bursts got some of the men. I saw my first dead GI with his
face buried in the swamp. His helmet was as-kew and neat, black curly hair protruded
from underneath. The war had come close to home.

In a snow-suit assault across the Moder River and an open plain, we took Ober-
hoffen on midnight January 31st. We lost it promptly the next morning .Storm-
troopers of the 257th Volksgrenadier Division engaged us in pitched battle, their
Royal Tiger tanks against our M-ls. Because our armor didn’t come through we were
forced ignominiously to retreat across the field in broad daylight. 79th Division
mortars, mistaking our prisoners for attackers, opened up, killing both Jerries and
Gflslhof fthfadsecond platoon while German machine-guns raked our lines from both ends
0 e ie .

. lt was a rough morning._ Tigers rumbled up one street and down the other de-
molishing GI-held’ houses at point-blank range killing all defenders. One GI raised his
hands in surrender and was murdered on the spot.

_ Enraged, we returned to Bischwiller. On the hill overlooking the field strewn
with Jerries and Yanks was a long row of tanks. When we saw tankers playing with
French girlsand throwing snow-balls we were ready for a civil war right then and

Oberhoffen was the key to the Moder River Line. For six days T-Patchers
faced the most savage fighting of their careers. So strong and so dogged was the
fighting that seasoned veterans recall the victory there with amazement.

The next day, supplied anew, we returned. The town was just about flattened.
Fires were raging. The smell of sewage and burning wood? pinched the nostrils. Friend
and foe, clay-like in death, littered the streets and wreckage. German bodies were

expeditiously “liberated.” Valuables, photographs, papers and chow littered the streets.
VVeeping and stunned Alsatians were salvaging goods from their homes turned into
infernoes.

Prisoners were coming in, in single file with their hands placed on their heads,
a watchful GI at each end of the line. Grim GIs relieved them of pistols and cameras-.
Manjy wore GI combat boots and watches frisked from dead doughs.

SLEEPING WITH JERRY

The in—fighting was terrific and the noise thunderous. Our own planes came over
dropping stuff on us. This war was run exactly like Fore River Shipyard—bumbling
inefficiency and lack of coordination.

That night I slept in a cellar on a dead Jerry and beside a wounded German
lieutenant. The-re was absolutely no room anywhere else to lie down. The dead
man must have been hiding from our shelling. He was on one knee his head under a
table as though searching for some kind of protection. His back was level with my
elevated mattress on a potato pile and provided a soft resting-place for my feet. We
were on the usual combat relief of one hour on one hour off. When my relief came
it was his turn to sleep on Jerry. Looking back it seems kind of ghoulish.

The lieutenant was in terrible pain with a leg wound. Our medics dressed it and
he lay there moaning for six days. The shelling wouldn't let up enough for us to take
him out. He said he’d just come from the Eastern Front and had never seen the beat
of Red Artillery. The “Reds,” lining up their guns before an assault, 300 pieces every
kilometer (five—eights of a mile) and almost hub to hub, would plough up a wide swath
within which no life could exist. “The fighting is much easier in the West,” he said.
He thought we were foolish to be fighting Germans. He said American and Germans
should team up and move on to Moscow.

The line was fluctuating and Germans were bumping into our positions. I
sat with my automatic rifle at a hole in the side of the house facing Jerry. Night
and day I sat there as though in an opera box watching a play. Fires were raging on
all sides. A goat with a broken leg, pinioned by fallen timber, nearly drove us whacky
with his baa-ing until a GI put him out of his misery. “Love” company on our left fro-nt
was night-fighting. Small arms fire and grenades beat a steady din interspersed by the
swift staccato of a Jerry machine-gun and their cantankerous “Berp” guns.

JERRY GIVES UP THE GHOST

Duval,' on our right front, tommy-gunned a German directly before my eyes.
Snow fell on him as he lay on the ground face down in the muck. Moaning, “Hilfel
Hilfe!” he got up and stumbled to the hole in the house. I gave him a hand and pulled
him up inside. He danced around gingerly from the burning pain as Sergeant Walsh
liberated his expensive watch and a .38, then sent him to the medics-.

Jerries, searching for their outfit, bumped into us all night. We simply snagged
them in one by one. It was a nice way to fight a w_ar. ‘

Daylight brought the 88's in. Whoosh! Boom! Whoosh! Boom! all day long. Our
planes bombed the railroad station in front of us and a host of Germans surrendered.
Love company bagged twenty-one prisoners in one house alone. ’

We were taking Oberhoffen the hard way. Heinrich Himmler sent out a
special order to his SS troops: “What the Americans did in Selestat, you must do here.”
They cut the 142nd in two, broke through the town, were cut off, attacked again. We
captured our 20,000th prisoner in Oberhoffen.

The fighting had its light moments. One of the men we dubbed the “Deacon”
didn’t like to hear irreverent words on the line. He pleaded with us not to curse.
That's all we'd need to let go with a string of pearly epithets. Once Jerry hit our
house, and the Deacon, on the first floor above, came sliding down the stairs on his
rump into a nest of cursing, air-bluing GIs heating D rations. He pleaded with us
not to swear so we redoubled our efforts laughing uproariously.

The Deacon was cracking up so they sent him to anti-tank. Anti-tank was
rear echelon. They just polished their “75” and got the medals while we saw what color
eyes Jerry had.

Despite Himmler Oberhoffen fell. It was probably the most destroyed town in
Alsace-Lorraine. We heard later that a French architect would experiment with
Oberhoffen to rebuild other towns because the job had to be done from scratch.

Every day ‘of the fall and winter campaigns saw lengthy casualty lists. In the
Vosges ‘and Alsatian campaigns the 36th received 6000 Purple Hearts. It received the
third highest casualty record of the war. The other first two divisions were also in
Patch’s Seventh Army of which we were a part.

On the Eastern Front the Russians had just gone 300 kilometers in eighteen
days. We watched them daily in the Stars & Stripes, cheering Uncle Joe and his GIs
on. Guys back in the hospital doing a “million-dollar lick,” were glued to the radio.
They didn’t want to return to the line. Every Jerry Joe bagged was one less for us.
Every Red Army Man falling before the guns of the fascists meant that one more of
our GIs would see the States again. There was no red-baiting in fox—ho1es

III
THE GENERAL OFFENSIVE

DEATH IN THE WOODS

At midnight on the Ides of March the whole front erupted. No artillery pre-
paration. The same old “surprise,” only the enemy always seemed to know about
the surprises before the attacks. We slogged across the Moder again and for six hours
fought Jerry’s 88s, tanks, and mortars with only rifles and grenades. No wonder
Seventh Army Divisions had the highest casualties. Our guys cussed Patch and said
that if he wouldn't shove his artillery up front he could shove it up his behind.

Jerry had machine-gun cross-fire, heavy barbed-wire protection, and all the
defilades zeroed in. We counted ten dead GIs and one Second John piled atop the other
in a ditch near a bridge. ‘

 

Flares exposed our guys horribly on the open field. They were like sitting _

ducks. Mortars came in. Ralph Winner was hit in the face with a piece of flying
flesh. Lt. Markoochi carried a wounded man on his back across the river. We couldn't
get through. .

We lost Joe Magneziewski who made the landing at Salerno. Tall, manly, and
courageous, he wanted to go home after the war and just clerk in his mother’s store
in Albany. Sergeant Rodney identified Joe ten days later. Hit directly by a mortar
shell, they picked up what was left of him in a bed-sack.

At six A. M., the “surprise” over, and our ranks decimated, the artillery opened
up. We went through this time in another sector but Jerry was on the lam. A half-
mile deep mine-field, sowed with hundreds of Schuh—mines covered over with leaves,
knocked off the legs and t€StlC1€S| of thirty-five guys in the battalion.

A sniper sent a bullet through Duva1’s brain and made a widow and one father-
less child in one second flat. Markoochi, a new man, tried’ to hide behind a tree.
Picolomini, a Cassino veteran, screamed at him not to kneel down, but he did—on a
quarter-pound of dynamite. His leg was a massof blood, flesh, and charcoal, his face
stunned and calm through the soot.

The whole front was pushing, riding and slogging night and day. We went
through Wissembourg into Germany on March 21st. At .Ober-Otterbach our troops
engaged the enemy at every point. BAR fire and the whirring shoosh of Jerry
macfhine:-guns rent the night air. Potato mashers and GI grenades were being exchanged
up ron. * »

‘At the bottom of the hill the town was on fire. The underbrush all around
us burned contours along the hills. Underfooting was precarious and our leather soles
slipped on the dry leaves. My BAR weighed a ton.

SITTING DUCKS BY THE DRAGON ’S TEETH

“We rested for an hour at a house on the edge of town. At midnight we attacked.
It was the Spring equinox—a night for love, not for fighting.

_ _ The battalion was strung out along the bottom of a steephill. Jerry was on top
sitting in pill-bo_xes three feet thick defended by an apron of barbed—wire five feet
high and rolled in triple curls. He heard us as we pulled ourselves up the sixty per-
Eﬁatbilrécline on our bellies. He let go with rhythmic machine-gun fire. We were in for

Flares made us feel naked as we hugged the ground. Tracers cut a swath two
feet above our prone bodies searching for human targets. I cursed Captain Goff. He
said it was only a road block. It was our first Siegfried Line pill-box. Like beads of
concrete they were strung out all around peripheral Germany.

Wepreached the wire. Potato mashers lobbed over the apron, exploded in our faces.

Two guys cutting the wire, died with clippers in their hands. Both were wounded
once before. One was engaged to be married; the other hailed from mountain count
and had three children. ry
