inal Syndicalism cases, which had been filed in June, 1941. In
mid-Iune, 1942, three weeks after the Attorney General's decision
was issued, Morris filed his brief, and quoted at length from
Biddle's statements on the Communist Party. »

In Congress, Representative John Rankin of Mississippi, de-
scribed by Washington columnist Charles Van Devander as "the
Mississippi apostle of white Anglo—Saxon supremacy and the poll
tax," read most of the Biddle decision into the "Congressional
Record" and attacked those who oppose it.

Patriotic newspapers were quick to repudiate these attacks on
national unity. The "Chicago Sun" declared editorially on May
31, 1942 ‘

"Attomey General Biddle's 32-page opinion . . . is one of
the most incredible documents that has ever come from a
high government official of the United States. If the de-
portation order is sustained by the Supreme Court on the
record made in this case, the Bill of Rights may as well be

.torn out of the Constitution and thrown away, for it will no
longer» exist . . . no American citizen who values his own
liberties or those of his fellow citizens can afford to over-
look this assault upon them. . . .

"Let us hope that this may turn out to be some legalistic
abracadabra which will emerge in its true light and can be
explained as such to our fighting Allies. At first sight, it
looks_to a layman like a tragic boner."

The "New Republic” on June 8, 1942, in an editorial on the deci- \

sion said '

"Viewed as a whole, it seems one of the most stupid, ill
advised, undemocratic actions in recent years. '

"Mr. Biddle . . . rules that the Communist Party is a revo-
lutionary organization. He goes back to the Communist Mani-
festo of 1848 . . . for evidence of this. But in fact, this is just

legalistic nonsense. It is like saying that the Democrats are
now in favor of states’ rights and the Republicans in favor
of Federalism, just because this was true in 1860. . . ."

I. F. Stone of Washington, writing in "The Nation" of June 13,
1942, said »

"I am reliably informed that Mr. Biddle has decided not to
press the case against Coughlin. (The Coughlin case has not
been revived as of September 9, l942——Ed.)

"The question I would like to raise is: are the political con-
siderations which argue against the prosecution of a pro-
fascist Catholic agitator of a higher order than those which
argue against the deportation of an 'anti—fascist trade union
leader? . . . the most pressing and immediate argument
against the deportation of Bridges rests on the fact that he
and the Communist Party, whatever their motives, are now
doing their best to support the government in its war ef-
fort. . . .

"Neither before Landis nor Sears was any testimony heard
in behalf of the Communist Party. Thus a point of great
political importance at this time, with the widest repercussions
in foreign relations and domestic affairs, was decided by
Biddle on the basis of testimony from one side only."

a

The editorial in the ”Washington Post," leading newspaper in
the capital, is typical of dozens in the press. The "Post" said on
May 30, 1942

"He (Mr. Bridges) has been one of the most active agents
on the Pacific Coast in building up the labor—management
committees in industry which have done a great deal to aid
the production effort .» . . it is evident that he is wedded to the
national cause of smashing the Axis, and that he will allow
no personal spleen on the score of the new decision to divert ‘
him."

The "Post" added

"It is obvious that the deportation order against Mr. Bridges
cancels any contribution to national unity which may have
flowed from the release of Mr. Browder."

9

  

Assemblyman Morris Mintz of New York declared publicly on
May 30, 1942, that he had wired President Roosevelt asking him
to reverse the Attorney General's order, because "the decision
could not have been better designed to hamper our war effort had
it been written on the Wilhelmstrasse." '

Mr. Mintz_ said

"I am a Democrat and know little about Communist philos-
ophy. But what I do know is that Mr. Bridges has been and
is today supporting our fight against fascism. I do know that
the Communist Party is vigorously supporting the war effort.
And finally, I do know that in every country where fascism
came to power, it began by banning minority political par-
ties. The latter, in fact, is the classi.c technique of fascism.
Can we afford to adopt that technique? . . . When our national
existence is secured beyond any attack, there will be time
and opportunity enough to argue about future social direc-
tions for America. Until such security is won, an action such

as Mr. Biddle's can do inca1culable———and perhaps irreparable
—damage." -

-_._..‘,_... _,

This is not the story of Harry Bridges. Nor is it the complete
story of the Biddle decision. ,

It can only serve as a summary and a synopsis.

The Biddle decision has served a dangerous purpose. Its use
by the appeasers and seditionists is clear proof of this.

Like the Axis propaganda techniques described by the Office of
Facts and Figures in "Divide and Conquer," it is being used to
create prejudice and to divide the American people. '

The Biddle decision opened the door to "redbaiting." Yet if this
war against the Axis has taught us anything, it is that fascism
creeps into a nation's life in the guise of "anti—communism," and
that democracy can only survive through vigorous protection of
political freedom and liberty.

The Biddle decision has been used to destroy the rights of loyal
minority parties. In the Ohio election.case the link was clear and
direct. In other election cases, it has motivated attacks on politi-
cal minorities, given quasieofficial assurance that such attacks
were consistent with the policy of a government official.

The Biddle decision attacks all organized labor.

Our country has learned that the War can be Won only through
the unity and cooperation of those on the battle and production
lines, that our destiny rests on organized labor and the loyalty
and- strength of the men and women behind the men behind the
guns.

The Biddle decision was summary and unjust. It ignored the
findings of Dean James M. Landis and the Board of Immigration
Appeals and accepted, without challenge, the testimony of wit-
nesses unanimously discredited by that Board.

On Labor Day, September 7, 1942, in clear and forceful lan-
guage, President Roosevelt told the American people that he
would invokehis wartime powers to the full, and would take all
steps required for the defeat of the Axis and for the preservation
of our country.
‘ 11

 “""':"“'~"*5‘-'r'~:s-rs!»-zvzav-emv-n1'\n'»':-:!'rﬁi1‘~3.__,. - , '3‘ '-

  

One of these steps must be reversal of the Biddle decision.
Harry Bridges must be permitted to obtain American citizen-
ship, and to continue his vigorous work for victory over fascism.

The arbitrary decision of the Attorney General, an administra-
tive finding which reaction would imbue with the force of law,
must be erased from the record.

The unity, regardless of race, creed, color, national origin, or
political belief, of all patriotic, pro-war Americans, must be main-
tained and extended.

Millions of Americans have expressed their opposition to the
Attorney General's decision in letters, resolutions, and statements.
Hundreds of news stories and editorials have reflected their views.

Now more than 600 prominent Americans unite in an appeal

_to the President of the United States. They ask the President to

use his wartime powers in a just and necessary cause. They
ask him to rescind the Biddle decision. '
These people are America. They are distinguished, patriotic
citizens. They are leaders in the clergy, in education, in public
life, in organized labor. They speak for their country.
This is their letter to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Their plea must not go unheeded.

July 11, 1942
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:

It is in the interests of the American people and victory over
the Axis, rather than in the interests of the individual Harry
Bridges alone, that we address this open letter to_you, to urge re-
consideration of the order of Attorney General Biddle for Mr.
Bridges’ deportation. .

In the last few days we have given careful consideration to
the far—reaching effects of the Attorney General's order. To the
best of our ability, we have analyzed the public response, and
have found organized labor shocked and concerned, government
production chiefs and patriotic industrial leaders deeply dis-
turbed, many newspaper editors.and columnists critical'—and the

appeasement, anti-war forces of the country, along with the offi— '

cial Axis propaganda bureaus, delighted by the decision.
Within a few days after Mr. Biddle announced his decision,
Senator Reynolds, opponent of many measures necessary to win
the war and critic of your administration of our wartime govern-
ment, called for deportation not only of Bridges but of "thousands

of others," and urged that the Communist Party be outlawed.~

An appeasement columnist, giving only lipservice to the cause of
the United States, utilized the decision to launch a flagrantly scur-
rilous attack on Mrs. Roosevelt. And Radio Berlin, in its broad-
casts beamed tb the United States, used the Biddle decision to
attack American collaboration with Russia in the fight against the
Axis.

Certainly these incidents by themselves prove that the deci-

'sion of the Attorney General jeopardizes our war effort, not in

terms of production———it is clear that labor will continue to surpass
its own high records—but in terms of national morale. Mr. Biddle's
decision was described by one commentator as "the blunder for
which pro—Axis propagandists have been waiting." It is exactly
that, through its negation of the cause for which we are fighting
and its contradiction of your pledge that all loyal residents of our
country would find a place in this fight, judged by one criterion
only—-wholehearted, unequivocal, sacrificial support of the war.

Our fight for freedom and against the tyranny of the Axis
has brought. home to the American people the meaning of fas-
cism. For nine years, we have watched the rise of fascism in
Germany. and its encroachment upon other lands and peoples.

13

 

   

 

 

We have seen the pattern repeat itself: destruction of powerful
trade unions, persecution of the Iewish people, suppression of the
Catholic church, loss of the right of free worship, and outlawing
of the Communist Party, the inevitable first step towards the ban-
ishment of democracy and the enslavement. of free peoples.

We have seen Hitler and the Axis use the slogan "anti-
communism" to thrust upon the world brutality and violence un-
precedented in human history. We have seen the Lavals and
Petains of both hemispheres using the same slogans to carry
on their work, seeking everywhere to divide and conquer the
people and prevent them from achieving victory over fascism.

Your statement on May 16th, 1942, that you were commuting
the sentence of Earl Browder because it would have "a tendency
to promote national unity" was acclaimed by all Americans with
a real understanding of the needs of unity and national morale.

The Government's evidence on the character of the Commu-
nist Party was put in through the testimony of thoroughly dis-
credited witnesses most of whose testimony on other phases of
the case was disbelieved both by Inspector Sears and the Board
of Immigration Appeals. In view of the Attorney General’s com-
ment that he hopes the Bridges case will become a "test case of
communism" it must be pointed out that the Communist Party
was not a party to the deportation proceedings and that at no
time were any of its officials subpoenaed or invited to present ac-
curate evidence on its position.

The constitution of the Communist Party, adopted in 1938 and
a matter of public record since that time, declares its unequivocal

opposition to any "clique, group, circle, faction or party which '

conspires or acts to subvert, undermine, weaken or overthrow
any or all institutions of American democracy." Whatever one
conceives the political principles of the Communist Party to be,
there can be no question of its unreserved support of the war
program.

Because the decision rendered by Mr. Biddle in the case of
Harry Bridges can only serve to undermine our national morale,
and because it has already been used to create distrust of aliens
and of labor leaders, we urge upon you the necessity of directing

reconsideration. We make this plea not alone in justice to Harry '

Bridges, alien and labor leader, but in justice to Harry Bridges,
fighting leader of the men behind the fighting lines, forceful asset

14

to our war effort, vigorous spokesman for unity behind the war.

We recognize that your executive powers in this war emer-
gency are extraordinary. It is our belief that executive action is
required to prevent the execution of Mr. Biddle's order or the
necessity of entering at this time, upon what will inevitably be
protracted and disruptive litigation. It is equally essential that
the Attorney General’s ill-advised, arbitrary, and unwarranted
findings relative to the Communist Party be rescinded.

We believe, therefore, that you must offset the dangerous as-
pects of the Attorney General's order by a positive and immedi-
ate reaffirmation of the rights of labor, and of all loyal racial,

religious and political groups, to full participation in the war.
In the interests of national unity and victory over the Axis, we
urge you to use your executive authority to rescind the Attorney

General’s decision.

"Bridges' own statement of his political beliefs and disbeliefs is
important. It was given not,only without reserve, but vigorously
as dogma and faiths of which the man was proud, and which pre-
sented in -his mind the aims of his existence. . . . That Bridges’ aims
are energetically radical may be admitted, but the proof fails to
establish the methods he seeks to employ to realize them are

other than those that the framework of democratic and constitu-
tional government permits." '

—Dean James M. Landis, ''In the Matter of
Harry R. Bridges," December, 1939.

"Our first job is winning the war and this decision will not deter
us in any Way from that goal. My deportation has never been
and is not now the issue. It was the fight for union conditions
and against Fascist aggression conducted" by my union which led
to the origination of the charge of Communism against me. '

"I am urging all union men and women to redouble their fight

against Hitler and the Axis to make up for the damage caused by
the Attorney General.”

——Harry R. Bridges, May 28, 1942.

_‘“"5“'TTT2“L*  _.,- » ’ 44‘-

The story goes back many .years.

It starts with a young Australian seaman entering the United
States, legally and inconspicuously.

It follows a narrow, sheltered trail through the twenties, jumps
from the clocks to ships at sea, from one coast city to another.

It is anonymous—until 1933.

Then San Francisco, with the Blue Eagle flying from the city's
masts, and the NRA promising workers the right of -organization.

The longshoremen's union, crushed in 1919, diverted into in-
famous "Blue Book" company unionism, comes back to life.

The longshoremen organize. The seamen follow their leadership.

The years pass, 1934 recedes—the year is 1942.

Eight years of able and courageous leadership have brought

the West Coast longshoremen equalization of emp1oyment—they
call it decasualization in government reports—a "union hiring hall,
the basic six—hour day, a decent wage rate, safety standards, '
security.
V But they have more: -they are an integral part of America at
. war. The Maritime Industry Board, with joint emp1oyer—union—
government representation, works to make the waterfront click
in the war effort.

The men do their job—‘from the gang steward in the smallest
port to the President of the International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union, Harry Bridges.

__. . I._.#__‘_..,._. ~———.

_May 28, 1942. _

Weatherreports read "Clear and continued fair."

On the aircraft production lines in California, men and women
hurry to. build planes to bomb Berlin and Tokio.

The morning shift turns to in a Montana mine producing cop-
per for war.

On the San Francisco docks, longshore gangs show their
brasses, shift lunchboxes under their arms, and walk to shipside.

It is eight o'clock in California. ‘

In Washington it is eleven. In a paneled office in the dignified
building of the Department of Justice, reporters gather to receive

3

 

  

the Attorney General's decision in the case of Harry Benton
Bridges, longshoreman, labor leader, alien.

Many of them had gathered in the same office a half dozen
times in the past to hear a new decision in the case of Harry
Bridges: '

In December, 1939, the historic decision of Dean Iames M. Landis
of Harvard University Law School clearing Bridges of charges

against himhad been handed them by the Secretary of Labor.

A few months later they met there to hear that the warrant of
arrest against Bridges had been cancelled.

In December, 1940, they flocked to the Department of Iustice
to find out the meaning of a press statement in Miami by I. Edgar
Hoover, that the Bridges case had been reopened.

In February, 1941, they found out, when a new warrant was
issued. .

In November, 1941, they gathered for the Sears decision-
against Bridges.

Three months later, in Ianuary, I942, the unanimous decision
of the Board of Immigration Appeals of the Department of Jus-
tice, sustaining Bridges and overruling Sears, was released in
this same room. .

Now it was May, 1942, our sixth month in the war. Superficially
the circumstances, the personnel, the issues were the same. But
the times had changed. ‘

The case of Harry Bridges had ceased to be the case of an

-individual held for deportation. It had become a cause celebre, a

war issue.

Bridges, the longshoremen's union, the CIO, the organized
workers of America, had made history beween December 7,
1941, and May 28, 1942.

Labor—management committees were smashing production rec-
ords considered incredible a few months before, and making
new ones.

Ships were being sunk in shocking numbers by Axis sub-
marines—but new ships to replace them were coming off pro-
duction lines in days instead. of months.

Union carpenters on W'ake, union teamsters on the Burma
road, union soldiers in the Army, union longshoremen on the
Pacific Coast, were united for victory. ~.

War had come to America, welding the people, building unity.

May was a’ critical month.

May saw the fall of Corregidor and the final siege of Sevastopol.

May was the month of the Anglo—Soviet agreements and of
Molotov's visit to America.

May was the third spring of the war, the beginning of the
critical summer of 1942.

The Washington correspondents discussed the case- as they
Waited. There was unanimity: Biddle would sustain the Board
of Immigration Appeals. The evidence dictated this course. So
did precedent: no Attorney General had ever overruled the Board
of Appeals. __

This then would have been their lead: "Attorney General Biddle
today sustained the unanimous findings of the Board of Immigra-
tion Appeals and cancelled the Warrant of arrest against Harry
Bridges, West Coast CIO longshore leader. In San Francisco,
Mr. Bridges immediately announced that he would apply for his
second papers and seek to obtain American citizenship as rapidly
as possible. He announced, smiling slightly, that he was grati-
fied by the Attorney General’s decision, but that he had ex-
pected it."

That lead was never Written. Nor did Harry Bridges make that
statement. .

The Biddle decision ordering the deportation of Harry Bridges
crashed like a bomb on Wartime America.

In San Francisco, Harry Bridges, serious and unsmiling, dic-
tated a telegram to War Production Chief Donald Nelson

"I wish to assure you that despite the outrageous decision of
Attorney General ‘Biddle, and numerous protests already
pouring in ‘from Workers, I will do all possible to offset any
effect it might have on the production program and labor-

5

 

  

management unity, and will urge all workers and unions 1
can inﬂuence to redouble their efforts in speeding produc-
tion to win the main fight against the Axis."

In a thousand cities and towns the headlines of afternoon pa-

papers" screamed "Bridges Ordered Deported," or "Biddle Ousts _

Bridges."

In Washington's file rooms and restaurants, in its crowded
offices and in the corridors of the Capitol, the story spread—"Did
you hear? Biddle overruled the Board of Immigraton Appeals.
He ordered Bridges deported!" '

The question echoed on the West Coast docks, in the plane
plants, on the subways, in the woods, on the nation's production
lines, wherever workers gathered. -

It reechoed in the press, in editorials, in the columns, on the
radio. Clergymen spoke of it from the pulpit. Educators discussed
it in faculty lunchrooms.

This was no sacrosanct legal decision. « It was not the finding

_of a Supreme Court guided by the interests of the nation. It was

an arbitrary decision of an Attorney General, a cynical, narrow
determination. _
The Axis radio made clear that it was no routine deportation
order. ‘

On May 29, 1942, less than 24 hours after the decision was
released, the CBS monitoring service heard a Nazi news com-
mentator declare

"Bridges obviously is one of the small thieves who are
hanged while the big ones like Stalin get away and are even
being made allies."

Radio Berlin added a day later

"Attorney General Biddle gave a very good resume of the
Communist Party's policy to overthrow the U. S. Govern-
ment. . . . By the remarks of the Attorney General, Roose- -
velt’s Moscow policy is brought into a peculiar light."

American appeasement echoed the Axis cry. In Washington,
Senator Robert R. Reynolds of North Carolina, in an "exclusive"
interview with the Hearst International News Service declared

' "Bridges should not be permitted to make the trip out of the
country alone. There are thousands of others who ought to be
deported or put into concentration camps and held there
until we can get rid of them. . . . The Communist Party. should
be barred from political tickets and forbidden to engage in
political enterprises." »

The tocsin sounded. The appeasers might well have said
openly: let's use the Biddle decision to smash national unity.

The decision, accompanied by laudatory editorials, was se-
rialized in the Hearst papers. I

The seditious press, the publications of many of those indicted
in Iuly by the Federal Grand Jury in Washington, D. C., picked up
the decision and used it as a vehicle for their treason.

On Iune 2, I942, Iohn E. Sweeney, Secretary of State in Ohio,
ruled the Communist Party off the ballot in that state.

His action followed by three days the publication of an. ad-
vance story by International News Service in the ”Daily Legal
News and Cleveland Recorder" of May 30, 1942. Headed
”Sweeney to Use Biddle Decision to Rule Communists Off Bal-
lot," the INS. story of May 29, 1942, from Columbus, Ohio, said
in part

"In line with U. S. Attorney General Biddle's opinion in
ordering the deportation of Harry Bridges, Secretary of State
Iohn E. Sweeney will rule the Communist Party off the Ohio
ballot, it was learned today. . . .

"It was learned that Sweeney, in ruling the Communists off
the ballot, will point to Biddle's opinion in the Bridges case
citing that the Communist Party did ’advise, advocate and
teach the overthrow, by force and violence, of’ the govern-
ment of the United States.’ "'

Lewis Morris, Oklahoma prosecutor, waited until after .the
Biddle decision to answer the appeal brief in the Oklahoma Crim-
