How Many Do You Know . . 4 and How Well?

This memo is written at the request of a group of veterans of this war,
now honorably discharged for medical or other reasons.

But in writing it, I feel I am speaking too for Hank Forbes and Robert
Fritzmeyer, for Philip Childs and Jerry Weinberg, for Sam Banks and
I Alexander Suer, and for all those other Communists who have fulﬁlled
with their lives the Communist pledge on the day of Pearl Harbor——
to give “their loyalty,their devoted labor and last drop of their blood
in support of our country in this greatest of all the crises that ever
threatened its existence.”
I express the sentiments too, I am sure; of those thousands of Commu-
nists who are “upholding the United States by force and violence” on
the active ﬁghting fronts in Europe,~the South Paciﬁc, Burma, or other
far-oﬁ‘ outposts.
This is an attempt to answer brieﬂy some of the questions which are
asked of us Communist veterans .  by fellow-veterans and fellow-
citizens who have become aware of the Communist Political Associa-

tion for the ﬁrst time through this war and its awakening inﬂuences. .

It is our hope that this thumbnail introduction will encourage you to
want to know more about us and our Association . . . and even perhaps
to join us.

ROBERT THOMPSON is a veteran of two wars
against gfascism. In Spain, in 1937-38, he was

Another thing about veterans who belong to 
our Association. Not one of us considers his dis"-77 '1  
charge from military service to be at furlough,
from the ﬁght to win the war. We feel a" special
responsibility to our buddies who are still in _
the front lines slugging it out with our German »
and Japanese enemy. In order to measure up to A‘
that responsibility we feel we have to ﬁght as‘
hard on the home front for policies that will
speed the day of ..victory, and ensure lasting *
peace, as they are ﬁghting on the battlefronts‘.

Yes, we veterans have changed fronts but not
wars. Together with our fellow members of the
Communist Political Association, as a part of‘, the
great democratic majority of American citizens,
we are now ﬁghting on the home front for the '
same things that we were yesterday ﬁghting for
on the battlefronts. We are backing to the limit
our Commander-in-Chief, President Truman, -in
his great task of carrying forward the policies of

A Roosevelt. A p , A V of A ' ‘

jsornethiiig from our organization thatno other?» , .5, 

 -organizaftion in America can give them. / P  l

” ‘~ ; Each of us is an active member of one or more

P organizations, such as a major political party, ’ ‘ P
a trade union local, or veterans’ organization. ‘
As members, we participate in the activities of
these bodies and take part in their democratic

processes of determining policy and arriving at
decisions. We must have opinions on the big
questions of the day confronting our country
and the labor movement, and we want these,
opinions to be sound ones, which will contribute
to advancing our country’s national interests.
This means we have to have an up-to-date knowl-

pt edge of the world and national situation, and of
the forces that are shaping this situation. That’s
Where the Communist Political Association comes-
in. For the CPA. is a political, educational or-
ganization devoted to helping its members un-
derstand events through the creative use of
Marxist political science.

    
 

 7 ” WHAT Is MARXHSM?

' Itpis “the application of science to the solution, P.
A -of political problems. It takes up such problems '

 _ » as particular points in the process of history as

F a whole, which it assumes follows certain princi-

ples of development, certain laws of motion,

which can be observed and charted and under-

~ stood. It sets itself the task, on the basis of such

an understanding of the principles of history,

better to equip mankind to control and guide

history-in-the-making today, which for us is made

up by" America’s decisions on our current na-

tional problems.” (Earl Browder, President of
the Communist Political Association.)

a In our day-to-day activities we need the "
clearer insight into political events, the deeper
understanding of our country’s national interests,
the ﬁrmer long-range perspective of social prog-
ress that we get from Marxism, and can get
from no other source. That is why we veterans
of this war belong to-the only American organi-
zation which consciously utilizes, and creatively
develops, Marxian political science—-The Com-

1 munist Political -Association.

WHY SHOULD PATRIOTIC AMERICANS TAKE.TH,E._ A
TROUBLE TO LEARN ABOUT oun_ ORGANIZATION}? if

' You notice we say “take the trouble,” for the\
average person does have to go to a bit of trouble;
to-learn the facts about American Communists
and their organization, the Communist P'olitical7
Association. The section of the general" press, ..
controlled by the Hearst-Patterson-McCormack 
axis makes a specialty of lying about Communists’,
and their policies, just as Hitler does within ‘Ger-~ ~
many and on a world scale. Unfortunately, the 
bulk of the rest of the press, does notyet see the »
need for answering this fascist propaganda tech-L xx
nique by honestly dealing with Communists and A
5 their views, and even on occasion itself indulges '
T in harmful misrepresentation. . . / C ” p
These lies and misrepresentations do not cause I ~ “ “
any irreparable harm to the Communist Political _
Association directly. Even in the face of ‘these  
slanders it grows and its views gain wider con- ,
sideration and acceptance. They do, however, do A V, 
irreparable harm to national unity and our ward if
effort. A  A L
Public confusion about Communists and their ’ 
policies is a chief asset of all forces in America 
who oppose our governn1ent’s war and peace
. policies. It is the smokescreen behind which these ’
: , forces operate most effectively.   ’

31  That is why we, as veterans of this war,fsay{‘
   that it is your, duty as a. patriotic American ‘tab
 it take the trouble to learn the facts about that
“Communist Political Association anclits policies} ‘

 
     

 

..,.,..,__,__»_t_....._.___......_

W e think that when you learn the facts about
our organization and its policies, you may want
to become a member. .

We know that irrespective of whether you ‘
decide to become a member or not, you will be
better able to form an intelligent opinion about
Communism as it is raised as an. issue in Ameri-
can political life, and therefore better able to
form intelligent opinions on all the major ques-
tions confronting our country.
