Tony Lennert, President of L0-

The 12 men involved were laid
off in December, 1953, and re-
ceived severance pay» at that

temporary work in July, 1954,
after the company got agree-
ment from a shop steward of
Local 813 that they would not
be paid severance pay if“ the
temporary job lasted less than
30 days.

Several of the local union of- '
ficers were on vacation at the

time, and the company used this
as an excuse for dealing with
the steward on the ‘question of

waiving the contract clause on ;

severance pay. -~ _

that the steward had no author-

your Union. It adds to the strength of your local, where-
ever you are, the strength of the other hundred thousand workers in our industry.

It’s a big job, running your Union, and an expensive job. We're more spread out
than most unions, but our per capita is lower than most. The cost of running your Union,
like everything else, is going up.

TIIE HISTOR-Y of Negroes on the railroads has been
.:a. history of exploitation on the part of the carriers and
suppression on the part of the Brotherhoods. The car-

ers always used them when they
could hire them for fractional per-
centages or substandard wages.”
The above quotation was taken
from a new p am p h l e t entitled
a“Lt=.-t‘-’“ Freedom Ride the Rails,”
ijssuedby the National Negro La-
bor Council. ‘

A nation’-wide m o v e m e n t is
Shaping up today to rid the rail-
roads of this shameful, undemo-
,'a'tic practice. It is necessary
that‘-the ‘entire labor movement,
inits own self interest, give full
support to. this movement. .. p _
r.Historically, Negro workers ' " -
have been conducting a struggle against these jimcrow
ractices on the railroads, fighting for higher wages, bet-
r working conditions, against being systematically elim-
inated from skilled positions which they had previously

carriers and the Brotherhoods.
c A _— Twin’ evils

_‘ HIS has been a figh.t, not alone against jimcrow prac-
tices in hiring, on-the—job training, upgrading into skilled
positions," for Negro‘ workers, but also against segregation
in traveling on the railroads. This twin evil is being
‘fought by the Negro people, and should receive the sup-
-‘port of all" democratic minded people, especially those in
‘ he labor movement. ' ,

De-segregation of public schools is the hottest issue in the South since Recon-, ,

'A wall came down i 
....morale went up

EL PASO, Texas—1955 will
be the second year of non-
segregated change rooms at
Southwest Pointlanld C e m e n 1:
here. A year ago, a wall was
torn down that had separated
Me.xican—American W 0 I‘ k e 1‘ I
from Anglos. It came as a bar-
gaining victory for Mine-Mill
Local 903.

Segregated change rooms had
been a long-standing grievance
of the Local union. Finally‘, in
1953 negotiations, the company
agreed to tear out the wall and
“try” the new waY- _

The wall had been more than
just wood and metal. It was
part of a policy of creating-
friction and ill-feeling between.
workers and the company.
Many grievances, had been
fought over job discrimination.

When the wall came down, a
lot of the old discrimination
went with it. Not that ‘every-.
thing is perfect I1_0“.’- but 79'
lationsare better in the plant,
and more Mexican-American
workers have been advancing to
more skilled jobs in accorchmco
withitheir seniority.

As a result of constant pres-
sure of the union, the attitrdo
of management has improved
over the years. For example, in

‘the recent negotiations the com-

pany representative, Mr. Koffc
man, insisted that at each of
the meetings the subject of
discrimination be on the agenda
so if there were any problems
they could be taken up.

It is clear to the members of
Local 903 that it pays to put up
a fight for the things you be-'
lieve in. . -

struction days, says Jesse Doster, Mine-Mill International Representative .in Georgia

and. South Carolina.

I

But while state officials and in s-ome cases anti-Negro white citizens are trying

Negro workers.

/

to whip up a terrorist atmosphere, he says, the Negro people in Georgia and South

Carolina are watching the situation without fear. This is especially true among;

Newspapers, radio and TV are working hard to whip up sentiment against the
Supreme Court ruling which outlawed segregation in the public schools. _ ~

“They have aggravated
this issue,” Doster says,

“to the point where it is as.

dangerous as a ‘keg of
dynamite. The Negroes
realize o-ne.t.hing—if the

The white trainmen will benefit from‘ this, because
itwill eliminate the basis upon which the company has
used one group of workers against another. ‘

, Jimcrow doesn't die easily

SUCII victories, following-the Supreme Court ruling on
de-segregation, are severe blows against jimcrow. But
theSouthern governors hold conferences where they plan
to perpetuate jimcrow, and stronger people's organiza-
tions are needed to continue the fight and win.

Jimcrow does not die easily. It is deeply rooted. It
has made wages "lower in the South; employers‘ don’t
readily give up lower wage scales. Many Northern plants
are running away from unions in the North by moving

to the jimcroiv South, with resulting pressure for wage_

cuts in the North.

Jimcrow is every worker's problem. -

One of the organizations involved in this fight is the

National Negro Labor Council. The pamphlet, mentioned

‘ above, contains valuable information on the subject and

should be read by all who are interested in helping in the

fight.

At our last Press Committee
meeting it was decided that we
should refrain from blasting any-
one in our Christmas issue, but
since the admonition on restraint
did not carry with it an order to
be a hypocrite, and since the com-
pany with their 28 issues to our
one hasn’t relented in the least
in their efforts to agitate’ and
divide us with their lies and
propaganda, even as we enter the
holiday season, 1 find it impos-
sible to wish the Company a

letting them know. that We kI10
what the score Is. ‘

"If I am guilty of lacking in the
holiday spirit perhaps'it’s partly
because of the atrocious conduct
and bad faith shown by the Com-

any in its conduct toward the

Things are certainly in a sorry
mess when it becomes necessary
to read the local (free?) press,
nottto find out what the truth 1s,
but to find outwhat lies are cur-

It'doesn’t strain the gray mat-
ter very much to suspect there
may be an underhanded motive in
repeating it so often for so long.

Hitler once wrote that if a lie
were told often enough, for long
enough, it will eventually be
accepted as fact. Perhaps in their
admiration of» Hitler’s methods
they are putting histheory to

‘ the test. ~

C[0’sireas0n for
expelling us ‘

When Mine-Mill was ousted

. from the.,CIO they said that com-

munism was not the issue but was
only being used as a means to an
end, that end being a proposition
to sell the Working people of the
entire nation down the river.

A That may have. sounded like a I

wild statement at the time, but in “

the light of what has transpired , . F '

since, maybe it wasn’t so wild.

Three men expelled
Mine-Mill ’

The charge of communism was
made against Mine-Mill by a com-
mittee of three men. The National
CIO Council acted on their recom-
mendations. These three men are
now THE HEADS OF UNIONS
WITHIN THE C10. THESE MEN

 I WHAT D of worker

does Kennecott want?
The exact picture of the

‘model work,er—-— as far as

Kennecott bosses are con-
cerner-— emerges from a

 careful study of the scor-

ing guide being used by the

_ . company in its tests of new
p ~ workers.

At a quick glance, you
see a worker who “keeps
his head down and his tail
up,”.works hard every min-
ute of his shift, obeys the

.foreman’s orders without

question, and took a job at
Kennecott because the
work looked interesting --‘
‘not because he needed the
money.

They're clever

The 13 tests are cleverly
devised. They never ask a
direct question. The test-
ing company which created
them is very frank about
this -—- in its confidential
memo to company officials.
It says workers won’t
answer a direct question

"about their intimate per-

sonal affairs. So the tests
give the worker a choice of
several answers to each
question”. .

For‘ example, Kennecott ‘
‘ isn’t so crude as to ask how

you get along with your

. wife. Instead it asks what

Choices 2 _married, single or

widowed, separated or di-
vorced.‘ Neat, huh?

Does he fit pal-fern?

But they go further than
-that. They score the.vari-
ous alternative answers. So
when a job applicant)
checks one of these choices-
which seem so simple and
innocent— he is actually
being tested to find out
whether he fits the pat-
tern for Kennecott’s ideal
worker.

These scores are obvious-
ly used to help decide
whether the worker is ‘to
be hired or not. Otherwise
why does Kennecott give
the tests? Yet the tests
deliberately deceive the
worker at the very. outset.
They say: “There are no
‘right’ answers to any ,,of
the questions. The ‘right’
answer is the one which
applies to you.” This is
bunk, as the scoring guide
shows that a certain
“weight” is given every
answer. There is a best
answer, a second best, a

‘third best and sot on.

aimof the tests is exposed

some kind of top-secret
government defense docu-
ment. I

Let's take a look at the
profile of wl1at Kennecott
considers a “model” work-

er——a.s shown by these’

tests.

He likes to work on a
piece work basis, rather

than at wage scales set by

union negotiations.

He works because Kenne-
cott offers such “interest-
ing” jobs, not because he
needs money to feed, clothe
and shelter his family

Doesn't like money

He wants to earn be-
tween $200 and $274 a

smonth. Any guy who dares

to hint he’d like more than
$375 a month scores a
goose egg when Kennecott’s
James Peterson grades his
test. ,

He has two children.
(Any worker with no kids
is too footloose to suit Ken-
necott).

He rents his living quart-
ers. His score goes down if
he owns his own house.

He has no beefs against
the companies or the fore-

men he worked under pre-. »

viously. »

He is NOT a “trouble-
maker.”

He has formed the
healthy habit of being
“loyal” to his foreman, his

STE. GENEVIEVE, Mo.——Al raid og-
the‘-National Labor Relations Board has
osgt the Mississippi, Lime Workers here
more than $60,000 in cash and their Mine-
Mill union. ‘
. l_For the record, the raiding was done
by‘the C10 Glass union. Actually, the
intimidation, stalling, threats and red-
baiting that finally beat Mine-Mill Local
883.. were carried on by agents of the
 N LRB. .
. Union-busting actions of NLRB agents ’
included the following: ‘ \
OT‘h-reW out an election last July 9 in
, which Mine-Mill beat the Glass faiders
j -by 364, to 92. This was done on com-
” plaint of a Glass supporter that he had
been pushed by a Mine-Mill man AFTER
the election was over.

E UNLRB then stalled five and one-half.
- months before holding a new election.
 All of this time the 480 workers were
" losing the benefit of a 10-cent-an-hour
raise they had negotiated before the
raid started. .  L
L ‘The NLRB got a court injunction for-
,».biding the officers of Local 883 from
”" carrying on any union activity.
Qln. order to get a new election at all,
_Local 883 was forced to sign‘ a stipula-
tion‘ “'admitting” acts which the local
unioh leaders say never occurred.

An NLRB director, Mr. McMahon, told.
. the leaders of Local 883 in a conference
that the local was “too militant” and

power to destroy that militancy! He
wasn’t fooling. » ‘

0 Mr. McMahon also told thecompany that
if he were managing the plant he would
fire every man who took part in a

. stoppage-—and that the NLRB would
uphold it.

0 McMahon told Henry Breig, Vice Presi-
dent of Local 883, that he ought tolead
the members of the local out of Mine-
Mill. ‘ A

O McMahon went to the home of another
local leader, Earl Sikes, and attempted
to question him “the way McCarran did

ewith our union leaders at Salt Lake.”
He asked all kinds of personal questions
and improper questions about the
gnion’s affairs, trying to intimidate
ikes. »— H

0 After the N LRB. hearing that preceded“

the election, McMahon made a speech,
telling the company and the raiders they
could do anything they pleased and it
would be all right with the NLRB.‘

. The NLRB succeeded in scaring and «
confusing enough workers so that Mine-.

Mill lost the December election by a nar-
row margin. The workers’ confidence in
the local leaders they had had with Mine-
Mill was_shoWn when they chose the same
leaders—-those who have always been loyal
to Mine'-Mill —— when" they re-organized
under the CIO Glass Workers.

It is edicted the local will be back in
Mine:-Mil , despite the NLRB.

A recent report of the House

“Farm Prices and the Cost of
Food,” points‘ out-c

Since 1951, peak prices re-
ceived by farmers- have fallen
20 points or almost back to
their 1946 level. In contrast, re-
ta.-il food prices now hold within
a fraction of their 1952 peak.

“Thus far, almost mum of the

The National Labor Relations Board, which in tho’ .
last two years has been more and more openly anti-union

is now showin
The Int’l

anti-Negro prejudices ‘as, well. ,
ongshoremen’s & Warehousemen’s Union

has charged the Board with acting in collusion, with”
Harry Lundberg’s Seafarer’s International.Union in a “

move to drive all Negro an

West Coast ships. ‘

d other minority workers off .

Late in November, the NLRB held‘hearings~ inSan , ,
Francisco to determine‘ the bargaining unit for stewards _’

on ships sailing from West

stewards have had their own

.._u'n_it. When the stewards went

into the IL‘\lV'l.‘3"l‘au3t-5‘4.~ar, it was

with theunderstanding that the »

union would fight to maintain
their right to_‘separate u_nits‘on

j board ship. ' /

However, the S\eafarer’sW Int.’l
Union and the Marine Firemen’s
Union demanded that the Board

set up a sing1e—unit election

aboard Pacific coast ships." The
ILWU pointed out that'suc_han
election would overwhelm the
stewards department workers by
the combined votes of AFL
sailors and engine room work-
ers. Only Iast_May, the stew-
ards overwhelmingly rejected
Lundberg’s' union by, _voting
1,287 to, 743 against it in an
NLRB election. The majority of
stewards aboard Pacific coast
vessels are Negro "or Oriental

, wonkers.

Now, however, the Board has
defied» its own precedentsjand
ordered a. single-unit election.

It did so after its hearing offi-.1

cer, Louis Penfield, barred from
the hearings all evidence of the
40-year-old policy of total dis-
crimination against Negroes
practiced by both the SIU_and
the Marine Firemen.

The .IL’WU Dispatcher, com-
menting. editorially, says ..“It is

44 STATE LEGISLATURES TO MEET

‘Right #05,: b'wi

_ A_series bf battles is shaping up in many of the 44
state legislatures convening in January. At issue will be
the mis-named -“Right to Work” laws,.which are actually

“right to scab” acts.

_ The American Federation of Laborihas launched
nationwide drive to repeal the phony right-to-exploit

laws which have been

passed in 17 states—-mostly the

deep South and Southwest. The AFL will also campaign
to block passage of similar laws in other states.

' Corporations lobbies, backed by local and state
Chambers of Commerce, have already opened their cam-
~paigns for passage of the phony open-shop bills in legisla-

tures of Colorado, Idaho, Mis-
-souri, Kansas and Maryland-—-

to name just a few states where A
there are Mine-Mill locals. The f...
employer drive, as usual with’

anti-union legislative campaigns,

sis amply heeled with funds for
publicity and advertising and——
11 some cases--palm greasing.

James P. ‘Mitchell,'“ Secretary
of Labor, attacked the phony
“tight to work” laws in a speech
before the CIO convention in
Los» Angeles recently. “I believe
that when employers and unions
representing a majority of their
employees agree on ‘union shop’
they ‘should have the right to
have one,” said Mitchell. The
“right to work” laws outlaw the
union shop and all other forms
of union security.‘

AT THE SAME TIME, it was
pointed out that Mitchell said
nothing about amending the
Taft-Hartley act or passing sep-
arate federal legislation which
would make all state “right to
work” laws illegal.

George Meany, President of
the AFL, says “The living stan-
dards of all Americans are ad-
versely affected by the passage
of this legislation.”

Contrary to the mis-leading
name given them by the employ-
ers,\“right to work” laws——

O Do NOT guarantee anyone a
job.

0 Do'NOT prevent anyone from
losing a fob.

. Q Do NOT help anyone to get a

job.‘ ,
0 Do NOT protectlanyone from

discrimination because of age, 1

race, color or union member-
ship.

Rather, these laws have one
m.ain purpose: to weaken union
organization so. wage rates can
be kept at a minimum.

IN NEVADA and other states
where these laws are on the
books, Mine-Mill has fought
them since they were first pro-
posed. Mine—Mill locals have
made it clear, time and again,
they stand ready to join with
any other organization that will
campaign for defeat or repeal
of “right to work” laws.

More buying power
needed. says NPA

WASHINGTON——The Na-
tional Planniﬁg Association
predicted I at the year’s end
that unemployment will rise
in 1955 and in following years
unless there is an increase in
consumer buying power as
well as industrial production.

To help boost national out-
put by $25,000,000,000 to
$30,000,000,000 next year, to
what it called a “r_easonably
full employment” level, N PA
recommended‘:

1. Further tax cuts, “par-
ticularly those affectingcon-T
sumption,” and improvement
of Social Security legislation.

2 A speedup of “badly
needed public undertakings,”
such as road, school and hos-
pital construction.

N eversowc-at Slim

By Cozy Dolun

NEVERSWEAT Slim dropped
into the office. At first I thought
he just came in to get warm
since he came up with the one
about it being colder than tur-
key-gravy the day after Christ-
mas. It appeared, however, that
he wanted to talk. Elizabeth
Ann, his ever lovin’, was at a
year-end sale and he didn’t.
want to spend his day, off alone.

He had the morning paper

and pointed to a story on’page,,

one about the National Planiiiﬂg
Association. This private, non-
profit organization was predict-

,’ ing that «un-em-ploynient will in-

creﬁse in 1955 and thereafter
unless government and industry
act to increase consumer buying
power and industrial production.

“The guts of this report,” Slim
“is the part about us
needin’ to increase the people’s
buying power. So what does
the Montana Standard say in its
headline? ‘More Production is
Required in U.S. Says N.P.A.’
And tlrat’s the difference be-
tween what the story really says
and the philosophy of the com-
pany-—the company which owns
the Montana Standard.”

I stopped pretending I was
working and settled back to
hear Slim finish his point. He
borrowed -some of my tobacco,
unzipped his plaid jacket, and

i~ made like Will Rogers at a

mountain oyster fry. 3
“Buster,” he said, “these so-
called brilliant industrialists
who ’hire usipoor slobs to mine
their bloody ore and work in

. their b l o o d y factories either

don’t- know. what's good for
America or they’re too bloody
greedy to care. Suppose you
and I, Buster, are not against
increasing production. It might
be fine and dandy to increase
p1'oduct’io\n--providin’ it made
more and more jobs and the peo-
ple who ARE working can im-
prove their livin’ standards.

Whenever a boss_ Vthinksabout »

increasin’ production though, he
usually thinks first about
speedin’ up the workers and
about increasin’ their pay last."”

Slim showed me some quotes
from the NPA annual report.
Its most important point, which
the NPA stressed time and
again was that “the need for

Tax on buying power 

If a single person were to re-
ceive the same tax-exempt buy-
ing power today as he did in
1939 he would have an exemp-
tion of $1920 instead of $600.
A married couple would have a
$4800 exemption instead of
$1200.  '

purchasing power to rise simul-
taneously with productive capa-
city is one of the crucial prob-
lems of economic growth.”

-Among other things the NPA

judged “the most important to
be a rise in wage rates and a
reduction in prices in accord
with increases in productivity.”
I reminded Slim that this is‘
what Mine-Mill had been saying
for many years now.

. . 1'
“Of course,” he agreed, “I

players and some of those jerks
in Washington say Mine-Mill’s
program is an un-American pro-
gram-—-one that is dictated by a
foreign power. What a crock of
gliie that is! The truth is, Bus.
ter, that a lot of people who
thought Mine-Mill was plannin’
a revolution six or seven years A
ago are now sayin’ the same
things. They’re ]'list*"sayin’ ’em
latter, that’s all.

“Now you take Travis’ indict-
ment. The bosses and the Eisen-
hower administration say that
Travis brought the ‘party’ line
into the union. They say his
actions and the things he’s said

L prove that he lied when he said

he wasn’t a member of the
Communist party. They point to
Mine-Mill policies and state-
ments as their ‘proof.’

“Now it's true that the Com-.
munist Party has said that we
must increase the people’sibuy-
ing power. Since. Travis has
said the same thing they're now
tryin’ to say’ that ‘See! He’s

Hewiff feaching
in public school

 VANCOUVER, B. C. -— John

Hewitt, who left his teaching
position at the Shawnigan Lake
Boys’ School ‘on Vancouver
Island because racist directors
of the swank private school ob-
jected to the presence of _his
wife Dorothy on the campus on
account of- her mixed racial ori-
gin, is now on the public school
staff of the municipality of
Burnaby, a large suburb of Van-
couver.

ballot box was moved from
plant to plant during an entire
monthiin order to build up the
vote.

ALSO STRANGE to adher-
ents of democracy was the an-
nual “convention” of Local 1-71
(the loggers’ local). This took
place December 20, and replaced
the old-established g e n e r a 1
meeting of the local, formerly
held while the loggers were in
town for Christmas, and open
to all paid-up members.

The new “anti-red” leadership
of the local had abolished this
democratic tradition, and sub-
stituted a system of delegates
from the camps, always care-
fully screened by the exetcutive,
which means that no general
meeting of the local is ever
held.

BUT THIS YEAR, for the
first time, the executive openly
explained the change, in re-
sponse to a resolution from one
camp that the old system should
be resumed. _ I

A spokesman said that if
open membership meetings were
held, “pressure political groups
might get control”!

Despite rigid control of the
convention, the loggers succeed-
ed in reproving the District Ex-
ecutive, controlled by millmen,
in a resolution which called for
separate negotiations for their
local.

.9

“The 1954-1955 ( o v e r a ll )
IWA
against loggers in that it.~broke
the board clause and imposed
conditions that excluded many
from paid statutory holidays”,
resolved the delegates.

The resolution continued:
“This local is of the opinion
that contract settlements made

mental to the overall wellbeing»

of the union”, and, “that we
keep in mind the possibility of
withdrawing from industry-
wide bargaining so our contract
needs and requirements can re-
‘ceive proper consideration”.

THIS RESOLUTION would
-indicate that it is fear of the
voice of the membership, rather
than precaution against “pres-
sure group,” which prompts the
leadership of the IWA to ad-
here so stubbornly to their del-
egate convention formula for
Local 1-71. T

MINERS REJECT COMPULSORY BONUS

SALMO, B. C. —- “Compul-
sory” bonuses from the Canadi-
an Exploration ‘Company here
have been firmly rebuffed by
the recent action of the contract
miners themselves, members of
Nelson Local 901.

The company has been in the
habit‘ of paying contract .bo-
nuses whether or not the local
c o n t r a c t committee had ap-
proved the contracts. The min-
ers realized this‘was designed
to undermine the contract com-
mittee which they had fought
to establish, and at a meeting
December 5, decided that all
money paid on contracts not

Lochl 98 helps
UAW strikers

SUDBURY, Ont.—In a ges-
ture of solidarity with the Ford
strikers, the members of Local
598 voted to donate $1,000 to
help their brothers of the UAW.
on the picket line.

The action was taken after an
appeal made by Herman Swan-
son, Vice-President of Local
200, UAW, and by picket cap-
tain Frank Harris of Windsor,
at Mine-Mill meetings.

The two UAW representa-
tives spoke at

Ford strike as a challenge to
the whole labor movement in
Canada.

In introducing the UAW rep-
resentatives, Vice-P r e si d e n t
Wm. Sproule said it has al-
ways been the policy of Mine-
Mill to strive for greater unity
and understanding in the labor
movement. He added that pres-
ent conditions call for such la-
bor unity, if labor organizations
in Canada are to maintain their
gains and set back the attacks --
of big business.

es ite demands from the trade unions that the
a overnment take steps to remedy the rapidly
" iorating-«employment picture, the government offi-

delegations was that the devel-
opment of Canada's northern
mineral resources would take
care of the situation. This ‘is
contradicted by a recent warn-
ing from the government’s na-
tural resources department who
urged that job seekers should
stay away from the northern
developments, as unemployment
in these areas this winter was
a possibility.

The department no doubt had
in mind situations such as ex-
isted last winter at Uranium
City, where large numbers of
miners were stranded without
jobs in this northern mining
community. ‘

Paralleling the increase in
unemployed is the rise in divi-
dends payments. These reached
an all time high in 1954 with a
total of $570,288,654 an in-
crease of 6.3% over 1953. Divi-
dend payments do not reflect
total profits as it is customary
for most corporations to retain
a major share of the profits in
Corporation reserves. '

With his eye on the dividend
picture, rather than the unem-

ployment situation, B. S. Vans- »

tone, President of the Bank of
Toronto stated: “1955 can be a
year of mode1‘ate but well sus-
tained prosperity for Canada.”

Trade union spokesmen how-
ever pointed out that a bleak
winter faced thousands of Ca-
nadian workers and their fain-
ilies, with an expected total of
% million unemployed this win-
ter or one in every eight of the
total working force.
