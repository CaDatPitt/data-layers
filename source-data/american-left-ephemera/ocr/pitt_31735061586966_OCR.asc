To The Mill Hunk Herald.

You said your next issue was
about the solutions to_ being

unemployed. I keep thinking about,!

the pain of it, and how everyone
survives it in such different ways,
how a marriage can survive all that
tension, yet it's the friends, the
softball games, the radio in the

»afternoon that gets us all through

it. Because idespite the men that
have left when it got to be too

much, the kids who won‘t.have shoes, d V

in the Fall jfor school, the tv and

the 'fan running despite_the electric,

bills. --~we’ make it because we
still, know we are right. and

rightness doesn't pay the bills, butyee

it makes the screams so strong and

clear, it makes any meaning mean '
more. My mother is afraid that I may;
end up like she did, with welfare,.

and 3 baby girls to support, and-I
used- to think, no, it can't happen
again and again. I saw her through

.the worst of times, and now she sees

me, trying to get through, ‘with

ysmall 'dreams_ that, get smaller with

each ,bill I can't pay. I say, Mom,
‘here: _we go, _andy things haven't

‘changed much, but I‘ now what this

is, I ,know how’ to fight better, 1

‘know where to ‘go when I just can't

take "it from them anymore. I tell
her I don't see an end to it, I

”_don't know what will happen, if I'll
‘ still haved something in me that
‘keeps fighting, but if we keep

ewriting, keep making it mean what it

h_is, and let it be what it is, not

us, not our worn out dreams---we'll

_ keep passing that extra $5 we don't

have yaround ;to the right hands, and

V ‘our knowing will be -enough. Worn
hfaces can‘ stare down any late night
tv, and ’we can't afford to fix the

car, and we will live on this jar of
peanut ‘butter and we're worn, but
keeping our feet on the ground. It's

,still ours."

_for me, and for how we keep going.

Ww'I'2qpgu-‘V

Last February my father died

land all of this became apparent to

me. My mother died in 1980. with no
brothers or sisters I find myself
now very much alone. The desire to

‘settle down, to have some on-going

companionship and-something which is
really mine, has been growing

steadily since my father's death. We‘

weren't very close but I learned a
great deal from him anyway and it is
just now that. I'm beginning to
realize how much alike we were.

Many Hunk readers probably felt
the same ambiguities I did during
the '60's and early '70's. We grew
up5 in a work-and-live-with-two-fists
atmosphere and we rejected a lot of
that in favor of political causes
and lifestyles which pulled us from
our families. Now, however, I find
myself using the logic and good
sense I learned from my parents.
It's a fact of life that I have to
work in order to live. It is only
the occasional pride which I am able
to feel from a job well done and the
"simple pleasures" which go with
this pride that makes working
worthwhile and life interesting. Ten
years ago I didn't see it that way.

-the center of

.1 went to high‘ school in a
small Pennsylvania town. They beat
us and
opportunity and‘ the only things we
learned were shop and muscle
building so that we could go into
the army or into the —factory. I
stayed small and rebellious ‘and I
refused to register for the draft.
The KKK was active there and it only

made bad situations worse. ‘ There
was a suicide club in my high school
that petered out when almost

everyone in it was killed in car
wrecks. I was happy to leave that
behind me.

In April I .had «to go back to
Pennsylvania in order to straighten
out my dad's will. I decided to turn
a business trip into rest and
relaxation and so my partner and I
travelled‘ around the g state for
almost two weeks checking out places
we remembered from our youth and
wondering if we could live in
Pennsylvania again. I decided that I
could and I want to tell you why.

My mother grew up in
Philadelphia ’and worked in the mills
there until she became Q teacher.
Her old neighborhood is even more of
a ghetto now than it was when she
was" a kid and most of the mills are

closed. .My mother died at age,

fifty-three, her life probably cut
short by hard work, and by the
isolation she felt living in a small
town. She’ is lucky, I think, to be
buried near her- birthplace but far

'from the mills.

My ‘father was not so lucky. He
grew up in Hazleton, which was once
Pennsylvania's
anthracite and beryllium production.
"Urban renewal" came along in the
early '60's and knocked down his
cozy old neighborhood, replacing it
with "public housing" which remains
largely empty to this day. His
parents moved to Florida and my
grandmother died soon after. He
moved down in August and died in
February. For all of his work he now
has only the six feet of sand

coralled us at every,

covering him--so different than the
cool slag of central Pennsylvania!

"All that I have I ‘owe to their work and to
the survival skills they taught me.”

Still, Hazleton I and
Philadelphia mean a lot to me. My
miner uncles, my weave I room

grandparents and aunts, my factory
worker and teacher parents and my
transient friends helped build those
cities. A miner's cemetery _near
Weston tells the story better: at
least a dozen relatives of mine are
buried there, the graves set on a
hill overlooking .a beautiful valley
blemished by la few strip mines. All
that I have I owe to their work and
to. the survival skills they taught
me.

Our trip» back began with a bad
start. we had a small fire in the
house we rent the night before we
left. After that, at about five in
the morning, a local street person
called and tried to hustle me out of
two‘ hundred dollars. The car lost
its engine in Ohio and we spent four
days crashing with a family of
laid-off steel workers turned
mechanics and truck drivers in
MacDonald, Ohio, waiting for parts.

Once we made it to Pennsylvania

everything went well. I visited my .

old home, my companion checked out
some _schools she's interested in and
we did some visiting. I saw.a great
aunt of mine who lives in’a patch
town just ‘outside of Hazleton. It
was my visit with her which
convinced me to move back to
Pennsylvania, to reexamine the

‘places and values I grew up with.

My aunt has lived in that patch
town all of her life. She lives
across the street from the house she
was born in and next door to a
brother she hasn't spoken to since
the '40's. The town is still Polish
and Italian, reflecting the

segregation by nationality which the
coal companies used so effectively
in years past.‘ She told me that the
local mine has reopened and that it
is managed by people who know next
to nothing about mining and owned by
a corporation no one there has ever
heard of. The discriminatory hiring
policies the new owners sought to
institute fell apart when some local
kids burned down a mine office. They
may. have even taken a few shots at
coal trucks and stolen some weapons.
What is clear at this point is that
some of the kids have been caught,
that many of the stolen weapons have
not« been recovered and that the kids
will get railroaded. The old Molly

‘ Maguires must be laughing in their

graves: the arrested kids all have
Irish‘ names so, in one ,form or
another, the Mollys have made it
into the twentieth century. "God
bless them!" is the most common
local reaction. ‘

‘My ’aunt ‘ said, "we're just
hunks. You always loved the mines."
I hit my tongue. ‘I wanted to say,
"we're not ‘just hunks‘ and I only
loved the mines because I loved the
men who worked in them and the women
who stood with them and the kids who
grew up around it all!" But I bit my
tongue. I wanted to yell about how

”I’ll remember you all for as long as I live.
What was done to you was far worse than
what you did to each other.” '

the '60's pulled us apart and about
how people can find their way back.
But I bit my tongue.

I , could .not contain myself,
however, at the Weston cemetery. The
tombstones are in Polish or Italian.
The Italian stones have photographs
of the deceased -stuck vinto. the
-cement \so that I know« what my
great-grandparents looked like. It
is quite a feeling, but I wonder why
such quiet cemeteries gand such
detailed photographs caught ’ the
interest of the old Italian miners.

11‘ It is such a contrast to the stuffy

, l ,. ...w.;.uaa-mmu¢..‘ ..  %

«4

mines and the noisy homes and patch
towns. It helps you remember and
think.

well, I "remember" anyway.
Perhaps I "remember" even better
than my dead miner uncles ,and
greategrandparents because I »can
contrast the results of their lives
and work with the transience of the
'60's and '70's. We haven't gained

.very much. Out loud, with only the

graves and the birds to hear me, I
said to the graves, "I'll remember
you all for as long as I live. What
was done to you was far worse than
what you did to_ one. another.” I
cried a little,‘ took some
photographs and left. I, promised
myself that ‘I'd try, again, to make
the ‘kind of mark on the world that
they did and that if I ever have
kids I'll take-them to that cemetery
and to those mines so that they can
have a sense of their beginnings.

You see, the old miners really
asked for very little and they got
even less.- We're asking for even

 

less today, really, and we don't

‘have the kind of communities and

solidarity that the old miners could
take a little pride in. If we let
what little we have left go then not
only have we lost a class struggle,
we've also lost our right to think
of our miner and steel worker
forefathers as ancestors and
relatives. Not wanting to be any
more cut off from .my past than I
already am I resolved to settle down
and try to make some changes in the
world. '

Maybe that's corny. Maybe I'm
just a twenty-seven year old drifter
with no family and no future. Maybe
that's all I'll ever be. I'd trade
it all at this point for a family
and a home and a union card that
means something. But if all I ever
have is "memories" of times I didn't
live through and an ache in my heart
for all that I've missed, I'll still
have more than I would on a cold day
when I have no coat and no place to
live~ and a ride going west. The fall
will find me in Pennsylvania trying
to work it all out.

FACTORY FLIGHT
STEELWORKER SOLUTIONS

Crossing the Homestead
High-Level bridge across the
Monongahela kRiver from Pittsburgh

into Homestead, one is struck by the
awesome sight of
Steel factory lining the river bank
as far as one can see. This is where
the masters of steel _in 1892 --
Andrew Carnegie and his partner
Henry Clay _Frick -- . defeated
striking workers of the Amalgamated
Association of Iron and Steel Makers
in a bitter, deadly struggle, which
essentially crushed worker revolt in
the steel industry until ’the '30s
when steel companies finally
recognized. the legal organizing
rights of workers.

Homestead is a microcosm of
smokestack America, big steel, saga
of immigrant toil. If the world were
a factory, then Homestead, and
nearby Mon Valley mill towns like

Duquesne, Braddock and
McKeesport would be the blast
furnaces. Or so it seemed.

with more power than Carnegie

- or Frick could ever muster, an
elusive enemy has devastated this
gritty arena of human endeavor.
While Carnegie and Frick threatened
the livelihood of individuals, this
newer enemy threatens the survival

region. Steelworkers,
in Carnegie and Frick's time, had
concrete objects of scorn; even the
names -- Carnegie and Frick -- were
direct, like steelmaking. But
the new enemy is shadowy and
indirect in its methods. Even the
name -- disinvestment -- is soft and
murky. How can an unemployed worker
even begin to fathom what
disinvestment looks" like? Frick was
gruff and bearded, Carnegie a dapper
little Scotsman. Disinvestment?

Silent, rusting steel
factories, shuttered store fronts

.and .the wasted lives of thousands of
idle people, however, provide stark

testimony to i the’ power of
disinvestment. But you can't
assassinate ' disinvestment like
Alexander Berkman,. the young
anarchist, tried against Frick
.during the ‘ five-month Homestead
strike. Disinvestment hasn't even
left a‘ library in its wake like
Carnegie.

PROPERTY VALUES

(for Chuck)

Driving down South Linden Avenue,
‘Where I nibbled at the lower edge
Of the upper crust,

I am drawn back to Berkman,

His rusted saturday night special
Leveled at the capitalist Frick.

Property values quivered when Henry Clay
Moved to this neighborhood. V

Values contrive an implacable rise today
And you talk of buying a 3 unit bldg. T

Before he disarmed the anarchist
Frick took at least one in the neck
But he worked on, oblivious as ever.

Don't be misled, _

When the anarchist comes in the window,
Special in hand, ’

It'll be your neck his liberty again

And you'll still be stuck with a capital gain.'

How do displaced workers fight
back against something as nebulous
as disinvestment? This phenomenon
derives its alarming power from
corporate investment _policy that
starves ’factories of needed money to
keep them healthy. Two grassroots
organizations, the Tri-State
Conference on Steel and the
Denominational Ministry Strategy,

actively pursue strategies designed
to resist further plant closings in

the. Pittsburgh area. They are
attempting to assert greater worker
and community control over

investment policy in the Mon Valley.

eminent domain. _

The legality of the strategy’is>

not a major problem, according to
attorney Jay Hornak, who is working
closely with Tri-State on the
eminent domain issue. "The real
problems are the enormous political
and financial obstacles," Hornak
/said. ‘

These financial and political
problems are indeed awesome. Worker
and community apathy is a tremendous
difficulty.

"I get disgusted with the rank

'n' file because they never help us
in demonstrations, rarely come to
meetings," says fiery Ron Weisen,
president of USWA_ Local 1397,
located in Homestead, and known for
its militancy, at least among its
leadership. "In fact, there's little
hope of getting the rank 'n' file
behind Tri-State. The rank 'n' file
has become fat and complacent." He
says many union members have little
understanding of the struggles that
took place between workers -and
management in the steel industry
that created the. wage and benefits
so often criticized as excessive.

says.

The hopelessness and
complacency stems from the belief
that workers are ‘somehow at fault
for their unemployment, warfield
says. "we're working to convince
workers that they are not
responsible for their unemployment;
steel companies make their
disinvestment decisions regardless
of their wages and benefits."

Tri-State leaders agree that
education of workers is fundamental
to having them understand the true
nature of the current crisis, which
is the insidious process of steel
companies diverting steel profits to
other economic sectors like
chemicals, oil and real estate,
while little of the profits from
steel making is fed back into the
steel. plants, creating. industrial
atrophy. Mon Valley steel plants are
simply outdated. -Disinvestment has
not suddenly appeared, instead it
has vbeen taking place for years,

primarily since WWII, and now it~

threatens the very survival of the
Mon Valley mill towns.

Tri-State~ leaders say they also
face strong resistance from the
leaders of the USWA International.
They say this hinders their effort
to organize the necessary political
and financial clout to make eminent
domain a viable strategy.

"He should be throwing his arms
around Tri-State, yet he's fighting

their « efforts to stop '
« disinvestment," Frank O'Brien said,

referring to. Lloyd McBride, PUSWA
International president. O'Brien is
a retired steelworker and he was
president ’of Local 1843 in.Hazelwood
from 1958 to 1970. Hazelwood is a
decaying section of Pittsburgh on
the Monongahela River between
Homestead and downtown Pittsburgh.

. "The International has never

 

''All power to the board of directors!”

protected the workers. It's always
been that way since I've been a
member (since 1945).. My biggest
problem has been fighting the
International," O'Brien said. We sit
in _his home, a modest, one-story
brick structure up the hill from the
still operating Hazelwood Jones .&
Laughlin steel factory: the gray
smoke pouring into the air above the
black factory buildings is a
.reminder of the Mon Valley's former

, industrial might. Despite years of

internecine‘ struggle within the
USWA, O'Brien still does not
understand why there is persistent
conflict 'between the union hierarchy
and the ‘rank 'n' file. "It baffles
me.f Maybe they're (International
union leaders) controlled by the
corporations."

weisen, in his office at the
Local 1397 building just across the
railroad tracks from the rusting,
monstrous and idle open hearth
section ,of the Homestead factory, is
more colorful in his resentment
toward the International.

 

V "The executive board (of the
USWA) always blames
Ronald) Reagan, but they never take
on the corporations. It's a goddam
shame; they've been in bed with the
companies for so long they should
file for maternity benefits. McBride
has lost touch with his members. The
workers will start paying attention
to us, the grassroots, because they

‘see the union being »sold down the

river by the International," Weisen
said while sitting) at his desk.
Behind him, the wall is plastered
with bumper stickers. "Going Hungry?
Eat Your Datsun!" says one. Another
expresses solidarity with the Polish
worker's movement.

In a comfortable,’ carpeted,
tenth~ floor office in the downtown
Pittsburgh USWA International
headquarters, which provides a
striking view of the Monongahela,

Allegheny and Ohio Rivers‘
confluence, James Smith, assistant
to Lloyd McBride and acting director
of research, speaks softly and
deliberately. ~ A

"People get frustrated and

(Presidents

bitter when they are laid off, and,

they have a tendency to strike out
at anybody and everybody," Smith

says in reference to rank 'n' file‘

hostility. "Some people expect the
union to do things beyond the realm

'of possibility. How do you strike to

keep plants from being'shut down? As
far as ‘demonstrating, the only real
gain is it would show that there is
a problem.

'"An alternative to keeping. a

"It's a phony issue," says Gary

referring derisively to eminent

in-house publication. "It raises

false hopes for the community. It's
an idealistic approach to save jobs,
but it takes enormous amounts of
money and communities cannot come up
with the necessary capital," Hubbard
said.

Attracting ~ the necessary
finances is a third major problem
confronting Tri-State in its attempt
to establish eminent domain as a job
saving strategy. Tri-State leaders
assert that gaining massive federal
aid is the ideal funding mechanism
for eminent domain, primarily

because of the gigantic
modernization costs (which private
lending sources "probably would

avoid, given the relatively low rate
of return in the steel industry),
plus public monies allow for more

democratic participation in plant
operations: workplace democracy is a
fundamental thrust of Tri-State
strategy. Stout stresses that any
federal money should ideally be
controlled at the local level by
democratically governed

investment-decision boards.

Other funding mechanisms,
according to attorneyl Hornak, are
less desirable because of a reliance
on private lending sources, and,
hence, less of a chance for
democratic decision-making. One
option is to rely on traditional
lending sources such as banks, and
savings and loans “associations,
Hornak said. The public authority

created to invoke eminent _domain

could also issue tax exempt bonds.
Hornak says this is a risky
alternative because. of a potential
difficulty in finding buyers.
Another choice is_to simply find one
buyer for the closed plant.

A final option, according to
Hornak, is to somehow gain access to
worker pension money, which could be
invested to keep plants open.

An attempt to realize eminent
domain recently failed in the
borough of west Homestead. The
borough Council voted 4-3 to create
the public authority in order for it
to invoke eminent domain over the
closed Mesta Machine Company, once a
maker of machinery for the steel
industry. However, Mayor John Dindak
vetoed that ordinance. He argues
that taking over Mesta could lead to
financial L difficulty for W.
Homestead. Dindak says the primary
reason for his veto, however, is
because he believed the majority of
W. Homestead citizens were simply
leery of eminent domain.

"It ’scared too many citizens
not knowing what ,would happen (if
eminent domain) were invoked. I'm
not hostile to the group's
initiatives; it's just that it is
such a, farfetched idea." Dindak
argues that mores education _of the
public is' needed and’ suggested to
borough Council that the issue be
subject to a referendum vote in the
Novemberaelections.

Hornak verified Dindak's claim
that ‘w. Homestead citizens are not
yet passionately supportive of
eminent domain as a means to resist
further job loss. "It is extremely
difficult to y get a
interested. Homestead people don't
want to deal with it in a realistic
fashion. I‘ guess it's (Mesta's
shutdown) too traumatic for them to

really face the situation," Hornak.

said.

 

communityi

The young attorney
refuted 'Dindak's claim that eminent
domain would have posed financial
problems for w. Homestead. "There's
absolutely no validity to his
argument that eminent domain could
bankrupt W. Homestead. It would only
cost the borough $150 in legal fees.
Tri-States has always said that there
must be~ an independent source of

‘financing;' we would never rely on

the taxpayers."

Allegheny County would probably
not adopt eminent domain as a job
saving .strategy, according to Tom
Foerster, chairman of the Allegheny

County _ Commissioners.» "Allegheny
County could never ‘acquire pby
condemnation existing industrial

facilities because it is not big
enough financially: taxpayers would
go down Jthe drain. '1 don't know

don't think it will work. It can't
be done without deep federal and
state government involvement because
of their broad base taxing powers."
Foerster said the County
Commissioners‘ might
eminent domain plan if a buyer of an
industrial property were immediately
available.

Pittsburgh City Council
discussed the option of eminent
domain when the Nabisco Company
threatened to shut its Pittsburgh
plant last winter (Nabisco later
relented and’ kept the factory open)
but since then has not considered it
a. primary job saving strategy,
according to Council member Ben
woods. ' '

Another grassroots organization
attempting to resist the terrifying
impact of disinvestment is a
coalition" of ministers from five
denominations. The’ organization,
named the Denominational Mission
Strategy, is organizing an ongoing
boycott of Mellon ’ Bank. DMS
criticizes the
policies, arguing that they create
long-term unemployment in the Mon
Valley.

Rev. James von Dreel, a DMS
leader, says the banks hold the key
to economic development in the Mon
Valley and therefore workers and
communities must gain financial
leverage over the banks to "maintain
the dignity of having a job."

Mellon Bank "is a primary
disinvestment culprit, DMS contends,
because of considerable loans it has
made to foreign steel interests,
including Sumitomo Industries of
Japan, a Mesta competitor: Sumitomo
sold a continuous caster to J&L's
Indiana Harbor, Ohio, plant; Mellon
is the top J&L shareholder with
2,472,000 shares, according to DMS.
"The steel industry hasn't
enjoyed a reasonable return on
investments for 50 years," said
David Barnes, chief executive of

support an

bank's investment—

22

Mellon, the 14th largest bank in the
country. Thus, Mellon will probably
continue. to make investments where
it perceives the .highest ,rate of
return is to be found.

"The thinking of bankers must
be turned around," O'Brien said.
"You can't have 18 to 20 percent
margins and expect to compete on the
world .steel market.” Banks, he said,
will have to realize that a smaller
profit margin of about four percent
is more feasible. "1 think the
bankers thinking can be turned
around," perhaps through arm twisting
like a bank boycott,” O'Brien said.

The‘ principal focus of the DMS
bank boycott campaign is to
disparage the "neighbor you can
count on" advertising slogan of

Mellon.

 

V "A bank lives by its image, and
it V will lose money if people
perceive it to be not so good," Von
Dreel said.

DMS gained national attention
when it focused its efforts on the
Mesta shutdown and in particular
Mellon's withholding of back pay for
some Mesta employees. Eventually,
Mellon released the money after
Mesta filed for bankruptcy, which
Mellon said was legally necessary
for it to release 'the money.
Nonetheless,' DMS is’ primarily
concerned about the long-term impact
of disinvestment on the Mon Valley
and the bank's role in that process.

-investment‘

Indeed,
unanimous

there seems to be
support among those
interviewed in local government, the
USWA International and grassroots
activists on the notion that pension
fund money should be invested in the
region to boost economic activity.
But none .of the ‘leaders, with the
exception of the USWA International,
outlined a concrete plan to assert
control over the funds, in order to
the influence of investment
who are bound by narrow
rules which limit
expenditures to where the highest
yield is supposedly derived.

managers

"The ‘problem with pension funds
is that. the .investors feel obliged
to -be conservative, which means they
are reluctant to make loans that are
speculative," says acting USWA
Research Director Smith. "The only
way to free up monies is if the
government, guarantees backing sup
certain percentages of the loan,
otherwise you're not going to get a
large participation from pension
fund administrators (in spending
money for domestic manufacturing)."

The USWA therefore supports the
idea (also endorsed by the AFL-CIO)
of directing a certain percentage of
private pension money to a federal
Refinancing Development Corporation,

»which would then direct the mohey‘to

domestic manufacturing needs,
according ’ to Russell Gibbons,
director of, the USWA Communications
Department.

Stimulating worker
stock-ownership is yet another
mechanism to resist disinvestment.
Desperate workers at Weirton Steel
in weirton, W. Va., not far from
Pittsburgh, opted for this plan to
resist a drastic production cutback
threatened by National Steel. The
weirton employees are attempting to

save their jobs and community by

ﬁcreating an Employee Stock Ownership

Plan (ESOP).

25

_ ESOPs‘ are created when la
financial trust t is ‘formed, with
banks making ‘loans to the trust,
which in turn buys company stock.
The company then makes payments to
the trust to reduce the debt, and,

as the lenders are repaid, the/trust

allocates stock to employees. The
Weirton workers took a 32 percent
cut in wages and benefits, 12
percent of which is to create an
equity base to help attract
financing, to go toward the $181

million purchasing price. Supporters
say ESOPs provide tax.advantages to
lenders and give workers economic
stakes in their companies.

”Work‘er-buyouts have usually involved
stringent covenants with banks, with worker-
managers having no more maneuvering room
than the previous boss.”

Critics, however, say ESOPS do
not connect worker ownership with
worker control, primarily because of
the reliance on outside financial
interests to make the plan succeed,
at least initially. For instance,
the ESOP board of directors at
weirton Steel has ten members, six
of which are appointed by the
company's legal and financial
directors, plus the company lenders.
ESOP critics also assert ‘that
workers, are forced to adopt this
strategy simply as a .way to save
their jobs.

/,

The Wall Street Journal agreed

in a recent editorial that
legitimate worker control under an
ESOP is generally absent: "As
workers become shareholders," it
wrote, "particularly of near
bankrupt companies, they can easily

be H discouraged by the unexpected
risks and constraints of ownership;
in particular, worker-buyouts have
usually involved stringent covenants
with banks,’ with worker-managers
having no more maneuvering room than
the previous boss."

FROM STEEL CITY TO SCRAP TOWN

The overall USWA approach,
according to Steelabor Managingi
Editor Hubbard, is to work within a
so*called tripartite framework in
which it cooperates with management
and government to derive, for
example, a consensus for a job’
saving program. The USWA policy to
resist rampant plant closings, then,
is to gain victories in the courts
and political arena, plus at the
collective bargaining ‘table --
certainly a traditional approach to
solve steel worker problems. The
International specifically, for
example, is vigorously working to
influence international trade
procedures in order to save domestic
steel jobs, while bargaining for"
more stringent plant closure
notification provisions that
essentially would make it more
_expensive for companies to shut down

and pension liabilities, according
to Hubbard.

Workers have always told jokes,
directed ‘at each bother, T their
families, and the boss. Many are
cruel, many good natured, and a lot
of them ribald. But they have an
inner logic that tells us something
very often. For instance, here's a
joke_ that must go back centuries.
Two lords (or businessmen) decide to
reward their workers for long
service at‘ low pay by inviting them
out to the country estates for the
weekend. On Monday morning the two
meet. "Some advice you gave me!" the
first one shouts. "Chewing gum in my
curtains! Rubbers they threw in.my
chandeliers! Pages of expensive

books they tore out to wipe their-

asses on!" "You're complaining!"
says the other, "Forty acres of
wheat I own, prime golden

g had gone as far as they could with
the beliefs and illusions that
carried white settlers from Europe
to the New world. When they found
themselves desperately poor, their
dreams smashed, even the kind of
social safeguards that European
societies had created- flushed away
by the brutal American corporate
power--private armies used against
workers in simple strike situations,
unionists kidnapped by the
State--they , experienced a
disillusionment both massive and
extreme. Lone men in extractive
industries, agriculture and
sea-faring, "timberwolves,
"bindle-stiffs," they lived on the
roads. Employers treated them like
animals--filthy living quarters, bad

food,- lies to recruit and threats to
A keep them. But they had real dreams

and aspirations. When the I.w.W.'
spoke about a new morality,

The same dry wit became a major
tactic in the "Socialist" agitation
that ‘grew with the movement in the
mining towns and industrial villages
in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma along
with parts of the South. There, the
monthly National Rip-Saw based in
St. Louis had a special influence on
most of its 50,000 circulation.
Henry M. Tichenor, one of Missouri's
earliest notable poets, editor of an
anti-church (but_not anti-religious)
magazine, The Melting Pot, and humor
columnist for the Rip-Saw, became
famous for his labor poems:

The triumph of the "Communists"
was to prepare the labor movement
for a _
unionism. And for that

Communist agitation helped produce
.many la union, humorist in the
19305-40s. "Uncle Sam" Liptzin,
jokester» of the tailor's union in

New York, wrote lines like these:

,- Business can be managed well by
the telephone, for‘ it is not

necessary to look into anyone's
face.

- The worker sells his hands, the
prostitute, her body; the traitor to

his class--his soul.

- A clever speaker knows when to be
silent.

- A union without struggle is like a
ship without sails. »
- You can wear a false diamond on
your hand but not to the pawn shop.

us hours instead of wages. .

— Foremen are like faithful dogs.
They guard the barn and sleep in a

kennel. -

- Arms manufacturers have golden
pockets, diamond fingers and hearts
of stone. V

- Even on the pavement, it is
possible to crawl into the mire.

- The boss who's a moron will still
be a genius--if his, workers are
dolts.

same struggles came the
United Electrical Workers" Fred
Wright and many .others. If the

message is simple and direct--the
struggle to create and maintain an
honest, militant union--it also has
a concreteness, a realism in

day-to-day life. Fantasy seemed to
take place mostly in jokes, like the
one which probably started about

Truman, when he asks the prostitute
how much she will ‘charge him. "If
you can raise ‘my skirt as high as

you've raised taxes and lower your

leap forward into industrial
reason,‘

Q
mason commas

” All they think about is money..."

pants. as low as you've pulled down
wages, you can have it for free."

The union had (for millions of

workers, anyway) been won, but not
real power over their lives. The
solidification of bureaucracy, the

3 erosion of rank-and-file control,
the first stirrings of automation
with all its ominous potential

brought yet another’ form of labor
humor. A little paper in Detroit
called Correspondence, and intended
to be the voice. of the workers
themselves, published in the 1950s
two main comic characters. "The
Needle," the cynical shop-floor
worker ("Boss, why would '1 put
crank-case oil in your coffee?") and
"Egghead," . ‘ the gullible
rank-and-filer ("I can't see why the
fellers criticize the new contract.
why it's so complicated they can't
even _understand half of fit." Or:
"Our committeeman ‘ is real
conscientious. He's been working on
my grievance for almost a year.").
This sounds like the old radical
attack upon the AFL, but the
alienation is deeper; it seems
unions or elections in themselves
will not solve the problems, but the
force of the whole society must act
in some way more difficult or
complex than the Wobblies or
Socialists thought. ‘



That sentiment carried over and
took on new emphasis with the impact
of the 1960s. None of the important
"underground comix" artists became
labor cartoonists or even had much
of significance to .say about labor
as such, any more than Abbie Hoffman
had much to say about unions.
Perhaps the closest approach during
the 1960s and early 1970s came
through the newspapers directed
toward Gls. The jokes of the 1960s
generation gone into the factory are
pretty bitter:' "why did the union
official cross the road?" asks one,
"To avoid the tissue." VDT workers,
similarly, write stories about
blowing smoke and pouring coffee
into the terminals--perhaps Cheech
and Chong are the Three Stooges of

I the 1970s and 19805?

We can't say for sure yet. All
across the country, little xeroxed
or offset magazines have ‘begun to
appear out of the hands_and brains
of 19-25 year olds who live at home
because they can't afford to move
out, work bad jobs and collect
unemployment checks.

Back in the labor movement, new
artists can be seen. Mike Konopacki
must stand as symbolic of others,
younger artists rallying to ‘the
spirit of resistance against
union-busting, deteriorating
conditions and the destruction of
social services. Konopacki grew up
in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, son of a
local commercial artist who took an
occasional turn at the factory
floor. He came to Madison,
Wisconsin, fort college and ended up
a schoolbus driver, active ‘union
member and alternative delegate to
the Madison Federation of Labor. He
began selling his work commercially
in 1976 through the Rothco
syndicate. But his baptism of fire
came through a newspaper strike and
lockout in Madison, when he joined
the strikers‘ paper as staff

cartoonist. An editor of that paper
later said, "His cartoons set our

tone, define our politics, and drive-

our policy positions home."

Konopacki and others like the
Steelworkers‘ Paul Zilg show labor
humor's earlyi moment of renewal. No
doubt it iwill take a variety of
forms. What may be safely predicted
is i that the _creative genius
expressed will run true to the
highest moments of the past. It will
be definite, cut out of.real life;
it will be thoughtful, eyes opened
as if for the first time _to the

idesperateness and the potential of

the situation; and it will very
likely be fantastic, because the
alternative to what now exists must
contain a very big dream. More than

all‘ this: it will be funny enough to ‘

bust a gut and send all the wretched
bosses to the hell they've prepared
for all of us. The host of vanished
labor/radical comics speak with one
voice: fuck ‘em if they can't take a
joke! Q25 joke, the last laugh on
them. ‘

A WORLD SAFE FROM AMERICA

IT'S EASIER TO STOP A SLOW MOVING VEHICLE THAN IT Is A RUNAWAY HORSE.
SAFER T00. ~ R a

what if we all did now what we're going to do in four years‘/time
about El Salvador?

It would save lots of trouble.

If you're a sophomore in high school, you could shoot off your foot.

It's going to happen anyway. If you do it yourself now, it will be

equally inconvenient in daily life, but you will be able to rest peacefully
from your struggles, untroubled by nightmares of killing people and
watching your friends die.

If you're a good-hearted, middle-of-the-road person, inclined to
think the government is as good-hearted as you are, you could

eat a sauteed El Salvadorian baby for lunch. In four years,

a picture of a fried child will reduce your trust in government and
make you oppose the war, but lots of children will need to be charred
before that picture gets to you. It would be kinder to barbecue

just one right now, and meditatively munch on the question of whether
babies should be killed to educate Americans.

‘If you're an El Salvadorian, you could blow your brains out. we

well-meaning Americans are on our way to help you, and you'd be
better off killing yourself cleanly instead of waiting for us to give
you high tech torture as you go. (Napalm is old hat. wait till

you feel what we've developed lately. would you like to be a
product tester?)

If you're an old anti-war person and you're opposed to the war right now,

you could get off your duff and go to Washington with 2 or 3 million

friends, or go to the town square with a few hundred or hundred thousand, all
on the same day, across the country, all of us. How bad is it going to have
to get before we do that? Must we have piles of corpses to march on?

How about we all get together--aging hippies and high school kids with
feet--on Labor Day to symbolize our need to get on with our real work,

which ain't making Central America messier than it is. How about this

time we suddenly and massively and surprisingly escalate our peace before
they escalate their war. :31‘

 

Think what the world would be like if America gets out of Central
America and stays out. Imagine itzi nuclear weapons, toxic wastes,
starving millions, shrinking wilderness, inflation, unemployment--

and time to work to change that. If we let the current administratignr
keep sneaking into Central America until they tell us it's too

late to leave, we will, sooner or later, have to stop our other work

to swim in the quicksand of trying to stop a jungle war. ,

But if now, tomorrow, very soon all of us who know that this

is a war to be missed do something that/demonstrates to ourselves
and our politicians how many of us there are, maybe we can

avoid this particular tragedy and leave Central America with the
horrible problems it already has instead of making them a

thousand times worse. It almost doesn't matter what we do as long
as we do it peacefully and in unison. lShould we meet at Washington
Monument on Labor Day? Each ring a bell for five minutes at noon
on some quiet weekdayﬁ Wear green arm bands on a given day to
prevent the need for black ones later? Let's talk about it,

tracks_ that ran in front of our
house 7;, walked out to the box and
got the mail from him. I found what
I'd expected. The personnel
department at McLouth Steel had sent
me a telegram ordering me back to
work after a seventeen month
lay-off. The telegram stated that I
was due at the personnel office that
morning at 8 a.m. for a pre~work
physical and reorientation session.
It was 2 p.m. at that point. The
people in the personnel department
and the telegraph company still ran
with the same efficiency as they did
in previous years. ‘

It takes about 18 hours of
driving to go from Gainesville,
’Florida to Detroit, not including
the stops along the way. I had to
point this out to the

inform them that I would be unable
to attend the reunion. I asked that
I be given two more days at least.

He said that would be fine since he
couldn't schedule me for a physical
until the following Monday morning.

According to our contract I had five
days to return to work from a
lay-off so I knew I had ample time
to pack, say goodbye to Susan, my
wife, and I burn whatever bridges
needed to be burnt. I was happy at
the‘ prospect of leaving Florida.
Happier still to be returning to a
job that, even with the concessions
the union had taken,“ paid

  KURT AND cnumas

I like Kurt Vonnegut‘s books
which are relevant and full of humor
and when I read them I fall off my
chair, clutch my stomach and roll on
the floor with laughter. But in his
recent letter to the Mill Hunk, Kurt
hopes that people would form
extended families and take better
care ' of each other than any
government could every do.

I agree with his assessment.
Most people, alienated from our
competitive ‘system, tend to revert
back to. their normal human nature,
which is to take care of each other.

But it's impractical, under our

current conditions, as far as long
term survival is concerned.
Currently workers are taking care of

each 'other with crumbs and band-aids
at great sacrifice, while the
privileged, who own the means of
production, take care of each other
with prodigious luxury.

I believe that the

pressures
created a by highly automated
computerized robots and pressures

from workers‘ desperation for jobs,
will ultimately force the privileged
to‘ give way so that, when the means

of production is publicly owned,
everybody in the country can be
privileged.

Fraternally,

And so, a packed meeting at

campaign to gain retribution for the
Northside community of Pittsburgh
through jobs on this interstate
highway. To many of the unemployed

the out-cries for equity rang a

v To provide an historical
background of the East Street Valley
Expressway is to flounder through
over thirty years ‘of political and
social chaos. The end product of

‘this »project, which began in 1952 as

a community improvement, will ease
the congestedi routes ~leading to
northern - Pennsylvania. In 1989,
after $400 million in tax dollars
have been spent, we will drive along
the expressway or I279/I579 as
PennDot officials call it. According
to Asst. Press Secretary for
District 11 of the Dept. of
Transportation, .the , highway will
consist of four segments of which
only one actually runs along the
East St. Valley. Although this is
true, all four segments run through
some portion of the Northside on
their way to 179. It is of little
comfort to the uprooted residents of
the valley that they are only a
"segment" of the roadway; the valley
was their whole life.

The East St. Valley was once a
thriving ethnic community; general
stores, row houses, churches, and
warehouses crowded the road until it

"From 1966 to 1976, Penn Dot had
transformed the ”blighted” valley into a‘
wasteland of garbage, weeds and steps
leading to grotesquely open spaces where
homes once proudly stood.” '

melted into woodlands and suburbs.
The houses were sturdy but showed
the wear and tear of generations of
service. From 1966 to 1976, pennnot

had transformed the "blighted"
valley into a wasteland of garbage,
Weeds» ' and steps leading to

grotesquely open spaces where homes
once proudly stood. This interstate
highway forced about fifteen hundred
people out into the recession-ridden
world they had hoped to avoid.

PennDot could be excused this
callous disruption ‘of life had they
conducted the relocation with

equity, compassion, and some sense
of bureaucratic organization -- they

did not.

Dr. Martin Krauss, a Northside
optometrist, watched his patients
suffer emotional and economic
hardship in the face of an
unrelenting governmental force. Some
residents had begun to fight PennDot
through the East. North Side

‘Citizen's Council. Krauss joined

these people, and eventually they
created a community-based coalition
called the Highway and Emergency
Relocation Team. HEART raged a war
against the agencies that were
offering unjust compensations for
property, failing :to come up with
comparable replacement homes, and

generally ‘ giving little
consideration to the emotional
setbacks these people were‘

experiencing.

The demolition was divided into
‘two phases. Phase I encompassed the
lower section of East St. and Phase
II began at the midsection,
continuing into the northern
suburbs. ‘ In 1967, HEART demanded
replacement values commensurate with
present real estate values, payment
to property‘ owners for home repairs
conducted tbetween l—the time the
project became public and appraisals
were made, and guaranteed mortgage
and interest rates. It was a start
toward equity V which was,
unfortunately, too late for some of
the residents in Phase 1.

"Most of the /families in the
Valley were older people ready to
retire," said Krauss, "Their homes
were small, well taken care of, and
served their , needs. They were
lawful, God-fearing people who
didn't know much about the law and
how to deal with it.

"When they announced the
highway, many, of them stopped
repairing and improving their homes.
This deteriorated the area and
caused many to receive less in

retributions."

Bernard Brill, a retired
railway man and life-long resident
of the East St. community, was
spared the loss of his home because
he lives on the east slope above-the
valley. twhat Brill lost to the
highway was ‘his heritage. what he
and his fellow parishioners managed
to save. —was St. Boniface Roman
Catholic Church. -

‘As la result of that trip, thed

Keeper of the National Register
came, looked over the property and
agreed to register St. Boniface as a
National Historic Landmark.

From that point, the church was
free from destruction. The \plans
were adapted to the present format
which places the highway fifty feet

in the air above the church and one
hundred twenty feet away from its
front doors on the west side of the
valley. \

Brill related an anecdote which
seems to illustrate the bureaucratic
bunglings surrounding A the
expressway.

"when \St.' Boniface was being
planned in 1924, the highway was
already at paper possibility," he

said, i"They were advised to build
the church in the valley because the
government planned to run the
highway ,along the ’two slopes above
East Street." ‘ v

The people who lost their homes
have spent fourteen years in some
other section of the city. They have
tried to put the exodus behind them:

At the time, she said that she
was very bitter. Today, she is
thankful for her health and feels
everything happens for the best.

"I am bothered by the delays
though," ‘she added, "where we used
to live nothing has happened. Our
old property is now a garbage heap."

Frank and Flora Chiaramonte
were also life-long residents of the

Northside community. Today they live.
on a_quiet suburban street. Flora is

the only member of‘ the family who
continues to have trouble making the
transition.l

"How "they treated us,"
Chiaramonte said, "You can't imagine
the feeling of bulldozers running
along the sides of your home. The
pictures on‘ the walls would shake
and shake. They were rough on us and
it was a very big upset for me."

She and‘ her husband also ran at

business located off East Street.
Their warehouse was torn down.
Chiaramonte said ‘that she used to

/help her husband, she socialized all

around the neighborhood, and she was
a parishioner of Mary Immaculate
Church which was also destroyed.

"It seems as if everyone was
broken up," she said, "I still go
down 'Northside to church and see

‘some of the people I knew, but I

feel they've all still got a lonely
place in their hearts. Somedays it
really gets me but I keep it to
myself."

The Madison Avenue Grill is a
family tavern ands Chester Smigel
depends on locals for his business.
The expressway depleted a major
portion of 4 what used to be a
transient clientele.

”'Ihe unemployed of the Northside feel the
government should make an effort to
compensate for the decades of anguish,
indecision and destruction.”

"The government's cutting my
throat. when the highway's finished,
it will strap me more. I've already
let three employees go," Smigel
said, "It's a sad thing. we're just
trying to make a living here."

Trying to make a living. Trying
to survive; that's all these working
class people ever wanted. Progress
is necessary and the expressway will
service people ifrom all ‘over the
country. It shall be the gateway to
Renaissance ll. But an entire
community has been sacrificed for
this new beginning.

The unemployed of Northside
feel the government should make an

effort to compensate for the decades

of anguish, indecision, and
destruction. Providing jobs on the
highway would bolster the area's
sagging economy. To the relocated

T East Street residents it would serve

as a symbolic retribution as well.

An _early August meeting held by

Pennnot, contractors, six union
representatives and six Northside
coalitions was successful in working
out some possible concessions.

An "official ‘from Pennnot said
that although they can encourage
contractors to ‘hire Northside
residents, they cannot mandate such
action for it is illegal to hire
workers from a specific area to
construct a federally funded
project. Since the highway was at a
standstill because of an auto
emissions bill that was not passed
until May, of this year, Pennnot
hopes to let eleven of the thirteen
contracts for the highway by March
of 1984. '

applications and when jobs "are

available, there will be a lottery."

Murphy said that he resents
comments that‘ infer political graft
such as gift-jobs. The lottery is an

equitable V solution to those’ who
question how the jobs shall be
awarded. A

Another issue that controls the

«eventual number of available jobs is

the, possibility of out-of-state
contractors. Murphy said that we
will have to negotiate with

. contractors from out of Pennsylvania

if that pis how the contract-bidding
progresses.

where these compromises leave
the unemployed of Northside remains
to be seen but the important fact is
jobs will be ,available. The latest
test‘ of wills between the residents
of this Pittsburgh community and the
governmental »agencies blindly
striving for progress can be viewed
as successful. To many‘ of those
warriors, 'victory is even sweeter
the second time around. '

TRAVELING PRIDE I

There's one thing I have to say
about President Reagan; he sure has
increased my political awareness and
has broadened my traveling
experiences at the same time.

Since he's been President, I've.

attended Solidarity Day in
Washington, D.C., September 19,
1981; Jobs and Peace Rally in New

York, June 12, 1982; the Rally
Against Reagan in Pittsburgh, April
6, 1983; and Jobs and Justice Day in
Harrisburg, June 15, 1983.

Many people have asked what I
gain by traveling to a mass
demonstrations. I usually answer
that I'm not looking to gain.
Rather, I'm trying not to lose what
few basic rights workers have left.

However, the Jobs and Justice

Day Rally, June 15, 1983, sponsored
by the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO,' did
turn out to be very meaningful to
me.

There are approximately 800,000
unemployed Pennsylvanians. A large
percentage of these unemployed are

steelworkers. On Jobs and Justice
Day at the Capitol Rotunda, many of
these unemployed let their
legislators know, in a very emphatic
way, that they wanted to be tax

paying citizens, not welfare cases.

I went to see Brian Clark, the
Democratic state representative from
Allegheny County. His knowledge of
the unemployment problem and his

efforts to help Pennsylvania's
recession victims was very
encouraging.

Clark, along with other

Democratic legislators, has planned
a program designed to provide relief
and ‘economic recovery to
Pennsylvani1ns. It's called the

Pennsylvania Program for Recovery,
Investment, Development, and
Education -(PRIDE). PRIDE's purpose

wmm DE

  

e"   
U t
Y

is to create 350,000 jobs by 1987
and 500,000 jobs by 1989.

PRIDE's funding will come from
three sources._ $100 million will
come from pensions; $217.6 million
from the federal government; and
$910.9 million from a 1% income tax
increase. '

Clark and others also
introduced a resolution to the House
of Representatives and it was
adopted the same day, June 7, 1983.
Addressed to President Reagan, the
resolution strongly recommends that
he impose steel import quotas for
five years. This is for two more
years than the International Trade
Conference (ITC) recommended.

Yes, it was very meaningful for
me to hear the unemployed chanting
"we want jobs" in the Capitol
Rotunda. And it was very meaningful
to me to visit with our public
servants and to see other people who
attended the Jobs and Justice Day

Rally doing the same.

CARP FEEDING

I have only known valleys:

basins of green creeks,

muddy orange rivers.

On tiers beneath crumbling bridges

’I have seen my dreams, dangling

from a fish line,
watched them fall,
like dough-wad bait‘
they ripple the water,
float a moment,

then sink

to dissolve.

when I am out of bread

it is time to leave,

to trace my steps I
along the railroad tracks.
I have come and gone,
always to return.

The moon shines from behind a cloud.i

I drop the last dough-wad for the carp.
As 1 walk along the iron rails

there is a loud splash

as a river rat

scurries back to his hole.

OF BIRDS       AND   FACTORIES

Book Review: Of Birds and Factories

by Sue Doro (c/o Peoples‘ Books and
Crafts, 1818 N. Farwell Avenue,
Milwaukee, WI 53202, $5.50 ppd.)

By Trudy Pax Farr
‘Chicago Steelworker

It ‘is not often that we, who
spend a. good part of our lives in
offices, hospitals,
restaurants, etc., balancing off the
need to earn a living with the need
to parent our children (while
harboring a frustrated rage at the
system that forces us to perform
that acrobatic balancing act) find
poems that articulate’ and reflect
that life, that give direction to
that rage. But that is exactly what
Sue Doro does in "Of Birds and
Factories."

Here is- a collection of poems
that speak of our ,anger and
strengths and aspirations, of our
fellowship ~with other workers, of
the challenge of a woman on a "man's
job," of the heavy "crumpled lunch
bag" weariness at the end of the
shift, of they straining toward our
freedom (surfacing again yand again
the poet's image of birds). These
poems speak, too, of the pains of
divorce and growing free, the
excruciating never-spent sorrow of a
son lost, of the joys and struggles
of mothering. we read, for example,
of the mother who makes a.phone call
on break and "then for_ten minutes/
she listens to her children/ grow."
we read about "the first shift, the
working class -- the people who turn
on the day." we read about the
terrible ravages working class
parents have suffered in this system

so that some of us have to say, "I
knew .you by the meaness the rich man
drove you to." There is hope too,

and lessons learned: "i'm learning/

how to use that anger we1l/ against

the ones/ that taught it best] to

you."

One of Doro's poems, "Muscle"
summarizes what this book is really
all about:

Listen!

This is a muscle poem.
Its sounds are loud
and can be frightening
to untrained ears.

It smells of oil

and sweaty T-shirts,
and steel shavings,
and cleaning compound
on concrete floors.

But for those who understand,
this poem wears
safety.g1asses

and steel toed boots

filled with pride and love.

As to those people

who are only moved

by greed and profits,

I want these words

to drop on them,

like a load of steel bars,
from a hundred feet

in the air!

This book,. then is a weapon in

our arsenal, to be used against
"those who plan our iruin and
destruction," as Meridel le Sueur
says in the introduction. "Let this
(book)," she says, "go from hand to
hand, heart to heart."

SOCRATES DIED AND
NOBODY NOTICED

By Carman Cortazzo Steelmill Laborer
Turtle Creek, PA

On May 21, 1983, a longshoreman
died in a highrise, monk-like
apartment room overlooking the San
Francisco Bay.

It did not make the front page
of any newspapers; his. wrestler's
face did not appear on the cover of
any national magazines; no

,late-night TV news shows did any

special reports.

Why such an oversight? Easy: he
never gained 1,000 yards a season in
the NFL (he never even held a
football in his enormous
workingman's mitts); he never sang

for assaulted an electric guitar with

a rock group (he didn't even have
long hair--in fact, no hair at all
covered his thick bullrope neck); he
wasn't a wise-cracking battle
surgeon on a prime-time sitcom nor
even a cheating husband on a daytime
soap (he didn't even own a TV); he
never, ’ six-pack 0‘ in hand,
cannonballed a high-powered~ auto
across the silver screen (he never
even had a driver's license, much
less a macho moustache); he never
held a public office of any kind
(be, because of his 10-hour days on
the docks and late-night hours of
battle with empty sheets of white
notebook paper,¢ probably never even
had time to visit. the White House
rotunda where legions of weeping
citizens »have shuffled past the

biers of handsome politicians); he.

never raped and murdered a dozen or
so young black boys down south nor
shotgunned, in cold blood, a farmer
family in the midwest nor caught
himself on fire while sniffing
powdery stuff nor was ever even
kidnapped by .any terror punks (he
was unloading cargo ships of food
and equipment while things like that
were going on); he was never

immortalized by loudmouthed male"

know-it-all sportscasters nor gazed
at with fake eye intensity by

maudlin female interviewers nor even
scandalized in supermarket tabloids
(hell, he never even made a Lite
Beer commercial). -

No small ' wonder ‘ then,
priorities being where they are
these days, that little note was
paid to the ‘ death of a

-lunchbag-carrying man who only’

bequeathed to the world a few meager
library shelves of titles that
include such works as "The True
Believerg" "The Passionate State of
Mind;" "The Ordeal of Change;" "The
Temper of Our Time;" "Working and
Thinking on the Waterfront;" "First
Things, Last Things;" "Reflections
on the Human Condition;" "In Our

V Time;" "Before the Sabbath;" and a

collection of them all; called
"Between the Devil and the Dragon."

Tandberg/ANS/LNS

And it is also of no small
wonder why the elitist intellectuals
(those opposers of individual
liberty) have tried to sweep him
under the carpet. What was it he
said about them that rubbed them so
wrong? Oh, yes: "Elitists never tire
of repeating that only the chosen
few matter; »the majority are pigs."
And to prove to them that such an
attitude was loathsome he would
simply ask them that if such a thing
were true "how does it happen that a
he-pig marries a she-pig and a
Leonardo is born?" V

And it no doubt aggravated them
further when he told them that "they
are inhospitable to any suggestion
that the mass of people are lumpy
with ‘unrealized potentials." That
"the masses are a mine rich in all
conceivable talents." And that our
problem is that "we have as yet no
expertise lof talent mining but must
wait for a chance to wash nuggets
out of hidden veins."

And these snobbish opposers had
their last straw with him when he
assaulted them right between their
elitist thighs: "The
will feel only at home where an
exclusive elite are in charge of
affairs, and it-matters not whether
it be an elite of aristocrats,

intellectual‘

soldiers, merchants, or
intellectuals. ‘He would prefer an
elite that is culturally literate,
but will put up with one that is
not. What he cannot endure is a

society dominated by common people.

There is nothing he loathes more
than government of and by the
people." '

A knock-out punch to end all‘
knock-out punches, delivered’ by a
master. T

And what would this already
forgotten master have said to all
the anger that has been vented here
toward the. unthinking

hero-worshippers of our time?

It is hoped that he would have
simply shrugged his massive
shoulders' and said what he said many
times: "The, hardest thing to cope
with is not selfishness or vanity or
deceitfulness, but sheer stupidity.
One needsl the talents of an animal
trainer to deal with the stupid."

But what is hoped for most is
that long after the hero-worshippers

have _forgotten their foolish idols a

fgreat and valuable discovery~ will
take place. The discovery of Eric
Hoffer.

THE MILL HUNK

STARTED 5 YEARS AGO . .

by people who were frustrated by the way all other

publications are run. The Mill Hunk Herald is trying to
be different. It is set up so that the rank and file readers
will control it. not merely the publishers. The Herald is
the _first of its kind—. an experiment in democratic
-journalism. . .
Here's whet we mean:

WHAT IT IS: A quarterly magazine for the reports,
opinions and stories of the average person.

WHAT IT IS NOT: Profit—making, owned by anyone.
operated from the top down, ass-kissing, the
Pittsburgh Press.

THE NAME: (Catchy, ain’.t it?) It was chosen for that
reason. However. this meg is not just for millworkers.

the title simply acknowledges the important work they e

do (or used to do) in Pittsburgh. The Herald is for all

working people: homemakers. office employees,

retirees, nurses, teachers, bus drivers, bartenders, you
name it. - r ‘

WHO CAN WRITE FOR THE HERALD: Anyone can.
There are very few professional writers involved. For
this kind of publication, polished writing style is not as
crucial as timely and real things to say. So what you
write and how you say it will be printed.

HOW ARE ARTICLES CHOSEN: At editorial meetings

~ (all subscribers may attend). all articles that have been
submitted for publication are‘ circulated and rated: -

from best to worst: by all present. This way those doing
the layout know the priorities. This may seem like a lot

‘ of trouble, but it has turned out to be a veryfair, upfront
and interesting process.
HOW IT IS FINANCED: Subscriptions, donations,
newsstand salesand fundraisers. (Please refer to
our EVENTS page!)

UNORGANIZED UNIONS

I really liked the issues of
the Herald you sent. Good poetry and
good politics. We could use
something like that around here - or
up on the Iron' Range. There are
towns up there, where everyone used

'to work in the mines or the taconite

mills, and now they have 90%
unemployment. There are a ,lot of
guys up there, with nothing to do
except drink, and I'm not sure they
have any drinking money left. They
could use a project such as a paper.

Things in Minneapolis are not
as bad. I think unemployment is only
running 7 or 8%. Though it varies
from industry. to industry. 'My
roommate is a truckdriver. There are
something like 4,000 union
truckdrivers out of work in the
area. Probably more, I haven't been
keeping close track. (I really ought
to. Pat pays half the rent.) Anyway,
the bosses .are using the high
unemployment‘ to get rid of the
union, and to drive down wages. Pat
hasn't had a raise in over two
years, and they keep trying to talk
him into taking a pay cut. His
company isn't union - and probably
will not become union, since the
Teamsters don't seem to have any
interest at all in organizing.

The union truckdrivers go after
the non-union drivers. Accidents

happen to trucks, and the Teamsters»

get up picket lines around non-union
operations. But they aren't trying
to sign anyone. All they're trying
to do is get business away from the
non—union companies, back to the
union companies.

Of course, what happens is -'
T the unorganized drivers get

thoroughly pissed and swear they
will never join any union ever.

Back before the first world war.

- or maybe it was in the 1920s - the
I.W.w., was able to organize
integrated unions in the south. The
way they did it was to say - any
worker who isn't organized is a
potential scab. So (they'd tell the
white workers) if you won't let
black workers into your union, you

vare helping the bosses. Because they

will use the people you ‘won't
organize to break your union.

The Teamsters - 60 years later
and more - have not yet figured this
Qu t .

Of course, I guess the best way
to think about the Teamsters is not
as a union, but as a branch of the
Mafia. They make plenty of sense, if
seen that way.

I suppose I ought to stop
babbling like this. I spend a lot of
time thinking about the American

“union movement. I hate to think

about American working people losing
everything they've won in the past
40 or 50 years, but that seems to be

a possibility, and the union
movement is so chickenshit about it
- or it seems to me to be. I

haven't been in a union, since the
last time I worked a regular job,
which was the summer of '81. Maybe I
have lost touch, and dynamic things
are happening, which [ don't hear
about .

Yours in solidarity,

than to maybe keep going to school

to speak. I feel guilty that I can't
find‘ a teaching job in English - I
feel mad as hell at myself because I
believed tenure professors who said
take composition, and linguistics
courses - you'll get a job - so now
I have credentials, no job, and not
the education I went to school for

in the first ’place - and I feel
guilty' because I don't want to

get much ‘comfort out of the fact
that very few of us are doing what
we ‘want to do - How small the pie is
we're all scrambling for - Somebody
along the line recently told me that
this is reality - the’ rite of

I UNEMPLOYEQEND

As an unemployed journeyman

— Boilermaker, with twenty« years in

the trade; I’ have a deep sympathy
for the steelworker who is
unemployed too. But I am not giving
up and I'm not going to cry about
it. I will ejust do the best I can
with whatever it takes to get the
job done. ' ' I

I feel. a fire burning with the
despair of the unemployed in this

comes to my mind: '

An end even with terror,
is better than terror without end.

man-rr voun REVIEW I

We very much appreciate that
you published a review of Staughton
Lynd's The Fight Against Shutdowns
and carried a blurb on your back
cover (Spring '83 issue).

we didn't ' appreciate the
reviewer's cheap shot that the price
of the book is so high that it may
not get to‘ the people for which it
is intended. It is probable that a
big publisher could have gotten it
out cheaper, but it would have been
a different ’book ... a point that
Moberg in‘ II: picked up on in his
review. At Singlejack, ‘no one has
ever ‘been paid except the writers. A
reviewer or‘ critic could well make
the point that a dollar is a lot to
pay for MHH. Relatively speaking, it
is _an expensive item for those now
unemployed. 'But I know you are
getting it out for the least amount

possible. As editors, I think you

should not be the medium for shots
like this against others.

So long for now, best,

' The things about ‘hard times

., hitting working‘ families is that it

is necessary‘ to be tough and pull
everyone through A the crisis.
Sometimes .being tough, though, means
ignoring the -problems ‘behind our
lack of jobs and saying "well, it
could be worse,"\while~someone older
remembers worse. times at Fisher
Body, or ,remembers getting by on
less than 1980's UAW grandsons and
granddaughters are. I \

'I worry about this. It makes it
a hard to fight, because as deep as
the‘ time cards and sweat run, our
‘I toughness or pride runs as deep, and
I when I see anger muffled by just

being thankful pto have at job - I
worry it's this that will take us
back to before unions, before a
sense of ourselves‘ as a class,
before things ,like the Mill Hunk
were around. ‘And what makes it
frightening, .what -gives ‘it all its

horrible power is that I can see it«

sometimes in myself, can feel myself
forming ‘that, cover, I know will get
me through.s * '

Anyway, that might be what this
poem is about. And it might also be
a suggestion on an issue - what are

the things we have_ to‘ fight in'

ourselves \ before we can pull
together and fight who we should be
fighting? The — middle class and
their textbooks. and' psych. majors
might give this -subject a sentence

‘or, two. But‘ since I distrust the

knowledge of‘.the‘ upper classes as

much as I dislike cooked carrots,~Ii

never force myself to go’ into a

.cooked carrot restaurant.

I guess I want to hear help
coming ‘from people and experiences I
trust. I
