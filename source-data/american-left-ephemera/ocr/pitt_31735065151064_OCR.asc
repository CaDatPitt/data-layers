Mine-Mil 50th Convention
opens March 14 in Spokane

SPOKANE, Washington—-Bargaining will top the list of key issues facing the 50th Mine-Mill convention when it opensiitll N
here Monday, March 14. l

The International Executive Board, in session at the Davenport Hotel all last week, com

convention which is expected to make h
at '10 'o’clock Monda"y'r'norni'ng. ' ~

Bargaining councils

yistpory from the moment it is gavelled to order

Even before the convention begins, many delegates will have taken part in a
busy week-end of bargaining council meetings. The Anaconda, Kennecott, Phelps-

Dodge, AS&R, Northwest,
National Lead and Allied
Industries Councils were all

“ to meet and begin hammer-

ing out bargaining program
and strategy for 1955.
President_John Clark was
to keynote the convention
Monday, in a speech indi-

cating the major issues’

facing -the delegates, in-

p cluding labor unity, organ-

izing the unorganized, polit-
ical action, uni-on defense,
the fight for economic
9-. . . . .
security, and civil liberties.

Contract issues

Highlighting the second
day was to be an address
by Orville Larson, national

bargaining coordinator, on‘

the overall bargaining pic-
ture this year. Bernard W.
Stern, Mine-Mill ‘research
director, was to follow with
a chart talk on major bar-

gaining is su e s including V

wages, pensions, health
and welfare, the guaranteed
annual wage and the
shorter work week.

Labor unity

_ Labor unity was also due
for heavy discussion at the
convention. Reports that
other unions and federa-

Meeueew mm FBI in 195
Jencks story 

tions are pressing Mine-
Mill for amalgamation or
affiliation were to be gone
over, as the delegates talk
about the possibility that
our Union will once again
h.ave organic ties with
other sections . of the labor
movement.

Canadian autonomy

Side by side with the
labor unity issue will be the
proposals for creation of an
autonomous Canadian sec-
tion of Mine-Mill. The
moves toward autonomy,
outlined by Canadian Vice

‘ President Nels Thibault in

a report to the convention,
were aimed to strengthen
Mine-Mill’s bargaining and
political positions in Can-
ada, and at the same time
keep the strong fraternal
bonds that have always
held together metal work-
ers of the two countries.

Organizing

Organizing the unorgan-
ized in the industry was
also expected to take an
important place in conven-
tion debate. The increasing
number of light metal oper-
ation; and the trend toward
open pit mining were ‘both

key questions to be handled
underithis heading.

Defense

The defense of Mine-Mill,

and of leaders such as M. E. .

Travis and Clinton Jencks,
was down on the agenda

for later in the week. "Re-
ports on the Matusow con-
fessions, the book “False
Witness,” and the El Paso
hearings of last week were
due to feature this discus-
sion. S

Political action

Political action, including
preparations for the 1936
election campaign, was an-
other important ‘topic.
Under the same heading
legislation before both Con-
gress and the state legis-
latures was to be discussed.

Integration

The battle to maintain
civil liberties—-both in the
United States and Canada

. —--and to press for integra-

By JOHN CLARK

THE CORNERSTONE of Mine-
Mill policy for the past several
years has been labor unity———particularly

-unity in the non-ferrous metals industry.

And it has paid off in better settlements
for ourselves and for members of other
unions.

 .We have established the Anaconda Con-

 ference, consisting of AFL and CIO un-

ions as well as our.own, and we have de-
veloped closer relations with other unions
who bargain with other major companies.

Inlegislative and political action, we
have joined with AFL and C10 in fighting
for better laws, defeating anti-labor bills
and electing pro—labor candidates for public
office. '
' By working along these lines We have
brought closer the unification of all work-
ers in the industry.

End of disunity
 PROJECTED merger of AFL and

I C10 is a good thing for all labor. It ends
‘ the historic split which has prevented the

fullest growth and achievement of the

labor movement and opens the possibility

of further unity of all segments of labor.

 .,At the same time it affords the possibility

for the workers in the metal mining indus-
try to put an end to the division that was

» enforced upon us by the actions of the

CIO leadership in 1950—actions which we
strenuously opposed in the interests of
unity..

The movement towards unity, both
through the ‘labor movement and within

'our own industry, is the result of tre-

mendous pressure. which the monopolies
have brought to bear upon the workers

“ " of our two countries.

The greater drive for profits, accom-
panied by the «anti-labor policies of the

_.Republican administration, and the pas-
, » sage of “right to work” laws in many
” ;_- states have forced all sections of labor to
L’ come closer together in self-defense.

These same pressures existing‘ In our

 » _ own industry have resulted in the realistic
possibility of the Mine-Mill and Smelter

Workers rejoining the mainstream‘of "the

‘labor movement in the near future.

. Exploratory discussions

_ OUR OFFICERS determined some
month ago to seize the opportunities which
we saw were being created by the changing
situation. After thorough examination by

 the Executive Board, a committee" consist-p
 ing of the five International officers and
'~ ‘ Board Member Pezzati was established and

instructed to pursue actively and ener-

ii“-‘getically the exploration of all avenues
‘ 1 leading toward the re-affiiation of Mine-

‘Mill with a major section of the. labor

. movement.

« This committee has engaged recently

‘i in a series of discussions with representa-

tives of various sections of organized labor.

  To ‘date, these discussions are only explor-
_atory, but they nevertheless indicate that

Mine-Mill, as the dominant union in the
metal mining industry, is recognized as
the main base for achieving unity in the
industry within the new federation.

But such a place will not be achieved

 

  

"The President's Corner" this week reprints
the Labor Unity section of President C/or/<'s
report to the 50th Mine—Mi// Convention.

‘ without the sharpest struggle. There are

top labor leaders who will seek, and in
fact are already seeking, to divert the new
labor federation into a monopoly of their
own which would serve the interests of the
corporations rather than those of the
membership.

Unity based on principle

0 SUCH leaders, the program and poli-
cies of Mine—Mill, with our historic mili-
tancy and internal democracy, represent
an unwelcome danger. Such leaders will
try to emasculate Mine-Mill as they and
others have tried to do over the past sev-
eral years. They will try to make us pay
a heavy price for any affiliation, a price
that would involvethe destruction of the
very principles which have made Mine-
Mill the outstanding union it is.

I wish to serve notice now that we will
never agree to such a price. To us, labor
unity means greater strength to win great-
er gains for our members and to better
defend our common welfare. We see in

unity the chance for a more successful-

struggle against the employers and against
political reaction.

_ But this calls for unity based on a
principle, a principle which would uphold
the equal rights of all minorities, advance
the growth of industrial unionism and pre-
serve and extend union democracy.

There should be no illusions that these
these principles. ‘

Sources of strength

THESE SOURCES of strength will be
drawn upon during the course of any and
all merger negotiations so that we can de-
feat the attempts that will be made to
smother or swallow up Mine-Mill, to purge
its leadership or to chop it up in pieces
either before or after any affiliation is
arranged.

I urge this Convention to go on record
authorizing the Officers to pursue negoti-
ations for the purpose of establishing our
affiliation with the mainstream of organ-
ized labor—- I
—that suchaffiliation be established on

a basis that will protect the integrity
and identity of the Mine, Mill and Smelt-

. er Workers;

—that will lead to organic unity of the
workers in the non-ferrous metals indus-
try in order‘to bring maximum bargain-
ing power to bear upon the employers;

—that will guarantee equality to our
Negro and Mexican-American brothers;

—that will assure the maintenance of our
democratic rights to control our own
organization and elect our own leaders.

To win these objectives, they must be
guaranteed not merely on a piece of paper
signed and sealed in the office of some
labor executive; they must be fought for
down in the grass roots of the labor move-
ment by the rank and file who have the
most to win and the most to lose.

ravls reslgnauon
BAYARD, N. M.——The “deep: regret” of officers and

members'of Mine—Mill Local 890 over the resignation of

M. E. Travis as Int’l.Secretary—treasurer was expressed
by President Juan Chacon in a statement to the press_

late last month.

Chacon‘ explained his statement as an answer to

press hints_ that Local 890
was “indifferent or pleased
over the development.” “As
usual,” he said, “they are
way off the beam.”

“We, the Mexican-Amer-
ican members of this union
have a very special reason
to feel a warm relationship
to Brother Travis,” the.
president of Local 890 said.‘

. “For Brother Travis has
been a staunch and consist-
ent supporter of the Mexi-
can-American workers
within Mine-Mill and in the
labor movement in general.

“He was a key figure in
Mine-Mill’s Southwestern
drive to reduce and elimi-
nate 'area wage differen-
tials, the dual wage scale,
to fight for higher wages
and better .job conditions,
for advancement and job
promotion opportunities
for Mexican-American
workers.

“This,” said Chacon, “is
why the mining companies
and their stooges in gov-
ernment, including the
NLRB, were out to get him
with baseless and frame-up
charges. The best refuta-
tion of all the lies against
Brother Travis was ex-
pressed by his very act of
resignation, for in so doing,
he placed the interests of
this great International and
its 100,000 members above
his own personal interests.”

At the same time, Cha-
con made it clear that the
members of Local 890“ can
be counted on for “full and
enthusiastic support” to
Albert Pezzati, who was
appointed to replace Travis.

     ‘BAYARD, N. M.—-It took a three-day strike to do

§,ll3.‘but Workers at the Santa Rita mine last week taught
he

SSOLIS.

Thefirst lesson was that Mine-Mill Local 890 and
__ts members will not tolerate mistreatment of any worker

man.

' , an  _.
, ﬁlls second lesson was
_ docked if they are late to work as a result of a break-

that workers should not be

own of company-operated buses. .

The third lesson is that when a 10-minute break is
negotiated in a contract, the company cannot take away
that break on its own say-so. "

The lessons began when Max Hale, Kennecott fore-
man, docked 13 workers in the track department because
they were late for work.. All 13 of the men arrived at

the mine on a company bus.
They had left home in plenty of
time, but the bus made so many
stops that it got there_ late.
The workers, through their
shop steward, Albert Perez, pro-
tested to Hale. His answer was
that if they couldn’t get to work
on time by bus, they should
walk. He refused to take back
his order toldock their pay.
The union tried to settle these
beefs. peacably, but the company
got tough and tried to back up

‘its unjust foreman. By the end

of the week, the workers were

~ convinced it would take more
._ than talk to show the company

that Hale was wrong.

On Sunday, the 6th, the entire
mine was struck by the Santa
Rita Mine-Mill members. The
picket lines were honored by

members of other unions work-
ing in the pit.

The company claimed the
strike was a violation of the un-
ion contract. Union spokesmen
pointed out that Hale had vio-
lated the union contract time
after time. The company then
agreed to sit down and talk
over all the beefs.

After three days, the dispute
was settled-—and it was a vic-
tory for Local 890 and the
Santa Rita workers right across

_ the board.

0 The rest period of 10 min-
utes an hour was restored.

O The company agreed to hire
four extra operators, in addition
to the present eight, in the track
department.

0 The company agreed to pay

the 13 men for the lost time.

A Silicosis will be subject
‘ of convention evening

Dr. Leon Lewis, noted West Coast physician and
former professor of industrial hygiene at the University
of California, will be the featured speaker at the silicosis
panel for consrention delegates. It will be held on
Wednesday evening, March 16, at the Hotel Davenport

in Spokane.

, Dr. Lewis will lead off the discussion‘with an ac-
count of recent medical developments in diagnosis. care ‘

and treatment of silicotics.

Other speakers on the panel will be Herman Clott
and Bernard W. Stern. Mine—Mill's Washington repre-
sentative and Research Director, respectively.

Following brief talks there will be a question-and-
answer period, and discussion from the floor.

Brother Clott, who has been working with various .
Congressmen in preparation of federal silicosis legis-

\ lation, will talk on state and federal laws dealing with
silicosis and will analyze various proposals now being

considered.

 Utah enacts phony
dright-to-work’ law

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—Despite a last-ditch bat-
tle by a united labor movement, the Utah legislature has
passed a mis-called “Right to Work” bill, and Governor

g_ Bracken Lee has signed it into law.

Mine-Mill was in the thick of the fight to stop the
bill, just as it was last year when a similar Chamber of
Commerce campaign was turned back. The 1955 _cam-
paign against the measure was led by the Utah Lab
Political Action Committee, which represents the AF ,
the CIO and independent un_ions in this state.

As the fight over the “right to wreck” proposal
moved toward a climax in February, Arthur-Magna Local
392 assigned two leading members, Carl Borup and Inar

Larson, to work virtually full
time against it. Bingham
Canyon Local 485 put Joe Dis-
penza and Stan Loader on call
to work on the campaign, and
they spent many hours on it.
The bill was passed on a
straight party vote, with the
Republican majority in both
houses out-voting the Democrats
who fought the proposal.
Organized labor was joined
by the Catholic church in its op-
position to the bill. Both Salt
Lake City daily papers sup-

The MINE-MILL UNION

ported the “right to scab” plan.

Governor Bracken Lee, as he
signed the bill, claimed it was
“better” than similar laws in
other states, because it applied
to all organizations, not just la-
bor. This of course is nonsense,
since labor unions are the only
kinds of organization which
fight for union security of their
members.

Utah is the 18th state to put
‘right to wreck” legislation on
the books.

agreements

LOS ANGELES, Calif.—Out-
standing co-ntract agreements

have been reached by Mine-Mill
Local 700 with two National
Lead company subsidiaries here.

At Magnus Metals, the new
pact includes, a general wage
increase of 5 cents an hour,
retroactive to January 1, plus
a $9.80 a month Blue Cross
policy covering every worker
and his dependents, paid for
fully by the company. The
Magnus contract also calls for
a union shop, improvements in
the grievance set-up, seniority,
shop stewards system, vacation
and holiday clauses.

At Morris P. Kirk, a 5 cent
general wage increase is retro-
active to last December 3. ‘An-
other 4 cents an hour is set
aside for purchase of Blue

Shield medical and hospital,

insurance for the worker and
his family at no cost to the em-
ployee. The company agreed to
abolish the old contributory life
‘insurance and annuity plan,
and replace it with a union pro-
posal to give every employe
$1.75 a month for each year of
service upon retirement.

The new Kirk plan also calls
for $3,000 life insurance, dis-
ability pensions and other bene-
fits paid for by the company.
Eligibility for holiday pay was
cut from 90 to 30 days, posting
all job vacancies and a number
of other contract improvements
were also won at Kirk.

Eight states raise I,
unemployed benefits

Legislatures in eigh states
this winter have passe bills to
jack up unemployment compen-
sation benefits. And higher job-
less pay bills are still pending
in about 15 more state as-
semblies

Among the states in which
benefits have ‘been hiked are
Idaho, where the maximum was
boosted from $25 to $30; Ten-

nessee, where the hike was from

$26 to $30; and Utah, where the
old ceiling of $27.50 was raised
to $33.

Still pending are proposals to
raise the ‘maximum to $50 i

California,.and to 50% of reg?

ular pay in Utah. The average
now provided for in state laws
amounts to about $25 weekly.

the authorities have taken a firm stand
and school integration has taken place

smoothly and easily.

the face of advance. .A Louisville court
has sentenced’ a white couple to 15 years
in prison for selling their house to a Negro

opportunities for jobs, on-the-job training,
upgrading and promotions will be the rule.

Until that day, the struggle for inte-
gration must go on. A

: The Hernandez case

THE situation ofthe Mexican people in
the Southwestis much the same. An his-

toric advance was made last year in the ]

Supreme Court’s decision in the Hernandez
case in Texas. The Court reversed a con-
viction. hn the grounds that persons of
Mexican descent had been excluded from
the jury. This is the samechallenge as
made by Mine-Mill in the Jencks case.

Deporiations

HE most serious abuse of the rights of
the Mexican people in this country, both
Mexican nationals and those whose homes
are here, is in connection with the annual
mass deportations.

Every year, while immigration officials
look the other way, big farmers of the
Southwest send recruiting agents and leaf-
lets into Mexico. With false promises, they
lure tens of thousands of needy farm
workers across the border for seasonal
work. The wages are bare subsistence;
conditions are indescribable. The workers
remain unorganized under threatof terror
and deportation.

When these workers are no longer need-
ed, the immigration officials suddenly
notice their presence. They are rounded
up with a great deal of brutal mistreat-
ment and dumped across the border. Many
have been left penniless at points where
they had to walk a hundred miles across
desert to the nearest town. ’ ‘

No native-born person of Mexican de-
scent who has incurred the wrath of an
employer is safe u-nder these circum-
stances. \

Our Union should be in the forefront
of the fight for guarantees by our govern-
ment of wages and conditions for workers
imported for seasonal work. This should
include the right to organize, bargain col-
lectively and strike.

BAYARD, N._M.—After
weeks of tough negotiations, Lo-
cal 890 came through with an
agreement to re-open AS&R’s
Groundhog lead and zinc mine
which had been closed for 22

5 months.

In order to reopen, the com-
pany had demanded a 42%C an
hour wage cut, or a sliding scale
which would have cut wages 10c
for every 1c drop in the price of
zinc. Both were defeated, and
wages maintained. The union
also won a common termination
date for its contract with other

7 .. “AS&R locals.

Page 4-—MarcI| I4. .1955

This very tough fight, involv-
ing 15 meetings with the com-
pany, was won despite the pres-
sure of almost two years of un-
employment at this mine, and
despite the fact that CIO Steel
and certain AFL unions had
signed wage cut or sliding scale
agreements in other places.

Local 890 received the support
of Mine-Mill locals all over the
AS&R chain. Workers are now
being recalled in accordance
with seniority. Time accumu-
lated toward vacations, up to the
shut-down", will apply on 1955
vacations; .

 ine-week Rhodesia  i  

copper strike ends

T HE END of the nine—week-old Northern Rhodesia copper
strike last week brought little immediate relief to a copper-hungry ,
world although resumption of production there is expected to show ,
up in larger refined deliveries by about July. Market demand for
lead .and zinc continued to be strong. 0' -
Other recent developments include:

Copper

The London copper market, mains outlet for Rhodesian copper,
showed little reaction to the ending of the long strike... The price

for copper there dropped one cent when the news first broke and C

then, within a day, recovered half of that loss. The market reac-

tion, which came as a surprise to many, indicated that, as of now, V .

European markets for copper are still fairly strong—a1though the _
situation could change within the next few months. ’ '
Here in the U. S., users of copper were buying all that was

available at 33 cents a pound. The government released 8,000 tons . A

of March purchases for the stockpile in “the face‘ of fabricators’ re-
quests for over 35,000 tons. V‘

Scrap copper, last week, was selling at prices above the equiv-
alent for refined. '

Kennecott placed its Ray, Arizona mines on a seven“-day week,

following similar action taken at its Utah and Nevada properties.

A Lead

Sales, of lead in the U.S. were at good volume at 15 cents a
pound. Foreign markets were also reported to be buying all lead
that was available at good prices.  *

U. S. smelters, in January, were unable to secure all the ‘for- »»

eign ore that they could»« have used. Smelters receipts of foreign ~
ore in January dropped 28% from the previous month—.from 16,-
020 tons in December to 11,502 tons in January. As a result, less
lead is expected to be available to consumers in February and
March.

, Zinc . 

Greater use of zinc in die-castings ‘by automobile makers
underlies the present strong zinc markets——it particularly shows
up in the heavy demand for special high-grade zinc., which is used
for die casting. Demand for prime Western grade has also in-
creased but not to the same extent.

Stocks of zinc held by producers are expected to show further
sharp declines when the February and March statistics are finally
released.

Consumers are now reported to be placing their orders for zinc

There’s plenty of proof that Attorney General Brownell and other Justice Depart-

he had lied on the witness stand.
, What’s more, Brownell knew—officially—,as long ago as last June that there was

Charlo-He News

0 Starting in the summer of
1952, when Matusow charged
a communist “plot” to infiltrate
the Boy Scouts, Editor Vic
Reinemer of the Charlotte, N.
Carolina, Daily News, began
making a “Matusow collection.”

After documenting “the incred- .

ible Matusow story,” Reinemer
now says, “our findings were
sent, as information, to con-
gressmen who had used him as
(L witness, and to the American
Legion magazine which had

pnI)lislz,ed an article by him." A

Only one Congressman, Kit
Clardy of Michigan, .replied——-
with a red-baiting blast at the
Charlotte News. Senator Pat
McCarran, who got one of
Reinemer’s surveys, defended
Matusow by saying that “he
acted for more than (L you/r as
an in.fo'rmunt for the FBI.” _

dicated column November 8,

told in detail how he had lied.
He also wrote Senator McCar-
thy on August 23, 1953, con-
fessing that he had lied. ‘Next
month I will be 28—twenty-
eight years of being a coward
and dishonest,’ lie wrote.”
The Bishop again.

OBishop Oxnam took the
witness stand in Washington on
October 18, 1954, to testify-
under oath———about his conver-
sations with Marfusfow last
spring, in which Matusow told
him he had manufactured evi-
dence for congressional com-
mittees and government rec-
ords. V

Deliberafo

But the failure of the Jus-
tice Department was deliberate.

A speech by Assistant At-
torney General Warren Olney
at Mackinac Island, Michigan,
on July 23, gavé the tipoff on a
Justice Department campaign
to cover up not only the Matu-
sow turnabout, but also the
vast amount of information
which had come to light by
then about Paul Crouch, Man-
ning Johnson and some of the
other - professional  witnesses.
Olney coinplained that the Jus-

EL PASO, Texas—-Harvey Matusow returned to Judge R. E. Thomason’s court
last week and revealed that several months before the Jeneks trial, he went to the
FBI office in Santa Fe, N. M., to report that he was “unwilling to testify” in the

trial.

He told the FBI officials in August or September, 1953, that he had “misgiv-
ings” about his testimony against Jencks, and‘ indicated that it would be “dis-
honest,” Matusow revealed during -the formal hearing on themotion for a new trial

for Clinton Jencks.

When defense attorneys asked the court to order the FBI to turn over the state-
ment Matusow said he made in the Santa Fe FBI office before the Jencks trial,

Judge Thomason overruled the
defense request. The statement

. ;:.ad been written down by the

.FBI official and Matusow said

he signed it.
Matusow was on the witness
stand in Judge Thomason’s

‘court most of the week. A fed-
eral grand jury, meeting in an-
other chamber in the same

- courthouse, was adjourned late

Wednesday after telling Judge

J B , Thomason it had “nothing to

days of hearings on Matusow.
Grand Juries

THE GRAND JURY had
been convened here, as similar
bodies -had been called both in
Denver and New York, in a des-
perate Justice Department at-
tempt» to discredit Matusow’s
January 28 affidavit repudiat-
ing his testimony in the Jenck’s
trial of January, 1954. The Den-

were also dismissed without re-
porting anything.

Headlines

BUT MATUSOW was easily
the headline-maker of the week.
During the lengthy and bellig-
erent cross-examination, by Da-
vid Harris, special assistant to
the Attorney General, Matusow
told the court:

OThat he told columnists

Drew Pearson and Elmer Davis‘ .

in October, 1953, that he had
lied on witness stands all over
the country, and told Sen.
Henry Jackson of Washington
the same thing some time in the
fall of '53.

0 That he wrote Senator Joe
McCarthy in» August, 1953, ' say-
ing he never wanted to be a
witness again.

0 That before the Jencks
trial,.he signed an affidavit ad-
mitting he had lied about the

New York Times. He told a rep-
resentative of Time magazine
that he lied -about it, too, but
did not sign an affidavit to
that effect until after Jencks
was convicted.

OThat- he was converted to
the Church of Jesus Christ of

Latter Day Saints in Dallas,‘
‘ Texas, in the fall of 1954.

0 That his decision to “tell
the truth” about his false testi-
mony was not made suddenly,
but came aszthe result of three

,ex_periences—1) the “harsh sen-

tence” meted to court martialed
Sgt. Claude Batchelor in Octo-
ber, 1954, after which Matusow
wrote Attorney General Brown-
ell saying he did not want to
testify again; 2) a plane trip
in July, 1954, from Washington

Matusow finally turned to the

no more questions-—even at the

' risk of contempt-—until Harris

apologized for “insulting" his
religion.

Ike appoints more

labor-opposed men

to gov’t positions

WASHINGTON, D. C.———Labor’s anger is rising, as
it watches the growing list of anti-union appointments
made by President Eisenhower.

A fightwas shaping up in the Senate over choice
of Theophil Kammholz to be general counsel of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board. The Senate Labor Com-
mittee approved the nomination, but Democratic Sena-
tors McNamara of Michigan and Douglas of Illinois
sent. in a sharply.-worded minority report against the

Chicago company lawyer.

Kammholz is strongly opposed by Mine-Mill. As

lawyer for one of the com

Local 758 bargains, he has prov-
en his hatred for unions and his
pro-employer bias. Douglas and
McNamara listed 32 companies
and employer groups Kammholz
has represented and’ 16 AFL,
CIO and independent unions he
has opposed as an employer
spokesman.

They said Eisenhower’s policy

of appointing employer-minded

people to posts’ demanding im-
partiality “is on the way toward
undermining the confidence of

a living in the impartiality of
the present board.”

College youth campaign
for ‘Salt of the Earth’

HOLLYWOOD, C.alif.—The youth of America have
taken over the fight to smash the’ conspiracy by which
the big Hollywood producers have blocked attempts to
show “Salt of the Earth” in theatres around the country.

Student organizations from many of the largest
universities in the country have been demanding the film,
for showing on their campuses. _ -- .

More than 500 students and faculty members at the
University of Kansas gave “Salt of the Earth” hearty
applause‘ when it was shown at the Governmental Re-

search Center there.

The Student Governing'Board
University,
Evanston, Illinois, chose the film
for showing during Constitu-
tional Liberties Week in Febru-
ary. After 1100 students and
faculty members had seen———and
cheered——the movie, an attorney
for the Illinois Branch, Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union, spoke
about the conspiracy to prevent
the film from being shown in
Chicago theaters. He said:
“Your birthright is being taken
from you by.the boycott of this
film by the projectionists.” (He
was referring to the I.A.T.S.E.,
which has fronted for the big
Hollywood producers in the con-
spiracy to suppress the movie).
At the University of Chicago,
the movie was shown twice un-
der sponsorship of the Student’s
Representative Party. Sixteen
hundred students. saw it; an-
other 300 were turned away.

and determined.
All contracts in Canada will be
. re-opened this year with a View
to bringing additional gains to our
members. In the light of economic ‘
developments in the labour-man-
gagement area this past year, it is
quite obvious that 1955 bargain-
ing will be most difficult.

The employers have a l r e a d y
made it clear that every possible
obstacle will be placed in the path
of continued progress for labour.

This decision of industry has
been‘ laid down despite the fact
that industry generally, and es-
pecially the most‘ important sec-
tions of our industry, show high- ‘ ‘
eié pgofits in 1954‘and ‘indications of further increases for
1 5 . ’

This is particularly so of the nickel and copper sec-

. venfion.

tions of the industry, which employ the majority of our

 :2».-. members in Canada.
Wage increase demands are on the bargaining agenda .

and theentire membership will be mobilized in support
of these wage demands. .,

In addition, of course, our union is determined to win
significant improvements in the "pension plans now in

'  ‘effect, or where there are no pension plans then such

plans will be fought for. ,
Medical, surgical, hospital, insurance and other wel-
fare provisions must be improved and already the mem-
. bership has expressed its determination to achieve these
gains.

Labour Unity. Co-operation

SECONDLY, our Union in Canada, having already
achieved a substantial measure of ﬁnity and cooperation
with other sections of the labour movement in our coun-
‘try, with special emphasis on the progress made last
‘year, is determined this year to redouble its efforts in
that direction. , 

The fraternal, friendly and cooperative ties now in
effect with all’ levels of leadership and the rank and file
of -many of Canada’s most important unions will be
strengthened. ' .

The role our union played in support of the major
strikes of other unions during 1954 has laid a firm founda-

-  .~ tion for the future.

Labour unity is vitally necessary as the source of

1 "1 strength for the working class to be successful in their

economic and political struggles. It is the key to victory
Pin all our fights for wages, jobs, democratic rights, secu-
rity and peace. 5 "
Our work in the legislative and political field will be
greatly enhanced as a result of the projected autonomy
of the Canadian section of our International Union.
Fraternal relations with unions in other countries,
.. by means of exchange visits as undertaken by Brothers
King and Solski and in other ways, will also be developed
much more fully. In this sphere of activity it is unde-
niable that, because the Canadian leadership as well as
membership appreciated the difficult position of our un-

i 9 ion in the United States through the restrictive legisla-

'tion in that country, our activities were curtailed to a
. significant. degree. .

The urgency of re-establishing close relations with

the trade union movement of the rest of the world did not

‘receive due regard because of the situation prevailing in

the United States. ’ 1

With the autonomy of the Canadian section of our

‘ Union we are confident that all these necessary and bene-
ficial matters will receive -the attention they must have.
This will react not only to the advantage of the Canadian
membership, but also to our members in the United

. 0 States.
