borrowed Yaweh from other tribes is quite
certain. ’

“Assuming that Yaweh was primitively a
nature god,” continues the Encyclopedia
Britannica in the article quoted from.
“scholars in the 19th century discussed the
question over what sphere of nature he
originally presided. According to some he
was the god of consuming ﬁre, * * * others
recognized him a storm god, * * * the thun-
der is the voice of Yaweh, the lightning his
arrows, the rainbow his bow.”

To this might be added that the smell of
blood is his particular delight.

Dr. Morris of New York turns to biology
to ﬁnd out what causes the “deﬁcient brain
development” of the Prussian Kaiser and
his junkers. He would do well to turn to
the Bible, that these war-lords accept from
cover to cover as their guide, and ﬁgure up

'how much it had to do in inﬂuencing the

biological make—up of the deﬁcient brain
that howls itself hoarse about ME und Gott
—the same “Gott” that bled to death the en-
tire Amalekite population.

In no other country on earth is the Bible
doctrine pumped into the people as it is in
Germany. Every inspired insanity that
teaches submission to tyrants‘ is taught in
schools and, churches. Children are taught

reverence for the Kaiser and his God along

with their alphabet. “Be ye subject unto
the powers that be, for the powers that be
are ordained of God.” is translated into the

German Bible as “Be ye subject unto the

Kaiser, for the Kaiser is ordained of God.”
And why not? Isn’t the Kaiser one of the
powers—in fact, one of the leading ones———
that is referred to by St. Paul? If he isn’t,
then who is? Catholic priests and Lutheran
parsons vie with each other in hammering
this stuff into the heads of Sunday School
children. It forms the most prominent part
of their religious lessons. As the state sup-
ports both creeds, and pays the salaries of
both priests and parsons, this could hardly
be expected to be otherwise. And the teach-
ers in the secular schools, drawing their pay

T and inspiration from the same source, keep

teaching this servility to the growing gen-
eration until in their mind’s eyes the Kaiser
looks just as much like his Gott as his Gott
looks like the Kaiser. .The resemblance
really is remarkable. But what gets me is
how anybody can learn to admire either.

I doubt if. they actually do. Ithink if the
Kaiser-worshipers and the Jehovah—wor-

shipers could honestly and fearlessly an-,

alyze their feelings they would ﬁnd that it’s
fright, and not fondness, that controls them.

 

J .

People do'not kneel and kissithe dust thru i

love. They may cod themselves into think-
ing it’s love, and call it adoration. but
scraped of its sanctity it’s a case offear.

“Vous avez peur! Vous avez peur, Vous
Allerfiands!” (Yo'u are afraid! You are
afraid, you Germans!) cried the French So-
cialist, Herve, at the International Socialist
Congress at Stuttgart, in 1907, when, alone
of all the delegates present, the German del-
egates refused to endorse a general strike if
war was threatened between the European
countries; and the subsequent action of the
German majority Socia1ists—that‘is, if they
can be called Socia1ists———testiﬁes to Herve’.s
indictment. "In the words 'of»Rosa Luxem-
burg, they “followed Von Hindenburg in-
steadof Marx.”

Well has Thomas Jefferson described
Jehovah of the tyrants: “A being of terriﬁc
character-—-cruel, vindictive, capricious and
unjust.” And Robert Blatchford asks: “Is
this unspeakable monster, Yaweh, the
Father of Christ?” No—-—as well insult the
memory of the gentle prophet of human
brotherhood by declaring that a Caesar be-
got him. For centuries before thetime of
Christ the Jews had forgotten the tribal
god that Moses borrowed. The Adonai——
the Father of All of Isaiah and Jesus-——was
in no way connected with the Yaweh of sac-
riﬁce and slaughter. It remained for the
fourth century priests of Constantine to
drag him into the limelight, and embody
him in their creed; and the history of Chris-
tiandom, as Christless as can possibly be
imagined, discloses the effect this faith has
had on humanity. No wonder inquiring
‘minds are asking, Is Christianity a failure?
It is——the kind we have. The dynamic
power to sweeten and save the race—The
Brotherhood of Man-—the pearl of the re-
jected Jesus, is trodden under the feet of
nineteen centuries of swine.

Paradoxical as it may appear, it remained
for a modern materialist, Fredrich Wilhelm
Nietzsche, to unwittingly interpret the es-
sence of orthodox Christianity. He was the
son of a Lutheran pastor,~ who perceived
when a mere youth the true signiﬁcance of
the teachings of Jesus. Born of generations
of thought that declared that Might is
Right, Nietzsche, alarmed at the possibility
of Jesus’ revolutionary doctrines iﬁnally
penetrating the minds of the masses, vio-
lently assailed the entire religious environ-
ment of his day. He bitterly attacked Ger-
many’s master composer, Richard, Wagner,
for his revolutionary attitude. The only

way to permanently establish the power of
the strong was to nip in the bud any ap-
pearance of humaneness; and in the faith
of Christ, paganized though it be, and in
the spirit of proletarian revolt, he detected
the bud that might at last bloom into a
ﬂower. So he brutally taught the “master”
morality, and called upon the “over-man”
to “ruthlessly trample under foot the servile
herd of the weak, degenerate and poor in
spirit.”

It is a sad commentary on the depravity

of some minds that the teachings of Nietz—-

sche took any root at all. Its alleged vir-
tues are those of a vu1ture+its culture that
of a cannibal. And yet it was a sweet
morsel to the sodden swelldom of Germany
—and was quite relished by some of mad
ambition that lived in other lands.
that all that will be left of Nietzsche, when
the war for democracy is over, will be a
bad-smelling memory. And yet, as stated,
he unwittingly upheld the God of Moses,

I think '

and the Kaiser, and the Czar, and all who
believe and practice brute might. ,
Nietzsche was a ﬁtting representation of

. the savage instincts that still survive. With

all the violence of his pen he was a mental
defect. He died hopelessly insane. So also
shall perish the last vestige of autocracy,
the last remnant of a crazy theology, and
the crazy social system it upholds.

At the hour of this writing, warming and
freshening the veins of vine and limb, paint-
ing and perfuming the ﬂowers, nurturing the
corn and fruits, broods the overﬂowing
Spirit of Life, bringing a harvest in answer
to Labor——not to fear, or ﬂattery, or prayer.
The feathered folk are singing as they nestle‘
and nourish their young; the tribes of fur
are gamboling in forest and glen as they
hear the call of ages; none on their knees to
idols of earth or sky ;——none, save Man, the
trembling terror of his own superstition——
the pitiable prostrate before altarsv and
thrones—-the suppliant servant of myths and
masters.

A RATHER DELICATE SUBJECT

T’S every one to his own taste, and it’s.

~nobody’s particular business, but the

A custom of some adult, bewhiskered males
to embrace and kiss each other when they
chance to meet seems as about as unseemly
and unrelishable a habit as can possibly be
imagined. Tradition says it had its origin
among the early Christians, the holiest men
of whom abjured all familiarity with the
fair sex, viewing them as the source of
all the sin and suffering that afflicts the race.
The men thus regenerated and sanctiﬁed be-
came a sort of a mutual admiration sect of
sexless saints, and tried to satisfy the nat-
ural sex attraction byfondly admiring each
other——or at least pretending to do so. Their
stomachs became strong enough to enjoy
kissing each other in the whiskers, in lieu
of the delightfully delicious real thing. I
believe it was Dean Swift that wondered at
the bravery of the man that ﬁrst ate an oys-
ter; but I thinkthe belt belongs to the ﬁrst
monk that threw his arms about the neck of
another v monk, puckered his lips, and
smacked the ticklish, tangled hair that over-
spread his lips, chin and cheeks. Even if
the kissee was shaved, the sensation was
about as pleasing as kissing a sheet of sand-
paper. .

Of course, it is all right for a boy to kiss
his father or brother, but if that boy is
normal, when he passes his adolescence,
those lips of his will yearn to touch the soft,

sweet lips, curtained by the radiance from

. half—closed, winsome eyes, or the velvety’
cheeks from which no scratchy- bristles;

sprout. This is Nature’s age-long call to love

and life, as beautiful as the “flowers that '

bloom in the Spring,” and as gladdening as
sparkling wine; but the kiss of a pair of‘un-
shaven masculines !——honest, doesn’t it make
the goosepimplescreep to think of it?

Not, as I say, that it’s anybody’s partic-
ular business if grown-up men want to kiss
each other. Whatever pleasure they can
ﬁnd in it is all theirs. But I really think,
in consideration of the feelings of others,
they should perform the act in some seclud-
ed spot. Like cleaning the teeth, male
kissing should not be pulled off in public
places. The perpetrators of the deed should
be at least as circumspect as the lads and
lassies, and seek some quiet lovers’ lane, or
the mossy cushion in the shadows of the
woods, where the moon alone is witness
of what is going on. There they can be
as mushy as their hearts desire. But to do
it on the streets, and at all hours of the day
—-even when hearty men are on their way
to dine, or, even worse than that, when they
have just fed——shows but little regard for
the conventionalities that those who, no mat-
ter what they may want to do themselves,
conform to out of respect to others.

There are some things—quite a number of
them—that are out of place in public, and
it certainly seems that the rather delicate
subject referred to is one of them,

“On each Edison birthday you could
write pages, every word useful to young
men with ambition and older men try-
ing to explain failure. '

“Many a question Edison answers-

for instance: ,,
“Can you succeed without a college

., education, a_ rich father and much en-

couragement?

“You can, says Edison’s life. _

“Is it possible for a man tied down
to deadly dull routine work to make a
success of himself——without dropping
his job and wandering off to look for
something better, more worthy of his
powers? '

“Yes, answers Edison’s life, it is
possible.

“Edison was tied to a telegraph in-

strument, and his business was to spend
twelve hours a day moving a little key
up and down.
‘ “Did Edison say, ‘Other men are for-
tunate, I am miserable. Here I am a
wage slave, tied to this little piece of
metal. My magniﬁcent brain and strong
body are made a dull slave, to tick the
Morse code day in and day out.’ Edi-
son did not say that.

“Ashe sat there sticking to his job he

_ asked himself, ‘Why can’t I send more

than one message over one wire at the
same time?’

“He knew that electricity traveled so
fast that it could go all the way around
the world seven times in a second, He
knew that no matter how fast his hand

' worked, electricity could get out of the

way in plenty of time.

“So while he sat, and heldqhis job,
not wandering off to ﬁnd somebody to
appreciate his merit, Edison invented
the system that made possible the send-
ing of many messages over one wire.
And that was worth tens of millions.

“What is genius? -

“Edison answers that question well:

‘Genius is 10 per cent inspiration and _ »

90 per cent perspiration.’

“Many young men are willing to
supply the inspiration——-they think they
have it—-—but not much interestedin the

A  for  

N an editorial on Thomas A. Edison’s
seventy-ﬁrstl birthday, Arthur Brisbane,
in the Washington Times, among other

things, said:

 Sweating Frozen Current of the Soul

90 per cent perspiration that goes with “ 

success.”
=c< ac >:< ' >x<

No one would want to depreciate the

merit that belongs to Edison, or belittle the ' ‘

hard-earned success that he has achieved;
but the inference that Arthur Brisbane’s
editorial is__ specially written to convey, viz.:
that any young man-can, if he. is willing
to work up 90 per cent sweat to his 10 per
cent natural ability, become an Edison, or
something else in some other line equally
as luminous, is on a par with the castle in

Spain that says that any or every boy can . .

become President of the United States, if-
they will but diligently apply themselves
to that end. '
According to this logic it’s their own fault

if every, hod-carrier doesn’t evolve into a
classic sculptor, and every printer’s devil
into “the highest salaried editorial writer
in the world,” as the newspapers designate
Arthur Brisbane. All that any ordinary
person has to do is to mix 90 per cent_
perspiration with his 10 per cent inspira-
tion and climb the ladder of fame to the
highest rung. If he hasn’t but 5 per cent
inspiration, then make it 95 per cent perspi-
ration; and if he has no inspiration what-
ever, then perspire the wh_ole 100 per cent.
VVhen at best it’s 9 parts sweat to 1 part

brains, the brains don’t count much any- pl

way. It’s the sweat that does the work.

Any Spring poet, with, say 15 or .20 per i’

cent inspiration, can easily -rank with
Shakespeare by perspiring;8O or 85 per cent.
VVhat is it that keeps the sweltering corn-
hoers and cotton pickers, with their shirts
and overalls soaking with something like
110 proof perspiration, from passing all
competitors in the race to fame and fortune,
is a question that the 90 per cent sweat
economists fail to answer. Also who would
feed and clothe the world, and operate its
railroad and telegraph“ systems, and mine
its minerals, and build its houses, and per-
form all such other ordinary, but really
somewhat useful work, is not disclosed.‘ It
seems fortunate, were .Arthur Brisbane’s
analysis of society true, thatithe vast ma-
jority are too lazy to perspire sufficiently
to make what, is considered a success of
themselves. it *

society if we could; but we can add 90 per

 , gmon horse sense and make this old world

a welcome home for every child born into it,

)and every useful occupation a success.

Thousands with visions in their brains of

‘new inventions, or works of art, or music,

or the drama—embryos of genius, philos-

ophy, science and culture—never escape the_
grind of the mill. As under‘ the chattel-
‘ slave system it was rarely a slave managed

to make a successful ﬂight to freedom, so
under the present arrangement of industry
it is only now and then, even with 90 per
cent perspiration, that an Edison escapes
the ‘bondage to the job. With Poverty the
taskmaster, inﬁnitely more geniuses ﬁll un-
known and unmarked graves than have a
monument built to commemorate their
achievements. Musing in a country church-
yard the English poet inscribed:

Perhaps, in this neglected spot, is laid or
Some heart, once pregnant with celestial
ﬁre; ' ,
Hands that the rod of empire‘ might have
swayed, .
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.

Page:

Chill Penury repressed their noble rage,
And froze the genial currents of the soul.

Full many a gem, of purest ray serene,

The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean‘

"bear; '
Full many a‘-ﬂower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

That a few, in spite of “chill penury,”
have managed, with 90 per cent perspira-

 

tion-—-mixed largely,with luck——to give ex- ,

pressiontto the “celestial ﬁre” that inspired
them, and have «thereby added to the
world’s storehouse of knowledge, is but a
harbinger of the many that would appear,
bringing ever greater knowledge, if the per-
centage of perspiration were reduced, and
the element of chance” eliminated. The gems
“of purest ray serene,” the ﬂowers that are
“born to blush unseen,” will be brought
forth from the “dark, unfathomed caves,”
will be rescued from the “desert air,” when
the Ocean of Want and the Desert of De-
spair exist no more. That Man has pro-
duced rare examples of genius even tho
handicapped by abnormal industrial condi-
tions, is but the shadow of the glory that
is his heritage once he is made industrially
free. “Chill penury” will no more repress
his “noble rage,” and “the genial current”
of his soul will not be frozen so hard as to
take 90 per cent sweat to thaw it out——and
even that, in most cases, failing to make
it melt. W

SNAKE BITES AND SIN

H-E Michigan dry law, that recently
went. into operation, prohibits “the
manufacture, sale, or importation of

alcoholic beverages, only for medicinal, me-
chanical and sacramental purposes.” The
laws in other dry states are about the
same. '

If you want a drink in a bone "dry locality
you must suffer from either a snake bite
or sin.

If it’s a snake bite, you may make a
hurry-up call on a doctor and get a pre-
scription before you swell beyond all hope;
but if it’s sin you have to wait until com-
munion Sunday. That’s the law—a sort of
a cross between fanaticism and fetishism.

The fanatic says it is wicked to drink red
wine for your stomach’s sake—-the fetish-
man says it is a saving grace to drink it
for your soul’s sake. What is bad for the
earthly goose is good for the heavenly
gander. The sumptuary saint is a prohibi-
tionist until he bumps up against his ‘plan
of salvation, part of which is to drink the

blood and body of a sacriﬁced savior.

That the liquors of the present day, in-
cluding the wines, are mostly vile decoc-
tions put on the market by rectiﬁers whose
only religion is the dollar, doesn’t seem to
worry the divines whoa damn a glass of mild
beer that never went through the mysteries
of a rectiﬁer’s laboratory. Stuff with a
squirt of strychnine, ﬂavored with drugs
and colored with chemicals, serves all right
for sacramental purposes.

It’s perfectly wonderful, isn’t it?,
I admit that distilled liquors, and also
strong wines, are bad enough at their best

as beverages. They should only be taken
as medicine. But the liquors of today are

adulterated abominations; and theliquors.

of tomorrow, when we all go bone dry, are
going to be worse than the ones we have.
Revenue taxes and high license, since the
Civil War, have produced the adulterated
abominations; and prohibition will go it
one stronger and produce the worse than
those. As the competitive system, instead
of being the life of trade is the life of crime,

so prohibition, instead of being the life of ..

sobriety, is the life of bootleggers. And as
the criminal has his kit of tools-to do his
burglarizing, so the bootlegger has his kit
of tools to make his booze. Law never pro-
hibited crime. The jails and penitentiaries
are proof of this. And law can never pro-
hibit the making and selling of s_ome sort of
stimulant.

What, then, is the remedy? Do away
with the proﬁteering system, and inaugu-
rate an industrial democracy. Give all the
people an equal opportunity to amply pro-
vide for themselves, to live lives free from
drudgery and fear of the morrow, to build
attractive homes amidst attractive sur-
roundings, and they will soon become too
happy to Want to get drunk. Even their
souls will become so sweet and clean that
no fair-minded God will expect them to‘ take
a penitential nip.

The big snake that drives to strong drink
is the nerve-racking social system of worry
and want; and the sin that calls for some-
thing to repent with is the _ﬁlth that this
social system piles on the soul.

Inherited From the Wild

LL domesticated animals were once
wild. This includes man. “The dog
is a civilized wolf.” Man is a civilized

anthropoid ape. All fruits, ﬂowers, vege-
tables and cereals have been cultivated
from the wild. The varieties we now have
of these,’ like the varieties of domestic
animals, have been obtained by crossing
the strain, by cultivation and care, by
more hospitable surroundings. The most
civilized and cultured men of today are far
removed from their ape ancestors. So are
the most civilized and cultured dogs far re-
moved from, their wolf ancestors. Really.
there is almost, if not quite, as great a dis-
tinction between the civilized and affection-
ate St. Bernard or Collie and their wild wolf
ancestors, as there is between the highest
order of man and his wild ape ancestors.
And one would hardly recognize the wild
rose’in the American Beauty, or the sour
wild crab in the luscious Jonathan or Belle
Flower apple. And yet all animals, fruits
and ﬂowers descended from the wild stock,
and s=till'carry with them the marks of that
descent.

Nature is a wonderful artiﬁcer, and is
continually changing old organs, or replac-

ing them with new, in thebodies of her chil-
dren, as new environments and conditions
require. The study of these changes and
growths is the most interesting, as well as
inspiring, pursuit the student of Nature can
follow. We learn here that man derived
his talents of creating and inventing things
from the Mother that bore him;-that his
mind, if left free, receives messages from the.
mind of the Universe. This study dates
back to the time of the Greek philosophers,
whose light and knowledge were trampled
under foot to make way for the darkness-
and ignorance of the Church of Rome. In
his ﬁrst book of Satires, Horace, the Roman
poet (born B. C. 65), wrote:

“As soon as animals crept forth on the
ﬁrst lands, a speechless and degraded crowd,
they battled for the acorn and for their lairs
with claws and ﬁsts, then with clubs, and at
length with arms, which afterwards practice
had made; until they learned to use words
by which to indicate vocal sounds and
thoughts, and to use names.” .

“In the struggle for life,” writes Moore,
“species are continually displacing each
other, continually driving each other out of
one set of surroundings into another set,

 

 

,. ~  .._.

‘II/Vhen alspecies  driven out of one set of
” surroundings to which it is ﬁtted into an-

other set different from the ﬁrst, it is very

; likely to have some‘ organs that are left over

and not needed in the new environment.

 On the other hand, it will probably need

some organs which it does not have. Now.
it IS possible for it to make over an organ
which it does not need into one that it does
need, somewhat as our mothers used to
transform a coat which we did not need into

~ a waistcoat or a pair of trousers which we

did need.” —

“In the struggle for life” the “species are
continually displacing each other, continual-
ly driving each other out of one set of sur-
roundings into another set.” The race does
not, as it were, lift itself up by its bootstraps
from a lower condition to a higher. It is
driven there. It generally, so far as the ma-
jority is concerned, resists great social
changes. Its instincts ever make it cling to

present surroundings, no matter what at-

tractions of a change may be placed before
its eyes. All the glories of a I far-away
heaven fail to cause believers to be in any
hurry to leave this world. It is only when
present surroundings become unbearable
that the race is reconciled to risk a forward
step. And even then, and for ages to come,
it retains in body and mind useless organs
and instincts inherited from the surround-
ings it has left. That is, useless in a physio-
logical sense; as a source of information, tell-
ing us of our~origin, and, to the wise, giving
promise of a greater future, these left-over
organs and instincts are an inexhaustible
storehouse of unfolding knowledge. It is

«well, even tho at times it becomes clogged

from our having assumed an erect position,
thatthe vermiform appendix still remains.
It is the revealed book that informs us that
man once Went on all fours.

In the chapter 011 Evidences of Organic
descent‘, found in vol. v. (Biology), of The
Science—I-Iistory of the Universe (Current
Literature Publishing Co., New York), a
work compiled from the investigations and
discoveries of modern scholars, we read:
 “In the ﬁshes, the lowest class of verte-
brates,‘ gills are the organs of breathing.
Wiatentaken into the mouth is ejected. from
the throat through the gill—slits, which are
lined with delicate vascular membranes.
Blood circulating thru these membranes ab-

' sorbs oxygen from the water and gives off

carbon dioxide gas. Thus in the ﬁshes the

..gills_.play the part performed by lungs in

higherforms, and are essential formsthru-
out life.” Passing up the scale of animal life,

s

THE ME[LT1NG‘PoTt   , 15

amphibian embryos develop gill-‘slits and
they are present and functionally active for
a few days in the early life of certain tad-
poles. In all amphibians (vertebrate ani-
mals whose young have gills and which are
equally at home on land or in the water)

the slits close soon and the fully developed '

frogs and salamanders do not use them for
breathing. Certain amphibians have ‘gills
thruout life, but they are not the gills cor-
responding to those of ﬁshes.

“Now, in interpreting these facts, it A

should be noted that the embryos of the
higher classes,reptiles, birds and mammals,
never have access to water and yet in every
species Whose development is known gill-
slits are present in the embryos. For ex-
ample, in a chick of three to ﬁve days’ incu-
bation there are four slits on the side of the
neck. Likewise there areiseveral gill—slits in
human embryos of three to ﬁve weeks’ de-
velopment. In all reptiles, birds and mam-
mals the gill—slits, however, are temporary;
they serve no function and close long before
hatching or birth. The only interpretation
which appeals to the biologist as reasonable
is that gill—slits in the higher vertebrates
are reminiscences of ancestral history and,
originally ﬁsh organs, they appear regularly
in the ﬁsh-like stage of every embryo of
higher forms which. in their development
pass thru stages comparing in a general way
to the adults of lower forms.”

Man did not start in a Garden of Eden.
V\/ith all other life, he came from the sea.

To further. quote from the foregoing au-
thority:

“There are dozens and dozens of similar
cases known to occur in the embryology of
vertebrates. The notochord, which is the
dorsal stiffening axis in the lowest verte-
brate (amphioxus), appears in the embryos
of all higher forms. In them it is purely tem-
porary and disappears as the backbone is de-
veloped around it. The lungs of amphibia and
higher forms develop in the embryo identi-
cally with the air-bladder of ﬁshes. In the
embryonic development of man and other
mammals three pairs of kidneys are formed,
only one remaining at birth. The ﬁrst kid-
neys (pronephros) develop in the stage
when gills and other structures correspond
to a ﬁsh-embryo stage, and in some of the
lowest ﬁshes this pair becomes the perma-
nent kidneys. The second kidneys (me-
sonephros) correspond to , an amphibian-

s reptilian stage, and this pair persists thru-

out_.life in the amhibia, in the embryos of
Wh1Cl‘1 the ﬁrst kidneys are temporarily
present. The third kidneys (metanephros)

development and remain thruout life. In '

the ‘higher forms (such as man) the ﬁrst

i gand second kidneys are absolutelyiuseless.
,The only reasonable explanation of this fact i

is tha-t,the appearance of the ﬁrst kidneys
in amphibian embryos and of the ﬁrst and
second in mammalian embryos (of Which
man is the highest order) is due to this
repetition or recapitulation of ancestral his-
tory.” i

In the words of Le Conte: _

“By the law of heredity each generation
repeats the form and structure of the ‘previ-
ous, and in the order in which they succes-
sively appeared.iBut there is a tendency for
each successively appearing character to ap-
pear a little earlier in each successive gen-
eration; and by this means time is left over
for the introductionof still new characters.
Thus, characters which were once adult are
pushed back to the young, and then still
back to the embryo, and thus place and time
are made for each generation to push on
'still higher.” ’

The only naturalist of note who refused
to accept the overwhelming evidences of or-
ganic descent was Jean Louis Rodolphe
Agassiz. He appears to have put a spiritual
interpretation on the material manifesta-
tions indicating man’s evolution from the
lower animal life. He says: '

“If we now pass to the highest type of
the Animal», Kingdom, the Vertebrates, there
is no lack of evidence_to show the identity
in their ‘mode of development, as well as the
striking resemblance of the young in their
earliest stages of growth. The young ﬁsh,
the young reptile, the young bird, the young
mammal, resemble one another to an aston-
ishing degree, while they have not one fea-
ture in their mode of growth which recalls
either the Articulate, the Mollusk, or the
Radiate. It ‘is, therefore, not true, tho so
often stated, that in their development the
higher animals pass successively thru the
condition of all the lower ones; while it is

emphatically true that in each of the four "

great branches of the Animal Kingdom
there is a common mode of development.
It is equally true that in certain features the
higher classes of each branch in their
younger condition recall the characteristic,

features of the lower ones, tho each class‘
has its own structural character, and,e-ach,

diverges from the common starting point, ~
“Indeed, modern Embryology leads, at

once to the consideration of the most, occult A
problem, as to the origin of anima,ls,i“sjugge\i

gested by these comparisons. 

"these resemblances mean, frornii-:‘fl:.so

which we shrink as‘ uninaturalaiid even are-_.s\p

ition upon them, and believe that evengrnans

himself has been gradually developed out of ‘ A

a ﬁsh, they are repugnant‘ to our better na-
ture. But looked at in their intellectual‘sig-

niﬁcance, they truly reveal the unity of the"  ,

organic conception. of which man himself
is a part, and mark not only the incipient
steps in its manifestation, but also, with
equal distinctness, every phase in its gradual
realization. They mean that when the ﬁrst
ﬁsh was called into existence, the Verte-

brate type existed as a whole in the creative 
thought, and the ﬁrst expression of it em-

braced potentially all the organic elements
of that type, up to man himself. To me the
fact that the embryonic form of the highest,
vertebrate recalls in its earlier stage the
ﬁrst representatives, of its type in geological
times and its lowest representatives at the
present day, speaks only of an ideal rela-
tion, existing not in the things ‘themselves,
but in the mind that made the . A l V
“It is true that the naturalist is sometimes
startled at these transient resemblances of
the young among the higher in animals in
one type to the adult condition of the lower
animals in the same type; but it is also true
that he ﬁnds each one of the primary divi-

sions of the ‘Animal Kingdom bound to its

own norm of development, which is abso-
lutely distinct fromthat of all the others; A’
it is also true, that, while hetperceives cor-
respondences between the early phases of
the higher animals and the mature state of

the lower ones, he never sees any one of,
them diverge in the slightest degree from

its own structural character——-never sees the
lower rise by a shade beyond the level which
is permanent for the group to whichfit be-
longs——never sees the higher ones step short
of their ﬁnal aim, neither in the mode or the
extent of their transformation.” a

In commenting upon the interpretation of A

animal development" offered by" Agassiz,
Caroline E. Stackpole, Tutor in Biology in
the Teachers’ College,iColumbia University,
says: ‘ i an ,
“Thus did Agassiz reject the t‘heory_ofi

‘Agassiz died before the discovery of disease
germs, bred from eggs deposited by"
pre-existing living organisms in-putrid mat-
ter. Would he have used the comparisons
the makes to include the typhus bacteria, or
malaria germs? VVorms appear in the in-
testines of humans, as well as in other ani-
» mals; but this does not affect in any way
the evidences of man’s development thru
organic descent and natural selection. The
; world literally swarms with parasitical life
and annulose animals.

T 0 put a spiritual signiﬁcance on all the
mevidences of man’s gradual development
from the lower animal life, and to “shrink”
from any other conception as “revolting,”
is but the reﬂection of false religious teach-
, ings, by which the race has ﬂattered itself
as being a special creation in the image of
God. That Louis Agassiz was the son of a
Swiss Calvinist preacher doubtless had
much to do with the repugnance he ex-
presses at the ﬁndings of modern science.
While an earnest student of Nature, he
seems to have been unable to completely
break the bondage of superstition, even in
the face ofthe overwhelming evidences that
confronted him.

Not many years ago (and since the death;
of Agassiz, which occurred in 1873), there
was found, among theaborigines of Aus-
tralia, who are representative of the lowest
formVof human life still on earth, a woman‘

perfect Paradise, and that they were plunged

“Assuming that the theory of special cre- .

us to anticipate the form or method of the

The Dimple Vaccination

Doctor

HE City Health Officer of Spokane,
\Vash., Dr. John B. Anderson, has dis-
covered something in the vaccination

line that does away with its unsightliness,
if not its sting._ A press report says that
“he has been making punctures instead of

' scratches whenhe vaccinates people, and as

a result has been raising dimples instead of
scars on Spokane arms. A local newspaper

discovered it and proclaimed him broadcast .

as the dimple maker, and now the doctor
is smiling because pretty girls no longer
balk at being vaccinated, nor ask to have it
done in a place where it can’t be seen.”

If this doesn’t start a boom in the Vaccina-
tion business I’ll miss my guess. All a bud-
ding M. D.rneed do is to hang out a shingle,
“Dimple Vaccination Doctor,” and wait for
the rush. A smallpox scare in town will
almost be welcomed by the pretty girls. No
need of a health officer coming around to
ask them when they werervaccinated last,
or whether it took good and plenty. They
will take no chance on the last cowpox virus

medical profession, as well as a pleasing
one for the pretty girls. It will not only do
away with the balking at being vaccinated

on the part of the latter, but alsothe difﬁ- A

culty, these days when fashion draws nearer
and nearer the Garden of Eden style, on the
part of the M. Ds. to locate “a place where
it can’t be seen.” Once the dimple vaccina-
tion process becomes thoroly established
it is likely to outclass the tattooing punc-
tured on the dusky altogether of the Tahi-
tian belle. Counting the dimples on the
dimpled maids may yet ﬁll the vacant hours
and vacant minds of the young college grad-
uates whose papas pay the bill.

President Wilson Stands

by the Russian Republic

HE Washington correspondent of the
St. Louis Star, David Lawrence, says
that “America isn’t going to abandon
Russia. On the contrary,_ there has now
been organized a movement, unofficial in
character, but the scope and purposes of
which have the indorsement of President
\Vilson, that will attempt to bring moral and
material aid to the struggling democracy
in as effective a manner-as circumstances
will permit.”

President Wilson said recently, in an ad-
dress to Congress, that “the treatment ac-
corded Russia by_her sister nations in the
months to come will be the acid test of their
good will, of their comprehension of her
needs as distinguished from their own inter-
ests, and of their intelligent and unselﬁsh
sympathy.” T

Among the radical supporters of democ-
racy that are on the Executive Committee
of the league are Lincoln Steffens, Henry
L. Slobodin, Col. William B. Thompson,
and Frederick C. Howe. -

And who is there whose spirit does not
at times droop, even as the body becomes
fatigued? And yet the robust spirit arises
in strength again, just as the healthy body
arises from its rest,_ and tosses to the world
the toast running at the close of the melody:

“But send round the bowl; while a relic
of truth
Is in man or in woman, this prayer
shall be mine-
That the sunshine of love may illumine
our youth,
And the moonlight of friendship con-
sole our decline.”

And these cheering lines:

“Let Fate do her worst, there are relics
of joy,
Bright dreams of the past, which she
cannot destroy;
VVhich come in the night-time of sor-
row and care,
And bring back the features that joy
used to wear. T
Long, long be my heart with such mem-
ories fill’d!
Like the vase, in which roses have once
been distill’d—
You may break, you may shatter the
vase, if you will,
But the scent of the roses will hang
round it still.”

The world is not a “fleeting show,” it is
not “for man’s illusion given.” It is rather
a ﬁtting school for man’s’ development

given. Nature is not a swindler. She is in- '

structive, not illusive. She is the Great
Teacher, even tho her lessons at times seem
hard. When we persist in going the wrong
way she goes after us with a club to
straighten us out.

I know it seems tough when the innocent
get hammered along with the guilty, but it
can’t be helped. Nature isn’t a special provi-
dence picking up pets in answer to prayer.
When a conﬂagration starts it takes every-
thing combustible in its way. The ﬂames
do not pass up a church in order to swallow
a saloon. It doesn’t pay to complain of any
recklessness displayed by the conﬂagration.
The thing to do is to learn how to prevent
another one. There was something rotten
in the construction of the town. Too much
tinder had been piled in close proximity.
Next time, or at least sometime, we will con-
struct better buildings.

A madman, dressed in automatic author-
ity, runs amuck and shatters the vases
wherein our roses, few tho they were,
had been distilled. But he cannot destroy
the perfume. We will fashion another vase.
larger and more beautiful than the one
broken, and tenderly ﬁll it with more roses;
and we will set it up over the ruins; and
there will arise more sweetness than ever,
that cannot be destroyed. Like the better
buildings in the consumed town, so will we
arrange society that madmen cannot run .
amuck again.

Such is the decree of Nature. And we will
go on dreaming brighter and brighter
dreams, and making realities of them, until
we all may live, so

“That the sunshine of love may illumine
our youth,
And the moonlight of friendship console
our decline.”

The Hohenzollern Highwaymen

F Karl Marx were living today he would
I support every means that could possibly
be employed to crush the military power

of Prussia that forced the murderous treaty
upon the Bolshevik Republic of Russia.
The Marx who, when an exile in London
for proclaiming his message of democracy
——both political and industrial———in junker-
ruled and junker-cursed Germany, stood
steadfastly and uncompromisingly for the
American war against chattel slavery,
would, were he living, stand just as stead-
fastly and uncompromisingly for war

against the Hohenzollern highwaymen, the
ravishers of Russia, who, drunk with the
dream of despotic dominion, would banish
political and industrial democracy into a
starless and hopeless night of years to come.

There are many wrongs in this world to
be righted; but not one can be touched if
a despotism in covenant with death be not
destroyed. I stand, and will remain to my
last breath, upon the principles of Interna-
tionalism and Socialism; I fully realize the
age-long obstructions and prejudices and
petty tyrannies that are in the path that

 

 

 

 

ing upon them) is drawn fro_rifiVi:.the7fiSun. « _

“A few years ago, when the;%Suﬂ‘.?:;.Was af-
ﬁrmed to be the source of life, nin&g.out of
ten of those who are alarmed Qby the form
which this assertion has latterly assumed
would have assented, in a general way, to
its correctness. Their assent, however, was
more poetic than scientiﬁc, and- they were
by no means prepared to see a rigid niechan—
ical signiﬁcation attached to their words.
This, however, is the peculiarity of modern
conclusions; that there is no creative energy
whatever in the vegetable or animal organ-
ism, but that all power which we obtain
from the muscles of man and animals, as
much. as that which we develop by the com-
bustion of wood or coal, has been produced
at the Sun’s expense,

“To most minds, however, the energy of
light and heat presents itself as a thing to-
tally distinct from ordinary mechanical
energy. Either of them can nevertheless
be derived from the other. Wood can be
raised by friction to the temperature of ig-
nition; while by properly striking a piece
of iron a skillful blacksmith can cause it to
glow. Thus, by the rude agency of his hain—
mer, he generates light and heat. This ac-
tion, if carried far enough, would produce
the light and heat of the ‘Sun. In fact, the
Sun’s light and heat have actually been re-
ferred to the fall of meteoric. matter upon
his surface; and whether the Sun is thus
supported or not, it is perfectly certain that
he might be thus supported. If then, solar
light and heat can be produced by the im-
pact of dead matter, and if from the light
and heat thus produced we can derive the
energies which we have been accustomed
to call vital, it indubitably follows that vital
energy may have a proximately mechanical
origin.

"In what sense, then, is the Sun to be re-
garded as the origin of the energy derivable
from plants and animals? Let us try and
give an intelligible answer to this question.

bution of the work expended in raisingiti

“In precisely this sense is all the energy-of,
plants and animals (which we receivp ii'{i;..’cil;ie“
way of food) the parceling out and 
tion. of a power originally exerted by Wgfie;

Sun. In the case of water, the source of tl"'fé' '

power consists in the forcible separation of
a quantity of the “liquid from a low level
of the Earth’s surface, and its elevation to
a higher position, the power thus expended
being returned by the water in its descent.
ln the case of vital phenomena, the source
of power consists in the forcible separation
of the atoms of compound substances by the
Sun. We name the force which draws the
water earthward ‘gravity,’ and that which
draws atoms together ‘chemical affinity ;’ but
these different names must not mislead us
regarding the qualitative identity of the two
forces. They are both atrractions; and, to
the intellect, the falling of carbon atoms
against oxygen atoms is not more difficult
of conception than the falling of water to
the earth.

“The building up of the vegetable, then, is
effected by the Sun, through the reduction
of chemical compounds. The phenomena of
animal life are more or less complicated re-
versals of these processes of reduction. We

eat the Vegetable. and we breathe the ox_v— ‘‘

gen of the air; and in our bodies the oxygen,
which had been lifted from the carbon and
hydrogen by the action of the Sun, again
falls toward them, producing heat and de-
veloping animal forms. Thru the most com-
plicated phenomena of vitality this law
runs; the vegetable is produced while a
weight rises, the animal is produced while
a weight falls. c

“But the question is not exhausted here.

descent, but the form of the motion (whetl1—

of organic matter (the life forces), then,
“different in kind from those of inorganic
 matter? The philosophy of the present day
negatives the question. It is the compound-
ng equally to the inorganic, that constitutes
the mystery and the miracle of vitality. Ev-
ery portion of every animal body may-be re-
duced. to purely inorganic matter. A per-
yfect reversal of this process of reduction
would carry us from the inorganic to the or-
ganic; and such 3. reversal is at least con-
,-ceivable. “The tendency, indeed, of modern
‘science is to break down the wall of parti-

22 , A THE MELTINGSPOT

I feel that I can say this with much more
conﬁdence since that master mind, to whom
even John Tyndall himself turned for light
in the law of Evolution, Alfred Russel Wal-

lace, co-discoverer with Charles Darwin of_

this law, unhesitatingly declared, before he
died, that the twentieth century would see

the immortality of the soul a demonstrated v

fact. Nor was VVallace alone of the con-
temporaneous nineteenth century school of
scientists, a number of whom are still liv-
ing, who, after long and careful investiga»
tion and study, became fully convinced that

an intelligent spiritual energy is the answer \

to the otherwise “Riddle of the Universe.”
As this conviction, based on overwhelming
evidence, came to Wallace, as well as to
others, some years after the death of Tyndall
(1893), it is at least possible, if not probable,
that the latter, in the face of these evidences,
would have adopted the same view. He
certainly would not have been obliged to
offend his reasoning by accepting the theory
of a spiritual Ego that attracted and con-
trolled the departing and arriving cells, in-
stead of the theory of intelligent, even tho

mortal cells, that created and controlled-
even inspired with thought——an otherwise
unconscious Ego. The question of life is
answered by but two conclusions—— either
Spirit gives expression to otherwise expres-
sionless matter, or expressionless matter—-
including the Sun itself——at some time spon-
taneously brought forth intelligent expres-
sion. This simply reduces itself to the prop-
osition that either an artisan inspired the
bricks into a stately ediﬁce, or the bricks
inspired the artisan to do the work.

The Sun is the source of all life on this
planet, and on" every other planet of the

solar system where life may exist. This can.

readily be admitted. But that does not pre-
clude the presumption that Spirit is the
life—force of the Sun, or of all suns, or, as is
put forth by some astronomers, of a central
Sun, of inestimable magnitude, controlling
the Universe. The discovery of radium
seems sufficient evidence of the existence
of an eternal energy. Well may we exclaim:

“From the bosom of Eternity there shine
celestial guiding stars.”

The Menace of Puritanism

Puritanism is a- religious aberration that
affects weak minds. As these have been
quite plentiful in various parts of the world,
Puritanism at times becomes an epidemic.
The most notorious prophets of Puritanism

were Mohammed and John Calvin. Mo-
hammed managed to scatter the Puritan
bacteria so thick in Turkey that the natives
have never been able to come out of it.
John Calvin nearly did the same in Scot-
land, and would probably have succeeded if
he had been as cute as Mohammed, and
added prohibition to the rest of his religion.
As it was, the Scotch Puritan, whenever the
mania became almost unbearable, could ﬁnd
some relief in Scotch whiskey. This was
denied the Turk, so he gradually degen-
erated to where he is. "Cotton Mather, who
made so strenuous an attempt to ﬁrmly
establish Puritanism in New England, also
overlooked the prohibition prop to bolster
the thing. He thought hanging old women
and Quakers, and making it a crime for a
man to kiss his wife or sweetheart on Sun-

. day, would be enough to make nuts of the

‘community without further sumptuary laws.
The ﬁnal failure of the New England Puri-
tans ‘to perpetuate their religion is one of

 

the saddest parts of church history—that is,
in the minds of live Puritans.

These live ones do not again propose to
make the mistake that their beloved ‘Cotton
made. They realize that their very exist-
ence depends upon chronic dyspepsia. Wine
that “maketh the heart glad,” and beer that
soothes the tired worker, and often aids di-
gestion, won’t do at all in a Puritan land.
Puritanism does not countenance good fel-
lowship. It requires morose minds and sad
thinking. A holy man has no business to be
happy. His thoughts want to dwell on the
everlasting judgment. A bottle of beer may
make him forget for the moment that he is
a lost soul. So the Puritan boat in America
has been launched on the prohibition wave,
and if it lands its crazy cargo on the people,
it is expected that all, in a generation or so,
will appear and act like the sallow Turk,.or
William Jennings Bryan. It’s surely a sad
outlook for those with sane minds and good
digestion, and who esteem it a virtue to
mind their own business, and to grant other
people the right to worship or not worship,
to eat and drink What they think best, and
to go through life singing like a happy hu-
man, or, if they will, spend their days like
a continual funeral.  —

THE MELTING For

Any reputable physician will tell you that
alcoholism is a nervous disease caused by
the uncertainties and ﬁerce strain of our
high—strung, commercialized society. Ner-
vous women give birth to nervous children,
begotten by nervous fathers. Our forebears,
living a more ‘normal life, did not become al-
coholic wrecks, nor do the moderate beer
drinkers of today. In fact beer has a tendency
to relieve the nervous strain, while distilled‘
spirits ﬁre them to worse fury. At the same
time, our forebears, who didn’t know they
had any nerves, drank whisky with apparent
impunity. But the Puritan reeks not of our

abnormal, nerve-straining society. His brain

is dense as a 1obster’s so far as social and
economic questions are concerned. All he
knows is how to look solemn and smell
around for sinners. Incidentally« he has
learned how to make money at the trade.
He has found out that the masses, whose
delight, it appears, is to be humbugged, will
pay to hear him talk. Having soused him-
self with superstition until he has contracted
a constipation of intellect and a diarrhea of
words, he swells up as a saint, and the dear
people really believe he is. Past history
fairly reeks with the muck that crack-
brained bigots have piled on it.

But the making it a crime to brew, buy,
or imbibe a glass of beer isn’t the only card
the Puritans have up their sleeve. Ethi-
opians don't change their color, nor leopards
lose their spots. Already in some prohibi-
tion localities——and even states—a man
caught selling or smoking a cigarette is a
felon. Bills have been introduced in the leg-
islature of Kansas to prohibit the sale and
use of tobacco in any form. Coffee and tea
come next. Sunday closing laws, already
in existence, are but the forerunners of com-
pulsory church attendance. Theaters are
wicked, and dancing leads to hell. The
shadow of the old-time pillories falls on the
public places, and we can again vision the
victims of Puritan bigotry caged, head,
hands and feet. Next comes a holy inquisi-
tion to try, torture and burn or hang here-

_ ties. The ones that prick Lib_er,ty—-“for the
moral welfare of the community ’

only wait
their chance to stab her to death. Scratch a

Puritan and you will ﬁnd a medieval man-'

hunter. Now he is looking down your gullet to
see what you swallow. Next he will be investi-
gating your mind to see what you believe.
The road to Yesterday is still open. The
crowd that trails after the Bryans and Sun-
days are hiking that way. Nation—wide pro-
hibition—then nation—vvide religious intol-

erance——then, GOOD NIGHT!

r i From the Brute to the Brother

“In the vocabulary of the truly enlightened and civilized person,” writes Thomas B.

Gregory, in a recent newspaper article, “there is no such word as ‘foreigner.’

Such a man

knows full well that down at bottom the word is meaningless. He knows that it is his duty
and his privilege to see in every man, regardless of the locality of his birth or residence, a
BROTHER, one whom he is morally bound to treat with justice and with kindness.”

In the progress the race makes towards an enlightened and civilized internationalism

lies the hope of the world.

When Mankind becomes truly enlightened and’ civilized, there will be no such word
as foreigner, no such thing as frontier. ‘

There will be no warring classes, no warring creeds.

The world will be one country, to “do good” the only “religion.”

Fraternity will be the saving faith, Love the Universal God.
Man, that began as a brute, will at last become a BROTHER.

The Mystery of the Human Body T

Depending from the base of
the brain like a berry on its
stalk is a capsule about the size
of a cherry. Tiny and obscure
as this organ is, its derange-
ments may have the most amaz-
ing effects upon the mind and
body. Should it become super-
active, the body may suddenly
shoot up to the stature of a
giant. Should its functions be-
come feeble in childhood, the
victim in old age will retain the
stature and mentality of a 6-
year—old child, along with all
the organic decreptivities of
senility. This gland is called
the pituitary body.

This suggests the fanciful

possibility that ancient legends
asserting the existence of giants
may have had alscientiﬁc basis
in pathology. The Greek Titans
may have been a tribe in which
there was an endemic of thy-
roiditis.. Jack of famous his-
tory possibly clambered up his
beanstalk only to administer the
ﬁnishing stroke to a wretch in
the last stages of acromegaly. At
any rate, in the folklore of all
peoples, there is unanimity in
maintaining that giants once
ranged throughout the earth.
The same fact is true of dwarfs,
who could also be explained
through irregularities of the
ductless glands.

Let me say to young men, this age is weary of the polite and weak camp followers, weary

In the neck are usually four
capsules of the size of apple
seeds. So minute are they that
it was not known until 1891 that
their normal number is four in-
stead of two. But a lesion of
these glands leads swiftly to

_ convulsions, stupor and death.

They are believed to govern the
body’s absorption of calcium,
and are called the parathyroids.

in that time it has been discov-

The pituitary body, the thy-

adrenals belong to that astound-
ing class of organs known as
the ductless glands, the study
of which is today the most
thrilling and absorbing subject
engaging the attention of sur-

inﬂuential upon its chief proc-

Others of the same class,
whose functions are still ob-
scure, are the carotid glands in

scarcely been explored, was
shown some time ago by the
intentness with which the St.
Louis Medical Society heard a

lecture upon the subject by Dr._

George Dock, dean‘ of the medi-
cal school of Washington Uni-
versity, and which forms the
substance of this article, as told
in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Dr. Dock contributed four au-
thoritative chapters on “Dis-

eases of the Ductless Glands”
to Dr. William Osler’s mon-
umental library of “Modern

Medicine.”

The following are given as
among the chief characteristics
of the ductless glands:

1. They control the growth
of bone, not only during the
adolescent period, but after
adulthood has been reached; so
that a giant may develop from
an individual after he has at-
tained his normal growth.

2. They regulate the process
of nutrition, some speeding it
up and others retarding it, so
as to strike a balance between
waste and overgrowth.

3. They regulate the assimi-
lation of sugar, many of the
ductless glands having to do
with the use of this food in the
body.

4. They affect bodily tem-
perature, some elevating it and
others lowering it.

5. They affect the nervous
system by depressing or stim-
ulating it.

6. They regulate the action
of the stomach and bowels.

7. To the pituitary body par-
ticularly is due giantism of all
kinds, as well as many cases of
obesity.

8. To the same organ are due
many forms of dwarﬁsm and
infantilism, ‘the latter being de-
layed mental and physical ma-
turity.

9. Every ductless gland has
a close relation to the functions
of all the others, and each is
easily affected by disease in any
part of the body. Among the
commonest diseases caused by
derangements of these glands
are goiter, exophthalmic goiter,

It is thus seen what universal
supervision is exercised by these
little masters‘ of the body. It
is the cherry-size globule at the
base of the brain which alone
determines whether one is to
be of normal height, or else a
giant or a dwarf. Upon an ap-
ple-size gland in the neck de-
pends whether one is to possess
an active brain or sit in the
mental ‘darkness of total idiocy
——whether one is to belong upon
the human level or descend to
that of a dog or almost to that
of a vegetable.

It was at one time thought
that the ductless, glands func-
tioned by neutralizing poisons
formed in the body. The View

Up to as late as 1873 it was
believed that the thyroid gland
existed for no other purpose
than that of giving the neck a
beautiful shape. Now it is
knovv;n that to lack of thyroid
secretion or to atrophy of the
thyroid gland is due thermon-
strous disease cretinism, which
exists in several deﬁnitecenters
in close geographical connec-
tion with the spheres of en-
demic goiter.

Cretins are usually the.‘ chil-
dren of goitrous parents. They
are from three to ﬁve feet tall,
have short, obese bodies, crook-
ed, weak legs, low foreheads
and prognathous jaws, ﬁat
noses with conspicuous nostrils
and an inelastic, cold skin. They
have thick, blubbering lips and
open mouths from‘which pro-
trude a large tongue. The ab-
domen is pendulous. The hair
is thin and dry, the nails brittle,
the teeth corroded. The men
have no beard. The bones are
incompletely ossiﬁed. To add
to his other afflictions, the cre-
tin is usually deaf and almost
dumb, being able to make only
inarticulate noises. His mental
development is about that of a
trained house dog.

its history.

The simple injection of. an

of a sheep is the medium by
which results no less than mi-
raculous have been obtained in
the treatment of these idiots.
In many cases the effects of
the treatment have become ap-
Loss of

glossy and ﬁne, instead of harsh
and coarse. A new set of teeth,

its appearance. The body be-
comes more shapely. Most im-
portant. of all, cretinous children,
with the help of the thyroid
principle from a sheep’s body,
have in some cases awakened
from their mental torpor and
rapidly caught up with their fel-
lows of the same age in their
studies.

\
Akin to cretinism, but due to
other causes, -is myxedema,

.which often follows an opera-
tion on the thyroid gland, or

is a result of diseases like tuber-
culosis, typhoid, inﬂuenza, pneu-
monia and alcoholism. The
thyroid is reduced to from one-
half to one—fourth of its bulk,
and mental and physical effects
of the most emphatic character
promptly follow. The memory

fails, the will becomes slow and ~

indecisive. There is_a rapid
taking on of fat so that the ab-
domen becomes enormously en-
largcd. In acute cases delirium
and death quickly ensue.

Myxedema was once consid-
ered hopcless. Its average
duration was from. ﬁve to seven
years. In the: meantime the
victim proved an easy prey to
any .intercurrent disease which

, happened to attagk him such as

tuberculosis or pneumonia, or
even to a severe drinking bout.
But with this malady, as with
cretinism, the thyroid treatment
has won brilliant success. Dr.

' Dock’s chapters tell of a wo-

Aman ill for 12 years, bedridden,

deaf, bald, under intense physi-
cal and mental prostration. ‘In

a few weeks her hearing re-

turned, her hair began to grow,

until ﬁnally it fell to her waist, I

and, strangest of all, her mem-
ory awok’e and her mind recov-
ered its former activity.

The peculiarity ‘of the thyroid
gland chemically is that it "se-
cretes an organic compound
with iodine as the main ingre-
dient, thus indicating that the
difference between intelligence
and idiocy, between physical

beauty and physical deformity,‘

may lie in the presence or ab-

sence of a small‘ quantity of,

iodine in the body.

The little pituitary body ap- ’

pears to have the job of regu-
lating the stature.‘ If, through
disease, it becomes morbidly
stimulated into super-activity
the bones, even after their life-
work is normally completed,
will be driven to begin a‘ new
growth and stretch the body to
the size of a giant. The pre-
liminary stages of giantism are
known as acromegaly, which

soon makes it necessary for the-

victim to increase the dimen-
sions of his hat, gloves and
shoes two or three sizes. The
liver, kidneys and heart become
greatly enlarged.

Anemia of the pituitary body
is believed to be one of the
causes of dwarﬁsm. In the
aged victims of this deformity,
says an authority,"“we see on

and apparently the ideas of an

childhood.” ‘

on as one of the surest prophets that have ever spoken to man-
kind. C'onsequently in these, which are undoubtedly the darkest
days the human race has ever known, when denser clouds have never
obscured the sun of happiness, he performs a ﬁtting task, and one
for which we must acknowledge a debt of gratitude, by stating so
clearly those undeniable facts, and using them to reason for the
future of a world which has immeasurably so much more before than
it has behind it.——~]lIetrop0litan Magazine.

Consider the earth in its
origin; at first, a shapeless
n e b u l a becoming gradually
more and more condensed;
next, a globe of ﬁre, of rocks

I _in fusion, whirling for millions

of years through space, with
no other object than that of
forming into a mass and cooling
incandes-
cence which none of our sources
of heat can suggest to us—an
essential, scientiﬁc-‘, absolute
barrenness which may well have
proclaimed itself irremevdiable
and everlasting. Who would

.have thought that from these

torrents of matter in eruption,
which seemed to have destroyed
forever all life or the least germ
of life, there would emerge each
and every form of life itself,
from the greatest, the strongest,
the most enduring, the most
impetuous, the most abundant,
down to the least visible, the
most precarious, the most
ephemeral, the most exiguous?
Who could have dared foresee
that they would give birth to
what-seems so utterly alien to
the liqueﬁed or viscous rocks
and metals that alone formed
the surface, the nucleus, and
the very entity of our globe?
I mean our human intelligence
and consciousness.

Is it possible to imagine a

\ rnoreunexpected evolution and

ending?» What could astonish

us after so great an astonish-

ment, and what are we not
entitled to hope of aworld,
which after being what it was,
has produced what we see

.and what we are? Con-

sidering that_ it started .from
a sort of negation of life, from
integral barrenness, and from

worse than nothing in order to‘

end in us, where will it not end
after starting from ourselves?
If its birth and formation have
elaborated such prodigies, what
pro-digies may not its existence,
its indeﬁnite prolongation, and
its dissolution hold in store?
There are an immeasurable dis-
tance and inconceivable trans-
‘formations between the one
frightful material of the early
days and the human thought of
this moment; and there will
doubtless be a like distance and
like transformations, as difficult
to conceive, between the
thought of this moment and
that which will succeed it in
the inﬁnity; of time.

It seems as if, in the begin-
ning, our earth did not know
what to do with its material and
with its force, which interde-
voured each other. In the vast,
ﬂaming void in which it was
being consumed, it had not yet
the shadow of an object or an
idea; today, it has so many that
our scholars wear out their
lives to no purpose in seeking
them, and_are overwhelemed by
the number _of its mysterious
and inexhaustible combinations.
At that time, it disposed of but
a single force, the. most de-
structive that we know-—ﬁre. If
everything was born of ﬁre,
which itself seemed to be born
only to destroy, what will not
be born of that which seems to

be born only to produce, beget, L
and multiply? If it was able to i

IS THEREIA REAL GOD?

BY IVIARSHALL J. GAUVIN

Lecturer, Pittsburgh Rationa-list
Society

This lecture is a masterly survey
of the belief in God. Beginning with
the deiﬁeation of the powers of na-
ture by savage man, it traces the
development of the god idea. through
the worship of animals, to its high-
est reﬁnement in the human form.
The doctrine that the evil of the
world is caused hy a devil, or that
God is limited and is doing the best
he can, is argued out of court. The
gradual evolution of all things under
the reign of natural law is dwelt
upon, and the disappearance of the
belief in God as intelligence in-
creases is pointed out. Rich in fact
and thought and argument, the whole
lecture is an illuminating and con-
vincing exposition of religl0n‘s funda-
mental fallacy.

do so much wrth the lava and-
. red-hot cinders, which were the

only elements that it possessed,
what will it not be able to do
with all that it will end by
possessing?

It is well, sometimes, to tell
ourselves, especially’ in these
days of distress and discourage-
ment, that we are living in a
world which has not yet ex-
hausted its future and which
is much nearer to its beginning
than to its end. It was born
but yesterday, and has only just
disentangled its original chaos.
It, is at the starting-point of its
hopes and of its experience. We
believe that it is making for
death, whereas all its past, on
the contrary, shows that it is
much more probably making
for life. In any case, as its
years pass by, the quantity, and
still more the quality, of the
life which it engenders and

maintains tend to increase and.

to improve. It has given us
only the ﬁrst—fruits of its mir-

I acles; and in all likelihood there

is no more connection between
what it was and what it is than

there will be between what it is
and what it will be.’ No doubt,

"when its greatest marvels burst
/into being, we shall no longer

possess the lives which we
possess today, but we shall still
be there under another form;
we shall still be existing some-
where, on its surface or in its
depths, and it is not utterly im-
probable that one of its last
prodigies will reach us in our
dust, awaken us, and recall us
to life, in order to impart to
usithe share of happiness which
we had not enjoyed and to teach
us that we were wrong not to
interest ourselves, on the fur-
ther side of our graves, in the
destiny of this earth of ours,
whereof we had never ceased
to begthe immortal offspring.

A HAUNTED HOUSE

From the pages of the “Jour-
nal Kept During a Visit to B——
House,’ by the Marquis of
Bute, K. C., and other distin-
guished scientists,’..from the
news columns of the London
Times and from the ofﬁcial rec-
ords of the British Society for
Psychical Research, the follow-
ing reports of an investigation
of an alleged "haunted manor
house" at Falkland, Fifeshire,
Scotland, are compiled.

These records were written,
edited and prepared for publi-
cation by Sir Oliver Lodge, the
Marquis of Bute, Col. Le M.
Taylor, Sir William Huggins,
F. W. H. Myers, Miss Freer,
Miss Langdon, Miss Moore and
other members ofthe Society

for Psychical Research, whose,

statements of what they actu-
ally saw and heard in the Falk-
land manor are declared to be
Miss Freer is
the author of “Essays on Psy-
chical Research,” and Col. Tay-

lor “has a standing as a ‘4‘sp_e-I

cialist” on haunte-d houses.
The facts of the case, brieﬂy

‘outlined, are that B——- House

in some manner earned the rep-
utation of being haunted. Ru-

THE ME-LTILN-(I3 POT

I-mors reached the outside world

of spectral ﬁgures seen at win-
(lows and even in the grounds
surrounding the manor, of un-
earthly noises, clanging chains,
groans and shrieks without

which no ghost story is con-,

sidered complete.

It may seem superfluous to
add that B-——— House is unoc-
cupied.

A committee from the Society
for Psychical Research,’ includ-
ing among its members those
whose names are given above,
was sent to B ,House pre-
pared to‘ stay there, to eat and
sleep there for weeks, if neces-
sary, to investigate thoroughly
and to report to the society
just ‘exactly what they had seen,
heard and encountered, an-d,
further, to offer all possible
explanations they could of the
ghostly phenomena they fully
expected to confront them. The
committee invaded the Falk-
land manor house with phono-
graphs and blank phonograph
discs on which ghostly noises

were to be recorded, with cam-

eras and ﬂashlights for the pur-
pose of taking snapshots of the
ghosts, if such were possible,
and with silk threads to be
stretched across staircases, pas-
sageways and terraces, the re-
puted favorite stalking places
of the Falkland “spooks.”

L So much for the actual facts
of the case. For further details

of what happened reference is

made to the ofﬁcial reports of

the investigating committee.
It was on Feb. 3, according

to the report made by Miss

Freer, that the guests arrived.’

After taking measurements of
the houseand thoroughly ex-
ploring it from top to bottom,
they proceeded to set about ob-
serving any phenomena which.
might be manifested. None
occurred that evening,‘ how-
ever, and it was not until 3
o’clock the next morning,,when
all in the house. were‘ fast
asleep, that the ﬁrst strange
phenomenon took place. They
were. then all suddenly awak-

\

ened by “a tremendous clanging I
sound,which resounded through I
the house. The mental image
it brought to my mind‘ was as
of a long metal bar, such as I I
have seen near iron foundries,
being struck at intervals with
a wooden mallet. * * * It
seemed to come diagonally
‘across the house.” A

A few days later the follow-
ing very remarkable observance
is noted by Miss Freer and the
Marquis of Bute, in their “Jour-
nal Kept During a Visit to B-—.
House”:

“About 10 a. m. I was writing
‘in the library, face to light,
back to ﬁre. Mrs. W——— was
in the room and addressed me
once or twice; but I was aware
of not being responsive, as I
was much occupied. I wrote
on, and presently felt a dis-
tinct, but gentle push against
my chair. I thought it was the
dog,» and looked down, but he
was not there. I went on writ-
ing, and in a few minutes felt
a push, ﬁrm and decided,
against my shoulder, which
moved me on my chair. I
thought it was Mrs W ',
who, having spoken and ob-
tained no answer, was remind-I
ing me of her presence. I
looked backward with an ex-
cla1nation—-—the room was emp-
ty. She came in directly and
called my attention to the dog,
which was gazing intently from
the hearthrug at the place
where I had previously ‘ex-
pected to see it. * * *‘

“As the day began with the

it above, and I had had a quiet

rest, I went to" the copse at
dusk. The moon was bright

‘V and the twilight lingered. We

waited about in the avenue to
let it get dusker, but it was
still farfrom dark when we
made our way up to the glen—
Miss Moore, Miss Langton and
myself (Miss Freer).

“I saw the two ghosts, ‘Ish-
bel’ and ‘Marget,’ in an old
spot across the brook. ‘Ish-

~ bel’, was on her knees, in an

attitude of weeping, ‘Marget’
apparently reasoning with her
in a low voice, to which ‘Ishbel’
replied very occasionally. I
could not hear what was said

-for the noise of the brook. We

waited for perhaps 10 or 15 min-
utes. They had appeared when
I.had been there perhaps three

“or four minutes and remained

visible all the rest of the time.

. “The dog ran up to ‘where we
were then and ran straight for
the two ﬁgures. He afterwards
left us, and we found him bark-
ing in the glen. He is_a dog
who hardly ever barks. We
went up among the trees where
he was and could ﬁnd no
cause. (Journal, pp.
ll6-17.)

Two days later this entry was
made in the investigating com-
mittee’sidiary by Miss Freer:

H
n

“This morning’s phenomenon
is the most incomprehensible I
have yet known. I heard the
clanging sounds after we were
in bed last night. Early‘ this
morning, about _ 5:30, I was
awakened by them.. They con-
tinued for nearly an hour. Then
another sound began in my
room, which Miss Moore
shared with me. It might have
been made by a very lively kit-
tein jumping and pouncing, or
even: by a very large bird; there
was a ﬂuttering noise, too. It
was close, exactly opposite the
bed. Miss Moore woke up, and
we heard it going on till nearly

8 o’clock. I drew up the blinds

and ‘opened the window wide.

looking into cupboards and, un-
der furniture. We cannot guess
at any possible explanation.
* * *” (pp. ll9-20).

The next day the ghost ‘Ish-
bel’ is reported to have been
seen walking in ‘the glen, by
two different people at the
same time; one saw the ﬁgure,
full-face, and the other, proﬁle.
Both drew their impressions of
the ﬁgure afterwards, and they
corresponded. The curious
thing was that in the full-face
ﬁgure, no face was visible in
the phantom—only a blank
space where the face should
have been. The person who
saw the full-face ﬁgure had the
distinct impression that she was
being .“looke-d at.” (Journal,
p. 123.)

A number of experiments

were tried by the investigators
about this time. Crystal gazing
and automatic writing were at-
tempted, and seances—hypnotic
and mediurnistic--were conduct-
ed in the drawing room. These
were, on the whole, disappoint-
ing, except that the name ‘Ish-

el’ appeared during the writ-
ing test. All the household
declared that they heard loud
raps, voices, whisperings, and
footsteps pacing up and down
the hall; but the curious thing
was that—though all in the
house believed they heard these
steps and were awakened by
theni——a phonograph failed to
record the slightest sound.
‘Nothing was marked upon the
phonograph disc, nor would
the photographic plate record

the phantasmal ﬁgures which,
» many of those in the house de-

clared they positively saw,
walking about the rooms and
up and down the stairs.

A number of interesting and i

suggestive experiments were
tried in this-connection, how-
ever, to test the solidity or ma-
teriality of the phantom ﬁgures.

- The investigators say they had

become so accustomedto the
presence of their ghostly vis-
itors that they soon ceased to

 

 

regard them with any concern‘

“when they passed them on the
stairs, or felt their touch upon
their shoulders.”

Bgt, on a couple of evenings,
they placed a number of ﬁne
silk threads across the stairs,
at different heights——tying one
end to the banister railing and
attaching the other end to the
wall by a piece of wax. These
threads were invisible in the
dusk light, but a slight touch

V would sufﬁce to knock them

down, by detaching the wax
from the wall.

“Although,” the report con-
tinues, “the phantom forms
were repeatedly seen to walk
along the halls and up and down
the stairs, walking apparently
through these threads,.none of

4 them were found loose or de-

tached in the morning. The
ghost had evidently walked
through them without knowing
it, therefore, and was not solid
enough to break the thread or

sever its connection with the

wall.”

Up to this time the happen-
ings in the house had been
fairly pleasant in character-
or, at any rate, not disquieting
—but about this time things
began to take on a different
turn, and we read on’ page 210
of the diary: “The genera-1 tone
of things is -disquieting and new
in our experience. Hitherto, in
our ﬁrst occupation, the phe-
nomena affected one as mel-
ancholy, depressing and per-
plexing, but now all, quite in-
dependently, say the same thing
——that the inﬂuence is evil and
horrible — even po or little
‘Spooks,’ the dog, was never
terriﬁed before. The worn faces
at breakfast are really a dismal
sight.”

It was atuthis time that “one
of the most terrifying-—-even
blood-curdling experiences”——is
_related to have happened to one
of the party-—a Mr. H ;
yet he records it as an actually

true experience. Mr. H ,‘

according to a report, prepared
by him and now published on
pages 279-80 of “Real Ghost
Stories,” was in the garden, at

THE MELTING POT

the back of the house, and look-
ing up at one of the windows
in the upper story, he saw a
sight which he describes Lgtthe
following words:

“Presently, to our horror, a
ﬁgure appeared resembling
Miss B , yet most unlike
her; its fearful eyes were gaz-
ing at me without movement
an-d totally expressionless. VVhat
then, caused the arresting of the
heart’s pulsation (as it felt) and
the blood, that the moment be—
fore had burnt as it coursed
madly through the veins, to be
chilled to ice? This——one was
face to face with a spirit, and
withered by the contact! Those
eyes—I. can see them, I can feel
them, after all this time, as
though they were still gazing
at me! I continued gazing,

 

spellbound, like‘ the ‘Wed-ding

Guest,’ I was held by the spirit’s
eye, and I could not choose but
look! The dreadful hands were
lifted automatically; they rested
on the window-sash._ It came
partly down, stayed a moment,
then noiselessly closed, and I
saw a hand raise and hasp it. I
gazed steadfastly throughout.
What impressed me strangely
was this peculiarity, that as
soon as the sash had passed the
face the latter vanished; the
hands remained; the unreality.
of the actual movement of the
window as it descended also
seemed to contradict me; it
suggested the (for want of a
better comparison) mechanical
‘passage of stage scenery, or
"some sort of toys that are
pulled by wires; it made no
noise whatever.

“Now I distinctly recognized
the shaps as that of Rhoda, Miss
B ’s elder sister, who had
been dead some I2 years. I
had never seen her during life,
but I at once knew her by the
resemblance to a‘ portrait in the
drawing room, even to the red
bow which she always wore.

‘The following afternoon I went

to B ’s house’ and we went

up into the room. I threw the

window up. Then we went into
the garden and sat in the sum-

 

mer house. Presently we look-
ed out and saw two hands at
the window. They drew it a

“ little down, then vanished to the
right, as if annoyed at our see-
ing them. After some time we
looked again and saw the backs
of two hands on the outside of
the window, but they did not
move it. ”' * *

“Presently there came forward
a headless ﬁgure and distinctly
bowed two or three times, then
immediately afterwards a deaf-
ening slam at the door. The
apex of this ﬁgure, which was
rotund -— that is, neckless -
once or twice dilated, and we
feared seeing something, we
we knew, not what; it then van-
ished and we saw a beautiful
arm come to the curtain and
wave to us. Upstairs, again,
the door was shut; on entering
we saw the chair overturned in
the middle of the room and the
fruit which we had placed upon
it scattered in all directions,
and to our horror the note ad-
dressed to ‘the spirit,’ which I
had folded and placed on the
chair, charred at one corner. _I
took it up, but lacked the
courage to open and, perhaps,
ﬁnd a possible reply. Placing‘
it on a plate, I burnt it. The
process was a very slow one
and it distilled a dark mu-
mus. * * * ”

It is interesting to note that
the alleged phenomena in this
remarkable house gradually be-
came less and less frequent and
startling until, by. the time the
investigators had left, the
“ghosts” were hardly noticeable
—at all. The Falkland manor
house has lost its reputation of
being haunted. It is now oc-
cupied and ‘the tenants have
failed to find anything unusual
in the house.

“Leslie,” said a school
teacher, “can you tell me hovs;
iron was discovered?”

“Yes, ma’m!’

“Well, tell the class what you
know.”

“I heard father say that they
smelt it.” ’

ABOIIT RATS

The direct ‘loss in food and
material due to rats amounts to
$200,000,000 annually in the

United States, says the National ,

Geographic Magazine. The in-
direct losses, including the “ef-
fect upon public health and
commerce from the diseases
carried by rats and the sums
spent in combating them, add
materially to this ﬁgure.

We have lived with the rats
so long that we take them as
a matter of course. But a look
into their nocturnal activities
will show us that it is high time
a war against them is started
throughout the country. Rats
produce from six to twelve lit-
ters a year, with an average of
ten young rats per litter. On
a New England farm last year

a farmer killed 9,000 rats, proof it

of their ability to multiply ‘as
well as of his enterprise.

Rats are persistent enemies of
growing crops and seeded ﬁelds.
They are highly destructive of
young chickens, turkeys and
eggs. They hold high carnival
in grain elevators, storehouses
and storerooms. What they
can not eat they destroy. Rats
are carriers of plague germs
and scatter death over a wide
circle. The total amount of the
damage they do would ransom
a nation from starvation.

The United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture has printed
a series of pamphlets on rat
extermination. The Govern-
ment urges all citizens to send
for these books. They cost
nothing. With such reservoirs
of advice and information avail-
able, and with the need of con-
servation of resources so urgent,
the public should inaugurate
its own war of frightfulness
against a common enemy aiid
one lurking at our very doors.

believed that a pro—war statement will

be necessary to reunite the party.

In the face of the bald demonstration of
autocracy’s purpose to crush democracy
wherever it may manifest itself, no Amer-
ican Socialist, as deeply as he may deplore
war, can ﬁnd but two courses to pursue-
one to support the prosecution of the war
until autocracy receives its death blow, and
the other to support the Kaiser until democ-
racy becomes a corpse. THE MELTING Pot

  The Journey

N this world of incongruities, millions
have starved to death, while others at
their very door have, in the language

of the old proverb, “dug their graves with
their teeth.” T

To the superﬂuity ofthe latter is largely
due the sufferings of the former.

In the days when “knighthood was in
ﬂower”-—when caparisoned killers rode
roughshod over the ragged tillers of the
soil——the chief end of life of the more for-
tunate classes was to gorge themselves.
They were bred in ignorance and died in
They could neither read nor
write, but could gormandize and guzzle to
put to shame the pigs. The inherited in-
stincts of a time when meals were irregular
and far between, when, in the struggle for
raw food, a man had to eat when he had the
chance, and in sufficient quantity to keep
him alive until the next meal, still guided
the appetite‘.

Nor have these inherited instincts as yet
completely passed away. They still ﬁll
men’s minds with the fear of hunger. They
are the furies that harden men’s hearts in the
pursuit of gold. For, be it known, gold is
the modern weapon that brings to its pos-
sessor the coveted feast. Every dollar is
a feathered shaft that provides the prey;
and, as the savage realized that his existence
depended upon the arrows in his quiver and
that starvation stared him in the face were
he to lose them and be unable to obtain
more, so does the modern man look upon
the dollars in his possession. Nay, more,
his fear is greater than was that of the sav-
age, to whom the shaft of the forest and
the ﬂint of the quarry were accessible. Not
so with the source of the dollars. That
source easily becomes limited, and even en-

tirely closed; and poverty, staring the mod-
ern man in the face, contains more terrors
than the luckless hunt that at times over-
took the savage. It is for these reasons that
the savage is naturally honest and truthful,
while the civilized man becomes tricky and
deceitful. Our characters are formed by
economic determinism.

When one contemplates the struggle for
existence that has followed the daring mem-
bers of the race that migrated from the trop-
ics the wonder arises thatwe have advanced
as far and have become as cultured as we
are. And then upon this comes the thought
of what human society might be, and will
be, when the ﬁerce ﬁght to feed our bodies
disappears—when the wolf and the wild-
cat in us gives way to the developed human.
Then the hoarders of gold, the duplicates

of the old-time gormandizers, will become‘

extinct; and the hungry ones, the left—overs

of the old-time slave system, will be no more. ’

Only a common humanity, unfolding itself
in a commonwealth where the fear of want
no longer divides the race into hostile
camps. Then, and then only, will be under-
stood the words of the proletarian prophet
of Palestine, “Take no thought (worry) for
your life, what ye Shall eat, or what ye shall
drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall
put on. Is not the life more than meat, and
the body than raiment ?”

As yet, to the many, the life and the body

mean little more than an uncertain strug-'

gle for meat and raiment; while to the few
the life and thebody still mean_little more
than the seizing and holding of all the meat
and raiment they can lay their hands on.
Out of this heart-hardening state we must
come, even as our ancestors emerged from
cannibalism.. It is our destiny—it is‘the les-
son of the hour, that we are surely learning.

The law of economic determinism, that
discloses the historic fact that what we are
——our ethics, our morals, our religions, even
our health and happiness-—are modeled after
the manner in which we obtain our bread
and butter, will build the race into ever
growing wisdom and gentleness when the
ﬁght for food is over, and the fear of want
is driven from the world of men and women.
Then the machine,'with its giant electric
muscles and its tireless arms of steel, will
be the servant of all; and the souls of men
and women, free from the instincts of con-
queror and conquered, will triumph over

the beast; the sensual will atrophy, and the-

spiritual live; the weeds of superstition and
falsehood will give way to the ﬂowers of
knowledge and truth. I conﬁdently predict
that the preachers, of whom the more ad-

vanced students are even now ashamed of
the fables that their salaries depend upon
sustaining, will gladly revolutionize their
religion, and re-write their Bible, to con-
form to an age of industrial and intellectual
‘democracy. The righteous and beautiful
will be preserved; while the absurd and sav-
age will be set aside.

Few there be with souls so dead that they
do not hear the call summoning them to the
new age——the Age of Humanity. The
heights are just above us, where triumphant
Man shall stand. Below is the long trail,
all duly traveled. The way is traced in the
race-memory, all down to the Saurian
swamps. The Night fades——the Dawn ap-
pears——the Day towards which we have
been journeying for countless centuries
draws near. - '

The Form of Family Life

HE form of family life, like the styles
of women’s headgear, has undergone
various changes_in human society. At

one time—and they were at least healthy
then, even tho crude and uncultured——every-
body was married. Primitive people boasted
no bachelor maids or men. There were no
unnatural vices, no venereal diseases, no
prostitution. Neither were there any nerv-
ous prostrations or feeble—minded. The
nerves of the primitive people were like
iron, and their mentalities, tho limited, alert.
True,,they were doubtless early subject to
superstition, but then they were not much
worse off, in this respect, than their more
enlightened descendants.

There was no marriage ceremony among
the ﬁrst humans. Neither were there any di-
vorce proceedings. There wasn’t a child in
those days wise enough to know its own
father. The line of descent was from the
mother. It was the only possible way to
keep trace of the youngsters. It is possible
that in some casesthe mother may have had
a reasonably fair suspicion as to who was

the father of her last child, but these were

too rare to count.

The first form of family life was the Con-
sanguine. “It was,” to quote America’s
great ethnologist, Lewis H. Morgan (An-
cient Society), “founded upon intermarriage
of brothers and sisters, own and collateral,
in a.group.” i '

Doubtless the discovery that such intense .

inbreeding had the tendency to weaken the

race, ﬁnally brought about the second form
of family life, the Punaluan.

“It was founded upon the intermarriage
of several sisters, own and collateral, with
each other’s husbands, in a group; the joint
husbands not being necessarily kinsmen of
each other, Also, on the intermarriage of
several brothers, own and collateral, with
each other’s wives, in a group; these
wives not being necessarily of kin to
each other, altho often the case in both in-—
stances. In each case the group of men
were conjointly married to the group of
women.” '

The third form of family life was the Syn-
dyasmian, or Pairing Family.

“It was founded upon marriage between
single pairs, but without an exclusive cohab-
itation. The marriage continued during the
pleasure of the parties.” ‘

The fourth form of family life was the
Patriarchal Family.

“It was founded upon the marriage of one
man with-several wives; followed, in gen-
eral, by the seclusion of the wives” (the
home being a harem).

The ﬁfth form of family life is the Mono-
gamian Family, “founded upon marriage be-
tween single pairs, with an exclusive (that
is, supposedly) cohabitation.”

It‘ is impossible here to reproduce the ex-
haustive research and study, occupying
years, made by Morgan, that testiﬁes to the
correctness of the foregoing historic record
of the different forms of family life. For

this the reader is referred to his work, “An-
cient Society.” It is sufﬁcient here to state

‘that not only ancient writings, but also the

living witnesses of these forms were found.
As an example, “intermarriage between
brothers and sisters had‘ not entirely dis-
appeared from the Sandwich Islands when
the American missions * * * were estab-
lished among them.”

The traces of the various forms of family
life that Morgan found among the American
Indians and other tribes rank among the
greatest contributions known to ethnology.
The accumulated testimony of the common
experience of the entire race in the sucessive
forms of family life is overwhelming. It is
summed up in the following quotation:

“The theory of human degradation to ex-
plain the existence of savages and barba-
rians is no longer tenable. It came in as a
corollary from the Mosaic cosmogony, and
was acquiesced in from a supposed necessity
which no longer exists. As a theory, it is
not only incapable of explaining the exist-
ence of savages, but it is without support in
the facts of human experience. The remote
ancestors of the Aryan nations presump-
tively passed through an experience similar
to that of existing barbarous and savage
tribes. Tho the experience of these na-
tions embodies all the information necessary
to illustrate the periods of civilization,‘ both
ancient and modern, together with a part of
that in the later period of barbarism, their
anterior experience must be deduced, in the
main, from the traceable connection between
the elements of their existing institutions
and inventions, and similar elements still
preserved in those of savage and barbarous
tribes. It may be remarked ﬁnally that the
experience of mankind has run in nearly
uniform channels; that human necessities
in similar conditions have been substantially
the same; and that the operations of the
mental principle have been uniform in vir-
tue of the speciﬁc identity of the brain of all
the races of mankind. This, however, is but
a part of the explanation of uniformity in
results. The germs of the principal institu-
tions and arts of life were developed while
man was still a savage. To a very great
exten_t the experience of the subsequent
periods of barbarism and of civilization have
been expended in the further development
of these original conceptions. VVherever a
connection can be traced on different conti-
nents between a present institution and a
common germ, the derivation of the people
themselves from a common original'stock
is implied.”

The’ ﬁndings of the modern ethnologist
distinctly mark the traveled path of the
race. We are divided into’seven periods of
existence; The Older Savagery, the Middle
Savagery, the Later Savagery, the Older
Barbarism, the Middle Barbarism, the Later
Barbarism, and Civilization.

It is the prediction of analytical minds
that the eighth period will be Socialism.

Of the seven periods that the race has
experienced, the conditions are deﬁned as
follows: I. From the infancy of the human
race to the commencement of the next
period. (During this infancy period the
form of family life was undoubtedly like
that of animals, a community of the sexes.)
II. From the acquisition of a ﬁsh subsistence
and a-knowledge of the use of ﬁre to the
commencement of the next period. III.
From the invention of the bow and arrow
to the commencement of the next period.
IV. From the invention of the art of pottery
to the commencement of the next period.
V. From the domestication of animals on
the Eastern hemisphere, and from the culti-
vation of corn and plants on the Western
hemisphere, with the use of the adobe—brick
and stone for building purposes, to the com-
mencement of the next period. VI. From
the invention of the process of smelting iron
ore, with the use of iron tools, to the com-
mencement of the next period. VII. From
the invention of a phonetic alphabet, with
the use of writing, to the present time.-

The change of the order of descent from
the female to the male line unquestionably
took place with the institution of the system
of private property, which became the pos-
session of the males. Laws regarding in-
heritance followed the natural desire of
the male owner of the property to.be-
queath it to his own offspring. I think it
is safe to assume that paternal affection
started to take root when the old man began
to wonder who would own and enjoy his
possessions after he was, gone. It was then
he began to care for the boy he had begat.
It was then that laws were made inflicting
death'upon the woman caught in adultery.
lehovah himself never thought of any such
law to apply to the male. The inference is
plai-n———the man wanted to be sure that it
was his own blood thatwould inherit his
ﬂocks. A

From that time, and extending to the
present day, woman, to a greater or lesser
extent, has been regarded as part of the
private property of the man. The system
of private ownership of the means of life,
with little or no regard to the,morals .in-
volved in the manner by which it is ob-

tained, has made slaves of the proletarian
males, and worse than slaves of the females.
They were sold naked on the auction block
in times gone by; and are virtually still
sold, not only in brothels, but in high so-
ciety of today. For after all for a woman to
marry for money is but a thinly veneered
substitute for becoming the property of the
highest male bidder at the auction block.
The race that has carried over the arts at-
tained in all its previous periods, has also
retained, to a more or less degree, its im-
moralities. ‘

The future form of family life, which is
the foundation upon which must be built
the coming Age of Humanity, must be free
from the pollutions of the past. There must
be ademocracy of the sexes, as well as of
politics and industries. A woman depend-
ent upon a male meal ticket is but little
removed from her bondage of the patri-

archal days. Only a family life resting upon

mutual choice and affection, together with -

the economic freedom of both the man and
the woman, can create the higher order of
humanity.

The seventh period of man (the present)
is in the travail of a new birth. In this
period slavery is scotched but not slain.
The instincts of the primeval brute still
influence our lives. The form of fam-
ily life, which creates the social life,
is still stained with the strain of by-
gone systems. The consanguinity of the
clan still calls to us. In the New Age
blooms and blossoms the Internationalism,
that formed the seed from which our parent
stock sprang, and the form of the family life,
cultured and cleansed from the animal, and
free from all bondage, will bear a race
strong inibody and sweet in soul.

Raising Bacon in a Bathroom

PRESS dispatch from Oklahoma City,
Ok., says:
“The old song, They Kept the
Pig in the Parlor, is now supplanted
with They Kept the Pig in the Bath-
room. Mark Kessler, Commissioner of
Public Safety, said a family had been
. discovered which had kept a good-sized
pig and reared it from a ‘shoat in the
' bathroom of their ﬁat here.”

As a» food—supplying source for city ﬂat-
dwellers who have no backyard space to
raise chickens, the bathroom bacon industry
may look .somewhat inviting, As far as the
pig is concerned there is no reason to doubt
but that with proper care it will thrive just
as well in a city bathroom as in a country
barnyard.‘ A pig isn’t a bit particular. It
would just as lief eat out of a porcelain tub
as from a wooden trough. Besides, the tub,
especially with a shower—bath attachment,
would make the ﬁnest kind of a place to wal-

low- in. Then again the proposition would
go a long way towards solving the garbage
problem. In fact, with a healthy, growing

V pig on the job, there wouldn’t be much of

anything left but empty tin cans and waste
paper. If the pig could be induced to take
a nanny goat for a roommate the problem
would be virtually settled. The goat would
eat the paper and tin, and the housewife

' could milk her and thus more than get their
.value back. This, added to the prospective

bacon, would be no small item in lowering
the high cost of living.

Of course, there are some things to take
into consideration regarding raising a pig
in a bathroom,—even with the goat left out——
whose additional company would tend to
make matters worse. Pigs can hardly be

handled like babies. Nor can they be ‘sup-i 
posed to know anything about modern con-.

veniences. Besides, to those not experienced
in the bathroom bacon industry, the ques-
tion arises as to how the pig behaves when
a member of the family is taking a bath.
Does it ,sit quietly over in one corner, or
does it want to climb into the tub? Or does
somebody hold the pig while the ablutions
are going on? Or can the pig be trained to
take the place of a scrubbing brush? Or
does the family abstain from bathing while

the bacon is being raised?
These matters ought to be investigated
-before any city ﬂat—dwel1er, who may read

these lines, undertakes raising bacon in a
bathroom.

Idols of Earth and Sky

R. VROBERT T. MORRIS, of New
York, is the author of a new book,
entitled “The Way Out of War,” in
which he says: “By studying the scientiﬁc
march of events, tracing the long war of
ameba and microbe, examining the effect of
the chemical action of emotion upon man’s
brain, the natural scientist can not only an-
alyze the nature of war, but predict and as-
sist thc coming of peace.” He turns to bi-
ology to ‘ﬁnd the cause of war. “The Ger-
mans,” he says, “in laying stress on Dar-
Win’s doctrine of the struggle for existence
have completely forgotten his other doctrine
of mutual interdependence. Instead of culti-
vating the good will of other nations, the
Prussians are now trying to smash them.
Prussia is protoplasmically senile. She is
done for. In fact, any nation that deliber-
ately wages war is abnormal, for war is
always a symptom of deﬁcient brain devel-
opment.” _

That the deliberately waging of war,
which is the age—old stock-in-trade of divine-
ly ordained autocrats, is “a symptom of de-
ﬁcient brain development,” goes without
saying. 'Only a madman could do it—and

the history of royal-ruled society has been ,

plentifully supplied with madmen.
But d.oes a false conception of biology ex-
plain their presence? Has not a false re-

ligion played the big part in producing and.
V perpetuating them? The religious wars
I alone, leaving out all others, seem sufﬁcient

to testify to this. And is not the Old Testa-
ment God of Christendom——the side-partner
of the Kaiser——a war-lord? ‘Turn to your
Bible and read: “Thus saith the Lord God

of Israel, Put every man his sword by his
side, and go in and out from gateto gate

thruout the camp, and slay every man his’

brother, and every man his companion, and
every man his neighbor” (Exodus, xxxii,
27).

_That is bad enough, but here is some-
thing worse: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts
(‘host,‘ says Webster’s dictionary, is ‘a great
number of men ready for war’), I remember
that which Amalek did to Israel, how he
laid wait for him in the way, when he came
up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek,
and utterly destroy all that they have, and
spare them not; but slay both man and
woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep,
camel and ass” (First Samuel, xv, 2-3),
And King Saul, to whom this commandment
of Jehovah was given, via the mouth of the
fortune-teller Samuel, made a wholesale
killing of the Amalekites. Anyway, that is
what the chapter referred to declares. But
further on in the same book (First Samuel,
chapter xxvii, beginning at verse 8), it ap-
pears that some of the Amalekites escaped
the slaughter, and allied themselves with the
Geshurites and Gezrites. But David. who
afterwards became King of Israel, discov-
ered them, and slew both them and their
allies, m_ale and female, old and young.
However, David did not kill the cattle; he
herded them into his own private pastures.

Such savage stories as this have doubtless
made a deep impression on the Kaiser.

T-he story of the slaughter of the Amalek-
ites is quite instructive in showing up the
character of Jehovah. As previously quoted
from chapter xv, of First Samuel,. the Lord

 

 

  

of hosts\said—or is said to have said——“I re-

member that which Amalek did to Israel._”
Turn back to Exodus, chapter xvii, begin-
ning at verse 8, and read how Moses fought
Amalek, holding a rod in his hand that Je-
hovah had charmed, and how Moses’ forces

‘ prevailed just as long as he was able to hold

this rod high up in the air, and how
Amalek’s prevailed whenever Moses’ arms
gave out. Finally, with the help of two
able-bodied assistants, who took hold of and
sustained the wizard’s weary wings, Moses
und Gott managed to win the day; but the
stubbornness of the ancient Amalekites
(similar to that of the modern,Belgians) so
angered Jehovah that he vowe‘d a vow, and
said, “I will utterly put ‘out the remem-

brance of Amalek from under heaven”— '

which, being interpreted, means that he pro-
posed to wipe them off the earth. And a
little over 400 years afterwards, according to
Bible chronology, in the days of King Saul,
who had built up a strong military power,
Jehovah remembered his vow and proceeded
to make it good. .

The original easus belli that started the
war between Amalek and Israel was be-
cause the Amalekites objected to the Jews
locating on their ﬁelds and devouring their
fruits and ﬂocks. Also, as the Amalekites
were foreigners, capturing their stout young
men for bonded farm hands, and their best
looking young women for waiting maids to
the. chosen chiefs of God. Candidly con-
sider the character of Jehovah as revealed
in the Amalekite raid, and that of the Kaiser
as revealed in later-day raids. To the un-
biased it’s quite an interesting comparison.

Of course it will be said that Jesus re-
pudiated all this. But what of that, so long

, as Jesus himself is repudiated? It isn’t Je-

sus, nor his teachings, that orthodox Chris-
tianity follows. l.t’s the jungle God Jeho-
vah. Jesus has been a back number ever
since the time that Constantine’s priests put
the ﬁxin’s to him. They even made Jehovah
his father. Paul is all right, but Jesus, and
his early Jewish followers, do not ﬁt at all
into orthodox religion.

And who is this Jehovah of the ancient
Jews—-this war-lord and ordainer of kings,
to whom David, and also Wilhelm II.,

prays: “Blessed be the Lord, my strength,

which teacheth my hands to war, and my
ﬁngers‘, to ﬁght”'(Psalms, cliv, 1)?

‘He was a tribal god that belonged to the
Midianites and Kenites. In Exodus iii,

that Jehovah had, years previous, appeared
incognito to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob. Moses, according to the Old
Testament account, was closely connected
with these tribes. The second chapter of
Exodus tells of his escape from Pharaoh’s
vengeance, for having killed an Egyptian
task—master, and «locating in the land of
Midian. Here he married a daughter of
Jethro, the Midianite priest; and it was
while tending his father—in-law’s ﬂocks, near
Horeb, the mountain of God of the Midian-
ites, that the Midianite God Yaweh—after-
wards known as Jehovah—called to Moses,
so we are told (Exodus, iii, 4), out of 3,.
burning bush. As this was the ﬁrst live god
that Moses had ever met——altho he must
have heard of numerous others that were
worshiped in Egypt—he appropriated him
for himself and his brother Israelites.

Says the Encyclopedia Britannica (article
on Jehovah): “‘It is probable that Yaweh
‘was at one time worshiped by various tribes
south of Palestine, and that several places
(Horeb, Sinai,
Kadesh, etc.) were sacred to him; the oldest
and most famous of these, the mountain of
God, seems to have lain in Arabia, east of
