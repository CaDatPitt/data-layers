During me last wildcat of May
2,3,4, man igement set up a camera
to take pictures of those on the
picket "ﬁes. After extensive in-
‘. /s..,,..'tion DRUM has discovered
that all of the people on the picket
lines were not disciplined. Two
white skilled tradesmen Wild (Bill)
Nemeyer and Jim Menzilla were
on film but the leading white bigot
Joe Kozma saw fit to use the pow
er of skilled trades and the racist
policy of management to kept these
two white workers in the plant.
And yet a black worker on after-
noon shift who did not go out to
lunch on the night of the strike and
another black worker who works
days and was at home in bed t
the time of the wildcat were bot
given 3!) days off as instigators.
Drum feels that this can easily be
explained if the camera man wasa
racist and using a racist camera
then we can understand why these
two black brothers were given time
off and the two white workers were
spared. But on the other hand if
this can not be explained the only
explanation has to be that racism

is common everyday practice in
Hamt -zmck Assembly and Local3.

looting

In the recent plant committeeman
election held in the transportation
and Winfield Foundry.

Lee Cain outlined a program
that if he got elected plant com-

. mitteeman, he would fight to change

" the classification cf the material

handlers who unload boat cars and
truck trailers to a heavy duty
material classification. Also to
figlt to ap ‘»ly the 1048 heavy
duty classification to those truck

drivers who now unload box cars

and supply the line with motors,

doors, tops, transmissions, and

axles.

Because of Lee Cain's fight re-
'cord in the Local on the question
of civil rights, foremen and com-
pany agents were running around
telling the workers that Lee Cain
was one of those black power
boys and  he was electai plant
committeeman, it would streng-
then the black power movement
to take over the local and would

encourage more looting.

What about the looting? The

real question is what about the
looting by the big corporations.
The looting cf exploitation, the
looting of racist practices. What
about the company looting the ma-
terial handlers that unload box
cars out of ten cents an hour?
What about the company looting
the truck drivers that unload box
cars and supply the ldie with
motors, tops, doors, transmiss-
ions and axeles out of 11 cents
an hour? That goes on every

day d the year. When a man is
absent, and he is not replaced,
what about that looting? On the
question of speed -up, the worker's
life, health and self-respect is
being looted away from him by the
company. This kind of looting goes
onevery day of the year.

eoeel   Discrimination»

There are 930 0_w_9_rkers at

local 3 66% of these 930v workers

are black. ' Every month all of
9,300 uruon members pay on 2.

average of $6.82 in union dues.
Black workers alone 5,')OOo_f them

pay at a mimnum approximately
$l,2=.?--J daily, $.fI,MO weekly, $38,

010 monthly and $436,U-'JJ annually
in union dues. All of that money
in union dues comes from the works
and sweat of black workers and
guess where it goes. U.A.W.
Local 3 keeps all of its .ac cunts
in the Peoples State Bank located
on Holbrook and Jos. Campu. in
Hamtranck. The People State
Bank just like Chryster Corpor-
ation's Hamtramck Assembly plant
has a long history of discrimins-
,tory iiiiiug policy. The People
State Bank does not have any
black people in it’s employ. We

have stated that black workers
contribute approximately $456,000
annually into the U.A.W. Local 3
account and in turn black people
cannot even get jobs at the bank
inwhich this account is kept.

This is a ridiculous outrage this
is a direct insult, this is infamy
this is another in a long list 01’
slaps in the face’s of black wor-
kers by the U.A.W. and it's local
charlatans. Drum demands that

the U.A.W. Local 3 demand imm-
ediately that the Peoples State
Bank does away with it's discrim

inatory hiring policy or that the
U.A.W. local 3 account be trans

ferred to a bank which does not
have a discriminatory hiring pol-
icy. Or face the rage of 5,38:
black workers rising up in angry

protest. ,

Always Racist

CONSISTENTLY RACIST

It was as late as 11159 that black
workers were allowed to work in
the assembly lones of depts.
M70 and 9|-3U at Hamtramck As-‘
sembly Plant. These work areas
had been exclusively white . Why‘?
These were the cleaner jobs in
the plant. Black brothers for yrs
had been pouring hot steel in the
foundry, welding in the body shop
and sweeping and cleaning lavato-
ries and floors. The white workers
not to mention management were
so racist that when the first black
brothers were brough to 9170 and
9l5~f) in l:.*:3;!, white workers stor-
med off of the lines en masse. and
many quit screaming, “we will not
work next to niggers." We are
talking about 1959, nine short
years ago. We are also talking
about white workers let alone the
white racist management. Any
workers whom have at least ten
years senority at Hamtratnck As-
sembly knows that this happened,
Black workers in the body shop
foundry and other depts. were sent
home from work because of a
sh ;tdown caused by white racist
workers over the issue of working
next to our black brothers. DRUM
is attempting to reveal that the ra-
cism that exists in this plant today
is no accident. It is not merely
a circumstantial thing; to the con-
trary, it is a systematic preplanned
conspi racy to reduce, keep and hold
black workers in a super-subjuga-

policy of Hamtramck assembly and

the larger Chrysler Corp. of which
it is a part is systematically and
consistently racist.

New Employees

DRUM would like to welcome you to
the Plantation. DRUM is the
Voice of Black Unity at Hamt ramck
Assembly. Hamtramck Assembly
is a Racist Arm of the Chrysler
Corporation. Look around you will
notice that most of supervision is
white and its the same in skill
trades. This situation has pre-
vailed too long. The older Black
employees through Drum a re mov —
ing to break this up. Black men
and women are given some of the
hardest and dirties jobs in this
plant. Upgrading for Black Em-
ployees goes like this,. he who
Best Kisses the Forrnan's Ass
will get the easist job on the
Assembly line, and thats it. We
feels that our struggle is to im-
prove conditions in this plant.
And now that you have been hired
we feel that you are part of this
struggle for black dignity.

open tense

DRUM at this timc feels that it
should state it's position since its
first published newsletter. Opposi-
tion has mounted among the white
bigots and Uncle Toms to stop
DRUM at all costs. DRUM would
like to clearly state that it will not
tolerate any more of this back
stabbing. The voice of black unity
must and will be heard. The warn-
ing is this, if you have something
to hide, watch out. Whites used to
tell us, "If you're black,get back."
DRUM says, “Get black, or get

back." If you are not thinking,

black at this late date, get black
or get back.

GUILTY ‘

GUILT COMPLE1

In ord.r for the white racist
foreman to carry out their Plama‘
ton tactics on the black workers,
they have presented the combany

with a new problem. These racists .

orders which are easily D8580‘!
on to others also cause gui1I_C0m‘
plexex to the actual executioner.
The white foremen at one time
did not fear the execution of these
orders given them by the high“
echelon of management. But due
to the existence of DRUM, and
black unity this has created a new
problem for Chrysler Corp.

Now management's racist man-
euvers cannot be carried out as
easily as before. Subsequently,
management set up a private park
ing lot so those white racist fore-
men who want to continue their
brutal racist oppression cansneak
in and out of the plant with pro-
tection at the metal; Chrysler
Corporation. DRUM has further
proof of pilferage from the plant
proper by these white foremen

who are allowed to drive in ands U;

of the plant at will, without being
searched under the guise that these
bigots are being protected from
black workers. While black work-
ers are searched with regularity
for merely walking in and out of
the plant. Since the validity of
DRUM is being questimed by Ma-
nagement and Local 3 officers
you ask your foreman where does
he park.
