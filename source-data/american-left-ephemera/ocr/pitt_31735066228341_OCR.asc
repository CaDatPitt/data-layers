  

is in the ways in which they developed. When the antiwar move-
ment came on the scene in 1965, it first expressed itself through
action: the teach-ins and the SDS march on Washington. The wom-
en's liberation movement started in a differentway. For two years
it functioned pretty much in what might be called an underground
manner. Although there were occasional, small, symbolic actions,
the participants spent most of the time in simply getting together
to discuss the oppression they felt as women. This was a prereq-
uisite to launching the movement, because the ideas being put
forward were so new and so controversial that it was necessary
for women to first discuss them and gain confidence in their cor-
rectness. For this reason, one of the most characteristic forms the
women's liberation movement has taken so far has been the small,
consciousness-raising group.

On such questions as consciousness-raising, instead of looking
for guides from the antiwar movement, we can learn more from
the rise of black nationalism. Women, like black people, are dis-
criminated against on the basis of their physical characteristics.
Both are said to be innately inferior—less intelligent, more emo-
tional, dependent, etc. And in both cases, there is a need to estab-
lish confidence and group solidarity, and to understand that the
source of the oppression lies with the system and not with any
innate failings.

The process of consciousness-raising the feminist movement is
going through today is much like the process the black movement
went through with the rise of nationalism and Malcolm X. In a
certain sense, Malcolm X was the original consciousness-raiser.
In his speeches he educated masses of people about all the ways
in which this system is stacked against black people, how black
people are divided and their dignity attacked. He spoke of the
psychological as well as the political and economic aspects of
black oppression. ‘

Through consciousness-raising groups, women come to grips
with the psychological as well as the economic aspects of female
oppression. We analyze all the various indignities that women
suffer every day—from the ogling on the streets to the high heels
that cripple our feet to the fact that we are supposed to take our
husband's name and cannot develop any real identity of our own.
Feminist consciousness-raising is something all women — and also
men—can learn from and benefit from, just as we all can learn
from the nationalist consciousness-raising of Malcolm X.

The feminist movement has also learned the necessity of building
independent, all-women's organizations from the black liberation
struggle. The women's liberation movement differs from the struggle
for black liberation in that women are not a national minority

10

 

 

or a people occupying a separate territory. We are not fighting
for national self-determination. But we do have the same need as
blacks for developing our own movement and our independent
power. Since our struggle is against a form of oppression that
only women experience, it is women who must determine how the
struggle will be carried out.

Still another thing we can learn from the experience of both the
antiwar and black movements is the importance of campus strug-
gles in spurring forward the movement as a whole. The experiences
of building the "Black University" and the "Antiwar University"
help us to see more clearly the potential of the "Women's Libera-
tion University." That is, the campus can become an organizing
center for women's liberation, and the facilities of the university
can be used to meet the needs of women, both on campus and in
the community.

Many of the demands of the campus women's movement have
been inspired by the struggles of black students. For example, in
response to the agitation of women students, there is now a bill
before the California state legislature which would require that the
percentage of women in state universities reﬂect the percentage of
women in the population as a whole. Other aspects of the women's
university include the demands for day-care centers, for birth—con-
trol and abortion clinics, for the ending of any university beauty
contests or other insults to the dignity of women, for women's
studies programs, and for the hiring of more women professors
and an end to discrimination against female campus workers.

The role of campus struggles is especially important, because
it is easier to mobilize support on campus. Victories for the move-
ment on campus can be used as an example for the more difficult
struggles in the community as a whole. The winning of free day
care on campus, for instance, can help set a precedent for broader
struggles for day care.

In the struggle to build a strong, autonomous women's liberation
movement, many of the same questions are being raised which
were debated in the black and antiwar movements, including such
questions as elitism, how to reach the working class, democracy
within the movement, and counterinstitutions and utopianism. One
of the most important of these questions is that of how to build
the feminist movement into a powerful mass movement, attracting
to its ranks masses of women, including working women and Third
World women.

One of the most common and fundamental mistakes made in
dealing with this question is the approach that says it is impossible
for the masses of working and Third World women to actually
be won to the women's liberation movement on the basis of their

11

  

oppression as women. According to this view, which is held by
many ex-SDS women in the movement, working women and black
women will radicalize mainly around the fight against their oppres-
sion as workers and blacks. Thus, in order to involve them in the
women's liberation movement, you must put less emphasis on
purely feminist issues.

Such a concept is basically an elitist one, because it assumes
that working women and black women are not capable of radi-
calizing around the same types of fundamental feminist issues that
affect middle-class women. It is similar to an elitist" conception
commonly expressed in the earlier days of the antiwar movement
by SDSers who used to argue that the war in Vietnam was far
too sophisticated and "abstract" an issue to interest workers. Work-
ers, they thought, were only interested in such things as "more
meat on the table," or issues such as rats and garbage collection.
These SDSers often abandoned the antiwar struggle completely and
went off to do community organizing around such "nitty-gritty"
issues. They had yet to learn that workers and Third World people
are also human beings, capable of radicalizing and reacting to
the same political issues as anybody else.

The ex—new-left women often berate the women's liberation move-
ment for not relating to working and Third World women, and
continually raise the question at meetings, "Why aren't there more
black women here?" At the same time, they have little conception
of how to build the women's liberation movement in a way which
will inspire masses of working and Third World women.

They don't understand black nationalism; that is, they don't
understand the simple fact that white women cannot organize and
lead black women and that black women will organize indepen-
dently. They do not see that the women's liberation movement
cannot substitute itself for the black liberation movement or deter-
mine the demands of this movement. Nor do they understand that
the main area where black women, Chicanas, students, middle-
class women, and working women can unite is in the struggle for
concrete demands that affect all women—that is, in action around
such things as child care, the right of women to control their own
bodies, and equal job opportunity.

The truth is that Third World women and working women suffer
the most from every form of female oppression. They are the most
economically dependent on their husbands (the alternative is often
welfare), they most often suffer the double exploitation of having
to hold two jobs—one in the home and one out of the home-
and they suffer most from the unavailability of abortions, and
from discrimination in education and employment. It is working
women who also suffer the most from being made into sex objects,

12

 

 

because they are compelled to take jobs, such as waitressing and
secretarial work, where a premium is placed on their sexuality.

The stand taken by the Communist Party and some ex-SDSers
against the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution is another
reflection of the lack of understanding of the potential power of
working women organized as women to fight for equal rights. It
shows that we must still fight to assert the full legitimacy of the
feminist movement. In no other struggle would it even be suggested
that a people should give up their basic constitutional right to
legal equality because the ruling class wi11—of course—try to dis-
tort the meaning of such rights. Instead, the tricks and distortions
of the ruling class (in this case its assertion that women must take
either equal rights or job benefits and protective laws) should be
exposed.

Job conditions and working hours are crucial questions for
working women, and the worst mistake the feminist movement
could make would be to go along with any idea that the struggle
for such things is contradictory to the struggle for equality on the
job. In fact, the only way we will win either decent job conditions
or equal rights on the job is by combining the two struggles.

Another issue that has been debated concerns the slogan "Fight
Male Chauvinism." This slogan is raised mainly by Progressive
Labor and is counterposed to the basic demands of the women's
liberation movement. Here we have an exact parallel with PL's
attitude toward the black movement, where they put forward the
slogan "Fight Racism" to hide the fact that they do not support
the basic demands of the movement—that is, such nationalist
demands as black control of the black community and the build-
ing of an independent black party.

The best way to fight male chauvinism is to build a mass in-
dependent women's liberation movement that has real power to
change society. Changes in the attitudes of masses of men will
come only through the mobilization of this power. There is no
reason to counterpose fighting male chauvinism to building a mass
women's movement.

Another debate within the movement which relates to our ability
to involve masses of women in struggle concerns the question
of "counterinstitutions." At the Socialist Scholars Conference last
spring, Roxanne Dunbar suggested that we in the movement should
work to set up our own abortion clinics, food cooperatives, and
child-care centers, and she countemosed this to the perspective of
mass struggle to demand that the government provide resources
for these things.

There are many different types of "counterinstitutions" in the
movement, such as collectives, abortion counseling services, and

13

  

movement child-care facilities. These often play the role of bringing
women together in a way which can build trust and help women
survive on a day-to-day level. But while such activities are a natural
outgrowth of the movement, they have very definite limits. They
cannot and should not substitute for our main struggle to unite
masses of women in making demands on the system as a whole.

The women's liberation movement does not have the resources
to provide abortions and day-care centers for the millions of wom-
en in this country who need them. Women's liberation does not
control the jobs which could provide equal employment and equal
pay. The ruling class controls these things. And the demands of ‘the
women's liberation movement must be directed against the ruling
class, must be directed toward regaining these resources, which
are being stolen from the vast majority of people who could benefit
from them.

Another debate that has come up concerns the organizational
questions of democracy, structure, and leadership. One position
in the movement has been that any democratically chosen leader-
ship or structure for meetings constitutes "elitism." Ironically, it is
often those women who are most vocal in their opposition to any
democratic structure or procedure and who claim to be against
"elitism" who end up as the worst kinds of bureaucrats, trying
to enforce their will on others or making decisions behind the
backs of others.

One of the worst instances of this was at the second Congress
to Unite Women in New York, where a minority of women suc-
ceeded in completely breaking up the conference by insisting that
the whole congress discuss only the points they were interested in
and nothing else. They insisted that voting on a chairwoman,
voting on an agenda, or taking votes at all were all "male forms
of organization" and therefore unacceptable.

When attempts were made to decide the question democratically,
the women in this group simply disrupted with shouting and
screaming—which was presumably not a ''male'' form of domina-
tion. What became clear at this conference was that it was the mi-
nority that shouted the loudest that ended up making the decisions.

Whether men, women, or both are responsible for democratic
norms is irrelevant. The fact is that democracy is the best way a
movement can make decisions. Already, as a result of such expe-
riences as the Congress to Unite Women, the taking of votes, the
structuring of organizations, and the election of chairwomen has
become standard procedure in most areas of the country. Women
are beginning to realize that it is a fact of life that disagreements
are going to arise in the movement and that the only way ques-
tions can be solved democratically is through a structure that will
insure majority rule.

Another question which is being debated concerns the role which
socialists can play in building the feminist movement. One view is
that the movement must be socialist if it is to be effective. This
opinion was expressed at the second Congress to Unite Women
by some of the women from International Socialists (IS). They
argued that the whole congress should adopt socialism as its goal.

What these women did not see was that large gatherings such
as the Congress to United Women or actions such as the August

. 26, 1970, marches and rallies are needed to unite as many women

as possible around concrete demands we can all agree on. If such
activities were organized on the basis of support for socialism,
this would exclude the masses of women who are newly becoming
aware of their oppression as women.

Confusion on this question stems from a lack of understanding
that different types of organizations are needed to serve different
functions. Independent women's organizations are needed to mobi-

lize and unite masses of women in an uncompromising fight for

women's liberation, and a revolutionary socialist party is needed
to fight along with such organizations, helping to win them to a
revolutionary perspective, while working at the same time to coor-
dinate, unite and give leadership to all the independent, anticapi-
talist movements which are developing within our society. Only
such a party will be capable of leading decisive struggles against
the capitalist system—struggles which are necessary if the goals
of women's liberation are to be realized.

The Young Socialist Alliance and Socialist Workers Party are
working to build both a mass independent women's liberation
movement and at the same time a revolutionary socialist move-
ment which includes both men and women and people of all na-
tionalities.

We see these tasks as separate, yet totally interrelated. The things
we have learned as socialists, as builders of the antiwar, black,
Chicano, student, and other movements, have equipped us to be
better builders of the feminist movement. At the same time, we rec-
ognize that it is by actively participating in mass movements like
these that people become convinced of the need for socialism.

We believe that the independent women's liberation movement
is a powerful revolutionary force in and of itself. It is an inspiring
and exciting movement precisely because, in a unique way, it gets
to the root of what is wrong with this society. When masses of
women, who represent 51 percent of the population, become con-
scious of their oppression and begin to move against it, it will
shake this system to its roots. ’

SISTERHOOD IS POWERF UL

The rise of the women's liberation movement has been one of the
more sudden and dramatic of all the radical changes taking place
in this country today. As recently as two years ago, most people
in this country hadn't even heard of women's liberation. Now, es-
pecially in the past five or six months, women's liberation groups
have sprung up all over: there are groups on the campuses and
in the high schools; small groups in the communities; black. wom-
en's liberation groups; older women's groups; and women's cau-
cuses in professional organizations, churches, and unions. And I
am told that in the Bay Area there is even a grade-school female
liberation group now, made up of sixth-graders.

For us to have an accurate evaluation of the potential of this
movement, we must understand clearly the conditions and changes
which have brought it into being and which have infused it with
such militancy.

We should understand first of all that the women's liberation
movement is a product of the broader radicalization taking place
in the U. S. today. The black liberation movement in particular,
with its concepts of black power, all—black organization, and black
consciousness, helped to create a climate conducive to the rise of
feminist consciousness. Had it not been for the pioneering role of
the black movement, women would have had to fight much, much
harder for the right to form their own groups, composed of women
only. They would have been charged much more often with being
"men-haters," just as black nationalists were first charged with being
simply antiwhite.

The slogan "Sisterhood Is Powerful" reﬂects the self-identity, pride,
and feeling of group consciousness that has also been so important
in the struggle for black liberation. This sense of group identity
and of common oppression represents a giant step forward for
women, who have traditionally been the most divided, dispersed,
and brainwashed of all the oppressed groups in our society. Women
have not only been isolated from each other in individual house-
holds, but they have also been pitted against each other in compe-
tition for men. This competitive struggle has in many cases com-
pletely alienated women from each other as friends and human
beings.

An example of the way capitalism exploits this division can be

3

 

seen in a recent ad for Orbach's department store in New York.
At the top of the ad was the question: "Do you hate your best
friend?" And then, below, it said, "You're smarter than she is.
And just as pretty. But when you go away on weekends together,
men ski down the slope with you. And sit by the fire with her."
Orbach's has a solution to the problem: "Come on into Orbach's
yourself. And start your best friend hating you."

At this conference, we have talked a great deal about how people
under capitalism are conditioned to internalize problems which are
really problems of society as a whole. Again, women are the great-
est victims of this type of self-blame. Of all the oppressed groups, it
is we who have been most completely convinced that if we fail to
find happiness through marriage and the family, then something
is basically wrong with us. We have failed as women. We have
committed the ultimate crime of not living up to the standard of
femininity.

And what is this femininity? It is the sum total of all the traits
which have been traditionally characteristic of a slave mentality.
It means such things as dependence, stupidity, helplessness, obse-
quiousness. It means you are always there when your master
needs you. And whenever we have attempted to step outside of this
stereotype—to be aggressive, to think for ourselves, to try to live
as independent, whole human beings—we have been pushed back
into line with charges that we are "unfeminine," or "a bunch of
frustrated women," or lesbians.

But now the consciousness of broad layers ofwomen is changing
and such charges are losing their effect. For the first time, women
are beginning to do as they please, dress as they please, and act
as they please. The rise of black nationalism, with its questioning
of every aspect of society, was key in creating a political climate
in which such deep prejudices about women could be unmasked.
But in addition to this, the women's liberation movement is arising
because of specific contradictions faced by women today.

One of the most obvious of these is the contradiction between in-
creased female education and the continuing discrimination against
women entering the job market, who are still channeled into the
most tedious, low—paying jobs. In 1967, the number of women
enrolled in college was six times the 1950 enrollment. There is also
an unprecedented number of women entering the job market. The
Wall Street Journal recently reported that from 44 to 48 percent
of American women are either employed or actively looking for
jobs. This is higher than in any previous period, including World
War II. It is a qualitative jump from the early 1960s, when the
figure was 38 percent, and from the middle 1950s, when it was
down to 35 percent. With the rising cost of living and increased

4

——~ ~—-$A——u> —— -

 

 

A —'—4--ﬂaw’ —— -

unemployment, the percentage of women trying to enter the labor
force continues to climb.

Most women are taking jobs out of economic necessity, and the
second paycheck they bring home is often vital to maintaining the
family above the poverty level. Also, a large number of women
are heads of households or are living alone, so that their pay is
the only money coming in. Thus, a significant number of women
occupy an economic position today much different from that of
the 1950s, when the "feminine mystique" was in full sway. And the
old conception that the wages of women are peripheral to the
family income—which was always a false conception—is being
further undermined.

Another contradiction women face today is the dichotomy between
the potential they see for controlling their own bodies and the
denial of this control that is the effect of reactionary abortion laws
and the lack of safe, easily available contraception. The develop-
ment of the pill, despite its limitations, for the first time gave women
a feeling that they can and should take control over their own
futures. The pill was also an impetus to the sexual revolution in
that it allowed women a larger degree of sexual freedom.

But at the same time, the sexual revolution opened the way for
an even cruder exploitation of women as sex objects, reﬂected in
such things as the topless mania, pornographic art films, and
more exploitative advertising. The increased sexual freedom made
women even more conscious of the inequalities between men and
women in personal and sexual relationships.

The sexual ‘revolution has also been partly responsible for the
growing crisis in the one institution that has been most responsible
for keeping women down—the family. Huge changes are taking
place in the sexual mores of this country, changes which are un-
dermining the traditional "sanctity" of marriage and which are
reflected in such things as the rising divorce rate and the continuing
trend toward more people living together without being married.
Another aspect of the breakdown of the family system has been
the undermining of the authority of parents and the development
of what is commonly called the generation gap.

The profound changes in the economic functioning of the family
in this country have been even more fundamental to its breakdown
than either the sexual revolution or the generation gap. The family
institution, which was once a basic productive unit of society, has
been steadily losing its productive functions, throughout the whole
past century, and has become more and more a unit of consump-
tion. This means that whereas most families used to grow their
own food, bake their own bread, make their clothes, and churn
their butter—these things are now mass—produced, cooperatively,

  

outside the home. Along with this process, what used to be family
farms and family businesses have been displaced by gigantic in-
dustrial complexes.

This trend reached its most advanced stage in the past few de-
cades, with the development of modern appliances, packaged foods,
cleaning aids, and other conveniences that have narrowed the
role of the housewife to such functions as care of the very young
and very old and janitorial and cooking tasks around the house.
This, coupled with the fact that the average American woman is
having fewer children, has meant that for a greater period of each
woman's life, her role consists only of caring for her own and
her husband's personal needs.

On the other hand, if a housewife decides to go to work outside
the home, she suffers double exploitation: on the job she gets less
pay and has more limited job opportunity than her husband; and
at home she faces another major job maintaining the house. For
working women with small children—a growing category—this
double burden is especially oppressive.

These contradictions are the basis for such women's liberation
demands as free child-care centers, free food preparation and dis-
tribution facilities, free laundry facilities and cleaning services.
And this is one of the most revolutionary aspects of the women's
liberation movement. Women are beginning to put forward de-
mands whose logic is the replacement of the family as an economic
unit by creating alternatives to it.

Such demands as free child care and free medical care give
impetus to the revolutionary concept that this society, the wealthiest
society in the world, should use its resources to provide for all its
members equally. For when you say that society should be re-
sponsible for education of the very young, for the care of the sick,
for food and clothing and care of the aged, what you are really
talking about is socialism. You are talking about measures that
would spell the end of class society, about measures that would
end the class differences in the kind of education, medical care,
food, clothing, and opportunities for advancement available to
different individuals.

One of the reasons why the women's liberation movement is
projecting such a radical reordering of society, including the so-
cialization of the economic functions now forced upon the family,
is that the whole expansion of wealth and technology has made
alternatives to the family seem more possible and reasonable.
Even a decade ago such things as free food, free child care, free
laundries, and free medical care would have seemed completely
utopian to most. But now, with billions being poured into the war
in Southeast Asia and trips to the moon, and with the growing

-nu-pr

 

 

*--v-.-

recognition of the wastefulness of capitalist society, such things
seem quite within the realm of reason.

The questioning of the family as an economic unit and the real-
ization that there are alternatives to it have been most responsible
for the radicalism and confidence expressed by the feminist move-
ment today. That is because the family system is the basic institu-
tion which perpetuates the oppression women experience as women.
The role of women in the home is the key rationalization for dis-
crimination on the job, in education, and in every other area of
society. It is through the family that we are taught from infancy
that women are the child-raisers and dishwashers of society, while
men are the achievers, builders, artists, scientists, athletes, politi-
cians, and architects.

This does not mean that we raise as a slogan of the movement:
"Down With The Family!" We understand that the family will exist
so long as no better institutions for companionship and care of
human beings come into existence. At the same time, because it is
impossible for women to fully understand the nature of their op-
pression without understanding the family system, it is very im-
portant to educate on this question. We must explain that the family
is fundamentally an economic institution. The ruling class always
tries to hide the economic basis by equating the family with "love.['
They try to imply that if you take away the family, love and com-
panionship will disappear. -

We have to point out the hypocrisy of this. We have to show how
the family destroys all possibility of genuinely human relationships,
because in this society family relationships are based on economic
compulsion. Millions of women and children in this society are
living with men or parents they dislike—and the feeling is often
mutual—because women and children and old people are econom-
ically dependent on a man and feel they have no real alternative.
What women's liberation wants to do is end such compulsory
relationships.

This growing understanding of the family is partially responsible
for the fact that the women's liberation movement has gone beyond
the position taken by some of the more conservative women in
the movement, whose approach has been that of bringing women
into what they call the "mainstream" of American society. Right
from the beginning, the women's liberation movement was founded
on a principle similar to that articulated by black nationalists,
namely, that we don't want to be integrated into the mainstream
of this rotten, decadent society. Nor do we want to be like men,
or to trade places with men. Instead, we want to end all traditional
roles and divisions of labor based on sex and to create a new way
of life where each person can determine for herself or himself how

 

  

they want to spend their lives. What we are talking about is a rev-
olution so deep-going in its implications that it is hard for those of
us living in capitalist society to totally grasp what it would be like.

The ideology of present-day feminism represents a step forward
for the struggle of women equal in importance to the step taken
by the black movement when it went from civil rights to national-
ism. And the implications for the American revolution are just as
important. Not only is the feminist movement radical, but it is also
potentially a very powerful movement—one which can involve
millions of women, including working women, Third World wom-
en, and older women, as well as the younger women who have
been most important in sparking it.

Although most women are not yet familiar with or in agreement
with all the basic ideas of the women's liberation movement, there
is hardly a woman alive who does not already support one or
another of the basic demands of the movement. An indication of
this is the issue of abortion. For years now, abortion reformers
have been trying to get more humane abortion policies in this
country with very little success. Only with the rise of the women's
liberation movement, which for the first time demanded the basic
right of women to control their own bodies, do we see gains being
made. This would not be happening if the masses of women in
this country did not support the right of abortion.

Equal pay and job opportunity are also demands that masses
of women support. One indication of this is the number of indi-
vidual women who on their own have filed complaints against
sex discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunities Com-
mission under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In the past year,
25 percent of the 17,000 complaints filed were against discrimina-
tion on the basis of sex. The struggles over the equal pay bill in
England also show the potential in this area. In 1968, there was
a major strike by English Ford factory seamstresses demanding
equal pay for doing the same work as men.

All the demands raised by the women's liberation movement-
free 24-hour child care, equal pay, the right of women to control
their own bodies, free medical care, paid maternity leaves, equal
education— all these demands deal concretely with problems faced
by masses of women, most particularly working and Third World
women. And these are demands that have very radical implications,
because they challenge the basic premises of the private property
system.

The women's liberation movement is a new movement, unlike
any other movement we have seen, which has a revolutionary
dynamic all its own. It is not like the union movement, or the
antiwar movement, or the black movement, or the women's rights

movement of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. At the
same time, there are certain lessons from the experiences of build-
ing other movements which can be applied to the feminist move-
ment.

From the antiwar movement we can learn the power of mass
action and the importance of making the movement visible through
actions and demonstrations which unite as many women as pos-
sible around such demands as child care, abortion, and equal pay.
Such mass action is key to building the feminist movement into a
mass movement. It is the best way to express the power of the
movement, and it is essential to the process of bringing into the
movement large numbers of women who may be newly radical-
izing over one or another of the women's liberation demands.

But there are also big differences between the antiwar movement
and the women's liberation movement. The antiwar movement is
built about a single issue: the war in Vietnam. The feminist move-
ment is much broader in scope because it involves not just one
issue but the oppression of an entire sex. Women are 51 percent
of the population, and there is very little that goes on that doesn't
concern us in some way. Thus, we must work toward developing
a program and an approach that deals with all the various ques-
tions and issues which concern women-questions such as black
nationalism, the war, the struggle for better working conditions,
better medical facilities, and so forth. In other words, as the wom-
en's liberation movement grows, it will be dealing with all the
types of oppression women experience— as workers, as black wom-
en, as Chicanas, as students, as youth, as housewives.

At the Third World women's panel this week, we discussed how
the women's liberation movement, if it is to relate to Third World
women, must gain some understanding of nationalism. We dis-
cussed the fact that while black and white women will be able to
unite together in building mass actions around specific demands,
black women will need their own separate women's liberation
organizations because the overall oppression they experience is
different.

A lot of education must take place within the women's liberation
movement on the question of nationalism. There were some women
in the New York women's center, for example, who at first did
not understand the necessity for building a separate black women's
movement and who took the position that the Third World Wom-
en's Alliance shouldn't be allowed to meet at the center because
the group excluded white women. We have to explain that there
are good reasons for them to exclude white women, just as there
are good reasons for excluding men from feminist groups.
