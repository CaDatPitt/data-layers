Warning to Steel Union Raiders

 

' BUTTE, Mont.—Members of
four Mine-Mill locals in this state
have delivered a smashing blow
to the CIO ‘Steel raiders. The

blow was in the form of an al-
most record-breaking majority
,vote in favor of a Mine-Mill
Union Shop in elections conduct-

Led by the NLRB.

While the issue in the ballot-
lng among Ansconda Mining Co.
Workers was nothing more nor.
less than union shop, the CIO
Steel Union raiders had stepped
up their campaign activities—
and expenditures—to new peaks
as the election dates were set.

The presence of the Steel raid-
ers in Montana, and the persis-
tent rumors that Steel Union
agents were urging Mine-Mill
workers to vote “N o” in the elec-
tion, gave the balloting some
signs of a contest between Mine-
All labor observ-
ers here interpreted the resuits
as a blunt warning to Steel to
“Keep Out.”

The election results showed
that of the 6,898 workers who
voted in the four local elections,
93.3 per cent were in favor of a
Mine-Mill Union Shop type of
union security. The figures break
down this way:

BUTTE MINERS UNION NO. 1
3,428 “Yes” 93.4% '
 (‘N019 _
BUTTE -ENGINEERS UNION
No.-82
256 “Yes” 94.8%
14 “N0”:
ANACONDA MILL & SMEL-

TERMEN’S UNION NO.
117. '

1,753 “Yes” 91.3%_
166 “No”
GREAT FALLS MINE & SMEL-
TERMENJB UNION NO. 16

975 “Yes” 93.6%
66 “NO”

The extremely high, turn-out of
workers in all four elections was

taken as a further indication that
Montana ACM employees were
determined to make their warn-
ing, to Steel as dramatic as pos-
sible.

Mine-Mill officials in Montana
pointed out that the overwhelm-
ing vote will greatly strengthen
the union’s negotiators when the
ACM- Mine-Mill Bargaining
Council presents its wage and
contract demands this spring.

The high vote was also con-
sidered a tribute to the union
solidarity' and understanding of
Montana miners and smeltermen.
This state has traditionally
fought for the Union Shop, as
opposed to the Open Shop, and
workers here are’still fervently
loyal to that tradition. It was re-
called that before the Taft-Hart-
ley Act was passed, Montana
ACM locals had insisted on the
Union Shop in their contracts
for many years.

John Clark, International union pres-
ident, who was in Great Falls for- the

election there, .« expressed particular

Vol. 9. No. 25

pleasure over the results because he
is a long-time member of Mill & Smel-
termen’s Local 16. Clark visited the
East Helena local Friday, and was due
to return to Great Falls in time for the
conference of delegates from all Ana-
conda locals in Montana March 16 and
17.

Travis hails union

shop voting score

WASHINGTON -— Records of the
NLRB show that 3,494,379 workers
voted for the union shop in board elec-
tions during 1948, 1949 and 1950 under
the Taft-Hartley slave labor law. ’
' Maurice E. Travis,‘ Mine-Mill Inter-
national secretary-treasurer, hailed the
record as a complete denial of the
charge by Sen. Robert A. Taft .(R, O.)
that workers want “freedom from un-
ions.” Travis pointed out that Taft
and his friends in the NAM wrote the
union shop proviso into the law in the
hope of wrecking unionism.

“The union-busting tactics of Taft
have cost the government three million
dollars in election costs and have re-
sulted in injustices’ to millions of
workers through refusal of the ‘board

to hold elections and through stalling,” .

Travis declared. .

AS&R council
to meet March 27

DENVER, Colo. —- All Mine-
Mill locals in the AS&R Council
were notified in a letter sent out
last week that the Council will
meet here March 27 at the Cos-
mopolitan Hotel.

The letter. signed by M. E.
Travis, Council chairman, and
Silverio Alva, secretary, pointed
out that the meeting will be held
the day before the 1951 Mining,
Smelting and Refining Confer-
ence “which will map out a co-
ordinated strategy for negotia-
tions this year.”

AS&R locals were urged to send
delegates for their Council meet-
ing and the following Mining
Smelting and Refining parley.

In Denver. March 28
Mining, smelling, 
reﬁning parley set ‘

DENVER, Colo.—Plans have now
been completed for the annual meeting
of the Mine-Mill Mining, Smelting and
Refining Conference, according to an
announcement last week by Internation-
al president John Clark and vice pres-
ident Orville Larson.

The sessions will take place in the
Cosmopolitan Hotel here, March 28 and
29. Clark and Larson urged those lo-
cals which are not affiliated with a
bargaining council to send their own
delegates to the conference. '

Calling attention to the difference
between the 19.51 bargaining picture
and that of recent years, the president
and vice president said that “in addi-
tion to preparing our bargaining pro-
posals and mapping the strategy of,
negotiations, we have to join with

- other sections of the labor movement

to defeat the attempt to place the full’
burden of the armaments program on
the shoulders of the workers.”

weren’t willing to swap or good brawl
for Mr. Wilson’s armwaving.
But this sacrifice turned out to be a

demanded by Wilson, if any of the fans

bothered to listen. If they d1d, they

might have got a little madder. »
‘Here was a man whose corporation’s

‘profits run into fabulous ‘hundreds of

they wind up in the bank accounts of

of our U. S. economy.

Already, according to Economic Sta-/,

fense” dollars have gone down the
drain because of higher prices cliarged
to the government by these big outfits
who are busy whooping it up for the

The so-called controls tell the real
story. Even thoughuprices were pegged
at the highest point in history, they
are still going up and price officials
predict they_will go up still another
five per cent. \ I

But wages? They are frozen solid,
and your only chance of a wage in-
crease is if you haven’t gotten a 10%
raise since Jan. 15, 1950. According to
this formula, Mine Mill members w-on’t
have a cent coming, in most cases. In
fact, we’ll owe the bosses money.

.Because of this unfair formula, the I

labor members did right in walking out
of the Wage Stabilization Board and
they shouldn’t go back just for another
2‘/o. added to the formula—a matter
of only two ‘or three cents. Labor
should unite to demand free collective
bargaining and a real roll-back of
prices,_\.and at the same time a tax pro-
gra_m on big business to take the profits
out of war. .

That’s Mine Mil1’s program for real
equality of sacrifice.

M-M organizes.
new properties

DENVER, Colo.—Mine-Mill was en-
gaged in vigorous organizing cam-
paigns last week at several important
spots in the United States and Canada.

A hearing was expected before the
Ontario Labor Board shortly on the
Mine-Mill application for certification
at the Bishop Asphalt & Paper Co. at
Mimico, Ontario. A

A meeting with the -management of
Federal Mining Co. at Mullan, Idaho,
had been requested to demand recogni-.
tion {of Mine-Mill as the bargaining
agent for workers at the Galena Mine.

Application for certification was
made at Calgary, where the workers

at Gypsum Lime & Alabastine Canada ‘

Ltd., have been organized into 3. Mine-
Mill local. "

Recognition has already been won
by Western Mechanics Local 700 at the
Western Lead Co. in Los Angeles. Ne- .
gotiations are in progress for a first
contract.

Organizing was also being pressed
at Ray-Sonora, Arizona, where miners
have asked Mine-Mill to bring them
into a good union that will fight for
their demands.

,pgBrass workers ask Connecticut
‘ governor's help in job fight 

Dichter. The delegation would have
been much larger had it not been for
a snow storm which made many roads
in the state impassable.

At the conclusion -of the conference
the Governor indicated that he would
write to both IWilson and Harrison and
urge immediate action to help ease the
situation. .

The situation in the brass industry
would have, been critical were it not
for some of thes'changes‘ recently
forced by the Union. Within the past
few weeks the National_ Production
Authority has eased the ban on the
production of brass and copper tubing
and the Munitions Board has cut the
stockpilingof copper by 50%.

The Union is ﬁghting for a complete
revision of the present copper program
imposed by Washington, in line with
the recommendations. of the Interna-
tional - executive board of Mine-Mill.
Unless further changes are made the
employment situation will continueto
remain spotty and no -brass worker will
have assurance of full week’s work.

fight on wage-price freeze . —

CHICAGO -——The annual convention
of Chicago Amalgamated Local 758
took a strong stand against the wage-
price—tax squeeze of the Truman war
mobilization plan. The delegates voted
“to consistently resist any and every
move to rob us of our rﬁglzt to collec-
tive bargaz'm'ng, on wages and other
conditions of employment and over-
time pay (in cash money) for all
overtime work performed, and we as
trade unionists will not perform over-

time work unless overtime pay con-A

tinn‘es.” .
Other resolutions dealt with—-
PEACE: “Rather than continue the‘wild
gamble of a third world war, and the
livesiof millions of American boys,

we urge President Truman and our’

government to cease using the Amer-
ican taxpayers money, through its
Marshall Plan and otherwise to in-
cite war, but call upon the United
Nations to carry out the work for
which it was formed, not to make
war, but guarantee peace to the world
. . . we condemn, theuse of atomic
weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction.” .
NEGRO RIGHTS: “This Local shall
' more vigorously than ever defend the
civil liberties of-the Negro people
and other minoritygroups, giving
full support to the fight for passage
of an FEPC law . . . goes on “record
for launching a local-wide plant by
plant fight for the adoption and car-
rying into practice of a model FEPC
clause. . .” Provisions of a model
,FEPC'clause are listed in the reso-
lution.

“MERIT” SYSTEMS: “Elimination of

ANSON IA, Conn.—Connecticut locals

. ‘be introduced in Congress to compen-
. sate any worker who loses time or is
laid off as a result of the so—called De-
fense Program. _ I _
The bill, drawn up" by Attorney
‘Nathan’ Witt,‘ calls for an appropriation
of $100,000,000 to be set aside for that
purpose. A brass worker would receive
a full week’s pay from the State Un-

of the fact that he has been laid off or
has lost time from a normal work week /
as a result of the directives laid down
by Washington. , «-

The" tempo ~*of the drive to
smash civil rights in America
’has been rising steadily ever
since the outbreak " of war in
Korea. So has the strength of
the forces fighting to preserve
.. and extend civil rights.

One of the early big casualties
of the Korean". conflict was the
shelving of prbposals for an

3 FEPC law, an anti-lynch law, an
anti-poll tax law and other civil
right plans made in the now—famous
“Civil Rights Program” to which Pres-
ldent Truman‘ attache i‘.'is- name.

The death knell of plans for early
enactment of civil rights legislation
was sounded by the man who has
claimed to be the outstanding sup-
porter of the bil1s—President Truman
himself.

CLIPPINGS FROM the New York
_Times, re-printed on this page, show

that, President Truman has made it
clear that he has, in effect, dumped
the whole civil rights program in order
to get the support of Republican and

Dixiecrat Congressmen and Senators
for his “national emergency” program.

The clippings list among the items
dumped by the White House from its
legislative calendar: pledges that
Taft-Hartley will berepealed, promises
that the poll tax ‘will be outlawed, a
genuine FEPC law passed, and the full
weight of the Administration put be-
hind a drive to end Jim Crow in the
government and armed‘ services.

Meantime‘, the House of Representa-

tives in Washington last ‘week passed a ,.

bill modifying the _law in order to al-
low entry into this country of “invol-
untary” fascists and Nazis. It was're-

called that almost every one of’ the top ,

Nazi industrialists and Army leaders
used the. “involuntary” argument in

. their war crimes trials.

* Krupp, the man who did more than

any other tonput Hitler into power in
Germany,‘ and who headed the giant
Krupp munitions’ empire, was freed
from prison on orders from U. S. High
Commissioner John J. McCloy. Krupp
had been convicted in the famous Nur-
emberg War [Guilt trials; his sentence
had 12 more years to run. But McCloy
said he could go free.

Less than a week before Krupp was
released, seven Negroes were executed
in Martinsville, Virginia, on frame-up
charges that they raped a white wom-
an. It was another example of Jim

, Crow justice.

LESS THAN A WEEK later, Dr.
W. E.’ B. DuBois, one of America's
most outstanding citizens, was arrested
on framed-up charges of acting as a
“foreign agent.” Scholar, author, lec-
turer, DuBois was U. S. Minister to
Liberia not so long ago.

Meantime, the new trial of six Tren-
ton, N. J., Negroes has begun. For
nearly three years these men have been
in prison, accused of a murder, despite
cl_ear cut evidence they were’ far from

the scene of the crime when it was
committed.» The trial was ordered by

the N. J. Supreme Court on grounds‘

that the prosecution had suppressed

’ ‘evidence. in the first trial. Now the

prosecution continues stubbornly to

produce the evidence, although there is
proof they have it.

The Tuskegee Institute of Alabama
reports that there were nine attempted
lynchings during 1950 —- and one of
them was in a Northern state.

Gov. James Byrnes of South ‘Caro-
olina tells a reporter that “We need
have no fear that segregatimz in this
state’s public schools will be abol-
ished. We will find a. lawful way of
educating all of South Ca/rolina’s
children and at the same time pro-
viding sepa/rate. schools.” Byrnes was
the first U. S. Secretary of State ap-
pointed by Harry Truman when he
became President. ’

But-—as other civil rights stories on

this page show—the people are‘fight-'

ing back, every step of the way, in a
militant attempt to protect and defend

4 their civil rights.

NAACP lawyer hits MacArthur

NEV\LYORK—Gen. Douglas MacAr-

_ The NAACP attorney spent six

Open last-ditch A .
fight for McGee    

The nation-wide fight to save the
life of Willie McGee, framed up by
Mississippi Jim Crow justice, last week
was moving toward a‘ climax as the
March 20 execution date drew near.

An urgent appeal to all llline-Mill
locals went out over the signatures of ‘
International president John Clarkhand ’
the members of the union’s minority
rights committee, including chairman
Raymond Dennis, and Chesley Smother-
mon, Alton Lawrence and Mike Solski. ‘-

The appeal pointed out that .McGee~
will be executed next Tuesday “unless
there is a storm of protest against this
legal lynching!” It urged a campaign
of letters, telegrams and petitions to V
President Truman and to Mississippi
Governor Fielding Wright -demanding
that the execution be stayed and that
McGee be granted a full pardon.

ATREMENDOUS WAVE of public
protest has been aroused by this fla-‘_
grant frame-up case. A delegation of 
civil rights supporters from 10 north-
ern states last spring managed to ob-
tain an audience with Governor Wright .
and persuade him to stay the execu-
tion. Since then, the Civil Rights Con-
gress has unearthed important new
evidence which it hopes to presentin
appeals for a final stay of execution.
and pardon. .

Appeals to Gov. Wright have come _
from every corner of the_ world, from __
most of the United States, from people ‘
in all walks of life, from trade unions A
and religious groups, workers, civil
leaders and professionals. _ ‘

n Governor Wright said arrogantly
last week: “There won’t be any hear’-
ing granted to any persons coming
down here from other states. And I
would say to any would-be benefactors n
that they might as well save their ' ”
money on telegrams or any other type 
of activity directed to influence me." . -

It was recalled that another ‘South-
ern politician —— ex-Governor Millard"?
Caldwell of Florida—was recently hon- : _'
ored by President Truman, who placed  V
him at the head of the nation’s civil ‘V
defense program. ' __ A

Eleven major Australian unions have, ,  
sent cables protesting theframe-up of ‘ A l”-
McGee. They wired: “Emphatically ""5; .j
protest attempted legal lynching of the .‘~_7‘J:
Trenton Six Negroes and the Negro '  _
war veteran, Willie McGee. We demand ’ ."_. '
they all be freed and all forms of rac ' ‘ "
cial discrimination ended in the inter-
est of international peace, freedom, and ‘
democracy.” -

The message was signed by the Wa-
terside Workers Federation, Seamen’l
Union, Ironworkers Federation", Sheet '
Metal Wofkers, Clerks Union, Engi- it
necrs Union, Miners Federation, Build-
ing Workers Union, Postal Workers _
Union, Boilermaker’s Union and Hotel.

VBOYCOTT CUTS PRICES. Angry
housewives force some retailers to

from 99c to 89c.

Meat sales hit

by a boycott _‘

NEW YORK (FP) -— In a rapidly
spreading boycott campaign, America’s
housewives are rebelling against meat

prices frozen by the government at‘

sky-high levels. '

Meat slaughterers and retail food and
butéher shops in major cities report a
sharp drop in sales, particularly on the
more expensive cuts like steaks and
chops. Some are voluntarily cutting
prices, but not enough to lure house-
wives back to the meat counters in
large numbers. '

A spokesman for the Metropolitan
Slaughterers Assn. in New York said
there had been a 30% drop in ‘meat

-sales in 10 days. A survey by the Wall
Street Journal showed dwindling meat
sales throughout the nation.

Retail stores checked by the news-
paper reported sales had fallen off an
average of 7% to 10%. At the whole-
sale level, even more drastic declines
appeared. A Boston wholesaler, Omaha
"Packing Co., reported a 60% drop in
one week. A 35% drop was registered
by the Arnold Packing Co., a small
Pittsburgh wholesale firm.

The retailers all agreed that higher
priced cuts were bearing the brunt of
the campaign. A spokesman for a big
Dallas grocery chain said housewives
were shunning steaks in favor of ‘pork
and poultry. “Some of our customers
say they’re eating so much poultry
now, they cackle when they get up in
the morning,” he said.

No meat shortage was involved in
the price holdup. At the end of Janu-
ary there was a commercial cold stor-
age supply of -1,046,000,000 pounds of
meat, nearly 11% above the year-
earlier level. In- ‘addition, the U. S.
._Agricultural Department says that

-‘prospects are for a larger meat pro-
duction in 1951 than in 1950.”,

Y   or $2% million 

DETROIT (FP)—The General Mo-.<
, tors Corp., biggest, manufacturing en-

terprise in the world, made $2,285,052
in net profits every single day last
year.

Its profits after taxes for the en-
tire year of 1950 were $834,044,039.
Its stockholders “earned” $9.35 a share.
Anyway you slice it, the GM 1950 profit

1' story is the most fabulous ever told

in American financial history, '.
Magnitude of the corporation’s prof-
its last year can be seen from compar-
isons with other firms. GM profits
were over 100% «ahead of the next
highest profit-maker in the U. S. They

‘ were $48 million higher than the com-

bined profits of all 125 Class I rail-
roads in the nation. .

GM’s net profits last year showed a
27% increase over the previous year’s
profits, which also -broke all corpora-
tion records. It made the leap although
its tax bill increased almost 100% in
the same period. f

The company paid out almost as
much in taxes in 1950-$1,119,000,000
-—as it did in total wages and salaries
-—$1,809,218,043. ‘

The corporation has backlog war or-
ders of over $3 ‘billion,- not including

amounts to be spent for new facilities.

About two-thirds of the $3 billion in

contracts was awarded the firm after.

Dec. 16, 1950, when President Truman
proclaimed a state of emergency.

Jersey loealpress
rollback campaign

NEWARK, N. J.-—Members of New
Jersey locals‘ of Mine-Mill were “tell-
ing it to Congress” in strong language
last week, as their campaign against
the government wage freeze moved
toward a climax. .. ‘

Wage-price-tax petitions were being
circulated in shops around the state,
with reports indicating that rank-and-
filers were responding enthusiastically
to the idea of presenting their “beef”
in the form‘ of a “Grievance” addressed
to President Truman.

Petitions with over 400 names on
them were turned in by the Garwood
Alcoa local‘ 702, less than two weeks
after the campaign began. Delegates
from the Garwood local also inter-
viewed Congressman Clifford P. Case,
(R, N. J.), who admitted that the pres-
ent wage-price freeze is a “lousy sit-
uation.” “You're doing exactlypright
with~z/our petitions,” he said. “People
should squalwk to the high heavens
about this.”

Workers at) U. S. Metals in Carteret
had already turned in more than 900
signatures, and more forms were com-
ing in every day. Additional hundreds
were coming in to Local 365 from the
AS&R plant in Perth Amboy..

A membership meeting of Vulcan
Detinning Local 521*A went on record
condemning the wage freeze, demand-
ing a price rollback to pre-Korean war
levels, and endorsing the “grievance”
petition campaign. ' '

‘Before leaving the Board, however,

consume a fifth of whisky every three
months or 100 cans of beer a year, it
will cost you $3.40 more than‘ last year.
THE GASOLINE TAX will jump
from 11/; cents a gallon to 3 cents.
So if the family uses 15 gallons a
week, that’s another $11.70‘ a ‘year. The
20 per cent cosmetic tax will be ex-
tended to shampoo, so if your wife
buys a 50-‘cent bottle every month, add
another $1.20.
~The present 7‘ per cent tax on auto
sales will be hiked to 20 per cent, which
means that when the_family buys a
used jalopy for $500, it will cost an
extra $65. If you only buy $10 worth
of phonograph records a year, it’ll
cost you an extra $1.50, because of a
tax jump to 25 per cent.
Let’s say‘ theifamily refrigerator is
breaking down. To buy a new one will
cost an extra $25 in taxes, because‘ of

the proposed 25 per cent tax on refrig-

erators.

Add it all up, and you get a proposed
increase‘in _taxes, even on very modest
purchases, of $154.20. That’s more than
two weeks’ wages.

Your income taxes will be only 6
per cent under‘ the level you paid at
At the
same time, prices have jumped at least
15 per cent since the end of the war.
This means that what’s left over, after
taxes have been paid, is worth far less
than what was left, after taxes, in
World War II.

Compare this with the proposals for
taxing the man with a $75,000 a year
income. His tax would go up from
$34,582 to $37,48_6——which would leave
it 21 per cent below the rate he paid
during World War II——or $10,200 less.

The Council of Economic ‘Advisers
reports that corporate profits after
1946,
$13.9,biIlion; 1947, $18.5 billion; 1948,
$20.9 billion; 1949, $17 billion; 1950,
$21.9 billion. _

Yet in his “equality of sacrifice”
tax. message, the President urged Con-
gress NOT to consider ‘a more effective
excess profits tax until later, even
though organized labor and others
have exposed the present excess prof-

It makes you wonder just what

Butte local

BUTTE, Mont.——Members of Minelss
Union No. 1 are. feeling mighty "proud
of themselves these days—and it isn't
only because they just carried 31° union
shop election by an overwhelming
margin.

Reason for their pride is that Damon
Lodge No. 1, Knights of Pythias, has
singled out their union to receive an
award as Butte’s outstanding organ-
ization of the year. To top it off, the
lodge awarded Russell Millward of the
Butte Miners Union No. 1 a citation
naming him as the outstanding lodge
member of 1950.

An engraved plaque was presented to

Ameal 1 president Joe Mason by R. E.

Schilling, supreme Pythias lodge rep-
resentative, at special ceremonies at
the Montana theatre. Schilling said,

‘ “When all the acts and deeds of the

_ Butte Miners Union were enumerated,
the committee had but one decision,
selection of the union. The miners
typify Butte. Their everyday labor

'1 ‘plus their altruistic woﬂc made-them

first choice, mumimom-ly.”

THE CITATION described the Union
“as the workers behind the scene in
the basic industry that is the backbone
and breath of life to the city in which
we live.”‘ ’

It _was emphasized that the award
was not so much for the year 1950 as
for the many years of service by the
local.

Millward, a grievance committeeman
at the Emma mine, has held every of-
fice in the subordinate lodge of the
Pythias and has served as a grand
lodge representative. He was a mem-
ber of the first Miners’ Union drum
and bugle corps.

It was believed that this is the first
time in which a national fraternal or-
ganization has so honored a labor un-
ion. It was recalled that the Butte
Miners Union had piled up a long
1._---d of public service over the years,
and that board member William Mason
once received a letter from Franklin D.
Roosevelt thanking him for the part
played by “Miner’s Voice” in re-e1ect-
_:_ing him. "

Clark and Mason hit Montana
Stienate for nixing Steinmetz

GREAT FALLS, Mont.-—Gov. John
Bonner responded quickly last week to
a Mine—Mill request that he demand re-
consideration by the Montana Senate
o.f its decision to reject the nomination

of Bruce I. Steinmetz as a member of
the Public Welfare Board.

Steinmetz, president of the Cascade
county trades and .labor assembly, was
rejected by the Senate because he
signed a petition against the Mundt-
Nixon bill last year. I

A telegram to Governor Bonney by
International president John Clark and
executive board member William Mason
expressed ‘(deep shock at this flagrant
attempt to smash Montana’s proud tra-
dition of freedom of opinion, freedom
of speech and protection for the right
to petition.”

The mesage pointed out that “Stein-
metz was joined by millions of other
decent, intelligent Americans in his
opposition to the Mundt-Nixon police
state _legislation.” And it added that
“some of the nation’s foremost citizens,
including Montana’s own Senator Mur-

_ nessmen and professional people.

ray, sharply attacked the Mundt-Nixon
thought-police proposa-ls.”

Clark and Mason asked: “Havv.e~ we
reached the point where a man. can
be barred from public office because
he fights for preservation of demo-
cratic American institutz'ons?”‘ Within
a few hours after they sent their
wire, Bonner sent a message to the
Senate at Helena asking for re—con-
sideration of. Steinmetz’ nomination.

Miami local wins
urhitml-on cases

MIAMI, Ariz.—Miami Miners Union
has won two out of three cases which
went to arbitration recently. The cases
won involved holiday pay while on va-
cation and motorm-an’s rate while haul-
ing development ore. .

The contract provides that if a holi-
day falls within an employee's vacation,
he shall be paid another day’s pay. The
Miami Copper Co. contended that since
Frank P. Frias, the employee involved,
did not work his last scheduled work
day before starting his vacation, he
therefore wasn’t entitled to this extra

' day’s pay.

The arbitrator ru ed that the con-
tract provision requiring an employee
to work the day before and the day
after the holiday did not apply in the
case of holidays falling within an em-
ployee’s vacation. Therefore, Frias will
receive the day’s pay, but- most im-
portant is the fact that in the future
employees will get the’ day’s pay if the
holiday falls within their vacation. ..

-The arbitrator ruled also that B. C.
Tellez and J. S. ‘P. Compos were en-
titled to ore train motor-man’s rate
while hauling development ore. The
Company, Miami ;Co.p,per, contended
they were not. Although the difference
is only 32¢ per day, it will affect a
sizable number of employees over a
long period of time.

Idaho locals win
two dispute cases

ML LLAN, Idaho—Two long-disputed
cases involving an ‘unfair discharge a
the Coeur d’Alene Mines and pro—rate
vacation pay at one ofthe Day prop;
erties have been won by Mine-Mill here.

In the vacation case at Day Mine
Inc., Idaho Pastore claimed pro-rategd
vacation as a -result of a layoff when
the Hercules mill was shut down in the

‘fall of 1949. The arbitrator, John

Gorsuch of Denver, ruled that tho
shutdown was a “plant delay in excess
of one week” and that Pastore was
therefore entitled to -his vacation pay
for the 151 shifts he had worked dur-
ing his qualifying year.

The other decision involved Eric A.
Osterberg, who was discharged from
the Coeur d’Alene Mines on April 14,
1950. Arbitrator Milton Green, law pro.
fessor from the University of Wash.
ington, asked the Company to reinstat
Osterberg to his job without loss 0
seniority.

Green also ruled that the Company
should pay Osterberg half back-pay
from April 14, 1-950, until he resumed
Work at the mines.

Both Locals 14 and 18 were involved
in the Osterberg case since the Coeur
d‘Alene Mines is under their dual jur-
isdiction. Local 14 fought through that
case of Pastore.

ii Sellout by steel

in ‘model’ plant
SPO-KANE, Wash.—The CIO Steel-

workers Union likes to ‘boast that it,

has a “model” union contract at the
nearby Trentwood aluminum plant of
Henry J. Kaiser.

The contract may be a good one, but
the Steel union officials don’t like to
do anything to make sure the workers
are protected under it.

Take the example of Forest Patten
a worker at Trentwood, who was fire
recently. The reason given on his dis-
charge slip was the kind of reason that
would make any decent union man
fighting mad: “lea-ding, aiding and
abetting in connection with the unau-
t/l0‘I'l:3€(l strike at the Trentwood
Works December 18, 1950.” -

The CIO Steelworkers Union has
made no move to get Patten’s job back
for him. -

Arizona miners protest
fax ~mc,rease proposals
MIAMI, Ariz.—A letter with over
three hundred names signed to it was
sent to Senator Earnest McFarland a
few daysago protesting the raising of
individual income taxes and the pas-
sage of any kind of national sales tax.

The letter pointed out‘ that the cor-
porations in this country are reaping
the highest profits in their history and
that if additional funds are needed,
they should come from these swolleri
profits and not from the individual
workers.

They also pointed out that they
would not stand by and‘let the govern-
ment or anybody else take away the
40-hour week. They said that they
worked too long and too hard to get
this to let it be taken away without 8
fight. _

Furthermore, they said. we are al-
ready working 48 hours and getting
overtime pay for the extra eight hours,
and that to take that away from us
would only amount to our doing the
same work for less money, which would
mean more money, to go into the; huge
profits of the com.p.an~i-es. ;’%I‘his alone
they claimed would amount to an aver-

age of $10 per week cut in take hom

: E ARE deeply interested in the announcement by the top
leaders of the CIO and AF L that they are withdrawing from all
posts in the government's war mobilizatoin program, and that they
are""boycotting" the Wage Stabilization Board.

 This step, which should have been made long ago, represents
 awakening to the‘ simple facts of life. R _

i ~  The position in which these so-called ,“lec’iders of labor" find]

' th"ems'elv_es is one of their own fashioning.

0 They were the -ones who accepted the idea of a wage freeze
well in advance.-’ That freeze is based "on the false and phony
V argument, never accepted‘ by Mine-Mill, that every wage increase

rnustybe followed. by a price increase. ' '

_ ' 0 They were the ones who failed to mobilize their rank-and-
 ﬁle around a ﬁghting campaign for a rollback of prices to levels
at existed before the Korean war. ‘

' 1 I -_They were the ones who actually consented to siton the
age Stabilization. Board asvfull-fledged meihbers, They did so
knowing that the Board was heavily loaded on the side of big
business, and knowing that ‘the Defense Production Act of 1950
made any genuine control of prices a complete impossibility.

I 0 They were the ones who for months have watched—with-
out any outcry—the staffing of every top job in the mobilization
program by, Big~Business spokesmen. 'They.now protest against
the operations" of a machine which they helped to build. “Having
swa1lowe_d‘a camel. they are straining at a gnat."

yd ‘£What makes’ them seem even more pathetic is that they are
. still trying.‘ to- make a "deal" around the issue of HOW FAR wages
can be raised under the freeze. They objectto 10 per cent, but
hint that they might be willing to accept 12 per cent, as if workers
can be bound by the_chain of any wageformula when prices and
’ profits remfain unbridled. '

We, of Mine-Mill, have made it clear,that we oppose wage
freeze, no" matter; what form it takes. We have made it clear that
there must beya rollback of prices to the levels at which they stood
before the Korean war began. We have made-it clear that we
intend to fight any kind of tax program which puts a greater
burden on the working man than he is already bearing.

' We have made it clear that we look upon the whole war‘
mobilization drive as a dangerous program to line the profiteers'
"pockets by . defrauding the workers and consumers. We -have
made it clear that we support the alternative road-—the path to
genuine peace.‘  - ' l - A‘ 

- . At the same time, however, ‘we are prepared to support and
join in any movement that is aimed at protecting thereal welfare
_of the people—and of the nation's wage earners. _If the leaders of
CIO_ and- AFL are sincerely interested in fighting against the
fraudulent price-wage ‘‘shell'’ game, our response is “let's go!"
If they intend only to maneuver for a few more fancy-titled jobs,
then they ‘are preparing one of the worst sell-outs in history.

A  We renew the call rnadeto our members» following the Inter-
"national Execuﬁve Board meetinglast month‘ to protest the phony
‘price freeze. the. vicious wage freeze. and the unbelievable pro-
‘ posals‘ for taxing" the working man “until it hurts."

unjust suspension and layoff cases. The
workers are determined to. win these
