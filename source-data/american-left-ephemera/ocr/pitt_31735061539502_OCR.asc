trial district a survey -revealed 1,320 items of unused
equipment valued at over a million rubles.

But the key element in the reform is the provision
that the measure of whether the plan of a. factory
is fulﬁlled is not only its output, and not only the
amount of the output sold, but what is commonly
called the “realization of production” — the amount
of production that has been sold, delivered and
PAID FOR. Only the completed transaction counts
in the calculating of whether the plan is fulﬁlled,
hence the basis for the bonuses. Consequently, the
sale and prompt payment by the buyer has become
the concern oat worker as well as management in
the plant.

Economic Reform Works A

THE PLANTS that have gone over to the eco-
nomic reform on an experimental basis since last
January are giving strong evidence of the correct-
ness of the policy and the productive potential that
the Soviet Union is only beginning to tap.

The reform, approved at :a meeting of the Cen-
tral Committee of the Communist Party in Sep-
tember, 1965, was applied cautiously. Last January
(1966) 43 plants were chosen for the try. By the
second quarter of the year another 200 plants
joined. By July, 1966, a total of 673 factories, em-
ploying about 10 percent of the Soviet Union’s
workers were under the new system according to
Lavrenti Podgrébnoy, head of the department of
wages and working conditions of the Central
Council of Trade Unions. I interviewed him at the
organization’s headquarters.

Everybody watched those initial experiments
with special interest ‘because, -according to the plan,
all Soviet -enterprises are to go over to the new sys-
tem within the next year to a year and a half.
There is much discussion in the Soviet press on the
ﬁrst experiences and especially on the results of
those initial 43 plants in terms of production, earn-
ings for workers, increased proﬁts, quality, reduc-
tion of spoilage, and such details.

PODIGREBNOIY, citing ﬁgures for the 243 plants
that were under the new system for at least six
months, observed they produced 302 million rubles
above the plan or 103 percent fulﬁlment. 
brought proﬁts above last year’s -by 40 million
rubles, 7.9 percent above the plan. Productivity rose
by 3.7 -percent. Proﬁt was actually 60 percent above
the year before. The workers’ monthly pay rose
four percent above a year ago and Podgreibnoy
ﬁgures that, at the rate going, the Workers will
average 10 days pay in bonus at the end of the
year.

In addition, those plants will have a substantial

10

increase in the “Factory Fund” - that part set
aside from proﬁts to improve the welfare of the
workers in terms of additional housing, child care,
medical and other health care, increased passes
for resorts (costing a maximum of seven rubles -
$7.70 for two weeks), additions to the union cul-
tural palaces, etc.

Characteristic of the plants under the re-
form, is their commitment to higher goals of pro‘-
duction, proﬁt and quality. The three-cfold incentive
— higher monthly earnings, year-end bonuses and

more for the welfare fund — are certainly an in-

ducement.

In the ca-se of the ﬁrst 43 plants, the enterprises
agreed to top the original plan for sale of goods
by 25 million rubles. But in the ﬁrst quarter they
surpassed the increased plan by another 25 million
rubles, topping the same period in 1965 by 8.4
percent. Some of the plants in that group raised
the sale of production by as much as 315 percent,
as in the case of Tlhe Moscow Watch Factory No. 2.

‘At A Clothing Plant

I FOUND especially interesting the interview
with Maria F. Kruznetsova, deputy director on eco-
nomic questions of Bolshevichka, the Moscow men’s
clothing complex of three plants employing 3,700
workers. It was the initial experimental plant and
Went over to the new system July 1, 1965, and
hence has a Whole year of experience to report.

In the past, Mlrs, Kuzneetsov-a told me, they turned
out clothing on direction from the ministry and had
to conform to 33 of the ministry’s guide-posts. The
result was that stores were often saddled with
much goods they couldn’t sell. Production in
quality and style was more the choice at the top
than at the point where people buy. Today, she
said, there are only six guideposts from -the minis-
try — like prices, proﬁt, the wage fund, capital
turnover. All other decisions are at the enterprise
level. Instead of quotas set at the top, Bols-hevichka
now has direct -contracts with the 18 stores the
plant supplies, and it works to their orders, in style,
sizes, color, etc. The plant orders textiles on the
basis of the indicated orders from these stores. To
guard against returns, much more emphasis is put
on the quality of Work.

THE KEY FIGURE, she said, is “realization of
production” —- sale, delivery and payment. Work-
ers are paid monthly bonuses on the basis of both
fulﬁlment of -the plan in production and quality,
and cut in the cost of production. If any of these
conditions is not met in a department, no bonus is
paid. This is designed to make every section of the
plant responsible. Production incentives run as high
as 40 percent above earnings. The engineering

11

  

staff's bonus based on the proﬁt level, can go as
high as 50 percent afbove earnlings. Based on the
ﬁrst eight months, proﬁts rose 40 percent; wages
rose an average of ﬁve rubles monthly, to -an aver-
age of 100 rubles the sto-res are more satisﬁed
because they are -coming closer to "what the people
want.

Mrs. Kuznetsova said the plant has found it
necessary to study public demand and raise its
commercial department to a much higher level of
importance than it held under the past system.

With Auto Workers

AS IN 1959, I had an opportunity to meet with
the leaders of the factory committee of the Lich-
achev auto plant in Moscow. After they gave me
a detailed review of therprogress the plant's 58,000
workers made in the past seven years, I questioned
them on the effect of the reform. The plant had then
been under the new system for only two -months.
Anatoli A. Andreyev, deputy chairman of the fac-
tory committee said the ﬁrst experience was en-
couraging. The rate of the improvement promises
the Workers an extra eight days’ pay at the end of
the year and a very substantial contribution to the
“factory fund” for housing and other welfare im-
provements. The workers, he said, would get dou-
ble that amount over a full year.

The union of this big truck plant is rich in
vacation resorts, sanatoriums, and children’s camps
in many «parts of -the USSR. It has a palace of cul-
ture staffed by 200 with a capacity of varied ac-
tivities for 10,000 of the plant’s members and their
families in any one day or evening. It operates on
a -budget of 800,000 rubles annually. But they are
planning to expand and renovate the palace next
year. They count on substantial expansion in these
ﬁelds and on more housing and health facilities and
means of recreation out of the share of the higher
proﬁts that goes into the factory fund.

With -the ﬁve-year plan calling for 686,000 “Zil”
trucks, the Lichachev workers set themselves ' a
higher goal as they -came under the reform. More
trucks means more earnings as well as stronger
Socialism. One of the veterans of the plant gave
me a rundown of some of the ways t-he “proﬁt
consciousness” is showing itself. One way, he said,
“is we no longer use a cannon to kill a swallow.”
By that he explained, he meant that there is no
longer -the practi-ce of ordering Ibig expensive ma-
chines for minor functions that could be taken
care of otherwise.

IN KIEV, Evgenin Yefremenko, secretary of the
Ukrainian Oouneil of Trade Unions, gave me a
similar picture on results at the Kharkov turbine
plant, Reading from a report he had just received,

12

 

 

he noted the turbine plant showed 12.7 percent
increase over the production plan; a proﬁt 7.4 per-
cent higher than plan; 170,000 more rubles than
planned for the bonus fund, a four ‘percent rise in

wages and 544,000 rubles for the socio-cultural‘

factory fund of which 330,000 is to go for new
housing construction.

The ﬁrst results of the agricultural reforms are
still to be assessed. They must be tested over a
longer period. The 1966 harvest was almost all in
when I left the Soviet Union.

The ﬁgures showed a new all-time high. Weather
was more cooperative this year. But the new meas-
ures were undoubtedly also a big factor. And the
ﬁgures for 1966 industrial output showed an in-

crease of 8.4 percent over a year ago compared
' with the -planned 6.7 -percent rise for the ﬁrst year

of the ﬁve-year plan. The incentives of the reform,

however, were not yet a signiﬁcant inﬂuence in-

thatpﬁgure. But the potential reserve in those re-
forms is clearly tremendous.

Bigger Role For Unions

MY INTERVIEWS with leaders of factory com-
mittees, and discussions for several days with heads
of departments of the All-Union Central Council
of Trade Unions [brought out much on the bigger
role of the trade unions under the economic re-
forms now being applied.

The role and strength of Soviet trade unions has
been steadily rising in recent years 5both_ as an
active force for socialist progress and as a pro-
tector of the rights of the country’s work force
which is now nearing 80 million. Ninety-ﬁve per-
cent of the workers are in the unions. The gigantic
force the unions have become in the USSR is seen
in ﬁgures showing the trend through the seven-
year plan.

Union membership, in the 25 -national unions,
totaled 51,780,000 in 1958. It is nearing 75 million
today. There is no checkoff in the USSR and mem-
bership is strictly voluntary, with dues for most,
paid individually, the maximum of one percent
of wages.

The organization machinery follows the line of
the USSR’s «geographical division and republics.
There are 478,000 factory committees for each of
the enterprises or work locations, elected by the
workers, the primary local unit-s.

THE SIZE of the factory committee, depending
on the size-of the plant, may represent a small es-
talblishment or one with 920,000 workers, as at the
Gorky auto plant. Fabcom, the factory cornmi-ttee,
names all its sub-commissions for its m-any ﬁelds
of work. The workers in each department elect a
department committee. Each work team names a

13

 

  

“union group,” usually of four persons, to handle
its affairs. In 1964 there were 1,593,000 such groups
in the USSR. Elections are secret from the lowest
unit to the membership meeting or plant conven-
tion that annually elects the fabcom.

Ninety-six percent of the factory committees
function without full-timers. Ninety—four percent
of the regional and city committees of the union
and almost all department committees, have no
full-timers. Those with elected post in the plant or-
ganizations of the unions numbered 4,073,000 in
the 1963-64 elections. Of th-at number, 2,182,000
were women. With all those nam-ed to the numerous
committees under each fabcom, the -total number of
activists at the enterprise level came to 23 million
in 1964.

-Counting other activists in the vast network of
organizations under union operation, the census
of activists in 1964 came to 28,401,000. No move-
ment in history has ever achieved such a high
degree of rank -and ﬁle voluntary involvement in
an organization. i

What makes those ﬁgures especially signiﬁcan
is the regular frequent checkup iby fatbcom and
its subdivisions on the performance of their actives.
So direct and speciﬁc is the responsibility for each
commission or factory group, that none can escape
an accounting of stewardship. The scope of the
factory committee’s work can be seen -from the
list of its permanent commissions. Among them
are commissions on wages and work rules, safety
of labor, social insurance, pensions, housing and
community welfare, control of community retail
trade and public feeding, work among women, on
problems of youth employed in the factory, and a
commission on children.

The Real Inﬂuence

THE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT of a Soviet
factory covers far more ground than the pacts of
enterprises in capitalist land-s. On the other hand,
there are some provisions in agreements of capi-
talist lands that are not needed in the USSR.

Vacations, for example, are provided for all
workers «by law, with a minimum of two weeks,
and as many as six weeks for -certain industries.
The collective contract is only concerned with
ways to provide the best possible recreation and
health centers where a maximum of the workers
can spend their vacations at very low cost.

This is also true for sick beneﬁts, kindergardens
for children of working mothers, free medical care,
training of youth, time off for women before and
after child birth, and many other such basic rights
provided in the U‘.S‘SR’s constitution. The collective

14

 

  

 

agreement is mainly concerned wth effective im-
plememtation of those rights at the factory and com-
munity level and preventing their violation.

IN THE USSR, as in all socialist lands, the work-
ers actually have three main channels for achiev-

'ment of socio-economic «progress, both in terms of

direct wages in their pay envelope and the steadily

_ rising and su"bst~antia1 «part of their basic needs

that come in the form of free public services. So-
viet workers receive medicare, higher education,
almost-free rent, childcare, vacation resorts, cul-
tural and recre-ational needs. Taxes are very low.

The workers are the -major force in the govern-
ment and in the planning of the country’s economic
course. Thu-s they are in a position to ‘have a ‘big
say from the initial planning stage of the economy.
They have a voice in the setting of ‘perspectives on
Wages in the course of a ﬁve-year plan, on price
and tax policy (including taxes on wages), pen-
sion and social insurance payments and on the
other socio-economic issues. When tens of thousands
of meetings, mostly at factories, with tens of mil-
lions participating, take place in discussion prior
to the legal enactment of a .ﬁve—year plan, it is
in eﬂ:'ect, what amounts to a discussion of a “col-
lective contract” on which the life of the plant and
its factory committee will be based for the next

ﬁve years. The five-year plan for 1966-70 provides,
for example, that the REAL living standard of the
workers must rise 30 percent during its life time.

THE WORKERS are the major inﬂuence in the
legislative organs of the USSR from the local Soviet
(council) to the highest bodies. No laws are ever
passed, if they have a relation to working con-
ditions or living standards, on housing and such
questions, without consultation and agreement with
representatives of unions.

The trade unions, and espcially their «gigantic
network of nea-rly a half million factory committees,
and their collective agreements and activity, are,
along with the respective Communist Party units,
the basic instruments for applying the laws and
plans in life. In fact the rule is that on all key
questions at an enterprise, the “trio” -— the Party
branch, the factory committee and the management
— must agree.

Collective Agreements

THE 104,000 collective agreements in the Soviet
Union covering 77,000,000 workers are actually an
annual program for the goals and activities to
which the union and management of an enterprise
are committed.

A collective agreement is of great importance.
Many weeks are taken in negotiations, and in con
sideration of the many proposals that come from
the workers. Not until the document is ﬁnally
examined at meetings, from the smallest work-
team unit to the factory-Wide membership meeting
or convention, and given approval, does it take
effect.

This is more than a factory problem; it covers
the aifairs of the entire comunity of the workers
of the plant.

Each of the departments of the Central Council I

of Trade Unions has a section in the agreement. In

fact, in the week I interviewed the department ,

heads, “Soviet Unions,” the magazine of the Cen-
tral Council, ran an editorial on the reform in
which there was already reference to violation in
certain plants of the provisions in the reform for
substantial wage incentives. Factory committees
were directed to be vigilant against managements.-
who make a mockery of the incentives and thus
undermine the key element in the reform for‘rais-
ing production.

I DISCUSSED the problem with Lavrenti Pod-
grebnoy, who heads the Department on Wages and.
Working Conditions. He explained that the program.
of correcting and revising the occupational grades
of workers carried out during the seven-year plan.
brought the number of grades in Soviet industry‘

16

 

 

as a whole down to six- from the eight in the past.
In the process, the yearly wage was increased by
eight billion -rubles, most of it for the lowergrades.
The wage -grade into which a worker’s class-
iﬁcation ﬁts sets the base for his earnings. But his
increasing interest is in the possibilities of earning
above the monthly base scale through higher pro-
duction and the incentive bonuses through the
reform.

Podgrebnoy said that new technology has re-
duced the number of pieceworkers in the USSR from
70 to 56 percent. But workers not on piece rates,
who depend on their work classiﬁcation, also gain
bonuses on the -basis of the performance of the
entire enterprise. Thus all the -workers are interested
in achieving the hi-ghest productivity and proﬁt-
ability.

THE SOVIET LABOR force is rising steadily
ﬁrom 56 million to 77 million in seven years and
the new technology requires a steadily rising num-
ber of skilled, ed-ucated specialized workers. Many
millions of workers are being trained in technical
schools for higher occupational grades. In fact, a
part of every collective agreement covers the ob-
ligation of management to provide the means of‘.
lifting the educational level of workers who didn’t:
get secondary education and training for new skills
and for engineering technical professions.

A high percentage of the workers ﬁnd upgrading
through training and education the major way
to get higher earnings. Most larger plants have their
own. training centers for technicians and skilled
trades.

Safety and Health

NADIEZHDA KANN-UNOVA, deputy head of the
Safety Department, told me there are now more
than 2,500,000 factory inspectors and members of
safety committees. More than 3,000 inspectors have
the right to shut down any 1-ine o-r department, if
conditions are -unsafe, until corrected. The govern-
ment invests four billion rubles annually for safe-
guards in all forms. She described how in at least
three cases, directors of railroad divisions were
removed, because they resisted correction of unsafe
working conditions.

Miss Kanunova also told how problems of auto-
mation and other new technology are met in the
USSR. Dieselization eliminated ﬁremen on the rail-
roads just as in the U.S. But from the outset of the
change, the workers due for elimination were put
on nine-month courses and trained as engineers’
helpers (a requirement for all train locomotives
111 the  or other jobs, without being taken off
work and -with full pay. This approach shows why;

Soviet workers are not afraid of automation or
greater eﬁiciency in any form.

About two billion is spent on milk, butter and
special foods for workers -whose work involves a
health hazard. Moreover, she explained, workers
who show signs of health deterioration, are as-
signed, usually for a month, to a prophylactorium,
where they are taken daily from their work to
‘receive medical attention, proper diet and over-
:night stay. They get longer assignments if needed.
"It is also the task of the safety division to observe
«compliance with the legal ban on all types of
unsafe work for women or youths and protection
for pregnant women. Injured workers continue to
get full wages as long as they are incapacitated.

The trade unions control, through an apparatus
totaling 2,500,000 activists, the vast social insur-
ance system of the USSR. Committees and dele-
gates at the enterprise level handle many types
of beneﬁts and pensions under the insurance sys-
tem. They also pass on applications for sana-
toriums and vacation resorts operated by the
unions.

An average of 7,000,000 workers are accommo-
dated annually in the 4,000 resorts and health

centers.

IVAN KOZLOV, head of the department of Health
and Vacation Resorts of the unions, said the fast-
growing capacity of the establishments is still far
short of demand. Plans call for building resorts
in cold Siberian areas, as well as in the vast sub-
tropical areas of the country. Also under his de-
partment are the chil-dren’s camps of the unions
which annually accommodate about 5,000,000.

Kozlov explained that the regular price per
person for two weeks to a month runs from 30
to 40 rubles ($33 to $44). But only the top salaried
workers in the technical professions pay the full
price. Ten percent of the -passes are given free to
workers who are unable to pay, but are deemed
deserving by decision of the factory committee. The
remainder of the passes are given to workers at 30
percent of the cost.

The unions operate 20 special sanatoriums for
youths 15-17 years old with health difﬁ-culties at
no charge at all. Kozlov indicated big expectations
for expansion of the vacation and health resorts
under the economic reform, because the prospects
for bigger allotments from growing proﬁts are in
the ofﬁng. The outlook of the unions is for no charge
at all for vacation passes.

LOOKING most hopefully to prospects under the
reform is the housing and social-welfare depart-
ment whose chief is Mrs. Nefeodova. “We cover
every question after work” she said. That includes
the division of new housing and all communal

18

' _r

services——retailing, transportation, -public feeding,
recreation, maintenance of apartment buildings,
childcare etc. Her department looks to bigger facto-
ry funds so more funds will go for those purposes.
The commissions -concerned, numbering more than
two million members, have the task of recommend-
ing who should be next in line for new housing
as it -becomes available to the plant “collective.”

We can only touch on the activities of the USISR’s
unions within the scope of these articles. The unions
operate more than 19,000 houses and palaces of
culture. Many of them are immense institutions
with staﬁs of 100 to 200 teachers in the arts and
various hobbies, and able to accommodate -as many
as 10,000 men, women and children a day. Some
have budgets of as much as a million rubles a year.
They are the centers of recreation, education and
social life for the communities.

The unions have more than 500 theatres at which
professional as well as amateur performances are
given. More than 34,000 libraries with some 205
million books and 22 million readers are operated
by unions.

More than 24,000 ﬁlm projectors are operated
with the total attending at union shows more than
600 million in 1964. Small establishments or de-
partments have an additional 175,000 “red corners,”
smaller scale cultural places convenient at lunch-
time.

There is the gigantic sports movement under
union directions with more than 78,000 physical
culture units with a membership of more than 18
million.

International Ties Widen

BORIS A. AVERYANOV, head of the Intema-
tional Aﬂairs Department of the Soviet trade
unions, was in the midst of a very busy sched»
ule when I interviewed him in his office. Only a
day before he saw off homeward -the -delegation of
the Trade Union Congress of Britain with which
he was occupied -for about two weeks.

“This is a very {big year for us,” he said, noting
the lange number of delegations from aﬂiliates of
the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions that visited the USSR. Last June, he said,
his department was host to a delegation of the
Christian Unions of France that was pleased with
the reception and invited -a Soviet -trade -union del-
egation for a return visit. Friendly contacts were
also established with Socialist-led trade unions in
Italy. Also a delegation from the trade -unions of
Ireland paid a visit. The New Zealand Federation
of Labor and Australian unions, were others of the
ICFTU aﬂiliates that showed a similar attitude out
friendship and interest in the Soviet Union.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

This pamphlet is an eyewitness account of a re-
cent two-month visit to the Soviet Union during
which the author toured cities, factories, social
institutions and interviewed leading personnel and
rank and ﬁle workers on the new developments in
that socialist country. George Morris, who was
for 32 years Labor Editor of the Daily Worker and
The Worker, has visited the Soviet Union a number
of times, including the ﬁrst year of the first Five
Year plan, in 1929, and the start of the seven-year
plan in 1959. He has written many pamphlets on
trade union affairs and a book American labor:
Which Way? This pamphlet is a slight abridgement
of a series of articles that appeared in’The Worker.

“And we had a delegation of the Belgian labor
movement, right from Brussels, where the ICJFTU
has its headquarters,” continued Averyanov‘ with
a chuckle. “And they had no reaction from George
Meany, I was told.”

SIGNIFICANT was disclosure by Arveryanov that
a delegation of West Germany’s la.‘bor federation was
preparing to visit the USSR as guest of the All-
Union Council of Trade Unions. West Germany’s
unions have been counted in Meany’s circle as its
closest political friends in Europe and as a back-
bone of conservatism.

Averyanov expressed satisfaction with the trend.
He did not regard the many visiting delegation of
IOFTU unions as necessarily an expression of po-
litical friendship to the Soviet Unions and its
unions. Burt it marked a change of attitude. ’He
ventured the opinion that much of it expressed a
spirit of independence against the efforts of George
Meany’s group to dominate the ICFTU. He noted
that in his travels in Western Europe as a fra-
ternal delegate to the British and other labor con-
ventions, he ran into much hostility towards Meany

4 from labor leaders in Britain and the Scandinavian

countries. Meany wrote ICFTU unions in 1965,
the Confederation was formed 16 years ago as an
instrument against “Communism” and that remains
its main function. The AFL-C10 sunk many mil-
lions of dollars into the ICFTU to dominate and
maintain it as an anti-Commrunist instrument. But
while Meany hasn’t changed in 16 years, the world
has, and most labor leaders of Western Europe who
in earlier cold war days danced to Meany’s tune,
find that they can’t run a labor movement on anti-
oommunism. Many are resentful of Meany’s rabid
pro-swar position and McCarthy-like anti-Soviet-
ism. It emlbarrasses them in the eyes of their own
members.

I ASKED AVERDIANOV about the prospects for

exchange visits with U.S. unions. He conﬁrmed a a

new invitation to Soviet trade unions from the
United Auto Workers and said a delegation would
come. But he also recalled the sad experience
with the State Department when, on intrusion of
Meany’s ofﬁce, visas ‘were denied last summer a
few days before a delegation responding to an
earlier invitation, was scheduled to depart for the
United States.

The problem, of course, is one for the UAW and
other U.S. unions who may object -to State Depart-
ment and Meany’s dictation to them on whom they
can or cannot invite. But Averyanov expressed
the hope that American union representatives
would visit the USSR and promised a welcome to
any that come and cooperation with them so they
can see what they desire.

.In terms of some thawing of the cold war that
divided world labor, the visit of the British dele-
gation to th-e Soviet Union was undoubtedly a
major development. It was a top—level delegation
of the Trade Union Congress. The British dele-
gation also met with Soviet trade union leaders in
a conference chaired by Victor Grishin, the head
of the All-Union Oouncil of Trade Unions, at which
the mutual desire for continued friendship and
contacts was voiced. An invitation to the Soviet
unions for a return visit was -also indicated.

It should be noted that no visiting delegation
complained about the arrangements. The Soviet
hosts arranged‘ for anything that was wanted, made
it possible to see what they wished and to go
wherever they wanted. Most of the delegations
were astounded by what they saw when shown
the vast scope of the work of the Soviet trade
unions, the cultural palaces, sport arenas, resorts,
educational institutions and health facilities under
union operation. In capitalist lands unions oouldn’t
‘dream of s-u-ch things. No less interesting to the
delegations were the work rules enforced by the
unions with an authority few unions in carpuitalist
lands can command. Much misincfoxmation w-as
cleared up.

Before my departure, Averyanov expressed the

— hope that the ‘bars may be down in U.S. unions

before long. For -a half century the labor leader-
ship, ﬁrst under the -presidency of Samuel Gom-
pers, then under William Green and now Mieany,
has forbidden American unions to even take a 1-ook
in the socialist lands.

Socialism and Crime

THE SOVIET UNION is giving strong conﬁrma-
tion to the long-standing. position of Marxists that
the path to ultimate elimination of crime is
through Socialism. The experience of East Euro-
pean socialist countries is similar. Most signiﬁcant
is the downward trend of crime and of “hooligan”
type disorderly conduct among -the youth -- a trend
directly opposite to that of the U.S. and other
major capitalist countries.

This problem interested me during the 1966 visit
as it did in 1959 when I wrote of my interviews
with Soviet law enforcement oﬁicials who then, as
today, put more stress on the task ahead than on
success achieved.

When I left the U.S., crime was building up as an
issue in the N. Y. elections and in some other
parts of the country. What interested me is whether
there was evidence in the Soviet Union of the grow-
ing degeneration trend that marked -cap=ita1i~st areas
like the U.S. and England.

I therefore arranged for an interview at the
Institute for the Study of Causes of Crime. To my

pleasant surprise, I was met by ﬁve of the leading
authorities of the Institute, and we had a seminar
for several hours.

’MY MAIN interest was in the youth. I found that
the Institute people were well informed of the ap-
palling crime rate in -the U.S. and were following
developments. But while noting the steady and
substantial improvement in the ﬁght on la~wbreak-
ing in the USSR, they did not take a boastful tone
but frankly pointed to the problems and the job
ahead in their own country. They noted, for ex-
ample that the study of criminology had been long
neglected and only recently had been made a subject
for social studies in Soviet schools. The first
textbook, .a copy of which they presented me, had
just come off the press.

Boris S. Nikiforov, who speaks ﬂuent English,
gave a general rundown of the problem on behalf
of the group. He stressed that the attitude toward
law violators, the position of the courts and pun-
ishment and reform are very different from the sit-
uation in the U.S. or other capitalist countries.

If the -cause of law violation is social—like bad
family conditions, lack of education and the like,
“then it is not considered criminal,” said Nikiforov.
Strictly speaking, he added, the USSR does not have
imprisonment in our sense.

He described the four categories of work colon-
ies to which lawvrbreakers are conﬁned for periods,
depending on the gravity of their crime. The ap-
proach is how to restore persons to the status of
useful citizens.

No Crime Syndicates

“WE HAVE HAD a steady decrease of crime for
a long time,” Nikiforov went on. “But we are not
satisﬁed with the rate of elimination of certain of
the graver crimes. Scientiﬁcally speaking, we do
not have organized crime at all. We have practic-
ally none of the major crimes you have in the U.S.
-- no narcotics traﬁic or addiction, no widespread
rape, professional prostitution, bank robberies and
such.”

He explained that such stealing as they have,
like embezzelement of state property or of personal
property, is on mostly what we would call a “petty”
scale. But in the USSR they consider such acts
seriously.

“Hooliganism is our ‘big problem,” continued Niki-
forov. “Thirty to forty percent of the law violations
are in that category. And 96 percent of all the hooli-
gan acts start with drunkenness. The problem in our
country is not so much crime as drunkenness. If
that were solved, the crime problem would be
solved almost automatically.”

He cited statistics showing that trials for law

212

 

 

violations dropped 24.5 percent last year below
1962 and by 42.7 percent below 1958; were a fourth
of the number in 1946 (a bad year immediately
after the war), and are currently running at half
the pre-war number, when the population and the
number of teen-age youths were considerably lower.

While what they call hooliganism is still the
major problem, the number tried on such charges
last year was 41.5 percent lower than in 1962 and
“intention to kill” cases were 96.9 percent below
1962.

WHAT IS MEANT by hooliganism? Nikiforov
said it was mainly hell-raising in the streets, dis-
turbing neighborhoods in late hour-s, hurling in-
sults at people, particularly at women.

“And you list such conduct as crime?” I said.
“In our country this is usually ignored.”

He came ba-ck with the answer I ‘got in 19:59 from
the chief prosecutor of the Russian Soviet Repub-
lic, that in the -past such conduct was also ignored,
but now the Soviet Union is at a higher level in
preserving public order. Even cursing in public is
termed a violation of public order.

I noted in the textbook and other literature on
crime prevention that enforcement of respect for
public order and people is regarded as part of
the -process of educating the people for the higher
social stage — Communism.

Causes Not Economic

TO MY INQUIRY on the causes of disrespect for
people and law violation among the youth, Niki-
forov turned to Madame Melnikova, who specializes
on the problems of youth. -She emphasized, as Niki-
forov did earlier, that few crimes in the Soviet
Union have their cause in economic conditions.
The USSR’s data shows, she said, that 72 percent
of the youths who commit crimes come from homes
regarded as of good economic conditions.

“The major cause is had family upbringing. They
usually come from unsuccessful families, divorced
parents, or parents who drink, or where there is
no father. This is especially bad for boys who aim
to go away, or take to hanging around streets. The
Soviet Union's studies on youth problems,” she said,
“conﬁrm everywhere that the major way to meet
youth delinquency is better home surroundings,
more emphasis on education, more involvement of
Wuth in sport or other activities. Every Soviet
(council) in Soviet cities and other geographical
subdivisions has a youth commission with repre-
sentatives of all interested public bodies, con-
cerned with pneventing and comblating youth
delinquency. '

Only in rare cases of delinquency are youths put
behind bars. All punishment is designed to also be

23

 

 

   

corrective. I was shown considerable data at the
Institute proving that where coordinated efforts
are made involving all elements of a youth pro-
gram, the prevention of law-breaking has been
most satisfactory. Among the exemplary records is
Leningrad’s for 1960-64. This was the period when
the big post-war cro-p of babies reached" the ages
of 14 to 18. But instead of a rise in lawbreaking in
this greatly increased group, there was a 37 percent
drop.

THE TEXT on criminology I received at the In-
stitute summarized the trend as follows:

1) ‘Crimes against the government, such as may
be inspired from hostile sources abroad, are now
insigniﬁcant.

2) There is a general decline in all crime.

3) Of the law ‘violations that .are committed, a
steadily increasing percentage of them are in the
less severe category.

4) There is a steady success in wiping out the
graver crimes and there is a decline in the rate of
crime repeaters.

5) There is virtual elimination of organized seri-
ous crime.

That text gives an analagous picture in the east
European states. Data are given of a similar exper-
ience in eliminating law—breaking among youths in
Poland, Czechoslovakia and the German Demo-
cratic Republic. Especially interesting is the com-
parison given between the two Germanys, showing
crime among youth rising in West -Germany.

MY PERSONAL experience in two summer
months in the Soviet Union more than c-onﬁr-med
the data and interviews at the Institute. I often
took late walks alone and returned to my hotel
as late as «midnight. I saw an occasional drunk, but
no sign of street disorder, no Boweries or similar
quarters, no beggars, no streetwalkers.

In Kiev I took a walk 11 p.m. in the city’s big
park, something I wouldn’t do in Central Park at
that hour.

The major reason why they are so successful in
reducing youth delinquency and crime is that the
socialist system provides all the means for doing
so from the child-care.stage to the time a youth
rea-ches manhood. Centers at work locations or
communities, at a trivial cost, care for millions of
children up to the school stage. Pioneer centers and
children’s activities at cultural clubs involve mil-
lions in afterschool activities.

The facilities for involvement of teen-agers and
older youths in sport and other activities are on a
scale that no capitalist country could even dream of.

But basically most important is that in the Soviet
Union higher education is available to all at no
cost, and there is no such thing as involuntary idle-

24

 

 

ness for a. young person. There is no economic
cause there for delinquency.

With The Youth League

AN AFTERNOON with the leadership of the
Pervomaysky region of the Moscow Kornsomol was
a treat and an education on the tremendous dy-
namic role of the 2:2-million member C'ommunist
Youth League in the Soviet Union. Nowhere in the

‘world does any youth organization, Communist or

otherwise, embrace so high a percentage of the

youth -as does the Komsomol in the USSR. And .

nowhere is the youth so well organized and in-
volved in activity.

About a dozen of the key leaders received me
at the very modest regional headquarters. They
ranged in age from about 2-0 to the mid—twenties.
During most of our meeting they answered my
questions. But they also shot some questions at
me, indicating they followed events closely in the
U.S. Everyone of the young men and women seem-
ed alert and sharp as a whip. Within this limited
space I can only give the highlights.

EVGENIE S. ABERIN, second secretary of the
region, gave a fast rundown of the scope and ac-
tivity of the Pervomaysky Komsomal — the largest
in the Soviet Union, with 70,000 members. This is
within an area of 500,000 population of which 100,-
000 are youth. The 444 Komosol units range in
membership from ﬁve to 1.1,000——the latter “little
branch” at the Technical School.

The largest factory unit is at the Kuybishev
Electrical Manufacturing Plant, where the Kom-
somol has 2,000 members. Pervomaysky is one of
the highly industrialized regions of Moscow.

Aiberin asserted from the outset, “Our basic
problem is to bring up our youth in the spirit of
our fathers and for Communism.” That theme, he
said, will stand out in the Komsomo1’s program for
the observance of -the 50th Year of the Soviet Union.

The drive is intense to keep alive a high respect
for the forefathers and older generation and an
appreciation of what they fought and died for.

Those who were children in the time of the
Revolution are grandparents today. The youth of
today did not ﬁght in World War II. Life is much
easier for the youth of the USISYR today than ever
before. In fact, the heavy toll in the war against
fascism has made children and youth even more
the No. 1 concern in the USSR than ever before.
As everywhere in the world, young people tend to
take the recent advances for granted -— as some-
thing that always was and will be.

A number of new ﬁlms I saw in the USSR are
a revival of documentaries of war and the horrible
experiences of the -people in Nazi-occupied areas.

25

 

 

  
  

The theme is not to forget, not to relax on defense
readiness, and to bring up everyone in the spirit
of labor —- as a useful member of society. An idler
is at the lowest social level in the USSR today.

Pride in Work

ABERIN WENT into detail on the way the Kom-
somol carries out its program — for the youth now
at work on ways to become most eﬂlcient and to
strive to reach higher levels of skill and technologi-
cal knowledge; for those still in school, to under-
stand the kind of a world they may expect ﬁve
years hence when they are at work.

“We educate our youth to have pride in their
profession, no matter what they do,” he said.

One task occupying Komsomols everywhere to-
day is “ﬁnding our’ heroes,” said Aberin. “Every
region is involved in research into records, and in
every other way to learn about the heroes of the
war from our area, to tell the story of what they
did and do something that will keep the memory of
them alive.”

One form is to plant a tree for each of -the heroes
and mark them with plaques.

This year, 1,200 of the members of the Institute
unit spent the summer by taking assignments to far
off places in the north or the hot south and the
Virgin lands —as aides in various tasks in political
wonk, libraries and collective farms and other
communities.

ONE OF THE‘ STUDENTS -present, a pride of the
region, was the leader in the formation of a cir-
cle of some 150 who prepare themselves to lecture
on various subjects, including international
affairs. The reporter and several others in the
group have each passed the 30-0-mark in lectures to
youth groups and organizations of adults. They
travel widely on lecture tours, covering collective
farm groups and other communities where their
educational value is highly appreciated.

Vitali Dunayevsky, of the electrical plant, who
heads the Komsomol’s industrial work in the re-
gion, described the big role of the youth organiza-
tion in the production drive.

The Komsomol’s “Projector” campaign is di-
rected at uncovering bad spots: waste, unused ma-
terial, neglect, and other such ways. With some
1,800 in the plant fresh from school, the Komsomol
strives to make work and life at the plant attractive
to the newcomers, and draws them into social,
sport and political activity. Birthdays, marriages
and “first pay” days are marked by ceremonies.

I asked Dunayevsky about the attitude of the
skilled workers to the youth. He said it is very
cooperative.

The standard practice in the USSR is to “tie”

26

 

 

an apprentice to a veteran mechanic who teaches
him and watches over his progress. Craftsmen in
the Soviet Union have no fear of learners, as is
often the case in the US. In 1966, because of a
change in the school system, twice as many as
usual were graduated and made available to the
manpower pool. A special order to all plants to add
a minimum of six percent of their employes from
the ranks of the youth, more than took care of
that problem.

OUR DISCUSSION livened up considerably when
I «posed some questions on what the Soviet people
call “hooliganism.” Aberin said there are some
elements in that category in the region that the
Komsomol must deal with when they come into
plants. Usually the plant’s Komsomol arranges to-
have one of its seasoned people placed next to
such persons at work with the objective of be-

friending and reforming the youth through attrac-

tion to various activities.

One of the young women in charge of work
among students in lower grades referred to the
problem of youth as not “hooligans” '-but as “peda-
gogically neglected” kids. She told of her experience
with such youths during specially arranged part
work and play summer camps for such groups, to
prove that they change with a proper approach.

Aberin said the menace of hooliganism is often
exaggerated. They reported that at the technical in-
stitute where from 14,000 to 20,000 attend in six
years there were only two cases of stealing.

I noted that, the day before, the experts of the
Institute on the Study of Causes of Crime, told me
the problem of youth delinquency is not crime but
mainly bad upbringing in the home, with drunken-
ness the source. The group responded aﬂirmatively
in a chorus, and a number gave examples to il-
lustrate.

We could have gone on and on, but the supper
hour was upon us. “Too bad we didn’t arrange to
start in the morning. We’d -have all day,” observed
Alberin.

It is in such discussions with youth active at the
grassroots that you really gain a full appreciation of
the great remoulding of people that is taking place
in Socialist lands.

TOWARD the end, they turned on me with ques-
tions. It need hardly be said that question No. 1 is
the attitude of Americans to the dirty war in Viet-
nam, and they wanted to know of the peace move-
ment.

As frequently in my discussions with people in
the USSR, on this occasion, too, concern was over
the threat of another war and the Vietnam situa-
tion. How far will the escalation go? Is there pop-
ular support for the Johnson war line? And back
of such questions was the desire to know whether

the jingoism and lunacy that swept Nazi Germany
is evident in America. I did my best to convince
them that the peace movement in America is un-
precedented in scope and the attitude of the people
is indicated by the polls showing decline of John-
son’s popularity. (This was before the election.)
They listened very attentively. Many Soviet youths
grew up orphaned by World War II. They saw
how the war’s destruction set back socialist prog-
ress. They want very much a continuance of the
current fast pa-ce forward on all economic, social
and cultural fronts. But every-body in the USSR is
convinced that success for the U.S hawks in South-
east Asia would be a prelude to a world war. That’s
why you hear so many people, especially the young,
voice a readiness to volunteer for service in Viet-
nam if called upon to do so.

Looking Ahead

ROUNDING OUT its ﬁrst half century, the
Soviet Union demonstrated that socialism has a
vitality th-at surpasses the dreams of the early
Marxists. Its great economic development, scien-
tiﬁc know-how, and vast resources provide a
gigantic base for both the progress of its own peo-
ple and aid to peoples everywhere ﬁghting im-
perialism and moving towards socialism.

You didn’t have to be many days in the Soviet
Union to sense in its people a feeling of this great
strength. I saw it in 1929 d-uring mobilization for
the ﬁrst year of the ﬁrst ﬁve—year plan, and in
1959 when they began on the ﬁrst year of the
seven-year plan. But this ti-me the enthusiasm
is heightened by the fact that the country has
entered a stage when the people can partake far
more substantially of the fruits of their economic

sixth of the world.”

progress. The emphasis, as we already noted, is
much stronger on both the quantity and quality
of consumer goods and on raising the purchasing
power of the people.

Overall industrial production was 62 percent of
the U.S. level in 1965, but in 1950 it was only 31
percent of U.S. production that year.

WHEN GIVEN a chance to compete peacefully
with capitalism, the Soviet Union showed a rate of
economic progress the world has never seen be-
fore. The first ﬁve-year plan began in 1929 when
the Soviet Union reached (after 11 years) restora-
tion of the economy shattered by the ' ﬁrst World
War and the civil war, to approximately the level

- of 1913, the last peace year under the tsar. The

production of the Soviet Union is now 60 times
that level.

. Because last year the Soviet government insti-

' tuted production reforms designed to accellerate

the rise in production and give workers greater
earnings incentives, critics of the Soviet Union
everywhere raised a howl that things are going
badly; that the reforms are just a scheme to meet
a “crisis.” The truth is that the reforms and the
plan calling for more consumer products and
higher earnings are possible because the USSR has
reached a stronger economic base. At earlier stages,
incentives for higher earnings would have been
almost meaningless because the possibility of
spending them was limited.

The Social Yardstick

BUT IS PRODUCTION data the only measure
for comparison of socialism and capitalism? Un-
fortunately, too many people are limited to this
dollars and rubles yardstick.

A visitor who stays long enough in the Soviet
Union also discovers the social yardstick. By that
measure the U.S. and other major capitalist l-ands
are far behind and are steadily getting farther
behind. The Soviet Union is developing a social
humanism at a time when the advanced capitalist
lands are experiencing a stage of increasing social
degeneration, psychiatric disorder, and a departure
from elementary human decency.

It is hardly necessary to observe that the U.S.
role as world policeman for capitalism and its na-
palm savagery in Vietnam have contributed to dis-
torting normal behavior or normal thinking of
many in the U.S. But the historic source of de-
generation under capitalism, the economic insecur-
ity and craze for the magic dollar, and worship of
private proﬁt, from which stems so much crime,
have reached a new low in rich America.

THE SOVIET UNION is building up to-
wards the biggest rip-roaring celebration in
history. The high point of that celebration,
the 50th anniversary of the revolution that
ushered in the ﬁrst socialist republic, is still
a year off.

But already months before the 49th
anniversary, Nov. 7, 1966, the drive was on
towards the 50th. This was evident not only
in slogans on banners Wherever you turned
in the Soviet Uni-on this summer, but especially in
the fast-spreading movement for new levels of
production, quality and «distinction in every sphere
of life, as the way to mark the half century of
socialism.

During my extensive visit in 19159, I saw the
start of the seven-year plan. My visit in the sum-
mer of 1966 coincided with the beginnings of the
new ﬁve-year plan and the -inauguration of the
new economic reforms.

THE ‘‘50TH’’ marks the historic fact that the
state of workers and farmers which “experts” pre-
di-cted would live only weeks or months, survived

There is hardly such inﬂuence in the character
of the Soviet men and women. For people seeped in
capitalist dollar psychology, it is hard to imagine a
modern society, 20 percent more populous than ours,
where money is far from everything. The Soviet
people live more modestly than most of us, but they
are secure at that level.

There isn’t a beggar to be found in the USSR.
There is no home relief or public relief or any
charity such as we have, to a total of some seven
million in this sixth year of the boom, and the
corroding inﬂuence it has on men, women and
children. There is no chronic unemployment such
as we have and its effect on people.

A family in the USSR may .be of the lowest
means, but it is just as much protected by law as
the next family and is entitled to complete free
medical care, free higher education plus a stipend,
law-provided annual vacations, a right to resorts
at a trivial nominal cost, and to be in line for a
new apartment at near-free rental.

MOSCOW, its population nearing New York’s
hasn't a -single family on public relief, while New
York has 600,000 on public welfare in the midst of
the boom. ’

Neither in Moscow nor in any other Soviet city
is there anything resembling a New York Bowery,
where the latest survey showed 9,000 derelicts, who
are in a state of hopeless al-cholic degeneration.
Every city in America has its Bowery.

You ask a Soviet citizen if there is narcotic ad-
diction and he gives you a puzzled look as though
he didn’t know what you are talking about. And
when you explain that in New York City the gov-
ernment says there are 30,000 “known” addicts
who are the source of half the city’s crimes, they
look at you as though you came from some planet
of lunatics.

Socialist Humanism

THE SOVIET PEOPLE do hear a little of our
uninterrupted crime rise since the war, and es-
pecially the bad situation among jobless youths, but
most of them imagine it is no worse than what they
call “hooliganism.” There is no organized crime in
the Soviet Union. A gang couldn’t last a week.
Th-ere is no prostitution.

I found no “sexology” department in any book-
store, nor is there anything comparable to the
hundreds of bookshops in the U.S. specializing in
pornographic pocketbooks and pictures.

Children by the millions are attached to an as-
sortment of care centers from nursery and kinder-
garten until the higher teens.

30

 

 

In the Soviet Union people are not troubled
with health bills. Nor do they have to lay aside
for an education fund to assure higher education
for children. Those are free public services.

To Americans a society where there is no racist
pattern and where children are not forced into a
racist “ethnic” Dattern from earliest days, may‘
seem almost inconceivable. But in the Soviet Union,
the most multi-national of any state in the world,
there is no visible racism and no hidden or open
organizations advocating racism or printing racist
slop such as flows through America's mails.

PUT TOGETHER all the above and many other
similar factors, and you have a vast difference be-
tween the U.S. and USSR. on what makes up the
relations between people.

How explain the amazingly clean streets of USSR
cities, or the cleanliness of the subways? You don’t
see seats on Soviet subways or buses defaced
with shameful crayoned unprintable words. How
explain the operation of the honor payment system
on Soviet buses, with no conductors to collect
fares? How explain the politeness of youth to the
elders?

Of course the leftovers of the past are still to be
found. But the important thing is that in the Soviet
Union they are combatting the evil and back-
wardness that has been accumulating in people for
ages and they are developing a new humanism and
a true brotherhood relation between people.

Looking back 50 years in terms of the human ele-
ment in the “American Way of life,” can we say
that such progress was made here?

a half century despite seemingly insurmountable
diﬂiculties, military invasions and economic block-
ades that seriously threatened its life.

Even more signiﬁcantly, the 50th marks the
maturity of socialism and the solid basis for it in
the store of well-tested experience that is today
recognized as the general guide for socialist devel-
opment in this historic period.

This needs to be especially emphasized today in
View of the inﬂuence of what Lenin, in his time,
called “infantile sickness” in the Marxist move-
ment. This affliction is today strong in the lead-
ership of the Communist Party of China.

We even hear an echo of the cries from Peking
among certain intellectuals on the fringes of the
Left in the United States who also s-ee in the
USSR’s economic reforms a trend “back to cap-
italism.” How very much like the cries out some
people back in 1921 who denounced Lenin’s New
Economic Policy (NEP) as -a return to capitalism!

In Seven Years

WHAT COUNTS today, as always, are the hard
realities and results.

I recall how the “experts” greeted the 195-9-
1965 plan. An 80-percent growth in seven years?
InconceivaJble! Impossible!

Well, -the plan ended with an 84 percent growth.

The national income rose -by 53 percent, and

_ there are no capitalists, landlords, high-priced ex-

ecutives or racketeers in the USSR to share any
of it.

Those results must be seen against the fact
that the USSR lost 20 million men, a high per-
centage out its skilled manpower and 30 percent
of its wealth in the Nazi invasion.

Steel production rose from 54.9 million tons a
year to 91 million tons in the seven years; electric
power from 235 billion kwh to 507 billion; oil
from 1l‘3 million tons to 243 million; natural gas
from 29.9 billion cubic meters to 129 billion; coal
from 493 million tons to 578 million tons; cement
from 33.3 million tons to 72.4 million tons; tractors
from 220,000 (in 15 horsepower units) to 355,000;
mineral fertilizers from 12.4 million tons to 31.3
million tons; metal-cutting lathes from 138,000 to
185.000.

THE MAGNITUDE of those ﬁgures can be judged
from the fact that just the Lenin hydro-electric
power plant near Kuybishev, on the Volga which
I visited in 1959, generates today TWICE as much
power annually as the total capacity of the USSR
in 1928, ﬁve million kwh, when the ﬁrst ﬁve-year
plan w-as launched. Between 1928 and 1965 steel
and oil output expanded 21 times, coal 16 times,
cement 39 times, and metal-cutting lathes 93 times.

The USSR put strong emphasis historically on
heavy industry. But there has been some narrow-
ing of the gap between heavy industry and the
consumer industries.

Fabrics rose from 7.5 million linear meters dur-
ing the seven years to 9.1 milion meters; knitt-ed
goods from 496 million units to 907 «million; foot-
wear from 356 million to 486 million pair; sugar
from 5.2 million to 8.9 million tons; television sets
from 979,000 to 3,655,000; refrigerators from 360,000
to 1,675,000 units.

Agriculture, still the weakest sector, showed a
smaller rise in the seven years. In terms of com-

parable prices, output rose from 46.7 «billion rubles-

to 52.3 billion. Meat rose from 7.9 million tons to
9.3 million; milk from 57.2 million tons to 64.7
million; raw cotton from 4.4 million tons to ﬁve
million; wool from 317,000 tons to 3-61,000.

Towards A Better Life

HOW ARE THE above statistics reﬂected in life?
The change is apparent the minute you drive out
of an airport toward the city, be it Moscow or any

other city. 3

You are struck by the vast stretches of new
apartment buildings—many thousands of them, that
ring cities like Moscow, Leningrad or Kiev. They
go up at an amazing pa-ce.

When you see the endless stretches of new hous-

ing, and‘ new wide parkways and subway ‘lines

stretching towards them, you begin to -comprehend
the meaning of the report that in seven years 17
million new city apartments and rural houses
were built, increasing the the USSR’s total hous-
ing by 40 percent. In addition millions of apart-
ments were renovated. In the deca-de 1954-63, 108
million persons, nearly half the USSR’s population,

,_moved to new or renovated housing.

The picture is by no means all bright. Many
families are still very crowded, still forced to share
kitchens and bathrooms. I saw some very bad
housing conditions in parts of old Moscow in
buildings that undoubtedly will be due for wreck-
ing soon.

The important point is that the Soviet Union
is making steady gains on the housing front, and
plans call for an even faster pace.

M0-ST INTERESTING in the seven years that
saw rents in the US. skyrocket, was the continu-
ation of _the same national standard monthly rent
scale in the USSR that I noted during the visit
in 1959-—approximately 13.2 kopecks per square
meter.

That means a monthly rent for the average
family, including utilities, of about six or seven

5

 

  

rubles monthly-—$6.60 to $7.70 a month. The rate
is the same in old as in new apartments.

I hasten to add that at the above monthly rentals
the Soviet apartments are not as roomy or as well
equipped in kitchen and bath, as a comparable U.S.
apartment in a new ‘building renting for $110 to
$125 mon-thly. But the difference is tar, far greater
ﬁnancially than in comfort.

Orutweig-hing the high—priced U.S. comfort ad-
vantage are the inevitable child-care centers and
after-school recreational, cultural and hobby cent-
ers that go along with the new housing projects.

PRICES IN GENERAL have not changed in the
seven years. Most pr-ice-tags are exactly the same.
From my personal observation there were signiﬁ-
cant price reductions on cameras, ‘TV sets, radios,
sports equipment, electrical appliances, vacuum
cleaners and washers, watches and toys. There
seems to be some small changes in food prices, but
the total food bill generally seems to -run about the
same.

A subway ride is still ﬁve kopecks, buses four
kopecks, a public phone call two kopecks, and taxi
fares about half our rates. One of the -best buys
in the USSR is a theatre ticket ranging in price
from 60 kopecks to 3.50 mnbles for the best seats.

The price picture adds up to the fact that the
statistical average 20 percent increase in money
wages-—from 78 rubles monthly to -95—for the work-
ers since 1959, has been 'a REAL increase. It stuck!
In addition, the work day was cut from eight to
seven hours.

Soviet citizens told me that the purchasing power
of the ruble has increased somewhat in seven years.

But, most welcome to the Soviet people is the
greatly improved opportunity since 1959 for spend-
ing their money. Goods are much more plentiful
and there is a better choice. The relative improve-
ment is noticeable.

The combination of more in the pay envelope
and more goods on the shelves brings such crowds
to shopping areas on any week day in the year
such as you may see in the U.S. during the days
before Christmas. The people seem to have lots
of money to spend. Apart from the food bill, ex-
penses for home and transportation are very low.
They have no medical -or education costs. Oultural
expenses run very low. So they have a large part
of -their pay envelope for the stores.

1966-1970 Goals

THE NEW, 1966-70 Five-year Plan, the plan that
passes over into the Soviet Union’s second half-
century, marks a new and higher stage in the
country's development. The unprecedented pace of
growth set -and surpassed for the seven-year plan

is to rise substantially in the ﬁve years. Agricul-
ture, which has lagged considerably in the earlier
plan, is to be brought up 25 percent, in stride with
the growth of the rest of the economy, The gap
between industries producing the means of produc-
tion and those in consumer goods is to be narrowed
signiﬁcantly. The difference in life and living stand-
ands between town and country is to be narrowed.
The living standards ofthe people is to rise faster
than in the past. The economic level achieved by
the USSR makes possible the new goals and re-
forms_

WHAT STRIKES you most after you are in the
Soviet Union for a while -and come in contact with
the ordinary affairs odf the people, is the close re-
latio-n between the objectives of the new ﬁve-year
plan and the new problems that have arisen out of
the every-day life of the people. The condition that
has enabled the country to raise ‘purchasing power
and to supply far greater quantities of goods and
more variety, has also encouraged in the Soviet
people a new trend -as customers. The people want
more things, they want higher quality, variety,
more-u;p-to—sd-ate wares, latest styles, better serv-
ices.

The high percentage of youth, a very big inﬂu-
ence in the country’s life and the unmatched high
level of education in the country, has also become
a pressure force for more attention to new prob-
lems. The younger generation. does not look so much
at past levels for comparison as at the new pos-
siibilities.

It is interesting to watch shoppers. They don’t
grab anything. In earlier years I noted they would
buy things almost blind, overlooking defects, and
be glad to get them. They now insist on more qual-
ity, style and the models they want.

The key ﬁgures in the new 1966-70 ﬁve year
plan are the following: While in the previous ﬁve
years heavy industry rose 58 percent and consumer
goods production by 36 percent, the new ﬁve year
plan envisions a rise in all industry by from 47-50
percent with heavy industry up by 49-52 percent
and consumer industry up 43-46 percent. Real living
standards are to go up by 30 percent in 5 years
against the 20 percent in the past seven years.

HAVING INHERITED a most -‘backward land,
and forced to spend much of its wealth on defense
against invasion for almost the entire half century
of the USSR’s history, the measure was quantity.
Every enterprise -had quotas to meet, set by the re-
spective ministry and chose the easiest way to ﬁll
them, often with disregard to quality and popular
choice. Sale was assured.

In agriculture, too, the heavy handed directives
from above, and inequity in setting the prices the

7

   

government paid to the collective farms, discour-
aged faster expansion and the kind of products the
country most needed to further industrial progress.
The high price collectives had to pay for machin-
ery and insuﬁicient emphasis on mineral fertiliz-
ers, were other drawbacks.

Profit For Whom?

IT BECAME increasingly apparent that the So-
viet Union has not fully used its potential for even
more rapid progress because insufficient attention
was paid to the power of material incentives to
the worker, collective farmer and technical person-
nel. As Leonid Brezhnev, secneta-ry of the Commu-
nist Party of the Soviet Union said in his report to
the party’s 2=3r-d Congress last March, “Since social-
ism is a. society whose principle is payment for
labor according to its quantity and quality, this
presupposes the operation of economic stimuli, of
material incentives, and the drawing of millions of
working people into the management of the coun-
try’s economic life.”

This summarizes the essential principle on which
the new economic reforms are based. They provide
greater incentives to workers for higher produc-
tivity, more rights and initiative to management of
an enterprise as well as more involvement of the
workers in its aﬁairs; greater emphasis on quality
and accommodation to the buyer’s wishes an-d
orders, with the major test of eﬁiciency not only
how much is turned out, bu-t how much of a good
quality is produced and proﬁtable -sale is realized.

Instead of just working on instructions of the
ministry of which it is «a part, the enterprise re-
ceived authority to make contracts with the whole-
sale purchasers, be they stores, institutions or fac-
tories. The enterprise ﬁlls orders in line with de-
mand. Production is concentrated on what is most
needed and on items the retailer knows are in de-
mand. The enterprise is required to be self—sus-
taining and must no longer depend on the ministry
to ﬁll its requirements without regard to whether
it is operating at a loss or a proﬁt.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN that the Soviet Union
is going “back” to the “proﬁt system” as some
ultra-leftist and capitalist critics of -the Soviet
Union say. Soviet industry always strives t-o realize
a proﬁt. But it was never proﬁt for individual or
private owners. Socialism was never against proﬁt
per se. Socialism is against appropriation of proﬁt
by private individuals through the exploitation of
the labor of others. Just as money was retained
under socialism as a measure of value so is proﬁt
an indication of whether an enterprise operates
efficiently. But the proﬁts go to the government -for

8

 

 

public expenditures. The economic reform simply
ﬁxes the responsibility for operating proﬁtably on
each enterprise —-‘ its management and employes
—- by -also providing incentives in the form of
sharing the higher proﬁts through year-end
bonuses for the workers; higher monthly earnings
as production rises, and a larger share for the “en-
ter.prise fund” that goes for improvements in hous-
ing, health, child care, passes to vacation resorts
and such social ‘beneﬁts for the plant community.
Similarly in -agriculture, collective farms have
been given higher prices to stimulate higher output
and more of the farm products most in need. This
was coupled with a step-up in production of farm
machinery at reduced prices and more chemicals for
fertilizer, and other such aids to agriculture.

INTERVIEWS WITH Soviet trade union leaders,
members of factory committees and people in fac-
tory management where the reforms are already
applied, gave me some indication of the far-reach-
ing possibility in the reform. M’Jana~gement gets
more rights at the factory level. Efficiency through
technology and ‘better organization of a factory can
also involve reduction of personnel. This was dis-
counted by both management and union people
everywhere because at the moment the Soviet
Union is literally crying for more workers, even
in s-ome unskilled categories. But this may raise
problems later, they conceded, So has the factory
committee of the union a greater power and respon-
sibility to look out against management abuses of
workers’ rights while striving for “proﬁtability.”
Also there is a new role for the factory committee
to see to it that higher proﬁts are properly shared
and the workers are not shortchanged.

From my personal observation, as well as from
what many observers told me, the workers of the
Soviet plants are far from physical speedup. The
pace is nowhere near the drive on America's as-
sembly lines. One reason is that the USS{R’s unions
enforce the rule that eﬁicienscy must not come at
the expense of the health of the workers.

Under the reform, the non-production workers of
a plant are pro—rated a share in the proﬁts and
bonuses so that the whole enterprise is interested in
raising the plant’s efficiency and proﬁtability.

UNDER THE OLD system a plant placed orders
for new equipment with the ministry often when
the need for it was not very serious, as they didn’t
have to pay for it. Consequently there is much
little-used ‘or even unused equipment that may be
very much needed elsewhere. The reform requires
a. plant to pay a. six percent levy on all plant
equipment. So there is a drive on in many plants to
sell unused equipment to plants that need -it, and
save on the tax. In the Moscow Timiryazov indus-
