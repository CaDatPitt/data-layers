5 5th Convention Guidelines

DEN VER——Guidelines for new and more significant.
advances by Mine-Mill were laid down here for delegate
action in the annual officers’ report prepared for delivery
by President John Clark to the 55th convention’s opening

session, Aug. 29.

Speaking in behalf of the union’s Executive Board,
Clark declared that while the months since the last con-
vention were “exceedingly difficult for this organization,

they have also been very gratifying” in that “they have ,

proven, if further proof is required, that the International

Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers is still the
only union capable of waging
a succe_ssful fight for the in-
terests of non-ferrous metals
workers.”

This was attested to, he add-
ed, by the fact that “in a pe-
riod when several larger and
wealthier unions suffered de-
feats, our membership fought
and won the longest nation-
wide strike in the history of
this industry.”

=8 II‘ =l4

IN A REVIEW of bargain-
ing developments before and
during the six-month strike,
the union’s president high-
lighted some of the “historic
and concrete gains,” above and

beyond the general wage in- -

crease package, won in the set-
tlements that ended it. These
included, he said:

A substantial advance to-
wards the elimination .of the
Southwest differential in Ken-

necott which should pave the
way for eventual elimination
of all discriminatory differen-
tials in the industry; for the
first time, a uniform and supe-
rior -‘health and welfare bene-
fits schedule for American
Smelting & Refining proper-
ties, including a major medical
benefit for: employees ‘and de-
pendents with employee ben-
efits fully paid by the com-
pany and very low employee
contribution for dependent cov-
erage.

Also: for the first time, sev-
erance pay plans in some basic

. sections of the industry; vir-

tual uniformity in medical-hos-
pitalization plans in Arizona, a
long sought objective; substan-
tial miner’s rate reclassifica-
tion in Butte, plus, for the first
time, substantial protections
against layoffs of older work-
ers, as well as a uniform joint-
ly-administered hospital-medi-

Higher Operating Costs
Increased Union lncome—Dichter

DENVER — Action for
strengthening the union’s fi-
nancial structure not only to
maintain but expand its serv-
ice to the membership was
urged on the delegates here by
Secretary-Treasurer
Dichter in his annual report
prepared -for delivery to the
55th convention.

“We should examine a long-
range program which in-
creases the Interna-tiona.l’s in-
come, raises a substantial
strike fund and does the same
for our local unions,” Dichter
stated in his report.

In a review of operating in-
come and expenses, he empha-
sized the fact that Mine-Mill’s
financial problems, no differ-
ent from those faced by many
other unions, stem m ainly
f r om the continual rise in
costs covering every phase of
day-to-day operation.

that “our union, like every
other union, will be facing in-
creasingly greater problems in
the immediate future,”» Dich-

The outlook for strengthen-

strike funds on a sound, long-
range basis should also in-
clude the building of a healthy
reserve, he said.

BEYOND THESE, Clark's

report noted, “we vastly im-

working rules and past prac-

These are gains, he said,
.“which the companies told us
were ‘unrealistic’ and ‘out of
this world’ before we convinced‘
them otherwise . . . gains far
exceeding anything offered or
apparently considered by the
companies before and during
the early days of the strike.”
Connecting these advances
with general perspectives for
future ‘bargaining, he called
the delegates’ “most serious

placement of men through the

President's Corner:

Where Is the Labor

,Movement Heading?

INE—MILL in its traditional and historic way is pre-
paring for its annual convention. Although this con-
vention was postponed because of the national strike sit-
uation it has not taken away the importance of some
issues facing this union which need open and full discus-
— - sion by the representatives of the local un-
ions of the International. As a matter of
fact, some of these issues have become more
vital and of greater concern as time has been
' rolling along. .
The political picture facing the nation
after the outbursts of the two party con-
ventions, has become more clouded and less
understandable to the average citizen. The
vacillating supposed leadership of labor has
in no way given the rank and file of labor
 any confidence to follow their advocations
mm or support of political leadership.
Just a quick glance back at the picture

. Clark
before the merger of the two labor groups in political and
legislative actions shows a more unified understanding of labor
and its problems in these fields. Today’s vacillating and sancti-
monious top leadership cannot solidify the vote of labor’s forces.

‘A'**

HAT has labor’s top leadership done about the fact that
over five million American workers are facing unem-
ployment due to automation and technological improvements
which are squeezing their way into every industry; or about
the fact that those supported in the last congressional election
failed to enact any down-to-earth social legislation, but instead
slapped these labor leaders in the face by passing the Kennedy-
Landrum-Griffin Act and shackling the whole labor movement
which is paying for the ivory towers from which these leaders
operate—mostly to the disadvantage of the dues-paying mem-
bers‘?
(Gompers and Debbs must by this time have squirmed holes
in their coffins at the actions of those who have dared to try
to fit in their shoes.)

The old adage of chickens coming home to roost was never
more applicable than it is today in the labor movement. Divi-
sion, and letting the enemies of organized labor conquer, is
the open theme of some of these labor leaders. Their practice
is open warfare in the form of raids, not with a program of
benefits for the worker, for their contracts often show less
benefits than the existing contracts of unions being raided.

This, of course, creates further division of the workers

and aids, abets, and implements the" bosses’ program of further-
ing more repressive labor legislation. '

***k

I, of course, realize that perhaps no amount of sarcasm or
criticism can veer this trend, but I am sure that, later, labor

history will have a very special place for these leaders and
their policies. »

There is, however, a heartening trend among some leaders
who have seen fit to disagree with the top AFL-CIO brass, both
on political, legislative and foreign policy issues. This opposition
could well develop toward bringing back organized labor into
its rightful role, and as a political force to contend with. A
, Let us hope that these leaders, who are viewing withno
light concern the subjective trend being followed, continue their
progressive role. It could mean the return to the principles

and policies that the American labor movement was primarily .

organized for."

‘k at ‘k V

T must be demoralizing and sickening for a Mazey, a Rosen-

blum, a Gormon, or a ‘Curran, with their avowed views on
world peace versus nuclear War, to sit in on the conclave of top
labor leaders and hear some of the irresponsible statements
which have been issued by those who show no concern for the
ultimate effects of what can happen to all humanity unless a
deterrent is found for this atmosphere of madness.

New Jersey’s Governor Robert Meyner, speaking on a
campaign launched to build bomb shelters in preparation for a
nuclear war, said: “I believe I can best serve the people of my
State by making clear to them that there is only one defense
against a nuclear war-—and that is peace. Either we create a.
situation of safety, security, and sanity for the human race in
this world, or we destroy the precarious conditions that make
life on this planet possible.”

I know some of these problems are in the minds of our

"membership, and the avenue of expression and advocation is

our convention with its usual democratic way of acting on such
issues. I am sure the delegates are coming prepared and will
take the lead in channeling the action of the International on.
all vital problems facing us.——JOHN CLARK. '

Idaho Strike Continues SoIid—AidGrows

KELLOGG, Idaho—“Strike so1id—-support good.”
This thumbnail comment by leaders on the scene
pretty much describes the situation in the four-month old
, strike by Local 18 against the Bunker Hill and‘American
' ‘Smelting & Refining companies in the Coeur d’Alenes.

.More than 2,000 mem-
»bers. of the local have been
 on strike at Bunker Hill’s op-
erations since May 5 and at

,_ A_S&R’s Galena, Page and Jack
"Waite mines since. May 25.

The‘ shutdowns came after

.V’months of negotiations failed
‘ to move the companies toward
’ any serious contract offer or

consideration of long-standing
jévorkers’ problems on the job.

 I -Asfrom the very beginning,

the strike continues to hold
firm with local and ladies aux-
, iliary committees operating ef-
' - ficiently on all phases of ac-
tivity.— picket duty, welfare,
* strike store and kitchen, so-
licitation, publicity, entertain-
 "ment and many other func-
 tions.

‘ ‘Trade union and public sup-
‘ port is shaping up rapidly.
' Each day’s mail brings new in-
" dications of increased strike

assistance. With the coopera-
tion of organized farmer
"groups, tons of fruits, vegeta-

‘- bles and most food staples

have been secured at greatly

\ reduced prices.

>3 *3 *

LPRUCKLOADS of food,
. ._: some bought and some con-
_,tributed, have been hauled in
‘ '-from southern Idaho; and parts
. of neighboring Washington.
‘‘ Through the help of union
‘ truckers and others, the cost
T, .'of transporting commodities
 has been greatly reduced or,
 in some cases, entirely elim-
  inated. ‘
V _ In one week last month, 20
1 ‘S: tons of potatoes, onions, sugar

 ered as a donation from south-
 ern, Idaho, including the cost

‘u -_help carry the fight through
. ‘ ,;,to successful conclusion came

-«-..~top officers with a call to all
‘, Mine-Mill locals for contribu-

Local 515 Units
Reject AZ. Pend
Oreille Proposals

’METALINE FALLS, Wash.
—Workers at American Zinc
Company’s Grandview prop-
erty and Pend Oreille Mines
and Mills Company voted here
Aug. 12 to continue working
as before under extensions of
their present agreements with
the right to cancel on 24

Pend Oreille is a subsidiary
to Bunker Hill whose opera-
tions in the Coeur d’Alenes of
Idaho were shut down by
Mine-Mill Local 18 on May 5.

Grandview and Pend Oreille
managements have been in
negotiations for months with
Mine-Mill Local 515 which rep-

Members in both units also

said, asking that they make
immediate financial contribu-
tions to the Coeur d’Alenes
strikers in order that this at-
tempt by the operators to
break the union can be
stopped." '

’>c<>t==r<

MEANWHILE, no honest
move has been made on the
part of the companies to even
attempt to get together ‘on ne
gotiations to settle the strike
sinceit started.‘ On ‘the con-
trary, management spokesmen
have turned to around-the-
bush propaganda for a local
vote on returning‘ towork.

This was effectively an-
swered in the union’s local
paper, Spotlight, with an open
letter to management which
said in effect: “We’ll vote, all

right, when you honestly put ‘

your total contract proposals
in writing on the bargaining

table for all to see and care-,

fully examine.”

Expose of I n ation
        ’   W k

Racketeers at or

JUST RECENTLY read a pamphlet written and dis-

tributed by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine
Workers Union‘ entitled: :“The Inflation Racketeers.” It’s
an expose of the entire. grandiose-publicity barrage to
blame labor and wage increases for inflation
and high prices. There have been millions
and millions of dollars spent on advertising

and “news” stories tosell this quack eco-
nomic medicine to. the public since World

How many times have you heard the
remark that “Every time we get a wage in-
crease prices go up?” Such remarks are
the result of the “brain washing” job that
big business has done on the American pub-
lie for the past 15 years through all sorts

The simple fact is that, in most.cases,

Skinner

the cost of wage increases represent a very small percentage of
price increases. In many companies the rapid increase in pro-
duction, automation, and elimination of jobs, during the past
10 years, has more than overcome the increased labor costs for

the same period . . . but prices continued to-go up and up!
What really’ causes high prices? »
* ‘Ir 19:

ID you know that in 1958, with over 5 million men. out of r

work and millions moreon short workweeks, national price
averages increased almost 2%?

Did you know that Princeton University in a recent study
of 50 American companies found‘- that . while the number of
increase

at“ * at
ID you know that in 1957 General Motors made the ‘fol-
lowing breakdown of average costs to build a car: 0

Cost of Labor ...........  ..................................... ..$ 300 per car 0
Cost Of Materials ......  ................. .. ................ ,. 1,000 per car
Cost of Overhead (Advertising, etc.)._-; ...... -. 550 per car
Company profit .............................................. .. 313 per car

Of course, on top of this goes distribution costs, dealers’
profit, etc. A ' . '

Now we can see that “labor costs” are approximately 15%
of the total cost of building an automobile. So what’s all the
smoke about high labor costs causing high auto prices?

DID YOU KNOW that the Senate Subcommittee which
studied automobile prices found that the “big 3” of the auto
industry was spending well over one BILLION dollars a year
in advertising to convince the public that the car you now own
is obsolete and what you need is a brand new beautiful $4,000
time payment plan?

These items are only a small part of the story about what

causes high prices.

**‘A'

. O, whethere you buy a railroad ticket, a refrigerator, an

automobile, or even a bottle of aspirin . . . you are paying
for unnecessary advertising, an overloaded management, un-
necessary overhead, thousands of salesmen, and overloaded
profits.

The amount of money spent on advertising has more than
doubled from 1950 to 1960. This year an estimated 12 BILLION
dollars will be expended for advertising in the United States-
advertising largely designed to convince us to buy something
we dont need, at a price we can’t afford, on monthly install-
ments we can barely meet!

But, to make matters worse, the -high cost of living in-
cludes huge advertising budgets so that these corporation pub-
licity men can tell everyone it's the working man’s fault that
prices are so high .  . brother!—ALBERT C. SKINNER.

 

Congress Roadblocks Stall

BY AUG. 22, the Senate had
passed a compromise mini-
mum wage bill and was debat-
ing three contrasting propos-

'als for aged medical care. Both,

faced cloudy futures in the
House.

The Senate wage bill, which
went to a joint conference
committee with a much weak-
er one earllier passed by the
House, would increase the
present $1 wage floor to ‘$1.25
an hour by 1963 and extend
coverage of the Fair Labor

other four million workers.

workers. ‘

nance committee, calls for fed-
eral grants to the states to help
expand or develop old age as-
sistance programs to meet
medical costs. A proposal by

Issues 5-Point Check List

EL CERRETO, Calif.——A 5-point check list for realistic political action inlthe
coming election campaign was recommended last month to eight northern California

Mine-Mill locals.

The PAC blueprint was laid out at a meeting of the union steering committee in
the Local 266 hall here July 30 which followed up the decisions of Mine-Millfs Cali-

fornia Political Action con-
ference held in' the same
hall three weeks earlier.
Participating in the steering

cal 871. , ‘ ;
Each local and political ac-
tion committee was urged to:
1. Prepare lists of members
with addresses and phone num-

_ bers.

2. Check each membeiyiwife

age to see if they are regis-’r

tered to vote.

3. If not registered, make

A_GENERAL discussion by
the steering committee mem-
bers covered all aspects bf po-
litical action, including the
need to involve the rank and
file, the necessity of all locals
playing their proper part in
local, county, state and na-

- tional PAC work, and the im-

portance of cooperation with
other unio-ns and organizations
with the same objectives as
Mine-Mill.-

The discussion revealed that

while some locals have politi-
cal action committees, they are
not active enough. The steer-
ing com1nittee’s recommenda-
tions are designed to. perk up
local PAC work on a sound,
operating basis with some
weight behind it.

Jim Buck and Larry Hol-
linger were elected committee
chairman and secretary respec-
tively. Another meeting of the
committee is scheduled for
September 10 at the El Cer-
reto Local 266 union hall.

For National

Sears Boycott g

SAN FRANCISCO—Organ-
ized labor is responding to the
call fora boycott of all Sears '
Roebuck stores in the United
States and Canada issued by
the Retail Clerks International
Association.

Sears fired 262 of its em-
ployees on May 25 for refusing
to cross a Machinists union
picket line. The. Machinists
struck Sears stores in San
Francisco when management
refused to bargain on many

' issues, claiming the company’s

national labor policy -was set
in Chicago. .

Members of the Retail
Clerks, Machinists, Building
Service, Teamsters and the
Building Trades refused _to
cross the IAM picket _line, re-
turning to work only after an
injunction was issued by the
state Superior Court.

is =l¢ :3

ABOUT HALF, the return-
ing workers were fired by
Sears. The Retail Clerks say
that the others have been sub-
jected to company discrimina-
tion for having refused to
cross the picket line. The com-
pany’s “vicious program of ag-
gression”. "Was ‘practiced. de-
spite the fact that the ‘San
Francisco union contracts with
Sears ’ specifically’ provide for
the right. of members to‘ re-
spect legal picket lines. .

Latest support -of the mail

called for a nation-wide boy-

received by 14 workers at
Butte, 18 at Anaconda and four
at Great Falls. The average

payment  thus more than
$8.50. <

The payments are being
made by a settlement with the
company as an alternative to
arbitration. The company had
resisted arbitration and, as a
result, the case had to be
fought through the Federal
District Court in Butte and
the Federal Court of Appeals
in San Francisco.

AFTER the courts upheld
Mine-Mill’s contention that the
matter was arbitrable, the com-
pany indicated its willingness
to sit down and attempt to
settle the matter.

Although the basic question
of the right of workers to con-

tinue working when they reach
68 until they have a total of
15 years’ service remains un-
settled, the matter will come
up again when the present pen-

sion plan expires in 1962. The ‘
is determined to have _, 

union
this matter clarified in the
pension plan and agreement
once and for all.

Also as a result of the court
case, the present agreements
with the company require that
if the company questions ar-
bitrability of any issue, that
question will itself be sub-
mitted to arbitration, so that

long drawn-out and expensive 1
court cases on this matter V,

have now been eliminated.

A STATEMENT issued by
the National Executive Board
which met in Toronto during
August 11-12-13 assured the re-
cently organized Local 1026 of
the full support of the Union
across Canada in the negotia-
tions with Inco.

The statement said that the
successful organization of the
big Inco nickel project at
Thompson was of major im-
portance to the entire Cana-
dian labour movement.

The organization of Thomp-
son completes, in the main, the
uniting of 20,000 nickel'work-

. ers in_ the industry and makes

it possible for nickel workers

Colborne and Thompson to
speak with one voice.

Belgian Profit Motives Seen
Behind Congo-Katanga Crisis

The infant Republic of the Congo is still wobbly on its legs, and its status, at
Mine-Mill press time, was uncertain and the subject ofinternational dispute within the

United Nations.

. The main outlines of the problem inthe Congo emerge from a Welter of con-

Katanga P r e mi e r Moise
Ts.hombe, ‘who has been de-
scribed as pro-Belgian and pro-

Belgium, at home and in the

‘I-IE SAID the fight for jobs
“is the major issue facing the
entire American labor move-
ment today——an issue, unfor-
tunately that is not being

met.”

“The most effective answer
to the problem,” he continued,
“is to create new jobs through
forcing a reduction of the work
week without loss of weekly

Jgy.‘ An issue of that scope
-”1equires the combined efforts

of the entire labor movement

- on many fronts, in bargaining

as well as legislative action.
Mere talk by individual

-unions won’t do the job, he

said, adding:

“The demand for a shorter
work week must now be given
top priority by the American
labor movement.

“We will also have to seek

0' other contract safeguards and

Ways of cushioning the effects
of unemployment despite the
limited effectiveness of such
measures. S. U. B. and sever-
ance pay plans, now won in

‘ _ some of our contracts, should

be extended throughout the

nies should be made to bear

' -the expense of relocating and

retraining workers displaced by
technological change. Higher
pensions and earlier retire-
ment of older workers would
also create additional job op-
portunities. These—and other
measures—p1us, of course, con-
tinued political action, are the
necessary ingredients of a suc-

~ =—"v"'°§"‘essful fight for greater job

ill 3!! 3!!

CLARK also pointed to other
‘serious bargaining problems

it 0 ' requiring careful planning and

coordination, chiefly: the de-
velopment of a more equitable
industry-wide wage structure
to eliminate all existing inequi-
ties, along the lines of prog-
ress already made in Kenne-
cott; and development of a
common perspective on pen-
sions to eliminate the varia-
tion in both benefits provisions

and expiration dates among
different pension plans.

In the report's section on In-
dustry Developments, a review
of the general economic back-
ground closely linked a gen-
eral slackening of the national

economy with its effects on
the non-ferrous metals indus-
try.

Clark again expressed con-
cern over the loss of jobs and
the growth of unemployment
accelerated, he said, “by the
drive of employers to cut costs
by automation, more and more
speed-up, rationalization and
every device promising to
exact more output per man
hour.”

T0 STIMULATE recovery
of the general economy, the
report advocated the following
goals in a national legislative
and economic program:

For promoting ‘production
and employment —— increased
federal aid for housing,
schools, hospitals and other
public works; a progressive
tax structure based on ability
to pay, plugging of loopholes
and Opposition to sales taxes;
revocation of the ‘Administra-
tion’s high-interest, tight
money policy; increased finan-
cial support internationally to

underdeveloped areas to pro- -

mote their economic- growth.

Measures to spread available
jobs——32 or 35 hour work week
with‘ no change _in take-home
pay; amendment of Social Se-
curity act to permit retirement
at age 60; increased federal
scholarship funds ‘for promis-
ing students. -

Security; federal legislation
for uniform 39-week unemploy-
ment compensation benefits in-
creased to 65 per. cent of
straight-time pay; depressed

AS A PROGRAM for the
non-ferrous metals industry,
Clark’s report of the -Mine-Mill
officers proposed measures
which the union has been ad-

' vocating for years, including:

Expanded world-wide use of
metals in the rapid economic
growth of the world’s under-

developed areas; negotiations,

of international commodity;
agreements in copper, lead
and zinc: with a View to

stabilizing production and’-

trade to prevent excessive 
ports; expansion of world_
trade through broadening of
the Reciprocal Trade program
and removal of restrictions 011
U. S. exports of metals and
metal products.

“Until these programs and
greater economic -progress at
home can be achieved,” the
hard-rock miners union ‘presi-

dent said, “we have worked
and will continue to Work, in
consultation with our Cana-
dian’ membership, for what-
ever measures will best pro-
vide immediate protection for
the jobs of our members and
the preservation of the indus-
try in which they are em-
ployed.” '

>Z< * *

IN THAT connection, Clark
recalled the union’s long and
active record in the nation’s’
capital. V

Over these years, he said,
“we have developed and advo-
cated an entirely new concept
of import quota allocation—as
applied to lead and zinc—de-
signed not only to stabilize our
international trade in these
commodities, but to give pref-
erential treatment to imports
from countries with adequate
wage standards.” ‘

“This approach has "since

' been borrowed by other unions

seeking to have it applied to
commodities in which they

he said, “put the union and

“I’?’:=ts entire structure under crit-

ical test. The companies were
certain that we could not sur-
vive a long strike. .Not only
did we survive and win the
strike, but throughout the en-
tire strike period we took care
of the needs of our member-
ship and maintained our or-
ganization.”

If proof was ever needed,
Dichter said, “certainly the

'_ strike proved that a 11nion like

ours must not only be pre-

. served, but strengthened.”

The fact that a large sec-
tion of the membership was
on strike resulted in a sig-
nificant decrease in the un-
ion’s inco.me from per capita,
initiation and reinstatement
fees, the report pointed out.

. A311 the other hand, the first

part of 1959, saw a rise in ex-
penses not only from the in-
crease in normal administra-
tive costs but from increased
organizational activity, includ-
ing collective bargaining and
“considerable organizing work
in the Southwest.

He stressed that all func-

tions of the union, from bar-
gaining to organizing and
from stationery to salaries of
office personnel, are now cost-
her than ever. Landrum-Grif-
fin adds new legal expense to
normal operation. New laws,
new bargaining and industry
problems calling for special at-
tention and expert servicing
will require full or part-time
additions to the staff, he said.

Ditcher also pointed to the
need for a sounder and long-
range financial structure for
the local unions.

190.000 More Get
Security Benefits

’ WASHINGTON, D. C.—-
About 190,000 additional men,
women and children are now
receiving old age, survivors or
disability insurance benefits.
That’s a result of the labor-
supported amendment to the
Social Security law which
went into effect in August
1958. ‘ The amendment was

have been interested,” he
noted.

A MAJOR section of the re-
port was devoted to Political
and Legislative action, discuss-
ing the 1960 elections, candi-
dates and party platforms
against the background of na-
tional and international issues.
These issues, Clark said,
“make it imperative that our
membership participate to the
fullest at every level in the cru-
cially i_rnportan_t elections that
will culminate next Novem-
ber.” '

Significant victories in pri- _
mary elections have already

been achieved in Montana, Ari-
zona and New Mexico, he ob-
served, pointing out that alto-
gether the union’s member-_
ship ranges over 25 states and

will help to elect 68 congress- ‘

men, 14 senators, 11 governors
and 12 state legislatures.

“It is out of these that we
can look for the most fruitful
practical results for our mem-
bership,” he said. He also
urged the membership, where
candidates are endorsed, to
“let them know that our en-

dorsements can be based only _

on the degree of‘ their support
of the program adopted at this
convention.”

TURNING to the record of
the 86th Congress, still in ses-
sion as the report went to press,
Clark ‘remarked that it “ill
compares with the high hopes
that were held for it after the
Democratic. landslide in the
congressional elections of
1958.” .Its failures by omis-'
sion (as in the case of mean-'
ingful civil rights legislation)
were as much on the minus
side as was the passage of the
“outstandingly retrogressive
legislation” — the Kennedy-
Landrum-Griffin bill, his re-
port said. , " .

He characterized the labor
control law as “one of the
most flagrantly discriminatory
pieces of class legislation that
ever went through our Con-
gressional procedures,” and
urged its repeal. «-

On other national legislative
issues, the report emphasized
the need for a mine safety bill
which the union has long ad-
vocated and whose enactment’
is closer by virtue of the Mine-
Mill initiated Public Health
Service study of silicosis in
metal mining now in progress.

SUPPORT was also urged
for the Kasem-Lane bill which
would prevent federal courts
or court-appointed monitors
from running the affairs of
labor unions. The report ex-
pressed concern over “the dan-
gers inherent to the rest of the
labor movement” with the
precedent established in the
case of the Teamsters union.

Recommendations in the re- _ .

port on state legislation cov-
ered unemployment and work-
men’s compensation, mine
safety codes and “right-to-
work” laws. ,

Other major sections of the
report covered» civil rights and
civil liberties, foreign policy,
union defense, administration,
Work of the union in Canada,
and relations of Mine-Mill with
other unions.
