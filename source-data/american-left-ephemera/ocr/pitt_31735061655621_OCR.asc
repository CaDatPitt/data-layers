into instruments of Jim Crow oppression! Thus is the Big Lie of
“Communist force and violence” used to thwart the democratic
aspirations of the Negro people! Thus does the cult of racism merge
with the pro-war, fascist ideology of “anti-Communism”—posing an
added threat to the peace and freedom of our entire nation!

In further preparation for the big Battle of Desegregation, a
racist ideological campaign is getting under way to incite backward
elements among southern whites to ﬁght against the Supreme Court
ruling. Spokesmen for the Dixiecrats are haranguing the “White
Citizens Councils” and other groups with anti-Negro and anti-
Semitic diatribes. Thousands of hate-leaﬂets attacking the Court
decision are being mailed out by such outﬁts as Bowles’
“N.A.A.W.P.” and the “Christian Anti-]ewish Party.” And that
vicious and inﬂammatory “Birth of A Nation” ﬁlm, which pictures
Negroes as brutes and gloriﬁes the KKK night-riders and lynchers,
is just now being refurbished in technicolor—-at the cost of more

than $8,000,000—to spew race hate again from the screens of the.

nation’s theatres.

Against this background of legislative skulduggery, racist per-
secution and mob violence, the attorneys for the Wall Street-Bour-
bon alliance proceed, with gentlemanly decorum, to petition the
Supreme Court to allow them to handle this troublesome question
of desegregation in their own way-and time!

Where Does Eisenhower Stand?

Arguments were scheduled for December 6 on what decrees
the Supreme Court should issue to implement its ruling against
segregated schools; but they were postponed after Mississippi’s Sen-
ator Eastland blocked conﬁrmation of Federal Judge ]ohn Marshall
Harlan’s appointment to the vacancy on the Court. Eastland’s pro-
tracted tenure in the Senate is based on the Jim Crow disfranchise-
ment of most of the citizens in his district; and he is understandably
disturbed over this appointment of the grandson and namesake of
the one Supreme Court justice who dissented in the infamous
Plessy v. Ferguson case of 1896.

Although oral arguments were postponed, briefs were ﬁled by

10

 

 

all parties to the ﬁve desegregation cases involved; and “friend of
the court” briefs were entered by the U.S. Attorney General, the
American Veterans Committee, and at least ﬁve southern states not
directly involved in these cases. The N.A.A.C.P. brief urges the
Supreme Court to order complete school integration by September,
1955, with a leeway o'f one year provided in cases where special
administrative difficulties are met. In general, the briefs by south-
ern states urge the Court to let the Federal District Courts (located
in the South) handle all problems of implemenation, with only
general directions from the Supreme Court; and they call for a
“gradual” approach to desegregation.

Attorney General Herbert R. Brownell’s brief appears to sup-
port both these opposing positions. On the one hand, it includes
many ﬁne-sounding statements of principle, in seeming support of
the N.A.A.C.P. On the other hand, the speciﬁc decrees which the
Attorney General’s brief asks the Supreme Court to issue would
leave things pretty much in the hands of the Federal District Courts,
in obvious support of the basic position of the southern states.

This looks like a clever bit of double-talk. Attorney General
Brownell is well aware of the historic white-supremacist role of the
southern Federal District Courts to which he would give ﬁnal
authority to approve state plans for the integration of white and
Negro schools. Why, then, did he fail to propose a deﬁnite time-
limit, like the N.A.A.C.P.’s September, 1955? Are his ﬁne statements
of principle designed to serve as window-dressing, while the Bour-
bon rulers of the South proceed, through the lower courts which
they dominate, to sabotage the Supreme Court decision by means
of endless litigation and “gradualism”?

These questions take on special signiﬁcance in the light of Presi-
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower’s statement on the school segregation
cases just a few days before the Attorney General’s brief was ﬁled.
The President told a press conference that he was sure the Supreme
Court, in formulating its implementing decrees, would take into ac-
count the emotional strains and practical problems growing out
of this issue. Georgia’s Negro-hating Herman Talmadge, then gov-
ernor, promptly hailed the President’s statement as evidence that

the Eisenhower Administration is moving toward his way of think-

11

 

  

ing on this issue—and there is substantial reason to fear that he is
ri ht.

g Republican Party campaigners made full use of the Supreme
Court decision in their quest for votes in the 1954 elections. But
now that the elections are over, there are ominous signs that the
Eisenhower Administration is trying to make peace with the Dix-
iecrats—at the expense of the democratic rights of the Negro peo-
ple. And the same thing is true of leaders of the Democratic Party,
who began the current session of Congress by making a “gentle-
man’s agreement” with their Dixiecrat colleagues not to “divide the
Party” by pressing for civil rights legislation.

The people of our country dare not rely on these Big Business
politicians to integrate white and Negro schools. The actual aboli-
tion of segregated schools must be won in the same way the Court
victory of last May was won—through even more powerful mass
pressures by the Negro people and their allies.

The People Will Uphold the Law

The ﬁght to abolish segregated schools should be waged with
conﬁdence that the Supreme Court decision can, indeed, be trans-
lated into practice. It is entirely possible for the democratic forces
of the people 'to overcome the diehard opposition of the Dixiecrats
and their agents.

There is a very broad coalition of organizations which are for-
mally committed to support of the Court decision. Among them are
many predominantly white organizations within the South—includ-
ing the Texas C.I.O., the Georgia Federation of Labor (A.F.L.),
the Southern Baptist Church Convention, other Protestant and
Catholic church bodies, the Southern Regional Council, the South-
ern Conference Educational Fund, some newspapers, and many
civic, professional, student and other groups. On the national front
there is an even wider range of groups which have spoken upon
this question-—including A.F.L., ‘C.I.O., the Communist Party,
U.S.A., the National Council of Churches, and many, many more.
Added to these are practically all of the organizations of the Negro
people, North and South—forthright and militant in their demand
for “DESEGREGATION NOW!,” even in the face of actual and

12

 

 

threatened lynch-terror. And the democratic, peace-loving peoples
abroad are watching carefully to see whether our Government lives
up to the Supreme Court pronouncement which the Voice of Amer-
ica was so quick to beam to all the world last May 17.

This broad popular support represents a formidable obstacle to
those who want to sabotage the Court ruling.

That is why most southern governors refused to go along with
South Carolina’s Byrnes, Georgia’s Talmadge and Mississippi’s
White in their open deﬁance of the Supreme Court decision, but
say their states will obey the law. They knew that the people of
the South cherish their public schools, want them improved, are
hostile to proposals for turning them over to private agencies, and
are disposed to abide by the ruling of the Supreme Court.

That is why the Eisenhower-Brownell Administration ﬁnds it
necessary—even though with double-talk—to say they are for deseg-
regation. They feel the pressure of the democratic people’s forces
of our country; and they are especially sensitive to criticisms on
the Negro question from abroad.

It is relatively unimportant whether these southern governors,
the President and the Attorney General are “sincere.” But it is ex-
tremely important that they feel compelled to take a public posi-
tion in support of the Supreme Court decision. The same demo-
cratic people’s pressure which forces them into this official posture
can also force them actually to abolish segregated schools.

Indeed, desegregation is already under way. As N.A.A.C.P.’s
public relations director Henry Lee Moon points out in The Nation
(Dec. 18, 1954), by last fall “four major cities and more than two-
score smaller cities and towns in seven states had begun the process
of integrating their formerly segregated school systems.” White and
Negro Catholic and other parochial schools are likewise being in-
tegrated in several southern states. '

The white supremacist opposition to placing Negro teachers
in-charge of classes which include white pupils is being overcome
in some of these localities; and it can be overcome generally by the
urgent needs of the schools and the pressure of the people. The
schools of our country—already short some 150,000 teachers—simply
caimot dispense with the services of the 113,000 Negro teachers

13

now employed in segregated schools. Moreover, the democratic
people's forces which are able to compel desegregation in the
schools will also have the strength to assure the integration of white
and Negro teaching personnel.

The ﬁght to abolish segregated schools is a winning ﬁght. What
we need most at this time is united and denwnstrative action by
the broad coalition of people’s organizations which support the
ruling of the Supreme Court.

Labor M ust Lead the Way

A few days after the Court decision, the National Committee
of the Communist Party (Daily Worker, May 24, 1954) hailed the
ruling as “a mighty blow against the historic patterns of school
segregation,” and declared: “This decision gives the Negro people
and their friends the opportunity to unite more ﬁrmly in a mighty
coalition to wipe out jim crow in the whole South and in the entire
economic structure of America. This victory opens up the possibil-
itv for the Negro people and labor to march forward more resolutely
along the path of Negro representation in government and all other
areas of life.”

There is no question that the major break-through of last May
17 can become an historic turning-point in the ﬁght to rid our coun-
try of the whole exploitative system of Jim Crow oppression.
Obviously recognizing this fact, the Negro people are pressing right
ahead in their ﬁght to end segregation in the schools and on all
other fronts. Their forward movement must be matched by far
more vigorous activity than is now taking place among their demo-
cratic allies throughout the country. The hundreds of organizations
formally on record in support of desegregation should now speak
out anew.

Organized labor should meet on a regional basis to plan im-
plementation of the Supreme Court decision. It should initiate
and lead community councils to‘ mobilize the people to put the
decision into life.

A. F. of L., C.I.O. and independent labor political action com-
mittees should spark legislative programs in the Congress and State
legislatures to combat Dixiecrat laws and advance anti-segrega-

14

 

tion, equal rights legislation.

Let the Supreme Court receive scores of “friend-of-the-court”
appeals, calling for prompt implementation of the ruling against
segregated schools. _ .,  ,

 Let President Eisenhower and Attorney General Brownell know
that the people want an" end to Jim Crow. V V
Let elected publ1'c'oHicials'and candidates for election—in both

the North and South—be deluged  demands for them to speak ‘

up in support of desegregation.

5 Let there‘ be public mass meetings throughout the country:
“Desegregation __1_’arades” in large cities; ‘delegations, resolutions,
petitions, letters-to-the-editor, and every other form of activity to
register the widespread people’s support for the end of segregated
schools. ' l ’ ‘ '

Let there be thousands of contributions to the Educational
Equality Fund of -the N.A.A.C.P.

The labor movement of our country has a special interest and
a; key responsibility in this struggle. Labor has always pioneered
in the battle for democratic public schools. And only the great
trade-"union organizations of the working class can rally that mas-
sive support which the Negro people now need in this ﬁght to
abolish segregated’ schools. '

Let the trade unions of America now mobilize their millions of
members, especially in'the.South, in active struggle to back up the
ruling. of the -Supreme Court.

This ﬁght to abolish segregated schools is closely bound up
with the ﬁght for economic security, for an end to McCarthyite
repression, and for peace. And only theﬁrm alliance of the labor
movement and the Negro people can provide the basis for that
broad people’s‘ coalition which is necessary to win these gains.

Let the people’s organizations of our country now unite in an
all-out struggle to abolish segregated schools. In the process we
will help weld together those democratic forces which can move
our whole country along the path to jobs, democracy and peace.

THE PEOPLE VERSUS  
SEGREGATED SCHOOLS"
iByl‘DOXEY A. WILKERSON

The Fight to Abolish
Jim Crow Schools

The South is a land of great wealth, with vast natural resources
which ooukl support its people in abundance. Today, instead, most
of that wealth is siphoned oil by the great northern banks and in-
dustrial -corporations, and the people of the South are generally
the most impoverished in the nation. At the very heart of this
contradiction lies the rotten system of ]im Crow oppression, of
which -segregated schools are an integral and important part. i

Economists estimate that industrial employers make over $4,”-
000,000,000 each year in extrwproﬁts (i.e., over and ‘above “normal
proﬁts") by the simple device of paying Negro production workers
less than is paid» white workers. Moreover, this practice operates
to drive down the wage levels of white workers, which means bil-
lions more in added proﬁts to the corporations.

So it is, likewise, with the wages of Negro and ‘white workers
on the farms, with the rents of tenants in the big cities, with re-
tail prices in Negro residential -areas. 'Discriminationagainst Ne-
groes yields super-proﬁts to employers and landlords and com-
mercial enterprises—at the expense not only of Negroes, who suffer
most, but also of the masses of white people. -

Indeed, this is the fundamental purpose of the ]im Crow sys-
tem. And although it is centered in the South, this special oppres-
sion of the Negro people operates to strengthen economic and

3

political reaction throughout the country, and thus to worsen the
conditions of the whole population.

It severely restricts the educational opportunities of Negro
children; but it also reduces the educational opportunities of south-
ern white children to levels far below national standards—by im-
posing the burden of two parallel sets of schools on state and
local budgets which are hardly adequate to ﬁnance even one decent
system of schools.

It opens the way for big industrialists in the North, where trade
unions are strong, to take their “run-away shops” to the unorgan-
ized, low-wage areas of the South,, thus throwing hundreds of
thousands of northern workers out of jobs.

It helps politicians who hate democracy to capture and hold
public oflice through racist propaganda and mass disfranchisement,
thus depriving the people of any effective inﬂuence on ‘state and
local governments in the South.

It saddles the national Congress with more than a hundred
reactionary representatives and some 34 senators, most of whom
betray the interests of the Southern masses, block civil-rights legis-
lation, help impose onerous curbs on organized labor, and strength-
en the drive toward war and fascism in our country as a whole. V

The special contribution of segregated schools in this process
is to permeate the population with race hate and distrust, and thus
to forestall united struggles of the white and Negro people for that
prosperous and democratic South which is their right. The Su-
preme Court decision outlawing segregated schools represents,
therefore, a major blow to the who'le system of ]im Crow oppres-
sion. It marks a great forward step in the strengthening of Ameri-
can democracy.

A Great Democratic Victory

The Negro people have been fighting against gross discrimi-
nation in education for many decades—through petitions, delega-
tions, protest meetings, legislative lobbies, and enormous fund-
raising campaigns. In recent years, under the leadership of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, their

4

 

 

   

emphasis has been on legal action to win “equality” of educational
opportunity in the Negro separate school. Some important victories
have been won—notably in increasing teachers’ salaries, lengthen-
ing school terms, extending school plant and equipment and win-
ning admission to the graduate and professional departments of
state universities.

The cases decided by the Supreme Court on May 17, 1954,’

mark a new high level of this struggle. Arising in black-belt coun-
ties of South Carolina and Virginia, and in Kansas, Delaware and
Washington, D. C., they called, not for spurious “equality” between
separate white and Negro schools, but for the complete abandon-
ment of the Jim Crow school system—for the integration of white
and Negro children in the same schools.

This demand was brilliantly argued before the Supreme Court
by N.A.A.C.P. Chief Counsel Thurgood Marshall and his asso-
ciates. It was actively supported by all the mass organizations
of the Negro people and the entire Negro press. It was endorsed
by the A. F. of L. and C.I.O., by the American ]ewish Congress
and other organizations of the ]ewish people, and by scores of
predominantly white religious, professional, youth, and community
organizations throughout the country.

The campaign for integrated schools was further strengthened
by powerful support from abroad. America’s ]im Crow system is
well known and strongly denounced by the democratic, peace-
loving peoples of the whole world. Criticism of the way Negroes
are oppressed here is especially sharp in the countries of Africa,
India, and Latin America, and in the Soviet Union,‘ China and
the People’s Democracies of Europe—where all forms of racial dis-
crimination are rigidly banned by law. Coming at a time of grow-
ing crisis in United States foreign policy, this pressure from abroad
was a major factor in forcing our Government to make a big con-
cession to the embattled Negro-people and their allies in this
country—to outlaw the segregated school.

The legal issue before the Supreme Court was the same in 1954
as in 1896, when, in the Plessy o. Ferguson case, the Court nulliﬁed
the 14th Amendment. But the political situation was entirely dif-
ferent. Thus, what the earlier Court could do with white-suprema-

5

 

 

cist arrogance, the present Court could not do at all. It had to bow

to the demands of the Negro people and other democratic forces

in our country and throughout the world, when it declared:
“We come then to the question presented: Does segregation

in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physi- p

cal facilities and other ‘tangible’ factors may be equal, deprive the
children of the minority group of equal educational opportunity?
We think it does.”

Let there be no unclarity on this point: The decision outlawing
segregated schools was wrested from the Supreme Court and the
Eisenhower Administration through powerful democratic struggles
by the united Negro people and their allies. It was a great
democratic victory of the people; and its ‘social and political impli-
cations are far-reaching, indeed.

Think what full implementation of the Court’s decision could
mean. Some 9,000,000 white children and 2,600,000 Negro chil-
dren now attending segregated elementary and secondary schools
in the South would be brought together in the classroom and on the
playground. This itself would be a telling blow against racism.
Hundreds of thousands of white and Negro teachers would merge
their professional associations for a common approach to common
problems. White and Negro parents in thousands of communities
would begin to work together in the P.T.A.’s. And this process
of building Negro-white unity could be extended to scores of thou-
sands of youths and their teachers in hundreds of southern colleges
and universities. The impact of this development could do much
to undermine the whole structure of Jim Crow laws and practices
in all ﬁelds.

But this legal victory is still to be realized in practice. All the
Supreme Court has done thus far is to proclaim that segregated
schools_are unconstitutional. Implementing decrees have yet to be
won, and even then the struggle actually to abolish segregated
schools will be long and bitter. Moreover, that struggle cannot be
conﬁned to the educational front alone. There will have to be
powerful and winning assaults against Jim Crow practices in the
even more fundamental areas of job discrimination in industry,
semi-feudal survivals on the plantations, and ghetto housing in the

6

 

 

 

cities. But ‘struggles on these different fronts [mutually sup-_
port one another; and the recent decision of the Supreme Court
enhances the effectiveness of them all. f ’ ” ‘

Ku Klux I<lcmism Deﬁes the Court

If anyone thought last May that ‘‘it’s all over but the shouting,”
his illusion must have been thoroughly shattered by the Dixieicrat,
counter-offensive against the Supreme Court decision.’ ‘The’, ;OP-P0.-__
sition is determined. and sinister, and is now beginning to merge.
with the “Cold War” McCarthyite-fascist attacks against all civil
liberties. _ _ A . V x  _ «.

When beginnings were made inthe fall of 19:54 to integlrate
the schools of Washington, D. C.,,Ba1timore, Maryland, ’an_d.Mil-
ford, Delaware, the white and Negro‘ pupils and their parents:
accepted the. change without incident. Dtesegregation was pro-
ceeding until Bryant Bowles and his so—called “National Associa{
tion for.the Advancement of White People” intervened to organize.
mob violence in _defian_ce__”of the law. Bowles_ appealed to 
lum elements in the communities, by shouting the slogans of Hitler‘
-écalling Negroes “du es”»of Communists a_ndi5‘left-wing_ers,’,’N charg-..
ing that N.A.A.C.P. ‘ osses are Jews,” and whipping up emotional
fervor “to save the ‘white race”. And he. succeeded, ’temV.poyram',ly,_
in disrup-ting the process of school integration. — V

i This Bowles is as disreputable character in his own right, having
been brought into court six times last year. on ‘charges of fraud,
and again for beating up a Negro postman. Even more sinister, he
is the conscious agent of some of the most reactionary Dixiecrat
and pro—f_ascist forces in our country. His purpose in the border
areas was to “demonstrate” that desegregation will notwork, and
thus to discourage any further efforts to apply the Supreme Court
ruling. It is a sad commentary.on the administration of “justice”
in our country that this Negro-hating tool of fascists, when brought
to trial in Delaware for disrupting the public school system, was
acquitted by the court on a technicality!

What happened in Milford, Baltimore and Washington was but

7

a preliminary skirmish in the great Battle of Desegregation still to
be fought out in the Deep South. The Bourbon rulers are busy
with other plans to “save Jim Crow.”

Open deﬁance of the Supreme Court ruling is expressed by the
governors of several southern states. Governor Hugh White, of
Mississippi, for example, told the Pittsburgh Courier (Dec. 11):
“We're not going to pay any attention to the Supreme Court’s de-
C1SlOn.

The political leaders of four states—South Carolina, Louisiana,
Georgia and Mississippi—have put through laws which authorize
them to turn public schools over to private agencies or local school
boards or municipalities for continued operation on a segregated
basis. Their fear and hatred of democracy is so intense that they
would destroy all public schools in order to preserve their cher-
ished and highly proﬁtable system of racial segregation.

Plans are openly discussed in political and educational circles
to gerrymander school district boundaries to conform to segregated
white and Negro residential areas, and to authorized school prin-
cipals to give transfers-out to individual white pupils who happen
to get caught in “Negro districts,” and vice versa. This device sup-
plements the ghetto housing imposed upon Negroes by the banks
and real estate corporations. It has long been used to circumvent
laws “prohibiting” school segregation in the North—with the result
that there are hundreds of Jim Crow schools in New York City,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Los Angeles
and other northern cities with large Negro populations. The Dix-
iecrats are strengthened in their deﬁance of the Supreme Court
decision when a bigot like New York City Superintendent of Schools
William Iansen tries to rationalize this practice as “natural segrega-
tion.”

Moreover, lynch-terror is being organized on a systematic basis
in the South. The “White Citizens Councils” being set up in the
several counties of Mississippi and Alabama, for example, openly
proclaim their intention “to make it difﬁcult, if not impossible, for
any Negro who advocates desegregation to ﬁnd and hold a job, get
credit or renew a mortgage.” Negroes have aptly dubbed these
councils the “Uptown Ku Klux Klan,” and are taking steps to com-

8

5%‘-3

 

 

bat both their economic thuggery and their not-too-veiled threats
of mob violence.

White citizens who advocate desegregation are being labeled
“Communists” and subjected to reprisals. Dr. Lee Lorch, for ex-
ample, head of the department of mathematics at Fisk University,
applied last fall to enroll his two children in a Negro elementary
school in Nashville, Tennessee. Shortly afterward, he was haled be-
fore the House Committee on Un—American Activities on the ground
that some stoolpigeon had called him a “Communist” more than
four years ago; and then he was ﬁred by the executive committee
of the University’s Board of Trustees for refusing to turn informer
before the Congressional Committee. It is ironical, indeed, that a
great Negro institution like Fisk should thus comfort the enemies
of Negro freedom.

In another signiﬁcant challenge to the ]im Crow system, Carl
Braden, a copyreader on the Louisville CorLm'er-Journal, bought a
house last May in a lily-white neighborhood; and then transferred
it to his Negro friend, Andrew Wade IV. The night after the Wade
family moved in, a ﬁery cross was burned beside the house, and
shots were ﬁred through the windows. For several weeks the Wades
were subjected to threats of violence and other pressures designed
to force them to vacate. Then the house was bombed.

The grand jury called to investigate the case returned no indict-
ments against the racists who had been trying to drive the Wades
from their home. Rather, it indicted Vernon W. Bown, a white
friend of the Wades who volunteered to help guard their home-
accusing him of setting 017 the bomb! And it indicted Carl Braden,
his wife and several of their friends—for “advocating sedition”! Said
the grand jury, with typical McCarthyite distortion: “It is very
signiﬁcant . . . that this case seems to follow the pattern used by
the Communist Party in this country to create trouble between the
respective races in this country, and that one of the speciﬁc methods
of doing this is by the purchase of property for Negroes in areas
which normally are occupied by white persons, and then causing
incidents such as this.” Braden was tried, convicted and sentenced
to 15 years in prison and a ﬁne of $5,000!

Thus do the enemies of Negro freedom transform our courts
