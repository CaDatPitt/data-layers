HOW DISCRIMINATION PAID THE RAILROADS

We have already noted that
up until World War I Negro
workers were employed on the
railroads in many categories
long since closed to them. We
have noted too that the large
railroad corporations used Negro
employment for two main pur-
poses, speciﬁcally:

1. As a source of cheap la-
bor.

2. As a means of disuniting
rail workers by on the one
hand hiring Negroes at sub-
standard wages, and on the
other fostering the vilest forms
of racism backed by the ar-
gument that the exploited
Negro workers were unfair
competition for the almost
equally exploited white work-
ers.

It was a classic example of
jim crow serving the proﬁt greed
of big corporations. Here are

 

just a few of the hundreds of
examples of the working of this
exploitation :

—In 1909 the Georgia Railroad
ﬁred 10 white hostlers whose
wages were $1.75 a day, and re-
placed them with Negroes at a
500 cut.

—In 1917 several Southern
carriers made agreements to pay
Negroes $1.75 for the same run
that white ﬁremen were paid
$2.27—a 52c hourly difference.

—Negro train porters have
been used for a long time to do
brakemen’s work. While the
porter receives a few cents more
for doing this added work, his
pay is much less than that of
the brakeman.

—Similarly, Pullman porters
have worked as supervisors-in-
charge of trains, but have not
received conductor’s pay. Din-
ing car waiters have run “in-
charge,” but have been denied
steward’s pay.

‘—In the railway maintenance
shops, Negroes have generally
been hired as helpers. Seldom
have they had the chance to be-
come apprentices and be in line
for promotion to mechanic.
(With increased mechanization
of the roads, Negro laborers are
fast being wiped out.)

 

NEGROES IN RAILROADS

The railroads hired and in-
creased the number of Negro
workers as a source of “cheap
labor” from the time of the Re-
construction Era until World
War I. It was during World
War I that the Negro railroad
workers got their first chance to
hit back at the Cheaper rates
they were paid. Jobs in the
great northern and western in-
dustrial mills and factories were

opened up to them and they left
the railroads in droves.

To halt this exodus, William
Gibbs McAdoo, war-time rail-
road coordinator, issued his fa-
mous equal pay order. It will
be observed that prior to this
time not a single collusive agree-
ment had been entered into by
the roads. Although the rail-
road unions had mistakenly
started campaigns to get Ne-

groes “OH the lines” (instead of
organizing them) as early as
1892, they did not succeed until
after the McAdOo order was is-
sued and the war was over.

Negroes Driven Out After
World War I

During the Reconstruction
Era and right up to World War
II, Negroes were hired through-
out the South as ﬁremen and
trainmen.

In 1890 there were more
than 6,000 such workers. By
1940 this number dropped to
2,000. Ten years later, in
1950, Negroes were less than
2% of the southern ﬁremen.

At the turn of the century,
practically all the yard jobs on
the Norfolk and Western Bail-
road were held by Negroes. But
in 1949 they held only one-
quarter of these jobs. The de—
cline since has been steady. In
road service on this same road
in 1908, Negroes were 90 per
cent of the workers. In 1949 they
held only 2 per cent of the jobs.

In the period between 1910
and 1940 the number of Negro
firemen, trainmen and brakemen
has been cut by more than one-
half.

No wonder that Charles H.
Houston, courageous counsel in
many cases of Negro railroad
men, summed up this shameful
history during the 1949 House
of Representatives hearings on
F EPC before Harlem’s Con-

12

gressman Adam Clayton Powell,
]r., in these words:

. . . The history of Negroes
on the railroads has been a
history of exploitation on the
part of the carriers and sup-
pression on the part of the
Brotherhoods. The carriers
always used them when they
could hire them for fraction-
al percentages or substand-
ard wages.

By now skilled Negro workers

helped to build, back to other
markets as a continual source
of cheap labor.

Negro Women Excluded

The railroad companies in ex-
tending their brutal jim crow
policy have completely excluded
Negro w o In e n. We have
searched high and low for their

employment in any of the cleri-
cal-oﬂice categories without suc-
cess. Is not this practice bring-
ing shame upon our country?

YES, OPERATION EXTER-
MINATION HAS BEEN THE
PLAN OF THE WHITE SU-
PREMACISTS.

OPERATION EQUAL
RIGHTS IS OURS.

THE UNIONS

In many instances, the rail--
road owners camouﬂaged their
own role and purpose by ma-
neuvering the unions to the front
as a “cause and source” of fric-
tion between Negro and white
workers. O

The Role of The Brotherhoods

Under the false illusion of
protecting the jobs of their own
members, the unions’ leaders
yielded to white supremacy, and
played into the hands of rail-
road management. The unions
then must share some of the
responsibility for making the
railroad lines of our country jim
crow locals instead of a “Free-
dom Express.”

There are four main operating
railroad brotherhoods in the in-
dustry. They are the Brother-
hood of Railroad Trainmen
(BRT), the Brotherhood of L0-
comotive Engineers (BLE), the

Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire-
men and Enginemen (BLFE)
and the Order of Railway Con-
ductors (ORC).

The Big Four Brotherhoods
have historically had color bars
in their constitutions which ex-
clude Negro workers from mem-
bership. Practically all of the
other railroad unions (except
the Negro unions) have similar
restrictions. In some instances,
jim crow auxiliaries were set up
with Negro members paying
dues to the parent bodies, but
having no representation on
them or any genuine collective
bargaining rights.

Negro Workers Sounded
Unity Plea

In their age-old ﬁght for ﬁrst
class citizenship, Negro workers
have persistently fought for

their place in every organization
which seeks to promote the wel-

13

fare and the progress of all-
particularly in the unions.

The fact that this ﬁght goes
far back into the history of our
country is attested to by the
stirring speech delivered by
Isaac Myers, Negro Workmen’s
Association delegate to the Na-
tional Labor Union (first Ameri-
can labor federation) conven-
tion in 1869. In a stirring appeal,
Myers asserted:

“. . . Gentlemen, silent
but powerful and far-reach-
ing is the revolution inaug-
urated by your act in tak-
ing the colored laborer by
the hand and telling him
that his interest is common
with yours, and that he
should have an equal chance
in the race for life . . . .

“I speak today for the
colored men of the whole
country, from the lakes to
the Gulf——from the Atlan-
tic to the Paciﬁc-—from
every hill-top, valley and
plain throughout our vast
domain, when I tell you
that all they ask for them-
selves is a fair chance; that
you and they will dwell in
peace and harmony togeth-
er; that you and they may
make one steady and strong
pull until the laboring men
of this country shall receive
such pay for time made as
will secure them a comfort-
able living for their famil-
ies, educate their children

14

and leave a dollar for a
rainy day and old age.

“Slavery, or slave labor,
the main cause of the de-
gradation of white labor, is
no more. And it is the proud
boast of my life that the
slave himself had a large
share in the work of strik-
ing off the fetters that
bound him by the ankle,
while the other end bound
you by the neck.”

Spoken 85 years ago, these
words of Isaac Myers would
have no less urgency today were
they uttered at a union conven-
tion—particularly if it were a
convention of one of the rail-
road brotherhoods.

The appeals of Myers and of
othertfar-seeing men and wom-
en, Negro and white, went un-
heeded. As early as 1892, major
railroad unions entered into
agreements aimed at shutting
Negro workers out of employ-
ment. With the companies ex-
ploiting the antagonisms thus
created to the hilt, there were
instances in which the fratricidal
struggle actually resulted in the
murder of Negro railroad work-
ers.

‘ From the turn of the century
up to the infamous “Washing-
ton Agreement” of 1941, con-
tracts were negotiated with
some twenty—odd railroad com-
panies to deprive Negroes of
equal employment rights. The
most devastating agreements in-
cluded the following provisions:

 

—“Non-promotable” clauses
to bar Negroes from promo-
tion, and even from being hired
in some of the lower classiﬁca-
tions.

—Maximum percentage quo-
tas on employment of Negro
ﬁremen.

—Banning on some lines of
Negroes from any work as bag-
gagemen, flagmen and ﬁremen.

—Designation of areas in
which Negroes are denied hir-
ing rights to ﬁll new runs and
vacancies.

—“Examination” provisions
which state that “promotion
examinations” are to be held
for ﬁreman to engineer. Those
who decline to take the exami-
nation, after having met all
other requirements for promo-
tion, or who fail to pass the
examination, are dismissed
from service.

What has been the cost of all
this to white workers? Lower
wages, less food, poorer houses,
fewer opportunities for the kids.

Negro Workers Forced
To Act Alone

With the scales so heavily
weighted against them, the he-
roic efforts of Negro ﬁremen,
trainmen and brakemen to pro-
tect their jobs, stand out as one
of the greatest chapters in
American history. Much has

been written about this or that
cowboy hero, but nothing about
these brave men who built the
railroads, and upon whose backs

the riches of our country were
established.

In the non-operating crafts
such as Pullman porters, dining
car waiters and red caps—al-
most exclusively Negro, Negroes
founded their own unions. Ne-
gro ﬁremen and trainmen,
barred from membership in the
major unions, were forced, as a
matter of self-protection, to es-
tablish their own unions. The
Railway Labor Executives Com-
mittee, composed of the Asso-

ciation of Colored Railway &-

Locomotive Firemen, Colored
Trainmen of America, Dining
Car & Food Workers Union, and
the Southern Association of Col-
ored Railway Trainmen & Fire-
men, came into being and for
many years helped to coordi-
nate their work.

Despite great odds, these Ne-
gro unions succeeded in win-
ning contracts and making some
gains. In a limited number of
cases, there was some coopera-
tion between the Negro and
white unions as white workers
began to recognize the toll ex-
acted by surrender to race-
dividing, White—supremacist tac-
tics. But such was not the gen-
eral pattern.

Time and again these Negro
workmen were forced to face
violence and terror because the
railroads had succeeded in pit-

15

ting Negro against white. In one
strike alone on the Cincinnati,
New Orleans, Texas and Paciﬁc
Railroad in 1911 ten Negro and
white ﬁremen died. Negro ﬁre-
men were kidnapped and
ﬂogged. As late as 1933 Frank
Kincaid, a Negro ﬁreman on the
“Creole,” a crack train, had his
head blown off as the crews
changed at Canton, Mississippi.
A few days later another Negro
ﬁreman, Ed Cole, got down
from his cab on the same divi-
sion to throw a switch at the
Water Valley, Mississippi, junc-

 

tion. He got a full charge of
buckshot in his side. Another
Negro Victim ;Of the railroads’
greed. .

From their ranks came men
like A. Philip Randolph and Mil-
ton P. Webster, who gave lead-
ership to the ﬁght forFEPC in
1941 through the powerful
March on Washington move-
ment. Webster was a member
of the ﬁrst and second FEP
Committees.

Theirs is a glorious tale of
the ﬁght for democracy and ﬁrst

class citizenship in our country.

TODAY'S PROBLEMS FACE ALL

Today the entire trade union
movement is under attack. Pres-
ent or proposed restrictive leg-
islation is a threat to every un-
ion. Organized labor is in deep
battle to maintain and improve
working conditions. At this criti-
cal time, labor urgently needs
the support of all sections of the
population, including the 16
million Negro people. The rail-
road unions today simply can-
not afford to brush aside the
overall sympathy which millions
of Negroes feel for, and are pre-
pared to extend to, labor unions
which practice democratic poli-
cies.

Government: Guilty As A
Tool of The Railroads

The railroad industry is a
public institution subject to pub-
lic control. The railroads admit-
ted this when they fought for
free public lands and govem-
ment subsidies. They have also
made this claim whenever the
railroad workers prepared to
strike for better conditions.

Our government, and its agen-
cies, has been involved very
deeply in the barriers that have
been set up against Negro work-
ers in the railroad industry.

 

Charles H . Houston

One ﬂagrant example of this
is the record of the National
Railroad Adjustment Board, a
government agency. Ever since
1926 collective bargaining in the
entire industry has been con-
ducted under the provisions of
the Railway Labor Act. The
National Railroad Adjustment
Board, which considers dis-
putes, is composed of only
Brotherhood members and car-
rier representatives. Thus Ne-
groes are barred.

The courts have ruled that in-
dividuals cannot bargain with
the railroads. Not only are Ne-
gro workers and the associations
representing them barred from
representation on the Board.
They are not even permitted to
appear before the Board when

their cases come up.

Equally anti-Negro in char-
acter is the Mediation Board,
which is part of the Railway La-
bor Act machinery. This Board
certiﬁes the bargaining agent
following election among un-
ions in a given craft. It also has
control over the handling of all
grievances and the policing of
contracts.

The late Charles H. Houston,
at the 1949 House of Repre-
sentatives hearings on F EPC,
raised this pertinent question :

“What possible chance does
a Negro have to bring his
complaint before a board
where ﬁfty percent of the
members are taken from
unions whose official policy
is to drive them out of serv-

ice 1”.’

In fact, as one authority, Her-
bert R. Northrup, put it in his
book, “Organized Labor and the
Negro,” the National Mediation
Board’s practices create the im-
pression that the Board “re-
gards collective bargaining in
the train and engine service as
strictly a white man’s affair.”
Northrup further reports that
“any attempt on the part of
Negro ﬁremen or trainmen to
avail themselves of the provi-
sions of the Railway Labor Act
by organizing unions for their
own protection is looked upon as
disruptive and to be avoided.”

For example, on June 8, 1936,
17

  

Dr. William L. Leiserson, then
chairman of the Mediation
Board, advised the all-white
Brotherhood of Engineers and
Firemen to pull out of an elec-
tion for bargaining agent be-
cause the Negro workers were
a majority on that line and might
inﬂuence the outcome of the
election.

Again, to quote Northrup,
whose opinion many others
share:

“. . . Because of the serious in-
justices suffered by Negroes by
the provisions of the Labor Act,
sound public policy demands
that this law be drastically
amended, rather than serve as
a model for future labor legis-
lation.”

The govemmenfs record has
been equally bad in other in-
stances. During World War I,
faced with an acute labor short-
age when the government took
over the railroads, William
Gibbs McAdoo, railroad coordi-
nator, issued his “equalization of
pay” order. Negro porters who
had been doing brakeman’s work
were classiﬁed as porter-brake-
man, and received brakeman’s
pay. But when the seniority lists
were consolidated, new white
workers were eligible for porter-
brakeman jobs, but Negroes
were barred from the brakeman
classiﬁcation.

After the war, when the rail-
roads were returned to private

18

 

management, and when unem-
ployment increased, Negroes
were “bounced” from the porter-
brakeman Icategory, but they
continued to do brakeman’s
work at porter’s pay. In 1926,
the Railroad Adjustment Board
ruled that “use of porters who
do not hold seniority as brake-
man violates the seniority rights
of brakemen.”

As usual, the railroads raked
in huge proﬁts by getting all
this extra work done at the lower
rate paid to porters. (Braking
is 90 to 95 per cent of the Ne-
gro train porter’s duties.)

This persistent bias on the
part of the government and its
agencies responsible for hand-
ling important questions affect-
ing the working conditions of
Negro workers as well as white
workers obviously demands seri-
ous examination and prompt
modification. As things now
stand, at no level—through the
key unions or the govemment—
are Negro railroad workers per-
mitted representation, voice or
vote. This air-tight exclusion is
not defensible on any ground.
It must be changed.

‘ Fight In Courts Slow Process

Hemmed in from all sides,
Negro railroad workers have

turned to the courts for relief

and redress. Here, too, they have
found little comfort, despite

 

 

many brilliantly presented cases.
As reported by Northrup in “Or-
ganized Labor and the Negro”:

“The courts, however, have not
felt that the exclusion of Ne-
groes from unions alters the sit-
uation. State courts have dis-
missed cases brought by Negro
ﬁremen on the ground that, by
working under a ﬁremen’s un-
ion agreement, they had rati-
ﬁed it, and were bound by its
modiﬁcations; that discrimina-
tion is not shown merely be-
cause one contract is less favor-
able to a group of employees
than a preceding agreement . . . ”
Federal courts refused relief to
Negroes displaced by secret con-
tracts of the same organization
on the ground of no jurisdiction.

Another authority, Dr. D. H.
Mater, revealed that of 57 seni-
ority cases of Negro railroad
men that came before the courts
before 1940 only eight had been
decided in their favor.

Undaunted by earlier court
rulings and by Capitulation of
the federal government to the
railroads, Bester W. Steele con-
tinued to ﬁght. Along with Tom
Tunstall, another Negro railroad
man, and with Houston as coun-
sel, they took their cases to the
courts.

Finally on the historic day of
December 18, 1944, Steele and
Tunstall, latter-day ]ohn Henrys,
struck a hammer blow at jim
crow on the rails when the U. S.
Supreme Court supported their

job ﬁght and ruled that in view
of the existing national non-dis-
criminatory policy, all railroad
contracts were invalid and ille-
gal insofar as they discriminated
against Negroes.

The signiﬁcance of this rul-
ing was that now for the ﬁrst
time the law was on the side of
the democratic job rights of
Negro railroad workers, and rail-
road jim crow was on the de-
fensive. But jim crow does not
die easily.

The arrogant railroad indus-
try ignores the Supreme Court
ruling, with the lily-white unions
tagging along like a caboose.

A court decision alone is not
enough to end job discrimina-
tion on the railroads. The col-
lusive agreements are so wide-
spread that it would take hun-
dreds of court cases and tens of
thousands of dollars to ﬁght
each case through the courts.

Then, too, the court decisions
only conﬁrm the job rights of
Negro workers already employed
on the roads. They do not af-
fect the rights of Negroes to
democratic hiring opportunities
at all levels.

It is clear that a mass cam-
paign must be initiated to im-
plement not just individually,
but on a wide scale, the court
decisions preserving and pro-
tecting job rights of Negroes al-
ready at work, and to win the
ﬁght for democratic hiring.

——J|M cnow PAYS nAn.noAns———

Railroads, the arteries of commerce and
life stream of a great industrial nation, today
employ more than 1,000,000 workers. Their gross
operating revenues exceed 5 billion dollars. In
1951 they boasted a net capitalization of more
than 15 billion dollars. Here is Big Business with
a capital “B”.

The proﬁts they take in are steadily going
up. These proﬁts are based in large part on
government contracts—OUR TAX MONEY. Their
net income has steadily increased since World
War II despite a decline of roughly 30 per cent
in passenger mileage (The government paid out
billions of dollars to the railroads for transport-
ing soldiers and material during the last war.)
But even so these giant corporations take in
many more millions today than during the height
of the global war. There’s gold in those rails.

The total national net railroad income for
the first six months of 1953 was 549 million dol-
lars. This was an increase of 24 per cent over
the ﬁrst six months of 1952. The New York
Central alone reported eight times as much in-
come for the first six months of 1953. The Pennsy
for the same period tripled its income. That’s
not hay, even for billionaires.

No industry holds greater drama in the struggle
of the Negro people. past and present. than does
the railroad industry. It Negro and white trade
unionists and other democratic grou s are willing
to seize upon this history, upon this dllama. we can
present to America the most tar-reaching demo-
cratic jobs campaign ever witnessed in America. We
believe they are ready.

THE FIGHT ON CONTRACT COMPLIANCE

In 1951 President Truman cre-
ated a Committee on Govern-
ment Contracts. This was a sub-
stitute for a real FEP law, de-
signed to take the political heat
off the Democrats for their fail-
ure to carry out their promises
on civil rights. The Truman com-
mittee never functioned. In
August 1953 President Eisen-
hower reorganized the commit-
tee, with Vice-President Nixon
as its chairman. This commit-
tee, which is speciﬁcally charged
with the task of “improving
compliance with the federal gov_
ernment’s fair employment pol-
icy practices in performance of
government contracts,” in more
than a solid year of operation
has failed to discover one single
instance of job jim crow by com-
panies holding government con-
tracts.

Vice-President Nixon has
found time to travel half-wa
a r o u n d t h e world ﬁnding
“threats to our democratic way
of life” at every turn in the
road, but has not found time to
deal with or even to recognize
the brazen and continued de-

20

ﬁance, especially by the rail-
roads, of “government fair em-
ployment policies” right under
his nose.

As long ago as February 24,
1954, and as an initial action in

 

the National Negro Labor Coun-
cil’s campaign for freedom on
the rails, a communication was
addressed to Vice-President Nix-
on, which, following an indict-
ment of the railroads, made the
following demand:

“We would like to call your
attention at this time to a long-
standing, most ﬂagrant and
widespread violation of federal
non-discriminatory requirements
in government contracts, carried
on, without exception, by the
various r a i l r o a d systems
throughout the length and
breadth of the United States. N 0
industry in America draws a
greater revenue from govern-
ment subsidy than do the rail-
roads. And it is a matter of pub-
lic knowledge that no industry
more arrogantly deﬁes all exec-
utive, legislative and judicial
precepts, as well as publicly rec-
ognized moral concepts, of fair
employment practices.

“As the federal agency speciﬁ-
cally formed for this purpose we
urgently request that you im-
mediately launch a full scale in-
vestigation, with open public
hearings, of the discriminatory
hiring and employment practices
of the railroad industry, with
the view of recommending the
withholding of all federal funds
from the railroads until such
time as they live up to the fed-
erally required non-discrimina-
tory clauses in their contracts.”

The President’s Committee
continues to duck the issue.

In addition to the NNLC’s
demand for a general investiga-
tion of railroad job jim crow,
several speciﬁc cases involving
Negro railroad workers have
been ﬁled with the committee.

Clarence Watkins' Fight
To Be A Fireman

One of these cases is that of
Clarence Watkins of Denver,
Colorado, who is currently em-
ployed as a hostler on the Union
Paciﬁc Railroad. For several
years he has been given the run-
around by all responsible parties
in his attempt to win up-grading
to ﬁreman. Watkins’ experience
as a hostler qualiﬁes him for the
10-run training course given to
all ﬁremen. For a year and a
half he was given the run—around
by the union and the company.
He then appealed to the Presi-
dent’s Committee on Contract
Compliance, which is using the
dodge of “no jurisdiction” to
avoid handling his case.

Mr. Watkins has enlisted the
assistance of the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People, as well as the
intervention of Congressman
Adam Clayton Powell.

Here is Mr. Watkins’ story in
his own words:

“I ﬁrst asked for the job of
ﬁreman on the Union Paciﬁc
Railroad in ]uly of 1952, having
been told by the Engineer’s

21

griever that the possibilities of
the application being accepted
were very good. VVhereupon I
asked the District Foreman
about the job. I was told then
that all applications had been
cancelled, only to ﬁnd the next
morning that applications were
still being accepted. I then ap-
proached Mr. R.  Dunn, and
from him I was sent to Mr. Shim-
el, who at that time was out of
town. From Mr. Shimel I was
sent to Mr. Searle, who told me
that he could not do anything
without the “OK” of Mr. Shimel.
I was then referred to Mr. H. T.
Snyder, Master Mechanic, who
was at that time in Kansas City,
as everyone knew except myself.
After a second attempt at se-
curing an application from Mr.
Dunn, I asked if race or color
had anything to do with the re-
fusals of my requests for appli-
cation. After being convinced
that race or color was not the
problem, it was suggested by
him that I get my organization
behind the move.

“Again in ]uly 1953, I asked
for the identical job, and was
told “to write an application”
on a blank piece of paper, and
submit it to the District Fore-
man. Through all my attempts
of securing this application, all
efforts and attempts by me were
being kept a matter of strict
secrecy by the company and the
Brotherhood. My associate and
myself were working alone with
only the help of one member
of the Urban League until the

22

 

appointment of the Government
Contracts Committee.

“In an interview with the Den-
ver Post, Mr. R. L. Baker, Inter-
national Vice Chairman of the
Brotherhood of Firemen and
Enginemen, made this state-
ment: “It is up to the railroads
to promote their personnel. He
can’t get into the union, but
we would have to represent
him.” Mr. A. E. Stoddard of
Omaha, Nebraska, the U. P.s
President, told the Denver Post
“We have a lot of colored per-
sons employed on railroads, but
we have never had anything
like this charged against us.
However, I would like to with-
hold further comment until we
can have this case investigated.
We will investigate it right
away.

“On September 8, 1953, Mr.
R. L. Baker was in Denver to
address a union meeting. After
contacting Mr. Baker, asking
him to address the Brotherhood,
I was kept waiting one hour
and a half to be told that I
could not be entertained be-
cause I was not a member. Later
at the same meeting, the Brother-
hood was assured by Mr. Baker
that I would not be hired as a

.ﬁreman. Also Mr. Baker stated

“The day the Union Paciﬁc hires
a Negro ﬁreman, not a train will
move.” I have an eye witness
who was present and will testi-
fy publicly or privately that this
statement was made by Mr.
Baker.”

 

 

ACTION - NOW !

And so today, in 1954, the Ne-
gro railroad workers face bitter
battles. Before them still lies
the most far-reaching campaign
that has to be waged to win
ﬁrst class citizenship on the eco-
nomic front. Jim crow barriers
must be destroyed in the rail-
road terminals and other places.
Especially must they be smashed
in employment.

VVhat is needed is a positive
program of action supported by
all true believers in democracy,
and particularly by the railroad
Brotherhoods. The National Ne-
gro Labor Council proposes and
will do its share to bring these
demands and steps to life:

1. Demand on companies of
the hiring, training and promo-
tion of Negro railroad workers
in all categories on all railroads.

2. Unqualiﬁed admission of
Negroes to railroad training
schools.

3. Encouragement of Negro
applicants, both men and wom-
en, to apply for jobs on every
railroad.

4. Democratic demand upon
forthcoming executive boards
and conventions of all railroad
unions to admit Negroes as full
and equal members.

5. Immediate and uncompro-
mising enforcement of the

President’s Contract Compli-
ance order and acceptance of
jurisdictions over railroads.

6. Full support to Clarence
Watkins to get Committee to
hold hearings on his case.

7. N ation-wide public hear-
ings on the employment policies
of railroads to be called prompt-
ly by the Contract Compliance
Committee.

8. Passage of strong national
FEPC legislation with penalties
and enforcement power.

9. Revision of the Railway
Labor Act to insure fair repre-
sentation for Negro railroad
workers.

10. Use and enforcement of
all local FEPC laws in railroad
cases.

11. Full support to Negro rail-
road labor groups in their ﬁght
for justice.

12. Support from all unions,
church, fraternal, community
and other organizations in this
far-reaching jobs campaign.

The struggle of Negro rail-
road men and women for the
right to work has been a sharp
and continuous one for over 50
years. With the scales so heavily
weighted against them, the he-
roic efforts of Negro ﬁremen,
trainmen, brakemen and others

23

to protect their jobs stand out as
one of the great, but unﬁnished,
chapters in American history.
Negro railroad workers have
always demanded just the sim-
ple rights fought for and won
by all other railroad workers.
Theirs is a symbolic struggle to-
day in a nation that preaches de-
mocracy to the world, demand-
ing the role of world leadership
while withholding equality from
one-tenth of its own citizenry.
' Our united efforts can make
it possible for every Negro boy
who plays with an electric train
to be confident that, if he wishes,
he too will have a “fair shake”

at becoming an engineer at the
throttle of a main-line train, or
a conductor walking the aisles;
that his sister can be the worker
selling tickets at Grand Central
Station, and in the railroad sta-
tions in Birmingham, Mobile
and Dallas.

The challenge is before us.
The historic U. S. Supreme Court
decision against school segre-
gation shows what can be
achieved. We can make the
“Freedom Train” roll —faster

and faster—to bring democracy
to the rails.

These things for which we
ﬁght shall be ours.

VERY TIME ]ohn Henry
E swung his mighty ham-
mer, more miles of track
stretched into the wilderness un-
til the rails linked the Atlantic
with the Paciﬁc, and here was
no wilderness anymore. ]ohn
Henry and his hammer could lay

track and ties faster than any
hundred men, and nothing but
death could stop John Henry.
He died with his hammer in his
hand.

So goes the great workingclass
legend of John Henry—the Paul
Bunyan of the railroads.

But today the grandsons and
granddaughters of John Henry
have a rough time trying to get
work on the roads built by the

mighty man and his hammer.
John Henry was a Negro.

It is no accident that the leg-
endary hero of the great “era of
railroad expansion was a Negro
worker, for it was largely the
Negro working people, together
with the Irish immigrants who
perfonned the tremendous job of
constructing the vast network
of rails that physically united
this country.

The tremendous job per-
formed by the Negro people as

pioneers in the true sense of

the word is ‘largely ignored or
hidden in the history books.
But there is no hiding or ig-
noring the brutal jim crow set-
up on railroad jobs today. And
no plan for Negro freedom by
’63 can be complete without
spelling out the program for
victory over railroad jim crow.
That was why the ﬁght to run

- jim crow off the rails was a key-

note issue at the 1953 Conven-
tion of the Negro Labor Council
in Chicago and why NLC Exec-
utive Secretary Coleman Young
declared: “No industry holds
greater drama in the struggle of
the Negro people than does the
railroad industry.”

RAILROADS ARE coma ABACKWARDS

While America moves for-
ward against jim crow, the rail-
ways are moving backwards.

Jim Crow in its crudest form
prevails on the nation’s railroads,
North and South. Nine out of
ten Negro railroad workers are
in common labor and service
categories—as waiters, gang la-
borers, car cleaners, pullman
porters, cooks, red caps, bag-
gagemen.

Negroes are ﬂagrantly ex-
cluded from jobs like telegra-
pher, dispatcher, ticket agent,
and other ofﬁce personnel. There
are no Negro conductors, no
Negro engineers, and only a
handful of Negro roundhouse
and maintenance men. Negro

4

women are almost 100% excluded
from railroad employment.

But it wasn't always so

For many decades, the heri-
tage of John Henry was a strong
one, and tens of thousands of
Negro workers contributed to the

‘running of the nation’s railroads

in almost every phase of these
operations.

Employment of Negro work-
ers by the roads was not due to
any democratic instincts among
the railroad monopolies. On the
contrary, the railroads hired Ne-
gro workers in the decades after
the Civil War because the Negro
worker was forced into a posi-

tion where he could be exploited
as “cheap labor.” V

Until World War I, it was
usual for the railroads to use
Negro ﬁremen and trainmen on
many of their southern and bor-
der runs, always being careful
not to promote them to the en-
gineer or conductor categories.
The companies were even more
careful to keep the wages of the
Negro workers down, and by
doing so to drag the level of
all railroad workers—Negro and
white—in the South and in the
border areas down.

This was the wedge that the
men who made millions in the
railroad industry painstakingly
drove between the Negro and
white workers, la yin g the
groundwork for the trap of white
supremacy into which the
railroad brotherhoods h a v e
tumbled.

The corporations used every
weapon at their command—from
subtle racist propaganda to out-

right Ku Klux Klan terrorism to
prevent unity of all workers on
the railroads. In this way, the
companies were able to use the
prejudices and animosities they
fanned to make the railroad
unions — the Brotherhoods — as
instruments to drive the Negroes
off the roads or into the labor
and service categories. just how
completely the railroad brother-
hoods were infected with the
poison of white supremacy can
be best illustrated by the story
of the World War II FEPC hear-
ings, when the companies and
the unions actually teamed up
to thwart the efforts of the
Negro people and of liberal
forces to bring democracy to
the rails. This happened at a
time when the nation was en-
gaged in a worldwide struggle
against Nazi racism, and when
unions in many other industries
were making a tremendous ﬁght
to wipe out the American version
of this racism in industry.

THE FEPC STORY

During World War II the
nation suffered a critical man-
power shortage. ]oseph East-
man, director of the Office of
Defense Transportation, pro-
posed as a solution the use of
women workers, Mexican work-
ers and war prisoners. He did
not recommend the obvious solu-
tion, democratic hiring of Negro
workers, many of them fully

qualiﬁed by experience for rail-
road jobs.

However, the democratic tide
was too strong for this to be
the last word. Recognizing the
crucial need of the nation to
rally everyone to the defeat of
fascism, President Roosevelt in
1941 issued Executive Order
8802, establishing an FEPC. Al-
though this was a step forward,

5

IJv)Juo\D.I.)~).)o.p:...

this first FEPC did not provide
the necessary enforcement pro-
visions.

It was not surprising that mil-
itant Negro railroaders, faced
with the prospect of being driv-
en completely out of the indus-
try by the combination of the
proﬁt-hungry operators and the
jim crow brotherhoods, should

turn to the F EPC for help.

In 1943, hearings scheduled
for the railroad industry were
suddenly postponed “indefinite-
ly” by War Manpower Commis-
sioner McNutt. These hearings
had been in preparation for more
than a year, with a veteran
ﬁghter for equality, the late
Charles H. Houston as one of
the special counsel.

Liberal, labor and minority
groups vigorously protested Mc-
Nutt’s action. Scores of delega-
tions of Negroes and their allies
went to Washington to protest.
Meanwhile, the FEP Commit-
tee established by Executive
Order 8802 died. Houston re-
signed from the Committee and
wrote to President Roosevelt:

_“It may be for the present
that due to disenfranchisement
in the South, the Negro by
himself cannot muster as
much political pressure on the
government as the railroad in-
dustry and the railroad unions.
But if the government thinks
it has purchased domestic
peace and has satisﬁed reac-
tionaries by this surrender of

 

principles, it has forgotten the
lesson of history, including
Chamberlain at Munich.”

New Committee Set Up.
Railroad Hearinas Held

The struggle for job rights of
the Negro people mounted. War
Manpower Commission chair-
man McNutt was forced to de-
clare that the railroad hearings
would be rescheduled. President
Roosevelt then issued another
FEPC order (Executive Order
9346) establishing a new Com-
mittee under the chairmanship
of Monsignor Haas.

The people had won the sec-
ond round.

Discrimination on the rail-
roads constituted the most diffi-
cult and crucial problem facing
the Committee. Hearings in the

matter had been postponed three A

times and their scheduling had
been the ﬁrst Committee’s un-
doing. In the camp of the rail-
roads were powerful ﬁnancial
and political interests, strongly
organized labor unions, and in-
ﬂuential southern forces. The
battle was joined on September
15, 1943. The hearings opened
in Washington, with 22 railroads
and 14 unions as defendants.
They were attended daily by an
audience of more than 400
persons.

Bartley Crum, chief counsel,
referred to the hearings as “un-
doubtedly the most important
ever held so far as minority
groups are concerned, either in

this country or abroad.” Crum
added that the hearings were
needed because “the denial by
the railroads of equal job oppor-
tunities to Negroes and other
minority groups stultiﬁes our
moral leadership of the democ-
racies, provides strong material
for Axis propaganda against us,
and is seriously hampering our
effective prosecution of the
war.” The elimination of Negro
ﬁremen was being carried out,
he asserted, by means of the
Southeastern Carriers" Confer-
ence Agreement (Washington
Agreement), executed on Feb-
ruary 18, 1941. The agreement
had been reached under the
aegis of an agency ofthe United

States government, the Railway .

Mediation Board, as the culmi-
nation of negotiations involving
the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen and Enginemen and a
number of southern railroads.
Other Negro railroad workers
discriminated against w e r e
brakemen, ﬂagmen, baggagemen
and yardmen.

An outstanding and historic
case presented at the hearings
was that of Bester W. Steele.
This ﬁreman on the Louisville &
Nashville Railroad had been il-
legally squeezed out of his job
as a result of the Washington
Agreement. Steele had ﬁrst pe-
titioned the Brotherhood of L0-
comotive Firemen and Engin-
eers. When the union refused to
bring his case before the Rail-
way Adjustment Board, this
ﬁghting Negro railroad worker

7

took his case as an individual to
the newly-created FEPC. Along
with Steele, scores of Negro rail-
road workers testified at the
FEPC hearings. Included among
them were men having twenty
or more years’ seniority who had
been driven from their jobs.
The unions boycotted the
hearings. Sidney S. Alderman,
the companies’ lawyer, brazen-
ly a d m i tt e d discrimination
against Negroes. The arrogance
of the railroads was so great that
at one point in the proceedings
the railroad lawyers even pro-
posed that all witnesses be dis-
missed “since the railroads were
not denying the prevalence of
discrimination.” Alderman de-

8

clared that the railroads had to
abide by the white supremacy

practices
served.
This company lawyer further
argued that the jim crow agree-
ment had been concocted “by
processes under the Railway La-
bor Act and earlier controlling
United States labor laws, often
with governmental assistance
and approval.” In all this he was
unfortunately “dead right.”

Committee Issues Directive

On December 1, 1943 the
FEPC released to the public its
directive to the 20 railroads and
seven unions, ordering them to

-7.-.»~- .‘—.y.m.-.,.n~vyy«7, - V--7-V""""

 

cease their discriminatory prac-
tices and to advise the Commit-
tee “within 30 days . . . the steps
taken or efforts made to com-
ply” with the directive. Ten of
the carriers and one union were
directed to set aside the South-
eastern Carriers’ Conference
Agreement as a violation of the
executive order. The unions cited
in the directives were accused
of maintaining a policy which
“discriminates against Negroes
because of race, in regard to
membership, thus rendering it
impossible (for said Negro
workers) to have any adequate
voice or representation with re-
spect to grievances and the ne-
gotiation of agreements affect-
ing working conditions, employ-
ment policy, practices and op-
portunities.” They were directed
to “cease and desist” from “dis-
criminatory practices affecting
the employment of Negroes.”
Both carriers and unions were
advised that in the event they
refused to comply with the di-
rectives, the matter would be
referred to the President.

Railroads Defy Government
And President

The railroads ﬂatly rejected
the government order, calling it
interference with the existing
collective bargaining contracts.
They declared: “your committee
is wholly without constitutional
and legal jurisdiction and power
to make and issue the directives
which it made and issued, and

for this reason the said direc-
tives are without legal effect.”

In spite of the arrogance of
the railroads, however, the peo-
ple had won a victory, includ-
ing, among other things:

1. The railroads did not suc-
ceed in killing the Committee.
Rather, a stronger second Com-
mittee emerged.

2. The hearings were held and
the directives were issued and,
for the ﬁrst time, a government
agency in the form of the Com-
mittee stood on the side of those
discriminated against, and had
the backing of a strong Presi-
dent

3. Some of the railroads, in-
cluding the Union Paciﬁc, the
Pennsylvania and the New York
Central, expressed a willingness
to cooperate with the Committee
in correcting the abuses of which
they had been accused.

Subsequent to this matters of A

discrimination were dealt with
successfully by the Committee
in the Philadelphia Rapid Tran-
sit case and in the railway and
street car cases in Los Angeles
and Chicago.

Thus for an all too brief peri-
od, the government, impelled by
the worldwide struggle against
fascism and its racist basis, was
cast in‘ the role of a ﬁghter
against jim crow. A closer look
at the history of Negro employ-
ment on the railroads shows that
it was an unaccustomed role for
the federal authorities.
