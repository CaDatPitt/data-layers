MAIN LINK IN EXECUTION
OF CORRECT POLICY

Every Party member must now understand that it depends
on correct policy and above all, the execution of the correct
policy whether we will be able to mobilize the masses of
workers for struggle and whether our Party, in this historic-
ally favorable situation will become the decisive mass Pafty
of the American proletariat, or whether the bourgeoisie with
the help of its social-fascist and fascist agents will succeed
in disorganizing the mass movement and keeping it down.
Never before was the situation in the country so favorable
for the development of the Communist Party into a real
revolutionary mass Party. But from this it follows also
that failure of the Party to understand its chief task —
namely, to become rooted in the decisive industrial centers.
in the important big factories—never before represented
such great danger for the fulﬁlment of our revolutionary
tasks as a whole.

Why is it that the Party adopts ‘resolutions such as were
adopted at the XIV Plenum of the Central Comrmittee, and
does not carry them out? Why is it that we do not learn
from our experiences and mistakes in strikes, trade union
and factory work, and from our work among the part-time
workers and unemployed? Why is it that the leading bodies
of the Party do not concentrate the full forces of the Party
to help the comrades in a practical way in their difﬁcult
but most important Party work, namely, work in big fac-
tories, enabling them to overcome all the diﬂiculties in this
work? Why is it that the entire Party, from top to bottom,
is not working to determine the best ways and means for
establishing contacts with the most important sections of
the workers, learning to overcome their prejudices, speak a
language they understand and persistently and patiently
help them to organize the struggle against hunger? Why is
it that the Communist fractions in the revolutionary unions

' do not make a concrete investigation of the weaknesses in

10

the work of the revolutionary trade unions in order to over-
come these weaknesses?

ESTABLISH SOLID BASE AMONGST DECISIVE ELEMENTS
OF AMERICAN PROLETARIAT

Because in the Party, and particularly among the leading
cadres, there is a deep-going lack of political understanding of
the necessity for strengthening our basis among the decisive
sections of the American workers. From this follows the
fact that the leadership of the Party has not adhered to a
ﬁxed course for overcoming the main weaknesses of the
Party, allows itself to be driven by events, and does not
work out carefully with the comrades of the lower organiza-
tions ways and means for the carrying through of resolu-
-tions and checking up on their execution. The result is
that we talk about factory and trade union work in countless
resolutions, without carrying this work out.

It is time that the entire Party should understand that
Without a solid basis among the decisive elements of the
American workers, the Party cannot lead the revolutionary
struggles of the working class and free them from the
inﬂuence of the social democrats and the bourgeoisie, which
still prevails among the decisive elements of the working
class, however favorable the conditions for our inﬂuence
may be. It is idle chatter to talk about the revolutionizing
of the working class by the Party unless the Party conquers
a ﬁrm basis for itself among the miners, metal and steel
workers, railroad workers, auto, marine and textile workers.
It is idle chatter to speak about the leading role ‘of the
Party without establishing contacts with the decisive strata
of the workers, mobilizing these workers and winning them
over to our side. Talk about the defense of the Soviet Union
and struggle against imperialist war is nothing but empty
phrases unless. systematic work is carried out in the war
industry plants and in the ports; talk of struggle against
social fascism is nothing but empty phrases unless the strug-
gle is carried ongfrom day to day in the big factories, in the

11

but phrase-mongering to speak about building up the Party

and the revolutionary trade unions Without doing this among ‘
the important bodies of workers, in the big factories, in «

the important industrial sections. It is idle to talk about
the necessity of new cadres without developing themlfrom
among these very sections of workers. ’

The working class will be in a position to fulﬁl its role
as the most decisive class in the struggle against ﬁnance
capital, as the leader of all toiling masses, only if it is
headed by a Communist Party which is closely bound up
‘With the decisive strata of the workers. But a Communist
Party, with a very weak and inadequately functioning organ-
ization in the big factories and among the decisive sections
of the American industrial workers, a Communist Party
whose entire policy, whose entire agitation and propaganda,
whose entire daily work is not concentrated on winning over
and mobilizing these workers and winning of the factories,
.a Communist Party which, through its revolutionary trade
union work, does not build highways to the broadest masses
-of workers, cannot lay claim to a policy capable of making
‘it the leader of the working class within the shortest possible
time.

The necessary concentration of our work on the most
important factories does not, of course, in any way mean
that we should allow our work among the unemployed to
slacken. In carrying out this main task we should not for
an instant lose sight of the fact that we represent the inter-
ests of the entire class, and that, especially under the pres-
ent conditions the unemployed constitute a factor of greatest
revolutionary importance. One of the chief tasks of the
Party is the organizing and mobilizing of the millions of
unemployed for immediate relief and unemployment insur-
:ance and the linking up of their struggles with the strug-
gles of the workers in the big factories—full-time, as well
as part-time workers——especially now, in view of the intro-

12

 

reformist unions and among the unemployed. It is nothing ”

 
 

 
 

0- ‘duction of militarized forced labor for the unemployed and

the increased attempts to bring them under reformist and
fascist inﬂuence. But the Party cannot carry out this task

successfully unless at the same time it establishes its base ,

in the decisive big factories. Hunger marches and other

activities of the unemployed must be accompanied by sympa-

thetic actions on the part of the Workers in the‘ factories,
while the actions of the workers in the factories must recieve

V the most active support from the unemployed.

ALLIES OF THE AMERICAN WORKING CLASS-—-THE
HEGEMONY OF THE PROLETARIAT

The fact that great masses of the petty bourgeoisie and
particularly poor and ruined farmers are getting into action,
the right sectarian failure to understand such movements,
as expressed in the stand of leading comrades against par-
ticipation in the veterans’ movement, and the opportunist
tendencies to succumb to the inﬂuence of petty bourgeois
views (the report of a C. C. member about the activity of
a Party organization in the Pittsburgh coal district in con-
nection With the preparation of the struggle of the miners
for April 1st: “They forgot 10,000 miners who are ready
to struggle. In order not to offend the feelings of the
business people, they forgot about the militancy of the min-
ers”)—al1 these factors make it urgently necessary for the
Party to take a clear stand with regard to the allies of the
proletariat in order to win these allies and to protect itself
against errors and deviations. ~

The most important allies of the American working class
are the poor and small farmers. These farmers, as well as
broad sections of the middle farmers, are hardest hit by the
whole development of post-war capitalism and especially by
the economic crisis and are most brutally exploited by the
government, by the banks, by the trusts and the insurance
companies. Their interests are consequently directed ob-
jectively against ﬁnance capital.

13

 
  

  
   

 
   

 
  

 

 

 

In this situation the main task of the Party in its work
among these toilers consists above all in the organization of
the agricultural workers. independently of the farmer, in
organizing them into the Party and trade unions, in organ-
izing and leading strikes of the agricultural workers, which
in many places already played an important role in the de-
velopment of the farmers’ movement. At the same time the
Party has the possibility of mobilizing not only the poor and
small farmers, but also broad sections of ruined middle
farmers, for the struggle against capitalism on the side of
the proletariat, while at the same time it can neutralize
other sections of middle farmers. ‘The winning over [of
broad masses of farmers as allies of the working class is an
important prerequisite for a successful struggle against the
offensive of capitalism, against fascism and for the defense
of the Soviet Union, and ﬁnally for the victory of the pro-
letariat.

The other important ally of the American proletariat is
to be found in the masses of Negroes in the struggle against
national oppression. The Communist Party, as the revolu-
tionary party of the proletariat, as the only party which is
courageously and resolutely carrying on a struggle against
the national oppression of the Negroes, which is becoming
particularly intense with the developing crisis, as shown by

“the recent death sentence against the Scottsboro Negroes

—can win over the great masses of Negroes as allies of the
proletariat against the American bourgeoisie.

The Party can stand at the head of the national revolu-
tionary struggle of the Negro masses against American im-
perialism only if it energetically carries through the deci-
sions of the XIV Plenum of the Central Committee
on Work among Negroes. The Party must mobilize the
masses for the struggle for equal rights of the Negroes and
for the right of self-determination for the Negroes in the
Black Belt. It must ruthlessly combat any form of white
chauvinism and Jim-Crow practices. It must not only in

14

 

 

 

 

 

words, but in deeds overcome all obstacles to the drawing
in of the best elements of the. Negro proletariat, who in the

‘recent years have shown themselves to be self-sacriﬁcing

ﬁghters in the struggle against capital. In View of this,
special attention must be given to the promotion of Negro
proletariats to leading work in the Party organizations. In
all mass actions, strikes and unemployed struggles the Party
must pay particular attention that in formulating practical
demands, it takes into consideration and gives expression to
the special forms of exploitation, oppression and denial of

the rights of the employed and unemployed Negro masses. '

At the same time the Party and in the ﬁrst place the Negro
comrades must genuinely improve the methods of patient,
systematic but persistent struggle against the ideology and
inﬂuence of petty bourgeois nationalists among the Negro
workers and toiling Negro masses.

It is possible also to win over to the side of the workers,
or at least to neutralize broad sections of the lower petty
bourgeoisie and intellectual workers in the cities who have
been brought into action as a result of the tremendous pres-
sure of the crisis (employees, lower officials, teachers, in-
tellectuals, students, petty bourgeois war invalids), if only
the Party will come out resolutely in defense of their inter-
ests (teachers’ strikes, students’ demonstrations, resistance
to reduction of salaries of employees, to robbery through
inﬂation and bank crashes, etc.).

But the one way for the proletariat to secure and maintain
its hegemony is for it to prove in all struggles that it is the
vanguard, the leader, that strikes most courageously against
the common enemy, namely ﬁnance capital. There is no
other way to win hegemony. An absolutely necessary but
auxiliary means toward this end is the winning of the in-
ﬂuence of the proletariat on the non-proletarian sections
through revolutionary work of the Party among these strata.
It is the task of the Party to organize all toiling masses who
have been brought into action against ﬁnance capital and

15

I

its government, into a broad revolutionary political army,
in which the" proletariat is the leading class, and the broad
masses of the petty bourgeoisie in the towns and in the rural
districts are its allies in the struggle against the bourgeoisie.
To ignore this task means objectively to impede the prole-
tariat in the winning of reserves and thus make it easier
for the bourgeoisie to recruit fascist gangs from among the
petty bourgeois elements and to isolate the proletariat. '

But'the more widespread the movement among the non-
proletarian masses becomes and more acute the task of 'win-
ning allies of the proletariat becomes, the more intensely
must the Party work to extend and organize its proletarian
basis. This very extension of the movements of the non-
proletarian masses makes it incumbent on the Party not to
allow itself to be sidetracked from its main task, namely, the
winning of the inﬂuence in the factories, above all in the
big factories, and the systematic building up of factory nuclei
and trade union organizations.

If the Party intensiﬁes its activity among the petty-bour-
geois masses without at the same time and above all strength-
ening its basis in the big factories and among the most im-
portant sections of the American working class, but this
base even having become Weaker—as expressed in such facts
as the leaving of the majority of the strikes to the leader-
ship of the reformists, the‘ decline of -the factory nuclei, the
unfavorable development of the revolutionary trade unions,
and the decline of circulation of the Daily Worker—the'n the
danger arises that the Party, having only weak contacts
with the decisive section of American workers, will be driven
away from its proletarian base, and instead of leading the
petty bourgeois masses will succumb to the inﬂuence of petty
bourgeois sentiments, illusions and petty bourgeois methods of
Work. The root of this danger lies in the sum total of ob-
jective conditions created by the crisis, and in the relation-
ship of class forces.

In spite of the rapid revolutionary advance, the work of

16

  

 

  
    

the revolutionary party, as well as the class consciousness
of the American proletariat, is still weak, while at the same
A, .. time the movement among the farmers and the movement
-51‘. f among the petty bourgeois elements are rapidly spreading.
5_ r; g If the Party does not further make a turn to the work in
V‘ the large factories, and does not organize strike movements
and movements of the unemployed, if it does not strengthen
 its proletarian base and build up the revolutionary trade
ﬂ union movement, then the danger exists that the Party,
‘ ' under the elemental pressure of the petty bourgeois masses,
especially the masses of farmers, will be switched to the
wrong track, in the direction of a Farmer-Labor Party. The
Farmers’ Conference in Washington was, in spite of its mis-
takes, a great success, and marked the beginning of serious
work among the farmers, which must be carried out most
energetically, but in a more correct and improved way.
But the Party must now bend all its efforts to carry out the
Work among the industrial workers in such a way that the
Party will make decisive headway among the industrial
workers, and thus make impossible all danger of the Party
going 01? its proletarian base.

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE PARTY
The Party is now faced with the task of organizing the
united struggle of the American workers and all toiling
masses for their vital immediate demands. This includes:

1. The organizing of struggle: against direct wage cuts and
the reduction of real wages through inﬂation, for increase of
Wages, against every form of the stagger plan, for a reduction ‘i ‘M ,
of working hours with no reduction in pay. 

2. Closely linked up with the mobilization against the wage
cut offensive is the campaign for the organizing of the strug-
gle of the unemployed and part-time workers for immediate
relief, and the organization of the struggle for Unemployment
and Social Insurance at the expense of the government and the

employers. Of the greatest importance at the present time

17

is the task of developing a broad struggle against forced
labor and the militarization of the unemployed, in the press,
through meetings, demonstrations, strikes, raising the slogans:
“For the abolition of all forms of forced labor”; “Against
the militarization of the unemployed”; demanding “trade v . 1“
union rates upon all public works” and organizing especially r ;- V
within the labor camps and among the workers on public
works, the struggle for these demands and for their grievances.

3. For the cancellation of debts on mortgages, taxes and
rents of the great masses of farmers; for the abolition of the
slavish exploitation of the share croppers. . J

4. The organization of the struggle against the reduction 
of veterans’ disability allowances and for the payment of the
bonus.

5. For equal rights and resistance to all forms of oppression
of the Negroes and for the right of self-determination for t
the Black Belt.

6. Struggle against all forms of terrorism, denial of freedom
to strike, speech, press, and against all forms of persecution
and deportation of foreign born workers.

7. Against German fascism and for the release of all prole-
tarian political prisoners.

8. Struggle against a new imperialist war and intervention 4
against the Soviet Union and against ﬁnancial and military
support of Japanese imperialism.

‘The campaign and the mobilization of the workers for
‘ the struggle on behalf of these demands must be carried out
by all Party organizations, above all by the factory nuclei.
 The factory must form the center of our Party and trade . .
union Work in carrying on this struggle. All leading Party
bodies must ﬁrst of all set themselves the task of concretiz- 
ing these demands in accordance with the conditions in the
particular factories, sections and districts.
% ’ p The organizing of the struggles of the working class for
‘ these demands must be carried out on the basis of the united

18

 

 

front in which the Party must always have the initiative.
The united front tactic consists in organizing and mobilizing
the workers, regardless of Party or trade union aﬂiliation,
religion orvcolor, for common struggle in behalf of their
most immediate and urgent demands. In the factories and
trade unions and among the unemployed we must help the
workers formulate their demands concretely and effectively,
really adapting them to the immediate demands of the
workers. These demands must servge to develop their soli-
darity and class-consciousness, and bring the broadest masses
of workers into action.

The systematic application of the united front inthe big
factories is of decisive signiﬁcance in the question of lead-
ing strikes, the establishment of a united ﬁghting front, and
in tearing down of the barriers between therevolutionary
workers and the masses of other workers. The decisive
factor in carrying out this united front is tireless revolu-
tionary everyday work among the workers, in order to prove
in every question the correctness of our slogans and our
proposals for action.

Such systematic day to day work in the factories is the
necessary condition for all serious preparation of strikes
and for the launching of strikes at the proper moment. The
workers will have conﬁdence in us as strike leaders only if
they see that we take every necessary step for the careful
preparation of strikes, selecting the proper moment for the
declaration of the strike, ﬁrmly welding the united front
of all workers before and during the struggle through ﬁght-
ing organs based on proletarian democracy, and if they see
that we mobilize all moral and material assistance for the
strikers, and know enough to call a strike oif at the proper
moment if the mass of strikers are not able to carry the
struggle further. There must be no repetition of such cases
as those in Warren, Kentucky and Allentown, when after
the strike was lost the Party and the revolutionary trade

"This Extraordinary Conference and the Open Letter are l
designed to rouse all of our resources, all of the forces of
the Party to change this situation, and to give us guarantees
that the essential change in our work will be made. The
letter represents the most serious judgment of the situation
and tasks of our Party and our leadership.”——(From Com-
rade Browder’s report at the Extraordinary Party Con-

ference) .

What to do With the Open Letter

THE Open Letter of the Extraordinary Party Conference
is addressed to yow—the Party membership. It outlines
in the clearest manner the situation existing in our Party
today. It points out the necessary steps that must be taken
by the entire Party, by the entire membership, by every
leading committee, if we are to become the mass Party of
the American working class. It is a letter which should

arouse the whole membership to a realization that only the r: 
most determined, persistent and organized activity will a‘

l
()

enable us _to carry through the tasks outlined in the im-
mediate period before us.

The present unsatisfactory Work of our Party requires
the most self-critical examination of thefwork of our entire
Party membership, of every unit of the Party, of every
fraction in the mass organizations, of every leading‘ com-
mittee, on the basis of which immediate steps should be taken
to guarantee the rallying of every member for the carrying
out of the tasks laid down.

You should read this letter carefully——study every line.
Apply the critical examination it makes of the work of the
entire Party to your own Work, to the work of your unit, to

2

   
   

  

\

conditions in the preparation and leading of strikes that
strikes will serve to strengthen our position among the
masses of workers, that the conﬁdence of the workers in us
will be ﬁrmly established, and the readiness of the masses
for further struggles will be increased.

The united front tactic must not be limited to special cam-
paigns or activities which We abandon because We have not
succeeded at once in winning over the workers for struggle,
in convincing them, and because they do not at once want to
separate themselves from the reformist leaders. The united
front must also not lead to the subordination of the revolu-
tionary policy to that of the reformist leaders in the name
of a so-called “united front.” The united front demands
uninterrupted patient convincing work to destroy the in-
ﬂuence of the reformists and the bourgeoisie. The rejection
of the united front proposals of our Party for the imme-
diate urgent demands of the workers by the reformist lead-
ers must impel us to make even stronger'eﬂ"0rts to organize
a common ﬁghting front in the factories, mines and among
the unemployed masses, with the Workers who are under
the‘ inﬂuence of the reformists. The Party must in the
everyday work clarify the workers, in a popular and con-
crete way, on the principle difference between us and the
reformists. The Party must prove to the workers by its
practical Work that we are the vanguard ﬁghters for a
united struggle and that the reformists are the splitters and
disrupters of the struggle.

PERSISTENT STRUGGLE AGAINST SECTARIANISM

In order to get the Party now ﬁrmly rooted among the-

decisive elements of the American workers, itmust in all
seriousness carry out the concentration on special factories,
districts and sections. The center of gravity of _Party work
must be shifted to the development of the lower organiza-

.20

p unions left the workers to themselves and failed to carry 
on'any work whatsoever. It is only by adhering to all these

   

-.

- - ll" .‘-T .-.-a:.

 

 
 

tions, the factory nuclei, local organizations and street nuc-

lei. ‘ It goes without saying that it is our task to place our-
selves at the head of every movement which breaks out
spontaneously in the country, and to lead such movements,
or where the reformist leaders stand at the head of a move-
ment, to work for the building of ﬁghting organs of the
masses, independent of the bureaucrats, in order to aid the
masses in the exposure and replacement of the reformist
leaders. But unless we tenaciously concentrate our work on
the most important industrial centers, we cannot build up a
stable Party and revolutionary trade union movement, cap-

able of resisting all blows and persecutions by the bourgeoisie.‘

The German Communists offer us the best example of this.
It is only because the Communist Party of Germany is
closely linked up with the decisive sections of the German
proletariat that it is able to carry on its struggle against
German fascism uninterruptedly, in spite of brutal fascist
terror.

The Party is confronted with the task of drawing in the
young workers in the class struggle. ‘This demands that an
end be made to the underestimation of youth work, and of
the ,,necessity of putting up special youth demands. All
Party organizations, especially the factory nuclei as well as
the fractions in all trade unions and mass organizations must
organize youth sections and give active support to the Young
Communist Eeague. Every Party factory nucleus must help
to organize a nucleus of the Y. C. L.

In order to effectively carry out this turn to the decisive
sections of the American workers, it is necessary to carry

 on a persistent struggle against the sectarianism which ex-

presses itself in all Party and trade union Work, which con-
tinues to be one of the chief obstacles to the establishment
of ﬁrm and live contacts with the decisive masses of work-
ers. This sectarianism expressed itself above all in the lack
4!-§“f understanding of the necessity of the Party and its lead-

21

 

 

 

 

ing organs for carrying through the turn to mass revolu- ‘‘

tionary work, to develop broad revolutionary unions and
unemployed organizations and to build the basis of the
Party in the most decisive industries. This sectarianism
can be overcome only if the Party carries on a continuous

struggle against the main danger, namely Right opportunism

as Well as opportunism clothed in “left” phrases.

In the present situation, when the American working class
stands before great tasks, any attempt at factionalism would
be the greatest crime before the Party and revolutionary
movement, and would only help our enemies in their strug-
gle to destroy the Party. The Party must Watch closely that,
firstly, no factional opposition is developed against the lead-
ing organs of the Party, and secondly, that not a single
Party functionary, whether he be in the leading organs or
in the lower organizations, misuses his position to carry on
factional methods of work. If such manifestations appear,
the leading organs of the Party and all organizations must
decisively combat and liquidate every such factional attempt,
not shrinking before the removal of incurable factionalists
from the Party. It is only by vigorously preventing all
forms of unprincipled factional struggle, and by energetical-
ly liquidating all factional methods of work, above all by
really developing collective leadership from top to bottom,
that the Party will be able to make the necessary turn to the
decisive strata of the working class and develop the proletar-
ian mass struggle. But it must be absolutely clear that

 

positive criticism and practical proposals, and comradely,

material exchange of political opinions, for improving the
work of the Party are a vital necessity for the Party and
that all bureaucratic tendencies to interfere with such criti-
cism and proposals, all bureaucratic intolerance :of criticism,
must be decisively fought.

At the same time the Party must carry on a systematic
struggle against the bureaucratic isolation of the apparatus
from the Party masses, against the suppression of inner

T Party democracy, for the development of political life in the

lower organizations, particularly in the factory nuclei, for
the development of thorough-going self-criticism, for the
development of initiative in the lower organizations and for
the improvement of its functioning cadres. Every Party
member, and especially every Party functionary, must be a
real organizer of mass struggles in his particular sphere
of work. From this standpoint, the Party must judge the
activity of its functionaries and must choose its leading
bodies. All leading bodies, especially those in the sections,
must reorganize their work on the basis of the carrying out
of revolutionary mass work. Revolutionary work is the task
of the entire membership. The secretaries of the leading
bodies in their work must not replace the work of the mem-
bership. It is their task to plan and organize the Work to-
gether with the members, to give the members practical
assistance in carrying out their tasks and to check up on the
carrying out of these tasks. As delegates to all Party con-
ferences, section and district conferences and above all to
the Party congress, there must be elected comrades who
carry on active mass work and who have distinguished
themselves in mass struggles.

Comrades: The Party has approved the estimation of the
international situation given by the XII Plenum of
the Comintern, stating that we are approaching a new round
of wars and revolutions. It is time that we should draw
from this declaration the practical conclusions for our ac-

tivity. The development of mass struggles depends to a,‘

great extent upon the speed with which we succeed in draw-
ing the industrial proletariat into the struggle and in be-
coming the revolutionary mass Party of the American work-
ing class.

Is it possible to carry out such a twrn in our work?; Of
course, it is possible. The members of the Party have shown
in countless activities, in strikes, in hunger marches, demon-
strations and in painstaking day-to-day work, that they are

practical measures must be adopted in order to guarantee _

and carry out /the turn in the Party. _ \
The discussion of this letter must not take ‘place merely-in
a general way. Eirery nucleus, every organization, every

Party fraction must link this disdussion up with concrete M

tasks, working out ways and means how to bring about im-
mediately a real turn in the entire work of each individual
organization, for the carrying out of this turn. The leading

organs of the Party are responsible _’_co -the membership, the

' Communist work in the factories, among the unemployed, in

the mass organizations.

Discuss this letter in your unit, in your fraction, in your
section and district committee. But discussion is not enough.
Discussion will establish that political clarity necessary to
transform this letter into the weapon with which to hew
out the road to the most decisive sections of the American
proletariat—in the ﬁrst place to those in the big factories.
What is needed now is work—carrying out in deeds the words
of the letter. The Central Committee and the comrades
gathered at the Extraordinary Party Conference know that

every member is involved in the work, see that every mem-
ber carries out his Communist task. Forward your resolution
to the Daily Worker as soon as the membership of your unit,
or fraction, section or leading committee has adopted it.
Make the resolution a means of controlling all decisions,
guaranteeing that every decision of the leading committee,
of your fraction, and unit is carried out. Forward to rooting

letariat, among the Negro and white masses.

Open Letter to All Party Members

Party Comrades:
The tremendous sharpening of the economic crisis, and

the new severe attacks of the bourgeoisie on the workers _

and toiling masses, as Well as the feverish preparations of
the imperialists for wars among themselves and for interven-
tion against the Soviet Union, make a rapid tum of the
Party to revolutionary mass Work among the decisive sec-
tions of the American industrial proletariat an imperative
task.

The rise of the strike movement, the mass action of the
unemployed, the increasing opposition within the A. F’. of L.
‘against the bureaucracy, the various movements Which are
growing at a tempestuous pace among the poor farmers and
ruined middle farmers, the movements among the masses of
petty bourgeoisie in the cities and the toiling intelligentsia,
especially among the teachers, students and intellectuals-
all these factors indicate that the revolutionary upsurge is
gaining momentum. But in spite of the spread of the mass
movements, and, above all, in spite of the radicalization
of the masses of workers, the Party has not developed into
a revolutionary mass Party of the proletariat, even though
it can point to a number of achievements in its Work, such as
in the Detroit strike, in the Hunger Marches, in the veterans’
movement and in the Farmers’ Conference.

DEVELOPING THE PARTY INTO A MASS
PROLETARIAN PARTY

In many resolutions we already set ourselves the task of
developing our Party into a proletarian? mass Party. We
did this with the greatest thoroughness over a year ago at
the XIV Plenum of the Central Committee. But all these
resolutions have for the most part remained on paper. The
leading organs of our Party have not succeeded in mobilizing
the masses of members for a systematic and determined ap-

4

 

 

  

pplication of these resolutions or in .giving the Party mem-‘

bership practical assistance in putting these resolutions
into force. At the XV and XVI Plenums, the leading organs
of the Party did not call themselves ruthlessly topaccount for

the failure of the Party to make any headway in the car-

rying out of this turn.

What did we decide at the XIV Plenum? At this Plenum
we declared that we are still isolated from the main masses

L, of the American industrial workers; that We still have no
; ﬁrm contacts with these sections of Workers, and that we

 

 

are not keeping pace with the general revolutionary advance.
In order to overcome this situation We set ourselves the fol-
lowing tasks:

1. The organization of a ﬁrm basis for our Party and the
revolutionary trade union movement among the decisive
strata of the American workers in the most important in-
dustrial centers;

2. The consolidation and strengthening of the revolutionary
trade unions, especially revolutionary unions of the miners,
steel and metal, textile and marine Workers, and systematic
work in the reformist trade unions, above all among the
reformist unions of miners and railroad Workers, with a
view to organizing a broad revolutionary trade union op-
position;

3. The organization and mobilization of the millions of
unemployed, together with the factory workers, for their
most urgent needs ‘and the organization of the struggle for
unemployment insurance as the central immediate struggle
of the Party; V

4. The transformation of the Daily Worker into a really
revolutionary mass paper, into an agitator and organizer of
our work;

5. The wide development of new cadres of workers; the
establishment of really collectively-working leading bodies of
our movement and the improvement of the work of these

leading bodies by the drawing in of new capable working class
elements.

In order to carry out these tasks, we worked out a con-
centration plan and pledged ourselves to transfer the center

of our work to a number of selected most important large 1

factories, sub—districts and districts. The entire work of the
Party and the best forces of the Party were to be directed

ﬁrst of all to building up and consolidating the Party and 1,

revolutionary trade union movement in the most important
industrial centers of the country, to effectively and system-
atically win the decisive sections of the American workers,
free them from the inﬂuence of the reformist and bourgeois
parties, mobilize for the struggle against the bourgeoisie,
and get our inﬂuence solidly established in these centers.

But these tasks have not been carried out. Only 4% of the
membership are organized in factory nuclei, and only a small
portion of these are organized in nuclei in big factories. The
Communists have neglected and worked badly in the revolu-
tionary trade unions, and consequently the chief red trade
unions, such as the unions of the coal miners, the steel and

metal workers, the textile and marine workers, have not

gone forward, but have stagnated. The work in the reform-
ist trade unions has in general been neglected by the Com-
munists, which particularly led -to the fact that the “left”
reformists (Muste) were able to bring many radicalized
Workers, especially American Workers, under their inﬂuence
(Southern Illinois), and that the inﬂuence of the reformists
has extended also to some elements of unorganized workers.
The circulation of the Daily Worker has fallen off.

In spite of the fact that there have been widespread move-
ments among the workers and many workers have come
forward in the struggles, the cadres of functionaries of the
Party have not been rejuvenated and strengthened from the
ranks of these workers, and sectarian elements, who are
beyond hope of improvement and have lost touch with the

masses, have not been replaced by new worker cadres who
have distinguished themselves in struggle.
The clearest expression of the failure to carry out this

concentration is the fact that during the past year the-

majority of strikes were led by reformists, while we made
no serious attempt to get the leadership of these struggles
away from them, thus abandoning militant workers to the
disorganizing and disrupting activities of the reformists.
More than that even. .In fact the reformists in Eastern

2 .Ohio, a concentration district of the Party, succeeded in
‘h J taking over the leadership of miners who had previously

carried on a heroic strike under the leadership of the Nation-
al Miners Union. This was possible only because the Central
Committee and local leading bodies of the Party failed in
an inexcusable manner to devote suﬁicient attention to this
movement of one of the most important sections of workers,
and consequently did not realize the militancy existing among
the miners. .

The success of the Party and of the Automobile Workers
Union in Detroit shows what can be accomplished by the
Party and the revolutionary trade unions in other districts

when they vigorously defend the interests of the workers and .

carry out the principles of concentration in the proper way.
We did not devote our full energy to the campaign for un-
employment and social insurance——a. campaign offering the
possibilities of welding the employed, part-time and un-
employed workers together in the struggle against the
bourgeoisie and in a number of localities allowed the initia-
tive to be snatched from our hands (Cleveland, etc.). We
underestimated and neglected the struggle against social-
fascism, and did'not link it up with the daily revolutionary
Work in the factories and trade unions, as well as among
the unemployed. We did not take the trouble to answer
carefully all the arguments of the social-fascists. All of
which constitute one of the chief reasons for a growth of
the inﬂuence of the reformists, especially “left” reformists
among the workers. 7

PARTY LEADERSHIP ‘BEARS FULL RESPONSIB/ILI'I'Y V
This situation in our work, for which the whole Party

leadership bea/rs full responsibility, makes it the iron revolu-

tionary duty of the Party to carry out a decisive turn in our
work in a most speedy way, in view of the tremendously
rapid development of the crisis and the growing revolu-
tionary advance.

Owing to the changes in the administration, the American
bourgeoisie was in a position to spread among broad masses
of workers temporary illusions of an approaching improve-
ment in their situation. But the depth and tempo of the
economic crisis have established favorable conditions for
a speedy unmasking of the policy of the parties of the bour-
geoisie. Roosevelt is continuing Hoover’s policy against the
working class and other laboring masses in an intensiﬁed
form, ushering in his term with bitter attacks (inﬂation,
reduction of salaries of government employees, reduction in
veterans’ allowances, ‘the Allotment Plan, forced labor and
militarization of unemployed workers, the sales tax, etc.).

The radicalized workers who had their bitter experience
with the Republicans, are now well on the way to meeting
with the same experience from the second traditional party
of ﬁnance capital, namely, the Democrats, and‘the movements
among the workers against robber measures are bound to
increase. The poor farmers and the ruined middle farmers
who only yesterday voted for the bourgeois parties are, in
fact, already taking the path of struggle against the policy
carried on by these parties, and are constantly intensifying
their efforts to attain an “independent” policy. Thus, as a
result of the development of the crisis, which is character-
ized not only by a rapid extension of the labor movement,
but also by a widespread movement among the petty bour-
geoisie, we ﬁnd a far-reaching mass movement of workers,
farmers and other middle elements which is directed against
the old bourgeois parties, and against the government, and
which is growing continually stronger.

The American bourgeoisie, which fears a development of
‘great class struggles and clashes, is already making attempts
to block this development. It is no mere chance that the
Socialist Party, with the calling of the so-called Continental

 

Congress, is developing the greatest activity they have shown A

for years, that the Musteites are intensifying to a very mark-
ed degree their activity especially among the American sec-
tions of the working class, and that at the same time efforts.
and tendencies are coming to light in the direction of organ-
izing a Farmer Labor Party, and that various reformist,
fascist and semi-fascist organizations among the unemployed
farmers, etc. are springing up all over the country. On the
one hand the bourgeoisie is attempting With the help of
the reformists to establish all kinds of rallying centers for
intercepting the disillusioned masses, and to set up barriers
against Communism. On the other hand, and at the same
time the bourgeoisie is intensifying direct terrorism and
provocation against the masses and coming more and more
to adopt fascist methods of violence and demagogy and to
establish fascist organizations.

The reformists and especially the Musteites are attempting
in the most active manner to paralyze the inﬂuence of the
Communists by their own activity, which is directed also
toward the organization of a Farmer Labor Party. As op-
posed to our policy, namely: alliance of the proletariat with

M the poor farmers and ruined middle farmers under the

 

hegemony of the proletariat and struggle for the revolution-
ary way out of the crisis,—-they are putting forward their

policy, namely: a policy which goes in the direction of

establishing a Farmer-Labor Party, in which the Workers

become an appendage to the petty bourgeoisie and the petty-

 

bourgeoisie ‘become an appendage -to the bourgeoisie, and
for “democratic” methods of struggle.
