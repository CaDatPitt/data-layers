In discussing the evidence my arguments are, of course,‘ subject
to correction by you as to the facts. Your memory-is quite clear'}
on these considerations on the facts and the evidence, and in In
argument 1 am only relying on my own memory, as refreshed
by reference to the minutes. i ’ ~

The Real Issues

It is my belief that the real issues in this case have been ob
scured by a mask of irrelevant or trivial details, that in orde‘
to find the real issues we must first of all understand what:

There is no charge that l have in any way secured rights that pl ,
am not entitled to, that any persons have been_ injured by, any
action of mine, nor has it been shown that any damage ha i‘
ﬂowed, directly or indirectly, from the acts upon which the two.
counts of the indictment are -predicated. I am on trial for havin
entered the port of New York with myown passport under;m ‘ ‘
own name in the full light of the publicity of the New York,»
press, of the newspaper reporters present, photographers. ﬂashing,
their bulbs and taking pictures, crowds gathered to see every dye"
tail of that entry. This is thecrime. In so far as the eviden
presented upon the indictment places the issues, in so far as t e,
issues are not to be inferred from the situation in the ‘world and
in this country outside of this courtroom, outside of the evidence?
presented here, such issues must: be explicitly delimited.
11

  

   

 ’ié_._b;é1sic ones are: are there any facts or circumstances con‘-’
ected with the entry ‘described in the evidence when ‘I came‘
I nto the port of New York on.April 30, 1937, and on Feb-
ry.15, 1938, with my own passport in my own name——is there
evidence which can transform those two entirely normal and
tter‘ot fact events into‘ crimes against the peace and dignity of
United States? That is the sole issue. If at any time in our
ment it should seem’ to you that I am relying upon techni-
ies, «I. ask you to remember that the prosecution itself has
ented a case compounded of technicalities. It is a thin web
 technicalities, and everything of seeming substance in the case
‘n ists of matter which on its own merits would beiexcluded
L, m consideration, but is brought’ in only on technicalities, and
g facing atechnical prosecution it is necessary to make a tech-
nical. defense as well as a substantive one of law and evidence.
Just to remind you from the language of the indictment itself
ha -thispis the so1e'issue—the two entries—-the indictment says in
‘counts, “did use and attempt to use Passport No.” so and
1 ;i“in- the nameiof Earl Russell Browder.” «
L The second count in the indictment says, “did use and attempt
Q;;_use this passport for the purpose of gaining and securing ad»
fission into the ‘United States; against the peace of the United
tates and theirdignityand contrary to the form of the statute."
Now let us review the facts of those entries. That is the starting

’ jpdays from the evidence presented here, or any evidence
could be presented. j_ a
w if this basic proposition is established, that there can be
_ ime inferred from or «predicated upon the act of entry of a
tizen into this country, then the whole indictment and the evi-
 presented upon it falls; and that fact could be proved by
ti g a thousand legal decisions, it could be proven by citing
, _ everyday evidence of men who go in and _out of’ United
_.tates territory, by ﬁshermen who go out beyond the three-milé
‘tto ﬁshand come back. They don't have to have any special
 to re-enter. It can be proven by pleasure boats going in
_ _ out. No papers are necessary. They leave and enter the ter-
' "ry of the United States, and every one of such acts of leaving
 entering is of exactly the same legal signiﬁcance as leaving
61 ‘entering with’ an ocean liner from Europe.
f this is established, no further argument is necessary. The
vs dict of acquittal must automatically follow. If that proposi-
"niis rejected, if it is maintained that there are circumstances
tinder whichea citizen could be excluded, could be exiled from
hi country, then it becomes necessary to follow up our argument
further to the next link in the chain of evidence, a long, com-
/pigicated, ﬂimsy thing, upon which the Government relies to link
i,937.and 1938 with events in the past, in many instances the dim
past; '
This next ‘link, when we go behind events of the two entries
(rged in" the indictment, is the document displayed A upon

oitfissued in 1934 that was presented. in 1937 and 1938? The
secution has insisted that it was. But the prosecution itself
hia given the evidence that it was not. The evidence shows icon-
ciusiyely-that the passport issued in 1934, issued to me in my ‘own
name, ‘had become null and void, had expired, its validity had

rom,’.’ although the phrase cited is not a question, and even if it
were a question, the word “None” is not an answer to it. as it
stands in any event. As the prosecution contends, this meaning-
lessl series of words is susceptible of the meaning that it is a state-
rnenat. that the defendant had Beyer before had any passport, that
itgwas therefore false, and that such falsity induced the issuance
of the passport.‘ .

' If in your consideration of the case you must go as far back
the 1934 applicationfbecause you have rejected the other con-
siderations, you will then be ‘faced with the decision in judging
he 1934 application—whether that word “None” was a statement
gwhether it was false, and whether such falsity induced the issu-
ance of the passport. The indictment, and the prosecution in pre-
senting itscase, had studiedly, systematically omitted all references
-to the fact that the phrase “My last passport was obtained from”
wasronlyihalf a sentence..The other half was the phrase "and is
submitted herewith for cancellation.” It is highly signiﬁcant that
the rosecution suppressed the other half of the sentence in the in-
‘dictment, has studiedly om‘itted reference to it in the presentation
of the ‘evidence. Why? The prosecution must have felt that a
"full citation of the sentence would weaken or even destroy the
case; and that is the fact. When half presented, as in the indict-
"ment, that sentence is either meaningless or false. You can take

ourchoicc. But you have noother. Meaningless or false. But
whsenthe whole sentence‘ is presented, you have,three choices-
tneaningless, false or true. It is impossible -to construe it as true
when only half the sentence is cited, and that is why the prosecu-
ion" cited only half of the sentence. But when the whole sen-
'f}tence is cited it is possible to construe it as a true statement and

Vi/tions. when you cite the whole sentence, the interpretation that
the answer .“None” meant “I do not have any present passport
Vito present for cancellation as I have destroyed it," that is the
ffpossible interpretation when you take it in the contexv of the
full sentence. That interpretation is excluded from your con-
sideration when you are given only part of‘ the sentence.

The Proof

Mn. BROWDER: I was referring to the testimony of the Govern-
nt's expert/witness, Bell, who, having no knowledge of this
e or any particular facts concerning this case, did have knowl-
edge of some circumstances concerning events which followed
the acts charged in the indictment, which he placed into the rec-
ord on the questioning of the prosecution. We were not able to
" rig out these things in their full implications because of ob-

The Question of Prejudice

MR. BROWDER: I am not referring to the statute of limitations.
Jsithas been ruled upon by the Court; I am referring to the fact

A before the jury from being considered by the jury and weighed
' to whether it is a crime or not, because any -imputation of 1:
ime is excluded by the statute of limitations. That crime is not
ing tried here, and it is within my province to argue against
ny prejudice that might have arisen in the jury on this count.

‘ Iam directing, myself against prejudice in the jury that might
ise from these matters. Therefore it is permissible for me to
note that the statute of limitations is not operating in my favor
"a  that I am claiming no privileges that the statute of limita-
tions, in so far as it operates, is _in the public interest and is gen-
erally understood that its strict application is in the public in-
terest, and that this ‘statute establishes that upon its expiration.
«what may have been crimes are to be treated as having .been

onger a crime, that it is the same as if an absolute and u'ncon~
ditional pardon had been granted.

T g you are not trying me for the Dozenberg, _Morris or Richards

‘ ports, nor for the 1934 application, nor for the 1930 pass-

tr Allgof those things are excluded from any charge that is

iii e against me.\ I have already cited the facts established in the
dence of the Government's witnesses. These things were known

o the ‘Government. And in weighing the seriousness of these
mgs, you can take into account that the Government for ten
first did not‘ consider them serious enough to act upon. If you

this case has been upon a level, and of such‘ a nature

Court, from all this it would be possible to conclude upon
face of it that this is a frivolous one, belated and delayed, w.
out substance, incredible and unprecedentedly thin. I say,  V
faceof it, it could be so understood. Upon its face the Govern
ment’s case can be best described by a quotation from Lineup

gRooseve|+ Drives Towards War

Since last summer, the powers that bé have been preparing
their drive against the Communist Party, and we have been warn-

A ing that this was only the opening gun of the drive against the
 whole labormovement and against American democracy. Up
a z until last summer this drive was being carried on outside the

igjfthe ﬁrst place against the New Deal Administration. Since last
 August, a great change has come about. The drive is carried on
g ,1 through the Administration because the New Deal lamb has lain

«down with the reactionary lion. Unity has been achieved. The
. _ lamb has been eaten and the lion stands now in the robes of the
Administration carrying out the policies of a generally united
a American bourgeoisie—united on the program to scrap the pro-
gressive social legislation of the New Deal, to revise the budget

We-election. He will not deny it. He is a God-fearing man. He
would not lie about it. He would not deny he had long intimate
conferences with Communists as to how best to conduct his cam-
‘paign for governor. But he lost his election by 2 per centiof the
vote. We were not able to win the election for him. And he was
a hero only for one campaign. After he was defeated, he saw a
great light. He became convinced he had made a great mistake
wheni he had failed ‘to heed the advice of some of our “best fam-
lilies." He demonstrated he had learned ‘his lesson and would be a
W good boy thereafter. And there was opened up the prospect for him
.. to retire to the most exclusive old men's club of America. But
 before he could do that, he had to present certain guarantees.
V W .Heahad ‘to present some “head on a charger" according to the
V ancient tradition. He had to seal his bargain, metaphorically
‘speaking, with the blood of the associates who had tainted his
pi past. That is one of the smaller angles to the sentence in the
‘ - Federal District Court today. '

‘ Well, we never wasted anv time weeping about those who have
deserted from the ﬁght, ar/d surrendered to the enemy and -en-
,tered into their service. _As a matter of fact, we never had many
> ‘illusions about these people. We had read our Marx and Lenin
‘and had understood that while sections of the petty bourgeoisie
 and some of the bourgeoisie may occupy progressive positions in
certain historic moments—and when they do, we join forces with
.them for that moment against the reactionaries—we knew it is
‘ in the very nature of these class forces that they cannot follow
‘a consistent position from one year to another, for any long
period, and rarely can occupy a consistent position from month
 to month except when they are solidiﬁed and led by their most
I reactionary section.

The Threa+ +0. American Labor_

V And that is what is taking place today. The trial today is the
opening gun in a great campaign to curb and harness the labor
 movement. It belongs along with the campaign to scrap and ham-
ffstring the National Labor Relations Board, along with the war
and hunger budget in Congress, and along with the campaign

the workers, of the great masters of the science of history,’which~_
is the science of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin. Yes, these tem 
porary associates of ours in the democratic progressive blocshad
gathered rather tentatively around progressive New Deal’ meas-..
ures for a certain historical period. These former associates of,
ours don't need us any more.~_What use are we to them now?
When they were ﬁghting for social betterment, well, they not only?

They are not making that kind of speeches and they don't want
to rouse the masses. In the days when they did want to rousef
the masses, we had the peculiar experience with them that we-:_
had to restrain them’. They were ultra-leftists, and very often we
had to warn them that that kind of tactics is.not good—you, had:
better lay off of it. We were ‘a sobering and restraining ‘inﬂuences
upon them. Just as now they need a sobering and restraining
inﬂuence from another direction. ' ' _ .< i

That instability arises out of the very class nature .of theswi
people; constantly torn by contradictions, they have ‘interests.
here and interests there, and they cannot be reconciled. The‘
daughter-in-law may be married to a munitions family and there A"
is a contradiction to it if we have a peace policy. Another mem-:9
ber of the family may have entered the employ of their once
greatest political rival. These contradictions have to be recon
ciled some way and the family and national unity have to be re-
established some way, and how can it be done? ‘ ~
