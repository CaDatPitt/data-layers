O The ballot: The ﬁght of the
Negro people in the South to
vote. . ‘

O The unions: The growing
trade union organization in the
South and the growing unity
between white and Negro work-
ers.

The powerful economic and po-
litical rulers of the South fear
these developments more than
they would the plague. The reign
of terror _. . . the rise of the Ku
Klux Klan . . . the lynchings . . .
the open _appeals to bigotry and
white supremacy hatred . . . these
are the poisonous fruits of the
fear of the growing democracy by
the Southern ruling group.

The desperation of those who
seek to resist progress was made
even greater by the vast upheaval
of public sentiment brought on by
the inhuman murder of Emmett
Till. Throughout the nation, peo-
ple responded:

C In New York City, 20,000
people attended a protest rally
in the garment district. . . .

O In Detroit, a mass meeting
was attended by 15,000 people
who contributed $14,000 to the
NAACP to S prosecute the

case. . .

C In Chicago 100,000 people
viewed the body of young Em-
mett Till. . . .

11

C A public meeting under the
local NAACP took place on
September 25, 1955 in Dothan,
Alabama, to hear a speaker on
the Emmett Till case. . .

Tremendous democratic forces
have been turned loose. . . . This
is why the Southern rulers——who
have never accepted the Emanci-
pation :Proclamation—are letting
loose their hooded riders and
lynch brutality. . . .

THE JOB AHEAD

“The Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation,” Dr. Howard told his
Baltimore audience, “with all of
its knowledge, with all its power,
can never work out who the killer
is when a colored person in the
South is the victim. . . .”

“Something is wrong some-
where,” continued Dr. Howard,
“and I believe that there is enough
wrong that the President of the
United States, the Attorney Gen-
eral and J. Edgar Hoover himself,
must be called into a conference
to see why Southern investigators
of the department can neverlsolve
the crime when there’s a black
man involved. . . .”

Similarly, A. Philip Randolph,
president of the Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Porters, which spon-
sored a mass rally in New York
in protest against the acquittal of

 

  

the two white men accused of the
Till slaying, urged upon Attorney
General Herbert Brownell “to or-
der immediately an FBI investiga-
tion. . . . I have information from
a reputable source who attended
the Till murder trial in Sumner,
Mississippi, that there are persons
in Mississippi having information
which would aid the federal au-
thorities materially. . . .” '

“The NAACP would like to in-
quire specifically,’’_ states Roy
Wilkins, NAACP executive secre-
tary, “why the FBI entered the
Dammons case in New York (kid-
napping of white youngster in
New York) one day after disap-
pearance of the boy, and failed to
enter the Till case in Mississip-

pl 99

This demand for federal au-
thorities to move in on the wave
of terror to the South is being ad-
vanced in many quarters.

Congress Must Act

So is support being voiced for
the proposal of a group of liberal
Congressmen who are making
plans to introduce legislation to
reduce the size of the Mississippi
congressional delegation "on
grounds that the state is violating
the U. S. Constitution by refusing
to let Negroes vote.

According to leaders of this
movement in Congress, the 14th
Amendment to the Constitution

12

empowers the nation’s highest leg-
islative body to reduce the dele-
gation of any state which deprives
citizens of the right to vote.

Labor Demands Action
The labor movement —- white

and Negro members alike — are A

growing increasingly aware of
what white southern terror means
to the future of American trade
unions and union conditions.

Segregation . . . bigotry . . .
discrimination . . . terrorism . . .
all add up to disunity among
working people who must have
unity if they are to gain higher
wages, decent working and living
conditions. Especially is'this true
in areas where Negro working
people are a huge numerical sec-
tion of the population.

Runaway shops are another
means of awakening labor to
what southern discrimination
means to working people, Wrote
H. C. Rhodes, mayor of Pala-
hatchie, Miss., to a northern fac-
tory president on June 10, 1954:

‘,‘Greetings. . . . We cordially
invite you to visit our beautiful
community. We want your Corn-
pany to have the harmonious and
highly successful experiences of
operating in a veritable industrial
paradise. . . . We will provide the
site and building as you want
them . . . with taxes being ex-
empted up to 99 years. . . . Our

 

 

wonderful labor, 98 percent na-
tive born . . will lower hourly
industrial wage rates . . . from 50
cents to 95 cents below Northern
states. . . .”

This is the bait for attracting
runaway s-hops . . . lower wages
. . . the result of a policy of dis-
crimination which today is en-
forced by open terror. . . .

When unions seek to organize
in the South today, they are ac-
cused of “mongrelization” and
labor leaders——such as CIO‘ Pres-
ident Walter Reuther-——are labeled
“Negrophile.” '

A headline from Jackson, Miss.,
says of a C10 organizing drive

in the South: “C10 plotting to end
race segregation.”

An anti-union leaflet distributed
in the south states, according
to Murray Kempton, columnist of
the New York Post: “Integration
poses a greater threat to the work-
ing man and woman than any-
thing else. It seems odd that intel-
ligent men and women of the
South would go along with the
CIO mongrelization scheme. . . .”

It is such anti-union smears as
this that caused one local union
in Cleveland to comment: “The
blows that murdered Emmett Till
were also blows to murder every

UE's ‘Program for Action

The 20th UE National Conven-
tion addressed itself in September,
1955 to this burning issue:

“A deadly poison is being pre-
pared for the entire labor move-
ment through the concentrated
practice of pitting black against
white. We characterize this new
drive against the people as
Operation Killer.

“The new reign of terror un-
leashed against the Negro people
in open deﬁance of the Supreme
Court of the United States is a
threat to all future progress. The
rising tide of violence, lynchings
and economic reprisals against
the Negro people, fostered by
powerful economic forces in our
country cannot be escaped by the
labor movement.

“The UE Fair Practices pro-
gram has been a key weapon in
exposing and defeating our ene-
mies in the economic struggles

A REIGN OF TERROR is taking place in the South.
That reign of terror—which is arousing protest from
all decent-minded Americans—is taking place because:
. The United States Supreme Court has ordered an
end to segregation in schools and parks.

C The |.C.C. has ordered an end to segregation on
trains and buses.

. The Negro people—and underprivileged whites-
are demanding the right to vote.

. With industry growing in the South, increasing
unity is taking place between Negro and white
working people.

The reign of terror seeks to head off these developments
. . . to keep the southland undeveloped, undemocratic
and unorganized. . . .

Here is how the terror operates:

 

ON THE NIGHT of May 7, 1955,
the Rev. George W. Lee, a
clergyman of Belzoni, Mississippi,
was shot and killed in his car
after having refused under pres-
sure to take his name off the voter
registration list. His murderers
have not been apprehended. . . .

I‘ ‘I ‘I’

On the morning of August 13,
1955, a 63-year-old election cam-
paign worker—Lamar Smith of
Brookhaven, Mississippi —— was
shot and killed in broad daylight
in front of the courthouse after
having made open efforts to get
out the Negro vote invthe coming
primary election. No indictment
has been returned against the
three suspects arrested for this
crime.

On the night of August 28,
1955, two men kidnapped Em-
mett Till——14 years of age——from
his uncle’s home in Le Flore
County, Mississippi. The boy’s
body was found four days later
in a nearby river. The men who

S III THE

admitted the kidnapping were
tried for murder and acquitted.
Nor were they even indicted for
the kidnapping. . . .

'I <I> I-

These are no isolated crimes.
Nor is Mississippi the only site
of wholesale force and violence
being practiced against the Negro
people.

Throughout the Southland -
and overﬂowing into northern
areas——-a wave of terrorism against
the Negro and white champions
of racial equality is taking place.

Sometimes the newspapers we
read report these crimes against
a people. Sometimes they go un-
reported. But the terror that is
afoot demands the attention of
all who cherish democracy and
our constitutional form of gov-
ernment.

Dr. T. R. M. Howard, a Negro
physician and surgeon from
Mount Bayou, Mississippi, deliv-
ered an address before 2,500 peo-
ple in the Baltimore Sharp Street
church on October 20, 1955,

Stop this slaughter of personal rights. The recent wanton
murder of a boy whose only "crime" was an alleged ado-
lescent gesture toward a woman has climaxed a series of
blows to American ideals that has horrified the country.

which makes clear the situation
confronting our land.

“I’m here to tell you this after-
noon,” the physician who oper-
ates the Friendship Clinic and
Hospital in Mount Bayou, told
his audience, “that the wave of
terror no longer threatens the
South, but the wave of terror is
in. the South. . . .”

“The reason that there is so
much disturbance in Mississippi
today is that the colored people

~ in Mississippi have decided . ,. .

that we don’t want to wait until
we get to Heaven to walk where
we please. We want to do it right
here in this present world. . . .”

“Everytime they get ready to
lynch a person in the South,” Dr.

Howard said, “it’s got to be about

some white woman. I wish you’d
also tell them that the colored
man is satisﬁed with his women,
and my great desire this after-
noon is that the Mississippi white
man would be as satisﬁed with
his own women as I am with
mine. . . .” i

For .having his own thoughts
and speaking out on them, Dr.
Howard’s life today is in danger.
As he told the Baltimore meeting:
“I live dangerously in Missis-
sippi.”

“F or the past six months,” Dr.

Howard reported, “I’ve had two
guards about my home on 24-hour
duty. Not trying to protect me,
but to protect my wife and my
two children.”

“I’ve had guards around my

hospital and I have two other
individuals to go with me wher-
ever I go throughout the State of
Mississippi. I don’t ‘know if this
counts for much, but I want some-
body to know at .least where I
take my last step. . . .”

Democracy ”Subversive!"

In the South oftoday, anyone
who defends our constitutional
government “lives dangerously.”
In the‘ South it is- “subversive”
to defend democracy today.

On October 18, 1955, the At-
torney General of the State of
Georgia accused the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People of being “sub-
versive” because it demands an
end to segregation.

“The NAACP,” said the’ At-
torney General of Georgia, “and
its local fronts pose a serious
threat to the peace, tranquility,
government and way of life of
our states.” The oﬂicial asserted
that the NAACP’s real design is
to “force upon the South the
Communist-inspired doctrine of

In Lake City, South Carolina,
a Negro clergyman, active in the
desegregation movement, had to
ﬂee for his life on October 10,
1955, when he defended himself
and his family with a shot-gun
after his home had been ﬁred on.

The clergyman——the Rev. Io-
seph A. DeLaine———charged that
the Ku Klux ‘Klan has been re-
vived under other organizational
names in the South. He asserts
that “newspapers, television and
radio are being used to recruit
whites against Negroes.”

Speaking in the Bethel AME
church in New York City after
his ﬂight, the Rev. DeLaine stated:
“I shot in Jesus? name. I wanted
to mark that car so there would
be no question about its identity.”

But, despite the fact that the
clergyman’s acts were in defense
of his home and family, and actu-
ally had injured no one,‘a South
Carolina grand jury has indicted
him, and a demand was made
to extradite him from New York
to South Carolina.

In Umatilla, Florida, on Octo-
ber 20, 1955, twelve Negro citrus
workers were wounded by shot:
gun blasts ﬁred into a union or-
ganizational meeting. The attacks

took place without warning while
a white union organizer was ad-
dressing the Negro workers in a
Negro Masonic hall. . . .

On August 18, the Indianola
(Miss.) Enterprise, following the
example of other state newspapers,
printed an editorial addressed:

"TO ALL WHITE MEN AND
WOMEN IN |NDlANOLA"

The editorial urged all local

white citizens to heed the “clarion”

call” to mobilize ‘against the “hu-
miliation of desegregation” or-
dered by a “subversive Supreme
Court.”

In November 1954, Mississippi
enacted a constitutional amend-
ment requiring voters to be able
“to read. and write and interpret
the State Constitution.” This qual-

iﬁcation together with the reign

of terror, is responsible for the

. fact that a mere 8,000 Negroes

register to vote out of a total
Negro population of 986,500.

Why are the ﬂames of discrim-
ination and bigotry being fanned
white heat at this particular time?

What lies behind the terror in
the South?

ORCE AND VIOLENCE in the

South are being practiced
wholesale against the Negro peo-
ple—and white defenders of dem-
ocracy—because the ruling inter-
ests in the South fear the advance
of democracy there. And behind
these ruling interests stand the
big corporations of the North who
want to maintain the South’s low
wage and non-union status.

These economic and political
rulers are determined that the
United States Constitution shall

not prevail . . as far as the
6,000,000 black citizens of the
South are concerned.

These powerful interests prefer
to wreck cherished American lib-
erties and the Constitution itself
rather than grant the Negro peo-
ple their basic rights—the right
of life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.

These forces have blanketed a
state like Mississippi and the en-
tire deep South with a curtain of
darkness—the darkness of fear.
The Negro people fear the deva-
stating reign of terror. White
workers are also victims because
the wave of terror hits viciously
at anyone—regardless of color—
who practices democracy.

The lynching of Emmett Till
may resemble to some a night-
mare. But it is not an evil dream.
It is a reality. . . . It is also a
symbol . . . and a warning.

Why The Terror?
The reign of terror is at hand

because of three major reasons:
0 The children: The United
States Supreme Court decisions
which ordered an end to racial
segregation in the schools.
parks and playgrounds.

WHICH SHALL IT BE? lntensiﬁcation of the ”Jim Crow” system in the
South which aims to keep Negro and white workers separated? Or shall
all of labor demand the breaking down of false barriers between human

beings, regardless of color?
