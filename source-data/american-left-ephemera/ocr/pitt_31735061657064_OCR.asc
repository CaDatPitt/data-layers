MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

These cases present a narrow question with several re-
lated issues. May the Attorney General, as the executive
head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service,‘
after taking into custody active alien communists on war-
rants,’ charging either membership in a group that ad-

was a provision for the deportation of alien anarchists
and other aliens, who are or were members of organiza-
tions devoted to the overthrow by force and violence of
the Government of the United States, but the Internal
Security Act made communist membership alone of aliens
a suﬂicient ground for deportation.” The reasons for the
exercise of power are summarized in Title I of the Inter-
nal Security Act. It is suﬂicient here to print § 2 (15)."
We have no doubt that the doctrines and practices of com-
munism clearly enough teach the use of force to achieve
political control to give constitutional basis, according to
any theory of reasonableness or arbitrariness, for Congress

3° See note 4, supra. The extension of the proscription of residence
to, aliens believing in the overthrow of Government by force or
violence has been progressive as can be readily observed by following
the successive enactments of laws to regulate the residence of aliens
since the Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 874. See 8 U. S. C. §§ 137
and 155. .

*1 “(15) The Communist movement in the United States is an
organization numbering thousands of adherents, rigidly and ruth-
lessly disciplined. Awaiting and seeking to advance a moment when
the United States may be so far extended by foreign engagements,
so far divided in counsel, or so far in industrial or ﬁnancial straits,
that overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and
violence may seem possible of achievement, it seeks converts far and
wide by an extensive system of schooling and indoctrination. Such
preparations by Communist organizations in other countries have
aided in supplanting existing govermnents. The Communist organi-
zation in the United States, pursuing its stated objectives, the recent
successes of Communist methods in other countries, and the nature
and control of the world Communist movement itself, present a clear
and present danger to the security of the United States and to the
existence of free American institutions, and make it necessary that
Congress, in order to provide for the common defense, to preserve
the sovereignty of the United States as an independent nation, and
to guarantee to each State a republican form of government, enact
appropriate legislation recognizing the existence of such world-wide
conspiracy and designed to prevent it from accomplishing its purpose
in the United States.”

to expel known alien communists under its power to regu-
late the exclusion, admission and expulsion of aliens.”
Congress had before it evidence of resident aliens’ leader-
ship in communist domestic activities suﬂicient to furnish
reasonable ground for action against alien resident Com-
munists. The bar against the admission of Communists
cannot be differentiated as a matter of power from that
against anarchists upheld unanimously half a century ago
in the exclusion of Turner.” Since “[i]t is thoroughly es-
tablished that Congress has power to order the deportation
of aliens whose presence in the country it deems hurtful,” 2‘
the fact that petitioners, and respondent Zydok, were
made deportable after entry is immaterial. They are de-
ported for what they are now, not, for what they were.“
Otherwise when an alien once legally became a denizen of
this country he could not be deported for any reason of

which he had not been forewarned at the time of entry.
Mankind is not vouchsafed suﬁicient foresight to justify
requiring a country to permit its continuous occupation in
peace or war by legally admitted aliens, even though they
never violate the laws in effect at their entry. The pro-
tection of citizenship is open to those who qualify for its
privileges. The lack of a clause in the Constitution spe-
ciﬁcally empowering such action has never been held to
render Congress impotent to deal as a sovereign with
resident aliens.”

III. Constitutionalitg/.—A. Arbitrary, capricious, abuse
of discretion.—The power to expel aliens, being essen-
tially a power of the political branches of government, the
legislative and executive, may be exercised entirely
through executive officers, “with such opportunity for
judicial review of their action as Congress may see ﬁt to
authorize or permit.” This power is, of course, subject
to judicial intervention under the “paramount law of the
Constitution.” 2’

Deportation is not a criminal proceeding and has never
been held to be punishment. No jury sits. No judicial
review is allowed.” Since deportation is a particularly
drastic remedy where aliens have become absorbed into
our community life,” Congress has been careful to provide
for full hearing by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service before deportation. Such legislative provision

‘requires that those charged with that responsibility exer-

cise it in a manner consistent with due process.” Deten-
tion is necessarily a part of this deportation procedure.
Otherwise aliens arrested for deportation would have op-
portunities to hurt the United States during the pendency
of deportation proceedings. Of course purpose to injure
could not be imputed generally to all aliens subject to
deportation, so discretion was placed by the 1950 Act in
the Attorney General to detain aliens without bail,_ as set
out in note 5, supra.”

The change in language seems to have originated in
H. R. 10, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., introduced by Mr. Sam
Hobbs of Alabama on January 3, 1949. It was intended
to clarify the procedure in dealing with deportees and
to “expressly authorize the Attorney General, in his dis-
cretion, to hold arrested aliens in custody.” 3’ The need
for clariﬁcation arose from varying interpretations of the

“Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S. 86; Vajtauer v. Commis-
sioner, 273 U. S. 103.

3‘ The former provision read as follows;

“. . . Pending the ﬁnal disposal of the case of any alien so taken into
custody he may be released under a bond in the penalty of not less
than $500 with security approved by the Attorney General, condi-
tioned that such alien shall be produced when required for a hearing
or hearings in regard to the charge upon which he has been taken
into custody, and for deportation if he shall be found to be unlawfully
within the United States.” 8 U. S. C. § 156, 1946 ed.

On December 7, 1951, at the request of this Court, the Government
furnished us a list of the Bail or Detention Status, as of the period just
prior to December 7, of deportation cases, involving subversive
charges, pending on the date of the enactment of the Internal Security
Act, September 23, 1950. The list indicates that the modest bonds
or personal recognizances of the far larger part of the aliens remained
unchanged after the bond amendment to the immigration act. Of
those detained Without bond on order of the Service, the courts have
released all but a few. It is quite clear from the list that detention
without bond has been the exception.

authority to grant bail under the former bail provision.
Note 31, supra. In Prentis V. M anoogian, 16 F. 2d 422,
424, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had
held that by the earlier provision “Congress intended to
grant to the alien a right, and that its failure to follow
with some such phrase as ‘at the discretion of the com-
missioner’ vests the discretion to avail himself of the op-
portunity afforded in the alien, and not the discretion to
allow bail in the commissioner or director.” On the other
hand in United States ex rel. Zapp v. District Director,
120 F. 2d 762, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sec-
ond Circuit construed the provision to the contrary. It
said:

“The natural interpretation of the language used,
that the alien ‘may be released under a bond,’ would
indicate that the release is discretionary with the At-
torney General; and that appears to be borne out
by other provisions of this section, as well as other
sections of the immigration laws, where the choice
of words appears to have signiﬁcance.” P. 765.

In the later case of United States ex rel. Potash v. District ’

Director, 169 F. 2d 747, the same court applied its Zapp
opinion to explain that the Service’s discretion as to bail
was not untrammeled but subject to judicial review.” It

33169 F. 2d at 751:

“The discretion of the Attorney General which we held to exist in the
Zapp case is interpreted as one which is to be reasonably exercised
upon a consideration of such factors, among others, as the probability
of the alien being found deportable, the seriousness of the charge
against him, if proved, the danger to the public safety of his presence
within the community, and the alien’s availability for subsequent
proceedings if enlarged on bail. However, in any consideration of his
denial of bail it should always be borne-in mind that the court's
opinion as to whether the alien should be admitted to bail can only
override that of the Attorney General where the alien makes a clear
and convincing showing that the decision against him was without a
reasonable foundation.” See U. S. ea: rel. Doyle v. District Director,

m_———.—__._. ; 4 -——-—-

 

 

CARLSCN v. LANDON. 15

was in the light of these cases that Congress inserted in
the bail provisions the. phrase “in the discretionof the
Attorney General,” the lack of which very phrase the
M anoogian case held made bail a right of the detained
alien. The present statute does not grant bail as a mat-
ter of right.

The Government does not urge that theAttorney Gen-
eral’s discretion is not subject to any‘ judicial review,
but merely that his discretion can be overturned only on
a showing of clear abuse.“ We proceed on the basis sug-
gested by the Government. It is ﬁrst to be observed
that the language of thereports is emphatic in explain-
ing Congress’ intention to make the Attorney General’s
exercise of discretion presumptively correct and unassail-
able except for abuse. We think the discretion reposed
in the Attorney General is at least as great as that found
by the Second Circuit in the Potash case, supra, to be in
him under the former bail provision. It can only be
overridden where it is clearly shown that it “was without
reasonable foundation.”

The four petitioners in the Carlson case were active in
Communist work. In the Zydolc case the only evidence
is membership in the Party, attendance at closed sessions
and the holding of the office of ﬁnancial secretary of its

U. S. ex rel. De Geronimi v. Shaughnessy, 187 F. 2d 896. (This is the
only case from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals since the Internal
Security Act. It leaves open the question of the reviewability of the
Attorney General’s action under that Act.)

34 The proposed bills at one time contained a provision:

“(f) No alien detained under any provision of law relating to the
exclusion or expulsion of aliens shall, prior to an unreviewable order
discharging him from custody, be released by any court, on bond or
otherwise, except pursuant to the order of a Federal court composed
of three judges.” S. Rep. No. 2239, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3. This
was introduced to allow for possible release from custody pending
deportation hearings. Id., p._ 9. The clause did not survive.

 

16 CARLSON v. LANDON.

Hamtramck Division. This evidence goes beyond un-
explained membership and shows a degree, minor per-
haps in Zydok’s case, of participation in Communist
activities. As the purpose of the Internal Security Act
to deport all alien Communists as a menace to the se-
curity of the United States is established by the Inter-
nal Security Act, itself, Title I, §2, we conclude that
the discretion as to bail in the Attorney General was
certainly broad enough to justify his detention of all these
parties without bail as a menace to the public interest.
As all alien Communists are deportable, like Anarchists,
because of Congress’ understanding of their attitude

toward the use of force and violence in such a constitu- .

tional democracy as ours to accomplish their political
aims, evidence of membership plus personal activity in
supporting and extending the Party’s philosophy concern-
ing violence gives adequate ground for detention. It
cannot be expected that the Government should be re-
quired in addition to show speciﬁc acts of sabotage or
incitement to subversive action. Such an exercise of
discretion is well within that heretofore approved in
Knauﬁ v. Shaughnessy, 338 U. S. 537, 541.35 There is no
evidence or contention that all persons arrested as deport-
able under § 22 of the Internal Security Act, note 4, supra,
for Communist membership are denied bail. In fact, a
report ﬁled with this Court by the Department of Justice
in this case at our request shows allowance of bail in
the large majority of cases. The refusal of bail in these
cases is not arbitrary or capricious or an abuse of power.

35 Even though we also take into consideration the factor of prob-
able availability for trial, which we do not think is -of great signiﬁcance
in cases involving security from communist activities of alien com-
munists, the past record of these aliens is far from decisive against
the Attorney General’s action. The Internal Security Act made
membership sufficient for deportation and set up a procedure that
could be carried out. §22 (2) (C), note 4, supra, and §23. Depor-
tation became more likely for alien communists by these amendments.

 

 

CARLSON v. LANDON. 17
There is no denial of the due process of the Fifth Amend-

'ment under circumstances where there is reasonable ap-

prehension of hurt from aliens charged with a philosophy
of violence against this Government.

B. Delegation of Legislative Power.-—This leaves for
consideration the constitutionality of this delegation of
authority. We consider ﬁrst the objection to the alleged
unbridled delegation of legislative power in that the At-
torney General is left without standards to determine
when to admit to bail and when to detain. It is familiar
law that in such an examination the entire Act is to be
looked at and the meaning of the words determined by
their surroundings and connections. Congress too can
only legislate so far as is reasonable and practicable, and
must leave to executive oﬂicers the authority to accom-
plish its purpose.“ Congress need not make speciﬁc
standards for each subsidiary executive action in carry-

ing out a policy." The bail provision applies to many

506; Panama Reﬁning Co. V. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 421:

“The Constitution has never been regarded as denying to the Con-
gress the necessary resources of ﬂexibility and practicality, which will
enable it to perform its function in laying down policies and estab-
lishing standards, while leaving to selected instrumentalities the mak-
ing of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determina-
tion of facts to which the policy as declared by the legislature is to
apply.”

Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 424-425:

nated administrative agency, it directs that its statutory command

classes of deportable aliens other than those named in
the classes listed in §22 of the Internal Security Act.
See note 4, supra.“ A wide range of discretion in the
Attorney General as to bail is required to meet the vary-

ing situations arising from the many aliens in this.

country.”

The policy and standards as to what aliens are subject
to deportation are, in general, clear and deﬁnite. 8
U. S. C. §§ 137 and 155. Speciﬁcally when dealing with
alien Communists, as in these cases, the legislative stand-
ard for deportation is deﬁnite. See notes 3 and 4, supra.
In carrying out that policy the Attorney General is not
left with untrammeled discretion as to bail. Courts re-
view his determination. Hearings are had, and he must
justify his refusal of bail by reference to the legislative
scheme to eradicate the evils of Communist activity.
The legislative judgment of evils calling for the 1950
amendments to deportation legislation is set out in the
introductory sections of the Subversive Activities Control
Act.‘° So far as pertinent to these proceedings, the new
legislation was designed to eliminate the subversive ac-
tivities of resident aliens who seek to inculcate the doc-
trine of force and violence into the political philosophy

shall be effective. It is no objection that the determination of facts
and the inferences to be drawn from them in the light of the statutory
standards and declaration of policy call for the exercise of judgment,
and for the formulation of subsidiary administrative policy within the
prescribed statutory framework.”

33 Any alien becoming a public charge within ﬁve years of entry
may be subject to deportation. Likewise any alien sentenced more
than once for any crime involving moral turpitude, and certain illegal
entrants. See 8 U. S. C. §155.

39 Approximately 85,000,000 people, citizens and aliens, are said to
have crossed our borders in the 1949 ﬁscal" year. Some many times.
Five million aliens are reported to have registered under the Alien
Registration Act of 1940. S. Rep. No. 1515, pp. 630-631, supra 11. 22.

‘° See for example § 2 (15), quoted above at note 21.

 

 

CARLSON v. LANDON. 19

of the American people. To this end provision was made
for the detention and deportation of certain noncitizens,
including members of the Communist Party. When in
the judgment of the Attorney General an alien Commu-
nist may so conduct himself pending deportation hearings
as to aid in carrying out the objectives of the world com-
munist movement, that alien may be detained. Compare
Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, _and Bowles V. Will-
ingham, 321 U. S. 503, 515. This is a permissible delega-
tion of legislative power because the executive judgment
is limited by adequate standards. The authority to de-
tain without bail is to be exercised within the framework
of the Subversive Activities Control Act to guard against
Communist activities pending deportation hearings. Cf.
Mahler v. Eby, 264 U. S. 32, 40. We do not see that such
discretion violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment.

C. Violation of Eighth Amendment.-—The contention
is also advanced that the Eighth Amendment to the Con-
stitution, note 9, supra, compels the allowance of bail in a
reasonable amount. We have in the preceding sections of
this opinion set out why this refusal of bail is not an abuse
of power, arbitrary or capricious, and why the delegation
of discretion to the Attorney General is not unconstitu-
tional. Here we meet the argument that the Constitu-
tion requires by the Eighth Amendment, note 9, supra,
the same reasonable bail for alien communists under de-
portation charges as it accords citizens charged with bail-
able criminal offenses. Obviously the cases cited by the
applicants for habeas corpus fail‘ ﬂatly to support this
argument.“ We have found none that do.

Director, 169 F. 2d 747, 752:

20 CARLSON v. LANDON.

The bail clause was lifted with slight changes from the
English Bill of Rights Act." In England that clause has
never been thought to accord a right to bail in all cases,“
but merely to provide that bail shall not be excessive in
"those cases where it is proper to grant bail. When this
clause was carried over into our Bill of Rights, nothing
was said that indicated any different concept.“ The
Eighth Amendment has not prevented’ Congress from de-
ﬁning the classes of cases in which bail shall be allowed
in this country. Thus in criminal cases bail is not com-
pulsory where the punishment may be death.“ Indeed,
the very language of the Amendment fails to say all ar-
rests must be bailable. We think, clearly, here that the

Amendment and any requirement of the due process provisions of
the Fifth Amendment will be fully satisﬁed if the standards of fair-
ness and reasonableness we have set forth regarding the exercise of
discretion by the Attorney General are observed.”

United States ex rel. Klig v. Shaughnessy, 94 F. Supp. 157, 160:

‘‘It is not unappropriate to refer here to the Eighth Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States, one of that series of amend-
ments collectively known as the Bill of Rights, which prohibits the
imposition of excessive bail. Certainly, the principle inherent in
that amendment applies to deportation proceedings, whether or not
such proceedings technically fall within its scope. That principle
cannot be reconciled with the government’s denial of bail to these
relators under the circumstances here set forth.”

Eighth Amendment does not require that bail be allowed
under the circumstances of these cases.

It should be noted that the problem of habeas corpus
after unusual delay in deportation hearings is not involved
in this case. Cf. United States ex rel. Potash v. District
Director, 169 F. 2d 747, 751.

IV. Rearrest.—-Finally, respondent Zydok argues that
his rearrest on the outstanding warrant, after he had once
been released on bail, was improper. The inquiry on
habeas corpus is limited to the propriety of Zydok’s pres-
ent detention. M cNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131, 136.
While the Attorney General has made a satisfactory show-
ing that he has good cause for detaining Zydok without
bail, no order based on a new warrant has been entered.“
Zydok did not allow the proceedings to run along but ob-
jected promptly by habeas corpus to detention under the
warrant. It has been said that the rule in criminal cases
is that a warrant once executed is exhausted." This
guards against precipitate rearrest. Where, however, the
rearrest comes after the discovery of error in release, a
new warrant is not necessarily required.” State cases
have held that an escaped person or one who secured his
release by trick may be rearrested without a new warrant.“
Although a warrant for rearrest is required by statute,
when a convicted person is paroled his status on violation
of the parole is the same as that of an escaped prisoner.“

ersy On Writ of Certiorari

[March 10, 1952.]

MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.

Today the Court holds that law-abiding persons, neither
charged with nor convicted of any crime, can be held in
jail indeﬁnitely, without bail, if a subordinate Washington
bureau agent believes they are members of the Commu-
nist Party, and therefore dangerous to the nation because
of the possibility of their “indoctrination of others.”
Underlying this harsh holding are past decisions of this
Court declaring that Congress may constitutionally direct
the summary deportation of aliens for any reason it sees
ﬁt. I agree with MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS for the reasons
he gives in his dissenting opinions in Nos. 43, 206, and

 

 

2 ‘ CARLSON v. LANDON.

264 that these prior declarations should now be recon-
sidered and rejected. This would dispose of these cases.
But the Court today not only adheres to, but greatly
expands the constitutional doctrine of the former cases.
The Court also relies on the Internal Security Act of
1950, 64 Stat. 987, for its holding. MR. JUSTICE FRANK-
FURTER presents strong arguments for construing the Act
so as to reach an opposite result. But even if authorized
by that Act, as the majority hold, the denial of a right to
bail under the circumstances of these cases strikes me as a
shocking disregard of the following provisions of the Bill
of Rights: Eighth Amendment’s ban against excessive
bail; 1 First Amendment’s ban against abridgment of
thought, speech and press; 2 Fifth Amendment’s ban
against depriving a person of liberty without due proc-
ess of law.'°' Before a detailed discussion of my sev-
eral grounds of dissent it is necessary to state the facts
and the precise issues the records present.

Respondent Zydok, petitioners Carlson and others
were all arrested (“detained”) in connection with pro-
ceedings which might lead to their deportation. A sub-
ordinate of the Commissioner of Immigration, not the
Attorney General, directed that they be held in prison
without bail. Of necessity, consideration of these deporta-
tion proceedings by bureaus and courts may last for years.
Carlson’s has already dragged on for over four years.
Moreover, even deportation orders at the end of such pro-
ceedings might not end their indeterminate jail sentences
since the foreign countries to which they are ordered

might refuse to admit them. Such refusals .have pre-
vented deportation in thousands of cases.‘ Thus denial
of bail may well be the equivalent of a life sentence, at
least for Zydok, 56 years old, and Carlisle whose health
is bad. Such has become the fate of ordinary family peo-

ple selected and classiﬁed, on secret information, as “dan-

gerous” by Washington bureau agents. .
Zydok’s case illustrates what is happening. He has
lived in this country 39 years, owns his home, has violated
no law, is “not likely to engage in any subversive activi-
ties,” has a wife, two sons, a daughter and ﬁve grand-

children, all born in the United States. Both sons served ’

in the armed services in .World War II. Zydok himself,
thena waiter, sold about $50,000 worth of U. S. war bonds
and'“donated blood on seven occasions to the Red Cross
for the United States Army.” This jailing of Zydok,
despite a patriotic record of which many citizens could
well be proud, is typical of what actually happens when
public feelings run high against an unpopular minority.

While the Court gives Zydok a momentary technical
respite, its holding means that he too, pursuant to the
government’s present program, can and will be held in jail
without bond as a “dangerous” character. The others,
with equally enviable records as law-abiding persons, are
not even given a technical’ respite. Mrs. Stevenson is
the wife of a citizen and is the mother of a young man who

' is also a citizen. Her son has long been subject to attacks
of undulantfever. He and his 70-year-old grandmother .

need Mrs. Stevenson’s help as does her husband who does
her housework while she is “detained” as ‘‘dangerous’.’ to
our national security. The District Judge tried to per-
suade the representatives of the Immigration Bureau and
the Attorney General to agree for him to enter an order ﬁx-

ing bail for her and for Mr. Carlisle. His request was
refused. I

The record does not leave us in doubt as to why bail
was denied Mrs. Stevenson, Mr. Carlisle, or any of these
allegedly “dangerous” aliens. Denial was not on the
ground that if released they might try to evade obedience
to possible deportation orders. The District Judge in No.
35 conceded that “there is nothing here to indicate the
Government is fearful that they are going to leave the
jurisdiction”; he said, “I am not going to release men
and women that the Attorney General’s oﬂice says are
security risks”; he also said, “I am not going" to turn these
people loose if they are Communists, any more than I
would turn loose a deadly germ in this community. If
that is my duty, let the Circuit Court say so and assume
the burden.” 5 These remarks to counsel show that he

I kept these people in jail only because he thought Com-

munists, as such, were too dangerous to the nation to be
allowed to associate with other people. The Court of
Appeals’ denial of bail was also based on the premise that
Communists were too dangerous to the nation to be left
out of jail, not on the premise that deportation would
be delayed or frustrated by granting bail. 187 F. 2d 991.
And the Solicitor General has admitted here that “the
only evidence" advanced to support their detention with-
out bail was that they had been active in the Communist
movement!" The majority here also appears to rest on
the same basis. It must, unless it is now‘ drawing in-
ferences that some might ﬂee and be unavailable for de-
portation.‘ As the Government admits, there‘ is not a

“And the District Judge in No. 35 said “When there is a claim,
and I don’t know whether it is true or not . . N. that these people
are security risks and that their release is dangerous to the security

. of the United States, until that is either disproved or proved I am not
going to release them. My first vote in that respect is for the se-
curity of my country. We have had 4200 casualties already.”

 

 

CARLSON_ v. LANDON. 5

vestige of support for such an inference.“ Besides, an
alien “who shall wilfully fail or refuse to present himself
forldeportation . . . shall upon conviction be guilty of V a
felony,‘ and shall be imprisoned not more than ten
years . . . .” 64 Stat. 987, 1010.

Thus it clearly appears that these aliens are held in
jail without, bail for no reason except that “they had
been active in the communist movement.” From this it
is concluded that theirassociation with others would so
imperil the nation’s safety that they must be isolated
from their families and communities. On this premise
they would be just as dangerous whether aliens or citizens,
deportable or not. Since it is not necessary to keep them
in jail to assure their compliance with a deportation order,
their imprisonment can not possibly be intended .as an
aid to deportation. They are kept in jail solely because
a bureau agent thinks that is where Communists should
be. Apower to put in jail because dangerous can not be
derived from_ a power to deport. Consequently. prior
cases holding that Congress has power to deport aliens
provides no support at all for today’s holding that Con-
gress has power to authorize bureau agents to put “dan-
gerous” people in jail without privilege of bail.

The stark fact. is that if Congress can authorize im-
prisonment of “alien communists” because dangerous, it
can authorize imprisonment of citizen “communists” on

the same ground. And while this particular bureau cam-

paign to ﬁll the jails is said to be aimed at “dangerous”
alien communists only, peaceful citizens may be ensnared

6 In this state of the record and particularly in view of the Solicitor
General’s contrary admission, I am at a loss to understand note 35
in the Court’s opinion. It is there intimated that these aliens might
ﬂee and be unavailable for deportation. I cannot believe that the
Court is resting, or -would rest, its approval of’ denial of bail on a
ground which even the Solicitor General had not deemed supportable
by the record. - .

in the ‘process. For the bureau agent is not required to

. prove that a person he throws in jail is an alien, or a com-
munist, or “dangerous.” The agent need only declare he.

has reason to believe that-such is the case. The agent may
be, and here apparently was acting on the rankest hearsay
evidence. The secret sources of his" “information” may
have been spies and informers, a class not usually rated as
the most‘ reliable by people who have had experience with
them.’ In this record the nearest approach to any iden-
tiﬁable source of information is that some of the jailed
persons had admitted past membership in organizations

listed by the Attorney General as “communist,” or “com-_.
munist_ front.” These listings are made by the Attorney

General ex parte on secret dossiers containing statements
from sources that the Attorney General refuses to reveal.
A majority of this Court has held that such listings are
illegal. Anti-Fascist -Committee V. M cG'rath, 341 U. S.

ments in No. 35. My own judgment is that Congress
has not authorized the Bureau. of Immigration to hold

CARLSON v. LANDON. 7

people in jail without bond solely because it believes them
“dangerous.” Nor do I think that Congress has power
to grant any such authority even if it had attempted to
do so. * '

First. Section 23 of the Internal Security Act, 64 Stat.
987, 1010, provides that “Pending ﬁnal determination of
the deportability of any alien taken into custody under
warrant of the Attorney General, such alien may in the
discretion of the Attorney General (1) be continued in
custody; or (2) be released under bond in the amount of
not less than $500 with security approved by the Attorney
General; or (3) be released on conditional parole.” I
read this language as attempting to authorize the Attor-
ney General to hold aliens without bail within his dis-
cretion. I think that means the Attorney General’s
discretion, not that of a subordinate in the Bureau of
Immigration. This record does not show that these
people were jailed by virtue of an exercise of discretion
by the Attorney General. Decision to put deportable
aliens in jail without bond (with very minor exceptions)
was made by subordinates in the Bureau of Immigration.
I agree with MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER that this decision
to jail aliens en masse was not based on the kind of “dis-
cretion” the Act intended. But I further think § 23
should not be construed as permitting the Attorney Gen-
eral to delegate this tremendous power to others.

The Government ﬁnds a power to so delegate in provi-
sions of the Alien Registration Act of 1940, 8 U. S. C.
§ 458 (a) and in the President’s Reorganization Plan No.
2 of 1950, 5 U. S. C. (Supp. IV) following §133z-15.
These provisions are in such broad general terms that they
could be read as allowing the Attorney General to dele-
gate all his discretionary duties. But the gravity of a
discretionary power to seize people and keep them in jail
without a right of bail warns against implying such an un-

limited power to delegate it. It is bad enough to read an

determination ‘as to their deportability, under § 23 of the
Internal Security Act.‘ Differing views of the Courts
of Appeals led us to “grant certiorari. 342 U. S. 807,
810.

I. Facts.——The four petitioners in case No. 35 were

the Internal Security Act of 1950, charging each with
being an alien who was a member of the Communist

Act as vesting even the nation’s chief prosecutor with
power to determine what individuals he prosecutes should
be held in jail without bail. Delegating and redelegating
this dangerous power to subordinates entrusted with duties
like those of deputy sheriffs and policemen raises serious
procedural due process questions. I am" not willing to
imply that Congress has granted power to make such
delegations which so ominously threaten the liberty of
individuals. Consequently, assuming constitutionality
of § 23, I would hold that it vests power in the Attorney
General alone to decide whether a person should be denied
bail.

Second. The Fifth Amendment commands that no
person shall be deprived of liberty without due process

of law. I think this provision has been violated here.

Surely it is not consistent with procedural due proc-
ess of law for prosecuting attorneys or their law enforce-
ment subordinates to make ﬁnal determinations as to
whether persons they accuse of something shall remain
in jail indeﬁnitely awaiting a decision as to the truth-
fulness of the accusations against them. In effect that
was done here. I have already referred to the trial judge’s
statement in No. 35 that he was not going to release peo-
ple the Attorney General deemed to be bad security risks.
Moreover, the Immigration oﬂicial’s mere belief based on
statements coming from unidentiﬁed persons was accepted
by both trial judges as casting on each alleged “alien Com-
munist” the burden of proving he was not a Communist by
clear and convincing evidence. And their refusals to in-
criminate themselves by denying the Immigration of-
ﬁcer’s suspicions was accepted as sufficient proof to keep
them behind the jail doors. I think that condemning
people to jail is a job for the judiciary in accordance with
procedural “due process of law.’.’ 8 To farm out this re-

1076 and note pp. 1079-1083.

 

 

CARLSON v. LANDON. 9

sponsibility to the police and prosecuting attorneys is a
judicial abdication in which I will have no part.

Third. As previously pointed out, the basis of ‘holding
these people in jail is a fear that they may indoctrinate
people with Communist beliefs. To put people in jail
for fear of their talk seems to me to be an abridgment
of speech in ﬂat violation of the First ‘Amendment. I
have to admit, however, that this is a logical application
of recent cases watering down constitutional liberty of
speech.” I also realize that many believe that Commu-
nists and “fellow travelers” should not be accorded any
of the First Amendment’s protections. My belief is that
we must have freedom of speech, press and religion
for all or we may eventually have it for none. I further
believe that the First Amendment grants an absolute
right to believe in any governmental system, discuss all
governmental affairs, and argue for desired changes in
the existing order. This freedom is too dangerous for bad,
tyrannical governments to permit. But those who wrote
and adopted our First Amendment weighed those dangers
against the dangers of censorship and deliberately chose
the First Amendment’s unequivocal command that free-
dom of assembly, petition, speech and press shall not be
abridged. I happen to believe this was a wise choice and
that our free way of life enlists such respect and love that
our Nation cannot be imperiled by mere talk. This be-
lief of mine may and I suppose does inﬂuence me to
protest whenever I think I see even slight encroachments
on First Amendment liberties. But the encroachment
here is not small. True it is mainly those alleged to be
present or past “communists” who are now being jailed for
their beliefs and expressions. But we cannot be sure more
victims will not be offered up later if the First Amend-

10 CARLSON v. LANDON.

ment means no more than its enemies or even some of its
friends believe it does.

Fourth. I think § 23 as construed and as here applied
violates the command of the Eighth Amendment that
“Excessive bail shall not be required . . . .” Under one
of the Government’s contentions, which the Court ap-
parently adopts, the Eighth Amendment’s ban on exces-
sive bail means just about nothing. That contention is
that Congress has power, despite the Amendment, to de-
termine “whether or not bail may be granted, or must be
granted, and the Constitution then forbids the exaction
of excessive bail.” Under this contention, the Eighth
Amendment is a limitation upon judges only, for while a
judge cannot constitutionally ﬁx excessive bail, Congress
can direct that people be held in jail without any right to
bail at all. Stated still another way, the Amendment
does no more than protect a right to bail which Congress
can grant and which Congress can take away. The
Amendment is thus reduced below the level of a pious
admonition. Maybe the literal language of the framers
lends itself to this weird, devitalizing interpretation when
scrutinized with a hostile eye. But at least until recently,
it has been the judicial practice to give a broad, liberal
interpretation to those provisions of the Bill of Rights
obviously designed to protect the individual from govern-
mental oppression. I would follow that practice here.
The court refuses to do so because (1) the English Bill of
Rights has never been thought to accord a right to bail in
all cases . .‘ .” and (2) “in criminal cases bail is not com-
pulsory where the punishment may be death.” As to
(1): The Eighth Amendment is in the American Bill of
Rightstof 1789, not the English Bill of Rights of 1689.
And it is well known that our Bill of Rights was written
and adopted to guarantee Americans greater freedom than
had been enjoyed by their ancestors who had been driven
from Europe by persecution. See Bridges V. California,

 

CARLSON v. LANDON. 11

314 U. S. 252, 264-265. As to (2): It is true bail has
frequently been denied in this country “when the punish-
ment may be death.” I fail to see where the Court’s

' analogy between deportation and the death penalty ad-

vances its argument unless it is also analogizing the
offense of indoctrinating talk to the crime of ﬁrst degree
murder.

Another governmental contention is this:' “The bail
provisions of the Eighth Amendment and of the statutes
relating thereto have always been considered as applicable
only to criminal proceedings. Since deportation proceed-
ings are not criminal in character, the Eighth ‘Amendment
has no application.” I reject the contention that this
constitutional right to bail can be denied a man in jail by
the simple device of providing a “not criminal” label for
the techniques used to incarcerate. Imprisonment await-
ing determination of whether that imprisonment is justi-
ﬁable has precisely the same evil consequences to an in-
dividual whatever legalistic label is used to describe his
plight. Prior to this Amendment’s adoption, history had
been ﬁlled with instances where individuals had been im-
prisoned and held for want of bail on charges that could
not be substantiated. Official malice had too frequently
been the cause of imprisonment. The plain purpose of
our bail Amendment was to make it impossible for any
agency of Government, even the Congress, to authorize
keeping people imprisoned a moment longer than was
necessary to assure their attendance to answer whatever
legal burden or obligation might thereafter be validly im-
posed upon them. In earlier days of this country there
were fond hopesthat the bail provision was unnecessary,
that no branch of our Government would ever want to
deprive any person of bail. On this subject Mr. Justice
Story said, “The provision would seem to be wholly un-
necessary in a free government, since it is scarcely pos-
sible that any department of such a government would

 

 

 

« 12 CARLSON v. LANDON.

authorize or justify such atrocious conduct.” Story on
Constitutional Law, 5th Ed., Vol. 2, p. 650. Perhaps the
word “atrocious” is too strong. I can only say that I
regret, deeply regret, that the Court now adds the right
to bail to the list of other Bill of Rights guarantees that
have recently been "weakened to expand govermental
powers at the expense of individual freedom.

I am for reversing in No. 35 and afﬁrming in No. 136.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BUR-

If the Attorney General after the Internal Security Act
had made a general ruling that thereafter he would not
allow bail to any alien against whom deportation proceed-
ings were started and who was then a member of the Com-
munist Party—an undiscriminating, unindividualized
class determination—it would disregard the clear direc-

tion of Congress for this Court not to hold that the Attor- ,

ney General had exceeded the limits of his discretion. It
would wilfully disregard the adjudications on bail in de-
portation cases which preceded the Act an.d the unambigu-

ous legislative history of the law based upon this judicial
history. Congress unequivocally chose not to give non-
reviewable discretionary power to the Attorney General
to deny bail. In substance though not formally he has
made such a general ruling. The records before us dis-
close that since the Internal Security Act the Attorney
General has in fact followed the general practice of deny-
ing bail to all active communists. Such blanket exercise
of the power granted him by the Act calls for review and
cannot stand.

The controlling questions in this case are: What stand-
ards of discretion does the Internal Security Act of 1950 1
impose upon the Attorney General in granting or deny-
ing bail to persons arrested for deportation proceedings;
and has the Attorney General here observed those stand-
ards? The Government concedes that Congress made
reviewable the discretion of the Attorney General on the
bail question. This subjection of the Attorney General’s
action to judicial scrutiny is not to be formally or lightly
exercised. The bill which ultimately became § 23 of the
Internal Security Act was initially passed by the House
with a provision making absolute and unreviewable the
Attorney General’s action.” The bill as enacted, however,
omitted the ﬁnality clause; the Attorney General’s author-

releasing an alien from custody in an immigration case entirely in the
hands of the Attorney General . . . . It in no way denies the right
of any alien to test the legality of his detention through the courts;
it merely states that the alien cannot be released by the court until

ity was thus deﬁned: “Pending. ﬁnal determination of the
deportability of any alien . . . [he] may, in the discretion
of the Attorney General, (1) be continued in custody; or
(2) be released under bond in the amount of not less than
$500, with security approved by the Attorney General ; or
(3) be released on conditional parole.” 3 Before the pas-
sage of the Act Congress had before it conﬂicting views of
Courts of Appeals: according to Prentis V. M anoogian, 16
F. 2d 422 (C. A. 6th Cir.), bail was a matter of the alien’s
right; the Second Circuit ruled that it was a matter within
the Attorney General’s discretion subject to judicial re-
view. United States ex rel. Potash v. District Director,
169 F. 2d 747 (C. A. 2d Cir.).‘ Congress chose the latter
view.‘ It deserves emphasis that it was discretion that
was given the Attorney General, not power to decide
arbitrarily.‘

3 Internal Security Act of 1950, §23, 64 Stat. 987, 1010, 8 U. S. C.
(Supp. IV, 1946) § 156 (a) (emphasis added).

‘H. R. Rep. No. 1192, 81st Cong., lst Sess. 5-6, commenting on
H. R. 10, which made the Attorney General’s discretion unreviewable,
yet gave “discretion” to Attorney General, said:

“This [existing law] has often been found to be lacking in clarity and
doubtful in purpose when questions have arisen concerning procedure
following arrest of an alien, or during the interim between his arrest
and his hearing and decision on his case . . . . The committee be-
lieves that this bill will greatly simplify such details.”

A memorandum from a lawyers’ group which was read’ into the
record urged that to make the decision of the Attorney General un-
reviewable “ﬂouts the recent decision of the circuit court of appeals
of the second circuit,” citing United States ex rel. Potash v. District
Director, 169 F. 2d 747. 96 Cong. Rec. 10454.

with the clause “Where the Controller has reasonable grounds to
believe,” which the Privy Council had before it in Nakkuda Ali v.
De S. Jayaratne, [1951] A. C. 66. It was held, in the judgment of
Lord Radcliffe, “that there must in fact exist such reasonable grounds,
known to the Controller, before he can validly exercise the power”
conferred. And for this reason: “After all, words such as these

 

 

4 CARLSON v. LANDON.

In granting the Attorney General discretion subject to
judicial review, Congress legislated against a historical
background which gives meaning to bail provisions. Only
the other day this Court restated the concept of bail
traditional in American thought and reﬂected in the
Constitution :

“This traditional right to freedom before conviction
[or before order for deportation] permits the unham-
pered preparation of a defense, and serves to prevent
the inﬂiction of punishment prior to conviction. . . .
Since the function of bail is limited, the ﬁxing of
bail for any individual defendant must be based upon
standards relevant to the purpose of assuring the
presence of that defendant. . . . To infer from the
fact of indictment [or warrant for deportation] alone
a need for bail in an unusually high amount is an
arbitrary act.” Stack v. Boyle, 342 U. S. 1, 4, 5, 6.

“The practice of admission to bail, as it has evolved
in Anglo-American law, is not a device for keeping
persons in jail upon mere accusation until it is found
convenient to give them a trial. On the contrary,
the spirit of the procedure is to enable them to stay
out of jail until a trial has found them guilty. . . .
Each defendant stands before the bar of justice as
an individual. . . . Each accused is entitled to any

are commonly found when a legislature or law—making authority con-

fers powers on a minister or ofﬁcial. However read, they must be
intended to serve in some sense as a condition limiting the exercise
of an otherwise arbitrary power. But if the question whether the
condition has been satisﬁed is to be conclusively decided by the man
who wields the power the value of the intended restraint is in effect
nothing. No doubt he must not exercise the power in bad faith: but
the ﬁeld in which this kind of question arises is such that the reserva-
tion for the case of bad faith is hardly more than a formality.” Id.,

beneﬁts due to his good record, and misdeeds or a bad
record should prejudice only those who are guilty of
them.” Id., at 7, 8, 9 (concurring opinion). A

This historical meaning of “bail,” familiar even to lay-
men, must infuse our interpretation of the words of a
Congress of whom, in fact, a majority were lawyers.
When Congress provided for bail, within the Attorney
General’s discretion, for persons arrested for deportation
proceedings, it was extending to resident aliens still law-
fully in our midst the same privileges that are granted as
a matter of course to dangerous criminals. The factors
relevant to the exercise of discretion are factors that per-
tain to each individual as an individual. “Discretion is
only to be respected when it is conscious of the traditions
which surround it and of the limits which an informed
conscience sets to its exercise.” °

If these aliens, instead of awaiting deportation pro-
ceedings, were held for trial under a Smith Act indict-

ment, they could not be denied bail merely because of the

indictment. Stack v. Boyle, supra. Membership in the
Communist Party—the charge which is the foundation
for the deportation proceedings-is surely not as great
a danger as a leading share in a conspiracy to advocate
the overthrow of the government by force, which was the
essence of the indictment in Dennis V. United States,
341 U. S. 494. And the opportunity for “the unhampered
preparation of a defense” is quite as important to the
alien arrested for deportation proceedings as it is to the
Smith Act defendant. We would hesitate to impute to
Congress, in the absence of some more explicit command,
an intent to make bail more readily available to those held
on a serious criminal charge than to those awaiting pro-
ceedings to determine the question of deportability. Con-

of deportabilityf’ Petitions for habeas corpus were
promptly ﬁled alleging that the detention without bond
was in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment 9 and the Eighth Amendment to the Consti-
tution of the United States, and that § 20 of the Immigra-
tion Act, as amended, was also unconstitutional. See
note 5, supra. The allegation appears below.”
Respondent ﬁled returns defending his orders of deten-
tion on the ground that there was reasonable cause to
believe that petitioners’ release would be prejudicial to
the public interest and would endanger the welfare and
safety of the United States. These returns were coun-
tered by petitioners with allegations of their many years
residence spent in this country without giving basis for
fear’ of action by them inimical to the public welfare
during the pendency of their deportation proceedings,
their integration into community life through marriage

3 Before the‘passage of the Internal Security Act the four petition-
ers had been arrested and admitted to bail on warrants charging
membership in groups advocating the overthrow of the Government
by force and violence. In our view of the issues now here, these
former happenings are immaterial to our consideration of this writ
of certiorari.

9 “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive ﬁnes imposed,
nor cruel and unusual punishments inﬂicted.”

1° “That section 20 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917,
as amended by section 23 of Public Law 831, 81st Congress (com-
monly known as Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950) and
section 1 of the Act of October 16, 1918 (8 U. S. C. 137), as
amended, are, and each of them is, unconstitutional and void in that
they deprive persons, including petitioner, of liberty and property
without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth amendment to
the Constitution of the United States in that they abridge the free-
dom of persons, including petitioner, of speech, the press and assembly
and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances,
in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, and in that they purport to authorize indeﬁnite detention of
persons, including petitioner, without bond prior to ﬁnal determina-
tion of deportability.”

 

 

 

 

6 CARLSON v. LANDON.

gress made no such distinction. Instead, it cast the At-
torney General’s authority in terms descriptive of the
customary power of commissioners or district judges in
admitting to bail.

The factors stated by the Second Circuit in the Potash
case, supra, at 751, which guided the enactment, are pre-
sumably the standards which Congress expected to be
observed: “The discretion of the Attorney General . . .
is to be reasonably exercised upon a consideration of such
factors, among others, as the probability of the alien be-
ing found deportable, the seriousness of the charge against
him, if proved, the danger to the public safety of his pres-
ence within the community, and the alien’s availability
for subsequent proceedings if enlarged on bail.”

Congress thus made provision for a fair assurance of
each alien’s availability in the event he is eventually
ordered deported. There is, however, not the slightest
indication in the Government’s returns or in the records
before us that each petitioner’s ties to family and com-
munity and each one’s behavior under an earlier warrant
against him do not assure his presence throughout the
deportation proceedings and thereafter. The records af-
ﬁrmatively indicate the contrary. Moreover, in deporta-
tion cases—-—as compared, for example, with prosecutions
under the Smith Act—the consideration that the individu-
als concerned may depart from the country is minimized
in signiﬁcance, ﬁrst, because compulsory departure from
the United States is just what they are contesting, and
secondly, if they do depart, the purpose of the deportation
proceedings is realized.

It would be unfair to Congress to deny that it followed
the traditional concept of bail by making “the danger
to the public safety of his presence within the commu-
nity” a criterion for bailability. No less must it be pre-
sumed that Congress required that each criterion should
be applied in the traditional manner, that is, by indi-

 



 

CARLSON v. LANDON. 7

vidualized application to each alien. In each case, the
alien’s anticipated personal conduct-and that alone——
must be considered. Also, how expeditiously each de-
portation proceeding can be concluded, and therefore how
long the bail in each case need be in effect, are relevant
considerations.

But it is argued that, since an introductory section of
the Internal Security Act makes a “legislative ﬁnding” of
the threat represented by the Party,’ Congress intended
membership in the Communist Party alone to serve as a
reasonable basis for believing individual aliens too danger-
ous to leave at large. Such an interpretation renders
meaningless the discretion granted the Attorney General
wherever the deportation charge is membership in the
Communist Party. The argument means that he may
exercise discretion as to bail only to deny bail. Con-
gress did not write such a Hobson’s choice into law. True,
the bail provisions apply to deportation proceedings
brought on other grounds. However, the absorbing con-
cern of Congress in the Internal Security Act was with the
problem of the Communist Party; that Act for the ﬁrst
time explicitly made membership in the Communist
Party a ground for deportation.‘ It puts Congress in a
stultifying position to suggest that it gave with one hand
only to take away -with the other.

In these cases the Attorney General has not exercised
his discretion by applying the standards required of him.
He evidently thought himself under compulsion of law
and made an abstract, class determination, not an indi-
vidualized judgment. When the ﬁve aliens were arrested
originally (one as late as June, 1950), all were released on
bail, ranging from $5,000 for one to $1,000 for another;

(Supp. IV, 1946) §§ 137, 137-3.

 

8 CARLSON v. LANDON.

three were released on $2,000 bail. Much is made of the
‘fact that the enactment of the Internal Security Act on
September 22, 1950, intervened between the original grant
of bail and the subsequent rearrest and detention of the
aliens. The only change in that Act relevant to these
deportation proceedings was the provision making mem-
bership in the Communist Party speciﬁcally a basis for
deportation.” New warrants charging membership in the
Communist Party at some time after entry were served on
the rearrested aliens in Los Angeles, though not on Zydok
in Detroit. The immigration authorities were by the Act

relieved of proving--in order to make a prima facie case—— '

that the Communist Party is an “organization . . . that
believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches . . . the over-
throw by force or violence of the Government.” 1° But in
the circumstances of today a legislative deﬁnition of the
Communist Party as an organization advocating violent
overthrow of government made little difference in the
required proof.“ At any rate, a complete answer is that
nowhere——either in his returns to the writs of habeas
corpus or elsewhere——has the Attorney ‘General made any
assertion that the Internal Security Act eased the proof of
deportability, indicating by his silence that such a factor
did not. inﬂuence his judgment.” The returns in the
Los Angeles cases supported the denial of bail solely by

the statement, “said facts cause the said Acting Commis-
sioner to believe that if the said petitioner[s] were en-
larged on bail [they] would engage in activities which
would be prejudicial to the public interest, and would
endanger thewelfare and safety of the United States.”
The return in Zydok’s case stated no reasons for the At-
torney General’s decision. The only evidence at the hear-
ings was also directed solely to the communist activities
of the aliens.

The insubstantiality of the evidence for showing any
danger in freeing each individual alien on bail raises ample
doubt whether the Attorney General exercised a discretion
as instructed by statute. ~—In Zydok’s case the claim is
that he had been a member of the Communist Party and
ﬁnancial secretary of a Hamtramck, Michigan, section in
1949, a year before his rearrest and denial of bail on Octo-
ber 23, 1950. From Zydok’s failure to deny present mem-
bership during his testimony, the District Court drew the
conclusion that he was “knowingly and wilfully partici-
pating in the Communist movement.” This was clearly
a violation of Zydok’s privilege against self-incrimination,
which he many times claimed.” But assuming that the
Attorney General had evidence before him that Zydok
was at present a member of the Communist Party, that
alone is insufficient to show danger in freeing him on
bail during the deportation proceeding. To deny bail, the
Attorney General should have a reasonable basis for be-

spirit and intention thereof and all of the factors concerning the
likelihood of the deportability and the activities of said alien had been
given careful consideration as well as the factors of undue hardship
which continued detention might impose.”

The radiograms, in October, 1950, to the District Director in De-
troit ordering Zydok’s rearrest and detention without bail gave no
reasons for the action.

13 See 20 Stat. 30, 18 U. S. C. §3481; Wilson v. United States, 149
U. S. 60, 66. See also Blau v. United States, 340 U. S. 159.

 

 

10 CARLSON v. LANDON.

lieving that the circumstances attending Zydok present
too hazardous a risk in leaving him at large.

There is also no evidence on the activities of the other
four aliens that is more recent than 1949—a year before
the issuance of the relevant warrants for deportation and
the denials of bail here under review-—with the exception
of a newspaper article by Carlson published in late 1950.
In fact, in the case of Carlisle and Stevenson the Gov-
ernment had no evidence of activity or membership in
the Communist Party more recent than the 1930’s.
Since all these aliens when previously arrested were re-
leased on bail, we cannot escape the conclusion that the
Attorney General after the enactment of the Internal
Security Act did not deny bail from an individualized
estimate of “the danger to the public safety of [each per-
son’s] presence within the community.” 1‘

14 In a case just decided, the Court of Appeals for the Second Cir-
cuit found a not unreasonable exercise of discretion by the Attorney
General in circumstances that are here wanting. An extract from
the opinion of Judge A. N. Hand illumines the differences:

“In his petition for the writ, Young alleged facts indicating that if
released he would be available for any further proceedings at which
his presence would be required. The return to the writ, however,
contained allegations which, if accepted, established a reasonable
foundation for the denial of bail by the Attorney General. Thus the
return, in addition to containing allegations of membership in the
Communist party, alleged that Young had once before escaped from
custody during earlier proceedings; that he had previously attempted
to enter the United States by furnishing a false identity and with a
fraudulent passport; and that during his present detention he refused
to answer questions relating to prior identiﬁcation, places of residence,
employment and home life. Section 2248 of the Judicial Code, 28
U. S. C. § 2248, requires that the facts alleged in the return be taken
as true unless impeached, and Young in his traverse to the return
did not refute those statements, nor did he in his motion for reargu-
ment, make any offer to prove the contrary, nor did he assert new
facts, which under 28 U. S. C. §2246 could have been accomplished

 

...,..ws.-_-.

CARLSON v. LANDON. 11

We are conﬁrmed in this conclusion by the Attorney
General’s practice. For we are advised by the Solicitor
General that it has been the Government’s policy since the
Internal Security Act to terminate bail for all aliens await-
ing deportation proceedings whom it ‘deems to be present
active communists, barring only those for whom special
circumstances of physical condition or family situation
compel an exception. The ordinary considerations of
availability to respond to the ﬁnal judgment of the
courts have apparently been ruled out by_ the Attorney
General since the enactment of the Internal Security Act.
All those whom the Government believes to be active com-
munists are considered unbailable without individualized
consideration of risk from their continued freedom. It
must therefore be inferred that the Attorney General
acted on the assumption that, because he was convinced
that the aliens here were present Communist Party mem-
bers, they were not bailable. These persons should have
the beneﬁt of an exercise of discretion by the Attorney
General, freed from any conception that‘ Congress had
made them in eﬁect unbailable. We think that the Cali-
fornia case should be returned to the District Court for
discharge of the four persons detained unless the Attor-
ney General within a reasonable time makes a new deter-
mination on the bail question using the standards here
outlined. And if Zydok is rearrested under a new war-
rant, the Attorney will have a fresh opportunity to exer-
cise his discretion in setting bail.

My reasons for dissent strike deeper than the bail pro-
visions of the Eighth Amendment. According to the
warrants of arrest issued on October 31, 1950, the peti-
tioners in No. 35 are being detained for deportation
because they were formerly members of the Communist
Party of the United States. Zydok, the respondent in
No. 136, was arrested for present Communist Party mem-
bership, but no charge has been made that he has been
guilty of any seditious conduct or that he has committed
any overt act endangering our national security. If the
Constitution does not permit expulsion of these aliens for

MR. JUSTICE BURTON, dissenting.

I join the dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANK-
FURTER and add the suggestion that the Eighth Amend-
ment lends support to the statutory interpretation he
advocates. That Amendment clearly prohibits federal
bail that is excessive in amount when seen in the light of
all traditionally relevant circumstances. Likewise, it
must prohibit unreasonable denial of bail. The Amend-
ment cannot well mean that, on the one hand, it prohibits
the requirement of bail so excessive in amount as to be
unattainable, yet, on the other hand, under like circum-
stances, it does not prohibit the denial of bail, which

CARLSON v. LANDON. X 5

and family connections, and their meticulous adherence
to the terms of previous bail, allowed under a former
warrant charging deportability. See note 8, supra. On
consideration of these undenied allegations, the trial court
determined that the Director had not been shown to have
abused his discretion.“ This order was reversed on the
ground that the Director “must state some fact upon
which a reasonable person could logically conclude that
the denial of bail is required to protect the country or to
secure the alleged alien’s presence for deportation should
an order to that effect be the result of the hearing.” 1’
On rehearing, the Director made allegation, supported
by affidavits, that the Service’s dossier of each petitioner
contained evidence indicating to him that each was at
the time of arrest a member of the Communist Party
of the United States and had since 1930 participated or
was then actively participating in’ the Party’s indoctrina-
tion of others to the prejudice of the public interest.
There was no denial of these allegations by any of the pe-
titioners, except Hyun, or any assertion that any of them
had completely severed all Communist aﬂiliations or con-
nections.“ As to Hyun the denial was formal and did not

-include any aﬂidavit denying the facts stated in the Di-

rector’s aﬂidavit. As the allegations are set out by the
Court of Appeals in the carefully detailed opinion of
Circuit Judge Stephens, we refrain from any further re-
statement here." The Court of Appeals aﬁirmed the Dis-
trict Court’s determination that there was substantial

evidence to support the discretion exercised in denying-

bail.

Respondent Zydok, in case No. 136, was arrested in
August 1949 under a recent warrant charging that he
was subject to deportation as an alien with membership
in an organization advocating the violent overthrow of
the Government. Act of October 16, 1918, as amended,
8 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) § 137. At that time he was released
on $2,000 bail. Later a deportation hearing was held by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service but this
Court’s decision in Wong Yang Sung v. M cG’rath, 339
U. S. 33, necessitated a second deportation hearing.

After the effective date, September 23, 1950, of the In-
ternal Security Act of 1950, respondent was again taken
into custody by petitioner on the 1949 warrant, pursuant
to radiogram direction from the Acting Commissioner of
Immigration and Naturalization referring to § 20 of the
Immigration Act of 1917, as amended by § 23 of the In-
ternal Security Act. The respondent was held without
bail by petitioner under an order from the Acting Com-
missioner of Immigration. The rearrest was based on
§ 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 which provides
for the deportation of aliens who are members of or affili-
ated with the Communist Party. 8 U. S. C. (Supp. IV)
§ 137.

Thereupon respondent ﬁled a petition for writ of habeas
corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan, challenging the validity of his de-
tention without bail. The District Court found that pe-
titioner was an alien and had been and was on arrest a
member of the Communist Party. The court determined
that there had been no abuse of administrative discretion
in refusing bail and denied the petition for habeas corpus."

15 Quite properly, we think, no question is raised as to the appli-
cability of the Internal Security Act amendments relating to member-
ship in the Communist Party and allowance of bail, notes 4 and 5,

 

 

CARLSON v. LANDON. 7

The Court of Appeals for_ the Sixth Circuit reversed
the District Court, holding that in determining denial
of bail the Attorney General could not rest on member-
ship alone in the Communist Party but was under the
duty to consider also the likelihood that the alien would
appear when ordered to do so under the circumstances
as developed in the habeas corpus hearing. The court
thought the failure of the Attorney General to allow bail
was an abuse of discretion.

That court agreed that the District Court was correct
in ﬁnding that Zydok was a member of the'Communist
Party and had been in 1949 the ﬁnancial secretary of its
Hamtramck Division. The respondent’s testimony justi-
ﬁes the District Court’s ﬁnding set out in the margin.“
The record shows other information in the ﬁles of the
Attorney General, such as attendance on closed meetings
of the Party and the Michigan State Convention. The
opinion succinctly sets out the facts concerning respond-
ent’s integration into American life. . We adopt that
statement." It was said:

1° “That the petitioner, while under cross-examination by the Chief
Assistant United States Attorney, was a consistently evasive witness
and his evasive demeanor in testifying in relation to his communistic
activities convinces this Court that he is knowingly and wilfully
participating in the Communist movement.”

“Appellant was seventeen years of age when he arrived in this
country from Poland in 1913. Since then he has lived continuously
in the State of Michigan. He has been a waiter in an English

own home in Detroit and has a family consisting of his wife, two sons,

and proper decision in view of all the attending cir-
cumstances. The Styria V. Morgan; 186 U. S. 1, 9,

The Court of Appeals concluded:

“We think that a fair consideration of the factors
above set out in their aggregate require that appel-
lant should have been granted bail in some reason-
able amount. This view is more nearly in accordance
with the spirit of our institutions as it relates even
to those who seek protection from the laws which
they incongruously seek to destroy. See Carlson v.
Landon, Dist. Director, 9 Cir., 186 F. 2d 183; United
States ex rel. Potash v. Dist. Director, 2 Cir., 169 F.
(2d) 747, 752.” Id., 804.

II. The Issues.—Petitioners in No. 35, the Carlson
case, and respondent in No. 136, the Zydok case, seek re-
spectively reversal or aﬂirmance principally on the same
grounds. It is urged that the denial of bail to each was
arbitrary and capricious, a violation of the Fifth Amend-
ment; that where there is no evidence to justify a fear of
unavailability for the hearings or for the carrying out of a
possible judgment of deportation, denial of bail under the

a daughter, and ﬁve grandchildren. Both sons served in the armed
services of the United States in World War II. His children and
grandchildren were born in this country and his daughter married
here. During World War II while appellant was head waiter in
the restaurant he sold about $50,000.00 worth of U. S. War Bonds
and during that period he donated blood on seven occasions to the
Red Cross for the United States Army.

“Before his second arrest and while he was at large on bail he
reported regularly to the Department of Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service. The record fails to disclose that he has violated any
law or that he is engaged or is likely to engage in, any subversive
activities.”

circumstances of these cases is an abuse of discretion and
violates a claimed right- to reasonable bail secured by the
Eighth Amendment to "the Constitution. Zydok urges,
also, that there was an abuse of discretion in rearresting
him, when there was no change of circumstances, after
his previous release under bond on the same warrant.
There are other minor contentions as to irregularities in
the proceedings that appear to us immaterial to our con-
sideration of these cases.

The basis for the deportation of presently undesirable
aliens resident in the United States is not questioned and
requires no reexamination. When legally admitted, they
have come at the Nation’s invitation, as visitors or perma-
nent residents, to -share with us the opportunities and
satisfactions of our land. As such visitors and foreign
nationals they are entitled in their persons and effects
to the protection of our laws. So long, however, as aliens
fail to obtain and maintain citizenship by naturalization,
they remain subject to the plenary power of Congress to
expel them under the sovereign right to determine what
noncitizens shall be permitted to remain Within our
borders.“

Changes in world politics and in our internal economy
bring legislative adjustments affecting the rights of var-
ious classes of aliens to admission and deportation.” The
passage of the Internal Security Act of 1950 marked such
a change of attitude toward_alien members of the Com-
munist Party of the United States. Theretofore there
