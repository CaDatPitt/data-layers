GE has a huge financial
stake in nuclear power. They
not only want to sell nuclear
plants, they also want to sell
an ever increasing supply of
electricity to satisfy GE's
investors, who want the
company to grow as‘ fast as
possible.

Over the past decade, use of
electricity doubled in the
U.S. GE's annual sales rose
from $7 to $13 billion in the
year 2000. U.S. electrical
consumption must increase
correspondingly--to over four
time the present level.

GE continues to pin
hopes on nuclear power
spite of public protest,
the heavy financial losses
that General Electric and
other nuclear suppliers have
weathered in recent years.

LAUGH FOR THE DAY
The General Electric Co.'s Executive l

Vice-President for Power Systems, Herman. R.
Hill said, "If the President who has just been
inaugurated does not immediately do something
forceful nuclear is over."

In a statement which resulted in laughter
among the NRC commissioners, Hill said, "GE is
not in this business because it is a great
money maker. It is a social responsibility
and we honestly believe it is something that
has to be done for this country.”

WE COULD BE BOYCOTTING GE
BECAUSE OF LABOR PRACTICES

GE laid off 500 workers at the
Ashland plant while expanding
operations in Asia. In 1972 the
company laid off 500 workers in
Pittsfield, Massachusetts and
threatened to lay off more unless
workers there accepted a $25 per
week cut in pay--which they did.
Between 1965 and 1972, employment
at GE's Syracuse, N.Y., radio and
TV production plants dropped from
19,000 to 8,000, largely because of
transfer of these operations abroad.

Over the past 40 years, the only
protection that GE workers have had
against some abuses of the company's
power has been the labor movement.

WOMEN WORKERS HAVE

ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS
Women's jobs require tremendous
eye concentration -----
The fact is they actually can be
more exhausting and require more
physical effort than higher
paying men's jobs -----
Many women at GE never rise above
the entry level wage for janitors
even after 30 to 40 years of
experience with the company -----

THE RATIONALE FOR AN INTERNATIONAL BOYCOTT OF GENERAL ELECTRIC

In the early spring of 1980, a Cincinnati TV reporter found she had to interview 60
people to find 6 who were in favor of Nuclear Power. Her conclusion from this was that
anti-nukers need a way to express their opposition.

QUESTION: HOW CAN THE AVERAGE PERSON SAY "NO" TO NUCLEAR POWER?

1. A boycott of General Electric is appropriate because:

G.E. is a leading producer in every phase of nuclear development,
G.E. has a large home appliance line which makes them accessible,
G.E. pushes proliferation of nuclear weapons by selling reactors to
the Third World,

G.E. likes the image of "Better things for living".

2. The climate is good:

Great numbers of people are looking for non-threatening ways to express opposi-
tion to nuclear power.

There are strong anti-big-business feelings in many places.

The concept of "Peace Conversion" (planning in advance for peacetime job
training for use of converted nuclear facilities) applied to G.E. would
reinforce and be reinforced by the boycott.

Three out of four unions in G.E. have endorsed the idea of Peace Conversion
(United Auto Workers, International Association of Machinists, and United
Electrical Workers).

3. Easy boycott:

Network of anti-nuke groups is already formed.

Great numbers of publications are sympathetic.

Therefore.....minimal amount of print and postage.

No need to sacrifice - as in grapes and lettuce: alternatives exist.
G.E. manufacturing/merchandising in every city for local focus.
Buying selectively is the common mode.

MOBE (AFSC, WRL, WILPF, CLC, etc.) is the international umbrella.

4. Potential:

An examination of G.E.'s nuclear industry would help the public understand the
linkage between nuclear power and nuclear weapons.

Following the rule, "Divide and conquer", G.E. will be targeted for maximum
pressure. Success would give the movement momentum to challenge the rest
of the industry.

The skills, the energy, the natural resources, the capital now used by the
nuclear industry could be used for human needs.

The nuclear struggle is being fought on grounds of health and morality.

Public opinion is being expressed in legislature, in courts and in the
streets. The economic basis remains to be challenged. The boycott
will do this.

THE G.E. BOYCOTT = ECONOMIC LEVERAGE
