‘W E CAN MAK E

DENVER, Colo.——Tl1e Interna-
tional Executive Board of Mine-
Mill, during a week-long session
here,_ has adopted a series of
hard-hitting policy statements,

including a ringing call for main-‘

tenance of “free and direct col-
lective bargaining with our em-
ployers on our just demands forvwages,

health insurance, pensions and other
conditions and benefits.”

The Board described the govern-
ment's wage freeze order as “a road-
block in the path ofmillions of wage
earners who are feeling the pinch of
the highest living costs and taxes in
American history."

“We can and must make substantial
gains for our members this year,” the
Board said as it insisted that “we will
not allow the Wage Stabilization Board
to be used as a pretext for stalling by
any employer, nor as an agency to veto
rightful gains won by free collective
bargaining and the strength of our
union.” (See page 7 for Board state-
ment on the wage freeze.)

IN A SEPARATE overall policy
statement, the Mine-Mill leaders said
the defense mobilization program has
been “contrived for the purpose of mak-
ing the rich richer and the poor poorer,”
and added that “the sham price control

President’s proposals for ‘taxing until

YELLOWKNIFE, N.W.T.—The big-
gest wage increase ever won in the

territories has been bagged by mem-

bers of ' Yellowknife District Miners’
Union Local 802. It calls for an across-
the-board hike of 20 cents an hour, and
means Yellowknife will be earning the
highest base rate for any gold mine
in Canada.

The new contract also provides for

[Nun additional statutory holiday, as well

.-,‘Kf

 

as a clause under which the company
guarantees to pay at least 40 hours
wages per month for purposes of safe-
ty inspections.

In addition, the allowances in the
contract for housing of both married
and single men were strengthened,
which had the effect of increasing the
earnings.

The vacation clause was re-worded to
eliminate inequities. J. A. Scott, Local
802 business agent, assisted in ne-
gotiation ‘of the contract.

 

it hurts{ are all part of 9. pattern of
squeezing the wage earner, the farmer
and the small businessman for the
benefit of the big profiteer.”

Proposals being considered by Con-
gress for increasing income and excise

taxes would “mean a further impover-
ishment of wage earners,” .the Board
said. as it called for enactment of a
100 per cent excess profits tax without
delay “to take some of the profiteering
out (if the Korean war” and demanded
that taxes on incomes below $5,000 a
year be restored to pre-Korean levels.

A rollback of allprices to the level
of June 1, 1950, with “real enforcement.
and punishment of violations” was in
the list of Board demands, which re-
affirmed “our solid opposition to any
form of wage freeze.”

The Mine-Mill leaders called atten-
tion to newspaper reports of “a mount-
ing ground-swell of popular demand
for withdrawal of all American troops
from Korea and against sending U. S.
troops to Europe,”' and added? “The
people of America are trying to say
they want peace, not war.”

“This union will continue to press for
adoption of policies ‘by our govern-
ment's. and our nations’ delegates to
the United Nations that are aimed at
peace and do not flirt capriciously with
war,” it said. (See pages 2 and 3 for
overall Board statement.)

AN URGENT PLEA that the gov-
ernment lift the order forbidding use
of copper in some 300 civilian goods

' was addressed by’ the Board to Pres-

ident Truman, defense mobilizer C. E.
Wilson and defense production director
William Harrison. The message called
attention to the 400,000-ton govern-
ment stockpile of copper and urged that
stockpiling be “suspended for at least
six months as was done in the case of
zinc.” (See page 5 for Board statement
on copper ban.)

The Board indicated a determination
to step up the fight for civil rights of
trade unionists, foreign-born, Negroes
and Mexican-Americans, and to block
the drive toward “silencing of every
dissenting voice, whether by intimida-
tion, by jail, by concentration camp or
by hangman’s noose.” “We cannot and
will not sit idly by as our governments
march in the direction of police stat-

- ism.”

The Board appointed a minority.
rights committee, with Raymond Den-
nis, District 3 board member as chair-
man, and including Alton Lawrence,
District 5 board member; Ches Smoth-
ermon, District 2 board member; and

ask for union election

NEW TORONTO, Ont.——The Ontario
Labor Board has set February 20 as
the date for a hearing on the petition
of Mine-Mill for a representation elec-
tion at the W. C. Hardesty Co. here.
Workers at the_plant are signed up
in the union almost 100 percent.

The company granted a 25 cent an
hour. wage increase, but the workers
are more convinced than ever that they
want a union.

 

Here is the text of an overall statement of policy adopted at
‘the February 8-14 meeting of the Mine-Mill International E.vecut'ive
Board. Members of our union are urged to read this statement care-
fully and to talk it over in terms of what it means to them, their-

familvles and their local unions.

This Executive, Board of the Interna- ‘

tional Union of Mine,iMill and Smelter
Workersfholding its first meeting of
.1951, vigorously reaffirms the policy
statement it issued just a year ago.
_As we said then, we are proud that
our union’s greatest strength lies in its

internal democracy which gives _every_

local andpevery member the right to
disagree, the right to express any opin-
ion, without fear of reprisal.

Because of this internal democracy,

.. and the militancy and unity it makes

possible,-this union has made steady
" gains for its_ members during the past
year in the face of the-_ most vicious
raiding onslaught ever made ‘by one
union -against another.
Because of this internal democracy,
we can proudly rep_ort.-that our union is
not only stronger and more unified

than a.ye_ar.ago,-but numerically larger-

The net result of the raiding attacks
upon our union is that we have" grown
in size, not diminished. ,

- At the same timoiwe are deeply con-
cerned over the new and critical Prob-
lems, which confront our members as
a direct outgrowth of the so-called “de-
fense mobiliza.tion'r’ program.

0 Prices are .-frozen-—'-at their high-
est levels in hvlstorg/—.and then thawed
out enough for further rises.

G ‘Wages are frozen at levels that
leave a yawning gap between take-

‘ home pay and costsgf.-living essentials.

O Butgshamefully-hz'gh_ profits are
not frozen. . _

OrrNor isthere a freeze on the belly-
robbing taxes which take bigger and
bigger bites out of the workingmaln’
wages. ‘

We can only conclude that the “de-
fense mobilization” Program‘ has been
contrived.for- the purpose of making

‘the rich richer and the poor poorer. '

The sham price control order, the
freegeon wages and the ,President’_s
proposals for"‘taxing.unti1 it hurts”

' ‘are all part of a pattern of squeezing

-the ..Wa§e'.ea.rnc.r._ the farmer and the
small businessman for the benefit of
the ._big profiteer. ~

Profiteering ,

, The-sacrifices asked bythe President
of low income people are calculated to
produce the continued super-profits of
1950-51. Freezing prices at their high-
est levels in history assures continued
profitccrins on consumer goods; high-
er taxes "on .low incomes furnishes
money for the government to use in
paying_,super,_profits on armament con-
tracts; if _

American corporations made. $1.60 in
the third quarter of 1950 for every $1
of profitin the same quarter of 1949.
This ~. brought them annual profits of

241/; billion dollars, after taxels_.cFor 'the_

non-ferrous metals industry, profitee_r-
ing _. was . even greater. The ‘industry
‘average was $3 in the third quarter of
1950 for every $1 a year earlier. Fifteen
of the largest non-ferrous corporations
made. the staggering profit of $6.63
to‘ $1. , g ’
As the National City Bank of ‘New
York bluntly put it, the “price. c_ont1_-ol"

order rewards. those “who have raised‘

prices most.” There is even no pretense
of controlling prices on foodstuffs for
which the wage earner spends at least
half’ of his income. 

/ The order exempts all war materials,

which means still further..shortages of ,

consumer goods and still greater oppor-
tunities for profiteering.. - -

more nakedly revealed than in the Tru-
man tax program, a program put for-
ward with the announced intention of
reducing the living standards of wage
earners?’ . ‘

For the family man earning $2,500
a year (50 a week) it will mean‘ 20
per cent more income tax-——every cent
of which will mean less food on the
table, less clothing or less heat. For the
corporation executive with a salary of
more than $1 million a year ($20,000 a
week) it will only mean 3‘/2 per cent‘
more income tax.

The proposed heavier excise taxes on
cigarets, beer, gasoline, radios and
other/consumer goods would mean a
further impoverishment of wage earn-
ers.‘ It would, place many essentials
beyond the reach of workers’ pocket-
books. , -

Charles E. Wilson of General Elec-
tric, described by the United Electrical
Workers as “the most anti-labor indi-
viduals” ___among employers, has been
made dictatorpover wages, prices and
virtuallyeverything else. Cyrus Ching
of U. S. Rubber is in charge-_of'wage
stabilization. W

These men now have it within their
power to issue decrees wiping out gains
for which working people have strug-
gled for half a century. They will go as
far in this direction as the people per-
mit. We hear repeated and bolder pro-
posals for a 44-hour and 48-hour week
without overtime pay. And we are also
shocked by the open proposals of gov-
ernment and corporation leaders to
freeze and conscript manpower, so that
laboring men can be shipped like cattle

from one part of the country to an-_

other, and forced to work wherever de-
creed by the government's Big-Business
mobilizers.

Speedup is ‘official’

.Gri_nding speedup, which has been

- growing steadily more‘ serious since the

end of World War II, is now becoming
a matter of official policy, given the
phony justification that it is necessary
in order to‘ secure needed “production.”

mobilizers” has already caused alarm-
ing layoffs and cutbacks in many in-
dustries, including the important brass
industi-y—-at a time when copper out-
put is close to all-timd high levels and
the need for brass products is over-
whelming. The layoffs and short work-
weeks in the brass industry are espe-
cially vicious in view of the tremendous
stockpile of copper held by the gov-
ernment. ‘ ‘

One of Mobilizer Wilson’s first ap
pointments was that of Fred Searls as
Materials Specialist in charge’ of raw
materials production. Searls is presi-
dent of Newmont Mining Co. He has
been listed by the Federal Trade Com-
mission as one of six men who “are in
a position to dictate the production and
price policies of about 60 per cent of
the world output of primary copper.”

Wall Street is happy

Reactions‘ to the wage freeze order
are highly significant. Wall Street re-
sponded with jubilation, as major
stocks went up four points. So-called
“labor leaders” who had been support-
ing Ttruman and endorsing the principle
of deflating workers’ incomes, have is-
sued mild protests, but have made no
move to mobilize and express the well-
known resentment of their member-
ships.

Loudest protests of AFL and CIO
leaders have been over their failure to
get more jobs and titles in the adminis-
trative machinery being set up to rob
the wage earner.

ClO’s representative on the National
Wage Stabilization Board, Emil Rieve,
joined with other members of the Board
late last year in calling for depressed
wages, speedup, longer hours, higher
taxes. After failing for three years
even to ask for a raise for his own
members in the textile industry, Rieve
agreed that the nation. must “mini-
mize to the greatest practical degree
the volume of money and credit avail-
able for spending on . . . civilian goods
and services.”

No matter how C10 spokesmen may
now, under pressure from their mem-
bership, protest the wage-price-tax

'squeeze, they cannot escape the fact
i that their representative on the Board

helped prepare the groundwork for it.

Mine-Mill's economic program -

Our union, as on organization
deditctted to the never-ending
struggle for the welfare of its mem-
bers, cctnnot otccept any part of the
profits-from-poverty pogrdm.

We believe that a ﬁght for the
welfare oi American and'Ccmadi<:n
working people is a patriotic duty
of workers’ organizations. The

.5l<IndSI.rd 91 living :31 our working

people should be the concern of
every, American who is not hell-
bent for war profiteering.

We intend to push forward with '

(1 program of fighting for higher
wages, better conditions and more
security for our members. We call
upon every local union and every
member to throw their strength
into this effort for the benefit of all.

-. , _  ganized labor. -

‘B * More and more corporations exploit

. the McCarran Act and Administration-
fed hysteria to “screen” their em-
ployees, hoping to eliminate the more
militant and effective union leaders.

V Trade unions increasingly are forced

'10’ go into employer-controlled courts
, -or before employer-controlled boards
' under conditions which. make a fair
trial or hearing impossible.

The mounting fury with which mi-
norities are being repressed is typi-_
fied -by the frame-up conviction and
execution of seven Martinsville Ne-
groes by the State of Virginia in what
was clearly a brutal gesture tater-

   

   
   
  

  
  

All this is supposed to be justi-
fied by the fact that the nation
faces a “war emergency." Yet no

, satisfactory'reason has been ad-
vanced to explain why a “war
emergency" when many——or most
——of the avenues to genuine, hon-
orable peace still remain unex-
plored.

The newspapers tell us there is E:
mounting ground-swell of popular
demand for withdrawal of all

~ American troops from Korea and
against sending U. S. troops to

Europe. They report that the Amer-

ican people are saying, in a variety

of ways." that they want our gov-

ernment to undertake face-to-face
, negotiations with Russia and with
 ‘ Republican China on key outstand-
. I. ing differences. The people of
.. 3‘ America are trying to say they
i want peace, not war.

—We believe—as we have said rei
 '_peatedly during the past year-
. that a disastrous global war can
and must be averted.

 iv’ We also believe the surest way
to. bring on a global war is to en-
gage in a gigantic arms program.
Peace ishpossible only if the lead-
 ers of the five great nations of the

rorize and intimidate every Negro in
America.

Similarly, we are shocked and an-
gered by the rapidly increasing num-
ber of frame-up attempts to frighten
the Mexican-American people. A typ-
ical example of this terrorization was
the recent incident at Sonora, Arizona,

where two gun-happy deputies bra-'

tally shot four Mexican-American cop-
per miners, killing one and wounding
the others.

The nation is ridden with so many
witch-hunting committees and boards
that the witch-hunters are wracked
with jurisdictional‘ disputes. Their evil
purpose is the silencing of every dis-
senting voice, whether by intimidation,
by jail, by concentration camp or by
hangma_n’s noose. -

1. ‘id sit down at a table in the
g..-'e-and-take spirit of genuine col-

lective bargaining. to resolve their

differences. V
Instead of that, we are told that
there are only two choices for the

American people: War now or war,

_ later.

We are told that great sacrifices
must be made, as a patriotic duty,
because of a "war emergency," an
emergency which somehow re-
quires a wage freeze and a gen-
eral aséault on the living standards
of the American people.

._ Not a single sacrifice has been
proposed for the U. S. corporations
and munitions makers. On the con-

trary, they are now earning profits B

at the highest rate in history, and
are being assured still greater
profits at the expense of the na-
tion's working people.

This union will continue to press

for adoption of policies by our gov-
emments and our nations’ dele-

I gates to the United Nations that

are aimed at peace and do not ﬂirt
capriciously with war. We are

firmly convinced that we are-in the’

mainstream of public opinion both
in the United States and Canada
when we make that demand.

EVERBODY HAD A GOOD TIME at

Canada Mine—Mill conference held i-n Sudbury, OptariO, early this month,

Mccar-ran Act” repeal

Our fight to protect the’ basic civil
rights of ourmembers and of all Amer-
icans and Canadians must be ‘pressed
with even greater intensity. The Mc-
Carran, Taft-Hartley, Magnusson and
Smith Acts must be repealed, and the
more quickly they are wiped from the
books, the more certainly "will Amer-
ican democracy survive. We cannot and
will not sit idly by asour governments
march in the direction of police-statism.

This union/ has a long tradition of
fighting for the rights of Negroes,
Mexicans and all other minorities. This
Executive Board expresses pride in
that tradition and pledges our union to
continuation of the same fight in the

face of mounting intolerance and shock- A
‘ing frame-ups. t -

Organizing

Having set the raiders back on their
heels; we must now launch an intensive,
campaign to organize the remaining
unorganized workers in our industry.

We are pleased to announce that hun-
dreds of workers who had been tempo-
rarily deluded into leaving our union
have now returned to Mine-Mill.

Wage and contract gains made dur-
ing the past year by our union have
illustrated dramatically what can be

Won by a rank-and-file which is both
determined and unified. We reaffirm
the aggressive wage and contract pol-
icy adopted by our 1950 convention, and
we reject any tendency to permit either
employers or e m p 1 o y e r-controlled
boards to hold us back in the continu-
ing fight. for higher wages, better
health and welfare plans, pensions and
other contract benefits. The key to our
contract policy during this period must __
be insistence on free collective bargain-
ing ‘with special emphasis on “free.”

_‘ We are fully confident that this
union will respond with courage and
intelligence to the crucial tests of the
year 1951. That confidence rests in the
sure knowledge that the inner democ-
racy of our union will keep it healthy,
strong, determined and unified.

BESSEMER, A1a.—A history-mak-

Local 121 here. The victory is in the
_ form of\ an arbitration decision which

.‘ "-' for the first time establishes plant-wide
" ' ’ seniority at the Edwards Iron Ore Mine
of Republic Steel Co.

, The decision was handed down by
 'Arbitrator John E. Dwyer of Washing-

_ Israel, put the question squarely up
for decision, with the Union contend-
 ing that the “contract called for plant-

D. B.’ Robertson, president of the

“It is of course "unfortunate that in
our efforts. to reach a satisfactory
agreement with ‘the carriers we must
at the same tiine be confronted with

In our judgment his whole~.attitude,
which appears to beaiding and abet-
ting the railroads in overcoming the
just demands of the workers, is un-
tenable.” . ' i

J. P. Shields, president of the lftail-.

. nenatynlit raid in

Edmonton vote

EDMONTON, Alta.-—The AFL Boil-
ermakerslunion has been soundly de-
feated in an attempt to raid Mine-Mill
Local 864 at the Standard Iron &‘ Engi-
neering Works here. '

The Boilermakers had tried to-split
away a unit of 100 workers from this
250-man plant. But in 3 Labor Board
election held earlier this ‘month, the
AFL union got only 31 votes, »-while
Mine-Mill got 72. *

Following the election victory, Local
‘864 president Clarence ~Hayes ran-

gnounced that a settlement had been

reached with the company for an 11-
cent-an-hour package increase. Hayes
said that “The AFL raid hurt our bar-
gaining and undoubtedly cost every
wo1_‘_ker at leastthree cents hourly.”
Int’1 rep. William Longridge, in-
charge of the .Mine-Mill campaign to

defeat the raiders, declared" that “the ‘

results go to prove that the worker's
don't want to be split, and realize there
is no place for craft unionism in indus-
trial plants.” .“The' Mine-Mill victory
also proved~.that -—'workers at this ‘sub-

  ABC Council pledges
  fight for l95l demands

BUFFALO, N. Y.-‘Delegates to the .

'American Brass Council meeting here
February‘ 17th voted unanimously to
condemn the ‘Truman wage freeze and
to proceed full speed ahead in prepa-
rations’ for contract negotiations with
the company. _

The delegates confirmed the list of
major demands drawn up, at _the Ana-
conda,Council meeting held in January
and drew up a list of Local demands

— to be included among the Union’s pro-

posals in the coming contract negotia-
tions.

The Local demands included the
elimination of sections of the manage-
ment clause in the Torrington and An-
sonia plants, iving the company the

right to deter ‘tie the number of men

on any job, a guarantee of average
hourly earnings during any breakdown
of equipment, faulty equipment, ma-
terial shortage, etc., holidays with pay
for boiler’ and power house workers,
and vacation pay for all laid off work-
ers.

THE COUNCIL meeting was chaired
by Ernest Gunzalus, president of Local
593, who opened the morning session by
introducing the delegates and welcom-
ing them to Buffalo. ABC Coordinator
Irving Dichte'r reported on the critical
employment situatioir in the brass in-
dustry as a result of the so-called “de-
fense mobilization” program. He re-
ported on the trip made by the Con-
necticut Mine-Mill delegation,to Wash-
ington. '-

Board Member Pezzati followed with
a report of the action taken by the In-
ternational Executive Board on this

‘same question. The Board had worked

out a comprehensive program which
would immediately start a flow of
metal to Connecticut and ease the crit-
ical situation caused by the virtual
halt int he production of some 300 con-
sumer items. " ' ‘

Local union delegates reported on the
Local demandstd be included in the
coming negotiations withthe company.
Larry Cerniglia reported for Ansonia
Local 445, Ray Dowd for Local 423
and Bob Brown for Local 593. A sub-
committee of two delegates from each
local union was elected to unify these
demands and bring them to the Coun-
cil’s consideration during the after-
noon session. The sub-committee was
made up of George Morris, chairman;
Joe Scioli, secretary; Bob Brown,
Charles Meitner, Joseph Consolini,.Tom
Coury, Mike Gallarano, and John Gat-
tison. " - o

Vice-president Wilson opened the
discussion by reporting on the wage
policy adopted by the International
Executive Board at its recent session“.
He urged all the delegates to prepare

tions with the company and to take
vigorous action now against any at-

‘ tempt to freeze them in their present

wage scale. .

The delegation also wired Charles

the copper allocation program which
has brought so much suffering to the
brass workers. ' . ’

Under “good and welfare” the dele-
gates condemned the raiding activities
of the CIO. The UAW has just opened
a letter campaign among the Buffalo
workers. The delegates also voted to
establish the closest coordination with
the Anaconda workers in the coming
contract negotiations. _

shop to thaw freeze

MONMOUTH JUNCTION, N. J.—A
powerful protest demonstration against
the government freeze on wages was
made by members of Mine-Mill Local
908 here this month.

The protest took the form of a one-

~ day work stoppage, which closed the

shop down tight, and which showed the
management of Columbian Carbon that
the workers mean business in their de-
mand for a wage increase.

The workers are also pressing ‘for
the same termination date on their con-
tract as that on the contract of Mine-
Mill Local 670 at Trenton, N. J., with
the same company.

BUTTE, Mont.—Mine-Mill locals
both here and at. Great Falls have
joined the fight for action to relieve
the plight of American Brass Company
workers victimized by layoffs and cut-
backs. -

Butte Miners Union Local 1 approved
a resolution in support of a bill in Con-
gress to suspend. the duty on imported
copper. Copies of the resolution were
sent to Montana senators Murray and

Ecton and Congressmen Mansfield and
D’Ewart.

Great Falls Mill & Smeltermen’s Lo-
cal 16 sent strongly-worded letters to
the Office of Defense Production, as

well as Murray, Ecton, Mansfield and _

D’Ewart, urging that the government
“take responsibility for this curtail-
ment of copper and zinc used in the
production of brass,” and should award
government contracts “to these cur-

. tailed mills and factories.”

The actions of the Butte and Great
Falls locals were seen as an example
of co-operation among locals in the
Anaconda Copper Co. chain.

‘Lift copper ban’-—
brass workers urge

WASHINGTON, D. C.—A delegation
representing all Connecticut locals of
Mine-Mill spent two days here, Febru-
ary 13-14, in an attempt to ease the
restriction placed on the use of copper
and copper products which has resulted
in lay—offs and a short work week for
thousands of brass workers throughout
Connecticut.

The Union delegation met with all
the Connecticut Congressmen in town,
with Senator Brian McMahon and with
Paul Andrews, head of the Brass Divi-
sion of the National Production Author-
ity. They demanded immediate action
to relieve a situation which has become
critical for the brass workers.

They requested the rescinding of the
M12 Order which forbids the use of
copper for some 300 civilian items, the
lifting of the two-cent import duty on

copper, "a price ceiling on scrap andthe ‘

enactment of a bill to provide for pay-
ment of additional unemployment com-
pensation to brass workers whose
wages have been cut as a result of
this so-called defense program.

THE DELEGATION received a sym-
pathetic ear from the Congressmen and
Senator McMahon. Paul Andrews re-
ported to them that some of the re-
strictions on the use of copper for civil-
ian production was being lifted. But
it was apparent from his report that
this was not going to be enough to take
up the slack in production.

The delegates left Washington deter-
mined to make this the beginning of
their campaign to change some of the
so-called Defense Mobilization orders
which are strangling Connecticut brass
workers. They worked out a program
to involve every union in the industry
and their communities in putting pres-
sure on Washington. So far the only
union taking any action on this ques-
tion has been Mine-Mill. ‘

The delegation to Washington includ-
ed regional director Irving Dichter;
legislative committee chairman Henry
Rapuano; Raymond Dowd, president,
and John Cartenuti, both of Local 423;
D. James Supp, unit chairman, Michael
Gazy, president, Anthony Milardo, fi-
nancial secretary, all from Local 445;
also Charles Didsbury, president, and
James Blackner, recording secretary,
both of Local 620; Winslow Lesniewski,
Int’l rep., and Edward Coleman, pres-
ident of Local 552.

Jersey locals file
freeze ‘grievance’

PERTH AMBOY, N. J .—-Members of

Mine-Mill locals in New Jersey and at
Tottenville, Staten Island, have a few '

serious grievances against the govern-
ment—-and they are pressing for a set-
tlement.

A grievance petition is being circu-
lated by the locals protesting against
the wage-price freeze and proposals for
tax increases. It is addressed to Presi-
dent Truman.

The “grievance” is described this
way: “We feel that the actions listed
below are a violation of Article I of,
our Contract (the Constitution of the
United States), which provides for the
general welfare of the people.

“We feel that the price freeze which
pegged prices at the highest level in
history, and which allows food prices
and rents to continue to go up even
further is unfair to the common people.
We believe prices should be rolled bacli

-to ‘June, 1950.

“We strongly believe that the Wage

not even caught up with the price in-

creases since the end (if the war, and "S
at a time when the corporations are"

bargaining, not by freezes. .» g _
“We can hardly makeends meet now,

and yet new and far heavier cuts in» ‘

and sales taxes are proposed.“ We are ‘ .

The Executive Board of the Interna-

Workers, taking cognizance of this sit-

_m_en_t officials and members of Con-
if gress to enact the following program
for the alleviation of this present in-
tolerable situation:

1. The M-12 ‘Order forbidding use of
‘ copper in some 300 civilian goods
_«.._should.be immediately rescinded and
" replaced with a more sensible ar-
, rangement for the allocation of avail-
 able supplies so as to provide for the
continued employment of workers en-
'gaged in'the ‘production of goods
 ’., needed, by the American consumer.

_' 72. The stockpiling of copper should be
 suspended for at least six months as
" was done in the case ‘of zinc.
7'. The government now carries more
'  refined copper than is to~be found in
the hands of all producers and fabri-
I cators combined.‘-The-gpresent stock-
pile is estimated at about 400,000

‘ BAYARD, N. M.-_—-Members of the
Bayard v Amalgamated Local ‘ 890 are
mighty ‘proud of the fellow-worker who
is leaving them to handle the‘ impor-
tant job of Mine—Mill International-
Representative. \ . ~ , '

He is Arthur Flores, who took a
wage cut of about $100 a_month when
he left his iol§"as "a truck driver for"
Kennecott Copper Co., in order “to ac-
cept the assignment on the Internation-
al Union staff. 

Local 890 members have many good
reasons to be proud of their brother
Flores. Although he is only 32 years

_old,, he has held many posts in the

a union.

Among the jobs he's done for his
union: local representative of the local,
legislative representative at the .state
capitol, delegate to the Kennecott Coun-
oil from Santa Rita open pit, delegate
to Repeal Taft-Hartley Conference in
Washington, member of Local 890 ex-
ecutive board, chairman Santa Rita
unit grievance committee. 0

.. But Flores has not limited his activ-
ity to the’ union. He believes in fight-
ing for the rights of Mexican-Amen
icans both on and off the job. So he
helped organize a chapter of the Aso-
ciacion Nacional Mexicana Americana
here, and is now a county and state
officer of ANMA.

He is a veteran of World War -II,
having spent four years in the navy as
an aircraft metalsmith and metalsmith
instructor. Married, Flores. has two
sons anda two-month old daughter.

Why was he willing to take a wage
cut by going ‘to work on the Interna-
tional Union ‘staff? His answer is
simple. He says he is determined to
help the members build a stronger
Mine-Mill for all workers, and for the
-Mexican-American workers in partic-
ular.

 Mine-Mill members killed

when train hits Sudbury bus

SUDBURY, Ont.—-—Tragedy struck
here early this month when a bus
badly overcrowded with working men,

9 W‘
Word that tragedy had.struck
Local 598 a second time -in Feb-
ruary was received as THE
UNION went to press. Marco
Jalsich, a member of the Local
598 executive board, was acci-
dentally killed at the Creighton
mine. Jalsich was a delegate to
the last two All—Canadian Mine-
Mill conferences. "
\¥ '1
school children and working girls was
struck by a west-bound passenger train
in the nearby smelter town of Conis-
ton.

The majority of the killed and in-
jured were either members or relatives
of members of Mine-Mill Local 598. To
date, the union brothers listed among
the dead are: Eugene Leclair, Herbert
Conlon, Paul Sharko, Primeau Crema,
Dave Martin and Ernie Cooper. A total
of nine are dead, and twenty more are,
still hospitalized, several of them in
critical condition.

The MMSW Int’l Executive Board, in
session at Denver, sent a telegram to
Local 598 saying it had “just learned
details of tragic accident which was so

costly in dead and injured. Members of
Board extend deepest sympathy to be-
reaved families and wishes for early
recovery of those injured.”

Mike Solski, secretary-treasurer of
Local 598, in a statement to THE
UNION, said the “responsibility for the
tragic accident can rest on the shoul-
ders of the company-controlled Conis-
ton town council.” Solski recalled that
when he was a member of the Coniston
council in the perior 1945-1948, he and
a few other councilmen had recom-
mended that a warning signal switch
be erected at the fatal crossing.

“Certain people on ‘that councilwere
more concerned with saving money
than protecting human lives,” Solski
declared. “This should serve as a warn-
ing to the Sudbury district bus com-
paniryi who have turned a deaf ear
towards the workers’ complaints about
the badly overcrowded buses. It is go-
ing to be very hard to convince Conis-
ton people that the cost willibe too high
to put a warning signal switch.”

l The government’s wage freeze was one of the most important sub-
jects discussed by the Mine-Mill International Executive Board during
its meeting February 8-11,. After careful analysis of the freeze, the
Board issued the following statement:

The government’s wage freeze order. is a roadblock in the path of

' millions of wage earners who are feeling the pinch of the highest liv-

ing costs and taxes in Amreican history.

The wage freeze has been put into effect at a time when our union
is holding and scheduling conferences in preparation for our 1951
bargaining drive. Conferences already held reflect a great resentment.
on the part of our members against the high prices and taxes that are
robbing their families. They show a determination to have a larger

share ofwhat they produce—of
the profits now flowing to the
owners of industry at unprece-
dented rates. They reflect a con-
viction that this union must fight

- to maintain its tradition of free

collective bargaining with em.-
ployers in the non-ferrous in-
dustry. -

In order to formulate policy inn

relation to the freeze, we must
seegit as one part of an overall
program to reduce the living
‘standards of‘ working people.

' This has been stated plainly by

the National Wage Stabilization
Board. 
Wage hoard ‘stacked’

The structure of the Board
makes a mockery of its pretense
to represent labor, management

_'_,and ‘-‘the public.” Its chairman
'and chief “public” member, for

instance, is Cyrus Ching of U. S.‘

Rubber Co., who was a manage-
ment rep'resentati've' on the War
Labor Board during World War
II. The so-called “1abor” repre-
sentativeslsigned their names to

.a statement calling for reduced

living standards for workers-a.

. statement of policy upon which

the whole wage-price-tax squeeze
is based. '
Even this stacked board was
not consulted by Director of De-
fense Mobilization Charles E,

I ,Wilson (of General Electric) and

Director of Economic Stabiliza-
tion Eric Johnston (former pres-

_ident of the U. S. Chamber of

Commerce) before they issued
-the wvage freeze order. Such

°7 . authority as the Board may ex-
1 I ercise is limited to what‘ Wilson

and Johnston may choose to
grant.
Sitting as. ‘‘labor’’ representa-

‘tives onlthis Board are men who

have spent much time and money
in efforts to destroy our union.

Unlike wage stabilization in
.WorldvWar II, which permitted
many gains to workers and even

i . ’a slight increase in living stand-
f ards, the present policy, con-
 ceired and executed by Big Busi.

rates of January, 1950-——would,
only put more ice on the freeze.
Our union has already won
higher increases than this ﬁg-
ure. '

0 Even if the Board had the best
of intentions, it has neither the
staff nor the resources to proc-

the wage freeze order to
prevent an employer from
agreeing to wage increases

or other demands, must‘ 

insist on such agreements
before application to the
Wage. Stabilization Board.
Agreement in advance can
go far toward influencing
the Board’s decision.
With complete reliance on
the militant unity of our
membership, as always in
the, past, to achieve our
aims, we r can insure ap-
proval of our agreements

/ once we have securedthem
from -the employer. If and
when, in order to best pro-
tect our members’ interests,
‘it may become necessary
to appear before the Wage
Stabilization Board or any
subsidiary agency, we do
not rely upon technicalities
and legal mumbo-jumbo.
By every means possible
the Board must be im-
pressed with the urgency
and compelling character of
our demands.

a We will not allow the Board
to be used as a pretext for
stalling _by any employer,
nor, as an Iage_nc_y to veto
rightful\gains won by free
collective b__a_rgaining and
the strength of our union.

Finally,’ we cannot surrender
ourleconomic power to enforce
and guarantee our demands. To
do so would be to accept a de-

pression standard of living in a

time of full employment and vast

production and profits. The wage

a freeze is a ro_adblock thrown up

against our drive for a better
standard of living, but it can be

melted down by. the organized

unity and militant activity of
our membership.

We can and must make sub-
stantial gains for our members

Expense of martial law in Idaho

The people of Idaho are expected to
pay illegal warrants contracted by an
irresponsible villian in the pay of the
mine owners association. It is quite

From

evident that Bartlett Sinclair (state '

auditor) and Steunenberg (governor)
are much interested in having the Idaho
legislature allow -these warrants, so
they can get their rakeoff. Sinclair in-
vited Thomas Heney and John Kelly,
members of the legislature from the
Coeur d’Alenes, to come to his room.
Heney and Kelly had been imprisoned

in the bullpen by Sinclair and Steun_en-

berg. Sinclairis proposition to these two
men was that he pay them for the time
they were unjustly incarcerated.

There were"l400’oth,er men "unjustly
incarcerated but Sinclair ‘does not pro-
pose to pay them for the time while
there because they are not members of
the legislature and cannot raise their
voices against him and Steunenberg
and expose their thieving methods dur-
ing their reign in office.

If Sinclair and Steunenberg had suc-
ceeded in sending Heney and Kelly to
the penitentiary they would not offer
to pay them but the people sent them

to the legislature and Sinclair tries to ,

bribe themand there is no law to bring
this criminal to justice.

The mine owners have an organiza-

destroying the Western Federation of
Miners and refusing to give employ-

this they pay a scabnamed Edmiston,

raised a fund of about $1,200 to go to
the relatives of Brothers Morrow and
Saunders who were killed in"‘an auto
accident early in January, ‘and to Louis
Bonacci, the only survivor of the crash.’

Everyone, including the staff, do-
nated a day’s pay to the fund, and the
company added a sizeable donation.

Together with three other refinery r
. "workers, we went down to Provo to find

out what workers at Geneva Steel

‘ think about their union, the CIO Steel-

workers. We didn’t talk to any top of-
ficials or paid organizers, we talked to
ordinarytworking men who were com-
ing out of the ,gate. ~ - A,

We talked to at least 12 or 15 men
between the two of us. Here are some
of the things they told us:

Everybody is dissatisfied over the
way the union won’t handle grievances.
Whenever a man takes up a grievance
he‘ gets a song-and-dance about “having
to go through the channels” and he

finally. ends up with nothing at all.

Almost ‘everyone. we -talked to said
they thought -the Steel union at Geneva
is a company union. Some of the guys‘

said: .“The. C10 is all ri'ght——;as long‘
as you don’t hizve any troubles to take

up’ with them.” ’ That’s just the way.
they said, it. ' L ' 
A couple of ‘men even told us: “You

2 can get more out of u. wildcat walkout
-strike of your own than you can get

NELSON, B. C.—-A wage increase of ‘
13% cents an hour has been won by
Local 901 in bargaining with the K00-
tenay Belle and Cork Province mines.

The l0cal’s bargaining committee
was led by B. C. district president Ken
Smith and included Art Bennett, Ben
Frie, C. A. Short and John Turner ‘or-
Kootenay Belle, and Frank Chidley
and Lloyd Dickie of Cork Province.

They also won a total of six.statu~
tory holidays with pay. The waged in-
crease brings the miner's rate‘ there
to $10.60 a_day. In addition, the con-
tract calls for two weeks’ vacation af-
ter two years of service, and shift dif-
ferentials of 4 to 8 cents.

Another important feature of the
new pact is a contributory life and non-
occupational accident insurance plan,
estimated to represent more than 20
cents an hour.

ficials and told them to get the men 7  .4
back to work. So the men were told S
to go back to work by the union, before‘ ,
they got any satisfaction or settlement B.’
at all. . .v 
Any time anything breaks down in V ' 1.1
the plant, the men on that particular

‘job are either laid off or they are put

back onto lab0rer’s pay. That walkout
of the cranemen happened because the
company punished one of the crane-
men because his crane broke _down. . 
That’s why they walked out, and the - f}- -3:
Steel contract lets the company" do '
that kind of thing, the men told us. , ‘

Something one man told us‘ about  
seniority was this: “If a man wants to  
transfer from one department to some i
other job in a different department, he

9- has to give up all his seniority and .

quit his job. Then, no matter how long.  " 7‘
he’s worked in the plant, he has to.go 1 

through the employment office and hiretj “ 
out as a brand—neW employee. And  51*-

there’s no guarantee after he quits that
the company will hire, him on in thexde-_'

' partment he wants_ to be in.” 1' »

By the way, the starting rateof paygf
at Geneva runs anywhere from-,$10.48,_‘

This isrftisomething we just made 
by ourselves. This is what workers;at7' 
Geneva Steel told us. We’ll be gladlto}
