The Mine-Mill president stated
that the lengthy experience of

industry claim that Bureau of

April Action E xpecfed From Subcommiﬂee

Lee Metcalf Present for
Two—Day March Hearings

WASHINGTON, D.C. -— Having heard last month
from a multitude of witnesses expressing varying degrees
of unhappiness with the federal mine safety bill passed
by the House of Representatives last year, the nine-man
Senate Subcommittee on Labor is expected to meet during
the latter part of April to decide which version of the
legislation it will recommend. Any bill favorably acted
upon would then go to the full Committee on Labor and
Public Welfare before reaching the floor for a vote.

Not unexpectedly, since the House-passed measure
is a compromise version, the March 21 and 22 subcommit-
tee hearings produced a wide range of opinions on what

is wrong with that bill.

Industry spokesmen indicated that they still are out
to kill any and all federal safety legislation to cover the

non-ferrous m et a l s industry.
Mine-Mill International Presi-
dent A. C. Skinner and other
representatives of organized ‘la-
bor spoke in favor of several
strengthening amendments, fo-
cusing primarily on the need
to delete a provision in the
House-passed bill which would
allow ‘state administration of
approved safety plans. Other
proposals are for an extension
of enforcement powers to en-
sure compliance with all safety
code provisions and for a broad-

Skinner Hits Companies in Testimony
Before Senate Subcommttee on Labor

WASHINGTON, D.C.——Mine-Mill International President A. C. Skinner on March 21 strongly urged the
Senate Subcommittee on Labor to substantially amend a House-passed federal mine safety bill for the non-ferrous
metals industry, as the group’s two-day hearings on the subject got underway.
_ Resting his case primarily on a wealth of testimony presented at House hearings in 1956, 1957, 1961, and

-last year and on a two-year study of" safety conditions in the industry carried out by the Department of the In-
terior, Skinner called for a broadening of coverage to include smelters and refineries and an extension of enforce-
‘ - ‘ment powers so that compliance with all safety code provisions might better be ensured. He urged, too, the deletion
of a’ provision in the House-passed bill which would allow state administration of approved safety plans, maintaining

Third Recent Death
At Galena 6:. Page

WALLACE, Idaho—-—The victim of a blasting accident
at AS&R’s Galena mine on the afternoon of March 15,
Philip Walker, 30, died some four hours later in the hos-
pital here. His death was the second at the mine in six
weeks, an-d he was the third member of Mine-Mill Local
18 killed on the job in a period of seven months.

Walker and his partner Gordon Allen, who escaped

injury, apparently were preparing for blasting operations.

in the mine when the accident occurred. The state mine

inspector’s office investigated,
but its report was not available
at press time for this issue.

Previous Accidents

Only.-six weeks previously, on
Feb. 3, Donald Jutila, 2, was
killed at Galena when a huge
slab slid from the hanging wall
of a stope and hit him. On Aug.
18, Eli Beachel, 35, years old,
slipped and fell 165' feet to his
death in the Page mine here,

also a property operated by the’

American Smelting and Refin-
ing Company. The latter acci-
dent occurred in the 211 raise of
the mine, where repair work
had been discontinued to allow
the: -stope on the right side of
the raise to be worked.

Vanner J. Hegbloom, deputy
state mine inspector, who in-
vestigated the August fatality,
recommended the installation
of a hinged grating at stope

level in this type of raise, over’

 

the timber slide. Following his
probe of the February accident,
Inspector of Mines 0. T. Hansen
urged that “barring down be
done all during the shift, to re-
move hazards which may de-
velop because of the removal
of the muck, the loosening of
the walls through airslacking,
and slusher jarring.”

The U. S. Bureau of Mines al-
so is investigating the most re-
cent fatality.

Walker, who first joined Mine-
Mill while working at the old
Frisco mine in 1955, worked for
AS&R off and on since 1959,
and had been at the Galena
mine since last June.

Born on June 8, 1935 in Mul-
lan, he attended schools there
prior to spending four years in
the U. S. Air Force. He married

THE‘ MINE‘-MILL UNION

pholds 1965 Act;

(.4

;ns ade

The U. S. Supreme Court early last month rule-d unanimously that key pro-
visions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which nullify literacy tests in six Southern
states and authorize federal examiners to register Negroes to vote, are constitutional.
South Carolina, joined by five other Southern states, had challenged the newlaw.

Chief Justice Earl Warren, who recently celebrated his 75th birthday, wrote
the opinion, in which he said, “Hopefully, millions of non-white Americans will now be
able to participate for the first time on an equal basis in the government under

which they live.”

In other developments in the civilrights area, two. separate ‘ three-judge fed-
eral courts struck down state poll taxes in Texas and Alabama—-two of four states

which retain such taxes. The
others are Virginia and Missis-
sippi; Poll taxes for voting in
federal elections have been out-
lawed for the past two years.
The three-judge court in the
Texas case was unanimous in
its decision, while the panel in

“the Alabama case split, 2 to 1.

The Supreme Court will be

asked to speak on the issue,

however, and while the appeals
are still being considered, the
state poll taxes may be re-
quired for elections held during
the period.

- Meeting in special session, the
Texas legislature passed a voter
registration law, backed by Gov.
John Connally, which requires
“affirmative action” to become
a qualified voter. Although it
will substitute for the poll tax
only when, and if, the Supreme
Court upholds the lower courts
on the subject, during a 15-day
‘emergency registration period

.last month, potential voters

could register for free at various
locations "or - by mailing in
special forms.

Several legisl__ators had fought
to liberalize the bill by allowing
a voter to re-register merely by

— voting once every two years and

by providing that election dep-
uties could go out seeking regis-
trants. U. S. Sen.l,Ralp_h Yar-_
borough of Texas supports this
plan. ’ ’ -
Election invalidated

In still another case involving
voting, the_ U. S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Fifth Circuit, at
New Orleans, threw out the
1965 municipal elections of Sun-
ﬂower, Miss, because Negroes
had‘ been excluded. Sunﬂower is-
the -home of Sen. James 0. East-

* land, a rabid segregationist.

The first such court decision,
it. lends important support to
last year's Voting Rights Act.

‘ Since the Fifth Circuit appeals

court exercises jurisdiction over
all of the Deep South, the de-
cision means that Negroes now

can block any future elections '

there where substantial numbers
of their race have been denied
the right to vote becauseof dis-
crimination.

Judge John R. Brown wrote
the opinion for the unanimous

three-judge panel. Arrangements.

must now be made for a new
election in Sunflower.

School Integration

Elsewhere on the integration
front, the U. S. Office of Edu-
cation has indicated that it will
attempt to triple the number of
Negroes in the South’s predomi-
nantly white schools by next
fall. For the first time, accept-
able percentages of desegrega-
tion are being established for
Southern school districts. At the
present time, only about six per-
cent of the South’s 3,000,000
Negro students attend schools
with whites.

The Civil Rights Commission,

too, recently urged the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and
Welfare to cut off funds to many
federally aided welfare pro-

, grams in the South to help end

widespread discrimination in
hospital and health services.

 ISVERY LITTLE possibility that the government will
 be doing anything in the - immediate future to tighten the
operations of the employer-run pension plans. Beginning with
D6c_gmb'er,31, ofthis year, the Labor Department will require more
infgirmation ‘on the "annual reports. The recommendations of the

 ..AileqIiat.-yd of Pension Funding May Small Coal Mines Safety iBih"
Passed, Ending Long Struggle    

WASHINGTON, D. C.——An eight-year battle to extend mandatory federal coal
mine safety provisions to small mines employing 14 or fewer workers ended on March
14 when the Senate approved such an extension by voice vote. There was some opposi-
tion to the bill, which cleared the House la st June by a 355 to 43 margin.

Sen. Wayne Morse (D-Ore.) was the floor manager for the bill, which had-the

backing of the Johnson administration.

“The need -.-for this legislation is evident from an examination of fatality statistics I

in underground coal mines,”
stressed Morse, pointing out
that of 255 U.S. coal mine
deaths last year, 63 occurred in
the small mines.
UMWA Victory

Some 6,500 to 7,000‘ small
mines will be brought under
federal safety standards as a
result of the legislation, which
was strongly pushed over the
years by the United Mine Work-
ers of America, with the sup-
port of other labor organizations
including Mine-Mill. The some
1,000 larger ‘coal mines in the
country, employing 15 or more
workers, have been covered for
many years.

The bill, favorably reported
by the Senate Labor and Public
Welfare Committee on March
4, gives the U.S. Bureau of

Mines the authority to close

those small mines where acci-
dents may be imminent. The
mines will have six months to
meet the federal safety stan-
dards where present violations
present no immediate danger.

“Unwarrantable failure” by
mine operators, however, to
comply within 90 days with or-
ders to correct violations that
could lead to accidents also now
may result in closing of the
properties. Mine closings may
be appealed to the review board
and the courts.

Other Provisions

The bill also includes provi-
sions strengthening federal-state
cooperation on safety enforce-
ment, authorizing annual feder-
al grants of $500,000 (to be
matched by the states) for coal
mine safety education pro-
grams, and directing the Secre-
tary of the Interior to explain.

Sens. Jennings Randolph (D-

and Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) took
the floor to urge passage of the
measure, which was opposed by
Sens. John Cooper (R-Ky.) and
Thruston Morton (R-Ky.).

The measure’s opponents, stat-
ing that state safety regulations
were sufficient, also claimed
that the increased costs of com-
pliance with federal standards
might drive many of the small
mines operators out of busi-
ness.

of great help in our own cam-

Copper#iideas.e
Hoped to Block
Price Increase

In a move that apparently
took the industry by surprise,
the federal government moved
into the copper situation in late

March with a directive from.

President Johnson ordering the

release of an additional 200,000 *-

tons of copper from the national
stockpile. The r  to be
made in several disposal sales,
will reduce the stockpile to a
total of 409,000 tons.

The President's order stipu-
lates that the government re-
tains an option to buy back cop-
per for the stockpile at the

 

present producer price of 36.

cents per pound, or at any low-
er prevailing price if necessary.
Long-term purchase contracts
will be negotiated_by' the Gen-
eral S e r v i c e s Administration
and will specify that purchase
orders must be met from addi-
tional p r o d u c ti o n. Industry

_ sources point out, however, that

it is unlikely that new stockpile
purchases can be supplied for
about the next three years.

In other actions taken at the I

same time, the President called
for all government agencies to
substitute other metals for cop-

per where possible. He directed -
that all necessary steps be tak- L

en to expand domestic produc-

tion through special incentives : i '

—such as expansion loans—and
ordered that all possible steps

be taken to speed delivery to -- =

the copper industry of excavat-
ing and refining machinery.

The President's action is ex- ‘_
pected to ease the tight supply;

situation that fabricators have

been facing- and to reduce pres- ’

sure for an increase in the pro-

ducer price of copper. However, A

trade sources do not anticipate

that any new production can be 1 -

significantly speeded up. i

THE MINE-MILL UNION

April. 1766-

 

Reports Gicven on N.M.
Strike, Rainbow Petition

LOS ANGELES, Calif.—-With pension negotiations
with the American Smelting and Refining Company due
to get underway in late May or early Ju11e, the Mine-
Mill AS&R Council met at the Chapman Park Hotel here
on March 11 and 12 to put the finishing touches on its
list of proposals with which to confront the company.

The coming bargaining sessions “are extremely im-
portant, not only to AS&R workers, but to those through-
out the entire industry.” noted International Secretary
Treasurer Irving Dichter, the council coordinator, in open-
ing the two-day parley. Since most major chains will not
get into pension negotiations until next year, he said,

the AS&R workers have the
crucial responsibility of ensur-
ing that significant break-
throughs are achieved in what
well could be a . pattern-setting
agreement. _ «

Delegates to the conference
approved a few. additions and
amendments, but by and large
accepted the pension proposals
adopted at last year’s interna-

tional convention and later ex-

panded by the union’s execu-
tive board-a program, said
Dichter, that represents the
“best considered judgmen ” of
the rank-and-file leadership and
elected officials of the union.

5.000 Represented

The some 20 delegates who
attended the -meeting, represent-
ing 14 AS&R properties around
the country where approximate-
ly 5,000 workers are employed,
heard too that anelection peti-
tion has been filed at the com-
pany’s new Rainbow. mine in
the Coeur d’Alene district in
Idaho. Quentin (Doc) Weichel
and Walter F. Scott, delegates
from Local 18, and International
Representative Lew C o c h r a 11
agreed that, although only 28
men are working now on the
shaft-sinking, the mine eventu-
ally will employ more thanthe
company’s Galena property
with 160 men.

S. Q. (Chano) Merino, presi-
dent of Local 890‘ in Bayard,
N.M., and Alfredo Montoya, in-
ternational representative, re-
ported on the status of the
Ground Hog strike, stating that
the company has yet to revise
its offer of last July for Wages
that are from 80 cents to a dol-
lar per hour below those being

paid to other workers through-‘

out the AS&R chain. -Health
and welfare and other fringe

p e n s i 0 n improvements “long
overdue.” ‘

The AS&R pension program
expires this June 30, with the
rest of ‘the contract not opening
until 1967. -Another council de-
mand is that in the future pen-
sion plans run concurrently
with the contract bargaining
agreements.

Amendment-s Passed ’

Insurance consultant Paul
Pinsky presented to the dele-
gates the proposed pension pro»
gram emerging ‘from discus-
sions at the international con-

vention ‘last .year -and the re-
-cent executive board meeting.
. Among the amendments adopt-
ed by the-,AS&R Council were

provisions that _ any cost-of-liv-
ing adjustment should not cause

-the benefit to go below $5.50

per month; that normal retire-
ment come. after 25, rather than
30, years of service; that health
and welfare coverage for pen-
sioners be raised in this year’s
bargaining; that -the agreement
reached this year be retroactive
to July 1 whatever the date of
settlement. -

It was agreed that Pinsky

Tire SafetY Bill Follows  

Harassment of Auto Critic

Ralph Nader’s book, published
by New York’s Grossman Pub-

. lishers, Inc_., ..is called ..“Unsafo.
At Any Speed.” - In it, the

author, a ' young Washington
lawyer, who last summer served
as an adviser to a Senate sub-
committee investigating auto-

motive -safety," maintains that"
auto safety takes a back seat

to styling, .—comfort, power,

 speed; and «the. auto makers’. de-

sire to cut costs.

On March 22, James M.
Roche, president of General
Motors, testifying before a sub-

-committee chaired .by Sen.

Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn.),
apologized for any part his firm

may have had in the private-

eye harassment of Nader, a for-
mer consultant to the U.S. De-
partment of Labor’s office of
policy planning and research.
“I am not here,” said Roche,

“to excuse, condone or justify,
-‘ in ‘anyway our investigation.”

Nader earlier had told the
same subcommittee that since
his book was published, he had
been followed and that private
detectives had been quizzing his
acquaintances about whether or

.not his sex life was normal

and ,if he had any connections
with left-wing groups. He dis-
cussed, too, the strange ap-
proaches by a couple of attrac-
tive women, but Roche dis-
claimed any GM responsibility
for “sex lures.”

The GM president, however,

had been particularly critical of 
their safety design in his book-. 
Conceding 4 that the -auto .1 ;manu- 
facturers spend an estimated $5 
million a year on safety re-' _7

search, Nader charges that

most of it is mlsspent on pro- v

grams to educate and exhort

the driver, rather than on‘pro-"1 
iducing ‘ safer" -vehicles. .
A -In -his book-,—.»the -~32-year-oldw 
~author .also'=states that th'e;Pre's--—.~-' ‘

ident’s Committee for Traffic
Safety is little more than a
private interest group running
a public agency and speaking.
with the authority of the Presi-
dent. What he terms the “Traf-

fice Safety Establishment,”_

comprised of the Detroit auto

makers, Akron’s tire manufac-’ 

turers, and such trade groups
as the National Safety Council
and the American Automobile
Association, has as its chief

purpose, Nader cha-rges, “to see‘ _ ’ '
that the federal government j

stays out of traffic safety and -*'~< ‘
that the entrenched view‘ _.of‘, 

accidents and injuries as being_

due to driver behavior is not I

disturbed.” . - - -
On March 29-—one week after

Roche’s testimony, the Senate.-_ ..

passed by a 79 to 0 count a tire
safety bill which authorizes the
Secretary of Commerce to adopt
minimum safety standards for
new car tires on or before next ‘
Jan. 31. The bill, sponsored by
Sen. Warren G. Magnuson (D-
Wash.), also calls upon ’the

Bureau been allowed to investi-
gate fatal accidents.

Pointing to the vocal support
given by the industry to the Bu-
reau of Mines’ safety training
program, Skinner maintained
that, in practice, the companies
have displayed “a vast indiffer-
ence to this important activity.”
Of 241 companies solicited to
participate in training classes
for production and maintenance
workers, he said, less than 30
percent accepted and just over
10 percent actually scheduled
and completed the classes.

Many Loopholes

Finally, the Mine-Mill presi-
dent challenged at length the
industry contention that it has
played a role in strengthening
state mine safety laws. Declar-
ing that “we are at the end of
the road as far as getting ade-
quate and meaningful improve-
ments at the state level are
concerned,” Skinner pointed to
safety code revisions in Utah
and Montana which still provid-
ed no standard for atmospheric
concentration of silica dust. In
Utah, he maintained, a loophole
on permissible concentrations of
radon gas allowed “nearly two-
thirds of the uranium miners in
the state to work in environ-

ments with up to ten times and’

more the permissible concentra-
tions established by the Ameri-
can Standards Association.”

Another loophole-—this one in-
volving the need for more than
one escapeway to a mine--“may
well have been the direct cause
of the death of six of the 18 vic-
tims” of a mine explosion near
Moab, Utah in 1963, Skinner
said.

Mentioning similar frustrating
experiences in achieving ade-
quate state codes in Arizona
and Idaho, Skinner charged that
the industry opposition to fed-
eral safety legislation “is based,
in the final analysis, upon cost
considerations.” “In our experi-
ence, minor adjustments are
made,” he said, “but resistance
develops and remains where
substantial expense is involved.”

In support of his proposal to
extend federal safety legislation
to smelters and refineries, Skin-
ner offered an account, which
recently came to light, of an
entire mining ‘community being
dusted with arsenic trioxide as
the result of faulty dust collec-
tion at a gold smelter. Workers
and members of their families
became ill because of the
months-long exposure, which
killed the entire cat population
and all but one dog in the com-
munity.

Stuart. Terrill Attend

Skinner was accompanied dur-
lng his appearance before the
Senate subcommittee by Mine-
Mill Research Director Arthur
Stuart and International Repre-
sentative Leo Terrill, who has
been assigned to Washington for
the remainder of the campaign
for federal mine safety legisla-
tion.

Further excerpts from Skin-
ner’s presentation are reprinted
below:

“It is our feeling that smel-
ters and refineries should be in-
cluded in the coverage of the
legislation before you. Testi-
mony presented by my union
at the House subcommittee
hearings last May indicated the
virtual lack of any coverage of
such establishments in the safe-
ty laws and codes of most of
the western states, or of any
effective inspection or enforce-
ment machinery. The U. S. Bu-
reau of Mines is well equipped
to undertake this responsibility
in an activity closely related to
mining. It has conducted safety‘
education and training in smel-
ters and refineries “for many

«years. It has prepared excellent
— 2;-— -' safety zm-annals -...~fo'r1»such*". plants,
'~ I.‘ 

and :=-it.-zh as: zcolle cted~'injury ~"sta'-‘

 

tistics from such plants.”

“We wish to endorse and urge
retention of the present lan-
guage of Section 4 requiring an-
nual inspection of underground
mines subject to the act. We
do not believe that reliance can
be placed on reports of mine
accidents or frequency and se-
verity
them to provide an infallible
guide as to where inspection ef-
forts should be concentrated.
Cases in point could be cited,
such as ga_ssy mines which
might have ' comparatively good
rates until a disaster struck in
the form of an explosion. More-
over, disabilities due to silica
dust and radon gas do not show
up until a period of years after
exposure, so no reporting sys-
tem could be expected to cur-
rently indicate sound or unsound
safety practices withrespect to
these hazards. We therefore be-
lieve the proposed minimum re-
qui1'ement of annual inspections
is most necessary and de-
sirable.”

Mandatory Standards
“We regard the present Sub-
section 6 (b) as a very consider-
able improvement over the orig-

 

Sen. Gaylord Nelson

inal language which appeared
as Subsection 5 (b) of HR 6961,
which would authorize the Sec-
retary of the Interior to desig-
nate as mandatory standards
only those dealing with major
hazards. Only a small propor-
tion of all accidents are caused
by major hazards, as the term
is understood by the Interior
Department. As nowwritten in
HR 8989, Section 6 (b) provides
that the Secretary of the Inte-

I rior shall designate as manda-

tory standards those which deal
with conditions or practices
which could cause death or seri-
ous physical harm. While this is
high-ly preferable to the narrow
concept of mandatory standards
expressed in HR 6961, it does

.not meet a recommendation

subcommittee hearings last May

   

rates calculated from’

 

Sen. Lee Metcalf
(Dem.-Montana)

when I said, ‘We also believe
that enforcement powers should
be broadly extended so that
compliance with all safety code
provisions may be assured.’
“The concept that certain
standards shall be mandatory
and others. optional,‘ opens -up. a
Pandora’s box for the Secretary
of the Interior and his advisory
committees. Every standard
would have to be examined * to
determine whether it dealt with
conditions or practices which
could cause death or serious
physical harm. I can imagine
a continuous tug of war between
management and union repre-
sentatives on the advisory com-
mittees provided for in Section
7, with management representa-
tives trying to limit the number '

‘ of standards to be designated as

mandatory.

“We regard the distinction be-
tween mandatory and optional
standards to be inconsistent
with Section 6 (a) which directs
the Secretary of the Interior to
‘promulgate health and safety
standards for the purpose of the
protection of life, the promotion
of health and safety, and the
prevention of accidents.’ ”

>i4 IE3 ii!

“The concept of mandatory
versus optional standards is an
unfortunate one. It is not pres-
ent in S 996 which calls for en-
forcement of all federal mine"
safety code provisions. It is not
present in the code promulgated
under the safety amendments to
the Federal Longshoremen’s and
Harbor Workers’ Compensation
Act. The concept of mandatory
and optional provisions grew up .
in the evolution of the Federal
Coal Mine Safety Act.and was-
criticized in a trenchanti state'- ‘
ment by President Truman
when in 1952 he signed S 1310,
now known as Title II of that
act. Referring to the mandatory
provisions of Title II he said:
‘The provisions of the legisla-
tion are directed solely toward

' the prevention of major ’disas- ,-
ters fromithe five causes men-
tioned heretofore. 'Such - di‘sas- 

ters. accounted. for" only approxi-.‘
mately seven percent of the
coal mine fatalities during the
past 20 years. The broad phase

eral remains the responsibility
of the states in which coal is
mined, despite the record to
date indicating either the inabil-

.. ity. or unwillingness "of therstates '

to -meet this. :responsibility.’.
“We believe that Congress’
should enact a broad gauge
mine safety bill which does not
limit the enforcement powers

of the Secretary of the Interior.” ,

“Why is a Federal safety pro-
gram for metal and non-metal
mines vitally needed? We have
had more than 50 years’-experi-
ence with state responsibility in
this field. The record is now
very clear that all states have
failed to give this problem of
mine safety the consideration it
warrants. We have inadequate
and antiquated state mine safe-
ty laws, state mine safety codes
all too often as full of loopholes
as a sieve, inadequate state ap-
propriations for inspection, and
lax or nonexistent use of the
limited enforcement authority
granted to state mine inspectors.
The record will show that years
of struggle to improve state

mine safety laws and codes, to‘
increase appropriations, ‘con- ,

tinue to meet with frustration

State Option

?‘The"House-passed bill was
also amended to provide for
state inspection and enforce-
ment of safety regulations in
those states that wished to un-
dertake the job. State safety
plans and enforcement proce-
dures would be subject to the
approval of the Secretary of the
Interiorbefore going into effect.

“I believe that a uniform
safety and health code estab-
lished and enforced by the Bu-
reau of Mines is preferable to
this state option. . . . For the

record of state enforcement of
safety regulations had not been
a good one. And the difficulties
in enforcing safety regulations

 

are complicated when there are C

different standards and varying
levels of enforcement from state
to‘ state.

“Mining, after all, is an inter-

state industry today. The com-.
panies. operating most of .the-

mines are located in morethan

one state. As -prudent managers’.
of their capital, they invest their 3

money in new shafts, ' tunnels

and pits inthose states where,

they will get the greatest re-
turn. If safety and health reg-
ulations cost more in one state
than they do in the next, the
operator will open his new shaft
where the costs are less. And

state ‘ inspection and enforce- "

‘ ment agencies, under pressure
to hold and attract industry to

' their states, cannot do the job‘

they -would like to do. It is par-
ticularlyimportant not to make
safety and 'health"a part of the
cost equation for mining opera-
tions. I believe that the state
option included in Section 13
would do this.” x '

Other Statements

All three will file statements
in support of federal safety leg-
islation with the subcommittee
before it acts. Others expected
to do the same include Sen.
Eugene McCarthy (D-Minn.)
and Reps. Frank Clark (D-Pa.),
James G. Fulton (R-Pa.), and
Arnold Olsen (D-Mont.). Metcalf
sat in with the subcommittee
throughout the two-day hearings,

while Moss joined the group on -

several occasions to listen to the
testimony.
In both his oral presentation

. to the subcommittee on March

21 and a more detailed written

submission, Skinner ieroed in
on severaleof the maJor claims

advanced by the mining com-
panies at the House hearings

’ last May—and ‘repeated - on the
-second day of the Senate hear-

ings-—as to why they oppose fed- *

eral legislation in this area.
Charging that the companies
“wish to permanently relegate
the U.S. Bureau of Mines to the
role they prefer for it-—a tooth-
less agency confined to such
peripheral and harmless activi-
ties as research and health and
safety training,” he maintained
that Mine-Mill’s long experience
with the companies in practice
flatly contradicts many of the
statements made by the indus-
try’s spokesmen.

Other representatives of or-
ganized labor appearing at the
hearings were Sidney Zagri,
legislative director for the
Teamsters Union, who stressed
the many shortcomings of the
state-option provision in the
House-passed measure and
urged its elimination, and
Frank N. Hoffmann and Orville
Larson of the ’ Steelworkers.

-Other labor groups expected to

file statements calling, for
strengthening amendments to
the House-passed bill are the
national AFL-CIO’s legislative
department, the Oil, Chemical,

United Mine Workers of Ameri-
ca, the International Chemical

‘ Secretary Udall,‘ the first wit-

ness at the hearings, in speak-

ing in support of the original"
administration bill, pointed to’

the “wide variations in the
comprehensiveness and quality
of both company V and state

A fourth government witness
was Henry N. Doyle, assistant

and the frequency of lung can-
cer among uranium miners.
Closely questioning the ad-

. Trial Examiner Rules Against UMWA

An 80-cents per ton royalty payment on coal from non-union
sources, payable by organized operators who bought the coal for
resale, was declared illegal by an NLRB trial examiner.

This is the second method tried by the United Mine Workers to
bring non-union operators into line with the rest of the industry.
Originally, a contract provision prohibited organized operators
from handling coal from non-union producers. This provision was
declared illegal by the NLRB in 1963, and was replaced by the
penalty payment. (Regular royalty payment, used to fund the
miners’ pension and welfare programs, is 40 cents per ton, payable
on each ton produced by unionized operations.)

The examincr’s ruling on the penalty payment is subject to
review by the full National Labor Relations Board.

- Minimum Wage Bill to House Floor

The House Labor Committee has approved for ﬂoor action a

5 bill to increase the current minimum wage of $1.25 per hour and

include some now-exempt workers in its coverage. The bill pro-
vides that the minimum will go up to $1.40 per hour in February,
1966 and to $1.60 in February, 1968. An estimated 3.8 million work-

," ,ers‘ would be in line for the $1.40 rate in 1966 and about 6 million
5, for the $1.60 minimum in 1968.

Farm workers, if employed by a farmer with seven or more
employees, would get only $1 an hour minimum next February,

7 » $1.15 later in 1967, and a top of $1.30. in 1968. Other newly covered
‘ workers-—including retail trade employees, hospital, construction,

laundry, dry cleaning, restaurant, hotel and motel workers-

 would get a $1 minimum in 1966 and go up to $1.60 in four annual
{ W steps of 15 cents each.

Some loopholes have been tightened in coverage of farm pro-

 duction workers, agricultural processing, logging, and seasonal
,» workers.

Remember—New Insecticides  
Require Extreme Precautions 

Late last year, the Federal Committee on Pest Control announced a comprehensive program

to'try to determine the effects of pesticides on man, animals and plants used for food, soil and_

water. Included in the study, to be carried out by the Public Health Service, the Fish and Wild-

life Service, the Food and Drug Administration, and other government agencies, were to be tests.-

for the levels of pesticide residues.

While no one knows how many pesticides, on a longterm basis, affects the human brain, I

liver, kidneys, or other organs, it is known that residues of such pesticides as DDT are to be found

in most American rivers, in fish, birds, and mammals, including man. ..
Americans, who used 350 million pounds of insecticides in a recent year, have some 100 to‘

200 milligrams of DDT in their

systems—-six times as much as
the average Englishman or
German. _

DDT, which is one of the
group of pesticides called chlor-
inated hydrocarbons, is potent
and remains in an active state

for a long time. Yet its use is
far less dangerous than a new
group of insecticides, which,
used without extreme caution,
have resulted in violent illness
and even death.

Skinner Answers Rocky

(Reproduced below is the lead editorial from the Sat", Feb. 26‘
edition of the Rocky Mountain News, a Scripps-Howard newspaper
in Denver. In stating the position taken by the editorial, the news-

" -paper is far from alone. In an attempt to refute the claims of the

editorial and to fill in some crucial facts that were omitted, Mine-

are greedy; that President Johnson has put pressure on big business

' as ;“g'uidelines.”

Your editorial makes no attempt to tell the whole story. about

.“guidelines,” wage increases, prices, and profits. It puts only a

few pieces of information together. It is carefully calculated to
arrive at the conclusion that inﬂation can only be caused by
“greedy union leaders.” This is not surprising in view of your
consistent editorial position on unions.

First, you need to explain where the so-called “guidelines”
came, from. As you know, they -were first developed in 1962 when
J ohn. Kennedy was President. The President’s Council of Economic
Advisors in 1962 determined that productivity—or; production per
man hour—was increasing an-
nually at the rate of 3.2 percent.
This calculation, therefore, justi-
fied in their view the opinion
that wage increases be limited
annually to this same rate. In
other words, working people
were only entitled to wage in--
creases as their productivity in-
creased. This means if you want
wage increases you must work
faster. '

They can tell you.

Any trade union leader worth
his salt must work hard for the

represents. He must continually

he is contributing to a better

A; Hazard With Tubeless Tires

The April issue of CONSUMER REPORTS points ‘out that
the valve stems of tubeless tires are likely to deteriorate with age.
They should bechecked periodically to make sure they are secure
and undamaged. Since they can be replaced only when the tire
is off, the best time to replace doubtful ones is when new tires are
installed. Valve stems cost less than $1 each.

What to Look for in l 
Water-Repellent Topcoais

Water-repellent topcoats tend to look very much alike. But in
tests of 21 models priced from $23 to $55, Consumers Union found
significant unseen differences. The results of the tests are car-
ried in the April issue of CONSUMER REPORTS.

CU was disappointed to find that not one coat tested this time
approaches the check-rated quality found in 5 models tested in 1962.
No coat in the current tests was judged better than good in water
repellency and a few retained good repellency after dry cleaning
or washing. -

None of the tests revealed any label-reading, guidelines that
would help you find superior repellency. "The labels of most of the
coats indicated they were made of a polyester-cotton fiber mixture;
these models ranged in repellency from good to poor. The 100%
cotton coats also were -varied in repellency. Nor did the test-re-
sults. consistently single out for particular acclaim any of the trade-
named repellency finishes’ featured on many labels.

The tests indicated that each cleaning of a coat, whether by
dry cleaning or laundering, will leave the coat at least a little less
water-repellent than it originally was. Sooner or later every coat
will have to be reproofed, and from then on, reproofing will have
to accompany each subsequent dry cleaning and probably even

. laundering. » .

As a result.of.the.laboratory ﬁndings, CONSUMER REPORTS
suggests that if you launder a coat, you wash it gently in warm
but not hot water; rinse it thoroughly (three clear-water cycles
are recommended); don’t leave it in the machine for the spin
cycle or run it through a wringer; either tumble-dry itor drip-dry
it; and iron it carefully to improve appearance and probably repel-
lency as well. It's also a good rule towash dark things with dark

and light things with light. CU advises against cleaning a water-

repellent topcoat in a coin-"operated dry cleaning ‘machine, ‘since
it cannot be /expected to give an adequate rinse. *

On the plus side CU found shrinkage of no consequence in any
of the coats tested. Every coat was able to keep its color at least
reasonably well and could be trusted not to transfer noticeable
amounts of dye‘ onto clothing or upholstery -‘it might rub against.
A series of fabric strength tests gave assurance that each of the
tested coats was manufactured of at least"-adequately strong ma-
terial. .- . . " ‘

Here is a summary of other points to look for: - ' . I

1. A lining, is essential around the top of the raincoat. For
extra dryness, a .1ining made of outer fabric has a slight‘
edge.

2. If you buy a coat with a zip or button in lining, check wheth-
or it requires any special laundering and try the coat on
with and without the lining while wearing the heaviest
clothing you expect to use underneath it. A

3. Interlining, at the sleeve ends and along the button and
buttonhole edges is essential and usually found. Extension
of the interlining from the facings on across the breast helps
keep the coatfront looking neat and smooth. _

4. Don’t get a coat with tangled threads, loose stitches,
crooked seams or poorly finished buttonholes.

5. Check for length. CU’s test coats (all 38 regulars) varied by
a good three inches.

6. Check that lapels button up for wet weather protection. A L

knee tab and button across the front near the bottom of the
coat gives added protection—four buttons offer an advantage
over three-button models.

7. A slit or vent that divides the back into two tails is undesir-
able. If the coat you select has one, make sure it has at’
least an inch of overlap and preferably a button to keep it
closed. . .

As CU’s.tests so often reveal, price is no. guide to performance.

-~_'?._:'.F

While the model with the lowest suggested retail price ($22.25) '

did turn up near the bottom of CU’s Ratings, the tests revealed

that you don't need to go to the top of the price range ($55) to get i A

top performance characteristics.
in price from $35 to $29.95.

How to Compare Fertilizer Costs

The ingredients in fertilizers varygreatly. As a result, you
can’t compare fertilizer cost by package size and price alone. In
the April issue of CONSUMER REPORTS, Consumers Union
recommends that you first look in your phone book for your county
agricultural agent,_usually found either under the name of your
county or under U. S. Government, Department of Agriculture.

Ask the county agent to analyze a soil sample from your lawn.
This service is usually free or -

for lime ‘and fertilizer" needs.
available at modest cost.

After the agent has helped you ‘narrow’ down the nutrient ratio‘
your soil needs, the best way to compare costs is on a basis of
price per pound of nitrogen, the most important nutrient.

Three usually prominent figures on the bag will give the nitro-

gen, phosphorous and potassium percentages in that order--23-7-7.

or '5-4-0, for example. A 20-10-0 fertilizer has the same ratio of

Those rated in the top six ranged

primary nutrients (2-1-1) as a 10-5-5 product, but you would have '

to spread twice as much of the latter to get the same results.

Here’s how. CONSUMER REPORTS says to arrive at the price -
-;per pound. of the nitrogen content:-. “Convert the nitrogen perce_nt- »
Sage into pounds by multiplying th_ew_eight of the bag by its per-_ ;.
centage of. nitrogen’ (as stated on the label) and dividing by 100. «

Then divide the.price of the package by the number of pounds of
nitrogen in the bag. Here’s an example: A 22—pound bag of 12-6-6,
fertilizer is priced at $3.50. Thus, 22 lb. x 12 (the nitrogen per-
centage is always the first number)-:--100=2.64 lb. of nitrogen;

$3.50—-:---'2'.64=$1.33 for fertilizer containing one pound of nitrogen. 

In comparison, a 25-pound bag of 20-10-10 fertilizer is priced at
$4.95. Thus, 25 lb. x20+100=5 lb. of nitrogen; $4.95~:~5:=99c—34c
less for fertilizer containing one pound of nitrogen,”—-a saving of
25%.‘ ‘

~: -«Over. the-range. of t fertilizers‘ listed, CU found that the cost of 3   
some fe_rtilizers_ would be more«.than.three times the cost of ‘others.

upon rigged and evasive report-
ing of disabling mine accidents
and occupational diseases. Un-
counted thousands of disabling
injuries go unreported every
year as companies use every
ingenious device to hold down
their accident frequency and
severity rates.

“The dodges the companies
use include placing injured men
on vacation, classiﬁcation of
work injuries as non-Work con-
nected illness, or injuries, wide-
spread non-reporting of occupa-
tional disease, and transporta-
tion of men with arms and legs

clocking in and out and resting
on the company premises dur-

of these devious practices ap-
pears in the record of th.e House
Subcommittee hearings last

Must Go Much Farther

“The companies plaster the
‘plant gates with safety posters
emphasizing the importance of
wearing safety hats, safety gog-
gles, safety shoes, and exhort-
ing their employees to be ‘safe-
ty . conscious.’ No one would
-deny the virtue of observing
these practices, but safety pro-
grams should go much farther
than publicity which, in effect,
emphasizes the individual em-
ployee’s responsibility for his
own safety, to the exclusion of
the deeper and more important
responsibility of the companies
to provide, so far as it possible,
a safe and healthful work en-
vironment.

“The companies under con-

_ tract with this and other unions
have been forced in most cases
to grant recognition to union
safety committees in their labor-
management agreements. They

meet with" these committees.

year, blandly listen to proposals
for correction of excessive dust
conditions, better ventilation, re-

where substantial expense is in-

cooperative state mine inspec-

Issues in Strike

Some 3,500 farm workers are
on strike in the Delano area, de-
manding an hourly wage of $1.40
—the minimum rate that must
be offered to domestic workers
by growers who request braceros
—plus an incentive rate of 25
cents a box. Over and above the
wage demands, at this point, are
the issues of union recognition
and the right of collective bar-
gaining.

On the day prior to the be-
ginning of the march, three U.S.
Senators were in Delano, wrap-
ping up a series of hearings by
the Senate Subcommittee on Mi-
gratory Labor that also had been
conducted in Sacramento and
Visalia. Harrison A. Williams,
Jr. (D-N.J.), the subcommittee
chairman, was on hand, along

with Robert F. Kennedy (D-.
,N.Y.) and George Murphy (R-
Calif).

A package of bills being
studied by the group would
bring farm workers under the
National Labor Relations Act
and the Fair Labor Standards
Act, would stiffen child labor
restrictions, and would create a

’ new system of farm labor re-
cruitment and a National Ad-.

visory Commission on Migratory
Workers. Several of the bills are

_ being carried in the Senate by

the subcommittee chairman.
At one point in the "hearings,

Kern County Sheriff Leroy G31-*'_‘

yen, who denied that his men
had harassed picketing grape
strikers, admitted that several
strikers and their supporters

had been. arrested, not for violat- -
ing any law, but because they'-

were “about to violate the law.”
Kennedy retorted that both the
sheriff and the district attorney
might “utilize the lunch break
to read the Constitution of the
United States.”

Support Legislation
Subcommittee members heard

testimony during the hearings

from California Gov. Pat Brown,
Benjamin Aaron, head of the In-

stitute of Industrial Relations at’

the University of California at
Los Angeles, and the migrant
ministry of the National Council

of Churc'hes—all of whom voiced‘

strong support for the pending
legislation.

Also supporting collective bar- '

gaining for farm workers was
Bishop Hugh Donohoe of Stock-
ton——speaking for himself and

on behalf of James Francis Car- '

dinal McIntyre and six other
Catholic bishops in California.

The Delano grape strike has

been greatly strengthened by the
solid labor and other support it
has been receiving. IUD Direc-
tor Conway, in reiterating at the
hearings the group’s all-out sup‘-
port, also announced that the
IUD had opened a new office in
Brownsville, Texas to further
aid in organizing farm’ workers.

The strikers also have been ~.

With the football season still. 

months away, Chester Carlton
“Cookie” “Gilchrist,
ful fullback for the Denver
Broncos, last month galloped-
off on another venture. This
time he was off to Zambia,

where the Freedom Mines Ex- ,,

is a director, owns some 67
acres.

He hoped, said Cookie, to ne-
gotiate for an additional 300
acres adjoining the property.

Gilchrist, who a year ago was,

hopping about Timmins, Ont. by
helicopter to stake mining

claims, maintained that the‘

Zambian land has a copper con-
ten of 14.2 percent.

H Asbestos a Dangerto Entire Population. Says Doctor

Asbestos dust, which has been connected with the extremely high rate of fatal cancer in as-
bestos workers, may present serious danger to the general population, according to Dr. Irving J.
Selikoff of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Previous studies have shown that deaths from

lung cancer are six to seven times higher than normal in asbestos workers, and that the death rate ‘

from other types of cancer among asbestos workers is three times higher than normal.
The danger to the general population, says Dr. Selikoff, results from asbestos contamination of
the air in both urban and rural areas.
In a New York Times report, Dr. Selikoff pointed out that asbestos, in addition to its best known
use as an insulator and fireproofer, makes up 50 percent of asphalt tile, and is used in dental cement,
brake linings, plastics, beer filters, gas masks and paper. Until last year,. some schools used as-

bestos dust instead of sand for
children to play in. _

Some protection of asbestos
workers can be provided
.through sufficient, ventilation,
use of respirators,'and wetting
down to reduce dust. ,

Disabling Work

lniuries Increase

The National Safety; Council
report for 1965 shows that
some 14,000 Americans died in
on-the-job accidents, only 100
fewer than in the previous year.
Disabling work injuries, how-
, ever, increased in 1965 by 50,000

-to a total of 2,100,000.

U.S. Report on

Dutch Creek Tragedy

The long-awaited report by
the U. S. Bureau of Mines on
the Dec. 28 explosion at the
Dutch Creek coal mine near
Redstone, Colorado has been re-
leased. The Bureau concluded
that the direct cause of the
tragedy,
deaths, was the explosion of
methane gas ignited by an are
or spark from a temporary ca-
ble splice on a loading machine.
The Bureau notes that gas ac-
cumulated because ventilation
was restricted by piled-up coal.

The United Mine Workers
Journal comments: “. . . note
that the Bureau makes 13
recommendations in the report.
This means that the Bureau’s
experts noted 13 different in-

which caused eight’

stances of bad coal mining
practices. This tragedy, like

every death that occurs in coal-

mines, was preventable. Bad
management practices based on

‘coal-pushing tactics, plus sloppy’

supervision inevitably c a u s e
trouble. It would appear, based
on what was found by the in-
vestigators, that these factors
were present at the Dutch Creek
mine on December 28, 1965.”

Two Cadmium’
Poisoning Deaths

The Division of Occupational
Health of the U.S. Public Health
Service has issued a warning in
connection with the use of silver
solder containing cadmium.
Two workers, one in Utah and
one in California, died as a re-
sult of cadmium poisoning from
the fumes emitted from this
type of solder. The Division
urges that warning labels should

"be carefully read and followed;

the working area should be ade-
quately ventilated, preferably
with specific exhaust systems;
workers should avoid breathing
emitted fumes.

Workers also are urged to tell
their doctors what their jobs
are and what types of materials
they handle. The Utah death
was first incorrectly ascribed to
“ammonia poisoning”-—the man
had told his doctor that he had

Local 1036 Workers Out
Front in Nickel Industry

WERNER LAKE, Ont.—A recently concluded two-year contract
agreement providing wage gains ranging from 60 to 87 cents per
hour puts the workers at Metal Mines Limited in this northwestern
‘Ontario community, members of Mine-Mill Local 1036, substantially
ahead of nickel industry employees elsewhere in Canada.

In addition to the wage hikes—60 cents an hour for miners,
65 cents for -mill operators, and 87 cents for tradesmen—-an addi-

tional paid holiday was gained,
making a total of eight.
The regular work week is re-

duced from 44 to 40 hours im- .

mediately, with time—and-a-half
being paid for any hours in ex-
cess of that or of eight hours in
"one day. Any future change in
work schedules shall be made
only after consultation with the
union.

Health and Welfare
The weekly sickness and acci-

 dent benefit is boosted from $40

  

to $55. and life insurance for all

employees is increased to $5000.

The company will assume 60

percent of the cost of the entire
I health and welfare plan.

been working with ammonia,
but neglected to mention silver
solder. It was not until post-
mortem tissue tests" were made
that cadmium poisoning " was
discovered. a

The Division says that part of
the problem comes from the
fact that there are few require-
ments for labeling of hazardous
industrial materials. ,

Senator Frank Moss (D-Utah)
has urged the Public Health
Service to undertake a. study of
the types of solder involved in
the fatalities and develop, to-
gether with industry, any neces-
sary changes in the products.
He has asked also the Surgeon
General of the United States to
determine if there is a need for
federal labeling legislation in
the field of occupational health.

Dust Disease in
' Soft Coal Miners

A new form of dust disease
affecting soft coal miners has
been reported by two patholo-
gists—~one of them from the
U.S. Public Health Service-
working at the Appalachian
Regional Hospital at Beckley,
West Virginia. As yet unnamed,
the disease develops from cuffs
of coal dust forming around the
blood vessels of the lungs, thus
causing high blood pressure of
the lung and forcing the heart
to work harder. This ultimately
results in enlargement of the
heart and death.

Dr. Hawey A. Wells (of the
Public Health Service) and Dr.
Werner A. Laqueur reported
their findings in March to the
International Academy of Path-
ology in Cleveland. Although
fatalities ‘of this sort had been

‘associated in the past with ‘

miners suffering from silicosis
and other severe lung ailments,
heart failure and enlargement
of the heart had not previously
been recognized in simple pneu-
moconiosis.

According to the New York
Times, Drs. Wells and Laqueur
hope that further study may
shed light on other lung dis-
eases —- including cancer, and
emphysema-—caused by rock
dust and asbestos.

Work for Peace, Patton  

Urges in Farewell Speech      

_DENVER_, Colo.‘ +-, Stepping
down at age_63 from the presi-
dency of , the National‘ Farmers
Union, James G. Patton in his
farewell speech to the organiza-
tion’s 64th convention here last
month again returned to the
theme he has consistently
stressed over his quarter cen-
tury in the NFU’s top position-

the need to work continually to «

build a lasting peace.

Such a peace cannot be built
on power, Patton maintained,
but must be based upon psycho-
logical change. In traveling at
road to peace, said Patton also,
“it must be the job of mankind
to close the gap of poverty.”

“We in America,” said the
longtime NFU leader, “can’t

New Job

Named two weeks later to the
presidency of the National Coun-
cil on Agricultural Life and La-
bor (NCALL), an organization of
46 groups dedicated to helping
solve the economic, social and
cultural problems of rural Amer-
ica, Patton has watched the Na-
tional Farmers Union’s mem-
bership grow from 78,000 to 250,-

000 farm families during the

past 25 years. One of his hopes
for the future, he has indicated,
is farm bargaining by coopera-
tives that are able to. control suf-
ficient supplies to obtain

re» I

g , 3 children's apparel. 'ins\ist-'upofr_f."
turns that would no longerneed  ’ V .- 2   

to be supplemented  goverri-‘ ' i
ment payments. ’ o 

Meanwhile, the primary eaims
of the new,organiza'tion that Pat-

ton -heads are to bring about‘, ‘

meaningful coverage of farm

workers under existing labor”

laws and to secure adequate

‘Congressional appropriations, for  .
le gislation benefiting. rural  ~- ‘

areas.

New NFU President ”

The NFU convention elected
as the organization’s _ new presi-
dent Tony T. Dechant of Denver,
NFU secretary-treasurer for the
past 20 years, who defeated Jay
I. Naman of Waco, Texas.

Like Patton, Dechant was born
on a farm in Kansas and, like

him too, he is a political liberal. .-

Prior to joining the NFU, De-
chant worked for the National
Youth Administration, which as-
sists 'in finding jobs for young-
sters throughout the country. _

Dechant, who maintains the

organization’s major objective ,

is to keep the family farmer in
business, believes that the NFU
can grow stronger in s t a t e s
where it’s already strong as well
as move into new territories.
Farm organizations, he believes,

are key during the present tran- ,

sitional period of increasing pro-
duction.

Mine-Mill President 'Al Skin-
ner telegramed the u n to n’s

greetings and best wishes to the ‘ .

NFU convention, adding a wish,
to Patton, for a happy retire-
ment.

Patton, though, has no inten-I» he
tion of dropping out of sight. ‘_In_.,, ,. .‘
addition_ to This. new job with  "

NCALL, he reportedly has been _
approached about running for”

political office in Coloradof-ei: “ ' "
