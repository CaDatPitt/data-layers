To C ripple Mme Safety Bill

I WASHINGTON, D.C.-——A House vote on the administrations’ federal safety bill
covering metal and mineral mines and mills, scheduled for July 19, was postponed at

the 11th hour and the bill was returned to the Rules Committee when Rep. Wayne N. '

Aspinall (D-Colo.) indicated his intention to‘ try to amend the measure on the floor.

The bill, HR 8989, and a series of proposed amendments, aimed at the heart of the

proposal, are now expected to come up for floor action early this month.

Every Mine-Mill local and individual members of the union have been urged to
communicate again with Congressmen, asking support for the bill and opposition to
the crippling Aspinall amendments.

Favorably reported by a unanimous vote of the Committee on Education and La-

. bor, the bill appeared headed for House passage and was scheduled to come up on the

chamber’s consent calendar——-a technique frequently used to push through legislation

more rapidly than usual. As-
pinall, however, who ‘is the
chairman of the powerful House
Interior and Insular Affairs
Committee, sabotaged _the July
19 date when he informed
Speaker John McCormack of his
intention to attempt to amend.

Speaking with the voice of the

American Miningcongress, As-

pinall will ask theﬂouse to cut
the guts out of the bill, by adopt-
ing his proposals.

“strongest and most vigorous
support.” —

Smelters and Refineries

The bill, in its present form
as reported by the Education
and Labor Committee, does not

‘cover smelters and refineries.

The Powell Committee report,
however, notes that the Select
Subcommittee on Labor which

held hearings on the bill “has
asked the Secretary of the In-
terior to gather and present to
the committee. information with
regard to health and safety con-
ditions” at such properties. “If
this information, when devel-
oped,” the report states, “indi-

cates a need for further legisla-

tion, the committee will then be
in a better position to consider
same.”

Four Guest Speakers Set

DENVER, Colo. -— Over two years have elapsed
since the last Mine-Mill international convention in March,
1963. That fact plus this one being the first summer con-
vention in many years point to a larger than average

turnout when the union’s 59th international convention .

opens at the Albany Hotel here on Monday‘, Aug. 16.
The international officers are pushing for such a
heavy attendance. The extremely busy schedule of the

union’s activities in bargaining, political and legislative .

action, civil rights, and new organizational work during
the past 29 months will be summarized in the Officers’
Report. More importantly, there will be much discussion
and many decisions on Mine-Mill’s program for the future.

Featured speakers at the parley will be U. S. Senator
Lee Metcalf‘ of ‘Montana; James G. Patton, president of
the National Farmers Union; the Rev.’ Fred L. Shuttles-
worth, president of the Southern Conference Educational
Fund, Inc.; and Frank C. Memmott, acting director of the
U. S. Bureau of Mines since the beginning of the year.

(See story on page ,2.)

"Salt of the Earth" to Be Shown
Also. on tap are a reception and buffet dinnerfor
delegates and their Wives, scheduled for Thursday eve-
ning, and a showing of the movie “Salt of the Earth” on

Wednesday evening. The film, based on the events of the ’

1951 Mine-Mill strike against
Empire Zinc and featuring
many membersiof Local 890 in

.Bayard, N.M., won the French

InternationallGrand Prize as the
best movie of 1955.

Seen as one of the most im-
portant in recent years, the con-
vention will develop policy to
guide the union in the coming
two years. Such subjects as fi-
nances and strike funds, civil
rights, political action, educa-
tion and publicity, and bargain-
ing-discussion of which was
initiated at the series of district
conferences held in late 1964
and early this year——will be pur-
sued.

A Nominations on Friday

Nominations for the three top
international offices and execu-
tive board positions from the
union’s fivedistricts will take
place on.Friday morning, Aug.
20, with the canvassing commit-
tee being elected that afternoon.

.As provided by the Mine-Mill

constitution, the nominator must
have the consent of his candi-
date in writing if the candidate
is not present at the convention.

.Any proposed constitutional
changes will be acted upon by
the convention and, if approved,
submitted to the entire mem-
bership on the Octobe_r refer-
endum, which will "also include
the races for the variouslof-
fices.

Although solid contract settle-
ments were achieved throughout
the non-ferrous metals indus-
try only last year, pension ne-
gotiations will be open in the
American Smelting and Refin-
ing chain next year and in other
major chains in 1967. The con-
vention is expected to discuss
and begin preliminary prepara-

 

tions for these bargaininglses-

sions. ’

on rules and credentials, sepa-
rate groups will consider resolu-

rights, and constitution.

bill has received the approval
of a Congressional committee.
Hopefully, by the time of the
convention, the House of Repre-

sentatives will have approved-
the measure. The fight has not

really begun in the Senate.

Former President of  l
Local Dies at Yellowstone

LIVINGSTON, Mont.-—Paul Pollock, Sr., who served as presi-
dent of Mine-Mill Local 33, the Jardine (Montana) Mine and Mill-
men’s Union, for many years during the 1940’s, was buried in the
Mountain View Cemetery here on June 17. Employed since 1948
in various capacities at Yellowstone Park, he died by Old Faithful
geyser on June 14 at the age of 71.

For most of his life a union man who had taken an active part
in promoting better working conditions, first withthe United Mine
Workers of America and later with Mine-Mill, Pollock knew

hundreds of hard rock miners,
who liked and respected him.
Following his death, many
letters of sympathy from miners
all over the country were re-
ceived, reports his son, Walter
Pollock of Billings, including one
from U. S. Sen. Mike Mansfield,
a former Butte miner.

Born at Teschen, Austria in
1894, he spent his early life and
was educated there. He came to
the United States in 1911, set-
tling at Sheridan, Wyo. He later
moved to Klein, Mont. and in
1937. to Jardine, where he went
to work for the J ardine Mining
Company.

In addition to his son Walter,

Top-Flight Speakers Set——S~en. Metcalf,

Rev.Shut'tlesworth, Patton, Memmott

DENVER, Colo.—Four topnotch speakers—-—U. S. Senator Lee Metcalf (D-Mont.), _National Farmers Union
President James G. Patton, the Rev. Fred L. Shuttlesworth, head of the Southern Conference Educational Fund,
and Frank C. Memmott, acting director of the U. S. Bureau of Mines—are scheduled to address delegates and guests
of the Mine-Mill international convention, set for Aug.» 16 to 20 at the Albany Hotel. ’

Memmott will speak on Monday, Aug. 16, with Sen. Metcalf, Patton, and Rev. Shuttlesworth following on suc-

cessive days.

A liberal Democrat who has, in his first term in the Senate, clashed with some. of the most powerful business
interests in his state, such as the Anaconda Company and the Montana Power Company, Sen. Metcalf previously

served for eight years in the
House of Representatives, be-
ginning in 1952. During his stay
in the House, he played an ex-
tremely important role in the
long campaign for federal mine
safety legislation for metal and
mineral properties, and today is
one of the strongest supporters
in the Senate for an effective
federal bill inthis area.

Born in Stevensville, Mont.,
Metcalf, now 54, received a de-

gree in history and economics.

from Stanford University and
his law degree from Montana
State University. He was elected

’ a state representative in 1936,

and, the following ‘year, was ap-
pointed an Assistant Attorney
General of Montana by Harrison
J. Freebourn, with whom Met-
calf sat on the state Suprem
Court in later years. ‘

Elected Associate Justice of the
Montana Supreme Court in 1946,
Metcalf was completing a six-
year term when he ran for Con-
gress from the state’s Western
District in 1952 to succeed Mike
Mansfield, who was elected to
the Senate where he is now ma-
jority leader.

In 1956, he headed a special
Congressional subcommittee on
mine safety, which held hear-
ings throughout the West. Two
years previously, in his first
term in the House, he was cited
by five national conservation
organizations for “distinguished
service.”

Strong Liberal

Sen. Metcalf is a strong sup-
porter of liberal social and labor
legislation, "including medicare,
the War on Poverty, repeal of
Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hart-
ley Act, changes in unemploy-
ment compensation and Social
Security, and tax revision to re-
move inequities. In his race for
the Senate in 1960, he placed at
the top of a list of items he
would continue to support, “Es-
tablishment of an agency to seek
world peace through arms lim-
itation and alleviation of the
causes of war.”

In addressing the Mine-Mill
District 1 conference earlier this
year, Sen. Metcalf had high
praise for the union, saying it
was one of the organizations
which had prevented business
interests from completely dom-
inating politics in Montana.

James Patton
Patton, NFU president, is

known far beyond the borders of‘
that organization and of his
country. Among the many gov-
ernment committees on which
he has served are the Presi-
dent’s Committee for Children
(1940); the National Economic
Stabilization Board (1942-1945);

the National Committee for Civil V

Defense (1942); the National La-

bor-Management Policy Com-'

mittee (during World War II);
the National Advisory Board,

War Manpower Commission»
the National Ad- -

(1943-1945 ) ;
visory Board, Research and

Marketing Administration, USDA -
(1946-1952); and the Public Ad-“

visory Board, Foreign Opera-

tions Administration (1948-1955). ’

Born on a farm near Bazar,
Kansas in 1902, he was gradu-

ated from Western State College_

in Gunnison, Colo. in 1929. Two
years later, Patton helped or-
ganize a cooperative insurance
company for the Colorado Farm-
ers Union (now the Rocky Moun-
tain Farmers Union).

In 1934, he was named execu-
tive secretary of the Colorado
Farmers Union and was elected
president of that organization in
1938. Two years later, he was
elected president of the National
Farmers Union.

Consistently working to Im-
prove the security of the farm
family, Patton has been active
in pushing legislation and in

strengthening farmer-owned co- .

ops.

Early in 1960, Patton’s book,
“The Case for Farmers,” was
published by the Public Affairs
Press in Washington, D. C. It
explains the reasons for strong
programs -to assist the family
farmer both at home and abroad.

One of the founding members
of the International Federation
of Agricultural Producers, he
has served both as vice-presi-
dent and president of that or-
ganization of farmers. .

Since 1945, he has served as
an adviser to the Annual Inter-
national Conference on Food
and Agriculture (United Na-
tions).

Frank Memmott

Memmott, a former state sen-
ator and representative from
Carbon County, Utah, was named
acting director of the Bureau of
Mines at the beginning of this
year, upon the . retirement of
long-time director Marling ‘J.

Franl(‘C. Memmott
Acting Director
U. S. Bureau of Mines

Ankeny. He had been named
deputy directo-r—the number two
spot in the Bureau—on Jan. 28,
1964. T

A graduate of Brigham Young
University, he also attended the
University of Idaho and the
Graduate Institute of Interna-
tional Studies, University of
Geneva, Switzerland. He holds
a bachelor of science degree and
a master of science degree in
economics, mathematics, and
physics, and has taken advanced
courses in mining engineering
at Carbon College.

Now 39, Memmott has had a
varied 10-year career in mining,
having worked in the coal,
uranium, and open pit copper
mines of Utah, the potash mines
in New Mexico, and in Arizona
copper mines. While still in high
school, he began working in the
coal mines in Castle Gate, Utah,
where his father had worked for
many of his 53 years in the
mines. Memmott was a mem-
ber of Local 5916 of the United
Mine Workers of America there.

A Democrat, Memmott served
in the Utah legislature from 1959
until his appointment as deputy
director of the Bureau of Mines.

Research Consultant
He also served as .a consultant
for the Office of Coal Research
in the Interior Department. At
the invitation of Britain’s Na-
tional Coal Board, he visited that

country in 1962 to observe studies

at the board’s research center
and to obtain information on in-
dustrial mining operations.
Before his appointment as
deputy director, Memmott had
been mentioned as a possible
candidate for Congress from
Utah’s First District.
Testifying before the House
Select Labor Subcommittee hold-
ing hearing on the administra-
tion’s mine safety bill in May,
Memmott for the first time put
the Bureau of Mines on record

‘as favoring federal legislation in

this area.

Rev. ShuH-lesworfh

Rev. Shuttlesworth, now min-
ister of the Revelation Baptist
Church in Cincinnati, Ohio, is
one of the outstanding civil
rights leaders in the country.

In addition to being president
of the Southern Conference Edu-
cational Fund, Inc., which is
heavily involved in voter regis-
tration and other educational
work, he is secretary. of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and as such serves
as a top aide to the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr.

In December, 1954, Rev. Shut-
tlesworth led the fight in Birm-
ingham, Ala. against the city
ordinance that required the’

separate seating of whites and _

Negroes on the busses—-one of
the early demonstrations that
provided the spark that set the
civil rights movement in the
U. S. on fire. In 1961, he" and
Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, a
featured speaker at the Mine-
Mill convention two years ago,
were arrested with a group of

on Chrismas Day, 1956.

Attacked and beaten by a
group of white men on Sept.‘ 9,
1957, he came very close to be-
ing killed. “a. . . but,” he said “I
never had any fear. I kept think-
ing about my family and my
work.” He said, “Not once during
the whole fight did I feel any
anger. Perhaps those men felt
they had something they had to

pro-tec-t. It just shows the vicious '

evil of this segr'egation.” He had.

   AGLII to Ask Supreme court
  To Review “conspiracy” case i

. Having been granted an extra 30 days in which to
petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Mine-Mill
“conspiracy” case, defense attorneys Telford Taylor,
Nathan Witt, and George Francis will file such a petition
toward the end of next month. Joining in asking the high
court to accept and review the case involving six past and
present Mine-Mill officers will be the American Civil

Liberties Union.

Several other international labor unions are expected
to join the ACLU in its amicus curiae, or “friend of the

court,” brief.

The ACLU, the best-known civil liberties organiza-
tion in the country, has said, “Unfortunately, the impres-
sion has been created that the U.S. government is treat-
ing Mine-Mill in . . . prejudicial fashion.” Noting that the
courts have always in the past thrown out attempted legal

attacks on the union, the ACLU
declared, “. . it strikes us as
particularly inappropriate for
the government to charge a
conspiracy . . . rather than to
charge the substantive offense
itself’ ‘(alleged falsification of
affidavits). The use of the less
specific although more emotion-
ally-tinged charge raises the
question whether the govern-
ment felt there was inadequate
proof to sustain the substantive
offense . . .”

If the Supreme Court, soon
after reconvening in October,
agrees to review the case, argu-
_ments probably will be heard
during the winter, with a deci-
sion likely prior to the court’s
adjournment in June, 1966.

that the sprawling “conspiracy”
doctrine is a potentially power-
ful weapon that could well be
used against other labor organi-
zations, many unions and labor
leaders have expressed a re-
newed interest in the Mine-Mill
case. V

Many have contributed to the
defense fund and/or expressed
their support for the defendents.
Several labor newspapers have
carried stories on the case,
pointing out the fact that it
first came to trial during Mine-
Mill's long and bitter strike
against the nation’s major cop-
per, companies.

A $200 CONTRIBUTION TO THE “CON$PIRACY" CASE DEFENSE of six past and pres-
ent Mine-Mill officers is presented to International Vice~President Asbury Howard by sev-
eral civic andcommunity leaders of Bessemer, Alabama, who expressed their apprecia-
tion to the union ‘for the 32-year struggle it has waged in the deep South for equal
justice for all." “You have never let us down,” said Iesse Gaines (left), president of the
Bessemer Civic League, in presenting the check on behalf of his organization and the
community,_ and we know you never will." l-\/line-Mill began organizing in the South in
1933, at a time when Negro worlcers were being paid less than whites for doing the"
same Job. In a strike for recognition ‘the followingyear, Warren Ford and George Bell
were killed and several others were iniured by the rifle and machine gun fire of Jefferson
County law enforcement officers. Familiar with the attacks on Mine-Mill and its position
on civil rights in those early days, the Bessemer communityhelps in its defense today.
L. ‘to R.: Gaines; Howard; Mrs. Helen Cooley, coordinator of the voter registration cam-
paign and office secretary of the Bessemer Voters’ League; Rev. G. W. Slone, president-
oi the Bessemer Ministers‘ Conference; and Dr. George W. Myatt of the Disabled Ameri-
can Veterans, Chapter No. 12. Also involved in the fund-raising were Rev. Leon Glover,
vice-president and office manager of the Bessemer Voters’ League, and William Thomas,
president of Local 531 and president of theBessemer branch of the NAACP.

THE "MINE-MILL "UNION

Adgust.i 1:965

ArbitrotorBars Lie Detector
‘Evidence’ From Ariz. Hearing

CLIFTON, Ariz.—An important precedent against the introduction of lie detec-
tor “evidence” in arbitration proceedings has been established in a still-to-be-decided
case involving the discharge by Phelps Dodge of" Luis Silva, a member of Mine-Mill
Local 616. Arbitrator Dr. George H. Hildebrand, during hearings on June 18 and 19,
ruled not only that such tests taken unilaterally by the company could not be sub-
mitted as evidence, but also that the opposition of the union to such examinations pre-
vents them from being carried out as part of the hearing.

“The record,” said Dr. Hildebrand, in refusing to hear the testimony of Arvin
Schultz, a polygraph operator hired by PD for this case, “Will have to stand without

such..- testimony.”

Local 616 is asking for reinstatement of Silva with all rights and full back pay.

Post-hearing briefs were filed
in the case by July 17, but no
decision yet has been handed
down as The Union goes to
press.
Wins ESC-Appeal

At the end of May, however,
the Appeal Tribunal of the Ari-
zona Employment Security Com-
mission ruled that Silva was
entitled to full unemployment
benefits and added $172 to his
benefit account. “We . . . unani-

*mously,” said the three-man

board, chaired by John M. V.
Stevenson, “find the claimant
was discharged for reasons
other than misconduct connected
with his work.” _

The case involves a fight be-
tween Silva, 52, and Eddie Pa-
dilla, his foreman, a consider-
ably younger man. There were
no witnesses to the incident,
which occurred in Padilla’s of-
fice, and each man maintains
that the other assaulted him.

The ESC tribunal accepted
Silva’s version of the facts “as
being more ‘nearly correct,”
saying that his account of the
fight was “clear, logical, and
detailed.” The foreman’s story
at the hearing, said the tribunal,
“lacks reality and evidences a
degree of vindictiveness and
brutality hardly to his credit.”

An employee with‘ 22 years
of service at the PD smelter,
Silva two years ago had back
surgery, with a result that he

was assigned to different duties.
Working as a tongman in the
anode department, he refused
on Feb. 6,to help clean out the
sump under the -anode wheel,
explaining that this work was
too dangerous for him because
he mightreinjure his back. _

The two men went to Padilla’s
office, from where Silva was
going to punch out and go
home. Here their stories diverge.
Padilla maintained that Silva
attacked him without provoca-
tion. Silva testified that he
threatened to “get” Padilla if
the foreman were to cause him
to lose his job over’ the sump
incident, and that, at this
point, Padilla grabbed an ash-
tray and hit.him with it on the
crest of his nose.

Mine-Mill International Repre-
sentative Sylvain Schnaittacher
presented the case for the un-
ion, assisted by Local 616 Presi-
dent Carl A. Krass, Frank Z.
Morales, the local’s business
agent, and Tony Munoz, chair-
man of the grievance commit-
tee.

Krass and Morales both testi-

fied at the 'hearings—theAformer- '
- pointing out , that Padilla’s _:
story‘ changed substantially at’

various steps in the investiga-
tion., '
Right to Refuse Lie Test

of the _lie_ detector test given to

“Modern Times” Hot Modern, Says
Arbitrator, in llixing Tll Snooping

FLUSHING, N. Y.—“To have
workers constantly televised is,
to me, reminiscent of the era
depicted by Charlie Chaplin in
‘Modern Times,’ and constitutes

in my mind . an affront to the-

dignity of man,” said Judge
Hubert T. Delany in an arbitra-
tion award ordering the Eico
Electronic Instrument Company,
Inc., to remove two cameras
from its production floor and a
screen from the manager’s of-
fice.

The company had been using
the closed circuit television sys-
tem to keep constant tab-on its
production employees. Local 431
of the International Union of
Electrical Workers brought the
case to arbitration, contending
that the surveillance system was
in violation of the workers’ right-
of-privacy; that it was in viola-

. tion of the employees’ right to
‘ be free‘ from employer spying;

and that it was in violation of
the section of the contract deal-
ing with “Present Conditions of
Employment.”

The contract article said, “. . .
any "conditions of employment
not covered by this agreement
which are beneficial to em-
ployees and which are now in
effect as regular company prac-
tice shall be continued during
the period of this agreement un-
less there is good reason for
their withdrawal.”

Intolerable Burden

“I find,” said the arbitrator,
“that we are facedhere with a

management action which does.

affect the working conditions of
the employees and in fact im-
poses an appreciable and intol-
erable burden on them as com-
pared to previous procedures.”

“The device at hand is not

-— 3 only; personally repugnant to the

' lance”

employees, but it has such an
inhibiting effect as to prevent
the employees from performing

their work with confidence and ‘
. ease,” said Judge Delany, main-
taining, {‘.‘I had hoped we had

long :passed: that period in labor
relations.”

While basing his opinion on
the violation of the contract by
the company, he said he agreed
that the union’s arguments on
the workers’ “right-of-privacy”
and on the unlawful ‘,‘surveil-
and .“spying” by the
company could not be “totally
overlooked, since I find that the
TV equipment does vitally "affect
the employees’ working condi-
tions.”_ _ -

Padilla, Dr. Hildebrand said
such testimony was not admis-
sible on the grounds that neither
he nor the union was present
when" it was .administered and
that the union is opposed in
principle to the use of such
tests. He also noted Silva’s
“right to refuse to take a lie
detector test in a proceeding of
this sort,” and indicated that it
would be unfair to allow Pa-
dil1a’s test to be introduced.

Schnaittacher, pointing out
that tradeunions throughout the
country are opposed to lie de-
tector tests, argued that the
contract agreement establishes
the arbitration ‘procedure and
that the arbitrator “cannot use
anybody else’s‘judgment as to
credibility in substitution for
his own.”

Congressional Report

He also noted that a Congres-
sional committee investigating
the use of polygraphs conclud-
ed: “There is no ‘lie detector,’
neither gmachine nor human.
People have been deceived by a
myth that a metal box in the

, hands of an investigator can de-

tect truth "or falsehood." The

highly respected S cie ntific

American reports, said Schnait-
tacher, that the machine merely
records a person's respiration,

In refusing to hear the results bmod pressure’ pulse and gal"

vanic skin responses, which the
magazine. says “may or may not
be connected with any emotional
reaction—and that may or may
not be related to guilt or inno-
cence.” _ ‘

The article states furtherthat
it is possible to ‘‘beat’’ a poly-
graph, “and- it is. quite possible
for the machine to implicate a
person who is not in fact lying.”

“I imagine,” charged Schnait-
tacher, “they (the company)

feelit would be quite a ‘feather _. A

regardless of the outcome of
the case if they can get the lie
detector test matter built into
the arbitration procedure.”

The outcome of the case is
yet to come. The lie detector
test matter was decided.
Schultz, the polygraph operator,
received the thanks of the arbi-
trator for coming to the hearing,
but, left without giving testi-
mony.

I The Labor Scene

Automation Hurts Strike Effectiveness

William E. Simkin, director of the Federal Mediation and Con-
ciliation Service, says in his annual report to Congress, “Automated
production methods will increasingly change the balance of power
under any system that relies too heavily on economic sanctions.”

In other words, in industries subject to automation, the strike
weapon becomes less effective. The most notable recent case was
the Oil Workers strike against highly mechanized petroleum refin-

ers who were able to maintain production with ‘little difficulty, using

supervisory personnel only.

*‘A'*

Mississippi Freedom Labor Union

Mississippi is the scene of a campaign to organize Negro cotton
choppers on the Delta plantations. Civil rights workers there found
in their drive for voter registration that Negro farm workers were
concerned about their working conditions—the average wage of

field workers is $3.00 for a 12-14 hour day. Tractor drivers—also ‘

responsible for some mechanical repairs--get about $6.00 a day.
A strike against one planter frightened some others into granting

I wage increases of an additional 50 cents a day to choppers and $1.00

a day to tractor drivers. .
Andrew Hawkins, a former field hand himself, and chairman of

the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union, testified before a Senate

Judiciary Subcommittee early in July that Senator James Eastland
-a Mississippi Democrat, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
and owner of a large farm near Rosedale, Miss.—“keeps the
Negroes in line on his plantation through the use of ex-convicts
who are released to him on parole.” Senator Eastland denied the
charge. Hawkins further reported that workers on Senator East-
land’s farm are so poor they bootleg moonshine to add to their

income. .* d * *

"Evidence" in Slow Motion

In the discharge case of a United Packinghouse Workers leader,
Neuhoff Packing Company of Dallas put into evidence a secretly
filmed movie which, the company claimed, showed the UPWA
leader to be a “slow worker.” The union charges that the speed
of the camera was manipulated to create a slow motion effect.

Rubber Workers‘ Work Week

Since the depression days of the 1930’s, Rubber Workers Union
members in Akron have worked a six-hour day, six days a week.
The 36-hour week was originally designed as a measure to “share
the work,” and has been in effect for 25 years, except for the period
of World War II. A switch to an 8-hour day, 40-hour week has been
proposed several times, but rejected by the union. Early this month
members of the Goodrich local were scheduled to vote on the
question, which arose inconnection with recent negotiations around
the national rubber industry agreement. It is reported that local
union leaders favor the change, and that a company spokesman
says the changeover could be made without any cutback in jobs.
Result of the vote was not available as we went to press.

Falls First Aid Contest

GREAT FALLS, Mont.—A
team of brickmasons, captained
by Lee Fabel, defeated 11 other
teams to take first place on
Sat., June 19 in the annual first
aid contest for the Anaconda
Company’s reduction plant here.
Each six-man squad worked
three problems, each worth a
maximum of 500 points.

The brickmasons, with a total
of 1492, just nosed out the leach
maintenance No. 1 team, which
finished second with 1491. All of
the participants received $50 for
their practice and contest time,
with members of the winning
team each getting an additional
prize of $34. Each member of
the second, third, and fourth
place squads received an addi-
tional $21, $12,, and $6 respec-
tively.

The leach maintenance No. 2
team finished third with 1489
points, while the zinc electro-
lyzing No. 2 team was fourth
with 1487 points. The competi-
tion was close, with the other
teams, also composed of mem-
bers of Mine-Mill Local 16, fol-
lowing close behind.

E. F. Allen, safety representa-
tivefrom the Oakland, Calif. of-
fice of the U. S. Bureau of
Mines, and L. D. Knill, subdis-
trict manager from the Salt
Lake City office of the Bureau,
served as chief judges for the
contest. William Bazo, Joe Free-
man, and H. G. Plimpton, also
from the Bureau of Mines,
served as team judges.

Other Awards

Joseph A. Holmes certificates
ofhonor were presented by
Knillfor. the safety records com-
piled by the fire and watching
department and the steam and
compressor plant. Holmes was
the first director of the U. S.
Bureau of Mines.

One additional award was pre-
sented—-a certificate of honor
and gold lapel button with the
insignia of the Joseph A. Homes
Safety Association, which went
to Ralph Miller for having
worked for 40 years without a
lost-time injury. He is a mem-
ber of the Electricians’ Union.

Death Takes  
Henry Myers

A majority of the members of
Mine-Mill Local 863 in Charles-
ton, S. C. attended the funeral
of Rev. Henry Myers, who died
a victim of a heart attack late
in June. His death is a blow to
the local, of which he had
served as president for the past
two years, and to the interna-
tional union.‘

He was a dedicated union
member. During his term as
president, the local increased
its membership by over 100
men. Earlier this year, Etiwan
Fertilizer Company workers vot-
ed to affiliate with the Charles-
ton Fertilizer and Chemical
Workers, bringing to seven the
number of properties the local
now represents.

El Paso Labor Pushes for

  Taft-Hartley 14-(b) Repeal

EL PASO, Texas—A community program to broaden support
for the repeal of Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act, which now
allows states to ban the union shop, was launched at a meeting
during the week of June 28, called bythe Central Labor Union
(AFL-C10) and attended by representatives of Mine-Mill, various
AFL-CIO unions, and the Teamsters Union. ’ J

The group made plans to set up a public meeting at which
the subject would be discussed, to seek support for the campaign
from the area’s clergymen, to circulate petitions calling for repeal,

and to run a full-page news-
paper on the issue. The ad,
signed by hundreds of persons
in the community, including
many Mine-Mill members, ap-
peared in July.

Meeting with Congressman
On July 3, several labor repre-
sentatives met with U. S. Rep.
Richard C. White (D-District 16)
at his office in the Federal
Building. Although a supporter
of medicare, the voting rights
bill, and federal mine safety
1egislation—all backed by organ-
ized labor—he indicated that he
would vote against repeal of
14.(b), saying he favors allow-
ing states to have an option in
this matter. Texas is one of 19
states which have so-called
-“right-to-work” laws, which
would be eliminated by repeal
of 14(b). - . . .
Rep. White. stated that he
would go along with what he
termed a compromise plan
which would exclude a non-union
member from the benefits and
protection of the collective bar-
gaining process and the griev-
ance procedure. He said he had
discussed this proposal with
some labor representatives in
‘Washington and that some in-
-terest has been shown.
Repeal of 14(1)), however, is
labor’s top priority legislative
goal in this session of Congress.
Although the hot battle on the
issue is expected to be a close
one, most union leaders feel. that
‘the chances of winning this fight
are fairly good. ‘ - .
Mine-Mill International,Repre-
fsentative Alfredo C. Montoya,
who attended the meeting to

plan a community program, also
took part in the two-hour session
with Rep. White. Jim Funk,
president of the Central Labor
Union, a Teamster organizer,
and Ray West of the Communi-
cations Workers were the other
members of the committee that
met with the Congressman.

Company Out to Kill Union

HUMBOLDT, Kansas-—With the. company this year obviously out to destroy the union, some 35

men, members of Mine-Mill Local 570, have been-picketing around
seven days a week since July 15, when the strike began at 6:30'p.m.
Negotiations with Humboldt Brick and Tile began in May, and

-the~clock on eight-hour shifts
the Federal Mediation and Con-

ciliation Service has participated in four meetings. Far from giving any consideration to the pro-

posals of the local, the company, from the beginning, took the posit

ion that it wouldn’t even renew
the old contract, which expired
on June 1. Instead, it has sub-
mitted a completely new con-
tract, with some 22 departures
from the oldlagreement.

Company Proposals

A p r o p o s e (1 “management
rights” clause,_ in itself, would
entirely destroy the security‘ that
the workers now have. Company
proposals to set up qualifica-
tions for the bidding procedures,
to limit issues that can be griev-
ances and can go to arbitration,
to be allowed to contract out
any work are examples of the
type of provisions that Hum-
boldt Brick and Tile is trying to
force on its employees.

The vote to strike on July 15
was unanimous. A significant
wage increase is the major de-
mand of the union.-

Two picket stations have been .

estab1ished——one near the main
entrance to the plant, one near
the railroad. Unable to picket
on company property, the strik-
ers have only about 15 feet in
which to operate at the main

entrance just off thestate high- _

way. Soon after the walkout be-
gan, the state highway patrol
arrived to insist that the picket-
ers keep walking. :Tents and Sta‘-
tionary picket signs had tobe
taken down. ~ . . ~

 Seven-Cent Gain

Since Local 570 was organized
in 1940, the workers have been
out on strike once before. Last
year, when the company had re-
fused to produce any offer in
negotiations on a wage reopen-
er, the workers struck for two
weeks and gained a seven cents
an hour increase.

The union’ members are pre-

« pared for a long, tough‘ strike, in

view of the company’s attitude
in bargaining sessions. Its arro-

J gance, to which the strikers are

determined to put an end, has
been clear throughout.

The walkout very nearly came
on June 17, when Humboldt
Brick and Tile held over three
foremen to load -a car of brick
while the union was holding a
meeting to report on negotia-
tions. ' _ r ‘

An additional paid holiday was
gained—Good Friday — and em-
ployees will now be paid double-
time-and-a-half for h 0 li d a y s

Themine, which began opera-

_tion about the turn of the cen-

tury' and has been part of the
AS&R chain since 1928, was re-

opened late last year after hav-

ing. been closed since 1957.’ On

' Feb. 5, 1965, Mine-Mill again

was certified as bargaining
agent for the properties, hav-
ing defeated the United Steel-
workers of America by a 3 to 2
ratio in an NLRB election.

In the bargaining sessions

'-which have dragged on since
,_that time, however, the com-
.pany has refused to move.
I AS&R_1 has been attempting to

maintain a wage scale, close to
that in effect when the mine was

‘closed down eight years ago.
‘Its attitude has been the same
_on othereconomic and non-eco- ‘

nomic issues. _

In the face of this company
position, the workers felt they
had no alternative but to strike.
The strike vote, taken in June,
was nearly unanimous-there
was one vote against such ac-
tion." The employees -are de-
termined to achieve a contract
close to those covering other
AS&R workers.

Although the. Ground Hog and l

Deming mill employees always
in the- past had been repre-
sentedby Mine-Mill, the com-
pany announced last December
that it would not go ahead with

- negotiations -for the reopened

properties, t h u s, necessitating
the election. After beating back
Steel, however, the local union
still was faced with a com-
pany that wouldn’t really bar-

gain. . .
A ,8th' in Zinc

In its last full year of opera-
tion, 1956, Ground Hog was the
8th largest U. S. zincproducer
and the 22nd largest producer of
lead. In_ addition, it produces a

- little copper and silver.

The ﬂotation plant in Deming,
45 miles south of the mine, when

in operation, mills the ore and

supplies concentrates to the

company’s smelters and. refin-
eries in Texas.

 

Total work force at the mine
and mill is expected eventually
to reach about_23O employees.

‘quite-a tizzy. » ’ I - '

Although, Kovac denied it, much speculation existed
order to associate himself with the Free

wealthy contributors might fall
into the hands "of the newly-‘
formed conservative group. The
alleged desk-searching incident

reportedly took , place on the ‘

evening of June 18, the day fol-
lowing the formal establishment
of the FSA. .
Meeting in Washington on
June 28 and 29, the Republican
National Committee had as one
of its major topics on the
agenda the formation of con-
servative splinter groups. Bliss,
who said that attempts were
being made" to coordinate the

ftmd-raising programs of the

National Committee and the
Congressional Campaign Com-
mittees, declared he had “some
concern” .over the formation of
separate conservative organiza-

tions. -

‘Barry Honorary Chairman

Goldwater, who has an-
nounced his intention to regain
a seat in the Senate by running
against Democrat Carl Hayden
next year, willserve as hon-
orary chairman of the FSA.

for the American Mining Con-
gress, who last‘ year was the
director of the Goldwater presi-

honcho” of the campaign staff,
as Barry preferred to call him
fondly). . '

Top goal of the association,
says, Kitchel, is . to show the
average_ American citizen that
“dependence on the welfare
state was not the only answer."
Books and radio and television
programs are on the group's
program, and an attempt will
be -made to help conservative
writers gain access to the com-
munications media throughout

expected membership of 400,000
to 500,000, Kitchel maintains
that this would “not seriously
jeopardize” the fund-raising ef-
forts, of the GOP.

P -D Negotiator

Kitchel, now 57, is well-known
to Mine-Mill. For many years,
he was the chief negotiator for
Phelps Dodge and his law firm
is still retained as Western
counsel for the company. By
1953, labor relations began to
constitute an increasing amount

of his work for the mining com- -'

panies, and he frequently ar-
gued the company case before
the NLRB.

That same. year, he and
Charles Kuzell, -general man-
ager of PD, testified for the
American. Mining Congress be-
fore House and Senate commit-
tees that were considering re-
vision of the Taft-Hartley Act.
Among their recommendations:
Ban the closed or union shop in
prohibit "industry-
wide bargaining; outlaw mass
picketing; create a Department
of‘ Employer- Employee Rela-

tions and eliminate the De-

partment of Labor. Maintaining
time and again that they
weren’t out to destroy organized
labor, the two men pointed out
that labor had “continued to
flourish” u n d e r Taft-Hartley.

Obviously there was something,

wrong with the law; it wasn’t
repressive enough.

Landrum-Griffin Law

Goldwater, as a member of
the Senate Labor Committee,

next insisted that Kitchel be

namedto an advisory panel on

‘labor management that .‘ the
‘committee was setting up; It

was out of this committee that

soon was to come the Landrum-

Griffin Labor Relations Law.
Born in; Bronxville, N. Y.,

‘Kitchel attended the ‘swank, St.
_Paul’s School in New, Hamp-

shire,’ got‘ a’ B.A. at Yale and
a law degree at Harvard, then
spent a year. in the School for-
International Studies at Geneva,

known" as Evans, Kitchel, and
Jenckes. In 1941, he married
Naomi Margaret Douglas‘ of
one of the state’s wealthiest
copper families.

In 1957, at a time when a
small group that later became
known as the “Arizona Mafia”
was laying the groundwork for
the Republican conservative
movement in the state, Kitchel
became general counsel for the

State GOP Committee. Not too
long before that, he had changed -

his registration from

cratic. V
In 1958, he drafted the ultra-

conservative statement of policy

Demo-

that was adopted by the Repub-

lican’ state convention. He was
an -alternate delegate to the
party's national convention in
1960—the gathering at which
Goldwater. challenged conserva-
tives to “take this party back.”

Devoting full time toithe Gold-
water campaign from early in
1963 until last fall’s election,

Kitchen Vwas responsible for '

some of the most vicious as-

pects of what was generally a _

_dirty campaign. Saying that
the Republicans would not
make an issue of racial vio-
lence, he added that “leader-
ship from the _White ‘ House
could do a great deal to stop

it." President Johnson’s mili- -
~tary record,
“shouldn’t be” an issue, but “I i

s a i d Kitchel,

have h e a r d doubts raised”
about it, he continued. ’
This kind‘ of a non—issue man

should be admirably suited to
~ head the Free Society Associa-

tion, which has so few legiti-
mate issues to fall back upon.
And a final note on Mr.
Kitchel. . . . In the middle of
July, itwas revealed that he
was once a’ member of the
J olm Birch Society. Kitchel‘ con-
firmed the report contained. in

, Stephen Shadegg’s new book  "
.“What Happened to" Gold-
water?” but said his member-

ship had, only lasted for a’ few
days. “I would say that I ,was

COMMENTS ON REPORTS

‘EXHIBIT “A”—STATEMENT or COMPARATIVE ” CONDITION. Comment
on Balances following, refer to December 31, 1964. ‘ '

Cash in General Fund Accounts: Accounts were confirmed directly with the
depositaries concerned. ~ 5

Receivables and Advances: These accounts reflect Notes Receivable and
Accounts Receivable from Locals, Other Funds and Canada; advances of ex-
penses and salary, and various exchang_es_v_vith Councils, Funds, and Others. Such
items ‘are’ collected in the normal "course of business, with non-current items be-
mg followed up for payment, or .,if»uncollec,_tab1e, disposed of by Board Action.
Other amounts due arelargely Veingv._Paid through payroll and expense voucher
deductions, and are not material.’ ’ _ ' g
_ ‘Revolving Funds: Comprise District and Special’ Budget Advances; By pay-
ing recurring bills directly through the International Office, and closing out dor-

~ mant advances, this account has-been substantially lowered during the year.

1 Deposits: Amounts were confirmed directly with holders-, or by receipts on
' Investments: U. S. Treasury Bonds, Face Value. Of the total of $67,000.00

currently in the account, (1) 21/2%. U. S. Treasury Bonds. of 1969z64 in ‘the. amount

of $25,000.00 are still held by the Clerk of District Court in Denver, as ’bail”=bond—.

_ om-Allrcic, SURPLUSﬁACCOUNT, nncnnnna 31, 1064 .
""”""’(To1Exhibit um. ~  -   

(2) The balance of $42,000.00 is presently held in safekeeping by the Central Bank)
and Trust Company, asconfirmed. Provision has been made for the loss. of
$100.00 ‘cost of ten shares of the common stock. of. the Portland Reporter.Publish-
ing Company, the paper having ceased publication, Contra to the Investment ac-

count, is Discount on Purchases, reflecting the difference between Face Value ‘

of the Treasury Bonds carried and their actual cost. The Market Values of the
Bonds were above cost at Balance Sheet date, but the increment is not reflected.
in the Balance Sheet. -

Furniture and Equipment: Net of Depreciation Reserve, this. account had-
been carried forward unchanged for many years. During this period the Board

voted to transfer these Assets to the presently constituted Building and Equip--

ment Fund (Exhibit C-2), in exchange for current and subsequent fees for use of
these assets.

LIABILITIES: Rail Bond Loans: A current total of $50,596.85 in cashloaned .

by Locals and a Treasury Bond of $5,000.00 face value make up this liability. The

loans are collateralized by the Treasury Bonds held inthe Investment account, at 5

cost, and will be repaid as the bonds or cash when released.

Notes and Accounts Payable: Note Payable to Local Union has been reduced . it
to $15,000.00, the present balance. Other payables have been eliminated during 9 ‘
-the period by setoffs against amounts due the Strike Fund and the Building

Assn. 4
Interest Receivable Exchange: Amounts due Local Union for matured coupons
on the Treasury Bonds which are owned by the Locals making the loans. ' ‘ .
Payroll Deductions: Were compared with subsidiary records as adjusted;
remittances to the agencies concerned were being made currently.’ .
Suspense: Potential Income which has not been properly identified by .-t_h_e_,re_;
mitters. Unpaid bills and vouchers at date, are not reﬂected in the Current

Liabilities, since the General Fund and all other Funds and Councils operate on , 

the cash basis. Such payments will reflect on activities of the next period...
GENERAL FUND INCOME AND EXPENSE: Results for the current period’
are compared to the previous period, and are consistent in terms of accounting"
practice. Certain accounts have been recast in the prior period, to match treat-
ment in the current period, such as amounts expensed for New Organization, as
shown in Schedule B-3, incombination with Districts’ Expenses. The prior period,
since it spread expenses for seven Districts over half the year, can only be com:
pared in the Totals for the period directly.   3

tions of the Strike Funds, and all other Councils and Funds; Income and Expe  '
being reviewed for each segment, balances and other assets being confirms.-.
directly or otherwise verified. The Mine’-Mill, Union Building Assn. is now the-
Building and Equipment Fund. It still shows only non-cash assets. _

After this date, the fund for severance pay, voted by the Board in November
1962, was established but shows no transactions for this period. ‘ y

The following statements are subject to adjustment, if any, that may arise-‘as
a result of examinations by taxing authorities, differences in interpretation of con-
tracts, litigation, etc.

'iREDUC'Ii'lON wosxs or THE ANACONDA COMPANY AT GREAT FALLS. MONTANA. under contract with the Great Falls
Mill and Sme1termen's Union No. 16, chartered in 1897. Plant dates back to 1891, when Boston and Montana Consolidated
Copper, and Silver Mining Company began construction of a copper smelter. Refinery was added later and smelting

. shifted to Anaconda, Montana. Electrolytic zinc plant was added in 1916. The Anaconda Company acquired the plant
 in 1910. Plant also operates rod and Wire mills producing rods, wire, shapes and cables of copper and aluminum. Re-
 duction works in 1964 produced 141,000 tons of electrolytic copper, 125,334 tons of zinc, nearly 1,000,000 pounds of cad-

mium, and by—product metals of lesser importance.

V  .erated by one of Anaconda’s subsidiaries, have submitted demands
to the company for a new 15-month contract to replace the one ex-
  piring September 30. Union demands include a 100 percent across-
"  the-board pay boost plus other benefit increases of 50 to 150 per-
‘  cent. The company is expected to counter with an initial offer of

dent Frei’s program for copper industry and in favor of nationali-
zation, is postponing threatened general strike against the Frei
-program until avenues of negotiation have been exhausted. The
Government Minister of Labor, meanwhile, is working on a public
statement of the government’s labor policies. for copper workers

 steam out of rank-and-file backing of the Federation of Copper

 -Workers. * * *
 TWO LONGSHOREMEN from California andoregon report-

 employment from 65,000 to 16,500. -

Silver N ofes .

O CONGRESS on July 15 passed the ‘silver coinage bill in the
form requested by President Johnson. He may well have signed
the bill before this issue of Mine-Mill Union reaches our member-
ship. As reported in our last issue, the bill will cut out all silver
from dimes and quarters and will cut the silver content of the half-
dollar from 90 percent to 40 percent. The silver dollar, if any more
are minted, would continue to contain 90 percent silver. No dollar
coins, however, have been produced since 1935.

‘A’ , ‘Ar wk

0 CANADA will probably follow the U.S. example and reduce
the silver content of its coins, according to N. A. Parker of the
Royal Canadian Mint. Metal composition of the new Canadian coins
may differ, however, from that of new U.S. coins.

0 MELTING DOWN of U.S. wartime nickels is on the increase,
says the New York Times. Nickel coins produced between 1942 and
1945, identifiable by their dull finish and a large, easily readable
mint mark, “S,” “D,” or “P,” above the dome of Monticello on
the back of the coin, contain nearly seven cents worth of silver at
today’s prices, plus a small value in copper. Silver was used in
nickels during World War II to conserve scarce and badly needed
nickel. Dealers in New York reportedly are paying up to $2.50 for
a $2.00 roll of wartime nickels. _

OBLACK CALCITE, long regarded as just another gangue,
although recognized by early prospectors as a guide to silver ore,
maybe a new source of silver. Laboratory studies by the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey indicate substantial silver values in calcite from dis-
tricts in Utah, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico.

Great Falls Capacity to Be Upped

Anaconda electrolytic copper refinery will increase its capacity
on or before October 1 from 12,500 tons to 13,750 tons per month,
according ‘to Charles M. Brinckerhoff, board chairman. Expansion
is being achieved by regrouping cells, solution lines, and solution
heating facilities. * * *

New Hard Rock Drill

Scientific Laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M. has developed a
new drill designed for fasttpenetration of hard rock. The drill bit
is made ofmolybdenum and heated to 1700 degrees Centigrade
(about 3100. degrees Fahrenheit). A tungsten heater at the base of
the drill heats to incandescenceand transmits heat to the molybde-
num drill. -According, to the researchers, the -new drill melts rock
which is blown up the central core in ‘lava form by gas pressure.
-The drill, it is claimed, will penetrate hard basaltic rock at 50 feet
per day,_ compared withtwo tovfourfeet oftenmade with conven-
tional drills: in the harder roickformations. Developers see applica-

tionsfor the drill -in mining, the-petroleumi industry, quarrying and

tunnelging. . . ,  . ,

 On Holiday Pay

.-

SELBY, Calif. — George E.
Greene, a carpenter first class
who has worked at the AS&R
plant here since 1947, won seven
days of holiday pay in an arbi-
tration award handed down late
in June by Adolph M. Koven.

Injured in an automobile acci-
dent on Jan. 15, 1964, Greene did
not return to work until Dec. 2.
The company had refused to pay
him for five holidays during his
absence or for Christmas and
New Year’s Day after his re-
turn, maintaining that a con-
tract provision indicates that a
worker must be on the active
payroll for three months imme-
diately prior to a holiday to
qualify for such pay.

Edward Grogan, who handled
the case for Mine-Mill Local 51,
argued that the contract clause
simply means an employee has
to have worked for American
Smelting and Refining for three
months before becoming eligible
for holiday pay. The union point-
ed to past practice to ‘support its
position, noting that AS&R had
refused to arbitrate the issue
and had made payment when
grievances previously had arisen
on the issue.

It was also noted that Greene
was treated for his injuries at
Kaiser Hospital under health
plan payments which the com-
pany continuedto make, prov-
ing that Greene still was on the
payroll.

AS&R further said that, al-
though from 1947 until last year
it had never made a distinction
between industrial and non-in-
dustrial disability in terms of

qualification for holiday pay, it ,

had changed its approach when
a new contract was "negotiated
last summer. The company sim-
ply decided it would no longer
pay for holidays for victims of
non-industrial accidents.

Koven ruled that the company,
if it wanted to change the prac-
tice of the past 17 years in this
regard, should have raised the
question at last year’s bargain-
ing sessions. AS&R did not do so.

GONZALO CALVILLO. a
member of Local 938 in Su-
perior, Ariz. and a griev-
anceman at the Magma
Copper Company smelter,
recently won his final papers
to become a United States
citizen. The smiling Mr. Cal-
villo has Worked at the smel-
ter since coming to this

country from Mexico in 1953.

Hard-Hitting Powell Committee Report Cites

T

“lndictment" of State Mine Safety Laws

. The House Committee on Education and.Labor, chaired by Rep.‘ Adam Clayton Powell (D-
N.Y.) issued a hard-hitting report July 8, unanimously recommending that the House pass HR 8989,

the administration bill now entitled the “Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act.” Quoted,

below are highlights from the committee’s _report: .
“The Committee on Education and Labor, to whom was referred the bill (H.R. 8989) to pro-

ing considered the same, report f

as amended do pass. . . .”

» mote health and safety in ;metal andnonmetallic mineral industries, and for other purposes, hav-
avorably thereon with amendments "and recommend that the bill

“The purpose of this bill is to reduce the high accident rate and improve health and safety con-
ditions in mining and milling operations carried on in the metal and nonmetallic mineralindustries.

- . . . The bill includes within its

coverage all metal and non-
metallic mining other than coal
and lignite mining. . . .‘
“Mining is universally recog-
nized as an exceptionally haz-
ardous undertaking. . . . While
the Congress has taken action
to provide Federal enforcement
of certain health and- safety
standards in coal and lignite

mines, it has not so far enacted ,

legislation extending such Fed-
eral protection to workers» in
other types of mines. Yet the
hazards faced by workers in
these mines are quite compar-
able to those encountered by
coal miners—the chief excep-

tions being the lower incidence

of danger, in nonco-al mines,
from methane gas explosions
and the absence of danger from
coaldust explosions.”

However, the committee took
note of two major health haz-
ards not encountered in coal
mining:

Silicosis

“Following the 1956 hearings
on mine safety conducted by
the House Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, the Public
Health Service and the U.S.
Bureau of Mines were provided
funds to undertake a revalua-
tion of silicosis in the metal
mining industry . . . the study
. . . found that effective dust
control has not been adopted in
all mining operations «and that
approximately 1.0 percent of air
samples collected in mines dur-

ing the study contained exces- _

sive concentrations of dust when

, compared to standards in use

at the time of the study.

“In 1962, the American Con-
ference of Governmental Indus-
trial Hygienists reviewed stand-
ards for silica dust control in
mining and revised its previous
standards to reflect a more
sophisticated evaluation of dust
hazards. As of the date of the
hearings, only five States had
adopted up - to - date ' standards
based upon the ACGIH formula.
Eight other States used_ the
ACGIH formula .as advisory.
Several of the leading mining
States had no legal standards
for dust concentration in min-
ing operations subject to this
act, and others were using
standards seriously outdated
and inadequate.

- “The committee is strongly of.

enforceable standards. .

which findings are available, 60
percent of those engaged in ur-
anium mining were found -to be
exposed to radioactivity levels
in excess of those recommend-
ed by the Public Health Service.

“Twenty-onepercent were ex-
posed to levels which can be
expected to produce a lung can-
cer incidence rate of 12 times
the expected or more. Two per-
cent were ’ exposed to radio-

. activity levels which can be an-

ticipated to produce among
them a lung cancer incidence

.rate of 40 times the expected

or. more.

“It is beyond dispute that ade-
quate mineventilation combined
with other dust-control measures
is capable of substantially re-
ducing or eliminating radio-
active dust concentrations and
thereby reducing the incidence
rate of lung cancer_ among ur-
anium miners to within normal
limits.

“It is expected that the Secre-
tary of the Interior will enforce
adequate ventilation and dust-
control standards in uranium
mines under his jurisdiction un-
der this legislation.”

Detailed Indictment

“The study’s thorough analy-
sis of the scope and adequacy of
present State mine safety laws,
and the adequacy of their en-
forcement, revealed an- unsatis-

factory record. A brief outline V

follows of the detailed indict-
ment which the Mine Safety
Study Board’s report makes of
current State laws and prac-
tices:

“The large majority of State
mine safety laws—-and 13 of the
50 States had no specific. mine
safety law at all applicable to

mines other than coal and _lig- 
nite mines -— fell substantially *

short of establishing adequate
. . At
least half the States . . , either
had established no enforceable
standards applicate to noncoal
mining, or had drawn up sets of
standards which included less
than half of the ‘reasonable and
elementary provisions’ that Bu-

reau of Mines personnel con- ,-
sidered necessary for the pro-

tection of mine workers. -. 

For the Nation as a whole, the
Mine Safety Study Board esti-
mated that approximately‘ one-
third of the workers engaged
in. mineral mining, other than
coal, were employed in opera-
tions not subject to any State
mine safety law. Whatever the
health and safety
which an individual State pro-
posed to maintain, the funds and
qualified personnel actually re-
quired to enforce these stand-
ards were, all tojfrequently, not
provided. . . . , p p
“The mine inspections car-

‘ried out by Bureau of Mines

personnel during the study cast
grave doubt upon the present
effectiveness of the individual
States in enforcing health and
safety standards spelled out in
State laws and codes. In the
process of inspecting 800 mines,
the Bureau’s inspectors not only
found more than 12,000 remedi-
able hazards—but found more
than 1,700 such hazards which
could be reasonably categorized
aslongstanding violations of ex-
isting State laws. (The figure
of 1,700 is a conservative one,
since only those "violations of
State laws were included which,

in the judgment of the inspector,-

‘obviously had existed for a
time sufficient to have allowed
prior correction’) That fact that
Federal inspectors could go in-
to mines subject to State mine
safety laws and uncover so
many longstanding violations of
these laws—violations which had
remained. uncorrected by State
authorities——speaks for itself.”

Accident Reports

“. . . The committee received
ample evidence demonstrating

Congressional Roundup-
WASHINGTON, D.C.—With Congress aiming for adjournment 
several measures of extreme importance to , fa‘

Americans headed for ﬁnal passage in one or both houses, as-,
Union goes topress. All of these bills have the strong support-‘of

Labor Day,

organized labor.

0 Medicare: On July 27, the House passed ‘a compromisegver
sion of the bill to provide a health care program for persons 65
and older, ﬁnanced by an increase in Social Security taxes. ' 
final bill, worked out in conference committee, then moved to th‘
Senate, where passage was regarded as certain. It alsoiincrease
Social Security benefits by seven percent, retroactive to Jan‘.f1*‘-

and offers an optional program to cover doctor bills at a premium

cost of $3 per month.

0 Voting Rights: Bill is now in conference committee. A majoi
issue is whether or not it will ban the poll tax for state and loca
elections. The House voted to include such a provision. 

O Repeal of Section 14(b) of Taft-Hartley: Favorably reports
by the Education and Labor Committee, ‘HR 77, which_would elim,"

. nate the ban on the union shop in 19 “right-to-work” states, is ‘
pected to be voted upon by the House by the end of July. ‘Adriiini
stration has attempted to put together a farmer-labor coalitionito

achieve House passage of both 14(b) repeal and its -omnibus farm

bill.

In other developments: The House late in July approved a, an
administration measure to nearly double the appropriation _fo_r‘the
War on Poverty, inspite of the Republican attacks on the nine’
month-old program. The bill authorizes $1.98 billion for the program

during the 1966 fiscal year. .

. . Sen. Everett Dirksen, ‘apparently
-stymied in his attempt to get Senate Judiciary Committee approval

for his proposed Constitutional amendment which would nullify-the
Supreme "Court’s “one man-one vote” decision, has vowed to get
a Senate vote on the issue by attaching his proposal to some other
piece of legislation. Labor, which strongly supports the requirement

that both houses of a state legislature be elected on population
lines, is dead-set against the Dirksen amendment . . SB 1781, which
would prohibit the movement across state lines of professional
strikebreakers, is in the Senate Committee on Labor and Public 

Welfare. Hearings, not yet scheduled, are expected in the nottoo"
distant future. Labor unions, including Mine-Mill, are in ._it_-he
process of compiling information ‘to be presented in the hearings.
Bill was introduced by Senators Williams, McCarthy, Case, Bart}

lett, Hartke, Morse,_ and others.
