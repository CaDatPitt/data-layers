Ill SIIPPOVRT OF LABOR

PROGBRM:

The refusal of the large, dominant corporations to accept. the wage compromise
offered by President Truman has forced on strike millions of American workers in
steel, meat packing, auto and electrical, in all industries which are the backbone of
our nation. This attempt to lower the living standards and the purchasing power of
our people is ‘a matter of grave concern to all.

We recognize, therefore, that it is to the interests of the entire community to
support Labor's struggle for a living wage. '

For that reason, we representatives of Business, Professional, Religious, Fra-
ternal, Veteran, Educational, Civic, Women’s Political, Youth and related organiza-
tions endorse the Council to aid the striking members of .Unions in this area.
