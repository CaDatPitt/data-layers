Policy Statement of the National

COMMITTEE FOR NON VIOLENT ACTION

PRESIDENT KENNEDY, in his speech of October 22, called on Americans to
face somber facts, and to respond in a manner consistent with our national
character and courage. It is indeed the moment to face the facts before us. But
we question the President’s reading of these fact, and his own proposals for
a path to be taken.

We do not criticize the President’s motives or those of his Administration.
We criticize the commitment to military force which has entrapped our leaders
and those of all nations. This commitment leads not to peace but to disaster.
It must be renounced. The Cuban crisis, along with other situations of inter-
national conﬂict, must be dealt with by methods of reconciliation and non-
violence.

The President’s speech expresses double standards of political morality and
responsibility. Soviet actions are condemned as agressive and deceptive. Our
own nearly identical acts are justiﬁed or go uncriticized.

The President speaks of “offensive missile sites” now in preparation in
Cuba. “Offensive missiles” are deﬁned as intermediate range Weapons which
can strike to distances of 1000-2000 miles. Jet bombers also are classiﬁed as
offensive weapons. “This urgent transformation of Cuba into an important
strategic base——by the presence of these large long-range and clearly offensive
Weapons of sudden mass destruction——constitutes an explicit threat to the peace

 

and security of all the Americas. . .” claims the President. Further, he implies
that intermediate range ballistic missiles are inherently offensive: “only last
month I made clear the distinction between the introduction of ground-to-ground
missiles and the existence of defensive anti-aircraft missiles.”

His description of such weapons, intermediate ranged missiles and a jet
bombers within rapid striking range of their targets, is an almost exact descrip-
tion of the strategic nuclear forces the United States has built and maintained
around the Soviet Union for a decade. Thor missiles based in England and
Turkey are similar to those sighted in Cuba. American jet bomber bases speckle
the map of Europe, the Near East and Southeast Asia. The people of the Soviet
Union have lived for years in the “bull's eye” of these weapons of ours.

The President criticizes the cloak of secrecy and deception that has charac-
terized Soviet missile deployment. He says, “Nuclear weapons are so destructive
and ballistic missiles are so swift that any . . . sudden change in their deploy-
ment may well be regarded as a definite threat to peace. . . The United States,
recognizing this fact (has) deployed strategic nuclear weapons with great care,
never upsetting the precarious status quo. . . Our own strategic missiles have
never been transferred to the territory of any other nation under a cloak of
secrecy and deception. . .” Missile-launching Polaris submarines constitute a
central weapon of American strategy. Their deployment to all parts of the world
is as secret as the Navy can make it. We have sought to upset the balance of
missile ﬁrepower or “status quo"-—in our favor—by every means we can ﬁnd.

In several passages, the President accuses Russian representatives of making
“false” statements. At the moment of the CIA sponsored invasion of Cuba,
Adlai Stevenson was assuring the assembled United Nations that no such thing
could happen. As a summit meeting was about to begin in Paris, our U-2 spy
plane was downed 1500 miles inside Russian territory. Our State Department
stated it was a weather observing plane that had strayed off course near the
Turkish-Soviet border.

It is diﬁicult to settle or ever discuss these problems in an atmosphere of
intimidation,” says the President. True. So feel the Russians. Two sides cannot
both bargain from a position of strength. When all leaders insist that they go
to the conference table backed by superior military power, there can be no
sincere negotiations for peace.

This double-standard morality and blindness to the feelings and reactions of
those in the Communist world pervades the speech. It gives the President’s views
a dangerous imbalance. These new weapons are not in your interest,” he tells
the Cuban people. He is right. But does he not see that missiles—anywhere in
the world—are against everyone’s interest?

Why did the President bypass the United Nations and the Organization of
American States and act without consulting them? Why does he insist onlthe
right of unilateral American action even if they do discuss the crisis? “This
nation is prepared to present its case . . . at any time and in any forum——in the

 

O.A.S., in the United Nations, or in any other meeting that could be useful-
without limiting our freedom of action.”

What is the true nature of the “strict quarantine” the President ordered
on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba? It is blockade and
the searching of ships of other nations in international waters——traditionally
acts of war.

What does the President mean when he says, “Cuba '. . . turned . . . into
the ﬁrst Latin-American country to become a target for nuclear war”? Is this
not a threat that the United States may attack Cuba with nuclear weapons?

Threat of invasion is made elsewhere. We believe dreadful consesuences for

_ the American as well as the Cuban people would ﬂow from war over the island.

Cuba would become our Algeria. A guerilla war of attrition would suck
tens of thousands of American boys into a bottomless pit of murder, intrigue
and torture.

Commitments and sympathy would draw Russia and other Communist coun-
tries to aid the Cubans. The war could easily spread and become total.

Millions of South Americans and others in the under-developed and newly
independent countries of Africa and East Asia would indelibly brand us “Yankee
imperialists”.

Cynicism would ﬂourish. We would sanction power politics and encourage
irresponsible and adventurist leaders everywhere.

By fulﬁlling their political predictions, we would increase the power and
inﬂuence of Stalinists and other reactionary leaders in the Communist countries.
Their reckless, inflexible, and pitiless response would plague us.

Once again we stand on the brink of thermonuclear war. American states-
men utter self-righteous statements, practice illegal and provocative acts. We
threaten war, knowing that “the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth”.
How has this come about?

Because it is committed to the principle of military defense, our government
can see no other answers. This has led it to construct uncontrollable weapons
of mass annihilation, practise espionage and deceit, sponsor aggressive war in
Cuba. It has led us inexorably to total national insecurity and betrayal of the
values of truth, freedom and honor that we seek to uphold.

The Committee for Nonviolent Action calls upon all peoples and govern-
ments to renounce military power, to substitute for it defense by nonviolent
resistance and moral, humanitarian and rational techniques of international

A relations.

We condemn equally the commitment of East and West to military defense.
We ask in the name of humanity that the following policies in regard to the
Cuban crisis be adopted by the United States, Cuba, the Soviet Union and the
United Nations.

.*”‘.°’.°‘!"

Renounce all intentions of military enterprise against the U.S. or
any other nation.
Request all military attaches, personnel and technicians of foreign
countries to leave Cuba.

tions for U.N. Action”.)

Recommendations for Soviet Policy
Regard to Cuba

cogs»-A

The Soviet Union will not use or attempt to develop Cuba as an
offensive or defensive military base.

Withdraw all Soviet military forces and technicians that are in Cuba.
Support the U.N. action in regard to Cuba suggested in the “Recom-

mendations for U.N. Action’? which follow.

Recommendations for U.N. Policy
and Action in Regard to Cuba

1.

3.

Refuse to carry out military sanctions of any kind.

Proclaim that both the military buildup of Cuba and aggressive acts
against her are vital threats to mankind and cannot be condoned.
Establish a brigade of eople trained in resistance without violence.
This brigade would inc ude ﬁve hundred to ten thousand men and
women of as many races, religions and nationalities as possible, _and
suitable people of prominence who volunteered. The United Nations
would offer to send this peace brigade to Cuba to serve as a moral
and psychological obstruction to invasion, and conduct social and
technical assistance as the way opened.

Offer to the limits of its ability to help the Cuban people to over-
come illiteracy, poverty and disease. Send teams of doctors and edu-
cators to Cuba.

Set up boards of arbitration and courts that will hear all grievances
of individuals or governments concerning U.S.——Cuban relationships.
irhe U.N. should be prepared to indemnify just claims of property
oss.

Demand of the United States, Cuba and Russia, openness in all of
their relations.

Train, equip and sponsor reporters and photographers who will docu-
ment constantly developments in Cuba and in the United States and
Russia in relation to Cuba. Provide a worldwide network of radio
and TV stations and newspapers to broadcast this information.

Recommendations for General

Foreign Policies for All Nations

(framed in reference particularly to the United States and Soviet Union)
1. Dismantle all overseas missile and jet bomber bases.
2. Support the immediate demilitarization of Cuba, Central Europe

and other tension areas. Withdraw all occupying military forces
and support the substitution for them of nonviolent, nongovern-
mental and United Nations contingents.

Renounce military deterrence. Resolve and declare that they will
under no circumstances threaten or undertake “massive retaliation”
or prepare for “limited”, “pre-emptive” or “preventive war”, either
with nuclear or with conventional weapons.

Begin nonviolent resistance defense programs to take the place of
military programs. These should operate on principles similar to
those which helped free India, were used to resist Nazi tyranny in
Scandinavia and now guide the “sit ins” for racial equality and
civil rights in the United States.

Nonviolent resistance training and research programs should be
set up. Each nation should study the most effective forms of non-
violent resistance for its situation. Citizens need to be trained in
nonviolent resistance to possible invasions and other forms of
tyranny. They must learn the art of noncooperation, which includes
peaceful strikes and boycotts.

5. Start economic readjustment programs now that will insure that
disarmament will not disrupt the economy of any nation and that
all people will have meaningful work and adequate incomes.

6. Strive for initiative in disarmament. Governments cannot wait for
disarmament agreements or for other countries to start disarming.
Each must take the initiative and act now. Doing so would give
the world a moral example. Governments should:

a) Stop all nuclear weapons tests, so that radioactivity will not con-
taminaite the world and more frightful weapons will not be
create .

b) Cease construction and development of missile and jet bomber
delivery systems, that chances of war thru mechanical and
psychological accidents Wlll. be lessened.

c) End research into and manufacture of chemical, biological, ra-
diological and other weapons of mass extermination.

d) Refuse to give weapons of any kind to other governments or to
assist them in arms programs. This will prevent additional na-
tions from joining the “nuclear bomb club” and will discourage
other explosive arms races.

e) End the draft.
f) Dismantle all existing nuclear weapons and convert ﬁssionable
material from military to peaceful purposes.
g) Reduce all conventional military forces to the point where they
cannot threaten other countries.
7. Continue disarmament programs unilaterally, irrespective of other
nations. This would help generate that trust between peoples which
successful negotiation of their disagreements requires.

End all espionage activities.

Stop economic and other nonmilitary pressures. These can become
the causes of war as surely as can military coercion.

10. Negotiate and arbitrate all international disputes. The political
causes of war must be removed.

11. Accept the principle of universality in the U.N. The governments
of mainland China and other nations should be recognized and
given U.N. membership immediately.

12. Sponsor massive U.N. nonmilitary social and technical assistance
programs to the underdeveloped nations of the world. People every-
where must see that thru the practical goodwill of others they can
come to live full and happy lives, free from the fear of disease
and starvation.

13. Assist, by nonmilitary means, movements for independence in
Africa, Asia, Europe and America. Wherever men long for political,
economic and religious freedom, they should be helped.

14. Support large scale student and cultural exchange programs with
all nations, so that false images can be dispelled and suspicions
and fears allayed. All must learn that mankind is one.

15. Guarantee civil rights to minority racial, political and religious
groups within their own borders. Only when democracy is practiced
at home can it inspire people in other lands.

This is our appeal to governments and those who wield political power.
We also appeal to private citizens of all countries.

It is an error to expect that political leaders will, of their own accord,
change their policies and actions suﬂiciently to avert a castophe. The people—
in all countries——must realize that they cannot wait for their leaders and repre-
sentatives to act. They must act themselves. The tragic Cuban crisis is the

“result of social and political forces that have been operating for many decades.

The crisis has arisen because these forces that acted apart before, now clash.
Technology has brought them together. Cuba is a possible cause for nuclear
war because she can become a base for missiles and jet bombers which are a
vital threat to the United States. It is these new machines of rapid and cata-
clysmic destructive power that make war in Cuba a threat to humanity. The
race to make missiles and bombers more lethal accelerates. We already have
reached the stage where minor improvements in weapons can so shift the balance
of power that a nation will feel vitally threatened.

Leaders of nations and governments cannot threaten each other and millions
of people with violent death unless they possess modern weapons and people
who will operate them. Warfare today is carried out by workers in factories,
by scientists in laboratories, as much as by infantrymen, pilots and sailors.
Indeed, our society is involved more deeply than that. The waging of modern
war, cold or hot, requires the services of everyone. Teachers are needed to train
the scientists and technicians. Writers must draft persuasive and moving docu-
ments that will inﬂuence people to support military policies. Publicists are
required to impart an attractive sheen to the science of organized violence.
Communications specialists and printers must saturate the public with military
ideas. Psychologists must instruct men and women in how to live with the
shattering inconsistencies created by shielding societies with violence. Most im-
portant of all, ministers, rabbis, and priests are needed to teach that the use
of threats and violence by their own country is the will of God and an act of
reason with humanitarian motivation.

To practice power politics a government must have the command of a
people’s talents and, as well, their wealth, for the machinery of war is dear.

Are the acts of governments perilous? Are leaders unwise? Then do not
cooperate with them. Are you dismayed at the spending of billions of dollars on
arms, when two-thirds of mankind hungers? Then consider not paying for them.
Every person is responsible for his own acts. The example of one person can
inﬂuence many others.

We must accept the principle of personal responsibility. At the Nuremburg
Trials, the Allied Governments condemned Nazi leaders for atrocious acts. The
Nazis pleaded that they were not guilty. They had only followed orders. They
had obeyed the laws of their fatherland. The tribunal judged that these were
not adequate excuses. All men, the judges said, are morally responsible for their
acts. The Nazis were punished.

We believe the ex post facto trial of World War II leaders was a legal error.
But we accept the principle of individual moral responsibility. Civilization exists
because of this responsibility. When a people abandon their consciences in
favor of political decisions by those in power, their world is doomed to moral
decay and eventual physical destruction.

The Committee for Nonviolent Action supports all who in conscience refuse
to cooperate with military programs and preparations for war.

We support those who refuse to pay taxes or other levies on their incomes
that are used for military purposes.

We support those who refuse military service and choose instead to perform

constructive alternative service, go to prison, or otherwise suffer for conscience’s
sake.

 

No one, we believe, should work in military industries or conduct research
and development on weapons.

No one should cooperate with civil defense or other military programs for
mobilizing and indoctrinating the public.

We call for a general strike against war by working people everywhere,
and strikes, sit-downs and other forms of noncooperation by everyone whose work
is vital to the warmaking ability of nations.

We urge people everywhere to seek independence from reliance upon govern-
ments and large industrial enterprises for their livelihood. We encourage them
to build a society of small, independent, cooperating communities, which do not
exploit and which cultivate attitudes of social responsibility, brotherhood, free-
dom and mutual sensitivity. .

, We call everyone to demand nonviolent rather than military international
relations.

Opposition to preparation for total war must be total. At a time when
mankind’s greatest need is peace, we call each person to spend his best thought,
imagination and energy on creating peace.
