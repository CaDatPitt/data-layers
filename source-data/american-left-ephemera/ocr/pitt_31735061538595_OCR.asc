;pTliec'\SO’Qialistt Workers Party alone consist-
  "and unconditionally champions the in-
'tei'ests of the workers in their struggles against
‘ca“p:italism,'and_,works to organize them for its
Qabolition. This goal is expressed and concret-
 in the Socialist Workers Party’s funda-
mental, objective in the 1948 campaign——the
mobilization of the massesfor a Workers and
Farmers Government. G h

T ‘5tSsuch agovernment, based on direct .representa-

_O

tion from democratically elected councils of work-
‘ Ifarmers, housewives, soldiers and minority
groups, will initiate the reign of real and complete
rnocracy in every sphere of life. It will take
er’the' means of production, expand and coordi-
tiiteuthem in a planned economy, and create the
Vixdjtipns for permanent prosperity. It will end
rule of coupon-clippers and put the former

 

capitalists to work” at honest toil. Its victory will  "   G
bring peace and harmony, to the United States W
by doing away with the material cause of class 

divisions and therefore of class conflicts." The vic-
tory of socialism in the most powerful country will
serve as an inspiring example to be quickly fol-
lowed by the rest of the world. i

Only a Workers and Farmers Government can
reorganize our crumbling society on a rational
basis and bring that new birth of freedom and
prosperity which is socialism.

Only a Workers and Farmers Government,
pledged to irreconcilable opposition to every
vestige of monopoly capitalism, ‘can prevent a
Third World War. at 5 ’

The program, the platform, the policies and
the methods which we advocate will be realized
through the formation of a great independent

party, led and organized by the working class, W
including all those tens of millions whosepbasics

 

 

 

 

 

= "hostility to capitalism needs only thisleadership

Such a_ party, embracing the productive, social
and political activity of the vast majority of the
nation, is today the guarantee of democracy. By
its mere existence it will be an invincible safe-
guard against totalitarianism in any_ form.

The platform of the Socialist Workers Party

system, but to protect the interests of the-

to be supported by the ballot on election day,
but it is more than that——it'is also a program
of action to unite and guide ’the,struggles of
the workers on a year-round basis. Its eifec-
tiveness depends not only on the support it
receives in Congress and other legislative

bodies, but even more on the extent to which i

F orm-er coalyard worker—depression victim, up against the same
misery as millions of unemployed, trying to feed a"wife and three
growing girls in those hopeless days—-union builder, union organ-
izer, a leader in the great teamsters strikes that made Minneapolis
a union town——for 14 years a tireless ﬁghter in the ranks of the
Socialist Workers Party for the cause of the working 'class—t_his
is Farrell Dobhs, SWP candidate for President.

Farrell Dobbs has always been in the thick of the struggle for a_

world of peace and abundance, no matter what the personal risks
or penalties. During World War II he was railroaded to federal
penitentiary, along with 17 other SWP leaders, because he stood
against imperialist war and for socialism—an‘d dared to say so.f

Born in Queen City, Missouri, Farrell Dobhs is now 41 years old.
In the 1934 Minneapolis teamsters strikes he played a leading
role on the negotiations committee, and for the next ﬁve years
was repeatedly elected to office by the membership of Local 544.
During this period he headed the organizing drive of the Eleven
State Area Committee which won an outstanding labor victory-
a uniform contract for 250,000 over-the-road drivers. ‘ 0

Since 01944 Farrell Dobbs has been editor of The Militant, weekly.

The Socialist Workers Party is a political organiza-
tion of American workers that ﬁghts in the interests

/ - of the working class 365 days of the year.

The SWP participates with all its strength in the
dailytstruggle of the workers against the capitalists.
Militant trade unionists constitute the majority of our
membership. SWP members are always found playing
leading roles on picket lines, in strike struggles and
in the unceasing ﬁght for higher wages, shorter hours
and better conditions for all workers everywhere.‘

Housewives, students, the youth in general, likewise
find their place in our ranks. All nationalities, races

‘ andcolors are welcomed on an equal basis.

The Socialist Workers Party is a ﬁghting organiza-

”tion. We believe that the reactionary forces can be
defeated and the workers’ rights and living standards

"maintained only by militant struggle. In 1939, at a
fascist rally at Madison Square Garden in New York,

t the SWP called for and led an anti-fascist demonstra-
‘ ., tion in which 50,000 workers participated. Since the

end of World War II we have aroused the workers

A _ in cities from coast to coast against the growing men-
'  ace of native fascism. Our banners have been promi-
. gnent in all the big demonstrations organized by the
L labor movement against the fascist Gerald L. K. Smith.

About the Socialist WorkersPurty

‘ ‘ x.__,

The Socialist Workers Party means what it says.
Our record proves this. We told the workers the truth
about the last war—that it was not a “war for dem-
ocracy” but an imperialist war for proﬁts. For telling
this truth, 18 SWP leaders were railroaded to prison,
including our candidates, Farrell Dobbs and Grace
Carlson. But that didn't stop us. We still tell the truth-
before election campaigns, during them and after them.

Since the foundation of the party, SWP candidates
have run for office, local and national, in Minnesota,
New Jersey, New York, Michigan, California, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and many other states and cities. Now
for the ﬁrst time the SWP enters candidates for
President and Vice-President of the United States.

American Workers! Men and women, working farm-
ers, Negroes and all oppressed minorities, housewives,
students, youth—we call on you to join the Socialist
Workers Party. Read our platform on the following
pages. See what we stand for, what our program is.
Enroll with us in the ﬁght for a world of peace and
security and plenty—the world of socialism!

UR vast natural resources and pro-
ductive plant, the unexampled skill and energy
of our workers, farmers and technicians, are the
essential elements for abolishing poverty and cre-
ating a rational and harmonious society.

At the same time, never have the American
people viewed the future withiso much uncer-
tainty ‘and fear. For our generation, war and

depression are the outstanding memories of the

past.and the imminent perspectives of the future.

The price of a loaf of bread or a pound of
meat, the right to speak freely without per-
secution, questions of war and peace, every
aspect of life presents the mass of our people
with perpetual insecurity and unending crisis.

H ,i the leadership of organized labor. On the day
when the working class can assure them of its
a determination to end capitalist anarchy and chaos,
the rule of the capitalists is doomed.

The capitalists know this. That is why they
concentrate all their power and energy to crush

, the growing challenge of the working class. The

Taft-Hartley Act, the Mundt Bill, the Committee
on un-American Activities, the preparation for

a transforming the FBI into a Gestapo, militariza-

tion of the country, the strangling of liberties tra-
ditional in the United States since the beginning of
the Republic—this long train of abuses and usur-

ypations reveals that their aim is to subject the

working class to an absolute despotism, the sole

guarantee of capitalist rule in its period of decay.

the socialist reconstruction of society under the
leadership of the working class.

Let him who dares, face the workers and
farmers and tell them that they do not possess
/thelknowledge, the will, the physical and intel-
lectual resources, and the political capacity
to pull this country back from the brink of

A A the abyss to which monopoly capitalism has

led it. The Socialist Workers Party bases it-
self upon its supreme conﬁdence in the cre-
ative capacities of the working people.

‘The Socialist Workers Party presents itself
under the banner of Marx and Engels, Lenin and

would collapse into barbarism. The state of the
vworld today is proof of how correct they were.

Genuine labor politics, however, can have noth-
ing in common with the politics of the Democratic
and Republican parties. Against the background
of national and international crisis, increasing
numbers of the American people view their antics
with indignation and disgust. These parties are
bi-partisan in foreign policy, bi-partisan in their
devotion to capitalism, bi-partisan in their incapa-
city to cure its evils, bi-partisan in their assault
upon the working class and the civil liberties of
the American people. The only difference between
them is the dispute over who ‘can best secure the

tied to the apron strings of the capitalist politicians
and act as apologists, recruiters and vote-solicitors
for them in the ranks of the workers.

The party of Henry Wallace represents noth-
ing but an attempt to exploit the disgust of
the people with the Democrats and the Repub-
licans. The Wallace party is the unashamed
champion of decaying capitalism. Claiming sup-
port as an anti-war party, its leader, Wallace,
has betrayed the struggle in advance by declar-
ing his readiness to support the projected war
when it breaks out. Wallace’s stock-in-trade is
a recitation of evils without one single con-
crete proposal to mobilize labor’s strength
against monopoly capitalism, the source of all
the evils he criticizes.

The Communist Party (Stalinists), which is
supporting the Wallace party in this year’s elec-
tion, is interested in the class struggle only insofar
as it can be exploited to advance the interests of

the arch-reactionary Stalinist bureaucracy, in the   ‘I ' 

Kremlin. When it serves Stalin’s purposes, as‘ it
did during the period of the Stalin-Hitler Pact, the
American Stalinists talk class struggle, support

strikes, pay lip-service to the need for socialism, ’ I

etc. ,And similarly, when it serves Sta1in’s pur-
poses, as it did during the wartime period of the

Washington-Moscow alliance, the American Stal- 7

inists advocate class collaboration, “national

unity,”

instruments of Stalin’s reactionary foreign policy

and must be seen as enemies of the workers’ true,

class interests and revolutionary socialism.

The Socialist Party of Norman Thomas pre-

tends that war can be stopped by the United. L
