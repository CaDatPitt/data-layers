Adopted by the Free Tom Mooney Congress, April 30,- May 2, 1933, in Chicago)l

/ on-'~*"-“ ‘V’

The Free Tom Mooney Congress, assembled_at Chicago April SO to May 3. 1333.
to decide on ways and means to obtain the liberty of that militant champion of
workers‘ rights, Tom Mooney, thirty-two years a member in good standing of the
International Mclders Union #164, and to combat the increasing wave of Slmllﬂr

Vpersecution of workers, farmers and the oppressed Negro masses. &d0Pt5 the f°11°W‘

ing declaration:’

The brazen frame-up and condemnation of Tom Mooney to death, and later to
life imprisonment, and of Warren Billings to life imprisonment in California In
1916. was nominally for a crime with which they had no connection; and this frlme‘
up had to do wholly with the fierce economic struggles between capital and labor.

Framed up by private corporation detectives solely because of fearless
leadership in the struggle for the improvement of the standards of living for the
workers, the continued imprisonment of Mooney and Billings for seventeen years is
an insult, a challenge - a declaration of ruthless class war against the workers of
this country. i

In the course of his long martyrdom, courageously endured in San Quentin,
Prison, Tom Mooney has become the foremost living symbol of the American working
class. As such, he is hated by all of the enemies of labor; and as such, we fight
for him, determined at all costs, in the interests of the working class, to secure
his liberation. ‘ ' ‘

The imprisonment of Tom Mooney has become the keystone of a whole arch of
criminal frame-ups, ruthless attacks and denials of the rights of workers, farmers,
and the oppressed Negro masses. In the midst of the present economic crisis which
brings hunger and starvation to millions of American workers, the imprisonment of
Tom Mooney by the ruling powers of California is continued by those sinister forces
as part of the tactics of the American capitalist class to throw the whole burden
of the depression upon the workers and farmers in lowered standards of living and
denial of relief and to enforce the acceptance of this through a ruthless reign of
terror. These persecutions are connected with violent breaking of strikes, the _
cutting of wages, the fall of the membership of the-trade unions from four millions
in 1920 to two million in 1932, a fall of total payrolls to 38 per cent of what it
was in 1929, the suffering of millions left to starve without social insurance,
with women and children dying of hunger in the cities, with tens of thousands of
farmers dispossessed of their land and driven to the cities to join the unemployed
in fruitless search for work or framed up and tried before military courts.

-Just as the frame—up and imprisonment of Tom Mooney was connected with the
preparations for the entry of this country into the world war, so now the continued

, imprisonment of Mooney, and other victims of capitalist class justice, with the in-;

creasing sharp attacks upon all rights of the workers, are connected with the
militarization of the jobless workers in forced labor camps on wages standardized at
one dollar per day while thousands of millions of dollars squeezed from small tax
payers are diverted to tho troasurios of private bankers, and the spending of
hundreds of millions in the preparation of a second imperialist war by the oapitrlimt
nations and against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

Just as Mooney was first saved from tho gallows by international action and
solidarity of labor on the part of the Russian workers, just so the struggle for the
liberation of Mooney and other victims of capitalist class justice becomes more than
ever an international cause in which the workers of all countries of the world must

,be enlisted to fight.

In this situation, the world-wide demand for the liberation of labor's
martyr, Tom Mooney, is taking on gigantic proportions.

iii!!!

The power of labor to release its imprisoned martyrs is increased in pro-

rportion to the Successful strikes which are now beginning to demonstrate that the

working class will not tolerate the lowering of the standard of living to a starva-
tion level. The power of the laboring masses successfully to demand the liberation
of Mooney is greatly increased at a time when hundreds of thousands of American
workers in hunger marches are a living proof that the American people of all ex-
ploited class havc reached a turning point at which they intend to resist aggression

The joining of white and Negro workers together in defense against their
common misery brings a vast increase in the strength of labor to compel the release
of victims of class and race persecution. The organization and struggles of Negro
share-croppers and farmers in the South, no less than the joining of greet masses of
white and Negro workers together in struggles against unemployment in the citigs,
testifies to a growing solidarity which makes now Icr a greater strength in the
struggle for the rights of the exploited. The joining of the two mifhty currents

of pro est and demand for the freedom of Tom Mooney and for the freedcm.of the 9
Negro boys framed up at Scottsboro, is the historic mark of the developing strength

' of tfe exploited masses against oppression.

The fight for the liberation of Brother Tom Mooney as the greatest out-
standing svmbol of the American Workers’ struggles for bread and freedom can and
must be made an inseparable part of all the struggles of the whole working class,
of the farmers and of the Negro people against suffering and °PPr9551°n-

, The need of unity is a life and death question of the American workers,
today;

* * *
DISUNITY IN THE PAST

In 1916 the frame-up of Mooney was not answered by a united front of the
workers. The labor nmvement_remained divided and the corrupt use of the name of
"Organized Labor" has at times served as an instrument in the hands of those who
conspired to hang this labor organizer. ' >

The frame-up and sentence to death or imprisonment of Tom Mooney and
warren Billings would not have been possible if labor had been united for their
defense. -

‘Their 17 years of imprisonment would not have been possible if at any time
the whole of labor had been united in one firm demand for their release.

For such disunity the trade unions and_the working class have paid and are
paying a terrible price. _ f y/ '

The legal murder of the innocent Sacco and Vanzetti was a part of the price
of disunity of the workers. It could not have occurred if, prior to that time,
the unity of the workers in defense of Tom Mooney had been established. Countless
other acts_of savage violence, frame-up, smashing picket lines, attacks on unem-
ployed—gatherings, such acts of violence as have become epidemic since the World
War, were made easier for the reactionary forces because the workers had not
successfully been united to resist this attack expressed in the frame-up of_Mooney‘
in 1916. Through this breach of unity has flowed a torrent of tyranny in the form‘
of injunction autocracy and deprivation of legal rights. .

A CALL 'FOR UNITY.

This Congress calls upon trade unions and all workers organizations, on the

_exploited farmers and on all intellectuals and professional people to form now an

agreement of cooperation for those objects on which it is possible to obtain united
action for the release of Tom Mooney and checking the persecutions of the working

,_..—

Difficulties standwfh the way of securing united action which arise out of
divisions in the ranks of the working class. Yet at thgnpnesent time, regardless
of these differences, the needs of the working plass”6a1l imperatively for united
action to halt the encroachments on the rights and interests of the workers.

Therefore, even while sharp differences will continue to exist on many
questions between the various workers‘ organizations, it is necessary to bring about
concerted action of all workers and of their-organizations for certain immediate
objectives-equally urgent for all workers and workers‘ bodies; ’ V

We proclaim the first of those to be united action of all for the freedom of
Tom Mooney an ‘Warren K. Billings.

*1!!!‘

In order that such unity of action be made possible under present difficult
circumstances of division between wcrkers"organizations, it is the opinion of this
Congress that to obtain such united action, those organizations which enter into
such a united front should refrain from attacks on other participating organizations
on the issues and proposa1s-of the united front during the period of common action
and while such organizations are loyally carrying out this agreement. Differences
of opinion on policies and tactics, of course, can and must be discussed in tyg
course of working out the proposals for common action in order to clarify the issues”

  

 

._3_

criifgism of even the sharpest sort should be directed against any opposed to
un ed action. ‘

NATIONAL.COUNCIL OF ACTION

This Congress hereby establishes a National Tom Mooney Council of Action
- a United Front for Workers‘ Rights and the Rights of the Negro people. In
doing this we declare our purpose not to form a body which will supersede aéy
organization, but to bring about cooperation and united action of~all existing
organizations. .We propose a council of representatives of various organizations
with different views, but having the common desire to fight for the liberation of
Tom Mooney and the other victims of capitalist "justice" and for the democratic
rights of the working class and exploited masses.

Such a Council, particularly, should not supersede the Tom Mooney Molders
Defense Committee, the General Defense Committee ofthe I W W, the International
labor Defense, or other workers‘ defense bodies, but should strive to eliminate
friction between these bodies and to unite support of the fight for workers‘ _
rights. The Tom Mopney Molders Defense Committee should continue to function as at
present, assuming special charge of Tom Mooney's defense under his personal
direction. The Council of Action will support the Molders Defense Committee
through financial assistance and by developing the widest possible mass movement
for the release of Mooney and Billings.

The Free Tom Mooney Congress calls upon all organizations of workers to
join in setting up the National Tom Mooney Council of Action, composed of
representatives of all workers',organizations which now or after the Congress may

«be drawn into a united struggle for the freedom of Tom Mooney, and, as inseparable

activities, for a united front for workers‘ rights and the rights of the Negro
people. -

The conditions for affiliation to this Council of Action shall be: 1- the
acceptance of the proposals here outlined; 2- the readiness of each organization
to enter actively into mass struggle as'a necessary supplement to legal defense and
parliamentary activity for workers‘ rights; 3~ the mobilization of local organiza-
tions for active participation in local councils of action to be set up throughout
the country.i

This Congress calls for a nation-wide campaign to mobilize the working

Iclass in the fight for workers‘ rights and against all forms of discrimination

against Negroes. Particularly this Congress determines to concentrate efforts on
winning the support of the American Federation of Labor and of the International
Unions affiliated with it, and of the Socialist Party. It instructs the Council of
Action to address itself to and to confer with the leading committees of these
organizations in a continuous effort to break down their opposition. All negotia-
tions With the A F of L, the International Unions and Socialist Party should be
openly and frankly carried on with the knowledge of the masses. These organizations
should be held strictly accountable to the masses for a continued failure to enter
into energetic mass struggle for the release of Tom Mooney and for workers’ and
Negroes‘ rights.

In view of the urgency of the situation this Congress calls upon all local
unions, all organizations of the unemployed and local branches of the Socialist
Party and of other workers‘ organizations, to affiliate themselves at once with the
local Tom Mooney Councils of Action. The need for united action cannot be post-
poned. The independent action of local unions, Socialist Party branches, etc., can
become a powerful force driving toward our goal of united action.

* * *
MOONEY PETITION

The National Council of Action is also authorized to proceed in cooperation
with all organizations which can be brought to cooperate, whether endorsing this
Congress or not, with a nation—wide petition campaign for the purpose of obtaining
millions of signatures to the demand for the immediate and unconditional pardon of
Tom Mooney. Such a petition campaign, accompanying an active mass protest movement,
can become a powerful instrument for arousing larger masses of workers in the
struggle for Mooney's release and the struggle for workers‘ and Negroes‘ rights.

* * *
LOCAL COUNCILS OF ACTION

This Congress calls upon all organizations here represented and upon the

 

W4?

ir_cl‘v&u.r.;1 delegates to take the lead at once upon their return home in preparing
andibmﬁwying on local united front conferences with the broadest possible
rGpf§;%ﬁtﬁ5iCW, particularly striving to draw in those organizations like the

A F-of L and Socxalist Party heretofore insufficiently repr.sented. Mass meetings
should be'neld where reports are made on the accomplishments of the Free Tom
Moose; Congress as a preparation for forming the local conferences. These cone
ferosces should have as their task the setting up‘of local Tom Mooney Councils of
Action and the inauguration of the local united front activity.

TA3 jational Tam Mooney Council of Action in cooperation with the various
organizations should take the lead in the development of the nation-Wide campaign
for workers’ and Negroes’ rights - concentrating now on the drive for the release
of Tom Mooney and Warren Billings.

***

MOONEY DAY AND ANOTHER CONGRESS
The National Council of Action upon the basis of the development of a

broad mass movement, through reports of returning delegates, local conferences,
mass meetings, demonstrations and the petition campaign, will be able at an
appropriate time to set a national and international Mooney Day of struggle for
the release of Tom Mooney endfwarren Billings. This will also become a rallying
point in the whole struggle for workers‘ rights and equal rights for Negroes.’ The
fern cs fuch action and its time should be determined by the National Council in
accardance with the developments in the struggle for Mooney's release. It Should
resist energetically any tendency to diminish the growing mass movement by merely
formally setting a "Mooney Day." ” /

/

The Congress authorizes the National Tom Mooney Council of Action to call
another Congress at such time as it may deem most proper.

*>o<*A
RELATED ISSUES

We regard the struggle for Negroes‘ rights as symbolized by the Scottsboro
case as an inseparable part of the struggle for the complete unity of the working
class, and as therefore an integral part of the struggle for the freedom of Tom
Mooney. ‘We urge the returning delegates in setting up local Councils of Action
to secure the widest possible active support for the defense of the Scottsboro_
boys. ‘

In addition, we urge the Councils of Action to develop united front
support of the outstanding cases today involving workers‘ and Negroes’ rights -
the Kentucky miners sentenced to life for organizing a union; the Atlanta prosecu~
tions for'organizing unemployed black and white workers; the Centralia I W'W
prisoners; the Illinois Progressive Miners arrested and prosecuted for union
activities; the Tampa Cigar workers; the deportations for working class activity;
the five Negro share croppers convicted in Alabama; Matthew A. Schmidt and J. B.
Mcﬁamara, A F of L organizers serving life sentences in San Quentin; and the Iowa
and Michigan farmers prosecuted under the criminal syndicalism laws for organi-
zing resistance to foreclosures. '

A CALL TO MASS ACTION

The Free Tom Mooney Congress calls upon workers‘ organizations to be on
their guard against all illusions concerning the chances of Tom Mooney, Warren
Billings, the Scottsboro boys or any other victims of capitalist court justice,
obtaining their liberty through mere dependence upon the courts of law, or to
secure their rights through constitutional and legal guarantees alone. They have

vtoo often been shown to be the instruments of class persecution;

Mass pressure, not the "justice" of the courts, is responsible for such

_victories as the working class has won. This Congress calls upon the masses to

enlarge this weapon of mass pressure by quickly establishing the united front of
labor for the release of Tom Mooney, Warren Billings and the other victims of
capitalist class justice, and for the defense of workers’ and Negroes’ rights.
