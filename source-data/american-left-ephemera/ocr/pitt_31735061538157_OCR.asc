The Royal workers are preparing
a mass picket line despite police in-

terferance. Two relief stores are

now in operation in Central Falls
and Pawtucket. The boss press re-
port that 400 are scabbing in the
Royal is a lie. Only a small number
of scabs got thru with the help of
the police.

AT THE FAKE voTI-:

A. H. Eddy, Resident Manager,
A. W: C. said the Weybosset" Mill
would open Tuesday morning. The
strike committee said it would“re-
main closed until the l2V2% wage
cut was returned. Eddy was wrong,
the strike committee was right. — V,

Tuesday morning the mass picket
line was dispersed by a huge police
mobilization. But only 40, scabs got
into the mill employing 600. It was

indicated that the 40 would also be ~

taken out by the afternoon picket
line.

This showed how the workers
stand. The workers laughed at the
company announcement that 496
voted to return and only 14 voted
to stay out. The workers knew bet-
ter because they took their own
vote which showed 469 standing
solid and only 49 for returning. The
strike is standing ﬁrm until victory
is won. (More news page 4) ‘

i , Vote General Siilk Strike

1,800 workers at a packed meet-
ing last Friday voted for a general
strike of silk and dye house workers
in Paterson. The workers have laid
down their program: 8 hour day,
higher wages, no ﬁnes, equal pay
for equal work, no night work for
women and young workers, etc.

The over 10,000 silk workers now

on strike in New England and in
Allentown, Pa. are joining in with
this general strike movement. The
Putnam, Conn., Central Falls and
Pawtucket, R. I. strikers were repre-
sented when this decision was made.
The movement is marching forward
under the leadership of the National
Textile Workers Union.

SOLID FOR UNION
By Bloom W’orker, Putnam

We walked out on July 13th, 500
strong. We struck because we are
fed up on slaving on a 55 hour week
schedule. Being solidly in the union
we can win a 48 hour week with
no cutting in our wages. We picket
every day.

AGAINST DISCRIMINATION
By Salzberg Worker, Putnam

Our strike of 300 workers started
when the company tried to discrimi-
nate against a member of the N. T.
W. U. When the mill committee
could get no satisfaction from the
company officials we walked out
solid. We are going to win.

FIGHT TO THE END
By General Fabrics Worker

They tried to starve us back to
work. We answered with relief.
They tried to terrorize us back to
work with clubs and tear gas. We

‘kept up the ﬁght. They tried to fool

us back to work with Anna Wein-
stock of the U. S. Dept. of Labor.
We‘ ran her out of town. Let the
company grant our demands and
we’ll go back to work. A

. WE MUST PICKET
' By Royal Mill Striker

My suggestion is that we form a

march and try to get as near to the ,_

mill as possible. We must picket
despite all the cops in the world.
The papers are lying when they say
400 are scabbing. Out of 1300
strikers only about‘l00 have tried
to scab.

A SCAB IS A RAT

(By a Woman Striker at Wey-
bosset Mill)

At 8 o’clock Friday morning,
when the Weybosset picket line
was heading for the meeting at
the hall, 1755 Westminster street,
two scabbers were seen. One
scabber, of course, was fat Alice
Horrace. The other was lanky
Emma Rine.

At 12 o’clock the scabbers in
the twisting room were ready to
come for lunch, and Carlo Ricce,
the second hand, was spying.
When he saw the picket line he
got into his car, but not bythe
Hartford avenue way, but by the
office way, where there were cops
to protect him and his company’

Just before 1 o’clock “Siss ”
Eddy Pair, the ofﬁce gﬁty, 
going into work, and he saw ‘the
picket line. No sooner ' -die en-
ter that ofﬁce, when “ d-head-
e ” Eddy Shortma comes and
looks at the picket‘ ine thru the
mill gate. fter Shortman goes
back to the ce, the green car
comes down with three cops.
That was a deﬁnite sign that
“Sissy” the scabbed “spilled the
beans.” Moral: A scab is also a
stool pigeon.

 

Above all things, we’ve found
out the names of the ﬁve women
scabbers. They tried to trick us
and come out of work at a quar-
ter to ﬁve. But when they saw
us picketing they called out the
big shot, Jimmy McCall, “the
ladies’ man,” who probably
snooked them out through the of-
ﬁce. The names of the scabbers
are: Alice Horrace, Emma Rice,

. Mamie Salmani, Gertrude Salma-

ni, the new sucker in the place,
Mamie Whalen, the nurse, We
wonder If these scabs read the re-
ports of the General Fabrics
strike and how the scabs were
treated there?

NEWS ON RELIEF FRONT

In the General Fabrics and
Royal Wearing strikes in Central
Falls and Pawtucket relief activ-
ity has been going on for some
time. The General Fabrics relief
store is feeding the strikers three
times daily. The strikers hlaée
picket cards, which are punt; d
when they do their duty, arﬂ then
they are entitled to relief. An-
other store is planned to take care
of the increasing f ding“*result-
ing from the Iflya strike. The
strikers’ relie co mittee has
been collec ' g fun s locally and
sendingﬁegations to other
cities ' c ctions.

LETTER FROM A STRIKER

The Relief Committee and all
the strikers would like to have
everybody’s help by giving all
they can afford to the fund. The
ofﬁce is at 1775 Westminster
street. Everybody must help be-
cause there are plenty of families
who need their bread daily. The
bosses can afford chicken and
steak, but not the workers. 

We cannot see our own people
starving and hollering. We must
give them aid. Every penny helps
out. Anything at all. I

There are seven in my family
and no one working, no pay com-
ing in. No father to support us.

Even though we be hungry, if
no relief came in we would stick
it out for the 12V2%.

We are going to win it this
time.

Gmanagement of the

SOLIDARITY FOREVER

During the course of the strike
the bosses, suckers and paid
agents will go to the homes of the

L strikers and try to get them to

return to work. Remember the
saying of the Irish tenant farmer
on rent day: “Hand me down the
club, Bridget, so I can pay the
dacent man his rent!” Those who
insult you by urging you to
scab, right in your own ﬂat,
should be “paid rent” with com-
pound interest.

A STRIKER NEVER
GETS PANICKY

If you are foreign born, then
some guys from the U. S. Depart-
ment of Labor, Immigration Ser-
vice, (which is a real strike-

’ breaking outﬁt), may visit your

home to ask you questions.
Where did they get your name
and address? They got it from
the company. whose interests

.they are protecting.

COMPANY BALONY

The statement of President
Noah of the American Woolen
that they could not afford to take
back the 12V2% wage cut is pure
balony. The preferred stock of
the company is being recom-
mended as “most attractive” for
its “long pull possibilities” by» the
big bankers controlling the new
company.
The parasites on the bank boards
Chase National Bank,
Harriman & Co.,
get big profits by exploiting us.

 Why should we make rich bank-

E . Hers richer?

HOW THE STRIKE
COMMITTEE WORKS

The Strike Committee is com-
posed of delegates from each de-
partment of the mill. The Strike
Committee has been holding reg-
ular meetings every day. Some
of the workers on this committee
have not been seen at some of
these meetings.

We request all members of this
committee to be present at all our
meetings. All work of this com-
mittee is of the greatest impor-
tance. The attendance has been
very good. We want one hun-
dred per cent. in the future.

PICKET LINES

Up to date we have very good
picket lines, and they have been
very orderly and well organized.
The pic‘ket lines have been picket-
ing the National and Providence
Mill and the Weybosset every
day.

We have noticed that the wo-
men are carrying on the burden
of the picketing. Some of our men
workers stand across the street
looking on. You fellow workers,
don’t leave it all to the women.
Your place is on the picket line
with the rest of us. Not across
the street as a spectator. It is
through our solidarity of ’picket-
ing that this strike is being car-
ried on effectively. The picket
captains are keeping the picket
lines well organized.

NOTES FOR STRIKERS

Be careful of the guy who
starts off with: “I hear that, etc.,
etc.,” and then tells a funny story
of some kind. Tell him to go to
the Strike Committee and tell
them. If it is true, they will tell it
to the world.

Get the facts. Anyway, make
the fellow who tells you some-
thing against the strike prove his
statement.

1

Don’t listen to the squawking
of the squirrels that are peddling
all sorts of foolish rumors on the
street corners.

 

“I am a member of the National
al Guard, and if I go on the picket
line, I will be court martialed.”
Look out for guys who talk like
this.

Second hand to striker: “The
boss wants you to come to work.”

Striker: “See the Strike Com-
mittee. I don’t go to Work until
they tell me!”

ATTA BOY-——THAT’S TH E
ANSWER!

The daily newspapers call at-
tention to the fact that the young
workers are very active in this
strike. You bet we are. We kids
are going to help win this strike.
And we don’t mean maybe!

THE FIGHTING

The cops in Providence drove
the newsboy selling the DAILY
WORKER away from the Flet-
cher’s Mill here. The strike de-
fense committee secured his im-
mediate release. Why did they
drive him away? Because the

  The Strike Vote In Olneyville

The Weybosset workers’ own vote
Sunday conclusively proved that the
mill is standing solid for the return
of the 12%% wauge cut, no discrimi-
nation and recognition of the mill
committee.

458 Weybosset workers cast their
ballots. 469 voted to stand solid in
the strike for the strike demands
under the leadership of the strike
committee and the N. T. W. U.
Only 49 voted against the struggle.
And this small handful of negative
votes were not from the decisive
departments of the mill.

IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS IS
THE DETERMINED EXPRES-
SION OF THE VVEYBOSSET
WORKERS. ALL OTHER

WORKERS, INCLUDING THE

49 NEGATIVE VOTES MUST
ABIDE BY THE DECISION OF
THE OVERWHELMING MA-
JORITY. THE VOTE TAKEN
BY THE COMPANY IN LIBR-
ARY HALL IS AN OUTRAGE-
OUS FRAUD.

All of us now go forward 100%“

Solid in the strike. The workers
have again repeated that they have
absolute conﬁdence in their strike
committee and that it is the only
authorized body that can negotiate
for them. The workers recognize
that- only their vote, taken by their
strike committee, can settle the
strike.

THE WORKERS’ VOTE YES-
TERDAY CATEGORICALLY
D E FEAT E D THE STRIKE-
BREAKING SCHEME OF THE

OLNEYVILLE BUSINESS-
MEN’S ASSN. AND ALDER-A
MAN DUFFY. THE VVORK--
ERS SHOWED THAT THEY
WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO
DO WITH “CITIZEN’S COM-
MITTEES” AND “ARBITRA-
TION” SELL OUTS; ‘THE
WORKERS ARE FIGHTING
UNTIL THEY ’W‘IN THEI

DEMANDS’! ‘

The strike committee calls upon

every VVeybosset worker to dovthe

following:
KEEP AWAY FROM THE
BOSSES’ FAKE VOTE!

STAND SOLID WITH YOUR
FELLOW WORKERS FOR A
REAL VICTORY!

ALL OUT ON THE PICKET
LINE! '
