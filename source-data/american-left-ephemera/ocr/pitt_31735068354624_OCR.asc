W47TH M-M CONVENTION PLEDGES

  FINISH FIGHT ron WAGE INCREASES

The Man Who Came To Dinner

By Rod Holmgren

NOGALES, Ariz.—The “best
 convention in Mine-Mill history"
wound up here September 14,
after an action-packed week’ in
_ which delegates pledged to fight
 g .. through to victory in the nation-
" wide 1951 bargaining drive, to
launch an intensive organizing
drive, and to step up the fight
for peace and for minority rights.

Unity and optimism were the

major themes accented through-

.. out the five days of work and

 ‘ play, climaxed by the nomination

3 of ‘candidates for the Interna-

ji‘ . tional Executive Board, to be

I submitted to the membership for
a referendum vote November 5.

, Convening less than a Week after
-' thousands of Mine-Mill members had
been driven back to Work by a White
House—ordered Taft-Hartley injunc-
tion, the delegates made clear they
will resume their strike, after 80 days
if the major corporations in the in-
dustry have not accepted the Kenne-
co'tt“‘n‘»package” by the time the in-
junction expires.

“IF AT THE END of that 80 days,
there is no settlem'ent with Anaconda,
Phelps-Dodge, American Smelting &
Refining and the Couer d’Alene oper-
ators, We’re going out again and there

- isn’t going to be any injunction to bail
out the companies,” declared vice pres-
ident Orville Larson, Mine-Mill na-
tional bargaining coordinator.

 

 

 

  

 

  
   
  
   
  
    
  
   
   
  
  
   
   
    
  
   
    
    
  
  
    
   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      

“We won in Kennecott the hard way,
and if it takes the hard way to win

by God, we're going to win there
too,” he added.

The convention unanimously adopted
a special resolution saying that the
injunction had given the companies
“temporary aid and comfort” but add-
ing that “they will find that workers
who have been driven to Work under
the club of the slave labor law will
not’;-eact with enthusiasm.”

Delegate after delegates reported
how, under the injunction, new slo-
gans were appearing in metal proper-
ties across the nation — slogans like
“Why work up a sweat? This is a
cooling-off period.” And like “Let Tru-
man get the copper. out!” (See pages
3 and 4 for resolutions on nationwide
bargaining and strike funds.)

Convention delegates were enthus-
iastic about reports by the -_ Interna-
tional officers on the outstanding

series of victories chalked up by the
union on every front during the past
year. They were impressed particularly
by the report of the president showing
that Mine-Mill has made “dol1ars-and-
cents\gains” for its members in both
the United States and Canada “un-
equalled by any union in ‘either coun-
try.” ' -
THEY ADOPTED unanimously a
report of the committteeon organizing
which called attention to the need
for a “win back” campaign to bring
back into Mine-Mill the local unions
lost to the raiding CIO and AFL
unions several years ago. And they
adopted several “concentration points”

for new‘ organizing in the non-ferrous»

metals industry.‘ (See page 4 for text
resolution).

" There was . a deadly earnestness
about the delegates when they took up
the basic crisis problems confronting
the nation's workers‘ as a result of
the wage freeze, the phony _ price
freeze, the growing violations of civil
rights, mounting taxes, and the drive
toward war.

On each of these important issues,
the rank-and-file delegates had strong
opinions, and they did not hesitate to
“hit the floor” to tell what was on
their minds. '

when Pat Rice, vice president of Ford
Local 600, UAW-CIO, issued a stirring
plea for labor unityt “And when I
speak of labor unity," said Rice, “I
mean the real thing. I mean the kind

.of labor unity that John L. Lewis

was talking about last June when he
spoke at the 10th anniversary of my

“The fight for peace can be the

went on. “We’re the ones who krow

ANOTHER IMPORTANT conven-
tion speaker was Harry Bridges, presi-

Union who hit hard at ‘the wage
freeze.

“Now under the wage freeze for-

llnidad, victoria
son los temas do
huestra convention

For Jose Fuentes

La 47 Convencion, de nuestra Union
Internacional de Minas Molinos y Fun-
diciones, se llevo acabo en una atmos-
ferade progreso. Nogales Arizona, fue
el punto escojido por nuestros oficiales
Internacionales, y esto sirvio de mucho
para fortalezer los lazos que nos unen
en nuestra lucha, con nuestros herma-
nos de Union de las tres Nacionalis
dades.

De acuerdo con el reporte de nuestro
presidente John Clark, Mine-Mill en
este aﬁo, ha conseguido ventajas en
‘dolares-y-centavos’ mas numerosas e
inigualables que ninguna otra Union de
los dos paises. En el mimso reporte el
‘presidente nos dice refiriendose a los
asaltadores de Steele; “Este ha sido un
aﬁo estandarte. El aﬁo que nos ha
traido una victoria decisiva en nuestra
larga lucha contra los asaltadores. Y
shoy les puedo reportar que nuestra
victoria ha sido abrumadora y podemos
estar confiados en la victoria para el
futuro.” '

Durante el aﬁo, fueron 25 elecciones
las que gano nuestra Union dentro de
la Camara Nacional de Relaciones
Obreras. Esas elecciones se las gana-
mos a; C.I.O. United Steel Workers,
a Uniones de la A.F.L.—Chemical
Workers and Cement, Lime and Gyp-
sum Workers—-y por ultimo dos elec-
ciones ganadas a C.I.O. United Auto
Workers.

SACANDO un extracto de el reporte
en lo que se refiere a la reciente huelga
en todo el Pais, nuestro presidente nos
dice; “Es una victoria*substanciosa y

°~.rea1 el aumento de 19% centavos que

‘logramos de la compaﬁia ' Kennecott
Copper Co, en los estados de Utah,
’Nevada y Arizona.”

El presidente puso fuerte enfasis en
el hecho conocido de que el esfuerzo do
guerra y la economia de la guerra es;
“Una calle sin salida. Ya es tiempo de
que se exploren las avenidas haci a la

Paz econ mas seriedad, y de ese modo '

dedicarnos a la construccion de con-
troles de inundaciones, escuelas y hospi-
tales. Esa es la unica respuesta de una
Union de Mineros_ y Fundidores.”
Tres fueron los distinguidos oradores
que nos dirigieron la palabra durante
la Convencion. En sus dis'cursos eligia.-
ron la labor de nuestra Union Mine-
Mill. Pat Rice Vic_e—Presidente"'de la
local 600 de la United Auto Workers
CIO fue uno de e1los,_como tambien lo

fue Vincent Hallinan abogado crimi-

nalista de la costa Qeste‘ quien ha de-
fendido muchos casos de derecho civil;
Harry Bridges presidente de In Long-
shoregmen & Warehousem_en’9 Union
tambien elogio bastante nuestra Union
y su labor.

EL VICE-PRESIDENTE O r v i l 1 e
Larson en una parte de su discurso nos
dice, refiriendose a el amparo federal
que fue otorgado a las compaﬁias; “Si
dentro de 80 dias no hay ningun arre-
glo con Anaconda, Phelps Dodge,
American Smelting and Refining and
the Coeur d’Alene, ‘vamos otra vez a
salir a huelga y nova a haber ningun

_ amparo que pague la‘mu_lta para las

. Empire Zinc strike
—   7 ﬂnti-union judge
  ruled out inlrial

»- BAYARD, N. M. —— _The Empire Zinc .-
’ strike was nearing the end of its 11th
month last week, with women and chil-
' edren still holding the picket lines
-solidly and the company making no
attempt to resume production. .

The" trial of 63 men and women ar-
rested in connection with, the. strike
»was postponed after Local 890 suc-
ceeded in disqualifying Judge A. W.
Marshall, who has ‘ruled against the

- strikers in every case that has come’
before him. A
~ ‘The 63 defendants were allowed to
go free, with the "understanding that a
trial judge will be named later by

:agreement between the district attor-
*—ney’s office -and the attorneys for L0-
cal 890.

MEANTIME, Mrs. Virginia Jencks,
wife of Int"l rep. Clinton Jencks, was
brutailly assaulted and beaten by two

, _ men and a woman who attacked her

- while -she was on the picket line. The

localihas filed criminal charges against

all three of the att ckers. .9 '
The local, radio , tation, KSIL, re-
moved the union’s program, “Reports

than four years, of continuing broad-

casting under Local 890 sponsorship.
Officials of Local 890 pointed out

- that -cancellation of the program was

part of the conspiracy to keep the facts

about the strike from the people of

Grant County. ' ,

“We regret that ,KSlL has capita-

1 Clark calls forlabor unity
in address to UE convention

_NEW YOR_K——Fresh _from Mine-
Mi1l’s “best convention in» history,” In-
ternational president John Clark last

week addressed the annual convention
of the United Electrical, Radio & Ma-
chine Workers union here.
»Clark pointed to the fact that both
l\1ine—Mill and UE have been winning
one important election after another
against raiding unions from‘ the CIO.
And he added: “The reason we win
these elections is easy; we have a pro-
gram that fits the needs of the work-
ers, and.the CIO’s program is against
,their needs.” V
“We fight the wage freeze, and the
CIO sends Emil Rieve to sit on the
Wage Stabilization Board to help hold
wages down,” he said. “We fight in-
creased taxés which take bread out of
the workers’ mouths, and the CIO
says another 12% per cent increase
in taxes is a ‘break’ for the workers.”
“WE IN MINE-MILL went on strike
and won a 19% cent an hour increase
~from the Kennecott Copper Corp., and
a ‘week, later the, CIO Steelworkers
meekly accepted a Wage Stabilization
Board ruling which gave them a
measly 8 cents an hour in a smelter
in Utah.” 1

Clergymon congratulates
Mine-Mill for pamphlet

DENVER——Mine—Mill’s International
office here has received a letter from
Rev. ‘Eliot White of New York, an
_Epi-scopal clergyman since 1895, con-
gratulating the union for its pamphlet
on red-baiting, “It’s a» Trick.”

“All that it ‘claims in favor of truth
and progress, and against the shaibby

hoaxes -of ‘red-baiting’ and other big-

otry, is indeed .powerful,”_wrote Rev.
Eliot. ‘.‘Do not be discouraged by op-
position from the war-mongers, fas-
cists and .exploiters—you can feel com-
plimented by their enmity.”

value of even stronger bonds of unity :

between Mine-Mill and UE and other
unions, and suggested that “the
broader the bonds of unity the better.
The more unions that catch on to this
simple idea of labor.unity, the mer-
rier.”

“It’s time to stop talking about la-
bor unity, and really do something
about it. John L. Lewis of the United
Mine Workers has the right idea. He

UE defeats raiders
in four more elections
SCHENECTADY,  Y. — The in-
dependent United Electrical Radio &
Machine Workers has decisively beaten
the raiding “Imitation” UE in an elec-
tion at the General Electric Com-

‘pa-ny’s home plant here.

UE, which was expelled from CIO
shortly before Mine-Mill, won by 11,-
542 to only.4,851 for James Carey’s
IUE. It was thelsecond NLRB elec-
tion at the plant in 16 months, with
UE substantially increasing ‘the size
of its victory. _

.UE won three other NLRB ‘elec-
tions on the same day. Workersiat
the Tele-ton Corp., in Elizabeth, N. J.,
voted for UE over the IUE by a vote
of 611 to 98; at Wayne Pump Co.,
Fort Wayne, Indiana,. the vote was

354 for UE to 183 for the United Auto F

Workers; and at the Detroit Coil ‘Co.

in Detroit, the vote was 71 for UE‘

to 14‘ for no union. , '

we have won through free collective
bargaining.”

“The so-called ‘defense program’ is

a. program to lower the living stan-

dards of workers in this country and
Workers all over the world. Their pro-
gram is simple: they want us to die
so they can live,” Bridges said.

The delegates also heard Vincent
Hallinan, prominent. west coast civil
rights ‘lawyer, describe the AFL as
‘-‘a school of grooms and lackcys, al-
lied ‘with Murder, Inc. The CIO, once
the magnificent vanguard of militant
trade unionism, has now degenerated
to the point where it is obsessed by
./the difficult task of getting Phil Mur-
ray’s small and wizened soul into para-
dise.” o

"But the major address which im-
pressed the delegates most profoundly
was the one by Asbury Howard, Mine-
1_l/Iill regional director in Bessemer,
Alabama, who asserted that “U. S.

understanding and the experience to
put an 'end to the discrimination
against Negroes and Mexican—Ameri-
cans and other sections of labor.” (See

’ ard’s speech ) .

Hosts for the convention were the
locals of District 2, who provided a
wealth of entertainment in addition to
I tasty western—style barbecue supper.

As the convention adjourned, the
delegates voted to recommend that the

for next September, be held in Buf-

“The best convention in Mine-Mill
That was the general opin-

  lloleati raiders
at Molded Products

CHICAGO —— Mine-Mill smashed an-
other raider here last week when
workers at Molded Products voted by
more than 2 to 1 in favor of MMSW
Amalgamated Local 758.

The raiding" union in this case was

the Int’l Brotherhood of Electrical’

Workers, widely known in the Chi-
cago area as a company union. The
Molded Products workers showed they
weren't fooled or confused by the
IBEW promises. They voted '45 to

22 for Mine-Mill. And as THE UNION
went to press, there were still a num-
ber of challenged votes set to bring
up the Mine-Mill score even higher
when the ‘NLRB got around to count-
ing them. -

Resolution on organizing.

One of the most important topics on which the 47th M ine-Mill con-
vention took action was organizing. The convention unanimously adopt-
ed this "report, submitted by the committee on organization, of which
district 1 board m.embe'r William Mason was chairman:

The Committee on Organization re-
spectfully calls to your attention the
cover of the convention issue of the
official organ of the IUMM&SW upon
which are appropriately set forth as
the main slogan of this convention the
three words of determination, “For-
ward to organize.” ,

There is no doubt iii the minds of
the members of our committee that the
time for organizing the,rest of our
~Union’s long-recognized jurisdiction is
here, and that the strength of the
IUMM&SW—shown in the fight against
raiding and in the recent united and

, militant strike against the companies

-—and the will of the members through-
out the United States and Canada to
do the job are there.

In approaching the task of organiz-
ing the balance of our jurisdiction, we,
as a union responsible to its members,
must take such steps first as will most
strengthen and safeguard the bargain-
ing position of the locals and groups
of locals within our organization. With
this in mind we "recommend the follow-
ing guide for the future organizational
work of our Union:

1. Our organizing program should
center on mines, smelters, plants, etc.,
that are of prime importance to the
Union in terms .of strengthening (a)
the position of the established bargain-
ing councils; and (b) the representa-
tion by the Union of all workers in
certain industries. New operations as
well as those lost to the Union as a
result of secession, raids and dual
unionism which are essential to com-
plete company-wide and industry_‘wide
organization, and which are necessary
to the Anaconda, ABC, Phelps Dodge,
AS&R, Kennecott, Coeur d’Alene and
the other Bargaining Councils must be
brought into our Union.

2. Organizational activity should cen-
ter as Well on (a) new organizational
objectives such as the growing mining
industry in the Province of Manitoba
and new mining operations and new
plants such as those in the Rocky
Mountain, Southwest and Northwest
areas of the Union; ’(b) on properties

in the “lead belt” of Missouri, the TCI
in Alabama, certain operations in Utah
and the holdings of the New Jersey
Zinc Company.

3. Our organizational program must

\ include clean-up jobs in locals the juris-

dictions of which are not completely
organized. This phase of organiza-
tional work is better known as consoli-
dation a’nd if undertakenseriously will
bring thousands of additional members
into our organization. A

In order to successfully undertak
carry on and complete the Union’s ob-
jectives in the field of organization
the Union should in its planning of
approaches, methods and techniques
consider the following recommenda-
tions: .

1. The proper technical departments
of the Union should prepare a series
of folders or pamphlets containing in-
/formation on the Union’s service to its
members, its achievements and its goals
for general use in organizational cam-
paigns.

2. The official organ, The Union,
should emphasize all developments in
the field of organization. -

3. The Executive Board of the Union

should specifically instruct all organi-‘

zers in established field stations to
concentrate on such consolidation work
in their areas as remains to be finished.

4. The Executive Board should re-
new efforts to bring about assumption
of greater responsibility for servicing
by the local unions themselves wherever
possible to enable the shifting of or-
ganizers from.servicing work to work
in organizational campaigns.

5. Because sections of our Union and
the non-ferrous metals industry in the
United States and Canada are com-
prised of racial and national groupings
the Union should train for leadership
and include on its staffs workers from
among our Negro and Spanish speak-
ing members and from the thousands
of members of Yugoslav, Finnish, Ital-
ian, French birth or descent and from
other national minorities within the
broad jurisdiction of our organization
in the United States and Canada.

Commanding Int’l officers

-Whereas, the present officers of our
International Union have conducted an
uncompromising struggle over the
many years past for the high princi-

‘ples and standards of our great union

against an. assortment. of company
agents, self seeking adventurers and
disruptors who. sought to subvert our
union, and

Whereas, under their leadership,
these elements have been defeated and
expelled from our ranks in the course
of their secessions and raids, and
thereby made it possible for our mem-
bers to unite and build our union to
the point where wecare now able to
cope with the giants of our industry

on a national basis, long a dream of
hardrock miners and smeltermen, and

Whereas, the effectiveness of our
union has been raised to a new high

level of strength and unity under their-

leadership and under their guidance
We have now advanced to the threshold
of our long-sought goal of‘ national
bargaining with the major sections of
our industry, now therefore be it

Resolved, that this 47th Convention
of/the International Union of Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers goes on record
to commend our International Officers
for their leadership in defeating the
raiders and thereby making it possible
for our Union to rise to new and high-
‘er levels of organization, unity- and
bargaining effectiveness,

Civil rights resolution

Here is the text of the main resolu-
tion adopted by the Mine-Mill Nogales
convention on the issue of civil rights
and minorities:

The general attack on civil liberties,
the special attack, on minorities, and
the assault on the people’s living
standards—all are part of one picture.
Neither the trade union movement
nor the liberation movements of the
minority peoples can defeat these at-
tacks without working together closely.

Nor can organized labor and mi-
nority peoples fight back effectively
without recognizing‘ that the attacks
on civil liberties and on living stand-
ards come from the same source. They
are an integral part of’. a national
policy that appropriates the stagger-
ing sum of 68 billions of dollars a year
for a military budget, that fights an
unpopular war three thousand miles
from our shores. -

War economy is the enemy of the
people’s living standards. An unpopu-
lar war cannot be sustained in the
traditional American atmosphere of
free speech, press and assembly.

n adopting a program for civil
liberties and rights of minority peo-
ples, therefore, we should be aware
that the first step of the program is
full participation in the struggle for a
peaceful foreign program.

Further steps toward-restoration of
our civil liberties include the follow-
ing; .

1. The strongest opposition to the

Conclave ‘blasts barring
of 8 Canadian delegal-es

NOGALES, Ariz.——At least eight
delegates elected by Canadian local
unions to attend the Mine-Mill conven-
tion here were stopped at the border
by U. S. immigration officials. These
included five from Sudbury Local 598
and one each from Port Colburne Lo-
cal 637, Calgary Local 800, and Bri-
tannia Beach Local 663.

One of two delegates from 663 was
admitted, the other barred.’

A resolution was adopted by the
convention, protesting in the strongest
terms against this denial of the right
of union representatives to travel
across the U. S.-Canadian territory as
freely as those of the companies. The
resolution expressed a determination
to put a stop to this “intolerable” dis-
crimination.

Full text of this resolution will ap-
pear in our next issue.

‘Yankee curtain‘ comes
down on Calgary local

CALGARY, Alberta—The “Yankee
curtain” came down on the Calgary
Metal Workers, Local 800, when their
local president, ‘Robert Michel, was
turned back at the border by U. S.
Immigration officials.

Michel was en route to Nogales, Ari-
zona, to attend the Mine-Mill‘ conven-
tion. No reason was advanced-by the
border authorities for refusing admit-
tance. ‘

Smith Act, in cooperation wtili all pos-
sible allies. This should take the form
of pressure for repeal, foi reversal of
the Supreme Court decision upholding
the act, and for release of those con-
victed under it.

2. Participation in a campaign for
repeal of the Taft-Hartley and McCar- _
ran acts, through pressure on Con-
gress and through political action.
There are indications that leaders of
the AFL and many sections of C10 and
AFL unions now are readyto push
a campaign, as they have failed to do
in the past. --

3. We should work closely with such
organizations as the National Associa-
tion for Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple, the Mexican-American. National
Association, the National Negro Labor
Council and Civil Rights Congress to-
ward an end to brutality and terror,
defense of frameup victims, and to-

1 ‘Ward full first-class citizenship for all,

regardless of color, national origin,
sex or political belief. ‘

4. Every Mine-Mill local union
should have an active committee on
civil and minority rights to bring all
such issues to the attention of the
iiiembzership and to suggest appro-
priate action by the local unions, in-
cluding where possible establishment
of special funds to assist the commit-
tee in carrying out its work.

5. Our International Executive
Board’s committee on‘ civil and minor-
ity rights must see —that the entire
Mine-Mill membership is informed on
these matters, and should supply the
local union committees regularly with
information and suggestions for action.

4  Independent
political action ~

The convention unanimously adopted
a hard-hitting resolution calling for
independent political action and sug-
gesting that the time may soon be
ripe for a. labor party in America.
Here is the main part of the resolu-
tion? ~ ,

Be It Resolved: That the Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers can no longer
place their faith in either of the major
political parties, but on the contrary
must seek to establish the unity of
labor as a step towards the expression
of labor’s just politicalaspirations; and
be it further - -

Resolved: That in the establishment
of labor unity atgreat and decisive role
can be played by the United Mine
Workers of America _under the lead-
ership of John L. Lewis, and by the
International Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers and other militant
and forward-looking labor organiza-
tions; and be it further ' 2

Resolved: That out of such real la-
bor unity can be formed a new party,
truly representative of labor -and its
allies in America, which will advance
candidates for President of the United
States and other high. office‘ upon a‘
fighting program built in the interest»

of the workers and the common peo-,_

ple of this country.

UNITY OF LABOR ISMINE-MILL GOAL

Labor unity wasa theme repeated over and over at the N ogales
convention. Here are some key excerpts from the resolution on labor

unity adopted by the delegates.

Mine-Mill now has been an unaffili-
ated independent union for nearly two
years. 7

We are not boasting or exaggerat-
ing when we say that during the period
since our expulsion from CIO, our
union has made labor history. We
have demonstrated, in a manner so
dramatic that everyone has understood
the lesson, that if a union refuses to
compromise in the struggle for its
members’ welfare, there are no bounds
to what it can do. '

If we are°today stronger than we

were before our expulsion from‘ CIO, /

it is not because we are an independent ‘
union but because of the policies to
which we have held steadfast in a
period of great crisis in the nation and
to the world. .

ABOVE ALL, we have demonstrated
that we have a policy and a program
that can win. We have gone about the
business of trade unionism seriously
and earnestly, and we have won one
decisive battle after another. Today
we have the admiration of our friends
and the respect of our enemies.

Part of our basic policy and pro-
gram is the rejection of any form of
labor unity that means becoming the
‘labor section”__of a political party.—
We lhave insisted that in order to.
make any sense to the workers of this
nation, a united labor movement must
keep itself free of any entangling al-
liances with either of the old parties.
We have said that in the long run the
only kind of political party to which
the labor movement can tie itself is
a party that springs directly from the
labor movement.

‘Events of the past year have shown .

once again how right Mine-Mill has.
been. The repeated sellouts by the
“United Labor Policy Committee”
have all grown logically out of two
facts: I) the federations which formed
the ULPC—AFL", CIO and Brother-
hoods—were deeply committed to the
war drive, and 2) they were tied
tightly to the apron strings of the’
Democratic _Party.

As long_as the phhny “United Labor
Policy Committee” existed, even the
shadow-boxing which had been going.
on in recent years around the ques-
tion of organic unity of AFL and CIO
was stopped. Now that the ULPC is
retreating into the shadowsiif oblivion,
the shadow-boxing is being taken up
whereit was left off 10 (months ago.

In the past year, the demands of
organized workers at the grass roots
for a genuine brand of labor unity ha
grown steadily. V -'

. C‘ New allies

As a result of the idemand, we have
been able to develop new allies and
alliances  a large number of local
areas. Those. allies-,,-AFL, CIO and
Brotherhood rank and filers —- have
shown a willingness to‘ join hands with

 U Sept. 24. 1953 

 

us——in one community after another—-
in the fight for peace, in the struggle
against the wage freeze and for a
price control that is the real article, in
the battleiagainst raiding pirates from
other unions.

ATATHE SAME TIME we have con-

tinued to develop our bonds of mutual

aid and protection with the other pro-
g_ressive unions that are no longer
in C10. Three outstanding examples
of how these alliances have contributed
to unions can be found‘ in‘ New York,
Chicago and Los Angeles. In all three

of these cities, Labor Unity Councils
have pressed the fight against the
wage freeze with militance and effec-
tiveness, and have functioned well in
campaigns against both raiders and
the employers.

The one issue which has done most
to stimulate interest and renew hope
for labor unity ‘is the issue of peace.
Around this issue can be found count-
less examples in recent months of
workers getting together for joint ac-
tion. We predict that this “getting
together” will grow apace as time goes
on, and that it will reach further and
further into the higher levels of the
labor movement.

Another .reason for optimism about
the prospects for labor unity ,_can be
found in recent statements by John
L. Lewis, president of the=United Mine

 

Workers at the UAW Ford local’s an-
niversary celebration in June, “sali-
darity of all segments of organized
labor was his major theme," as the
UMW Journal later reported.

“I think now that American labor
should awaken to the ~fact that eco-
nomic and social peril lies not far
down the road ahead,” Lewis said.
“And I think, in justice to ourselves
and those we represent, that we should
awaken to that fact and take steps to
promote labor unity in America!’

The hour is late. One after another,
we see Congress and the Truman ad-
ministration taking away and restrict-
ing the precious, hardwon rights of

labor. Without genuine labor unity
that embraces workers of every indus-
try and is based on fighting opposi-
tion to war, to wage freezes, to phony
misleadership, we will never win back
the ground lost by labor in recent
years.

_q1r Denver "convention last year
said: “Our program calls for the type
of unity that can achieve the repeal of
Taft-Hartley, that can g uarant e e
peace, jobs and a rising living stand-
ard for all the workers of the United
States and Canada. We urge our local
unions to jam‘ with locals of other

national and international unions, re-

gardless of affiliation, for achievement
of common aims on immediate issues,
legislative and otherwise.”

We repeat that statement here be-
cause it still stands. And what it calls
for is needed more urgently than ever,
particularly in view of the onerous

wage freeze which can only be broken
by‘a united labor movement.

International solidarity

We know that the welfare of work-
ing people in the United States and
Canada is closely linked to that of
other workers around the world. The
link is especially close in the case of
those employed in our industry, many
—thousands of whom work for the same
giant corporations we do.

Closer ties with the other organized
metal workers of the \Vestern Hemi-
sphere are possible. This should be one
of the goals of our union in the can-
ing year.

We have a_ pact of fﬁendship
and mutual assistance with the Mexi-
can miners Union. We should partici-
pate in a hemispheric conference of
metal workers to be called in the
coming months by Vicente Lombardo
Toledano, president of the Latin
American Trade Union Federation
(CTAL). Leaders of Mine-Mill have
discussed this conference with Tole-
dano and have been assured that it will
take place.

Our bargaining position with inter-
national corporations, such as Kenne-
cott, Anaconda, AS&R, would be

greatly strengthened if we were able.

to coordinate our moves with those of
the metal workers of Mexico, Chile,
and other Latin American countries.

We believe that only the working
people, who have everything to lose
and nothing to gain from war, can pre-
vent another war—if they act with
firmness and unity.

‘Permanent peace is possible’

The 47th M'ine—Mill convent-z'~on adopted the entire section of the
Presz'(lent’s Report covering “The Fight for Peace.” Reprinted here are

key excerpts from that section:

Nobody has ever claimed that mem-

bers of the Mine—Mill are prophets or
seers. But that’s exactly what they
have proven themselves to be—at least
when it comes to the all-important
question of war or peace.
' In convention after convention since
before the end of World War II, Mine-
Mill has adopted positions and pro-
grams on issues of foreign policy
which have shown great insight and
vision. We have refused to be fooled
.or misled by the hysterical pratings of
the “war must come” crowd. Our long-
standing and consistent fight for peace
——and all that goes with it——today
stands as a monument to the courage
and foresight of _our membership.

HISTORY HAS demonstrated that

- we were right at every step of this up-0

hill road. Now, fortunately, the ma-

jority of the American people have
been won over to our view that peace
can and must be won.

Yet we see—and hear—the to.p lead-
ers of the nation issuing almost daily
statements intended to keep up the
war fever. “The war is dead, long live
the war!” is what they are saying in
effect. But with each new alarmist
statement, the effect becomes weaker
and weaker. As ‘Business Week’ com-
mented August 4th: “Public opinion
is becoming apathetic toward defense.”

The scare-mongers, of course, re-
fuse stubbornly to discuss the issues
in the kind of terms in which the

/American people are -thinking, Par-

ticipants in the “Great Debate” so
widely publicized by. the newspapers
are not you and I, but —men like Tru-

where it should be started.

The -time has come to stop permit-
ting the Russians to set U. S. policy,
and to start making some policy of
our own. If we do that, then the stock
market will not toboggan every time
there is a “rumor” of peace.

The cost of 'defense'

We are spending at the rate of 50
billion dollars a year for war pur-
poses now, and by next July the rate

will be up to 65 billion. As the N. Y. ,

Journal of Commerce commented not
long ago: “The cost of the defense
program goes up each time President
Truman issues a progress report on
how it is going.”

AND WHAT IS ALL this tremen-"

dous expenditure of our treasure buy-
ing us? Do we feel more secure today
than we did when the “peace through
strength” program was launched in
1947-48? Are we any more certain we
can avoid a global war that would de-
stroy our civiliza'tion'? Have we won
any new allies? Is there any less fear
and hysteria among ouripeople? The
answer to all these questions clearly
is “NO!”

All we have bought for ourselves is
more -fear, more hysteria, greater
danger of war.

John L. Lewis, president of the Unit-
ed-Mi-né Workers, put it. even more
bluntly in his already—fa'mou's speech
before Local 600, UAW-CIO, in Detroit
just a few weeks ago: “If Russia does-
n’t want to fight us in 1953 when Wil-
son is ready, who the hell is he going
to fight? W'e’ll be all dressed up with
no place to go.”

CIO is now parroting what we said
about the Marshall Plan in 1947. The
tragedy is that they were four years
in catching up with the truth. Not un-

til their own leaders had spent many
months in cushy ECA jobs did they
discover that opposition to the Mar-
shall Plan is unanimous among trade
unionists in France, Italy, England,
Belgium and other ECA nations.

One of the most frightening develop-
ments in recent months is the growing
demand‘ by U. S. generals for the cre-
ation of a new German army, a new
Wehrmacht. General Eisenhower con-
fers quite openly With groups of for-
mer Nazi generals who have already
been released from prison.

What interests?

Secretary of State Acheson says a
rearmed -Germany is the “key” to de-
fense of American interests in Europe.
What kind of interests require this
sort of defense? -

Somehow newspapers never seem to
find space enough to report the full
possibilities of a genuine drive for
peace. To the ‘American worker, peace
can mean everything. Let’s take a
good look at that $65 billion which
Congress appropriated for war this
summer.

Let’s imagine a B-36 bomber—
streaking across the sky above a
small village of 350 homes, a village
of 1,750 pop. The bomber -costs the
government $31/é million. The 350
homes $31/2 million, if you figure
each one as worth $10,000.

One air “wing” or group costs $21‘/Q
billion. With exactly 11/; billion we
could build 2 million new homes in
America every year, and at the same
time clear all our slums, and -toss in
enough money -to launch a low-cost
public -housing program to boot.

LATE IN JUNE, a. dr.amatic event
pointed up the growing power of the
peace -movement in Ameri‘ca—-and the

big job cut out for organized labor in‘

that \movement. It was the American
Peace Congress in Chicago, attended
by more than 100 members of the
Mine-Mill, including Secretary-Trea-

of ‘Mine-’Mill{re repreted by I '

surer Maurice Travis, Vice-Presideni
Charles Wilson and Board Membel
Raymond Dennis.

: While the. congressitself was broad
in composition, a major theme of the
three-day session was"how to make the
peace movement in America even
broader. In this, of course, the labor
movement has a special job cut out
for itself. By now it is abundantly
clear that members of “progressive”
unions have no monopoly on the de-
sire for peace; that desire is strong in
the heart and mind of every union man.
Ways must be found to make it possi-
ble for the membership of even the
most conservative AFL and CIO unions
to express their deep-going desire for
peace.

Three steps -

Actually the paths to peace are far
simpler than they are made to seem
by the architects of U. S. “cold war”
policy. They can be summed up in
three steps, each one of which is com-
pletely in line with the peace policies
which this union has followed for the
last several years:

1) The full restoration of peace in
Korea.

2) Immediate negotiations through
the United Nations, among the five
major powers——including the Chi-
nese Republic—leading ‘to settle-
ment of all outstandinf differences.

3) An agreed and controlled disarm-
ament, and -elimination of weapons
of mass destruction. '

THESE ARE THE STEPS that can
_be taken without delay. We no.t.e with
satisfaction the resolution introduced
by 10 members of the U. S. Senate,
calling for world-wide disarmament.

As this convention opens, we are
more hopeful for the cause of peace
than we have been at any time in the
last few yea.rs.- We know that genuine,
permanent peace is possible. W.e are
determined to have it.

Agosto. El dia 26 de Agosto Cyrus

‘Help us to get our fnand free’

Here are e.rcerpts from the address
by Mine-Mill regional director Asbury
Howard, which the delegates agreed
was one of _.the high-spots of the con-
vent-ion:

tI"used to think that all my troubles
in this world came from being black.
Now, my skin has always been black
and it’s.going to stay black until I die.
So if I thought that was my trouble,
there could be no help for life, and no
help for others like me.

But I have learned different. I
started learning back in 1933 when we
began to build our ‘union. ‘The union
has been an education to me. With
our organized power, we changed‘ life
a lot since 1933; yet my skin has not
changed; it was black then and it’s
black now.

What h.as changed? Our power has
changed. We workers, white and
black, have found. that by sticking to-
gether as workers, we can make the
companies play a different tune.

MAYBE I CAN make this point bet-
ter if I let Mr. J. P. Morgan tell it.
You know J. P. Morgan once was
called in to testify before a commit-
tee of Congress. That'was back around

the time just before the first World -

War. And Morgan was so rich he
couldn't tell the committee just how
many workers were sweating to pro-
duce his pile of profits. That was be-
fore Harry Bridges and the longshore
workers had built their great union,
and thousands of longshoremen were
working for J. P. Morgan. So one of
the members of the committee asked
J. 11 Morgan this question: '

“Do you think $10 it week is enough
for a longshoreman to earn?”

Now let me read you the answer
this big boss gave. Listen to this:

“I do not.Icnow, sir. If that is all
he can get and he takes it,’ I should
think it was enough.”

What was he saying and admitting?

He wasladmittingp that we workers
get as much as we have the power
He was admitting that as long "as
the bosses are organized and the work-
ers are divided, profits will be high

and wages will be low.

And you know, it was just about at
that time when J .‘ P. Morgan and
Company bought the Tennessee Coal &
Iron _Company. Why did he.. want that
company? He wanted it because he
knew he .could inakevbigger profits in
the South by paying lower "wages. He

knew he could work the workers’

longer and harder. He wanted TCI
because the workers in the South had
less power than anywhere else in the
country. ‘V

WHY DID the workers have .less
power? Because they were divided,
divided into; whites and blacks. ’

And, who was dividing the Workers?
Who was keeping them-«apart? The

 had great power.

same J. P. Morgan and his Wall Street
pals.

When Morgan and his pals bount
their profits, they don't have two
piles; they don’t have one pile of
white dollars and another pile of black
dollars. ,

No, profits are just one big pile that
comes out of the workers’ backs} and
the more the bosses can divide us and

hold us down, the bigger the profit,

pile is.

What we workers get depends on
our organized power; and, brothers
and sisters, it's just plain common
sense that the workers as a whole are
going to have less power to deal with
the bosses if Negro workers and Mexi-
can-American workers are held down.

This is an old game of a handful of
men runnning the lives of the great
majority. It’s an old, old game. ,Let
me take you back to that convention
held in the city of Philadelphia in the
year 1787. Today, the writers -of his-'
tory must admit that was a secret con-
vention, a convention where owners

and bosses got together to decide how .

they were to control the majority.

AND AT THAT convention were “

slaveowners, a handful of men who
owned other men ‘and land, and who
They wanted to
protect their power, and here’s how
they did it. Look at Article I, Section
2 of the Constitution. It says that
each state was to have one represen-
tative in the house for every 30,000;
and it says that this “shall be deter-
mined by adding the whole number of
freelpersons . . . three-fifths of all
other persons.”

And what did that mean? It meant
that 8,000 ow-ners of land and slaves
had the vote, the ‘political power firm-
ly in their hands. If there were 5,-
000,000 slaves, 3,000,000 of these could
be used to entitle, their owners to elect
slave men to Congress. Eight thou-
sand slaveowners could elect 100 Con-

gressmen’ without even taking off ‘

their hats.-

With such power, a minority, a
handful of slaveowners, could run this
country against_the majority.

And they did!

They tried to spread their power
over the whole West and, yes, all over
South and Central America. They
made war on the people of Mexico in
1846 and had plans to make the whole
land a country of slaves. If you look
in the Congressional Record of Febru-
ary 23, 1949, you’ll see this note by
a Senator Foote of Mississippi:

“No one, acquainted with the vast
mineral resources of California and
New Mexico, and who is aware of the
peculiar adaptness of slave labor to
mining, can doubt for a moment, that
were slaves introduced into California
and New Mexico, for the purpose of
being employed in the mining opera-

tions there in progress . . . their la-

bor would result in . . . profits not
heretofore realized by the most suc-
cessful sugar planters of the coun-
try.”

YOU SEE, this handful of slave-
owners were planning to have slavery
in the whole West, and if they had
won, we would all have been working
as slaves——white and black, Mexicans——
all of us.

The President of the slave system,
Jefferson Davis, himself admitted that
they were the first to use the color of
a man's skin as an excuse to rob him
of the fruit of his labor.

“This, our new government,” he
said, “is the first in the history of the
world based on this great . . . moral
truth. Its" corner stone rests upon the
great truth that the Negro is not
equal to the white man and subordi-
nation to the superior race his natural
and normal condition.”

And when the slave system’ was no
more, the lords of Wall" Street kept
that lie alive, as an excuse to hold
down all the workers. And every time‘
there is a dirty deed to do in this

country against the workers and the ',

majority, we find the coalition of
Southern poll tax Congressmen and’

Senators lined up with labor hatersin  h

the Republican Party to throw a»
wrench in the path of progress.
Labor now has the organization, the

 

understanding and the experience to "

put an end to" the discrimination,

against Negroes and Mexican-Ameri-

cans and other sections of labor. All .. .
overthe world, Wall’ Street is finding. .-
it can no longer split‘ and divide. ‘A1l~

over the world, the people are" aroused
and fighting for peace, for security,
and for independence. And no uniop

is more prepared ‘and ready " and“ I

schooled to lead that fight than Mine-
Mill. - ‘ t  " 7

Speaking for the Negro workers,  
~say.we ask nospecialx privilege.‘ Just“: -
