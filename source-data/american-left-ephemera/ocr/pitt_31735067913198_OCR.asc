THE MINE-MILL Uh.—ON

I

Union Camllaigns for ‘Copper
County’ Name in New Jersey

Copper County should be the official name of Middlesex County, N.J., where more than a quar-
ter of the country’s refined copper is produced, believe Mine-Mill leaders in the area, who last month
launched a drive to publicize the importance of the industry both to the county and to the nation.

At a meeting with US. Rep. Edward J. Patten (D) on Nov. 15, the union spokesmen honored the
Congressmen for past service, while also attempting to enlist his support for the current campaign.
The appeal to Patten, who only a week before had been elected by a comfortable margin to his third
term in Congress, was only the first step in the effort to obtain support from community leaders,

said Alfred Petit-Clair, Mine-Mill
executive board member.

Petit - Clair, t o g e t h e r with
Thomas DeFederico and John
Infusino, presidents respectively
of Locals 837 in Carteret and 365
in Perth Amboy, the two largest
of Mine-Mill’s locals in the dis-
trict, expressed to Patten their
belief that it would be “only
proper that Middllesex County
receive the recognition that it de-
serves.” '

“No area in the country is
more vital to our economy,” de-
clared the union leaders in a
prepared statement. “Without
copper, our nation would not be
a first class power,” they added,

noting, “The metals we produce.

are used in the most advanced
industries, from space explora-
tion to national defense.”

Plaque Awarded

Big Delegations
Expected or
Jan. Convention

Mine-Mil1’s special convention
in Tucson, Ariz. next month
shapes up as one which will be
extremely well attended, judging
from the early response re-
ceived thus far from the con-
vention call. Virtually every lo-
cal union in the country is ex-
pected to be represented at the
affair, which will open Jan. 16
at the Pioneer International
Hotel.

The call to the convention, at
which delegates will discuss and
decide on the proposal to merge
with the United Steelworkers of
America, was mailed to each 10-
cal union towards the end of
November.

Accompanying the call were
copies of the proposed merger
agreement, a summary of that
agreement prepared by the gen-
eral counsels of the two unions,
and the Steelworkers’ constitu-
tion.

Steel Convention Approved

The proposal for the merger
of Mine-Mill and the Steelwork-
ers, which would strengthen
greatly the bargaining position
of labor in non-ferrous metals
industry negotiations, has been
endorsed by the executive boards
of both unions. Delegates to the
Steelworkers convention in Sep-
tember enthusiastically support-
ed the idea, giving the union’s
officers authority to work out
final details.

Mine-Mill locals throughout the
country will be discussing the
matter thoroughly at member-
ship meetings this month.

Delegates will be selected by
each local in the same way and
on. the same representational
basis as for the regular biennial
convention of the union. Since
copies of delegate credentials
must be in the hands of Interna-
tional Secretary - Treasurer Irv-
in'g Dichter at least 15 days prior
to the opening of the convention,
all locals will have to select
delegates by the end of this
month. - ,

4' Each local also should submit
its form, for hotel reservations

f'_to.-the Mine-Mill office in Den-
‘yer at least two weeks prior to ‘
,.th"e ‘opening of the convention.

" The special convention tenta-
tively is ..set to run for, three
days. . ,

;Under” terms of the proposed L
merger agreement, Mine - Mill _

would become an affiliate of the

THE MINE-MILL UNION

  Voters Give Republicans Broad Sweep;
G O P Gains 47 House, 3 Senate Seats

Statehouse Contests Also

Follow Trend Across U. S. 9

Despite the. lackluster campaigns waged in most
areas of the country, which virtually ignored many of
the major issues of concern, American voters turned out

. (in _.record numbers for a non-presidential election on

‘#18 and, with a vengeance, breathed renewed life into
..J'»Republican party. The voters’ actions, coming only
two years after the tremendous Lyndon Johnson sweep
of 1964, should enliven the prospects for both political
speculation and political action in the two years prior to

the presidential race of 1968.

Last month, Republicans made broad gains across
the country—making pickups of three seats in the U. S.
Senate and 47 in the Housegof Representatives, winning
23 gubernatorial batt1es—a gain of eight. In the state

legislatures, too, the GOP scored
strongly, winning about 41 per-
cent of the seats across the coun-
try, compared with 33 percent
two years ago. ’

State Legislatures

Democrats, who had controlled
both legislative - houses in 32
states prior to the election, now
hold that position in 24 states-—

V a net loss of eight. The GOP will

exercise control of 16 legisla-
tures—a gain of 10 over the pre-
vious six states. In eight states,
control is split between the par-
ties, with each dominating one
house.

Minnesota and Nebraska have
technically nonpartisan legisla-
tures, and in both states the out-

look is still for conservative dom- .

ination.

Two years ago, Democrats had
gained 38 seats in the U.S. House
of Representatives, giving the
party a 295 to 140 majority there.
Traditionally, prior to the 89th
Congress, the House has been a
roadblock_ to liberal legislation,
and it is feared that the 47-seat
GOP gain last month will again
make this the case. It slices the
Democrats-’ margin from 248 to
187‘and means that a coalition of
Republicans and Southern Dem-
ocrats again can dominate the
chamber. . .

In the Senate, the elections cut
the Democrats’ majority from
67-33 to 64-36, but the new GOP
Senators generally are classified
as members of the party's liber-
al wing.

Industrialist Charles P e r c y
(R) defeated liberal 18-year in-
cumbent .Paul Douglas (D) in

both by his progressive civil
rights stands and by his hardline
“hawk” foreign policy stance.

In Oregon, GOP Gov. Mark
Hatfield defeated Cong. Robert
Duncan (D) for the Senate seat
being vacated by Mrs. Maurine
B. Neuberger (D). This race was
seen as one of the few through-
out the country in which voters
could express themselves on the
Vietnam war. Hatfield, one of
two new “doves” in the Senate,
has been critical of the war,
while Duncan solidly supported
the administration policy in
Southeast Asia. Hatfield’s mar-
gin of about 52 percent to 48

percent, however, was not as

large as the lead he was thought
to enjoy early in the campaign.

Attorney Howard Baker, Jr.,
more of a middle of the road
Republican, defeated Gov. Frank
G. Celment (D) of Tennessee, in
a.,_ _ pset, giving the GOP the
Senate seat that Albert Gore (D)
had held.

Another freshman Senator, Ed-
ward W. Brooke (R), the attor-
ney. general of Massachusetts,
will be the first Negro to serve_
in the upper house since Recon-
struction. He fills the vacancy
left by the retiring Leverett Sal-
tonstall (R).

Metcalf Wins

In a race of key importance to
Mine-Mill, Sen. Lee Metcalf (D-
Mont.) was elected by a
healthy margin in a race with
incumbent Gov. Tim Babcock,
which had been rated as a toss-
up prior to Nov. 8; One of the
real fighters for the new federal
mine safety law, Metcalf‘ is one
of the Senate's solid liberals. He

Sen. Lee Mefcalf
Big Win for Liberals

was the only Senator up for re-
election in 1966 who a year ago
signed a statement calling for
the continuation of the 37-day
bombing pause in Vietnam as a
move for a more vigorous U.S.
peace offensive.

The union, however, lost in
some of its key campaigns. U.S.
Reps. David S. King (D-Utah)
and George F. (Duke) Senner,
Jr. (D-Ariz.) succumbed under
the Republican tide in both of
those states. Arizona Gov. Sam
Goddard, who was strongly sup-

ported by the Mine-Mill locals
there, lost to Mayor John R. Wil-
liams of Phoenix, a conservative
Republican.

Of 35 U.S. Senate seats up for
election, the GOP captured 18 to
the Democrats’ 17. Republicans
won 23 of a similar number of
gubernatorial contests, with the
Democrats winning 11. Neither
Howard H. Callaway (R) nor
Lester G. Maddox (D) got a ma-
jority of the votes for governor
in Georgia, and that contest is
still up in the air. Although the
state’s constitution provides that
the legislature will choose be-
ween the two top vote-getters in
such cases, a federal court has
stated that this cannot be done
because of the malapportion-
ment of the legislature.

GOP Liberals Win

Combined with two holdovers,
the Republican gubernatorial
victories add up to a total of 25
governorships, including those in
the most populous states. Nelson
Rockefeller and George Romney,
members of the GOP’s liberal
wing, won impressive victories
in New York and Michigan re-
spectively. Ronald Reagan, who
defeated Edmund (Pat) Brown
(D) for the governorship of Cali-
fornia, now the nation’s most

IUD Sfauffer C ommiﬂee
Looks to ‘67 Bargaining

DENVE R, Colo.—Some 30
delegates from seven different
international unions, meeting at
the Cosmopolitan Hotel here on
Nov. 14, updated the common
bargaining program being
worked out for Stauffer Chem-
ical Company negotiations and
agreed that the close communi-
cation between unions involved
is an essential element of future
success. The delegates decided,
too, that formal expressions of
support for coordinated bar-
gaining, under the auspices of
the AFL-CIO’s Industrial Union
Department, shouldbe obtained
from the memberships of the
various local unions.

Such votes, it was felt, would
strengthen the bargaining power
of the group, which already this
year has produced contracts su-
perior to those won in normal
single plant negotiations.

Among the bargaining goals
established are substantially im-
proved pensions, including high-
er basic benefits, vesting after
10 years of service, and widow’s

‘benefit; severance pay; 10 paid

holidays; shift differentials of 20
cents per hour; a cost of living
clause; improved vacations; and
an improved non - contributory
health and welfare program. The
1967 bargaining program is ex-
pected to be finalized at a Hous-
ton, Texas meeting of the com-
mittee on Feb. 15.

nator for the IUD, chaired the
meeting. Mrs. Gheretein Wilson
presented financial information
on the company, indicating that
first-half profits for 1966 stood
at $18.59 million, as compared
to $17.36 million for the same
period. the previous year. Stanf-
fer, she said, which is beginning

to show the results of its major

program to diversify and broad-
en its product lines, increased

its profits by almost 25 percent

in 1965, and the upwards trend
continues.

Earlier this year, several 10-
cals, including Mine-Mill Locals
50- and.266 in San Francisco and
Richmond, Calif. respectively,
signed contracts that will expire
on June 30, 1968-a date near
which some 10 Stauffer agree-
ments will terminate.

 

 

populous state, provided con-
servatives with their biggest win
of the day. Reagan, it is felt,
benefitted to some extent from
the so-called “white backlash,”
which, other than in the deep
South, failed to show up with as
much strength as anticipated in
other sections of the country.

In Maryland, for example,

Spiro T. Agnew (R) topped by

some 82,000 votes George P. Ma-
honey (D), whose campaign was
based largely on his opposition
to fair housing legislation, in the
gubernatorial contest. Winthrop
Rockefeller (R) won the Arkan-
sas governorship over arch-seg-
regationist Jim Johnson (D).

Mrs. Lurleen Wallace (D), on
the other hand, won a smashing
victory in gaining the Alabama
governorship. Her husband
George already is threatening to
enter the 1968 presidential skir-
mishes under the banner of seg-
regation. Claude R. Kirk, Jr.
parlayed M a h o n e y’s phrase
‘.‘Your house is your castle” into
victory in the Florida guberna-
torial contest. The conservative
Republican upset Miami Mayor
Robert King High (D).

Some Negro Gains

While the 1966 results indicate
that increased Negro registra-

tion in the South is still far from »

sufficient to offset appeals to
racism, a few limited gainswere,
made. In Macon County, Ala-
bama, for 'example, Lucius An-
derson became the first Negro
sheriff in the South since Re-
construction. In the same state,
Negro voters contributed heavily
to the victory of Wilson Baker,
Selma’s safety director, over
Sheriff Jim Clark.

In Texas, Mrs. Barbara Jor-\
dan was elected to the state Sen-

ate, and Curtis Graves and Jo-" 

seph Lockridge, also Negroes,
won House seats. Six Negroes
were elected to the Tennessee
House of Representatives. Julian
Bond was named again to the

legislature in Georgia, .d_espite-x-.

the fact that he has twice been
denied that seat because of his
outspoken foreign policy views.
The 56 million voters who
turned out across the country
on Nov. 8 (a little over 48" per-
cent of the estimated number
of -potential voters) established
a record high for a midterm
election. On a nationwide basis,
Republicans outpolled the Demo-
crats by more than four million
votes.

THE MINE-MILLL UNION

GOP Win in Arizona Includes
acked Mine Inspector

Arizona Gov. Sam Goddard and Congressman George F. (Duke) Senner, Jr.,
endorsed by the Arizona Mine-Mill Council and strongly supported by the union’s locals
throughout the state, went down to defeat on Nov. 8, as Republicans captured seven
of the nine top offices in the state as well as control of the legislature. The GOP
state-wide winners included a union-endorsed Bisbee miner, Verne McCutchan, who
was elected as the new Arizona mine inspector.

' The only two top-line Democrats to remain in office are Morris Udall, Congress-

were thought to have played a
role in the Republican sweep by
cutting down the potential voter
turnout.

Defeating Goddard by a
189,742 to 160,798 vote was Jack
Williams, a former Phoenix
mayor and a Goldwater con-
servative, whose win
trouble for labor-sponsored leg-
islation in the next two years.
The loss makes Goddard the
state’s only one-term governor
since 1941.

During the liberal Democrat’s
single term, he was able to act
as a balance against the con-
servative-inclined state legisla-
ture. Although the Democrats
controlled both houses, a coali-
tion of Republicans and Demo-
cratic conservatives established
a majority rule. Even so, God-
dard was able to enact 56 per-
cent of the legislation that he
backed.

Labor also lost a strong ally

when - Senner failed in his bid"

for a third term. Sam Steiger,
television personality and a for-

immigration reforms, anti-pov-

and many other progressive
bills.

A major union victory was re-
corded, however, with the elec-
tion of McCutchan, a member
of Mine-Mill Local 551 in Bis-
bee. Roy Hershey, the Demo-
cratic incumbent, had been
sternly criticized by Mine-Mill
locals for his role as state mine
inspector, particularly following
the death of Zeke Sanchez, a
member of the Miami Miners’
Union, on Sept. 29. Hershey fi-
nally admitted that the Arizona
mine ' safety code was unen-
forceable, after Mine-Mill
charged -.that -.the _Christmas
Mine of the Inspiration Consoli-
dated Copper Co. was, in effect,
a death trap. The Arizona Mine-
Mill Council later endorsed Mc-
Cutchan for the safety job.

dorsed candidates, most of
whom were Democrats.

President's Column

The Merger convention

by A. C. Skinner

HE CALL to the January special convention in Tucson, Arizona
was mailed to all local unions last month. Accompanying
each convention call was a copy of the proposed terms of merger
-— a document which is the ‘result of many meetings and delibera- ,
tions between your international officers, the international officers ‘
of the United Steelworkers, and attorneys for both unions. The
document by itself, however, will not produce an effective and
principled merger. This will only be achieved when we pool the
strength of our members and the Steel members, especially those
in the non-ferrous metals industry, into a united bargaining force.

This should be the objective of our convention next month and
of the 1967 Non-ferrous Metals Conference. This is the prime pl§'~""'\.—
pose of the proposed merger. Except for the serious recognitior. \
of this overriding principle, how else could two unions that have
been bitter rivals for 16 years have been brought together? Since
last March, the question of reuniting labor in the non-ferrous
metals industry was”the motivating force in these merger discus-
sions between the Steel and Mine-Mill officers.

An Agreement of Substance

ET ME REPEAT what I have said at many Mine-Mill meetings
during the past few months. It is to the everlasting credit of
the new Steel officers — President Abel, Vice-President Molony,
and Secretary-Treasurer Burke — that this proposed merger will
go before our convention as an agreement ’
of both substance and principle, for the
benefit of the memberships of both Mine-
Mill and Steel.

This agreement, our officers believe,
demonstrates‘ a recognition by the officers
and executive board of one of the largest
unions in the world that a relatively small,
but militant organization can make a con-
siderable contribution tq the United Steel-
workers of America and to the labor
movement. This merger can do this be-
cause it will unite into one union some 75
to 80 percent of the organized working
force in the non-ferrous industry in the United States. It also can
contribute to uniting all other unions in a common bargaining effort
in this industry next year. That such a force for unity in the in-
dustry is needed was expressed by 320 delegates to the IUD Coppe
and Brass Conference in Chicago in October. —

 

Skinner

The Chicago Conference

INE MILL’S 99 delegates to this conference heard informative
talks about the proposed merger from USWA Vice-President
Joseph Molony and Secretary-Treasurer Walter Burke. Y o u r
president was invited and spoke to the conference of some 200
Steel delegates. :
A joint cocktail party that same evening brought together‘
all Steel and Mine-Mill delegates, and I’m sure almost everyone
who participated would agree that it was a most amazing experi-
ence. If anyone had predicted a. year ago that this could happen,
he would have been regarded as some kind of nut. I think our
experience at the Chicago meetings proved the deep recognition
and desire for unity that exists in the ranks of almost every union
in North America.

Spokesmen for Management

F WE NEED any further evidence of the correctness of. our

merger efforts, we can find them in editorials and stories

expressing the viewpoint of management. The Engineering &_

Mining Journal said last month, “Union merger spells trouble for
copper,” stating that “a massive union alliance‘ is rolling toward _
a 1967 bargaining confrontation with the copper and brass in'- _

dustry,” etc., etc. Business Week said, “Employers can expect
troubles such as they haven’t faced for many a year in 1967 '
bargaining,” etc., etc. , . _ _ .

Of course, the simple fact is that neither the Mine-Mill—Steel ,
merger nor IUD»; efforts to coordinate bargaining spells w 
for any company that is interested in genuine collective barga’ I‘
and substantial settlements. We believe, however, that these in;
developments will put an end to company efforts at “whipsanr *
bargaining” and the playing of one union against a ther..If this ,
is what worries many mining companies, then they should be-'“.~::

epuliliean Sweep Ileleais King;
GOP controls Legistlature in Utah

Utah voters in the 2nd Congressional District last month de-

. feated the bid for re-election of a strong supporter of mine safety

legislation, Rep. David S. King. Despite the solid support he re-
ceived from five Mine-Mill locals and from other unions in his dis-
trict, the liberal Democrat received only 39 percent of the vote.
Sherman Lloyd, classified as a moderate Republican, won the House

seat, polling 94,900 votes to King’s 60,547 tally.

Organized labor had viewed King’s re-election as crucial. Elect-
ed in 1964, he had supported, in addition to mine safety, federal

aid to education, medicare, anti-
poverty programs, repeal of Sec-
tion 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley
ﬁg Jaw, and other progressive mea-
}“"““~jj_res. ’ S
L Union members worked stren-
uously during the election cam-
paign. Active were Mine-Mill Lo-
cals 392 and 692 in Magna, Local
485 in Bingham, Local 55 in Too-
ele, and Local 876 with its mem-
bership living in both Salt Lake
City and the Tooele area. The
result of this work was most evi-
dent in Magna and Tooele, where
there are the heaviest concen-
trations of union members. Mag-
na had the best voter turn out of
any area in Salt Lake County,
with some precincts registering
as much as 90 percent participa-
tion, Of the seven counties in
King’s district, only Tooele af-
forded him a majority vote—a
plurality of about 2,500.

But Utah, like so many other
states, was engulfed in a gen-
eral Republican s w e e p, and

' strong Democratic votes in Mag-
na and Tooele were not enough
to reverse the overall trend.

Republicans Gain Control

An example of this sweep is
reﬂected in the new make-up of
the state legislature. The Repub-
licans now control both houses-

23 to 5 -in the Senate and 59'

to 10 in the House. Both had pre-
viously been controlled by the
Democrats, by 15 to 12 in the
Senate and a 38-31 margin in the
H o u s e. Democratic Governor
Calvin L. Rampton, whose term
of office ends in 1968, was not
up for re-election this year.

Solidly liberal U. S. Sen. Lee Metcalf, a major supporter in the ultimately success-

17,000—vote margin Republican Gov. Tim Babcock, an ultra conservative, in a race that

had been viewed as being razor-thin.

More "Right-to-Work" Threats

Backers of state “right-to-work” laws have become more opti-
mistic about passage of union shop bans as a result of the GOP
gains in last month’s general election. The National Right-to-Work
Committee is now talking of renewed legislative efforts in Cali-
fornia, New Mexico, Montana, Idaho, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and
other states. Newly acquired Republican control of many legisla-
tures and statehouses is viewed by the RTW committee as an
indication of easier sledding for anti-union legislation.

"Green Carders" on the Rise

Unions in this country have vowed to fight the daily importation
of Mexican workers. The “green-carders,” who hold resident-alien
permitsallowing unrestricted border crossings, have been charged
with holding wages down and strike-breaking activities. Some
43,000 Mexican workers enter the U. S. every day to work, return-
ing to their homes across the border at night—a figure that is up
from the 34,000 of three years ago. Unions here plan a legal test
of such commuting. * * *

Substitute for Sick Pay?

A British company, in an attempt to reduce absenteeism
among its 1,700 employees, has devised a system of raffling off
cameras, refrigerators, and electric mixers worth nearly $500

week period receive a ticket to participate in the drawing.

Cash awards for these ideas amounted to $24.5 million in 1965.

The Detroit Police Officers Association has filed an unfair

An Election Analysis

Political Parties Must Learn
To Deal with Tough Issues

Three tough issues—the war in Vietnam, the continuing racial tensions within
the United States, and the rising cost of living——must be squarely faced by progressive
Congressmen and Senators who hope to be re-elected, the Mine-Mill international ex-
ecutive board warned in August, while urging all local unions to play active roles in

the 1966 political campaign.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Theodore C. Sorensen, a former special counsel to President John F. Kennedy,
had much the same thing to say—after the fact of the broad Republican sweep of
Nov. 8. In a hard-hitting analysis, he told a group of party faithful that Democrats
-were defeated across the country “because our party had already lost direction,
enthusiasm and momentum—because the difficult issues of war and peace, inflation

and recession, and black and
white had not been placed in
true perspective for the Ameri-
can electorate.” Democrats, in
other words, had not provided
meaningful answers to these
three key issues.

A vague, but wide voter un-
easiness with respect to such
important subjects was suffi-
cient to cause the greater-than-
usual non-presidential-year loss
of seats to the party in power.
Netting gains of 47 in the House
of Representatives and three in
the -U.S. Senate, the Republicans
also increased by eight the
number of governorships held
by the party and made major
gains in the state legislatures
across the nation.

it it it

The GOP House gains partic-
ularIy’§péll"tro‘uble for any for-
ward-looking domestic program
of legislation in the next two
years. A sizeable number of the
notable achievements of the 89th
Congress were passed by mar-
gins of 25 or fewer votes in the
House. The coalition of Republi-
cans and conservative Demo-
crats there is now numerically
"back in the saddle.

To ‘completely write off the
new 90th Congress as a reac-
tionary one, however, would be
a mistake at this time. For the
possibility exists that the Re-

“publican party, with its eye on
the White House in 1968, will
not be a completely negative
force in the Congress. The Ri-
_pon Society, an organization of
liberal Republicans, rejects any

interpretation of 1966 GOP gains.

as“‘a mandate to dismantle or
obstruct at every point the pro-
grams of the ‘Great Society,’ ”

- "maintaining that such an inter-

pretation simply invites Repub-
lican losses two years from
now. _

It should be noted that the
Republican. freshmen in- th e
House, a total of 59, are ex-
pected in general to be m o r e
progressive than the 48 Repub-
lican incumbents who were de-
feated in 1964. Many of the
newcomers this year rode to
victory on the coattails of new

in Republican governors and Sen-

ators, who, for the most part,
are members of -the party’s
moderate rather th an right-
pwing element. Of the major
GOP winners, Ronald Reagan

“The c ritic al stake in the

Joseph Kraft wrote from Wash-

8, “does not turn on the struggle
between the parties for seats in

mansions. The true battle lies

is whether the party leader-
ships can be kept sufficiently
fluid to make American politics
relevant to the rapidly changing
outlook of the electorate.”

The real question left by the
results of 1966 is “Will the party
leaderships realize that th e y
have to deal with the to ugh
questions of today?” With the
White House at stake in 1968,

both parties have an oppor-

tunity for growth in the next
an opportunity
to learn from the election just
past.

=11 ii: *

The Viet Nam war, everyone
will agree, is a tough question
for a politician, as is the cost-
of-living rise that stems, in
large part, from that extremely
expensive war. These were is-
sues that most candidates
ducked in 1966.

In this regard, however, it is
interesting to e x a m in e the
fortunes of those House
incumbents considered In 0 s t
vulnerable this year -— the 47
Democratic freshmen elected in
1964, when their party made a
net gain of 38 seats. Twenty-
three of the freshmen, nearly 50

percent, held on to their seats
in spite of the Republican
sweep — a performance that
was better than expected.

A great majority of those 23
— some 85 percent — took posi-
tions on “tough” questions that
went beyond their support for
‘Great Society’ programs. Most
of them spoke out for a step-up
in U.S. efforts to negotiate in
Viet Nam.

The great majority — some
90 percent — of the 24 Demo-
cratic freshmen whose Congres-
sional seats reverted to the GOP
in 1966 took no such “indepen-
dent” positions, but instead
ducked the “tough” issue.

*3 it it

This is the lesson of which
Sorensen speaks — that the‘ real
issues must be dealt with. This
undoubtedly is what K r a ft
means when he says that Amer-
ican politics must become “rele-
vant to the rapidly changing
outlook of the electorate.”

Former Vice-President Rich-
ard Nixon, a far cry from a
“dove,” already has r a t h e r
sadly predicted that the Re-
publicans will try “to outbid
the Democrats for the p e a c e
vote” in 1968 if the war is still
going on at that time.

It is greatly to be hoped that
both parties might have learned
the lessons of 1966 by then.
American voters want the op-
portunity to express themselves
on such issues. It is up to the
political parties to provide that
opportunity.

Local 890 Shorws Muscle G
In New Mexico Election

BAYARD, N. M.—E. S. (Johnny) Walker, strongly backed by

‘ Mine-Mill Local 890, won a second term in Congress by a narrow

margin of 2,122 votes of the 247,478 cast inphis state-wide contest on
Nov. 8. His majority in Grant County, which bucked a trend that
produced major GOP gains in the state, was 2,219.

The above figures testify to the important role played by the

local, one of the union's most politically active.

Additionally,

Steve Ray Aguirre and Edith Vesely, the only two Democrats to

face Republican opposition in

-local races, were supported by

the union and emerged vic-
torious.

Aguirre, a former Kennecott
employee who was a member
of Local 890, defeated John
Martin by a 3,725 to 2,666 count
to win re-election as county
sheriff. He is the first Mexican-
American to hold that position.
Re-elected to the state Senate,
Mrs. Vesely edged Jack Hamil-
ton by a 3,140 to 3,037 majority.

Cargo Wins in Upset

On a state-wide level, on the
other hand, the GOP made sub-
stantial gains, paced by David
F. Cargo’s decisive upset win
over Gene Lusk in the guber-
natorial contest. Although Local

890 backed Lusk and the top of
the Democratic ticket generally,‘
Cargo is considered to be a‘
liberal Republican.

/C;-“V.

Republicans, too, made gains‘;

in the state legislature, although
the Democrats will still control
both houses—the House by a 45
to 25 margin, the Senate by 24
to 17. The party’s majorities
had been 59 to 18 and 28 to 4
respectively. ’

-

In the race for the U. S. Sen- A

ate, Clinton P. Anderson (D)’
won re-election in a surprising-
ly close contest against GOP
challenger Anderson C a r t e r.
Thomas G. Morris (D), endorsed
by Local 890, won re-election as
the state’s other Congressman.
He defeated Schuble C. Cook.

Province Wage Levels at
Stake in Nigadoo Strike

BATHURST, New Brunswick—-
After attempting for over a year
to force the Sullivan mining
group into meaningful negotia-
tions at its Nigadoo River Mine,
members of the Nigadoo and
District Mine-Mill Workers Un-
ion, Local 1043, went on strike
on Oct. 22. Round the clock pick-
et lines have been maintained at
the property for seven weeks.

Initially certified as bargain-
ing agent in June of 1965, the 10-
cal has had to fight four at-
tempts by the company since
then to have the union decerti-
fied by the New Brunswick La-
bour Board. Even after the ques-
tion of the right to bargain was
again determined by a certifica-
tion vote in June of this year,
the company still refused to
make any reasonable contract
proposals.

Prior to the walkout, the union
went through long and unproduc-

board report, if accepted by the
union, would have meant a wage
scale ranging from 25 to 60 cents
per hour below existing rates in
the area, and 50 to 60 cents an
hour less than Mine-Mill rates at
the nearby Wedge Mine.

Morale among the 156 Nigadoo
workers is high, as the strike
enters its eighth week. Wide-
spread support has developed
among other unions, which re- ‘

alize that the general wage "

structure and working conditions
in the entire province depend on
success in the Nigadoo strike.

» 4‘ ‘Copper Production Cufbackin Zambia

Last month Zambian copper mines were forced to cut back
production, and are now operating at only two-thirds of normal.
Production last year, 758,000 tons, was second only to the U. S.
The cutback was forced by a shortage of coal to fire the smelters.
The coal shortage resulted from a shortage of rail cars.

Zambia is seeking to ship as much copper as possible by routes
by-passing white supremacist Rhodesia and has diverted cars to
rail lines running to Portugese ports on the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans. Rhodesia, source of the needed coal, has retaliated by re-
quiring that for e\ ery carload of coal moving across the border
into Zambia, an empty must at the same time move to Rhodesia.

Zambia has ordered more coal cars and also is pushing devel-
opment of its own coal mines, but the coal shortage is expected to
last for several months at least.

New Chemical Refining Process Tried

A copper refinery, utilizing a new chemical process, was placed
in-operation at Bagdad, Arizona recently. The plant is operated by
Arizona Chemcopper Co., a joint venture of Bagdad Copper Corp.
and the Chemetals Corp. of Phoenix. The refinery has a capacity
of 25. tons of copper per day,and operates on cement copper pro-
duced by Bagdad.

The cement copper is dissolved with sulfuric acid, forming a

copper sulfate solution. Copper is precipitated out in a pressure-

vessel into “which hydrogen is injected. The plant turns out a cop-
per powder said to be better than 99.95 percent pure on an oxygen-
free basis. The powder can be used in the powder metal industry
and in other applications.

' . The process is saidito be competitive with smelting and refin-
ing -from the standpoint of production costs and to "involve sub-
stantially less in the way of capital outlay.

Bridge Plot Tied fo Copper Price

Rising and ﬂuctuating copper prices have stimulated a rash of
criminal activity. Hundreds of thefts of copper have been reported
over the past. year. Copper rain gutters and drainpipe, bronze
cemetery gates, warehouse stocks of copper, copper transmission
lines, plumbing fittings and copper in other forms have been stolen
.by thieves who have found 'a ready market for their loot at scrap
dealers. One man was electrocuted while trying to steal wire from

--;;,_‘i'a high voltage line.

‘Last month, two men were arrestedby the F.B.I. for plotting

_  up a mile-long railroad bridge in Zambia. This would have

cut thefiroute over which much of Zambia’s copper production
reaches theieutside world. Arrested were Rolf Duenbier, New York
manager of a ‘German metal trading firm, and Jay Elliott, an
employee. ~ ‘

The F.B.I. charged the two with attempting to bribe two
Miami, Florida marine engineers who operate a furniture store.
_They allegedly offered $25,000 plus expenses to.blow_ up the bridge.
But instead of accepting, the Marine engineers tipped. off the F.B.I.
‘The plot violated a 50-year-old federal law prohibiting conspiracy
to injure or destroy private property -in .a foreign country with
which the U. S. is atpeace. ’ ' '

The accused men have remained mum since their arrest.
Investigators theorized that the accused either had guessed wrong
in commodity exchange speculation in copper and were holding
. copper for which they had paidmore than the present price, or else
were intending to purchase copper just before the bridge was blown
up. Destruction of the bridge, they apparently expected, ‘would cur-
tail shipments of copper from Zambia and drive up its ‘price in
‘London and New ‘York’. ‘ ' . ‘

of copper per year in concentrate form.

Three Japanese smelters will soon extend $20 million in loans
to assist infinancing. The loans will be paid off over a term of 15
years, beginning in 1970, by shipment of 44,000 tons per year of

Cufback in Foreign Zinc Production

Leading foreign zinc producers cut back production in late
October and early November. The Engineering and Mining Journal
says the cuts were agreed to at a meeting of non-U. S. producers
in Brussels, Belgium, and that 10 percent seems to have been the
agreed-upon reduction. Belgium and German producers were the
first to cut, and next Consolidated Mining and Smelting Co. closed
down its HB zinc-lead mine in Salmo, B. C. Other Canadian pro-
ducers followed with 10 percent cuts. These include Mattagami,
Orcham, Noranda, Normetal and Quemont.

Hudson Bay said its zinc production was going down because
of declining grade of ore and said no further cuts were contem-
plated. More recently some French, Spanish,’ British, and Aus-
tralian producers have cut back.

The cuts were motivated by a buildup in producers’ zinc stocks
which, if continued, it was feared, would lead to softening in the
price of zinc. In the United States, demand has continued strong
and no U. S. producers have announced cutbacks. Because of the
cutbacks in Canada and overseas, however, offerings of cut-rate
foreign zinc are said to be fast disappearing in New York.

1964 Great Falls

Arbitration Win

Upheld by Court

BUTTE, Mont.-—U. s. District

Judge Russell E. Smith last-

month upheld an arbitration
award won by the Great Falls
Mill and Smeltermen’s Union
more than two years ago. The

decision involves an Aug. 1, ,

1964, finding by Arbitrator
Thomas H. Tongue that the
Anaconda Company violated
seniority provisions of the ex-
isting contract by the manner
in which employees were re-
called back to work following a
two-week strike earlier in the
year.

In issuing his ruling, Judge
Smith denied motions by both
the union and the company to
make a financial judgment on
the amount of back pay due.
Instead, he referred the matter
back to the arbitrator, ordering
both parties to continue arbi-
tration until it is decided who
will receive back pay and in
what amounts. »

The strike, which lasted from
Jan. 30 to Feb. 12, 1964, resulted
when workers in the furnace
refinery department refused to
work on a new vertical furnace
until questions of wages and
working conditions were settled.
In retaliation, the company dis-
charged every worker in the
department, and a general work
stoppage resulted.

Unfair Recall

Immediately after the plant
was reopened, the local union
filed a grievance, charging that
the men had not been recalled
according to their seniority. The
grievance was taken to arbitra-
tion, which resulted in the 
ing that the company should
pay‘ back wages to employees

who were not recalled in their '
_.proper order. When Anaconda

refused payment, the union took
the matter to a federal court to
obtain an order for compliance.
Mine-Mill Local 16 estimates
that the award should affect
more than 90 members, with
the back pay amounting to’
about $3,500. V

Charles V. Huppe, an attorney

from Helena, handled the court ‘

case for the union.

Kennecott Subsidiary Rapped on Recent Shaft Death

The accidental death of William A. Macom, former financial secretary of Mine-Mill Local 944, in
the shaft of the _Ozark Lead Company’s mine near Ellington, Mo. on Nov. 3 was caused by the fact
that no overhead protection was provided, a US.‘ Bureau of Mines report on the fatality states. The
accident, which was reported in the last issue of the Mine-Mill Union, was investigated by R. D.
Bradford, of McAlester, Okla., subdistrict manager for the Bureau of Mines.

“Inasmuch as overhead protection in the form of a heavy steel frame and canopy has been built
since the accident (our _emphas2's—Ed'ito'r), and orders for its use at all times when men work in
the shaft have been issued,” Bradford. said in his report, “no further recommendations are offered.”

Provision of overhead protection for men working in shafts from skips or cages has _long been

recommended by the Bureau _of Mines. Its" Miners Circular 53, “Accidents from Hoisting and Haul-

age at ‘Metal and Non-Metallic
Mines,” for example, ~states,

Luck off-Ventilation - 
Causes_Two Deaths

Two miners—Willis A. Finch,

; 53, of Milford, Utah and Calvin

Semallie, 44, of . Cimmarron,

Ariz.—died of carbon monoxide
_ poisoning on Oct. 19 atthe Cac-

tus-Mine, about 20 miles west

and north of Milford in Beaver

County, Utah. The mine had shut
, down in 1912, and_clean-up work

preparatory to underground dia-

mond drilling had been in prog-
, ress with a four-man crew since
, Aug. 1.

The project was a joint ven-
ture of Tintic Standard Mining
Company and New York and
Honduras ‘Rosario Mining Com-
pany, with Cameron Mining

. Company as contractor.

The U.S. Bureau of Mines in-
vestigated the fatal accident,
_ and has issued a hard-hitting re-

port pointing up the many serious
lsafety.hazar'ds» which existed at
_ the mine. A federal mine safety
code, not yet promulgated, would
have prevented operation of the
mine until such hazards had
"been. eliminated, and thus the
two deaths can be attributed’ to
e the fact that the federal mine
safety program is notyet in op-
eration. '

The mine was ‘subject to the
jurisdiction of the Utah Industri-
al Commission, which has re-
sponsibility for enforcing the
mine safety laws and code. After
thedeaths of Finch and Semal-
lie, the",Commission placed" a

closure" order on the Cactus

he two men, working on the

.. night‘ shift, proceeded with‘ a _ .
diesel.-p_owered: loading machine‘ ’

to apoint about 4000 feet in by A

They were‘ founddead at this
point after Finch’s ‘wife tele-
phoned the minﬁ\eAforeman'son1e-

time after the’-end of the shift
that her husband hadnot re-
turned. _  * ; -~ -« '

Rescue workers, wearing oxy-
gen masks supplied by the Mil-

ford and Cedar City Fire De- '
‘T partments; were unable’ to re-

move, the bodies of the victims
before the masks’ oxygen sup-
plies were exhausted. U.S. Bu-
reau of Mines personnel with
Chemox one-hour apparatus
from Salt Lake City finally
brought the bodies to the portal.

The tunnel was not ventilated
by mechanical means and de-
vices fortesting the quality of

the air were not provided. The

Bureau of Mines stated that cav-

ing, probably in the upper lev- ‘

els, caused air movement in the
tunnel to stop. This condition,
coupled with a falling barometer
