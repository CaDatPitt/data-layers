DENVER-——Thirty thousand Mine-Mill members went on strike last month against f?_;-f
five major copper producing companies. A s the Mine-Mill Union_ went to press on Aug-

profits keep soaring at their
expense.”

The issue was placed thus
by the Bargaining Co-ordinat-
ing committee of the Interna-
tional Executive board which
met here on August 22 and 23.
Members of the committee are
President John Clark, Vice-
President Orville Larson, Sec-
retary-Treasurer Irving Di_ch-

TWELVE STATES

Struck ~by Mine-Mill local
unions between August 10 and
August 21 were Kennecott
Copper, Anaconda, American
Smelting and Refining, Phelps

San Manuel Copper. The strike
shutdown all operations in
Texas, Arizona, New Mexico,
California, Colorado,‘ Montana,

The decision to strike, said
the board committee, “was
not made without serious con-
sideration of all the factors
involved.”
cause “four months of nego-
tiations failed to produce a sin-
-gle _firm, negotiable offer of
settlement.”

The giant copper producers
did not even claim inability to
pay, the bargaining co-ordina-
tors said. They called the
companies’ position “even
more brazen in that no rea-
son whatsoever has been given
for refusing to make counter
proposals. Twice since negotia-

tions began, the union has"

drastically revised, its demands
in order that -no conceivable
effort on our part to reach a
settlement would be left un-
tried.” .

The committee pointed to
the “scornful and provocative”
replies of the companies,

SUPERIOR, Ariz.-—The first arbitration case, ever  

handled at Magma Copper company in nearly a half-cen- -
tury of operations was Won here last month by Superior  ,
Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers Union No. 938. . - ~ 1,

August 19, the date the arbitrator’s decision was re- 

ceived, thus became the
third event in as many
years to make labor history in
Superior.

Exclusive bargaining rights -‘
, for the workers in Magma

Copper, at that time‘ the big-
gest unorganized mining prop-
erty in America, were won by
Mine-Mill on Oct. 30, 1957.
That historic event brought to
a close the period of 46 years
in which Magma Copper oper.
ated without a union.
CONTRACT

I-Iistory was again written
in Superior 'on June 18, 1958,
when Magma Copper company
officials signed their first con-
tract with any union, Mine-Mill
Local 938, ending an era of
absolute domination by this
major copper producer over its
workers. Written into that
contract were long-denied ba-
sic gains such as grievance
and arbitration p r o c e d u r e s
never known at Magma before
Mine-Mill organized it. It was
that contract which made this
third historic event possible
for the first time at Magma—-
the fighting of a‘ grievance
through arbitration and win-
ning it. ‘ ’

Local 938 members Serafin
Herrera and Raymond Lobato,
underground miners, were giv-

=‘This is the question which
--‘everyone in labor circles is
asking with the passage of the

could hand labor its worst
licking since the days, of the
enactment of Taft- Hartley.
And the hysteria surrounding
debate on the bill was equal
to 1947.

The coalition of southern
Democrats and northern Re-
publicans were immensely aid-
ed by President Eisenhower’s
television address. But this
was not the whole story. It
was a lack of proper offensive
on the part of all labor and
the liberal bloc in the House

lowed the Landrum-Griffin

WHAT FRIENDS?

It seems quite obvious that
the AFL-CIO in the early

stages took too easy an ap-'

proach on the seriousness of
this latest anti-labor drive. Too
much reliance was placed on
“friends” in Congress rather
than on grass roots action
back home.

By the time the AFL-CIO
awoke, the NAM and the
Chamber of Commerce had a
high-powered operation going.
Mail into Congress from “out.
raged” individuals on isolated

 

 

instances of so-called racket-
eering reached tremendous
proportions. The hearings and
the reports of the McClellan
committee were timed to do
the cause of labor the most
harm. Most newspapers grad-
ually built up the tension and
added to the hysteria. Labor
representatives c on ta ctin g
Congressmen were made to
appear as committing a‘ major
crime, although it is well-
known that big business lob-

sands of dollars yearly in pres-

suring Congress.

Wins Settlement

More than two months of
negotiations got no offer from

- the company whatever. Less

than two days of direct action
won 29 cents an hour. That,
in a nutshell, is the story of
the new 3-year contract settle-
ment just made by Danville,
111., Local 808 with the Allith
Prouty company covering
nearly 400 metal fabricating
workers. ‘

.The Mine-Mill local’s old
contract expired on July 6.
Union negotiations with the
company had been going on
for several weeks prior to that
date, and up to August 17
after that date, without the
company coming up with any

‘offer. Finally on Aug. 18,

after Local’ 808 threatened to
take strike action unless man-
agement moved from its no»

- give position, the company of-

fered wage increases of 5 cents
an hour next, January, 1960, 6
cents in June, 1960, and 7 cents

in June of 1961.

.At a meeting that same

night,’ the membership re-

jected the offer and voted to

strike the next day. August
919 am., the men were out

and the plant was down. By

I -,1:O0— p.m. the same day, nego-
tiations ‘were resumed and a

new agreement was quickly
reached.

The 3-year contract settle-

hour general wage increase

 retroactive to July 6 when the

additional cents per hour for
health and welfare to be ap-

~ plied any way the union wants;

Corporations Raising Phony,

Issue - Management Rights

 

DEN VER——“Management rights,” raised high by the companies in this year’s con-"3:

tract negotiations, is labeled a “phony issue”

leasedlast month.

The “right to manage” issue being pushed in both non-ferrous metals and“'ste#eli

industry bargaining “is. obviously part of the grand strategy of American corporate;

interests _ to clip 1abor’s
wings in 1959,” ,Research
Report says.

A management magazine
survey of 175 large industrial
firms found that the “one con-
tract issue” which companies
indicate they are determined

4 to fight out is “rnanagement’s

right to manage.”

“This slogan,” the Mine-Mill
publication points out, “uses
high-sounding words to con-
ceal other purposes” which
companies want to hide from
the public, such as “the right
to manage workers as they do

 the Mine-Mill Research Report‘

a piece of machinery or prop-
erty.” Nailing the companies’
true purposes, the Report says:
WHAT THEY WANT

“They ca_.n’t win public sup-
port by openly saying they
want the right to hire or fire
at will, to scuttle seniority, to
assign or reassign workers re-
gardless of classification, to
change work schedules as
they see fit, to undermine
wages by contracting work out,
to decide if and when workers
get vacations, to unilaterally
set work and incentive stand-

infamous ‘eight points’ ad,-:.;
vanced by the steel companies;-~‘
and similar proposals made by

Kennecott and others in -this-9 
industry, you’ll find that this

is’ what they’re really after.” 

Another purpose of the‘ 5
prominence given by the com- ‘ p
panies -to this “management 
rights” issue is to shift atten- E‘ L
tion away from the hank- 
ruptcy of their arguments on , .
inflation, the MINE-MILL RE- .
PORT declares. ‘ I , -‘ _,

MARCH —- The 54th Mine- -

Mill convention projected the
union’s 1959 bargaining de-
mands, representing a distilla-
l”’ tion of local union resolutions
as as well as recommendations of
,_the International E x e c u t i v e
board and the various bargain-
ing councils which met in San
F r an e i s c o in pre-convention
sessions. The proposals spelled
out a package of .gains rang-
ing from substantial wage in-
creases to a comprehensive job
security program. The Wage
and Contract committee report
adopted by the delegates
pointed out that while the
companies had recovered from
the effects of the recession
' “our members have not expe-
rienced a similar recovery.”
I “This,” the delegates said, “is
" the basic imbalance that we
will seek to adjust in this
- year’s bargaining.” The dele-
. gates also elected members of
-1 the National Wage Policy com-
mittee consisting of members
from the various bargaining
councils. ’

' 2 gaining notices went to all

Fagements. In Utah, a ‘united

other unions in the Kennecott
chain; Contract demands were
finalized in Anaconda at meet-
ings of the Anaconda Joint
Negotiating committee in Mon-
tana and the American Brass
council in the east. Bargaining
proposals were circularized
among A’S&R locals from
coast to coast. Negotiating de-
tails were discussed by the
Phelps Dodge Joint Negotiat-
- ing committee at a meeting in
Arizona. Another meeting of
New Jersey smelting and re-
fining locals set up prepara-
' tion for bargaining in that
_ area. ,
 MAY —— Bargaining opened
‘V’, all over the country, well in
s . advance of the June 30 expira-
tion dates of nearly all non-
ferrous metals industry con-
tracts. Talks were held with
5 “PD in El Paso, Tex., and
‘ . Douglas, Ariz. Joint Mine-Mill
. negotiations covering all west-
'- ern operations were scheduled
(with Kennecott as bargaining

mid-July when the Interna-
tional Executive board’s bar-'
gaining, coordinating commit-
tee spelled out a new package
of revised demands in an ef-
fort to steer negotiations away
from a deadlock. The Board
set the final two weeks in July
for concentrated attempts to
reach a settlement. A meeting
of the National ‘Wage Policy
committee was called for Aug.
4 to assess developments and
map future action.

AUGUST—As the NWPC
met in Denver Aug. 4 and 5
there was still no offer from
any company. On Aug. 6 the
International Executive board
issued a statement approving
the recommendation of the
NWPC to authorize strike ac-
tion by or before August 20 in
any or all‘ major sections of
the industry. First chain to go
down was Kennecott, on Aug.
10, in Utah, Nevada, Arizona
and New Mexico, as last-ditch
efforts by the union failed to
gain a settlement. Eleventh
hour meetings also being un-
successful with Magma and
San Manuel, those Arizona
properties were struck on Aug.
11. Likewise in the other
chains; more meetings, no re-
sults.

On Aug. 19, Anaconda was
struck in Montana and,Utah.
On Aug. 20, Phelps Dodge
properties went down in Ari-
zona, Texas and California.
By Aug. 21, all AS&R proper-
ties were out across the coun-
try from New Jersey and
Maryland to California and
Washington.

_ American Brass in Connecti-
cut and New York, and U. S.
Metals in New Jersey re-
mained in operation as both
bargaining groups received
permission to extend the dead-
line on the basis of negotiable
offers. Previous contract exten-
sions until Aug. 31 were inef-
fect at Bunker Hill and the

t-Larson Finds
Labor in Peril

1- EVERAL years ago a prominent business-
‘ man in one of our larger Rocky Mountain
gcities Was found to have engaged in a compli-
, ___ cated bit of financial shenanigans that siphoned
C C» off several thousand dollars from his customers
0 and creditors. The business-
" man eventually was tried,
 :convicted and sentenced to
  "the state pen. Recently,
after completing his term,
 this same businessman an-
- inounced that he was going
’ back into business and
would attempt to repay all
r the vmoney that he had
.  stolen from the many who
 g had trusted him.
i ’ Practically everyone and -
every -newspaper in the area
f i had something to say about this case. I never
 I heard or read one comment that disagreed with
.0 “  -the-idea that this man, having discharged his
 ;debt to society, was entitled to a chance to
 ...,._rehabilitate himself and to re-establish his
 1 name. Nobody suggested that, because of his
" prison record, he should be barred from going
, back into business.

 _What brings all this to mind is my recent
 reading of the so-called “Labor Management
 Reporting. and Disclosure Act” which passed
the House on Friday, August 14. If, instead
. -of a businessman, this person had been a labor
i union officer, then, under the provisions of this
, " bill, he would be barred from holding anyjob
'_ with a labor union, other than clerical or cus-
zlﬁtcdial, for a period of five years. This same
‘ ‘ban would apply for several other convictions,
. including those that frequently result from try-
 ring, to prevent a scab from crossing at picket

,_line. . _ V _
 ' THIS kind of special standard for labor lead-
' -  ers——the notion that they’re a unique brand
‘igbf immoral creature requiring special criminal
 laws—_is the basic approach behind all of these
-«J-.‘labor reform” bills. ,

 Any lawyer is far better equipped than I to
do a thorough analysis of this long and com-
__*plicated bill. Just a casual reading of the text
, rieonvinces me that this is the most drastic bit
*7, of anti-lab‘or legislation to have emerged from
;ﬁther house of Congress in many a year, pos-
rsibly even more drastic than the Taft-Hartley

‘Act.

='jf.the ‘bill as the ban on secondary boycotts, “hot
“cargo” I clauses, organizational picketing, ex-
tortionate picketing and the like. All of these
provisions are very bad, but still don’t mean
1 Very much to the man in the street. The pro-
’visi"ons.on disclosure of financial information
9 a id reporting requirements are also obnoxious,
,,,’but' these, too,- in my mind, are not the worst
7? features of the bill.
‘HAT most concerns me is the effect of a
. . bill like this on the normal functioning
of the average local union-—the possibilities it
affordsfor slow strangulation of union life in
, web of red tape and regulatory procedures.
The average local secretary, in most locals in
If union, is a worker who at the end of his
regular shift, spends his spare time on union
business. Now, if this bill becomes law, he
becomes literally overwhelmed with ._ new and
v.exing_chores.' ,He will have to file -detailed
or”I'ns,and financial reports with the Secretary
, -Labor‘ in Washington, to inform all members
f‘,_the,lcrontents. of the bill, and to open all books,
coI"d.S.»‘: and accounts to any member (includ-
gg-.,stoolpigeons. and company agents) who
ks;-to lookat them. It won’t be sufficient, un-
r.;th,i_‘s_ bill, to have the books checked and
ted, by democratically elected trustees.
he. secretary must also “forward” to any
ember;fVvho requests it, a copy of the bargain-
g*:agreeinen,t; he can’t just say “come down
‘d-«‘-lpok. at-.it” or ‘get one from the company.”
of, these, as well as other requirements, if
met, can be penalized by up to $10,000 fine
‘ne"year in jail or both. ,
ge bill also affords a field day to company
_ pnts, provocateurs, disrupters and faction-
alists—-all of whom are guaranteed the right
.,to carry on at union meetings, with the addi-
.=’-gtional right to sue in Federal court for the “in-
fringement” of such rights. .
 pne column couldn’t begin to detail what’s
11 store for us if this bill becomes law. One of
history's-. supreme ironies is that it remained
pr“»a"Democratic-controlled House, elected with
abee: support, to pass this bill. Most of the
ng:;ress_men,who voted for it, I'm convinced,
‘ti even read the bill-—-they were swayed by
‘and-pressure.i All of this will require some
 re-thi’nking_ Qn our future political ac-

BOUT two months after our union, then”
the Western Federation of Miners, was‘
founded in 1893, President Grover Cleveland
called a special session of Congress to consider
the serious financial crisis threatening the
country at the time. It '
was that Congress which
adopted a bill designating
the first Monday in Septem-
ber as Labor Day, a‘ “public
tribute to the genius of
American industry.”
Sixty-five years later, an-
. other Congress meeting in
August also “honored”
labor. This time the Con-
gressmen paid no “public A
tribute” to labor. They had . ~
another purpose. In August of 1959, ilabor?s .
historic contribution toward the emergence of,“-,‘-.;

cidedly anti-union legislation in many years

is necessary. The fight is over how far they ;—

I And this leads me to the main theme of this,‘

column, my first since‘ being released A from’

and Negro rights are woven together.‘ -Who 
harms the Negro, it is establishednow, harms ' _,i"‘i
also the trade unionist. Many, many trade uri-" 5‘
ionists have not learned this lesson and it may-.
be a long time before they will. Nevertheless, ; _
it should be apparent to them now that among

 

 

the -white supremacists and the bigots.’ ‘’ They 

. hate labor as they hate the Negro, as they hated

any American who stands .;:»up for his rights
under the law, under the Constitution.

There is a perfect example of this joint"in- 
terest of Negroes and’ labor in the Landrum-'  
Griffin controversy. The bill eleminates a so-
called “no man’s land” around secondary boy-_ _
cotts. In the’ name of “state’s rights,” the
jurisdiction on this point has been broadened 
toinclude state -courts. If “state’s rights” are! 
applied to labor as they have been’ to the . 
Negro, then every trade union will indeed, suf-\_.n

9 Cut by M'C|eI|an .

WASHINGTON, D. C.——“Racketeering”
charges sensationalized by the McClellan com-
mittee with the help of the nation’s press
clearly had a direct bearing on union repre-

 sentation election results as summarized by

the National Labor Relations board in a recent
report covering the three-month period of April
through June, 1959. / . _ 1

J’ The statistics released by the Board show
that AFL-CIO unions suffered more by the
anti-labor propaganda resulting from the
“racket” hearings than did unaffiliated, or
independent, unions in the total of 1,651 elec-
"tions conducted by the NLRB during the three

month period.

INDEPENDENTS -
An interesting note revealed by the Labor

9 board statistics is the fact that independent

unions won more elections than AFL-CIO

v unions when both were on the ballot in di-

rect contests with each other. Of 148 such
elections, 70 were won by independent unions

‘ l as against 67 victories for AFL-CIO’affiliated

organizations.

._lEven where an AFL-CIO union had no
opposition on the ballot, there were 417 out

. of 957 elections in which the workers voted

.¢}"'

for no ‘union in preference to the AFL-CIO.
In other words, no union beat the AFL-CIO

‘-?about 45 per cent of the time. There were

actually more workers involved in the elec-
tions resulting in no union votes than there
were in those won by the unopposed AFL-CIO

AMERICAN SMELTING AND REFINING has just about
severed its major operating connections with KENNECOTT.
Last year AS&R sold its Garfield, Utah, copper smelter to Ken-
necott, and with completion of Kennecott’s Hayden, Arizona
smelter, the AS&R smelter there ceased treatment of Kennecott’s
Ray mine ores. At the AS&R refinery in Baltimore, Kennecott

will be able to call on less than half the total capacity beginning ,

next July 1. AS&R figures it will make more money under
the new setup. In its last annual report the company said it
will reinvest the proceeds of the sale of the Garfield smelter to
produce a higher rate of return. The Hayden smelter is fully
replacing its Kennecott business with ores from new Arizona
mines and making more from its treatment charges now than
it-did from Kennecott ores. At Baltimore, major emphasis in
the future will be on reﬁning blister from AS&R’s 57% per cent
owned Southern Peru Copper company, which will be coming
into production next year.

AMERICAN SMELTING AND REFINING will go ahead
with investment of $43,500,000 in development of Mission Proj-
ect copper mine and mill 15 miles southwest of Tucson, Ari-
zona. Decision to go ahead was preceded by five years of dia-
mond drilling and sinking of a test shaft. Mine will be open
pit and should be in production in about three years. Yearly

- production will be about 45,000 tons of copper—enough to place

it among the top 15 U. S. coppergmines. Ores will be smelted at
company's Hayden, Arizona, and El Paso, Texas, smelters.

-TARIFF COMMISSION announcesstart of new investiga-
tion of trend of imports of lead .and zinc products not subject
to quota restrictions. Since quotas were imposed last October
1 on imports of ores, concentrates, slab and pig, U. S. mining
and smelting firms have charged that quotas " were being by-
passed by imports of “manufactured” lead and zinc products
not subject to quota. Included, it is charged, are lead cannon
balls, lead and zinc sheet seconds which are melted down after
importation, and zinc die cast alloys not subject to quota.
Meanwhile, Congress is considering resolution to require Tariff
commission to submit a report “as to what additional import
restrictions, if any (by Way of increased duties or import quo-
tas or both) need to be imposed” on unmanufactured leadand
zinc, zinc dust, zinc alloys, and lead and zinc mill products, “in
order that lead and zinc mining operations in the United States

may be conducted on a sound and stable basis.” -

ators from the industry's position of J_uly.14_

hint from the industry of a “modest” wag
offer, never specifically made, was tied-tocon
ditions -for scuttling long-standing union‘ con
tract protections. Secretary Mitchell’s-~-much-c,‘
publicized “fact-finding” report issued on»-A-ug

no closer to a change of position. ' ‘ ~ 

Asked whether some outside fact-finding
committee might aid in settling the_ strike, "
Cooper answered that both sides in negotiations .
know the facts and “we don’t needxanyone else
to tell us the facts.” Chief Federal ,Mediat'o_
Joseph F. Finnegan said he saw nothing in th
picture to indicate an early settlement. Negotia-<.?
tions were continuing on non-economic contra‘c
language. The AFL-CIO Executive council, lay

Labor Bill  

(Continued from Front Page)
Rayburn, middle of the road
Congressmen in the HOUSE
wilted. The newspapers and
the big corporations convinced
many Congressmen that they
were in mortal danger unless
they voted for the Landrum-
Griffin bill. Enough pressures
were created to pass the bill
by 228 to 201.

The pressures on Congress '

men were so intense that on
final passage of the Landrum-
Griffin bill all lines cracked
and the final vote for passage
was 303 to 125.

IN ‘CONFERENCE

The House-passed bill must-
now go to conference to ad-
just the differences with the
Senate’s Kennedy bill. It ap-
pears that there will be little
hope of the Senate conferees
standing firm or that the
House conferees will yield so
that the Landrum-Griffin bill
will be eliminated. Probably
a patched-up version of both
bills will be submitted to both
Houses and accepted.

The Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers Union has never been
accused of racketeering, nor
do racketeering or undemo-
cratic practices exist in the
union.

But the Landrum‘- Griffin
bill is a severe measure. The
Labor movement has with-

stood many trials, but we can- t

not shut our eyes to the fact
that there are serious ques-
tions whether Mine-Mill or any

other union can expand, grow,‘

and give adequate protection
to its membership under this
law. Penalties are serious and
no distinction is made between
inadvertant slip-up and planned

fraud. The‘ basic tenet of in-

ter-union cooperation is seri-
ously endangered by the com-
plete ban on so-called second-
ary boycotts,’ while company
recognition of company unions
is made easier by the ban on
organizational picketing. An

‘anti-union Secretary of Labor,

with the immense power given
him under this bill, could cre-

ate endless harassment andt

legal entanglements for any
union.

’ ‘ ONE STEP FURTHER

The‘ Landrum-Griffin bill
takes the Taft-Hartley act one
step further. Government in-
terference and company har-
assment in the inner life of
trade unions will reach a new
high. The hysteria surround-
ing the passage of the Land-

‘rum-Griffin bill will also have

its affect on the copper and

steel strikes. This bill in com-
pany circles is being greeted
as an anti-labor victory and

‘ - , no doubt will stiffen the backs

of the steel and copper com-
panies against easy settlement.
But 1960 will be a new year.

- ' Labor in its own defense, will
, be forced to take a new look

at the political situation. Com-

‘- plete unity among all organ-

ized labor is obviously a must.
Never again can the anti-labor

._drives in Congress’ be consid-

ered merely the handiwork of
a few individuals or “crack-
pots.” Political and legislative
action no longer can be apart-
time jobs by the trade unions
of‘ .America. —— HERMAN

(Continued from Front Page)

badly shattered by the divisive
tactics of this leadership and
its “holier than thou” attitude,
its “code of ethics," which
have opened the way for the
most repressive legislation en-
acted against the labor move-
ment in its entire history. I
will be quite interested in read-
ing or hearing the Labor Day
speeches by s ome of these

-leaders.

HEAD HIGH

We can be sure though that
the worker, the dues-paying
member, is going to look back
to ‘his accomplishments and,
with his head held high, will
continue the fight for free la-
bor and for a better life for
his family. ,

This Labor Day may‘ well
see this union locked in a cru-
cial struggle with the mining
monopolists. This is a situa-
tion built by the metal com-
panies and their aspirations
for a world monopoly of'non-
ferrous metals, built to put the
low-wage countries in metal
production -against the Ameri-
can worker and his higher
standard of living.

We have. met the challenge
of some of these companies
with a determination to wrest
some of their abnormal profits
for further gains. for our mem-
bers. As this is written, we are,
in our democratic way, still
trying to settle with other

companies -without resorting -~ - . _ _
became. effective, copper ml-

to strikes which, - although-
sometimes a necessity, areno
satisfactory ‘way to settle
these disputes. We have been
through these struggles before
and the members of -this uni-.
ion don’t intend that this one
is going to be over with us on
the losing side. _

Let us hope that as other
Labor Days come around that
the recent attacks against or-
ganized American labor will be
washed out, Labor is strong
and has the political power, if
concentrated, to legislate for
labor back to the Wagner Act
days. We should always be
mindful of what Lincoln said:
He who says he loves Amer-
ica and hates labor is a liar.
There, is no America without
labor. Labor is America.

erage of all American indus-

“The copper companies also
have bolstered their already
substantial reserves through
special tax advantages and con-
cessions enjoyed by no other
industry.

WORKERS PAY

“Every piece of evidence, ev-
ery figure supports the charge
of the striking copper work-
ers that they have been made
to pay for the recession which

. _earlier had struck the indus-

try. But even this remarkable
-recovery at the expense of
their employees has not satis-
fied the greed of thecopper
corporations. Now they pro-
pose, by their refusal to bar-
gain, that the copper workers
shall not even begin to recov-
er what they have lost. The
employers’ no-offer position
proposes that they shall fur-
ther reduce their labor costs
at the expense of our mem-
bers. They propose that the
workers shall be given an even
smaller share in the prosperity
which they produced.

“Before our ‘ 1956 contracts

ners earned over a million dol-
lars more in wages than they
did in the first six months of
this year. This was despite the
wage gains that went into ef-
fect in July of 1956, 1957, and
1958. Yet -American miners
took more copper out of the
earth in the first six months
of 1959 than in the first half

of 1956. The trend toward an V

ever-decreasing share for la-
bor is what the companies are
seeking to perpetuate by their
uncompromising no-offer posi-
tion. The same trend is pres-
ent in the smelting and refin-
ing divisions.

With -this position the union
agreed, as it always has.

REVERSAL

“This year is anotherstory.
now the lofty sentiments of
rugged individualism and inde-
pendence are forgotten. Now,
the copper -companies, say,
‘let’s wait for steel; there’s no
hurry; what's your 1 rush?’
When profits are as high as
they are in copper, there is ob-
viously no rush—for the em-
ployers. But the workers could
not afford tolwait. Their spe-
cial needs and problems could

not be met by a steel settle- w

ment.

“When it became apparent
that the union’s members were
determined to recover what
they had lost, some of the em-
ployers resorted to classic di-
vide-and-conquer tactics. Ken-
necott, for example, tried to
drive a wedge between its em-
ployees in Mine-Mill and its
employees in the United Steel-
Workers. But the unity of the
workers in the copper indus-
try has remained fast. The
splitting attempts have failed.

“Mine-Mill did not strike
frivolously. Our members are
reasonable men and have been
willing from the start to com-
promise and bargain, in the
best American tradition.

“But our members need ac-
tion. With the companies rest-
ing comfortably on their rec-
ord profits, the workers’ eco-
nomic situation has deterio-
rated rapidly. No recourse was
left except to strike. -
SIMPLE ISSUE

“There will be a settlement
with the struck companies.
But it will take, the combined
efforts of every Mine-Mill
member to win that settle-
ment. When the facts of com-
pany arrogance are known by
every ‘community, the strikers

. will be immeasurably strength-

ened. The issue is very simple:

“It’s whether the workers in

the copper industry are en-
titled to protect themselves
from the ravages of speedup,
higher productivity, and in-
creased living costs, while in-
dustry profits keep soaring at
their expense. That’s what the
strike is about and that is the
issue that must be -settled be-
