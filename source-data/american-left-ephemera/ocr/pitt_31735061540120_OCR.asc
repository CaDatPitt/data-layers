If it chance your eye offend you,
Pluck it out, lad, and be sound

’Twill hurt, but here are salves to friend you,
And many a balsam grows on ground

And if your hand or foot offend you,
Cut it off, lad, and be whole;

But lay the man stand up and end you,
Vihen your sickness is your soul.

Lovliest of trees, the -cherry now

Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide

Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,

And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.

And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty s rings are little room,
About t e woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.

Come, friends, come, push back with me the darkness’ veil,
come pull apart with me this cloak to light,

come pull apart with me the cloak of sorrow

and let us sing again the songs of joy,

the songs he sung we'll sing together.

This man’s task for us remains unfinished
but ours for him is just begun;

this man’s s irit breathes forever

his passion ives, his hope remains,

we will not let him die,

AN APPRECIATION BY STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN
APRIL 24TH, 1960

“Now one of the principal blessings of virtue is the contempt of
dealth, by means of which our life is furnished with a sort of tran-
ui 1 

q "Tyhere is no evil in life for him who has rightly understood that
privation of life is no evil. Your death is of one piece with the order
of the universe, it is of one piece with the life of the world. Death is
the condition of your creation, it is a part of you. Life is itself nei-
ther a_ good not an evil, it is the scene of good and evil, as you ar-

range it.”
(Michael de Montaigne)

This wisdom Hugh Hardyman understood. "As you arrange it.”
His affection for the words of Ecclesiastes, for Laotse, for Montaigne
stemmed from their shared conviction that life is neither good not evil
but the scene where good and evil embrace one another in struggle...
as we arrange it. None of these men of the classic past was a fata-
list; they were all realists who insisted that man play his role with
rationality and courage, turning neither to the gods nor to the human
voices of despair.

Of all the religions in history Mr. Hardyman found, especially in
later years, that Taoism came closest to reality and prophesied most
amazin ly the needs of man in a natural world where humanistic and
sgientiﬁc values would release the most of value for the earth's peo-

es.
P The insight, the irony, the social passion, the belief in the peoples’
welfare, the confidence in man’s owers to use nature for his own good
...all of this Hugh read in Iloseplf Needham’s Science and Civilization
in China with its scholar y quotations in extensos from the ancient
manuscripts of Taoism.

Modern China of Mao Tse Tung and ancient China of the Taoist
philosophers and social scientists captured Hugh's mind and heart.
He wanted to return to China, and to be buried there. I read but a few
words from Needham’s quotations from Tao Cbia:

“So long as the royal court is in order,

rulers are content to let the fields run to weeds

and the granaries stand em ty.

They wear patterns and emhroideries,

Carry sharp swords, glut themselves with drink and food,

[11]

  

Have more ossessions than they can use-
These are t e riotous ways of brigandage,
they are not the Tao.” ,

And from Tao Te Qhing; (The Hou Wai-Lu interpretation) we read the

ancient Toaist criticism of the feudal system, about 300 B.C., the
time of Aristotle, Epicurus and Zeno,

“Thirty spokes combine to make a wheel.‘

When there was no private pro erty cartswere made for use.
Clay is formed to make vesse s;

When there was no private property, vessels were made for use.
Windows and doors go to make a house;

When there was no private pro erty, houses were made for use.
Thus having private property eads to profit for the feudal lords,

But not having it leads to use for the people.”

One of Hugh’s favorite figures of the twentieth century was the
amazing and erudite, humane and brilliant Rabindranath Tagore of
India. Hugh had heard him speak and had read his writings for many

years. I conclude our service with these words of Tagore’s:

"I have got in leave. Bid me farewell, my brothers! I bow to you all
and take my eparture.

Here I give back the keys of my door--I give up all my claims to my
house. I only ask for last kind words from you.

We were neighbors for long, but I received more than I could give.
Now the day has dawned and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out.
A summons has come and I am ready for my journey."

VERSES
WRITTEN
BY
HUGH HARDYMAN

E13]

 

BITTER ALOES

 

No, these are not the retty verses
That make you smi e;

They are the thoughts distilled from curses
Written in bile.

There was a time for snow-white mallows
And gentle song;
 Now is a time for bitter aloes
 To purge our wrong.

MOTHER'S DAY, 1950 '

What mothers want is always much the same; .
A man around the house or comin home,

The children healthy, hungry, ma in noise,
Food in the cupboard, clothes and s oes enough,
A yard with flowers and a school where kids
Can learn more than their parents ever knew.
This is what mothers want in our town

And in New York and Moscow and Belgrade.

All mothers everywhere want these same things
But most of us don't get them and the few

Who have them are afraid of losing them.

The world has wheat and wood and iron and oil
And coal and wool enou h for eve one

And yet in Fresno and ormosa ki s

Are going hungry. _In the state of Maine
Potatoes are piled up and s rayed with dye

To keep the price too high or those who need
To bu them. And in Kansas, where we have
A mil ion pounds of butter in a cave,

The children of the migrants eat dry bread

And not enough of that, althou h the bins

And elevators overflow with w eat

And everywhere, in London, Leningrad,

In Paris, Brussels, Rome and Singapore,

f The selfsame question underlies our dreams

E And naws in waking hours at our hearts:
 “Willg they grow u or will another war

Starve, burn and last the children of the world?”

Only five years ago the Golden Gate

Heard the words spoken which held all our hopes:
“One world! United Nations on the march

With flags unfurled!” Freedom from want and fear
Would follow victo and all mankind

Would turn from kil ing to the nobler task

Of building brotherhood in every land.

The war was almost over. It had cost

The lives of twenty million and the waste

Of treasure was enou h to build a house

For every family in a I the world

And build a hospital in ever town

And-run the hospitals for a ecade

[14J

 

It was enough. _ The people cried for peace

In every continent, for peace, for peace.

The words of Roosevelt circled round the globe
And hearts of mothers echoed: "Freedom! Peace!”

We stand betrayed! The men who hated him
Have torn aplart the structure that he built,
Have s lit t e world in two, declared cold war
Instea of peace and boasted to the world

Of greater and more monstrous means of death.
Fear fills the land; men are afraid to write,
To speak, to think, to dare to pray for peace,
Lest hunger kill their children while they rot
In prison. Gentle men from other shores,

Who come to beg for peace and for one world,
Are denied entry lest their words arouse
Memories of Roosevelt in each mother's heart,
Kindle anew the failing fire of hope,

Awake in men the courage to Resist,

To stop the madness of Los Alamos,

To save from their own folly those rich fools
Who seek to keep their power at the cost

Of blowing up themselves and half the world.

It is enough. Listen, Curie! Picasso!

The mothers of America have heard

Your message. We are with you! We want peace!
We want to stop building atomic bombs.

We want to send the Chinese people ploughs
And penicillin, cotton, atabrine,

Not rifles and machine-guns. We want eace!
We want to help the Russian people build

A better world. _ We want to try to mend,

The cities that the Nazis smashed in Poland.
We want to use our giant factories

To give to every mother in the world

Food in the cupboard, clothes and shoes enough,
A yard with flowers and a school where kids
Can learn more than their parents ever knew.

We want your children and ours to grow up,

To live in peace, in peace, in peace, in peace!

The tide is out, the rocks are bare and dead,
A gray and sullen sky hangs overhead.

In Washington the rich are planning war
And how to screw more taxes from the poor.

As surely as the sunlit waves will churn
The beach again and the high tide return,

The truth will revive the people drugged with lies.
They will stand up with anger in their eyes.

[15]

 

Free Choice

How can the young men learn that they are free?

From school and college, Congress, pulpit, press

Comes not a hint from which a youth could guess
That he has still a choice of whatito be.

All voices tell him he is but a cog

In the inflexible machine -which grinds

Korean cities, people, bodies, minds

To ashes, as a pulp-mill grinds a log.

To be a killer is his destiny,

All cry in chorus. And the lad whose soul
Revolts against all killing, does not know

It is not true—that he can still say ‘No’,

Refuse to make a murderer’s life his goal

...‘_.,.__.f._-- _ 4...._-*_._...- ..._...

And, choosing prison, hecan still be free.

From Shanghai, 1952

"-we had seen models of the Haui river project, the locks, sluice-
gates, canals; written down copious notes on floods for eight centuries
—since 1194, to be exact when the Yellow River flooded down and
and silted up the mouth of the Huai river, which has flooded ever
since. Except for last year when the basic work was done.”

HUAI RIVER PROJECT

I.

The earth is brown, the men are dressed in blue.
The ditch is a full hundred metres wide Q
But blue obscures the brown on either side _

And almost hides the muddy ground from view. l
For half a mile the blue in constant motion ;
Fills the high heaven with strange, chanted sounds, I
A joyous, vital roar that almost drowns

The music broadcast over the blue ocean.

Bright spots of red are scattered through the blue,
Each banner marking one team’s own terrain,
The lines beneath it moving without strain

And without pause from dawn to fall of dew,
Carrying earth in‘ baskets up the slope,

Building a dam and a new life of hope.

[16]

II

In ordered pattern sixty thousand men

Are walking up and down the muddy side
Of a great ditch. The freedom and the pride
Of huge achievement make each group of ten
Or twenty strive in friendly emulation

To carry more earth further than the rest.
Each man is -trying to outdo his best,

Well knowing he is "building a new nation.

To tame the river that has wrecked the life

Of countless millions through eight centuries
Is a clear symbol of the victories

To come, when poverty, disease and strife
Are conquered by a people who have cast
Off their old chains and know their power at last.

Liberation

This is the way that things will be
VVhen the Americans are free.

The race track has become a park
Where children play from dawn to dark
And in the evening workers dance
While colored lanterns shed romance.

The young have learned that happiness"
Means giving more and takin less;

In music, painting, danc' , p ays,
They vie to win the genera praise.

Some in the laboratories ﬁnd

The great adventures of the mind,
While others of a pastoral bent

In field and forest choose content.

They speak with wonder of the crime
Committed in the former time,

When man ignored his brother’s need
And laws upheld the rule of greed.

How strange that men who found the ways
To free the atom.’s splendid rays,

Once made their biggest industry
Destruction of humanity!

Atomic power serves us now

To drive the train, the plane, the plough,
To furnish water from the seas

To cover desert plains with trees.

[17]

 

The people, black and white and brown,
Together build our garden town,

Large houses for large families,

For chﬂdless couples, cottages.

No smoke deﬁles the changing skies
Where our triumphant towers rise.
Some empty hospitals remain,
Grim relics of the age of pain.

All households share in keeping clean

 

Our sidewalks, roads and parkways green.

Picnicking parties guard with ride
The beauty of their countrysidle.

All work together to produce
The things we need for daily use,
Each offering his chosen skill
To make the good life better still.

This is the way that things will be
When the Americans are free.

TO THE N E0-MALTHUSIANS

Their propaganda failin ,
Their power ebbing fastg,

As peo le after people

Cast 0 f their chains at last.

The evil men of money

. Are cryin in despair:
“Your mu tipl ing children
Will eat the planet bare.”

O evil men of money,

If what you say is true,

Cheer up! Our children s children
Will die long after you.

[18]

WHERE ARE WE GOING?

W/iere are we going, fellow citizens?

To what inhuman and revolting end

Is this sleep-walking nation being led?

Shall free Americans accept the yoke

Of brutal plutocratic tyranny

Before the wooden crosses rot that mark

The graves of those who died to lift that yoke
From European necks? The stench of death
Still lingers round the walls of Buchenwald;
The piles of teeth, the mounds of children’s shoes
Are there for every Congressman to see,

Who cares to’ ﬂy to Europe. Rotterdam,
Lidice, Warsaw mark the path of those

Who sought by force to subjugate the world
For exploitation by a master race.

Where are we going, fellow citizens?

The ashes of Sinuiju and Wonsan

Shall not grow cold in silence while one voice
Conservative enough to cry: “For shame!”
Can still be raised. “For shame! For shame! For

shame!” r _

The massacre of helpless residents

Of cities undefended from the air

Is criminal in Asia as in Europe.

People who never hurt Americans,

Who never threatened to attack our coasts,
Who had no warships, built no bombing planes,
Who fought us only when we sent our men
Across an ocean to attack their men

In their own cities, towns and villages,

These people we are killing with our bombs,
Roasting‘ alive with jellied gasoline.

W here are we going, fellow citizens?

The powers hardly won at Valley Forge,
Saved for’ the people in the Bill of Rights
And ratiﬁed in blood at Gettysburg,

Are being taken from us while we sleep.
The Representatives of Southern States,
Where rights of Negro voters are abridged,
Loll in the Congress. Men who exercise

Hugh Maitland Hardyman was born in Bath, England, of Scottish
parents in 1902. He came to the United States in 1920, became a
citizen in 1927. He worked on news apers, contributed to liberal
publications, wrote on foreign affairs fldr thirty years, while working
at fruit growing and other business enter rises. In 1944 he retired
from ranching and with his wife, Susan Is am Hardyman, founded the
Ormsby Hill Trust which rovides vacations in Manchester, Vermont,
for under rivileged boys rom city areas. He continued in his activ-
ities in the struggle for civil liberties and peace in Southern Califor-
nia. In 1952 he was a dele ate from the United States to the Peace
Conference of the Asian an Pacific Regions in Peking. In 1954 he
moved to Mexico and made his home in Huejotitan, Jalisco, sharing it
with twenty homeless Mexican boys, teaching them agriculture while
enabling them to finish their schooling. He was active in this work
until his death, April 5, 1960, in Guadalajara.

 

The Christianity of William Penn

Are thrown in prison. Writers, who refused
To offer their opinions and beliefs

For censorship, are silenced in our jails.
Peaceful assemblies broken up by mobs
Evoke no action from a Governor

Who buys and sells the ofﬁces of state.

Our honored statute books are now defaced
With Public Law 831, which makes
Provision here for concentration camps.

Where are we going, fellow‘ citizens?

The promise of ‘the last best hope of earth’
Can be redeemed if we but speak the word.
The means areeours to build a joyous land
Of healthy bodies and unshackled minds,
To wipe out gonorrhea and syphilis,
Tuberculosis and malaria,

To use our steel in China and Korea

For building bridges, not destroying them,
Promote the general welfare of all men

Here and in Europe, Asia, Africa,

By free exchange of knowledge and- of goods
With all who need them, leaving others free
To run their countries better if they can.

Where are we going, fellow citizens?

The ashes of Sinuiju and Wonsan

Demand an answer. Do we leave our past,
Which had much brightness, and assume the role
Of Genghis Khan, of Adolf Schickelgruber?
Send our young men to kill and to be killed

In any land whose people will not pay

Tribute to Chiang Kai-Shek or Standard Oil?
Do we abandon freedom to become
Mechanized stomachs gorging on mankind?
Do we‘ accept political police, ’
Informers, perjurers, censors, all the spawn
Of Fascist tyranny because of fear

That other people, far less fortunate

Than we, may build themselves with their bare

hands

. Cities and power plants and factories

Designed for their own use and not for gain
Of kings, of prelates or ofmillionaires?

Where are we going, fellow citizens?

Have we achieved the marvels of Oak Ridge,
Of Hanford, of Los Alamos, where men
Have scaled the ﬂaming ramparts of the sun,
Bringing back tools to recreate the world,

To probe the mystery of the universe,

To learn the hidden processes of life,

Only to use this triumph of the mind

To build machines to devastate and kill,

To waste the substance of the centuries,

To murder millions with a single bomb?
And should the power to use this monstrous bomb
Be placed by a free people in the hands,

Not of our sages, scientists and seers,

Not of our Senators and Congressmen,

But of a single man, however wise,

Learned and prudent such a man may be. .

Where are we going, fellow citizens?

The question must be answered. It is we

Who are responsible. We have the power.

The guilt for those who perish in Korea

Is shared by all of us, all, all but those

In the unvisited and loathsome zoos

Where men whom we have wronged are caged and

starved,

Beaten with clubs and‘ whips and rubber hose,
Chained in dark holes and tortured by our guards.
We are responsible who know the truth

And are not yet in prison. We can speak
Loudly enough to waken from their sleep

The apathetic and the ignorant;

Can put an end to bombing and to war,

Bring back our troops from other people’s lands,
Demand disarmament for all the world,

Destroy our stockpile of atomic bombs,

Rebuild the ruined cities of Korea,

Turn from our Fascist follies and advance

Into the sunlight, walking without fear

In peace and freedom, worthy of our past.

AN APPRECIATION or HUGH HARDYMAN BY REUBEN W. BOROUGH
APRIL 24111, 1960

For nearly forty years Hugh Hardyman was my friend. With minor
and stimulating differences, we shared each other’s hopes and con-
victions. We worked together in political, social and cultural causes.
It was upon Hugh Hardyman’s insistence that I joined the First Unita-
rian Church, in whose auditorium we are here assembled.

I knew him well. In the heat of crusades, in the simple, heart-
warmin and-at a time of reat loss in my own life—heart healin
hospita ity of his and Sue's ome in La Crescenta, I felt the stir, an
sometimes the sting, of his challenging audacity, his insatiable
curiosity, and his dee -rooted loyalties. In that La Crescenta home,
as well as in my own ome in Los Angeles, we examined and debated
without apolo y and without quarter the revolutionary issues of our
time. Hugh, t e joyous and unreserved controversialist, laid himself
wide o en! AND THERE WAS NO DROSS IN HIM-THE GOLD WAS
RICH ND PURE!

I have not personally known another individual who, out of a life
of incessant search and struggle, finally achieved such clarity and
firmness of moral and social purpose.

I first met Hugh back in the earl 1920's as a reporter on the Los
Angeles ‘Record, a Scripps—Howar newspaper which folded in the
l930’s. Coming to America from his home in England, he had hitch-
hiked his way across the United States to meet the world-famous
socialist, Upton Sinclair. On The Record, the shy but articulate cub,
around twenty years of age, soon became indispensable company. to
the working staff-the "gang”—at lunch. time and at other informal
gatherings. It was not only the stamp of his English background
which fascinated us and endeared him to us; it was his provocative
but friendly humor with its abrupt way of upsetting intellectual apple-
carts.

Hugh became part of a close circle of Sinclair's friends and civil
liberties supporters.‘ He was one of the three who with Upton was
arrested on Liberty Hill, San Pedro, for holding a police-banned meet-
ing in May, 1923, in defense of free speech for the Industrial Workers
of the World. Sinclair was taken into custody bya Blue Coat while he
was reading the first-the “free speech”—-amendment to the United
States Constitution; Hugh, after he had glanced amiably u at the
brightly shinin stars and had commended California’s “ eautiful
weather.’f Hugﬁ, with Sinclair and the two other defendants, Hunter
Kimbrough and Pryns Hopkins, were later released from the ludicrous
charges of "contributing to riot,” etc.

Back in New York City in the middle 1920's after a visit to his
home in England, Hugh, though beset with the indecisions of youth,
was obviously reaching out for his particular role on the social scene.
In a letter to a friend this very young man said in the true Hardyman
style that all of us who knew him loved;

"It seems that I am growin up, that the boy who once worked on

' The Record is nearly dead an in his place is found a curious char-

acter, described variously b different people as an impudent scoun-
drel, a care-free optimist, a c eerful pessimist, ahopeless misanthrope

E3]

  

a vagabond philosopher, a red radical, an ingrown soul, a harmless
lunatic...

"What I shall become by spring I do not know. (But) be in no wise
afraid. I am healthier and happier than at any time heretofore and
find more entertainment in the gigantic spectacle of which we all
form a art."

Fol owed soon the blessed union with Susan Isham, of an old New
England family of Manchester, Vermont, and the inspiration and hap-
piness of family life.

With it came the work with Susan for peace, for civil liberty and
civil rights for all, for social justice, for the under-privile ed children
of New York and Los Angeles-the whole inter-mingle with hotly
waged political campaigns for progressive candidates and progressive
causes. _ It is now an inseparable part of human history, ravely and
faithfully lived by Hugh and Susan Hardyman.

What was the concept that set, and kept, in motion this man, Hugh
Hardyman? For him the myths of orthodoxy were long banished and in
their place stood reason and the revelations of science. To Hugh the
primary importance of man and of man's progress-at least, to man-
was beyond dispute. Was this faith spurred by conviction of imminent
victory? As one who knew him for nearly four decades, I should say,

robably not. He did not need the bribe of immediate success to keep
him true to his faith. There was more than a grain of truth in the de-
fiant paradox which he delighted to fling at his friends: "I am solidly
grounded on the bedrock of despair.”

Ah, but that was before China! In 1953 Hugh Hardyman went to
the People's Republic andthe triumphant achievements of the bur-
geoning social revolution seized him and shook him to the core,
wrenchin him from doubts and reservations and half conclusions and
sending im forth in blazing illumination so that ever afterward he
would say: "I have seen it—it is here now!"

What Hugh had seen—and what he told us about most eloquently-
was the greatest social transformation in human history: 600 million
people in less than a decade liberated from thousands of "years of
tyranny and woe, from thousands of years of flood, famine and lague
and released into the mounting security and the joy and lau Eter of
communal life and love. _Who can forget his rhapsodic tales 0 friend-
ly children singing and dancing under silken banners?

The final step from China to Mexico and Mexico’ s des erately oor
and illiterate farmers was logical. Indeed, as we now ook bac , it
might_ almost ‘seem to have been inevitable: the climax of a restless,
magnificent life. * * * * * *

"In 1944 he retired from ranching and with his 2/e,
Susan Isham Hardyman founded the Ormsby Hill Trust which provi es
vacations in Manchester, Vermont /or underpriveleged boys from the
city areas. ”

"I am surprised and excited to learn that you have seen and visit-
ed my good friend Hugh Hardyman. In my book he is one of the great-
est men I have ever associated with personally. He is thousands of
years ahead of our times. I believe he has had a rear influence upon
me from being associated with him at Ormsby Hi 1, Vermont. If this
is not true, I wish it were. I like the way he thinks acts and is, and
I wish that I could do likewise. At Ormsby Hill I was introduced to a
thought world, an actual living world which was beautiful. I was in-
troduced to ideals and lived them, which our would-be do-gooders in
high positions pretend they are striving for. Hugh has had some bad

liberties and peace in Southern California. ”
AN APPRECIATION BY AL Wmm APRIL 24111, 1960

We are here to pay our respects to a great and good friend-to
Hugh Hardyman. He was a great and good friend of people-of little
people, articularly the underprivileged and the oppressed. That is
why he evoted his life to the well-being of children in Mexico, for a
friend of eople is the captive of no state or nation; and so he was
concerne with the welfare of many eople. This explains why he fell
in love with the people of China—6 0 million of them.

Perhaps the eepest tragedy of his death is that expectation that
he would revisit China-this time with Sue-will now never be realized.

And this loss of Sue’s will be shared with her by thousands in
China, with many to whom I spoke, who looked upon Hugh as a true
Ambassador from the people of the United States to the people of
China, an Ambassador of good will, a good and great friend of the
people of China. .

Hugh Hardyman was, additionally, a man of high spirit, of unbri-
dled independence, of unbounded courage.

When vigilantes invaded his home, to break up a peaceful meeting,
he stood his ground, unintimidated, unafraid. T e record of that epi-
sode may be found in the official reports of the Supreme Court of the
United States, for Hugh Hardyman sought vindication of his rights in
the highest court of the land. _F or he knew that by asserting his rights
he was defending the rights of every American.

Hu h Hardyman was not one to say in China to the Chinese people
that w ich pleased them, and to change his views in the United States
to please an official of the United States, whether Mr. Dulles, the
Justice Department, or Mr. Walter of the U. S. Con ress.

When I a peared with him before the House Un merican Committee
Iwas fearfu that his forthright views—unpalatable to that committee-
would result in Hugh's going to jail, but Hugh Hardyman was utterly
unafraid. He was fearless before the House Committee, as he was un-
intimidated by the Los Angeles police; and so, he was one of three
that violated a police order by the reading of the Declaration of Inde-

endence during a street meeting in San Pedro, an act of independence
in the 1920's that resulted in the founding of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California.

The freedom that we now have is ours because men have loved
freedom and have had the courage to exercise it. Hugh Hardyman was
such a man. All of us here are more free today because Hugh Hardy-
man lived.

Each of us has more courage, each walks down the street with
stout heart and head high because we knew Hugh Hardyman; each of
here has more dignity and humanity because we have shared with Suse
the dignity and humanity which filled Hugh Hardyman brimful and
over-flowing.

Our lives are the richer and the fuller because Hugh lived among
us.

ExcERPTs OF LETTERS FROM PEKING

“At the aifpggt we are feeted  dignitaries and some little girls.
A girl about ten in the ref scarf of the young pioneers gives me flow-
ers-she is incredibly beautiful, we hold hands, lau h together, change
neck-ties, the university student who interprets gr us is charming,
but the little child has stolen my heart away. I hate to leave her at
the airport after we have had tea. All the peo le are infinitel warm,
friendly, kind, courteous without formality. he ten miles tom the
airport to the city are familiar in just the same sense that Edinbur h
was familiar to me on my first visit. This is home. The beauty of t e
roofs, the cleanliness of the city, the air of well-being of the people
some of whom are certainly poor, the lorious summer weather, the
old stone. All the old tales of the won rous color of the tiles, of the
gates, of the roofs are true. The Forbidden City is the miracle of art
that it has been for so long. The people, frank, simple, free in their
movements, in their direct eyes. Poor, yes, of course, but human in

‘the way that all men may some time be-with dignity and grace.”

FROM ANOTHER LETTER

"—We took flowers to the Korean delegation and gave them a small
elm to plant in Korea as a symbol of life and the seed of Korean-
American friendship. It was a movin little ceremony and reduced men
in the conference to tears. The spo en words were few-: ‘We, of the
American people, who admire bravery and hate cruelty, ask that ou
will plant in the soil of Korea, soil made holy by the blood o an
heroic people, this small tree.

‘May it grow as the friendship of our eoples grow; ma it green
with the green leaves of life, nourished y sunlight and the rain of
heaven, until it shelters under its green boughs, in safety and beauty
and peace the children of your children.’ "

AN EXCERPT FROM A SPEECH BY H. H. FOR THE MASS MEETING IN PEKING

"Armed with your sword of joy, we return to our battles with the
hosts of war, carrying in our breasts new certaint of victory. We
know that the ferocious beasts of prey, who woulcf, have us believe
that they are all-powerful, are indeed but paper tigers who will melt
beneath the rain of wrath of the united and enlightened peo le. To
dispel the darkness of our people and to gather them toget er until
they speak with one mighty voice for peace, this is the task to which
we pledge our mind and heart and strength. Only as we fulfill this
task can we repay a small portion of the great debt we owe to you,
ghe most generous of hosts, the people of Peking. So now to work-

or Peace.”

EULOGY or HUGH HARDYMAN IN HUEJOTITAN, ]AL1sco, MEXICO
ZENON ARROYO MALDONADE

Hugh Hardyman lived in the United States most of his lifetime and
there left unmistakable evidence of his talents, a magnificent harvest
from his innermost bein . Those were the years of intellectual growth
and the acquisition of t e ideas which were to help him function with
such success in the harsh soil which he came to till in our Mexico.
Hugh belongs not only to the United States, but also to Mexico, since
his mind functioned on an international, rather than on a rovincial,
scale. It is not our intention to recall him on a regiona basis for
reasons of egotism, but rather to eulogize the Mexican feeling he had
when speaking of the economic roblems of the Mexican people. It
was not without lo ic that he s ould have founded a free boarding
school for boys in t e village of Huejotitan.

There is no need to speak of his birthplace. What is important is
to review briefly his life and to reconstruct his scale of values so as
to learn and put into practice those truths that were indelibly his.
And Huejotitan can be proud to have influenced his outlook.

It is only fitting to explain that while he was born in another coun-
try, jalisco constitutes an essential phase of his orbit, a beloved
collection of his affections and warm feelings, an obligatory point of
reference on the chart of his voyage. ,As a matter of fact, some of the
most important events of his life took place in this land of Jalisco.
Here he came into close Contact with the humble and here, in the
clear twili ht and morning chill, he came to know them.

The sc ool he founded is thus his true memorial. _ Being generous
and hos itable, he knew the worth of friendship and the value of serv-
in his ellow man. A calm and composed atmosphere allowed him to
ai where aid was needed. Those were the years of learning, of en-
larging the scope of his knowledge through study and observation.
Years passed eacefully as he atiently awaited the human harvest
resulting from is devotion to un erprivileged boys.

During his frequent trips to the United States, he kept in close
contact with Jalisco, always supervisin his school and the boys to
whom he was devoted. When I arrive at Huejotitan as a country
school teacher, I was immediately taken with Hugh, whose humanita-
rian work was progressin in the hamlet. In the boarding school, he
and his wife Suse worke side by side, lending great dignity to the
enterprise, changing the attitudes of the rural people. If we are to
identi them wit in this circle, Hu h was the commander-in-chief and
Suse t e first lady, but in the fina analysis, they both were leaders
of the eople and examples of dedication.

Be ore his death, Hugh made important statements confirming his
propensity for his school.

Let everyone, where he may be, in his own way, pay homage, so

lon as it be with respect and reverence. It is for us who lived close
to im to recollect his good work and in the future, to point out to
those who did not know him, the moderation of this reatman; he who
ministered to the poor and hel less living expose to the elements.
Jalisco loved him, flesh and b ood because he felt the sorrow of the
poor and the suffering of the lowly and appreciated as his very own
the human drama of this country that he loved.
A iant shadow covers the face of the Huejotitan boys’ school.
It is tlée form of Hugh rising gloriously over the years of liberty] and
the portrait of a hero. May those enerations passing throug the
school thrill at the life and death 0 this great North American. We
who knew him value him as a true Mexican.

HUGH

I never knew him in the trying days

That people speak of now when they would praise
His fortitude, and faith in man. Integrity

Was his, and so was ho e. No liberty

Was small to him-—No c ild that was not his

Walk on this earth and looked for peace.

I knew a man whose flowers were a joy

To him. Who oftentimes would take a younger boy

(For there were many children always near),

And teach him patiently the way to pare

A tree—or how to mow the deep green lawn

He loved, and spent his pleasure time upon.

I knew him only to be kind to me:

A man whose love was freedom—and whose heart was free.

THE AF FIRMATION OF LIFE

’Tis not too late to seek a ‘newer world.

Push off, and sitting well in order smite

The sounding furrows: for my pur ose holds

To sail beyond the sunset, and t e paths

Of all the western stars, until I die;

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,

And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Tho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho’

We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

To strive, to see, to find and not to yield.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson

"Man's dearest possession is life, and it ‘is given
to him to live but once. He must live so as to
feel no torturing regrets for years without purpose,
never know the burning shame of a mean and petty
past; so live that, dying, he "can say; all my life,
all mystren th were given to the finest cause in
all the worl -the fight for the Liberation of Man-
kind. _ And one must make use of every moment of
life, lest some sudden illness or tragic accident
cut it short.”

READINGS FROM ECCLESIASTES

I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
concerning all thin s that are done under heaven: this sore travail
hath God given to t e sons of man to be exercised therewith.

To every thing there is a season, and a time to every
purpose under heaven: _

A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and
a time to pluck up that which is planted;

A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn,
and a time to dance;

A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;

_ A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a
time to cast away;

Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than
that a man should rejoice in his own works, for that is his portion;

for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to
the swift, nor the battle to the wise, nor yet riches to men of under-
standing, not yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance hap-
peneth to them all.

For man also knoweth nothis time: as the fishes that
are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare
so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly
upon them.

This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it
seemed great unto me.

Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it
after many days.

Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou
knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.

Because man goeth to his long home.

And the mourners go about the streets:

Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken
at the cistern, then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and
the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

LAST POEMS
XXXII

When I would muse in boyhood
The wild green woods among,
And nurse receives and fancies
Because the world was young,
It was not foes to conquer,
Nor sweethearts to be kind,
But it was friends to die for
That I would seek and find.
