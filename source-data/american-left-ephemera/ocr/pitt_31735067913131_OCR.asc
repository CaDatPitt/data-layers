THE ALBANY HOTEL IS THE SITE OF THE 59TH MINE-MILL INTERNATIONAL CON-
VENTION. scheduled for the Week of August 16. Seen as one of the most important in
recent years, the convention will develop policy to guide the union in the coming two
years, Such subjectsas finances and strike funds, civil rights, political action, education
and publicity, and bargaining——discussion of which was initiated at the series of district
-conferences—will be pursued. Major speakers at the convention will include U. S. Senator
Lee Metcalf of Montana and the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, an important leader in the civil
rights struggle in the South. The hotel, at 17th and Stout Streets in the heart of downtown

Denver, Colorado, will provide parking facilities for the delegates staying there.

Uty and Determination of 1964
Again Pay Dividends This Year

A second installment of contract benefits, wrested
from the major non-ferrous metals chains last year by a
united Mine-Mill Union that hung tough in bargaining
and upon occasion went out onstrike, began being paid
by the companies on July 1. , -

On that date, wage gains throughout the industry
ranging from six to 12 cents per hour went into effect,

in addition to health and welfare improvements, increased

shift; differentials, and better vacation ‘and holiday
schedules at many of the major properties. These wage
hikes compare very favorably with those negotiated in
other industries in 1964 and so far this year, as do the
V gained over the entire three-year
contract_ period. A _ '

All of the major Mine-Mill agreements of last year

provide wage gains of at least 21 to 24 cents per hour. _

By the contract expiration date, in other words, the
worker will be making from $436.80 to $499.20 more per
year in wages alone, figured on the basis of a normal 40
hours per week without overtime. The American Zinc pact, which
contains less in fringe benefits than the others, provides 34 cents
per hour in wage increases over the three years, or $707.20 more
per year by its expiration date. ' I

' Here are the contract gains that took effect on the 1st of this
month, listed by company alphabetically. The American‘ Smelting
and Reﬁning pact, which established last year’s pattern, including
the breakthrough on security-severance payments, now also in
effect at Kennecott, U. S. Metals, Apex Smelting, Phelps Dodge,
Magma, and Inspiration, heads the list:

AS&R Wages, 8 cents per hour. Sickness and accident benefit
raised from $55 to $60 per week. (One additional holiday
became effective Jan. 1, as did improved vacations: 3
weeks after 12 years service; one additional day each
year between 21 and 24 years of sevice.)

 A Statement By Your International Officers

Repeal l4(b), An Anti-Labor Hypocrisy

The “right-to-work" is a noble objective. No one is against full employment or
man's right to work.

Section ldlbl of the Taft-Hartley law has promoted and encouraged companies, em-
ployer associations, and state legislatures to attain passage of state laws outlawing “union
shops." Nineteen states (most of them in the South and West) now have such laws. in every
case, they were promoted under the slogan of “right-to-work.” In every state during the past
18 years, this deceitful and misleading slogan was used to fool the people.

Such laws never produced one job nor protected any man's right to work. “Right-to-work"
laws did, however, encourage runaway scab shops, cheap labor, discrimination in hiring, child
labor, and threats and discharges against workers who supported union organization.

A National Right to Work Committee was spawned and financially supported by hundreds
of corporations. This committee, which has now for T8 years been directing well-heeled propa
ganda campaigns in state after state, was successful in getting a total of 24 states to adopt
such legislation. Five states have since repealed their “right-to-work" laws, after the people and
decent politicians in those states learned from experience that such laws accomplished nothing
except division and class warfare.

Mine-Mill Members Learned the Hard Way

- Our union has many local unions and close to 50 percent of its membership in ll] of these
“right-to-work” states. We have had considerable experience with these state laws. We have
often been the target of vicious campaigns in these states. We have often fought against dis-
torted propaganda so massive that few people were able to discuss such legislation with any
degree of sanity.

Today, this same National Right to Work Committee and other anti-labor forces are beat-
ing the drums again in a massive press, radio and television campaign to stop the repeal of
l4lbl now being considered by Congress. Their cry is the same—freedom from seniority restric
tions, freedom from strikes, freedom to negotiate separately with the boss, freedom from labor
bosses, etc., etc. What they really mean is freedom for the company to cut wages, discharge 
and fire, eliminate job security, seniority, pensions, and all forms of union contract protection ‘

DENVER CONTINUED TO MUCK ITSELF OUT as the Union =
goes to press, after suffering its worst natural disaster in
history on Tune 16 and 17. Swollen by torrential rains, the’.
South Platte River and other tributaries overflowed——flood-

ing many areas of the city. Damage in the metropolitan
area, estimates of which kept spiraling upwards, hit at
least $130 million, and 15 or more lives were lost in the ’
state. Flooding later spread into eastern Coloradoand
Kansas, with residents along the Arkansas River being ’
evacuated. Hardest hit in Denver were the southwest part

-of the city and Globeville, an area near the AS&R Globe’
refinery, which itself escaped damage. Four members of
Mine-Mill Local 557 were flooded out——Richard Beauchamp,
Mike Ortega, Mike Turk, and Tohn Gettman, the latter a 
retired worker. LEVEL REACHED BY THE MUDDY TOR-- V
RENT is clearly seen in the picture above. With a 27-county
disaster area in Colorado proclaimed by President Tohnson,
federal funds will ‘be available to help repair-bridges,
roads, and other public facilities. But, while emergency
assistance was provided, the damage sustained by indi-
viduals and families is permanent. VAST AMOUNTS OF
HOUSEHOLD FURNISHINGS ARE UNSALVAGEABLE; ‘as
"bottom photo indicates. Many homes, too, are beyond’-
repair. - c

Collective Bargaining Is the Policy of the U.S.t

ltis a federal law and public policy of the United States to encourage collective bargain-
ing. The union shop is the form of union security permitted under the National Labor Relations 
Act. It is therefore illogical and contradictory to undermine this federal labor policy in Section '
l4lbl of the law, by inviting states to pass laws which restrict union security and disrupt col-
lective bargaining. if Congress repeats Section l4lbl, it will simply correct a serious contradic-
tion that now-exists in the law. . . .
, Repeal of Section l4lbl won't change the contract now in effect. lt-won't permit a
' “closed shop." it won't change anyone's rights or privileges under the law or the contract.
, will simply remove the restriction against union security in those 19 “right-to-work" states. All
 unions will then be free to negotiate improved union security or a union shop in any state if
 the company will agree. We all know this isn't an easy job with any company.

That's why every union member who is concerned about his own job security and standard
of living should support the effort to repeal Section l4lbl of the Taft-Hartley Act now before
Congress. ’ .

PropertyOrganized

MILWAUKEE, Wisc.—Defeating a bitter campaign
by the company against the union organizers, Mine-Mill
won bargaining rights at the Mid-City Foundry here in
an NLRB election on June 17. The vote was '79 to 34 for
no union, with almost 100 percent of the eligible workers

participating in the election.

Already unfair labor practices charges have been
filed against the company, which continues to try to in-
timidate many of the employees. Jimmy McGee and
Willie Boston, two of the-key workers involved in the

organizing campaign, were sus-
pended by Mid—City following
the vote.

Mine-Mill Board Member
Raymond Dennis and James
Pinta, business agent of the
Chicago Amalgamated L o c al
No. 758, initiated the organiza-
tional drive in April and formed
a committee of plant workers
to help follow through with the
campaign. That same month,
workers at the Allied Smelting
Corporation, a small secondary
lead smelter in Milwaukee, voted
to affiliate with Mine-Mill.

lCheck on Inco Petition

TORONTO, Ontario — A pre-
liminary check by the Ontario
Labor Relations Board of Mine-
Mill application cards for an
election at the International
Nickel Company’s mines and
plants at Sudbury indicated
that the union still has over 49
percent of the workers signed
up, in spite of the hiring of sev-
eral hundred new employees by
the company and the quits or
retirement of men who had
signed Mine-Mill cards.

This fact was revealed at the
formal hearing on June 15 by
the OLRB on the union’s appli-
cation. Under the labor law of
the province, a minimum of
45 percent of the eligible voters

in the bargaining unit must_

have signed cards before an
election will be ordered. In
addition, a worker must pay a
one dollar initiation fee when
he signs.

No date was set for further
hearings, but the board is ex-
pected to forward further in-
formation on the application to
the union in the near future,
following a more detailed check.

Local 598 President Nels Thi-
bault expressed his satisfaction
with the results of the hearing,
which were later in the week
passed on to the Sudbury work-
ers at special meetings called
for that purpose. The most
significant statement on the
hearing perhaps came from
Wilfred List, Globe and Mail
labor correspondent, who is a
CBC commentary on June 17
said: “Two yearspago, no one
would have given a chance to
the Mine-Mill union for a come-
back in the nickel industry. So
many factors seemed weighed
against them,-it seemed impos-
sible. But here they are!”

Skinner in Canada

On June 12, Mine-Mill Interna-
tional President Al Skinner,
speaking to a packed special
membership meeting of Local
598, congratulated the workers
on the filing of the application-—
an action he termed “the great-
est organizational development
in thg metal mining industry in
the past decade.”

Commenting on the organiza-
tion of new properties by Mine-
Mill in the past year and the
union’s successful defense
against attempted raids by the
“When
we win at Sudbury, we will not
only be on the offensive, but al-
so on the high road.”

ment, Mine-Mill Local 598 at a

Explosion Kills Tueson liner
llt Anaconda Exploraton Site

TUCSON, Ariz.——Octavio Bobby Hernandez, 24, was
killed instantly on June 20 in a premature dynamite ex-
plosion at the ‘Twin Buttes exploration mine of the Ana-
conda Copper Company, located about 20 miles south of
downtown Tucson. He had transferred only a week before
to the exploration project from the Christmas mine near
Hayden, where he had been a member of Mine-Mill Local
586, the Miami Miners Union.

Working at the 880-foot level of the shaft with six
other men who escaped injury, Hernandez was blown
some 25 feet from where he was trying to set a charge
when the dynamite exploded. The accident, occuring in
;connection with drilling and blasting operations, took

place in the east face of a tun-
nel, about 250 feet and around a
corner from where the other
members of the crew were
working.

Foreman Arthur Hendrickson
said that the crew had drilled
16 or 18 of 20 blasting holes and

that a couple of them had filled,

with water. “Hernandez was
having trouble with water in the
drill holes,” he continued, “and
then I heard the blast go off-
too soon.”

The Tucson miner was experi-
enced in drilling and blasting
operations. .

Congressmen Get Reports

Although the Twin Buttes
workers are not represented by
any union at the present time,
the officers of the Arizona Mine-
Mill Council sent a report -on

the accident to the .state’s three,
Congressmen, urging them to »
usesuch information in support

of federal mine safety legisla-
tion. A bill which would set up
federal standards of safety for
metal and mineral v mines and
mills is expected to come up for
a Vote on the floor of the House
some time this month.

The union council, which also
asked that the U. S. Bureau of
Mines be allowed to investigate
the accident, said it would con-
tinue to inform Arizona’s Con-
gressmen of mattersrelating to
the safety and health of work-
ers in the industry. Willard A.
Glenn, a deputy state mine in-
spector who made a preliminary
investigation, said there was
evidence that “a small chain
reaction type of explosion oc-
curred.” '

Hernandez is survived by his
wife, Marie; a son, Robert
David, 2; and his parents,-Mr.
and Mrs. Alfred Hernandez of
Tucson. ,

several anti-union leaflets to the
workers, Mid-City offered sev-
eral of the employees wage in-
creases ranging from 5 to 10
cents an hour prior to the elec-
tion date. The company, during
the campaign, announced that
it would start paying time and
a half after eight hours of work
in a day.

Present Conditions

Wages at the plant,‘ which
deals in iron castings and alloy
iron, are for some employees
as low as $1.69 per hour. Piece-
work earnings have not been
raised in five, and in some
cases more, years. There is no
pension plan at the property.

The company is protesting
the conduct of the election to
the NLRB, claiming that the
union issued improper leaflets
and that crayon messages writ-
ten on the walls at the plant
had urged the employees to
vote “yes” on the question of
union representation.

With several other small un-
organized properties in the
vicinity, Dennis and Pinta ex-
pect to continue their organiza-
tional work.

July l5 Strike Date
Set at Ground Hog

VANADIUM, N.M. -—- Ground
Hog miners, members of Mine-
Mill Local 890 in Bayard, have
given the American Smelting
and Refining Company a strike
deadline of July 15—having car-
ried a recent strike vote by 89
to 1. The company has been at-
tempting in negotiations to im-

prove a sub-standard settlement "

on the Ground Hog workers, who

are determined to achieve a‘

contract comparable to those
covering other AS&R employees.

The mine, which began oper-
ation about the turn of the cen-
tury and has been part of the
AS&R chain since 1928, was re-
opened late last year after hav-
ing been closed since 1957.

February Election

Early in February, Mine-Mill
again gained bargaining rights
at the mine and the Company’s
mill in Deming, defeating the
United Steelworkers of Ameri-
ca in an NLRB election by a 3 to
2 ratio. The company had
forced the election when it an-
nounced that it would not ne-
gotiate on the reopened proper-
ties with Local_ 890, which al-
ways had represented their
workers in the past.

Last year’s agreement be-
tween Mine—Mill and AS&R,
which set an industry-wide pat-
tern, provided 24 cents an hour
in wage increases over three
years, established the security-
severance program for the first
time in the industry, completely
eliminated the employee contri-
bution to the health and welfare
program, which was also ‘sub-
stantially improved, and pro-
vided an additional holiday
(making a total of eight) and an
improved vacation schedule.

The total work force is ex-
pected eventually to reach about
230.

Telegrams or letters of sup-

port for the workers in the

stalled bargaining sessions will
be appreciated, and should be
sent to S. Q. (Chano) Merino,

Butte Celebration on June 13 Gets Gold Medal

BUTTE, MbNT.——-Rain, snow, and sleet failed to deter Butte miners, their families
and friends in this and surrounding areas from showing up at Columbia Gardens on
Sun., June 13 to celebrate Butte Miners Union Day. Postponed until a sunny June 24
were the free rides for the children on the roller coaster, bi—planes, and merry-go-
round, but the other regular features of the holiday took place as scheduled.

Founded in 1878, a year before Butte became a chartered city, the union
marked its 87th anniversary by giving away huge amounts of ice cream and cotton
candy and by sponsoring a free public dance that evening at the pavilion.

the morning with the annual first aid contest, sponsored by the Anaconda Company,

-team copped the top prize of

$300, while the next four teams
received lesser amounts._ Twen-
ty groups competed _in this larg-
est industrial first aid contest in
the nation.

The Steward Miners, who fin-
ished fourth a year‘ ago, had
also won first place in 1963.

Safety Awards
Three members of Mine-Mill
Lo-cal 1 were recipients of
Joseph A. Holmes Safety As-
sociation certificates, which pro-
vide recognition for 40 or more

« years of work in the industry

without a lost-time accident.
Joseph Kranjac, a pipeman, and
Howard Pearce and Melvin Dix-
on, both watchmen, received the
40-year awards, while Clive
Thomas, John Lacey, and Frank
Spritzer, Jr., all miners, re-
ceived 30-year certificates. Sev-
eral other employees — salaried
personnel or members of vari-
ous craft unions—also won the
awards, which were presented
by W. L. Smith, chief safety
engineer for the Butte opera-
tions.

Holmes, in whose name the

awards are granted, was the

first director of the federal Bu-
reau of Mines.

William Gately, custodian for
Local 1, chaired tl1e committee
making arrangements for the
holiday. Also serving were Regi-
nald Beavis, president of the
Butte Miners Union, Max Sala-
zar, the financial secretary, and
John Glase, recording secretary,
as well as the members of the
local’s executive board and its
all mines committees.

First Aid Contest
Each first aid team was com-
posed of six men—a captain, a
patient, and four other mem-
bers. In addition to the prize
money going to the top five

' teams, each participant received

$81.65 for practice and contest
time (a four-week training peri-
od preceded the event), a white
sports shirt, and a pair of
trousers.

The contest consisted of three
problems, each counting 500
points for a perfect solution, for
a possible total of 1500. Lester
subdistrict manager
for the Bureau of Mines from
Salt Lake City, served as chief
judge, while Donald E. Martin,
safety representative from the

‘same office, was an arbitrator.
E. W. (Mike) Felegy of Lake-
wood, Co1o., acting manager for
"District E, made the presenta-

tion of awards.

MAIDEN ROCK, Mont.—Some 100 miners, including John
Turk, 48, of Butte, were on hand June 11 at the Stauffer Chemical
Company mines here to watch James F. Novak receive a gold
medal for heroism.

Novak, 22, also of Butte, became one of only 10 persons this

year to be awarded the Joseph A. Holmes Safety medal. A mem-’ A
ber of Mine-Mill Local 904 in Melrose, the young miner had risked .

his own life on Dec. 10, 1964 to bring his partner, Turk, out of a
caving, untimbered section of stope at the East LaMarche opera-

 

tion.

Founded in 1916, the Joseph A. Holmes Safety Association,
named after the first director of the U. S. Bureau of Mines, has

as its goal the perpetuation of
his efforts in the area of safety.

Lester D. Knill, subdistrict
director for the Bureau of
Mines from Salt Lake City,
made the presentation to Novak,
saying, “All miners here and
elsewhere share in this award.
For what a man can do under
the gun is determined to a great
extent in the association he has
with others, especially in under-
ground work.” The medal was
inscribed, “For displaying ex-
ceptional courage with little re-
gard for his own safety in
rescuing John Turk, who was
struck and knocked unconscious
in a fall-of ground in the East
LeMarche phosphate mine, Mel-
rose.”

Congratulatory Messages

Mayor Thomas F. Powers of
Butte extended congratulations
at the ceremonies on behalf of
that city’s citizens, and con-
gratulatory telegrams were re-

ceived from U.S. Senators Mike '

Mansfield and Lee Metcalf of
Montana, Rep. Arnold Olsen,
Gov. Tim Babcock, and H. W.

Kopp of the company’s execu-

tive department in Nashville,

Tenn.

Joe Seymour, superintendent
of the East LaMarche, spoke of
the importance of the “buddy
system” in mining, through

which less experienced miners "

gain knowledge of the work.

Novak had been on the job for 1
less than a year, when the . .

cave-in occurred, while Turk
has been mining for about 20
years. Charles Bogetto, safety
engineer for the mines, served
as master of ceremonies. ‘

Novak was cleaning a chute in’ '

a stope, about 60 feet from Turk,
when he heard the fall of ground.

Ignoring the falling rock, he-

rushed to his unconscious part-
ner and‘ pulled him to safety.
During this time, the a ground
was still sluffing, and, within
minutes after the rescue, sev-
eral tons of rock fell, which
could have buried both men. _

Novak, a native of Minnesota, .

was not injured and Turk es-

caped with only bruises, al-

though his helmet was crushed.

Locos Lend Support to

Conspiracy Case Defense

With defense attorneys preparing a petition asking for a review
of the “conspiracy” case by the U.S. Supreme Court, which in the
past has thrown out every case directed at a Mine-Mill officer to
get that far, Mine-Mill locals around the country during the past
month have again been discussing the case an_d have responded,
in many cases, with new or increased pledges of voluntary financial

contributions and resolutions of support for the six past and present
union officers involved in the case. '

Attorneys Telford Taylor, Nathan Witt, and George Francis
will file the petition for review sometime this month, although the
high court is recessed until October. If it agrees at that time to

review the case, arguments
probably will be heard some-
time in the fall or winter, with
a decision likely to be handed
down prior to the court’s ad-
journment in June, 1966.
Although the Federal Court of
Appeals in Denver upheld the
conviction of the six defendants
on the charge of conspiracy to
defraud the government by fil-
ing false non-Communist affida-
vits and refused late last month
a new hearing of the defendants’
appeal, two recent decisions by

tions in the “conspiracy” case
which will substantially strength-

In their petition to the su-

neys will deal with the funda-
mental issue involving the na-
ture of the indictment itself, say-
ing it was legally defective’ to
begin with. The sufficiency of
the evidence will again be chal-
lenged, and many other issues
will be raised.

History of Attacks

, Throughout the union's 72-year
history, Mine-Mill has been sub-
ject to various legal and other
anti-union atta-cks-—-all of which
have been defeated. At its April
meeting, the international execu-
tive board expressed unqualified
confidence in the eventual re-
versal of the convictions in the
“conspiracy” case—-only the lat-
est in the long series of attempts
to weaken a militant union.

Throughout its history, too,
the solidarity of the local unions

have’ played a major. role in re- ‘ '

pulsing the attacks on Mine-Mill.

Local 485 Member Appointed
To Utah Mine Inspector Post

Utah Governor Calvin Rampton recently named longtime Mine-
Mill member Robert Peterson as a state mine inspector — an
appointment which, in the opinion of Local 485 in Binghain Canyon,
substantially strengthens Utah’s inspection organization.

Peterson fills one of two positions as inspectors of metal and
non-coal mines. In addition, there are two inspectors who survey

coal and potash properties. The
four men submit reports to the
state’s three-man In (1 u s trial
Commission.
Extensive Experience

A member of the Bingham
Canyon Open Pit Miners’ Union,
Peterson has had many years
of experience in both mining and

, smelting. At the age of 15, he

.,went to work in an underground

 lead-zinc mine at Bauer, Utah.

He has worked in the Lark and
Tintic areas, has leased in mines
throughout the state, and, dur-
ing slack periods, has been em-
ployed in various types of con-
struction work. In 1932 and ’33,
he put in a hitch driving tunnels
and scaling at Boulder Dam.
Joining Mine-Mill in 1937, Pe-

 

MAX SALAZAR, the finan-
cial secretary of the Butte

Miners’ Union, last month

was named by the mayor’

and county commissioners
as as member of the board
of directors of the War on
Poverty program for Butte

_ and Silver Bow County. Al-

tough the program is just
getting started with the ap-
pointment of the board, sev-
eral of the directors already
have various projects in
mind.

UAWWdkers
Still Striking

Anaconda Plant

, TORONTO, Ontario — S o in e
1150 workers at the Anaconda
American Brass Company -plant
here, who struck on April 20,
are still out as this issue goes to

~ press. In letters to the Buffalo,



N.Y. Anaconda employees, the
company has stated that “there
appears to be no realistic basis
for a settlement until the union’s
proposals are altered to closely
compare with what the company
is prepared to grant.”

The union involved is Local
399 of the United Auto Workers,
which maintains that the Ana-
conda proposal on wages alone
is 6 to 10 cents per hour below
other major agreements, and
that the company offer on
fringes is also far inferior. The
workers are pressing, too, for
major improvements in the pen-
sion program.

Responding quickly to the

, company letter, Mine-Mill Local
593 in Buffalo, in a letter from

International Representative Jo- ,

seph Scioli to Stephen J . Harris,
assistant director of the Indus-
trial Union Department of the
AFL-CIO, asked that a confer-
ence of all Anaconda Brass lo-
cals be convened in order to de-
velop united support for the Tor-
onto strikers. _

Scioloi said’ the breakdown in
negotiations _at Toronto could be
blamed on Anaconda, who so

“arrogant statement speaks for,

itse .”

 

 

terson has been extremely ac-
tive in union affairs. He at vari-
ous periods served as vice-presi-
dent of the state CIO, recording
secretary at the Butterfield lo-
cal, and vice-president of old
District Union #2, which was
comprised of Utah and Nevada.
In last summer’s Kennecott
walkout, he was one of five
strikers arrested for “picketing
to interfere with access” and re-
leased on bond during the com-
pany’s three-day attempt to op-
erate its Bingham precipitation
plant with foremen.

Always a strong union sup-
porter who is bitterly opposed to
‘raiding and splintering within
the labor movement, Peterson
also has consistently shown a
deep concern for the safety of
the workers. He has served on
numerous union safety commit-
tees and has carried on cam-
paigns for safe,‘ healthy working
conditions in and around all’ of
the various mines, mills, and
smelters in which he has been
employed.

Senate Passes Coinage Bill on June 24;
House Fight Looms on Silver Content

_ WASHINGTON, D.C._——The Senate, Junel24, passed by a vote of 74 to 9 the administration bill calling for
a historic change in the nation’s coinage. The bill calls for removing all silver from dimes and quarters, and reduc-

the silver content of the half dollar from 90 percent to 40 percent. All three coins would be of the “sandwich”

Future dimes and quarters would have a core of pure copper bonded to thin outer layers of 75 percent copper,"

25. percent n_ickel——the same alloy now used in the five-cent piece. The new half dollars would have cores composed of
21 percent silver, 79 percent copper and surfaces of 80 percent silver, 20 percent copper. No change is proposed in
13:]l(:-llssilver dollar, but none have been minted since 1935 and there are no plans to resume minting in the next few

The nine Senators opposing the bill were from the western states, seven Democrats—Bartlett and Gruening

of Alaska, Bible _of Nevada, Church of Idaho, Jackson and Magnuson of Washington, and Moss of Utah—plus two
Republ1cans—Domin1ck of Colo-

 

Frank Lopez, Leslie Gunnell, Zeke Lopez, Nick Yengich, and Stan Loader. On lune 9, '

rado and Jordan of Idaho. Final
passage came after a_western
attempt to keep 40 percent
silver in the dimes and quar-
ters, and an eastern drive to
eliminate silver altogether from
the half dollar.
Committee
Recommendations
The coinage proposal is sched-

”uled for a vote in the House

before the July 4 weekend. The
House Banking and Currency
Committee is pressing for an
amendment to remove all silver

from the new half dollars, as
well as from dimes and quar-
ters. If this plan prevails in the
House, a Senate-House confer-
ence will make the ultimate
decision as to the half dollar’s
silver content. -
Behind the coinage proposals
is the growing shortage of silver
in the face’ of increasing de-
mand for silver for coinage and
industrial purposes. As recently
as 1960, coinage in the U.S.

required only 46 million ounces
of silver, but 204 million ounces

Report Out on Lead-Zinc Quotas;
No Immediate Action Expected

The U.S. Tariff Commission submitted its long-awaited report
on lead and zinc quotas to President Johnson last month. The
report had been requested more than a year ago by the President,
who asked the commission to consider the economic effects of a
partial or complete elimination of the impo-rt quotas imposed on
lead and zinc by President Eisenhower in 1958.

The commission reported that the lead and zinc. industries W
had recovered from the depression that had led to impositiongof

the quotas, and that greatly improved demand for both metals and

increased profits had resulted
in 1964 and 1965. It found, too,
that there is a world-wide short-
age of both metals and that
this, rather than quota restric-
tions, had discouraged U.S. im-
ports of refined metal and con-
centrates.
commission advised the Presi-
dent that termination of quotas
“would not likely have a detri-
mental effect on domestic (U.S.)
lead and zinc producers unless
world demand for these metals
should subside substantially in
relation to world supplies."
President Johnson is required
by law to seek the advice of the
Secretary of Commerce and the
Secretary of Labor before tak-
ing any action with respect to
the quotas. Trade journals re-
port that he will also. seek the
advice of the Interior and State

Departments, and that no action’

by the President is likely for
several months. ‘ , .

were needed in 1964, with the
great increases in the use of
vending machines and the col-
lecting and hoarding of coins.
In the latter year, for example,
201 million Kennedy half dollars
were minted and, according to
an annual review of silver pub-
lished by Engineering and Min-
ing Journal, nearly all these

S Kennedy half dollars have gone

into collections or hoards. Silver
used in the U.S. for industrial
purposes last year was 11 per-
cent more than in 1963.

Not enough silver is being
produced in the United States or
world-wide to meet combined
coinage‘ and industrial require-
ments. This has been true for
several years, and the shortage
has ‘been met by drawing down
the huge U.S. Treasury stocks
of silver bullion, accumulated
mainly since the Silver Pur-

"chase Act of -1934. These stocks,
I over 2_ billion ounces a little .-

over five years ago, now stand

about 1 "billion ounces. - 9 Last 
year,\ Treasury stocks, were

drawn down by about 375 - mil-

lion ounces. At this rate ,the . __ , .
U.S.-Treasury’s stocks of silver = ducmn Wm‘ the new Sandwmh

bullion would be exhausted in
three more years.

Mine production of silver has
been slow to respond to the in-
crease in the price from about

, 92 cents per ounce three and

one-half years ago to $1.29,
where it has been pegged for
the last two years. One reason
is that about two-thirds of U.S.
mine production of silver is
recovered from copper, lead,
and zinc ores.

U.S. mine production last
year, a little over 36 million
ounces, was up barely 12/3 mil-
lion ounces over 1961. The
American Mining Congress

projects an increase to about ’

44 million ounces by 1968, on

- the basis of new silver discover-

ies, mainly in Nevada, Idaho,
and Utah. These increases in

production, if achieved, would"

by no means match the growth
in the industrial use of silver.

_ Treasury in a Bind

The U.S. Treasury is in a real
bind that is likely to continue
for the next two or three years.
The Treasury is selling silver
from its stocks to industrial
users to keep the price pegged
to $1.29 per ounce. If it stopped
selling, it fears the price might
go up —- perhaps to $2.00 per
ounce or more. Once the price
passed $1.38 per ounce, the sil-
ver in present coins would be
worth more than face valueand
it would become profitable to
melt them down.

A Treasury study suggests
that most of the silver coins now
in circulation would then disap-
pear. This would create a para-
lyzing coin shortage unless there
were other coins on hand to take

the placeofsilver. _ V
passage of I-the coinage.  A
whatever its“final form, will

greatly‘ reduce the drain on
Treasury stocks imposed by cur-
rent minting requirements, ' and
enable the min-t to get into pro-

coins. This will give_the Treas-
ury more time in which to keep
the price of silver static and
thus prevent an abrupt disap-

pearance of the silver coins now

in circulation.
Huge Difference in Cost

New silverless coins would

mean big savings for the U.S.
Treasury. To make $1,000 worth
of silver quarters costs the gov-
ernment more than $900, but the

same amount of the proposed.

silverless sandwich q u a r t er 8

would cost slightly less than $60

in metal and fabricating costs. V

The security-severance programs, which in most cases provide

into effect last year. New in the industry, they protect employees
at critical periods-—layoff or retirement—by providing a fund to
be drawn upon at those times.

Payments to 55" Kennecott workers through April 30, 1965 have
totaled $111,746.38—an average of $2,031.75. It is estimated that
the security-severance payments throughout the industry from‘_
July 1, 1964 to June 30, 1965 could well exceed $500,000. '

Other breakthroughs in last year’s settlements included a 25

at Inspiration that covers all past and future retirees and their
wives, and complete elimination of employee contribution toward

common contract expiration date at its Cleveland and Chicago
lants, also required a strike. Some 165 members of Mine-Mill
cal5735 in Cleveland hit the bricks for 51 days before Apex, a
ision of American Metal Climax, came to terms late in Novem-
r. The last of the major Mine-Mill contracts reached in 1964, the
"cement continued the excellent record of Apex workers setting
gw standards of security in the secondary smelting industry. A
sgcurity-sever_ance package providing $70 per year of service was
on. . . -
Most settlements came only after overwhelming strike votes on
thelpart of the membership.

-The outstanding success achieved in last year’s round of bar-

Mill workers throughout the industry, and the near unanimous
trike votes that wereachieved at property after property. Strikes,
hen they occurred, were solid. The National Wage Policy Con-
erence,"Aheld in Tucson, Arizona in January, 1964 and attended by

Discussion of pensions will undoubtedly -be on the agenda at
the international convention in August. Last. year’s experience
hows thata solid set of demands, developed well in advance of
ﬂctual negotiations, can be won. The muscle, the determination,
the unity is there, as the union’s achievements in 1964 once again
proved without doubt.

Many Killed, llo Murder Gonvietions
In Southern Struggle for Freedom

by Asbury Howard
International Vice-President
ITH SOME 700 PERSONS in jail in Jackson, Mississippi for
demonstrating against the state's denial of the right to vote,

another 100 marchers on June 21, softly singing freedom songs,
filed through Philadelphia, Mississippi on a 12-mile pilgrimage to

‘ the burned ruins of the Mount Zion Methodist Church.

The Jackson demonstrations, sponsored by the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party, are aimed at a special session of the
state legislature, called by Gov. Paul Johnson to consider changes
in the state’s voting laws. MFDP spokesmen contend that Missis-
sippi is desperately attempting to keep federal registrars out of
the state and also trying to head off a challenge which could un-
seat its ”five Congressmen. Charging that the Congressmen were
illegally elected, since Negroes who constitute over 40 percent of
the population of the state were systematically denied the right to
participate in the elections, the MFDP also contends that the
legislature is illegally constituted for the same reason and has no
right to hold sessions. _ _ _

Staging the first such civil rights
march in Neshoba County, the 100 persons
in Philadelphia made the long journey in
memory of three civil rights worl<_ers—_two
white New Yorkers and a Mississippi
Negro—who had been slain just a year
ago, hours after they had visited the burn-
ed church. _

Among the Neshoba County deputies
and auxiliary police directing traffic along
part of the route was. Chief Deputy Cecil
Price. Sheriff Lawrence Rainey had dri-
en out of town just before the march got
underway. Price and Rainey were among
the 18 white men who were arrested on
federal civil rights charges in the deaths
of the three civil rights workers — James E. Chaney, Andrew
Goodman, and Michael H. Schwerner. The charges were later
thrown out. There was no prosecution.

INCE THE LUNCH-COUNTER SIT-INS began in 1960, 25 per-

sons are known to have been slain in the South for reasons

directly related to civil rights activities. Over 40 churches have

been destroyed or damaged by fire or bombs in the last two years
alone.

In the 25 killings, three cases produced verdicts of guilty of
manslaughter. One involved the death of a white man in which
three Negroes were sent to prison; a second involved the death of
a Negro in which two white youths were found guilty but not sent
to prison; in the third, a white man received a 10-year sentence.
There have been no murder convictions. A review of the 25 slay-
ings follows: -

NINETEEN-SIXTY-FIVE—Four Deaths

Deputy Sheriff O’Neal Moore was shot and killed by night
riders in Bogalusa, La. His partner, Creed Rogers, was seriously
wounded. One arrest. No trial yet. Released on $25,000 bond.

Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, a Detroit mother of five and wife of a
Teamsters official, was killed on Highway 80 between Selma and
Montgomery, Ala. on the night the Freedom March ended. The
next day, President Johnson told the nation, “She was murdered
by the enemy of justice who for decades have used the rope and
the gun, the tar and the feathers to terrorize their neighbors. They
stuck by night, as they generally do, for their purpose cannot
stand the light of day.” Three Ku Klux Klansmen were indicted.
One trail resulted in a hung all-white jury.

Rev. James Reeb, a Boston minister, was beaten on a Selma
street and died two days later in a Birmingham hospital. Three
indicted on murder charges. No trial.

Jimmie Lee Jackson, a Negro youth, was killed in a voter

« registration demonstration in Marion, Ala. Officials later. said that

a state trooper had done it. No arrest.
1964-Seven Deaths

Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner were slain shortly after
having been released from a Philadelphia, Miss. jail. No prosecu-
tion.

Lemuel Penn, a Washington, D.C. educator, was gunned down
as he drove home from Army reserve duty at Fort Benning, Ga.
Four Klansmen were arrested, three indicted for murder, and two
tried. Despite a confession from one which implicated the rest, they
were acquitted. ‘; , . ,

.Hubert Ormsby, a,yo,un,g Mississippi Negro, was found floating
in the Big Black River, wearing a. CORET-shirt. The verdict was
accidental drowing. . '  j I - '

' Louis Allen,‘a Mississippi youth who reportedly had witnessed

an earlier killing of a Negro civil rights worker, was himself

slain. No arrest. ' _. .

Mrs. Johnnie Mae‘ Chappell, a Jacksonville, Fla. Negro woman,

followed the bombing. No arrest. '

Virgil Ware was killed the same day by a white youngster
with a pistol, who was riding with a friend on a motorscooter. Con-

international union is consider-
ing, should the measure be
passed without providing cover-
age for smelters and refineries,
the introduction of another bill
which would direct the Secretary
of the Interior to make a study
of the health and safety prob-
lems at these properties —— a
study which undoubtedly would
prove the need for a federal
safety program in this area.

With Congress expected to re-
cess in August, it is probable
that no action will be taken on
the mine safety bill in the Senate
until after it reconvenes in Jami-
ary.

Annual Inspections

Two specific provisions asked
by most of the labor groups
which testified at the May hear-
ings are now included in the bill
—one requiring inspections no
less frequently than on an annu-
al basis, the other vesting feder-
al responsibility for administra-
tion of the act specifically with
the Bureau of Mines rather than
with another agency of the De-
partment of the Interior.

The bill also calls for expand-
ed federal programs of health
and safety education and train-
ing for mine operators, manag-

ers, supervisors, and employees. _

In states without an approved
plan of its own, criminal penal-
ties are provided for one speci-
fied offense—the failure to com-
ply with an order to withdraw
personnel from a mine where an
immediate danger exists that
could cause death or serious
physical harm. Upon conviction
in federal court on this charge,
mine operators could be fined
from $100 to $3,000 and impris-
oned for up to 60 days.

First Eastern Smelting and Refining
Meeting Held in Baltimore on June 18

BALTIMORE, Md. -— An Eastern smelting and re-

fining conference, conceived at the Mine-Mill District 5 ‘

conference held earlier this year, met for the first time‘ 
here on June 18. Twenty delegates, representing workers 
at five nearby smelting and refining operations, attended ,

to discuss political action, future negotiations, and the

day-to-day problems with the companies.

Executive Board Member Alfred Petit-Clair. was
named coordinator of the council. It was agreed that the
group would meet at least twice a year or at the call of

the coordinator. Regular news
letters will inform the locals of
developments of concern to
them.

Representing perhaps the
largest number of smelter and
refinery workers concentrated
in any one area of the country,
the delegates were unanimous
in the desire to strengthen the
relationship between their locals
in preparation for the round of
negotiations in 1967. They
agreed, too, to push for addi-
tional federal safety legislation,
such as an act to study safety
conditions in smelters and re-
fineries, if these properties
should not be covered by the

 

mine safety legislation now be-
fore Congress.

The program of the interna--lg

NLRB Ruling on Journeyman's Test

The National Labor Relations Board recently,_..,__ru1ed against
Plumbers Union Local 2 in New York. The order stated that the
local‘ could not require four men—three Negroes and a Puerto

worker’s competence and ordered back pay for the four men who

AS&R Unfair, Says
Idaho M-M Local

KELLOGG, Idaho—Mine-Mill
Local 18, which represents some
540 workers at the Page and
Galena mines in the Coe_ur
d’Alene -district, ﬁled unfair la-
bor practices charges early last
month against the American
Smelting and Refining Company,
maintaining that the company
should be required to reopen
negotiations with the union on
the health and welfare program.

AS&R has imtil July 1 to file
an answer to the charge.
Thomas P. Graham, Jr., re-
gional director for the National
Labor Relations Board, also set
a hearing before an NLRB trial
examiner for August 17 at the
Shoshone County Courthouse in
Wallace. 1

The local union, in its com-
plaint, charged that AS&R com-
mitted an unfair labor practice
by changing the insurer for the
health and welfare program
without notifying the local and
allowing it to negotiate on such
a change. At the beginning of
this year, the company began
self insuring the health and wel-
fare plan, which previously had
been handled by Metropolitan.

When Local 18 was informed
of the change, after it had been
made, it requested a reopening
of bargaining on the program.
AS&R refused to accede to this
proposal. -

The present three-year con-

tract between Local 18 and"

AS&R runs through December,
1966.

A little over a year ago, the
company was found guilty of en-
gaging in unfair labor practices
in refusing to bargain collective-
ly at Page and Galena, while
making unilateral changes in
the contract provisions at its
expiration. When the new con-
tract was signed, the company
paid an average of about $265
per worker in back pay.

from Utah’s 2nd Congressional
District, is strongly in favor of
repealing 14( b). Following are
excerpts from a lengthy state-
ment by King in which he ex-
plains why:

During the campaign, I sol-
emnly pledged to work for the
removal of the causes of unnec-
essary conflict between manage-
ment and labor. It is my opinion
that Section 14(b) is one of those
causes of unnecessary conflict.
It has helped to create feelings
of justifiable dissatisfaction,
which, in turn, have led to
strikes and work stoppages and
to losses in production, profits,
and wages. In my opinion, 14(b)
is not only unfair, but inconsist-
ent with the foundation of our
whole structure of American la-
bor law.

By opposing this law, there-
fore, I am keeping faith with the
people of my state and the na-
tion, and, what is more impor-
tant,_ with my own conscience.

The Taft-Hartley 14(b) issue is
the most ‘misunderstood issue to-
day. Let me clear up a few mis-
conceptions:

Misconception: If 14(b) is re-
pealed, every worker in Utah
will be unionized.

Fact: If 14(b) is repealed, un-
ion membership will be required
only in the event that a majority
of the workers in a shop vote
for it. In the state of Utah, many
shops have rejected unioniza-
tion. They will still be free to
do so.

Misconception: If 14(b) is re-
pealed, it will take away a work-
er’s free agency and his God-
given right to work.

Fact: As pointed out above,
union membership will become
one condition of employment
only where a majority asks for
it in a democratically-conducted

election. Today over 95 percent
of all workers are required to
participate in the Social Securi-
ty program. Almost 100 percent
of them are required to permit
deductions from their salary
check for federal, and frequent-
ly, state income taxes. No one
seriously argues that these nec-
essary restrictions constitute a
denial of the worker’s free agen-
cy, or of his “right to work.”

Under the law, unions are re-
quired to perform many valu-
able services for the workers
(such as giving them free rep-
resentation in a grievance pro-
ceeding). It certainly cannot be
argued that requiring a worker
to help defray the cost of such
services is any more a denial of
his free agency than requiring

him to help defray the cost of '

government through payroll de-
duction.

Misconception: Apart from la-

boring people, no one is re-_

quired to join an organization
before he can earn a living.

Fact: On the contrary, it is
quite customary for men en-
gaged in a common profession
to band together in a tightly-
knit, and frequently compulsor-
ily-imposed, professional organi-
zation. Unlike labor unions, the
Bar Association doesn’t even
give its members the right to
vote on the question of compul-
sory membership.

Collective Bargaining
Process Endangered

It is argued, and I think per- -

suasively, that if labor and man-
agement are not free to enter
into a union shop agreement, the
collective bargaining p r o c e s s
faces a serious danger. It means
that some laborers in a particu-
lar shop will reap the vast bene-
fits which their bargaining

agent, the union, won for them, -
without carrying the cost of .

those benefits. This, in turn, will
weaken the effectiveness of the
union in carrying out the duties
which the law has assigned to it
to perform. It will create un-
rest and dissatisfaction among
the workers who very under-

standably resent carrying the»
- load of the nonparticipators.

Let us suppose that in a par-
ticular establishment, a labor
union has succeeded over a 40-
year period in raising wages
from $4 per day to $20 per day,
and in securing many fringe
benefits.

Now we come to the case of
John Doe who begins working at
the establishment. He receives
all the benefits which the union
has secured for him —— including
high wages, fringe benefits, free
representation in grievance pro-
ceedings, etc. But John Doe does
not want to join the iuiion. He
makes no effort, however, to
divest himself of all these bene-
fits. He does not offer to go back

‘to $4 per day, or to forfeit his

fringe benefits.

Is thereany wonder that the -

other men, who dutifully pay
their dues every month to de-
fray necesgi-Loy union expenses,

resent this man’s attitude? Is

there any wonder that this uii- I

just situation creates unneces-
sary tension and even strikes?
Keep in mind, too, that John
Doe, if he joins the union, does
not have to take an oath, or per-
form any act or adopt any be-
lief inconsistent with his convic-
tions. If he chooses not to par-

. _ ticiphte in any way in union ac-

tivities, beyond paying his dues,

his job will not be jeopardized. R

My best judgment, based upon
my study of the national picture,‘
is that labor-management fric-
tion will be reduced, and indus-

‘try will be more strike-free, if

THE MINE-MILL, UNION

.S)eI’t6£t0I‘5 (U16! Congre./ximen

we/aredenfing mace ./4r.ea5;

Two bills of critical importance to the membership of Mine-
Mill could well come up for a vote in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives this month —H.R. 8989, which would establish‘ a federal
safety code for metal and mineral mines and mills, and HR. 77,
which would repeal Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act, the
section that allows states to pass laws banning the union shop.
Both bills have been favorably reported by the House Committee

’ on Education and Labor.

Senate hearings on the Section 14(b) issue also were completed
late in June, and, with speedy committee action expected, a floor
vote in that chamber could come rather rapidly.

Congressional support for both measures, therefore, should
be urged in letters both from local unions and individual members.
The address is simply House Office Building or Senate Office
Building, Washington, D. C. Particularly with reference to the
mine safety legislation, it is extremely important that the Con-
gressmen from the East, Mid-West, and South be lined up.

Following is a list of Congressmen and Senators from areas

WASHINGTON, D.C.——Approved 21" to 10 by the House Committee on Education and Labor,  i
77, which would repeal Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act, is expected to be voted upon by ‘the

House this month. Meanwhile, on the Senate side, a subcommittee wrapped up a four-day series of

hearings on a similar bill ‘to end the authority of states to enact so-called “right-to-work” laws.
Repeal of 14(b), said Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz in his testimony, is a “top priority” goal
of the Johnson administration, which will use its full influence in the battle on this issue. » .
Two Republicans on the House Education and Labor Committee. joined 19 Democrats in voting

Voting Rights Bill_ ,
With the Senate having passed

a somewhat amended version of
the Johnson administration's vot-
ing rights bill on May 26 by a '77

to 19 roll-call vote, the battle in 7

the House to strengthen the
measure continued at the end of
June. Led by Chairman Emanu-
el Celler (D-N.Y.), the House
Judiciary Committee added, by
a 19 to 13 count, a provision to
ban poll taxes as a requirement
for state and local elections.
House Speaker John McCormack

(D-Mass.) has vowed to lead the '

fight, expected soon, on this is-
sue on the House floor.

Sen. Edward Kennedy (D- A

Mass.) was joined by Sens. Ja-.

cob Javits (R-N.Y.)‘ and ‘Philip
Hart (D-Mich.) in pushing a poll
tax ban through the Senate. The
proposed amendment was beat-

en there by the narrow margin.

of 49-45. '

House liberals also won bat-
tles in committee to add provi-
sions calling for federal poll
watchers and for protections

against discrimination in the ‘

election of officers of political
parties. With the entire Repub-
lican delegation opposing his
amendment, Rep. Don Edwards
(D-Calif.) led a fight to remove
from the bill a provision requir-
ing prospective registrants to
see a state official before getting
federal assistance. The amend-
ment carried, 16 to 14.

Basic provisions of the admin-

istration bill allow for federal

More News on Missouri

The U. S. Tariff Commission report on lead and zinc, released»

on June 8, states, “Although not yet announced, trade reports
indicate that large mine production capacity, and commensurate
lead smelter capacity,- will be constructed (probably after 1967)
by the Kennecott Copper Co. and the American Smelting and Re-
fining Co.” This is the first indication that Kennecott will con-
struct a lead smelter in Missouri. Development of its new lead
mine, near Ellington, had previously been reported.

Although it has been known that American Smelter and Re-
fining Co. has been prospecting for lead in Missouri, the Tariff
Commission’s report is the first indication that the company has
made a strike and will proceed with mine development and con-
struction of a smelter. Location of the strike has not been an-

nounced. * * * .
U.S. Zinc Mine Production Up ‘

U. S. zinc mines in March produced 54,350 tons, highest since

area, produced more zinc in March than at any time since Septem-

ASARCO "Mexicanized"

vAmerican Smelting and Refining Company announces com-
pletion of arrangements to sell a 51 percent interest in its Mexican
subsidiary to a group of Mexican industrialists. ASARCO will re-
tain, a 49 percent interest in the group of mines, smelters, and
refineries in Mexico that produce gold, silver, lead, zinc, copper,
coal, coke, and other products. Trade sources estimate American
Smelting will receive between $30 and $40 million in the. deal.
The transaction, resulting in “Mexicanization” of the proper-
ties, was concluded pursuant to the Mexican mining law passed in
1961. Major advantage is that the new 51 percent Mexican-owned
company will be allowed a 50 percent reduction in the export tax
on metals mined in Mexico. I

Revere Goes to Arizona

Revere Copper and Brass, Inc., 34.3 percent-owned by Ameri-
can Smelting and Refining Co., may soon become a copper mine
producer in Arizona. Revere has signed an agreement with Zontelli
Western Mining Co. permitting -Revere to explore an oxide copper
property owned by Zontelli 21 miles south of Page, Arizona, on the
Navajo Reservation. Revere also has an option to buy the property.

At present, Zontelli is producing a small volume of precipitate
copper. Revere’s move may be prompted by a pending anti-trust
suit filed by the Justice Department in 1961 to compel American
Smelting to sell its stockholdings in Revere. In the event that the
suit were lost by American Smelting, Revere might wish to be
able to supply a part, at least, of its copper requirements.

SUPERIOR, Ariz. — Mine-Mill
Local 938 and its Ladies Auxil-
iary in the middle of May award-
ed to three local high school grad-
uates scholarships of $250 each
to help them continue their
studies at the college level. Re-
ceiving the grants were two
boys and a girl—Manue1 Juarez,
Jr., Richard Provencio, and
Juanita Sapien. '

The awards mark another
step-up in the scholarship activ-
ities of the union here. In 1961,
when the Local 938 Ladies Aux-
iliary was asked to contribute to
the Superior High School Schol-
arship Fund, a pastry sale was
held and the proceeds, $100, do-
nated. Another sale was held the
following year, -and another $100
donated.

In 1963, only $10 went to the
high school fund. But an en-
closed note, saying, “We intend
to give scholarships ourselves,”
pleased the Superior High School
scholarship committee.

Local 938 joined the ladies
auxiliary in this work in 1964.
The ladies auxiliary donated $50
to start a series of fund—raising
bingo games and raffles. In
March, the local union initiated
a $50 per month donation to the
fund.

Jesus Hernandez, who chose
Arizona State University, and
Lucille Padilla, who went to
Lamson College, each received
scholarships of $250 from the
local and ladies auxiliary last
year. This year, as earlier point-
ed out, the number of students

receiving grants was up to three. .

Mrs. Mary B. Jorquez, who
chaired the union’s scholarship
committee in 1964, again is serv-
ing in that capacity this year.
Carol W. Sargent is the treasur-
er. Other members of the com-
mittee are Mrs. Carol Shackel-V
ford, Mrs. Jessie Schandelmeier,
Mrs. Sally Yniquez, Roy Santa
Cruz, Jr., David Shackelford,
and Henry Noetzel.

More Figureson Accidents Involving Overhead Cranes

A recent survey of 12 years’ experience with fatal accidents involving overhead traveling cranes
in heavy industry indicates four prime causes. The most common, accounting for 38 percent of the
deaths, involved suspended loads striking men below. Twenty-four percent of the fatalities occurred
when the victim was struck by a moving crane. Fifteen percent of those killed were struck by freely-
falling objects, and 15'percent themselves fell from cranes.

- The survey found that most of the fatal accidents occurred during the day shift. About half oc-
curred at floor leveland about half above floor level. Maintenance men suffered two-thirds of the
fatalities occurring above floor level. Of those killed at floor level

Mine Disaster

In Yugoslavia

On June 7, a methane gas ex-
plosion 450 feet down the Orasi
shaft of the Kakanj coal mine
killed 126 Yugoslavian coal min-
ers. A total of about 200 men
were in the mine at the time.
The mine is in central Yugo-
slavia near Sarajevo. Mass fu-
neral services were held in Ka-
kanj, a predominantly Moslem
town. 400 children made father-
less by the explosion were in the
funeral march.

In a period of less than two
weeks, from May 28 to June 7,

«over 700 coal miners were killed"

working directly with the suspended load.

, about half were hookers or others

of back lagging north and south
of 5009 chute were installed or
repaired.

- The sides of the drift on the
5000 level north of 15 stope were
scaled down.

- The hanging walls of 5238
and 5240 stopes were barred
down and an additional stull line
was placed in 5238 stope. ’

0 The_ brow over the drift at
5112 stope was barred down.

0 The sides. of the 5300 level
drift north were barred down‘ all
through this area.

Recommendations

0 Motor generator sets should
be installed on a fire-resistant
material. (Repeated from pre-
vious inspection, report.)

0 Underground
should be installed in fire-resist-
ant rooms. (Repeated from pre-
vious inspection report.)

- Only Bureau of Mines-ap-
proved, mobile, diesel-powered
equipment should be used under“-

, ground. Bureau of M in e s - ap-

substations 1

proved equipment should be
used to replace or add to the
diesel-powered equipment now
in use underground when re-

. placement of present equipment,
or additional equipment, is nec-
essary. ~

-An auxiliary fan and vent
tubing should be installed in 101 '

stope on- the 6000 level.

- A larger volume of ventilat-
ing air should be supplied to the
working face of 4802 drift, south.

Douglas Mine
Safety Improvements Made
Between Inspections

- The waste dump at the Dun-
kleberg adit was floored between
the rails and a catch rail was
provided to prevent the loss of
-a car over the edge of the dump.

- The compressed-air receiver
at the Dunkleberg adit‘ was
equipped with a safety pressure-
relief valve. _

there was the possibility of a
person stepping off the manway
ladder directly into the service

compartment. '

-0 An area on the left rib of
5201 “C” North, was’ barred
down. Ground support was
placed near the face in 5200 “E”
South drift.

Recommendations
- The waste dump slot on the
surface at the Douglas mine

should be covered when not in

use. (Repeated from previous
inspection report.)

0 Men should not stand on cars
to pull chutes. (‘Repeated from’
previous inspection report.) ,

0 Mechanical ventilation suffi-
cient to meet the requirements
of the men and the diesel-pow-
ered locomotives should be pro-
vided. (Repeated from previous
inspection report.) “

0 A fan and vent tubing should
be installed to provide ventila-
tion in the 5401 sublevel south of
“C” North. - '

”§.alzt of the Earth-=w   
The Story of at lpilm” Q  

Of special interest to Mine-Mill members who recall the _c
Empire Zinc strike of 1951 is the publication by Beacon Pressf  
of “Salt of the Earth—The Story of a Film,” by Herbert Biber-
man. ’

Biberman, one of the “Hollywood Ten” who served jail sen-
-tences for contempt of the House UnAmerican Activities Com-.
mittee, was one of a group of blacklisted Hollywood figures who .. -
formed Independent Productions, Inc. to make their own films
when Hollywood refused to hire them. .

‘The book deals with the background and history of their
first venture—a movie entitled “Salt of the Earth,” which was
based on the events of the strike against Empire Zinc by Mine-

r Mill Local 890. It tells the story of the development of the screen-
play by Michael Wilson, the recruiting of actors——some profes-
sionals, but most from among the membership of Local 890 and .
the Silver City community-the events of the strike itself,_ and
the long fight to film, process, and exhibit the picture. ' '

Although the film won the French International Grand Prize’
for the best film of 1955, the regular movie-going public of the . .
United States has had no chance to see it. Biberman’s book ex- -2 
plains why. ’ - « . ‘

In an unusual “Publisher’s Note,” Beacon Press says, “. . . ,
his account . . . raises some important questions, some proper *‘~,j,__
doubts, and even illuminates some of the dark places in our re- V
cent history. . . . This story is important to Americans and should
be read.” _ .
