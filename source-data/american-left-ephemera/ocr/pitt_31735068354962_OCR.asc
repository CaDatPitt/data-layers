DENVER—-—Mine—Mill’s four top officers this month

urged an across-the-board “yes” vote on five important ~

amendments to the International constitution proposed in
the union-wide referendum scheduled to be held on Tues-

day, October 30.

‘President Clark, Vice-Presidents Howard and Skin-
ner, and Secretary-Treasurer Dichter pointed out that all
five constitutional clianges were “overwhelmingly ap-
proved and recommended to the membership of your
Union” by the recent 1962 International co'nventioil‘i‘n

T-oronto.

In a message to the membership prepared '-for ‘publi-
cation in the Mine-Mill Union, the officers emphasized

Union

Choicesscore in

State Primary Contests

Political candidates endorsed by Mine-Mill locals in the last of the -year’s primaries
last month pretty much.made a sweep of their races to square off for the big finals
coming up in the November election. The emphasis in union political activity from now
to Nov. 6 was on final registration and drives to get out the biggest possible_ vote on
election day. Greatesfconcentration was in the western states, where Mine-Mill influ-

ence is expected to make
the difference in the out-

come of numerous national and’

state contests.

In Arizona, most of the candi-
dates for national office as well
as those for top state positions
endorsed by the Arizona Mine-
Mill Council won their nomina;
tions to face their opponent
party choices in the November
final.

Incumbent U. S. Senator Carl
Hayden won his renomination

race handily over a single op-.

ponent. Incumbent Democratic
Congressman Morris K; Udall
for the 2nd congressional dis-
trict,' although i running unop-

posed, still "topped-the-vote in

Mine-Mill counties. ‘ r
'. l ' ' us as -l«

GEORGE Duke Senner won

narrowly inca hard fought race
for Democratic nominee from

Arizona’s new congressional dis-

trict No. 3.

Key in Senner-’s contest against
two opponents was the support
of Mine-Mill Locals 886, 939, 586
and 616 in Gila and Greenlee
counties where he carried by
better than two to one against
his major opponent, State Sen.
Robert Prochnow.

The chief state race was won
by Sam Goddard, candidate for
governor, whose vote was well
over twice that of both his op-
ponents combined. Goddard car-
ried his campaign to the people

I

   
 

in a grass roots campaign dur-
ing which he appeared in all

Mine-Mill areas and at Labor’

Day picnics of the union in
Hayden and Superior.

Other Council-endorsed candi-
dates winning their state races
were: Wesley Bolin for secre-
tary of state; Wade Church for
attorney general; Jewell Jordan
for auditor; Milton Husky for
state treasurer; E. T. Williams
for corporation commissioner;
W. W. Dick for superintendent

as. District 5. The districts now
known as 3, 4 and 5 in the-mid-

now included in Districts 1, 2

‘TEXAS
Local 412

Extended negotiations by Lo-
cal 412 with the Texas Mining
and Smelting Division of Na-
tional Lead Company at Laredo
successfully broke through the
company’s dead-set p o s i ti o n

against any improvements in‘

the contract at all. Manage-
ment, in fact, had insisted on
a five cents an hour wage ‘cut
as well as contract language
changes which would hav
gutted the agreement. ‘

membership and‘ signed Sept.
12, the new two-year agreement
provides wage and fringe gains
including: general wage in-
crease of four cents an hour ret-
roactive to July 1; another four

new non-contributory p e n s i 0 11
plan.

committee, assisted by Int’l.

-EL PASO, Texas—A me_ss_age of fraternity from Mine-Mill to the organized
" 3 Workers of Mexico was delivered in person last month by Alfredo F. Ayala, President

' of El Paso Smelter Workers Local 509 and its representative on the AS&R.Counci1.

_ Ayala attended the national convention of the Confederacionde Trabajadores de Mexi-
- 0 co (Confederation of Mexican Workers) in Mexico City Aug. 30-Sept. 2. The CTM is

0' the main, labor federation

, in- Mexico. ~-
-As an invited guest speaker

before the convention’s 2,000

( delegates, Ayala shared the

spotlight with the President of
Mexico, ‘Adolfo Lopez Mateos,
to whom he had the‘ honor of

 ' being introduced.

His, attendance at the conven-

tion was by invitation of the

CTM leadership in Juarez, Chi-

’ huahua, Mexic 0 (E1 Paso’s

zsister border city), which had
formallygasked the El Paso
Mine-Mill locals to send dele-
gates. Ayala was sent with the
approval of the Local 509 mem-
bership.

ll!!!-ll

  convention was presided

over by CTM General Secretary

Fidel,Velasquez Who,‘ with other

officers and delegates from‘ all

over Mexico, gave Ayala a
' warm reception.

Invited to address the con-

/T vention on Aug. 31, the El Paso

local leader extended fraternal
greetings on behalf of Mine-Mill
members everywhere. His re-

marks received a tremendous
ovation and were given wide
coverage in the Mexican press.

After being introduced to the
convention’s top honored speak-
er, President Mateos, Ayala was

invited to hear the annual State.

of the Nation report given by
Mateos at the Zocalo, the Presi-
dential palace.

IN HIS report back to the El
Paso membership, Ayala said
the CTM convention grappled
with problems similar to those
discussed at Mine-Mill’s own
conventions, such as collective

bargaining, automation, political »

action and organization. Vari-
ous speakers stressed the need
for solidarity with unions in the
United States, he reported.

Later, Ayala was invited to
attend the Oath of Office cere-
monies for State Representa-
tives in the State of Chihuahua,
which took place at the State
Government Palace in Chihua-
hua City on Sept. 15.

While there, he was warmly

received by delegates from the
CTM, the Mexican Miners Union
and by outgoing Governor Bor-
unda as well as by incoming
Governor Giner.

Labor Day Events

Six Mine-Mill District 2 locals in Nevada and Arizona
last month reported Labor Day celebrations ranging from
simple family picnics to large joint affairs featuring
International Union officers as speakers and attended by

political- candidates in state primary races on hand for

a bit of grass roots poli-
ticking.

‘ Hundreds of unionists and
their families enjoyed a full day
of festivities centered at the
Ball Park in McGi1l, Nevada.

The celebration was sponsored
jointly by Mine-Mill Locals 233
in McGi1l and 124 in Ruth along
with other unions in the area in-
cluding the White Pine Central
Labor Council, the IBEW and
the Boilermakers. Mine-Mill In-
ternational Secretary-Treasurer
Irving Dichter was the featured
speaker.

A PARADE through down-

amounts of hot dogs and pop
were consumed. Included in the
program were children’s games
and contests, a rodeo in the af-

and wrestling matches at night.

Phony Stall “Fails to Halt
Macon Organizing Victory

MACON, Ga.——Workers at the unorganized Diversey Corp.
chemical plant here last month chose Mine-Mill as their bargain-
ing agent in face of a strong. anti-union attack by the company.

In the NLRB election Sept. 7, the vote wa-s 27 for Mine-Mill to
6 for no union, with three challenged and three voided. The 55
workers involved become a unit of Local 838. Regional Director

Jesse Doster led the campaign.

Starting its propaganda drive as soon as Mine-Mill filed the
election petition last April, the company moved to have the petition
dismissed on the phony ground that Mine-Mill was ineligible to use
the NLRB because of the SACB findings.

VALUE of the informative se-

was carefully analyzed and its
prices compared with other

Local 938 Business Agent Roy
Santa Cruz said: “As a result

of the first session we already
see a new attitude on the part
of‘ the miners here. The men
realize that they can’t possibly
get a fair return for their work
under the present company-im-
posed price system. They are
also seeing how they are de-
prived of even the little bit that

they have coming under Mag-
ma’s present set-up.”

He added: “The miners are
saying they are determined,
when the right time comes, to
wrest from the company a de-
cent bonus system. Our miners
now have a new s1ogan—‘Mag-
ma’s bonus prices are 20 years
too late and 20 dollars short.’ ”

THEIMINE-MILL UNION

Dichter Hits Copper Price Gouge, Cutbacks

OPPER MINE production cutbacks announced in July
by Anaconda in the United States and Chile, Phelps-
Dodge and Inspiration Copper in the United States, Rho-
desian Selection Trust-, Union Miniere-Katanga and Anglo
American Corporation in Africa and by Noranda in
Canada were followed by another round of cuts
early in September.

The second round of cuts was touched off by
Kennecott, which announced a reduction in
mine output in this country and in Chile of 10
percent. This was followed by a 7 percent
cutback by 0’okiep in South Africa, a
further cut by Phelps Dodge and, most re-
cently, by a 10 percent cut in copper produc-
tion by International Nickel in Canada. Al-
together, copper mine production in the non-
Communist countries has been cut by 17,226
tons per month below the average monthly
output for the first six months of this year of
304,600 tons. This figures to a cut of 5%» percent of the total.

The main job impact of the cuts announced so far has been the
scheduled layoff of about 1,150 workers at Kennecott’s Western divi-
sion, including 700 in Utah, 175 in Nevada, 140 in Arizona and 127
in New Mexico. Phelps Dodge has not announced any layoffs but
reduced days worked from 26 out of every 28 to 24 last July and
to 23 last month. This will be reflected in shorter paychecks for
Phelps Dodge workers.

Dichter

_***

OUR DAYS after Anaconda announced last July that it would

cut production, the Teamsters struck the Berkely pit in Butte.
‘Anaconda has not cut at other mines in the United States;
instead it has been letting the Teamsters sweat it out all summer
until the -settlement late. last month in Butte. There have been
no layoffs at Inspiration, where employment is expected to remain
steadyor to increase somewhat with expanding production at the
company’s new Christmas mine.

' 6What’s behind the sudden action of the world’s biggest copper
producers, at a time when, on the surface, the copper picture
looked rosy? The price at 31 cents a pound has held steady since
May, 1961, the largest period of copper price stability since the
close of World War 11. U. S. copper and brass mills in the first six
months of this year shipped record tonnages to customers.

Since early this spring, however, booming copper production in
the non-Communist countries has been running about 5 percent
ahead of copper consumption. Since it takes about 90 days to move
copper from the mine through the refinery, this excess production
didn’t begin to show up until last July, when producers stocks of
refined copper in this country and abroad took a big jump. Stocks

‘took another big jump in August and probably last month as well.

***

HE BIG copper companies could see this coming. They knew,

too, that brass mill inventories would go up during the slack
summer months, Brass mill sales in fact have been very slow
since the last of the labor contracts were finally buttoned up at
the nation’s major copper mines in July. Customers of the brass
mills have been reducing inventories built up prior to that time,
and have been content to letthe mills hold the inventories.

So labor is taking it in the neck at the country’s major com-
panies. Smaller mining companies like Duval, Calumet and Hecla,
White Pine, Pima, Cyprus, Bagdad, and others, are happy to stay
in full production as long as the 31-cent price umbrella is being
held for them by the big ‘producers. The big companies aren’t

hurting—as always, they shift the major burden of slack times-

onto labor. _
Does it have to be this way? We have it on the word of no less

an authority than the American Metal Market, daily newspaper of"

the metal industries, that it doesn’t.

*‘I(*

N-..AN EDITORIAL 16 months ago when the price of copper was
_ jacked up -to 31 cents a pound, the editors took the copper
industry _to task for short-sightedly grabbing for profits, at a time
when prices of competitive materials, other non-ferrous metals,
stainless steel, and plastics were going down in adrive to cut into
copper’s traditional markets. I . ' ' '
"The AMM editors put it this way: ; , . A - .. -
“Outrageous as the thought. may ‘be to traditional..-
copper producer thinking, the industry right now would 1
do well to be thinking of ways to cut the price of copper
- and its alloys. Such an intent, coupled with aggressive
promotion of copper uses, is what is needed to reform
the attitude toward copper as a material held by a wide
segment of U. S. industry. But the question must be
asked: Are producers and large custom smelters truly
interested in the tireless pursuit. of this kind of mar-
.keting philosophy?” , ; - — z 4

The editorial ‘pointed out that the former price of 29 cents a
pound had returned very healthy" profits for the big three producers
——$37 million for the first three months of 1961. “The biggest
producer, Kennecott,” said the editorial, “declared a first quarter
net of $16.2 million . . .. a healthy profit'when related to sales of
$117 million.  ’

V at , -ilz ‘A’

HE _P.RICE"leaders of the copper industry have held to the 31-
cent price in the face of furthercompetitive price reductions
since May, 1961, in aluminum,’ zinc, stainless steel anda wide range
of plastics. And,rather thantadjust to this competitive situation,

to maintain this price.  .

Call it what you will, the Copper Trust is more firmly -in control
of the copper market now than at any time in nearly 30 years.

Many benefits flow to the big producers from this situation.
All of them have brass mill and wire and cable manufacturing
subsidiaries. These manufacturing subsidiaries in the brass mill
industry serve as an outlet for copper ingots and other shapes, and
the big producers can make their profits in mining when compe-
tition gets rough in the fabricating end of the business.

Not so the smaller independent brass mills which have to buy
their copper at 31 cents and then find their profits badly squeezed.
Perhaps some of the smaller independent mills will go out of
business in the process.

**‘A'

HEN TIMES were better, the big producers’ copper fabricat-

ing subsidiaries conspired to fix prices of manufactured
copper products as well. Last month, six fabricating subsidiaries
and five of the stronger independent brass mills were indicted by
a federal grand jury in Hartford, Connecticut, for conspiring for
six years to fix prices of copper and brass tubing and pipe.

But for over a year now, the brass mill industry has been
competing vigorously to win business back from foreign mills which
moved in while U. S. brass mill prices_ were rigged. Quoted prices
have been reduced time after time, and under-the-table discounting
has become common. In the last year, it became a dog-eat-dog

situation, not only between U.vS. mills and their foreign competi-

tors, but among the U. S. mills themselves.
The big integrated companies don’t seem to care; they make
their profits on 31-cent copper and to hell with the independent

mills. _
Wk * ‘Ar

LL THIS may be fine and dandy, but it isn’t exactly the way

to win customers away from increasing use of competitive
metals and plastics, to increase the use of copper in this country
and abroad, and to keep copper miners on the job at the big -mines
in the West. The workers have nothing to say about these policies
-—they’re in the domain of management prerogatives.

What we can and must do is to shift this burden off labor’s
shoulders back to where it ought to rest, by fighting for the shorter
workweek with no loss in pay, for adequate severance pay, and
for an industry wide plan of supplemental unemployment benefits,

Then the companies would think twice before embarking on
a program of layoffs and short paychecks.——IRVING DICHTER.

Savannah Local Plays Active
Part in Georgia PrimcIry,Vote

SAVANNAH, Ga.-—Mine-Mill Local 870 played an active part in the Georgia pri-

mary Sept. 12 which saw every staunch segregationist defeated in the state contests.’ I

Of national significance was the hot race between former Gov. Marvin Griffin and
State Sen. Carl Sanders _for Democratic nominee for Governor, which means virtual

election in Georgia.

Griffin, a hard-core seg-
regationist, was supported
by the Klu Klux Klan and
groups‘ such as the White Citi-
zens Councils. Sanders, a “new
image” candidate, was en-
dorsed by all active Negro or-
ganizations including Chatham
County’s Crusade-for-Voters or-
ganization in which Local 870
functioned importantly.

ﬁlt Dlt bl!

WITH three other candidates
involved, the Governor’s race
was considered so close that
political analysts predicted its
outcome would necessitate a
run-off. The result proved them
wrong.

Sanders won by an avalanche
two to one vote.

Observers on the scene con-
cluded there was an obvious
trend in the outcome which saw
Sanders carry not only cities
such as Savannah, but many
small rural counties as well.

9? lit bl!

THE trend indicates that the
young White and the “New
Negro” are more and more
thinking along the same lines
on such political issues as bet-

‘ ter education and more secur-

ity.

Mine-Mill Local 870 leaders
and members are in the fore-
front of this trend in their own
community.

Their activity is important
in the Chatham County Cru-
sade-for-Voters which, in a spe-
cial Savannah election Aug. 28,
endorsed, a candi,date,,for inu-
nicipal judge Who Won over an

THE Crusade-for-Voters’ of-
fice is in the Local 870 Union
Hall, and Mine-Mill Regional
Director Jesse G. Doster is on
its executive Board.

Also very active on the Voters
organization’s Political Guid-
ance ‘Committee, which recom-
mends candidate endorsements,
are Local 870 President James
Edwards and Secretary Marie
Stevens. .

In addition, union members
are on every important com-
mittee of the various commu-
nity organizations.

ill in It

DURING the primary cam-

paign, the Voters organization
held a community-wide meeting
for candidates from Georgia’s
first district who were running
for seats in the State Assembly
and Senate.

Several of the candidates
pledged to sponsor legislation
to ‘repeal the state’s right-to-
work law and improve work-
men’s compensation and unem-
ployment insurance laws.

In the GoVernor’s race, Grif-
fin stumped the state warning
that the ‘Negroes were taking
over Georgia, playing up the
Albany de-segregation fight
and attempting to tie in San-
ders, his opponent, with the
Rev. Martin Luther King. San-
ders, on the other hand, made a
point of meeting with Negro
voter organizations as part of
his campaign. ,

The people turned out in big
crowds for Griffin and ate his
barbecue, but when they got
behind the polling booth curtain
they pulled the lever for San-
ders‘.

Sudbury Officers .
Election Delayed ' ‘
By Judge's Order_

SUDBURY, Ont.—Ontario Su-
preme Court Judge Fraser”
Sept. 11 issued an order pref»

venting the 17,000 members of -

Mine-Mill Local 598 here from
holding their executive board
election scheduled for Sept. 12.

The judge ordered ‘postpone-
ment of the local’s vote for
permanent officers until Oct. 8
“or thereabouts.” The action
before Judge Fraser was laid
by a so-called independent
group, but the main argument
for delay of the vote was made
by the attorney for Donald Gil-
lis, former Local 598 president
and candidate in the scheduled
election. .

Delay of the election just’ one
day before it was scheduled to
be held w a s ordered despite
the fact that Ontario Depart-
ment of Labor officials were al’-‘
ready in Sudbury to act as elec-
tion judges. The postponement
gives the Gillis forces more
time to campaign.

Meanwhile, Ontario Labor
Relations Board decisions were
still pending on two ‘Mine-Mill"
actions tovnullify the Steel raid
election held at International
Nickel Company last February.

Final Registration Dates

Final dates for registration in order to vote in the
Nov. 6 general election have already passed in eight
states where Mine-Mill members live-—A_rizona, Cali-

However, members in 16
other states still have the
opportunity to register between
now and Nov. 6 if they are not

INDUSTRY NOTES

WHERE DOES corpnn G0 after it leaves the refinery? In
recent years more than 95 percent of all refined copper produced-
primary and secondary—has gone to wire and brass mills for fab-

. rication. Minor amounts have been taken by chemical plants and

foundries.

From three-fourths to as much as 85 or 90 percent of the pro-
duction of brass and wire mills is used by manufacturers of liter-
ally tens of thousands of items—from electric toasters, bolts, nuts
and screws, and delicate scientific instruments to aircraft, locomo-
tives and automobiles and trucks.

These manufacturers used a .total of 1,133,734 tons of copper
wire and brass mill products in 1954 and 900,756 tons in 1958. Most
of the rest of the production of the wire and brass mills goes
directly to the construction industry or into transmission lines.

The Census of Manufacturers, published every four years, shows
in considerable detail the utilization of copper products in manufac-
turing industries. The latest census, for 1958, was finally published,
last summer. “‘

. Here is a summary from the censuses of 1954 and 1958, com-
piled by American Metal Market. It shows the approximate per-
centages of all copper wire, mill shapes and castings used in manu-

. facturing, by major industrial categories:

Approximate percentage ‘
‘of all copper products
used in manufacturing

Manufacturing industry group

1954 1958
Ordnance and accessories _______________________________ -- 6.9 2.5
Fabricated metal products _____________________________ __ 17.3 31.9
Machinery, except electrical ___________________________ -_ 14.1 13.3
Electrical equipment ...................................... __ 41.2 34.9
Transportation equipment _____________________________ -_ 11.8 12.6
Instruments and miscellaneous-._.-____---_--_.--_ 5.0 4.9

The industry groupings listed above each include manufac-
turers of thousands of individual items. Thus the fabricated metal
products group includes metal stampings, bolts, screws and
washers, screw machine products, hardware, metal doors, sash
and trim, hardware, hand tools, plumbing fixtures, cutlery and
many others.

Both 1954 and 1958 were depression years marked by slumps
in both industrial production and construction, and the patterns
of copper utilization may well have been different in better years.

The most significant thing the tabulation shows is the small
and declining role of the military as a consumer of copper. Ord-
nance and accessories took only 6.9 percent of all copper used in
manufacturing in 1954, and 2.5 percent in 1958. Tonnages used in
ordnance and accessories were only 78,878 in 1954 and a mere

22,693 in 1958--a decline of more than two-thirds in just four years.'"€

Manufacturers of military and civilian aircraft, aircraft engines

and aircraft equipment used only 12,126 tons of copper products in _

1954 and only 6,539 tons. in 1958. ~

The Federal Reserve Index shows an increase in production"

ofeaircraft and parts of 18 percent from 1954 to 1958, but between
these years, use of copper in making aircraft, engines and parts
dropped by nearly'50 percent.

Selby Worker Killed; Inquest

Reveals Company Negligence

SELBY, Calif.——Arthur Clarence Spencer, 35, a member of Carquinez Local No.
51 employed as a, painter at the Selby smelter of American Smelting and Refining Com-
pany, died August 1 as a result of head injuries suffered when he was crushed between
the cab of a moving crane and a vertical steel column.
A coroner’s inquest held at the request of Local 51 ten days after Spencer died

received voluminous testi-
mony filling 33 legal pages.
Attorney Bertram Edises was
retained by Local 51 for the
proceedings.

One witness, also a painter
at the smelter, testified that he
had refused to work under a
moving crane two weeks before
in the area where Spencer later
met his death and had been
threatened by the foreman with
a pink slip. This witness and

another painter testified they ‘

had never been instructed not

-to work under the moving
cranes.
..Another witness, an electri-

cian, testified that he reported

to a supervisor that he had

actually witnessed the accident.
15¢ iii #34

THE coroner at this point re-
marked that the Sheriff’s report
-had specifically reported that
there had been no eyewitnesses.

The evidence presented re-
sulted in a coroner’s verdict
that “Inasmuch as the testi-
mony in this case indicates
some degree of negligence it is
recommended that the California
S t a t e Industrial Commission

thoroughly investigate the cir-’
cumstances of this accident to .

determine: (1) if adequate safe-
ty rules were in effect; and (2)
if they were enforced.”

. An investigator from the’State
Division of Industrial Safety,
Kyle Lutz, came to the plant,
and was taken on a tour by

I 7 front-office management repre-

sentatives.

DESPITE the evidence, pre-
sented at the inquest, he did not
bother to interview any hourly
rated employees, including the
eyewitness to the accident, or
any officer of Local 51.

After strenuous protests to
the Director of the State De-
partment of Industrial Relations
by Local 51 and the Internation-
al Union, the investigator re-
turned to the plant, more than
a month after Spencer’s death,
to talk to the eyewitness, Broth-
er Jose Defrates, and to Robert
P. Kreis, Financial Secretary,
Local 51.

ONE member of the Division,

in a telephone interview with‘

Mine-Mill‘s Research Depart-
ment, did say, “It was pretty

obvious that things were not

right” at the plant.
Subsequently the Division
served a written “requirement”
on the company, citing the ac-
cident and requiring the com-

pany to “make positive provi- P

sions so that all cranes are

tive crane stops are installed

the crane movement would en-
danger men performing mainte-
nance work.”

Spencer leaves a widow and
three children, Sharon 6, Mary
Ann, 4 ‘years ‘and 8 months, and
Jo Ann, 5 months. .

A plant collection of.$278 was

taken up and delivered to Mrs. 1

Spencer by Local 51 President

Edward J. La Merrill and Fi-’

Mrs. Spencer has retained
Attorney David A. Dolgin, of
Condon and Dolgin, Martinez,
to represent the interests of the
family.

 

DENVER-—-A couple of issues back we ran a request for mem-
bers to advise us directly of changes of address. This is because
the Post Office has doubled its charge (from 5 to 10 cents) for
returning undelivered second, third and fourth class mail which
includes the Mine-Mill Union and all other labor papers.

The response of members advising us on address changes has
been quite good, and that encourages us to repeat this request for

even better returns.

We ask that you let us know not only if you have moved, but
also to give us your newvaddress if you plan to move soon. I

“ OISE has been rated by one authority as ‘the biggeist-sing-1

confronted with claims greater than those placed for silico

mated that amounts of claims filed throughout the nation forno‘
injuries were ‘well up in the billions of dollars.’ The qu_est1__o
confronting the mining industry is what to do about noise.” a
The above quote is the lead paragraph from an article —“-Hoyt
to Combat the Pending Noise Problem” in the September Engineer
ing and Mining Journal. ‘ . B _ . 
Equipment and operations cited as possible sources of exce_ss_ivje;_
noise include rock drills, pneumatic loaders and hoists, compressors;
impact crushers and rolls, rod and ball mills, riveting and chipping;
hammers, diesel and gas engines, high-speed electrical equipment"
and secondary blasting. "  ,  4
An editorial in the same issue concludes, “. . . the time
come when all industry, including our own, should survey its noise.-
problems and take steps to safeguard the hearing of employee
who are exposed to excessive noise of daniaging--frequencies».ove,
sustained periods. ~ , ,.;.
“Essential steps to launch a noise abatement and heirin
conservation program ‘are clearly indicated, and a number »-‘or;
mining companies have already established effective programs
These steps include: surveying plant and mine "with scientifi’
instruments to spot trouble zones; testing employee hearing wit,
audiometers; silencing, insulating or isolating noisy equipment Ta’
much as possible; issuing hearing protectors for employees who“,
work in excessively noisy areas. - . A -’ " _
“In some European countries there has been a divisionf.’o‘f-~
thought between various industries on whether to attack the noise-
problem decisively, or whether to soft-pedal the issue for fear that
it might stir up controversies on working conditions with labo"
unions- In Sweden the mining industry working cooperatively. W-itl
labor and equipment manufacturers has concluded that a:nois.ef}
problem does exist in mining, and therefore it should be attacked ..
intelligently and effectively.” ‘
