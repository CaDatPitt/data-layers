N.¥ Transit Strike Produces
Wage Gains of I5 Percent

NEW YORK CITY——In the face of a heavy barrage of unfavorable publicity from
the mass media and anti-union attacks by numerous politicians, and despite the jailing
of nine union leaders, the 36,000 transit workers of the nation’s largest city won a

stunning victory—for themselves and for the American labor movement—in their 13- 0

day strike at the beginning of last month.

Although there is disagreement on the value of the two-year contract package,
there can be no doubt but that the agreement cracks the 3.2 percent increase per year
set out in the government’s “Wage guidelines,”,and begins to bridge the gap in wages.

and working conditions that has

long existed between the transit ,

workers and those holding simi-
lar jobs elsewhere.

Michael J. Quill, fiery head of _

the Transport Workers Union,
who was jailed along with eight
other union leaders shortly after
the walkout began, took the’
brunt of the public attack, but it
was the 33,000 rank-and-file

" Transport Workers and the 3,000

members of the Amalgamated
Transit Union who decided to
strike and strongly supported
the walkout—the first such sub-
way strike in the TWU’s 31-year
history.

Solid Support

‘On Jan. 10, some 20 other
unions and the New York Cen-
tral Trades and Labor Council
of the AFL-CIO joined in a mass
demonstration at City -Hall, in-
dicating the broad labor support
given to the strike. Several days
earlier, in a telegram to Quill,
Mine-Mi1l’s international officers
pledged the union’s support to
the strike. “You are conduct-
ing,” said the message signed
by President A. C. Skinner,
Vice-President Asbury Howard,
and Secretary-Treasurer Irving

' Dichter, “an extremely impor-

tant battle for and in behalf of
the entire labor movement. Our
members are proud of you and
your union.”

The settlement, which was

reached in the early morning
hours of Jan. 13, provides’ for a.
15 percent pay _raise over the
two years——an immediate four
percent hike, a similar increase

on Jan. 1, 1967, and a seven
percent increase on July 1, 1967.

The new contract, -too, guar-
antees payment by the New
York Transit Authority for ex-
pected increases in health and
welfare charges and says that
from now on the Authority will
provide the uniforms for bus
drivers and conductors, which
in the past have been purchased
by the workers themselves.

Additional Gains
Improved working conditions,

such as an additional holiday
and other benefits to be decided
upon, will cost the -Transit Au-.
thority $1 million this year and

$2 million in 1967. - -
The contract also gives transit ;

workers an additioinal $500 a
year if they retire during the

contract period, in addition to.

their regular city pension.

Hearings

Safety Bills Delayed

WASHINGTON, D._C.-——No date has yet been set,
as this issue of the Mine-Mill Union goes to press, for
Senate hearings on federal mine safety legislation. The .
Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on .
Labor and Public Welfare is expected to consider three
proposals on the subject at such, hearings — the bill
passed by the House of Representatives last year, the
original version of the Johnson administration pro-
posal, and the Metcalf-Montoya bill.

The current filibuster attempting to prevent a
Senate vote on the House-passed bill to repeal Section
14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act is one reason for the
delay on the mine safety hearings. Minority Leader
Everett Dirksen (R.-Ill.) , leader of the filibuster forces,
has said that he will not allow interruptions of the “de-1 '
bate” to permit any other business to be transacted.
Sen. Pat McNamara (D.-Mich.), who normally chairs
the Subcommittee on Labor, is one of the leaders in
the fight for repeal-—the top priority of the American
labor movement in this Congress. .

on Mine

Pressure Persists   

On Price of Copper    

January was another month of fast-breaking developments in,

copper.

Kennecott, the only big U. S. producer to "report by Mine-Mill.

Union press time, said its 1965 after-tax profits hit $101,895,130-—.  

the third highest figure in the company’s history, and up from»

$66,098,279 in 1964. The big jump in profits was due mainly to , .
higher copper prices. Kennecott sold its copper for almost _4 cents _. _ p 
per pound more last year than in 1964. ‘ ‘ ‘ ’ - '

issue.

slumped last November when
President Johnson released 200,-
000 tons of copper from the
national s to c k pile, recovered
and were pushing to newhighs
at the end of January. Copper in
London hit 84% cents ‘per pound,
and was quoted at between 60
and 70 cents in‘New York. U. S.
refiners and secondary smelters
were offering 48 cents per poimd
for No. 2 copper wire scrap.

Fabricators‘ Layoffs

Some fabricators of copper re-
fused to buy the metal at in-
flated dealer prices and were
forced to lay workers off. Cerro
Corporation furloughed ,70O em-
ployees at its St. Louis tube’ mill
because of “the economic im-
possibility of obtaining dealer

copper and scrap materials at
levels near those , that j, would
~p,er'rnit, ‘break-even o7_re1‘atio_n.” . V

Profits of other U. S. companies will be reported in the next

. about 0500 workers because the I

price of non-producer c o p p; e r

“has just been completely out ,

of reach as far as our opera.-

Aive in Arizona

PHOENIX, Ariz.—-The federal
Voting Rights Act of 1965, which
is being challenged by South
Carolina and other deep South
states, was attacked last month
from another quarter. Darrell
Smith, the attorney general of
Arizona, announced plans to file
a suit seeking to» block enforce-
ment of the new law in three
counties of the state.

In August, the U.S. Justice
Department ordered an end to

’English and literacy tests in

Apache, Navajo, and Coconino
counties, where the voter reg-
istration was less than 50 per-
cent of the voting age popula-
tion. The Voting Rights Act
uses this formula to establish
patterns of discrimination.
Each of the three Arizona
counties has a "large Indian
population, and the attorneys
for the three counties argued
that the federal government
action did not take into. account
the large number of non-Eng-
lish-speaking Indians on federal
reservations.
Fancy That!
Their statement charged that
many of the Indians have little
education and declared that
they could not be prosecuted
for election fraud or any other
crimes under state law. They
might, the statement also noted,

be able to outvote the whites.

The- U. S. Supreme Court is
expected soon to rule on the
constitutionality of the Voting
Rights Act in the case initiate
by South Carolina. . ‘

Superior Local Wins
TwoArbitration Cases

SUPERIOR, Ariz.—Five-day disciplinary layoffs last year by
the Magma Copper Company of Gilbert Montijo and Oscar Ward,
two members of Mine-Mill Local 938 here, have been found to be
unjustified. Both men received payment for wages lost during the
suspensions as the result of two separate arbitration awards.

Montijo was suspended on July 29 for “insubordination,” having
allegedly failed to carry out the orders -of a supervisor. Arbitrator
Dr. Vernon D. Keeler, however, who held a hearing on the case on
Nov. 19, ruled that the company had failed to sustain the charge.

Pointing to the importance of presuming innocence until guilt
is conclusively proven, Dr. Keeler noted that “it was not clearly
shown that he (Montijo) was even responsible for receiving and
carrying out direct procedural
orders, as this was the task of La 30113, Ca1if- handed d0Wﬁ

WANT TO CONGRATULATE the Transport Workers
of New York and their leadership, in and out of jail,
on the enormous victory they scored in the recent strike
against the New York Transit Authority. Anyone who-
has ever ridden the New York subways and busses must
realize how rough and nerve-racking these jobs are.
Wages paid New York transport workers are low—— low
in terms of the workers’ needs in a high cost-of-living
area like New York and low in comparison with what
other city workers doing similar jobs were getting.
There was no question as to the justice of their
cause. The New York Times, which vehemently opposed
the strike, had to admit to “a vast heritage of wage
inequities that required adjustment.”

Sitting out West, I had the feeling that the Trans-
port Workers Union victory was a victory for all of labor.
The hysterical headlines had to be taken with a grain of
salt. Sure the strike caused hardships. But all strikes
inevitably create hardships — first among the strikers
themselves and secondly among those who are dependent,
on either the strikers’ services or their dollars. But no
union or its members strike for the fun of it. Usually
there is no other way left to correct a “vast heritage of
wage inequities” or any other kind of inequities.

*‘k'k

HE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFAC-
TURERS and the Chamber of Commerce cry to
high heaven in any important strike. They’re always
ready with information on the
amount of money lost in wages
and to business and with the
“arrogant labor, disregard of pub-
lic welfare” pitch. And, if the
strike is big enough, it always
endangers something.

It was therefore quite a shock
to pick up The Denver Post of
January 18 and see the headline,
“Reuther Deplores N.Y. Strike.”
Walter Reuther can’t be held re-
sponsible for a headline. But the
story went on to say that he
opposes “public service strikes”
and quotes him as saying, “Society cannot tolerate the
strikes that endanger the very survival of society.”

1\'**

IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE for anyone in the
labor movement to throw rocks at the New York
transit workers. But even_ to suggest that this strike
endangered the very survival of society” is hysterical
nonsense. It seems to me, ten days after the strike -is
over, that our society has survived intact. New York
is_ back to normal with its dirty slums and ghettoes,
with its foul polluted air, with its overcrowded and
understaffed transit system, with its tens of thousands
of unemployed. '
Walter Reuther can be misquoted and misinter-
preted. I hope in this instance he was.

Review of Convention's Pension Proposals

‘ E HAVE JUST PASSED the mid-point in -our
_ three-year agreements with the major companies-
in our industry. I know a great many of our ‘members
feel we have another year and a half to go before we be-
gin the next round. But that. isn’t so. Both the ASARCO
and Inspiration pension plans expire this coming July 1,
and the February international executive board meeting
will open the discussion on our 1966-67 pension proposals.
Just to refresh everyone’s memory, here are the
highlights of our convention resolution on pensions:
1) An increase in the basic benefit amount to
$5.50 per month per year of service, plus a cost-of-
living adjustment.

2) Supplemental pension benefits for early
retirees until they are eligible for full Social Security
retirement.

3) Early retirement after 15 years with no
actuarial discount if retirement is due to plant or
department shutdown, automation, or disability of
the employee.

4) Vesting of pensions after ten years and
freezing of _ pension credits for employees laid off
for lack of work.

5) Widow’s pensions.

6) Disability pension, at increased benefit
amounts, after 10 years, with elimination of Social
Security offset.

7) Union participation in determination of
adequacy of pension funding and the interpretatio
of the pension plan. 1

8) Compulsory retirement at age 65.

9) Accumulation of credits to be on a com-
pany-wide basis. , i

10) Pension plans to run concurrently with our
bargaining. agreements. - ‘

THE MINE-MILL UNION

‘Labor for Metcalf Committee’ Formed;
Montana Senator Target of Right Wing

HELENA, Mont.—Members of the Montana Mine-Mill Legislative Committee met
here on Jan. 8 with representatives of other unions throughout the state to begin co-
ordination of the activities of organized labor in the forthcoming campaign for the
U. S. Senate seat that is up for grabs this year. _

The some 60 persons in attendance voted to establish the “Labor for Metcalf
Committee,” agreeing that the incumbent Democrat. “has a proven record not only in
behalf of labor, but all people, regardless of their affiliations.” The group, too, ex-
pressed the sentiment that Montana owes it to people throughout the nation to re-

elect Senator Lee Metcalf.

Jim Murry of Laurel, .a member of the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers
Union, was elected president of the new “Labor for Metcalf Committee.” Barney Rask
of Butte, Mine-‘Mill executive board member, was named vice-president. Other officers
are Ed Johnson of Anaconda, a state legislator from that town and a member of the
United Steelworkers, secretary, and Henry Burger of Missoula, a member of the Team-

sters Union, treasurer.

Robert C. Weller of Kalispell, the Lumber and Sawmill Workers District Council
secretary, chaired the meeting during the formative stages of the organization.

The group will meet again
here on Feb. 12, at’ which time
more formal campaign strategy
may be discussed.

Metcalf, one of the Senate
sponsors of the Metcalf-Mom
toya miner safety bill for the
non-ferrous In e t a l s industry,
hearings on which soon "will be
held by the Subcommittee on
Labor, has demonstrated during
his first term in the upper house
of Congress both willingness and
ability to fight effectively for
progressive social legislation. A
Senator‘ with wide-ranging inter-
ests and concerns, he has a
strong grasp of a wide variety
of legislative issues.-

‘Mr. Education‘

He has been tagged “Mr. Ed-
ucation,” for example, by Sen.
Wayne Morse (Dem.-Oregon).
Although not a member of the
committee which last year

-drafted the breakthrough bill
providing federal aid to public
schools, Metcalf became such
an expert on the nation’s edu-
cational problems that he was
invited by committee members
to counsel with them on the
proposal. Fittingly, Metcalf’s
signature—on behalf of the Sen-
ate—appears on the official bill
along with President Johnson’s
and House Speaker John -Mc-
Cormack’s.

A few of his legislative battles
have done nothing to endear
him to some of the biggest and
most powerful financialinterests
in his home state. His proposal
for a very strong federal mine
safety bill is bitterly opposed by
the Anaconda Company, while
his fight for stricter regulation
of the utilities companies has

Two ASARCO Workers

HAYDEN, ARIZ.—An arbitra-
tion award handed down in
early January by Thomas T.
Roberts of Rolling Hills, Calif.

‘ reclassified Guillermo Chavez
and Lorenzo Verdugo, both
members of Mine-Mill Local 886
here, as shop helpers first class
and provided each with approx-
imately $440 in back pay.

. The original grievance in the
case dated back to Jan. 7, 1965,

' and the back‘ pay for each man
amounted to the differential be-

‘ -tween the shop helper’s rate and

the wage scale for shop helper
first class—$1.68 per day—over
a period of just under one year.

The two men, who had been
classified as shop helpers, ac-
tually» have been performing for
that length of. time work which
should fall into the higher rated
category, the arbitrator ruled.
Chavez, ‘who works in the pipe
shop at the American Smelting
and Refining Company plant,
threads, measures, and cuts
pipe, is required to know all

types of fittings and va1ves,’cuts'

gaskets, and occasionally per-
forms soldering and braising.
Verdugo, who has, worked in
' the converter and the roaster de-
partments, has been required to
perform simple layouts, make

measurements, tack, weld, cut’

and burn, maintain and repair
cranes, and do a variety of
types of. repair -work.

An earlier award, dated May
26, 1965, had rejected the com-
pany’s contention that the union

- grievance was not subject to

arbitration.

ment between company and
union and in ‘the next four years
six employees were promoted to
that position, since 1962 no me-
chanical department workers
had held that classification.

_ Local 886 argued that the recent

refusal of AS&R to classify em-
ployees as shop helpers first
class was in violation of the con-
tract. Shop helpers first class
receive.$23.76 a day, compared
to $22.08 for the shop helper
classification.

Pointing out that management
on occasion has issued orders
that shop helpers are to do no
cutting, burning, welding or

tacking, the arbitrator main-
tained, “It is not enough to
simply issue the order but

thereaftgr gondone the assign-
ment 0 work in such a fashion
that duties of the higher-rated

job are demanded.” -

Eight other workers involved
in the case were found by Rob-'
" erts to-be properly classified as
shop helpers.

antagonized the Montana Power
Company to no little degree.

A special report in a recent
issue of the International Wood-
worker, published in Portland,
Ore., also notes that Metcalf
will be one of the chief targets
of the extreme right wing in the
1966 campaign. And the Montana
Democrat is well aware of this.

“Watch out for the right wing-
ers in the 1966 elections,” he has
recently said, “they’re organ-
ized, --they’re well-heeled, and
they’re out for blood.”

Pointing out that the John
Birch Society alone -— only one
right wing group among many
-—-is gunning for a $12 million
political war chest this year and
is organizing in 325 Congres-
sional districts," Metcalf ex-

plained his concern that the»

rightists “weren’t even fazed by
the defeat they suffered at the
polls in 1964.”

Precinct Organization

“They got to work the day
after the election,” said Metcalf,
“in Montana and elsewhere in
the nation. They started apply-
ing a vital lesson they learned
from the 1964 election: Sound
and fury are no substitute for
solid, well-planned organization.
Since then, they’ve burrowed
right down to the precinct level
to organize—-and they’re doing
a good job of it. Anyone who’s
familiar with politics knows
that’s where elections are won-
at the precinct level.”

Maintaining that one reason
for the growth of the right wing
is that “they have managed to
appropriate the word ‘conserva-

tive’ for themselves,” Metcalf

declared, “They are not true
conservatives. Conservatism has
an honorable and responsible
tradition in our country. While I
may not agree with it, I respect
it. Conservatism is cautious, but
not destructive‘. The right wing
is destructive, and anything but
cautious.” ‘

“I see no hint,” he continued,"

“of responsible thought or action
in ' demands to impeach Chief
Justice Earl Warren, to wreck
the United Nations, to repeal the

income tax, to hurl nuclear
bombs around, to rob people of
their civil rights and civil lib-
erties, to label legitimate dissent
treasonous and anyone who dis-
sents a communist.”

“It’s a curious thing,” he said,
“but every program that’s de-
signed to help people is tagged
as ‘socialistic’ or ‘communistic’
by the extremists,” pointing to
such programs as Social Secur-
ity, medicare, minimum wage
and unemployment compensa-
tion laws, school aid, housing,
civil rights.

Despite the belting that the
right wing took at the polls in
1964, however, the circulation of
right wing publications has in-
creased. Post office figures
show that Human Events was up

eight percent in each of the last

two’ years to a present circula-
tion of 123,434; National Review
up 13 percent in 1964 and 18 per-
cent last year to a total of
86,273; American Opinion, a
John Birch Society publication,
up 39 percent in 1965.

(Editor’s Note: The following editorial is reprinted from u.

After 13 days of a strike which all but paralyzed Newe 7

nation, the Transport Workers Union has walkad away from -
the bargaining table with a two-year package variously esti-
mated as ranging from $52 million to $75 million. There are p .
34,000 subway and bus workers, so the settlement averages; ‘

Transit Authority before the strike, and the offer on the first 
day of the walkout was not more than half what it was 131-‘ 5- :>

Throughout the strike, Mike Quill, president of the TWU,
was portrayed in all news media as a buffoon whose silliness 
was only exceeded by his arrogance. If New Yorkers had .

Quill was confined, it seemed, they would have lynched him._« _
Young Mayor Lindsay, who emerged from the fracas as just- » 1

ga committeeman,

maintained
that the words Moreton had
used on July 2 were ones com-
monly used by both workers
and foremen. The referee
agreed that Moreton’s language
was in common usage in fac-
tories’ and ‘apparently had in-
sulted no one. '

In throwing out the “miscon-
duct” charge, he ordered the
retroactive payment of unem-
ployment insurance benefits.

Married and with four chil-
dren, Moreton worked for the
company for about eight weeks
prior to his discharge—just a
few days short of acquiring
seniority rights under the union
contract. Local 593, neverthe-
less, is continuing to press the
company for. his reinstatement
on the job.

been ill for five months.

On Sunday, Jan. 16, the International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen’s Union held a memorial meeting at its North

. Point Street hall for Andersen,. a member of the law firm of Glad-

stein, Andersen, Leonard, and Sibbett—-a firm which has repre-

sented the ILWU and most of

its Bay Area locals virtually

since the union’s initial or-
ganization.

Born in Denmark of Ameri-
can parents, he was raised in
San Francisco, attending high
school here. During World War
I, he went to work as a boiler-
maker and became a member
of Boilermakers Local 6. He
later undertook the study of law
and opened his own office in
1927. .

He rose to prominence as a
labor lawyer when the old Inter-
national Labor Defense sent
him to San Jose in late 1933 to
defend pickets arrested in a
cannery strike. Over the years,
he defended, in addition to long-
shoremen, a wide variety of
different kinds of workers—sea-
men, peach pickers, and, in the
late 1930’s, members of Mine-
Mill in Nevada City, Calif. He
also represented Mine-Mill in
numerous arbitration cases.

Gold Miners Attacked

In the spring of 1938, striking
gold miners in Nevada City and
in neighboring mining camps
were threatened‘ and beaten by
vigilante mobs and deputized
gunmen, who also ransacked
and severely damaged the union
hall. A Governor's Commission
of Inquiry_int0 the raids later
substantiated the miners’
charges that law and order
broke down, that the Nevada
City authorities were prejudiced
against the CIO, that strikers

were attacked and injured, some

severely, and ‘forcibly escorted
out of the county.

Andersen, together with Atty.

Herbert Resner, filed damage»
suits on behalf of the miners,
charging vigilante and mining-

‘company management violation

 

of several constitutional and
statutory guarantees of civil
liberties and the right to or-
ganize. Although anti-union sen-
timent was being fanned by
company officials, the miners
that summer showed their con-
tempt for such intimidation by
voting overwhelmingly to have
the Twin Cities Miners Union
283 negotiate renewal of their
contract.

Sets Precedent

Threatened with death and:
once shot in the shoulder during
his long legal career, Andersen,-
in taking the Marysville anti-
picketing ordinance to the Su-
preme Court of California, was
the first to_ get such a local
ordinance declared unconstitu-
tional in the middle 1930’s.

A devoted civil libertarian, he
also represented witnesses called
to testify by the House Un-
American Activities Committee
—-an institution long opposed by
Mine-Mill and other labor
unions because of its smear
tactics and disregard for judi-

cial practices.

Mine-Mill Council in Arizona

ms Mm:-Mm. Union :

PursuesLegislative Programs

. PHOENIX, Ariz.—A program for state legislative action, drafted at a Jan. 8 meeting of the Ari-
zona Mine-Mill Council, was pursued later in the month in separate meetings with the full Labor
Committee of the House of Representatives, the Industrial Commission of Arizona, and State Senate
President Clarence Carpenter of Gila County. '

The council’s legislative committee, named by the council officers at a meeting on Jan. 14, also

-has been working to coordinate the Mine-Mill efforts toward getting bills introduced with those of

the AFL-CIO, whose state president is John Evans. Mine-Mill and the AFL-CIO have parallel legis-

lative programs.

On Jan. 20, Mine-Mill Council Chairman Roy Santa Cruz, Jr., Committeeman David Duarte, and
International Representative Sylvain Schnaittacher presented to the House Labor Committee, chaired

by James E. Shelley, the union’s
legislative program, stressing
the need for establishment of a
state safety code to cover all
plants not now under the juris-
diction of the state mine inspec-
tor, needed improvements in the
present Industrial Disease Act,
and a state minimum wage to
cover all workers including
those in agriculture.

Rep. Chris T. Johnson of
Phoenix offered to work with the
union in preparing and intro-
ducing.proposed changes in the
Industrial Disease Act, includ-

o ing increased benefits and the

loosening of eligibility require-

I‘ ments for silicosis benefits.

The Mine-Mill delegation which
met with the Industrial Com-
mission discussed possible
changes in commission rules re-
garding multiple injuries and a
change that would pay on dis-.

" ability under reopened claims

from the first day of disability
rather than from the date of
filing. The Industrial Commis-
sion, which is comprised of John
Ahearne, a recent appointee of
Gov. Sam Goddard, chairman,
Lawrence Huerta, and Frank G.
Murphy, asked that the proposed

 language for the rule changes
be submitted. This will be done.

The meeting with Sen. Carpen-
ter ‘took place. on Jan. 19, and,

' in addition, the Mine-Mill group
A - discussed its
, many other senators and repre

program with

sentatives. —

Sales Tax Repeal
Another item on the list of

the union’s state legislative pro- -

posals is repeal of the state
sales taxes on food and prescrip-
tion drugs. Petitions, calling for

.-such action to be submitted to
-the governor and the legisla-

ture, are now being circulated

not only within "the Mine-Mill
;. _- -_loc-als,‘but by seve‘ral"other or-
 ganizations as well.
,  -  Other-legislative’ proposals are
 to give the attorney general the

Says M-M CounciI ,

PHOENIX, Ariz.—-A five-point program of support
for some 3,500 farm workers on strike against the grape
growers in the Deleno, Calif. area was enthusiastic__allyf_
adopted by the Arizona Mine-Mill Council here on. Jan. 8

Recognizing the importance of the campaign for‘col:-
lective bargaining rights for the California ﬁeld Workers,’-'
the delegates passed a resolution calling upon the." Mine
Mill locals and the labor movement in general in Ariz
to carry out the following actions! , I I V  y 

0 Contribute funds to the strikers, who have_ been. 'out..‘sinc,e_,
last September. Send donations to the National Farm ‘Work’-_,
ers Association, P. 0. Box 894, Delano, California." . "

0 Inform their membership not to buy Schenley liquors;
use the grapes from the Delano area. .  '- -_ 1, 

O Distribute bulletins to the public in their respectivegconi
munities on the Schenley boycott. . “ “ 

0 Request stores in those communities not to

. products.

0 Join in efforts to prevent importation of scab labor into..-the
strike area, whether from other states or foreign ,countries.’.-

‘ The council voted a $100 contribution to the NFWA,‘ andffan,
additional $84 was collected on an individual basis from-'1? the

delegates.

Mrs. Dolores Huerta, a vice-
president of the NFWA, who has
spent the past bouple of years
organizing the field workers, ad-
dressed the meeting on the ef-
fectiveness ofthe strike and on

some of the problems encoun-_

tered.
‘Two Groups Cooperate

- ~Besides the ‘National Farm .
. Workers Organization, the AFL-

CIO’s Agricultural Workers Or-,,
ganizing -Committee is involved. __

The two groups, primarily com-
prised‘ of ‘Mexican-Americans
and Filipinos, are ‘cooperating
closely with one. another. Cesar

Chavez heads the NFWA, while ‘

C. Al Green is director of the
AWOC. ‘ ‘
Strikers are demanding an
hourly wage, of $1.40--the mini-
mum rate that must be offered
to domestic workers by growers
asking for braceros—plus an in-_

centive rate of 25 cents a box.’

THE MINE-MILL UNION

. change in the complexion of the New Jersey legislature that took place in the November election last year, when

""L.f.Gov_. - Richard J. Hughes, a

"Democrat, was returned to of‘-

 fi'ce*'b'y a large margin.

Although one of the most

'1  heavily industrialized states in

‘the nation, New Jersey had

 ‘-— been’ dominated politically by
 .-the rural conservative interests.
_, -- The. fact that one. state senator

was elected from each county,

‘i_:”}.’,1*egardless of its population,

_~._plu's'the gerrymandering of the

"various districts had produced

a basically conservative legisla-
ture, even in years when Frank-
lin D...Roosevelt and other Dem-

  ocratic presidential candidates

'_-won landslide victories in the
state.
 Continued Republican control
of the legislature had produced,
,too, the caucus rule, under

  _'“-.-which public hearings on pro-

proposals. Already, Mine-Mill

, __j"posed legislation became prac-
_, j_'tically unknown in the state of ‘
 ‘New Jersey. Under this rule,

‘through which the Republican

  ,5.-ma-jority in the Senate made all

important decisions in secret

 ,'c’au_cus,‘ no labor proposals or

-o t he r -progressive legislation
' ever reached the floor for dis-

 " cussion.
-  -' ‘ The "undemocratic nature of
‘:1 -the caucus rule becomes appar-
,‘e'nt,w_hen one considers that a
5"/'fmere"six senators, ‘a majority
_  of the 11 Republicans of the to-

est Mine-Mill locals in the state

i—John Infusino of Local 365 in

Perth Amboy and Thomas De-
Federico of Local 837 in Car-
teret—-together with other New
Jersey I a b o r representatives
met with state assemblymen
and senators from the industrial
areas.
Maior Goals

Among the major legislative
goals of the labor movement in
New Jersey are revision of the
state’s workmen’s compensation
and unemployment compensa-
tion laws,‘ enactment of a $2 an
hour minimum wage, double-
time pay for overtime work,

RIEI-l’PPORTION1VIENT'I1‘l NEW IEHSEY has brought about an extremely favorable change

and the strengthening of anti-
discrimination laws covering all
facets of life.

Proposed changes in the work-
men’s compensation law would
increase benefits from the pres-
ent maximum of $45 a week to
two-thirds of a worker’s normal
wages, raise the maximum
death benefit for funeral ex-
penses from $450 to $1,000,
establish a maximum of 450
weeks instead of 350 with re-
spect to compensation paid to
widows and with respect to
physically and mentally defici-
ent dependents, eliminate the
waiting period, and provide to
employees a free choice of phy-
sician in the event of injury.

A real fight is expected to be
made to provide. unemployment
compensation to strikers after
a six—weeks waiting period and
to locked-out workers immedi-
ately. Labor,‘ too, will push to

raise the benefits to two-thirds
of the employee’s normal week-
ly wage and to liberalize eligi-
bility rules.

Mine-Mill’s complete legisla-
tive program has been circu-
lated to the union’s membership
throughout the state and the
locals are being mobilized for
political action.

Seven of the 60 state assem-
blymen come directly from or-
ganized labor. Maurice V. Bra-
dy (Dem.-Hudson Co.)- the
speaker of the Assembly, is a
member of the Printers Union.
One of the state senators, too,
is a labor man.

It is generally agreed that la-
bor has a great opportunity this
year to push effectively for pro-
gressive legislation. Mine-Mill,
aware that such an opportunity
must not be passed up, undoubt-
edly will be present in force
during this session at Trenton.

For Effective Legislative Action in NJ.

1  ]'..._;TRENTON, N. J .——Both houses of the state legislature that convened here on Jan. 11 are controlled, for the
’  first time since 1913, by the Democratic party, which in last fall’s election campaign pledged itself to a program that
 " _would substantially improve the state’s labor law. As a result, Mine-Mill, with 11 local unions in New Jersey, this
 year-is looking for passage of the most meaningful legislation in the state’s recent history and has been making
  ‘preparations for its most strenuous period of legislative and political action in many years to aid in the enactment
 of such legislation. ,

The Labor Scene
. $900,000 Court Settlement for UAW

When the Studebaker Corporation closed its South Bend, In-
diana plant in 1963, 3,000 retired UAW members were left holding
an empty bag so far as health and life insurance were concerned.
The company claimed that their coverage should run only until
the expiration of the then current contract, in October, 1964. UAW
brought suit and, in January of this year, the federal court in South
Bend approved a $900,000 settlement to cover health and life in-
surance until the retired workers are eligible for medicare at age
65. The company says most of the workers will be eligible by next

June.

faculty members, including nuns and priests, at St. John’s Uni-

world. Strikers are members of the United Federation of College
Teachers, an AFL-CIO affiliate. The dispute hinges on the abrupt
dismissal of 31 faculty members without any hearing. Behind the
dismissals is a long drawn -out controversy over participation of
the faculty in matters of policy and function of the university.

summer received one week’s
vacation pay, each gotan ad-
ditional week’s pay as the result
of an arbitration award handed

Although both workers had
been employed by the company
for more than three years at
thebeginning of the vacation
shutdown on July 16, Chicago
Foundry maintained that the
May 31 cutoff date established
for computing the- number of
hours worked by an employee
during the preceding year,
which is one factor in determin-
ing the amount of vacation pay
due, should also be the date for
determining the worker’s‘ peri-

Our hats are off to Local 392 of the Mine-Mill Union.-. ’

One of the very best projects that ever has come to the school-
through the Volunteer Service has been the help we have received
from our friends from the Magna, Utah area.

Mr. Ellis Burrellstarted--the ball rolling in our direction almost 0

a year ago, and we have been receiving a great deal of -help and

consideration since that time.
Other activities have been re-
ported to the Mine-Mill. Union,
and all have- been appreciated.
However, the activities by .-Local
392 during this Christmas season

son had been employed by the
company for two years, 11
months, and three weeks; Wash-
ington for two years, 11 months,

and twoand a half weeks. The .

company treated -both workers
as though they had only.on.e
year of service in computing
their vacation pay. . .

Nov. 1 Hearing

David B. Rothstein servedas '

the attorney for Mine-Mill Lo-
cal 758 at the Nov. 1 hearing on

the case. Also appearing on be-._

half of the union were James
Pinta, business agent for the
local, and James Lee Harris,
Nathan Sharpe, and William
Garrett, three Local 758 stew-
ards.

The union contended that, un-
der terms of the contract, An-
derson and Washington had
completed three years of ser-

0, vice at the time of the 1965 va-

cation period and »were- thus
entitled to receive 80 hours of
vacation pay rather than the

40 hours. that they got. It was;

pointed out that prior -to 1961
the “Vacation” provisions of
the contract had contained a
cutoff date applying to both
hours of work in the previous
year and years of service -with
the company, but that the
clause had been amended and
substantially changed in .1961.
In -granting an extra week’s
vacation pay to the ‘two men,
Arbitrator Luskin agreed that
the date when vacation begins,
and not the May 31 date, should

‘be used in determining an em-

p1oyee’s seniority withthe com-
pany.

Copyright 1966 by Consumers Union of U.S.. lnc.. Mount Vernon. N.Y.

Too Much Vitamin D?

There is mounting medical evidence that too much vitamin D
may produce infantile hypercalcemia, a disease that results when
the metabolism of calcium goes wild. In its severe form hyper-
calcemia is characterized by mental retardation and heart defect,
together with changes in the facial structure that characteristically
result in a prominent forehead and protruding upper lip. This ab-
normality apparently can result from consumption of too much
vitamin D by either the victim’s mother during pregnancy or the
infant himself after birth.

This warning is carried in a story in the February, 1966 issue
of CONSUMER REPORTS which discusses the U. S. Food and
Drug Administration's proposals that vitamin D fortification be
permitted only in milk and infant formula products and prohibited
in all other foods. The FDA’s medical committees and the Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association

\:‘ made the recommendations on which the proposed limitations are

based.
“ The practice of fortifying milk with 400 U.S.P. units per quart

 of vitamin D would continue to be encouraged by FDA, and 400

U.S.P. units would remain the recommended daily dietary allow-
ance for children, pregnant women and nursing mothers. Multi-
vitamin pills would also be allowed to contain this amount (many
now contain far more), but their labels would have to bear this
warning. “Unless prescribed by a physician, the product should
not be used to supplement diet in excess of 400 U.S.P. units of
vitamin D from all sources.” .

The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has set up a
committee of doctors, lawyers, and research scientists to study the
FDA’s proposals. The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation,

’ which licenses the process. for adding vitamin D to foods, is re-

ported by THE NEW YORK TIMES to have denied that there is
“. . . any proof whatsoever that vitamin D is harmful to anyone.”

CU applauds the safety—first approach of FDA. It is to be hoped
that a further airing of the matter will establish not just how much
vitamin D is too much, but also how much is actually needed for

_ nutritional purposes.

Dishwasher Detergents

r U Don't End Spotting

I The February issue‘ of CONSUMER REPORTS which carries
the results of tests of eight brands of dishwasher detergent includes
this comment:

‘  CU’s tests beliejl one of the more common claims made for

 such detergents——that they end water spotting. Occasional spotting
 ioccurred even with the soft water used, regardless of what deter-

gent was used. A better way to prevent spotting, CU found was to
use a rinse conditioner in the final rinse. CU cautions that dish-

, washer detergents are for machine use only and should be kept

[away from the skin and particularly from mucus membranes or

7 _ "eyes—and children.

, CU found no significant differences in washing ability of the
brands tested but did find that some were more harmful than
others to china with an overglaze pattern.

1 Coffee Companies Drop
 --‘Cents-off’ Pricing Practice

_ WASHINGTON, D. C. —Sen.
. ~ Philip Hart’s “truth in packag-
Ving”'bill, designed to eliminate
' deceptive practices in listing
weights and prices on retail food
products, is one of the holdover
items that the 89th Congress is
J .. expected to deal with in its sec-
' ~ _ ond session this year. President
_ -Johnson referred to the Michi-
Egan Demo-crat’s proposal in his

According to a special report

to The Tacoma News Tribune"

by Washington correspondent
A. Robert Smith, the coffee
companies’ retreat from the

, “cents-off” pricing is due to a

simple query to the Federal

Trade Commission by Sen. War- .

ren G. Magnuson (D.-Wash.),
chairman of the Senate Com-
merce Committee. In basically
asking the FTC how it is polic-
ing deceptive practices, reports
Smith, Magnuson raised a dozen
such pointed questions as: How
is the FTC exercising its" au-
thority over deception in the
food and drug field? How preva-
lent and how significant are de-
ceptive practices in American
commerce today. ~

While Magnuson has yet to

‘receive answers to these ques-

tions, the FTC reportedly recog-
nized that it was not doing
enough in this field and as a
result took aim at the “cents-
off” pricing practice. Prior to
any action by the FTC, how-
ever, the coffee companies said
they were dropping the practice.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

Picture of Viet Nam Situation

President Lyndon Johnson, proposing in his State of the Union message a $112.8
billion budget for the next fiscal year, maintained that the United States could con-
tinue to build “The Great Society” at home While pursuing the war in Viet Nam. Yet
it is increasingly obvious that Republican Congressmen will be joined by some mem-
bers of the President’s own party in attacking domestic spending this year if the war
and its tremendous costs continue to mount.

As this issue of the Mine-Mill Union goes to press, the administration apparently
has reached no decision on when the bombing of North Viet Nam might be resumed.
It has indicated, however, that the resumption could not be postponed indefinitely.

With the administration's peace offensive now more than a month old, the Viet
Nam issue continues to dominate the news and the private conversations and public

statements of Congressmen.
While many favor an immediate
resumption of bombing in the
North as well as a blockade of
the port of Haiphong, others
favor a continuation and in-

tensification of peace. efforts-

Seventy-six Democratic Con-
gressmen, for example, in a let-
ter to the President late in
January, urged a halt or re-
versal of the military escala-
tion in Viet Nam and asked
President Johnson to formally
request the United Nations to
seek an effective cease-fire
there.

35-Day World Tour

Pointing up the “difficult and
painful choices” confronting the
administration on Viet Nam, as
the behind - the - scenes debate
continues, is the Jan. 6 Mans-
field Reportto the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee. En-
titled “The Viet Nam Conﬂict:
The Substance and the Shadow,”
the report is the result of a 35-
day world tour late last year
by a fact-finding committee of
five Senators—Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.), Dan-
iel. K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), Ed-
mund S. Muskie (D-Maine),

  

Sen. Mike Mansfield
Majority Leader

George D. Aiken (R-Vt.), and
J. Caleb Boggs (R-Del.).

The grim conclusion of the
report -is that the present situa-
tion appears to offer “only the
very slim prospect of a just
settlement by negotiations or
the alternative prospect of a
continuance of the conflict in

Romania, the Soviet Union,

More U. S. Troops

Maintaining that the large
scale introduction of U. S. forces
in Viet Nam “has blunted but
not turned back the drive of
the Viet Cong,” the group stated
it is doubtful that the “con-
stricted position now held in
Viet Nam by the Saigon govern-
ment” can be held indefinitely,
let alone extended, without addi-
tional American ground troops.
The report declares that no sig-
nificant change has taken place
during the past year in the con-
trol held by the Saigon govern-
ment and the Viet Cong over
different sections of the country.

Other sobering facts contained

in the Mansfield Report are .

these:

0 The Saigon government can-
not be expected to carry
much more of the load than
it is at the present.
Assistance from nations
other than the U. S. is, with
few exceptions, not likely to
be forthcoming.

. The sources for expanded
recruitment by the govern-
ment in South Viet Nam are
not great, while a high de-
sertion rate from the army
continues.

“Total Viet Cong strength,
apparently, is steadily in-
creasing,” both from local
recruitment in the South
and infiltration from the
North.

nings of the rumblings of
personal discontent and an-
tagonism which generally
characterize the reaction in
any nation to the sudden in-
fusion of a large body of
foreign forces.”

0 While Hanoi is exposed to
air attack, some believe that
Saigon’s vulnerability to
sabotage make the two cities

“mutual hostages, one for

the other.” ’

The report contends that “the '
basic concept of present Amer- 

ican policy with respect to Viet
Nam” is the role of support of
the Vietnamese government and
people, yet states that “This
concept becomes more difficult
to maintain as the military par-
ticipation of the U. S. undergoes

' rapid increase.” Yet, if the con-

cept is eroded, the report says,

the war will be drained of a

purpose with meaning to the

people of Viet Nam, producing

a “most unfortunate impact-
upon the Vietnamese people and‘

the world at large.”

Stating that the Viet Cong 

have responded to the increased
American role with a further
strengthening of theirforces, the -.

report maintainsthat as long as ; ‘ '

the North Vietnamese and their

. supporters “are willing and able.-

“There are also the begin- _

to meet increased force by in‘-' ‘P ’

creased force,” American pres-

sure is. being applied to a mili-  — ‘C:

tary situation that is “open
ended.” Pointing out that the
war has already expanded into
Laos and is beginning to Spill"-

‘over the Cambodian border,.the

World's Biggest Cage

The Braden Copper ‘Co., Kennecott’s Chilean subsidiary, will

soon install what is said to be the world’s largest cage in a 1,300-
foot shaft at the El Teniente mine. The triple deck cage, as big as a
-two-story house, weighs 30 tons and can carry up to 250 miners or
37tons of freight. The bottom‘ deck is 12 feet wide, 30 feet long, and
1-2. feet high. With doors on all four sides, it can be loaded or un-
loaded: in four different directions at the same time. The cage will
jrhang. from six 11/2-inch wire cables, and will have a hoisting speed
 600 feet per minute. Miners enter the Braden mine at 8,000 feet
above sea level and are hoisted upward to workings at higher levels.

Western Coal Mining Boom

The six western coal mining states, producing less than five
percent of the U. S. total output of coal, are on the verge of‘ a big
expansion. Coal production in the six states jumped by 50 percent
between 1959 and 1964, but industry sources look for an even
sharper increase in the future.

An area of vast coal reserves, the western states have been
held‘ back by remoteness from large coal markets. Now, however,
with reduced transportation costs, big eastern coal producers are
buying up coal reserves, opening up new mines, and giving com-
petitive fuels--natural gas and residual oil-——a run for their money

%..wlthi such large consumers as the public utility companies.

Coal Company of West Virginia, which has bought control of a

Developments in Chile
_ Some 10,000 workers have been on strike since Jan. 1 at Braden
‘Copper Company’s El Teniente mine in Chile. Braden is Kenne-
’cott’s'-Chilean subsidiary. When the old contract expired on Dec. 31,
the copper miners were demanding a 100 percent increase in
wages, while the company offered 25 percent. After the strike
began the workers’ demands were lowered to 70 percent and the
company came up with‘ an offer of about 31 percent.
» Neither side has moved from its position, and negotiations
Vwere recessed on Jan. 12. El Teniente minenormally produces
over 160,000 tons of copper per year;
Three top officials of the Chilean Copper Workers Confedera-
.tion were thrown in jail last November during the 36-day strike
against. Kennecott and Anaconda mines in Chile. They were re-
wleasedjas part of the general settlement that ended the strike,
 labeled_.“illegal and politically motivated” by Chilean President
 .~:-._',Eduardo Frei.. Late in December, -however, the Chilean Appeals

Anaconda Maps Expansion

Anaconda is in the news withannouncement recently of expan-
sion plans on several fronts:

0 Richard Stewart, president of Anaconda} American Brass,
said‘last month his company planned to-spend $34 million on expan-
sion of plant size and capacity at all of the company’s locations.
Some of‘ the expenditures will carry over into 1967.

O Anaconda Iron Ore (Ontario) Ltd., a 90-percent owned sub-
sidiary of Anaconda, will go ahead with long-deferred plans to mine
ore from its deposits at Skibi Lake near. Nakina, Ontario, north of
Lake Superior. Concentrates will be transported by Pipeline from
the mine site to a pelletizing plant at Kama Bay on the north shore
of Lake Superior, from where pellets" with 67 to 68 percent iron
content would be shipped to steel mills on the lower Great Lakes.

0 The Great Falls, Montana copper refinery was scheduled to
increase its capacity last month by 2.5, million pounds, to 30 million
pounds per month.

10 The company’s new 42,000 ton per day concentrator in Butte
will have by 1967 a new multimillion dollar addition—a separate
section of the present’ plant——which will provide improved recovery
of acid soluble copper.

La Oroya—-12,000 feet up in the Peruvian Andes. Nearby are the
company’s five mines, producing copper, silver, lead, zinc, bismuth
and other metals, and its smelter. .

Word comes from Australia that Pickands Mather & Company

welfare gains in addition to gen-
eral wage increases and re-
classifications.

About 60 workers are em-
ployed at the plant and will re-
ceive across-the-board w a g e
hikes of four, four, and five
cents per hour during the three
years of the contract. Classifica-

tion adjustments on various jobs-~~~ 

range from three to 10 cents per
hour.

The improved health and wel-
fare plan covers the full cost of
hospital room and board (semi-
private room) and of hospital
services and incidentals; up to
$300 on surgical costs; and, on
doctors’ fees while in the hospi-
tal, $10 for the first day and 69
additional days at $3 each.

Shift differentials were in-
creased to six and nine cents
for the second and third shifts
respectively.

Additional contract changes
provide that a worker will be

\paid at time-and-a-half for a

sixth consecutive day of work
and at double-time for a seventh
consecutive day. A worker’s reg-
ular schedule shall not be
changed to avoid the payment
of overtime.

Holidays, whether or not
worked, will count as a day
worked in the computation of
overtime. The work week will
in the future begin at 7 a.m. on
Monday instead of on Thursday.

, Four officials of the U. S. Public Health Service report‘in Archives of Dermatology for May,

‘ 1965 an outbreak of arsenical skin disease affecting residents and workers in a mining camp in 1963.
The camp is not identified by the authors. The followingis quoted from their report: ’

“The dermatological problem arose at a gold mine a.nd smelter (more likely a roaster-Ed.)

which had engaged in intermittent mining and milling of gold. and tungsten since 1934. Late in 1962,

' R. gold mining and milling were reinstituted with about 100 men being employed in the operation. The
adjoining camp community housed about 60 families, numbering’ between 200 and 250 residents.

“A few months after operations began, several of the children who were attending the elemen-

tary school in the camp community began to develop skin lesions, mostly on the exposed parts of

. the body. The State Department .
’_oflHealth was suspicious that»,
the gold smelting operations
were causing community ex-
posure to arsenic, and that the
- dermatoses ‘were possibly re-,
lated to this exposure. They

about 40 of the children, the-n

so that subsequent cyanidation

“During a typical day’s opera-

and 100 tons of sulfur dioxide
were burned off by the smelter.
The dust collecting system,

- though intended to trap about

90 percent of all toxic dusts, had
failed to operate at the expected
efficiency. ,

“Thus, on several occasions,

sulfur dioxide in plainly visible

quantities w e r e discharged

Company Must Bargain
On Safety. Rules NLRB

In 1964, ‘Gulf Power Company,
a Florida public utility, refused
to bargain withthe International

Brotherhood of Electrical Work-.

ers on safety provisions in a
new contract “on the ground
that safety was the exclusive
.responsibility” of the company
and therefore not a “bargainable

issue,” as the National Labor’

Relations Board put it.

The Board’s_ r e c e nt ruling ,

says in part, “We find,that in
requesting negotiations o v e r

safety rules, the union was ‘seek-

ing to -bargain over a subject
matter within the meaning of
the phrase ‘other terms and con-
ditions of employment’ ” in the
National Labor Relations Act.
“We find that safety provisions
constitute an essential part of
the employees’ terms and con-
ditions of employment and as
suchare a mandatory subject of
bargaining.” R

the camp site were affected
similarly, whereas the high
school children who commuted
by bus to a distant school and
were away at least 10 to 12
hours a day were free of lesions.

“Eighteen mill workers on the
day shift were examined, and
about half of them had lesions
similar to those seen among the
school children. In addition, two
of the mill workers had ulcera-
tions and perforation of the na-
sal septum, a well-known clini-
cal effect produced by contact
with arsenic.” _

=14 >3 >3

“A systematic survey of the"
- animal population was not under-

taken, but, according to several
of the residents, the dog and cat
population (more than a dozen)
had been all but eliminatedby
illness. .A collie doggseemed to

be the lone survivor. He was

located and ‘found to have a
large ulceration on his mouth
and another on his right fore-
paw. ' ,

“Temporary closure of the
mill, followed {by a change in
wind direction, some snow and

- rainfall, and finally, improved

environmental controls, resulted
in a marked clinical improve-
ment of the arsenical derma-
toses within a periodof three
weeks.”

Reading‘ the above report, it
is evident that, with a payroll of
about 100 employees, this .,.was
no fly.-by-night operation. It’s
obvious that the state mine in-
spector, or- whoever may have
been chargedpby the state with

industrial’ safety, was grossly

negligent, to say the least, in

-permitting‘ the operation of a‘

roaster with_faulty dust collec-
tion equipment to endanger the
health and safety, not only of
employees, but ' of women and
children‘ living in the -camp.

‘ This incident has come to light
only because the federal govern-

ment was called in to get attire-

cause of the outbreak afterithe
state health authorities asked
for competent help. How many
more cases of this kind have

to happen before passage of a,

federal mine safety law applic-
able as well to mills, smelters,

and refineries?
