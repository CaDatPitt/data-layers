MUCH is being said about the Constitution of
the United States of America. Nothing is
said about my Constitution. Yet my Constitu-
tion is by .far the most important, for it is the
Constitution of every man, woman, and child on
the earth. .

The Constitution of the United States of
America was written a century and a. half ago.

My Constitution was written millions of
years ago.

The Constitution of the United States of
America, we are told, is the greatest document
ever conceived by the mind of mortal man.

My Constitution was promulgated by the All
Father who sowed the stars into space, separated
light and darkness, land and water, and breathed
life into dead forms.

The Constitution of the U. S. A. is written on

' paper.

-My Constitution is written in every bone,
muscle, blood corpuscle, nerve and cell in my
body.

' My Constitution demands three meals a day,
a bed to sleep in and clothing to keep it warm.

The approved way in which I satisfy the de-
mands of my Constitution is by turning the raw
materials of nature into things useful to me and
my -Constitution.

I work with soil, sunshine and rain, to feed
and shelter my body.

I work with wind, water, and fire, to shape
my tools.

I am nature and life.

I am cause and effect.

I am purpose and means.

I am the child of creation, creating.

I am born. I mate and beget and return to
earth in accordance with eternal law.

The Constitution of the U. S. A. says nothing
about soil, sunshine, and rain; says nothing
about wind, ﬁre, and water; says nothing about
food, clothing, and shelter; says nothing about
the tools of my trade; says nothing about birth,
mating, and death. Begotten by the puny mind
of mortal man, it knows not the might of Na-
ture.

What a queer thing this Constitution of the

. United States! After declaring the protection of

 

life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness the
purpose of government, the Constitution delivers
life into the hands of property!

Nature knows nothing about property. It
sheds its bounties in return for my labor. Yet
under the Constitution I am denied access to
Mother Nature and the tools of my calling un-
less I possess an admission ticket called title
deed.

The Constitution gives me the right to speak,
write, and vote. It denies me the God-given
right to work and eat unless I am the possessor
of soil and tools.

Propertyless, I only can earn the wherewithal
of my being at the suffrance of property. .

Propertyless, I have neither the right to toil,
beg, or steal. Under this queer Constitution, I
am free to do anything but to satisfy the de-
mands of my Constitution either honestly or dis-
honestly.

The other day the custodians of the Constitu-
tion of the United States said property cannot be
taken, no matter how great the suﬁering of mi]-
lions. It said, though hunger devour your very
entrails, these millions of idle acres are not for
you to raise food for yourself and brood. It said
these thousands of silent factories ﬁlled with the
iron slaves of science are not to create shoes for
your bare feet, clothing for your naked back,
roofs for your homeless heads. And though the
woe of you and your kin may drive you to crime
and suicide, they cannot be used by you, for they

are property and property is king-—now and for-

ever, amen.

Ah, there's the rub. If I were property, the
Constitution of the United States would protect
me as it protects ass, ox, bull and bank account.
But alas, I am not property. My body is not
property. The strength of my arms, the skill of
my ﬁngers, the cunning of my brain is not prop-
erty. It is only life. And life may be taken
without due process of law by simply depriving
it of access to soil and tools. So they drive life
off of land for non-payment of taxes or interest.
They drive it out of mine, factory, store and
oﬂfice, whenever their owners decide there is no
more proﬁt in human life.

husbandmen seek food in’ garbage cans.
Idle mine mules munch hay in warm stables.

lIdle miners hunger in chilly shacks. Fathers

pound the bricks in search of honest toil. Sons
roam the highways, mooching hand-outs. Daugh-

 ters walk the streets selling‘ ﬂesh for clothes.

Breasts dry up. Babies starve. Mothers weep in
their sleep. Who cares? The Constitution of the
United States is not for them.

War comesn I am dragged from home and

C . loved ones. My body collects lice, rheumatism,

pneumonia in stinking trenches. The light of my
eyes is switched off by ﬂying pebbles and iron

 splinters. My ear drums are burst by detonation

of murder machines. My lungs are drenched in
poison gas. My entrails mix with dirt and gore.
My jaws are gone, my legs blown off. I am a
festering carcass in a man-made hell hole.

All this is very hard on my Constitution, but
in full accord with the Constitution of the United
States, for under it property is all and life is
nothing. Yet my Constitution will prevail in
spite of dungeon, faggots, gallows, and Supreme
Court decisions. My Constitution laughs at all
of them. And such is the humor of its belly
laugh that it shakes down thrones, altars, char-
ters and constitutions.

The nine old gentlemen in Washington heard
the distant rumble of that belly laugh, dipped
steel goose quills in black ﬂuid and solemnly
wrote-—“Desist! Thou art unconstitutional!”

What a ghastly farce! My Constitution un-
constitutional? My Constitution put to shame
the decrees of princes, popes and kings. My Con-
stitution swept into the rubbish chamber of his-
tory institutions declared eternal by mortals
claiming authority from God Himself.

My Constitution unconstitutional, is it? I am
to live and perpetuate life only with the consent
of property? I am to be cast aside like a broken
saw blade whenever property has no more use for
me? Don’t make me laugh, gentlemen. The belly
laugh of my Constitution shook down Babylon,
Tyre, Athens and Rome, and it will bury you, for

._ my Constitution is life eternal.
