I \\\\  .

sooner or later ﬁnd out the truth of what Hiss called Whittaker Chamb-
ers’ “forgery by typewriter.” The “secrets” Hiss was supposed to be
“stealing” could not have the slightest value to the Soviet Union or
any other power, despite the solemn statements to the contrary.

Take the “sensational” testimony of Elizabeth Bentley, another Mc-
Carthyite informer helping to build up the myth of “Soviet spy rings.”

Miss Bentley proudly informs the McCarthyite committee that cer-
tain New Dealer “spies” had created the Morgenthau Plan to de-
industrialize Germany because that was in “Russia’s interest.”

But the Soviet Union was strongly on record against the Morgen-
thau Plan from the very beginning.

It is only the political illiteracy of the McCarthyites, and their de-
sire to manufacture a myth, which led the Jenner Report to make this
“sensational” disclosure which is false on its very face!

Other specimens of the “enormous damage” done by “communist
inﬁltration” are cited by the McCarthyite Jenner Committee. They
reveal only the Big Business Toryism of the men making these revie-
lations. Here are some of the alleged atrocities committed by the “spies”
as cited or quoted by the ]enner=rCommittee: '

o “The report was a favorable recommendation on a highly con-
troversial health program.” Thus, suppprt for a Federal health plan,
long advocated by labor and many doctors, was “espionage.”

Another witness, telling about the “spies,” relates with horror that
the “spies” in the National Labor Relations Board clashed with her
View that “the Wagner Act had to be administered in a way to recog-
nize the implicit rights of employers, too. . . .”

In short, this witness was trying to go beyond the Wagner Act
to favor the employers and found that the “spies” were pro-labor
and would not let her do it! »

Another witness reveals that one of the “spies” was “devising ways

and means of having Israel Epstein’s book, The Unﬁnished Revolu-

tion in China, read by Secretary of State George Marshall, John Foster ,

Dulles, and other leading policy makers of our government.”
Thus, the purchase of an American book became “espionage.”

The Real T arget—;Democracy

A study of the McCarthyite strategy reveals one main fact about
10

 

it. It is enraged by the fact that the Roosevelt Government, for at
least those few years, would not discard’ the democratic rules of evi-
dence, proof, on which justice is based. The Jenner-McCarthyites de-
mand that when it comes to “communists”——-and this means every
one they choose to name as such—the traditional rules of proof, legal-
ity, and evidence must not apply.

0 Thus, the Jenner-McCarthyites are astounded when a top Gov-
ernment oﬂicial, John McCloy, Assistant Secretary of War during the
Roosevelt administration, said: “Many persons suspected of advocat-
ing subversive doctrines . . . were loyally supporting the war eﬁort.”

How did this oﬂicial dare to challenge the McCarthy “inﬁltration”.

lie with this fact? What have facts to do with f‘ﬁghting communism”?

0 Even worse, another Government oﬂicial enraged the McCarthy-
ites by citing the Supreme Court’s decision that there was “confu-
sion”——meaning no proof—that the Communists advocated force and
violence. What did the McCarthyites care if a pre-McCarthy Supreme
Court could not ﬁnd any facts showing force and violence by the
Communists?

0 A so-called “atom spy” list manufactured by a stoolpigeon in a
'Canadian Soviet embassy was so fraudulent when considered in the light
of evidence that. not even the eager agents of the Truman “cold
war” could makesa single indictment on the basis of it. Yet, it is just
this .“naive” reliance on evidence and proof which McCarthy now

‘ cites as proof of the need for a “clean-lup.” America must have rulers

who will not be bound by evidence, who will be ready to replace
evidence by myth! A

Since‘ the FBI could never ﬁnd any evidence for the “force and
violence,” the “spy” and “foreign agent” lies about the Communists,
these lies are legislated into law, and Smith Act juries jail innocent
men and women by the score to uphold the myth by which the nation
must be terrorized into silence.  ‘

Scream headlines announce that McCarthy has uncovered a “Com-
munist” in the Government Printing Olﬁce who had “access to secrets.”

_ He was seen to be “stealing a Marine Code Book.” In the feverish

excitement, McCarthy even hints that “H-Bomb Secrets May Have
Been Involved.’’ ' A

But the cold facts turn out to be very different. It turns out that
there never was a “Marine Code Book,” and that there never were

11

  

any “secrets” printed in that ofﬁce.’ (Washington Post, statement by
Philip Cole, August 22, 1953).
But what enraged McCarthy in this case—and it shows what he is

V after—-is that the government office would not ﬁre the smeared victim,

even though there was no evidence of any kind against him!

McCarthy wanted him ﬁred simply because %he had been
accused! A .

The use of this stable of McCarthyite stoolpigeons and informers
(Budenz, Bentley, Whittaker Chambers, etc.), to create the Mo-
Carthyite myth of “New-Deal-Soviet spy rings,” has caused great dam-
age to American political freedom and to the U.S. Constitution.

It has caused the conservative columnists, Stewart and Joseph
Alsop, to say in their syndicated column (Jan. 16, 1953) that the Attor-
ney General “must investigate the professional informers who now
flourish in,this country if he cares anything at all for American liber-
ties.” ~

It is realized that if a Budenz can wreck top oﬁicials’ careers with
palpable lies, the “professional informer” makes the liberties guaran-
teed by the Constitution a mockery. V

But what gave a Budenz his power as a “professional informer” if
not the Truman government’s use of him as their mainstay in the

frame-up of the Communist Party leaders in the notorious Judge

Medina “trial”? _

It is a threat to freedom that the Eisenhower leadership eagerly
uses this same stable of FBI stoolpigeons for new and bigger Smith Act
frame-ups. t

Eisenhower’s attorney general, Herbert Brownell, has upheld Mc-
Carthy’s money dealings with corporations seeking political inﬂuence
from Senate committees of which he was a member. Eisenhower has
appointed two open McCarthy agents to the powerful Federal Commu-
nication Commission where they can dominate radio and TV. This is
a sinister cooperation with McCarthyite fascism for which the Ameri-
can people surely did not vote in 1952! '

If a Budenz can frame Communists and the Communist
Party with impunity, why should he not be available to frame
a Lattimore, an Alsop, or a C.I.O. or A. F. of L. leader, or any-
one else displeasing to the McCarthyites? ,

McCarthyism carefully uses this stable of professional informers

to break down the U.S. Constitution. A

Thus, it implies that any American who refuses to surrender his
traditional rights, under the First and Fifth Amendments, to the
privacy and inviolahility of his political belief, must be “guilty of
something." This is the logic of the Spanish Inquisition probing
heresies. The press sneers at such patriotic Americans as “Fifth Amend-
ment Americans.” Why not sneer at “First Amendment Americans”
or “Thirteenth-Fourteenth Amendment Americans”? 01' “Constitu-
tion Americans”?

The United Electrical Workers Union well describes this kind of
political frame-up trap: “The way it works is that a Budenz goes before
the Committee and says that someone is a Communist, a spy, a sabo-
teur. Then John Doe is called before the Committee. If he denies the
charges, he is cited for perjury. I f, to avoid this trap, he refuses to
speak, he is cited for contempt. Either way the witness loses.” (Op-
eration Intimidation, page 28).

The Political Platform of McCarthyism

What are the tests for “loyalty” and “security”. which the Mc-
Carthyite stoolpigeons cite?  _

Despite all the frenzied headlines, it is never any action, deed, any
actual illegality. It is always the charge that the “spy” has certain

‘political ideas different from those of McCarthyism.

Thus, McCarthyism launches the following ideas as absolutely
sacred and un-debatable: ‘

Atomic war with Russia is inevitable and good. War with China
is ditto. Spanish fascism and German fascism are the only “reliable”
allies we have, and we must re-arm the old fascist Axis. Chiang Kai-
shek must he helped to attack China with American guns, and later
with manpower. There must be no negotiations of any kind withpthe
Soviet Union, China or the Pople’s Democracies looking to peace or
Soviet Union, China or the People’s Democracies looking to peace or

This is the political platform of McCarthyism which this
cabal is trying to force on the United States under the guise
of ﬁghting “communist inﬁltration in government.” It is an
out-and-out war policy! It is a policy dangerously hostile, to
the true national interests of the United States!

to accept thieving taxes on wages and salaries, the wrecking of schools,
F oderal power systems, etc.——a1l in the name McCarthy’s “inevitable war
with communism.” McCarthyism smashes freedom in order to force
social decay on the United States!

For this “McCarthy line” ﬂies desperately and insanely in the face-

of all modern realities.

--It ﬂies in the face of the realities of the Asian colonial revolution
which sees fully one-third of the human race rising up to achieve
national independence and economic progress.

—-It ﬂies in the face of the refusal of the West European majority
to re-arm German fascism for “another try” in the Hitler style.

-——It ﬂies in the face of the military realities of the atomic and
H-bomb situation. Atomic “superiority” is now impossible.

—-It ﬂies in the face of America’s economic advantage which is to
o-pen up the colossal markets of the 800,000,000 people living under So-
cialist leadership.

Since most Americans consider themselves today as “anti-Commu-
nist,” McCarthyism makes “anti-Communism” the cover for this war-
breeding conspiracy. V" T  ;,

But it is McCarthy himself who debunks the illusion that “anti-
Communism” is the cause he pursues, and that thereforehe can claim
the support of the entire country which is also “anti-Communist.”

“Do not be deceived,” he cries to his future Storm Troopers,
“by any general condemnation or tossing of pebbles at Communism
generally. That is a perfectly safe sport indulged in even by Alger
H iss. The test is not whether they are willing to condemn Commu-
nism generally. The test is whether they follow a pattern of supporting
or condemning the exposure of the sacred cows—the dangerous under-
cover Communists who have been promoted to positions of untouch-
ability by the Communist and left-wing press.” (The Fight For Amer-
ica, by Joseph McCarthy, page 90.)

There is not a single American, leader or average citizen, who can-
not be clubbed down in Storm Trooper fashion by the use of this “test.”

To pass this “test” requires from all Americans complete, whole-
sale, and continuous submission to McCarthyism’s demands on every
issue, every personality, and all the time! ,

Does not this raise for the growing, courageous, patriotic anti-Mc-

Carthy resistance movement the sharp question of its relations to the
“anti-Communist” Big Lie which so many of its groups and followers
still blindly accept? a

An! anti-McCarthy newspaper deplores his “methods,” but admits
that “Congress has the right to probe who is disloyal and who is not.”

But that is exactly what Congress does not have the right to do,
if the First Amendment is to have the slightest practical meaning!
For “loyalty,” so deﬁned, is not a legal concept, except under tyran-
nies. It is a political one, and political ideas must be allowed to clash
in the market place of ideas for the people freely to choose!

Others often say that so-and-so was falsely “accused” of being

’a «Communist. This is true in many cases. But can the frame-up be

effectively fought if the McCarthyite assumption that it is a crime to be
a Communist is not challenged head-on? ’

Every criticism of any aspect of McCarthyism is valuable for
America. But the defense of democratic liberty will be partial and un-
successful in the end, if the non-Communist majority leaves in Mc-

_ Carthyism’s hands its major weapon——the Big Lie about the nature,

aims and practice of Marxism and Communism. »

This does not in any sense whateveqmean that to ﬁght McCa.rth
one must take it stand of agreement with the outloolc or hphiloso " y
of working class Socialism. On the contrary, the anti-McCarthy move-
ment, to save American democracy, must inevitably be a movement
in which the Communistsare a small minority, since the present ‘ma-
jority is non-Communist or even anti-Communist (as they understand
Communism) . ‘

But the non-Communism, or even» “anti-Communism,” of the anti-
McCarthy movement must insist on the democratic rights of the Com-
munists within the movement, and within the country! i .

The heart of the McCarthy conspiracy is to rob the American na-
tion of its right to debate alternative policie_s,“to choose a social and
economic path different from that advocated by the biggest Wall Street
trusts. It replaces debate with the “spy” myth. This it becomes
“treason” to challenge. ,

Democracy must rout the McCarthy lie that to support democratic
freedoms for Marxists, or to agree with proposals for American-Soviet
negotiations, constitutes “subversion” and “disloyalty.”

Otherwise democracy will not win.

How to Fight McCarthyism

How to ﬁght McCarthyism?

0 Let u-s throw McCarthy’s Fifth Column out of the camp of de-
mocracy——the Fifth Column of his Big Lie about “spies” in the New
Deal and progressive movement. ,

0 Let us realize, too, that McCarthyism is not just the person of .

McCarthy; that it is a social drive for fascist reaction and war. This

push also comes from within the Billion Dollar Cabinet of the Eisen- '

hower Administration, though the Eisenhower Administration and Mc-
Carthyism are not the same—yet. McCarthyism acts as a pressure on
the government to toe the McCarthy line, and to soften the country
for the no-negotiations stand of the Eisenhower administration.

0 Let us realize that McCarthyism is not just a smear or an un-
proved charge. It is embodied in a series of police-state laws now being
enforced by the Eisenhower Administration. These laws are the
Smith Act, the McCarran “Concentration Camp” Act and the McCar-
ran-Walter Act. ’

Every “loyalty” oath, every fear-ridden dismissal of a pa-
tribt who will. not “cooperate”. with the McCarthyites, every
Siiiith Act fraine-up, every political deportation,‘ is McCarthy-
ism in action. . _

0 Finally, let us realize that McCarthyism withers in an atmosphere
of peace, of Big Power negotiations, of trade with the 800,000,000
people of China and the Socialist lands. The swamp of “spy” manias
dries up under the sun of world peace and world trade.

America did not take “the'German path” in the 1930’s. It is not
fated to take that path in the l950’s. It is true that the war-hungry
industrialists fear democracy. They fear a democratic-labor program
to protect the nation from the effects of economic crisis. They fear
peaceful co-existence with the Socialist countries, and they fear colonial
revolutions in Asia.

But need our country fear these things?

No! A Great Decision faces our country———peace or war? Social ad-
vance or McCarthyite fascism? There is no doubt where the will of the
people lies. Against McCarthyite fear—-courage and unity of
action! ~

McCARTHYISM AND THE BIG LIE
By MILTON HOWARD

A man is standing on the steps of the U.S. Treasury Building in
downtown New York. He is shouting his contempt for any American
who believes we can have peace in this world. He says suchAmericans
are “Kremlin dupes.” He derides them as “egg-heads and appeasers.”

The speaker is Joe McCarthy, U.S. Senator from Wisconsin.

He holds the crowd’s attention. He has studied the trade of lashing
hysteria into an audience. Five years ago, he was a little known politi-
cian. Today, his name has become known throughout the world. He has
baptized the political fact known as McCarthyism.

Americans began to get a whiﬁ’ of this new fact when millions sud-
denly faced what is now known as “The Reign of Fear.”

Three years ago, the President of the U.S.A. startled the world. He
said that the American citizens of the state of Wisconsin were afraid
to sign a public petition saying they agreed with the democratic prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Independence!

That was McCarthyism on the march!

Today, this fear to speak has become known in every town; village
and city, in the churches, schools, newspapers, and universities.

At the same time, American anger is growing. People are waking up.
Millions are saying “Stop!” to this raid on our traditional political
freedoms. A p W

What is it all about? '

The answer is no mystery. 7

McCarthyism is not just a certain brutal,-method of hunting down ,

what it calls “subversion,” although that is part of it.

McCarthyism is both a method and a political policy.

McCarthyism uses the brutal method to enforce a deliberate political
policy on the United States.

To attack the “method” without challenging the policy is only a part
of the fight against the Reign of.'Fear.

The ﬁght to save America from McCarthyism can only be won if

3

 

 

the political frauds which underlie the “method”—its false‘ assump-
tions and its Big Lie——are all challenged directly, head-on, at the same
time. '

We have seen “McCarthys” before. *

Hitler was Germany’: McCarthy. Mussolini was Italy’s McCarthy.
Franco is the McCarthy of fascist Spain. ’

When the U.S.A., in the 1930's, faced depression, another would-be
McCarthy arose. This was the notorious Father Coughlin. While Ger-
many “solved” its crisis of the 1930’s by letting the Ruhr industrialists
put the Nazis into power, the American people, labor especially, insisted
on a different road. They insisted on-——and got—the road of the New
Deal and democratic advance.

Coughlin summoned the United States to destroy this democratic-
Labor advance as the work of “the Jews” and “the Communists.” In
1936, Coughlin shouted to America to follow him: ‘y‘I take the road to

Fascism.” But America would not follow.

Today, McCarthy raises the same banner with a dilferent slogan
on it. -

Hitler wiped out democracy and peace while promising “National
Socialism” to the German people. *

McCarthy seeks to convince America that he is saving its democ-
racy from “aggression,” “creeping Socialism” and “inﬁltration.” It is a
dead certainty that there will not be a shred of democracy in a
McCarthyized United States. America will lie at the mercy of a gang
hungry for war as the “solution” to the nation’s problems.

How do the “McCarthys” of fascism operate?

Here we get down to the heart of the McCarthy conspiracy.
McCarthy has studied well the tricks and strategies of the other “Mc-
Carthys” who took over Germany, Spain, and Italy.

In each case, the “McCarthy” conspiracy singled out some aspect
of the Big Lie about Marxism and Communism. Once the country fell
for that Big Lie, it was sunk.

Hitler told Germany that its troubles--unemployment, poverty, low, '

wages--were a direct result of a “world-wide Jewish-Bolshevik con-
spiracy” helped by the “Jewish-plutocracies,” Britain and the United
States. To this, Hitler added the other .Big Lie, that the Soviet Union,
Britain and the USA. were “encircling it” and robbing it of “living
space.”

The German people, in large numbers, swallowed this hokum. Those
who ,didn’t were jailed or killed as “traitors.” p
~ It appalled the civilized world to see intelligent Germans eagerly
believing that the key to Germany’s economic and social problems was
“the Jews” and “the Communists.” ‘Franco and Mussolini followed the
same pattern in .varying degrees.

McCarthyism’s “Secret Weapon”

Now, what does McCarthyism tell the people of the United States?
The “secret weapon” of McCarthyism is its constantly repeated lie
that America’s social and economic development of the past twenty
years——from the New Deal, through the war against Hitler, down to
the present—-can be explained by the presenceof “Soviet spies” inside
the Federal government, speciﬁcally the Roosevelt New Deal and the

* Truman Fair Deal administrations.

This special McCarthy hoax rests on a number of other deceptions
for which there is not, nor can there be, the slightest evidence:

LIE NO. 1. That Marxism—and the parties which base their activi-
ties on Marxism——is a “conspiracy.” V

The truth is that conspiracy and Marxism are opposites, since Marx-
ism. (and Marxist parties) bases itselfion actual, objective social condi-
tions, on the actual movements of millions of people ‘acting in defense
of their economic interests. Marxism is the social science which requires
for its application the support and approval of millions of people; it
cannot ‘be a conspiracy. ,

LIE  2. That since the Soviet government is a Socialist govern-

. ment all Communists in other landsare “Soviet agents.”

This is a fraud which deliberately overlooks the fact that Commu-
nists 'in'every country must base their views, proposals, tactics, etc.
solely on the real interests of their own people and nation, They could
never hope, otherwise, to gain the support of the majority of the people,
which is their aim. That these social proposals are not in contradic-
tions with the peace policy of the Soviet Union is due to the fact that
a Socialist state does not have aims hostile to any other people’s interests.

LIE NO. 3. That the Soviet Union relentlessly seeks “world can-
quest” as part of the doctrine of Marxism.

5

 

_ This is a blatant deceit, which even the majority of the non-"Socialist
world openly refuses any longer to believe in. The unwavering eﬂ'-orts
of the Soviet Union for peace with all states, for peaceful co-existence
of different social systems, for ending the Korean war, and‘ for outlaw-
ing all atomic weapons, has convinced the majority of the human race
that the “world conquest” propaganda aimed against it is a lie. There
is, for example, in Western Europe not a trace of “civil defense” prep-
arations against “attack.”

The above listed lies are standard for professional “a.nti-Commu-
nism.” But McCarthyism goes beyond them. McCarthy takes these gen-
eralized falsehoods of the “Truman Doctrine” and the “cold war” and
whips up something special in the way of the Big Lie.

This is its own special Big Lie which goes like this-——

The S-oviet government needs “spies” to ferret out the “atomic
secret” and other “secrets”; that such “spies” are recruited from the
ranks of progressives, New Deal-minded liberals, and from Marxist
parties. '

ministrations of F .D.R. and Truman have been “infiltrated” by this
“Soviet conspiracy” and, despite all pleas from the Dies Committee,
from J. Edgar Hoover and his F.B.I., the two Democratic Party admin-
istrations, as well as top military and political oﬂicials, refused to oust
“the spies.” ’

As a result——so the story goes——it has fallen to Joseph McCarthy of
Wisconsin to wage what he calls “my ﬁght against communism in gov-
ernment.” He borrows this slogan literally from Hitler’s Mein Kampf.
For any American to refuse to accept this leadership in “My Fight” is
to display either active support for the “Communist conspiracy,” or to
be a “dupe,” which is just as bad.

To “sell” this Big Lie-—which we shall refute factually—McCarthy-
ism has spawned in the United States a high-powered machinery of
professional stoolpigeons, hired “ex-Communist” informers, ready to
swear to any myth. Most of them have got rich doing this work
(Whittaker Chambers, $100,000; Louis Budenz, $75,000, to cite just
two). - V

The McCarthy myth does not have a single solitary item of evidence
for it. It could not have, because it is a myth. But it is a myth built up
by millions of screaming headlines in the press. It is a myth which has

6

Furthermore, for the past twentyyears, the Democratic Party ad- V

 

great power for evil, just as Hitler’s myths about the “Jewish banker
plots” helped to destroy millions of lives till he was stopped by the

American-Soviet alliance. ,

As this is written, the McCarthy myth has just been enshrined in an
oﬂicial Senate Report issued by the Jenner Committee. '

This is a fantastic piece of political forgery.

The Jenner Committee uses the known fact——and very admirable
fact——that there were pro-labor progressives, and even an occasional
Marxist, employed by the Government during the New Deal period, to
assert that the entire New Deal, its ‘prb-labor and pro-farmer policies,
as well as its later war alliance with the U.S.S.R. against fascism was
nothing but the “plot” of “Soviet spies.” , ‘

To show what the McCarthy Big Lie means by “espionage” and
“subversion,” the Jenner committee actually dares to assert, in the words
of a national weekly that “strikes in the 19303, the loss of China . . .
the so-called M orgenthau. Plan.” were due to the fact that “all through
the years of the New Deal, conspirators operated close to the seats of
power. Their handswere manipulating labor policy in the strike waves
of the 1930’s. . . . The Morgenthau Plan for turning industrial Germany
into a pastorallstate was hatched in this group. . . . They tried to ‘get
hold of farm policy. . . . [They hatched] the moves that ended with
Communist control of »China . . . the conspirators are not all exposed
and, some continue to operate in the =‘Government.”

Is it not getting clearer what McCarthyism means by “Soviet
spies”? —
McCarthyism is trying to sell to the American people the Big
Business-NAM philosophy that the historically necessary and inevi-
table rise of the trade unions during the 1930’s in which millions of
American workers took part, was not due to the needs of the wbrkers
andtheir determination to ﬁght for better standards, but was a “plot”
dictated by far-oﬂ “men in the Kremlin.”  ’—

Similarly, McCarthyism tries to sell the American people the fraud
that the enormous social changes in Asia, which led to the Chinese
people ousting the grafter-dictator Chiang Kai-shek, were caused not
by the poverty and land-hunger of hundreds of millions of peasants,
but by American scholars like Owen Lattimore, by the “traitor” Gen-
eral Marshall, and others who simply told some of the objective facts
about Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese‘ Revolution.

7

 

With this lunatic kind of thinking (very similar to the “Jews did
it” hoax of Hitler and Goebbels) it only remains for the McCarthy-
ites to prove that America became an ally of the Soviet Union against
Japan and Germany solely because there were “spies” in the Roose-
velt Cabinet, or maybe because Roosevelt was himself “a Soviet spy.”

In fact, this, idea has already begun to be broached by the pro-
fascist writers of modern history. ‘

Just as American labor’s economic needs are wiped out in the
clouds of a “Soviet spy plot,” so the fascist attack on the United States
at Pearl Harbor is wiped out in the theory of “Sovietspies in high
places” who would not let America surrender to the fascist Axis.

One Lie Leads to Another

You see how it started and how it works. .

McCarthyism ﬁrst launches the fraud that the Soviet Union needs
“spies” to get our-“secrets” and determine Washington policies; and
that such “spies” are New Dealers or Marxists.

From this fraud, McCarthyism swiftly moves on to enlarge the
attack. It now echoes the notorious union-smashing, labor-hating
propaganda of the biggest trusts. ‘ -

In this propaganda, the whole rise of the C10 in the 1930’s was a
“communist plot.”\ The existence of a popular demand for cheap
public power, Federal health protection, and social security, are all
viewed as “creeping Socialism,” foisted on unsuspecting Americans
by “communist inﬁltration” and the “communist conspiracy.”

It was relatively easy to sell to many Americans the lie about “So-
viet spies.” They could not have the means for seeing its falsity.

The second lie about the “creeping Socialism” of the American
labor movement’s social program will not be so easy to sell.

But to defend this progressive social program from being wiped
out by Big Business forces itching to get back to “the good old days,”
it is necessary for the American people to see through the lie of the
“Soviet spies” and the “communist conspiracy” just as much as they
see through the lie about the “creeping Socialism” of public power,
Federal health and social security. ~

For these two lies go hand in hand. a

On what is the McCarthyite Big Lie about “Soviet spies” based?

8

 

 

On the absurdity that Soviet science and industry are too back-
ward to be able to master all the elements of modern science and tech- _
nology required for making the A-bomb and the H-bomb, that they
must “steal” our science. But every scientist knows that this is false. ,
They know, and have stated, that in many phases of science, the Soviet
Union actually’ leads the world.

It was not, for example, the Soviet Union which had to try to steal
the advanced Soviet-created MIG jet-plane; it was the Pentagon that
had to resort to this tactic.

A Secondly, there is the falsehood that such “secrets” can be trans-
, mitted on scraps of paper. This was charged in the horrible Rosen-
~  berg frame-up. ,

But there is not a single reputable American scientist who will
agree with this. On the contrary, America’s top atom scientists, Dr.
Albert Einstein, Dr. Harold Urey, and Dr. Ralph Lapp of the 
hattan Atom Project, speciﬁcally and publicly reject the government’s
and McCarthyism’s frenzied propaganda on this point.

McCarthyism takes the known fact that all modern states have In-

‘ telligence Services. It twists it into the Big Lie that since the Soviet
