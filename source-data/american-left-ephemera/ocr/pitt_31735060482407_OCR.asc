:bout his exact role in the Final So-
lution, Dr. Arendt seems to ‘be am-
biguous. She tells us that Eichmann
“succeeded . . . in acquiring a key
position in the whole process because
his office organized the means of trans-
portation” (p. 136, italics added).
His “position was that of the most
important conveyor belt in the whole
operation” (p; 137, italics added).
She notes “the main crime, to which
he had confessed, namely, that he had
shipped people to their death in full
awareness of what he was doing” (p.
193). :She speaks of his “murderous
zeal” and says he “had done his work
with a zeal far beyond the call of
duty” (p. 112).
Yet Dr. Arendt tries to shield Eich-
man from the charge that he was in-
volved in the installation of gas ovens
to expedite the extermination of Jews,
despite supporting evidence by
Rudolph Hoess, commandant at Ausch-
witz, and by Dr. Ernst Wetzel, head of
the Nazi Party’s “Race Political
Office” until 1941, when he was trans-
ferred to Alfred Rosenberg’s Ministry
for Occupied Eastern Territories (the
latter, ignored by Dr. Arendt, is in
Russell’s work cited, pages 77, 229-30,
270). On p. 81 she asserts ﬂatly, “And
with the use of as Eichmann had
’nothing whatever to do” (although in
The New Yorker she had written
“Eichmann probably . . .). Yet. on p.
95 she is more cautious: “It is un-
likely that he was” (“involved in
Gasgeschichten”), but she adds imme-
diately, “one of his men, Rolf Guen-
ther might have become interested of
his own accord.” Here Dr. Arendt gets
entangled in another problem: appar-
ently she would have us believe that

10

Eichmann’s subordinates (like Cuen-
ther) were permitted the initiative to
get involved in such serious matters
as Gasgeschichten (gas ovens) on their
own, while Eichmann himself insisted
he never exercised any initiative ex-
cept once, in Sept., 1941 when, “for
the ﬁrst and last time,” as he said, he
“took an initiative”-—to help the Jews
(p. 88)! (Of course, on p. 122 Dr.
Arendt remarks that Eichmann in
1944 “began, once more, taking initia-
tives” in Hungary in violation of Him-
ler’s order to discontinue the Final
Solution (also p. 183).

But more germane to Dr. Arendt’s
main thesis than Eichmann’s connec-
tion with gassing of Jews is her
strained View that Eichmann, as he
“had steadfastly insisted . . . was guilty
only of ‘aiding and abetting’ in the
commission of the crimes with which
he was charged, that he himself had
never committed an overt act” ( p.
224-). For some reason, Dr. Arendt
believes that “The judgment, to one’s
great relief, in a way recognized that
the prosecution had not succeeded in
proving him wrong on this point.” We
do not like to disturb her “great re-
lief,” but we read her own quotation
from the judgment of the Court
quite differently: “in such an enor-
mous and complicated crime as the
one we are now considering, wherein
many people participated, on various
levels and in various modes of ac-
tivity—the planners, the organizers,
and those executing the deeds, accord-
ing -to their various ranks—-there is
not much point in using the ordinary
concepts of counseling and soliciting
to commit a crime. For these crimes
were committed en masse, not only in
regard to the number of victims, but
also in regard to the numbers of those
who perpetrated the crime, and the

extent to which any one of the many
criminals was close to or remote
from the actual killer of the victim
means nothing, as far as the measure
of his responsibility is concerned. On
the contrary, in general the degree of
responsibility increases as we draw
further away from the man who uses
the fatal instrument with his own
hands” (p. 225, italics added). Now
the part we have italicized indicates
clearly enough that the Court was re-
jecting Eichmann’s defense that he
had committed no overt act and was
only “aiding and abetting” (or, in
Israeli phrasing, “counseling and
soliciting”) as pointless in this kind of
case. Dr. Arendt must be desperate
indeed to find “great relief” even in a
distortion of these plain words. (We
reserve for later discussion an even
more horrendous distortion of the
meaning of the last sentence in the
passage quoted above.)

It is appropriate here also to quote
the words of the Court in sentencing
Eichmann: “the dispatch by the Ac-
cused of every train carrying a thou-
sand souls to Auschwitz, or to any of
the other places of extermination,
amounted to direct participation by
him in one thousand acts of premedi-
cated murder, and his legal and moral
responsibility for these murders is in
no way less than the measure of lia-
bility of him who with his own hands
put those persons into the gas-cham-
-bers” (Lord Russell, work cited, p.
341).

In this framework, of what use is
Dr. Arendt’s ﬂaunted idea of “the
banality of evil,” which in her View
sums up the main lesson of Eich-
m,ann’s “long course in human wicked-
ness” (p. 231)? Is that all we learn
—that evil, such evil, genocidal evil,
is banal, that is, to give the diction-

JULY-Aucvsr, 1963

ary meanings of the term, hackneyed,
trite, commonplace, stale, stereotyped,
inane, insipid, boring? So Eichmann
is just a normal fellow in a vicious
systcln, Everyman. banal, “unindoc-
trinated” but full of clichés! This
seems as empty as the “empty talk” in
which the garrulous but evasive
Eichmann tried to drown the Court.

There remains, however, one
more aspect of Dr. Arendt’s picture
of Eichmann that we have deliber-
ately delayed to this point because it
opens up a new area of discussion. Dr.
Arendt was, as her autobiographical
sketch indicates, a member of the
Zionist movement from 1935 to 1943
and then again in 1948. What can this
ex-Zionist mean when she reports that
Eichmann’s reading “Theodor Herzl’s
Der Judenstaat, the famous Zionist
classic converted Eichmann
promptly and forever to Zionism”
(p. 36) ? That the cynical and evasive
Eichmann should make the claim is
one thing; for her to seem to accept
it at face value is another. Is she say-
ing this with tongue in cheek? She
began the paragraph in which this
sentence occurs with the statement
that “Eichmann’s account” is “dis-
torted, of course, but not wholly de-
void of truth” (p. 36). She often re-
peats the idea in one form or another.
It is true that on p. 172 she refers to
Eichmann’s “foolish and stubborn con-
tention that he had saved the lives of
hundreds of thousands of Jews
through ‘forced emigration’,” but
then adds that “one begins to wonder”
whether he had not really perhaps
saved lives ‘by this, forsooth, pro-
Zionism. When Eichmann discusses
the Madagascar project (of shipping
four million Jews to French Madagas-
car!) as a part of his “Zionist” idea
of “putting ﬁrm ground under the feet

11

  
  

of the Jews,” Dr. Arendt remarks
ﬁrmly that “The Madagascar plan was
always meant to serve as a cloak un-
der which preparations for the physi-
cal extermination of all Jews of West-
ern Europe could be carried forward”
(p. 71).

We are compelled to report that,
having combed the relevant passages
for evidence of Dr. Arendt’s tongue
in cheek on this matter of Eichmann’s
“Zionism,” we ﬁnd plenty of cheek-—
even plenty of lip-—but no tongue-
in-cheek. Now Dr. Bettelheim, in his

review already quoted, refers in one’.

grave matter that we shall discuss
later to Dr. Arendt’s “ambiguity”
that gives rise to “misunderstanding.”
Dr. Arendt speaks plainly of “the pro-
Zionist stage” (p. 70) of the Nazi
program. Since this concept elicited
amazement and criticism when it was
ﬁrst published in The New Yorker,
Dr. Arendt had time to erase any am-
biguity that was unintentional. The
fact that she did not do so conﬁrms
our conclusion that, incredible as it
may seem, she accepts Eichmann’s ac-
count as “not wholly devoid of the
truth.” It is not that Dr. Arendt hesi-
tates, when she is touched to the quick,
to record her reaction promptly. Thus
when Eichmann “suddenly declared
with great emphasis that he had lived

12

his whole life according to Kant’s
moral precepts, and especially accord-
ing to a Kantian deﬁnition of duty,”
Dr. Arendt immediately thunders:
“This is outrageous, on the face of
it” (p. 120).

Finally, we would remind Dr.
Arendt that the trial Court, in its judg-
ment, indicated that ‘-‘as far -back as
Nov., 1937, after an espionage trip
into the Middle East he reported that
the plan for emigration of Jews to
Palestine ‘was out of the question,’ it
being ‘the policy of the Reich to avoid
the creation of an independent Jew-
ish State in Palestine’ ” (Justice Mi-
chael A. Musmanno, The N. Y. Times
Book Review, May 19).

The implications of her view of
Eichmann as a “Zionist” we shall dis-
cuss'in our next issue, in which we
shall also analyze Dr.‘Arendt’s indict-‘
ment of the Eichmann trial as a whole,
of the Court, the Prosecution, the Wit-
nesses and the Defense (they were all
in varying degrees just no good), her
thesis that the Jews extensively col-
laborated in their own destruction, her
overall view of relations between the
Zionists and Nazis, how freely she deals
with “evidence,” and the disservice all
this renders to the cause of making
the world Nazirein.

Her attack on the Eichmann trial:

prosecution, defense and court

R. HANNAH Arendt, we dem-

onstrated in our first article
(July-Aug. issue), regards Eichmann
as little more than a shnook acciden-
tally caught up somehow in the toils
of the Nazi murder-mechanism. That
our reading of her Eichmann-portrait
is by no means strained can be seen
from the way it impressed the Yale
Law School Dean Eugene V. Rostow
in his May 18 review in the N. Y.
Herald Tribune Books: “the trivial,
pathetic, nearly comic personality of
Eichmann” (perhaps to be portrayed
in a film by Chaplin?!); “Eichmann
as a ﬁgure out of Kafka—a mild and
inadequate bureaucrat, who lived for
his promotions”; “the casual, almost
accidental nature of his involvement
in the administrative machinery of
Jewish extermination”; “that poor,
confused, petty, evil man who thought
clichés and spoke in the official lan-
guage of a minor bureaucrat”; Dr.
Rostow even implies that Eichmann’s
“part in the proceedings was peri-
pheral or half-rational.”

Now such a view of Eichmann
leads Dr. Arendt to an all-out attack
on the trial itself, which she brands
ﬂatly as a “failure” (p. 251) and
many reviewers are already falling for
this outrageous judgment. Dr. Bruno
Betlelheim in The New Republic

SEPTEMBER, 1963

June .15 writes that “It was a trial
where the witnesses had their day in
court, but hardly the accused”! And
Stephen Spender in the N. Y. Review
of Books Spring Issue found that “a
heavy suspicion also hangs over the
Jerusalem court itself in these pages”
and is already worried about “the ef-
fects of precedents from this trial. . . .”!

Her attack on the trial is sweeping
and involves the prosecution, the de-
fense, the witnesses and the judges;
even the defendant did not do a proper
job in his own behalf because of his
infernally had memory, as we indi-
cated in our first article.

Right on p. 3 she announces that
the issue in this trial is between
“Justice” on the one hand and the
“State of Israel” on the other. She
sees Israel not as the instrument of
Justice but as the .opponent, the very
traducer of Justice!

The arch-traducer to her is then
Premier David Ben-Gurion, whom she
-calls “the invisible stage manager of
the proceedings” (p. 3.). She rightly
scores some of Ben-Gurion’s pro-
nouncements before the trial, just as
we did in our pre-trial discussions.
In our Sept., "1960 issue (p. 5) we
objected to his claim that Israel would
try Eichmann in the name of all the
Jews of the world, since we believe

13

 

 

  
  

Israel can act only in its own name
and can never legally and formally
speak for the Jews of the world (al-
though it sometimes can express the
sentiment of most of the Jews of. the
world, as it did in trying and exe-
cuting Eichmann). In our March,
1961 issue we also dissented from
Ben-Gurion’s declaration that “only a
Jewish state can try him, from a moral
point of view,” since any state that
seized Eichmann and tried him would
have had the moral right to do so.
In fact, under the provisions for deal-
ing with World War II war criminals
adopted by the Geneva -Convention in
1949 and ratiﬁed by the USA, every
state in the UN has an obligation to
seize war criminals and bring them to
justice.

But our dilferences with Ben-Gurion
on this and other issues do not blind
us, as they do Dr. Arendt, to the value
for international morality and justice
of this trial. Indeed one of our criti-
cisms of Ben-Gurion is quite the op-
posite of that by Dr. Arendt: she
objects to the extensive scope of the
trial; we object to the narrow limits
Ben-Gurion tried to set in order to
protect the Nazis in government and
public life in Adenauer’s West Ger-
many from being exposed at the trial.
Perhaps disobeying Ben-Gurion, “his
master,” as Dr. Arendt calls him,
Prosecutor Gideon Hausner did ﬁnally
bring into the record scores of’ such
names, including that of Dr. Hans

}lobke, Adenauer’s right hand man
as State Secretary.

Dr. Arendt’s first allegation
against the trial is that it was a
“show trial” (p. 2) and “a bloody
show” (p. 7). We are told that “Jus-
tice insists” that “on trial are his

14-

deeds, not the sufferings of the
Jews . . .” (p. 3) while instead, in
Jerusalem, “this case was built on
what the Jews had suffered, not on
what Eichmann had done” (p. 4-).
If Eichmann “suffers, he must suffer
for what he has done, not for what
he has caused others to suffer” (p.
6).

Are we obtuse, or is Dr. Arendt
supersubtle? To us it would seem
that what Eichmann did was criminal
because he caused others to suifer,
that, except in “conspiracy” cases,
common sense and the law merge in
understanding that where there is no
injury there" is no crime. (In the
United States, one can be found guilty
of “conspiring” to commit a crime
even if one did not commit it—as in

the case of Morton Sobell, who was

convicted of “conspiring” to give
away classiﬁed information, not of
actually doing so.)

However, can it be that Dr. Arendt
has any doubt about what Eichmann
did, that is, about his guilt? When
she seeks to discredit the trial as a
“failure” is it because an innocent
man has been led to “suffer” “injus-
tice” at the hands of the State of
Israel?

To reach such a reasonable conclu-
sion would be to underestimate the tor-
tuousness of Dr. Arendt’s_ thought-
processes. By p. 51 she casually re-
veals that she and we and everyone
else knew all along that Eichmann
is guilty: “The facts for which Eich-
mann was to hang had been estab-
lished ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’
long before the trial was :started, and
they were generally known to all stu-
dents of the Nazi regime.” (This idea
is restated in almost the same words
also on pages 85 and 191). What
she may be referring to, although
she does not say so because it might

JEWISH CURRENTS

 

reﬂect credit on the Nuremberg
Trials, is that the Judgment of those
trials, rendered Oct. 1, 1946, had
found that Eichmann had been in
charge of exterminating the Jews.

Well, if Eichma-nn was known to
be guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt”
before the trial, what is wrong, mor-
ally, legally or politically, with using
a ‘trial that can do no more than
conﬁrm Eichmann’s widely known
guilt, to display—-for those who have
forgotten or never knew—“what the
Jews had suffered”? Paraphrasing
the Judgment of the trial court in
Jerusalem, Lord Russell reports that
“one of the objects of the trial” was
“to put on record a precise historical
description of the events which oc-
curred during the catastrophe and, in
so doing, to emphasize the heroic
feats performed by the ghetto ﬁghters
and the resistance put up by the Jew-
ish partisans in Poland and Russia”
(The Record, p. 301). What rational
purpose can there be in Dr. Arendt’s
outburst against this aspect of the
trial?

Yet Dr. Arendt begins her con-
cluding chapter with the untrue and
shocking judgment that “the irregu-
larities and abnormalities of the trial

. were so many, so varied and of
such legal complexity that they over-
shadowed during the trial, as they have
in the surprisingly small amount of
post-trial literature, the central moral,
political and even legal problems that
the trial inevitably posed” (p. 232).

It is simply not true that during

_or since the trial have the main

problems been “overshadowed” by the
character of the trial. Outside Nazi
and neo-Nazi circles, Dr. Arendt’s is
the first signiﬁcant voice to indict the
trial itself. Not only does a trained
legal observer like Lord Russell de-

SEPTEMBER, 1963

clare the trial was “scrupulously
fair” but a study of over 2,000 United
States newspapers and periodicals as-
certained that “seven of every eight
papers discussing the subject found
that the trial had been conducted
with ‘impressive dignity,’ ‘remarkable
restraint,’ ‘scrupulous fairness’ ”
(The Eichmann Case in the American
Press, American Jewish Committee,
Aug., 1962, p. 18).

But even though others disagree,
is there substance to her charge? We
ﬁnd none.

Dr. Arendt would have us believe
that “actually at the root of all the
failures and shortcomings of the
Jerusalem trial” (p. 246) is the in-
ability of the Jews to this day to
understand the “unprecedented crime
of genocide,” the attempt to extermi-
nate" the Jewish people. All in the
courtroom, we are asked to believe,
really thought genocide was just an
old-fashioned pogrom, only bigger:
“not much more than the most hor-
rible pogrom in Jewi:sh history.”

We think this is nonsense——-and
such nonsense opens to serious ques-
tion Dr. Arendt’s capacity both for
observation and judgment. Now it
may be true that before and during
the war most of the Jews trapped in
Nazi dominated Europe had diﬂiculty
in believing or understanding that
the Nazis really intended to extermi-
nate the Jewish people. Nazi cunning
and deception, as we shall see again
in another part of this essay, worked
mightily to keep the Jews from grasp-
ing this fact. But the Jews having
paid the terrible price of inability,
unwillingness or even refusal to un-
derstand the meaning of genocide by
losing 6,000,000, how can it be said
that the Jewish people today, and cer-
tainly those involved in the trial, are
still blind to the obvious fact?

15

 

Even more confused is Dr.
Arendt’s “charge” that the “partici-
pants” in Jerusalem—-which can only
mean the prosecution, the judges and
-the witnesses — actually “believed,”
poor benighted souls, “that a direct
line existed from the early anti-Semi-
tism of the Nazi Party to the Nurem-
burg Laws an from there to the ex-
pulsion of Jews from the Reich and,
ﬁnally, to the gas chambers” (p. 246) .
Well, is there no “direct line” from
the first through to the last? How
much vision is required to’ see this
“direct line”? What kind of vision

is it that even questions its exist-'

ence?

Yet Dr. Arendt “triumphantly” ex-
claims in her next sentence: “Politi-
cally and legally, however, these
were ‘crimes’ different not only in
degree of seriousness but in essence.”
We submit that in logic and in practice
the differences do I not obliterate the
“direct line.” We may also remi-nd
Dr. Arendt that Dr. Hilberg, upon
whom she relies so heavily in those
marginal aspects of his book in which
he is unfortunately quite unreliable
(see Ber Mark in our April issue),
draws a conclusion she might well
have heeded: “The destruction of the
Jews was thus no accident. When in
the early days of 1933 the ﬁrst civil
servant wrote the ﬁrst deﬁnition of a
‘non-Aryan’ into a civil service or-
dinance, the fate of European Jewry
was sealed” (p. 669).

Finally, the Court and the Prose-
cution were as well aware as anybody
of both the distinctiveness of geno-
cide—and of Eichmann’s crime—and
of its “direct line” to earlier phases
of Hitler’s program. In fact, Prose-
cutor Hausner had deﬁned the dis-
tinctiveness of the crime in the
eighth paragraph of his magniﬁcent
opening address to the Court: “This

16

unprecedented crime, carried out by
Europeans in the 20th century, led
to the deﬁnition of a criminal concept
unknown to human annals even dur-
ing the darkest ages—the crime of
Genocide” (“6,000,0i)0 Accusers,” The
Jerusalem Post, 1961, p. 31, italics
added).

Before we consider her indictment
of the Eichmann trial speciﬁcally, we
should note that in her sweep Dr.
Arendt is by no means discriminating
against Israel by her strictures. In
fact she assures us, far from reassur-
ingly, that the Jerusalem Court’s
“failures were neither in kind nor
in degree greater than the failures of
the Nuremburg Trials” or the subse-
quent trials by the Americans, British,
French, Russians, Poles, Yugoslavs,
Czechoslovaks, Belgians, Danes and

' Dutch (p. 251)! Thus hooting, at all

the post-war trials of war criminals
as merely victors’ justice, Dr. Arendt
condescendingly remarks that “part
of the failure of the Jerusalem court
was due to its all too eager adher-
ence to the Nuremburg precedent
wherever possible.”

Now we submit that, despite its
critics and despite the possible short-
comings of the Nuremburg Trials,
they constitute a landmark in the de-
velopment of international law—and
the Eichmann trial, following in its
wake, will take its honored place in
that development.

_])R. ARENDT sums up “the failure

of the Jerusalem court” as its
“not coming to grips with three
fundamental issues . . .: the problem
of impaired justice in the court of the
victors; a valid deﬁnition of the ‘crime
against humanity’; and a clear- recog-
nition of the new criminal who com-
mits this crime” (p. 251).
A scrutiny of her points leads us

J EWISII CURRENTS

 

to the opposite conclusions. On the
first point, Dr. Arendt asserts that
“justice was more seriously impaired
in Jerusalem than it was at Nurem-
berg, because the court did not ad-
mit wntnesses for the defense” (p.
251).

But is is not true that the prosecu-
tion “did not admit witnesses for the
defense.” What the prosecution did
was to refuse to grant to those wit-
nesses who were themselves war crim-
inals any immunity from arrest if
they came to Israel to testify in be-
half of the universally known’ war
criminal, Eichmann. (Two witnesses,
Wilhelm Hoettl and Walther Huppen-
kothen of Austria, were in fact prom-
ised immunity but refused to come
anyway.) Since Defense Counsel’s list
of witnesses he wished to call con-
sisted wholly of war criminals (seven
of them indeed already in German
prisons), the Jerusalem court went
out of its way to accommodate the
defense. Therefore 16 defense wit-
nesses were examined in courts of l'aw
in Germany, Austria and Italy, usually
in the presence of both defense and
prosecution representatives, with limit-
ed cross-examination of the ﬁrst re-
plies to the questions. The fact that
none of the witnesses produced mate-
rial favorable to Eichmann is imma-
terial.

Now why should the Jerusalem court
have granted immunity to war crim-
inals for testifying in Eichmann’s be-
half? And knowing Dr. Arendt’s tortu-
ous procedures, we wonder whether, if
the Court had granted such immunity,
she would not then have discounted
the testimony because, you know, it
might have been motivated or inﬂu-
enced by the guarantee of immunity.

In her second count against the
Jerusalem court, Dr. Arendt ar-

SEPTEMBER, 1963

gues that it did not provide “a valid
deﬁnition of the ‘crime against
humanity’ ”——by which she means a
crime that upsets “the international
order and mankind it its entirety”
(p. 252).

Now the facts are these: the Nazis
and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment)
Law, 5710-1950, under which Eich-
mann was tried, deﬁnes the “crime
against -humanity” as “any of the fol-
lowing acts: murder, extermination,
enslavement, starvation or deportation
and other inhumane acts committed
against any civilian population, and
persecution on national, racial, reli-
gious or political grounds” (6,000,000
Accusers, Appendix, p. 309). This
deﬁnition is based squarely on Art.

6 of the Nuremberg Charter, with the 1

difference that the words italicized
above were added by the Israeli Knes-
set (Hilberg, p. 687, for Art. 6 and
its history).

Interestingly enough, Dr. Arendt
concedes that “the ﬁndings of the
Jerusalem court were incomparably
better than those at Nuremberg” be-
cause “it was the great advantage of
a trial centered on the crime against
the Jewish people” (as the Nurem-
berg Trials were not) that it “clari-
ﬂed” the “difference between ‘inhu-
man acts’ . . . and the ‘crime against
humanity,’ whose intent and purpose
were unprecedented,” that is, genocide.

Nevertheless Dr. Arendt concludes
-this section (p. 252) by insisting that
on this count too the Jerusalem court
was a “failure” because “at no point
. . . either in the proceedings or in the
judgment, did the Jerusalem trial
ever mention even the possibility that
extermination of the whole ethnic
groups——the Jews, or the Poles, or the
Gypsies——might be more than a crime
against the Jewish or the Polish or
the Gypsy people, that the interna-

17

 

M W

   

tional order, and mankind in its en-
tirety, might have been grievously
hurt and endangered.”

On this extreme stricture, we would
make two observations: 1) Jacob
Robinson, who was Mr. Hausner’s
“Special Assistant” at the trial, has
pointed out, in Hadassah Magazine
for June, that “the court expressly
stated (Section 16) that the crimes
against the Jewish people are crimes
under the law of nations, the impli-
cation being—a crime against the
world order, for whose protection the
law of nations exists. Only amateurs
believe that this must be spelled out
in so many words.” 2) Chapter 10 of
Prosecutor Hausner’s Opening Ad-
dress deals speciﬁcally with what the
extermination of the Jews means for
European and world culture and civi-
lization.

As for Dr. Arendt’s third indict-A

ment of the Jerusalem court, that it
failed to understand Eic-hmann and
the type of criminal he was, we have
already dealt with her picture of Eich-
mann in our ﬁrst article (July- Aug.
issue).

I f one wonders what kind of court
and trial might have met Dr. Arendt’s
requirements, we learn that she would
have preferred a trial -by “an inter-
national court which would have in-
dicted Eichmann, not for crimes
‘against the Jewish people,’ -but for
crimes against mankind on the body
of the Jewish people” (p. 5). On
the matter of the international court,
we can only say that there was and
is no such court, nor is there even
now, after the Eichmann trial, any
serious step to setting up such a court.
When Eichmann was seized, no
government proposed such a court—
and we cannot blame Israel for not
leaping forward with the proposal.

18

Nor can we agree that Eichmann
should not have been tried for his
crimes “against the Jewish people” as
a people. By the time the Israeli Law
of 1950 was passed, the UN Ceno-
cide Convention had already been
adopted on Dec. 9, 1948. Indeed, its
deﬁnition of crimes against a people
(see Stanley Fa'ulkner in our Dec.,
1962 issue, p. 9) in Art. 2 of that
UN Genocide Convention is incorpor-
ated bodily into the Israeli law (two
acts are added: “destroying or dese-
crating Jewish religious or cultural
assets or values; inciting to hatred
of Jews,” with, of course, intent to
destroy the Jewish people). In passing
we note that Dr. Arendt’s statement, p.
247, that Israel had no law covering
genocide is a glaring error, as she-
as well as Denmark and West Germany
—has such a law.

In Israel Eichmann was tried for
crimes against the Jewish people,
crimes against humanity and war
crimes. It is frivolous to infer from
this that the Israeli court did not con-
sider the Jews as part of humanity. In
ordinary criminal law, Joe Blow is
tried for the murder of John Doe
because killing John Doe is both bad
for John Doe and a blow against the
state “on the body of John Doe.” To
insist that Eichmann should have been
tried not for his role in exterminating
the Jews but for what he did to the
international order “on the body of the
Jewish people” seems like hair-
splitting. And to denounce the Eich-
mann trial as a failure for such a rea-
son seems like a strange mixture of
arrogance and foggy thinking.

There was no real alternative to
the Jerusalem trial if Eichmann was
to be tried at all. That Dr. Arendt’s
analysis and speculations are essen-
tially abstract and hollow is suggested
by the reviewer of Dr. Arendt’s book

in The Christian Century May .22.
After swallowing her book whole and
um-ritically as a thought-provoking in-
tellectual exercise, he pulls himself up
short with the following ﬁnal sen-
tences: “Yet despite all the doubts
and controversy [about the Jerusalem
trial] one wonders what else could
have been possible. A few weeks ago
several men were convicted in [West]
Germany of the murder of more than
100,000 Jews. Their prison sentence:
all of three and a half years.” Dr.
Arendt, we.noted in our ﬁrst article,

has herself scoffed at these “fantas-

ti-cally lenient sentences” of West
German courts trying war criminals,
yet her condemnation of the Eichmann
trial will probably delight the West
German judges who blithely hand out
such ou-trageously insulting sentences.

N THE course of her excoriation
of the E-ichmann trial in all of its
aspects, Dr. Arendt is cruelly unfair
to Prosecutor Gideon Hausner. He did
nothing right, according to her. In

his prodigious work and achievement,

she ﬁnds little more than “love of
showmanship” (p. 2), “the theatrics
characteristic of a more than ordinary
vanity” (p. 3) and “grandiose
rhetoric” (p. 6).

In _the memorable first paragraph
of his opening address to the Court,
Mr. Hausner had declared that “I am
not standing alone. With me are six
million accusers. . . . I will -be their
spokesman and in their name I will
unfold the awesome indictment.” Dr.
Arendt pounces on this image to scold
Mr, Hausner: “With such rhetoric the
prosecution gave substance to the chief
argument against the trial, that it
was established not in order to satisfy
the demands of justice but to still the
victims’ desire for and, perhaps, right
to vengeance” (p. 239). Then comes

another such lesson as she gave the
Court above, “The wrongdoer is
brought to justice because his act
has disturbed . . . the community as
a whole . . . the law, n__ot the plaintiff

. must prevail”—all of which was
as clearly understood by the Court and
Prosecutor as by the censorious Dr.
Arendt.

She charges Mr. Hausner with fail-
ing to expose “the complicity of all
German offices and authorities in the
Final Solution” (p. 15), overlooking
the fact that he did just that in his
opening address. She also ignores the
fact that it was Mr. Hausner (and
not Servatius, as she erroneously
insists on p. 16) who on May 12,
1961 introduced into the trial a
document implicating Globke, per-
haps contrary to the wishes of the
Ben-Gurion leadership (see our July-
Aug., 1961 issue, p. 5), as well as
the names of a score of still living war
criminals now in West Germany, the
USA, Latin America and elsewhere.

She also stands the record on its
head when she tries to make Mr.

for all it was worth” the popular
Israeli concept of “the contrast between
Israeli heroism and the submissive
meekness with which Jews went to
their death” in Europe (p. 9). In
fact, Mr. Hausner devoted a section
of his opening address to the Jewish
resistance in the .ghettoes,' in the ex-
termination centers and in partisan
units.

“The great wonder was,” he con-
cluded, “that after years of oppres-
sion, degradation and hunger, the Jews
found spiritual strength for all these
instances of revolt and resistance, in
face of the mighty Gestapo machine
and its deadly power of destruction,
on the one hand, and—on the other
—the Nazis’ trickery, deception and
concealment of their intention to ex-
-terminate the Jews” (6,000,000 Accu-
sers, p. 108). And then, by presenting
witnesses like Zivia Lubetkin Zucker-
man and Abba Kovner, themselves
leaders of the resistance movements,
Mr. Hausner gave Israeli and other
audiences lessons that are apparently,
as we shall see, lost on Dr. Arendt.

How far from sober is her picture
of Mr. Hausner may be seen from
the quite contrary opinion of the trial
judges, who in their final judgment
noted that he had “conducted the
prosecution in all its stages as a
jurist and on a very high professional
level. In his brilliant opening speech
which was eloquent and broad in per-
spective, and again in his concluding
statement, he gave vent also to the
deep feelings which stir the entire
nation.” Can it -be that Dr. Arendt
is so harsh to-wards Mr. Hausner ex-
actly because he gave vent to such
feelings?

WAR-DS Eichmann’s defense

counsel, Dr. Robert Servatius of
Cologne, Dr. Arendt is almost equally

20

sharp. Despite his experience as a
defense counsel at the Nuremberg
Trials, Servatius turned out to be, in
her judgment, a pretty incompetent
defender of Eichmann.

Acting the kibitzer, Dr. Arendt con-
vinces us she herself could have done
a better job for Eichmann in the
courtroom. Servatius could have
quoted so-and-so, but didn’t (p. 21).
He “could have called witnesses” that
he did not call (p. 56). And “if the
defense had brought its own evidence
to bear upon the proceedings” (p.
51), the Court would not have ac-
cepted some of Hausner’s facts, but
Servatius “chose to ignore . . . cer-
tain facts that are well enough known”
(p. 51). In his summation, he failed
to mention some testimony favorable
to Eichmann (p. 59).

Dr. Arendt even chides him for not
falling back on the argument that
Eichmann was acting under “superior
orders as an extenuating circumstance”
before sentence was pronounced (p.
87). She presumes to hint that an
alert defense counsel could have taken
the testimony :"7offered by Hausner’s
witnesses “of-'. close contacts -between
Jewish partisans and the Polish and
Russian underground ﬁghters” and
used it to “offer much better justiﬁ-
cation for the wholesale slaughter of
civilians than Eichmann’s repeated
claim that ‘Weizmann had declared
war on Germany in 1939’” (p. 108).
As one can see, Eichmann, poor fellow,
was so poorly served by Servatius
that no wa'r criminal who reads Dr.
Arendt’s book would ever think of
hiring Servatius to defend him.

On one occasion, however, Dr.
Arendt’s moral gorge rises ap-propri-
ately at Servatius’ unemotional ob-
jectivity in speaking of “killings by
gas, and similar medical matters” (p.
64-). His insistent repetition that “kill-

JEWISH CURRENTS

 

ing . . . is a medical matter” revealed
to Ilr. Arendt unforgettably how "ordi-
nary Germans, not former members of
the S.S. or even of the Nazi Party,
even today can regard ac-ts that in
other countries are called murder . . .”
While one may hesitate to agree with
Dr. Arendt that this incident was “one
of the few great moments in the whole
trial,” Servatius’ formulation is re-
vealing not so much about “ordinary
Germans” as about those, like Ser-
vatius, who go out of their way to
try to discredit the Nuremberg Trials.

Maybe, therefore, if Dr. Joseph

Mengele is ever arrested as a war ‘

criminal, he may ask-for defense by
Servatius despite Dr. Arend-t’s proof
that he botched the Eichmann defense.
tParenthetically, we wonder what Dr.
Arendt would think of the competence
and attitude to his client of Hellmut
Becker, defense counsel for Ernst von
Weizséicker in the 11th of the subse-
quent trials after Nuremberg. “The
accused,” writes Hilberg, pages 694--
95, “were, without exception, so kindly
disposed toward their victims that . . .
Becker began to feel a little crowded.
In a moment of irritation he was
moved to remark: ‘Everybody has
saved the few survivors; nobody has
killed the many dead.’ ”)

FOR most of the witnesses presented
by the prosecution, Dr. Arendt has
little use. She has some respect for
Zindel Crynspan (father of Hershel
Crynspan) and Mrs. Zuckerman, but
most of'the witnesses she regards as
persons rushing into court to parade
their wounds on the misguided theory
of the prosecution that the “sufferings
of the Jewish people” should be dis-
played. She is repulsively contemptu-
ous of K-Zetnick, the somewhat his-
trionic writer whose rambling open-
ing was interrupted by questions from

VIENNA PLAY ON EICHMANN
FRANZ Theodor Csokor, dean of

Austrian dramatists, has written
a play on the Eichmann theme,
“Das Zeichen an der Wand” (The
Writing on the Wall). Written in
1961, it was performed in Vienna
early this year. Csokor, born in
Vienna in 1885, is a non-Jew who
went into voluntary exile in 1938
and spent the years until his re-
turn to Austria in 1946 in Poland,
Romania, Yugoslavia and Italy. Dr.
Harry Zohn of the" German Depart-
ment at Brandeis University found
the play “a convincing picture of
the totalitarian functionary who be-
lieves that he can remain a human
being simultaneously with, and'sub-
sequent to, his murderous mission,
that he can stoke the human fur-
naces by day and enjoy Bach
chaconnes at night.”

Hausner and the Court. “In response,”
remarks Dr. Arendt with as little ele-
mentary human compassion as imagi-
nation, “the disappointed witnws,
probably deeply wounded, fainted and
answered nomore questions” (p. 204-) .
Of ‘the judges individually, Dr.
Arendt has a relatively high opinion.
She praises their “high degree of in-
dependence and fairness” (p. 196)
and their efforts to keep the trial from
becoming a “show trial” under Haus-
ner’s pernicious influence (p. 2). They
“got more out of (Eichmann) in two
and a half short sessions [of cross-
examination] than the prosecution had
been able to elicit in 17” (p. 203).
Nevertheless, although the judges
“tried so hard to understand the ac-
cused” (p. 130) “they never did come
to understand him” (p. 131)—at least
not the way she understands him.
Still seeking to club Hausner, Dr.

21

  
  

 

Arend-t alleges that the judgment of
the Court constitutes “an obvious re-
buff to the prosecution,” that the Court
rewrote “the prosecution’s case” with
a “fundamentally different approach”
(p, 193) . Yet Lord Russell in his book
(p. 324-) notes that the Court ap-
proved Hausner’s general approach.
Finally, since she has so haughtily
judged everybody and everything re-
lated to the trial—the case, the law,
the Court, the prosecution, the defend-
ant, the defense counsel, the witnesses
—Dr. Arendt assumes the juidicial
robes literally and delivers herself of
the almost comically astounding state-
ment, “the justice of what was done
in Jerusalem would have emerged to
be seen by all if the judges had dared
to address their defendant in some-
thing like the following terms” (p.
254). This address to the ‘defendant
by the Court ends, as does the book,

' with this “verdict”—“And just as you

supported and carried out a policy of
not wanting to share the earth with
the Jewish people and the people of
a num r of other nations . . . we
ﬁnd that no one, that is, no member
of the human race, can be expected to

22

want to share the earth with you.
This is the reason, and the only rea-
son, you must hang.”

Talk about grandiose rhetoric! What
is it but rhetoric to say that “no mem-
ber of the human ra-ce can be expected
to want to share the earth with you”
when there are thousands of activists
in the neo-Nazi international who
would not only gladly share the earth
with Eichmann but idolize him, when
governments refuse to extradite war
criminals almost as notorious as Eich-
mann, when other known war criminals
hold high pu-blic office in West

Germany ?

We should rather take our stand
with Israeli Judges Moshe’ Landau,
Benjamin Halevy and Yitzhak Raveh
than with “Judge” Hannah Arendt,
and her strange and misguided at-
tempt to discredit the Eichmann trial.

We have left to the ﬁnal article
a consideration of Dr. Arendt’s pro-
nouncements on Jewish “collabora-
tion,” on relations between Zionists
and Nazis, and similar “provocative”
ideas which she has given meretricious
currency.

JEWISH CURRENTS

 

Her false-focus on Jewish collaboration,

Jewish passivity and Jewish resistance

What was most startling to the so-
phisticated but, in this subject,
uninformed and therefore gullible rea-
ders of The New Yorker series by Han-
nah Arendt was not so much her pic-
ture of Eichmannor of the Eichmann
trial (on which we have dwelt in our
first two articles) but her view of the
Jews of Euro-pe in relation to the Nazis.
Relying upon her authority as an in-
tellectual of note and -upon the fact
that she was a Jew who had once been
active in Zionist affairs for some 15
years, many readers swallowed whole-
sale her exaggerated and distorted pic-
ture of vast Jewish criminal collabor-
ation with the Nazis and of almost to-
tal Jewish passivity and cowardice
hardly relieved by a few futile upris-
ings.

The resulting indigestion induced in
many readers .a feverish disgust with
the Jewish people: self-disgust on the
part of Jews; a contempt that could
become anti-Semitic on the part o-f non-
Jews. The greater the distance from,
or ignorance of, the Nazi mechanism
of deceit and destruction, the more
bellicose was the reader’s fantasy of

a posture of resistance. The greater the '

indifference to Jewish life now or then,
the louder the reader’s wail that “the
Jews” had let the world down: let the
non-Jewish world down by not holding
up their end of the anti-Nazi struggle;

OCTOBER, 1963

let the Jewish world down by being
sheep, not lions. It was contact with
such reader-reaction that first alerted
us to the magnitude of the false-focus
and distortions in this horrendo-us
Arendt picture.

Dr. Arendt’s conclusion has been
widely quoted: “To a Jew this role
of the Jewish leaders in the destruction
of their own people is undoubtedly
the darkest chapter of the whole dark
story” (p. 104-). Now we have been
acutely aware for at least 15 years of
the evil role of the Nazi-appointed
Jewish Councils (Iudenrat) and es-
pecially of the Jewish police, and we
shall return to the subject below. We
know also that the Israeli law under
which Eichmann was tried is a law
for the punishment of Nazis and “Na-
zi Collaborators,” which indicates
that Jews are well aware that there
was some criminal collaboration with
Nazis. And yet Jews, and non-Jews who
are objective, believe that “the dark-
est chapter of the whole dark story”
of the Nazi period was written by the
Nazis themselves and not by so-called
“Jewish leaders” or collaborators or
anybody else

“The whole truth,” Dr. Arendt pon-
tificates, “was that if the Jewish peo-
ple had really been unorganized and
leaderless, there would have been chaos

23

and plenty of misery but the total num-
ber of victims would hardly have been
between four and a half and six mil-
lion people” (p. 111). (We must note
that in The New Yorker she had writ-
ten “between five and six million”!
Had she just found or saved 500,000
Jews—or is she yielding to neo-Nazi
“statistics” that cut the Jewish losses
lower and lower?)

It is downright perverse for a social
scientist like Dr. Arendt to assume
that millions of Jews could have lived
in compact groups (more or less) in
Europe without organizations and lead-
ers and to ignore the reasons, both
for self-protection and self-fulfilment,
that led the Jews throughout Europe
to organize themselves as Jews.

What disorients Dr. Arendt in this
aspect of her work is her rejection
of “the prosecution’s general picture
of a clear-cut division between per-
secutors and victims” (p. 106). But
by rejecting such a division, she would
rob us o-f the elementary moral per-
ception of -the difference between the
Nazi criminal and ‘his victims. Her
purpose seems to be to demonstrate
“the totality of the moral collapse the
Nazis caused in respectable European
society———not only in Germany but in
almost all countries, not only among
the persecutors but also among the
victims” (p. 111, italics added).

Yes, there was some, perhaps even
much, demoralization among the vic-
tims of the Nazis, including the Jew-
ish victims. To take an ultimate ex-
ample, not noted by Dr. Arendt, there
are -a few authenticated instances o-f
cannibalism in the ghettos. But how
can one speak in the same breath of,
or put on the same moral plane, even
these instances of real cannibalism
among Jewish skeletons maddeningly
starved by the Nazis and the arrogant,
surfei-ted “cannibalism” of the Nazis

24-

themselves? For the demoralized skel-
etal Jewish cannibal, one must have
compassion, but for the Nazi one must
have a hatred whetted by an awareness
of what he drove the Jew to do.

Yet Dr. Arendt’s treatment leads to
no such contrasts or distinctions be-
tween “persecutors and victims” or
between their moral status; So, reflect-
ing ab-out the “moral collapse” caused
by the Nazis, the reviewer in The Chris-
tian Century May 22 exclaims: “And
what about the part the Jews played
in their own destruction through the
willing help they offered the Nazis? If
Eichmann was guilty . . . are not those
Jews also guilty . . .?” And we may
be sure that for the neo-Nazi propa-
gandists half the -battle is won if they
can reduce the Jews to the Nazi moral
plane or elevate the Nazis to the Jew-
ish moral plane by abolishing the di-
vision between persecutor and victim.

Before turning to the role of the
Iudenrat and the question of collab-
oration with the Nazis, we must note
that, -to heighten her “darkest chapter,”
Dr. Arendt uses peculiar methods and
adduces strange evidence indeed. She
would have us believe that the two
mass-murderers of Jews, Reinhard
Heydrich and Hans Frank, are Jews,
Heydrich a. half-Jew and Frank “pro-
bablyjevenia full Jew” (p. 118) ! There
is no evidence offered by Dr. Arendt,
nor is any extant, according to Dr.
Nehemiah Robinson (who also asks
pointedly whether Frank, if he were
a Jew, could have -been appointed Na-
zi Minister of Justice of Bavaria and
then Governor-General of Poland un-
der Nazi occupation).

Then Dr. Arendt becomes both dra-
matic and melodramatic. Noting that
“among the major war criminals, on-
ly two repented in the face of deat ,”
Heydrich and Frank, she grimly faces
reality: “It ‘is an uncomfortable fact,

JEWISH CURRENTS

 

for it is/ difficult not to suspectthat
what they repented of was not murder
but that they had betrayed their own
people” (p. ]19). All we can, say is,
relax, Doctor, your facts are wrong. . .
In another context, in order to show
how uncoordinated Hungarian anti-
Semitism was during the war, Dr.
Arendt asserts that “Hungary was the
only Axis country to send Jewish troops
—130,000 of them, in auxiliary service,
but in Hungarian uniform——~to the
Eastern front” (p. 177, italics added).
Since she cites no source, -the facts had
to be dug out———and we found them
to be not so. A work mentioned in
her bibliography, Jeno Levai’s Black
Book on the Martyrdom of Hungarian
Jewry, Munich, 1948, not only reduces
the figure to 40,000 but says they were
laborers, not uniformed troops. This
is substantiated by a volume published
in Budapest in 1962 by the National
Representation of Hungarian Israeli-
ites, Unarmed in the Mine Fields (in
Hungarian), edited by Elek Karsai.
Here, orders of the Ministry of War
make clear that these Jewish labor,
battalions at the front did not get uni-
forms and photographs show them to
be wearing civilian clothes with yellow
armbands. Incidentally, hardly a few
thousand of the 4-0’-50,000 survived.
So much for Dr. Arendt’s “discovery”
of “Jewish troops” sent by an “Axis
country” to the “Eastern front”!

We have room for only one more
example of distortion of evidence that
leads Dr. Arendt to refer with appar-
ently malicious delight to “Dr. Leo-
Baeck, former Chief Rabbi of Berlin,
who in the eyes of both Jews and Gen-
tiles was the ‘Jewish Fiihrer’ ” (p. 105).
The sole source for this statement turns

‘ out to be her garbling of a phrase by

Raul Hilberg (The Destruction. of the
Jews of Europe, p. 292m), “The Jew-
ish ‘F iiihre-1" in Berlin, as one of Eich-

mann’s people called Rabbi Leo
Baeck. . d”I;I'l]iﬁ) Eichmann man who
so tagcre a i Baeck was Dieter
Wislicehy, later executed in Bratislava
as a war criminal. It is on Wisliceny’s

(who months, and perhaps years, be-
fore end began carefully preparing
an alibi for himself at theexpense of

court at Nuremberg, where he was a
witness for the prosecution . . .).”
Whatwmakes a social scientist accept
a Nazi s evidence when it damages Rab-
 liilaeck a?nd reject it when it damages
ic. mann.

We cannot here evaluate the sub-
stance of her attack on Ra‘b-bi Baeck,
which has been refuted sharply by
Adolf Leschnitzer in Aufbau, New
York, March 29, 1963, but we do want

until, after several imprisonments for
-opposition to the Nazis, he was ex-
pelled from Germany in 1937: “There
was no such thing as Chief Rabbi of
Berlin. Moreover, Baeck was unknown
to ‘the Gentiles,’ and nobody consid-
ered him a ‘Fuhrer’ in the sense Han-
nah Arendt means. to imply . . . yet
in her final opinion,- Baeck was-—-—a
collaborator and traitor. What was
his crime? He thought that Jews, call-
ed into service as police by the Nazis,
would be gentler in their treatment of-
Jews. This was his judgment, arrived
at painfully, and after long and an-
guished deliberation. Hannah Arendt
overlooks his defiance of the Nazis.
She ignores his desperate bravery, his
utter disregard for his own life, and his
noble decision to remain with his peo-
ple. Later, after his detention in the
concentration camp of Theresienstadt,
it was only because of a clerical error

25

 

   

 

  
 

that he was not murdered” (Congress
Bi-Weekly, June 24, 1963). It is ob-
vious that Baeck was tragically wrong
about the Jawish police, but can one
equate error with crime?

Now we turn to the issue of Jewish
collaboration with the Nazis, the
Judenrat and the Jewish police. Rely-
ing on Eichmann’s testimony, Dr. A-
rendt declares: “As Eichmann told it

. of course, he did not expect the
Jews to share the general enthusiasm
over their destruction, but he did ex-
pect more than compliance, he ex-
pected—and received, to a truly ex-
traordinary degree—their cooperation
. . . . Without Jewish help in adminis-
trative and police work . . . there would
have -been either complete chaos or an
impossibly severe drain on German

manpower. Hence, the establishing of

Quisling governments in occupied ter-
ritories was always accompanied by
the organization of a central Jewish
office, and, as we shall see later, where
the Nazis did not succeed in setting u
a puppet government, they also failed
to enlist the cooperation of the Jews.
But whereas the members of the Quis-
ling governments were -usually taken
from the opposition parties, the mem-
bers of the Jewish Councils were as
a rule the locally recognized Jewish
leaders, to whom the Nazis gave e-
normous powers—until they too were
deported, to Theresienstadt or Ber-
gen-Belsen, if they happened to be
from Central or Western Europe, to
Auschwitz if they were from an East-
er-n European community” (pages 103-
104).

To disentangle this skein of exagger-
ation, half-truth, understatement and
misrepresentation is laborious but
necessary. In the ﬁrst place, coopera-
tion with the Nazi occupation forces

was violently exacted by the Nazis.

from every local population they con-

26

quered, with the resistance forces al-
ways in a minority. Thus a survey by
the Royal Institute of International
Affairs in London in 1954 showed that
in France -under Hitler’s occupation,
2,578,000 worked directly, while 1,-
387,000 worked indirectly, for Hitler.
Everyone of these therefore strengthen-
ed the Hitler 'war and destruction
machinery. In regard to police work,
under the Nazi rule there were brutal
police forces carrying out Nazi policy
among the occupied Ukrainian, Lithu-
anian, Polish, Latvian, Dutch, French,
Jewish and other populations, and they
were hated by these populations. We
are therefore dealing with a general
phenomenon of life under the Nazi iron
heel, although there is a distinctive
Jewish feature in that the Jews were
marked -by the Nazis for genocide——
extermination.

Secondly, Dr. Arendt’s remarks on
Quislings are wrong in several respects.
For one, Quisling was a follower of
Hitler politically and ideologically; he
wanted to establish a Nazi regime in
Norway. But no.\ Iudenrat, no matter
how obedient to the Nazi orders, con-
sisted of political and ideological sup-
porters of Hitler; corrupt and evil as
the Judenrat institution was, it was a
Nazi tool, not a Nazi ideological part-
ner or follower. For another, Dr. A-
rendt errs in asserting that there were
Judenrats only where there were Quits-
ling governments—in Poland, there
were Judenrats -but no puppet govern-
ment as a whole, the Nazis preferring
to rule directly.

Then again, Dr. Arendt is wrong in
describing the Iudenrat personnel as
consisting usually of “the locally re-
cognized Jewish leaders,” if by leaders
she means officials of pre-war Jewish
organizations. Paul Novick in the
Morning F reheit Aug. 18 pointed out
that from his studies he has concluded

JEWISH CURRENTS ‘

 

that “with the exception perhaps of
smaller cities and towns [in Eastern
Europe] (such as Radom. . .), the
Judenrat personnel had not been Jew-
ish leaders before the war.” Many of
the old leaders had ﬂed the Nazis or
were killed by them. Some remained to
form counterforces to the Iudenrat,
busying themselves with mutual aid
in the misery-ridden ghettos or with
communal, cultural and educational
pursuits not sanctioned by the Nazis
or the Judenrat. For Dr. Arendt there-
fore to lump all former leaders into
one pressure-cooker of collaboration-
ists is quite misleading.

A book should be written that would
objectively summarize the conditions
in every ghetto, concentration camp and
death-camp, in every city occupied by
the Nazis; that would describe the Nazi
system of terror and deception in pre-
paration for extermination; that would
depict Jewish life and Jewish organ-
izations, including the Iuclenrat, and
their functioning; that would also
describe the forms and organs of re-
sistance that developed. Dr. Arendt’s
unfounded generalizations point up the
need for such a study.

Now some critics of Dr. Arendt,
properly outraged by the main effect
of her book b-ut ﬂailing at her with
whatever weapon lay at hand, have
virtually slipped into a defense of the
Iuclenrat, “understanding” the ]uden-
rat leaders to the point practically of
justifying them on the grounds almost
of “what could they do but take
orders.’ ” Such an approach is danger-
ous because it confuses our under-
standing of the past and therefore
hinders our attaining clarity on how
to prevent a recurrence.

For what was the Judenrat as an
institution, apart from both the sub-
jective intentions of some of its leaders
and the occasional instance in which,

Ocroman, 1963

as in Minsk, it “was most intimately
bound up with the resistance move-
ment” (Hersh Smoliar, a leader of the
Minsk resistance, in Jewish Currents,
April, 1959)?

The answer has been given by Ber
Mark, director of the Jewish Histor-
ical Institute of Warsaw, in The Revolt
in the Bialystok Ghetto (in Yid‘-dish,
1950): “This institution can in no
wise bear the Yiddish designation
Yidenrat . . . but must be called by
the German name, Iudenrat, since it
was an org-an which was not in any
degree elected or appointed by Jews,
nor did it express the opinions of the
Jewish community It was purely an
institution established by and for the
occupying power. It is therefore in-
correct to describe the situation . .
as one in which the Jews entrusted
their security to the Judenrat, which
only betrayed its trust. The truth is
that the people—in Bialystok and
everywhere else—did not trust or re-
spect the Judenrat” (Jewish Life, April,
1952; incidentally, of 12 members of
the Bialystok ludenrat only ﬁve had
been Jewish leaders before the war).

“The enormous powers” with which
Dr. Arendt would have us believe the
Nazis endowed the Judenrat were a
parody of power, consisting only of
the “power” to do the Nazi -bidding
no matter what the enormity of that
bidding. In doing this bid.ding, it
should also -be remembered, the ]ud'en-
rat reflected its class character as re-
presenting the wealthy Jews. Emmanuel
Ringelblum, left-Labor-Zionist histori-
an and archivist of the Warsaw Ghetto,
continually points to this fact. “The
beastly nature of the Jewish bourg-
eoisie,” he noted in his famous Diary,
Jan., 1942, “its cannibalistic quality,
found -unmistakable expression in the
recent days of hunger. The entire activ-
ity of the Kehilla Uutlenrat] is a

shocking wrong against the poor”

27

  
  

(Jewish Life, April, 1953). After the
Judenrat and the Jewish police rounded
up 1,500 Jews to be sent-to a “labor
camp” in April, 1941, “the Jewish
popul.ace°s wrath at the ,/urlenrat was
indescribable,” Ringelblum recorded.

The Jewish police were particular-
ly vicious and particularly hated. “The
cruelty of the Jewish police often out-
did that of the Germans and Ukraini-
ans and Latvians,” Ringelblum wrote
in Nov., 1942. As a result, when the
resistance really got organized, it car-
ried through the execution of some of
the worst of the Jewish police and
gestapo agents.

These on the spot judgments a-re
reinforced by those made 10 or 20
years later by survivors of experiences
with the Judenrat and the Jewish
police. Thus Izhak Zuckerman (Antek) ,

one of the commanders of the Warsaw‘

Ghetto Uprising, writing 10 years after
the event, concludes: “There were
groups that cooperated with the Ger-
man: the police, the Judenrat. . . I am
not of the opinion that all those who
took part in these groups were traitors
and that all those who participated
in thesse activities were concerned only
ab-out their own safety. And neither
do I believe that all those who cooper-
ated with these institutions were mo-
tivated by malice. But from a strictly
objective point of view, all these in-
stitutions were converted into instru-
ments of evil. . . Leading all was the
Judenrat. . .” (in The Fighting Ghet-
tos, ed. by Meyer Barkai from the
Hebrew published in Tel Aviv, 1954,
Lippincott, N.Y., 1962, p. 6, italics
added).

Another survivor, Michael Mirsky,
living in Poland now, wrote a play,
Der Heshbn (The Sum Total), which
was staged by the Polish State Yiddish
Theater as part of the 20th anniversary
commemoration of the Warsaw Ghetto

28

Uprising. Discussing the play, the War-
saw Fol/cshtimme May 21 praises
Mirsky’s avoidance of schematicism in
his depiction of the Ghet-to- forces,
and adds: “This play has a character
who is very complicated: the chairman
of the Judenrat, Daniel Marshak, a
tragic ﬁgure. The author simpliﬁes
nothing here. He condemns Marshak’s
activity; he shows that it was pro-
foundly wrong and did not bring the
results aimed at by Marshak, since
it simply made it easier for the Ger-
mans to carry out their shameful task.
But the dramatist perceives the subjec-
tively honorable intentions of Marshak,
who lives under the illusion that in
this way he will be able to rescue
from death at least a part of the
Ghetto inhabitants. Only at the very
end of the play does M-arshak realize
how tragic was his mistake.”

In our view, Zuckerman and Mirsky
are both sound in their judgment, in
which the passage of time has round-
ed out their original perceptions, so
that their moral firmness is not under-
mined by their evaluation of good but
unrealized subjective intentions. To
discount the subjective factors is to
fail to understand how even well-in-
tentioned people could be deceived by
the Nazis and is therefore to be super-
ﬁcially —— and unbearably —— righteous.
But to discount the objective evil re-
sults is to whitewash the practice of
collaboration with the Nazis, either in
destroying others or in -destroying your
own people. We reject such tendencies
to whitewash the Iudenrat institution
that have unfortunately appeared in
some defensive and apologetic rebut-
tals of the Arendt thesis.

For what is wrong with the Arendt
picture is not that it includes what
is surely no discovery of hers, the
evil of the ./udenrat and the‘ Jewish

police. Her error lies in her gross

JEWISH CURRENTS

 

 

exaggeration of the meaning and the
“eight of this collaboration in the
process of destroying six million Jews.
She, who mu-sters ‘such “insight” to
lind l7.ichmann simply ordinary and
banal, to use her favorite words, never-
theless concludes that the Jews, some-
how, were extraordinary, at least that
they cooperated with Eichmann “to a
truly extraordinary degree” in their
own destruction.

She would have.us accept the theo-
ry that the Judenrat and Jewish col-
laboration were indispensable in this
process, that without the Iudenrat there
could have -been no such destruction
but simply “plenty of chaos and mis-
ery.” She makes an astounding equa-
tion: where there was no Iudenrat
there was no destruction—and she
offers Belgium as an example. But
an examination of the Belgian situation
reveals both her ignorance and her
strange ways with evidence. Dr. Arendt
reports that in 1951 there were 50,000
Jews there, of whom only 5,000 were
Belgian-born citizens. “All the more
important Jewish leaders” having ﬂed,
sly: jubilates, “there was no Jewish
Council to register the Jews———one of
the more important prerequisites for
their seizure.”

So what happened in this fortu-
nate situation? “Not a single Belgian
Jew was ever deported.” And of the
45,000 “st-ateless Jews” in Belgium?
Oh, well, only 25,000 were rounded up,
shipped to Auschwitz and had been
killed by the fall of 1944! So: only
half the Jews of Belgium were exter-
minated in a West European country
in which the Jews were not put in a
ghetto by the Germans, and the reason
for such a low percentage of destruc-
tion, we are asked to believe, is that
there was no Iwderat ‘to register the
Jews!

But the fact is that in 1941 the Nazis

OCTOBER, 1963

did ' form a Judenrat, the Association
of Jews in Belgium. And the percentage
of Jews killed in Belgium had less to
do with the existence of the Judenrat
that it did with the fact that, as Dr.
Arendt notes on the same page, “The
Belgian police did not cooperate with
the Germans, and the Belgian railway-
men could not even be trusted to leave
deportation trains alone. They con-
trived to leave doors unlocked or to
arrange am-bushes, so that Jews could
escape” (p. 150).

Two things are noteworthy: that
even without lists drawn up by a
Iudenrat, the Germans themselves were
able-in Belgium to round up 25,000
out of 45,000 stateless Jews and rail-
road them to their death; that non-
co-operation by the Belgian police and
sabotage by the Belgian railwaymen
made the German task more difficult.
In this situation the attitude of the
local population seems more weighty
than the existence of a Iudenrat.

In a frequently perceptive essay
on Dr. Arendt’s book in Commentary
(Sept) , its editor, Norman Podhoretz,
cites Leon Poliakov’s comment on the
French ]udenrat’s role: “In France
you never had a situation where Jews
were systematically presiding over the
deportation of other Jews.” And the
reason given by Po-liakov is illumin-
ating: “the attitude of the French
population, which strenuously opposed
the policy of segregation and isolation
of the Jews, made such degradation
impossible.” It would therefore seem
that one must examine the speciﬁc
climates of resistance and‘ collaboration
in each of the Nazi occupied countries
in order to obtain a focused picture
of the Jewish situation. Dr. Arendt
has not made such an examination
and therefore has no evidence to justify
her charge that Jewish collaboration
was any more extensive or “extra-

An examination of a controversial
book on the Eichmann case

HEN Eichmann was executed
May 31, 1962, the concensus
of opinion was that Israel had ren-
dered a signal service to the cause of
justice. Despite some pre-trial con-
troversy and misgivings in some quar-
ters, the trial itself was widely recog-
nized, even by many original critics
and sceptics, as eminently fair. At a
time when the Nazi international was
conspicuously rearin.g its head, stag-
ing the trial was itself a blow to
Nazism and neo-Nazism. We re-
peated our call (in our Sept, 1962
issue) for a movement to help make
the world Nazirein. by -bringing to
similar justice all the Nazi war crimi-
nals still unpunished (scores of whom,
including Clobke, had been named by
the prosecution and its witnesses) in
West Germany, Latin America, the
Middle East, Spain and the United
States; We also pointed out, last Sept.,
that there was an attempt already
under way to whitewash Eichmann
and discredit the trial, a Prof. Paul
Rassinier having already issued a
lying book on the subject in France
and lectured in this wise in 12 West
German cities (as reported in The
Nation, July 14, 1962).

Part of the struggle to make the
world Navzirein requires, therefore,
that we keep the record of the Eich-
mann trial clear and in proper focus.
In this context, Hannah Arendt’s
widely discussed book, Eichmann in

J ULY-AUGUST, 1963

Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality
of Evil (Viking, N. Y., 1963, 275
pages, $5.50—serialized in The New
Yorker, Feb. 16-March 16 “in slightly
abbreviated and otherwise slightly
different form,” as the book-publishers
say), is destructive, mischievous and
pernicious.

Part of the problem lies in the fact
that the English reader does not yet
have available in our country the doc-
uments necessary to an extensive
study of the trial. So far as we know,
no commercial puiblisher, no univer-
sity press and no foundation has be-
gun to publish the trial record (as has
been done for the Nuremberg Trials).
The Jerusalem Post in Israel in June,
1961 fortunately issued a volume in
English of 316 pages containing the
indictment, the text of the Prosecutor’s
great panoramic Opening Address,
the full record of the Defense’s objec-
tions on the question of jurisdiction
with the Prosecution’s reply and the
Court’s decision on this point, the
arraignment of the defendant and the
Law under which he was being tried.
Even this volume has not been pub-
lished in the United States.

Apart from the extensive newspaper
coverage of the trial, we have had
two books. With the trial having ended
Aug. 14, 1961, there appeared Sept.
18 the newsman Dewey W. Linze’s ac-
count, The Trial of Adolph Eichmann,
a paperback issued by Holloway in

ordinary” than that of other occupied
peoples.

Furthermore, Dr. Aren»dt’s statement »

that lack of Jewish cooperation might
have resulted in “an impossibly severe
drain on German manpower” can only
mean that" the Germans might have
had to give up the “Final Solution”
of exterminating the Jews——which is
nonsense. For Dr. Arendt knows very
well that the “Final Solution” was a
ﬁxed goal, to which other Nazi
poli-cies were subordinated so that in
the last year of the war Auschwitz
crematoria were functioning at their
full hellish blast alth-ough this opera-
tion w.as withholding material required
at the Nazi fronts. Only maj-or inter-
vention by the Allied and neutral
powers could have forced the Nazis
to abandon the policy of the “Final

Solution,” just as only signiﬁcant

government action, such as the evacu-
ation eastward of large numbers of
Jews by Soviet agencies, could exten-
sively interfere with the extent to which
the “Final Solution” was carried out.
But Jewish collaboration with the
Nazis was criminal because it facil-
itated, not because it made possible,
the slaughter of the six million.

Before turning from‘ the subject of
Jewish collaboration to Jewish re-
sistance, we cannot refrain from a
necessarily too brief comment on one
aspect, Dr. Arendt’s picture of re-
lations between Zionists an-d Nazis,
which is no more objective than any
other part of her canvas. Since Dr.
Arendt is, so to speak, an ex-Zionist,
one is -tempted to remark that ap-
parcntly one can no more trust the
objectivity of an ex-Zionist than of
a-n ex4C.ommunist or ex-Catholic.
Zionists, notably Marie Syrkin in the
May Jewish Frontier, have already
exposed some of Dr. Arendt’s manipu-
ation of evidence on this subject, Dr.
Arendt herself distinguishes between

30

“a certain amount of non—cri1niual co-
operation with the Nazi authorities”
(p. 54-) in the early years and some
later criminal acts such as in the Kast-
ner case. There is need to review the
whole record objectively. Anti-Zionists
and non-Zionists should be careful,
however, to be objective in their evalu-
ations. Our own opposition to the polit-
ical theory and practice of Zionism
leads us to warn that any Zionazi syn-
drome is as false and misleading as the
communazi syndrome which is ac-
cepted by so many, including so many
Zionists, and by Dr. Arendt herself.
(We should also; add “social-fascist”
as a harmful syndrome.)

F Dr. Arendt’s view of Jewish re-
sistance, we may say that it would
not loom so small if the theme of
collaboration had not loomed so large.
She repeats the “lambs to the slaugh-
ter” thesis (,p. 3) but asserts in passing
what she and her readers promptly
proceed -to forget—that “no non-Jewish
group or people had behaved differ-
ently” (p. 9). Mainly she seems un-
informed, not having taken the trouble
to consider t-he available evidence.

Dr. Arendt offers us the image of
the Jew in World War II as a helpless
and contented coward‘, This is so
patently false that one marvels at the
gullibility of those who accept this
image. A recent tabulation shows that
the Jews fought literally on all fronts:
In the Polish army in 1939 there were
150,000 Jews (over 32,000 were kill-
ed, 61,000 taken prisoner) ; in the
Soviet armed forces t-here were over
500,000 Jews, of whom some 200,000
were killed in action; in the U.S. forces
there were over 550,000‘ Jews; there
were 62,000 Jews in the British armies
and another 26,000 in the Common-
wealth forces; the Palestinian Jewish
Brigade, when the British ﬁnally al-
lowed it to be formed, had 26,000‘; and

JEWISH CURRENTS

 

so on (compilation in Hebrew by ‘the
Association of War Invalids in Israel
and the Yad Vashem, Tel Aviv, 1961.
cited in the London Zionist Jewish
Observer and Middle East Review,

‘Jan. 12, 1962). And until all govern-

ments involved make suitable inves-
tigations into the number of Jews
ﬁghting in their partisan and under-
gro-und units no su-ch compilation can
be complete.

Dr. Arendt unfortunately has gulp-
ed with satisfaction the spurious thesis
of Raul Hilberg about the alleged
passivity of the Jews under Nazi domin-
ation, despite such adequate rebuttals
as those of Ber Mark (see our April,
1962 issue, and the preceding discus-
sion which it climaxed). Worse, in
The New Yorker Dr. Arendt gave the
Hilberg theory a mass currency it had
not before attained. There is no need
here to repeat the rebuttal, b-ut we
believe some elementary distin-ctions
are needed.

The resistance of the Jews, and of
all others -under Nazi occupation, was
of two kinds, defensive and offensive.
The defensive resistance aimed at per-
sonal survival, and included methods
like hiding, smuggling food, bribery of
the Nazis, forging false documents,

and in other ways continuing to do ,

those things the Nazis had forbidden.
This defensive resistance was general,
widespread and a mass phenomenon.
Beca-use it went counter to the will
and plan of -the enemy, this attitude
and action must be included as resist-
ance.

The offensive resistsance was aimed
at doing damage to the Nazi enemy
(sometimes connected with an ideal
of group and even personal survival)
by various forms of sabotage and, as
arms became available, in armed re-

. sistance. This offensive resistance was

always conducted by organized minor-

Ot:'r0nER_, 1.963

ities, whose effectiveness was always
multiplied by uniﬁcation.

One must also take into account the
locale of the resistance. ‘That which
was organized on national territories
(France, Holland, Belgium, parts of
the Soviet Union) had obvious advan-
tages, not to be minimized, over that

which was organized in ghettos set up’

by the Nazis for the express purpose
of isolating the Jews as a step to their
annihilation. The ghettos were sur-
rounded by non-Jewish populations in
which at best only a minority would
risk helping Jews and at worst a major-
ity would be more or less actively
hostile.

In this context, then, consider the
fact that, in 1943 alone, the Jews
staged armed actions not only in War-
saw but in the ghettos of Bialystok,
Czenstochow, Bendin and Tarnow, in

the death-camps of Treblinka and Poni-

atow and in the partisan bands operat- .

ing in the Lublin, Bialystok, Warsaw,
Crakow, Kielc, Czenstochow and
Lvov regions.

Now even though the offensive re-
sistance was conducted by small groups,
when one becomes aware of the extent
of the resistance, one must echo Gideon
Hausner’s exclamation  his Opening
Address at the Eichmann trial: “The
great wonder wasthat after years of
oppression, degradation and hunger,
the Jews found spiritual strength for
all these instances of revolt and re-
sistance, in face of the mighty Gestapo
machine and its deadly power of de-
struction on the one hand, and—on the
other——the Nazis’ trickery, deception
and concealment of their intention to
exterminate th)e Jews” (6,000,000 Ac-
cusers, p. 108 .

Yet, as we learn more and more
about the real extent of the offensive
resistance, we may still ask, was there
“enough” resistance? The answer is,
“No.” Could there have been more

31

 

  
  

offensive resistance? “Yes.” Why was
there not more?

Not enough attention ‘has been
paid to the fact that the Nazis did
not rule by terror alone, that cunning
and deception were among the main
instruments of Nazi genocide. As I
wrote 15 years ago, “They fostered
every possible illusion to prevent that
-stage of disillusionment that might be-
come the prelude to an attitude of re-
sistance” (Resistance Is the Lesson,
pamphlet, available for a stamped,
self-addressed envelope).

The Nazis spread the illusion that
the Ghetto was a kind of “Jewish
state,” with a Jewish Council, Jewish
police with Star-of-David badges, street
cars with Bl-ue-and-White Stars of
David and similar parodies of a Jewish
paradise. The Nazis encouraged the
illusion that by Jewish education and

culture disconnected from resistance,

Jews could somehow survive. The
Nazis fostered the illusion that they
would send Jews to Palestine and, de-
spite warnings by the underground
Resistance, thousands were deluded to
register to go -to Palestine—thus pro-
viding lists for the death-trains.

And those who from the beginning
preached offensive resistance, who
exposed the illusions, were denounced
by the Nazis and -their Jewish echoes
as alarmisats, as reds. There has been
too much ignoring of the part that
anti-communism and anti-Sovietism
played in the Nazi arsenal of deception
and delusion. There were Jews who,
having escaped from Poland into the
Soviet Union, were persuaded by their
relatives back home to return to the
Warsaw ghetto because it had, you
see, a Jewish Council (Iudenrat) I And
when in Oct., 1941 the news arrived
in the Warsaw ghetto of the mass
executions in the Vilna ghetto, the
Warsaw Jews were “reassured” by the
interpretation that “the slaughter

32

should be interpreted as an anti-com-
munist rather than as an anti-Jewish
act.”

Recently Zivia Lubetkin, a heroine
of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising now in
Israel (and one of the witnesses at
the Eichmann trial whose testsimony
the so-hard-rto-please Dr. Arendt ad-
mired), cast light on why the Warsaw
Jews were so ina-dequa-tely armed. In
a 20th Anniversary issue of Folk un
Zion, published by the Jewish Agency
in Jerusalem, she cited a letter of
:her husband, the resistance leader
Itzhak Zuckerman, who had been try-
ing to persuade the Armia Krayova,
the underground army of the Polish
Government-in-Exile in London, to
give arms to the Warsaw Ghetto
Fighting Organization. On the very
eve of the Uprising, she wrote, this
Polish undeground “wanted, at all
costs -to avoid an armed clash with
the Germans. They preferred to save
their weapons and their manpower for
a contest against the red menace. They
were afraid that the Jewish uprising in
the Ghetto would arouse the Polish
masses to actions against the Germans.”
Thus this anti-Sovietism literally helped
disarm the resistance heroes.

Of such complexitiess Dr. Arendt is-
studiously unaware, although other-
wise she dotes on complexity. There-
fore her book can in no way help us
free ourselves of the illusions that neo-
Nazis are spreading today. Though she
is herself subjectively deeply anti-
Nazi, her book confuses issues and
makes it harder to make -the world
Nazirein. She who is so given to in-
tellectual paradox, to turning things
inside out, -to “proving” that Eichmann
is no monster and no anti-Semite,
might well reflect how she betrayed
her own intentions, how she out-
smai‘-ted herself, how she wrote a book
it would be charitable to hope she will
live to regret—and to live down.

Los Angeles. In Jan., 1963, Knopf in
New York published The Record: The
Trial of Adolph Eichmann for His
Crimes Against the Jewish People and
Against Humanity (388 pages, $5.95) ,
by Lord Russell of Liverpool, who as
First Deputy Judge Advocate General
of the British First Army had served
as legal adviser at the Nuremberg
Trials and who had covered the Eich-
mann trial. Completed a few days after
the sentencing on Dec. 15, 1961, Lord
Russell’s volume is a very “useful digest
of the entire proceedings up to Eich-
mann’s appeal to the Israeli highest
court (it is regrettable that a year
later the American publisher issued
the book without updating it to include
that court’s judgment).

R. ARENDT’S book is of another
type. Although she covered the
trial for The New Yorker she did so
not as a journalist or lawyer but as a
social and political philosopher and
moralist, Born and educated in Ger-
many (with a Heidelberg Ph.D.), she
has -become an inﬂuential intellectual
in our country, with books on the
origins of totalitarianism, the human
condition and revolution and with
teaching posts in some of our most
prominent universities. (For her re-
lation to Jewish affairs, see the "box
on the next page.) The lofty, “show-
me” mood in which she approached
the trial is suggested by her self-de-
scription as one of those “who knew
by heart all there was to know, and
who were in no mood to learn any
lessons and certainly did not need this
trial to draw their own conclusions”
(p. 6).

Yet despite her reputation and qual-
iﬁcations, we found the book not only
full of questionable and already de-
bated judgments, and of interpreta-
tions that seem quite distorted, but

4

also so liberally sprinkled with factual
errors, both gross an-d petty, that we
soon grew sceptical. Although she
pretends to authority, she generally
disdains documentation and citation
of sources, thus compounding the diffi-
culty of checking on her assertions.
Two examples of gross error on mat-
ters perhaps not central to her main
themes will indicate the problem the
reader faces.

A close look at two paragraphs on
pages 33-34 shows the following: We
are told that in 1935 “Hitler was ad-
mired everywhere as a great national
statesman.” Now in The New Yorker
she had written “almost everywhere,”
and then struck out the “almost,” but
can anyone who remembers the anti-
Nazi demonstrations in 1935 in the

USA, Britain and rance (as well as

many other countries) accept either
of Dr, Arendt’s versions?

Then she continues: “Because of the
enormous rearmament program, un-
employment had been liquidated, the
initial resistance of the working class
was ,broken, and the hostility of the
regime, which had at first been di-
rected primarily against ‘anti-Fascists’
—Communists, Socialists, left-wing
intellectuals and Jews in prominent
position.s——had not yet shifted entirely
to persecution of the Jews qua Jews.”
liirst, unemployment in Germany had
not been liquidated in 1935, as can
be seen from Robert Henri’s articles
in 1936 in the London New Statesman
and Nation, exposing this fallacy
(cited by Charles R. Allen, Jr. in his
review of Shirer’s book in our Sept,
1961 issue).

Secondly, we were disturbed by the
remarkable blandness with which Dr.
Arendt spoke of the breaking of the
workers resistance, because we re-

DR. ARENDT ON HER CONNECTION WITH ZIONISM

“Before I left Germany in 1933, I had been very friendly with a
number of Zionists, without being a Zionist and without belonging
to the organization. I was not interested in politics, but I deﬁnitely
sympathized with their point of view. In May, 1933, if I remember
correctly (after Hitler’s rise to power), the Zionist organization ap-
proached me to do some ‘illegal’ work: to collect data on official anti-
Semitism. This could be done only by somebody who was not a
member of the organization -since otherwise, in case of arrest, the
existence of the organization would have been put into jeopardy. I
accepted gladly and, alas, was arrested with a beautiful collection.
After that, I had to leave Germany illegally and rather in a hurry. I
went to Paris. I now began to take part in the Zionist organization
as a social worker among Jewish refugees. From 1935 onwards, I
was ‘secretaire generale’ of Youth Aliyah, hence an employee of the
Jewish Agency. I remained in close contact with them up to the out-
break of the war. I came to America in 1941, and during my first
two years here, I wrote a column for the German-Jewish newspaper,
Aufbau, chiefly about the need for a Jewish Army. I left the Zionist
organization in 1943 after the Biltmore Conference, but without raising
a fuss, quietly. My reason: treatment of -the Arab question. A few
years later I wrote a lengthy article published in Menorah under the
title ‘Zionism Reconsidered.’ In 1948, Judah Magnes—American rabbi
and Zionist leader—came from Jerusalem to America and asked me to
help him in forming an inner-Zionist opposition to the oﬂicial Zionist
policy. I a-greed and worked with him for about six months—'until
his death. From 1949 to 1952, I was Executive Secretary of Jewish
Cultural Reconstruction, an American organization that collected and
redistributed cultural objects found in Germany. Since then, I have had
no oﬂicial contact with the Jewish world.”

rors. What can we think when we note
that in The New Yorker Dr. Arendt

had written “aggressions of the re-

gime” but in the book had toned it

down to “hostility of the regime”?
Such blandness blinds.

On the errors in her next paragraph
we shall save space by quoting from
a review by Dr. Nehemiah Robinson,
director of the Institute of Jewish
Affairs of the World Jewish Congress:

“It is not true . . . that ‘private busi-

JULY-AUGUST, 1963

ness and the legal and medical profes-
sions were not touched until 1938.’
In fact, by April, -1937 over 1,320
Jewish lawyers were disbarred, over
1,160 notaries lost their licenses; soon
physicians and dentists were excluded
from public sick funds (Kranken-
kassen) and under pressure of the
Nazi Party, the Aryan paragraph was
extended to industry and commerce,
not to speak of the total exclusion
from the (private) press. Her state-

5

  

ment about emigration [proceeding
‘in a not unduly accelerated and gen
erally orderly fashion’] disregarded
that between 1933 and 1937, about
135,000 Jews left Germany (not
counting foreigners). Arendt’s conten-
tion that until the Nov., 1938 Crystal
Night there were only individual ac-
tions putting Jews under pressure to
sell their businesses and real estate
at low prices and that they usually
occurred in small towns only, is at
variance with the extensive Aryaniza-

tion all over Germany. Since 1933

Jews were excluded not only from
taking examinations for academic
professions but, except for a few, also
from all institutions of higher learn-
ing.”

Our second example is this state-
ment: “It was not until the outbreak
of the war, on Sept. 1, 1939, that the
Nazi regime became openly totalitar-
ian and openly criminal.” Can this
mean that all the crimes against hun-
dreds of thousands if not millions of
Germans, as well as Hitler’s crimes
against Spain, Austria and Czechoslo'-
vakia had not been “open” or “totali-
tarian” or what? Precision of lan-
guage, as we shall see in many other
instances, is not one of Dr. Arendt’s
notable qualities.

Yet let us not, amid a polemic
controversy, fail to give Dr. Arendt
her due. She is anti-Nazi, deeply so.
She has no doubt about Eichmann’s
guilt. She agrees he should have been
executed (but she appends her own
better speech, she thinks, than the
Court made in sentencing him and
explaining why). She has no use for
the Adenauer regime, with its Nazi
criminals in public office (p. 15), its
Nazi judges (p. 13), its “fantastically
lenient sentences” for Nazis convicted
of horrendous crimes (pages 12, 13,

6

166-167), the fake “innocent” attitude
to Nazism of Franz-Joseph Strauss and
other West German leaders (p. 53), or
the phoniness of publicized “guilt-
feelings” in West Germany while the
guilt-feelers do nothing about Nazis in
positions of authority (p. 229). She
notes “the moral debacle of a whole
[German] nation” (p. 97 ) . She knows
the connection between the Einsatz-
gruppen (extermination squads on the
Eastern front) and the Wehrmacht,
which Heusinger has tried to hide
(p. 94-). She would like to teach us
all to avoid genocide in the future as
the population exp osions plus auto-
mation create superfluous populations
that could be exterminated easily by
nuclear weapons (p. 250). Finally, the
book has raised, with a large audi-
ence, some proper questions even if
in a false way and may precipitate
public discussion that may clarify
these issues.

CENTRAL in her study is her de-
piction of Eichmann, whom, in
her modest opinion, neither the prose-
cution nor the judges (nor the specta-
tors, nor the pu-blic nor the world) has
understood. We shall try faithfully to
summarize her view—and comment as
we go along.

First, we are assured over and over
again that Eichmann is not a “mon-
ster”—and as an example of a mon-
ster Dr. Arendt cites Bluebeard (p.
253)! (Dr. Bruno Bettelheim, one of
her most favorable and adroit inter-
preters, hastens to explain, in his
review in The New Republic, June
15, that a monster “Eichman certainly
was, but as part of a monstrous sys-
tem; as a man, he was blatantly not.”)
To Dr. Arendt, Eichmann is “terribly
and terrifyingly normal” (p. 253). He
“commits his crimes under circum-
stances that make it well-nigh impos-

JEWISH CURRENTS

 

 

sible for him to know or to feel that
he is doing wrong” (p. 250). The
prosecutor and the judges all missed
what is to her “the greatest moral and
even legal challenge of the whole
case” (p. 23——a formulation that she
discovered after The New Yorker ap-
peared, since she added it in the

book) : “that an average ‘normal’ per-.

son, neither feeble-minded nor indoc-
trinated nor cynical could be perfectly
incapable of telling right from wrong”
(p. 23). (In the United States, we
may add, a person who cannot tell
right from wrong cannot be brought
to trial, and is usually adjudged in-
sane.)

Thus, Dr. Arendt asserts, “the ques-
tion uppermost in the minds of nearly
everyone who followed the trial—of
whether the accused had a conscience”
(p. 89) was answered. (We record
herein that this question was far from
uppermost in our mind.) Since “it
was of great political interest to know
how long it takes an average person
to overcome his innate repugnance
toward crime, and what exactly hap-
pens to him once he has reached that
point,” Dr. Arendt found Eichmann
supplying “an answer that co-uld not
have been clearer and more precise”
(pages 87-88). The answer is, “yes,
he had a conscience, and his con-
science functioned in the expected
way for about four weeks, whereopon
it began to function the other way
around” (p. 89). In The New Yorker
it was three weeks and our press dead-
line has prevented our independent
calculation to see which if either, is
right.

So, Eichmann is Everyman—- and
Everyman can be an Eichmann. These
days this passes for “insight,” which
it might well be if it were coupled
with a program to prevent Everynian
from allowing Nazism to come to

JULY-AUcUs-r, 1963

power, or to join the Nazi Party even
before’ it does, as Eichmann did.

Now this ordinary shnook Eich-
mann had some not uncommon fail-
ings. He bragged a lot and he had a
very bad memory. “Bragging was . . .
Eichmann’s undoing” (p. 4-1), It
was “preposterous” of him to ‘brag,
“I will jump into my grave laughing,
because the fact that I have the death
of ﬁve million Jews . . . on my con-
science gives me extraordinary satis-
faction,” but “he had kept repeating
the damning sentence ad nauseam to
everyone who would listen, even 12
years later in Argentina” (p. 42). We
really wonder: would Everyman brag
about such a deed? did in fact Every-
nazi make such boasts? or can it -be
that this normal Eichmann had the
un-Nazi habit of bragging? Can this
be what expounders of Dr. Arendt’s
ideas (and she has loyal ones) mean
when they say happily that she is pro-
vocative of thought?

As for Eichmann’s “extraordinarily
faulty memory” (pages 4-9, 56, 57, 79,
88, 93, 183), it was really a handicap
in his defense, and Dr. Arendt does
not weary of reminding him (post-
humously) of what he could have said
in the Jerusalem courtroom if he had
only not forgotten so much!

But bragging and a bad memory
were not so decisive after all, says
Dr. Arendt (although one of them was
his “undoing,” which sounds decisive
until you begin to roll with Dr.
Arendt’s imprecisions). She explains
that a less common but “a more spe-
ciﬁc, and also more decisive, flaw in
Eichmann’s character was his almost
total inability ever to look at anything
from the other fellow’s point of view”
(p. 43). Her example of this “deci-
sive llaw” is strange indeed: From

7

  

March, 1938 Eichmann had been in
charge of the “forced emigration” of
Vienna’s Jews; in 18 months, he had
expelled 150,000 Jews, half the Jews
of Vienna. At the trial he- insisted,
even under cross-examination, he had
“helped” the Jews and that the Jews
and he were “pulling together,” since
there was a happy coincidence of the
Reich desire to become judenrein and
the Jews’ “desire” to emigrate. This
is what Dr.Arendt means by “his total
ina:bility ever to look at anything

from the other fellow’s point of view”!

A more normal description of such.

testimony is that given by the Court
in its Judgment: “His entire testimony
was nothing but one consistent at-
tetrpt ta deny the truth and to con-
ceal his real share of the responsibil-
ity, or at least to reduce it to a mini-
mum. . . he did not have the courage
to tell the truth either about what
actually happened or about his inner-
most feelings about what he did. We
saw him, again and again, twisting
and turning under the impact of the
cross-_ex.amination, retreating from
complete to partial denial and only,
when left with no alternative, admit-
ting anything, but always, of course,
taking refuge in the plea that in all
matters great or small he was acting
on explicit orders” (Lord Russell,
work cited, p. 338).

Another feature in Dr. Arendt’s
portrait of Eichmann is that “his was
obviously also no case . . . of fanatical
anti-Semitism or indoctrination of any
kind” (p. 23). She accepts his pro-
testation that he “had no hatred for
Jews” (p.26). The fact that “he had
hoped to be nominated for the Einsatz-
gruppen, the mobile -killing units in
the East . . . in March, 1941” (p. 45),
she blinks away as not evidence of
“fanaticism.” She does not mention the

8

fact that Kurt Becher, a witness for
the defense, testiﬁed that “Eichmann
was a convinced National Socialist and
a fanatical anti-Semite” (Lord Rus-
sell, work cited, p. 251), but she char-
acterizes Becher. as “an old enemy of
Eichmann” (p. 126) and may be
willing to credit testimony only of
his friends.

Now Pastor Heinrich Gruber, a Ger-
man Lutheran minister who testified
for the prosecution, had also told the
Court that he “and his friends were
always trying to ﬁnd an acceptable
explanation of Eichmann’s rabid and
boundless hatred of the Jews” (Lord
Russell, work cited, p. 211), but Dr.
Arendt dismisses Dr. Gruber’s descrip-
tions of Eichmann as those of a man
not “a particularly good psychologist”
and affirms that such interpretations
“would normally have been striken
from any court record” (p. 116), so
she strikes them from her mind and
is left with a non-fanatical, non-anti-
Semitic Eichmann.

But Dr. Arendt uneasily returns to
the problem, particularly when she
declares “That Eichmann had at all
times done his «best to make the Final
Solution ﬁnal was therefore not in
dispute” (p. 130). Now “the judges,
who tried so hard to understand the
accused,” for some odd reason thought
“this was indeed proof of his fanati-
cism, his boundless hatred of Jews”
(p. 130). But Dr. Arendt knows better
and does not hesitate to tell these
really so hard-working and sincere
judges that “it was not his fanaticism
but his very conscience that prompted
Eichmann to adopt his uncompromis-
ing attitude during the last year of
the war, as it had prompted him to
move in the opposite direction for a
short time three years before” (p.
131). If this is not convincing, Dr.
Arendt painstakingly explains again

that what was “involved was not fa-
naticism, it was his genuine, ‘bound-
less and immoderate admiration for
Hitler’ (as one of the defense wit-
nesses called it)” (p. 133)! Is it ex-
asperation to ask: what is fanaticism
if not such a “conscience” and such
“boundless and immoderate admiration
for Hitler”?

We confess that we are not con-
vinced that Eichmann was not a fa-
natic and an anti-Semite. Even what
Dr. Arendt seems to regard as a po-
tent argument that Eichmann himself
failed to ‘use does not persuade us:
Dr. Arendt assures us that Eichmann,
had he “been a bit less prim,” could
have told the Court “that in Vienna
. . . he had a Jewish mistress” despite
the fact that “Rassenchande, sexual
intercourse with Jews, was probably
the greatest crime a member of the SS
could commit” (pages 26, 27). In other
words, like any normal man, there was
nothing Eichmann would not risk for
“an ‘old flame’ from Linz” even if
she was Jewish. . . .

J m.Y-Aucusr, 1963

TO HER Eichmann psychograph, Dr.
Arendt adds another “normal”
quality. Like most normal people, he
liked to enjoy his work (although I’ve
heard that many people don’t). In
1932, it seemed, Eichmann had got-
ten an unwanted transfer on his job
from Linz to Salzburg, and he told the
police interrogator in Jerusalem, “I
lost all my. joy in my work . . .” Dr.
Arendt promptly comments: “From
such sudden losses of Arbeitsfreude
Eichmann was to suffer throughout
his life. The worst of them occurred
when he was [in Au.g., 1941] told of
the Fuehrer’s order for the ‘physical
extermination of the ]ews,’, in which
he was to play such an important
role. This, too, came unexpectedly; he
himself had ‘never thought of . . .
such a solution through violence,’ and
he described his reaction in the same
words: ‘I now lost everything, all joy
in my work, all initiative, all interest;
I was, so to speak, blown out’ ” (p.
27 and repeated, p. 79).

Now for some 75 pages we were left
with the disconcerting impression that
this normal Everyman Eichmann had
dutifully but joylessly been literally
railroading hundreds of thousands of
Jews to their death-camps until we
learned on p. 101 that at the Wann-
see Conference, Jan. 20, 1942, at
which the entire German apparatus
was mobilized for the Final Solution,
all his doubts about the Final Solu-
tion were resolved when he saw the
whole apparatus approved it: “At
that moment, I sensed a kind of Pon-
tius Pilate feeling, for I felt free of all
guilt.” Now we at least assumed that
at this moment Eichmann normally
also regained his Arbeitsfreude and
not only thereafter enjoyed his work
but (to his “undoing”) even bragged
about it. . .
