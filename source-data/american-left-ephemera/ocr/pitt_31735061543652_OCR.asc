 

 

Fifth, the reactionary Social-Democrats and the majority of
reformist labor officials have moved into open, alliance with
the imperialists.

And, ﬁnally, a new upsurge of resistance is sweeping the
labor-progressive camp and a new progressive political align-
ment is taking place.

These are the main new features which must be taken into
account, if the progressive camp, especially the most advanced
workers, are to map out tactics for the ’48 elections which
will enable the people to check the new dangers of war and
fascism and take fullest advantage of the new opportunities
for developing the people’s counter-offensive.

MONOPOLY RUSHES WAR PREPARATIONS p

The ﬁrst new feature of the present situation—the war at-
mosphere—dominates the whole national scene. As Comrade
Foster has stressed in his report on the international situation,

A reaction’s postwar offensive has reached an advanced stage of

war preparation which proceeds with gathering -speed and
extends its scope to every aspect of the country’s life. '

The ﬁrst postwar Presidential elections take place when
our country is still officially in a state of war, and many war-
time controls remain in effect. The Anglo-American Combined
Chiefs of Staff continue to operate as though V-Day had never
come. I ~

Furthermore, the chief acts of the executive branch of the
government and of Congress are marked by a single-minded
devotion to promoting monopoly proﬁteering and imperialist
expansion, to organizing anti-Soviet war incitement, and to
stepping up all measures of preparation for World War III.

Thus, for example, the special session of Congress last
November-December had as its sole business the sanctioning
and ﬁnancing of “stop-gap” intervention in France and Italy,

and the advancement of U.S. war preparations in Bizonia and

Japan.

-—————-&.——-~

 

 

Thus, the present‘ session of Congress is concentrating on. i

the main immediate legislative program of U.S. imperialism—-
the bipartisan Marshall Plan and the war budget presented
by Truman. Thus, too, the Administration and -the State
Department are constantly organizing a host of provocations
against the Soviet Union and the new democracies, and daily
creating new artiﬁcial war crises.

This war drive and hysteria are designed to serve four main
purposes. First, to advance the preparations for an anti-Soviet
war, for World War III, under the guise of saving democracy
from Communism. Second, and on the road to this end, to
restore Germany and Japan as reactionary centers under U.S.
domination, and at the same time to rob other countries of
their national independence and open the door wide for U.S.
monopoly’s penetration into their economies and political
affairs. Third, to increase monopoly proﬁts and lower the
economic standards of the working people, particularly in
preparation for a reactionary solution of the coming eco-
nomic crisis. Fourth, to intimidate all opposition to Wall
Street's schemes of world domination, liquidate all opposition
elements in the twin war parties, and throttle the new people's
peace p-arty at birth.

_ MARSHALL PLAN ACCELERATES NEW
‘ . ' ECONOMIC CRISIS

A second feature of the new situation is the one-sided and
disjointed development of the national economy, in which
production to meet the accumulated peacetime needs of our
own and of other peoples lags, while war production booms,
and in which there takes place an accelerated maturing of
all elements of -a cyclical economic crisis.

The monopolists are striving to outstrip their gigantic war
proﬁts by unprecedented peacetime proﬁteering and by main-
taining the armament industries at near war levels.

The steel industry, for example, is operating at near capa-

9

   

city. But a steel “shortage” holds back large-scale housing con-
struction and the full production of autos. Further curtailment
of home-building and auto production is in prospect if the
Marshall Plan is carried out.

The steel trust has good reason to block the expansion of
steel production to meet peacetime needs at home and abroad.
It proﬁts handsomely through monopoly price-ﬁxing for do-
mestic consumption. It will proﬁt from the system of govern-
ment allocations to the Marshall Plan satellite states. It is
expecting to extract huge super-proﬁts~from its investments
in the German steel industry which is to be revived under
the Marshall Plan.

Similar unbalances affect all industry. For example, if the
recommendations of the President’s Air Policy Committee
are adopted, the aviation industry will get a big shot in the
arm. But the government is offering no program to stave off
the maturing and anticipated acute “recession” that will soon
take place, especially in the consumers’ durable goods in-
dustries.

Neither Truman nor the G.O.P.-dominated Congress shows
any disposition to interfere with the monopoly practices that
keep prices zooming. But they encourage the drive toward
speed-up, longer hours, and wage freezing.

While one of the purposes of the Marshall-Vandenberg
Plan is to try to delay, or at least to ameliorate, the conse-
quences of the approaching economic crisis for American
monopoly, the actual effects of this Plan on the domestic
economy will be, among other things: increased inﬂation,
further undermining of the people’s living standards, a
greater unbalance between exports and imports, and an ac-
celeration of the uneven development of industrial produc-
tion.

Thus, the internal economic aspects of the bipartisan Euro-
pean Recovery Program will greatly sharpen monopoly com-
petition and the basic contradiction of capitalism, the contra-
diction between social production and private appropriation.

Hence, the Marshall Plan will hasten and make more devastat-
ing the coming economic crisis.

Further, it must be stated, the one-sided economic aspects
of the government's bipartisan foreign policy, as well as the
decline in production in certain basic industries, ‘the rise of
unemployment and part-time employment, the growth of in-
ventories and the recent drop in commodity and stock-market
prices—a1l indicate that the approaching economic crisis is
developing at a fast pace. This, in -turn, stimulates the in-
creased aggressiveness of Wall Street imperialism.

REACTION BREEDING NEW DANGER
OF FASCISM

The Marshall Plan is having another dangerous impact on
the economy and political life of our country. Its extension of
“state” controls over wide areas of trade, credits, and capital

-investments abroad accelerates the ultra-reactionary develop-

ment of state monopoly capitalism. This process—the closest
fusion and organic tie-up of ﬁnance capital with the state,
which -it dominates—picked up speed during World War II.
It is now being further stimulated, not only by the Marshall
Plan, but also by the program of state monopoly control and
production of the atom bomb and atomic energy——a program
designed to advance the monopoly interests of the DuPonts,
General Electric, and Westinghouse.

This development of state monopoly capitalism is an im-
portant factor in the third new feature of the present situation
—the new danger of fascism presented by the postwar offensive
of imperialist reaction. A

The position of American monopoly capital at the end of

.World War II is quite different from its position in the ﬁrst

postwar period. While the outcome of World War II further

seriously weekened the capitalist world as a whole, and

deepened the general crisis of world capitalism, in the United

States it brought the concentration of economic power to a
1 1

 

new high level. This concentrated monopoly power is now
being challenged by the freedom-loving peoples everywhere.
And in the United States it faces a stronger working class and
a stronger and more mature Communist Party than in the
1g2o’s. ' A - V V

Consequently, a new world situation and a changed relation
of forces at home confront the economic royalists with new
problems. The goal which U.S. monopoly has set itself is world
domination. Inevitably, its means for achieving that_ goal are
fascism and war. - , A,  A

In the United States the drive toward fascism does not fol-
low the pattern set by Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in Ger~
many. Here the pro-fascist monopolies are not depending on a
new Man on Horseback to create a new mass party of anti-
capitalist demagogy and.fascism. Instead, they are subverting
the governmental apparatus and are utilizing the men of the
two major parties to turn American bourgeois-democratic in-
stitutions into fascist-like inlstrumentalities. Also, they are try-

ing to transform the existing bourgeois political parties and.

the bourgeois-controlled mass organizations—1ike the American
Legion—into instruments for acquiring a mass base of fascist
propaganda and operation. .
The_American pro-fascists glorify “free private enterprise,”
the two-party system, and the shadow-boxing of bourgeois
“opposition” parties. They use the two-party system and the
Congress to put over the governmental measures needed to
gear the home front to the requirements of the Ang1o-Ameri-
can “anti-Communist” Axis foreign policies. Thus, the pro-
fascist Taft-Hartley Law which was. designed to cripple and
destroy the trade unions was the work of a bipartisan. bloc in
Congress and carries the sanction of the Administration in- its
ever-widening application to. all ﬁelds of labor-capital rela-
tions. »

a “constitutional” cloak for its pro-fascist, anti-Communist
legislation. The “loyalty” -thought control order, and repres-
.. . i .  . . 12 4

 

Similarly, even the bipartisan un-American Committee seeks A

 

 

sive anti-labor‘ legislation introduced in the states and in
Congress, are not brought forward as the police state measures
they are in fact. On the contrary, they are presented as means
for saving the nation from “totalitarianism,” and for defend-
ing democracy against the Communists, who are basely slan-
dered as “ﬁfth columnists” conspiring to set up a police state.

Unprecedented demagogy, which goes hand in hand with
unprecedented repression, aims to blind the people to the
growing fascist danger. Thus, the report of the President’s
Committee on Civil Rights voices a hypocritical concern for
the rights of the Negro people. This is not only a vote-
catching device. It is also sucker-bait designed to win support
foihthie plr:-fascist proposal  leutlaw thedComn(1iunist Party-
a it er- 1 e pro osition w 1c 1S now a vance as a means
of “defending” cizlilliberty and is disguised as “registration.”

It is no accident that among the advocates of anti—democratic
legislation are the forces which incite various forms of vigilante
action. The top leadership of the American Legion, Catholic
War Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Jewish War
Veterans, as well as the Gerald Smiths and the Ku Klux Klan,
show in action where the “anti-totalitarian” slogan of the
State Department, the N.A.M., and the Morris Ernsts really
lands.

The accelerated militarization of the country which accom-
panies the postwar drive of the American monopolists and the
1Il11ilit123"y.to lcllomidate the wotr)11d—lthed goal priginallyT:t by

why the unprecedented extension of banker-military control
over the agencies of the government and the ﬁelds of motion
pictures, radio, education, science, journalism, and industry is
alarming wide sections of the population. . .

These and similar developments make it crystal clear that
the growing offensive of monopoly reaction is increasing the
danger of fascism, as well as war; and that to ﬁght the twin
dan ers of fascism and war, it is more than ever essential to
ﬁghi; the twin parties of imperialist war and reaction.

WALL STREET’S BIPARTISAN VVAR CAMP

This brings us to a fourth feature of the present situation-
monopoly’s new effort to utilize its two-party system for the
de facto establishment of a single bipartisan war party.

The realignment -that began to take place after Roosevelt’s
death has been carried forward. Some nine months ago the
proclamation of the bipartisan Truman—Hoover Doctrine gave
expression to -the uniﬁed political line of the main sections of
American imperialism. Now the Marshall-Vandenberg Plan
has further unfolded the common objectives and strategy of
Wall Street’s most decisive groups—regardless of their formal
political affiliation or partisan differences.

This bipartisan foreign policy is put forward as a program
of national unity which allegedly stands above class and above
party. Anybody who refuses -to follow it is characterized as an
appeaser or a virtual traitor.

Those who hew to the Wall Street line have their tactical
or economic group differences, arising out of partisan machine,
or their particular vested interests—and these differences are
bound to increase during -the election campaign. But it is
obvious that it is not only the Trumans and Marshalls, the
Forrestals and Farleys, who champion the E.R.P. and aggres-
sive military intervention in Greece, Turkey, and China, and
imperialist interference and pressures in Latin America. The
Hoovers and Vandenbergs, the Deweys, Stassens, and Eisen-
howers, helped initiate, and fully abet this predatory im-
perialist program.

VVhi_le. the Tafts and Wherrys may haggle over the ﬁnancial
and_ administrative details of the Marshall Plan, while they
may vote against Universal Military Training, these so-called
isolationists are united with the bipartisan “internationalists”
in support of the government's armaments program and total
preparation for world war. They join their bipartisan brethren
in advancing all anti-Soviet adventures and conspiracies for
imperialist aggrandizement.  “ . ‘

14

 

 

 

Despite Truman’s effort to give the Democratic Party the

old Roosevelt look, it is today indistinguishable from its Re-
publican twin. Minor partisan differences over the details of
how to further monopoly’s basic aims and strategy do not ex-
cite -the American people. The people are now confronted by
two party machines—which constitute a single, bipartisan war
camp. The people have’ no fundamental choice between the
Democrats and the G.O.P.

SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY’S ACCOMMODATION TO
U.S. IMPERIALISTS 4

A ﬁfth feature of the present situation is the reactionary
role of-Social-Democracy and the emergence of a “third force,”
whose assistance enabled imperialist reaction to score many
of its successes in the recent past. A _ .

At the end of the war, the reactionary Social,-Democrats, the
Vatican—controlled Association of Catholic Trade Unionists,
and the social-reformists in the labor movement were already
beginning to accommodate themselves to the postwar program
of monopoly reaction, of aggressive American imperialism.

But in the United States the Social-Democratic lackeys of
the class enemy and many of the A.C.T.U. and reformist trade
union leaders could at first give only limited support to Wall
Street, and their full and open collaboration with Wall Street
was delayed. The Truman Administration’s strikebreaking
role against -the miners and the railway and maritime workers,
and its complicity in the scrapping of price controls, restrained
for a time most of the reformist top officials of the C.I.O., the
A. F. of L., and the Railroad Brotherhoods from openly sup-
porting the bipartisan foreign policy. Rank-and—ﬁle sentiment
against the brazen imperialism of the Truman Doctrine held
back for a while the Murrays and Potofskys, if not the Wolls
and Greens. ,

But the launching of the Marshall Plan marked a turning
point. Now, not only the Socialist Party, -the Social-Democratic-

15

 

controlled Americans for Democratic Action, and the Liberal
Party of Dubinsky, but also the majority of the top leadership
in all the trade union centers are lining. up to support the
bipartisan war program and to preserve the two-party system
of big capital. -

Murray's invitation to Marshall toaddress the C.I.O. con-
vention last fall, and the speech itself, signalized this develop-
ment, and negated the adopted “compromise” foreign policy
resolution for which the Left wing mistakenly voted. The
recent C.I.O. Executive Board meeting brought into the open
the sharp differences on principle between the anti-war
and anti-imperialist leaders in the vC.I.O., on the one hand,
and those who are prostituting themselves to the State Depart-
ment and Wall Street, on the other.

But already, while some misleaders of labor were joining
the Stimson Committee to help the bankers sell the Marshall
Plan, others were helping to put it into operation. This was
the mission that took James Carey to Paris—and now takes
him there for a second time—for purposes of disrupting the
W.F.T.U. This was Clinton Golden's mission in Greece, where
his presence is designed -to place a trade union label on US.
military intervention against Greek democracy. This is Irving
Brow_n’s mission as organizer of a company union of the
Marshall Plan states, and this was the mission of the A. F. of
L.’s ill-fated“ conference in Peru.

These Social-Democratic and labor-imperialist apologists for
Wall Street seize upon the State Department’s demarche in
praise of the Attlees and Bevins, the Blums and Jouhaux. as
“proof” that American imperialism is developing a “liberal”
and “tolerant” attitude toward “democratic socialism.” But
the American workers must realize that those labor ofﬁ-cials
who earn the thanks of the State Department merit only the
scorn of trade unionists; for in every land they are inevitably
the salesmen of imperialist war and traitors to the working
class. .i

The reactionary Social-Democrats and social-reformists in
the labor movement, as well as the A.C.T.U., have an addi-

16

 

 

tional mission in the United States today. It is precisely now,
when masses of disillusioned workers are breaking away from
the twin parties of Big Business, that these gentry strive
to block genuine independent labor political action and to
keep the workers harnessed to the two-party system.

At this decisive moment, when the Wallace-for-President
ticket and the developing. third-party movement stimulate the
masses of workers to participate in and lead a new anti-
monopoly political alignment, the Social-Democrats, the

A.C.T.U., and the Right-wing leaders in the C.I.O. endeavor -

to alter the originally progressive character of the C.I.O. Politi-
cal Aotion Committee. They try to convert P.A.C., which gen-
erally played a progressive role in the 1944 and 1946 elections,
into a vehicle for diverting the workers from the path of inde-
pendent political action in 1948, from the third-party move-
ment and the Wallace campaign. In a totally different political
situation, they seek to use the traditions and past record» of
C.I.O.-P.A.C. as a‘ means of befuddling the C.I.O. membership
and of tying the C.I.O. to the two parties of Wall Street.

At the same time, the new political action arm of the A. F.
of L.—like that of the Railroad Brotherhoods——is being organ-
ized by the Wolls, Dubinskys, and Greens so as to turn labor’s
resentment against the Taft-Hartley Law and the high cost of
living to good account for the monopolists. It is being formed
to bolster the two-party system and to head off the third party,
the new people's party now developing.

Under these circumstances, it is clear that the wage policy
of most of labor’s top ofﬁcialdom will also be one to weaken
and undermine labor’s next big round of wage struggles. It
is hard to say even now which “elder statesman”-Bernard
Baruch or William Green—is doing the most -to promote
longer hours of work and wage freezing.

The bargaining position of the steel workers in the coming
wage negotiations will be gravely weakened if the over-eager
announcement of the leadership of the United Steelworkers
of America that there will be no strike in the steel industry
this year remains settled policy, as it probably will. This will-

17

. WK.

 

ingness of the leaders of the steel workers’ union to take what-
ever crumbs are offered in exchange for abandoning any seri-
ous effort to secure substantial wage increases, and to wage a
determined struggle against speed-up, seriously jeopardizes the
interests of the steel workers and of all labor.

Similarly, while the auto workers have forced Walter
Reuther to talk about wage increases, he is weakening their
bargaining position by talking and working with more en-
thusiasm to achieve increased labor productivity and company-
inspired pension plans.

Thus, it is clear that the struggle for higher wages, as well as
the ﬁght to defend peace and advance the interests of the
workers in the 1948 elections, will require an intensiﬁed
struggle against the reactionary Social-Democratsfthe A.C.T.U.,
and the social-reformist leaders in the labor movement. Slow-
ness to recognize the new need for such struggle, particularly
on the part of some sections of the most advanced workers,
including certain Communists, must be speedily overcome by
the development of a sustained struggle against Social-Demo-
cratism, and by the rapid and effective building of the united
front of struggle from below.

GROWING RESISTANCE TO BIG BUSINESS
OFFENSIVE

The sixth new feature of the present situation within the
U.S.A. is the developing resistance of the American people to
the imperialist offensive of Big Business in both foreign and
domestic affairs. This is a factor of great importance which
sooner or later can force certain changes in government policy,
and inﬂuence the outcome of the 1948 elections and the
struggle for world peace. It is true, of course, that the offensive
of reaction—especia1ly its anti-Soviet and anti-Communist cam-
paign—-has adversely affected a part of the labor and progres-
sive movements, has confused and intimidated certain sec-
tions of the people.

i 18

 

 

Despite this, a new and progressive upsurge is beginning to
take place. The people’s deep apprehension concerning the
roadahead, the bipartisan war policy, and the drive of reac-
tion on the home front, is developing into a mood of resistance.
And a democratic people’s coalition and anti-imperialist united
front is beginning to assemble and counter—attack.

Opposition to Universal Military Training, to the shameful
arms embargo against the Jewish people in Palestine, and to
the encroachments of the military on civilian life brings new
forces into the growing peace movement.

A new mood of struggle against the high cost of living,
grain gambling, and other forms of monopoly proﬁteering
merges with the growing mood of struggle for new wage in-
creases ‘that is extending throughout the labor movement.

In such unions as the United Auto Workers, and even in
the Textile X/Vorkers Union—where the national leaders com-
plied with the Taft-Hartley Act—there is a growing rank-and-
ﬁle movement to rescind this action. Opposition to this slave

labor measure will increase, as it is put into full operation in

the course of the coming wage and contract negotiations, as
the workers ﬁnd out for themselves what it means in practice.

Fear of fascism and concern for the Bill of Rights also
reach out to ever widening circles, as is evidenced, for ex-
ample, by the formation of the Shapley Committee of 1000
and the broadening struggle in defense of the Hollywood
victims of the Un-American Committee.

An ever wider united front of struggle in defense of the
rights of Communists is developing. It shows itself in the
rallying of support to Claudia Jones and Alexander Bittel-
man, to the Communist and anti-fascist victims of the Un-
American Committee,* and in the united front meetings
through which the people of New Jersey and Connecticut
answered storm-trooper violence against the Communist Party,

*Since_‘this report was delivered, John Williamson, labor secretary of

the Communist Party, and Ferdinand Smith, secretary-treasurer of they _
N.M.U., have ‘been arrested and, like Gerhart Eisler, conﬁned without‘
bail on Ellis lslan(l.__Ed. ‘

I9

  
  

 
 

and in the coming forward of hundreds of progressives to
demand that Gerson be seated in the New York City Council.
This movement must and will reach a higher stage of devel-
opment as our Party ﬁghts for its very life against the new
fascist attempt to outlaw it under the guise of forcing us to
register as “foreign agents.”

The struggle of the Negro people for an end to their national
oppression enters a new stage, reinforcing all the other strug-

gles for democratic rights with which it is inseparably linked. .

Even the Truman Administra-tion is obliged to take cog-
nizance and maneuver in face of the growing political matur-
ity, unity, and militancy of the Negro people. Both major
parties of Big Business show their fear of what this means by
the frenzy of their demagogic promises as well as by their
mounting offensive against Negro rights, especially in the
South.

THE RISING THIRD-PARTY MOVEMENT

Above all, the people’s resistance and developing counter-
offensive are measured in the rise of the Wallace-for-President
movement and in the growth of independent, progressive
political parties in the various states. This anti-war and anti-
monopoly coalition is deeply rooted among the common peo-
ple. It is broadening and is leadingto a historic breakaway
from the two—party system through which capitalism has long
ruled the American people.

The Wallace-for-President ticket has substantial support,
not only among the third-party forces, but also among non-
partisan independents, Roosevelt Democrats, and Norris-La
Guardia Republicans. Wallace's candidacy guarantees that
there will be full public debate on the issue of foreign policy.
And the developing third-party movement guarantees that the
people will have an instrument for channelizing and giving
effective expression to their opposition to the twin parties of
imperialist war and reaction.

20

 

 

This trend toward a historic breakaway from the two-party
system does not follow "the pattern anticipated by the advanced
workers years ago.‘ It did not arise from a severe economic
crisis, but was born in the course of the people’s crusade for
peace and civil liberty. It is not a labor party, nor even a
farm-labor party. It is a new type of people’s anti-war and
anti-monopoly party arising out of the new anti-imperialist
and democratic people’s coalition which is being created
within the U.S.A. and which reﬂects in its own way the struggle
between the world camps of progress and reaction.

It is worth while to take note of certain differences between
this new par-ty alignment and the LaFollette movement of
1924. The Wallace ticket and third-party movement of today
are more than a ﬂare-up of protest, or a ﬂeeting electoral
move. On the contrary, they are laying the ﬁrm foundations
of a new political regrouping, of a new people’s alignment
that can develop from a third party into the major party, into
the party of government—into an anti-monopoly people’s
government led by labor.

There are other differences. While the LaFollette movement
was endorsed by the top leadership of the A. F. of L. and the
Railroad Brotherhoods, the Wallace Presidential movement is
condemned by the bureaucracy of labor. But this third party,
born in 1948, already has a stronger trade union base and is
more inﬂuenced by the progressive labor movement than was
the third party ticket that was born and died in 1924.

Further, this new united front people’s party comes into
being in a different postwar international situation, when
the working class and the democratic camp as a whole have
vastly improved their positions on a world scale. It comes into
being at a time when the organized trade union movement is
many times larger and more powerful, and when the Left
wing in the United States, including the Communist Party,
is- markedly stronger and more experienced in struggle. And,
ﬁnally, the Wallace movement’ has deep roots among the
Negro people, whom it is sweeping into political action—while
the LaFollette movement stood aloof from the struggles of the

21

 

Negro people and was weakened by the absence of the Negro
masses from its ranks.‘

There is also an important point of difference between the
new progressive party now entering American political life
and -the Labor Party of Great Britain. The third party and
the Wallace movement have not yet the British Labor Par-ty’s
formal ties with the majority of the trade unions. However,
this new political alignment is developing under anti-fascist
and anti-imperialist inﬂuences and not under reactionary
Social-Democratic and Red-baiting inﬂuences.

We have examined, though brieﬂy, the signiﬁcance of this
new progressive movement that will inﬂuence the outcome of
the 1948 elections and that promises to affect decisively the
course of future political developments.

The problem now is—how to realize to the full the new
historic opportunities it opens up.

II. THE OBJECTIVES AND TACTICS OF THE LABOR-
PROGRESSIVE CAMP IN THE 1948 ELECTIONS

‘Confronted by the increased danger of war and fascism, and
takinginto account the developing progressive upsurge and
independent political realignment among the American peo-
ple, the anti-war and anti-monopoly camp has determined
its main objectives in the 1948 elections. '

The major political goals of the camp of progress in these
elections have been stated by Wallace, the Progressive Citizens
of America, the American Labor Party, and the new progres-
sive parties of Illinois and California, as. well as by the Com-
munists and other advanced workers in the labor and‘ Negro
people’s movement.

Among the concrete aims of the people’s‘ anti-imperialist
camp in the Presidential elections are the following:

To organize effective resistance to the warmongers and to

all imperialist adventures. _
To strengthen the crusade for peace, and especially for
American-Soviet friendship and co-operation as decisive for

, achieving United Nations unity, universal disarmament, and

the outlawing of the atom bomb.

To check inﬂation and curb monopoly proﬁteering; to pro-
tect the people from the ravages of the rapidly approaching
economic crisis. To achieve a 25 per cent wage increase for
workers both_ in private industry and government employ-
ment; to adopt a health, educational, and large-scale, low cost
housing program, and a people’s, anti-monopoly tax program;

23

 

 

and to safeguard the economic welfare .of labor, the farmers,
the Negro people, the aged, youth, veterans, women, and small

' businessmen.

To strait-jacket the pro-fascists and all advocates of police-

" state measures; to defend the Bill of Rights; and to safeguard

theyrights and civil liberties of labor, the Negro people, and
the foreign-born, of the Communists and all other progressives.
Together with these vital immediate aims, the labor—pro-
gressive camp has set itself certain other political-organiza-
tional tasks in 1948. These include the adoption of allneces-
sary -steps to oppose and defeat the candidates and parties
of war and imperialist reaction; to achieve the maximum
popular Presidential vote for Henry Wallace; to elect a pow-
erful bloc of progressive, anti-war Congressmen; to build ‘and
extend the third-party movement as part of a broader demo-
cratic, people’s anti-monopoly coalition. -

. ENORMOUS POTENTIALITIES OF THE NEW
PEOPLE'S PARTY

A What are the possibilities for achieving these minimum
goals? These immediate political and organizational objectives
of the progressive camp are not Utopian. They are attainable
in 1948. ,

Already, the emergence of the independent people’s peace
party and the Wallace candidacy have created a new and
positive political factor in the political situation. They have
affected all political regroupings and have begun to inﬂuence
the course of events.

The struggle for peace and progress will now grow and
advanee with greater power and effectiveness. As it does, a
new political perspective unfolds: the perspective of forging
a new progressive political alignment and a new people?s party
that will lay the basis ‘for creating a new political situation
and a people’s anti-monopoly and anti-imperialist government.

29, the ﬁrst returns of the Gallup and t'”RKoper polls indicate
that, as of now, Wallace could obtain at least six to eight

per cent of the national Presidential vote, with possibly 11

per cent in Massachusetts and from 13 to 18 per cent in New

York.

‘These early surveys, seen in the light of the mass anti-war,
anti-Truman, and anti-G.O.P. sentiment, reveal that it is pos-
sible for the new third party at least to rise to the position of ‘
second party in 1948. They indicate further that in a number

of states it is deﬁnitely possible for the new people’s party to
.emerge as the ﬁrst party in November. \ '

These pre-election estimates and the new relationship of
political forces now taking place conﬁrm the judgment that
the Wallace candidacy and the third-party movement will
appreciably raise the total Presidential vote nationally, and
can substcmtially aid the election of scores of progressive Con-
gressmen—many as Democrats, some as independents, ‘and a
few as Republicans. —

Moreover, they can speed the formation of a national anti-
war and anti—monopoly coalition and people’s party, as a
decisive independent political force which can increasingly
inﬂuence all political developments, including governmental
policy. _

The questioninow is, how to realize these objectives.

NEED FOR EXTENSION OF THE THIRD-PARTY
- MOVEMENT

To achieve these immediate goals, it will be necessary in
the first place for the labor-progressive camp to strengthen and

‘extend the organization of the third-party movement and the

Wallace-for-President campaign on a broad united front basis

, and under progressive working-class leadership.

Prior to V/Vallace’s announcement of hiscandidacy, the

A.L.P. already existed in New York, and new progressive
parties were in process of formation in California and vlllinois.
Since the Wallace declaration, new parties or organizing com-
mittees have been or are being established in Michigan, 'Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and other states.

These parties and committees support Wallace and have '
adopted a progressive program. They embrace substantial sec-
tions of the workers in unions under progressive leadership. \
They include a considerable number of workers from the
railway, auto, and rubber workers’ unions, as well as mem-
bers of the Farmers Union. They involve an important sector ,
of the Negro people. They also include large numbers of l
veterans and young people and a sizable percentage of the
independent professional and middle-class forces grouped
around P.C.A.

These organizations and groups and the developing third-
party movement which spearheads the \/Vallace Presidential
campaign, are erecting solid foundations for the future of the ;
new political alignment now taking place. Equally, they can ‘
play a key role in the 1948 elections.

However, these developments are only in the initial stage.
The new parties and the various sponsoring committees for
state third parties or independent tickets, contain primarily
the nucleus for the future. In many cases they are compelled
to organize on a relatively narrow basis and with a minimum
of preparatory work, in order to meet the electoral require-
ments of reactionary state laws for getting on the ballot. The
laudable initiative of the most consistent progressives in help-
ing to form the new part-ies does not, of course, give them 
“squatters’ rights” and a monopoly on leadership or control.

To fulﬁll the immediate tasks of getting on the ballot and
of campaigning for. Wallace and progressive Congressional and
state candidates, and to make possible the realization of the
great promise of this movement, it is essential that the ad-
vanced workers and their allies in the developing new people's
party guarantee the conditions for its most rapid and healthy
growth. V

BROADER LABOR BASE IMPERATIVE

This means, ﬁrst of all, that they must help the new party
(and the Wallace campaign as a whole) to acquire a broader
trade-union base and leadership and ensure that the progres-
sive and class-conscious workers exercise a greater political
inﬂuence in this movement. ‘

To this end, the progressive third—party advocates and lead-
ers should boldly extend their activity so as to crystallize
organizationally the wide popular support which already
exists for Wallace and the new independent party among the
rank and ﬁle and lower officials in the Railway Brotherhoods
and the A. F. of L., as well as in the C.I.O. '

The -mass of the w_orkers in the steel, auto, mining, railway,
clothing, and textile industries, as well as in the unions under
Left-wing leadership, are still for Roosevelt’s progressive poli-
cies; they are for peace, Big Three unity, -the Wagner Act,
and F.E.P.C.; and they are hard hit by inﬂation. They are
basically sympathetic to Wallace and a mass people’s party,
even though they may be temporarily confused and misled
by -the arguments of the opponents. ’

If the initiators and supporters of the third-party movement,
including the Left wing of labor, will energetically take their
case to the workers and common people, if they will aggres-
sively'connect the ﬁght for peace with an active struggle to
champion the demands ‘of the workers for wage increases, to

stop speed-up and to resist and repeal the Taft-Hartley Law,‘

etc., they can win millions of workers for Wallace and the
new peace party.

If this is done, and if the third-party adherents consistently
reject and combat Red-baiting and develop the united front
from below—that is, bring into being a united front of action
on a shop, union, and community basis, of all anti-fascists
and anti-imperialists, Communists and non-Communists—then
it is certain that the new people’s parties now being organized
will be able to rally and recruit during the course of 1948 a

27

THE THIRD PARTY ‘AND THE 1948 ELECTIONS

 

minimum of 100,000 shop stewards and other local‘ officials,
as well as enroll at least 1_,ooo,ooo workers as members of the
new party. V

At the same time, it is to be hoped that the Wallace move-
ment and the third party will root themselves more deeply
among a number of non—labor groups, and popular allies of
the working class. '

TO UNITE ALL ANTI-MONOPOLY,
ANTI-WAR FORCES

Foremost among these are the Negro people, among whom
sentiment and support for Wallace and labor are widespread.
Clearly, the Negro people have nothing to gain either from
the Democratic Party of Truman, Harriman, and the Southern
Bourbons, or from the Republican Party of Hearst, Mc-
Cormick, Hoover, and Taft. They have been betrayed both by

the party founded by Lincoln and by the party which once '

merited the backing of the labor—democratic coalition that
supported Roosevelt.

But the Negro people, whose electoral support cannot be
taken for granted, can be won in their millions only by a_
militant, all-inclusive people's party that ﬁghts, and ﬁghts
consistently, for their needs, and by_a party that boldly invites
them to be its candidates and offers them posts of leadership.
This is an important lesson conﬁrmed by the experience of

‘ the Progressive Party in the recent Chicago judicial campaign.

Secondly, the too often neglected middle and low income
groups among the farm population should receive special at-
tention in 1948. The G.O.P. has aroused their resentment
with its attack on the co-operative movement, an attack tacitly
supported by the Democrats. Both major parties share respons-
ibility for the high prices farmers must pay for manufactured
goods, while neither has come forward with a ﬁghting program
in defense of their most pressing needs.

The great reservoir of anti-Wall Street, anti-monopoly, and

‘ 28

 

 

 

 

anti-war sentiment existing among the farmers can now be ‘

translated into active support for-the M/allace ticket and the
third-party movement through a vigorous election campaign
in the rural areas in which local farmers are brought forward
as candidates, and through a rounded-out program and active
struggle on all issues that affect the farmers’ welfare.

Among the youth and the women, as well as among the

white collar workers and professionals, peace sentiment is.

strong, and herein lies the great appeal of the Wallace move-
ment to these groups. But to transform sympathy into an

‘ avalanche of V/Vallace votes and wider organized support for

the third party, it will be necessary, not only to campaign for
peace and against the Marshall Plan, universal military train-
ing, etc., butalso toraise effectively a number of other issues,
such as rent control and housing; salary increases for the white
collar, professional, and governmental employees; academic
freedom and more adequate subsistence beneﬁts to G.I. stu-
dents, adequate educational facilities, school lunches, and
playgrounds, etc. It will also be necessary to draw the best

representatives of the youth, women, and intellectuals into-

responsible leadership at all levels in the new people’s party,
and to bring them forward as candidates. .

Likewise, the \/Vallace campaign and the third-party move-
ment should deeply concern itself with the needs and prob-
lems of the nationality groups, with the welfare and ‘demands
of the Jewish people, the American-Slav groups, and other
minorities. If the new coalition party steadfastly combats anti-
Semitism and discrimination against the foreign born and na-
tional groups, it will enlist broader reserves in the people's
crusade for peace and security.

UNMASK THE “LESSER EVIL” DEMAGOGY

To ﬁght effectively and to register the greatest political
inﬂuence and gains, it will also be necessary for the third-party
movement, and especially for the advanced workers, to develop

29

 

a systematic and aggressive mass ideological campaign around
a number of key questions. i

For one thing, the labor-progressive camp must unmask the
new campaign of the A.D.A., Carey, and the Democratic high
command, to parade Truman as a New Dealer, a Roosevelt
reincarnated. Here it should be pointed out that actions still
speak louder than words, and that Truman has never lifted
his little ﬁnger to line up the Congressional members of his
own party in support of a single progressive proposal for which
he hasdemagogically spoken up. But, on the contrary, he has
cracked the whip plenty when it came to questions of interven-

. ing against democracy in Greece, Turkey, China, France, and

Italy+—or of strike-breaking on the U.S. home ground.

The propaganda that Truman is the “lesser” of two evils
must also be vigorously exposed and demolished. Between the
partisan candidates of the bipartisan war party—whether it be
a Truman or a Bowles, a Taft or an Eisenhower—there cannot
be a democratic, a people’s alternative. Between the candidates
of Dillon, Read and Co., and the white supremacists of the
South, on the one hand, and the Deweys and Hearsts of the
North, on the other, there cannot be any choice. Between the
open proponents of the Taft—Hartley Law and the Truman
abet-tors and vindictive administrators of this Act there can-
not be any basic dividing line.

In the present political campaign there is a progressive alter-
native to the bipartisan candidates and parties of Wall Street:
a vote _for Wallace cannot be “wasted.” It will be a vote for
peace and progress, for inﬂuencing the present and shaping
the future. Moreover, it should be remembered that “lesser
evils” are but stepping stones to the greater evil, as was the
case with the position of the German Social-Democrats who
supported Bruening and thus paved the way for the coming
to power of the Hitlerites. ’

Nor should those with a vested interest in the two-party
sy'st"e:In _be permitted to get away with the specious argument
thariwhatever is, is right-—that the two-party system is in the

30

i

 

American “tradition,” that you can't beat it, that it’s here to
stay, etc. The two-party-system must be shown for what it is—
an undemocratic and reactionary electoral setup by which the
‘big monopolists rule and maneuver, and through which, up
till now, they have succeeded in keeping the common people
in a political strait-jacket. ‘

The real American tradition is a tradition of struggle and
political realignment to meet changing conditions. Jefferson,
Jackson, Lincoln, and the democratic forces of their times,
led in bringing about progressive realignments and_in build-
parties. Not the two-party system of Big Business, but the
pioneer spirit, the political initiative and organizing ability
of the American people, is what is here to stay.

Another question which the third-party forces must deal
with is the new barrage of buncombe that tries to present
C.I.O.-P.A.C. and the A. F. of L. Political and Educational
League as the true spokesmen for labor and the quintessence
of independent political action. Here, it will be necessary to
spell out in detail the answer that these social-reformist in-
struments for attaching a labor caboose to the campaign
-trains of Wall Street’s bipartisan war party are the precise
opposite of independent political action. ‘

It is true that in a different political setting, in the period of
the Roosevelt-labor-democratic coalition, P.A.C. did play a
constructive role. But now, when Truman and the Democrats
have betrayed Rooseve1t’s program, when it is Wallace who
carries forward the New Deal and anti-Axis policies, and when
the essence of independent political action is based upon, and
organically interwoven with, the emergence of the new peo-
ple’s parties—P.A.C. and the new A. F. of ‘L. Political and Edu-

-cational League serve a different purpose. To the extent that

they support Truman or the G.O.P. they function, primarily,
as brakes on labor’s independent political role. They serve as
-safety valves for monopoly’s two-party system and as a political
_liaison linking the working people to the war party.

31‘

mg new parties when reaction had gained control of the old’

The third-party forces must also expose those who profess
to be for a third party “in principle,” but who are against it

in fact, against the third party that is being born, and against .

the Wallace candidacy. Those who claim to be for an inde-
pendent party, in, say, 1952, insist that the “time is not ripe,"
and that “labor isn't ready.” What they mean is that they are
not for a new anti-imperialist people’s party today or in the
future,.and that they are not ready to go along with the rank
and ﬁle of labor in a militant ﬁght against the monopolies and
warmongers.

The third-party forces must also expose the ideologists of
reaction who would paint VVallace as a demagogue, the dupe
of crack—pots and “Reds,” the “idealist” who “can’t be elected”
and therefore advances a Utopian program and promises all
things to all men. Here it is important to contrast the role
of Wallace, the spokesman for a ﬁghting people’s coalition,
with the servile position of. the G.O.P.-ers and with Truman,
the head of the party of the Southern Bourbons, of Forrestal,
Bullitt, and Farley. It is imperative to show that Wallace sup-
ports a people’s program that can berealized because it is
backed by a people’s massmovement which has already begun,
because it is backed by a people’s struggle that will continue
and grow stronger as the third-party movement and the demo~
cratic coalition consolidates itself and expands.

PROGRAM DEMANDS MOVEMENT OF MASS ACTION

Great mass educational and propagandaactivity is necessary
to build the third party and the Wallace-for-President move-
ment, and this must be unfolded, despite all the obstacles pres-

ented by a monopoly-controlled press and radio. Yet, mass.

action is still the most effective of all means of teaching and
inﬂuencing the millions. Therefore, the new people’s party
will succeed if it develops as a movement of mass action to‘
ﬁght for its program.

32

 

 

Thus, to do the job in 1948 requires more than a crusading‘.
election campaign and parliamentary struggle, important as
this is. It also requires the most active participation of the
third parties, their leaders and supporters, in all the struggles-
of the people, economic and political. Y

These include, for example, the ﬁght against the Marshall
Plan and all other issues currently before Congress. They in-

’ volve the most active participation in the new round of strug-

gles for wage increases. They entail a most resolute struggle
for Negro rights and civil liberties.

In this connection, it is highly important to combine the
general ﬁght for peace, equality, and security, with the launch-
in of determined local stru les around local issues—for ro-

health, _]uV€Illl€, educational, and road program, etc.

BROADER COALITION POLICY REQUIRED

Decisive as is the building of the third party, more than
this is required to realize the main objectives of the labor-
progressive camp in 1948. Equally vital is the application of
a ﬂexible united front policy and the welding of a democratic
coalition in scores of communities, Congressional districts, and
.states. This coalition can and must encompass forces broader
than those now aligned with the third-party movement.

_For one thing, to advance the program and interests of the
new people's party, it is necessary to reach beyond the mil-
lions already associated with or moving toward the third-party
and Wallace movements. It is essential to mobilize other mil-
lions ready to ally themselves with the laborprogressivc camp
in joint struggle around concrete issues, around speciﬁc points
of the Wallace program. ‘

Those millions of working people who are ready to struggle
for their most pressing demands, but who are not yet convinced

33

of the need of genuine independent political action in the
Presidential campaign, constitute invaluable human raw ma-
terial for building a much wider and more powerful demo-
cratic people’-s coalition and united front of action. The estab-
lishment of this coalition, and on a scale far broader than the
third-party alignment, is an important objective of the progres-
sive forces in the 1948 elections. Moreover, this is essential‘ to
ensure the most favorable conditions for the further develop-
ment of the third party itself.

Among the issues on which broad united action can be
realized, and which can enlist even forces still indifferent or
hostile to the Wallace ticket and third party, are many which
we have already enumerated, such as, for wage increases, the
defense of Negro rights and all democratic rights, the Wallace
Peace Plan, the defense of the Jewish people in Palestine, etc.,
and for a rounded out legislative program based on the main
points of the program put forward by P.C.A.

A consistent and many~sided struggle on all levels, parti-
cularly in the factories, local mass organizations, and com-
munities, will advance and forge this ‘gathering democratic
people’s coalition as the base and driving force of a wide and
active peace front, embracing all anti-war and anti-imperialist
elements and uniting in common action people of varying la-
bor, religious and political aﬁiliations. .

II‘ it i

Likewise, to secure the maximum vote and popular backing
for the Wallace -Presidential ticket itself, to make this cam-
paign register with full effectiveness, and seriously to inﬂuence
the course of events, it is both imperative and possible to enlist
the active support of millions of workers and progressives
who are not yet ready to join the A.L.P., the Independent
Progressive Party, or the P.C.A.

In this connection, it should be remembered that the Wal-
lace-for-President campaign and the third-party movement are
not synonymous. Millions will vote for Wallace, but all who
willdo soareinot yet prepared to participate in or join the

 

 

developing third parties. Therefore, the movement to form a
nationwide network of non-partisan independent‘Wallace-for-
President Committees in unions and shops, among the Negro
people, nationality groups, farmers, women, youth, profes-
sionals, and small businessmen, should be encouraged and de-
veloped. This is also the case in respect to the developing
committees of Democrats for Wallace, and of Republicans for
Wallace. In the course of such activities millions will be drawn
into struggle in support of the Wallace ticket and program,
and as a consequence many will be attracted to the third
parties. -

The crystallization of a broad, ﬁghting, democratic people's
coalition is equally necessary, if the labor and progressive
camp is to elect a substantial bloc of progressive Congress-
men. For to elect the largest number of progressives to Con-
gress, everything must be done to achieve joint action on a
Congressional level between the Wallace and third-party forces
and those workers and liberals who may support one or the
other of theltwo old-party Presidential candidates.

It is a fact, of course, that the builders of the third party,
like most of labor, are intent on defeating all proponents of
Taft-Hartleyism. But, unlike P.A.C. and the A. F. of L., they
are not prepared to support every member of Congress who
has nothing to his credit but a vote against the Taft-Hartley
Bill. The builders of the united front peace party are deter-
mined to defeat all warmongers. But here, too, they are unwill-
ing to support every member of Congress who may vote against
U.M.T. or the Marshall Plan. This is so because the progres-
sives refuse to accept the so-called isolationists, the Wherrys
and the_Tafts, as apostles of peace.

Nevertheless, the basis for common action of diverse forces
to elect a progressive Congress does exist. For their part, the
leading spokesmen for the third party have declared that the
Wallace forces will resolutely work to elect a large bloc of
progressive Congressmen and Senators, regardless of party
labels. In many“ instances they will support progressives en-

35

 

dorsed by P.A.C., etc., in either the Democratic or G.O.P.
primary. In some instances they may support a candidate in
a major party primary in opposition to the P.A.-C.-endorsed
nominee, and in the event their candidate loses, they may then
give qualiﬁed support to the winner. In other cases, when the
candidates of the new people's party have a serious chance to
win, or where both Democratic and Republicanrcanditlates
are reactionaries, the third-party forces may be expected to
run independent candidates for Congress and for state and
local ofﬁce. , _

In any event, there will be scores of Congressional contests
in which both the third parties and the local political action
organizations of the C.I.O. and A. F. of L., etc., have a common
position on U.M.T., Palestine, United Nations unity, against
the Taft-Hartley law, for the defense of democratic rights,
for a people's tax program, etc. Here the area of agreement
on issues will be wide enough to achieve common action in
quite a few Congressional elections. Here, too, it will be pos-
sible to bring about the unity of action of the third-party and
the non-third-party forces in many legislative struggles, in the
wage movement, and in the ﬁght for democratic rights and
peace.

CONSOLIDATE LABOR-PROGRESSIVE ‘CAMP

The enemy has closed ranks and consolidated his forces. '

The N.A.M. and the Chamber of Commerce, the militarists

-and the bankers, the high commands of the twin war parties,

and the monopoly press and radio have banded together for
1948. Faced by a common danger, and together challenged by

a glorious opportunity, the people’s forces and organizations ‘

can do no less and pool their strength andco-ordinate their
efforts for the victory of peace and progress in 1948.
-Thus, it is clear that the V/Vallace and‘ third-party move-

ments, and the broad democratic coalition now being’ or-

36

 

.,,;_.__._z.- ._ .._..__,n

 

ganized, have their course charted for them in 1948. The
historic decisions to be, made on the grave issues of war or
peace, fascism or democracy, will be favorable for the camp of

peace and progress only if each and every component part .

of the gathering anti-imperialist coalition is built and
strengthened.

This means that the labor-progressive camp, including its
Left wing, cannot stop at organizing the third-party and Wal-
lace-for-President movements. It must also help build and
strengthen the ﬁghting capacity of the trade unions, the mass
organizations of the Negro people, the progressive organiza-
tions of the farmers, the youth, women, and intellectuals, etc.
Last, but by no means least, this means that the advanced
workers must help build the Communist Party into a bigger,
stronger, and more effective vanguard party of the working
class. ‘ ‘~ - '

V

III. THE ROLE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
IN THE PRESENT SITUATION

The tasks of our Party at this historical moment, as at all
times, are determined by the interests of the American working
class, and especially by the most urgent and vital needs of our
people and country.

It is true, of. course, that we'C\ommunists have some very
special responsibilities as the v-anguard of the American work-
ers, including the heavy obligation to build our Party in 1948
into a. more powerful political party of American Marxists—an
undertaking which we cannot yet expect millions to share with
us. It is true, too, that in the '48 elections our Party will run
a number of Communist candidates for Congressional and
local ofﬁces—candidates who will be supported by only part
of the anti-monopoly coalition. ,

But our objectives in these crucial 1948 elections, and in the
period ahead, are equally the objectives of the anti-imperialist
labor-progressive camp. These objectives are: to check and
defeat Wall Street’s drive toward war and fascism; to organize
the resistance of the working people to the postwar offensive
of the warmongers and reactionaries; and to rally labor and
the people for the counter-attack and the counter-offensive.

This is why we Communists, together with other advanced
workers and anti-fascists, will do everything we can to rein-
force and extend the anti-war and democratic people’s coali-
tion in general, and to advance the third-party movement and
ticket in particular.

_ 38

 

 

At this point, it would be well to deﬁne more exactly our
attitude toward the new progressive political alignment and
coalition party now being crystallized.

THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE THIRD-PARTY
MOVEMENT

It is a matter of public record that ever since its formation
our Party, in accord with the immediate and the fundamental
interests of the American working class, has worked, with the
exception of the period of Browder revisionism, to liberate
the workers and their popular allies from the two-party system
of monopoly capital. Therefore, over the years, we have en-
deavored to promote labor’s independent political action and
the class consciousness of the working class.

We have always understood that the speciﬁc conditions ex-
isting in the United States require not only a strong, vanguard
party of the working class, the Communist Party. These con-
ditions also require a much broader people's party, based on
the trade unions and other mass organizations of the people.
These conditions require a new type of broad people's party
that can embrace millions of workers and progressives of dif-
ferent faiths and social outlooks, who are bound by certain
common interests and have common immediate anti-monopoly
objectives.

At one time the perspective of bringing such a party into
being was expressed by us Communists and other advanced

_ workers in the idea -and slogan of 21 Labor Party, and later in

the concept and slogan of a Farmer—Labor Party. 4
Ever since the rise of fascism, we Communists,‘together with

y other anti-fascists, have especially stressed the need to build a

new type of mass party, a united front peop1e’s party based on
the labor movement, -the working farmers, and the Negro peo-
ple, and uniting all who struggle against fascism and for peace.

During the anti-Axis war years, during the period of the

39

 

Roosevelt-labor-progressive coalition, the organization of such
a party was not on the order of the day. But it was always very
much in order to agitate and __conduct education for a new
mass party of the people, and to keep alive the people’s aspira-
tions and efforts to create the conditions for establishing it.

In the postwar period, taking into account the offensive of
imperialist reaction and the political regroupings in and
outside the Democratic Party, we Communists resolutely
pioneered and used our political inﬂuence to help promote
a new progressive political alignment and to build a broad
democratic, anti-monopoly coalition, led by labor.

In line with this, we have actively supported all anti-war
and progressive movements, including the Wallace crusade
for peace and the efforts of the Left wing in the_labor move-
ment and non-Communist progressives to- organize the new
third party.

The chief criticism that might justly be made of our work
in this connection is that some Communist leaders and state
organizations lagged behind events and were unpardonably
slow in understanding the trend of events, that is, what was
new in the situation, and what had to be done. '

Of course, the Americans for Democratic Action, __t_he Du-
binskys and the Reuthers, and the Democratic cliie‘ftaihs, join
the GOP. and the Hearst-McCormick press in shouting that
the‘Wallace candidacy and _third-party movement are the prod-
ucts of a “Red Plot” and a “Communist”conspiracy.”

But the fact is that this movement, like the democratic

political alignments and new parties led by Jefferson and Lin-
coln in their times, arises at a crucial turning point in the
political life of the coun-try. It develops as a new political
instrument to champion the most urgent needs of the Amer-
ican people. It is born out of the experiences and struggles of
wide masses to meet a new crisis—to grapple with the growing
dangers of imperialist war and fascism, of the coming eco-
nomic crisis, and to ﬁght unitedly for peace and progress.

It is also a fact, as we have noted, that we Communists have
. 40

 

 

our own Party, and we are going to maintain, strengthen and
build it as a Marxist, a vanguard party. At the same time, we,
together with other progressives, support the third-party move-
ment. We do this because we, on our part, are prepared to jo-in
hands with all workers and anti-imperialists who want to curb
the monopolies and prevent the rise of fascism and the drive
toward World War III.

Yet there is nothing strange or “conspiratorial” about this.‘

Precisely because we are Communists we champion the imme-
diate as well as the basic class interests, the ultimate Socialist
aims, of the working.class. Therefore today, as in the past and

in the period ahead, we support all progressive movements and

all genuine labor and people’s organizations, including,_ of
course, the new people’s peace party.

.It is equally a fact that this third-party movement is neither
Communist nor anti-Communist. It is developing as a mass

people’s party, uniting diverse anti-war and an-ti-monopoly‘

elements and groups around a progressive, though non-
Socialist program..Naturally, the monopolists and their_1abe>:~
and Social-Democratic agents insist that the new party is
thus, ipso facto, a “Communist front” and is damned and
doomed because it is not an anti-Communist movement.

Suffice it to say that these frenzied Red-baiting charges prove
nothing except that this new people’s coalition and third-party
movement is a serious independent political force that must
be reckoned with. This coalition already represents a formid-
able challenge to the warm-ongers, to the bankrupt “liberals”
and socia1—reformist labor leaders who kneel and pray before
the altar of the twin parties of Big Business.

And here it would not be amiss to emphasize that there
have been many other mass movements and organizations in
the United States whichwere falsely branded as “Communist-
inspired” and “Communist-dominated”; yet these progressive
movements lost nothing and gained much from Communist
participation and support. Among these we may cite, and with
some pride, the organization of the mass production workers

41

 

and the formation of the C.I.O.; the establishment of the
A.L.P, and of C.I.O.—P.A.C. under the leadership of Sidney
Hillman; and the major role played by all these groups and
forces in the Roosevelt-labor-progressive coalition in 1944.

While we Communists energetically aided and supported
these movements, we did not seek to dominate or capture
them, nor could we have succeeded even if we had so desired.
Neither do we seek today to capture or dominate the new
independent, coalition party of the people.

But we Communists will not allow ourselves to be inti-
midated by reaction and stand aloof from this great historical
movement. To the extent possible, and according to our under-
standing and ability, we shall endeavor to participate fully in
helping promote the new political alignment. We shall con-
tribute our maximum to building the new people’s party,
to furthering its anti-war and anti-monopoly program, and
to the election of progressive candidates who ﬁght for its
program. i

We hope that, in -the course of common struggle against
monopoly reaction and the warmongers, we will help realize
the maximum unity of action between the Communists and
millions of non-Communist progressives in and outside the
third party. As uncompromising ﬁghters for a united front
program of struggle against imperialist reaction, we hope, and
will strive, to be accepted on our merits as full partners in the
democratic people’s coalition and the new political‘ alignment.

And in the coming period, if the third-party movement con-
tinues to develop along anti-imperialist lines, as it can and
should, and if it crystallizes nationally as a united-front and
federated political organization, we Communists will seek to
aﬂiliate with it.

But whether our relations are one of various degrees of
united or co-operative action, or whether subsequently we may
become an affiliate of the new coalition party if it decides to
organize on a federated basis—combining individual member-
ship with group afIiliations—our Communist Party, under all

42 '

 

circumstances, will retain and strengthen its independent po-
litical identity and organization, its vanguard activity and
advocacy of Socialism. . -

In this connection, we can learn much from previous ex-
periences. In our early days and in the recent past, we have
many times demonstrated our ability to go it alone, and to go
against the stream. In spite of more than a few sectarian
mistakes, we have shown the ability to pioneer effectively
among the masses and to set them in motion. We demonstrated
this in the days of the unemployed struggles, of Scottsboro,
and in arousing the people to the prewar dangers of war and
fascism. We demonstrated it in the new postwar period, when
we came forward alerting and mobilizing the people against
the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan.

We have also learned, especially in the last ten years, to
work as effective participants in the broadest mass movements,
which embrace democratic forces far beyond our own—such
as the Roosevelt—labor-progressive coalition.

During this period, however, a basic weakness has frequently
revealed itself. While correctly participating in various peo-
ple’s movements and democratic coalitions, we have not al-
ways, in the past, retained our independent Communist posi-
tion, advancing our programmatic aims, or maintained a
critical position regarding the vacillations and mistakes of
our allies.

In the new situation of 1948, we Communists are determined
at all costs to avoid both sectarian attitudes and any tendency
to submerge ourselves in the broader mass movements. Such
tendencies are liquidationist in effect, if not in form. They
would limit the vanguard role and activity of our Party, and
hence circumscribe the contributions of our Party and the
working class in the democratic coalition. In any case, they
could, unless overcome, prevent us from making our maximum
contribution and exerting to the full either our present or
potential political inﬂuence in the gathering people's coalition
and new political alignment.

THE COMMUNIST PARTY MUST ENHANCE
ITS VANGUARD ROLE

In the year of great decision, all the manifold problems that
confront the labor—progressive camp also confront our Party.
To measure up to our responsibility, and to enable the work-
ing class to exercise "a leading position and inﬂuence in the
anti-imperialist camp, we Communists must greatly strengthen
and enhance the vanguard role of our Party.

To this end, we must focus major attention onsolving the
following decisive questions if our-Party is to perform its func-
tion as the vanguard party of the American workers and people
in the ‘coming period:

1. For one thing, our Party must expand its political and
organizing initiative on all fronts and at all levels. We must
multiply our independent activities nationally and locally,

and-~a.t the same time help set in motion broader sections of the

people who are not yet prepared to struggle directly under

the Party’s leadership. We must help generate mass electoral.

activity as well as other forms of political, economic, and
ideological mass action.

To exercise its vanguard role the Party must not only initiate
independent struggles in its own name, under its own banner
and slogans. We Communists must at the same time help in-
ﬂuence the launching of broad, mass actions through‘the
various mass organizations of the people, whether on the issues
of rent control and housing, for wage increases and against
speed-up, for Negro rights and against anti—Semitism, or for
an anti-monopoly tax program.

In this connection, and most importantly, we must now
help organize the widest support and nation-wide demonstra-
tive activity to lift the arms embargo on Palestine and to

‘ render the most com lete olitical, moral, and economic aid
P P

to the people’s democratic movement in ‘China, Latin America,
and Greece. And, in so far as Greece is concerned, we must do
everything to help prevent that country from becoming a new

44

z
I

 

Spain, a new place d’armes of world reaction, of the Anglo
American imperialist powers.

In cultivating and helping organize the greatest initiative
of the masses, we Communists must avoid reliance upon spon-
taneity. We should avoid all tendencies to tail after the masses,
as well as all tendencies leading to self-isolation.

We must seek out and advance those partial slogans which
will rouse masses of people and advance the p-eople’s struggle,
e.g., the slogan of action for a capital levy on the monopolists
and proﬁteers to reduce the national debt and to finance a
people’s housing, health, and social security program; for a
25 per cent wage increase in both private and government
employment.

Likewise, we should seek out such slogans as will move for-
ward millions of workers and other anti-fascists, slogans that
will imbue the masses with self-conﬁdence and a ﬁghting
perspective. In this connection, it is timely to raise the slogan:
For a people’s government that will advance the cause of
peace, security, and democracy! For an anti-imperialist, anti-
monopoly people’s government!

What is projected in this slogan, it should be made clear, is
a political objective that reﬂects the united front program
which is bringing into a broad coalition all the democratic
and anti-imperialist forces, including the present third—party
movement. Such a people’s government as here projected, in
terms of American realities today, as regards both the objective

‘factors and the forces comprising the people’s coalition and
’ third-party,movement, would not be of the level of develop-—

ment of the new people’s democracies in Europe. For, such
a government on the American scene in the immediate period
ahead would set itself as the main immediate task the drastic
curbing of the monopolies, but its political level would not
yet present it with the task of breaking the rule of the mo-
nopolies and thereby effecting the transition to Socialism.

2. In the second place, our Party will fulﬁll its vanguard
role if it pursues a sound united front policy, if it applies the
tactic of the united front systematically and ﬂexibly.

45

 

At all times, and especially now when the reactionary Social-
Democrats and most top trade union leaders are opposing the
Wallace ticket and supporting Truman and the Marshall
Plan, the united front tactic will be effective and.will advance
the welfare of the workers, if it is developed primarily as a
united front of struggle from below.

As never before, the work of our Party in the communities,
shops, and trade unions, must now be directed toward uniting
in action the largest possible number of individuals, groups,
and organizations. The personal contacts of individual com-
rades, and the contacts of the shop, industrial, and community
clubs——all should be utilized to promote joint action at the
grass-roots level.

While the most progressive and militant workers support
and actively promote the Wallace-for-President campaign and
third-party movement, they must not make the sole test for
united action the issue of support for Wallace and the third
party. On the contrary, the acid test for common action is
provided in each case by "the issue—whether it is for wage in-
creases, or against the Marshall Plan, etc. '

As for us Communists, we shall seek to arrive at limited and
temporary agreements with various leaders of mass organiza-
tions, and to promote common action of the rank and ﬁle on

.all concrete issues which will promote the interests of the

people, including joint action with the trade unions and their
officials who are now opposed or neutral to the new po-
litical alignment. '

And while we will continue to combat and reject all efforts
to deprive the members and afﬁliates of the C.I.O. or A. F. of
L. of their autonomous rights and political liberties, we will
likewise oppose any sectarian tendency to convert the political
_-struggle within the trade unions in behalf of Wall-ace and the
new people’s party into a movement to split or withdraw
from the established trade union centers. ‘

In applying the tactic of the united front from below, we
shall constantly bear in mind that this tactic is designed at all

46

 

times to achieve the unity of action of broad masses against
capitalism, imperialist reaction, and war.

At’ the same time, we shall not ignore the fact that the
Wallace-for-President movement embraces many_ progressive
leaders, including Wallace himself, as well as others associated
with P.C.A. and the National Committee for Wallace, and
that other leaders of national importance will gravitate to it as
it grows and demonstrates its effectiveness in struggle.

A STRONG COMMUNIST PARTY AND PRESS WILL
STRENGTHEN THE COALITION MOVEMENT

3. The next ‘question I should like to touch upon, even if
only brieﬂy, is the basic problem of building our Party, the
need of determinedly working at all times to expand and
strengthen our Party organizations. For without this, without
building a stronger Communist Party, we cannot effectively
exercise our vanguard role, extend our political inﬂuence
and united front relations—and without this, the labor and
people’s mass movement will suffer and become disoriented,
and will limit itself to climbing hills instead of mountains.

I do not want to infringe on Comrade Winston’s report.
Hence, I shall refrain from dealing with the host of new
problems and tasks which we now face, if we are to utilize the
present opportunities to build and strengthen our Party even
now when we are under severe attack.

However‘, I should like to comment brieﬂy on certain‘ con-
cepts of Party building, as well as on some aspects of the vital
problem of attaining a mass circulation of our press.

As we well know, we are working under conditions in
which pro—fascist reaction intensiﬁes its political, ideological,
and physical attacks against our Party. Obviously, this situa-
tion creates numerous diﬂiculties which stand in the way of
expanding the growth of the Party.

This reactionary offensive and anti-Communist atmosphere

presents enough real obstacles to widening the organized base -

47

 

THE   THIRD PARTY

and

and in-ﬂuence of the Party without our having to invent addi-
tional “reasons” and “justiﬁcations” as to why it is diﬂicult,
or “impossible,” to build our Party. .

Apropos of- this, I call upon the members of the National
Committee decisively to reject those capitulatory concepts
and “theories” which claim that under present conditions the
Party cannot grow, that its organized base is doomed to
decline, and that now a loss in membership is even “desirable”
because today we need “quality and not quantity.”

One of the best refutations of the specious assertion that the
Party membership will inevitably diminish as the offensive of
reaction mounts, is the fact that our Party, nationally, will
register at least the same organizational status, if not a slightly
increased membership, at the completion of the current Party
registration. And in such districts as New York,_California,
New Jersey, and Connecticut, as well as in such concentration
areas as Youngstown, Flint, Gary, and McKeesport, our Party
enters the new year numerically and politically stronger than
last year.

This is a decided achievement for our Party, forced as it is
to work under conditions of sharp reaction. Obviously, wher-
ever we work well, concretely applying the political line of
the Party, adapting our methods of work in accordance with
the sharpening struggle, and giving top priority to building
the Party day in and day out, there we can forge ahead.

Now, a few words regarding the “theory” of “quality versus
quantity” now being advanced in certain quarters. Whatever
the intent, this “theory” would in effect circumscribe the
vanguard role of the Party. It would psychologically condition
the Party to retrogress organizationally and to abandon the

"struggle to build our Party under extremely difficult con-
ditions. '

Sulﬁce it to say that the advocates of such viewpoints are
tending to reconcile themselves to a position in which, if their
opinion were to prevail, the qualitative strength and composi-
tion of the Party would radically deteriorate. For under the
slorran of “quality versus quantity” the Party is being asked

48 ’

to accommodate itself to the unnecessary and grievous loss‘
of thousands of industrial workers, especially in the Negro’
working-class communities and in such industries as packing
and auto.

Yes, we do need drastically to improve the quality of our
work, as well as the quality of the composition of our mem-
bership. But to do this, we will have to strive for quality and
quantity. We will have to ﬁght doggedly to improve the
standards of Communist work of all our cadres and members;
we will have to raise the level of Communist consciousness,
loyalty, and_activity everywhere; we will have to light to retain
in our ranks every class-conscious worker and to recruit every
working-class militant who wants to become a Communist;
and in the course of the coming struggles and.on the basis
of educating and training our entire Party in the ‘theory and
practice of Marxism-Leninism, we will attain a higher quality
of Party growth, ideology, unity, and performance.

II i= Ill

Now, a few remarks on the Party press, which is of decisive
importance" for Party building and effective mass work. At a
time like this, when we need more than ever the best that the
Party can provide as agitator, propagandist, and organizer,
we must surely approach in an altogether new way the prob-
lem of building our Party press, and especially the Daily
Worker and the Sunday Worker.

The Worker and the Daily Worker are, in the ﬁrst place,
the foremost instruments t-he Party has for interpreting events,
for clarifying and elaborating the political line of the Party,
and for mobilizing our membership and friends for action.
They are the most reliable medium we have for communicat-
ing with each other, for exchanging experiences, and for check-
ing up on our policies and performance.

But, in addition, ours now is t-he only national, daily English
press consistently supporting the Wallace candidacy and the
third—party movement. In this new situation the Daily Worker
and the Worker become in a new sense indispensable to the

49

 

Party, as well as an important clarifying and mobilizing voice
at the service of the whole anti-imperialist coalition.

We know from experience that we are not going to build
the circulation of our press simply by passing resolutions,
placing this task as one of a dozen others of equal urgency. We
shall develop the kind of press building campaign the times
call for, only if the whole Party takes up this question as a
central task, one which will get major attention from the
Party leadership on every level.

There is one very simple answer to the question of how to
increase the circulation of the Worker and Daily Worker-
that is, to organize and mobilize people, Party members, who,
as a political job of top priority, will go out and sell, dis-
tribute, and utilize our press every single day.

We are all aware that there has been a marked improvement
in the quality of the Worker and Daily Worker. But none of
us is satisﬁed, and we are determined to make much greater
improvements in its political-ideological content and its ﬁght-
ing capacity.

But the biggest problem we are now confronted with is

circulation. And this is not a technical but a political problem.
The Party leadership on every level, must, in a new way, help
the clubs and members to build, circulate, and uti1ize»our
press. . i ._

In the coming period we can expect the sharpest twists and
turns in events at home and abroad. All kinds of speedy and
tactical adjustments will be required to meet the changing
conditions. And the most reliable and prompt means -that we
have of taking counsel with each other and of alerting and
guiding our Party is our press.

Obviously, we cannot turn editorials into inner Party direc-
tives. But the clistrict, section, and club leadership can use
editorials and important political articles as a basis for po-
litical discussion, showing our members in the shops and
communities how to translate policy into practical action.

Utilization of the press also means getting out leaﬂets based on.

its material or reprinting its editorials. It means getting the
50

 

paper and its message on this or that concrete issue into the T
shops and communities, guaranteeing that its most importan-tw -- .
editorials, columns, and «articles reach the active ‘forces and“

cadres, not only in the Party, but in the mass organizations
as well.

Through such utilization and circulation of our press, for
which its editors and the National Board also share a heavy
responsibility, our press will become as indispensable to broad
sections of the people’s coalition as to us. And when that has
happened, the circulation problem will be mastered, and,
as a result, the Party will greatly extend its political inﬂuence
and base. ~ -

, CRITICISM AND SELF-CRITICISM

4. A few words about criticism and self-criticism. As Lenin
taught us, no Party is worth its salt which hesitates to admit,
learn from, and correct its mistakes. -

We know’ that what we went through a couple of years ago
was diﬂicult but essential, and that it paid big political divi-
dends. The struggle for Marxism and against Browderism
brought a new maturity to our Party and enabled us to
strengthen our ranks and extend our inﬂuence in a particu-
larly critical period of our country’s life.

However, one of the big lessons we learned then is that the
weapons of criticism and self-criticism must be kept sharp and
used vigilantly and regularly. Therefore, on this occasion, it
is appropriate to take note of some of our weaknesses and
mistakes.

During the ﬁrst two years of the postwar period, when we

.pursued—and correctly so—the tactic of the Left-Center coali-

tion in the C.I.O., we did not maintain a suﬁiciently critical

position toward our then allies; nor did we combine exist-

ing—though limited——united front relations with the top and

districttrade union oﬂicials, with an energetic organization
51

 

of the united front of struggle in the shops, locals, and com-
munities. A it ‘

Moreover, we were slow in drawing all the necessary prac-
tical conclusions from our correct estimate of,‘-and principled
opposition to, the .Marshall Plan. \A7e were slow to recognize
and speedily counteract the shift and realignment that took
place in top C.I.O. circles in connection with the promulga-
tion of the Marshall Plan. - A

Furthermore, while from the very beginning we mapped
out a sound, ﬁghting policy in respect to both the Truman
Doctrine andthe Marshall Plan, we were slow in rallying the
Left-wing forces in the trade unions and mass organizations
for this program. Nor, in this respect, did we move quickly
and decisively enough to overcome the opportunist vacillations
of certain Communist leaders in the trade unions and the peo-
ple’_s movement.

In connection with the development of the Wallace peace
campaign and the third-party movement, our generally cor-
rect political orientation and line was considerably weakened
for a time by our failure to wage an adequate and sharp enough
struggle against a host of sectarian and opportunist tendencies.
We were muchtoo slow in combating the erroneous views of
certain Party leaders and District organizations, as well as
many of our trade union cadres who up till the announcement

of Wallace's candidacy expressed doubts as to the advisability

of an independent Presidential ticket, and confused the ma-
neuverings and treacherous position of most of labor’s top of-
ﬁcialdom with the position being taken by the rank and ﬁle.

Further, wecannot gloss over the belated and limited res-
ponse of most of the‘ Party, especially of the Communist trade
unionists, to the recent events in France and Italy, in Greece,
Palestine, China, and Latin America. .

Nor can we be unmindful of‘ the fact that even at this late
date we still have to wage an ideological and political battle
to build our Party and our press; to "effect a much-needed im-
provement in our struggle for Negro rights and against white

_ 52

 

 

chauvinism; and to begin to make a real turn in the Party's
mass work among the you-th, among the women, the workers
affiliated to the A. F. of L., and the Jewish people.

The question naturally arises: Why these shortcomings and
errors? Two main reasons stand out, in myopinion:

First, we committed. these errors because we tended in prac-
tice seriously to underestimate the strength and potentialities

of the anti-imperialist camp, the new anti-war spirit and fight- '

ing capacity of the working masses which was and is de-
veloping.

Secondly, over the past two years, we made these mistakes,
and vacillated on a number of questions, because our Party
did not always adequately carry forward the self-criticism and
self-correction developed prior to and during our national
emergency convention so as to examine and improveall phases
of our mass work, especially in developing an effective political
struggle against opportunism which manifested itself in certain
sectors of the people’s mass movement. This became an im-
pediment toward , achieving healthy criticism, necessary

changes in work, and a real Party ideology in the activity of,
many comrades engaged in the broad people’s mass movement.

In critically evaluating our work and in correcting our
mistakes and weaknesses—as we have been and are doing-
no one can obscure "the fact that the general political line of
our Party has been and is correct; and that we have many
positive achievements which have resulted solely because
there is a correct Party line and because, generally speaking,
there has been a correct application of the Party's line and
tactics. K

Despite our shortcomings: it should not be forgotten that
we American Communists did not underestimate the postwar
offensive of U.S. imperialist reaction and the growing war

T danger. Our Party didinot miss the meaning of the Truman

Doctrine, and never, for a single instant, did we fall for the
Marshall Plan.’ -

V/Vhile our efforts and day-to—day leadership have ‘been
inadequate on many fronts, the fact remains that in practically

53

 

  

 

every struggle which has taken place for housing, rent, and
price control, against speed-up, for Negro rights, civil liberties,
and for peace—there, we Communists have participated and
have made a contribution.

The fu-ture may well reveal this recent peripd as one of
historic moment for the American people, and future histo-
rians may take note of our pioneering and modest, though
effective, contributions to big events-not least of all in help-
ing promote the new progressive political alignment now
being forged.

In addition, they may record how thus far we succeeded
in thwarting the combined efforts of the House un-Americans
.and the economic royalists and their twin parties of war and
fascism to outlaw our Party and drive it out of American
political life in this period so crucial for the destiny of the
working class and the nation. Whether in the struggle against
the Rankin or Mundt bills, against the Callahan Act in Michi-
gan or the Caldwell Committee in Washington, or in the
struggle to seat Gerson as Peter V. Cacchione’s successor in
New York City, we fought well and effectively.

The class enemy—monopoly capital—has ‘by no means
abandoned that hope. Even now new efforts are being made
to outlaw our Party. But we have grown. We have consolidated
our positions and our ﬁghting capacity under ﬁre. We will
defend and strengthen our Party, and build it bigger and
stronger in the stormy times ahead. And we will do this all the
better to the extent that we extend and improve our practice
of criticism and self-criticism.

THE STRUGGLE FOR MARXIST-LENINIST THEORY

5. In relation to our new responsibilities, it is clear that our
Party can adequately perform its vanguard role only if it
combines its active and leading participation in all economic
and political mass struggles with a drastic improvement of its
activity on the theoretical and ideological front.

54

 

This is particularly -true today, when the proponents of an
American Century, the initiators of the Anglo-American anti-
Communist Axis, are stepping up their ideological offensive
at home and abroad, in order to confuse and divide the anti-
imperialist peoples and, especially, to indoctrinate -the Amer-
ican people with hostility toward the Soviet Union and the
new democracies of Eastern Europe; when rampant reaction is
striving to imbue the American people with a fascist-like spirit
of race hatred and national chauvinism. And, it must be ad-
mitted, this reactionary ideological offensive has made some
headway, has succeeded in influencing not only certain labor
leaders but also some sections of the working people.

In view of this, we are confronted with a major task—or,
rather, two phases of the same task——in our ideological work:
to expose and combat Wall, Street imperialism on the ideo-
logical field, and to enrich and extend our theoretical and
propaganda work among the Party membership and the labor
and progressive spheres in which we exert inﬂuence.

A few brief remarks on both aspects. In the present situa-
tion the ﬁght against American imperialism on the ideological
front necessarily includes a major struggle to unmask and
combat the hypocritical claims, concepts, and theories that
Wall Street’s drive for world domination is motivated by
“moral” considerations, by interests of “national security” and
“world peace”; that the U.S.A. is intervening in Greece,
Turkey, China, and elsewhere‘ to defend “Christianity” and
“Western civilization” from “Soviet imperialism,” from “total-
itarianism; and that the United States, with its by-passing of
the U.N., with its Marshall Plan, global military-naval bases,
and stockpiling of atomic bombs, is merely expressing “a
world leadership” which was assigned to us from on high be-
cause of America's “allegiance” to democracy and the Four
Freedoms, and because of the “superiority” of “the American
way of life,” of “private enterprise."

Clearly, our Party and all other anti-fascists must initiate
a great ideological counter-offensive against this warmongering

55

  

and pro-fascist'?"‘propaganda, ideas, and'theories. We must ex-
pose this ideology of the un-American men of the trusts in a
basic way, and demonstrate that it is an ideology borrowed
from the'Nafz»i-fascists by those who seek to follow in Hitler's
footsteps. _ "

We must place in the center of this ideological struggle the

‘ exposure of the whole system of national discrimination and

oppression which prevails in the U.S.—the whole system of im-
perialist domination which enslaves the Negro people and
places the foreign-born and "national minority groups in the
category of second-class citizens; the system which promotes
its own “master race” theory, the ideology and practice of
“white supremacy,” Jim-Crowism, and anti-Semitism.

‘Here, as in regard to other basic questions,-‘we must contrast
this state, of affairs with the situation existing in -the U.S.S.R.
and the new peoples’ democracies, with their national-libera-
tion role; we must demonstrate the superiority of the social
system of the great Socialist democracy and the new peoples’
republics.

Finally, to men-tion but one more of a series of additional
{fundamental points, it is essential to make clear that it is not
-«the monopolists but the people's democratic and anti-im-
-perialist camp, headed by the working class, which today

‘genuinely champions democracy and progress.

 

Here we must show how the Wall Street monopolies have
‘betrayed and‘ are violating -the national interests and the demo-
cratic traditions and heritage of the American people. We
must again explain how the economic royalists opposed and
fought every bourgeois-democratic reform and measure pro-
posedby Roosevelt and the New Deal camp, and how they
have scrapped the program for a durable postwar peace sub-
scribed to by Roosevelt at Yalta. '

Equally, we must point out that if the American people are
to advance the progressive and revolutionary aims and tradi-

 

tions of our country, to march forward on the road to demo-.

cratic progress and to attain a stable peace, it is necessary for
56

  

tl1e masses of the people to defend these ideals. It is necessary _

for the people to defend actively the progressive features of
American democratic liberties, to combat the encroachments
of monopoly reaction, to defend the Bill of Rights and the
Constitution, and‘ to extend democracy.

Further, the realization of these democratic traditions and
aims at the present time requires, not only the most active
defense of all democratic liberties and institutions against
their reactionary and fascist enemies, but the further develop-
ment and extension of American democracy. It requires a
people’s struggle for a new type of democracy, for an anti-

monopoly and anti-imperialist people’s democracy that will ‘

staunchly safeguard peace and liberty and open the way to
new democratic advance and social progress.

Now, as to the second main aspect of our ideological tasks,
the general ﬁght for Marxist theory and principles. Here I
would like to limit myself to references to three key questions:

1. We must work to bring about a new Marxist understand-
ing of the role of our Party as the vanguard of the American
working class. This is, of decisive importance to build and
strengthen our Communist Party and thus to enable the work-
ing class to play the leading role in the people’s ﬁghtlagainst
the monopolies, war, and fascism, and ultimately to realize
its Socialist objective. —

To this end, we must combat all tendencies to reduce the
vanguard role of the Party exclusively to the development of
independent activity organized by the Party, in its own name,
separate and apart from all other labor and progressive groups.
Equally, we must put an end to such dangerous liquidationist
conceptions as that we American Marxists can play our van-
guard role as a “small” party, simply as a select party of cadres
occupying “strategic” posts in various mass organizations.

At this juncture, it is timely to recall the viewpoint expressed
by Comrade Stalin some twenty-four years ago:

“The Party must stand at the head of the working
class; it must see farther than the working class; ‘it must

Secretary of the Communist Party. Of Irish extraction, he
has been a Communist for over twenty years and has
served as a member of the Party’s National ‘Committee
since 1936.

Cited in 1947 for contempt by the Thomas-Rankin
Un-American Committee, and convicted by the District
Federal Court, the Communist Party’s General Secretary
is challenging the actions of the Un-Ameri-can Committee
as unconstitutional and outside the scope of its delegated
powers, and is appealing for reversal of the decision of
the District Court.

Until he became General Secretary in 1946 he directed
the political action and mass campaigns of the ‘Commu-
nist Party ‘and was editor of Political Aﬁairs, leading
monthly journal of Marxism-Leninism in the U.S. He is
author of numerous pamphlets, including America at the
Crossroads, What America Faces, Let the People Know,

 “and The People Against the Trusts. ’

 present pamphlet, The Third Party and the 1948
Elections, is the text of his political report to the plenary
meeting of the National Committee of the Communist
Party, held in New York on February 3-5, 1948.

lead the proletariat, and not follow in the tail of the
spontaneous movement. . . .

“Only a party which takes the standpoint of the van-
guard of the proletariat and is able to elevate the masses
to the level of the class interests of the proletariat—only
such a party can divert the working class from the path
of trade unionism and convert it into an independent
political force. . . .

“But the Party cannot be only a vanguard detachment.
It must at the same time be a detachment of the class, part
of the class, bound up with it by all the ﬁbres of its
being. . .  (Foundations of Leninism, pages 109, 110.)

2. Next, as we have already noted, to enable our Party to
fulﬁll its many new obligations, we must intensify and extend
the political-ideological struggle against the harmful policies
of social-reformist labor leaders, the reactionary activities of
the Social-Democrats, the A.C.T.U. leaders, as well as against
the Trotskyite provocateurs. We must mercilessly expose these
servants of imperialism.

We must remind the workers of the treacherous role of So-
cial-Democracy and the reactionary labor leaders in helping
fascism come to power in the prewar period, as well as of their
sinister role today as salesmen of the Marshall Plan and lackeys
of the new Anglo-Saxon A_xis. We must demonstrate how the
Greens and Wolls, the Dubinskys and Reuthers—as well as the
Murrays and Potofskys who help them—are bending heaven
and earth to subordinate labor to monopoly’s bipartisan war
policy and party system.

In so doing, we must explain, theoretically and practically,
the bourgeois-ideological roots of reformism and Social-Demo-
cratism. V/Ve must show how this ideology and these groupings
seek to prevent labor from coming forward as an independent
political force. Without a relentless struggle against social-
imperialism and class collaboration, it will be impossible to
raise -the class consciousness of the working class and to enable
labor to exercise its leading role in the democratic people's
coalition today and in the more decisive struggles to come.

3. A third basic Marxist principle which must now be
fought for with renewed vigor and in a new way is the prin-
ciple and practice of proletarian internationalism. Precisely as
American imperialism fans the ﬂames of anti-Communism, na-
tional chauvinism, and race hatred, as it tries to pit worker
against worker, nation against nation, and stirs up ideological
differences within the anti-imperialist camp, and as its labor
lieutenants seek to wreck the World Federation of Trade
Unions—precisely now we Communists must carry on the most
effective ideological and political struggle to give new life and
substance to the Marxist slogan of action: “Workers of the
World, Unite!” ‘

We must help the American workers and all anti-imperialists
to develop a stronger feeling of prole-tarian solidarity, of in-
ternational co-operation for peace. We must help them to
express this feeling in action in support of the anti—imperialist
and democratic s-truggles of the people of Greece and China,
Puerto Rico, Latin America, and the Philippines, Italy and
France.

For the cultivation of solidarity and unity of action of the
international working class and all -peace-loving peoples, es-
pecially of American-Soviet friendship, is inseparable from
the struggle against war, chauvinism, and fascism. It is of
cardinal importance to curb and defeat our own warmongers
and economic royalists, and to advance the whole struggle for
peace, progress, and security.

it #3 II

To equip our Party leadership and membership to wage
a successful struggle on the ideological front and to make our
full contribution to -the broad people’s movement, we must
enrich the Marxist understanding of our entire Party.

To this end, we must utilize the Centenary of the Commu-
nist Manifesto to stimulate all Communists and class—conscious
workers to deepen their study and mastery of all that a century
of Marxist theory and practice has to offer to our Party, our
working class, our country, and our time.

We must effect a qualitative theoretical improvement of
Political Affairs. We must give more attention to the basic

training of our cadres and to the Marxis-t-Leninist education

of our new and old members. We must develop further, in all
ﬁelds, such projects as the signiﬁcant analytical and creative
theoretical work on Keynesism now being undertaken under
the personal direction of Comrade Foster. And we must sys-
tema-tically promote th-e Socialist consciousness of wider sec-

. tions of the American working class, and generally carry on

the most extensive propaganda and mass educational activity
in behalf of the fundamental class aims of the American work-
ers, i.e., for the Socialist reorganization of society.

If, in this decisive year of 1948, we are to avoid vacillation,
sectarianism, and opportunist mistakes, w/e—-all of us—must
live and breathe the science of Marxism. We must acquire a
new and more profound grasp of the theory and lessons to be

learned from such Marxist classics as the Communist Mani- .

festo, Lenin’s Imperialism, .Stalin’s Foundations of Leninism,
Dimitrov’s Report to -the 7th World Congress, and the History

of the C.P.S.U., as well as from such authoritative Marxist‘

political journals as the new publication of the Communist
Information Bureau, For a Lasting Peace, For a People’:
Democracy.

Comrades! The developing new political alignment, the

gathering democratic people’s coalition and the third—party »

movement, signalize new and bigger struggles to curb mo-
nopoly reaction, safeguard world peace, andpreserve and ex-

tend the people's democratic achievements. These struggles-

must be waged in Congress and out of it, in the election cam-
paign and in the wage and strike movements, in the shops and
trade unions and in the mass organizations and communities.
Until now, imperialist reaction has called the signals and
carried the ball. Now the working people and their allies must
‘ 60

 

 

 

seize the initiative, hold the line, and throw back the mo-
nopolists and all imperialist warmongers. 1948 must be made
the year that decides for a be-tter future, that lays the founda-
tions for a new general political situation in the United States,
that advances the struggle for a people's government which
will promote peace, security, democracy, and social progress.

I. INCREASED DANCERS OF FASCISM AND WAR,
AND THE GROWING PEoPLE’s RESISTANCE

The American people have entered a year of big struggle
and grea-t decision. Struggle is developing on many fronts and
assuming a wide variety of forms. But within our country all
roads of struggle now lead, directly or indirectly, to the 1948
elections. For these crucial elections shape up as a major
battle in the struggle between the camps of war and peace,

_ of imperialist reaction and democratic advance.

What is the State of the Union in which the 1948 elections
take place? We may note six of its new and main features,
before considering each in more detail.

Overshadowing all else is the fact that this peacetime elec-
tion takes place in the midst of an unprecedented reactionary
offensive, in an atmosphere of war hysteria and advanced
preparation for World War III. ‘

Next, the electoral struggle is accompanied by sharpening;
economic conﬂict as the evil of inﬂation spreads unchecked
simultaneously wi-th the approach of the ﬁrst postwar eco-
nomic crisis. ‘

Third, this postwar offensive of monopoly reaction creates
new dangers of fascism.

Fourth, the two-party system, through which Big Business
has long maintained its rule, stands revealed as never before
as two parties. in form, but as the twin parties of monopoly
in essence, having common imperialist objectives, and to all
effects and purposes functioning as a single, bipartisan war
party. -
