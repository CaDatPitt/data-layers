’ By Graham Dolan - _
BUTTE, Mont.—-—An agreement that may end the historic seven-
week strike against the giant Anaconda Copper Mining Co. was reached
hero Saturday, October. 9, between the company and the Mine-Mill
Montana Joint Negotiating Committee. ‘ 5 ‘ ’

The Committee represents 10,000 workers in Butte Miners’ Union
No, 1, Butte Stationary Engineers No_. 83, Anaconda M111  Smelter-
men’s Union No. 117 and Great Falls Mill & Smeltermen’s Union No. 16.

The agreement will be submitted for ratification by the four strik-
ing locals this week. Upon rat1ficat1on,'the strike w1ll‘e1_1d and the last
major operation in the non-ferrous metals industry will have bowed

this year to the power of Mine-Mi1l’s determined membership.

THE MONTANA AGREEMENT~represents an outstanding victory

over a corporation that served notice on the workers and their union
that it would never give into them and that the strike would end only
if the workers accepted“ the old contract, abated document that resulted
from 10years of sell-out leadership by anti-Mine-Mill company unionists

For the first time in many years, the entire Montana I1_eg0tiaﬁ,“8‘
committee was united——united in a crusade to replace the old ineffective
contract with conditions that reflected the desires’ of the ‘workers.

The agreement to end thestrike is not the usual settlement that
one expects, for the issuesin the strike were different from those in
other negotiations in the industry this year.

The Kennecott, Phelps-Dodge, AS&R, Bunker Hill, Miami, Ameri-
can Brass and other majmrllocals had standard trade union contracts.

The main fight of the Montana workers was to win conditions equal to A

those in the rest of the industry. '

In sh01=t,‘tlie seven-week strike here was more than a “pork chop”
fight. It was in reality a~struggle to establish the union’s right to
bargain collectively on several major issues. «

THE NEW agreement makes collective bargaining history in .

Montana. It registers distinct victories for the strikers on such_ issues
as removing strings from holidays and vacations, a decent grievance
procedure and the controversial safety issue in the Butte mines.

ANSONIA, Conn. —— Unity
among workers in the, Anaconda
chain—regardles of union affil-
iation—was demonstrated dra-
matically during the recent
strike of American Brass Com-
pany Workers.

A $500 contribution came to
the striking Connecticut workers
from the AFL Federal Labor
Union, Local 19322, in Kenosha,
Wisconsin. The AFL members
work for‘ the Armrican Brass
Company plant in Kenosha. They
belong to the Anaconda Confer-
ence, which embraces almost
every union that bargains with
Anaconda. it

,-

Even the knotty contract mining
issue, while not resolved completely, was
handled by the agreement in a way that
unties the hands of the contractminers‘

-for the first time and establishes the

union’s right to fight contract mining
grievances in the same way that all

other grievances are fought. This is a‘

major step forward and breaks down
the historic ACM position that the union
has nothing to say about contract min-
ing.

The briefest description of the AClV[
settlement in Montana is that it em-
bodies the same money total as the

American Brass settlement, plus the

major victories achieved in basic non-

economic issues which constituted some

of the most important stakes in the

strike, including the virtual rewriting

of the contrac . '

ANSONIA, Conn.——Mine-Mill’s three big brass locals in the east
have settled with Anaconda’s‘subsidiary, American Brass Company, for
a package estimated worth atleast 10 cents an hour._The agreement

came after a strike of some six weeks which was so solid the com- ,

pany didn't even try to turn a wheel.

The gains won by workers here and at Torrington, Conn., and
Buffalo, N. Y. include: a general wage increase of 4 cents. an hour,
increased pension benefits worth at least 41/2“ to 5 cents an hour, and
improved health anidpwelfare benefits Worth about a cent and a half.

.. . A Pensions \

The pension gains make the ABC setup the outstanding pension
plan in the non-ferrous metals industry. From now on, ABC workers
will be entitled to pension benefits of $1.75" a month,“ in ‘addition to
counting Social Security, for every year of service up to 30 years.

For example, a worker with 25 years’ service will get $152.25 a
month, including his Social Security benefit. ’

Disability  
At the same time, disability benefits were boosted from the pres-

ent $50 to $70 monthly. Retired employees will also receive paid-up
life insurance of $1,000. ‘ V 2

V Hospitalization ,
- Hospitalization for workers in the two Connecticut properties is
increased to $13 daily———which Buffalo ABC workers already had under

A the old agreement. Workers at all three plants will be entitled to 70

days hospital care for each confinement instead of for ‘each illness.
And sickness and disability benefits are increased from the old $30
weekly to $35 if the employee averages more than 34 hours a week.

’ Medical

Sickness and disability benefits were increased for Buffalo from L

the old 13-week limit to a top of 26 weeks. And the surgical schedule

for Buffalo ABC workers was also revised upwrad toa $250 maximum.

The strike was vigorously supported by other locals in District 6.
Contributions included the following: Local 701, New York———$250;
Local 625, Baltimore—$100; Local 813, Buffalo——$50; Local 365, Perth
Amboy——$600; Local 620,/~Thomaston-—-$275; Local 521, Carteret——$70 ;
Local 729, Nassau; and Local 837, Carteret-—$500. '

Contributions to aid the Anaconda strikers came in from a Wide
variety of places. The Int’l. Strike Fund contributed a total of $15,000.
Bayard Amalgamated District Union,. Local 890, in Bayard, N. M.,
sent a check for $3,000 earmarked for Anaconda strike aid with a wire
pledging 20 per cent of its monthly strike fund income “for the duration.”

M ine-Mill is having another banner year in bargaining. ~

ram  4Sj€Cl”etC£I'# ’

 

By M. E. Travis

Despite Chamber of Commerce and NAM propa-

ganda, 'Mine—Mill ‘has crashed through to some outstand-"

' ing wage and contract gains.

Starting with Kennecott

and going through AS&R,' Phelps—Dodge, Coeur d’Alene

_ and "In_t,ernational Nickel, we have improved our Health

’ and Welfare provisions, our shift differentials and have
gotten substantial across-the-boardincreases.

In the Anaconda Copper Mining Coinpany_____and its

subsidiary American Brass, the compsiny after a seven-

week strike, has finally gotten off the dime.

Contract

settlements with this company will be equal to or better
than the settlements among the rest of the Big li/‘_our

in our industry.

How were we able to do this in a year when ‘most
people including a large section of the labor movement

I said it couldn’t be done?

 ur Union, its officers and members, decided, based on A

/

,/

. the operations and financial statements of the compan-
ies, that bargaining improvements were warranted... No
amount of attack by government agencies, slander against
our Union, or personal abuse of our officers and mem-
bers could deter us from this course.

Kennecott thought they could mak'e' a cheap settle-
- ~-ment; a two-week‘ strike proved differently. ’ Anaconda,

still Tooking back to the days of the Masons and McLeans, I

, underestimated the new spirit of" unity and organization
that now prevails in Montana.
And so when all the results are in, Mine-Mill will
again be among the leaders, if notactually at the top,
. of Unions. which this year made‘ a contribution to the
stabilization of our economy by taking a little more out
, of the pocket of the boss and putting it where it’s bad]

_needed——in the

pockets..- of the workers. y: A

But of course, there are two sides to this coin. ,

Employers," reactionary anti-labor politicians,
corporations, newspapers and _government agencies have
intensified their attack upon us.

big

to harass, smash or company—unionize Mine-Mill and

unions like ours.

4--

The Chamber of Commerce called the tune and an
hysterical congress, unsure of the‘ real temper of the
American people, passed the anti-labor Brownell bills.
If carried out to their ultimate‘ purpose, the Brownell

.. " bills would “license”j,free. tradeunions bya systempof
censorship of their ideas, actions, and policies.‘

Of course, the Brownell law applies to much more ‘ 
than trade unions- It applies to every-facet of free-
speech and independent thinking in America. The fight’

against this law will be a fight-in which the entire Am"er'n-
can people will join. Because, it is against the American

people that these bill are directed. V

/ ".

Inthe meantime there is a side—show going on. In the
- past year and a half, the composition of the National
"Labor Relations Board has changed. It is now composed,
in the majority, of individuals who either come directly
from service tolarge corporations or who have been
grounded in the thinking of “don’t push the boss too

hard.” It is no longer the labor board we knew that de— ‘
fended the interests of workers.

the boss.

This board ordered a hear

of my affidavits.

It is a board to protect

ing to questionethevalidity

, The United States Supreme Courthas alr'eady ruled
against the board on a similar issue’ in another union.

Also the lower courts have ruled‘that the board has no

juris iction to take action in this field.

The board must know this.

It is an attempt by an

anti-labor board to harass us and weaken. us in _our
economic struggle. Despite doped newspaper‘stories_, our
bargaining rights are not in jeopardy. The NLRB will
not have the last word to say in this matter.

- i — I repeat what I have often said publicly: If ever the

time should come when our power to bargain is jeopar-

dized from whatever source, then the membership of‘

this Union will have to assess the situation and make
its decision accordingly. N 0 individual can or will stand
in the way of the operation of this great labor Union.

Now that our bargaining struggle is coming to a close,
we are turning our energies to the defense of our Union
and, I might add to the defense of the American people

on the Civil Liberties, front.

\ On October 15, the International Executive Board is
being called into session.” Shortly thereafter, a series
of regional conferences will be held with our local union
officers and membership. As in’ the past, the voice of

A the rank and file of this Union will be" heard.  But only
the rank-and-file—-and no other source-—will determine

,; .,our policies. . '

Chicago Foundry

At Chicago Foundry, about 100
.workers shut the plant down-
'completely_' for 12 ,_days in a strike

tract offer. The company tried to
operate by hiring outside scabs.

The solidarity of the member-*
ship, however, compelled the
company to make a settlement.
The new agreement provides a

three cents more for reclassifica-
tion of wages in the lower rates
affecting about 18 men. _
It also eliminated a cut in the
night shift bonu-s propvosed by
the company, and strengthened
the. union’s rights under the iaru
bitra-tion clause. _ .
Several/days after‘ they went
back to work, the members were
faced with another test when the
company sent home a ,n:usmiber
of Inolders out of seniority.
Through grievance action» of the
committee ‘headed by Oscar

to agree to give two days" pay
‘to the ‘men involved.’ As la 'result
of these’ struggles, union methi-

bership ‘at Chicago—;Fo'_undry is A

-at‘ its highest level in years.

V3’ At‘ bloomfield-. Industries, man-
agement ‘was counting on weak-
ness, and =divisio_n»,among- the 100
some workers. The dispute was

against an unsatisfactory .co_n-,

5 cent general wage increase and.

Gaither, the company was forced-

wins two strikes

over how piece work provisions
were’ to. be applied, and ‘the
workers went out in a solid strike
for two d«ays.'This was the best
display of unity at Bloomfield
in severalvyVears.. Later, the con-
tract WaJS_ settled and ratified,
and —— as in Chicago Foundry -
the membership percentage has
reached a new peak.

Bloomfield workers are keep-
ing on their toes to guarantee a
proper application of . changes in
piece work provisions.
