Chemical Workers union by the

. overwhelming margin of 5 to 1

fi yelast Friday, in an NLRB repre-

' sentation election which brought

to 13 the number of MMSW elec-

The tally showed 1,040 workers vot-
ing for Mine’-'M’ill, as against only 211
for the AFL “Comical Workers”—as
they are known hereabouts. Tlfere were
.7 neither votes, 24 void and 2 chal-
lenged.‘ Some 1,284 of - the 1,437 eli-
gible workers took part in the election.

The AFL union failed even to carry

By Graham Dolan .
TORRINGTON, Conn. — Tor-
rington Brass Workers Local 423
kept the Mine-Mill victory chain
intact last Week with a 472 to
424 triumph over the raiding
CIO Auto Workers. It was the
second Mine-Mill Victory in the
American Brass. (Anaconda)
chain in two weeks.c ‘
Unable to successfully employ
red-baiting by themselves, the

more than a dozen UAW organ-
izers had to resort to religious divi-
sion in the last three days of a cam-
paign which will be known for years
to come as “the dirtiest campaign
Connecticut ever had.” Veterans of the
anti-secession battles against the John
Driscoll gang (now with UAW) all
agreed that the raiders ‘, had never
reached such depths of -falsehood and
foul tactics as did the UAW-CIO last
week.

Mine-Mill took a commanding lead
early in the campaign. The‘CIO pay-
rollers were kept busy trying ‘to de-
fend themselves from Mine-Mill's ex-
posure of the UAW as “the speed—up
union, the union loved by the bosses,
the union that had sold out the Ameri-
can Brass workers.”. UAW’s defeat
by Mine-Mill at the Buffalo ABC
plant had a telling effect and Local
423 was headed for a landslide _victory.

IT WAS WHEN the Mine-Mill cam-
paigners revealed to the ABC work-
ers that UAW had accepted ’a nine-
cents—an-hour cut in tak\e-home pay for
ABC workers at New oronto, Onﬂ,
that the CIO abandone allhonesty
and caution and set out upon a de-
liberate attempt to provoke an anti-

‘no union’ to CIO Steel

PHOENIX, A1'iz,—Workers at the
International Metals ‘Co. ,here have’
voted for “no union” rather than ac-
ceptthe CIO Steelworkers’ Union as
their bargaining agent. .

Although’ Steel was the only union

" on the ballot, it was unable to obtain

’ a majoritypdf the 98 employees in the.
plant. The’ outcoineof the vote was‘

\

     
  
 

  

considered especially significant, since
Steel has another -plant in Phoenix un-
der contract, so that workers at Inter-
national Metals had been able to watch

Mutual agreement
program and policies was reached by
representatives of all of the unions
prior to entering the first joint bar-

gaining session. The joint negotiating‘

effort was inspired by similar previous
bargaining last year resulting in not-
able gains for all Utah Kennecott
workers, and climaxed by victory on
travel-time pay for the Bingham Can-
yon open pit mine workers.
According to the undertsanding
reached between Mine_-Mi11’s Arthur-

conclude any agreement with manage-

and approval of all other unions in the

joint committee. . ’

ALL OF THE BASIC wage and
contract demands listed in the MMSW
1951 Bargaining Program are incor-
porated into the joint all—union nego-
tiating demands, and mutual nego-
tiation !on local issues will also be
pushed wherever the common interests
of the various unions are involved.

 MOBILIZATION of our Union for the fight to win higher
" wages and other contractgains this, year has been delayed
somewhat, mainly because of the raiders—the Steelworkers,
;Auto ._Workers and some AFL Unions. Most of the energy of
_ _. the rank-and-file of the union has been directed towards toss‘-
 Uing out the raiders so ‘that we could move forward on our
 ‘xbargaining program. if . -

 , g It is mostunfortnuate that some so-called labor leaderssee
 _fit ‘to devote their entire time and resources in" attempts to
 V destroy other labor unions, rather than uniting the labor
. movement for action in the face of the highest living costs and
 takes ‘in American history. ' » -

i  every front, and the Union must now be mobilized for action.

 r The wage freeze order has aptly been called a road block

 in the path of the .,wage earners of this country. To remove this

. _ road block isgoing to require the highest degree of mobilization

Collective bargaining in the mining industry is never easy,
but this year with the wage freeze‘ order it is going to be
_ tougher than ever. Big business. is in the saddle and they are

' ‘not going to be moved unless forced to by an aroused rank-and-
file in the‘ labor movement. , f A

Most of labor has been led: back into the wage. freeze by

 labor leaders -who like to raid democratic unions like Mine-Mill
 more; than they like to put up a fight for the welfare of their
 if members. Not a single "concession was gained by these mis-
ﬁg leaders for the rank-and-file of American labor when they
 A crawled back into the wage freeze.- ' 
‘ MIN E-MILL’S National Wage Policy Committee drew up

leaflets screamed “lies, lies, lies,” at
Mine-Mill’s expose of UAW.

On the Sunday preceding the elec-
tion, an outfit called the “Diocesan La-
bor Institute” sent a letter to all Cath-
olic churches’ in Torrington asking that

~it be read at all Masses. The letter
was read by all pastors, urging the
brass workers to “vote against Com-
munism by voting against the Mine,
Mill and Smelter Workers.” 7

Members of the Knights of Colum-

bus were used to canvass ABC work-
‘ ers. Many workers’ wives reported
they had been contacted by their par-
ish priests. Every effort was made
by UAW.to create an atmosphere of
hysteria among a body of workers that

Two pickets have been struck«by'
hit-and-run scabs. Lorenzo Torres was
struck by a car traveling at 50 to, 60,
miles an hour, and escaped death by
a miracle. On June 15, Mrs. Henrietta
Williams was struck by a scab’s car
which drove so close that it side-
swiped her. Mrs. Williams was bruised,.
buttock her turn on the picket line.
This is typical of the magnificent
spirit of the strikers and the entire
local.

The strike was called because of
the company's refusal to grant con-
tract features ‘enjoyed by all other
workers in the area—paid holidays, va-
cations and other such standard con-
tract clauses.

of workers believed in Mine-Mill, its

Mine-‘Mill's campaign was based
mainly on two themes: 1) we had the
bargaining power against the Ana-

corruption and company-union leader-
ship. UAW’s sorry record at ABC in
New Toronto and Detroit were con-

The charges were brought by Strong
and Mine-Mill Int’l rep. ’Rud'y'Hansen
immediately after Strong was dis-
charged from".the -Blackbird ‘mine while
an organizing drive was in progress.

NLRB Trial Examiner James Hem-

handed down last week, ordered the‘

company to give'St_rong full«'reins_tate-
ment\and to "reimburse him'for_the loss
of pay since his unfair discharge. _

The Examiner also ordered the com- 

, pany to_ stopuinterfering with its em-

' The ruling is considered a complete_

victory for the Mine-Mill and is ex-

recall the record of anti-unionism this‘ .
company generated in Alaska some
years ago. True to form, the manage-

7 Mine-Mmasksinvestiganan   

of Ontario Living Cost Index

KIRKLAND LAKE, Ont.—-A demand
that the Canadian Government open ya

full-scale public inquiry "into. the Do- 
minion Bureau of Statistics’ “cost of rd

living index” has been made by Bar-

ney McGuire, president of Mine—Mill

Local 240.

The‘ demand was contained in a let-
ter to Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent,
and was in line with the current cam-

paign of our International Union for
revision of the government “cost-of- "

living" figures both in the United
‘States and Canada.
s McGuire’s letter was sent shortly af-
ter the Dominion Bureau admitted that
the cost of living index was not “an
accurate barometer of living costs”-and
that “it is a doubtful guide to what is
happening to food, clothing and hous-
ing costs in Canada.”

THE LETTER pointed out that for

many years the Canadian labor move-

ment and other public organizations
had been strongly critical of the index
as a measure of the effectof. prices on

-.-living standards. McGuire recalled that

in 1943, -during a special inquiry con-
ducted by the National‘ ‘War Labor
Board, Mine-Mill along with other la-

. bor organizations presented conclusive

criticism of the index, but that the
index has not been improved since.

’ The importance of an accurate index
was stressed because of the increasing
number of union contracts. which are
tied ‘to the cost of living and because
all collective bargaining is either di-
rectly. or indirectly ‘affected by the
DBS index. '

McGuire urged that before a new
index is issued, a._pub1ic inquiry be held

ing gets underway, there's very little

in DiSalle’s’ “regulations” to hold

_prices near present levels.

Suppose the = Democrats don’t go
along with plain extension?

The answer to that is, "What Demo-
crats?” Most of the top administra-
tion. leaders have openly“ expressed
their dislike of price control. The forces
in Congress are so disposed that Re-
publicans and Dixiecrats could override
the handful of sincere representatives
,of- the ordinary people on any issue.
Then 'you’d have no controls at. all.

_What can be done, about it? You»

can-, make so much noise in the ears
of your own congressmen that they
will be forced to act.

Such a drive must be led by con-"“‘

sumers and consumer organizations.

research and public assistance pro-
grams, threatened the nation June 13
as a bipartisan coalition in the Senate
went wild. with their paring knives.

Under leadership of Senators Homer
Ferguson (R, Mich.) and [Paul Douglas
(D, Ill.), the upper house slashed 2,-
500 jobs from, the Labor Department
and Federal.Security Agency -payroll.

A greater danger to organized la-
bor and to; those dependent on public
health services appeared in a drive
headed by Douglas to make even deep-
er cuts in the Labor Dept. FSAA ap-
propriation than those providedin the
Ferguson amendment.

The"I)‘ouglas-led attack’ on the BLS‘

appearedto doom any hope organized‘
labor might have nursed asla result of
the hearings before a House labor
subcommittee in which unions unan-
imously branded the BLS index inad-
equate "and sought broader, more
thorough coverage of actual-changes in

Quit meddling!
 V. To the Editor: ' A" -
Q5  It is indeed a great opportunity to
- belong to a Union that allows a mem-
ber to express hirfeelings on the pres-
ent world affairs and the present peace,
movement. " _

It is my honest opinion that there is
no need for war, for I niaintain that
if it ‘were not for the great profits
that are made through war itself and
the rebuilding of the great ruins that it

' ’ leaves behind, there would be no wars.\
-'1'  Another thing ‘is our government
— leaders appear greatly concerned over
our welfare and say they wish to pro-
tect us from,all these horrible things
that are going to happen to us if we
don’t prepare to fight some other
workers that are, as we are told, ever
so much worse off than we are. If
they are so badly off, must we spend

‘billions of dollars to kill these
peoples? , r _
- If they have such a poor economy

then l_don’t th_ink they could be any
danger to us, especially when they are

15- thousands of miles away, across big
..-.oc_e_ans. If our way’ of living is so much
superiorllet us show these people by
peaceful competition ‘that our way’s

‘ the best. We will never change any-
one’s ideas with jellied gasoline bombs.

I say, if our government -leaders
would spend the same amount of money
to help make this great and free coun-
try of ours a better and finer place to
live in there would Ibo no need for all
the hardships we must endure through
high rates of taxes and high cost of
living. High cost of living that comes,
not through high wages, as the money
monopolies try to make everybody be-_
lieve. If it were_a case of high wages
then it would not be necessary for
whole families to ‘go to work to make a
living where, at one time, the head .of
the house was able to do so. But your
high cost of living comes from high
profits made _by ‘big companies and
-taxes, imposed on the workers by our
government. A ~ ~

High taxes are put on us to build
war machines to kill other workers who
are trying to bring about better living
conditions, and the‘ building of ' war
materials promises bigger profits and

"higher living costs. I say, quit med-
dling in the affairs of other nations
and bring home our young men. Let us
build a better country here at home
and heed the old saying: “Do unto
others as you would have them do unto,

‘ you.”

‘And as to prices and wage controls,
-that is not what we need. It is profit
controls that are '-necessary. When ,a

pa _  small firm I know of can make 20,000’
-‘iv A  3“ dollars yearly in profit on about seven

'- workers I can’t see where there is any‘-
need . for wage freeze. I say, there
should be a profit freeze coupled with
a wage drive. a , .
. V I am certain the workers want peace,
l . full . employment through peaceful
-“trade, and a higher standard of living.

Proposals
To The Editor:

’ I I would like to make a few proposals

according to the things going on now,
in our country and also on other coun-
tries of the rest of the world. We know

~ that peace can be won by negotiating

or coming into an agreement. I believe
the majority of the people in the U.S.
want this more than anything, because
it would~stop the killing and slaughter-

ingof the men, women, and children"

of those countries‘,.and also of the men
of our country. '

The first proposal would be to get
out of Korea, and the second would be
to see what our own people need here
at home. Another proposal is that we
need a wage stabilizatidn board that
would go out and see how the working
man can be helped to win back some
of his own production. Another pro-
posal is that we need firmer price con

trols. , -. '

T Let's get going!
To the Editor: ,

I'm once more writing to the open
forum ; to express my views as to the
national situation thatpconfronts labor
today.

1. Foremost in my mind is war or
peace. Let’s work for peace, we don’t
gaimanything out of war except prob-
ably the shattered bodies of our loved
ones.

2. Let’s stop the present war and
negotiate’ peace with the people of the

world, and bring our boys from Ko- ,
, rea NOW. Working for peace is work-

ing for a better contract.

3. Wage freeze—Anyone but. the
Murray's would not go for such a cock-
eyed formula, who in the H—ll wants
to have 1-ess wages and higher taxes"?

4. As to the new‘ contract, let’s ~ get
all that we can out of it, otherwise
how are we to ‘keep these Wallstreet
bigshotsfrom taking our shirts?

So let’s lift up «our fannies and get
going.

Total conscription

To the Editor:

The people and the governments of
the _United States and Canada now
face the most serious emergency both
at home and abroad.’ This is an emer-
gency which demands the highest
strategy and generalship that it is
possible for this continent to provide.
The day when-the United States and
Canada can blunder their way to vic-
tory in war and evade their social
problemsat home is past.

During World War II, the armed
forces ‘of the United States and Can-

ada fought the armed forces of the '

fascist nations, but they did not de-
feat fascism itself. Likewise, the
armed forces of this continent may
fight the armed might of the com-
but they will not
be able, by this means, to defeat com-
munism as a social ideology.

Nor can a" social idea be defeated
by "a policy of encirclement or block-
ade. The only antidote for both fas-
cism and communism is a social con-
cept which is so superior to either of
them that-they cannot compete with it.

Consequently, an entirely different
approach to the mechanics of conti-
nental operations must be adopted and
an entirely new type of directorship
instituted, if this continent is to avoid
social disaster.

At a time when our natural re-
sources are known to be dvsgindling be-
low the optimum level, we waste them
still further in the practice of a point-
less so-called Limited War. I say
pointless referring to the masses, for
they gain nothing from war except
hunger, misery. and death. On the

other hand we have a few who would

gain materially at least at the pres-
ent, speculating on the blood of inno-
cent people who have been led to be-
is their duty to die,
whether through ignorance or "through
the powerful propaganda machines in
action today.

The only way to offset this is by
Technocracy’s Total Conscription. Then
we shall see who the truly patriotic
North Americans are. By total con-
scription I mean thetaking over by
the government, of men, machines, ma-
terial and money, with national serv-
ice from all and profits to none.

Total conscription has a two-fold
purpose and benefit. It would stop our
big corporation magnates and their
stooges from clamoringfor war, as a.
war without profits would be pointless
to them, and, if we were attacked by
an aggressor (which is highly unlike-
ly) we would be in a position to tax
our war potential to the maximum.

was z'mportm2t enough to be read by-

“Dear Sir:

“Returned herewith is your check

against our sister locals in Mine-Mill.

“Our strikers are receiving wonder-
ful, heartening support from our In-

Smelter Workers and from brother 10-
cals. They could do even more if it

was not necessary to defeat your un--

ion, USA, in its attempt to take over
our membership and disrupt our nego-

“If all the hundreds of thousands of
dollars of Steelworkers’ dues monies
would be used to organize unorganized
workers, hnd to set up a labor-wide
strike and mutual aid fund, we would

probably not be on strike today. .,r

“The best strike support the Steel,

_ Union could give would be an end to

your raids; the organization of the un-
organized workers in your own juris-
diction, and an honest desire to de-
velop labor unity on our common bar-
gaining and political action program.
“We have supported the rank-and-
the Steelworkers in their fights against

file support in» our own‘ battles. When

“The logical consequence/ of this
decision would be for the Department
of Justice to orderthe arrest of ev-
eryone who can be said to have taught
or advocated the overthrow‘ of the
Government. by force or violence. It
would be to throw as many as 75,000
or more people behind bars for their
political and economic beliefs/' After
that might come all those who have
proposed radica-b change -in the Gov-
ernment. Then those who have pro-
posed’ any change. And so on and on.

“Six men have amended the United.
States Constitution without submitting
their amendment to the states for
ratificgtiion. That is the nub of this

Anothér nationally-known news- .

paper attacking the decision was the

- the high ‘Court “has set this nation’s

Truman -criﬁcizied

~ in Senate report

on rail dispute

WASHINGTON-—The Senate labor
committee is sitting tight on a report
by its railroad committee which is
sharply critical of the urgency with
which the Truman administratibn
rushed into recent railway labor dis-
putes and the phoniness of army con-
trol of the carriers. The document
makes the following sensational
charges: °

1. The White ‘house in the person of
John R. Steelman, ‘assistant to the

President rushed into the dispute‘ too

soon. “Presidential intervention in la-
bor disputes,” the report said, “should
only come as a last resort.”

2. The demand of the operating
.bro,therhoodst for a 40-hour week with
48 hours pay was justified. It is the

only large group, not working on a

40-hour week.

-3.‘The relative position of railroad
workers-has fdeclined from 37th place
in 1939 to 64th place in 1949 among
American industries and this was “a
primary cause of and enough -to jus-
tify the" restlessness and discontent
which have marked railroad manage-l
myént-labor relations. during the past
two yearsi”. . 1 . I

 Hitlalloi local in all-(inlet

fight for saielly tlejlnalulls

MULLAN, Idaho——-Miners at the Sun-
set Minerals Mine late last weekwere
pressing for complete victory in their
‘safety fight, after having won a major
part of their demands.

-The c‘ompany had fired five men—-
all .of them leading union stewards-
who had insisted that something be
done about the many safety violations
committed d§ily"on the property. The
entire working force then walked off

.the job, asserting that the company had
in effect engaged in a lockout.

At the request of the union, George
McDowell, Idaho Inspector of Mines,
came ‘up hereand made a thorough'in-

- spection of the mine, after which he»

declared that it was unsafe and or-
dered the company to completely re-
pair and lace up the manway compart-
inentof the shaft to reduce the im-
mediate safety hazards.

McDOWELL ALSO ordered the com-
pany to begin immediately driving two
raises that will provide an additional
and" continuousxmanway-._ exit from the
lower workings to the top station. The
inspector further ordered the company
to correct conditions cited in about a
dozen other complaints m_ade by the
union. . ,_ \ " ‘

z

.The miners agreed to provide the
repair crews that will work on a three-

‘ shift basis. However, they made it clear
2 that they would not resume operations

in the"I'nine_ until agreement. had been
reached‘to reinstate the five men who

were fired because they led the fight

to-’.correct the unsafe conditions. — '

The ‘five unjustly discharged men’
were: Newberry “Porky” Carroll‘, Ron-

ald Utz, Howard Hunt, Frank Schuster
and L. R. Mitcham. The company‘ was
insisting -that the discharge cases
should go to arbitration, but the Sun-
set miners held firm to their position

that arbitration machinery would take

too long to correct the injustice against
the men.

_, The Sunset safety fight was con-
sidered particularlyimportant in the
Coeur d’Alenes, and the victory was
expected to act as an opening wedge
for a broader fight against unsafe
operations at other properties in this
district. . I
