Editorial

We of Frum have long endured the
trials and tribulations of the
racist Fomoco and it°s staff of
bigots along with the racist UAW
How long will racist Ford Motor
Co. and racist U.A;W. be permit-

Ated to wage toggl war on the bl-

ack workers an Itheir. families?
Tokcnism in it's highest form ex
ist at racist Fomoco; like they“
re hiring 6,000 hard core work-
ers when in reality they them-
selves (because they are a part
if the white power structure)
have helped to create the se-ca-
lled hard core. There has also

vbeen quite a number of black fo-

remcn in the D.E.P. .n the last
6 mos. - another form of token-
ism. The racist pigs of this
establishment know and ‘can see
what?s happening at Chrysler so
they are moving in a counter re-
volutionary way. But we of Frum
intend to expose them as counter

\ .

'*true

revolutionists, intent on stopp-
ing Frum, and any other Black
movement thrusting out for free-
dom whether in this country or
another camntry; because racist
Fomoco is all over the world.
Brothers don't be fooled by the
tokenism. of Fomoco it is only
being used to fool the Black Co-
amunity. we are the Black Comm-
unity, and instead of reading
something that-can help us libe-
rate ourselves we read that bull
shitting Free Press or the funky

Detroit News which prints a one '
I All C"’
- these factions are on racist Fo-

sided View of the news.

moco°s side, and we as black as-
sembly workers must decipher the
from the false. We must
’set out‘ to institute Brotherly
love for our black brothers, and

A join together in our thrust for

freedom, equality_and justice.
We owe Ford Motor Company n

thing - it owes us.

DEPT.¢§684 HOOKUP AREA

Racist Johnny Skinflint wiié‘
usual"§

liams is still up to his
tricks of misusing Black Brothers
in the piston hookup area.‘ This
.racist honky knows all the tricks
in the book,‘ work standards are
poor and the conditions
thy. In order to work in the
piston hookup area on line # 2
you have to be, a piece of mac-
hinery so _that you°ll fit in
place. The working_W conditions

””bn line #2 is monstrous and" her-

rible; it is amazing how the bla-
ck brothers stand up under this

type of pressure. But to break
it down for those who shunfBlack-
Power that is precisely how you
are making it, By Black Power
The filthy conditions on line
#2 must be i roved before some -
one is injur d, ‘or the* racist

Fomoco should provide the "black
workers with Extra Pay» for haz-
ardous duty so as
for the filth they work inf Th-
ere is no justifiable means for
these types of circumstances)»

We of FRUM state that under
these present
should be just
the racist U. A. W.

that the racist’ at Fomoco take,
Since there are none, we of FRUM
will take the necessary steps
and provide for our welfare and
insure happiness and lasting se-
curity for our Black brothers.
We will win

RACISM RUNNING AMUCK

Olep racist pig Sam Defalco.
is at it again harrasing and in;
timidating the_Black inspectors}
with $he;supervisors permission,
of course. Sammy, the ,racist
pig does snot_intend to let_the
Eﬂack brothers on inspection
have an inch. There are two re-
lief honkies; Sheppard and Martin,
on line #1 for "ole" pigp sammy
while Black inspectors on. line,
#2 only has one relief man.

.-Now we of FRUM do not intend’

to discriminate against ﬁhoppard
and-.Nartin but _if_line.#1 can
havertwo-relief men then line #2
should qualify also. But as you
have guessed-line #2 is predom-
inately Black therefore pig Sam-
my ﬁoels justified in reaping
havoc on the Black inspectors on
both lines while the honkies get
_the gravy. ~
we of FRUM question this

pig's right to single out Black.
brothers to make examples out of.

we of FRUM say this type of Bull -
shit must stop and will be stop—;;

pod by any means necessary, It

Ole black Jimmie Tucker, the su-
per tom has’ been trying -petty,
hard to intimidate the black wo4'
rkers on lines # 152. A "Stop

Jimmie Drive" is being formed so
that the black workers can have-

peace of mind on the line; “Black

Jimmie°s natural_must come off —
before he is mistaken for a bro-

ther. So we of FRUM have decid-
ed to cut super tom Tudker°s’
hair. Black tom Jimmie has been

seen in the company of tom unit
vice pres., Sam Dunlap ~ maybe
that°s why the brothers recieve

no reprenstation from the local

Committee Room. It is a known
fact that every last committee
man, with the exception of one;
lives in Labor Relations office,
fraternizing with the racist ho-
nkies and toms. Fat Ed, head
racist pig in Labor Relations
smiles with glee everytime Black
Jimmie walks by with the saying
(there goes my black son) in his
mind.‘ To show you how Labor Re-
lations and the union work toge-
ther here is an texcerpt taken
