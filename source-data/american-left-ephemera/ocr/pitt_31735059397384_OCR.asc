will ﬁnd it ditﬁcult to believe that a rich com-
munity, such as ours, having such command over
external nature could have submitted to live such a
mean, shabby, dirty life as we dO.—-WILLIAM MORRIS.

I FEEL sure that the time will come when people

by the labor-time necessary to maintain the

individual adult laborer, but also by that
necessary to maintain his family. Machinery, by
throwing every member of that family on the labor
market, spreads the value of the man’s labor-power
over his whole family. It thus depreciates his labor-
power.—KARL MARX.

’ I ‘HE value of labor-power is determined not only

come either in full panoply of law, and sur-

_rounded with all the blessings of peace, pro-
vided the people have the wisdom to take it by the
hand and introduce it betimes; or it may break in
upon us unexpectedly amidst all the convulsions of
violence, with wild disheveled locks, and shod in iron
sandals. Come it must, in the one way or in the
other. When I withdraw myself from the turmoil of
the day and dive into history, I hear distinctly its
approaching tread.——FERDINAND LASALLE.

’ I ‘HE social revolution is bound to come. It will

ODAY there is no longer any question as to
T whether or not the system of private owner-
ship in the means of production shall be main-
tained. Its downfall is certain. The only question
to be answered is this: Shall the system of private
.ownership in the means of production be allowed to
pull society with itself down into the abyss; or shall,
society shake off that baneful burden, place the land
and the implements of production in the hands of the
people, to be operated collectively, for use and not for
proﬁt, and then, free and refreshed, resume the path
of progress, which the evolutionary law prescribes to
it? Such is the question and such the alternative.
Our generation stands where the road forks. One
path leads, through ruin, back to barbarism; the
other leads onward to the Co-operative Common-
wealth. All political parties in the United States,
with one exception, drive us on to the former—the
Socialist Labor Party alone points the way to the lat-
ter road.—KAUTzKv.
