New bill will be
tested in -courts

If Attorney General Brownell
tries to use the new Humphrey-
Butler Act as a weapon for a
newroffensive ‘against unions, it
would be at least ‘two years be-

fore “ the court fight would be

over. =

That opinion came last week
from Nathan Witt, General Coun-
sel. for the International Union
of Mine, Mill and Smelter Work-
ers. -

Witt pointed out that a hear-
ing before the Subversive Activ-
ities Control Board is a lengthy

procedure, which could last for.

months. Thelﬁorder of the SACB
can then, be appealed in ‘the fed-
eral courts, which ,would take
many more months—‘-and“ pos-
sibly several years.

These legal steps will lead ul-
timately to a series of rulings by
the U. S. Supreme Court on the
constitutionality of the new law's
_ Mean-
time, any union charged with

“infiltratiori”' would carry on as:
usual, with full rights as collec-

tive bargaining, representative.
The ‘labor movement and the
rest of the American people will
be fighting during, this“"period
for repeal of the law. It is a
product ‘of the worst hysteria

since the days of the Palmer‘

raids in the early 19205.

how “Major Medical” works:
_Say that the empl-oyee has a hospital bill of $900,
including surgery of $450’. And say _, that the basic
Kennecott health and ‘welfare program covers‘ only
$450 of the $900. Then the “Major Medical” steps , 
1n the pay of 90% ‘of the balance—-which would be
$405 more, leaving the employee to pay only $45 of
the total $900, hospital -bill. ‘ _. . ‘
, 0 Workers who have been paying’ large amounts - .
into insurancejprograms will nowmake substantial “
savings, not counting -the 9 cent an hour package
won in these negotiations. Examples are the members  *
of ’Bingham'C.anyon Local '485,,who will -save $4.40 
monthly, andﬁmembers of the Arthur-Magna ‘Local ’

O The Company will continue to pay its health
and welfare contributions even in time of strike. .

0 The worker and his dependents cango to the
doctor and hospital of their own choice. They are
not -forced to call on company doctors or hospitals.

. O_The employee gets up to $11 a day hospitaliza-

FAIRMONT CITY, Ill. —— The
International , Union has given
strike s a n c t i o n to ‘Fairmont
Smelter -Workers, Local‘ 82.

The _ request for approval’ of
possible strike ‘action came‘ in a
wire to President John Clark
from Local 82 President -Frank
Bruske. Bruske pointed out that
in spite of nine meetings between
the Local 82 negotiating commit-
tee and the American Zinc-Com-
pany, no monetary offer had been
made. _ ~

“The ‘ next ’meeting,” wired
Bruske, “scheduled for August
31st. In meantime, all prepara-

and were mobilizihg public support for a showdown. -

Efforts by,the Federal Media-
tion and Conciliation Service had
twice ‘failed to bring about a. set-
tlement of the dispute. Only
‘hours before the strike began on
August 23, ‘government concilia-
tors were sending frantic wires
to the union to delay the walk-
out. ‘. Each time, however, they
admitted that they had been un-
able to get the company to agree
to negotiate on any of ' the un-
ionfs demands’ or to offer even
a‘ fraction of a cent counter pro-
posal. The company’s position at
the strike hour was identical to

the position it had when nego-
* tiations opened some two months

ago. ’ -

HAVING FAILED to stop the
walkout, the conciliators,_ set a
meeting for August.24 in Butte.
At» that time they met separately
with the union and the company,
exploring the. opposing positions.
They’, attempted to get the» two

This year has surely been no exception to the com-

has lumped a weapon against unions into thesame ‘basket

The so-called “Communist Control Act of 1954”_ is,

unAmerican, and (2) that every strike is a Communist

 DEBATE on this bill came to a head’-in",Gongress
just as our negotiations were coming to a head in the‘

L industry. At least some of the. larger employers with‘ V

whom we deal were obviously yearning for a chance to
use the new law to block any wage or contract gains for
our members. . . " ‘ =-> ‘ 
But they had to change their minds, for two reasons.
‘First, ou1:,,members\showed—and are stillashowing—that
they are not frightened by this

i  union. The “shoot first—_ask -questions later” "feature of
the original Butler bill was dropped byﬂthe time Congress: .

took final action. T ’ . , V
WHEN THESE two facts became clear, some com-
fa.-niesbegan to make rea1__honest-to-goodness offers at
he bargaining table. A pattern, which the workers of
theindustry could consider atleast adeqiiate, began to‘
emerge. 7
lsfwritten, Anaconda still is hanging tough‘ and refusing
to make any offer at all. We still haye to pin down a, set-
tlement in Phelps-Dodge and AS8211. But at‘?-least ‘we
know the fight will be waged in the normal way, without
the Justice Department sitting‘ on the company side of
the bargaining table,’ ‘ A‘ ‘L V  “

SOONER ~o_r:l;at’er, this-new law meansa bigifight is‘ in it C’

store for us-—a'nd for all the rest of ‘the. labor’ moveinent.
-You can bet an attempt will be made, not so much to de-

‘ stroy our union with -the Act but to‘“pull its teeth, give it

“pro er leadership"-—company-unionize it. .

TUCSON, Ariz.—-A key election for this whole area

was won last week by Mine-Mill. It was at a new copper . ’

mine‘ of Banner Mining Company, a property not organ-
ized before. » _ V

The CID Steelworkers, who opposed us in the NLRB
election, and the Tucson Daily Citizen. ballyhooed the
election—-—before it happened———as\ “a pilot battle for con-
trol of the vast mine. labor forces’ of Arizona.” ‘

A front_-page story-in the Daily Citizen quoted aiCIO ..

“spokesman” as saying: “The election at Banner will have
a far-reaching effect on all of ‘the 16,000 mine workers in
Arizona. Banner at present is a small operation, Just

. - being’ developed, and only about 100; men will be eligible if

. ‘V - ’  
  .   U   \  

to vote in tomorrow’s elec-

tion. But the importance of '

the election .. ." .. lies in the
fact that the huge San

.Manuel and Silver Bell

properties nearby have .yet
to be organized,*yet to
choose a union. There are

0 also about 8,000 miners who

do not yet belong to any
union.” ‘—

_ The$Banne:r mine is ex--

pected to employ 275. when

it is in full production.
The CIO-slanted .ar_ticle

_ also quoted Ken" E;ckert’s

red—baiting of Mine-Mill
before the McCarran com-
mittee and
usual 010 red smear propa-
ganda. ' ' A ._ 

Results of the election

_ were 3

/

Mine-Mill 45 ; C10 Steel

40; V_oid 2. _ _
it There were also 7 addi- .
rtional ballots challenged, 4

by Mine-Mill and 3 by the

~Steelworkers, which, be-

cause of Steel’s refusal to
resolve themat the count,
are holding up a final

NLRB "decision and certifi-

 

other of the

 

cation of Mine-Mill for a
couple of weeks.

‘ A THERE. IS NO WAY in_ g "
the world the Mine-Mill
staff here can figure that .

the Mine-Mill election vic-

. tory can be changed byany

spliteof the challenged bal-
lots. '
There is no doubt what-
ever "that the Mine-Mill
margin of victory was
greater up; to the day be-
fore the election -when the
sensational front—page blast

0 in the Daily Citizen scared

a number of unorganized
workers who had previously
declared their intention of
voting Mine-Mill.
Mill was able to absorb this
attack on the eve of - the
vote and ‘still win.
Inaddition to two succes-
sive splash red-baiting’
blasts in the newspapers
right before the -electi-on,
Steel’s campaign was fur-

ther aided by the Dailys

Citizen’s front-page _pla_y-

_ up with big scare headlines
on the—KeI/inecott strike. At ‘
p the same’ time, Steel was

telling Banner workers that

, if they voted Mine-Mill they

too would “be pulled out on

MINE-MILL’S campaign
was based on a pork chop?
program, unity with the
rest of the workers in the
industry, and exposure of

Steel’s inability‘ to do‘ a job a

for copper miners. /

The Mine-Mill campaign.
was directed by Regional.
