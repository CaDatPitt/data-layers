Public trust must be earned  

George McGovern has devoted his life to earning that trust

Senator George McGovern was born in Avon,

South Dakota, in 1922, the son of a Metho-~

dist minister.

He studied at Dakota Wesleyan Univer-
sity and Northwestern University, where he
received a Ph.D. in History.

During World War II he enlisted in the Air
Force and ﬂew 35 missions as a bomber pilot
ﬂying against the Nazi war machine. He won
the Distinguished Flying Cross for his valor.

At the age of 30 he decided to devote his
life to public service.

He was elected to the House of Represen-
tatives in 1956 as the ﬁrst Democrat sent to
Washington from the state of South Dakota

I

since the 1930’s. He was re-elected in 1958.
In 1960 he became a special assistant to

President John Kennedy, and was the ﬁrst

Director of the Food for Peace Program.

He was elected to the Senate in 1962, and
was re-elected in 1968.

Determined that no child should ever cry
again from hunger in America, he held hear-
ings as Chairman of the Select Committee on
Nutrition and Human Needs and pushed
through important Food Stamp and School
Lunch reforms. ,

He has devoted" himself to the problems
of the family farmer that he has been called
the Senate’s “statesman of Agriculture.”

 

He has opposed America’s military inter-
vention in Vietnam since 1963 and co-au-
thored the McGovern-Hatﬁeld Amendment
calling for total withdrawal of our troops. .

As Chairman of the Democratic Party’s

McGovern Commission on Delegate Selec--

tion and Party Reform, he guided the draft-
ing of new rules which made the 1972 Demo-
cratic Convention the most open, fair, and
democratic of any party in history.

As Democratic candidate for President, he
is carrying on his lifelong quest “to seek and
speak’ the truth,” to further the cause of

peace, and to promote honesty and fairness ‘

in government.

was a small-town Methodist minister in South Dakota who taught his chil-
