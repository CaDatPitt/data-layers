  Mine-Mill to full compliance

 

WASHINGTON, D. C.—-The U. S. Court
of Appeals here has ordered the National
Labor Relations Board to return Mine-Mill to
full compliance with Section 91: of the Taft-
Hartley Act--—retroactive to February 1.

The Court also told the Board to undo
anything it had done against the interests of
Mine-Mill and its members in the period since

~Februa.ry 1.

The order put Mine-Mill back into full
compliance, and means that the NLRB will
have to service all cases brought before it
by Mine-Mill including the long-pending un-
fa‘ir,labor practice charge against Precision
Scientific Co. of Chicago.

The decision by the three—man court——
Judges Danaher, Washington and Bastian—-
was unanimous.

“Maybe the NLRB will now give up its
attack on the right of union members to

choose their own leaders without interfer- .

ence by an agency of the government.” com-
mented Mine-Mill President John Clark. .

“This unanimous decision is just one
more proof that we have been 100% right in
saying the Board proceedings against Mine-

,Mill and Travis were illegal from the start.

. “When the NLRB goes beyond the Taft-
Hartley Act to usurp the functions of police-
men. it puts itself into the business of dig-

ging up evidence and compliant witnesses—-

exactly what it did in the Travis case. One R

of these obliging witnesses was Manning
Johnson, whose chain of falsehoods the Jus-

tice D e p a rt m e n t and the FBI have been

asked to investigate. 5‘

“The NLRB launched its attack on Mine- ,
Mill and Travis at the specific request of an L

employer —— the Precision Scientific Co..of
Chicago. Now the Court of Appeals has told
the NLRB that its job is NOT to take sides
with an employer, but to listen to the com-
peting arguments of union and employer and
then hand down impartial decisions based on
those arguments,” Clark said. *

 bil provides for

prevention, compensation

By ORVILLE LARSON
lnternational Vice President

THERE IS tragedy in the mines -— and
most of it you never read about in the
papers. _

Mines are known as dangerous places
to work. To most people that means the

I threat of explo-

sions, cave-ins,
fires and other
such disasters.
They think in
terms of the big
catastrophes that
make the head-
lines.

There haVen’t
been such “big ca-
tastrophes” in the
non-ferrous mines
recently. There is
another kind of
‘tragedy we do
have — a disease
that kills more workers than these “big
catastrophes” do. I am talking about sili-
cosis. ,

It’s a fact —— more underground work-
ers die of silicosis each year than of acci-
dents, yet you never read about that in
the papers. There is also silicosis in the
mills and smelters. I‘

They don’t put it down as “si_1ico_sis”
on the death certificates. It’s a grim Joke

in mining camps that miners never die of

silicosis. That’s because silicosis brings
on tuberculosis, or heart failure, or some
kind of infection. You will find all these
other diseases on the records but without

‘the silicosis they wouldn’t have occurred.

There is no knowncure for silicosis. It

_ ‘moves inevitably——they call it “progres-

sion” — to death.
Prevention costs money

 IS no known cure-——-but it can

.. be prevented. Proper ventillation and dust
‘ control are the surest preventives.

That takes money——sometimes a lot

-of it. And when lives are cheap it’s not

=_“economic” -(that’s the term they use) to

L . go to all that expense.

I ,The cost of compensation for many
companies is far less than what proper
dust control would cost. That’s why any
realveffort to eliminate silicosis requires
(a) prevention

»mines and other working places, and -(b)
adequate compensation for silicotics which

- will make it “economic” not to have dust
‘ in the mines. ‘

Sound dnd Simple

0  HAT BRINGS all this up is the fact
. that Congressman Metcalf has re-intro-

' duced his Silicosis Bill, HR 2622, in Con-

 

gress andwe should be doing a lot more
to get public hearings on the bill and to
get it passed. _ V I H

Congressman Metcalf’s -bill is both
sound and simple. He proposes that the
Federal government help the states to
meet costs of adequate plans for prevent-
ing silicosis and for compensating its vic-
tims.

Under this bill the U. S. would pay
half the cost -of state “compensation plans”
and “prevention plans” which meet certain
minimum, reasonable standards.

The minimum standards specified in
the bill seem mild enough, yet they are
superior to that which you find in most
mining states. .

Compensation and prevention

THE “COMPENSATION plans,” for ex-
ample, would have to provide for compul-
sory coverage of, all workers exposed to
dust. Benefits for dust diseases would
have to be at least equal to those paid
for accidental injuries? Compulsory re-
porting of all disabilities and deaths due
to dust diseases would be required. And

employers would be forbidden to escape"

responsibility by forcing workers to waive
disability or death benefits.

Also, “prevention plans” would have
to include provision for adequate staffs
to inspect mines and other operations, and
to set standards for dust control. Employ-
ers would have to maintain necessary

equipment and to conform ‘to other re-
quirements to reduce dust concentration.

This bill is already being opposed by
the large corporations and their Congres-
sional henchmen. Their main strategy is
to kill .it —— as quietly as they can. Where,
in spite of their efforts, the bill commands

~- attention, they are raisingthe old dodge

of “States’ Rights.” “Let the States
handle this,” they say, “it’s their job and
they are better able to do it.”

What you can do

‘~HAT THEY really mean by “States’
Rights” is the right.to do little or nothing
about getting rid of silicosis. That’s just
about the way it is now. Our hodgepodge
of grossly inadequate State laws on health
control and compensation is a national dis-
grace. ~-

The Metcalf Bill is a small but neces-
sary step in the right direction. It de-
serves our fullest support.

If you and your local li/:.ven’t already
done so —- get on record in support of this
bill. Write your.Congressmen and let them
know where you stand on this vital meass
ure. Write to Rep. Graham A. Barden,

chairman of the House Labor Committee,

and urge that hearings be held as soon
as possible.

$1 on member for defense

WRIGLEY, Tenn.—A pledge calling for $1 from every Mine-Mill member" in
Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi to the Defense Fund was made by 45 delegates
who attended an area conference here this month.

The all-day parley was held in the new hall of Mine-Mill Local 314, completed"

since the four-and-a-half month strike last year. 'Artie Collins, chairman of Local

314’s committee, welcomed the
delegates and introduced the
conference chairman, Board
Member Alton Lawrence. 1
Speakers at the meeting in-
cluded Asbury Howard, Vice

“P r e s i d e n t; Maurice Travis,

f o r m e r Secretary-Treasurer;
and Charles.Wilson, Int’l Rep-
resentative in Tennessee.

Defense of the union was one
of the key issues before the
parley, which agreed to give

‘ the strongest support not only

to the International officers but
also to the denfense of Travis,
and Clint Jencks (see page 1).
Ali. Grear, financial secretary
of Sloss Red Ore Local 109 in
Bessemer, acted as chairman of
the committee on defense of the
union.

National Lead Council—Sunday, March 13.

Allied Industries Conferenc.e—-Sunday, March 13.

Although the Kennecott Councilwas the only one
actually scheduling two days of meetings, it _was con-
sidered possible that some of the other councils might

also have to go into a_
second day.
President Clark will

gavel the convention to

order at 10 a.m. Monday
morning. There was talk
that the sessions might go
int-o Saturday, March 19,

agenda, which this year in-
cludes not only nomination
of candidates for the bi-
ennial election, but_ also
hammering out a bargain-
ing program.

A panel discussion on
silicosis and industrial dis-
eases was to be one conven-

1 tion highlight, featuring a

prominent West Coast
medical specialist, Mine-
Mill Research Director
Bernard W. Stern, and
Mine-Mill General Counsel
Nathan Witt. Stern re-
cently returned from a
three—day national confer-
ence on silicosis at Saranac

The convention banquet,
which in recent years has
become a major event for
all delegates, will be enter-
tained by the usual per-
formances of talented dele-
gates. A special added
attraction will be the per-
formance of several scenes
from “The Man Who Never

The statement issued by AFL

I ‘Pres. Walter P. Reuther fol1ow- ‘

ing signing of an AFL-CIO
rri'é’P.ger agreement Feb. 9 sets
no deadline for merger but aims
at unification before the end of
1955.

According to the m e r ge r
terms, the‘ agreement must first
_be submitted to the AFL execu-
tive council and to the CIO ex-
-ecutive board. If approved by

, these bodies, a proposed con-

.stitution is to be drafted for
‘the ‘merged federation.

The proposed constitution is!

AFL and CIO top bodies before

going before. the next AFL and_

CIO conventions. Assuming ap-
proval at each step along the
way, the final stage of merger
will then be a joint convention
at which the merged federation
will be established.

The AFL is scheduled to meet
in Chicago Sept. 15 for its 1955
convention. Conceivably, the
CIO 1955 convention could now

be geared in with this, ‘so that
the joint merger convention
could be held by the end of Sep-
tember.

 lnerger ag1°ee1n‘e”nti 

retains inclustrieil principle! 

MIAMI BEACH, Fla.—(FP)-——The detailed merger agreement signed by the AFIJ

and CIO here Feb. 9 gives the leading positions in the pro
the present AFL, but it incorporates some CIO principles. __ .
The agreement specifically provides that the merged federation shall have two*
‘executive officers, a president and a secretary-treasurer, and that initially these
“shall be elected from the unions now affiliated with the AFL.” This means in all
probability that ‘AFL Pres. George Meany and Sec.—Treas. William Schnitzler will”

retain their p_resent jobs.

The agreement begins with a statement of seven principles. The first four state ~.
individual unions will retain their charters, that the “integrity of each affiliated =

union in the merged federation
shall be maintained,” that juris-
dictions shall not be altered and.
thatljurisdictional disputes shall
be handled by persuasion.

The fifth principle states
that “bothicraft and industrial;

7 unions ‘are appropriate, equal.

and necessary as methods of-
trade union organization.” This
was seen as a concession to a
CIO statement that the princi-
ples of industrial organization
should not be’ lost.
0

The sixth principle puts the
merged federation on record in
favor of civil rights for “all
workers, without regard to race,
creed, color, or national origin.”
The seventh states“ that the
merged federation will set up
its own “appropriate internal
machinery” to “protect the
American trade union move-
ment from any and all corrupt
influence and from the under-
mining efforts of communist
agencies and all others who are
opposed to the basic principles
of our; democracy and of free
and democratic trade unionism.”

Within the merged federa-
tions is to be set up a depa.rt-
ment to be known as the Coun-
cil of Industrial Organizations,
Thus the initials CIO———attached
to the Committee for Industrial
Organization 20 years ago and
later to the Congress of Indus-
trial Organizations —— will re-
main in existence.

membership or discriminated

“That Negroes were ready to

‘ October. He testified as an “ex-

Watson admits -he never be-

‘and so was in no position to
put «the finger on Lamb.
The Nat~vig and'Watson re-

heels of anew seri-espof con-
fessions by Harvey Matusow,
iwho was haled before a grand
jury in New York and before
the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee in Washington
as the Justice Department tried
~ to smear him as a “communist
, , plant.” I
7 MATUSOW told the Senate
 group, headed by Mississippi’s
Senator Eastland, that he ques-
tioned the te-.'.imony of Eliza-
. , ibeth Bentley, a key government
,witness in congressional hear-
«ings at which she has named
scores of people as “reds” and
“red agents.”
\ A * -“Miss Bentley, I believe, gave
' . false testimony,” Matusow said.
“I am basing that on conversa-
‘ tions with Miss Bentley and
not on hearsay.”
He‘ also disclosed he was paid
, between $1,200 and $1,400 for
_l speeches in Montana calling
' , Senator Mike Mansfield “a tool
J of the Communist Party,” and
anothter $600 or $700 for
speeches in Washington calling
Senator Henry Jackson a “pro-
Communist.” Both Mansfield
and Jackson are ‘Democrats,
who were elected in the 1952
, campaign despite Matusow’s
J‘ p , speeches.’ M
\ Mounting clamor for. full in-

i Amanda of Rep. Wayne Aspinall
I (D-Colo.) for “re-examination
'=and~reappraisal” of the whole‘
" -poll-*l,cy of using ex—Communists
in hearings and trials. It was
y 6~also;marked by a general re-
view, in niany editorials and
 columns, of recent development
on the ”“pro witness” front. -
 , Alt was recalled that as long

indings in the investigation.

Two other witnesses about

whom the Justice Department

remains silent are Manning

, Johnson and Leonard Patterson.

They testified in June, 1954, at
the loyalty hearing of Dr. Ralph
Bunche, key U. S. official at
the United Nations.

The «loyalty board cleared A

Bunche. In doing so, it reject-
ed the testimony of both John-
son and Patterson. A few days
later, columnists Joseph and
Steward Alsop reported that
the transcript of the Bunche
loyalty proceeding was sent to
the Justice Department for in-
vestigation of possible perjury
by Johnson and Patterson.
THEN a N. Y. Journal-
American reporter said the Jus-
tice Department had cancelled

employment c o n t r a ct s with _

Johnson and Patterson, and also
with two other professional in-
formers,‘ Benjamin Gitlow and
Maurice" Malkin. i

Yet the Justice Department
has taken no steps to undo the
harm done by these “pros” in
the past. As a matter of fact,
Manning Johnson was one of
three “witnesses” who appeared
befpre the NLRB hearing exam-
iner later last summer to testi-
fy against M. E. Travis, then
Secretary-Treasurer of Mine-
Mine-Mill. Johnson readily ad-
i’naitted- to the hearing officer
that he ‘had never met Travis
and that hekknew nothing about
Mine-Mill. Yet he was accepted
as a witness against Travis!

THE SAME Manning John-
son corroborated Paul Crouch’s
false story about Harry Bridges.
He was testifying in the Bridges
trial of 1949—and his testi-

An. iiiiportaiit p‘oint ignored J

in the current discussion is that
thousands of ’ dollars in tax-

» poyers’ money’ is spent by the

FBI and’ the Justice Depart‘-
ment to maintain the. “stable”
of professional witnesses. The
Justice Department admits more
than $75,000 was paidto such
pros in 1953 and 1954.

Of this, $9,675 was paid to
Crouch,“ and $9,096 to Johnson.

‘I was embarrassed’

“If anyone had turned in a
script like that, they would have
called in the paddy wagon.” \

That’s what Mrs. Natvig says
about her own testimony in the
case of Edward 0. Lamb. “I
was professionally embarrassed
that such statements would be
attributed to, me. If I wrote
them as a cub. reporter, I «would
be laughed out of the city
room.” V
( Among the tidbits of testi-
niony given originally by Mrs.

Natvig. was that she had “nes-. -

tled close to his heart in an act
ofvinlfvidelity” _with Lamb in a
Columbus, Ohio, hotel. Actually,
she now says, she never even
talked with Lamwb, but she saw
shim at a. Columbus hotel meet-
ing where “there were some
people who purported to be
Communists”—~about “six or
seven" out of ‘~‘40 or 50” present.

Utah locals ask papers
.‘sef the record straight’  

’ SALT_LAKE CITY, Utah-«Fifty-one officers and
stewards, representing the four Mine—Mill locals in this
area, have demanded that Salt Lake's two dailies admit
they*““contributed to spreading and broadcasting false
testimony against our union based upon‘ the statements
0f a self-confessed perjurer who was the star, ‘friendly’
witness in the McCarran hearings in October, .1952.”

y _ The demand was contained in a letter to the Deseret
News -and the Salt Lake Tribune,.signed by officers and

‘stewards of Bingham Canyon Local 485, Arthur-Magna

Decal 392, Tooele Local 55 and Saltair Local 876.

The letter welcomed an editorial in the Deseret,
News, titled “The Fruits of Falsehood,” and called it “a
public service.” But it went on: e "

A “We were not amazed by

’ the contents of your edi-

to'ria.l=‘ ‘because we have long
known these facts. We
were amazed that a Salt
Lake paper finally recog-
nized”*and printed what our
union has been saying for

many years about ‘paid

professional witnesses’
which were referred to in
the McCarran hearings in
1952 here in Salt Lake as
‘friendly witnesses.’

“Our membership cannot .
forget the blazing, head--

lines quoting -this same
professional witness, Har-
vey Matusow, in both Salt
Lake papers during the
McCarran hearings. Nor
can we forget our unsuc-
cessful efforts to dispute
and refute these lies in the
Salt Lake newspapers and
our refusal, of television
time to answer these

chargesin public,” the let:-_

fer added.
“We know what we are

talking about because our
union has the completed"
and documented record of
every news release issued ,
in this 1952 hearing, and,

some 200 of our members _

were in the court "room as

witnesses to one of ._ he

most shameful one-sided,z»=‘
rigged‘ hearings ever pre-

sented in America.” ’

The letter calls attention ‘

to the editorial comment
that “Every effort must‘ be
made to cle.ar the names
of anyone who has suffered
unjustly because of his
(Matusow’s) testimony,’_’
and it says:

“Shouldn’t we now have
full and public admittance
by both Salt Lake news-
papers that the blazing
headlines, news stories and
charges of ‘strike to sabo-
tage national defense’ so
sensationally displayed dur-
mg the McCarran hearings
have now been proven
false?”

encendido una chispa que esta derrotando a todo testi-

Desde ahora se puede aﬁadir dos mas informadores a lalista encabezada por
Harvey Matusow, los cuales son Marie Natvig y Lowell Watson. Estos dos informa-
dores han admitido que han mentido.

‘La Seﬁora Natvig no solo admite que mintio cuando aparecio como testiga con-
tra Edward 0. Lamb el afio pasado sino dijo que cualquier persona que ere-‘era su tes-
timonio contra Lamb estaba loco!’

"‘Solo un idiota podria poner fe en lo que he dicho,” dijo ella el dia 10 de febrero

a la Comision Federal de Communicaciones, ahora mismo estan decidiendo si re-

vocar las licencias del Seﬁor
‘Lamb para correr una
estacién de Television en
Erie, Pennsylvania.
LOWELL WATSON fue
otro t e s t i g o importante
contra Lamb en la causa
del FCC en octubre del aﬁo
pasado. El testifico como
un ,“.ex.—Comunista” de
Ohio. Ahora Watson admi-
tio que nunca habia perte-
necido al partido Comunis-
ta, y no podria haber estado
en posicion de testificar
contra Lamb.
\ C

Harvey Matusow, quien fue
hecho aparecer delante del
gran j urado enNueva York
y del Sub-Cornite Internal
de Seguridad del Senado en
= Wasliingtoninientras el De-
5 artamento de Justicia
 acia todo
para implicarlo como una
“planta Comunista.”

MATUSOW le dijo a un

1 -'zado por el Senador East-

‘ r

land de Mississippi que él

’ . estabai en duda tocante el

testimonio de Elizabeth ‘
V Bentlﬁy. una testiga mayor

del gobierno en audiencias
congresionales en las cuales
iella nombro a varlos
como “Comunistas” y
“a.gentes Comunistas.”
“La Senora Bentley, yo
creo, ha dado testimoni.o
falso,” dijo Matusow. “Yo
lo digo por conversaciones
que he tenido con ella y no
por rumore,s.”
Se descubrio que él (Ma-
tusow) fue pagado de $1,-

‘ 200 a $1,400 por los’ discur-

.sos en Montana Seﬁalando
' al Senador Mike Mansfield
'como'un “instrumento del

Jackson como “pro-Comu-

,, nista.” Ambos Mansfield y

Jackson son democratas,
que fueron elegidos en la
campaﬁa de 1952 a pesar
de los discursos de Matu-
sow.

El clamor para investi-
gacion de todo “testigo pro-
fesional” fue marcado por
la demanda del Represent-
ante. demo-crata, de Colo-
rado, Wayne Aspinall para
“reexaminacion y reapre-
cio” del costumbre de usar
“eX—Comunistas” en audi-
encias y causas. Esto fue
marcado también por revis-
ta general, en muchos edi-
toriales y columnas, de de-
sarrollos tocante el “testi-

dias después,

ano pasado, e1 Departmento
de Justicia anuncio que in-
vestigaria a Paul Crouch,
el “rey de los profesi6n-
ales,” que ha testificado en
varias causas y audiencias.
El Departamento de Jus-
ticia no hizo nada hasta que
los columnistas Joseph y
Stewart Alsop habian des-
cubrido estos hechos.

Las 19 declaraciones hec-
has por Crouch durante
las varias veces que apar-
ecio como testigo fueron
contradecidas y probado

falsas en 19 declaraciones '

juradas hechas por los
abogados del defensivo
Jacob Burck, el carton-
ista del Chicago Sun-
Times que fue uno de
las victimas de Crouch.
—-Crouch dijo que Harry
Bridges estuvo en una
junta “Comunista” en
-Nueva y York al mismo
tiempo cuando Bridges’
estaba hablando en una
reunion en la costa del

oeste, que fue asistida,

por clenes de miembros
del ILWU!’

——En una causa Crouch tes-
tific_o que no conocia a
un tal llamado David
Davis: en otra causa,
aparecio como testigo

mayor, y dijo que. habia_

estado en varias junta

con el tal llamado -David

Davis.

D’ O

Aunque el Departamento
de Justicia dijo varias
vecas antes que estaba “in-
vestigando” a Crouch no h.a
habido ningun reporte de

lo que hallaron en la inves

tigacion. .

Dos testigos mas que
el Departamento de J ustica
no ha mencion.ado son Man-
ning Johnson y Leonard
Patterson; Ellos testificar-
on en junio de 1954, en una
audiencia de lealtad tocante
el Doctor Ralph Bunche,
oficial mayor de los Estados
Unidos en las Naciones Uni-
das.

Bunche fue pronunciado
libre de culpa por el Con-
sejo de lealtad. Y en pro-
nunciandolo libre rechazo
los testimonios de ambos
Johnson y Patterson. Unos
los colum-
nistas Joseph y Stewart Al-
sop reportaron quelos tras-
untos de lealtad del Doctor
Bunche fueron mandados
al Departamento de Jus-
ticia para ver si era posible
que Johnson y Patterson
hubieran jurado en falso.

Luego un periodista del

J ournal-Americ.an de Nueva

, ..--v’

v-.

York dijo que el Depart-

amento de Justicia habia « "

cancelado contratos p a r a
empleo con Johnson y Pat-
terson, y también de otros
dos informadores profe-
esionales, Benjamin Gitlow
y Muarice ~Milkin.

Sin embargo el Depart-
amento de Justicia no ha
hecho ningun esfuerzo para
remediar el mal hecho por
estos “profesionales.” Como
hecho positivo, Manning

Johnson fue uno de los tres ‘

“testigos” que aparecieron
delante 1 del examinador
durante las audiencias del
NLRB el ano pasado para
testificar contra M. E.

Travis, que entonces era ,

Sec.retario—Tesorero de
Mine-Mill. Johnson de
buena gana. admitio al ofi-N
cial de la audiencia que el
nunca ‘habia conocido at.
Travis y que el sabia nadaL
de Mine-Mill. Sin embargo,
fue aceptado como testigo
contra “Travis. '

El mismo Manning John-
son corro-boraro el testimon-
io falso de Paul Crouch to-
cante Harry Bridges. El

testifico en la causa de
Bridges en 1949—y su
testimonio, junto con el de
Crouch, fueron tirados a-
fuera ultimamente cuando
la Corte Suprema revoco la

-conviccion de -Bridges.

esta es la pregunrta. -.

La verdad es, como dijo el Presidente
Roosevelt en 1933: “Lo unico que debemos
temer es al temor mismo..”_, ,Si no tenemos
miedo de. respaldar a nuestra union y a
, nuestros elegidos lideres democratas en
estos tiempos de ataques entorices no les
» debemos de tener miedo a los patrones.

La razon para las acusaciones del Her-
mano Travis y el Hermano J encks, y de la
accion tomada por el NLRB es solo para
meterle miedo a nuestra miemb1'anza. Si
nuestros miembros tienen miedo, entonces
los patrones no nos tendran miedo en ne-

shuf down mine

“ COPPER MOUNTAIN,
B. C.--Granby Consolidat-
ed has again threatened
closure, in September of
this year, a threat which is
being taken coolly by Local
649.

The feeling is that the
mine will keep producing as
long as it can show a profit,
and this itjis still doing.

One union member, on
discussion of the threat in
the local, made the observa-
tion, “They have started to
bargain early this year!”
This seems tosum up local
opinion.

Vancouver electricians told
to stop local unionmeetings

VANCOUVER, B. C. —-— Fail-
ure to control meetings of Local
213, international Brotherhood

-of Electrical Workers, for the

benefit of the International, has
resulted in a. further measure
of tyranny against the Canadian
members —- abrogation of all
meetings of the local———by order
of J. Scott. Milrie, international
president.

Stating that on reports from
Terry and His Pirates, as this
town calls the Washington
hatchetmen and their stooges,
“organized efforts have been
made to disrupt general meet-
ings . . . including‘ physical as-

sault upon inspectors attempt-

ing to maintain order . . . foul
and abusive language,” etc., the

‘Washington president says he
Ziias authority under the Consti-

tution to withdraw , meeting
"1-iglits, 'and did so as of Feb-
ruary 15. V

’.

I. “This is quite in line~"'with

ylhgeneral policy of the Yankee

Stale l)epartment.,” stated a
member of the local who must
for obvious reasons remain un-

named. “Repress w h e r e you
can't coax or bribe. It shows the

‘" close tie-in between our inter-
" national officers and the foes of

all labor."

The order apparently stems
out oi‘ the last general meeting
on February 7, when an anti-
American curtain made a sharp
division between the rank-and-
file and the International‘ gang,
with the crowded meeting
adopting a form of address for
the chair and the Washington
importers of the most insult-
ing nature. The rank-and—fi1e
turned down every official rec-
ommendation, while Terry, on

his side, ruled out of order every
resolution from the floor.

A resolution calling for Terry
himself to pay for the guard
ordered by himvfor the offices
was ruled out of order by the
importee, who said the bill had
already been paid by the execu-
tive. “You Yankee ...... ..’s hired
him, you pay him!" was chor-
used from the floor.

I

On the other hand Terry and
the executive refused a’ motion
that Gee and his colleagues
under charges should not be
suspended or expelled no mat-
ter what the action of the kan-
garoo‘ court sitting on their
cases, until the charges should
be reviewed at the next con-
vention of the union. This was
ruled out of order.

At another point the ser-
gea.nt-at-arms was asked by
O'Keefe, one of the executive,

to throw a drunk out of the hall.’
“I! I throw anybody down _

those stairs it's liable to be
O’Keefe,” was the reply, and
almost. immediately after one of
the “P i r a t e s” admonished a
member, whom he tapped on the
shoulder, that if he said any
more he might be charged, and
was promptly knocked down.
“Let me have a piece of him,
too,” entreated the m e m b e r
across the aisle, but the “Pi-
rate” slid out from under.

Terry at one point declared‘

that many thousand dollars of
local funds were unaccounted
for. When asked to name names,
and supply details of the fan-
tastic figure he cited, he re-
fused, whereupon one of the
members not hitherto regarded
as strongly opposed to him, de-
clared: —« C

local. If anyone has signed

have been that rat sitting beside ‘ “

lost what dwindling support re-
mained for Terry among the
rank-and-file. -at - the ~- -meetings,
and from then on the division

was clearly drawn between ex- -

ecutive and members.

Calgary local I
wms fight for
higher pension

CALGARY, Alberta-—
Mine-Mill Local 800 has
won another disability pen-
sion fight, the second in a
month. ‘

Mike Szuks, a member of
Local 800, was injured in
a crane accident three
years A ago. Since then he
has spent most of his time
in various hospitals. Last
fall, treatment was discon-
tinued and Szuks was
granted a partial disability
pension of. $30 a month.

The union appealed the
decision, arguing that
Brother Szuks could neith-
er live nor afford treatment
on $30 a month.

The compensation board,
following the appeal. in-
creased the pension to $103
a month and continuation
of medical treatment. '
