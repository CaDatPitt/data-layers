iC1ark Opposes New

 Business Tax Credit  

.WASHINGTON, D. C.—Mine-Mill President John
Clark told Congress last month that, lacking an_ ade-
quate public policy of mounting unemployment, addition-
al tax incentive for business ‘‘is a flagrant case of putting

the cart before the horse.”

In a statement presented
before the House Ways and
Means Committee, Clark ex-
pressed the union’s opposition

to the tax credit proposed by-

the Administration to spur
modernization and , expansion
of plantand equipment.

“No labor organization re-

. sponsive to the needs and in-

terests of its membership can

support such a proposal,” he
said.

HE SAID Mine-Mill can sub-

scribe to the passage in Presi-

dent Kennedy’s tax, message

referring to the fact that both

A ' benefits and hardships result

from capital expansion and
modernization. “We most cer-
tainly agree with the Presi-
.. dent,” Clark added, “when he
says that _‘this places heavy re-
sponsibilities on public policy
. . . to ameliorate hardships
when they occur.’ " . '

The union opposes this tax
legislation beca-useof “the very

I . evident lack of public policy of
» the sort which the President

. dimensions

‘calls for,” Clark said.

’ “There has been no mean-
ingful and adequate“ public
.policy to cope with the prob-
:_lem of mounting unemploy-
ment,” Clark said. He pointed
out that it is a problem whose
“have been ‘omi-
nously increasing for most of
the "past decade——a problem
arising in major part from the
very force of automation to
which the President now calls
upon, the Congress to give
“what is hoped. would be power-
ful stimulus in the form of ad-

‘ . ditional tax incentive.”

HE CRITICIZED the gov-
ernment’s executive branch for
touting recent record high lev-
els of U. S. employment; when
“the significant thing is not

crease in jobs has been slow-
ing down, while there has been
a more than proportionate in-
crease in the generalp'opula-

tion and in the size of the la:

In this connection, Clark re-
ferred to U. S. Labor Depart-
ment figures projecting an in-
crease of 14 million in the la-
bor force during the 1960’s, an
increaseimore than 12/3 times
as great as in. the 1950’s.
do “The economy faces the
task,” ‘he ’said,’."‘not only of
providing jobs for these addi-
tional people, but, let us hope,
of achieving a substantial re-
duction in the ranks of the un-
employed.”

THE MINE-MlLL_ UNION

President's Corner

Problems Raised by

i Industry Curtailment

HE UNOFFICIAL returns of the International ref-

erendum on the raise in minimum local dues and per
capita to the International show that this proposal has
lost. These returns, of course, are subject to the decision
of the constitutionally -elected canvassing committee
which convenes in Denver on June 19th.

to the membership was lost, particularly
after the open discussion on thismatter by
the elected delegates at the convention who
supported it by nearly a unanimous ma-
jority.

The only reaction that one can have is
the lack of sufficient contact with the aver-
age member, who, without any doubt, is
happy with the accomplishments on the bar-
gaining front as it covers wages and welfare
conditions, but to whom the full force of
the ever-rising costs to make these gains

 

Clark
has not been brought home. ‘

With the curtailing of the industry, the knowledge of the
ever-increasing workload on the International staff and Re-
search Department in handling disputes and grievances cannot
have been brought" sufficiently to the attention of the member-
ship as a whole.

*‘A'*

HE INTERNATIONAL office is flooded with queries from
locals about disputes over seniority because of layoffs and
problems involving recalls. Many of these go to arbitration,
bringing in the research or the legal staff of the International.

The attitude of the employers, no doubt encouraged by the
ever-growing pool of unemployed, and their rabid‘ attitude on
speed-up, all this coupled with automation creates more prob-
lems for the International staff and increases their workload.

The necessityto follow through in legislationaffecting our
membership on the metals industry, mine safety, earlier retire-
ment for miners, and social legislation makes it imperative that
we maintain an effective lobby in Washington.

‘A'**

T, OF COURSE, is true that industry can dispense with

workers in periods of depression; but, as I have pointed out,
a union's workload increases at such times. I am sure from the
response of the convention delegates that they fully understood
this.

Organization must be carried on. We have just taken back
our rightful jurisdiction at Inspiration in Miami, Arizona, and
are moving on other fronts. This takes manpower and finances.
This union, even with the curtailing "of membership by industry,
cannot cut down on its forces to any degree.

If we are to operate for the welfare of our membership, and
to continue to fight for further gains, as we must in the coming
Kennecott negotiations, the finances must be forthcoming to
do this.

‘A'**

A E ARE NOT isolated in this. All unions, from the top

AFL-CIO down to its affiliates, are and must take action
to meet the onslaught against the worker.

Those who have followed the results of automation,‘ speed-
up,_and the ever-increasing imports from low wage countries,
realize that the only impact against the reverse conditions .this
creates for labor is an active fighting union.

Today more than ever the role of the divider, the raider,
the anti-union termite and those who for no other seen purpose
than to please the boss in promoting opposition to the general
fight of the union, should be brought out in the light. The
stupid mouthings of these characters is easilyunderstood. Their
obvious purpose is to benefit themselves, and their attitude is
“to hell with unions or organized labor.”—JOHN CLARK.

It was a little surprising that the appeal .

Morenci 1 Local 616

Aids "Boys' State"

For the sixth straight year,
Morenci, Ariz., Miners Union
No. 616 has sponsored the
sending of two high school
boys (one each from Morenci
and Clifton) to the Arizona
“Boys’ State” meeting, a jun-
ior citizens event.

The choice from Morenci
High this year was Leonard
Peete, son of Mr. and Mrs.
Alexander Peete. Leonard is
an outstanding student. His
father, Alex, was an active
member of the Mine-Mill
Morenci Miners Union and is
remembered with respect for
his work as picket captain dur-
ing the 1955 and 1959 strikes.

In the case of Clifton High-

selectees this year, Robert
Locke and Daniel Martinez
were co-sponsored by Local
616 and the American Legion.

Here's One "Blue
Print for Action"

The following is excerpted
from a recent leaflet issued by
Mine-Mill Local 593 at Ameri-
can Brass in Buffalo, N.Y.:

“The Company has a new
‘gimmick’ called
for Action’ which asks for
‘ideas’ to help the company
eliminate jobs. The Union has
a very good suggestion for the
company:‘ Stop’ the speedup!
Stop doubling up jobs! Stop
yanking workers from their
jobs! Go out in the field and
get some business!

Charleston Strike Aid Urged  

 

CHARLESTON, S. C.-—Fi-
nancial aid is being asked-for
Mine-Mill Local 863 members
who struck the Planters Ferti-
lizer and Phosphate Company
here Jan. 30 when management
refused to make any contract
offer after several months of
negotiations.

Int’l Secretary-Treasurer Irv-
ing Dichter last month sent an
appeal to all Mine-Mill locals
urging strike aid for the
Charleston members. He point-
ed out that although Mine-Mill
has contracts in South Caro-
lina and Georgia-with 17 com-
panies producing the same
product, Planters is the only
one that has refused to nego-
tiate a settlement. ‘ ‘

Manageemnt here has stated
that regardless aof settlements
with . the other companies,
Planters would anot 1gl?.ant:_a.ny

of Local 863's demands*"even
[though they could well afford

it. The Planters minimum pay
is six cents: an hour less than
the other companies.

PLANTERS has used such
strike-breaking ‘tactics as send-
ing buses each day into rural
areas to employ scabs from
among_the unemployed, includ-
ing farmers to whom the com-
pany has extended credit. Dep-
uties meet the buses at the
county line and escort them to
the plant. Despite this, nor-

mal production has remained

nil to _date.

Latest Box; Score

DENVER—Months ago the Steelworkers, with much
fanfare, launched all-out raids which were supposed to cul-
minate this Spring with a wholesale take-over of Mine-Mill
operations throughout the country.

Spring has come and gone along with countless thou-
sands of dollars spent by the Steelworkers in the raids.
Their batting average ‘in the latest box score is exactly

ZBPO.

Steel’s months-long raid on AS&R Local 625 in Balti-
more, Md., is dead. The same goes for their drive on Local
890's‘ Kennecott jurisdiction at Santa Rita and Hurley,

New Mexico.

Their attempt to petition at the Local 117 Anaconda
smelter. in Anaconda, Mont., was thrown out by the NLRB.
They have abandoned their campaign for the over-all mine,
mill and smelter jurisdiction of Local 937 in San Manuel,
Ariz., intervening instead on the IAM’s futile petition to
carve out the mill and smelter alone. Even their unfair
labor charges against Local 937 president Fred Sanchez

were dropped.

It was a strikeout for Steel in their abortive move on
Local 485 at Kennecott’s open pit in Bingham Canyon,
Utah. After almost a solid year of raiding, they have
also been unable to petition against Local 392 at the Ken-
necott mills in Arthur and Magna, Utah.

Arizona Smelter Leaders
Confer on JobsProblems

DOUGLAS, Ariz.—A shorter work week and earlier

retirement were among issuesdiscussed here by delegates»

from six Mine-Mill locals representing smelter workers
at an all-day conference April 30 in the Gadsen Hotel.
The smelter meeting, first of its kind in the state, con-

cerned itself mainly with
increasing work loads and
the elimination, combination
and disappearance of jobs.
Discussion centered on reme-

Negotiations Underway with Kennecott

Analysts noted that with
Kennecott’s production back at
about 34,000 tons per month,
each one-cent increase in the
price of copper means an in-
creased profit to the company
of $20 per ton, or a total of
$680,000 per month.

Thus, copper price increases
announced just last month are
worth more than 1% million
dollars every month in addi-
tional profits to Kennecott.

‘THE MINE-MILL UNION

June. J1 961

Vice-President:

Referendum   Typified  

Democracy of Union

UR UNION has just completed its membership refer-
endum held every two years. The unofficial but
almost complete returns from the local unions show
that the per capita tax amendment was defeated and
the contests for Board member in Districts 2 and 7 are
-. very close. Apparently, I have been. re-
elected by a substantial margin. The Can-
vassing Committee, of course, will re-check
all local union tabulations and announce the
official result when they complete their
work later in June. ‘
As in any election contest, the results
a.re satisfying to the supporters of the win-

   

whose candidate was defeated—but this is
the ‘nature of democracy._ We cannot prac-

union without some pain and some struggle.

Skinner Despite the pain and struggle the democratic

process in Mine-Mill is, and has been for over ‘a half a century,

a healthy and vibrant quality of this union. ‘ . -
Most of us are genuinely disappointed_that the proposed

amendment to increase the operating and strike funds of the

union did not carry~—but it was the decision of the .member-

ship and must be accepted.
 J * s ‘k - ‘Ir
T IS perhaps remarkable that this issue received such wide-
spread support. Mine-Mill is one of the few unions in North

America that has. always submitted its financial proposals tora _

referendum vote.-

Can you imagine what would happen in our; democratic .

elections in Canada and the United S_tates if all _t_ax'_iucr.ea-ses
were submitted to the‘ people~in a referendum  ‘approve or
disapprove? ' ‘ '

If the people controlled the purse s,trings,'as;jtl_rfe‘ member- .-

ship in Mine-Mill-_ does, our taxes would certainl'y'_'b’eeifarless,

‘thanthey are today—and the tax burden gwouldeprobably be

far more equitable.’ ’ ~ . '  ‘ - ,. ‘
. .. . * _ * * . b _ . A

‘ UR International Convention in March adopted an aggres-

sive program for théimmediate future of our union. The‘,
new‘ Executive Board will be confronted with the, task of .

advancing this program while at the same time reducing oper-

_ ating expenses and conserving our financial resources.

It will not be an easy job. ‘It is vital, however, that the
union increase its activity in fields of bargaining, organization,
political and legislative work, civil rights .and trade union unity.

_ This program laid down by the Convention must be put,
“into effect. I am ‘confident the Executive Board will find the

means and the method to do so. . .
- ‘Ir * ‘A’ _ .
Q T NO time since the great depression of the Thirties has

the trade union movement been faced with such serious.

challenges as it is today. The problems of permanent mass
unemployment, automation, the ups and downs of the business
cycle and the increasing belligerence toward all unions by big
business can no longer be ignored by organized labor._

In the face of these important issues, invasion of the es-

tablished jurisdiction of other -unions, raiding and cut-throat
competition inside the American labor movement is just plain
suicide. A return to the fundamental principles of trade union
unity is now essential. — ,

American labor must revive the slogan of “an injury to
one is an injury to all” and start practicing it. Mine-Mill must"
use its resources and influence to join with any and all unions
who believe that morality and sanity and brotherhood must be
returned to organized labor. J

*'‘*.‘k

HE STRESSES and strains of a democratic election contest -

are now behind us. Whether we like it or .not——it’s'the
membership that made the decision. Let us all now "unite in a

' - ‘ common effort to get the job done that’s ahead of us.

I want to assure my opponent in this election, the new
Executive Board and. the entire membership in the’United States
and Canada that I ,will do everything possible to contribute to
the advancement of the interests. the welfare and the program
of our union in the period ahead.—-AL SKINNER.

Peace, Disarmament Plea
Theme of Labor Parleys

Peace and disarmament were stressed as vital needs
of the world’s people at two major conferences last
month of top labor, church and civic groups.

In Washington, D. C., President Walter Reuther of
the United Auto Workers told the 7th National Confer-

ence on World Disarma-
ment that “the only war
we can win is the war ‘against
poverty, human disease and
low living standards.” .

Reuther said that in this
nuclear age “the old idea of
alternatewar and peace is ob-
solete.” The United, States, he
said, has destructive power the
equivalent of 10. tons of TNT
for’, every man, woman and
child.in the nation, and Russia
ha-sa like amo_unt.

Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D.,
Minn.) called for strengthen-
ing the UN, declaring: “There
is hope for world disarmament

because there "is no hope with-3

out it.” ‘ 1
Among the unions sponsor-

ing the conference were the"

DENVER — Mob action:

against _Americans exercising
their constitutional rights was

strongly condemned as -“a dis- V

Mill’s top officers May 22 in

V _telegrams to ‘President. Ken-

_ Abernathy,‘ pastor of Mont-
'gomery’s First Baptist Chu-rch

P which was beseiged by_the_;

same mob on Sunday, May 21.

(Rev. Abernathy, a leader of

the struggle for integration in

. the South, was one of the prin-

‘- cipal speakers at Mine-Mill’s
56th convention in Tucson.)

Both the mob ‘assault at the

Montgomery bus station and ;

attack on Rev. Abern'athy’s
church were denounced in the
wires to President Kennedy
and Gov. Patterson.

The wire to Kennedy ex-
pressed support for “all the
steps you have taken to date

to assure adherence to the Con- -

stitution of the United States
in the State of Alabama.” It
also urged the President “not

' to.hesitate. to exercise all pow- .
7. ers inherent in your office to.

‘safeguard the lives and rights
" of those who seek tolive and
act as Americans.”

 

The messages were signed.
by President Clark, Vice Presi-

dents Howard and Skinner, and

THE MINE-MILL UNION

June. 1961 V

l1_lS'l'RlC'l' l BOARD MEMBER ERNEST SALVAS testifies before Montana Safety Code Committee at hearing
in Butte May 25 on proposed minimum safety standards for mining, quarrying, milling and smelting op-
erations. Saated at table, from left, are Committee members Dan Martin, Butte Miners Union No. I; Dr.
Edwin Koch, chairman, President of Montana School of Mines; Martin Hannifin, Anaconda Company mines

manager; John Bly, American Chrome, Company superintendent.

Anaconda Sme|termen’s local H7 was not present.

Salvas Cifes Coverage Gaps
In Proposed   Montana Code

BUTTE, Mont.—-—-Mine-Mill District 1 Board Member Ernest Salvas, ‘in a second-
appearance in less than seven months before the Montana Safety Code Committee,
again blasted this state advisory group.

Echoing charges he made at a public hearing here November 3, Salvas told the
committee at a public hearing here May 25 that the comrnittee’s rejection of a very

I substantial proportion of

the recommended material
submitted to it by Mine-Mill
and its Montana locals had the
effect of leaving “the proposed
draft code with serious gaps

- in coverage, particularly as to

milling, smelting and refining

operations.”

iLEVELING his guns at the
committee, on which labor rep-

- resentatives Dan Martin of

Butte Local 1 and Eugen-e Cor-
coran of Anaconda Local 117
are outnumbered 3 to 2, Salvas
said more than half of 30 Writ-
ten recommendations submit-
ted to the committee early last
year by Montana Mine—Mill lo-
cals were rejected.

Of more than '50 suggestions
offered last November, more
than ‘ninety per cent were
thrown out by the board. La-
ter, in December, he said Mine-
Mill and all of its Montana 10-
cals had submitted typewrit-

ten recommendations running ,

to 42 pages, of which the com-
mittee had rejected more than
'75 percent.

Salvas closed his statement

urging that the committee-

bring the proposed Montana
mine safety code into line with
commonly accepted s a f e t y
standards. These included the
radiation safety code of the
American Standards Associa-
tion, the gas, dust and fume
control standards of the Public
Contracts Division, U.S. De-
partment of Labor, and U.S.
Bureau of Mines standards for
underground operation of dies-
el engines.

He pointed out that such ac-
tion was required by laws now
on the statute books in Mon-
tana.

MINE-MILL spokesmen par-
ticipating at the hearing with
Salvas included:

Reginald Beavis, John Glase, ~

Bill Gately and Louis Sopko
of Butte Local 1; Art Clausen
and Glen Johnson of Great
Falls Local 16; Owen McNally
and Heber Briggs of Anacon-
da Local 117; and Int’l Reps.
George Kalafatich and Joe
Dunne.

"Upon recess of the hearing

‘the Committee chairman an-

nounced that the record of the
previous hearing, the record
of this hearing and all materi-
al before the Committee would
now be considered by the Com-
mittee, and that a recommend-
ed Code would be submitted to

 ‘-'jective~_would be achieved be-.

Key Witness in Textile  
‘Conspiracy’ Case Arrested

HENDERSON, N. C.——I-Iarold E. Aaron, key wit-
ness in sending eight Textile Workers Union leaders to
jail for “conspiracy,” has been arrested on charges of
shooting a man in a Virginia motel. Imprisonment of the
eight followed their conviction, mainly on Aaron’s testi-

mony as an undercover
agent for the North Caro-
lina State Bureau of Investi-
gation, in connection with the
Harriet - Henderson 1: e xtile
strike here.

With Aaron in the motel
was a 17-year-old girl. His ar-
rest set off renewed pleas that
N. C. Gov. Terry Sanford re-
open the case of the Textile
unionists. Two of the state's
leading newspapers, the Ral-
eigh News-Observer and the
Charlotte Observer, joined the
pleas.

Aaron’s arrest, the News-
Observer declared editorially,
“cannot increase the State's
confidence in the righteous-
ness of the conviction.” It re-
called that the union men were
jailed for “conspiracy to dyna-
mite” -even though “no dyna-
miting took place."

il= IR '8

THE editorial added that
Aaron, paid “with State ‘funds,
helped prepare the alleged
plot in order to betray those
whom he involved in it. Any
verdict of guilt based upon the
testimony of a paid informer,
who was given money to ar-
range entrapment, deserves
special scrutiny.”

Textile Workers President
William Pollack said the ar-
rest of Aaron “should cause
North Carolinans “to a sk
whether eight union men with-
out any previous- criminal rec-
ords belong behind bars solely
upon the testimony of Aaron.”

Gov. Sanford is reportedly
giving “serious consideration”

to reopening the case.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -
Still another union has

A U. S. District Court

. jury here May 19 found
the United Mine Workers
guilty of “conspiracy” to
violate the Sherman An-

being appealed.

A The 5-week trial in-

> The jury ruled the

company was entitled to

$90,000 damages. Under

ages are tripled. If -the
verdict is upheld in high-
er courts, the union will
have to pay $270,000 plus

Schnaittacher Gives Labor’s View
At State Public Health Meeting-

GRAND CANYON, Ariz.—-Mine-Mill Phelps Dodge Council Coordinator Sylvain
Schnaittacher-was a guest speaker here May 17 at the Annual Convention of the Ari-
zona Public Health Association.

Schnaittacher, who also serves as Business Agent of Copper ‘Queen Miners Union
shared the platform with speakers from management.

Local 551 at.PD‘in Bisbee,
These included representa-
tives from the Kennecott
Copper Corporation, V all e y
National Bank and El Paso
Natural Gas. -Company.

The subject of the labor-
management symposium was

“Metropolitanism —— a New
Frontier in Public Health.”
* =l= 3l=

COVERED in the discussion
was the impact of the growing
population in the West on pub-
lic health services and the
whole problem of sanitation,
water supplies and medical
and hospital care.

Schnaittacher presented la-
bor’s point of view, emphasiz-
ing the need of medical: care
for the aged, the development
of hospital and medical plans
for workers, and the fight
against rising medical costs.

The plans won by Mine-Mill

V for Kennecott and Phelps. -

 

Dodge workers were pointed

out as being milestones in the

program of prepaid medical

care. '

THE Mine-Mill spokesman
also stressed‘ the relation of
the fight for civil rights to the
problems of public health. A

“People who are denied
equal opportunity and are
forced into low paid jobs, sub-

standard housing and unsani- _

tary slums are just not going
to be healthy people,” Schnait-
tacher said.

His talk was followed by a
question and answer period
during which there was con-
siderable discussion of the in-
adequacies of the Arizona In-
dustrial ‘Disease Act, with par-
ticular reference to silicosis.

 Schnaittacher said many use-
ful contacts were. made for fu-

  

ture ‘cooperation of the union
on health and disease and acci-
dent problems.

FEDERAL GRAND JURY probe of possible anti-trust law
violations by the brass mill industry got off to a mysterious
start in Hartford, Connecticut on April 17 and promptly ad-
journed.

Voluminous records of Anaconda American Brass Company,
Chase Brass and Copper Company, Phelps Dodge Copper Prod-

ducts Company, Bridgeport Brass Company, Revere Copper and

turers were subpenaed by the government.

Speculation has it that the delay in the Grand Jury’s in-

British Columbia Mining Boom
Includes Major Copper Projects

VANCOUVER, B. C.——British Columbia is experiencing a mining boom. Already
announced for expenditure in 1961 is over $40 million for metals development which
will add nearly 15,000 tons per day milling capacity to the present 25,000‘ tons daily ’
Major metal projects

capacity, and greatly expand mining activity in the province.

under development include iron, copper and tungsten.

On Vancouver and Queen
Charlotte islands, two iron
mining companies controlled
by Noranda Mines and Granby
Mining Company, Ltd., are
preparing to go into produc-
tion. Iron ore concentrates will
be sold to Japanese steel mills.

=l< =3: =l<

BIGGEST copper project is
Craigmont Mines, inland from
Vancouver about 200- miles.

Craigmont, with expected
production of about 30,000
tons of copper per year, has
been approached by Japanese
smelters -for its output, and
also by American Smelting
and Refining Company, which
is reported to wa.nt Craigmont
concentrates for its Tacoma
smelter.

Craigmont may not have
any concentrates for export;
bills are now pending in both
the British Columbia and Do-
minion parliaments to‘ assist
in financing a Canadian cop-
per smelter.

Miners in
Chile Hit
Cost Cuts

SANTIAGO, Chile —— The
Chilean miners union last
month warned against elimina-
tion of jobs throughcompany
cost—cutting. The action came
at a four-day meeting here of
delegates to the second Con-
gress of the 16,500—member
Chilean Copper Workers Con-
federation. _

In a resolution aimed direct-
ly at the Kennecott and Ana-
conda companies, the copper
miners union said it would
not accept the discharge of
workers for the sake of lower-
ing the companies’ costs.

The resolution declared that
“strong action” would be taken
if this occurred.

OTHER principal resolu-
tions adopted by the Confeder-
ation:

Foreign Wage Rates

Here are some average wage rates for mining and metal
producing and’ fabricating workers in foreign countries, mostly

"fo’r"1958fa1=Id 1959, -which have appeared recently in “Labor De-

velopments Abroad,” issued by the U.S. Department of Labor:

. _ Wages (U.S.
Country Industry Equivalent)
Burma V 9 tin & tungsten mining 91 '/zc per day
Colombia basic metals 18 ‘/20 per hour
Formosa metals manufacturing 68'/zc per day
Italy metal mining 36'/zc per hour
Japan mining $1.07 per day
Japan non-ferrous metals $1.16 per day
Peru, Lima metals manufacturing $1.14 ‘/2 per day
Peru,fArequipa metals manufacturing -800 per day
Venezuela mining $7.74 per day

It’s wages like these that make it possible for foreign mines
to _push U.S. mines out of the American metals markets, and
which make it profitable for Japanese copper smelters and re-
fineries to bid concentrates and scrap away from other buyers.

critical need for the creation
of more than 20 million new
jobs in this decade . . . more

than three times the increase

in civilian employment in the
1950’s.”
Neither the Administration
nor Congress, Clark. declared,
-has so far shown_ any real ap-
preciation of “the appalling
magnitude of this problem”
pointed up right now by Labor
a>Department estimates that
seven million new jobs will be
needed in the next year to take
‘care of new entrants to the
labor market and to bring
about a reduction in the rate of
unemployment to 4 per cent.

On the contrary, he said, the ‘

Administration 0 p p o s e s a
shorter work week and a
broadly-based tax cut, holds a
tight‘ reign on non-military

. spending, and is even reported

to be considering a retreat
from the long-overdue long-
range overhaul and improve-
ment of unemployment com-
pensation benefit levels.

“IN circumstances like this,
to propose, as the Administra-
tion has done, that there be
adopted a program of tax in-
centives to hasten the process
of automation, to speed up the
displacement of millions of
workers and to swell the ranks
of the technologically unem-

ployed is a flagrant case of.

putting the cart before the
horse,” Clark told the House
committee.

Far more workers would be
displaced as a result of the
program than the estimated

>» 500,000 to be temporarily en.-

gaged in building and install-
ing the new plant and equip-
ment,”.he said. -
Instead of a “trickle-down”
program of tax incentives to
new investment, Clark suggest-
ed “putting first things first”
with another form of tax in-
centive “whose effect would be
certain, immediate and direct”
toward creating “the condi-
tions ,under which businessmen
could increase output and em-
ployment, and invest, where
-necessary with confidence.”
This, he said, would be an-
_ thorization to the President to

Food Stamp

  Plan Launchecl - »

In Bu-H-e Area

BUTTE, Mont. —— Silver Bow-

C o u n t y was scheduled to
launch its pilot food stamp
,.program June 1 under the Ag-
riculture Department’s plan to
provide a better diet for needy
persons. Silver Bow is one of
seven test areas designated by
the Department for the plan.

Two Mine-Mill local unions »

are centered in the county-
Butte Miners Union Local 1
and Melrose Mine, Mill &
Smelter Local 904. 3

Under the plan, the govern-
ment will issue stamps to
needy persons who can use
them to buy food at cooperat-
ing stores. The stamps permit
recipients to obtain a wider va-
riety of foods than now avail-
able under the present distri-
,bution of surplus commodities.

THE program is expected to
pump an estimated $70,000
vmonthly into this area’s retail
“food business. - ~ .‘ ~ ’ -

It will benefit not only the
food dealers, but approximate-
ly 4,000 men, women and chil-

dren now on general relief or '

taxes for as long as such ac-
tion is needed “in conjunction
with other measures to achieve
the stated objective of the Em-
ployment Act of 1946 of ‘maxi-

In conclusion,’ Clark
pressed Mine-Mill's support of

President’s tax message in

revenue by tightening of exist-

Nothing New

WASHINGTON, D. C.——So-
cial Security medical care for
the aged is nothing new in the
world—59 nations provide it.
Germany was the first to in-
troduce such government

health insurance, in 1883. All .

European countries except’Fin-
land now provide some kind
of government health and ma-
ternity program.

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)
WASHINGTON, D. C.-—The Senate, just before Me-
morial Day weekend, passed President Kennedy’s $2.5
billion public school aid bill after eight days of debate in

which Administration leaders defeated anti-segregation

and church school aid amendments as well as other pro-

posed changes.

The controversial meas-
ure, approved in the Senate
49 to 34, is headed for a hotter
fight in the House where a
similar‘ bill has been approved
by the Education and Labor
Committee. House floor action
was expected to begin the
week of June 5.

The bill is one of five given
top priority by the Kennedy
administration in its 1961 leg-
islative p 1- o g 1- a m. Already
passed by Congress and
signed into law by the Presi-
dent are federal aid for de-
pressed areas and minimum
wage legislation. Still up for
action are the multi-billion
dollar housing program. a.nd
medical care for the aged un-
der social security.

Civil rights legislation, at
least as far as administration
drive is concerned, appears to
be a dead duck for this ses-
sion.

* >11 *

UNDER provisions of the
Senate-passed aid-to-education
bill, the $2.5 billion in federal

grants would be made avail- '

able over the next three years,

starting July 1, to be used as

the states -see fit for teachers’
salaries, school building con-
struction or general operating
expenses such as bus transpor-
tation, textbooks, libraries and
clerical services.

Grants would be allocated
by a complex formula based
on student population and
per capita income in each
state. The sliding scale grants

 

JUNE 1961

would range from a low of
$9.62 per pupil in Connecticut
to a high of $27.77 for such
“poor” states as Mississippi,
South Carolina and Arkansas.

The fight over the compan-
ion bill in the House is expect-
ed to center on the question of
using federal funds for teach-
ers’ salaries, a provision
which was dumped by the
House in a similar measure
last summer.

II‘ It IR

EARLIER in the m onth,
President Kennedy signed the
much-debated minimum wage
bill, representing a ’ moderate
victory for the administration.
By dint of last minute pres-
sure in the House, a fairly re-
spectable bill was salvaged. It
goes into effect on Sept. 3.

For workers already cov-
ered by the Fair Labor Stand-
ards Act, the minimum wage
will go to $1.25, to be reached
in two steps over two years.

On the all-important issue
of new coverage, 3.6 million
new workers, mostly retail
trades employees, .were given
lwage-hour protection. How-
ever, the newly covered work-
ers are to reach the $1.25 min-
imum and the standard 40-
hour workweek in three steps
stretched over four years.

In the final maneuvering for
the bill’s passage, some 140,-
000 low-paid laundry workers
and'300,000 hotel and restau-
rant workers were eliminated
from the law’s coverage.
