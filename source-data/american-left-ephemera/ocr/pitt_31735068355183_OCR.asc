THE MINE’-MILL umon

¥YOUB Voice
IS loud!

s — E YNDON B. JOHNSON of Texas beams confidence as he cam-
 paigns for the presidency of the United States. He expects
 to win, and he wants to win BIG.
, - But while the presidential race might possibly (repeat, might,
0‘ ‘repeat, possibly) be a landslide, many battles for Congressional
9 seats and for the Senate, not to mention many of the raft of impor-
 tant state and local offices that are up for grabs, are expected to
 be nip and tuck affairs. Although many people still don’t believe
' ' it, one vote——your vote—counts.
As in horse-racing, world series competition, and Army-Navy
games, in elections there’s no such thing as a sure thing. Ad-
 , mittedly, the computers have killed the excitement of an evening
‘ . ‘D ofelection returns, but even Univac doesn’t go to work until the
0 polls have closed. While newspaper headlines may never again
«herald the wrong winner, as they did in 1948, upsets will continue

_ to occur.

ISTORY is full of major decisions that could easily have gone

if the other way. Texas, the home state of one of today’s major
candidates, was admitted to the union in 1845. The vote in the U.S.

  
   

 

 

Senate: 26 to 26, before Senator Hannegan of Indiana changed his

mind and voted in favor. Hannegan had been elected to Congress
 by one single vote.
In Germany on Nov. 8, 1923, members of the tiny Nazi party
met in a beer hall and elected a leader. The choice was by one
;vote. The leader’s name was Adolf Hitler.

3 . German rather than English, incidentally, might well have
F f been the main language spoken in this country. During the Revo-
'1 lutionary War, with anti—British sentiment running high, a bill was
introduced in Congress to abolish English as the official language
and adopt German. The bill was defeated—by one vote. v
' There are other squeakers. Charles I of England literally lost
 his head in 1649 when a tribunal of judges voted 68 to 67 to have
, him executed. France became a republic rather than a monarchy
 in 1875 by a 353 to 352 vote of the deputies.

 RESIDENT ANDREW JOHNSON came close to being im-
peached in 1868. The vote difference in the Senate was one

vote. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes was elected President by 185_

to 184 electoral votes. V

Marcus Morton, campaigning for governor of Massachusetts
back in 1839, needed a vote total of 51,034 to put him across, and
that’s exactly what he got.

, Only four years ago, while we didn’t view quite that much of

avcliffhanger, John F. Kennedy was elected President by a margin

1 of less than one-tenth of one percent of the total votes cast over

_, E Richard M. Nixon. That’s a majority of less than one vote per
precinct across the country.

The vote you cast on Nov. 3 may not be in a race that’s decided
by a single vote. But, remember, it’s as BIG as that cast by
anyone else. And it doesn't take too many Election Day stay-at-
homes, IN ANY ELECTION, to turn the tide against the candidate
that, in their hearts, they support.

THE MINE-MlIi.L UNION

STRIEZ HEADQUARTERS for members of Mine-Mill Local .735 in C-leveland, Ohio, who

 closed down the Federal Metal Company for 39 days before winning a contract which
provides an average wage increase of 121/2 cents per hour the first year and many
other gains, L. to R: Ike Pebbles, Willie Sunter, and Edward House (in front).'

I , Workers Ratify First M-M  
’:.Contmct With Federal Metal

BEDFORD, Ohio--A 39-day strike against the Federal Metal Company was suc-

cessfully concluded on Oct. 5, when some 50 employees achieved their first contract ‘

under Mine-Mill. The workers, members of the Cleveland Amalgamated Local, No.
735, won a model contract which provides a union shop with checkoff, pay for time
lost in processing grievances or negotiating with the company, job bidding and plant-
wide seniority, and the right to refuse work on any job deemed unsafe by the union

without penalty.

In addition, the new three-year contract provides wage increases in the first year
ranging from 5 cents to 42 cents per hour, with an average hike of 121/2 cents per

hour. _

_ For the first time, employees will be paid time and a half for work over 8 hours
in a day at the plant which normally operates on a basis

lasting 91/2 hours. They also won
time and a half pay for Satur-
'day work as such, double time
pay for Sunday work as such,
and two and a half times pay
for holidays worked.

April Election

. _ The small shop was organized
only a few years ago. An AFL-
CIO union, which failed to con-
duct educational work in I the
plant or to assist in the proc-
essing of grievances or, for that

.matter, to fight for the rein-

’ statement of several leaders who
had been fired after an unauth-
orized strike a year and a half
ago, was replaced by Mine-Mill
in an NLRB election in April.
Mine-Mill received 46 votes to
none for the previous bargaining
agent,

The first year of the new con-
tract also provides weekly sick-
ness and accident benefits of
$40, Blue Cross-Blue Shield cov-
erage one half paid for by the

- _, company, and work gloves for
"  certain groups of workers.

In the agreement’s second
year, the employees will re-

-ceive three days funeral leave
.with pay in the event of a death

"in the immediate family, $2,500

 fin‘ life insurance coverage, an
 additional paid holiday, making
4w a total of seven, and a 3 cents
T.-“fzper hour across-the-board wage
 increase.

The third year provides a gen-
eral wage hike of 5 cents" per

_ V ‘hour, plus an additional 5 cents
-  per hour for laborers.

 Each employee was granted
$50 in back pay when the strike
i was settled.

Smith, 29, who is survived by

achieve a contract containing
adequate health and safety pro-
visions.

A tire on the company’s truck
blew out on the Ohio Turnpike
on July 14, and Smith was
crushed when the tractor-trailer
rig overturned.

Over 30 bargaining sessions
were held, with the Federal

if Mediation and Conciliation Ser-

vice being involved in the last
six. Willie Walker headed the
union’s negotiating committee,
which also included Daniel
Small, Edward House, and John
Henderson, and was assisted
by Board Member Raymond
Dennis. Kenneth Morfitt was a
federal mediator.

MIAMI, Ariz.—Outstanding health and welfare gains,‘ 
for employees, dependents, and pensioners, coupled witlr‘
the Mine-M111-established industrywide pattern in the
areas of wages and job security, produced early this’
month for the Miami Miners Union and eight craft and}
railroad locals an impressive new three-year contract
the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company.  ;

Wage increases in the agreement, reached on Oct: 
range from 17 1/2 cents to 32 cents per hour over the three ,
years, with an average boost of 24 cents an hour. Addition?’ .5 T"

 

allbf. job grade 1 is eliminated and job reclassifications,~'~§;.
which like this year’s wage hikes are retroactive to July 
1, affect about 45 percent of the Mine-Millwork force.

of the International Association
of Machinists.

Increased s h i f t differentials
and improved vacations are al-
so included in the settlement.

Effective Nov. 1, all past and
future retirees and their wives
will be covered by a health plan
which will pay most of their
outpatient, hospital, m e die a l,
and surgical costs in the com-
pany hospital. The care will be
provided at the very low cost of
$2.50 daily for hospital charges
and $1.50 for doctor visits. The
plan will be funded by a $1.21
company donation per month
per active employee. After 120
days of hospitalization, retirees
and their "wives will have to pay
more, but still will get reduced

rates.
Other Gains

All charges for employees and
dependents at company facili-
ties will be eliminated on July 1,
1965, including charges for drugs,
x-rays, and laboratory work.
Also next year, a $10,000 major
medical plan for dependents will
go into effect, with 80 percent of
the cost being paid by the com-
pany. Dependents’ hospital con-
finement, without charge, will
be increased from 31 to 60 days.

THE MINE-MILL -UNION

V -..—...- -V.-‘-.-—«_.—.—¢a--I--~-_i_,'

2-». -vIrf";‘3" ,-

_ . CHICAGO, Ill.—--Seventy-three delegatesrepresenting 11 Mine-Mill locals in
‘-seven states attended a two-day District 4 conference at the Midland Hotel here this

month, and organized to get out a maximum vote on Nov. 3.
The meeting, chaired by Board Member Raymond Dennis, endorsed the Johnson-
Humphrey ticket, reaffirming the position of the international executive board on

the 1964 election.

The group also agreed that the executive boards and steward bodies of the vari-
ous local uni-ons would function as campaign _committees for the next month—-work-

C . ing to get members,. their families, and other people in their commu'nities to the polls,

and, in addition, to help raise funds through voluntary donations by the workers, so-

cial affairs, ‘and in other ways.

All locals. reported active participation and good results in registration drives

which had preceded the con-

ference.

Mrs. Esther Saperstein, a

, Democratic state legislator from

Chicago, addressed the meet-
ing, pointing to the human con-
cern of the Johnson administra-

- tion -as exemplified by the Anti-

Poverty Act and the medicare
bill. A supporter of improved
care and training for the men-
tally retarded, Mrs. Saperstein
has introduced and worked for‘
legislation in that area. She
maintained that Illinois now has

‘ the most advanced program for

the mentally retarded in the
country.‘ - A

Statement on Election

, The -lengthy resolution on the
national election- adopted at the
Oct. 10 and 11 conference says
that the “forces who have seized
control of much of the Repub-
lican party are tied up with the
most reactionary anti-labor cor-
porations, who seek cheap labor
through their runaway shops at
home and abroad.” Stating that
the Goldwater movement. has in-
spired and strengthened the ra-
cial bigots and-anti-Semites, the
resolution maintains that “this
new situation imposes upon the
labor movement the challenging
new "task of building a coalition
of the working people, the’ great
civil rights movement, and all
those who have a stake in our
democratic way of life and who
wish‘ to preserve peace in the

A world. ”'

Other resolutions adopted at
the meeting cited the need for
a shorter work week as a means
of combatting unemployment
and called for action at the 1965
Mine-Mill convention to accel-
erate the building of a $1 mil-
lion international strike fund.

Israel Williams, Jr., of Local
531 in Bessemer, Ala., a mem-
ber of the Bessemer Voters
League, explained the difficulty
of voting in that state, saying

is . .that..schools and group meetings

were set up to educate potential
voters before they attempted to
register. Intimidation also cuts
down on citizen participation in

of service. In addition, the new contract provides for op-
tional retirement at age 60 and retirement atage 55 with
company permission. While the old plan reduced the nor-

retirement between age 55 and
65, the new agreement calls for
a reduction of only 3 percent per
year. In other words, an em-
ployee who retires 10 years
early will still receive 70 per-
cent of the regular pension pay-
ments.

Weekly sickness and accident-

benefits have been increased to
75 percent ‘ of an employee’s

- earnings, to a maximum of $80.

In the area of job security,
any worker laid off because of
technological changes or plant
shutdown will receive $80 times

vice.

Struggle at Britanno Beach Continues

BRITANNIA BEACH, B. C.—The 12-week-old strike by 350 workers, members of Mine-Mill“‘663, against the
Anaconda Company has been increasingly marked by company. threats and provocations in recent weeks. In the

face of several Anaconda maneuvers, the employees rejected by 88 percent on a referen

proposal and beefed up their picket lines.

1 Although Anaconda has been threatening to shut the p

dum vote the latest company

roperty down since negotiations began back in   C 
has added attempts to promote scabbing, to break the. pick et line, andrto go over the heads of the.unio’n’s- negotiating  ’- 2‘

committee to the workers in an attempt to get them to accept -an inferior contract. The company-also.sought,-but failed

' to get, an injunction to prevent picketing and to force the linen and their families out oftheir company-owned homes. 
Negotiations, in which the B. C.. Labor Department has become involved, are broken ‘down -..over..the union’s.de-~.

mands forjob reclassifications and either a guaranteed Monday to Friday work week or-premium pay for Saturday

and Sunday work for those
whose days off would be stag-
gered.

Scclbbing glnvited

Before the referendum vote

' was taken, Anaconda announced

that it had withdrawn its offer
and that the mine was being
closed down. A few workers who
had been doing maintenance
work, in accordance with ar-
rangements made prior to the
strike, were given termination
slips on Sept. 25. They were told,
however, that if they would
come to the company office the
following Monday, they would
be hired as new employees at
the new rates proposed by the
company——an open invitation to
scab their own strike.

Efforts to get trucks loaded
with scrap through the picket
lines have also failed, with the

- I-workers and the many ..women
on the line — showing real. deter- -

mination in turning them back.
Union counsel W. J. Wallace,

in speaking against the injunc-

tion proceeding, argued that
the Labor Act permitted persu-
asive picketing at the employer’s
place of business and said_ that
if the company could move
pickets off their property, all
workers in company towns
would become second class citi-
zens. Mr. Justice Verchere, who
heard the ‘case, agreed with
his presentation and commented
on it in his order denying the
injunction.__ -
Price Hikes
On Sept. 22, when Anaconda

-made‘ its “final” offer, govern-

ment officials taking part in the
discussions asked the company
officials if Anaconda were going

The demands of Local 663
total a significantly lesser

The company now says. that
the property is closed down.
The workers, who closed it with
their strike, are maintaining
picket lines while waiting to see
if equipment begins to be re-
moved from the mine.

Mining jobs, union officials
maintain, are available in near-
by communities. They have been
saying since February, that
threats of shutdown will not

A Successful Bargaining in 1964

by Al Skinner
- ' lnternational President

OR THE PAST 10 MONTHS the major effort of our union has

L been the preparation for and negotiation of 1964 contracts
through-out the industry. Beginning with the National Wage Policy
Conference in Tucson, Arizona, last January, wherebargaining de-
m_ands were drafted and the National Wage Policy Committee

, elected, our local unions, our bargaining councils, and the inter-
national union have concentrated on this important job. In the

leader of the union was involved, including our research and
publicity staff. ’

- On the road to the bargaining table it became necessary to root
out disruption, division, and attempted raids by Steel and to de-

 
 

‘~ contract negotiations with many of the major companies.
5' A united and determined union did this job——and did it well—and
then went to the bragaining table and negotiated contract settle-
a C ments that stack up with the best in Ameri- ' "‘
can industry this year. It is an achievement
v of which every member of this union can be
proud. It is an achievement which brings
, greater benefits and security to our mem-
bers and their families. It has proved be-
, yond any doubt that Mine-Mill is the only
* ‘ ,  union that can negotiate and establish a
 - substantial national pattern in the non-fer-
'. rous mining, smelting, and fabricating in-
. .dustry. In saying this, We are not overlook-

-, ing the contributions and cooperation of Skinner
‘scores of locals in craft and railroad unions. We respect and ap-
preciate this unity as an important part of the bargaining effort.

. ‘ _ What Was Achieved?

OB SECURITY-—Our determination to establish a substantial
breakthrough in the area of job security was, with few excep-
tions, very successful. Negotiation, for the first time in this indus-
_ try, of security-severance plans established the principle that com-
panies from now on must recognize their responsibility for the job
.. security of their employees. Our union intends to continue this

    

' all members of this union.

Wages—Under all major three-year contracts signed, wages
were increased ‘from 21c to 34c per hour, including job reclassi-
fications. ,

Vacation Plans—-Substantial extension of vacation time and
tbenefitsywere negotiated in all contracts this year.

A Health and Welfare—Almost, every contract negotiated this
year provided either for elimination or very substantial reduction
of employee premiums. In addition, improvement and extension of
, benefits were negotiated in hospital and medical plans, weekly
 .- sick and accident benefits, life insurance, and coverage for pen-
sioners.
2 ' Shift Differentials—Very substantial increases in premium pay
_-for shift workers was provided in most contract settlements
~ ..-{throughout the union. » —
M Other Contract Benefits-—Many other improvements and bene-
fits for our members were written into many 1964 contracts. They
1 include jury dutypay, three days funeral leave with pay, premium
-pay -for Sunday work, vesting of sick leave, guarantees against
layoff due to automation, improved safety and health standards,
-‘union safety committees, and a host of local union contract im-

'Pr°Y°mentS- The Value of the Package
UR UNION was far more interested in the content of the settle-

  

 

 

" _ ments than we were in inﬂated cost figures or claims as to

‘_ the’tota1 cost of the package. We have engaged in this game be-
fore with many companies. ,We set out to achieve specific benefits
_and contract improvements regardless of cost figures, and,‘ to a

’ considerable extent, we achieved those objectives. We negotiated
solid and substantial gains in wages, health and welfare, security,
.and fringe benefits.

’ ~ ‘ Our conservative estimate is that the total value of all settle-
gments with the major companies fell between 35c and 40c per hour

, for three-year contracts. This includes AS&R,. Kennecott, Ana-
conda,-Phelps Dodge, Magma Copper, American Metals, Inspira-
tion Consolidated,’ and American Zinc. Settlements with scores of
smaller companies equalled or came close to these settlement pat-
’terns. " . . ‘ , ’

_.  To the thousands engaged in this bargainingiefforts, including

local leaders, department stewards, negotiating committees, bar-
aiming", councils, staff representatives, and office employees, the
t "national executive board says thanks for a: job well done. Our

Humboldt, Ariz. Miners Ratify
  ontract UnderMne-MiIl ;.

HUMBOLDT, Ariz.-—Elimination of a sliding Wage scale which depended on the 
prices of metals featured a new three-year contract negotiated last month at the Iron ;
King mine, which had been represented by the United Steelworkers of America until, 1., 3
March 25 when Mine-Mill won an NLRB election. . 2 "

The maximum premium of 8 cents per hour which workers had received only while ‘ , A 

First

 

  
  

 

 

prices were up was permanently incorporated into the wage rates, so that dips in prices ’ C 

will no longer affect the employees. In addition, workers received an iacross-the-board; 
wage increase of 4 cents an hour for the first year of the contract, retroactive to 1 

  

Aug. 1, and hikes of 6 cents per hour, effective Aug. 1, 1965, and Aug. 1, 1966. ,  " 

Many job reclassifications, effective immediately, cost the Shattuck-Denn Mining 
Company an estimated 33/; cents per hour. A " V

Health and welfare gains include an increase in the amount of coverage for hos-, 5“

pital room and board and diag-
nostic x-ray and laboratory
tests.

In the second year of the con-
tract, employees will receive an
additional holiday—the day be-
fore Christmas—and iii the third
year, increased shift differen-
tials.

Sept. 27 Meeting

The agreement, which covers
some 225. employees, was over-

whelmingly ratified by the
workers on-Sept. 27.
Another important advance

was made in the area of safety,
with the establishment of two
safety inspection ~committees
which will make monthly tours
of their respective departments
and file written reports and rec-
ommendations on their findings.

One of the many complaints
against the Steelworkers during
the six years that that union
represented the property was
the failure tohelp eliminate the
numerous safety hazards at the
mine.

The sliding wage scale had
operated so that no premium
was given to the employees if
the price of zinc was under 12
cents per pound. Workers re-
ceived an extra 2 cents per
hour when the price hit 12 cents,
and-for every one-half cent rise
in the price above that, up
to a maximum premium of ’8
cents per hour when the price
was at 131/2 cents per pound or
higher.

Although zinc has remained
steady_at 131/2 cents since‘ April,
it has fluctuated a good deal
over the past few years. It was
selling at 11 cents back in 1959,

 

and, as recently as from Jan.
10 to Dec. 1, 1961, when the go-
ing price was 111/2 cents per
pound, workers were receiving
no premium at all.

Oppose Sliding Scale

The sliding scale, which Mine-
Mill has always resisted, was
inserted in the contract by the
Steelworkers, but has proved un-
popular with the workers.

Mine-Mill became bargaining
agent at the underground Hum-
boldt mine in March, winning an
NLRB election by a 97 to 85 vote.

had been accepted only after
the union had threatened to end

Democratic Slate All the Way  
tah’s Joint    ttee

 

_ MAGNA, Utah——The Utah Mine-Mill political action committee met here Oct. 2 to
map strategy for the campaign to help elect candidates endorsed by five local unions
in the state—in each case, the entire Democratic ticket for county, state, and federal

offices.

‘Voter registration, which, unlike most states, does not close in Utah until Oct. 28,
was to be a prime target for the next few weeks. The committee agreed to distribute
widely leaflets providing information on who is eligible to vote, where and when peo-

I -ple can register, how to transfer a registration from one district to another.

On the state and national levels, the Utah Niine-Mill locals called for the election
of Calvin L. Rampton as governor, the Johnson-Humphrey ticket, U.S. Sen. Frank E.

~_Moss, and David S. King and

William Burin, Democrats run-
ning for Congress from the
state’s Second and First Dis-

5 tricts respectively.

King, Rampton, and Allan
Howe, last year’s president of
the Young Democratic Clubs of
America,who is Moss’ chief ad-
ministrative assistant, addressed
a special political action meet-

‘ing at the Local 392 hall on

Oct. 1, attended by members of
the .various Mine-Mill locals and
their wives.

, Captains Picked

, On Oct. 8, executive board
members, shop stewards, and
political action committee mem-
bers of all five locals, who will
coordinate the political activi-
ties for the duration of the cam-
paign, met and named captains
who will -work each district
where Mine-Mill has a concen-
tration of membership. Com-
.mittees were chosen to assist
candidates campaigning at the
plant gates and to pass out cam-
paign literature, which will also
go out through the shop steward
system.

Another open meeting on Oct.
20 featured the showing of a
film called “Extremists.” A
- International Representative
G. L. (Penny) Buckner is chair-
man of the Utah joint political
action committee, which in-
volves Local 392 in Magna, Lo-

cal 485 in Bingham Canyon,-

Local 692 in Salt Lake City,
Local 55 in Tooele, and Local
876' in Saltair.
Rampton vs. Melich

Rampton, who two years ago
lost to King in a primary race
for the Senate seat now held
by Wallace F. Bennett, has
called for the abolition of “right-
to-work” laws in the state, for
a revamping ofithe state Indus-
trial Commission, and for a pro-

“gram which will bring non-mili-

tary, industries to Utah. ’His
opponent, Republican Mitchell

-Melich from Moab, is ,b,a,cked__

by the mining and oil industries

and is .a strong Goldwater sup- ‘

porter.

Moss also faces an ultra-con-
servative opponent in Dr. Ernest
L. ‘Wilkinson, past president of
Brigham Young University-. ' -A

, co-sponsor of the Metcalf-Mon-y
-toya mine safety bill, Moss is

chairman ofthe Senate Interior

, Subcommittee on Irrigation and '

Reclamation. Winning his Sen-
ate seat when an independent
candidate split_ the Republican
vote six years ago, Moss ap-
pears in better shape today, ‘al-
though he is in no sense a shoo-in.

Most of the Mine-Mill mem-
bers in Utah reside in the Sec-

STRIKING MEMBERS OF LOCAL 632 in Indianapolis, Indiana, have maintained their picket lines on a 24-hour per day, seven days a week basisisince
Sept. 24. The National Lead Company's latest offer was rejected as inadequate, and morale remains high, according to lesse Van Camp (far left)_,’[ -_
 international representative on the scene. The National Lead plant, a secondary smelter, had been closed down by the state Department of Health»7
only a few months ago because of the conditions which presented a health hazard to the employees. A  s  ’

 National Lead Co. Strike
  Moves Toward 6th Week

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.—Worker morale is high as the strike by
Local 632 against the National Lead Company’s secondary smelter
here heads towards its sixth week. Two meetings with the company
since the shutdown, the last one on Oct. 14, has produced an offer
for a three—year contract which the employees still consider as
inferior. ‘

[The local, which has 51 members, struck the plant on Sept. 24,
determined to achieve a settlement in line with other non-ferrous
metals contracts throughout the country.

A strike vote had registered 96 percent in favor, the interna-
tional union had given strike sanction, and, when a final offer of
15 cents spread over two years
was rejected, the smelter was
closed down. B

The picket line has been main-
tained around the clock seven
days a week, with the workers
divided into three groups, each
of which takes an eight—hour
shift per day. A closed truck and
a bus, donated by Joe Chaney
and Rev. John Cross respective-
ly, both members of the Mine-
Mill local, are located at the
plant entrance and provide shel-
ter for the picketers. A strike
headquarters has been estab-
lished at the home of another
member, Willie Norman, who
lives next to the plant. '

Although the number of work-
ers is rather small, their de-
pendents total 240. The strike
committee is working with the
county and federal food surplus
offices to obtain food supplies.

 Eight meetings with the com-

 

pany Were‘ held prior to the be-
ginning of the strike, with the
Federal Mediation and Concilia-
tion Service assisting in five.

Over 800 people attended the meetin g at the Penjamo Club in North Hurley, to

- hear Montoya stress the importance of supporting candidates dedicated to the wel-
 ~ ‘fare of all segments of the American people, including the working man and his family.
- ‘Pointing to his opponent’s “No, no, no policy” in Washington, he said that Mechem’s

, Local 890 also is backing
Democratic Governor Jack

and ‘Thomas Morris, another
Democrat, who now holds the
other Congressional seat in the
state.

7 Most Crucial Election
International Secretary-Treas-
urer Irving Dichter strongly
urged the membership to work
and vote for the Johnson-

i Humphrey ticket, as well as for
.Montoya and other candidates,

calling the 1964 election “the
most crucial of the 20th cen-
tury.” “The American people,”
said Dichter, “and particularly
the working people, cannot af-

 ford to place their future in the ,
 hands of Goldwater and the ex-
* 3 Vktreme right wing.’,’

was appointed to the Senate in
1962 to fill out the term of the
late Senator Dennis Chavis. He
was one of 19 Senators who op-
posed the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty; one of 21 to vote against
the tax cut; and one-of six Re-
publicans to oppose cloture in

the civil rights debate. He
missed 64 roll call votes on

sent for 166 of the 176 quorum
calls during the debate on civil
rights.

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Th_e National Labor Relations_Board ruled on Sept. 30 that a 61/2-year strike against
the Kohler Company by the United Auto Workers resulted from unfair labor practices on the part of the company,
and ordered the reinstatement of 57 Workers. _

The Board, by a  to 1 vote, saidpthat the company “at no time intended to accept the union as -the collective
bargaining representative to be dealt, with in good faith, but, on the contrary, had a firm and fixed intention to under-

-mine, weaken, and eventually destroy the collective bargaining relationship.”

The company, which has failed to reinstate other workers and pay them for lost wages in compliance with a
1962 court decree enforcing anearlier decision by the NLRB, has vowed to appeal the recent decision to the Supreme

Court.

, ‘Thus, the Kohler case, one of the longest ever litigated before the Board, promises to drag on further. It con-
cerns a strike by Local 833 of the UAW which beganin 1954. i
The NLRB had ruled in 1960 that the strike—a bitter struggle which was marred by violence——was an economic

dispute to begin with, but that
Kohler was guilty of an unfair
labor practice when the com-
pany increased the wages of
nonstrikers. In that ruling, which
has not been carried out and
concerning which the Board has
now filed a civil contempt pro-
ceeding against Kohler, the com-

pany was ordered to reinstate
all strikers who wished to return
to work with the exception of a
group of 77.

The recent ruling says that at
no time was the strike an eco-

nomic dispute, that it was’

caused by unfair labor practices

from its start. The Board has
now ordered the reinstatement

of 57 workers with back pay for"

wages lostvfrom the Jan. 26, 1962
decision of the appeals court to
the date when the company
makes its offer to put them back
on the job, plus interest. Three
of the 77 strikers have died dur-
ing the course of the proceed-
ings, and the Board rejected re-

instatement for 17 strikers who,-

it says, physically and violently
assaulted nonstrikers or threat-
ened members of nonstrikers’
families.

Voluminous Record

The written r e c o r d in the
Kohler case includes 20,408 pages

\of testimony and some 1,900 ex- .

’hibits—a stack of evidence 16
feet high.

The recent majority opinion is
signed by Chairman Frank W.
McCu1loch, Gerald A. Brown,
and Howard Jenkins, Jr., all of
whom became members of the
Board after the earlier decision
in 1960. John H. Fanning wrote
a concurring opinion, while Boyd
Leedom dissented in part.

What else did the Board have
to say about the Wisconsin
plumbingware manufacturer?
Here are some other quotes from
the majority opinion: ‘

,Kohler’s prestrike provoca-
tions created a “climate of
desperation and. fear "among

L , its employees which produced

the mass picketing." ‘

The employer’s unlawful dis-
charges,itr-ansfers, threats, so-
licitations, evictions, espion-
age, -information :-refusals -“in-.

”  ‘. ,-   -,,'.:-,-¥,.'1kl;,4,-’ V  ~ -*  "ti-3"--V

duced the home demonstra-
tions and the employment of-
fice picketing.”

Kohler made strike prepara-
tions which included the pur-
chase of shotguns, tear gas
guns, ammunition and food
supplies, construction of watch-
towers, and stockpiling of coal.

A Kohler vice-president said
that the contract relationship
was “a shotgun wedding.”

The company had fought or-
ganizational efforts by any’ out-

‘side union for 20 ‘years "with an ~
unremitting union animus (ha-j =

tred), and even when it did
enter. into a contract with the
UAW in 1953, Kohler admin-
istered the contract in such a
way as to deny its employees
the benefits they had negoti-
ated. , ,

Since the Board originally di-
rected Kohler to bargain with
the local, the company and,un-
ion have twice negotiated labor
contracts, the latest one being a
one-year agreement signed last
November. It provided some 2,-
800 employees a wages and bene-
fits package averaging about
111/2 cents an hour.

The Board decision of Sept. 30
is another battle lost in the long
war the Kohler Company has
been waging against the UAW
and unionism. The Kohler Com-
pany is going to discover, one of
these days, that the 20th century
is upon us. -

The ruling, according to UAW
Secretary-Treasurer Emil Maz-
ey, is hoped to ‘‘clear the -air
and result in better relation

.with the company.’.’_ - . , ..

Selected each year by a committee of the Norwegian Parliament under the terms of the will of the late Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
inventor of dynamite, the peace prize winner receives $54,600. Dr. King has pledged that the entire amount “will go to the civil rights
movement to further the work in the philosophy of non-violence.” T '
“Deeply moved and gratified and honored,” by the choice, Dr. King said that the award was a tribute to all who had marched in
the crusade against intolerance and inequality.”

The following is an excerpt from
Dr. King’s now-famous “Letter
from Birmingham City J ail”:

“ . I am here, along with
several members of my staff,
because we were invited here.
I am here because I have basic
organizational ties here. Beyond
this, I am in Birmingham be-
cause injustice is here. Just as

their ‘thus saith the Lord’ far

tically every hamlet and city of
the Graeco-Roman world, I too
am compelled to carry the gos-
pel of freedom beyond by par-
ticular home town. Like Paul, I
must constantly respond to the
Macedonian call for aid.”

Move to Political Arena
Dr. King, who has insisted that

N the nonviolent leaders of the in-

tegration movement could lose
control if its progress is too
slow, looks back on 1963 and
calls Birmingham the “spark-
plug” that placed the racial

I Fast-Moving Action in copper

7 Copper markets continued to churn following the action of U.S.
producers September 21 in raising the U.S. price of copper by
2’_f{cents to '34 cents per pound. Following pressure from the Chilean
government, Anaconda and Kennecott on October 6 raised the
price}, of Chilean copper sold in Europe by 21/2, cents a pound’ to
35 cents. U.S. copper produced by Kennecott and Anaconda and‘
sold in Europe remained at 32% cents, as “did copper sold by
African producers. Brass and wire mills in the U.S. and abroad
in-ained unable to meet their needs for copper from producers,
and were forced to purchase from dealers, the New York Com-
ymodity.-Exchange, and onthe London Metal Exchange.

.~‘.._?.New York metal dealers and traders on the two exchanges
hayet been closing deals at between 50 cents and over 60 cents a
pound in- recent weeks. Producers are concerned about these
extremely high prices, fearing ‘that users of copper may turn to
less ‘ expensive substitutes.

_;"In response to these concerns, Senator Mike Mansfield (D.,
Mont.) proposed on October 13 that the U.S. government release
50,000 tons of copper from U.S. stockpiles to alleviate the tight
’ supply. situation. The U.S. government now has legal authority to
sell‘ nearly 100,000 tons of copper, but the Office of Emergency
Planning says the total U.S. stocks of over one million tons may
be, short of emergency stockpile requirements. At Mine-Mill Union
press time, no action. on Senator Mansfield’s proposal had been
announced. ‘ ‘

‘Oopper Squeeze Hitting independent I

j"=iCopper shortages were further highlighted recently by
announcement by Anaconda and Phelps Dodge that deliveries of
copper would be cut by 25 percent. The Anaconda action was
' prompted by a continued slowdown by workers at its big copper
_jIn_ine and smelter at Chuquicamata, Chile, which started August 25-.
The slowdown was in protest over payments under the company’s
I ".b_oiius payment plan. Phelps Dodge said merely that its inventories
had» been worked down by heavy buying in September and October
and) that it had not been determined how much copper would be
ave‘ able for delivery in November.

copper mine near Kingman, Arizona, has completed exploratory
drilling on a copper prospect near Battle Mountain, Nevada. Duval
holds claims to the property under lease from American Smelting
and Refining Company. If evaluation of the results is favorable,
Duval will operate an open pit mine and ship concentrates to a

custom smelter.

Lead and Zinc Supplies Tight

The House of Representatives on the last day of the 88th Con-
gress passed a bill to release an additional 50,000 tons of zinc from
the national stockpile, but the bill got lost in the hectic closing
hours of the Senate session. Congress earlier had passed a bill
releasing’ 75,000 tons of zinc and 50,000 tons of lead from the
national stockpile. Both moves reflect the very tight supplies. of
lead and especially zinc. Use of zinc in automotive die castings
and in galvanizing has increased substantially in the past year.

HUMBOLDT, Ariz. -— A day-
long picnic at the Thumb Butte '
picnic grounds was held on Sun-
day, Oct. 18, sponsored by the
Yavapai Mine-Mill Union, Lo’-
cal 942, to celebrate the new
contract covering Iron King
Workers.

of Spanish-speaking Arizonans-,

lead and Zinc Each Rise One Cent Per Pound  

Lead and zinc prices were ad-
vanced by U.S. producers in
mid-October by one cent per
pound. The new prices are lead,
15 cents and zinc, 141/2 cents.
This is the highest U.S. price
for lead since 1957, and the high-
est price for zinc since 1952.

In the case of both metals,‘

producers said the increases
were posted in order to enable

U.S. smelters to bid competi-
tively for concentrates imported
from abroad. Prices in Europe
have risen to levels that have
enabled European smelters to
outbid U.S. smelters in recent
months. For the first time in
years, US. scrap dealers have
been exporting lead scrap to Eu-
rope and Japan in preference to

-selling at lower prices for scrap

. prevailing in the U.S.

The recent price boosts will
further increase already swollen
profits being enjoyed by U.S.
lead-zinc producers. Integrated
companies, producing from mine \
through smelter or refinery, will
reap additional profits before

taxes of $20 per ton of metal

produced for every one cent in-
crease in the price.

The U. S. Bureau of Mines inspected the Gimlet and Luke phosphate mines of the Montana
Phosphate Company near Avon, Powell County, Montana in September. The reports include the re-
sults of air sampling for noxious gases, which’ were well below harmful levels at the times and

places of sampling.

1 Two miners were reported as having been injured last July by an explosion caused by drilling

into a missed hole. Oneﬂman was offthe job for 11 da
was still off the job August 31 after 46 days lost.

Improvements noted and rec-

, ommendations were as follows;

OThe vent" tubing in 5129
stope was freed of broken rock

which obstructed the passage of

air.

0 The ~transform_ers

side of the shaft station at the
5300 level should be installed on‘

,fire-resistant material. (Repeat-

ed from previous inspection re-

port in March). _
 O Miners should extend the
vent tubing into the stopes and.

within 30 feet of the face to in-
sure adequate ventilation. (Re-

peated from previous inspection-

report in March.)

, Z O The recently. installed com-‘

pressor in the compressor build-

ihg should have its air intake

extended outside the building.

inorganic compounds have been
known with varying degrees of
understanding and In is u n d e r-
standing for centuries. This situ-
ation persists, for the growth of
new knowledge has been associ-
ated with a tremendous lag in
its dissemination, and with a
still greater delay in its applica-
tion in clinical medicine and in-
dustrial hygiene.

“. . .' It is cause for much. . .
surprise and indeed, for great
concern, that in a country in
which technical knowledge and
skill have reached a very high
point——in which research and de-
velopment in industry have be-
come magic words and deeds in
our p r o du c tiv e, competitive
economy — we should find so
great a lag and such striking in-
eptitude in the application of the

available technical knowledge in .

providing conditions in which the
uniquely useful physical and

— chemical properties of metallic

lead and its compounds can be
utilized to the full, Lwithout ex-
acting an unduly . high toll in
sickness and disability from the
men and women who work with
these materials. _

“. . . something new and de-
cisive has been added to our
knowledge in recent years with
the amassing of overwhelming
evidence that, when the rate of

the absorption of lead by men
is kept within certain well-de-
fined limits, no intoxication oc-
curs. It is this fact which sets
the standard of industrial medi-

~ cine and hygiene which is to be

achieved in the lead-using in-
dustries.

“. . . The means by which
dangerous occupational exposure
to lead may be. differentiated
from that which is harmless are
now available and have been put
to the practical test of time and
use.

“Methods, a derived essentially
from engineering techniques, are
also available whereby occupa-
tional exposure to lead canbe
brought to and maintained with-

in the limits of safety. These

have proved their adequacy in
use and. are suited to general
application. .

“The combined modern arma-
mentarium of industrial medicine
and hygiene can be so applied

as to eliminate. lead. poisoning:

from American industry ‘when
the determination to do. so has
become a -general policy of in-
dustrial managemen .” a
