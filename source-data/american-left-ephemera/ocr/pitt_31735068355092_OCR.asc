aead Man ‘Testifies’
In Conspiracy Case

- DENVER—A dead man has “testified” for the government in
the retrial of seven Mine-Mill leaders on Taft-Hartley “conspiracy”

charges here. -

Federal District Court Judge Alfred A. Arraj ruled that the
1959 testimony of former Board Member Bill Mason, who died
last year in an auto accident, could be re-enacted for the jury by

government lawyers.
The government is seeking

_ , complied with the non-Commu-

nist affidavit provision of the
Taft-Hartley Act without in fact
severing their connections with
the Communist Party, and that
for thatlpurpose they engaged
-in a “conspiracy” to defraud the
government.

Mason’s testimony was ad-

.. Initted under a 19th Century Su-
Apreme Court ruling permitting

suchpractices, and over the ve-
hement objections of counsel for
the defense. ‘

The only new witness sched-
uled for the prosecution is Alton
Lawrence, a former Board
Member who was one of the
original 14 defendants in the
-case in 1959. He resigned from
the Board at that "time and
pleaded nolo contendere (no con-
-test), indicating that he would
accept whatever verdict was
given the other defendants but
that he did not himself wish to

‘ stand trial.

 

Other witnesses, who also ap-
peared at the 1959 trial, were
Ralph Locke, former interna-
tional representative; James
Peterson, former staff member
and now Director of Industrial
Relations, Utah Division, Ken-
necott Copper Corp.; and Ed-
ward Bush, former officer of

Local 18, Kellogg, .Idaho. Also

scheduled to appear, in addition
to Lawrence, are Bobby G.
Fikes, Arthur Moralez, and Fred
.Gardner.

Defendants in the case are Al-
bert C. Skinner, president; Irv-
ing, Dichter, secretary-treasur-
er; Raymond Dennis, District 4
Board Member; Charles Wilson
and Jesse Van Camp, interna-
tional representatives; Harold

MocIbBIast Shows Need

For Federal Mine Safety Law

The methane gas explosion which claimed 18 lives at the potash mine under de-
velopment for Texas Gulf Sulfur Company near Moab, Utah once againhighlights the
deplorable inadequacy of state mine safety programs and the need for federal inspec-
tion and enforcement of safety rules and standards.

The safety record at this mine prior to the explosion was particularly bad. Four
men met accidental deaths prior to the explosion August 27. Less than a month be-

fore the disaster, a methane gas explosion underground burned four men, two severely. »

This accident was never reported to the U. S. Bureau of Mines and Bureau officials

first learned of it when they arrived at the -scene of the disaster. Nevertheless, Utah 5
state mine safety officials defended the safety record at the mine. At a press confer- ’ I
ence, Casper Nelson, a member of the State Industrial Commission, said safety stand;-‘

ards were of the highest order. Prodded by reporters, Nelson claimed the operation

met both state and federal re-
quirements and added, “You

"just don’t quit digging because
methane is encountered.” ‘

Nelson’s claims * were sharply
contradicted by federal officials
and a survivor of the: tragedy.
On the day following the ex-
plosion, Interior Secretary Udall
told reporters President Ken-
nedy had again expressed his
concern over such disasters.
Udall added, “Initial reports in-
dicate clearly that elementary
safety precautions would have
prevented most of the serious
accidents which have occurred
this year. In the case of the
Utah Mine, for example, I am
informed that the contractors
were warned of the severe dan-
ger only three weeks ago when

methane gas was ignited while‘

workers were drilling rock bolt
holes in the drift where yester-
day’s explosion occurred._”Utah
Governor G e o r g e D. . Clyde.
promptly denounced . “the_ 
fortunate impressions created”
by Udall’s statement. ' A

The Bureau of Mines also re-
ported that three of the four
fatal accidents which took place
prior to the accident were pre-
ventable. Dona1d'Hanns, one of
the‘ survivors of the explosion
told reporters, “There .' were
just no safety practices” at the
mine. -

In Carbon County, ‘Utah, 180

miles from Moab, 100 coalmin-
ers walked off their jobs in a
protest strike against Utah
S t a t e Industrial Commission
practices, “and particularly

against Mr. Weisley” (Otto A.

Weisley, chairman of the com-
mission). Harold W. J ewkes,
president of one of the two
UMWA locals involved in the
strike said, 3“We don't want an-
other ‘Moab’ .disaster here. » We

want a. new state mine

spector.” . _

State Senator Frank C. ‘Mem-
mott (D.., Carbon County) indi-
cated disapproval of -Utah Gov-

ernor C1yde’.s_ action in giving

responsibility for “investigation
of the disaster to the Industrial
Commission. Memmott called
for a probe by the Utah legisla-
ture of the disaster and ofthe
Commission and its chairman,
Weisley.

 

   
   

HEADFRAME of the Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.'s potash mine

near Moab, Utah, where methane gas explosion killed 18

construction workers.

Development work at the
mine was under contract to

Harrison International Company ‘
of Miami, Florida. In telegrams _
to President Kennedy and Sec-

retary Udall requesting the

fullest possible investigation of

the disaster, Mine-"Mill. Presi-
dent A. C._ Skinner said in‘ part,

“Urge particular attention to.
role of development contractors
and possible short cuts by them ’

on approved_ safety practices,

Secretary Udall’s strong, state-

. .ment on the Moab disaster also

foreshadowed, for the first time,
;the position of the Interior De-
partment on pending mine
safety. legislation. He said the
.Department’s two-year study of

health and safety conditions at‘

will -be completed shortly.
(Deadline for the report is

Bisbee and Miami
Cases Arbitrated

BISBEE, Ariz.—Cases w er e
heard on two successive days,
August 15 and 16, in Bisbee and
Miami before Arbitrator Bert
Luskin of Chicago, with deci-
sions due after filing of briefs.

The case fought by Copper
Queen Miners Local 551 at Bis-

.bee involved the discharge of

John Panzer, a concentrator
employee. '
Panzer was fired for allegedly
sleeping on the job. At the hear-
ing, the Phelps Dodge Corpora-

‘tion’s evidence was presented
..by a supervisor and another

employee, not a Union member.
Their stories were vague and
and the Union
representatives present argued
that not only was proof lacking,
but that, in any event, dis-
charge could not be justified
where the member had not left
his regular place of work and
there had been no intentional
offense.

Local 551 President Winston
Elkins and Business Agent Da-
vid Duarte worked with Inter-
national Representative Sylvain
Schnaittacher on handling the
Union’s case. Panzer himself,
Grievance Man Curtis Vinson
and John Kemble appeared as
witnesses for the Union.

-At Miami, the case con-
cerned an attempt by the In-
spiration Consolidated Copper
Company to claim the right of
Leadburners, under the jurisdic-
tion of the Plumbers and Pipe-
fitters Union, to do work tra-
ditionally performed by helpers
in the Mine-Mill jurisdiction,
particularly stripping of the

lead sheathing from leach tanks. ..

Local 586 President ' Robert

Barcon worked with Schnait-

tacher on case preparation.
Shop Steward Albert C. Remos,
veteran lead shop employee
Juan Hernande and Angel Gon-
zales, long time local 586 lead-
er, testified for the Union.

One reason why the local Un-
ion has felt very strongly about
this case is because Mexican-
Americans, who make up al-
most the entire body of Lead
Shop helpers at Inspiration,
have been systematically de-
nied opportunity to become
leadburners. Relaxing "Mine-
Mill’s jurisdictional r i g h t s
could lead to elimination of
helpers in favor of retention of
the leadburners, and local mem-

crimination.

The hearing at Miami was
marked by the overturning of a
long time past practice on de-
nial of the stenographic record
of the hearing to the Union. In
the past, the Company had hired
a court reporter, and refused
the Union use of the transcript
unless it would share the cost.

Arbitrator Luskin ruled that

if the Company wanted the ar-

bitrator to have the use of the
record, the Union mustbe al-
lowed to use the arbitrator’s
copy for preparation of its brief.
Since the hearing, the Union
has been notified that the Com-
pany wishes to send the tran-
script to Luskin and will for-
ward it via the Union.

Auxiliary
Holds Picnic

BISBEE, Ariz.—A picnic was
held by Ladies Auxiliary Local
551 in honor of the Golden Wed-
ding Anniversary of Honorary
President John Clark and his
wife.

The Ladies Auxiliary present-
ed, the Clarks with a horse-and-
buggy TV lamp. When the gift
was presented by Sister E. Elk-
ins, Brother Clark commented
that on his first date with his
wife he took her on a horse and
buggy ride.

Brother W. Elkins, president
of L o c al 551, presented the
Clarks with a transistor clock-
radio.

Perth Amboy Wins

Arbitration

PERTH AMBOY, N. J .-Perth
Amboy Smelter and Refinery
Workers Union Local 365 has
won an important arbitration
decision involving’ posting of the
work schedule.

In accordance with the con-
tract, when the work schedule
is posted on a Thursday for the
coming week, the company does
not have the right to change a
man's schedule. If the company
does change the schedule, they
have to assume the penalty
which entitles a man to a sixth
day’s pay. -

To explain this brieﬂy, if an
employee is scheduled off on a
Tuesday and is told to come in
on Tuesday, the company can-
not give him another day off
to deprive the worker of six
days.

The arbitrator ruled that the
company does have the right to

85-Ton Truck-

lnspected

BAYARD, N.M.—The old is
certainly making way for the
new at the Kennecott open pit
mine these days. The company’s
program to convert fully from
rail to truck haulage in the pit

is now in full swing. The first ‘

of nineteen 65 and 85 ton trucks
started arriving on July 22.
The company will use sixteen
65-ton trucks. Three 85-ton trucks
will be used on a six-month
trial basis. The first truck to
arrive is the 85 tonner shown in
the photo on page-7. The com-
pany invited Local 890 officers
to look it over. These trucks
are huge! They stand 16’2” in
height. They weigh over 50 tons
and, of course, have a load capa-
city of 85 tons. The tires alone
are 8 feet high. Each of the
rear wheels is driven by an

electric m o t o r. The electric '

generator is driven by a 700
horsepower diesel motor.

The conversion to truck haul-
age of ore and waste in the pit
is part of the company’s long

term program for economy and
efficiency. It seems that laying .

and maintaining track is very
expensive. Trucks are more
mobile and can operate on
sharper inclines.

The additional trucks will be
operated by Mine-Mill mem-
bers. While the track gang will
just about be wiped out, Mine-
Mill will gain additional truck
drivers, mechanics . and utility
men. -- »

‘and 7:00 P.M. so as to provide
those working afternoon shift an .
"opportunity to ‘participate.

Twenty-one members took part

-in the first sessions held on

ternational Representative J. P.
Mooney is conducting the classes
and acting as Instructor. _

The Local Union has planned

"a Banquet for all members-who

complete the Training Program.
Wives of members who partici-
pate are also invited to the Ban-

Morenci Miners '

Prepare Demands

CLIFTON, Ariz.—M o r e n c i
Miners Union Local 616 has es-
tablished a special bargaining
committee to prepare for major
bargaining in 1964.

A committeeman has been ap-
pointed by the Local Executive
Board for every department of
every division. Members of the
committee will contact every-

one in the union in an effort to-

list all of the problems and to
project contract changes.

’ A coordinating committee has
also been set up to compile the
material turned in by depart-
ment representatives.

L o‘ c a 1 616 President Carl

‘Krass emphasized the role of
the rank-and-file membership

‘in formulating bargaining de-

mands. Said Krass, “Every
member on the job has a vital
role toplay, so that nothing is
overlooked. The Union must de-
pend on every one of you to call
problems to the attention of the
bargaining committee.”

T h e r e are 63 departmental
representatives on the Commit-
tee. The coordinating committee

Morales, David Velasquez, and
Edward G. Marquez.

Bayard Wins

Grievance

Bayard 890 won an important
grievance recently at the Ken-
necott smelter at Hurley, New
M e x i c 0. Last December the
company assigned an IAM
member to operate a crane on a
day when the smelter was down
and Machinists were making re-
pairs. The craneman job is in
‘Mine-Mill’s jurisdiction and the

union immediately invoked" the
grievance machinery. Local 890
took the position. that a crane-
man should have been called‘ in."

The grievance went through

the third step and was headed.

for arbitration—in fact, an arbi-
trator was selected. At the last
minute, rather than face an al-
most certain award to the un-
ion, the company _caved in, pay-
ing ca_1l-in pay to the Mine-Mill
craneman and agreeing to dis-
continue the practice of assign-
ing Machinists to this work.

Ray, Hayden
Stewards Classes

HAYDEN, Ariz.—A four-proj-
gram educational series for lo_-
cal officers and stewards is un-
derway here. Both Local 886
and Local 939 are participating
in the series, which was. ar-
ranged by International Rep.
Sylvain Schnaittacher, with the
assistance of International Rep.
Jacob Mercado.

The first program, held Aug.
21,_ was well attended at both
morning and evening sessions.
Topic of the first program was
“Grievance. Handling.”

Subsequent sessions have as "

s u_b j e c ts “The Shop Steward
System,” “Safety and Compen-
sation,” and “History and De-
fense of the Union.” ‘ ~
Melesio Chavez, Vice Presi-
dent of Local 886, headed up
the evening meeting of the first
class. A large number of offi-
cers and stewards attended and
there was lively discussion of
such questions as how to prop-
erly write up grievances, how to
react to grievances of non-mem-
bers, and how to improve han-
dling of disciplinary and dis-
charge cases. ' ‘
The program was instituted

has the result of a request by lo-

cal leaders to District 2 Board
Member Macclovio R. Barraza,
and present plans are to follow
up with separate series for the
two loc als concentrating on
study of contracts. Examination
of the- agreements will be direct-
ed not only toward enforcement
of their provisions but also to
spotting sections that need im-

provement in _next year’s nego-

tiations.

Wins New Wage Pact

_ E. ST. LOUIS, ILL.——Fa_irmont Smelter Workers Local 82 has
signed with the American Zinc Co. a one-year‘ agreement provid-
ing more than 11 cents per hour in wages and fringes.

Negotiations took place as a result of a mbnetary opener at
the end of the second year of a three-year contract that will ex-

pire June 30, 1964.

After twelve separate sessions, the union and the company

agreed upon the following pro-
visions:

Four weeks vacation with pay
after 25 years. Seventy-three
per cent of the members have
the requisite 25 years service.

Three cents an hour across
the board. A

Company to pay $3.47 per
month in excess of their pres-
ent 75 per cent toward the full

cost of the Health and Welfare
program. This will amount to
the company paying approxi-
mately 871/2 per cent of the
present H&W program.

The company will pay the
difference between a man’s
regular rate of pay and what
the government pays a man

In the early stages of these
negotiations, the membership
voted 97 per cent in favor of
striking to back up their de-
mands. Later, when it ap-
peared the company was un-

necessarily dragging out nego-

tiations, the Local stopped all
overtime and set up an en-
larged strike committee that
met with the negotiations com-
mittee after each session with
the company. The Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Ser-
vice participated in the last
four sessions with the company.

Members of the negotiating
committee were Max Yovan-

Banner Strikers Charge
‘Deal With Anaconda’

TUCSON—As We go to press, Word has been re-
ceived that a meeting between Banner Mining Company
and the Negotiating Committee of Local 929 was set up

for Thursday, August 29.

The local has been on strike
at the underground property
near Tucson, Arizona since May
27, with membership morale
high and excellent support from
other locals in the Southwest,
as well as Utah Local 392 and
the International Union Strike
Fund. ‘

An important factor in the
bargaining picture has been the
existence of an option on the

Banner properties by Anaconda‘

Copper Company, with the .Un-
ion, until recently, unable to dis-
cover the Banner company’s
intentions with regard to future
operation. I
An Arizona Employment Se-

curity Commission hearing was

utilized by the Union to smoke
out the whole Anaconda ideal.
Under Arizona law, workers
idled by a “labor dispute” are

not entitled to unemployment’

insurance. In view of the un-
certain status of the Banner
Company’s Tucson operation,
the Union countered with a
claim that the property was
actually shut down by the Com-
pany. Sufficient evidence was

presented on this possibility at
a hearing earlier in the month
to force the Commission to or-
der Banner Manager Allen Bow-
man to appear and testify on
the Ananconda option.

Bowman revealed, at a spe-
cial hearing on August 19, that
the option gives Anaconda the
right to select parcels of the
extensive Banner holdings for
lease, and the option runs until
April of 1964. He said that this

meant that it was impossible to.

tell at this time whether Ana-
conda would lease the present

_ workings ‘ at the‘ Palo Verde

shaft, now struck. ,He also.

stated that there was a body of

developed ore which the Com-
pany would mine immediately if.
the strike was settled.

Immediately after -the close of-

the Employment Security Com-_

mission hearing. steps were in-,
bar-.

itiated ‘for setting up the
gaining session. , r -

Industry Gains Significant  

By Irving Dichter , 

International Secretary-Treasurer

EAD AND ZINC prices have been in the news in recent?‘

months. Last month zinc was "selling at 121/2. cents per pound; 7_

It’s been over two-and-a-half years since zinc has been this ‘high. ‘I -7

Zinc smelters questioned recently by the Wall Street Journal expect f  .-

_ another boost‘ of ‘one-half to one cent a pound early this fall. 

Lead went up to 11% cents last month, marking its sixth price , A
increase since last November when lead was selling at a 15-year
. low of 91/2 cents. Strong demand, marked by steadily declining _ _

producers’ stocks of both metals, has been
the consistent feature of the market over
most of this year. ‘ -
Every increase of a cent in price means
a million dollars in profits before taxes for
every 50,000§tons of lead or zinc produced
by. integrated companies with mining and
smelting operations. With. this kind of lure
it_’s no surprisethat, New Jersey Zinc Com
pany is about to reopen its mine at Han-_
over, New Mexico and that American Metal ,
Climax is stepping up production‘ at its »'
Blackwell, Oklahoma zinc smelter. Laid-off
men at both properties are being recalled.
The copper companies have held the , - » —
price at 31 cents for nearly two and ’a half years, and have.

' reaped lush profits. Gross income last year—mostly from sales"

of metal and metal products—of Anaconda, Kennecott, Magma

and Phelps Dodge, was over a billion and a half dollars, yielding a '
comfortable gross profits totaling over $300 million. There is no,

present indication that the price of copper will change.

DECISION by the Supreme Court of the State of Washington‘? ‘ —

, in July probably goes further in holding unions responsible‘

line in 1959. The Local Union and the International Union were
also made defendants. Despite the fact that there was no evidence‘
that either the Local or International Unions, through any of their
officers, agents, or representatives, had anything to do with the"
alleged assault, directly or indirectly, the Washington Supreme
Court‘ upheld jury verdicts against both the Local and the Inter-.

"national (as well as againstthe two pickets personally)- H 
1” it   .* *"_*   
_' , -HA-T the Washington Court did was to apply the rule that_

an employer is responsible foran assault committed_by his

employee if the assault is committed “within the scope of the em-‘,.

ployment.” In other words, in order to hold the unions liable, the"

Court in effect held that any picket is an “employee” of both 5“

local union and its international. What makes the decision so ex-
treme is that the trial judge did not even permit the defendants
to introduce evidence that the International had nothing whatever
to do even with the setting. up of the picket line. . '

It is hard to imagine a_ decision which opens the door so wide. — it

to frame-up damage suits against unions. The decision .me‘,an_s‘_
that, in any strike,‘ both the local and its international union can

be held liable for damages for any assault .comm_itted by any’ I

picket, no matter to what extent the unions try to dissociate them-

selves from any violence. If every picket is automatically an ‘‘em-. 

ployee’? of both the local and the international, as the Washington:
Court holds, then the unions are automatically liable. .

* * * I .
TTORNEY John Caughlan of Seattle, who has been represent-
ing Local 25 and the International, has filed a petition for

I rehearing with the Court and it is hoped that it will be supported 7

by the labor movement in the State of Washington. If the petition
is denied, it will be essential to launch an all-out eﬁort to have
the Washington legislature pass a law to negate the court decision
and to have unions held liable in cases such as this only when
they are directly responsible for misconduct through

officers, . .

THE MINE-MILL UNION"

Trail Officers Testify
At Royal Commission

TRAIL, B. C.—With many months of intense preparation behind them, officers of
Local 480 have been presenting evidence beforea Royal Commission of Inquiry in sup-
port of pending legislation to improve the provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation

Act.

The Commission of Inquiry is conducting hearings in Nelson, B. C. under the Hon-
orable Alexander’ Campbell DesBrisay, former Chief Justice of the Province of British

Columbia. .
Local 480 has sponsored wit-

nesses who have given in evi-

dence their unfortunate experi-

ences in claiming compensa- ‘

tion and otherwise supporting
a lengthy brief compiled by the
Local.

The keynote of the Mine-Mill
presentations—“So .that justice
may be done” — was under-
scored time and time again, as
evidence was brought forward
showing callous disregard by
the Workmen’s Compensation
Board for human feeling, de-
lay in accepting claims which
created hardships, and outright
rejection of claims with rea-
sons for rejection obscure and
Vag1.1€.- .

Brothers R. Morandini and J.
Flanagan conveyed to the Com-
mission th e i r overwhelming
frustration in dealing with the
Board on behalf of injured
workmen.’ Indeed in some cases
_“the raising of objections by
the Board on one account has
been followed by a second and
even a third obstacle when
each of the prior ones has been
surmounted and it seems to
us that once having initially
denied a claim the Board and
its administrators resent any
challenge whatsoever of their
initial decision. ‘

Union sponsored two‘ scholar-
ships for local high school stu-
dents to attend the music camp
at Arizona State University.
The two students who received
this year’s scholarships were
Stephany ‘Smith and Lucy Fier-
ro. Lucy is the daughter of
Brother John Fierro who works
as a Lime Kiln operator in the
Smelter Division.

Stephany wrote to thank the
union for the scholarship and

Q , said she had found the experi-

"1’-',"'~

ence at the music camp “very
inspirational." Lucy wrote that
“It was a great experience and
it gave me a chance to meet
some of the really good young
musicians in Arizona and other
states. It also made mexmore
interested in my music. Thank
you again.”

brothers working in the track
maintenance department played
a game in one of the local
parks. The team from the lower

track area of the open pit won
the game. -It is reported that
some of the brothers, caught
trying to‘ steal bases or stretch
their hits a bit too far, were

B.C. Strikers-
‘Alive and Kicking’

(Below is reprinted Strike Bulletin No. 12, dated

‘August 12, issued by the plucky strikers of Local 901,

Salmo, B. 0'. As we go to press, the strike against the
Reeves-MacDonald Corp. is entering its 18th week.) -

Fifteen men on a deal man’s
chest. Yo ho ho and a bottle of
rum! No doubt Reeves Mac-
Donald would like to be sitting
on the Union’s chest. But this
is no dead man. No, sir! So, yo
ho ho and fifteen weeks of
strike, alive and kicking!

And we have a right to kick.
At the bargaining (?) table,
Reeves’ refrain was “the price
of lead and zinc!” This was
thundered at us, drummed into
us, and emphasized at all times
as the main reason no increase
could be considered. Now, with
all four of Reeves” metals (cad-
mium, silver, lead, zinc) having
made spectacular jumps, silence
is all they have to offer. I

This week we award the fur-
lined spare tire to “Sandy”
Kraft, Salmo taxi owner, for his
offer of free transportation to
any of the strikers needing hos-
pitalization. For the benefit of
those who are familiar. with
these parts, this means a hund-
red mile round trip. He has our
sincere thanks.

We again have interference
in Union business by Reeves’
manager. His advice to a striker
to ask his bargaining commit-
tee if he could go back to work
is unwarranted and unwanted.

Our advice to company offici-

als: Learn how to run your own
business properly before you
try to run ours.

We recognize the fact that
some people take longer than
others to realize certain truths.
Evidently Reeves is not yet con-
vinced thatthe Union means
business. However, if they want
to find out, they have only to

ask any striker — any one at
all! e ‘

Labour M.P. James Hill

To Attend 13th Convention

TORONTO—.James Hill, the Labour Party Member
of the British House of Commons from Midlothians in
Scotland has accepted an invitation from the Interna-

. tional Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (Canada) .
to attend the Union’s Thirteenth National Convention to-

be held in Sudbury next September 16th, it was an-
nounced here today by William Longridge, National Sec-

retary-Treasurer.

The invitation was extended
to Mr. Hill following a tour by
a fraternal delegation from
Mine Mill to the Scottish Section
convention of the National Un-
ion of Mineworkers in Dundee
in June. This exchange of dele-
gates marks the second time
there has been a delegation
from Scotland attending the
Mine Mill convention in Canada’,
the first occasion having been
in 1957 in Kimberley.

The purpose of such ex-
changes is to further under-
standing between the Canadian

workers, particularly in ‘the
mining industry, and mining in-

dustry workers from other coun- ,

tries,‘ Mr. Longridge said. At
the National Convention held in
Toronto in 1959, a delegate from

the Australian Miners Union had ,

been in attendance.

Arrangements for Mr. Hill's A

visit to Canada are presently
under way. Visiting the conven-
tion from the United States will
be International Vice-President
Asbury Howard and District 5
Board Member Alfred Petit-
Clair. -

Three Year Contract Signed    A 
With Falconbridge Nickel    

TORONTO, ‘On't.—Agreement
has been reached with Falcon-

bridge ‘Nickel Mines for a

three-year contract ‘based on
the recommendations of a_ Con-
ciliation Board. The agreement
calls for wage increases total-
ing 8 per cent. -

The first increase of three per
cent is retroactive to June 15,
1963, with two further increases
of two-and-one-half per cent be-
coming effective June 15, 1964
and June 15, 1965. In some
classifications additional wage
increases are effective imme-
diately.

The agreement provides in-
creases in life insurance cov-
erage from $2,500 to $5,000 for
married employees and from
$1,000 to $2,000 for single em-
ployees. . .

Present sickness and accide
benefits have been increased
from $40 per week for 26 weeks
to $50 per week for 32 Weeks.

_ Both life insurance and sick-
ness and accident benefits are

on a 50/50 contributory basis
and-because effective as of Au-
gust 26; Any employee present-
ly away from work’ through
sickness or accident and draw-
ing ‘ benefits will draw the in-
creased‘ benefits‘ immediately.
With regard to PSI, the Com-
pany will pay 60 per cent of the
premium cost instead of the
50 per cent paid previously.
The statutory holiday clause
has been improved to allow
leave of’ absence for court ap-
pearances and family deaths
which allows an employee to be
absent on qualifying days for
statutory holidays. Agreement
has been reached_ in allowing
for two union representatives
to be part of each surface
safety committee. , - - A

The bargaining committee was ‘

told th at the Falconbridge
Nickel Company estimates the
increased settlement at 24.5
cents per hour.

The agreement comes after
many months of bargaining

which was disrupted by the.

raiding of the Steelworkers and

resulted in a heavy vote in.
favor of strike when the Con- .

cﬂiation Board failed to recom-
mend full retroactivity to the
termination date of the old con-
tract in March 1962.

The Board, however, did rec-,

ognize the principle of retroac- ,.

tivity by dating the wage in-.
creases from June 15 rather
than the date of ratification of
the agreement as was the case
with the Steelworkers at INCO.

Following the strike vote, the
National Executive Board met
with the Local 598 Executive
and the Falconbridge bargain-
ing committee and upon re-
fusal of the Company to budge
on such matters as retroac-

tivity,’sick leave and increased

annual vacations, recommended
the acceptance of an agree-

ment based on the Conciliation‘

Board recommendations. This’
was accepted in a referendum

U. S. TARIFF COMMISSION was rapped in a statement issued
last month by the AFL-CIO Executive Council for “rigidly techni-
calinterpretations” of the Trade Expansion Act which became law
last October. The act provides special federal unemployment bene-
fits to over $60 per week for up to one year, and other assistance
to workers losing their jobs due to increased imports resulting

- from past tariff reductions.

Mine-Mill was the first union to apply for these benefits—on
behalf of 126 zinc miners laid off with the shutdown last December
1 of the New Jersey Zinc Company mine at Hanover, New Mexico.

The petition was turned down by the Tariff Commission. The
action was denounced at the time by then Mine-Mill President John

Clark ._as contrary to, Congressional intent. Mine-Mill’se Interna-

tional Convention adopted a resolution condemning the action of
the Commission and calling for a congressional investigation and

l . remedial _action.

Since then, three AFL-CIO‘ unions, the International Union of

» Electrical Workers, the Textile Workers, and the Steelworkers-

have filed similar petitions on behalf of laid-off transistor and

‘cotton sheeting workers, and iron ore miners. All three were also

turned down by the Tariff Commission. These turn-downs prompt-
ed the AFL-CIO Executive Council statement. It said, in part,
“in no case thus far has the Commission indicated a desire to
implement the new trade program’s provision of adjustment assist-
ance for workers.” It went on to say that unless there is relief
from these -“narrow interpretations” of the law, the AFL-CIO
“will be compelled to insist on amendment of the statute” to pre-
vent future misinterpretations of congressional intent “on adminis-
trative avoidance of adjustment assistance to workers.”

_ These beefs by Mine-Mill and the AFL-CIO have the Kennedy
administration worried. The Wall Street Journal late last month
reported rumors that Kennedy-appointed Tariff Commission Chair-
man Ben Dorfman may -be eased out. The White House has

already moved to soften up the stiff-necked attitude of the Com-
missiongby appointing a former presidential aide, Dan- Fenn, to a
..vacancy, and reportedly is searching for new applicants for assist-
ants, in the hope that the Tariff Commission this time will feel the
pressure that has built up. No application from a labor union

URANIUM mining boom, which went ﬂat years ago in Canada
when U. S. mine reserves were proved out, is now petering out
in the»U. S. as the Atomic Energy Commission’s cutbacks on
purchasing of U. S.-produced ores go into effect. Seven uranium
mills have shut down in the last two years, while an AEC official
predicts only 12 to 14 of 21 presently operating U. S. mills will be
left by 1967. - '

Mines as well as mills have cut back. Anacond-a’s mine and
mill at Bluewater, New Mexico, is down to 350 workers from 950
four years ago. Mine and mill employment at Grants, New Mexico,
is down to 1,835 from 2,181 last year. 150 houses built for workers
in ‘Grants are now empty, despite rentcuts up to 40 percent. Other
uranium producing centers such as Moab, Utah and Riverton,
Wyoming have also been hit hard.

TACOMA, Washington copper smelter and refinery of Ameri-
can Smelting and Refining Company scheduled a two-week cutback
in operations last month due to lagging receipts of copper concen-
trates from overseas sources of supply. “Normal” operations at
about 50 percent of the plant’s rated capacity were resumed later

in the -month. The curtailment, as well as the low level. of normal 8-

operations, reflects the difficulty the plant has been experiencing
in bidding for copper concentrates in competition with the sub-
sidized and low-cost copper smelting industry in Japan.

uck Fall

Duffy J. Varner, an electrician employed at Anaconda Company's Steward mine
in Butte, was killed July 11 in a shaft accident. He suffered a skull fracture, crushed

- chest and broken arm from a fall of muck from as mixing pocket at the 4,000 level.

Varner was in a chippy cage at the 4200 level, to which about 3 tons of muck fell. The
falling muck dished the quarter inch stainless steel bonnet of the cage, but Varner is
believed to have been killed by muck ricocheting into the cage from the sides of the

shaft.

According to the U.S. Bureau
of Mines’ report on the acci-
dent, the saturation of muck in
the-pocket with water was the
prime cause of the accident.
The chute gate into the pocket
was jammed, and the wet muck
boiled over the side boards into
the skip tender’s station and
then into the chippy compart-
ment.

The Bureau recommended im-’

mediate action to divert any fu-
ture overﬂows of muck away

’ from the chippy compartment

of the shaft and into the skip
compartment. The Bureau also
recommended that all other
skiploading stations should be
examined and necessary altera-
tions done to prevent muck spill
into shaft compartments where

.men are working or being trans-

ported. -

Fissure manganese mine, op-
erated by .-the Taylor-Knapp
Company, Philipsburg, Mon-
tana, lists 33 recommendations
made in the original safety sur-
vey last year still requiring at-
tention by the company. Among
these are the following:

0 The air receiver should be
provided with a safety release
valve.

0 The compressor air intake

should be extended outside of

the compressor building to in-
sure pure air entering the com-
pressor.

O The openings at the man-
way entrance to the shaft should
be guarded properly.

0 The maintenance platform
at the sheave wheels of the

shaft headframe should be pro- p

vided with handrails.

O The cutoff circular timber
saw and drives, and the table

mounted circular saw should

be provided’ with guards. i

o All buildings within 9.1, oral-.'
'dius of 100 -feet from any mine‘

opening should be of fireproof

for fire-resistant construction.

O_ Fire extinguishers should
be inspected and tested at least
once each 6 months, and a dated
record should be attached to

_each extinguisher tested.

0 Compressor oil kept at the
compressor building should be
removed and stored at the oil
house, and only a 2 to 3 day
supply kept at the compressor
building.

0 A second hoistman should ‘
be in attendance at all tinies_

while men are being hoisted gojr,

10 w e r e (1 unless the __ hoist is"

O Compressed-air safety cut-
off valves and safety footboard
mountings should be provided
and installed on all mechani-
cal mucking equipment.

O Mechanic al ventilation
should be provided at the 804
drift west and 804 stope to
maintain at least 30 f.p.m. ve-
locity of air in working. places.

0 Management should con-
sider the _installation of water

United Mine Workers President, W. A. “Tony” Boyle testi-

fied last -month before a House Labor Subcommittee in favor of, 7
amendments to. the Federal Coal Mine Safety Act to include’ 

small mines which-are now exempted. He said in part:

“Men required to work in small mines are equally ‘entitled to _ _y‘'
the same protection -under the law as employes working in mines’: ' ‘
employing more than 14 men. ‘-Is it legal and proper’-or is it fair--.
to permit small mine: operators by design,’inaction, carelessness-.7
or for any other reason to kill and cripple men merely because - 
they work in mines employing less than 14- men? By what stretch 

of’ the imagination can Congress say that it is illegal to kill ‘or
maiin men in mines employing more than 14 men by passing laws

to protect them and, yet,. at the "same time legalize killing andf S
maiming men in small mines by denying them the same protection‘
accorded to their more fortunate fellow miners employed in ‘-the ~ ’

so-called large mines.

“Before the passage of the Federal Coal Mine Safety bill in_;f,—
1952 when Federal inspectors were given the right to close any’ 

mine where a dangerous condition existed, the coal industry killed
as many as 2500 men per year while injuries amounted to as many
as 50,000 per year. Since passage of the Act, deaths have fallen
to a low of 287 in 1962 and there were between 11,000 and 12,000
injuries. This is still too many but it is a far cry from the old
haphazard inspections of the years prior to 1952. -i

“Mine safety was not voluntarily enacted for the coal industry. T
It has been a savage fight, step by step, with the majority of the -
industry opposing every attempt to bring about safer conditions '7

for those who toil below the earth’s surface . . .

“State inspection has improved remarkably since the passage ‘
of the Federal Coal Mine Safety bill. This is due entirely to the. '

checks and balances provided by Public Law 552. The possibility-

of Federal inspectors examining any mine has kept state inspec-

tors on their toes. In some states they have been more cooperative

and more efficient since Federal inspection has been available. In-
-stead of duplication of effort which was preached by the opponents "

of Federal inspection service, we find a degree of mutual under-
standing and cooperation.” -

Boyle recounted his experiences during the Bear Creek,Mont.,
disaster on February 27, 1943, which took the lives of 75 coal min-
ers. As a result of-the disaster, all-out efforts were made-to re-

. write the Montana coal mine safety law. Boyle said that Montana
had never had a more capable Attorney General than Congressman - ».
Arnold Olsen, and that he was the state official who contributed r

most to bringing Montana’s coal mines safety law up to date.

Boyle said that the Bear Creek explosion, like all other mining-

explos-ions, could have been prevented.

' Boyle noted that in 1943, Federal coal mine‘ inspectors -did‘

not have authority to shut down hazardous coal mines but only

‘to inspect them. He noted that Federal inspectors, had reported.
thatthe Bear Creek mine was in a hazardous condition and that p

it might blow up.

“Sixty days to the exact date is when it blew up,” Boyle said.
He stated that 30 days prior to the Bear Creek disaster, a Montana-
coal mine inspector went into the mine and came out with a one-
page- report “like ‘these state coal mine in_spect'ors‘usually, dof’

Boyle said the report ‘gave a “green light” to operate the mine“; 1'

Thirty days after this state inspection, 74 men, were killed in the
Bear Creek explosion, and one man died in the rescue operations.

President Boylenoted. that among those who were killed were

some of his relatives, including an uncle whose body'Boyle found .

in the shambles of the mine. “They all died horrible deaths, Mr.

Chairman,” Boyle said. “They were beyond recognition and 74

caskets were sealed; no one could look at them.”

Boyle emphasizedthe fact that the multitude of state mining
‘laws are inadequate to protect the‘ lives of American coal miners.
‘He said that while some of "the state laws have been improved
‘since amendmentof the Federal law in 1952, there; are innumer-
able instances of continuing violation of the state ‘laws; Boyle,

charged that political pressure is used against state mine inspec-

' ‘tors, even though the law in the state may be adequate. The re-

sult is, the UMWA witness said, that the state laws are not being

‘enforced and that the opponents of Federal legislation are asking _l

the Congress to aid them in evasion of safety standards.-

-President Boyle said that while there may be an‘ instance
where a Federal mine inspector does not do all the things he is
supposed to do, nevertheless the U. S. Bureau of Mines under its
present directorship and its administrative officers has improved

not only remarkably but almost unbelievably.

, “I think they have done a ‘splendid job. I think they are con-

tinuing to do a splendid job,” Boyle said of the Bureau of Mines’ ‘

personnel.’ “I think the director and his associates . . . are devoted

' people, outstanding people,‘ and people who have concern for the: .

lives of the miners . . .”
