Capital Voodoo Fails

To Brake U. S. Slump

The United States economy continued to decline last month.
This is a cold, unvarnished statement of fact, a type of economic reporting
abandoned lately by a number of financial writers and various agencies of the Fed-

The slump goes

on. In support of this simple state

ment are such ' facts as the

following:

1 Despite the efforts of

- the Commerce department to

cover uplthe truth with “esti-
mates” showing that unem-
ployment had declined from
March to April, the fact is
that the decline was only a
fraction of what it should
have been on a seasonal basis.
Ordinarily, unemployment has
dropped by about a half mil-
lion workers between, Febru-
ary "and April. This year, how-
_ever, the drop was only 53,000.
The April unemployment
fig ure, the latest available,
was 5,120,000. ’
Adjusted for season varia-
tion, U. S. government fig-
ures actually showed that
i unemployment rose from 7
per cent in March to 71/; per-

Leading in
Union Vote

DENVER—-Early and unof-
ficial reports as the Mine-Mill
Union went to press indicated
that rank-and-file , members of
the union had cast a majority
of their ballots in favor of two
important amendments to the
union’s constitution.

Incomplete reports from 10-
cal union officers and inter-
nationalrepresentatives
showed the two propositions
carrying in most sections of
the union. Official and final
results of the referendum will
not be known or announced
until the returns are certified
by the International Canvass-
ing committee, which meets in
Denver starting Monday, June
16. Members of the committee
were elected by the March con-
vention in Denver. They are:

Ernest Lopez, Local 393,
for District 1; Ed Lomeli,
Local 937, for District 2;
Melvin Green, Local 632, for
District 3; Eugene Hood, Lo-
cal 809, for District 4; El-
bert McMullin, Local 838,
for District 5; John Infu-
sion, Local 365, for District.
6, and Glen A. Freeman, Lo-

cal 911, for District 7. In ‘

addition, Mine-Mill in Can-

ada will select a member for

the committee. .
PROPOSITION NO. '1 in, the
referendum will reduce Cana-

dian per capita, initiation and " ‘I

reinstatement fees to the In-
ternational Union from the

present 45 cents, and Cana- ~ ~-

dian assessments from 45 per
cent. The reduction will al-
low a greater amount of Ca-
nadian per capita to remain in
Canada for organization. Ca-
nadian -members voted on

separate ballots -on; per capita‘ - 

of Canadian locals to the na-
_tional union in Canada. Indi-

cations at press time were A

that the issue carried. - »
PROPOSITION N O. 2 in the

referendum will retain the

‘referendum vote for officers,

salaries, per capita tax, and i ‘

other basic democratic guar-

antees of the union Congtitu.-

tion, and will eliminate the un-
necessary expense of submit-
ting those minor changes to

referendum vote which can be a

TIMES ‘ of May 18.
The metals crisis was very
. much in the news despite the

. ‘ lack of visible progress to-

~ ward providing any form of
effective relief » for the de-
pressed condition of the in-
dustry. Major developments
during the month included:

I. Two major copper. pro-
ducers ——' Phelps Dodge and

production cutbacks. P. D.,
_second largest domestic pro-
ducer, was to cutback out-
put by another 42,000 tons
annual rate on- top of pre-
vious cuts since
'_1956, of 63,000 tons. Total re-
duction, ’ so far, amounts to
about 40 per cent. “In effect,
this means that our copper
miners are working on a
four-day rather than a five-
day week,” said P. D. Presi-
dent Robert C. Page.

2. Lead prices dropped an-
other half-cent on May 14 to
111/2 cents, at which price it
was s t i ll two-and-one-half
cents above the -rest of the
world. Lead stocks in the
hands of primary refiners, at
the end of April, were at the

highest level since mid-1938,;

despite further reductions in
mine output. With govern-

ment purchasesfor the stock-

pile scheduled to end next
month, present surpluses are
bound to become still. larger,
barring some new_.--govern-
ment action. ~

3_ New Jersey Zinc shut
‘down its mine at Hanover,
N. M., its roaster at Canon
City, Colo., and laid off more
workers ‘at its Eastern smelt»
ers.

Zinc prices, although re-
'maining steady during the
month at 10 cents a pound,
were under considerable pres-
sure from lower prices in
European markets; zinc was
selling in London at 7.7 cents.

4; The eight-week" strike
at. Anaconda’s Chuquicamata
mine in Chile ended with an

' agreement that gave workers

a 25 per cent wage increase
plus fringe benefits. Total
production lost by the strike

—'was— estimated at 40,000 tons.

 Prospects» for restriction’

of metal imports in the near
future dimmed as the House

Ways and Means committee

rejected" the Ikard amend-.

ment to the Reciprocal Trades
Agreement act and the ad-

ministration made clear its
opposition to setting of im-
port quotas. “ V
The I_k a r d, amendment
would have set a flat four
‘cents tariff on imports of
copper, lead and zinc when-:1
-ever prices for these ‘metals
fell below peril points of
30, 17 and 141/; cents, re-'
spectively. The Ways and
Means, committee also re-
ported out a bill that -would
extend the Trade Agree-
ments act for five years
but would subject Presi-
dential rejection of Tariff

.tions to a two-thirds veto
of both houses of Con-
gress.

The fight by all groups in
Montana opposing a “right to

into high gear with the Mon-

including Mine-Mill, spear-
heading the counter-attack. In

that there should be other
persons in ‘the various de-
partments of the state gov-
ernment who could have fur-
nished accurate information ~

Douglas’ request.”

Earlier, Salvas spoke at a
symposium sponsored by the
Montana Association for Re-
habilitation in Butte May 8
and 9. He stressed the need
for strengthening existing pro-
grams in order that they may
more fully meet the need for
rehabilitation of the indus-
trially injured. These injured,

clude the occupationally dis-
eased worker.

Prices a Scandal

E CONOMIC slumps have usually meant less
production-, fewer jobs, and lower prices.
What’s unique about the present recession is
that while production and employment have
dropped drastically, prices keep moving up.
Living costs have moved -   
up 22 times in the past
25 months'—with the big-
gest increases in the cost
of food and services.

Grocery prices now are
16 per cent higher than
they were 10 years ago.
In the first three months
of this year, they reached
a new record high. Prices
received by farmers for _
crops and livestock last ' 
year, believe it or not, were 15 per cent less
than 10 years ago.

 

1 I I‘

The Difference

Back in 1948 the farmer got 51 per cent of
what you spent for farm products at the gro-
cery or supermarket. Today, according to the
Department of Agriculture, he gets only 41 per

_ cent. Thus prices are going up in the grocery

store and down on the farm. .

How come? The answer really isn’t as
difficult as many so-called experts would like
us to believe. In simple language, both the
worker and the farmer are being “taken” by
the giant food companies which dictate prices
at both ends. Included in this bunch are the
chain grocers, canners, meat packers, dairies,
flour millers, tobacco companies, and other
food processors and distributors. Out’. of
every dollar that you spend for food today,
59 cents goes to companies handling the food
after it leaves the farm. ' ‘ ~ .-

The success of these companies in milking
both farmers and workers is shown in -their
profit statements. The food companies are one
of the few groups which, contrary to the gen-
eral decline in profits, keep raking in more
and more. Their shares on Wall Street are
selling at new highs this year despite the gen-

eral slump in stock prices.

* 1 * #

Food Chains Worst

“The Food Chains Lead the Way” is the
heading on a recent Business Week A article

reporting that “in both sales and profits, gains‘

by the grocery stores outdistance the field.”.
Of 48‘com'panies that had sales of over a
billion dollars last year, nine were food and
tobacco companies. The Atlantic and Pacific‘
Tea company had sales of over $41/; billion;

. Swift, $2.5 billion; Safeway, $2.1 billion;

Kroger, $1.7 billion; National .Dairy, $L4
‘billion, etc. =

Their profits are increasing faster than

' their sales. Safeway, the second ranking food
1 chain, gained 6.4 per cent in sales and 21.641

per cent in profits last year; in 1956 it gained
86.5 per cent in profits on a 3 per cent increase
in sales. And it’s the same story with all the
other food chains and processors.

What’s been happening, as even the Depart-
ment of Agriculture recognizes, is that, as the
result of mergers and buying out of small

competitors, the companies that buy food from .

the farmers and sell it to consumers are get-
ting larger and fewer in number. The farmer
doesn’t have much choice as to where he. can
sell and, with the virtual disappearance of the
corner grocery, you don’t have too much choice
as to where you can buy. .

$'¥'¥

‘ A Prime Example

This is a prime example of what our anti-
trust laws were supposed to control and pre-
vent. The Department of Justice, responsible
for anti-trust enforcement, isn't moving,
though, on this type of action. And Secretary
of Agriculture Ezra Taft’ Benson, -who is sup-
posed to enforce the anti—monopoly laws
against the meat industry, is palsy-walsy with
the head lobbyist for the American Meat insti-
tute.

His department, supposed to represent

. the interests of the farmer, has been loaded

with representatives of the big meat packers,

dairy companies, and grain processors. And

they’re definitely not out to get a better deal
for the farmers.

And all of us, as a result of this kind of
stacked deal, are paying through the nose. We
have, in effect, taken an 11 per cent cut in our
food dollars, just in the last two years.

This is one of those issues that is going
to require a lot more action by all of us.——OR-

WASHINGTON, D. C.--The
big question which every
worker in our industry is most
concerned about on the legis-
lative front is when Congress
is going to do something
about copper, lead and zinc.

Every member of our union 
A has a right to ask this ques-

tion with impatience. It is

V now a year and a half-since« .
>1_ea-<3; ‘a'nd“"zinc" began to nose.

dive with considerable unem-
ployment, and almost a year
since the danger» signs first
appeared in copper.

And yet, nothing concrete ‘
has been accomplished. There-pp
‘ have been many moves, . but
none producing results.
_ flurry of excitement and antic-

The

ipation of concrete‘ steps 1' to
be taken _to save our industry
have come to naught. All the

hearings, all the speech mak-

ing, all the promises wound
up with the legislative branch
of the government passing the
buck back to Ike. A long four-
months after Congress , ad-
journed in 1957, the Tariff

commission finally held hear- ’

ings. Meanwhile, conditions in
our industry got worse
rapidly. All of us hoped that
the Tariff commission would
give some answer in solving
this problem. Mine-Mill threw
all of its resources into mak-

ing a good case for our in-

dustry and our four national
officers were on the scene in
Washington to see that this
presentation got the ear of
the Tariff commissioners.
NOTHING HAPPENED *
-Again,-for six long months,
nothing happened. Unemploy-
ment went from bad to worse
in lead ‘and zinc and then the

copper layoffs began. Finally,

in April of this year, the
Tariff commission -did report,

but the commissioners were_

split down the middle, 3-3.
More important than this was
the fact that what they of-

fered was too little and un-'

realistic. Our officers and
many of our members who
followed the Tariff commis-
sion‘ report must have known
immediately that such a re-

’ port never would be approved

by President Eisenhower.

For our part, we pushed. .

before both Congress and
Ike our plan for quotas
which we believed to be the
logical proposition which
would maintain friendly re-
lationships with other coun-
tries, and yet provide a
measure of‘ protection for
our industry and, most im-
portant, some security for

our own miners" and smelter-
men. The industry, of
course, has never joined us
in this approach of quotas
based on wage scales of

_ foreign countries. Instead it »

has pushed for the proposi-
tion of Congressional legisla-

cal Trades agreements to
provide for import ,tax of
,four cents on our three ma-
jor metals and “peril point”
(at which point these taxes
would be imposed) of 30
cents for copper, 17 cents
~ for lead and 14 cents for
(zinc. But, as we go to press,
the House Ways and Means
‘Committee has rejected in-

dustry’s proposition. Only a -

-miracle could change this

_ situation on the floor of the

House. '

So we are vworse off than '

where we started a year ago.
All stockpiling has stopped
and, in addition, the general
state of the economy has put
our industry in an even worse
situation than before. _

, In the meantime,‘ the admin-
istration, through Interior
Secretary Seaton, has pro-
posed a, modified subsidy plan
for the minerals of our in-
dustry. This idea, which for
years was labelled by Repub-
licans as ,“New Dealism,”
“Socialism,” and “Government
Interference,” calls for stabi-
lized prices of copper at 27%
centsjlead at 14% cents and

Z zinc at 12% cents. The theory

is that _the government would

pick up the tab for each com-

pany on the difference be-
tween these prices and the
going market price if itwere

‘ less than the stabilized -prices

mentioned above.

. MAJOR HURDLE

No one yet knows what

merit, if any, this plan will .

have at this writing. Secre-
tary Seaton yet has to deliver

to Congress and the people his.

legislative_ and administrative
proposals to put such a plan
into_ effect. Our officers will

i then have to take a good look

at it to see what positionour
union and its members will
want to take. Even assuming
that the Seaton plan would
have some merit, there is still
the major hurdle of getting an
economy-minded Congress to
appropriate hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars to make such
a plan work. ‘

Which brings to mind the
thought that the best way to
correct this situation is on
election day. Don’t forget No-

sImportPla-ni
Is Realistic — Pezzatiﬁ

MRS. ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, whose views
are always worth listening to, held a press
conference in Denver recently and was asked
about tariffs on foreign metal ores. She was
quoted as replying:

“I don’t blame the
men in the mining indus-
try who are losing their
jobs asking for protec-
tion, but the government
has an obligation to take
a broader view.”

What the “broader
view” might be, the for-
mer First Lady did not
specify. But she did go
on to say that the _
United States govern- ' ,_ q ,, _ —.
ment should encourage Latin American unions
to raise wages and living standards so as 1’ to
be more competitive with this country’s- pro-_ =:*e.j:
ducers. We are certainly all for that. . -  

As a matter of fact, our union’s proposal 
for import quotas was based on favored tre'_a‘*t-; 
ment for foreign countries with the highest‘: 
wages. This is a realistic approach which would 
help to prevent the undermining of American , ” 
wage standards and, at the same time, woilldff 
tie in with Mrs. Roosevelt’s advice. It would."
encourage unions in other countries to press ﬁg;
for higher wages in order to get a biggergi
share of the American market for the product-j,
of. their labor. ?  ~ *-

-Unions Beat Phone
ill Hike in Montana

: : HELENA, Mont.——Mine-Mill and labor generally in
this state scored a tremendous victory for all utility
:;,con‘sumers May 7 when the Montana Public Service com-
mission, by a 2 to 1 “historic decision,” denied telephone

Mountain States Telephone
& Telegraph company.

The MST&T application
would have increased resi-
dence telephone rates by from‘
25 to 58 per cent and business
rates by from 15 to 35 per
cent. Commission Chairman
Paul T. Smith and Commis-
sioner Ory J. Armstrong voted
to deny the rate increases, rul-
ing that the utility's present
rates are adequate and that no
increase was necessary. Com-
missioner Austin B. Middleton
dissented from the majority
decision.
1'1-DAY HEARING

The Public Service commis-
sion held 11 days of hearings
on the company’s rate -in-
crease request. C. J.’I-Iansen,
commission counsel, said they
were the most extensive rate
proceedings ever ‘conducted by
that body. Presented for the
record were 100 exhibitsiand

. 1,303 pages of testimony.

‘-Mine-Mill s in ' Montana

1 spearheaded the fight, along

with the state AFL-CIO, the

0 Railroad Brotherhoods and

the Montana Farmers union.

These groups tog e t 11' e r

formed the - Utility ‘Users
Protest league, which re- ‘
tained Dr, 7 Laurence S. "

Knappen, Washington, D. C.,

 "utility rate expert, to tes-

tify on aspects ‘of the‘ util-
.ity’s financial structure and
Helena attorney William
Leaphart, Jr., to handle the -
legal end of -the case.
‘Hailing the commission’s de-
cision, Mine-Mill Board Mem-
ber Ernest Salvas of District 1
said that it “justified our ex-
penditures toward the joint
-protestants’ program of pre-
venting increased telephone
rates.” He pointed _ out that
Mine-Mi1l’s total‘ contribution
in these utility rate fights to
date amounts to $3,738, “in
addition to the time, effort and
participation by International
and local union leaders.”
LESSON
Success of the fight, Salvas
said, “illustrates the need for
having experts present testi-
mony and prepare evidence in
‘utility rate cases.” .
Executive President James
Umber of the Montana AFL-
CIO attributed’ the victory
to the “efforts of organized
labor,” . adding that “the .
contributions of a lot of lit-
tle people -made it possible -

-D for us to hire a competent

rate expert.” He estimated .
“that organized labor’s ‘ef-
forts saved Montana tele- -
phone users about $3‘/2 mil-

~ lion.

’ "D Salvas also’ called attention»
to the Montana Power com-
pany’s pending request for
electricity rate increases,‘ and
said Mine-Mill hopes “that
Commissioners Smith and
‘Armstrong will apply the same
principle they used. for deny-
ing the telephone increase ‘ to
the Montana Power case.”

Metcalf’s - Battle for Better  
Schools Pains Republicans

WASHINGTON, D._C.—-
What Mine-Mill members al-

"ready know about Congress-

man Lee Metcalf as a fighter
for the people was brought to

' the attention of the Whole na-

tion last month in the widely
syndicated ‘column of Drew
Pearson’s “Washington Merry-
Go-Round.”

Pearson devoted almost
the entire space of his May
5 column to describe the
fight led by the Montana
Democrat in winning ap-
proval "of the old * -Eisen-
hower school aid --bill by-the :-
House Education and La-

‘bor committee on which

Metcalf serves. The bill, pro-“

posed by the President last _

year, has been ignored by
committee Republicans ever
since . .. . until, that is, Met-
calf’s move forced them to
acceptit. _

The nationally syndicated
Washington columnist report-
ed that .Metcalf was accused
by Rep. Peter Frelinghuysen,
Jr. (R., N. J.), of “engaging in
a clever maneuver obviously
designed to embarrass the
President and put Republicans

on the spot,” since Eisenhower,

didn’t include the school aid
measure in his legislative pro-
gram this year.
PERFECT ANSWER

When Metcalf pointed out
that the Republicans were
only being given “a chance to
back up what the President re-
quested,” F-relinghuysen _re-
torted that “the gentlerrian
was “just

-A REP. LEE METCALF
(D., MONT.) -

to Pearson,‘ Metcalf Vansweredzl

, “The only politics I am play-
ing is to try to ‘get out a

school bill to answer the cry-
ing need for more classrooms.

"On Frelinghuysen’s argu-
ment that Eisenhower hadn't

V resubmitted his school aid pro-

posal for action now, Pearson
quoted Metcalf as countering:
“Maybe not, but I feel
Congress should do some-
thing for our schools,
whether or not the President
has seen fit to reinclude it
in his budget. . . . This is the
exact bill Ike sent to Con-
gress, and we’re giving him
and the Republican mem-
bers of Congress an oppor-
tunity to prove that they
meant what they said when
they said they were for fed-
eral aid to schools.” .
Pearson reported that the

 

closed-door committee session
then recorded a 3 to 3 tie vote
along party lines which was
broken in favor of approval by

Democratic Committee Chair-

man Cleveland Bailey of West
Virginia.
MORE RECOGNITION
Another Washington colum-
nist, George Dixon of the
Washington Post and Times
Herald, also noted Metcalf’s
talent in a somewhat different
field-—writing. Metcalf, he
said, appeared to be “doodling"
on a piece of paper during a

recent hearing on space and
satellite problems.

Left be-
hind at Metcalf's desk after

«the hearing was this “doodled" -

verse: - -
Big satellites» have little sat-
ellites

And smaller satellites to

guide ’em.,
While smaller satellites have
little satellites -
And so ad infinitum.
‘Besides these two instances

noted by newspaper colum- I J
nists of Metcalf’s interest in,‘
federal aid to education and

space problems, the young
congressman is well known
in Montana as
Mine-Mill in Montana and na-
tionally, especially in the fight
for relief of the metals’ crisis
and for federal mine safety

and health legislation to end J

the scourge of silicosis.

In his current bid for re-
election to a fourth term in
Congress, Metcalf has also
made opposition to a proposed

Labor Board Tough on Unions

WASHINGTON, D. C.——Re-

‘ fusal last m o n t h of the Na-

tional Labor Relations Board
to set aside an election in the
South despite the company’s
use of race prejudice against
a union points upthe extent
to which the board more and
more is leaning toward the in-
terests of employers under the
Eisenhower administration.
The NLRB let stand a 40 to

"8 vote against the AFL-CIO ,

Textile Workers at the Shar-
ney I-Iosiery mills in Madison,
N. C., despite the union’s
charge that management

. created an atmosphere of hate

and bias against the union by
circulating a letter accusing

the TWU_A of aiming to elimi- '

nate racial segregation.

- VICTORIES DOWN ,
This and other -instance of-
the Republica‘-n-packed
NLRB’s interpretations. of the .
I Taft-Hartley law go -.a lo n g
way , toward explaining why _

union victories in ‘bargaining

. represenfation elections ,_ C and

the number of workers for

.r,

whom bargaining agents were
chosen have beenireduced sig-
nificantly since President Eis-
enhower began appointing re-
placements to the L a b o r
Board. _

The board’s own statistics
show ‘that ’ in 1950 unions
won 73 percent of elections
against “No Union” when
the majority of the Board
w a s Democratic-appointed.
These 4223 elections brought
759,033 under union repre-
sentation. By 1957 the num-
ber of elections won by
unions had dropped to a new
low of "2988, or 61 percent,
involving 269,050 workers.

There is no doubt that many
decisions handed down by the
Eisenhower-s e 1 e c t e d board
during the last five Yiears, fa-
voring as they do the position
of employers, make up one of
the main reasons why organi-
zation has become tougher for.
labor. '

weapons granted employers
by the board was its interpre-

Many Changes Being Planned
For 1958-1959 Television Season

HERE we are again at the time of year
when TV show sponsors take agonizing in-
inventory of what programs to put their
money on, when the fate of last year’s TV
stars hang in balance, andiwhen the net-
works make with announcements of multimil-

lion dollar deals for what you’ll see during the
1958-59 video season.

\Now this, admittedly, may not be as
world-shaking as politics in France, Nixon in
Venezuela or satellites in space. It is, how-
ever, relative to the fact that “Gunsmoke” con-
tinues to rate tops with viewers in more than
41 million American homes having TV sets.
And who will say that 41,000,000 American
homes can be wrong? .

For this column, then, the good news
last month was that NBC signed old “Mr.
Television” himself, Milton Berle, to star
in a regular weekly half-hour show be-
ginning this fall. Kraft Foods dropped its
Kraft Television theater to replace it with
“Uncle Milty’s” comedy-variety show.

Berle, as anyone with a three-year-old TV
set knows, was one of the first top comedians
to fall a casualty to the ratings, along with
such erstwhile stars as Red Buttons and Jackie
Gleason. Now Buttons, having scored a hit in
another medium (an Oscar-winning role in the
movie “Sayonara”) is also making a big come-
back on TV. Whether or not Gleason comes
back appears to be of little concern to Gleason,

‘since under his long-range contract with CBS

he draws $5,000 a week from the network with-
out going anywhere near a TV camera. ’

Fan Tales

Some Sports Writers
See Fan as a Villain

DENVER——It has been our fervent wish for som’
time that sports writers in minor league baseball tow
would quit assuming the role of press agents for the loca
front offices. In more cases than is seemly you’ll‘_fi,_rI1i
that the local baseball writers feel they have been chose,
by whatever gods the minor league owners worship to say
the home town management from the wrath of the fans. 

Lately we’ve been following such a typewriter crusade
the American Association and the Pacific Coast League. 
time someone so much as suggests that maybe the ma}
leagues should expand in one form or another, the owners;
the Sunnyside Falcons, or whatever the particular minor le
team is called, seem to go out of their money-grubbing’ mi '

This is especially true when a current minor league
town such as Denver, Houston, Minneapolis, Omaha, *or'

Dallas is mentioned as a major league possibility. 

someone say, for example, that the major leagues.
should expand to 10 teams each, and the first reflex
of the local farm club press agent is to pick up the

phone and call the nearest sports editor. 9 ' *

West? Coast, was exhibiting progress and enterprise:

Lane cried out for a ‘A10-team American League.” _

It seems that. Lane mentioned a few possible additiow ,
towns. for ...what~'c1iche-loving sports writers call “the >J'.uf1,i'
circuit.” To the Denversports writer this meant that /‘fallhe

NAACP Branches
Mark Decision Day

WASHINGTON, D. C.——May 17, set
aside by the last Mine-Mill convention as
“Decision-Day” to mark the fourth anni-
versary of the Supreme Court’s ruling that
public school segregation is unconstitution-
al, was observed last month by branches of
the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People throughout the nation.

It was observed by many Mine-Mill locals .

as well.

It was also observed in another way a bit
earlier in a statement issued by the Anti-
Defamation ‘League of the B’nai B’rith and
entered into the Congressional Record by
Congressman Emanuel Celler (D., N. Y.).

The statement pointed out that the league
had “placed before U. S. Attorney General
William P. Rogers a record of 45 bombing
outrages that have occurred in the South
since January 1, 1957. This record showed,
the statement said, “that the Federal authori-
ties do have jurisdiction in the matter and
that Federal action is evidently needed.”

. It appealed for federal intervention “to pre- '
vent further bombing outrages.” These bomb- -

ings, the statement charged, are part of a

‘ conspiracy whose purpose “is to intimidate its
‘ victims into abandoning their federally secured

rights to vote, to freedom of assembly and to
freedom of religion.” It-called for action by

” the Department of Justice.

HOWARD LISTED

As reproduced in the Congressional Record
of May 5, the “Bombings of Religious Institu-
tions, Schools, and Other Property” lists as
number 19 the following: A

“April 29, 1957, Bessemer, Ala.: Explosion
at the home of Asbury Howard, a Negro and
international vice president of the Mine, Mill

and Smelter Workers.” V I
_The Senate Judiciary Committee, mean-

_ while, last month approved the appointment of
Gordon M. Tiffany as staff director. of the new ‘

Civil Rights commission, despite ‘Southern ob-

jjection. At the same time ‘a subcommittee of“
the same body killed chances-for any improve-

ment in civil rights legislation this year.

-The Senate Constitutional Rights .Subcom-
mittee May 5 ruled out hearings on a number
ofcivil rights ‘bills which had been referred to
‘the. subcommittee." One of -- the pending bills

,would use the Department of Health, Educa-
— tion and Welfareto try to solve school inte-
- gration problems before they reach the courts.
Another offers, a modified version of the sec-

tion eliminated from last year’s- bill permit-

« ting the government to obtain injunctions: to _
v protect all civil rights.

Subcommittee chairman Thomas C. Hen-

S nings (D., Mo.), -who had» previously an- v

nounced hearings would be held on the bills,
.was overruled by a three to two combination

vote of Republicans‘ and Southern Demo-

crats whose position was that civil rights
bills had no chance to pass in Congress this
year. ' » i A '

" Senate leaders have clearly indicated they
prefer to avoid a civil rights fight with elec-
tions coming up. The Eisenhower~’administr.a-
tion has also announced it is sending no civil
rights legislation to Congress, this year.

never had. any such spy organizations as we

have in this country today.” ,
, Mr.»-Eaton’s outspoken criticism hit a nerve.
Retailiating swiftly, the House un-American

Activities committee subpoenaed .him with ‘an

attack on his "public utterances.” .Mr. Eaton"s

answer was swift, too.‘ , i . j V H ‘
V --“Needless to add,”vhe said, “I shall, be de-

- lighted to appear -‘before-;;-any‘ Congressional
committee for afserious -dis_cu.SS.i_o,n.?’of the Fed-
-eral secret police and intelligence agencies and

the effects, “as I see them, of_ their sub rosa
activities on the freedom guaranteed to the
citizens by the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights. . ' '

“In the‘ name of national security these

secret police and intelligence agencies carry on ,

their operations in a cloak-and-dagger at-

-mosphere of complete secrecy, and claim abso-

lute immunity from the scrutiny of the public
for whom they profess to act. '

“The charge that anyone who challenges
them is ‘giving aid and comfort to the enemy’
is the familiar but threadbare line that is con-
stantly employed to -throttle the traditional.

fathers of this republic‘ were willing to lay

PROBLEM

The problem is to find every
person with active tubercu-
losis infection, and keep him
from spreading, the disease,
which requires the proper
treatment until he is well,
with regular’ checkups later
to see that he stays well.

How big is the problem?
Very big. says the Tuberculosis

authorities‘ and other physi-
cians dealing with it. ,
Although tuberculosis is “no
longer the leading_ killer — it’s
dropped from first place to
tenth as V a ‘cause of . death
since the early 1900s—it re-
mains. a . major cause of ill-
ness. The Tuberculosis asso-
ciation estimates 100,000 new
infections each year. -
_Each of these people may
infect any number of others.
Among the difficulties yet to
be overcome in breaking this
chain of infection:

TRICKY
There are no symptoms at

It's common to have tubercu-
losis without knowing it——the
estimate is a third of the
people who have it are un-

ceiving no treatment. .

-In the meantime the germs
spread toothers. They usually.
go from one person to the’

newspapers minimized all the

declared: “Of course,-not!”_
“The results," the paper
said, “might befar more ‘harm-
ful; for once newspaper read-

gine that the situation was‘

far worse than it really was.”

Same As Usual
Despite the recession, divi-
dends are acting the same as
usual, in fact better. Corpora-
tions are paying more divi-
dends this year than they did
in 1957, according to their own
published reports. Total paid
for the first quarter‘ of 1958
was $2,800,000,000 (be sure to
count all those ‘zeroes, broth-
er). That was $14 million
more cash dividends than the
investors got during the same
period last year. As we’ve al-

Slump Hits
Negro With

cent analysis -by the New York

State Commission -A g-a in s t
_ Discrimination shows that the
_present economic recession is
hitting Negroes twice as hard

as white workers.

' The commission's chairman,

A Charles Abrams, -said that one

out of every seven Ne gr 0

is now unemployed. In con-
trast tothis, he said, the ratio
of ‘ unemployment a m o n g

every‘ 14. » i .

“ in Abrams commented on the
commission’s analysis of .11
‘years of .national unemploy-
,ment statistics, pointing to

economic distress on Negro
Workers. ‘
SOME FACTORS _

He said Negroes are more
subject to mass layoffs be-
cause of their concentration
in " ’ wage-earning groups. In
addition, he said, they are em-
ployed mainly in unorganized
industries where there is less

- job security, and that even in
industries ,where they are
members of-unions they have
low seniority and thus among
the first to be laid off. “

‘ Furthermore, Ab r am s‘

‘nity for education‘-‘and train-
faced with a poorer choice

‘ crimination as a major fac- -
tor ‘in the unemployment
. picture. ~ ‘

In the commission chair-

I enhower’s Committee on Gov-
_ ernment contracts “must be
made more effective in pro-
tecting the Negro and his op-
portunities on a national ba-
sis.” .
AGENCY NEEDED
He said it is. an “urgent ne-
cessity” that a federal agency
be created to handle all phases
of minority employment prob-
lems. Such an agency, Abrams
proposed, ‘should promote the
qualification of Negroes- for
better job opportunities and
work to eliminate obstacles to
their advancement, through
education and training.
He said the recession is wip-
ing out many gains made by

Negroes -in. the last‘ ten years.

 INDUSTRY NOTS 

A-Bombs, Cutbacks
And Profits in News

A-BOMB set off underground at Nevada nuclear test site

 

recently blasted 700,000 tons of rock. -Tests showed about one-

tenth of one percent of rock was radioactive-;~—only small amount
closest to blast. Rest of rock broken was free of radioactivity.

Important copper producer is now reported planning to ex-
periment with a-blasting of large, low grade deposit. Experi-
ments, if successful, could point way to development of im-
portant new properties.

Magma Copper, is cashing in on contract negotiated in 1952

with Defense Materials Procurement Agency. Government buys -

San Manuel’s copper at 27.05 cents per pound, compared with
major producers’ price of 25 cents and custom smelters’ 23%.
cents. Contract to buy has -three more years to run, has esca-
lator clause that has already added over 3 cents to floor price
since deal was ‘closed.

I C
Price Cut TWICE -

COPPER TUBING price was cut twice during past month
by U. S. fabricators. Combined cuts lopped 18% percent - off
former prices. In each case lead in cutting prices was taken by
Revere Copper and Brass, 35.82 .percent owned by American
Smelting and Refining Co. Fabricating subsidiaries of Anacon-
da, Kennecott and Phelps Dodge followed‘ suit. Imported seam-
less copper tubing has been underselling U. S. product, last year
captured over 90 percent of American market. Price cuts are
aimed at recapturing this ‘market for U. S. fabricators. Big ques-
tion is, why did industry‘ wait so long before moving to meet
foreign competition? ' ‘

New Plant

ALUMINUM capacity took another big jump in May with"

opening of first furnace -line at $110-million aluminum plant of
Ormet Corporation on Ohio river. Ormet is susidiary of Revere
Copper and Brass and Olin-Mathieson Chemical Corporation,
which will absorb its output. Plant when in full operation will

' be second largest in country, produce 180,000 tons per year. ‘This

will make Ormet country.’s fourth largest aluminum producer.
Added, capacity, on top of aluminum price cut reported last
month and slow sales of aluminum, will spur industry to seek

metals. 

Hot Spot 7 -    —

MAGMA copper minéat Superior, Ariz., long has been rated
as one of the world’s'hottest (perhapsthe hottest)"in the world.
Rocktemperatures underground reach 159 degrees" at 4,800 feet.
Underground temperatures at Magma rise 1.27 degrees for every
100 feet of depth. In early days of mine, heat problem was not
serious, but as shafts went deeper, itmade working conditions

"new uses for white metal in competition with copper, other

unbearable. To getat ores at greater ‘depths—Magma produces ,

highest grade ore in Arizona—refrigerated air conditioning ‘sys-

tem was installed in-(mine in 1930’-s, now includes 300,000 gallon I

water storage tank, -30 railroad carloads of pipe and ‘fittings.
Temperatures in stopes are now reported held to 80's and 90’s.

Lead and Zinc

LEAD PRICE dropped to 11%c last month. Cut was forced
by offersjof imported lead at less than U. S. producers’ price.
Spread between London and New York prices continues, and
there is no guarantee that undercutting will not-continue, force
further cuts. ' -

ZINC is still steady at 10c as we go to press, but price is
also under pressure, from imports brought over from London,
duty paid at 1/2 to 3/1. cents less than U. S. producers price.

Cutbacks M

POTASH COMPANY OF AMERICA, according to F. 0.
Davis, executive vice president, is planning to cut back produc-
tion at" Carlsbad, N._ M., mine from 600,000 tons annually to
200,000 tons, shift production to new mine in Saskatchewan,

Canada, where operations are expected to reach output of 600,000 0

tons‘ per year. Tax concessions for first five years, plus many
new labor saving vdevices-Eat new installation, have encouraged

“shift, according to Davis."International Minerals and Chemicals, _

the other U. S. potash producer, now developing mine in Sas-
katchewan field, has announced no plans to shift operations out

of Carlsbad to the new property as yet. IMCC says it looks to

increasing ii-ndustrial use of potash as well -as to expanded farm

. . use to keep -both operations going. IMCC is only potash producer

which processes product in industrial applications.
4 * * . * . . . .
CUTBACKS in lead and zinc and copper continue to make

f news. Miami-Copper announced‘ it would shut down for vacations

for month of July, rather than scheduling staggered vacations;
company recently went on short work week. St. Joe Lead’s
3-week shutdown in March took 6,000 tons of lead off the mar-
ket, say company officials. They add that mine work force in
Missouri has been reduced 10 percent compared with year ago.
New Jersey Zinc closed mine at Hanover, N. M.,‘on May 1. About
75 workers -were affected. Company's roasting plant at Canon
City, Colo., closed May 15, idling 40. Company also announced
layoffs at smelters in Palmerton, Pa., -and Depue, Ill., which 11:

- said would affect hundreds of long-time employees, many of

whom have 20 years’- seniority or more. New Jersey Zinc’s mine
and mill at Gilman, Colo., are still in full operation but a com-
pany spokesman was quoted as saying a shutdown “seems to be
in the cards.” Shutdown at Gilman would idle 525.

Chilean Strikes

STRIKE at Anaconda Company copper mine in Chile was
settled after seven-week deadlock. Settlement gave workers a
wage increase, details of which are lacking as we go to press.
Talks between union and management at Kennecott’s Braden
mine in Chile have started, as present contract is about to run
out. Settlement at Anaconda is expected to set pattern for new
contract at Braden.——A.W.S. .

Study Sees
Chill from

Canadians

WASHINGTON, D. C.
—“Erosipn” of relations be-
tween the United States and
Canada is deplored in a report
of the House -Foreign Affairs
committee W r i t t e n by Con-
gressmen Brooks Hays (D.,
Ark.) and Frank M. Coffin
(D., Me.)

Both countries should take
steps to stop “the erosion in
their traditionally excellent
relationships,” the report re-
leased May 5, said.
STRAINS INCREASE M

The congressmen said that
during the past few years, the
traditional U. S.-Canadian
friendship “has been subjected
to ever—increasing strains, and

there has been a rising tide of .
resentment against the United .
States on the other side of the ‘

border.”

“This resentment,” they C
said, “Is apparent on every ‘

side” to visitors from this

country to Canada—“in con- '

versations with private citi-4 "

zens, with government offi- .
cials, and in the press.” The‘
report added. that the ‘main
reason for this is “the ., lack
in the United States ‘of un-
derstanding and knowledge
of Canada’s ‘proud heritage,
its economic and political
problems and its special re-
lationships with the United
Kingdom.” a 3 .
“Even worse,” it continued,
“it appears to our Canadian
cousins that Americans do not
desire to learn anything more
concerning Canada and its
problems.” ' '
PRESS HIT ,  V
The press on both sides of
the border was criticized in
the report which pointed out
that only the New York Times
and Chicago Tribune have cor-
respondents in Canada. This
gives Canadians the impres-
sion that people on this side
of the line “are not particular-

‘ ly interested in what goes on

toward the north,” the report
said.

The congressmen noted that
a number of economic and
political problems‘ present “a
constant source of friction.”
These include, the report said,

.U. S. surplus farm disposal

programs, American oil im-
port quotas, threats of metal
and tariff increases, the “unfa-
vorable balance of trade with
the U. S., and worries over the
possible effects of overwhelm-
ingly large U. S. investments
in the Canadian economy.”

Canadian Labor Congress  

(From Mine-Mill Herald)

VVINNIPEG—Since .-the last ledition’ of '

our paper the -Canadian Labour Congress
has held its Second Constituti_on'al Conven-

- tion in the City of Winnipeg, and, as was 
- to be expected, the major problems of
‘unemployment, trade and world peace dom-

inated the issues on the convention. floor.

~ The CLC is-, the Canadian counterpart of“

the ‘AFL-CIO. _ .- ,. . -

_ The proceedings of the Congress were fully
reported in the press at the time; and We will
not attempt to go into them in detail.

To combat unemployment, a program of
expanded trade, increased public works, tax
reductions and increases in unemployment
insurance, old age pensions and family allow-
ances was proposed by the Economic Policy
committee. The government was called upon
to budget for deficits as long as the recession
.lasts.

' Processing of Canadian, raw materials in

Canada,’ efforts toward the “fullest_ possible-

trade with all countries consistent with na-
tional security,” and higher. wages to increase
purchasing power were all adopted as steps to
combat unemployment. 0 ‘ .

The ‘violation of Canadian sovereignty by
the Ford Motor Co. in the case of the 1,000
cars was condemned, and the government was
asked to investigate the sending of trade mis-
sions t0_China and other Communist countries,
including business men, civil ‘ servants“ and
trade unionists. '
Jodoin on Peace ’ _

The following excerpt is from the report of
President Claude J odoin:

“Unless mankind can find a solution for
the pressing economic and social problems
which face the majority of the world’s peo-
ple, there can be no hope for lasting peace.

“We may believe that recent scientific
breakthroughs in the field of outer space
travel and thermonuclear physics open un-
dreamed of possibilities for the human race,
but they also contain the danger of man’s
self-destruction unless agreement can be
reached on disarmament and the foundation
laid for a world of peace. The very existence
of our civilization depends on peace. In the
era of hydrogen and atomic bombs the possi-
bility of war is too grim even to contem-
plate.” , V .

Political Action _ . .

No doubt the , overwhelming victory of the
Tories in the last election caused serious think-
ing as to how the-aspirations and 'needs_‘of the
people of Canada can be met in the political
field. As a result the Congress departed from
the long standing position of both the CCL and
the TLC and brought in a resolution for the
formation of a new political party or political

organization which would embrace the work- _

ers, farmers and other like groups. -

The resolution to the convention reads in
part as follows: _

“This convention, therefore, instructs the
Executive Council to give urgent and imme-
diate attention to this matter by initiating
discussions with the CCF, interested farm
organizations and other like-minded indiv-
uals and groups, to formulate a constitution’
and a program for such a. political instru-
ment of the Canadian people ; and to report
on such "a plan, draft constitution and pro-
gram to the next convention of this Congress
for action.”

If this -new organization receives the whole-
hearted support and direction of the Congress
it can become one of the greatest advances of
the working people in the history of Canada.

' \

Labor: Unity . ' , 1 .
-The subject of , labor unity received more

discussion on a_nd_ off the floor of the[conven-

tion than any other’ matter. The‘, resol‘utions,

without, exception, demanded’ theentry into the

Attack Veto Powers-

Many of the delegates who spoke ‘on the
floor urged the convention and the Congress
officers to find ways and means of removing
from the CLC Constitution the power of one
individual union to veto the admission of an-

‘ other union;

Certainly the feeling of the delegates is
that the road should .be opened as widely -as

' possible to assure the completeunity of the

entire trade union movement in Canada. The
officers of Congress cannot help but be im-

. pressed and encouraged by the sentiments

expressed by the delegates from all over the
country and if the wishes of the rank and
file are to be given, full’ meaning and expres-
sion, by the time the next Canadian Labor
Congress convention rolls around, the entire
Canadian trade union movement should be
completely united.—WILLIAM KENNEDY, '
Mine-Mill Canadian vicepresident. '

hours in April, shortest
since 1940. In copper min-
ing, for example, there have
been a number of cutbacks
to a fouuday week.

2. Personal income statis-
tics for April showed a small
upturn, the first since August,
1957, but this, it turns out,
was due in main to increased
government payments—social
security, unemployment com-
pensation, and veterans bene-
fits. Wag e s and salary pay-

* ments, a more accurate indi-

cator of the rate of production
and employment, continued to
fall.

3; Industrial produc-
tion, as measured by the Fed-
eral Reserve board, fell in
April for the eighth consecu-
tive month. It has already de-

clined proportionately more

than the total dropsin indus-
trial production in the reces-
sions of 1949-50 or 1953-54-
and hasn't hit bottom yet. The
index shows the broad picture
in all_industry; individual
key industries like steel have
been running at less than one-
half of capacity; autos are in
such rough shape the industry
is expected to shut down three

. months early this summer to

get ready for the 1959 model
changeover. A new survey by
the National Industrial Con-
ference board points to a de-
cline in spending by manufac-
turers on plant expansion
through 1958, and on into 1959
as well.

PRICES CLIMB

The most unusual‘ feature
of the depression of 1957-58 is
the behavior of prices, which
ordinarily fall when times are
bad. But this time, as produc-
tion, employment, p a y r 0 ll s

have pointed downward sharp-«

ly, consumer prices have in-
creased on the average by
about three per cent;

The cost-of-living index
for April hit a new all-time
high, as did fo od prices,
rents and the costs of medi-
cal care. Wholesale prices of
manufactured articles have
also held steady, in some
cases advancing, while raw
materials and many crude
foodstuffs h a v e declined.
Retail prices of such manu-
factured goods as automo-
biles, appliances have soft-
ened, but this often repre-
sents a cut in the retailers’
profit margin, rather than a

monopoly control somewhere

two years ago, few workers
were penalized or discharged,
except in cases of excessive
absenteeism in which the em-
ployee made no effort to cor-
rect the situation. In the case
of the Ray division, for
example, a specific agreement
was reached which provided
penalties only in the event of
excessive and unexcused ab-
sences.

DR-AFTS RULES
Within the past two years,

however, in Nevada, Arizona,’

and New Mexico, the company
has drafted absentee rules
without consulting or negotiat-
ing with the union. About
these rules, Board Member
Skinner said:

“By making it very dif-
ficult for the employee to
get an excused absence, the
company’s new rules change

guaranteed under the contract.

to one where everyone can
be penalized if they are un-
able to follow all of the
complicated requirements
for reporting off work. As
the absentee penalties grew

in each division, the Ken- _,
necott council’ decided to
challenge the company's
right to establish such rules
and in many cases estab-
lish them in conflict with
the terms of the agreement.
This should be an extremely
important case to many of
the local unions and to the
International Union because
more and more many of the

companies in our industry
are getting tougher on such
company rules as those on
absenteeism.”

Skinner, who is Kennecott
co-ordinator, said that "the
union’s position is that the
absenteeism question correctly
belongs at the -bargaining
table and that the’ company
cannot establish their own
rules negating the protection

‘STALLED

Government measures to re-
verse the downward course of
the worst depression since the
1930’s have been stalled since
the first of the year. Although
more than half a million job-
less have exhausted unemploy-
ment compensation benefits, a
weak Administration bill to
allow each state to increase its
benefit period by up to 50 per
cent with no increase in bene-
fit payments has been watered
down in the House, and at
this writing, apparently will
pass the Senate as_well. U. S.
Senator Paul Douglas (D-Ill.)
calls the bill a “gigantic hoax”
on the unemployed.

A much needed tax out,
which most economists say
is essential and long over-
dueas an anti-recession
measure is bottled up by
agreement b e t W e e n the
Treasury Department and
Congressional leaders. Indi-

cations are that powerful ’

forces in the Administration
will resist a cut in taxes
paid by wage earners, which

jobs. If auto shutdowns come
in July, the employment pic-
ture will continue bad through
the summer at least._ Many of
the best . informed business
analysts» think this depression
will last a long time. The Wall

Street bank, Guaranty Trust ’

company, says for "example:
“In 1954 «and in other past
instances, the tempo of decline
eased well in advance -of the
final trough, and there might
well be a repetition of such a
pattern this time. In the in-
terim, the unemployment total
could rise considerably-——per-
haps to the six-million mark.”
Or, to quote Sylvia Porter,
nationally syndicated financial
writer, “If you "accept at face
value the official pronounce-
ments being pumped out of
Washington day after day,
you easily might get the im-
pression that 1) we’ve- hit bot-
tom, and 2) now we're going
to bounce off it and go mer-
rily up again. But even if we
are beginning to probe for the
low, we are not g oin‘g' to

The Illin oi s Business Re-
view, published’ by the-‘Bureau
of Economic and Business-‘ Re-
search, University aof Illinois,
says, “Essentially, the govern-
ment forces are still marking
time. . . . The hard fact is that
the situation has continued to
deteriorate. Ther e is very
little prospect that the decline
will cease before the middle of
1959.”

The duration and severity of
the depression d e p e n d s in
large measure upon Congres-
sional action in the next six
w e e k s or two months. The
right kind of a tax cut, a de-
cent unemployment compensa-
tion extension bill, an ade-
quate bill for relief and re-
construction ’ in d e p r e s se d
areas, public h o u sin g and
school construction programs,
all together, will get us back
on the track. But the record of
this session so far amply
demonstrates ~ t h a t Congress
won't act unless it hears clear
and strong and loud from the
people back home.

Their fight for
quotas or higher tariffs, as
part of the Trade Agree-
ments Act, will most likely
now shift to the Senate, where
their political strength is
relatively "stronger.

6. The Administration, as an
apparent alternative to both
quotas and higher tariffs,

pushed its own subsidy bill.

Interior Secretary Fred Sea-
ton, on May 22 finally sent
to the Senate a draft bill em-
bodying the subsidy plan for
five minerals — including
copper, lead and zinc —-— that
he first outlined before the
Senate _- Interior Subcommit-
tee on Mineral Policy on
April 28. The bill includes

"several, features that were

not mentioned in his previous
testimony before the com-
mittee.
The Season bill would pay
, domestic producers, for five
years, the difference be-
tween the market price and

the “stabilization price” on—_

annual _‘ production not in
_excess“j'ofi 1,000,000 tons of
‘ “copper, 350,000 tons of lead
and ‘550,000 tons of zinc.
- (The bill- also covers tung-
sten and fluorspar). The
“stabilization p r i c e s” for

1 these particular metals

would be — copper, 271/;
cents per pound; lead, 14%
cents; zinc,-12% -cents. '
SETS LIMITS
The‘ bill would restrict price-
cutting by setting limits on
payments; the maximum pay-
ments would be 31/2 cents for

copper, 3% cents for lead, and’

2% cents for zinc, thus——in ef-
fect—setting “ﬂoor prices" of
24 cents, 11% cents, and 10%.
cents ‘for copper, lead and zinc,
respectively. ,
The annual limitations on
production would be broken
down into quarterly quotas;
whenever sales for any quarter
exceeded the quota for that
period, payments would be
“equitably” distributed among
all producers, with no pro-
ducer getting less than cer-
tain fixed minimums. The
Secretary could also, when
total production e x c _e e-d e d
quotas, set -limits on the
amounts: that would be paid
to individual producers -in - suc-
ceeding» quarters. Payments

- wo u I-d be ‘completely sus-
‘ pended - whenever . productions-
. for two successive quarters
. exceeded total quotas by‘ speci-

fied: amounts until production
was again  brought within
quota. limits.

The net effect of the bill
would be to provide for gov-
ernment support of produc-
tion'—-at levels approximating

A 1957 production, and within a

limited price range. Secretary
Seaton estimates that the plan
will cost $161 million the first
year and lesser amounts each
succeeding year. if, as he an-
ticipates, the program brings
supply and demand into better
balance. "
Even supporters of the bill
concede that there is little, if
any, possibility of getting both
the original bill and the neces-
sary appropriations through
both Houses of Congress in
this sessian. The best that

-they hope for is“ to secure

favorable action in the next

. session of Congress next year. '
