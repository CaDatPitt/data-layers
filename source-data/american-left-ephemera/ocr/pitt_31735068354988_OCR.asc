Program on
Job Injuries

DENYER—A program to
guarantee injured workers’
compensation benefits and pro-
tect their future rights was blue-
printed by Mine-Mil1’s four top
officers last month in a com-
munication to nearly 1,000 offi-
cers and. stewards in mining,
mill, primary smelting and re-

- fining locals.

The letter from President
Clark, Vice-Presidents Howard
and Skinner and Secretary-
Treasurer Dichter is a follow-up
action in the union’s safety cam-
paign, launched early this year,
to cooperate with the U. S. Bu-
reau of Mines safety survey
which Mine-Mill hopes will point
up the long-due need for perma-
nent federal mine safety inspec-
tion and enforcement legislation.

Long standing company prac-
tices in the handling of work
injury cases which the union
has known about for years are
coming to light again. This has
resulted. from increased local
union attention to safety prob-
lems stimulated by local union
participation in mine fatality
investigations and health and
safety surveys.

COMPANY abuses that have
grown up around the handling
of work injuries are directed
toward discouraging the filing
of workmen’s compensation
claims.

This is done by inducing in-
jured men to take vacation pay,

by a July 1 strike deadline and
the assistance of Federal Media-
tion brought a negotiations vic-
tory at the end of June for the

' big Smelter & Refinery Workers
‘Local 837 in Carteret, New Jer-

sey.

’ The local, representing 1,200
employees of American Metals
Climax at its U. S. Metals Re-
fining Company plant, won a
package settlement estimated to
be worth between 21 and 22
cents an hour in economic bene-
fits plus some very important
contract lan gua ge improve-
ments.

The new agreement is for two
years, effective July 1, 1962. It
includes provisions for gradu-
ated wage increases of 8, 9, 10
and 11 cents per hour, depend-
ing on employees’ job cate-
gories, for 1962 with similar
pay boosts going into effect next
July 1, 1963.

KENNECOTT AGREEMENT MEMORANDUM is

DENVER-—Mine-Mill completed its drive last month
to wrap up 1962 contracts with major non-ferrous metals
producers and settle bargaining relations in the industry's
basic sections for the next two years.

Negotiations were successfully concluded with Ken-
necott Copper for its 4-state western division operations,
American Metals Climax for its big U. S. Metals Refining
Company property in Carteret, N. J., and the Anaconda
Company for its operations in Montana.

While the agreements were hammered through with-
out actual resort to strikes, settlements both with Kenne-
cott and U. S. Metals came only on the brink of announced
walk-out deadlines. In each case, the reality of ready

and the company to furnish $15

After weeks of negotiations
before final settlement it ap-

determining factor as to
whether or not a strike would

 DELMA ARAIZA

;Easier Way to

. Register Urged
 By Roy Reuther

V  »WASHINGTON, D. C. — Roy

Reuther, director ‘of the AFL-
CIO register and vote campaign,
"complained last month that it’s

-A easier for an American citizen
to buy a gun or get a fishing
license than it is to register for
voting.

1:

 lie said anybody who wants to

if . buy a gun or get a license for
.- fishing can do it anytime and
, practically anywhere. All he has

to do is go to his neighborhood

' - hardware store and getpit.
 But, he pointed out, if an un-

registered citizen wants to regis-
 ter to vote, he can do it only at

it . certain times of year and at

designated places requiring time
andvtravel to get to.

  He "called on cities to make

, registration facilities available
in every neighborhood, so that

' it would be as easy to register
,  asto buy a gun‘ or fishing li-
 : cense. This could be done at

every fire station, police station,
library, A high school and other
V public places, he said.
.~ 7 Reuther said that in Canada

L ' they register people on a door-

to,-door basis and the_ govern-
ment does the job just like the
census.

Some such system ought to be

used in this country, he said. If
they can afford to do it in Cana-
da, why not here? he asked.

 -’  4. She is Delma Araiza, ‘office secretary for San Manuel
 ,'lV_l,ine,gMill and Smelter Workers Local 937 at San Manuel '

Copper Company. In line

with the union’s drive to
register voters for the state
primary election in September
(the primary registration dead-
line was July 6), Miss Araiza
played a key part in efficiently
and effectively building the vot-
ing rolls at Mammoth and the
tri-city area here as a deputy
registrar in Pinal County.

In just a few short weeks
Delma registered more than 125
voters, an activity sandwiched
in between her regular duties-
as secretary in the Local 937
office. The work will continue
in connection with the registra-
tion deadline for the Fall elec-
tions.

Miss Araiza has served as
secretary for the Mine-Mill local
since early 1959, working in the
office with former Local 937
presidents Nick Key and Eddie
Lomeli, and now currently with
Fred’ Sanchez. She‘ was very
active in assisting the member-
ship during the 1959. strike.

=l<=l<|l<

SHE also assists the union’s
Health and Welfare committee’
in handling numerous hospital
and medical problems of mem-
bers’ wives who need informa-
tion and advice.

Among other activities, Delma
is presently serving as treasurer
of the “Fiestas Patrias,” the
annual Southern Arizona cele-
bration of September 16, Mexi-
can Independence Day spon-
sored by the Catholic Church of
San Manuel, Mammoth and
Oracle.

She is a member“ of the Mine-
Mill Local 937 Ladies Auxiliary
as well as a member of the
.'l‘ri-Community Democratic
Women’s Club.

Doesn't Know What.

But He's Against It

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Sena-
tor Lee Metcalf of Montana re-
cently reported he ‘received a
letter from one of his constitu-
ents, which read: ‘ ’

“When I received my notice
of savings and loan interest the
other day, there was enclosed
a request to write my sen-ator
in opposition to some bill. I
can’t find that slip now and
don’t know what bill, but you
probably know . . and I want
to tell you that I'm against it.”

SAN MANUELLOCAL 937 and its political action committee is continuing the program of hearing all Pinal
County candidates in the San Manuel-Mammoth-Oracle area for the Arizona primary election on Sept. ll".

THE MINE-MILL UNION

‘August. -19s~z:§    :

‘Vice-President:

Labor Takes a Look  

At the ‘New Frontier’

HE Kennedy administration has been in office only

18 months. This admittedly is too short a time to

make a conclusive assessment of the administration’s poli-
cies and record on labor and social legislation.

To date, the record is a weak one—and some very
disturbing trends, as far as working people
are concerned, are beginning to develop as
policies of the Kennedy administration.

They are as follows:

UNEMPLOYMENT — Refusal to boldly
tackle the growing problems of permanent
unemployment in the United states.

SHORTER WORKWEEK -— Open opposi-
tion to the shorter workweek as a basic method
of reducing unemployment and providing the
several million new jobs that are needed.

TAX CUTS—Adopting and advocating more
liberal tax and depreciation allowances for big
business to “spur plant modernization,” etc.

Such encouragement to business to modernize plants will re-
sult in more layoffs, increased production with fewer workers and
higher than ever profits. ’

This is despite the fact that a high percentage of America’s
capacity to produce is idle or unused 7 or 8 months out of the year.

, it ‘A’ at
QUALITY on taxes —— Proposals for “across the board” tax

 

Skinner

cuts to spur business activity. Very little is said about

“across the board” meaning the same percentage cut for the
little guy and the big corporations.

One proposal is 3 points tax cut for everyone. This would

result in $120 per year cut for a man earning $4,000, a cut of

$3,000 for the $100,000 a yearman, and millions in tax savings
for the big corporations. -

STRIKES AND LABOR DISPUTES — Since ‘the ‘_‘n0n-infla-

' tionary” steel settlement last April the Kennedy administration,

through Secretary of Labor Goldberg, has been injecting itself
at the bargaining table into more andbmore zlabor disputes -and.
very often to the detriment of .~ the» union -men. V » -

' : « A.-great many..labor disputes today including -the ;airlines-.and»

- railroads are- deep and‘ important struggles ’-to save the “jobs “of-V

' thousands of workers. b _  V

-.-When. these «men are told by government leaders that“ they. I
should forfeit their jobs and a lifetime of. seniority because it “is. p.
in -the national interest” or affe,cts.“national security," they don’t’

like such conclusions.
‘I: at .4: y ,
1 ESTRA'INTS’on all strikes —- Not many union workers are

aware of the fact that the Presidential Advisory Committee I

on Labor-Management Policy has recommended additional power
to the President to curb the right to strike and to dictate settle-
ment terms in labor disputes.

Such powers are to be used only in disputes which “threaten
the national-health and safety” — but who decides this? Or does
this-mean any big strike or any important strike?

Unfortunately, labor leaders on this ;Advisory Committee"
went along on granting _th_is unprecedented p_eacet_ime authority to

the President.

fksk ‘Ir

‘ ’ E havehto admire President Kennedy for -his bold fights
_ for the medicare program in Congress, for aid to edu:ca- -

tion, the poll tax ban, his position ‘on civil rights and other social
legislation. We applaud. him and support him in these and many
other efforts. We are convinced, however, that he will never defeat
the alliance of Southern Democrats and Republicans on all-import-
ant social legislation unless he carries this fight to the people as
Franklin Roosevelt did._

.And when we say carry it to the peoplefor support, that in-
cludes 20 million union men and women and their families, not
just a handful of labor leaders.

These union men and womenpwill support progressive labor
legislation, aid to schools, medical carefor the aged, the fight
against unemployment and all other decent social legislation -
but not if they -are to be restricted, hamstrung and denied the
right to strike every time they attempt to improve their own con-
ditions and job security in their own plant. Repressive labor
policies and legislation don’t belong in the New Deal, the Fair
Deal or the New Frontier! -— AL‘ SKINNER

A bill which Sen. Russell

pushing in Congress for the last
six years would permit ex-GI’s
who served between Oct. 8, 1940,

new policies they let lapse or
take out a maximum of $10,000

time if they didn’t take any out

The measure has passed the

Committee, under the chairman-

Result of Strike

For Charleston Local Leaders

CHARLESTON, S. C.—Two Mine-Mill rank and file _local leaders face jail sen-
tences of up to 25 years on blatant frame-up charges resulting from their .local’s
strike over a basic trade union wage and contract issue.

They are John Frazier and Holman Waters, president and shop steward respec-
tively of Charleston Local 863. Both were suddenly arrested last May for alleged in-

volvement in a year-old
episode during which a bus-
load of scabs being transported
to the struck Planters Fertilizer
and Phosphate Company plant
was fired upon.

Nobody was reported hurt in
the incident.
A >l< >l< >'s
' BECAUSE it is alleged the
bus was shot at in two counties,
Charleston and Dorchester, the
men face two separate trials.

Each was being held on $25,-
000 bond, $15,000 in Charleston
and $10,000 in Dorchester. (It
was learned late last month
that Frazier had made his bond

"and was finally released from

jail pending trial.)

The charges against the two
are serious. Waters is charged
with assault and attempt to
commit murder. Frazier is
charged with conspiracy in the
shooting episode.

ti! >l¢ )3

AT the hearing, the driver of
the bus could not identify any-
one as having done the shoot-
ing. Nor, he admitted, did he
know whether the "shots were
fired. from ‘a’ moving car or
camerfrom‘ ambush.- _

Aside from its strike-breaking

.. ‘character,’ '-‘instigation ‘of the
, .case may‘ well have had politi-

and bragging about the number

labor measure was enacted.
ii‘ til *

FACTS behind the case can
be told in simple trade union
terms.

Local 863 members at Plant-
ers were forced on strike Jan.
30, 1961, after months of fruit-
less negotiations and attempts
by Federal Mediation to get the
company to make any offer at
all proved to no avail.

Out of 17 companies under
contract with Mine-Mill locals
in South Carolina and Georgia,
Planters was the only one refus-
ing to negotiate a settlement.

As a result, Planters wages
were from six to 13 cents an
hour below those of the other
16 companies, not counting a
further discrepancy in shift dif-

ill ii! ‘is

WHILE negotiations were still
going on, the company bought
two buses to transport scabs,
hired special guards for the
buses and plant and installed
ﬂoodlights around the property.
Police were posted ‘even before

’ -the local struck and established

picket lines. ' -
Then  the V .c o m p a n y; began

S transporting “scabs from among -
the unemployed in‘- the area,

some from as faraway as 50

miles. The "picket lines, how- ‘

ever, prevented anything, but
limited operation of the plant.

THE Superior Sun article
quoted the Local 938 telegram,
signed by legislative chairman

~Joe Pursley, to the Arizona leg-

islators in Washington which
said: “We oppose the harass-
ment of Mine-Mill by the SACB
and urge action to see these
charges laid to rest.”
Lengthiest reply came from
Senator Goldwater who con-
firmed Mine-Mill’s position that
the SACB order has no effect
until all judicial review is ex-
hausted, including petitions to
both the SACB and the U. S.
Court of Appeals to have the
order set aside. The union has

taken both, steps.

“The order of the Board does
not become finalguntil the re-
view process has been com-
pleted,” Senator Goldwater told
Local 938. ‘

Santa Cruz, ﬂatly denying any
Communist-infiltration of the

union, told the‘ Superiore Sun:

“We stronglywfeel the charges

resume negotiations were an-
swered by further company at-
tempts to break the strike. Of!
fers to rehire strikers without

Although many of the members
had secured employment in
other plants,_the picket line was

cott’s western operations will
have identical rates.

(As a result of these gains,
wage rates at the different
operations now range uni-
formally from $18.98 common
labor to a top of $25.70 per day

"with 42 cents per shift incre-

ments between job classes, in-
creasing next year to a range
of from $19.46 to $26.35 with

43 cents per shift increments ‘

starting July 1, 1963.)

pay to 6, 9 and 12 cents per
hour effective July 1, 1962, from
the previous 5, 71/.» and 10.

IN ADDITION -to the straight
wage gains, several significant
achievements were scored in
Health & Welfare and Pension
benefits.

Among the Health & Welfare
improvements, most important
are:

0 The company assumed full
costs of all hospital, medical
and surgical benefits, for which
the previous premium contri-
bution was $5.55 per month for

rmarried. employees and $3.10

per month for single employees.

0 Many significant new bene-
fits on hospital, medical and
surgical coverage were added
to the H&W program, includ-
ing: company—paid Major Medi-
cal for dependents; full cover-
age on hospital room, board and
extras for employees and de-
pendents; and complete cover-
age on surgical fees for em-
ployees - and dependents.

IFull coverage of pension-
ers and their dependents under
a Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan
that will pay virtually all hospi-

tal and surgical charges.

Other new benefits in the
plan concern X-ray allowances,
broadened eligibility definitions,
and continuation of coverage
after layoff or leave-of-absence
and during sickness or disabili-
ty—without charge to employee.

The over-all new HMS pro-
gram for employees, depend-
ents and pensioners—developed
out of hundreds of hours of pre-
liminary work, research and
conferences——is considered to be
one of the best in this-or any
other industry.

PRESIDENT John Clark

1‘ touchedoff the campaign last,

September with a letter and
Mine-Mill Research Department
memorandum sent to senators,
congressmen, cabinet officers
and others in government, thor-
oughly alerting them to the

‘ situation.

Government activity was also
.spurred by a Mine-Mill rank
and file delegation from Wash-
ington and New Jersey locals
to the nation’s capitol where

, they met with Senators Williams

and Case and Congressman Fre-
linghuysen of New Jersey and

A Senators Jackson and Magnuson

of Washington. Conferences
were also held with Commerce

~ and Labor‘ department officials.

V Urged by the union were U. S.
action to limit scrap exports to

Japan, U. S. protest of a Jap-

anese government ban on re-
fined copper imports as well as
Japanese tariff discrimination

‘against refined copper imports.
_ III Ilt Ii!

THE Japanese ban had had
they-effect of raising the Jap-
anese price of copper about 5
cents above the U. S. price,

1 making it possible for Japanese

smelters to outbid U. S. smelters

for concentrates and scrap.

While the U. S. government
did not impose export controls
on shipments of copper -and
brass scrap to Japan, it did vig-
orously protest heavy Japanese
purchases of scrap in-the U. S.,
and in conferences in Washing-

S ton. and Tokyo urged the Jap-

anese to permit importation of
refined copper to lessen Jap-
anese competition for concen-

trates and scrap. These efforts .

have continued.

Dispatches from Tokyo indi-
cate, the U. S. Ambassador in
June requested the Japanese
government to restrain Japa-
nese smelters from paying pre-
mium prices for copper ores
and» concentrates which Amer-
ican smelters cannot pay. He is
reported to have said that Jap-
anese purchasing at unreason-

ably high prices had become a r

political issue in the United
States. Reports of the Japanese

- government’s reply have not yet

been received.
' 31: 1| #1

'0NE result of U. S. protests
was. a sharp decline beginning
last. October in Japanese scrap
purchases in. this country.

In the five months from Janu-

 ary to May, 1962, U. S. ship-

ments of copper and brass scrap
to Japan totaled 16,018 tons,
compared with--53,594 tons in the
corresponding months of 1961.,
The Japanese have also this
year started to permit importa-
tion-of limited quantities of elec-

A RECENT development was

‘the introduction last month of

identical bills by Senators Jack-

son and Magnuson of Washing- _

ton, and by Congressman Cecil
King of -California, to repeal for
three years the 1.7 cent per
pound'U. S. import tax on the
copper content of ores and con-

; centrates. » .

This, saidthe sponsors, would
permit U. S. smelters to pay up

Chile

Mines and plants of Anaconda
subsidiaries in Chile were on
strike last month at El Salva-
dor, Potrerillos and Santiago.
The strike at Santiago began on
June 18 and at El Salvador

about July 1.

No word that either dispute
had been settled had been re-
ceived at Mine-Mill Union press
time. The Portrerillos walkout
was of short duration and was
settled July 9.

  

  IN DUSTY  Noﬁs  

COPPER producers at home and abroad last month cut back
mine production. Cuts announced in July included the following:

Anaconda: 5 percent in U. S. and Chile; Inspiration: 9 percent;

_Phelps Dodge: 5 percent; Noranda Mines (Canada): 5 percent;

Waite Amulet (Canada): declining, shutting down in October;
K_a_tanga (Congo): 5 percent; Anglo-American (Rhodesia): Stock-
pihng 5 percent of output; Rhodesian Selection Trust (Rhodesia):
5 percent; Braden (Kennecott-Chile): Production reported below
last year’s rate because of short water supplies.

Trade sources say world copper production in recent months
has exceeded copper consumption by about 5 percent, although
this has not yet shown up in rising stocks of producer-held refined
copper.

Foreign and U. S. copper producers appear to be reacting much

more quickly to indications of reduced demands and a possible

buildup of-stocks than in the 1957-58 period before and during the

copper slump. Their objective appears to be to cut production
enough to maintain the present price of 31 cents per pound for
copper. Phelps Dodge is cutting back by shortening the work week.

. By Mine-Mill Union press time, no layoffs had been reported
either at the Anaconda mines in Butte or at Inspiration Copper in

Arizona.

SLOW demand for zinc, a 15 percent increase in European
stocks since January 1, price weakness taking the form of discounts
on posted U. S. prices and other factors led to announcement of
production cuts by major U. S. zinc producers last month: ,

Anaconda cut refined production of zinc at Great Falls by 15
percent.

American Metal Climax’ smelter at Blackwell, Oklahoma, is
curtaihng by one-third during June, July and August and may not
fully restore the cut in September. ~

American_Smelting and Refining is cutting production at its
Corpus Christi, Texas, plant by 5 percent.

American Zinc, Lead and Smelting cut production of prime
western zinc by 10 percent.

National Zinc at Bartlesville, Oklahoma, had been struck for
over six weeks at Mine-Mill Union press time by the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers.

St._ Joe and New Jersey Zinc, according to trade sources, are
operating at -a lower rate thanrat the beginning of 1962.

pay, or putting them on com-
pany financed sickness and ac-
cident benefits during the period

of disablement. "

When a man working on a
crew becomes disabled, compa-
nies are known to have pres-
sured his fellow crew members
to work short handed until the
injured man recovered. Acci-
dents handled this way may not
be reported as lost time acci-

dents.

THE companies figure they
can save money in the long run
if they can avoid the filing of a
workmen’s compensation claim.
Even if they give a disabled
man his regular pay, or give
him company financed sickness
and accident benefits, usually
more than workmen’s compen-
sation benefits, they are ahead
in the long run. It keeps their
workmen’s compensation insur-
ance premium rates down.

More important, workers who .
rights.

don’t file for workmen’s com-
pensation can lose their rights
to future compensation benefits
in the event that disablement
vreoccurs or becomes permanent,
or if complications develop after
a man seems to be recovered.
Frequently a disablement that
seems minor or temporary can
develop serious complications
later. But when an injured man
7 forfeits his right to future com-
pensation by not filing promptly,

the company escapes all liabil- ,

ity with respect to these pro-
longed and more expensive
types of injuries.

Every work accident should

“The Miner” is the name giv-

. en to a huge machine in Ohio

owned by Peabody Coal Com-

pany; It can reach. 1,000 feet

into a shaft and rip out coal

and send it out by way of con-
veyer belt.

Only five men, working out-
side the. shaft, operate the ma-
chine. They rely on remote
control devices inside the shaft
which send messages on ground
conditions that. are recorded
on control instruments.

The company says men with-
out previous mine experience
work the machines best.

. >I= ii: =l=

THAT’S because, the com-
pany says, the men must learn
how to read the instruments
and are less likely to try to
outguess the machine’s radar
or sonar-like devices,

seldom make mistakes.

The machine weighs 750 tons
and is, designed to mine 800
tons in an eight-hour shift-—the

0 If his period of disablement
is less than the waiting period
for workmen’s compensation
benefits, the injured man should
still file to protect’ his future
rights.

0 If the injured man receives
company financed sickness and
accident benefits, he should file
for the same" reason given
above. Depending on what state
he lives in, he might or might
not be eligible to receive work-
men’s compensation benefits in
addition to company financed
benefits.

0 If he goes on vacation while
disabled, many states will pay
workmen’s compensation in ad-
dition to vacation pay. No man
should be induced against his
wishes to take vacation pay
while injured. He should, file
for workmen’s compensation,

tion pay, in order to protect his

among other things, of getting their official newspapers" to their‘

members. "Now a new expense jump has been added. "

Last January, the U. S. Post Office Department DOUBLED
its charge for returning undelivered copies of papers due to the
reader's change of address. This applies to all second, third and
fourth class mail, including the Mine-Mill Union and every other
labor paper. Each of these returns used to cost the union 5
cents apiece, every issue. Now the Post Office charges 10 ‘cents

on each return.

_ Added up every month, the cost of these returns becomes
s1zable._ You can help reduce this needless expense.

in front of the loaded car and
was not seen by the brakemen
or other employees who noticed
the eight empty cars moving
out of control. -

The federal inspector’s recom-
mendations for prevention of

future accidents of this sort _

were: '

0 Machinery and equipment .

should not be moved until all
personnel in the immediate area
have been warned.-

O A suitable‘ warning device
such as a horn, buzzer or siren,
should be installed, employees

should be instructed, -and a sign

ARON COX and Raymond

,L. Colbert of the Machin-
ists unit at the Magma Copper
Company mine at Superior, Ari-
zona, were killed on June 2.
They were in the lead car of a
man train of 14 or more cars

’ being pushed on the 2550 level.

The U. S. Bureau of Mines re-
port states that the lead car
struck a coupling on an air line
laid on the ground alongside the
track, was derailed and turned
over on its side. Cox and Col-
bert suffered fractured skulls
and spine injuries. The report
notes that Bureau of Mines rec-
ords indicate that pushing of
cars is a hazardous practice
that has resulted in numerous
accidents. -

Recommendations in the re-
port were:

0 The practice of pushing
man trips should be eliminated.
All cars should be pulled inso-
far as possible. —

O A positive means for stop-j

ping a car or cars that might
become disconnected ‘from the
trip should be provided.

" 0 Company ’ policy of_install-

ing pipelines overhead should be .

followed. '

0 Loose rock, pipe,’ rail, tim-
ber and trash should not be al-
lowed to accumulate so as to
present an obstruction to cars.
or motors on haulageways.
