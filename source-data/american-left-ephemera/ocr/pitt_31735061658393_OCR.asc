of law. But, as President Roosevelt said in Georgia, “Apparently I

a law or a clause in the Constitution was not enough.” It takes
money to go to school, and for millions of American families
there is not enough money.

Through the democratic front the people demand their demo-
cratic right to study and learn.

In the shops and factories, the mills and mines, trade unions
are the instruments of democracy.

Against the democratic right to organize, picket, and strike,
the reactionary enemies of democracy used the law, the courts,
the armed forces of the state, their spy systems and their
armed thugs.

Trade unionists were convicted of "criminal conspiracy.”
Unions were outlawed as a "combination to raise wages.”

In the name of "democracy,” of "law and order,” women and
children were burned to death and miners shot down at Ludlow;
the Haymarket martyrs were hanged; Mooney and Billings
were framed and imprisoned; Sacco and Vanzetti murdered,
Angelo I-Ierndon sent to jail.

Not until the Roosevelt Administration and the passage of
the Wagner Act did workers win legal recognition of their
democratic rights to organize, bargain collectively, and strike.

But the open-shoppers defy the laws of the land. And legal... ~

recognition of their rights did not save the steel workers in
South Chicago from death on Memorial Day, 1937.

The history of American democracy is a history of many
battles lost and won. The people have advanced, but they have
not yet reached their goal. Only by heroic defense of the positions
they have won can they go forward, fulﬁlling the promise of
"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” held out to them by
their Constitution.

AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IN DANGER

Today the positions won by the people at such heavy sacriﬁce

are in grave danger. Only part way out of the economic crisis
10

that began in 1929, our country has again been plunged into a
new depression.

Monopoly attacks the people on every front, robbing them of
their jobs, their wages, robbing them again through its control
of prices. Monopoly, which brought on the crisis and made it
worse, would use it now to rob the people of their democratic
rights—in order to go on robbing them, without mercy and

t ‘ unchecked.

But the people, wiser, stronger, better organized than in 1929,
block the road. On every front they are ﬁghting back. More and
more they have come to understand the lesson made so clear by
the LaFollette Civil Liberties Committee. They see that the
attack on democracy is an attack on the living standards of the
people, and on the organizations through which they ﬁght for a
better life. Wherever democracy is denied the people-—in Jersey
City, in Harlan County, in the Imperial Valley of California,
in the sharecropper country, in Governor Davey’s Ohio steel
towns—there are low wages, hunger and misery. There the light
for democracy is a ﬁght for bread. There the reactionaries attack
democracy with new desperation, seeing how the people seize this
weapon to drive their enemies from economic and political power.

Where the embryo storm troops of fascism ﬂourish—the Black

.. Legion in the auto towns, the "citizens committees” that spring

into sudden being during a strike, Ku Kluxism, anti-Catholic
and anti-Semitic Silver Shirts, vigilantes, lynch gangs and night
riders—there under the mask and the nightshirt is the face of
Big Business, set against the people. Big Business foots the bill,

-1 N buys the guns and tear gas, pays off the thugs. Thirty thousand
“dollars to the Mayor of Johnstown, hundreds of thousands of

dollars in a single year to the munitions makers, $80,000,000
to the detective agencies. Not a penny for higher wages, but
millions to put the people down.

In today’s historic battles to preserve and extend American
democracy, the trade unions have become the shock troops of all
the people. Only when the trade unions stormed the open-shop

ll

.N‘
' ‘K.

 
 

fortresses did democracy enter the company towns. The unions

must heal the split in their own ranks and win support of all the .

people if they are to hold the front trenches against reaction.

The sit-down strike of big capital is the offensive of reaction ,

against the people and against democracy. To win on the eco-
nomic front, monopoly capital needs a political victory..It needs
to win the coming elections for Congress. It needs a Congress

that will enforce its program of starvation and block all pro»

gressive measures. It needs a Congress that will "let business

alone”—-to cut wages, pile up ever bigger proﬁts, smash the ‘

unions, escape taxation.

But the people need another kind of Congress.

And the people can get it! Their unity will be the measure of
their strength.

The people need democracy today more than ever before.

And today democracy is in gravest danger.

The people must close their ranks, marching forward together
in the democratic front.

The democratic front can beat back the offensive of reaction.
It can elect a Congress that will break the sit-down strike of
big capital and win recovery.

This Congress must curb the autocratic power of the Supreme

Court and the judiciary to put legal barriers in the way of’

progress.

It must legislate to control the trusts and monopolies,

tighten the control of the stock exchanges. It must nationalize
the banks, railways and munitions industry; relieve farmers and

small property owners of their debt burdens. It must give thgr  

people a voice in the fixing of prices and extend public and
cooperative marketing facilities; and grant the farmers a larger-
share in administering the agricultural, farm and soil conserva-
tion laws. It must end for all time the shame of lynching. It
must take steps to abolish poll taxes and every other form of
disfranchisement. It must also democratize itself, freeing the
Congress from the dictatorship of the House Rules Committee
12

C which in the last session blo-cl<ed the Wages and Hours Bill and

 

the amendments to the Walsh-Healey Act.

The victory of the democratic front in the coming elections
alone can safeguard American democracy. And only this victory
can prepare the way for the next victory of democracy—for the
coming of the people’s front.

DEMOCRACY ON THE WORLD FRONT

Our modern world has shrunk so small that the United States
can no longer rely on a policy of isolation. It must become an
active force for world peace and democracy. i

Today the struggle for democracy is a world struggle and, in
Spain and China, already a bloody one. The people ‘gathered
together in the democratic front for the coming elections must

tatives in Congress. They must ask all candidates not only where
they stand on the question of democracy at home, but also
whether they are ready to make America a force for peace and
democracy throughout the world.

. The road to America’s defense of world democracy was

‘ last October. The people must elect a Congress ready to take
that road, ready to stop all traffic with the war-makers and to
use America’s privileged economic position to “quarantine the
aggressors.” _
The future of democracy at home is bound up with its future

-V on this Western hemisphere. The encroachments of fascism in

South America and Canada, its plots against the democratic
Cardenas government in Mexico———these are a threat to our own
safety which cannot be ignored. Only democracies make good
neighbors.

Unless we extend the neighborly hand of fellowship and
cooperation to the democratic peoples of the New World we
shall find ourselves living among thieves and gangsters who
13

take this world situation into account in choosing their represen- .. .

charted by President Roosevelt in his historic Chicago speech of V

 

plot against us with the thieves and gangsters within our own’
borders. But. by lending support to the democratic forces
throughout the Americas we shall check world fascism and hasten
its destruction everywhere. In this we shall find the ﬁnal assur-
ance that our own democracy is permanent and safe.

THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY

  

Democracy, which has so glorious a past and so stirring a a

present, has a future as well.‘

Today’s struggle for democracy is the struggle for the demo-
cratic front: the unity of all progressives in support of one can-
didate for each office; the election unity of all the organizations
in which the progressive people are gathered today; the support
of the democratic people for a program they accept——now.

Through the struggle for the democratic front the people weld
an independent political organization whose basic force must be

the unity of the trade union movement, not yet achieved. They ‘

advance a more democratic program and fight for that program.
They build the people’s front and put a people’s front gov-
ernment in power. _

In this way it best strengthens the people for tomorrow’ s
battles, for the struggles for the people’s front which is the’
immediate future of democracy.

The Communist Party supports the democratic front and
ﬁghts the battles of democracy today.

' But the horizons of democracy extend beyond the achievement
of the people’s front. Q

From the democratic front to the people’s front. From the
people’s front to socialism, the highest form of democracy. That
is the future of democracy for which the Communist Party
strives.

The economic foundations for a complete democracy where
men are truly free and equal because there is no longer the ex-
ploitation of man by man do not exist in America today. They
14

J

_,/

do exist in the Soviet Union where the people of the world can
qpk at their future and see it work.

   
    
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  

K‘, , eople. More than 90 per cent of it is owned by the great
corporations. This small minority rules the whole national eco-
nomic life. All that holds it in check is the exercise of their
democratic rights by the people, the limited control they are able
to put on it through their voice in the national government.

The economic royalists are out to rid themselves of even this
limited control——by destroying democracy altogether.

Democracy can only be defended by extending this control, by
restoring the national economy to the people. President Roosevelt
has restated the principles of Jeffersonian democracy in terms
of the changed conditions of modern life. But he does not fight
consistently for democracy because he does not aim at destroying
the monopolies and restoring the national economy to the people.
He tries to curb the power of the monopolies, and at the same
time preserve capitalism.

Only the Communist Party ﬁghts consistently for democracy:
for the defense of democracy today through the democratic
front; for the extension of democracy in the immediate future
through a people’s front; for the highest stage of democracy-—
which is socialism.

The majority of the American people do not yet accept this
full program of the Communist Party. They are not yet ready
for socialism, not yet convinced that our whole society must be
reorganized in order to save democracy.

But they are ready to fight for democracy against its enemies
 today, to support the program of the democratic front which
represents their most immediate and pressing needs.

The Communist Party moves forward with the people, de-
fending their past achievements,»organizing their present strug-
gles, blazing the trail ahead. It proves its right to proclaim:

Communism I: Twentieth Century Americanism.

DEMOCRACY IN DANGER

By MARY COLLINS

’ ROGRESS or reaction, democracy or fascism?
P The issue is being decided. Now. Today.
A major battle in this struggle is being fought in the 1938
elections.
Once more an economic crisis grips our country, inflicting fresh
suffering on a people still bleeding from the wounds of 1929.
Which way out of the crisis? Will the people win recovery?
Will they break the sit-down strike of big capital? Will workers,

“farmers, and the middle class be able to buy again? Will Amer-

ica go back to work?

Or-—will the economic royalists “solve” the crisis in their way?
Will the trusts and monopolies succeed in their drive to cut
wages? Will more workers lose their jobs, more farmers their
farms, more small business men go into bankruptcy? Will the
cost of living go up and the living standards of the people down?
Will the offensive of reaction against the people win out?

On the answer to all these questions the future of American
democracy depends.

Wherever the people ﬁght for their most immediate and press-
ing needs: To hold their homes and farms against foreclosure,
to defend their trade unions, to resist wage cuts and lay-offs, to

W ‘  fwfii: . 
l

    
 

protest discrimination and the oppression of racial and religious ,
minorities, to break the sit-down strike of big capital and curb .- i N‘ 
the power of the trusts, to abolish the poll tax—he_re the die is
being cast for democracy. T '

And in the Chambers of Commerce, the National Association
of Manufacturers, around the conference tables of Big Business,
in the secret meetings of “citizens’ committees” and Black Le-
gions—there reaction marshals its forces to decide the issue p
for fascism. Those who hold the monopolizcd wealth of America ""*-4.

— muster the vast resources of that wealth to beat back the rising
democratic tide. _ y L

The coming Congressional elections are a major engagement  74 if
in the ‘battle between democracy and fascism, between a people’s ,  I_' [ '2
recovery and the reactionary offensive against the people.  ' A 1

In the November elections the political organizations of the

 camps of reaction and progress meet in a head-on clash.

On the one side, rallied to the banner of progress and democ-
racyancl supporting Roosevelt and the New Deal, are the pro-
gressive New Deal forces in the Democratic Party, trade unions
—-—the A. F. of L., C.I.O., and Railway Brotherhoods——Labor’s
Non-Partisan League, the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party, the
Washington Commonwealth Federation, the American Labor
Party of New York, the Progressive Party of Wisconsin, the
Farmers Union, the American Youth Congress, the National
Negro Congress, the American League for Peace and Democracy,
the various movements to aid Spain and China, and all the other
truly liberal and forward-moving forces in America.

The Communist Party gives its full support to this camp,
striving to unite all who cherish democracy, to weld them in a
broad democratic front. ‘ '

  

 

 

On the other side stands the Republican Party, dominated by V
a reactionary leadership seeking to defeat the New Deal. It 4
works toward a coalition with the reactionary Democrats and all 
other enemies of democracy. It backs the Garner-for-President 
campaign while priming other reactionary candidates. ‘ R‘

4

«O

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vastly outnumbered by the people, the camp of reaction can-i

not conquer except by dividing the forces of progress. It therefore it

lends all possible support to the anti-New Deal forces in the
Democratic Party, and promotes a fratricidal struggle in the
ranks of labor, making use of the reactionary leadership of the
A. F. of L. ' W

The headquarters of the camp of reaction are in Wall Street,
but its well-organized control extends across the land in a net-

work of interlocking directorates, holding companies, and cor? D

rupt party machines. Desperate since its defeat by the people in r
1936, reaction has launched a new offensive, determined to win
in 1933. i

The 1938 elections take on even deeper meaning when we re-
member that now not only America but all the world is locked in
the struggle to decide the course of human history.

In this struggle there are no bystanders and no non-comba-gt
rants. What is happening in Spain and in China is but the ,
symbol of what may happen everywhere if reactionary monoboly “ a

capital has its way.

Fascist bombs bring death to women and children, and de-
struction to cities and farms. Fascism wrecks the lives of all who —
come within its range, sparing no one.

No man and no nation can escape the consequences of this
decision. What is decided for all will be the fate of each, of the i
great powers and the little countries, of the ﬁghters and the
stay-at-homes.

No man and no nation can escape responsibility for the decision
that must be made. It is no longer a question of whether to speak
or be silent, to act or leave action to others. The unspoken word,
the act too long postponed—these weigh heavy in the scales of
history. ii

The ballot that is not cast for democracy is a vote for reaction,
for fascism.

Today the main issue is—progress or reaction, democracy or
fascism: to which side» do you throw your weight?

 A A HOW AMERICANS ANSWER,

True to the traditions of the world’s first great democratic

‘nation, the overwhelming majority of the people of the United
' States answer: We want democracy.

To our people “democracy” is a ﬁghting word. They hear ‘in
it the echo of all the ﬁghting words that ring through our his-
tory: the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the
Gettysburg Address and the Emancipation Proclamation. The
American people reaﬂirm their faith in government of the people,

. by the people, for the people, and once more determine it shall

not perish from the earth.

No one knows this better than the would-be fascists, than the
Hearsts, du. Ponts, Morgans, Vandenbergs and Gamers. Because
they have heard the answer of the American people, these enemies

of democracy themselves pretend to be its defenders.

They dare not come out openly and say, "We are for fascism.”
If they did, who would rally to their colors?

And so they hide their oﬁensive against wages and the trade
unions which bulwark wages by pretending to attack the Wagner
Act in the name of "democracy.”

They hide their offensive against all progressive legislation by

pretending to defend the usurped power of the Supreme Court 

from democratic reform——in the name of democracy. They say,
"The New Deal is regimentation. Roosevelt wants to be dictator.”

And in the same way they attack the Roosevelt recovery pro-
gram and wages and hours legislation. In the name of "democ-
racy” they seek their own “solution” of the crisis, the solution
which would lead to more unemployment, pauper standards of re-
lief, sweatshop wages and further impoverishment of the farmers.

In this way the enemies of democracy, the big bankers and
monopolists, the reactionaries in both Republican and Demo-
cratic Parties, try to fool the American people and win recruits
for their reactionary aims.

In this way they try to defeat the democratic program of
6

D recovery which alone can-safeguard the lives of the people, and if
the life of democracy itself. ‘

WHAT IS DEMOCRACY?

What is democracy?
Democracy is the people’s mighty weapon against starvation
and misery. It is the lever with which they raise their standards

 of living. No "safety valve,” democracy is itself the steam with

which the people drive forward to the solution of their problems.
Democracy means free speech, free press and free assembly.
What is it that the people want to speak and write about, or
talk over together? Nothing less than the fundamental condi-
tions that determine their lives: wages, hours of work, the high
cost of living, the need for jobs or relief, lack of medical care,
security for their old age, opportunity for their children.
Through freedom of speech, press, and assembly, the people
ﬁnd their way to one another. They organize and grow strong.
Therefore Mayor Hague keeps this dangerous freedom out of
jersey City. If the people met and organized—-Hague and his
sweatshops would go. In Harlan County the coal operators en-
forced the same bloody rule of silence-——for Kentucky miners

would talk of unions, and of righting their wrongs. _
Democracy means the right to vote. In the coming elections

votes will decide.

Votes will decide between relief and starvation for the unem-
ployed, between farm aid and farm bankruptcy, farm ownership
and the slavedom of tenancy for farmers. At the polls workers

Wwill choose between the Wagner Act and the suppression of

trade unions, between extending the social security laws and re-
pealing them, between higher wages and a return to sweatshop
competition. The people who cast their votes for democracy and
against reaction will vote for relieving their tax burdens——by tax-
5ing those in the higher income brackets, those best able to pay;
‘for curbing the economic power over their lives now wielded by

7

 

 

the giant monopolies; for stock market control and the protec-
tion of their investments; for better housing at lower cost; for
the preservation of the country’s natural resources from the
plundering of the robber barons.
Votes will decide between the program of the democratic front
and the program of reaction, driving headlong to fascism and war.
If the people ﬁght for recovery—and win; if they rally in the
democratic front and achieve its full program; if they defeat the
Wall Street offensive against their living standards; if they
secure a government of their own, a people’s front govern-
ment—-then, and only then, can they save American democracy.
To ﬁght for democracy is to use democracy, always and every-
yvhere, for bread, for a better life, for winning more and higher
forms of democracy. A 1
Only those who use it so can claim to be its defenders. ?_ A 3
Who are the real defenders of American democracy today?
The lords of Wall Street and their Republican Party? Those
who give lip-service to democracy but ﬁght to maintain the power
of the economic royalists? The "yes-but” men who block every
democratic attempt to solve our economic problems? Tom Girdler
who shot down the steel workers on strike for the right of col-
lective bargaining? Henry Ford who ﬂouts the Wagner Act and

is decorated by Hitler for his services? The Southern Democrats/...

who ﬁlibuster against the Anti-Lynching Bill?
No! The defenders of democracy are the militant trade unions,
the jobless workers ﬁghting for jobs, the tillers of the soil ﬁght-

ing to save their farms, the progressive people themselves_ and °

the progressive organizations ﬁghting for the people’s daily needs.
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY HAS A PAST

In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson wrote of the
ct - 9: - - -
long train of abuses which drove the colonists to assert their
revolutionary rights and win the beginnings of democracy.
The “long train of abuses” struck at the daily lives of the

u

people. England monopolized their trade—cheated them when

they sold,‘ and again when they came to buy. A
C The American Revolution succeeded, and the battle for democ-

racy was begun. It has continued through the years, and‘ it goes
on today.

The people fought ﬁrst against the rich landowners, demand-
ing the right to vote.

Landless farmers and poor workers, the "rabble” of ]ackson’s

day won the vote and elected Jackson president.

The Negro people, ﬁghting side by side with progressive whites
from the North and Middlewest, won their freedom and began
the struggle for equal rights in a bloody Civil War.

The bosses tried to keep the vote from foreign-born Catholic
workers, crying: "We must save the country from Romanism.”
After a bitter struggle the attack on the Catholics was defeated,
and naturalized citizens were assured the right to vote.

Votes for women marked another stage in the struggle for  r‘

suffrage, for democracy.
But—the right to vote is not yet fully won. The poll tax in

eight Southern states and “grandfather clauses” still keep poor’
. whites and Negroes disfranchised. It keeps the landlord poli-

ticians in oﬂice.

Today the new, progressive South, determined to solve its
economic problems, takes its place in the democratic front, carry-
ing forward the battle for suffrage which is as old as our country.

The people fought against the rich landowners and industrial-
ists, demanding education.

"Learning has brought disobedience into the world,” said a

governor of Virginia in 1650. Men and masters alike knew that

knowledge is power. And so the men strove for that power, and
the masters to withhold it from them.
 But—today the President’s committee reporting on the South
tells us that almost 9 per cent of the Southern people cannot
read or write.

The people have won free public school education as a matter
