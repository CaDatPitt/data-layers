Bourgeois
Nationalism

Q}?

We have emphasized repeatedly the primacy,theo

very great importance, of forging attitudes of the
deepest concern for each Communist undertaking
the personal obligation to make a heroic contribu-
tion, based upon our advanced consciousness, to the
struggle to eradicate the main psychological bloc to
class victory of our working class on the road to
socialism. That is, to address the question of racism
which is such a deep psychological presence standing
in the way of pooling the objectively ripe revolution-
ary energy of the American working class for making
the required advance onto the plane of social
revolution and to advance toward a new social
structure in our country worthy of our people’s rich
history and promise.

human equation not to be guilty of what Lenin
characterized the Bundist spokesman, Yurkevich, of
being guilty of. Yurkevitch was an opponent of
contact, unity, intermarriage, interrelations between
peoples. We are not. We are not pushers for
individual intermarriage, but we are absolutely
opposed to anybody being pushers against it. It is a
mark of liberation, it is a progressive thing and not a
reactionary thing, if we were to classify its general
direction. But above all, it is an individual choice and
we must never permit in our own thinking any
attitudes to manifest themselves that there is some-
thing wrong in inter-racial relationships and, it is the
essence of prejudice and backwardness to so perceive
it. It is to lock oneself into one’s national shell and
defend it with bigotry. The world’s peoples, in the jet
age, in the age of massive travels, of intercourse
between peoples and nations, can no longer perceive
of progressive development through the golden high
fences establishing segregation of peoples as a
principle. It is the antithesis of progressive principle.
It is related to everything backward and misin-
formed. Progressive principle is the exchange, inter-
course, interplay, interpenetration of cultures and
toward the amalgamation of peoples.

We take note on this 60th anniversary of the Great
October Revolution, that the Soviet Union has had
history’s most scientiﬁc on-going experience in the
solution of the national question and has modeled a
pattern for the whole world to follow. What is being
built and has been built in the Soviet Union is a
prototype of the world of the future when not just a
hundred different nationalities will be living as
members of one family, but when all nationalities,
some 2,000 or more, in the whole world will be living
as one people.

In the Soviet Union, in Birobidjan there are more
non-Jews than Jews, and you could say that about
every national territory in the Soviet Union. In the
«Soviet Union .there are more non-Russians than
Russians. There is taking place an amalgamation and
integration of peoples; Each region retains its
national culture and so on, but the national culture is
already diffused among all other peoples, and all
other people come to appreciate and respect this
national culture. There are no second class citizens.

The Soviet Union, a couple of years ago, released
very interesting statistics on the extent of inter-
marriage between various nationalities. They re-
leased them with pride, they released these statistics
as an evidence that generally accepted by all of the
nationalities is the premise that in the Soviet Union
there are no inferior and superior cultures. There is
no national egotism that is so latent and brazen that
one wants to lock oneself in one’s own national shell
so as not to make contact with any other people. In
the work process, in the building of socialism, all the
various nationalities have interchange and contact
from the school and the workbench to the social and
civic duties as citizens, and from these contacts ﬂow
and develop normal human relationships and, across
the national lines, there is an exchange among
peoples. Intermarriage is a logical consequence, an
affirmation that there is nothing lost, nothing to be
feared. All peoples’ culture and personality and
national identity will be respected in the common
society that all are committed to perfect. Therefore,
these statistics are very revealing and, as the national

' prejudices have gone, these statistics which Leonid-

Brezhnevreleased with some considerable joy affirm
the viability and historic validity of the Leninist
concept of the solution of the national question. On a
different plane, on a plane of equality, on a plane of
mutual respect, there will be a natural interﬂow
between peoples. This will not solve the problem; this
will be an index that the problem is solved.

Unity to End Oppression

Mutual respect and equality, without any qualiﬁ-
cations, this is the essence of intemationalism.
Therefore, in our movement, we above all must
guarantee that we do not fall victim to bourgeois
prejudices which will build fences of exclusiveness
around different nationalities and produce some
double sense of values.

The national question is a major aspect, a strategic
component of the world revolutionary process. In his
article, The Working Class and the National Ques-
tion, published in Pravda on May 10, 1913
(Collected Works, Vol. 19), Lenin placed this
question high on the roster of strategic relationships

V for continuing attention. “The national question

must be clearly considered and solved by all class
conscious workers,” he said. Lenin wrote “. . . Today
the bourgeoisie fears the workers . . . and is betraying
democracy, advocating oppression or unequal rights
among nations and corrupting the workers with
nationalist slogans.

“For different nations to live together in peace and
freedom . . . a full democracy, upheld by the work-
ing class, is essential. No privileges for any nation or
any one language! Not even the slightest degree of
oppression or the slightest injustice in respect of a
national minority—such are the principles of work-
ing-class democracy.

“The capitalists and landowners want, at all costs,
to _keep the workers of different nations apart while
the powers that be live splendidly together as share-
holders in proﬁtable concerns involving millions . . .

“Class conscious workers stand for full unity
among workers of all nations in every educational,
trade union, political, etc., workers’ organization.”
Lenin's insight and injunction has lost none of its
relevance:

“The workers of the whole world are building up

their own internationalist culture, which the ‘

champions of freedom and the enemies of oppression
have for long been preparing. To the old world, the
world of national oppression, national bickering, and
national isolation the workers counterpose a new
world, a world of the unity of the working people of
all nations, a world in which there is no place for any
privileges or for the slightest degree of oppression of
than by man.” . El

Two Kinds of Poison

This struggle against "racism and T‘great. national
chauvinism” is a primary and continuing front of the

struggle for achieving the maximum, revolutionary ~

unity of the American working class and its allies in
the total population. Without making decisive
progress on this front, we will be eclipsing the future.
We will be delaying it. Therefore, we say the central
task to accomplish, in order to unify the working
class, to make its revolutionary potential realizable,
is the struggle against the mythology of white
supremacy, the division of racism.

Accompanying this responsibility is a second vital
necessity. This concerns primarily the consciousness
of those components of the American working class,
and those components of the iunfree strata of the
population that we ubiquitously refer to as the
national minorities. That‘ is, the peoples who are
among the oppressed categoriesof ‘our population,
identiﬁed by nationality.

Among ethnically-identiﬁed oppressed nationali-
ties backward ideological trends arise to oppose the
progressive essence of the national liberation thrust
of the movement of the oppressed peoples. There is
an inversion of racism that manifests itself as petty
bourgeois nationalism. Petty bourgeois nationalism
in its consequences is not equal in weight to great
nation, great power nationalism or chauvinism or
racism. But it is no less a divisive factor. It is noless an
alien doctrine and -practice. It doesn’t take a lot of
poison to kill. Whether you take a quart or a
teaspoon full, a potent poison can kill. If we say white
supremacy and racism, great nation or great power
chauvinism is the quart of poison, then petty
bourgeois nationalism—which is the reflection of
bourgeois ideology on I the psychology, and, rep-

resents an ideological" distortion of consciousness ‘

operating among. the oppressed minorities (oppres-
sed nationalities)—would be likened to a teaspoon of
poison: what difference does it make to the corpse?!
What difference does it make if it died-from a
teaspoon or a quart of poison! Therefore, Com-
munists are concerned with eradicating all alien
ideological trends and inﬂuences which operate to
divide the working class and thereby paralyze its
potential for. struggle, divert its revolutionary ener-
gies, waste its revolutionary commitment.

How does Lenin address the question of petty
bourgeois nationalism, the nationalism that operates
among the oppressed nationalities themselves?

Lenin said in The Question of Nationalities or
Autonomization, “What is important for the prole-'

tarian? For the proletarian it is not only important, it
is essential that he should be assured that the non-
Russians place the greatest possible trust in the
proletarian class struggle. What is needed to ensure
this is not -merely formal equality. One way or
another, by- one’s attitude or. by concessions, it is
necessary. to. compensate the non-Russians for
the lack of trust, -for the suspicion and the
insults to which the government of the ‘domi-
nant’ nation subjected them in the past.” And
then Lenin goes ‘on to say, “Nothing holds up the
development and strengthening of class solidarity so
much as national injustice; offended nationals are not

sensitive to anyt_hing so much as to the feeling of '

equality andthe‘ violation of this equality, if only
through negligence of jest by their proletarian
comrades. That isvwhy, in this case, it is bet_ter to
overdo, rather than underdo the concessions and
leniency towards the national minorities. That is
why, in this case, the fundamental interests of
proletarian solidarity and- consequently of the pro-
letarian class struggle, requires -that we never adopt a
formal attitude to the national question, but always

take into _account the specific attitude of the

proletarian of the oppressed or (small) nation toward
the oppressor or (great nation).” (Collected Works,
Vol. 36, pp. 608-609.) In this way Lenin addresses
himself to the proletariat of the dominant or the
oppressor people and its vanguard reﬂection. This is
their obligation. .

At the same time, the corollary to this as applied to
the oppressed nationalities and their vanguard
representatives, the Communists of the oppressed
nationalities, is to avoid like the plague the abso-
lutizingqof the national she1l—t.he abuse of national
pride, of national identity, abuse of national culture
and national distinction permitting it to be utilized by
the bourgeoisie.

The National and the International _
Marxism has a ﬁxed position on nationalism of all
varieties.  points out the following_ in The
_ Nationalist Boagey of Assimilation. -( Collected
Works, ‘Vol. 28.) Thereare two tendencies in the .
national. question. One is the tendency of the
separation of nations,‘ the separation of peoples. This 7
S is to be. observed in the ﬁrststage of the social
development ofcapitalism. Then, as the class struggle
approaches the socialist revolution, as capitalism
develops into its higher stage, the primary tendency is
the tendency of the merger, of the pulling together,
convergence, of nations. These are two tendencies in
the national question, separation and merger. They
are dialectical tendencies. Both of these tendencies
are universal laws of capitalism. .
AMarxism-Leninism in reference to the nationa
question keeps in focus the future historic devel-
opments of the given nationality. The historic
tendency that is .dominant, and, therefore, the
ultimate historic destiny of nations is toward their
convergence and their merger. Communism, as such,
means world community, community of brotherly,
sisterly peoples. A great community of nations all
enjoying equality, all enjoying the fulfillment -of their
respective national development. The national shell
must never be absolutized. The national shell has its
day, like the shell of a chicken when it’s an embryo.
But a certain point is reached when the shell stands in
the way of the further development of the chicken,
and the national shell" in the way of the free
development of peoples. -
Therefore, we can say today—in the 60th anniver-
sary year of the Soviet Union——that the Soviet
Union, though a hundred nationalities strong, is
progressively becoming defined as a great new
socialist/ communist community of peoples. A new
historic race, so to speak, emerging out of the '
conditioning impact and inﬂuence of a socialist
environment under the patronage of the working
class in power, in which there is pooled and merged
all that is progressive and creative from the cultures
of one hundred peoples, that is becoming the shared
common heritage of these hundred peoples. There-
fore, Soviet people are emerging as a new kind of
human being, the heir of all the multi-national
contributions. Therefore, national egotism, national .
arrogance is giving way to‘a snirit of mutual respect ,

and mutual enrichment,‘ one by the other.‘ i _g
The national question is always the playground ._of

the bourgeoisie, even in the first phase of struggle for .

solution of the question when its national form and
national structure have historic justification and
significance, and the national struggle is a legitimate,
more or less independent, phase of the total world
revolutionary process of three components. Nation-
alism is always the playground of the bourgeoisie and
nationalism is the polar opposite of internationalism.
You arrive at the polar opposite. of internationalism
dialectically, true enough, through the ﬁrst phase, so-
called progressive phase, of the national struggle
because each struggle takes place, for a certain phase,
within" the national shell’ before the national shell
becomes a barrier to further struggle. It is necessary
to liberate the chick ‘into the barnyard of the world,
the international working-class arena, so to speak,
and out of its national shell. ’
Ma-‘rxism-Leninism reminds us that the main
function of nationalism, whatever its form, is to split,
divide and fragment the international working class
and the advanced contingents of the national
liberation movement. Capitalist ideologists and pol-
iticians today are increasingly utilizing nationalism

as a means of weakening and dividing the revolution- '

ary movement. By the same token, Communists have
the obligation of raising higher and higher the banner
of proletarian internationalism and all of its col-
lateral expressions, e.g.——interracial solidarity, inter-
national solidarity, intercultural solidarity. The
culture of the proletariat is international; the politics
of the proletariat is international; the ideology of the
proletariat is international. Indeed, without pro-
letarian culture and ideology and politics, it is
impossible to fulfill the objectives which are freedom
and equality, the objectives of the national liberation
movement itself. This is so for any people in any
country.

Marxism and Assimilation

As we said, it is basic to Marxism to renounce all
special privileges for one’s own nation or nationality,
and to demand equality,‘ mutual respect—not domi-
nance. The principle of intemationalism and un-
compromising struggle against the contamination of
the proletariat with bourgeois nationalism, even of
the most refined kind, even of oppressed minorities,
even of oppressed peoples is inviolate.

5

No evasion of the Marxist attitude on the national
question is permissible by any Communist regardless
of nationalityand regardless of the circumstance of
the nationality from which one comes, be it from
oppressed or oppressor peoples.. It is an abuse of
national pride and it is a distortion of a sound
ideological vigilance in struggling against great
nation chauvinism to scorn or cast aspersions on the
concept of assimilation.

Ultimately the solution of the national question
will result in the historic merger of nations and
nationalities. No peoples will march under their
national ﬂag into communism. They will check their
national ﬂag at the doorand there will emerge a new
historic people that represents the best from each.

. Communists, as the vanguard of this process, already
have this notion‘ present ideologically in their
conceptions». Listen to what Lenin says:

‘.‘Whoever does not recognize and champion the
equality of nations and languages, and does not fight
against" all national oppression or inequality, is not a
Marxist; he is not even a democrat. That_is beyond
doubt. But it is also beyond doubt that the pseudo-.

- Marxist who heaps abuse upon a Marxist of another
nation for being an ‘assimilator’ is simply a
nationalist philistine.” That’s the way Lenin put the
question in his article— The Nationalist Boogey of
Assimilation. Victory of the working class, “the
genuine democratic force . .. . would make national
oppression of all of its kinds impossible.” But the

. condition for victory is unity, “across all nationaland
racial lines. With such unity, national freedom is
possible” Lenin taught. But “without such unity, it is.
out of the question.” To forge unity is an obligation
not only of the advanced conscious forces of the
oppressor peoples, but it is the also the duty and the
responsibility of the Communists, of the working-
class forces of the oppressed, to fight against petty
bourgeois nationalism. Of course, it is the duty of all
to fight against “great nation” nationalism or
chauvinism, against racism and white supremacy.
The force that deliberately makes it possible .. to
deliver oppressed nationalities from their oppressed
status, and to attain real equality and freedom, is
precisely that strategic alliance with the strategic class

which is multinational, multiracial——the working
class. As Lenin stressed in respect to the Ukrainian

question, “the proletarian cause must come ﬁrst -

because "it not only protects the lasting and funda-
mental interests of labor and of humanity, but also
those of democracy and, without democracy, neither
an autonomous nor an independent Ukraine is
conceivable.”

Then, again, “If a Ukrainian Marxist allows
himself to be swayed by his quite legitimate and
natural hatred of the Great Russian oppressdrs, if
he allows himself to be swayed to such a degree that
he transfers even a particle of this hatred, even if it be
only estrangement to the proletarian culture and the
proletarian cause of the Great Russian workers, then
such a Marxist will get bogged down in bourgeois
nationalism.”

What is bourgeois nationalism? I? is a concession
to the bourgeoisie and a~ confrontation with the

workers of ' the oppressor people. The strategic
solution to solving the emancipatory, historic task
for the deliverance of the people. from the prison
house of imperialism, both as a class and as an
oppressed nationality, precisely requires the strategic

_ alliance between the oppressed people and the

working-class strata of the dominant oppressor
people. This is the law of Leninism, the law of
revolution according to Lenin. A

“All advocacy of the segregation of the workers of i

one nation from those of another, all attacks upon
Marxists as ‘assimilation,’ or attempts, where the
proletariat is concerned, to counterpose one national
culture as a whole to another, allegedly integral
national culture, and so forth, is bourgeois national-
ism, against which it is essential to wage a ruthless
struggle.”

No Conciliation on Principle

In our Party we do not and will never conciliate,
compromise, coexist with non-Leninist, anti-Marxist
ideological concepts, whether it is the nationalism of
chauvinism and racism (great power nationalism) or
the nationalism which is an inversion of great power
nationa1ism—the nationalism of bourgeois nation-
alism and/ or of the petty bourgeois nationalist
variety as manifested by some currents among the
oppressed peoples themselves. The great scholar, Dr.

W.E.B. DuBois said, “The first concession that the '

oppressor bourgeoisie gives to the oppressed is the
7

equal right to do wrong and this is an objective that i
we are duty bound not to struggle for, the equal right.
to do wrong.” Therefore, this we will never accept, no —

compromises on ideological questions. But, on
tactical questions, yes, we will compromise. On
principled ideological questions—no. Therefore, it is
never correct to adopt any position which suggests
that we have a scoffer’s attitude at international,
inter-racial relationships. V

We would not be so thin skinned or silly as to
reduce the struggle on the principled question of
national liberation to a dispute over “words on a
signpost.” It is not terms, but what terms signify that
we are concerned with. Nevertheless, Communists
must always be vigilant and sensitive not to use terms
that tend to drive a wedge, to widen areas of
suspicion, mistrust and divorcement among working
people along the color line, along the cultural line,
along the national and religious lines which exist in
our working class. Our responsibility is, with
grappling hooks of ideology and commitment to our
goal, to work to close the hiatus, the divisions, the
spaces between the national components which fill
the river of the U.S. working class. Without doing so,
without integrating and assimilating this working
class in a common class objective and toward a
common goal, we will never attain a common
objective. It is the obligation of Communists, both
white and non-white Communists, each from his own
perspective, his own starting point, to make sub-
stantial contributions toward this end.

We have an obligation in the use of language and
the use of examples to illustrate valid and sound
points to take due care that we do not add to the
division but that we contribute to raising conscious-
ness of the necessity to close divisions, manifestly still
present in the riverbed of the multi-national, multi-
racial working class of our country, the largest
component of which is white. This we must under-
stand: it is no service to the cause of struggle against
racism, to the struggle for national working class
unity, for whites to sheer away from addressing
themselves with confidence to the prejudices that
exist among the white workers, i.e., the white
Communists to the white workers in general.

But all have observed situations in leaﬂet distri-
butions or newspaper canvassing that some white
comrades will take the side of the street or town
where Blacks live. Out of what? Out of fear, out of
rejection of the white workers. This is impossible and .
intolerable and not a sign of greater understanding or
commitment to a struggle for class "unity, but an
avoidance of that struggle. We have conﬁdence in the
working class. If we do not, we belong to another
organization. We have conﬁdence in the white
workers, who constitute numerically the majority of
the working class in the USA. It is unthinkable
that we are going to get socialism without the white
workers. And the obligation of all Communists, no
matter what their color or their nationality, is to
address white workers. There is ice in the river of the
white masses of the working class, but there is more
than the ice of prejudice there, and the sun of
Marxist-Leninist reason and of necessity itself will
crumble and melt that ice. Only then will the
torrential revolutionary power in the riverbed of that
working class be released, only on the basis of
addressing the ice flows of prejudice that clog the
ﬂow of the river can we win. And that is every
Communist’s -duty.

lntermarriage: An Index

Some unfortunate formulations get into our dis-
cussions and unfortunate points of reference which,
I’m sure, after reﬂection we would not repeat. We are
for not only the liberation of all peoples and their
attainment of equality and parity with all other
peoples, but, we are for the great world community of
peoples, equal peoples. Consequently, we are for the
merger, the convergence of nations and peoples,
nationalities, and for the removal of all the fences
that hem people in and isolate brother and sister from
brother and sister the world around, regardless of
language and so forth. Therefore, we are, in our
personal attitudes and our personal assessments.
integrationists, assimilationists; we are Communists.

We ﬂy under the banner of internationalists and,
therefore, we have to have an attitude inour personal
definitions, as well as in our understanding of the
essence and thrust in Marxism-Leninism in the
