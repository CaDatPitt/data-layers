PUNCHIN' OUT WITH

_ Thus,§the conditions are ripen-
ing for a battle over nationaliza-
tion. The objective motion toward
nationalization is based on the
fact that the costs of modernization
have grown beyond the ability of
any single steel giant to finance
them. It is based on the fact
that the economy must have steel
and yet the steel companies will
not produce it unless they are
guaranteed.a healthy profit. Under
such circumstances, the govern-
ment (ever the reliable partner),
often buys up an industry or a
portion of it and operates it
at the taxpayers‘ expense. This
does not benefit the workers
involved as the government-
strives to produce the product
or service as cheaply as possible
in order to cut costs for the
corporate purchaser. \

Take a look at what happene
with Conrai1.. Whenrinvestors mm
pulled their money out of Penn
Central in l970,'it went bankrupt.
The government had to step in
because the operation Of that
huge rail network was necessary
for the economy to function.
They bought Penn Central and
turned it into Conrail. We are
still paying for it.‘ On 12/1/80
the government announced that
it would pay yet another $2.1
billion of our money to the Penn

if Central Corporation, the energy
and real estate company that rose

out of the railroad's ashes.

Now that the taxpayers have
upgraded much of the former Penn
Central track and rolling stock,
there is a clamor from the
private railroads to give it back
when Conrail's mandate expires in
1981. s

This type of nationalization
1S essentially what haPPened
with British steel and it is
qujte possible that some U.S.
steel companies would accept
a similar deal. We cannot let

‘that happen.

Neﬁﬂmr should we have any
interest in a "nationalization"
such as the one which took
place in the United States in
1952. On April 8 of that year
President Truman seized the
mills during a contract dispute

 on the" gi-‘6imds“ "'th‘at* ' i‘t“"W‘a”§’-?~~ ~—~¥  

necessary to insure production
for the Korean War.£;;t_wa§/.
later revealed that there had
been a surplus of war material.
Truman's real motives were to
insure cheap steel for the
rebuilding of Europe (wages
were frozen during the take-
over even though the contract
had long since expired) and

to blunt the growing strength
of the USWA by forcing it to '
directly confront the govern-
ment and the state.

Steel mill shutdowns have once again
taken center stage in the ever lengthen-
ing cast of economic and social problems ‘
facing Pittsburgh and the tri-state area.

Recent events in Youngstown, Ohio in

the wake of_a series of plant shutdowns
indicate that a growing number of people
are looking for alternatives to the loss
of jobs, community destabilization and
dislocation associated with plant clos-
ings. Pittsburgh, with her large indus-
trial sector, would do well to explore
all economic options, including community/
worker ownership, before shutdowns make
this town an industrial graveyard.

Community/worker ownership of com-
panies in America is not only a possibi-
lity on the horizon, but a reality in
1981. More than 1,000 firms presently‘
h3Ve some form of worker ownership aside
from profit sharing trusts. Sears,
Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest
retailer is more than 20 percent worker
owned. Other well known companies with
significant worker ownership include
ATT, Proctor & Gamble, J.C. Penney and
Eastman Kodak.

Pittsburgh should
explore community/

worker ownership before
shutdowns make this

town an industrial A

graveyard.

Steel Millshutdowns

  A Case for
o C ommunity/ Worker
Ownership

by Howard Scott, Jr.

Production cooperatives, the category
steel would fall under, have existed and
competed with private companies in the
plywood, shingle barrelmaking and foundry
industries and many others during the last
one hundred years.

Plywood cooperatives have controlled
10 to 20 percent of the plywood market
_since l9h5. Shingle and barrelmaking are
diminishing crafts in America, but during
their high water mark, these two indus-
tries were frequently cooperative enter-
prises. I -

Foundry cooperatives were common in
the days when Vulcans and Blacksmiths
produced their molten products on a much
smaller basis. Small foundrys diminished
with the introduction of extremely expen-
sive machinery to meta1_industries, and
subsequent increased-productivity, but
there is a cooperative presence in the
history of metal manufacturing in America.

  A more responsive
‘shop floor’ management
can overcome  
”unprofitabiIity" of
’ factories if given
a fighting chance.

What do these cooperatives have to
do with the shutdown of huge steel mills?
Many people in Youngstown's Mahoning
Valley'and in other parts of the country
believe their mills, or parts of their
mills can be profitably reopened under a
cooperative arrangement. They feel that
a more responsive ‘shop floor‘ type of
management coupled with the spirit of

community necessity can overcome"unprofi-,

tability" of their factories if given a
fighting chance.

In Youngstown, a group of religious,
trade union, small business and other
concerned citizens commissioned the
‘National Center for Economic Alternatives
to study the economic feasibility of re-
opening Youngstown Sheet and Tube's

" ~v;‘\w-rv-vr---«“'

.. . ./ _.,..,...,...l,.w_...m........................r....

Campbell Works, which had just laid off
b,l00 workers. The results of their
study were extremely promising. The plan
to reopen the shutdown mill is contingent‘
on raising enough money to retool the
-dilapidated plant. ’

Steel production requires large cap-
ital investments to keep machinery modern,
operating and profitable. Herein lies
the problem metal manufacturing faces
that other potentially cooperative enter-
prises don't - a sizable pool of opera-
ting capital. C.

A food cooperative doesn't require
much in the way of machinery aside from
transportation. Rural-electric coops
don't need much capital improvement be-
yond the initial investments. Metal pro-
ducing cooperatives must be able to main-
tain a lot of equipment aside from labor..

This is where community investment
fits into the picture . If a large enough
group in an industrial community are wil-
ling to buy stock in a cooperative enter-
prise, with the understanding that they
will be involved in the plant's management
the chance for that cooperative to survive
is much better.

Three and a half million dollars
were collected in the Youngstown area from
people interested in creating a community/
workers steel cooperative from the shut-'

.down Campbell Works. This was an incredi-

ble economic response from a community

' with one of the highest unemployment

rates in the country. The United Steel-
workers of America show great interest

in the cooperative idea and so did the
Jimmy Carter White House, at first. Tax
payers and the government were already
footing a large bill in unemployment
benefits, among other things, as a re-‘
sult of the plant closing and any plans
~to revitalize theeconomically sick Mahon-
ing Valley were of interest.

But when the cards were laid on
the table, and Carter saw he would have
to make a modest public loan to put the
cooperative plan into action, he squint-
ed his left eye, threw in his hand and
folded.

Fred Wright, Union Cartoons

‘ " lsay that labor and management must cooperate,
Management gives the orders and labor cooperates
byobeying them..." ‘

The Campbell Works, like many
steel mills, was not modernized during
its final years of activity, and required
a lot of improvement in order to become
competitive. Workers‘ bonuses at Young-
stown Sheet & Tube were tied to cost
savings in the shops. This provided an
incentive for workers not to report worn
equipment. when the shutdown announce-
ment was made, much of the plant's mach-
inery had already outlived its usefulness.

N.C.E.A.‘s economic feasibility
study showed that the plant's reopening
would require more money than the people
in the Mahoning Valley were able to come
up with, and in an unresponsive banking
community, government loans were the
best bet. Progressive Democratic and
Republican congressmen supported the
cooperative plan and publicly urged Car-
tter to break with the tradition of pro-
viding loans to traditionally managed
companies. '

Although the loans never came
through for Youngstown, the idea of a
democratically-run steel cooperative is
still alive in the Mahoning Valley. A
survey of citizens in that area showed
an 89% approval rating for the coalition
that pushed for a community/workers steel
cooperative.

 

 

We are capable of
running steel mills that
we have built. Our
community is worth it.

Indications are that Pittsburgh will
face the same problems as Youngstown and
the Mahoning Valley in the near future.
we must prepare for future shutdowns with
intelligence, pride, vigor and the spirit
of democracy. We should become familiar
with present community/worker enterprises
and educate ourselves with the full un-
derstanding that we are capable of run-

.ning the steel mills that we have built.

Our community is worth it.

der cooperative management of one sort or

Tri-State Conference Fights for Milltowns

There are a lot of
things I remember seeing
as'a young boy, but none
is as vivid as the people
and\the places I saw
while looking out the
back window of our old-
blue Chevy wagon. ‘

We had one of those
station wagons with the
back seat facing the
opposite way. .While my
parents saw life coming
at them, I noticed life
as it was passing me by.

These back seat rides
took me to visit my
grandparents and cousins.
And on the way we passed
through many small mill
towns. The names, Home-
stead, Duquesne, and
Hazelwood, are familiar

A to me now, but back then

I could only distinguish
the towns by the differ-
ent colors of smoke that
hovered over each com-
munity. ' A

From the back seat,
the dark clouds of smoke
preceded. the enormous
red chimneys of the mill.

i’.My sister always noticed

the dreadful smell,'buti
I enjoyed Just watching.

I saw men carrying their
silver lunch boxes down
the hill and over the
tracks to the mill, but.I
never saw their faces.
From the back seat, the
men would always be
walking away from me.
They would walk by, but’
they never seemed to go
anyplace, until they
disappeared into the red

dskies that engulfed

the town.

As the years went by, I
igraduated from the back
seat to the front seat of
the station wagon, and to
the front seat of the Nova,
and the Granada, and even
to the front seat of my
very own Mustang. And
now I can view life coming
at me. C

The smoky skies are
receding, so the men with
the silver lunch boxes
now have faces. These
faces, however, are appear-
ing in the newspapers, and
in the unemployment lines.

.‘ Another plant closes. Red
skies disappear. The faces

warned that preparation
must begin now if the Mon

U.S. Steel decides to
leave.

"We had the opportunity~
to gain attention to our

we blew it. Because we
weren't prepared and we
lost the moment," said
~Rawlings. "We've got to

As U.S. Steel continues
to close more mills, the

' growing line of faces has

become a great concern to
the Tri-State Conference on
Steel.

‘The organization is
composed of steelworkers,
union leaders, members of
the clergy, and concerned
community leaders. They
have dedicated themselves
to educating the comunities
about ways to influence
economic decisions which
will affect all of us.

I became acquainted with
the Tri-State Conference

meeting at St. Stephens
Church in Hazelwood. Several
members of the Youngstown

’area were there to offer

advice on how to educate
the community on what is

were present at the
meeting of the beginning
of what is hoped to be
the collaboration of the
entire Mon Valley in pre-
paration for imminent
plant closings.

The feeling expressed at
the meeting was that U.S.
Steel has no regard for
the welfare of the steel

down. ‘

Mike "Kentucky" Stout, an
unemployed steel worker, is
one of the vocal organ-
izers of the Tri State
Conference. .Stout claimed
that U.S. Steel owes the
communities of the Mon
Valley and that they must
take care of the people of
the steel towns when they
decide to pack up and
leave.

"For more than 100 years,

iU.S. Steel and J&L have

sucked the blood out of the
steelworkers, many who have
died without anything,"
argued Stout. "They don't
have the right to pack up
and leave. They have to
reinvest the money back
into the community that
they raped."

Stout went on to say

that the people of the Mon
Valley should have a say

in what decisions are made
regarding the closing of

a mill. And if U.S. Steel
does decide to leave,

"they better damn well have
the people prepared."

"They must provide health
insurance for the un-
employed steelworker. They
must retrain the employee
for another position. And

I I

they better pay the people?
added Stout.

As the meeting adjourned
for lunch, I remained
seated. I tried to con-
vince myself that this
organization wasn't just
wasting their time. I
wanted to helieve that
they could fight their
powerful enemy, U.S. Steel,
and win. But not even I,

a writer who often imagines
the impossible, could bring
myself to put my money on

,these underdogs.

I thought again of the
faces in the unemployment
lines that have accepted
their ‘ate. Whey realize
that they can't fight the
enemy, and they seem con-
tent to accept the
possibility of more weeks
of unemployment and hard-
ship. They have accepted

/1

the fact that they can't
fight back. But I wonder
if they can accept the
prospect that they might
not survive... a

After lunch the group
separated into four
committees: the Economic
Survival committee, the
Research and Reindustrial-
ization committee, the
Political Action committee,
and the Education
committee.

T joined the Education
committee which consisted
of about ten people.

There was a steelworker, a
miner, a teacher, an exec-
utive, a railroader, and
members of the clergy.

We were very much different
from each other.

When we introduced our-
selves, I hecame aware of
one surprising fact. None

Life as a Tool Maker

by Mike F. Holodnak

My life as a tool and die
maker\was a fairly unhappy one.
I began it at age 16 and

found the trade interesting
and challenging and every

day I was learning something
new. After several years I
became a skilled craft person
and the challenges, though
they varied widely, were be-
coming routine and my interest
in the trade began to diminish.

As for my fellow tool

‘makers, who were fairly

intelligent people, I found
it difficult to get into a
stimulating discussion with
them because they knew
practically nothing about the
world around them.

They, more than other work-
ers, gave their full support
to McCarthyism, they hated
Castrofs Cuban revolution,
supported the Vietnam war and
they were racists, and they not
only hated unions, but boasted
that they have never walked a
picket line in their lives.

In short they were victims of
the system, full of misinfor-
mation.
they had a special skill with
better than average pay and
they looked down on production
workers as being beneath them.
The working class struggle
meant nothing to them.

But the thing they had that
other workers did not have was
the attitude that they were
aristocrats. ‘

It was this attitude more
than anything else that led me
to change jobs frequently.

I not only changed jobs but I
took on a wide variety of jobs
that were totally unrelated

to tool making.

I found that workers on the
whole were not all hardnosed
conservatives - although a good

All they knew was that "

many were. Most of them had

18

some form of political conscious-

ness that ranged from limited
knowledge to rare well-read
radicals.

All along the way I kept‘
wondering how it was possible
for so many millions of workers
to be oppressed and exploited
by so few wealthy people.

This burning desire to want
to know the whys and wherefores
of this strange phenomenon led.
me to reading books.
about economics, different
social and economic
ious fields in science, philos-

I read books

systems, var-

mmw. psychology, the humanities,

astronomy and everything else

that made up our universe.
The consequences were that

I have grown to be a radical.
In all my years as a union

shop steward in a large aircraft

plant my radicalization was
very beneficial in my success-
ful prosecution of grievances
against the company. I have
been on many union picket _
lines, some of which had been
attacked by police violence,

and in many peace demonstrations

etc. I was doing my bit to
help change the system. This
gave my life some meaning and
I was happy and at peace with
myself. ‘
But now that I'm disabled

~by arthritis I regret very much

not being able to participate
actively in the final offensive

' that will route out all the

gangsters in power.

Yet my wife, Stephanie, and
I feel that the Ronald Reagan
pro-business and anti-people
administration will bring on
a people's revolution sooner
than anyone may think and we ‘
will at least witness it as
we had personally witnessed
the Cuban revolution in 1960.

the machinery of mass production
intensified human greed, hardly_
new, but a necessary element.
with the greed for an ever-
increasing array of commodities,
mass producers such as Volkswageni
of America can lure workers to
greater depths of human degra-
dation with illusive promises

of financial success.» The worker,
never the design of the work,

.Through mass production,
xindustrialism, the western

world has been transformed

into a single insatiable
-appetite for goods and services;
it is a gaping wound to human '
dignity; it reduces humankind. '
to a series of programmed
produce-consume reflexes.

Historically mass production
depended on a constant supply
of disposable people--resources

Ito be exploited then discarded
. in sanitariums, detox units,

nursing homes. Like the giant
landfills bordering the city,
these people are bulldozed under
along with tons of fetal garbage
because the lesson of industrial-
ized society is human life is‘
not only expendable, but this
sloughing off, this extermination,
is economically essential.

With this pool of workers,
contemporary society offers

is questioned when someone quits
out of desperation.

Tragically the nature of this
work has already become
acceptable, approved without
question; Mass production per-
meates every facet of contem-
porary life; it's hardly confined
to building automobiles., Gradually
the idea of a mass society has
come to mean a productive society.

The truth made popular in this g
age: I consume, I'm economically
active; therefore I am, is '
destined to become the society's
epitaph. ’ .

Whether drawn to the job by
greed or necessity, the produc-
tion worker experiences a sense
of futility about bettering '
working conditions. This resig-
nation, this apathy poisons the
human spirit. The worker is then
prepared to substitute jackets,
earrings and belt buckles bearing
the company emblem for genuine
pride in one's work.

After all, life goes on, right?

I don't look back at the
Volkswagen plant as I leave for
the last time.

Well Ernie, we may all soon
be glowin' in the dark with you
if the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission has its way. The NRC
is in the process of deregula-
ting their disposal of radio-
actively contaminated metal
from nuclear power plants. Be-

possibility of using something
in our daily lives made from
radioactive scrap metal.

Recently Eric Leif Davin,
editor of City Times and .
Weekly Reader, interviewed
Tony Novelsel a steelworker at
Steel Met Corporation, a scrap
metal processing plant,about
this possibility.

;Tony. I work in an industrial
iscrapyard that processes nickel
copper, iron, steel, and pre-
gcious alloys in a small plant
_located in Port Vue, Pa. We
ould eventually be effected
by any of these deregulations.

Eric. You might be handling
____
some~of this radioactive metal?

Tony. It's a good possibility.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion has put forth proposals

as of October 27, 1980, to de-
regulate smelted scrap alloys
hat contain amounts of TC 99
and low-enriched uranium. In

he long run this would deregu-
late radioactive scrap and

it could be put on the market

 

Scrapyard Radiation B/Mues

without anyone knowing that’
they're even buying the radio-
active scrap. Steel mills,andv
industrial scrap Yards which _
recycle scrap metal would not
even know'that the metal was
:radioactive._This would be ,~
reused into automobiles; home
appliances, furniture, utensils,
personal items and coinsf

The only way to stop these ~
proposals is for sme group or
organization or individual to

try to get a restraining order «
from the courts. /

Eric. I'm sure one of the
pthings’they're saying is that
the amount of radioactivity is,
_so minimal that it's no health
hazard at all. How dangerous is
this activity? ”

K)HN-‘COLLINS l
Cuunnx Mnnnrul (Can I Guzrllf .

DR_ JEKYLL ahdx MR HIDE-3 / ‘

Tony. The environmental impact
report that the NRC put out V _
admits, and I'm quoting here, . ~x g
that the report "does not ade- _
quately describe the'contamina-i ' ‘
tion levels of either scrap i ‘A ’
input or the,smelted metal. ,
Furthermore, it does not ade-
quately describe sampling pro-
cedures and the degree of as-
surance which it might give

in the presence of hot spots."

What this means is that they

active metal with non-radioaca
tive metal and scrap steel and-
put that back into society.
This will cover mickel, copper,
iron and steel,and the sheet
steel that goes into cars. So
your car could have levels of
radiation. In the canned food
you buy, the can could have ,
low levels of radiation. If _
these deregulations go through,
the only people who have to
have a license to work with
the radioactive metal would be
the people who smelt it or buy
it initially. Once the metal
is smelted there is no proce-
dure of licensing to stop any-
one from buying or using this
metal that has radioactivity
in it.

Once this metal leaves the
yard where it is being stored,
there's no way for anyone to
know what they're buying or
using. The mills in this area
could use radioactive scrap
and never know it.‘

Eric. ‘ i a
Does this mean that you coul

be walking around with a radio-
active nickel in your pocket or
a radioactive spoon in your
mouth? a
Tony. ’
Right. You could have a car
that might glow in the dark!

Eric. How did this metal be-
come radioactive in the first
place?

 

 

EﬂTT1HBEl1MC1ﬂUﬂE 1N3I1!J!
THAN RADIOACTIVE TOMORROW

Tony. This metal has been used
in nuclear power plants —- in
the pipes for the cooling water
and for radioactive fuel. From
a plant that has been decommis-
sioned or rebuilt, this metal
might have been in touch with
radioactive material.

Eric. Why would anyone want to
recycle this metal anyway?

Tony. The NRC proposal states
that the net benefit for en;
riched plant scrap would be
$1+1.6 million to the govern.»
ment. By selling the scrap
they would get this profit.
Also, radioactive waste burial
costs could be avoided and new
metal would not have to be pro-
duced. So it comes down to
pure economics —— they want to
make some money.

Eric. Who exactly is "they"?

Tony. The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission itself.

Eric. If someone is interested
in doing something about this,
what .can they do?

Tony. You can contact the Union
of Concerned Scientists, l38h
Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge,
Massachusetts, 02238, phone
number -- 617-5h7—5552.
To get in touch with the

Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
you write to J. J. Henry, Office

of the Standard Development,
Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, D.C., 20555.

Anyone who's interested .
could also get involved with
a local organization or local
unions and take a stand on this.

by Eric W. Sedlak

Early in the morning on August 4, 1980, I
received a call from Nhnpower Temporary Services
asking me to report for work as soon as possible at
a heating and cooling company in Canonsburg.
"Finally," I thought to myself, "I'll have some work
ans some money." I hastily ate my breakfast,
seized the family car, and was soon busy at work
cleaning corroded aluminu sheets with some sort
of smelly liquid.

At 3 P.M. on the third day, my fellow Manpower
.employee and I were chatting with the boss as we
moved some freezer cases out of a flooded storage
building. I casually asked the boss (since we
were in Canonsburg) where that industrial park
with all that buried atomic waste was. He informed
me that I was standing on it. '

I was taken aback for a moment, considering
the vision of little Eric W. Sedlaks with no arms.

I started to talk to my co-worker about it,
emphasizing the cancer risks. "Screw it," he said,
"everyting causes cancer."

"Not like radioisotopes," I replied.

I phoned Manpower as soon as I got home. I asked
the woman who answered what the risks of working’
on the site were, explaining them to her as I went
along. The woman admitted that she didn't know too
much about the hazards, but entioned that Manpower
hadn't realized that we were being sent to the .
contaminated industrial park in Canonsburg. She

»told me that she would bring the matter to the
attention of her supervisor, and that I should call
back the next day to speak to him about it. How
comforting it was to know that I had been only
inadvertantly_irradiated. ‘

en I spoke with the supervisor, he told me
that he'd checked into it, and that the stuff had
been buried over fifty years ago. (Some of it;

Vitro Metals stopped dumping in the late 1950's).
I asked him if he knew what a half-life was, and
told him how long some isotopes can last. I also
asked what we could do about our exposure. Man-
power told me that if I felt I was being forced
to work in unsafe conditions, I was free to walk
off the job. I knew that this meant without pay.
It sounded like the best of Henry Clay Frick and
J.P. Stevens. Disgusted by his ignorance, I
thanked him politely and hug up.

Because I needed the money,

 Alpha Radiation in my socks

’ ‘T ” I stayed through that day and the next, to the
2 end of my assignment. It was an awful choice to have
to make, but I fear that I was only one of thousands
'3‘ 5- -, \ of workers in similar situations, and that my lot
'“"";33L-~;. was considerably better than that of most of the
IE rest, including those who work regularly at that
;j industrial park.
:5 * The United States Department of Energy says of
,§ ’ these workers, "People working in these facilities
5: did not knowingly incur such radiation exposures and
,,s‘ are receiving no benefits from their involutary
exposures to radiation; the risk of_cancer may be
elevated somewhat by these exposures." The report
__ . further states that the risks imposed on those one
A§' _ .f=.' ! hundred twenty-five workers are ”uwarranted”.
43' , The original sin, as it were, was committed by the
_ g’ Vitro Rare Metals Company, which operated on the
,_i=ﬁ::%-~ ‘ j k... -***—-—L.; site for almost fifty years. From 1911 to 1922, the .

- “ ‘ 2'1 ‘ "~ company extracted radium from carnotite ore. From
1930 to 1942, radim and uranium salts were separated
from on-site residues, which were apparently of
sufficient purity and potency to make this feasible, ‘“
as well as from carnotite ore. During this period,

a gift of radiu was presented to Marie Curie, who
had discovered the element. In the third phase, ur-
anium was recovered from ores and scrap materials,
from 1942 until the end of operations in 1957. It
is ruoured that some of this uraniu was used for
the Manhattan Project.

To the fim's credit, it did some monitoring in
the late 1940's and early 1950's. Although these
studies indicated that hazardous conditions might
exist because of above average radiation, Vitro Rare
Metals did nothing to correct the problem. In 1951,
for example, although uranium concentration was
measured at ten times background level in Chartiers
Creek, no remedial action was taken.

How, one might ask, did the uranium get into the.
creek? Liquid wastes were pumped about two hundred
metres from the main portion of the plant to an
oval area measuring fifty by eighty metres. This
swamp later became a ballfield. Any overflow from
this sup seeped (seeps?) into Chartiers Creek,
which borders the dump site, and then on to the
Ohio River-~and beyond. Radioisotopes are found in
minute quantities, if at all, in the creek. The

How Radon-222 gave me

its daughters

real problem is in the industrial park, and in
adjoining residences. .

Radon gas, radon daughters, and gamma radiation
are the major contaminats to which workers at the
park are exposed. Radon-222 is a rather short-
lived particle, with a half-life of only 3.8 days.
It emits alpha particles, which are large in atomic
terms and cause heavy damage to cells exposed to
them. Radon gas, which comes from decaying radium,
seeps constantly out of drains and cracks. and
builds up in umventilated areas, especially in the
winter. _ I

Radon-222 decays into four other isotopes, which
are its "daughters". These have half-lives of
anywhere from .002 seconds to 27 minutes (the half-
life of the U-238 uder the soil, by contrast, is
4.5 billion years). In addition to alpha particles,
the four daughters, polonium-218, lead-214, bismuth-
214, and polonim-214, also emit beta particles and
gamma radiation, which are generally less harmful-
than alpha particles. DOE found that radon
daughter concentrations were above acceptable levels
in all the buildings, except the one which had been
built after Vitro's purification work had stopped.

Gamma radiation is very penetrating.

To effectively stop it would require a piece of
lead about as thick as one's head. It is very
difficult to provide protection against this form

of radiation, which passes easily through the body,

doing damage as it travels.

I discovered that I had been working in some of
the hotter areas of the site. In some places,
alpha radiation had been measured at up to twelve
times Nuclear Regulatory Commission guidelines.

.On the day I discovered that I was working in "the"

industrial park, I had been walking in water on a
floor where alpha radiation had been three to eight
times as high as allowed by NRC guidelines. In all
likelihood, this means that I was walking aroud
with alpha emitters in my socks for a few hours.
This pleasantry was further shared with my mother
when she did the laudry the next day. It is for-
tunate that my exposure to beta-gamma radiation did
not exceed guidelines.

What surprised me most was how
casual the regular workers are

Y about the whole thing.

What surprised me most was how casual the regular
workers are about the whole thing. Perhaps that is
because they have been told that working in the
park is only moderately dangerous. It is clear that
no one knows which areas are the most dangerous.

One of the worst places is in the office section of
one of the buildings, where several people sit
throughout the day, and where alpha radiation is up
to eighteen times the established guideline. One

the second day I worked in the park, I helped move

a pile of broken concrete. The DOE report revealed
that this seemingly innocuous task let me into direct
contact with uranium at twelve hudred tims the
backgroud level.

Effectively stopping gamma radiation
would require a piece of lead about
as thick as one's head

These seemingly large numbers indicate radiation
which is nowhere strong enough to give anyone
radiation sickness. There is, on the other hand, a
measurable cancer risk. Radon and radon daughter .
concentrations generally exceeded the guidelines for
uraniu.miners, whereas gamma radiation did not.
According to the Surgeon General, exposure to radon
gas at the allowable level for uranium miners for
a year would lead to a four percent increase in the
probability of developing lug cancer. Exposure to
high levels of gamma radiation would lead to an
increase of .l% in the probability of developing
some type of cancer. It is unclear, however, what
implications these increased risks will have,
because the probabilities are estimated and precise
correlations have not been developed. What is
clear is that those who work there are imperiled.

My own chance of developing lug cancer this
year rose by about .1% as a result of my unintended
exposure. I'd prefer never to be exposed again.
But what is to keep random exposures from
happening if no one, neither the employer nor the
worker, uderstands and is made aware of th
dangers? A firm which is ignorant of workplace
hazards is conducting its affairs in a negligent
and plainly irresponsible manner.

Hardly, because the crisis
isn't Iranian or American.
It's what people are willing
to do to one another.

Now that the chauvinistic
Iranians have turned over the
hostages, here we go again.

One hostage calls the Iranians
pigs. Another says he'll go
back only in a B-52. A
hostage's wife calls Iranians
"trash" whom we may "look down
on." The frustration and anger
are natural, but must we act

on it?

And in Washington, REagan

calling Rmssians immoral and
unscrupulous, cheaters and

scariest thing is that REagan,

seems to believe that naive
jingoistic claptrap.

Hitler's Germans looked

\down on Jews and quite a few

other non-Aryans. And Ayatollah
Khomeini calls the U.S. the
Great Satan and refuses to

speak to the inferior Ameri-

American slave in the 19th
century, in federal court was
deemed fundamentally another

man's property, rather than a
dignified human being, while
American Indians were being
called savages. And the rest

Yes, the Iranian terrorists
acted brutally and inhumanely
toward the hostages. But with-
out America's close relation-
ship to the brutal, repressive
and greedy shah, it is unlikely
the Iranians would have initiat-
ed the hostage crisis. The
hostage-taking didn't occur
until after they had experienced
a quarter century of barbaric
oppression and torture at the
hands of the shah. Was the
hostage taking justified?
Hardly. Were the actions of
the American—backed shah justi-
fied? ‘No.

Must we employ brutal or
deadly force to be men? Is
getting our way really more
important than one human life?

Are our cars and TVs. more

If you must blame someone
for the Iranian crisis, blame
Eisenhower, blame Truman be-

loosed the first nuclear holo-
caust on the civilians of

Americans treat oil-rich Iran

could be imprisoned soon.

Perhaps that is not surprising.
Some sages have suggested that ”

El Salvador: Struggle in U.S.34

One of the world's lead-
ing big-business dailies--
the Wall St. Journal--took
up what it called "the
nasty little war in El Sal-
vador" in its lead editor-
ial Feb. h. "What we are

seeing here," the editorial
declared, "is the beginning

of a foreign policy struggle.

between the Reagan adminis-
tration and the American
left"--the Journal's term
for all of the progressive
forces in American society.

"The parallel'to Vietnam
is uncanny," the editorial
complained. It charged
that "the international
left set out to ‘inter-
nationalize‘ the struggle,
using the killings of Amer-1
icans to arouse the United
States."

In the sneering tone that
it uses to convey its con-
tempt for working people
and its hatred for those
who fight for Justice, the
Journal expressed its dis-
may at the appearance Feb.

Call for ”/ncreased Productivity

H 38

Puts Squeeze on Worker

_ Productivity seems to be the catch-
word of the eighties. It was a campaign
slogan of every candidate from Carter
and Kennedy through Reagan all the way
to alternative Anderson. Productivity
is their solution to the current fiscal
crisis. Increasing the amount of goods
and services produced, not only absol-
utely, but increasing the amount that
each American worker produces, every
day.

No one, though, has been talking’
much about how this will be accomplished
There are only a few ways this can be
done. First is to get each worker to
work harder. Perhaps the American
economy is lagging because American
workers are just plain lazy compared to

,their Japanese or European counterparts.

They don't have the same drive or am-
bition anymore, now that they've union-
ized, gotten fat paychecks, or gained
the kind of smug job security that lets
them lay back and just not give a damn.
So to get more for our money, to squeeze
a bit more sweat out of each working day,
we have to convince workers that it's
really in their benefit to take a cut in
pay or real wages, to keep their factory
open. It's the patriotic thing to do.
So what if a few more workers have-
industrial accidents as the push for
productivity increases the speed of the
line. They have but one life to give

Alternatively, we can do as Detroit
has done to the auto plants and begin
the slow conversion to total automation.
Robotics is the new title though. wel-
ders have been replaced by machines
which don't take breaks, don't demand
higher wages, and can't go on strike.
Ones who don't complain of health or
safety hazards on the job. They cer-
tainly can be a shot in the arm for a
company's productivity, but at what
price. Perhaps soon they'll build
robots which can wait in line at the
unemployment office to collect checks
for all the workers they replaced. We'll

have lots of goods,,but there may be no
one with money to buy them, except for
the corporate executives, who could
always use an extra car or two.

VDT's have increased the
efficiency of secretaries
five-fold. Their wages. though,
have dropped as their jobs
are reclassified.

‘Lastly, productivity is to increase
the efficiency of the way workers pro-
duce. The initial attempt in this di-
rection was by Fredrick Taylor called
"scientific management." Time-motion
studies were done to analyze a worker's
every movement and figure out how they
could do it better and quicker. The
only problem being that the scientists

a thing about.the work. They never

better._ The_new approach to increased
efficiency is to introduce new technol-
ogy, such as making secretaries-use .
video display terminals (VDT's) instead
of typewriters. VDT's have increased
the efficiency of secretaries five-fold.
Their wages though have dropped as their
jobs are reclassified. Plus, management
has gained a new degree of control over
their jobs, as they did with the advent
of scientdfic management, which Just
might lead to malcontent and eventually
rebellion.

So this highly touted increase in
poductivity, it seems to me, will be
coming directly at the expense of work-
ing people. It is a disaster waiting to
happen. with everyone applauding loudly
in the wings.

predicting the future

Editors:

Perhaps you have heard
that another steel mill
has bit the dust, a small
one (2,000 workers) in
Newport Kentucky, closed
in August 1980. They're
trying to get federal sub-
sidies to reopen. My en-
tire family's male side
worked there, grandfather,
uncles, father and brother.

One element of the pres-
eent situation is that the
surplus which the steel
corporation used to extract
from workers is being
transferred to oil com-
panies. For years oil
companies have been colon-
izing steel markets by
replacing it with plastics.
Also the steel corporations
are abandoning steel them-
selves and diversifying.
The USWA is also diversify-
ing and will be leaving un-
employed steelworrers high
and dry. Things are going
to get tough.

Dear Editors: « s
This letter brings me
dangerously close to mixing
business with pleasure as I

the best I can do and
although it's not much, I
hope it helps. I must
admit that I don't always
agree with what's written

respect the right to say

The present high interest rate or

_charge, at this writing 19 percent,

could be a spike in the coffin of capi-
talism. -It will concentrate the wealth
of the nation into still fewer hands.
After all, who does it benefit except the
bankers who already have the vaults and
coffers bulging? It doesn't take much
perspicacity to see this. To illustrate:
The Dutch bought Manhattan Island for
$24 about 350 years ago. If that small
amount had been loaned at six percent,
compounded annually, it would now amount
to over 65 hundred million dollars. One

.percent of the population owns 30 per-
‘ cent of the wealth, that including mines,

factories or fields. what money the

‘common man has, due to inflation, doesn't

buy much for the product is priced be-
yond the reach of the common pocket book,
mainlywhy these new, small but fuel-ef-
ficient cars are not selling for the

.interest or finance charge makes the

monthly payment beyond most budgets. The
result is show rooms and warehouses full
of unsold goods - production is way a-
head of the milieu purchasing power.

(The only fast "distribution of goods"
capitalism has is war - the produced
commodity being bombs, shells, tanks,
planes, etc.) Our economic growth is
diminishing, except for the Pentagon mil-
itary spending. American_industry is

not interested in expansion or increased
production - they invest in automation
to reduce costs, labor costs, and this

increases profit. It is called high unit_

profit and low volume - instead of making
and selling say four "units" at 25 cents
profit you sell one at a dollar profit
and make the same buck. We have moved
far away from Henry Ford's high volume
and low unit profit. One reason why no
party can lift England out of the doldrums
is because of this lack of equitable dis-
tribution of wealth. Conservatives blame
the welfare state but the trouble in Eng-
land is that 5 percent of the people own
50 percent of the wealth and 25 percent
is owned by one percent of the population.
Capitalism is not washed up but the de-
tergent to do the job is here - for cheap
labor American industry has gone multi-
national. American finance, investment,
know how and tools have gone overseas.

Taiwan is producing millions of refrig-
erators, washing machines, sewing mach-
ines and TV's with this arrangement. The
obfuscatory fact then is how can the
American worker, unemployed because of
this, and without wages buy what is pro-
duced? Now that we no longer have an ex-
cess profit tax the biggest contributory
factor to concentrated wealth is excess‘

profits. The first sign of vast unemple
oyment should have been the cause of
alarm and action. Unemployment is like a
snow ball rolling down a steep hill. It
gets bigger as it rolls. When cars don't
sell Detroit buys less steel and_the , Z
steel mills slow down and the same applies
to the rubber, glass, etc. that do.into ’
the making of a car. (People are scream-
ing at the 18 and one half percent inter-
est rate for borrowed money but for years
if they used credit cards, have been
paying just that - at l and one half per-
cent a month it comes to 18 percent a
year — Jesse James you could~récognize;
he rode an iron grey horse.) we do not
need to be told that the middle class is
in a toboggan slide down hill. Soon
modern society will be half pauper and
half "Morgan". Government spending or
pump priming has failed. An economic
system in which consumption has to beg
artificially stimulated in order to keep
workers working is a system built on sand.
I smirk everytime I hear the conservative
view of "too many dollars chasing too few
goods". Look at the unsold cars in De-
troit's factory lots and you see the je-
june tone of this. (The 1929 depression
occurred when American production capa-
city was at the highest peak it had ever
been.) .Prosperity depends on the consum-
ing power of the people through the med-
ium of money. The chief source of pur-
chasing power for buying production is,
wages, salaries and income but if this
buying power is small because the infla-
tion dollar cannot buy much then not e-

Anough production will be sold and the

fewer that is sold the fewer that is made

Our Hitler: A Film

  A review by Craig A. Parke

On a Spring day in
Berlin 10 years ago, I
stood and watched a
streetwalker raise her
miniskirt to the gaze
of East German soldiers
who were watching her
through binoculars from
a guard tower on the
other side of the Ber-A
lin wall. She had her
charms, but there was 8
feet of concrete and
barbed wire and a World
war between her and them
and any business deal-
ings.

Going to see a film
about Nazi Germany is
much the same. We are
safe across a wall of
time from those events.
No business dealings.
But always a hint of
prurient interest as we
look through the bino-
culars across the wall
when the skirts are
raised.

Such interest itself
to see documentary foot-
age from works such as
Leni Riefenstahl's THE
TRIUMPH OF THE WILL and
other cinematic specta-
cles of the Nazi era is
quickly dealt with by
Hans-Jurgen Syberberg
in his OUR HITLER: A
FILM FROM GERMANY(1977).
He exorcises it simply
by bringing it into the
film and discussing it.
His stunning film is an
admirable work of seven
hours and nine minutes
that deals with the in-
ner world of Hitler's
creation and not the
hall of mirrors of the
newsreel spectacle that
was projected upon the
outer world. Although

 

 

its vehicle is strictly
surrealism, it ranks
with the great allegori-
cal films of the 1970's
that were likewise about
inner terrain. THE DEER
HUNTER with its story of

the Second Coming of
Christ, and APOCALYPSE
NOW with its depiction
of the Anti-Christ (the
Kurtz of Conrad's fa-
mous short story of
1899, HEART OF DARKNESS
—- the great leader
who will come from the
Middle East in the
1990's, whose armies
will move upon Jerusa-
lem and precipitate
world War III). But
those are works dealing
with the suicide of Mana
playing on_the third
bullet, as depicted in
Nicholas’ suicide scene
in THE DEER HUNTER. The
final bullet of thermo-
nuclear suicide. The

bend of the game.‘

Syberberg's film is
a throwback to simpler
days when we were only

from Germany

_heavy artillery, armor-

playing on the second
bullet. when the wea-
pons were mere tanks,

ed divisions, mass air
forces, and whole civi-
lizations mobilized for
total war. Terrain ‘
well known to the near
capacity crowd at the
screening of Syberberg's'

Hall at Pitt on Nov. 16,
under the co-sponsorship
of the Carnegie Insti-;
tute and the University
of Pittsburgh. ‘"
Susan Sontag in her
7,000 word article on
the film in the NEW
YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS
called it "one of the
great works of art of,
the 20th Century." Al-
though largely ignored
in Germany, the film
has been well received
in Western Europe and
has toured Israel.
Through it, I feel, Sy-
berberg has genuinely
tried to go into that
hell to regain a shred

of the soul of Germany.

\

Certainly anyone who ‘*5; All the great techno-

has ever lived in Ger-
many for any length of
time can sense this.
Despite the gloss of
economic well-being,it
is a psychologically
devastated country. Far
worse than us after
Vietnam. As Americans,
we have a much shorter
attention span. The
Germans tend to dwell
on things.

Up until these last
few years, I had
thought tht the ar-
tists of the nations
had failed Man totally.
My opinion is changing.
We have had some re-
markable films of late.
This important film is
one of them. It is
worth the 7 hours and
9 minutes to try to
learn something from a
war in which 50,000,000

— people died. To try to

learn something from
the 20th Century before
further events rush
upon us as did the
events of the Third
Reich.

Using the visual art
of collage and tableaux
with layers of radio
transcription and ver-
batim monologue taken
from speeches and writ-
ings of the central

‘ figures of Hitler's
‘Reich, the film as-

saults our senses with
a torrent of words and
images. A process Hit-
ler himself used
devastatingly upon the
German people. It was
perhaps his greatest
tactic that made all
the others possible. It
is the underlying theme

. of the film: how the

inner world is pro-
jected onto the outer
world and vice versa.

logical means of pro-

jection of the 20th

Century are experienced.

The written word. The
spoken word. Radio. Mo-
tion picture. The great
world circus and fair-
ground. A world thea-
ter that Hitler suc-
ceeded in shaping to
his own design. Hitler
projecting his mad
dream upon the German
people. The German
people projecting their
dreams and fears upon
him. All of that pro-

jecting upon us. we the

heirs of the great
show. Hitler the great
mass communication Ror-
schach ink blot test by
which to view the ra-
tional, ideological,
and spiritual sensi-
bilities of the 20th
Century.

We get all the well
known views and per-
ceptions of their time
from all the Nazi no-
tables. All well known
words. Nothing new. But
what is new is the
film's 22 chapter
treatment of the sub-
ject matter. The words
are projected into the
heart of a nation bear-

ring a devastating har-

vest of death and de-
struction. It is a
stunning and original
depiction of that im-
mensity of death. No
familiar footage from
newsreels to which
those who were born af-
ter such a holocaust.
have become too accus-
tomed and comfortable.
We get the juxtaposi-
tion of the banal and
trivial with the hor-
rifying and cosmic by
which we are asked to

juxtapose our era a-
gainst his era. Our
world against his
world. Our madness
against his madness.
our great counterfeit
ideas against his great
counterfeit ideas. Our
wagnerian operas
against his wagnerian
opera. Our delusions
and self-deceptions a-
gainst his delusions
and self-deceptions.
Our victories since the
war versus his planned
great victory celebra-
tion in the new German
capital of Germania in
1950. We measure the
Hitler in us against
those up on the screen:
the puppet, mannequin,
actor, and ventrilo-
quist dummy Hitlers. A
grand inner tour of the
core manifestations of
an ideology of national
destruction in the 20th
Century. Hitler the
great epic producer and
director studying the
rushes from his great
feature film pouring in
from all the fronts.
The Second world War
with a cast of millions.
We get monologues
from the servants of
all the Nazi notables
before a huge backdrop

of the Andromeda Galaxy,

as someone beats a drum.
Before the glory of the
Universe, what nation
or government in the
years since our victory
over him is without its
blood and folly? It is
a haunting question.
The final triumph of
Hitler who destroyed us
in our victory over him.
The victory through
which we destroyed our-
selves by becoming even
stronger believers in
the god of nation by

which he lived. The
million dollar defense
budgets. His final tri-
umph over us. We who
constructed-the Mar-
shall Plan to Armaged-

don by which we now live.

The Hitler dummy in
the film is finally
judged guilty; but in
thisvportrayal of the

blindness, madness and A

perversion of these men
of the 20th Century who
led their nation into
death and hell, who

' cannot help but feel

that every nation and
government of the 20th

.Century is also guilty’

in its own way to be
displayed before the
devices of the film.
Is the film worth
seeing? Yes. will it
help us to recognize
the next Hitler? will
art save us? Does it
help us recognize inner
death in the 20th Cen-
tury in the heart of
Man before it is pro-
jected into the outer
world of the shared
being of all of us who
inhabit this planet?
Have we any better
vision? I don't know.

    

After the audience
had reassembled from
the intermission at the
halfway point in the
film, there was a 30
minute panel discussion.
A man came forward who '
was obviously of Ger-
man background. He ad-
dressed us and said
that because he had
lived through what was
up on the screen in
his youth, he felt com-
pelled to say that we
‘must confront it so that
it could never happen
again. That it could
never happen here. He
spoke from the depth of
his being. There was.
general applause. I was
one who applauded, too,
but there was a hollow
feeling in the pit of
my stomach. A feeling
that perhaps it had
happened here already.

That it had happened

the second Hitler had
administered the Final
Solution to himself on

’that day in April 1945

before I was born. That

' the gun had.been passed

to us, the victors, now.
That the gun was now in

 

our hands, pointed at
our heads. That the
.judgement was now upon
us. Upon the content of
our heads, as was so
powerfully portrayed in
THE DEER HUNTER. Man
(Nicholas) before the

»returned Christ (Mi-

chael), whose name is
known by few of mankind,
not recognizing him and
pulling the trigger.
What is one to make
of all this? At the end

' of the film, there is a
~landscape of the begin-.

ning of mankind from

‘which a huge tear hangs.

In the tear sits the

T child. It is something

‘that Syberberg directs
us to in this film as
Cimino does with recur-
ring symbols in THE
DEER HUNTER. The symbol
of the ancient river
that went out of the
garden east of Eden.
The tears of the human

‘ heart. we are all chil-

dren of that tear. with
each new generation,
there is the hope of
that sacred inner jour-
ney back to the begin-
ning.'

In that Syberberg
has taken\it upon him-
self to do this for his

will show the collusion from

 Companies Fight. ll Organize

 

Three years ago I was asked to.
help organize a union in a
chemica1.plant in N. Huntington
Twp., ABCO Chemical. I helped
organize the union which became
an all woman United Steel
Workers of America local.

After the union was voted in
and failed to negotiate a
‘contract with the company, the
sisters called for a strike.
After one year on the street
and still unable to obtain a

working agreement with ABCO',
Chemical, the United Steel ,
Workers of America backed out
and dropped the workers who ,
had voted them in to represent
them. .
Three months ago I got a
phone call from a friend.
asked if I would help her «
organize a union in a warehouse.
I gladly accepted. A

Because I am Vice President
of Local 3730 U.S.W.A., I con-

She

 

 

tacted the Steelworkers first.
Not getting a response in a
reasonable amount of time, I
then contacted Local 926 -
Automotive Chauffeurs, Parts,
and Garage Employees Union and
their president responded
immediately. A
My second choice was my best
move after all. The president
was already familiar with the
warehouse: "Automotive National
Brands Inc." and its company
president and owner. He was
also familiar with the sneaky
tactics that were usually used
by management to try and sway
a "no" vote against union
representation before the
election was held by the N.L.R.B.
After receiving notice from

the N.L.R.B. that local #926
had enough white cards signed
by employees asking for union
representation, the sneaky
moves went into high gear.
First, there was a free beer
party at one of the warehouse
supervisor's home, "Everybody
Welcome." (Two thirds did not
attend). Second, the company
president called some of the
employees into his office
asking them why they needed
union representation?

He showed them hand written 7
paragraphs he claimed be copied
from a contract that another
warehouse had with a union and
that it was no better than what
the company was already giving
them. Then a mass meeting was?

‘called, "All employees must

attend. First thing Monday
morning - no exceptions." One
employee with a sick child at
home was told that he had to

be there and then he could go
back home after the meeting.

Standing in front of all the

employees with a look of serious
concern on his face, the com-
pany president started with a
series of questions and of
course answers. "Why do you
need union representation?

4

Whatnmkes you think a union

can come in here and get you
more money and better benefits?
Well they can not get it for ‘
you unless I give it to them,
and I will tell you right now,
I am not going to do its"
Without changing the expression
on his face, he said, "you

know and I know we have always
been family here. I have
always been like a father to
all of you. I have never

fired anyone because of the

way they parted their hair?"
(But he had fired them because

he did not like their attitudes).

"So why do you need outsiders
to come in here to represent
you? My door has always been
open." What he neglected to
say was that when you did ask
your supervisor if'you could
talk to the president, the
answer you always got was, "not
today, he is not in a good
mood."

Two weeks after the first
free beer party flop, word was
passed around that another
free beer party would be held.
But to the dismay of the
president's sneaky tactics,
six company supervisors were
the only ones to show up.

After receiving the word that
none of the employees showed
up, the president hastily
called a meeting the next
morning and informed everyone
that he would shut the ware-
house in Monroeville down,
and that all orders would be
shipped from Duncansville.

Despite the threat, the
election was finally conducted
by the N.L.R.B. and the union
was voted in by a 19 to 3
margin.

Companies will keep fight-
ing and I will keep organiz-
ing.

“MORALITY OF THE MONTH

Oh, it's so wonderful to
live in such a moral coun-
try as ours. After listen-
ing to Ronnie Reagan I
realized that our people
are good and virtuous and
righteous. More virtuous,
‘righteous, and gooder than
other people. ‘That's be-
cause of our belief in Cod.
And now finally we can have
lots of prayer in the pub-
lic schools. This will at
one and the same time both
prove our superior morality
and help to further raise
it. ‘

I think a good gesture
would be to give out moral-
ity of the month awards.
The first award might go
to Safeway Stores. When
the hostages came home
from Iran, they hung yel-
low ribbons around all
their wilted plants, raised
their prices by $1.50, and
sold out, thereby showing
their patriotic morality,
and demonstratinn that
the good old American spir-
it of free enterprise is
still alive. On the other
hand, they might be tied to
the administration itself,
which in the person of Mr.
Schweiker has announced
government non—support for
and discouragement of con-
traception as well as abor-
tion. This at a time when
the food stamp program,
and school lunches for
poor kids are to be cut
back. (The withhold.-
ing of even further out-
backs on these and other
programs is made condition-
al on the oppositions‘
support of the cuts pro-
posed. Very moral.) A hair

Letters from Behind Bars

being honest

Dear Editor:

I am not sure what de-
partment I should be di- ,
recting this to, so I will
head it your way. I am
also not sure how I man-
aged to get on your mail-
ing list, but having not
subscribed I enjoyed the
paper anyways. Actually
inates enjoy getting mail
from anyone - even old
Tbills, just to know they
are still thought of by
someone.

I would like to comment
on the letter you printed
from the inmate in the Ohio
prison system. Rehabili-
tation, we are not put
here to be rehabilitated.
We are here to be punished
for acts we committed. We
had a choice, and when it
comes down to it, for what-
ever reasons we chose the
course that led to our
being put here.‘ Responsi-
bility is ours.
five years I have heard
every reason or excuse a
person could have for his
criminal acts; seldom do I
hear the truth. And we are
almost all innocent of the
accused crimes. At the
same time more than half
will tell you about all
they had, the one big hit
they are going to get,
the raw deal. Society has
the right to be protected
?r6m us. Rehabilitation
programs should be avail-.
able for those inmates that
have a desire to improve
their lowly state. At the
same time they should not
influence the amount of time

Hey brothers and sisters,
First of all I got to
say man, you guy's are
really making the sun shine
behind these bars and walls
with your magazine.
a few brothers are always
rapping about your magazine
and we want to thank your
good brothers and sisters
for giving it to us behind
walls.‘ ‘
Also I was reading the
Oct. Nov. Dec. MHH1and it
was all really beautiful
until I got to the letter

   

pme tell you something man,

Me and .

In my last ‘

you serve, proceeding in

'this manner a more sincere

group would be involved in
such programs. Secondly,
two issues. First we have
to do a self-evaluation;

we have to have a realiza-
tion of who we are; under-
standing that, we can move
ahead to what we can do.
What are my abilities, Do

I need vocational education,
secondary education, pro-
fessional help. we must be
able to face the fact that
something was/is wrong, and
that we do not fit into
societies so called norms.
But it is easier to complain
about "them" and as long as
we refuse to look at "us"
and take that initiative

for change we will keep cry-
ing and keep coming back. I
believe that this may not be
something you would care to
nrint, but it is an honest
opinion. '

from a Jim Evans called the

your a real live slob you
know that? Man the MHH is

care about your fellow
man? Well by your

letter (Mill Hunk Bunk) I
can say no for you because
you are a bullshit slob..
let's see you get out there
for 53 hours soccer game
for the needy.

But anyway MHH we all
love you man, don't let
some slob get you down
because we appreciate the ,9
MHH and love the brothers 7%
and sisters who put it 33
together.

Also before I go I was
reading another letter“
from Ruth Wangerin and I
would like to say thanks
Ruth for giving $3 to MHH ,
for my subscription, I 1;
Just wish there was more 73
people like you and the
brothers and sisters at
MHH. It would be a better
world to live in. So
thanks again Ruth, you'll
always have a special
place in my heart.

Well MHH stay strong
brothers and sisters,
don't let no slobs get
you down because to me
you'll always be on top
of the world.

Dear friends:

I read with interest the

issue promoting "Quality
Circles". As you can see
from the enclosed news-
paper articles, our union
.takes a very different
'view of "Quality Circles".

Rather than being a step
towards workers’ control,
we see OC's are designed to
set up a "chummy" atmos-
phere of workers and bosses
to get workers to identify
with the interests of the

get workers to begin spill-
ing the beans on each
other. ("What's hindering

, your productivity?" "Those
lazy bastards in the depart-
ment that supplies us,")

As working class leaders,
we should encourage the
idea of class struggle -
not labor-manasement
"egoperation" in pursuit of
"productivity" - which means
less jobs and more profits.

Theater, I could not help
thinking how socially
irresponsible "artistic"
people can be by using a
children's play to re-
affirm the sickness of
segregation and racism
so hypocritically exposed
in our country.

People must understand

,that by portrayins the

servant Wazier with a
black actor, the bad
Zorah, or as a slave of a
white monkey, they are not
contributing in any way to
the ideals of social
eouality and justice amons
black and white people.

These people are respon-
sible for the corruption
of hundreds 0? kids that
will be watching this pro-
duction until March 1.

‘ The misinterpretation of
such an innocent play hy
its staff and directors
is--purposely or uncon-
sciously, but sadly true--
working for free for the
neo-nazis and the pro-KKV
population that torms our

"great moral majority." ’

I feel that this misin-
terpretation is simply ir-
responsible in this era
when so many are tryinr so,
hard to obtain eoual stand-
ing and ennal rights.

Thank you for your
attention to this matter.

‘Sincerely,
Jose Correal
Pittsburgh

"HUMAN INJUSTICE," a ghastly-looking mural in which’

In the spring of 1935 (5
Vanka and his family
traveled across the U.S.,
spending a great deal of
time in California. He
is believed to have
visited Mexico where he
no doubt saw the work of

some of the great Mexicanlti‘

muralists, Diego Rivera,
Jose Clemente Orozco and
others, artists who were
depicting the lives of

the country peasants, of
mill and factory workers.
These Central American
painters focused their sub-
Jects, as did Vanka, facing
the plight of human in-
justice, suffering and the
obscenity of war.

Vanka's style, as seen
in the Millvale murals,
seems to have been in-
fluenced by the Mexican
muralists. Viewers have
noticed similarities to the
Central Americans‘ murals
not only in his subject
matter, and his perspective,
but also in the almost
Hispanic-looking skin tones
and facial features of some
of the Millvale characters.

Vanka completed the
first portion of the Mill-
vale murals, some 10
paintings in all, in an
incredible eight week
period from about April 10
to June 10, 1937.

He was commissioned by
Father Zagar, who, it is
presumed, saw Vanka's work"
when it was exhibited in

 Pittsburgh in 193h—35. His

Millvale work received
widespread news coverage and

;acclaim not only in Pitts-

burgh but through the
national media as well.
Time, Newsweek, a periodical
called Survey Graphic and
other publications all wrote
glowingly of his work. The
Time Magazine article of

July 19, 1937 said his first

;&hase effort "...had put the
parish of St. Nicholas in a
class by itself as harboring
one of the few distinguished
sets of church murals in the

U.S."

A And now, some forty
years later, a grant from
the National Endowment for
the Arts through the I
Pennsylvania‘Humanities

v Council will allow these
a unique paintings and the

remainder,~completed-in
l9hl, to be "rediscovered."
The Iron Clad Agreement,
Pittsburgh's traveling
repertory company
specializing in local
historic theater, will
bring these murals to life
through a six—performance
engagement in St. Nicholas
Church, scheduled for April.

 

Written by Carnegie—Mellon
University professor, David
Demarest, the play will
bring to life Father

Zagar, writer Louis Adamic
and some of the many _ ’
characters depicted in the
murals. A ‘

’And most importantly, it
will characterize Vanka the
artist, a man of peace and
gentleness who seemed to
attract the underpriviledged
of the world, some said in
an almost messianic way.
